[20:43] [Music]
[20:50] is here.
[20:55] [Music]
[21:03] [Music]
[21:12] On down that lonesome road to heaven's
[21:16] blessed abode. For many years I was
[21:20] burdened with care.
[21:24] Though often lightning flashed and
[21:27] raging bellows dashed, my sorrow then
[21:31] was so heavy to bear.
[21:35] But since my Jesus came, oh, praise his
[21:39] holy name, he sheds the light of his
[21:44] glorious grace.
[21:47] And every night and day to him I still
[21:52] awake. I found a blessed
[21:56] hiding place.
[21:59] I found a hiding place. A blessed hiding
[22:04] place. I found a hiding place. A blessed
[22:08] hiding place. There's glory in my soul.
[22:14] Hallelu's
[22:15] role. And since my Jesus came, I'm under
[22:20] his control. He keeps me night and day.
[22:25] He answers when I pray and from the
[22:29] raging storm. To him I steal away. I
[22:34] hear no ters knock. I feel no tempest
[22:38] shock. For in the solid rock I found a
[22:43] blessed
[22:45] hiding place.
[22:48] Just like those wondering Jews. I had no
[22:52] place to choose. Each day I had to keep
[22:56] traveling on.
[22:59] But now I found the way that leads to
[23:03] endless day. No more in darkness I
[23:08] wonder alone.
[23:11] When Satan would alarm, I fly to God's
[23:15] strong arm and hide away in his loving
[23:20] embrace.
[23:22] For in the solid rock, the blessed solid
[23:27] rock, I found the blessed hiding place.
[23:33] I found a hiding place. A blessed hiding
[23:38] place. I found a hiding place, a blessed
[23:43] hiding place. There's glory in my soul.
[23:48] Hallelu's role. And since my Jesus came,
[23:53] I'm under his control. He keeps me night
[23:58] and day. He answers when I pray. And
[24:02] from the raging storm, to him I steal
[24:06] away. I hear no temptor knock I feel no
[24:11] tempest shock for in the solid rock I
[24:16] found a blessed
[24:18] hiding place.
[24:22] I found a blessed hiding place.
[24:29] [Applause]
[24:38] [Music]
[24:46] [Music]
[25:01] I know
[25:03] not what
[25:09] my future
[25:12] holds.
[25:14] [Music]
[25:18] Lord, I have
[25:25] no way
[25:27] of knowing.
[25:30] [Music]
[25:33] But I know
[25:35] the one
[25:41] who holds
[25:43] my future.
[25:49] And I have no fear
[25:57] of where I'm going.
[26:04] Sometimes
[26:05] [Music]
[26:06] it seems
[26:12] like I'm standing
[26:15] still.
[26:21] until I
[26:24] [Music]
[26:27] look back and see.
[26:34] How deep
[26:36] my valley,
[26:39] [Music]
[26:42] how high
[26:44] the hill,
[26:48] [Music]
[26:50] and each step nearer
[26:54] [Music]
[26:57] to eternity.
[26:59] [Music]
[27:05] Sometimes
[27:07] my friends
[27:08] [Music]
[27:12] misunderstand
[27:14] [Music]
[27:20] when I hear the sound
[27:27] of a different
[27:30] drummer.
[27:32] [Music]
[27:34] But I know my life
[27:42] is in
[27:44] his hand.
[27:49] Just as sure as a tongue.
[27:57] Follow
[27:59] summer.
[28:04] I know not what
[28:11] my future
[28:14] holds.
[28:20] Lord, I have
[28:26] no way of knowing.
[28:30] [Applause]
[28:33] But I know the one
[28:41] who holds my future.
[28:46] [Music]
[28:48] And I have no fear
[28:56] of where I'm going.
[29:03] And I have no fear
[29:11] of where I'm going.
[29:14] [Music]
[29:21] [Applause]

[29:29] and sing another one.
[29:32] Let's all stand. How many's ready for
[29:34] the word? Amen.

[37:11] just country folks that just they've
[37:13] been in the message a long time and and
[37:15] they've been through a lot. And we can
[37:17] all identify with those things in each
[37:19] other. Amen. And so, uh, but it's kind
[37:23] of, oh, I don't know. We're kind of

[38:54] And you just you just get to where you
[38:57] miss each other, you know,
[38:59] &gt;&gt; and uh we know that there'll come a time
[39:01] where we there won't be no more goodbyes
[39:04] and and uh we'll all be gathered there
[39:08] at the at the Savior's feet. Amen. What
[39:10] a what a blessed time that that'll be.
[39:15] Amen. We sure do. We always catch the
[39:18] services, you know, when we can. Brother
[39:20] Jason, he'll be I'll be bombing him with
[39:22] Amen Texas and and uh you know, things
[39:26] like that. And and because we're, you
[39:29] know, three hours
[39:31] in the in the summertime, we're three
[39:33] hours uh behind y'all. In the winter
[39:36] time, we're four hours. So, I always get
[39:38] to watch most of the services and
[39:41] things. and and uh I see your faces and
[39:44] I see I I I tell him I said, "Well, I I
[39:47] got to catch the song service so I can
[39:49] uh hear brother Anthony lead the song
[39:52] service, you know, or or uh see my
[39:55] daughter play the piano, you know, I got
[39:56] to try to see him or brother Luther pray
[39:59] for the prayers, you know, pray for the
[40:02] So that's I get a little sneak preview
[40:04] and uh y'all have to stay up late if you
[40:06] want to watch us."
[40:09] And so, but yeah, we just uh bring you
[40:12] greetings from the saints out that way
[40:13] and and uh y'all come see us now here.
[40:18] We appreciate you and and and love you.
[40:21] It was glad to be back in the little
[40:23] country for a day or two and we got to
[40:26] got to do a little fishing in some of my
[40:28] old favorite fishing holes. And so that
[40:30] was nice and uh actually caught a fish
[40:34] or two. So that was real nice. So, we
[40:37] just um want to get get our nerves
[40:40] settled a little bit if it's all right
[40:42] and and we just uh we love you all and
[40:45] and uh you know, we just
[40:50] don't always know what the mind of the
[40:52] Lord is. You know, we we we want to
[40:54] know. We we strive to know the best that
[40:56] we can to find the mind of God to to
[41:00] preach something that's in season and
[41:02] that will be helpful that will help you
[41:05] and to allow you to grow or to give you
[41:09] the the faith that was once delivered to
[41:12] the saints. Amen. Because
[41:14] &gt;&gt; he tells us to earnestly contend.
[41:16] Brother B said if there was ever
[41:18] anything we should contend for is that
[41:21] we should contend for the faith that was
[41:24] once delivered to the saints. And so if
[41:26] we can I have a I have a lot of notes.
[41:29] It could go on uh for for a good while.
[41:33] Uh but um
[41:36] uh we we want to just maybe just
[41:39] encourage you in the Lord and just take
[41:41] a little little thought here just for
[41:44] you know few minutes and and then we'll
[41:48] uh turn to the rest of our day. But the
[41:51] most important thing that we can do in
[41:53] life, Amen, is is to hear and act upon
[41:59] the revealed word of the hour. Amen. So
[42:02] we love you and if you would have your
[42:05] uh take your stand to your feet just for
[42:08] a moment and uh we would like to read uh
[42:13] from the book of second kings
[42:17] and we have the um
[42:21] we have the uh the powerpoint there.
[42:25] I'll try not to be too redundant, but uh
[42:28] we want to read from the book of 2 Kings
[42:32] and um
[42:34] there we want to be in the fourth
[42:37] chapter.
[42:38] They get my PowerPoint up and running
[42:40] here. I I had to take to the
[42:45] PowerPoints. I
[42:47] I normally didn't uh never would use
[42:51] those except for if we were doing like
[42:52] Sunday school or something, but um the
[42:57] um
[43:01] when you get with new folks sometimes
[43:03] you you you say something that Brother
[43:06] Bram said and they look at you like, did
[43:09] he say that or you know, we don't know
[43:11] if he said that or not. And so you have
[43:14] to uh so I got to where I was putting
[43:16] everything up and it just became uh just
[43:20] as easy to to
[43:23] Wow, I don't got that good eyes and tell
[43:26] you right now. Uh so we we'll we'll
[43:30] we'll work with it. And so, um,
[43:35] we, uh, we, uh, got where we was real
[43:39] used to reading from the notes and and
[43:42] the folks kind of liked it where they
[43:43] could just follow along, uh, with our
[43:46] thought and, uh, so you're seeing what
[43:49] I'm seeing, so we'll all be on the same
[43:51] page that way. So, you got a title page
[43:54] for me there, Brother Kevin?
[43:58] All right. Well, we're working on it.
[44:01] But if you have your Bibles and would
[44:03] like to go into the book of uh 2 Kings
[44:07] there and chapter 4
[44:11] and we want to start at verse 10.
[44:18] Amen.
[44:20] Now, just a little background. We have
[44:23] uh this is a story there of Elisha and
[44:28] uh the um
[44:32] the family there that um
[44:36] they built a little little a little room
[44:38] for Elisha to stay in for the man of
[44:41] God. And you remember the story and so
[44:45] uh we pick up there where she's talking
[44:47] to her husband in verse 10 it says let
[44:50] us make a little chamber I pray thee on
[44:52] the wall and let us set for him there a
[44:56] bed and a table and a stool and a
[44:58] candlestick and it shall shall be when
[45:01] he cometh to us that he shall turn in
[45:03] thither.
[45:05] And it fell on a day that he came
[45:07] thither that he turned into the chamber
[45:09] and lay there. And he said to Gahazi his
[45:12] servant, "Call the Shounomite." And when
[45:15] he had called her, she stood before him.
[45:19] And he he uh and he said unto him, "Say
[45:23] say now unto her." So he's speaking to
[45:25] Gahazi, "Say now uh unto her, Behold,
[45:28] thou hast been careful for us with all
[45:32] um this care. What is to be done for
[45:35] thee? whatst thou be spoken uh for to
[45:39] the king or the captain of the host? And
[45:42] she answered, "I dwell among my own
[45:45] people." And he said, "Well, what then
[45:47] is to be done for her?" And Gahazi
[45:50] answered, "Verily, she hath no child,
[45:53] and her husband is old."
[45:57] Man, we'll just wait there for a moment.
[46:01] Amen. As we call upon the Lord. Father,
[46:03] we just ask you now, Lord, as we have
[46:06] looked into the scripture, Lord. We've
[46:09] we just feel your heart this morning
[46:12] just reaching out to the people
[46:16] Lord as we ask you now to come among us
[46:20] Lord just quieten our spirits Lord and
[46:24] just let us Lord just deliver the burden
[46:30] that's on our heart Lord and and just
[46:33] have your way with us each one for truly
[46:36] Lord we're We're among friends and and
[46:40] Lord, but at the same time, we we the
[46:43] word is not common to us and Lord, but
[46:46] it's it's as it was in the days of
[46:49] Samuel. It's precious. Lord, we just ask
[46:52] you now to minister to our every need as
[46:56] we look to thee in the lovely name of
[46:59] the Lord Jesus.
[47:01] The church said,
[47:03] &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you as you have your
[47:05] seats.
[47:08] continue reading here just for a little
[47:10] bit. It's a bit lengthy. That's why I
[47:12] wanted to just get you seated.
[47:16] And he said, "Call her." And when he had
[47:18] called her, she stood in the in the
[47:21] door.
[47:23] And uh let me see if I can I got to kind
[47:25] of multitask here.
[47:30] Hang on.
[47:32] I get synced up here about this season.
[47:38] Yes. All right. Now, that's we got that
[47:40] going. Now, he said, "And about this
[47:42] season, according to the time of life,
[47:44] thou shalt embrace a son." And she said,
[47:46] "Nay, my lord, uh, thou man of God, do
[47:50] not lie unto thy handmmaid."
[47:54] And the woman conceived and bare a son
[47:57] at the season that Elisha had said unto
[47:59] her, according to the time of life. When
[48:01] the child was grown,
[48:04] it fell on a day that he went out to his
[48:08] father to the reapers. And so, we kind
[48:12] of have to bring this up to speed a
[48:14] little bit because if we remember many
[48:16] times, brother Brown talks about this uh
[48:18] this child and he calls it a baby.
[48:22] And you know and and uh we realize then
[48:24] that that a lot of times you know that
[48:26] when you're old even though uh the they
[48:30] could be even teenagers they're still
[48:32] little children.
[48:34] And so you never outgrow. So it's
[48:37] relative. You know you get great
[48:39] grandmas and you could be 30 years old
[48:40] and you're still great grandma's baby.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; And uh so you so you have to and they
[48:46] they still spoil you like you were
[48:48] children. And uh so uh but so so we have
[48:53] to when we look at the story we realize
[48:55] that there's been a time lapse from the
[48:57] time that that Elisha gave the promise
[49:00] of the child to come and then about the
[49:03] time of life which is you know about
[49:05] nine months later she has the baby. Well
[49:07] now then the Bible tells us that the
[49:09] child was grown. So now then grown to
[49:12] what level? We don't know but it's still
[49:14] he's able to be called a child
[49:17] &gt;&gt; and he's able to go out with his fathers
[49:19] to the reapers. So then I have to
[49:21] associate with
[49:23] you know about how old was I when I got
[49:26] to go out with my fathers to the reapers
[49:28] or you know to do things with my dad go
[49:30] cut firewood or whatever the case might
[49:32] have been. Uh what how how old was I? So
[49:35] I you know I'm guessing this young
[49:37] fellow was probably you know somewhere
[49:40] between 8 and 12.
[49:42] It's a close guess to me because by the
[49:45] time a child is 12 in those days they
[49:47] were already uh you know at a time where
[49:50] they could start becoming an apprentice.
[49:53] Uh you know if he's still a child then I
[49:55] figure he's you know up old enough to
[49:58] get up and around and I remember being
[49:59] eight or 10 years old and able to you
[50:02] know cut out through the pasture or go
[50:03] gather the bring the cows in or whatever
[50:06] the case might have been. So, I'm
[50:08] guessing around 8 or 10 just so that we
[50:11] can kind of get a visual of about where
[50:14] this uh child was. And it was on a day
[50:17] we went out uh that he went out uh to
[50:20] his father to the reapers. And um it
[50:25] says there that Whoops, went too far.
[50:28] Slow. He says, "And he said unto his
[50:30] father, my head uh my head." And uh he
[50:36] said to the lad to Aad, one of the one
[50:39] of the other workers that was there with
[50:41] him, young fellas that was helping him
[50:42] at the with the reaping of the harvest
[50:44] said, "Carry him to his mother." When he
[50:47] had taken him, he brought him to his
[50:48] mother and he sat on her knees till noon
[50:52] and then he died.
[51:00] He says, "And she went up and laid the
[51:03] laid him in the bed of the man of God
[51:05] and shut the door upon him and went out.
[51:08] And she called unto her husband and said
[51:10] and and said, Send me, I pray thee, one
[51:13] of the young men, one of the asses, that
[51:16] I may run to the man of God, come
[51:18] again."
[51:21] And he said, "Wherefore wilt thou go to
[51:23] him today? It is neither new moon nor
[51:26] Sabbath." And she said, "It shall be
[51:29] well." Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; And that word there in the Hebrew text
[51:33] is shalom.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; And she saddled and asked and said unto
[51:38] her servant, "Drive and go forward.
[51:41] Slack not thy writing for me except I
[51:44] bid thee." So she went and came unto the
[51:46] man of God to the Mount Carmel. And it
[51:50] came to pass when the man of God saw her
[51:53] aar off, he said unto Gahazi his
[51:56] servant, "Behold, yonder is that
[51:59] Shunomite.
[52:00] Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and
[52:03] say unto her, Is it well with thee? Is
[52:06] it well with thy husband? Is it well
[52:09] with the child?"
[52:11] And she answered,
[52:14] "It is well."
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; It is shalom.
[52:29] the
[52:31] I we skipped the title page there, but
[52:35] it the title that I that I have is not
[52:39] the way that we planned.
[52:43] Not the way that we planned. And so here
[52:47] we find that there was this
[52:50] this little family. They were they were
[52:53] they were knowledgeable of of Elisha's
[52:56] ministry. They understood that uh this
[52:59] was a man of God. They called him a man
[53:01] of God. And they uh they they wanted to
[53:05] do something that would entertain or
[53:08] that would allow uh this man of God to
[53:11] be comforted and to be uh uh
[53:14] convenienced. there within their home. I
[53:17] thought, wow, what a how would that uh
[53:23] identify how would we be able to
[53:24] identify with these people uh in the day
[53:28] and hour that we live, you know, because
[53:30] it's we understand that it's a book of
[53:32] history, but it's also a a book of
[53:36] application that when we begin to look
[53:37] at the Bible that we realize that those
[53:40] stories, the Bible tells us that they
[53:42] were examples for us. And so then so
[53:45] then if we take upon ourselves the same
[53:48] uh the same mentality the same uh
[53:52] thought that the that this little this
[53:55] the Shunomite woman
[53:58] and how that that she
[54:01] uh that she had it in her heart because
[54:05] it's in you know usually it's in the in
[54:07] the lady's minds of sisters that they're
[54:10] given to hospitality that they the Bible
[54:13] tells us to be given to be hospitable.
[54:16] And so as she understood that this man
[54:19] of God would be passing by from time to
[54:21] time, that she was going to be able to
[54:24] do something in order to entertain this
[54:27] this this man of God so that he would
[54:30] have a place and for his servant and
[54:32] himself to stay and to lodge on their
[54:34] way back and forth uh uh within their uh
[54:38] the the whatever the the
[54:41] daily doings of uh of a prophet of that
[54:44] day, whatever it would be they would
[54:46] they would have a place to lodge. And so
[54:49] this entertaining of this this Elijah
[54:53] and I and I thought my how that that has
[54:56] become the very essence of our uh
[54:59] earthly pilgrimage as far as peoples in
[55:02] the earth today that it's always been in
[55:04] our hearts that there's got to be a way
[55:06] or some way or another that we could uh
[55:10] be entertaining to the message of the
[55:12] hour that there would be something uh
[55:14] about God that we could uh make him feel
[55:17] welcome. Is that right? that the Bible
[55:20] tells us that that we have actually
[55:22] entertained angels unawares and so that
[55:26] there's you know so we always try to
[55:28] treat the man of God the way that we
[55:30] would uh that that we would treat the
[55:33] Lord Jesus if he was to be passing by
[55:35] but not so much in a physical realm or
[55:38] physical person like a uh you know a man
[55:40] of flesh and bone but you know there's a
[55:43] there's a message that that uh that is
[55:46] uh entertained that we actually have an
[55:48] Elijah for this day. And and there's the
[55:51] things that are taught within the
[55:53] framework of the message that we embrace
[55:55] and that we bring into our homes and
[55:57] that we want to that we that we want to
[56:00] lodge there. Is that right?
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I want the message of this day
[56:03] to lodge in my home. I want it to be a
[56:06] part of what I do and what I think and
[56:09] and the way that I eat and the way that
[56:11] I sleep and and all these things have
[56:14] got to be something that if it's on if
[56:17] it's in the book, if it's in the if it's
[56:19] on the tape, I want it.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; I want it to be a part of what I do
[56:23] every day of my life. I want if the
[56:25] prophet says it's got to be this way,
[56:27] then I want it to be that way.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Not interested in uh in, you know, what
[56:31] the neighbors think. I'm not interested
[56:33] in what, you know, they do in the other
[56:35] church or what do they do down the
[56:37] street. I'm only interested in what what
[56:39] does that message say for me?
[56:42] &gt;&gt; How does it apply to me? Because I want
[56:44] to be pleasing in the eyes of God. And
[56:46] so, but there's a there's a there's a
[56:49] benefit to that. There's a benefit when
[56:52] we when we resp have a certain response
[56:54] to the word of God and and Jesus, you
[56:57] know, said, "If you love me, you'll keep
[56:59] my commandments." Is that right? And so
[57:02] then the so the commandment of God is a
[57:04] direct reflection of our love for God.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; I always told the people that if there
[57:09] was ever a time that that there was you
[57:11] wanted to show respects to God. Well uh
[57:15] Abraham showed respects. How did he do
[57:17] that? He paid tithe.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; He paid tithe. But his tithe wasn't uh
[57:22] uh you know to make some man rich but it
[57:24] was a direct revelation of his
[57:26] understanding of who Melzdc was. that
[57:30] when he saw that this Melzdc was a king
[57:32] of Salem, then he honored the king of
[57:34] Salem.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. How did he do it? How do you honor
[57:37] a king? By bringing him a gift.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. Because you don't you
[57:44] don't get audience with the king without
[57:45] a gift. Oh my. And so it's not a not a
[57:48] gift of our money necessarily, but it's
[57:50] a gift of our yielding to the spirit of
[57:53] God. And so we want to yield ourselves
[57:56] to the program of God. And we want to we
[57:59] want to entertain the message of the
[58:02] hour. So we found that this woman that
[58:04] she in doing this uh uh uh hospitable
[58:07] act to the to the to the uh to the
[58:11] prophet of God that it reciprocated to
[58:14] her that he now says now then what she's
[58:17] been so kind to us. She's done all this
[58:19] for us. She's she's looked after us this
[58:21] way. What is her what can we do for her?
[58:24] Yes.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; And so, you know,
[58:28] he he starts out a little bit
[58:30] superficial there. He said, "Well, I can
[58:32] get you an audience with the king."
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[58:34] &gt;&gt; that'd be nice. You know, hey, uh that'd
[58:38] be nice if I could say, "Hey, is there
[58:40] something I can do for you? I'll get you
[58:42] I'll get you a White House visit. You
[58:44] know, you get to go ahead and see Donald
[58:46] Trump."
[58:48] That'd be, you know, I I wouldn't turn
[58:50] it down.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; I' I'd like to talk to the fella. I'd
[58:53] have talked to
[58:54] Joe Biden or any of the rest of them,
[58:56] they wouldn't want to hear what I had to
[58:58] say, but I'd still want to talk to them.
[59:00] And you know, it's like like any of
[59:02] them, Elon Musk or any of the rest of
[59:04] them, I I'd love to tell them about this
[59:06] message.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; You see, because that's that's all I
[59:09] have. That's all I that's all I can do.
[59:12] But then it then so but then Gahazi then
[59:16] and I I want you to see how this thing
[59:18] escalated
[59:19] because now then Gahazi says she's
[59:21] childless
[59:23] and so now then it turns from something
[59:27] that's somewhat superficial and you know
[59:30] doable. All right, you know get to see
[59:33] the king. Well, he could probably have
[59:34] have pulled some strings. He could have
[59:36] got it done.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But now it's going to be a little
[59:39] bit different now because now it's going
[59:42] to be she's childless. Now then there's
[59:45] it's going to it's going to go from the
[59:48] from the plausible and the possible to
[59:50] the impossible to the outrageous. Now
[59:53] then there's it's not going to be
[59:55] something that uh that can be um can be
[59:59] achieved in a natural way.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so then now then it goes on to
[1:00:05] say uh and so now then she you know so
[1:00:11] now then he goes and he tells he tells
[1:00:14] it jahazi tells Elisha she's childless
[1:00:17] and he says all right so now then he
[1:00:19] goes and he begins to speak as God
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; because he's not speaking as a man
[1:00:27] because a man can't just say I'm going
[1:00:29] to give you a child
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; here they had already come they were
[1:00:33] old. They were already stricken in
[1:00:35] years. They were already at a place
[1:00:36] beyond childbirth. There was a place now
[1:00:39] that now then when when when when
[1:00:42] uh uh Elijah begins to speak or Elisha
[1:00:46] begins to speak, now he's not speaking
[1:00:49] as a man, but he's actually speaking
[1:00:52] like the one that spoke to Abraham.
[1:00:56] Wow.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; The one that met Abraham, the messenger
[1:00:59] that met Abraham under the under the
[1:01:01] tree under the oak in Mamry is actually
[1:01:04] telling him and his wife who areund and
[1:01:07] 100 years old and 90 that in a year from
[1:01:09] now you're going to have a baby.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; And so now Elisha is speaking in the
[1:01:15] same authority with the same authority
[1:01:18] as the very angel of God. So you think
[1:01:21] that that that when you see what
[1:01:23] happened in the day of of Abraham so
[1:01:27] that they would actually get new bodies
[1:01:30] that they would actually become back to
[1:01:32] a time when they could actually uh have
[1:01:35] children together.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; That there they were. All right. This
[1:01:39] angel of God, brother Ram tells us that
[1:01:42] that was Elohim himself veiled in a
[1:01:46] human body.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? that this is God in a
[1:01:50] human body speaking to Abraham and they
[1:01:53] they they conceive and have a baby.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; All right. That same God masked himself
[1:02:00] in an earthly messenger by the name of
[1:02:03] Elisha and spoke the same promise.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; The same promise. The same thing
[1:02:10] happened. But it happened in Oh, can you
[1:02:12] see what happened in our day?
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Can you see what happened in our day?
[1:02:17] that God came down and used a human man,
[1:02:21] amen, to to project to you a message
[1:02:24] that would literally change your bodies
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; that would cause you to conceive and
[1:02:30] bear Christ the word for your day.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Where are we this morning,
[1:02:36] friends? We're at a time. Amen. It it it
[1:02:39] it and we titled our message, it's not
[1:02:42] the way we planned.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; All right. Because now then this this
[1:02:46] this spoken word has gone forth. He
[1:02:49] spoke to her. She said, "Don't you lie
[1:02:51] to me. This is too serious of a thing.
[1:02:55] I've gone all my life without a baby.
[1:02:57] I've wanted one since I was a teenager,
[1:03:00] but I don't have a baby. I'm an old
[1:03:02] woman. I can't have children. And now
[1:03:04] you're telling me, man of God, that I'm
[1:03:06] going to have a baby." Do not lie to me
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; because this is too serious. you're
[1:03:13] dealing with with emotions that are way
[1:03:16] too out of out of reach for us to
[1:03:18] handle.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Don't you worry this time
[1:03:23] of life. Next year you'll embrace this
[1:03:26] boy." And it happened.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; And it happened. And no doubt that that
[1:03:33] that old man was
[1:03:36] This is amazing.
[1:03:39] The child of my old age. Here I am. I
[1:03:42] I've got this I've got a I've got a son.
[1:03:44] I've always wanted a son. I got a son
[1:03:46] and and and mother's got the little baby
[1:03:49] and and you know how it is. You got the
[1:03:50] baby and all the baby is the centerpiece
[1:03:52] of the family. It rule rules the house.
[1:03:56] Huh? A little Miles, he runs the house,
[1:04:00] you know? I mean, he's he's he's in
[1:04:02] charge and he doesn't even know it.
[1:04:05] And and and and so you find that that's
[1:04:07] the way that it is. And it and and and
[1:04:09] it it it's it he grows up and then he's
[1:04:12] 2, three years old and now they get
[1:04:14] adorable and man you're taking pictures
[1:04:16] and you know maybe not in those days but
[1:04:18] you know how it is with little kids and
[1:04:21] then they and then and then he's getting
[1:04:22] up. He's getting getting older and now
[1:04:24] he's he's you're he's learning things.
[1:04:27] He's getting older. He's five, six years
[1:04:29] old, you know, he's he's he's really
[1:04:31] really, you know, starting to get a
[1:04:33] personality and so forth. And then he's
[1:04:35] 8, nine, 10 years old. He's a little
[1:04:38] chip off the old block. He's wants to be
[1:04:40] with dad all the time. Wants to go with
[1:04:43] dad. Everywhere dad goes, that's where
[1:04:45] that boy's right on his heels all the
[1:04:46] time.
[1:04:48] And so now it it it it's it's it's the
[1:04:52] it's the model circumstance.
[1:04:55] the the the Elijah has gone on about his
[1:04:58] job. He's comes by, sees the family,
[1:05:01] loves the little kid, maybe even
[1:05:02] namesake after him. Who knows? You know,
[1:05:06] everything is going smooth. Everything,
[1:05:07] man, they're growing this kid. They're
[1:05:09] already planning the future for him.
[1:05:11] They've got, you know, got him in the
[1:05:12] will. They've got everything's lined
[1:05:14] out. And then all of a sudden,
[1:05:18] this boy dies.
[1:05:22] I mean, we're we we we've looked we're
[1:05:24] we're we're 10 years in
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; and now the boy gets a brother said he
[1:05:31] probably got a a sunstroke or something
[1:05:33] like that and he dies. The boy is dead.
[1:05:42] We didn't plan on this.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; We didn't we we we got here, but how did
[1:05:49] we get here? We we this is not part of
[1:05:55] the script.
[1:05:57] It's not we didn't get no preview on
[1:05:59] this. We didn't have no we don't know we
[1:06:02] how did we get here? And so we've all
[1:06:05] we've all come through something similar
[1:06:07] to this at some point in our life. We've
[1:06:10] we've lost loved ones. We've lost we've
[1:06:12] lost children. We've lost family. We've
[1:06:15] lost friends. backsliding, left a
[1:06:18] message, you know, abandoned, whatever
[1:06:21] you can. The list would go on. It would
[1:06:24] go on and on because we wouldn't and we
[1:06:27] don't even we we a lot of the time we
[1:06:30] can't even explain how we got here. We
[1:06:33] didn't plan it this way,
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; I would have never planned
[1:06:40] to to to go the the direction that I'm
[1:06:42] going. you wouldn't have direct you
[1:06:44] wouldn't you never dreamed that you
[1:06:46] would get where you are in the condition
[1:06:48] that you're in. It's ne we it didn't go
[1:06:51] the way that we planned. And so when
[1:06:54] when when it when it gets to this place
[1:06:56] then now then you've got to back up.
[1:06:58] You've got to call an audible. You've
[1:07:00] got to you've got to say, "Wait a
[1:07:02] minute. We've got to we've got to do
[1:07:03] something different
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; because it's not the way we planned. We
[1:07:06] didn't we didn't plan on going the rest
[1:07:08] of our life by oursel.
[1:07:10] We didn't we didn't plan on on on you
[1:07:13] know uh being rejected by our family. We
[1:07:15] didn't we didn't we didn't plan on being
[1:07:17] persecuted by our best friends. We
[1:07:20] didn't we didn't plan on that.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; And so now how are we going to do it? So
[1:07:23] now then, do we come to a place now
[1:07:27] where that we begin to complain, that we
[1:07:31] begin to question God, that we begin to
[1:07:35] uh uh uh um doubt the program?
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Because now we've got to we've got to
[1:07:43] we've got to make some choices here.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; All right. The Bible tells us in
[1:07:48] Hebrews,
[1:07:51] try to catch up with you where I can
[1:07:52] read some of this. He said in Hebrews
[1:07:54] chapter 10, the Bible says, "Having
[1:07:56] therefore, brethren, boldness to enter
[1:07:59] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus."
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. by a new and living way
[1:08:05] which he has consecrated for us through
[1:08:06] the veil, that is to say, his flesh,
[1:08:10] having a high priest over the house of
[1:08:12] God. Let us draw near with a true heart
[1:08:19] in full assurance of faith,
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; having our hearts sprinkled
[1:08:26] from an evil conscience and our bodies
[1:08:28] washed with pure water. This is what
[1:08:31] he's going to tell us. Now let us hold
[1:08:34] fast
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; the profession of our faith
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; without wavering
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; for he is faithful that promised.
[1:08:50] I want to
[1:08:53] back up and begin reading again
[1:08:56] from the scripture.
[1:09:15] It's verse 23.
[1:09:19] How do we do this?
[1:09:22] Oh,
[1:09:23] let me get this up for you here.
[1:09:29] Yes, right here.
[1:09:35] So her husband has spoken to her in
[1:09:39] verse 24. And she saddled ass and said
[1:09:41] unto the servant, drive and go forward,
[1:09:43] slack not for writing except I bid thee.
[1:09:46] And so she came.
[1:09:48] So she went and came to the man of God
[1:09:51] to Mount Carmel. And it came to pass
[1:09:53] when the man of God saw her aar off that
[1:09:56] he said to Gahazi his servant,
[1:09:59] "Behold, yonder is that Shoemite.
[1:10:02] Run now, I pray, and meet her, and say
[1:10:05] unto her, Is it well with thee? Is it
[1:10:08] well with thy husband? Is it well with
[1:10:10] the child?"
[1:10:12] and she answered, "It is well."
[1:10:19] So, I want to kind of capture the moment
[1:10:24] that
[1:10:27] her world has just fallen apart.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:30] her her her life is in shambles right
[1:10:35] now because
[1:10:37] brother Bam said that her husband was at
[1:10:39] home screaming and crying.
[1:10:43] You know, everything came to a
[1:10:45] screeching halt.
[1:10:49] Now she's got to find a reason. There's
[1:10:52] actually a place where brother Ram said
[1:10:54] she had to make her way to the man of
[1:10:55] God to find out why this boy died.
[1:10:58] Right. Amen.
[1:11:00] She wasn't necessarily in a place to say
[1:11:03] come and bring him back to life, but she
[1:11:05] was she was in a place to go get
[1:11:07] answers. And that and that was that all
[1:11:10] that stood out to me that you know
[1:11:12] sometimes we can't figure out why things
[1:11:14] are the way that they are.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; We we can't change things from what they
[1:11:20] are. We can't change the circumstances
[1:11:22] necessarily, but we do have a source to
[1:11:26] tell us why. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Now then, the way that we ask why is
[1:11:31] what will
[1:11:34] make the difference as to or not we stay
[1:11:36] in favor with God. If you'll remember
[1:11:39] that brother Brown then I think it's in
[1:11:40] uh uh warning and then judgment. Brother
[1:11:42] Ram talks about how that there was a a
[1:11:45] situation that he had prayed for and
[1:11:48] this girl got well and then it was just
[1:11:50] a little bit later that she got sick and
[1:11:52] died. And then brother Brandham goes to
[1:11:55] God and says, "You owe me an
[1:11:57] explanation."
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; All right? So that's where brother
[1:12:01] Brandham got in trouble with God because
[1:12:03] God told him, said he didn't owe him an
[1:12:05] explanation. God doesn't owe us an
[1:12:07] explanation. But if we ask God
[1:12:10] uh the right way,
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; then God is happy to give us
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; because we approached it in the right
[1:12:19] way. So we realize in our it's our
[1:12:21] approach to God.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; He asked the question the the Gahazi
[1:12:27] asked her, "Is it well with thee? Is it
[1:12:29] well with thy husband? Is it well with
[1:12:31] the child?" And she answered,
[1:12:35] "It is well." Now if we look then a
[1:12:39] little further in second Timothy chapter
[1:12:43] 1, the Bible tells us, "For God hath not
[1:12:47] given us the spirit of fear."
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; All right. So that that there's there's
[1:12:54] a couple parts here that we want to look
[1:12:56] at. First of all, that that
[1:13:01] God is the giver.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; All right? He's the he's the father of
[1:13:06] lights and he's the he's in and every
[1:13:08] good gift comes from him. Is that right?
[1:13:11] And so then he tells us here that has
[1:13:14] not given us the spirit spirit of fear.
[1:13:16] You notice that's a small s that it's so
[1:13:20] there is a spirit of fear that comes
[1:13:22] upon the people
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; that didn't come from God. First of all,
[1:13:26] God does not give that spirit. But he
[1:13:31] has given us the spirit capital S I and
[1:13:36] and this is edited. There's the expanded
[1:13:38] version there. But he ha So the the
[1:13:41] language there he hasn't given us a
[1:13:43] spirit of fear but he has given us uh uh
[1:13:47] the the spirit of power and of love and
[1:13:50] of a sound mind. And that word sound
[1:13:52] mind there means a disciplined mind or a
[1:13:57] temperant mind.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to look at that just
[1:14:00] for a little bit. But first of all, I
[1:14:02] want to back up just a little bit. So,
[1:14:04] so God hasn't given us fear, but he has
[1:14:07] given us power. All right. And that word
[1:14:11] power there is where we get uh dynamite.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; All right. It's it's it's the it's the
[1:14:16] dunamis power. And of agape. That's
[1:14:21] literally the word that's used in the
[1:14:22] Greek text is agape. He has given us
[1:14:26] power. He has given us dynamite love.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He's given it he so we realize
[1:14:33] then it's not it's not uh the the so the
[1:14:37] spirit of power and love and of a sound
[1:14:39] mind is the spirit of God. All right? It
[1:14:43] is the spirit of God. It's not a
[1:14:45] different spirit. It's his spirit. All
[1:14:47] right? And so this is uh the the the
[1:14:50] spirit of a disciplined or a temperant
[1:14:53] mind. I want to look at
[1:14:56] this word uh sound mind just for a
[1:14:58] moment. And it's it's uh
[1:15:04] want you to catch the note here that it
[1:15:06] is God-given.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; All right. Because there's there's you
[1:15:10] know there's human temperance where you
[1:15:14] can join aa and not drink.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Or do drugs or whatever. That's
[1:15:20] temperant. That's a form of temperance.
[1:15:22] But brother Bam tells us that this
[1:15:24] temperance of the Bible is uh is not
[1:15:27] that kind of temperance. But this is the
[1:15:30] from the from the from the Greek text.
[1:15:33] It refers to the concept of
[1:15:36] self-discipline or a sound mind. It
[1:15:39] implies a state of self-control
[1:15:42] and moderation where one's thoughts and
[1:15:45] actions are governed by wisdom and
[1:15:48] prudence. No, then keep this woman, this
[1:15:50] Sarapheneician woman in your mind. All
[1:15:52] right? She came to the man of God. She's
[1:15:55] asked, "How is everything with you? How
[1:15:58] is everything with the husband? How is
[1:15:59] everything with the boy?" She didn't go
[1:16:01] in there and fall apart.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; She didn't go in there and go into an
[1:16:05] absolute panic and said, "You told us it
[1:16:08] was going to be this way and that way,
[1:16:09] and I told you not to lie to me, and you
[1:16:12] gave me that boy, and now he's dead.
[1:16:13] What are we going to do about it?"
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; You know, he didn't she she didn't
[1:16:16] panic. Yes,
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; but she she how does she approach the
[1:16:20] situation? How does she now that life
[1:16:23] has fallen apart? And so that's the
[1:16:25] that's the message to us this morning.
[1:16:28] Life has details. Life has calamities.
[1:16:32] Life has circumstance. But now then, how
[1:16:35] are we going to deal with it? Because
[1:16:37] God has given us a source. We have a
[1:16:41] message. We have a source to draw from
[1:16:44] that we can say, "Hey, I I don't know. I
[1:16:47] didn't I didn't plan on getting here. I
[1:16:49] didn't plan on things being like this,
[1:16:51] but now that it's like this, how do I
[1:16:53] deal with this? I'm not going to blame
[1:16:54] God. I'm not going to question God, but
[1:16:57] I'm going to come with self-control. I'm
[1:16:59] going to come with moderation. I'm going
[1:17:01] to have my thoughts and my actions.
[1:17:04] They're going to be governed by wisdom
[1:17:06] and prudence." In the New Testament,
[1:17:09] it's used to describe the mental and
[1:17:12] spiritual discipline
[1:17:15] that enables a believer
[1:17:18] to live a life
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; that's not appeasing to God, but
[1:17:23] pleasing to God.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; What a difference. We don't just try to
[1:17:28] satisfy God's program by a list of dos
[1:17:32] and don'ts, checklists,
[1:17:35] pluses and minuses, and ABCD.
[1:17:39] No, but we want to be pleasing to God.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so this this this this Bible
[1:17:46] temperance, this Bible uh this this this
[1:17:49] sound mind that that Timothy was telling
[1:17:51] Paul was telling Timothy that look,
[1:17:53] you've got to come to this and it's a
[1:17:56] life that's pleasing to God
[1:17:58] characterized
[1:17:59] by restraint and thoughtful
[1:18:02] decisionmaking.
[1:18:03] She had a donkey ride. I don't know how
[1:18:06] many of you ever rode on a donkey, but
[1:18:07] it ain't fun.
[1:18:09] There is not one minute on a donkey's
[1:18:12] back that you will enjoy. I promise.
[1:18:13] I've been there, done that, got the sore
[1:18:16] tail from it. I mean, they got withers
[1:18:19] that are like this and oh, there's just
[1:18:20] horrible. It's not like a big old fat
[1:18:22] quarter horse. I mean, and so ain't
[1:18:25] nothing good about a donkey ride. And
[1:18:27] she said, "Don't hold up until I tell
[1:18:29] you." And so she had rode that bouncy
[1:18:31] little beast of burden all the way to
[1:18:34] the man of God.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:38] And remember, brother M tells us that
[1:18:39] that thing that Rebecca rode on that old
[1:18:41] camel, he said that was the vehicle, he
[1:18:44] said that was a type of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:46] message.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; So when she rode on that camel all those
[1:18:50] miles all the way back to Isaac, when
[1:18:53] the when the woman of the south, she had
[1:18:55] to ride that camel all the way to the
[1:18:57] wisdom of Solomon. That was the vehicle
[1:19:00] that took her there. It was a type of
[1:19:01] the Holy Ghost. And this Holy Ghost was
[1:19:04] bringing this woman from her
[1:19:06] circumstance
[1:19:08] to the answer.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; And if you stay with that Holy Ghost, no
[1:19:12] matter how bumpy the road gets,
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. it'll get you there.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Thoughtfulness.
[1:19:22] Amen. So,
[1:19:27] brother Bam tells us that Bible
[1:19:29] temperance, this is direct from the
[1:19:31] stature of a perfect man. Brother Bam
[1:19:33] tells us that Bible temperance is how to
[1:19:37] answer back in kindness. And I added
[1:19:40] there because I was thinking of Hadty
[1:19:42] Wright. I was thinking of the Woods
[1:19:44] brothers. I was thinking of the
[1:19:45] different ones that that where the
[1:19:47] spoken word operated in Brother Bram's
[1:19:50] life. It was because somebody said the
[1:19:53] right thing.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; And so that's true Bible temperance. So
[1:19:57] here was this woman. She comes into the
[1:19:59] presence of of the word of for her day.
[1:20:02] She comes into the presence of the
[1:20:04] Elijah for her day and she says the
[1:20:08] right thing. Shalom.
[1:20:12] Amen. The word shalom speaks of peace.
[1:20:15] It is it is actually part of the one of
[1:20:19] the redemptive names of Jehovah is
[1:20:22] Jehovah Shalom and that's with Gideon
[1:20:25] when he built an altar and God tells him
[1:20:29] that his peace will be with Gideon and
[1:20:31] so Gideon builds an altar and at that
[1:20:34] altar he names that altar Jehovah
[1:20:37] Shalom.
[1:20:39] So when you so we realize and the Bible
[1:20:42] tells us that he is our peace
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; and he has broken down that middle wall
[1:20:49] and that middle wall is actually the the
[1:20:52] wall of uh of aggression that was there
[1:20:56] between the Jew and the Gentile. It was
[1:20:58] a it was a it was a wall of adversity.
[1:21:01] And so that wall has come down. It also
[1:21:03] speaks of the veil. So that veil wall
[1:21:06] that has come down that was that was
[1:21:08] that created a a an adversity between
[1:21:11] God and man because the Bible tells us
[1:21:13] that we were immnity with God.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; But then that wall came down at Christ
[1:21:18] when the veil was rent and the mercy
[1:21:20] seat was come in plain view. Then that
[1:21:23] wall of adversity came down. So now then
[1:21:26] uh so he is our peace. So he is our
[1:21:29] shalom. And so we realize then that he
[1:21:33] has given us a spirit, his spirit, which
[1:21:37] is the spirit of shalom. It's the spirit
[1:21:40] of rest. It's a spirit of peace. It's a
[1:21:42] spirit of uh of welcome. It's a spirit
[1:21:45] of good morning. Hallelujah. It's that
[1:21:48] spirit that's a welcoming spirit. And so
[1:21:51] he's given us that spirit. So, if that's
[1:21:53] the kind of spirit that we have when
[1:21:55] we're when we're faced with abs
[1:21:57] adversity, when we're faced with trials,
[1:21:59] when we're faced with with, you know, uh
[1:22:02] uh breakups, breakdowns, you know, all
[1:22:05] these kind of different things, when
[1:22:06] we're faced with those things, then we
[1:22:08] have this approach to God and it's
[1:22:10] shalom.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; We say, "Father, shalom."
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; And he asks us, "How is it with you
[1:22:16] today?" When God comes to ask you, "Hey,
[1:22:20] you're sick this morning. you're you're
[1:22:22] you're afflicted. You've got this
[1:22:23] problem. You've got that problem.
[1:22:25] There's things going wrong. The world's
[1:22:27] not treating you right. You know, the
[1:22:28] job is failed. The the the the bank
[1:22:31] account is empty. The bill collectors
[1:22:33] are coming. The cars broke down. We got
[1:22:35] all these kind of problems. We're sick.
[1:22:37] We're in the hospital. We're going to a
[1:22:39] funeral. We got all these kind of
[1:22:40] things. And God asked you the question
[1:22:42] this morning. How you doing?
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; What's your answer?
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; What's your answer?
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:51] Shalom Lord.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; You are my peace.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:57] Glory to God. Now then,
[1:23:01] shalom is the opposite
[1:23:04] of this.
[1:23:07] The the the the the sound mind, the
[1:23:10] temperant mind, the the shalom
[1:23:13] spirit that God has given us is the
[1:23:16] opposite of consternation.
[1:23:18] Conststerernnation
[1:23:20] is the feeling of anxiety or dismay,
[1:23:25] typically at something unexpected.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; It's a verb that means to fill someone
[1:23:34] with anxiety. Comes from the Latin word
[1:23:38] terrified,
[1:23:40] prostrated. It's where when when when
[1:23:42] when
[1:23:44] life
[1:23:46] falls apart and you can't do nothing but
[1:23:49] lay on your face.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; When you can't do anything but go back
[1:23:53] to bed and cover your head with a pillow
[1:23:56] and and and and say, "Surely it's going
[1:23:59] to be better in the morning." And then
[1:24:02] tomorrow comes and it's not any better.
[1:24:04] whenever whenever when when when when
[1:24:06] life just keeps dealing you uh you know
[1:24:10] uh uh lemons as it were. So this is this
[1:24:15] is this the spirit of consternation.
[1:24:18] And if there was ever a woman, ever a
[1:24:22] family that was faced with the
[1:24:25] possibilities of constrnation
[1:24:28] was this little family in our text
[1:24:31] that here they had they, you know, and
[1:24:34] the Lord knows we've all faced similar
[1:24:37] situations and we could just start
[1:24:38] naming them off,
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; but we're just using them as our as our
[1:24:43] as our uh as our topical in index this
[1:24:46] morning.
[1:24:48] that here was this family. They had
[1:24:50] raised a child to eight or 10 years old.
[1:24:52] This was a promised child that was given
[1:24:55] to them by God.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Through the spoken word, through the
[1:24:59] message of the hour, this was everything
[1:25:01] that they had ever dreamed of. And now
[1:25:06] it had it had come to pieces.
[1:25:10] And so now then here's this family. And
[1:25:13] if there was ever anybody that was
[1:25:16] experienced in the moment of
[1:25:18] consternation
[1:25:20] because that's what would been natural.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; The natural feeling was to be able to
[1:25:27] pull your hair and sit down and cry your
[1:25:31] eyes out and call on God and question
[1:25:35] God and wonder and question yourself,
[1:25:38] question your own experience. How many
[1:25:40] times have you questioned your own
[1:25:41] experience? Yeah.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; When things fell apart and you begin to
[1:25:45] wonder, "Oh, God, I failed you some way.
[1:25:47] Surely this could not have happened to
[1:25:49] somebody that was right with God."
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; And the devil is sit right there.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Remember, hey, don't don't think you're
[1:25:58] exempt, but there was a prophet that
[1:26:00] came to the same place. Wife was dead,
[1:26:03] baby was dying. Devil came, sat on the
[1:26:06] edge of the bed, and told him, he said,
[1:26:08] he said, "It's not because God isn't
[1:26:10] real. is that God don't love you.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And so now then now then you now it's
[1:26:17] consternation now because of things that
[1:26:19] weren't expected. Things are going
[1:26:21] totally the opposite of where they we
[1:26:23] thought they would have gone and they're
[1:26:25] not going the right way. And so now then
[1:26:27] I have to start questioning myself.
[1:26:29] There's something that was unexpected
[1:26:31] here. Now I'm filled with anxiety. Now
[1:26:34] I'm in this terrified wondering if I'm
[1:26:36] even saved. I'm probably serpent seed.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:40] There's no use in going on. I don't need
[1:26:43] to go back to church. I might as well
[1:26:45] just lay out, lay down, give up, throw
[1:26:48] in the towel, surrender,
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; and the devil's going right there. Just
[1:26:54] like the brother said in Sunday school
[1:26:55] this morning. You're sitting on the
[1:26:56] fence. The devil don't have to even
[1:26:58] worry about it no more.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; You're fixing to fall into his lap
[1:27:01] anyways. But no, right now is when you
[1:27:04] got to you got to go back and say, "But
[1:27:06] God gave me
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; the spirit of a sound mind."
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; And that sound mind says, I'm going to
[1:27:13] make spiritual decision making in the in
[1:27:16] the hour of my worst trial.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; When my worst trial comes, I'm going to
[1:27:22] make right decisions. I'm not going to
[1:27:25] choose my own way. I'm not going to
[1:27:26] think my own thoughts. I'm going back
[1:27:29] and I'm going to let the word make my
[1:27:30] thought for me. I'm going to let the
[1:27:32] message of the hour make my decision for
[1:27:35] me because I know I can't make my own
[1:27:37] choice. I know that right now in the
[1:27:39] condition that my mind is in. I will
[1:27:41] blow this thing. I will I will miserably
[1:27:44] fail. But I know the word works.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; It works every time, every place, under
[1:27:50] any circumstance. I'm holding on to the
[1:27:52] message of this day.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, we're 30 minutes in.
[1:28:00] We're going We're doing good.
[1:28:07] Listen to this.
[1:28:10] A Christian's faith
[1:28:14] has to have a solid resting place. You
[1:28:17] know that.
[1:28:19] And the only say only. only
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; only better say it louder only
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; resting place that a Christian a true
[1:28:29] true true
[1:28:32] not some makebelieve not some halfway
[1:28:35] halfbaked Christian I'm talking about
[1:28:37] true Christianity
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; a true bornag again
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; not halfborn
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; not part born but real born
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; like Holy Ghost born
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; huh Yeah.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghostborn Christian can rest his or
[1:28:55] her faith is upon the unmovable word of
[1:29:01] God.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It isn't built upon the
[1:29:04] shifting sands of men's theology,
[1:29:05] doctrines, church affiliation, but true
[1:29:09] believer, his faith rest solidly,
[1:29:11] unshifting
[1:29:13] as he approaches the word of God.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; I know the word is right. Yeah,
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; I know I'm not always right.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; I am most of the time right,
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; but then I was just mistaken.
[1:29:30] If I was anything but right, but
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; I know this the word is always right.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know why that's blacked
[1:29:41] out. Oh, yeah. There we go.
[1:29:44] So the Christian faith is based solidly
[1:29:49] solidly
[1:29:51] upon
[1:29:53] rest.
[1:29:55] Tell you a little story. Most of you
[1:29:57] know brother brother Dwayne Lawson.
[1:29:59] Wayney called him brother Wayne Lawson.
[1:30:02] Super good guy. Dear dear friend.
[1:30:06] We were back back in Shirley Bay. We was
[1:30:08] on a boat. We was back in there fishing.
[1:30:10] And this is Arkansas. So, anything
[1:30:13] that's in the woods back there will bite
[1:30:14] you or suck blood out of you. All right.
[1:30:16] So, it's it's rough back in there.
[1:30:19] Mosquitoes or the state bird, that kind
[1:30:22] of thing. I mean, they they they're just
[1:30:26] big nasty mosquitoes and we're back in
[1:30:28] Shirley Bay and we're getting eat up,
[1:30:30] but there's the potential of big bass in
[1:30:32] there. And so, if there's a big bass
[1:30:34] somewhere, I'm going to be looking for
[1:30:36] it. And so and and brother Wayne and I
[1:30:40] were back there and we had the boat and
[1:30:41] we were and so we we fish a a bait. It's
[1:30:44] called a buzz bait. It's I'm speaking in
[1:30:47] tongues most of you. But at any rate
[1:30:49] this this buzz bait is a top water. It
[1:30:51] sits up it's up on the top of the water
[1:30:53] and you throw it in and then when you
[1:30:54] pull it has a little propeller on it.
[1:30:58] And we we never have figured out why
[1:31:00] fish like it because it doesn't have
[1:31:04] it's doesn't reflect anything that you
[1:31:06] would ever see in the wild. And so we
[1:31:08] call it airplane food. You don't know
[1:31:11] what it is, but you eat it anyway.
[1:31:14] And so, so we throw that buzz bait back
[1:31:17] up under them trees and we pull it back
[1:31:19] out and and then all of a sudden these
[1:31:22] big bass they come up and they just blow
[1:31:23] up on it and it's oh it's just it's
[1:31:25] exciting and it's fun and it's it's it's
[1:31:27] a lot of fun. But those buzz baits don't
[1:31:29] come cheap. And you know, they're, you
[1:31:32] know, four, five, six dollars a piece.
[1:31:34] And so, you know, if you get one stuck
[1:31:36] on a limb or something back up
[1:31:38] underneath them trees, you know, you do
[1:31:39] everything in your power to go get the
[1:31:41] thing loose so you can keep your bait.
[1:31:44] So, he threw back up underneath this
[1:31:45] tree and he got under there and it
[1:31:47] hooked up on a on a on a root ball and
[1:31:49] he couldn't get it loose. And so, he
[1:31:51] said, "Back me under there and get me.
[1:31:52] Let me get my bait." And so, I backed
[1:31:54] him up under there. When he got back
[1:31:56] there, he got down to his bait to get it
[1:31:58] loose. Well, about that time, he stirred
[1:32:01] up a big old river wasp. And in Arkansas
[1:32:04] boy, they call them waspers. And so this
[1:32:07] big old wasper come out of there and it
[1:32:08] hit him on the back of the neck and one
[1:32:10] on the back of the arm. And he started
[1:32:12] squealing cuz they're big old giant wasp
[1:32:15] like that. And he started squealing and
[1:32:17] said, "Get me out of here. Get me out of
[1:32:19] here." And so he got his bait and I got
[1:32:21] him out of there and we got out and he
[1:32:23] was just just hurting for certain. And
[1:32:27] uh so you know he just you know stung
[1:32:30] him twice real bad and and it was just
[1:32:33] starting to swell already and it was
[1:32:35] just terrible. And just something came
[1:32:38] over me and I just went down laid hands
[1:32:40] on him. I said, "Brother Wayne," I said,
[1:32:42] "Brother Bam tells us the secret to the
[1:32:45] supernatural is to relax or rest."
[1:32:49] And I said, "Just relax. Take a deep
[1:32:51] breath. We're going to pray." And I
[1:32:53] prayed for him and we went on fishing.
[1:32:56] It went away like that, instantaneous.
[1:33:00] And by the time we got home, he had a
[1:33:01] little tiny little black dot where he
[1:33:03] got bit. But you know, anybody that
[1:33:06] knows about those things, you spend days
[1:33:08] suffering with those things.
[1:33:10] And brother B tells us, he says that
[1:33:13] Christian faith is based solidly upon
[1:33:16] rest. So now what is it? It's our it's
[1:33:20] our approach. It's our attitude towards
[1:33:23] the promise of God. Are we going to come
[1:33:25] in there screaming and howling and
[1:33:27] ftting and worrying?
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Or are we going to just say, "Well, that
[1:33:33] let's just rest. Let's just relax. Let's
[1:33:35] take a deep breath.
[1:33:38] Think about this for a moment. What
[1:33:40] would what would Jesus do?" Huh?
[1:33:44] A Christian is not tossed about. A
[1:33:46] Christian doesn't run from place to
[1:33:48] place.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; People have to think about those things
[1:33:55] sometimes. You know, I I I learned this
[1:33:58] a long time that geography doesn't
[1:34:01] change your trials.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Will not change. You can think, well, I
[1:34:05] can come here, I can go there, I can do
[1:34:07] this, I can do that. It will not change
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; who you are. You'll still carry who you
[1:34:12] are wherever you go. Yeah.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Whatever you meet, you're still the same
[1:34:16] person. Oh my. So, we don't we don't we
[1:34:20] don't use geography as an excuse.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Not to say that we can't move or go do
[1:34:25] things that we want to do or move to a
[1:34:27] better place or whatever. That's that or
[1:34:29] get under a different ministry. That's
[1:34:31] totally a different thing. The the
[1:34:34] situation deals with you. What are you
[1:34:37] going to do about you?
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. How are we going to are we going
[1:34:40] to uh we're going to have that spirit of
[1:34:43] a sound mind?
[1:34:46] Christian doesn't fuss and fume.
[1:34:49] That's good language.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; You know, we don't we don't fuss and
[1:34:54] fume. We don't we don't and and and it's
[1:34:56] a day and hour where everybody else is
[1:34:59] at fault.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; You ever notice that?
[1:35:04] You just find that that nobody is at a
[1:35:07] place to be responsible for their own
[1:35:10] actions. That their own actions are the
[1:35:13] cause of mom or dad or
[1:35:18] preacher or circumstance or COVID for
[1:35:22] crying out loud. COVID caused more
[1:35:25] problems than he caused overweight and
[1:35:27] everything.
[1:35:33] A Christian doesn't fuss and fume and
[1:35:35] find excuses and blame other people.
[1:35:39] Look inward. What brother Bam tells us
[1:35:42] the zeal of the hour was is to say I'm
[1:35:44] wrong.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Um repent therefore I'm wrong. So the
[1:35:50] zeal of the hour is to look inward. It's
[1:35:52] all it's all over. It's all finished for
[1:35:56] the believer where at Calvary. Years I
[1:36:01] spent in vanity and pride, caring not
[1:36:08] that my Lord was crucified.
[1:36:11] Oh my. Oh my. But it's all finished at
[1:36:16] Calvary.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I was supposed to be clicking
[1:36:20] here and I'm looking down here. See, I
[1:36:21] had it all here for you. Are you reading
[1:36:24] fast? Okay, let's move on.
[1:36:27] That's right.
[1:36:29] Oh, sickness may come, disappointments,
[1:36:33] but the Christian is at rest knowing
[1:36:36] this
[1:36:38] that God is able. Is God able this
[1:36:41] morning?
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; God's able to fix whatever is wrong.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And make it right to keep that
[1:36:48] which he hath performed. The Christian
[1:36:53] rests in that hope upon the stormy sea.
[1:36:56] Sure. I like how he says this. Sure,
[1:37:00] storms rise, all kinds of trouble, but
[1:37:03] we're anchored in Jesus. The storms of
[1:37:06] life all brave. That right. But we're
[1:37:10] anchored. That's all. It It will It'll
[1:37:14] never sink. It can't sink.
[1:37:19] Can't sink. It's unsinkable. This is not
[1:37:22] the Titanic.
[1:37:24] Hallelujah. The Titanic didn't even make
[1:37:26] it the first trip and it was at the
[1:37:28] bottom of the sea.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Oh no, this has got a much much higher
[1:37:34] captain. Amen. I I I've told this story
[1:37:37] here no doubt years ago. Tell it again
[1:37:39] just on my mind.
[1:37:41] There was a ship. It was c making
[1:37:44] transatlantic uh crossing.
[1:37:47] They got uh out in the middle of the
[1:37:49] Atlantic was back in the days of sailing
[1:37:51] ships.
[1:37:53] And in this in the in the days of
[1:37:54] sailing ships, they didn't have, you
[1:37:56] know, weather channel. They didn't have,
[1:37:59] you know, uh, uh, satellite and all this
[1:38:01] other kind of things to tell them what
[1:38:02] the weather was going to be. They just
[1:38:03] had to go and hope for the best.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; And they got out across this in the
[1:38:08] middle of the ocean there. And, uh,
[1:38:10] there was many times that they would
[1:38:12] get, uh, uh, these, uh, hurricanes like
[1:38:16] they have now in the Atlantic. Well, if
[1:38:17] you run into that thing while you're out
[1:38:19] there, sometimes it's going same
[1:38:20] direction you are. And you're going to
[1:38:23] have to ride this storm for days. Many
[1:38:25] times it was weeks on the open sea.
[1:38:29] Horrible, horrible. Many times the ships
[1:38:31] didn't survive it. Many times most of
[1:38:34] the crew and most of the passengers and
[1:38:36] a lot of the merchandise that they were
[1:38:38] hauling didn't make it. When they would
[1:38:40] make it back to shore, it was just a
[1:38:43] just a just a shell of what left.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, in this particular uh uh uh
[1:38:49] journey, they were crossing over the sea
[1:38:53] and they knew they were coming up on a
[1:38:54] on a on a on a terrible storm. And so
[1:38:57] the captain, he tells all the uh
[1:39:00] passengers to go below decks. They
[1:39:02] batten down the hatches. They seal the
[1:39:03] hatches so that the underneath part of
[1:39:06] the uh ship doesn't get water in it and
[1:39:08] the upper decks will be able to shed the
[1:39:10] water and it'll it'll it'll ride the
[1:39:13] waves and so forth. They pull down this
[1:39:14] the mass or the sails and they, you
[1:39:17] know, they just keep the keel in the
[1:39:19] right direction and hope for the best.
[1:39:22] So, the captain tells them to go down in
[1:39:25] the bottom of the ship. Stay down there
[1:39:27] and uh uh don't come out until I come
[1:39:31] and get you, basically.
[1:39:34] And so, they went down into the bottom
[1:39:36] of the ship and they're waiting and the
[1:39:38] storm gets worse and worse and it goes
[1:39:40] on for days, literally days.
[1:39:44] And you can't imagine what the bottom of
[1:39:46] a ship looks like after days of people
[1:39:48] being sick and and and and it just gets
[1:39:52] worse and worse and it just it's just a
[1:39:54] horrible horrible place to be in the
[1:39:55] ship. It's almost as bad as being down
[1:39:58] there as it is out facing the storm. But
[1:40:01] finally, there was one of the one of the
[1:40:03] men said, "We we don't even know if the
[1:40:05] captain is still alive. We don't even
[1:40:08] know if he if we can even we don't even
[1:40:10] know. We don't know what's what's what
[1:40:14] are we facing here. So his days in the
[1:40:16] bottom of the ship. So finally one of
[1:40:18] the goes against the captain's orders
[1:40:20] and he goes and he opens the hatch and
[1:40:22] he crawls out onto the deck and he looks
[1:40:25] and he sees that the captain has tied
[1:40:28] himself physically tied himself to the
[1:40:30] helm of the ship.
[1:40:33] And he's laying there on the helm of the
[1:40:34] ship holding the ship on course. and he
[1:40:37] looks up and the captain catches his eye
[1:40:41] and sees that the captain's still alive.
[1:40:45] And so he goes and he shuts the hatch
[1:40:46] and he goes back down
[1:40:49] and he says, they ask him, "Well, how is
[1:40:53] it?" He goes, "It is well."
[1:40:57] And they said, "What did the captain
[1:40:59] say?"
[1:41:02] He said, "He didn't say anything."
[1:41:04] He said, "But he smiled.
[1:41:07] It's going to be okay.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; We've looked and we saw the face of the
[1:41:13] captain.
[1:41:16] We've seen the face of the captain.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; He smiled. It's going to be okay.
[1:41:22] We've got a We We've seen the smile in
[1:41:25] the word.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's finished.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; It's a He said, "It's finished." He
[1:41:30] said, "My peace I leave with you." Not
[1:41:32] like the world leaves. I leave you
[1:41:34] shalom. Amen.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; I leave you rest. I leave you peace. I
[1:41:38] leave you good morning. It's going to be
[1:41:41] all right. It's going to be okay.
[1:41:44] Amen. Praise the Lord. It'll never sink.
[1:41:48] It can't sink.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Find a place to close here. He says,
[1:42:01] "Now
[1:42:05] you have two different mental
[1:42:07] faculties." Did you know that?
[1:42:11] Actually, there's three.
[1:42:13] At least I know I have three.
[1:42:17] One's in my mind, one's in my soul,
[1:42:20] one's in my stomach.
[1:42:25] I think with my stomach, I can be
[1:42:27] controlled.
[1:42:28] Josie made some cinnamon rolls the other
[1:42:30] day that were out of this world. She
[1:42:32] could lead me around by the nose with
[1:42:33] one of those things.
[1:42:36] Yeah, Paige made some some brownie or
[1:42:39] muffins the other day. Oh my goodness,
[1:42:42] these young girls learn how to cook. My
[1:42:45] be hard to keep them single this rate.
[1:42:49] He says
[1:42:51] you have you have one of them that's in
[1:42:54] your head by your brain.
[1:42:59] The other one is operated in your heart
[1:43:01] which is called your soul,
[1:43:06] your spirit and
[1:43:10] your soul. Now I just made these in
[1:43:13] bullet points so that we could just kind
[1:43:15] of see the process of his thought here.
[1:43:19] He says they are very much in
[1:43:22] disagreement many times.
[1:43:25] So you're many times our mind will think
[1:43:28] one thing and so we look let's look at
[1:43:29] our Shunomite just for a moment that
[1:43:32] there's no doubt she's looking at this
[1:43:34] corpse of her baby
[1:43:37] and her mind is telling her that she's
[1:43:39] been betrayed. She's been lied to. This
[1:43:42] is too much. I can't bear this. This is
[1:43:44] this is this is awful. Uh this is
[1:43:47] irreversible. This is unchangeable. This
[1:43:49] is final.
[1:43:52] But there's something else begin to
[1:43:54] speak. Yeah.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; When that other thing began to speak, he
[1:43:59] said, "When the head seems to say
[1:44:02] something
[1:44:05] and the soul wanders at it if it's not
[1:44:07] right,
[1:44:10] but when it comes into the soul, the
[1:44:12] head seems to step back."
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; And what does she say? "Husband,
[1:44:19] saddle me the ass. I've got to go see
[1:44:21] the man of God." He said, "But it's not
[1:44:23] new moon or Sabbath." She said, "It's
[1:44:25] all right. Peace. It is well."
[1:44:32] I love this quote. He said, "There's
[1:44:34] been things that's happened to you that
[1:44:36] you knew was going to be,
[1:44:40] yet you couldn't explain it."
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; I just sometimes you just know it.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; You can't explain why. And there's no
[1:44:48] reason you couldn't explain it out, but
[1:44:51] yet it just you just accepted it. It
[1:44:54] happened just that way. That's when
[1:44:57] something happens down here. Sometimes
[1:45:01] the soul just says, "It's going to be
[1:45:03] that way.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to argue about it. I'm I
[1:45:06] just know it's going to be that way.
[1:45:07] It's going to happen. I'm not I'm not
[1:45:10] not in a place to explain it. I just
[1:45:13] know that something is going to happen.
[1:45:16] Something good is about to happen.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Something good is on the way.
[1:45:22] Hallelujah. Oh my. That's how she could
[1:45:24] just say it is well.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; It is well with my soul.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When sorrows like sea
[1:45:32] billows roll, I know it is well.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; He said, what do you have to do? Faith
[1:45:39] cometh by hearing, hearing by the word.
[1:45:42] Watch. Here's your here's your here's
[1:45:44] your pattern. Now follow this.
[1:45:47] He said, "And believing
[1:45:50] and applying
[1:45:52] and resting."
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; That that that that's the ticket to
[1:45:58] getting
[1:46:00] in the spirit. It's in it's it's it's
[1:46:03] what brother Ram called believing from
[1:46:05] the heart.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; He said you first you believe by hearing
[1:46:10] the word of God. You apply what he said
[1:46:12] in the word of God, not your own
[1:46:14] thought. You don't reason it out. You
[1:46:15] apply what the word says and then relax.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Rest.
[1:46:22] Amen. Shalom.
[1:46:26] All right.
[1:46:28] I love this thought. He says, "You cease
[1:46:31] from being an alien. Now you are a
[1:46:35] child."
[1:46:37] Look at this list.
[1:46:40] from death to life.
[1:46:44] You're a child of God. You you you don't
[1:46:46] the Bible the Bible tells us that
[1:46:48] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:46:50] you'll never come into condemnation. You
[1:46:54] never come into the second death but you
[1:46:57] move from death unto life. He says from
[1:47:00] darkness into day.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:47:04] From mortal
[1:47:07] into
[1:47:08] immortal. Praise God.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Is that what Paul preached?
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; So that was a resurrection. That's what
[1:47:14] the seed does. If the natural seed does
[1:47:16] that, so does the spiritual seed. We're
[1:47:18] experiencing spiritual resurrection even
[1:47:21] this morning.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; We're living in spiritual resurrection.
[1:47:25] One place, brother, several places.
[1:47:26] Brother B said, you're already
[1:47:27] resurrected.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He uses the word glor from
[1:47:32] uh from you whom he did justify, he did
[1:47:35] sanctify. I mean did sanctify he did
[1:47:38] also glorify
[1:47:40] and so now then we're we're in a
[1:47:42] glorified story state from corruption to
[1:47:46] incorruption.
[1:47:48] All right. Now then these bodies are
[1:47:49] very corruptible. We see that every time
[1:47:51] we look in the mirror.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Is that right? It's getting it's getting
[1:47:56] closer and closer. But what we realize
[1:47:58] then but there's something the immortal
[1:48:00] soul down on the inside is
[1:48:02] incorruptible.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:06] Amen. From weary into joy, from and
[1:48:11] resting fully upon thus saith the Lord.
[1:48:15] Now then,
[1:48:17] we'll try to jump out here.
[1:48:20] He says to the Samaran church, listen to
[1:48:23] this. The key to this age is most
[1:48:27] evidently tribulation. So that was a
[1:48:29] second church age.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; All right. If there was tribulation in
[1:48:33] the first age, there is now predicted,
[1:48:37] listen to this language, an intensified
[1:48:41] tribulation throughout the second age.
[1:48:45] Doesn't stop there. There's no doubt but
[1:48:47] what what uh the following words of Paul
[1:48:50] which we'll read here in a moment
[1:48:53] applied to the mass of Christians
[1:48:57] wherever they were in the world and in
[1:49:01] every age. So if there is an intensified
[1:49:05] from if the first church age had
[1:49:07] persecution and had tribulation, the
[1:49:10] second one had a prophesied intensified
[1:49:13] tribulation and then that was also going
[1:49:16] to be intensified. Remember uh the the
[1:49:19] scale on hurricanes, you know how that
[1:49:21] works. Or the scale on earthquakes, you
[1:49:22] know how that works. You know when they
[1:49:25] say it's a cat, you know,
[1:49:28] one, everybody's, oh, just a little
[1:49:30] tropical storm, you know, it's going to
[1:49:31] be okay. will shelter in place. You
[1:49:34] know, chap, you know, two, some of the
[1:49:36] people leave the some of the people
[1:49:38] stay, you know, a cat three. Well, now
[1:49:41] it's jumping up to 140 plus miles an
[1:49:45] hour. There's going to be power outages.
[1:49:47] There's going to be this, that, and the
[1:49:49] other. The only ones that are going to
[1:49:50] stay are first responders and
[1:49:54] brave people.
[1:49:58] Huh? you get to a cap four, cap five,
[1:50:01] man, get out of here. Only I mean, not
[1:50:04] even the slightest chance of sticking
[1:50:06] around for that thing. You It's It's
[1:50:07] going to be bad news. You're going to
[1:50:09] have 30 foot tidal surges and all this
[1:50:11] other kind of stuff. It's time to get
[1:50:12] out of here. Same thing with an
[1:50:13] earthquake.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, well, it's just a you know, it's a
[1:50:17] two or three on the RTOR seal, but you
[1:50:19] know that it's up by 10 every time they
[1:50:21] add one of those numbers to that,
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; you know. So, it it's intensified. So,
[1:50:26] so is it with in the natural. So is it
[1:50:29] in the supernatural, with the spiritual
[1:50:32] that as the ages progressed,
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; what we're experiencing today with AI,
[1:50:37] multimedia, and and and internet and all
[1:50:40] this other kind of stuff, it what they
[1:50:43] had back in the days of John Wesley,
[1:50:45] come on friends, that was child's play
[1:50:47] compared to what we got today when it
[1:50:49] comes to sin and temptation.
[1:50:53] And so we're dealing with an intensified
[1:50:56] tribulation in the age that we're in
[1:50:58] now.
[1:51:01] Now then he's actually referring to the
[1:51:03] scripture here where Paul uh tells to to
[1:51:06] the Hebrews he said uh but call to
[1:51:09] remembrance the former's days in which
[1:51:10] after you were illuminated you endured a
[1:51:13] great fight of afflictions
[1:51:17] partly
[1:51:18] uh whilst you were made a gazing stock
[1:51:21] both by reproaches and affliction and
[1:51:22] partly whilst you became companions of
[1:51:25] them that were so used. So whenever you
[1:51:27] if if brother Brandham took persecution
[1:51:30] for the doctrines that he taught in the
[1:51:32] day that he was here, how much more the
[1:51:35] church of the living God that is
[1:51:36] believing the things that he taught?
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Because we've embraced these things.
[1:51:41] We've made a we've made a a place for
[1:51:43] the man of God to live in our homes. And
[1:51:46] we got his picture on the wall.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; I got his picture on the wall, friends.
[1:51:50] I'm I'm I'm supporting this thing.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; All right. He said, "For you had
[1:51:55] compassion on me and my bonds, and took
[1:51:57] joyfully the spoiling of your goods,
[1:52:00] knowing in yourselves that ye have in
[1:52:03] heaven a better and an enduring
[1:52:05] substance."
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Now then, the Lord God Almighty says, "I
[1:52:12] know."
[1:52:15] There he is. I love this.
[1:52:18] So when Jesus says, "I know," and he's
[1:52:22] actually referring back to uh uh
[1:52:24] Revelations chapter 2. He says, "I know
[1:52:27] your tribulations." All right.
[1:52:30] Now, he said, "When the Lord God
[1:52:31] Almighty says, "I know."
[1:52:34] There he is walking in the midst of the
[1:52:36] people. There, there he is, the chief
[1:52:38] shepherd of the flock. But does he hold
[1:52:40] back the persecution? Question mark.
[1:52:44] Does he stem the tribulation? No, he
[1:52:48] does not. He simply just says, "I know."
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; That that that should be enough.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; That should be enough to for him to say,
[1:52:57] "I know." ought to answer every question
[1:53:01] that we got. But we we still wrestle
[1:53:03] with it.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; I know your tribulation.
[1:53:09] I am not at all unmindful of your
[1:53:12] suffering.
[1:53:14] What a stumbling block this is to so
[1:53:16] many people like Israel. They wonder if
[1:53:18] God really loves them. How can God be
[1:53:20] just and loving if he stands by and
[1:53:23] watches his people suffer?
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Remember what brother's answer was to
[1:53:27] that question? It's the tender hand of
[1:53:31] Jehovah.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:53:37] they could not figure out God's love.
[1:53:38] They thought that love meant no
[1:53:40] suffering. They thought that love meant
[1:53:42] a baby with parental care. But God said
[1:53:45] that his love was elective love.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; The proof of his love is election. That
[1:53:51] no matter what happened, his love was
[1:53:53] proven truly by the fact that they were
[1:53:56] chosen unto salvation because God has
[1:53:58] chosen you to salvation through
[1:53:59] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[1:54:02] of the truth.
[1:54:06] He goes on as our musicians come. We're
[1:54:09] we're going to wrap this up. Uh he says,
[1:54:12] "Unless we suffer with him, we cannot
[1:54:14] reign with him."
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; You have to suffer to reign.
[1:54:20] The reason for this is that character
[1:54:22] simply is never made without suffering.
[1:54:25] Character is a victory, not a gift. A
[1:54:27] man without character can't reign
[1:54:28] because power apart from character is
[1:54:30] satanic.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; But power with character is fit to rule.
[1:54:35] And so
[1:54:37] we've read this over and over, but many
[1:54:39] times we we we need to keep reading
[1:54:42] because he says, "And since he wants us
[1:54:44] to share even his throne on the same
[1:54:48] basis that he overcome
[1:54:51] and has sat down with his father with
[1:54:53] his father's throne, then we have to
[1:54:56] overcome to visit to sit with him."
[1:55:00] And the little
[1:55:03] Are you reading it? Yep.
[1:55:05] The little
[1:55:07] temporary suffering
[1:55:09] we go through now is not worthy to be
[1:55:12] compared with the tremendous glory that
[1:55:14] will be revealed in us when he comes.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, what treasures are laid up for those
[1:55:19] who are willing to enter into the
[1:55:22] kingdom through much tribulation.
[1:55:25] So then we realize it didn't go the way
[1:55:28] we planned,
[1:55:30] but it did go the way he said. Yeah.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; He said it would come. He said, "I know.
[1:55:35] I know you're going to suffer. I know
[1:55:37] you're going to have tribulation. I know
[1:55:38] you're going to you're going to
[1:55:39] experience all kinds of calamity in
[1:55:42] life. You're going to experience a lot
[1:55:45] of things that you cannot understand.
[1:55:48] There's going to be like one old song
[1:55:50] says that tears are going to run down
[1:55:52] your cheeks unbidden
[1:55:54] because of life and the passing of
[1:55:58] friends and loved ones. And it's it's
[1:56:01] going to happen. We're mortals and we're
[1:56:04] that means we have a we have an
[1:56:06] appointment,
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; you know, and and if the Lord carries,
[1:56:10] we'll see others go by way of the grave.
[1:56:12] We'll have we'll have, you know, but at
[1:56:16] the same time, there'll be new ones
[1:56:18] born. There'll be there'll be friends
[1:56:20] that will experience salvation. There'll
[1:56:23] be life given. It'll be there'll be
[1:56:27] glorious times of baptism and the the
[1:56:31] wonders of the Holy Ghost dealing with
[1:56:33] people's lives. You'll see those things
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; and it's all part of living.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; But now then what about what about the
[1:56:40] attitude that we'll take
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; in the process? Will we face God with
[1:56:46] questions and and accusations towards
[1:56:50] God? Or will we will we be able to
[1:56:54] go with a sound mind and with a
[1:56:56] temperate heart and make Bible choices
[1:56:59] and Bible decisions.
[1:57:05] Oh, that I might have been back there in
[1:57:08] the first age when the apostles were
[1:57:11] first sent out.
[1:57:13] There's no need to look back. Look up.
[1:57:17] Behold, whom is now walking in the midst
[1:57:19] of the churches through all ages. Behold
[1:57:22] him who is the same yesterday, today,
[1:57:24] and forever. And who never changes
[1:57:27] either in essence.
[1:57:31] Amen. The word essence speaks of
[1:57:34] perfume, speaks of it speaks of
[1:57:37] characteristic.
[1:57:39] You know, you you you smell that that
[1:57:42] that that sweet rose of Sharon. That's
[1:57:45] his essence. That's who he is. Amen. So
[1:57:49] he does it it never changes either in
[1:57:53] who he is or the way he behaves. He's
[1:57:56] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:57:59] So therefore, God our father, his
[1:58:02] character and his works prove who he is.
[1:58:08] Amen.
[1:58:10] Can't read that one. Says
[1:58:16] his works cannot fail. His character
[1:58:18] cannot fail. And his works declare his
[1:58:20] character. So he has arisen today and
[1:58:22] he's here in our midst. The same
[1:58:24] yesterday, today, and forever. And we're
[1:58:26] witnesses.
[1:58:28] Are we witnesses of his character? He
[1:58:30] doesn't change, friends.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm glad for it. I know what
[1:58:34] I can expect. Amen.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Things don't go the way I planned, but
[1:58:38] they always go the way he planned.
[1:58:40] Nothing catches God offguard.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Nothing surprises my Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:58:48] Oh, he'll let things surprise me because
[1:58:49] brother Bram said that's the way you are
[1:58:51] with your wife. He said that's the way
[1:58:53] he is with his wife. He likes to
[1:58:55] surprise you. His character has I love
[1:58:59] this. Brother Bam says his character has
[1:59:02] changed me. When it came to me, I was
[1:59:05] once a sinner. Now I'm saved. I once was
[1:59:06] lost and now I'm found. I once loved the
[1:59:10] things of the world. I hate it now.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; My the Bible says if you love the world
[1:59:16] or the things of the world, the love of
[1:59:17] the father is not even in you. So where?
[1:59:19] So do some inventory this morning. Do
[1:59:23] you love worldly fashion? Do you love
[1:59:25] the way the world is? Do you love Do you
[1:59:26] want to look like the world, act like
[1:59:28] the world, dress like the world? Is that
[1:59:29] is that in you?
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:59:34] His character is not in you. If you do,
[1:59:37] Amen. You're you're you got to have his
[1:59:39] if you have his character, you will hate
[1:59:41] the way the world looks,
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; You'll hate its fashion. You'll hate its
[1:59:46] its behavior, its talk, its ways. You'll
[1:59:49] hate everything about it. The prophet
[1:59:51] did.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; I hate it now. I once cared not for God.
[1:59:56] I love him now. Something happened to
[1:59:58] me. Something happened to you. What is
[2:00:00] it? It's God's work declaring his
[2:00:04] character.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Whoops.
[2:00:14] Got a little too excited.
[2:00:20] This is a This is quoted to try to get
[2:00:24] people to come to church.
[2:00:26] I'll just quote it to get people to come
[2:00:29] to God. Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Because you can come to church every day
[2:00:33] of your life and go straight to hell.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; But if you ever come to God, if you ever
[2:00:38] gather with the saints, if you ever
[2:00:40] gather where the saints gather, that's
[2:00:43] in Christ. Listen what he says. Where
[2:00:45] two or three are gathered together in
[2:00:47] his name, there he is in their midst.
[2:00:50] And not only in their midst as a
[2:00:52] complacent onlooker
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; or as a recording angel, but there he
[2:00:57] stands expressing exactly what he is,
[2:01:02] the life and the sustainer and giver of
[2:01:06] all good gifts to the church.
[2:01:11] And the woman said, "It is well."
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; And Elisha said, "Let's go."
[2:01:18] So they went to the house and you know
[2:01:26] everybody said he was dead
[2:01:30] until
[2:01:34] until Elohim came in the house.
[2:01:38] When Elohim came in the house,
[2:01:42] death had to flee.
[2:01:45] He couldn't he couldn't
[2:01:48] death couldn't stay
[2:01:50] because she took the right attitude. She
[2:01:52] she was temperant. She took the right
[2:01:56] she had the right heart, the right
[2:01:58] spirit. She didn't accuse God falsely.
[2:02:02] She She had that same spirit like Job
[2:02:05] had when when the Lord giveth, the Lord
[2:02:07] taketh away. Blessed be the name of the
[2:02:09] Lord. I didn't ask for this. Where were
[2:02:12] you, Job? When the sons of God shouted
[2:02:14] and the morning stars sang together,
[2:02:17] "Where were you, Job? Can you reply
[2:02:19] against a God that laid the foundations
[2:02:21] of the world?" Are you are you in a
[2:02:23] place to to question my majesty? Are you
[2:02:26] in a place to question my decision
[2:02:29] concerning you? Because I know my
[2:02:31] thoughts concerning you.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; They're of good and not of evil to bring
[2:02:37] you to an expected end. You've got to be
[2:02:40] childrained if you're going to make it.
[2:02:42] Every son of God must come by the way,
[2:02:45] amen, of the switch.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; That's the program of God. It's not the
[2:02:49] way you planned it. It's not the way
[2:02:51] that you would have expected it. But I'm
[2:02:53] here to tell you, it's God's way. And
[2:02:55] his way is always the best way.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll go his way. Even if it's
[2:03:00] contrary to my way, if it's I'll think
[2:03:03] his thoughts because they're always
[2:03:04] better than my thoughts.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I say, "Oh, God, help us.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Help us." Amen. That is our our earnest
[2:03:13] prayer as we stand this morning.
[2:03:16] Hope I didn't keep you too long.
[2:03:20] [Music]
[2:03:24] Maybe we'll just bow our hearts for a
[2:03:26] moment.
[2:03:35] Heavenly Father, we're just for just a
[2:03:38] moment, Lord, just to reflect
[2:03:40] [Music]
[2:03:42] We all everyone have individual and
[2:03:45] several trials that we go through and
[2:03:48] are facing in life.
[2:03:52] And
[2:03:54] Lord, we're not here to question your
[2:03:56] will,
[2:03:58] but if we could come and
[2:04:00] and just ask the reasons why,
[2:04:04] we know that maybe you would give us a
[2:04:07] little comfort today.
[2:04:12] Paul said that he had
[2:04:15] learned to be content in whatever state
[2:04:18] that he found himself in. And so, Lord,
[2:04:21] we're we're here to be content this
[2:04:24] morning. We're here to be satisfied,
[2:04:26] Lord, that you are your Jehovah Shalom
[2:04:31] this morning.
[2:04:33] And so, Father, we we we ask you to send
[2:04:36] peace, to send
[2:04:39] grace, to send love, send power
[2:04:44] and love and a sound mind, Lord, into
[2:04:46] the hearts of your children that we
[2:04:48] could in this onward generation make
[2:04:50] decisions based upon the message of the
[2:04:54] day that we've received,
[2:04:56] Lord. that you'll take us into your care
[2:04:58] and into your cover of your wings, Lord,
[2:05:01] this morning,
[2:05:03] Lord. Shelter us, Lord, in the cliff of
[2:05:06] the rock. We pray, Lord. Cover us with
[2:05:10] your mind and with your with your sweet
[2:05:12] Holy Ghost. Lord, we pray,
[2:05:15] Lord, that we could that we could be
[2:05:18] stable, unmovable, unsinkable.
[2:05:22] For Lord, we have looked at the face of
[2:05:24] the captain and he smiled and we know
[2:05:26] all is well.
[2:05:28] All is well.
[2:05:31] We love you, Lord. And we ask your grace
[2:05:34] upon us, Lord, upon this congregation,
[2:05:37] Lord, that you would help them to grow
[2:05:40] in grace and and in your love, Lord. Add
[2:05:43] to them daily such as should be saved,
[2:05:47] Lord. We pray for our loved ones and our
[2:05:50] friends,
[2:05:51] Lord, that you would raise them up,
[2:05:54] every single one. That you would give us
[2:05:56] our children and our children's children
[2:05:58] under the third and fourth generation,

[2:08:49] Faithful, faithful
[2:08:51] [Music]
[2:08:53] you are.
[2:08:57] Isn't that wonderful?
[2:08:59] [Music]
[2:09:01] Forever
[2:09:04] you are Lord. Faithful
[2:09:09] you are
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; like a testimony now. All your promises
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; All your promises are yes and amen.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; All your promises
[2:09:23] All your promises are yes and amen. All
[2:09:28] your promises
[2:09:31] All your promises are yes and amen.
[2:09:38] Hallelujah.
[2:09:43] I believe him like that. Don't you?
[2:09:46] You know, I I was thinking how brother
[2:09:49] brother Dale just crafted that so
[2:09:51] beautifully. I felt I felt this whole
[2:09:53] day I felt so instructed. Started with
[2:09:56] our Sunday school class and
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; I was telling brother Brad how that
[2:10:00] meant so much to me the way he brought
[2:10:02] that thought in for the Sunday school
[2:10:04] from so many different angles. And then
[2:10:05] brother Dale, we were sitting in the
[2:10:07] back talking about some of this stuff. I
[2:10:08] didn't know you were about to bring all
[2:10:10] of that to the pull pit. Mike, that was
[2:10:11] wonderful. I have I have feel benefited
[2:10:15] today, friends.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; How many feel benefited today by being
[2:10:21] in the presence of God?
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and to be instructed. You
[2:10:26] know, I I think about that Shunomite and
[2:10:31] you know, she she's looking to Elisha
[2:10:37] like God, like brother Dale said, you
[2:10:40] know, not a man could give you that kind
[2:10:42] of word. This time next year, you'll
[2:10:43] embrace a child. And so, and the Bible
[2:10:46] teaches that Moses, remember, he said to
[2:10:48] Moses, I'll make you a god and I'll make
[2:10:50] Aaron your prophet. and he gets him
[2:10:52] before Pharaoh and the Bible says he
[2:10:53] made he made Moses a god to Pharaoh.
[2:10:56] Remember that?
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Later on he stood in the gap for Israel.
[2:11:01] Later on he said the Lord your God will
[2:11:03] raise up a prophet like me. See so it's
[2:11:06] not unusual
[2:11:08] Elisha had given her that word. And I
[2:11:09] just thought about that, brother Dale,
[2:11:11] and I thought, you know, today she goes
[2:11:13] to Elijah, Elisha,
[2:11:16] to have him intervene on her desperate
[2:11:20] situation. Sometimes we can get in
[2:11:23] desperate situations. You know
[2:11:25] something? You have the same right to go
[2:11:27] to the same God, to believe the same
[2:11:29] word, and say, "Lord, intervene on my
[2:11:31] behalf."
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; Now, the Lord could have just as easily
[2:11:36] declined. He could have turned her down.
[2:11:39] He chose to bring the child back to her.
[2:11:42] You know, and that's why I I I thought
[2:11:45] how fitting it was, you know, when Job
[2:11:47] is brother Dale finished up there with
[2:11:49] Job and God's answer to Job is so
[2:11:51] poignant to me. Has been for years. And
[2:11:54] God is just saying, Job, listen, listen.
[2:11:57] I I know my thoughts about you. They're
[2:12:00] for good, not evil. I know this doesn't
[2:12:02] look good for you. It's not what you
[2:12:03] planned, but I know what I'm doing. Just
[2:12:06] trust in me. How many will trust in him?
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; And to say, "Lord, you can intervene."
[2:12:11] You see, it's all about and it to me, it
[2:12:13] wasn't as much about God deciding, you
[2:12:16] know, she's going to Elisha to
[2:12:18] intervene. It's not to me as much as God
[2:12:20] deciding to grant it or not grant it.
[2:12:24] It's that she went with shalom.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; Say she went to ex She was going to
[2:12:29] accept whatever God said. She had
[2:12:31] already accepted.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Whatever she already had made up her
[2:12:35] mind is all well. All is well.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; She didn't know whether God would do it,
[2:12:40] but all was well regardless. He's
[2:12:43] faithful, friends. You like serving a
[2:12:45] God like that? Do you like knowing that
[2:12:46] you have the same promises and you can
[2:12:48] go to the same God? Just be sure you go
[2:12:51] with shalom in your heart. Say, "Lord,
[2:12:54] you know your thoughts about me. You
[2:12:55] know what you're doing. It's not what I
[2:12:57] planned, but I'm all for what you
[2:12:59] planned." I have prayed that so many
[2:13:02] times. Lord, don't give me what I want.
[2:13:04] Give me what I need.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Faithful. Let's sing it, Brother Tony.
[2:13:08] Faithful before we go. Amen.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Faithful
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; you are.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; You are
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; all my like a testimony now.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Faithful.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; You should be able to sing with all your
[2:13:24] heart. If you really trust him,
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; faithful
[2:13:30] you are.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Yes.

[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Father of kindness, you have poured out
[2:14:19] great
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; brought me out. Think about that. You

[2:14:31] of mercy. You're my help. My help in
[2:14:34] time
[2:14:36] of need.

[2:14:46] lift
[2:14:51] you.

[2:15:16] more time. Faithful. Faithful. Faithful.
