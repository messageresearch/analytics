[32:48] remembering the grandchildren
[32:51] remembering
[32:52] uh the children and the daughter-in-laws
[32:54] and
[32:55] so i want to be just remembering that
[32:58] whole family it's in god's perfect
[33:01] will to do it that way you know brother
[33:03] harrison actually got a
[33:05] little extra time with us he he was gone
[33:07] i mean when he had went into renal
[33:09] failure and his kidneys were done
[33:10] he was dying i mean just days away and
[33:13] the lord just healed him up by a miracle
[33:15] he didn't even need nothing just
[33:17] came back and remember that come back
[33:19] among us looked
[33:20] looked like he was 20 years old again so
[33:23] my it was wonderful to give him that
[33:25] little bit of extra time
[33:27] amen to give his to seal his testimony
[33:30] amen and the last thing
[33:32] you know he said to me in this world and
[33:35] sarah confirmed it to me
[33:36] as they were gathered around his bedside
[33:39] as he went home you know that he
[33:42] he knew who his redeemer was amen amen
[33:46] and he was counting on that and trusting
[33:49] in faith and the love of god amen
[33:53] so we want to be praying for the whole
[33:55] smith family
[33:57] um i got an update from sister princess
[34:01] but she sent a correction here
[34:02] a clarification let me just read it real
[34:04] quick um
[34:06] so it's she's she's um
[34:10] okay they did they did step down her
[34:12] oxygen
[34:14] and so she she went from being on a
[34:17] bipap mask to a nasal oxygen tube
[34:20] so the next step from bipap
[34:23] is is a ventilator so instead of going
[34:26] to ventilator she went back
[34:27] down to just nose oxygen so the doctors
[34:31] are
[34:31] saying um that there
[34:34] possibly will be some organ damage but
[34:37] sister princess says
[34:39] but we i'm glad she included all of us
[34:41] we don't claim any of that
[34:44] god is able she is still in icu we want
[34:47] to keep her in
[34:48] prayer this morning i think her
[34:51] name is lisa i think sister princess
[34:53] sent me that
[34:54] so god is moving this mountain one grain
[34:57] of sand
[34:58] at a time and she says we're so thankful
[35:01] continuing in
[35:02] prayer for the finished work
[35:10] brother ronald dean spencer is asking
[35:12] prayer for his assembly
[35:15] they are having another
[35:18] funeral we have service today in a
[35:21] funeral for one of our deacons today
[35:23] this is now
[35:24] three coveted 19 deaths in the last two
[35:28] weeks from our church
[35:31] but then he says we are closer home than
[35:33] we were yesterday
[35:35] amen and he says he also is asking
[35:39] prayer he has several tests being run
[35:41] tomorrow which will take all day in the
[35:43] cancer center
[35:45] he says we continue to thank him for a
[35:47] coming miracle
[35:48] amen i personally count every day a
[35:51] miracle
[35:52] just to enjoy amen brother donnie has
[35:54] asked prayer for sister erica who begins
[35:57] some

[36:00] the week they're going to be
[36:01] doing some different things and then

[37:55] we have a certain amount of certainty
[37:57] because we know what it's all about
[37:58] and we know who's in control of it but
[38:00] it is unsettling let's just be honest
[38:02] and
[38:03] it's unsettling that we're having to can
[38:06] only have half the church here week by
[38:08] week it's unsettling that we
[38:10] don't have our fellowship hall opened we
[38:12] lived in that thing man
[38:14] wow it's unsettling you know that
[38:17] we can't just turn around and i'm i'm
[38:19] like the poster boy for turn around and
[38:21] shake hands with
[38:22] and we we can only keep it in limited
[38:24] families and
[38:26] man i'm just so chafing against that and
[38:28] so we're just asking the lord
[38:31] to help us there's so much we want to do
[38:33] we've got some ideas
[38:35] about our harvest fest and how we might
[38:38] pull that off
[38:39] so deb is looking sister deborah is
[38:42] looking into that
[38:44] to see on checking around so we might be
[38:46] able to put something together
[38:47] maybe just pray for me will you because
[38:50] i need the leadership of the holy spirit
[38:52] amen there's cases everywhere brother
[38:55] tim pruitt had
[38:57] more than 70 cases in his church
[39:00] and several of them became critical and
[39:02] very close sister ruth is doing good
[39:04] sister karen is doing good she's back
[39:06] home kovitt hit her and she didn't have
[39:08] one symptom
[39:10] but but then she she was having those
[39:12] seizures and then they figured out
[39:13] that's maybe
[39:15] actually healing inside her brain where
[39:17] she had those bleeds and she's in the
[39:18] hospital for a couple days
[39:20] she's back home sister ruth is uh
[39:22] brother timothy's wife is doing much
[39:24] better almost back home
[39:25] so through it all god still gets all the
[39:28] victory
[39:29] amen these are serious things i'd like
[39:31] to just
[39:32] you know throw caution to the wind but i
[39:34] dare not do that we're just trying to
[39:36] move with prudence
[39:37] as we have been doing from the very
[39:40] beginning that's what we made clear
[39:42] to you not operating out of fear i'm not
[39:44] afraid of it
[39:46] um you know but we want to be prudent it
[39:49] would be a great burden on me
[39:51] you know if someone came here to church
[39:54] and
[39:54] caught or spread that horrible
[39:59] virus we've had several cases but none
[40:02] of them were
[40:04] you know from coming to church here
[40:06] different brothers working in the
[40:07] community and what more
[40:08] but the lord preserved us all so amen
[40:11] enough of that let's uh let's get to our
[40:13] scripture
[40:14] uh in hebrews 13 and i'm not going to be
[40:17] able to read that from second
[40:18] corinthians
[40:20] amen
[40:23] i think i wanted to yes okay
[40:28] we'll let you be seated after this
[40:33] verse 9 hebrews 13 and 9. be not
[40:38] carried about with divers and strange
[40:40] doctrines isn't it amazing he would have
[40:42] to say that to the church
[40:44] for it is a good thing that the heart be
[40:46] established with grace
[40:48] not with meats which have not profited
[40:50] them
[40:51] that have been occupied therein
[40:54] we have an altar whereof they have no
[40:58] right to eat
[40:59] which serve the tabernacle for the
[41:02] bodies of those
[41:04] of those beasts whose blood is brought
[41:07] into the sanctuary by the high priest
[41:09] for sin
[41:10] are burned without the camp wherefore
[41:13] jesus
[41:14] also that he might sanctify the people
[41:16] with his own blood
[41:18] suffered without the gate let us go
[41:21] forth therefore unto him without the
[41:24] camp
[41:24] bearing his reproach for here we have no
[41:28] continuing city
[41:30] but we seek one to come amen
[41:34] let's pray
[41:37] father we're thanking you for the
[41:39] reading of your word today
[41:41] we know that there's life in your word
[41:43] for all who will believe it
[41:45] and we want to confess today that we do
[41:48] believe it
[41:48] and receive it father we have
[41:52] sick requests that are here before us
[41:54] and we have just one other short order
[41:56] of business to finish before we begin
[41:58] our sermon
[42:00] and we're praying that you will meet the
[42:02] needs of these sick
[42:03] and afflicted and and father uh oversee
[42:06] the
[42:07] the next procedural thing that we need
[42:09] to accomplish here
[42:10] we want you to oversee everything lord
[42:12] we want you to oversee all of our lives
[42:15] oversee the word as it goes forth today
[42:17] be with my lips lord
[42:19] may i have nothing to say may i know
[42:22] nothing
[42:23] save jesus christ and him crucified i
[42:25] commit myself to you as your servant
[42:29] standing happily under the blood-stained
[42:31] banner of calvary
[42:33] lord all of our lives now we commit
[42:35] freely
[42:36] willfully and entirely to the blood of
[42:39] christ
[42:40] in jesus name amen if you remain
[42:43] standing just for a moment
[42:45] uh one item that i want to kind of make
[42:48] you aware of
[42:49] is that uh in speaking with the
[42:53] trustees we have currently three
[42:55] trustees
[42:57] and um we have brother mark and brother
[43:00] john and brother charles and
[43:03] because that the the amount of the
[43:06] general fund that is not part of the
[43:10] ministry
[43:11] it's not part of tithing it's just for
[43:13] the general fund of the church which
[43:15] is under the under the direct control
[43:19] of the trustees um because that it is
[43:22] getting to a point now
[43:24] where i felt that maybe it was time to
[43:26] add a fourth brother just for
[43:28] just for um you know for prudence sake
[43:31] and uh just to have a little more
[43:34] accountability
[43:35] uh because the the numbers are starting
[43:38] to to climb to that sufficient
[43:40] level and i thought it would be a good
[43:42] idea i made
[43:44] a recommendation to the trustee board
[43:48] that brother george buckman be added to
[43:51] that team
[43:52] and they with 100 percent unanimous and
[43:56] overwhelming support
[43:57] agreed that that would be wonderful they
[43:59] would love to have his help
[44:01] on the trustees team and i spoke to
[44:04] brother george who
[44:05] took several days to pray about it who
[44:06] didn't make the decision lightly
[44:08] brother george has he won't need
[44:10] on-the-job training because he was a
[44:12] trustee for
[44:13] probably 15 or so years
[44:16] up north at a different assembly so he
[44:19] is an astute businessman a man
[44:22] well known among us of high reputation
[44:24] and regard and has the
[44:25] certainly has has had a great testimony
[44:28] among the saints
[44:30] here for some number of years and so
[44:33] uh with the consent of the trustees
[44:37] we're we're looking to add brother
[44:39] george to that team which will bring us
[44:41] to four
[44:42] uh but because that the trustees are
[44:44] representatives of the people it's
[44:46] different than deacons
[44:48] deacons are an arm of the ministry i
[44:49] choose my deacons
[44:51] and uh because i i have to have the
[44:53] right kind of man that i can work with
[44:55] and because it's ministry deaconing is
[44:57] part of the ministry
[44:59] uh however trustees are representatives
[45:01] of the people
[45:02] to see to the building the upkeep to see
[45:05] keep it from indebtedness of course
[45:07] we've never went into debt for anything
[45:09] we've always paid cash for the purchase
[45:11] the upgrades
[45:12] the increase renovations things we want
[45:15] to do in the future
[45:16] we we looked to maybe we had decided to
[45:19] look and see about
[45:20] building on here doing something
[45:23] different
[45:24] the costs were prohibitive but we do
[45:26] still have some ideas of some
[45:28] improvements to the grounds into the
[45:30] building and the house and the building
[45:31] here
[45:32] so that is underway we'll let you know
[45:33] more about that
[45:35] as that begins to gel but because that
[45:38] trustees are representatives of the
[45:40] people
[45:40] i'd like to give you an opportunity to
[45:42] offer a vote of confidence
[45:44] we're going to ask you to bow your head
[45:46] across the building with all eyes closed
[45:48] and all heads bowed
[45:50] and if if you would like to buy a raised
[45:53] hand
[45:54] let me see your vote of confidence and
[45:57] brother george buchman to join that team
[45:59] raise your
[46:00] hand now yeah that's what i thought bad
[46:02] news brother george you've been
[46:04] overwhelmingly
[46:05] elected amen so thank you
[46:08] god bless you amen we're and we're happy
[46:10] to have you
[46:11] on that team praise the name of the lord
[46:14] all right now
[46:16] god bless you you can be seated
[46:33] amen
[46:40] i want to take my text today i'm getting
[46:43] just a little bit of a late start but
[46:45] don't panic we won't go too long
[46:50] although my family's starting to accuse
[46:51] me of getting a little long but
[46:53] i don't think i am brother dale always
[46:56] said
[46:57] here's what i fear okay here's what i
[46:58] don't as long as it's
[47:00] high octane and you're still pulling
[47:02] sometimes i'll go a little while
[47:04] but brother brother dale in his old
[47:06] redneck cowboy homespun way
[47:09] said brother jason there's no death
[47:11] worse than being drugged to death
[47:14] so we're going to try not to i've always
[47:17] kept that as a motto in the back of my
[47:19] mind lord don't let me drag him to death
[47:21] amen we want to we preach for a reason
[47:25] and a purpose it's not just to hear
[47:26] ourselves talk
[47:27] but we have a burden of the word brother
[47:29] branham called it a burden of the word
[47:31] for the people
[47:33] so we'll i realize i'm starting late so
[47:35] i'll adjust my time accordingly so that
[47:37] we don't
[47:38] keep you here too long it's an important
[47:41] topic the lord placed on my heart
[47:43] we hours of friday morning and i want to
[47:46] take my
[47:47] text my title from
[47:50] the 10th verse we have an altar
[47:54] whereof they have no right to eat which
[47:57] serve the tabernacle i want to take a
[48:00] title
[48:01] this morning no place at the altar
[48:04] no place at the altar there's a lot to
[48:07] be said about that verse and i'm
[48:09] i may come near the end and if i get
[48:13] back to it and the lord
[48:14] leads me i'll begin to break that down a
[48:16] little further but
[48:17] i i i want to just uh preach to you from
[48:21] my heart today can we do that
[48:23] these are these are amazing times that
[48:25] we live in friends and
[48:27] you know i remember years ago a friend
[48:30] of mine preaching a sermon
[48:32] and he took a text out of the book of
[48:34] revelation that every time a seal was
[48:36] opened
[48:37] and one of the four beasts said come and
[48:39] see and he
[48:40] felt inspiration he told me he said he
[48:43] felt that the lord spoke to him
[48:45] and said you know how can the people
[48:47] know me
[48:48] if they can't see me and so i it always
[48:51] stuck with me as a young man
[48:53] just developing my ministry and i i
[48:56] realized that friends we have to be able
[48:59] to detect the movements of god in this
[49:02] age this is a dangerous time
[49:04] this is a serious time this is a time so
[49:07] many things i could just rattle off the
[49:09] top of my head
[49:11] that set this age apart and make it
[49:14] quite
[49:14] unique we realized that this is satan's
[49:18] eden that wasn't even chronologically
[49:21] possible
[49:22] in the alpha church because satan had
[49:24] only had four thousand years
[49:26] and so it would have been kind of a
[49:28] sucker punch from god to only give him
[49:30] four thousand and god took six thousand
[49:33] so the lord gave satan six thousand
[49:35] years
[49:36] to build up his eden like god took to
[49:38] build his
[49:39] and so now you have a prophet comes and
[49:42] preaches a sermon
[49:44] called satan's eden he says things that
[49:46] had never before been true
[49:48] the lid is torn off of hell and demon
[49:51] powers
[49:52] are streaming into the earth that paul
[49:55] prophesied that it would come a time
[49:57] during a perilous time that paul called
[49:59] it perilous
[50:00] but paul goes on to describe how that it
[50:04] would actually get bad enough to where
[50:06] satan himself if you can imagine would
[50:09] be voted in
[50:10] that's my word but would be considered
[50:13] uh the god of this evil age now
[50:17] the reason i say was voted in because
[50:19] satan couldn't just become the god of
[50:21] this evil age
[50:22] because he can't depose the real god he
[50:26] can't overpower god he's been there
[50:28] tried that
[50:29] got some big time beat down trying and
[50:32] so he knows that he can't defeat god
[50:34] in heaven he tried to defeat jesus on
[50:37] the earth took a throttling there as
[50:39] well
[50:39] in the wilderness and so and then and
[50:42] then had his home broken into and had
[50:43] the keys to death and hell stripped from
[50:45] him
[50:46] and all power in heaven and earth was
[50:47] given to the son of god amen
[50:50] aren't you glad that life is now in you
[50:53] aren't you glad that you can say that i
[50:56] and my father
[50:57] are one that's what the devil doesn't
[50:59] want you
[51:00] to believe he doesn't mind you hearing
[51:04] it as long as he can keep you from
[51:05] believing it
[51:07] see so so we find then that
[51:11] that we we have so many things that are
[51:14] unique in this hour
[51:16] we have the convergence never before in
[51:19] history
[51:20] what did the earth suffer under the
[51:23] convergence of the days
[51:25] of noah and the days of lot in the days
[51:28] of noah they faced that like having to
[51:30] face one enemy
[51:31] in the days of lot they only had to face
[51:34] one enemy
[51:34] but we have to face it all around us we
[51:37] now have
[51:38] noah and lot converged on this hour
[51:41] i'm here to tell you something friends
[51:42] you better be glad for a fully restored
[51:45] word
[51:45] it is your only weapon that can defeat
[51:47] the devil every time
[51:50] but now it's one thing for god to give
[51:52] you his word which has
[51:53] power and dunamis dynamites where we get
[51:56] the word dynamite it's what the holy
[51:58] ghost is
[51:59] it's uh if you shall receive power after
[52:01] the holy ghost has come upon you
[52:03] and so you know you shall be a witness
[52:06] unto me now that's god's purpose that
[52:08] doesn't mean
[52:09] you'll always accomplish god's purpose
[52:12] because
[52:13] god's not interested in pushing you
[52:15] through a pipe
[52:16] and making you that kind of an overcomer
[52:19] you're going to have to press
[52:21] the battle you're going to there is a
[52:23] mark there is a prize
[52:24] and you need to press towards that
[52:29] so there is a part that we definitely
[52:32] have to play and i
[52:34] i hope i can get to that shortly
[52:37] so we find that
[52:41] the bible is very specific
[52:44] in in this text that paul is saying
[52:47] listen
[52:48] there is there's an altar that we have
[52:52] and it's a spiritual altar in case i
[52:55] don't get back to it let me just give
[52:57] you a a tiny bit of it now
[52:59] it's a spiritual altar and there were
[53:02] people
[53:03] infiltrating the church they who had
[53:05] gotten you know antichrist
[53:07] a spirit had gotten his agents you know
[53:10] they had gotten inside the wire
[53:11] they were actually corrupting the church
[53:14] from the inside
[53:15] and uh and and they were in disguise
[53:18] they looked like christians
[53:19] they came to church and hung out with
[53:21] the with the apostles
[53:23] uh ananias and sapphira got busted in
[53:26] the open
[53:27] because they lied in the open and god
[53:29] settled used them to set an example
[53:31] but there were many more besides those
[53:33] two
[53:35] we find that the spirit of antichrist
[53:37] the bible says
[53:38] i think john says it was already working
[53:42] even in the in the early church
[53:45] fortunately
[53:45] they had the apostles alive paul was
[53:47] still there the
[53:48] alpha the lion anointing of the pure
[53:51] word was able to combat that deception
[53:54] and until they all died off and then as
[53:57] paul feared grievous wolves came in
[53:59] among them not sparing
[54:00] the flock and during this time of this
[54:04] writing to the hebrews
[54:05] you had men and paul's writing to jews
[54:08] to hebrews
[54:09] and he he's specifically saying listen
[54:12] there's there's there's preachers
[54:14] running around
[54:16] that are trying to take us back to the
[54:19] ceremonial
[54:20] they're trying to make christianity
[54:22] ceremonial
[54:24] they're trying to go back you know well
[54:26] okay paul
[54:27] we realize that it's the blood of jesus
[54:29] that cleanses us and i don't need to
[54:30] bring a lamb but
[54:31] hey we do need altars and we do need
[54:34] shrines and we do need this and we do
[54:35] need
[54:36] you know pomp and circumstance to some
[54:38] degree and we kind of got to have a
[54:40] hierarchical order let's get some
[54:41] nicolaitanism going
[54:43] and and paul is just saying listen that
[54:47] you when you do that you're
[54:51] you're not even a christian
[54:54] and in fact you're so not a christian
[54:58] that you don't even have rights to the
[55:00] altar
[55:01] that we have and that altar is a
[55:04] spiritual altar and it's christ
[55:07] now we put an altar out here of sorts
[55:09] with bread and wine which typifies
[55:12] the broken body and the blood of the
[55:14] lord coming in the new testament jesus
[55:16] left it
[55:16] as a symbolism and we and we re repeat
[55:19] that symbolism
[55:20] uh going forward into the new testament
[55:22] ages but we realize
[55:24] that it's not his literal body you're
[55:27] his literal body yes
[55:28] amen that wine's not his literal blood
[55:32] you're the blood of god by the spirit
[55:34] said a prophet
[55:35] so the you you so the so the book of
[55:38] revelation
[55:40] is god's letter to the last day
[55:43] church because it's he's caught to the
[55:46] day of the lord
[55:47] so it opens up with john caught all the
[55:49] way to the end
[55:50] to give us context of who we are
[55:54] how we got here what all the history has
[55:56] been about
[55:57] and what we are to do going forward to
[55:59] finish the task say
[56:00] finish what task get a body change what
[56:03] the first age
[56:04] fell short of and so we find out that
[56:08] that it was it was not going to be the
[56:11] book of revelation was not going to be a
[56:13] record
[56:14] of jesus of nazareth who walk the shores
[56:17] of galilee
[56:18] for that you have the gospels
[56:21] amen but that and and the church
[56:25] of jerusalem and those early churches
[56:27] for that you have the book of acts
[56:30] but this but the book of revelation was
[56:32] not going to be either one of those the
[56:34] book of revelation
[56:35] was going to be that same god now
[56:38] working
[56:39] inside his church that same jesus not a
[56:42] different one
[56:43] working inside his body in the
[56:46] eternal in the ages to come as paul said
[56:48] in the ages to come
[56:50] so we're now able to look back at which
[56:54] almost all of it is history and we're
[56:56] able to see how that
[56:58] god was moving all through the ages he's
[57:01] alpha and omega
[57:02] we found out in our sunday school lesson
[57:04] on the book of revelation that we're
[57:06] going through
[57:07] that the reason brother branham in
[57:08] several places points out
[57:10] that the reason it says alpha and omega
[57:12] but nothing in between it doesn't
[57:14] mention he's in between
[57:16] now he is because you can read that in
[57:18] the book of revelation
[57:19] he was walking in the midst of the seven
[57:21] lamp stands
[57:22] so brother branham wasn't denying he
[57:25] said i'll be with you even in you to the
[57:26] end
[57:27] i'll never leave you so certainly
[57:30] he was in the middle he was in the in
[57:33] between of the alpha and the omega
[57:35] but what it's meaning is is that not
[57:38] everything in the in between was purely
[57:40] him
[57:40] men were starting to pervert the word
[57:42] and add doctrine and add credo
[57:45] and yet christ is able to maneuver his
[57:47] way and still
[57:48] save his family out of each age until we
[57:51] come to the last day
[57:54] amen and everything is cumulative
[57:57] everything all of the
[58:01] all of the treachery and the goal
[58:04] the modus operandi the objective
[58:07] the deceit the plan the scheme
[58:11] everything that satan was trying in the
[58:14] white horse and in the red horse and in
[58:17] the black horse
[58:19] just kept accumulating until it becomes
[58:22] a sickly pale horse
[58:24] thank god when god combated it with the
[58:27] lion
[58:28] everything of the lion accumulated into
[58:31] the man i mean the ox and then from
[58:33] there the man
[58:34] and now to the flying eagle so when the
[58:37] enemy comes in like a flood don't worry
[58:39] god raises a standard higher it's always
[58:42] higher
[58:43] you don't have to worry the flood can't
[58:45] reach you because the standard raises
[58:47] you higher
[58:49] what's never going to be changed is that
[58:52] jesus
[58:53] put satan under his feet and he's now
[58:55] under your feet
[58:56] and that will never ever ever
[59:00] ever did i say ever ever change
[59:04] amen praise god and finally he'll even
[59:07] be destroyed understand this friends
[59:09] that satan's tyranny
[59:11] over god's family is done
[59:14] calvary finished it he resurrected he
[59:18] stripped him of death in hell emptied
[59:19] out paradise satan
[59:21] was powerless to stop him amen
[59:26] so there's where we are we've come now
[59:30] and now this this becomes so important
[59:34] to us
[59:35] because i'm going to look at some
[59:37] scriptures and
[59:39] they're not they're only indirectly
[59:40] related
[59:42] to what i'm preaching on so don't go too
[59:44] far down a rabbit hole
[59:46] i'm just using a specific thing to
[59:49] connect
[59:49] connect a dot all right and and uh and
[59:52] the
[59:53] the illustration i'm trying to show you
[59:56] through several bible passages
[59:58] is that is that there is um
[1:00:03] just like you have salvation offered to
[1:00:06] all men
[1:00:08] but then besides that there's election
[1:00:11] which is god's redeemable and redeemed
[1:00:14] family
[1:00:15] so he offers a legitimate non-facetious
[1:00:19] chance for every man to save himself he
[1:00:21] even offered it to king
[1:00:23] he could never break that pattern he
[1:00:25] knew cain wouldn't take it but he still
[1:00:27] had to offer it had to be a legit
[1:00:28] offering too
[1:00:30] and so so it wasn't that he was offering
[1:00:32] cain a revelation because
[1:00:34] the only one who can get the real
[1:00:35] revelation is the elect family
[1:00:38] and the reason the reason for that is
[1:00:41] because revelation's not a
[1:00:42] teaching or a doctrine
[1:00:45] revelation is a happening it's not an
[1:00:48] understanding it's a happening where
[1:00:51] some element inside you called a gene of
[1:00:53] god
[1:00:54] here's the word which is light flashes
[1:00:56] on a seed and it comes to life
[1:00:58] and you've had an experience you might
[1:01:01] not know the first thing about doctrine
[1:01:02] but you've already had an experience
[1:01:06] your brand new creation in christ jesus
[1:01:09] now that's something that anyone outside
[1:01:11] of the gene family
[1:01:13] no one can have that they can god gives
[1:01:16] them a path to save themselves
[1:01:19] from destruction and he will save them
[1:01:22] if they'll meet
[1:01:23] he told cain look you're there's no way
[1:01:25] for you to get this revelation it's not
[1:01:27] in you
[1:01:30] the revelation is actually already was
[1:01:32] already in
[1:01:33] abel when he was born it just was
[1:01:35] dormant all i did was come to abel and
[1:01:38] turn it on
[1:01:40] and abel said wow i need a lamb
[1:01:44] that that seed came to life and he's
[1:01:45] simply saying to cain
[1:01:47] there's nothing in you to click on
[1:01:49] there's nothing for there's no seed for
[1:01:51] my light to shine
[1:01:52] on to bring it to a crop however
[1:01:55] if you will just do as those
[1:01:58] and jesus picks it up in matthew 25 if
[1:02:01] you will just give honor to
[1:02:03] your brother and find a way in this life
[1:02:06] to honor
[1:02:07] who he is and just try your best to do
[1:02:10] like him and just
[1:02:10] emulate him i'll grant you eternal life
[1:02:13] you don't have to worry
[1:02:14] i got a plan for you you'd think cain
[1:02:18] would have took that deal
[1:02:20] not only did he not take that deal he
[1:02:22] did the polar
[1:02:24] opposite amen he killed him
[1:02:30] so he finished himself because you know
[1:02:33] i mean he stepped beyond all
[1:02:34] bounds of grace and mercy and there was
[1:02:37] no coming back from that
[1:02:39] and so he received a mark and that's the
[1:02:41] pattern god would use
[1:02:42] and so all through the scripture
[1:02:46] you'll find these examples of the
[1:02:50] of the word of god separating humanity
[1:02:52] into their
[1:02:53] respective categories here's one in john
[1:02:56] chapter 8
[1:02:58] verse 34 to 37.
[1:03:01] jesus answered them verily verily i say
[1:03:04] unto you
[1:03:05] whosoever committeth sin is the servant
[1:03:07] of sin
[1:03:08] and the servant abideth not in the house
[1:03:10] forever but the son abideth ever
[1:03:13] if the son therefore shall make you free
[1:03:16] ye shall be free
[1:03:17] indeed i know that ye are abraham's seed
[1:03:22] physically they were jesus never argued
[1:03:25] that
[1:03:26] they actually could prove it it wouldn't
[1:03:28] have done him any good to argue it they
[1:03:29] had
[1:03:30] their own records of their family tree i
[1:03:32] know you are abraham's seed
[1:03:34] but now watch him move to something
[1:03:36] beyond physical it goes down to
[1:03:38] spiritual
[1:03:39] but ye seek to kill me because
[1:03:42] my word hath no place in you
[1:03:46] amen so now you can see it's not
[1:03:49] arrogance and saint paul
[1:03:53] when he says we have a table they don't
[1:03:56] even have a right to
[1:03:58] amen if they want to if they want to
[1:04:01] worry about
[1:04:02] you know meats and sabbaths and days and
[1:04:04] legalism
[1:04:05] and and and they want to earn their
[1:04:07] salvation that way
[1:04:08] they want to have some semblance of you
[1:04:10] know that's that's the mistake
[1:04:12] my countrymen made they wanted to have a
[1:04:15] law
[1:04:16] they wanted to have a part they wanted
[1:04:18] to have a they wanted to be able to get
[1:04:20] a report card
[1:04:21] they wanted to be able to you know have
[1:04:22] standards we could measure by
[1:04:24] and paul the whole the good news the
[1:04:26] good news
[1:04:28] the good news of the gospel is you don't
[1:04:30] have to do that anymore
[1:04:33] you don't have to fight to be of god you
[1:04:36] can just surrender and he'll
[1:04:37] he'll turn you into it that's the beauty
[1:04:40] holy ghost isn't hard to get all you
[1:04:42] have to do is surrender see
[1:04:44] and that's why people don't get it
[1:04:46] because they don't surrender
[1:04:48] they're happy to surrender all the stuff
[1:04:50] that's causing them problems but the
[1:04:52] stuff they like they want to hang on to
[1:04:54] you'll never get born again doing that
[1:04:56] it's impossible he'll never give you
[1:04:57] that
[1:04:58] because that's where brother branham
[1:04:59] says the boxcar is not
[1:05:01] it's not tightly packed he can look that
[1:05:03] box car's your heart
[1:05:05] he can look inside there and see that
[1:05:07] your heart's not correct you're not
[1:05:08] fully surrendering yet and he will not
[1:05:10] close the door and seal it
[1:05:12] see and so so we find out
[1:05:15] that he says and and so
[1:05:19] um all right back to our
[1:05:22] uh verse 37 i know that you're abraham's
[1:05:25] seed
[1:05:26] but you seek to kill me because my word
[1:05:29] hath no place in you we're preaching
[1:05:32] today on no place
[1:05:33] at the altar hebrews chapter 12
[1:05:37] formerly in the same letter he's
[1:05:38] speaking to these same hebrews
[1:05:40] verse 16 to 17 lest there be
[1:05:44] any fornicator or profane person
[1:05:47] as esau see paul at this point
[1:05:51] already knows the church has been
[1:05:53] infiltrated
[1:05:54] yes amen he's already aware that the
[1:05:57] enemies got inside our wire
[1:05:59] and he's behind enemy lines and
[1:06:03] we need to we need to start preaching on
[1:06:05] some of these things
[1:06:06] all right so so that this isn't a sermon
[1:06:10] you don't hear peter having to preach
[1:06:14] like this
[1:06:15] in the upper room because
[1:06:18] all 120 people got born again
[1:06:22] and peter didn't have to spend one
[1:06:24] second preaching against sin and
[1:06:26] carnality
[1:06:27] he could immediately just identify
[1:06:30] modern events
[1:06:31] made clear with prophecy and that's
[1:06:34] that's
[1:06:34] that's that's when the church is at its
[1:06:36] zenith
[1:06:37] when all the people are one for all and
[1:06:40] everybody has given their heart to the
[1:06:41] lord
[1:06:42] and we universally have the holy ghost
[1:06:44] and we don't stop until we
[1:06:46] get it amen listen friends uh
[1:06:49] you know even even here even here we
[1:06:53] come to a building
[1:06:54] and we have a building and you know we
[1:06:56] we have an altar and
[1:06:58] you know i i get that that these are
[1:07:00] these are creations that came down
[1:07:02] through the ages
[1:07:03] in the early church they they didn't
[1:07:05] have any of that kind of stuff
[1:07:06] they just went from house to house
[1:07:08] breaking bread and preaching the gospel
[1:07:10] did you know that that the that the uh
[1:07:14] people of the the local people of the
[1:07:16] day
[1:07:17] when they looked at those early
[1:07:18] christians thought that they weren't
[1:07:20] even
[1:07:21] they weren't even godly at all because
[1:07:22] they didn't go to a temple
[1:07:24] amen and the jews here here the jews are
[1:07:27] going over their temples seeing all
[1:07:28] those christians over there in a big
[1:07:30] circle out in the field singing
[1:07:32] and like you're not going into the
[1:07:33] temple to worship god no we have god in
[1:07:35] our heart
[1:07:36] oh that's blasphemy well okay you carry
[1:07:39] on we'll carry on
[1:07:40] they didn't even consider them to be
[1:07:44] holy they considered them unrighteous
[1:07:46] because they didn't meet in
[1:07:47] buildings they didn't have altars they
[1:07:49] didn't have any of that kind of stuff
[1:07:51] you understand and that become something
[1:07:53] down through the ages and so
[1:07:55] we're not trying to reverse it all here
[1:07:56] i'm not saying hey y'all just meet me in
[1:07:57] the woods next sunday
[1:07:58] and we'll forget this church and sell it
[1:08:00] we're not trying to do that
[1:08:01] we we we live in 2020 about to be 2021.
[1:08:05] so you know i i just want to say in
[1:08:07] whatever the way
[1:08:08] the devil has stacked it against us how
[1:08:10] about we prove him wrong and go in a
[1:08:11] rapture
[1:08:13] what do you say friends what do we say
[1:08:16] what do you say we're just proving wrong
[1:08:18] and and have a mount zion showdown
[1:08:21] that's what mount zion's showdown means
[1:08:22] it's who's going in the rapture
[1:08:25] oh i want to raise both of my hands and
[1:08:26] say i am
[1:08:28] how do you know how how do you know the
[1:08:30] rapture might come
[1:08:32] without you without you the rapture
[1:08:34] can't go without me because i am the
[1:08:36] rapture
[1:08:37] i'm part of the rapture see
[1:08:41] so so we find that he says to them
[1:08:45] you're different you pharisees you're
[1:08:48] different
[1:08:49] from me my word you're identified
[1:08:52] i know you're abraham's children in that
[1:08:55] way you're just like all the other jews
[1:08:57] you are like abraham in that way
[1:08:59] but you're different than abraham was on
[1:09:03] the inside because abraham rejoiced to
[1:09:05] see my day and you're trying to
[1:09:06] assassinate me yes that's right
[1:09:08] why does my why can you not understand
[1:09:11] my speech
[1:09:12] why are my words strange to you see it
[1:09:15] says because
[1:09:16] yeah i know listen if you kept on going
[1:09:18] here after he's confessed that they're
[1:09:19] abraham's children
[1:09:20] and it won't take him very long just
[1:09:22] keep on reading down he'll say here's
[1:09:24] what it is
[1:09:25] i was a little polite back there but i'm
[1:09:26] going to put it on brass tacks you're of
[1:09:28] your father the devil
[1:09:31] so let's just know holds barred you're
[1:09:32] of your father the devil
[1:09:34] done that's what's wrong that's why you
[1:09:36] won't hear me
[1:09:39] all right so he says here in hebrews 12
[1:09:42] 16 to 17
[1:09:44] lest there be any fornicator now he's
[1:09:46] got to start preaching this way in the
[1:09:47] church because they're starting to get
[1:09:48] infiltrated
[1:09:50] with people who aren't really getting
[1:09:51] the new birth or profane person as esau
[1:09:54] who for one morsel of bread sold his
[1:09:56] birthright
[1:09:58] see esau was a blood brother but he
[1:10:01] but but he was different in
[1:10:04] from jacob in the he was different in a
[1:10:07] lot of ways
[1:10:09] he was but what got him was he was
[1:10:11] different in the most important way
[1:10:14] in every other way besides the most
[1:10:17] important way he was a better person
[1:10:19] than jacob
[1:10:20] amen if you put him on a report card he
[1:10:23] got
[1:10:23] all a's jacob literally got all f's
[1:10:26] right amen amen but
[1:10:30] jacob graduated esau didn't
[1:10:33] what gives because jacob had one thing
[1:10:36] that was his saving grace he wanted that
[1:10:38] birthright
[1:10:39] there was something in him that he
[1:10:41] probably couldn't even explain to
[1:10:42] himself
[1:10:43] hook or crook or however he has to get
[1:10:45] it he's going to get that birthright
[1:10:47] amen and so watch
[1:10:51] for you know verse 17 for you know how
[1:10:55] that afterward this is esau when he
[1:10:58] would have he would have
[1:11:00] inherited the blessing he was rejected
[1:11:03] for he found no place of repentance
[1:11:07] though he sought it carefully with
[1:11:10] tears
[1:11:14] so you can see that paul is trying to
[1:11:16] get the church to
[1:11:18] to to you know to wake up and realize
[1:11:20] that
[1:11:21] you know you can't make yourself
[1:11:23] anything
[1:11:24] the only the grace of god can do
[1:11:27] anything for you
[1:11:28] and so whatever you do when the grace
[1:11:31] comes
[1:11:32] don't reject it because you can't fix it
[1:11:36] if you do
[1:11:37] you can't get yourself to heaven you
[1:11:40] can't save yourself
[1:11:41] you're going to die unless god gives you
[1:11:44] grace
[1:11:45] so when he does take it
[1:11:50] pass it and you're finished
[1:11:53] see look at this other comparison just
[1:11:56] showing you stark differences revelation
[1:11:58] chapter 20
[1:12:01] verse 11-13 and i saw a great white
[1:12:04] throne
[1:12:07] and him that sat on it from whose face
[1:12:10] the earth and the heaven fled away look
[1:12:13] at these words
[1:12:14] and there was found no place for them
[1:12:17] and i saw the dead small and great stand
[1:12:20] before god
[1:12:22] and the books were opened and another
[1:12:25] book was opened
[1:12:26] which is the book of life and the dead
[1:12:28] were judged
[1:12:30] out of those things which were written
[1:12:31] in the books according to their works
[1:12:36] i'm often reminding people that no one
[1:12:39] has ever fully died yet
[1:12:41] amen and the war men have been
[1:12:44] laying down and going back to the dust
[1:12:46] of the earth from where they came for
[1:12:48] multiple millennia and it's a common
[1:12:51] thing to hear somebody saying
[1:12:53] oh he he died you know she died and i'm
[1:12:56] always
[1:12:56] if i get the opportunity to say well
[1:12:58] actually no one's ever died yet
[1:13:00] they're only held they they died as far
[1:13:04] as it relates to their human body
[1:13:06] but the person who lived inside that
[1:13:07] body still very much alive
[1:13:09] and their and say well where are they
[1:13:13] well they're only in one of two places
[1:13:14] either they're in a paradise of god or
[1:13:17] they're in a
[1:13:18] a jail cell bound over for trial right
[1:13:21] amen
[1:13:22] and some of them been bound over trial a
[1:13:24] long time you can't pay bail and get out
[1:13:25] of that
[1:13:27] and so we find that that they come up
[1:13:30] still very much alive and have to face
[1:13:33] the judge
[1:13:34] and they're judged out of the book
[1:13:37] according to the books
[1:13:38] according to their works verse 13.
[1:13:41] and the sea gave up the dead which were
[1:13:44] in it
[1:13:45] and death and hell delivered up the dead
[1:13:48] which were in them and they were judged
[1:13:51] every man
[1:13:52] according to their works now
[1:13:56] really focus your attention on me
[1:13:57] everybody look this way and just give me
[1:13:59] your attention
[1:14:00] listen the reason and i wasn't going to
[1:14:03] do this but i'm just feeling so
[1:14:05] pressed on by the holy spirit and i've
[1:14:08] been
[1:14:08] had a lot of conversation with the lord
[1:14:10] about this sermon lord what's the
[1:14:12] real kernel it's like i've got a lot of
[1:14:14] stuff here to say but
[1:14:16] what's what is it you're doing what's
[1:14:18] your motive
[1:14:20] what is it what's the objective of this
[1:14:22] sermon and that's just how it came to me
[1:14:24] i get those kind ever so often
[1:14:26] and i i want you to know that
[1:14:30] one of the reasons that i would read
[1:14:33] this dire oh this is a this could come
[1:14:37] out of a
[1:14:37] a horror story people are being judged
[1:14:40] and they're about to be sentenced and
[1:14:42] destroyed
[1:14:43] and it's so final my goodness
[1:14:46] the sea gives up the dead and the dead
[1:14:48] both small and great doesn't matter who
[1:14:49] they are they're
[1:14:50] they're standing there and the books are
[1:14:52] open and what uh what uh what a to do
[1:14:55] i mean this is big it's so big that
[1:14:58] that that it's a great white throne and
[1:15:01] and the
[1:15:02] face of the earth it's so large the face
[1:15:05] of the earth and the heavens fled away
[1:15:07] and there's even found no place for them
[1:15:09] that's how imposing this scene is
[1:15:12] amen and all the dead both
[1:15:16] small and great who have ever lived in
[1:15:19] the earth by the trillions
[1:15:20] yes amen amen stood before him
[1:15:24] and the book was opened and the books
[1:15:26] were opened
[1:15:28] and the judgment began and
[1:15:31] i i i think that the holy spirit is
[1:15:35] on this one and other ones that i'm
[1:15:37] going to read for you
[1:15:38] is to is to combat
[1:15:42] the how would i describe the age we live
[1:15:45] in today
[1:15:46] it's it's it's delusional yeah it's
[1:15:50] it's it's blase it's
[1:15:53] it's uh it's ambivalent to
[1:15:56] to all of this it doesn't even believe
[1:15:58] this is going to happen
[1:16:00] you can see that they they some
[1:16:02] celebrity
[1:16:03] who gave his or her life to stripping
[1:16:07] their clothes off and enticing
[1:16:09] men and women and dancing and vulgar and
[1:16:11] booze and drugs and sex and
[1:16:13] out in the open and decrying everything
[1:16:15] and then when they die
[1:16:16] they hold a big rally and everybody gets
[1:16:19] an up on a pulpit like i'm in
[1:16:21] and says i know he's looking down right
[1:16:23] now
[1:16:26] he's not i know she's up there smiling
[1:16:30] everybody wants to believe that right
[1:16:32] and i'm not here to dig it in
[1:16:35] that breaks my heart to see that kind of
[1:16:37] thing
[1:16:38] and to say oh i know i know you know
[1:16:41] oh she's in a better place you know
[1:16:44] you're in a better place
[1:16:45] no no no amen how do you know because i
[1:16:49] read the story
[1:16:50] that they were drunk off their feet and
[1:16:53] went to sleep and never woke up
[1:16:56] amen are they they died in a fiery crash
[1:17:01] drinking drugging sexing i'm sorry
[1:17:05] you don't get to go to heaven doing that
[1:17:11] and while i'm not glad to see anyone
[1:17:13] perish that way
[1:17:15] i'm very glad i get to go somewhere
[1:17:17] where that's not going to exist
[1:17:21] oh man i'm so glad i'm going to a land
[1:17:24] where
[1:17:25] nobody's going to roll up on me with
[1:17:27] music so loud and
[1:17:28] grate my nerves i'm not going to have to
[1:17:30] see
[1:17:31] nudity on the streets i'm not going to
[1:17:33] have to hear profanity
[1:17:34] i'm not going to have to see the madness
[1:17:36] of politics and the whole world
[1:17:38] lying to each other and to themselves oh
[1:17:42] here we have no continuing city but we
[1:17:45] seek one to come
[1:17:49] and for people who live that way they
[1:17:52] have no place at our altar
[1:17:55] it's not me being cruel me being you
[1:17:58] know
[1:17:58] uh uppity it's not me being selective
[1:18:00] it's not me that made the choice
[1:18:04] i did the man the person isn't the one
[1:18:06] that comes predestinated it's the seed
[1:18:08] of god in me
[1:18:09] see and so it's the oh there's only one
[1:18:12] elected son
[1:18:14] and that's christ and i'm in him so
[1:18:17] don't be angry at me i'm
[1:18:18] i'm in that gene pool i'm in that
[1:18:21] lineage i came from that
[1:18:23] see and so so we find that
[1:18:29] that we look at at this terrible scene
[1:18:33] and they every man judge accordions
[1:18:34] works revelation 20 and 6 blessed and
[1:18:36] holy
[1:18:38] is he that hath part in the first
[1:18:42] resurrection
[1:18:43] hallelujah i love this on such
[1:18:46] on such the second death hath no power
[1:18:50] but they shall be priest of god and of
[1:18:52] christ and shall reign with him
[1:18:54] a thousand years if everybody was going
[1:18:56] to be that there's little need to put it
[1:18:58] in the bible
[1:18:59] amen you understand there's little need
[1:19:02] to make a differentiation
[1:19:04] it's it's in the bible like it is
[1:19:05] because not everybody's going to be that
[1:19:07] but
[1:19:08] whoever can believe whoever can receive
[1:19:10] whoever can surrender
[1:19:12] you can have you can be kings and
[1:19:14] priests to god
[1:19:16] and of christ and reign a thousand years
[1:19:18] and the second death won't have any
[1:19:20] power on you
[1:19:23] imagine being able to be at the great
[1:19:25] white throne judgment and you're the
[1:19:27] you're part of a of a of a of a
[1:19:30] small sliver of humanity who's not the
[1:19:33] least bit afraid
[1:19:34] amen amen you're at the
[1:19:38] you're at the great white throne
[1:19:40] judgment and you don't have
[1:19:42] any anxiety any stress
[1:19:45] any worries there's nothing to think
[1:19:48] about
[1:19:48] other than just take your seat
[1:19:57] so there is a place
[1:20:00] and a food that paul is saying that we
[1:20:03] have
[1:20:04] a right to that no other no one else has
[1:20:07] a right to
[1:20:08] and it's not that god you know it's not
[1:20:10] that we won the lottery and they didn't
[1:20:12] it's not about that it's about the
[1:20:13] choices people make
[1:20:15] people choose the path you are the sum
[1:20:19] of the choices that you have made
[1:20:22] [Music]
[1:20:23] i remember conversations with my brother
[1:20:26] and i'm not going to speak evil over the
[1:20:27] dead but he's my brother and i can use
[1:20:28] him for an example he would say amen
[1:20:30] today preach it jay yeah
[1:20:32] you know one time he comes to me and his
[1:20:34] life is blown to smithereens
[1:20:36] and he comes to me and he says you know
[1:20:38] god loves you more than he does me and
[1:20:40] he really believed that he really
[1:20:41] believed god had it in for him
[1:20:42] and that god favored me over him and i
[1:20:45] said well that's stupid
[1:20:46] yeah he said well how can you say that
[1:20:49] look at your life and look at mine i
[1:20:50] said hey buddy
[1:20:51] let me tell you something we put our
[1:20:53] feet under the same supper table
[1:20:55] yes we slept in the same bed we had the
[1:20:58] same mom and dad
[1:20:59] we went to the same church we had the
[1:21:00] same preachers yeah
[1:21:02] right you you you were you're 15 i was
[1:21:06] 15.
[1:21:06] you're 19 i was 19. you're 25 i was 25.
[1:21:10] i said the difference in you and me nate
[1:21:12] is that at every single one of those
[1:21:14] junctures i was making a different
[1:21:16] choice than you
[1:21:18] yeah amen amen and you know what
[1:21:21] he humbled down and got it he said
[1:21:23] you're right
[1:21:24] you know i i deserved i've i've made my
[1:21:27] life what it is
[1:21:28] and there wasn't much left of it you
[1:21:30] know but it wasn't because
[1:21:32] he didn't have an example set in front
[1:21:34] of him it wasn't because he didn't have
[1:21:36] godly parents it wasn't because god
[1:21:38] hadn't sent him a message
[1:21:39] he had made the wrong choices god
[1:21:42] rich in mercy saved him or he wouldn't
[1:21:44] have been saved
[1:21:46] because he had mothers and a dad who
[1:21:48] went to his grave
[1:21:49] praying for his son he's got brothers
[1:21:51] got a church i'm here to tell you
[1:21:53] something friend god
[1:21:54] rich in mercy hallelujah
[1:21:59] but let's not fool ourselves god's not
[1:22:01] out to get you
[1:22:03] god's out to help you if you will allow
[1:22:06] him to
[1:22:07] amen amen but you might not
[1:22:13] so there's a place there's a table
[1:22:16] spread
[1:22:18] and david said he prepares a table
[1:22:22] in the presence of my enemies if that
[1:22:24] doesn't show distinction i don't know
[1:22:26] what does
[1:22:27] there's a table where david is sitting
[1:22:28] and it's full of food and there's a
[1:22:30] table
[1:22:30] of his enemies and they're not eating
[1:22:33] they're not welcome
[1:22:34] at that table who said did david build
[1:22:36] the table did david put it food no
[1:22:38] david said god did this god prepared a
[1:22:41] table for me
[1:22:42] right in the presence of my enemies
[1:22:45] [Music]
[1:22:46] there are tables where the ungodly eat
[1:22:49] that i have no place to eat
[1:22:52] there are tables of ungodliness that you
[1:22:55] have no place to eat
[1:22:57] so why should you be found there eating
[1:22:59] amen
[1:23:01] ask yourself a question deeply today i
[1:23:04] i was talking to one of the ministering
[1:23:06] brethren and telling
[1:23:08] i you know i'm not here today preaching
[1:23:10] a youth service i'm preaching to
[1:23:11] everybody
[1:23:12] but i have the young people in my heart
[1:23:14] so heavy when i was
[1:23:16] because they're still at the onset of
[1:23:18] life they
[1:23:19] they're still they still can make really
[1:23:21] good choices to have better results than
[1:23:23] i did or some of the older ones did
[1:23:25] and some of the older ones can say to
[1:23:26] these some of these young ones listen i
[1:23:28] i went down that trail all it did was
[1:23:30] get me beaten banged up and i regret it
[1:23:32] i wish i'd went down this trail
[1:23:33] [Music]
[1:23:36] amen so you know the
[1:23:39] the world has gotten to such a s a place
[1:23:43] to where righteousness and holiness and
[1:23:46] godliness and christianity
[1:23:48] it means so little i'm here today
[1:23:50] preaching to reestablish the ancient
[1:23:52] landmarks
[1:23:54] that there are lines of demarcation
[1:23:56] there are very
[1:23:58] there are there are greatly opposite
[1:24:01] god has a greatly different idea
[1:24:04] about what holiness is than the devil
[1:24:07] does
[1:24:09] and therefore when i if i'm going to
[1:24:11] preach this
[1:24:13] accurately and in truth in spirit and in
[1:24:16] truth
[1:24:16] then i'm i'm not going to be able to
[1:24:19] avoid
[1:24:20] sounding caustic and different than
[1:24:24] 99.99 of other christian pulpits
[1:24:28] in the world see
[1:24:32] but we have to establish and break back
[1:24:35] i have today i feel like i need to fight
[1:24:37] back
[1:24:38] to say hold on god is not some sloppy
[1:24:41] half gold christian half-baked christian
[1:24:44] you're a real rugged christian or you're
[1:24:46] not
[1:24:47] a christian and you have to take a stand
[1:24:50] i'm not here to wallow around with the
[1:24:51] world and eat at their tables
[1:24:53] their tables are full of vomit what are
[1:24:55] you doing eating there
[1:25:01] say it doesn't make a difference it does
[1:25:03] make a difference
[1:25:07] you know i i was coming to the church
[1:25:10] this morning and
[1:25:11] we're passing by that beautiful new
[1:25:13] building
[1:25:14] there on sands point road gorgeous
[1:25:18] oh thing it's beautiful my heart
[1:25:20] flutters every time i go by
[1:25:21] i've got a plan with trustees i said you
[1:25:23] know we could we could plagiarize we
[1:25:24] could duplicate
[1:25:26] that and make this one look just like
[1:25:28] that one and
[1:25:29] we might even try to do something like
[1:25:30] that anyway let me not get off on that
[1:25:33] it's a beautiful church but you know
[1:25:34] what what i noticed and now can i say
[1:25:36] something
[1:25:37] that's going to sound critical but i'm
[1:25:38] not being critical
[1:25:41] we take more for it because when i drove
[1:25:44] by
[1:25:44] i didn't feel critical but i noticed
[1:25:48] that as they're coming people are
[1:25:50] getting out of their cars
[1:25:52] very fine looking beautiful people you
[1:25:55] can tell they're not
[1:25:56] in their work duds men are in suits
[1:25:59] women are in nice dresses
[1:26:01] and but i noticed that all the women are
[1:26:03] wearing the modern
[1:26:04] you know half thigh dress yeah that's
[1:26:07] like five inches above their knees
[1:26:10] and i thought to myself i thought about
[1:26:12] the difference i thought about this
[1:26:14] you know they're gonna go into that
[1:26:17] church
[1:26:18] and the whole attitude from the pulpit
[1:26:21] to the janitor
[1:26:22] is going to be what a lovely dress how
[1:26:25] nice you look today
[1:26:27] and then there's i guarantee you there's
[1:26:29] also going to be some unholy
[1:26:31] ghost-filled men going how nice you look
[1:26:33] today
[1:26:34] take my word for it a man without the
[1:26:37] holy ghost is just a brute
[1:26:40] he's just a brute beast that's the
[1:26:42] scripture that's peter's words
[1:26:44] someone without the holy ghost is a
[1:26:47] brute animal
[1:26:49] you were too until you got born again
[1:26:51] you're just a human animal
[1:26:53] yeah you understand and you'll go by
[1:26:54] your instincts and brother branham even
[1:26:56] talks about you know don't fault them
[1:26:59] you see the man with his booze or his
[1:27:00] cigarettes he said
[1:27:02] you know he don't know he he's not
[1:27:03] converted don't don't condemn him try to
[1:27:06] help him try to get him to change
[1:27:08] he said if he don't change that's the
[1:27:10] only joy he's ever going to have don't
[1:27:11] even take it from him
[1:27:14] amen i mean it's not my job to go stand
[1:27:18] on the street corner and tell everybody
[1:27:19] they're going to hell
[1:27:21] odds are a lot of them are yeah but
[1:27:24] but my job isn't to isn't to try to
[1:27:26] crush somebody
[1:27:27] i don't even want to force you into
[1:27:29] holiness by beating
[1:27:30] brow beating you from this bullpen i
[1:27:32] don't want this to be a bully pulpit
[1:27:34] our deacons aren't interested in making
[1:27:36] this a police state
[1:27:38] you understand but but isn't it isn't it
[1:27:40] a contrast
[1:27:41] that that that they would go those
[1:27:44] ladies
[1:27:45] not speaking against them they're just
[1:27:47] under misinterpreted theology some
[1:27:49] fake preacher told him it was okay i
[1:27:51] feel sorry for them
[1:27:53] right and brother branham prophesied
[1:27:55] about that fake preacher said he'll
[1:27:57] suffer for that in the regions beyond
[1:27:59] telling those women it didn't matter
[1:28:01] when it does
[1:28:04] so i'm not his judge that's what a
[1:28:06] prophet said they said oh he's not a
[1:28:07] prophet i said you better hope he's not
[1:28:09] because if he is you're finished
[1:28:13] so i get you hoping he's not i get that
[1:28:17] but i thought about the contrast i
[1:28:19] thought here is women
[1:28:21] walking into a church with
[1:28:24] mid-thigh dresses on that are thought
[1:28:28] pretty and you sisters
[1:28:31] get harassed from the pulpit if even
[1:28:34] your knees are showing yeah
[1:28:36] amen you get scolded
[1:28:39] yeah rightly so all right
[1:28:42] try that again man rightly so
[1:28:48] you get scolded if even your knees are
[1:28:50] showing yeah
[1:28:51] right amen and if you were to come in
[1:28:55] in one of those kind of dresses we have
[1:28:58] actually and we know that you know
[1:29:00] better visitors we have the deacons have
[1:29:02] a little bit of
[1:29:03] grace for but if it's somebody that they
[1:29:05] know
[1:29:06] knows better and does it anyway
[1:29:09] listen we have sent women home
[1:29:12] amen we've asked them to leave
[1:29:16] and go home and put on some clothes you
[1:29:19] know what a beautiful thing we did that
[1:29:20] to one young lady
[1:29:21] she did she didn't fight cuss jump up
[1:29:24] and down she just went home put on
[1:29:25] longer skirt and came back to church
[1:29:26] came
[1:29:27] back to church praise the lord
[1:29:30] i believe that you know and and still
[1:29:33] love that young woman
[1:29:35] but listen listen they're not everybody
[1:29:38] that's been at bethel tabernacle stayed
[1:29:40] here we've lost young people to the
[1:29:41] world we've lost middle aged people to
[1:29:42] the world
[1:29:43] we've seen marriages break up we've seen
[1:29:44] people go back on god
[1:29:46] amen understand uh but but
[1:29:49] but what i what i feel in my in my heart
[1:29:52] the holy spirit is trying to get you to
[1:29:53] understand
[1:29:54] listen the world may not me
[1:29:57] the world has watered down
[1:30:01] holiness they have watered down
[1:30:04] righteousness
[1:30:05] they've watered it down to where they i
[1:30:08] literally i was listening to a podcast a
[1:30:10] conservative
[1:30:11] talk show guy i kind of like him a
[1:30:13] little bit but boy i'm going to have to
[1:30:14] write him a letter
[1:30:15] and he's he's on the air saying you know
[1:30:18] i love my blessed lord jesus christ
[1:30:20] and he's got all the right lingo and he
[1:30:22] means it i'm not saying he's being
[1:30:23] insincere
[1:30:24] he says i love the lord jesus he's my
[1:30:26] lord and savior and within the next
[1:30:28] the next half sentence here comes swear
[1:30:30] words d this and s
[1:30:31] that and i didn't even know he would do
[1:30:33] that on the podcast
[1:30:34] i'm about to write him a letter and say
[1:30:36] so who

[1:30:41] let me help you you're not
[1:30:45] and i like you and i don't want to see
[1:30:48] you go to hell
[1:30:49] or stay in a tribulation because some
[1:30:53] some poor excuse for a servant of god
[1:30:56] told you that that's okay that's part of
[1:30:59] the blindness
[1:31:00] of laodicea that's what happened
[1:31:04] when the two messengers went to sodom
[1:31:06] they they blinded the people
[1:31:09] and the you know billy graham and oral
[1:31:11] roberts
[1:31:12] so you've got the you've got the
[1:31:14] evangelicals teaching the world that
[1:31:16] all you got to do is say i received
[1:31:17] jesus christ my savior and your
[1:31:19] you're you're headed for heaven it
[1:31:21] doesn't matter how you live at all
[1:31:22] and then you've got the pentecostals
[1:31:24] saying you know
[1:31:26] wealth is spirituality and if you're the
[1:31:28] richer you are you must be a real
[1:31:30] christian
[1:31:32] and that's then the world has taken it
[1:31:34] hook line and sinker
[1:31:36] and they believe it and so everybody's a
[1:31:39] christian now and i've ran into that but
[1:31:40] i'm
[1:31:41] i i think that when we look into the
[1:31:43] word of god
[1:31:44] we have to i want to say to you young
[1:31:46] people that's not true
[1:31:49] that's not the gospel right and i i if
[1:31:52] that sounds
[1:31:53] hard i'm here to tell you i'm saying it
[1:31:55] out of love
[1:31:56] listen i mean if if if you come you know
[1:31:59] if if you come
[1:32:01] here's what i would say to you today
[1:32:03] here let me just put it to you like
[1:32:04] jesus did
[1:32:05] when when the 70 left him
[1:32:08] and they just couldn't stand his
[1:32:10] preaching anymore
[1:32:12] they sure love those fishes and loaves
[1:32:16] amen man they sure love seeing those
[1:32:18] miracles and getting their sick healed
[1:32:19] and their dead raised
[1:32:21] but boy when it came to their lives now
[1:32:23] they didn't like that
[1:32:25] and they just said you know we're done
[1:32:28] we can't handle us anymore
[1:32:29] we're going away and jesus turns to his
[1:32:31] disciples
[1:32:33] why don't you go with them i mean
[1:32:37] i i i could stand up here today dislike
[1:32:39] the lord
[1:32:40] and say you you you sisters
[1:32:44] you wear a skirt too short and i harass
[1:32:47] you over it
[1:32:47] or scold you from the pulpit why do you
[1:32:50] put up with it
[1:32:52] why do you stay here why do you let me
[1:32:54] talk to you like that
[1:32:58] you come in men men too men got plenty
[1:33:00] of hang-ups and problems
[1:33:02] all kinds of carnality and chasing
[1:33:03] things of the world
[1:33:05] and and and and young people and parents
[1:33:08] don't have enough consideration to put
[1:33:10] to put their lives on hold while they
[1:33:13] get these kids raised and trained up in
[1:33:15] the admonition of god instead
[1:33:17] living their lives at 500 miles an hour
[1:33:19] while their kids blow in the wind and
[1:33:20] let's hope they
[1:33:21] let's hope they land okay amen
[1:33:24] you understand this is satan's eden
[1:33:27] do you understand there's never been an
[1:33:29] evil day like this before
[1:33:32] do you understand that god didn't put
[1:33:34] you to end
[1:33:35] to as their parent to be their buddy he
[1:33:38] put you there to be their trainer
[1:33:40] amen amen
[1:33:43] so okay why do you put up with it
[1:33:47] why don't you get up and walk out
[1:33:49] because i can promise you
[1:33:51] if you wear those kind of things i'm
[1:33:53] always going to go after it if i see
[1:33:54] parents like that
[1:33:55] i'm always church will not be a fun
[1:33:58] place for you if that's how you're
[1:34:01] determined to live
[1:34:02] why do you do it why do you stay here
[1:34:05] why do you put up with it
[1:34:07] i'll just say you tell you in the words
[1:34:09] of jesus will you go also
[1:34:11] those people over there that church
[1:34:13] would never come in here
[1:34:15] i i wouldn't last five minutes in that
[1:34:17] pulpit preaching like this they'd throw
[1:34:18] me out immediately
[1:34:21] so what's wrong with you people y'all
[1:34:22] crazy or something
[1:34:24] why do you put up with this kind of a
[1:34:25] preacher why do you put up with this
[1:34:26] kind of i'm going to tell you why
[1:34:28] because you got the same feeling peter
[1:34:29] had
[1:34:30] where where else would we go you have
[1:34:32] the words of eternal life
[1:34:34] and i'm weak but he's strong and i know
[1:34:36] i've got problems
[1:34:38] but i know i don't want to have him i
[1:34:40] know he's holy and i know i want to be
[1:34:41] like him
[1:34:42] so brother jason just preach it and just
[1:34:45] preach it and just preach it
[1:34:47] i'm going to tell you something friends
[1:34:48] i know i i occasionally get a hate mail
[1:34:50] or hate text for preaching like that
[1:34:52] but you know what i overwhelmingly get
[1:34:54] when i go down and preaching like that
[1:34:56] i get more texts and emails from you and
[1:34:58] from out there and saying brothers thank
[1:35:00] you
[1:35:01] thank you keep preaching it don't ever
[1:35:03] stop preaching it
[1:35:04] we need to know the truth we need to
[1:35:06] know god makes a difference
[1:35:10] the world with all of their watered down
[1:35:12] opinions i'm here to tell you
[1:35:14] they have no place at this table they
[1:35:16] have no place at this altar
[1:35:18] they've made up their mind i pray for
[1:35:20] them i try to witness them i try to live
[1:35:22] it
[1:35:22] i i try to live this life in front of
[1:35:25] them not a compromised version
[1:35:27] of my life plus their life so i don't
[1:35:29] offend them
[1:35:31] what value is not offending them
[1:35:35] where's the value in that friends you
[1:35:37] think jesus said
[1:35:39] i really need to say this but it'll hurt
[1:35:40] your feelings i'm just not going to say
[1:35:41] it
[1:35:42] all right come here let me let me
[1:35:43] multiply some more fish for you here you
[1:35:44] go
[1:35:45] you know god loves you carry on in your
[1:35:47] sin
[1:35:49] no he looked him right in the eye and
[1:35:51] told him what their problem was
[1:35:54] paul didn't pull any punches peter
[1:35:55] pulled any punches john didn't pull any
[1:35:56] punches
[1:35:59] the the messengers irenaeus didn't pull
[1:36:00] any punches
[1:36:02] they come without watered-down nonsense
[1:36:04] sarinas
[1:36:05] he called him the sons of satan
[1:36:06] published it put it in a letter and sent
[1:36:08] it around the world amen
[1:36:11] he didn't pull any breath why brother
[1:36:12] brown chose him he said he's real
[1:36:14] militant
[1:36:15] and brother branham chose every
[1:36:17] messenger based on
[1:36:19] how similar he was to saint paul amen
[1:36:22] and they they criticized paul those
[1:36:25] hypocrite preachers criticized him for
[1:36:27] how hard he was in his in his preaching
[1:36:28] in his letters
[1:36:30] and then they you know it's like oh my
[1:36:33] goodness
[1:36:34] the political carnival that we have
[1:36:36] going on today and
[1:36:38] one side blames the other side for
[1:36:39] exactly what they would have done had
[1:36:40] they been in the same
[1:36:41] position and this side denies this and
[1:36:44] they deny that they all know they all do
[1:36:46] it they're all guilty
[1:36:48] and and i'm going to tell you something
[1:36:49] friends the antichrist has ma
[1:36:52] has managed to give you an illusion of
[1:36:54] two systems there's only one system it's
[1:36:56] babylonian
[1:36:58] it's it's it's a purple curtain and it's
[1:37:00] in control of both sides
[1:37:02] don't be fooled you have an illusion of
[1:37:05] choice
[1:37:06] the the the prophecy is what's
[1:37:08] determining things
[1:37:10] i'm just so glad that i made one choice
[1:37:15] and i i don't i'm not gonna change my
[1:37:18] vote
[1:37:19] for nothing
[1:37:22] brother branham says and i gotta wind it

[1:37:28] forget
[1:37:30] give me 10 minutes and that'll put me
[1:37:33] right at about an
[1:37:34] hour marriage of the lamb 1962
[1:37:39] so many says if the lord will just take
[1:37:42] this evil spirit from me from drinking
[1:37:44] or from gambling or from lying or
[1:37:45] stealing i'll serve him

[1:37:56] things

[1:38:10] because that is so powerful
[1:38:12] that you that i'm so glad i'm not having
[1:38:15] to say it because then you could kind of
[1:38:17] doubt it yeah brother jason

[1:39:14] it down
[1:39:14] you have power to do it but you must be
[1:39:17] willing to lay it down

[1:40:02] at the you it just so happens
[1:40:06] that in the providence of god and in the

[1:40:25] transition

[1:40:28] is laying down lines of clear
[1:40:30] demarcation
[1:40:31] you are not them and they are not you
[1:40:34] and that is not this and this
[1:40:36] is not that and i don't care what the
[1:40:38] world what hollywood has to say
[1:40:40] what what smiley preachers who have 30
[1:40:42] 000 people have to say
[1:40:44] i don't care uh what those two angels
[1:40:46] had to say they didn't preach to abraham
[1:40:48] they preached a lot
[1:40:50] i'm not here to believe that kind of of
[1:40:53] short
[1:40:53] coming up short of just saying i'm a

[1:42:08] this is a a death-defying hour that
[1:42:12] we've arrived at amen
[1:42:15] and i think that we need to establish
[1:42:19] that
[1:42:20] we are different not because we wanted
[1:42:22] to be because god made us different
[1:42:25] i think that we have a obligation to
[1:42:28] demonstrate to the world
[1:42:30] that there is a difference
[1:42:34] you know when i say will you go away
[1:42:38] also
[1:42:38] listen some have
[1:42:44] some have
[1:42:47] we've got people today that i dedicated
[1:42:50] as babies who are no longer
[1:42:51] serving god you know why they made a
[1:42:54] choice
[1:42:56] you got to make a choice some of you
[1:42:58] might be here hearing me today
[1:43:00] and you might make the same choice to
[1:43:02] say you know i just want the world and
[1:43:04] i'm just going to leave and you might do
[1:43:05] that
[1:43:06] but i'm here to tell you something that
[1:43:07] ain't going to stop me praying for you
[1:43:10] that ain't going to stop parents praying
