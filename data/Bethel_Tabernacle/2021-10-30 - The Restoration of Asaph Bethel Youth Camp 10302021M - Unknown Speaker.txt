========================================

has cruel markings and scourgings yay moreover bonds and imprisonment he like what that i thought hebrews 11 is the faith chapter that's exactly right it is but god let us know in the beginning what faith did to stop things but then he dropped it right down in the back and the end part he also let you know what faith can do while you're going through things the ones that were sought asunder cruel markings they had the same faith of the one that stopped the mouth of lion quenched the violence of fire see sometimes god stops faith can stop things but also faith can keep you while you're going through things so don't get discouraged when hard times come just keep pressing on amen you know brother branham said that the first doctrine jesus ever preached was you must be born again and when i heard him say that i said if that be truth which i believe it is i said uh i ought to be able to find that in genesis and i found that in genesis the birth the new birth is actually preached in genesis chapter one and uh and i always want to try to build my way up to something when and when we talk about earth we got to remember the prophet god said when god was creating the earth he also had your bodies in mind because that's why our bodies come from it comes from the dust of the ground and i began to look at in the book of genesis how that god did these things he had us in mind now in isaiah 45 it says for thus says the lord that created the heavens god himself that fallen to earth and made it he has established it he created it not in vain he found it to be inhabited now when i read that scripture i think of natural and spiritual because we are earth god created us will earth he did not create the earth in vain he created the earth so that it would be inhabited so when i read that scripture i said he did not create me in vain he created me to be inhabited inhabited by what him god want to live in us that's why jesus said me and the father we want to make our abode in you you look that word in a bold up it means permanent residence god want a house hello god don't want rental property he won't bought property that he purchased himself can we say man you know when you got a rental house with someone you get old enough get married get a house when you got a rental house uh you'll do things to it you'll paint it but i promise you because it's a rental house you're gonna get cheap paint you're gonna put cheap stuff in it because it's not yours you say well i'm just going to do a little something in it but i it ain't mine so why put my best in it amen but now when you buy your own you're going to want to put the best in that house that right you're gonna get the high grade paint and uh good material you want the best in the house can we say praise the lord but you ain't gonna do too much to a rental vessel but you wanna bought house to do whatever you wanna do in it and if that be the case god won't bought houses that he purchased himself that's why he want to invest things in it come and say praise the lord you see gifts and callings is without repentance people can have a lot of gifts and do a lot of things and wonderful things and still not make it to heaven can we say amen see judas is carried judas is carrying it was rental property balaam was rental property huh god used them but paul was bought property so god invested more and i'm here to tell you you are not rental property you've been practiced by the blood of jesus christ and god will invest everything inside of you amen he said he created the earth it was without form and darkness was upon the face of the deep there was no shape it was no form there was no order actually that's you and me when you came out of your mother's womb praise the lord that's right the same way he done the earth it's the same thing he'd done to you and me and then it said and darkness was upon the face of the deep you and i was born in darkness we was born in sin shaping iniquity we come in this world liar do you realize the very moment you come out of your mama's womb you was a little liar everything inside of you to do wrong was right there inside of you nobody had to teach you you know it's amazing nobody got to teach you how to do wrong it automatically comes because it's the nature that we was born with can we say praise the lord but you know god was not worried how the condition of the earth was looking at that time without form and in darkness that wasn't bothering god because god knew what lay beneath can we say amen god knew what was down there so god had to do some things that the things that was planted down there he wanted them to grow god said i need to do some things and what did he do amen the bible tells us in genesis darkness went upon the face of the deep and remember all of the seeds and things down the land they couldn't grow they needed that sunlight to come so they could grow but what did god do first the bible tells us even though it was looking in that type of situation but before anything could change the way god wanted the spirit of god had to move hey man the earth state would have stayed in that same kind of shape but when the spirit of god moved things started to happen the same thing with you and me you could come to church after service after service after service amen after service got the service but ain't nothing gonna happen to you in your life until the spirit of god come and move in your life then it begins to bring changes amen the same thing god did to the earth when the spirit of god moved when the spirit of god moved the bible tells us amen i'm sorry and then verse 3 said and god said let there be light see amen you can sit in service after service but when god's spirit began to move upon you the words now no longer just become words sermons just don't become servant they become light to you now you begin to be able to see amen praise the lord and then the beautiful thing about it he said let there be light and there was like now you're coming to church you're coming into service and it began to mean more to you and the thing that i love about the most in this scripture the bible said god saw the light that it was good and then god divided the light from the darkness that the same thing you'll be going through in patterns in your life when the spirit of god move upon you you come to church you're hearing the word the word becomes light and then the bible says he separate light from darkness you'll get to a place in your life you don't have to be rebuked huh there's a scripture in the bible amen something says i i get tired of coming to church getting rebuked getting corrected but there's a scripture in the bible where you can come to church and not get rebuked and the bible said that he that is spiritual judges himself amen when you judge yourself correct yourself and you're wrong when you come to church god won't rebuke you because you already took the word yourself and corrected yourself if you're tired of getting rebuked stop doing the wrong thing do the right thing then you won't get reviewed because judgment begins at the house of god praise the lord see the message is grace it's also judgment it spans everything redemption compassion judgment grace everything is in the message i don't try to pick one spot and stay on one spot what the message is i take it for exactly the way it is the way the prophet of god brought it he say things amen he say things and it'd be judgmental correction but all of it's out of love can we say man listen to this i want to read this mess from investment to me he gives a warning he says if you got something in your heart for god and you won't express it and so forth and just keep putting it off well later on later on you know keep putting it off he said that little desire you once had to serve god will be taken from you i didn't say that he said and i believe it praise the lord you know sometimes people say well the prophet said it they just want to throw it off of them no he said it and i'm saying what he said and i believe what he said he said the devil will come in and steal that away and then you won't have a desire to serve him so that's a warning when god dealing with your heart don't keep pushing it off pushing it off i'm going to get right into it i'm going to get right i'm going to get right no receiving right at that moment when he's dealing with you don't let the devil come and steal that from you he did so if you have the least desire not a big desire the least desire he said there must be something that he talking to these businessmen he said there must be something even brought you to this breakfast this morning there is something faith come by hearing hearing of the word and there must be some desire or you wouldn't even be here so i believe how many of you desire to be here that's god pulling on you he says in the mess of christ the mystery god revealed he said why do you hunger he the church why do you thirst he said it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of the world you let some pastor you let somebody else get that out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsting it's hung and hungry is god trying to reveal to you the revelation the last days is here see he laying things out where things can happen to try to pull things from you it can be family it can be friends it can be husband it can be wife when god trying to deal with you and distractions come but i believe brother and sister we need to do like we preached the other morning when the devil wanted to bring something to you tell him no deal can we say praise the lord all right in the message identification i really love this quote he said i'm sure tonight that we ought to find ourselves somewhere in some character of the bible so that we would know the outcome of that character and know what our outcome would be what that means when you're going through something find some character in the bible that's going through what you're going through see what their outcome is then you'll be able to see what your outcome will be praise the lord i read that quote right there because he said find the character so i want to deal with a character called asaph there's so many that we can deal with but i want to deal with him uh especially deal with him but to do that i want to paint you a picture about a self we read in psalm 73 about a self but let's go backwards to see who this man is are you with me first chronicles 6. let's go to verse 31 it said in these are they whom david set over the service of the song in the house of the lord after the ark had rested they ministered before the dwelling place of the tabernacle of the congregation with singing until solomon had built the house of the lord in jerusalem and they waited on their office according to their order verse 33 says and these are they that waited with their children of the sons of the carnage hermits and singers and the son of joel and the son of shemio notice saying they waited with their children so it's going to start naming one different ones that was able to even minister before the ark of the covenant and it's going to just bring it you're going to bring it down now drop with me to verse 38 i'm going to do a bunch of jumping but i want to paint a picture it said the sons of isaac the son of cohas the son of levi and the son of israel and his brother asaph now he's bringing asaph on the scene the one that we read in psalm 73 see i just stopped at the first verse just to mention asaph's name but i'm taking you back to show you the position that this man had a man in the economy of god and he said his brother asaph who stood on his right hand even asap the son of baraka shemia now let's turn to first chronicles 15. excuse me for going a little fast but be a limited time here first chronicles 15. it said david we're gonna go to verse one david made him houses in the city of david and prepared a place for the ark of god pitch for a tent and david said none ought to carry the ark of god but the levites for them that the lord chosen to carry the ark of god and to minister into it forever david gather all israel together to jerusalem to bring up the ark of the lord to his place which he had prepared for it now i want to jump down to verse 11. and david call for zadok a b athena the priest and the levites uriel aci joel shemia eliot and at minidad he said unto them you are the chief of the fathers of the levites sanctify yourself both you and your brethren i'm just reading these things uh you know now when we talk about the art of the covenant you have to understand that was extremely important to the children of israel the ark of the covenant represents the word the ark of the covenant represents christ so that's nothing likely to be played with it was serious to them amen praise the lord so now we're just setting up something verse 13. he said before because you did not at first the lord of god made a breach between us that we sought him not after the new order you remember when they brought the ark the levites then carried some innocent men lost their lives so david showing the importance of this ark you don't touch it anybody can't touch it you can't handle it any kind of way you got to respect it that's the same as christ you got you can't approach him any kind of way you got to respect him you got to reverence him you got to honor him you just can't come up with an attitude like cain hey man cain had an attitude take what i got and i'll leave it and the prophet god said god left it we can't bring god anything we got to approach him the right way amen let's go down to verse 16. david speaking to the chiefs of the levites to appoint their brother and to be singles with instruments of music plastering hearts and symbols sounding by lifting up the voice with joy notice he appointing people to be able to play in front of the ark that's a serious position even just playing music he putting them there think about the ones he put in there i don't think they just said well look at me he chose me what do you want me to do no i think they was thankful oh i got a position to play in front of the ark they was very humble at their approach to these things amen listen what he says verse 17 so the levites appointed hemium the son of joel and his brethren asaph he comes up again the son of baraka and the sons of maria their brother ethan the son of kushaya now notice it put he's showing who he appointed to amen to play in front of the ark a south now go to verse 19. so the singers haman asap and ethan were appointed to sound symbols with uh symbols of brass and showing their position how they was appointed amen just keep following when we're building a picture now go to chapter 16. verse one so they brought the uncle god set it in the midst of the tent with david had pitched for it and they offered birth sacrifices and peace offerings before god verse 4 and he appointed certain of the levites to minister before the ark of the lord and to record and to thank and praise the lord god of israel now notice verse 5 it said an asaph the chief so in other words when he first called in asaphenyl it was just asap asaph asaf but now he's calling asap the chief so now he's been elevated in his office to be chief amen that's important mean leader chief a leader the one to be in the forefront he placed a south there and then next to him zechariah jl shimmer martha and just skip on down and uh i want to just with plasterings and with hearts he said but asaph made a sound with symbols he's the chief now got to verse 7. he already remained asap the chief which is a very important position in rome now look what david does amen let's go down to verse seven this first chronicles 16 7. he said then on that day david delivered first this sum to thank the lord in the hands of asap and his brethren think about that king david don't wrote a song now he don't wrote the psalm now he's walking up to asap and finally put it in asap's hand how do you think asap fell i'm pretty sure he would like when david says hey self you're the chief i want to put the psalm in your hand amen i can see yourself thank you thank you david probably like some of you girls feel when the boy finally texts you oh he texts me and don't even know it's a trick behind it but asap get it in his hand for king david look at the importance get it straight from the king that's how we ought to feel about the message this message that we believe comes straight from the throne of god that's why we have to reverse it and be so thankful and be careful how we think about it amen follow with me go down to verse 37. so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the lord let me read that again so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the lord asaph and his brethren to minister before the ark continually as every day's work required other word asaph was a man that was constantly in the work of god in the things of god he was always there what a man can we say what a man what a position what a place to be placed in oh my my praise the lord amen let me just go read now turn to first chronicles 25. first chronicles 25 moreover david verse one more over david and the captains of the whole separated to the service of the sons of asaph and herman and judah who should prophesy with hearts with plasteries with symbols and the normal of workmen according to their service boss verse 2 of the sons of asaph he began to give their names he said then it says the sons of a self under the hands of a self which prophesied according to the order of the king so everything they keep showing you they was under a south asia had a very important role as a leader this is the asap we read in psalms 73. are you with me so far now let's go back to psalm 73 you get it say amen it starts out a psalm of asaph other words he wrote this he gonna one thing we're gonna find about asaph he we found he's a a very influential person in a position but we're gonna find some things about him that we wouldn't have known if he never wrote it are you with me it says a psalm of asaph he starts off truly god is good to israel even to such as our of a clean heart he's giving god praise showing how good god is are you with me now verse 2. he said but as for me my feet was almost gone my steps had well now slipped that's interesting there's a change he's saying otherwise i'm almost finished but what would make a man say something like this with such a position now talking about his feet is almost finished slip he's almost gone what would make a man say something like that listen what he says for i was envious at the foolish when i saw the prosperity of the wicked this man had everything planned before the ark of the covenant placed in a position but now his eyes don't change let me put it to you in plain words looking at the world what would you say about a man like that what's wrong with you you got such a position in the play and now you're gonna let the world shake you wouldn't you say that brother what's going on in your mind thinking like that what's wrong with asap that's what we would say about him with such a position they're gonna let the be envious at the wicked that's why i say about people amen when god don't call you into this message and you don't let something like the world pull you away from it you crazy we gonna lead you're gonna leave christ you're gonna need the word what is wrong people are losing their minds but asaph was letting the world looking at what the world had and didn't let it pull him all right let's keep reading verse four for there are no beings in their death but their strength is firm i want you to learn something about this scripture i'm sure you don't read it before but what you're gonna learn about this scripture well asaph because he's looking being envious of the wicked whenever you do things like that look at the world the next thing the devil will do in your life make you compare church with the world he'll put you in comparison mode this is what happened to asaph listen what he said now when he's when you see the word there there when he say there there he's speaking of the world then i think he's going to talk about dave he's going to speak of church people all right notice now he said there are no bears in their death but their strength is firm now they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other man now they and there he's speaking of the world but who is other man the other man is church people he comparing the world with church people are y'all with me this morning keep following with me he said verse 5 they are not in trouble as other man neither are they playing like other man you know what that devil he's something else he can have you sitting in church thinking you played i'm trapped i'm in bondage i can't do nothing i can't have fun i'm playing but look what the world is doing having a good time having fun but me plagued can't express myself can't be free played see when you get in that shape the devil becomes your minister and he talks and he's got some good sermons and all of his sermons is based upon reason that's exactly right you remember the prophet of god said reason he said that's how the devil was successful and getting eve he said he's also successful today with the same thing reasoning are you with me let's keep going on verse seven they all stand out with fatness they have more than heart wish he's breaking a comparison again oh they got everything in the world they got the entertainment everything to make you happy and so forth he just said they're just some happy people but look at us skip to verse 9 they set their mouths against the heavens their tongue walks through the earth he talks about how the world is have you ever seen the time of a generation people ain't afraid to curse god that's the time we're living in they got no fear no conscience of god they'll say anything amen i remember when i was a young man i didn't care nothing about god i knew i was a god but when i heard somebody say something bad about god something that shook me i said man don't say that don't say that but today people don't care one thing that people don't got no reverence for god no more thanks to hollywood to comedians and things like that making jokes about god to people that don't really care like look at god as he's a joke that's why they don't create it how many y'all ever heard of this man ain't steve harvey that's the biggest hypocrite i ever know but people love steve's probably some people in the message rather listen to steve counsel and listen to bible counsel pray hey lord see i'm painting you a dark picture but it changes it changes so i'm not going to leave you in the dark but i want to stay in the dark right now and see how bad this is what don't happen to this brother all right that's what i really want you to see part a self let's go to verse 11 and they say how does god know and is there knowledge in the most high mocking guard now verse 12. listen what he said behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they increase in riches do you see where this brother mind this air he got looking at the world too much until it started plaguing him he started desiring it wanting it amen but you know asap was the son of god yet all of this happening to him he was a son of god now just think about asap be in his position being over people but got all of this in his heart ain't telling nobody then somebody wants to come to asap for some counseling say asap can i talk to your morning he said yes yes yes you know i'm going through something asap and it's so hard in there then asap stands up no this is what you need to do you need to go do this right here and the lord's going to be with you asap just cancel them because being a chief people are going to come to him after he counsels them and talk to them when they leave the asap go what about me i was able to encourage them i was able to counsel them but look what i'm going through because nobody knew what he was going through but him and god and the devil you find yourself there to tell people truth cancel them and then when you look at yourself wow look at me look at me those things happen asap was now in a dark place but the beauty of it all when you get to those places of pressure the next thing the devil has to do to you is get you to forget all of the things god has already done for you he'll have to do that listen what asap says upon us so much pressure verse 13. listen what he said verily i cleanse my heart in vain and wash my hands in innocency let me give it to you in plain word the other words living clean what good has it done me has it what good has it done to me listen what he says now verse 14 for all the day long i've been playing and chasing every morning other words i'm living right i try to live right do the best that i can but all i got is nothing but problems here problems there and all nothing but problems so what good is it doing me to serve god and try to do right that's where he's at now but i'm here to tell you when you get that fall you need to let that devil know you're nothing but a liar god i have not been created in vain i've been created to be inhabited the same that is earth is inhabited god is going to live in me amen if i say i would speak dust behold i should have again i should have been against the generation of thy children otherwise if i tell people what's in my heart i'm going to offend them i'm just going to keep it a secret po asap but you know what watch something here verse 16. said when i thought to know this it was too painful for me watch the change asap is struggling he's in pain he's hurt he want to give up he want to let it all go going back into going to the world just forget everything that god done done to him but you know god was standing right there listening to asap's heart amen look now look this is what i want you to catch when you go back to the beginning asap did not say i was gone he said i was almost gone my step had well not slipped other words asap let's say this is the world he was standing right here doing this get ready to just give it up but then all of a sudden something pulled him back something changed his view and look what changed asaf's view listen what he says let me get back to my verse he said verse 17 he said until i went into the sanctuary of god then i understood there in other words asap said wait a minute i was getting ready to go god was looking at his son saying lord he went far enough let me pull him back so when asap got back in the sanctuary of god what did he do he got back in church he got back into the word he got back into the things of god and god gave him a new set of glasses amen he began to look differently now it's time for aces to be restored back in his mind back in his spirit to get on track with god watch his language change are we all right this morning verse 18 surely thou shalt has given slippery places thou casted them down into destruction now he's talking about the world in a different site now he envious of what they got he knowing what their end is it's the destruction can we say amen you know like we always say back in my days and we was younger we were always used to turn the grass all the way look greener on the other side hey man but when you get on the other side you realize that dead grass painted with green spray paint all otherwise things ain't what they seem to be but the devil can present to you this is it amen let's keep going here verse 18 surely thou sit is them in simply places thou casted them down into destruction how are they brought into destruct desolation as in a moment they are utterly consumed with terrorists as a dream when one awakens so lord when thou awakens thou shall despise their image his whole thinking has changed because he don't got back into the house of the lord he looking at the world totally different and that's what many of you need it's so many different situations in this in this camp some of you are going through some terrible things in your life but i'm here to let you know it is not over changes take place now changes has been taking place but let you know a man that is a chief can get into a state like that and you and i we're not immune to it amen that's how we grow through our trials temptation that's how we grow can we say amen praise the lord just be being molded but you got to have an understanding when i go through something it's not for god to break me down it's to mold me change me to what he wants me to be you got to look at it right praise the lord let's go to verse 21. he said dust my heart was grieved and i was pricked in my rings what he's doing now he's back in the house of the lord seeing things different now he's going back and looking he's looking looking even deeper now to himself he said my heart was breathed i was pricked in my rings now look at verse 22 he said so foolish was i an ignorant i was a beast before thee now he's doing some real deep repentance let me put it in plain words what he's saying i cannot believe i let myself get this far i can't believe it if you want to get mad at anybody get mad at the devil mad at the devil hey i can't believe i was thinking about walking away from the message walking away from christ all that he done for me and brought me this far and i i'm even mad at the thought of thinking that this is where asaf is at i can't believe i got this far but i'm so thankful god pulled him back you're here so god can pull some of you back see it's easy to be just like asap smile on the camp awkwardly scene like everything is fine but you know what's down in there i'm miserable i need help it's easy to put on a good show i need help that's why god called you hearing you didn't bring yourself here you think you did no god brought you here god knew everybody that's going to be here before the foundation of the world he knew exactly who was going to be here are you with me lord have mercy this time is moving keep following me verse 23 he said nevertheless i am continually with thee he said thou has holding me by my right hand he's acknowledging god hold him but when he was thinking all that it don't seem like god was there but god was actually there when asaph were going through all of this hard time thinking wrong god was right there who do you think being with you all alone when you felt like giving up some of you probably came to the camp well i'll just go for another try maybe something will happen this time you probably came with thoughts like that i'm glad you came because you're going to believe different i'm going to prophesy that over here that's right you're going to leave different we did not come here to waste time we did not come here just to see faces we've never seen before that is not the purpose we came here for lives to be changed and you can leave this camp with a testimony i've been changed i've been renewed i've been restored then you can be a testimony to somebody else walking with their head hanging down you gotta lift your head up look at it kind of have your head down it's time to lift it up because god is the one brought to you here's the one keeping but you'll always fall when you try to keep yourself it's not my power not by might it's by god's spirit he's the one that keeps us they said i said verse 24 he got a whole different attitude he said thou shalt count his thou shall guide me with thy counsel and afterwards received me the glory otherwise you're going to guide me with your accounts and then i'm going to be raptured up out of here he's giving god praise now not the world amen verse 25 who have i in heaven but thee there is none upon earth that i desire to be besides thee my flesh and my heart fellas man this man just being honest she sounds like this be superman oh i'm strong i'm good i got it he being honest just being honest see even as preachers we can appear like superman but we got things we have to deal with too people sometimes you might just give a testimony of things you go through and you know people do some time you you're a preacher though what that got to do with it what's that got to do with it you think preachers are immune to problems and trials no we just know how to hide them better and we do it for your sake because you see us defeated you're gonna be like whoa whoa huh but god got leaders today he got true ministry today that will stand anything that the devil wants to bring even though we had to have some battles we'll still stand and you can too my flesh and my heart faileth because god is the strength of my heart and my portion forever for low they that are far from thee shall perish that has destroyed all of them that go whoring from thee he said but it is good for me to draw near to god i have put my trust in the lord god that i may declare all his works he is restored same asap same frame same body but different thoughts restore it back to those original thoughts brother did you get that video for me i want to show you something some of you some of you i've never seen it don't matter but you probably don't i preached something about this years ago but i want to show you something my interest is this paul said we should not be ignorant of certain devices you got to understand and be able to discern how the devil works because you know that comes to maturity according to the book of hebrews when we can be able to discern good and evil because we're living in a generation they call good evil and they call evil good this is the generation we're living in it's all twisted up but i want to show you something to those that are struggling you know i can see there's some strong young people here you can just sense it then you can see some that are hurting going through something but i still get excited because the ones you that are strong and you know where you're standing you're here to help because you can identify with yourself in the younger more than we can i'm 55 now and some things i can't relate to i'm just being honest i'm gonna give y'all a secret but i'll just go ahead and tell you i don't do it now but you know i was thinking one day i said man i'm getting old i said i can't relate to some of these things these young people do what's going on here if i tell you what i did i got on facebook and you know what i did i read y'all conversations you give reading conversations so whoa this is how they think and then when i go to preach a youth message i'm actually taking their notes of what they think and preaching to them and they think it's discernment no i studied your notes you're told on yourself praise the lord you always tell on yourself you know brother branham said if i go into a man's room or his office i just need to see what he painted on his wall but whatever pictures on his wall tells about him so when you post something on facebook that's a you telling me about you you can't hide it you just tell on yourself oh come on where'd that come from i'ma tell you where it come from it comes from games it comes from thugs now you want to be a message thug that's nonsense man you're trying to identify yourself what the world is what you're doing hello and it's cool no it's not the devil just creeping up so easy till you get so used to those types of things until it becomes normal to you and say ain't nothing wrong with that you tell on yourself man some of these signs they do with their hand i get crimps trying to do that stuff so the way they do it he lets you know it's an anointing to make their body disfigure and they hand disfigure that's a spirit but it's cool and then you know of course being in the message when you try to identify the world life that's you oh yeah you cuz they can spot you you're gonna try to act cool yo what's up they're like he can't even do it right cause you try to live in two worlds there they laughing at you but if you keep standing there you'll adapt to it it'll become normal to you this message this word is so powerful even if you just come into church it might not be boring again but keep coming to church it still puts an anointing on you that people can identify soccer right oh especially the most slick boys sometimes your sister you think you're all strong and powerful but he can still see that little innocence is on you hmm and then if you ain't careful you'll break because they study you girls study bars too there's nothing right but it don't got so bad now we got the slickers in the message trying to manipulate girl's mind then you got girls in the message turning them into a white boy's mind it goes both ways when it shouldn't be neither it shouldn't be neither you ought to want to serve the lord there's nothing wrong wanting to get married nothing wrong with it but it's how people do it brings the problems i've been in this message 30 years but jason i know you've probably been longer than me but you i would have never never thought i would hear the words of young people being divorced in this message when i start hearing them like what they say this just lasted six months what doesn't last three months what's going on and sometimes there's a minister you actually said did i preach hard enough lord did i pray that i do all i can you don't want to blame yourself what happened but what's happening people ain't getting a new birth when you were born again you're going to make sure you married somebody that's born again and you say brother brother they're going to make sure we will have no problems oh yeah you're going to still have problems but you got something inside of you to help you with them problems are you with me i'm gonna just go ahead and show that brother if you got it up there oh you already got it you did that jeremy you the man [Music] i want y'all [Music] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] how many y'all know what that is it's called implosion that's what it's called there's actually only 10 companies they say in the world can do that because it's a it's a it's a craft that's been passed and the companies that do it it comes from generational families that started doing it so they passed it from generation to generation to generation only 10. but they don't call them construction crews they call them destruction crews this is something that is a very unique art i actually seen pictures where they can bring a building down and got building just right beside it and it never bothered the building beside it the only thing bothering the other building beside is the dust that it creates that's how good and precise they are now one thing about this i just wanted to put this and bring it in with asap that building once they start the implosion pushing the detonator it's not even a minute that building comes down now it might took 20 years to build it but just a minute to bring it down are you with me but here is what they do i read some of their notes i'm just going by memory cause they've been years since i i just thought about this on the way to church actually like brother can you put a picture up there what they do they would get a uh when they want the building to be destroyed they would get they would go to the courthouse and get the the original architectural papers of the building they want to look at the blueprints they want to see the strong points they want to see how it structure that's what they they study it so what they're studying they want to see what all of the main points are that holds the building up see the brain the building down they just need the main points they don't need to put explosives into every part of the building they just need to put it in main points so as they study then they go on the site they look around start drilling holes putting dynamite in different places different place it takes them a little while to get them all there but they're just loading all of the dynamites i'm here to tell you satan is the same way he studies you and what he does he studies where your strengths are where your strong points are them the ones he want to blow up in your life to bring you down see the thing about an implosion is different from explosion explosion things go out but implosion it goes in other words it brings its own self down by its own weight and its own gravity but it needs something to start it right cause you say amen so in this right you notice when he played the video you heard a lot of noise you just heard boom boom boom boom boom but the building wasn't going down as yet what was happening all the explosions was going off breaking the building down then all of a sudden it just comes down satan is the same way are you with me he studies you some people are built up just on emotions they're just emotional people and the devil knows that so what he'll start doing putting places in your life that stir your emotions it stirs your emotions up to get you to a place to get so bad till you get depressed you know when you get depressed you don't go up you go down because it's depression it's all over just pushing you down but the devil found places in your life to be able to do that are you with me i've seen people sit in church myself as a pastor and begin to see the devil putting explosives in their lives you see when somebody implodes in the church even amongst you young people when you see somebody fall remember the building is the one that fall but when the dust spreads it affects those that are around it you hear a lot of negative things about the message this one don't fail listen to this this that's the devil just want to put in the bombs even in your life trying to get you to fall the only thing you just got to push away are you with me but gravity if you get to a place you feel so condemned and the devil want to keep you in that con condemnation thought what actually you're going to start doing nobody got to push you down you will bring yourself down with all of that grief you're now imploding now you're walking around like a zombie smile sometimes but you know what's inside you're dying are you with me you see what was happening in the asaph life by him looking at all the things of the world the devil just planted explosives there planting explosives there that's all the thing the devil was doing but i'm so thankful with these implosions once they got everything set it's a pride for that company to see that building come down they just stand far off you ready guys you ready yeah then they push the detonator kick yeah yeah and then the building just come down that's pride see that satan's pride when he can see a building come down are you with me he just loves it i got another one i got another one i got another one but i happened to run across a video where they did an implosion and the building didn't come all the way down the company was tore up it was like big old building just lopsided wow wow it didn't come down and when i thought about that i said praise god praise god my mind went to sampson you see when samson started doing wrong he already had bombs inside of him before he got to delaware delilah was just a detonator he was already loaded time at the time doing wrong doing wrong doing wrong they were just playing it there playing it there planet that planet there then when it got to delilah but what they didn't realize she the detonator was pushed but the building didn't go all the way down amen oh we got samson now we got him but they didn't realize as he was walking around grinding talking to the lord while he talking to god repenting god was putting bombs in simpson now anybody didn't know what was coming you see god had to put samson eyes out so he can see all right see this is how god works jesus said whatever going to offend that going to stop you going into the kingdom of heaven he's going to cut it off if your hand offends cut it off foot cut it off he don't literally mean you want you to cut it off what he's saying whatever's going to get in the way cut it off see sampson eyes was in the way he had a lust problem it's hard for a man to lust when he blind god said these eyes is getting this man this brother in trouble let me let them put them eyes out of them so i can let him really see when samson's eye were taken out now he can see praise the lord that's why god stopped thing cut things off in your life cause he wants you to see not to hurt you but he wants you to see that this girl you think is for you is not for you this boy you think is your friend is not your friend he wants you to see huh and all of a sudden sampson repenting and repenting they didn't realize those locks was growing back they didn't realize it and he said just once more lord and then all of a sudden he had to be led by a child but what they didn't realize he was loaded yeah samson were packed with nuclear weapons of the holy ghost get ready to do something to the enemy as he was walking down down the philistine making smart laughing god had that detonator doing this like this keep on walking son keep on moving son now you're in the right spot and then god said push food amen god will do the same thing for you amen let him load you with the holy ghost you'll go back take back what the devil don't talk from you you'll go back and get it he can do that for you i'm talking to you asap if that's what he's laughing here turn your heart back to god he has not given up on you you are here to be restored you are here to be free amen let's just give you some praise you have been loaded in these sermons you have been loaded with the word to do what the no good ain't how to fight the devil that's what you mean to quit with through these sermons amen praise the lord don't implode explode on the devil [Applause] hey man let him know who you are you got me that time you tricked me that time no more that's why we're not here to condemn you but i got to do like jeremiah root out pluck up tear down but at the end plant and build that's why we had to rebuke sometimes to push them demons back from you friends it's not to condemn you oh lord my time is up god bless you i can't go no more brother man god bless you friends i think you've gone ahead god bless you very much amen somebody say praise the lord my goodness thank you brother burly for that don't you just love the word of god did you watch how god just turned that right back around here brother john preached on restoration last night brother burley preaching on asaph restored and got right there to the end with samson what was god doing god was taking a son who had fallen so low but it doesn't matter how far you go or how low that you fall god can always bring you back amen give god another handclap of praise hallelujah amen you know whether john was preaching last night i thought of it again today as i heard brother burley and brother john showed that picture of the the building that was being restored and showing the different images of the before and after and i thought it was so profound when brother john started showing those images because it shows that restoration as he said is a process and you know oftentimes that process in your life can be discouraging you know my mind goes when uh god took his people out of babylon and through ezra and nehemiah they started rebuilding the walls you know before jerusalem when they came back from babylon jerusalem was everything about what was because everything that they could see visually everything that they looked at all they seen was walls that were torn down destruction and ruin and you know sometimes in your life when and i'm just speaking specifically here because this is just how the lord dealt with me hearing brother burley even this morning you know sometimes ruined trying to rebuild something or trying to get back you know can be discouraging when you look around and all you see is the problems you get to camp and there's excitement and you've got your brothers and sisters and you're you're on fire but then you go face monday morning as brother john said we're preaching to you not for a momentary experience but where the ministry you heard this morning was to so that you have something to fight the devil with on monday when you go home you go home and it's not camping it's not excitement and it's not that you don't have that licks of fire and that faith that you feel in the atmosphere when the words being preached and all you see is all what what isn't and what's out of place and what's ruined in your life and you want to get back but you got to know how you know what you know what the children of israel had to do they couldn't become overwhelmed by what they seen they just had to pick up a tool and one brick at a time one step at a time and so you today i want you to look at your life and say lord i may not be what i need to be but i'm gonna pick up my hammer i'm gonna pick up my tool i'm gonna pick up my axe and one brick at a time lord i'm gonna take a step of faith until i'm standing like you had in your mind before the foundation of the world amen god bless you amen thank you brother burley for that we're going to sing a song maybe it's worship just for a minute lunch is going to start here and i don't have um
