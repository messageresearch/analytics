TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] morning everyone God bless you let's go ahead and stand let's pray Heavenly Father we just come before you Lord and we're so thankful for your mercy and Grace we ask Lord that your presence would be with us Lord that you would come Lord and take your word and make it uh a living reality in our hearts we know Lord your word is the truth Lord and we are Sanctified through that word of Truth Lord that we're Washed by the washing of the water of the word Lord and we're Gathering to that end Lord pray pray that you'd wash us Lord and cleanse us that we would be presented before you without spot or wrinkle or any such thing Lord but be holy and unreprovable in your sight Lord and we we also understand this is not by our works Lord but this is by the effectual working of your blood in the form of in the form of your word Lord working in our lives and so we surrender ourselves to that in Jesus name amen I bless you we're going to continue from seems like a very long long time ago on a word family this will be part nine and we'll read from uh Genesis chapter 3 and verse 16 unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated brother Mark if you want to bring up the PowerPoint just go to the first screen feels like in my mind I need to go back and start over because it's been so long since I've been here um for Sunday school so uh just just a few comments I'll be leaving uh Thursday for Uganda it's kind of a last minute trip a little bit of a long and funny story there but I'll be ministering for brother Abraham for his annual meeting so remember me in prayer brother uh Burley Williams will also be going there so it be a quick trip I think will be like I don't know over maybe 72 hours in transit and uh be there for five days or something like that so pray for me and I've been ever since the trip to Cambodia I've been having some issues with my back so really not looking forward to sitting down for eight hours two different times so need I need a touch from the Lord for sure and uh also remember Addie in prayer she's been she had a pretty rough night with coughing so all right Genesis 3:16 uh as we're reading I'll just make a few comments there before we go in Reading from the it's not up here we have nothing sweet so in the NLT um it it says then he said to the woman I will sharpen the pain of your pregnancy and in pain you will give birth and you will desire to control your husband but he will rule over you so looking at overall the curse that was put upon man and upon woman it's it's distinct man was Cur everything was cursed because of man and it seems here within this there is a uh a curse upon the marriage relationship and that's that's why we so desperately need Christ in the midst of marriage you know the the the na the way of our nature is for a woman to rebel against headship and the way for a man his nature is to overpower the woman so that he does rule over her and so in this is a perversion of God's original intention man was not designed to rule by force amen over his wife wife neither is a woman designed to rebel against headship they're basically the opposite of what the the curse is the opposite of what God has designed she wants to rule over him he wants to be the dictator and if she's going to rebel I will by force make her respect and honor me neither is God's way God's God's way is to lead by love and by wisdom and for the woman God designed her the Bible says that she was designed to have a Meek and quiet spirit and meek doesn't mean weak Meek means e to to be able to be led Moses was the meekest man on the earth he wasn't weak he was strong very strong uh his meekness was he was able to be to hear the voice and Leadership of God and follow it and so that's that's in the design of woman that's in the design of man the position that we find oursel in under the New Covenant with the headship of man and the submission of woman is not a perversion of the original creation it is what the original creation was designed to be under right but we were not it wasn't designed to be like this in gen Genesis 3:16 uh on the one hand a rebellion against headship and on the other hand a perverted patriarchy that Rules by force so I think as time went on and through history especially in the history of the Christian church we find that there was there has been a breakdown of the family unit within the last we'll say 120 plus years um even longer than that because some of the seeds of this feminism were really planted around the time of the Civil War the feminist movement began out of and along with the anti-slavery movement so on the on the you know the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil you know abolishing slavery is a very good thing but what went along with it was not a very good thing and so some of the leading voices of the anti-slavery movement were also feminists Elizabeth Katie Stanton Susan B Anthony this is a quote from Elizabeth Katie Stanton when women understand that governments and religions are human inventions that Bibles prayer books catechisms and encyclical letters are all emanations from the brains of man she wrote Elizabeth Katie Stanton wrote a fiction work which is a woman's Bible a woman's translation of the Bible getting rid of any references to patriarchy so we understand that the foundation of feminism is rebellion against the word of God and this began they began with working towards anti-slavery all all good but then they moved on to other things and and especially for women getting the right to vote which we've covered that and went over that instead of voting being a family affair now it's an individual Affair and I think that's at the very uh core of feminism is this americanism Americanized individualism that's took place in much ways we can't really understand what the world was like back then because we are so colored by individualism even our version of Christianity we we need we need to get the Holy Ghost and get our minds still as message Believers changed and transformed because we many times don't understand the value and the importance of the family unit of the headship of a father even the father looks Through The Eyes of headship as an individual that's not the right way to look at it amen we need to be cleansed of that because what what it is it's a perversion the very salvation certainly is an individual Affair absolutely right but you can never separate that from the outworking of Salvation which is within a family unit when you're a child there's order there's submission and your obedience to God is directly connected to your obedience to the government that God has put in place right in front of you the family as as a as a wife as a as a mother there is a specific order and role that you're called to play you can't say I my salvation is an individual Fair it doesn't matter my responsibility towards my family you're missing then the outworking of your salvation both as a wife salvation is work worked out differently than would be in the husband as a husband you're what you're going to answer for is different than what a woman is going to answer for but in America and American values my goodness what are you talking about we're all individuals no we're all individuals in a family unit and even greater than it within a community of Believers and so this extreme yes salvation is an individual Affair but this extreme individualism is actually Antichrist voting once was looked at simply as a family affair it was connected to the whole family a man a person isn't voting as an individual the man the head of the household is voting because he he know he understands his responsibility as a head of household now because of women getting the right of vote that has been obliterated from our thinking and many of you are thinking here what are all the ramifications of this thought I have I am still thinking about that there there is so much to that to understand as a man your responsibility towards your family it goes far beyond just the basic things that we think about money and providing and all these different things this is this perverted way of even looking at life is from the rise of progressivism and liberalism and individualism same thing it's directly attached to progressivism and liberalism and it's directly the foundation of progressivism and liberalism is what women getting the right to vote and that's the backbone of the Progressive Movement is women and men who submit to women amen now there's a joke there about liberals but we'll just leave that alone once woman had the vote she had the autonomy the individualism the individuality to throw away male headship to throw away the protection of male headship as the deciding factor in her life and when you throw that away what do you get you get a a society that's unsafe for everyone there's much that could be said about that and people de crying the world that we live in and the evils and women aren't safe on the streets I'll agree with you that's how they used to look at it too and there was a whole society built around being sure that women were protected that brewman we safe we could no more go backwards on that than you you'd have to start over from eight people it's it's that bad and that perverted if you if you wanted you know just just imagine trying to uh guard your family as a as a man like a Victorian husband would in the Victoria ER Victorian era people would think you are literally out of your mind in this church they would think you're out of your mind and they're not out of their mind they were doing things in much many ways in the right way to protect the sanctity of Womanhood it was once that in every Christian country the only way that divorce would be allowed was if there was adultery abuse or willful abandonment and it had to be proven and it had to be directed this person's at fault and if if the judge said you just want to get divorced because you don't like each other sorry you can't go home and work it out talk to your preacher in in the 1970s that was our beloved Ronald Reagan in uh California that pushed for no fault divorce he was the first governor to sign it into law and it's slowly become the law of the land so now divorce is easy simple but but the results aren't easy and simple and that was the time when divorce rates of course skyrocketed skyrocketed next thing to come on right after no fault divorce was the birth control pill and again this not to get into the weeds at all but this destroys the proper function of the female body I'm talking about pill based and it leads to sex without consequences and it's it's very unhealthy just in the natural and leads to many other mental physical disorders just so a person can defile their body with any man that comes their way it's literally disgusting well and if if that doesn't work then in the 70s we legalize abortion if if the pill doesn't work you can't have any consequences there well at least you can murder your child these are the perversions this is women's rights this is literally what a presidential campaign ties itself to in order to try to get elected is they want women's votes so bad that they will tie themselves completely to murder openly and it's put on the airwaves in America and anyone that speaks against it you they say my goodness you don't like you don't want women's rights well I don't want women's rights if that's what women's rights are but it isn't women's that's not women's rights that's total perversion total evil it's sacrificing your children to Molech all over again all of this was designed and done and purposely set forth and they didn't even try to hide it in order to destroy the family unit that was the purpose in order for feminism to succeed they said they had to destroy the family unit they had to destroy any need for a husband and it seems that in a society-wide basis it's worked it's worked but it doesn't work for the hearts of humans made in in the image of God and it hasn't produced happiness and it hasn't produced an increase of prosperity and joy it's produced bondage totally his bypassed the sanctity and the sacredness and the function of marriage not only that but the devil's also successfully planted in people's minds that having children is an inconvenience having children is a diff difficult thing having children puts your life on hold that's not what the word of God says that's not what the Bible says and even this attitude sometimes penetrates Us in the message that we think like this this is the wrong way of thinking children are a blessing from God the more you have when you're young the better that's what the Bible says that's a that's Jason dear's paraphrase of it but we'll read it we'll get to it not probably not this time but Lord willing next time instead of saying well if it's God's will we'll have as many as children as we can we'll ask him to guide us in this and the purpose now is how do we keep this as low as possible it's heartbreaking what this is done to our country to Western civilization it's it's the apostasy of the church is the ultimate source of the problem that's what's happened is preachers instead of watching over the flock and preaching the undiluted word of God they've stood and they've modernized and they've modernized and they've compromised and they compromised until the church is barely barely distinguishable from the world it's just one step behind what the world has done and these Spirits are seeking also to penetrate the minds of Believers of this end time message forget about modernism forget about modern day preachers of this this hour this day modern day theologians go back to the word go back to what brother brandham said I I guess I'm laying a foundation for going into that there's many things that brother brandham said and as I began to search and look I was really surprised at how much we miss sometimes you know of course you could say well women have always um sought versions of birth control women have always uh sought to find a way for abortion that's true that's true wicked women have done that and even at the even at at their own Destruction for their own destruction but remember when we legalize these things legalize birth control legalize abortion the consequence consequences of normalizing that puts forth such elude sexual behavior and ethic in the society that now it's so normal it's so so average and to the point where even you know pornography being legalized is that if you go online you almost have to uh have superhuman strength to be able to avoid it because it's the advertising for it is pushing it everywhere and it's a total perversion it never should be legal none of not not one bit of it it's not has nothing to do with free speech it has everything to do with a demon deception to destroy society and to to pervert manhood all of these things have done it um we've talked about talked about a long time ago that even the birth control being used this goes into the water supply and it's almost impossible it's like a practically a what they call a forever chemical it just stays there and it keeps going the process so we when men drink water what does it do it's feminizing men because it's a it's an estrogen and it's overloading our systems and they talk about how uh even sperm counts have gone down so significantly uh all of these things this is the this is absolutely the devil's work the devil's program to destroy a people and really we understand understand it's targeted at the Bride of Jesus Christ ultimately Satan's purpose is to block Christ from having a bride that's what he's trying he'll never do it but we don't it doesn't mean we don't have to have our eyes open to the reality of what's going on around us again all of these things I've been speaking about what is the end result the family unit is degraded and destroyed and we remember the very place what was the original purpose for man what was he told multiply and replenish the Earth and take dominion over it amen and the gospel us being told to go into all the world and preach the gospel it's directly connected to that and what is the primary means that God use uses he uses the church what is a church made up made up of families right that's the that's the norm is a family and the family is the place where the word of God first must be propagated fathers husbands your primary Duty and primary role is not money your primary role is as the head of your wife your secondary role is to raise up your children to fear and walk with God and to learn how to do the same thing that you're and your wife are doing which is raising their children to serve God the greatest place that the gospel is propagated is in a Godly family the second greatest is going into the all the world and preaching the gospel but that's what's that to do bring families in and continue that process and the enemy it has done everything he can to block that and pervert that and even take the I the proper understanding and idea of family out of our minds we have to realize again feminism didn't bring a little bit of good to society it's improved some things feminism is an open attack against the Christian faith it always has been it always will be it always leads to Liberal ation degradation and perversion it should be treated as an enemy against the gospel against God himself and against good Society let's put it that way every True Believer should stand against it should not be ashamed of it we we have allowed the perverts to take the middle ground and say this is normal no living like message Believers lives that's normal take the middle ground and say that's normal act like it's normal feel like it's normal don't feel like you're weird they're weird they're perverted every Christian did like we do in society through all through all of church history until the 20th century treat it like an enemy treat it like it's a perversion act like it's a perversion talk like it's a perversion don't let it be normalized the perversion be normalized in your mind that's Satan's biggest Ploy is to normalize perversion in your mind so that you feel like perversion is in the middle ground and so now you're adjusting yourself towards perversion I was over here as a Believer but all these perverts are normal now so I should just be a little bit no they're not normal stand your ground don't be afraid I I as we get older we're oh more okay with that but as young people I'm speaking to you is don't think that way don't you allow yourself to think that the perverts are normal and you are weird you're following the Bible in fact you probably should be more extreme than you are all right I'm going to close there that way we won't get behind on the schedule for today so let's stand gracious Heavenly Father we come before you Lord and we thank you so much for the revelation of your word in this hour Lord it keeps us clean keeps our hearts and lives clean Lord I pray that you just bless each one here bless the remainder of the service and the Christmas program Lord just be with each one bring healing bring strength Lord bring Supernatural touch May everything go smooth for us today we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you
