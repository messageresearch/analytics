[37:11] thou give me seeing I go childless and
[37:15] the steward of my house is this eleazer
[37:18] of
[37:20] Damascus and Abram said behold to me
[37:22] thou has given no seed and lo one born
[37:25] in my house is mine heir
[37:28] and behold the word of the Lord came
[37:30] unto him saying this shall not be thine
[37:34] Heir but he that shall come forth out of
[37:37] thine own bows shall be thine
[37:40] Heir and he brought him forth abroad and
[37:44] said look now toward heaven and tell the
[37:46] Stars if thou be able to number them and
[37:50] he said unto him so shall thy seed be
[37:54] and he believed in the Lord and he
[37:56] counted it to him for righteousness and
[38:00] he said unto him I am the Lord that
[38:03] brought thee out of her of the chais to
[38:07] give thee this land to inherit
[38:10] it let's

[41:18] okay praise the Lord happy to have him
[41:21] uh here with us today and if I'm missing
[41:23] visitors that won't be strange I do it
[41:25] all the time amen but God bless bless
[41:27] you today Genesis 15 now I just want to
[41:32] make some opening comments as I was
[41:34] starting already to think about the
[41:38] inheritance that we have and what it
[41:40] means to have an inheritance but what it
[41:42] means that you go and Avail yourself and
[41:46] that you have to Avail yourself I
[41:50] promise you if you have an inheritance
[41:52] the attorneys will not come to your
[41:55] house and knock on your door
[41:57] they will say we will be at our office
[42:00] there will be a reading of the will and
[42:02] if you want to know what you get come to
[42:04] the reading and uh and and when you go
[42:07] there you not only uh find out what you
[42:10] have been uh what you have inherited but
[42:13] how to acquire it and then you have to
[42:15] go through sometimes you have to go
[42:17] through legal steps and there's
[42:19] sometimes that that jealous uh people
[42:22] will try to interfere and uh jealous
[42:25] family members and remember that you
[42:27] remember when when um when Boaz goes to
[42:32] court there at the gate that's where in
[42:34] the Eastern custom that the courts were
[42:36] at The City Gate he was a he was a
[42:38] judge and he went to court to settle the
[42:41] matter uh between this nearer kin folk
[42:45] uh to Ruth than he was and that of
[42:48] course that that kin folk represented
[42:50] the devil and because Boaz represented
[42:53] Christ but because that you say well you
[42:55] mean I am closer in kinship to Satan
[43:00] than I am to Christ in a new in a in a
[43:02] fallen birth condition exactly that's
[43:06] why when you're born in sin the Bible
[43:09] teaches us that your mind is actually
[43:12] enmity against God it could never agree
[43:15] with God it has to be God coming to you
[43:19] and giving you the ability I love it
[43:21] brother Richie Douglas always says isn't
[43:23] it isn't it amazing brother Jason he
[43:26] says not only only does he give us the
[43:28] word to believe but he gives us the
[43:30] faith to believe it amen oh this is
[43:33] signed sealed and delivered friends I'm
[43:35] so glad today to know that that we not
[43:38] only are given the word of the hour but
[43:40] we're given the faith to believe it and
[43:43] so so yeah sometimes you know you you
[43:46] you get an inheritance from the Lord
[43:48] Jesus but you know you're still in a
[43:50] fallen body that's a result of sin and
[43:54] I'm here to tell you that you got a
[43:56] close Ken Folk called the devil who's
[43:58] always trying to block you and challenge
[44:01] The Inheritance that Christ has given
[44:03] you so I want to say to you today be
[44:05] like the Apostle Paul and don't live
[44:07] after the flesh but live after the
[44:10] spirit see because the sons of God are
[44:13] led by the spirit of God and the spirit
[44:16] of God I promise you is always and ever
[44:21] going to reveal his word to you amen and
[44:26] that will be the ing I heard brother
[44:27] Jason talking about that this morning in
[44:29] his Sunday
[44:30] school how that you you can't say and
[44:33] I've had people believe it or not I've
[44:35] had people look me in the eye and try to
[44:37] say well God gave me a revelation I
[44:39] could do this and I'm like but that's
[44:42] contrary to his word yeah but he gave me
[44:43] a special privilege and I'm like well
[44:47] the Holy Spirit don't do that and I'm
[44:50] not saying a spirit didn't talk to you
[44:52] I'm just saying the Holy Spirit don't do
[44:53] that figure it out
[44:55] amen so you you cannot contradict uh the
[44:59] word of God nothing can can countermand
[45:03] the words of the Lord or his Apostle
[45:05] Paul we today enjoy we say it all the
[45:09] time we are the final voice to the final
[45:12] age and that's because that we have been
[45:16] restored back to Paul's gospel which was
[45:19] the final voice to all the ages of and
[45:23] Paul's words listen friends let me show
[45:25] you how how how much God invested in St
[45:28] Paul Paul's words cannot be
[45:31] countermanded even by God Amen that's
[45:35] because Paul said I didn't get them on
[45:37] my own I didn't get them from a man the
[45:40] Holy Spirit gave them to me and God will
[45:43] never change his mind about his word and
[45:46] that's why Paul said it doesn't matter
[45:48] who comes saying an angel from heaven if
[45:51] even I come saying different what I have
[45:54] said cannot be changed
[45:59] so so you know and we and you see that
[46:01] that you you can see that in in military
[46:05] uh you know there there are some people
[46:07] invested a lot of people don't know that
[46:09] uh that himler actually was Rex furer
[46:13] and his his orders couldn't be
[46:14] countermanded even by Hitler because he
[46:17] was re furer and so so you see this
[46:19] hierarchical order uh that God uses and
[46:23] it's just man and the devil creating
[46:25] imitations and counterfeit copies of it
[46:28] I'm glad that God is a god of order I'm
[46:30] glad he's a god of his word I'm glad he
[46:33] can't change his word break his word
[46:35] fail at his word I'm so glad to know I
[46:38] have an anchor of the Soul amen
[46:44] amen so we we find um that Abraham here
[46:49] is coming to God in verse two uh don't
[46:54] don't put it back up brother Mark stay
[46:55] with stay with that one have Romans
[46:57] writing I'm going to go there in just a
[46:59] second so we find that Abraham was
[47:02] coming to the Lord and it's interesting
[47:06] because you wouldn't imagine Abram would
[47:08] have done this seeing as how God had
[47:12] already called him in chapter 12 and
[47:16] assured him again in Chapter
[47:18] 13 that he would he would have seed and
[47:22] he would Offspring Have offspring that
[47:24] would exceed the dust and so
[47:28] so but aren't we often like Abram don't
[47:32] we often hear the word of God and we
[47:34] know what he said and we know the
[47:35] promise but
[47:39] circumstances we get involved and we get
[47:41] in the trenches and we get down in the
[47:43] big middle of some conundrum and and we
[47:46] go back to God but Lord you said in your
[47:50] word and the Holy Spirit just goes yeah
[47:54] so what's your point
[47:57] well but it doesn't seem like it's
[47:59] coming to
[48:00] pass I find that when I do God that
[48:03] Abraham's lucky that God came a third
[48:07] time because a lot of times I do God
[48:09] that way he doesn't don't even talk to
[48:10] me at
[48:12] all it's fall silent I'm like okay
[48:14] message message
[48:19] received so you know he he he says this
[48:23] one in my house this one in my house
[48:25] this elaser of Damascus you know I'm not
[48:27] a a linguist and and I'm not going to
[48:29] try to give you a lesson in etymology
[48:31] today but but but just when you when you
[48:35] realize this elaser of
[48:37] Damascus that that actually this elaser
[48:41] was a steward in his house and that word
[48:45] Steward can sometimes actually be your
[48:48] Offspring sometimes it's an adopted
[48:50] person or sometimes you you've adopted a
[48:53] child or sometimes it's that you've
[48:55] taken a child and just put in this
[48:57] position as a steward over your house
[49:01] and and so the word literally uh can
[49:04] mean you know son of possession and he's
[49:07] saying to him this one that's actually
[49:10] not of my loins is a son he's in the
[49:13] position as a son of my possession I
[49:16] know that I came in a fallen body but
[49:19] this is not my
[49:22] inheritance see and so so Abraham you
[49:27] know was was was was trying to stress
[49:30] that God to God and and I and I took a a
[49:33] note out of Bible knowledge commentary
[49:37] and they made a a a funny little word
[49:39] play and they said it's as if Abraham
[49:42] was stressing to God that the omen is in
[49:45] the
[49:46] Gomen and that makes a lot of sense to
[49:48] me because of course an openen is is
[49:51] some event um or you know that it it
[49:55] pends something and it might be good or
[49:58] it might be evil you can say you know
[50:00] Jesus said you know when you see the sky
[50:03] red and lowering that's an omen that
[50:05] pends a certain thing is coming and uh
[50:08] and and it might be something good it
[50:10] might be something evil an omen doesn't
[50:12] NE it means either one uh but we find
[50:15] that that aomen now you'd know the word
[50:17] more perfectly from the word
[50:19] nomenclature which we use in English all
[50:21] the time and and and it's a title it's a
[50:24] name it's a position it's an assignment
[50:27] that you give to something to identify
[50:29] it and they use the example that in back
[50:33] in Roman days that and here's a name
[50:36] that you would know uh when we when we
[50:38] talk about Marcus um Tellus Cicero now I
[50:42] only would know him as cisero but he was
[50:44] a Roman Statesman uh there in the early
[50:47] Roman Republic he was an orator he was a
[50:49] writer and and so they they were saying
[50:52] that that tus was his Gman in other
[50:55] words that wasn't his first name name
[50:57] and they name they're a little bit
[50:58] different than what the way we name we
[51:00] have a first name middle name last name
[51:01] and that last name is our surname that's
[51:03] not exactly how the Romans did it that
[51:05] middle name was his family name it was
[51:08] his gener generational name he was part
[51:11] of that family and then the the third
[51:13] name cisero was was just a refinement to
[51:16] show what branch in the family like I
[51:19] might say I'm Jason's son of Ed and Jean
[51:23] see and so so we realize that
[51:27] that it was his family name and they and
[51:29] they would do that the Romans would
[51:31] often do that uh cpio actually when he
[51:34] when he conquered uh the carth uh uh the
[51:37] uh I forget the what they call them uh
[51:39] the carthaginians there uh in the Punic
[51:42] Wars and when he and because he came
[51:44] back and conquered that part of Africa
[51:46] Africans became part of his name and
[51:49] they kind of attached it on as like a
[51:50] title at at the end of his name so so
[51:53] when we when you when you hear the real
[51:56] reason I'm saying this is so that you
[51:58] can understand that that what Abraham
[52:00] was saying is that that I've got a
[52:04] member of my family that's in the line
[52:08] of inheritance that's not exactly my
[52:10] family and I don't really think it's
[52:12] what you meant when you said I would be
[52:15] the father of Nations right amen
[52:19] amen there's a revelation of God's
[52:23] glory that lives in Believers brother
[52:25] Mark give me Roman Romans
[52:28] 8:18 Paul says here for I reckon that
[52:31] the sufferings of this present time are
[52:34] not worthy uh to be compared with the
[52:38] glory which shall be revealed in us I'm
[52:41] glad for that promise my goodness I am
[52:44] so glad for that promise because
[52:46] sometimes we have a lot of sufferings
[52:48] and sometimes the sufferings are because
[52:51] of failures that we do to ourselves we
[52:53] suffer at our own hands but I'm glad to
[52:56] know that that that my mistakes don't
[52:59] Define me let me say it like this they
[53:02] don't change the definition of who I
[53:04] really am
[53:05] amen yes amen for the earnest
[53:10] expectation this is our expectation of
[53:12] the creature waiteth oh how we wait for
[53:15] the manifestation of the sons of God for
[53:18] the creature was made subject to vanity
[53:20] see not willingly you didn't volunteer
[53:22] to come born in a fallen condition you
[53:25] didn't volunteer to have a human mind
[53:27] that's enmity against God but the whole
[53:30] thing was going to be a Plan of
[53:31] Redemption if God had not subjected you
[53:33] to that and allowed the fall Satan
[53:36] didn't sucker punch God Amen if God God
[53:40] and God didn't entrap Eve but he made
[53:43] her in such a way that she could choose
[53:45] and and and that's before us today we're
[53:48] all here as Mortals and we have Choice
[53:51] amen amen amen you okay with just this
[53:55] this Foundation this laying some
[53:59] foundation so we we find out that that
[54:03] that God in order to
[54:05] accomplish the characteristic within him
[54:08] it had to get out as a
[54:09] redeemer you know there was nothing in
[54:12] Adam Adam did not understand Redemption
[54:14] he had never been lost so I get it I get
[54:17] it I get it I was talking to a minister
[54:18] some years ago and he says you know Adam
[54:21] was God's perfect Masterpiece brother
[54:22] brandham said he was God's perfect
[54:24] Masterpiece I said exactly in the sense
[54:26] up to what he was just like we wouldn't
[54:29] say of Luther and Wesley brother Ram
[54:32] says don't say they didn't have the Holy
[54:34] Ghost don't say they weren't born again
[54:36] they just didn't have the full because
[54:38] the Holy Ghost is parallel is tantamount
[54:42] is equal to the level of word because
[54:46] faith in the word is what brings the
[54:47] Holy Ghost so when we say we have the
[54:50] token restored at the end time like they
[54:52] had at at in Paul's day it's not saying
[54:55] that Christ wasn't walking in the seven
[54:57] lampstands it's not saying he wasn't in
[54:59] the middle it's just simply saying that
[55:01] everything in the middle wasn't him it
[55:04] had become an ad mixture as brother
[55:06] branham's words and so therefore the the
[55:09] amount of token on display it really
[55:12] couldn't be token on
[55:14] display because the token was the full
[55:17] lamb the blood the full blood of the
[55:19] full lamb see so it wasn't it wasn't a
[55:22] part of it it wasn't you know it wasn't
[55:25] the plasma separated out it it was the
[55:28] full body of chemistry of the
[55:31] blood and it had to be on
[55:34] display so he
[55:36] says so because the creature itself also
[55:40] verse 21 let's read 20 again for the
[55:43] creature was made subject to vanity not
[55:46] willingly boy and how but by reason of
[55:50] him who hath subjected the same in Hope
[55:52] because it's all his plan it's all his
[55:55] doing it's all his work word you're his
[55:57] people see this is all about
[56:01] him but by reason of him who hath
[56:04] subjected the same in Hope because the
[56:06] creature itself also shall be delivered
[56:08] from the bondage of corruption into the
[56:11] Glorious Liberty of the children of God
[56:13] thanks be to God
[56:17] Almighty for we know and I promise you
[56:20] do know this you you experience it every
[56:24] day for we know
[56:26] the whole creation this broken world yes
[56:32] amen this struggling
[56:34] nature isn't it amazing that that that
[56:38] nature is broken and in sin but every
[56:41] day the sun rises to give him glory and
[56:43] every day the leaves the leaves you know
[56:46] wave their hands and try to praise him
[56:48] every day the grass comes up and reaches
[56:50] up towards him oh think about you and I
[56:54] friends someday when this earth oh and
[56:56] all sin is gone and we stand in bodies
[56:58] where all sin is gone and all sin is
[57:03] gone but we know that the whole creation
[57:06] granth and travaileth in pain together
[57:09] until now and not only they but we
[57:12] ourselves also which have the first
[57:14] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[57:17] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[57:19] adoption to ITT the Redemption of our
[57:21] body for we are saved by hope but hope
[57:25] that is seen is not hope for what for
[57:28] what a man seeth why do he yet hope for
[57:32] in other words if you already if if this
[57:34] is already the Millennium why do I still
[57:36] hope for a
[57:37] millennium but if we hope for that we
[57:40] see not then do we with patience wait
[57:43] for it now take that down brother Mark
[57:46] let me give you these last two uh 22
[57:49] through 25 from my retranslation of the
[57:51] book of Romans verse 22 23 24 and 25
[57:55] just listen
[57:57] for we know that all creation has been
[57:59] groaning as in the Pains of childbirth
[58:02] up to the present time even we
[58:05] Christians although we have the Holy
[58:08] Spirit within us as a foretaste of
[58:11] future Glory also groan to be released
[58:15] from pain and
[58:17] suffering we too Gran inwardly for that
[58:20] day when God will give us our full
[58:23] rights as his children amen including
[58:27] the new bodies he has promised us free
[58:30] from sensuality and the grave remember
[58:33] brother brandom said all of that was
[58:35] gone in that in that body see and that
[58:37] was just the theophany body imagine what
[58:39] the glorified body would be verse 24 for
[58:42] within salvation we find this hope that
[58:46] we speak of and consider if you already
[58:50] have something you wouldn't continue to
[58:52] hope for it but since we look forward to
[58:54] something we don't yet have we
[58:57] confidently wait for it with patience
[59:00] and composure amen so we're not going
[59:03] crazy with the world we could because
[59:06] the world's crazy and it's easy to join
[59:09] that to get on that bus but I'm here to
[59:11] wait patiently with composure and faith
[59:15] and believing and I want the gifts of
[59:17] the Spirit and the fruit of the spirit
[59:20] and I want all of that moving in and out
[59:22] of my life freely without obstacle amen
[59:26] without me getting in the way that's
[59:28] right we have seen the enemy and it is
[59:31] us for sure
[59:35] amen so God blesses his creation we know
[59:39] that uh we we can read about it you know
[59:43] the the Bible tells us that you know you
[59:46] remember that that as he moved through
[59:50] what we would call true Bible um
[59:54] Evolution there is a true true Evolution
[59:56] just like there's a true Trinity there's
[59:58] a Bible Trinity there's a Bible
[1:00:00] Evolution it's not darwinian that's a
[1:00:02] lie it's not three persons in a godhead
[1:00:05] that's a lie that's ancient Babylonian
[1:00:08] polytheism and Hislop track traced that
[1:00:11] through the lineage from because you're
[1:00:13] you're going to come straight there once
[1:00:15] you come out of the Garden of Eden and
[1:00:16] leave Cain and Abel and then you go
[1:00:18] through the lineage you're going to and
[1:00:20] then you're you're you're going to get
[1:00:21] to the point where you're you're going
[1:00:23] to encounter Enoch you're going to
[1:00:24] encounter a flood and then right away
[1:00:27] there's there it's not going to be very
[1:00:29] long by the time you get to another
[1:00:31] chapter you're got a flood the world's
[1:00:33] destroyed and then out comes Noah and
[1:00:35] his three sons and they start again and
[1:00:36] the next thing you find is they're in in
[1:00:39] and that's going to lead to
[1:00:41] Nimrod and Nimrod and the Bible shows
[1:00:44] and Hislop shows us that he was the
[1:00:46] first one I think it's even maybe in the
[1:00:48] scripture I can't remember if I'm uh you
[1:00:51] know transcribing that in my mind over
[1:00:54] into scripture but he was the first one
[1:00:56] to carry War to his neighbors amen and
[1:01:00] from right there that's what Daniel saw
[1:01:02] Daniel saw those four Gentile kingdoms
[1:01:05] the the Babylonian and he saw animals
[1:01:07] that and they all represented different
[1:01:09] animals and and in various places it's
[1:01:12] one animal in another place it's a
[1:01:13] different kind but anyway it was that
[1:01:16] Babylonian then the meop Persian and
[1:01:17] then the Grecian and then the Roman and
[1:01:19] it's curious that when Daniel is
[1:01:23] describing every Beast concerning
[1:01:26] Babylon Persia and Greece he's naming an
[1:01:30] animal that we can all associate within
[1:01:32] nature yeah talks about a lion talks
[1:01:35] about a ram he talks about a goat he
[1:01:38] talks about it one when he's talking
[1:01:39] about it again it's a it's a leopard and
[1:01:41] all these different things and we get it
[1:01:43] but when Daniel comes to the fourth
[1:01:45] Beast he can't this is weird he's he's
[1:01:50] well he's Fierce and he's got iron teeth
[1:01:54] and he's he he's he's monstrous and and
[1:01:57] and Daniel can't he can't you know going
[1:01:59] through his Rolodex of animals he can't
[1:02:01] exactly what I'm seeing I can't I don't
[1:02:04] know what to call it and we're just
[1:02:06] going to call it a beast and it was that
[1:02:07] fourth Roman Beast it was so powerful
[1:02:11] that when that as Rome when it ceased
[1:02:15] being political Rome it just switched
[1:02:18] and became it went from Pagan Rome to
[1:02:20] Papa Rome and and then and then coming
[1:02:23] out of Papa and then Papa Rome is the
[1:02:25] one who perverted the godhead and water
[1:02:27] baptism and the original sin and
[1:02:29] election and all these different things
[1:02:30] and it and it and it took down all of
[1:02:33] the ancient Babylonian Gods that they
[1:02:36] prayed to in the stars and the planets
[1:02:38] and you know it took down Jupiter and
[1:02:39] Mars and it put up Venus and put up you
[1:02:41] know for Peter put up Mars for Paul and
[1:02:44] and this one for that one oh and I'm I
[1:02:46] and and and the whole church became an
[1:02:49] adulterous woman and the Bible shows
[1:02:52] that that it's Jezebel that they finally
[1:02:54] would Crown a fall false prophet and sit
[1:02:56] Jezebel on the throne but then God would
[1:02:59] come and begin to restore it back and
[1:03:02] then Luther would come out of that and
[1:03:03] Luther would carry because he didn't
[1:03:05] have all the light he's going to carry
[1:03:06] some of that with him and it comes down
[1:03:08] to our day and I I've told you many
[1:03:11] times it was north of 33,000 the latest
[1:03:14] number I've heard is 40,000 different
[1:03:17] denominations and various independent
[1:03:19] Christian organizations 40,000 out of
[1:03:23] one amen when they first started in the
[1:03:26] early church every church was a message
[1:03:30] Church there was no such thing as a
[1:03:32] Christian Church that wasn't a message
[1:03:34] church because the message is the gospel
[1:03:37] in its pure form that's what we've been
[1:03:39] restored back to thank God Amen thank
[1:03:43] God so so I you know I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:03:47] just drawing you into my picture trying
[1:03:49] to trying to express the way it it feels
[1:03:51] to me so so God you know He
[1:03:56] blesses his
[1:03:58] creation as he moves through his
[1:04:01] Evolution but but when he but when he
[1:04:05] makes
[1:04:07] Man In His Image when he gets up to that
[1:04:10] sixth day and he makes Man In His Image
[1:04:14] he's actually going to give his family
[1:04:17] an additional blessing amen that wasn't
[1:04:20] upon everything else it would be a
[1:04:23] blessing that would set them apart art
[1:04:26] from all other living creatures so that
[1:04:30] not only as
[1:04:32] Sons not only uh you know are we known
[1:04:35] as God's creatures that can generate uh
[1:04:39] New Life by being fruitful and you know
[1:04:42] the text every seed bringing forth of
[1:04:44] its kind so not only do we have the
[1:04:47] blessing as other animals that we can
[1:04:50] bring forth light by being uh life by
[1:04:53] being fruitful every seed after its kind
[1:04:55] but we've also been appointed as God's
[1:04:59] representative image
[1:05:02] amen and that's a that's next level
[1:05:05] blessing because now we're in a form
[1:05:08] we're created in His image and we're
[1:05:10] literally God's representative image do
[1:05:13] you wonder why that's so much preaching
[1:05:18] from a message Pulpit deals with how you
[1:05:21] should dress how you should conduct
[1:05:24] yourself things you should do and
[1:05:26] shouldn't do amen amen do you ever
[1:05:30] wonder why because we are supposed to be
[1:05:33] God's representative
[1:05:36] image so our place and our commission
[1:05:39] above all other created things is to
[1:05:43] rule and to
[1:05:45] oversee the this whole flourishing World
[1:05:50] on God's behalf amen Prophet said God
[1:05:54] didn't create the world for himself to
[1:05:55] rule created for man to rule God rules
[1:05:58] the universe
[1:05:59] see so this is actually a main stay that
[1:06:02] sets our blessing apart from the
[1:06:05] blessing of all others uh that that that
[1:06:10] and and here and here and here's a and
[1:06:12] here's another main stay that as such as
[1:06:16] the God's image
[1:06:18] bearers a main stay that sets our
[1:06:21] blessing apart from the blessing on all
[1:06:24] others is that we receive the privilege
[1:06:27] of eating from the Tree of blessing
[1:06:29] itself
[1:06:31] amen which is the tree of God's eternal
[1:06:34] life the Tree of Life the tree of God's
[1:06:36] eternal life and how do we partake of it
[1:06:40] how how did Adam and Eve partake of it
[1:06:45] because they couldn't partake of it
[1:06:46] directly it hadn't become flesh Yet
[1:06:48] brother Ram showed us that that's the
[1:06:50] great mystery the world misses that
[1:06:52] that's why they get it all tangled up
[1:06:54] and think he ate a piece of fruit like
[1:06:55] an
[1:06:57] apple because they're not realizing that
[1:07:00] that the way Adam and Eve partook of
[1:07:02] that fruit that and brother brandom
[1:07:03] talks about it sustained their life it
[1:07:05] it renewed their life was they did it by
[1:07:08] obeying his
[1:07:09] word they didn't go down a path to a
[1:07:12] tree and pick a piece of fruit they
[1:07:14] could eat the the fruit and the trees
[1:07:16] and the herbs were all for their meat
[1:07:18] but there was a there was a way of
[1:07:21] partaking of the tree of life and that
[1:07:23] was by obeying the word because the Tree
[1:07:26] of Life The Water of Life the bread of
[1:07:29] life the Word of Life they're all the
[1:07:31] same thing they're all Jesus Christ
[1:07:36] amen so since Jesus had not yet become
[1:07:39] flesh as brother brandham shows us they
[1:07:42] could not directly partake of him as a
[1:07:45] human man walking with them like like we
[1:07:49] will have in the Millennium so they
[1:07:52] partook of him by obeying his word and I
[1:07:54] would say to you today it's the same
[1:07:56] today it's exactly the same today you
[1:07:59] don't have access to him in his
[1:08:01] Incarnation like you will have in the
[1:08:04] Millennium with Jesus in a glorified
[1:08:07] body but let me tell you you do have
[1:08:10] access to him you access him you access
[1:08:13] his blood you access his Saving Grace
[1:08:16] you access his Redemptive power through
[1:08:19] obeying the
[1:08:22] word there's no other way to be born
[1:08:25] again outside of an agreement with God's
[1:08:27] word coming to it by Revelation to
[1:08:30] hear many he to recognize many are
[1:08:34] called few are chosen and to act upon
[1:08:38] his
[1:08:41] word but there's another
[1:08:45] tree now remember I'm talking you today
[1:08:51] about availing ourselves of our
[1:08:54] inheritance
[1:08:56] amen or
[1:08:57] not
[1:09:00] amen because there is another tree to
[1:09:03] eat from and we would call it as we as
[1:09:06] the Bible would say the tree of
[1:09:09] knowledge which of course is Satan
[1:09:11] brother brandham said if the tree of
[1:09:12] life is Jesus then the tree of knowledge
[1:09:14] is certainly Satan so it's Satan in his
[1:09:19] desires and I and and I want you just to
[1:09:21] think about what it means to indulge
[1:09:24] with Satan with his desires and we find
[1:09:28] ourselves carried away with the nonsense
[1:09:30] of the world and we don't sometimes we
[1:09:32] just take that too lightly do you
[1:09:34] understand that you're you're consorting
[1:09:37] with the tree of
[1:09:38] knowledge that has the the
[1:09:41] unabashed confessed
[1:09:44] openly desire to ascend above God
[1:09:50] Amen you say to me today brother Jason
[1:09:53] goodness grieve goodness I I I I don't I
[1:09:56] don't want anything to do with that
[1:09:58] nasty guy you know but sometimes that
[1:10:01] that tree of life can can come down to a
[1:10:04] metaphor and just represent for us a
[1:10:08] decision or decisions where we find
[1:10:11] ourselves trying to seize abundance and
[1:10:15] life on our own
[1:10:18] terms and by our own wisdom
[1:10:22] amen that's still a pursuit of the tree
[1:10:25] of
[1:10:26] knowledge when you are trying to seize
[1:10:29] abundance and life on your own terms by
[1:10:31] your own wisdom I'm going tell you
[1:10:33] something friends that's when you need
[1:10:34] to stop drop and roll you are on
[1:10:37] fire you need to find an altar somewhere
[1:10:40] and say Lord God not like Jesus not my
[1:10:43] will thy will be done
[1:10:47] amen now I'm going to read some
[1:10:50] statements out of some quotes and I
[1:10:51] didn't put them on the overhead on
[1:10:53] purpose because uh I would rather have
[1:10:55] the the effect of just reading it to
[1:10:59] you and I'll read and comment as I go
[1:11:02] now brother Brandon boy there's just
[1:11:04] nobody can even use the language so
[1:11:07] confidently like a prophet I just love
[1:11:09] how he uses it just it creates such a
[1:11:11] picture in my mind so he's going to talk
[1:11:14] about you know man you remember there in
[1:11:16] the in the with the Tower of
[1:11:19] Babel that their whole thing was we're
[1:11:23] going to build us a tower
[1:11:26] and there's two things we're going to
[1:11:28] try to break back into something we're
[1:11:30] going to build it up to God and that way
[1:11:33] if God decides to flood the Earth again
[1:11:35] we just run in our Tower up to where he
[1:11:37] is and he have to flood himself to flood
[1:11:39] us see and then brother brandham with
[1:11:42] prophetic Insight just like just like
[1:11:45] Isaiah knew the heart of Lucifer thou
[1:11:49] has said in thine heart boy Lucifer
[1:11:51] didn't want that known and Isaiah so
[1:11:53] added him to the whole world put it in a
[1:11:55] book and send it to the whole
[1:11:57] world and and and so brother brandham
[1:12:00] goes into the heart of those people and
[1:12:02] he says see they
[1:12:05] knew they had fallen from something we
[1:12:09] it's not right what why do we die why
[1:12:12] job had that question it's not an
[1:12:14] unreasonable question see it what's next
[1:12:19] is the question you hear what's after
[1:12:20] this is there an afterlife what's next
[1:12:22] some people say oh there's nothing some
[1:12:23] people say oh that's crazy of course has
[1:12:25] to be something they just don't know
[1:12:26] what it
[1:12:27] is brother brandham says it like this in
[1:12:30] the breach between the seven Church ages
[1:12:32] and the Seven Seals would you imagine
[1:12:34] someone falling from the earth now just
[1:12:36] try to picture this in your mind they're
[1:12:38] falling from the earth down into a deep
[1:12:40] pit
[1:12:41] somewhere and was struggling climbing
[1:12:44] pulling they must by some means get out
[1:12:47] of this pit they're not in their
[1:12:49] original state and frankly they're
[1:12:51] screaming they're clawing the walls
[1:12:53] making a noise and
[1:12:56] doing some way they're they're groaning
[1:12:59] because that they want to get back to
[1:13:02] their original state
[1:13:04] amen that's why a person that's struck
[1:13:08] with disease aches and pains one time
[1:13:10] they wasn't that way but they are
[1:13:13] groaning why they're not they're not
[1:13:15] right something's
[1:13:17] wrong I cannot there's something in me
[1:13:20] intrinsically that says I'm not supposed
[1:13:22] to get sick and hurt and age there's
[1:13:25] something intrinsic intrinsic in me that
[1:13:27] cries out for a new body and a new world
[1:13:30] this one's broken this one's
[1:13:33] wrong this is nothing but Warfare and I
[1:13:36] long for peace I want a
[1:13:39] rest
[1:13:42] sir see they're groaning because they
[1:13:45] want to get back to their original state
[1:13:47] that's why a person struck with disease
[1:13:48] aches and pains one time they wasn't
[1:13:50] that way but they're groaning why that's
[1:13:52] not right there's something wrong
[1:13:55] they're groaning trying to get back to
[1:13:57] where they was when they had health now
[1:14:00] now he's going to flip it and come down
[1:14:02] from the natural into the spiritual and
[1:14:04] when and when Nature and peoples as the
[1:14:08] Bible said we read it in our text in
[1:14:10] Romans when we see nature and peoples
[1:14:13] are groaning it
[1:14:16] shows something that they're not in
[1:14:19] their ought to be condition they have
[1:14:21] fallen from somewhere I'm so glad he
[1:14:24] said it that way and I because sometimes
[1:14:27] I have to come to a painful grips with
[1:14:30] my own shortcomings and failures but I
[1:14:32] can just say but Lord I I wasn't
[1:14:34] supposed to be like this and I'm not
[1:14:36] going to stay like this and I I still
[1:14:38] believe your word and I got another this
[1:14:42] coming I'm going from this back to that
[1:14:45] what I was before I became
[1:14:48] this they're not in their ought to be
[1:14:51] conditioned they have fallen from
[1:14:52] somewhere see we shouldn't have
[1:14:55] to cry and lament over sickness we
[1:14:58] shouldn't have to cry and lament over we
[1:15:01] shouldn't have to cry and lament over
[1:15:03] our lost children they're supposed to be
[1:15:05] a Heritage of the Lord given to us and
[1:15:07] they're supposed to be part of our
[1:15:08] inheritance and they are but we find
[1:15:11] ourselves groaning and struggling and
[1:15:13] crying because we we see the Wayward
[1:15:16] track but just know this God has this
[1:15:19] seal the Lord knows all of them that are
[1:15:22] his and if they're yours they're his
[1:15:29] Hallelujah so he
[1:15:33] says now we don't need anybody to
[1:15:35] interpret that for us of course we know
[1:15:39] what it was eternal life they had fallen
[1:15:42] from they lost their claims on eternal
[1:15:45] life by the fall of Adam and Eve who
[1:15:47] fell from life to death and the Garden
[1:15:49] of Eden brought all nature under them to
[1:15:50] death a tree never died before Adam an
[1:15:53] animal Wouldn't Die for Adam and there's
[1:15:55] only one thing that cannot die and
[1:15:57] that's God because he's Eternal that's
[1:15:59] the only way we can ever keep from dying
[1:16:02] we have to have eternal life in us to be
[1:16:04] Sons and Daughters of God isn't that
[1:16:06] beautiful
[1:16:08] amen he says now we are
[1:16:12] given free moral
[1:16:16] agency and I keep circling back remember
[1:16:19] are you going to go to the
[1:16:21] reading are you just going to stay away
[1:16:23] from it you You' got an inheritance but
[1:16:27] you you know what you've done today when
[1:16:28] you come to church you came to the
[1:16:29] reading of the will now are you going to
[1:16:32] leave here and go claim it and take
[1:16:33] possession of it see amen we were given
[1:16:38] free moral agency it was given to them
[1:16:40] just as we so to make a choice now Adam
[1:16:43] and Eve in the beginning there was a
[1:16:45] tree of right and wrong before them and
[1:16:46] that same tree sets before each and
[1:16:48] every one of us did you hear that there
[1:16:52] was a tree that set before them and that
[1:16:54] not a different tree that same tree of
[1:16:56] knowledge of Good and Evil sets before
[1:16:58] you and I amen every one of us God God
[1:17:02] isn't doing for Adam or for Eve you say
[1:17:05] well that it's their fault no not now it
[1:17:07] isn't it's your fault you can't place it
[1:17:09] on Adam now you got to place it on
[1:17:11] yourself because right and wrong is set
[1:17:14] before you we're on the same basis as as
[1:17:17] Adam and Eve but you see when we are
[1:17:20] redeemed we no more want our own choice
[1:17:23] but we want his
[1:17:25] yes oh friends when I F when I first
[1:17:28] read him it it it almost makes you stop
[1:17:31] breathing right in wrong is set before
[1:17:34] you as pilate said what shall I do now
[1:17:38] that's not pilate now it's you that's
[1:17:40] why brother brandham came 2,000 years
[1:17:42] after pilot said that preached a whole
[1:17:44] sermon and he comes down pilot said what
[1:17:47] shall I do with Jesus called the Christ
[1:17:49] what shall you do everybody has to ask
[1:17:51] that question what shall I do about his
[1:17:54] word word I'll either give it lordship
[1:17:57] over my life and I will be his worthy
[1:18:00] image Bearer to the world or I'll go
[1:18:03] after Chasing Life and and success and
[1:18:06] abundance using my own will and my own
[1:18:11] wisdom right and wrong is set before you
[1:18:14] because that's really the rub isn't
[1:18:17] it how do I get past this sinful nature
[1:18:21] of my birth that betrays me and in
[1:18:24] enslaves me I want to tell you something
[1:18:27] friends the
[1:18:29] extraordinary merciful Saving Grace in
[1:18:33] The Plan of Redemption is seen in his
[1:18:36] last line but you see when we are
[1:18:40] redeemed we no more want our choice we
[1:18:44] want his
[1:18:47] choice I'm so glad for
[1:18:51] that but brother Jason what about the
[1:18:54] sin that's still dwells in my members as
[1:18:56] Paul said that is my flesh well you
[1:18:59] know we just finished up a 10-part
[1:19:02] series on on how to overcome that amen
[1:19:06] so uh we we we spent 10 uh sessions
[1:19:09] answering precisely that question didn't
[1:19:14] we let me give you another answer to it
[1:19:17] that I didn't cover in 10 parts so this
[1:19:19] will be part 10
[1:19:23] B brother brandom says from Shalom you
[1:19:27] okay I told sister de today I said I'm
[1:19:29] just going to relax I'm just going to
[1:19:31] relax not going to tr not going to try
[1:19:33] to do it
[1:19:34] and not going to try to overdo it but
[1:19:37] I'm also not gon to try to underdo it
[1:19:40] amen I'm I'm not going to cover it all I
[1:19:42] can already see I got pages and pages
[1:19:44] but I I do want to get to to a certain
[1:19:46] conclusion at least for
[1:19:49] today so brother brandham comes in 1964
[1:19:52] to this message Shalom he's in vist I
[1:19:58] believe um that might stand correction
[1:20:00] but at any rate he
[1:20:03] says remember the composer knows the end
[1:20:06] from the beginning he knows all about it
[1:20:08] that's the reason he could write it here
[1:20:09] correctly now you must begin with him
[1:20:11] and you must begin if you want to hear a
[1:20:15] symphony you begin with him in the music
[1:20:18] at the symphony you you listen you know
[1:20:20] what it says it's going to be what the
[1:20:22] symphony is then you begin to listen at
[1:20:25] the music so in other words you're
[1:20:28] you're you're there because you're a you
[1:20:31] know you're a connoisseur of great of
[1:20:33] these great Symphonies written by these
[1:20:36] great Masters and maestros and you
[1:20:38] understand uh you already a schooled in
[1:20:41] the thought behind it you know the
[1:20:42] movements The Melodies you know the what
[1:20:44] the crescendo means you know when it
[1:20:45] gets quiet when it gets yeah right amen
[1:20:48] so brother Brandon this is the point
[1:20:50] he's trying to make you're you're with
[1:20:52] it see now watch he he'll go deeper and
[1:20:56] you know what it is you know just about
[1:20:58] it here's where certain certain things
[1:21:01] takes place and you're sitting there
[1:21:02] waiting oh I love this part here it
[1:21:07] comes you know he says you're waiting
[1:21:10] for a certain certain thing that takes
[1:21:12] place now it's it's got to change now
[1:21:15] now to anybody else that don't know
[1:21:17] nothing about that just walked in and
[1:21:19] sat down it's a bunch of nonsense
[1:21:21] rattling
[1:21:22] noise see
[1:21:24] but the one who knows what it is now
[1:21:28] we've got a great
[1:21:30] composer who wrote A Great
[1:21:33] Masterpiece and he's got changes and
[1:21:36] movements and he doesn't it's not just
[1:21:38] you know one page it's page after page
[1:21:41] of Mastercraft Mastercraft Mastercraft
[1:21:45] and we're we're just we're we're are
[1:21:47] you're you're the you're the musicians
[1:21:49] you're under the direction of the
[1:21:50] conductor and the conductor's in harmony
[1:21:53] with the composer and the composer and
[1:21:55] the conductor and the musicians they're
[1:21:57] all they're all moving as one and it
[1:21:59] begins to sweep people away in their
[1:22:02] emotions people begin to weep people
[1:22:04] begin to
[1:22:05] faint you can become so overwhelmed with
[1:22:08] the Majestic Beauty of some of these
[1:22:12] pieces and he
[1:22:15] says he says you you to others it's just
[1:22:18] not it's nonsense but to the one who
[1:22:20] knows what it is it's beat out with the
[1:22:24] music drummed out with the notes it's
[1:22:26] trumpeted with the trumpets it's strung
[1:22:27] with the harp it's played with the
[1:22:28] violin this is all happening in real
[1:22:31] time
[1:22:32] simultaneously and everybody's
[1:22:34] grooving
[1:22:36] see it's played with the violin it's
[1:22:38] beat on the bass it's sounded by the
[1:22:40] Trum but it's beat on the drums the
[1:22:42] whole thing together in Rhythm and it
[1:22:45] makes the drama till you can close your
[1:22:51] eyes and live in it
[1:22:56] Hallelujah he
[1:22:58] says if man could lose close his mortal
[1:23:02] eyes to Earthly sight and live in the
[1:23:06] presence of Jesus Christ when you see
[1:23:09] his word being beat out in the great
[1:23:11] Symphony that we're living in now
[1:23:13] changing see you must you say oh I
[1:23:16] that's please I want to do that I I want
[1:23:19] that to be me you must begin in the
[1:23:22] symphony you can't be in the symphony
[1:23:26] following the Sheep music if you're
[1:23:28] feeding and your whole life is being
[1:23:30] directed by the tree of knowledge that's
[1:23:32] not going to work you're you're out of
[1:23:34] sync you're not even in the same key you
[1:23:36] don't even got the same sheet music
[1:23:38] you're going to be exposed as as a fraud
[1:23:41] as a fake Christian I'm here to tell you
[1:23:44] I'm not here to chase life or the
[1:23:46] abundance of Life by my own wisdom and
[1:23:48] by my own choices the tree of knowledge
[1:23:50] of Good and Evil sets before every one
[1:23:53] of us today
[1:23:56] if man could just close his mortal eyes
[1:23:59] to the Earthly sight and live in the
[1:24:01] presence of Christ when you see the word
[1:24:04] being beat out in the great Symphony
[1:24:05] that we're living in now changing you
[1:24:07] must begin in the symphony the only
[1:24:09] thing you can
[1:24:10] do if you're in the symphony then you
[1:24:13] start you begin now watch here he goes
[1:24:16] you wna you wanna here's my here's my
[1:24:18] extra piece on how to overcome the flesh
[1:24:20] Redemption overcame the inner man amen
[1:24:24] how did I how did I get that that old
[1:24:26] man to die by a revelation of the word
[1:24:29] of God I was born again filled with the
[1:24:31] Holy Spirit but what I do about this
[1:24:33] flesh amen the only thing you can do if
[1:24:36] you're in the symphony
[1:24:37] symphony then you start you begin to get
[1:24:41] into the
[1:24:42] Rhythm you begin to get into the Rhythm
[1:24:46] did you know this has a rhythm for your
[1:24:49] life this has a beat this has a Harmony
[1:24:53] it's harmonious with the mind of God as
[1:24:56] you read it oh I see father oh now I
[1:24:59] know what you want me to do I wondered
[1:25:01] and then Paul said I should go back and
[1:25:03] and and look at my examples and what you
[1:25:05] did and brother brandom said if you get
[1:25:07] in a a fix and you don't know what to do
[1:25:10] go back and just find yourself somebody
[1:25:12] in the Bible that had that same problem
[1:25:15] and start rocking like they Rock and
[1:25:17] start moving like they move and when you
[1:25:19] do the same thing they did God will
[1:25:21] bring you out the same way he brought
[1:25:22] them out he's he's unchanging in his
[1:25:26] word he's the same yesterday today and
[1:25:28] forever he'll act for you today just
[1:25:30] like he did for Moses coming out of
[1:25:32] Egypt he'll act just like he did for
[1:25:34] Joshua when he took Jericho he'll act
[1:25:37] just like he did for Jesus when he
[1:25:38] walked on the
[1:25:43] water so brother Brenham explains this
[1:25:46] principle and he goes on he he he
[1:25:50] explains this same principle in in in
[1:25:53] the dance and in a ball
[1:25:55] game and he says you had to become part
[1:26:00] of the dance to get out of the dance see
[1:26:02] to get anything out of it you got to get
[1:26:04] in it man see you have to become part of
[1:26:08] the ball game something you're
[1:26:10] interested in to get in the ball game
[1:26:13] you see friends I I because I've passed
[1:26:16] from Death to life I'm already at the
[1:26:18] dance I'm already at the ball game but
[1:26:21] I'm not a part of either one of them
[1:26:23] until I engage
[1:26:25] with
[1:26:26] it how do I overcome My Flesh engage
[1:26:30] with the spirit of the
[1:26:31] composer
[1:26:34] see he says you have to become part of
[1:26:37] the word to know God's Symphony his
[1:26:41] symphony is when it's playing you
[1:26:43] understand you're marching with the beat
[1:26:45] of the time you're watching for it the
[1:26:48] works that I do shall you also greater
[1:26:50] than this shall you do these last days
[1:26:53] oh my
[1:26:55] he says here the great changing of time
[1:26:58] we get into the beat beat of the word
[1:27:00] this is why we are not a denomination
[1:27:03] amen because the beat of the word beats
[1:27:06] on past that this is why we're not this
[1:27:09] is why brother bom said I'm against
[1:27:11] organized religion because if you stay
[1:27:14] in organized religion you've got you've
[1:27:16] got one or two pages of whatever they
[1:27:18] put a period on and then all the rest of
[1:27:21] it it might as well not even have it
[1:27:23] because you you're not allowed to
[1:27:24] operate in it but I'm not part of a part
[1:27:27] I'm part of a
[1:27:31] whole you got to get into the r rhythm
[1:27:33] of it how does he do it if you get into
[1:27:35] the word you find out how he did it at
[1:27:37] the beginning then you know how he does
[1:27:39] it all the time so so if you think that
[1:27:43] through I'm still okay on my time you
[1:27:45] still
[1:27:46] good so if if you think that through
[1:27:49] this is exactly why that modern
[1:27:52] Christianity does not recognize the
[1:27:55] power and demonstration of the word when
[1:27:57] they see it when they actually see it
[1:28:00] and they call it mental telepathy or
[1:28:01] they call it you know you hypnotize
[1:28:04] those people people get people blind can
[1:28:07] suddenly see you hypnotize them wow
[1:28:12] bring on the hypnotist pay them a
[1:28:14] gazillion
[1:28:15] dollars
[1:28:18] see so he says find out how he did it at
[1:28:22] the beginning then you know what he's is
[1:28:24] doing in it all the time so so the
[1:28:28] mistake that organized religion makes is
[1:28:30] that they
[1:28:31] misrepresent what he's
[1:28:34] doing and a lot of times good people
[1:28:36] they misrepresent it because they don't
[1:28:38] know see the Paul said the God of this
[1:28:42] age hath blinded them amen see but God
[1:28:47] gave them a legitimate chance to come to
[1:28:49] light light shined in Darkness Darkness
[1:28:52] comprehended it not you'd say well then
[1:28:54] it's not their fault it you could think
[1:28:56] that until you go read the gospels and
[1:28:58] then you know that Jesus showed it to
[1:29:00] them and they made a conscious choice to
[1:29:02] rejected
[1:29:04] see their eyes the Bible says Jesus said
[1:29:07] that that to them their eyes they have
[1:29:09] closed don't go blaming
[1:29:13] God they see the Miracles and things
[1:29:16] that they read in the Bible and they
[1:29:17] believe it was for the apostles only or
[1:29:20] they they try to tell us it was from
[1:29:21] some general age in a in a on day any
[1:29:25] age anything but this age see uh just
[1:29:28] not the one we're living in now and and
[1:29:30] the Bible says having a form of
[1:29:33] godliness but denying the power brother
[1:29:36] Ram talks about the authority within the
[1:29:39] word to to really affect change in our
[1:29:41] lives people they they have a form of
[1:29:44] godliness but they deny the power to
[1:29:46] change them amen don't let me just have
[1:29:49] the name of Christian but don't don't
[1:29:51] change anything see wow so you're you're
[1:29:55] throwing off and and and you're you're
[1:29:58] you're denying the
[1:30:00] responsibility to become the image of
[1:30:02] the word that's what you're
[1:30:05] doing I'm not here to hurt your feelings
[1:30:07] but this the house of judgment that's
[1:30:10] exactly what you're doing you're
[1:30:11] throwing off when you will not let the
[1:30:13] word when your life when you will not
[1:30:15] let your life say Amen to every word you
[1:30:18] say but you know does that mean I'll
[1:30:20] never make a mistake of course it
[1:30:22] doesn't mean that that's the whole Reon
[1:30:24] you let the word have say so so you make
[1:30:26] less of those and the ones you make you
[1:30:28] get forgiveness for and you do
[1:30:32] better but when you throw off and you
[1:30:35] deny the responsibility to become the
[1:30:37] image of the word say how did I become
[1:30:40] responsible for it because you were born
[1:30:43] in His image you were given an
[1:30:45] additional blessing above all other
[1:30:47] creatures to be his image Bearer to rule
[1:30:51] see and to have dominion over this and
[1:30:54] over that so and then even as Believers
[1:30:56] friends listen even as Believers we
[1:30:57] dealt with this a lot in our abiding in
[1:31:00] Christ series but because even as
[1:31:01] Believers let me just say it today you
[1:31:03] will never know the power of God and the
[1:31:06] freshness of his Spirit if your primary
[1:31:10] ambition is toward the world rather than
[1:31:12] the word full stop that's it amen I
[1:31:17] could have just read a text quoted you
[1:31:20] that and you could have went home
[1:31:21] benefited
[1:31:24] even as a
[1:31:25] Believer you'll never really know you
[1:31:28] will at least not in its fullness you'll
[1:31:30] never know the power of God operating in
[1:31:33] your life you'll never get to feel the
[1:31:36] daily freshness of his Spirit if your
[1:31:40] primary ambition is toward the world and
[1:31:44] how you can have life and gather
[1:31:47] abundance by your own choices and using
[1:31:49] your own wisdom you're never going to
[1:31:51] know the power of God in your life
[1:31:54] but let me tell you something friends
[1:31:56] that the purpose of God giving us his
[1:31:59] word is is showing us how to survive in
[1:32:04] this Fallen world that's the reason he
[1:32:06] gives it to you you're not here alone
[1:32:08] what do you think Jesus meant when he
[1:32:10] said I'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:32:14] you that's how you ultimately Escape it
[1:32:17] see I can I say it like this I I haven't
[1:32:21] come to the dance to be reformed
[1:32:25] amen
[1:32:27] amen that's that's just a somewhat
[1:32:30] improved version of your former self
[1:32:34] that's not a new birth you're not in the
[1:32:36] game see but the Bible says to you and I
[1:32:41] arise shine arise bride of Christ shine
[1:32:45] why thy light has come good news you
[1:32:48] don't have to wander around in the
[1:32:49] darkness of 40,000 variations of one
[1:32:53] gospel arise and shine thy light has
[1:32:58] come it's come all the way as we said
[1:33:00] last time it's come all the way from
[1:33:01] eternity he stepped all the way from
[1:33:03] eternity to me and you to give us life
[1:33:06] to give us a Revival to be in you to
[1:33:08] live in you to see you come his goal is
[1:33:12] to see you come into where the Lord to
[1:33:16] where the Lord has always desired you to
[1:33:19] be why won't he just leave me alone and
[1:33:22] let me be mediocre cuz that's not the
[1:33:26] vision that's not his vision of you and
[1:33:29] he's bringing you every day into his
[1:33:31] vision see that's
[1:33:33] right we're not here
[1:33:36] merely gather uh understanding and
[1:33:40] rejoice over it I mean we do Rejoice
[1:33:42] over it but but what are you going to do
[1:33:45] about it Amen brother Brandon would say
[1:33:47] it like that he say now you say oh
[1:33:49] brother brandom I sure enjoyed that
[1:33:50] message he said okay thank you sister
[1:33:52] but my question is will you do it see so
[1:33:56] everything we've learned must be brought
[1:33:59] down to the Here and Now of everyday
[1:34:02] life I want to say it again everything
[1:34:04] that we hear everything that we learn of
[1:34:06] God we learn it we hear it we learn it
[1:34:08] to bring it down to as brother brandham
[1:34:10] said you know you don't blow the steam
[1:34:12] out the top you just blow it out the
[1:34:13] whistle Pentecostal babies do that but
[1:34:16] the the trick is to get that Steam down
[1:34:18] into the gears get this locomotive
[1:34:20] moving down the track see so so since
[1:34:25] you know uh since election shows me and
[1:34:27] this and this is this is true election
[1:34:30] shows me that I came from the
[1:34:33] word that being the case then I was born
[1:34:37] into this world to be a part of the word
[1:34:41] already when I got here I was already to
[1:34:45] be a part of the word though I was born
[1:34:47] in the world Amen that's what election
[1:34:50] teaches me therefore true Christianity
[1:34:54] is a power and demonstration of the word
[1:34:59] true Christianity the kind that goes in
[1:35:03] the first resurrection the kind that
[1:35:05] that meets with the sleeping Saints the
[1:35:07] kind that meets Christ in the air the
[1:35:09] kind that sits at a table thousands of
[1:35:11] miles long the kind that comes back with
[1:35:13] Christ in the millennial world that kind
[1:35:15] is the kind that that that that have the
[1:35:18] power and demonstration of the word
[1:35:22] operating in their life
[1:35:24] amen which is to say that my life should
[1:35:27] depict the
[1:35:29] power it should that's what it should
[1:35:33] depict what does it
[1:35:37] depict ask yourself I'm not going to set
[1:35:40] up at a confessional Booth up here and
[1:35:43] I'm asking it rhetorically I don't need
[1:35:44] anybody to jump up and tell me but what
[1:35:47] does your life tell you about you amen
[1:35:50] see amen what is your attitude what is
[1:35:52] your mind what is your what is your
[1:35:54] first thought say well the devil can can
[1:35:56] can bring me a thought so what do you do
[1:35:57] with it right well what am I supposed to
[1:35:59] do with it you think the Bible didn't
[1:36:01] know the devil would give you a thought
[1:36:02] that's why it said take every thought
[1:36:03] contrary to the word and bring it
[1:36:05] subject to the word if you'd bring that
[1:36:08] wrong thought to the Holy Spirit he
[1:36:09] would kill it
[1:36:11] immediately
[1:36:12] see so my life should depict the power
[1:36:15] and demonstration of who I am in Christ
[1:36:19] the power and demonstration of what I
[1:36:22] should be is everything that God wants
[1:36:25] me to be so you remember Paul said that
[1:36:29] I've come I didn't come to you in word
[1:36:32] only amen remember that Paul said I
[1:36:35] didn't come in word only the gospel came
[1:36:38] not in word only now watch but in power
[1:36:42] and
[1:36:43] demonstration now now let me now let me
[1:36:46] just jump on that train and and add some
[1:36:48] add some language to that so the gospel
[1:36:50] came not in word only but in power and
[1:36:54] demonstration and if I borrow from St
[1:36:56] Peter it's a demonstration of the divine
[1:36:59] nature contained in the promises of God
[1:37:03] why do you think he says add to this and
[1:37:04] add to that and add to this and add to
[1:37:06] that because you've been brought in by
[1:37:08] Divine promises that you might be a
[1:37:11] partaker of the Heavenly nature see
[1:37:15] escape the judgments that are to come so
[1:37:18] so so as Paul said i' i' I've not come
[1:37:21] to you in word only but in the power and
[1:37:24] demonstration of the divine nature in
[1:37:26] the word can I say to you today that I
[1:37:28] have come into the world not in election
[1:37:31] only but in the power and demonstration
[1:37:35] of the election that I am a part
[1:37:43] of can I turn for
[1:37:50] home you know in our opening text
[1:37:55] Abraham was really making a solid AR
[1:37:57] Abram was making a solid
[1:38:01] argument when you view it in real
[1:38:04] time I mean he wasn't wrong that he
[1:38:07] still had no seed and God had already
[1:38:10] promised it to him in in Genesis uh 12 I
[1:38:15] may I may I may I don't know how far
[1:38:16] I'll get in this let me just go but he
[1:38:19] he was making a solid
[1:38:22] argument when in real time every can I
[1:38:26] say it like this can I can I just take
[1:38:27] up for Abram just for a moment every
[1:38:30] living
[1:38:32] circumstance testified to the legitimacy
[1:38:36] of his complaint you say you mean it's
[1:38:38] question no I mean it's
[1:38:39] complaint the brother's
[1:38:42] complaining he's asking it a question
[1:38:44] yeah you know humans would do that
[1:38:46] they'll ask you a qu they'll give you a
[1:38:49] complaint veiled in a
[1:38:50] question amen amen
[1:38:55] not going to say
[1:38:57] that on but all all all men know who are
[1:39:01] who's very good at doing
[1:39:06] that but at the end of the day it was
[1:39:08] still reasoning God's
[1:39:10] word it was reasonable
[1:39:14] reasoning can can can y'all give Abram
[1:39:16] some love today it at least it was
[1:39:19] reasonable reasoning he just simply says
[1:39:22] listen you know you can't came to me in
[1:39:24] chapter 12 you promised me this and you
[1:39:26] came to me again in Chapter 13 you
[1:39:28] promis it to me again now here I am in
[1:39:30] chapter 15 and I'm only getting older I
[1:39:32] still don't have any children and I'm
[1:39:34] supposed to be a father of
[1:39:37] Nations and my and my my seed will be
[1:39:40] like the Sands and the dust H how's that
[1:39:44] even going to it's not
[1:39:48] working you know I just think that the
[1:39:50] Lord must have walked him out of his
[1:39:52] prayer closet to go outside and look up
[1:39:54] into the night
[1:39:56] sky tell the
[1:39:58] Stars if thou be able to number them and
[1:40:03] he said unto him and now this is the
[1:40:05] third time he's assuring him so shall
[1:40:08] thy seed
[1:40:10] be now we see that fulfilled over in
[1:40:13] Revelation when you see a number that no
[1:40:15] man could number so you know I I feel
[1:40:17] like I feel like yelling into into
[1:40:19] Genesis 15 and going you made it Abram
[1:40:22] calm down
[1:40:24] I you I know you couldn't but I can read
[1:40:26] the back of the book buddy it's a number
[1:40:28] that no man can number of of All Peoples
[1:40:32] tribes and
[1:40:34] Nations oh there's a number there
[1:40:36] singing Worthy is the
[1:40:38] Lamb
[1:40:42] Hallelujah so in this sense then you
[1:40:45] find
[1:40:46] that can I say it like this and I'm just
[1:40:49] going to have to give it to you the way
[1:40:50] the way my heart felt it God had to take
[1:40:54] him Beyond his mental abilities to
[1:40:57] measure it
[1:40:59] against because that's what we do we're
[1:41:03] constantly we're humans we're constantly
[1:41:06] measuring what's possible Right see
[1:41:08] against the realities of our
[1:41:10] circumstances and God's word promised
[1:41:13] something but our realities don't see
[1:41:14] that and that becomes our
[1:41:17] confession so God literally takes him
[1:41:19] out of his prayer closet walks him out
[1:41:21] and St says look up at a night
[1:41:23] count all them Stars when you get done
[1:41:25] tell me what the number is so he he had
[1:41:28] to take him Beyond his mental abilities
[1:41:31] to measures against he took him he took
[1:41:34] him to an unreasonable comparison to
[1:41:38] stop him from
[1:41:39] reasoning amen and God still does this
[1:41:43] today he will take you into
[1:41:46] circumstances sometimes so dire and so
[1:41:48] unreasonable to get you to stop trusting
[1:41:53] inum reasoning amen amen say that again
[1:41:58] he'll put you in a consequence a
[1:42:00] circumstance so un insensible so
[1:42:03] unreasonable so mindblowing with no hope
[1:42:07] Abraham had no hope to count the Stars
[1:42:11] it was so stupidly impossible and God
[1:42:15] did it that way on purpose and you can
[1:42:17] get you say I'm in a fix I see no way
[1:42:20] out but God already has a way out am he
[1:42:24] has a way for you to keep going
[1:42:26] forward and so he will do that in this
[1:42:29] but you know I I I love it because it
[1:42:31] never came up after Abram got his an an
[1:42:33] H added because H stands for Divinity
[1:42:36] and he added an H to his name and it
[1:42:39] became Abraham and not only did he add
[1:42:41] it to Abraham but he added it to his
[1:42:42] bride Sarah and she went from Sarai to
[1:42:45] Sarah see because and and once God added
[1:42:49] that Abraham added that AG to Abraham
[1:42:51] Abram Abram never made that mistake as
[1:42:53] Abraham see and and that's important God
[1:42:57] had to give him a name change because
[1:42:59] brother brandham taught us that the word
[1:43:01] interpreted now how does he interpret
[1:43:03] his word by bringing it to pass yes amen
[1:43:06] always that's how he interprets it that
[1:43:08] takes all the guess work out Amen
[1:43:11] brother brandham said he he said these
[1:43:13] Sons shall follow them that believe in
[1:43:14] my name they shall cast out Devils it
[1:43:16] happens why do you who who I don't need
[1:43:18] a Greek Theologian to tell me what that
[1:43:20] means I can see what it means these sign
[1:43:23] shall follow them that believe I see
[1:43:25] that happening see and so so so we
[1:43:29] realize that that the word
[1:43:32] interpreted is
[1:43:34] itself a
[1:43:36] manifestation of the name of God so when
[1:43:40] God is interpreting his word through
[1:43:42] your willing
[1:43:44] compliance you become an image bearer of
[1:43:47] his
[1:43:49] name and he values his name even above
[1:43:52] his word yes see I'm sorry his word
[1:43:55] above his name you become you become a a
[1:43:57] manifestation of his word and he values
[1:44:00] his word above his name and we realize
[1:44:03] that that of course that that makes
[1:44:05] sense because God uses different names
[1:44:08] his names change and evolve as according
[1:44:10] to what he's doing but his word never
[1:44:12] changes see so so so we find that he
[1:44:16] interprets his word by bringing it to
[1:44:18] pass in our lives and this is exactly
[1:44:21] why the di recognizing that the name of
[1:44:26] God was Jesus amen it that's why it's so
[1:44:31] important uh for that early church and
[1:44:34] it's it's equally important in the
[1:44:36] restoration of the brid tree we had to
[1:44:39] get a revelation of his name and we
[1:44:42] found out he wasn't a second God he was
[1:44:45] the god and that's why the Book of
[1:44:47] Revelation which is the bride's book at
[1:44:49] the end time it starts out with the
[1:44:52] revelation of of Jesus Christ I'm here
[1:44:55] to tell you when you get a revelation of
[1:44:57] Jesus Christ which you cannot get
[1:44:59] outside of a new birth it's cut off it's
[1:45:01] in a mystery it's called The Mystery of
[1:45:03] redemption but God rich in Mercy reveals
[1:45:07] not Doctrine not teaching he reveals
[1:45:11] himself and you get then you get a Next
[1:45:13] Level when you abide in him because then
[1:45:15] you start looking like him hallelujah
[1:45:19] hallelujah and you begin to believe and
[1:45:22] the more you become like him the more
[1:45:23] you believe his word and the cycle
[1:45:25] continues to compound like compound
[1:45:29] interest the complete mystery of the
[1:45:31] godhead see because as you've heard me
[1:45:35] say before the the problem with the with
[1:45:39] the formula of the trinitarians is it
[1:45:42] chops God into three
[1:45:44] persons say well then the Oneness have
[1:45:46] it no the problem with the formula of
[1:45:49] the Oneness is they see Jesus
[1:45:51] only they don't see his body his church
[1:45:56] his bride which is a direct quote of
[1:45:58] prophet part of God's
[1:46:01] godhead because why you're an expression
[1:46:05] of him you're carrying forth the word of
[1:46:07] God no wonder the devil fears you when
[1:46:10] any son or daughter of God in faith puts
[1:46:13] the word of God on their lips and speak
[1:46:15] it that's the same as deity speaking
[1:46:18] what are you afraid of friends why do
[1:46:20] you keep letting the devil push you
[1:46:21] around knowing now who you
[1:46:27] areow just as God would not allow Abram
[1:46:30] to speak a wrong confession neither are
[1:46:33] the children of Abraham allowed to
[1:46:36] confess uh anything that is contrary to
[1:46:40] what the word declares will you accept
[1:46:42] that commission today say I will not
[1:46:45] confess anything contrary to what the
[1:46:48] word
[1:46:49] declares the confession of her lips
[1:46:53] that she is Mrs Jesus Christ is a key
[1:46:59] component in your
[1:47:01] Victory but
[1:47:07] sometimes
[1:47:09] sometimes every living
[1:47:13] circumstance in our minds makes that
[1:47:17] seem
[1:47:20] impossible I am the he was the beginning
[1:47:26] of the creation of God I am the
[1:47:29] continuation uh me do you know you
[1:47:33] obviously don't know me like I know
[1:47:36] me
[1:47:38] me I I'm to put his word on my lips and
[1:47:41] it's just like he said it amen me I I'm
[1:47:45] supposed to walk forward in faith like
[1:47:47] that doubting nothing fearing nothing
[1:47:50] that that if I say to this mountain be
[1:47:52] moved and don't doubt it'll happen
[1:47:56] me see and so we find that to to be able
[1:48:01] to say that I am part of his godhead
[1:48:03] that I am Ms Jesus Christ that I am that
[1:48:06] I am part of the revelation of the
[1:48:10] mystery and a revelation of a mystery
[1:48:13] didn't come it's not coming to the world
[1:48:16] Listen hear me I'm closing it's not a
[1:48:18] revelation coming to the world because a
[1:48:21] preacher preached it or somebody taught
[1:48:22] it from the Bible they already don't
[1:48:25] believe it a prophet taught it to them
[1:48:27] for 33 years and proved it with a pillar
[1:48:29] of fire they're not going to believe
[1:48:31] anybody saying it what they'll believe
[1:48:33] is when you can be it that's how you'll
[1:48:36] persuade your family that's how you
[1:48:38] persuade the gainsayer that's how you
[1:48:40] bring somebody to Christ you live it you
[1:48:44] become it you are it when they meet
[1:48:47] Christ when they meet you they've met
[1:48:48] Christ
[1:48:53] sometimes when we get like
[1:48:56] Abram we start complaining about the our
[1:49:00] flesh and the one born in our house let
[1:49:01] me tell you something friends let me
[1:49:03] remind you as I close right here Anthony
[1:49:05] bring your
[1:49:07] team just like
[1:49:10] Abram I got one born in my
[1:49:14] house I'm chained to a dead man I'm
[1:49:17] carrying him
[1:49:19] around and it's it's the job it's my job
[1:49:23] to keep this flesh under the control I
[1:49:28] am the image bearer of God and it is I
[1:49:34] am
[1:49:35] Commissioned I Am commissioned just like
[1:49:38] in Genesis that I am to rule and have
[1:49:42] authority over this flesh over the world
[1:49:47] over sin and over the devil that's right
[1:49:50] stand to your feet brother brandham said
[1:49:53] it like this I can't give it to you any
[1:49:55] pler than the way a prophet said
[1:49:57] it in the message as I was with
[1:50:02] Moses he said speaking of Servants of
[1:50:06] God which we all are this is not just
[1:50:09] five-fold
[1:50:11] preachers this is Holy Ghost God's holy
[1:50:13] ghost filled
[1:50:14] family and with an extra measure of
[1:50:17] responsibility on
[1:50:19] ministers that we are to stand in the
[1:50:23] steps of Jesus Christ and perform his
[1:50:27] Works amen you have no idea how many
[1:50:31] times over the years when you come to
[1:50:33] this Altar and you've got a prayer
[1:50:35] request that I am powerless I can't fix
[1:50:38] it for you I would do it if I could I
[1:50:41] would heal you if I could brother Ram
[1:50:42] said what kind of person would I be if
[1:50:44] somebody came up sick and I refused to
[1:50:46] heal them he said I can't heal you he
[1:50:48] said but Jesus has already healed you
[1:50:52] people that need Deliverance I can't
[1:50:53] give them Deliverance people that have
[1:50:55] needs I can't grant that need whatever's
[1:50:57] in my power I try to Grant it and
[1:50:59] sometimes I get in the way granting
[1:51:01] it amen helping people out of a
[1:51:05] situation God got them in and and I've
[1:51:08] only made the situation worse come on
[1:51:09] parents we know that about our kids
[1:51:12] don't we if you if you've raised
[1:51:13] teenagers into adulthood you certainly
[1:51:15] know that sometimes with good intentions
[1:51:18] you just get in God's way and you bail
[1:51:20] them out I remember I remember I used to
[1:51:22] beg God and Lord save my brother save my
[1:51:25] brother please save him save him Lord
[1:51:26] save him and the Lord said to me one day
[1:51:29] just as clear as a bell said how can I
[1:51:30] save him if you keep saving
[1:51:35] him I I I'm I felt like I am now silent
[1:51:39] I couldn't even say anything the Lord so
[1:51:42] had my number and I knew wow the Lord
[1:51:47] just found me
[1:51:49] out I want to have you bow your heads
[1:51:52] over the building
[1:51:56] today I want to pray for
[1:52:00] you I happen to know being a human
[1:52:05] being that things that were said today
[1:52:08] and speaking of Abram and the things he
[1:52:12] was doing and the situation and how God
[1:52:14] dealt with
[1:52:15] him and I know that being a human being
[1:52:19] with you we all have found ourselves at
[1:52:23] times like
[1:52:26] Abram and sometimes we
[1:52:29] [Music]
[1:52:33] wonder Lord Lord fix this circumstance
[1:52:37] fix this situation and you're you're
[1:52:40] wondering why he won't do it and you're
[1:52:41] unaware that he's put you in that
[1:52:43] circumstance to fix
[1:52:46] you deliverance from the circumstance by
[1:52:49] a Divine Miracle is not the solution you
[1:52:51] need the solution you need sometimes
[1:52:55] friends you say well why does God speak
[1:52:58] like that and then and then sometimes he
[1:53:00] won't even speak to you at
[1:53:02] all now I know that happens to you cuz
[1:53:05] it happens to me sometimes he won't even
[1:53:08] speak to you at all you know why because
[1:53:11] he's already told you all he's going to
[1:53:14] say to you in his word on that subject
[1:53:18] and until you obey that word don't look
[1:53:21] for an audible voice Voice or any
[1:53:23] voice he's saying child I've already
[1:53:26] spoken to you about this in my word I
[1:53:30] compel you to be my image Bearer in this
[1:53:34] matter and if you'll agree to that God
[1:53:37] will start helping
[1:53:39] you I know that's true and I'm going to
[1:53:42] I'll I'll make it easy and I'll destroy
[1:53:44] the awkwardness I'll just raise up both
[1:53:46] my hands first how many feel like that
[1:53:47] at
[1:53:48] times oh look at those hands everywhere
[1:53:51] Lord you see see those hands they're up
[1:53:53] all over the building Lord I'm quite
[1:53:55] sure that out across the airwaves people
[1:53:57] are raising up their hands in honest
[1:54:00] confession Lord yes you've promised it
[1:54:02] to us many times we see the word we know
[1:54:05] what you said so did Abram he couldn't
[1:54:07] deny that you had already told it to him
[1:54:09] in chapter 12 you had already told it to
[1:54:11] him again in Chapter 13 what is he doing
[1:54:15] coming a third time around still
[1:54:17] complaining and doubting and questioning
[1:54:19] why why is this why is that and Lord you
[1:54:23] just simply rather than
[1:54:26] just rather than explain it all to him
[1:54:28] he couldn't know what we know today I
[1:54:31] happen because I can read the book of
[1:54:32] Revelation I know it all turned out fine
[1:54:35] I know it all came out okay Abram you'll
[1:54:37] be okay buddy don't worry you'll be okay
[1:54:41] but he couldn't know that Lord at the
[1:54:42] time you you weren't you that was in the
[1:54:45] early Genesis days you hadn't revealed
[1:54:47] all of it you'd only told him this is
[1:54:50] what's going to happen I'm going to I'm
[1:54:52] going to do it I'm going to do it
[1:54:54] doesn't even based on you it's what I'm
[1:54:56] telling you I've already accomplished
[1:54:57] and this is what's going to happen well
[1:54:59] then Lord why is my circumstance like it
[1:55:01] is come out here Abram get get up get
[1:55:04] out of your prayer closet come outside
[1:55:06] come here son lord it's dark come out
[1:55:09] here look up Lord I've looked up a
[1:55:12] thousand times look up differently this
[1:55:14] time what do you want me to do Lord
[1:55:16] count those stars and give me the number
[1:55:19] Lord that's impossible then if if you
[1:55:21] think that that's impossible then stop
[1:55:23] thinking then stop looking at my promise
[1:55:26] and think I can't bring it to pass cuz
[1:55:28] Abram I know exactly how many stars are
[1:55:31] up there I actually built them and hung
[1:55:34] them

[1:55:52] you to be willing to rule and to oversee
[1:55:56] all of the flourishing life that I build

[1:56:57] further and
[1:56:59] further they don't realize they're
[1:57:01] they're they're taking their cues from
[1:57:03] the Tree of knowledge they don't realize
[1:57:04] it they wouldn't do it if they did and
[1:57:07] if and if they were here in church today
