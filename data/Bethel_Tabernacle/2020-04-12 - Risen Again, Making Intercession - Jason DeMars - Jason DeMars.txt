so glad to be in the house of the Lord and my goodness I just miss everyone so much and on the one hand it sure doesn't feel like Easter on the other hand shouldn't every day feel like Easter amen because we're risen and walking in newness of life in Christ and so I'm so excited he is risen he's the same yesterday today and forever his mighty works are still going forth throughout all the earth we might be meeting in just small groups or there's churches that are just simply doing zoom meetings all around the world or Facebook live or however they're doing it but people are coming together and God is not limited by our location he's he's everywhere he's dwelling in the heart of every believer and we we can know him outside of a church building and he moves in a supernatural way outside of a church building and we're discovering that again and people are they're still healings going forth there's still supernatural move of the Spirit going forth in people's lives and oh my goodness it's just a wonderful hour to be alive we can be frustrated we can study about all the conspiracy theories we can look in and see and say oh the government should have done this or should have done that and that's that's alright thank the Lord we can still speak about speak against the government in this country but there's places where you can't do that so we can disagree with what a path and what approach to the government local government federal government has taken that's alright but the thing it is not so much that we need to be thinking about that it's we need to be thinking keeping our eyes and our focus on Christ in this hour and what a fitting time for all these things that happen to remind us in today Christ is risen he's on the throne and he's the same yesterday today and forever amen I just want to pray father we love you so much we're so thankful Lord for this day Lord though every Sunday we honor the resurrection to for this day to just take a special time to think about what the resurrection has done for us Lord and there's many many things we could speak about regarding that Lord and I just have something specific in my heart to talk about regarding that Lord one aspects of that Lord but believe it's an important subject for this our Lord and I don't even pretend to understand everything their Lord but we want to just continue walking in the light every step Lord and you're doing that with each believer and you're doing that in each Minister that's called to the fivefold ministry or you're teaching us you're leading us you're guiding us and it's doing it Lord for your glory for the equipping of the Saints for the building up Lord of their lives of their faith Lord none of us exist for ourselves so Lord let us each one get ourselves out of the way Lord we just asked for a supernatural spirit of peace in every home that's tuning in now we know how it goes Lord with little kids and and things it's it's not easy to sit in your comfortable home where the kids play and do things on a daily basis and now they have to sit down and be quiet and watch watch the service Lord I pray that you'd help each mother each father each child Lord just calm their spirits father and may your presence come may we be able to tune in and focus Lord we know that with social media with with the devices that we have sometimes it's it doesn't lend itself to really focusing lord help us to overcome Lord our location our device how we're watching this Lord and really be able to get in tune with the Spirit of God we need you Lord we just want to commit ourselves to you in Jesus name Amen amen musicians I'm just gonna go ahead and dismiss you I'm going to take a few minutes to lay the groundwork and get to my scripture so I'm not sure if we got the PowerPoint up there but my subject is risen again making intercession and so I just want to kind of lay the groundwork for this as we go into it I know it can sometimes be a controversial subject talking about the mercy seat and and the mediator ship of Jesus Christ and it shouldn't be but because of misunderstandings on things that sometimes becomes that I'm not here to solve everybody's problem I'm not here to bring you the definitive definitive answer on this subject I don't I'm not qualified to do that I don't believe I am I consider this that the Lord has given me another step in my personal walk and revelation and understanding this is maybe just one step part of that and I it's been a blessing in my life pray pray it's a blessing in your life I consider that there's much more to learn about this I don't believe that there is more revelation to come to us in the sense that there's gonna be another messenger or that brother Branham is gonna return to bring us more revelation but I do believe there's more revelation for us contained inside of the message that God delivered and I believe that the Lord is gonna place that in the scripture that's what he that's what he always does you know he's gonna give us the Lord will give us a balanced understanding so what often happens too often happens is I you go through it all the time when you have online ministry you have one side they want to take one aspect of it and then they then there's the other aspect of it and they say let's let's have a fight we fight with both aspects and I want to say yes that's that's right but it's also written Jesus did the same thing there's a way to place these things in order and in pop proper perspective in the message in the scripture without saying I'm throwing this away now understand there's a progression there's a progressive revelation that brother Branham had there's a process that he had where he even said I was wrong about this subject in the past and so I'm just trying to kind of lay the foundation this is a little thing that the Lord helped me with I'm not trying to make a grand revelation out of it I just believe I believe there's a scriptural point here that can be a blessing to us in this hour where we're we're we're thinking about the resurrection of Jesus Christ so with that that said I'm gonna go to my opening scripture Romans 8:30 three and thirty four who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died hey rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us Amen may the Lord had the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so our security from condemnation that's what this is speaking about is in the fact that jesus christ's rose from the dead and is at the right hand of god making intercession for us so it starts out who can lay anything to the charge of who is gonna come before god's court and make a charge against the elect who can do it if it's God that justifies who is gonna supersede his decision Hafiz the question is obvious no one or the answer is obvious it's no one who is the one that condemns so who is going to stand and say I bring charges and I'm going to condemn this person before God's court of law Paul answers it's Christ that died yay rather that is risen again who's even at the right hand of God who also makes intercession for us a crucial part why was Jesus raised from the dead for what purpose what how does that impact you and me think about that for a minute if he doesn't raise from the dead he cannot make intercession for us he cannot present himself before God and say Here I am the intercessor the representative of all the elect of all the ages he can't do that so God raises him from the dead and brings him there and he's at the right hand of God making intercession for us thank you Jesus hebrews chapter 7 verse 22 through 25 by so much was Jesus made a surety of a better Testament and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man because he continued with ever hath an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them he ever lives for what purpose to what end why does he ever live why was he raised from the dead to make intercession for them thank you lord so there's lots of terms in these verses that I really want to look at and pay attention to and dig into on a deeper level first one is surety there's the word Testament or covenant and there's intercession all these terms are critically important when we're understanding this topic scripturally so first one we have is surety a surety means a person who takes responsibility for another's performance or an undertaking for example their appearing in court or the payment of a debt so Jesus has become the surety of a better Testament or covenant okay so a better one so he's referring back to the Old Testament the Old Covenant and he's saying it's a better one we'll talk more about that as we go forward it this is this one is improved this one is new and it's improved and the problem was not with the one who started the Covenant I'm getting ahead of myself again the problem was not with God this makes it a better covenant because it takes it out of our hands it puts it back in the hands of God and then God says you know what I can't take you directly if I take you directly you will fail again I'm not gonna not gonna make this covenant directly with you why because you'll fail you proved before that you will fail so he's gonna take a surety so when when you take a surety you're you're saying I want someone to guarantee this for me so a young person wants to go in and I definitely don't ever suggest doing this being a cosigner but but parents will will come and they'll take take a child in and become a cosigner for the loan what happens in that situation you are responsible for that loan well I'm just a cosigner you are responsible for that loan if the your child does not pay it it will impact you and so here in this situation God says you know what I'm just gonna bypass you guys cuz you will fail I'm gonna make a covenant and I'm gonna make a covenant with Jesus Christ because I know he's perfect I know he's sinless I know he will not fail and he will stand in your place he'll pay your debt he will appear in court for you so when we're called and before God and in the court of heaven who's who's gonna come Jason to Mars know Jesus Christ is gonna appear in court for Jason to Mars Jason to Mars can stand and watch the proceedings God says okay Jason to Mars I want to call you up to judge you and I will say will you I'm just gonna stay here go ahead and up rise as my attorney and he says I'll I'll pay the debt I stand as his representative and God says it's finished if you're perfect he's perfect there's no debt owed it's it's complete so that's God made a covenant with us with Christ as the guarantor of that covenant what a good deal what a good deal I'm gonna take that deal Hebrews 8:6 through ten but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises for if that first covenant you see why it's better you understand it's better they're better promises amen for if that first covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second ooh is Paul saying that the God that God who made a covenant made a mistake well no for verse eight for finding fault with them he didn't find fault with himself he said I found there's a Fault in this covenant and it's you because what is a covenant it's a green agreement between two parties so there's a problem in the Covenant the problem is you he saith behold the days come saith the Lord when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their minds and write them in their hearts and i will be a god be to them a god and they shall be my people so christ was our surety he wasn't god's surety god is perfectly faithful God is completely righteous he always fulfills his word he needs no surety however you and I do as I was just talking about Christ is our surety Christ as our guarantor he takes responsibility for our performance for our perfor how we live how we act the way the way we sin the way we disbelieve God's Word and in times that we have struggles in our lives where we fall off the the correct path or we make the choices that are against God's Word Christ says I take responsibility for that I stand in their place but not only do I stand and stand in their place I'm gonna work in their lives I'm gonna change them I'm gonna transform them I'm gonna put the law of God in their hearts and in their minds I'm gonna write the word in their hearts why so they have a knowledge know so that they have a life the life of God lived through them so he takes the responsibility for our performance he takes our place in the divine court of law and he pays our debt the fault was in us the fault was in man for the Old Covenant so he makes a new covenant he makes that agreement between two parties again the agreement is between God and the elect but he doesn't deal with us directly now think about a covenant the new covenant what is the new covenant well really it's the it's the shedding of Christ's blood the application of that through the baptism of the Holy Ghost right so this is God's covenant he puts his Spirit within us and he writes the word and he transforms us and that is how the blood works within us there's no literal blood anymore that took place at Calvary that was finished Christ was resurrected with a new body he went he ascended he presented himself before the Father and say here's here is the sacrifice and-and-and-and and then he is the intercessor so he stands in the presence of God and he's our representative in heaven and then he has that high priest is interceding for us and we remember in the script in the book of Hebrews he can go and read it he's not offering continual sacrifices it's not necessary he offered one perfect sacrifice once for all of us and his literal body is in heaven and he's literally there interceding for us you know in intercession that word means the action of intervening for someone else so he's intervening for us he ever lives to make intercession for us so that that life that he lives there he stands there and any intervenes for us and it also says he's the mediator of a better covenant first Timothy two were five and six for there's one God and one mediator between God and men the man Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time a mediator is a person who stands between two parties involved in a conflict so yes two parties were involved in a conflict there was a conflict between God and us we were God's enemies let's read the scripture on that you say well I was elect that was never his enemy well let's read the scripture Colossians 1 21 and 22 and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and Unruh provable in his sight we were enemies we were a lien ated from God and we needed Christ to stand in our place to represent us before God so that there could be a reconciliate er makes peace through the blood of his cross first Corinthians 15 20 through 22 but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive amen so that's the that's the elected he is our head Adam was the was that was our head to start with and he by sin fell and he he he brought death on the whole human race and so he brings death to the whole human race Christ brings life to the whole human race and he is our representative and he stands there and he takes he takes it all every every punishment that we deserved he took it every the wrath of God that was supposed to be poured upon us he took it and then through his resurrection we were in him we were his bride we are his bride but we were his bride then too why because we were chosen in Christ in his mind in the mind of God before the foundation of the world when he went to the cross we went with him when he was buried we were buried with him when he rose up we rose up with him we're made alive in him and so brother Branham says this in the sixth seal you cannot let me go forward here yeah you cannot intercessor limp unless there is blood there yes sir there's one mediator between God and man and that's Christ Jesus that's what the scripture says there he stands until the last soul has been redeemed and then he comes forth to claim what he has that's he until that last soul has been redeemed he will stand and intercede he's the mediator of a better covenant I have a question is the new covenant still in effect or did it be passed to another covenant if we passed another covenant what Scripture do you have for it as I understand in the dispensations in the scripture you have the church age dispensation and then after that is completed God turns and begins to deal with the Jews through the two witnesses and he calls the 144,000 and they theirs they received the seal of God so they are they become a part of the New Covenant but he stops dealing with the Gentile bride and he turns to begin to deal with the Jews and that's that's something separate that God is doing for for Israel and yet they do receive the Holy Ghost and so Christ has to stand there as an intercessor as he reveals himself it's they say who are these who where'd you get these scars from where who pierced your hands who pierced your feet out with I got it in the house of my friends and so is he interceding for the Jews then or does he stop interceding sometime long before he deals with the Jews you you answer it I I know what I believe now Christ is not continually offering his blood upon the mercy seat he's not taking a knife and dropping blood that's not what it's that's not what his intercessory work is about he shed his blood the work is finished it was completed at Calvary the blood has done its work has accomplished its purpose but then he has to make intercession for us he has to stand in our place the covenant that he made it's still in effect he's the guarantor he continues to be the guarantor he continues to be the surety and until every elected one is saved completely saved washed and given the Spirit of God to write the word upon their heart as we sin as we make our confession to God he ever lives to make intercession for us he's a go-between by virtue of his life he's resurrected and this is our guarantee of forgiveness and resurrection both it's like our guarantee of our forgiveness but also our resurrection our own resurrection both in the inner man and the outer man and the culmination of Christ's work as a mediator I believe is to take and claim the book of Redemption I didn't say the end of it I said the culmination of all that he's done and then he takes the book he takes that book of redemption he opens the seven seals now I want you to look and see what brother Branham said yeah yeah The Voice is a thunder the voice came from where from the throne where the lamb had just left as intercessor now he is standing here to take his position in his claims but that thunder came from the inside of the throne thundered out and the lamb was standing out there the thunder where the lamb had left left the father's throne to go to take his own throne glory now don't miss it friends we all know as Christians that God swore to David that he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne and give him an everlasting Kingdom here on the earth he did it and Jesus said he that overcomes the antichrist and all the things of the world shall sit with me in my throne as i have overcome and have sat down on my Father's throne amen amen so again the process he's going to rise up from his mediators the throne and his Father's throne and he's gonna go and take his own throne seems complicated but not really what where is his Father's throne that's in heaven that's the that's the very throne of God that's where Christ is seated and in process of time what does he do he has three different offices Christ has he's a prophet he's a priest and he's also a king so when he makes the transition from priest to King he rises up and he takes his throne when he becomes king okay so it's it's if you look there's always an hour of transition between the offices read John chapter 17 look at that it's called the high priestly prayer of Jesus Christ he begins interceding but I want you to notice is he did he stop being a prophet no he was still a prophet he even had things where he foretold things after that where he told the secrets of the heart after that but there was an hour of transition where he was going to the cross and becoming our intercessor and to be the priest that is our mediator standing as our surety so there was a transition and even now there's a transition between offices he's claiming his bride he's joining in an invisible union with his bride there's something today we understand that's unique you know he's took the book he broke the seals the mighty angel came down put his foot on the land on the sea with an open book he cries with the loud voice seven thunders out of their voices and the seventh angel finishes that mystery it's an hour of transition brother Branham says we're turning a corner it doesn't he doesn't say well that is over with it's done and now we're on another thing but he says we're turning a corner not we've turned a corner we're turning a corner in the sermon proving his word brother Branham says now that that's a that's a big word predestinate but we all know that it's the truth we absolutely know that the infinite God predestinated all things by foreknowledge before the foundation of the world even the lamb was slain and every name that would ever be on the book was put on the book before the book was ever written now how many knows that's true and Jesus came to redeem those that were in the book in the Bible the lamb came from behind the curtain and taken the book and opened the seals that it was sealed with for he came to claim all he has redeemed he's the intercessor now an intercessor making intercession for those he has redeemed all whose names was written on the Lamb's Book of Life is redeemed so notice what he said he said he came he taken the book and open the seals that it was sealed with for he claimed he came to claim all he had redeemed next next sentence what does he say he's the intercessor now he didn't just leave it at he's the intercessor so that we could be open to interpretation he what you know what would he maybe he meant he was the intercessor in the past he's the intercessor now an intercessor making intercessions for those who he has redeemed so again redemption Christ paid the price at Calvary he has to make the claim the first start of making the claim is taking the book the second part of finishing that claim is actually physically descending from heaven leaving that throne descending from heaven meeting us in the air resurrected raptured Saints will meet the literal physical body of Jesus Christ in the air and we'll go to the marriage supper and then he'll turn and make himself known to the Jews so brother Branham had no problem saying the seals are open he broke the seals and saying he's an intercessor now it's a process he takes them he took the book in 1963 he broke the seals in 1963 he's still interceding for us he's still a high priest that can be touched by the feeling you can do these searches you could see them yourself and did he did he again did he take his Millennial throne I know some people claim that but he hasn't taken his millennial throne he will literally do it literally on this earth from the literal City of Jerusalem he hasn't done that yet so he took the book he broke the seals brother Branham I have 17 pages because some people were saying only six seals rope I have 17 pages of quotes brother Branham speaking about seven seals are opened so they're opened and he's interceding for us why because the New Covenant is still in effect do you have a new covenant without a mediator of the Covenant that's crazy where is the body of Jesus Christ did he's still in heaven the literal physical body of course we understand the body of Christ is the bride all right Hebrews 9 23 and 24 this was something that really struck me because it it matters where Jesus Christ is I'm not I'm not talking about the spirit of Jesus Christ we understand that he's here with us now I'm talking about that literal body the man Christ Jesus who's our mediator where is he because that will tell us what stage were at it was therefore at Hebrews 9 23 and 24 it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us so where is he appearing for us well he's appeared in spirit form here well we're not talking about pure spirit form we're talking about the man Christ Jesus where is he is he on some spiritual throne in Jerusalem ruling over some ridiculous Millenium no no he's literally still in heaven in the presence of God for us he didn't enter the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true he's in heaven itself to appear in the presence of God he's standing for us he's standing for me that's my surety if he's not standing for me I'm completely lost he stands there for me he's still in heaven however we understand he did take the book he started his claim for his bride to take us that process has begun from the indictment and I'm looking at my time here from the sermon the indictment now in Christ is God's provided Lamb notice how appropriate was now brothers and sisters I just want to say I was so nervous when the Lord spoke to my heart that I was supposed to speak on this subject because this this could be just such a quagmire to wait into and I I don't want to wait into a quagmire I'd rather have a brother Jason wait wait into a quagmire and I'll just support him in it but the law I know when the Lord speaks to my heart I'm growing enough to the place where I say don't I'm not gonna resist that as you in the past usually I had another sermon prepared and this one there and I just walk up to the pulpit feeling terrible and saying okay I'm gonna preach on this but I'm sure it's gonna be terrible yes I have no confidence in myself and that's not a bad thing I have confidence in Him who called me and he'll take care he'll take care of everything but I want to be careful in how I'm communicating this because I don't want to go I'm trying to stay just as balanced as I can not to take one side and run like crazy or another side and run like crazy let's say let's say Amen to both sides so this is from the indictment now and Christ is God's provided lamb notice how appropriate was now showing that all that that Jerusalem was ceasing when it was an infected tell that hour the blood of the lamb was alright until that day but now at the crucifixion it changes the old system is done there's a new one and the lamb was at the sacrifice the land the sacrificial lamb was on the grounds they were condemning and doing the very thing there they they had to do that's right God be blessed for seeing this wonderful heavenly light in this day because the churches is doing the same thing today until the hour that organization organization religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing Christ's word from then on comes the word and the word only from the old Paschal Lamb passed away in Christ become our lamb at the day of the crucifixion and the day that the denomination crucified the Word of God and accepted a Creed in the stead of the word that's the day the word come into a full effect that's just been recently so is the blood of Jesus Christ no longer in effect and we now have a bloodless faith it also says it is also written and we have to take that also written we don't just take this quote and say the rest of what he said just throw it out we can't do that because over and over again he speaks about the blood of Christ after this quote and so there then that means there's we don't dismiss this one either there's a way to look at both sides and I'm not saying I have the perfect way but I I feel like there's more but I feel like the Lord starting something so invisible Union of the Bride of Christ your first wedding was annulled it was you've never done it in the first place because there's only one thing could do it that would be God come down himself and took your place in the form of the Son of God Jesus Christ and wash you by the water of the washing of the water by the word the word not the denomination the word washed you but if you won't stand in the water of the word how are you going to be washed you're still as spotted as Eve was oh dear now look at this this is what he sings oh dear dying lamb thy precious precious blood shall never lose its power till all the Ransom church of god be saved to sin no more what is sin sin his unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in God which is the word pure an adult Oh hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready think your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word the word become blood the word bled for you and you are washed in the bleeding word the word bleeding the life of God in the word and the word was blood for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleaned and sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and makes your mind and heart stayed on God and His Word so that's that's what he said it goes from the blood to the word and the word comes into a full effect and that was just recently and he said were washed by the water of the bleeding word so the blood is connected to the word on one sense it always was it always was in another sense there has to be a restoration of the original faith and that has to be presented to the church world so if you're gonna be washed by the water of the word if you have an imperfect word a perverted word can you truly receive that spotless without spot or wrinkle he's gonna present a bride to himself a church without spot or wrinkle and so that church needs to be washed by the Paul says calls it washed by the water of the word and so it's gonna have to be a perfect restored word to make a perfect spotless bride and so that word is restored and then it's presented and guess what happened it got crucified so now God looks at things differently and as you read brother branham's message he begins to make a transition so here we have in the first seal notice these type the reason they die out they go through the purging of trial of the tribulation because they're not actually under the blood they claim they are but they're not how can they go through a trial to purify them when there is when the bleach blood of Jesus Christ takes every symptom of sin and stuff away from you and you're already dead and your life is hidden him through God and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost what are you going to be judged for where are you going to get your purification what do you have to be purified from when you're perfectly in Christ sinless what's the judgment for but it's the sleeping bunch that then people can't make out so he says that group that that group the the the foolish virgin in this place he says they're not under the blood in this Plitt in this place he says that and so you see when when and we're getting into many details but when the message is presented and if the people reject it what happens it it goes from the blood to the word doesn't dissing all the blood it never can write but what it does is now God applying that blood is only through the restored word upon the bride so god changing changing turning corners there and of course that gets into another thing and there's something to balance out even with that with those things as well but just to understand these are the things that the prophets said regarding this subject and we don't want to take one and take the other and and and and get get ourselves in a fight within ourselves the blood is applied to the bride via the perfect restored word during a dispensational transition there's a transition period time that's happening that's taking place we're not just we're not in an eighth age is there's only seven Church ages there's not eight straight changes we're in the seventh church age but brother Branham says within the seventh search age you have the Pentecostal age and you have the bride age that's within Laodicea that time period the seventh church age there's a bride age why because there's a trick there's a calling of the bride within the seventh church age Christ has put on the outside and now he begins to call and say come commons and and and feast with me and we'll be joined and we'll be made one and so that's that transition period of time from Christ as the mystery of God revealed and the body must follow the head as the wife follows the husband husband being that Adam was not deceived he walked out with Eve Eve was deceived she was in the transgression or the entire resurrection of the whole body would come for that the day of the Lord Jesus when he come forth at the grave but he had to redeem her which is his body she had to be be redeemed in order to come to him do you see it oh my see it couldn't have happened then listen to what he says it couldn't have happened then when Jesus died and was raised from the dead it couldn't have happened then the redemption is going on look look at his next phrase now you see the seals the redemptions going on now now you see the seals when he's in his mediatorial work back they're redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him and all that all that's in that he come forth for the book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb and here he is today in his word manifesting the same thing that he did there she can't recognize another headship no sir there's nobody no-nothing she recognizes one headship headship that's Christ and Christ is the word oh my I love that yes sir as the head was took up from the grave so must his body follow him into Eden therefore the body cannot recognize any other headship but the headship of the word wow there's so much there but I just wanted to capture that one spot the redemption is going on now now do you see the seals it's going on he doesn't say it's over with it's done Mercy's over he's off the mercy seat there's no more no he doesn't say that he says it's going on there's a transition from one dispensation to another there's a preparation in stee when he opened those seven seals a transition began it isn't as though okay 1963 happened we cut it off and start something new you can't find that in what brother Branham taught you don't see that anywhere but you can definitely see that there's a there's something very distinct happening Christ has descended in spirit form with an open book to reveal that open book to us that content to produce rapturing faith well if rapturing faith is in the message why are you still here because rapturing faith has to go from the message that was preached to us to have its effect inside of us he said the church is starting to get the message only thing left is what do they need to do they need to lay in the presence of the son to ripen so I just want to bring it kind of to a not a full conclusion because I imagine there's there's more that I'd like to cover but musicians if you would would come up and cry still stands in the presence of God for us he still remains our surety our guarantor our mediator his blood is still in effect but it comes via the fully restored word he took the seventh sealed book and he opened it not he didn't open six seals and wait 50 60 years to open the seventh seal he's opened the whole thing to us because brother Branham said again and again it's become a new book to me well if it's still closed it can't be a new book it has to be completely open that mighty angel came down what did he have in his hand open book seven thunders out of their voices brother Brandon brought that revelation to us to finish the mystery of God but then there's one step further now we have to take the book and eat the book and prophesy again not a new prophecy but to say what he said he's in the process of changing Thrones he hasn't changed Thrones yet but he's in the process of doing it and he will do it but that process has started when he opened the seals and it will be completed when he descends with his bride to literal Jerusalem Redemption is going on now there's a final stage of redemption we didn't get to the scripture but in first Peter I think it's one verse five that there's a salvation that's ready to be revealed at the last time they will probably talk about that next time but Redemption is going on now there's a salvation that's going on right now something distinct from the cross something that's too to wash us by the water of the word mercy is still in effect because the mediator stands and mediates for us he's in the presence of God for us amen let's pray gracious father were so thankful that you raised up the Lord Jesus and that you'll raise us up also Lord and he stands as the guarantee of that before you how grateful Lord we should be lord I pray that the the presence of your Holy Spirit would be upon us continually Lord in this hour Lord of confusion Lord just settle each of our spirits Lord that we might have clarity and understanding father we love you help us not to run to and fro and just even in our mind in our own homes we run to and fro mentally going here going there and it just robs our peace Lord may the peace which passes all understanding be upon everyone listening in may we seek your face may we enter into that closet Lord and seek you in secret that you might manifest the answer openly Lord we commit ourselves to you father we ask that you be glorified in all things in Jesus name Amen amen brother Jason amen praise the Lord God bless you man we're happy to have brother Jason deliver that today I'm just saving my voice a little bit for tonight it's a little bit ratty and so I was trying to save my strength and actually I was supposed to be in New Zealand so brother Jason was actually scheduled for the service here today so it just worked out fine too sly him right back in there but I I thought that I would like to just make a small short address to you being that it is Easter morning for us we were I was actually preaching my Easter message last night a man because we were doing it via through digital means through the internet but this is a glorious day a man I've got a little bit of an echo back up up here brother Joe maybe take the monitors down to still be bit perhaps and and so we were really enjoying that last night and I certainly enjoyed what I heard this morning I thought it's profound and I wholeheartedly endorse it I think that it's a very amazing subject when we really begin to back up and take it in from a high altitude and look at the plan of God whenever I do that I always get astonished at God's plan of redemption amen that that what it looks like when I back up and look at how he mapped it all out from Genesis all the way through revelation and then see it play out in history and see it having effect in our lives today amen I you know I I want to just take they're saying my mic needs turned up just a little bit brothers on the stream amen so I wanted to take just a few minutes and just kind of go over some things and just take a few minutes if I can to thank the engineering team and all the brothers and musicians and who have made these services possible in case I forget to say that tonight I want to say it to them now it's been a flurry of activity and you know I just want to thank them for their capital job that they've done it hasn't you know there's technology as filled with gremlins and brother Murphy hangs out at every service and so he's always messing things up but we've got through it and it's it's been going good we even today we had trying to switch back and forth between working with the team in New Zealand and back on to our regular service today you wouldn't you wouldn't believe the flurry of activity that goes on I'm really ready to get back to normal I'll just tell you I am ready to get back to normal because you know the we we we had so much going on today and messages are flying back and forward and you don't even see it on camera I know that that some you know perhaps when you you you all you see is the problems with the sound or the video or this that or the other and believe me the team sees it too and right away they start getting bombed and everybody's bombing them and I'm getting bombed and I'm saying they're working on it they're saying we're working on it and oh my it is it is it can really get topsy-turvy I had to quickly run out today we had a microphone that brother Matt needed for his Tucson service preparing while this was going on and I don't even think you saw it I uh I hope brother George had the camera angled up brother Joe was actually on the floor here on his hands and knees sneaking under brother Jason to Mars taking equipment out of here transferring it back to there oh my goodness friends it's it's been a it's been a it's been a doozy and so you know we we did our best and if we if we you know made mistakes and I got caught with an embarrassing mistake I'm glad I got to delete it probably for most of you all even got to see it but a man I had sent a message to my son johnathan it turns out funny but it's also embarrassing and I think Lord was teaching me you know you're not supposed to be texting in church hey man I preached that so I got to live by it myself but sometimes I am because I'm talking to the booth if you ever see that happening a man it's it's it's usually almost always in relation to church someone's asking about a problem on the stream I'll be glad when we get to heaven and you know there I used to hear brother Ed's say all the time there'll be no wires in heaven and I'm so glad for that there would be no wars in heaven and there would be no wires in heaven amen and we won't need these silly devices a man to text back and forth or whatsapp back and forth and so I just wanted to just give a pen arose on the team the musicians the worship leaders the technical people a man it's just been a whole team effort I sure couldn't have got started doing it amen if I didn't have these brothers willing and it's believe me as frustrating as sometimes it can be to you out there it's very frustrating to them when equipments not working or a piece of software isn't working or Internet's not working and it can be rather maddening but I hope that you will continue to have patience we're still working on things looks like we are going to get the fiber optic line from har gray they're gonna bring it down this road it doesn't exist right now they've agreed to build it and bring it down just to connect to our church so I think that's an answer to prayer amen our brothers who are in the know on that kind of thing know that that's going to cover a multitude of problems amen just that by itself you know we never thought that we would experience you know the loss of assembly when brother Branham talked about some day you won't be able to worship like this we never really thought it would be like this and you know we we followed the request of the government and you know some some chose not to even even a few pastors you see it on the news there's even a very small amount of pastors even within the message who felt you know not not to do that not to follow those guidelines and I'm not here to judge another man's servant you know III will say I don't want to see anybody cashing a stimulus check that didn't follow the government's recommendations if you didn't shelter with all of us then don't go running the bank cashing that stimulus check give it to somebody who did a man so but anyway praise the Lord let me let me move on amen so you know but it's interesting because normally you know on Easter if you think about it historically speaking my wife and I were talking about it this morning and normally you you you have to set out extra chairs on an Easter service think about that normally you have to set out extra chairs and and even even they make jokes about it even preachers you know there's the old running joke to say I just want to say you know Merry Christmas Happy Birthday and Happy New Year because I know I won't see you again for another year next Easter so let me just go ahead and get wish you happy birthday Merry Christmas and Happy New Year and if you married happy anniversary amen now so but and I say that just for the irony of it all that that for the first time in our generation anyway in our generation at least here in the privileged land of America you know for the first time Easter can't be about a new dress or a new outfit or a new hat or setting out chairs for people that come once a year you know it's it's not about any of that kind of stuff we're finally back to the actual book of Acts when they celebrated Easter before it was ever called Easter amen think about what that church was doing on the first year anniversary of his resurrection you know what the Bible the book of Acts says they were going house to house so you and your home's today you're more in line with the book of Acts than we've ever been a man so I appreciate the Lord you know I I remember brother Matt ministering early on when we first had to start you know keeping it limited and we were we were a little bit over our gbbw today we had one extra person and so we were sending certain ones home we had to send a couple of musicians home and we're happy for everyone and we'll have to you know we're having to figure out the schedule and that's another maddening thing for me to have to figure out daily and you know you're always in a flurry of texting back and forth or you on are you in or you out are you on and and and and and so you get that aspect of it and so you know I remember brother Matt talking about he had commented on I had made a comment about if one thing that this virus situation has done is it took us off the treadmill because you know it made everything stop America as a nation just stopped business stopped commerce stopped everybody's stay home everybody's shelter in place you know no more social distancing don't meet in groups of more than ten and I mean you know you can get you can still find grocery stores and pharmacies and you know I think they call that and they've got another word essential businesses but I mean all of the places where you'd normally shop you can't go in there anymore they might have a curbside service they might not you know and so we we've been home with our families and you know I said what a what an amazing thing it is hey guess what you're off the treadmill take some time use this time and brother Matt was speaking about that and he made a comment you know after going down that whole line of thinking to say listen you know this is the time brother Diggs was preaching about it how many remember that Amen that you know spend the time with your family that you never had before slow down back up you know dust off the Bibles restart family altar pray you know pray together come together and and it's so stuck with me the statement brother Matt made about hey don't come back after this don't don't don't be the person that that after this is all over and you're back on the treadmill and you didn't use that time and you didn't take advantage don't come back after all this and you still are no better off than you ever were before and you know you're you're that take the time let me just say it again we don't know how much longer this will go on we know it's gonna go through the end of April for sure the president is talking about trying to open or partially open our phased opening of the country back we don't know what that's going to look like this may go into long-term through April even in to me it's quite possible the team the ministry team and I andhe and the elders the deacons and trustees we've talked a little bit about long-term plans we've still got to do some more discussion on that prayerfully make some decisions going forward so I just want to kind of bring you up to speed today Church and say god bless you we're we're praying let's be praying one for another and let's be you know all for one and one for all let's where I say at all the time we're all in this thing together and I I've been when I watch the the nightly news on the Internet Archive I've been hearing the leading news lady for CBS I think and she's constantly looking in the camera going hey y'all we're all in this together and I'm going she's been listening to my sermons man she must be on our church archive because I say that all the time we're all in this thing together amen and so let's continue to have patience and pull and pray and and and you know the Lord will put us back together in His perfect will I'm glad for the technology I'm glad we have these silly devices I you know you know even if I stumble and trip and embarrass myself but I'm still glad I got it amen I'm glad I can communicate and I'm glad we can fix problems if there's a problem we can fix it you can let me know you know and and we're doing the best that we can Amen with what we have and it looks like the Lord's given us quite a bit so that we can work and make it good and make it right but friends don't rely you know I remember making a statement that I heard brother Paula Fontaine make recently you know how that you know how do you expect to fight a devil who comes after you daily if all you ever arm yourself with is a two or three days a week and he fights you daily how you going to overcome if you're only once or twice or three times a week and you're against a devil who fights you who doesn't sleep and he comes to try to Infant invade your sleep your waking your moving he he has no respect you can come to the house of God and he'll come right and try to invade your mind and I'm gonna take something friends we've got to have a lifestyle that is daily as Jesus said take up your cross daily amen and so you know that that is a that is that is a prerequisite that is a very necessary element so just a reminder again take this time friends you families fathers mothers let there be some some rebuilding let there be some rededication let there be some recon secretion let us not come to the end of this and not having taken the opportunity that the slower lifestyle has afforded so god bless you we send you greetings here from the from the tabernacle here and the brothers that are gathered with us we we thank everyone and sister Kathy with us god bless you and when sister Deb was here I kept having to say brothers and sister Deb Amen so we're happy to have all the brothers and sister Kathy with us her much came up with brother Jack we've been happy to have him last night and today a man so a man's son yeah I was it was home runs last night so I got one I got some more and I got another bullet so we've got another service tonight so if you to make it for that one a man we're gonna be trying to we're not knocking baseballs out of the park I've got a baseball bat trying to knock the devil out of the park amen so so praise the Lord let's all stand to our feet amen and just take the rest of this day friends and just thank the Lord for that day on Calvary and thank him for the resurrection because he lives I can face tomorrow because he lives all fear is gone because I know he holds my future and life because of that is worth the living because he lives a man do you believe that amen I believe it amen amen let's pray just before we sing it father we thank you for this wonderful day I thank you for the ministry that came forth thank you for the word that we heard the singing the worship Lord I just found it all to be lovely I pray now for brother Matt service Lord it's at this time he'll be gearing up getting ready to broadcast to the set to the assembly there in Tucson and in just a little while Lord will be gathering back here again father for two to finish up the meetings there in New Zealand and I pray Lord Jesus that you will equip me with your mind Lord and your thoughts father equip all your servants around the world there there's they're running the the live stream on the Louisiana youth camp Lord I pray you will anoint those ministers mightily Lord Jesus father others father brother John Andes ministering on a on our Easter convention over the internet those are just the ones I'm aware of lord I pray that you bless all the technology bless all the teams that can make it possible bless the speaker and hearers so Lord we thank you for this day now we thank you for that day on Calvary not only your death and burial but your resurrection because you live Lord we not only have a hope but we have an assured I thank you for that Lord I am the happy beneficiary of all that you accomplished Lord brother Branham would say now that now euros heroes Jesus rose but but what good that's great for him but what good does that do me if I don't if I didn't raise with him so lord may we find ourselves today included in the death burial and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ if I if I'm going to take if I'm going to follow the command of the word and be buried in water they didn't leave me under the water thankfully they pulled me back up if I'm going to be witness your death and your barrel and your resurrection and I'm going to do that symbolically in baptism then Lord let my whole life follow that I pray you're granted that my life will appear as one resurrected in Christ Jesus who has ascended up on high and is now sitting together in heavenly places let that show through me let when people see me they see a resurrection when they hear me will around me they hear my speech they'll they'll see that Wow here's one who's sitting in heavenly places and it's and it's it's coming through grab that signal Lord your blessing all of our other digital signals bless that supernatural signal Lord father that that presence of the Shekinah that I'm resting in in my soul that it will emanate out through my spirit and through my flesh and control everything around me and reflect to others the great light that you are granted master we committed to you in Jesus name Amen
