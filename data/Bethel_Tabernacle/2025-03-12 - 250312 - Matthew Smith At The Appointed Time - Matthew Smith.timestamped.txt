[27:05] house of the Lord
[27:07] tonight. Some of you are wondering if
[27:09] it's Sunday morning and if this is
[27:10] Sunday school. It is Wednesday night and
[27:13] I am
[27:14] preaching. Uh but uh it's good to be
[27:17] here. Um I uh uh have this just a little
[27:22] thought. I pretty simple. Um hopefully
[27:24] it's not too simple for you. Um if we
[27:28] could uh before we actually before we go
[27:30] to our scripture, let's let's have a
[27:32] word of prayer.
[27:35] Father, Lord, this this
[27:38] evening as we gather here in your name,
[27:41] in this house you've given us to gather
[27:43] in, Father, Lord, we want to set aside
[27:46] all of our worries and our fears and our
[27:50] struggles, Lord, that we're going to lay
[27:52] them at your feet this evening, Father,
[27:53] that
[27:55] maybe maybe something that would be said
[27:58] that it would encourage the people,
[28:01] Father, that we wouldn't be dependent or
[28:03] relying on
[28:05] some some idea or some concoction that I
[28:08] would come up with some
[28:11] formulation, Lord, that Father, I can't
[28:14] help
[28:15] anybody. Can't really help
[28:17] myself. So, Father, we're asking this
[28:20] evening that you would come down and you
[28:22] would help us. that if I could step out
[28:24] of the way, Lord, that I could set aside
[28:27] any feelings of mine, Lord, set aside
[28:30] any
[28:31] any thoughts of mine, Lord, and and just
[28:34] only accept what you would have to say
[28:35] that Lord, everyone could be blessed,
[28:38] Lord. Everyone could go go away free of
[28:41] a burden that they've been carrying.
[28:44] So Lord, we're we're asking that you
[28:46] would meet us here, that you'd give us
[28:48] grace, that we could yield ourselves to
[28:51] the to the operating of the
[28:54] gift that, Father, that it would it
[28:58] would bring life to us this
[29:00] evening. That you would provide a
[29:02] context for this scripture that we're
[29:03] about to read. that Lord that you would
[29:06] grant us a revelation of it that we
[29:09] could we could read a word, Father, and
[29:11] we could try to understand.
[29:13] But Lord, without your without your
[29:16] revelation, we just never would we'd
[29:18] never grasp it. It would never become
[29:19] real. It would just simply be a a a
[29:23] verse that we could memorize or quote,
[29:25] but Lord, that it would for it to be
[29:28] lived, for it to be real, for it to to
[29:31] put on skin, Lord, it has to be a
[29:34] revelation. So, Father, we're asking
[29:36] that you would grant the revelation of
[29:38] your word this evening as we would read.
[29:41] We ask this in the name of the Lord
[29:42] Jesus Christ.
[29:45] Amen. Amen. want to
[29:48] turn if we
[29:50] would to Haggi, book of
[29:55] Haggi. Some of you might have not heard
[29:58] of that book before. It is in the Bible,
[30:00] I promise. Um, it's book of Haggi. It's
[30:03] right before Zachchariah. Um, and it's
[30:06] two whole
[30:07] chapters. Um, and we're going to return
[30:10] to Haggi chapter 2 and verse one.
[30:20] says, "In the seventh month,
[30:23] uh, in the 1 and 12th day of the month
[30:25] came the word of the Lord by the prophet
[30:27] Haggi, saying, "Speak
[30:30] now." Uh, oh, I'm sorry. I got the wrong
[30:34] book. Whoopsies. It's Habach. That's
[30:37] what I'm looking for.
[30:40] Uh, tell you what, I got it right here
[30:42] on my device and we'll we'll just I'll
[30:44] just read it off of this and you don't
[30:45] have to turn. We'll save some time. Um,
[30:48] so we're reading Habach chapter 2. Uh, I
[30:52] was reading Hagi earlier and I had my
[30:54] marker there. Um, so Habach chapter 2
[30:57] verse 1. says, "I will stand upon my
[31:01] watch and set me upon the tower, and I
[31:04] will watch to see what he will say unto
[31:06] me, and what I shall answer when I am
[31:10] reproved." And the Lord answered me and
[31:13] said, "Write the vision, and make it
[31:15] plain upon tables, that he may run that
[31:17] readeth it. For the vision is yet for an
[31:21] appointed time, but at the end it shall
[31:24] speak and not lie, though it tar. wait
[31:28] for it because it will surely come. It
[31:31] will not tarry. Behold, his soul which
[31:34] is lifted up is not upright in him, but
[31:37] the just shall live by
[31:39] faith. The Lord bless the reading of the
[31:42] word as you are
[31:44] seated. So, I have a pretty simple kind
[31:49] of a straightforward
[31:51] uh thought this evening. Um, and as a
[31:53] title, I told the the booth, um, at the
[31:57] appointed time. And that's kind of the
[31:59] the theme that we're we're thinking of,
[32:02] you know, that I I had on my mind. And
[32:05] when I read this, it just so struck me
[32:08] that here's the prophet and the Lord
[32:11] speaking to the prophet and he's and
[32:12] he's he's illustrating to this prophet
[32:15] that there's a vision, right? There's a
[32:17] vision that's gone out that's
[32:19] that's governing the lives of the people
[32:22] of Israel that their whole future is
[32:26] going to be in accordance with this
[32:27] vision, right? That the Lord had a
[32:29] vision for his people and it's going to
[32:31] come to pass, but it's not going to
[32:34] happen when they're going to expect.
[32:36] It's not going to happen according to
[32:37] what makes sense to them. It's going to
[32:40] not look like the vision is going to
[32:41] come to
[32:42] pass, but it is. is has an appointed
[32:47] time. There's there's a a a
[32:49] a Lord has a a a a situation. He's got a
[32:55] formulation for how it's going to work
[32:56] out. He's got um an idea of a thought
[32:59] for how this is going to play out. And
[33:01] it's for a certain time and a certain
[33:03] place and a certain set of
[33:04] circumstances. Thank you, brother.
[33:07] Um certain set of circumstances.
[33:12] Uh, and it's going to happen in
[33:13] accordance with
[33:16] that, but people aren't going to think
[33:19] that it's going to make any sense to
[33:20] them, right? It's going to it's going to
[33:22] happen. And when it happens, there'll be
[33:25] no question as to if that's what the
[33:27] vision was.
[33:30] And, you know, obviously, I think we can
[33:33] all kind of relate to this, right? I
[33:35] know in my life,
[33:38] uh, you know, part of this I' I've
[33:41] actually
[33:42] uh preached this sermon before, Brother
[33:44] Blues, and
[33:47] um you know, and I had kind of a
[33:50] different there's a lot of different
[33:50] ways you can go with this and but since
[33:53] then my dad I talked to my dad on the
[33:55] phone um and he told me something and it
[33:58] I don't know it just stuck in my heart
[33:59] and then it really kind of fit with this
[34:02] and so he we're having a phone call and
[34:05] and he was telling just telling me a
[34:07] funny story and it was funny um and he's
[34:09] he's talking about how he was kind of
[34:11] committed is reading with a with a
[34:12] brother in his church, you know, about,
[34:14] you know, weward kids and teenagers
[34:15] being hoodlams. And um he tells his
[34:19] brother, he goes, you know, he goes,
[34:21] "When my youngest son was a little boy,
[34:25] he's
[34:26] like anybody who met him would have
[34:28] been, oh, that kid's going to be a
[34:29] preacher." It's like, I knew he's going
[34:30] to be a preacher. It was obvious. And
[34:32] then he became a teenager and then I
[34:34] thought, "Wow, actually I've got a
[34:36] serpent
[34:38] seed." And you know at the time I would
[34:41] have agreed with
[34:43] him but he's like but completely almost
[34:48] as almost irrelevant to any this is my
[34:50] dad speaking you know almost irrelevant
[34:52] to anything that he did or at least you
[34:53] know what he felt like he had done I got
[34:56] saved and it wasn't he didn't he it
[34:58] wasn't my dad who prayed through with
[35:01] me. It wasn't you know he didn't give me
[35:04] some words that you know inspired me and
[35:06] and changed the course. No, it was kind
[35:09] of not to say irrelevant, but it was
[35:12] kind of separate from anything that he
[35:14] had said or
[35:15] done. Now, I can look back in the past
[35:18] and go, "No, that's actually wrong." All
[35:20] the, you know, cuz my my mom has voiced
[35:22] similar similar feelings like, man, it
[35:25] almost seems like I prayed so many years
[35:27] and it didn't feel like I was of any
[35:29] help. All I I prayed and prayed and
[35:31] prayed and then I had nothing to do with
[35:33] it. And now I can say as the as the
[35:37] subject of all those prayers that's not
[35:39] true. I know because of all the times
[35:42] that were where I could have gone one
[35:45] way and didn't where I know my nature
[35:47] and I would have gone a different way
[35:49] and I didn't. And I can look back and
[35:51] say had I gone that way I never would
[35:53] have ended up in the right place. Right?
[35:55] And that's nothing but a mom and dad who
[35:58] cared. a mom and dad who spent hours
[36:02] praying. But, you know, it's, you know,
[36:06] he tells me the story and it's like, but
[36:08] you know, we have these desires and we
[36:11] have a promise that we're holding to,
[36:13] maybe for the salvation of kids, maybe
[36:15] for a healing, maybe for a deliverance
[36:17] from something, maybe, you know,
[36:19] whatever it is, maybe for guidance.
[36:22] you've got some some difficult decision
[36:24] that you don't know how to handle and
[36:27] you know that the Lord is going to give
[36:29] you there's going to be
[36:31] resolution but it's hard and and a lot
[36:33] of
[36:34] times
[36:36] we you know we get impatient or we get
[36:41] desperate and it happens and it will
[36:44] happen but it's going to happen in
[36:45] accordance to God's time and place and
[36:48] circumstance and we a lot of times we
[36:51] won't even see it woman and it'll be
[36:53] just kind of almost irrelevant to
[36:54] whatever it is that we do.
[36:58] And um you know, I I thought about that
[37:02] and my dad's saying that and
[37:04] it it so struck me that you know, here's
[37:07] my parents praying about my life and and
[37:12] calling on God for their wretched
[37:14] heathen
[37:16] son. And at the same time, there were
[37:18] things that were happening in my life
[37:20] where the Lord had been dealing with me
[37:23] where I was praying for answers to, you
[37:26] know, calling out to God and I wasn't
[37:28] getting anything back. There was a plan
[37:30] for my life, right? There were things
[37:33] that were going to happen and it was all
[37:34] had to happen exactly right or it
[37:36] wouldn't have it wouldn't have wouldn't
[37:37] have worked. It wouldn't have stuck. It
[37:39] wouldn't have landed and it wouldn't
[37:40] have been real and genuine.
[37:44] and it brought to my mind this this
[37:46] quote. Um, so there's there's a couple
[37:49] quotes. One, Brother Bam talks about I
[37:51] don't have it here. I forgot to load it
[37:54] up, but he talks about um how, you know,
[37:57] people will will pray for something.
[37:59] They'll pray and it'll be in accordance
[38:01] with the word. You know, the Lord has a
[38:02] promise for that and then they'll keep
[38:04] thinking about it over and over and over
[38:06] again and they'll be, you know, trying
[38:07] to kind of make it go. And he says,
[38:09] "Whenever you do that, it's like a
[38:10] farmer planting a seed and then going
[38:12] out the next day and picking the seed
[38:14] out of the ground. Oh, will it sprout
[38:16] yet?" You know, and then putting it back
[38:17] and then every day come out to pull it
[38:19] out of the ground to see if it sprouted.
[38:20] It's like, "Okay, you're not letting it
[38:23] grow. You're not let it do it. The word
[38:24] is a seed. Plant it and wait. Take your
[38:29] hands off of it. If you keep trying to
[38:30] push it and and help it, you'll kill
[38:32] it."
[38:34] And the other one is this story of
[38:41] um it's a it's a story uh I'm we've all
[38:44] heard it and where he he sees a vision
[38:47] of a of a little boy who got healed.
[38:51] um in the vision he's praying for the
[38:53] little boy and he you know he sees the
[38:54] the room and the circumstance and all
[38:56] the people and then he goes to pray for
[38:59] the little boy and when he prayed for
[39:02] him the little boy doesn't get
[39:04] well and he's taken it back like what in
[39:07] the
[39:10] world and
[39:12] um he doesn't understand it and then he
[39:15] realizes is because the people there was
[39:18] one person who wasn't in the room that
[39:19] was in the vision the people weren't
[39:21] arranged the right way in the
[39:24] room. And it kind of takes me back like
[39:28] it literally the people everything had
[39:30] to be exactly according to the vision.
[39:32] It couldn't
[39:33] be one thing missing. It had to be
[39:36] exactly right or the or it wasn't going
[39:38] to happen. And I I kind of want to it so
[39:41] struck me. I want to read this. Uh let
[39:45] me pull it up here.
[39:55] Um there it is. Okay. This is this is
[39:59] from 1948 message called
[40:03] experiences. Um and so he's
[40:06] uh he gets to the house. The brother the
[40:09] the man who'd come to him it's um he's
[40:12] beating on brother Bram's door shaking
[40:14] the door calling out you got to help me.
[40:16] And brother Brandon had was in a vision
[40:18] in the house. He's like walking across
[40:19] the living room, goes into a vision,
[40:20] sees the whole thing. Someone's shakes
[40:24] brother Brandham out of the vision and
[40:25] it's the man coming that the vision's
[40:27] about or his son. And so they they go
[40:30] they get the associate pastor of of uh
[40:32] associate minister of uh Jeffersonville
[40:35] of the of the church there. They jump in
[40:37] the car and they drive north up to the
[40:39] man's house. The house is exactly what
[40:41] brother Brandham saw. They go in the
[40:43] house. Um, and
[40:46] um, let me
[40:50] see uh, where was I
[40:53] at? Um, and so they're on their way to
[40:56] the they're on the way to the the the
[40:59] uh to the house. The man had actually
[41:01] backslid and on the way there he gave
[41:03] his heart to the Lord. Um, because you
[41:06] know, you would if if your baby's dying
[41:09] and and the prophet's going to go pray
[41:10] for him.
[41:12] Um, and he says, "We went up, walked
[41:15] into the house, and as soon as I walked
[41:16] in, I seen the mother." Now, here's
[41:18] where you can always speak out of turn.
[41:20] Being that I brought this case is where
[41:22] I almost missed and caused something to
[41:24] happen. You have to watch what you're
[41:27] doing.
[41:28] I walked into the room um, and there
[41:31] laid the little baby lying there. There
[41:33] was the baseboard. There was the
[41:35] dualfofold chair with uh, with the
[41:37] dualfofold. and the man that was with
[41:39] me, brother Graham Snelling,
[41:43] um, and there's a blank spot. It says,
[41:45] uh, God's, so in the vision, he'd seen a
[41:47] a young man with, uh, blonde wavy hair,
[41:49] and that was the, um, brother Snelling
[41:51] was his his associate that had come up
[41:53] with him, and that was the man with the
[41:54] hair. Um, and so he's seen some of the
[41:57] things and so he's kind of in a hurry
[42:00] because the baby, um, I don't know if
[42:02] he'll if he'll say it here, but in the
[42:04] vision, he saw this baby. The baby is
[42:05] like contorted. His arms are wound up
[42:08] behind him. His He said that his feet
[42:10] were curled up and his feet were
[42:12] touching his hips because he was his
[42:14] body was so racked with disease and his
[42:17] chest was swelled up with pneumonia so
[42:19] bad that the fluid was swelled his chest
[42:21] up and he was poking his chest up out of
[42:22] his shirt. I mean, the baby's dying and
[42:25] it's hacking and gagging on and just
[42:28] drowning laying in the bed and this and
[42:31] people are panic. Mama's screaming and d
[42:33] crying because a doctor gave this baby a
[42:35] couple hours to live. Okay, the the
[42:39] human being is gonna be in a hurry,
[42:42] right? The human brother Brandham is
[42:44] going to be in a hurry. No one wants to
[42:46] sit there and watch this baby suffer,
[42:48] right? Everyone's panicked because this
[42:50] baby's
[42:51] dying. But he says, "God's in no hurry.
[42:55] We're the ones in a hurry, not God." And
[42:57] I said, "Bring me the baby now if you
[42:59] got faith." They brought the baby and
[43:01] the mother um the baby was barely
[43:04] living. Um the only way you could tell
[43:08] um was hold a little piece of fine paper
[43:10] to its nose and see if there's breath
[43:12] coming and going from its nose. That's
[43:15] how bad it
[43:16] was. Well, I seen that twisting of the
[43:19] body was the pneumonia. It was just dead
[43:22] practically all of it up to here. And
[43:24] that's the only place it was breathing.
[43:27] Um, that's what the sign of was of the
[43:30] twisting. I said, "Bring it here." And
[43:32] they brought it uh over there and my
[43:35] when I prayed for it, if anything, it
[43:37] got worse. Its little eyes set. Its
[43:40] tongue came out. It little head went
[43:42] back. Well, I thought, "Wait, there's
[43:44] something wrong. I have never in my life
[43:47] seen that fail." Because um that that's
[43:52] just as true as the Bible. God has
[43:54] already spoke it. There's no way you can
[43:57] doubt that. You don't have to ask the
[43:59] person if you got faith. It's already
[44:01] pronounced by Almighty God. It's going
[44:03] to happen. So, he's taken it back
[44:06] because wait a minute, I saw a vision.
[44:08] They It's not regardless of their faith,
[44:09] this is going to happen, right? So, why
[44:13] didn't it happen? And I thought, uh,
[44:16] there was something wrong. And I happen
[44:17] to think, why? There's one person that
[44:19] wasn't in the house and nothing was in
[44:22] order. the old mother was uh nobody
[44:24] there with um them glasses on. He had
[44:27] seen an old an older lady with glasses
[44:29] on sitting in the chair in the vision
[44:31] and she wasn't there. Amen. Um was
[44:33] nobody there with the glasses on. Where
[44:35] was she at? Well, I thought, well, now
[44:37] that and they took the little boy over
[44:39] there and it just choking and it says
[44:42] brother Brand and you know he's making a
[44:44] choking noise and and the mother ran
[44:45] over to it and the father and they began
[44:48] to work on it and put this stuff over
[44:49] its nose and things and they both got to
[44:51] screaming and left the baby alone.
[44:53] Brother Graham started working with it.
[44:55] So just like that now just as blue as it
[44:58] could be its little blue body it laying
[45:00] stiff like that lungs all lungs was
[45:03] congested it was even folded up and
[45:06] pushing his little ribs like that where
[45:08] the lungs was
[45:11] um uh and I'm going to skip down and it
[45:14] says and I know that mother wasn't there
[45:16] then I knew that I had missed I'd failed
[45:20] God and so now brother Brham is having a
[45:24] panic panic attack because here's a
[45:27] dying baby and as far as he's concerned
[45:30] that baby probably's going to die and
[45:32] it's his fault because he missed the
[45:35] vision. He saw the vision and because he
[45:37] got ahead of himself
[45:40] now he's got to he just put himself out
[45:42] there and said, "Well, if you got faith,
[45:44] let me pray for him." And now he prayed
[45:45] for him and this baby might die. And and
[45:47] this man just gave his heart to the Lord
[45:49] on the faith of brother, you know,
[45:50] having faith in the prophet that might
[45:53] show him up. right? How what's this
[45:56] going to do to this family when their
[45:58] baby dies
[45:59] and when a prophet, you know, spoke on
[46:03] behalf of God and because he had told
[46:05] the man on the way up there that it was
[46:07] thus sayith the Lord, he'd seen it in a
[46:09] vision and now this and now he's
[46:11] thinking, I messed it up. I ruined it. I
[46:15] got out of turn and now this baby's
[46:16] going to die.
[46:19] And so, uh, he goes on, he's talking,
[46:23] you know, talking about how he he's, and
[46:25] I've heard this story before. I've heard
[46:27] it, you know, you know, plenty of times.
[46:29] For some reason, in my mind, it was like
[46:31] he just had to sit there and wait for
[46:33] like 15, 20 minutes. It's not what
[46:35] happened. He had to wait for like hours.
[46:38] It was a long time. He didn't say
[46:40] exactly how long. He said he waited till
[46:42] the sun came up. So, however long that
[46:44] was, right?
[46:47] And he's sitting there and everyone's
[46:48] the the baby didn't get any better. It's
[46:51] been getting worse this whole time. It's
[46:52] only looking like it's going to die even
[46:55] more. And then the sun's coming up and
[46:59] the man that he had seen the the
[47:01] associate minister that come up with him
[47:03] that had the wavy hair, he's got to go
[47:05] to work. He's telling the brother, "Ah,
[47:07] brother, you know, I got to go to work.
[47:09] Can you give me a ride back to
[47:10] Jeffersonville?"
[47:12] And the whole time, Brother Bram's
[47:15] obviously having to keep a straight face
[47:17] about all this. He knows that he messed
[47:20] up. They don't know he messed up. And he
[47:24] can't show this. He's having to
[47:27] have, you know, not let these people
[47:29] panic because he's praying. He's he's
[47:31] repenting to God going, "Lord, don't let
[47:33] this baby die because of my failure."
[47:35] Yeah. And he's he's hanging on and he's
[47:40] saying, "Well," and now he's going, "Oh,
[47:42] if he leaves, then who knows when he's
[47:44] going to come back. I might have to wait
[47:45] here for days." Brother Bram's prepared
[47:48] to sit in that room for
[47:49] days because he knows this baby's life
[47:52] depends on it. If he has any hope of
[47:55] this baby
[47:56] living. And so the the brother's getting
[47:59] up to walk out the door. He's going to
[48:00] go to go to work. He got a he's drive uh
[48:02] drove a
[48:04] truck and he's brother Brandon's going,
[48:07] "Oh Lord, you know, let it let this baby
[48:10] live. You know, don't don't punish this
[48:13] family and this baby for my
[48:15] account." And he looks up and he
[48:18] sees the lady with the glasses coming
[48:21] down the driveway. And now his heart's
[48:23] racing like, "Oh Lord, it could happen.
[48:26] It's it's" He's starting to see the
[48:27] vision unfold.
[48:31] But the the one brother's about to walk
[48:33] out the door and she's coming in the
[48:34] back door and the door was locked and
[48:36] she's beating on the door to get in and
[48:37] the other sister has to go let her in.
[48:39] And this guy's putting on his jacket to
[48:41] walk out the front door. And the whole
[48:43] time he's sitting there going with
[48:46] baited breath going, "No, don't walk out
[48:48] that door." And he can't say a word
[48:50] about it. You know who in there? And I'm
[48:54] sitting there reading this going, "Well,
[48:54] Brother Brandham, just tell him to wait
[48:56] a minute. You know, don't don't let him
[48:58] walk out the door. the baby's going to
[49:00] die. You know, don't don't you know,
[49:03] surely you could just tell him to to
[49:04] hold off. It is just a couple minutes.
[49:06] He's about to but he can't he can't say
[49:08] anything. Can't say a word. He's got to
[49:10] sit there and wait for God's timing and
[49:13] do nothing to move it forward of his own
[49:18] doing.
[49:20] And the the the sister walks in, she
[49:23] sits down in the chair and then he's
[49:26] waiting and waiting and waiting. And
[49:27] then the brother is about to walk out
[49:29] and then he goes and he sits down on the
[49:31] chair cuz cuz she had seen the the old
[49:34] the older lady had seen the the baby and
[49:36] started crying cuz it was her her
[49:37] grandson. And she breaks down and starts
[49:40] balling and and and the
[49:42] um the the the man who's going to leave
[49:45] the uh it was actually a relative of
[49:48] his. I think it was his would have been
[49:49] his aunt would have been the old lady.
[49:53] And so he sits down next to her and he
[49:56] starts crying too because it, you know,
[49:58] it kind of broke his heart a little bit.
[50:00] And so when in that moment, brother, he
[50:02] sees it and brother Brandon prays for
[50:04] the baby and the baby gets well. And
[50:07] then he says, and everyone's screaming.
[50:09] He's like, "Oh, you know, you should
[50:10] have seen him scream and shout and you
[50:12] know, run all around the house like you
[50:13] couldn't you can't imagine I mean, these
[50:15] people ba watch their baby go from just
[50:19] dying in agony to happy and and healthy
[50:22] in seconds. And so they're they're
[50:25] rejoicing and they they and he goes,
[50:27] "Now put the baby back in the bed. Put
[50:28] the little boy back in the bed. It's
[50:30] going to take three days for the
[50:31] recovery to be complete." Because that's
[50:32] what he seen in his vision. And in his
[50:34] vision, he had seen that three days
[50:36] later that he would walk back up to that
[50:38] house and that little boy would come out
[50:40] and shake his hand and say, "Brother
[50:42] Brand, I'm perfectly whole or I'm
[50:44] perfectly well." One of the two. And so
[50:47] he'd seen that. And so he's not going to
[50:49] let them mess it up. Put him back in the
[50:51] bed. He's still got to recover. And he
[50:53] goes back to his church and tells the
[50:55] people in Jeffersonville at the church
[50:57] what happened. And he said, "Now y'all
[50:58] come up there with me on this exact day
[51:00] and you'll see that happen. you I'm
[51:03] gonna go back to that house and that
[51:04] little boy is gonna come shake my hand.
[51:05] And and he tells a story about how the
[51:07] whole church went up there with him.
[51:09] They all parked their cars down the road
[51:10] so nobody could see and they all crept
[51:12] up to the house and were looking in the
[51:13] windows. Um the whole church gathering
[51:15] around cuz they and he, you know, goes
[51:17] and knocks on the door and the little
[51:18] boy runs out and shakes his hand and
[51:20] says the exact words that he heard saw
[51:22] in the
[51:24] vision.
[51:26] And this
[51:29] story was just
[51:32] So many times we will have a revelation
[51:36] from God. We will have a word from God
[51:38] in the Bible. We'll read a promise. we
[51:41] will do like brother Jason was saying on
[51:42] on
[51:44] um on
[51:46] Sunday that we'll find something in the
[51:48] Bible because that's I mean really I'm a
[51:52] I am a direct uh I have testimony to
[51:56] this that if you are dealing with a
[51:57] situation you find somebody in the Bible
[51:59] and say Lord you dealt with that person
[52:02] in that way I'm going to do my best to
[52:04] conform to the way they approached you
[52:07] and so you have to respond in the same
[52:09] way because you did it for them. Your
[52:11] word says you'll do it for me in the
[52:13] same
[52:14] way. And so we'll do that and then it
[52:17] doesn't happen exactly the way we
[52:19] thought it was going to do or it's
[52:20] taking a long time or things are looking
[52:23] really grim or we tripped over our own
[52:26] feet and think that we wrecked the
[52:28] promise, right? Because we got outside
[52:31] of what was going to happen. Now here's
[52:33] the thing. Brother Brandham is sitting
[52:35] here say is telling us, "Well, I saw it
[52:38] in a vision. it was going to happen
[52:41] whether they had faith in it or not.
[52:43] Okay, that's what he told us. And at the
[52:46] same time, he's telling us about how he
[52:48] was panicking because he thought he
[52:49] wrecked
[52:51] it. Okay, it was thus sayaeth the Lord.
[52:55] Thus sayaeth the Lord does not take into
[52:58] account your failures. Okay. Thus sayeth
[53:01] the Lord is irrelevant or or your faults
[53:05] and failures and weaknesses and you and
[53:07] you making uh a train wreck out of the
[53:10] situation does not negate thus sayeth
[53:13] the Lord. Okay? That's not how that
[53:15] works. All right? Thus sayeth the Lord
[53:17] means it is 100% going to happen. Just
[53:21] like Abraham could have doubted the word
[53:24] all he wants. You know, it talks about
[53:27] uh uh the the New Testament said that
[53:30] Abraham staggered not. If you read the
[53:31] Old Testament account to the human eye,
[53:34] it looks like Abraham staggered a lot.
[53:36] Okay? But it didn't matter because it
[53:40] was thus sayeth the Lord. The promise
[53:41] was going to come to pass no matter what
[53:43] Abraham did. Okay? The Lord knows the
[53:45] end from the beginning. And when he
[53:46] gives his word, it's going to happen.
[53:48] And it might not look like your
[53:51] particular uh circumstances are going to
[53:54] allow that. And often times those
[53:55] circumstances are us, right? We think
[53:58] our faults and failures. Now, that's not
[54:00] an excuse to just, you know, do
[54:02] whatever, right? That's that is a uh
[54:06] it's it's just simply a promise that
[54:08] when you fail, when you do your best and
[54:10] still fail, that's not going to cut you
[54:14] out of the promise. Okay? That's not
[54:17] there. You have a promise and it's and
[54:19] it's thus sayith the Lord. It's going to
[54:20] come to pass, right? the, you
[54:24] know, every promise in the in the
[54:26] scripture is thus sayeth the Lord. It's
[54:29] it's what the Lord said, right? It's
[54:31] kind of obvious. So, if you're holding
[54:34] that and you're saying, Lord, I'm
[54:35] approaching you on that basis, then that
[54:38] should mean something, right? That's,
[54:41] you know, you know, whatever our
[54:42] situation is, when we're applying the
[54:45] word to that situation, we should have
[54:47] confidence and faith. And even when
[54:49] something happens that shakes our faith,
[54:52] that pushes us, you know, makes us uh uh
[54:56] question, makes us scared that, oh no,
[54:59] maybe I stepped out of line and now it's
[55:00] not going to happen. No, just keep keep
[55:03] your your sides trained on that goal.
[55:06] Keep keep pushing forward, you know,
[55:08] repent. Go to the Lord, you know, repent
[55:11] of what you've done, right? Brother Matt
[55:13] said it really good. I really appreciate
[55:15] it. Confession is good, right? confess
[55:19] your faults and move
[55:21] on, right? You know, I understand that
[55:24] there are situations where the Lord can
[55:26] say no to certain things because for
[55:28] what whole myriad of
[55:31] reasons, but that don't let that don't
[55:36] let the devil use that as a club to beat
[55:39] your faith down. Okay? The Lord wants to
[55:42] help you. And I can guarantee you, I
[55:45] have I have experienced this firsthand
[55:48] that if it's something genuinely that
[55:50] you want that you just have a desire for
[55:52] and the Lord is going to shut that door
[55:55] and just say, "No, that can't
[55:58] happen." Give it some time and you will
[56:00] look back and go, "Oh, no. That was the
[56:02] right thing to happen." Right? I am glad
[56:04] that door got shut in my face because
[56:06] had it gone the way I wanted it to,
[56:09] something much worse was going to happen
[56:11] down the line. Okay,
[56:16] we but always approach approach it as if
[56:20] the answer is yes, right? Don't don't
[56:24] default to no. That's it's always no if
[56:28] you don't have faith, right?
[56:32] So, anyways, I Wow, it is 8
[56:37] o'lock. Wow, that's fast. Um, let me let
[56:41] me regroup and take a drink of
[56:50] water. Half the time when we have
[56:54] something, we feel like the Lord has has
[56:56] shown us, feels like the Lord has
[56:57] revealed it to us. This is the direction
[56:58] we're supposed to go. we feel like the
[57:00] uncction of the spirit to to move
[57:02] forward and then you know we'll walk out
[57:04] on faith. We'll we'll put footsteps to
[57:05] that. We'll go forward with it and
[57:09] then you know things will happen
[57:13] um or we'll get overzealous. This is the
[57:16] and this is this is honestly I think one
[57:18] of the bigger struggles of not just not
[57:21] so much losing your faith but
[57:25] becoming feeling like you have to do it
[57:30] right. I'm going to tell you a personal
[57:33] anecdote. That's a fancy word for I'm
[57:36] going tell you a little bit of my life
[57:37] story.
[57:41] Um,
[57:42] so I had
[57:45] um when I was a
[57:48] a let's see I have a tendency to be like
[57:51] well I'm going to tell you this story
[57:52] from last week. So it all started in my
[57:54] birthday in 1994.
[57:56] Um so um no so I fast forward from 1994.
[58:03] Um I I was I had just got back from
[58:05] Albuquerque in uh
[58:08] 2019 and um at that point um this is the
[58:11] phase of my life that I would would have
[58:13] wholeheartedly agreed with my dad. I
[58:15] might have been a serpent seed. Um, and
[58:18] uh I mean and I and I I'm saying that
[58:21] kind of facitiously at the time
[58:23] genuinely I believed it and I mean it in
[58:26] that exact terminology like I was kind
[58:28] of convinced that you know the Bible
[58:30] does say that there will be serpent seed
[58:31] and someone's got to fulfill that
[58:32] scripture so it might as well be me.
[58:34] Like and I wasn't being like you know
[58:38] snotty about that. like I wasn't just
[58:40] being uh like wasn't trying to be smart
[58:44] about it. And
[58:48] um but I had kind of come to a point
[58:51] where I was like Lord I guess I knew I I
[58:54] you know things happen and and you know
[58:56] like I said trying to not bog you down
[58:58] with a lot of details. I had become, I
[59:01] will say, God
[59:02] conscious. And I knew that I had come in
[59:06] contact with something really real. And
[59:08] I couldn't I
[59:11] couldn't I couldn't deny that. You know,
[59:14] the Lord, the devil has a lot of ways of
[59:17] of getting he knows your conscience and
[59:20] he knows your um he knows your
[59:22] psychology a lot better than you do and
[59:23] he knows exactly what buttons to push to
[59:26] just wad you up. and you know, mental
[59:29] jiu-jitsu and break your legs.
[59:33] Um, the devil will do that. The the
[59:37] thing is God know is is better than he
[59:39] is um and knows exactly how to undo all
[59:43] that um and knows how to push your
[59:45] buttons even better. And so at the time
[59:48] the devil had really wound me up. Like I
[59:51] was
[59:52] just you it was just a mess, right? Um a
[59:56] lot of people there's a I'm sure if you
[59:59] are familiar with me um you might think
[1:00:01] oh well he went to college and got
[1:00:03] convinced that there you know because of
[1:00:05] some liberal professor. Ah not really um
[1:00:08] actually most of my professors were
[1:00:10] really uh um amicable towards religion.
[1:00:13] A lot of them were Christians actually.
[1:00:14] Um the thing that wrecked me spiritually
[1:00:18] was the Joe Rogan
[1:00:21] podcast
[1:00:22] genuinely. Um there are two episodes of
[1:00:25] that of that podcast in which um the
[1:00:29] people that he had on presented some
[1:00:30] arguments that absolutely broke me
[1:00:33] spiritually. Um one of them was a girl
[1:00:35] who was the from the Westboro Baptist
[1:00:38] Church and she told her story about how
[1:00:40] she left the church because she became
[1:00:42] an atheist. And the other one was a
[1:00:46] um a man who had he was a a trained
[1:00:49] stage magician and he
[1:00:52] uh a large part of his career at that
[1:00:55] point was busting frauds like uh
[1:00:58] psychics and stuff like that. And a big
[1:01:00] part of his career had been exposing a
[1:01:04] um
[1:01:05] fraudulent uh con artist who was posing
[1:01:07] as a faith healer.
[1:01:10] and he goes through all this and I'm not
[1:01:12] going to get into all that, but let's
[1:01:13] just
[1:01:15] say it made me question a lot of things,
[1:01:18] okay? And it wasn't like, well, I know
[1:01:20] that everything that the message is is
[1:01:22] false. It is I'm going to need some real
[1:01:25] convincing because I don't know what to
[1:01:26] believe
[1:01:27] anymore. Okay? And that's all that's got
[1:01:30] to happen. That's all that's got to that
[1:01:32] you the devil gets you to that spot of I
[1:01:34] don't know anymore and he's got you. You
[1:01:37] going nowhere, right? you're
[1:01:40] done. And that's where I was at. I
[1:01:43] didn't know anymore. I I don't know what
[1:01:45] to I didn't know what what to believe
[1:01:48] because things can be fake so easily.
[1:01:51] It's so easy to to to you know, make
[1:01:55] something look supernatural and it's
[1:01:56] not. So if you're if you're going to
[1:01:57] look for you know oh well
[1:02:00] vindications vindications can be
[1:02:03] faked you know and it's not like it's
[1:02:06] not like uh the people and I'm not going
[1:02:09] to get into that but the point is you
[1:02:12] really got to have something real. You
[1:02:13] got to have something firsthand. You
[1:02:15] can't rely on somebody else's
[1:02:16] experience. And I knew that. And so I
[1:02:20] got to a point where I was like okay I
[1:02:22] don't know what to believe anymore. So,
[1:02:24] I'm going to go back to as square one of
[1:02:26] a place as I possibly can. I'm going to
[1:02:29] approach God as if nothing I know is
[1:02:32] real. I don't know. I don't know
[1:02:34] anything about the Bible because clearly
[1:02:36] I don't know anything, right? If God is
[1:02:40] real and he cares about me in
[1:02:41] particular, not as you know, God will
[1:02:44] God so loved the the world and that just
[1:02:45] sort of humanity in general. No, God
[1:02:48] cares about you in particular, right?
[1:02:50] It's not just humanity as a whole. I
[1:02:53] mean he does love humanity as a whole.
[1:02:54] He loves you particularly.
[1:02:56] Okay, there there's an important
[1:02:59] distinction in
[1:03:00] that. And because otherwise it's too
[1:03:03] easy to write yourself into serpent
[1:03:05] seed.
[1:03:07] And so I got to a point in my life where
[1:03:09] I said, "Lord, I'm going I don't know
[1:03:11] how to approach you. I know if there's
[1:03:13] something if if any of this is real, it
[1:03:15] is the message.
[1:03:18] And I know that if I approach you in a
[1:03:20] way that you've that you've dealt with
[1:03:21] other people that you have to honor that
[1:03:23] and I don't know of another way of doing
[1:03:26] this.
[1:03:29] So I wrote a letter to
[1:03:32] God. And in that letter I asked him the
[1:03:35] two most important questions that I had
[1:03:38] in my
[1:03:41] life. And um I went out in the woods.
[1:03:46] There's a particular tree that when I
[1:03:47] was a little kid, I would climb to the
[1:03:49] top of it and that's where I would talk
[1:03:51] to
[1:03:52] God. And I said, "If God is anywhere,
[1:03:56] he's
[1:03:57] here." And I nailed it to that
[1:04:01] tree. And nothing
[1:04:05] happened. Nothing happened. And I said,
[1:04:08] you know, I've had this moment in time
[1:04:11] where I really felt like if I was going
[1:04:14] to talk to God, it had been right here
[1:04:15] and now. And I'm not going to sit around
[1:04:18] waiting for an answer. And I had I in
[1:04:20] the letter I said, "Lord, if you're
[1:04:25] real, I'm dealing with doubt right
[1:04:29] now."
[1:04:31] And
[1:04:33] Thomas said that he wouldn't believe
[1:04:35] until he put his finger in your wounds.
[1:04:38] And when you came back, what you didn't
[1:04:40] do is appear in the room and banish
[1:04:43] Thomas. You You gave him what he needed
[1:04:46] to see. I said, "Lord, I need to see
[1:04:49] something real because that's the only
[1:04:51] way I'm going to have
[1:04:53] faith." And I've got to have something.
[1:04:58] And I'm not going to put a constraint on
[1:04:59] it. I'm not going to say, "Well, this is
[1:05:01] what I've got to see because you know me
[1:05:03] better than I know myself." If you are
[1:05:05] really are what you say you are, you
[1:05:07] will know me better than I know myself
[1:05:09] and you will show me something that will
[1:05:12] be so far
[1:05:14] beyond what I could have come up with.
[1:05:18] Because if I come up with it, it'll be
[1:05:20] too easy for me to walk myself back out
[1:05:22] of it and say, "Well, I wanted to
[1:05:23] believe in it too much." Because I know
[1:05:27] human psychology well enough to know
[1:05:28] that if you really want something to be
[1:05:30] true, it'll be easy. Like you'll believe
[1:05:32] in it too easy. So if I want it to be
[1:05:35] true, then now I'm skeptical of it,
[1:05:38] right? So no, go beyond that. Go beyond
[1:05:42] what I'm going to see coming because and
[1:05:45] if you're God and you're capable and
[1:05:47] you're actually all powerful, you can do
[1:05:49] it. Amen. And so that's what I did. And
[1:05:52] I waited like I didn't even wait. I said
[1:05:55] until then, I'm not going to act like I
[1:05:57] believe in anything because I
[1:06:01] don't. And I went about my day. I went
[1:06:03] about my way for
[1:06:05] months. And
[1:06:07] then time passes, circumstance
[1:06:11] change. And I come to a point and I have
[1:06:14] a
[1:06:15] conversation with our pastor in that
[1:06:20] office. And it was the thing that I had
[1:06:24] wrote about in my letter.
[1:06:26] The two questions that I had were, Lord,
[1:06:30] do you care about me in
[1:06:33] particular? And am I supposed to marry
[1:06:38] Katie?
[1:06:40] Right? That's kind of important. The two
[1:06:42] biggest questions of a man's
[1:06:44] life. And I got the answer to both of
[1:06:47] them in one
[1:06:49] shot. And I was like thrilled. You can't
[1:06:53] even imagine. Like I'm having fits of
[1:06:56] hysterical uncontrollable laughter. Like
[1:06:58] like I'm sure anybody who saw this
[1:07:01] thought I had actually gone insane and
[1:07:03] needed to be committed. Like actually
[1:07:07] genuinely completely out of my mind. I
[1:07:10] have
[1:07:12] uh you know different I I the only way I
[1:07:17] know how to describe it in that moment
[1:07:18] was
[1:07:21] um which I I will say this um brother
[1:07:24] Jason has actually told a little bit of
[1:07:25] the story before and how the Lord had
[1:07:27] told me an exact phrase to say and it
[1:07:29] and at the end of it I was like oh why
[1:07:30] didn't you start with that? Well,
[1:07:31] because the first two hours of that
[1:07:33] conversation, there were two things that
[1:07:35] he were dealing with, and he was dealing
[1:07:36] with both of those episodes of that
[1:07:39] podcast. The first two hours was hacking
[1:07:42] through the theological quagmire of
[1:07:44] Romans chapter
[1:07:46] 9. Okay? Because of one problem that I
[1:07:49] had. And the other problem was was was a
[1:07:52] supernaturally constructed phrase that
[1:07:55] cut through every single piece of
[1:07:57] reasoning that I had to literally quoted
[1:08:00] a conversation that he had no party to.
[1:08:04] Brother Jason had no party to this. And
[1:08:06] he literally quoted an exact quote from
[1:08:08] a conversation from like 48 hours before
[1:08:11] that was purely
[1:08:13] supernatural, right? Completely
[1:08:16] supernatural with that one phrase. And
[1:08:18] I'm sitting there going,"Wh didn't you
[1:08:19] start with that?" Well, it's because he
[1:08:20] had to deal with both fronts. There were
[1:08:22] two issues there that had to be dealt
[1:08:23] with at the time. I didn't even rec
[1:08:26] realize that. Looking back, I'm like,
[1:08:27] "Oh, no. That's exactly what had to
[1:08:29] happen."
[1:08:31] Um, but here I am and you know, I'm in
[1:08:34] this moment like, "Oh, Lord, I'm I'm I'm
[1:08:36] saved. I love the Lord. I'm I have the
[1:08:39] Holy Like It was just completely
[1:08:41] reversed all of this these problems in
[1:08:43] in a
[1:08:44] moment." And I'm like, well, I guess I
[1:08:47] gotta go get married
[1:08:49] now. Like, this is
[1:08:53] it. This is in 2019. If any of you know
[1:08:56] when I got married, it's
[1:08:58] 2021.
[1:09:00] Okay, I'm sitting going, I have like, as
[1:09:03] far as I'm concerned, thus sayaeth the
[1:09:05] Lord, I'm going to marry this girl. And
[1:09:09] she did not think that.
[1:09:15] And I'm, you know, she ended up, there's
[1:09:20] just this whole drama that had to
[1:09:22] unfold. And then the whole time I'm in
[1:09:26] agony going, Lord, I thought that this
[1:09:29] was what was going to happen. And now
[1:09:31] it's what do you mean? Did I mess
[1:09:33] something up? Like what
[1:09:35] happened? And I'm trying to make this
[1:09:39] happen. I went and talked to her
[1:09:41] dad. it and she ended up in a courtship
[1:09:45] with somebody
[1:09:48] else and I'm going,
[1:09:51] "Lord, what
[1:09:53] happened?" And I'm just dying like I'm
[1:09:56] I'm shaking. This is this is because
[1:09:59] it's And then of course the devil's
[1:10:00] going to come in. Oh, well, you you were
[1:10:02] so convinced you were going to marry
[1:10:02] this girl. Are you sure you got saved,
[1:10:04] too? You know, and you're dealing with
[1:10:06] all that nonsense. And I'm I'm going
[1:10:09] through this and and you know finally
[1:10:12] after like a year and a half almost two
[1:10:15] years I finally got to the point
[1:10:19] where I
[1:10:22] recognized
[1:10:23] that I'm trying to make this
[1:10:26] happen and I said Lord I can't anymore.
[1:10:30] I can't do this. I'm not going to
[1:10:36] keep pushing to make this happen because
[1:10:40] obviously I can't do it. And maybe I got
[1:10:44] it wrong. Maybe I completely
[1:10:46] misunderstood what was happening. Maybe
[1:10:48] I am a complete lunatic and read
[1:10:51] something into a phrase that my pastor
[1:10:53] said and I just need to stop being a
[1:10:55] weirdo and I'm going to move on. I'm
[1:10:58] going to go find another girl and we'll
[1:11:00] just, you know, if it if it's from you,
[1:11:03] then it'll happen. And I prayed this on
[1:11:05] a Wednesday. By Friday, everything that
[1:11:08] I was trying to make happen for the last
[1:11:10] year and a half got resolved like
[1:11:13] that. Okay? Because it took me number
[1:11:16] one, having to recognize that that the
[1:11:19] two questions were separate questions
[1:11:22] and that one did not rely on the other.
[1:11:25] Right. Right. My relationship with that
[1:11:28] girl had nothing to do with my salvation
[1:11:30] and vice versa. Right? I had to have an
[1:11:34] understanding that the Lord had to show
[1:11:35] me that my salvation was independent of
[1:11:38] that. And I had to have a a rooting and
[1:11:40] a foundation that if I never marry that
[1:11:43] girl, I'm still going to serve the Lord.
[1:11:45] I had to have that nailed down before I
[1:11:49] could move forward. Amen.
[1:11:51] And when I got tamed to that point and
[1:11:53] said, 'Lord, I will serve you regardless
[1:11:55] of what happens and took my hands off of
[1:11:58] it and said,"I going to stop
[1:12:01] doing I'm going to stop trying to make
[1:12:04] the vision happen, the vision will work
[1:12:08] itself out." Amen. And then it
[1:12:11] did because half the problem with the
[1:12:15] reason maybe the reason why the Lord
[1:12:18] can't move in our lives the way we want
[1:12:21] the Lord to move is because we're too
[1:12:24] busy trying to move it. Right? It took
[1:12:28] me realizing that I couldn't make this
[1:12:32] situation happen and for me to just take
[1:12:35] let go of it and give it to God and say,
[1:12:37] "Lord, if it was of you, then you'll
[1:12:38] make it happen." And it took God like
[1:12:41] less than 24 hours to fix it.
[1:12:44] Right. Less than 24 hours. And it took
[1:12:47] me a year and a half to fail.
[1:12:50] Right. a year and a half to break my own
[1:12:53] heart over the
[1:12:56] situation that God could have resolved
[1:12:58] in in hours
[1:13:01] because I was too busy trying to do it
[1:13:05] because oh well, you know, I I'm going
[1:13:07] to move forward on faith. Well, move
[1:13:09] forward on let go. The way you move
[1:13:13] forward is you give it to God and God
[1:13:15] will lay the path out in front of you
[1:13:16] and then you walk on that. Right? If
[1:13:19] you're trying to forge your own path,
[1:13:21] well then you're going to end up in
[1:13:22] somewhere that you don't want to be. I
[1:13:24] can look back and say if it would have
[1:13:26] happened the way I wanted it to happen,
[1:13:28] our marriage would have been a
[1:13:30] catastrophe because I would have had
[1:13:32] spiritual problems and she wouldn't have
[1:13:34] respected me,
[1:13:37] right? There were there were things that
[1:13:39] she had that were need to be worked out
[1:13:40] on her side, too. She had to come to the
[1:13:43] realization of just how awesome I
[1:13:47] was.
[1:13:52] Right.
[1:13:53] And you know
[1:13:58] and but
[1:14:02] and anyways
[1:14:05] um this is but this is important. You do
[1:14:08] it in God's timing because if it's done
[1:14:10] in God's timing, it'll be done with
[1:14:11] God's results,
[1:14:13] right? You do it with the you if you
[1:14:15] want the way if you want it to be the
[1:14:17] way God envisioned it, then you're going
[1:14:18] to have to do it the way God wants you
[1:14:19] to do it, right? You don't get to just
[1:14:22] go rogue on the blueprints and expect to
[1:14:24] get the original design. Okay? You
[1:14:27] don't, you know, I'm an electrician.
[1:14:29] I've had to wire up buildings with um
[1:14:33] according to blueprints. Okay? You don't
[1:14:36] just get to make things up as you go. If
[1:14:40] you do, the building burns down. Okay?
[1:14:45] You you seeing the situ like when when
[1:14:48] God shows you something, you do it in
[1:14:50] the line and order of his word. And by
[1:14:52] the way, if you think the Lord showed
[1:14:54] you something and you're not approaching
[1:14:58] by the you may have been accurate in
[1:15:00] that the Lord may have actually showed
[1:15:03] that to you and it is actually for you
[1:15:05] to to possess, but if you're going to
[1:15:07] approach it in a way that isn't
[1:15:10] scriptural, then God's just going to
[1:15:12] shut that down until you get your your
[1:15:14] act right, until
[1:15:16] you're realigning yourself with the word
[1:15:19] and approaching it properly.
[1:15:22] Right? You
[1:15:24] don't young people, I don't care how
[1:15:28] much you believe that that, you know,
[1:15:31] young man or young girl is the right
[1:15:33] one, they very me way, very well may be,
[1:15:38] you may be 100% accurate in that, but if
[1:15:40] you're approaching them with either one
[1:15:42] of you not saved and full of the Holy
[1:15:44] Ghost, God will shut that down, right?
[1:15:49] and and thank him for it because I
[1:15:51] promise you, you will regret it. Okay?
[1:15:55] Um if you are approaching a healing and
[1:15:59] your lifestyle isn't in accordance with
[1:16:01] the
[1:16:02] word, well, okay, get that sorted,
[1:16:05] right? God's not going the same
[1:16:08] atonement that is for your healing is
[1:16:10] for your salvation. That means you have
[1:16:12] to approach the same in the same
[1:16:14] condition with repentance.
[1:16:17] Okay? The atonement works one way and
[1:16:20] that is with a pure heart both for
[1:16:22] salvation and for healing. And you don't
[1:16:25] get to approach the throne for for
[1:16:27] healing grace. If you ha are full of sin
[1:16:33] doesn't that's that's no go.
[1:16:38] So we need to we need to learn
[1:16:42] to stop making things pushing things
[1:16:46] forward of our own valition. Stop trying
[1:16:49] to make things happen that we don't have
[1:16:51] the power to make happen.
[1:16:54] Right? Uh you know moms and dads
[1:16:59] with look when brother Brandham's
[1:17:02] sitting there and this baby is dying.
[1:17:05] Mom and dad are watching this and and
[1:17:07] melting down. They're screaming because
[1:17:10] they're watching their baby drown for
[1:17:14] hours and it hurts a
[1:17:18] lot and they're having to sit through
[1:17:21] this because it's got to happen on God's
[1:17:23] timing. And no matter how now, I'm sure
[1:17:28] as soon as that baby is up and running
[1:17:30] around and fully healed, mama, the all
[1:17:33] that agony is out the window, right? Not
[1:17:36] it's not even going to come into your
[1:17:37] head of that how rough that
[1:17:40] was. But in the moment, it's really
[1:17:44] going to hurt.
[1:17:47] And a lot of the
[1:17:50] times we're looking at a situation,
[1:17:53] maybe it's a child who's, you know, gone
[1:17:56] astray and we're going, "The rapture is
[1:17:59] going to happen and my baby's going to
[1:18:02] get left
[1:18:04] behind, you know, Lord, what you know,
[1:18:06] and we're we're in agony. We're watching
[1:18:09] this kid's life go to ruin and rubble
[1:18:13] because of their hideous attitude and
[1:18:16] their complete abandonment of of
[1:18:19] God. And we're in agony watching this
[1:18:23] happen. But no matter how much of a
[1:18:26] train wreck that it is, no matter
[1:18:30] how twisted their life becomes because
[1:18:33] of the sin, sickness that is set
[1:18:35] in, you do not let go of that promise.
[1:18:40] No matter how hard it gets, no matter
[1:18:42] how much agony you're going through, you
[1:18:45] recognize that the promise is for you,
[1:18:48] that it is not going anywhere, that God
[1:18:51] gave you a promise, and you're going to
[1:18:52] you're going to hang on to the bitter
[1:18:54] end because the end is not going to be
[1:18:57] bitter. Okay? The end is going to be
[1:19:00] salvation. The end is going to be
[1:19:02] restoration. The end is going to be
[1:19:03] healing. The end is going to be
[1:19:05] beautiful. No matter how miserable
[1:19:09] things are right now, no matter how
[1:19:11] whatever your situation is, whether it's
[1:19:13] healing and all you can see is the
[1:19:15] sickness that's breaking your body every
[1:19:19] day. So what? Lying vanities. Okay. When
[1:19:24] Jonah is in a belly of a
[1:19:28] whale, which be he's only in there
[1:19:31] because he went the wrong
[1:19:32] direction and yet he still holds to a
[1:19:35] promise and says, "Oh, I am surrounded
[1:19:37] by the insides of a
[1:19:39] fish. My head is wrapped up in seaweed.
[1:19:43] Somehow I'm not
[1:19:45] dead. Lying vanities.
[1:19:48] It
[1:19:50] takes something inhuman to look around
[1:19:53] at a fish from the wrong way in and say
[1:19:57] lying vanities.
[1:20:00] But there's only that's just something
[1:20:02] supernatural. Right? That's what you
[1:20:04] have to do. You have to look at your
[1:20:06] situation that goes, "Oh, well the
[1:20:07] doctor said, so what?" Right? We do not
[1:20:12] base our um we do not base our faith on
[1:20:16] the tree of knowledge.
[1:20:18] This is not how Christians operate. You
[1:20:21] base your faith on the tree of life and
[1:20:23] the tree of life gave you a promise and
[1:20:25] you're going to hold that promise
[1:20:27] because the tree of knowledge is full of
[1:20:30] lies. Okay? And you you move forward on
[1:20:33] the word. Young person, you may have the
[1:20:36] Holy Ghost. You're looking at a
[1:20:38] situation in which ah but that that
[1:20:40] other young person that I find so
[1:20:43] fantastic does not have the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:46] Okay. If you really believe that they
[1:20:48] are the one, you will have faith. You
[1:20:53] will pray for them every single day. You
[1:20:55] will pray for their soul. What you will
[1:20:57] not do is go pay play patty cake with
[1:20:59] the devil that's living on them. Okay?
[1:21:02] Because if you do, it will bite you. It
[1:21:05] will ruin you. And you may very well be
[1:21:09] correct in the assumption or in the
[1:21:11] assessment that they are the cor you're
[1:21:14] the right one that God intended for you.
[1:21:16] and you will still ruin your life
[1:21:19] because you got out of God's timing. You
[1:21:21] took the seed that God planted for your
[1:21:23] life that there was going to be a crop
[1:21:25] that you were going to harvest one day
[1:21:26] and you went and plucked it out of the
[1:21:28] ground and said, "I'm going to do this
[1:21:29] my
[1:21:31] way. Don't don't do
[1:21:35] it. I am out of time and gas." Brother
[1:21:40] Tony, we can we can stand and sing a
[1:21:43] song. I'm going to yank the parachute.
[1:21:45] You've heard of helicopter preachers,
[1:21:46] straight up and straight
[1:21:49] down. So, we're going to sing a song. I
[1:21:53] uh half the time don't know when I'm
[1:21:54] running out of material or inspiration
[1:21:58] until I do and then we're going to throw
[1:22:01] the brakes and we're going to get out of
[1:22:03] here. But first, we're going to sing a
[1:22:05] song. What do we What are we singing?
[1:22:09] wait upon the
[1:22:12] Lord shall
[1:22:15] renew their

[1:23:40] wait upon the
[1:23:43] Lord shall

[1:23:50] Let's all come out of our prayer meeting
[1:23:54] with wings
[1:23:56] as
[1:24:00] eagles. They shall run and not be
[1:24:06] weary. They shall walk and not
[1:24:11] faint. Teach me Lord.
[1:24:15] Teach me
[1:24:18] Lord to
[1:24:20] [Music]

[1:24:27] me tonight. So thankful for that.

[1:24:32] convicted. Brother

[1:25:44] mom Trevi in prayer. She has Bell's

[1:25:54] who's in labor at the
[1:25:58] hospital and Sister Hope
[1:26:02] uh has a testimony she wanted to share.
[1:26:05] So, I'll read that. We want to thank
[1:26:07] everyone for praying for Sister Joanne's
[1:26:09] neighbor, June Brock's mother. A few
[1:26:11] months ago, her mother, Denise Sers, was
[1:26:13] diagnosed with stage 4 uterine cancer
[1:26:15] that had spread. And we put in several
[1:26:18] prayer requests on her behalf. The first
[1:26:20] prayer request was for healing and a new
[1:26:23] doctor. The Lord answered immediately
[1:26:25] with a new oncologist. The following
[1:26:27] request was for expedited decisions to
[1:26:30] be made by the oncology team. Just days
[1:26:32] later, they made the decision to put off
[1:26:34] surgery and get her started with chemo
[1:26:37] and immunotherapy. Following the next
[1:26:40] prayer request for Denise to be
[1:26:41] protected from the harsh side effects of
[1:26:43] chemo, the oncologist decided to put her
[1:26:45] on lowdose chemo treatments that are
[1:26:47] designed to allow seniors to maintain
[1:26:49] better health during the process. There
[1:26:51] are more treatments but fewer side
[1:26:53] effects and stress on the b
[1:26:55] body. Finally, brother Jason and the
[1:26:58] ministry team were able to send her a
[1:26:59] prayer cloth cloth. Most recently, I
[1:27:01] received this update from her daughter
[1:27:02] June. My mom is out of surgery.
[1:27:04] Everything went perfectly. They removed
[1:27:07] her uterus, cervix, both ovaries and
[1:27:09] tubes. And there were several signs of
[1:27:12] previous previous tumors, but they

[1:33:49] word. We thank you, Father, for all
[1:33:52] these things, all the blessings that you

[1:34:02] for all of this, Lord, in the name of
[1:34:04] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:34:07] I guess I guess we got a minute for a
[1:34:10] testimony. Anybody? I got a microphone.
[1:34:20] I just want to thank the Lord for my
[1:34:22] five year mile marker uh from being
[1:34:25] cancer
[1:34:26] freeise
[1:34:28] and it's just in my heart that every
[1:34:32] time I think people people already know
[1:34:34] this they don't need to keep rehearing
[1:34:36] it then I'm reminded no this is God's
[1:34:39] testimony this is something that the
[1:34:41] Lord wants people to be reminded ed of
[1:34:43] because it's an encouragement to
[1:34:45] somebody else who may be going through
[1:34:47] that or may go through it in the near
[1:34:49] future. Um that a stage three cancer hit
[1:34:55] me and God delivered me. It's as simple
[1:34:58] as that. And
[1:35:01] um I just pray that it will certainly
[1:35:04] bless somebody and if they need to hear
[1:35:06] it that God will put it upon their ears
[1:35:08] because I needed a lot of encouragement,
[1:35:11] a lot of comfort and love during that
[1:35:14] time. And um the word of the Lord is
[1:35:16] what comforted me on a daily basis from
[1:35:20] my home. So, I listened to the word,
[1:35:22] heard a lot of sermons, and every sermon
[1:35:25] that he picked out for me on YouTube
[1:35:28] from our ministry that's around the
[1:35:30] world was exactly what I needed that
[1:35:33] day. And so, just, you know, I just
[1:35:36] wanted to give the Lord praise and to
[1:35:39] let his testimony continue to be heard.
[1:35:42] And it's been five years. So, I'm so
[1:35:45] thankful.
[1:35:47] [Applause]
[1:35:55] All right. So, about a month or two ago,
[1:35:57] um this problem with my ankle came up. I
[1:36:00] had um I had fell from the stairs and
[1:36:04] hurt my ankle really bad and we had just
[1:36:07] left for this really long trip to
[1:36:09] Chicago. Yeah, a wedding. So, Oh, wait.
[1:36:12] No, that's me. Anyway, sorry. Anyhoo, um
[1:36:16] I I was going to school with this bad
[1:36:19] ankle and we have the steepest stairs
[1:36:21] you could ever see and that hurt really
[1:36:26] bad. So I I had got I had to go through
[1:36:30] this for like weeks. It's really bad.
[1:36:33] Um, a couple a couple days later, um, I
[1:36:37] I just started praying on this and and
[1:36:40] in about one or two weeks, my my ank I'm
[1:36:44] standing on it just fine now. Wonderful.
[1:36:46] I I can I can go up those stairs like
[1:36:49] nobody's business.
[1:36:50] [Music]
[1:36:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:56] I know I can sure enter in with that. I
[1:37:00] uh I'll tell this testimony. I've told
[1:37:01] it before, but I'm going to tell it
[1:37:02] again cuz maybe someone else needs to
[1:37:04] hear it.
[1:37:05] um years ago I blew my knee out going up
[1:37:09] a ladder um going trying to go through
[1:37:11] an attic access and
[1:37:14] um I'm pretty sure just trashed the
[1:37:16] meniscus in my left knee and I for years
[1:37:20] after that off and on had ser bouts with
[1:37:26] knee
[1:37:27] pain and
[1:37:29] um I'd come up for prayer and brother
[1:37:33] Matt prayed for me and he uh had
[1:37:37] actually had the same injury and my dad
[1:37:40] had prayed for him for that injury and
[1:37:44] uh that my dad had anointed his knee
[1:37:46] with oil and and got down on his knees
[1:37:47] and prayed for him at that at the altar.
[1:37:48] So he did the same thing and I got
[1:37:52] healed and then a little while later I
[1:37:56] was preaching on here about holding your
[1:37:58] faith and my knee pain had come back and
[1:38:02] the devil was tormenting me about how
[1:38:04] you're going to preach that and you
[1:38:06] can't hold onto a healing and I preached
[1:38:09] it anyways and walked off the platform
[1:38:11] healed and I've never had that knee pain
[1:38:14] again. It's gone completely.
[1:38:17] So no matter what, even
[1:38:19] if sister, if you got a report tomorrow
[1:38:23] that that cancer was back, you reject it
[1:38:26] just as hard as you did today. You are
[1:38:28] healed no matter what. And I don't care
[1:38:29] what any of y'all are facing. The de you
[1:38:32] have deliverance. You hang on to that no
[1:38:33] matter what the report is. Amen. Anybody
[1:38:36] else got a
[1:38:37] testimony?
[1:38:39] Nobody. All right. Well, praise the
[1:38:40] Lord. I guess we're going to wrap it up.
[1:38:43] We got another song we want to sing or
[1:38:45] We shall mount
[1:38:48] up with wings
[1:38:51] as
[1:38:57] legal shall
[1:38:59] run and not be
[1:39:02] weary. They shall
[1:39:05] walk and
[1:39:08] not teach me Lord.
[1:39:12] Teach me,
[1:39:15] Lord, to wait
[1:39:19] [Music]
[1:39:20] a They that
[1:39:23] wait upon the
[1:39:26] Lord shall
[1:39:30] renew their strength.
[1:39:34] They shall mount
[1:39:37] up with wings
[1:39:40] as
[1:39:45] eagles. They shall
[1:39:48] run and not be
[1:39:51] weary. They shall
[1:39:53] walk and never
[1:39:57] faint. Teach me
[1:40:00] Lord. Teach me Lord.
[1:40:05] to
[1:40:09] wait. Teach me,
[1:40:12] Lord, to
[1:40:15] wait down
[1:40:19] on my
[1:40:22] knees. Still in
[1:40:25] your good time.

[1:40:31] answer my
[1:40:34] please. Teach me
[1:40:37] not to
[1:40:40] reply on what
[1:40:44] others do.
[1:40:47] But to
[1:40:49] wait in
[1:40:52] prayer for an
[1:40:55] answer from you.
