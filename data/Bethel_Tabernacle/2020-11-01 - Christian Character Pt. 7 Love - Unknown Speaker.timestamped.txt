[0:29] [Music]
[0:42] so
[0:48] [Music]
[1:14] good morning everyone god bless you
[1:17] let's stand up and pray
[1:23] gracious heavenly father we just come to
[1:25] you now in the name of jesus christ and
[1:27] we want to
[1:28] dedicate this time to you we asked lord
[1:31] that you would come
[1:32] and you would break open your word to
[1:34] our hearts lord may it not just be a
[1:37] a nice teaching or a nice topic lord but
[1:40] may it be something that
[1:42] penetrates deep into our soul
[1:46] and brings change and transformation and
[1:50] strength
[1:51] strength lord to walk in obedience
[1:55] living the life of this word and so we
[1:58] just commit that to you we ask
[1:59] your holy spirit would come be with
[2:03] the speaker and be with the hearers help
[2:05] help us to
[2:06] get ourselves out of the way that the
[2:08] spirit would flow
[2:10] we ask in jesus name amen amen
[2:13] let's go to our opening scripture romans
[2:17] 12 9 and 10
[2:21] and my topic is christian character
[2:24] this is part 7 and
[2:28] subtitle is love
[2:33] romans 12 9 9-10 let
[2:36] love agape
[2:39] love be without dissimulation
[2:42] abhor that which is evil cleave to that
[2:46] which is good
[2:47] be kindly one to another
[2:51] with brotherly love philadelphia
[2:54] in honor preferring one another
[2:58] may the lord add the blessing to the
[2:59] reading of his word you can be seated
[3:02] so it uses three different
[3:06] words for love in these two verses
[3:09] so uh let love agape
[3:13] be without the simulation and then it
[3:16] goes on it says be
[3:18] kindly affection to one another this
[3:21] word kindly affection is one
[3:25] greek word it's phyllostorgos so it's a
[3:28] combination of
[3:29] filio love and fam storgos speaks of
[3:33] or storge speaks of family love so
[3:37] combined into one word you have
[3:39] brotherly love
[3:41] and family love so be kindly affection
[3:45] have brotherly family love
[3:48] to one to another with and he repeats it
[3:52] again
[3:52] philadelphia so
[3:56] three things three three things put into
[3:59] that verse
[4:00] writing right in that phrase philosoph
[4:03] with philadelphia so it's like he's
[4:06] paul is placing a greater a strong
[4:10] strong emphasis
[4:11] on this and i think sometimes
[4:14] uh in the message we hear the difference
[4:17] between
[4:17] filio and agape and we say agape is
[4:20] better
[4:21] filio's bad no that's that's not right
[4:25] filio is is very good it's encouraged
[4:27] constantly
[4:29] the the the brotherly love is spoken of
[4:33] time and time and time again and it's
[4:36] lift and we'll read some of those it's
[4:37] lifted up as
[4:39] critically important um just to look at
[4:42] agape love because we tend to look at it
[4:46] as simply as divine love that's true
[4:48] it's higher than filio that's true
[4:53] but i want to look at it this way in
[4:56] strong's concordance
[4:57] the kind of the expanded version of that
[5:00] it says agape love
[5:02] is wider embracing especially the
[5:05] judgment
[5:06] and the deliberate ascent of the will as
[5:09] a matter of
[5:09] principle duty and propriety
[5:14] so it's love that is looking
[5:17] at god's purpose for you it's beyond
[5:20] your feelings it's
[5:21] beyond your emotions it's an act of the
[5:24] will
[5:25] to act on god's word regardless of how
[5:28] you feel
[5:30] um brotherly love is more on the on the
[5:33] sense of this
[5:34] is this is an a a common
[5:38] affection that you have for one another
[5:42] it's brotherly you know it's not a love
[5:44] to
[5:45] somebody out in the world walking in in
[5:48] in sinfulness
[5:49] agape love needs to go out there because
[5:51] you're loving them because the bible
[5:53] commands you to love you love your enemy
[5:55] you agape
[5:57] your enemy but you're not gonna you're
[5:59] not gonna have brotherly
[6:00] kindness to someone that hates you
[6:03] you're gonna have agape
[6:04] right so it talks about these different
[6:07] storge it's family love
[6:09] it's not outside of that so when you're
[6:11] looking at this combining
[6:12] filio love storge family love
[6:16] into one another be kindly affectioned
[6:20] one to another with brotherly love it's
[6:24] not a
[6:25] bad thing it's not even it's not even a
[6:27] lower thing
[6:28] it's something that god wants us to have
[6:32] for he each other and i want to just
[6:36] bring it a little bit more real to you
[6:38] is
[6:39] brotherly love is like friendship
[6:43] love filio love is on that level of
[6:47] friendship it's a mutual enjoyment
[6:50] that you have with one another filio
[6:53] is speaking more of this is this is the
[6:57] joy that you get out of being
[6:58] a friend of luther's you know he gives
[7:01] you
[7:02] joy you give him joy it's back and forth
[7:05] agape love says well
[7:07] brother luther is not very fun to be
[7:09] around
[7:11] it's not true but just as an example
[7:13] he's not very fun to be around
[7:14] you know he's always hurting my feelings
[7:18] and uh always always speaking against me
[7:22] no he's not but you know you can you can
[7:25] picture in your mind somebody that's
[7:26] speaking against you
[7:27] fighting against you you are too you're
[7:29] commanded
[7:30] to agape them you're not going to have
[7:35] affection towards that person
[7:38] but you're commanded to love them and to
[7:41] do good to them
[7:43] and so they're you know those things are
[7:45] new
[7:47] you know it's important to understand
[7:49] first thessalonians 4
[7:51] 9 and 10
[7:54] but as touching brotherly love
[7:57] philadelphia
[7:58] you need not that i write unto you for
[8:01] you yourselves
[8:02] are taught of god to agape
[8:06] one another isn't that interesting
[8:09] but as touching filio love
[8:13] i don't need to write i don't even need
[8:14] to write to you you that's just
[8:16] something that you have
[8:17] for each other it's built in
[8:21] your connection to each other as
[8:23] christians
[8:24] there's a brotherly love there and i
[8:27] don't even need to write to you
[8:28] because you are taught of god to agape
[8:31] each other
[8:32] so you see now there's an overlap now
[8:34] we've got an overlap
[8:35] brotherly love is spoken of i don't need
[8:38] to
[8:38] as touching brotherly love i don't need
[8:41] to write to you
[8:41] because you're taught by god to agape
[8:43] each other so when you speak of agape
[8:46] it's also speaking of filio
[8:51] it's within that it's only it's a higher
[8:54] level
[8:55] you know you can have filio towards
[8:58] brother luther because of the enjoyment
[9:00] that you get but then
[9:02] your love has to go a little higher than
[9:04] just that
[9:06] it has to go in well even when he bugs
[9:09] me
[9:11] i still reach out i still pray for him
[9:14] i still do good to him i still treat him
[9:18] with friendliness i still treat him with
[9:20] felio
[9:21] even though i'm not feeling it so to
[9:24] speak
[9:26] because i'm commanded to i'm i'm taught
[9:28] by god to agape
[9:31] and he says indeed and indeed you do it
[9:33] toward all the brethren
[9:35] which are in all macedonia but we
[9:38] beseech you brethren that you
[9:39] increase more and more
[9:42] so increasing more and more
[9:45] in phileo and agape
[9:50] first thessalonians two seven through
[9:53] eight
[9:55] but we were gentle among you even as a
[9:57] nurse
[9:58] nurse cherishes her children so being
[10:01] affectionately desirous of you we were
[10:04] willing to have
[10:05] imparted unto you not the gospel of god
[10:07] only
[10:08] but also our own souls because you were
[10:12] dear unto us agapetos
[10:15] is this word it means beloved you are
[10:18] beloved unto us
[10:20] so paul is speaking there again of agape
[10:23] they were dear
[10:24] precious again filio
[10:27] speaking of friendship it's not
[10:30] disparaging way of talking about love
[10:34] it's a christian virtue that's to be
[10:37] lived
[10:38] we're taught of god we don't need to be
[10:41] taught
[10:41] to do it because god himself teaches us
[10:44] to agape one another and we have to
[10:47] grow more and more
[10:51] in love
[10:54] and so this is in a lot of ways
[10:58] this is talking about christian
[11:00] friendship
[11:02] christian friendship is not just on the
[11:04] level of filio
[11:06] you know we talk about friendship it has
[11:07] to be better there is a friend that's
[11:09] closer
[11:10] than a brother there but they're a
[11:12] friend
[11:14] but it's a better it's a better friend
[11:16] why is that because it's a christian
[11:17] friend
[11:18] they're going to correct you and you
[11:19] need correction they're going to take
[11:21] care of you
[11:22] when you have a need there's something
[11:24] greater than that because
[11:25] it's not just filio it's also agape
[11:29] both of them together and again i'm not
[11:33] i'm not preaching on this to say i
[11:35] expect
[11:36] you guys to treat me this way take care
[11:39] of me this way this isn't what this is
[11:40] about this is just simply about this is
[11:43] scripture this is
[11:44] this is love and we
[11:48] it struck me that we talk about
[11:52] friendship and we look at it as sort of
[11:55] a secondary thing but i think it's
[11:57] really a part of the family of god
[12:00] filio filo storgos
[12:04] a brotherly family love
[12:07] that he tells us to have and that's
[12:10] that's what we need
[12:11] and we need to grow into it more and
[12:12] more the christian ethic
[12:15] is not selfish self-centered not what we
[12:19] can get out of it
[12:21] it is let every man seek not
[12:24] his own good but the good
[12:27] of others
[12:31] but in relationships friendships
[12:35] every relationship husband and wife
[12:38] just like nature if it's untended
[12:43] it tends towards wildness it tends
[12:46] towards
[12:47] isolation so if you leave a friendship
[12:50] alone you don't put any effort you don't
[12:51] do anything
[12:52] what happens you're automatically
[12:55] isolated that's how friendships go
[12:58] that's how marriages can go
[13:00] if you don't put effort into it
[13:04] you separate you might live still in the
[13:06] same house but you still
[13:09] from your heart you separate from one
[13:12] another and so
[13:13] this christian ethic of friendship
[13:17] of filial love is something that
[13:21] takes what effort
[13:25] work thought it's not just something
[13:28] well i just
[13:30] i just go i just go with the flow
[13:33] no we can't go with the light life's
[13:35] flow or even our hearts flow we got to
[13:38] go with the words flow
[13:40] we got to live our lives by that
[13:43] love that's in us like we talked about
[13:45] last week we have love inside of us shed
[13:48] abroad by the holy ghost but we have to
[13:50] take off our blinders we get so focused
[13:52] on our own life
[13:54] our own devices both metaphorical and
[13:58] actual devices
[13:59] we're so focused on that we don't see
[14:02] anything
[14:03] that's going out on around us and so the
[14:06] love just kind of stays right here right
[14:08] in front of us
[14:09] we have to take the blinders off and let
[14:12] love
[14:13] that's flowing into us flow out of us
[14:16] and so again
[14:20] like nature friendships relationships of
[14:23] any kind
[14:25] move towards ice isolation
[14:28] past hurts frustrations lead to
[14:31] isolation
[14:33] and not to fellowship not to love
[14:36] look what jesus says i think this is
[14:38] just so stunning in john 15
[14:41] verse 15. this should give us
[14:45] such a beautiful viewpoint of what
[14:47] friendship really is
[14:50] henceforth i call you not servants for
[14:53] the servant knows not what his lord
[14:56] doeth but i called you
[14:59] friends for all things that i have heard
[15:02] of my father i have made
[15:04] known unto you jesus defines
[15:08] friendship right here and it's a
[15:11] beautiful definition
[15:13] friendship is opening up your heart
[15:18] and your secrets to another person
[15:21] amen connecting two
[15:24] hearts together in oneness
[15:27] in christ that's what that's the dif
[15:30] uh person that's a servant you don't
[15:32] tell them what you're doing you just
[15:33] make a commandment go and do it
[15:35] jesus said i i want you to do this and
[15:38] i'm gonna tell you the reason why i want
[15:40] you to do this
[15:41] i'm going to unfold this mystery this
[15:44] secret to you
[15:45] so that you understand it so that you go
[15:47] and walk
[15:48] in obedience to that if you love me keep
[15:51] my commandments
[15:52] you know there's that love that
[15:54] friendship
[15:55] that connection
[15:59] that type of friendship though it
[16:01] demands
[16:03] loyalty and it demands trustworthiness
[16:07] it demands fighting the spirit of gossip
[16:12] because if when your heart is open to
[16:14] someone
[16:15] and they betray that
[16:19] what happens there's hurt and the
[16:21] openness closes
[16:23] and so how precious do we need need to
[16:26] treat
[16:27] the friendships that we have the people
[16:29] that were around the
[16:31] body in the body of christ we can't
[16:34] betray one another
[16:35] you know scripture is so clear and
[16:38] that's a whole sermon in itself about
[16:41] gossip and betrayal and
[16:42] and so forth but
[16:46] you know that type of friendship that
[16:48] jesus is talking about not the world's
[16:50] type of friendship
[16:51] not america's type of friendship or
[16:53] egypt's type of friendship or africa's
[16:56] the bible type of friendship actually it
[16:59] exposes you to the possibility of being
[17:02] hurt and having your having trust
[17:05] broken but
[17:08] didn't it expose jesus christ to the
[17:10] very same thing
[17:12] it never stopped him didn't prevent him
[17:15] he made himself transparent to us and
[17:18] for us and yes he didn't
[17:20] he spoke in parables to those outside
[17:22] but to those
[17:24] on the inside he spoke openly his heart
[17:27] and even they ran away from him even
[17:30] they left him
[17:31] alone and it shouldn't
[17:34] because of that possibility of hurt
[17:38] and broken trust it shouldn't prevent us
[17:42] from doing what scripture wants us to do
[17:46] it opens our us up to hurt but
[17:49] eventually you get to this place where
[17:51] you realize
[17:52] that comes with the territory of being
[17:54] obedient to the lord
[17:56] you're gonna get hurt i mean bad
[17:59] most of you probably have by people that
[18:02] confess to be
[18:04] christians is that now
[18:08] absolve you of the responsibility of
[18:10] scripture
[18:11] no it doesn't it doesn't
[18:14] jesus you know you can certainly look at
[18:17] it and understand there's different
[18:18] levels of friendship
[18:20] right from scripture jesus had the 12
[18:23] but then he also had the three
[18:24] his most trusted um and so that you know
[18:28] that's okay as we're not really looking
[18:29] at that
[18:30] here but i i know people in their minds
[18:32] might say well
[18:34] jesus had different layers of friendship
[18:37] so i can have the same too
[18:38] well yep absolutely
[18:41] absolutely but he opened his heart up to
[18:44] all he didn't make a division
[18:47] between in john 15 between
[18:50] you know peter james and john and the
[18:52] rest of the twelve
[18:53] he opened himself up to all of them
[18:56] and the heart of a true servant lays
[18:58] down his life for the brethren
[19:01] and i'll put an extra thing on that
[19:04] expecting nothing in return
[19:08] is when you expect some many times our
[19:11] hurts are from our expectations of other
[19:13] people
[19:14] if you expect that i'm here to serve i'm
[19:17] here to open myself up to others
[19:20] so that they can be ministered unto and
[19:23] you expect
[19:24] that you're gonna people are gonna hurt
[19:26] you
[19:27] then you're not gonna be disappointed
[19:31] you're not gonna be disappointed but you
[19:33] still
[19:34] in order to help people you have to open
[19:36] yourself
[19:37] up to people it's so critical
[19:41] at the heart of every believer is to
[19:42] minister to others not just the preacher
[19:44] behind the pulpit
[19:46] every believer you know there needs to
[19:48] be an atmosphere in the body of christ
[19:50] where all of us
[19:52] are reaching out and maintaining godly
[19:55] friendships
[19:56] with those people we should we should
[19:58] have laser focus
[20:00] is someone hurting that person's hurting
[20:02] i need to pray
[20:03] lord how can i approach that person not
[20:06] just saying
[20:07] blinders on i come to church i love the
[20:09] word amen
[20:11] it's good get in my car gone no
[20:15] have your eyes ask god to open your eyes
[20:18] give you a vision for those who are
[20:21] in need who are hurting who need to be
[20:24] reached out
[20:25] to that's all that's the ministry of the
[20:28] body
[20:29] of christ the preacher is to equip
[20:32] the saints for the work of the ministry
[20:35] not just to do the work of the ministry
[20:37] they're to equip you to do the serving
[20:41] not of the preacher of one another you
[20:44] know it's every joint
[20:45] supplying that strength and that
[20:48] blessing to the other joints
[20:50] as the scripture talk talks about
[20:53] but the fact is we know that there are
[20:55] people that are are broken
[20:58] they've been hurt deeply and they feel
[21:02] like they can't open themselves up to
[21:04] others
[21:06] and that's okay
[21:09] there's a bomb in gilead isn't there
[21:12] there's healing
[21:13] you need to seek healing but i'm going
[21:16] to tell you find the fellowship of a
[21:18] true
[21:18] friend someone that will listen to you
[21:22] [Music]
[21:23] and will pray with you about your hurts
[21:26] and through
[21:27] your hurts because god doesn't want you
[21:29] to be in that position where you're so
[21:31] broken
[21:32] that you can't be a genuine friend and
[21:35] minister to others
[21:38] you're not just here to absorb stuff
[21:40] you're here
[21:41] to be someone for someone else
[21:45] not for yourself for someone else
[21:50] you know the bible obviously we'll go
[21:52] through the scriptures probably not this
[21:54] time but next time
[21:55] puts a great value upon friendship but
[21:57] it especially puts
[21:59] an emphasis on it as having the right
[22:02] kind of friends that point you
[22:06] in the right direction doesn't just
[22:09] willy-nilly say have friends
[22:12] in proverbs and throughout the
[22:13] scriptures it speaks very
[22:15] pointedly and carefully about the types
[22:18] of advisors you have
[22:20] see they're not my advisors it's just my
[22:21] friends
[22:23] don't work that way i'm sorry if they're
[22:25] a friend they become an advisor to you
[22:28] and you better be careful what kind of
[22:30] advice you're getting
[22:32] is it word advice is it scriptural does
[22:34] it follow in line with the message of
[22:36] the hour
[22:37] or is it just pop culture science
[22:41] psychology nonsense that is peddled on
[22:45] facebook and everywhere else
[22:48] what kind of friend do you have the
[22:50] bible says have the right
[22:52] friend that leads you in the right
[22:56] direction if you look in
[23:00] baker's dictionary of the bible
[23:04] it looks at the word friend and it says
[23:06] most of the old testament words
[23:08] translated friend friendship or be
[23:10] friendly
[23:12] come from several hebrew roots
[23:15] new testament it speaks of several
[23:18] different
[23:18] words that are used we've talked about
[23:20] one of a couple of those ones
[23:24] as we look at this there's really three
[23:28] types or levels of friendship
[23:32] you know there's association which is
[23:34] you go to school together
[23:36] attend the same church work together go
[23:38] to the same
[23:39] workout facility a fellow member of
[23:43] whatever you know that's an association
[23:47] but then there's association plus
[23:49] loyalty
[23:51] you know there's an association or
[23:53] relationship between yourself and that
[23:54] person
[23:56] and you're loyal to them you defend them
[23:57] you care for them you stand with them
[24:00] in adversity and then there is a
[24:03] friendship that's association
[24:05] plus loyalty plus affection you not only
[24:09] defend this type of person but you also
[24:10] have
[24:11] a great attachment
[24:15] to them and so of course
[24:19] there's great danger in the wrong
[24:22] attachments
[24:24] great danger in it so you have to watch
[24:27] yourself
[24:28] and watch your heart if you if you come
[24:31] to this place
[24:32] where you're so attached to that person
[24:35] it can become actual an actual idolatry
[24:38] that you're worshiping that person
[24:42] instead of worshiping god because you're
[24:44] so dependent
[24:46] on them that's that's the danger as
[24:49] christians
[24:51] we're to be dependent on christ yes we
[24:54] need one another
[24:56] but at the end of the day who is the
[24:59] person
[25:00] that satisfies your heart's desire
[25:03] and need it can't be
[25:06] your friend this one that one you're
[25:08] committing idolatry
[25:11] when you're doing that the one that
[25:12] satisfies your soul
[25:14] has to be jesus christ and and when
[25:18] you're
[25:18] when you're in that position where your
[25:20] friendship
[25:22] you couldn't see yourself breaking up
[25:24] breaking off the friendship for any
[25:26] reason
[25:27] any way that you'll die if you
[25:30] if you don't you're out of balance
[25:33] you're out of whack you know you you
[25:36] have to
[25:37] see that person as someone you're
[25:40] serving for the sake of jesus christ
[25:46] examples of friendship in the old
[25:49] testament first samuel 19
[25:52] verse 1 and saul spake to jonathan his
[25:55] son
[25:56] and to all his servants that they should
[25:59] kill david here's not only the king but
[26:02] his
[26:03] very father says kill david
[26:07] then verse 2 it says but jonathan saul's
[26:09] son delighted much in david
[26:12] and jonathan told david saying saul my
[26:14] father seeks to kill thee
[26:16] now therefore i pray thee take heed to
[26:18] thyself until the morning and abide in a
[26:19] secret place
[26:21] and hide thyself verse 4 and jonathan
[26:24] spake good of david unto saul his father
[26:26] and said unto him let not the king sin
[26:28] against his servant
[26:30] against david because he has not sinned
[26:31] against thee and because his works have
[26:33] been
[26:34] to the word very good and of course
[26:38] saul became angry with jonathan
[26:41] but here's jonathan being a loyal
[26:45] friend and i think this is so important
[26:49] because you know the next verse i'm
[26:52] looking at proverbs 17 17 a friend loves
[26:55] at all times
[26:56] and a brother is born for adversity this
[26:59] some this is something that struck me
[27:02] because uh doing missions work
[27:06] with iranians for years there was so
[27:08] much
[27:09] turmoil and people
[27:12] people there were really against brother
[27:15] petros
[27:17] and they would come and they would meet
[27:18] with me privately and tell me all kinds
[27:20] of bad things about
[27:21] brother petros and uh for a while i
[27:24] would just
[27:25] out of respect just listen to them tell
[27:28] it and
[27:29] and then say well thanks for telling me
[27:30] i'll pray about that and move on
[27:33] and i was listening to a uh
[27:36] lamplighter audio
[27:40] drama and i'm trying to remember what
[27:43] the white gypsy i think it's called in
[27:46] and the one character had a had a friend
[27:49] had a had a friend who was so close to
[27:51] him it was
[27:52] he grew up he was adopted by them and he
[27:54] was in the home and they were so close
[27:56] together and
[27:57] and uh someone spoke another kid was a
[27:59] friend with him
[28:01] and he started speaking bad against the
[28:03] other guy's friend
[28:06] and he said right away he cut him off
[28:08] and said
[28:09] you can't talk that way about my friend
[28:12] he's like a brother to me
[28:16] if you're going to speak that way this
[28:18] conversation and this friendship is over
[28:20] with
[28:21] and it it's i was so convicted
[28:24] i said what have i been doing petros has
[28:27] proven himself as a loyal
[28:30] friend and i'm sitting here listening to
[28:32] people tell me bad about him
[28:35] i should be upset i should be fresh i
[28:37] should tell them to stop
[28:38] that they have no right to do that and
[28:40] that has become a principle to me
[28:45] you know in in situations with missions
[28:48] that people have come and said i need to
[28:49] tell you about something
[28:51] over here before you talk you should
[28:52] understand i've been friends with this
[28:54] person for five years
[28:55] i've fought through many fires and and
[28:58] bloody battles
[28:59] spiritually speaking so before you speak
[29:02] understand
[29:04] my relationship with this person and
[29:06] they say never mind
[29:09] and that you know a friend is born
[29:12] for adversity lord help us to to be
[29:16] that person that stands with and for
[29:19] our friends because of the love of
[29:21] christ that constrains us
[29:23] let's stand as we pray
[29:28] heavenly father take these words and
[29:32] may they go into our hearts lord
[29:35] may just work them out in a
[29:38] practical basis within us help us to
[29:42] live this word with all our hearts
[29:45] live this love to love our neighbors as
[29:49] ourselves

[29:53] this hour
