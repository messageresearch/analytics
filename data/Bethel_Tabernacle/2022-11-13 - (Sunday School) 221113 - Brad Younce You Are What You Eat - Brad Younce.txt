TRANSCRIPT
========================================
blood to the doorpost first even if they did roast the lamb just like the prophet said the death angel would have steal God in the room they would have perished because there wasn't any blood to protect them we can eat this word and gain a head knowledge but if we don't apply the blood to our lives and get Washed by the blood we will perish just like the rest I can see that little Sun it's a little boy in our city his father watched his father kill the lamb and take in the blood and spreading on the door what are you doing pop he said I'm applying the blood to her home because the death angel is going to pass and those that have the blood will die he said father you sure the blood's still there he'd go out and look and say it's still there that's what we need to do as fathers we need to apply the blood to our house apply the token so those kids would have confidence this house is covered by the blood go take another look dad you look around and say yes son he's still there how he said my blood is still there don't worry devil can't cross the bloodline Hallelujah they were told to eat the lamb after the blood was applied and the lamb was cooked over fiery we can't start eating the lamb this word until the blood has been applied to our doorpost the soul and been set on fire with the Holy Ghost and then we start eating our lamb our word not until we have fire of God down in the soul can we start feeding on the body word of the son of man just like Israel eating their lamb it was given them the strength they would need for the body to get ready for travel we are eating our way to a body change to a Rapture eat more eat more of this word feed on this word verse 8 says they shall eat the Flesh in that night and roast with fire unleavened bread with bitter herbs they shall eat it well around State communion was held first way down in Egypt the first of the communion which was the Passover Lamb that was slain which was a type of Christ and when they come out there wasn't a feeble one among them and there even their clothes was not even threadbare for 40 years God had kept them and in taking communion was a difference between life and death those who are on the inside under the shed blood took to communion and no one could take communion outside being under the shed blood this right here is a matter of life and death this right here is a matter of life and death Hallelujah they must come under the blood first and be cleansed from all sin which is unbelief and then be shot with the preparation of the Gospel having the whole armor of God ready for summons at any time we got to be ready at any time because the summons is coming it was a sign that a death angel could not go beneath that blood the death angel had to rise up and go over the blood and theirs were the post Point got the inspiration saying when I see the blood I will pass over you verse 9 says eat not of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast it with fire his head with his legs with the pertinence thereof they were to eat the entire lamb and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that wish remaineth of it until morning you shall burn with fire brother I said none of it is to remain everything he said when you eat it don't eat it raw or sodden but you must eat it well cooked people try to chew on this word they try to eat this word they take it like it was raw chew on and spit it spit it on it and everything else oh I can't take that he says I can't stand it is it cooked done enough and he says cook it with fire fire represents the Holy Ghost you get God in your heart first it'll cook it for you it'll cook it for you Hallelujah cook it with fire that's right cooked it out done seasoned and it tastes good except you eat the Flesh of the son of man what do you think a doctor would have thought sitting there when he says you have to eat my flesh and drink my blood this man's a vampire not a minister stay away from that man he's crazy stay away from him except you eat it he says you'll perish you all die if you don't eat it that's the same thing today the bread and the wine is only a symbol don't let the natural get you down you've got to eat Christ which is the word that you live by every word that precedes out of his mouth the son of man is Christ he's the one you're feeding on oh if he says you hadn't fit fully on every word to give yourself strength to Fly Above these denominations and the things of the world you'll never get over it verse 11 and you shall eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover it's the same it's the same today as in Egypt when he ate the lamb they were to dress to leave as that's this bride we have our helmet our shield on well we have our shield in our shoes or and or we are eating we're ready we're ready to go we're still fighting but we're also eating we're dressed and we're ready for this battle we're here for this journey eat this message eat this word and you'll see your body change right before your eyes verse 12 and I will pass to the legend of Egypt this night will Smite all the first born in the land of Egypt both man and Beast against all gods of Egypt I will execute judgment for I am the Lord Hallelujah John chapter 6 verse 15 1 he says I am the living bread which came down from heaven that's who we're feasted on he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh and I will give for the life of the world and the Jews therefore stroke among himself saying how could this man give us his flesh to eat and then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat which is consume and devour except you Devour the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life whosoever eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up in the last day for my flesh is meet indeed and my blood is drink indeed and he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwells in me and I in him has the living father has sent me I live by the father so that he eateth me even he shall live by me and that is the bread which come down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead and he that eateth of this bread shall live forever that's what we're eating on the body word of the son of man you are what you eat what are you eating Jeremiah 15 16 says the words were found and I did eat them and Thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart for I am called by thy name oh first you got to apply the blood to get Sanctified cleaned out baptized get your house in order this house get rid of sin 11. get it out of your home you got to get your shoes on get dressed for the journey eat the word eat this lamb eat all of it you can't just have you can't pick out what you like it's not a menu you're right you just can't go through here and say I want this part oh I can't eat that you've got to eat the entire word these Jews they come up each year there was a fountains inside the church and they taken the bread and the bitter herbs and the lamb they drink from this fountain in the church and they Rejoice together because that God had showed them favor so this being the Passover time it was a special Passover that's sometimes we go to church and we always love to go I do and there are sometimes that something special happens yeah I expect something special to happen today and this was one of those times talk about children of Israel in her house get ready to go the air was charged with expectancy just as it is today are we expecting something are we expecting a Rapture there's a charge in the air the air is charged with expectancy we are expecting an exodus once again eat this word not just part of it you gotta eat it all all the eyes were of those who loved him was watching for him to come to the gate and I believe it's a great deal that way today for those who love him are looking for him the air is charged with expectancy it's almost Rapture morning it's almost Resurrection morning eat the word these things of the world won't matter to you it don't matter if your favorite football team won or lost all that stuff used to bother me until I got saved I guess because I got used to my team losing so I got used to it because of what you're eating now your diet has been changed we're no longer feasting on the world we're feasting on God the Holy Spirit feeds on the word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God that's what's the matter one of these things today that makes the church in the anemic condition is because it don't take time to feed the word feed on the word the church is hungry if I was a doctor and a great big Stout looking man come to me and said sir I'm sick what are your symptoms I'm so weak I can't hardly pick my hands up ask him a few physical conditions yeah that's right well sir have you been eating regularly oh I hate a half a cracker day before yesterday he says you're just hungry you need strength you need to eat that's what's the matter with the church today just read a little scripture one other verse on a Sunday morning we ought to have our head this word every minute we have to spare and take a lot of time and lay something else besides to read to that word man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God our Delight should be in the word of the Lord to meditate on God's word as it says in Psalms 1. we can't keep the victory because of what we're feeding on we can't feed on the world and the things of the world we will never be victorious we go from service to service barely making it through wow barely made some some of us is going to be coming to the Gate of Heaven and we just fall through the door we don't have the strength enough to make it to the gate I'm telling you where your strength is today we're going to have to have strength because we can't take a Rapture without it Hallelujah you got five minutes I better hurry eating our way to a body change Hallelujah forgot something here that's when we get get to real quick went ahead and skipped a little bit I could see that should have Israel down in Egypt when they're sitting there eating the lamb and the old Grandpa's sitting over there feeble can hardly move I can see the somebody in the house say here take this word right here faith is a substance of things hoped for and he started chewing on it he started getting a little strong he felt something starting to change in him he said here take this the spoken word is the Original Seed he started eating on that the more he ate the stronger he got Hallelujah the next one he said you got to eat this one dad the rapture he started eating that and then they got the summons he got stronger he said what do you got more for me it's the coming of the lord it's Exodus time oh brother sister keep your head in this word it's Rapture time the more you eat the stronger you become that's why the Bible says there was not a feeble one among them it's all because of what they eat the night of the Exodus so what are you eating the night of the Resurrection if tomorrow morning was the resurrection what are you going to be eating you are what you eat so if you're eating the word you become the resurrection you'll become the word of God speaking I feel like preaching but I'll leave that to the preacher here in a little bit hallelujah what are you eating on just ask yourself that question you are what you eat you become it he's like that caterpillar before we become a butterfly he starts munching around over he starts eating and the more he eat the more his body starts changing one day he started fluttering and grew wings and started flying that's what we're going to be one day we might be a little caterpillar but the more we eat we're gonna Sprout wings hallelujah we're gonna Sprout rings and we're going to take away this Rapture we're going Lord let it be today I want today to be the resurrection I'm eating my way to the Rapture let's all stand I thought we'd just thank you for this little messed up thought Lord but father I hope I got it across father knowing that we're going to eat our way into a Rapture father Lord we come hungry father may you bless this service the singing the special singing most of our brothers he brings forth the word you know what's on his heart God father May that anointing just drop down lord and speak to us and give us things we have need of we'll give you the praise in Jesus name amen bless you
