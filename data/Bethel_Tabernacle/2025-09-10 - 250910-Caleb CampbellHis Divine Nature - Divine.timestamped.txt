[31:07] And you know, we showed some natural
[31:10] examples of the experiences that Moses
[31:13] had with the Lord, you know, when he
[31:15] first came into contact with the angel
[31:18] of the Lord and how the Bible said that
[31:20] it was upon the mountain of God. Amen.
[31:23] And it was in the form of a pillar of
[31:25] fire. And then through much of Moses's
[31:28] ministry, through the through the book
[31:29] of Exodus, much of the time that God
[31:31] would speak to Moses, it was on top of a
[31:33] mountain. Amen. Uh first it was Mount
[31:36] Horeb. And then we see through the
[31:37] progression of his ministry that it was
[31:40] uh on Mount Si and eventually it would
[31:42] get to a place where he was in such
[31:46] close contact to the Lord. The Bible
[31:48] says that he would speak to him as a
[31:51] friend would speak to face to face.
[31:53] Amen. And and we see how the Lord had a
[31:57] plan that he was going to change the
[31:58] whole world. Amen. With just the man and
[32:01] with the message. And you know, I was
[32:03] just looking at a little history uh
[32:04] lesson the other day after I had
[32:06] preached that sermon on the on the
[32:08] kingdoms. And you know, you go back and
[32:10] you start to study the the the rise of
[32:13] powers. You know, Egypt goes all the way
[32:15] back to um Ham there in the Bible, one
[32:18] of Noah's sons. He had four sons, one of
[32:20] which was Misraam, which eventually uh
[32:24] went on to start the nation of Egypt.
[32:26] And then e Egypt rose to be this this
[32:28] nation of great power as we read about
[32:31] in the book of Genesis. And we watch how
[32:34] through the book of Genesis uh Joseph
[32:37] was a great contributor in that. Amen.
[32:39] There in in Genesis when Pharaoh he had
[32:42] that dream of the future, you know, with
[32:44] with with the cows and and he sought out
[32:47] the interpretation for what that dream
[32:49] meant. And it just so happened that at
[32:52] that very time, Joseph sat in a prison
[32:55] in his kingdom. Amen. And he had he had
[32:58] already interpreted a dream for one of
[33:00] the Pharaoh's officials. So, and we know
[33:03] the history there. But you know, I was
[33:05] just reading through Genesis and it said
[33:08] that all people gathered from all over
[33:11] the world at this time. All countries
[33:14] came to Joseph because God had put him
[33:16] in a place where he had stored that
[33:18] grain because of the wisdom of God in
[33:22] Joseph. Amen. There was a wisdom that
[33:24] was placed in Joseph and for a purpose
[33:26] and for a time. And that nation grew to
[33:29] be one of the greatest in the world.
[33:33] um the famine and as we read that we the
[33:35] famine got to be so great that it
[33:37] actually you know affected the entire
[33:40] world. People were uh they were selling
[33:43] part of their land to Joseph you know
[33:45] even in order you go back and read that
[33:47] they would sell like a fifth part of
[33:49] their land just so that they could have
[33:51] food to eat you know and that was
[33:52] actually what brought upon the
[33:54] reconciliation of uh of Jacob and or of
[33:59] Jacob's sons with Joseph. Thanks bro.
[34:01] and was because they had a need for
[34:04] food. They because they were living in a
[34:06] famine. So, Jacob sent them off to go
[34:09] and get food. You know, we're all
[34:10] familiar with the story, but they sent
[34:12] them off and then that was started that
[34:14] started a road to reconciliation. Amen.
[34:16] And you start to go and you read the
[34:18] story of Joseph, it's always been one of
[34:20] my favorites because, you know, from the
[34:22] from the beginning of his life, you
[34:25] know, he he got put in slavery and then
[34:27] he had to work and then he got put in
[34:30] this position and then, you know, then
[34:31] he was put in prison. Amen. And so it
[34:33] was just there was this happening in his
[34:35] life. But then he rose to this place and
[34:37] he had always dreamed about that place,
[34:40] but he finally had rose to that place
[34:42] and it took training. God trained him
[34:45] throughout his life to be able to reach
[34:48] a point where when Jacob got or when the
[34:51] when his brothers got to him, he was
[34:54] able to have a place in his heart to
[34:56] say, "God didn't God didn't mean it for
[34:58] evil. You meant it for evil, but God
[35:01] meant it for good." Amen. And that is
[35:03] the stages of growth in our life. God
[35:06] takes you through things. Sometimes, you
[35:08] know, it can be ordained of God in a
[35:10] situation, but he takes you through
[35:12] seasons of growth and seasons of
[35:14] training. So that when you are able to
[35:15] confront that thing later in life,
[35:17] sometimes it is later in life where
[35:19] you're able to confront that thing and
[35:21] recognize that, well, this was actually
[35:23] the hand of God working. And we, you
[35:25] know, we re realize, we're going to get
[35:26] into this in a minute. We realize that
[35:27] it was actually the hand of God that was
[35:30] working with the Jews and with Nazi. It
[35:32] was, that was actually the divine hand
[35:34] of God doing that. Amen.
[35:37] And so uh you you know this famine it
[35:40] affected the whole world and people were
[35:43] um they were actually selling part of
[35:44] their land to Joseph and we see you know
[35:47] how that was that was all in the hand of
[35:49] God and the nation grew and it would be
[35:53] at the hand of God that the nation grew
[35:55] and it would be at the hand of God that
[35:58] the nation would fall. Amen. Amen.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; And then the prophecy came forth that
[36:02] the people would suffer in bondage for
[36:04] for several hundred years. And and as
[36:07] the scripture shows us, it was it was
[36:09] after the death of Joseph. Then another
[36:12] ruler rose up that knew not Joseph or
[36:15] what he had done for Egypt. Amen. And
[36:18] then slavery began. And then during that
[36:20] time of of slavery, the kingdom of Egypt
[36:24] continued to grow and it continued to
[36:26] develop. Amen. you they were working for
[36:29] a purpose and that purpose was to make
[36:31] the kingdom of Egypt greater. Amen. And
[36:34] then we reach the time of Moses and
[36:37] again another story that I love because
[36:40] you know brother Renom he dramatizes
[36:42] that so beautifully how Jockabed and how
[36:44] um Amra and how they were praying and
[36:46] they were praying for a deliverer and
[36:49] and God answered their prayer in in the
[36:51] form of Moses. Amen. But then we we
[36:54] talked about the stages that that uh
[36:56] Moses had to go go through and had to
[36:59] call Moses out of Egypt. He had to call
[37:02] him out in separation. Amen. And then
[37:05] once he had been thoroughly separated
[37:08] from the rest of the world, God was
[37:13] finally then able to get a hold of his
[37:15] life and fulfill the purpose that he had
[37:17] always intended to fulfill in his life.
[37:20] Amen. And it was there on the backside
[37:22] of the desert that that would happen.
[37:24] And on on Sunday the service, we we
[37:27] brought out how that scripture there in
[37:29] Exodus 3 where it says that Moses turned
[37:31] aside to see what the strange thing was.
[37:35] Amen. So he he turned aside to see that
[37:38] there was this strange happening that it
[37:40] was there was a pillar of fire and and
[37:42] it caught his attention and it tracked
[37:44] it attracted his eyes. Amen. And then,
[37:47] you know, we we we went on and we saw
[37:49] how God had to God gave him specific
[37:53] instructions. Amen. Before he stepped on
[37:56] holy ground, he had to take off his
[37:59] shoes. Amen. He had to be obedient to
[38:02] the word that God gave him. Amen. In
[38:05] order to move from where he was and to
[38:08] from where he had been to where God
[38:10] needed him to be. Amen. There had to be
[38:13] a a calling out from you. You're you
[38:15] were this way for a time, but now I'm
[38:18] calling you to this thing for this time.
[38:20] Amen. I'm calling you to a higher place.
[38:22] We're on the mountain. We're on we're in
[38:24] the place. You you see my you see my
[38:26] presence. You see the pillar of fire.
[38:28] But he called him out and he said, "Take
[38:30] off your shoes, Moses, for this place is
[38:32] holy ground." Amen.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; And he he was obedient, amen, to that in
[38:37] order to fulfill that commission. But
[38:40] what what we what we caught was what we
[38:43] looked at is that it had to be more than
[38:45] just something that captured his
[38:47] attention. Amen. It had to be more than
[38:50] him just looking at it from a distance.
[38:52] It had to be more than just something
[38:54] that that he he he sympathized with.
[38:57] Amen. And the word has to be more than
[38:59] just something that we sympathize with.
[39:01] It has to be something that envelops our
[39:04] life. Amen. And there's a working God
[39:06] only calls you. You don't call God.
[39:08] Amen. So, you know that if there's a
[39:10] working and a desire in your heart, then
[39:11] you know that it's the divine hand of
[39:13] God calling you. Amen. So, if he's
[39:16] calling you to that, then there's
[39:17] something that he wants for you. Amen.
[39:19] There's a divine purpose in that. He's
[39:21] calling you to a higher place. Amen. And
[39:24] and that's what he's doing tonight. He's
[39:26] calling us to a higher place. Amen.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; It's got to be more than just something
[39:30] that that that people sympathize with. I
[39:32] didn't read this quote last time, but
[39:33] it's been burning on my heart. It's
[39:35] probably familiar to most of you, but
[39:36] brother Random says, "Now, many people
[39:38] sympathize. Many people say it's right,
[39:40] but that don't make it what that ain't
[39:42] the thing that you're responsible for."
[39:46] As I've said, what if I was a young man
[39:48] and I was looking for a wife to be
[39:50] married. And here stood a girl that met
[39:53] every qualification. And I thought it
[39:55] took to make a woman. Why? Morally, she
[39:58] was a queen and lovely and a fine
[40:00] personality and a real Christian.
[40:03] everything that I could think of to make
[40:04] me a good wife. No matter how much I say
[40:07] she's perfect and she's exactly right,
[40:10] she isn't mine until I accept her and
[40:13] the responsibility of her being my wife.
[40:16] Amen. And that's the same thing he says
[40:19] that the message is you might say it's
[40:22] right or this or that or the other and
[40:24] say I sympathize with it. I believe it's
[40:27] the truth. But you've got to accept it
[40:30] and it's got to become a part of you and
[40:33] you a part of it. Then it's yours. Amen.
[40:37] Then it's yours. When you marry this
[40:40] certain woman that you have chosen, you
[40:42] are one then. Amen. When you marry her,
[40:45] you're one then. And that's the way you
[40:47] are with Christ. He says, when you see
[40:50] him manifested and made real, then you
[40:53] are a part of him. and he is a part of
[40:58] you and together you're part of the
[41:01] message. Amen. When Moses looked upon
[41:04] that pillar of fire that could have been
[41:07] he his entire experience was just
[41:09] looking upon it. I see that that's
[41:11] different. I see that that's wonderful.
[41:14] I love that. But he had to take off his
[41:16] shoes and he had to walk on the on the
[41:19] presence of that holy ground and and
[41:21] watch the watch the Lord change his life
[41:23] and fulfill the commission. And I
[41:25] believe every one of us has a has a
[41:27] commission and a purpose just like Moses
[41:30] did to to fulfill in our lives. Amen.
[41:33] Whatever that purpose is, I want to
[41:35] fulfill that purpose. Amen. I don't want
[41:37] to sympathize with the word. I don't
[41:39] want to read about it. I don't want to
[41:41] just say I believe it. I want it to
[41:43] become part of me. Amen. You become part
[41:46] of the word and then the word becomes
[41:48] part of you. Hallelujah.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; That's what I want in my life. Amen. to
[41:53] be the div uh to take part in the divine
[41:56] nature. Amen. When that nature lives and
[41:59] rules in your body, amen. Then it lives
[42:02] and rules through you. Amen. And you
[42:04] begin to express that thing, you begin
[42:07] to express his nature through your
[42:09] actions, through your character. I know
[42:12] we have faults and I know we have
[42:13] mistakes, but the purpose of the word is
[42:16] to continually change us. Amen. To grow
[42:20] us. Amen. To mold us. Amen. The closer
[42:23] you are to the presence of the Lord, the
[42:25] the less you see everything else and the
[42:29] more you can identify with what that is.
[42:31] I identify that that's different. I
[42:34] identify that there's something that I
[42:36] want about that. And I don't want this
[42:38] anymore. I don't want my flesh, man. I
[42:40] don't want what I used to be. I want
[42:42] what that is. I want whatever that
[42:44] presence is. Whatever that It's not just
[42:46] a feeling because it's more than a
[42:48] feeling. Amen. People have feelings all
[42:50] the time. It's more than that. It's a
[42:52] it's a it's an identification with
[42:55] something divine in your life. Amen.
[42:58] It's the power of God that was upon that
[43:00] mountain now living and reigning and
[43:04] ruling in your body. Amen. It's it's him
[43:06] expressing himself, the word through
[43:09] your life. Amen.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; You become part of that. And that's what
[43:15] the message is. It's the same message
[43:18] today. You become part of that. Amen.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; And I just oh it was burning on my heart
[43:25] when when I was reading about that, you
[43:26] know, because it was brother Brandham
[43:28] and he took that sword and it was upon
[43:30] the mountain of God that that happened
[43:32] and his commission changed. Amen. Oh,
[43:35] and he brought the word to us. And it
[43:38] was that same pillar of fire. It's the
[43:40] same pillar of fire. If you track it all
[43:43] through the scripture, if you track it
[43:45] through history, it's the same pillar of
[43:48] fire that now lives and rules and reigns
[43:51] in you. Amen.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; The Israelites, and I had made this
[44:02] point, the Israelites, they walked so
[44:04] close to that pillar of fire. They
[44:06] watched how we were just talking about,
[44:07] my wife and I, we how they they watched
[44:10] the supernatural. They watched the Red
[44:12] Sea split open. And I just read the
[44:14] other night, they they watched how it
[44:15] was the cloud or the fire, how how it
[44:18] distracted the Israel or the the
[44:20] Egyptian army when it was trying to
[44:21] cross her. It's they watch this
[44:23] supernatural thing take place. They
[44:25] watch the mana drop day by day. Amen.
[44:28] The coriander seed and and how it was
[44:30] just so it was so incredible. And Moses
[44:33] even would say that it's such fresh mana
[44:35] and such fresh dew that you it'll spoil
[44:38] if you leave it out. You have to eat it
[44:40] that day. Amen. Or otherwise it'll
[44:42] spoil. And there's a point in that
[44:44] because the the word is something like
[44:46] he like Paul said is he was a believer.
[44:49] He was baptized by the Holy Ghost. But
[44:51] he had to come and die daily because
[44:53] there's a fresh mana that takes place in
[44:56] our life every day where we're
[44:58] confronted. And that's the burden of my
[44:59] heart. where we're confronted with
[45:01] things in our life after you're born
[45:03] again of the spirit of God where you're
[45:05] where you're close to that fire and it
[45:07] starts to burn away the areas in your
[45:09] life. It starts to burn away things that
[45:12] they that that hinder you. It starts to
[45:14] show the pride that's been creeping in
[45:16] your mind. It starts to to to it starts
[45:19] to show that these thoughts aren't God's
[45:21] thoughts. Amen.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; But they would watch how it became
[45:28] common for them. Amen.
[45:32] And when we come into Christ and and you
[45:34] see him manifested and made real in your
[45:36] life, he becomes part of you. Amen. And
[45:40] it's more than it's more than just tapes
[45:43] that you hear that that were 70 years
[45:45] ago. Oh, I love those. But it's more
[45:47] than that because that was the moving of
[45:50] the pillar of fire in that day. Amen. In
[45:53] in our day, but 70 years ago, he's
[45:56] moving today. Amen. In the same way he's
[45:59] moving today. Hallelujah.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's that same pillar of
[46:05] fire.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Just some highlights here. U I brought
[46:08] out how the Israelites there in Exodus
[46:11] and it was the ones who stayed close to
[46:14] that fire. Amen. Close to that presence
[46:16] because those that were in that
[46:17] uttermost part of the camp, they were
[46:20] grumbling and they were complaining.
[46:22] Amen. those that were furthest away from
[46:24] that presence, they were they were uh it
[46:26] says that they they were just
[46:28] complaining and they were burned. Amen.
[46:30] The goal and I the point I was making
[46:32] was the goal was stay to stay close to
[46:34] that fire and and you know some comments
[46:36] I wanted to to make along with that you
[46:38] know it's the closer that we are to the
[46:43] presence of the Lord in in the daily
[46:46] tasks of our life in daily everyday
[46:50] activities in your thought process in
[46:52] what we listen in the small things in
[46:55] that it's it's the more that you
[46:58] resemble the word the more you resemble
[47:00] him. Amen. The closer you are to that.
[47:03] And that's why the Bible would say that
[47:05] all things are, you know, all things are
[47:08] lawful, but they're not all expedient.
[47:10] Because an expediency speaks of
[47:12] something that's get you get you further
[47:14] down the road or closer to something.
[47:16] And it's not expedient for you to do a
[47:18] certain thing if it's taking you away
[47:21] from where you need to be. Amen. if
[47:24] there would have been a distraction
[47:25] around when Moses saw that pillar of
[47:27] fire or if there would have been
[47:29] something else taking place and he would
[47:31] have gotten distracted. But no, he had
[47:32] to stay focused and and keep moving into
[47:34] that. Amen. And the same thing in your
[47:36] daily life, in your daily tasks and
[47:39] that's real simple, but you just have to
[47:41] you have to stay in continual
[47:42] fellowship. You know, in in fellowship
[47:44] with with anybody, it's about rel
[47:47] relationship is about fellowship. Amen.
[47:49] You you the closer you get to someone,
[47:51] the more you want to be around them.
[47:52] Amen. the more the more you want to know
[47:54] about them and and the more you
[47:56] understand when you're with my wife and
[47:57] the more you you start to understand
[47:59] them and the more they start to
[48:01] understand you. And it's the same thing
[48:02] with Christ. Amen. The closer you get to
[48:05] the Lord, the more you start to
[48:06] understand the more you start to to to
[48:09] to see how he wants me to be and oh and
[48:12] and I want to just I want to live in
[48:13] that place. Amen.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:18] The more the more you stay close to that
[48:20] presence, the more you start to resemble
[48:23] the word
[48:24] &gt;&gt; through through contact. Amen.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Through through contact.
[48:31] I had brought up I wanted to
[48:34] I got a little bit fast last time, so I
[48:36] wanted to slow some of these points
[48:38] down.
[48:39] I brought up the caterpillar last
[48:41] service and how that when it gets ready
[48:43] to make its transition, amen, into a
[48:45] butterfly, it starts to feed. But in
[48:47] order for it to gain the the proper
[48:49] nutrients for its body change, it's got
[48:51] to feed on the right plant, right? Amen.
[48:53] And its whole life is preparation for
[48:56] this change. From the moment that it's
[48:57] born uh as a caterpillar, it grows. It
[49:00] finds the right atmosphere. It struggles
[49:01] along, and then it finds the right kind
[49:04] of leaf. Usually, they're supposed to be
[49:06] born on the leaf that they need to be.
[49:08] They they're supposed to be born on
[49:09] that, but sometimes they have to
[49:10] struggle along and try to find their
[49:12] way. Amen. And and then they're given
[49:14] the right kind of nutrition and then it
[49:16] keeps eating and eating because
[49:18] eventually it's going to eat its way to
[49:20] a body change. Amen. It just needs the
[49:23] right conditions. It needs the right
[49:25] food and it needs the right atmosphere.
[49:27] Amen. And just uh some a point here. I
[49:30] was I was looking at caterpillars. They
[49:32] grow these things. These discs, these
[49:34] imagininal discs is what they're called.
[49:36] And there parts of its body that they
[49:37] basically they lay dormant until they
[49:41] until they become a caterpillar. Amen.
[49:44] So what it is, it's it's parts of their
[49:46] body, maybe their wings or their feet or
[49:48] their legs or their eyes that they're
[49:50] that they're definitely going to need
[49:52] when they're mature into a butterfly.
[49:54] Amen. And in some types of caterpillars,
[49:57] those discs that that that they won't
[50:00] use until it's mature, they can actually
[50:02] begin to take shape or form. Amen. Catch
[50:06] this. Take shape or form before it
[50:09] changes into a butterfly. Amen. Before
[50:13] the caterpillar takes that change and
[50:14] before it forms a cocoon. Amen. You
[50:17] know, and I wanted to to stop on that
[50:19] because sometimes we we as believers, we
[50:21] we push things off. You know, we're
[50:22] we're going to be we're going to be
[50:24] perfect over there. We're going to be
[50:25] once we have our body changed, once we
[50:27] take the once we go in the rapture. But
[50:29] the Bible says that we are to be
[50:31] partakers of his divine nature now.
[50:34] Amen. I want we're supposed to live
[50:36] close so close to the Lord like Enoch
[50:38] lived. That one day you're just walking
[50:40] with him and you just continue to walk
[50:42] up. Amen. That's the place you want to
[50:44] live. That's the place you want to be.
[50:46] Those discs in your life spiritually
[50:48] speaking, you know, they're going to
[50:50] start to manifest in your life. Amen.
[50:52] The nature of Christ should manifest in
[50:55] your life through your actions, through
[50:57] your reactions, through your daily
[50:59] living, in every avenue, those things
[51:02] should start to grow. Amen. Hallelujah.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; I had read this quote last time, but my
[51:11] it struck me. The bride church will
[51:13] mature and her rightness shall be an
[51:16] identification with her Lord by means of
[51:18] the word.
[51:20] Then as she nears her headstone a little
[51:22] bit further down, becoming like him
[51:24] through the word,
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus will come that the bride and groom
[51:28] may be forever united as one. Amen.
[51:32] Becoming like him through the word. What
[51:36] does that mean? It means that you're
[51:37] eating on the right thing. Amen. It
[51:39] means that you're feeding in the right
[51:41] atmosphere. Amen. It means that you've
[51:43] got the right plan. Amen. It's giving
[51:45] you the right nutrients. Amen. You're
[51:47] feeding on the word. Amen. You're not so
[51:49] distracted with everything around you
[51:51] because there's one sole purpose in your
[51:53] life and it's to meet that change
[51:55] because there's a change coming and you
[51:58] want to be a part of that change.
[51:59] Otherwise, you're going to be crawling
[52:01] around the rest of your life. Amen. Oh,
[52:03] it doesn't even know what it has until
[52:05] it starts to fly. Oh, but I bet when
[52:08] that be when that cat butterfly starts
[52:10] to fly, it doesn't ever wish that it was
[52:12] crawling on the ground again. Amen. And
[52:14] that's I know what it's going to be for
[52:16] us. Oh, amen. Once we hit that change,
[52:19] we're never even going to think about
[52:20] this life anymore. We're not going to
[52:22] think about all the trials. We're not
[52:24] going to think about the mind battles.
[52:26] We're not going to think about the
[52:27] immature things that we that we did or
[52:29] that we said. We're going to be living
[52:31] in that place. Amen. We're going to be
[52:32] flying high.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; It's those characteristics of Christ
[52:40] manifesting in our daily life. Amen.
[52:44] Amen. We we start to see our lives
[52:47] becoming like him through the word. The
[52:49] prophet says,
[52:52] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. He says this in in souls
[52:54] that are in prison now 1963. He says
[52:57] that's why we are baptized into his name
[53:00] that we might come forth in his name, in
[53:03] his death, in his resurrection, that we
[53:05] rise again, testifying to the world that
[53:08] we have new life and the old man is
[53:10] dead. Amen.
[53:13] that the old man is dead. We buried that
[53:17] first nature. See, the first nature is
[53:20] gone. And now we are the nature of him.
[53:24] Amen.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; He lives in us. And we don't do our own
[53:28] will. We do his will. We don't think our
[53:31] own thoughts. The mind, the mind is what
[53:34] thinks. The mind that was in Christ
[53:36] Jesus is in every believer. See, there
[53:39] is the soul. And that's what we're
[53:42] speaking of. That's the part I'm
[53:43] thinking of now within us, the soul.
[53:46] When we begin to think his thoughts, you
[53:49] you start to just hone in on what needs
[53:52] changed in your life. Amen. The higher
[53:55] you get upon that mountain, the farther
[53:58] away from the rest of the world you get,
[54:00] saints of God, the point of climbing
[54:02] higher in those atmospheres is because
[54:05] as you take one step, Amen. You're still
[54:07] able to view the ground and you're able
[54:09] to view all these things and there may
[54:11] be distractions, but as you continue to
[54:14] progress in your walk, as you continue
[54:16] to progress in your maturity, you get a
[54:18] little bit higher and you don't see
[54:20] these things as much and you don't focus
[54:22] on those things as much. And then you
[54:24] get a little bit higher. And the higher
[54:25] you get, the closer you can get to the
[54:27] Lord. And the further away the
[54:29] distractions become, the further away
[54:31] the the where you used to view these
[54:34] people and and these things and these
[54:35] situations. is now you're a little bit
[54:37] higher. So those things get out of view.
[54:40] Amen. They're not even in view anymore.
[54:43] I don't want those things to even be in
[54:45] view. Amen. I want to be high upon that
[54:47] mountain. Hallelujah. I want that divine
[54:50] nature. I want those divine
[54:52] characteristics of Christ to rule and
[54:54] reign in my life. I know I'm not there
[54:56] yet, but by the grace of God, I believe
[54:59] I'll get there. Amen. And I want to get
[55:01] a little bit furthered right now today.
[55:04] I want to die out to to to myself and to
[55:07] Christ right now so that I can attain
[55:09] just even a little bit a little bit of
[55:11] hair closer to that walk. Amen.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:21] Wanted to go through a couple of
[55:25] couple of scriptures here tonight and
[55:28] just notice some of the language that
[55:29] was used here. There in second Peter
[55:32] 1:es
[55:33] 3-4 it says according as his divine
[55:37] power hath given unto us all things
[55:41] &gt;&gt; that pertain unto life and godliness
[55:45] &gt;&gt; through the knowledge of him that hath
[55:48] called us to glory and virtue.
[55:51] He called us to glory and virtue and the
[55:55] work that he started in you he is able
[55:58] to accomplish and finish. Amen. whereby
[56:01] are given unto us exceeding great and
[56:05] precious promises, that by these ye
[56:08] might be partakers of the divine nature,
[56:13] having escaped the corruption that is in
[56:16] the world through lust. Thank you, Lord,
[56:19] for that. Oh, I want to escape the world
[56:21] and the corruption of the world. Amen. I
[56:24] want to be a partaker of that divine
[56:27] nature. Amen. It's it's more than just a
[56:30] passive process. Amen, saints. It's more
[56:32] than you just going to church and and
[56:35] hearing the word and sympathizing with
[56:38] this thing. Amen. It's you taking a hold
[56:41] of that divine nature. Because I want to
[56:43] tell you, if you got a call, if you got
[56:45] a if you got a desire in your heart,
[56:47] it's because God put that desire in your
[56:49] heart. Amen. And you hold on to that
[56:51] rope and you keep going and you keep
[56:54] tugging. And the more you tug, the more
[56:56] the Lord will will will pour out his
[56:58] divine nature into you. Amen. Amen.
[57:01] We're not immediately matured uh seeds.
[57:03] Amen. Sometimes it takes through a
[57:05] process of maturing and growing. Amen.
[57:08] Hallelujah.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Romans says it like this. Put ye on the
[57:17] Lord Jesus Christ. for he says in
[57:20] Galatians 3 it says for ye are all
[57:22] children of God by faith in Christ Jesus
[57:25] for as many of you have been baptized
[57:26] into Christ have put on Christ
[57:32] &gt;&gt; he says in this Colossians 3 put on
[57:35] therefore as the elect of God put on
[57:37] notice the language as the elect of God
[57:39] holy and beloved bowels of mercies and
[57:43] kindness humbleness of mind meekness and
[57:47] longsuffering forbearing one another,
[57:49] forgiving one another, forbearing one
[57:52] another, forgiving one another.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; And if you have any quarrel against any,
[57:56] even as Christ forgave you, so also do
[57:59] ye. And above all these things, put on
[58:02] charity. Put on charity, which is the
[58:06] bond of perfectness. And let the peace
[58:08] of God rule in your hearts. To that to
[58:11] the which also ye are called in one
[58:13] body, and ye thankful. Amen.
[58:16] uh mercies and kindness. These are the
[58:19] characteristics of the Lord that he
[58:21] wants you to obtain. Amen. By you
[58:23] putting on the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[58:26] Longsuffering. Amen. Forgiving one
[58:28] another. Hallelujah. Forbearing one
[58:30] another. You know, and he's speaking to
[58:32] believers.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; He's speaking to to put these things on
[58:36] like a garment. You It's an active
[58:38] thing. You you let the nature of the
[58:41] Lord you put on the mind of Christ to
[58:43] let him think the thoughts in you and
[58:45] through you. Amen. You you let him do
[58:48] these things through you. In my nature,
[58:50] I know many times I couldn't come to a
[58:52] situation a and maybe forgive somebody
[58:55] for something. But I know that the Lord
[58:57] can do that in me and through me. Amen.
[58:59] I I know that in my own self I could
[59:01] come and I wouldn't have the meekness
[59:03] that I would need. I wouldn't have the
[59:05] longsuffering that I would need. But I
[59:07] know that through Christ, he makes all
[59:09] things possible. Amen.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; When he does it in your life. Amen.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; I wanted to to speak um just for a
[59:19] moment on this on this m this maturing.
[59:22] Amen. The the the maturing of us
[59:26] becoming more like Christ through the
[59:28] word like brotherham says. And he uses
[59:30] that word
[59:32] he uses that word ripeness. Amen. and
[59:34] ripeness. It speaks of readiness for
[59:36] that seed to come to life. Amen. And and
[59:39] you know because whatever's in
[59:41] whatever's in the seed and for whenever
[59:45] it comes time for it to mature and
[59:47] blossom, amen, there's a time, amen,
[59:49] where in the process of maturing, you
[59:52] know, just in the natural order of of of
[59:54] botany life, death has to to take place.
[59:57] Amen. In order for new life to grow,
[59:59] seeds, they have to lay in the ground.
[1:00:02] They have to die in order to germinate
[1:00:04] and to grow. Amen. But as the seed grows
[1:00:08] and the life of whatever is in that se
[1:00:11] seed starts to come to maturity, so see
[1:00:15] just in natural view this morning, you
[1:00:17] plant a seed and and it dies and and
[1:00:20] then when it comes time for life, Amen.
[1:00:22] it starts to to bear roots. Amen. You
[1:00:24] don't see the roots. You don't see that
[1:00:26] because it's under the surface, but it
[1:00:28] bears roots. And then as it starts to
[1:00:31] come up, amen, you start to see what
[1:00:33] what was in that seed. Amen. Amen. And
[1:00:36] and just thinking spiritually this
[1:00:38] morning and trying to trying to move to
[1:00:40] something here. Even even seeds that are
[1:00:44] producing what it was intended to
[1:00:46] produce, many times as it's coming to
[1:00:50] its its ripeness or its maturity, you
[1:00:52] start to get a view of what it's going
[1:00:55] to look like. Amen.
[1:00:56] Amen.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; You start to see that that little bud
[1:00:59] come out of the ground. If it's a tree,
[1:01:01] you know, when it's just a small tree,
[1:01:03] you can start to identify what that tree
[1:01:06] is. You start to see maybe a little bit
[1:01:08] of leaf here or maybe maybe it's growing
[1:01:10] a branch there. You start to see what is
[1:01:13] the identification of what that was in
[1:01:16] the ground. Amen. It's already taken
[1:01:18] root. It's already started to grow. And
[1:01:20] as it just matures, even just a little
[1:01:22] bit, you can start to see what it's
[1:01:23] going to look like. Amen.
[1:01:27] You you might even begin to see what
[1:01:29] form it'll take and and and what shape
[1:01:32] it will have when it's fully grown.
[1:01:34] Amen.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; You start to to to visualize
[1:01:41] the life of that seed coming to its
[1:01:43] fruition.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; And you know, speaking spiritually, I
[1:01:47] believe that's what brother Brandham was
[1:01:49] saying that how it's supposed to be in
[1:01:51] the life of our of the believer tonight.
[1:01:54] The seeds been planted in our life.
[1:01:56] Amen.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The seed's been planted in our
[1:01:59] life. We've been watering it with the
[1:02:01] word. We've been We've been giving it
[1:02:02] the right nutrition. It's been in the
[1:02:04] presence of the SO.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; And even though we're not in that fully
[1:02:09] matured state yet. Amen. Even though we
[1:02:13] haven't undergone our metamorphosis yet,
[1:02:17] I believe we can start to resemble what
[1:02:20] the Lord has in view for our future.
[1:02:23] Amen.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that we're supposed to
[1:02:27] start to have envision a vision of what
[1:02:30] we're supposed to look like. Amen. We're
[1:02:32] supposed to be partakers of that divine
[1:02:34] nature. Amen. We're we're supposed to
[1:02:36] maybe maybe grow a little bit here. And
[1:02:39] and there's a pruning process, you know,
[1:02:41] in certain kinds of plants. And you
[1:02:42] know, as you get to a place, you might
[1:02:44] need to prune it in in order for a
[1:02:46] certain amount of of sunlight to come in
[1:02:48] or a certain amount of nutrients to come
[1:02:50] in. But as you begin to do that, it
[1:02:52] begins to grow and you begin to see what
[1:02:54] it is. And that is the life of a
[1:02:56] believer. Amen. That's what I want for
[1:02:58] my life. I want to be able to put on
[1:03:00] Christ and I want to be able to let him
[1:03:03] uh express himself through my life.
[1:03:06] Amen.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; To resemble what the Lord
[1:03:12] has in view for our future. Amen.
[1:03:18] I want to try to just bring out this
[1:03:19] point
[1:03:21] here tonight.
[1:03:24] Turn maybe turn a little corner. Um
[1:03:30] my real burden for tonight
[1:03:34] was that scripture where it said that
[1:03:37] you because as believers just to expound
[1:03:40] on that for a moment as believers you we
[1:03:43] have to realize that there's not just
[1:03:44] one death you die. There is there is a
[1:03:47] death you die. Amen. And that's when the
[1:03:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost takes root in
[1:03:52] your soul. Amen. But Paul says there's a
[1:03:55] dying daily. Amen.
[1:04:00] And the amplified says that I face, he
[1:04:03] says it like this, that same scripture,
[1:04:05] I face death every day and I die to
[1:04:10] self. Amen.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; I face death every day and I die to
[1:04:17] self. Amen. Because there's a continual
[1:04:20] burning away of yourself and your
[1:04:24] desires and your flesh, man. Amen. All
[1:04:27] the things that this guy messes up,
[1:04:30] there should be a continual burning
[1:04:33] away. Amen. Maybe my temper got a little
[1:04:35] offkilter. There should be a continual
[1:04:38] burning away of two fingers pointed back
[1:04:41] at me. Amen. And maybe maybe I did
[1:04:43] something wrong. Maybe I said something
[1:04:44] wrong. There should be a continual
[1:04:47] growth. Amen. Where I die daily. I die
[1:04:51] every single time I'm confronted with a
[1:04:55] mistake that I've made. I die every time
[1:04:58] that I'm confronted with something in my
[1:05:01] life that isn't lining up with the word.
[1:05:03] Amen. That is a monumental thing to
[1:05:05] tonight because sometimes the Lord
[1:05:07] confronts you with things. Amen. And
[1:05:09] he's wanting you to face up to that and
[1:05:12] he wants you to die out to it. Amen. He
[1:05:14] wants to separate you from it. Amen. He
[1:05:16] wants you to grow into a higher place.
[1:05:18] Amen.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Pride or like I was saying, immature
[1:05:25] things. And and you know, we all come
[1:05:27] into face we we come into contact with
[1:05:29] it face to face with ourselves every
[1:05:31] day. Amen.
[1:05:34] You know, and this is just
[1:05:39] this is just probably a short shorter
[1:05:41] sermon tonight, but in just the last
[1:05:43] like 10 10 12 minutes here, I was going
[1:05:46] through the life of of some individuals
[1:05:49] in in history. And Matt had actually he
[1:05:53] had preached on this guy, I don't know,
[1:05:55] a couple years ago, and and uh it was
[1:05:57] speaking about a man by the name of of
[1:05:59] Dietrich Bonhaofer. I'm sure the name is
[1:06:01] probably familiar with many people. And
[1:06:03] he was actually a pastor in Germany
[1:06:06] during the Nazi reign. Amen. And just
[1:06:09] some things that I found amazing was
[1:06:11] that during the first few months of
[1:06:14] Hitler's ascension into power, Dietrich
[1:06:17] actually he had went on national radio
[1:06:20] and he started to publicly stand against
[1:06:23] the Nazi regime and and he talked about
[1:06:26] how it was mocking God and and and he
[1:06:28] said all these things and and stood
[1:06:30] against the rising enemy. And the
[1:06:32] broadcast was actually cut off before it
[1:06:35] it even finished. and and he was he was
[1:06:38] able to evade certain issues for a while
[1:06:42] because it was his brother or his
[1:06:43] brother-in-law. Several of his brothers
[1:06:45] were in in the Nazi regime at in some
[1:06:49] form or fashion and I think it was his
[1:06:50] brother-in-law that was kind of higher
[1:06:52] ranking in there and he had some rank to
[1:06:54] him and so he was able to get him into
[1:06:56] some kind of a position like a staff
[1:06:58] position working in his office. Amen.
[1:07:01] safe um safe for a while and and then
[1:07:06] something took place and he was actually
[1:07:09] able to escape Germany and something
[1:07:12] that was so notable to me was that he
[1:07:15] escaped Germany came to the United
[1:07:18] States and the moment that he got to the
[1:07:20] United States he landed and he said I
[1:07:23] must live through this difficult period
[1:07:26] in our national history with the people
[1:07:29] of Germany and I must return to my post
[1:07:34] by the big ship. Amen. He was away from
[1:07:38] the enemy. He was away from it. But he
[1:07:41] had such a burning in his heart to be to
[1:07:44] stand against what they were doing that
[1:07:46] he went back and and it was almost
[1:07:48] immediately I think that that he was
[1:07:50] captured just some of the timeline and
[1:07:53] not sure about but he was sent to this
[1:07:55] extermination camp
[1:07:58] and and this is actually where this
[1:08:00] sermon came from tonight. A well-known
[1:08:04] doctor was in the camp with him at the
[1:08:07] time. Amen. and and he began to watch
[1:08:10] him. And this was I mean they were only
[1:08:13] a month I think it was a month from
[1:08:15] getting uh from them uh from Germany
[1:08:19] losing and and and and giving up. Amen.
[1:08:22] And he was in this extermination camp
[1:08:25] and his day came to be taken to the
[1:08:29] gallows and to be hang. And this
[1:08:30] well-known doctor that was in the same
[1:08:33] camp with him, he watched as Dietrich
[1:08:37] came to some of his last moments in
[1:08:39] life. And he said, this was the
[1:08:41] testimony of the doctor watching
[1:08:44] Dietrich in his last final moments. He
[1:08:46] said, "Through the halfway open door in
[1:08:50] one room of the huts, I saw Pastor
[1:08:54] Bonhoffer
[1:08:56] before taking off his prison garb
[1:08:59] kneeling on the floor fervently praying
[1:09:02] to his God. I was so deeply moved by the
[1:09:07] way this lovable man prayed, so devout
[1:09:11] and so certain that the Lord heard his
[1:09:14] prayer.
[1:09:16] At the place of execution, he again said
[1:09:20] a prayer and then climbed the steps to
[1:09:24] the gallows.
[1:09:26] Brave and composed, his death ensued in
[1:09:31] a few seconds. And he said this, catch
[1:09:34] this now. He said, "In the almost 50
[1:09:37] years of being a doctor, I've hardly
[1:09:40] ever seen a man die so entirely
[1:09:45] submissive to the will of God."
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; In the 50 years of watching people die,
[1:09:53] I've never seen someone die so entirely
[1:09:57] submissive to the will of God. My heart
[1:10:00] got so inspired in that because when it
[1:10:02] comes time for my end to draw nigh, I
[1:10:05] hope that can be my testimony. Amen. I
[1:10:08] want to have a testimony like that man's
[1:10:10] where I could come to a place where I've
[1:10:13] been so entirely submissive to the will
[1:10:17] of God. Amen. But even further than that
[1:10:20] this evening, because this is really
[1:10:21] where my burden is, is that we're
[1:10:23] supposed to come to that juncture every
[1:10:25] day of our lives. We're supposed to come
[1:10:28] to that place where we're up on the
[1:10:30] gallows and the one that's going to hang
[1:10:32] us is our self because it's this flesh
[1:10:35] man that fights me. Amen. But I want to
[1:10:38] be so entirely submissive to the will of
[1:10:41] God to be able to say, "Lord, forgive
[1:10:43] me. Lord, help me to grow in these areas
[1:10:47] that I need growing. Help me to be a div
[1:10:49] partaker of your divine nature." Amen.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:56] God is He's bringing his sons and his
[1:10:58] daughters. He's bringing you tonight
[1:11:00] into the maturity that you need. Amen.
[1:11:03] He's ripening the seed. He's providing
[1:11:05] the sun. He's giving you the water.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Are you going to have the attitude like
[1:11:09] Pastor Bonhaer had? Amen. There is going
[1:11:12] to come a time in your natural life
[1:11:14] where we're going to die. Maybe it will
[1:11:16] be means of the grave. I hope not. I
[1:11:18] hope it'll be means of the rapture.
[1:11:19] Amen. But right now, today, can you say
[1:11:22] with your whole heart that I've come
[1:11:25] entirely submissive to the will of God
[1:11:28] for my life?
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Can you honestly say that this this
[1:11:32] evening?
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:37] Most often times it's our own flesh.
[1:11:40] It's our own failures. Amen. I want to
[1:11:43] come with such dedication and such
[1:11:46] reverence, you know, and I thought that
[1:11:48] was amazing because he was a miles and
[1:11:52] miles from the enemy,
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; but he went back and he stood there and
[1:11:58] he was one of the ones that died. There
[1:12:00] were so many men that that that ended up
[1:12:02] surviving and there were so many that
[1:12:04] died and he was one of those. Amen.
[1:12:07] And just tonight, amen. I want to be
[1:12:09] able to face the battle the enemy the
[1:12:12] the enemy is fighting in your mind.
[1:12:14] That's the place, the battleground.
[1:12:16] Amen. But I want to be able to face the
[1:12:18] battle with the word. And when you go
[1:12:21] and you go to battle, you've got to come
[1:12:23] with the right amount of with the right
[1:12:25] amount of of tools, the right tools in
[1:12:28] your toolbox. You got to come with the
[1:12:29] right weapon. You've got to fight with
[1:12:31] the sword. You've got to yield it in
[1:12:33] your life. You got to recognize, listen
[1:12:35] saints, you got to recognize that most
[1:12:37] oftent times the thing that that sword
[1:12:40] is going to yield to is things in your
[1:12:42] own life. It's going to be you pruning
[1:12:45] things off of yourself. You're going to
[1:12:47] be growing and growing and you're going
[1:12:48] to realize and recognize that an area
[1:12:51] needs to grow out. So, you need to prune
[1:12:53] that thing off in order for the sun to
[1:12:56] shine on that area. Amen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:01] every fault in my life. Amen.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Even in in those small areas,
[1:13:13] how do we respond? I had said that
[1:13:16] Sunday. How do how you respond to the
[1:13:19] word? Two places. As brother Bham says
[1:13:21] in just some closing thoughts, he says,
[1:13:24] "It's the little things that you leave
[1:13:26] undone,
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; not the big things that you're trying to
[1:13:29] do." Oh my.
[1:13:32] In another place, he says, "Do you
[1:13:34] understand that it's the little things
[1:13:35] that you pass over and omit that mean so
[1:13:39] much to God?"
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Can you can the church conceive that
[1:13:43] this morning in our achievement, in our
[1:13:44] organizations, in our great buildings,
[1:13:46] masterpieces? We're omitting the little
[1:13:48] things that mean so much to God and so
[1:13:51] much to our eternal destination. We omit
[1:13:55] those things. Bible says, "Despise not
[1:13:57] the day of of of of small things." Amen.
[1:14:01] That was the the burning on my heart.
[1:14:03] When confronted with those things of
[1:14:05] pride, Amen. When confronted with those
[1:14:08] things of immaturity, when confronted
[1:14:10] with these things, will you use it as an
[1:14:13] opportunity of growth? Amen. Will you
[1:14:16] use it as a time where you say, "Lord, I
[1:14:18] humble myself in your presence." Amen.
[1:14:22] Will you will you be so entirely to the
[1:14:25] to this uh entirely submissive to the
[1:14:28] will of God?
[1:14:30] Amen.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; There's a death, he says, that takes
[1:14:35] place every day
[1:14:38] when we recognize that God is trying to
[1:14:41] mature us in the word. Amen.
[1:14:48] those I had made this point. It pruning
[1:14:51] enhances I just just did a little search
[1:14:53] on this. It enhances the plant's ability
[1:14:55] to obtain light and air. It enhances
[1:14:58] growth and that has to happen in order
[1:15:02] for that thing to come to its full
[1:15:04] maturity and express what was always in
[1:15:07] that seed. Amen.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; I just want I just want the Lord to do
[1:15:11] that in my life. Are you with me? stand
[1:15:13] with me tonight or this little simple
[1:15:15] thought tonight. But that's what I want
[1:15:17] the Lord to do in my life. Amen. I want
[1:15:20] to be when we're confronted with even
[1:15:23] the small things. Amen. That so often
[1:15:26] times we omit and so often things we
[1:15:30] look over. When we're confronted with
[1:15:32] that area that we're able to grow into a
[1:15:36] a higher place of the Lord. Amen.
[1:15:39] so entirely
[1:15:41] submissive.
[1:15:47] He came up to those gallows. Just close
[1:15:49] your eyes with me just for a moment. And
[1:15:51] you know, he came up to
[1:15:54] to those gallows and
[1:15:58] you know, and it's in those times that a
[1:16:01] lot of times it's in it's in those
[1:16:03] moments where people just express what's
[1:16:06] really in them. and and he started to
[1:16:08] express just the the nature I would say
[1:16:11] that that would that was the divine
[1:16:13] nature of the Lord. I was reading this
[1:16:15] story I don't know if I have it here.
[1:16:17] Let's see if I have it here. I was
[1:16:19] reading this story of of some of the
[1:16:21] martyrs there
[1:16:24] and uh
[1:16:26] one of them was named Perpeta and she
[1:16:29] was this young Christian noble woman
[1:16:31] woman. The authorities, it was around
[1:16:33] the year 200. The authorities, they were
[1:16:35] demanding that everyone show their
[1:16:37] loyalty by offering a sacrifice to the
[1:16:40] divine spirit of the Roman Empire. And
[1:16:42] devout Christians refused to do this.
[1:16:45] Jesus was their only Lord. Though she
[1:16:47] had recently given birth, Perpeta
[1:16:49] refused to sacrifice and she was
[1:16:51] arrested. Her father visited her in
[1:16:54] prison and begged her to recant. Didn't
[1:16:57] she realize that Christians were being
[1:16:59] hauled off to the city? he said to into
[1:17:02] the arena to face these wild animals or
[1:17:04] gladiators in front of bloodthirsty
[1:17:06] mobs. Wouldn't she consider her little
[1:17:09] baby or her aging papa or and save
[1:17:12] herself?
[1:17:14] She said, "I I can't." She says, she
[1:17:17] says, "Look at this vase," she told him,
[1:17:19] "or picture. Can it be called by any
[1:17:21] other name than what it is?" "No," he
[1:17:24] responded. then I can't say that I'm
[1:17:26] anything else other than what I am in a
[1:17:28] as a Christian and despite the pleas of
[1:17:31] her father and her brother she stood
[1:17:33] trial before the governor refused to
[1:17:36] perform the sacrifice and when asked
[1:17:39] point blank are you a Christian he she
[1:17:41] said I am she finton she was sentenced
[1:17:44] to face the beasts amen and it says that
[1:17:48] she was still accounts show that she was
[1:17:50] still in high spirits she understood
[1:17:53] that this was her calling willing to die
[1:17:55] for Christ. Her own diary, imprisonment,
[1:17:58] trial and preparation for martyrdom was
[1:18:01] widely distributed among the early
[1:18:03] Christians, inspiring many. Amen. One uh
[1:18:08] writer
[1:18:10] actually said that she stood strong to
[1:18:12] the end, even guiding the sword of a
[1:18:15] trembling gladiator to her throat. And I
[1:18:19] know that this is a different time.
[1:18:21] Amen. But I know that how the Lord just
[1:18:24] laid this upon my heart is is sometimes
[1:18:26] we're faced we're faced to to look at
[1:18:30] that pillar of fire. We're faced to to
[1:18:32] to a certain thing. Sometimes it's our
[1:18:36] self. I just want to come to whatever it
[1:18:39] is the Lord wants me to come to entirely
[1:18:42] submissive to his will. If that's your
[1:18:45] heart's desire this morning,
[1:18:49] just or this evening, just raise your
[1:18:51] hand up to the Lord.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Just want to die out to ourselves. There
[1:18:57] was a they had to physically die. We
[1:18:59] have to spiritually die in the age we're
[1:19:01] living in. Amen. Let's just bow our
[1:19:04] heads in our hearts. Heavenly Father, we
[1:19:06] just want to thank you for this day and
[1:19:07] for the service, Lord. Father, we love
[1:19:09] you, Lord Jesus. And we just commit
[1:19:11] every everything into your hands, Lord.
[1:19:13] We want to be partakers of your divine
[1:19:15] nature tonight, Lord. Lord, we want just
[1:19:18] those things to to come to to fruition
[1:19:21] in our in our lives, Lord God. We want
[1:19:23] to become more like you, Lord Jesus. I
[1:19:25] have a great desire to become less like
[1:19:28] me, Lord Jesus. I don't want any more of
[1:19:31] my thoughts. I want your thoughts, Lord.
[1:19:33] I don't want any more of of of Caleb. I
[1:19:36] want more of Jesus, Lord, just living
[1:19:38] and reigning and ruling in my life,
[1:19:40] Lord. I believe that's the desire of of
[1:19:43] many tonight, Lord Jesus. Father, may
[1:19:46] may you just see every heart, Lord God.
[1:19:49] See, Lord, you you only you know the
[1:19:51] heart, Lord God. Only knew you know how
[1:19:53] they can respond to it, Lord Jesus. But
[1:19:56] may you just see their hearts, Father.
[1:19:58] Lord, help each one tonight. Father, we
[1:20:00] love you. We just commit this whole
[1:20:01] service to you now, Lord. In the lovely
[1:20:04] name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[1:20:07] Whatever you're singing, bro, is good.
[1:20:11] My heart, oh God,
[1:20:14] [Music]
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; make it ever
[1:20:21] true.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Change my heart, oh God.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; May I be like you.
[1:20:38] You are the potter
[1:20:41] for You are the potter.
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:49] I am the clay.
[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:20:57] Mold me and make
[1:21:01] me. This is what This is what I pray.
[1:21:11] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:21:15] Why don't you raise your hands and sing
[1:21:17] that like a prayer? Make it ever
[1:21:22] true.
[1:21:27] Change my heart, oh God.
[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:21:34] May I be like
[1:21:37] you.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire? Lord, change
[1:21:44] my heart. Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank
[1:21:46] you, brother Caleb, for that. Do you
[1:21:48] appreciate the word of the Lord?
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we give the Lord a hand
[1:21:52] clap of prayer?
[1:21:53] [Applause]
[1:21:54] [Music]
[1:21:55] [Applause]
[1:21:57] Amen. Praise the Lord's friends. I truly
[1:21:59] hope it means something to you. I know
[1:22:01] it does to me. Amen. I was just
[1:22:03] appreciating what brother Caleb said.
[1:22:05] Amen. Especially there at the end. You
[1:22:08] know, I just wrote down in my own notes.
[1:22:10] Am I willing to die?
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; You know, that's a good question you
[1:22:13] could ask yourself because brother
[1:22:14] Brandham asked that question. If you
[1:22:17] really believe something, you're willing
[1:22:19] to lay your life down for what you
[1:22:21] believe. Now, it's amazing because
[1:22:24] and just just do inventory here for a
[1:22:27] second, friends. And honestly, sometimes
[1:22:29] we won't even come to church if it
[1:22:31] inconveniences us. But will we lay our
[1:22:33] life down for what we believe? Think
[1:22:36] about that just for a second. We we
[1:22:38] we're too tired. We got sniffles. Got a
[1:22:40] headache. I'll be honest. I'm I'll put
[1:22:42] myself right here with you. Sometimes I
[1:22:44] ask myself, am do I really have
[1:22:46] conviction or am I just sympathizing
[1:22:48] with something that I say that I
[1:22:50] believe? Can we be honest tonight? Amen.
[1:22:52] Because true conviction means you'd be
[1:22:54] willing to lay your life and give your
[1:22:56] life for what you believe. Let alone
[1:22:58] surrender your life to the Lord Jesus
[1:23:01] and let him take every single part of
[1:23:03] it. Amen. Dedric Bonhifer was willing to
[1:23:05] give his life. Brother Caleb. Amen.
[1:23:07] That's how much it meant to him. He
[1:23:08] brother Brandham talked about
[1:23:09] Christopher Columbus and he said he had
[1:23:11] a, you know, a church full of cowards
[1:23:13] and men who wanted to turn around and
[1:23:15] turn back and were threatening mutiny
[1:23:17] going to overthrow him and threatened
[1:23:19] his life, threatened to kill him. And
[1:23:21] they said, and I forget how that how it
[1:23:23] says it in history, but they said, 'What
[1:23:25] say you, thou sailor? You know what what
[1:23:27] what you say? And Christopher Columbus
[1:23:29] said, "Salom. Salom. Salom. Salomon."
[1:23:33] Brother Brandham said, "That's what we
[1:23:35] need tonight as men that in spite of the
[1:23:38] unbelief, in spite of the the
[1:23:40] circumstances," he said, "If the church
[1:23:42] ever needed to get past the barrier of
[1:23:45] their own unbelief, I say it's right
[1:23:47] now." Now I say, "Lord, let me get past
[1:23:49] the barrier of my own unbelief." If you
[1:23:52] don't believe it, don't raise your hand.
[1:23:53] But if that's what you believe, then
[1:23:55] raise your hand. Say, "God, let me get
[1:23:57] past the barrier of my own unbelief.
[1:24:00] Whatever's in my way, Lord, don't let
[1:24:02] nothing stand in my way of a true self
[1:24:06] crucifixion." Like Paul said, "That I
[1:24:08] may know him. For I am crucified with
[1:24:11] Christ. Nevertheless, I live." Amen. God
[1:24:15] bless you. uh gather with me if you
[1:24:17] could. Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you,
[1:24:19] brother Caleb. That was so wonderful.
[1:24:21] Amen. I wrote just a whole page of
[1:24:23] notes. Amen. As he drew closer to that
[1:24:26] fire. Amen. Speaking of Moses, that fire
[1:24:29] was sent for a purpose. It was refining
[1:24:32] him. Amen. It was refining those parts
[1:24:35] of him that didn't match. Come on,
[1:24:38] friends. Please gather. Don't make me
[1:24:40] beg you. Please get out of your seat and
[1:24:41] come forward. We don't do we don't we we
[1:24:43] do this in a special way. Don't stay in
[1:24:45] your seat. Come forward. Amen. It's
[1:24:47] important. Amen. We all get get up here
[1:24:50] real close together. Amen. But you know,
[1:24:52] brother Brandham said something, Caleb.
[1:24:54] He said Moses, he said in that burning
[1:24:57] bush, what he realized was that it was
[1:25:00] something that he could speak to and it
[1:25:02] could speak back to him. And brother
[1:25:04] Brandham said, "That's the kind of
[1:25:05] experience." And I say, "Lord, that's
[1:25:07] the kind of experience I want is
[1:25:09] something that I don't just speak to,
[1:25:11] but it speaks back to me." And brother
[1:25:14] Brandham said in another place he said
[1:25:15] everything Moses lacked was in that
[1:25:18] burning bush.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me say friends whatever you
[1:25:21] lack tonight it's in the word already.
[1:25:24] All you got to do is get it get an
[1:25:25] experience. Amen. With that burning
[1:25:28] bush. Amen. To where our nature dies
[1:25:30] out. The characteristics as brother
[1:25:32] Caleb uh ministered. You know brother
[1:25:35] Vadim called it a honing time. As that
[1:25:37] headstone nears the body. Amen. And he
[1:25:41] said as that headstone nears the body,
[1:25:43] it it would begin to get so close, he
[1:25:47] said, to where it would just be a
[1:25:48] razor's edge. It was the only thing you
[1:25:50] can fit in there. And that's that's God
[1:25:52] refining our life. That refining fire,
[1:25:55] cutting off anything that that doesn't
[1:25:58] please him. And I believe the Holy
[1:26:00] Spirit is that personal in our lives
[1:26:03] that he won't allow anything, not even a
[1:26:05] speck. God won't just wink at that and
[1:26:08] let it go, but he'll keep convicting
[1:26:09] you. He'll keep anointing a man's heart
[1:26:11] to preach the word of God and keep
[1:26:14] honing you down. And I say, Lord, don't
[1:26:15] give up on me. Amen. Don't give up on
[1:26:18] me. Keep working on me, Lord Jesus.
[1:26:20] Amen. I appreciate that so much. I'm
[1:26:22] going to read the request. Amen. Here
[1:26:24] tonight, I just like brother my dad
[1:26:26] always says and brother Donnie says,
[1:26:28] "Two things that make you want to
[1:26:29] preach. A man who can't preach and a man
[1:26:30] who can." And brother Caleb certainly
[1:26:33] can. I read something Brother Brandham
[1:26:35] said as I was just uh so excited to hear
[1:26:37] the word of God. Brother Brandham says
[1:26:38] this in Patmas's vision. I think this is
[1:26:40] so good. He said, "Have you?" He He's
[1:26:42] talking about getting healing.
[1:26:45] And he says, "If you needed healing," he
[1:26:47] says, "what would you do?" He says,
[1:26:49] "Well, what does the word say to do?"
[1:26:51] We've read it countless times, but we
[1:26:53] didn't get in the spirit when we were
[1:26:55] reading it. Did we ask God for his
[1:26:59] spirit to teach us the real truth? He's
[1:27:01] talking about being healed. If we did,
[1:27:03] we'd call the elders, confess our sins,
[1:27:05] be anointed and prayed for, and that
[1:27:07] would be that. It might not come
[1:27:10] immediately, but in his spirit, it is
[1:27:13] all over. There's no other court of
[1:27:15] appeal. God will fulfill his word. Oh,
[1:27:17] we need to get in the spirit and then
[1:27:21] things will be done. Listen how he says
[1:27:23] this. Don't go through the acts first.
[1:27:27] get in the spirit and then go through
[1:27:29] the acts and watch what God will do.
[1:27:33] Have you ever noticed how the world gets
[1:27:35] in the spirit of things that are in the
[1:27:37] world? You know, you you ever noticed
[1:27:39] that?
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Have you ever noticed they go to their
[1:27:43] ball games, their sporting events, their
[1:27:45] dances, they enter into the spirit of
[1:27:48] it. They don't sit there like a
[1:27:50] wallflower all dried up and sticks. They
[1:27:53] enter right into the fill of things and
[1:27:56] become a part of things. But oh, how
[1:27:59] they hate the Christians for getting
[1:28:01] into the spirit of God's word. They call
[1:28:03] us fanatics, holy rollers. There's
[1:28:05] nothing they won't do to show their
[1:28:07] hatred. And he says, "But ignore that.
[1:28:09] You can expect it knowing where it's
[1:28:11] coming from. Just go on and get in the
[1:28:14] spirit of worship."
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Our spirit is clean. Are you glad your
[1:28:19] spirit's clean? It is fresh. It is real.
[1:28:22] Listen. He says it's sober and serious.
[1:28:26] It's sober and serious. So our spirit
[1:28:28] when we pull on the word of God, when a
[1:28:30] minister is preaching the word of God,
[1:28:32] when worship's going forth, we ought to
[1:28:34] be sober. We ought to be serious. And
[1:28:37] some of you go, "Yeah, I got that part
[1:28:38] down. We'll keep going." But
[1:28:40] nonetheless, full of the joy of the
[1:28:43] Lord. The Christian ought to be just as
[1:28:46] exuberant and full of pleasure in his
[1:28:50] Lord as the world when it savors its
[1:28:53] delights in pleasure. Both Christians
[1:28:56] and the world are human. Both have
[1:28:58] emotions. The difference is the
[1:29:00] Christians heart and emotions are purely
[1:29:03] on the Lord of glory, his love, while
[1:29:06] the world satisfies the flesh. I want to
[1:29:08] say, Lord, let me not just be serious
[1:29:10] and sober. Let me obey a prophet and
[1:29:13] have the emotion enough to enjoy my
[1:29:15] religion. How many want to say that
[1:29:17] today? Say, Lord, let me have be so full
[1:29:20] of the joy of the Lord. Church ain't a
[1:29:22] dead thing. I don't sit there like a
[1:29:23] bump on a pickle. Amen. When the
[1:29:25] preaching of the word is going forth, I
[1:29:26] pull on the word of God. Amen. You do
[1:29:29] something, watch what happens. What the
[1:29:30] Lord will do for you when you break out
[1:29:32] of your comfort zone. Amen. And really
[1:29:34] enter into the spirit of worship. Amen.
[1:29:37] Well, that was part two, brother Caleb.
[1:29:38] I apologize, but Amen. and just was
[1:29:40] burning on my heart. Brother Brad Y
[1:29:43] writes a prayer request. Says, "I desire
[1:29:44] your prayers. I leave Friday morning for
[1:29:46] Nicaragua." Brother Brad, is this
[1:29:48] tonight?
[1:29:50] So, you leave this Friday morning. My
[1:29:52] goodness. Why don't you come up here,
[1:29:53] brother? We're going to have the
[1:29:54] ministry team lay hands on you before
[1:29:56] you go. Uh, Sister Sarah going also or
[1:29:59] just you? Just you. Oh, we'll really be
[1:30:01] praying for you, brother.
[1:30:06] Amen. I leave Friday morning for
[1:30:08] Nicaragua. They have me ministering
[1:30:10] every day that I am there. My goodness.
[1:30:12] I'll be there seven days, including the
[1:30:15] youth camp that will start on Monday.
[1:30:16] Amen. We were me and Brother JD were
[1:30:18] there. We know what that's like. They'll
[1:30:20] preach you and keep preaching you. Amen.
[1:30:22] And Sister Debbie also my mom uh needing
[1:30:25] prayer. Is that right? Uh who's been
[1:30:27] sick for the last couple of days. Amen.
[1:30:30] And so we know that. Amen. There's
[1:30:32] that's all that I have here just for
[1:30:33] brother Brad and also Sister Debbie.
[1:30:35] Amen. Maybe you have something upon your
[1:30:37] heart. You just want to raise a hand to
[1:30:39] the Lord. Why don't you come, brother
[1:30:41] Caleb, and take these needs. Why don't
[1:30:42] you hold that hand up? In fact, put that
[1:30:44] hand over on your brother. Amen. Your
[1:30:46] sister. Let's just join. Amen. Arm and
[1:30:49] arm. Amen. All the requests. I'm sure
[1:30:52] that there are many, amen, that we named
[1:30:54] here tonight. And also just even the
[1:30:56] inspiration of the sermon. That's just
[1:30:58] what your request would be to say, Lord,
[1:31:00] let me die out to myself daily. Amen.
[1:31:04] Until Jesus is seen in me.

[1:31:24] Lord. And yet, you still care about us,
[1:31:27] Lord. You still care about the intricate

[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We have a testimony. Any
[1:34:25] testimonies here tonight? I'll give just
[1:34:26] a minute for that. If not, we'll let
[1:34:28] sing a song and we'll be dismissed. But
[1:34:30] I'll give just a minute for anybody who
[1:34:32] wants to share. Amen. Anything. Sister
[1:34:34] Nita.
[1:34:37] Um I think it was yesterday morning. Ken
[1:34:40] and I were driving um the truck towards
[1:34:43] our new spot in Point South and we had
[1:34:46] chairs and I don't think I strapped them
[1:34:49] very well. Um and the next thing I know
[1:34:52] he's
[1:34:54] like, "Babe, the chairs have literally
[1:34:56] flown out of the back of the truck by
[1:34:59] the air station on 21 and a semi like
[1:35:03] swerved. Cars were it was terrible.
[1:35:06] Nobody got in an accident. Nobody got
[1:35:08] hurt. And the chairs could have went
[1:35:10] through someone's windshield. And it
[1:35:11] just was just very thankful. We actually
[1:35:15] chairs weren't even broke and they're
[1:35:16] wood. So the Lord was mindful. And we
[1:35:19] just want to thank him for always
[1:35:20] watching out for us.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; I have I have one, Matt.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:28] Um, so
[1:35:31] I had got a new motorcycle again,
[1:35:34] which is kind of a testimony in itself,
[1:35:36] I guess. I traded the one I had to for
[1:35:38] this one and a little bit of money, but
[1:35:40] it needed some work. So, I got it fixed
[1:35:42] up and then, uh,
[1:35:46] story of my life, I guess. But, um, man,
[1:35:50] this week started out rough. like
[1:35:52] Sunday, like everything just went wrong.
[1:35:54] And a washer broke and a dryer broke and
[1:35:56] my phone broke because I fell off my
[1:35:59] motorcycle as I'm going down the road.
[1:36:02] And then Monday came along. I was like,
[1:36:03] "Oh, it can't be that bad." And then
[1:36:05] Monday hit hard. And I was like, "Lord,
[1:36:07] what in the world is going on? This is
[1:36:09] like this is rough." And I actually text
[1:36:12] my Jason. I was like, "Pray for me. I
[1:36:14] don't know the devil's mad or something
[1:36:15] because he's hitting us from all sides."
[1:36:18] And so today I got up and um I went to
[1:36:23] go license the motorcycle so I could
[1:36:25] legally drive it on the road. And I had
[1:36:28] tried to do some some research to see
[1:36:29] how much money it take cuz we have to
[1:36:31] pay an advorarium tax um which is a
[1:36:34] percentage of the the cost of the
[1:36:36] vehicle. And I put it in the system and
[1:36:39] it said nothing. It's like just look up
[1:36:41] the the NADA value and you can punch
[1:36:44] that in. So, it was somewhere between
[1:36:46] like $170 and $250.
[1:36:49] So, I get to the to the tag office and
[1:36:51] since I started working at the bank,
[1:36:53] everybody there knows me because they
[1:36:54] bank with us. So, I walked in, they're
[1:36:55] like, "Oh, hey, Aaron. How's it going?"
[1:36:56] I was like, "Hey." So, I need to put
[1:36:58] this title in my name. And so, the lady
[1:37:01] looked it up and she's like, "Well,
[1:37:03] there's no um there's no value in here
[1:37:06] for it." Usually, they would go over to
[1:37:08] the tax assessor and the tax assessor
[1:37:10] would tell them. She's like, "How much
[1:37:11] you pay for it?" I I said, "Well, I gave
[1:37:13] him $150 for it." She's like, "Okay."
[1:37:16] She put it in. $80 bucks.
[1:37:18] Tax, title, everything. All out the
[1:37:20] door, the taxes, everything was only
[1:37:22] $80. Like, thank you, Lord. I needed
[1:37:24] this little wind today for sure.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a hand. Amen. Anybody
[1:37:32] else? Amen.
[1:37:35] So, um, we were in Idaho this last time
[1:37:38] and when we moved here, I had like a
[1:37:40] pretty big falling out with my little
[1:37:42] sister and it's been so sad, like
[1:37:45] heartbreaking. But this time, Ashley
[1:37:47] encouraged me. She said, "Just text her
[1:37:49] like, "Want to go to lunch?" And she
[1:37:51] couldn't, but I ended up, me and my mom
[1:37:53] ended up going to her house and we were
[1:37:55] there for hours and we like laughed our
[1:37:56] heads off and it was like God restored
[1:37:58] that relationship and I was so happy
[1:38:01] about it.
[1:38:03] Thank the Lord. Amen. God can do that.
[1:38:07] Amen. I I'll testify. Thank God I'm here
[1:38:10] tonight. I didn't think I would be.
[1:38:11] Amen. The Lord wanted me to and so he
[1:38:13] touched me. Amen. Was able to come.
[1:38:15] Brother Steve said, "If I really had a
[1:38:17] man cold, I would have even came to
[1:38:18] church tonight." So, must not be a true
[1:38:21] man cold. Amen. Turn around and shake
[1:38:23] somebody's hand. Amen. Before we go,
[1:38:26] Amen. Go in the fear of the Lord. We'll
[1:38:28] see you this weekend. Take up your cross
[1:38:33] and follow Jesus.
[1:38:39] Take up your cross.
[1:38:43] Oh, every day.
[1:38:48] Oh, don't be ashamed.
[1:38:53] Oh, to say that you know him.
