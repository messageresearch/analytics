[45:42] you need it amen let's just stand and
[45:44] open our scriptures to the book of First
[45:47] Peter i' like to just speak for a few
[45:49] moments this morning on a thought that's
[45:51] maybe a little bit uh we're not going to
[45:53] be able to cover it I'll just say that
[45:55] but I I've set a timer so we'll just
[45:56] we'll get what we can this morning and I
[45:58] like to call this the door of Grace amen
[46:01] amen door of
[46:04] Grace
[46:08] amen 1 Peter 5 and the fourth verse and
[46:11] when the chief Shepherd shall appear he
[46:13] shall receive a Crown of Glory that
[46:15] fadeth not away likewise you younger
[46:19] submit yourselves unto the Elder ye all
[46:21] of you be subject one to another and be
[46:23] clothed with humility for God resisteth
[46:25] the proud and give giveth grace to the
[46:28] humble and humble yourselves therefore
[46:30] unto the mighty hand of God that he may
[46:33] exalt you in due time and casting all
[46:37] your care upon him for he careth for you
[46:42] casting all your care upon him for he
[46:44] carth for you amen father we just love
[46:47] you this morning Lord thank you for Lord
[46:50] another day of life that we could come
[46:51] and just use it to worship you this
[46:53] morning Father we thank you for breath
[46:55] in our lungs that Lord we can use to
[46:57] glorify your name this morning Lord and
[46:59] we thank you for your presence amongst
[47:01] us Lord and father how you've uh
[47:03] summoned us here this morning not to
[47:05] just Lord Fill A Seat but Lord It's a
[47:07] Divine meeting that you've ordained
[47:10] before the foundation of the world Lord
[47:11] that you would have a uh communion with
[47:14] us this morning Father and Lord as we
[47:16] just set aside this time lord and we lay
[47:19] aside our cares and Lord our thoughts of
[47:21] tomorrow and our fears of yesterday
[47:23] father but Lord we just Look to You In
[47:25] This Moment father realize izing that
[47:27] Lord only you have the words of eternal
[47:29] life Lord and only you have words
[47:31] healing Lord and only you have the words
[47:33] of victory for our life Lord and father
[47:35] we just give ourselves to you aresh Lord
[47:37] we just ask that you would use all that
[47:39] we are father Lord use our our voice our
[47:42] lips father may you just anoint them
[47:44] Father anoint these words Lord Quicken
[47:46] them Father bring them to life Lord we
[47:48] ask that you would give us Revelation to
[47:50] understand Lord as your spirit just go
[47:52] by and touch each heart and open each
[47:54] ear this morning Father as we give
[47:56] ourselves to you you in the mighty name
[47:58] of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be
[48:01] seated amen and so this is a familiar
[48:04] scripture to us that we can cast our
[48:06] cares on him for he cares for us and
[48:09] this is a kind heavenly father that has
[48:11] not just sent us here without any kind
[48:13] of help or any kind of soulless but he
[48:15] said that we could bring unto him all of
[48:17] our cares is that what the scripture
[48:18] says is cast all a all your cares upon
[48:23] Him for he cares for you so he has asked
[48:25] us to put put our cares upon him he's
[48:28] asked us to put something upon him and
[48:30] he is built to hold the load that we
[48:33] cannot carry and I I I know that we
[48:35] probably all are alike in here this
[48:36] morning that we've crossed that point in
[48:38] our life when we we can carry no more we
[48:40] can't we can't carry any more of this
[48:42] burden we cannot carry on with the with
[48:44] the with the weight of the of the world
[48:46] that's upon our shoulders and there
[48:47] comes a point when we must offload that
[48:50] to someone or to somebody and there's
[48:52] got to be somewhere for that to go right
[48:54] there's got to be there's got to be some
[48:55] place to deposit at that and he's told
[48:57] us that place is upon Him amen cast all
[49:01] your cares upon me and in the Amplified
[49:03] it would say this casting your cares all
[49:05] your anxieties all your worries and all
[49:07] your concerns once and for all on him
[49:11] and he cares about you with the deepest
[49:13] affection and watches over you very
[49:16] carefully and I like the way the
[49:17] Amplified brings that out once and for
[49:19] all so we're not casting these cares
[49:21] upon Him and then taking them back at a
[49:23] later date but once we have cast these
[49:25] cares on him they are now his cares and
[49:28] we we are free from that debt right
[49:29] we're free from carrying that load
[49:31] anymore once we have deposited on uh him
[49:34] on that and we can see that this this
[49:36] plan of God has has carried a lot of
[49:39] weight Through Time right we can take
[49:40] this all the way back to Genesis when
[49:42] when man was in perfect harmony with God
[49:44] and and Adam had perfect fellowship with
[49:47] God and I I know it's a well-taught
[49:48] church we'll just background for a
[49:50] minute that's okay and where we're going
[49:52] to get in the source of this thought and
[49:53] and and and man having that communion
[49:56] with God walking in the garden with God
[49:58] having a that evening cool experience
[50:01] with the Lord and you could just put
[50:02] yourself there it seems only as if a an
[50:05] imagination but it is a reality that man
[50:07] can have that relationship with God to
[50:10] walk with him and to talk with him and
[50:12] and to have him come and put his hand on
[50:14] your shoulder and say look look at my
[50:16] beautiful creation son and look look at
[50:18] what I've created for you and look at
[50:20] what I've done for you and I'm your kind
[50:22] heavenly father and this is the array
[50:24] that I've made for you to enjoy enjoy
[50:25] your kingdom son and enjoy this world
[50:28] that I've created for you and that was
[50:29] the relationship that Adam had with God
[50:32] right but somewhere that got interrupted
[50:35] somewhere somewhere that got interrupted
[50:37] and while Adam was with with God in that
[50:39] time he didn't have care cares he didn't
[50:42] have worries he didn't have concerns he
[50:44] didn't have fears but then all of a
[50:46] sudden the fall takes place and and fear
[50:48] immediately attaches itself to Adam
[50:50] because now he knows that there's a time
[50:53] when he when he must go to sleep he must
[50:55] go to the Grave he must go the way of of
[50:57] all of the other Kingdom and so he lost
[50:59] something there something something was
[51:01] taken from him right we could put it
[51:04] like this that that something something
[51:06] would have to fall below the reach of
[51:08] where Adam could get it something
[51:11] something fell below the reach of Adam's
[51:13] grip and Adam lost the privilege he had
[51:16] if we could maybe put a visualization to
[51:18] it as the prophet would do it would be
[51:20] like losing a set of
[51:21] keys and now you don't have that set of
[51:24] keys and so the doors that you used to
[51:26] watch through you can't walk through
[51:27] anymore because you don't have the key
[51:29] to that door right and that door remains
[51:31] locked and you don't have a way to
[51:32] unlock that door because as we beheld
[51:34] Lucifer falling from Heaven he had
[51:37] something with him that fell with him
[51:38] and that was the keys right that was the
[51:41] keys to death hell in the grave and so
[51:43] he took something with him when he fell
[51:45] and it fell below the reach of what a
[51:47] man could do and there would there would
[51:49] be a separation between man and the
[51:52] victory that Adam had there would be a
[51:54] separation between you and I when we
[51:55] were born into the this world in a
[51:57] serpent nature and and formed in sin and
[51:59] shaped in iniquity we would not have
[52:01] access to those keys that Adam lost
[52:03] because we were born under this Fallen
[52:05] nature right and so there's this
[52:06] separation automatic from birth that you
[52:08] didn't ask for you didn't volunteer for
[52:11] but you were born into this Fallen World
[52:13] and there's a separation from you and
[52:15] you're immediately attached to fear of
[52:17] death right you don't have to teach a
[52:19] child to fear death they just know it
[52:21] they know that there's something coming
[52:23] there know that there there's some
[52:24] there's something that they they have no
[52:26] control roll over and you just give a
[52:27] child a few years and and I have got
[52:30] five I know a little bit about it and
[52:32] and and they you don't have to teach
[52:34] them how to lie you don't have to teach
[52:35] them how to cheat one another you don't
[52:36] have to teach them they just learn that
[52:38] from their fallen nature right so
[52:40] there's things that there's already
[52:41] cares that were born with that we didn't
[52:43] ask for but they're here right they're
[52:45] they're in us they're they're already
[52:47] amongst us and there's things that we're
[52:48] born into but we have a way that we were
[52:51] given in this age that we could overcome
[52:54] even that Fallen nature we could over
[52:56] come that separation between man and God
[52:59] we could overcome that that Fallen
[53:00] dispensation right so something would
[53:03] have to go and retrieve those keys and
[53:05] we could just you could just go on a
[53:06] little journey with me for a moment here
[53:08] something would have to go and redeem
[53:10] what Adam lost back to the church so
[53:13] that we could have access to those doors
[53:14] again right if I had a set of keys but
[53:17] now everything's Touch button and we
[53:18] don't have set of keys anymore but but
[53:19] you can visualize a set of keys right if
[53:22] we had a set of keys this morning and
[53:24] there we can't reach them there there
[53:25] had to been somebody go to to take those
[53:27] keys and give them back to us that we
[53:30] can have access to those doors which
[53:31] Adam had right there had to have been
[53:33] something but by this God God instituted
[53:36] what we would call the
[53:38] law right after the fall of Adam there
[53:41] was laws right there would be a a law
[53:44] who wrote the Ten Commandments God did
[53:47] right there would be an institution of
[53:49] the law and and and as a fallen man
[53:51] there would be no way for us to keep
[53:53] that law there would be no way for us to
[53:55] keep that law Perfection but God wrote
[53:58] the law as a standard right he wrote it
[54:00] as a standard that we would have
[54:02] something to strive to to to live above
[54:04] the the Fallen nature that we were born
[54:06] into and so he instituted the law
[54:09] knowing that there was already a debt
[54:10] upon Adam that no man could redeem right
[54:14] there was already a a a a a Breaking of
[54:17] the law that Adam committed that no just
[54:20] just no man could redeem but it would
[54:22] take it would take someone that was
[54:24] built to go down to where those keys
[54:26] were and redeem what Adam lost so it
[54:29] just to make this clearer picture what
[54:32] Adam lost was was the
[54:34] access to to Hell death in the grave
[54:37] there there there there was an access
[54:39] Interruption where he didn't have the
[54:41] power over sickness anymore Adam didn't
[54:43] have the power over death anymore Adam
[54:45] didn't have the power of eternal life
[54:47] anymore but he lost access to that when
[54:50] Lucifer fell to hell right I hope we are
[54:52] we okay to this morning when Lucifer
[54:55] fell to hell he took those keys with him
[54:57] and they were out of Adam's reach right
[55:00] well something would have to be heavy
[55:02] enough to go down to where those keys
[55:05] went and redeem back what Adam lost
[55:07] right so it would take somebody built
[55:09] for that situation to go down to where
[55:11] Lucifer was and redeemed back all that
[55:14] was lost by the Fall Right all brother B
[55:17] said in fundamental foundations of the
[55:18] faith that we can be restored back to a
[55:21] a a a Eden an Eden Covenant with God
[55:24] where all that Adam lost Christ resp
[55:26] restored back to the church right that's
[55:28] our goal this morning is to have
[55:30] communion to walk with God and you know
[55:32] when you're with when you know when
[55:33] you're a small child you know maybe
[55:35] you're just three or four years old and
[55:37] you might have a fear or a worry or a a
[55:39] care but you know when when you crawl up
[55:41] in Daddy's lap it seems to go away it
[55:44] just it just seems to go away that you
[55:45] know what was just this big shadow on
[55:47] the wall when you find yourself on Dad's
[55:49] lap that fear is not so big anymore and
[55:51] the monster under the bed's not so big
[55:53] anymore and you know the shadow on the
[55:54] wall isn't creepy anymore when comes in
[55:56] and turns on the light and you see that
[55:58] it was just it was just it was just a
[56:00] fear and there was no reality to it but
[56:02] it took sitting on Dad's lap in order
[56:04] for that to come to pass and I believe
[56:05] that's us this morning as we have a
[56:07] heavenly father that all of these
[56:09] worries and all of these fears and all
[56:11] of these conditions and stripes and
[56:12] struggles and trials when we get on the
[56:15] lap of the father and we realize they're
[56:17] just a shadow or it's just a it's just a
[56:19] defeated enemy or it's something we
[56:20] don't have to be afraid of we have a
[56:22] light turned on to us so we can see
[56:24] there's not Superstition anymore but we
[56:26] are looking at a reality of a communion
[56:29] with our heavenly father and that's our
[56:31] that's our deepest desire as a child of
[56:33] God is to have that restored back where
[56:35] we can have that fellowship with him
[56:37] right we can have that Fellowship
[56:39] restored with him when we're not worried
[56:40] about tomorrow because we know Daddy's
[56:42] got tomorrow he our father has control
[56:45] of tomorrow's situation and tomorrow's
[56:47] struggles and tomorrow's fears and
[56:49] tomorrow's worries he's already got it
[56:51] in control and he's already made a way
[56:53] for us to get through those fears and
[56:55] through those trials if we could just
[56:57] remain on his lap if I could put it like
[56:59] that it's a simple analogy but when
[57:00] you're a little child there's nothing
[57:01] better than Daddy's lap right there's
[57:04] nothing better than sitting on your
[57:05] dad's lap because you know everything's
[57:07] going to be okay everything's going to
[57:08] be fine and and you know and we're not
[57:10] we're not typing the the Fallen nature
[57:12] of this of this world where fathers
[57:13] don't know how to be real fathers and
[57:15] mothers don't know how to be real
[57:16] mothers but I'm talking about a god-
[57:18] calleded father and a god- calleded
[57:19] mother that you know that your heart's
[57:21] desire is you would you would die
[57:23] tomorrow for your children you would die
[57:25] in an instant for your children children
[57:26] why because they're your heart they're
[57:29] you they're they're they're that part of
[57:31] you they're they're that all of your
[57:33] favorites are are are are funneled down
[57:35] into your child you know and you could
[57:36] see yourself in them and some of them
[57:37] you don't like and some of them you do
[57:39] like but they're traits that come
[57:41] down through genealogy and you would do
[57:43] anything for that child and you would
[57:45] you would do and that's that's our
[57:46] heavenly father but all of the traits
[57:49] that he sees in us are good traits all
[57:51] the traits he sees in us are from him
[57:53] and their Divine traits to overcome and
[57:56] this age and as he's watching us
[57:58] struggle through this he's just saying
[57:59] cast your cares on me and it won't be so
[58:02] heavy amen just lay what you're what
[58:05] you're under the burden of upon me and
[58:07] I'll take it right that's the scripture
[58:09] lay your yoke upon me and take
[58:13] mine if we could break that down into
[58:15] proper English just T put put take off
[58:17] your load that you're carrying give it
[58:19] to him and take his cuz he's not
[58:20] carrying
[58:21] one his yoke is light his yoke is easy
[58:25] his his his yoke is freedom his yoke is
[58:28] liberating his his yoke is is to have to
[58:31] have joy unspeakable and full of Glory
[58:33] because you know that you are already a
[58:35] winner you're not wondering if I'm a
[58:37] winner you will know you're already a
[58:39] winner so something had to transfer here
[58:41] because you were born with the brother
[58:43] Caleb you were born with a weight upon
[58:45] your shoulders that you didn't ask for
[58:46] and as as life has come on that weight
[58:49] has gotten greater and greater and
[58:51] stronger and more and more and the and
[58:53] the further down life's Road you go the
[58:55] more cares you put on your
[58:57] shoulders and so you get to a point
[58:59] where you can't carry that load anymore
[59:02] you can't carry that burden anymore so
[59:04] you've got to have somewhere to lay it
[59:05] down and he's invited us to lay that
[59:08] care upon his feet now I know this is
[59:09] real Elementary but just bear with me as
[59:11] we build this Foundation but you're
[59:13] you're you're carrying something that
[59:14] you're going to deposit upon him and
[59:17] where does that go amen does it just
[59:20] disappear when you deposit it on him but
[59:23] there's the real it'd be like it it'd be
[59:25] like me uh
[59:26] asking asking brother Luther can I
[59:28] borrow 500
[59:30] bucks he says yes okay but I owe him
[59:34] $500 right and be like brother Caleb
[59:36] call me tomorrow and say hey you know
[59:38] what that $500 you borrowed from Brother
[59:40] Luther you don't owe it to him
[59:42] anymore well brother Luther's gonna say
[59:44] wait a
[59:46] minute that guy borrowed $500 from me
[59:49] what do you mean he doesn't know it
[59:50] anymore well somebody's going to have to
[59:52] pay back that debt somebody's going to
[59:55] have to sign my name off of that because
[59:57] when I borrowed it from him I signed a
[59:59] receipt saying I borrowed this money
[1:00:01] from you and now I'm liable for that
[1:00:03] money but then I hear another voice tell
[1:00:05] me I don't owe that money but where'd
[1:00:08] the money
[1:00:09] go it's still there somewhere right it
[1:00:11] doesn't just disappear but there's
[1:00:13] somebody that's got to pay that debt so
[1:00:15] I hope you're you're tracking with me
[1:00:16] this morning and that's that's us going
[1:00:19] through this life is is we have we have
[1:00:21] become indebted to sin we have a long
[1:00:24] list a long record of all of these
[1:00:27] mistakes and faults and where we
[1:00:28] couldn't keep the law and where we fell
[1:00:30] short of the grace of God and where we
[1:00:32] where we couldn't couldn't do our
[1:00:33] heart's desire and we fell into sin and
[1:00:36] now we have somebody following us with a
[1:00:38] little black book recording everything
[1:00:40] that we've done in life right and they
[1:00:41] said here on this day you did this write
[1:00:44] it in the book and all these cares are
[1:00:47] are coming down upon and it's hard to
[1:00:49] keep a victory when you know there's
[1:00:50] this big black book that all that you
[1:00:52] did yesterday and last year and the year
[1:00:54] before I I think we're together now I
[1:00:56] can feel that we're making a connection
[1:00:58] and all all that you had in years past
[1:01:00] has now been recorded in this book and
[1:01:02] is following you around saying you can't
[1:01:04] do this because on this day you
[1:01:07] committed this and you still owe this
[1:01:09] right we're in the large we're the
[1:01:10] largest debt carriers that there is is
[1:01:13] the sinner that is saved by grace
[1:01:15] because we know we know all of the debt
[1:01:18] that that it didn't just disappear but
[1:01:20] it had to go somewhere right and when I
[1:01:22] would fall short of the glory of God
[1:01:24] there would be Satan to record down on
[1:01:26] this day you borrowed this Sin from me
[1:01:29] right on this day you committed this sin
[1:01:32] and I recorded it in my book now now we
[1:01:34] come to Calvary and we come to a cross
[1:01:36] and we hear a voice say you don't owe
[1:01:38] that sin but you can go free you're not
[1:01:41] under the bondage of sin anymore but you
[1:01:43] can go free well where does the sin
[1:01:47] go it's in the book it's been recorded
[1:01:51] there's somebody that needs to pay the
[1:01:53] debt that we owe right it'd be like be
[1:01:56] like let's just put ourselves in the
[1:01:57] shoes of of the woman at the Jesus was
[1:02:00] there and he was invited to a feast
[1:02:02] right he was invited to a feast of a
[1:02:04] Pharisee and we we know the backstory in
[1:02:06] this we're not going to take the time to
[1:02:07] preach on it but but he was invited
[1:02:09] there to be made fun of right he wasn't
[1:02:11] invited there to be worshiped and a lot
[1:02:12] of churches out there this morning are
[1:02:14] gathering and they say that they've
[1:02:15] invited Jesus but they haven't invited
[1:02:16] him to worship Him they've invited him
[1:02:18] to let him sit in the corner with dirty
[1:02:20] feet but not us this morning we
[1:02:22] recognize that the authority of Jesus
[1:02:24] Christ is in this building and we will
[1:02:25] will not let him sit with dirty feet in
[1:02:27] the corner but we recognize the Supreme
[1:02:29] deity of Jesus Christ in this age and I
[1:02:32] choose to wash his feet I choose to wash
[1:02:35] his feet I choose to clean his feet and
[1:02:37] to praise him and to worship Him and
[1:02:40] humble myself that he may give me
[1:02:43] Grace that's right we're not going to
[1:02:45] make it of our own accord or our own
[1:02:46] merits or how well we can keep the law
[1:02:48] as good a person as you are you have not
[1:02:50] kept the whole law as good a person as
[1:02:53] you are you have not kept every line and
[1:02:55] every jot and every tit you have not why
[1:02:57] because we are born under a fallen
[1:02:59] condition and the only one that can keep
[1:03:02] a perfect law is the perfect one who
[1:03:04] wrote it
[1:03:05] himself so we will not make it by our
[1:03:08] own accord or by our own will or how how
[1:03:10] religious we can be in fact it may take
[1:03:12] us further away because that Pharisee
[1:03:14] was a religious man and yet he didn't
[1:03:16] recognize who was room and there Jesus
[1:03:20] the savior of the world has come into
[1:03:22] his house and he doesn't greet them he
[1:03:24] doesn't welcome him he's too busy car on
[1:03:26] with traditions and too busy carrying on
[1:03:28] with what he thinks is important look at
[1:03:30] that man over there out look at that you
[1:03:31] know I if if he would have recognized
[1:03:34] who it was that came into his
[1:03:36] house all eyes would have been on him
[1:03:41] yeah I don't want to yeah I don't want
[1:03:43] to use the presidents or you I want to
[1:03:44] get into politics but if your hero
[1:03:46] walked in the room or somebody that you
[1:03:47] reverence and
[1:03:49] respect let's just let go back a couple
[1:03:51] hundred years if Abraham Lincoln walked
[1:03:52] into the room you have a built in
[1:03:55] respect for him right you're going to
[1:03:57] clear off a seat for him you're going to
[1:03:58] say no take take the comfy
[1:04:00] chair take the recliner no can I get you
[1:04:03] a water do you want it room temp do you
[1:04:04] want it cold you want a coffee do you
[1:04:06] want tea right we're waiting on him why
[1:04:09] because we recognize there's a respect
[1:04:12] there there's something that that man
[1:04:14] has achieved that we reverence and we
[1:04:16] respect right and how many times have we
[1:04:19] come into these doors into this church
[1:04:21] and not realizing that Jesus Christ is
[1:04:23] walking in the room and we don't real
[1:04:25] realiz the importance of the person
[1:04:27] who's sitting next to us or or or moving
[1:04:30] amongst us or walking down our Pew or
[1:04:32] who is W looking for a seat somewhere is
[1:04:34] there a heart somewhere that I can sit
[1:04:35] in but if we really knew who was in the
[1:04:37] room we say my seat you can have my seat
[1:04:40] you can have my chair I'll gladly get up
[1:04:42] and give you my chair come into my heart
[1:04:44] and consume me if we recognize the power
[1:04:47] of the one that is in the room with us
[1:04:50] it would be a whole different situation
[1:04:52] we wouldn't be wondering well should I
[1:04:53] go to church today or should I not but
[1:04:55] the most important person in the world
[1:04:57] has promised to meet you here this
[1:04:59] morning and we wonder if we should get
[1:05:01] dressed and come to church but I say
[1:05:03] it's time to surrender all that we are
[1:05:06] and get serious with God and recognize
[1:05:08] that this is the moment this is the
[1:05:10] season this is the hour amen
[1:05:14] surrendering all and letting him have
[1:05:17] your seat right because there's a seat
[1:05:19] on the inside of you whether you know it
[1:05:21] or not it's time to let him have that
[1:05:23] seat and recognize who's in there
[1:05:25] recognize who's in the room and wash his
[1:05:27] feet now now now I didn't mean to spend
[1:05:29] that much time on that there but this
[1:05:31] woman comes into this Feast of the
[1:05:33] Pharisee
[1:05:35] right and there Jesus is back in the
[1:05:37] corner somewhere and he's defying
[1:05:39] everything that he's just taught his
[1:05:41] disciples he say it's not the way of the
[1:05:42] Pharisee it's not the way of the
[1:05:44] tradition it's not the way and then he
[1:05:45] gets invited to this feast and he says
[1:05:47] yeah we'll
[1:05:48] go and and the disciples are saying what
[1:05:50] do you mean we'll go you told us that's
[1:05:52] not the way you said you're not in the
[1:05:53] synagogue and you're not why are you
[1:05:55] going to this fancy party said because
[1:05:57] there's one person
[1:05:59] there I'll suffer humility because
[1:06:03] there's one person there I'll take on
[1:06:06] the reproach I'll take on whatever the
[1:06:07] critics have to say I'll take on
[1:06:09] whatever brother ma'am type that
[1:06:10] Pharisees party as the Hall of critics
[1:06:13] right and she had to walk through the
[1:06:15] Hall of critics now I don't have to ask
[1:06:17] you this morning if you walked through
[1:06:18] the same Hall but you're still serving
[1:06:20] God this morning so I know that you
[1:06:22] walked through a hall of
[1:06:24] critics and still here right you're
[1:06:27] still serving you're still pressing on
[1:06:29] despite all of the criticisms and that's
[1:06:31] what she had to endure as she began to
[1:06:33] walk in that room and all of those men
[1:06:35] in there knew exactly what she was they
[1:06:38] knew exactly who she was what she had
[1:06:39] committed what she had done and by the
[1:06:41] law she should have been stoned
[1:06:44] right and they watch her as she comes
[1:06:47] and she doesn't she doesn't look to them
[1:06:48] in the left or the right and that's how
[1:06:50] we got to be with criticism we're not
[1:06:51] looking at what the critics have to say
[1:06:53] because let me just say it like this a
[1:06:54] Critic will always be a Critic critics
[1:06:57] do what they do best and they criticize
[1:06:59] anything you do well that's too wild or
[1:07:01] that's too emotional or that's too dead
[1:07:03] or that's too critics will always be
[1:07:05] critics no matter what you do so don't
[1:07:07] listen to the critics and move on with
[1:07:09] the word of God and let the critics
[1:07:10] criticize because that's what they do
[1:07:12] best but Believers believe that's what
[1:07:15] they do best is carry on and believe the
[1:07:17] word no matter what anybody else is
[1:07:19] saying on the left or the right but you
[1:07:20] know that you've had a relationship with
[1:07:22] God that has told you to march on walk
[1:07:25] walk on with God Walk on beond the
[1:07:27] critics walk on beyond what they have to
[1:07:29] say or what they I don't really care
[1:07:30] what a Critic has to say because you
[1:07:32] know what one day that voice of the
[1:07:34] critic will
[1:07:37] cease one day what that critic has to
[1:07:39] say it will cease but where your voice
[1:07:42] is coming from it will never cease the
[1:07:44] voice that you're listening to it will
[1:07:46] never have an end but it will always say
[1:07:48] come forward it will always say March on
[1:07:51] brother said there's only one message of
[1:07:52] the Holy Ghost move forward
[1:07:55] amen move forward I think that's easy
[1:07:58] enough for us to get right move forward
[1:08:00] in God go beyond the criticism go beyond
[1:08:04] what so and so
[1:08:06] thinks go beyond what I think go into
[1:08:09] the holy of
[1:08:11] holies that's what the voice is telling
[1:08:13] us to do but we've got to walk through
[1:08:15] the Hall of critics to get there we're
[1:08:17] not going to get there by by by by
[1:08:19] taking this guy's opinion or this guy's
[1:08:21] opinion we've got to lay aside every
[1:08:23] care and that's what this woman did was
[1:08:26] she walked through that Hall of critics
[1:08:28] but she knew my eye is fixed on the one
[1:08:30] that can change my situation my eye my
[1:08:33] hope is fixed on the one I have not kept
[1:08:35] the law she was a Jew she knew the law
[1:08:37] and she should have been killed she
[1:08:39] should have been Stoned by their law
[1:08:40] this was the law that God
[1:08:43] wrote and she knew she was she was she
[1:08:46] was destined for hell she was destined
[1:08:48] for a Stony grave but she had a
[1:08:50] revelation to know if I can just get to
[1:08:53] Jesus if I can just get to the one that
[1:08:56] can take away my situation that can take
[1:08:58] away my past he can take away my history
[1:09:01] if we could just type it like this she's
[1:09:02] walking down this road and and all
[1:09:04] behind her is is a to put it into a a
[1:09:08] tangible it's it's a scroll right with
[1:09:10] all of her sins and mistakes following
[1:09:12] her into that room because it's been
[1:09:15] recorded right because somebody a a
[1:09:18] Taskmaster has come and recorded every
[1:09:20] mistake that she's ever made and as
[1:09:22] she's walking in this room there's just
[1:09:23] a Long Trail oh I don't know about you
[1:09:25] church but I can type myself right here
[1:09:27] because that's how I was when I came to
[1:09:29] the Lord a long trail of mistakes a long
[1:09:32] trail of of of situations that I should
[1:09:35] not have been in but there they were
[1:09:37] recorded somewhere but when I came to
[1:09:39] him I felt those weights come off of
[1:09:42] Meen come unto me all ye that labor in
[1:09:45] are heavy lad and I will give you rest
[1:09:48] and as as she comes and she I can just
[1:09:50] put myself in her shoes as she begins to
[1:09:52] get closer to that anointing brother
[1:09:53] Caleb you know what it's like when you
[1:09:55] when you step into an anointing and you
[1:09:57] feel that there's another presence in
[1:09:58] here besides just me and you there's
[1:10:00] there's there's an invisible presence in
[1:10:02] here that I can feel and as she walks
[1:10:04] into this
[1:10:06] anointing I'm
[1:10:08] unworthy I should just turn around and
[1:10:10] run I should just go he's I'm unworthy
[1:10:13] to even be here I'm unworthy to be
[1:10:15] standing where I'm standing how am I
[1:10:17] going to approach this this man without
[1:10:20] sin and me so
[1:10:24] dirty how am I going to come into His
[1:10:26] presence when I I'm So Unworthy to be
[1:10:29] here but yet he came there just for
[1:10:34] her he took on he took on the reproach
[1:10:38] just for her there they were making fun
[1:10:40] of him there and his desire was for one
[1:10:44] his desire was for her and he forsook
[1:10:47] all of The Prestige of heaven and came
[1:10:49] down just for one and sat in the Hall of
[1:10:52] critics just for one and that one was
[1:10:54] not some glorious spotless saint but he
[1:10:57] knew on the inside of that woman was an
[1:10:59] eternal seed that he had put there
[1:11:01] before the foundation of the world he
[1:11:03] said I have a meeting I have an
[1:11:05] appointment to make and he never misses
[1:11:08] an appointment and on the inside of you
[1:11:10] is an eternal seed that he put there
[1:11:13] before the foundation of the world and
[1:11:15] he will ensure that you make your
[1:11:17] appointment he will cause himself to get
[1:11:20] in front of you that you have to bump
[1:11:21] into him that you have to bump into him
[1:11:23] at some point in life because there's a
[1:11:26] seed within you and despite our own
[1:11:28] mistakes despite our own disappointments
[1:11:31] we had an intersection with
[1:11:33] Christ maybe that intersection is for
[1:11:35] you this morning but he's causing you to
[1:11:37] bump into him he's causing you to bump
[1:11:39] into him because he will not lose one he
[1:11:42] will not leave one hoof behind he will
[1:11:44] not forget a thought I know the thoughts
[1:11:46] that I think towards you he's not a
[1:11:47] forgetful God he knows where his
[1:11:50] thoughts are he knows your name he knows
[1:11:53] your situation and he's he's working
[1:11:55] everything for your good amen oh my and
[1:11:57] you think you go through situations how
[1:11:59] could this be for my good but his
[1:12:01] thoughts are not our thoughts his ways
[1:12:04] are not our ways but he is working
[1:12:06] everything for our good because he knows
[1:12:09] the
[1:12:11] outcome he knows what we have need
[1:12:15] of he knows what would take us away or
[1:12:18] bring us closer he's working everything
[1:12:21] for our good that we could bump into him
[1:12:26] and here she comes just trembling before
[1:12:29] the Lord approaching him I can't hardly
[1:12:33] preach this but got getting too
[1:12:34] emotional so I'm just going to try to
[1:12:35] preach it and not get into
[1:12:37] the and she she approaches his feet and
[1:12:40] she knows what she's
[1:12:45] carrying she knows the load she's
[1:12:49] under now she begins to you can't hide
[1:12:51] anything from
[1:12:52] him she gets into that presence and
[1:12:54] everything becomes
[1:12:56] open everything becomes an open book to
[1:12:58] her am she's remembering things she
[1:13:01] didn't even
[1:13:02] know I shouldn't be
[1:13:06] here and she probably had this whole
[1:13:08] speech rehearsed she was going to pray
[1:13:11] this beautiful
[1:13:12] speech but when she got into his
[1:13:14] presence she couldn't say anything amen
[1:13:18] she couldn't say nothing because she
[1:13:19] knew who she was and she knew she was
[1:13:22] unworthy there's no words good
[1:13:24] enough she said all that I have is in
[1:13:26] this box everything that I have is in
[1:13:29] this box this oil and she began to
[1:13:31] anoint his feet right brother BR said
[1:13:33] the oil wasn't the only thing she
[1:13:34] brought but she brought the water and
[1:13:36] the towels she brought the praise and
[1:13:39] the glory she praised him and she
[1:13:42] glorified him no matter what situation
[1:13:45] she was in so let me just settle this
[1:13:46] for you if you think you're bad in sin
[1:13:48] you're not as bad as she was if you
[1:13:50] think you're too far for God's grace to
[1:13:52] reach you you are not as far gone as she
[1:13:54] was
[1:13:55] so you need to kick that out the door
[1:13:57] because that's not an excuse anymore
[1:13:59] because what she did you can also do to
[1:14:02] recognize the power of the one in the
[1:14:04] room with praise and glory she praised
[1:14:07] him and she glorified him and she gave
[1:14:09] him all that she was everything she had
[1:14:12] was in that box every possession that
[1:14:14] she had was in that box and she poured
[1:14:16] it all out upon him why because she knew
[1:14:19] that this was her only chance to be free
[1:14:22] from that
[1:14:24] weight am wow and now she begins to
[1:14:27] praise him he says words that no man
[1:14:29] could say no man could say those words
[1:14:32] he says thy sins are you hearing me
[1:14:34] Church thy sins which were many he
[1:14:38] didn't he didn't dispute that they
[1:14:39] didn't happen they did happen they were
[1:14:41] real Sin thy sins which were many are
[1:14:45] all washed away are all
[1:14:50] forgiven you don't owe them
[1:14:52] anymore but she's looking at this l list
[1:14:55] of sins behind her they're all forgiven
[1:14:58] they're all washed away it's as if you
[1:15:01] never did it in the first
[1:15:05] place hallu where did they
[1:15:11] go somebody had to take them the devil
[1:15:14] was right there say wait a
[1:15:17] minute she owes
[1:15:21] me you ever been out to eat at a
[1:15:23] restaurant and you go to pay your bill
[1:15:25] you find out somebody else already paid
[1:15:28] it who was it you see brother Jason
[1:15:30] waving in the
[1:15:32] corner wait that was my food I ate that
[1:15:36] somebody already paid the
[1:15:38] bill so it would be like this it would
[1:15:41] be like Jesus coming down to your table
[1:15:44] saying let me get that
[1:15:45] tab let me pick up that tab let me pick
[1:15:49] up that put my name on that tell them at
[1:15:51] the front I got you tell them there I I
[1:15:55] I'll pay this debt they know me put it
[1:15:57] on my account put it on my account put
[1:16:00] it on my account now we could just count
[1:16:02] up the sins that have taken place just
[1:16:03] of of us few in this room put it on my
[1:16:06] account let alone all of the sins of the
[1:16:09] world put it on my account put it on my
[1:16:12] tab where did those sins go somebody had
[1:16:14] to owe them right let's just step into
[1:16:17] this story I I these are all quotes but
[1:16:18] I know you're a Tau church so you you
[1:16:20] know I'm in the you know I'm in the
[1:16:21] message brother brandom is talking about
[1:16:23] a story of a man a preacher in the in
[1:16:25] the 30s or 40s his name was Daniel Curry
[1:16:28] right and Daniel Curry has a has a a
[1:16:31] dream I believe it is where he he dies
[1:16:33] and he goes to what he views as the
[1:16:35] Pearly Gates Right and there he is at
[1:16:37] the Pearly Gates in his in his uh uh
[1:16:40] uneducated way of thinking this is uh
[1:16:41] this is the gates of heaven right and
[1:16:44] there Peter is at the gate and you know
[1:16:45] it's the typical Christian view of the
[1:16:47] Heavenly Gates Right and and there he's
[1:16:49] at the gate and and you know he's he's a
[1:16:51] reverend he's you know he's a
[1:16:52] respectable person and you know
[1:16:54] everybody you know shakes his hand and
[1:16:55] tips their hat to him here on Earth but
[1:16:56] then he has a dream where he goes up to
[1:16:58] this gate and he comes up to this gate
[1:16:59] and he says well I'm Reverend Daniel
[1:17:01] Curry my name's on that
[1:17:04] list and there the the angel at the gate
[1:17:06] starts flipping through the book no no I
[1:17:08] don't see I don't see a reverend Daniel
[1:17:11] Curry uh D
[1:17:15] Curry no I don't see that I don't see
[1:17:18] that name on the
[1:17:20] list he says well what happens if I'm
[1:17:23] not on the list well on the list I have
[1:17:25] to send you to the white Throne
[1:17:27] judgment I have to send you before the
[1:17:30] judge are you sure I'm not on that list
[1:17:32] I don't see you on the list so to the
[1:17:35] Judgment he goes right because that's
[1:17:36] God's
[1:17:38] law and there he's at the Judgment I
[1:17:40] believe probably anybody who's ever
[1:17:42] grown up in church is the most feared
[1:17:44] phrase in our in our vocabulary the
[1:17:46] white the great white Throne judgment
[1:17:47] right because we know how unworthy we
[1:17:50] are we know that we cannot keep the law
[1:17:52] we know that there's no way for us to
[1:17:54] attain a life worthy of the Gospel we
[1:17:57] know that so our only hope is that we
[1:18:01] get judged here by the Holy Ghost and we
[1:18:03] don't have to meet him at that judgment
[1:18:04] but we are being judged now according to
[1:18:08] our hearts
[1:18:09] right that's that's why we come and if
[1:18:11] you maybe maybe if you're a young person
[1:18:12] you're not sure why we do this we're
[1:18:14] being judged now this is the Judgment of
[1:18:17] the Bride now the Holy Ghost the tutor
[1:18:19] the guide the leader the spirit of Truth
[1:18:21] he's amongst us judging us now right so
[1:18:24] that we don't have to meet him at the
[1:18:25] Judgment later but there must be
[1:18:27] somebody raised up to be the standard of
[1:18:29] judgment and I just want to encourage
[1:18:31] you this morning that's you you are the
[1:18:33] one that will be raised up as the
[1:18:35] standard of Judgment at that time that
[1:18:37] they kept my word they did it they did
[1:18:39] it despite the opposition and the fears
[1:18:41] and the worries they kept my word the
[1:18:44] standard has been raised in this age I
[1:18:46] believe I'm looking at the standard of
[1:18:48] the age of leoa it's the bride coming
[1:18:51] out we've kept the word
[1:18:55] so we don't have to look for that
[1:18:57] judgment but here he is at this judgment
[1:18:59] and he's he's fearful he's afraid he
[1:19:03] knows that there's a greater power there
[1:19:06] behind that behind that uh Pulpit than
[1:19:10] him the judge begins to look over his
[1:19:13] case and flips his
[1:19:15] file Daniel
[1:19:17] Curry
[1:19:20] yes says here on
[1:19:23] Earth did you you ever did you ever
[1:19:27] lie
[1:19:29] yeah yeah I guess I
[1:19:32] did did you ever did you ever cheat
[1:19:34] somebody in business did you ever do
[1:19:36] something that wasn't just
[1:19:38] right yeah I guess I
[1:19:41] have did you ever look upon a woman yeah
[1:19:44] I I guess I have begins to go down this
[1:19:47] list and he's now listing down all of
[1:19:50] the sins of Daniel Curry's life and he
[1:19:52] said in that moment he realized that he
[1:19:54] was so insufficient to be where he was
[1:19:57] standing am he was so not ready to be
[1:20:00] standing before this great Authority
[1:20:01] that was speaking to him and the and the
[1:20:04] judge begins to read this down and and
[1:20:07] lay down the law and said this is the
[1:20:08] law and this is the law and the law and
[1:20:10] the law and the judge is about to to to
[1:20:13] drop the gavel and said by the law of
[1:20:15] God I have no choice but to send you to
[1:20:17] Hell according to your works on Earth
[1:20:19] and as the as the as the gavel is about
[1:20:21] to drop now you can put yourself in
[1:20:23] these shoes because this is us
[1:20:25] and as the gavel is about to drop all of
[1:20:27] a sudden he said he heard a voice he
[1:20:30] heard a voice cry out sweeter than any
[1:20:32] mother's voice ever shouted and said
[1:20:34] wait on Earth Daniel Curry stood for me
[1:20:39] and now I will stand for him and he
[1:20:43] turned to look and what did he see he
[1:20:45] saw the Lord Jesus Christ speaking out
[1:20:47] over his life it was a voice of Grace
[1:20:50] that came out where the law would have
[1:20:52] sent him to Hell Grace stood in the gap
[1:20:54] for him Grace stood in that place where
[1:20:57] he should have been
[1:20:59] Grace well the judge had just listed all
[1:21:02] of these sins where did they
[1:21:07] go put them on
[1:21:09] me cast all your cares on me for I care
[1:21:13] for you and all of those sins of Daniel
[1:21:16] Curry and all of the sins of the woman
[1:21:18] in the room and there let's just drop
[1:21:19] into a story brother brandom is it pulls
[1:21:21] over to eat at a restaurant one time
[1:21:24] and he walks in this building and
[1:21:26] there's a scene unfolding there
[1:21:27] inappropriate scene with with two men
[1:21:29] and a woman there a waitress that was
[1:21:31] there and and just just the sin of leoa
[1:21:34] right and there he finds himself all
[1:21:36] shaking his head there the fall of
[1:21:38] humanity and and and he goes you know
[1:21:40] goes back in the in a table and he said
[1:21:42] just like that I was in a vision and I
[1:21:44] was caught
[1:21:45] out and I saw like the world like a like
[1:21:48] the the the the globe like a fog around
[1:21:51] it and there was Jesus on the cross
[1:21:54] above it
[1:21:55] and there was these black Shadows coming
[1:21:56] out of the world out of the globe out of
[1:21:59] this fog and there Jesus was on the
[1:22:01] cross and he reaches out and grabs the
[1:22:03] Shadow and takes it unto himself and he
[1:22:06] said I realized that these Shadows were
[1:22:08] sins that were coming out of the world
[1:22:10] and every time of sin would begin to go
[1:22:11] up to the heavens Jesus on the cross
[1:22:14] would reach out and grab that shadow and
[1:22:15] take it unto
[1:22:17] himself brother the said what are these
[1:22:19] the sins of the
[1:22:21] world and the voice tells him no they're
[1:22:24] your sins am amen these are the sins of
[1:22:28] Bill
[1:22:31] brandham oh my how little he felt
[1:22:34] recognizing his
[1:22:35] insufficiency recognizing that there's
[1:22:37] no man ever born in sin that could be
[1:22:41] worthy to stand in that presence but
[1:22:43] there was one on the cross who would
[1:22:45] reach out in another
[1:22:47] dimension now we don't have time to get
[1:22:49] into all the details here but I I feel
[1:22:51] like we're together in this and
[1:22:57] how long ago was
[1:22:58] Calvary this is in this is in 1950
[1:23:02] something this is taking place and he's
[1:23:04] having a vision of Jesus on the cross
[1:23:08] reaching out and taking his sins that
[1:23:10] were happening at that moment in
[1:23:13] time how long ago was that but brother B
[1:23:16] says time is not what we think it is
[1:23:19] time is not just the way that we think
[1:23:20] it is but it's a little bit different
[1:23:22] than that he says he says now this great
[1:23:24] chain of perfection was broken of time
[1:23:26] and space and time came because of sin
[1:23:29] and let's draw a picture of time let's
[1:23:30] see A Perfect Circle forever forever
[1:23:33] right and then all at once sin dropped
[1:23:36] in and put a little as my wife calls it
[1:23:37] a little hickey or a little drop in the
[1:23:39] chain so it comes now in eternity
[1:23:41] continues on but now not in its perfect
[1:23:45] condition and here's a little Gap that
[1:23:47] comes down and breaks over this way and
[1:23:48] goes out that way God had to do that
[1:23:50] because Satan caused it and it dropped
[1:23:53] down to a space of time for the trying
[1:23:56] and perfecting or for the purging of the
[1:23:59] Lost God by his Sovereign Grace that God
[1:24:03] by his Sovereign Grace might someday
[1:24:05] lift that little hickey or Gap back into
[1:24:08] the perfect circle and then she rolls on
[1:24:10] just the same do you see it he says time
[1:24:13] now time is in this little Loop it Loops
[1:24:15] down and Jesus was born from eternity
[1:24:18] Jesus was from eternity to Eternity but
[1:24:21] he stepped into the time space and was
[1:24:23] made F and came through here in order to
[1:24:26] sanctify or put a streak of blood all
[1:24:29] across this place to redeem it and
[1:24:31] connect it back with God again for all
[1:24:34] eternity he says do you see it that's
[1:24:37] all time
[1:24:38] is so time is not just like what we
[1:24:41] think it is but it's a tool in the hand
[1:24:43] of God that he is using to perfect the
[1:24:46] church to put a streak of of blood and
[1:24:48] Redemption across your
[1:24:50] life that's why we're in time amen so
[1:24:54] brother here is in time some 2,000 years
[1:24:57] after the literal cross but there in
[1:24:59] another dimension Jesus is still on the
[1:25:01] cross and as that sin's being committed
[1:25:04] he's reaching out and atoning for that
[1:25:05] sin let me say this morning he's still
[1:25:08] there he's still atoning he's still
[1:25:11] giving Grace he's still showing Mercy by
[1:25:15] the law brother brandom should have been
[1:25:16] set to hell but by
[1:25:18] Grace excuse me by grace that that arm
[1:25:23] reached out and grabbed what was
[1:25:24] rightfully his debt and took it into
[1:25:26] himself by grace and grace is still here
[1:25:30] this morning I believe that Mercy still
[1:25:32] on the seat this morning I believe it's
[1:25:34] getting close to the hour where Grace
[1:25:36] will will will rise off of its seat and
[1:25:38] come down in power I believe we're at
[1:25:40] that age I believe we're at that corner
[1:25:42] but for this morning there's still time
[1:25:45] for this morning the winds are still
[1:25:47] being held back there's still time to
[1:25:49] get into the dispensation of Grace now
[1:25:52] churches have tried law law law law and
[1:25:55] none of them succeeded but we are under
[1:25:57] a different Commission in this age where
[1:26:00] Elijah was the law Elijah came down in
[1:26:03] our age and preached to us but there was
[1:26:05] a two-fold purpose of this ministry for
[1:26:08] he was also
[1:26:10] zerubba and zerubbabel's message to the
[1:26:12] church was Grace Grace Grace Grace to
[1:26:17] the church now which side do we want to
[1:26:19] be on a church choosing law or Grace do
[1:26:24] we want the law or we want the grace if
[1:26:27] you were Daniel Curry would you say no
[1:26:29] keep the law or would you turn to the
[1:26:31] voice of
[1:26:32] Grace how could we then expect everybody
[1:26:35] else to follow the law and us not give
[1:26:37] them Grace when we are Desiring the
[1:26:39] voice of Grace in our
[1:26:42] life but Grace is
[1:26:44] given and Grace is received right a
[1:26:47] pardon is not a pardon unless it's
[1:26:49] received as a pardon now Grace is here
[1:26:50] this morning but it's got to be received
[1:26:52] as Grace I canot not psychologically
[1:26:55] talk you out of a of a situation and
[1:26:57] make you Victorious but when you receive
[1:26:59] Grace you realize there's nothing I
[1:27:01] could have done anyway if it wasn't this
[1:27:04] trial it would have been another one if
[1:27:06] it wasn't this mistake it would have
[1:27:07] been another mistake but Grace has come
[1:27:09] down in this age to cover it lay it upon
[1:27:14] me because something had to be heavy
[1:27:17] enough to descend down to where Lucifer
[1:27:20] fell and there on the cross we could dip
[1:27:22] into Psalms 22 for a moment right and
[1:27:25] there he's on the cross and he's he he's
[1:27:27] going through the suffering David is
[1:27:28] entering to the suffering where Christ
[1:27:30] would enter in on the cross and he's
[1:27:31] saying my bones they stare at
[1:27:34] me what did that to
[1:27:36] him
[1:27:41] Grace I can count my
[1:27:45] bones my tongue it Cleaves to my
[1:27:49] mouth
[1:27:52] father why is that forsaken
[1:27:56] me but he didn't forsake Him He was
[1:27:59] fulfilling Grace because somebody had to
[1:28:03] pick up all of those sins amen something
[1:28:07] had to be heavy enough to descend down
[1:28:09] to where sin itself resided where it had
[1:28:12] the keys to your
[1:28:13] Victory and through Grace he descended
[1:28:16] down Into the Depths and when he cries
[1:28:18] out it is
[1:28:19] finished because one day some someone a
[1:28:24] bride member is going to sin for the
[1:28:26] last time and that vision of Jesus over
[1:28:28] the world and where that fog is over the
[1:28:30] world somebody's going to sin for the
[1:28:32] last time and when he reaches out in
[1:28:34] that Dimension and takes it into himself
[1:28:36] he's going to cry it is finished Grace
[1:28:38] is complete the work is complete it's
[1:28:41] finished it's
[1:28:43] finished God and then as a breath
[1:28:46] brother B says all of the sin from Adam
[1:28:49] on down fell upon his shoulders that
[1:28:51] includes you and I all of the sin from
[1:28:53] Adam on down fell upon his
[1:28:57] shoulders it's
[1:28:59] finished and he descends down into the
[1:29:01] depths of
[1:29:05] hell as he walks through the corridors
[1:29:07] of Hell there's there's an anxiety demon
[1:29:11] he's here I met him before he's walking
[1:29:15] he's walking down the hallway there's
[1:29:18] cancer cowering in the corner he's here
[1:29:21] why because he's not walking down he's
[1:29:22] in his glorified body now he's in his
[1:29:24] the theophonic body now walking down
[1:29:27] those corridors with light emitting and
[1:29:29] wherever light is Darkness cannot stand
[1:29:32] and those demon Spirits began to tremble
[1:29:34] for fear because even they recognized
[1:29:37] he's here how much more we the Church of
[1:29:39] the Living God ought to recognize who is
[1:29:41] here and as he walks down those
[1:29:43] corridors of hell with all of those
[1:29:45] demon and tormentors and fears and
[1:29:47] frustrations and sicknesses and he's on
[1:29:50] his way to the chief door Hallelujah and
[1:29:53] they begin to Tri into fear and Satan
[1:29:55] can feel his presence coming since he's
[1:29:56] here and tries to throw all the locks in
[1:29:59] the
[1:30:02] door says all one Satan hears a knock at
[1:30:04] the
[1:30:07] door open
[1:30:10] up he has to obey him supreme
[1:30:15] authority opens the door I finally got
[1:30:19] you you see what a liar of Satan is he
[1:30:21] knew he was defeated but he tries to
[1:30:23] Bluff you
[1:30:25] I finally got you I finally got I
[1:30:27] thought I I had you when I got Ezekiel I
[1:30:29] thought I had you when I got Abel I
[1:30:31] thought I had you when I when I you
[1:30:34] see he
[1:30:37] thought but now he was face to face with
[1:30:39] the real one and the real one said give
[1:30:42] me the keys give me those keys and say
[1:30:45] wait wait a minute wait a
[1:30:47] minute I'm
[1:30:50] old I'm old you took the you took the
[1:30:54] the tab for a lot of people I'm old see
[1:30:56] all these sins see all of these sins
[1:30:59] here is a flip to his book let's let's
[1:31:01] turn to let's turn to Mary
[1:31:03] Magdalene oh see see all these
[1:31:08] sins let's turn to
[1:31:14] Luther let's turn to
[1:31:16] Gideon
[1:31:18] amen see all these sins these are old
[1:31:21] and Jesus confidently realizing the time
[1:31:23] time and place that he's in and and
[1:31:25] brother bam types it this way his blood
[1:31:27] was still dripping wet on the cross and
[1:31:29] Jesus said I am the sinless perfect Son
[1:31:31] of God and my blood is still wet on the
[1:31:33] cross of Calvary and I see it like this
[1:31:35] in my mind's eye that blood had had
[1:31:37] worked its way down through the cavities
[1:31:40] of Earth and down through the rocks and
[1:31:41] the M of the world and there they're
[1:31:44] having that conversation in the depths
[1:31:45] of hell and that perfect sinless blood
[1:31:48] of Christ Falls and washes away the
[1:31:50] devil's book of great sin and he can't
[1:31:53] make it's not legible anymore he doesn't
[1:31:56] even know your name he doesn't have a
[1:31:59] record of you anymore why because the
[1:32:01] blood of Christ came in atone for you
[1:32:04] that you would not carry the
[1:32:06] debt but it's been
[1:32:08] paid the Deb's been settled Hallelujah
[1:32:12] that blood of Christ came down and
[1:32:13] washed away everything that you have
[1:32:15] accounted in this life and the only
[1:32:18] thing determining whether it's for you
[1:32:20] or not is acceptance of the blood to say
[1:32:22] thy Grace is sufficient
[1:32:26] Lord what a God rich in Mercy oh but you
[1:32:29] don't know how long my list is but he's
[1:32:31] exceedingly rich in Grace brother Caleb
[1:32:34] it does not matter how long the list
[1:32:39] is Satan has no record of
[1:32:43] you why because you're under the blood
[1:32:46] and as long as you're under this token
[1:32:48] of the blood Satan cannot find you so
[1:32:51] that means there are places that we can
[1:32:53] go in this word where the devil cannot
[1:32:55] follow us there are places that we can
[1:32:58] go in this anointing where the devil
[1:33:00] cannot chase us and we think we've got
[1:33:02] to put up with this Tormentor our life
[1:33:03] no we don't there's a place within the
[1:33:06] word of God that we can find
[1:33:09] peace there's a place that we can go
[1:33:12] into where the devil cannot follow us
[1:33:14] why because he doesn't have the
[1:33:18] keys and as that blood washed away his
[1:33:20] book he said give me those keys those
[1:33:23] are my keys that Adam lost they were
[1:33:25] mine all along and I have come down to
[1:33:28] redeem back my
[1:33:30] bride that she could go through the
[1:33:32] doors that Adam walked through that she
[1:33:34] could be in the victory that Adam was
[1:33:36] in here's the keys
[1:33:39] friends brother B you can find this
[1:33:41] Mighty conqueror in the Rapture 65 and
[1:33:43] he turns down some corridors and begins
[1:33:45] to knock on some other
[1:33:47] doors and he preaches to those Souls
[1:33:49] that were
[1:33:50] lost why didn't you believe Enoch why
[1:33:53] didn't you believe Noah why didn't you
[1:33:56] believe William brandom why didn't you
[1:33:58] believe the message that I sent to you
[1:33:59] in your dispensation and in your time
[1:34:01] why didn't you believe Elijah why didn't
[1:34:03] you believe Elisha and began to preach
[1:34:05] to those Souls that were lost they were
[1:34:07] coming testifying of me why didn't you
[1:34:10] believe
[1:34:12] them and then he turns another
[1:34:16] Corner a knock at the door brother Bram
[1:34:19] says this is mighty conqueror brother
[1:34:21] Ram says there there's all
[1:34:25] job coming to the

[1:35:30] resurrect the Saints and there he tells
[1:35:33] him of what's going on in the progress
[1:35:35] of the plan of God and about that time
[1:35:37] he pulls out his keys you're rides here
[1:35:41] your rides here Saints your rides here
[1:35:44] and the Bible says that those that slept
[1:35:46] in Christ resurrected with him
[1:35:49] resurrected with him on the third day
[1:35:51] and began to walk amongst those a
[1:35:53] tangible
[1:35:54] and fellowship with those back in the
[1:35:57] world and Abraham said remember that was
[1:35:59] the well that was our that was our son

[1:36:12] all of the things of their past life but
[1:36:14] then when Jesus was done doing what he
[1:36:16] was doing there with the disciples said

[1:38:54] and he said I heard as it were a lion
[1:38:56] roaring behind me and I turned to look
[1:38:59] and it wasn't a lion but it was a lamb
[1:39:01] it was the sinless sacrifice of God that
[1:39:04] said there he is Behold the Lamb that
[1:39:08] taketh away the sin of the world yes
[1:39:10] that includes your sin and you are John
[1:39:13] and you are witnessing this take place
[1:39:15] in your life to say I can go free I
[1:39:18] don't have to carry this anymore but I'm
[1:39:20] free and he with a son has made free is
[1:39:23] free indeed we don't have to be under
[1:39:26] tradition of what man says but God has
[1:39:29] said you're free God has said you're
[1:39:32] free young man God has said you're free
[1:39:34] you're free from addiction you're free
[1:39:36] from from Pain you're pre free from
[1:39:39] sorrow not a words of a man but God has
[1:39:41] said you're free God has told you you
[1:39:44] can go free and all you've got to do is
[1:39:46] walk through the
[1:39:49] door where is this door for two 2,000
[1:39:53] years man could not find this door but
[1:39:56] in our age and in our time a doorway
[1:40:04] opened there Sarah was up in age about a
[1:40:07] 100
[1:40:08] years I'm never going to have a child
[1:40:11] I'm never going to produce what this
[1:40:12] word
[1:40:13] says I'm never going to bring forth
[1:40:16] life but all of a sudden there's a knock
[1:40:18] at the tent
[1:40:19] door and she has her first interaction
[1:40:22] with mzc
[1:40:27] something happened to Sarah she began to
[1:40:32] change she was even in the middle of
[1:40:35] doubt and she began to change why did
[1:40:38] Sarah laugh at me she still began to
[1:40:41] change why because you cannot stop
[1:40:44] prophetic Vision you cannot stop elected
[1:40:47] seed you cannot stop the perfect plan of
[1:40:50] God no matter what we think or what we
[1:40:52] have idea about you cannot stop this the
[1:40:55] devil cannot stop
[1:40:57] this can I just preach for a minute the
[1:41:00] devil had plans for your life oh yeah
[1:41:02] the devil had plans for each one of you
[1:41:03] he knew where you were going to be and
[1:41:05] what you were going to turn out to be
[1:41:06] and he had all these array plans of how
[1:41:08] you would not be successful yeah amen
[1:41:12] but God canel the devil's
[1:41:14] plans God canceled the devil's plans for
[1:41:17] your life and he said you might have
[1:41:19] this in store for them but I have seen
[1:41:20] them I have called them I have Ed them
[1:41:23] and I will not lose them from my GP I
[1:41:26] will not lose them they will be returned
[1:41:28] back to Eternity with
[1:41:30] me what the devil had planned for you
[1:41:33] God's word is more powerful God's word
[1:41:37] is supreme authority God's word has the
[1:41:39] final say I choose to take God's word
[1:41:42] over my life than what the devil would
[1:41:43] say about me the devil would say you're
[1:41:45] nothing you're never going to make it
[1:41:46] you might as well give up but God said I
[1:41:48] have seen you and elected you and my
[1:41:51] grace is sufficient for you why don't we
[1:41:53] say What God Says About
[1:41:57] Us listen to the devil and what are we
[1:41:59] going to end up we're going to end up in
[1:42:01] depression we're going to end up in hell
[1:42:03] we're going to end up in despair CU
[1:42:05] that's all he knows how to
[1:42:09] preach the law the law the law the
[1:42:14] law but our message is
[1:42:19] Grace brother Caleb when I hear the
[1:42:21] prophet's voice I don't hear law
[1:42:24] amen when I put that on just I'm my wife
[1:42:27] my wife says she she can't do it she
[1:42:29] starts listening to the tape and can't
[1:42:30] fall asleep but man when I'm ready to go
[1:42:31] to sleep I put on a tape there's nothing
[1:42:33] more soothing for
[1:42:36] me good evening
[1:42:40] friends it's Grace to
[1:42:43] me so our pastor brother Wayne which
[1:42:45] sends his greetings by the way he's he

[1:42:48] forward there's only 20 minutes left and
[1:42:51] I fall asleep right away and she listens
[1:42:52] to a lot of prayer lines

[1:42:59] be lot to somebody else is Grace to you
[1:43:02] because you recognize what side you're
[1:43:04] on yeah you made mistakes but Grace was
[1:43:07] there yeah you fallen short but Grace
[1:43:09] was there yeah there's probably
[1:43:10] decisions that you would go back and
[1:43:11] change but Grace was there and he worked
[1:43:14] all things for your good you know why
[1:43:16] because your footsteps are ordered of
[1:43:18] the
[1:43:21] Lord I wish I had more time but I'm
[1:43:23] going to try to I'm going to try to
[1:43:24] Coast down
[1:43:26] here why would we let man's Doctrine
[1:43:28] dictate to us how we
[1:43:31] believe I think we're past those days I
[1:43:34] believe the Church of God has past the
[1:43:36] days where we're concerned about whose
[1:43:37] Doctrine and this Doctrine and that
[1:43:38] Doctrine I say let's believe the message
[1:43:41] as the message was preached and the
[1:43:42] message did not come to tell you you
[1:43:44] weren't going to make it why would God
[1:43:46] send a man and vindicate him to tell you
[1:43:48] Caleb you can't make it why would God do
[1:43:50] that but God Vindicated a message in
[1:43:52] this day to tell you've already made it
[1:43:55] you've already overcome I have made a
[1:43:57] way for you when there was no way I made
[1:44:00] a way when you couldn't see your way out
[1:44:02] of it I brought you out of it when you
[1:44:04] could not see the light I turn on the
[1:44:07] light for you he is working all things
[1:44:10] to our good there is nothing no power no
[1:44:14] sin no sickness not hell not the grave
[1:44:17] and nothing can separate
[1:44:19] us not one thing can separate us from
[1:44:22] the Love Of
[1:44:24] Christ amen you think your sin's too
[1:44:27] great oh well you don't know what I've
[1:44:28] done nothing amen can separate
[1:44:31] us I hope you understand I'm not
[1:44:33] preaching disgrace I think if there was
[1:44:35] ever a time to get back to Holiness it's
[1:44:36] right now if there was ever a time to
[1:44:38] die out to the world it's right now if
[1:44:41] there was ever a time to get rid of all
[1:44:43] of the dross of the world and all the
[1:44:45] thing I don't care what you have to do
[1:44:46] get rid of it if you got to get off
[1:44:49] social media get off of it if you got to
[1:44:52] stop to talking that friend stop talking
[1:44:54] to that
[1:44:56] friend it's Father's Day can I preach to

[1:45:14] them this is not a time to get LAX and
[1:45:17] give place to the devil this is the time
[1:45:19] to stand up for the message and be not
[1:45:21] ashamed
[1:45:24] it'd be easy for me to P press play here
[1:45:26] and let the prophet tell you not to not
[1:45:29] to you know wear pants and cut your hair
[1:45:31] and wear makeup that would be easy for
[1:45:32] me to let him tell you to do that or you
[1:45:34] men to live lives above reproach that'
[1:45:35] be easy for me to let the prophet do
[1:45:37] that it'd be an easy Ministry for me to
[1:45:39] press play but I choose to stand Toe to
[1:45:42] Toe I choose to let my voice also ring
[1:45:45] out with the prophet's voice and say
[1:45:47] come out of her my people and be not
[1:45:50] partakers of her come out of that
[1:45:54] yeah we should not blend in we should
[1:45:57] not want to blend in with Leo deia the
[1:45:59] pressure of this age is that we have to
[1:46:00] accept everybody I do not accept
[1:46:02] everybody I do not accept a demon
[1:46:04] anointing in my home that would Rob my
[1:46:07] children from a victory that would Rob
[1:46:09] my children from happiness or joy amen I
[1:46:12] do not accept
[1:46:13] that God here a few weeks ago my wife
[1:46:17] had a growth on her thyroid they told
[1:46:18] her it was probably cancerous and did
[1:46:20] all kinds of blood tests and screens she
[1:46:21] did not accept that

[1:46:25] tells you he went through a prayer line
[1:46:28] at our church just a couple weeks ago
[1:46:29] and in an instant that that goer was
[1:46:32] healed I don't care whether it was
[1:46:34] cancer whether it was not God healed
[1:46:37] it you don't have to accept what the
[1:46:39] devil gives you God is not a god of
[1:46:42] yesterday he's a god of today yes sir

[1:49:01] you live what age are we living
[1:49:04] in it's a Rapture age you better be able
[1:49:07] to jump high you better be able to get
[1:49:09] off the ground you better be able to
[1:49:11] slip into an anointing where it's not
[1:49:13] you and your works but Grace has taken
[1:49:15] over and you say not by might not by
[1:49:18] power but by your spirit says the Lord
[1:49:21] yes sir it's Grace to the church hallah
[1:49:24] who put who put the law of the Sun and
[1:49:27] and gravity and and let there be right
[1:49:29] and all of these Planet putting in in
[1:49:31] orbit science can't even figure it out
[1:49:33] today who did all that well it have to
[1:49:36] be
[1:49:38] God
[1:49:41] Sarah the door is here just go ahead and
[1:49:44] leave leave that up brother leave that
[1:49:45] up thank you amen the door is
[1:49:49] here who put who put who put the sun in
[1:49:52] or
[1:49:53] well God did right
[1:49:56] yeah well there's nothing greater than
[1:49:58] the law of God it was God's law that put
[1:50:01] put you know put the the sun if the if
[1:50:03] the Earth was just a couple degrees off
[1:50:04] we'd melt and a couple degrees off the
[1:50:06] other way we'd freeze well they had have
[1:50:08] been a law to keep that in orbit right
[1:50:12] who made that law
[1:50:17] god well nothing's greater than the law
[1:50:19] of God oh really what about when Jos
[1:50:23] josua I don't have time to preach on
[1:50:25] this but Joshua was fighting a battle
[1:50:27] for somebody else go back and read it he
[1:50:29] wasn't fighting his own battle he was
[1:50:31] fighting a battle that he committed to
[1:50:32] help a brother even though that brother
[1:50:34] lied to him he still went into battle
[1:50:37] for that brother for the sake of
[1:50:38] Jehovah's name and said we've got to win
[1:50:40] this battle so I could preach a lot on
[1:50:42] that but but Brotherly Love still in
[1:50:44] full
[1:50:45] effect amen and so Joshua was in the
[1:50:47] middle of this battle he's saying we
[1:50:48] can't lose Lord your name's on the line
[1:50:50] you promised us that we would win this
[1:50:52] battle and no giant standing before us
[1:50:54] would conquer us and it would be today
[1:50:58] amen so what gave Joshua the authority
[1:51:01] to tell the son to stand
[1:51:03] still Grace brother the B says it was
[1:51:06] the grace of God that came down and
[1:51:08] inspired Joshua to say son stand still
[1:51:12] and so the grace that Joshua poured out
[1:51:15] was greater than the law of the
[1:51:19] son amen we together yes
[1:51:23] wow who made the law of gravity amen
[1:51:26] well only a deity powerful enough as God
[1:51:28] would have to do that a gravity just
[1:51:31] just find out just try to jump off that
[1:51:33] chair gravity is in full effect gravity
[1:51:36] is amongst us God made that law
[1:51:38] nothing's greater than the law of God oh
[1:51:41] really what about when Enoch was walking
[1:51:44] with
[1:51:46] God and their conversation got greater
[1:51:50] than the effect of the law
[1:51:53] amen are we together their conversation
[1:51:56] got greater than the law of gravity and
[1:51:59] Enoch
[1:52:01] lifted what about
[1:52:04] Phillip when philli was doing a duty for
[1:52:06] the Lord and went to baptize somebody
[1:52:08] but he was late for a preaching
[1:52:10] commission but sometimes I wish I could
[1:52:12] travel like a thought like
[1:52:14] thaten what was it philli was
[1:52:17] translated right this is acts 8 maybe
[1:52:20] Philip was translated
[1:52:24] who did that Grace amen when the who
[1:52:28] wrote who wrote the Ten Commandments God
[1:52:31] did but when he said your sins which
[1:52:34] were many they were all based off those
[1:52:36] Commandments and when he said they're
[1:52:38] all forgiven oh that's good what's
[1:52:41] greater than the law of God then amen my
[1:52:45] grace is sufficient for
[1:52:49] thee God
[1:52:53] if it was based on our
[1:52:54] works how long of a of a lawless list
[1:52:58] would we
[1:52:59] have breaking offense after offense
[1:53:01] after offense transgressors against the
[1:53:05] law and if we're to be judged by the law
[1:53:08] not one of us will make it not one of us
[1:53:11] will see it over there but thank God
[1:53:13] we're not judged by the law thank God
[1:53:16] there's something greater than the law
[1:53:20] it's the grace of God and this Grace has
[1:53:23] come down in our age and I don't know
[1:53:24] friends I I I hope this brother Jason
[1:53:26] can correct me for the church when when
[1:53:28] he gets back but that's what I see when

[1:53:32] age I see the face of Christ coming down
[1:53:35] and looking upon us with Grace saying

[1:54:26] kingdom when John turned to see in
[1:54:28] Revelations 5 and he said I saw my name
[1:54:32] the same blood had wrote his name across
[1:54:34] the Lamb's Book of
[1:54:36] Life and the blood of that lamb cannot
[1:54:39] be erased it cannot be
[1:54:42] removed prise God but it's the
[1:54:45] blood
