at the very end of time amen you know brother brand said it like this he said we're living in a very uh terrible time he said but it's a terrible time for the unbeliever he said but it's a glorious time for the believer and I I'm glad to be a believer amen amen Genesis chapter 1 and verse one amen as we would start these meetings out you always want to start out on the right foot and so we just been asking the Lord to direct us today and just couldn't get away from this thought so Genesis 1 and verse one in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day amen we let you be seated today uh just like to uh speak to you this evening on the spirit of God moved let there be light amen we we um very firmly believe that this world that we're living in wasn't caused by just uh two little particles coming together somehow and meeting together in the space of nothingness and meeting together and it became a a big boom as we know the uh big boom Theory or whatever they have Big Bang Theory but I believe it was a bang I believe it was the word of God that said let there be light and light was formed but as we look reading our scripture there was something that began to take place before all of this took place and that was uh is there just yeah let me give it to you there was a there was a something that be to take place before the spirit before God spoke and that was the spirit of God moved and you know in this world that live in today is a beautiful place we been enjoying some of the beauty here in South Carolina and the beautiful sunsets and things we witnessed but there was a time that it was a formless uh world it was a place of confusion it was a a nothingness an empty space it was Unreal the Wasteland and the Wilderness it was a place of chaos it was it was to be vo it was a void in Wasteland void means to be emptied unfulfilled or desolate or are bearen and this is the world that we're living in and this and there was a time when this world was laying in complete darkness and it was without form and was void and it was all covered with water and laying there in that dark dim dismal gloomy atmosphere but laying in this condition the Bible says the spirit of God be to move and when the spirit of God be to move the word was spoke and the Dynamics was there to bring it to pass the spirit of God proved in that moment that it was greater than the darkness that covered the Earth it was greater than the Gloom it was greater than the coldness it was it was greater than the nothingness was there the light be to Dawn upon the Earth and no doubt you know the Gloom and the coldness and the Darkness and and it all tried to hold its position it tried to keep its place but it could not because the spirit of God was greater than the Gloom it was greater than the darkness amen you know this morning when you got up and you looked and the sun begin to rise or maybe was already up it was the spoken word of God and it's still hanging there today not one of us got up this morning and worried about whether it was going to come up or whether it was going to be there you felt this warm raise you felt it bathe over you you know as you went through this little cold snap it felt good right and and it stands but it's standing there is a sign every morning it rises it defies darkness and it pushes it back to where it belongs and light comes forth proven again every day that light is greater than Darkness amen the sun is a sign that the spirit of God is still greater than any darkness that tries to hold a child of God it's greater than any coldness it's greater than any lukewarmness it's greater than any Gloom any emptiness the is greater than any Spirit of the enemy amen if you can let the spirit of God begin to move the light of God will shine amen there will be births take place there will be changes of Hearts there will be lives that are turned around when the spirit of God moves amen you know it's not you know I I know we we want the word and the word has to have preeminence but it's more than just having the word you got to have the spirit that makes the word live amen it's the spirit that brings the word to pass amen you know brother Brandon would say it like this he would say I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God moving amen I I'm I'm I feel that way tonight too I I just can't hardly stand it he said some experiences I've had in the mountains he said just to feel that once again that something that when I first was saved it was so glorious in my heart and we can come to that place we can sit and see Among Us that we drying out you know he said we're in a desert he was out there in Tucson and he said I get among my brother and they talk to me and I talk with him and it's a way of watching feeling as the spirit begins to move just to see the condition of that brother to see what's wrong andbe said but I feel us all reclining and getting away from the spirit it's become too natural a thing for us he said but we must Worship in the spirit amen we must live in the spirit not only our message should be the flame of the hour but it should also be the flame of our hearts amen it's got to be in our hearts or we can't rightly represent it to the people he said but the spirit has to pack the message itself amen amen so it's not just word word word but it's the spirit of God that we got to have in our churches we got to have in our worship we got to have in our lives so that the word might live because we know the word alone is nothing but a dead letter amen he said tonight you know in another place he said tonight maybe a cancer has conquered you or maybe something's got a hold of you some disease even the disease of sin whatever it is it may look ever so dark and gloomy to you now it may look like you'll never recover it may look like you can't get over that t or that prostate trouble or lung trouble or whatever it is that tumor that condition the mo the doctor May say every hope is gone but standing right by your side ready to take you in possession stands the eyes of faith that sees the victory through the Lord Jesus Christ so away with Satan and his Gloom amen can we say that tonight away with Satan and his Glo Up with the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ the faith of almighty God a faith that can stand upon the Rock of Ages and Pierce The Eagle Eye through every stormy Cloud every wave and every disappointment that tries to wash the foundation it'll stand there and look beyond that and say God Is Right amen no matter what the doctor says God is right no matter what science says God is right no matter what your symptoms say God is right no matter what you feel tonight God Is Right Hallelujah so away with Satan and his gloom and up with the faith of the Lord amen tonight we can still say God Is Right amen he said let there be light and that sun is still hanging there today you didn't get up this morning and worry about it and Fred about it you knew by faith that son is coming up God spoke it and it's going to happen Hallelujah we can have the same confidence that the same God that spoke the son into existence and is still hanging there to find Darkness he's the same God that said I'll heal all thy diseases hallelujah it's going to happen he said I will deliver you it's going to happen we can have the same confidence amen that he said that the Sun as it defies the darkness and the Gloom the word of God is here tonight and the spirit of God is here to back it up to defy every devil amen defy every sickness to defy every dep depression to defy every anxiety Spirit to defy fear itself amen the spirit of God is here to defy it tonight all right cuz the Sun is up amen the spirit of God is here moving to bring the word to pass let there be light amen faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen amen the very faith that little whip that you have standing another quote that you have standing by you if you only let it take you into possession take you and believe and have faith and believe that God's word is true I accept it then faith will work a miracle for you God's word has said this which is the infallible word these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils or evil spirits and speak with new tongues or take up serpents or amen that's our commission right right amen drink deadly things or would harm them if they lay hands upon the sick they shall recover God's word says that there's something trying to work in your heart tonight that says that's the truth but does it mean me amen it means whosoever will let him come it means you Hallelujah and the spirit of God moved something that was void you say sometimes I feel so empty let the spirit of God begin to move sometimes I feel so depressed let the spirit of God begin to move I feel so s far away from him let the spirit of God move I say let him move in our hearts let him move in our lives let him move in our families let him move in our marriages let him move in our churches take the shackles off of him and let him [Applause] go let him move the spirit of God let him fall down like rain that's been my prayer for this weekend let the spirit of God fall like down like rain not a little drip drop but a gusher of the Holy Ghost amen you know brother B talked about the people that artist that had painted a picture of the rock that followed them and that little trickle that came out of that rock he said that was about the funniest thing I ever seen he said that wasn't no little trickle that fed that watered two million people and all their animals no it was a gusher neither is this Holy Ghost a little trickle but it's a fountain an inexhaustible Fountain of Life amen it's free whosoever will let him come and drink the spirit of God moved upon the waters and the word spoken let there be light so they both moved together amen God had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there were seeds he had there amen he had to have the sunlight to make it live Colossians 1:12 says giving thanks unto the Father which has made us to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints and light who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated Us in the Kingdom of his dear son and whom we have Redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin so down beyond all that darkness and all that Gloom and all that un all that nothingness laid seeds down there laid life that he was or something that was ordained to life and so there had to be something that could pull upon it and bring it out Hallelujah so he said the spirit of God begin to go over the face of the waters and begin to woo and begin to call and begin to move and a word spoke and said let there be life cuz down there was a seed down there was a life that was ordained Amen to come to fruition and I I remember the time when I was also down in sin and also also Darkness was all around me but the spirit of God begin to woo and it begin to pull up and it begin to move let me tell you when there spirit of God begins to move there ain't enough sin there ain't enough doubt there ain't enough unbelief there ain't enough darkness that can cover a seed of God and keep it from coming [Applause] up Hallelujah the first light that was ever given in the Earth was God's spoken word the first light that ever struck the Earth was God's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turned Darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the Earth then the spirit of God as it moved with love and compassion at that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the Earth the Sun Rose and it swept across his ways and it dried up the waters from the earth and made an atmosphere above and for the first time it was to bring joy and life to the Earth by seed that was a great hour that word was with the world was without form it was void dark dark Ness was on the earth nothing but complete chaos and when the world was in that condition the spirit of God moved upon the face of the world it changed the whole picture of the world it went from Total Chaos to a Garden of Eden it was the word that brought a transforming power of God and the spirit was there to bring it to pass it takes the moving of the spirit to bring seeds to life amen that's why we can't stand for some cold formal dead religion amen or some doctr that's cut off the spirit of God we must have the moving of the spirit in our church amen we must because it's a spirit that quickens the word it's a spirit that quickens the seed amen or otherwise it just sits there in dead formal conditions but if you'll let the spirit begin to move and begin to woo over it and begin to call it it'll call it out of that dead formalism it'll call it out of that sin I've seen it as it begin to move in the service and there begin to woo on the heart and it begin to pull them out of their sin out of their doubts out of their [Applause] fear he's that kind of God he knows how to woo Hallelujah he knows how to bring those out I believe we're in the time the prodal coming home all right thank God anybody else believe that I I believe that I believe we're at the time prodal are going to return that's why I believe you ought to do a church renovation and build a bigger place you're going to need it amen because prodical are going to come home all right amen I I believe it I I believe we keep the spirit of God moving and the life of God moving it's going to happen it's going to take place God knows how to get them where he has to God knows where to bring them to where they need to be God knows how to woo them I don't care if they're in a barro or they out there in the street somewhere God knows how to bring his children home it doesn't matter how dark they are what a problem I was just at uh this at the beginning of this year was at brother Kelly Hilder Branch ministering and I just dropped this in here I was there for Friday Saturday and Sunday and and the first service Friday night and I was again you're just laboring wanting to find the right direction you know Hey listen a preacher always got something to preach but you want to preach the right thing for the right moment and so I I was just calling out to the Lord there in the hotel room and sister Ruth sister Katie was out shopping with the sister and and so I I I just was looking around come across that that thought on on on on who touched me and as I begin to look at this woman as she touched the Hem of His Garment I it was like the light the room lit up and I I thought well here this is the right place and I just went diving into that got up there that night and begin to preach and I was preaching on who touched me and how how her her sin her blood issue had actually contaminated her where she couldn't come in her father's house and anybody got around her but God was willing to take on her contamination wow he was willing to take her sins and take her unworthiness and make her clean yeah and I'm preaching that and I didn't know out in the audience was a young man who who had left the church as a young boy he's now he's in his 30s now but he was like around 12 years old and his family had left and and he had been out in the world and he' married a girl out in the world and and and she had they had been married I don't know a couple of years and they they they found out she'd been diagnosed with Ms or the doctors think she is it's a devastating diagnosis and and he's like well I I don't know what to do he said I I I can't I but he said I know I know where God is yes amen and he said I if you want to go I'll take you to where he's at he said because the doctors can't do nothing about this but my God the God can I know he can I've left him a long time ago and he's telling all this and he and his testimony later as he be to tell me he said that that night I went as I got so desperate before God and he said Lord I I want to go to these meetings and and he said I want to I I don't want to just go out of fear or what may happen to my wife he said I know I've left you a long time ago he said but if I could just Touch the Hem of your garments if I could just touch you and I would be M my I would be made whole for my sin and my wife could be healed if I could just get to you listen God knows how to woo he knows how to pull he knows how to touch he knows how to annoint he knows how to do it all we just have to give him the freedom and allow him to do what he does am it's a spirit that quickens the word it's possible but you know it's be said brother B said it like this this is interesting he said it's possible you can be sitting here every one of us has got the same five senses right amen some of us may like one of this I actually like sometimes a sense of smell sometimes that's a good thing sometimes not so much but anyway he said there might be somebody here's got a headache and you can't hardly sit still and he said I don't have a headache but how do I know about your headache it's something dealing individually with you and he said that's how the spirit of God can come down in a group of people and can baptize that person in such a way that the power of God carries them to where they don't even know where they're standing no more and the next person sitting around them know nothing about it amen we cried Lord we've been talking about Lord moving our church that's good but what we need to say is spirit of God moving me Quicken me you you can have a move in the spirit of the church but did the spirit move in your seat did it move in your heart did it move in your life did it move in your family amen it's so easy wow we had a good service but was it a good service for you Amen to God come and move in your life and change your life that's what we need I don't care if you've been serving God for 50 years you could always have more of God we should never get to the point that we've had enough and we've we've attained it all and we've got it all listen we don't have it all he's an inexhaustible Fountain you can't ever have too much of God Amen if you had him yesterday get more today if you had him last week get more this [Applause] week I don't want to ever get in the condition though that the spirit of God is fallen and I don't know it God make us cognant of your presence he comes every service but sometimes he gets by us before we realize it and he's come and gone wow amen how many others were there but didn't catch the significance of his presence when that woman with a bloody shoe was was so urgently going towards him and it was her whole focus it was her whole everything it was what she had to do that listen she didn't remember she didn't care if there was a pot of beans on the stove no more she didn't care what was happening tomorrow what was happening or what had happened this week I just have to get to Jesus come on now can we have that same attitude this whole weekend I need to get not just this whole weekend every service every day I just want to get to Jesus and when I get to him I want to fall down at his feet and I want to touch the H of His Garment and allow him to work in my [Applause] life how many others were there but they didn't catch the significance of his presence amen there was a woman with a blood issue who wouldn't let him get by without touching His Garment some thought it was just a lot of work to emotion yeah come on come on now some thought he just made up a story some thought listen he was actually on his way to gyrus his house and his mind was to go somewhere else but she made it her opportunity she wasn't going to allow him to get by her he may have he may have he may have Taylor Made this sermon for somebody but that doesn't mean you can't get what you need amen if you'll just reach him when he comes by and say God you're not getting by me tonight you're not getting by me this service I have a need [Applause] Hallelujah well a lot of them no doubt say well that that Jesus he knows how to work up a crowd I tell you gets a woman in such a frenzy she falls down and grab but you know what they wern't the one that had the need you know it was a man that was prayed for in brother Brandon's meeting I maybe not get all the details exactly right he was in a wheelchair and he's told he was healed said just go testify and he started testifying thank God I'm Healed still in the wheelchair and his and his people of his church and different ones ministers come I think and different ones come and come and started saying look you're making a fool of yourself you're making a fool of God you're making you know listen you never make a fool of God by saying what he said [Applause] am amen God will back up what he said and he looked at them and he said mister if you was sitting where I'm sitting all right if you were sitting where I was I'm sitting you wouldn't take the only hope away from me that I got and he said in the name of Jesus I'm Healed right and right there he rose out of his seat Hallelujah maybe others don't understand why we act like we well you ain't sitting where I'm sitting you ain't going through what I'm going through you ain't dealing with what I'm dealing with amen if you would know what I've dealt with he wouldn't take the hope I got away from me but I'm going to confess the word of God by his stripes I'm [Applause] heal my son's coming home my daughter's being delivered whatever it is the doctor one time said to brother Brandon Billy don't don't you think them people them Pentecostal people just excited he said no sir I don't he said that's nervousness that causes they screaming holl said Doctor you mean to tell me that nerves can be excited without something to excite them something has to excite them he said so what's there what is it he said it's the Unseen force of the holy ghost moving Among Us it excites that Born Again Spirit wow wow it brings an excitement into that Spirit the power of God Foams down through there faith comes through by here the Holy Ghost takes the word the Holy Ghost the spirit takes the word spreads it out over the people to catch it with a power that regenerated Born Again life something has to cry out amen he said Joel seen the day when that would be changed when they had adopted said God help when we come and adopted theology instead of the baptism of the Holy Ghost my goodness ouch God helped the day when you take away tiing from the church and boil up some old tough rooster and sell her for 50 cents a plate to pay the preacher it's a shame God helped the day when we substituted the upper room for a supper room God helped today what we need is a good oldfashioned St Paul Revival in the Bible Holy Ghost preached again in power and simplicity yeah what did Paul preach well he said he preached things like this who also hath made us able Ministers of a new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life amen Amen on down in that he says now the spir Lord is that spirit and when the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty glory amen hallelujah there is Liberty he said not long ago brother brandom somebody said brother brandham preach the gospel he said very noted evangelist a friend we belong to the same church he said brother Brandon while you're on the west coast preach the gospel I said I do doctor he said not that Divine Healing preach the word the word is what I preach sir look brother Brandon the gospel is the word of God he said not all together brother the Bible said the gospel came to us not in word only but also but through Power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost to preach the word the letter kth but the spirit giveth life Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel then interpret to Every Creature then interpret it in the Bible forms means to go into all the world and demonstrate the power of the word by the Holy Ghost demonstrate the power of the word by the Holy Ghost and these signs shall follow them that believe which signs what signs we go to church we pay our dues we treat our neighbor right that's wonderful but that ain't what Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe these signs in my name they shall cast out Devils come on now amen speak with new tongues it's the Bible take up serpents drink deadly things lay hands upon the sick and they shall [Applause] recover but you know he said the Holy Spirit he's the one that quickens the promise how you going past that how you going to get past that the Holy Spirit should know for he's the life that's in the word he's the one that quickens the word just like your spirit quickens your body without the spirit in this body this body's dead the body is quickened by the spirit without the spirit the body is no effect the body is dead the word is dead without the spirit it takes Spirit to bring forth the word to make it live and he is the quickener of the word now you can't have all spirit and no word either amen so when brother Brandon was talking about some of those that are jumping and shouting and carrying on and going after a gift he was talking to word rejectors I'm not a word rejector amen it's the word that I see that get that causes a reaction on the inside of me when I see his word being fulfilled I seen he sent Malachi 4 I seen he sent Revelations 10:7 I see it all being fulfilled and it causes something on the inside of me Hallelujah I've also saw that my name's been written on the book and when John saw it he said all of Heaven all of all all the Earth all below the Earth heard I John Shout in why because it was something on the inside of it he saw it wasn't just dead letter no more but he was there he was in the book he was in there and I have also saw that I am in the book it isn't just about Ruth and Rebecca and Abraham and Sarah and a bunch of stories and fairy tales no it's telling about me it's telling about you it's telling about all of us in the day that we live in and it caus us to rejoice God so pardon me that's right amen you know brother brand talked about this and I also been in this same place but thankfully I was in the daylight and it was still a spooky Place brother Brandon finds himself out in the whole burnover one day or one night on the moon lit night he said he' been you know what he said this man was little different he said he was wanting to get a closer look at a Grizzly that ain't me no no no no that ain't me but he finds himself trying to find this grizzly and gets out kind of turned around and finds himself in this place after dark and he's he finds himself there and he's and the wind begins to hit him and and he begins to look at this old burnover and these old Pines that once stood there so beautifully but now they grave look like a graveyard a spooky looking place and here come a wind coming down wind began to hit him and go moo that's time I heard that brother Doug Baker took me up on Mount Lemon it just had experienced of fire was sitting on the side of that mountain wind got to blowing up through there and may heard that noise it make the hair stand up on I couldn't imagine what it' be like on a moonlit night but anyway he he said see what had happened he said I stood there I thought what is what is the Lord trying to show me here and these trees but he said I'm begin to realize these trees put me in the mind of some of these great F inspired churches just as dead as a doornail even the Palmer worms eat all the bark off of them and everything the fiery trials has blazed all the spirit away and there's nothing left but a great big stature just as dead as it can be and he said when the rushing Mighty Wind comes from Heaven the only thing they can do is grown and carry on and say it ain't so knowing know not hardly knowing anything and they say days of Miracles are passed listen that's not just denominational systems anymore that's message there's message preachers saying we're not in the days of Miracles no more why because these these fires have burn off the bark burn off the life and the spirit of God can't resonate in their life no more and just about it just every time God sends a Revival and signs of Wonders begin to come follow among the people they say all the days of Miracles are pass he said I sat there and that was scripture come to mind it was over in Joy what the palor worm left the caterer eaten what the caterpillars left the loc is eaten on down different insects have eaten out of the life of the tree if you notice that's the same insect all all the way down it's just different manifestations of it he said here I stand in them trees once they were great trees once they had a great kingly position and they moved kingly as the wind blew them but now what's the difference something happened the sapl line the lifeline of that tree has been taken away wow I thought what does this mean I began to think of the places where I've been people I'd heard iosing I heard opposing saying the days of Miracles are passed I thought that's right that's just like some of those great big high aspired churches that stand with great big names behind them historical names that once we were so and so once we were so and so but the lifeline has been cut you know we was at we had our family Camp there in Texas it was at a Nazarene Campground first year we was there there was some helpers some volunteers had come to help them work on that thing and so they would come to some of the services one of the older men sat in the back and he just he would just ball wouldn't he just ball cry his eyes out and and we we get through the service and he walked out and told Brother Daryl backer one of our deacons he says he said I sit here in amazement he said because I'm a Nazarene he said we used to have services like that I'm thinking used to you can still have them amen not maybe where you're at move there you go move with the spirit of God it left a long time ago move with it amen listen this is where we are facing as a message Community if I can say it that way amen the bark is being stripped off they're calling it fanaticism they're calling it a bunch of emotional workup they're calling it all kind of ugly names and it's the spirit of God that's wanting to move among the people to set them free yeah amen listen I I don't care if a man's a teacher a preacher evangelist if he's preaching things of a gone day gone by he's preaching something that ain't true amen he said listen he says it right here he said a denomination from time of the early reformation and their Founders he said what happened he said a new set of teachers got in and cut all the real life of the Holy Spirit out they were made to a away they made they were made to sway in the rushing Mighty Wind like came on the day of Pentecost but now when God continually sends us wind they lay down only thing they can do is moan they moan the days of Miracles are passed there's no such a thing as the baptism of the holy spirit all these things are passed away what a spooky place to be oh wow what a spooky place to be I thought oh no no doubt they were trees they had history behind them trees but the life was gone and he said that's what's the matter with a Pentecostal Presbyterian Methodist Baptist Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness and the denominational bugs has eat the life out of it and it just become an old dead spire and we need what we need is a coming of the rushing Mighty Wind and a new Lifeline to receive it and a new Lifeline to receive it he said oh don't misunderstand me I'm not condemning the church or the organization I'm condemning the lack of Christ in those places the only thing that makes them grown and moan when God sends the Holy Ghost Revival to the world is because of the lack of flexible life in them to receive it the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost for whosoever will believe it shall receive it Peter said it in Acts 2:38 repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and your children and to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God will call if God is still calling the holy spirit is still falling I didn't make that up that's a direct quote if the God is still calling the Holy Ghost is still falling it's got to be but we find them we find them where they've lost all the power they lost the ability they don't even believe in praying for the sick no more they don't believe in prayer lines and altar calls and all that's out and I'm not even talking about denominational I'm talking about us it's all put there somewhere else listen if the spirit if God is still calling the spirit's still falling yes sir God is still healing God is still delivering God is still setting free God is still saving amen we're still here so he's still doing it he's still doing what he said he was going to do amen he said I Noti this he said he said let me tell you brother God's but he said he said I looked at that and he said I thought my what's going to happen here he said I no just down underneath there was some undergrowth coming up some little bushes that had life in them when the wind be to hit them they was twisting and ringing and shouting having a glorious time let me tell you brother God's going to raise up a generation come on brother hlj Hallelujah God's going to raise up a generation of people out of all this dead stuff that's going to restore sayeth the Lord God's going to raise up people who believe in signs and wonders God's going to raise up people who's got joy unspeakable and full of glory and when the Runing Mighty Wind come it'll give right to it it'll Frolic it'll dance it'll glorify God green leaves or clap their hands having a wonderful time what a Frolic that little undergrowth was having while those big old trees standing there moaning and groaning same wind that's a direct quote same wind oh one groaning one making fun one saying it's a bunch of emotional markups son saying that well it's just a preacher who knows how to work up a crowd same wind meanwhile wind is blowing through this one's being delivered that one's being set free that was being saved that particle's coming home same wind I say let it blow let the spirit of God move and let it blow through our hearts blow through our lives and may we be somebody who got a Lifeline that's got the ability to move when it [Applause] moves you say well why does the children of God carry on like this why you know if I'm shouting I'm shouting from a heart that's been washed clean Hallelujah if I'm dancing I'm dancing from a life that's been changed if I'm running I'm running because my life has been redeemed amen so action that causes a reaction yes same wind was making one moaning grown and given the other a big [Applause] timeall oh I happen to say well what what what what's this one doing and every time that little tree would twist what was doing it was pulling at the roots loosening up the ground so it' grow deeper and get a better hold every time God sends his blessings upon Born Again Christians upon the born again man a woman it's only loosen up the roots to grow deeper and higher and better and Freer I will restore sayith the Lord where that one was burnt down the other one is going to grow up as sure as the worldall hallelujah hallelujah if there was ever a needy time is right now amen amen hallelujah they take a man and teach him the language of a native they take him about 10 years into college put 10 years of education in it the only thing you need is a baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's what he said you don't need all that education wait for nothing God called you get going amen get going he said he sent Steven down there where they tried to kill him and everything else he was like a house on fire in a windy day put him out if you can the more you f it the worse it's going to get Hallelujah that's what happens to a fire the real fire amen listen the fire that we're talking about is not a man-made fire or a man decreed fire or man's ability to a fire it ain't got nothing to do with a man it's a god ordained fire it's a fire fell on the day of Pentecost it's still burning today and it's still moving through hearts and lives and the devil wants to Fan it and he wants to try to put it out devil you ain't doing nothing but going to make it get bigger and bigger and bigger until we move from this real round into another real people get scared of the anointing scared of the moving of the spirit but it takes that Moses tried to do it on his own what happened one dead Egyptian fled to a backside of a desert backslid for 40 years he's out there minding his father-in-law's sheep and all of a sudden he sees a a bush that's on fire and it ain't burning he's like well I'm going to go check that out that's interesting he he walks up towards that burning bush and out of that bush speaks a voice said Moses Moses listen God God knew where Moses was the whole time Moses thought he done hit himself out and he done forgot about being the deliver and all he' been taught his whole life and all it was all backside didn't burn him out on the back side of a desert but God hadn't forgot God had spoke a word and it was going to come to pass and here he comes up and God calls him by name and he begins to speak to to him and reveal to him and show him signs show him wonders and tells him go down to go down tell Pharaoh let my people go and of course Moses had all kinds of excuses listen God knows how to deal with your excuses wow he's got an answer to them amen I don't care who you are what you are if you got excuses tonight God knows how to answer excuses and he deals with all of excuses takes them all away and the next thing you know Moses is going down to Egypt with a donkey a wife and a couple of children and a a rod and where you going Moses what are you doing you're moving down and get some better grass no I'm going down to Egypt what you going down to Egypt for some corn some wheat no I'm going down to take over I'm going down to tell that old Pharaoh it's had he's had the children of God long enough and it's time you let them go it's time you let them go I have a word amen it's not my word I tried to do it a long time ago on my own but I have heard a word from a bush and that bush had a fire in it and that fire was not burning that bush it was a a supernatural thing and it spoke to me and it told me my doubts it told me my frustration it answered all my questions and I'm going down to take over Hallelujah you have to come in contact with the same burning bush the same fire the same one will answer all your questions and resolve he's the dissolver of doubts yes he knows how to get you where he wants you whether you want who are not Hallelujah old Samson what was it it was just a weakling a nothing until the spirit of God began to move on him matter of fact he wasn't that good of a person he lived in a day you know the spirit of God would come down and it would leave it would come down and it would leave we're not in we're living in a day where the spirit of God will come down and it'll dwell in a man but he would come under the anointing and get under the anointing and kill a thousand egypti or a thousand Philistines incredible with what a bazooka no a Jawbone a dried up Jawbone that looked like nothing looked impossible but you know I I got to thinking about this how stupid are them Philistines that are stand there for a whole thousand and let a dude kill them with a Jawbone the same ones that was stupid enough to stand there with shamgar and with Ox gold and kill 600 of them I mean you would think think 550 50th one would say hey boys I'm out of here I'm Cutting Loose there's something else going on dumb Old Devil amen he's a good adversary he keeps coming he keeps coming listen this devil knows he's got a date that it's a expiration day he knows he's not an eternal being he knows he's a doomed devil but he still fights and he still fights and he still comes and he still pushes and he still honks and he still scratches at your door knowing he's a defeated enemy how much more should you fight when you know you're Son of God you know your daughter of God you're not a temporary being but you have been changed and your life is an eternal pit it ought to put something on the inside of you that'll fight it ain't up to brother Jason to do all the fighting or the ministry to do all the fighting or the song leader to do all the fighting or the musician to do we are all called to this battle Hallelujah I want the spirit of God to move they sing the right song now why don't you get in the spirit come on why don't you come to church in the spirit when we'll Worship in the spirit and we'll let God move and our enemies be scattered sir yes sir God what we find we find another one David this a little Shepherd boy me and brother mat was talking about being over in Israel I got this chance to stand there in that Valley get some stones out of that same Brook look up there they found diggings over their encampments and things on both sides the hill on this side heill on this side I can just imagine Goliath's voice as he' come out and I kept stepping up out of that Valley looking for her you know your imagination like how' David feel let me grab another Stone he listen David David didn't go down into the valley because because he fought well he went down in the valley because he believed well he believed in his God he believed that he was the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and he knew that he would been with him in the lon and the bear and he said this GI will be just like him if you just let me go fight him he'll be dead just like the rest of him amen there was anointing on him he had come into the presence of the prophet of God and what the prophet had he poured out upon David's life it wasn't a public show it wasn't everybody knew it he he had critic sure his brothers didn't believe him they were everyone called to be anointed before he was amen amen they were chosen before he would be chosen and the prophet said do you not have one more son he said oh yeah I got another he's well go get him we're not going to sit down till he gets here and he comes and he pours the anointing oil on him yeah David had his critics he had his brothers that didn't believe him his dad didn't believe him but he was anointed amen he was anointed to be king and he come walking into the cing and he hears that challenge brother brand said that giant got up and he made his challenge at 40th Day He said but there was a different set of ears in the camp Hallelujah there was somebody that was there that morning that hadn't been there the rest of the 39 morning he had got up every day put on his armor ate his breakfast grabbed his sh swords put it on all his stuff walked out made his challenge nobody come went back over and over and over but on this day it was his last day to get up and put on his s sword to put on his armor it was his last day to eat his breakfast it was his last day amen to come and make his challenge cuz there was a different set of ears in the camp there was somebody who believed in the god of Jehovah there was somebody believe he ain't just God back there he's God right now come on now is there somebody here that can believe amen you don't come here because you fight well you come here because you believe well and you believe that God's still a Healer he's still a deliverer it doesn't matter what you feel like it doesn't matter the feelings it doesn't matter the anxiety or the fear God is still [Applause] God last day there any anointed David's here today they say Goliath this is your last day Hallelujah somebody needs to say that spirit of fear this is your last day depression this is your last moment sickness this is your last service this day your head's coming off on the spirit of God is upon me and it's the same one that fell upon David has fallen upon me it's not another God it's not another spirit it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever The Same Spirit that begin to woo over the Earth is in this building amen you say well how do you know brother Timothy cuz his word says He is where two or three are gathered in my name there I'll be do we got anybody here that come in his name all right then he's here Amen brother Bram said like this the other day I heard him on tape he said he said you said he said that light is here he said brother brandom do you see it he said no I don't see it but his word says he's here I thought God that's so wonderful you think the prophet always saw it he didn't always see it but he always knew it he knew he was with him he knew he was there he because the the angel of God and said the never failing presence of God is with you wherever you may [Applause] go I may not see that light visibly before me tonight but I know he's here cuz his word says he's here and that same spirit that moved upon the Earth and Chaos was turned into a garden of hidden when God speaks the spirit mov amen when God speaks he gives strength when God speaks everything and anything is perfect when God speaks it's forever when God speaks anything though it linger it will come to pass when God speaks it's certain eternally certain when God speaks no uncertain sound about it these are just Snippets of quotes when God speaks that it's so then you believe it because it is so when God speaks it's just the same as done when God speaks word it's already finished when God speaks he'll never take it back when God speaks all hell moves when God speaks act and do it and he will perform it Hallelujah 1 Thessalonians 5: 19 says quench not the spirit amen amen that quench not means to extinguish or to suppress that's what the word means it means to quench or to put out the fire when it comes don't try to push it down am and say it's just a motion or some workout workup don't turn it down other words don't become a spiritual fire extinguisher wow wow bunch of wet blankets you know throwing over on the fire and I can't believe it you know don't be a spiritual fire extinguisher call it it just a bunch of Pentecost call it all kind of names he said you ask him to come to your church sometimes and he'll fall in the oldfashioned way and you're ashamed to let loose and let him have his way you quench him away you invite him to your home and then you're ashamed of him before your neighbors let him sit there unentertained Jesus wants to be worshiped he wants to be entertained how do you entertain Jesus say Jesus Come into my heart I love you Lord entertain him don't let him pass you by if someone comes to your house and you don't entertain them they won't come many times maybe that's what's the matter tonight maybe that's what's the matter around our homes around our churches we're afraid or ashamed to entertain Jesus you're afraid somebody will hear you say Amen on you're afraid or ashamed somebody will hear you say praise the Lord you're afraid to raise your hands and give him praise you're afraid to cause your neighbor sitting there or somebody else cuz your neighbor sitting there somebody else what do you care about your neighbor Worship the Lord you ask him to come you invited him to come then worship him when he comes he said we need that tonight as a oldfashioned Jesus Christ entertaining place I love that where men and women can forget their themselves and entertain Jesus listen we have entertained all kind of other thoughts already thoughts of Tomorrow thoughts of yesterday thoughts of our neighbor next to us let's just let go for a moment amen Jesus in our is his word says he is so let's entertain him we don't have to be ashamed of our worship we don't have to be ashamed of it the critics can call it rock and roll they can call it all they want to we don't have to be ashamed of talented musicians no no we don't have to be ashamed of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost we don't have to be ashamed of dancing and shouting no no we don't have to be ashamed of noise worship Him Anyway worship Him anyhow you can't win with a Critic they're always that's what they are and that's what they do you probably heard this story you live by Air Force Base been hearing them vo voo all over the place there was a down in Pensacola Florida I just tell it for the sake of telling it but down in Pensacola Florida there was this new neighborhood they wanted to put in so they built this big time neighborhood it was a it was expensive homes and right by the Air Force Base the Blue Angels are down there and all that stuff that go so all of a sudden they trying to sleep in get by their brand new million dooll home and they lay in their four five $6,000 bed and and they begin to CL they begin to uh complain to the city hall and you know and say well look we there's too much noise here we we got a problem we got you know what we going to do about it surely they can only fly at certain times let us get our rest and so you know what that air base did it put up a big sign it said pardon the noise it's just the sound of Freedom we invented that I like that yeah maybe it was here they did it we invented y'all invented I'll give it to you so pardon the noise if you want to get upset because there's a lot of noise in our churches pardon us on it's only Jesus coming through it's only him Healing The Sick and raising the dead and healing Cancers and and healing diseases and healing back troubles and healing all kinds of it's only Jesus coming through and I know where Jesus is there's a lot of noise part of the noise is just the sound of Freedom hallelujah amen when somebody's been set free from drugs and alcohol and things of the darkness of this world they can't help but Proclaim I serve a living God he's the same yesterday today and forever he changed my life I can't help but worship him I can't help but praise him I can't help but give him glory I can't help but sing his Praises cuz I know what he's done for me I know what I was and I know what I am I know what I used to be but I know who God has called me to be pardon the noise amen God maybe you come here like that Prophet all stewed up tonight Satan tends to do that on a meeting night you know meetings are not easy to oh yeah I know I'm on the right track now meetings ain't easy all kind of things can happen stuff get tore up this that and the other and people get stewed up and stirred up and temper that's what happened to this prophet he he got him they had a meeting and he seen somebody out there he didn't really like and he got all stirred up why did he come in here why is he here what is wrong he said the spirit of God couldn't come on that stewed up prophet he said but he had to get him a minstral and begin to play an oldfashioned Holy Ghost Song Glory and the spirit of God came down on the pro that's why our music is important that's why our song leading is important it ain't just getting up singing a pretty tune no it's leading in worship it's creating an atmosphere so that atmospheres can be settled and Demon Spirits can be driven out listen God knew what he was doing when he sent the worshippers before the Warriors he did it Time After Time After Time he would actually sometimes and they would go and sing and before they could ever pull a sword God had already defeated their enemy wow wow because of what they done in worshiping him amen it happens I wish I knew the key though there sometimes you can come to a service and from the word go it's like a torch settling torch is blowing you know and blowing out cutting out metal and all kinds of it's incredible then sometimes you come and you're just pushing and pushing and pushing don't seem like you ever get I wish I knew what the key was I I believe it's an [Applause] expectation I believe it's expecting God to move and God to change lives and God to heal and God to do what he said he would do amen and this is what happened his the man the prophet expectations got changed he said see he said the spirit of God come down on the prophet that's right God doesn't change God Like Music in that day God likes music today he began to sing an old song I don't know what they played in them day but I imagine a good old song like there is going to be a meeting in the air in the sweet sweet well I like the slow song by and by on God's on song will be the leading one something like that some of them good oldfashioned Holy Ghost songs and the spirit of God came on the prophet he said I tell you brother when you get all the formal shackles shook off and the spirit of God and the songs again and get back to an old place where we can have the spirit of God moving again then the prophet can see a vision then the powers of God can come into the church then we will see Divine Healing then we'll see the resurrection of Christ then we'll see the same yesterday today and forever you say well brother brandom I'm not a prophet well if you ain't a prophet you can can be one of the instruments anyhow wow that's right you ain't got no more than them 10 strings give bit to them as hard as you can amen if you can't be a prophet be one of the minstrels do something to bring the spirit of the Lord down yeah amen it ain't all behind the desk it's right there do something to bring the Holy Ghost down it might be a cry that says God come by my way and all of a sudden the spirit of God comes and answers that prayer it can happen Hallelujah do something to bring the spirit of God down just tell you you probably heard the story but it's again my mom had her first brain bleed and she's back home and and she's sitting on the side of her bed distraught wondering how things are going going to be wonder how her life's going to be kind of the dump so to speak actually brother Mike and sister Bethany we living with them at the time where they were building their house living in the upstairs and she brought little Drew set him in the middle of the floor oh Drew special little child he's 18 months old never walked or crawled but he had been seen in a vision walking just a few months prior to that in a prayer line why I still believe in prayer lines amen cuz I know they still work amen and so here they are here they are she's she's in this situation uh Bethany comes in begins to talk to her and it goes like this she just begin to turn from her thoughts of the moment to her thoughts of God and how good he'd been to her and she just begin to raise her hands there in her bedroom and she began to worship God right there in the bedroom and that you know what that did that was a Minstrel to bring the spirit of God down and the spirit of God fell in that room and in that moment my mom was giving her eyesight back you couldn't see on the peripheral vision from that brain bleed and it was restored and as it went across to her it moved across to her and across little Drew sitting over there in the middle of the floor a little 18-y old boy that never walked or crawled underdeveloped in one of his hips or something was wrong with him the doctor said going to need all kinds of things but anyway the spirit of God moves and out of the floor this little little boy stands up wow and it begins to run all over the house ran all over the house I remember that day getting a video little Drew running all over his house and M his mom running behind him with a camera look at him run look at him run look what was it it was because somebody became a Minstrel they got their thoughts off of what their condition and their thoughts over their present time and what was going on and what was happening and what was wrong and what future was and got their thoughts on their God come on somebody somebody do that tonight get it off your thoughts get it off your problems get it off your pressures and get it on your God and if you'll get it on your God he is still on the throne he is still in control the devil does not have control over your life over your life over anybody's life God is on the throne and he's still in control over you [Applause] we just need a minstral need somebody that'll move into the realm of the Holy Ghost and begin to cry out and say God I need you don't pass me by this weekend don't pass me by In This Moment I need a touch and I'm not going on without you I need more than I had yesterday spirit of God move yeah that's how I say it here when the Holy Spirit begins to move and give discernment and that is to bring the presence of God Among the people notice what he says discernment God the spirit begins to move and brings discernment that's to bring the spirit of God Among the people just like just like singing a hym shouting a message given in unknown tongues or something it brings the spirit of God Among the people yeah you heard your pastor preach it many times on the word under the spirit gets the moveing into the people and they just scream out they can't hold their peace no more because the spirit of God begins to move he said the spirit of God takes the word to the congregation and feeds them and they grow spiritually on that word why because of the spirit of God bringing it to them Hallelujah if it isn't the spirit of God it's man's intellectual abilities now we don't want that as what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 2 he said and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and power so that your faith would not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God today with great intellectual messages they can explain it to you see the picture it's a direct quote that isn't this a surge we would see Jesus he said that isn't what we're looking for tonight we're not looking for the mechanics we're looking looking for the Dynamics we got the mechanics of the religions of the Bible so bized it looks like a great big 16 or 35 coach trained sitting out there on the track but they ain't got enough steam in it to move it down it takes the Dynamics to perform the mechanics that's what we need now is to see that that's what we've been taught all these years is the truth or is it not it's been explained over and over and over through different Seminary churches so forth until we're looking to see who this person is you say well brother brandham how would you do it well did you notice they came to the servant of Christ who had been trained to how to what to do not just to say sit down stay waake you sit right here I explain it no he brought them straight to him he brought them straight to him because that's what they wanted to see they said we would see Jesus not would you explain it to us and tell us all about it that wasn't the question they wanted to see Jesus they wanted to see Jesus he said we find we couldn't find him and find lectures and we cuz people find find people who can stand up and explain the word in such a way it's just breathtaking but what we find is just a lecture it's just mechanics we find an Entertainer and go through all the action and so forth that still isn't it what we're looking for we're finding the religious type with the ropes on and so forth we're not not what we're looking for no we're looking for the person Jesus Christ Jesus Christ manifested the same yesterday today and forever so we're out in the middle again because there is everything this is church says we got it that church says we got it this church says we got it and so forth if you got it you would show it if you got it you would show it the person Christ Jesus God is here Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever his power is just the same today as it was he does not fail he will not fail he is God he has to remain God right sir we would see Jesus not hear the mechanics but see the dynamic of him all right amen Jesus said go into all the world and preach preach the gospel he didn't say this is a direct quote teach this or teach that go and preach the preach is to demonstrate the power of the Holy Spirit now that's not against godall teachers a godall teacher will still demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost amen these signs shall follow them if it don't come by lecture that's right they that believe it doesn't come by lecture it comes by the presence of the Living God moving Among Us in human flesh proving himself he's the same yesterday today and forever he never fails to be the same it comes so simple that the Simplicity of it is what drives the intellectual mind away from it we said last night we have so much of the mechanics amen this is a different quote we got so much of the mechanics and not the Dynamics my body is the mean mechanics but my body will not operate without the Dynamics the spirit the spirit operates my body and brings it into control another place in Fall world falling apart he said we study the mechanics until it's all mechanical but we want the Dynamics we we can study the mechanics of how you wire a building how you put all white wires is this and neutral and the black wires is the power and the bar wires the ground and and you got these plugs and you put these here and you do this all here and there's got to be certain codes but if it ain't got no power to it what good is all that won't light nothing it wouldn't light a a smallest of a light bulb it wouldn't do nothing but if you put the power to it it'll cause things to react it'll cause things to move it'll cause things to operate it'll cause all the things that's in the word if you'll put the power to it all these are all this mechanic is all wonderful and we need every bit of it but we also need the P power of the mechanics amen the spirit that could come behind the word and begin to make it live in our lives amen that is not a bunch of head knowledge we got a bunch of people that's got doctor degrees in the message but they can't live a life worthy of the Gospel but I'm here to tell you there is a power that can come into a life that can change them from glory to glory and they never be the same [Applause] again Lord we have taught it so much in in the message ranks that people have taught the moving of the spirit all the way out that we don't even need the baptism of the Holy Ghost no more that ain't nothing but a false worm that's got in this message it's time to cut it out we need the power of God we need the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost we need the one who's the resurrection and the life the one that Rose him from the dead and is still here moving in his children we don't need just a bunch of dead theology the Sun is up therefore if the Sun is up we can have both Dynamics and mechanics the spirit of God and the word of God we need both of them that's what makes the engine go down the road let's bow our heads Mercy this ain't some mythical story but it's a reality ain't some yesterday's knowledge it's a it's a it's a power of word for today he here to make it live here to operate change lives change you from Glory unto Glory made one step why not make another step a continuation it ain't get the Holy Ghost and put a period to it or get justification and that's all sanctification no keep moving keep moving allowing him to come and move through your life and move out the worldly influences and worldly thoughts and we want him to be God and we worship him as God but many times we don't want him to be Lord that's to have rulership or ownership over our lives through this weekend would say Lord let me be a minstral yes let me be a minstral if the Holy Ghost can move down through yes Lord let me be one Lord let me know you in the fullness of the power of the resurrected Jesus Christ

together one to can you say it the Lord is wonderful to me hallelujah praise the name of the Lord you know I was thinking thinking as brother Timothy was speaking right out of the gate all that chaos and darkness and Gloom yeah but you know God had seed down in there and it occurred to me that God doesn't do something for nothing if he put the seed down in there he was always going to bring it out the only thing brother Bram said that darkness that Gloom that chaos oh it was just in the way so the voice of God spoke and said Let There Be Love he wasn't talking to the sun it was already there he wasn't talking to the seed it was already there amen yeah the seed is already in you God would not have put that seed in you if he didn't intend for it to come out oh friends why don't you cast aside your fear and open up your heart and say Lord bring everything out of this seed of gene of God that you have ordained before the foundation of the world amen amen I found out something tonight I finally got an answer to the mystery why I cannot keep my foot off the throttle when I'm preaching I found out that it's because there's an unseen force of the holy ghost moving us and it excites that Born Again Spirit Hallelujah finally have an answer amen I thought I was just weird but I am not weird neither are you but that Holy Spirit excites my Born Again Spirit oh blessed be the name of the Lord you know I'm tell you something seriously friends I thought about David you know do you ever realize and if you say no I never realized it then you were standing with me I never thought about it till tonight brother Timothy was bringing that out David didn't David didn't get an Angelic visit there there was nothing David didn't have a vision I mean you know brother bradam talked about the strength he said oh if I could just see a vision he said then it wouldn't matter you know you don't know what that does David didn't see a vision no a no angel visited David and said you're going to go and this what's going to happen do you know the only thing that happened to David is David remembered that God had already delivered him from a lion and a bear in the line of duty now I don't know if you've ever met anyone but a highly doubt you've ever met a human that runs toward a lion or runs toward a bear everybody runs away from them David ran towards them in the line of duty and slew them with a slingshot in his bare hands what farmer have you ever seen a Rancher run toward an animal with his bare hands to save one of his livestock a bear or a lion maybe if he's got a rifle David didn't have a rifle David had to run towards him with no Angelic visit and no vision and brother brandham said it like this David just when he saw that lion grabb that sheep he knew he had a duty to protect his father's sheep he saw when he saw that bear and he said David said now Lord I'm I'm here that's my responsibility now you be with me and he took off you say you know but the but the Goliath was impossible the bear was impossible the lion was impossible David didn't need a vision David just knew that God had already done the impossible and all he done was remember that friends how how many times have we have to say I'm ashamed to say that how many times I have forgotten all the impossible things the Lord has already done for me and I come up on Impossible thing and I say oh it's impossible oh my why don't you remember how many God impossible things that you can testify tonight and say I know God did this and it was impossible oh throw down your fear throw down your Gloom cast aside that chaos and allow the word of God to bring forth that seed Lord oh my goodness my goodness I'm sure you can tell the Holy Spirit excites my born again Spirit you love the Lord do you enjoy the word of God tonight you want to go out of here and do it that way now be like David say I'm going to just remember what God has already done for me and when he heard that uncircumcised Philistine he said here's another impossible situation the same God that delivered the me from The Lion that's what he said it's what he told the king king said you can't fight him he's a warrior you're just a youth he said but but I but the Lord already the same God that delivered me from The Lion and delivered me from the bear will deliver me from this sun to David it was a no-brainer oh I want to have that kind of Faith friends don't live in chaos whatever you do don't live in chaos don't live in Gloom don't live in darkness you know why you shouldn't do that because you don't have to you don't have to God has provided a word that can set us free amen we're not going to linger and keep you thank you for coming to the house of God tonight we'll be right back here tomorrow night at the same time Amen brother Tim will be ministering for us tomorrow night they're going to alternate as they go God bless you friends let's sing another song brother mat the star one and all knows how
