TRANSCRIPT
========================================
father Lord we come before you this morning humbly inviting you into our little Sunday school this morning Lord we ask that You' meet us here father that this little thought of my heart might help somebody make some encouragement might Comfort The Afflicted and maybe afflict the comfortable a little Lord give us an encouragement to always hold to your promise of salvation always hold to your promise of all your promises in the word Lord that without you we could do nothing father we ask you would Grant inspiration to the word that we're going to read father that though we may have words on a page that the letter alone would just kill us father but your spirit would bring life so we ask that you would bring us revelation of the word as we would read it this morning and to invite you into our Sunday school that you would move on the hearts of the people that you'd be with us throughout not just the Sunday school but the worship service and then into the into the main service Lord that our hearts would be open and that the needs of the people would be met we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen um I want to turn this morning for a text to uh St John chapter 14 and we're going to go to verse 6 16 John chap 14 and verse 16 all right I'm going to read here it says and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever amen you all can have your seats um I want to take a title this morning um it's a little bit of a I admit a little bit of a tongue and- cheek kind of a title called good people go to heaven and you know we you hear this a lot it's kind of a cliche almost and almost you know especially in you know properly uh taught Christians you know this idea of oh will good people go to heaven you know it's really not that simple um but you know people have this idea it's kind of like a secular belief kind of like this you know maybe in the nominal Christian World well I'm a good person you know I I you know I don't do nothing too too terribly wrong you know I I you know I don't commit adultery I don't lie I don't cheat I don't steal you know I you know I I may have my faults and my failures but you know I'm a good person and I'm sure God will understand that you know when I you know day of judgment you know I'll somehow I'll be a good enough person then that'll my good will cancel out my bad you know on the whole I'm a good person yeah and you know and so we have this you know if I'm just good enough I'll go to heaven or or you know good people go to heaven and it's it's it's a cliche and it you know people fall into it and people gravitate towards that notion because there is a little kernel of Truth in it right there is a little piece of Truth in that it's just not what people really expect and it's not what people fully understand and so I you know to to flesh this out I want to turn to uh Matthew St Matthew chapter 19 and verse 16 um I'll turn and says and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou will enter into life keep this Commandments keep the Commandments now couple things I want to point out about this number one Jesus did not correct him right he didn't say don't call me good there's only one good but God that's not what he said he clarifi ified do you know what you just said and did you mean it right he's he's and the other thing to bear in mind is Jesus knows that he knows the thoughts and intents of the heart he knows what the Rich Young Ruler meant when he said that right he's not asking for his own edification he's getting this young man to confirm to himself I'm speaking to God In the Flesh amen right that's what he's doing he's he's establishing this that when this young man is asking him for how do I attain eternal life he's going to get the actual answer it's not going to be a a a you know just some you know wise man's belief it's going to be actual God In the Flesh giving him the answer to that question and so he says you know keep the Commandments and then the and the man says um he said unto him which and Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal thou shall not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the young man saith unto him all these things have I kept from my youth youth up what lack I yet and Jesus said unto him if thou wil be perfect go and sell that thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me and when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions now the interesting what you know what I gravitate what what my sticks out to me is number one when the man came to him in the first place he's asked him what good thing must I do right he's got this mentality it's this that that exact mentality of if I'm just a good enough person I'll make it right I can gain eternal life by doing some service to God what good thing do I got to do and you know Jesus says okay we'll keep the Commandments he's okay well I've kept all the Commandments and okay so then now there's this other the last thing he's got to do is sell all that he has amen and go follow Jesus now Jesus didn't tell him to sell all that he had and start from zero and no you know go live your life donate everything you have to the poor and then you know you can do whatever you want after that right the key part there is to come follow me part right because there was a bunch there were there were disciples with Jesus who they they didn't Peter didn't keep the Commandments from the time he was a youth you know Peter was a was a a rascal right you know all these you know St Matthew he was a a a crooked tax collector he was a cheat you know amen he you know there's all these PE these people were not they didn't keep the Commandments from their youth but the key thing was whatever it was that they had they gave it up to follow Jesus it wouldn't have mattered what it was in particular it's just that they gave it up in order to follow Jesus that was the key part and you know people have this mentality of it it wasn't about and so you know in the scientific world we would say if there's something that changes you know things that things that change or don't change or whatever and it doesn't affect the outcome we call those irrelevant variables right whether or not he was a good person whether or not he kept the Commandments up until that point was kind of irrelevant it didn't really matter because some people didn't keep the Commandments he clearly did keep the Commandments the people who didn't keep the Commandments got eternal life and he didn't so the keeping of The Commandments wasn't really relevant up until that point now that also there's a balance to that there is also not a justification to just live any old way right in order to follow Jesus you still have to keep the Commandments once you're following Jesus there is a mandate to keep those Commandments and if you have some verbal Ascent to Christ as a savior but have no intention of keeping Commandments then okay you you know that CH you know Jesus is the Christ that so do the Devils right there there has to be a life lived in that but the point is attainment to you know being a good person isn't through some sort of works right you know doing good things doesn't make you a good person because there's only one good but God and you're not going to become God through good works right so but like I said there is a kernel of Truth in that statement good people go to heaven right there's a kernel of Truth in that and that's why it's deceptive right that's why people gravitate towards it um because all good Lies start on a truth um at least the really deceptive ones do and I want to turn to uh back to St John 14 and kind of show you the way I want to where my mind is on that uh this is St John chapter 14 and verse 16 says and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you amen right so he's identifying himself right because he dwelleth with you well who's dwelling with them right then well Christ was dwelling with them right then um and shall be in you and I will leave you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you and he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them um he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him so again there at the at the end to reiterate this idea that oh well you know I'll just have some mental Ascent that you know I I love Jesus well no you don't you don't actually unless you're keeping Commandments right there there is that stipulation you there you know you can say what you want to but unless you're conf coning to what Christ commanded you to how Christ commanded you to live there's no actual love there but notice Christ is is indicating uh something and I want to turn to First John want to kind of start wrapping up uh 1 John chapter 4 and we'll start at verse one and he says um beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye that the spirit of know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world verse four ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so um looking at verse two again it says if you want to know if you want to have discernment and be able to discern what Spirits are of God you know what spirit is of God then here's here's a good way here's the indicator right every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God okay and then going down every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God right and and that spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ come in the flesh is the anti Spirit of antichrist that you've heard about and so I'm telling you in this day so many people are running to and fro looking for all the Antichrist is coming coming even you know non- message people you know secular or not um not secular but uh nominal Christian people people who you know don't really you know believe the message even people are everyone's looking for the Antichrist people can see that in the the world is kind of looking a lot like the Book of Revelations at this point um and everyone's looking for the Antichrist oh what's the Antichrist going to be who's the Antichrist you know well here's the an you know you we the Bible tells the Antichrist is coming so if you want to know what it is and what it looks like here you go it's the one that says Jesus Christ has not come in the flesh that's the spirit that you got to look out for and interesting language that was used there I think because number one it said Jesus Christ Has Come In the Flesh now when Jesus is on the Earth all right let let me put it like this me let me make an analogy if I say you know uh uh you know brother Travis Jackson is come in the flesh and you know you someone's going to try to deny that brother Travis Jackson is come in the flesh well it's obvious the fact that I even have a name to attach that shows that he was come in the flesh he's on Earth he's a he's a physical person right no one was referring to God to God as Jesus Christ before Jesus Christ came Came In the Flesh right doesn't you know he was Jehovah he was you know Yahweh he was a lot of different things but he was never Jesus Christ until he came in the flesh okay so to deny so it doesn't make any sense why someone would try to deny that Jesus Christ came in the flesh if they're talking about the man who walked on the shores of Galilee right no one's going to deny that people met him right this book is written by someone who literally met him what John is saying is the spirit of the Antichrist is the one that says Jesus not Christ has come in your flesh that's what he's referring to right because what does he say greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world that's the spirit right the spirit that's in you is what's what's showing that Jesus Christ Has Come In the Flesh what spirit is in you right what did Jesus say I'll be with you even in you who's the comforter that would come to you right the the the message of the hour has come to restore an indwelling of the Holy Spirit back into the people it's a restoration of Christ back into the people right and when things would come anything that would come between you and the indwelling of Christ with into you that is the spirit of antichrist anything that would come against you and say that that's a false thing that is a spirit of antichrist because it is it is contrary to Christ coming in the flesh right that this this um and and that would be the that would be the the that would be the great um uh deception of the age right that would be the great lie at this end time that would put the incarnation of Christ in the flesh is something that happened a couple thousand years ago and not something that's current now not something that's available to people now right that's what would you know you know we live in a day where we have a promise that Christ can is on the Earth again right the the entire message of the hour is hinged on that one concept everything is hinged on that and so often Our Lives you know that's what the devil tries to do you know with with every struggle it seems like that we that we have is a um every trial every every uh when the devil tries to come against you spiritually it's always to hinder that key component right to either either stifle the spirit moving in your life through distraction through um through uh you know know stress hardship you know it seems like every you know I I I brother uh Caleb asked me if I could cover for him the Sunday he was actually scheduled to to do Sunday school and I I said yes and then the next day everything went to pieces you know the you know the you know everything goes sideways you know I'm you know back to back to back to back why because the devil's trying to to you know flood the Zone with with distractions and problems that I've got to deal with why because he's trying to hinder something right he's trying to hinder someone to be encouraged he's trying to he's trying to create so many potholes that you can't move forward or he'll just give you something that that that uh you know is going to take up your time he's going to try to you know siphon up your time with social media or or whatever or he's going to try to you know attack your attack you mentally give you some sort of depression or give you some sort of anx xiety that you're constantly dealing with that that you can't you know hold to a promise because you know you're all in your own feelings about something that you did or said or whatever you know everything is always to hinder the recognition that Christ is in you and trying to do something right that is uh like the number one uh problem that we deal with in this age and anything that is going against you that is trying to shut you down and not let the spirit of Christ move in your life that is the Antichrist by definition it is the opposite of Christ it is inhibiting Christ right which and the other side of it is if you really look into what the word Antichrist means doesn't necessarily mean opposite of it really if you get the heart of what it means it means a substitute for right does not Antichrist is not necess necessarily the opposite of Christ it is the substitute for Christ right it is not Christ but it assuages the conscience in your head that tells you you need Christ right and you know that's what that's what the whole world is being flooded with is um you know especially in this day and age where it seems like there's this massive uptick in you know Uprising in spiritual awareness you know huge numbers of people are recognizing that the you know uh you need you need some sort of Christian values to hold the world together right you know to hold Society together well you know we we're going to be good people and you know we're going to we're going to make America uh a a a moral country again and America is going to be was great when it was Christian and we're going to make America Christian again and they will do it in name only right they will they will have a lot of people going to church a lot of people go to church and I and a lot of people who go to church are not Christians am right because they've they've they have a form right they they do all the things that look like Christianity they do all the things that look like Christ they do all the Commandments right they keep all these Commandments do a lot of good works but there's no actual indwelling there's nothing because when it comes down to when somebody says you know the whole thing of like well you know I'm a good person usually what that is associated with the other statement that's attached to is I have this problem I have this thing I don't want to give up I have this one Crystal prized thing that you can't claw out of my hands right but I'm a good person I'll make it on that you know what it was every single person who followed Jesus had something right it was they had some dream they had some ambition they had something right and in this day and age everybody's got something and what when Jesus spoke to the rich rich young ruler and told him to sell everything that he had and follow him what it boiled down to was it it wasn't necessarily his wealth in particular it was just that particular to him it was wealth right there there are Christians who can have money but I guarantee you the real genuine Christians who have wealth will not not cling to it and put it between them and Christ right they if if God told them if if the Lord spoke to them and told them to sell it all off and and be a popper they do it in a heartbeat right and anybody who wouldn't well then that's that's what's the stumbling block right it doesn't have to be wealth it could be anything it could be your job you know I'm you know I'm I'm you know I just I want to be a businessman I have this dream of growing my business and I'm going to be a great businessman and I'm going to have this awesome I just got to work 80 hours a week stay out of church and never be a father to my kids you know I could you know I'm not going to be in the position because what did he tell him he said take up your cross and follow me well the cross Jesus wasn't crucified yet to the average person that doesn't speak to at that time when Jesus said that the cross meant nothing other than a public form of execution yeah a humiliating form of execution at that when he's talking about taking up a cross only people who took up crosses were the people who were humiliated publicly and publicly executed right to to Bear a cross was basically saying are you willing to publicly humiliate yourself to sell off all the comfort that you have sell off your status as a wealthy man of power burn it all to the ground and then go sleep on the side of the street with me and my followers are you willing to instead of stepping over that beggar every morning on the way to the market are you willing to go make your bed next to him and that's what he wouldn't give up I I can't do it and he and again he started this conversation by saying you called me good you know that only applies to God do you mean what you just said and the Rich Young Ruler did not correct him he knew exactly who he was talking to he knew full well he was talking to God in flesh and he and he and he turned down the opportunity because he had something he couldn't give up and so many people that have something they can't give up they got something they they just will not let it go and you know uh you know well I you know I okay so I have this thing that I just won't let go of but I'm a good person I go to church I go to a message Church you know I read I read brother brandom and listen to tapes you know I'm a good person if there's something that you will not give up then you will never you will never have a true indwelling of Jehovah inside of you you will never have that and the fact of the matter is good people do go to heaven the problem is the measuring stick for how we determine good is God until you measure up to God no you are not good good people do go to heaven you just will never attain it out in your own doing the only way is to have the that good God dwelling inside of you that's it amen and we're out of time let's let's stand father Lord I I thank you for this opportunity to deliver the burden of My Heart Lord and maybe somebody would have been encouraged father to encourage that they would know that Lord that it is you dwelling inside of them and that it would not be some works that their faults or their failures would not be the determining factor in in in their salvation Lord but it would be that they would cling to you and that they would they would always hold to that salvation that you would offer Lord father that we would be have a a true Revelation that Lord if we would give it up whatever it is that would be in our hearts Lord that would hinder us Lord that if we would just give it up that father you would have something better for us there would always be better something better for us that you would never ask us to give up a treasure unless you had another treasure waiting for us that would be even better so father we ask that you would be with us through the service that you would the remainder of the service that you would go with us throughout the day Watching Over Us and keeping us that the people would be encouraged father I ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
