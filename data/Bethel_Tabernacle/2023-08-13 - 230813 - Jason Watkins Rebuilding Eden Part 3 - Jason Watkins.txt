so many families who are away right now several families overseas and other different ones traveling so um but we're here and the Lord is here and so I'm just looking for what he has amen praise the Lord we're going to invite you right to the Book of James chapter one we're continuing on by the grace of God uh in our little series called rebuilding Eden I would like to say I do have one prayer request to take for sister Phyllis who has an unspoken request and she lost her keys this morning so we're gonna pray that the holy spirit will uh no way is that Terry my goodness wow Terry oh my good to see you buddy praise the Lord amen I'm excellent better now praise God happy to have you here today this uh for all of you all who don't know the back story uh this this young man grew up with our kids and his mom and dad and uh where uh my his dad and and myself um are related and and and distant cousins but we grew up together and I haven't seen him in a long time praise the Lord amen if you ever heard me tell the story of the little three-year-old that I wore out for climbing on a dresser and thought it was Chris it turned out to be Terry assistant it was you're right he's the one who started it Terry Chris you owe him quite a bit and then I had to repent to his parents and uh they of course his dad thought it was funny he said well he probably needed it amen praise the lord well we're happy to have you here good to see you amen so um I wanted also to to just say I I actually had it on my schedule for Wednesday and it got past me and then I was actually glad that I could wait till Sunday when more of you were here I just wanted to express how much sister Debbie now when those cards that you got and the birthday and the cake and the celebration and and the the trickery that um sister Hannah pulled on me amen LED astray by a little girl and uh she led me right into the Trap amen and so we're happy I just wanted to say how much I appreciate that it really warmed my heart sister Debbie as well so thank you and God bless you amen James chapter one we're just going to catch a couple of verses and then we're going to go right to Matthew chapter 12. James chapter 1 verses 17 and 18. every good gift and every perfect gift is from above you get anything good and perfect it come from God because Satan is just a perverter and he's he has one motive and that's to destroy all right every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness no neither shadow of turning so I've expressed to you many times that this is a great testimony to Hebrews 13 and 8 that Jesus Christ is the same all the time yesterday today and forever he he does it as we've as we've said rather humorously he doesn't wake up on the wrong side of the bed he doesn't wake up in a bad mood he doesn't have a bad hair day he's always amicable he's always Fair he's always warm-hearted he's always full of love he's always trying to help always the Bible says that his throne is established in Mercy say well but wow I've got a pretty bad track record surely he can't love me but the Bible says that that Mercy rejoiceth against judgment see so so just um just be aware of that look at this second verse 9 verse 18. of his own will of his own will beget he us with the word of Truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures so the way he gets you to be like him which is why you were built the whole purpose of life and the Earth is for God to have a kingdom amen and he's going to have a kingdom of saints that are like him and you were born the opposite of him so the way he's going to get you back to being like him he's going to send his word you're going to believe it it's going to create a new birth experience in you and then your life will start turning around and you'll start being like him and and on Resurrection morning you'll be exactly like him even to even you have a body like his glorified body amen so um these verses um tell us I want you to notice before I let you be seated and I'll read my second text with you seated but just catch this now so these verses tell us a little bit about him right every good gift is from him every perfect gift is from him he has no variables he has no shadow of turning right it tells us a little bit about him it also tells us some of his intentions to save us for his kingdom he says here he's going to be goddess with the word of truths so that we can be kind of like first fruits of his creation like offspring you see so and then and then we finally realize that they not only tell us a little bit about him and his intentions to save us for his kingdom but it tells us a little bit about what we will be seen as by him you will be viewed as his offspring wow that you you there's no better deal in the in the universe than that than to be considered The Offspring of God you've heard me say it many times uh maybe I'll say it for the sake of our visitors our future is bright friends our future is bright is it any wonder that once you get this little small window uh into into what's been and what lays ahead my no wonder we can love him the way we do let's pray father we thank you for your word that's been read this morning I'm committing myself Lord to your anointing there's once again this is just a series that I'm going through step by step as I feel led of the Holy Spirit it'd be impossible to get it all today not even a chance of that so we just want to try to get the portion that you want for today so I committed to you Lord completely into your hands take take this vessel take the preacher take the hearers take every Spirit under your control for the glory of God may you help sister Phyllis find her keys today may you bless her in the unspoken request that she has today May It Be So Lord we ask big of thee in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated and we're going to turn to Matthew chapter 12. now I'm definitely going to I'm reading both of these passages for my opening text I don't think I will really get to the substance of this second text but per Adventure I do and it goes faster than I think then I want to go ahead I don't want to have to read it um down down the path Matthew chapter 12 verses 38 to 42. then certain of the scribes and the Pharisees answered saying Master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet Jonah now I want you to catch something here it's not it's not unusual for people to want to see the supernatural That's Not Unusual and God very often times brings forth the supernatural but remember that the the supernatural that we cease signs and wonders and miracles he's always done that but that's never really the proof of God that's just evidence it's evidence it and it accumulates and and you have an accumulative uh idea IDE idea that God must be true he must be real because I see Supernatural things that are happening in front of me that aren't natural they're super natural they can't happen in nature the laws of physics even in the quantum world would not allow what I'm seeing therefore it must be something even beyond that and a lot of times mankind Humanity doesn't know what it is they think maybe there's some energy up there there's some being they're not sure what it is some of them don't believe in a being at all they believe this is it I find that to be a heartbreakingly sad way to look at life my goodness if if this is it then why in the world did I even come here because all you all you do is you're born and job said you're a man born of a woman is just a few days and full of trouble you can look on the streets and look in the headlines and this ain't a world uh that that's a very good place it has a lot of good people in it but I'm glad that God's going to take it back over and turn it back into a good place so I'm glad to know that there's something uh after this world as as you've heard you know many times I'm in preaching funerals and you take that scripture where Jesus said you know you've believed in God believe in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it weren't so I would just tell you the truth I'm just that honest that's what Jesus is saying I'm just honest if this wasn't true if I was tricking you I would just own it I would just tell you but what I'm telling you is is there's a world out there and I'm going to prepare it so that when you get there and oh yes you're going to get there see and so that where I am you can be also and and and brother Branham is saying how he says Jesus what Jesus is saying to his disciples is that this life is not ended in death that there's a there's a whole nother life after this life is over that is a continuation of this same life in another world which actually is just another dimension because heaven is going to be right here on this Earth the Bible makes that very clear only it won't be under the rule of man it'll be back under the rulership of God's word so we we find him here saying to these people you're going to read here in verse 39 he answered to them and said an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign but there won't be a sign given it except Jonah now what made Jonah A Sign was because it was a fulfillment of the word Jesus wasn't there to be a circus act for them he wasn't there to clown for them and and you know and and he went about Healing The Sick only because he had a kind heart and he came and he said the the the the healthy don't need a physician but it's the sick they said why do you go among Sinners he said because it's the Sinners who need me see and so so we find that he went about the Bible says doing good what was he doing he was showing the love of God see so so we find he says but but if you if you won't take the Fulfillment of the word as the sign and all you want me to do is do some magic tricks for you you're evil you're evil if all you're doing is chasing after you know uh spectacular things that can tantalize your mind but you refuse when I have showed you my word and I fulfilled my word and it even came to pass in your day and you don't you won't receive that and then you want me to do a magic trick you're evil that's an evil heart he says for as Jonah verse 40 was three days and nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth see and so when I read that that he's saying the son of man will be this amount of time in the heart of the Earth you've never attended a funeral in all your life where you expected the person to just be there for three days I've never preached one I've never went to one where everybody said okay three days from now but Jesus is saying here three days and that's it I'll be back see so why am I a Christian today because he said he would do it and he did say how do you know he rose cause I met him he lives inside me changed my whole heart changed my whole mind changed my whole life watch as he goes on verse 41 the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment see that's why it's such Folly it is such Folly these people running around you know trying to believe or disbelieve the sign and the sign to to be believed is the word of God being fulfilled what God said he would do he said how the world would be at the end he said this is what I'll do right before I destroy it and he did it and we have it so they can argue about a bridge and a cloud and a bear all they want to that's just evidence but I I already have the proof of what he has done in this day changed my life changed my world the men of Nineveh now watch this now here's here's what he's going to say to these evil-hearted people who he was the word fulfilled he was Isaiah's prophecy and they're refusing it they're wanting a magic trick Isaiah had told him what would happen and here he is and they're not accepting it and he says to them the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah they were they were heathens and here's Israelites who are supposed to be God's people as as brother Adam said the the most holy City with the most holy people took the most holy person and gave him the most cruel death he says the men the men of Nineveh shall rise and judge you see because they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold a greater than Jonah is here speaking of himself a greater than Jonah's here and you're still not believing it and heathens believed a lesser version verse 42 the queen of the South this is the Queen of Sheba the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the Earth this queen of the South she came from the uttermost parts of the Earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here so you know at the at the beginning of of part two in this series today is part three in fact at the beginning of part two uh we found ourselves looking back in time we went way back we went way back further than Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God created the heavens Earth we went back beyond that say does the bible take us there sure John 1 takes us back in the beginning was the word it was with God and was God and we we found way back there that before there was an earth before there were stars before there were galaxies or anything there was God we found that that great eternal spirit that filled all time space and Eternity and and here in our day the prophet described God in that in that way back period he used a metaphor so that we as humans could try to get our mind wrapped around wow what does that even mean this great being that predated stars and galaxies and space and and he filled all time space and Eternity how do you even get your mind around that well you can't fully because you're this this right here is in a finite condition and you won't be able to fully comprehend who he is and even who you are and how the relation works until we cross to the other side the Bible says then we'll know as we're known so so here we it's a walk of faith we have to walk by faith Jesus had to do that in fact is Jesus was a faithful high priest now what made him a faithful high priest because in always tempted as we were as we are he was he was he had to literally endure everything that you and I have to endure so that he could know what it feels like as a mortal as a man God came down and became a man Jesus wasn't a second person in the godhead that's ancient Babylonian polytheism he never was that it's all wrapped up in expression but he God became a man and walked the Earth and felt what it feels like to get sick to get lonely to be rejected to have his feelings hurt he felt what it feels like to have love and then to lose someone you love he felt Jesus as a human felt what it felt like to not know what tomorrow holds he had to walk just like you only knowing who holds tomorrow see he says that all through the scripture you find that brother I'm taught that very clearly you know he he he's walking through a crowd and the woman with a blood issue she's had it for years and no doctor can help her and she slips in because she said in her heart if I can just Touch the Hem of His Garment and there's no way he would have felt that she didn't tug on it she didn't grab it she just touched it and it hung loose from his body and it was even an outer layer it's impossible for a human to feel that and he didn't feel her physical touch on his on His Garment but he felt strength go out of his body he felt himself getting weak and he knew somebody had contacted his father and had Drew healing out of him oh my because why he was a fountain of healing and he turns around and he says who touched me and brother Brandon points out two things he said first of all he didn't know who touched him second of all and he didn't know until the woman came trembling forward and revealed her own self and then he didn't know what was wrong with her until others showed him and he says I do everything by Vision the son does nothing but what he sees the father doing Jesus so God intentionally limited his own self and his Humanity remember remember that he he who thought it he thought it not to be robbery to say I am God I'm equal to God if you see God you see me the one who didn't think that was robbery laid aside his Splendor in heaven and came down Paul said and took the form of a servant and became a man among us and there he walked and he had to walk daily and and from his Humanity God hid and and he had to get a download every day on what to do even even after his resurrection he comes to the Mount and they they want to know about the coming of the Lord and the restoration of Israel and Jesus you know in one place in the gospels when he's talking about that he says now of that day no man noeth not even the son even I don't know it and when they ask him on the mountain well you're now will you now restore the he said now that's just in God's hands I that that's that's not for you to know I don't even know myself only God alone has that but but we find that when he ascended and he went from living in a human body even glorified that body got laid on The Mercy Seat so that there's a Perpetual atonement for you and me that even if I make a failure God is only looking at My Sacrifice he doesn't see my failure Hallelujah and but when he went back he said I come from God I go back to God in other words when he went from a human back to being the pillar of fire that met Paul on the road to Damascus and said I'm Jesus and it was a pillar of fire it went back to that one that led Israel through the Wilderness who met Moses in a burning bush and now he can come to John on the Isle of patmans and he can give him the whole revelation of everything that's going to happen because now he knows everything makes clear and who is this Melchizedek he bypassed theophany he says now I mean he came from theophany to word he said you bypass that because in that form he note all things but not in his human form and therefore that's why the Bible you know I think it's John or is it Peter I don't remember said that we have known Christ in the flesh but henceforth know we him no longer now he's went back to the pillar of Fire and the responsibility to be the word made flesh is now transferred to his church to his bride the voice the voice of God in the earth now that that that that word made flesh is in a many-membered pride friends it is humbling and difficult to get your mind around that you walk around here today with knowledge of of the events of the world and knowledge of the coming of the Lord that even Jesus though he knows now but in his Earthly Ministry he didn't even know you know more now than he knew then that that's blasphemous in some circles but that's what the Bible shows us this has now been what kind of responsibility do we have that the mysteries of the Kingdom have been entrusted to us say oh I want to write it in a book and go put it in a cave somewhere no don't write it behind skin and be the Living Word to the last age oh I hope you're catching that so so we find that brother Branham is trying to describe how how would a prophet who can see through prophetic lenses and understand things and doesn't tell us everything he said God doesn't tell His prophets everything and Prophets don't tell the people everything he said many times God will tell me and show me stuff he said I can't say anything about it but here's a case where he was given Liberty to describe what God is like back in the eternities before he was a man before he was a pillar of Fire before there was anything there was just God Alone with his thoughts and the closest that he could use as a metaphor is to describe and he described we read it last time in part two he described it like a great fountain way back in the eternities and out of this great Fountain we we found that you know it it it it it it it it was it flowed everything good flowed out of it you know as as this being flowed pure love and and pure truth and pure joy uncut uncontaminated Joy uncontaminated uh truth pure truth pure honesty pure loyalty ever no wonder no wonder James would say in our text oh good gifts and all perfect gifts come down from him who is above they flow down to us from that great Eternal Fountain who then took the form of a pillar of fire and began to whirl and now here he is as a pillar of fire and a prophet said something that could now be seen actually seen physically but at the time that he whirls himself into the pillar of fire to be seen there's still yet nothing to see him and so in that form of the office of sun not us not a son like I have a son who's separate from me it's simply that God transferred himself from that great spirit into a form and you could see it and and therefore it took the title The designation not in English like we think of an offspring a son that's not what Jesus was Jesus was the very God into a form and in that form of the pillar of fire his entire family already existed and down Through the Ages he would Express them into Earth and when they got there it looked like Adam and it looked like an Abel and it looked like a Seth looked like an Abraham looked like a Noah looked like a Moses it was in Isaiah was it Ezekiel it was a David it was a Solomon it was John it was Jesus it was Matthew Mark Luke and John hallelujah it's Luther it's Wesley it's it's Azusa it's the Bride of the last day and here we are friends and you're The Offspring of what God had in his mind before the foundation of the world you're guaranteed not to hear that on the average Sunday morning and we wouldn't know a thing about it if it hadn't been for a prophet in our day so he's describing him in this way but this great fountain alone with his thoughts and the prophet goes on to describe him as lonely was lonely he wanted a family every young man knows that feeling wanted wanted something it's it and and it's hard to you know you you you you want a companion in life you start longing young men you know I can see them grow up and I dedicate them as babies and I baptize them as young men and I watch them grow and they're they're like this one-dimensional person until one day they come to see me and they they got a whole different kind of approach now you know I want you to pray I'm thinking and they're they're starting to respond I want a companion I want a mate I I wanna I want to expand I want to extend I want to be more and it's not all about having more it's about being more my wife isn't she she's what makes me more because they too have become one flesh and so the strength I can't get sidetracked on that today I was almost hit this morning studying got a whole bunch of notes we'll catch we'll get to it in our family series that we're doing on the first Wednesday of each month but the whole synergetic effect there and Synergy is quite a phenomenon and uh in physics and so it just means that the two combined or then they're greater and they're stronger and they're more than the sum of their individual parts or you would say you know 10 plus 10 is 20 but by the time you put them together it's it's 40 and 100 and 200 and 500 and a thousand say where'd this how'd this see and then and and science actually contract that they they know that one horse can pull this much weight but put a second horse with him and team them together and if you train them to step together and pull in harmony they can TR they can pull now up to three times what the what they could have pulled in to be saying oh there are only two of them how did it go three times that Synergy see and so and that's science can actually list why it's working that way because now you got four Hooves on the ground you got more traction you you've got you've got more pull you've got more pull from a central tie that goes to the weight there's all kinds of of scientific things I'm not here to break it down today but by the time you take that into the supernatural then it's one will chase a thousand and two ten thousand see so it goes off the scale once you once you get let God have a hold of it let God have a hold of your life I promise you you'll have a life like you never imagined more than you could ever accomplish on your own if you just let him have your have control of your life so he's lonely he wanted a family I gotta hurry he wanted to share his eternal life with someone so he comes to Genesis 1 and and there God now moving out in his plan what is he doing Genesis 1 1 Let There Be he says and God created the heavens and the Earth that's not God just killing time that's not God just playing around he's not just experimenting in a laboratory he's fulfilling a vision from within himself see when I when I decided I wanted to have my wife I wasn't playing games I I'm serious and my request will you marry me and I I that meant to me and when my mom asked me why do you want to marry her she knew I loved her I'd been dating her for three and a half years she said on our wedding day we're driving my mom is driving beside I'm driving she's riding beside me I just want to hear it I want to hear you say it why do you want to marry Debbie and I thought about it for a moment and I said because I'm tired of taking her home and I meant that so sincerely I didn't want to back out of her driveway and wave at her see tomorrow or next Sunday or I was done with that I wanted her with me all the time everywhere I wanted to be more than I was and this is what God was doing when he was lonely but he wanted a family he wanted to share his eternal life with someone and so he comes to Genesis 1 and God created the heavens and the Earth but we found in our last study Wednesday if you weren't here or just for your benefit we found that when he said when he created the heavens and the Earth though he found that the world was void and it was and it was in chaos and darkness covered the face of the demon Prophet said it was just chaotic just just chaos everywhere there was there was no semblance it was anything but a beautiful garden was everything the opposite of that but it was a start and we find that he comes forward from his throne now he's not just satisfied to say I'll create it let there be an earth Let There Be Heavens but he's not just satisfied with that now he's going to take the next step and he from his throne he calls to the Earth let there be light you see when he saved you he didn't save you to leave you like you are he saved you to change you and lift you up above the Shadows of the sinful world you live in and someday set you as his peculiar treasure in a brand new world and so what is it what is daily Christianity about is daily Christianity this building hospitals and schools and feeding babies and kissing babies that's that's fine that's we we show the world that we care but my my daily life under God as I'm being grown I'm being raised I'm being trained I'm being taught I'm being I'm being uh manifested and when this whole bride around the world and that last name on his book is called and they're all manifested we're going home Hallelujah so he says let there be light he's still doing that today he's still commanding light to be born in your life light drives out darkness and that's what the new birth is about if if the new birth that you claim you have has not driven the darkness from your heart the new birth you think you have is a mirage I don't say that hurts your feelings and say that to help you this is a warning collection Danger [Laughter] the enemy what do I do let Christ have control of your life see he's not interested in just church goers the devil's a church goer he's trying to change people's whole nature and so we came and we found that he he built a beautiful garden in this Garden he had placed his son and his son's wife and it was beautiful it was perfect it was flawless I I it's it astonishes me when people look at the broken world today whom they broke in are breaking and somehow want to blame God for that why does God let this happen why does God let that he was a real God he had stopped us if he was a real God he'd stop that whoa hold on when God made it it was perfect when God finished it he rested and everything he said it was all good it was mankind who broke the world and today is still breaking it see God's going to put it back together but he he didn't want a kingdom of robots and Androids he doesn't want AI you understand he wants a family I didn't I didn't marry a robot I married a woman who would share my Visions who thought like me who desired like me who Who Loved God like me oh my and this is this that's why Paul said that the human marriage is just simply a scaled down version of what God did God that's his whole plan see that's why you you understand that God had better if you understand it as husband and wife instead of father son father son is true but it can be confusing because then you know especially for English-speaking people Sun sounds like a separate person but but but it's it's always been husband and wife and they too shall be one see all right so when we when we last viewed the garden scene this beautiful world this perfect Eden as we looked on it last Wednesday we found that God's perfect Eden had become a catastrophe a catastrophe sin had found its way in and his family his son Adam and his Adam's wife Eve had made a dreadful mistake and and now his son has fallen we showed you last time we'll talk about a little bit again Eve couldn't bring the world down her sin didn't do that her sin didn't even open her eyes what she had done and she's still with Glee bringing it to Adam to show him look what I found it was Adam who knew what the problem was it was Adam who knew what this meant he had two choices I could let her go and she'll die with the world or I can save her because I know God can't kill me because I'm his son and if he would kill me that's kill himself see and therefore I love this woman and so I'm going to step into sin with her and protect her see he did that out of love for Eve the Earth had become a catastrophe Eve the mother of all living seduced and tricked by Satan had indirectly brought about the downfall of all life on Earth and as I said at the start she didn't she didn't believe that what she was doing was wrong and and when the even when the deed was done she she didn't know even what she had done she didn't realize that she was in grave peril she'd come back to Adam happy she didn't know she was at that moment between life and death and that this Peril as if that's not bad enough it was unrecoverable you understand there it was unrecoverable by any Act of repentance that she could perform there was no amount of reparations that she could pay it was irreversible and unrecoverable by her she had no way to bring herself back from Doom now there's a reason for that there's a reason why it had only Adam could do that and not Eve only Adam could provide the solution Eve couldn't there was nothing she could do she was helpless and hopeless so a little bit about how she got in this condition and how Satan so easily misled her just like the Bible says lay aside the weights and sins that so easily beset you so that you can run the race with race with patience we find that the Bible shows us in Genesis that that before she was expressed as a human in the garden the Bible shows us that she had a pre-existence inside Adam she was in Adam just like Christ the son of God was God and when he expressed himself he came from one point to something else and in that Pillar of Fire his entire family Eve was there listen there as I've said to you before Isaiah 42 shows us there is only one elected son and that's Christ he's the only elected son how did I get elected because I was in him before the foundation of the world that's the only way see and so so we find that that before she was expressed as a human the Bible shows us that she existed within Adam and this is exactly why when God made them he called their name Adam when he made them he called their plural plural name Adam because if there was only one expression and that was Adam and so as Adam goes along he looks at nature he sees all the animal kingdom and everybody's got a mate but he looked all among the creation of God and he couldn't find one like him and and the and the laws of God don't allow for cross-breeding every seed had to bring forth of its kind so there was so that that that means that that while there is absolutely such a thing as Bible Evolution Charles Darwin missed that key point God did use Evolution but not crossing the species every seed brought forth of its kind uh every that's why when you go back I asked my science teacher that time sister mom uh I I I my my Bible teacher and I said Mom my science teacher ninth ninth grade 10th grade I don't remember he's a he's an evolutionist what can I say she says go ask him why did it stop I said well what does that even mean she said well go to the most ancient cave paintings they can find that they claim are millions of years old and and man is painted on there with ten fingers and ten toes and a nose on the front and two ears on the side and eyes right here and a mouth right here and he walks around upright and he can he can shoot a bow and Hunt animals and and and if evolution brought him to that then why did it suddenly stop what did you go on vacation by now he should have you know 40 toes and and 38 fingers and he should be you know he should have two heads so he can think more clearly you know why why did it stop if evolution brought him from a tadpole why'd it stop yeah well I didn't have an answer neither did my science teacher well I gotta get to my next class here still waiting on that answer but God did didn't use a form of evolution he evoluted up he first he started out with the the Sea and the creatures and the water and the whales and different things and then he then he starts making cows and horses and dogs and all he starts coming up at polluting higher and higher and higher until he gets to a man now a man is made in His image see and so so we find then that that if man was going to have a mate she would also have to be in His image and if he was in God then she would be in him and so he put Adam to sleep and opened up his side just like Jesus had his side open to Calvary because he was the second Adam and he took Eve out of her out and then he made a body and now she's standing side by side and Adam can look at her and hold her and embrace her and they're sweethearts so she had her being within the original creation that is to say I know brother M talks about all the time she wasn't in the original creation that's true but you have to qualify that by everything he said that of course she was she she had her being within the original creation that is to say she was in Adam and she was real and she existed see but she had not been a part of the original manifestation In the Flesh you understand when God manifested everything on Earth she was not there and Adam's looking around where she at where's my mate and God says well he's lonely God knew what that felt like I was lonely my son is lonely I'll put him in a deep sleep I'll take her out of him and stand her up beside him and it was beautiful was genius it was masterpiece now he's got a family now he's a little further in his great plan because now he's going to start from here and it's going to multiply he told them multiply multiply replenish the Earth replenish the Earth because he he's now starting it's kicked off it's underway he's headed toward making a kingdom and then Satan Moves In and so we find that in this sense coming out of Adam she became a byproduct of God's Wonder working power you know to to solve Adam's loneliness and to make them Complete because neither one of them were in that condition and a byproduct you know sometimes that I don't know why men want to stand on that sometimes to you know strut their dominance over their wife and treat her like a doormat that was nothing like that in the Garden of Eden they stood equally before God and worshiped God I get that the fall came and her desire would be to her husband I understand that we're not arguing that her place uh you know but she has a place and she's valuable you say well yeah but she's a byproduct byproducts are amazing listen you know what photosynthesis is photosynthesis it's a byproduct of carbon dioxide try to live without photosynthesis photosynthesis photosynthesis do you know what it's byproduct is you're breathing it oxygen is that a bad thing I'd say auction is a pretty good thing I'm pretty sure I need it so I would have to say Lord keep the carbon dioxide coming so photosynthesis can take place so oxygen can be released so I can live nitrogen that's a that's a that's a byproduct all all of these different things I mean I I have a whole list that I that I'm just trying to show you William Brandon was never trying to down women that's a misunderstanding and that's that's men who don't love their wives correctly try to stand on that was God never intended for it to be that way never see so it's it's just simply a prophet explaining how she got here and what position that put her in see and so she she she has her beginning she existed in him she's later expressed in the flesh she's taken out of Adam in this sense she's a byproduct but but she's a byproduct of God's Wonder working machinery she's a byproduct of his Machinery to help Adam's loneliness the byproduct was a wife see so so but as such not being manifested in the original sequence of creation she couldn't redeem herself from sin there's the real catch she couldn't since she came that way since she was not a direct creation of the spoken word of God like Adam was she came subsequently to the sequence of creation so now she cannot redeem herself from sin so much like it is today friends we find ourselves in the exact same position unable to save ourselves from sin and death I had no way to save myself I was born in sin I was headed for hell I had no chance to save myself we come into this world lost amen where we come cut off from God we come with a fallen nature we're unable to trade I can't trade my death for life but there was one who could save her Hallelujah there was one who could save you and who could save me the first Adam saved her the second Adam saved you and I oh there would come one to save her just as I found one who could save me that day a second Adam of Christ and I'm here to taste something you can find that same savior today you can you can't save yourself good works won't do it you'll never get there your best efforts are nothing to they're they're God it's not that God doesn't appreciate good works but he can only the only life that God can can have in his presence is his own life because he's so pure nothing less than his own life can can be in front of him so the great and beautiful Plan of Redemption is God came down as a man and swapped life with you and me and I got his life and he took my life and paid the price and I get the reward imagine that he paid the price and I get the reward wow how could you not love him how could I not love him how could the whole world not love him universally a single worthy one who could take our place in judgment and set us free in her beauty and in her innocence thinking she had accomplished a great thing I'm not going to go a whole lot longer yeah tons more but I'm just going to get to a point and stop in her innocence thinking when she went along with the Serpent's lie as Paul said she was seduced by the devil but thinking that she had accomplished a great thing she desired to share it with the man she loved her Adam she had lost sight of the fact here's where we were last Wednesday she had lost sight of the fact that the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and the Tree of Life stood side by side in the Garden of Eden now brother Branham shows in the scripture unmistakably you have to just be willfully blind you have to deny so many Bible verses you go into John's gospel you go into John's letters he's the one who always is writing about love and always about you know he was the light and the life of men and the love of God and God is love and all these different things and and John shows in his in the gospels he shows in his Epistles that the only source of eternal life is Jesus John makes that clear there is no other source there never has been another source of life except Christ and and Christ that we're you know we're not talking about just limited to the baby born in a manger we're talking about the one who created the whole world Paul said he created All Things by Jesus Christ John said that in the beginning was the word it was God was with God and was God it was made flesh and and and through him God created all things that are everything that is was created by Him and for him see don't get trapped up in his Humanity thinking he's lost somehow less than these same Eternal being he's the exact same Eternal being only now living as a man so that he can take the curse of sin into his body on your behalf so that he could be judged of God guilty and sent to hell so you would never have to go because he knew if you went to hell you couldn't get out he knew if he did he could get out easy he could walk right down to the devil smack him down take the keys loose the prisoners Ascend right up out of hell and nothing could stop him took him right into the throne room if God walked him right down Glory Lane made a turn on Hallelujah Avenue and and pulled right up to the throne and said father all these Old Testament Saints are yours and so so we find that that that the prophet shows so if that's true and countless scriptures show and prove that Jesus is life he's the only source therefore if you're seeing a tree of life in the garden you cannot escape the conclusion that it was a person it wasn't a tree like a kid would climb was a person it was Christ once you understand that then you realize good grief then the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was also a person who was it Satan say Satan are you kidding me he was in the garden go read Ezekiel where Ezekiel says that thou Lucifer was in Eden you were in Eden you were there and all your beauty and so Satan seduces Eve through vicariously because he can't bring life like God so he he inhabits a beast that was more cunning than any other beast called The Serpent who walked upright and talked it wasn't a snake when's the last time a snake talked to you or reasoned with you that's ridiculous you know sometimes people have to say good grief come up out of your Sunday school little kid's mind and read the scriptures correctly and and he was an upright he was more cunning and subtle than any Beast walked around looked like a man it was that Missing Link science tried to find him they can't find him the closest link they've got is a champ to a man and they go how did we get from here to here there's something missing they'll never find him God cursed his body took his legs and arms off of him put him on the ground see and so so you realize that vicariously through the serpent he's he takes Eve in seduction and then and then she's she's pregnant with twins how'd that happen not eating an apple she's pregnant with twins and one's a uh the Son of God and one's the son of the devil the Bible makes that very clear constantly scripture after scripture after scripture I'm not here to preach on the original sin today I'm trying to get I'm trying to get to this last point before I close but we find that through the cunning of the serpent he had persuaded Eve that the tree of knowledge was the tree to be desired and she said that she said the Bible says when she saw that it was good for food and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took see and he's doing the same thing today he whispers in your ears your young people especially he whispers in your ears the same way he did Eve trying trying to persuade Eve that that the tree of knowledge is the way to go that's the tree to be desired the world is your oyster Eve the world is your oyster you you can have whatever you want you can have fortune and Glory you you can you can have wealth and pleasure and and this seduction of Eve devastated all creation it destroyed Adam's happy home it'll destroy your home too it'll destroy your home listen husbands and wives you owe loyalty to one another children you owe loyalty to your parents this uh one thing I have to constantly tell teenagers this thing is bigger than you this ain't all about you get out of your selfishness and care about your family who loves you because if the devil can ruin you he can tarnish them hallelujah we're all in this thing together friends Hallelujah it destroyed Adam's happy home his blessed life as a minor god of the earth which is what he was for when Adam in his great love moved to save her he fell with her and when Adam fell since he was the top of creation everything under him fell all nature collapsed it required her Adam the first Adam to move for her in a way that revealed to her her falling condition I'm going to say that again that's a big point Eve came back from her illicit Affair still not knowing it was wrong not even knowing she was naked her Consciousness still hadn't been hadn't been undone she comes back to tell him all about it but when Adam took her and moved it took in other words it took Adam to show to her the Peril she was in and the dire situation she was in and that she was doomed and the only decision now to be made is does he sacrifice himself and all creation to save her I'm here to tell you he did and the second Adam did he left his throne in glory he came down and sacrificed everything and stood in judgment not to just die for you as brother Dale Smith says but to die instead of you Hallelujah he died he didn't have to do it Adam didn't have to do it but but literally the whole world was broken when Adam saved her life when the serpent brought her the knowledge still none the wiser but when Adam brought her the same knowledge she understood in that moment that she was now in a fallen condition and sinful she knew then the painful truth she was lost she couldn't save herself and she realized that what Adam had just done to save her life literally he took her penalty upon himself and stood for her in judgment that friends is what the second Adam did for you and me it took him moving I didn't I was like Paul I didn't know I was a sinner I thought I was a good guy I was raised in a good home I was a good old boy I didn't cheat on people I didn't lie I was noble I I was a friend to all men I walked around in the earth and and I would have never known that I was dying I had heard the story since a boy and I thought I was fine but it took the second Adam it took the second Adam coming to me to say I love you but you're you're not alive yet you're still dying you're you're born in sin and you're gone it doesn't matter how good you are or how good you think you are how many Good Deeds you can perform you need to let me come in you need to let me come in and take out your old sinful life and replace your life with my life I've never been so happy friends to raise up my hands and surrender and say yay Lord come in and take the old me take it all take everything of me away I I want to be like you I want to be in heaven I want to have that home I want to have that Lord I Lord I I desire Purity I desire Holiness I'm searching for truth I'm searching for purpose and I found it today and you can find it too friends you can find it right where you're sitting right now you can find and say Lord God maybe maybe you've never known him in that way maybe you've been born and raised in the truth but you sit here today and this preaching has led you to say to yourself I need more I need more of God I need more of something in my life Hallelujah you want to raise your hand up to God and admit that today and say master of all life come into my life and resurrect me to the newness of life that your word promises that's what will prove that you have passed from Death unto life when you're in complete nature your old Fallen nature that was so comfortable in the world is no longer comfortable there and you've been given a new nature you've been completely made as Paul would say a new creation as brother Brandon would say a brand new unit if I call up Chris and say Chris my AC's could put uh I need a I need a brand new unit Chris isn't doesn't take that that I mean come and rebuild it come and fix it I'm saying Chris I need a brand new unit be there tomorrow dad and when he shows up he's not break he's not got Parts he's got a brand new unit because I'm getting a brand new unit I don't just want to be repaired I'm not looking for a Band-Aid I don't need an adjustment I need it to be brand new Hallelujah I need a GPS believe that today oh let's stand up all over the building friends brand new you can be brand new you don't have to you might have come in here as one person you can leave as a completely different one you can have God moving in your life in a way that you never dreamed possible that's absolutely how God moves that's that's the the realities of the future hidden Mana did you know that the future hidden Mana it's that it's the eternal unfolding of Christ in the Eternal ages to come that's what the Book of Revelation means when it talks about the hidden manner and and the prophet said sometimes we get a little taste of the word of God or you know the movement of the Lord in our lives are we coming to a church service like this and we think it's so wonderful and brother Brandon and it is he's not saying it's not a the um a crumb of this is wonderful so he's not saying it's not wonderful he's just simply saying however someday you think this is good someday he in that word will become what you never dreamed possible but you never dreamed possible oh I don't know friends I can imagine quite a bit and the Lord is saying you've never imagined this it's never entered into the heart of man what God has in store for them that loving you might think that you're by your heads with me all over the building if you might think that you're a good person well and well and fine that's wonderful I'm glad that you have a uh that you don't suffer under an inferiority complex you think I'm a good person I do good things praise God God bless you keep doing them those are wonderful that's how you won't lose your reward uh the reap you reap what you sow if you if you sow Good Deeds God will cause Good Deeds to come your way if you sow the good word of God that'll grow a crop in your life don't you worry you bring a cup of cold water to one of God's family and Jesus said you'll never lose your reward for that in this life or the life to come so it's awful it's wonderful that you have good deeds and you feel like a good person but don't make the mistake that Eve made thinking she was okay and a good person when actually she stood in Peril of her life and it took Adam to open her eyes and then they knew they were naked maybe the second Adam is standing near you right now all heads bowed please all over the building I don't want anyone looking around [Music] maybe the second Adam is standing near you right now saying you are a good person that's fine but you're gonna need to be more than good you're going to need to be me that's the message of the Gospel you're going to need to be more than a church goer you're going to need more than to have your name on a church registry you're going to need to be more than a good man because there's none good no not one actually not in that not by comparison to God and the Lord might be saying to you today I'm glad you're good but good ain't gonna get it you're gonna need to be me and maybe right now you've maybe you've never invited him in your heart that way or maybe you have and yet you realize today that you still need more of God if you're in either one of those categories you want to raise the hand of the Lord I'll pray for you I want to embarrass you don't worry I'm not going to embarrass nobody I'll pray for you right now and I'll call anybody out we don't do that here but if you realize that you need more of God I'll pray for you God bless you brother brother sister lady sister God bless you God bless you sir brother there God sees those hands teenager
