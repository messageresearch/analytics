[44:35] shine

[47:25] couple quick announcements i want to

[47:30] the
[47:30] um new year's eve service we're planning
[47:33] so
[47:35] uh we're
[47:36] what we're going what i want to do is
[47:38] have
[47:39] a new year's eve service which will be
[47:42] december the 31st
[47:44] at our normal time starting up of 7 pm
[47:47] what we're going to do is we're going to
[47:50] move the service on december 29
[47:53] to december 31 so that's moving
[47:56] wednesday to
[47:57] friday you got that the last wednesday
[48:00] moved to the last friday december 29
[48:03] moved to december
[48:04] 31st uh it's not a watch night uh in the
[48:08] sense of going to the midnight hour
[48:11] but what we do want to we do like to do
[48:14] on that last service of the year
[48:16] is have communion and foot washing we
[48:19] didn't get to have foot washing last
[48:20] time because of the pandemic and what
[48:22] more but i feel good enough in my spirit
[48:25] we'll go ahead with commune and foot
[48:26] washing
[48:28] on that 31st friday
[48:31] now um what i'm going to actually do
[48:34] um is we'll have commune and foot
[48:36] washing
[48:37] and then i've asked our entire ministry
[48:39] team there's six of us now
[48:41] i've asked the entire ministry team to
[48:43] take 10 or 15 minutes
[48:45] of exhortation
[48:47] including myself i might take a few more
[48:49] than that but
[48:52] amen praise the lord
[48:55] but uh not not too many more than that
[48:57] amen i i want to have good participation
[49:01] and so uh what we'll do is that's going
[49:03] to be a little different this this year
[49:05] um i'm just kind of getting those weird
[49:07] ways where i sometimes flip things
[49:08] around
[49:09] but uh we're going to have the communion
[49:11] and the foot washing first
[49:13] rather than at the end and we just miss
[49:15] and go home i'd like to come in and have
[49:17] a few songs
[49:19] maybe a couple congregationals and maybe
[49:22] a special and then i want to go
[49:23] immediately into the lord's supper
[49:26] and
[49:27] foot washing and then when we come back
[49:29] in uh then we will go from there sing
[49:32] another song or two and then i'd like to
[49:35] have our team come up and just kind of
[49:37] uh give you something off of their heart
[49:40] um you know for me i just want to
[49:42] reflect a little bit on the year past
[49:44] and
[49:46] a little bit how the lord is dealing
[49:47] with my heart in the new year coming i
[49:49] hope that we don't end up spending one
[49:51] day in the new year
[49:55] see if we do i want to have a plan but i
[49:58] hope we don't i hope it's a plan i never
[50:00] have to put into play amen i would
[50:03] rather i would rather see
[50:05] uh this december i'd rather see tonight
[50:07] be the last service and in the morning
[50:10] we meet in glory hallelujah that would
[50:12] be grand wouldn't it and so um we're
[50:16] going to do that and uh it should follow
[50:19] for parents with children don't worry
[50:22] because it should follow pretty close to
[50:23] the normal dismissal time amen i don't i
[50:28] don't like having saints out on the road
[50:29] with their families late on new year's
[50:31] eve that's almost exactly why i don't do
[50:34] it um
[50:36] my involvement with law enforcement has
[50:38] shown me that south carolina has
[50:40] exceptionally lacks
[50:42] drunk driving laws and lawyers here
[50:45] make a killing amen they they flourish
[50:49] here because they can almost get you out
[50:51] of anything in the state of south
[50:52] carolina so we'll be letting out
[50:55] probably i'm going to aim at around 9 30
[50:57] and we should have everybody out pretty
[50:59] close to that amen praise the lord just
[51:01] want to make that announcement our last
[51:04] wednesday which will be the 29th is
[51:06] moved to friday the 31st and it's a new
[51:09] year's eve service and we're going to do
[51:11] a few special things there amen you got
[51:13] that
[51:14] praise the lord let's stand to our feet
[51:17] and we want to invite you to revelation
[51:19] chapter 10. i sure appreciate that
[51:22] singing and uh that special song i asked
[51:25] sister sarah to sing that for me i
[51:27] actually have a recording of her singing
[51:28] it i listen to it a lot and i love the
[51:32] words and i it just was going to go so
[51:34] perfect
[51:35] with my
[51:36] sermon this evening we're hoping by the
[51:38] will of the lord to conclude i don't
[51:40] make any promises but well even if i do
[51:42] it's just a human promise and it can get
[51:43] broken
[51:44] but
[51:45] i'm going to try by the will of the lord
[51:47] i believe i will be able to to finish
[51:50] the series here on the coming of the
[51:52] lord and we want to
[51:55] come this evening with us a particular
[51:58] subtitle that you're familiar with i

[54:17] but lord it means a great deal to me and
[54:19] i'm i i trust that i'll be able to bring
[54:22] it to the people lord with that kind of
[54:24] a feeling that i can also engage their
[54:27] heart on this lord here in the visible
[54:29] audience and those
[54:31] on the streaming network lord we commit
[54:34] it to you now in jesus name amen god
[54:37] bless you friends you can be seated
[54:51] we've been dealing
[54:53] exhaustively on this
[54:56] subject of the coming of the lord i
[54:58] think that we have certainly
[55:00] broadened your
[55:02] thinking to more than just on some day
[55:05] on a calendar the dead saints will be
[55:07] here and we'll change into new bodies i
[55:09] hope at this point we've been able thank
[55:11] you for the mat i hope that that we
[55:14] broadened your mind enough that you
[55:15] realize that there's a lot to do
[55:18] with the coming of the lord that isn't
[55:21] at all waiting for that glorious morning
[55:24] it's actually happening right now at
[55:26] least that's god's plan and so we've
[55:29] been trying to demonstrate to you and
[55:31] show you from the scripture
[55:33] that this this is a process this is a
[55:36] this is a whole collection of things
[55:39] that are taking place in real time as we
[55:42] live out real lives the coming of the
[55:44] lord uh it will be a surprise
[55:48] to
[55:49] the world but it shouldn't be a surprise
[55:52] to us
[55:53] since we're already in it i mean it
[55:55] wouldn't surprise you if i told you
[55:57] you're here would you
[55:59] would it
[56:00] why because you're already here if i
[56:02] said hey guess what you're in church
[56:05] you'd say yeah okay
[56:08] so it well it shouldn't take you by
[56:10] surprise if i say you know the rapture
[56:13] is coming because it's already happening
[56:15] and you're actually already involved in
[56:18] it and i'm here to tell you friends
[56:20] you're being caught up in it more than
[56:21] you realize god is doing more and i'm
[56:24] glad it's that way he's doing more than
[56:27] we realize and i want to say it like
[56:29] this and want to add this to it he's
[56:31] doing more than you're capable of
[56:34] and that's the best news that's the best
[56:37] news for me he's doing everything i
[56:40] can't do
[56:41] he's accomplishing everything that i
[56:43] fall short oh my we are coming to that
[56:47] perfect very image of god now
[56:51] one of the things that we've been
[56:52] showing you especially these last couple
[56:55] of parts and tonight and sunday are
[56:58] probably i would say the closest thing
[57:00] to my heart in all of this i've i showed
[57:02] you sunday how that you know that that
[57:06] this word that this rapture is able to
[57:09] live in our lives and manifest through
[57:11] our lives and that we are you know we we
[57:14] are we are uh dedicated to being a
[57:17] display
[57:18] for this descending of christ to the
[57:21] world you're the you're the last good
[57:24] that'll be here you're the last full
[57:27] image of truth that will be here
[57:30] this is the only opportunity right now
[57:33] is is the worst of times but it's the
[57:36] best of times
[57:38] it's the worst of times for the world
[57:40] and mankind but it's the best of times
[57:42] because there's never been a bride on
[57:44] the earth more visibly united and
[57:47] obvious that she has come into the image
[57:49] of god's word
[57:52] i mean even just the contrast
[57:55] just in contrast
[57:57] of what you of what uh contrast to the
[58:00] world just what you aren't
[58:03] is glorious
[58:05] i want to say sometimes you feel like
[58:07] you're behind the eight ball you you
[58:08] can't catch up you're not you're not
[58:10] doing very good i'm here to tell you
[58:12] what you are not is glorious in the eyes
[58:15] of god
[58:16] so just understand that
[58:19] that the lord is in this he's with you
[58:21] he's he's helping you he's moving
[58:24] through us he's bringing us to that
[58:26] don't let the devil discourage you with
[58:29] you
[58:30] [Music]
[58:33] because you're your biggest discourager
[58:35] you knock yourself out more than i more
[58:37] than anybody else can see because you
[58:40] you know who that man in the mirror is
[58:42] you know him better than anybody and you
[58:45] dread him more than anybody and but i'm
[58:47] here to tell you that he knows that man
[58:50] in the mirror better than you
[58:52] and he says you're a royal priesthood
[58:55] you're a chosen people you're a holy
[58:58] nation
[58:59] you're peculiar and i've i've called you
[59:02] and i've elected you now we've been
[59:04] showing you how that right off the very
[59:06] back in the first verse of chapter 10
[59:08] that christ is displaying himself in the
[59:12] imagery of of of himself in the bride
[59:16] it's just like in chapter one when he
[59:18] comes gird about the pabst with the
[59:19] golden girdle brother random says notice
[59:21] it's a woman but yet it's christ in the
[59:24] seven lamp stands but what the imagery
[59:26] of
[59:27] revelation is showing is that it's
[59:29] christ moving in his body that was
[59:31] always his goal
[59:34] to have a kingdom
[59:36] see
[59:37] to have a chosen generation
[59:40] a royal priesthood now look at what look
[59:43] at what
[59:44] being a in
[59:46] in the
[59:47] in the position of of of a priest
[59:50] look at what it enables you to do
[59:54] it enables you to bring forth praises of
[59:56] him who hath called you out of darkness
[59:59] to his marvelous light
[1:00:01] now
[1:00:02] the and this is why when he comes and he
[1:00:05] has a rainbow we've talked about all of
[1:00:06] the imagery here the fetus pillars of
[1:00:09] fire that's not pillar of fire because
[1:00:11] it's pillars of fire because it's
[1:00:13] according to the book of acts when he
[1:00:14] came in the upper room he divided
[1:00:16] himself into the church
[1:00:19] licks of fire fell on them all and so
[1:00:21] we've looked at the imagery i don't want
[1:00:22] to go over it all again tonight but one
[1:00:24] of the things that is look that we are
[1:00:26] looking at is this rainbow because this
[1:00:29] is this is all seven colors
[1:00:32] and that's significant that's highly
[1:00:34] significant that it comes in this age
[1:00:37] because it's the full seven colored
[1:00:41] rainbow display of his person
[1:00:45] see and it's now
[1:00:48] and because that it's the image of
[1:00:50] christ in his bride it's the full seven
[1:00:53] colored rainbow display of his person
[1:00:56] now completed through a bride who is in
[1:01:01] his very image by receiving his very
[1:01:03] word which is very him amen
[1:01:07] you understand
[1:01:08] and so this is this is so monumental
[1:01:11] this is what the ages have waited on
[1:01:13] when there would be a people in the
[1:01:15] earth who would who who a prophet could
[1:01:18] say she is him the prophet could say you
[1:01:22] are the blood of god by the spirit
[1:01:26] see
[1:01:28] and so this has
[1:01:30] this has restored
[1:01:32] true worship see
[1:01:34] this has restored this the fact that
[1:01:37] he's come in this end time the
[1:01:38] descending of the mighty angel in his
[1:01:41] full seven color rainbow on display
[1:01:44] means that that he now has a people who
[1:01:47] have been restored who can now give
[1:01:50] restored worship
[1:01:52] who have come into true fellowship who
[1:01:55] can now display true fellowship with
[1:01:58] christ true relationship restored like
[1:02:02] it was in the garden of eden
[1:02:06] this is the power even to the power of
[1:02:09] creation
[1:02:10] restored back to the end time bride
[1:02:14] the power of the spoken word as a
[1:02:16] prophet comes to it under the under the
[1:02:18] imagery of a wave sheath that was only
[1:02:21] proving that there's more in the field
[1:02:24] to come like that and as i pointed out
[1:02:26] to you many times there's many more
[1:02:28] there's four times more scriptures in
[1:02:30] revelation 10 that refer to your
[1:02:33] ministry as it refers to william
[1:02:35] branham's ministry
[1:02:37] that's not diminishing a prophet that's
[1:02:39] not elevating you above him that's not
[1:02:41] nothing of the kind we wouldn't have a
[1:02:44] message had that prophet not come but
[1:02:46] don't fall short and sit back and just
[1:02:49] think brother branham did it all and
[1:02:50] maybe he'll come back or maybe it's
[1:02:52] already done he's not when he comes back
[1:02:54] they're all coming back when he comes
[1:02:56] back my grandmother's coming back when
[1:02:58] he comes back my dad's coming back
[1:02:59] hallelujah
[1:03:01] we're not coming back for to carry the
[1:03:03] message around the world you are the
[1:03:05] message going around the world right now
[1:03:09] see
[1:03:10] and so we have been called
[1:03:13] to finally at last
[1:03:16] have this restored relationship have
[1:03:19] this restored fellowship have this
[1:03:22] restored true
[1:03:24] worship
[1:03:25] because not everyone that saith lord
[1:03:28] lord shall enter in
[1:03:29] and many shall worship him but jesus
[1:03:32] said in vain they do it
[1:03:34] see
[1:03:35] because they teach for doctrine the
[1:03:37] commandments of men but there had to be
[1:03:39] a people who could come to actual true
[1:03:42] restored worship
[1:03:45] so we are invited tonight to be a
[1:03:47] priesthood
[1:03:48] a royal priesthood see there's a lot i
[1:03:52] could i could take off on that just that
[1:03:54] item of it but i i don't want to get
[1:03:56] stuck there but but but this part of
[1:03:58] this priesthood is to take part in the
[1:04:02] in the full
[1:04:03] temple experience because if you look
[1:04:05] back in the old testament let me just
[1:04:06] touch it this much if you look back in
[1:04:08] the old testament you have you have
[1:04:11] outer court inner court and a and a most
[1:04:14] holy place you have an outer court you
[1:04:16] have the holy place you have the most
[1:04:17] holy place and we find that only the
[1:04:20] high priest could actually he was the
[1:04:22] only one authorized to to stand at every
[1:04:26] station now he had other priests
[1:04:28] standing at various places but he's the
[1:04:29] only one authorized to stand from the
[1:04:32] beginning to the end and go all the way
[1:04:34] into the shekinah and come back out and
[1:04:36] live to tell about it
[1:04:39] you understand
[1:04:40] because this is what is bringing true
[1:04:43] full temple experience you're not you're
[1:04:46] you're you're invited as a priest to
[1:04:49] have the full temple experience in your
[1:04:52] life
[1:04:53] we're not just talking about standing in
[1:04:55] the church queue we're not just talking
[1:04:57] about being part of a system being
[1:04:59] having your name on some book no no this
[1:05:01] is the full experience of the shekinah
[1:05:05] moving in people's lives again
[1:05:09] true worship friends you want to
[1:05:10] remember this
[1:05:12] true worship
[1:05:14] is not singing in music and emotional
[1:05:16] display
[1:05:20] that that's that's not even what i'm
[1:05:21] talking about
[1:05:22] anybody can do that
[1:05:25] but true worship is wearing the
[1:05:27] seven-colored rainbow
[1:05:30] true worship is being clothed in the
[1:05:33] garment of the son of man
[1:05:35] feeding on the body word of the son of
[1:05:37] man
[1:05:38] true worship because
[1:05:40] the true worship is wearing the seven
[1:05:43] colored rainbow because that is
[1:05:47] that rainbow is the representation of
[1:05:49] his full life
[1:05:51] that's why joseph got a coat of seven
[1:05:54] colors
[1:05:55] and all the bread not all the brothers
[1:05:57] got it only one chosen bro only one
[1:05:59] chosen son got it
[1:06:01] and it caused his brothers to be
[1:06:03] offended and that's why jesus would say
[1:06:06] blessed is he in whom is not offended in
[1:06:08] me
[1:06:09] see
[1:06:10] and so we you realize friends that that
[1:06:13] part of the
[1:06:14] the part of the reason of the coming of
[1:06:17] the lord was to bring this what i'm
[1:06:20] saying on your life
[1:06:23] so it's not just to wait on a day on the
[1:06:26] calendar when the dead and christ rise
[1:06:28] and we which are alive remain changed
[1:06:29] and are caught up that that that is
[1:06:32] coming as a consequence of this
[1:06:34] happening
[1:06:36] this happening right now you're sitting
[1:06:37] here believing the word and you're
[1:06:38] becoming the word and you're feeding on
[1:06:40] the word and that's because this is
[1:06:42] happening that's going to happen
[1:06:45] see
[1:06:47] so it's not merely doctrines it's not
[1:06:49] even correct doctrines our life
[1:06:52] amen is a worship
[1:06:56] our life is a worship
[1:06:58] that's what that's a part of why the
[1:07:02] coming of the lord happened in this day
[1:07:06] to restore this fellowship to restore
[1:07:09] this relationship to restore
[1:07:11] this
[1:07:12] worship
[1:07:14] worship takes place in
[1:07:16] in sacred places and and and there has
[1:07:19] to be a a a sacred space
[1:07:22] that and and what makes it a sacred
[1:07:25] space
[1:07:26] is that the presence of god is there yes
[1:07:29] praise god see
[1:07:32] and so
[1:07:33] you know
[1:07:34] when you when you i and just just
[1:07:36] looking at bible imagery and i
[1:07:39] have a look through a lot of not
[1:07:41] commentary but a lot of textual text
[1:07:44] manuals concerning
[1:07:46] dictionary of biblical imagery and
[1:07:47] various other ones but there's quite a
[1:07:49] bit said about this
[1:07:51] sacred space
[1:07:53] and one of the things that you that you
[1:07:55] want to get right quick is that the the
[1:07:58] sense of a sacred space
[1:08:00] it runs through strong through the whole
[1:08:02] bible
[1:08:03] there's constantly places where god
[1:08:05] comes and meets a man and that becomes a
[1:08:08] notable place
[1:08:10] god met
[1:08:12] abraham god met jacob god met moses god
[1:08:15] met this one god met that one see
[1:08:17] god met adam in in the garden of eden
[1:08:19] god met abel
[1:08:21] at his altar
[1:08:23] say did that did that become a sacred
[1:08:25] space it sure did say well but did it
[1:08:29] remain a sacred space
[1:08:30] it sure did because jesus died on the
[1:08:33] same rock
[1:08:36] the same rock abel died on the same rock
[1:08:39] moses stepped on which was christ christ
[1:08:42] died on that same rock
[1:08:43] prophet teaches us
[1:08:45] so we find then that that this sacred
[1:08:48] space is a place
[1:08:50] where god is encountered
[1:08:52] and by by virtue of his presence
[1:08:56] the very place itself becomes holy
[1:09:00] it becomes in the estimation of god
[1:09:03] something set apart from just an
[1:09:06] ordinary place now god created
[1:09:08] everything created the whole world you
[1:09:10] understand but we find that when his
[1:09:13] presence comes to a certain place and
[1:09:16] there's a certain action and that action
[1:09:18] is always the thing that the thing that
[1:09:20] completes the circuit is not just that
[1:09:23] god comes down but that he has his
[1:09:25] family come into a into a uniting and
[1:09:28] there becomes a connection and that
[1:09:31] makes it a holy place
[1:09:34] see
[1:09:38] when it's a physical location such as a
[1:09:41] mountain perhaps
[1:09:42] where abraham
[1:09:45] met him talked to him where abraham
[1:09:47] built an alter sacrificed his son and
[1:09:49] ended up sacrificing the ram
[1:09:52] a place where moses met him
[1:09:55] and you know when he when he approached
[1:09:58] the
[1:09:59] the burning bush and he said take off
[1:10:01] your shoes because now the ground that
[1:10:04] just a few hours before had been normal
[1:10:06] ground
[1:10:08] but now it's holy ground
[1:10:10] why because you've got god and now a
[1:10:13] prophet god didn't come down in the bush
[1:10:16] and and say on a big horn for the world
[1:10:19] to hear this ground is consecrated holy
[1:10:22] he didn't say it until a prophet
[1:10:24] approached and now you've got a
[1:10:25] connection and now it became a holy
[1:10:29] ground
[1:10:30] why because moses was playing a part in
[1:10:33] that connection oh can you see where
[1:10:34] your life is tonight can you see why god
[1:10:37] called you you're here to make a
[1:10:38] connection between heaven and earth and
[1:10:41] bring holiness to the earth
[1:10:45] this is the coming of the lord
[1:10:49] this is part of what it's accomplishing
[1:10:50] it's a very important part
[1:10:53] it's just as important as the dead in
[1:10:55] christ shall rise first and we which
[1:10:56] you're alive and remain shall be changed
[1:10:58] this is just as important as that
[1:11:00] without this that won't come
[1:11:03] you see
[1:11:05] so sometimes it can be a physical
[1:11:07] location sometimes it's just an altar of
[1:11:09] stones like the one jacob built when he
[1:11:11] built an altar
[1:11:13] and it becomes something more you know
[1:11:16] and and in fact is it becomes known and
[1:11:20] sometimes people
[1:11:21] return to it
[1:11:23] and then they'll return to it a again
[1:11:26] and again and again and and and and
[1:11:28] either physically sometimes or sometimes
[1:11:31] you know it's it's just maybe a memory
[1:11:35] maybe it's a time when you yourself were
[1:11:38] in deep prayer and your heart was heavy
[1:11:41] burdened and you needed god to come and
[1:11:43] talk to you
[1:11:45] you got in a situation and and you went
[1:11:47] to your knees and in desperation you
[1:11:49] said lord can you come i gotta talk it
[1:11:51] over
[1:11:52] and god came and you remember that time
[1:11:56] and that becomes a marker in your mind
[1:11:58] oh my
[1:12:00] oh i will tell you something friends
[1:12:02] when you have that kind of experience
[1:12:04] satan nor nobody else can ever take it
[1:12:06] from you because you know he was there
[1:12:09] and you know he'd talk to you and you
[1:12:11] know he answered you and what you prayed
[1:12:13] for happened
[1:12:16] see
[1:12:18] he told you what he would do and then he
[1:12:20] did it you know it was him
[1:12:25] in times of trouble you go back there in
[1:12:27] your mind again and again and again you
[1:12:29] relive
[1:12:30] those precious times
[1:12:32] because they they put strength in you i
[1:12:36] want to tell you something friends you
[1:12:37] need to have a a history in your mind of
[1:12:41] times when you know god met me i met him
[1:12:45] i talked to him i had a burden and he
[1:12:47] was faithful and he met my need and i
[1:12:50] know that was him
[1:12:53] because there might be times when you
[1:12:54] get in your life and you can't hear him
[1:12:56] and you can't feel him and you're
[1:12:57] praying and you've went back to the same
[1:13:00] place where you bowed the first time
[1:13:01] you've said the same words you've been
[1:13:03] just as sincere and he's quiet and he's
[1:13:06] silent and the devil's laughing and
[1:13:08] pushing and pressing i'm going to tell
[1:13:10] you that's when you've got to be certain
[1:13:12] of god that's when you've got to know i
[1:13:14] know that was him the last time and i
[1:13:17] know if he met me then he can meet me
[1:13:19] now
[1:13:21] this is the coming of the lord this is
[1:13:24] what it secures for the believer it
[1:13:26] gives you the opportunity to be a
[1:13:29] priesthood
[1:13:31] to give praises and worship that are
[1:13:34] acceptable in the mind of god
[1:13:39] some sacred places
[1:13:42] uh
[1:13:44] in the bible are the site of kind of a
[1:13:46] one-off
[1:13:47] encounter with god while others
[1:13:49] you know they
[1:13:51] they seem to have a continual visitation
[1:13:53] of the lord i mean the certainly the
[1:13:55] holy of holies and the the temple
[1:13:57] worship the tabernacle of the wilderness
[1:13:59] these would be places where god would
[1:14:00] come repeatedly and repeatedly
[1:14:02] and and and this is what the holy ghost
[1:14:06] has provided for you
[1:14:08] a place
[1:14:10] of continual visitation and presence
[1:14:14] see because he might he he records how
[1:14:18] that he came to this place or he came to
[1:14:19] this place you know he he he came in to
[1:14:22] gideon and he came you know to sampson's
[1:14:25] parents and he appeared to hear but
[1:14:27] there's no record he ever appeared back
[1:14:28] there again
[1:14:29] see he met he met jacob at bethel and
[1:14:33] jacob built an altar and the next thing
[1:14:35] you know he he makes a pledge to god he
[1:14:37] has a dream
[1:14:39] and he says my goodness this is the very
[1:14:41] gate of heaven he saw a ladder
[1:14:43] connecting heaven to earth and angels
[1:14:44] ascending and descending
[1:14:46] and the son of man standing at the top
[1:14:48] speaking to him and jacob carried that
[1:14:50] and it strengthened him and died it
[1:14:52] didn't make him a perfect person
[1:14:55] but god was making a pledge and jacob
[1:14:57] made a pledge if you go with me and if
[1:14:59] you'll i'll serve you and i'll pay my
[1:15:01] tithe to you and i will follow your word
[1:15:03] and you'll be my god and you'll go with
[1:15:05] me when i go and you'll be with me when
[1:15:07] i come and god said i'll do it jacob
[1:15:10] that's my promise to you and god never
[1:15:12] left him
[1:15:14] even when he was a shyster and and
[1:15:16] conniving his own family members i'm
[1:15:19] here to tell you god you say why would
[1:15:21] god do that because god knew there was
[1:15:22] going to come a time god knew he
[1:15:24] couldn't run in any longer that he would
[1:15:27] get to a point where he had to have an
[1:15:29] experience
[1:15:32] here to tell you something friends you
[1:15:34] would
[1:15:35] the way that we were in sin god should
[1:15:38] have long ago kicked us to the curb but
[1:15:40] god knows there's a time and there's a
[1:15:42] place and he's going to find you and
[1:15:44] he's going to fill you with his life and
[1:15:46] you're never going to be the same again
[1:15:48] and it'll be a continual presence a
[1:15:50] continual presence a continual presence
[1:15:53] in your life
[1:15:55] we're witnesses of it aren't we
[1:15:58] amen
[1:16:05] it's a connection
[1:16:08] to the unseen spiritual world
[1:16:11] and the bible pictures
[1:16:13] pictures it that that upper world it
[1:16:16] pictures it as the upper world reaching
[1:16:18] down into the ordinary routines of life
[1:16:21] that's that's the bible imagery
[1:16:24] of this communion
[1:16:26] that goes on of you becoming a priest
[1:16:28] to lift up praises to god this this
[1:16:31] place where you arrive to by the coming
[1:16:33] of the lord by the return of the token
[1:16:36] by the return of the abstract by the
[1:16:37] turn by the return of the full word we
[1:16:40] have now come back to that spot friends
[1:16:43] where the garden of eden is just in
[1:16:44] front of us amen
[1:16:47] just in front of us
[1:16:49] see the millennium that's what it's
[1:16:50] restoring
[1:16:53] and and and heaven and earth
[1:16:55] brother branham talks about even at
[1:16:57] calvary
[1:16:58] and how that heaven and earth embraced
[1:17:02] and kissed
[1:17:03] it was an embrace that that now they're
[1:17:05] joined back you understand when sin came
[1:17:08] that put a breach
[1:17:09] and god no longer had that kind of
[1:17:11] fellowship he could come down and anoint
[1:17:13] his people and talk to him and visit him
[1:17:15] but he couldn't live in him and that was
[1:17:16] his great desire
[1:17:18] his great desire was not to have a
[1:17:20] building with a priest in garments his
[1:17:23] great desire was to live in you
[1:17:26] his great desire was to have the
[1:17:28] fellowship that he had with his family
[1:17:30] before the fall took place
[1:17:34] and so the whole bible imagery is
[1:17:37] is this it's it's it's one of
[1:17:39] everlasting rest and peace
[1:17:41] back home
[1:17:43] back home
[1:17:45] redeemed after the fall i'm back home
[1:17:48] i've crossed the chasm i've i'm sitting
[1:17:51] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:17:53] i know this body is aging and getting
[1:17:55] sick and someday it'll give up the ghost
[1:17:57] if the lord don't come soon in my
[1:17:59] lifetime which i believe he will but i'm
[1:18:02] already home
[1:18:03] it ain't going to matter i'm already
[1:18:05] home moody said one day you're going to
[1:18:07] hear moody's dead don't you believe it
[1:18:10] hallelujah brother branham said to
[1:18:12] brother bosworth said brother brazworth
[1:18:14] you know you're dying he said i can't
[1:18:15] die billy
[1:18:16] i died a long time ago
[1:18:19] oh hallelujah friends this is the hope
[1:18:21] of the resurrection that we hold in our
[1:18:23] hearts
[1:18:25] oh my
[1:18:28] any place becomes a candidate to become
[1:18:31] sacred
[1:18:32] by virtue
[1:18:33] of a visitation from god we know that's
[1:18:37] true
[1:18:38] my goodness look at the places we took
[1:18:40] this temple
[1:18:42] but you know what now it's a holy
[1:18:44] priesthood
[1:18:46] you you can go you can you can go and
[1:18:49] buy an old abandoned building that used
[1:18:50] to be a brothel and go in there and gut
[1:18:54] it and clean it and start holding holy
[1:18:56] ghost services in it you'll drive out
[1:18:58] every demon that's been there for a
[1:19:00] hundred years
[1:19:01] you'll bring the power of god down and
[1:19:03] god will save sinners and he'll heal the
[1:19:05] sick in a place where the devil used to
[1:19:07] live now god's presence has made it a
[1:19:10] holy place it's made a connection place
[1:19:13] where heaven and earth connect
[1:19:16] and power supernatural power flows back
[1:19:19] and forth i tell you something friends
[1:19:20] if you could only see
[1:19:22] if you could only see in your mind's eye
[1:19:24] if god would open your eyes you'd see
[1:19:26] angels lining these walls you'd see a
[1:19:28] stream of light from here to heaven
[1:19:31] you'd see oh my that's what we have
[1:19:33] among us now
[1:19:38] for abraham and isaac
[1:19:42] mount moriah became a sacred site not
[1:19:44] because it held any special physical
[1:19:46] property not at all
[1:19:48] but because it's where abraham
[1:19:50] exercised his supreme faith
[1:19:53] see
[1:19:54] and and he's and he's rewarded by god
[1:19:56] you can read that in genesis 22 but you
[1:19:58] you we we spoke about jacob at bethel
[1:20:01] bethel was this ordinary ordinary ground
[1:20:03] there's nothing special about it at all
[1:20:05] see
[1:20:06] it was just ordinary landscape until god
[1:20:10] appeared there to jacob in a dream see
[1:20:14] and he says that surely
[1:20:16] the lord is in this place i didn't know
[1:20:18] it there this is none other than the
[1:20:19] house of god this is the gate of heaven
[1:20:21] i made this point in a previous section
[1:20:24] i'm just recovering a little bit tonight
[1:20:25] that's genesis 28. so i want to say to
[1:20:28] you friends our lives are this way
[1:20:31] our lives we we're just ordinary people
[1:20:34] it's not even the man that comes
[1:20:36] predestinated it's the seed of god
[1:20:38] placed in him we're just ordinary folk
[1:20:40] we're not we're not we're not super
[1:20:42] people we're just ordinary people
[1:20:44] hallelujah but we've been we've been
[1:20:46] instilled with an extraordinary purpose
[1:20:49] you've been given an extraordinary sea
[1:20:52] gene you've been given an extraordinary
[1:20:54] commission
[1:20:57] to be a royal priesthood lifting praises
[1:21:00] to god that are acceptable
[1:21:04] when the nation of israel set up 12
[1:21:06] stones of remembrance remember that
[1:21:08] following
[1:21:09] the crossing of the jordan joshua
[1:21:10] chapter 4. remember they
[1:21:12] when they cross it and they turn around
[1:21:13] and put the stones back as a memorial
[1:21:18] and and the jews you know identify that
[1:21:20] space
[1:21:21] and and that accompanying event is
[1:21:22] sacred in fact as many scholars
[1:21:24] believe that when when john
[1:21:27] in matthew 3
[1:21:28] is saying you know who warned you to
[1:21:30] flee
[1:21:31] from the wrath to come you generation of
[1:21:33] vipers said don't say within yourselves
[1:21:36] you know we have this we have that he
[1:21:37] said fry i say to you god's able these
[1:21:39] stones and most scholars believe he's
[1:21:40] pointing to that to the stones joshua
[1:21:42] laid in the river as a memorial that
[1:21:44] they still knew where they were
[1:21:46] so i'm going to tell you god can raise
[1:21:48] these stones in the jordan
[1:21:51] children to abraham
[1:21:53] see
[1:21:54] you're not going to be able to do this
[1:21:56] you're not going to be able to
[1:21:57] accomplish this this is going to have to
[1:21:59] take god to do
[1:22:01] this is what makes the coming of the
[1:22:03] lord in this hour so fantastic
[1:22:06] he's able to take a bride and lift her
[1:22:08] off the earth because he's here now
[1:22:10] changing her from the inside out
[1:22:14] see
[1:22:15] you can go down all the way down through
[1:22:16] the bible there's many places all oh my
[1:22:19] i'm just going to skip over many of them
[1:22:21] tonight i think i've maybe even
[1:22:23] mentioned the few of them before in
[1:22:24] other other portions but
[1:22:26] but but you remember that
[1:22:28] you know
[1:22:30] a a paradise i mean it was a paradise
[1:22:33] garden of eden
[1:22:35] that that was the first sacred spot
[1:22:38] that was the first sacred place was this
[1:22:42] paradise of eden that god created for
[1:22:45] the human race because
[1:22:47] god it's a place that god actually
[1:22:49] planted
[1:22:50] himself the bible says he planted a
[1:22:53] garden in the east of eden and this was
[1:22:56] for the his first human couple so it's a
[1:22:58] place which god
[1:23:00] was able to walk and have conversations
[1:23:04] with adam and eve on a daily basis
[1:23:06] brother branham says in the identified
[1:23:08] masterpiece of god
[1:23:11] he says let me have
[1:23:14] this handful of people here tonight now
[1:23:17] can you read yourself into this
[1:23:19] if god could have this handful of people
[1:23:21] here tonight
[1:23:23] fully
[1:23:25] fully
[1:23:26] considered to christ
[1:23:28] and their lives dedicated to christ
[1:23:32] i can do more with this handful or god
[1:23:35] can do more rather with this handful of
[1:23:37] people here than you could do with the
[1:23:40] whole world council of churches towards
[1:23:43] the kingdom of god one man surrendered
[1:23:46] into his hands fully
[1:23:49] amen that's all god needs
[1:23:53] one man he only needs one what if he
[1:23:55] could get this whole crowd what if
[1:23:57] bethel tabernacle has a as a universal
[1:23:59] group of believers we can all
[1:24:02] have our only consideration could be the
[1:24:04] word our only dedication would be to
[1:24:06] christ what god could do with this
[1:24:09] little church
[1:24:11] oh my friends he says i hear testimonies
[1:24:13] now watch he's going to talk about
[1:24:15] here's what here's what hinders it
[1:24:17] here's what hinders it he says i hear
[1:24:19] testimonies the old-fashioned
[1:24:20] pentecostals
[1:24:22] how they had prayer meetings all night
[1:24:23] long our fathers and mothers 40 50 years
[1:24:25] ago pray all night long

[1:24:30] but but you see
[1:24:33] we're not willing
[1:24:35] to lay still

[1:24:39] the thing where the old the indian how
[1:24:41] he purified gold was he beat on it and
[1:24:44] he beat all the draws out now they put
[1:24:45] it in a crucible and heat it and fire
[1:24:47] but it said he he would beat on it until
[1:24:49] he beat all the imperfections out and he
[1:24:51] could see his own reflection
[1:24:52] and then he knew he had pure gold
[1:24:55] and brother branham says he says you see
[1:24:57] we're not willing to lay still
[1:25:00] and let him beat this side and that side
[1:25:02] and knock this out and knock that out
[1:25:05] and knock this idea out and that and let
[1:25:09] jesus christ be reflected in us

[1:27:11] in 2021 what we need today is some real
[1:27:16] genuine prayer meetings some cleaning up

[1:27:20] janitor the whole house to be cleaned up
[1:27:24] i just say start right here lord start

[1:27:31] me slow me down and knock it all out of
[1:27:33] me knock the world out of me
[1:27:35] cause me to come into thy presence
[1:27:38] you realize friends that's what the
[1:27:40] coming of the lord is about so that you
[1:27:42] can come into his presence and have
[1:27:45] fellowship and have relationship and
[1:27:47] have life
[1:27:53] a sacred place
[1:27:58] that has the presence of god
[1:28:03] it creates
[1:28:04] a restored innocence
[1:28:07] amen
[1:28:08] and that's coming now to the real heart
[1:28:10] of my sermon tonight
[1:28:12] because that's what they had
[1:28:15] in the first
[1:28:16] sacred place
[1:28:18] they had innocence
[1:28:22] you you they they were adam
[1:28:24] adam was just
[1:28:26] unmovable untemptable
[1:28:29] unassailable
[1:28:31] he
[1:28:32] he was perfectly unconscious of the
[1:28:33] power he had he just speak to the wind
[1:28:36] without regard
[1:28:37] speak to a tree he didn't occur to him
[1:28:39] i've got to really have my faith going
[1:28:40] here
[1:28:42] this was you talking about somebody who
[1:28:44] knew who he was
[1:28:47] and the prophet comes back and says now
[1:28:49] here when the bride really knows who she
[1:28:51] really is
[1:28:53] say well
[1:28:54] what's going to do that what super
[1:28:55] fuel's going to give me that we i just
[1:28:57] read it for you i just read it for you
[1:28:59] slow down let him knock this out let him
[1:29:01] knock that out
[1:29:02] oh god kick some of those things out
[1:29:05] that are poisoning your lifestyle
[1:29:07] see those things that are poisoning and
[1:29:10] saturating your mind and putting you in
[1:29:12] too too big of a hurry and and and
[1:29:15] you've got to have time to go into the
[1:29:17] presence of god and spend some time
[1:29:20] there
[1:29:22] because it brings the power of creation
[1:29:24] that shouldn't surprise you
[1:29:27] because wherever the presence of god is
[1:29:29] the power of creation's there
[1:29:32] here's a being who just simply spoke and
[1:29:34] everything that is became
[1:29:36] see out of nothing he made everything
[1:29:41] he didn't have to have a starter kit
[1:29:45] he didn't have to build off of something
[1:29:47] he there was nothing until he spoke it
[1:29:50] and it became all things were made by
[1:29:54] him
[1:29:55] and there was not anything made that was
[1:29:57] made
[1:29:59] see
[1:30:02] when you're in this kind of a priesthood
[1:30:04] relationship with the lord
[1:30:06] when you have when you have come to the
[1:30:08] real purpose of the mighty angel
[1:30:11] descending
[1:30:13] his real purpose as i've said so many
[1:30:15] times wasn't to fill your head full of
[1:30:16] theology
[1:30:18] his whole purpose was what paul said to
[1:30:20] bring you into a fellowship to bring you
[1:30:23] into a priesthood to make you a royal
[1:30:25] priesthood a holy nation
[1:30:28] able to bring praises back to god you've
[1:30:31] you've reestablished that relational
[1:30:34] connection to god
[1:30:36] it brings if if that's the case if it's
[1:30:39] a restored presence then you can
[1:30:42] well imagine i shouldn't have to uh
[1:30:44] compel you to believe tonight that that
[1:30:47] restores you to innocence
[1:30:49] this is why brother branham could say
[1:30:51] we've come back as though we never did
[1:30:53] it in the first place
[1:30:55] it's not just forgiven it's as if you
[1:30:58] never actually did it
[1:31:00] because innocence is restored
[1:31:03] by the presence of god oh my
[1:31:06] hallelujah
[1:31:09] to be innocent
[1:31:11] is to be free from guilt
[1:31:14] to be innocent
[1:31:15] is to be blameless
[1:31:17] to be innocent
[1:31:19] is to be clean
[1:31:22] to be righteous
[1:31:25] oh friends the search for innocence
[1:31:28] this great quest of life that we find
[1:31:31] ourselves on you know it i know it as a
[1:31:34] believer i know i'm not unique in this i
[1:31:36] know you have it as well our whole quest
[1:31:40] of life is is for the this innocence to
[1:31:45] be brought back to me
[1:31:46] to where i can finally defeat me
[1:31:49] and be him
[1:31:51] to where i can finally have my mind
[1:31:53] clean all the time so i can finally have
[1:31:56] everything in my life pure
[1:31:58] and holy and righteous people don't want
[1:32:02] that then don't go to heaven because
[1:32:04] it's going to be filled with that
[1:32:08] oh my brother matt was brother matt
[1:32:11] smith we were in the fellowship hall
[1:32:12] sunday he was he was talking about his
[1:32:15] his his finishing portion of his lesson
[1:32:17] i've been so enjoying it i think
[1:32:18] scheduled for this sunday i think matt
[1:32:21] and
[1:32:22] and we find that
[1:32:24] it's true right okay i'm telling you now
[1:32:30] i think i told the rest of the team
[1:32:31] didn't tell you get used to it that's
[1:32:33] how we roll
[1:32:35] ask the brothers
[1:32:37] ask your dad he will tell you how many
[1:32:39] times he got a phone call at five
[1:32:41] o'clock
[1:32:42] amen but i knew i could always rely on
[1:32:44] brother dale i could have caught him at
[1:32:45] seven o'clock it wouldn't have mattered
[1:32:47] amen he's always got a he's always got a
[1:32:50] flips a switch and takes off
[1:32:52] preaching amen
[1:32:55] but how the that that the thing that is
[1:32:58] so grievous about hell is the absence of
[1:33:00] god
[1:33:01] amen
[1:33:04] and
[1:33:06] you have these people who just hate
[1:33:08] everything about god okay calm down
[1:33:11] relax god's got a place for you
[1:33:14] [Laughter]
[1:33:17] don't worry he won't be there
[1:33:19] you don't have to worry you don't have
[1:33:20] to be upset you don't have to dread hell
[1:33:22] god won't be there
[1:33:24] okay
[1:33:26] oh my
[1:33:28] but it is a quest for innocence isn't it
[1:33:30] friends
[1:33:32] because this was the original state of
[1:33:34] the human race the the whole bible
[1:33:37] records this quest of the soul
[1:33:39] of the of the family of god to regain
[1:33:43] that state of perfect righteousness that
[1:33:46] is that is with me every day that oh
[1:33:48] what heaven's gonna be i'm i'm glad for
[1:33:51] streets of gold walls of jasper i'm glad
[1:33:53] for all of that but i'm gonna be so glad
[1:33:55] to reclaim
[1:33:58] to reclaim that perfect righteousness to
[1:34:01] reclaim that perfect fellowship with god
[1:34:05] where i don't have to battle this fallen
[1:34:08] body and this fallen world and this
[1:34:10] demon powers that are streaming through
[1:34:12] the earth i i'm i'm thankful for the
[1:34:15] coming of the lord
[1:34:19] amen to be guiltless
[1:34:21] can you think of it
[1:34:23] can you imagine it
[1:34:25] to be guiltless
[1:34:26] to be blameless
[1:34:28] to be pure
[1:34:29] to be holy to be innocent
[1:34:33] it remains to this day the deepest cry
[1:34:35] of my soul i'm positive it's the deepest
[1:34:38] cry of your soul listen don't let wealth
[1:34:40] and fame fortune in glory don't let that
[1:34:43] young people don't let that be your your
[1:34:45] greatest quest
[1:34:46] have a quest for righteousness
[1:34:49] get get your soul back to innocence in
[1:34:52] the presence of god
[1:34:57] that's the deepest cry brother branham
[1:35:00] said it in the in the identified
[1:35:02] masterpiece he carries on it takes the
[1:35:04] power of christ to change a man
[1:35:07] and i'm glad he said it this way it
[1:35:08] takes the power of christ to keep a man
[1:35:12] see now watch
[1:35:15] what we need today is the life of christ
[1:35:17] inside of us
[1:35:20] that's what purifies
[1:35:22] see
[1:35:23] not the outward a turned around collar a
[1:35:26] degree of psychology or something no no
[1:35:29] it takes the power of the resurrected
[1:35:32] christ to make us
[1:35:34] what we should be
[1:35:37] god has no other plan
[1:35:40] then let the holy spirit rule and reign
[1:35:44] in the church
[1:35:46] they build all kinds of churches
[1:35:49] but that's that's not in god's plan
[1:35:52] because god's plan never includes being
[1:35:54] run in a church
[1:35:57] god's plan includes god running the
[1:36:00] church
[1:36:01] see
[1:36:02] the tabernacle
[1:36:05] in the wilderness and the
[1:36:07] temple that solomon built what supreme
[1:36:13] examples in the old testament you
[1:36:14] couldn't find
[1:36:15] better example of what god was aiming at
[1:36:18] to accomplish
[1:36:19] in the era of the holy ghost
[1:36:22] because it was the place that god would
[1:36:24] choose for his name to dwell
[1:36:27] see
[1:36:28] and and and which for israel
[1:36:30] remember that israel's that was their
[1:36:33] mission was that they were to
[1:36:36] displace
[1:36:37] the
[1:36:38] they they took the land of canaan
[1:36:41] and it was filled with canaanites
[1:36:44] and canaanites were everywhere
[1:36:47] and the whole world was sown over in
[1:36:50] heathenism
[1:36:51] and god called one man abraham and said
[1:36:54] i'm going to make a nation out of you
[1:36:56] and and you're going to sojourn in a
[1:36:58] strange land but then i'll bring you up
[1:37:00] by mighty hand because i got to grow you
[1:37:01] there you're going to become two and a
[1:37:02] half million i'm going to bring you out
[1:37:04] by mighty hand i'm going to take you
[1:37:06] through a journey and i'm going to i'm
[1:37:08] going to you're going to go into the
[1:37:09] heart of this heathen land and you're
[1:37:12] going to establish yourself drive out
[1:37:15] all the occupants and set up true
[1:37:17] worship as an example you're going to
[1:37:20] displace
[1:37:22] all of the false narratives you're going
[1:37:25] to displace all of the false worship and
[1:37:28] all the misunderstandings that all the
[1:37:30] heathens had they were going to be the
[1:37:32] crowning jewel
[1:37:34] as a people
[1:37:36] and and and from there god was going to
[1:37:39] send his light that was the plan to go
[1:37:42] into all the world
[1:37:44] see
[1:37:45] now don't don't fear because i know that
[1:37:48] you know they were they were to displace
[1:37:50] all that all that canaanite worship they
[1:37:52] didn't do a very good job of it but it's
[1:37:54] going to get done
[1:37:56] in the millennium it's going to get done
[1:37:59] see
[1:38:00] and so so we
[1:38:03] we see then when we look at revelation
[1:38:05] 10.
[1:38:08] and then when you look at at the
[1:38:10] measurable measurably perfected bride
[1:38:13] as it's indicated in revelation 11 1
[1:38:16] she's she's she's the inner court
[1:38:18] measured and perfect
[1:38:20] the outer court's not measured the
[1:38:22] gentiles the rest of them are going into
[1:38:23] the tribulation the gospel is going to
[1:38:25] the jews
[1:38:27] but revelation 11 1 validates everything
[1:38:31] from 10 1 all the way through 10 1 to
[1:38:34] 11.
[1:38:35] it validates that everything that we've
[1:38:38] believed is true
[1:38:42] things that god had declared for
[1:38:44] thousands of years
[1:38:47] he vindicated in the day you live in
[1:38:50] [Music]
[1:38:51] things that god had declared down
[1:38:54] through history uh that that there would
[1:38:57] be there would come a time that there
[1:38:59] would be no place of true worship
[1:39:03] anywhere in the world except where his
[1:39:06] name was
[1:39:09] see
[1:39:10] only where his name was and as brother
[1:39:12] branham would so often say say he would
[1:39:15] so often say that he put his name in
[1:39:17] christ and christ is the word
[1:39:20] so then there's no fellowship outside of
[1:39:23] the blood because it had to be it had to
[1:39:25] be connected to his presence
[1:39:28] you understand that that was the whole
[1:39:30] point they couldn't just go out
[1:39:32] somewhere and slay an animal they had to
[1:39:34] bring their sacrifice to the door
[1:39:36] because it had to be recognized by the
[1:39:38] presence of god
[1:39:40] oh friend you can't you don't get to
[1:39:43] just decide how to worship god he has
[1:39:45] one provided way
[1:39:49] amen there is no fellowship outside of
[1:39:52] his provided way
[1:39:54] it cannot be a man-made idea or a
[1:39:56] man-made ideology or a man-made idol
[1:39:59] jesus says to the woman at the whale
[1:40:01] woman the time he says
[1:40:03] he tells her that the time was
[1:40:05] approaching when she when when she would
[1:40:07] worship the father neither in her
[1:40:10] mountain or even at jerusalem but he
[1:40:12] said the hour cometh and now is when the
[1:40:15] true worshipers shall worship the father
[1:40:17] in spirit and in truth for the father
[1:40:20] seeketh such to worship he's always been
[1:40:23] after that
[1:40:24] everything he's ever done is to
[1:40:26] accomplish that you're it
[1:40:29] it's accomplished in this bride
[1:40:32] hallelujah
[1:40:36] scripture
[1:40:37] isaiah picks up in his second chapter
[1:40:39] and how there's a vision of of a world
[1:40:42] when he when he looks at the millennium
[1:40:45] i know israel failed but don't forget
[1:40:48] friends we've got a millennium coming
[1:40:51] we're right on the edge of it now
[1:40:53] and how that the scriptures in isaiah 2
[1:40:56] envision a world of total peace
[1:40:59] in which people
[1:41:00] people literally beat all of their
[1:41:02] farming tools into beat all of their
[1:41:05] weapons of war into farming tools
[1:41:08] all of them they're swords
[1:41:10] they're spears they all get they all
[1:41:14] do away with it we won't need swords and
[1:41:16] spears we won't need weapons of war
[1:41:20] in the millennium because it's going to
[1:41:22] be a world of total peace
[1:41:27] he goes on in the 32nd chapter how that
[1:41:30] there's this there'll be this vast
[1:41:32] sacred place where the spirit of god
[1:41:36] will be poured out from on high and
[1:41:39] justice will dwell in the wilderness and
[1:41:41] righteous will abide in the fruitful
[1:41:43] field it's going to be global
[1:41:48] finally habakkuk says in chapter 2 that
[1:41:50] the whole earth
[1:41:54] think of what it is friends just ahead
[1:41:55] of us
[1:41:56] think of what the coming of the lord
[1:41:58] think of what the mighty angel
[1:41:59] descending has come to accomplish
[1:42:02] the whole earth will be filled with the
[1:42:05] knowledge of the glory of the lord
[1:42:09] as the waters cover the sea
[1:42:13] in fact zechariah records in zechariah
[1:42:15] 14 that the coming of this golden age
[1:42:18] will be so great it'll be so wonderful
[1:42:22] that even that even the bells of the
[1:42:24] horses will be inscribed holiness unto
[1:42:27] the lord and every pot in jerusalem and
[1:42:30] judea shall be sacred to the lord
[1:42:34] oh my
[1:42:35] when i think about what's coming
[1:42:38] he says here in revelation 21 27 and
[1:42:41] there shall in no wise enter in
[1:42:44] into it anything
[1:42:47] that defileth
[1:42:49] neither whatsoever worketh abomination
[1:42:51] or maketh a lie
[1:42:53] but they which are written
[1:42:55] in the lamb's book of life
[1:43:01] this
[1:43:03] this is the power of a sacred place
[1:43:07] i want you to grasp that for a moment
[1:43:09] this is the kind of power re put it up
[1:43:11] again caleb this is what a sacred place
[1:43:14] accomplishes there shall in no wise
[1:43:17] enter in anything that defileth neither
[1:43:19] whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh
[1:43:21] the lie but they which are written in
[1:43:23] the lamb's book of life
[1:43:25] revelation 21 27 records that this
[1:43:28] sacred place has decisively expelled
[1:43:33] all
[1:43:34] evil
[1:43:36] amen get your mind around that for a
[1:43:38] minute it
[1:43:40] that and that's that's what a sacred
[1:43:43] space in you can accomplish
[1:43:47] do you realize today that when he calls
[1:43:48] you to a and calls you a royal
[1:43:51] priesthood
[1:43:52] he calls you a holy nation that you're a
[1:43:55] peculiar people that your chosen people
[1:43:58] he's he's called you to make you a
[1:44:00] sacred place
[1:44:02] you're a sacred space for the presence
[1:44:05] of god to move in and out of and when
[1:44:08] when you are surrendered to that then
[1:44:11] that expels all evil how many want to
[1:44:13] have all evil expelled out of their life
[1:44:16] i say oh god all evil all weaknesses all
[1:44:19] failures forever forever forever gone
[1:44:22] from me
[1:44:25] there is value friends in being a sacred
[1:44:27] space that god can dwell in
[1:44:30] there's value in it tonight
[1:44:33] i hope i'm this preaching this little
[1:44:35] sermon i'm going to close here in a
[1:44:36] minute
[1:44:37] but i hope that this series has shown
[1:44:39] you that the coming of the lord is far
[1:44:42] more than just the dead in christ rise
[1:44:44] and we get changed
[1:44:45] oh friends this is something that's been
[1:44:48] going on it's moving around the world
[1:44:49] it's calling a bride it's separating
[1:44:51] around yes we got failures but we won't
[1:44:53] have yes we got weaknesses but we won't
[1:44:56] have oh yes i still gotta i still gotta
[1:44:59] battle me you won't after a while
[1:45:01] oh hallelujah i want to be a sacred
[1:45:04] space
[1:45:05] i want to be a place where the word of
[1:45:07] god can move in and out of my life oh
[1:45:10] hallelujah you become permanently exempt
[1:45:13] from decay

[1:45:19] is dwelling present
[1:45:21] in the holy of holies in your heart
[1:45:24] your soul friends becomes exempt from
[1:45:27] decay
[1:45:28] or the possibility of ever being lost
[1:45:31] again
[1:45:34] now you hit the devil between the eyes
[1:45:36] with that one
[1:45:38] you let him know i am a royal priesthood
[1:45:40] i god comes down and lives in the in the
[1:45:43] most holy place of my soul and i am
[1:45:46] exempt from decay i have no possibility
[1:45:49] of ever being lost again
[1:45:51] what a glorious testimony i have no
[1:45:55] possibility brother branham tells him
[1:45:57] that message
[1:45:58] and i'll close with this
[1:46:01] it's such a beautiful story you've heard
[1:46:03] it so many times
[1:46:05] about the violin that they were
[1:46:06] auctioning
[1:46:08] they couldn't get anything for it nobody
[1:46:09] even want to bid on it
[1:46:11] it was it was you know it was
[1:46:13] dilapidated and and
[1:46:15] grungy and broken and it you know just
[1:46:18] it just looked like a piece of junk
[1:46:21] but there was a master
[1:46:24] violinist
[1:46:25] in the audience who looked at it and
[1:46:27] knew that it was a masterpiece
[1:46:29] no one knew but his eye was trained to
[1:46:31] catch it
[1:46:32] and he gets up and comes forward and
[1:46:34] says may i examine it and when he
[1:46:36] examines it his all everything that he
[1:46:38] thought was true and he takes his little
[1:46:41] bag and he opens up all of the little
[1:46:43] stuff and he starts cleaning it and
[1:46:45] tuning it and rosining the bow and
[1:46:46] getting everything ready and then he
[1:46:48] picks it up into his hands and the
[1:46:51] master begins to express his inner music
[1:46:55] through this instrument
[1:46:57] and that and that that music from the
[1:47:00] master went through the instrument and
[1:47:02] into the people and people became
[1:47:05] enraptured and they bid ten thousand a
[1:47:07] hundred thousand a million dollars and
[1:47:09] that the thing just it became a
[1:47:11] priceless violin
[1:47:13] that's a story out of history what what
[1:47:15] happened friends the master picked it up
[1:47:19] oh my my my it's not you see
[1:47:22] you understand that's what god did to
[1:47:24] you
[1:47:25] you understand that that's the reason he
[1:47:27] did it he picked you up you were broken
[1:47:29] and rubbish and you were ready for
[1:47:31] nothing and he picks you up cleans you
[1:47:33] up tunes your life and rosins everything
[1:47:36] up and gets it ready why so that he can
[1:47:39] express his music through you to the
[1:47:42] world
[1:47:43] so that the world can see value in him
[1:47:46] not valuing you valuing
[1:47:48] him that's why we're priesthood to lift
[1:47:52] up praises to god
[1:47:56] see you say oh my
[1:47:58] if you just knew my life brother jason
[1:48:00] preacher man my life if you only knew my
[1:48:03] past but friends you have to understand
[1:48:05] that redemption
[1:48:06] redemption comes not to deal with what
[1:48:09] we did
[1:48:10] but redemption comes to deal with what
[1:48:12] we had become
[1:48:15] it had nothing to do with what i did in
[1:48:17] my past it's it's i was born in sin
[1:48:20] i was a son of god but i got trapped in
[1:48:23] a wrong kind of a birth had nothing to
[1:48:25] do with what i did it's what i had
[1:48:27] become and he come to redeem me
[1:48:30] back hallelujah and through his
[1:48:33] sacrifice at calvary and the baptism of
[1:48:35] the holy spirit he has redeemed my life
[1:48:38] back to him and dismissed everything
[1:48:41] that i ever did wrong dismissed it
[1:48:43] completely out of existence out of his
[1:48:45] memory can never be brought against me
[1:48:47] as a charge
