========================================
[Music] God bless you all this morning amen good to be in the house of the Lord let's just all stand and we're gonna uh turn in our Bibles this morning we're going to turn to the Book of Proverbs first we're going to go to two two verses just two single verses today the first one is proverbs 4 and verse 7 amen it says wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding and then we're going to turn over in the New Testament to James the Book of James chapter 4 it's right uh right after Hebrews James 4 right before Peter James 4:10 it says humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord Lord and He Shall lift you up amen let's go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for this day father we thank you for Lord just the reading of your word we pray that you'd Lord open it up to us today Lord we love you and we humble our hearts to you now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you as you take your seats this morning I've got a bit of an odd title this morning the Lord laid on my heart um a few days ago after my to so TI angles like angles in Geometry Not Angels amen um I have several quotes and several pictures this morning I so I made a slideshow for us to follow along and we'll get to that in just a few minutes you can leave that up though that's fine um we're going to look at Angles and perspectives this morning um perspectives are in the most basic sense a point of view um and I want to type it this morning to our our opening scriptures in with humility and with wisdom and that's why I chose those two uh two verses to open with I believe that perspective can lead to wisdom in a lot of situations amen often times if we can go into a situation or a question that we have in our hearts with humility God is able to show you the right angle and give you understanding on that issue amen and um you know we we receive perspective from many different sources I believe it's important to reach out to others that you trust for perspective um you know because many times they they might see things at at a different angle or at a different a different Viewpoint to give you a clearer picture of of what's going on to give you a more clear understanding um and that's in counsel in our friends and and people that we trust that hopefully have an experience with God Amen um but even more importantly when you find yourself in a situation that you can't seem to grasp and you don't know what to do God always knows best because he sees and he sees every angle amen um so so many times I believe that God is willing to give us insight to his view but it does require the correct approach and we've got to be willing to take it however it comes amen we when we were speaking last Sunday we spoke on on Josiah and his approach to God and how he humbled himself and just at the humility of his approach God held back cursing the entire Kingdom throughout his whole reign as a king amen so let's go to the next slide brother um I'll just have you control it I don't know how this thing even works it looks like it's on so we'll try so I'm going to have you follow me through this quote this comes from expectation 1958 where where my inspiration had come for this morning he says once there was a young musician who had trained in all the music that he knowed how to be trained in for he wanted to master in it and there was a great concert and there was a young fellow was to play and this young fellow was to play after he got through with his master playing oh he was Grand and all the people began to stand to their feet and applaud the young man with clapping their hands and screaming and whistling but they noticed the young man did not even notice any of that let me see if I can it works awesome he kept his eyes looking up and the more they tried to attract his attention by their screams and applauding he looked steadfast towards the top of the balcony and the audience was amazed to see him not accepting or bowing their applauding and they turned to see and up in the balcony was the old Master teach teacher he was looking up to see what the old Master said and not paying attention to what the people was around him saying if we could only do the same if we could look up and see what the master is saying and not notice what the people are saying amen John spra who was healed with a throat that could not speak which alarmed the nation through the magazines I was talking to him some time ago and he said I was in Paris and I was taking the tour around seeing the religious sights and so forth and I came into this certain garden and he said there was a statue of Christ and said I was looking at it and said my wife was looking at it and we were criticizing it in our hearts because it didn't have any really look to it that would look like the sufferings of Christ amen let me just follow along on here didn't have any look of it that would be like like the sufferings of Christ and said the guide came to me and he said sir you're probably doing just like all the rest of the tourists do when they come here you're wondering why the sculpture ever made the Statue like that he said yes sir I was he said come here just a moment he said you see there is a kneeling rail beneath the statue said yes sir said that's an altar said now you come here and get down on your knees and said now Now look up and when he looked up he said his heart almost failed him for the sufferings of Christ was seen in the sculptor's work and he said sir do you see this what the do you see the sculptor had in mind that Christ is to be knelt and looked up to that's the way he made it not to stand off criticize but if you'll get down and you'll look up to it then you'll see the full purpose my goodness and before you criticize the Holy Spirit and God's word it wasn't made to be criticized neither was the Holy Spirit kneel on your knees and look up to it and you'll think differently and God bless you s shall we pray and so he says we can just take that down for just a few minutes I'll have you go to the next slide here and just just a few minutes they were looking at this sculpture and they began to almost be critical of it you know they were Christians and yet they saw how it almost seemed that they were doing some kind of an injustice to to the cross of their lord and but the moment that they changed their Viewpoint the moment they got on their knees and looked up they saw the sculpture from a whole new angle amen and that's that's the only way the artist meant people to view the work of art it must have been I believe that the designer knew that only those who had experienced the love of the man on that cross would be able to respect and appreciate it the way that it was meant to be appreciated in the angle in which it was meant to be appreciated amen so he crafted it in a way the designer the sculptor crafted it in a way that only those who were willing to go at the foot of that cross and get on their knees and look up were able to see the whole picture amen glory to God and you know he um that just that just types everything in our in our Christian experience having the right having the right approach having the right attitude you know and um he told the disciples I wanted to catch this verse if you want to go to it for me brother Matthew 10 and verse 10 he told the disciples these things aren't given to them to understand but to you it is given amen Matthew 10 and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in Parables and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom but to them it is not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath therefore I speak to them in Parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and then in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isias which saith by hearing ye shall hear and not understand and seeing ye shall see and not perceive for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them and then in verse 16 he comes and says but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you have heard and have not heard them and I believe that the same thing applies today many people can can read the same word that we read and can read the same things that we read and hear the same things that we hear but they don't have the right angle on it amen they don't have the Revelation because it wasn't given to them to see amen it wasn't given to them to hear um and and you see the the value the exponential value at at looking at something from the correct angle you know even when it requires sometimes a conscious effort to go out of your way to do it the sculptor when he created that sculpture sculpture of Christ he wanted to make sure that when people looked at this sculpture that they would see the fullness of what Christ had done for them and saw what what how God had suffered and died but anybody that would just pass by anybody that just reads the word just sees it and they don't see the fullness of what God really did for them amen until you have that experience where you get on your knees amen and you look up to Christ and you see him at a different Viewpoint you see him at a different angle at that point you're able to catch the revelation of what Jesus really did for us what he did for you personally not what he did for them but what he did for you and that's I I just thought that scripture or that uh that story brother renham tells of that man just typed so closely to what it is so it's so important for us to make sure that we have the right Viewpoint you know on our Christian walk but in every situation that we face this could go from from the biggest decisions you make to the smallest decisions you make because God is in all of it amen he's in every step that you're taking he's in every move you're making amen so sometimes it just requires us to take a a look from a different angle take a look from a different perspective amen um you know brother brandham had this dilemma he was facing one one day discussing discussing Jesus as the judge and he was talking about the supernatural Cloud there in Arizona that was captured 1963 and you know he tells this full story there in spiritual food and due season we're just going to catch part of it this morning um but I I have it if you if you want me to send it to you he couldn't he couldn't make out Jesus standing there with white hair as wool he he just couldn't quite understand it so he began calling his friends that were theologians and and doctors of divinity in the scripture and they gave him some explanation of the thing you know but the explanation that they gave him it just didn't resonate with brother brandom and so he brought it before God I don't think I have this in the in the slid so just going to go through this brother random says I got in the room there and I got to speaking to God and I run my accordance to take it back to D take it back to Daniel where it said and he came in the Ancient of Days whose hair was white as wool and I said Lord I don't know what to say and got the responsibility now that was before and remember before the Seven Seals was open about a year or more before I was praying there Lord what was it and I looked standing before me and there stood a man and he was a judge and he had a white wig on the old judges of ancient days used to wear a white wig to show that he was supreme authority and then when I seen Jesus with the white wig I said it only vindicates the truth that we know that he is the supreme authority God witnessed the same thing on Mount Transfiguration and said this is my beloved Son hear him the supreme authority moving down a little bit further he's begins talking about this cloud and he says now that then when that went up the big observatories from way down in California Plum down in Mexico over Tucson everywhere taking the picture of it it was a mysterious sight brother sofman here standing right yeah stay there for me standing right back there and I and brother Jee Norman standing right there present when it went up they took the picture still they don't know what about it here's some time ago everybody saying looky here looks like this and them Angels wings and how they folded in there and this is this is this next part is what I wanted to get to this morning if you catch the cloud and we all we're all familiar with this and we we all know where I'm going with this but one day he says one day turning it to the right looking there was Jesus Christ as perfect as Hoffman ever draw him it was standing there with the white wig on looking back towards the Earth showing that he is supreme authority the heavens declared it the Bible declares it the message declares it all the same supreme authority with the white wig on you see his black beard under many of you have seen the picture we got it right back there just turn it to the right sideways and look at it there he is just as perfect as it was if it had been photographed of him they were looking at it from the wrong angle you've got to look in the right angle amen and we see that today you I mean it there's many people you know who could still who still look at this picture and they still they could see it in this angle but they don't have the revelation of it so they try to explain it away but once you have eyes to see you can't unsee it amen you can't you can't look at that and say anything other than that's Christ amen and the only way he says that God can reveal Only God Can reveal which is the right angle you turn it to the right and look at it there he is just as perfect as if it had been photographed up there and then he said my my house has never been without that picture so you've got to look you've got to have what he says you've got to have the Lord to have you show to show you to look at it from the right angle amen and that that angle we were talking about it's it's perspective and and it can be tied to Revelation if you looked at that cloud with the wrong perspective or the wrong angle you might not and you people still might not be able to see amen what it is and what it means but if you're willing to do what that couple did in the story and get down on your knees and look up amen anybody that has that wants to follow Christ in the fullness of the word it doesn't matter where you are in life if you're willing to see something amen and I'm talking about the message of the hour if you're willing to Humble yourselves enough to see that God can still speak in this final day to you and look up and see God can show you the revelation God can show you the right angle you to look at that thing amen and and um and I believe it's it's it was like I said the sculptor had a purpose in making it that way um go to the next slide brother I think brother benam says that just puts me in mind of a Greek artist I seen one time in an ancient Cathedral showing what Adam and Eve looked like they looked like beasts or something and that's what the caral mind can perceive of some spiritual thing I think Adam was the most handsome man that ever lived and Eve was perfect a perfect woman in every way and now carnal Minds wrap up the thing in their own ideas and then God sends down and unfolds The Thing by his power amen your carnal mind our human mind can perceive something a certain way we get some idea of how something should be we get some idea of how we need to act we get some idea and we can even we can even think that it's right be sincere in thinking that it's right and it seems like it is right but until God shows you that it's the right thing until he opens up his word to you amen and and he gives you his revealing power you've got to take all the carnal mind and the your own perception out of the thing amen because carnal minds and perceptions that you have will never match up to what God can see amen um I think that there's there's uh a great value in having we talked about this a minute ago having another uh another person's perspective on a subject you know because we see we see things differently you know we're crafted differently amen you can see that in the gospels you see the same story told several times and it will have the same characteristics and the same idea and the same validity to it but because God chose different men to write it some things stand out to this man that didn't maybe stand out to this man amen because there was a different there was a different angle that they were looking at it from amen and that's what we are as Brothers and Sisters in Christ you know it says bear one another's burdens with each other so we we we we counsel with each other and you say well this is what I'm going through and you know if you approach it from the right angle and you allow your brother to to be a help in your life and you show him what you're going through maybe he can provide another perspective another angle another Viewpoint to give you Insight on how to handle that kind of situation amen um I think this this is also a really important concept when it comes to prayer um if you go to the next slide I think brother Brenham says this in questions and answers he says how do you feel is best the best way to find the Lord how do you feel it's the best way to find the Lord's will in some important matters now I don't believe let me see if I can get the can get continuity on it how do you feel is the best way um I see it should be a comment here I said was how do you feel is the best way to find the Lord's will in some important matters I tell you dear friend the best way to find the will of God in some important matters in life if you go to the next slide now let me here's a wonderful little thing if you have a matter that's very important now young people it doesn't matter what age you are if you have a matter that's very important listen to what the prophet says now there's the way I do it I take it before the Lord it's always been my strength I wait upon the Lord and see what he says and I just let myself neutral to it I don't take either side and say now Heavenly Father it can and it can and he's really just showing our human nature because when we have something that we're praying about whoever we are you know that maybe you want to go a certain way with it amen that's just our human nature you know Lord I'm laying this out before you but you know in your mind or in your heart maybe you want to go a certain way about it but brother brandom had this strength and he T types this out and he says if you get completely neutral on the subject it does it doesn't matter what it is small or big if you get completely neutral and you're willing to let the Lord actually speak to you because what happens often times is as we can take a subject to the Lord and we have a way that we already want to go with it amen and so then you're we're going to try to justify every which way to go that specific Direction I mean we're going to push and pry and try and do everything we can to go that way but God wants us to be neutral on it because maybe maybe we've offered two ways and he wants you to go a Third Way amen maybe he maybe he shows you three ways and there's the fourth way you know God has God sees everything amen he knows our life he knows every Every Which Way that we're going to go every decision we're going to make all of those things so sometimes we have these decisions that we need to make or we have these paths we're trying to take or we have you know we're praying about something this is how we have to do it he says get yourself neutral on this subject no matter how hard it is that actually in and itself in and of itself can take prayer Lord I want you have to maybe even come before the Lord and say Lord I want to be neutral on this subject maybe you have someone that you're that that you're young people that you're interested in I want to get neutral on the subject Lord I really want to go with this person but I'm going to get neutral I want to go with whoever you want me to go with amen I want God's choice on the matter I don't want my choice because God sees your future amen and that's who you want to help you make the decision amen go to the next slide for me slide 12 it says course now in most in in my case most of the time wow it's 10:53 uh if it's very important I wait on a vision but many people God doesn't deal with invisions so therefore I wouldn't advise you to do that I don't know if any of you see Visions but I wouldn't advise unless you're a prophet to do it that way because it's just some people that has visions and does it that way when you do something else that I couldn't do maybe is in your way of in the Lord God deals with us different next slide slide 13 and so if I would have uh if I was in your place I I wouldn't have visions from before the Lord I would just wait upon the Lord and say Lord now you show me what the decision is to make and then that's the way that you feel led to do it then wait just a little bit then wait a little bit longer and see which way which sh you lean towards he says now which way the spirit now father in my heart you know it doesn't matter but I want you to know about it and then he goes on to discern this is important friends because then he goes on to discern the spirit of so many people's questions regarding this matter because what happens in this situation is you get yourself in a situation where you don't know the answer and you cannot you cannot find the will of the Lord amen who's ever been in that you you're praying about it you're waiting and then you've waited and then you've wait it and Lord I don't know exactly what to do and he says brother bam says you know that everybody's had had that question before he says um he says what if I chose the wrong thing what if I'm not sure and I chose the wrong thing that's the way he says I do about meeting sometimes I feel kind of led to go this way or that way then I'll follow that way that's the best way to do it cuz it's in prayer then that you're doing the best you can and I believe this my friends as Paul was in in the New Testament was days gone by he was between two Straits which way he would go and he started on the wrong road and he got to the Macedonian call and I believe if you're making a decision for God and you do it the best that you can I believe God will correct you and don't see that you don't go wrong I believe God will do it going to make wrong decisions you're going to take paths that that you messed up but I believe if you're a son or daughter of God God will correct you so if you're not sure you know type it out wait on the Lord but if you're not sure make the decision and then if God is in your life then he will correct you in what you're going to do amen he will show you the way he will show you the path amen he will make it clear to you you just have to be willing to see it from his angle amen and it's it's a just a beautiful place to be as a Believer completely neutral on the subject ready and willing to go whichever way the Lord leads you amen willing to go either way whichever whichever way amen uh then God can can really do a work in your life um just in the my closing comments the Bible says that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom amen Proverbs 9 teaches that and that word fear speaks of reverence amen and I believe in many cases I believe that we fear the the Lord we reverence the Lord enough to save us from our sins enough to help us when we're in trouble enough to do these things but if true wisdom only starts in the Bible what the Bible says it only starts in fear in reverence of him then that shows us that our wisdom in this life starts when we're able to respect God enough to to make our decisions in our life no matter how big no matter how small if you're willing to if you're weighing something you're you're willing to let him make that decision amen we're sometimes so and I I I'm speaking to myself sometimes we're so stubborn in a certain situation you want to go a certain way because you feel like this is the this is the leadership of the Lord but then God shows you that's not the leadership of the Lord you need to go this way with it well I'm stubborn and I feel maybe I need to go this way you need to be willing to let God show you Amen to let God lead you in all things and really that's just the beginning of wisdom amen glory to God let's just pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this day we thank you for the word Lord we pray that you just minister to us Lord from your servant Lord as we father go and move into the service I pray for the the musicians the song leader Lord God we just open up our hearts Lord I just want to receive something from you we love you and we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you
