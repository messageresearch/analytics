[35:55] ask these things in the precious name of
[35:57] jesus christ
[35:59] amen amen amen let's go
[36:02] right to our text this this evening
[36:05] isaiah chapter four verse one and two
[36:09] that's probably gonna be part
[36:10] one of two or three
[36:14] and my topic is the beautiful
[36:17] branch of the last days
[36:21] isaiah four one and two
[36:24] and in that seven women shall take hold
[36:27] of one man saying
[36:29] we will eat our own bread and wear our
[36:31] own apparel
[36:32] only let us be called by thy name to
[36:34] take away our reproach
[36:37] in that day shall the branch of the lord
[36:39] be beautiful and glorious
[36:41] and the fruit of the earth shall be
[36:43] excellent and comely for them
[36:45] that are escaped of israel amen may the
[36:47] lord add the blessing to the reading of
[36:49] his word you can be seated
[36:52] thank you musicians good to have you
[36:54] here brother andrew
[36:56] enjoyed that special
[37:00] amen so
[37:04] i got inspired for this sermon a while
[37:07] back
[37:08] listening to the new album that the
[37:11] brother paul lafontaine and his family
[37:14] put out and i don't know if anybody's
[37:18] has anybody listened to that at all
[37:20] heard of it parts of it there's a song
[37:22] on it they call the beautiful branch of
[37:23] the lord and
[37:25] it's incredible i suggest everybody if
[37:28] you can
[37:29] track it down to take a listen to that
[37:32] but
[37:34] as we were listening to this the first
[37:37] time
[37:37] i didn't even know what happened oh the
[37:39] whole family was listening it
[37:41] at it and we all it was like we all just
[37:43] started crying especially amy and i just
[37:45] something
[37:46] felt like something just busted on the
[37:48] inside of our
[37:49] hearts and and then everything flew fl
[37:52] flowed out through our
[37:54] through our eyes and i think there's
[37:56] something special
[37:58] in these verses and i want i want to
[38:02] i want to show why thank you beautiful
[38:06] branch of the lord you've got two verses
[38:08] they're actually juxtaposed against each
[38:10] other
[38:12] you have the bad woman
[38:16] and you have the good woman let me show
[38:18] you that that's the reality
[38:20] you have seven women said there's going
[38:22] to be
[38:23] in the last days such an aggression
[38:27] that women would have they'll become
[38:30] aggressive they won't be
[38:32] how god made them to be with a meekness
[38:35] and a passiveness but they'll be such an
[38:38] aggression
[38:39] aggressive spirit upon the women
[38:44] in the end time that they will
[38:48] take hold of one man seven women are
[38:51] going to come
[38:51] from here i'm i'm courting you
[38:55] as they say
[38:58] i'm pursuing you i'm chasing after you
[39:02] we're going to eat our own bread we're
[39:04] going to wear our own
[39:05] clothes only let us take our
[39:08] name take your name to take away
[39:12] our reproach they want the benefit
[39:17] of marriage but they want to be
[39:21] they've turned it upside down they want
[39:24] to be
[39:24] in control they want to be the boss they
[39:27] want
[39:28] to be in charge and i think
[39:32] the next verse in that day shall the
[39:34] branch of the lord be beautiful
[39:37] and glorious so on the one hand we have
[39:41] this this branch of the lord that is the
[39:43] bride
[39:44] of jesus christ that's the saints of god
[39:49] and that branch in the last days will be
[39:52] a restored bride will be beautiful
[39:56] and glorious amen so we're talking about
[40:00] women and we're talking about churches
[40:02] right
[40:04] one church says hey i'm i'm in charge
[40:06] here i'm the head
[40:08] i'm in control i'm going to take hold of
[40:10] one man christ
[40:11] and say let me be called by your name to
[40:13] take away my reproach but the reality is
[40:15] they have their own name they have their
[40:18] own purpose they have their own plan
[40:20] and they don't care and that's the
[40:22] condition of one the woman
[40:24] today we have the fruits of feminism
[40:27] that started back in 1850 or so
[40:32] the fruits of feminism what is it
[40:35] this is what the devil has done sisters
[40:38] my sisters he has spoken to you and said
[40:42] you're not normal you're weird it's
[40:46] normal to be
[40:47] an aggressive woman it's normal to be
[40:49] that woman
[40:50] with pants and dressed sexy and
[40:53] out there working in the workplace and
[40:56] getting my own
[40:57] thing and doing my own thing and being
[40:59] an independent woman
[41:01] he's taken that satan has taken that and
[41:04] says that
[41:05] is normal that is good that's out of the
[41:07] pits of hell
[41:10] god made a woman to be a woman why
[41:14] the bride in christ and when that type
[41:16] gets out of its place
[41:18] it's wrong look a woman is not supposed
[41:21] to be
[41:22] a wimp a fearful wimp
[41:25] where would you get that idea but that's
[41:27] what satan's side
[41:29] tries to say gods women
[41:32] sisters ladies are supposed to be where
[41:34] do you find in the bible that the bride
[41:37] is a weak wimp
[41:41] a woman is to be a strong
[41:44] tough fearless
[41:48] lady she doesn't fear the the future
[41:52] the proverb says she laughs at the times
[41:56] to come
[41:57] don't get it wrong being a weaker vessel
[42:01] doesn't mean you're weak
[42:03] you're supposed to be strong in the lord
[42:06] not strong like this
[42:07] seven women taking hold of one man and
[42:09] saying we'll eat our own bread
[42:12] wear our own clothes just give us your
[42:14] name that's not strength
[42:17] that's a woman's weakness when she does
[42:18] that
[42:20] wow when you look at the world today
[42:23] what is the results now we have i'm not
[42:26] in
[42:26] favor of women's sports but
[42:30] with that said with that said what do
[42:33] you have today
[42:34] what's the results of feminism what's
[42:37] the results of putting pants
[42:38] on a woman what's the result of that
[42:41] they don't even nobody
[42:43] even knows what they are anymore not
[42:45] sure if i'm a man i'm not sure if i'm a

[52:30] it's it's witchcraft
[52:33] uh is constantly put before the young
[52:35] people
[52:36] and not only witchcraft uh
[52:40] feminism all these different things is
[52:43] constantly
[52:44] pressurized into the children and don't
[52:47] and don't don't even tell me what
[52:49] happens at a public school what they're
[52:52] trained to learn at
[52:53] 99 of public schools is just absolute
[52:58] vulgarity
[53:00] and this is a generation that's going to
[53:03] answer to god
[53:05] for the perverting of what they've done
[53:07] yeah
[53:10] she's got something hidden in her heart
[53:11] that you don't know nothing about you
[53:13] lost it
[53:14] can never find it don't you call her old
[53:17] fashioned and so forth like that she
[53:19] knows something that you don't know
[53:20] nothing about she's got it
[53:21] she's got hit in her heart
[53:25] there it is she's got hid in her heart
[53:29] amen treasure of decency
[53:32] you don't know one word of it your mammy
[53:34] brought you up like that your pastor
[53:36] permitted it
[53:37] shows where he stands i'm preaching
[53:40] about him
[53:41] right here now amen amen
[53:45] amen so i mentioned before
[53:50] jesus put women in a position in a place
[53:53] that the rabbis of his time
[53:58] never would do that never would do that
[54:01] it wasn't
[54:02] it was there was it was unheard of
[54:05] for a woman to follow along with
[54:09] disciples of a rabbi amen
[54:12] it wasn't permitted it was a shock
[54:16] let's look at this verse mark 15 41 who
[54:20] also
[54:21] when he was in galilee and ministered
[54:24] unto him
[54:25] followed him and ministered unto him and
[54:28] many other women
[54:29] which came up with him unto jerusalem
[54:32] so saying he had disciples that were
[54:35] women that followed him uh oh
[54:40] they didn't like they didn't like that
[54:43] they didn't appreciate that you couldn't
[54:44] go
[54:44] the women had to be totally separate
[54:47] there were things
[54:48] in the law that women weren't even
[54:49] allowed to learn
[54:51] and hear about just things that pertain
[54:53] to the home
[54:54] that's all they were allowed to learn
[54:56] beyond that
[54:58] women were second class citizens
[55:02] her word didn't matter her witness
[55:06] didn't matter when
[55:10] middle eastern culture it takes
[55:13] three or four women to make up the
[55:17] witness of
[55:17] one man in a court case that's the way
[55:20] it was
[55:21] it's the way it still is in many places
[55:24] and so women have
[55:28] less value under
[55:31] other culture societies this was never
[55:34] god's intention and neither and jesus
[55:37] was going to come and correct that
[55:41] now look at this if you don't
[55:48] if you don't understand this sisters if
[55:51] this doesn't make you cry a little bit
[55:53] to see what position he put you in
[55:56] you're not reading it right now when
[55:58] jesus was risen early the first of the
[56:01] day first day of the week
[56:03] he appeared first to mary magdalene out
[56:06] of whom he had cast
[56:08] seven devils now look jesus said i don't
[56:11] care about your culture
[56:13] i don't care about how you look at
[56:15] things
[56:16] i'm going to show i'm going to show you
[56:18] what exactly what i think
[56:20] of your culture and the value that you
[56:23] place upon women
[56:24] i'm going to first appear to mary
[56:25] magdalene and she went
[56:28] and told them that had been with them as
[56:30] they mourned
[56:31] and wept and they when they had heard it
[56:34] that he was alive he had been seen of
[56:36] her
[56:37] believed not
[56:40] believed not jesus sent
[56:44] first met a woman i believe it's a
[56:47] perfect type
[56:48] of the bride of jesus christ and the
[56:51] place
[56:52] that holds in jesus heart
[56:55] he would meet and and and go to this
[56:58] woman and say
[56:59] go tell my disciples i'm risen from the
[57:01] dead
[57:02] and i'll meet them they say it's a woman
[57:11] what was he doing he was teaching them a
[57:13] lesson
[57:14] he wasn't saying women are going to be
[57:16] preachers now
[57:18] that's not what he was saying he was
[57:20] saying women
[57:22] can be a witness women can testify
[57:26] women can can show forth that i'm raised
[57:29] from the dead
[57:30] in their lives
[57:33] john 4 7 there comes a woman of samaria
[57:36] to draw water
[57:37] jesus saith unto her give me to drink
[57:41] he didn't go to meet the mayor of the
[57:43] city he didn't say i must needs go by
[57:45] samaria there was one woman that he had
[57:47] to meet
[57:48] but he knew that that one woman would do
[57:50] something
[57:51] why because everybody knew that
[57:53] ill-famed
[57:54] woman everybody knew that
[57:57] ill-famed woman they knew what kind of a
[58:01] woman she was
[58:02] and so jesus that didn't bother him
[58:06] that didn't upset him he went and met
[58:09] the ill-famed woman the teachers of that
[58:12] day
[58:14] they were too clean too holy they would
[58:17] never come
[58:18] near such a woman ever
[58:22] jesus came to her and what did she do
[58:25] 29 and 30 come see a man which told me
[58:28] all things
[58:29] that ever i did is not this the christ
[58:33] then they went out of the city and came
[58:34] unto him no jesus wasn't making
[58:37] the samaritan woman a preacher but jesus
[58:40] was sending her to testify
[58:43] of what he had done for her of how he
[58:45] had changed her life and forgiven her
[58:48] sin
[58:49] and he knew she wouldn't be quiet and
[58:51] everybody would know
[58:52] say wow something has changed
[58:55] there that ill-famed woman is interested
[58:57] in religion now
[58:59] what happened my goodness she's
[59:03] different than they should
[59:04] then they came out they came out they
[59:07] listened to the woman
[59:08] they came out and what did they do they
[59:10] listened to jesus christ
[59:13] amen such a such a beautiful
[59:17] thing that jesus does to show
[59:20] the value that a sister has
[59:23] amen
[59:30] all right let's get into some of the
[59:32] some of the types and different things
[59:34] revelation 19 1-2
[59:37] and after these things i heard a great
[59:38] voice of much people in heaven saying
[59:41] alleluia salvation and glory and honor
[59:43] and power unto the lord our god
[59:45] for true and righteous are his judgments
[59:47] freeeth judge the great
[59:50] what did i do here i
[59:56] interpose some scriptures here
[1:00:00] can you flip over josh and give me
[1:00:02] revelation 19
[1:00:07] one and two
[1:00:18] excuse me revelation 17 1-2
[1:00:27] all right and there came one of the
[1:00:29] seven angels which had the seven vials
[1:00:32] and taught with me saying unto me come
[1:00:34] hither i will show unto thee the
[1:00:35] judgment of the great
[1:00:37] that sitteth upon many waters with whom
[1:00:39] the kings of the earth have committed
[1:00:40] fornication
[1:00:42] and the inhabitants of the earth have
[1:00:43] been made drunk with the wine of her
[1:00:45] fornication so he carried me away in the
[1:00:47] spirit into the wilderness
[1:00:49] and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet
[1:00:51] colored beast
[1:00:52] full of names of blasphemy or
[1:00:54] blasphemous names having seven heads
[1:00:57] and ten horns and the woman was arrayed
[1:00:59] in purple and scarlet
[1:01:01] and decked with gold and precious stones
[1:01:03] and pearls having a golden cup in her
[1:01:05] hand
[1:01:05] full of abominations and filthiness of
[1:01:07] her fornication
[1:01:09] and upon her forehead was a name written
[1:01:11] mystery babylon
[1:01:12] the great the mother of harlots and
[1:01:14] abominations of the earth next verse
[1:01:16] and i saw the woman drunken with the
[1:01:17] blood of the saints and with the blood
[1:01:19] of the martyrs
[1:01:20] of jesus and when i saw her i wondered
[1:01:22] with great admiration
[1:01:24] next verse and the angel said unto me
[1:01:26] wherefore this thou marvel i will tell
[1:01:28] thee the mystery of the woman
[1:01:30] and of the beast which carrieth her
[1:01:31] which has seven heads and ten
[1:01:34] horns all right you can close that out
[1:01:37] then
[1:01:38] so we have a woman
[1:01:42] riding on a beast
[1:01:45] in other words when when you're riding
[1:01:47] on a beast
[1:01:48] you control the beast and it's it's a
[1:01:52] woman we understand
[1:01:53] it's what is it it's churches it's
[1:01:56] the catholic church the mother
[1:01:59] and the harlots the daughters the
[1:02:01] denominational systems
[1:02:03] they're of the same spirit amen and what
[1:02:05] are they doing
[1:02:06] they're riding a woman riding in
[1:02:09] control not of christ she doesn't
[1:02:12] control christ
[1:02:13] but riding in control of the beast the
[1:02:16] government
[1:02:17] governmental systems the church
[1:02:21] the in charge of
[1:02:24] the government what is it
[1:02:28] feminism it's a perfect type
[1:02:32] in the feminism that we have in our
[1:02:35] world
[1:02:36] today amen it's a
[1:02:39] what is the what is the ultimate
[1:02:43] goal of feminism it's to make a woman
[1:02:46] into a
[1:02:48] you say oh no it's to give her rights
[1:02:50] and do this stop what does it ultimately
[1:02:52] do
[1:02:55] it don't make her a nice person don't
[1:02:57] make her
[1:02:58] don't make her beautiful in god's sight
[1:03:01] it turns her into a ultimately
[1:03:05] a prostitute that that's what she is
[1:03:08] she expresses her right to do as she
[1:03:10] wishes
[1:03:11] by living with how many ever lovers she
[1:03:14] wants to live with
[1:03:16] that's what it comes down to and the
[1:03:17] patriarchy is trying to destroy her life
[1:03:21] by telling her you should just marry one
[1:03:23] man
[1:03:24] and you should be faithful to hear her
[1:03:26] he should be your king
[1:03:28] and she should she should be your queen
[1:03:31] his queen and you guys should
[1:03:34] be faithful to each other oh my goodness
[1:03:36] what it
[1:03:37] how terrible how dare they do that
[1:03:41] crushing the spirits of the women go out
[1:03:44] and sleep with every man and ruin your
[1:03:46] life
[1:03:48] this is the mindset okay they don't
[1:03:51] present it that way
[1:03:53] oh you know a woman should have control
[1:03:56] she needs to have control of her life
[1:03:58] she she should be able to do everything
[1:03:59] a man is able to do
[1:04:01] of course the devil doesn't come and
[1:04:03] present you with a knife and stab you in
[1:04:04] the
[1:04:05] eye he gives you flowers
[1:04:08] and he gets closer and closer and closer
[1:04:11] and then you don't have any eyes
[1:04:12] left the next thing you know
[1:04:16] that's how he works and so don't
[1:04:19] don't think the message
[1:04:24] don't think that the message of feminism
[1:04:25] isn't impacting
[1:04:27] your mind today because it is
[1:04:31] i listen to how all of us have
[1:04:32] conversations
[1:04:34] it impacts even me i don't wanna i don't
[1:04:37] wanna think
[1:04:39] like the world you know you you almost
[1:04:42] find yourself saying well like the old
[1:04:44] days when they used to have like
[1:04:46] gender roles and women were in the
[1:04:48] kitchen and men worked hard and provided
[1:04:52] and
[1:04:54] that's bad that's a bad thing that's
[1:04:58] against
[1:04:59] god it's exactly scripture how many
[1:05:02] quotes
[1:05:03] just go look it up in the table woman's
[1:05:05] places in the
[1:05:06] yeah kitchen well we're gonna be off of
[1:05:09] youtube brother jason
[1:05:13] facebook's next
[1:05:19] but that's that is that's the spirit in
[1:05:21] the world
[1:05:22] that's trying to come and get us
[1:05:26] i'm not saying that there's not other
[1:05:28] reasons sometimes a woman has to work
[1:05:30] but it's other reason it isn't that it
[1:05:32] doesn't have to be the default
[1:05:34] is what it doesn't have to be that's the
[1:05:36] default of the world
[1:05:38] i have to work i have to do this i have
[1:05:40] to have my own paycheck my own bank
[1:05:42] account i got to have control
[1:05:44] over everything okay but
[1:05:47] are you thinking like god thinks
[1:05:50] are you thinking as the world thinks
[1:05:54] are we supposed to be conformed to the
[1:05:56] world
[1:06:00] are we supposed to be transformed by the
[1:06:01] renewing of our mind are we supposed to
[1:06:03] think
[1:06:04] with these thoughts are we supposed to
[1:06:07] think
[1:06:08] with the thoughts that come through the
[1:06:11] internet on
[1:06:13] social media and memes and so forth
[1:06:16] hey hey you're lying to yourself if you
[1:06:19] don't think you're impact
[1:06:20] i am impacted by it but we have to fight
[1:06:23] against it because we're called not to
[1:06:25] be conformed but to be transformed
[1:06:27] by the renewing of our mind that means
[1:06:30] we're going to have the mind of christ
[1:06:32] and think as the word thinks we don't
[1:06:34] have
[1:06:35] this is another great thing we don't
[1:06:37] have a we don't have any
[1:06:38] rights when we come to christ we
[1:06:41] surrender
[1:06:42] our rights to ourselves that doesn't
[1:06:44] mean you surrender your rights to the
[1:06:46] pastor
[1:06:47] some churches teach that that's not what
[1:06:49] it's saying
[1:06:51] it's saying you're surrendering your
[1:06:52] rights to the word
[1:06:54] amen and we're conforming our lives to
[1:06:58] the word period we don't have a right
[1:07:02] to think our own way if you don't like
[1:07:05] that
[1:07:06] take it up with the lord i'm not saying
[1:07:08] you have to think the way i think
[1:07:09] i'm saying you have to think the way
[1:07:12] this bible teaches us
[1:07:15] to think and the church
[1:07:18] has been destroyed and eaten
[1:07:21] by feminism amen and don't think
[1:07:25] satan's not trying to eat
[1:07:28] up this message amen with the feministic
[1:07:32] spirit it's of the world it's of the
[1:07:35] devil
[1:07:36] there's an order that god has created
[1:07:39] the man is the head
[1:07:43] the woman is to submit to the man
[1:07:48] amen amen is that okay
[1:07:52] is that okay to say what the bible says
[1:07:54] still
[1:07:56] amen and yet we know it we know that
[1:07:59] it's a partnership
[1:08:00] that it's a team yeah that we work
[1:08:03] together that we
[1:08:04] we sacrifice for each other
[1:08:08] right amen you know i'd be a fool
[1:08:11] not to consider the counsel of my wife
[1:08:16] she knows me better than anyone else and
[1:08:19] i know that she's a wise woman
[1:08:21] so i'm not a fool right
[1:08:24] so and and you know you have you have a
[1:08:27] you have a team
[1:08:28] you have you work together and yet we
[1:08:32] know the responsibility
[1:08:34] of headship leadership falls not to the
[1:08:36] woman
[1:08:37] but to the man right
[1:08:41] and there's a way there's a way a sister
[1:08:44] walks with the lord with a husband
[1:08:48] that is so incredibly beautiful that is
[1:08:51] such a
[1:08:52] picture of every man
[1:08:55] in in christ every one of us
[1:08:58] of how we need to listen and hear and
[1:09:01] submit and say it's
[1:09:02] jesus it's not what i want to do it's
[1:09:04] not what i think
[1:09:06] i want to do what you want i want to i
[1:09:08] want to do what you want to do
[1:09:10] this is what's going on this is what i'm
[1:09:12] feeling this is what i'm seeing
[1:09:14] and he says i i understand i understand
[1:09:17] we're going in this direction you may
[1:09:20] not you may not like it but just
[1:09:21] just just stay in my presence
[1:09:26] and then he starts to speak and deal
[1:09:28] with us and conform us
[1:09:30] to himself and there's such a beautiful
[1:09:33] relationship that happens with christ
[1:09:36] and his bride in that
[1:09:39] and it's the same thing for for a
[1:09:42] husband and wife
[1:09:44] and the position that a woman has
[1:09:48] in christ it's beautiful yeah it's
[1:09:50] absolutely beautiful and it's supposed
[1:09:52] to be it is
[1:09:53] designed to be fulfilling
[1:09:58] it's not designed to be easy for a woman
[1:10:02] but it's designed to be fulfilling and
[1:10:04] it's the same for a man it's not
[1:10:05] designed to be easy
[1:10:07] for a man but it's designed to be
[1:10:09] fulfilling amen
[1:10:10] when you watch and see a man he's being
[1:10:12] led around by his nose by a woman
[1:10:15] he's not happy neither is she
[1:10:18] she knows that's that's how it's
[1:10:20] supposed to be a true woman of god
[1:10:23] men step up and lead your home so your
[1:10:26] wife doesn't have to
[1:10:27] right amen
[1:10:32] but that's that is our
[1:10:36] denominational program of today
[1:10:39] they've left christ out
[1:10:42] amen and said we're in charge here
[1:10:46] we're we're we're the women we're going
[1:10:49] to have our own
[1:10:50] account we're going to have our own
[1:10:53] program just let us be called by our
[1:10:56] names that our
[1:10:56] reproach will be taken away let us be
[1:10:59] called after the name of christ well
[1:11:00] they're never
[1:11:01] they aren't called after the name of
[1:11:02] christ it's another a different
[1:11:04] christ they've committed adultery
[1:11:07] against jesus christ and gone
[1:11:11] the ways of feminism
[1:11:15] but not so with the bride of jesus
[1:11:17] christ
[1:11:18] go back and give me revelation 19 1 on
[1:11:21] the
[1:11:24] scripture
[1:11:31] back on the um yeah
[1:11:36] sorry everybody i'm slowing it down
[1:11:43] sometimes you copy and paste incorrectly
[1:11:47] and after these things i heard a great
[1:11:49] voice of much people in heaven saying
[1:11:50] alleluia salvation and glory and honor
[1:11:53] and power
[1:11:54] unto the lord our god for true and
[1:11:56] righteous are his judgments for he hath
[1:11:58] judged
[1:11:59] the great which did corrupt the
[1:12:02] earth with her fornication and avenged
[1:12:04] the blood of his servants at her hand
[1:12:06] and again they said alleluia and her
[1:12:08] smoke rose up forever and ever
[1:12:10] and the four and twenty elders and the
[1:12:12] four beasts fell down and worshiped god
[1:12:13] that sat on the throne saying amen
[1:12:15] alleluia
[1:12:17] and a voice came out of the throne
[1:12:18] saying praise our god all ye servants
[1:12:20] and ye that fear him both small and
[1:12:22] great and i heard as
[1:12:24] as it were a voice of a great multitude
[1:12:26] in the voice of many waters and this
[1:12:28] voice of mighty thunderings saying
[1:12:30] alleluia for the lord god
[1:12:32] omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and
[1:12:35] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:12:37] marriage of the lamb
[1:12:38] is come and his wife hath made herself
[1:12:42] ready amen and to her was granted that
[1:12:45] she should be arrayed
[1:12:46] in fine linen clean and white for the
[1:12:49] fine linen
[1:12:51] is the righteousness of
[1:12:54] saints amen
[1:12:58] so here's the bride she has a garment on
[1:13:02] and it the garment that she's wearing
[1:13:05] is fine linen
[1:13:08] it's clean and white we saw the the
[1:13:11] what it was she wearing purple
[1:13:13] decked with gold silver and jewels
[1:13:16] what was it showing her
[1:13:20] exaltation it's a garment of
[1:13:23] pride right then we have
[1:13:27] here a white garment
[1:13:30] clean and white it's righteous it's holy
[1:13:34] it's representing
[1:13:36] purity it's representing
[1:13:39] her relationship to the lamb of god
[1:13:42] right it's a relationship of
[1:13:46] cleanness and purity
[1:13:49] and so you see that juxtaposed
[1:13:52] against the woman the
[1:13:56] and the bride one drunken with blood
[1:14:00] i mean you can't get much of a more
[1:14:03] graphic
[1:14:04] statement drunk with blood talk about
[1:14:08] exalting herself and saying i sit as a
[1:14:10] queen
[1:14:11] and have need of nothing and yet here is
[1:14:14] the other bride she's wearing
[1:14:16] fine linen clean and white and does he
[1:14:19] go on to read
[1:14:20] in her humility the righteous the her
[1:14:23] her fight the
[1:14:24] her clothing is her righteousness it's
[1:14:26] her holiness
[1:14:27] amen it's the fact that she's set apart
[1:14:30] unto the lamb of god only
[1:14:34] right and then we see the results for
[1:14:36] her
[1:14:37] who humbled herself to the lamb what are
[1:14:40] the results
[1:14:41] it's not drunk with the blood no
[1:14:45] it says watch her come down from heaven
[1:14:47] clothed with
[1:14:48] the glory of god all the
[1:14:52] precious jewels in revelation 4
[1:14:55] that expressed the presence of god now
[1:14:58] they're in the bride
[1:15:03] the result of what going god's
[1:15:07] way following god's
[1:15:10] order first timothy 2 verse 9 says
[1:15:14] and go back to the power point in like
[1:15:16] manner also that women adorn themselves
[1:15:19] in modest apparel
[1:15:23] that word apparel is the word catastole
[1:15:25] it means a long dress
[1:15:27] a modest long dress with shame-facedness
[1:15:30] and sobriety oh man here he goes again
[1:15:39] yeah there we go with shame-facedness
[1:15:42] and sobriety
[1:15:44] so this is this is the the bride
[1:15:48] she's adorned she's dressed herself in
[1:15:50] something that's modest
[1:15:53] see the bible never says talks about
[1:15:55] clothes how a woman should wear clothing
[1:15:57] ah
[1:15:58] it says it right here amen women should
[1:16:01] adorn
[1:16:02] themselves dress themselves in modest
[1:16:05] apparel
[1:16:06] a long dress if you want to understand
[1:16:08] in scriptural speaking
[1:16:10] a long dress if you look at all the
[1:16:11] history all the understanding of these
[1:16:14] different words it's speaking of a dress
[1:16:16] that goes
[1:16:17] below always below the knee
[1:16:21] all right and what is it what is that
[1:16:24] modest
[1:16:25] long dress supposed to be characterized
[1:16:27] as next he says with
[1:16:30] shame-facedness and sobriety so you're
[1:16:32] adorning of yourself
[1:16:34] you adorn yourself on the outside but
[1:16:37] you adorn yourself on the inside
[1:16:39] let the outside reflect what is on the
[1:16:42] inside
[1:16:43] on the inside is shame-facedness
[1:16:46] oh boy this guy's so old-fashioned
[1:16:49] shame-facedness really
[1:16:52] yup yup that's a bible verse in case you
[1:16:55] didn't know
[1:17:00] might not be popular in 20th and 21st
[1:17:03] century america
[1:17:05] but it's popular with the bride of
[1:17:06] christ yes amen
[1:17:09] shame-facedness what does it mean it's
[1:17:12] it means dressing with a sense of shame
[1:17:14] or honor
[1:17:16] if you understand there's cultures where
[1:17:18] your behavior
[1:17:19] impacts your whole family everyone
[1:17:22] around you your extended family
[1:17:24] and everything is operated sort of in
[1:17:26] shame and honor so if a woman would
[1:17:28] dress like a
[1:17:28] prostitute it would be a shameful thing
[1:17:30] not just to her but to her whole family
[1:17:32] she would dress be honored and honorable
[1:17:35] it would be an
[1:17:36] honor and a blessing to her whole family
[1:17:38] that's sort of the part of where the
[1:17:40] word is coming from
[1:17:41] it also speaks of being shy
[1:17:44] my goodness that's the opposite of that
[1:17:47] woman those seven women in
[1:17:49] isaiah 4 1. seven women are going to
[1:17:52] take hold of one man
[1:17:54] say give me give me and here it is
[1:17:59] that a the real godly woman would
[1:18:02] be shy what happened to that
[1:18:05] that nature that a woman used to have
[1:18:08] that
[1:18:09] it's not so anymore and sobriety speaks
[1:18:12] speaks of being sober minded
[1:18:17] amen let's look at the commentary
[1:18:20] of john gill on this
[1:18:24] he says that women adorn themselves now
[1:18:27] i
[1:18:27] i i bring these commentaries and things
[1:18:30] like this is because people say
[1:18:32] and not you but people perhaps on the
[1:18:34] internet will say
[1:18:36] uh they're just quoting brother branham
[1:18:37] it's just it's just
[1:18:39] branham's interpretation of things all
[1:18:42] right it's not
[1:18:44] it's not he's just gathering together
[1:18:46] what was already there
[1:18:47] yeah and you can see all of these things
[1:18:49] so i'm bringing john gill not because
[1:18:52] john gill was a great vindicated
[1:18:53] theologian
[1:18:55] we already have a vindicated prophet but
[1:18:58] this is
[1:18:58] you should see and and i think sometimes
[1:19:01] when
[1:19:02] people struggle have a difficulty they
[1:19:04] just point it on and say
[1:19:06] oh that's just those
[1:19:09] people they're following that man no
[1:19:12] it's it's not just that it's not just
[1:19:15] that and yet that's okay because the man
[1:19:17] was vindicated
[1:19:19] but with that said i think this helps
[1:19:21] your some people's faith sometimes
[1:19:24] so that women adorn themselves in modest
[1:19:26] apparel the word rendered apparel
[1:19:28] signifies a long robe
[1:19:30] which reaches down to the feet and the
[1:19:32] word translated modest signifies that
[1:19:33] which is clean
[1:19:35] neat and decent yeah beautiful and
[1:19:37] ornamental
[1:19:38] and the same and the sense of the
[1:19:40] apostle is that he would not have them
[1:19:41] to
[1:19:42] come to public worship and rags and
[1:19:44] dirty filthy garments but their
[1:19:46] bodies should be covered with clean and
[1:19:48] decent raiment
[1:19:51] question the answer is number one
[1:19:52] brother branham does first timothy
[1:19:54] 2 9 mean a woman cannot braid her hair
[1:19:58] does broid mean braided hair now look
[1:20:01] sister
[1:20:01] i'm glad that followed this i never
[1:20:03] fixed it there but it just followed that
[1:20:05] good
[1:20:06] notice a braided hair in that day was
[1:20:07] the sign of a street woman
[1:20:09] that's what she done braided her hair
[1:20:11] and paul said to christians now that
[1:20:12] adorning not let it
[1:20:13] of a braided or broided braid is
[1:20:16] abroided and braid is the same thing to
[1:20:18] braid the hair because
[1:20:19] it looked like the rest of the world now
[1:20:21] you're supposed to not look like the
[1:20:22] world
[1:20:23] or act like the world see the women are
[1:20:25] supposed to be different there
[1:20:27] see now no now braiding the hair now
[1:20:30] today
[1:20:30] braided hair is pretty and it's a long
[1:20:32] ways from the fashion
[1:20:34] of the world amen
[1:20:40] genesis 3 7 we have our first fashion
[1:20:43] designers
[1:20:44] on display and the eyes of them both
[1:20:47] were opened and they knew that they were
[1:20:49] naked and they sewed fig leaves together
[1:20:52] and made themselves
[1:20:54] says aprons but if you look up the
[1:20:56] meaning of that word
[1:20:57] it literally means loincloth
[1:21:01] they sewed themselves together a
[1:21:02] loincloth
[1:21:04] all right then what happened god came
[1:21:08] down the presence of the lord was in the
[1:21:10] presence of the voice of the lord was in
[1:21:11] the garden said adam where are you
[1:21:14] they hid why did they hide they sinned
[1:21:16] and they knew they were naked
[1:21:18] god says adam where are you he comes out
[1:21:21] to him why didn't who told you
[1:21:25] he says we hid because we were naked so
[1:21:28] the loincloth
[1:21:30] wasn't sufficient it wasn't sufficient
[1:21:33] covering it wasn't a pro
[1:21:34] it wasn't god approved clothing
[1:21:39] he it let them know that they were still
[1:21:43] naked even with the loincloth so what
[1:21:45] god does
[1:21:46] 3 21. god says you guys are not
[1:21:50] good fashion designers you're sinners
[1:21:54] your sinners and your your your bikini
[1:21:58] design
[1:21:59] needs to be thrown in the trash can
[1:22:02] that's just
[1:22:02] that's underwear that's undergarments
[1:22:06] we're not going to wear that on the
[1:22:07] outside
[1:22:08] says them to adam also and to his wife
[1:22:09] to the lord god
[1:22:11] make coats the hebrew word is coutinet
[1:22:14] of skins and clothed
[1:22:17] them so god
[1:22:20] clothed the man and the woman how did he
[1:22:23] clothe them
[1:22:25] and this is from um the amplified
[1:22:29] classic version ver adam also and for
[1:22:31] his wife the lord god made long
[1:22:34] coats of skins and clothes that clothed
[1:22:37] them do you see that word long there
[1:22:39] there's a reason they put that in there
[1:22:42] from kutanet this is about coutinet the
[1:22:45] hebrew word
[1:22:46] the international standard bible
[1:22:47] encyclopedia says here the coat
[1:22:50] hebrew coutinet was the ordinary inner
[1:22:52] garment ward by the jew of the day
[1:22:54] in which he did the work of the day it
[1:22:56] resembled the roman tunic corresponding
[1:22:58] most nearly
[1:22:59] to our long shirt reaching below the
[1:23:02] knees
[1:23:03] always and in case it was designed for
[1:23:06] dress occasions
[1:23:07] reaching almost to the ground all right
[1:23:10] so reaching below the knees always so
[1:23:13] when you're sitting down
[1:23:15] it's still reaching below the knees yes
[1:23:18] amen
[1:23:21] beauty that's another thing that we saw
[1:23:23] earlier
[1:23:25] beauty there's two ways to look at
[1:23:28] beauty
[1:23:29] there's the way the world looks at
[1:23:30] beauty which is ultimately
[1:23:33] satanic and there's a way that god
[1:23:36] looks at the term beauty and
[1:23:40] young people and middle-aged people
[1:23:43] and old people everyone listening
[1:23:48] even three-year-olds addie are you
[1:23:50] listening
[1:23:53] god divine defines luther says nope
[1:23:55] she's not
[1:23:59] god will be the one
[1:24:03] that says i will define beauty to you
[1:24:05] thank you very much
[1:24:07] amen he's not he doesn't want it to be
[1:24:10] defined by the world
[1:24:13] doesn't want it to be defined by the
[1:24:15] devil
[1:24:17] that's what is de facto for all of you
[1:24:21] that's what's de facto the world is
[1:24:24] defining
[1:24:24] it if you exist on planet earth
[1:24:29] the world is defining what beautiful
[1:24:32] is and it doesn't matter how old you are
[1:24:35] you will see that and you'll start
[1:24:38] comparing yourself with that
[1:24:41] and it's a great danger because
[1:24:44] there is something that's in all of us
[1:24:46] we want to fit in
[1:24:49] just make sure your definition
[1:24:53] is correct amen it's according to god's
[1:24:56] word one according it's according to
[1:24:59] god's word
[1:25:02] two that you're not inserting
[1:25:06] satanic values into that viewpoint i'm
[1:25:10] not exceeding
[1:25:11] values i hate satan okay
[1:25:14] all right i get what you're saying
[1:25:18] but but the world
[1:25:21] using magazines and entertainment
[1:25:26] is giving a definition to you oh i don't
[1:25:29] listen to that
[1:25:31] you do you do
[1:25:34] because you're not born with the holy
[1:25:35] ghost
[1:25:38] you're not born with the holy ghost that
[1:25:41] comes
[1:25:41] later when you get converted so when
[1:25:44] you're little
[1:25:45] and mom and dad you have a
[1:25:46] responsibility
[1:25:49] what are your kids looking at on tv
[1:25:53] you say we're message believers we don't
[1:25:54] have tv you have tv so stop it
[1:26:04] you have tv you're carrying tvs around
[1:26:06] and when your kid gets fussy you hand
[1:26:07] them a tv
[1:26:08] out of your pocket just make sure
[1:26:12] that with that teaching that they're
[1:26:14] getting
[1:26:15] that you're giving them god's teaching
[1:26:17] yes amen
[1:26:20] it doesn't and that doesn't mean bring
[1:26:21] them to just bring them to church
[1:26:24] that means every day be aware
[1:26:27] be aware of what your kids are talking
[1:26:30] about
[1:26:30] yeah be aware of what they're looking at
[1:26:35] of what they're feeding on especially
[1:26:38] in the formative years as it gets older
[1:26:41] you lose control of that
[1:26:43] and it's it's almost impossible
[1:26:47] to keep up but the re in the formative
[1:26:50] years
[1:26:50] you be the teacher of right and wrong
[1:26:54] and know what they're doing on devices
[1:26:57] and look at their chats
[1:27:00] and look at what they're looking at and
[1:27:02] talk to them
[1:27:03] and talk to the when you're talking to
[1:27:05] them about it talk in a way
[1:27:07] that conversation is open that they feel
[1:27:10] comfortable
[1:27:11] coming to you always not that they feel
[1:27:14] mom and dad are always preaching at me
[1:27:16] and condemning me
[1:27:18] but that mom and dad are listening to me
[1:27:22] and then teaching me and the teaching
[1:27:24] comes from
[1:27:25] a heart of i just want things to be in
[1:27:28] order in my home
[1:27:30] leave that away it should be a heart of
[1:27:34] love for your children you don't want
[1:27:37] them to be destroyed
[1:27:39] with the world not a heart of
[1:27:42] well i just have to have things in order
[1:27:44] that's about you you have an issue
[1:27:47] why why are you so worried about you you
[1:27:50] should have it in order in your own life
[1:27:54] but you should teach and instruct your
[1:27:56] children
[1:27:58] and don't just leave them to be raised
[1:28:00] by disney
[1:28:03] and apps and this and that
[1:28:06] you're not going to get away from it
[1:28:08] just be involved
[1:28:11] i wish we could all move out and get rid
[1:28:14] of internet and we
[1:28:16] just write letters to each other and
[1:28:19] maybe
[1:28:19] send messengers back and forth i don't
[1:28:21] know like literal human
[1:28:22] messengers
[1:28:25] and we're not that's never going to
[1:28:28] happen
[1:28:30] that's not the reality that we live in
[1:28:33] if
[1:28:33] please take time to define for your
[1:28:36] children
[1:28:38] what's right and wrong what is satanic
[1:28:40] values when they're looking at
[1:28:42] images and things that they know this is
[1:28:45] a bad thing
[1:28:46] yeah why is it a bad thing because dad
[1:28:49] says so
[1:28:50] no teach them
[1:28:53] instruct take time
[1:28:56] take time there you're the most precious
[1:28:58] commodity
[1:29:00] you have in your life if you're a parent
[1:29:03] is your children amen outside of your
[1:29:07] wife
[1:29:08] outside of christ they're your
[1:29:10] responsibility
[1:29:11] and they can't be given to somebody else
[1:29:14] they can't be pushed off
[1:29:15] on sunday school teacher and the
[1:29:17] preacher
[1:29:18] that's f that's fine and god works for
[1:29:21] that
[1:29:22] but the best teacher
[1:29:25] is mom and dad be involved
[1:29:29] be very very involved have
[1:29:33] lots and lots of conversations with your
[1:29:35] kids and start it when they're little
[1:29:39] amen what am i talking about
[1:29:44] the holy spirit is is uh taking control
[1:29:47] of me i can't i don't even know
[1:29:49] i literally have no idea how the rabbit
[1:29:52] trail got to that point
[1:29:56] shame-facedness and sobriety
[1:30:00] there's there's a way that god defines
[1:30:02] beauty
[1:30:04] shame-facedness and sobriety that's a
[1:30:07] treasure
[1:30:08] yeah that's a beautiful that's a
[1:30:09] beautiful thing in god's sight
[1:30:12] it shouldn't make us go ooh that's so
[1:30:14] 18th century
[1:30:17] that should say that's bible that's what
[1:30:19] i want in my life
[1:30:22] sister that's what you should want in
[1:30:23] your life you don't want to be
[1:30:25] sexy like beyonce and kardashians
[1:30:29] you want to be the woman that christ has
[1:30:32] designed you to be why because
[1:30:35] that that will give you real
[1:30:38] happiness real joy and you'll be in the
[1:30:41] place and the position
[1:30:43] god has ordained you to be you'll have
[1:30:46] trouble
[1:30:47] everyone has troubles billionaires
[1:30:50] have troubles just multiplied way more
[1:30:52] than you
[1:30:55] it doesn't make life everyone on a
[1:30:57] fallen planet
[1:30:58] has struggles has difficulties have
[1:31:00] trials
[1:31:01] be in a place where you have a
[1:31:03] supernatural
[1:31:05] eternal resource you can call upon
[1:31:08] to deliver you to heal you to touch your
[1:31:11] heart when you're broken
[1:31:14] don't be in a position where you have
[1:31:16] nothing all you have is emptiness
[1:31:19] that's what the models of this world
[1:31:23] will bring you towards and that's why i
[1:31:25] say it's demonic
[1:31:27] it's not of god what does satan look at
[1:31:31] satan came to jesus
[1:31:34] through who peter peter
[1:31:38] he says i'm gonna go to the cross be
[1:31:40] killed third day raised again
[1:31:42] may it never be so peter says
[1:31:45] jesus says get behind me satan you
[1:31:48] don't savor the things that are of god
[1:31:51] but the things that are of men
[1:31:55] that's that's significant why is that
[1:31:57] significant
[1:31:58] what are the things that are man man
[1:32:01] looks
[1:32:02] on the outward appearance but the lord
[1:32:05] looks at the heart what does that mean
[1:32:09] the lord looks at the inner man the
[1:32:11] heart condition
[1:32:12] that's in front of him the heart
[1:32:15] condition produces
[1:32:16] everything else in your life the heart
[1:32:20] condition produced a soul
[1:32:23] who didn't obey the word of god right
[1:32:28] the heart condition pushed produced a
[1:32:30] david
[1:32:31] who when he sandy repented quick
[1:32:35] god looks at the heart he looked at the
[1:32:38] heart of david
[1:32:39] he didn't samuel samuel a prophet
[1:32:43] was sent to choose the next anoint the
[1:32:45] next king
[1:32:47] the lord had to warn him why because
[1:32:49] david had some pretty handsome brothers
[1:32:52] tall strong and handsome tall dark and
[1:32:54] handsome
[1:32:55] and he went and said the lord said don't
[1:32:58] now sam
[1:32:58] samuel don't look at the outward
[1:33:00] appearance
[1:33:01] man looks at the outward appearance but
[1:33:04] the lord
[1:33:05] looks on the inside he looks at the
[1:33:08] heart he looks at the kind of character
[1:33:10] that man is what do you want to look at
[1:33:13] young people
[1:33:14] all of us what do you want to look at
[1:33:17] character
[1:33:18] the heart that's what god values i've
[1:33:21] got
[1:33:22] a lot more we'll bring it to a closer
[1:33:25] musicians if you'd come
[1:33:30] god is looking at the heart so when we
[1:33:33] are preaching about modesty
[1:33:36] modesty is not just an outward condition
[1:33:39] anybody
[1:33:40] any woman can conform themselves to
[1:33:44] message standards right
[1:33:47] anyone can be a fake that's not
[1:33:51] they're not at the lord is not asking
[1:33:52] for fake people
[1:33:54] he's act asking for real people
[1:33:57] and the it's the condition of the heart
[1:34:00] that the lord is looking at
[1:34:03] that's what he's that's what he's
[1:34:04] looking to and when he wants to see
[1:34:06] modesty
[1:34:07] he's pointing at the heart
[1:34:10] ma adorn themselves in modest apparel
[1:34:13] with shame-facedness and sobriety
[1:34:15] he puts two things together he puts the
[1:34:17] outward
[1:34:19] appearance and the inward condition the
[1:34:22] shame-facedness and sobriety
[1:34:25] would do what it would produce
[1:34:28] a woman with a modest long dress
[1:34:31] as that scripture says and so
[1:34:37] pay a little a little less attention
[1:34:40] to the what you look on the outside
[1:34:43] and pay a lot more attention to the
[1:34:46] condition
[1:34:47] of your heart because that's what god
[1:34:49] values
[1:34:50] that's what god is looking for and if
[1:34:53] if you're having a struggle if you're
[1:34:55] struggling perhaps with
[1:34:57] modesty go a little bit deeper
[1:35:00] and say lord this problem is not
[1:35:05] just my outward conformity that's not as
[1:35:09] important the problem is in my heart
[1:35:12] lord deal with my heart touch my heart
[1:35:14] may my value
[1:35:16] the things that i value not be what the
[1:35:18] world values
[1:35:19] but the things that god values
[1:35:23] that's what's more important that's what
[1:35:25] god
[1:35:26] is looking at and looking for is looking
[1:35:28] at the condition of your heart
[1:35:31] now denominational people
[1:35:34] use that to say therefore i can do
[1:35:37] whatever i want to on the outside
[1:35:39] that's not what i'm meaning god is
[1:35:43] looking at your heart
[1:35:44] why because out of your heart flows your
[1:35:47] actions
[1:35:49] and so evil actions
[1:35:52] are the physical manifestation of an
[1:35:55] evil heart
[1:35:58] godly actions on the outside are the
[1:36:01] physical
[1:36:02] manifestation of a heart that's been
[1:36:05] changed that's been conformed
[1:36:08] transformed by the word of god and let's
[1:36:12] stand
[1:36:18] gracious father we come to you lord and
[1:36:20] we ask that your holy spirit would
[1:36:23] move upon us now lord
[1:36:26] convict our hearts
[1:36:29] help us lord those places where maybe
[1:36:32] we've
[1:36:34] conformed ourselves a little bit to the
[1:36:35] world lord may we
[1:36:38] may we come to your presence lord and
[1:36:40] say touch my heart
[1:36:43] change my heart make me more like jesus
[1:36:47] christ
[1:36:48] make me more in his image that i would
[1:36:52] be a
[1:36:53] a better reflection that i would have
[1:36:55] more peace in my life that i have more
[1:36:57] joy
[1:36:58] in my life father we just want to commit

[1:44:23] any testimonies tonight we got hand up
[1:44:26] over there
[1:44:33] um so back in late june early july you
[1:44:37] know we had byc
[1:44:38] uh which is the first uic we've had
[1:44:40] since 2019.
[1:44:42] so i know a lot of youth were really
[1:44:43] really looking forward to it really
[1:44:45] including me
[1:44:46] and this year most of my friend groups
[1:44:48] are able to go because most of my
[1:44:50] friends go to like
[1:44:50] la camp or elf camp in arizona or just
[1:44:54] other camps that happen
[1:44:55] and this year basically my whole friend
[1:44:57] group was able to go
[1:44:59] and we were all talking before camp and
[1:45:01] everyone was telling me like things they
[1:45:02] wanted out of camp and
[1:45:03] just over the course of the camp it was
[1:45:05] really cool to see just
[1:45:06] all of those things happen for everyone
[1:45:08] praise the lord and it was a really big
[1:45:10] blessing to see that and
[1:45:12] this camp more than any other i was
[1:45:13] praying for my friends more than myself
[1:45:15] and to see all those things happen was
[1:45:17] really encouraging
[1:45:18] and i think it was the last night me and
[1:45:21] sarah were outside and we heard brother
[1:45:22] mike sievert who is
[1:45:24] one of the brothers who hosts the camp
[1:45:25] talking to another older brother
[1:45:27] and they were both talking about how
[1:45:28] this year is the biggest revival that
[1:45:30] camp has had since 1988.
[1:45:32] wow so it was just really cool praise
[1:45:34] the lord hallelujah
[1:45:36] thank you lord
[1:45:41] anybody else oh my hands are going up
[1:45:46] after you're done you pass it back to
[1:45:47] sister gene um
[1:45:49] last week i testified about my sister
[1:45:51] having blood work that came back
[1:45:53] really great like miraculously but i
[1:45:56] forgot to mention that i had blood work
[1:45:58] done too
[1:45:59] and for the first time in years
[1:46:02] everything came back totally
[1:46:03] great and my blood pressure was the
[1:46:06] lowest it been since before teddy was
[1:46:07] born so almost 11 years
[1:46:10] so um you know i had a
[1:46:13] treatment on friday and i had a bad
[1:46:14] reaction to it and the devil
[1:46:16] you know tried to knock me down but i'm
[1:46:18] not looking at those circumstances i
[1:46:19] know my healing's coming god's given me
[1:46:21] so much
[1:46:22] and keep praying amen hallelujah
[1:46:27] thank you lord
[1:46:30] well first of all i just want to thank
[1:46:32] everybody last year a year ago i was in
[1:46:35] the state of washington
[1:46:36] and i got a notice that i had to move
[1:46:39] which was quite a shock
[1:46:40] and i had just a short amount of time to
[1:46:44] get home
[1:46:45] find a place get moved there's no way i
[1:46:48] could have done it
[1:46:50] and the church helped katie and martha
[1:46:53] work themselves
[1:46:54] ragged and debbie and jason and y'all
[1:46:56] and everything
[1:46:58] well when it first happened they
[1:46:59] notified jason they didn't notify me
[1:47:03] which was strange because i was on good
[1:47:05] talking terms to the people i rented
[1:47:07] from
[1:47:08] and uh but anyway they notified him and
[1:47:11] i had okay you got to come back and do
[1:47:13] all that it's kind of shocked me
[1:47:17] you know it really i thought okay i'll

[1:47:21] know
[1:47:22] it was just perfect had a wonderful
[1:47:24] neighbor beside of me

[1:47:29] said
[1:47:30] we keep an eye on you and they did they

[1:47:40] least another month they said no no no
[1:47:42] the people that owns it are moving back
[1:47:45] so they had to have it
[1:47:47] they failed to tell me that the people
[1:47:50] were coming back is what had happened
[1:47:52] and so anyway my daughter
[1:47:56] and eddie's sister who does a lot of
[1:47:59] real estate
