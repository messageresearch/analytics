[22:36] hours out of your head I believe it was
[22:38] a great value uh to the Lord's bride
[22:41] amen so we're thankful to the Lord for
[22:44] that we hope to do it again next year if
[22:47] we're here we hope we're not here so we
[22:49] hope we don't do it next year but if
[22:52] we're here we do plan to do it again and
[22:55] we invite you all to come back I'd like
[22:57] to say bring somebody but you won't be
[22:59] able to because the camp was full within
[23:01] about an hour and we had 75 people on a
[23:05] waiting list we just had to turn it off
[23:07] and I apologize to all of those who
[23:09] didn't get to come so just next year
[23:12] have your trigger finger ready and be
[23:15] ready when the registration opens and
[23:17] click quickly amen use use a sniper app
[23:20] and just you know click five times for
[23:22] five of your friends amen and uh we we
[23:26] hope that uh to be able and I I'm I'm
[23:30] you know we this this Camp was a lot
[23:32] more costly and we were able by the help
[23:35] of the Lord to subsidize your price amen
[23:39] and the price of the counselors I would
[23:41] have loved to have subsidized
[23:42] everybody's price I just couldn't afford
[23:44] it and uh the team is telling me already
[23:47] next year brother Jason we're going to
[23:48] have to you know charge what we're
[23:51] getting charged and I haven't agreed to
[23:53] that so you pray for me to stand strong
[23:56] against all my team amen
[23:58] praise the Lord I haven't agreed to do
[24:00] that yet so uh I hope next year by the
[24:03] help of the Lord hey I tell you what you
[24:05] can do they sent me an announcement said
[24:08] concessions are half price
[24:10] today so don't don't run out now have it
[24:12] for half price and if you get at the
[24:14] back of the line you might get it free I
[24:16] don't know I'm just saying don't quote
[24:18] me on that amen I'll deny it but but
[24:22] amen and so hey you know what that does
[24:24] that helps that helps me our our
[24:26] concessions and hey how about that
[24:28] gourmet coffee bar wow
[24:34] wow and I'd like to thank brother Kenny
[24:39] and uh sister Caitlyn who are the owners
[24:42] of the Urban Brew and sister Anita now
[24:45] working with them and they came here and
[24:47] worked uh tirelessly that coffee bar
[24:49] just stayed hopping around the clock and
[24:53] uh brother Ken and uh sister Nita and
[24:55] sister Caitlyn uh donated all the
[24:59] supplies everything that made your
[25:01] coffee they donated and and all of the
[25:05] sales that everything you bought goes
[25:08] back into our fund to help offset some
[25:10] of the subsidy the subsidy to have all
[25:12] y'all here was about 17 grand and so go
[25:16] buy some hot chocolate when you leave
[25:17] here go buy some more coffee go get a
[25:20] candy bar go do something and uh help
[25:23] help me get some of that back we're
[25:24] willing to lose I think you're worth it
[25:27] because if if I if it's our loss but if
[25:29] it's your gain then I just say blessed
[25:30] be the name of the Lord amen amen God
[25:33] bless
[25:39] you to all of my uh team members to all
[25:43] of our counselors to all of our uh
[25:46] workers who work tirelessly behind the
[25:48] scenes who all today have that end of
[25:51] Camp stare when you look them in the eye
[25:53] they have that end of Camp stare and uh
[25:56] don't don't chain too many words
[25:58] together in a sentence they won't catch
[26:00] it so talk slow because they're pretty
[26:03] tired amen and we're just asking the
[26:05] Lord to uh rejuvenate them and you know
[26:10] we we certainly have appreciated the
[26:12] ministry my goodness what quality
[26:15] Ministry my
[26:21] my my
[26:23] goodness I I had such a hard time being
[26:26] behaving myself I have a a situation
[26:29] where I you know probably 12 I don't
[26:33] remember how many weeks or months ago uh
[26:35] the devil attacked me with shingles it
[26:37] went in my eye I've had a second run of
[26:39] it so I'm under doctor's orders to not
[26:41] get too excited and I'm easily excited
[26:44] so it's been difficult and um and after
[26:48] Friday night's service and I helped
[26:50] brother Andrew preach uh I was really uh
[26:54] you know in all the prayer line and the
[26:56] the what you put out for that it my eye
[26:58] was swelling up and I could feel it so I
[27:01] I told Brother Andrew I hate to have to
[27:02] sit on you on Friday night but I'll
[27:05] raise my hand and I'll say Amen but then
[27:08] uh last night with brother Josh he
[27:11] pulled me up out of my seat I couldn't
[27:13] stay seated so I just had to run and
[27:16] chase him down silently amen but uh so I
[27:20] apologize for that if it looked like I
[27:21] was inconsistent believe me I was
[27:23] enjoying it all and like my dad said I I
[27:26] would I would have liked to rose up
[27:28] blowed through the roof and landed in
[27:29] the lake but that was how I felt but I I
[27:33] couldn't do that but I appreciate the
[27:35] Lord coming I think our prayer line last
[27:37] night you know all that is friends if if
[27:40] anybody you know ask a question about
[27:42] that all we're doing is carrying on the
[27:45] traditions of William brandham he held
[27:47] prayer meetings he held prayer lines he
[27:51] designated special calendar events he
[27:54] would he would adjust his sermon to meet
[27:57] that because that builds faith that
[27:59] builds an expectation and so we're just
[28:03] continuing what our Prophet did and and
[28:05] I know that you gained a great benefit
[28:08] from it we plan to do that till the Lord
[28:09] comes I think that the the people have a
[28:12] right to call for the Elders of the
[28:13] church to lay hands upon them and pray
[28:17] amen and the way we do it here that's a
[28:19] little bit unique to us that's kind of
[28:21] how we roll that gives you an
[28:23] opportunity to come up and express your
[28:25] heart you're not just run through quick
[28:27] I'm have no problem with those kinds of
[28:29] Gauntlet prayer lines my dad went
[28:31] through one of those with brother
[28:33] brandham and my dad wanted the
[28:35] discernment line and when brother
[28:36] brandham said we can't do that and and
[28:39] we're just going to have to line up some
[28:40] preachers here and make a gauntlet and
[28:42] run the people through and just quickly
[28:43] lay your hands on him and uh my dad my
[28:46] dad said he said I said no Lord that's
[28:50] not what I
[28:51] wanted and so but then he said man he
[28:54] said when that prayer line started they
[28:56] were they were taking them through and
[28:57] brother Brandon was right in the middle
[28:59] and and as my dad came through brother
[29:01] Brandon wasn't stopping anybody just
[29:03] Lord bless him in Jesus name in Jesus
[29:05] name and he said my dad got right in
[29:06] front of him he stopped and grabbed my
[29:08] dad by the arm and pulled him in close
[29:10] and he stuck his finger in his face and
[29:12] he said you believe don't you son my dad
[29:14] said yes sir amen seven hours away I was
[29:18] healed instantly of an incurable blood
[29:20] disease God still
[29:23] moves
[29:26] amen
[29:30] and I I firmly I firmly uh and that's
[29:33] another thing is my voice I don't know
[29:35] what happened so it just maybe the Lord
[29:37] did that to keep me from damaging my I
[29:40] don't know this it's up to God I don't
[29:42] it's I don't keep up with it just
[29:44] whatever the Lord wants amen but um you
[29:47] know I I I know that the Lord was
[29:49] helping you last night in your needs
[29:53] amen I'm going to get out of the way
[29:54] because if I stay here too long I'll
[29:56] open a text and start preaching but I'm
[29:59] looking forward to uh the the
[30:01] continuation from Brother Josh last
[30:03] night I so enjoyed that amen made so
[30:06] many notes and took so many notes I
[30:08] didn't take a single note of brother

[1:08:35] prophets who through faith subdued
[1:08:38] kingdoms wrot righteousness obtained
[1:08:41] promises stopped the mouth of lions
[1:08:44] quenched the violence of fire escaped
[1:08:46] the edge of the sword and out of
[1:08:49] weakness were made strong wax valent in
[1:08:52] F in fight turned to flight the armies
[1:08:55] of the aliens women received their dead
[1:08:58] raised to life again and others were
[1:09:01] tortured not accepting Deliverance that
[1:09:04] they might obtain a better resurrection

[1:09:27] whom the world was not worthy they
[1:09:30] wandered in deserts and in mountains and
[1:09:32] inds and the caves of the earth and all
[1:09:35] these having obtained a good report
[1:09:38] through faith receive not the promise
[1:09:42] God having provided some better thing
[1:09:44] for us that they without us should not
[1:09:48] be made
[1:09:50] perfect chapter 12 verse 1 wherefore for
[1:09:53] seeeing we also are compassed about with
[1:09:56] so great a cloud of
[1:09:58] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:10:02] and and the sin which does so easily
[1:10:04] beset us and let us run with patience
[1:10:08] the race that is set before us looking
[1:10:11] unto Jesus the author and the finisher
[1:10:13] of our faith who for the joy that was
[1:10:16] set before him endured the cross
[1:10:18] despising the shame and is set down at
[1:10:21] the right hand of the Throne of God God
[1:10:25] 1 Corinthians chapter 9 and I'd like to
[1:10:28] read from the 24th
[1:10:30] verse First Corinthians
[1:10:36] 9 Paul says know ye not that they which
[1:10:40] run in a race run all but one receiveth
[1:10:43] the prize so run that you may
[1:10:47] obtain and every man that striveth for
[1:10:50] the Mastery is tempered in all things
[1:10:53] now they do it to obtain a corruptible
[1:10:55] Crown but we an
[1:10:58] Incorruptible I therefore so run not as
[1:11:02] uncertainly so fight I not as one that
[1:11:05] beateth the air but I keep under my body
[1:11:09] and bring it into subjection least that
[1:11:11] by any means when I have preached to
[1:11:14] others I myself should be a Cast Away
[1:11:18] amen I'd like to speak to you this
[1:11:19] morning on let us run amen you can have
[1:11:22] your seats
[1:11:30] you can see here in the scripture that
[1:11:33] Paul is is using the example of a race I
[1:11:38] believe that Paul in that time you know
[1:11:40] the Greeks especially they were well
[1:11:42] known for being very competitive and
[1:11:44] their and they had a lot of games and
[1:11:47] races and things of that nature I figure
[1:11:49] uh that most of you would understand
[1:11:51] those things and and uh
[1:11:54] there's been a lot of uh uh you know the
[1:11:57] games played here even and things that
[1:11:59] you've done and and and you know they
[1:12:02] Paul is is using that as an example uh
[1:12:06] and he's he's actually using a race that
[1:12:09] that would be run as an example of our
[1:12:12] Christian Life and and and so we know
[1:12:15] that uh in this race that Paul is
[1:12:18] speaking of here it's not it's not
[1:12:19] necessarily a race of speed but it's a
[1:12:22] race of endurance
[1:12:24] because we know that he said let us run
[1:12:27] this race with patience so so it's not
[1:12:30] talking about necessarily who who's
[1:12:32] going to you know a a race of of of of
[1:12:34] speed but it's a race of endurance and I
[1:12:38] believe that the Bible says that or
[1:12:40] Jesus would say there in the scripture
[1:12:42] that you'll be hated of of all men for
[1:12:45] my name's sake but he that endureth to
[1:12:47] the end shall be saved see it's not it's
[1:12:50] not the one that starts the race it's
[1:12:52] it's the one that finishes he that
[1:12:55] endureth to the end shall be saved amen
[1:12:58] so you know I believe that uh uh we've
[1:13:00] got to endure now Paul was giving us
[1:13:03] these examples we know in the book of
[1:13:05] Hebrews there in the 11th chapter that's
[1:13:07] the that's the uh the heroes of the
[1:13:09] faith and and God put these things in
[1:13:12] the scripture to give us examples that
[1:13:14] we could look into the word of God how
[1:13:16] many believes the word of God is a
[1:13:18] mirror and then and and and the prophet
[1:13:20] said that we got to look in the word and
[1:13:21] we got to find something in in the
[1:13:24] scripture we got to find somebody in the
[1:13:26] scripture that we identify ourselves
[1:13:28] amen with that with that Bible character
[1:13:31] there amen because we know that if we
[1:13:33] can do that then we can see that if they
[1:13:36] were able to overcome amen then we also
[1:13:39] will overcome is that right so we God
[1:13:42] God placed these things in the scripture
[1:13:44] and Paul was writing of the great Heroes
[1:13:46] of the faith and then he continues on
[1:13:49] there in Hebrews 12 and says now being
[1:13:51] that we're so compassed about with such
[1:13:53] a great cloud of witnesses let us run
[1:13:56] let us run this race with patience
[1:13:59] that's been set before us and then he
[1:14:01] gives us a a uh you know instruction
[1:14:04] that wh while we're running this race we
[1:14:07] got to keep our eyes on one thing and
[1:14:09] one thing alone amen looking unto Jesus
[1:14:13] amen who is the author and the finisher
[1:14:15] of our faith amen look as we look at
[1:14:18] this amen Paul said we got to lay aside
[1:14:21] every weight amen we got to lay aside
[1:14:24] every sin that so easily besets us now
[1:14:27] the prophet would say grieve not the
[1:14:28] holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed
[1:14:31] amen he said until the next Revival no
[1:14:34] no until the day of redemption is that
[1:14:37] right amen there's no ups and downs and
[1:14:39] ins and out when you really get into God
[1:14:41] if you're really in him not just
[1:14:44] impersonating something but when you're
[1:14:46] really in Christ you you you've got one
[1:14:49] alternative your whole heart is sold out
[1:14:52] every bridge is burnt behind you and you
[1:14:54] got your affection set on the things
[1:14:56] which are above and you run the race
[1:14:59] with patience that's set before you is
[1:15:02] that right amen watch as he goes on in
[1:15:05] another place this is in the word made
[1:15:06] flesh there uh uh he says they had their
[1:15:09] opportunity they had their opportunity
[1:15:12] he's talking about amen those who went
[1:15:14] before it they had their opportunity he

[1:16:12] bundle full of the love of God poured

[1:16:49] the matter with people today they're

[1:16:57] to be a
[1:16:58] Christian listen the journey that we're
[1:17:00] going on we're not packing for it we're

[1:20:06] you had a pinstriped suit it wouldn't
[1:20:07] have but one
[1:20:11] stripe but I also learned that you never
[1:20:15] quote Homer
[1:20:17] Longoria only he can say the things that
[1:20:20] he
[1:20:21] says but the problem said he said I'm
[1:20:24] laying aside every weight that so easily
[1:20:27] besets me I've got to run this race he

[1:20:53] said that's it just separate yourself
[1:20:55] from everything I'll have to say this
[1:20:58] look I hope it finds a resting place cuz
[1:21:00] I never thought it premeditated maybe
[1:21:03] that's the reason some of us are not
[1:21:05] getting along so well we're holding on
[1:21:07] to things that we ought to let go see
[1:21:09] it's separation see we're holding on to
[1:21:11] a little doubt or a little Wonder or a
[1:21:14] little skeptic or I wonder if it's right
[1:21:16] or could this be or could that be or how
[1:21:19] could it be he said Cut Loose this
[1:21:21] morning Hebrews 12 said lay us out every
[1:21:25] weight and sin that so easily besets the
[1:21:28] see amen what is sin sin is unbelief
[1:21:30] amen that does so easily but said and
[1:21:32] let us
[1:21:34] run Hallelujah the raceist set looking
[1:21:37] to Christ who is the author and the
[1:21:39] finisher of our
[1:21:41] faith brother Bram said there's an old
[1:21:44] proverb that's more than a proverb he
[1:21:45] said no matter H how or who is there
[1:21:49] first you have to play the rules of of
[1:21:52] the game or you'll never win if a runner
[1:21:56] is running around the track and one
[1:21:58] takes a
[1:21:59] shortcut and cuts through the field and
[1:22:01] beats the other uh by a half hour he'll
[1:22:05] still he will be
[1:22:07] disqualified see he'll be disqualified
[1:22:09] at the end of the race he's got to play
[1:22:12] it according to the rules of the game or
[1:22:14] he's disqualified and that's the way we
[1:22:17] have to do the race of life we're
[1:22:18] running now it's got to be played
[1:22:20] according to God's qualifications
[1:22:23] or we're going to lose when we get there
[1:22:24] see whether we be present or whether
[1:22:27] amen we be I'm sorry whether we be a
[1:22:29] president or a governor or minister or
[1:22:32] what church we belong to or what
[1:22:34] denomination the rules of the game has
[1:22:36] to be kept we must run it fair we must
[1:22:39] run it by the rules we must preach the
[1:22:41] word we must doing do it willingly and
[1:22:44] Paul said I believe there in Hebrews 12
[1:22:46] that seeing we're so compassed about
[1:22:48] with such a great cloud of witness let
[1:22:50] us lay aside every weight and seeing
[1:22:52] that so easily beset us that we might
[1:22:54] run with patience the race that is set
[1:22:56] before us Paul is speaking of the
[1:22:59] Olympics and so forth amen that was in
[1:23:01] Greece and in Rome and so he know amen
[1:23:03] that they had to play the game fair for
[1:23:06] if you did not you'd be disqualified and
[1:23:08] let me just say this tonight amen it's
[1:23:10] the same thing with you there ain't no
[1:23:14] shortcuts there ain't no
[1:23:16] bypasses amen there's only one way
[1:23:19] listen friend I believe with all my I
[1:23:21] know it ain't popular preaching more but
[1:23:23] I still believe there ain't but one way
[1:23:25] to get to heaven there's only one Lord
[1:23:27] One Faith one baptism one God above us
[1:23:30] all working in us all and there is no
[1:23:35] shortcuts hallelujah amen and if you get
[1:23:38] there and you come any other way but by
[1:23:40] the door amen then you'll be cast out is
[1:23:44] that right amen God put it in the
[1:23:46] scripture when a man climbed up and got
[1:23:49] in there some other way but he didn't
[1:23:52] have on on the right garment what did
[1:23:53] they do they took him and bound him hand
[1:23:55] and foot and cast him out he was
[1:24:00] disqualified because he didn't come
[1:24:02] God's provided
[1:24:03] way there's no shortcuts
[1:24:08] friends he
[1:24:12] says he
[1:24:14] says right uh before that previous to
[1:24:17] that he gave the great 11th chapter of
[1:24:20] Hebrews which gives a Heroes of the
[1:24:23] Faith by faith Moses by faith Abraham by
[1:24:25] faith Enoch by faith Noah all the great
[1:24:28] Heroes of the faith in saying seeing
[1:24:31] that we're so compassed about with such
[1:24:32] a great cloud of witness let us lay
[1:24:35] aside every
[1:24:37] weight man here we are tonight right in
[1:24:40] the shadows of the coming of the Son of
[1:24:43] God and yet we find the church in an
[1:24:46] anemic condition we ought to be a great
[1:24:49] strong Mighty Warriors of the faith that
[1:24:52] would shake a nation God give it to us
[1:24:56] we would just receive it see amen so
[1:24:58] there's so there's little things upon us
[1:25:01] that's holding us back from running but
[1:25:04] let us lay aside all those little
[1:25:06] weights now because we're looking to the
[1:25:08] author and the finisher of our faith
[1:25:10] which is Jesus Christ who who made man
[1:25:13] on the earth amen and dwelt among was
[1:25:15] made man rather and dwelt Among Us and
[1:25:17] was made sin that through his
[1:25:19] righteousness we might be forgiven of
[1:25:22] our sins and he become us sinners that
[1:25:24] we might become his righteousness and
[1:25:26] otherwise like this he became me that I
[1:25:29] might become him he was the son of God I
[1:25:32] was a sinner but he took my place amen
[1:25:36] that I might take his
[1:25:37] place hallelujah amen why did he do that
[1:25:41] amen that he might give you the ability
[1:25:43] to run this
[1:25:45] [Music]
[1:25:47] race now now watch because brother bman
[1:25:50] the church AG book would
[1:25:52] would show that one of the uh rewards to
[1:25:56] the Overcomer would be a Crown of
[1:25:59] Life and the prophet of God took that
[1:26:02] and he ties it back with 1 Corinthians 9
[1:26:04] which we read and Paul says know you not
[1:26:07] that they which run in a race run all
[1:26:09] but one receiveth the prize so run that
[1:26:12] you might obtain now watch what brother
[1:26:14] Brown said a crown given to a winner of
[1:26:17] an Olympic race was a Garland of olive
[1:26:19] branches but the crown Spoken Here in
[1:26:22] Revelation that's given to a martyr is a
[1:26:24] crown of royalty Jesus calls it the
[1:26:27] Crown of Life the crown amen the the one
[1:26:31] Crown is for those that have striven
[1:26:34] amen the other is for those that have
[1:26:36] given so in other words he's showing the
[1:26:37] reward is the same uh uh the the the
[1:26:40] same reward that's given to a martyr
[1:26:42] that actually give their life for the
[1:26:44] cause of the Gospel is given to a
[1:26:46] Believer who lives their life for the
[1:26:49] cause of the Gospel one has given their
[1:26:51] life one is living their life amen but
[1:26:54] listen friends whether you're striving
[1:26:56] or whether you're you're you're you're
[1:26:57] giving amen it makes no difference and
[1:26:59] by the way the prophet of God said it's
[1:27:01] the same Faith the same faith that was
[1:27:04] in them that give them the ability to
[1:27:06] actually lay down their life for the
[1:27:08] cause of Christ is the same Faith that's
[1:27:11] in you that gives you the ability to
[1:27:13] live your life for the cause of
[1:27:17] Christ and the reward is the same and he
[1:27:21] says it's the Crown of Life now you know
[1:27:23] we're not running for amen because watch
[1:27:26] what the prophet of God said he said he
[1:27:28] said both crowns are Incorruptible they
[1:27:30] will not perish the winners of a uh a
[1:27:34] race out here in the world will uh will
[1:27:36] will soon lose the the the joy of the
[1:27:39] Applause of the world their Glory will
[1:27:42] fail those who have given their lives
[1:27:44] for God either by daily striving for
[1:27:46] shedding their blood for a crown amen of
[1:27:49] of sacrifice amen that they will be
[1:27:52] given a Crown of Life and the crown that
[1:27:54] they are given will never will never
[1:27:57] diminish listen friends we're not
[1:27:59] running this race amen for the Applause
[1:28:01] of men we're not running to be
[1:28:04] recognized or or that our name would be
[1:28:06] great upon the Earth We're not running
[1:28:08] Amen to see who could be the greatest
[1:28:10] this is not a competition like that
[1:28:12] we're not running competing against one
[1:28:14] another Amen to see who could be the
[1:28:17] best or who could sing the best or who
[1:28:19] can preach the best amen we're not
[1:28:22] running for that kind of a crown we're
[1:28:24] running for the crown of eternal
[1:28:28] life Hallelujah you're actually running
[1:28:31] for your
[1:28:32] life and your reward is a reward of
[1:28:35] eternal
[1:28:37] life because I want to tell you amen
[1:28:39] listen you can look at look out here at
[1:28:41] Hollywood look out into the sports world

[1:28:52] and they're well known and but
[1:28:55] listen their beauty will fade their
[1:28:58] abilities will
[1:29:00] diminish amen and one day they'll be
[1:29:04] forgotten come on
[1:29:06] friends it's not that kind of race and
[1:29:09] it's not that kind of
[1:29:12] crown watch
[1:29:14] what the Bible says and because iniquity
[1:29:17] shall
[1:29:18] abound the love of
[1:29:20] many shall wax
[1:29:23] cold but he that shall endure to the
[1:29:26] end shall be
[1:29:29] saved Paul speaking to the Galatians the
[1:29:32] galatian church there in Galatians 5 he
[1:29:35] said you did run
[1:29:37] well but what hindered you is that right
[1:29:42] amen you did run in other words you
[1:29:43] started out good but what hindered you
[1:29:46] watch what brother Brown said in the
[1:29:48] message why I'm against organized
[1:29:49] religion he said that's exactly what
[1:29:51] happened to our Pentecostal churches
[1:29:53] they did exactly what their mother did
[1:29:55] at the beginning see they come out of
[1:29:57] people that rejected denominations and
[1:30:00] and some of you Brethren listen to this
[1:30:02] tape but some of you old men you know
[1:30:03] that years ago 40 50 years ago amen if
[1:30:06] they had talked to you about
[1:30:07] organization you You' have said it was
[1:30:09] blasphemy but today you belong to the
[1:30:12] very thing that you thought was
[1:30:13] blasphemy and you women that Bob your
[1:30:16] hair and paint your face your mother was
[1:30:18] against that amen that good old
[1:30:20] Pentecostal Saint what happened to you
[1:30:23] Paul said you did run well what hindered
[1:30:26] you see amen back there amen you was
[1:30:29] free from that stuff but but you wanted
[1:30:31] to be like the rest of them amen and and
[1:30:34] what do we see that things that used to
[1:30:36] be wrong begin to creep back into the
[1:30:38] church and the things that we used to
[1:30:40] stand against begin to creep back into
[1:30:43] the church amen and Paul amen telling
[1:30:45] the glaci of church listen you started
[1:30:47] out good but what happened you did run
[1:30:51] well but what happened what hindered you

[1:31:08] listen God is not looking for somebody
[1:31:10] to start he's looking for somebody to
[1:31:14] finish he that endures to the
[1:31:19] end now the scripture I read last
[1:31:22] night Paul said in Acts 20:24 none of
[1:31:25] these things move me neither I count my
[1:31:28] life dear to myself so that I may finish
[1:31:31] so that I may finish my course with
[1:31:38] joy one great athlete said this the will

[1:31:45] prepare let me tell you something you

[1:34:18] race you actually got to see yourself at
[1:34:21] the Finish
[1:34:25] Line you you got to you got to have a
[1:34:28] vision of the Finish Line before you
[1:34:31] ever start how many knows brother Brown
[1:34:32] talked about a little boy one time and
[1:34:34] he he uh they was having this
[1:34:36] competition and who could ride a bicycle
[1:34:38] across this this bridge and it was just
[1:34:42] a very narrow thing you know and and and
[1:34:45] all these boy and brother Bram said this
[1:34:46] little boy that's what brother
[1:34:47] Bram said he called him a little
[1:34:49] boy he said and and and all the other
[1:34:51] boys boys was making fun of him and all
[1:34:52] this stuff but he was watching them and
[1:34:54] they get up on the plank and they was
[1:34:56] riding their bicycle and and he said and
[1:34:58] they were looking down at the at the
[1:34:59] plank you know and as they were watching
[1:35:01] that they were trying to stay on it he
[1:35:02] said but they would go to tottering and
[1:35:04] and and and you know wavering and am
[1:35:07] because they were looking down they were
[1:35:09] looking right in front of them and they
[1:35:11] were looking at that plank and he said
[1:35:13] and they were all falling off and and
[1:35:15] this little boy he climbed up on
[1:35:18] the bicycle and he began riding that
[1:35:19] bicycle across that plank and he wrote
[1:35:21] it straight to the other side and all
[1:35:23] them other boys come and said man how'd
[1:35:25] you do that he said well I watched y'all
[1:35:27] and I watched what you were doing and I
[1:35:29] watched that you were looking down the
[1:35:30] whole time he said but I just set my
[1:35:32] eyes toward the Finish Line he said and
[1:35:35] I never looked at anything else I just
[1:35:37] looked at the finish line and he rode
[1:35:39] straight across Hallelujah let me tell
[1:35:41] you something if you're looking down
[1:35:43] you're going to go down if you're
[1:35:44] looking around you you're going to
[1:35:46] follow to the left or to the right if
[1:35:48] you're worried about your neighbor amen
[1:35:50] if you're looking at everybody else else
[1:35:52] amen listen you're going to fail but if
[1:35:54] you'll look under Jesus who is the
[1:35:56] author and the finisher of your faith

[1:41:49] bradhurst he hadn't R ran in any races
[1:41:52] for years since his high school days but
[1:41:55] he decided that he was going to run in
[1:41:57] the in the Pepsi challenge
[1:42:02] 10K sent in his application he wasn't
[1:42:04] sure if they'd let him in but they sent
[1:42:07] back he was he entered into the race and
[1:42:11] so he began to prepare himself trained
[1:42:14] and his major reason for wanting to run
[1:42:17] in this race was because there was a a
[1:42:19] man by the name of Bill Rogers that was
[1:42:21] a nationally known Runner and he was
[1:42:22] also competing in that challenge and and
[1:42:26] and and this this gentleman uh Bill
[1:42:29] broadhurst had looked up to him and
[1:42:32] admired him and he wanted to run beside
[1:42:34] him the reason why he hadn't run a race
[1:42:37] in all them years is because when he was
[1:42:39] in the prime of his life he had suffered
[1:42:42] an aneurysm that caused the doctors a
[1:42:43] question if he had ever even
[1:42:47] walk and they they they let let alone
[1:42:52] run but he continually took on the
[1:42:56] impossible and met the challenge and
[1:42:58] eventually he did learn to
[1:43:01] walk but as as he walked he always was
[1:43:05] dragging one foot he could step with one
[1:43:09] and drag the other step with one and
[1:43:12] drag the other and that's the way he
[1:43:15] walked and that's also the way he
[1:43:17] run and so he went and he entered the
[1:43:21] race and when they started the race for
[1:43:24] the first few moments he run with the
[1:43:26] rest of the runners and and for a little
[1:43:28] while he could see them in the distance
[1:43:31] but after a while they went clean out of
[1:43:32] his sight and then after a while he be
[1:43:36] to hear their footsteps as they coming
[1:43:39] back behind him they were actually
[1:43:40] lapping him and they and they run by him
[1:43:43] again and and and so they had finished
[1:43:46] the race and for a little while you know
[1:43:48] some of the people stood along the roads
[1:43:50] as they do and and cheered him on but
[1:43:52] after a while you know they had things
[1:43:53] to do and places to go and people begin
[1:43:55] to disperse and even the police officers
[1:43:58] tried to stay for a while to block the
[1:43:59] traffic and so forth but after a while
[1:44:01] they had to go back to their jobs and
[1:44:03] they removed all the markers and and
[1:44:05] they even said that after a little while
[1:44:06] as he was running down the the the the
[1:44:09] the track or the the road there the
[1:44:11] marathon the path that they had said and
[1:44:13] dragging his leg the children begin to
[1:44:15] come out and make fun of him and taau
[1:44:17] him and and and and and ridicule him and
[1:44:19] but he just kept phone running and
[1:44:21] listen there was nobody around it it got
[1:44:23] to a place that he said that he felt
[1:44:25] like he had become the Forgotten man and
[1:44:27] there was nobody there to witness this
[1:44:29] achievement there was nobody there to to
[1:44:32] you know uh uh to cheer him on or or or
[1:44:35] anything like that he was just running
[1:44:37] all by himself but with sheer
[1:44:39] determination he said I'm going to
[1:44:40] finish this race don't matter if nobody
[1:44:43] else sees I'm going to finish this race
[1:44:45] and he just kept on running and he got
[1:44:48] close to that finish line and when he
[1:44:49] did what what he didn't know was that
[1:44:52] all the runners that had been a part of
[1:44:54] that race including uh Bill Rogers that
[1:44:57] had actually won the race had had hid
[1:45:00] themselves in the alleys right at the
[1:45:02] finish line and right about the time
[1:45:05] brother Jason that he was getting ready
[1:45:07] to cross that finish line they come
[1:45:09] pouring out of the alleys and they begin
[1:45:11] cheering him amen and they lifted him up
[1:45:15] Amen on their shoulders and carried him
[1:45:17] and Bill Rogers which had won the the
[1:45:19] the race amen took the prize and and put
[1:45:22] it over his neck and he said today
[1:45:24] you're the real winner of this
[1:45:28] race and when I read that story I got to
[1:45:32] thinking about I thought sometimes amen
[1:45:34] we're ridiculed made fun of we feel like
[1:45:37] that we're forgotten and we feel like
[1:45:38] we're all by ourselves amen and we feel
[1:45:40] like we're running all alone but there's
[1:45:43] a great cloud of witnesses and when we
[1:45:45] get to the Finish Line hallelujah amen
[1:45:49] they're going to step over there's going
[1:45:51] to be such a blending of Dimensions that
[1:45:53] they're going to come in and we're going
[1:45:55] to see them and we're going to hear
[1:45:57] their
[1:46:00] cheers Hallelujah whether you know it or
[1:46:03] not this morning amen they are cheering
[1:46:05] for you right now they're saying press
[1:46:07] on run don't stop Hallelujah somebody
[1:46:12] has got to finish it somebody it's got
[1:46:14] to go to
[1:46:19] perfection
[1:46:25] oh
[1:46:27] my there was a
[1:46:30] man several years ago a Chinese
[1:46:35] gentleman they invited him to a the
[1:46:38] Chinese government
[1:46:41] actually put together a ceremony invited
[1:46:44] this gentleman and gave him a great
[1:46:46] honor he was a competitor
[1:46:50] in the 1968 Olympic marathon in Mexico
[1:46:54] and he actually was a last place
[1:46:57] finisher you think why in the world
[1:47:00] would the Chinese government invite a
[1:47:03] 70y old man who finished dead last in
[1:47:06] the Olympics and give him a great
[1:47:09] honor what was because of this is
[1:47:12] because when he started running that
[1:47:17] Marathon there in Mexico in
[1:47:19] 1968
[1:47:22] early on in the journey he stumbled and
[1:47:25] fell and injured himself
[1:47:27] immediately he was out of the Runnings
[1:47:29] he was he was no longer a competitor
[1:47:32] there was no way he was going to finish
[1:47:34] in any position he was not going to
[1:47:36] receive any medals he immediately it was
[1:47:38] as soon as he fell and injured himself
[1:47:40] it was over but he got up and he
[1:47:44] continued
[1:47:46] on and he just kept on and he limped his
[1:47:49] way AC AC cross that finish line and a

[1:49:41] up got a purpose in your
[1:49:44] heart I'm going to just share a couple
[1:49:48] more stories with you just encouragement
[1:49:52] there's a little
[1:49:53] girl her name was
[1:49:55] Wilma she was born
[1:49:58] prematurely this produced complications
[1:50:01] that resulting in her con uh uh she got
[1:50:06] double pneumonia twice scarlet
[1:50:09] fever but the worst was that she had a
[1:50:13] really bad bout with
[1:50:15] polio which left her with a crooked leg
[1:50:19] and a twisted
[1:50:20] foot she had to wear metal metal
[1:50:24] braces she got stars from the
[1:50:26] neighborhood
[1:50:29] kids six years of bus rides to Nashville
[1:50:32] for
[1:50:32] treatments could have driven her
[1:50:35] to could have she could have took that
[1:50:37] and went into a a
[1:50:40] shell she could have you know
[1:50:44] just give into it but she
[1:50:49] refused she was determined not to allow
[1:50:52] her disability to get in the way of her
[1:50:55] dreams maybe maybe her determination was
[1:50:58] generated by uh the faith of her mother
[1:51:01] who often said honey the most important
[1:51:03] thing in life is that for you to believe
[1:51:06] and keep on
[1:51:07] trying by age 11 she decided that
[1:51:12] through sheer
[1:51:14] determination and a spirit to persevere
[1:51:18] regardless of the circumstance she for
[1:51:20] for herself to learn how to walk without
[1:51:22] braces by age 12 she had made a
[1:51:24] wonderful discovery that she could run
[1:51:26] and jump and play ball her older sister
[1:51:29] was quite a good basketball player so
[1:51:31] she decided to challenge her on the
[1:51:32] court she began to improve the two of
[1:51:35] them uh ultimately went out for the same
[1:51:37] school team her sister made the final 12
[1:51:41] but Wilma didn't however because her
[1:51:43] father would allow uh would would allow
[1:51:46] her sister to travel with the team or
[1:51:48] she he wouldn't rather allow her to
[1:51:50] travel alone without her sister uh as a
[1:51:52] chaperon Wilma found herself often in
[1:51:55] the presence of the coach one day she
[1:51:57] built up enough nerve to confront the
[1:52:00] man and she she blurred it out to him
[1:52:03] she said if you'll give me 10 minutes of
[1:52:05] your time every day in only 10 minutes
[1:52:07] I'll give you a world class
[1:52:11] athlete he took her up on
[1:52:13] it shortly
[1:52:16] thereafter I'm I'm sorry um the result
[1:52:19] is
[1:52:20] history she finally won a starting
[1:52:22] position on the basketball squad and

[1:52:28] to try out for the track team what a
[1:52:29] decision in her first race she beat her
[1:52:32] girlfriend then she beat all the girls

[2:02:52] on
[2:02:57] run let me tell you something about a a
[2:03:00] relay a
[2:03:02] relay first of
[2:03:05] all if you're if you had a relay team
[2:03:08] you start out with your with a strong
[2:03:13] Runner and you
[2:03:15] end with a strong
[2:03:17] Runner now now listen that's not to
[2:03:21] diminish or take away from the
[2:03:23] importance of every runner in
[2:03:25] between they had to keep the pace they
[2:03:28] had to stay steady they had to play
[2:03:31] their
[2:03:32] part but a good coach will recognize the
[2:03:36] strengths and he wants to start out with
[2:03:39] the strongest he wants to end with the
[2:03:43] strongest and God started this race the
[2:03:46] same
[2:03:47] way he he started out with the alpha
[2:03:50] Church on the day of Pentecost with the
[2:03:53] power of the Holy Ghost with the
[2:03:55] original word with original Faith
[2:03:59] Hallelujah and he's going to end
[2:04:02] it with a bride the Omega bride restored
[2:04:06] back listen brother when brother BR saw
[2:04:08] the preview of the Bride he said the
[2:04:10] last one looked exactly like the first
[2:04:14] one Hallelujah and he started it out
[2:04:17] with a prophet and ends it with a
[2:04:19] prophet he started out with the
[2:04:21] unadulterated word and he ends it with
[2:04:24] the unadulterated word and you got the
[2:04:27] original Faith with the original Holy
[2:04:29] Ghost with the original
[2:04:39] Power but in that relay listen as they
[2:04:42] would
[2:04:43] run they didn't they didn't wait brother
[2:04:46] Jason and I'm I am closing
[2:04:50] eventually but they didn't they didn't
[2:04:52] you know it wasn't like a guy was
[2:04:54] standing here and and a guy you know
[2:04:56] he's running the the the runner is
[2:04:58] running towards him he didn't just stand
[2:05:00] there and wait till he got there and
[2:05:04] then now he's going to stop and hand the
[2:05:07] Baton to the next man and he's going to
[2:05:10] start no there there would there was
[2:05:13] there would be a
[2:05:17] blending
[2:05:19] because when he's standing here when he
[2:05:22] sees that guy approaching he starts
[2:05:24] running right
[2:05:26] then and he runs until he gets the
[2:05:32] pace until his steps is matching the
[2:05:35] other Runner steps and when they get in
[2:05:37] Perfect Harmony then they pass the
[2:05:40] Baton the other guys finished his race
[2:05:44] let me just tell you amen that those
[2:05:46] that run before us they run it well they
[2:05:48] finished their race but somebody's got

[2:07:59] 1992
[2:08:01] Olympics that seems like a long time ago
[2:08:03] to y'all don't
[2:08:05] it
[2:08:07] but it was in
[2:08:10] Barcelona
[2:08:11] and what happened there was one of the
[2:08:14] most me memorable Moments in Sports
[2:08:17] history because there was a young man
[2:08:20] and he went to these Olympics he was he
[2:08:23] was actually uh um you
[2:08:27] know he was
[2:08:30] um uh he was
[2:08:32] favored to to place and to win a medal
[2:08:36] and he was a great Runner he he had the
[2:08:39] abilities so
[2:08:41] forth as he started that race his name
[2:08:43] was Derek
[2:08:45] Redmond as he started that race he he
[2:08:48] got off to a great start he was running
[2:08:50] race of his life a Finish Line was right
[2:08:52] in sight and suddenly he felt a stab of
[2:08:55] pain in his right
[2:08:57] leg he fell face first to the
[2:09:01] track the race was
[2:09:04] over the race was over for him but he
[2:09:08] struggled to his feet the medical
[2:09:11] team or I'm sorry before the medical
[2:09:13] team could even reach him he had already
[2:09:15] started running he had already started
[2:09:17] moving towards the finish
[2:09:20] line and though every Runner had passed
[2:09:22] him he began hopping forward tears of
[2:09:26] pain running down his face but he was
[2:09:29] determined to finish that race suddenly
[2:09:32] a man come out of the sidelines play the
[2:09:36] security he ran out on the track and he
[2:09:39] reached over and he took that young man
[2:09:41] in his
[2:09:43] arms he put his arms around
[2:09:47] him what they didn't know a lot of them
[2:09:50] was that was his
[2:09:53] daddy he whispered in that boy's ear he
[2:09:56] said

[2:11:14] you we love you Amen in Jesus name
[2:11:42] God bless
[2:11:45] you I um I hardly have the voice for
[2:11:48] this but Matt and I were discussing the
[2:11:51] plan was to have him come up but that
[2:11:55] sermon touched my heart so deeply for
[2:11:57] very personal
[2:11:59] reasons you got a little time for One
[2:12:01] More
[2:12:04] Story I used to run track and field back
[2:12:08] in the day seemed like many moons
[2:12:12] ago and I was a distance
[2:12:15] Runner and I could I my practice I
[2:12:18] sessions was a threemile run that I
[2:12:21] could run in under 16
[2:12:24] minutes and um they didn't have too many
[2:12:28] of those kinds of races in the school
[2:12:30] where I went so I was stuck running 440s
[2:12:33] and 880s and things like that and I ran
[2:12:35] those relays that brother Josh was
[2:12:37] talking
[2:12:38] about and you had to I'm going to tell
[2:12:40] you something about that relay you had
[2:12:41] to trust The Man Behind you because you
[2:12:44] really you really weren't trying to
[2:12:47] watch him you were trusting him and as
[2:12:50] you're reaching back you're you're
[2:12:52] believing you take one glance and then
[2:12:54] you go here he comes and you're trying
[2:12:56] to sink up and you're trusting that he
[2:12:59] ain't going to faint he ain't going to
[2:13:01] fall he's going to get that baton in
[2:13:03] your hand and you're just waiting for it
[2:13:05] I going to tell you something friends we
[2:13:07] got to have that kind of confidence in
[2:13:08] one
[2:13:10] another globally around the world we got
[2:13:13] to have that kind of confidence in one
[2:13:16] another and I remember
[2:13:19] that when I would when I would train I
[2:13:22] had this this habit of not really
[2:13:29] uh not really running to my
[2:13:32] utmost and and and we would be in the
[2:13:35] practice sessions and it affected at at
[2:13:38] time when we would have tournaments and
[2:13:40] everything and it would affect you know
[2:13:42] because uh you know there was just a
[2:13:46] something where I just said wow wow I I
[2:13:48] should have pressed harder I should have
[2:13:50] pressed harder and and and I'd win some
[2:13:53] and I'd lose some and but you know many
[2:13:56] times I I lost a race that I didn't
[2:14:00] win that I could have and I I was a
[2:14:03] better Runner than the person who ran
[2:14:06] across ahead of me but here's one thing
[2:14:08] that I could say I never quit a race I
[2:14:11] never quit one and I and I remember one
[2:14:15] time I came in and we were in our
[2:14:17] practice session and here I come and I
[2:14:20] had this thing where I would just kind
[2:14:23] of Move Along at my regular Pace during
[2:14:25] the during the three mile practice but
[2:14:28] when I'd make the last turn and I could
[2:14:31] see the Finish Line man I would turn on
[2:14:34] the Jets and I would run and it felt
[2:14:37] like like I was floating on air and I
[2:14:41] would just streak ahead of everybody and
[2:14:43] I would be so jubilent when I got across
[2:14:45] Finish Line and I would just say wow
[2:14:47] that was so wonderful and the coach
[2:14:49] would come up behind me and put a boot
[2:14:52] on my rear end and kick me say they used
[2:14:56] they used to do that in school y'all
[2:14:57] don't know nothing y trust me and he
[2:15:01] would literally give me a boom I'd say
[2:15:04] what was that for and he' say where was
[2:15:06] all of that gusto in the in the first
[2:15:09] two and three quarters of that you know
[2:15:11] where where why were you just Lolly
[2:15:14] gagging along if you can cross the
[2:15:16] finish line with that kind of energy
[2:15:18] then you you wasted a you got a lot of
[2:15:21] energy left and you didn't put it out
[2:15:22] there on the
[2:15:25] track and you know that bothered me and
[2:15:28] I went home and I thought about that and
[2:15:30] it bothered me and and we came up to the
[2:15:33] next track meet and I remember it so
[2:15:36] clear it was the it was the last time I
[2:15:38] was in an official School event and I
[2:15:41] wanted to do well and there were large
[2:15:43] crowds and and I and it and it was a
[2:15:45] longdistance run I forget Maybe I don't
[2:15:48] remember maybe seemed like it was a mile
[2:15:50] maybe I don't remember clearly might
[2:15:52] have been 880 yards but it wasn't a
[2:15:56] relay and I just started running and the
[2:15:59] whole pack I just remember watching the
[2:16:01] pack kind of just pull away from me and
[2:16:04] I was okay with that I said it's okay
[2:16:07] and and I I I finished that race and you
[2:16:11] know whoever won first second and third
[2:16:14] and they got Blue Ribbon red ribbon and
[2:16:16] a yellow ribbon or whatever like that
[2:16:18] and I didn't get anything and I want to
[2:16:19] tell you something that
[2:16:22] caused something that happened to me
[2:16:24] that I
[2:16:25] carried for years I still fight against
[2:16:29] it to this day it's a
[2:16:31] complex and the complex is this that I
[2:16:35] always feel like no matter what I'm
[2:16:37] doing no matter how much I do a a I'm
[2:16:41] constantly preaching I'm constantly
[2:16:43] teaching I'm constantly on Bible studies
[2:16:45] I'm traveled the world s six six
[2:16:48] continents out of seven preaching the
[2:16:50] message of the hour 42 different
[2:16:53] countries but I always have this sense
[2:16:55] of I'm underachieving I'm underachieving
[2:16:59] and it causes me to push and push and
[2:17:01] push because I'm underachieving and one
[2:17:03] day I was just talking to the Lord and I
[2:17:06] said Lord I'm so sorry that I'm always
[2:17:09] an
[2:17:10] underachiever and and and I don't know
[2:17:13] why I don't press harder and I I want to
[2:17:15] press it's in me to press where's my
[2:17:17] disciplined depressed is anybody have
[2:17:20] that kind of a
[2:17:21] struggle you say I I I could have should
[2:17:24] have would have why didn't I and I just
[2:17:28] thought to myself and I just it was such
[2:17:29] a burden and not so long ago the Lord
[2:17:33] came to me and I was just crying the
[2:17:35] same old cry the same old prayer boohoo
[2:17:38] over it and and the Lord the Lord just
[2:17:41] said you know you remember that race and
[2:17:44] he took me back all those years to a boy
[2:17:47] and and we and and I thought about all
[2:17:49] the people of all the races that I had
[2:17:52] run and people dropped out and dropped
[2:17:53] out and couldn't finish and couldn't
[2:17:55] finish and the Lord reminded me he said
[2:17:58] you know you did finish that
[2:18:00] race cuz I'd forgot that I had literally
[2:18:05] gotten
[2:18:07] so narrowly minded to my performance
[2:18:12] that I completely forgot I finished the
[2:18:14] race and a lot of people
[2:18:16] didn't and I'm telling you something
[2:18:19] here I am today and I've been raised up
[2:18:23] in this message and I've been running it
[2:18:24] a long time and there have been others
[2:18:27] who were better Runners than me who ran
[2:18:30] ahead of me who have now dropped out and
[2:18:32] went on the sidelines and left the race
[2:18:35] field and went on about their life but
[2:18:37] I'm still running hallelujah hallelujah
[2:18:41] and I'm going to finish
[2:18:43] it I'm not going to quit I'm going to

[2:18:50] fastest but I'm going to finish
