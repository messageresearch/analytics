trumpet blowing back there praise the Lord man glad we were able to uh have that special for our brother happy to have him with us today and other different visitors I see amen got a number of people traveling still on the road amen so uh just want to keep them in prayer but I'm glad you're here and I'm glad the Lord is here amen amen praise the Lord going to invite you right into the scriptures this morning to Second Peter chapter 1 and we hope by the will of the Lord just to continue today and perhaps uh make a little conclusion in this little three-part um series I suppose I would call it um I didn't actually name the series per se but um it's been running a certain theme that we announced and today we hope to come to um the end of Darkness rise of the day star amen so uh we started with end to the darkness and then part two was dark and darker still and then we're moving today to the end of Darkness rise of the day star I trust it's been a blessing to you it sure has been to me my goodness certainly enjoyed it amen God bless you second Peter chapter 1 and um I'm glad to have a comfortable temperature in here amen we um when we disconnect Ed all of our gas lines to pour the slab we didn't connect anything back and then winter jumped in on us so we're running some space heaters today we'll get that back up and running ASAP though amen we're just under a little bit of construction second Peter chapter 1 verse 16 to 21 for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty now I want you to notice right off the bat that Peter joins in that single verse uh as he says the we we made known unto you the power and the coming so there's three things happening one is something gets made known it has to do with his coming and what it is is there's a power asso iated with his coming that is made known man now it's not just made known doctrinally it's made known experientially amen by experience that Peter had actually experienced it verse 17 for he received from God the Father honor and Glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased so again a voice is coming and the voice is coming with a teaching with a Doctrine this is my beloved Son but with but but the voice is accompanied by a demonstration that Peter is writing about it in a rear saying we were there I saw it yeah I saw a light come down we're not just I'm not just telling you what H I'm not just telling you the the teaching that we learned this is my beloved son but there was actually we experienced that teaching in in real time you got you get me all right Verse 18 and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the Holy Mount we have also a more sure word of Prophecy so now so now Peter is saying there was a time back under Isaiah's writings David's writings ezekiel's writings back in Genesis when when the coming of Messiah was foretold job talked about it amen but Peter is saying but now what I'm saying to you is what they had in word only in doctrinal teaching we actually have the experience of that so we have a more sure word than their word because it's been made real To Us by a living experience make sense all right so uh for he re um so um for he received from God the Father honor and Glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased Verse 18 and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him and the holy Mount 19 we have also a more sure word of Prophecy wherein to ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your heart so you're you've got a journey to take until you say what's where's the journey start in the word where does it where does it Con where does it reach its climax when you've had the experience amen and then what happens when you've had the experience you're the living word amen you see what I'm saying all right until so so you keep journeying in the word until the day star arise in your hearts like it did his like it did ours so do you also amen all right so verse 20 knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation so it's not about a doctrinal dispute God interprets his word by bringing it to pass you can't tell me there's no New Birth I've had it you can't tell me there's no power in the Holy Ghost I've experienced it see the day dawned in my heart see and now I living in the same power and victory Peter had who was then living in the same power and victory Jesus had make sense all right all right so knowing this so so it's not about a doctrinal dispute no no none of God's word is up to you to determine what it means god interprets it brother random said it over and over again God does not need anybody to interpret his word see as far as a doctrinal um laying it out doctrinally brother brandham went to the scripture and said God gives his word to His prophets and they give it to the people and it's thus sayith the Lord and when you follow thus sayith the Lord you get the Lord amen amen so you become an extension of the Lord by following thus sayeth the Lord which comes only through a prophet and Le and that word leads you to an experience amen all right knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old times in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost so Peter is simply saying you know these these men of old they didn't come up with what they were going to say on their own so it's so so don't you come up with an interpretation on your own they were moved on by the Holy Spirit you'll have to be moved on by the holy spirit all right let's pray father we thank you for the rapid uh anointing that we feel and the teacher is certainly here today so we thank you for this and now Lord I just relax myself and in your presence humble myself before your presence Lord you be our instructor and teacher today make it real to us Lord these are perilous times that we live in and we we must see your Movement we were invited to see every time a seal is open open the invitation comes from the anointing that beast power come and see so Lord we're here today to see what it is you want us to see I pray that you'll uh give us isav Lord and open up our understanding give us hearing Hearts today to your word to believe every word and to walk forward according to thus sayeth the Lord we commit it to you to you alone in Jesus name amen God bless you as you're seated I love how the Lord Works in such a flow and and you know you're there there's no way to to make sense of all of the word of God outside of the spirit's teaching in you believe that you've got to have it friends we've demonstrated before that while it's true that there are things in God's word in this Bible and of course all of it's true and there are parts of it quite a lot of the parts of it that are accessible to students uh make sure you set up and pay attention don't be dozing or sleeping on me amen amen I'm just not getting started so so so we find that that there are numerous Parts in this book that students comparing verse with verse can decipher it's not difficult brother brandham talking about even the water baptism and he says you don't even need a revelation for water baptism if you can just read see and if you can't read have somebody read it to you it's comp apprehendable in a human just in a human sense without any divine intervention either you read it and you believe it and you emulate it or you won't see and and so on that day there there won't be anyone who can stand and say well I didn't follow it because I didn't understand it the Bible said there is not another name given under Heaven whereby men can be saved other than in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so when you're B so this is why brother brandham on the authority of that could say if you if you've not been baptized in that name if you've been baptized in those titles you need to come and be re-baptized you understand so this is what the Holy Spirit does he leads people and guides people to all truth and and this why we brother Brandon would say there is no salvation in any other name because that's the scripture so you can't you can't get your way there uh using titles man you know that man has what man did is he went down into the ages and he started interpreting the scripture without the Holy Ghost without the spirit and that caused every denomination we have because it's it's it's students of the scripture comparing verse with verse you say well you know that should be a good system well if it's a good system then why do I have north of 33,000 different denominational interpretations of the Gospel there's only one the gospel that's see and I want the gospel I don't want another version of The Gospel you know and and this is what Paul feared Paul feared that that people would follow with Jesus that he had not preached because Christ is the gospel that's the message that's the good news see and so we realize then that that the the idea of using students comparing verse with verse Works to a degree you can understand water baptism you can understand how that husbands ought to love their wives Paul Paul gives you very clear unambiguous instructions do it like Christ did it's pretty easy I can read the life of Jesus I can I know what he's done for me I can treat my wife like he treats me that's not hard to figure out I can read in the Bible that I you know how how you know the different offices work and what they're called and how they operate I can understand how not to not to provoke my children and and I can understand you know all kinds of various things about the word of God I can understand that you know the the the the principles certain certain principles of marriage and divorce I can understand how churches ought to operate but but then there's a a part of the scripture and when I say parts of the scripture there is there are Parts all through it that are open to human understanding here's a part there's a part there's another part there's another part and you can get a whole bucket full of Parts but but we find that from the first page of Genesis to the last page of Revelation there is an overarching revelation of Christ and and and Christ working in a Plan of Redemption and that that's the part that is sealed away from students comparing verse with verse they might can put together some of the mechanics of it they can understand about Jesus of Nazareth and they can understand about how to believe on him and they can understand you know you you'd think they'd understand how to baptize they largely get it wrong and so if they get something that easy so wrong at such scale then why would we trust man-made Theory to interpret a book that's locked out to students and can only be revealed by the spirit of God that's why it's called a mystery of redemption amen the only one that can reveal to you the mystery of redemption According To Jesus is the holy spirit he's the only one who can unlock it to you you can read the you can read chapter and verse and you know there are certain minations who Pride themselves we We've ran into it here locally well they Pride themselves in being able to say chapter and verse they can tell you the chapter and the verse and quote you the verse and they can go to another chapter and verse and if you make a statement they'll say chapter and verse now they don't like having that said to them because I've did it I flipped it back before and you know I you know I got challenged you know chapter and verse where what's this nonsense about Cain being the son of the serpent chapter and verse and so I did we took a whole meeting with them and I showed them chapter and verse and then they their man got up and said it's obvious that Cain uh that that Abel it's obvious that Abel got his understanding of the lamb from his father Adam to which I then said chapter and verse where's that in the Bible and why was why is God Prejudice and gave it abble not Cain why why is Adam I mean to say why would Adam be favoring one son over another son the whole thing is nonsense and so you you find that it takes the spirit's re revealing to reveal to you not just the letter not just the mechanic of the of the correct teaching even if you have the correct teaching brother Brandon went on to say Satan doesn't care how religious you are see so a lot of times I care whether you're in church or not Satan don't really care you can be here or not he doesn't care you could be here every service he doesn't care that's not that doesn't worry him worries me if you're not here doesn't worry the devil and and and he said Satan doesn't even care how right you are in your Doctrine so even if you have all of the letter of the doctrine correct you have have not troubled there's still nothing about you that worries the devil you understand you come to church you have the correct understanding he's still not afraid of you in the slightest he doesn't lose any sleep over you but what he fears is that the holy spirit will make it real to you and you'll get a new birth and you'll come to a new understanding by experiencing the word of God now he's afraid of you see he wasn't it it it it wasn't about why did he fear Paul but he didn't fear the seven sons of ska because they both had a correct understanding but one had an experiential experience and had power moving with that and the others didn't the others went to church the others knew the word they knew the promises in the word of God they had heard Paul's lessons they were they were good message boys but they had not had an experience of the power of of the Holy Spirit and the devil knew that see Paul I know Jesus I know I don't really know much about you you haven't done very much I've seen you in church I've seen you taking notes I've seen you quoting verses but I still haven't seen that thing I'm afraid of what is it you're afraid of Lucifer I I fear that light I'm always afraid of that light if I don't see that light in you if the day star isn't shining in your heart you don't worry me but if you have the day star shining in your heart me and my demons howl and faint when you walk down the street glory to God you see what I'm saying so so we find then that it takes the Holy Spirit and we showed last time how we were finishing out that all of this began at Calvary from the uh you know from the Creator's view as as as I was saying last time as we were closing out God had went 4,000 years and every man he ever put his hand on failed him in some way from Adam all the way through to the end of the Old Testament even his great warriors of the faith that Paul would place in the Hall of Fame and he would he would place the great warriors of of Abraham and Moses and all the judges and and he would and and when we talk about David we talk about the brave men and brave sisters and and the great exploits that they did but we realize then that that finally by the time he gets down to the era that Jesus came forth on the earth God uh from the from the view of of God he was saying enough was enough and I'm not I'm not going to keep going with this substitute system because this substitute system yes I've got children yes they had the seed Gene of God but I and I could come down upon them and I could anoint them and when I came it down upon Moses they even had to Veil his face and as soon as I left the veil came off and he went just back to a man again and I'm not I don't want to do it that way anymore I don't want to just have a have somebody under my anointing when I anoint them and then when I leave they go back I'm done with that system I I can't redeem my family no matter how good of people they are yes I was quite proud of job and job passed the test but I couldn't redeem it in job Abraham was the father of Faith but I couldn't redeem it in Abraham David was a man after my own heart the apple of my eye but I couldn't redeem Israel uh under David it would have to come one to where God would come down himself and not put his hand on a man but become the man and God himself would Tabernacle himself in flesh and offer his own life as an atonement for his family and now that would make the way what did Calvary finish it calvary finished the purchase Jesus said it's finished the purchase is paid the blood of the Lamb has been paid but now is he finished no did the Rapture come of the Old Testament it did but what about all the New Testament what about you and me Calvary made a way for God to come down and say now enough is enough I'm going to live inside of people I'm going to come inside of I'm going to annihilate their nature and I won't be be there on Sundays and Wednesdays I'll be in there every day when they wake up in the morning when they move through the city when they're at Walmart when they're in the car when they're on the job when they're at church I will be with them and in them and I will abide in them forever they in fact will be a continuation of my Ministry it'll be me multiply yes amen so so this was going to go beyond Israel just as a nation of his servants God was expanding to the next phase of his plan from Genesis as I said to you at the end of last time God was going global yeah amen he wasn't even any longer just going to deal with Israel One Nation dropped down in the midst of all Heathen Nations to be a Shining Light and example to try to teach them the ways of the true God it it it was it was miserably failing brother bam talks about how that when Jesus came on the scene when when you know when when you've got blind Anna walking through the temple when you've got Mary bringing in the babe for you know his dedication when you've got uh Zacharias and and and you've got all these different ones and God is uh talking to the father of John and he's bringing John and all God is just doing all of these different things a whole bunch of stuff is happening simultaneously and brother Brandon makes the point how that by the time he comes to do this really even Israel as a nation had pretty much lost all hope of Messiah amen there were just a very few that really were still longing to see the real thing I'm here to tell you something friends that's the condition of the world today even among Christianity all they have is program and they keep adding to their program they keep trying to recycle it reinvent themselves and let's build a bigger building let's do it different let's have this program let's have that program but but the the thought that actually God could come down and live inside of a of a person and literally be the re Reincarnation of Christ moving in the earth and they seem to have lost all hope for that and so they they cast in their lot with a political movement or or this kind of movement or social uh issue I'm here to tell you God was done with that and the bride is done with that and we're looking for the Living God to have living manifestation and it's not too late it's happening now and it's only going to get more and the bride is leaving here we believe that friends we have not followed cunningly devised Tales we have a more sure word of Prophecy John went into the aisle of patmas and wrote about what was coming in our day I can say to John you can say to St John I have a more sure word of Prophecy than you amen saying well I don't know if I have enough courage I don't care whether you have enough courage or not it's true you are now the living experience of what John wrote in the Book of Revelation that nobody clearly understood they didn't understand what it meant when when the age in because if you looked at the leoan church age it ended miserably Christ is put on the outside he's no longer even in the church they're they're blind they're miserable they're poor they're naked they don't even know it they had insult to injury they kick Christ out of the church completely but John saw that in Revelation 4 and in Revelation 5 there was still one seated on the throne and there was one calling for somebody to take the book and loose the seals and redeem the family and we have a more sure word of Prophecy than that today because that book has been open and the seals have been released and I have been brought into the family of God in an age of impossible Darkness impossible sometimes we lose sight of how dark it is brother brandham called it I had never heard this term before brother brandham says in the Great Shining Light we are determined by God's grace to preach the gospel and reflect his light until he comes now Lord the rest is to you we shall Now call these people he's going to get ready to do a prayer line This is 1957 and may the Holy Ghost come to this little Tabernacle and make a faith in every heart oh I pray that is happening today May the Holy Ghost come to this little Tabernacle and make a faith in every heart as they stand come by here to be prayed for may they leave today and do like those wise men when they seen the star again after the spell of darkness is it interesting I I I I paused and I said to my wife I said I've never heard brother Brandon so identify the age that we live in and he calls it a spell of Darkness it's a fair question to to to ask how how has and how does if you can figure out how he does it you can figure out how he's done it how does Satan multiply darkness in the Earth because fallen angels have not multiplied they haven't multiplied you understand so how does he multiply Darkness on the earth when fallen angels have not multiplied how does how does Darkness to continue to permeate and grow throughout and and and until it till we've reached an age where it's now influence the whole world yes and it has them under a complete deception and they're blind and miserable they're miserable poor and naked they're wretched but the blindness brother brandham said is the most most saddest part it's the saddest part because they don't they are all of those things but they don't they don't see that and in fact is they see just the opposite they say no what are you talking about poor I'm rich yeah I'm increased with Goods I'm wretched I'm naked I have need of nothing who are you talking to not me see and so but what they don't realize is is there's a darkness and Isaiah prophesied at the end time that this darkness which we've been talking about came up out of Genesis when all the way to the flood remember we've been preaching on it then it went from Noah and by the time it got to Jesus it had covered the Earth again till even till it was so dark by the time Jesus ministry is on the scene that they do the unthinkable brother brandham said they the most holy people they the most holy city They Crucified the most horrible death the Son of God the most blessed person there they crucified him there in Jerusalem the most holy city they God's chosen people crucified the most horrible death to he the most beautiful person who had ever lived in the Earth how did it get to that point and I'm here to tell you that that that repeats at the end time and that's why a prophet would say I indict this generation for the second crucifixion because now it's not just Jerusalem and Israel doing it it's the whole world the entire Christianity the entire Christian world all 33,000 of them by rejecting Christ the word have crucified a friend so I don't I shouldn't have to spend a lot of time con you know convincing you that darkness is even greater now than when it was in the days of Jesus when there they crucified him now it's Global God went Global why did it Go Global because it was going to be a global bride whose names were in the Lamb's Book of Life and he would take 2,000 years years he would take 20 centuries to fill up the role of all of those names in the Lamb's Book of Life That's why every age has had a message and a messenger that's why your age had a messenger and its message that's why you are believers you are the message made life made flesh made real it's not just Doctrine it's a life Satan's not afraid of Doctrine he's afraid of life so we find then that that's why Isaiah would say concerning the end time now you can see that because it's Isaiah 60 and it's a rise Shine for thy light is come and Gentiles will come to the brightness of thy Rising so clearly an end time prophecy and and Isaiah is saying that by the time you get to this point where you have a light shining in darkness till the day Dawn and the day start our rise so now we're not just talking about individual now we're talking about global there would come a day when it would be Darkness over the whole earth here it is I can't say it simpler than this it would get down to the end time and it wouldn't just be Darkness but it would be gross Darkness on the people it wouldn't just be Israel killing Christ it would be the whole world crucifying the word it would be a time unique from every other age when it would be grow Darkness on the people to where they would think that they're rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing when they actually have nothing amen imagine thinking you have need of nothing when you have nothing and that's that's the level of deception that we are living in and and now we're speaking on now we're speaking to the age now there's prophesied a day star would rise again Isaiah said Isaiah's language was that arise Shine the th light shall come that's why a prophet could come to the pull pit only after the opening of the seals and he could say it is the rising of the Sun and we have come to that Rising the day star has dawned in our age so it's brought an end of Darkness to the world no the world is darker than it's ever been but it brought an end of Darkness to the when God was filling up the role of all of those names in the Lamb's Book of Life I'm here to tell you something for uh friends the Bible says you shall come forth shining in his strength you'll be the light of the world shining in the strength of Christ himself this I'm G to tell you when God was done God was done uh there at Calvary he was he was he was finished with that system and the bride at the last day the spirit and the bride say come because why she is also done with man-made Theory and she's done with man-made ideology she's done with being hemmed in and trapped and boxed in and she can't have the power of God nonsense I'm done with that we have the power of God moving in our homes moving in our lives it's not just dry word it's the spirit that gives life so the Bible then so then it comes back to our question how does Satan multiply how has he been so successful and in fact is he has been more successful since Jesus died at Calvary he has been more successful since the seven sealed book was opened when When Jesus ascended on high and sent his life back into the church that didn't convert the world the world got darker still yes and it that it would get so it would it would get so dark after the upper room experience that even history theologians even brother brandham would call it the Dark Ages amen so and Isaiah would say it'll be dark and then it'll get finally get gross Darkness on the whole people so we realize then that how has this happened you would think that that that since the seals were open the world would start to turn around no sir the the gospel and I've said this before I want to say it again the gospel did not come to save the world the gospel is freely offered to anyone in the world but the same Jesus that sent his disciples out with the gospel prophesied in Matthew 24 in other places that it wouldn't be received it would get darker and worse and worse and the whole world would go into complete apostasy so it's not like Jesus is standing here today saying man I thought I had a locktite plan I can't believe it's got to this boy I just knew if I came down and lived out my life and gave my blood and then I sent back my life into the church and my goodness if they if if just the shadow of Peter could heal people and and and if they could have the power of God and and even that put him in prison and an angel would get him out and open the doors and drop the shackles it it doesn't doesn't matter what I've done and and and and and and you'd think that the whole world would have been converted not only is that not true but it's actually uh gotten worse amen but I'm here to tell you the Lord Jesus isn't standing here ringing his hands saying I don't know I'm it's so bad now I maybe I've waited too long maybe I should have I should have went ahead and had the Rapture years ago because now the world is darkness and gross Darkness over the whole people and the whole world now the scripture says their tables are filled with vomit yeah and and now you've got the days of of Noah and the days of lot like a double barrel shotgun and we're having to live under that now you've got a day when Satan himself has been elected by the popular vote as the god of the evil age and it's on both sides of the aisle right amen now he's the God of this evil age now he's had 6,000 years God is God might be saying gee I took 6,000 years to build my Eden and he broke it I I probably shouldn't have given him 6,000 years because now he's built his Eden now it's it's a Darkness at a scale unprecedented it's Darkness at a scale unequaled unparalleled I may have waited too long it's now too evil if I couldn't get my bride out then how am I going to get her out now don't worry Hallelujah don't worry because arise shine thy light has come and we as kings and the sons of a king king's sons and daughters have come to the brightness of that rising and how do I know that I found the true anointing because the life of this lives inside me and the same love I I I I I find that when I go through his word It's Made Real to me and I even the parts that take my hide off and tell me I need to change this and I need to change that and the world would say you're crazy you should be you do you be be who you want to be I say I I don't want to be me I I'm tired of being me I want to be him Hallelujah friends he has filled the role so and Angels haven't multiplied and yet the Bible describes the world as getting progressively darker yeah until it becomes gross darkness and Satan you know here here's something to understand and and this is this this this Bears out in sociology culture is derived over a three to five generation it's anywhere from 60 to 150 years and you can have a certain culture that's Global but sociology teaches us that that if if you have a a change agent a movement starts and that movement at first it's repudiated at first it's like no that ain't how we do things no you're you're deceiver you're you're that's not that's not accurate and and then and then by the second generation it's like well okay you know you be you will be us and then by the third generation people are starting to go you know maybe hey maybe we should look at this again let's this not all be you know think we're always right maybe there's something to this and then by the time you get to the fourth generation it's a totally accepted Norm amen we can see that in the in the AG of today oh yeah you you can see say oh well but there's been a a big repudiation you know we we elected our Superman we we're repudiating all of that woke nonsense don't think you've cured the world don't think you've even cured this nation I'm here to tell you this nation and the entire world are still steeped in darkness on both sides of the aisle and none of them are willing to accept the Judgment from Heaven none of them are willing to accept that voice they're all they're they're are all failing to catch the voice in the East Wind and the and and and enormous and horrible judgments are rushing to meet us and I'm here to tell you the only way out is up and and that's what happened to the bride at the end of leoda at the end of the last Church age the church goes into the tribulation and the bride goes into Rapture so you you have this you know you and now history is replete with that with many examples I mean for years you know you you they they taught well you know the World is Flat and they had scientists who thought that and then and then and then they had scientists who taught here's another one they taught that the Earth was the center of the universe and then the church got on and then political and religious joined together and then if you said the Earth wasn't the center they would put you to death now that worked for hundreds of years now that didn't you know what done that generational now how did we get that change you had men like cernus men like Galileo and they started coming up looking through their telescopes going uh guys we got a problem and they started saying you know we may not actually be the center of the universe looks like it's bigger than we thought it was and when they first started to do that I mean Galileo was almost killed for that he actually had to kind of repent and write out a little fake apology to the pope you know and and yeah and so and so but finally then by the Next Generation and then you you know you've got the reformation and you then you're going to have the Renaissance and then you're going to have the Great Awakening and science is going to start to pick up speed and two or three generations after that 60 to 150 years now by that time 150 years later everybody knows the Earth is not the center of the universe you had that in the church where the Deeds of the nicians yeah right and and we find out that they had the doctrine of balum they had the Deeds of the nians and and brother brandham goes back to church history to show to say listen it's you know it just started out as a little saying yeah that's right that the church wouldn't no we don't believe that what are you talking about nanism no we're against that oh well I'm just saying you know maybe don't you think we need to have a little bit of order to things we seem just a little scattered here and you know we were all piled up in Jerusalem and then persecution came we got scattered to the world we we had sold all of our houses and everything so we could all live common and now we got nothing amen remember the Theologian who interrupted brother brandham sermon said brother brandham said that was the greatest mistake the church ever made when they did that and brother brandham said the Holy Ghost make a mistake kind of preacher are you you don't need to understand it God Don't Make Mistakes you don't it's not about can you create a mathematical equation and say I was better I was worse that has God doesn't operate that way God is looking long range he knows what's best for you he knows what's best for me sometimes he we lose things to gain better things sometimes like job we do everything right and everything turns out wrong this is why our faith in Christ has to exceed our understanding of events your faith in Christ has to exceed the the pitfalls and ups and downs of your own life your faith has to exceed your failures and say but I still love him and I still believe him and I'll repent and I believe he forgives me well he forgave you last week he'll do it again this week he'll forgive me tomorrow and the next day and the next day because I am part of him so it actually you know all satan had to do in the Garden of Eden to permeate the Earth with Darkness even though the Fallen Angels multiply all he had to do was pollute the first generation that was all he had to do amen once he polluted that first generation those first parents of Adam and Eve then every man after that every man and woman boy and girl that would ever be born would be born in darkness and would be born with a fallen nature that could not even agree with God's word and so s then by remember brother BR talks about how that a demon spirit is almost powerless unless he can get someone to work through but you understand friends we we went from you know two people then we had hundreds then we had millions and then God re recycled it down to Noah and his family and then it wasn't very long after that you had a whole tribe of people in the valley of Shar building a a a a great uh sphere a great Spire a great tower and and then you had Babylon come along and then you had Nimrod carrying water to his neighbors we tracked all of this you know uh remember the man who said i' I've slown a man I slain a man to my wounding if and if and if Cain was this this then I'll be seven times that and you see it and and it kept kept going till finally it got to Noah's day and God just had to start all over again and then it grew again and then it got to Jesus day and that nation that crucified the word was destroyed and Scattered but did that stop St the devil the darkness kept growing but then the day of Pentecost uh illuminated some people but the darkness kept growing and we went from you know two to 100 to a th000 to 10,000 to 10 million to a billion to two billion to four billion to six billion 8 billion 8 and a half billion soon to be 9 billion and every time a hospital announces a little baby and they write a little new birth certificate Satan's influence is pro proactively growing throughout the Earth he didn't need for a fallen spirits to multiply all he had to do was break that first generation do you see why God had to take us back to the original word once you break it in any way then it all it does is perpetuate more darkness and more darkness and more Darkness but arise shine thy light has come the day star has arisen in our lives now we've come to the end of Darkness the day star has risen and there is a bride on the earth who is now the living Tabernacle of the living God's presence Hallelujah the world continues in its Darkness let's have my PowerPoint brother Josh I'm going to take this as I as I continue on and come to the close so the bride's time in the ages now that's an intentional the bride's time the reason I choose that is because brother Brenham hear me clearly brother Brenham interchanged almost equally bride's time with the bride age right with the Harvest Time so the bride Age The Bride time the Harvest time is all the same thing amen you understand so the bride age was never to be thought of as an eighth age it is a it is a time of the Bride within the last part of the last age after Christ has been put out then we have the word and the word only now there's there's two things that have happened to us sadly because as soon as people understood it as an eighth age then then you had all of these eighth age Messengers jumping up to elect themselves as the continuation of brother bram's Ministry and you've had this camp and that camp and this camp and that camp and this holy man and that holy man and this great gift and that great ministry in this and it's all these Kingdom building Ministries who who who thought that the bride age is a is something new it's an eighth it's back to the Eternal well absolutely the word has come back to its Eighth Day that's what the opening of the seals is all about it's absolutely true that in my soul I'm I'm already sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus but this body's still here amen this body is not in its Eternal day I mean people say oh we're in the Millennium now well if it is can I please have my money back because I'm quite disappointed if this is the Millennium but this is not the Millennium Hallelujah at best this is Purgatory I'm standing between Heaven and Hell and Hell has come to the surface and demon powers are streaming into the Earth but arise shine thy light has come am amen so you either had eighth age ministers jumping on board to say I'm the guy it's fine until guy number one starts arguing with guy number two and Guy number three who lives in another continent argues with guy number two and says guy number one's an idiot then guy number four says you're all three stupid I'm the man I I I started to I started to play it you know here uh I had a clip I played for my Ministry team and it was it went back to 1997 and it was in their annual isua Revival meeting that's what they call it 1997 and so you're going back decades and one of their their keynote speakers and you got all of these these Pentecostals by denomination not by experience but by denomination and I hope God I'm I'm quite sure God has brought many of them out brother Ernie was trapped in stuff like that till he come out there's been lots of people who were brought out brought into the into the uh Shining Light amen they they they came under the glow of the day star and they came out of her my people amen but even even 1997 all of those decades ago and this man starts preaching and the people are on their feet they're rejoicing you can hear shouts of amen and and little did that preacher know at that time 1997 it was just a drop in the bucket he had no clue of how it would burgeon into our day to where it is so such a large thing it has taken over Christianity completely except for among the bride at least that's where it shouldn't be and he he starts talking about the the the music industry and he he and he starts I I I probably should have played it but he starts talking about he says you know today we've got we we've got secular people singing Christian songs and we got Christian people singing secular songs and and and and we've got we've got preachers acting like motivational speakers and we got motivational speakers acting like preachers and we got prophets acting like acting like psych psychics and psychics acting like prophets and the church is just going in a circle and in a circle she don't even know what to do or where to go I'm glad God called us out of that I'm glad today that we see the Glorious light that's shining Hallelujah we have not followed cunningly devised Tales we have received the engrafted word hallelujah and so so you find then that that we have too many who tried to you know jump and say I'm this one I'm that one and then then the next Pitfall we ran into was people misunderstanding a couple of things a prophet said he first says you know that you can't mix Pentecost with this message and somehow I mean it it it takes my breath away but somehow they imagine that brother Brandon meant the original Upper Room experience in Jerusalem that you can't mix this message with the upper room experience The Upper Room experience was the message is the message it's the Jubilee it's the long awaited Jubilee the Earth had been waiting for for 4,000 years it was all through the te the Old Testament from Genesis on about how God would finally be able to not just dwell above or dwell with but he would dwell inside this was the long awaited Jubilee this was the power of God under salvation this was the living experience that's what that and I'm I'm going to show you here an example just in a minute and and so not realizing that brother Brandon was simply meaning that pent you can't mix this message with Pentecostalism meaning the denominations that the isua revivalist became the isua Revival was a part of the restoration of the brid tree it's part three of a four-face plan amen so so God was using it and just like Luther it was that brother brandham typed it to a wheat plant so like Luther is a stalk and when they denominated and the light moved on to the tassel the stalk became a dry stalk and there was no more life in it all the life had moved into Wesley's day and then when Wesley's day passed and the isua Revival started it went into what looked like the seed and the tassel went dry but then we found out that it actually wasn't the seed it was a shock that looked like the seed now we're not saying that the isua revivalists those great warriors of the faith back there oh they're just a shook well the age turned out to be that no no more than I would say oh John Wesley he's just a dried up tassel not insulting that that's that that truth is not to insult John or insult the azuza Revival it's not to insult Luther brother Ramon don't say he didn't have the Holy Ghost he did but we're talking about the full measure of the token and the full measure of the token has always been parallel and tantamount to the level of revelation of the word so they had the full Jubilee under a prophet's Ministry in the early Church of the alpha age amen that Alpha Church they had the Jubilee brother brandham said they had the abstract title deed they had the token they were the they were the ministry they not only had the office of the son of man in Paul they had the ministry of the son of man moving in the people why do you think Peter's Shadow and people got healed why do you think they could go out of jails and an angel why do you think they could speak boldly because they had the full token the message of this hour is not another gospel it's not an additional gospel it's the restoration of that original it's not an eighth one we don't need an eighth messenger we've come back to the full token back to the full abstract and when you do that you return back to the full power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost because the the the other fallacy becomes well but brother brandham said the word and the word only as if somehow he's meaning doctrinal teaching and doctrinal teaching only not only is that premise not true it has never been true in God's elect lady she has always had the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost brother Brandon proved that in the church Age series in the revelation of Jesus Christ series and went back to to polycarp and irenius and and he he he went between those two and he picked irenius and then from there he went to uh Martin and then from there he went to Columba and then from there it came into Sardis and Luther and Wesley and it went on and brother Brandon went through history and showed that the power and demonstration of the power of God was alive in every Church age even when they their Doctrine skewed off because they they and because that you can't disbelieve what you don't know and it wasn't revealed to them there was darkness and the and a seal was only partially open and and a mystery dropped down a messenger caught it partial and ran with the partial and the bride gathered around the partial it wasn't perfect but it gave them the new birth they'll be in the first resurrection you'll see them at the great table you'll sit across from them so the word and the word only never meant doctrinal teaching and doctrinal teaching only we have the word so we don't need the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit if you don't have the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit you don't have the Living Word you've got a dead letter because the letter kth it's the spirit that giveth life I'm not even saying you have any accurate Doctrine but the devil don't care how right you are in your Doctrine it's the life that he's afraid of see so you know I I have said to I I I I was asked one time said no brother we're with the opening of the seals we've got something more than they had and I just said well okay so let's just go with that for a minute can you answer some questions for me yes sure go ahead would you please tell me which doctrine that we believe that Paul didn't teach just name one what a baptism the godhead think Paul didn't teach on the godhead you think he didn't baptize those Baptist back there in in Upper coast of Ephesus and make them get re-baptized you think Paul didn't understand marriage and divorce he preached on on it you think he didn't understand the identity of MDC Paul knew so much about mzc he said I can't even tell you everything I know you become dull of hearing see it was already starting to to decline the serpent seed the original sin who wh Paul is the one who goes to the greatest example of that bear with me and indeed bear with me for I'm jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I've espoused you to to one husband and that's Christ but I fear as he was begal so you in the Simplicity of your mind and and so you realize that he's going right back to prove that that whatever you want to say of Eve she did not remain a faithful wife ESP spouse to one husband that's the whole point he's making and and and and if you don't agree with Paul then what in the world is he talking about what the the three-phase cycle of the Rapture Paul taught that we quote Pauls that that that we quote the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and the voice of the Archangel and the trumpet shall sound shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise we which alive and remain shall be changed in a moment Paul taught that cycle I mean which which Doctrine predestination oh goodness gracious election for ordination Paul was absolutely the master of it you you think you you think you can okay let let's play it uh take that down I'm uh the booth is dying to let me play it so I'm going to play it now you're going to read a posting at the top and all it says is 1997 30 years ago it's relevant today don't get distracted by that or you miss what the guy is saying all right let's have plenty of sound and let me know if you think it is still applicable you know world to the the lines have become so blurred until we got gospel singers singing secular music and secular singers singing gospel music and preachers looking like motivational speakers and motivational speakers trying to look like preachers and psychics trying to be prophets and Prophets acting like psychics and we're standing out here in the middle and we don't know where to [Applause] go the gospel music industry is filled with singers who have no Pastor who do not go to church but they have an agent who acts as a pimp to prostitute their gift to anybody who will pay the right amount of money I may never get to come back but I'm going to preach tonight [Laughter] you may not let me come back but I'm going to preach today that's what we're facing friends that's how the world got in the condition and that was 30 years ago I'm here to tell you something and and his cry was we need to come back to the truth they didn't it's only gotten worse until it's even permeated our ranks and sometimes I wonder where what kind of songs are we listening to that gets sung in the exact way that some secular artist sung a gospel song to worldly beat and we bring it right into our message churches I just say friends we need a wholesale repentance of these things and come back to the sacredness of the true word I you know I love powerful music Don't you'll never accuse me of that everybody knows brother Jason I Like it Loud I like it powerful I like my toe to tap I like my hands to clap I like jumping up and down I like running around I'm not against that but I'm here to tell you there's a there's a line that you can cross where all doing is doing something that's popular and Grievious to the holy spirit amen amen praise the Lord I hope y'all didn't ruin my sermon oh don't get me started let me get back to where I was so I'm G to try to wind up here with this right here so there's nothing that we Preach Today that's not a restoration of what Paul taught right if there is tell me what it is tell me what Doctrine and fact is you think that's something let me one up that when John goes to the aisle of patmas the prison Island Paul's already gone yeah John brings back a sealed mystery sealed under Seven Seals Paul's not even in the earth anymore that's why you don't hear Paul quoting from The Book of Revelation he never does because he's already gone he's already crossed over but isn't it amazing that when when the lamb steps forward and takes the book and looses the seals that had been sealed up when the church began to backslide amen they begin they had the original full Abstract title full word the son of man Ministry amen son of man office and Son of Man Ministry they had the full measure of it we're restored back to that when they begin to line and Fall Away the mystery of redemption was sealed up under Seven Seals but isn't it amazing that when a prophet comes in this day and God brings the message to him the unsealed word that when it comes in the message of the Seven Seals and every consecutive message afterward it agreed exactly and precisely with everything Paul taught us and Paul wasn't even in the earth when it was written I'm here to tell you friends we have not believed cunningly devised Tales we have been restored back to the original Faith see so so a bride's time is not doctrinal teaching and doctrinal teaching only the bride's time is not an eighth age for needing an eighth messenger I again the word I'll Grant you you want to say the word has come to its Eternal day amen so in that sense it's an eighth day there's really not an eighth day it just means back to the first day so it's went back to the original see and so so if people want to say I'm an eighth day messenger then I want to say then you're back to the original then let me see you produce the original life and the original Power and the original demonstration of the Holy Spirit but since they can't then they say well it's just doctrinal teaching and doctrinal teaching only which we've already shown the letter is what kills it's the spirit that gives life so so and then even though this is it back to its original Eternal day my soul is back to its original Eternal day this body's not the Earth is not even in the Millennium the Earth is not the Earth is in still in the seventh day living out a thousand years of that original day it'll go back to its Eighth Day when John when Peter said I saw new heavens and a new Earth for the first were passed away and there was no more SE see po Peter talks about it like being annihilated John sees it in a vision in the Book of Revelation so we realize then that what it is what is is the bride's time what is the bride's age it's a time within the last age just like the a time within the first age where they had the word and the word only meaning the pure word alone no man-made mongrelization no ad mixture it's the pure unadulterated that's the only way you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the only way you get the token I'm not saying you can't have an experience just like the ages had an exp experience but when you come to the word that becomes the full token and the requirement of your age those isus of fathers didn't have that they weren't required to have that Luther didn't have that he wasn't required to have that but you have it and you are required to have it see so so he so then I I showed whoops turn myself off so then I'm taking green means goat thank you so then we're talking about as a subtitle the Jubilee established and restored it was established in the original church and it's restored in the last Church true church watch to Ephesus unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things sayith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks now so Christ is in the midst of the church always all right we we believe that he walked in the midst of all seven lampstands all Seven Ages Christ walked in the middle of them you say Well then why why did they only have partial truth well if you'll notice that what he calls himself and this is what brother Brandon pointed out that really flipped theologians on their on their ear and brother brandham says notice that Jesus called himself the Alpha and the Omega he didn't say much about the middle he's walking in the middle but he called himself the first and the last not a lot about the middle he called himself the beginning and the ending but not a lot about the middle amen why because he would be the word and the word only in the first age and the word and the word only restored in the last age while Christ is walking in the middle the middle so so what it is is Christ in the middle of the ages yes but not everything in the ages is purely him you've got an ad mixture of man-made theology that's how it goes into the Dark Ages this is why the message came in this hour I will send to you Elijah the prophet to turn your hearts back to the faith of the original fathers we're not turning back into a partial understanding we've come all the way back to the original see all right I Know Thy Word thy labor and thy patience thou cannot bear them which are evil is a great church and thou has tried them which say they're Apostles and are not you know how they did that they put them to the Paul test you're not saying what Paul said that's right and has found them liars and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted see I want you to notice something for my name's sake you see that after you go from irenius into the third age you're going to get another mention one last time about his name and that's why brother Brandon would even say which a messenger comes at the end of the age that irenius was the last one with a clear understanding of the godhead so in the LA so in the third age then based on irenius that that teaching that handed off of baton to Martin there there was initially at the very early stage still some recognition of his name after that you don't see it again until you get to the sixth age of Philadelphia when he set an open door at the end of Philadelphia getting ready to go into leoda and you get a mention of the name again because why a revelation of an open door was Christ and they begin to understand baptism in jesus' name see so at this time they still got an understanding of his name and and for my name's sake has labored has not fainted nevertheless here's the problem here it comes here's that little lurking all he's got to do is pervert the first generation yeah and brother bam said it just started out as a little saying and then the next thing you know then it became a deed and then the next thing you know it became a full Doctrine and and after just a few 50 60 hundred years now they have already departed from everything in the full word they've still got some Revelation Irene is still understands the godhead but polycarp is already uh being warmed to the idea of NC leonism that's why brother Brandon went and choose him as a messenger and chose irenius over him because polycarp baned into that kind of language well we've got pastors but then we need a bishop see so you can see it already starting to go sideways remember therefore from whence Thou Art Fallen why do you think why do you think the Apostle starts writing letters to the church and says we need to earnestly contend for the faith once toiv delivered amen for men have gone into the world creeping into houses and leading silly women and captive and all these kinds of things are happening the gnostics are starting to emerge and they're starting to deny and are starting to say uh lascivious living is okay you don't have to be all Sanctified and you get all kinds of of people that's where that whole e easy believism started it started back there it's only come in this age and flowered out but it started back there and that's who John they didn't you know what they didn't believe they didn't believe that Jesus was a physical human you know why because if they believed if they accepted that Jesus was a physical human who did always that which the father showed him then they were obligated to do try to do the same thing and they didn't want to do that so they started to say oh well he wasn't actually a human he was he was an apparition he was a ghost he was an angel he was a a phantom and that's why John writes in his letter anybody who will not confess that Jesus Christ Has Come In the Flesh as an antichrist because those Apostles are battling against false Doctrine the church is starting to go off track amen so so he's saying here this is this is the summation of the age remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do th the first works or or else I will come unto thee quickly and remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent uh but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I also hate that's conquer the L that's hierarchical order put into the church he that hath an ear says this at the end of every age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the garden midst of the paradise of God all right now we come to the last age and unto the angel of the Church of the Leo Deans write these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot this is the church I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched this is the church miserable this is the church poor and blind and naked that's the leot toan church age that's his that's his overview of the whole church watch so that's really bad can you believe it could get worse it was as wor it was as bad as it could get until it wasn't and then it got worse I counsel thee here's the message buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white rant see this only comes by the word of God that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isaf that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent say well there's a little bit of Hope behold I stand at the door and knock if what he's been put out of his church he doesn't say that to any other church and in fact is friends do you realize that to the leoan church he has nothing good to point out they're just miserable poor blind naked he he warns them to buy isav you better repent he doesn't even have anything good to say do you know that in just the age prior in Philadelphia had nothing bad to say every age even Ephesus he had something bad you know you've done this you've Lo lost your first love you fell away but you do hate the Deeds of the nickel and so we're okay we're going to keep going he gets to Philadelphia to Wesley's age he doesn't even have a bad word the whole age is like beautiful how do you go from the sixth age when he doesn't have a single bad thing to say to the last age when he's got not a single good thing to say you understand Fallen Angels haven't multiplied but unbelief has multiplied because a message came and the message and his the messenger and his message were rejected and now Christ is put out of his church behold I stand at the door and knock at don't no other age suffered this but us if any man I'm not even calling the church I'm not going after denominations If any man that's mankind that's Humanity male or female if any man hear my voice open the door I will come into him and will St with him and he with me have you heard His Voice have you opened your heart to his voice you don't have to belong to their Church you have to belong to Christ and sub with me and he with me to him that over cometh overcome what the deception the deception that the last Church age is under to him that overcometh I will grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame him sat down with my father in his throne here it is again he that hath an ear see Mercy's not over even at the last age even when Christ is put out Mercy's not over he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches is there still Mercy yes yes did he claim the book yes so is there still Mercy yes whoever will have an ear to hear how do you get Redeemed by hearing the word and coming to the word and having an experience in the word you don't get it by joining a church not even this church so when we look then at the first age I couldn't make it bigger than that I apologize I probably could have but I just wanted to do this I'll help you understand it now this is The Seven Ages starting with Eep Ephesus and samna and pergamus and thyra and Sardis and Philadelphia and leoa I haven't put all that in there but you're familiar now the the ages are not to scale with history and time in fact is the middle age is the biggest of all it's the Dark Ages over a thousand years so I haven't made them to scale I just put them there for reference okay the first one and the last one are not the biggest ones but I'm just doing that so you can see so in the so in the first age you had a jubilee the token the quickening power power What followed that you had an anointed Prophet amen Paul got knocked out of his horse the church didn't start with Paul didn't start with an anointed Prophet it started with the Jubilee you get me it started with quickening power that's important then a prophet got called now did Paul become a prophet when God called him know he was always a prophet but he became an anointed prophet and then what happened then the message came and then you've got all the disciples including Peter who's supposed to be the spokesman for the church who's the one who has the keys to to to to Heaven and Earth actually says you're going to have to believe what Paul said or you're going to be lost Peter we really like you but don't like Paul then you're doomed because even I have to AC acquest to Paul yeah even my Revelation has to agree with his his don't have to agree with mine mine has to agree with his see you get me all right now listen friends I I'll give you a demonstration I started to use Ai and do a video but I just decided to just give you demonstration to keep it simple sometimes you just keep it simple stupid so so what happens you start with a jubilee with a token with quickening power then you get an anointed Prophet then you get a message and then all you're doing at the end time under restoration what's at the end here Jubilee token quickening power is that at the is that is that at the end is that at the beginning then when you bring it around to the ending what does it end with quickening power what does it start with look what does it start with a mighty Angel descended open the book send it down to a prophet then you have an anointed Prophet was William brandom only a prophet when the seals came no he was always a prophet but Malachi 4 was not fulfilled until now you've got a a prophet who was born a prophet is now an anointed Prophet who receives the word and gives it to the people and the age finishes with the Jubilee restored the token restored quickening power restored I don't understand people who say we don't have the quickening power it started with it it's ending with it that's why a prophet came that's why a message came Hallelujah friends we have the quickening power therefore God started his church like he wanted it now he wants it like he started it and all it's done you say well why why did why did it start with Jubilee because you didn't even have a church until the Jubilee was there you didn't have it until the token was in play and then it called a prophet and then he had a message but in our day a message comes a prophet is called and we leave here under quickening power we leave here under the full measure of the Jubilee the full measure of the token oh friends I cannot make it plainer to you today don't let anybody ever tell you that the word and the word only is just doctrinal teaching and that's all we need that's not what we stop end with we end with quickening power power we end with the Saints Rising we end up with our bodies being changed so don't tell me it's an eighth age it's a bride's time within the last age both the the whole church ages the whole church ages remember Alpha and Omega yes amen so the the whole age started with the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit God bookended this age with a prophet who had a message and the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit and he bookends to the last age with a prophet with a message and the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit he's the alpha and he's the Omega he's the first and he's the last he's the beginning of the creation of God you are the continuation of that same creation Ephesus a continuation that's that's why they had the ministry of the son of man because they were a continuation of the ministry of Jesus Amen what what is the office of Son of Man Prophet what is the ministry of the son of man the word made flesh you understand Jesus was was the prophet he was he was the son of man as a prophet but he was the word made flesh and when the Holy Spirit came down down into the church in the upper room now the Life of Christ is Multiplied into the people he's the beginning of the creation of God because that that term brother Brandon points out doesn't make logical sense because how God's not created so how does it call him the beginning of the creation of God that's that's jammed up that's that that's that's that's that's just combobulated he God wasn't created so what happened is God condescended into a human and then God took that human to the Cross amen and then that body went into the tomb and then it raised up it ascended on high that body laid on a mercy seat God took the life that was in the body which was his life and sent it back into the church and you're the continuation of that original creation that is what has been restored to this day and this hour my friends stand on your feet and rejoice with me this morning because arise you have Arisen the light is shining in our day we have come to the end of Darkness hallu Darkness permeated Darkness multiplied it will continue to multiply the only thing that can save the 144,000 is because they receive this message Israel as a nation that's why the Bible says they're born in a day you say wait a minute the six point star of David is the oldest flag known to human history it that's been flying for thousands of years Israel was a nation all the way back they had a king they had a they had everything but Israel becomes a nation in a day because Israel rejected their Messiah but at the end time there's 144,000 12,000 out of each tribe yes amen it's amazing that even balum saw that when the wise listen when the wise men came following a star they were following balam's prophecy because because the anointing of Christ can fall on a false vessel and he'll prophesy truth it happened to Bam it happened to Caiaphas amen balum saw him at the end time and he saw all the tribes in their tribal order in their tents that's Feast of Tabernacles that's the Millennium you understand I don't have time to teach on that today but balam actually saw what the end of that would be and why did they get restored back because the word that they rejected they Moses and Elijah take it to them when the bride are gone is gone when the bride lifts off of the earth that's it for the Gentiles then there's no more Mercy for the Gentiles because the bride is the blood of God by the spirit the bride guide is the continuation of the word she's she is the The Living Word she has she carries a living message you understand so Redemption only comes through that word doesn't you don't have to come to me for your Redemption but I'm preaching a word that will as the only thing that can give you Redemption amen we're not here to exalt a man we're here to exalt the man amen and once that bride who's the blood of God by the spirit cuz it's a bleeding word cuz life is in the word blood the blood is in the word that's why John said if we walk in the light as he's in the light then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from sin so you have to walk in his word to get the cleansing of the blood say well I I I I I read the sinner's prayer Jesus Christ Son of God died to save Sinners I accept that I'm born again well you might be on your way to a new birth but you haven't got the token yet you've only got the token when you have said amen to the engrafted word of this hour that's why God sent a message that's why God sent if you reject that message you'll end up in a tribulation period I don't care what kind of a Christian you say you are and and when the bride goes home then the blood is gone for the Gentiles God sees all the sin of the world and that's what starts the tribulation that's what lets the judgments loose now that eagle anointing doesn't go home doesn't go back to the throne that eagle anointing lifts up flies East picks up Moses and Elijah and goes to the 144,000 with this same gospel message of the token they receive it and then they're brought up with Moses and Elijah to be in the Millennium they're part of the first resurrection the foolish virgin aren't part of the first resurrection but they get enough of the truth they agree with just enough of the truth to not take the mark of the beast see they die they give their life in the tribulation they die as Martyrs and at the great white Throne they're given a fair trial and a judgment God looks in their heart to see if they believed everything he revealed to them he can't condemn them for what he didn't reveal but whatever he revealed they better not be guilty of condem of of refusing it see doesn't matter what kind of Life they lived whatever God reveals to you you are obligated to believe it or be doomed see amen oh friends what an hour what a day that we live in amen what's going to sing brother Kenny go ahead my brother shom shom peace and good
