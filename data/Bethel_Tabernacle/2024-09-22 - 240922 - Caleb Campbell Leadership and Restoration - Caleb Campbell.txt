and different things in his life the devil had chains on him but God had set him free so he said if I ever could have the devil sitting down this is what I'd tell him not recognize [Music] now change

and and what he was delivering had been my heart for this service this weekend and and some of the same things this morning with with brother Matt and Sunday school and uh it seems like it's if it's heavy on the Lord's heart then it should be heavy on our heart amen and it just seems like that's where the Lord's taking us this morning so and all I want to know is I just want to hear from the Lord this morning amen have an uplifted hand who wants to hear from the Lord I want his define thoughts I just want to move out of the way this morning and I believe if you have a need on your heart I believe the Lord can discern that need you know we stand up here as ministers trying to not just trying to preach a sermon but trying to find the channel of the holy spirit amen and to try to let him operate through US amen we're we're back there praying and we have notes and we do these things but I can't say nothing that would be a blessing unless God comes in the service amen and anoints it amen so if you have a need this morning just lift it up in your heart God knows he can minister to that need even if it's not in my notes amen um we just want to remember pastor as well um my my Dad's foot actually as well he he's been suffering the last several weeks he's got a burn and he stayed home today so let's remember him in prayer sister Jean and and and those that are away Min uh ministering as well so let's just remember them in prayer let's turn right to the word we're going to turn to Joshua 24 Joshua chapter 24 we're going to read verses 15 verses 14 and 15 you just set that there for thanks bro and then we're going to turn into the book of 2 Chronicles this morning 2 Chronicles so it reads this now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you shall serve whether the gods which your fathers serve that were on the other side of the flood or the god of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord who makes that declaration with me this morning amen let's turn over in the Bible to 2 Chronicles the 34th chapter we're going to kind of jump around in this but uh Lord had had it on my heart to read a portion of this so we'll just start in verse one at 2 Chronicles 34:1 it says Josiah was 8 years old when he began to Reign and he reigned in Jerusalem 1 and3 years and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord and walked in the ways of David his father and declined neither to the left hand nor to the right I'm sorry neither to the right hand nor to the left for he was for it was in the eighth year of his Reign while he was yet young and he began to seek after the god of David his father and in the 12th year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places and The Groves and the carved images and the molten images and they break down the altars of balum in his presence and the images that were on high above them he cut down in the Groves and the carved images and the molten images he break in pieces and made dust of them and stoed stro it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them and he burnt burnt the burn bones of the priests upon their altars and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem skipping down to verse 8 it says now in the 18th year of his Reign when he purged the land and the house he sent shaan the son of ailah and Messiah the governor of the city and joah the son of jehoahaz the recorder to repair the house of the Lord his God so this was the beginning of a work to rebuild and to restore the house of the Lord amen and when you move to verse 14 and it says and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Lord hilaya the priest found a book of the law of the Lord given by Moses and Hil kayap answered and said unto schaen the Scribe I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord and hkaya delivered the book to schaen so what happened is is as they begin working on the restoration of the house of the Lord they found this word they found this book amen God had a book that he had preserved amen that God preserved throughout all the ruins and of all the bad decisions that had been made amen moving down to verse 18 and it says then schaen the Scribe told the king saying hilaya the priest hath given me a book and Shea and read it before the king and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the law that he Ren his clothes and the King commanded Hokah and aim and the son of schaen and abdon the son of Micah and schaen the Scribe and asiah the servant of the king saying go inquire of the Lord for me for them that are left in Israel and in Judah concerning the words of the book that is found for great is the Wrath of the Lord that is poured out upon us because of our fathers they have not kept the word of the Lord to do after all that is written in the book so the next few verses he did exactly what the Lord has always done he gave the word to the prophet amen and what did Josiah do is he inquired of the Lord through that Prophet glory and he says in verse 26 and as for the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the Lord so shall ye say unto them thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel concerning The Words which thou has heard because thy heart was tender and thou did humble thyself before God when thou heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof and humbled thyself before me and did rent my clothes and weep before me I have even heard thee also sayeth the Lord hallelujah behold I will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of the same so they brought the king word again Hallelujah and the King stood verse 31 and the King stood in his place and made a covenant before the Lord to walk after the Lord and to keep his Commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all of his heart and with all of his soul to perform the words of the Covenant which are written in this book and he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it and the inhabit inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the Covenant of God the God of their fathers and Josiah took all the Abominations out of the countries and that pertained to the children of Israel and made all that were present in Israel to serve even to serve the Lord their God all his days they departed not from following the Lord the god of their fathers amen I'd like to take a thought this morning on leadership and restoration let's just go before the Lord Heavenly Father we thank you for the reading of your word this morning Father how I can already feel your presence here and I'm so grateful for it Lord Jesus I pray that you'd anoint the words anoint the hearers Lord to hear and to receive your word this morning Father speak to us Lord God in a Divine way I ask Lord come and just show yourself to us Lord God we humble ourselves before you just like Josiah did Lord we're inquiring of you Lord God the same way Lord God that you've always had it done father we look to you father the the king of the world this morning in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you this morning as you take your seats last time we spoke here we touched on on there that first scripture I I turned to which I would like to think as Joshua's last sermon Amen to the people of Israel there from our opening text and this would be his final declaration some of his final words to all those that had followed him into the promised land I believe that Joshua was begin Wasing people he began to see the idol worship to raise up in their households he saw how they were compromising on the words of the Lord so he was compelled to declare those words choose you this day whom You Shall Serve and he says if you choose this God if you choose God the one who delivered you and your fathers out of that land then you need to do it and serve him in sincerity and in truth amen it had to be the duality of serving him in sincerity and serving him in truth Amen brother random actually takes that scripture there in Joshua 24 and he uses it to preach a text sermon in 1962 the conflict between God and Satan amen and he began to show the ways in which God chose to fight against the enemy and the tactics the devil chose to fight against the family of God all throughout the ages amen from the beginning even before the beginning God knew exactly how he was going to choose to fight against his family amen he knew every tactic that the enemy would ever use amen and brother bandham says that because he knew the and he knew how he was going to fight he fortified his family with the atomic weapon of weapons Hallelujah he chose the very best thing that he could have ever chose and that was his word amen the infinite God chose the infinite word amen that's why it's so vital that we stand upon every word of God Amen and we don't look at anything Through The Eyes of modern Theory or Through The Eyes of modern culture amen because God chose this word and with that word we see him defeat the enemy every place in every situation Hallelujah in every circumstance all throughout the ages amen but it cannot be a fraction of the word or even what he was saying this morning it cannot be 99% it can't be done with sincerity alone it has to be with the truth you've got to have the unadulterated word of God Amen a few weeks ago in our Sunday school we were showing how Cain with a true sincerity in his heart he had took a version of the word amen and he tried to do something without having the right Revelation amen and look at what it led to amen it shattered a family's life it caused a man to shed blood the first time in history it led to a mother and a father having to grieve for their child for the first time in history amen you you know I think sometimes people read about Cain and they think he was this no horrible this no good heathen but that's not what the scripture says amen he was a follower of God he worshiped God he went to church brother bham said he built an altar the same as Abel did but it was contrary to the line and Order of God's word it was contrary to the the design that God had set in order amen and anything contrary to that word proves what it is by the evidence amen it proves by what it produces amen when Cain was offering his his sacrificed on the altar it looked a whole lot better than Abel's amen and the natural eyes could behold the beauty and its sincerity but its evidence came a few verses later amen because the fruition was it was murder and hate amen and death and sorrow the prophet says this in 1962 he says the conflict between God and Satan he says Satan had has his system at work again to get people to misbelieve the word of God Amen Satan's wrong way of worship like Cain and like balam they were very religious Cain was religious he brought he bought brought an altar he made an offer and frankly Cain was more religious than Abel he sure was he done more for the Lord than Abel but but Abel came in the way of the Lord that's all he done more he built a great denomination he built a great thing a great Christian Heritage but you see he come in the wrong way and it wasn't received now wrong it was contrary to the word amen and brother Brenham begins to contrast balum that that old Prophet there in the Old Testament that had sold out for money and for popularity and he says you know balum was just as religious as Moses was he came with the same sacrifice the same clean animals everything and he prayed to the same God you you start to go read about balum and everything that God does it seems that he's doing the right thing but he's not in the line and Order of God's word because he says you need to bless my people and this man that you're serving he's trying to curse my people and the fruition came versus later when balum was found on the enemy's territory when he was dead because he stayed on the wrong grounds hallelujah it's so important where you stand on the word of God hallelujah and I want you to notice this morning he says the word won't mix with modern Theory see you can't have modern Theory now in closing listen close the word won't mix with any modern Theory you can't have Theory and and the word you've got to have the word or the theory now which are you going to believe he begins to say if the if the Bible teaches baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and the church says Father and Son and Holy Ghost then who are you going to believe if Jesus says be born again and the church says come join a church now what are you going to believe if Jesus says these find shall signs shall follow them that believe and the church says you're just a good member who are you going to believe Hallelujah and he skipping down he says now Christians stay behind the word of God amen yes sir wrong way of life trying to mix it today today they take these women that's dressed any way they take these men if they smoke or drink or anything else and they make them deacons and so forth in the churches even pastors dress women any way they want to dress and bring them in and make them sisters in the church don't you ever try to get to heaven like that it won't mix with modern Theory Hallelujah modern Theory and modern culture would teach that it doesn't matter the way that men and women dress the way that we act the things that we associate with they would say that it's oldfashioned for a woman not to cut her hair or to not wear pants but according to God's infinite word amen it does matter because it's in his word and he chose that thing to fight the enemy all down Through the Ages amen Holiness living and standards have always been a part of God's word amen and we know as Believers of God's word we won't take even a slight compromise on that thing amen because because we know what the evidence of that thing is amen we know what the evidence of compromising is you live a sincere life you love the Lord so did Cain but he died he died and he didn't have God on his side because he wasn't in the line of order of God's word and just because the enemy has had 6,000 years to pervert that idea and raise up this popular culture that says otherwise that doesn't mean that we accept any other version of God's word amen if the Christian world would just look at these biblical truths without the lens the modern lens of the popular culture that we live in today maybe they would have isav to see maybe they would understand these things maybe they wouldn't be foreign Concepts they're not foreign Concepts to us because we believe God's word we believe everything he says amen and we want in our hearts to follow every word of God Amen Satan the deform you know it's always been God's way to transform your life amen we read you know Romans 12 it says that Bible says transformed by the renewing of your mind but it's always been Satan's way to try to deform that thing Amen to get us to conform to the ways of the world from the very beginning of all things he set it up in his mind to have sons and daughters walk contrary to the word of God and deform God's perfect way you know and what can happen many times saints of God is you let the enemy into into your mind and it deforms your growth real true Sons and Daughters of God born again of the spirit of God but you leted something in your mind you don't take that thought captive and then it begins to grow and it deforms your growth as a Believer there's still trying to grow brother bom says they're still a seed of God and they think that they're maturing in the word but all the time Satan has got in their mind somewhere amen and brother Brenham says it like this in God's power to transform he says now and we are still in the image of God and but some are so deformed as sons of God that walk contrary to his word and to the way that he had us and provided for us to walk setting something the world twists us all out of the way pull us close to it and away from the straight narrow strip that he planted Us in to be Sons and Daughters of God sin has done this evil thing to the Sons and Daughters of God and he begins to just start talking about how when he was a game and he would go and he'd walk in the in in in Indiana where there's a lot of corn fields and and if he would watch a branch and the branch would fall on a stock of corn and that stock of corn would try to grow but it was growing in a deformed way amen and it was still trying to grow and brother Brena makes the contrast between believers who what they have something in their life a branch grows you know something happens in your life and you're still trying to grow but you're growing in a deformed way you need to go back to whatever that thing is and you need rid that thing of your life you need to find out whatever it is you say God if I don't know what it is but my life is in ay then discern my heart because that's what he can do he can show you exactly where you're out of the word Satan will get you to compromise on some part of the word no matter how small and then we think we're growing amen but until you get back into cater that straight amen until whatever is hindering its growth is removed until whatever area of your life is back in alignment with God you know it's not it's not popular to preach these things you know for families to have Holiness standards but we don't stand with the Fashions and the families of the world Amen and men and women that are truly Born Again of the spirit of God that's the only kind of water they want to drink amen that's the only kind of water I want to drink I want to drink the Waters of the water of life amen I want someone to come up in here and tell me how I need to live and how I need to act because I know that's how I'm going to make a Rapture and that's how God is going to get his family to where it needs to be because he he chose this way amen he chose prophets to work through he chose ministers amen he chose these things so I want to listen to whatever God has chosen amen hallelujah you know it's against modern Theory to say that it's it's a man's duty to lead the home amen but sisters that have a true experience with God want nothing less than that amen because they know that that's God's Perfect Design and they know that if the husband is truly being led by Christ that he'll love and cherish her just like God loves and cherishes the church Hallelujah and it'll be in her heart to want to follow that kind of leadership amen and once you understand the whole picture you wouldn't want anything less than God's design on it amen I wouldn't want anything less than the way God had intended it because he sees my future I don't amen he sees the things I'm going to face I don't he knows that if I'm out of line in order of God's word then down the road if I'm facing the enemy and I'm not in line with this then he can't help me because he needs to be in line and order with God's word that's right Hallelujah Brothers amen we need to make sure Christ is the one that's leading Us in every decision that we make the moment that you start trying to lead yourselves or lead your family without the headship of Christ you're going to ruin the whole design amen you want to stick out your chest and be something no we have to be humble enough to say God is the one that's our headship amen God is the one that's making those decisions for us because once you're in line amen then your wife will be in line amen and everybody's going to be in a part of God's design and it's going to be a beautiful picture amen it's not some misogynistic way of looking at it it's the line and Order of God's word and it's a beautiful picture amen it's such a beautiful uh portrait of how God set an order of family God's design is always perfect amen I know I know these are these are Elementary Concepts but I believe it's important to drive these things down to make sure that they're not forgotten Concepts you know just because it's not the popular thing anymore we still stand with God's word no matter how oldfashioned it gets amen young people stand take a stand against the ungodly immoral way that this world has been deceived into thinking is the normal way amen at the age of 16 in our opening uh at the age of eight he began Josiah began uh taking he took leadership of the kingdom and he set his heart toward God at a young age then at the age of 16 he started breaking down those false altars and he had he followed the footsteps you know if he followed the footsteps of his natural father he would have been ruined he would have died in the same sin that they died in but he took a stand against popular culture at a young age amen and you watch how throughout his whole Kingdom that the chapter 34 all the way to the end of his kingdom everybody in that kingdom was following the word of God because he set in order he established that this is the way that my kingdom will run amen saints of God you have a kingdom amen you have a kingdom in your heart amen and God wants to rule that thing and if you let him rule that thing then at the end of your road F Hallelujah at the end of your road you're going to find yourself in the line in order of God's word and he'll take you all the way with him Hallelujah you know Israel had gotten to such a point in their society you know from the evil of people that the Bible says that even sodomites felt comfortable enough living next to the house of the Lord you go read the first part of the book of 2 Chronicles you know this was this was actually at the start of it was such a high point in Israel's time you know Solomon was King and under under his headship the Temple of the Lord had finished its construction and the fifth chapter begins describing the events that took place while they were dedicating the temple the glory of God in 2 Chronicles 5:13 it says it came to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord when they lifted up their voice and trumpets and symbols and instruments of music music and praise the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever that then the house was filled with the cloud even the house of the Lord the presence of the Lord after the after the dedication of the temple was so incredible it says so much that that the priest could not even stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house they couldn't even stand have you ever been in a in a situation where the presence of the Lord is so strong in your life you know he's doing something you can't even stand in that presence for the place you're standing on his Holy Ground they couldn't even stand amen and yet just a few Generations later when Josiah took leadership he began sanctifying the land sodomites were living in the kingdom and they were not even just living in the Kingdom they had gotten so comfortable living in the kingdom it says the Bible says that they encamped next to the house of the Lord you know and if you go and read those the books of the Kings and the Chronicles even in the succession of the Kings during those time that that the ones that did right in the sight of the Lord the Bible says the high places were still not taken out of Israel saints of God that's why you can't ever let the fire of God die in your life you've got to have a fresh Revival every single day you've got to die out those little bits of compromise that don't seem like such a big deal now there seeds and the longer you let a seed grow the more evidence it brings of what going to sprout on the inside of that thing amen you start Towing the line of Holiness in your life it shows what seed you're watering you start CH Towing the line and your church attendons you start Towing the line and letting the Fashions of the world in your life you watch the fruit of that seed and you know in this situation it took generations of Filth and sin but saints of God it doesn't take that long today we live in Satan's Eden you make a choice and a decision and if it's not in line and order with God's word you watch that seed begin to grow it's going to rapidly go and before you know it you're in this conglomeration of sin that you know that only God can take you out of this place you let what happened you you let the enemy in your mind Start begin fellowship with your thoughts those seeds grow you know when Josiah began seeking after the Lord he chose the harder way I love that quote when brother brandham he was given that prophecy it says because you chose the harder way he says it in the true Easter SE much of Heaven awaits you because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou has not thou has walked of your own choosing now here the man watch How It's wrote It's wrote in forign words thou has picked the correct and precise deis decision and it is my way that's the way I want saints of God I want his way amen you know we've chosen the way with the Lord's despised Fe few I fixed it up with Jesus a long time ago Hallelujah and you know when you start to take sides with God you aren't declaring a path of least resistance you've got to fight your way there amen life living a life as an overcomer doesn't just happen overnight God takes you through seasons and growth and maturing but at every juncture you can look back and you can say praise the Lord because I watch the Lord do this in my life and that in my life I had situations that I know I needed to correct but by God's grace I made it through amen even in situations I didn't know how to correct but I gave it to the Lord and now I can watch how that thing was just completely abolished because God when God's hands are in it when you let God's hands be in control he's able to take those things which are broken those crooked paths and he's able to straighten them out amen but first you've got to Humble yourselves before God you got to own up to your mistake you got to say God I'm sorry for how I'm living but I don't want to be living this anymore I want you to be ruling my life I want you to be the one leading me every decision I make and he's going to start taking you to places that you didn't even know that you could go Hallelujah you just got to take a stand for God then you watch him do only what he can do you know even when you're faced with difficult decisions Saints you're sometimes you're faced with a pile of ruins when Joshua recognized that the the lack of Jehovah God in his kingdom he was faced with a hard Choice confront it headon and tear down these strongholds or continue down the easy path the path of least resistance and it was at that time that Joshua began to purge the idols and the carved images as a teenager saints of God he began to do these things and I want you to catch what happens at the beginning after he started pursuing the Lord God began doing a larger work amen he had a word that he was preserving the whole time amen the the the book of the law of Moses he was preserving that thing the whole time and he always had a plan it was prophesied 300 years before this that Josiah would come and that he would Reign he had a plan to restore he has a plan to restore your life he has a plan to restore those bad decisions you made you just got to humble yourself before God you just got to commit it to him amen the Bible says that he humbled himself before the Lord it doesn't matter how many years that the devil has corrupted amen while they were rebuilding the priest they found this book I just want to say SS of God it doesn't matter how far you've gone in your life amen it doesn't matter the wreckage there's a seed on the inside of your soul God has a plan of restoration and he can do it amen I want you to have confidence in that you just you just got to be willing to stand on the word amen he chose the harder way you know we serve a God in the restoring business you know all all the years there that the Bible says the Locust ate all the years the Palmer worm ate all the years the cankerworm all the years the caterpillar you know and we remember when the prophet teaches us that in so many places that that's the same insect just in four stages amen it's the same devil amen it's the same enemy that Josiah had to fight way back then he's the same liar that he is today and it's the devil that came in in different coats amen dressed a little differently and it's the same thing today presenting the church with things that look so appealing the same thing he did with Cain amen Jesus said that they would have the same anointing and the prophet taught us in the church age book that they would preach what seemed to be the same thing we preach the churches would still preach salvation through Jesus Christ they would preach the power of God but I want you to notice this so did judas's scariot amen and because they are of the wrong seed it produces the wrong thing you know Cain had a sincere heart with a part of the true word but it produced death and when Josiah heard the words of the book of the law and the Declarations it made that God would pour out his wrath upon the land it said that because Israel has forsaken me like they promised they would never do I will bring evil Upon This Place sometimes you hear those words and man Lord oh because the wrath of God the judge judgement of God isn't always what people like to hear but they had caused it from a lifestyle that they chose when they heard Joshua's message and they didn't apply it to their lives and then generation after generation they began to Let the Fire Die amen but you have to catch Josiah's attitude here it says that he humbled himself to the Lord and inquired of the Lord through the way God always chose to do it amen a prophet I'm so grateful that we have a prophet of this day that we can inquire any time we need when when we live in the most corrupted of times in the worst of days amen we have the words of God's messenger that we can look to no matter how many people thought he was too harsh or too hard on people get too involved in people's life that's the kind of gospel that I want preached amen I want something that convicts me that digs into my life in the way that I dress and the way that I live because I know those things matter to God Joshua Jos inquired of the Lord amen and God spoke and told Josiah because thy heart was tender before me and thou humbles thyself before me my brother my think of sister think of it now today God was going to pour out his wrath there was so much evil throughout the land that God couldn't even stand it but one man a leader a true leader raised up in the midst of all of it and God said because of the Purity and the humility of this man's heart all the things that will come to pass your eyes won't behold it oh my because you stood for my word even when it was hard you and everybody in your kingdom during your Reign won't endure my wrath glory to God stand upon the word means something friends it's not just another denomination all those years the enemy tried to destroy God's word Through The Years amen God preserved the word amen I'm talking about now in our day and now in the culmination of God's plan and all of it at the end he brought it back into restoration this message that we preach is Christ it's the second coming of almighty God and it's the same kind of restoration in our day amen it's this it's the Fulfillment of scripture and I stand up here to say it's not a time to compromise amen it's not a time to to tow the line of compromise it's a time to get every aspect of your life in line in order with God's word amen hallelujah Hallelujah now is a Time To Worship it's a time to stand for the truth of God's word in an evil day we're living so close to the End Amen this is this is it friends this is it young people now is a time to take a stand on the word that you've heard preached and I believe saints of God that anything that you're facing in your life God is God is more than able to do it he can restore Health in your in your body he can restore families he can restore all the years that the devil has destroyed you just turn your heart towards his word amen you you just make the Declaration right now and you watch God start to make these changes in your life I'm a witness this morning I've had things that came up in my life I didn't know how to do it I didn't know where to go with it but I was like Lord I need this changed and now I can look back on that situation and say it's just the grace of God that picked that thing up and was able to mend it and break it to to break me of it amen and now I can look and I can just say thanks be to God Amen takes the right attitude though amen Jo Joshua Josiah approached God in pure humility said I know this area of my life I know this area of my kingdom needs fixed and I've got to commit it to you amen sometimes I know it can feel difficult especially when you've got a family and you got kids and you've got areas that have gone years and years without God being in the center of it amen but sometimes he's just looking for you to take ownership of it amen just take ownership of your faults you know we live in a world today where everybody has somebody to blame for what's wrong in their life amen we live in a world where you know everything is is somebody else's fault amen don't buy into that modern theory of weakness amen it's a weak attitude that breeds the wrong thing in your life God wants men and women to take ownership of their wrongs amen maybe another person did wrong you maybe a church did wrong you maybe a pastor a friend whatever it is take that thing to God right now amen Josiah took rulership of his kingdom amen and his father and his grandfather had ruled and they destroyed it with sin and years of wreckage and wrongdoings but his attitude didn't Express all the things that he had to fix amen his attitude was humble toward God lord I know there's a lot of things in my life that I need to fix I don't know how to do it but I know you can do it and he humbled his heart and God did just that Hallelujah he didn't stand up there and say well it was their fault that this happened or that happened happened amen you know sometimes we pick we do we pick up traits in our life because of traumas that happen because of wrongs that people have done to us and that's just the reality of it amen it's just it's sin it's how broken the world is now but God is in the fixing business amen he formed you in your mother's womb he knows how to write that wrong he knows how to make that crooked pass straight hallelujah hallelujah he knows how to heal that scar you know and when you when you do make a mistake because I know I've got Sons and Daughters of God sitting in this congregation this morning I know when you do make a mistake amen sometimes it's not about what you did wrong he doesn't want you to stay there when you fall don't stay down but how are you going to let that thing shape what your next move is amen you know we read that story there in in Jo with Joshua you know when When sin had gotten into Israel's Camp before the Battle of AI there with Joshua as the captain of the army amen we're familiar there and then they suffered casualties amen they he said Joshua had sent out these these members of the army and he he didn't inquire the Lord there was sin in his camp with aen and those men died amen and you know there was a travesty in the kingdom and Joshua C came to this point Lord oh I don't know what to do you said I would I would tread on every enemy but now this enemy has defeated us what's wrong and so we inquir to the Lord and God purged that thing in his life amen and I just want you to notice tonight this morning God can do the things that we don't know how to do and he's not looking for you to stay down he's not looking for you to look at the mistake that you made he wasn't going to say yeah AI beat you yeah I need you to go and take a different path no I want you to stand back up right now cuz I'm going to show you how to defeat that thing get that wedge out of your life get that sin commit it back to me and I'm going to stand you back on your feet and I'm going to have you go and face that enemy I'm going to show how you will overcome I'm going to show that you can do it still and it wasn't the next it wasn't two battles later it was the next battle he stood up and fought against Ai and defeated that enemy amen saints of God it's a type in your life you've got something that you're facing today God wants you to stand back up commit it to him and show that you can overcome that thing no matter what the situation is no matter how many times the devil has wronged you no matter how many times the devil has deceived you no matter how many times you've wronged in that specific area in your life God wants you to to stand back up and overcome that thing this morning amen he doesn't want justifications and reasons and Joshua didn't come before him and say well it was ain's fault no he wants you to own up to the decision that you made you made a wrong you made a wrong choice just own up to that wrong choice because he's got a helping hand he's going to lift you up he's going to send you back out to battle Hallelujah he's going to make it right don't let that failure weaken your faith saints of God don't let it you're going to fall it's bound to happen but what will you do after you fall the devil is all the trime trying to get us to look at our def defeat at our past while God is always trying to get you focused on your future and on the victory of ahead amen glory to God they're back in in talking about Josiah there in the Kingdom the Feast of Passover you know we're familiar with this Feast that took place uh it was one of the things that Josiah actually brought back into yearly worship and this celebration it had been a a symbol just as a a minute here to show what it what it was it had been a symbol after The Exodus amen the Israelites had been living in bondage for so many years and God had be dealing with Moses and Pharaoh on his people slavery and in the midst of all those plagues and all those woes that God was bringing down on Egypt God had made a declaration he said this month shall be the beginning of months to you it was a new beginning for the people of Israel amen and God said his instruction to Moses was he said take a lamb each household without spot or blemish amen and kill it in the evening time and take the blood of that sacrifice and strike it on every doorpost and then take the Flesh in the night and roast it with fire see he was specific about his instructions and it's the same sacrifice today saints of God except you don't have to have a bloody lamb in anymore you you had the lamb and he shed his blood for you but you have to do the same thing amen you still have to Oly the same blood on your doorpost amen glory to God the new birth is our beginning of months amen for that new life but for that new life to take effect saints of God there first had to be a death and that lamb had to die that's right God said burn it burn the flesh with fire and eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover so that's that's what the Passover was that was what it signified amen and he said God said for all those who have the blood applied to their homes I will pass over them but all those who wouldn't take the word that God had for them amen and all those who wouldn't listen and heed to the message of my Prophet Moses I will Smite and execute judgment on that household but when I see the blood I will pass over you you praise the name of the Lord it signifies the same thing today judgment is coming to strike the land God has to purge the leaven from this world all the sin and the corruption amen and in order for for for him to pass over it's got to be the blood I I hope you can catch that this morning Saints you've got to have the blood covering it's got to you've got to have Christ's blood represented in your life it's got to be the word amen made flesh amen something that's real and living a reality to you it can't be words on a page young people it can't just be you coming to church it can't just be you listening to the message it's got to be a living reality you've got to have the the blood the fresh blood of God living as a as a token as a as a memorial as something that you display in your life amen it's got to be on constant display one thing I noticed when I was studying this is that you know many many you could go and you could slay the lamb amen and you could eat the you could eat the Passover you could do all those things but unless you got your hands dirty amen unless you dipped your hand in that blood and you started applying it to the doorpost then that then that Death Angel would still come into your house amen you could think you're living right but until you've given everything to God Amen you've got to have it on display in your life you've got to make Jesus Christ the center of every decision you make of every situation in your life and it's got to be on display amen the blood has to show on your doorpost amen hallelujah Hallelujah I know that's simple but don't find yourself just believing the word amen it doesn't it doesn't matter how many times that you've uttered the words out of your mouth it doesn't matter how many times you've attended a church service it doesn't matter how many T times that you've said you love the Lord until you've made that a living reality in your soul until you've made it on your doorpost of your home and your life then it will not count because God's word is always the same it's never changing Hallelujah glory to God you've got to go all the way with Jesus you've got to and exodus 12:14 says and this day shall be unto you a memorial and you shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your Generations you shall keep it as a feast by an ordinance forever you see this this Monumental event became a memorial a memorial and that Passover feast was to be kept as a celebration through through all generations as an ordinance forever because it showed what did it show it showed the Liberty from bondage amen what is this Blood R represent it shows your Liberty from the bondage of sin amen that's why it's got to be on display you're you don't have true Liberty until you've got God's blood on display in your life you don't even know what true Liberty is you don't even know what freedom is you don't even know what peace is until you've got Living God living down on the inside of your soul when you do you're going to have a peace that passes understanding you're going to have a love that you don't understand you're going to have Fellowship that you didn't even know you could have because it's God's life in you representing himself Hallelujah glory to God don't be ashamed of it saints of God you know this is a time to celebrate it of any other time in history this is a time to celebrate because we've got a word we've got not just a partial part of amen they had a part of the word and then through every age a little bit more and a little bit more but we've got the whole thing we can go we can study the message maybe our our minds can't always grasp every single Doctrine and every single thing but God as you progress in your maturity as you continue to grow God will give you those Revelations that you feel like you're lacking in he's going to grow you in the areas that you feel like you need amen and God is able to do it through this word through the message of this hour glory to God hallelujah don't be ashamed of the word for your day this is life Hallelujah and this Passover feast it was supposed to be a memorial passed down from generation to generation it was a remembrance amen but what you start to see is you through the years as more Generations rose up that that fire dwindled they didn't always keep the feast you know and just to type Our Lives they had ups and downs in the Kingdom they had they had highs and they had lows amen they had a time of prosperity in the word then there was times of restoration you know we see all through the kingdom reign of David and we read about Solomon and the glory of the Lord filling the temple and wow it was just such an incredible thing the glory of the Lord in the temple but then when you come to the time of Josiah the Passover feast had somehow lost it its place in the Kingdom amen the the point of the Celebration The Feast every year so that it was never to be forgotten it was a remembrance it was a Memorial amen but the problem was that even though often times it was celebrated you can watch how it start to lose its spark it was supposed to be a time that the older ones would tell the younger ones all these incredible acts that the Lord had done in their life you know I watched the Red Sea split you know I watch be delivered in all these miraculous ways I watch the woes I watch the plagues come but God delivered me amen and now I'm going to show you that God is a living reality that's what we are to do to our young people that's what we are to do to our kids to show them that God is a living reality he didn't just come in and and have me start dressing differently and acting differently and not going to certain places he came to live on the inside of my soul and now I've got fellowship with a creator that I couldn't even understand before but now I somehow understand it and I can't always explain it but I know it's real hallelujah it's a living reality in your life saints of God Amen it's got to be a living reality it can't be a dead word on a page the letter kill but the spirit giveth life hallelujah it's it's not just going to church it's not just it's not just living right it's so far be beyond that I don't I don't want we can't let the the things of God become common to us amen you know the prophet said every generation has a chance at its own Revival and I believe we as Believers living so close to the end we ought to be zealous for the things of God I want I want my kids to see me have the joy of the of the Holy Ghost I want them to see the power of God in my life I want them to notice how God is molding me and shaping me I want them to notice that maybe dad did wrong but dad's sorry amen I want that I want my wife to know yeah B I messed up and I'm sorry but God's changing me I don't want to be like that anymore I want to be changed from glory to glory amen let the God let God mold your life amen those little things despise not the day of small things God is doing things in your life whether you recognize it or not God is moving in your life every single day amen and it's our duty to keep a flame when we pass that on Amen Joshua inquired of the Lord and he said he said I want this fire rekindled in my in my kingdom I believe that's what every church service is an opportunity to do every day is an opportunity to do to pursue God to study this message you know studying this message is exciting to me you know I believe it should be like that you know when I finish a sermon or a series my my cousin and I were always fellowshipping on what are we going to listen to next what series are we going to go through what year are we going to go through because it's God's word to us you ever wanted to talk to God you go listen to the message of the hour he'll start dealing with you on things in your intricate life you you start you press play on a tape from 1957 and all of a sudden he start dealing with something in your life saints of God I promise it's a living reality to me and I want it to be to you oh glory to God hallelujah that's Hallelujah you know and that by doing those things it shows that you're inquiring of the Lord it shows that you know that that you care what he has to say to you you know and I don't want this to be this doesn't come off as a rebuke but you know if the only time you hear a quote is when you come to church I believe something is wrong and I believe we need to check our life you got to revive the word in your life seek after God and I promise if you don't have that desire seek after God be sincere about it say Lord I want that desire I want that kind of zeal in my life amen and you know what's going to happen next you know it might not be exactly what you think it would be bargained for amen he might start convicting you to purge things in your life he might start convicting you to take those High those high places out amen oh but you know in even in areas that you wouldn't even classify his sin he starts to dig in those things amen he starts to maybe Purge your busy schedules Paul wrote mean all things are expedient but are all I mean all things are lawful but are all things expedient there could be something in your life that may not be unlawful but if it's taking your time away from the Lord Jesus if it's taking away your time from the fellowship with the Creator then get rid of it or ask the Lord maybe to give you Temperance in that thing we need to have Temperance in all things amen glory to God because what's happening is is you're making an idol out of that thing amen and God has set in order a set a series of channels to work through amen and a magnetic tape is one of those channels amen Ministry is one of those channels but Magnetic Tape is also and now we don't have it on Magnetic Tape it's on these fancy things but that's the way the the voice of a prophet to you amen you know and what's so amazing about God and the way that he does things in your life it he will always exceed your thinking on that subject amen the Bible says ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full It also says that God is able to do exceedingly abundantly all that you could ask or think so what happens is as you start putting God first in every facet of your life you're going to start reaping the benefits of that Harvest amen and it might start it might take a little bit of time but God will exceed your expectation amen Josiah started restoring things in the Kingdom He restored Temple worship he burnt the bones of the false prophets and the false priests he tore down those Idol things he kicked out all the sin and God was so pleased with what he did I think we can sometimes Overlook some of these simple things in in scripture but God's word is Rich Amen in the next chapter in verse 18 the Bible says that there was no Passover like that to kept in the days of the uh in Israel from the days of Samuel of the Prophet neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept and the priests and the Levites and all Judah were present and the inhabitants this celebration this Memorial it took on a whole new meaning in the people of Israel amen they had lost their fire for God they forgot about the Deliverance that God had brought them through they remembered not the ways of the Lord but God raised up a man to restore the kingdom Hallelujah and the feast was celebrated like no other time in Israel in Israel's history you know and God doesn't just restore he makes new amen I believe God can renew the joy of your salvation I I believe that your Joys can be full I believe this should be a time of Celebration like never before in history because now more than ever we are closer to the coming of the Lord Jesus it could be tomorrow and every trial that you've ever faced every Temptation every test every tear you've ever cried every Brokenness will be made whole glory to God saints of God don't lose the Zeal of God Amen if you've if you you've never even if you feel like you've never had that kind of of of fervency in your life today is the day of change amen there's no time like the present time don't get so captivated by all the years of ruin that the devil has wre in your life and all the Havoc that he's caused in your life if Josiah would have looked at his undertaking he would have been so discouraged how am I ever going to purge all these things in the kingdom and sometimes we can look in our lives how could I ever change that and then it discourage you and then down the road you get another conviction and then you get discouraged don't look at the past look at what God is going to do in your future amen God can restore God can multiply God can change he can renew the joy of your salvation he can give you the peace and the joy all those things can be in abundance in your life Hallelujah his eyes weren't fixed on what what he could do or or any of those he was it was fixed on what God could do don't focus on what you can do I man I sure can't do a whole lot so I don't focus on what I can do I focus on what God can do amen don't look at your struggles with the wrong lens amen God is able you know sometimes you can look at a if members maybe in your family that it looks just completely helpless or you know all hope seems lost you know God works the best in those cases amen the chapter says I this just to encourage you this morning in 2 Chronicles 352 and he says that he set priests in their charges and encouraged them to the service of the house of the Lord I want this to encourage us this morning whatever your position uh uh in the kingdom of God is you do it with Zeal you take whatever Place God has set for you to do it doesn't doesn't matter there's no big eyes and and little 's in God's kingdom he's looking for men and women to align themselves up with God's word now M no matter how outdated society makes it seem no matter how out of cater with the world it looks we aren't looking to please men and women we the Bible is God's Authority amen not what the modern world says about it we want the word I don't care how unpopular it is I want the truth of God's word amen glory to God Noah Noah kept on preaching it says until the days until the day the doors closed on the ark and you know brother Branda makes that uh argument in that sermon the conflict and he says Noah went in he followed the will for God in his day and God shut the door behind him but it didn't rain for seven days and you know maybe he says in this paragraph 181 of that sermon he says maybe some people the kind of halfway believed Noah might have went up there and stood around the ark and said you know what that old man might have been right we better stand here well then see then they seen a mistake God's prophets makes no mistakes God's word Can't Fail here Noah said now children of all you get around and you'll see the first Cloud that ever come in the sky it'll come over in the morning well the sun come up well maybe 9:00 we'll watch 9:00 10:00 11 o'clock he's watching he's showing the struggle of Noah to to say look we just go to we just got to hold out a little bit longer because God's word says it it's going to come to pass amen there would never been a cloud up here on the earth the prophet said amen but their job wasn't to try to prove some kind of scientific theory their job was to prepare a vessel amen and they listened to God they prepared The Vessel and the culmination of that word from God was not fulfilled until the first raindrop from Heaven came dripping down Hallelujah and the only thing left in our story here now in the culmination of our of our life is for our bodies to be changed amen and I don't know how it's going to happen but I can promise you it's going to happen I don't know how it's going to be but I know it's going to be because God's word says it would be and that's the only thing that we have to look left on Hallelujah that's the only thing left in God's design is for us to take a body change for us to see some maybe a funny feeling P says and and then be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye amen he began preaching that and he said and maybe there was halfway Believers there oh saints of God don't find yourself in that category every person that ever heard the message of Noah even the ones that hated and despised his family and could never just never wrap their minds around you know the Holiness and and standards and but when that rain started falling whether they were in the Ark of Safety or not they believe the message then but it was too late saints of God some of them said well you know what it's Gotta I'm G to agree with sister suie down there brother ROM says this paragraph 184 the big church that old man is crazy he went up there and shut the door and said this rain was going to fall and sets he there and there's nothing to it see Sun come right up when across like that no such thing as rain so then lukewarm halfway Believers half-hearted that's not willing to take God Plum down to the end of the road live or die you see what I mean and then he says stand in your fortified condition live or die sink or drown Hallelujah stay right there just the same saints of God stand in your fortified condition stand in this evil day to stand when you've done all the Bible says when you've done all to stand then stand Hallelujah glory to God don't find yourself in that category a halfway believer halfhearted how sad that would be that you were given an opportunity to see the light of the message of your hour and you only believed it halfway you know people believed that they listened to Moses Noah's message maybe they came even so close to believe in it maybe one day they trickled into his church maybe they started hearing those words maybe they were convicted a little bit but they never went all the way with Jesus they never went all the way with the message and when that rain started falling oh when that rain started falling they were not in the Ark of Safety get in the Ark of Safety today if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you need it if you don't have an experience with God you need it hallelujah hallelujah you stay there until you get it you say I don't know if I got it stay there until you know cuz you're going to know you start having a fellowship that you don't understand you start having communion with the Creator Hallelujah you'll know hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you've got to be just sold out to it Saints you know David's leadership there in 2 Samuel the 23rd chapter he said this was some of the last words the Bible says that were ever spoken by David scripture says this was some of the final days in David's life and just like Joshua's last sermon there to Israel that day David's men had watched the character through his reign as a king through the battles he fought through the way that he conducted himself and they had such a reverence for him and the Bible CS these men Mighty Men they were they were they were they so highly respected David you know that after a battle one day David began just uttering some words it was just a little desire in his heart but these men had so much respect for his word that even as he uttered and he whispered a simple desire these three men had had such high regard for him they risked their lives all he wanted for us was just a drink from The Well of the water of Bethlehem oh and so what did they do they fought their way to they put their lives on the line because of the of the utterance of a desire of their King oh saints of God I want you to notice today that that should be the believer's desire that even if there's an utterance of the word of our Majesty the king even if there's an area in your life that you may not feel like is a compromise if God wants you to give that thing up you give that thing up because that's your desire amen you want some more of God in your life you start giving up things you start just giving God your heart you start making him ruler and reer Hallelujah I want to be like those men that even at the utterance even at the desire spoken of my God even at the message even at the things that seem like it's so hard I want you God to rule Hallelujah Hallelujah that should be the that should be the heart of a Believer his desire outweighs every one of yours amen it should mean that much to us that we should risk Our Lives we could risk our reputation we should risk our relationship we should risk everything for him saints of God it's not just a a God trying to push you into doing something he wants you to make a Rapture he wants you to be in Kingdom with him he wants you to rule and reign with him but he can't do it if you're living in sin he can't do it if you're living in adultery he can't do it if you're living wrong you got to give yourself to God fully hallelujah hallelujah you got to risk your social status you got to risk everything you got to put it all on the line Hallelujah you put his word above your own word glory to God hallelujah you know now in back in the midst of the restoration of the temple there it says that he set in charge leaders and the Bible calls them Workman and they did the work Faithfully it's these men were in charge of individuals that the word calls bearers of burdens now one thing I believe he does it in my life I believe the enemy does in our life is he'll start to he'll start to say you don't matter he'll start to say you're nobody that you've never done a single thing for God oh saints of God it's a lie from the pits of Hell amen God saved you for the end time for a reason amen he saved you to be the last runner in the race for a reason and I believe it's because he knew amen that you would be faithful bearers of this burden amen faithful bearers of this precious word and I believe in my life and in my and in my heart that we are placed into people's lives friends and family children and parents for that reason because you bear the burden of seeing that individual come to Christ and no matter how little you feel God can do great exploits in your life through Warriors of player prayer if you yield yourself to him amen looking for he's looking for believers of his word the greatest talents they mean nothing to God he's looking for believers that won't just take part of his word and that won't shy away from him in the difficult times you know the prophet comes there in the sermon leadership 1965 one of the very last sermons Pastor was talking about on that brother Brenham ever preaches and I thought just how closely it tied in with the last message ever preached by Joshua that day standing there the one that led all of Israel into the promised land I want you to see the contrast this morning they had the same message the same word Joshua said you've got to make your choice Israel you choose this day whom you're going to serve friends the the world offers all kinds of inlets to the word of God but there is only one way to God and that's through Christ Jesus it's through the Passover Lamb it's through the shed blood it's through the word of your day it's through the message of the hour amen the the prophet began contrasting two different lives as we heard Pastor teach on Wednesday and he actually proved by scripture the evidence and the outcomes of those Lifestyles amen the rich man there in the gospels there was a sincere man amen he was a church grow goer and he had come to a Crossroads in his life that he knew that something was missing amen so he came to Jesus seeking that Missing Link and God gave him an answer he said sell out to the world sell out to the idols that hold you back and it never says I noticed this it never says that he quit going to church it never even says that he quit calling himself a Believer but what happened is that he left the word and the evidence of his life was proved by the scriptures that sincerity is not enough you cannot just be sincere you've got to go all the way with Jesus young people I want you to notice this morning that you that the Rich Young Ruler the story of the Rich Young Ruler does it is not some foreign concept you walk in his shoes this morning he had parents that obviously taught him the ways of God because he followed the statutes of God as a Young Man and he came to a Crossroads he maybe he went to church maybe he did all the right things but he never came to a true experience when the word manifested Jesus Christ came to him and showed him the way of Salvation he never was able to go all the way with him and I believe that some could stand here in those same shoes the Rich Young Ruler you're not so far off from his position amen he's that he he was a young man and he came to a Crossroads in his life amen and God said you have to do this this is all you're missing amen oh but he couldn't do it couldn't sell out to the world you could be doing the right thing living the way your parents taught you but there's another step that you've got to take you've got to take it that further than rules and statutes and biblical Concepts it's got to be real to you it's got to be a living reality saints of God you've got to come into complete obedience to his word and I I promise when you're there you'll you'll want to be nowhere else you'll want to be nowhere else glory to God he contrasts Moses and he says you see Moses a faithful servant who esteemed the reproach of Christ came to the same Crossroads in his life could have ruled Egypt but he chose the way of the word and he when he died the Angels picked him up a way to glory and we saw the evidence of it 800 years later at the Mount of Transfiguration amen when he stood there fellowshipping with the one who he allowed lead him amen he was fellowshipping there and we saw the fruition of what the Rich Young Ruler went through he was in Hell tormented by the regions Beyond amen glory to God just some closing comments let's all stand to our feet this morning brother Tony you come and just play something real soft just whatever your heart's choosing is brother brandom says this he says now you're ordained to life you see it if you ordained to see it if you're not ordained to see it you won't see it said they have eyes but they can't see ears and they can't hear how thankful you should be Church how you should straighten yourself up from these things how you should be on fire for God that your eyes behold what you see your ears hears the things that you hear the leadership why did you come at things that you see leadership why did you come here tonight to hear a message like this I'm branded across the world by the churches as a fanatic why did you come the Holy Spirit Led you here to listen cut away the things of the world and accept the leadership of Jesus Christ or you'll perish just as sure as the world he says he says what do you look like what are you following what have we done you must choose your leader choose today you got to choose life your choice will determine your Eternal destination what you choose remember Jesus said follow me and you're invited to do not tonight to do so to follow him to eternal life you must come on his terms amen that's right not upon the word not upon the Creed not upon public opinion not upon what the what anybody else thinks about it but upon what God said about it I believe this morning we prove by the word what God said about it amen I believe we hear every M every uh sermon preach what God says about his word especially lately how he how it's just showing that God God's heart is to show us that there can't be a compromise saints of God there can't be an area of your life where you don't want God to rule that part of your life oh it doesn't matter what it is remember Jesus said follow me get rid of what you got and follow me and the only way to have eternal life that's the only remedy he gave gave this man was the only remedy he gave the businessman it's the only remedy he gives anybody his choice he makes his decision it's perfect every time and we must follow him is the only way to have eternal life he says so the leadership of God is to follow the Vindicated word of the hour which is the holy go by the Holy Ghost amen don't be scared by fancy words the Vindicated word of the hour is the message preached that there's no compromise we don't compromise on the on anything the world says says amen we stand true to What God Says throughout all the ages amen my brother my sister he says to circumcise the things of the world cut away those things what is it that's leading your life amen and if you've never made the choice take the choice of the leadership of the Lord Jesus Christ this morning today is the day of salvation and saints of God I believe many of you have already made that choice I believe there's there's men and women in here that have made the choice to serve God but maybe something said today pricked your heart amen and you want the fire of the word back in your life I believe God can revive that fire in your life I believe God can revive even in a simple service like that with a nobody preacher can revive the fire of God in your life Josiah set his eyes towards God he humbled himself at the hearing of the word and the reading of the law and God did The Impossible in his life he Sanctified the whole Kingdom he reestablished worship maybe something in your life needs some restoration this morning take a stand this morning stand for the word of God ex let the word examine the inward parts of your being the inward parts of your life amen don't fall prey to the modern theory of the devil's lies the modern culture saints of God we serve an unchanging God Hebrews 13 and8 says he is still the same today as he was then and he'll still be the same tomorrow as he was then so we follow the god of then and the god of now and the god of Tomorrow amen we the Lord just kept pressing me on that for this morning if there's Avenues of your life maybe there's a trend in your home even Believers Born Again of the spirit of God maybe there's something starting to take place some rote in your life some habit that you maybe you thought was harmless but it's grown into something that's taking you away from the Lord something that's getting maybe too close to the line of compromise give that thing over to God this morning the Bible says to shun the very appearance of evil and remember that everything is a seed amen even if it seems harmless now so did the words of the serpent to Eve it seemed harmless so did the sacrifice at Cain's altar but you watch it what it led to it led to Eternal separation from God you've already got the evidence taken a stand for the word like Moses did amen and the rich the rich man let's just close our eyes this morning Ephesians 5 says be washed By the Waters of Separation The Waters of the word oh heavenly father I want to declare the words that Joshua declared that day as for me in my house I'm going to serve the Lord Lord and I want to do it this morning I want to do it it with sincerity and with truth Lord I want you to be the one that's leading my life Lord I believe that you can restore anything this morning Father I believe that you can take the ruins of someone Lord God maybe
