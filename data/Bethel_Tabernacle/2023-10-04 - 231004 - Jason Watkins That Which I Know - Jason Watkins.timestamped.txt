[33:16] before me in this generation of every
[33:19] clean Beast Thou shalt take to thee by
[33:22] sevens the male and his female and of
[33:25] beasts that are not clean by to the male
[33:27] and his female of fouls also of the air
[33:31] by sevens the male and the female to
[33:34] keep seed alive upon the face of all the
[33:37] Earth for yet seven days and I will
[33:40] cause it to rain upon the Earth 40 days
[33:42] and 40 nights and every living substance
[33:45] that I have made will I destroy from off
[33:48] the face of the Earth and Noah did
[33:50] according to unto all that the Lord
[33:52] commanded him and Noah was 600 years old
[33:56] when the the flood of waters was upon
[33:58] the Earth and Noah went in and his sons
[34:02] and his wife and his sons wives with him
[34:05] into the ark because of the Waters of
[34:08] the
[34:09] flood of clean beasts and of beasts that

[34:43] month the 17th day of the month the same
[34:47] day were all The Fountains of the great
[34:50] deep broken up and the windows of Heaven
[34:53] were open and there's more and the rain
[34:57] was upon the Earth 40 days and 40 nights

[35:05] japheth the sons of Noah and Noah's
[35:07] wives and the three wives of his sons
[35:09] with them into the ark just making sure
[35:10] you're not missing the details right
[35:14] they and every Beast of after his kind
[35:17] and all the cattle after their kind and
[35:19] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[35:20] the Earth after his kind and every foul
[35:22] of the air uh after his kind and every
[35:24] bird of every sort
[35:27] and they went in unto Noah into the ark
[35:29] two and two of all the flesh wherein is
[35:32] the breath of life and they went in went
[35:37] in male and female and All Flesh as God
[35:40] had commanded him and the Lord shut him
[35:44] in but wait there's more and the flood
[35:48] was 40 days upon the earth and the
[35:49] waters increased and bore up uh the ark
[35:53] and it was lifted up above the earth and
[35:56] the Waters prevailed and were increased
[35:59] greatly upon the earth and the Ark went
[36:02] upon the face of the waters and the
[36:05] waters prevailed exceedingly upon the
[36:07] Earth and all the hills that were under
[36:09] the whole Heaven were covered 15 22 feet
[36:14] above the highest mountain peak see 15
[36:19] cubits upward did the waters Prevail and
[36:22] the mountains were
[36:25] covered
[36:27] that's a lot let's pray father we thank
[36:32] you for your word thank you for this
[36:34] time to be gathered together we ask for
[36:37] your very coveted anointing Lord to be
[36:40] upon it be upon speaker and hearer
[36:42] commit ourselves into your hands in
[36:44] Jesus name amen God bless you friends
[36:46] you can be
[36:54] seated you say that's quite a bit of
[36:56] detail
[36:59] there are few places in the Bible that
[37:04] take such pains to give such detail
[37:08] about everything almost to the point of
[37:12] redundancy to where it's just repeating
[37:15] it over and over and every time it
[37:17] repeats it it hangs on to all the
[37:20] details you know it's not just the male
[37:23] and the female and then later and all
[37:25] those animals got on no it's stops again
[37:27] to say no it was the female the male the
[37:29] female it was every creeping thing and
[37:32] it was all the fowls and it was this and
[37:34] then the water and then it rained and
[37:36] then it Rose well then it rained harder
[37:38] and it Rose more and then it rained
[37:39] harder and it Rose more and it Rose and
[37:41] Rose and Rose and Rose till it covered
[37:43] everything even the highest tippy top
[37:45] Mountain amen and everything perished
[37:48] that God had created on the face of the
[37:50] Earth there are a few doctrines it is
[37:54] said in Scripture
[37:57] um few doctrines in scripture are as
[38:01] clearly
[38:03] taught as the global nature of the great
[38:07] flood of Noah's day I'll say that again
[38:11] I thought it was a profound statement
[38:13] few doctrines in scripture are as
[38:17] clearly taught as the global nature of
[38:20] the great flood in Noah's
[38:23] day the precise measurement I I was
[38:27] thinking about this and I just started
[38:28] jotting things down the precise
[38:33] measurements the the details concerning
[38:37] the
[38:38] plan the
[38:41] purpose the
[38:43] cargo the purpose in building it the per
[38:46] why they needed it who authorized it who
[38:50] the builders were how long it took every
[38:54] detail laid out the
[38:57] clarity from God to
[39:00] Moses in recording the events of This
[39:05] Global flood of Noah's
[39:07] day I would say is one of the most
[39:10] detailed set of plans and specs I have
[39:13] personally ever
[39:15] witnessed and I've seen a lot of plans
[39:17] and specs uh in my day I mean think
[39:21] about this Ken Ham built a scaled
[39:25] replica
[39:27] to scale 500 almost 600 and however many
[39:30] feet long and 50 and high and however
[39:33] wide I forget the exact dimensions it's
[39:35] one of it literally he built it up in
[39:38] Kentucky and he the whole thing is built
[39:42] off of 4,000 year old
[39:45] text in the
[39:49] Bible brother brandham comes into
[39:54] 1959 and he comes to a message message
[39:56] that he preaches three times I believe
[39:59] all in 1959 at various places he
[40:02] preaches it the very first time in
[40:05] Jeffersonville be certain of God now I'm
[40:09] preaching tonight on that which I know
[40:12] and I'm and and and this is the real
[40:15] burden of my heart because before I
[40:17] start on this quote let me just say
[40:20] this H having said everything I just
[40:23] said about the ark and the flood and all
[40:27] the plans and all the details and
[40:30] there's hardly anything any story
[40:33] anywhere in the Bible I mean you you'd
[40:36] have to go into Ezekiel describing the
[40:39] temple maybe that would maybe run at a
[40:41] close second maybe John describing the
[40:44] new city and some different things that
[40:45] he saw but but but yet here it is one of
[40:49] the most detailed intricate take your
[40:53] time Moses and write it out in clear
[40:56] terms and just keep writing and I want
[40:59] it thoroughly covered and so much so
[41:02] that there are few doctrines so covered
[41:04] and yet that is one of the most debated
[41:11] doubted teachings in the Bible it's one
[41:14] of the first things that
[41:17] Scholars
[41:18] attack and in fact is it when you know
[41:21] during the the days of exploration of
[41:24] the of the British Empire you know when
[41:27] they came across the Himalayan Mountains
[41:30] it caused such
[41:32] controversy among the theologians of
[41:35] England that they actually begin to say
[41:38] you know Noah's the tale of Noah's Ark
[41:41] cannot be true maybe there was a flood
[41:43] and maybe there was an ark but Global
[41:46] Extinction covering the Himalayas uh-uh
[41:49] didn't
[41:51] happen and I mean that that is to the
[41:53] extent and then they had to then some of
[41:55] the real fire Brands you know came on
[41:58] the scene and said well you know maybe
[42:00] maybe the flood made the Himalayas did
[42:03] you ever think of that and and there's a
[42:05] big debate over it and they even you
[42:07] know the archaeologists or Christian
[42:10] archaeologists think they can prove that
[42:11] by evidence I don't
[42:13] care I I just know what
[42:16] happened there's no doubt in my mind I
[42:19] mean I know that God got tired of the
[42:22] sin and he
[42:25] recycled
[42:26] that's what I
[42:27] know I don't know if the himalayans were
[42:30] C here's what I know there was a Noah
[42:32] and there was a flood and God was done
[42:35] and he wiped everything out that's what
[42:37] I know I know eight Souls got on I know
[42:40] eight Souls got off I know that he was a
[42:42] prophet of God I know he had three sons
[42:44] and I know their
[42:45] names that's what I
[42:48] know it's important to know things
[42:53] especially about
[42:55] God one of the most devastating things
[42:58] that you can do to yourself in self harm
[43:02] is to doubt one word of God's
[43:05] Bible you will do more self harm to
[43:08] yourself in that way and have no one to
[43:10] blame but yourself by doubting one iota
[43:14] of this book
[43:17] Amen brother brandham says and be
[43:19] certain of God now I I want you to catch
[43:21] something here and I'm just going to go
[43:23] ahead and and and and give it to you
[43:26] so you'll catch it right from the
[43:28] beginning you won't wait for the
[43:31] punchline of course we know that the
[43:33] days of Noah are one of the prophetic
[43:36] signs that we are to look for to
[43:38] indicate that the end is near we had the
[43:42] days of Noah and the days of lot and no
[43:45] age had to take them both on except this
[43:48] age and so so so so now when we think
[43:52] about how that this is one of the
[43:55] parallel for us personally then you
[43:58] should be able to go back into the story
[44:02] and find parallels you know that that
[44:05] look like today and you can and you do
[44:10] you find where brother brandham you know
[44:12] comes up how that you know he he in this
[44:15] message he took a text about when Elijah
[44:20] went to the Widow of zarap and how that
[44:23] you know he had resisted Jezebel and and
[44:26] you get Ahab on the throne and you get
[44:28] Jezebel and brother Brenham just starts
[44:29] correlating those with the modern day
[44:32] and says we had a a modern Ahab in the
[44:34] White House and a jezebel system that
[44:37] was behind it right so he he I didn't
[44:40] take that text that he chose here
[44:43] because I I I I had to choose one of the
[44:45] two and I wanted to start with Noah
[44:46] because I'm coming winding uh going to
[44:48] circle back around to it but brother
[44:50] brandham says here for we do not come to
[44:53] the house of the Lord to be seen he's in
[44:55] a prayer now this is important he says
[44:58] we do not come to the house of the Lord
[45:00] to be
[45:02] seen or to
[45:05] see I didn't come to see you you didn't
[45:08] come to see me he says we came to learn
[45:11] he's talking to God in a prayer Lord we
[45:14] came to learn Of Thee I didn't come to
[45:17] see these people they didn't come to see
[45:19] me Lord I came here tonight to learn of
[45:24] thee and to and not just that that's a
[45:27] pretty broad statement but he's going to
[45:29] break it down to learn of thee and to
[45:33] Know Thy
[45:36] nature thy
[45:38] way and thy
[45:40] causes that we might be able Oh you mean
[45:44] there's a there's a purpose behind all
[45:46] yes there's a purpose for you to know
[45:48] his nature there's a purpose for you to
[45:51] know his ways there's a purpose in you
[45:53] knowing his causes there's a purpose for
[45:56] you to learn from him that we might be
[45:59] able to face the problems of Life how
[46:04] many want that with a real
[46:08] Assurance being certain of God and and
[46:12] this is so such a statement that he
[46:15] doesn't even suggest that you have to
[46:19] understand everything about your life or
[46:21] that you have to be certain about
[46:23] everything that you face all you need to
[46:25] do is be certain of
[46:28] God understand his nature learn his ways
[46:33] come here to learn from him and then
[46:36] whatever you face you can be
[46:40] certain because you're certain of
[46:44] God with real Assurance the difference
[46:48] in assurance and real Assurance
[46:49] Assurance is sometimes people tries to
[46:52] boost you up you know and uh it's all
[46:54] kinds of psychological tricks that
[46:56] people can use to try to encourage
[46:58] somebody I'm not speaking good or bad
[47:00] about it it's always good to try to
[47:02] encourage somebody but we're going
[47:04] Beyond just human encouragement I'm
[47:06] talking about do you have
[47:09] Supernatural Faith do you have
[47:12] Supernatural certainty that no matter
[47:15] what you're facing right now or tomorrow
[47:17] you can say whatever it is I don't know
[47:19] but I I'll know God a little more having
[47:22] been in this service
[47:24] tonight
[47:26] brother brandham goes into real life I
[47:27] love how he dramatizes here comes Elijah
[47:30] it must have been a dreadful morning now
[47:32] don't forget because we're correlating
[47:35] to our day brother brandham uses Elijah
[47:37] here also not just Noah not just lot but
[47:40] Elijah dealing with an Ahab and a
[47:41] jezebel and a widow of zerath and the
[47:44] situation on the ground at Ground Zero
[47:47] see it must have been a dreadful morning
[47:50] he's on his way now it was so hot and
[47:54] Dusty and people was in the street
[47:57] starving and the Earth was so hot it was
[48:00] ready to burn I just thought to myself
[48:03] goodness gracious is he talking about
[48:06] some Modern Cosmopolitan City or is he
[48:09] talking about back in the Bible because
[48:10] this sounds to me like you've got an
[48:12] earth that's just so hot and so dry and
[48:16] people in the streets starving and it
[48:18] just looks like the whole world's about
[48:20] to burn
[48:22] down you see Ahab was reigning in Israel
[48:25] at that time and over Israel and he was
[48:28] the wickedest of all the kings of Israel
[48:30] there had never been no King as wicked
[48:32] as Ahab see for for he being taught and
[48:35] know better that's what made it so bad
[48:38] because this is the age of extreme
[48:42] hypocrisy this is the age of blind
[48:44] hypocrisy where people are such
[48:47] Hypocrites they forget they are and go
[48:50] to claim God make a claim on God hey we
[48:53] deserve eternal life can you imagine
[48:55] being so hypocritical that you forget
[48:57] you're a hypocrite and stand in the face
[48:59] of God and say you need to give me
[49:01] eternal
[49:02] life I mean you talk I mean somebody
[49:05] about to have a sunstroke I mean I can't
[49:07] believe that people can get to that and
[49:10] it's not a person here in there it's
[49:14] Global the the book of the The Book of
[49:17] Revelation says the sea gave up its dead
[49:19] and the dead both small and great stood
[49:22] before him on the throne the heavens
[49:23] peeled back and the books are open and
[49:25] another book is open and here comes all
[49:27] of these billions and billions of people
[49:30] and they're they're astonished that they
[49:32] don't get to go to heaven
[49:36] amen that's The Madness of the last
[49:40] day I heard a a Christian guy trying to
[49:44] witness to a very ill-famed young woman
[49:47] who had who had given her body over to
[49:50] terrible things that she was admitting
[49:52] to he's trying to witness to her and
[49:55] she's at admitting you know to things
[49:57] that she does on the internet and and
[49:59] he's asking her you know do you not
[50:01] think about someday if you have children
[50:03] and if they see some of that stuff and
[50:06] and she says I'll have you know I'm a
[50:08] Christian just as much as you are and I
[50:11] have accepted Jesus Christ for my sins
[50:13] just like you and this young woman being
[50:17] nothing more than just than just a a
[50:21] was
[50:24] 110% right in the camera 100 and looked
[50:27] that young man right in the face and
[50:28] said I'll be in heaven for
[50:32] sure this is how
[50:34] insane hypocrisy has
[50:38] become what's caused it
[50:40] Ahab we've got the worst evil in our
[50:45] leadership not just in this country in
[50:48] the world everything you're dealing with
[50:51] is the worst everything you're dealing
[50:53] with is as bad as it's ever been been
[50:56] and as bad as it'll ever be and it's not
[50:58] going to get better or turn around it's
[51:00] only getting worse until say how bad
[51:02] will it get until it moves out into
[51:05] complete self Annihilation God is not
[51:08] going to destroy the world or the people
[51:12] he's going to take the bride home and
[51:14] allow the people to destroy
[51:18] themselves nobody on the day of judgment
[51:20] is going to impune god with Injustice or
[51:23] unfairness amen
[51:26] what was the problem Ahab was on the
[51:28] throne the worst most evil king of all
[51:30] God and every he he continued to disle
[51:33] God he knew better he's the ultimate
[51:37] Authority hypocrite he knew better he
[51:41] failed uh not to he didn't continue to
[51:45] you know he he continued to displease
[51:47] God and everything did although he had a
[51:48] great military system now are we here in
[51:51] America we got a great military system
[51:54] and the people has become very
[51:56] prosperous under his Reign but you
[51:59] cannot displease God and expect to get
[52:01] by very
[52:02] long and then in his wedding instead of
[52:06] marrying among his own people he went
[52:08] over and married a sinner an idolator a
[52:11] worship of Idols he married Jezebel and
[52:14] she was not a Believer and and you you
[52:16] realize that Ahab was in the lineage of
[52:20] Abraham so he's supposed to be a a
[52:23] leader like David he's supposed to
[52:25] represent the word of God he's supposed
[52:28] to represent the law of Moses but you
[52:30] see this is what this is what's
[52:33] happening in the very day and hour that
[52:34] we live in you have a church marrying
[52:37] with the world and still claiming
[52:40] they're the church and brother Brandon
[52:43] just just said this is insanity and the
[52:46] more he proved it in the Bible and the
[52:48] more God demonstrated it in the
[52:50] Supernatural the more they closed the
[52:53] doors on him amen amen tell me that's
[52:56] same
[52:58] thinking no believer should ever marry
[53:00] an unbeliever under no circumstances
[53:02] should always marry Believers see Ahab
[53:05] done this evil thing so so I want to
[53:08] really just just before I jump off of
[53:11] this quote I really want you to
[53:13] understand Ahab done this evil thing so
[53:18] it is it is a it is a dreadful well now
[53:23] we're with the we're at Ahab we're at
[53:25] Jezebel we're at Elijah we're at the
[53:27] zerath Widow so we're at the end time
[53:29] events end time sequence of events amen
[53:33] that's a parallel to where we're at so
[53:36] in the parallel of where we're at one of
[53:39] the worst evils things that can happen
[53:43] is for somebody to claim to be a
[53:46] believer right amen but intermingled
[53:51] with the world making the claim that
[53:53] they're a believer Amen to to call
[53:57] yourself a Christian but to be mingled
[54:01] with the world makes your claim
[54:07] blasphemy it can't get worse you see why
[54:10] we say that we're not of that we don't
[54:13] want to be a part of that we are a
[54:15] separate called out very distinctly
[54:18] different
[54:19] people we have different standards and
[54:22] very proud to have them we don't not
[54:25] oldfashioned there's no old word we're
[54:30] original
[54:32] Hallelujah he marries
[54:34] Jezebel that's that's so many people
[54:37] make the same mistake
[54:38] today Jezebel was a beautiful woman and
[54:41] he fell for what she looked like instead
[54:44] of what she was well that's a
[54:46] tragedy imagine that you married someone
[54:49] for what they look like instead of what
[54:51] they were and you found out that what
[54:54] they were
[54:56] after you married him amen the devil
[54:59] does that teenagers he does that he'll
[55:01] attract you with worldly pleasures and
[55:03] Beauty but he doesn't show you what he
[55:06] really is he's an evil Wicked
[55:09] underhanded stinking liar bent on your
[55:14] destruction don't fall for
[55:18] it she had brought idolatry into the
[55:21] nation has that has it happened friends
[55:23] among the people and the people listen
[55:25] to this the people the priest their
[55:27] ministers all of them they had fell
[55:31] victim oh my they had fell victim to
[55:36] this great popular
[55:39] demand and brother Brandon now if you if
[55:41] you think I'm I'm using you know no no
[55:45] authority to correlate that to this day
[55:48] here's brother brandham and it's the
[55:50] very picture of our
[55:53] country today amen we have fallen under
[55:59] the popular
[56:01] demand friends I I am so averse to the
[56:07] popular demand of this world I am so
[56:11] averse that we would have any semblance
[56:14] any resemblance any notion any Shadow I
[56:18] don't want us to look anything like them
[56:22] I don't want us to act anything like
[56:24] them I don't want you to believe like
[56:26] them I don't want you to think like them
[56:29] I don't want you to react like them we
[56:31] are believers we are sons of the king
[56:35] and we are a chosen
[56:39] generation no doubt that the priest
[56:42] thought it would be all right as long as
[56:44] their government okay it wow we see that
[56:48] happening in churches today I guess it's
[56:50] okay the government said and the Supreme
[56:52] Court said and the president said so I
[56:54] guess we're going to going to have to
[56:55] say too so now here in this correlation
[56:59] story that correlates to our day we have
[57:03] the church and the state perfectly in
[57:07] harmony to do what now we're back in
[57:09] Israel all right you've got the church
[57:12] he said you know the ministers the
[57:14] priest the people everything is going
[57:18] along with the government are all are
[57:20] all holding
[57:21] hands so here we have the church and the
[57:24] State perfectly in harmony to do what to
[57:28] meet the sinful demands of the people
[57:33] amen I mean I mean after all you know
[57:36] it's it's government of the people it's
[57:40] for the people it's by the people and
[57:43] you know I mean although that governing
[57:46] a nation you know as a constitutional
[57:49] republic was not completely novel in
[57:52] 1777 actually Aristotle writes about it
[57:55] in his work on politics but but for the
[57:58] American colonies and our founding
[58:00] fathers what made it unique was what
[58:03] made it an experiment was that it was
[58:06] being envisioned on a much larger scale
[58:09] than had ever thought anyone ever
[58:12] thought could be the irony is that this
[58:16] experimental government of the people
[58:20] was both the greatest strength of the
[58:23] people and simultaneously their greatest
[58:27] vulnerability amen
[58:30] see and Satan knew
[58:33] it and Satan knew
[58:36] it Americans would live under
[58:40] God's unique blessing I mean it's the
[58:43] only way you can account for it if you
[58:45] go back and study the history why should
[58:46] we have suddenly just leaped ahead of
[58:49] the whole world we barely survived a
[58:51] revolution and then we almost then we
[58:53] had to fight him again and then we had a
[58:55] civil war that should have took us to to
[58:57] powder and and and and then we took some
[59:00] land and bought some made a few deals
[59:02] and grew a Navy that and an army and
[59:04] then the next thing you know we're
[59:06] called into World War I and then
[59:07] suddenly this little fledgling country's
[59:10] a
[59:11] superpower and then we're starting to
[59:13] move and Shake in the world and we've
[59:15] got you know we've got battleships we're
[59:17] building and the next thing you know the
[59:19] whole world is looking to us to rescue
[59:21] them in World War II and then we come
[59:23] from there and now we're the the glor
[59:24] super strength and the the financial
[59:28] part of it and technology and Industry
[59:31] and and then this is what Yamamoto knew
[59:33] he said you know I can hold them off
[59:35] they're a sleeping giant I I went to
[59:37] school there I I think he went to Yale
[59:39] and and he said I I know the American
[59:41] people said you you better wipe them out
[59:43] quick you better get them while they're
[59:45] asleep because if you let them wake up
[59:46] that' be it and that's what happened at
[59:49] Pearl Harbor they didn't finish the job
[59:51] and we retooled and we rebuilt and then
[59:54] we became a behemoth and and there was
[59:56] no way that we could build ships faster
[59:59] than they could sink
[1:00:01] them and so so we we find that that
[1:00:06] America would live under God's very
[1:00:08] unique blessing for about 180 years all
[1:00:11] the way from 1777 all the way up to
[1:00:15] 1957 when brother brandham said now the
[1:00:17] nation has turned God down for the last
[1:00:19] time yeah and from here she'll go worse
[1:00:22] and worse into judgment and she had
[1:00:25] but for 180 years she enjoys his unique
[1:00:28] blessing you have multiple purposes one
[1:00:31] it would be the purpose of having a land
[1:00:33] to the furtherest extreme west of the
[1:00:36] Western Hemisphere itself just so that
[1:00:39] prophecy could be fulfilled concerning
[1:00:41] the age as the lightning shineth from
[1:00:43] the East even unto the West so shall it
[1:00:46] be at the coming of the son of man you
[1:00:48] had uh you had to have a nation where
[1:00:50] the message of the hour you had to have
[1:00:52] a nation that had position and wealth
[1:00:55] and influence because this is going to
[1:00:58] have to be not just a restoration of the
[1:01:01] entire original message but now it's not
[1:01:03] just going to be you know and Paul's
[1:01:06] travels up through turkey and you know
[1:01:08] Thomas over in India a little bit here
[1:01:10] and you've got other ones down here and
[1:01:11] going there but this thing's going to
[1:01:13] have to go
[1:01:14] Global it it's going to H we're we're in
[1:01:17] an age now where you got world
[1:01:19] wars it's not just Nation Rise Against
[1:01:22] Nation It's All Nations Against All
[1:01:25] Nations and now the gospel is going to
[1:01:27] have to go Global it's going to have to
[1:01:29] be on the farthest Western Hemisphere
[1:01:32] nothing is an
[1:01:36] accident so the message of the hours got
[1:01:38] to be sent around the world effectively
[1:01:41] the nation I mean if you just go look at
[1:01:43] the nation spoken of in Revelation 13 as
[1:01:47] you can see that it's America and you
[1:01:48] can see that it's going to be the
[1:01:50] world's greatest power both financially
[1:01:53] scientifically
[1:01:55] militarily I mean it's it it's it's that
[1:01:58] nation of Revelation 13 that has the
[1:02:02] financial and Military and technological
[1:02:06] ability to force the whole world to
[1:02:09] worship the Beast
[1:02:12] amen amen go read Revelation
[1:02:15] 13 this it's this nation in cahoots with
[1:02:20] with with the tree of knowledge of Good
[1:02:22] and Evil In Cahoots with the beast in
[1:02:23] cahoots with the Antichrist that calls
[1:02:26] fire down from
[1:02:29] heaven we're not talking the future
[1:02:31] we're talking what happened over over
[1:02:33] hirosima and Nagasaki that that was
[1:02:36] nuclear
[1:02:37] bombs those were that that was Genesis
[1:02:41] Power
[1:02:42] released that was creative power but man
[1:02:45] don't have to control it and it
[1:02:47] destroyed but but brother Brenham ties
[1:02:50] hirosima and Nagasaki right into
[1:02:53] Revelation 13 that they have power to
[1:02:55] call fire down out of heaven so that the
[1:02:57] whole world goes oh we better listen to
[1:03:00] them see you think this is an accident
[1:03:04] none of it's an accident
[1:03:06] amen it's all running at the pace of
[1:03:10] Prophecy see and and and because of all
[1:03:13] of
[1:03:15] that because of the financial strength
[1:03:18] the scientific technological strength
[1:03:21] the military strength the industrial
[1:03:23] might because of all of that then we
[1:03:26] have the super political power to force
[1:03:30] the world I mean don't forget that that
[1:03:33] that the Antichrist system brings the
[1:03:36] world to heal not because of nukes but
[1:03:39] because of
[1:03:40] dollars and
[1:03:42] gold you understand the wealth of the
[1:03:45] world they'll they'll take over by Craft
[1:03:47] they will they will exercise Authority
[1:03:50] because of the
[1:03:51] finances this is all prophecy we're not
[1:03:54] making this up this is prophecy none of
[1:03:56] this is
[1:03:59] accidental
[1:04:01] see so you you know you can you can go
[1:04:04] all you can you could stay up here till
[1:04:06] the cows come home and talk about all
[1:04:09] the all the the conspiracies of the
[1:04:12] Roth's Childs and this group and the
[1:04:15] Illuminati and all of that you say Do
[1:04:17] you believe in any of that stuff I
[1:04:18] believe in all them Devils oh yeah I
[1:04:21] also believe that they're all being
[1:04:23] controlled by prophecy
[1:04:24] I don't care who met what wear in Hilton
[1:04:27] Head or Martha's Vineyard I couldn't
[1:04:28] care less I know who I
[1:04:32] met Hallelujah I know who's in
[1:04:36] control I don't worry about a secret
[1:04:39] room or a secret handshake or closed
[1:04:41] doors it doesn't matter they don't
[1:04:43] matter only this matters that's what I
[1:04:48] know I don't know if all these
[1:04:50] conspiracies are true but here's what I
[1:04:53] know amen
[1:04:57] see it literally this nation was
[1:05:01] prophesied to be rich and increased with
[1:05:05] Goods not just this nation but the
[1:05:06] church not just this church but the
[1:05:08] spirit on the age would be that we are
[1:05:11] increased with Goods that was a Telltale
[1:05:15] sign a nation that was increased with
[1:05:18] Goods who didn't really deserve to
[1:05:22] be a nation
[1:05:24] who who has some of the darkest stains
[1:05:28] upon its
[1:05:29] history and nobody wants to talk about
[1:05:31] it say oh yeah I mean if you talk one
[1:05:34] thing then the left is mad if you go to
[1:05:36] this side and then the right is mad and
[1:05:39] I'm just telling the
[1:05:41] truth
[1:05:43] amen so I mean you definitely there's no
[1:05:47] there's nothing about this nation today
[1:05:49] that it should be you know it should be
[1:05:52] allowed to be the Great great world
[1:05:54] power it is because God has allowed it
[1:05:58] because Satan has made it that according
[1:06:01] to this Satan has made it that way and
[1:06:05] this nation has went along with it well
[1:06:09] there's some people here who don't go
[1:06:11] along with
[1:06:14] it I know I can't change it and I'm not
[1:06:17] worried about changing it I'm worried
[1:06:18] about leaving
[1:06:22] itlu she was prophesy decid to be rich
[1:06:24] and increased with Goods however another
[1:06:28] Telltale sign is that she would be woy
[1:06:31] woefully terribly horribly
[1:06:35] irreparably
[1:06:37] backslidden that's prophecy I don't care
[1:06:40] what the nation thinks of themselves if
[1:06:42] they say man we are a superpower then
[1:06:44] that tells me you're backsliding we got
[1:06:47] all the finances all the military yeah
[1:06:49] this goes with this if you've got this
[1:06:51] then you've got this see so you're
[1:06:55] you're you're and it's not just woefully
[1:06:57] backslid and you finally according to
[1:07:00] the prophecy go beyond redemption or you
[1:07:02] can't even be saved or it won't even
[1:07:03] matter what you do right see all satan
[1:07:09] had to do once he got a
[1:07:12] government of the people for the people
[1:07:16] of the PE by the people of the people
[1:07:18] and for the people then all he had to do
[1:07:22] was gradually over time pervert the
[1:07:26] hearts of the people with excess
[1:07:30] sin because it's a government of the
[1:07:32] people so all he's got to do is pervert
[1:07:35] the people over time how does he do that
[1:07:38] he breaks the backbone destroys
[1:07:41] motherhood brings World War I and women
[1:07:44] go into the workforce and then then the
[1:07:46] whole thing is no way to get the genie
[1:07:48] back in the
[1:07:49] bottle see he goes into the pull pits
[1:07:52] and perverts all the pull pits yeah and
[1:07:55] then he and then then there then the
[1:07:57] politics didn't stand a chance they
[1:07:58] never they were e they were corrupt
[1:08:00] already even in when Godly men were in
[1:08:03] there you still had politics and it's
[1:08:04] Evil By Nature because it's men you know
[1:08:07] ruling over men and so so you've got
[1:08:10] Fallen men with Fallen hearts and
[1:08:12] perverted Notions and so so so the sin
[1:08:15] would eventually in fact
[1:08:20] his Satan was so successful at ping this
[1:08:24] off we didn't get here by accident that
[1:08:27] he would eventually eclip eclipse the
[1:08:31] sin of all the other much older
[1:08:36] Nations much older Europe is much older
[1:08:40] Asia's even much older the the Middle
[1:08:43] East much older you know but but when
[1:08:46] you come here to the Western Hemisphere
[1:08:48] and you've got a relatively young
[1:08:50] fledgling Nation what are we 250
[1:08:53] whatever year I haven't did the math in
[1:08:54] a while and counted it up but but I mean
[1:08:57] you know 1776 to now we're just a baby
[1:09:01] and we're already the most evil oh yeah
[1:09:04] already the most sinful most powerful
[1:09:07] richest military of science technology
[1:09:09] yeah sinful on your way to Hell getting
[1:09:12] ready to be
[1:09:13] destroyed you're you're literally
[1:09:15] becoming the the the right hand of the
[1:09:18] Beast system by
[1:09:20] Design don't believe it but it's design
[1:09:23] yes amen see they don't believe the ark
[1:09:26] though it's so clear they don't believe
[1:09:28] what happened in Noah's day but it's so
[1:09:30] detailed you think Moses made all that
[1:09:33] up you think John just just like like
[1:09:35] that man who talked to brother brandom
[1:09:37] said John must have ate a hot pepper
[1:09:39] that night and brother R said aren't you
[1:09:41] ashamed of yourself to think such a
[1:09:43] thing first of all this was our brother
[1:09:45] in Christ who suffered you don't make
[1:09:48] light of it this was sincere he wrot he
[1:09:50] only wrote what he saw and what he
[1:09:52] heard
[1:09:54] see he paid such a high price to do it
[1:09:57] you're going to doubt it and Scorn at it
[1:10:00] so the sin would eventually Eclipse all
[1:10:02] other even much older Nations and
[1:10:04] brother bramman fact is would comment
[1:10:07] how that the world and this is
[1:10:08] historically accurate how that the world
[1:10:11] formerly had always needed to go to the
[1:10:13] old European cities we we used he say we
[1:10:17] used to have to go to Paris right and
[1:10:21] import our filth
[1:10:24] we had to go to these Fallen ancient
[1:10:27] cities because we didn't have that it
[1:10:31] wasn't in our wasn't in our nucleus it
[1:10:33] wasn't in our structure it wasn't in our
[1:10:35] society but we wanted
[1:10:37] it we wanted it so we went there and
[1:10:40] imported it into this country and
[1:10:43] brother bradam picks it up now and he
[1:10:45] says now he says you know how that that
[1:10:49] that with Satan gradually over time he's
[1:10:52] perverting the heart of the people
[1:10:54] whereas we forly would have to go to
[1:10:56] Paris to get its filth but once
[1:11:00] Hollywood became the
[1:11:02] established Center of entertainment for
[1:11:06] the world that is a historical happening
[1:11:10] that you can track in history there was
[1:11:12] a time when it wasn't and then a time
[1:11:14] when it is and then a time when it's go
[1:11:17] it's Global dominance and now it's it's
[1:11:19] everything and they've got all kinds of
[1:11:21] other ones and I'm not not here to say
[1:11:23] you know
[1:11:24] you got Bollywood and you got all these
[1:11:25] other different now you got all kinds of
[1:11:27] different Productions but I'm just
[1:11:28] saying Hollywood in
[1:11:32] general brother brandham then would
[1:11:34] begin to
[1:11:35] say how that while there had been a time
[1:11:39] where we would have to go to Paris to
[1:11:41] get their filth and bring it back here
[1:11:43] but now that we have Hollywood Paris and
[1:11:47] all the world with them come
[1:11:50] here to get it see so a
[1:11:55] America uh you know more specifically
[1:11:59] the Greater Los Angeles area and
[1:12:03] Hollywood you know I I I I'm building
[1:12:07] some stuff for Sunday but I I'll
[1:12:10] probably say this again I'll show you a
[1:12:12] graph on the screen but let me just tip
[1:12:13] you off right now no I'm not I'm Gonna
[1:12:16] Save
[1:12:19] it I didn't do that on purpose
[1:12:22] but
[1:12:24] make sure you come back to church
[1:12:28] Sunday the Greater Los Angeles and
[1:12:31] Hollywood area would literally become an
[1:12:33] exporter of
[1:12:35] sin not an importer now an exporter at
[1:12:39] unprecedented historic levels all over
[1:12:43] the world the the most unparalleled
[1:12:45] levels in history you see I mean if you
[1:12:48] think about it God never anointed Elijah
[1:12:53] to say that God thus sayith the Lord God
[1:12:57] will sink Paris Beneath the
[1:13:01] Sea he didn't say that he didn't say he
[1:13:04] will sink London Beneath the Sea what he
[1:13:06] said was God will sink
[1:13:10] Hollywood beneath the
[1:13:12] ocean he'll sink her see and and and
[1:13:17] instead you know he's going to not sink
[1:13:19] Paris he's going to sink Hollywood and
[1:13:21] then from there a fifth
[1:13:24] 1500 mile long by
[1:13:27] 350 mile wide chunk of the US West Coast
[1:13:33] will slide beneath the waves a mile
[1:13:38] deep
[1:13:40] amen Journey with me back to 1965
[1:13:43] brother brandham just before he goes
[1:13:45] home in the choosing of a
[1:13:52] bride
[1:13:58] [Music]
[1:14:03] to this day and Sodom gomorah lays in
[1:14:06] the bottom of the Dead Sea and capernium
[1:14:07] is in the bottom of the sea thou City
[1:14:12] who claims to be the city of the
[1:14:14] Angels who's exalted yourself into
[1:14:17] heaven and sent all the dirty filthy
[1:14:20] things of Fashions and things to even
[1:14:22] the foreign countries here to pick up
[1:14:24] our filth and send it away your fine
[1:14:27] churches and Steeples and so forth the
[1:14:29] way you do remember one
[1:14:32] day you will be laying in the bottom of
[1:14:35] the sea your great honey core under you
[1:14:39] right now the wrath of God is belching
[1:14:42] right beneath you how much longer you'll
[1:14:44] hold this Sandbar hanging over that on
[1:14:47] that ocean out under a mile deep will
[1:14:48] slide in there pump back to the salt and
[1:14:52] sea
[1:14:54] it'll be worse than the last day of
[1:14:57] Pompei repent Los
[1:15:00] Angeles repent the rest of you and turn
[1:15:03] to God the hour of his wrath is upon the
[1:15:05] Earth flee while there's time to flee
[1:15:08] and come into
[1:15:12] Christ very true
[1:15:16] words just as much in effect today
[1:15:19] closer to coming to pass than when he
[1:15:21] said
[1:15:22] them
[1:15:24] and he he's literally talking about all
[1:15:27] the people all their Church Steeples all
[1:15:30] their everything I mean I forget how
[1:15:33] many I think I heard a quote a number
[1:15:35] some years
[1:15:36] ago um maybe maybe 15 or so years ago so
[1:15:40] it might be significantly more than this
[1:15:43] now you say what might be a possible
[1:15:47] death
[1:15:48] toll well just there are 20 a as a 15 or
[1:15:53] so years ago there was 20 million people
[1:15:57] in the San Fernando Valley
[1:16:00] alone 20
[1:16:02] million and this thing is500 miles long
[1:16:06] 350 miles wide going a mile down the
[1:16:10] tidal waves and the and the islands and
[1:16:13] the tsunamis my goodness friends we're
[1:16:16] not talking catastrophic we're talking
[1:16:19] cataclysmic we're talking about the
[1:16:21] Western Seaboard of the greatest nation
[1:16:23] going a mile down into the
[1:16:26] ocean hide me in the Rock oh Jesus hide
[1:16:29] me Lord fill me full of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:31] if you don't have it tonight say Lord
[1:16:33] fill me full of the Holy
[1:16:36] Ghost the problem is that people are
[1:16:39] under the headship from the God of this
[1:16:42] evil age which is none other than
[1:16:46] Lucifer you don't want to lose sight of
[1:16:48] this fact friends that an influence of
[1:16:51] EMA of evil
[1:16:53] there's a tremendous influence of evil
[1:16:56] that permeates the world here at the end
[1:16:59] time just as the scripture foretold that
[1:17:02] it would I'm not going to read all of
[1:17:04] these passages tonight we may look at
[1:17:06] them more thoroughly on Sunday but
[1:17:09] Daniel is told in the 12th chapter to
[1:17:11] shut up the words and seal the book
[1:17:13] because many shall run to and fro and
[1:17:16] knowledge shall be increased we're
[1:17:18] reminded where Paul tells Timothy that
[1:17:22] we've read it before poor in the last in
[1:17:24] the last days perilous times would come
[1:17:27] and we go down the list lovers of
[1:17:29] pleasure and Covetous and boasters and
[1:17:31] blasphemers and disobedient to parents
[1:17:33] and unthankful and Unholy without
[1:17:35] natural affection truce Breakers false
[1:17:37] accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of
[1:17:40] those that are
[1:17:41] good that's about as Twisted as you can
[1:17:44] get where you actually are really bad
[1:17:47] but you hate the people who are good I
[1:17:49] mean that's just a sickness and it's and
[1:17:52] it's it's not it's not a an airborne
[1:17:55] disease it's the
[1:17:57] devil it's the God of this evil age
[1:18:00] Jesus tells about how that the the days
[1:18:03] would have to be short unless there
[1:18:04] wouldn't even be any flesh saved he
[1:18:06] tells in Matthew
[1:18:08] 24 how that there would arise false
[1:18:10] christs and false prophets and show
[1:18:12] Great Signs to the degree that they
[1:18:15] could deceive the elected if that were
[1:18:18] possible thank God it's not we've
[1:18:20] already commented on the effects of re
[1:18:23] ation 13 not going to take the time to
[1:18:25] read it tonight the evil that permeates
[1:18:28] the world I'm here to tell you the evil
[1:18:30] at this end time is a very ancient evil
[1:18:34] amen amen I want you to get your mind
[1:18:37] around that it's a very ancient evil
[1:18:41] it's been here a very long time and fact
[1:18:46] is it predates the arrival of mankind in
[1:18:49] the Garden of Eden it was here waiting
[1:18:52] waiting on
[1:18:54] Adam when he came on the scene in a
[1:18:56] human body built out of the Dust of the
[1:18:58] Earth this tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:19:01] Evil was a person whom the prophet
[1:19:06] Ezekiel seen in a vision and spoke of
[1:19:10] him as a man and in that he came and and
[1:19:13] likened him to a a
[1:19:16] king thou Hast been in Eden the Garden
[1:19:20] of God every precious stone was like
[1:19:23] covering the Sardis topaz and Diamond
[1:19:26] the barrel the Onyx The Jasper the
[1:19:27] sapphire the emerald the carbuncle the
[1:19:30] gold these are precious gems the
[1:19:32] workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy
[1:19:34] pipes were prepared was prepared in thee
[1:19:37] in the day that thou was created so so
[1:19:41] this man the Bible says that that when
[1:19:44] they walk Satan out at the Judgment bar
[1:19:48] that the world shall the Bible says they
[1:19:50] shall narrowly look on him
[1:19:54] him it's almost derision it's it's it is
[1:19:57] derision it's it's unbelief it's
[1:19:59] astonishment it's stupic and they're
[1:20:01] going to say is this the
[1:20:05] man that deceived
[1:20:08] Nations you mean we're all going to the
[1:20:11] lake of fire because of this one
[1:20:16] man we had all the preachers but one man
[1:20:19] doomed
[1:20:21] us we had all the Nations and all the
[1:20:23] governments and all the armies and all
[1:20:25] the gold and all the money and one
[1:20:28] man that we followed is our undoing
[1:20:32] am so this man wasn't born like a man
[1:20:36] would be because he had been created by
[1:20:39] God Before Time as an archangel very
[1:20:42] powerful very beautiful a very
[1:20:45] charismatic preacher of
[1:20:48] preachers he was the leader of worship
[1:20:52] in in
[1:20:54] Heaven until sin was discovered in him
[1:20:59] and from there he was cast out of Heaven
[1:21:02] down to the Earth Paradise was lost
[1:21:05] forever to him Bound in Everlasting
[1:21:09] chains of Darkness he languished for
[1:21:12] some indeterminate unknown amount of
[1:21:15] time we don't really know how long he
[1:21:18] walked upon the volcanics he and and and
[1:21:21] and brother Brandon talks about it in
[1:21:23] the beginning God created the heavens
[1:21:24] and the Earth period doesn't tell how
[1:21:26] long we only know we start counting uh
[1:21:28] in cycles of days which represent a
[1:21:30] representative of years uh once God
[1:21:33] starts developing it into and starts
[1:21:35] bringing life and starts bringing
[1:21:37] order but we know that he walked to and
[1:21:40] fro and as far as his movements through
[1:21:42] the Earth having no one or nothing that
[1:21:45] he could work through he was nearly
[1:21:47] powerless brother brandham said a
[1:21:48] demon's just nearly powerless unless he
[1:21:51] has someone to work through
[1:21:53] once God
[1:21:54] began his Divine evolution of life on
[1:21:58] Earth Lucifer watched from the
[1:22:02] sidelines once God's once God's version
[1:22:06] of Natural Evolution built up the animal
[1:22:10] built from mineral you know uh and built
[1:22:13] up to botney and then built up to animal
[1:22:15] and then built all the way up into the
[1:22:16] image of man and along the way he builds
[1:22:19] a serpent and then thereafter in short
[1:22:22] AR he places his own family in flesh
[1:22:26] with Eve as a vulnerable byproduct and
[1:22:29] right then Satan saw his
[1:22:34] chance Adam and his bride is this
[1:22:39] okay Adam and his bride were warned of
[1:22:45] God about their proximity to
[1:22:49] him Satan had in fact set up shop right
[1:22:52] in the midst of the garden right next to
[1:22:55] the tree of life because that's what the
[1:22:57] devil always does he likes to try to
[1:23:00] fake it that he's the real
[1:23:03] thing he builds himself very close the
[1:23:06] false church is a church that uses the
[1:23:09] same Bible and sings the same songs and
[1:23:12] calls on the same God and uses the name
[1:23:15] j s u
[1:23:17] s and because the rain falls on the UN
[1:23:20] the just and the unjust and because in
[1:23:22] anybody can learn how to operate faith
[1:23:24] brother brandom said I've seen
[1:23:26] prostitutes come through the line and
[1:23:27] get their healing and the saint of God
[1:23:29] miss it because it's
[1:23:31] faith and they've learned how to operate
[1:23:33] it and it it doesn't last they asked
[1:23:35] brother brandom do you have to be a
[1:23:37] Christian to be healed he said no you
[1:23:38] don't have to be a Christian to be
[1:23:39] healed but you're going to want to be a
[1:23:41] Christian if you want to stay healed
[1:23:42] yeah because a lot of times under under
[1:23:45] that anointing it quick in people's
[1:23:47] faith and brother Brandon would even say
[1:23:49] sir you didn't know you had that kind of
[1:23:50] Faith did you so faith is a sub subance
[1:23:52] but it's it's not something in your
[1:23:54] conscience mind it's in the subconscious
[1:23:56] it's a sixth sense say what can I do to
[1:24:00] access it start confessing this you
[1:24:03] don't try to uh uh hijack the the six
[1:24:06] sense use the ones you've God and just
[1:24:09] start saying what God Said in his word
[1:24:11] and start living your life by this don't
[1:24:13] you worry God will operate the
[1:24:16] faith you don't have to make it work you
[1:24:18] try to make it work that's why you can't
[1:24:19] make it work it's not your job it's
[1:24:22] Supernatural it's a revelation just
[1:24:24] start by saying Amen to the word you
[1:24:27] have using the senses you
[1:24:30] have is that
[1:24:32] easy see so we find that he had
[1:24:37] literally set up his false church right
[1:24:41] beside the tree of life and the we see
[1:24:44] the false church has done the same thing
[1:24:45] ever since Adam and his bride were
[1:24:49] strictly cautioned not to have anything
[1:24:53] to do with this evil presence amen don't
[1:24:57] eat from it don't talk to it don't have
[1:25:01] nothing to do with him Amen in fact as
[1:25:04] Eve would later inform Us in the
[1:25:07] scripture corresponding in my mind
[1:25:09] personally anyway to to the correlating
[1:25:13] to shunning why we should shun the very
[1:25:15] appearance of evil because she actually
[1:25:18] adds in a denim we're not we're not
[1:25:20] we're not to even touch it amen amen
[1:25:24] see so brother brandom goes on and be
[1:25:27] certain of
[1:25:28] God we may not think that we are Idol
[1:25:31] worshippers but we
[1:25:33] are and the government endorses it
[1:25:37] people today are Idol worshippers
[1:25:39] because they worship idols some of them
[1:25:42] worship movie stars for Idols some
[1:25:44] worship money for Idols some worship
[1:25:47] television stars for as Idols you say
[1:25:51] well what give me the
[1:25:53] definition all that you put before God
[1:25:58] is an
[1:25:59] idol whatever it is it it of itself may
[1:26:03] not be evil but if you put it before God
[1:26:07] then you are prostituting your time that
[1:26:10] you owe to God and you're giving
[1:26:12] something else a position in your life
[1:26:14] that it didn't die for you and it don't
[1:26:16] have the right you shouldn't give it
[1:26:18] that kind of homage you owe your life to
[1:26:21] Christ amen amen and he's to be first
[1:26:24] he's to be the center brother brandom
[1:26:26] said don't make him second he he don't
[1:26:28] want to be second and he don't deserve
[1:26:30] to be second
[1:26:33] am some worship television stars movies
[1:26:37] money whatever you put before God as an
[1:26:39] idol let it be whatever it may be so
[1:26:42] here we can see government does endorse
[1:26:45] religion
[1:26:46] actually as long as it's
[1:26:49] Satan's see they're worshiping idols
[1:26:52] yeah and so the government is backing
[1:26:54] religion don't say you know they say oh
[1:26:57] separation of church and state that's
[1:26:58] only if it's God but when it comes to
[1:27:01] the God of this evil age they're all in
[1:27:03] religion they love that religion they
[1:27:06] love the worship of Idols
[1:27:09] see see so you know but but let it speak
[1:27:13] about the unadulterated truth of God's
[1:27:15] word and then they don't want nothing to
[1:27:16] do with them they want to shut you down
[1:27:17] but he says we've got to the place to
[1:27:20] think that because we're resting upon
[1:27:24] what our forefathers did or Upon Our
[1:27:27] great founders of our church what their
[1:27:30] great sacrifice was to God which is all
[1:27:33] right and so much appreciated listen now
[1:27:36] but we cannot draw salvation from what
[1:27:39] they did salvation is an individual
[1:27:43] Affair between every person and God amen
[1:27:48] amen it's not with your nation it's not
[1:27:51] with your church
[1:27:52] but with ourselves before God we
[1:27:58] answer this nation won't be my final
[1:28:00] Arbiter he will you won't be he
[1:28:04] will I I owe my life to him who has
[1:28:07] given me
[1:28:09] everything
[1:28:12] Hallelujah would you really friends come
[1:28:14] on think about it would you really take
[1:28:18] something as an idol and put it ahead of
[1:28:21] your allegiance to God and put it in the
[1:28:23] place that Jesus Paid such a high price
[1:28:27] to
[1:28:28] occupy and you would deny
[1:28:31] him would you deny him the love and
[1:28:35] compassion to your fellow man that he
[1:28:37] paid such a high price to be able to
[1:28:40] have and send it through
[1:28:42] you but we have carnality in our lives
[1:28:46] we hold anger and bitterness and
[1:28:49] unforgiveness we hold sin and carnality
[1:28:51] and edginess you know all of these
[1:28:54] things and all you do is stop up all the
[1:28:56] channels and the Holy Spirit can't flow
[1:28:58] through
[1:29:02] us not here to correct the United States
[1:29:05] tonight they don't want to hear it I
[1:29:08] assume you want to hear it that's why
[1:29:09] you're
[1:29:12] here there is so much
[1:29:15] uncertainty
[1:29:18] everywhere I just I just it seemed like
[1:29:21] when I started studying this every time
[1:29:22] I would look at a headline every time
[1:29:24] I'd walk past something and there'd be
[1:29:26] it it just seemed like every everywhere
[1:29:28] I looked it was all uncertainty there's
[1:29:31] uncertainty in the mortgage markets and
[1:29:35] uncertainty in the interest rates and
[1:29:38] there's uncertainty and housing and
[1:29:40] there's there's uncertainty over coid 19
[1:29:43] and there's uncertainty over vaccines
[1:29:45] and then boosters and now more boosters
[1:29:48] and you know you got some doctors saying
[1:29:50] it's a it's a risk re reward decision
[1:29:52] you got to weigh all the factors and
[1:29:54] kind of pick the lesser of the two evils
[1:29:56] oh my goodness I'm glad I don't have to
[1:29:59] do that with
[1:30:00] this I'm glad that I can just believe
[1:30:03] every word and I don't need the CDC to
[1:30:05] tell me it's okay or it's safe or it's
[1:30:07] effective I can just go right through
[1:30:08] here and believe it and claim it and
[1:30:10] it'll actually operate in my
[1:30:13] life I mean you know and then you've got
[1:30:16] other doctors very high ranking doctors
[1:30:18] even all the way up to um um the surgeon
[1:30:21] generals of certain States saying that
[1:30:24] they would never recommend a human being
[1:30:26] taking this new booster that's being
[1:30:28] pushed by the
[1:30:29] CDC and you don't know because politics
[1:30:32] has ruined the science and and the
[1:30:34] legitimate medical field so badly that
[1:30:36] you don't know
[1:30:38] anymore you don't know who to trust and
[1:30:40] when Co hit I stood here and I said
[1:30:42] listen friends we're not going to live
[1:30:44] in fear because I'm here to tell you
[1:30:46] there'll be five behind this one and 10
[1:30:48] behind that one and 20 behind that one
[1:30:50] it ain't getting better it's getting
[1:30:51] getting worse and you better have your
[1:30:53] trust in the word of
[1:30:59] God know the the CDC do we trust them
[1:31:03] the World Health Organization do we
[1:31:04] trust them I don't know are they sold
[1:31:07] out it looks like it maybe I don't know
[1:31:08] possibly I don't know could it
[1:31:11] be I mean th this is what the world has
[1:31:14] to Grapple with they will have to
[1:31:16] Grapple with that tomorrow I'm preaching
[1:31:18] to you tonight so you don't have to you
[1:31:21] don't have to be uncertain you can be
[1:31:24] certain of
[1:31:26] God we used to be able to trust in the
[1:31:29] public education of our children you
[1:31:31] don't even know what they're teaching
[1:31:32] them these days only it ain't
[1:31:35] good the perverted agenda of our
[1:31:38] propaganda institutions that they call
[1:31:41] institutions of Higher Learning Satan I
[1:31:44] mean Satan Satan has so broken down
[1:31:47] society and divided society and
[1:31:50] polarized Society to where you know we
[1:31:53] we we used to have each other's back and
[1:31:56] I mean you could count on your good
[1:31:58] conservative neighbor and now you don't
[1:32:00] even know anymore that that fine
[1:32:02] conservative neighbor might suddenly go
[1:32:04] woke and double cross
[1:32:06] you you you you don't know what
[1:32:08] buildings to go and what words to say
[1:32:10] not to say and if I say the wrong thing
[1:32:12] and this is incorrect that's incorrect
[1:32:13] somebody's going to get mad everybody
[1:32:14] gets mad over
[1:32:16] something I mean friends the world has
[1:32:18] gone
[1:32:20] insane there's only one way out and
[1:32:23] that's up and there's only one mind I'm
[1:32:26] interested in
[1:32:28] having forsake the world forsake it
[1:32:31] they're crazy here's the only mind worth
[1:32:37] having you're daring to say the wrong
[1:32:40] thing in the wrong place to the wrong
[1:32:41] people I mean they're even starting to
[1:32:43] get legal
[1:32:45] ramifications people are being arrested
[1:32:47] and put in jail in some countries thank
[1:32:49] God I haven't seen it here yet
[1:32:52] my and and and and and we know we know
[1:32:56] by prophecy there's going to be a global
[1:32:58] takeover of the Antichrist that's not in
[1:33:01] question we there's uncertainty about
[1:33:04] what it's going to look like and how
[1:33:06] it's all goingon to how it's all going
[1:33:07] to wind out and you
[1:33:10] know it looks like it you know that it
[1:33:13] it may be uh in fact is sometimes I
[1:33:16] wonder if the thing that might bring the
[1:33:19] boycott and put the conservative Church
[1:33:22] into the Hip Pocket of the Vatican is a
[1:33:25] consolidation to stop the left woke
[1:33:28] ideology to say finally enough's
[1:33:32] enough see I mean I'm not here to I'm
[1:33:34] not here to preach politics and I'm not
[1:33:35] here to I'm not in here for the gospel
[1:33:37] preacher I don't know nothing about it
[1:33:39] but you but but I do know this that that
[1:33:42] we don't know exactly how it's all going
[1:33:44] to come out I do know that when you
[1:33:48] can't buy or sell except you have that
[1:33:50] Mark I know the bride doesn't see that I
[1:33:53] know by prophecy she's already gone but
[1:33:55] what I don't know is how close we might
[1:33:56] get to that I'm here to tell you you're
[1:33:58] going to need this you're going to need
[1:34:01] this you can't depend on any other
[1:34:05] source see we know certain elements that
[1:34:09] that that we won't see but we don't know
[1:34:11] exactly how close we're going to get to
[1:34:13] some of these things before we leave
[1:34:14] here our Pro listen our prophetic model
[1:34:18] one of our prophetic models is the is
[1:34:20] the story of Noah who brother brandham
[1:34:24] said contrary to almost all of the
[1:34:26] theologians they think that Noah the day
[1:34:29] he entered the Ark it started raining
[1:34:31] because of the way Genesis has it listed
[1:34:32] and it's somewhat ambiguous and you can
[1:34:34] almost read it in both ways I'm so glad
[1:34:36] I got a prophet who could just say Noah
[1:34:39] went in the ark and God closed the door
[1:34:42] and nothing happened for seven days and
[1:34:45] he brother brandham called that the
[1:34:47] third pool of his ministry it was
[1:34:49] preaching to souls in in prison who were
[1:34:52] already sealed their fate on the outside
[1:34:55] and they were doomed and that went for
[1:34:57] seven days before the rains
[1:35:02] came so how does that how brother Jason
[1:35:04] how does that apply into our lives we'll
[1:35:06] see we'll see I just know I want to make
[1:35:09] sure I'm in the ark Hallelujah there is
[1:35:13] an ark there is a safety there is a
[1:35:16] design plan God has every detail about
[1:35:20] your life how you can get in and you
[1:35:21] don't have to worry I'm here to tell you
[1:35:24] something friends don't live in
[1:35:25] uncertainty be certain of God you have
[1:35:28] the privilege tonight to be certain of
[1:35:34] God and they went and they went
[1:35:37] in went in male and female of All Flesh
[1:35:41] and as God commanded him and the Lord
[1:35:45] shut him
[1:35:46] in I seen an article some Pastor
[1:35:50] recently I remember who it was now
[1:35:51] posted it where they you know they
[1:35:55] they've they've they've got div Division
[1:35:58] I don't know how big it is I don't even
[1:35:59] know how how relevant it is it's it's
[1:36:02] nothing to me because I know they're
[1:36:04] just stupid anyway and he says he said
[1:36:06] they they think that these UFOs some of
[1:36:09] some of the Pentagon top Pentagon people
[1:36:11] are whispering in in in in closed
[1:36:14] sessions saying you think these things
[1:36:16] might be
[1:36:18] demons and they're they're losing sleep
[1:36:21] at night CU they're worried because they
[1:36:22] they definitely know that these Radars
[1:36:25] are picking up something they definitely
[1:36:27] know their cameras are seeing something
[1:36:29] they definitely know it's some kind of
[1:36:31] craft they definitely know we can't
[1:36:33] track it catch it reproduce it can't do
[1:36:35] anything and and do you do you and and
[1:36:38] we know that you know they think we have
[1:36:40] bodies we know we don't maybe this is
[1:36:43] demons if I had to go to sleep every

[1:50:39] ready
[1:50:41] well I installed this
[1:50:44] software which didn't install correctly
[1:50:47] which resulted in
[1:50:50] um my server completely
[1:50:52] crashing that brought down the security
[1:50:56] for systems around the
[1:50:59] world I
[1:51:01] worked all day long yesterday trying to
[1:51:06] do disaster restores and everything to

[1:51:11] working working with other government
[1:51:13] officials and everything to try to get
[1:51:15] it working and it just would not come up
[1:51:18] so um I went to the restroom and on my
[1:51:21] way back from the restroom I was out in
[1:51:23] the hallway where just by myself and I
[1:51:25] started to pray I said Lord you know I

[1:52:17] that I was going to go in and I was
[1:52:19] going to go to this machine and I was
[1:52:20] going to take
[1:52:22] and do this one thing which was going to

[1:59:51] at home in this
[1:59:54] world
[1:59:56] anymore oh Lord you
[2:00:00] know I have no friend like
[2:00:04] you if Heaven not my
[2:00:08] home then Lord what will I
[2:00:12] do the Angels Be Me from Heaven open
[2:00:19] door and I can't feel at home in this
[2:00:25] world
