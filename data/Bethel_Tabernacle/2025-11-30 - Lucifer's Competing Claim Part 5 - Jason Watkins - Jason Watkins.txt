Only one name under heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, I have a couple of prayer requests, but I have a little thought that I wanted to share with you that I had when um we went hiking [music] up in North Carolina last weekend. And um I was thinking about Enoch, you know, where the Bible says he walked with God and he was not cuz God took him. And you know, in my mind, many times I'm thinking like he's out there all alone walking some beautiful wilderness road where there's nothing around. And um but you know, it was probably I and I [music] called it the Enoch trail, which is a trail I want to be on because um I like the end result. Amen. I want God to take me. But, you know, he had kids, had wife, children, probably had grandkids, too, lived a life just like you and I do. And that's so I want to walk to where God takes me. Amen. The Enoch Trail. I have two prayer requests from Brother Kevin. Uh Dave Ward, a 10-year-old boy. Now, can you imagine with cancer? [music] He is starting more treatment tomorrow. Praying for him and family. He needs a miracle. Davian Wartz, you want to remember that. And then [music] Jess Martin, wife of a deputy, kidney issues. We'll be starting dialysis immediately, I believe. I understand [music] she needs a kidney transplant. Of course, you know, that hit home. There's some a teacher that no longer is teaching with Melissa because [music] she has breast cancer. She's going through treatment. You know, I have um I have a uh the grandmother of my grandkids on the other side. She's she's in [music] her second round of cancer treatment for breast cancer. So, we just want to remember these. You know, these [music] people, Miss Barnes, they're looking at you and me and anybody that has faith to touch the throne of God for their sickness. So, we want to pray for them this morning. Let's pray. Father, I love you this morning, Lord. And I am so grateful, Father, that you have made a way that [music] we can come to you. The scripture says that because you bend down, I will pray. So I look to you this morning, these requests, I can't perform some miracle of a scalpel and things like that. A 10-year-old [music] boy, Father. Lord, I pray I lift him up before you in the name of Jesus Christ fighting cancer. Father, Lord, we know there's a life there. We come against that life that is [music] affecting those cells. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray that you would as our brother requested is saying [music] he needs a miracle. And we know that you're a miracle working God this morning for Jess. [music] Martin, father, his wife. Lord, I pray for her kidney issues, [music] starting dialysis. What a trial. I pray that you would touch her body, Lord. If she has to continue to go this way, I pray that you would help her every step of the way. But I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord, that you would just intervene. Touch her kidneys, [music] Father. Touch her body. Help her husband this morning, this day. Help him to help take care of her. Help whatever goes through that family. I pray I lift him up before you, Father. Lord, we rejoice that we have an advocate, a healer, Father, that we can come to [music] today that paid the full price and we believe it. We accept it. We pray for these [music] people, Lord. Those that are on the hearts of the people today, we pray for them, Father. We love and worship you. And as we collect the tithes and offerings, I [music] pray that you would bless the cheerful giver. Father, we thank you abundantly with grateful hearts for the body that you give us in Jesus name. Amen. I'm going to see a victory. [music and singing] I'm going to see a victory for the battle belongs to you, Lord. I'm going to see a [music and singing] victory. I'm going to see a victory.

Above all, above all power, above all kings, above [music] all [singing] naturaturated things, [music] above all wisdom and all the ways of Man, you were here before the world behead.

You took the fall, &gt;&gt; thought [music] of me and thought of me. &gt;&gt; Thank God. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you glad for that call today? Give the Lord a hand of worship and praise. [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; You know, I never want to think of [music] that as a as just a dry ritual. I think the Lord is worthy of all the praise we [music] can give him. You could stand here for an hour with thunderous applause to him and you wouldn't scratch the surface of his worth. [music] Amen. I want to talk a little bit about ritualistic things today. So, ritualism as it were. Um, I'm going to invite you into the scriptures straight away, uh, to Isaiah 29. And while you're finding your place in Isaiah 29, like to just make a couple of quick announcements and we got a prayer request that got sent in for Sister Lauren. Um, Amen. Happy to our visitors here with us. God bless you. We're happy to have you here with us today, man. Trust you'll enjoy the presence of the Lord. Amen. In the uh, camp of the King. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Our um our winter meetings are officially set. We've been kind of mentioning it along as we go. They're set for the second weekend of December, December 12, 13, and 14. and Sunday. On Friday the 12th, the service will begin at 700 p.m. And um and then on Saturday the 13th, we're looking to make that an all day event of special activities. Um kind of like what we have had in the past with our harvest fest and uh we our youth camp has kind of crowded that out a little bit. So, we're [clears throat] going to try to combine that as we've did in the past with special ministry and coming in. We want to make it all word-based and focused around the word of God. I'm not looking to celebrate a man-made holiday. Amen. But, um, but that's going to be Saturday the 13th. It'll be an all day event of special activities. It'll begin with, and this is an announcement for here, but also on the internet, they'll hear it. Um, Saturday will begin with a minister's breakfast. Um, followed um later, Brother Aaron McGary will be with us, him and his family. Amen. And they're we're looking forward to having them with us. Haven't had him here in a while. Amen. So, um, looking forward to that. He'll be speaking at the ministers breakfast. And then Saturday, um there'll be um that so there'll be a minister's breakfast on Saturday followed by family and children activities beginning in the early afternoon. We haven't yet determined with certainty a location that's still we're still working on the best solution for that. [clears throat] But uh at any rate, that'll begin in the early afternoon. There'll be food and fellowship and a bonfire in the evening. There'll be no evening service per se. It'll be all day activities and in the evening we'll have a bonfire with singing and worship and brother Aaron will give us a fireside address at that time. Sunday then of course will begin uh at our usual times and we'll make further announcements concerning um the midweek service leading up to that. Uh the Sunday school classes on that Sunday. We'll figure all that out and get our ducks in a row on that. decide well how we want to go forward and we'll be sure to let you know that uh all updates and reminders and announcements will go out in our churchwide WhatsApp chat. So just be monitoring that. We'll make continued announcements as we go along. So anyone listening online who would like to come be a part of that weekend with us. You're certainly welcome and invited uh to be with us. Amen. Any family, friends that you'd like to bring, Amen. That'd be wonderful. bring them to the house of God and we'll fill them up with spiritual food and natural food and fellowship and Amen. slap them enough times on the back, knock all the devil in the world out of them. [laughter] Amen. Praise the Lord. Um, Brother Don sent in a prayer request for sister Lauren. Said she pulled a muscle in her shoulder two days ago. She may have a pinched nerve or something. This morning she's in excruciating pain. I'm taking her to urgent care clinic to try [clears throat] to help her. So, he's asking, excuse me, for prayer for that. Praise the Lord. In Isaiah, we're just going to read one verse. I'm not going to be able to read Isaiah out of Jeremiah, will I? &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 29, we're going to read one um verse here and we will let you be seated and then we'll go to prayer and take up this prayer request for our sister. [clears throat] Amen. Praise the Lord. Isaiah 29:13. Wherefore the Lord said, "For as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed [snorts] their hearts far from me, and their fear toward me [clears throat] is taught by the precept of men." So that's just a a [snorts] way of in Old Testament language of saying you've let men explain away the value of what I've said in my word. And you've determined that your fear, your admiration, your awe, your respect toward me is you've decided to base it on not what I've said, but what men tell you. &gt;&gt; And [clears throat] so this was a real problem for the Lord. Amen. Let's let's bow our heads. Master, we come to you in thanksgiving today for the word that's been read, the songs that have been sung, the people are gathered. All things are ready now, Lord, to hear from you in your word. We pray that you will as you have blessed your word in the speaking of the word, the reading of the word, the hearing of it read. May you also bless the speaker and the listening audience today as we are here Lord not to impart our own thinking but [clears throat] only as you have led us in through the word of God. May we deliver that Lord today purely and we commit it to you now Lord. We turn and ask mercy for our sister Lauren in excruciating pain. Lord, [snorts] I those kinds of injuries many of us know all too well. And we're asking for your mercy now for our sister right now. Lord, may the healing hand of Christ lay upon her and touch her and recover her. May she know, Lord, that temporary resurrection power today and set the matter right. I pray you'll grant it. Commit this now to you and all of us here together, one and all in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you, friends. You can be seated. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Amen. I see a number of visitors from family members are here. We're happy to have you all in the house of God. [snorts] Um I'm going to invite you with me to that little tiny book of Habach. It's not an easy book to find. If you uh hit Malachi and go back about four books, four or five books I think maybe four books prior to Malachi, you'll run into this small prophet of Habach. [clears throat] I want to continue today and hopefully we'll be able to conclude this series on Lucifer's counter claim. This will be the fifth installment as I remember um Habachok chapter 2 and we'll catch these first three verses. I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and I will watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I am reproved. And the Lord answered me and said, "Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, [clears throat] but at the end it shall speak and not lie. Though it tar, wait for it, because it will surely come, [clears throat] it will not tarry." So you know God is simply saying what you think of it as carrying is not what God thinks of it as carrying you know and we have a similar language used in the New Testament by the apostles I think it's either um either James or perhaps John that how that you know he that he that's coming he will not tarry &gt;&gt; and he's coming and and yet here we are 2,000 years latermen um seven church ages contiguous and continuous uh and and we've even went beyond God dealing with the last age dealing with the church. And so now and and that's on the church. That's not on Christ because Christ was busy walking in the middle of seven lampstands and um and he said, you know, I'll never leave you nor forsake you. It's the church that booted him out at the last day. Uniquely, ironically, and and it's a it's a unique age that had never really happened where in all 2,000 years of church history, Christian church history, that you would finally come down to the end of it all and put Christ out of the church. And and that's where you are uh [clears throat] you have so much self argrandisement, you have so much self-worth, you have so much self uh confidence, so much self-righteousness that you just you you know the age finally that says God, we have need of nothing. We're rich. We're increased with goods. We don't even need you. And so we're quite uh able to handle this on our own. Thank you. You can be excused. And so, you know, Christ is put on the outside of the church. And this is why brother Brandham would say and and you know, people uh it amuses me sometimes, you know, they want to disagree with William Brandom on things he would say and yet everything he's saying is right out of the scriptures and you fall on your face trying to prove it wrong and it doesn't end well. And I've I've I've been, you know, carrying this gospel, this message to six of the seven continents of the earth. And I've never found anyone yet who could take anything that we hold dear in the message ranks and things that a prophet brought us that can be disproven by the Bible. People, I'm not saying they can't make a case and make an argument, but at the end of the day, I know what works. I I can see results. See, so you we can all have an opinion, but how about we stick with what actually turns people into this? &gt;&gt; How about WE DECIDE TO ABANDON the things that cause people to go away from this? To now, to us, that seems simple. And you'd think the whole world would see that. But yet, we know the world [clears throat] in mass does not see that. And the Bible says they wouldn't, and they don't. The Bible says they would not and they would go to their destruction believing the lie and and not only uh believing a lie and that's a result of them closing their own eyes against truth they did that to themselves and and God just simply says you know since you did that since you didn't want my thinking in your thinking well then have at it go ahead knock yourself out I'll just turn you over to a repate mind and you'll believe a lie and be damned by it. And brother Brandham goes back through the Greek and Aramaic language to prove definitively that that term believe a lie is to believe the original lie. &gt;&gt; See the the lie that they're believing is not just a random lie. It's the original lie. And the original lie was that the original lie it's it you can't sum it up almost in a single sentence. The original lie was basically this, that you don't have to obey all of God's word. &gt;&gt; That was the original lie. &gt;&gt; That God's word can be compromised. That God's word can you can have a watered down version of God's word. You can keep 99% of it and you're only MISSING 1% AND GOD'S OKAY WITH THAT. That's not true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, it'll be okay." No, it it WON'T BE OKAY. OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER. OH, IT MATTERS. &gt;&gt; And the Bible prophesies, not that we decided anything. The Bible prophesies that the world would go in mass that there would only be a very few that would find the straight and narrow path that leads to eternal life. And it's not on God. It's on the human that made that conscious choice because God gives every human being that's ever been born a legit opportunity to save himself from destruction. And so, you know, we've we've mentioned to you many times before the the atheist loves to point to scriptures like God hardening Pharaoh's heart, but I've already shown you many times and five or six times the Bible says that before Pharaoh ever that before God ever hardened his heart, five or six times prior to that, Pharaoh hardened his own heart. See, and you say, "Well, God blinded them." Well, the the true Jews that God blinded get are are given white robes under the fifth seal. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM. GOD'S got them. See? AND SO SO IT'S THOSE who who literally Jesus said, "You closed your own eyes." See? So you're not going to impugn God with unrighteousness or unfairness or injustice. As I've said so many times, when you read the the the stenographers's report of the judgment bar, you don't really get that in Revelation. Revelation is kind of an overview. The the heavens peel back like a scroll. The the the the sea gives up its dead. The dead, both small and great, stand before him. The books are open. And another book is open called the book of life. And the people are judged from the books. But you don't get a you DON'T GET ANY OF the dialogue like a court's stenographers's record that keeps record of everything that the judge says and the witnesses say and the people say. You have to go to Matthew 25 to get that. And uh and and so you know when you when you read the details of the judgment as I've pointed out for years now there is no one going away. THERE'S A SLIGHT OBJECTION. HEY DON'T WE GET eternal life? Well, you know, we preached in your name and we did all THESE MIGHTY WORKS. AND AND THE JUDGE, the king will just say to them, "Yeah, but but you did it in iniquity. Your hearts were never converted. You you did that trying to trying to earn your way in, trying to use your works to convince me that you're that you're a real that you were a real Christian." And I guess THAT MAKES SENSE. WHY wouldn't they do that? They had spent their whole life doing that, &gt;&gt; trying to convince people they were a Christian because of their good works. So why wouldn't they present that to the judge as a last line of defense? But once that once that gets uh put down by the judge, by the king, then the people go away quietly to their destruction. There's no marching, there's no signs, there's no rioting, there's no there's no uprising, you know, nobody's uh marching and and chanting. it. They just they just quietly go to their fate because they know I promise you at that moment you can hide behind hypocrisy all day long, but at that moment there's nowhere to hide. You can't even hide behind your own self-righteousness. There is a knowing in the presence of that judge that you are guilty. I would to God that the presence of that judge be here today to show you now you're guilty. You need to repent. You need to give YOUR LIFE TO CHRIST. DON'T WAIT TILL YOU GET THERE. Then we are all going to stand before the judgment seat of Christ, Paul said, and give an account for our deeds whether they're good or bad. The question is not will I stand at his judgment seat. The question is when will I and where will I? And since this IS HIS JUDGMENT SEAT, I CHOOSE HERE AND NOW. I DON'T WANT TO GO WHILE THERE'S MERCY HERE and now. I don't want to go there and then when there's no mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These are rudimentary things we've taught on many times before here. But when you when you look at Habachok's prophecy, you know, this is um this is this is a time that that you know a lot of the prophecies are are coming to pass and you can go all the way back. HABACH IS A RESULT KIND OF GOING BACK IF WE I WOULD SAY MAYBE start back at Daniel and and from Daniel on he begins to tell about the end of the world. I'm not saying there's not other places messianic scriptures and millennial scriptures. I'm not saying that. But but PROPHECY CONCERNING THE WORLD, HEY, JUDGMENT'S coming &gt;&gt; and IT'S NOT NO, I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE MY MIND. IT'S COMING AND AND I'M giving you a fair warning. And and Daniel, you know, he was he wanted to know when will these he saw the end of the world. And that's why the book of REVELATION IS PROBABLY 75 TO 80% almost verbatim out of the book of Daniel. So John as a second witness is seeing it. And then and and probably the only remaining 25 20 to 25% is is catching those prophecies up and making them relative to the Christian church. See, SO SO SO THEN YOU CAN'T BACK UP AND SAY, "OH, THE OLD TESTAMENT, YOU KNOW, MALACHI 4 WAS TO ISRAEL." You think? &gt;&gt; No kidding. THE WHOLE ENTIRE OLD TESTAMENT WAS TO ISRAEL. OH, I mean it wasn't written to the Philistines &gt;&gt; or the Egyptians. &gt;&gt; You're the WHOLE THE OLD TESTAMENT WAS FOR THE JEWS. YEAH. BUT I MEAN, I STILL GET TO OBSERVE BY HIS STRIPES I'M HEALED. &gt;&gt; I still get TO UNDERSTAND THAT MY INIQUITY WAS PUT UPON HIM. THE CHASTISEMENT OF MY PEACE WAS UPON HIM. I STILL GET TO HAVE ABRAHAM'S FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I STILL GET THE SIGN OF THE SON OF MAN. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? A SILLY ARGUMENT THAT people make to try to resist the truth. And so, uh, so, so from Daniel on then you're going TO START GETTING THAT'S why you get all those that host of minor prophets, you know, those little two and three chapter ones that Naam and Habach hard to find and you got to hunt for them and kind of know where they are generally at least. And and so they're THEY'RE THEY'RE AUGMENTING EVERYTHING THAT DANIEL'S SAYING. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. AND IT RUNS ALL THE WAY THROUGH MALACHI, YOU KNOW, BEFORE THE COMING of the great and dreadful day of the Lord that Daniel HAD SAW. MY LORD, WHEN SHALL THESE THINGS BE? NO, NO, NO, DANIEL, go your way. You'll sleep with your father's not coming in your lifetime. It's sealed up for the end time. So, we see here that Habachok is just carrying on that same prophecy. Now, a a point to be made is that in verse three, let's have that back again, brother Josh. Habach chapter 2 uh verse three. There's some some notes here that JFP commentary point out that I wanted to bring forward. Uh Jameson Faucet Brown commentary, one of my very favorite ones for Old Testament commentary, Old Testament and New Testament. Uh [clears throat] and so verse three, for the vision is yet FOR AN APPOINTED TIME. SO now it's told that right there, BROTHER JOSH. SO, SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT all of these prophecies that are going to come to pass, and he's here to say that it shall BE FOR AN APPOINTED TIME, BUT at the end, it it it'll speak. See, and it WON'T IT WON'T LIE. SEE, it it IT'LL IT SHALL SPEAK AND NOT LIE. AND SO, SO ONE OF THE things that that JFB POINTS OUT QUOTING Mau is that that that THIS WORD IT SHALL NOT lie is in the Hebrew can be can be translated it shall not be silent. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S NOT LIKE A PROPHECY THEN IT DOESN'T COME TO pass &gt;&gt; cuz then you'd go, "Oh, it it lied." See, BUT THE BUT THE POINT IS IT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN LIKE YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD, but it won't be a lie. It won't BE SILENT. THERE'LL BE SOMETHING HAPPENING. YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE IT. &gt;&gt; THE WORLD MAY GO RIGHT ON AND NEVER SEE IT. BUT MY BUT THE AT THE END TIME THE PEOPLE WHO WHO KNOW THEIR GOD. SEE IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THEIR GOD IN A real and meaningful way with sincerity AND DEDICATION. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WILL KNOW THEIR GOD at the end time. See? SO HE'S SO THEY'RE SO THEY'RE GOING ON TO SAY then that it's the same. AND HERE'S A POINT THAT JFB POINTED TO. This is why that in the Hebrew language, this word is translated for us in Proverbs 12:17. Now, you don't have to turn there, Josh. Just hold right there at Habach. But in Proverbs 12:17, it says, "He that speaketh truth showeth forth righteousness." &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO THIS SHOWETH FOR HE SPEAKS TRUTH BUT IT'S NOT JUST UH IT'S NOT JUST WORDS. IT'S NOT LIP service that it actually MEANS HE WILL BREATHE OUT WORDS or he will break forth as A BLAST AND IT'LL BE IN THE FORM OF A DEMONSTRATION THAT IT THAT IT WON'T JUST BE SOMEONE PREACHING THAT IT'LL BE THE VOICE OF A LIVED EXPRESSION. SEE, so he that he that speaks with a living voice, HE THAT SPEAKETH TRUTH SHOWETH FORTH RIGHTEOUSNESS. IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW MANY VOICES AND BIBLE EXPOSITORS and teachers AND APOLOGISTS FILL THE airwaves speaking speaking a TRUTH &gt;&gt; BUT NOT SHOWING RIGHTEOUSNESS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's a problem BECAUSE THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE END TIME AND IT'S SHOWING THAT AT THE END TIME THIS IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR ISSUE THAT EVERYBODY WILL BE WITH WITH their lips they do worship and honor me as we read in Isaiah but their heart is far from me. SO, SO WHAT YOU'RE SEEING TODAY IS NOT an accident. IT GOD FORETOLD IT CENTURIES, MILLENNIA before here we are today, you're living IN IT. AND IN FACT is it it COULD HAVE BEEN SAID ALL ALONG DOWN THROUGH THE AGES that at the end time it'll get worse and worse AND WORSE AND FINALLY IT WOULD TAKE A PROPHET TO COME TO THE END TIME AND SAY NOW I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING IN THE NAME OF THE LORD IT WILL GET WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE TILL THE WORLD GOES COMPLETELY INSANE. THERE WILL BE NO PEACE UNTIL JESUS COMES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE, "THE CHURCH CANNOT GO IN A RAPTURE in its condition AND IT CAN'T GET ANY BETTER." WHY? BECAUSE THEY PUT CHRIST OUT. THE ONLY WAY YOU can be improved from your sin birth condition is to hear, recognize, AND ACT UPON EVERY WORD OF GOD. AND THAT ENTITLES YOU TO THE TOKEN. &gt;&gt; And that's the new birth. See, THEN THE BLOOD OF JESUS Christ is speaking for you and not until then. You have to walk in the light as he is in the light. See, SO THAT THAT'S NOT A NEW CONCEPT at the end time. THAT'S ALWAYS IT'S ALWAYS been shown that at the last day the that the righteous will be revealed because of the voice of their lived life. It is that that's the voice of the resurrection speaking through you THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID WHEN THAT HEADSTONE COMES DOWN AND REST UPON THAT BODY AND YOU SAY OH IT'S A PYRAMID THE HEADSTONE ITSELF IS A PYRAMID COMING DOWN UPON IT COMPLETING THE GREAT PYRAMID SEE AND SO THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE THAT WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM DREW IT HE'S GOT THAT IN HE'S GOT THAT THAT BLANK AREA IN BETWEEN THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID AND THE AND THE CAPSTONE AND HE'S WRITTEN IN THERE HOLY HOLY GHOST AND THERE'S NO IT'S ALL EMPTY AND IT'S JUST HOLY GHOST BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE AN INVISIBLE UNION IS TAKING PLACE. THE WORLD DOESN'T SEE IT. THEY CAN SEE THEY CAN TRACK IT THROUGH FAITH, TEMPERANCE, PATIENCE, ALL THESE. THEY CAN TRACK IT THROUGH PAUL AND ARMENIUS AND ALL THIS. THEY CAN AGREE WITH ALL THAT. BUT THEY COME TO THE END TIME AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. THERE'S NO GUARANTEE YOU'LL SEE IT JUST BECAUSE YOU SIT IN A MESSAGE CHURCH. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A REVELATION OF THAT THIS HEADSTONE AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS HEADSTONE. AND THAT'S WHERE THE INVISIBLE UNION IS TAKING PLACE. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS, HE SAID THE POWER THAT WE'VE HAD WILL COME INTO ITS FULLNESS TO THE DEGREE THAT THE DEAD FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS WILL COME OUT OF THE GRAVE. &gt;&gt; GOD, &gt;&gt; SO IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A LIVED LIFE. IT'S NEVER NOT BEEN THAT. &gt;&gt; SEE, THOUGH IT TAR, WAIT FOR it because it will surely come. It will not tarry. Now, I WANT TO CIRCLE BACK TO A FULL READING OF OUR of our scripture in Isaiah. So, let's go back there, brother Joshua. Isaiah 29, [clears throat] verse 9. STAY YOURSELVES IN WONDER. CRY YE ALOUD, and cry they that are drunken, but not with wine. They stagger, but not with strong drink. For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes, and prophets, the prophets, and your rulers, the seers hath he covered. &gt;&gt; And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee, and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed. Verse 12. And the book IS DELIVERED TO HIM THAT IS NOT LEARNED, SAYING, READ THIS, I PRAY THEE, and he saith, I am not learned. Wherefore the Lord said, for as much as this people, now we're coming down to our text, drawn near me with their mouth and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the PRECEPT OF MEN. THEREFORE, BECAUSE OF THAT, SINCE ALL OF THAT'S TRUE, BEHOLD, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder. For the wisdom, HERE'S THE MARVELOUS WORK, the wisdom OF THEIR WISE MEN SHALL PERISH, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, SO NOW THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT JESUS SAID WOULD be the situation when that no one COULD APPROACH GOD WITHOUT COMING THROUGH THE SON. &gt;&gt; OKAY, I I got a workar around for that. Well, but wait, THERE'S MORE. AND NO ONE CAN KNOW THE SON UNLESS THE FATHER REVEALS HIM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THERE YOU'RE EFFECTIVELY LOCKED OUT. WHETHER YOU COME FROM THE EAST, WEST, NORTH, OR SOUTH, &gt;&gt; from the heights, dropping in from the depths, RISING UP, YOU CAN'T get in. &gt;&gt; Christ has to Christ is the door. Christ is the word AND THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS TO OPEN THE EYES OF YOUR UNDERSTANDING. YES. &gt;&gt; SEE, &gt;&gt; SO JEHOVAH SPEAKING THROUGH Isaiah was cons he he IN THIS TIME THAT ISAIAH IS WRITING, HE'S CONFRONTING a great deal of blindness and hypocrisy in Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we know that the Lord is very gracious and merciful. He says that of himself. uh and and and HE WILL CONSISTENTLY seek to open the eyes of the blind, &gt;&gt; BUT HE HAS EXTRAORDINARILY LITTLE TO say to the hypocrite or the self-righteous &gt;&gt; other than to speak to them of their certain doom. THE THE THE THE BOTTOM LINE IS FRIENDS is that you cannot replace genuine spirituality with ritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a non-starter &gt;&gt; for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the message the communion um April the 18th, 1957. Now listen closely. Sometimes I put them up on the screen, sometimes I don't because I I sometimes I find it more effective just for you just to sit and listen. Now don't don't let your mind wander. Listen close. Brother Brandham says this is easy to follow. Now there is many that take the communion is not saved. Many eat the pascal lamb and perished in the wilderness. So he's talking about rituals and and orders and things that we have in the church. Many ate the pascal lamb and perished in the wilderness and many take the communion today that will never see God. &gt;&gt; But you cannot be a partaker of his salvation and not see him because salvation IS A GIFT OF God and communion is commemoration of the great allsufficient sacrifice that was made for that salvation. It's to let people see that we believe in the death. WHY DO WE HAVE THE the the ritual ceremony of of the Lord's supper? Why do we wash feet? Why do we why do we assemble in churches? Why do we baptize? All of these things. See, SO SO HE HE COMES BACK HERE. HE says um it's to let people see that we believe in the death, burial, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. It represents our ritual, a finished work. &gt;&gt; See, salvation was once not completed in the offering of the goat, the sheep, the hepher in the Old Testament because the Old Testament blood could not atone for sin. It could only COVER SIN. IT WAS A POINTING TO A time when it would be completed. So he says, "BUT WHEN JESUS came and his blood was shed at Calvary, it was a complete divorcing of sin. IT TAKEN SIN AWAY. IT'S THE only means of salvation. There is no church joining, no letters OF FELLOWSHIP. THERE IS NO RITUAL BAPTISM. THERE IS NO COMMUNION OR NOTHING in the ritual or any article THAT'S BEEN LEFT OF GOD AS ARTICLES PERTAINING TO SALVATION. It's all in commemoration of a finished work. Water baptism does not save you as much as people sometimes think it does. Water baptism is a commemoration of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Lord. It does not save you. Communion is the commemoration of his great agony and his going OUT AND HIS BROKEN body and his blood THAT WAS SHED. IT'S NOT THE LITERAL BLOOD. It's not the LITERAL BODY, BUT IT'S IN COMMEMORATION of his literal body and of his precious blood. And we take this as an order and Jesus commanded us to do it. As long as he stays away, we're to take it. We have that coming up on our on our last day of the of the year. We always do that on New Year's Eve. Have the Lord's supper. So, so now, so I wanted to read all of that to you so that YOU SO THAT WHAT I'M SAYING HAS PROPHETIC UTTERANCE BEHIND IT. Real spirituality is authentic and it's born of effort. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T FALL OUT OF A TREE AND CON YOU ON THE HEAD. &gt;&gt; REAL SPIRITUALITY. HOW MANY WANT THAT &gt;&gt; REAL SPIRITUALITY IS A BYPRODUCT OF A disciplined mind, body and soul. &gt;&gt; IT IS IN FACT IN SOME REGARD PROBABLY IN EVERY REGARD really in especially in the context OF MY SERMON TODAY it's a personal journey. IT'S IT RUNS DEEP AND IT'S IT'S GIVEN A PLACE OF IMPORTANCE IN THE individual who is seeking to serve God. &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT WHAT IS WHAT IS GIVEN IMPORTANCE? SPIRITUALITY. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE REALLY SPIRITUAL. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO JUST BE RITUALISTICALLY OBSERVANT. &gt;&gt; SEE, &gt;&gt; IT RUNS SO DEEP THAT IT THAT IT TRANSFORMS THE worshipper from within. It's very real. See, THIS IS WHY BROTHER BRANDON WOULD WORD IT THE WAY THAT HE DID. UH IT'S A VERY REAL THING. AND AND IT IT LITERALLY TRANSFORMS US from within. Ritualistic spirituality is mere surface performance. &gt;&gt; And the earth today is filled with it &gt;&gt; of Christian ritualism. JUST IT'S JUST A SURFACE performance without the true substance or much interchange if &gt;&gt; if any at all. &gt;&gt; Certain religious rituals have their place and we actually do have certain rituals and certain orders left to us. But without GENUINE INTENT AND PERSONAL DISCIPLINE, they will, I promise you, THEY WILL LACK THE transforming power THAT PRODUCES AUTHENTIC SPIRITUALITY. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE JUST COMING TO CHURCH CUZ IT'S JUST WHAT YOU DO. YOU'VE BEEN TAUGHT AND RAISED AND YOU WANT TO SEE THE PEOPLE AND YOU HANG OUT. IF YOU COME TO THE LORD'S SUPPER, BECAUSE IT'S JUST A RITUAL, IF YOU GO TO THE WATER AND GO DOWN A A DRY SINNER, YOU'LL COME UP A WET SINNER. &gt;&gt; SEE, THERE'S GOT TO BE AN EFFECTIVE CHANGE. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU YOU CAN'T GET IT YOURSELF, BUT I CAN GIVE YOU GOOD NEWS. IT IS IN HERE. &gt;&gt; And if you'll receive IT, IT WILL COME. AND THERE IS A SUPERNATURAL POWER THAT WILL CHANGE YOUR COMPLETE LIFE, MIND, BODY, AND SOUL. IRONICALLY, correct ritual performance is actually and and can be word-based, such as communion and footwashing, as I've said before, water baptism, the assembling at churches. Ironic because rituals generally um are considered WEAK AND INEFFECTIVE. BUT WHEN THEY ARE OBSERVED AND THEY'RE IN CONCERT WITH DEDICATION and sincerity, the ritual ACTUALLY BECOMES THE COMPLETION OF A duty before the Lord and is ACCEPTABLE IN HIS SIGHT A AS A SIGN OF YOUR SINCERITY. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT THEY RAN INTO IN MATTHEW 25. THEY PRESENTED SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS, BUT IT WAS NEVER WITH SINCERITY. AND IT'S DISALLOWED. SEE, &gt;&gt; IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE GROUPS THERE before the judgment seat. You don't see the bride. She's seated on the throne. She at that time she's got a thousand years of of judgment experience under her belt and she's well able to judge even angels. &gt;&gt; AND SO, SO YOU FIND THAT THERE'S TWO GROUPS AND BOTH GROUPS ARE SURPRISED. &gt;&gt; ONE GROUP WHO THOUGHT THEY WOULD GET IN BECAUSE of their ritual &gt;&gt; and got surprised that they're not getting in. &gt;&gt; Amen. and another group WHO WERE JUST SIMPLE PEOPLE WHO WHO LOVED GOD FOR REAL. THEY SERVED HIM FOR ALL THEY KNEW. They did THE BEST THEY COULD AND they were sincere in that AND EXPECTING REALLY NOTHING UH MORE THAN THE BLESSING THEY HAD ALREADY ENJOYED BY LIVING THAT KIND OF LIFE CUZ JUST LIVING THAT KIND OF LIFE IS A blessing on you. &gt;&gt; AND LO AND BEHOLD, THEY GET TO FIND OUT THAT THEY WERE GETTING CREDIT FOR THINGS THEY DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER DOING. AND PROBABLY THERE'S NO RECORD THAT THEY EVER DID IT. HALLELUJAH. BUT THEY INHERIT BUT THEY BUT BUT THEIR FAITH WAS TOWARD CHRIST FOR ALL THEY KNEW. AND JUST LIKE ABRAHAM, THOSE DEEDS WERE RECKONED UNTO THEM. &gt;&gt; LORD, we don't really remember visiting. I mean, I'm glad I did, BUT I REALLY DON'T REMEMBER DOING IT. &gt;&gt; BRINGING YOU A DRINK OF COLA. YEAH. I I DON'T REALLY I MEAN, I'M GLAD I DID IT, BUT I REALLY I'M HONEST. SEE, THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN HONEST. I I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER DOING THAT. AND THE KING JUST SAYS, "YEAH, IT'S MORE THE SAME. I WAS WATCHING YOU IN EARTH. DON'T WORRY. ENTER INTO THE JOYS OF THE LORD. I'M GOING TO GRANT YOU ETERNAL LIFE." I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. THERE'S VALUE IN BEING JUST SINCERE BEFORE GOD AND JUST BEING REAL AND LET GOD WORK IN YOUR LIFE. OH, HALLELUJAH. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T LIVE A LIFE OF SURFACE RITUALISM. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT DOCTRINE YOU'RE BELIEVING. SATAN DOESN'T CARE HOW RIGHT YOU ARE IN YOUR DOCTRINE. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS IF YOU MISS THAT LIFE, YOU WON'T COME UP ANYWAY. He'll win in the end anyhow. He wins by default because you were born in sin. See? So, so there's blindness and [snorts] then there's self blindness &gt;&gt; UPON WHICH GOD PRETTY MUCH pronounces no hope at all. But for those who want to be right, &gt;&gt; I am one of those today. I want to be right. &gt;&gt; I don't care what it costs me. I want to be right. &gt;&gt; And it's upon those that he makes a way of mercy even when they stumble. &gt;&gt; I'm going to have you turn uh well, let's just go on the screen because it's uh I don't want to slow you down. Nehemiah chapter 9, brother Josh, and just let's read along together. Uh, you know, when you read this, you're going to see that how God actually handled the the failures and constant failures and repeated failures of his family who loved him but failed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're going to see a heavenly father handle that with discipline and then forgiveness and restoration. And then they'll do it again. And he'll handle it like a loving father who loves his children. He'll discipline them. He'll set the order back in. And he'll give them another chance. Watch. Now, if he was this way under the blood of bulls and goats, friends, what must he be under the blood of Christ? Nehemiah 9:24. So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduest before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would. Verse 25. And they took strong cities and fat land and possessed houses full of goods, wells, digged vineyards and olive yards and fruit trees in abundance. So they did eat and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in thy great goodness. Nevertheless, they were disobedient and rebelled against thee and cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee. and they wrought great provocations. Therefore thou deliverest them into the hand of their enemies who vex them. And in the time of their trouble when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven. And according to thy manifold mercies, thou gavest them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their enemies. These were the judges and the prophets and the priests and mighty righteous kings who were saviors. Do you realize, friends, you're sent into the world as saviors? &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, you and and because Israel, this is a this is a the good, the bad, the ugly. This is the the believer, the makebeliever, and the unbeliever all mingled in together. But God preserved them. I mean, if you doubt that, then how did they get restored in 1948 with a six-point star of David? BECAUSE GOD HAS THEM INSCRIBED in the palms of his hands. I know he's not. He he he offered salvation to Pharisees, they're never going to take it. They're never going to be saved. Th those lawyers who stand at the door of knowledge and don't go in and and themselves and refuse entry to those who would go in. Those preachers who tell women it's okay. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, YOU KNOW, THE BIBLE SAYS YOU SHOULDN'T CUT YOUR HAIR AND THE WOMAN SAYS, BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM, MY PREACHER says it's okay. And he said he'll suffer for that in the regions beyond. Amen. &gt;&gt; I get why they want to imagine William Brandham as a false prophet, they need to believe that. They better hope that's true because if if it's if it's not and he was true, they're finished &gt;&gt; because he's already pronounced they'll suffer for that in the regions beyond. &gt;&gt; See, so so according to thy manifold mercies, thou gavest them saviors who saved them out of the hands of their enemies. Verse 28, but after they had rest, they did evil again before thee. Therefore le leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them. Yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven. AND MANY TIMES DID THOU DELIVER THEM ACCORDING TO THY MERCIES, AND TESTIFIED AGAINST THEM, THAT THOU MIGHTEST BRING THEM AGAIN UNTO thy law. Yet they doubt proudly, and hearken not under thy commands, but sinned against thy judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them. and withdrew THE SHOULDER AND HARDENED THEIR neck and would not hear. YET YET MANY YEARS DID THOU FORBEAR THEM AND TESTIFIED AGAINST THEM BY THE SPIRIT IN THY PROPHETS. Yet they would not give an ear. THEREFORE GAVEST THOU THEM INTO THE HAND OF THE PEOPLE OF THE LANDS. NEVERTHELESS, FOR THY GREAT MERCY'S SAKE, THOU DID not utterly consume them, nor forsake them, for thou art a gracious and merciful God. TAKE THAT ALONE HOME WITH YOU TODAY. He is a gracious and merciful God. HE MAY CHASTISE YOU IF YOU'RE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. HE WILL CHASTISE YOU PERHAPS WITH MANY STRIPES, BUT IT'S ALL IT'S THE TENDER HAND OF JEHOVAH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE TO YOU, BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU HIS THRONE, AS WE'VE BEEN PREACHING, IS ESTABLISHED IN MERCY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, the superiority then of the new covenant. We're going to get ready to go to First Corinthians. Brother Josh, take that down and let's get me 1 Corinthians chapter 12. And I'll we'll give you the starting point in a moment. SO, THE SUPERIORITY OF THE NEW COVENANT WAS THAT THE FAMILY OF God are all from Genesis. Let me say IT LIKE THIS. FROM GENESIS ALL THE WAY GOD FILLING UP THE ROLE ALL THE WAY Old Testament bride, New Testament bride, all the way to the consummation of the ages. Here's a point to remember that I'm going to prove it by Paul's writing. SO THE FAMILY OF GOD are all all and always and in every case all the family of God are born TO BE SPIRITUAL people who operate kingdom powers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IN A FALLEN WORLD. YES. &gt;&gt; SEE, &gt;&gt; and they DID THAT IN THE OLD TESTAMENT EVEN WITHOUT THE THE ADVANTAGE YOU HAVE of the baptism of the Holy Ghost giving them a new birth. &gt;&gt; See, SO PAUL SAID THIS IS WHY PAUL COMES TO 1 CORINTHIANS 12:7 TO 111. BUT THE MANIFESTATION OF THE spirit is given to every MAN TO PROFIT WITH ALL. FOR TO ONE IS GIVEN THE SPIRIT OF THE word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another the gift OF HEALING BY THE SAME SPIRIT, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another diverse kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation OF TONGUES. BUT ALL THESE WORKKETH that one in the selfsame spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. SO THEN WE FIND THAT IT becomes the design OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, THE HOLY GHOST BAPTISM. WHAT IS THE DESIGN? WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE HOLY GHOST COMING? TO LEAD YOU AND GUIDE YOU TO ALL TRUTH, WHICH WHEN YOU HEAR, RECOGNIZE AND AND FOLLOW, THEN THEN YOU ARE BORN AGAIN OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD. IT. SO THE WHOLE DESIGN OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IS TO BRING THE ZOEY LIFE THAT IS ALREADY WITHIN you from BIRTH TO MANIFESTATION. THAT'S HIS PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT THE HOLY GHOST ISN'T SANTA. &gt;&gt; He's not here to RECEIVE FROM YOU A WISH LIST. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? AS I'VE SAID FOR DECADES, HE'S NOT A VENDING MACHINE. WHEN YOU GET IN TROUBLE AND YOU WALK UP WITH 75 CENTS AND I NEED I NEED SOME HELP WITH THIS TROUBLE AND YOU PUT IN THE MONEY AND PULL A LEVER AND YOU GET A RESCUE. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE IS. THAT'S NOT WHY HE CAME. HE CAME TO BRING BECAUSE YOU WERE BORN WITH A PART OF HIS LIFE. AND HE'S COMING IN THIS AGE UNDER THE HOLY GHOST TO BRING THAT PART TO LIFE TO ANNIHILATE THE OLD YOU AND MAKE YOU A BRAND NEW CREATION in Christ Jesus. SO THAT WHY? SO THAT HE CAN SAY NOW YOU'RE SAVED. SEE YOU IN THE RAPTURE. NO, IT'S SO THAT YOU CAN GO THROUGH THE LAND AND BE A SAVIOR &gt;&gt; TO A DARK WORLD, TO YOUR FAMILY, TO OTHERS AROUND YOU. BUT YOU'LL NEVER BE THAT WITH COLD, FORMAL RITUALISM. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A DISCIPLINED MIND AND A BODY AND A SOUL THAT ADHERES TO THE WORD OF GOD AND SAYS, "LORD, BY WHATEVER MEANS YOU FIND NECESSARY, BRING ME TO THE IMAGE OF THIS WORD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S A PROCESS THAT WE CALL SCRIPTURALLY THE NEW birth or being born again. And from there then IT BECOMES THE DESIGN OF THE HOLY GHOST TO FLOW through the various gifts and callings that God installed in you and assigned to your life for his usage. &gt;&gt; I don't know how to explain the Holy Ghost clearer. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It is to transform you from the from the dark world you're born into into the glorious liberty OF THE SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; IT IS TO BRING A SEED GENE OF GOD THAT WAS INSTALLED IN YOU FROM BIRTH. AND INSIDE OF THAT IS GIFTS THAT HE HAS SEVERALLY GIFTED YOU WITH. AND THE WHOLE PURPOSE IS TO BRING YOU TO LIFE AND THEN SET YOU IN ORDER SO THAT HE CAN LIVE THROUGH YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, &gt;&gt; we come on THINGS IN THE BIBLE AND I want to turn a corner and run for the finish line now. You good? &gt;&gt; Don't get nervous. I'm fitting to close. &gt;&gt; Where's my amen sign? I don't have one. I need to make Diggs leave me that. No, but you're [snorts] pulling good enough already. And and and now here I suppose I could say might be a an equal burden to everything I've just said, an equal burden to my heart in this series of Lucifer's counter claim. You know, we left off with Joseph and there was there was things in Joseph's life and I hope this is okay cuz I'm I'm I'm from here. I'm not going to try to follow my notes line by line. I just want to talk to you from my heart. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; You've agreed so nicely with everything we've shown you uh through our lesson. So now let me get down to where it's applying into our lives. And this is the real burden of my heart. And you know we we've talked about Satan's counter claim to God's claim that God's going to have a kingdom of saints and he's going to dwell among them. And Lucifer's over here counter claiming that. No, I'm going to ascend above the stars of God. I'm going to take your throne and I'm going to sit in the north and I'm going to be like the most high God. Now, if you if you look at the world today, it looks very much like Satan has pulled that off. &gt;&gt; He is the god of the age by popular demand. &gt;&gt; He has had 6,000 years and he has magnificently crafted his Eden just like he his his Eden is nearly equal in sin as God's was in beauty. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's unprecedented. It's gone to levels where there's no rational thought anymore. IT'S JUST DEBAUCHERY DEBAUCHERY and decadence to the levels inexplicable levels &gt;&gt; on the common streets, laws and governments and courts and and I'm not here for a political soapbox, but I'm just here to tell you this is a sick, broken world we live in. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I'm glad to KNOW THAT GOD STILL HAS SAVIORS walking the streets &gt;&gt; because what IS HE DOING? WHY ARE WE STILL HERE, BROTHER JASON? NEARLY SEVEN DECADES. NEARLY SEVEN DECADES AFTER THE OPENING OF THE SEALS, GOING ON TOWARDS seven decades now, as fast as we can go. And you know, AND AND WHY WHY WHY IS ALL THIS STILL HAPPENING? AND I CAN TELL YOU IT'S BECAUSE HE'S STILL FILLING UP THE ROLE. &gt;&gt; There's still names THAT HAVE TO BE FOUND AND BROUGHT IN. AND I JUST SAY, "Let's go find them." &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; it's not a It's not a I I I don't need to I I mean, I IT'S NOT ABOUT ME DECIDING WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT HERE WITH on the streets with an evangelistic appeal that just brings in, you know, CASTING A BIG GOSPEL NET LIKE THEY DID BACK IN THE DAY WHEN THE when the ponds were filled with fish AND BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THE PONDS HAVE ALL BEEN SANE DRIED. NOW IT'S JUST ONE HERE AND ONE THERE and one here and one there. I'm not looking to to put I'M NOT LOOKING TO PUT HUMANS IN these in any of these EMPTY SEATS WHO DON'T WHO AREN'T LOVERS OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; SEE, I BECAUSE I'M I'M AWARE WHY YOU SAY, "WELL, DON'T WE NEED TO AT LEAST TRY?" HERE'S WHAT I KNOW. THE BIBLE TAUGHT FROM THE EARLIEST CHURCH AGE, WHICH MEANS IT'S STILL THE ORDER FOR TODAY. IT'S THE STANDARD. IS THAT GOD ADDS SEVERALLY TO THE CHURCH SUCH AS he will. Yes. &gt;&gt; SEE, &gt;&gt; SO WE GO OUT AND WE EVANGELIZE. WE GO OUT AND WE DO MISSIONARY WORK. We've done it. We still do it. We come up with inventive IDEAS OF HOW TO HOLD OUTREACH HERE AND OUTREACH THERE. WE'VE DONE IT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I'M NOT GOING TO ABANDON THE PRIMARY FOCUS AND THE PRIME DIRECTIVE of me as A MESSAGE PASTOR TO INSTILL IN YOU THE WORD OF GOD TO BRING YOU TO RAPTURING FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO BRING THE SLEEPING SAINTS OUT OF THE GROUND. THAT'S MY PRIMARY FOCUS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SEE, so we CAN'T GET THAT OUT OF BALANCE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; SO, SO WE DO APPEAL TO ALL and we're we're on the internet and we do outdoor activities. WE'VE DONE THEM GALORE. BUT at the end of the day, WE HAVE PROVEN OVER OVER 30 YEARS, YOU KNOW, UM IN PASTORING FOR 30 YEARS THAT GOD ADDS TO THE CHURCH SEVERALLY AS HE WILL. &gt;&gt; And he gifts severally as he will. And he uses those gifts severally as he will. BUT HIS EYES RUN TO AND FRO THROUGHOUT THE EARTH LOOKING FOR ANYONE WHO'LL BELIEVE HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; I'm a believer. So it's it becomes almost A SOMETIMES A QUESTION, YOU KNOW, HAS IT has it mattered? I mean, WE WE HAD A PROPHET HERE AND SUCH WONDERFUL MEETINGS and revival and went around the world and and SOMETIMES WE WANT TO LIVE IN YESTER YEAR AND SAY, "OH, IF WE COULD JUST HAVE THAT DISCERNMENT BACK, we could prove to the world and shut all their mouths." A PROPHET DID THAT AROUND THE WORLD SEVEN TIMES. And you can HEAR ON THE TAPE AND THEY WOULD REJOICE AND SCREAM HALLELUJAH AND PANDEMONIUM and would BREAK OUT IN DIVINE MIRACLES ON A ON A ON NEXT LEVEL scale &gt;&gt; things that hadn't BEEN SEEN. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM COULD record in A SINGLE MEETING OVER 33 YEARS OF MINISTRY, SEVEN TIMES AROUND THE WORLD. And he often recorded in a single service MORE MIRACLES THAN ARE RECORDED IN THE ENTIRE BIBLE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, HE MY WIFE AND I, WE WERE JUST LISTENING YESTERDAY um to a sermon and and Brother Brandham comes to a PRAYER LINE AND HE STARTS TO TALK TO A WOMAN AND HE JUST ALMOST FREEZES and he goes, "Now, don't you do that." He said, "Don't you dare. You better not do that. That thing you're thinking about doing, don't you better not do that." &gt;&gt; And that woman breaks down and starts weeping. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. THIS WAS THIS WAS SO CONFIRMED. WE DON'T NEED TO ARGUE ABOUT IT. I DON'T NEED TO DEFEND IT. MY LIFE IS A DEFENSE of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That it went around the world, that it OPERATED PERFECTLY. IT GOES WITH ALMOST THAT'S JUST A FOREGONE CONCLUSION. AND THE WORLD IS A UNDENIABLE WITNESS TO IT. &gt;&gt; TENS OF THOUSANDS WITNESS IT. I DON'T NEED TO ARGUE OR PROVE ANYTHING TO SOMEONE. I KNOW WHAT IT'S DONE IN MY LIFE. I SEE WHAT IT'S DOING IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THEN THAT PASSED AWAY. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, WE GO INTO THE 70S and and the the turmoil that the bride went through globally and it makes sense TO US NOW BECAUSE WE WERE JUST CHILDREN. SHE WAS AN INFANT BRIDE and when the seals are open and she grows through her adolescence and sometimes YOU KNOW TEENAGERS DON'T ALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING. THEY DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIMES THEY ARE SMARTER THAN THEIR PARENTS but they don't have enough life experience to know how to operate. So teenagers, you need to listen to your parents because THEY YOU MIGHT BE ACTUALLY SMARTER. ALL THREE OF MY BOYS ARE PROBABLY SMARTER THAN ME, BUT I GOT MORE LIFE experience &gt;&gt; to SAY, "SON, I TRIED THAT." I REMEMBER BROTHER EDDIE, I would I WAS ALWAYS THE KIND TO come in ON THE JOB AND GO, "DAD, WHY ARE WE DOING IT THIS WAY? WE SHOULD DO IT THIS WAY." AND bring this ladder over HERE AND SET THIS BUCKET. FINALLY, Brother Eddie just had enough of one day and he just he just did that wave of the hand that he always does. Son, anything you can think of, I've already tried. [laughter] I didn't even have a response. And I'm usually have a response. I didn't even know what to say. I just turned away and bowed my head and went to do what he told me. I never challenged him again. And I and I saw that I saw that as I began to gain painting experience that, you know, there there you don't always try to fix something that ain't broke. And so, SO WE FIND THAT, you know, and then and then in the 80S AND FINALLY JUST A JUST A LITTLE BIT OF historical perspective that I happen to have growing up raised up in it and growing up through it and tremendous wonderful deep revelations as the bride began to mature and and it wasn't happening in America. was happening abroad and overseas. And the bride was beginning to realize things like, "Wait a minute. The prophet said that the seventh angel is standing on the earth when the mighty one descends." And so, how is brother Brandham not here for the rapture? He must be going to come back and then the rapture. And we had all these ideas and it and and AS WE BEGIN TO COME INTO THE THROUGH THE LATE 70S, EARLY 80S, mid 80s, now men of God, great men OF GOD, I YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER MEN THAT I'VE BEEN ASSOCIATED with and some of our great warriors and generals who have already gone on uh to their reward and and I and I think of brother Bisl, I think of brother Howard Carroll, I think of of of brother Lonnie Jenkins and all these wonderful saints and pilgrims of the faith and brother Shrewsbury and different ones WHO HAD SUCH A LIVING testimony and and and you know we we we thought I remember I remember one time I was in a meeting in Colombia. Uh brother Hughes had put it on and he had rented a a large auditorium. This was way before the days of the internet, you know, when when everybody could just have their own private viewing of all the meetings around the world. And this is where you could it was no problem if you bring in the a minister and seat 12,000 12 I mean a,000 or,200 or 1500 people. THAT WASN'T UNCOMMON. STILL NOT UNCOMMON IN Africa and India and places like that. But America, we've just heard too much, brother Brandham said. SO A LOT OF TIMES YOU CAN'T EVEN GET PEOPLE TO COME REGULARLY TO CHURCH to say nothing of meetings. AND SO SO I REMEMBER IN A MEETING THERE IN,001,200 PEOPLE AND brother Ed was preaching and and and he JUST HE JUST MADE A STATEMENT and he HE WAS TALKING ABOUT UH Joseph and and HIS GENTILE WIFE Azenath and how that that she had to be dismissed to THE PALACE WHILE HE MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO his brethren, &gt;&gt; WHICH WE KNOW IS THE GOSPEL GOING BACK TO THE JEWS. AND AT THIS TIME SO MANY THINGS WERE HAPPENING IN ISRAEL and the the the the you know the Berlin wall had had come HAD YOU KNOW WAS GETTING READY TO COLLAPSE AND COMMUNISM WAS GOING TO RETREAT AND the east WAS GOING TO JOIN BACK TO THE WEST AND THESE WERE THESE WERE CLIMACTIC EVENTS THAT WE WERE JUST LIKE WOW YOU KNOW AND AND AND I AND I REMEMBER BROTHER ED JUST REFERENCED THE THE THINGS THAT WE COULD SEE IN THE news and he just said he said HE SAID I CAN TELL YOU THAT IF THIS IS THAT THAT IT'S THE TIME FOR GOD TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN TO HIS BRETHREN. HE SAID, "THEN I CAN TELL YOU FOR SURE, WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO THE PALACE." &gt;&gt; AND THAT just went OUT ACROSS THAT THING. I CAME TO MYSELF OUT IN THE AISLE STANDING UP SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS. PANDEMONIUM BROKE OUT. PEOPLE WERE FALLING AND FAINTING AND SCREAMING. A CRESCENDO OF SHOUT BECAUSE THE BRIDE SUDDENLY IT WAS REAL. WE'RE REALLY GOING HOME. AND THEN I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THE THE GREAT SERMONS THAT BEGAN TO COME FROM THOSE GREAT ministries and the 10 years that I was privileged to travel around the world with brother Lonnie and learn AT HIS FEET MANY things and sitting MANY TIMES ONE TWO IN THE MORNING at his feet and me and him talking WITH OUR BIBLES OPEN DISCUSSING THIS DISCUSSING THAT AND YOU KNOW ME HIM GIVING ME LOTS OF POINTS FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT IT ME GIVING HIM A FEW OF MY POINTS FOR HIM TO THINK ABOUT AND IT IT WAS SUCH A A WONDERFUL FRIENDSHIP THAT WE HAD. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HIM AGAIN. BUT, you know, WE WE THOUGHT THAT THAT THAT THOSE THINGS YOU SAY, WELL, DID they did they even matter. I mean, we thought we were going and that was the late 80s. And then we thought for sure the early 90s and the Russians have retreated and the Berlin Wall has come down. We must be going home. And then then the mid 90s and then I came here to pastor and then the late 90s and and then we TURNED INTO AND NO WAY COULD we go into a new millennium until we did. No way we could hit a hit the 21ST CENTURY UNTIL WE ARE NOW 25 YEARS DEEP INTO THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY HAS IT MATTERED? I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED mattered &gt;&gt; when Jesus told the disciples, "Go into Jerusalem and you're going to go down a certain street, turn this, go this way, and you're going to find a colt tied and untie loose him and bring him to me. AND IF ANYBODY ASKS you what what are you doing reloosing my cult, just say the master hath need of him and they'll give you leave." And the disciples, here they go. They don't even realize. They turned a corner and suddenly they just stepped into a vision. They don't know. It's just the same day it was before they turned the corner and there's the colt and there's the rope and here's somebody asking and they're loosing and THE WHOLE THING NOW THAT WASN'T GOLTHA THAT WASN'T GETHSEMANE that wasn't Pilot's judgment hall that WASN'T RESURRECTION MORNING BUT it mattered &gt;&gt; it mattered &gt;&gt; because he HAD TO COME RIDING INTO JERUSALEM ON THAT ANIMAL &gt;&gt; SO I'M HERE TO TELL YOU LISTEN FRIENDS IT JOSEPH COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW IS HE HATED OF HIS BROTHERS HE BROTHER SAID HE COULDN'T HELP BEING SPIRITUAL THEY'RE REJECTING HIM. THEY'RE PERSECUTING HIM. THEY CAST HIM INTO A HOLE. THEY TRY TO KILL HIM. THEY SELL HIM. HE GOES INTO SLAVERY. FALSE ACCUSED. GOES INTO PRISON. YOU THINK HE WANTED TO BE IN PRISON? HE DON'T WANT TO BE IN PRISON. HE WASN'T DOWN THERE. YOU KNOW, UH, YOU KNOW, he loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me not. It had nothing to do WITH THAT. JOSEPH WANTED OUT. HE SAID TO THE BUTCHER AND THE BAKER, "LISTEN, WHEN YOU GET IN FRONT OF PHARAOH, DON'T FORGET ME." &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE THERE. LOTS OF THINGS WE'RE ENCOUNTERING, WE DON'T SAY, "I WISH I HADN'T HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT." IT MATTERED. OUR TRIALS, OUR UPS AND DOWNS. YOU SAY, "BUT A LOT OF THEM I FAILED." BUT EVEN THAT MATTERED BECAUSE YOU REPENTED AND YOU'RE STILL HERE &gt;&gt; AND AND THEY'RE SHAKING AROUND THE WORLD, BUT WE'RE STILL PRESSING THE BATTLE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IT ALL MATTERED. &gt;&gt; IT MATTERED ON WHEN ELIJAH WAS ON CARMEL &gt;&gt; and he PROVED WHO THE TRUE GOD WAS AND SLEW ALL THOSE PROPHETS. AND YOU SAY, "YEAH, BUT THEN HE HAD TO RUN FOR HIS LIFE. IT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER BECAUSE JEZEBEL STILL TRIED TO KILL HIM. IT DIDN'T CONVERT THE GOVERNMENT. ISRAEL STILL BACKSLID. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IT MATTERED FOR 7,000 WHO HAD NOT BOWED THE KNEE TO BAAL. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WORLD IS DOING. I KNOW BY THE BOOK OF REVELATION, IT'S GOING INTO THE ABYSS AND HEADED TO JACOB'S TROUBLE. BUT I PLAN TO LEAVE HERE IN A THIRD EXODUS. AND I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE STILL HERE ONE DECADE, TWO DECADES, THREE DECADES, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, MOVING ON SEVEN. BUT [screaming] IT'S ALL MATTERED. IT'S ALL MATTERED. IT'S ALL IT'S ALL IMPORTANT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY I HAD THIS UP OR THAT DOWN, THIS WEAKNESS, THAT FAILURE, THIS TRIAL THAT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, SOMETIMES WE'VE WALKED INTO THE DEEPEST, DARKEST trials like Joseph. I mean, your whole life before Christ was a dark trial. People are so in such revalry of how drunk they can get, how many parties and what's their body count and all OF THIS KIND OF STUFF AND LIVING IT UP AND just not aware at all that their candle is burning down &gt;&gt; every 24 hours. AND YOU KNOW, sometimes people go through dark trials and hard blows, hard blows, and they they they leave it as a scar. &gt;&gt; What's the what's the point of that? ALL IF YOU LIVE IN THAT SCAR, ALL THAT'S GOING TO DO IS STUNT YOUR GROWTH, &gt;&gt; PUT YOU IN A LOCKED DOWN POSITION AND YOU'LL GO AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS, COMPLAINING ABOUT THAT, AND YOU'LL NEVER BE THE KIND OF SAVIOR. I WOULD JUST SAY TO YOU TODAY, COME OUT OF THAT TRAFFIC CIRCLE. COME UP OUT OF THAT DUNGEON. LIFT UP YOUR HEAD. LET THE SUNLIGHT BREAK THROUGH. LIFT UP YOUR HEART. LIFT UP. JESUS SAID, "LOOK UP. YOUR REDEMPTION DRAWETH NIGH." WALK OUT OF THAT THING, FRIENDS. MOVE ON. THERE'S NO VALUE IN STAYING BACK THERE UNDER THAT THING. IT CAN'T HELP YOU. ALL IT CAN DO IS HURT YOU AND POISON THOSE AROUND YOU. GOD HAS CALLED US TO LIBERTY AND TO FREEDOM IN THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; I COULD LAMENT EVERY FAILURE I HAVE, BUT I I CONCENTRATE RATHER ON HOW MANY TIMES I REPENTED, HOW MANY TIMES HE FORGAVE ME, HOW MANY TIMES I WALKED OUT AND INTO THE SUNLIGHT AND A TRIAL WAS OVER AND A WEAKNESS WAS OVER AND I NEVER HAD TO GO BACK TO THAT PRISON AGAIN. &gt;&gt; THESE THINGS MATTER. THEY ALL MATTERED. EVERYTHING WE'VE ENDURED MATTERS. SOMETIMES IF YOU TRY TO SUGGEST EVEN FOR A MOMENT, OH, this thing will never end. This trial, this weakness, THIS STUMBLE, THIS CONSEQUENCE. I want you to know something, friends. It will end. &gt;&gt; They will end. &gt;&gt; They must end. God will make them end. &gt;&gt; And we are looking at a day just ahead of us. Oh, hallelujah. Our future is unstoppably bright. Our future there there there is a new day dawning a new DAY OF ETERNITY. OH, AND I I I DON'T KNOW. WE MAY NOT BE BURNING UP THE WORLD LIKE BROTHER BRANDHAM DID, BUT I'M I'M QUIETLY MARCHING TO ZION. And every day I just TAKE ANOTHER STEP. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TOMORROW? I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER STEP. OR WHAT IF THIS HAPPENS? I'LL JUST KEEP TAKING A STEP. I MIGHT GO IN IT AND I'LL STEP THROUGH IT AND STEP OUT OF IT AND AND I MIGHT FACE ANOTHER ONE, BUT SOMEDAY I'LL STEP LIKE ENOCH. I'LL STEP INTO ANOTHER REALM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M DETERMINED TO SERVE HIM. I'M DETERMINED TO SERVE HIM. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER COME WHAT MAY, I I'M HERE TO TELL YOU FRIENDS, IT IT IT WE WE SEE HOW IT ALL PLAYS OUT. AND I DON'T I don't I don't plan to [gasps] I don't plan to think uh we're going to meet under a bridge &gt;&gt; or we're all going to GATHER IN SOME GINORMOUS CATHEDRAL THAT'S GOING TO hold the entire bride around the world. At least not in this dimension. &gt;&gt; IF WE GOT ONE COMING IN ANOTHER DIMENSION, I'LL BE ON THE FRONT ROW. I PROMISE YOU THAT. I'm not going to MISS IT. I WOULDN'T MISS HEAVEN FOR THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; Would you? AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU WOULDN'T MISS HEAVEN FOR THE WORLD, WOULD YOU? &gt;&gt; OH MY GOODNESS, FRIENDS. MY DAILY goal is to do the will of God for my life to complete my mission. I say as Paul said in the book of Hebrews concerning Christ, it is written of me in the scrolls concerning me, I have come to do thy will, O Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "I had this setback. You just don't know what I've been through." You don't know what I've been through. &gt;&gt; You don't know what the person beside you's been through. &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe they just have gotten more victory while you're still crying in a puddle. &gt;&gt; And I'm not I'm NOT MINIMIZING YOUR LOSS or your trial. I've had some deep losses, deep trials, &gt;&gt; things that would be regrettable, things that a lot of times I visited on my own self. And and BUT BUT BUT REGARDLESS OF OF WHAT I DID TO MYSELF OR GOD ALLOW THE DEVIL TO DO LIKE HE DID Israel for correction, REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED, I'M NOT GOING TO STAY STUCK. I'M NOT COME ON, FRIENDS. DON'T STAY STUCK IN THAT. THAT THING WILL JUST LOCK YOU DOWN. YOU'LL HAVE SPIRITUAL AMNESIA. YOU'LL LOSE YOUR SPIRITUAL IDENTITY. WE'RE HERE TO BE SAVIORS TO THE WORLD EVERY 24 HOURS. LISTEN, YOU YOU MAY HAVE HAD YOU MAY HAVE HAD MANY DISCOURAGEMENTS, BUT I COULD JUST SAY TO YOU TODAY, IF YOU COULD TALK TO JOSEPH AND SAY, "WAS ALL OF THOSE DISCOURAGEMENTS WORTH IT?" HE WOULD SAY, "YES, EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM WAS WORTH IT." AND IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO UNDERSTAND IT. IT SEEMED BAD. IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE. AND LATER ON, I BEGAN TO REALIZE WHAT YOU THOUGHT, WHAT THE DEVIL THOUGHT FOR EVIL, GOD [screaming] THOUGHT IT FOR MY GOOD. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. EVERY 24 HOURS, LUCIFER IS THAT MUCH CLOSER TO FAILURE. AND EVERY 24 HOURS, I'M THAT MUCH CLOSER TO THE RESURRECTION. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THE VISION IS YET FOR AN APPOINTED TIME, BUT AT [screaming] THE END IT SHALL SPEAK AND NOT LIE. THOUGH IT TAR, WAIT FOR IT, BECAUSE IT SURELY WILL COME. LUCIFER'S CLAIM WILL FAIL. IT MUST FAIL. IT IS FAILING. HALLELUJAH. I'M HERE TO BE A LIVING REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT GOD SAID THAT I WILL DWELL WITH MY PEOPLE &gt;&gt; AND I'LL HAVE A NEW HEAVENS AND A NEW EARTH. AND I JUST SAY BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. LET MY LIFE NOT STAY SILENT. [screaming] LET MY LIFE BE A LIVING blast &gt;&gt; to the WORLD AROUND ME. STAND. GOD BLESS YOU. STAND.
