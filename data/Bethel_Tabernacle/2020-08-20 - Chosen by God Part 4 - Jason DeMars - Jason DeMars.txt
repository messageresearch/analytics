that's where the Jason comes above all power but walking [Music] above all nature and all creative things above all wisdom in all the ways of man you were here before the world began above all Kingdom of all Thrones [Music] and Treasures of the Earth there's no way to measure what your word [Music] [Applause] [Music] rejected [Music] on the ground [Music] thought of me above [Music] I lay behind the storms rejected [Music] to fall and thought of me above [Music] trampled on the ground [Music] as it's written The Riches of your grace not just merely Your Grace but it's it's so it's so rich it's so overflowing it's so abundant to us Lord and we're so thankful for that Lord even when we when we sin Your Grace abounds not that we desire to walk in sin and live in sin Lord but it's the reality of the nature that lies within us there's there's still sin there and we do sin but it's your grace oh God that's abounding keeping us preserving us protecting us [Music] and empowering us Lord It's Your goodness that leads us to repentance so I pray Lord that you would just fill us with your grace We Know Your Grace isn't merely Mercy Lord but there's a great Supernatural empowering that comes by your grace Lord let it abound to us more and more we commit the service and the word of God into your hands we ask that your anointing would come forth upon each one of us to accomplish that which you so desire in every Heart Lord to those who are hurting those who are maybe feeling down lord would you just lift their hearts up encourage them strengthen them Lord give a bring a healing balm through your word just commit ourselves to your Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated I'm going to start out with a brief missions report just a little update um so this is brother Omid with his family his wife sister sanes and their daughter Andia there he's the pastor in kaiseri turkey and he's the one we've had several prayer requests about in the past um just regarding his uh immigration situation just if you haven't heard I'll just give you a brief understanding of it brother Omid was uh in Iran was arrested and he he was tried and convicted of crimes against National Security in in their country basically he was a Christian and and converted from Islam so he was sentenced to five years before they arrested him he fled the country and then probably a year later his wife joined him in Turkey he's been in Turkey now for seven years and um they've gone through this Refugee process and it's now in the hands of the Turkish government it used to be in the hands of the U.N he was approved by the U.N and was set to come to the United States until our immigration program completely changed with the new Administration that came in and so he's been kind of stuck there ever since and as a result the Turkish government took over immigration cases thank you and they've been uh basically just denying the the refugee cases and so there are of course cases that people aren't really under persecution they're just fleeing for economic reasons but omitus genuinely was persecuted and if he were to return to Iran it would be long-term prison sentence and torture a very very difficult to uh circumstances for him if he were to be brought back there so they canceled his immigration process canceled his um all of his documents his identification Insurance everything so his wife has a heart condition and different things it was miraculous that their daughter was born and she was perfectly fine but no insurance for them so they're facing a lot of difficulties also always before them is are the police going to come just pick me up and put me on an airplane to go back to Iran by God's grace brother nehemiah's Church in Canada has been willing to help and sponsor him to to come to Canada they have a little bit less stringent immigration policies there so they're going to go through that process on the meantime he needs he's gotten an attorney uh in in Turkey as well that's helping them to try to get uh go to the court and get his identification and insurance restored but it's a huge time of stress he can't leave that City so that's also difficult a difficulty on my end because he's my translator so if I if I were to go to Turkey I basically would just be there with him in that City um for now so and I may do that this fall seeking the will of the Lord if you want to go to the next one this is Brother Petros he is Iranian but he lives in Hamburg Germany now he was just recently I believe it was in through the month of July the whole month he was in Turkey visiting several cities and churches there mostly he was just doing visiting people one-on-one because they were still they still did not have their serve the ability to do their open up their services again so he was just meeting people at coffee shops and restaurants and um at people's homes and uh event went very well but he's I think he's still on because he had to fly back to Germany he's still on quarantine now should be coming out in a couple days being able to come out of quarantine in Germany um from what it sounds like in Turkey they have all kinds of rules in place about wear a mask do this but nobody follows them and they're not really enforcing forcing them it's just I think it's mostly just so they can tell the International Community oh yeah we have mandatory masks oh yeah we we on our flights everybody has to wear a mask but the reality is no one's enforcing it but Germany is more strict and so he's had to stay in quarantine for quite a while and that's been pretty difficult on him um go to the next one this is brother megaly there with holding the microphone he's uh Pastor in Cairo Egypt and they they didn't have Services I think from March middle of March through just um just recently last week they had their first service last last Thursday so they're really excited to have that you can go to the next screen I think that show some of the people there um keep them in prayer we're continuing to work on getting the Supernatural series printed it's all translated now getting edited it'll all be printed there and I think go to the next one oh boy that not all the words came through go to the next one uh yeah back to that one with the David Livingstone just I wanted to give a few inspiring missionary quotes to you but I guess I I the Lord worked it out that I would just be giving you one so David Livingstone if you remember him he went into the heart of Africa and faced all kinds of difficulties and trials there but this was one of his quotes and I it was it's inspiring to me touched me sympathy is no substitute for action you know the great the Great Commission is not an option for us to consider but it's a command to be obeyed and sympathizing with the Great Commission is no substitute for taking action and being obedient to the Lord and sharing your faith with others so I think uh we're gonna go to the other um PowerPoint I'm wondering if it's going to be cut off so we may need to pull that up Just Right In PowerPoint but with that said we're going to turn in the scripture as he's pulling that up we're going to look at Jude 1 verse 4. great let's stand up as we read for there are certain men crept in unawares where before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ and the next scripture is second Peter 3 verse 9. the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but all that all should come to repentance amen and if you just want to blank that screen out for me for the Joel you can be seated so just a reminder this is chosen by God as my subject and this is part four I'm sure everyone has perfect recall on part one two and three foreign not even I do so I'm sure you don't we'll spend some time reviewing a few things but uh in this particular one I want to speak about um something we would call Double predestination that's what we'll start out with and then we'll start then we'll look at eternal security and perseverance of the Saints so those two subjects are really closely tied together of course they all are dealing with predestination and election but um if you want to bring up that quote God will not take as anointed and you cannot impersonate that office God anoints he chooses who he Wills he condemns who he Wills it's God that does the justifying it's God that does the choosing and he raises it up go ahead go ahead and I'll blank that out again so when we're looking at these scriptures we see that God from all eternity elects some to Salvation and some to condemnation and this is a this is a teaching that the human flesh the human will the human reasoning doesn't appreciate doesn't enjoy it rubs up against our Notions of justice and fairness unfortunately our nose Notions of justice and fairness are perverted by our lack of understanding of scripture by by the very nature that we have within us that we're born with and so as that's why the Bible says we need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind you know we don't just come into this as as believers who are born again of the spirit and we just understand everything and we're okay with everything we have to go through a cleansing process and that's in our that starts in our mind our mind as our mind is renewed then our heart our heart follows suit you know our our emotions are reasoning our imagination our conscience those five inlets when we're born of the spirit of God he begins to take control from the soul and little by little our mind is transformed but God does choose from all eternity some to Salvation some to condemnation he has Mercy on some and the Bible says on some he hardens them but I want to think about this the work that God does in doing that is not the same for both I want to explain that God positively works Grace within the heart of the elect he called he calls them he justifies them he glorifies them you know that's God's positive will his action towards us to change us but then on the other side God actually serves Justice to us he he he's not unjust to us he simply gives Mercy to us but to those the those we would call The Condemned or the reprobate he simply leaves them to Justice he leaves them to his uh his just Wrath he gives them what they deserve for the non-elect he get he he leaves them to their fallen nature now you know people look at that and say well God hardened Pharaoh's heart God's now responsible for sin you'll you'll hear that said many times I heard it in philosophy classes theology classes people that do not believe in predestination want to prove that your point is wrong about predestination God hardens Pharaoh's heart therefore God is responsible for working evil inside of pharaoh not true he leaves them to Divine Justice they themselves already have a hard heart you're we're all born with a hard heart we don't have to work ourselves into a hard heart it's just there that's the nature we're born with that's what Adam passed on to all of us and so he leaves them just to Divine justice but I want to know I want you to notice Romans 1 18. through 32 speak of it I'm not going to go into detail just there's so many scriptures that I have to cover tonight but in verse 24 it says that God surrenders them to impurity he surrenders them to impurity why they already had impurity and so he's he sees they're continuing in impurity they don't they don't see my deity manifested in creation all around them they don't receive the Gospel they're rejecting it therefore God sees that and he surrenders them now up to that point in time perhaps God was had a restraining Grace upon them to prevent them from going any further but in that point in time it says God gives them over to the lusts of Their Own Heart in other words he surrenders them he says I take my hands off I'm giving you over to impurity through what the scripture says through the lusts of your own heart and through the desires of their hearts so what is God simply doing he's saying I take my hands off so Pharaoh's heart was already hardened God hardened his heart further how he stopped restraining pharaoh he just let him go and and the increase of his heart went continually to hardening and hardening and hardening the elector given Grace the reprobate are given Justice and they're left to live in their own sinful and hardened nature so that you know that's really God you know God is not under any obligation to give us Mercy he doesn't have to give Mercy to anyone no one has ever been the victim of Injustice with God no one has ever been God is perfectly just perfectly holy he's full of grace he's full of Mercy as the scripture says he's not willing that any should perish but I want you to notice what he says he's long-suffering to who it doesn't say to everyone Peter says he's long suffering to us word he's long-suffering to the elect he's not willing that any of the elect elect should perish but that all should come to repentance again God doesn't have God isn't obligated to anyone we we have never done anything that we need to God needs to repay us everything that we have belongs to God everything that is on this Earth belongs to him there's nothing that's outside of his control outside of what belongs there's nothing that doesn't belong to him already we can't get we can't give to God something that he didn't first give to us so he died he doesn't owe us anything we owe him everything and he's always perfectly just Ephesians if you want to pull up that um scripture Ephesians 1 verse 13 and 14. in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchase possession unto the praise of his glory in the next scripture and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until unto the day of redemption so the the receiving of the Holy Ghost the true genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost which brings the new birth is the down payment from God of our inheritance what is our inheritance a new body a new world ruling and reigning with Christ so do you think God can give a down payment and then change his mind the Bible says God never repents am I a man that I should repent or the son of man that I should lie God never repents God never changes his mind God Malachi 3 it says I am God and I change not so if God gives a down payment to to you and I he'll never change his mind and he will bring you to the Redemption of the purchase possession why will he bring you to that place of the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory God takes his glory very very seriously it's at the very center of everything that he does so you think that God is going to lose you somehow it's who he is it reflects upon him his life his his purpose if he loses you he's no longer omnipotent and we're sealed until that the day of redemption there's a there's there's a purchase price been paid and there's nothing going to stop God from doing it in you if you want to pull up that quote Jesus said all the father has given me will come to me and no man can come to me except the father draws him all that comes to me I'll give them eternal life and raise him up at the last day there's none of them lost I lose nothing because no man can can pluck them out of my father's hand who gave them to me next one oh my Saint John 5 24 he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life and shall never come to the Judgment but has passed from Death To Life that's why this church believes in the security of the believer well you say now brother Branham I guess once in Grace always in grace that brings a lot of disgrace but when a man or woman is born of the spirit of God old things have passed away all things have become new next one do you mean to tell me that a God the infinite God would come down and give you eternal life knowing that he was going to lose you savior here knowing he's always going to lose you there what did he save you for why he's working against himself next one now the infinite God who could tell the end from the beginning and the Savior here this week annoying next year you're going to backslide and lose you next one okay black that out it's got It's God's purpose and plan to preserve you to the end and we'll see we'll see that we'll look at that more closely as we go forward that there's a it's not just as brother Jason said on Sunday God is not just pushing you through a pipe on one end saying oh nice job you overcame no that's that's not it and yet God has us God has promises for us and he also has conditions that are put in the scripture that need to be in our life so I mean it goes along with faith and works if you have genuine faith and genuine faith is not something you worked yourself into you're incapable of it genuine faith is a gift given by almighty God to you it's him giving a revelation which causes you to believe so when he does that by his grace do you think he's going to change his mind pull it away from you pull out the rug when he gives a genuine revelation of faith that stays there no matter what and that produces something in your life if you have something produced in your life which is his life the fruit of the spirit the character of Jesus Christ it's a evidence that you're born again that you that you have genuine faith salvation produces a life lived like Jesus Christ let's look at the scripture Psalm 97 verse 10 ye that love the Lord hate evil he preserveth The Souls of his Saints he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked I don't see any qualify qualifications there it says he does it he preserves our souls he delivers us out of the hand of the of the evil one it's his work it's his purpose next one Psalm Psalms 34 22 the Lord redeems The Souls of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate you're not gonna God is Not Gonna Leave You Alone he's not going to abandon you he'll it's his promise I'll be with you always even to the end of the world Hebrews 7 25 wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them to save them to the uttermost aren't you thankful that it says to the uttermost to the Very extreme all the way to the end he is able has nothing to do with you you're just the one he's doing it too and doing it for you you brothers and sisters you say I know this already this needs to be in your soul when you're at work when you're struggling when you're depressed whenever Satan has every gun aimed at you this can't be just something you heard one time this has to be the sustenance that keeps your soul this is God's promise don't let it just be a Doctrine over here that we believe in our church this is the lifeblood that's going to keep you that's that when every storm of Life am I really saved while I remember that I never chose it in the first place God came to me saved me gave me a spirit changed me so therefore it has nothing to do with what I'm seeing or experiencing or feeling it's all about what he's already done and what he's going to continue to do Romans 11 29. for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance has God called you to himself he's never going to change his mind he's never going to turn around from that Jude 1 24 now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy he's able to keep you from falling is anything that you do able to overpower almighty God if you're born of the spirit of God his hand is on you he's given you Faith by a revelation no matter what happens he's going to keep you from falling you say I've seen people fall David in in the Old Testament they're under the Old Testament this is something the New Covenant is better and greater that's what the book of Hebrews says yes Abraham had his brother he was elect Abraham lied was dishonest that's not our that's not our example Abraham his life is an example to us of Faith but we're not to live like Abraham and lie or David and commit adultery and say well God's just going to keep me that's that's an evidence that your heart's not right in the first place God gives you a heart he gives you in the New Covenant it's a new heart there's something higher we're called to a higher life than Old Testament Saints you know what what did they say what do they say about John the Baptist there's no one no greater Prophet than him yet the one in the Kingdom of Heaven the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than John it's shocking to think about but the reality is the New Covenant is something that it it wasn't under the old it's new there's something you and I have the the New Birth by the baptism of the holy ghost that comes through the blood of Jesus Christ at Calvary they didn't have they never experienced we're called to something higher don't live such a life and say well Abraham was a liar so I can be a liar David was adulterer so I'm justified in what I'm doing hey you think it's funny because it's ridiculous but how many so-called preachers of this message have used the same nonsense reasoning to manipulate control people why am I telling this to you because you you can tell very quickly who is serving God and who is not serving God who is serving themselves using you to serve themselves the spirit of God does not lead people into an adultery doesn't lead people into lying you you might say something that's not true to someone you'll be convicted and you'll make it right and it'll bring a greater testimony just like brother Diggs was speaking about before brother Branham had his mistakes he told his wife to lie he lied what it what was it God convicted him he went back and told the man and apologized and it was a greater testimony I've personally experienced exactly the same thing but what but what is it the spirit of God works conviction that's him keeping you but you're not going to make excuses for it if you're making an excuse for your sin continuing to live in it damaging people's lives it shows you've got to repent you've got to get filled with the spirit of God he is able to keep pull that up again that script same scripture to him that is able to keep you from falling last one and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory what does it does it say that you're doing some of that he's doing it for you he keeps you from falling and he presents you faultless before his presence it's his work it's what he's doing is what he's accomplishing now this next scripture Hebrews 6 um is one that is always brought to meet is there verse 4 there yeah so this one is always brought as a question especially overseas when you're preaching on predestination and eternal security and they bring this and want to want to show you see your doctrine of eternal security is incorrect these people that are Falling Away let's read it for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away so there's that word Falling Away falling away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of God afresh and put him to an open shame next scriptures so if you just read those ones those scriptures seems like an open and shut case people can get enlightened receive the Holy Ghost and then they can fall away backslide and they'll never be able to be renewed to repentance again but let's look at seven through nine and I apologize it seems like uh these are getting cut outs a lot of the scriptures are getting cut off I don't know if while I taking a break between them you can switch over to the PowerPoint um but we're going to read seven through nine and then we'll take I'll have you shut it down there for a minute for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off to upon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed receives blessing from God but that which Bears thorns and Briars is rejected and is Nyan de cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak so now we have Paul writing and he's giving the bigger picture so first he says these people they're they're enlightened they've tasted the good word of God they made partakers of the Holy Ghost but then he wants to give a bigger picture and he begins to speak about two types of plants he speaks of herbs which are meat for them to whom it is dressed so the herbs receive water but also thorns and Briars receive water they both receive water but they bear different kinds of fruit one's purpose is to receive blessing from God the other's purpose their end is to be burned and he says but beloved we are persuaded of better things of you and things which accompany things which go along things which are produced by salvation even though we speak like this so what is what is Paul saying here back up these are people that were in the church they made their confession they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by all appearances they were walking with God they were living for him but Paul is trying to give a bigger picture and say there's two different kinds of seeds one seed is from God one seed is from the evil one now this is the parable this is the outworking of Jesus parable in Matthew 13. and so they both ex can experience the Holy Ghost can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost can taste the word of God can preach the word of God but one is the seed of God one is the seed of the evil one and how do you know the difference what fruit is produced what what kind of Life what kind of word comes forth from their life second Peter 2 verse 20 through 22 I think we're in between bringing them up so if you want to turn there you're welcome to I'm going to read it for after half if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them but it has happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog has turned his own vomit again in the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire once again you see the the Apostle Peter explaining the big picture at the very end um and I'll just kind of Jump Ahead in first John 2 19 it says they went out from us but they weren't out of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be manifested that they were not all of us again John is acknowledging the fact there's people they come come to church they come and listen to the gospel they come and respond to the gospel they're baptized correctly and they seem to be living a Godly life but what happens the dog turns to his mom your nature it's your nature to do that so your nature will produce that they never had a nature change in the first place why are they walking away why are they leaving why are they it says after they escape the pollutions of the world what do they do they came they went through the process that everyone that's a Christian is supposed to do as a new believer they're attending Fellowship they're listening to the word of God but then what happens there the Bible says they're entangled again they're entangled therein again and they're overcome and their last and is worse than their their beginning so and it says they knew the way of righteousness they studied it they looked at it they knew it but then they turned from it why did they do it that was their nature they never they never really received the Holy Spirit John says they went out from us because they were not of us what is why does he say that you know any cult could use the same statement that John uses to prove their point what is he really trying to say in that is they they left they left the truth of God's word and the reality of Jesus Christ the only true way because they weren't elect they weren't predestinated unto this and it had to be manifested that they didn't have the same nature there Comes A manifesting Time when the true colors are shown Jesus goes through that through that Parable some leave me because they're the seed that fell by the wayside cares and Troubles of Life some by riches different circumstances in their life cause them to say I don't need the gospel anymore why outward experience it wasn't in a nature change in the Soul by the Holy Ghost it was simply an outward emotion that's why it's so important we have to move beyond the outward emotion and go beyond that and get in to that word that word in our heart to produce the life of Jesus Christ now there's no question that a true relationship with almighty God produces emotion it produces true reasoning it produces true imagination it produces something real inside and outside without a doubt but our Salvation isn't based on emotion it's deeper than that it's brother Branham says it's your heart in that word and that's Christ not emotions get the word in there first and then that will produce the other things we want every blessing from God we want the supernatural power of God we want his gifts we want healing we want shouting we want clapping we want rejoicing we want all of it but the real thing not a mimic because if it's just a mimic you're going to walk away you're going to leave be sure you have the real thing in your soul it will keep you it's like brother Branham those people ask brother Branham after he went through all that he did with his family and he's left alone and said did you keep your religion he said no no it kept me you know so let's look at this in a deeper way because if we just look and stare at these scriptures we could come to the place and say my maybe I really could lose my salvation but if we have to look at the big picture if you can lose your salvation true salvation I'm not saying a church membership Church attendance anybody can lose Church attendance I'm talking about genuine Holy Ghost salvation if you can lose that salvation then that salvation is contingent conditional upon you and me if we're just defiled and reconciled to God can we then turn around and become enemies again with God I want to remind you that doesn't say he loves me because I loved him I love him because he first loved me God made the approach to you and reconciled you do you think you're gonna all of a sudden do something that's going to cause God to become your enemy he didn't approach you because of what you did who or who you are he approached you because of his Sovereign choice his Sovereign purpose and whatever you do is not going to thwart that it's not going to change that he did the reconciling we didn't do the reconciling we didn't say oh please God be my friend again we were running while we were running from us he He Turned us around says no man can come to me unless the father draws him first you can't come to him no no one seeks after God it's God that does the seeking after man he's the one that came and got you he's the one that reconciled he's the one that started the process he's the one that will finish the process if salvation is conditional on our Behavior After experiencing it then it's no longer by grace and it's no longer a free gift It Is by works and is maintained by works salvation is a free gift to his elected and there's nothing that we could possibly do to change our position before God John 1 13 says we're not born of the will of the flesh or or of blood or of the will of man we are born of God we go back a little ways there brother Joe many are called but few are chosen many hear the call and even respond to it what was one of Jesus parables it was The Parables of the fish the different kinds of fish the net was thrown out it pulled in all kinds of fish some were good some weren't bad what was the net the Gospel of Jesus Christ the message of the hour it's thrown out it brings in all kinds of different fish but which ones did was the were the fishermen interested in the good fish so they're separated out the bad fish are thrown back the good fish are kept but there are those who for whatever reason listen to The Gospel hear respond to it and appear to live by it for a season but they bear thorns and Briars and they're made for the purpose of being burned they're not bearing good fruit Romans 5 10. for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life we were enemies of God and we were reconciled not by our own will not by our own works we were reconciled by the death of his son that's what brought the reconciliation he did not us we're just partakers of it we were experienced we're the ones that experience of it but then it says much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life so what does that mean to think about it we're saved by his life I thought we already were saved so we're it talks about reconciliation which reconciliation means making friend making two enemies into friends but then it speaks of Salvation so there's reconciliation and salvation in this sense it's looking at the experience that we have that we're going through and that we will ultimately experience complete salvation when we have a new body when this vile body is changed and likened unto his glorious body so what does that mean saved by his life well what is Jesus doing for us now he's the mediator of a better Covenant he's the high priest so how does God keep us through the ministry of the high priest you know what did Peter do at the very end there he betrayed Christ right Jesus said I have prayed for you that your faith would fail you not that's Christ the mediator standing in our place praying for us standing between us and God it's Christ that keeps us Hebrews 10 through 14. by the which will we are Sanctified for the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest stands daily ministering and offering offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he's perfected forever them that are Sanctified so how long are we perfected for as long as we are good as long as we don't sin as long as we don't fall away how long are we perfected for ever forever what is forever is not eternally right we know that so it's just for a space of time what is that space of time we looked at it before grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption so we're sealed and we're perfected Forever Until the time we have a new body and we're Immortal and completely sinless when we're when we're sinless in that Immortal body we don't need a high priest anymore we don't need a meat eater anymore he's accomplished exactly what he's need to accomplish then we with our King will return back to this earth to rule over it can we somehow be unperfected if it's God's decree God doesn't change his mind that Perfection stands and no nothing can change it as much as God ordained this to be next scripture he's also ordained a process for believers to go through Philippians 1 6 says being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ there's something that God has to perform in you he starts the good work in you and it has to be performed if there's no evidence of God performing something in your life then you've got to repent then you got to get filled with the Holy Ghost so that performance can be done and it isn't your performance it's something outside of your control outside of what you do it's someone that's omnipotent working in you a work that no one can thwart and no one can stop not even you there's one thing that we have brother Branham says in the Paradox message in 1965 he said we man always wants something into his salvation says you do have something into it the surrender of your will and your idea to the will and idea of almighty God it's surrender that's the part that we play it's saying I give myself to you Lord you work in me that which is needed and he will do it math uh next one um yeah you see God could not push us through a little pipe pull us out on the other end and then saying blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself I have to make decisions for myself in doing that we show our faith and respects to God amen he doesn't just push us through a pipe there is our involvement and it isn't our own works it's our surrender to him there's a continual surrender I don't know what world you're living and maybe you don't need to surrender every second but I've got to surrender myself every second every minute every hour Jesus the sinless perfect Son of God also had to surrender himself and say not my will that thy will be done the same the same goes for us to to Infinity next one he doesn't push us through a pipe but we are clay and he is the Potter and he does mold us and he does have power to mold us his brother Branham says this so if you ever want to pray for me it's not to have money not to have big homes or be popular but just pray that I can stay in the hands of Christ mold clay that he can mold me and use me in any way that he sees fit to do it I'll pray the same thing for you that you'll be the same way so no he doesn't push us through a pipe but yes he does mold the clay and I'm so grateful for that and our part is just submit submit to it we can we can resist we can we can block But ultimately God's going to have his way he'll do it the hard way or he'll do it the easy way regardless if he has his hand on his life on your life he has his way way of correcting of convicting and even even in those things where we do the wrong thing where we sin God has a purpose in that he's correcting us he's bringing those things out like brother Diggs was talking about God is bringing that little nature within us that's not right he's bringing that to the surface so that we can repent and make it right and get rid of that nasty thing that's in our life that's his Sovereign Grace he that began the work will be faithful to perform it until the day of Jesus Christ um is Matthew 15 verse 8 up there brother maybe that got missed I'll read it this people yeah go back go back to Matthew 7. but I'm going to read Matthew 15 verse 8 first this people draws nigh unto me with their mouth and honors me with their lips but their heart is far from me people are capable of on the outside with their lips honoring God speaking about God preaching about God it's something that's done people draw nears with their with their mouth honor honors god with their lips but they don't really honor God with their life their inward thoughts their inward life it's just a show Matthew 7 21-23 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name have done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so these are people which are anointed with the spirit of God they have an anointing but they're not their heart is far from God why do I say that because they've refused to do the will of God they refuse to fought what's the will of God the word of God they have all outward signs of anointing and Supernatural power manifested and displayed in their life great Charisma is sent forth devils are cast out wonderful works are done healings are done but yet they are refusing to walk and live according to the word of God they want to follow their own way their own purpose who's the one that will enter the kingdom of heaven the one who has outward Prosperity outward manifestations no the one that does the will of My Father which is in heaven and I want to suggest to you that no one on earth is capable of doing the will of the Father in Heaven unless God calls you changes you and empowers you to do it we're all sold under sin there's no one that can do God's will on their own it's him giving you that new nature which agrees with him First Corinthians 10 verse 12. it is true Christians can backslide True Believers can backside black side True Believers can even have serious moral failures but one thing that we know they will stand correction they will repent they will make it right they won't try to hide it you know you see these false teachers on television and YouTube and they'll make little confessions about things but they just continue right on receiving a paycheck and quote unquote preaching they never repented they never really made things right they just did it because they were forced to do it there's no true repentance but each of us have to be in that position where uh if you think you stand don't be so proud of yourself don't get so lifted up and say hey I'm I'm standing I'm living as a Christian take heed watch out lest you fall this isn't saying Fall From Grace this is saying falling into sin but get falling into the Trap that the devil has take heed be humble Be watchful be mindful there's an enemy there's a devil that's trying to bring you into sin Luke 22 verse 31. I referred to this earlier and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan has desired to have you my just think about that transport yourself for a minute into the Heavenly places I think of job right away job Satan is having a conversation with with the Almighty I want I want I want Peter you know Peter was such a person that he was always the first to speak and he was so charismatic and just always in the front right that's danger that's danger zone that that's that's the place to be careful and what was it God had a purpose in letting saying go ahead Satan I'll humble this guy Satan didn't know he's playing right into God's hands God used that right there to bring Peter out of his big balloon head onto his knees in tears and crying before almighty God he knows how God knows how to do that Satan thought I want I want Peter because I want to use him as an antichrist God's oh you can try what did Christ say I have prayed for you that you Faith your faith will fail you not the mediator stood there said you can only go so far Satan you can't go any further than this is Faith is not going to fail him but this is going to be used to make a humble man Hebrews 12 14. follow peace with all man and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord again conditions what will be within True Believers following peace and holiness God will create God is going to work that in our life that's produced within us Holiness set apart to him and will follow peace we all won't be arguing and fussing with everybody making fights we will be peacemakers that's part of the character of Christ Galatians 6 8 for he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that sows to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting can be a born-again Christian genuine believer and yet what are you what are we sowing to because you'll reap what you sow if you sow after your flesh you're going to reap Hard Times difficulties trials and further and further problems until you repent make these things right with people and with God and then begin walking in the spirit and let's let's just be clear both of these things happen on a daily basis with us as believers in our marriage in our friendships sometimes we sin and we we walk after the Flesh and what does it produce problems then we then other times we're maybe two minutes later we're walking in the spirit and what is it doing it's bringing life it's bringing Joy it's bringing peace we're all doing that and you reap from both sides of that doesn't impact your salvation it doesn't change the fact that God has his hand on your life and he's working he's working through all those things in you even so faith if it have not works is dead being alone Faith produces works one John 1 verse 7 but if we walk in the light again conditional if 1 John 1 verse 7. next one should be no but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sins we've got to walk in the light we've got to take this light and live it we've got it we've got to feed on it and live in it first John 2 verse 4 he that saith I know him and keeps not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him First John 3 verse 14. we know that we have passed from Death unto life because we love the Brethren he that loves not his brother abides in death again all of these things are conditions we know we know that we pass from Death to life if we have love why because the new birth produces love in US for second Thessalonians 2 13. but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God has from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth so these These are the processes that God is taking us through sanctification and belief in the truth just continually being transformed by the word this is what must be produced by genuine salvation and we're going to skip ahead to Second our Philippians chapter 2 verse 12 and 13 musicians if you want to come wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your salvation own salvation with fear and trembling brother Tony come on up work it out work out your own salvation with fear and trembling carry to its ultimate conclusion carry your salvation to its ultimate conclusion why for it's God which works in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure I think right there you have those two things put together God is not going to push you through a pipe we need to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling and then we have the other part the clay it's God working in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure why do we work out our salvation because God is working in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure God is working therefore our response is fear and trembling and doing giving our all to walk with Christ making it the very heartbeat of our life foreign let's pray [Music] Heavenly Father we just come to you Lord and we're so thankful for your abundant grace we know Lord that
