[Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] we bless you thank you for tuning in on on the stream and going to continue on our sunday school topic of christian character part six and we'll continue looking at love and what we're gonna do is we're gonna finish from last time what we were talking about agape love and then we're gonna go into filio love so with that said we're going to start with first corinthians chapter 13 verse 4. i'll just read the first verse and then then we'll pray love is patient i'm reading from the english standard version of course the king james is a is the best version preferred version but sometimes it's a little uh wordy and difficult to understand and so in some instances i'll use the esv just to help us get a bigger picture of of what's being said love is patient and kind love does not envy or boast it is not arrogant amen let's pray heavenly father you're the god of all grace and you see us in this word and you see us and you see on one hand you see it as perfect as sinless not because of ourselves but because of the blood of jesus christ on the other hand you see that we need to grow and that i need to grow and there's there's ways that we still fall short of your perfect word lord but you're molding us and you're shaping us into the image of jesus christ and we ask that you would just continue to do that help us to be humble and help us to abound more and more in your love and in your grace we ask this in the name of jesus christ amen amen so like i said i was reading from the esv and we started out love is patient and kind love is patient you know that's sometimes that's our our biggest problem is we we do love and yet we get angry we get upset quickly and patience endures or love i should say endures all things it says in another place so it endures all sorts of hardships sufferings persecutions when people are purposely seeking to make you angry love is patient when the devil is attacking you from the left from the right it patiently endures that which god has god's providence has plotted out for your life love is kind that speaks of being tender and compassionate again this is agape love that's why in the king james version you see it's using the word charity it's trying to distinct distinguish itself from brotherly love so this love is kind it's compassionate it's tender it's kind even when others are rude it's kind when people don't deserve kindness you know if you look at the word um agape in the there's a kind of an expanded strong's concordance that goes into more detail about the different um greek words this it says agape is wider embracing especially the judgment and the deliberate ascent of the will as a matter of principle duty and propriety agape goes beyond feelings it goes beyond how we feel towards a person and says the word of god commands me to be kind to be patient to not be arrogant to not be rude and so i'm going to rise above my feelings at whatever moment this is and i'm going to do what is right in this circumstance let feelings follow that but it's an act of the will and it's looking at what is scripturally and morally in line with the character of god that's what agape love is looking at it's not looking at whether they deserve it you know when we didn't deserve it christ died for us when people oh all of us the bible says that the day you eat thereof that day you die sin sin is worthy of death so the the very moment that we sin we're worthy of death we live we even take our next breath that we breathe by god's grace and so we understand that he gives us good gifts even when we don't deserve it he supplies the needs of of people that hate and despise him god does it and he commands us to do the same thing love does not envy it it doesn't envy people when they're blessed with something materially or spiritually or the lord puts them in a different position maybe one that you think you deserve it doesn't go into a place of envy it rejoices with that person for the blessing that they receive it doesn't boast love understands love that's in our heart understands everything that we have is given from our heavenly father in whom is no variance it comes down from the father of lights to us as a blessing from him and when those blessings are removed and we face difficulty upon difficulty we understand that god has by his sovereign will plotted that out for us and says okay i can accept this i can i can deal with this it it it understands there's no reason to boast it's not arrogant love doesn't get in love of god in our heart doesn't get inflated with our own importance it stays humble it doesn't think less of we don't being humble isn't thinking less of ourselves it's thinking less about ourselves and more about others and so you know we we've whatever we've received it's been by the grace and purpose of god and as job said the lord gives and the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord and so it's in his sovereign hand to do with us as we will so if we start boasting god can take it right away from us so we just have to know that we're relying on him and everything it's not arrogant or verse 5 says rude in the esv so where it says doth not behave itself unseemly it's speaking of being rude so love is not rude my let's not point our fingers out at other people you know this is this is a good word i'm going to shovel that towards this one and i'm going to shovel that towards charles and i'm going to shovel that towards luther look inside look i'm looking inside of myself we all have a desperate need for god's mercy when we look at this verse and we all frankly fall short of loving in this way but by god's grace he's working with us and teaching us brother branham says in the bride there'll be perfect love we'll have here what they have over there when we get as we get closer and closer to the rapture so god's grace is sufficient in those things it's not rude in other words it it behaves with respect towards others it values others above itself the bible says in honor prefer one another it puts other people above say that person is more important than me not less important more important so so obviously you're not going to treat them with rudeness when you you view people that way seeketh not her own it says in the esv it does not insist on its own way wow love wants to ensure the salvation and the blessing of others paul says multiple times and in multiple different ways i was willing to give my own soul for you i was really to sacrifice my own self so that they could be saved now that is love that is love love is not uh easily provoked or love is not irritable it's not easily angered it's not looking for a fight in every circumstance it's not looking to establish itself it's looking for the establishment and the betterment of the other person love is not resentful or where it says thinks no evil that means that love does not assume the worst about a person it encounters we find that in some people we meet and sometimes in our own selves we see actions we see behaviors and we assume ab the absolute worst about them that's not what love does love hears something the person did oh they didn't mean it that way didn't brother branham say that that's absolutely scriptural thinks no evil it doesn't think evil about another person it says oh they didn't mean to do that that was just that was the devil trying to cause a stir i forgive him i lay it aside forget about it brother branham time and time again when the minister ministers that invited him or didn't invite him treated him so bad and people said people tried to even provoke brother branham against those people and he said no i i wouldn't want to do that to them because i wouldn't want anybody to do that to me and so that's love verse six it love it it does not rejoice at wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth love does not rejoice when something bad happens to another person or when a person sins or falls yep see i knew that they i knew that they were going to find i didn't have a good feeling about that person who's we've we've all thought it if we haven't if we haven't even said it out loud i knew that i knew that person was going to do no it's it grieves it should grieve our hearts if we have the love of god it should grieve us it should cause cause us to pray you know the bible says let everyone that stands take heed lest he fall so you see someone else fall it shouldn't be like i knew that was going to happen no it should be oh god by your grace don't let me don't let me fall let me stand on the truth i have nothing but you and lord my may my heart go out to that person in mercy and in love reaching out brother branham says you know there's that i believe the quote goes something like this he's talking to a young man and talking about a person that went astray and um let that rascal go the young man minister said to brother branham so brother abraham says oh my if my heart doesn't go out after that person then i'm the one that belongs here at the altar he said and i did and i went out after them and i brought them back by god's grace that's the heart of love but rejoices with the truth we don't rejuv we don't rejoice when a person sins it doesn't make us happy we rejoice when they l walk in the truth didn't john say that little chill little children i have i my my my joy is that you walk in the truth so that's our that's our joy if we have the love of god in our heart it's rejoicing when they walk in the truth if they walk in sin it grieves us it shouldn't anger us or drive us to hatred it should drive us to our knees to pray for them pray for them verse 7 love bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things the word bears there in the greek means to conceal or contain this reminds me of first peter 4 verse 8. he says above all keeping keep loving one another earnestly since love covers a multitude of sins so what does that mean to cover a multitude of sins aren't we supposed to expose sin aren't we supposed to preach against sin absolutely in general but when it comes to individuals we we're supposed to cover that what is what does that mean to cover it love doesn't gossip and expose all the wrongdoings of others love goes directly to the person involved and speaks directly to that person that isn't that what the bible says to do and i think it's matthew 17 jesus speaks about that he doesn't say if your brother sins go tell your pastor about it if your brother sins against you you go to your brother and be reconciled to him if he doesn't receive it take another person a witness another person that you trust bring them to them if they don't receive it tell it before the church and then cast them out it should solve it for the first time if you go to them with love with compassion with tenderness with a desire for reconciliation love bears all things love believes all things it's a strange thing to say believes all things what does that mean it doesn't believe lies because it doesn't rejoice in wrong doing it rejoices in the truth believes all things it believes the best about a person it doesn't believe the worst it it believe it believes for the best for every person involved that doesn't mean we experience the best from them but it still believes god can do the best in them and for that person and not not only that but it believes all the promises of god it stands with all the promises of god and it also hopes all things when the person has done the worst thing in their life when it looks to us they've sinned away their day of grace love says i still have hope in your restoration i still have hope in your transformation if god can save the apostle paul he can save anyone because the fact is he was literally trying to kill and destroy the move of god through the christians he was he and he did kill kill them and he did arrest them and he was on his way to do even more and to increase increase and more and more in in this in this thing and god met him when he had no desire for him paul wasn't seeking after god he was seeking after the god of his imagi sinful heart and imagination according to the law not the true and living god he wasn't looking for jesus but jesus came looking for that rank filthy blasphemous sinner so love hopes all things if we can if if the apostle paul was saved we can hold hope and belief and faith for people who are seemingly sinning away their day of grace love endures all things every trial every tribulation everything in this life every nasty thing a person says to you love endures it now that is god in you because we've all experienced resistance we've all spir experienced people frustrating us and hurting us we've all experienced being in churches where we feel like we were damaged we feel like we were hurt we feel like our faith was almost destroyed love endures all things and so if we have the love of god in our hearts we will go through those things and say i'll take this hit in order to serve god and serve other people you know if you start to serve god and i'm not saying talking about preaching i'm talking about love if you start to serve god in this way people are going to misunderstand people are going to get upset people are going to get frustrated with you think people are going to think evil of you and speak evil of you and guess what love endures all things don't don't it it will discourage you of course because you're human but don't let that prevail don't let that stop you from serving god he wants to use you so endure all things we when you love people you expose yourself to being hurt right you expose yourself to being hurt and the bible has all the answers for all of these things love endures all that love believes all the best about people love hopes for the best in people and for people love bears all things it it it goes through all things and it covers all things second corinthians 12 15 the apostle paul writes to the corinthians and i love this and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you that's a beautiful thing he says i'm going to i'm going to give my whole strength my whole ability all my possessions he's willing to do anything that he could for their spiritual growth and their blessing he's willing to do that and but notice what he says next though the more abundantly ii corinthians 12 15 though the more abundantly i love you the less i be loved aren't you if somebody's willing to give their whole self for your spiritual blessing and upliftment wouldn't you think that people would love that person more well it isn't always the case it isn't always what happens many times that's interpreted differently by people and paul says it doesn't matter what you do to me does not affect my love for you and though i love you more and more and more and you love me less and less i still am very glad to spend and be spent for you that's love galatians chapter 5 verse 13 through 15. for brethren you have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh look at this but by love serve one another so you've been called to liberty what are we gonna use your liberty for you've been called to be you're free from the law of sin and death by the the death of jesus christ through his blood you're free from the law of sin and death so now what should i use my freedom for by love serve one another the word serve there is the word doulos and it speaks of slavery offer yourself as a slave to other people by love serve one another that starts with your spouse next is your children and next is believers and after that is the whole world and so how critical this is what you've been set free to do this is what you've been delivered to do by love serve one another we we want to see christ manifested in the bride and we speak about that and we know that the scripture testifies that but what does that look like right here by love serve one another what is your occupation in life it's not i.t it's not working for the for the county it's not preaching my occupation in life is by love to serve one another that's the main goal that you and i should have young people do you want to have an aspiration in life do you want to have a goal that you shoot for what am i going to do when i grow up buy love serve one another have that in your heart plant that seed down in your soul that this is how i'm going to live by love serve one another i want to manifest jesus christ in this age because it says we're going to grow to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ what does that look like by love serve one another amen get yourself out of the way get your needs your desires out of the way and say how can i reach out how can i be a blessing open your eyes to what's going on around you god will use you but if you're if you just have your blinders on i see my life see what's going on in front of me i don't see anybody else there's no one here you know i make it really narrow i can't see luther i can't see charles i can't see brother here i can't see anybody but i love i love people take the blinders off see what's going on around you sometimes that's our biggest problem as christians is we're so focused and as young people we're so focused on ourself we're so focused on what can i do and you wanna be loving and you wanna do do right and you want to do good but you're narrow when your focus is so narrow on yourself and those people immediately around you and phones are not good for that either we have our eyes so much down in internet social media news of the world that it just puts us in shackles we weren't called to be in shackles we're called to be free and being free god sees everything right and if you're in touch and in fellowship with god god can speak to you about anything any need that's why we need gifts in the body of christ and gifts is not just merely standing on the platform and discerning something about sometimes god will let you know something private so you can pray about it or go to that person privately sometimes god will speak to you about doing such and such a thing for a person in a circumstance that they have in their life open your eyes get your vision of the uh up up to heaven and to those around you because there's lots of needs there's lots of people hurting there's lots of people that need a friend stop thinking about this this vision i have love i have love i have the love of christ yeah you do so use it you do i believe you do you're filled with the holy ghost so the holy ghost is in reaching out and that's something that we have to grow into verse 14 for all the law is fulfilled in one word even this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself so the law is fulfilled in that so we're under the new covenant we're still under the new covenant and that new covenant is not the ten commandments but it's the commandments written in our heart so if the law is to be written in our heart what's being written in our heart love if we're gonna reach the perfection of the new covenant okay what is the perfection of the new covenant today we're going to go on to perfection we're not going to lay the foundation what's the perfection of that brother branham it's perfect love perfect love so we need to have that perfect love towards our neighbor who's your neighbor everyone everywhere the whole planet so let's stand and and pray heavenly father we're thankful for your love for your mercy for your grace lord i pray that you would help us to increase more and more in this love may your agape love be in us lord reaching out and serving one another not because of something they they did or they deserved lord but because you called us to do it may the gifts of the spirit operate in our in our midst lord i'm not just speaking of supernatural gifts but those things which are just common sometimes ours becomes supernatural because there's they're infused with love give us all a vision of of of hearts and needs and help us to reach out to one another to by love serve one another lord we commit ourselves to you for your glory we ask that your spirit would be with us today that you would be in the midst of us as we worship and as the preaching of the word goes forth may you be glorified and lifted up we ask these things in jesus name amen amen god bless you
