TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] you [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] do [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music] um and then still uh talk about it so uh we'll we'll try to make that happen um i uh i wore my tweed today so we can maybe make the the biology happen um uh so um the the start of the the background information the on our little science class here is that way back in the day you know before darwin came along everyone believed there was a divine creator and you know everything was pretty copacetic and then darwin comes along and says well i found these different creatures um specifically the main one that people talk about is the birds that he found called finches and they all differ little varieties of finches they're all about the same but they have different beak shapes and because they have a different beak shape they need a different kind of different kind of food some eat seeds some little insects and he believed that over time they were all one bird and that over time they all sort of evolved into different kind of animal you know the same animal but have a different kind of niche that they're filling with their different attributes and that made pretty good sense to him and everybody else around him and so that's kind of how the theory of evolution came about and he said well if a little bird can evolve a slightly different beak shape that slowly evolves a slightly different diet there's really nothing that says that you can't run that to some absolute extreme and that little bird also turned into a bald eagle or something you know a lizard turned into a bird i mean there's you know that was his logic there and the scientific world kind of made perfect sense and to this day they more or less believe that however back in the late 1900s a group of scientists got together and they started questioning that and a lot of these scientists they weren't they don't necessarily even had a christian background they just said well our science on that we have on how any of this stuff comes to be isn't actually all that solid um because really you can take darwin's theory all the way back but once you get to a single cell you know you know the original cell that doesn't really work darwin didn't have a whole lot to say on that and there's really not a whole lot of information on how that single cell could come about because you really got to come from once you get to there the only thing smaller than that is you're coming from you know volcanic ash and you gotta if you're gonna say that life on earth originated from nothing you gotta explain how volcanic ash and stew turned into a single cell and that's that's the jump right there you that's the that's the that's real conundrum and um furthermore one of the issues that uh really that darwin couldn't have explained because he didn't the scientist wasn't advanced enough yet to know was really what was going on inside of a single cell because back then they thought they barely even knew cells existed by the 1950s they were still even kind of thinking a single cell really wasn't there wasn't much going on inside of it it was just sort of a little blob of goo and that was about it but after that they started developing things like um electron microscopes that could see sub you know cellular structures and things and they realize the inside of a cell is way more complex than anyone had any recollection right it just far just blew everyone's minds because you have a whole world living inside of every single cell in your body um full of intricate complex structures and once you hit that level then you run to this there's a quote of darwin where he says if you could ever find any structure that is so complex in biology it's so complex that you could not reduce it any farther to a sub component and it still function and you can prove that there's no way it could have just evolved that way then the whole theory comes apart and that was darwin said that and so once you get down to the cellular level you end up coming across loads of these very small yet very complex structures that you can't there's not really a way for them to evolve you remove a single piece of it the whole thing falls apart and so evolution doesn't really function anymore um and so this is kind of what started all these scientists really questioning this and they um they like i said they all come together they had a big conference because i mean a lot of these people you start questioning theory of evolution in a secular biology field you lose your phd real quick right i mean you lose your your professorship i mean so they were they all got together had a quiet little conference out on the beach in california and said uh are we all thinking the same thing here and um everyone's like yeah we are and so they built this uh those men eventually came together and they made that documentary that we showed at the senior youth last night in trying to put together something uh for this morning i actually managed to come across that same organization they have a youtube channel now it's great uh they have a lot more videos than just that documentary and i actually got one of their videos and i'll play it um today we'll go ahead and play video one got we got volume he spotlighted and made famous a number of really interesting discoveries that had been occurring in biochemistry and cell biology over the last two or three decades and what what biologists molecular biologists cell biologists microbiologists have been discovering is that at the level of individual cells there are little tiny examples of nanotechnology little tiny machines at work the flagellar motor is the one that he made most famous it's a rotary engine that powers a whip-like tail a protein tail that functions like a propeller and it moves the bacteria through liquid enabling the bacteria to essentially crack down the food supply and this little machine includes a rotor a stator a drive shaft a u-joint bushings bearings and a whip-like tail that functions like a propeller and the machine and some in some bacterial systems turns at 100 000 rpms in one direction and can reverse direction on a quarter of a turn and turn 100 000 rpm in the other direction bacterial flagellum is a true nanomachine about 40 nanometers in size it's amazing i mean e coli salmonella which are kind of our model systems for the bacterial flagellum can propel the cell about 20 lengths per second through a very viscous medium like water to these organisms and you extrapolate that to human scale 20 body lengths per second six foot person you know times 20 120 120 feet per second mark spitz or phelps would be setting records with this type of propulsion it's hardwired into a a signal tranduct a signal transduction circuit that allows the bacterium to sense changes in the sugar gradient in the uh in the surrounding liquid this signal transduction system is actually a short-term memory system where the cell is if it's going in the direction of an attractant a nutrient that it can use to metabolize it follows that chemical gradient if it's a repellent it will sense that and move in in the opposite direction so it's more than just this engine it's an extraordinary piece of nanotechnology it's high tech in low life and so just by spotlighting these extraordinary pieces of nanotechnology inside cells and the flagellar motor wasn't the only one one by any means beehee in a sense opened up a window for people he opened up the black box of the of the inner workings of the cell and said look this is much more complicate complex than anything that then than anything that the early evolutionary biologists had envisioned darwin knew nothing of this type of nanotechnology in cells and at the very least we've got to come up with an explanation for this okay so as one example um i would uh that was kind of one of the examples that they used in the documentary last night and you can see i mean they used the term drive shaft stator rotor they didn't come up with that because they're trying to in you know imply some sort of intelligent design the the scientists who discovered this these structures they look at that and said no that's what they are they're literally those components you if you saw it in a car that's what we would call it too um and they're incredibly complex and any single one of those components there's about 40 components that go to that structure you remove any single one of them the whole thing comes apart there's no way you can really build that structure or that that motor piecemeal doesn't it doesn't evolve it doesn't come about bit by bit you would have to have the entire thing pre-built loaded into the into the intelligence of that cell off the bat or the thing just doesn't get built if you there's no way that that gets produced gradually okay and um i mentioned for the senior youth who are here who are interested i mentioned another thing called atp synthase we'll play that second video and you'll get to see that because that wasn't in the documentary you want to play video 2 for me all life on earth depends on this tiny energetic molecule adenosine triphosphate or atp atp drives biochemical activity inside your living cells and is a key building block of dna and rna generating atp for your living cells are mitochondria electrochemical batteries that converts energy from the food you eat and oxygen from the air you breathe into atp so where does your atp come from deep inside your mitochondria rows of molecular motors generate atp the molecule essential to all life on earth enzymes bring together reactants to form a chemical bond converting mechanical energy into chemical energy a ring of enzymes work in step creating three molecules of atp with each cycle inside the molecular motor a rotating axle powers the sequence the axle is attached to a rotary molecular motor moved by the force of protons pushing from the other side of the membrane a difference in proton concentration propels the molecular mechanism [Music] synthesis of atp atp drives biochemical activity inside your living cells and is a key building block of dna and rna okay so these two structures again every single component of them is they're completely essential for the function of life without that structure that we just saw there life just doesn't exist the cell dies um there's nothing even exists on a bacterial level if you don't have that and you remove a single component from it you change one component of it everything's gone it's there's no life without that and it's incredibly complex those i mean it kind of looks a little funny because to our eyes because it's you know it's actually a 3d rendering of it you know with a computer but it's very accurate um that i know the guy who made that or i don't know him personally but i know of him the guy who made that animation um and he's a he's a biochemist and he uses really sophisticated machines to really figure out the structures of these these uh molecules that do this and he makes very accurate renderings of them so that we can see how how they function mechanically and you know um that that process that's going on there there's it's far too complex of a thing to just happen on accident right it's just not you're not gonna you know each one of those it kind of looks kind of like it's a bunch of like little globs stuck together well each one of those globs is a is a function of um amino acids uh sticking together and it makes that structure well it's incredibly complex and those amino acids are originally organized in a big chain and then those chains sort of congealed down into that blob and those blobs assembled into that big structure that you see well the the exact pattern in which those amino acids at the very ground level are assembled is incredibly important if one of those is off then the whole machine doesn't work it has to be 100 accurate and the pattern of that of how those amino acids are put together would might be very similar to the way that we might um maybe assemble an english sentence with letters you know you in the documentary they use a great example um imagine if you had you know two lines from a famous shakespeare play right to be or not to be that is the question right it's just not very many letters but what do you think are the odds if you started dumping scrabble pieces on a table they're randomly going to a sort into that sentence right it's not really it's not very likely right i mean i mean technically maybe but you're going to be dumping a lot of scrabble pieces for a really long time and even if you did the complexity of what we just saw isn't just two sentences it's several dozen volumes of shakespeare plays stacked into end you're going to be really you know dumping a lot of scrabble pieces then right it's just not going to happen no amount of of time and random chance is going to make that happen and so you wonder okay how does this happen how does the cell know how to how to assemble something like that well this is where we get into genetics um i want to i want to i'm going to use the one thing that i know if you're associated with a methodol we kind of have a bad taste in our mouth around the word dogma because brother branham uses it a lot um in a not a very uh we'll say it um like complimentary way um however i do want to just give a definition of dogma because i don't want you to get hung up on that word because it's a there's something really beautiful here if you if you can see it and if my phone will unlock oh come on um all right so the oxford uh or i'll go with the webster's definition of dogma first and it just simply means a doctrine or body of doctrines concerning faith or morals formally stated and other um and authoritatively proclaimed by a church the oxford definition of dogma would just simply mean a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true okay so this is just the absolute fundamental truth that any organization believes in we might say that they're you know we would have a dogma but our dogma would be the bible right we're not gonna accept anything outside of that um but in biology they also have a dogma and it is called the central it's the central dogma of biology the central dogma of biology states describes the flow of genetic information in cells from dna to messenger rna to protein it states that genes specify the sequence of mrna molecules which in turn specify the sequence of proteins now that sounds like a lot of word salad hopefully this last video i'll go with video five i'll skip over some of my videos five um the central dogma of biology this is it this is the this dogma input dna double helix contains two linear sequences of the letters a c g and t which carry coded instructions transcription of dna begins with a bundle of factors assembling at the start of a gene to read off the information that will be needed to make a protein the blue molecule is unzipping the double helix and copying one of the two strands the yellow chain sneaking out at the top is a close chemical cousin of dna called rna the building blocks to make the rna enter through an intake hold they are matched to the dna letter by letter to copy the gene at this point the rna needs to be edited before it can be translated into a protein this editing process is called splicing which involves removing the green non-coding regions called introns leaving only the yellow protein coding exons splicing begins with assembly of factors at the intron exon borders which act as beacons to guide small proteins to form a splicing machine called the spliceosome the animation is showing this happening in real time the spliceosome then brings the exons on either side of the intron very close together ready to be cut one end of the intron is cut and folded back on itself to join and form a loop the spliceosome then cuts the rna to release the loop and join the two exons together the edited rna and intron are released and the spliceosome disassembles this process is repeated for every intron in the rna numerous spliceosomes remove all introns so that the edited rna contains only exons which are the complete instructions for the protein again this is happening in real time when the rna copy is complete it sneaks out into the outer part of the cell then all the components of a molecular factory called the ribosome lock together around the rna it translates the genetic information in the rna into a string of amino acids that will become a protein special transfer molecules the green triangles bring each amino acid to the ribosome inside the ribosome the rna is pulled through like a tape there are different transfer molecules for each of the 20 amino acids shown as small red tips the code for each amino acid is read off the rna three letters at a time and match to three corresponding letters on the transfer molecules the amino acid is added to the growing protein chain and after a few seconds the protein starts to emerge from the ribosome ribosomes can make many proteins it just depends what genetic message you feed into the rna all right so i got four minutes left so we're going to try to wrap it up quick um so all of this really boils down to one thing and that is inside of every cell and i i could i could condense the entire um we say that we'll call this the central dogma of biology into one thing and that is inside of every single one of your cells is a coded message it is it is absolute um it includes the instructions to build your entire body through [Music] that process we just saw building proteins and pretty much your entire body's bait made out of these amalgamations of proteins okay and that genetic material that uh you know what is so often referred to in the message as that seed gene right you know we talk about genetics a gene um we have genes in our in within your dna that code for proteins that are the instructions on how to build proteins that is intelligent you can't really that doesn't arrive arise naturally there's no way to there's there's no known biological mechanism on how dna could arise naturally it is the instructions on how you're not just dumping scrabble pieces on a table it is the instructions on how to assemble those you know 23 different i think it's 23 different amino acids into something as complex as those structures we were seeing before right it's the blueprints it is it is the absolute proof that that some intelligence built that because it's so specific it's it can't really happen through random chance and if we saw this in any other format right you know bill gates called it called um dna the most complex computing system known to man this is bill gates right he writes computer programs and he doesn't imp you know rely on random chance to do it right it's built computer programs are built through intellect not through random chance and so if you have a a anything that is that is very clear written instructions on how to produce something that complex you're not going to call that random chance you're just not um it doesn't make any sense any more than we would see you know a statue carved out of rock and say well it's clearly wind erosion right it's just not gonna that doesn't make any sense obviously it's it's a person carved out of stone so some person must have carved it well this is a person written in in a in an intelligible code we might not understand all of it but it's very clearly build structures that turn into a person so we're not going to call that random chance either it's very clearly built by an intellect it's very clearly made by an intelligence and so that's that was about the extent of the documentary um and the where i would like to go from there is uh well i'll just i'll just say this um that that the genetic material that we saw right that process of dna and they mentioned that it's made up of four letters a c t and g right it's just repeating different lots of different patterns of those four letters repeated across these long long long long strands of dna those in a human body there was a 3.2 billion in a single set of human dna 3.2 billion of those little four letters in a line right and that's what makes up the whole body and your body can uncode those processes or those sequences and turn it into a person much like a computer can turn ones and zeros and turn it into a picture right very similar it's not too far off from the same idea um and um you know with 3.2 billion of those letters strung together you can't have one of them be wrong um can you pull up that picture the brother mark pulled the picture right at the end that i had there this is a sickle cell anemia so you see on the left normal red blood cell that's what everyone's got flowing through your veins and your arteries that's what they're supposed to look like on the right you have a sickle cell people with sickle cell anemia their red blood cells look like that and you can tell that's not a good thing right the shape of your red blood cell is what helps it move through your arteries without getting caught on things and getting stuck um it helps with the absorption of oxygen and for it to do its job well if it's shaped all like a crescent moon it gets hung up in your arteries creates blood clots um it's not going to absorb oxygen correctly it's going to cause a lot of problems now that major twist in the entire structure of a red blood cell comes from a single letter being off just one it's all it takes at a 3.2 billion right and this is you know when brother branham talks about you know the spoken word being the original seed and what's at the bottom of a seed is just a genetic package so this is with the heart of a seed is written instructions on how to manifest the life that that seed is designed to manifest it's the dna inside of it you get one letter off you get a disaster right you get you know we have the word of god this is our genetic this this is our genetic package that tells us how to manifest into into a a new into god's life right that spoken word was the original seed that will manifest into god's life well you get one letter off in that you will end up with something that is not god's life it'll it'll be a disaster right so um i'll uh i'll wrap it up there we're uh we're about one minute over so and uh brother matt already told me i could have a second one so we'll get a sequel all right we'll stand and have a word of prayer father we come before you this this morning and i want to thank you for this opportunity to maybe say something that would help the people maybe that they would see you in in nature more and even see them within your see within themselves father that maybe they would take these things and uh it would help them with your with their walk with you father and father um plea i would ask that you would take these words that i would say that any nerves or or any any spirit of myself that wouldn't wouldn't um extort or contort what you would have to tell the people they would hear it clearly through what you would have to say father ask he sings in jesus name amen and we'll have church in about 10 minutes [Music] do [Music] [Applause] do do [Music] you
