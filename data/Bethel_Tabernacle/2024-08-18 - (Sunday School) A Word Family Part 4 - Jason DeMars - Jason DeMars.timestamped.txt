[4:59] good good morning everyone God bless
[5:03] you we got the Powerpoint up perfect
[5:06] Let's uh let's stand as we read the word
[5:10] continuing in our subject a word family
[5:14] part four and we'll turn I'll go back to
[5:18] that Ephesians
[5:20] 6:4 and ye fathers provoke not your
[5:23] children to wrath but bring them up in
[5:25] the nurture and admonition of the Lord
[5:27] let's pray Heavenly Father we just
[5:30] Commit This Time To You Lord and we ask
[5:32] that your Holy Spirit would come and
[5:33] speak to us and and deal with us in a
[5:35] supernatural way Lord help us to lay the
[5:38] word in order here in our hearts and
[5:41] help help us to be open to wisdom and
[5:44] understanding and correction Lord we
[5:46] give ourselves to you in Jesus name amen
[5:49] God bless
[5:50] you I came across this
[5:54] on uh Instagram the other day and uh I
[5:57] had to save it CS Louis says children
[6:00] are not a distraction from more
[6:02] important work they are the most
[6:05] important work amen and that goes for
[6:09] anyone you could say what about what
[6:12] about the preacher what about the pastor
[6:14] again we said it before is you cannot be
[6:18] a qualifi I mean you can preach because
[6:20] a church will take any old person but a
[6:23] true ano true church with a true
[6:25] anointed man of God disqualifies himself
[6:29] when he does not is unable to lead his
[6:32] family
[6:33] properly so you can't put the you can't
[6:37] put the cart before the horse oh he's a
[6:38] minister I mean it doesn't matter what
[6:40] his family is actually it directly
[6:42] matters it directly impacts and if if
[6:47] the movement of the message would have
[6:48] been more serious about qualified
[6:50] ministers with their houses in order
[6:53] there wouldn't be so many false
[6:55] doctrines false teachings and
[6:57] destruction of lives that have taken
[6:59] place because of this mis false
[7:03] understanding a home not in order is a
[7:06] man who's not fit to lead the church
[7:08] period end of story so what is the man's
[7:12] most important work it's to lead his
[7:15] family it's to it's to nurture his
[7:18] family it's do it's to follow Christ and
[7:23] be the leader of the home you know we
[7:28] look at this scripture and and uh many
[7:30] commentators say oh he's implying that
[7:32] that uh mothers should do it too well he
[7:36] is but you you you that's not what he's
[7:40] actually saying he's telling the fathers
[7:42] are
[7:43] responsible so the father cannot shovel
[7:47] it off to
[7:48] Mom it's that's not the that's not the
[7:51] purpose the father must take authority
[7:55] in the home we spoke before about
[7:58] headship you know know yes men and women
[8:01] are equal in value in the sight of God
[8:04] but there is a hierarchy in the
[8:07] home absolutely is a hierarchy and me
[8:10] men are to be leaders it goes so far as
[8:14] commending Sarah for calling Abraham
[8:17] Lord see we we think that's funny in
[8:21] America and in the western world but it
[8:24] it it's the Scripture A man is in a
[8:27] position of authority
[8:29] and God so designs that he is to do good
[8:33] unto those that are under his authority
[8:36] he is to be a means of nurture and
[8:41] admonition to his family he's to be a
[8:44] means of
[8:45] provision and wisdom to his family if
[8:49] you look at this word nurture I said
[8:51] before his brothers say well I'm not a
[8:53] good teacher well too bad you signed up
[8:56] for the job even if you didn't know it
[8:59] because this word nurture is pidea
[9:03] theer's definition is the whole training
[9:06] and education of children which relates
[9:08] to the cultivation of mind and morals
[9:10] and employs for this purpose Now
[9:13] commands and admonitions now reproof and
[9:15] Punishment it's also the training and
[9:18] care of the body so it goes far beyond
[9:21] just like we we use the term nurture and
[9:24] it's more of a feminine attribute really
[9:27] but this word nurture is speaking of
[9:30] training and teaching so the job of a
[9:34] father is to train and teach not only
[9:37] his sons because it doesn't bring it
[9:39] doesn't bring a difference between Sons
[9:40] and Daughters Sons and Daughters he is
[9:44] responsible for both the teaching the
[9:48] education the upbringing but also the
[9:52] admonition admonition speaks of uh when
[9:56] bringing correction within teaching
[9:59] bringing correction upon them and so the
[10:02] Bible makes fathers responsible for this
[10:05] and as we spoke before it's not good for
[10:07] a man to be alone I will make him and
[10:10] help meet for him and so mother is to
[10:15] enter into this Vision to be helper of
[10:19] the father see that's why he says
[10:21] fathers is because it's Father's primary
[10:24] role he cannot Advocate that role to
[10:27] anyone else amen right
[10:29] but mother is the helper in this purpose
[10:34] and vision for the family amen and
[10:38] that's our most important job our number
[10:40] one most important job as fathers is to
[10:43] do this very
[10:45] thing it's it's providing financially
[10:48] absolutely but never at the expense of
[10:51] this if we say I'm the provider and it's
[10:55] it's at the expense of taking Authority
[10:58] in the home home there's a problem same
[11:00] thing with it doesn't matter if it's
[11:01] Ministry doesn't matter if it's a job it
[11:04] doesn't matter what it is you cannot
[11:08] surrender all of that job and that
[11:10] purpose so when you're done with work
[11:12] what's your
[11:13] job you don't lose responsibility it's
[11:16] not time to go home and drink beer and
[11:18] watch the
[11:20] sports it's time to go home and do this
[11:23] amen this is your job this is your
[11:25] purpose this is your life mission this
[11:27] is your vision it's the leg Legacy that
[11:29] you leave behind you as brother Matt
[11:31] preached about before you're going to
[11:33] leave a legacy it just could be garbage
[11:35] and trash Legacy or it can be the life
[11:39] and reality of Christ manifested in the
[11:42] form of a multiplied you and your wife
[11:46] that's God's purpose all
[11:49] right so um I think I'm going to come
[11:54] back to the sacred trusts we've reviewed
[11:56] them before now actually let's go let's
[11:59] go there uh we'll speak of them because
[12:02] it's uh it's connected now we talked
[12:05] about a woman is given these three
[12:08] sacred trusts but we also must remember
[12:11] that the father is the one responsible
[12:14] and we read that in the scripture as we
[12:16] as we cover this though the though
[12:19] though his daughter is given the sacred
[12:21] trust the father is the is the one that
[12:24] is supposed to be the guardian of that
[12:27] sacred trust the edge indicator of that
[12:30] sacred trust in all the details so we
[12:33] ultimately find that in the Bible God
[12:36] lays it at the feet of dad to ensure
[12:40] this is what is passed on doesn't lay it
[12:43] at the feet of mother she's there at the
[12:46] side of her husband but it's her husband
[12:49] to take responsibility so from invisible
[12:52] Union notice now we find her body as the
[12:54] bedding grounds and therefore it's a
[12:56] sacred trust not to defile that
[13:00] that's the first one the second one she
[13:01] has a sacred Trust of virtue committed
[13:03] to her by her Lord a certain virtue
[13:06] nothing else holds it but a woman right
[13:08] that's committed to her by God she must
[13:10] not defile that
[13:11] virtue and the third one now we find out
[13:14] she has been given this sacred trust
[13:15] that she must not break of Womanhood act
[13:18] have her character raise her children be
[13:21] honorable to her husband so three sacred
[13:25] trusts young ladies you should memorize
[13:28] this all all sisters should know this
[13:30] that are following the message of the
[13:32] hour it's your body one your virtue two
[13:37] and your Womanhood three so your body
[13:41] keep your body pure your virtue that's
[13:44] your ability to say yes or no it's your
[13:47] your strength and Womanhood it's the
[13:49] character and conduct before your UH
[13:52] children and husband or your father
[13:54] could
[13:55] say all right and so let's look in the
[13:58] scripture
[13:59] Deuteronomy
[14:01] 22 these are some very plain scriptures
[14:04] but it's the word of God and it's an
[14:05] important point that we need to
[14:10] understand if any man take a wife and go
[14:13] in unto
[14:14] her and hate her and give occasions of
[14:17] speech against her and bring up an evil
[14:19] name upon her and say I took this woman
[14:22] and when I came to her I found her not a
[14:25] maid then shall the father of the damsel
[14:28] and and her mother take and bring forth
[14:31] the tokens of the damsels virginity unto
[14:33] the Elders of the city in the
[14:37] gate and the damsels father shall say
[14:40] unto the elders I gave my daughter unto
[14:42] this man to wife and he hates her and lo
[14:45] he's given occasions of speech against
[14:47] her saying I found not thy daughter a
[14:49] maid and yet these are the tokens of my
[14:51] daughter's virginity and they shall
[14:53] spread the cloth before the Elders of
[14:55] the city and the Elders of that City
[14:58] shall take the man and chastise him do
[15:01] you know what this
[15:02] means they'll take that man seize him
[15:05] and say you're you're lying you're
[15:07] bringing a bad name upon a virgin of
[15:10] Israel and it's not just oh you're a bad
[15:13] guy they will beat him this is what this
[15:16] word is saying he's to be beaten with a
[15:18] rod for bringing a bad name upon a
[15:21] virgin of Israel so this is God's
[15:24] Viewpoint of the character of a woman if
[15:28] if if a man is going to speak against
[15:31] the character of a woman it's
[15:33] responsible for the father and the
[15:35] elders to
[15:37] uphold Purity and speaking correctly
[15:41] about women am right and so the man will
[15:44] first thing we go to the elders we're
[15:46] going to deal with this publicly you're
[15:47] trying to shame my daughter now they
[15:50] shame him not only beat him but he
[15:53] should pay some pay a fine and they
[15:54] shall immerse him in a 100 shekels of
[15:57] silver and give them ah unto the father
[16:01] of the damsel because he brought up an
[16:03] evil name upon a virgin of Israel and
[16:05] she shall be his wife he may not put her
[16:07] away all his days by saying this God has
[16:12] has so clearly made it clear is be sure
[16:15] about what you're doing be sure about
[16:17] her you're following the leading of the
[16:19] Lord about who you're marrying and be
[16:21] sure that as a father you deliver your
[16:26] daughter as a virgin to the man that she
[16:29] is going to be married to right so this
[16:32] is this is putting it so critical
[16:34] because the next part is if she's not if
[16:37] she's not it's
[16:39] horrible it's a horrible result and it's
[16:42] a horrible thing so here the man is
[16:44] shamed publicly shamed and told to fine
[16:48] but if this thing be true and the tokens
[16:49] of virginity be not found for the damsel
[16:52] then they shall bring out the damsel to
[16:54] the door of her father's house and the
[16:55] many men of her City shall Stone her
[16:58] with stones that she die because she's
[17:00] wrought Folly in Israel to play the
[17:02] in her father's house so shalt
[17:04] thou put evil away among you so we see
[17:09] again it was fraud they they've
[17:13] committed virginal fraud you've said
[17:16] okay I'm delivering this the father is
[17:18] delivering his daughter to a man and
[17:21] lying about it and finds oh she's not a
[17:25] virgin the the penalty is death you say
[17:28] my goodness it's it's a harsh thing yes
[17:31] it is because it's that serious it's a
[17:34] life and death matter God wants to God
[17:38] demands to see the purity of our
[17:43] daughters right and so you know again
[17:47] we've talked about this being a father
[17:50] the headship of a man can be also can be
[17:55] not used and he becomes a or it
[17:59] can turn into something where it's a
[18:02] damaging thing right God is not in
[18:06] either of those sides of things he's not
[18:09] he he condemns an effeminate man that
[18:12] surrenders the leadership of his home to
[18:14] his wife and the leadership of his
[18:16] children to his wife but he
[18:18] also condemns the overbearing man that
[18:21] would say oh my daughter has to be a
[18:23] virgin let's lock her up in the
[18:26] shed let's let's beat her up so that she
[18:28] knows that's a
[18:31] perversion people take demented people
[18:34] take the take the word and pervert it
[18:36] both directions right the bride of
[18:39] Christ is not going to do this amen a
[18:42] man is told to instruct his children and
[18:45] correct them right he's not told to beat
[18:49] them and abuse them he is told to spare
[18:53] the rod and you hate the child right
[18:57] that's in a season of life but teaching
[18:59] is primary beating is the last
[19:04] resort even if it's the scriptural form
[19:07] of corporal punishment in a in a home
[19:11] the first Resort is not yelling and
[19:15] uncontrollable Behavior that's anger and
[19:17] and it's condemned by the scripture a
[19:19] fruit of the spirit is self-control so
[19:21] when we're correcting our children it
[19:23] demands kindness fruit of the spirit
[19:26] self-control fruit of the spirit so when
[19:29] you're angry and flying off the handle
[19:31] that's not showing the fruit of the
[19:32] spirit that's just teaching your
[19:34] children that it's okay to be out of
[19:38] control and to be angry no it's teaching
[19:42] and instruction is the first
[19:44] order of
[19:46] fatherhood
[19:47] amen and so we can understand then the
[19:51] the value and the importance that God
[19:53] places on Purity and so as a father this
[19:57] should be age appropriately the vision
[20:01] that you're putting forth in your family
[20:02] with the help of your wife for the more
[20:05] sensitive issues that go along with this
[20:09] but the reality is it shouldn't be
[20:10] something that's off topic for a father
[20:12] to speak to his daughters about for it's
[20:15] his duty to ensure that she is pure so
[20:18] she has to even know what that
[20:21] means all
[20:24] right Exodus
[20:27] 22:16 and if a man man entice a maid
[20:29] that is not betrothed and lie with her
[20:32] he shall surely endow her to be his wife
[20:37] and if her father utter utterly refus to
[20:40] give her unto him he shall pay money
[20:42] according to the dowy of virgins again
[20:46] it is the Father's authority over his
[20:50] daughter we spoke before we let's let's
[20:53] take a short Side Track into courtship
[20:57] our modern
[20:59] idea of Disney courtship is not anything
[21:02] to do with the Bible following our heart
[21:06] and falling in love and all of these
[21:08] things uh these are not in the
[21:11] scripture now the scripture does not say
[21:14] you must have an arranged marriage or
[21:16] you must not have an arranged marriage
[21:18] but the scripture very clearly puts the
[21:20] authority of daughters into the hands of
[21:22] their father and so therefore as as a
[21:26] guardian of purity the father should not
[21:30] allow any young man to speak to his
[21:33] daughter unless it is first prayerfully
[21:37] decided by the
[21:39] father with along with his daughter see
[21:44] of course he needs to understand where
[21:46] her heart is at in all of this but it's
[21:50] supposed to come through him our modern
[21:52] way of doing this even how it's creeped
[21:54] into the message where we've used social
[21:57] media to bypass the word of God it's
[22:00] wrong it's wrong it's sinful it's
[22:02] against the word of God it's against the
[22:04] authority of the father and these things
[22:07] need to be taught and established by
[22:10] preachers and also fathers in the
[22:12] home there is no such thing as a
[22:15] daughter having a love life apart from
[22:18] her
[22:20] father until she's married because what
[22:23] are daughters daughters don't
[22:27] marry daughters are given in marriage
[22:31] Sons take the risk take the authority go
[22:35] out and find someone's daughter to get
[22:39] married to daughters wait upon the Lord
[22:43] pray make themselves ready right and
[22:47] then under their father's
[22:50] Authority that is when courtship and
[22:54] engagement takes place but it's through
[22:57] the authority of the father and any kind
[22:59] of modern Innovation to that we need to
[23:02] get away from that because it's not
[23:04] scriptural because it's exactly what the
[23:07] word said they're given in
[23:09] marriage and even even to the point as
[23:12] we read before headship headship in
[23:15] modern Christianity of the man is little
[23:18] more than just a word but in the
[23:21] scripture we find that headship means
[23:25] decision making as we read before I
[23:28] believe it was in uh numbers 30 you can
[23:31] read it yourself that any decision a
[23:35] man's wife or daughter would make he can
[23:39] invalidate according to the scripture he
[23:41] can say nope you're not doing that and
[23:44] she if she wants to be an obedient wife
[23:46] she says
[23:48] okay she might she might not agree and
[23:50] she might be able to voice her opinion
[23:53] why she doesn't agree but ultimately by
[23:55] the word it requires a wife to be
[23:57] obedient
[23:59] it requires a daughter to be obedient to
[24:02] what her father says I know it's not
[24:04] popular I know it's not what the
[24:06] denominational world says but we're not
[24:09] going by the denominational World we're
[24:11] not going by
[24:12] feminism this is an attack against God's
[24:15] word we have to go back to the word and
[24:18] follow
[24:20] that right you love me still even if you
[24:24] don't I don't care
[24:29] right brother Luther we're going to go
[24:31] by the word and we're going to go by
[24:32] what's
[24:34] right as for me in my house we will
[24:36] serve the Lord think of a man took the
[24:38] authority to say that he didn't say dear
[24:40] wife could could our house serve the
[24:42] Lord would it be okay with
[24:45] you he said we will serve the Lord and
[24:48] he takes the authority that's necessary
[24:51] to do it and a good obedient wife says I
[24:54] will submit to my husband and I'll
[24:56] reverence my husband
[24:59] amen all
[25:01] right 1 Timothy
[25:04] 2:9 instructions to Women In Worship and
[25:09] in the home in like manner also that
[25:12] women Adorn themselves in modest apparel
[25:16] with shamefacedness and sobriety not
[25:18] with broided hair or gold or pearls or
[25:21] costly array you wouldn't know it by
[25:24] modern Christianity but the Bible
[25:26] commands a woman to dress modestly
[25:29] that means she can't parade herself
[25:31] around in a
[25:34] bikini that means she can't parade
[25:37] herself around in yoga
[25:39] pants in public it's a public perversion
[25:43] if people were right in their mind those
[25:46] women would be covered up and arrested
[25:48] and taken away and put away because
[25:50] they're
[25:53] insane it's an absolute affront to
[25:58] common decency the way women dress today
[26:01] so the Bible says modest apparel the
[26:03] word apparel is the word
[26:05] catasto it's a compound word Kata means
[26:10] letting down and stole was the common
[26:12] Garment of the day for the Greeks in the
[26:15] Greek language so what does it mean
[26:18] catasto means a long dress is is the
[26:22] correct way of looking at this this word
[26:26] so it's a long dress that's character
[26:28] ized by modesty
[26:30] so a long dress that fits your body does
[26:33] not qualify as being modest clothing in
[26:38] the beginning was was to be that which
[26:41] covers the body not that which reveals
[26:44] the body the first clothing designers
[26:47] Adam and Eve made for themselves a
[26:50] bikini just to cover their private parts
[26:53] and God said when the presence of God
[26:56] came they ran and what did they say hey
[26:58] we hit ourselves cuz we were naked so
[27:01] even with their bikini on they realized
[27:03] they were in a state of undress they
[27:05] were in a state of nakedness so what did
[27:08] God do he clothed them with coats of
[27:11] skins coats of skins coat is the Hebrew
[27:14] word coutet and it what did what did it
[27:17] do it always covered from the neck down
[27:20] to below the knees and for dress
[27:22] occasions it always went to the ground
[27:24] for work occasions it went went just
[27:26] below the knees and this is revealing to
[27:29] us that clothes are designed for to
[27:33] cover nakedness amen not revealing
[27:38] nakedness all right then he says also
[27:41] that they adorned themselves in modest
[27:43] apparel modest long dress with
[27:47] shamefacedness and
[27:49] sobriety so shamefacedness speaks of
[27:52] being shy so a a woman's character
[27:55] outward character should be a expressed
[27:58] as in in a way of being sober and shy so
[28:03] that that's the outward expression the
[28:05] outward expression of the inward
[28:07] condition of the heart so shyness and
[28:10] modesty are on the inside should be
[28:14] expressed in the outward then he says
[28:17] not with broided hair or gold or pearls
[28:20] or costly array now he's not saying you
[28:23] can't braid your hair if you look at
[28:25] what brother brandham says he speaks of
[28:27] this as there was a style of hair in
[28:30] fact if you look at the details they
[28:32] took strands of gold and pearls and they
[28:35] braided it into their hair to show their
[28:39] wealth and it was a very immodest and
[28:42] ungodly thing to do and Paul is speaking
[28:45] to that specifically not that hair can't
[28:47] be braided no but that with that the
[28:51] that in there it was it was speaking of
[28:54] something that was very
[28:56] immodest all right
[28:59] but which becometh women professing
[29:02] godliness with good works the way she
[29:05] dresses and the way she acts it should
[29:09] speak outwardly of a woman that
[29:12] professes godliness with good works amen
[29:16] so I want to hold that thought there
[29:18] good works because we're going to come
[29:19] back to that as we get to the last um
[29:22] towards the end of uh 1 Timothy
[29:26] 2 let the woman and learn in Silence
[29:29] with all
[29:32] subjection needs no
[29:34] interpretation this is what the word
[29:36] says you're welcome to say amen
[29:38] hallelujah shout and dance and run up
[29:40] and down the aisles that's that's
[29:42] wonderful you're welcome to when it's
[29:45] the the time is in order speak in
[29:47] tongues interpret tongues and prophesy
[29:49] and so forth but you're not in a
[29:52] position to be a teacher right that's
[29:55] what the scripture says but I suffer not
[29:57] a woman to teach
[29:59] nor to usurp authority over the man but
[30:03] to be in
[30:05] silence this is not only speaking of the
[30:08] home it's also speaking of the church
[30:11] and it's also speaking of in society in
[30:14] general a woman is not to be put in a
[30:17] position of
[30:19] authority no matter where it
[30:24] is over the
[30:26] man but to be in silence in another
[30:28] place it says if a woman has questions
[30:31] let him ask at home um at one point in
[30:34] time you know the the the early church
[30:38] when a teacher would get up and preach
[30:41] people would actively ask questions or
[30:43] even say oh but what about this
[30:45] scripture so this was a process that
[30:47] would happen and what what Paul in 1
[30:50] Timothy 2 and also in 1 Corinthians 14
[30:53] is saying when the teaching is going on
[30:56] a woman should be quiet
[30:58] and if she has any questions it's she
[31:00] should ask her husband at home that's
[31:02] the scripture that's offensive to this
[31:05] modern world but it's exactly what the
[31:08] word says we don't go by feminism we go
[31:11] by the word
[31:13] amen why Paul why should we do this oh
[31:16] because culture says
[31:18] so culture demands it no creation order
[31:22] Adam was first formed then Eve and Adam
[31:27] was not deceived but the woman being
[31:30] deceived was in the transgression so
[31:32] Paul takes what was applicable to Adam
[31:34] and Eve and he applies it to EV all men
[31:37] and all women so how does he do that why
[31:40] should woman not preach well he's
[31:42] telling you right now women are more
[31:45] easily deceived than men
[31:47] oh how do you dare you say that women
[31:50] and men are exactly the same they're not
[31:53] God didn't create them the same he
[31:55] created men and women differently with
[31:57] different roles and why is the the it's
[32:01] the spirit of the age is what it is why
[32:03] would we be offended by that it is the
[32:06] absolute it's probably the one of the
[32:09] most clearest and easy to understand
[32:11] doctrines that the Bible puts forward is
[32:15] the position of a man and the position
[32:16] of a woman it's not complicated it's not
[32:19] difficult to understand it is difficult
[32:22] for people to swallow why because
[32:25] they've been under 140 years of f
[32:28] feminism that's why it's difficult to
[32:30] swallow and because all media and all
[32:33] all entertainment and all uh news
[32:37] agencies and every book that you read
[32:40] and every article that you read
[32:42] practically is preaching
[32:44] feminism and it's all a lie from the pit
[32:47] of Hell and it's Satan trying to
[32:51] infiltrate the message of the hour to
[32:54] make young ladies discontent with the
[32:57] place that God has put them in in fact
[32:59] it's the most glorious
[33:01] position for a woman
[33:05] amen notwithstanding she shall be saved
[33:09] in childbearing if they continue in
[33:11] faith and charity and Holiness with
[33:13] sobriety now strange scripture everyone
[33:16] reads that and goes what is it talking
[33:18] about so it's not talking about well
[33:22] when she's bearing when she's giving
[33:24] birth she'll be safe because we're still
[33:26] under the curse and there's women that
[33:28] die there's Christian Godly Christian
[33:30] women that die in childbirth it's not
[33:33] speaking about that if you look at the
[33:35] word in it's actually really speaking
[33:38] about the word through so we're not
[33:41] women are not saved from childbearing
[33:45] they're not saved by bearing children
[33:48] they're saved by grace through
[33:51] faith it's by the blood of Christ Alone
[33:55] through faith alone however remember
[33:57] says if they
[33:59] continue how did it how did we read
[34:04] that not not with braided hair gold or
[34:07] cost way but but which becometh women
[34:10] professing godliness with good works so
[34:14] works is Faith
[34:17] Express okay so when when you're
[34:20] speaking about good works there's good
[34:23] works that a woman is ordained to
[34:26] fulfill in her life life and they would
[34:28] be distinct and different than the good
[34:31] works a man would now many of them
[34:33] overlap but there are some specific ones
[34:35] that don't overlap and so when we look
[34:38] at this is you're talking about um show
[34:42] me show me your faith see we're talking
[34:46] about outward expression so there's
[34:49] always has to be good works that
[34:51] accompanies genuine Born Again Faith so
[34:54] when you're filled with the Holy Ghost
[34:57] it's is going to produce Works in you so
[34:59] what are the works that are produced in
[35:01] a woman they're different than a man
[35:04] it's through keeping of the home it's
[35:06] through childbearing right so these are
[35:10] the works that God has designed for a
[35:12] woman to do and they're to be done what
[35:15] in faith and agape love and Holiness
[35:19] with sobriety so these are the works
[35:22] that God has ordained a woman to do and
[35:25] it's not a shameful thing it's not a bad
[35:28] thing it's a glorious thing I I could
[35:29] say for myself as a
[35:32] man there's two people in the world that
[35:36] are more precious to me than anyone and
[35:41] it's first my wife she
