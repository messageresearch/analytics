TRANSCRIPT
========================================
those again do we believe that this morning even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven notice the distinction this is in a priest a prophet a king this is the lord himself brother branham said christ does all of it the shout the voice the trump all of it he does when he descends notice let's read it again for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be called up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words you can be seated this morning we know that from the as we spoke last time on this that that verse 17 and you can just pull that back up brother kevin says then we we which are alive and remain shall be called up now we know that that the the word that we use there uh the english word that we use rapture you won't find it here in first thessalonians 4 you won't find it in first corinthians 15. it actually comes from the latin version of the bible and the word is if i was just to pronounce it would be rapturo or something like that it sounds very similar to the word rapture that's where we get the word rapture so people who say that rapture is not in the bible well that's not necessarily true it actually is in the bible just not that english word rapture but the latin rap rapture is in there but the greek the hebrew word the in the greek word that is used here actually is harpazo which means when it says we shall be called up that word means to be snatched that's what if you click on the word and that's exactly what it says to be snatched and we know what that means to snatch something out of someone's hand to snatch something away and this is what the the the bible is trying to convey here that we which are alive and remain shall be snatched we shall be called up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord now what you'll find here distinctively in the bible when you study it is that you're going to see that there are certain scriptures that pertain to to the bible says christ coming in in his glory we know that there's a lot of things that you're going to read about that pertain to separate uh time it's the same timeline but separate events along that timeline because the bible speaks very clearly about the great tribulation and it speaks about um in the great as we're teaching here this morning it speaks of a great tribulation period and the bible says that there's never was a day like it and there's never going to be another day like it it's going to be the day of the lord and we don't uh we don't we we wouldn't uh we would never try to convey that that we know everything uh in a in a uh in a chronological sense uh because even myself i remember maybe two or three months ago actually back in february this year i had something upon my heart that i created a document and and i started putting a document i still have it putting it together called what happens next and i was i was my attempt my ambition i should say was to uh to chronologically lay out what happens next in time we know certain things that are coming we're waiting for the rapture waiting for the body change there's the millennium there's the great white throne judgment there's the resurrection so all of those things i was trying i was going to lay out in order and i and i sort of tied myself in in knots trying to do it and what i realized the lord stopped me i had so many things together and then questions about this and the lord holy spirit to stop me and and just re just told me um you're not going to be able to do this because i've i don't want you to be able to list every little thing and every spot and every every little uh line that you could mark for the timeline because some of it is a mystery and brother branham says how does god interpret his word how does god interpret his word come on you message students here brother branham said how does thank you he brings it to pass god interprets his own word by bringing it to pass and so we would be uh we would be out of the line in order of god's word to try to put and that doesn't mean we don't know something but to try to put a chronological event for every single thing i don't think god really intended it to be that way there are certain portions as we've said many times that apply specifically to you there are certain things that that apply generically to the entire mystical body of christ and there are certain things that don't apply to us in any way shape or form i i put together a document brother kevin you can go ahead and bring that up because we're just going to look at it here just for a moment and i want to read to you i didn't get a chance to do this wednesday i got to some of them and ran out of time so this is going to be a lot of reading but i want you to i want you just to pay attention i've got it on the screen the first document i sent you brother kevin and you could make that just as big uh maybe if you could make it bigger it'd be probably better can you see that brother jason to mars in the back can you see that okay maybe a little bit a little bit bigger if you could brother kevin maybe command plus i think yeah if you can you may even have to scroll left and right but that's fine i want you to listen close because this i believe is very important because it sets our expectation on the right things because if we're not careful paul's that just for a moment because everyone's reading the head if we're not careful when we have the we we when you have the false when you have a false expectation or maybe not even a false expectation but a lot of times there's great amount of fear in what you don't know right so what you don't know there's a lot of well i've heard this and what about this over here and then there's this brother branham said this over here about the squeeze and then he talks about over in this place about how that persecution will come and run us together then i heard this brother a lot of times what you'll realize when if you were to if you were to be able to narrow down you say well didn't brother branham say this if you were able to trace that back and trace it all the way back to where that thought got put in your mind it was most of the time it's never actually you reading something that the prophet said or something that you heard brother branham say but usually it's it's laced in with this brother said this and this preacher over here said this and this teacher said this and then you sort of piece it all together and you know what you have you still don't really know you just didn't didn't this say this and aren't this and what that what that will bring is an unnecessary fear so we don't want unnecessary fear when we can know right we're teaching here and i titled this this morning the purge listen what brother adam says in the seventh seal brother kevin if you want to bring that up he says the first thing the first thing was that the sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation period for purification for purification she had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message now this is not the heathen this is not the unjust this is not the the sinner brother branham says this is that notice the beginning this is that sleeping virgin the foolish virgin and he said they were to be purged this was the point of the tribulation period there's a purpose for the millennium and it has to do with you and me and there's a purpose for the tribulation and it has to do with the foolish virgin it doesn't have to do with me or you there's something god is going to accomplish in the millennium and that's rest that's restoration for you and for me but then there's something he's wanted to accomplish in the tribulation period she had to be purged for her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message this she was done in the tribulation period so what what again just to make it crystal clear the purpose of the tribulation period was for purification and for purging for sins of unbelief and rejecting the message we're at the end you can just follow with me we're at the end and we see that we're and we see we're at the end there's no there's not no way to build upon the corruption how can we build a city upon the charred ruins of a sodom and gomorrah how can we do it there's only one phoenix left and that's the coming of the lord jesus now that's a group follow me that's a group the coming of the lord jesus encompasses many different things one of them is the rapture one of them is the catching away that's why i said you'll find in your bible there's certain scriptures where it talks about christ coming with the saints and then he comes in all of his glory and then every eye shall see him but then the bible also talks it would be it would be contradicting itself if the come if the second coming of the lord the tribulation period and the rapture were all just the same exact thing then it would be contradictory because you'll also find scriptures where the bible says that he comes like a thief in the night he comes like a thief in the night well how do you reconcile that with him coming in his glory in every eye and every tongue shall confess not the same exact happening not the same exact time he comes like a thief in the night now remember he's not a thief he's not coming as a thief that you got to be careful how you apply this because you don't you don't steal something that already belongs to you and i already belong to him so you already been purchased by him so he's not coming as a thief to steal something because he's all he's doing is claiming what's already his but to the world it will be like a thief because what does a thief do you look around something that was there's gone suddenly it's vanished so the bible says he comes like to the world like a thief in the night listen he says we're at the end and that's the coming lord jesus my he says a purification let me find my place a purification through the tribulation period to bring back a restoring of a world for a people who are just in the sight of god and live by his word what is the purpose of the tribulation period purging and what is also being purged is the earth that's why the brother madam says what does he do he he he it's just water blood and spirit he's already we already know that noah's uh ark we already know that the flood of noah's day he already washed it baptized it with water right his blood spilled upon the earth when he was crucified now what's left a fiery baptism and that's why the bible says the element shall melt with fervent heat means the very in the tribulation what's he doing it will be purged the atmosphere the earth i'm talking very naturally here very very naturally it will be an a maybe an atomic bomb maybe some kind of uh nuke you know brother branham says that the last thing that he's seen was american smoldering ruins and he says that was the last thing just it was smoldering so we know that what is you say well that's god just pouring out his wrath well no no no no he's purifying he's purging the earth for you so that you can live in an earth that matches what's inside of your soul because what's inside of your soul not your flesh is purity righteousness and so the earth will match the condition of the people that live in it that's in essence what he's saying here that are just he says that's coming uh a purification of the tribulation to bring back a restorative word for people who are just in the sight of god to live by his word we've got to go quick now and then at that time see the gentile bride then at that time the gentile bride is in heaven and the sleeping virgin the gentile virgin is not to be saved during that time of tribulation she's already been saved but has been rejected in the bride and she only goes through the tribulation period for the time of purification because she has rejected christ not jesus of nazareth but she's rejected christ the word for her purification can you say amen then she has to suffer for her deeds but the bride who has become the word a complete atonement was made of christ because he is the word that body was rendered and when the body was rendered the bride was in the in that body because it's all the word amen you see it i do i see it the conflict between god and satan brother branham says there's no place where the church ever goes through the tribulation period is referring to the elected christ's blood and the fullness of the application of the blood of jesus christ cleanses all sin and why do we have to be purged we are purged daily no tribulation so we have a choice we'll either go through a tribulation to be purged or we can be purged right now i say lord purge me now listen listen what jesus said in saint john 5 24. now let's just move past that brother branham says here notice in this next quote if standing in line to get into church is going to only be a memory what is going to happen this is a question here what is going to happen if we are not going through the tribulation are we to be seen same some suffering if we're not to see see this question is probably this i'm trying to hurry i ought to do this uh to lay these back because there's a place you could stay on it and then i stay on in an hour just tear it down i'll stop look the people are wanting to say that thinking the church is going to hit the tribulation see it won't it can't because it's already redeemed the church the nominal believers like lot he's going through the tribulation period and be saved as if it was by fire noah went through the tribulation period carried above it come out with ham with who polluted the earth again see lot came his own daughters slept with him and had children by his own daughters see but abraham brought forth the royal seed brought forth the seed of the promise enoch went to glory in the rapture and he's laying these types in here to show you there's a type for a ch for a par for foolish virgin to go through tribulation and bride to be raptured and he says enoch went to glory in the rapture just just took a walk and went home he never went through the tribulation period you see there you are see it does not the bible cannot be the types can can't fail see it does not predict that the bride now the church will go through the tribulation period now the people say what about the early saints that was the changing of the dispensations that was under persecution which if you were here to hear this church ages let's move down to the underlying portion here right just back up right before it he says then come to the time of the calling out of the bride which was to escape all damnation all damnation in the book of luke jesus says that and says he says pray always and he says so that you may be accounted worthy to stand before the son of man and to escape all these things i love that he used that word escape because we're going to escape that means that great trouble is going to be brewing there's going to be great trouble in the land it's not going to be a time of peace it's a great time of trouble but we'll escape we'll be snatched up we'll be called away in the time of trouble psalms 27. he says he says now that uh let me find encounter worthy escape all the damnation and wrath to come upon the earth that you might be kind of worthy to escape it not go through it escape it do you understand now everybody see the church the lukewarm the anything outside of the elected bride will go through the tribulation period they will not they will not raise in the first resurrection the rest of the dead live not for a thousand years just the four ordained elected broad god's own elections who is it brother branham i love this who is it brother burnham he says it's all of this this group here uh he says they were not raised the rest of the dead lived not the four ordained predestinated elected bride god's own choice who is it brother branham i don't know i can't tell you who it is but i know it's going to be there because the lord said they would see they are the ones that will go up from the tribulation but the rest of them will go through the tribulation let's keep going here so let me just say this if brother branham were here today and he was to be asked this same exact question the same exact question will we go through the tribulation will the bride be persecuted will she suffer i will say he would answer it the exact same way he did when he was asked so we don't have time boy i'm really gonna you know say this and then not be able to really clarify but let me just make some statements here even even down to the squeeze that so many people have looked for because of things the prophet of god said but if taken out of context with how he said them now brother matt does that mean you know everything about it no i don't i don't don't know here's there are some things i do know that i can use as anchors the bride doesn't go through the tribulation here's another anchor she doesn't suffer she doesn't have to give her life physically we know that right so we would say that most of so much of what so many people have looked for of this coming squeeze and this pressure that's coming and this ecumenical council that's shutting their church down chasing us down like dogs all of us having to give our all of this mo let me just say this most of everything people have looked for happens in the tribulation period and i don't plan on being here if you don't believe that go listen again i recommend it again the feast of the trumpets there's so much brother branham clarifies with comments he made prior in that message that the bride receives her squeeze she is squeezed in an ecclesia ecclesiastical manner not a physical manner but it's spiritual pressure it's not physical pressure it's spiritual not physical doesn't mean we're not squeezed it's just in a different way and the church will go through that time the tribulation period but not the bride so what is that what is that what is that squeeze that that what what battles us today it's a squeeze to try to uh to try to ban the anointing of god to try to take out the spirit of god out of our churches take away prayer lines take away altar calls take away uh anything like that that that's that's the virus we need to fear brother adam says this in the feast he says what has he done what is it done notice in the cunningness in the cunningness as he said he come in like flatteries what has he done he's bringing the protestant ecumenical council of the world church to the spirit of antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter just like they just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride how loosed in the ecclesiastical church spirit loosed upon what not upon denominations upon the bride but here you'll get it follow close right here but here you'll get it the bride will not go through that time feast of the trumpets he says the bride will not go through that time the bible says not the church will but not the bride can't you ministers can't you see that brethren you say the church has got to go through the persecution for the perfection of it the blood of jesus christ perfects the bride a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishment he's already found grace with her she has found grace with him he engages to her and if there's anything he'll keep her away from every place to turn her hand his grace is so great upon them we ought to be thankful for that his grace is so great upon them and so it will be upon the bride and so it is on the bride we unworthy creatures deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it so we could put a hundred more quotes out here but i think it's so easy for anyone to see if you just have access to the table and if you don't know you can access that online you go to the message hub you go to the table software type in an exact search find exactly what you're looking for if you want to clear some of these things up for yourself so and a lot of people say well you just need revelation you just need to you know order to see this had one brother telling me that we're already in the tribulation brother matt really this is already the trip we already missed the rapture resurrection's already happened dead in christ has already raised we've already missed it all that's what he told me and he said you know you got it you gotta you know you need revelation you need to read between the lines to see the picture what brother adam says i love i personally in study i love reading between the lines you get that from brother branham telling a story about his wife and he was going to go overseas and he says and she wrote a letter and you remember that and he says and i could read between the lines i could read what she was trying to say i love reading between the lines but what i read what we read between the lines must still at least match what's already on the lines must already match it can't can't disagree with what's on it it could further maybe enrich what you're looking at so so uh brother adam says this here let me just keep going here just for a moment that's the reason i do believe that when the bride is called out and elected and said in the book of life there will come a sound from heaven that will take such a baptism of the holy spirit into that bride that will take her from the earth in a rapturing grace god promised it don't care how many science how many astronauts they signed up and everything else how many million miles they can see i don't care nothing about it about that there is a heaven are you glad yes there is a literal jesus christ are you glad that will come in a body form to receive his church to himself no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth god said so that's what believers believe i love that quote here because so many people try to spiritualize the rapture and the coming of the lord and he already came on sunset mountain he's already coming you missed the coming the advent here's here's my thai post this is what believers believe there is a physical return of the lord jesus christ to come and snatch away's bride we're out of time let's stand to our feet thank you jesus for this morning it's lesson lord i pray god that you would settle your word secure it lord plan it and secure it in the hearts of your children lord let it be our stabilization in these uncertain unsettling times let the word be what stabilizes us lord what brings us comfort that's what we're that's what it was sent for you even with the scripture we read in first corinthians 15 so shall we be ever with the lord comfort wherefore comfort one another with these words let it be that today god i pray for the service the music the singing the ministry of your word in jesus name amen
