[28:09] [Music]
[28:12] Lord amen a confession like that that's
[28:16] the work of God in a person's heart the
[28:19] the human nature doesn't want to
[28:22] surrender to the word of God it human
[28:25] nature that we're born with Rebels
[28:27] against the word of God Amen but that's
[28:30] the Holy Spirit moving moving in our
[28:32] hearts I I trust that each one Sayang
[28:35] that with a A True Confession from their
[28:38] lips that they say we're holding nothing
[28:41] back truly whatever it
[28:44] takes and it's going to take a
[28:47] lot he promised he promised that we'll
[28:50] be transforming power he also promised
[28:53] there will be troubles and trials and
[28:56] difficulties and they're going to
[28:58] challenge our faith but he's going to
[29:00] deliver us out of out of or
[29:04] through every one of them amen so we're
[29:07] so thankful for that and um want to it's
[29:11] been a while since I've given a missions
[29:13] report I have three uh trips that I've
[29:16] done since the last time I've uh spoken
[29:20] about the missions trip so we're going
[29:21] to do that tonight and if there's time
[29:23] at the end though I doubt there will be
[29:25] we'll have a short message so let's
[29:28] start by turning to the scriptures we're
[29:30] going to look at Revelation chapter
[29:34] 10 just read one verse
[29:38] there verse
[29:47] 11 and he said unto me thou must
[29:51] prophesy again before many peoples and
[29:55] Nations and tongues and kings amen this
[29:58] is the this is the calling and the
[30:01] commission to the bride of Christ amen
[30:04] at the end time it means there's a great
[30:08] necessity Amen to take
[30:11] this seven seal mystery that's been
[30:14] revealed take it to the Nations amen
[30:19] amen uh Psalm
[30:23] 19
[30:25] and look at verse four
[30:29] I always love this verse because Paul
[30:32] quotes it in the New
[30:34] Testament in uh Romans chapter
[30:37] 10 and he says this is the the preaching
[30:42] of the word has gone out into all the
[30:45] world I always am stand amazed at the
[30:48] revelation of that because if you read
[30:51] psalms 19 it's saying the heavens
[30:53] declare the
[30:54] glory of God and the firmament showeth
[30:59] his handiwork so I guess instead of the
[31:03] heavens declaring the gospel he's put it
[31:06] into human flesh amen that we would take
[31:10] the word and that it would go into all
[31:12] the
[31:13] Earth their line is gone out through all
[31:16] the Earth and their words to the end of
[31:18] the world in them hath he set a
[31:21] tabernacle to the for the sun let's pray
[31:25] father we just come before you now Lord
[31:26] and we're so thankful for your mercy and
[31:29] Grace To Us Lord we we're so thankful
[31:31] that you've chosen to reveal yourself to
[31:34] us Lord this wasn't what we were looking
[31:38] for this wasn't what we were seeking
[31:41] after Lord but you you sought after us
[31:46] you came to us you called us Lord and
[31:49] you if we can really catch the
[31:52] revelation we understand that you
[31:55] yourself have come to teach us amen and
[31:59] reveal yourself to us in this hour Lord
[32:02] to write your word in our heart and in
[32:06] our mind and it wouldn't be like the old
[32:08] Covenant where every man would teach his
[32:11] neighbor but rather we would be taught
[32:13] by you
[32:15] Lord we pray that
[32:18] this secret place Lord that's been made
[32:21] available for us to enter into would
[32:24] become more and more real to us Lord we
[32:28] commit this time with you into your
[32:31] hands Lord For Your Glory we think of
[32:33] those who are not feeling well and all
[32:37] the different things that have been been
[32:38] going around Lord we just rebuke the
[32:41] devil in the name of Jesus Christ and we
[32:43] ask for healing and
[32:46] strengthening to everyone under the
[32:49] sound of the voice Lord we look to you
[32:52] commit ourselves to you in Jesus name
[32:54] amen God bless you you could be seated
[33:03] maybe Doug and Chassidy were welcomed on
[33:06] Sunday but we'll welcome him again amen
[33:09] you were sick my
[33:12] goodness so much sickness going

[33:24] trips since August I was going to give a
[33:27] missions trip before but Tony uh and and
[33:31] the worship team did such a wonderful
[33:33] job I came to the pulpit the an the
[33:35] anointing struck me and I all I could do
[33:36] was preach I couldn't said I can't waste
[33:39] this anointing here that's
[33:40] come on this but I felt the same way
[33:44] coming again today such so appreciative
[33:47] of all the specials and songs and the
[33:50] anointing that yall bring into the
[33:53] service as well um I do want to preach

[35:23] difficulties in the um bathroom
[35:27] situation and food situations and and uh
[35:31] uh I stayed in the Rison blue so I was
[35:34] [Laughter]
[35:37] blessed no no problem and their
[35:40] infrastructure is is quite good in the
[35:43] in the big city of luaka there
[35:48] um this is Brother mul's Church there we
[35:52] had uh six services in his church in in
[35:56] three days and uh Lord really moved I I
[35:59] had on my heart to speak on um a word
[36:03] family to them and uh you know Africa is
[36:07] such a different culture and the
[36:08] struggles and the difficulties they
[36:10] would have in families would be
[36:12] definitely different from here but we
[36:14] find whatever the what whatever the
[36:17] culture is and the difficulties are the
[36:19] word uh answers answers the issues and
[36:23] uh for them the big thing that stood out
[36:25] was realizing the responsibility that a
[36:28] father has uh towards his daughter for
[36:31] them you have a daughter that's just my
[36:34] wife's
[36:35] responsibility and so I for some reason
[36:38] I didn't even know know what it was but
[36:39] the Lord led me really to spend time and
[36:42] focus on that and
[36:45] uh all the deacons and the ministers
[36:48] were there you got to come all around
[36:49] the country to every one of our churches
[36:52] and preach this to us because we don't
[36:54] we don't we don't ever hear anything
[36:55] like this and we really need it
[36:58] um the other thing I learned while I was
[37:01] there and the other the the other topic
[37:04] I I felt led to speak on was seventh
[37:07] seal Oneness
[37:09] restored and
[37:11] um some of them have come into the the
[37:14] revelation of the opening of the word
[37:16] but there's a huge uh group there that
[37:21] is totally totally blind to that and
[37:24] teaching against that um
[37:28] kind of similar circumstances to what I
[37:31] was dealing with with the Iranians with
[37:34] Ewald Frank doctrine that seventh th
[37:37] seventh seal that's all for the Jews
[37:39] that's not for the
[37:40] Gentiles uh it's a seventh trumpet angel
[37:42] it's nothing to do with brother
[37:44] brandham and so that that teaching had
[37:47] gone in and I I uh I didn't really know
[37:49] that I just felt led to preach on it and
[37:52] then we had a ministers meeting
[37:54] afterwards you can see more of the
[37:56] church uh
[37:59] there
[38:01] and uh just wonderful the Lord really
[38:03] moved in the
[38:06] Services Group of Believers there in uh
[38:12] luaka and then we had a u afternoon uh
[38:16] ministers meeting with the brothers and
[38:19] from all over zomia and uh some of the
[38:24] questions that came up were regarding
[38:26] the seventh seal
[38:28] um fairly innocuous questions really
[38:31] nothing that would lead you to think
[38:34] that there was some false teaching going
[38:37] around and the Lord just lend me down
[38:40] the line to tell my testimony of how the
[38:41] Lord dealt with me and dealt with me uh
[38:45] working with Iranian Believers regarding
[38:48] not having any understanding of the
[38:50] seals or their purpose and uh a few of
[38:54] the brothers that caught the Revelation
[38:57] well had already caught the Revelation
[39:00] um I saw them smiling and putting their
[39:02] head down and almost chuckling a little
[39:04] bit like this is too this is too uh too
[39:08] funny because he's he's blasting
[39:11] directly this one and this one and that
[39:13] one and this one and this
[39:15] one and so they're just
[39:19] like and so I thank the Lord because the
[39:22] you know those brothers were eager to
[39:25] stay in contact and want me to come back
[39:27] back and visit so Lord willing I'll be
[39:29] going back for their annual meetings in
[39:32] um in early July for that but the need
[39:36] is great but I'm only one person
[39:41] so anybody that's
[39:43] listening uh like like I did last year
[39:46] for the camp I'll just pray the Holy
[39:49] Spirit sweeps through the ministers here
[39:52] and convict your heart to get out on the
[39:54] missions
[39:55] field Amen brother
[40:01] Luther so after the I think I was four 4
[40:05] days in laka we took through the road I
[40:08] think it was a 10hour drive but you know
[40:12] it's African time so you really don't
[40:14] know what that exactly means um I think
[40:18] it took us about 8 hours to get to the
[40:22] first place though the uh Google Maps
[40:25] said it would be uh five
[40:28] so the first place we hit typical thing
[40:31] you'll see there Ox cart down the road
[40:34] people riding
[40:35] along and we had a service in this
[40:39] church we
[40:41] just brother brother Mulo said we got to
[40:45] hurry the church will be waiting for us
[40:47] we showed up not a soul
[40:50] there and so they started playing music
[40:53] and then the village starts filing into
[40:55] the to the church and
[40:58] went and and preached on overcoming
[41:00] depression and uh Lord really moved in a
[41:04] lot of people's lives things they'd
[41:06] never heard before and and uh soon as I
[41:10] finished preaching went off the platform
[41:13] um spent few minutes speaking with the
[41:16] pastor got in the car and we had another
[41:19] I think 7 hours to get down to
[41:24] Livingstone so was a long day
[41:28] and uh the pastor there in uh Muni
[41:32] Village uh next to
[41:35] Livingstone also does some tour guide
[41:37] work so he took me around he took me to
[41:38] the Livingstone Museum so I got to see
[41:41] different uh David Livingstone artifacts
[41:44] there and things about the history of
[41:47] different uh zombiie and
[41:50] tribes and uh also got they took me over
[41:54] to V Victoria Falls which is
[41:57] pictures don't do it justice but it was
[41:59] a incedible experience to go with the
[42:04] brothers got to hang out with the
[42:06] brothers and some
[42:08] baboons so they're not afraid of people
[42:11] and I guess there's no need for us to be
[42:14] afraid of them although they could tear
[42:16] you up pretty
[42:18] good they on that bridge when you're
[42:20] walking across the bridge they would
[42:22] just run as fast as they could right
[42:24] past your head
[42:29] I didn't I didn't put it in here but one
[42:30] of the baboons crossed the bridge and
[42:32] was kind of going in front of us and he
[42:34] found a Fanta bottle that didn't have
[42:37] the cap on and he sat down and put it
[42:39] back to take a swig I was like my
[42:42] goodness these are Advanced baboons
[42:47] here got a little drop of of some
[42:51] sugar and uh took us to a place where
[42:54] they had all kinds of lions at a park
[42:57] there I had they said they asked me if I
[43:00] wanted to go and walk with the Lions and
[43:02] I said this was good
[43:07] enough we stayed on a hotel on the
[43:09] zambesi just up from Victoria Falls and
[43:13] uh got to see a incredible Sunset
[43:17] there now when we're driving and leave
[43:20] at night the statement is watch out for
[43:23] deer right not in Africa it's it's watch
[43:27] out for
[43:28] elephants and I'm like come again watch
[43:31] out for
[43:33] what
[43:36] elephants so if you don't have your high
[43:38] beams on the way the way elephants do is
[43:40] they in order to moisturize their skin
[43:42] they roll around in mud and so they have
[43:44] that mud on there and if you just have
[43:46] your regular Beam on and are going fast
[43:51] the their their their hide just uh
[43:55] doesn't reflect the light so you don't
[43:57] see them so you have to have your high
[43:58] beams on and kind of drive drive
[44:02] slower that was a pretty neat experience
[44:05] to see him this was just come kind of
[44:07] coming in and out of where our hotel uh
[44:10] was
[44:14] located I don't know what that is let me
[44:17] look on on here and
[44:21] see might be a
[44:24] video or not
[44:28] so this was the little church in mukan
[44:31] Village it was
[44:32] a uh very very interesting experience
[44:36] with them I spoke on the seventh Seal
[44:38] family and uh the pastor was so
[44:41] enthusiastic and I guess they're I was
[44:43] confused because I would say like a
[44:45] sentence and he would talk for two or
[44:48] three minutes and he's running around
[44:49] the church screaming and jumping I
[44:51] turned around and looked at brother Mulo
[44:53] I said what's he doing is he
[44:55] interpreting what I'm saying he's like
[44:57] like yeah he said their their dialect is
[45:00] it's it's like every word you say
[45:02] there's an
[45:03] explanation it's not just the husband is
[45:06] the head of the wife they don't have
[45:08] this word there's a there's a whole
[45:10] sentence that goes for that word head
[45:13] like my goodness forget what I'm
[45:15] preaching on by the time he's
[45:20] done this little guy uh was the pastor's
[45:25] son and uh
[45:28] he came up to me after service and and
[45:30] he said
[45:32] uh when are you leaving I said tomorrow
[45:36] I have to be at the airport tomorrow
[45:37] around noon and he said okay when I'm
[45:42] done with school you come pick
[45:46] me I was like I don't know buddy I I'm
[45:50] so sorry I don't think I don't think I
[45:52] can do it no no you come pick me I go I
[45:55] go with you
[45:58] no I can't so he came I got in the
[46:00] vehicle he come around and he just
[46:01] looked up at me with the big eye big
[46:05] eyes
[46:06] and when school is done you come pick
[46:10] me like I don't think it's going to work
[46:13] but I'm almost
[46:19] convinced so just uh tremendous
[46:22] experience this this pastor his uh uncle
[46:25] is the chief of their Village and if
[46:28] you're not familiar uh you know they
[46:31] they they have their elected government
[46:34] there but then they also have Chiefs and
[46:37] those Chiefs are in control of I mean
[46:40] unbelievable vast territories they they
[46:43] control the land and so he was saying
[46:47] now I I want you to come back and meet
[46:49] the chief and he'll give you some land
[46:52] and you can develop
[46:53] it he's like as many hectars as you want
[46:57] and I'm like that's not that's not my
[46:59] business I don't i' be glad to meet the
[47:02] chief but I don't need any
[47:06] land don't get any ideas about going
[47:09] with
[47:14] me but just just tremendous for for me
[47:18] after going to the Middle East for so
[47:21] long and dealing with a little bit tough
[47:24] people to deal with going to uh Zombia
[47:28] was like the one of the biggest breath
[47:31] of fresh air for me that I've ever
[47:33] experienced um totally just fell in love
[47:37] with all the people there and I can't
[47:40] not go
[47:44] back
[47:45] the now the whole time I told the
[47:48] brother the pastor make sure that this
[47:52] pastor in mukan Village uh books me on a
[47:56] Safari I can't there's no possibility I
[47:59] can go to Africa and not at least drive
[48:02] around and see some animals oh yeah yeah
[48:04] yeah yeah they'll do that they'll do
[48:05] that day whole day goes by it's like are
[48:07] we doing that next we doing that next
[48:08] we're doing that next oh yeah yeah yeah
[48:10] where are we going now back to the hotel
[48:13] okay so I went to the hotel and spoke
[48:16] with them and the next morning at like
[48:18] 6:00 a.m. they had a time for us to go
[48:20] so I could do it before um getting on to
[48:23] the the plane to head to South Africa so
[48:27] got to see
[48:29] hippos and zebra they don't they in this
[48:32] particular Park they don't have any uh
[48:35] Predators so if Predators come in they
[48:38] they uh trap them or whatever they do
[48:41] probably uh tranquilize them and take
[48:44] them out on the other side of the fence
[48:47] um they do come in because they can
[48:48] cross the river but the rest of it is
[48:51] kind of fenced off so this was a
[48:54] interesting
[48:55] experience uh
[48:57] the the drivers were taking us around
[48:59] and showing us different things they
[49:00] said do you want to do a rhino walk and
[49:02] I was like yeah yeah absolutely so you
[49:04] get to the Rhino and the Rhino are
[49:07] actually guarded by people 24/7 365
[49:12] there's never not a time because people
[49:14] poachers come and saw off their their um
[49:19] horn and it's used for medicine in
[49:22] China so they the the the guy asked us
[49:27] do you know what these who these guns
[49:29] are for and I was like uh I don't know
[49:33] the Rhinos they're like oh no these
[49:35] wouldn't touch a rhino these are for the
[49:40] poachers and so they're there um and so
[49:43] when you go they they put one of the
[49:48] um gay morens walking with you so we're
[49:52] walking and we go and finally as we get
[49:55] back to the vehicle after the walk
[49:57] brother Mulo says hey do I know you to
[50:00] this this this fell and he's like yeah
[50:03] we know each other you're this person
[50:04] you're this person and here here it was
[50:07] a message believer that's a
[50:09] preacher that goes around the country as
[50:11] a game Arden so I got his contact in
[50:15] information we've been in touch ever
[50:17] since I always have him send me some
[50:19] photos or something from something that
[50:20] he's doing so he goes all around this
[50:24] affords him because they do like few
[50:26] days on a few days off so it affords
[50:28] them time to preach in different
[50:31] areas and so that was a neat experience
[50:33] then we forward to
[50:36] November um went to uh Cambodia this is
[50:41] Pham pen is where we flew into so it was
[50:44] quite an adventure um I've never gone
[50:48] that direction before so uh 12 hours
[50:53] difference
[50:54] and uh and it's it's a long flight from
[50:58] Atlanta to to
[51:00] Korea and then uh it's another like 5
[51:03] and 1 half 6 hour flight from um soul to
[51:09] pen we we uh we got into the airport
[51:13] late and brother Brent who was traveling
[51:16] with or I was traveling with him um from
[51:19] Brother Eugene's Church his uh luggage
[51:21] didn't come so we were we got to the
[51:23] hotel at like 2:00 a.m. and didn't get
[51:27] to bed till 3:00 a.m. and the brother
[51:29] brother Paul said that picked us up said
[51:32] um we got to leave at 6:00 a.m.
[51:35] for uh the next town that we're going to
[51:38] I was like okay how long's the drive
[51:40] he's like 12
[51:42] hours ah okay so very little sleep and
[51:46] and and lots of time and this was the
[51:49] bus that they put us on with about 20
[51:52] Filipinos and there was no business that
[51:54] 20 people should have been on
[51:58] this in this
[52:00] van and the seats were definitely made
[52:02] for little people what what what I found
[52:07] with cambodians and Vietnamese and uh
[52:11] Lao um their men are about the size of
[52:16] Avery and
[52:17] Mina uh no joke and
[52:21] little and their their women are like
[52:24] just a little bit bigger than Addie
[52:26] so they're just tiny so they fit in
[52:28] these seats uh they gave two seats to
[52:31] Brent and I and neither of us were
[52:33] barely on the seat and I was already
[52:36] suffering in pain so about halfway
[52:38] through I said I can't I can't go on
[52:40] this hurts too much I I I can't do it so
[52:43] the somebody came and picked me up then
[52:45] I could be in a vehicle for the last uh
[52:47] four or five hours but it was this was a
[52:50] soft form of torture I would have told
[52:52] you anything that you wanted to know to
[52:54] get out of it
[52:59] brother
[53:00] Paul uh there from from pen uh he's he's
[53:05] doing missions work all through
[53:07] southeast Asia he's doing missions work
[53:10] uh with Vietnamese people with Laos he's
[53:14] he's Cambodian but he's he's um also
[53:18] speaks Le
[53:21] oian so he's been doing translation work
[53:24] into uh Le ocean and doing Outreach so
[53:28] this has been kind of a a very New
[53:31] Missions work in the last uh seven seven
[53:35] or eight years Co really slowed things
[53:38] down but I think the last meeting that
[53:41] brother Brent went to um was 2019 and
[53:46] they had about 20 people there for the
[53:49] meetings just a just a just a start
[53:53] really for the missions work but this
[53:55] time um Brother Paul's been working hard
[53:58] and traveling a lot through the country
[53:59] and in contact with people uh in Vietnam
[54:04] denominational Christians leading them
[54:06] to the message and so he's been doing a
[54:08] great job I think every meal is
[54:12] f breakfast is f lunch is f dinner is f
[54:16] which I like so it was
[54:18] good and you see that little tiny dish
[54:21] on the left that was our that was the
[54:23] meal and that's why I found out there're
[54:25] so little is cuz their dishes are like
[54:31] that I had to eat you know about four or
[54:35] five of them to make for what American
[54:37] normally eats but it's good
[54:42] food Buddhist Buddhist monk crossing the
[54:45] street see that quite a bit in in this
[54:48] particular um in Cambodia to have a have
[54:52] a meeting the way that we had with so
[54:54] many people there you got to get the
[54:56] agreement of the Christian Bishop the uh
[55:01] Buddhist manager and the police on our
[55:05] way the
[55:06] Buddhist um manager backed out and said
[55:10] you can't have your meetings so we're
[55:12] like four hours out after all this
[55:14] misery and we can't have the meetings I
[55:16] just said brother Paul we're going to
[55:18] pray there's no way that the Lord sent
[55:20] me through all this to get here to have
[55:23] it canceled so don't worry about it
[55:26] we're going to pray and we'll rebuke the
[55:27] devil and meetings will be fine
[55:30] tomorrow and they and they
[55:33] were um I think it took about $100 to
[55:36] pay the Buddhist uh manager
[55:40] but the Lord made
[55:42] his the Lord made his heart
[55:47] willing and I think about uh 25 R
[55:53] 25 uh Filipino Saints came with to
[55:57] support the meetings uh brother Nestor
[55:59] and some other ministers uh came as well
[56:03] really blessing to get to know them and
[56:05] fellowship with
[56:09] them brother brother Paul there was
[56:12] three services a day for four days and
[56:16] brother Paul translated every single one
[56:18] of them have no idea how he still had a
[56:21] voice at the end
[56:28] oh and yeah but did I mention Cambodia
[56:30] is hot very
[56:33] hot but it was open they had fans going
[56:36] and the breeze was coming through so
[56:37] that really did take some of it off but
[56:41] very hot very
[56:46] humid that's the all the ministers that
[56:49] were there from the
[56:51] Philippines um
[56:54] from uh Cambodia from Laos and from
[56:59] Vietnam so Vietnam there's really not a
[57:03] a good possibility for anyone to go
[57:06] there and openly hold
[57:09] meetings um the way that they it's a
[57:12] Communist Regime and they're not at all
[57:15] open to any of that some brothers over
[57:17] over time you may have heard different
[57:18] testimonies going there and a number of
[57:22] Believers from Europe from um new
[57:26] Zealand from Australia have been
[57:29] arrested or almost arrested in um in
[57:32] Vietnam so it was a great blessing these
[57:34] brothers could come over I think the
[57:36] Border was just 15 or 20 minutes away
[57:38] from where we held the meetings there in
[57:41] Northeast Cambodia um so from there and
[57:44] also I think there was uh three or four
[57:47] brothers from
[57:50] La they got me a 2XL shirt
[57:56] Cambodia sizes are very
[57:58] different I think I need to lose
[58:01] another 200 PBS in order to get in that
[58:05] one get down to about 70 pounds and I'll
[58:08] fit
[58:13] it that was the picture of all everybody
[58:15] there was at the
[58:17] meeting so quite a quite a growth of the
[58:20] message there in that area in the last
[58:24] five or six years much to do so so
[58:26] remember brother Paul in prayer he's
[58:28] he's a busy man and uh could use
[58:32] definitely could use some more
[58:33] support and could use so the Holy Spirit
[58:38] to sweep through your hearts and send
[58:40] you
[58:41] to Cambodia because there's really isn't
[58:44] a lot of brothers doing missions work in
[58:46] this part of Southeast
[58:49] Asia so morbid picture but this is uh uh
[58:55] the called The Killing Fields Cambodia
[58:58] back in the 70s and 80s P pot um brought
[59:03] brought the
[59:05] um more upper class middle class people
[59:09] uh into these um areas that were like uh
[59:14] cordoned off and hidden off and did a
[59:17] lot of tricks to hide what was happening
[59:20] but they just they didn't use bullets or
[59:25] or knives or anything they just used
[59:27] farm implements to murder millions of
[59:31] people um at this particular place it
[59:34] was hundreds of thousands when it
[59:37] sometimes when it's heavy rains there's
[59:39] still bones coming up out of the mud and
[59:43] and dirt that they're finding and
[59:45] it's h it was it's horrific what the
[59:48] people there went
[59:51] through so went to the you can go into
[59:54] the palace
[59:56] area there not into the palace but the
[59:58] grounds of the palace and see that so I
[1:00:02] had a couple hours before my flight so I
[1:00:04] had to to see something
[1:00:08] right wonderful time I just enjoyed the
[1:00:11] fellowship for our breakfasts and our
[1:00:14] dinners with the Philip Filipino Saints
[1:00:16] um just really really precious I have to
[1:00:20] I have to be careful because I'm going
[1:00:22] to want to go to the Philippines really
[1:00:24] bad after meeting them
[1:00:26] but there's a lot of work to do in the
[1:00:28] Middle East
[1:00:29] so then a very unexpected trip to
[1:00:34] Uganda um earlier in the year I had a
[1:00:37] conversation with brother Abraham and he
[1:00:42] he said uh I had mentioned wanting to
[1:00:44] get get to Uganda and was kind of asking
[1:00:48] him about some of the different
[1:00:49] invitations that I had from different
[1:00:52] people and he said well why don't you
[1:00:53] come visit
[1:00:54] me and I said oh well when he's like oh
[1:00:57] the year's taken up but I don't know
[1:00:59] maybe the end of the year we have
[1:01:00] meetings at at at at New Year's maybe
[1:01:04] that'll work for you and I said maybe we
[1:01:05] can talk
[1:01:06] later and for for him that
[1:01:10] was you're coming I'll give you the
[1:01:13] details later for me that was we'll talk
[1:01:16] later so December 15th here's the
[1:01:20] details
[1:01:23] uh I'm not coming
[1:01:26] says brother it's
[1:01:28] devastating we we we have we have 10
[1:01:31] services and I have one Minister I need
[1:01:34] I need someone else to come and it'll be
[1:01:35] impossible to find someone I could
[1:01:38] preach but the people are wanting you
[1:01:40] know some visitors to come they hear me
[1:01:42] preach all the time oh brother I I
[1:01:45] thought you I thought you were coming
[1:01:48] and uh you know I've heard that heard
[1:01:51] things like this before and just said
[1:01:56] I'm not coming but something convicted
[1:01:58] me this time and the Lord was working
[1:02:00] working beforehand and ended up
[1:02:03] surrendering to the call to go to Uganda
[1:02:06] last minute right after Christmas and uh
[1:02:09] was an incredible uh experience to be
[1:02:12] able to go to Uganda see um beautiful
[1:02:16] people there and The beautiful landscape
[1:02:19] there um brother Tony let me borrow his
[1:02:23] his drone so I could get some different
[1:02:26] shots in the area and that's brother
[1:02:29] Abraham's Church there they're adding on
[1:02:31] to it it's a it's a work in
[1:02:34] progress um so keep them in prayer but
[1:02:38] um there was about I would say there's
[1:02:41] about 700 7 or 800 people that were at
[1:02:44] the meeting they kind of have them in
[1:02:46] different
[1:02:47] areas uh sitting we had 10 Services on
[1:02:51] Two on Sunday three Monday three Tuesday
[1:02:55] two
[1:02:56] on Wednesday and then we had to get
[1:02:59] after service we had to eat get in the
[1:03:01] car and go back to
[1:03:03] kalala it's quite a whirl
[1:03:06] whirlwind
[1:03:08] trip but amazing experience just
[1:03:11] preaching to the Saints there um how
[1:03:14] they pull on the word and their their
[1:03:17] hearts are just
[1:03:20] always the Lord the Lord deals with him
[1:03:23] and it's amazing to see him come forward
[1:03:25] and and pray and pour their hearts
[1:03:27] hearts out to the Lord after every after
[1:03:29] every
[1:03:35] message
[1:03:36] um that's outside of brother Abraham's
[1:03:39] house I don't know if you've heard the
[1:03:40] testimony but um a group of Believers in
[1:03:44] Europe went together and built him this
[1:03:47] this house his house before I don't know
[1:03:50] if you could see it on this picture yeah
[1:03:52] just to the left of the church was his
[1:03:57] house where he lived before so that is
[1:04:01] just a about a block um that
[1:04:05] direction um or this direction if you're
[1:04:07] looking at that one is where his house
[1:04:10] is and um they they built it for him
[1:04:13] it's it's a nice house for hosting
[1:04:16] people and it was uh great blessing to
[1:04:19] him
[1:04:26] every me every meal three meals a day
[1:04:29] with myself and brother Abraham and
[1:04:31] brother Burley please don't be jealous
[1:04:33] about the fellowship I had with these
[1:04:36] brothers but it that that was for me
[1:04:39] that was as much of a blessing as every
[1:04:41] part of it um brother Abraham every
[1:04:45] night starts playing his guitar the
[1:04:47] family gathers around they they sing and
[1:04:51] uh read the scripture and he preaches
[1:04:53] for 15 20 minutes
[1:04:56] and everybody prays together and then I
[1:04:59] was just finally getting deep sleep and
[1:05:02] about 5:00 a.m. the guitar starts
[1:05:05] strumming and I was like do I have to
[1:05:10] go service services in a few hours and I
[1:05:14] barely slept I went and shut the door
[1:05:17] went to sleep but it was such a
[1:05:19] inspiration to me to see that and how he
[1:05:22] does that and how faithful to that I
[1:05:24] asked the kids oh uh you you guys always
[1:05:28] do that evening and morning he's like
[1:05:30] for 30
[1:05:33] years so it's
[1:05:37] amazing got a got a
[1:05:40] um some pretty neat footage from the
[1:05:42] Drone I wish I could put it in here but
[1:05:45] just uh was a tremendous experience for
[1:05:48] me spending time with brother Abraham
[1:05:51] and seeing his church and seeing Uganda
[1:05:54] meeting the people was is uh very very
[1:05:57] blessed um I can't believe it but I have
[1:06:00] 15 minutes to
[1:06:02] preach so I'm going to bring up my notes
[1:06:06] and we'll go to that um with that said I
[1:06:11] do have a missions trip coming up to
[1:06:13] Egypt I'll be going for two weeks uh
[1:06:16] leave on the 27th and we'll be there
[1:06:19] until the uh 10th of February so please
[1:06:23] remember me in prayer and that work in
[1:06:24] prayer the
[1:06:26] the open doors amongst the Pentecostal
[1:06:29] churches that I went to uh last March is
[1:06:33] is still open and Lord willing I'm
[1:06:36] trying to there's they have 70 churches
[1:06:38] that they've opened the door to me too
[1:06:40] Lord willing I think we're doing 15
[1:06:43] churches this time so just do the math
[1:06:46] we'll try to get through that God
[1:06:48] willing in 2025 if if if it's his plan
[1:06:52] for
[1:06:54] us so let's turn in the scripture to
[1:06:59] Revelation
[1:07:02] 10 verse
[1:07:17] 8 and the voice which I I heard from
[1:07:21] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[1:07:23] and take the little book which is open
[1:07:26] in the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:07:27] upon the sea and upon the Earth and I
[1:07:30] went unto the angel and said unto him
[1:07:31] give me the little book and he said unto
[1:07:33] me take it and eat it up and it shall
[1:07:35] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[1:07:37] thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[1:07:40] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[1:07:42] ate it up and it was in my mouth as
[1:07:44] sweet as honey and as soon as I had
[1:07:46] eaten it my belly was bitter and he said
[1:07:48] unto me thou must
[1:07:50] prophesy again before many peoples and
[1:07:53] Nations and tongues and kings and so we
[1:07:57] notice then that we John being a type of
[1:08:00] the Bride that we have to take of course
[1:08:03] thises and symbols we understand it's
[1:08:06] not a literal book that we take and eat
[1:08:10] but it is taking the revelation of the
[1:08:13] word and spiritually assimilating that
[1:08:18] not just in our brains but at the depth
[1:08:21] of our very soul and so it's it's
[1:08:24] feeding on that word so that Revelation
[1:08:28] upon Revelation upon Revelation is added
[1:08:32] to to to our soul to bring us to the
[1:08:36] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:08:37] of
[1:08:40] Christ and so then out of that it's not
[1:08:44] it's not enough to just do that because
[1:08:47] there's a next step to that and the next
[1:08:50] step to that is the word that you've
[1:08:52] assimilated must come out of your lips
[1:08:57] it's not enough to talk about your
[1:09:01] inheritance you you have to speak what
[1:09:04] your inheritance has given
[1:09:07] you the the word that we've been
[1:09:09] delivered is not all not only a
[1:09:13] revelation that gives us knowledge
[1:09:15] that's fantastic that has to start that
[1:09:18] way but it's not supposed to finish that
[1:09:21] way number one is it's going to produce
[1:09:24] a certain kind of life
[1:09:25] number two it's going to produce a
[1:09:27] certain kind of word coming forth from
[1:09:29] our
[1:09:32] lips and that that is a great portion of
[1:09:36] the third
[1:09:38] pole in the seventh seal I think you can
[1:09:41] bring up can you bring up that uh
[1:09:43] PowerPoint again at the very end there's
[1:09:45] some quotes I'm just going to start
[1:09:46] reading if you can get it I think it's
[1:09:49] just towards the end right after that um
[1:09:51] Sunset
[1:09:53] picture has been 7even years years
[1:09:56] ago said don't try to explain that said
[1:10:00] this is the third pool but I'll meet you
[1:10:02] in there that
[1:10:04] right I was standing with a little baby
[1:10:07] shoe when he told me said now make your
[1:10:10] first pull and when you do the fish will
[1:10:12] run after the lure said then watch your
[1:10:14] second pull said because it'll only be
[1:10:16] small fish he said then the third poll
[1:10:19] we will get we will we'll get it and all
[1:10:23] the ministers got around me said brother
[1:10:25] brandham we know you can do it
[1:10:26] Hallelujah brother brandham that's where
[1:10:28] how he's got tied up with a bunch of
[1:10:29] preachers see I love people they want
[1:10:32] you to explain everything this and
[1:10:36] that I said well uh uh uh said I don't
[1:10:39] know said I've understand fishing now I
[1:10:43] said now the first thing you do here's
[1:10:44] the way it's done you see all the fish
[1:10:46] around you got the jerk The Lure well
[1:10:48] that's exactly the tactics of fishing so
[1:10:49] I said jerk The Lure now you see when I
[1:10:51] jerk The Lure first time now the fish
[1:10:53] takes it out after it but they they were
[1:10:55] little ones and that's just like they
[1:10:57] were catching so then I said then then
[1:11:00] you'll set and I jerked it out on the
[1:11:02] bank and I had a fish but it looked like
[1:11:04] a skin Over The Lure it was just was so
[1:11:06] little and I was standing there and
[1:11:08] something said I told you not to do that
[1:11:11] I started crying all the line was
[1:11:13] Tangled around me like this I was
[1:11:15] standing there crying with my head down
[1:11:17] like that I said God oh forgive me I'm a
[1:11:20] stupid person Lord please forgive me and
[1:11:23] I had this line and then and that when I
[1:11:26] had in my hand was a little baby shoe
[1:11:29] about that long and I had the string was
[1:11:31] about as big as around as my finger
[1:11:33] about half an inch like and the eyelid
[1:11:36] in the shoe this shoe was just about the
[1:11:39] size 1116 probably of an inch in the
[1:11:41] eyelet and I was trying to lace this
[1:11:43] little shoe up this great big inch cord
[1:11:46] and a voice come and says now you can't
[1:11:47] teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural
[1:11:51] things said now let them
[1:11:54] alone and just then he picked he picked
[1:11:56] me up he he took me up and sit me way up
[1:12:00] high to where a meeting was going on
[1:12:02] looked like a tent or a cathedral or
[1:12:04] some sort and I looked and there was a
[1:12:06] little box like little place over in the
[1:12:08] side and I seen the that light was
[1:12:11] talking to somebody above me that light
[1:12:13] that you see there on the picture it
[1:12:15] Whirled away from me like that and went
[1:12:17] over that tent and said I'll meet you
[1:12:20] there said this will be the third poll
[1:12:23] and you won't tell it to nobody
[1:12:25] and in sepino Canyon he said this is the
[1:12:28] third pole and there's three great
[1:12:30] things that goes with it now he's going
[1:12:33] back to the seals he's telling his
[1:12:35] testimony he's talking about the vision
[1:12:38] and he's telling us the little room the
[1:12:42] tent in other in other ones it says that
[1:12:45] light left
[1:12:46] me and went down to that little room and
[1:12:50] the people went in that little room and
[1:12:53] they come out totally he
[1:12:55] what happened I don't
[1:12:58] know I can't explain brother brandham
[1:13:01] says in sepino can Sabino Canyon he told
[1:13:05] me this is the third
[1:13:11] pool now he's going to go back and bring
[1:13:14] this back into the seventh seal that
[1:13:17] he's preaching on and he says and
[1:13:19] there's three things that goes with it
[1:13:22] and one unfolded today or yesterday the
[1:13:25] the other one folded today and there's
[1:13:27] one thing that I cannot interpret
[1:13:29] because it's in an unknown language but
[1:13:32] I stand right there looks right straight
[1:13:34] at it and this is the third pull coming
[1:13:38] up and the Holy Spirit of God oh
[1:13:42] my so there I'll bring that there so if
[1:13:47] we begin to look at this and and
[1:13:51] understand what he's speaking about
[1:13:53] there in in simplicity not thinking
[1:13:56] trying to explain every single detail
[1:13:58] but if we understand there's a change
[1:14:01] that takes place under the third pole by
[1:14:04] going into a secret place and the angel
[1:14:07] pointed out to brother brandham and said
[1:14:09] when you pray go into the secret
[1:14:12] place and ask your father heavenly
[1:14:15] father in secret and he'll reward you
[1:14:18] openly so going in there and that Pillar
[1:14:21] of Fire meeting the people in there not
[1:14:24] knowing what happened but coming out
[1:14:26] totally changed and transformed and this
[1:14:29] is the third
[1:14:32] poll what is the third poll it's the
[1:14:35] opening of the
[1:14:36] word brother brandham says says this on
[1:14:39] a number of occasions and a number of
[1:14:41] different ways through 63 64 and
[1:14:45] 65 third poll is the opening of the word
[1:14:48] so when we realize these symbols that
[1:14:50] are bringing forth are symbols that are
[1:14:53] connected to uh scriptural event that's
[1:14:57] taking
[1:14:58] place and of course we understand when
[1:15:02] the seven Thunders utter their voices
[1:15:04] they're not bringing a new
[1:15:06] revelation they're bringing biblical
[1:15:09] truth to the Forefront once again
[1:15:12] they're taking the things that were left
[1:15:15] off through the reformers Gathering
[1:15:18] those Revelations together and making it
[1:15:21] presenting it openly to the bride in
[1:15:25] other words it's the fullness of the New
[1:15:27] Covenant totally restored back to
[1:15:31] us and so it's going to take that those
[1:15:34] seven Thunders which the prophet says
[1:15:37] that the the the seven Thunder Mysteries
[1:15:41] is what will restore the church back to
[1:15:44] the original faith and it's something
[1:15:47] that is not
[1:15:49] written and yet it's a scriptural
[1:15:51] Revelation it's from Genesis to
[1:15:53] revelation God making known the
[1:15:55] Mysteries to his
[1:15:58] people brother bam
[1:16:00] says in the seventh seal he says don't
[1:16:02] try to interpret the things don't try to
[1:16:06] do anything more than just live a close
[1:16:08] Life Giving praise and honor to Jesus
[1:16:14] Christ don't interpret
[1:16:17] it turn with me to John chapter
[1:16:23] 6 and verse 44
[1:16:27] four I'm going to have to go fast cuz I
[1:16:30] have to be done no man can come to me
[1:16:33] except the Father which has sent me draw
[1:16:36] draw him and I will raise him up at the
[1:16:39] last day amen so it's a sovereign work
[1:16:44] of God he is the one that does the
[1:16:46] drawing it's not us that does the
[1:16:49] choosing it's him that does the
[1:16:53] choosing it's not it's not us that we
[1:16:56] sought God but it's rather that God went
[1:16:59] out and sought us and Drew us to the
[1:17:03] reality of the revelation of Jesus
[1:17:05] Christ verse 45 it is written in the
[1:17:08] prophets and they shall be all taught of
[1:17:12] God every man therefore that hath heard
[1:17:15] and ha learned of the father cometh unto
[1:17:18] me not that any man has seen the father
[1:17:21] say save he which is of god he has seen
[1:17:24] the father
[1:17:26] my
[1:17:27] goodness so the purpose of
[1:17:31] Christ and why he came was so that all
[1:17:36] the children of God would be taught of
[1:17:40] God this goes right back to the New
[1:17:43] Covenant we'll read it in in a
[1:17:46] minute so we're not to interpret the
[1:17:48] things
[1:17:49] ourselves we live a Godly Christian Life
[1:17:55] and God will teach it to you amen he
[1:17:58] says it's not to be known to the public
[1:18:02] he said he says I got in trouble before
[1:18:05] and I messed things up and I Tangled
[1:18:06] myself up in all this
[1:18:08] line because I tried to explain the
[1:18:11] details to
[1:18:12] everybody he says I'll take it to my
[1:18:15] grave there's three things one unfolded
[1:18:19] he said under the Sixth Seal it's the SE
[1:18:23] the coming of the son of of man the
[1:18:25] Angels wouldn't know anything about it
[1:18:26] but it's the coming of the son of
[1:18:28] man this the second part will be the
[1:18:32] seven Thunder
[1:18:33] mystery right and the third part came in
[1:18:36] an unknown language and I couldn't make
[1:18:39] it out and I'll I won't interpret it and
[1:18:41] I'll take it to my
[1:18:44] grave so it won't be known to the
[1:18:48] public don't interpret it but live a
[1:18:51] Godly Christian Life don't be a fanatic
[1:18:55] amen I I think we can all see the great
[1:18:59] prophetic voice that was in those
[1:19:01] utterances that came off because what
[1:19:03] have people done they've been a
[1:19:05] fanatic they tried to bring their own
[1:19:07] interpretation of everything instead of
[1:19:10] let letting brother brandham interpret
[1:19:11] his own words which he does read Christ
[1:19:14] as the mystery of God revealed and
[1:19:16] you'll find
[1:19:17] out the
[1:19:20] secret what is the secret
[1:19:27] Daniel 12 I'm just going to go very fast
[1:19:29] Daniel this is 4 through1 if you want to
[1:19:32] write it down but Daniel Comes he sees a
[1:19:35] vision he's told Daniel shut up the
[1:19:37] words and seal the book even to the time
[1:19:39] of the the end then he goes forward and
[1:19:42] he
[1:19:43] says I heard but I understood
[1:19:46] not what what what will will the end of
[1:19:49] these things be my Lord go your way
[1:19:51] Daniel the words are SE are closed up
[1:19:54] and sealed till the time of the end so
[1:19:57] what is the sealing it's a sealed away
[1:20:00] from the
[1:20:02] understanding amen the revelation of the
[1:20:05] word to our hearts was sealed off but
[1:20:09] then it says many will be purified and
[1:20:11] made white and tried but the wicked
[1:20:13] shall do wickedly and none of the wicked
[1:20:16] shall understand but the wise shall
[1:20:20] understand so this mysterious book
[1:20:22] that's sealed up is going to be broken
[1:20:25] open and it's going to be revealed to
[1:20:28] the hearts of the
[1:20:35] wise in seventh seal brother bam says
[1:20:37] the end time seal when it starts will be
[1:20:39] absolutely a total secret according to
[1:20:42] the Bible before knowing that and
[1:20:44] remember Revelation 10 1-7 chapter 10
[1:20:47] 1:7 at the end of the seventh Angel's
[1:20:50] message all the mysteries of God will be
[1:20:52] known so it starts out as a secret but
[1:20:54] it doesn't finish that
[1:20:56] way it finishes as as a revelation of
[1:21:00] the word to the bride last one Hebrews 8
[1:21:04] musicians if you want to
[1:21:09] come Hebrews 8
[1:21:13] 8-13 for finding fault with them he
[1:21:16] saith behold the days come sayith the
[1:21:18] Lord when I will make a New Covenant
[1:21:19] with the house of Israel and with the
[1:21:21] house of Judah not according to the
[1:21:23] Covenant that I made with their fathers
[1:21:25] in the day when I took them by the hand
[1:21:27] to lead them out of the land of Egypt
[1:21:29] because they continued not in my
[1:21:30] Covenant and I regarded them not sayi
[1:21:32] the Lord for this is the Covenant that I
[1:21:35] will make with the house of Israel after
[1:21:37] those days sayeth the Lord listen I will
[1:21:40] put my laws into their mind and write
[1:21:43] them in their hearts and I will be to
[1:21:45] them a God and they shall be to me a
[1:21:47] people and they shall not teach every
[1:21:50] man his neighbor it'll be in an unknown
[1:21:53] language they'll not teach every man his
[1:21:56] neighbor and every man his brother
[1:21:58] saying know the Lord For All Shall know
[1:22:01] me from the least to the greatest for I
[1:22:04] will be merciful to their
[1:22:05] unrighteousness and their sins and their
[1:22:07] iniquities will I remember no more in
[1:22:10] that he saith a New Covenant he hath
[1:22:11] made the first old now that which
[1:22:13] decayeth and waxeth old is ready to
[1:22:16] vanish away so it's the the
[1:22:19] fullness of the New Covenant which is
[1:22:22] what Christ revealed in the fullness in
[1:22:25] his
[1:22:26] bride the Oneness of Christ and his
[1:22:30] bride the the bride has a secret she has
[1:22:33] the
[1:22:36] word she she is one with the word she's
[1:22:40] taken the book she's eaten it and she's
[1:22:43] prophesying again that's where the
[1:22:46] transforming power that's where the
[1:22:47] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:22:50] of Christ comes from is from the
[1:22:52] revelation of the word that's the New
[1:22:55] Covenant that's the teacher he's in you
[1:22:58] revealing the hidden secrets amen let's

[1:32:56] morning and um rolled over on my back
[1:32:59] and felt like the room was spinning and
[1:33:01] I opened my eyes and there was a there's
[1:33:04] a picture hanging or a little mirror
[1:33:05] hanging on my wall in my bedroom and it
[1:33:09] looked like there was 15 mirrors on the
[1:33:11] wall and they were all spinning a 100
[1:33:13] different directions oh my and I closed
[1:33:16] my eyes really quick and I sat up in the
[1:33:18] bed and I put my hands over my face and
[1:33:20] I said Jesus please help me and I
[1:33:22] started sweating and I was like what is
[1:33:24] wrong with me and then it thought hit me
[1:33:27] I've got vertigo I never had that before
[1:33:30] I hope I never have it again but I laid
[1:33:33] back down and when I did it started all
[1:33:34] over again so I sat up in the bed and I
[1:33:37] I prayed for a minute and then I called
[1:33:38] Brad and I said you got to pray for me I
[1:33:40] said I think I've got vertigo I said
[1:33:42] it's really bad and he prayed and it
