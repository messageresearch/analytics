we're going to go right to the Book of Romans chapter 12 tonight I'll bet you can guess what I'm going to preach on Amen we're going to take our 13th I say it and can't believe it installment tonight and um the Lord willing unless the Rapture comes or I get uh hijacked by the Lord we'll be taking uh hopefully the I'm not gonna say the on I'll be taking part 14 yeah we're going be taking part 14 on Sunday amen praise the Lord so quite intentionally tonight I'm not going to get into Sunday material do one of those um instant stops tonight like we had Sunday praise the Lord you'd have been here you'd have been here how much how long it takes me to preach tonight is how much longer you would have been here on Sunday amen so you'll be glad I stopped amen give you a fresh mind tonight Romans chapter 12 amen we're going to catch two verses here very poignant very instructive very powerful very direct for us especially those people I'll promise you you are and um everything points to it and there's not even anything to contradict that so we know where we stand amen I'm glad for that praise God Romans chapter 12 verses 1 and two I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God boy it's going to take the mercies of God to pull this off I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye in the worst possible age of all human history breaking all records present your bodies a Living Sacrifice Amen in the age where it's the most completely impossible and Unthinkable unimaginable and you can't even believe you're still here holy acceptable unto God holy comma acceptable unto God so there's more to being acceptable unto God than just being holy which is which which is your reasonable service so when you've done the impossible and you've you you've you've you've stood and stood true in the age of impossibility it's just a reasonable service so don't cry amen there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but within every one of those God makes a way of Escape that you may that you may Escape it now he doesn't say you will escape it he says you could I'm going to make a way and you may Escape it but it'll be up to you but if you do it it'll be by the mercies of God how many want his Mercy tonight now let's go a little further and be not conformed to this world whatever you do don't look like it talk like it act like it think like it run with it sociate with it marry into it be a part of it amen be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind mind because I'm going to give you the mind of Christ you know I like my mind pretty good and the only one I would want more is his not too interested in getting yours I would like to have his amen I want the mind of Christ I want to have my mind transformed into his mind be not conformed to this world but be it transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good oh friends you're going to hear the heart of my of part 13 tonight that ye may prove that ye may prove what is that good because everybody's got an opinion oh yes amen about what's good and bad yeah everybody's got an opinion about what is truth and not truth see but there's going to have to be somebody to prove what actually is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God tag you're it hallelujah amen amen let's pray Lord thank you for your instantaneous anointing that I feel father I just commit myself into your hands tonight let the word come forth Lord in power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit spirit let it be instructive Lord let it repr reprove and rebuke if necessary but Lord let it not just uh show us the problem we already know there's lots of problems and we're part of that but show us the the solution Lord show us the remedy help us to come out of here don't leave our soul in Hell Lord this hell has come to the surface and the lid is torn from hell and demon powers are streaming into the Earth hell has come to the surface Lord don't leave our soul in Hell father don't allow your family to be corrupted by this evil age we commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you friend you can be seated praise the Lord so somebody's got to prove it yeah somebody's got to live in such a way that the word of God is verified to a world who does not think that it should be taken so literally now I'm not judging the world I'm just calling it like we all see it amen it's very obvious friends that the world has you know relegated the Bible uh to just you know almost like like a a buffet like aorus board like you can pick and choose like parts of it are good and relevant other parts of it are not necessary not relevant and I always find that the parts that people want to make irrelevant and old and old fulfilled and we don't have to do that anymore are the parts that talk about how we ought to live holy and acceptable unto God and there's where everybody wants a a more modern approach to the gospel well I'm I I there you know there's no such thing as a modern gospel there's an eternal gospel and it transcends time don't cheapen the gospel by calling it modern or oldfashioned to say it's Eternal it's the mind of God and where and whatever age I was going to live in I want to prove that it's true I would like my last breath if that's tonight I want my last breath to say God is true and the devil is a liar sound like you're with me in that you know God deployed his last messenger of the age he had seven stars in his right hand he Meed them out down through 2,000 years across seven Church ages finally it came to the last day and the last star and his right hand was deployed to the Earth he ran his course left us a message went home to his reward and as I said and so say I again tag you're it amen we don't need any of the messengers to come back into this age and prove the word is true we it is up to us to prove that what they told us was the word is true see he was sent as every messenger was to reflect the light of the coming son that's the s o n and the Su n as we would talk when we talk about the suum we're talking about the light of God's word and the light of God's word is the spirit of Christ and so so we find that that is life and that that is light brother Brandon made an amazing statement how that he said that that the word that we have is the spirit the Holy Spirit made word amen think about that statement that's that's amazing I I thought about people who who have a problem when when a when when a prophet explains how that the how that the the the word you know is is now when when we say you walk in the light as he's in the light then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin so we realize that the word of this hour is connected to the blood of Christ because nobody has that physical chemistry of his blood and and he and so in that case we're all finished anyway we might as well you know take our ball and go home be but but we realize that we don't need the chemistry we have the life that was in the blood and that life is made into word and I'm eating it and if I eat the word what do I become and then if I become the word then the blood applies to me see so we're not saying anything that should shock people when we say you have to be a believer and a partaker of the word for your hour if you expect the blood to speak for you that's easy to prove in the Bible and so a messenger came to our day reflecting the light and and you know there there there's such a promise in the word of God for you and I of where we're going to friends I'm here to tell you we're on a journey and we're going somewhere and we're almost home amen we've been uh the bride of Christ has been moving in this direction for 20 centuries and she you say she's at she's at the end time she's at the end of the end time because the end time you know even even in a broad in the broadest sense the whole new testament era is the last days sure because one day with the Lord is a thousand years and even even a prophet talks about that the last two the last 2,000 years you have to understand that the Earth went 4,000 years waiting on a jubilee waiting on a promise that the spirit of God would finally come and live inside of human beings that was always the plan that was always what the Holy Ghost was going to be it was going to be your creator living inside you it wasn't possible he could come on his family he could anoint them but he couldn't remain there because the the Lamb of God had not been offered you know it's the for he he could not remain even on prophets indefinitely and he couldn't re he couldn't remain on people indefinitely for the same reason that the Lord said to Moses Moses I cannot dwell among these people because they're stiff neck they're rebellious and I will just slaughter them if I do cuz I'm holy and I can't I can't countenance that kind of rebellious attitude so I I won't be able to dwell myself in the midst of them but I'll send my angel and he will dwell among you now fear Him listen to his word because that's just God in another office hallelujah it's an office where where God can come down and have mercy for his family see and so for that same reason he couldn't he couldn't dwell permanently within unconverted people that's why John was told when you finally see a human being that the spirit of God comes upon and remains that'll be the Messiah and he'll be a road map he'll be the blueprint he'll be the Prototype I'm going to have a whole Kingdom like him Hallelujah and so this message has come to reflect the light of this coming son when we're going to be restored under such glory and such Dominion that Adam had back in the Garden of Eden and then this was really the burden this was the constant constant um it was a major theme of William bram's Ministry that we're going back to something this is why he took the time to preach many hours on the future home this is why he took hours to preach things that are to be and tell you about the kind of body you're going to have Hallelujah this was why he took hours to preach leadership to show you how to get there oh my friends this is exactly why that he showed Christ as the mystery of God revealed and took hours to do it so that you would understand that you're in the picture you're with Christ you're the third event now we're being restored back to the Garden like Adam had it he's he he spent 2,000 years he spent 2,000 years in in the second stage first was to to fully reveal himself in in Christ and then for 2,000 years to prove that he had preeminence in his body the bride but then the last event comes a Capstone when the when the dead in Christ for hundreds of years will rise and we which are alive and remain shall be changed Hallelujah I believe we're right on that friends such power such Glory such Dominion that we're headed back to brother Brandon when he's preaching things that are to be he's so caught up in the realization of what that means and and what was coming because now the the book was open the book that had been closed sealed up under Seven Seals and and now more there's being more revealed than just brother M I'm starting to understand the separation between salvation from destruction and full Redemption and he's starting to he's now he's understanding that it's more that predestination is more and I'll have to be real careful here because this is where we're going to uh of where we're going to end up Sunday but he's understanding that real predestination yes it's true it is it is as brother brandom constantly described it's just a simple thing he said I know your Baptist don't like that word and boy they don't I said it to a Baptist and he was ready to fight me and I didn't I I thought man I mean am my understanding brother Brandon right so I said it to a Baptist and wow you learned what not to say that's a I mean you're talking about getting triggered why wow and so so I and and I just said well look I'm only I'm only quoting you what it says in the Bible and with his own fist he come down and smashed I think he wanted to smash me but he smashed the Bible and hard and he says you know it don't it don't mean that and I said well I'm not really trying to tell you what it means I'm just telling you what it said I I'm all doing is reading it I don't understand why you need me to tell you what it means it's plain language whom he did for no he did also predestinate how's that hard to get see and and so so we find but brother brandham realize that it's it's more he would try to explain you know how why do you think that's hard to do when an all- knowing omniscient God who's all knowing fills all time space and Eternity how hard would it be for that kind of a being to know the end from the beginning and arrange in the middle he could predestinate by his for knowledge and brother brandham said that for years and years and years until finally he began to realize as the word began to be open and the seals began to break free then he realizes it's actually a little more than that that there is actually a deposit called a gene that God places in his family and his elect or his or his family by origin Hallelujah and that's why Jesus could so confidently say not lose one of them so excuse me for bubling with this mic it's just giving me some trouble tonight it's all right right we'll tighten it up a little bit so so we find out then that you know he's the realization of what it means and the bodies that we're going to have and what is being revealed under Redemption and how that the we're at the stage this is what this is what becoming reality to him my the Jews are in the Homeland it was 3 minutes till midnight and and they're waiting on Messiah and and wow he can see it under the first woe and the second woe and it's all starting to come together and he starts he starts proving by his teaching Through the Bible and all you got to do is go along with him and you see how airtight the case is how that the seals and the trumpets and the vials and the woes and they're all working in a cluster and they're all happening they're all end time events as they winding up and the prophet is realizing that that we're right on the right on the edge of it and and he's revealing and all these things are being revealed and here he is you know and he's living under the effects of this and what it meant to him to realize that he actually wasn't crazy and the world thought he was and even he wondered and asked his wife mey have I lost my mind you know here's a man that filled up you know tens of thousands of people and a and and emptied hospitals and prayer lines for city blocks and here's a man who stood in a prayer line and never left it for for 3 days and slept and ate in the pull pit and and and had meetings where every single person was healed and now here he is and all doors are closing to him and he's just got the Full Gospel businessman and what's going on and all men have forsaken me but I'm here to tell you there was one man who had not forsook him and there's a bride who's not forsaking him there were Eagles saying that's the kind of food we've been looking for see he said you know don't you feel brother Brandon makes this statement you know don't you feel that travail it's beginning to be evening time see and and so you know we now all right there you go I could I could spend the rest of my sermon but I would just be telling you what you already know that the miraculous was UN paralleled yes am the scale of the supernatural was almost Stupify where you've got men great men not not William bram's own testimony great men who are received as great men like men like or Roberts and Tommy osbor and men like that and George Z zaz Cliffe and and you you've got Gordon Lindsay and these are well-respected Scholars who are not following his message but they're all testifying to the accuracy of that gift and the and the and the quality of Christianity that the man lived or Robert said that flatly in his testimony said it is obvious that no I forget how the quote goes exactly but that there was no case considered difficult amen when they came before William brandham all the other guys in the field man we this is a tough one W this is man look at the condition of this person but let's dis but he he just said but when it came before William brandom and that angel of the Lord began to come around and Robert said there was there was no case considered even difficult I was telling my wife here there I was listening and heard a quote of brother brandham where he's standing there in a prayer line and and a man comes up for prayer and he's and brother brandham says sir I'm um I'm sorry I can't I'm not going to pray for you and the man was like what do you mean I've waited in this prayer line are you how arrogant why are you not going to pray for me sir and brother Brandon and his hum Bo sir you know sir um you don't want me to say no I want you to say I demand to know this man's not going to pray for me well sir it's because you're having an affair with your secretary and the Lord is not goingon to even let me pray for you and the man Ducks his head and flies off the platform runs out of the building don't tell me the presence of God wasn't there friends it wasn't playing church that's the last thing it was and too many of them come into that and the prophet would warn them don't come up here if you've got hidden sin in your life I'm not responsible see and so when a when a when a when a small stature man walks out to 20 or 30,000 people and reaches a point and says now I take every spirit in here under my control for the glory of God that was no joke that was serious people died in the presence of God for defying that and so we we find that there was no case too hard because the angel had told him nothing will stand in front of your prayers not even cancer not anything all you have to do is get the people to believe you so you know and so I mean you know now here we are as I said I could go on with that all night I'm just preaching to the choir but now let's let's let's jump forward because here we are and we've been living under the reality of these deep Revelations for 60 years amen let's confront it let's not hide from it let's just take that on here we've been here 60 years and you know we we thought that I I remember growing up as a young man and and as a young minister and you know through the 80s and and through the 90s and I'll just tell you that we we thought universally that Revelation alone would take us all the way and we had tremendous Revelation and things began to break to to some of our senior ministers some of them who aren't even with us anymore and some a few still are and tremendous breathtaking just things that were too too wonderful for us to almost to take in and I've been in meetings you know where a couple thousand people are just swaying just back and forth nobody can believe it and there's pandemonium just at the revelations that are coming forward we thought Revelation would take us all the way but God's plan for his last days was that there would be more for us to overcome than we thought I'm going to say this there would be more for us to overcome than even I believe the messenger thought because he flatly looked forward and everything went so dark after 77 and they asked him why did you pick 77 he said because I thought nobody could survive it would get so dark after 77 it just went totally black that was what the Bible said would happen Darkness would cover the Earth and a gross Darkness would cover the people and now here you are 87 997 2007 2017 and you're moving toward 2027 say how much worse can it get it's 10 times worse than I thought it could be 5 years ago but this was this was God's plan I'm going to tell you why I believe friends is that we had to have the other side of great Revelations that were coming out of the opening of the seals I mean it wasn't just Revelation in the seals it wasn't just that we were understanding who we were it wasn't just understanding who the Antichrist was but but this was the same Angel who had control of the seventh vial he's the very same one that showed John the holy city the bride he's the very same one that John kept trying to worship Him thought he was Christ and he kept having to stop him and he throws a rock up in the air and thus sayith the Lord judgment to striking the west coast and it did and he said now from this point the judgments will just get worse and worse and worse and worse there there be no peace till Jesus comes it doesn't matter what they do put an Abraham Lincoln and a George Washington in every County you won't turn it around the world is going completely insane so now we've got exploding Revelation we've got simultaneous judgments that are being poured out but I'm here to tell you I believe that we had to experience the darker side of these manifestations amen far worse than we even thought possible and I say that as a man approaching my Elder years hard for me to imagine don't know how I got here I was only 25 three weeks ago that you were not well that's how I feel and you know you all heard sister Jean give her testimony here and here she is b84 in December and she was you were giving your testimony sister mom you were like 22 or 22 year old young woman in those meetings uh but here she is still a Believer amen I don't witness to anybody oh my is this okay I'm just pouring the heart out of a man aging here you know I once was young and now I see my my years coming on and I'm here to tell you by experience none of us thought we' be here amen none of us did I can tell you I sat in those message me in those Minister meetings and sat and talked hours and hours to some of our great leaders who are gone on men who I sat at their feet and learned the Bible from and none of us thought there's no way it's impossible and and here we are friends oh my uh but but but I want to I want to say that the things we see although in the world today although they're they've reached unimaginable levels and we and we know that's true I mean even you don't need my perspective for that if if you've been alive here if you were if you're 20 you can remember 10 and the world then to now is way different just in a decade it's been unimaginable the pace of degradation and things that the bride in this age would have to waigh through we've talked about it many times how that this is the only age that ever had to face the double whammy of the days of Noah and the days of lot combined ages dealt with that individually but we deal with it combined and it just so happens as if that's not bad enough where gee let me think how bad is it well every man's mind was evil continually around the entire planet the the spirit of perversion so bad they even wanted to to uh to to defame Angels no fear of anything of God of anything of of Holiness and righteousness that you're talking about a sick world and that's where we live now I know we swim around and it's like the Frog being boiled being slowly boiled to death we just say well it's just life it's not it's not life like God ever intended and now as if those things aren't bad enough Satan has now been voted in as the god of the age and now it's Satan's Eden he's had 6,000 years s him conditioned to its fullness not just in a local city that got nuked later but now globally a whole world as the days of Noah not only not only willing but as the Bible says and dare I say with the scripture they're not only willing to be ungodly but they're eager to be ungodly and they will support and prop up anyone who will be ungodly with them there's nothing you see on the streets today that's not prophesied right here that it would be exactly like that the the part that we never imagined is it would be this bad and we'd still be here see am my no wonder you know the the the perversion has so bad now that the insanity has reached a level it I mean it flies into the very face of nature itself and you know I I was saying to to Green Pond assembly over there I said my they say you know they said during the pandemic you need to believe the science well I okay fine I wish you'd believe the science on gender identity how about you believe the science I I would say follow the science science tells you that's nonsense it's impossible oh but nobody wants to follow the science unless it's convenient to their political ideology Insanity friends the whole world is insane don't chase that thing young people don't chase it it's it's burning it's going to Ash and Cinder and there's a bride getting ready to leave here they create issues in education issues in politics issues in society at large issues for which there are no Solutions no wonder the world has become so polarized both sides shouting neither side listening my the and and the and and the right just as bad as the left yes Hallelujah need everybody need to say Amen to that different beliefs same evil different actions same devil controlling both sides not hating on the world world I'm just declaring there's this is real this is happening in real time and and brother brandham knew that that we could be in this for the long hul but man nobody wanted to think that I can tell you nobody wanted to think that brother brandham talked about that it might not be for another 100 years it might not be for another 50 years it might not be you know I said I don't know when he's coming and he talks about California and and and and I'm and I'm I'm here to tell you something friends I I just seen a quote refreshed to my mind the other day that it's it was not said thus sayith the Lord it absolutely was not and there's not a quote where he said it as thus sayith the Lord but he did offer an opinion that he he thought the bride would see California go he thought we would that would happen before the bride goes home that's on tape I'm here to tell you something friends one of these mornings you might just wake up and there's a news flash and there's something that's happened and nobody body knows what's going on and as the day progresses the nightmare of reality is going to begin to strike we've lost hundreds of miles of our Western Seaboard and millions are dead I I you know there's a lot said and I'm I'm I'm working on it right now I don't have it ready to present but that that's one of the helpful things that has come from artificial intelligence uh generative I should say ai's been in use for 20 years I mean back in the day when you were using word and little clippy guy remember him look like a little paperclip I mean that was AI you know word correct in your grammar we've had that but generative AI where where where it can now you know uh understand context and I always had a question in my mind you remember y'all remember me telling you the story where I had a question about the New Jerusalem and the city and the mountain and how big and I went to a college and talked to a professor there and got the whole breakdown I preached on that and and I've had a I've had had a a question about but I didn't know who there was no one person you could ask you would need you would need a a a whole team of experts you would need Economist and geologist and and and political scientist and and and you'd need you know because I'm trying to answer the question what would be the Fallout politically you know as far as geology is concerned the Earth loss of life Financial social political what would happen if if our if the United States would suddenly in a moment with no time to prepare or evacuate lose a piece of its land mass 1,500 miles long start at San Diego and go north you don't I mean you're finally going to run out of California 350 miles wide back to the salt and sea look on the map do you can do it yourself when there's 20 million people living just in the San Fernando Valley by itself and how would you project the loss of life the tsunamis the the geological impact the the the the Earth you know what would even happen to the gravitational polls what would happen politically financially the the banking industry Silicon Valley the insurance industry our our Western Seaboard military defense who would you ask and I've always thought who could I'd have to I'd have to go to a university and just go down and and talk to every professor and try to coate it all and but now I I and so the other day I've been doing some research using artificial intelligence it it projected it and it's alarming oh yes amen it'll take your breath away and it I can just tell you this the world has no clue they're not prepared for what's coming Hallelujah but I believe I know that a prophet said that the the of Matthew 27 and 28 repeat at the end time and I know in 27 and 28 there was two earthquakes one on Good Friday and that one's already happened and there was already a crucifixion of the word and an indictment of the age and the next earthquake was Resurrection morning hallelujah hallelujah and the the the graves and the bodies which slept a rose Hallelujah and we're seen of many oh could it be friends oh I going tell you something something if you get up and you hear some kind of report just start getting ready to see those loved ones Hallelujah they're going to turn around and there they're going to be and we're going [Music] home that's happening that's happening in your life time hallu in my lifetime we saw how the and and when I look at 60 years then I say then it's fitting because I can see how that the bride has moved up the pyramid in her growth of and maturity from the foundation of faith in the first age all the way up to the Capstone realization and all of those characteristics of the new birth they had to be experienced in Satan's Eden God has going to have to prove this thing he's not going to prove it when we're on the other side he's going to shake it in the devil's face but the proof is being done right here right now that the word has the power to keep a bride pure and clean and renouncing the things of the world voluntarily renouncing them they had to be proven true that we may prove As Romans 2 or 122 says that we may that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God you see the the ministry of Elijah was not merely proven theologically though that's a you can make a really good case and fact is it's so good that's the one no one will will take my Challenge on they want to argue and and attack a dead man's personal life but none of them will come and say as I've challenged around the world and say bring your Bible let's talk about the doctrines I can I can prove What We Believe by the scriptures and and and I can tell you the proof is so Ironclad that it really relegates trying to resist it is just shooting blanks like brother Ernie used to say they're shooting blanks man you got laser guided weapons that don't miss Hallelujah the ministry of Elijah was not just proven theologically it was proven experientially people witnessed it by the tens of thousands you know a a a a man walked in that Ministry and 33 years of ministry around the world seven times and produced the promises that were foretold had been foretold what the Holy Ghost was supposed to be what Hebrews 13:8 meant everybody knew what it said that Jesus Christ would be the same yesterday today and forever and they resisted that they went from either not understanding it to outright denials it didn't matter a Kentucky hillbilly went seven times around the world and proved that was true and Christ was always faithful to him to prove it I'm here to tell you something Friends The Omega bride the final voice to this final age you've got to prove those promises also I mean just like the alpha bride listen the alpha bride had to prove what Ezekiel had said the Holy Ghost would be yeah he said that he he would Pi take you up out of water sprinkle clean water upon you he give you a new spirit and then he'd give you his spirit and it would cause you to keep his Commandments that Alpha church had to prove that was true they said Peter you are a bunch of drunk people said no you misunderstand we're not drunk this is what Joel said they had to prove that you understand they had to prove what Isaiah had said they had to prove what all those prophets had said the Holy Ghost would be when it came in and took a heart of F A Heart of Stone and gave you a heart of Flesh and and God would dwell in the midst of his people and they walked that's why and you've heard me say the book of Acts was written because people acted they heard they recognized and they acted upon the word of God I'm here to tell you there's prophecies concerning this end time bride and you're going to prove it you're going to prove that you're not like that woman that for forsook the world and committed adultery against Christ you're not like Israel when they did that you're not like NAIA when they did that this bride is predestinated to not fall Hallelujah and she's marching to Zion beautiful beautiful Zion Oh My they proved everything the Old Testament said would be when God lived in the heart they proved exactly what Jesus said it would be when he and the father DW dwelt together in his kingdom in his people and the bride has to do the same thing she had to do the same thing in every age she had to everything that John had written about those characteristics in the Book of Revelation that that bride of that day it's it whether they knew it or not because it was sealed away to them they were actually walking in perfect fulfillment of scripture not even knowing that they needed to try yeah amen amen and here you are with the seals taken off of the book and the whole plan and now you not only try it's become your whole entire desire you have risen to a place now where you see who he is and you see who you are and you see what the plan is and you say my goodness yeah it's been 60 years no wonder because there had to be somebody to prove this thing and I'm so glad to be one of those Witnesses I'm so glad that I can give my life in dedication and prove what the word has said see cuz we've arrived at that time we've arrived at the time that the climaxes of all the ages the acts of the Holy Ghost for 2,000 years we've arrived at a time when the former and latter rains now are to be poured out close together in the same month these these are all unprecedented these are all unique to our day see was not that there's only one place you find and that was a fulfillment left for the end time the former latter rain would Pour Out close together in the same month that was a prophecy at the end time along with I'll I'll your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall see see dreams all of these prophecies go together for what the bride would be over 2,000 years and at the end time she'd come to a climax she'd come back to the original and just like the original proved the Old Testament at the end time we're here to prove everything in the New Testament we're here to prove that what Paul said is true I can prove what is that good and acceptable and holy thing of God it's one thing to say I proved it when there's no contrast you live in the most contrasting age between good and evil that's ever existed you're living in Gross Darkness but yet you're still a Believer Hallelujah and I'm not afraid I have courage and I'm ready to stand and I'm ready to go forward Hallelujah a bride marching to the rhythm of the word the world and the modern Church of Leota being led by a witch marching to worldly music and worldly entertainments and all of them headed toward the abyss all of them Prophet said the most awful screams you ever heard was when they just started they were marching and they just started going off the edge and just plunging into the abyss you would think they'd went whoa but when you're blind you don't know that's the abyss you're under a trance you're under a spell it's a spell of Witchcraft it's a it's it's a false prophet that has that brother said what made him a false prophet is that he taught false teaching and so when you when you look at the concepts of how brother Brandon brought it and this is why brother Lonnie used to always show it this way so it's so beautiful I don't have time to preach on it tonight but but but literally how are people going to end up in a tribulation when it's so clear how to avoid it I mean it's in such black and white and it's so plain and and it gives you the road map it's like it's like taking the ultimate test and you've got the cheat codes and he's given the whole world here's how you avoid it here's what you don't do and they all go and do exactly what they're not supposed to do say how in the world can the insanity get and a prophet taught us that that false prophet preaches them right into iten preach you see you see why seeds of discrepancy are so deadly you see why a a human doubt in the slightest bit against God's revealed word and proven and Vindicated word is so dangerous you see why he had to send a Prophet this thing had to be Razor's Edge this thing had to be thus sayeth the Lord and so much so that if even the messenger slipped and made a mistake the Holy Spirit would stop him Mak him back up and fix it Hallelujah oh I'm so glad he had enough humility to do it oh I'm so glad he had enough humility to to admit that he had ups and downs and fers and fals and that's why I admit it and that's why we admit it and that's why we say we're all in this thing together Hallelujah but I but I'm coming now by the mercies of God I'm presenting myself a Living Sacrifice I can't do it you can't do it but by the mercies of God I can do it hallelujah oh my I and here we are Marching and and even the bride got out of step and a prophet said if you wanna if you want to know listen friends if you want to know why sometimes and I'm not a prophet but I'm about to expose you to yourself because you're going to know what I'm about to say don't anybody raise their hand we don't need you to confess I'm not going to confess my faults and failures to you I'm just going to say pray for me because I got them amen amen but but but we realize that that the that the bride kind of got out of step and people wonder why I can't live a more Victorious life because you got out of Step well okay but how did that happen I'm glad you asked a prophet said she though that bride at the end time that one at the very end she got out of Step by watching that other group paying too much attention to worldly uh stuff worldly yeah worldly anything oh my get it out of your life get it out of your home get it away from you turn your whole life look toward the Christ look toward the Holy Spirit and say Lord let me this day Avail myself of your mercies that I might walk through that I might forsake the nonsense of the world and that's why Prophet was screaming he said when I when I came out of the vision I was standing in the middle of the room with my arms out saying get back in line now the now you say that's Dreadful no there's actually a little beautiful thing that he he just dropped in there right before he comes to that that's just the ending but brother Brandon before before that happened moments before that happened he said I noticed that instead of going down like they went down he said instead of going down she started going up that's while she was stumbling that's While She Was Out a step she was still going up Hallelujah the mercies of God are upon us friends and the promise of the word is for you and there's not enough devils in hell to stop that say oh then that gives me Freedom uh to sin it doesn't give me that it gives me a contrite heart it breaks my heart and say Lord God oh let me get back in Step I'm so glad to know I'm going up but I want to earn it I want to know that I that I'm in that I'm in the game I want to know that my life is counting for something hallelujah what about it bethl Tabernacle is that where you are in your heart tonight you don't a lot of times we don't understand and sometimes we have a hard time understanding you know something let me just say it like this you there's no way okay this is here's a good way to say it you'll get it you know as well as me there's no way to to get an understanding of of anything be it a Doctrine be it anything that's a benefit to your to your understanding there's no better teacher than experience there's no way to get yourself psyche around it better than by experience so yeah a prophet came and opened the seals and was wonderful Revelations and for 60 years and we thought that would get us home it never was going to get us home because it wasn't just here that we had to understand it it was here we had to live it Jesus had to live it Paul had to live it the disciples had to live it Luther had to live it the Pentecostal fathers had to live it who wants to live it yes I'd like to have been gone 60 years ago but when I get there I'll be more valuable I'll know how to rule and reign with Christ A Thousand Years see we didn't want that to be true but if we're going to reign with Christ in the world to come the tutor knew yes he knew we would need experience the work of the spirit you see wasn't really finished when you got born again a lot of people think it is you're just getting started say man the uh the people who come in on the on on the last day well they're going to be awfully lucky yeah tell that to the thief on the cross and see if you get that kind of an answer see when when when we think about the work of the spirit not being finished finished how that he's got to continue to work in our lives you know the the new birth you know he's when you get born again then then the holy spirit is just in the right position to start leading you and guiding you I mean you're you say well he you mean he can't lead me and guide me before I get born again he could but you won't listen Paul said your mind is enmity against God it would never agree with God's word why do you think you're a sinner why do you think you did things that destroyed your life were you crazy were you stupid no were you ignorant no uh you you lived a sinful life that was sending you to an early grave and you did it in in a high gear see so your your mind would was is not geared to think and agree with the word of God that's what the Holy Ghost is given for that you may be not transformed that you that you may be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that that you may prove what is that good what is that Holy what is that acceptable will of God so you need to have the experience listen friends the truth shall make you free but there's no there's no level there's no there's no power so much so in truth as when you experience truth as when you prove it as when the Devil comes and brings something to take you aside and you say I will not do that I I've been given power to loose and power to bind and I bind that devil and I cast down vain imaginations and I put my eyes on Calvary and I'm going forward I'm here to tell you you're growing in faith muscles at that time see it actually it actually makes you free listen it actually makes you free when you if we walk in the light you see it actually footsteps mean possession so Freedom Is In Action hearing recognizing and acting if we walk in the light as he is in the light you get me all right I gotta wind down here last point I want to make for tonight we've been preaching on the East Wind the judgment's coming in the East Wind tonight is part 13 Sunday the Lord willing will be part 14 of the voice in the East Wind Brad I see you shaking your head doubting U let me just say my my plan is 14 will be it amen and the theme has been the same all along how was it Pharaoh didn't hear the voice in the East Wind after seven times in a row you would think he would have got it listen friends not only did he not get it by by the seventh one or the eighth one or the ninth one even the 10th one the Locust were only only near the top I think they were the eighth plague seventh or eighth plague was the yeah the eighth plague was the Locust that came in on the East Wind and you'd think okay well the dingdong surely he'd get it now he didn't and then the ninth one came and well now I know he'll get it he didn't okay well the 10th one's going to take out the first born there's there's no there's no question and and Pharaoh not only not only did he not believe that there would come another plague he actually played a part in deciding what the plague would be by threatening Moses in the way he did Pharaoh decided his own fate that's the insanity of Egypt when Israel went in an exodus and here you are in a Third Exodus Hallelujah and the whole world you say why are they so crazy cuz they've decided to be why are they so Godless cuz they've decided to be why is it Satan's eeden because that's what they want that's brother Adam said that's what you want that's what God gave you now what you going to do with it I'm here to tell you I'm so glad I chose the right way I'm so glad I chose the word of this hour I'm so glad I know like job that my redeemer liveth and it's proven to be so he's coming to judge sin and righteousness in this last age the world is oblivious we scream it we put it on the internet we do everything we can we hold meetings we invite people we tell our neighbors we're Witnesses on the job was driving down the street coming to church and here's a woman perfectly innocent woman probably a very nice person she seemed to have a very nice demeanor as we went by and she's got on you know her jogging outfit and it's like jogging pants and uh and and and a shirt and her headband and she's jogging away and I just thought poor lady does not know what even chance does she has have to know that if a woman puts on a garment that pertains to a man it's an Abomination to God and I thought I felt sorry for her I thought man should I pull over and tell her I don't even know if she'd believe me if I did you know why because all the preachers she's ever had probably told her it wasn't necessary and she may have never even read that in the Bible she may have never even read a Bible and that's not one person that one person is indicative of 99.9% of humanity in the world in spite of all the meetings and all the prophets and all the all the great Ministries and all the Supernatural and here we are uh with sending the gospel around the world and we're on the internet we're in church and we got podcast and we got everything going and the world they they have chosen their path and they're it's steadfast they're happy in it and I feel sorry for him but I have also chosen my path I have also made my choice I have also decided to apply a token I have decided to believe every word of God hallelujah friends so you know when I say I know the judgments are coming but listen listen as I as I go off the air here listen the remember in the scripture you've heard me teach on this before how that how that Paul said we shall all come before the Judgment seat of Christ and give an account of our Deeds whether good or bad now if you don't understand that verse it seems like a direct contradiction to the promise Jesus made that that if you've that if you've passed from Death To Life you'll never come into the Judgment then why does Paul say we shall all Al then you have to you have to realize that the Judgment seat of Christ is his word and so the Judgment seat is right here and so as I've said to you so many times the question is not will I stand before the Judgment seat or or the question is not will I the question is where will I and when will I and I don't want to go there then I'll take here now and the judgments of the East Wind are coming and he's coming to bring righteousness and judge sin and I just say Lord look in my life and Judge Me by your word I say bring on the East Wind let it judge my life let it judge your life I voluntarily stand before his judgment seat and I say bring it on Lord bring on the East Wind I know it's Wrecking the world but it's also perfecting a bride who is who has identified herself as the bride of Christ marching to Zion up the pyramid all the way to the Capstone hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah friends is that the choice you've made if it's not the choice you've made are you willing to make that choice tonight why don't you stand up with me all over the building say I I want that judgment seat I want to stand before it right now I'm not afraid of the East Wind I know it's coming for years and it's only going to get worse but if the Judgment seat of God can do both either or it can either destroy me or it can perfect me amen I'm pretty sure you know which one I'm going to choose I just say Lord let it judge my life let let it judge my motives how many Beth of Tabernacle Lord the door and the doors door and doors there's a door to your heart but then when you get in there there's all kinds of other doors you just want to say Lord go into every door how many go into every door judge everything go into my mind my memory my life my entertainment my friends my occupation everything I'm doing everything I'm pursuing oh Lord I I want the word to judge my life I want to be cleansed I want to be pure I want to be clean oh Grant it to

completeness in this day we love you for this Lord I'm so thrilled father to be at the end of the end time it's a sad time for the world but it's a glorious time for the bride an hour that we've

otherworldly just from another realm lifting Us in in stimulation by Revelation Lord so many times we've been in Services over these years we've had plenty of them right here in at at 2608 Mossy Oaks
