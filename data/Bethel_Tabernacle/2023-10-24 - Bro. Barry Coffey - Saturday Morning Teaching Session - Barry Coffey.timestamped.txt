[1:08] may be
[1:12] seated let's go with number
[1:20] one all right so again we have a limited
[1:22] amount of time and I have my clicker
[1:27] here there we go so uh we're going to uh
[1:33] go pretty rapidly through this uh I've
[1:35] appreciated all the meetings appreciate
[1:37] the hospitality and the invitation to be
[1:39] here I appreciate getting to connect
[1:41] with a lot of you that uh haven't seen
[1:43] some I haven't seen for a while and like
[1:44] I said for most of you I know your
[1:46] parents better than you and uh it's just
[1:49] really nice to be here and uh be able to
[1:52] share in the experience here uh being
[1:54] lost in the mountains and uh so I wanted
[1:57] to talk this morning about a subject
[1:59] that is very practical and something
[2:01] that is um that is uh good for us to
[2:06] know and we want to talk a little bit
[2:08] about this subject of uh how they the
[2:11] disciples came and asked Jesus uh to
[2:14] teach us to pray so let's just jump
[2:16] right in is that all right take your
[2:18] Bible if you don't mind cuz we're going
[2:19] to look in the Book of Luke in the
[2:22] moment if you don't have your Bible uh
[2:24] this is where you're welcome to use your
[2:25] phone if you have a uh an app on your
[2:27] phone you the one time you'll have
[2:29] permission to use your phone in church
[2:31] as long as you don't uh you don't go
[2:33] like this you know and use your phone
[2:35] for something
[2:36] else okay and uh don't don't text your
[2:40] friend so in Luke chapter 8 is where
[2:44] we're going to start this morning now
[2:45] brother brandham said he said one of the
[2:47] greatest there you go one of the
[2:50] greatest things he said that I've found
[2:52] in the Christian life so forgive me I
[2:54] have to look this way and this way at
[2:55] the same time all right so that's what
[2:56] I'm doing the greatest thing I found he
[2:58] said in the Christian Life is letting
[3:00] the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you
[3:02] and his work is marvelous how many of
[3:04] you agree there's no one would lead you
[3:06] to the altar but the spirit of God
[3:09] there's no one would bring you here
[3:11] tonight unless it was the spirit of God
[3:13] and he moves in mysterious ways his
[3:15] wonders to perform so God doesn't always
[3:18] move on the basis of logic he doesn't
[3:20] always move according to our time uh our
[3:23] time frame or our time schedule uh
[3:26] sometimes it's not always logical what
[3:28] God does and the things that he asks you
[3:29] to do like hey if you're going to take
[3:31] down a big city like Jericho walking
[3:33] around it with a trumpet in your hand is
[3:35] probably not the most practical thing to
[3:36] do right but God asks us to do things
[3:39] that are not always logical and always
[3:41] sensible and so when it comes to prayer
[3:44] we have to always remember that uh my
[3:46] ways are not his ways his ways are
[3:49] higher than my ways isn't that right his
[3:52] ways are higher than mine they're better
[3:54] than my ways and so therefore when we
[3:56] come to pray and we come to seek God
[3:59] about something
[4:00] we want to know number one we want to
[4:03] pray for things to happen there are
[4:06] things in your life that you want to
[4:07] change like maybe you need healing or
[4:10] deliverance from something or maybe you
[4:11] want to overcome a problem or a habit or
[4:14] a complex in your life you may want to
[4:16] have joy and don't underestimate Joy
[4:19] because the joy of the Lord is your
[4:20] strength isn't it and and we we
[4:24] sometimes need to pray for wisdom and we
[4:25] need to pray for peace I've never seen a
[4:28] time in my life where more young people
[4:30] are affected by the problem of anxiety
[4:33] and there's a lot of people that are
[4:34] that are struggling with that in one way
[4:36] or another and and I will tell you this
[4:38] that that I believe that healing for any
[4:41] problem you have I believe that God has
[4:42] the answers to every situation we face I
[4:46] believe that God has the answers to
[4:48] every situation that we could face yes
[4:50] he's an all powerful God do you believe
[4:52] that yes and so there are times when we
[4:54] need to pray for things to happen now
[4:57] there are also things that we need to
[4:59] pray for more that should happen so we
[5:02] want to have his leadership and we want
[5:04] to have uh you know answers to questions
[5:06] that we uh that we have about what
[5:09] happens next in our life and if I did a
[5:11] survey here this morning and I've done
[5:13] this in many places in the world if I
[5:15] did a survey and uh said give me your
[5:17] questions I could probably categorize
[5:19] those questions into two uh two
[5:21] categories or I could summarize those
[5:23] questions into two categories and one is
[5:25] about the will of God and what I should
[5:26] be doing now and what how do I know when
[5:29] I'm in the will of God how do I find the
[5:31] will of God and that would be the first
[5:33] category and the second category would
[5:34] be uh how do I know when I found the
[5:36] right one to
[5:38] marry and and most often with young
[5:41] people and you find this all over the
[5:42] world uh there is uh there is a you know
[5:46] uh obviously a need to have an answer to
[5:48] both of those things because you got a
[5:51] lot of life that's laid out ahead of you
[5:53] and so Paul tells us in Romans 12 we
[5:55] should rejoice in Hope and be patient in
[5:58] Tribulation and continue constantly in
[6:01] prayer continuing instant in prayer and
[6:03] that means to persevere not to faint but
[6:06] to be in constant Readiness uh to pray
[6:09] in order to to seek God and to seek his
[6:12] will all right is that all right yeah
[6:14] now um there's two things that uh that
[6:18] were asked for in the scripture uh in
[6:20] relation to this and the first thing
[6:21] that uh David asked in the Old Testament
[6:24] was he said uh Lord teach us to number
[6:26] our days that we may apply our hearts on
[6:28] the wisdom in other words Lord help me
[6:31] to be in the right place at the right
[6:33] time doing the right thing that's what
[6:35] it means when he says number our days I
[6:37] want to be found in the right place the
[6:39] right time doing the right thing and and
[6:42] David said I need you to teach me how to
[6:44] do that and you need to be uh sensitive
[6:46] to that in your life you need to develop
[6:48] a sensitivity to that in your life it's
[6:50] really a good uh good practice and the
[6:52] second thing is found in Luke 11 which
[6:54] we want to focus on this morning and
[6:56] that is when the disciples are looking
[6:58] at Jesus they're looking at the kind of
[7:00] ministry he has and the kind of uh
[7:03] results of that Ministry and the work
[7:05] that he's doing and the supernatural
[7:07] that accompanies him all the time it
[7:09] seems like there's uh nothing there's
[7:12] nothing uh that stops Jesus in their
[7:14] view there's nothing that holds him back
[7:17] he's not intimidated by anything or
[7:19] anybody and and they're looking at him
[7:21] and they say teach us to pray we see you
[7:24] going off in the mountain and praying we
[7:26] hear about how you how you commune with
[7:28] your heavenly father father and you know
[7:30] just in in the teachings and they said
[7:32] teach us to do that teach us to pray and
[7:34] I think it's really great because he
[7:36] gives us the words to say and I love it
[7:38] when Jesus gives us the words to say and
[7:40] I love it when brother random gives us
[7:42] the words to say yeah and and so this is
[7:44] very simple he says and it came to pass
[7:46] that as he was praying in a certain
[7:48] place when he ceased when he ceased his
[7:51] disciples came to him and one of his
[7:54] disciples and said Lord teach us to pray
[7:56] as John also taught his disciple so this
[7:58] is not an unusual thing this was
[8:00] something that uh that that they did and
[8:03] he says uh he said unto them when you
[8:05] pray say this Our Father which art in
[8:08] heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom
[8:09] come thy will be done on Earth as it is
[8:11] in uh in L why don't we say it right thy
[8:15] will be done on
[8:19] Earth thy will be done as in heaven so
[8:22] in Earth and give us this day our daily
[8:23] bread and so forth forgive us our
[8:25] trespasses and as as the prayer goes on
[8:27] you're familiar uh you're familiar with
[8:29] it and so therefore uh it is a it is a
[8:32] good thing for us to pray this way
[8:34] because Jesus taught us to pray this way
[8:36] and so let's take a a little bit of a
[8:38] look at that now here's the problem if
[8:41] you like or here's the challenge is that
[8:43] according to the scripture we really
[8:45] don't know how to pray or what to pray
[8:47] for right right in Romans chapter 8 it
[8:49] says likewise the spirit also help with
[8:51] our infirmities and our infirmities are
[8:54] weaknesses the Holy Spirit helps us with
[8:56] our weaknesses and we know not what we
[8:58] should pray for for as we are I know
[9:01] that there's some of you that are here
[9:02] at camp and well maybe not here but
[9:05] maybe there's someone you know who's
[9:06] praying Lord let that girl notice me let
[9:09] that girl I I believe she's the one I
[9:12] want I want to marry her I'm 16 and
[9:14] she's 15 and we're ready Lord and I
[9:16] believe it's the will of God lord just
[9:18] just allow her to look my way and if she
[9:20] comes to breakfast this morning wearing
[9:21] a skirt and a a shirt and and and uh
[9:25] she's sitting on a table full of girls I
[9:27] know that's the will of God I know
[9:29] and I'm going to claim her well you
[9:34] know good luck with that uh it it may
[9:38] not be the will of God and and there are
[9:40] things that uh we all have prayed for in
[9:42] our lives that we found out later were
[9:43] not the will of God but there was a time
[9:45] in your life and you really wanted it
[9:47] but you know God knows better doesn't he
[9:49] he knows better about us and the Bible
[9:51] tells us here that uh the spirit maketh
[9:53] intercession for us with groanings which
[9:55] cannot be uttered and he that searches
[9:57] the hearts knowth what is the mind of of
[9:59] the spirit because he maketh
[10:00] intercession for the Saints according to
[10:02] the will of God so what's better it's
[10:04] better to pursue the will of God isn't
[10:06] it it's better to know the will of God I
[10:08] I mean when I met my wife I knew I knew
[10:12] I you know I I often would ask people
[10:14] I'd ask my brothers and I'd say hey how
[10:16] did you know how did you know that that
[10:19] your your wife was the one and they they
[10:21] all said I just
[10:22] knew I said that's not an answer how did
[10:26] you know they' say well I I I I just
[10:28] knew
[10:30] and I'd ask different people older
[10:32] people and I'd say how did you know that
[10:33] that was the will of God for you how did
[10:35] you know that she was the one and then
[10:37] most often 99% of the time people say
[10:40] you know what I just
[10:41] knew because that is not something that
[10:43] you want to have somebody else tell you
[10:46] right you want to know yourself and and
[10:48] but that was not good enough for me as a
[10:49] single person and then years after I was
[10:52] married I was at Louisiana camp and some
[10:53] young snickle Fritz came up and asked me
[10:56] said brother Mary how' you know that
[10:58] sister Becca was the one I looked at him
[10:59] I said I just
[11:03] knew cuz it was love at first sight you
[11:05] believe in love at first sight that's a
[11:08] weak yes brother random said when Adam
[11:10] saw Eve it was love at first sight he
[11:13] said when Isaac saw Rebecca it was love
[11:14] at first sight he said when Jesus sees
[11:17] the bride in glory it'll be love at
[11:18] first sight when I saw my wife it was
[11:22] love at first sight let me tell you and
[11:26] uh the rest is history so there are
[11:28] things that we don't often know how to
[11:30] pray for and there are things that uh
[11:33] because we are limited to knowing the
[11:35] future as a matter of fact you don't
[11:36] know any of it uh we are we are rely we
[11:39] have to rely upon God but the next verse
[11:42] in Romans 8 says all things work
[11:44] together for good to them that love God
[11:45] and them are the called according to his
[11:47] purpose so we're going to trust in the
[11:49] Holy Spirit to help us help lead us to
[11:51] the right thing and the right answers
[11:54] and the right uh the perfect will of God
[11:56] for our lives that's what we absolutely
[11:59] should do so then the question is how
[12:01] should we pray and let's let's deal with
[12:03] that let me give you a little bit of
[12:04] info and then we'll give you some
[12:06] examples here in the Supernatural sermon
[12:08] brother Ram said prayer is not a
[12:12] perhaps prayer is a sincere thing prayer
[12:17] is talking to God now it's really
[12:19] interesting in the Hebrew language uh
[12:21] there's two words for the word talk and
[12:23] one of the words is the formal uh
[12:26] speaking of a prophet when a prophet
[12:28] came
[12:29] and said thus sayeth the Lord this day
[12:33] Thou shalt
[12:34] die I mean that's the formal God talking
[12:38] that prophets did we don't talk like
[12:40] that right you don't go into Walmart and
[12:43] say thou shall give
[12:47] me 10 bananas lest thou
[12:54] die we don't we don't talk like that and
[12:58] if you talk to your wife like that
[13:01] well you don't want to talk to your wife
[13:03] like that this is the the word for the
[13:07] the ordinary conversation that you would
[13:10] have with somebody so in in the
[13:13] scripture when it talks talks about
[13:15] prayer in this way there there is a a
[13:18] casual talking that that we would use so
[13:21] in Deuteronomy chapter 8 uh the Bible
[13:23] says that uh you know when you talk to
[13:25] your sons and your daughters and you
[13:27] talk about things in your house and at
[13:30] the gate and and uh you know in in
[13:32] around your table in the book of
[13:34] Deuteronomy it means that we're going to
[13:36] we're going to talk about things as
[13:38] human beings would talk and just in
[13:40] conversation and this is the idea that
[13:42] brother Ram's trying to get us
[13:43] acquainted with that prayer is talking
[13:45] to God prayer is not getting down and
[13:47] shut your eyes and think about your
[13:48] washing and your work and say Lord help
[13:50] me uh John and help Miss Jones and so
[13:52] forth he said that's not prayer that's
[13:54] repeating some words but prayer is to
[13:57] come into a atmosphere say it atmosphere
[14:01] now an atmosphere that changes the whole
[14:03] picture here he says prayer means coming
[14:05] into an atmosphere when you realize
[14:07] you're in the presence of God moving
[14:09] into the deepest of sincerity and first
[14:12] you say a little worship like oh Jehovah
[14:14] how I love you or like Jesus said Our
[14:16] Father which art in heaven Hallowed be
[14:18] thy name thy kingdom come and and
[14:21] brother R says we worship a little bit
[14:23] first and and and say oh oh Lord how I
[14:26] love you and how I appreciate you and
[14:27] how I thank you for salvation and all
[14:29] the rest and after the worship come you
[14:31] come with a sincere heart asking and
[14:33] presenting your petitions before God
[14:35] right and he tells us to do that cast
[14:37] all of our cares upon him because he
[14:39] cares for you right so that's what we
[14:41] should do I will tell you some uh I'll
[14:44] tell you a good way not to create the
[14:46] atmosphere and that is to go to prayer
[14:48] like this you can't do that that's right
[14:51] you can't be plugged in and unplugged at
[14:53] the same time right and and and I
[14:56] believe if we're going to create a right
[14:57] atmosphere we need to make sure that
[14:59] we're in the right place so that uh you
[15:01] know there are no distractions and
[15:02] that's hard today I realize that's hard
[15:05] but that's what that's what brother's
[15:07] telling us about you get into an
[15:08] atmosphere and so here's brother bom
[15:11] again in blind B and forgive me here for
[15:13] reading I'll read quickly I won't read
[15:14] it all but you'll have the PowerPoint he
[15:16] said you know there's something about
[15:17] getting Al loone to yourself and this is
[15:19] great cuz here's here's how brother
[15:21] brandom did it here's how he prayed all
[15:22] right so just for your information he
[15:25] said there's something about getting
[15:26] alone to yourself and many people never
[15:28] pray until they come to church
[15:31] yeah thinks the only place to pray is
[15:34] app church but the Bible said for men to
[15:37] pray say everywhere lifting up holy
[15:41] hands and then when we get by ourselves
[15:44] we usually pray different than what we
[15:46] would if we pray if we're in church let
[15:49] me tell you I'll tell you I I will say
[15:51] that you'll pray differently when the
[15:52] blessings are
[15:53] flowing and uh you know that girl
[15:56] actually took a side glance at you when
[15:58] you left the dining hall and you know I
[16:01] I mean when things are going well and uh
[16:03] you know you're blessed in service and
[16:05] we pray a certain way we thank God and
[16:07] thank God for the lovely day I will
[16:09] guarantee you you'll pray differently
[16:10] when things go sour in your life oh yes
[16:13] when you see that girl and she gets up
[16:14] and walks out with another guy
[16:17] huh you'll pray differently when your
[16:20] health is not so great you'll pray
[16:21] differently when uh you have problems in
[16:23] your church and you'll pray differently
[16:25] when you lose your job right you pray
[16:27] differently when you start in tests and
[16:29] so on and and so brother random says
[16:32] we'll pray differently when we're alone
[16:33] and it's a secret prayer that Jesus
[16:35] spoke about enter into a secret closet
[16:37] and close the door and when you have did
[16:39] so pray to your father who sees in
[16:41] secret and he that sees in secret will
[16:43] reward in public and so he says when
[16:45] we're praying like that there seems to
[16:47] be something that takes all the
[16:48] hypocrisy out of it so you're not trying
[16:51] to put on a show and say fancy words he
[16:53] said it seems like to be getting a
[16:55] better connection with God to get alone
[16:58] I think it's a good thing to have a
[16:59] connection with God don't you and he
[17:01] said we get in a better connection with
[17:03] God when we get alone and there's been
[17:05] many times in my life as perhaps in your
[17:07] life that you just have to get alone
[17:09] once in a while with Jesus and I've
[17:11] taken my car and drove down the road
[17:13] studying and I got off on some country
[17:15] road till it became so I became so
[17:18] filled with his mercies and goodness and
[17:20] he said I just stopped the car and hold
[17:23] a wheel and WEP like a baby many times
[17:26] I've climbed up in the mountains where
[17:28] many and thought I was hunting but he
[17:30] said go up and sit on the rock look like
[17:32] up to the sky and he says my whole
[17:35] innermost being became filled with
[17:37] something oh he said everything in the
[17:38] world seemed to pass away all for those
[17:40] precious hours alone with God the last
[17:43] thing he says and it's there when the
[17:45] greatest Revelation and inspiration
[17:46] comes is when you're alone with God I
[17:49] mean do you get the point he's saying
[17:50] over and over again that being alone
[17:51] with God is a good thing being alone
[17:54] with just you and your phone and God
[17:55] it's a good thing right as you're on
[17:57] Facebook you have 200 billion people who
[17:59] are on there with you and that's a good
[18:01] thing and he said and it's there and
[18:02] being sarcastic is that you were on
[18:04] Facebook is that Facebook live no oh
[18:06] okay all right and it's there you're
[18:09] just saying that right and it's there
[18:11] that when the greatest Revelation and
[18:12] inspiration comes is when we're alone
[18:14] with God and we better take we take more
[18:17] time on that I'm sure if if we take more
[18:20] time on that I'm sure we would live a
[18:23] better life and a more Victorious Life
[18:25] In
[18:27] Christ
[18:29] we would take more he said and take more
[18:33] time on that I'm sure that we would live
[18:34] a better life and more
[18:37] victorious in
[18:39] Christ now just very briefly the Hebrew
[18:42] word for prayer is really interesting
[18:43] because it means to reconcile now listen
[18:46] to this for a moment here when when the
[18:49] when the word prayer is mentioned in the
[18:51] Old Testament it means that you have to
[18:53] take a view you have to take a view of
[18:56] yourself and a you like God sees the
[19:01] problem that's the way they that's the
[19:03] way the word is formed and it it means
[19:06] that you're going to reconcile these two
[19:08] things so in other words let's say that
[19:10] I have a problem uh you know I got a I
[19:13] got a decision to make about uh college
[19:16] or you know I'm graduating from high
[19:18] school and I I got to make a decision
[19:20] now do I go to work do I go to college
[19:21] do I take a trade or whatever else and
[19:24] all of those things are perfectly fine
[19:26] but you got to look at that so what you
[19:27] have to do is reconcile this view as if
[19:30] God was looking at it all right so
[19:32] that's the way they taught it and they
[19:34] said so in other words I look at it one
[19:36] way and I look at options and I don't
[19:37] know what what is best I could do that I
[19:40] could do this I could do something else
[19:42] but when you begin to look at things
[19:43] like God is looking at it it changes
[19:46] your perspective so in other words
[19:48] you're going to say Lord I know you're
[19:50] looking at my life and this crossroad
[19:52] that I'm at and I'm I'm confident that
[19:56] you know my future you know the will of
[19:59] God for me the Bible says you do Romans
[20:01] 8 and I know that you have a path you
[20:03] have a purpose for bringing me on the
[20:04] earth in this hour and you have a will
[20:06] for me and when I when I begin to say
[20:09] things like that and I Look to God you
[20:12] know what my decision in a sense seems
[20:14] trivial or my worry seems trivial I know
[20:17] that God's got my back can you say amen
[20:20] I know that God uh has a will for me and
[20:23] that God's going to fulfill his will so
[20:25] when I reconcile a two my worries really
[20:28] should fade away because his way is
[20:31] higher than my way his way is better
[20:33] than my way his way will bring all the
[20:36] things into my life that God wants to
[20:38] bring in my life so I'm going to rest in
[20:40] the fact that God's looking at this and
[20:42] he knows my future he knows my path he
[20:45] knows everything that's going to take
[20:46] place in my life and so therefore I'm
[20:48] just not going to wor I'm just not going
[20:51] to worry amen and when when we talk
[20:54] about reconciling those two things uh if
[20:56] you hang on to it and you look at out
[20:58] only through your lens very often you'll
[21:01] get worried about things and you'll get
[21:03] despondent about things and you'll get
[21:04] troubled about things but when we look
[21:06] at it like God looks at it let me tell
[21:08] you we know that he knows the end from
[21:10] the beginning he knows the beginning of
[21:12] your life and the end of your life and
[21:13] he knows how to get you there because I
[21:16] said as I said in the first quote the
[21:17] greatest thing is to be led by God isn't
[21:20] that right and he wants to do that he
[21:22] wants to do that in your
[21:23] life so there's something about living
[21:26] in this atmosphere of Prayer praying
[21:28] constantly and just being submissive to
[21:30] the will of God there's something really
[21:32] neat about it and when did the disciples
[21:34] you remember the story in Matthew chap
[21:36] 17 and they came to Jesus and uh apart
[21:41] and the apart means that they had just
[21:44] left the scene where there was an
[21:46] epileptic boy that uh you know often cut
[21:50] himself you remember the story and he
[21:52] threw himself in the fire and he took
[21:54] fits and I mean it was pretty bad it was
[21:57] bad enough that this father was
[21:58] desperate and he called his disciples uh
[22:01] Jesus disciples and said can you cast
[22:03] out this devil from him and they tried
[22:05] and they couldn't and they did
[22:07] everything they could but they couldn't
[22:09] and so then Jesus comes along and one of
[22:12] the lowest exhibitions of faith in the
[22:14] Bible was when that father said to him
[22:17] if thou
[22:19] C if you can could you pray for my boy
[22:24] and to me that that that is a man who is
[22:27] a desperate because uh you know he's at
[22:29] a point where he's he's practically got
[22:32] nothing left in reserve he's got no
[22:34] faith at all hardly not that he's a bad
[22:36] man but I mean he's desperate and he's
[22:37] watching the Disciples of Jesus pray and
[22:40] they can't cast this demon out and so
[22:42] Jesus speaks to that demon and it goes
[22:43] and so forth and then they go apart and
[22:46] when they go apart the disciples ask
[22:48] Jesus and they said why couldn't we cast
[22:50] them
[22:51] out how come we could pray all of us and
[22:56] nothing happened and then you come along
[22:57] and and pray and the boy is completely
[23:00] healed and Jesus said to them because of
[23:02] your unbelief for verily I say unto you
[23:05] if you have faith as a grain of mustard
[23:06] seed he said You shall say to this
[23:08] mountain remove Hands To Yonder place
[23:10] and it shall remove and nothing shall be
[23:12] impossible to you great answer and then
[23:14] he says how Beth this kind goeth not out
[23:17] by prayer and fasting and it's
[23:20] interesting because Jesus didn't either
[23:23] he didn't fast right and he didn't go
[23:27] off and pray uh separately but he just
[23:29] spoke to that demon that was there and
[23:31] he left that boy you know why I believe
[23:34] because he lived in a communion with God
[23:36] he lived in a place where he knew
[23:38] exactly where he stood and so he didn't
[23:41] need to go and prepare himself and
[23:43] that's why it's a good thing for us to
[23:44] pray continually because we never know
[23:47] we never know when we're going to be
[23:48] called upon to pray and and if you only
[23:51] pray in church you're going to depend on
[23:53] the atmosphere of church in order for
[23:55] you to uh pray easily but there's a lot
[23:57] a lot of times when crisis will arise
[24:00] and you're not in church and you need to
[24:01] pray because something's happening and
[24:03] something's going on right and that's
[24:05] why it's a good thing to live in this in
[24:07] this place it's a good thing to live uh
[24:09] in that in that uh in that in the spirit
[24:12] of God now let me uh let me just say
[24:15] this uh this is a I'm going to skip just
[24:19] a little bit here and in the Book of
[24:22] John John be
[24:24] record saying I saw the SP spirit of
[24:28] God I saw the spirit of God can I have
[24:31] that na right
[24:33] there this what he said I saw the spirit
[24:37] of God descending from heaven like a
[24:38] dove and had aod upon him and I knew him
[24:41] not but he that sent me to baptize with
[24:43] water the same said unto me upon whom
[24:46] Thou shalt see the spirit descending and
[24:49] remaining on him listen to me he said he
[24:53] whom the spirit descends and remains on
[24:56] him the same as he which baptized him
[24:58] with the Holy Ghost and I saw him bear
[25:00] record that this is the Son of
[25:02] God so Jesus now when he shows up at the
[25:06] river John sees the spirit descend on
[25:09] him and remain now you can be in a
[25:12] meeting like we're in and the spirit of
[25:14] God can descend isn't that right sure
[25:17] but you know what that's not the
[25:19] greatest challenge because if you didn't
[25:21] experience some touch of the Holy Spirit
[25:23] last night you're dead right but the
[25:26] remaining part is a
[25:28] challenge so therefore every step you
[25:32] take has to be with the spirit in mind
[25:36] because the spirit is easily grieved
[25:38] isn't that right so let's say it this
[25:40] way let's say this is the holy spirit
[25:42] because it's white and it's like a dove
[25:45] like that let's say that when Jesus
[25:47] walked and he had the spirit that
[25:48] descended on him it's one thing to have
[25:51] the spirit to sin but it's another thing
[25:52] for have it for him having it to remain
[25:56] with him right so every step he took he
[25:58] took with the spirit in mind I want to
[26:00] make sure that I do nothing in my in my
[26:03] days that Grieves the holy spirit so
[26:05] everything I do every way I talk
[26:07] everything I say to my wife everything
[26:09] that I do I want to make sure that he's
[26:10] there at the beginning of the day I want
[26:12] to be sure he's there at the end of the
[26:13] day I want to be sure he's there and if
[26:15] I make a mistake and the spirit FES off
[26:17] because he's easily grieved I'm going to
[26:19] try to make that right because I don't
[26:20] want to go too far today without the
[26:22] spirit of God very close to me isn't
[26:25] that right and so therefore I believe
[26:28] it's a good practice for us to say every
[26:30] step I take I want to keep the spirit in
[26:32] mind yeah I may actually offend I may
[26:34] offend other people or other people may
[26:36] not understand but you know what I I'm
[26:38] my first priority is to make sure I
[26:40] don't offend the holy spirit is that all
[26:41] right and that's what that's what Jesus
[26:44] had and that's the way that Jesus lived
[26:46] and that's the way that Jesus
[26:48] walked
[26:50] now brother R also says in in Christ's
[26:54] mystery God revealed he said I was
[26:55] riding with a man he said one one time
[26:58] and man said to me think of it he said
[27:00] we are here this on this earth and the
[27:02] way we are he says we can only know or
[27:04] say uh that were saved by some Jewish
[27:06] Fable called The Bible and I said sir I
[27:09] don't believe it's a Jewish Fable and he
[27:10] said well when you pray what do you pray
[27:13] to and I asked for a certain certain
[27:15] thing and I didn't get it so brother BR
[27:17] what do you pray to and I said you pray
[27:19] wrong we should never pray to change
[27:22] God's mind we should pray to change our
[27:24] mind because God's mind doesn't need
[27:27] change that's right how many would agree
[27:29] amen God's mind doesn't need changing
[27:32] and so therefore I look at prayer as an
[27:35] exchange an exchange means that Jesus
[27:38] told us come unto me all ye that are
[27:40] heavy
[27:41] laden that labor and are heavy laden and
[27:44] I will give you rest and take my yoke
[27:46] upon you and learn of me for I am meek
[27:49] and lowly in heart and you shall find
[27:50] rest to your souls for my yoke is easy
[27:53] that word means manageable many times
[27:56] when we go to God it's because of a
[27:58] crisis in our life and we can't manage
[28:00] it I mean if you could fix it you would
[28:02] right if you could uh work it out you
[28:04] would but there are times in life when
[28:06] things come your way that are really
[28:09] unmanageable and Jesus said hey tell you
[28:12] what you do you take my Yol because it's
[28:15] manageable and you take my burden
[28:17] because that burden is light and in the
[28:20] Greek that means agile that's where we
[28:22] get our word agile when you are burdened
[28:25] with something you know you're really
[28:26] troubled by something uh it sometimes
[28:28] you feel like every step is a is is a
[28:31] struggle and uh you know you don't have
[28:32] any Joy you don't have any peace and
[28:35] you're not very Nimble and people can
[28:36] even look at you and say hey there's
[28:38] something I noticed there's something
[28:39] wrong with you and you're not moving
[28:40] like you should Jesus said I'll tell you
[28:43] what to do you give me my burden I'll
[28:45] give you my yoke and he said my yoke is
[28:48] manageable and it'll keep you agile in
[28:51] other words you have a an awareness you
[28:53] have a peace that you know what God's
[28:55] got it he's got it he's got it under
[28:57] control I just GED the Holy Spirit he's
[29:00] got it under control he's got everything
[29:02] uh in his place it's going to be all
[29:04] right and that's what prayer is in it's
[29:07] an exchange it is an
[29:11] exchange so that God takes it and your
[29:14] man you're your agile now let me give
[29:17] you a little example we find over here
[29:19] in the book of Acts you know the story
[29:20] Peter's in prison he's in prison for
[29:23] doing nothing wrong but he's in prison
[29:25] he's laying down on the ground between
[29:26] two guards he's chained to those guards
[29:29] right everybody know the story he's
[29:31] chained to those two guards and he's
[29:32] laying there on the floor in the Middle
[29:34] East prisons are pretty Dirty Rotten
[29:36] Dark Places and filled with water and
[29:38] lots of other things and Peter is laying
[29:40] there on the ground there's two
[29:42] prisoners two guards that are chained to
[29:44] him there's two also standing in the
[29:46] room there's an iron gate and then
[29:47] there's all kinds of guards outside and
[29:49] then there's a big Iron Gate that goes
[29:51] out through the street that's the way
[29:52] I've been in some prisons as a visitor
[29:55] in the Middle East and I've seen
[29:58] so Peter figures wow my days are
[30:00] numbered you know uh my goodness this is
[30:02] the end of the road for me and the Bible
[30:04] says there that as he was sleeping
[30:06] between the two CH soldiers and he was
[30:08] bound with chains an angel shows up and
[30:11] smites him on the side and says stand
[30:13] up and Peter says yeah right he said no
[30:17] stand up on your feet and he stands up
[30:20] and he can't and he's looking down at
[30:23] these guards and they're still asleep
[30:25] and he's looking at this and he says the
[30:27] angel says as the chains fell off his
[30:29] hand the angel said g thyself bind thy
[30:32] sandals on and so he did and he said
[30:34] cast thy garment about thee and follow
[30:36] me so Peter's kind of walking out and he
[30:39] stands in front of the door and the door
[30:40] swings open doesn't touch it the door
[30:43] swings open brother brandom said one
[30:45] time years ago that he and his wife were
[30:47] walking into a supermarket in
[30:48] Jeffersonville and he said he stood in
[30:50] front of the door and swung open and
[30:53] when he saw that you know how they do it
[30:54] in supermarkets right in stores and so
[30:56] forth today and there's a an eye that's
[30:57] watching you there and brother manam
[30:59] looked at that and he just turned to his
[31:01] wife wife right away and he said the
[31:03] Bible had that
[31:05] first and and he Peter's standing there
[31:08] and he stands in front of the door
[31:10] you're the door okay and he stands in
[31:11] front of the door and the door swings
[31:13] open he it
[31:15] whoa and he and he walks out and he goes
[31:18] out this Angel is accompanying him and
[31:20] he walks out goes past all the guards
[31:21] nobody sees him and then he he comes to
[31:24] the Big Iron Gate and he stands in front
[31:26] of the door and it opens up whoa I mean
[31:30] he's enjoying this and he walks out and
[31:31] and he's on the street oh he's you know
[31:34] now he's happy and he's he's you know
[31:36] he's this hey this is all right this is
[31:38] all right and so at the same time there
[31:41] are people praying for him down at John
[31:43] Mark's house right you know the story
[31:45] and Peter says well hey I know where
[31:47] everybody is everybody's at the prayer
[31:48] meeting tonight and so therefore I'll go
[31:50] down there and he stands in front of the
[31:55] door yeah
[31:58] yeah hello
[32:00] hello he stands in front of the door and
[32:02] nothing happen right let me do it again
[32:06] and Peter comes up to the
[32:09] door nothing
[32:12] happened so he decides to knock on the
[32:15] door and when he does the lady there the
[32:18] girl opens up the window shade because
[32:21] everybody's afraid at that period of
[32:22] time she opens up the shade and
[32:25] says it's and he says it's Peter he
[32:29] died that's his Spirit out there they
[32:31] said Hey listen open the door what do
[32:33] you got to lose that's a spirit don't
[32:35] worry and so they open up the door and
[32:36] he Mars Peter what does that tell us
[32:40] that tells me this that there are times
[32:42] in life when you're going to come to
[32:44] doors that are absolutely locked in
[32:46] front of you and you will not be able to
[32:48] open them and when you come to those
[32:50] kinds of doors God will supernaturally
[32:53] open those doors for you but there's
[32:55] going to be other doors that you come to
[32:57] that you can open yourself and God puts
[33:00] Tools in our hands and we should use
[33:02] them right there are situations that are
[33:05] impossible and when you get to that
[33:06] place God will actually open that door
[33:08] make access for you but there are times
[33:10] in life when there's things you can do
[33:12] and you can change and you can ask
[33:14] forgiveness and you can pray and you can
[33:16] make things right and there are things
[33:18] that you can do to open doors in your
[33:20] life and that's exactly what the Holy
[33:22] Spirit wants you to do because God has
[33:23] put those tools into our lives yes sir
[33:27] right let's go back to our text for a
[33:29] moment here Jesus said I got to watch my
[33:32] time here Jesus said thy kingdom come
[33:35] thy will be done on Earth as it is in
[33:36] heaven so just think about this now the
[33:38] way he told us to pray thy kingdom come
[33:41] thy will be done on Earth as it is in
[33:45] heaven right so Jesus said listen there
[33:48] should be a match between what happens
[33:51] here and what happens there that's right
[33:54] do you understand yes Lord and this is
[33:57] the way he taught us to pray he said thy
[33:59] will be done thy kingdom come thy will
[34:02] be done on Earth as it is in heaven so
[34:06] we should pray in this way to say Lord
[34:08] let my life match what happens in the
[34:11] Kingdom because what happens in the
[34:13] kingdom is better than what happens here
[34:15] yeah there are laws that work up there
[34:17] that are better laws than laws here
[34:19] right that's right let me tell you there
[34:21] are things that happen in that Kingdom
[34:23] uh that are more powerful than what
[34:25] happens here I believe when Jesus walked
[34:27] on the water he was operating by a law
[34:29] of that Kingdom not of this one right if
[34:31] you're going to operate by the laws of
[34:33] this Kingdom and you walk on the water
[34:34] you're going to have a different outcome
[34:35] than what Jesus had but when he was
[34:38] walking on the water he was walking
[34:40] according to the laws of that Kingdom
[34:41] there right now think about this when
[34:45] when a Son of God when a Son of God
[34:47] prays and they actually are living
[34:50] according to the laws of that Kingdom
[34:52] what happens in their life is different
[34:55] than what would happen here
[34:57] okay so for instance remember on the
[35:00] story of the Mount of uh when when Jesus
[35:03] was teaching the people and uh there was
[35:05] 5,000 of them there and Jesus said all
[35:07] right Hey listen let's take a break
[35:09] let's have lunch and they said hey we
[35:11] didn't bring anything to feed these
[35:12] people besides there's 5,000 people here
[35:16] and Jesus said you didn't bring anything
[35:17] and he said no uh the disciples said no
[35:20] we didn't bring anything at all matter
[35:21] of fact there's no food out here I've
[35:22] been out there where that is and there's
[35:24] no stores there's no hey there's not
[35:26] even a Walmart out there if you can
[35:27] believe it there's not even a Walmart
[35:29] and so Jesus is say looking at the
[35:31] disciple now he knows what's going to
[35:33] take place but he's looking at them he
[35:34] said you brought nothing and they said
[35:36] no we brought nothing and they said the
[35:38] only thing we have is a little boy over
[35:40] here has his lunch and he's got two
[35:41] loaves of bread and five fishes or two
[35:43] fishes and a couple loaves of bread and
[35:45] uh that's all we've got and Jesus said
[35:47] hey all right tell you what make the
[35:49] people sit down and bring that boy over
[35:51] here and let me take his lunch when the
[35:54] food passed into his hands and he gave
[35:56] thanks thanks for it it passed because
[35:58] it was in the hands of the Son of God it
[36:01] passed now under the rules of that
[36:04] Kingdom and something happened because
[36:07] in that Kingdom there's no starvation
[36:09] there's no hunger in that Kingdom
[36:11] there's no thirst isn't that right in
[36:13] that Kingdom there's no death in that
[36:14] Kingdom there's no sickness in that
[36:16] Kingdom there's no sorrow right and
[36:18] Jesus said thy will be done on Earth as
[36:20] it is in heaven so when he took that
[36:22] bread in his hands all of a sudden it
[36:24] multiplied because it's not under the
[36:26] rule of this world it's under the rules
[36:28] of that world and something Supernatural
[36:31] happen in the same way that when Samson
[36:34] took the Jawbone of a of a mule let me
[36:37] tell you that's not the kind of tool
[36:39] that you would use in a war but when he
[36:41] took it in his hand as a Son of God
[36:43] under the commission of God something
[36:45] happened to that bone and now it was
[36:47] operating according to those rules over
[36:49] there and not these rules here and he
[36:52] won the victory because because thy will
[36:55] be done on Earth as is in heaven in
[36:58] heaven there's no defeat in heaven
[36:59] there's no loss in heaven there's no
[37:02] surrender and when you take something in
[37:05] prayer and you take something in your
[37:07] hand because you are a son of God and
[37:10] you're praying and say Lord thy will be
[37:12] done on Earth as it is in heaven let me
[37:14] tell you things happen why do you think
[37:16] brother brandom had so much success in
[37:18] prayer and talking with people because
[37:20] in that Kingdom there's no sickness
[37:22] right and he's walking in that realm
[37:24] he's walking in that atmosphere with God
[37:26] and let me tell you Supernatural things
[37:28] happen uh when you uh when you walk in
[37:31] that place with God
[37:35] Amen true Walking with God is a powerful
[37:38] thing yes sir Walking with God is a
[37:42] beautiful
[37:43] thing Walking with God will convict you
[37:45] and change your attitude about things
[37:47] that happen in your life I wish we had a
[37:50] little bit more time to talk about this
[37:52] particular subject here
[37:54] but Paul writes to and says sorry I'm
[37:57] flipping here in 1 Thessalonians chap 4
[38:00] he says furthermore he says we beseech
[38:03] you Brethren and exort You by the Lord
[38:05] Jesus that as you have received of us
[38:07] how you ought to walk and to please God
[38:10] so you would abound more and more for
[38:12] you know what Commandments we gave you
[38:14] by the Lord Jesus and this is the will
[38:16] of God even your sanctification Hey
[38:18] listen up this is the will of God this
[38:20] is what Paul is telling us is the will
[38:21] of God for us he said this is the will
[38:24] of God even your sanctification that you
[38:26] should abstain from
[38:28] fornication right that's right that's a
[38:31] pretty weak amen we should abstain from
[38:34] fornication amen fornication is sexual
[38:37] sin between people who are not married
[38:39] right let me let me give you a little
[38:40] piece of advice God hates sexual sin yes
[38:44] God destroyed Sodom because of sexual
[38:46] sin and other instances in scripture we
[38:48] understand that like I said yesterday
[38:50] that uh intimacy uh shouldn't be in our
[38:52] vocabulary or in our sight until we make
[38:56] a Comm commitment with somebody and God
[38:58] looks at that very carefully and that
[39:00] every one of you every one of you should
[39:02] know how to possess his vessel in
[39:05] sanctification and in honor not in the
[39:07] lust of dirty mindedness yeah that's
[39:10] what concubines is we don't use that
[39:12] word in our English language but it
[39:14] means dirty- mindedness and he says we
[39:16] should not walk it's not the will of God
[39:18] for you to walk continually remembering
[39:20] what you saw on a website but rather we
[39:23] should know how to possess our vessel
[39:24] and not walk in the lust of
[39:26] even as the Gentiles which know not God
[39:29] right yeah we are different yes come on
[39:32] folks we are different we should act
[39:34] different we should dress different I
[39:36] believe that when we come here as guys
[39:38] we should not have to struggle with how
[39:39] girls are dressed in a place like this
[39:43] because you all profess the message you
[39:45] all profess to be Christians yeah and we
[39:47] should not have to struggle or turn our
[39:49] eyes because somebody the way somebody
[39:51] is dressed here on is that all right
[39:55] that no man go beyond on and defraud his
[39:57] brother in any manner because that the
[39:58] Lord is the Avenger of all such as we
[40:00] have forewarned you and testified for
[40:02] God has not called us to uncleanness but
[40:04] he's called us to social
[40:08] media no God's called us to Holiness yes
[40:11] and Holiness in his raw definition means
[40:14] separation so therefore how they do it
[40:17] in the world is not your cue we're not
[40:18] learning from the cosmos how to live how
[40:20] to dress how to listen to music and how
[40:22] to how to do things we are learning from
[40:25] those that have taught us we're learning
[40:26] from the word of God we're learning by
[40:28] revelation we are learning in every way
[40:30] that God's made accessible to us how to
[40:31] live in a way that pleases God you know
[40:33] why because I want to make sure I want
[40:35] to make sure I don't grieve the Holy
[40:37] Spirit that's right every step I take I
[40:39] want to keep him in mind yeah so you
[40:41] girls ought to look at that and say if I
[40:43] wear this is this going to be here if I
[40:45] don't wear this is this going to say and
[40:46] that's the kind of question that you
[40:47] should be looking at yeah you say well
[40:50] it won't make me popular but it'll keep
[40:51] you in the will of God and that's what's
[40:53] most important and so so it it's it's
[40:56] it's really vital it's really critical
[40:58] uh for us to uh be mindful of this fact
[41:00] that uh God has given us things so that
[41:02] we would know and it's important for you
[41:04] to apply because like I said yesterday a
[41:06] token is useless unless it's
[41:08] apply if you had a bucket of Blood by
[41:10] the door and you were living in the
[41:11] first Exodus it would absolutely do you
[41:13] no good unless you took it and applied
[41:15] it on the door post of your house you
[41:17] can know about it like brother Andrew
[41:18] said you can know about it you can be
[41:20] sympathetic towards it but let me tell
[41:22] you the token will do you no good until
[41:24] you apply it and where you apply it is
[41:26] everywhere in your life including your
[41:28] phone including your wardrobe including
[41:29] your uh you know your car when you're
[41:31] alone everything else you need to apply
[41:33] that token and that's how you need to
[41:34] live yes sir because the message is not
[41:37] just a bunch of instructions that God
[41:38] has given to us uh hoping that we would
[41:41] make it that's not why God gave us this
[41:43] message so that uh like here's all the
[41:45] sermons and if you read those and you
[41:47] read your Bible you know what uh good
[41:50] luck see you in the
[41:52] Millennium that's not what he said I
[41:55] don't find anyone where where brother BR
[41:57] said that I don't also find anywhere
[41:59] where brother BR said just stay home and
[42:00] play Tes amen I mean if he said that I'd
[42:03] preach that but he didn't say
[42:05] it you got to talk to God you got to
[42:07] live for God you have to make sure that
[42:11] you're in tune with God and remember no
[42:13] matter what happens around you there is
[42:15] only one evidence there is one true
[42:16] evidence of having the baptism of the
[42:18] Holy Spirit and that is believing the
[42:20] word for your days isn't that right A
[42:22] lot of people will do lots of things our
[42:23] world around us will change uh things
[42:26] get darker narrower as the Bible says
[42:28] and so forth but let me tell you there's
[42:30] an evidence that you need to rely on not
[42:32] your feelings and not what everybody
[42:34] else in your cabin does now what other
[42:36] churches do you need to make sure that
[42:38] you believe the word for your hour
[42:39] that's right and you should say Lord
[42:41] make that real make that firm to me make
[42:42] that clear so nothing moves me no matter
[42:45] what takes place in our world because
[42:47] God did not say I'm just going to give
[42:49] you this message do with it what you
[42:51] want good luck I'll see you in the
[42:52] Millennium happy happy tribulation for
[42:54] the rest of the world God didn't say
[42:56] that
[42:56] no so I need to
[42:59] volunteer I need to volunteer and I
[43:02] don't want you to put your hand up I
[43:03] need you to come down here he knows who
[43:05] he is I don't need
[43:08] you hey I appreciate you volunteer but I
[43:11] already had this volunteer lineup thanks
[43:12] buddy appreciate it come on down here
[43:14] brother the cine now we're going to I I
[43:17] I just want to close and illustrate with
[43:18] this because I I I'm just R out of time
[43:20] it' be nice uh to to end this way grab a
[43:23] seat now Jesus said uh this to me now
[43:28] the part of the real reason why God sent
[43:30] the message is to have uh to make sure
[43:32] that we get there to his house and Jesus
[43:33] said I'm gone he said I'm going to go to
[43:36] my father's house and prepare a house
[43:37] for you so that where I am there you may
[43:40] be also so the goal is that he's he
[43:42] needs to come to my house if I'm Jesus
[43:44] he needs to come to my house right
[43:47] that's the goal CU we don't want to
[43:48] leave him here because leaving him here
[43:50] means is's going to be smack in the
[43:51] middle of tribulation tribulation is not
[43:54] a place of you or anyone else would want
[43:55] to be
[43:56] so he's got to get the mil house that's
[43:58] a challenge do you know the way do you
[43:59] know the way to your heavenly home I
[44:03] mean can you give me
[44:04] direction no when you die you go left
[44:07] right north south you don't know right
[44:10] and all of us we don't know so we're
[44:11] trusting that the God in us will bring
[44:13] us to where we need to be but let me
[44:15] illustrate it this
[44:18] way there's two ways for him to get to
[44:21] my house now I'm Not Jesus now I'm me so
[44:24] if I if I if I I wanted brother Kathy
[44:27] here to come what's your first name uh
[44:29] Elijah Elijah Elijah or not Elijah
[44:32] Elijah Elijah what a j
[44:36] Wonder good name what I don't have to
[44:38] double portion you don't have to double
[44:40] portion you're just a single dude okay
[44:42] he's a single
[44:43] dude just
[44:46] say to your pH
[44:49] number only joking all right so brother
[44:52] Eli j is here and I want him to come to
[44:55] my house two ways for me to get into my
[44:57] house all right one of them is I can
[44:59] tell him how to get there and I can give
[45:01] him instructions about how to get to my
[45:03] house all right you ready you need to
[45:04] listen to this all right cuz it's going
[45:06] to get you to my
[45:07] house now you need to leave leave out of
[45:10] here okay and you go down to the main
[45:13] road whatever that is and then you take
[45:16] a right and when you take the right
[45:19] you're going to be hooking up with I
[45:21] think it's 278 and 278 will wind you
[45:24] around and you come to Carol and you
[45:26] come to another little town before Bard
[45:29] and that turns into 60 and then that
[45:31] turns into 44 okay there just little
[45:34] side roads there hey don't laugh
[45:35] remember this and so when you when you
[45:39] get there and you come to Bard and
[45:40] you're going to work your way towards
[45:41] Ashville okay so there's another Ro I
[45:44] think it's 276 and you're going to take
[45:46] 276 it winds around but it'll actually
[45:48] bring it to the outside outskirts of
[45:49] Asheville and so you want to watch for
[45:51] that to get on 40 for a short period of
[45:53] time only short and then you're going to
[45:55] make a left
[45:56] actually the the exit R goes right and
[45:58] then you're going to go to 26 and 26
[46:00] will take you over the mountain through
[46:01] Johnson City all right so when you get
[46:04] into Johnson City go Pastor don't stop
[46:06] and you go P there and you go to 40 and
[46:08] when he gets on 40 he'll sorry sorry 81
[46:11] you get on Interstate 81 go right across
[46:13] there and that'll bring you right to
[46:14] withv right into Virginia past Bristol
[46:17] and Abington and so forth get all the
[46:19] way to wivi don't stop at withi okay but
[46:21] you going even though sister Becky was
[46:23] born right there don't stop there okay
[46:25] keep going and and then you go all the
[46:26] about 45 minutes more and then you come
[46:28] to exod 114 when you get to exod 114
[46:31] there a great big hospital there and to
[46:33] be a sign there and you're going to take
[46:34] Pig Path Road say it after me pig Path
[46:37] Road and then you get on that road you
[46:38] so you're going to right off the
[46:39] interstate you're going to go left on
[46:41] Pig path and it's going to wind you down
[46:42] through the countryside farms and smelly
[46:45] as they raise Hogs there and then you
[46:46] come down on the route eight okay when
[46:48] you go to Route eight and you're going
[46:49] to go to the Post Office watch for the
[46:51] post office in Riner there's a big flag
[46:53] there it's always half mask cuz the
[46:54] guy's ex marine green and so you always
[46:56] got a p flag on there so watch that's
[46:59] white and so then when you come to the
[47:01] post office turn left on Union Valley
[47:03] you go a half mile on Union Valley and
[47:05] you come to surface surface you turn the
[47:07] left and you go to the end of the road
[47:08] to Tac and that house is
[47:11] mine got it let me ask you a question
[47:15] how many of you think that he's going to
[47:16] make it with those
[47:18] instructions come on let's be honest no
[47:21] does anyone here believe that he's going
[47:23] to now that is the way to my house you
[47:24] ask my wife she doesn't tell lies you
[47:26] doesn't stretch anything like me and
[47:29] so that is literally the way to my house
[47:33] but I don't think he's going to get
[47:34] there with those
[47:35] instructions neither did God give us
[47:38] this message as a bunch of instructions
[47:39] saying figure it out get there on your
[47:41] own good luck see in the in the marriage
[47:44] supper he didn't do it that way you know
[47:46] what he did he said I'll be with you
[47:49] that's right even in you to the end of
[47:52] the world isn't that right that's right
[47:54] so the second way to get to my house
[47:57] brother Elijah is to do this I'll go
[48:01] with you yeah there you go now you drive
[48:05] okay and I'll tell you where to go and
[48:07] when you're when you're heading down the
[48:08] road and I'll tell you what turns it
[48:10] take okay because I know the way to my
[48:12] own house yeah I know where I live so I
[48:15] don't need to explain a bunch of stuff
[48:16] to you you just follow the directions
[48:18] okay follow where I'm going and when you
[48:20] when you need to turn right and turn
[48:21] right when you turn left and turn left
[48:23] and you know what if you make a mistake
[48:24] I'll correct you because after all I
[48:26] know the way to my own
[48:28] house are you following me he didn't
[48:31] give us a message and send us on our
[48:32] road he said I'll be with you and and
[48:35] even in you until the end of the way and
[48:38] so now how many of you think that he's
[48:40] going to get to my house number two is a
[48:43] better option isn't it so the only thing
[48:45] that he's got to do is listen to the
[48:47] voice that's guiding him he's got to
[48:49] listen to the instructions that are
[48:51] given to him and God needs those real
[48:53] and God will Don't Clap Don't Clap I
[48:56] don't have
[48:58] time he's got to listen whenever God
[49:00] corrects him he's got to listen whenever
[49:03] he Bears on the wrong pathway he's got
[49:05] to do urns along the way he's got to say
[49:08] oh sorry I made the wrong turn turn to
[49:10] quickly and he's got to uh make
[49:12] adjustments to his pathway but he's
[49:14] confident that I know where my house is
[49:17] and he's resting in that
[49:24] leadership BL just give the
[49:33] hand things to God I will tell you
[49:35] that's exactly how he wants you to live
[49:37] your life don't try to figure it out
[49:39] don't try to make all the decisions
[49:41] yourself don't try to lead yourself he
[49:43] is in you to lead you and guide you to
[49:46] the end of the world and he knows
[49:48] exactly where you need to be and he
[49:49] knows exactly how to get you there you
[49:51] just pay attention to him and make sure
[49:53] that whatever he says you listen to that
[49:55] and act on it because you need to be not
[49:57] only a hearer of the word but a doer of
[49:59] the word as well let's pray Heavenly
[50:03] Father we thank you for your goodness
[50:04] and your mercy we thank you for your
[50:06] word and your love to us we're resting
[50:09] on the fact that Lord you are our guide
[50:11] you are our comforter Lord we want to be
[50:13] found in the will of almighty God in
[50:16] every phase of Life you've given all
[50:18] these young people Lord a season in
[50:19] which to live in their singleness I pray
[50:21] that they would take advantage of that
[50:23] and Lord they would be used of you and
[50:25] they would be trained by you and they'd
[50:27] be molded by you and they would be
[50:29] shaped by you in their thinking and
[50:30] their understanding and not in the
[50:32] wokeness of the world but Lord in the
[50:35] reality of the truth of scripture and I
[50:37] pray that you would guide them and lead
[50:39] them Lord because you promised you said
[50:41] you never leave us nor forsake us and
[50:43] Lord we're resting on them bless our day
[50:46] we commit it to you Lord we give it to
[50:47] you like an offering we present our
[50:49] bodies as living sacrifices holy and
[50:51] acceptable unto you because that's our
[50:54] reasonable service we love you we thank
[50:57] you Lord and we appreciate the
[50:59] opportunity Lord to learn from your word
[51:02] in Jesus name we pray and all God's
[51:05] people said amen Amen brother Anthony
