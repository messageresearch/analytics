[43:27] like crazy

[43:57] couple other requests that i'm praying
[43:59] about so amen but amen we got a full
[44:02] team here of ministry my
[44:04] wonderful god has gifted us and
[44:07] uh we had uh actually brother caleb was
[44:10] in the saddle for wednesday and we had
[44:12] to pull the plug and we didn't get a
[44:14] whole lot as usual i learned what me and
[44:17] brother eddie used to learn uh me and
[44:19] jonathan when we were painting that
[44:20] around here you don't you hear this
[44:22] terrible forecast you don't pay much
[44:24] attention to it because a lot of times
[44:26] it doesn't pan out at all but
[44:28] i apologize you know that we we have no
[44:30] choice when you know we get such a dire
[44:32] warning and they were saying you know
[44:34] hail and tornadoes and flooding and
[44:37] there's no way the stakes are too high
[44:39] can't risk the lives of people driving
[44:41] and so we had to cancel our wednesday

[49:22] and so uh he also is requesting
[49:26] continue prayer
[49:28] for his
[49:30] um
[49:31] i'm getting a notice from a streamer
[49:33] there's no volume coming through on the

[49:39] rodney is saying they're not getting
[49:41] much volume
[49:42] amen um brother mark has requested

[49:51] he has congestive heart failure
[49:54] there's fluid on his heart
[49:56] and they have to go in and drain it
[49:58] because his heart isn't pumping the way
[50:00] it should they said there is really
[50:02] nothing
[50:03] that can be done
[50:04] amen for that but we know something we
[50:07] know someone
[50:08] a man who can take that case and amen
[50:11] and turn it around um got to request
[50:14] from sister phyllis concerning her
[50:16] daughter anna who we all know and love
[50:18] and
[50:19] she was admitted into the hospital with
[50:21] kidney stones they
[50:23] they put a stint and then in and center
[50:25] back home temporarily till they can get
[50:27] her back this week for laser surgery to
[50:30] try to
[50:32] reduce the size of the stones she's in a
[50:34] tremendous amount of pain and nausea so
[50:36] we're praying for a good outcome
[50:39] on all of that brother donnie wrote to
[50:41] me this morning and asked special prayer
[50:43] for his daughter erica
[50:46] she
[50:47] um she starts another treatment her
[50:50] chemotherapy tomorrow
[50:52] you remember we were praying and and the
[50:53] lord she became cancer free and we had
[50:56] great victory
[50:57] uh but the devil just doesn't go away
[50:59] easily and he's tried to make a
[51:00] re-emergence and so she's had to go back
[51:03] in for some treatment
[51:04] and you know friends i'd i just say
[51:07] you know in my heart i don't know maybe
[51:09] it seems like the lord's given me a
[51:10] special burden for it
[51:12] and uh i i i just want to say that we
[51:15] should just all agree this shall not
[51:17] stand
[51:18] amen and i believe that we should speak
[51:20] against it i believe friends that
[51:23] there's power and prayer i believe when
[51:25] the saints of god bind together and it's
[51:28] not just something passive i think that
[51:31] you got a need today i don't know what
[51:32] it might be you might have a need not on
[51:34] my list today speak against that thing
[51:37] speak against the devil speak it out
[51:39] into the atmosphere that's what jesus
[51:41] did he actually spoke out and it went
[51:43] into the spirit world and he called a
[51:45] young girl's life back to her and and
[51:48] and i i believe that there's there's
[51:51] power when we are claiming the promise
[51:53] of god whatever you do
[51:55] don't take the devil's attack sitting
[51:57] down
[51:59] amen whatever you do claim brother
[52:01] branham said take your token and and
[52:04] bring it it's a it's a badge of
[52:06] authority to say back off satan amen i
[52:10] think it should be a claim in our homes
[52:12] and our churches and our families i
[52:14] think we ought to speak freedom and
[52:16] speak deliverance and speak every need
[52:19] that we have amen and claim it in the
[52:21] name of the lord jesus christ it's not
[52:24] it's not charismatic name it claim it
[52:26] it's taking the promise of god brother
[52:28] branham said if you take any promise of
[52:31] god and put it on your lips
[52:33] and say it brother branham said that's
[52:35] the same as deity speaking
[52:39] now how many want to make a claim
[52:41] amen
[52:42] let's pray father in the name of the
[52:44] lord jesus we're bringing these needs
[52:46] before you today and we're believing
[52:49] lord for our sister elizabeth that
[52:51] you'll recover her quickly we're
[52:53] believing lord that brother george and
[52:55] sister andrea will have a a a a a
[52:58] wonderful outcome father they'll be able
[53:01] to go and spread the love and the grace
[53:03] of god to a hurting family lord i pray

[53:09] our dear brother mark lord and his
[53:10] brother josh lord and we we still stand
[53:14] firm without backing up one inch lord
[53:16] that the prayer we've been praying for

[53:20] that we are claiming complete victory
[53:23] lord we speak it out into the atmosphere

[53:28] brothers be made completely whole for
[53:31] your glory lord for our own sister anna

[53:48] there's brother donning sister carol
[53:50] lord oh father what a what a pressure
[53:53] must be upon their hearts if i think if
[53:55] it was my own child lord we're claiming
[53:58] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[54:00] that our sister should be made free of
[54:02] this once and for all lord we condemn
[54:05] the work of the enemy he is our enemy
[54:08] and he is your enemy and we claim
[54:11] victory in all of these needs today lord
[54:14] and we commit it to you now in the name
[54:17] of jesus christ our lord
[54:19] and the whole church said
[54:22] amen praise the name of the lord god
[54:24] bless you we're going to
[54:26] invite you
[54:28] amen just now
[54:30] um
[54:31] we're going to go to
[54:33] in our scriptures to galatians chapter 4
[54:37] and we're going to read a couple of the
[54:39] in beginning verses
[54:41] from verse 1
[54:43] and we will then let you be seated and
[54:45] we will carry on uh reading
[54:49] amen praise the lord
[54:54] now
[54:55] from galatians chapter 4
[54:58] we begin with verse 1.
[55:04] now i say that the heir as long as he is
[55:07] a child
[55:09] differeth nothing from a servant
[55:12] though he be lord of all
[55:15] but as under tutors and governors until
[55:17] the time appointed of the father
[55:20] even so we when we were children were in
[55:23] bondage under the elements of the world
[55:27] but when the fullness of time was come
[55:30] god sent forth his son made of a woman
[55:32] made under the law
[55:34] to redeem them that were under the law
[55:37] that we might receive the adoption of
[55:39] sons
[55:40] and because ye are sons god has sent
[55:44] forth the spirit of his son into your
[55:46] hearts crying abba father
[55:49] wherefore thou art no more a servant but
[55:52] a son and if a son
[55:55] then an heir of god through christ
[55:58] may the lord bless the reading of his
[56:00] word you can be seated and we'll carry
[56:01] on reading from verse 8.
[56:13] verse 8 how be it then
[56:17] when you knew not god
[56:19] you did service unto them
[56:22] which by nature are no gods
[56:25] but now
[56:27] after that ye have known god or rather
[56:29] are known of god
[56:31] how turn ye again to the weak and
[56:34] beggarly elements
[56:36] wherein to you desire again to be in
[56:38] bondage
[56:42] ye observe days and months and times and
[56:44] years i'm afraid of you lest i have
[56:46] bestowed upon you labor in vain
[56:50] brethren i beseech you
[56:52] be as i am for i am as ye are
[56:56] ye have not injured me at all you know
[56:58] how through infirmity of the flesh i
[57:01] preached the gospel unto you at the
[57:04] first
[57:05] and my temptation which was in my flesh
[57:07] he despised not nor rejected but
[57:09] received me as an angel of god even as
[57:12] christ jesus
[57:13] where is then the blessedness you speak
[57:16] of for i bear you record
[57:18] that if it had been possible you would
[57:20] have plucked out your own eyes and have
[57:22] given them to me am i therefore become
[57:24] your enemy because i tell you the truth
[57:27] they zealously affect you but not well
[57:30] yea they would exclude you that you
[57:33] might affect them
[57:34] but it is good to be zealously affected
[57:37] always in a good thing and not only when
[57:40] i am present with you
[57:42] now watch verse 19 and 20
[57:44] my little children
[57:46] of whom i travail in birth again
[57:49] until christ be formed in you
[57:53] i desire to be present with you now and
[57:55] to change my voice for i stand in doubt
[57:58] of you tell me ye that desire to be
[58:01] under the law do you not hear the law
[58:05] for it is written that adam had two sons
[58:07] the one by a bondwoman and the other by
[58:09] a free woman
[58:11] but he who was of the bondwoman was born
[58:13] after the flesh but he of the free woman
[58:16] was by
[58:18] promise which things are an allegory see
[58:21] it's a it's a bible imagery it's a type
[58:24] for these are the two covenants the one
[58:28] from mount sinai which gendereth to
[58:31] bondage which is hagar for this hagar in
[58:34] mount sinai in arabia
[58:37] and answereth to jerusalem which now is
[58:41] and is in bondage with her children
[58:43] but jerusalem which is above is free
[58:46] which is the mother of us all amen may
[58:50] the lord bless that reading
[58:53] you know
[58:54] it's interesting that paul would have to
[58:57] come to this
[58:58] argument with the church there
[59:01] of the galatians because
[59:03] paul had established them
[59:05] clearly apart from the law he had
[59:08] established them on the grace of god and
[59:11] what god had done for
[59:13] all humanity in his death burial and
[59:16] resurrection at calvary that day on
[59:19] calvary set us free
[59:20] from the bondage of the law
[59:23] and we find that a lot of times
[59:26] human beings tend to for a number of
[59:29] reasons but
[59:30] the outcome's never good you know either
[59:33] they
[59:34] either they they don't want to press
[59:37] through
[59:38] to what it it requires to really feel
[59:41] the freedom in the holy spirit or you
[59:43] know they have some complex that was
[59:46] sown in their life and they have a hard
[59:48] time getting over it and they they seem
[59:50] to where they they only find their worth
[59:54] uh in some kind of keeping of a legal
[59:56] code and some kind of legalistic
[59:58] approach and i can i can tell you that
[1:00:01] that paul said you know if you're going
[1:00:03] to take that path then for you at least
[1:00:07] calvary was in vain and christ died in
[1:00:09] vain because you're not even reaping the
[1:00:11] benefit now he didn't die in vain
[1:00:13] because there are some people who have
[1:00:15] believed the report
[1:00:18] and it is to those people who have
[1:00:19] believed the report that the arm of the
[1:00:22] lord is revealed and brother branham
[1:00:24] picks that up in the sixth seal about
[1:00:26] how that that that the that when the
[1:00:29] word is revealed and when you believe
[1:00:31] that word then the arm of the lord is
[1:00:34] revealed to you and if you if you just
[1:00:36] think that through you realize that a
[1:00:39] couple of things number one that god has
[1:00:41] been active in your life because you
[1:00:43] couldn't come to that revelation on your
[1:00:45] own god had to bring you to that
[1:00:47] revelation everything that you will ever
[1:00:49] have with eternal value is the grace of
[1:00:52] almighty god and god so loving the world
[1:00:56] that he would actually go to
[1:00:58] unimaginable links to save mankind god
[1:01:03] loves life and so we we find then that
[1:01:07] additionally if you think about how that
[1:01:10] the arm of the lord is revealed to you
[1:01:12] that god that that that now you have a
[1:01:15] responsibility because the arm of the
[1:01:17] lord came to you he god helped you he
[1:01:21] has revealed life to you you couldn't
[1:01:25] save yourself and so the only one who
[1:01:27] could save you saw your need
[1:01:30] looked beyond your fault saw your need
[1:01:33] looked beyond your mistakes sawned a
[1:01:36] seed and said i this is my child and
[1:01:40] regardless of what they've come through
[1:01:42] they're failures it doesn't matter i'm
[1:01:44] not going to lose them
[1:01:48] we rejoice in that today
[1:01:51] but now there's also the aspect if you
[1:01:54] if you continue to think it through and
[1:01:56] brother branham didn't go this direction
[1:01:58] in the sixth seal but in other places
[1:02:00] where he makes this case that you know
[1:02:03] we at the end
[1:02:04] at the end of an arm an arm is attached
[1:02:07] to a body and the end of an arm is a
[1:02:09] hand and it is the hand that performs
[1:02:11] the will through the arm comes from the
[1:02:13] mind and brother brandon would would say
[1:02:16] to us many times god has no hands but
[1:02:19] yours
[1:02:21] amen so when the arm of the lord is
[1:02:23] revealed to you you become the hand of
[1:02:26] god to the world
[1:02:28] you become those who you become one who
[1:02:30] brings mercy and says here i have mercy
[1:02:33] for you will you accept it and if they
[1:02:35] do you have you have been a a partaker
[1:02:38] you have been a participant in their
[1:02:40] eternal life you'll even have a a crown
[1:02:43] and you're a jewel in your crown
[1:02:46] for every time you've accomplished that
[1:02:51] people
[1:02:52] lose sight of that sometimes sometimes
[1:02:54] people keep it
[1:02:56] fixed firmly in their mind they're
[1:02:57] constantly witnessing
[1:02:59] you know i think about the the
[1:03:01] the chronicles of my dad and mom in
[1:03:03] their in their young years of witnessing
[1:03:06] the message and
[1:03:08] uh you know brother eddie and sister
[1:03:10] gene
[1:03:11] stand
[1:03:12] and and are responsible for entire
[1:03:15] churches coming into the message
[1:03:17] entire assemblies now just think
[1:03:19] exponentially how many of those went out
[1:03:22] and won somebody and preached the gospel
[1:03:24] i'm here to tell you there's going to be
[1:03:25] a lot of jewels in the crown of brother
[1:03:28] eddie and sister gene sister gene stills
[1:03:30] does it to this day i caught her the
[1:03:32] other day uh
[1:03:33] here she is you know i always get this
[1:03:36] wrong mom are you 81
[1:03:39] 81 years old and i called her up and i
[1:03:41] said hey what you doing she said oh i'm
[1:03:43] i'm i'm showing the films to my
[1:03:45] neighbors and i said wait wait what what
[1:03:48] films what said the film's deep called
[1:03:49] deep 20th century private i said who are
[1:03:51] you showing to she said my neighbors
[1:03:53] heard her and her son come down my mom
[1:03:55] sit in her living room with a church
[1:03:56] service showing the films
[1:03:59] and at 81 years old she's still finding
[1:04:02] somebody she's still trying to add gems
[1:04:04] and jewels to her crown i think that
[1:04:06] should be the vision of all of us
[1:04:09] see
[1:04:12] and so it was it was that gift as
[1:04:15] brother branham said to tim as brothers
[1:04:17] brother paul said to timothy it came
[1:04:18] through his mother lois and before that
[1:04:21] his grandmother eunice and
[1:04:22] and and we find that that ministering
[1:04:25] gift came upon me and i stand here in a
[1:04:27] pulpit today this is god's doing this is
[1:04:29] the hand of the lord
[1:04:31] and you know whenever we see god moving
[1:04:33] in our lives like this we ought to take
[1:04:36] notice and there ought to be some
[1:04:37] gratitude think of where you would be if
[1:04:39] you weren't here
[1:04:40] while i was talking to myself and and i
[1:04:43] was on the phone just the other day and
[1:04:44] brother chad lam and i we were just
[1:04:47] rejoicing over the grace of god and i
[1:04:49] saw i said my goodness brother chad well
[1:04:51] i've thought so many times what would
[1:04:54] what would i do if i didn't have this
[1:04:56] message what would i what would i tell
[1:04:58] my family how would i how would i have
[1:05:00] given hope to my children what would i
[1:05:01] say to my church i'd have no way to give
[1:05:04] them the assurance but but here's the
[1:05:06] reality i am a believer and a message
[1:05:09] did come and i did believe it and i do
[1:05:11] preach it and you have received it
[1:05:14] so let us be glad and rejoice for the
[1:05:18] marriage of the lamb has come and the
[1:05:20] bride has made herself ready
[1:05:26] brother branham says in in the message
[1:05:28] who is this melchizedek and i
[1:05:31] i deliberated with myself this morning
[1:05:34] whether to put these on powerpoints but
[1:05:35] i didn't have enough and i just want to
[1:05:37] read a couple of quotes to you
[1:05:39] and uh one is lengthy but i'll just make
[1:05:41] actually just referring to it because
[1:05:43] it's familiar
[1:05:45] but brother branham says here and who is
[1:05:47] this melchizedek
[1:05:49] he says when abraham met him he was
[1:05:51] melchizedek and this tremendous
[1:05:54] statement that the prophet makes
[1:05:56] he unfolds here now this is in the bible
[1:05:59] imagery of melchizedek
[1:06:02] he unfolds here what all the attributes
[1:06:05] will do
[1:06:06] in the final end every son of abraham
[1:06:10] every son of of of the faith will
[1:06:13] absolutely do the same thing but i want
[1:06:16] you to watch how we have to come brother
[1:06:18] anthony can i get a water please yeah uh
[1:06:21] how how that we have to i want you to
[1:06:23] watch how we have to come so
[1:06:25] brother branham goes on from there i'm
[1:06:27] not preaching on it today uh
[1:06:30] but but but what i am taking a title is
[1:06:33] journey to an experience because that's
[1:06:36] really what your life has been about in
[1:06:38] fact is you know israel israel had such
[1:06:42] such epic failures
[1:06:44] and god comes to them after many years
[1:06:46] and they've wandered in the desert and
[1:06:48] 40 years they went around the mountain
[1:06:50] around and around and around again and
[1:06:52] they took 40 years on a journey that
[1:06:53] should have taken less than a week
[1:06:56] and and they were still found and until
[1:06:58] finally god comes on the scene and
[1:07:00] finally says all right we're we're just
[1:07:03] moving on
[1:07:04] and and god took them across the jordan
[1:07:07] under joshua and you all know the story
[1:07:10] since your days of childhood in sunday
[1:07:12] school but
[1:07:13] but the point comes to where god
[1:07:16] comes to them and he's kind of going to
[1:07:18] give uh almost a a summation
[1:07:21] you know here's what's been happening i
[1:07:24] kind of want to bring you up to speed
[1:07:26] that you know you you see it as oh there
[1:07:29] was a great episode in egypt and you
[1:07:32] remember those stories well and the
[1:07:34] darkness and the flies and the frogs and
[1:07:36] the fleas thank you sir the frogs and
[1:07:38] the fleas and and you remember pharaoh's
[1:07:41] resistance and you remember the death of
[1:07:44] all the firstborn
[1:07:47] and and then how we came out with the
[1:07:49] mighty hand and
[1:07:51] here we've been and you remember the
[1:07:53] waters of marabou you remember the
[1:07:55] smiting of the rock you remember the
[1:07:58] fire that bur the mountain that burned
[1:08:00] with fire you remember the tablets of
[1:08:03] stone and and and you're you're you're
[1:08:05] seeing all of this as history and this
[1:08:07] was our lives and this this was our uh
[1:08:10] these were our trials and these were our
[1:08:12] testings and we had successes and
[1:08:14] failures and a lot more failures than we
[1:08:16] wanted to talk about and god just comes
[1:08:18] down and he sums it up and he said i
[1:08:20] sent you on a journey
[1:08:24] that's really all that was happening
[1:08:26] and you know you never really caught
[1:08:28] that you just you you lived as if i was
[1:08:32] making it up on the fly
[1:08:34] you you had your problems and you cried
[1:08:37] out and you murmured and you complained
[1:08:39] you you were unaware that you were just
[1:08:41] on a journey
[1:08:43] you were just on a journey
[1:08:45] i was i was leading you somewhere for
[1:08:47] your good and everything was
[1:08:49] was to take it in that direction and and
[1:08:52] and you really you missed out on so much
[1:08:55] and people today
[1:08:56] miss out on just that simple concept say
[1:08:58] oh i'm i'm here i was born i had a life
[1:09:01] i've got past i've got memories i've had
[1:09:02] this i had a job had a career i had a
[1:09:04] person in my life i had this i had that
[1:09:06] or
[1:09:07] you've spent a tremendous amount of your
[1:09:09] time saying i got to get a job or i got
[1:09:11] to get a person or i got to have this i
[1:09:13] got to have that you're just on a
[1:09:15] journey
[1:09:16] you're just it's this is just a little
[1:09:19] whistle stop as i've said before you're
[1:09:21] just passing through
[1:09:24] as i as i made the comment to you last
[1:09:26] sunday i said yeah we have trials but
[1:09:29] you you'd face your trials with a lot
[1:09:32] more endurance if you would just change
[1:09:34] the word trial
[1:09:36] to training
[1:09:38] because that's really
[1:09:40] what it is
[1:09:41] that's exactly what it is you say well
[1:09:44] but i you know i i did something wrong
[1:09:47] and i reaped what i sowed and it was a
[1:09:49] terrible consequence and so god being
[1:09:52] god
[1:09:52] uses that for a teachable moment
[1:09:56] just like a parent would
[1:09:58] we have what we call teachable moments i
[1:10:01] used to invent them if i if my boys were
[1:10:03] too good
[1:10:05] and they were never in trouble i would
[1:10:08] just say man something's wrong with this
[1:10:09] picture i'm going to have to create a
[1:10:11] scenario and create me a teachable
[1:10:13] moment now i wasn't planning to drop the
[1:10:15] lower the boom on them i just wanted
[1:10:17] some more training and so i'd create a
[1:10:19] scenario and almost almost impossible
[1:10:22] for them to to pass and and in their
[1:10:24] failure then i could come sweeping in
[1:10:26] like the hero and fix it and do it for
[1:10:28] them and say now boys sit down let me
[1:10:29] show you why this happened
[1:10:31] because i i you hear my son's laughing
[1:10:34] and they're they're saying it didn't
[1:10:36] wasn't actually that good the way you're
[1:10:38] telling it
[1:10:41] amen don't ask them they don't know
[1:10:43] anything and so
[1:10:45] so but i but you know i i saw that as a
[1:10:49] responsibility i was a proactive parent
[1:10:53] i i saw that i have a responsibility
[1:10:55] there's more to being a parent than just
[1:10:57] keeping them safe and fed and warm and
[1:11:00] protected
[1:11:01] i'm growing them to something i'm trying
[1:11:03] to i'm trying to produce something i
[1:11:06] have a commission that that they're the
[1:11:09] heritage of god and i'm i'm here trying
[1:11:11] to mold them and i and i would say you
[1:11:14] know when when sometimes there'd be
[1:11:15] resistance i'd say listen son you you've
[1:11:18] got to realize dad is not the obstacle
[1:11:21] of your manhood don't i'm not ever going
[1:11:23] to let satan i would say to parents
[1:11:24] everywhere don't let satan paint you
[1:11:26] that way that you're the obstacle to
[1:11:28] their manhood i became their advocate i
[1:11:30] said i want you to move into manhood you
[1:11:33] need to move into manhood but but with
[1:11:35] that comes responsibility
[1:11:37] it's not life's not fair and it's
[1:11:39] certainly not free and you you need
[1:11:42] there's things that you can do on your
[1:11:44] way to becoming a better man
[1:11:47] and i would say someday
[1:11:49] i got a like a little boat i got to take
[1:11:51] you and set you on the sea of life and
[1:11:53] give you a little shove and i gotta have
[1:11:56] you ready
[1:11:57] so you know give me some grace here i
[1:11:59] gotta have you ready i'm not doing these
[1:12:02] things because i'm i'm it's not
[1:12:03] punishment because i'm some evil person
[1:12:06] i it's punishment because it's it's it's
[1:12:09] a corrective measure because i i see
[1:12:12] what this will come to down the road if
[1:12:14] i don't fix it now
[1:12:16] and in spite of best efforts you still
[1:12:18] being a human still mess up st i didn't
[1:12:21] always get it right and there were times
[1:12:23] when i had to sit down and sit down to a
[1:12:25] young man and here i am the older adult
[1:12:28] and have to look him in the eye and go
[1:12:29] dad was wrong and i'm sorry
[1:12:31] see but but you know that then that
[1:12:33] genders respect that that causes that
[1:12:36] you always want to have it to where
[1:12:38] you're you're trying to create a desire
[1:12:41] in that child you don't want to force
[1:12:44] them god doesn't want to force you
[1:12:46] god wants you to love him and be and he
[1:12:49] wants you to feel his love amen my and
[1:12:53] so so so this whole idea that paul is
[1:12:56] bringing
[1:12:58] to
[1:12:59] to the church in galatia
[1:13:01] at galatia he's saying listen i i
[1:13:05] like like my children
[1:13:08] i'm laboring till i see christ formed in
[1:13:12] you
[1:13:13] this is my whole desire say brother
[1:13:15] jason why why do you keep keep this up
[1:13:18] why are you pressing you know for this
[1:13:20] with with such an urgency and i and i've
[1:13:22] been speaking on it a lot you know this
[1:13:25] whole year we started with a lengthy
[1:13:27] series and you know what is the church
[1:13:29] of god and i've got a lot of feedback
[1:13:31] from that series it was lengthy and and
[1:13:33] then we we went there to approaching
[1:13:35] perfection and then i had a whole bunch
[1:13:37] of stuff in between scattered throughout
[1:13:39] and and why do i have such an urgency
[1:13:42] and all i can tell you is it's the same
[1:13:44] spirit on me that was on saint paul when
[1:13:47] he said my little children because
[1:13:49] that's what i feel like i when i look
[1:13:51] out mr debbie and i feel that way it
[1:13:53] might seem upside down to you but that's
[1:13:55] how we feel it's like you're our
[1:13:57] children like you're our family and some
[1:13:58] of you are senior to me but paul said my
[1:14:01] little children of whom i travail in
[1:14:04] birth again until christ be formed in
[1:14:08] you
[1:14:09] hallelujah a perfect example of growth
[1:14:12] after the new birth after the holy ghost
[1:14:14] you're going to grow in the grace of god
[1:14:17] amen
[1:14:23] god has a throne
[1:14:25] that the bible teaches us
[1:14:28] is established in mercy
[1:14:34] and that can never change
[1:14:37] this throne that is established in mercy
[1:14:41] means that he does everything he can
[1:14:45] and works
[1:14:46] tirelessly
[1:14:48] morning noon and night
[1:14:51] to keep you
[1:14:53] from going to hell
[1:14:58] god doesn't take pleasure
[1:15:01] in death
[1:15:02] not even
[1:15:04] of a sinner
[1:15:07] the bible teaches us that he doesn't
[1:15:08] take pleasure even in the death of a
[1:15:11] sinner he sets barricades in your path
[1:15:15] to keep you from going there hell wasn't
[1:15:17] even built for humans
[1:15:19] it's an overcrowded prison because it
[1:15:21] wasn't built for humans it was built for
[1:15:23] the devil and his angels
[1:15:25] and mankind was never supposed to go
[1:15:28] there now the cruelty of sin
[1:15:31] and and the choice that mankind made in
[1:15:34] genesis
[1:15:35] and don't now don't get uppity and blame
[1:15:38] adam and eve because the world today is
[1:15:40] still making the same choice
[1:15:43] and i just say well look when when god
[1:15:45] was in control of everything it was a
[1:15:47] perfect world are you ready to give him
[1:15:48] control again of your whole life well no
[1:15:50] okay okay then if you're not don't blame
[1:15:53] adam and eve because you're still making
[1:15:54] the same choice
[1:15:56] it's before us all we have to make that
[1:15:59] choice we are born
[1:16:01] in sin
[1:16:02] and you know and and so god sets
[1:16:05] barricades and brother branham says if
[1:16:07] you go to hell
[1:16:09] you'll send yourself there
[1:16:12] because god will try every way he can to
[1:16:15] block you off from it and you just keep
[1:16:16] stepping over the barricades
[1:16:20] and so therefore brother branham would
[1:16:22] correlate
[1:16:23] uh we we a lot of times we talk about
[1:16:25] blasphemy of the holy ghost
[1:16:27] and i i just want to say uh a little bit
[1:16:30] about it i've i've hit at it in bits and
[1:16:33] pieces in in the last couple sermons but
[1:16:35] i really want to conclusively walk you
[1:16:37] through this today and i've spent a lot
[1:16:39] of time thinking about this
[1:16:42] and brother branham would correlate
[1:16:44] blasphemy of the holy ghost and a lot of
[1:16:47] times
[1:16:48] you'll hear him
[1:16:50] describe it as crossing the line
[1:16:53] between judgment and mercy
[1:16:56] from which there's no coming back
[1:16:59] because as paul
[1:17:00] taught the church in hebrews and romans
[1:17:03] and different places that
[1:17:05] that once you cross that line
[1:17:08] there's no more sacrifice for your sin
[1:17:10] and the only way
[1:17:12] you could ever be saved is if jesus came
[1:17:14] back and did it all over again and he's
[1:17:16] not going to do that
[1:17:17] see
[1:17:19] so so it leaves you in the wind and and
[1:17:22] and and so
[1:17:24] when we talk about crossing the line of
[1:17:26] judgment and mercy
[1:17:27] and brother branham said when you do
[1:17:29] that you blaspheme the holy ghost or
[1:17:31] will you cross the line between judgment
[1:17:33] and mercy you actually will never desire
[1:17:37] god again which is
[1:17:39] helpful if you're sitting here today and
[1:17:42] you still got a desire
[1:17:44] it proves you haven't crossed the line
[1:17:47] or otherwise you would never desire it
[1:17:49] again you couldn't make yourself desire
[1:17:50] it see
[1:17:52] even if you were aware as brother
[1:17:54] branham matt was you know reading to us
[1:17:56] yesterday in our
[1:17:58] men's
[1:18:00] bible study breakfast
[1:18:02] and uh brother travis did the lesson for
[1:18:05] us and i i'm so glad we have him as a
[1:18:07] sunday school teacher be glad we have
[1:18:09] brother travis teaching your children
[1:18:11] out here in the class i said travis
[1:18:13] that's that's the greatest sermon on
[1:18:15] overcoming that's the greatest sermon
[1:18:17] i've ever heard in the entire world all
[1:18:19] my life
[1:18:20] and uh and i meant it quite sincerely
[1:18:24] and as you i think you young people
[1:18:26] did he go that way again brother rome uh
[1:18:28] yeah so brother owen got got a double
[1:18:30] barrel shotgun of it he was at the men's
[1:18:33] he was at the men's uh bible study where
[1:18:35] all your other teenage guys
[1:18:37] at the men's it's the men's breakfast
[1:18:39] you say i want i'm a man i want you to
[1:18:41] think of me out as a man i'd like to
[1:18:44] i'd like to i'd love to love to think of
[1:18:46] you as a man like to see you sitting at
[1:18:48] a men's breakfast bible study
[1:18:50] amen so enough of that amen
[1:18:52] amen so but but it was it was so
[1:18:55] wonderful on
[1:18:57] on the practical steps that it takes to
[1:18:59] be an overcomer you remember as i said
[1:19:02] to you recently and i i paraphrased the
[1:19:05] quote
[1:19:06] where brother branham said there's some
[1:19:07] things god is just not going to do
[1:19:09] because he's waiting for you to do it
[1:19:11] see there's some things that you you see
[1:19:13] people come to the altar
[1:19:15] and get get the new birth in a real and
[1:19:18] living fire-breathing way
[1:19:20] and god just takes habits out of their
[1:19:22] life and and cleans them up and the
[1:19:24] whole desire for drinking and smoking or
[1:19:27] drugs or whatever that whatever their
[1:19:29] vice was or all of their vices suddenly
[1:19:31] it's gone
[1:19:33] and they're they're at a loss to explain
[1:19:35] how it's gone and where it went it's
[1:19:36] just gone see but then there's also
[1:19:39] those things that you remember you're
[1:19:41] still in a broken body of sin and flesh
[1:19:45] and you're born with different
[1:19:46] weaknesses and different propensities
[1:19:47] and
[1:19:48] and satan knows how we're building and
[1:19:50] the callings and gifts on our lives and
[1:19:52] he satan has a tailored plan he has a
[1:19:55] file with your name on it
[1:19:57] and he spends a lot of time when you
[1:19:59] were just a baby no bigger than sister
[1:20:02] lana who we dedicated today he's already
[1:20:05] started compiling her file
[1:20:09] i'm glad jesus has a file over also
[1:20:12] hallelujah her name is on a book of life
[1:20:15] and the enemy's never gonna the enemy's
[1:20:17] foul is going to be disregarded
[1:20:20] hallelujah and we're going to fight his
[1:20:22] plan in prayer
[1:20:24] hallelujah we're going to preach the
[1:20:26] the unsearchable riches of christ and
[1:20:28] we're going to live an example before
[1:20:31] our children amen
[1:20:34] and
[1:20:35] we we find that
[1:20:37] god loves life and
[1:20:40] you know this would explain when you
[1:20:42] when you think about blasphemy of the
[1:20:44] holy ghost tonight i'm not going to take
[1:20:45] the passages to read it today it would
[1:20:47] slow me down too much
[1:20:49] but you can find it in matthew and and
[1:20:52] you can find it in luke and you can find
[1:20:54] it in
[1:20:55] in mark and
[1:20:56] where jesus talks about how that to
[1:20:58] speak a word against the son of man can
[1:21:01] be forgiven you in fact is in matthew he
[1:21:02] says all manner of sin and blasphemy
[1:21:06] all manner of it
[1:21:08] will be forgiven you however
[1:21:10] when the holy ghost comes and this is a
[1:21:12] paraphrase because i'm i'm mashing all
[1:21:14] three passages up when the when the era
[1:21:17] of the holy ghost because that was the
[1:21:19] christian era
[1:21:20] christ was on the scene he was he was
[1:21:22] alive those three and a half years that
[1:21:24] was the christian era the era we're in
[1:21:27] now is the era of the holy ghost we're
[1:21:29] in the holy ghost era that same jesus is
[1:21:32] living in his church
[1:21:34] the very same one
[1:21:35] not another jesus but the very same
[1:21:38] jesus is now living in his church in a
[1:21:41] many membered multi multiple-membered
[1:21:44] body around the world this was always
[1:21:46] god's plan this is what brother brown
[1:21:48] said in melchizedek we see
[1:21:50] this imagery we see what what god is
[1:21:52] bringing every sun in melchizedek you
[1:21:54] know hundreds of years
[1:21:56] before calvary before the holy ghost
[1:21:59] that you're seeing in melchizedek what
[1:22:01] every son of god is going to come to
[1:22:03] what was melchizedek he was the word
[1:22:05] made flesh
[1:22:06] it's a human being formed by the word of
[1:22:08] god see and so so we find that's why
[1:22:11] brother branham would say we don't see
[1:22:12] him no more because he becomes jesus
[1:22:15] christ same person not a different
[1:22:17] person only the same god in a different
[1:22:19] form
[1:22:20] and and and so now
[1:22:22] so now when we when we come forward
[1:22:25] this
[1:22:26] this would explain why some people
[1:22:29] can actually appear to blaspheme the
[1:22:31] holy spirit and yet not actually do it
[1:22:34] and later come to saving grace
[1:22:36] and you've seen that happen see
[1:22:39] and then while others at the same time
[1:22:42] uh we we find that others with almost
[1:22:45] with almost no effort at all
[1:22:47] cross that line early
[1:22:50] and have no forgiveness in this life for
[1:22:52] the life to come
[1:22:55] brother branham talks about a prayer
[1:22:56] line
[1:22:58] we're in a meeting and he says it was so
[1:23:01] sad to him
[1:23:02] he said here was an altar this was in
[1:23:04] his previous meeting he's now in a
[1:23:05] meeting given testimony and he's trying
[1:23:07] to tell the people don't wait don't wait
[1:23:10] come now while the spirit is calling he
[1:23:11] said i was just in a meeting and he said
[1:23:13] it was so so hard to see
[1:23:15] young people
[1:23:16] up around the altar crying they were
[1:23:19] crying real tears
[1:23:21] trying to repent and he said but i could
[1:23:23] look down in there by that gift and know
[1:23:25] it was already too late
[1:23:28] they had already sent away their day of
[1:23:30] grace
[1:23:31] he said well i thought they would never
[1:23:32] desire it again you can still get caught
[1:23:34] up in an emotional moment
[1:23:36] you could still come under
[1:23:38] i mean uh you know when we talk about we
[1:23:41] talk about how that you know jacob and
[1:23:43] esau and we find that he saw sought
[1:23:46] repentance with with tears bitter tears
[1:23:48] but he found it not
[1:23:50] see because you can't just go you say
[1:23:52] well isn't salvation a free gift well
[1:23:54] sure it is of course but you can't steal
[1:23:56] it
[1:23:58] see it has to be offered to you
[1:24:01] it is free but you can't just take it
[1:24:03] it's got to be offered and that's why
[1:24:05] god is only ever
[1:24:07] obligated to offer it to a person one
[1:24:09] time and then he's just
[1:24:10] if he never offers it to him again he's
[1:24:12] still just because he did and they
[1:24:14] rejected it and it might not even be the
[1:24:16] full word it might just be something of
[1:24:18] his divine nature it's his divine
[1:24:20] character in nature and you you just
[1:24:22] reject that and and and believe some
[1:24:24] darwinian nonsense and at that point god
[1:24:28] thank god his throne is established in
[1:24:31] mercy and he told moses i reserve mercy
[1:24:34] for thousands
[1:24:36] and and and and and maybe he will keep
[1:24:39] coming again and again i'm glad he did
[1:24:41] for me
[1:24:43] how many are glad he didn't give up
[1:24:44] after one time
[1:24:47] oh my and even even even after coming to
[1:24:50] him we still have our ups and downs and
[1:24:52] our failures and we hit on and off again
[1:24:54] we get out of balance and we have to
[1:24:56] find our way coming back to him through
[1:24:58] prayer
[1:24:59] see
[1:25:00] and and and so
[1:25:02] but he's he's not obligated to do it
[1:25:04] he's just if he never does it again and
[1:25:07] and so you know everyone
[1:25:10] is given a legitimate chance
[1:25:14] by this loving god
[1:25:16] you know to we said this here in a bit
[1:25:19] in peace
[1:25:20] a sermon or two ago
[1:25:22] we made a reference to brother branham's
[1:25:24] terrible dilemma as a child terrible
[1:25:26] thing to put a child through that
[1:25:28] catholic dogma brother branham said i
[1:25:30] was raised and thought that here was
[1:25:31] what he was taught his parents got
[1:25:33] taught this and they innocently passed
[1:25:35] it on to little william that god he said
[1:25:38] i thought god hated me but jesus loved
[1:25:40] me
[1:25:42] what a trauma to put a child's mind
[1:25:44] through
[1:25:45] that this all-powerful god hates him
[1:25:48] but jesus is a loving savior who's
[1:25:50] trying to help him
[1:25:52] and you know the devil's always trying
[1:25:54] to make it confusing like that i'm glad
[1:25:56] that the the mighty god has been
[1:25:58] unveiled
[1:25:59] and i'm glad we're not in confusion on
[1:26:01] who jesus is
[1:26:03] amen i'm glad we're not in confusion on
[1:26:05] god's plan before the foundation of the
[1:26:07] world
[1:26:09] and so so what you find then is that
[1:26:12] you know that that that that god gives
[1:26:15] every
[1:26:16] man an opportunity he even gave
[1:26:19] cain an opportunity even knowing that
[1:26:22] cain couldn't take it and
[1:26:24] it wasn't necessarily an opportunity to
[1:26:26] receive abel's revelation cain wasn't
[1:26:27] predestinated to that but he still told
[1:26:30] him if you'll just do as your brother
[1:26:32] does
[1:26:32] if you'll just respect his life in your
[1:26:35] life show respects to him in your life
[1:26:38] i'll find a way i'll find a place for
[1:26:40] you i'll save you
[1:26:41] and even even jesus offers judas a pause
[1:26:45] judas hold on betrayeth thou the son of
[1:26:47] man with a kiss you sure think son think
[1:26:50] you sure that's what you want to do
[1:26:52] see
[1:26:53] and and so so we find then that
[1:26:56] that
[1:26:57] that
[1:26:58] sometimes in our in our minds you know
[1:27:00] we can we can we can think of you know
[1:27:03] esau uh jacob have i loved he saw have i
[1:27:06] hated that's an absolute truth but yeah
[1:27:09] you have to understand that that that
[1:27:11] god that doesn't mean god ever stops
[1:27:14] loving all life
[1:27:17] that doesn't mean that god ever
[1:27:19] diminishes don't ever have god
[1:27:20] diminishing
[1:27:22] don't ever think that somehow his
[1:27:25] justice diminishes his love
[1:27:28] or that his love sets aside his justice
[1:27:31] because if he loses either one he's
[1:27:33] subtracted
[1:27:34] you understand so he's perfectly loving
[1:27:37] and perfectly just in all things
[1:27:39] see
[1:27:41] and so so with so then to think of god
[1:27:43] as someone who hates you but that jesus
[1:27:45] loves you the truth is that god tries to
[1:27:48] save everybody that is willing to be
[1:27:51] saved
[1:27:52] but you can it is a
[1:27:54] fact of humanity
[1:27:56] that you can keep rejecting the holy
[1:27:59] ghost to the point where you cross the
[1:28:02] line between judgment and mercy or as
[1:28:05] sometimes we might we might use a
[1:28:08] different term and say he's blasphemed
[1:28:10] the holy ghost and and they're
[1:28:12] technically different but ultimately
[1:28:15] you're
[1:28:16] you're doomed for almost the same reason
[1:28:19] amen
[1:28:22] because with that final rejecting of
[1:28:25] what we would say one time too many
[1:28:28] you cut yourself off from the holy
[1:28:30] spirit
[1:28:31] the only one
[1:28:33] who can lead you to repentance
[1:28:36] see
[1:28:38] this is a critical failure because you
[1:28:40] can't come on your own
[1:28:42] and the the end
[1:28:45] in the end
[1:28:46] it becomes a fatal decision
[1:28:50] for you
[1:28:51] to reject him
[1:28:53] one time too many
[1:28:57] and you've rejected the holy ghost
[1:28:59] whether you're speaking against the
[1:29:00] working of the holy ghost say oh if
[1:29:02] somebody speaks against the holy ghost
[1:29:03] they're doomed well they might be
[1:29:06] jesus said you're in danger
[1:29:08] of eternal damnation
[1:29:10] you're at least you're in danger of it
[1:29:11] you better be careful but but i've heard
[1:29:13] people reject the message only later to
[1:29:16] receive it
[1:29:18] i've known people who received it then
[1:29:20] left it then came back to it
[1:29:22] see so this this is god's mind i'm glad
[1:29:26] god's in control i'm glad god looks at
[1:29:29] the heart it's not you and me deciding
[1:29:32] i remember one time a a deacon in a
[1:29:35] church i went to he was talking to a
[1:29:37] peach farmer he was talking about how
[1:29:39] you know they've got bad ones and and he
[1:29:41] says the bad ones are all on the ground
[1:29:43] they didn't have enough to hold on and
[1:29:46] nature
[1:29:47] you know evicted them from the tree
[1:29:50] and he says he says well he says if
[1:29:52] that's the case he says why why do you
[1:29:55] wait
[1:29:56] why do you let it encumber and use up
[1:29:58] all the use up all the nutrients why why
[1:30:01] don't you just go ahead and climb up in
[1:30:03] the tree and take away all the bad ones
[1:30:05] and he says oh you can't do that
[1:30:07] he says why not he said because you
[1:30:08] can't tell which is which
[1:30:11] he said you might pull a good one off
[1:30:12] thinking because it looks like a bad one
[1:30:15] and you say oh this thing is so bad it's
[1:30:16] hopeless it's got to be and i'm just
[1:30:18] going to pull it off and toss it on the
[1:30:19] ground and that was actually gonna turn
[1:30:21] around and become healthy
[1:30:23] and then he says you you can't he says
[1:30:26] oh well then why don't you just take it
[1:30:28] and tape it back he said it won't it
[1:30:30] won't take hold you can't do that once
[1:30:32] you cut it from its life source so you
[1:30:34] know there
[1:30:35] here's our life source and i don't ever
[1:30:38] want to find myself making the decision
[1:30:41] to cut you off from the life source
[1:30:44] i just want to keep trusting god and
[1:30:46] keep believing and keep pressing the
[1:30:48] battle and keep preaching because i've
[1:30:50] seen a lot of rejection only later to
[1:30:53] come back in repentance
[1:30:56] and become some of the finest character
[1:30:59] people you would ever want to be around
[1:31:01] every one of us in here have that
[1:31:03] testimony how we ran from god every one
[1:31:05] of us had that testimony some of us
[1:31:08] almost atheist and god rich had mercy in
[1:31:11] a moment came down with his word and
[1:31:14] changed your whole heart and life
[1:31:21] but there is the truth that you can go
[1:31:23] too far and
[1:31:24] in the end it becomes a fatal decision
[1:31:26] you'll never have forgiveness in this
[1:31:28] life or the world to come
[1:31:30] see
[1:31:33] with the holy ghost
[1:31:36] say well cross the line of judgment
[1:31:38] mercy how how does that
[1:31:40] how does that why does it work like that
[1:31:42] because
[1:31:44] with the holy ghost finished calling you
[1:31:47] you would never desire god again
[1:31:51] not in any meaningful way
[1:31:53] you know mankind tries to comprehend god
[1:31:56] in his mind
[1:31:57] and you know however you imagine him
[1:32:00] whatever model
[1:32:01] you draw of him
[1:32:03] in your mind don't ever
[1:32:05] as i said last time don't ever have god
[1:32:08] say oh
[1:32:09] somebody blasphemes the holy ghost okay
[1:32:12] fine they blast from the holy ghost they
[1:32:13] cross the line i know that happens i
[1:32:14] know it happens it happens a lot more
[1:32:16] than you think it does
[1:32:18] and and they they literally become a
[1:32:20] living soul in prison now
[1:32:24] but
[1:32:24] in whatever way you imagine that for
[1:32:27] being fulfilled
[1:32:28] please don't have god
[1:32:31] sitting in a corner pouting
[1:32:33] angry spiteful and vengeful and since
[1:32:36] you hurt his feelings he's gonna burn
[1:32:38] you in a lake of fire
[1:32:41] because that's not the god of this book
[1:32:44] the god of this book loves life
[1:32:47] he loves all life
[1:32:49] he doesn't want anyone to die he says
[1:32:51] why will you die why will you not come
[1:32:53] to me and live he's not going to force
[1:32:56] himself on you because he's not
[1:32:57] interested in the kingdom of slaves he
[1:33:00] wants a kingdom of children
[1:33:03] who have been nurtured by him and love
[1:33:05] him and have learned to love him and
[1:33:08] grow to love him and let me tell you
[1:33:10] something friends that's why i
[1:33:11] constantly say our future is bright paul
[1:33:13] says it's never even entered your mind
[1:33:15] your imagination can't even comprehend
[1:33:18] the life brother branham says where
[1:33:20] we're going to live we're going to life
[1:33:23] oh my the world's not ending only the
[1:33:26] order of the world is changing
[1:33:29] the world can't end and somebody says
[1:33:31] the world's about to end no it's never
[1:33:33] going to end it's an eternal attribute
[1:33:34] of god but it is about to be renovated
[1:33:37] with a brand new government
[1:33:39] where jesus is going to be king say
[1:33:41] what's going to happen to all the
[1:33:42] sinners they're going to destroy
[1:33:44] themselves
[1:33:46] god's not going to destroy people in the
[1:33:48] tribulation they're going to be the
[1:33:49] victims of their own circumstance god's
[1:33:52] just simply going to pull out all the
[1:33:53] stops he's going to take a bride off the
[1:33:55] earth and all the blood is gone and then
[1:33:57] when you reject mercy and you reject the
[1:34:00] bleeding word then there's nothing left
[1:34:02] for you but the impending judgment which
[1:34:04] was already there the day you were born
[1:34:07] and god knowing it has tried forever to
[1:34:09] save you
[1:34:12] and if you end up in a tribulation you
[1:34:13] took yourself there
[1:34:16] that's why i've said it when you read
[1:34:18] the the great white throne judgment
[1:34:20] whether you read it from the book of
[1:34:21] revelation or whether you read it from
[1:34:22] matthew's gospel
[1:34:26] it's it's very loud
[1:34:29] on what you don't
[1:34:30] hear and what you don't hear that is
[1:34:34] deafeningly loud
[1:34:36] is anyone crying foul
[1:34:41] no one is carrying signs saying no
[1:34:44] justice
[1:34:46] no one is marching
[1:34:48] saying we want justice
[1:34:50] this ain't fair you don't find anyone
[1:34:53] saying that to him
[1:34:55] and i suppose there must be something
[1:34:58] about coming into his presence
[1:35:00] and when their life and the very
[1:35:02] thoughts of their heart are played back
[1:35:04] as brother bram said on god's big tv
[1:35:05] screen in the sky
[1:35:07] i think there is just a knowing at that
[1:35:09] moment
[1:35:11] you did it to yourself
[1:35:13] and i think that air you see what you
[1:35:15] see is everybody resigned to their fate
[1:35:17] and they just go off in silence there's
[1:35:19] no one kicking and screaming
[1:35:21] because they know at that point there's
[1:35:23] a knowing
[1:35:25] it wasn't it wasn't my parents fault it
[1:35:28] wasn't my preacher's fault it wasn't a
[1:35:31] deacon's fault it wasn't a boss's fault
[1:35:33] it wasn't something that happened to me
[1:35:34] here or something that happened to me
[1:35:36] there
[1:35:37] god rich in mercy chased me
[1:35:40] and i rejected him and rejected him and
[1:35:44] rejected him and wanted nothing to do
[1:35:46] with him
[1:35:50] if you if you rejected
[1:35:53] the
[1:35:54] spirit of god and the nature of god and
[1:35:57] the characteristics of god
[1:36:00] and you rejected the idea of having a
[1:36:02] life of righteousness and holiness in
[1:36:04] the spirit of the holy ghost
[1:36:06] why would you even want to go to heaven
[1:36:10] because it's going to be nothing but
[1:36:12] that
[1:36:15] amen
[1:36:17] so you wanted a life of revelry and
[1:36:19] darkness and sin well there's a place
[1:36:22] for that too
[1:36:24] and and and and and brother branham so
[1:36:27] god doesn't send any man to hell the man
[1:36:29] sends himself there man kind you know
[1:36:33] dooms himself
[1:36:35] you know
[1:36:36] he he
[1:36:37] that he dooms himself by rejecting this
[1:36:40] god of love and mercy say well business
[1:36:43] isn't the wrath and judgment sure yeah
[1:36:45] sure
[1:36:46] absolutely god god can and does
[1:36:49] pour out wrath pours out sometimes very
[1:36:52] uh even even even severe judgments
[1:36:56] but you know something friends truth is
[1:36:58] that that's largely people reaping what
[1:37:00] they sow
[1:37:02] and i mean i mean that that you know the
[1:37:04] laws of of nature and nature's god being
[1:37:08] just
[1:37:09] harvest must come
[1:37:12] and so quite naturally if you the the
[1:37:14] worst seed you sow the worst harvest
[1:37:17] you're going to reap that's just the
[1:37:18] laws of nature
[1:37:21] and god's nature see
[1:37:24] and so so we find then that that it it's
[1:37:27] not an injustice on god's part remember
[1:37:30] he could never diminish or subtract
[1:37:32] uh or be less god's constant nature and
[1:37:36] god's constant characteristic is mercy
[1:37:39] his constant characteristic is love his
[1:37:42] constant characteristic is kindness but
[1:37:45] his ju but it's but never at the cost of
[1:37:48] his justice
[1:37:50] his justice is never sacrificed for his
[1:37:53] love
[1:37:54] because then then you've diminished him
[1:37:57] so whether he's a
[1:37:59] loving somebody you think doesn't
[1:38:01] deserve it
[1:38:02] or somebody that or or or you've got a
[1:38:05] lot of judgment on you you don't know
[1:38:07] why i'm just here to tell you that
[1:38:10] everything god does is just all of his
[1:38:13] words are true and all of his ways are
[1:38:16] just
[1:38:18] i mean you know he he god god says to us
[1:38:22] to be angry and sin not so even in his
[1:38:25] anger and wrath he never sins
[1:38:29] see
[1:38:30] he's not a man that he should lies not a
[1:38:33] man that he should be
[1:38:35] petty
[1:38:36] you know moses talks about that in the
[1:38:38] book of of numbers 23 god is not a man
[1:38:40] that he should lie neither the son of
[1:38:42] man that he should repent has nothing to
[1:38:44] repent for see
[1:38:46] he moves by his never changing
[1:38:49] never failing word
[1:38:52] he's never a man that's arrogant and
[1:38:54] unforgiving that's not
[1:38:56] god his whole being is about life and he
[1:39:00] loves life he's a kind
[1:39:02] heavenly father he he was that fountain
[1:39:05] that brother bradham describes back
[1:39:07] before the aeons back before the heavens
[1:39:10] and the earth when god was alone he said
[1:39:11] back in the eternities he was that great
[1:39:14] fountain of love and out of that
[1:39:17] fountain poured and overflowed and ran
[1:39:20] down and he said in that overflow ran
[1:39:22] down his grace and his mercy and his
[1:39:25] kindness
[1:39:26] and his whole throne
[1:39:28] is built on top of that
[1:39:31] see
[1:39:34] all good things the bible teaches
[1:39:36] teaches us come down all good things
[1:39:39] come down from the father of lights
[1:39:41] see so humanity dooms itself
[1:39:44] by blaspheming the holy spirit and
[1:39:47] leaving himself without remedy proverbs
[1:39:49] 29 1 he that often re
[1:39:52] he that being often reproved hardeneth
[1:39:56] his neck shall suddenly be destroyed and
[1:40:00] that without remedy
[1:40:03] god is tenderhearted
[1:40:05] and he's full of mercy he as i said he's
[1:40:09] known to keep mercy for thousands he's
[1:40:12] kind he's kind and he has great
[1:40:15] affection for for his family for you and
[1:40:18] i friends and you you should rejoice in
[1:40:21] that
[1:40:22] rejoice in what god has done in our day
[1:40:25] because that when when we when we come
[1:40:28] back here to paul saying my little
[1:40:30] children of whom i travail in birth
[1:40:33] again until christ be formed in you
[1:40:36] and as i as i said to you this is a
[1:40:39] perfect example showing holy ghost
[1:40:42] development after your new birth brother
[1:40:44] branham makes this statement here's
[1:40:46] another quote i want to read
[1:40:48] in the unveiling of god
[1:40:50] now brother branham is in a discussion
[1:40:53] he's just given a testimony
[1:40:55] about speaking to a man who's
[1:40:56] challenging him on the baptism of the
[1:40:58] holy ghost it's a baptist preacher
[1:41:00] brother says a fine man and he's his
[1:41:03] whole
[1:41:04] premise is you know you're
[1:41:07] all you have to do is believe
[1:41:09] and and the moment you believe you're
[1:41:11] you're sealed in and brother branham
[1:41:13] brother branham is trying to say you
[1:41:15] know trying to show the man that you
[1:41:17] know then then then why does the bible
[1:41:19] talk about people who believed but then
[1:41:22] afterward we're filled with the holy
[1:41:23] ghost see
[1:41:25] and of course the man didn't want to
[1:41:26] talk and the man says hey no harm done
[1:41:28] brother m says no no no harm done at all
[1:41:30] sir god bless you you know you're
[1:41:32] welcome to believe that brother branham
[1:41:34] refers to peter
[1:41:37] and he says peter said
[1:41:39] that it was for everyone god would call
[1:41:41] for
[1:41:42] would receive the same apostolic
[1:41:45] blessing
[1:41:47] your privilege today to receive the same
[1:41:51] apostolic blessing
[1:41:52] the very same one peter received in that
[1:41:54] wonderful news
[1:41:56] he says now now watch
[1:41:59] now the natural veil
[1:42:02] god the word veiled in human flesh
[1:42:05] because brother branham has has talked
[1:42:07] about
[1:42:09] melchizedek
[1:42:10] and he's talked about moses and he he's
[1:42:13] got a he's got it talking about where
[1:42:15] moses failed god and they had to put a
[1:42:18] veil over his face and and we find that
[1:42:21] brother branham says now the natural
[1:42:22] veil god the word veiled in human flesh
[1:42:25] what was it
[1:42:26] god was veiled in moses
[1:42:29] amen
[1:42:30] god was in moses now watch because now
[1:42:33] i've went from melchizedek
[1:42:35] and now we're looking at moses
[1:42:37] he says now god was in moses
[1:42:40] veiled
[1:42:41] and the presence of god was in him he
[1:42:44] was so perfect with that word in him
[1:42:47] like that till he had to veil his face
[1:42:53] and it was a vindicated prophet
[1:42:57] that unfolded the word
[1:43:00] he's talking about how the word came in
[1:43:02] moses and then moses gave it out now as
[1:43:04] soon as the word went out of him he
[1:43:06] could take the veil off because his skin
[1:43:08] didn't shine anymore because the
[1:43:10] presence of god had went out of him see
[1:43:12] but it was showing the day when the holy
[1:43:14] ghost would come as a permanent resident
[1:43:17] inside you
[1:43:18] and then now you would be the word and
[1:43:20] that's why
[1:43:21] you know a lot of times young people say
[1:43:23] you know i wish my parents wouldn't say
[1:43:26] do this and don't do this but but but
[1:43:29] all you got to do is look back in the
[1:43:30] bible and brother branham says and it
[1:43:33] was vindicated prophet that unfolded the
[1:43:36] word this word inside of moses and then
[1:43:38] he started saying thou shalt thou shalt
[1:43:40] not thou shalt thou shalt not because
[1:43:43] that's what the word does the word comes
[1:43:45] to show you what you should do to
[1:43:47] receive life and what you shouldn't do
[1:43:49] to avoid death
[1:43:50] and that's the mercy of god that's not
[1:43:53] meant to be a legal code or a law that's
[1:43:56] god trying to help you
[1:43:58] trying to save you
[1:44:01] see
[1:44:03] sometimes i'm not sure we realize the
[1:44:07] potential
[1:44:08] of just how much of god's visible
[1:44:11] presence would be seen
[1:44:14] if if the veil of our flesh was a thin
[1:44:17] veneer
[1:44:18] if we could really get the veil of our
[1:44:21] flesh
[1:44:22] thinned out
[1:44:24] by dying out
[1:44:26] and be much less of you showing
[1:44:30] i wonder how much more of god's light
[1:44:32] could go through us
[1:44:34] to the world
[1:44:36] see
[1:44:37] just as it was
[1:44:39] with melchizedek this is the model for
[1:44:41] god's family going forward this is
[1:44:44] exactly what the holy ghost was given
[1:44:46] for and i'm not talking about when i say
[1:44:48] the holy ghost is given we're not
[1:44:49] talking about a mythic some mythical
[1:44:51] thing it's not a one-off it's not a it's
[1:44:53] not merely you know a a moment where you
[1:44:56] receive power for service and that's it
[1:44:59] now it is a moment of a new birth but
[1:45:03] it's not but it's not a pointless new
[1:45:06] birth
[1:45:06] see
[1:45:07] it's not an event
[1:45:10] without further purpose can i say it
[1:45:12] that way the new birth is in a moment
[1:45:14] but just like your body change will be
[1:45:16] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:45:18] you're not you don't gradually you know
[1:45:20] slowly become
[1:45:23] born three years later
[1:45:26] five years later
[1:45:28] again six years later nine years later
[1:45:31] again i'm born again
[1:45:35] you're born again
[1:45:37] the holy ghost comes upon your life
[1:45:39] brings a seed gene of god to life
[1:45:40] annihilates an old nature and you're a
[1:45:43] new creation in christ but it's not a
[1:45:45] one-off god's not just saying now you're
[1:45:48] a son of god see you on the other side
[1:45:50] you're it's a purpose-driven new birth
[1:45:54] and god has a great purpose in your life
[1:45:57] and it's and what is that purpose
[1:45:59] there's it's there's no greater purpose
[1:46:00] in the world it's to veil god you've
[1:46:04] literally become united with the creator
[1:46:08] of all things you've become the arm of
[1:46:10] the lord
[1:46:11] to the world
[1:46:16] jesus reproduced this on mount
[1:46:18] transfiguration and this would actually
[1:46:20] be the goal of every child of god
[1:46:22] to reach
[1:46:24] and so i come back again with my
[1:46:26] question
[1:46:28] how much of him could be seen
[1:46:30] if we would make this
[1:46:32] fallen flesh a thin veneer
[1:46:36] and get yourself
[1:46:38] out of the way
[1:46:40] through prayer and through
[1:46:43] dedication
[1:46:44] see
[1:46:45] and i i think as we grow in our in our
[1:46:48] spiritual written richness um this
[1:46:51] certainly should be the effect it's it's
[1:46:53] certainly a good indicator uh when we
[1:46:55] see that effect in our lives now and and
[1:46:58] hey it works in the opposite also
[1:47:01] because peter
[1:47:02] in ii peter speaking about people who
[1:47:05] are born again
[1:47:07] who had the same experience he had
[1:47:09] warned
[1:47:10] that if you don't grow in your spiritual
[1:47:13] maturity and you don't make your fallen
[1:47:15] flesh a thin veneer
[1:47:17] and you haven't added to faith virtue
[1:47:19] and virtue and you haven't developed and
[1:47:21] haven't haven't moved up in into
[1:47:24] spiritual maturity then you get like you
[1:47:26] get like a person you're not going to be
[1:47:28] unborn again because that you can't
[1:47:30] never go back from that
[1:47:32] because and that's what paul says
[1:47:34] because there's no way to to bring
[1:47:37] christ again you can't lose it because
[1:47:38] then he could never recover you see and
[1:47:40] so so but what peter did say is that you
[1:47:43] get blind and you can't see very far and
[1:47:45] you forget that you were delivered of
[1:47:46] those things
[1:47:48] and you live a life of carnality because
[1:47:50] the world has infected your mind and
[1:47:53] you've allowed that to take place yes
[1:47:56] you're a son of god yes you believe the
[1:47:57] word of god absolutely you want that but
[1:47:59] you seem to want to have one foot in the
[1:48:01] world and one foot in the word and
[1:48:03] that's a miserable life
[1:48:07] i'm here to tell you that's not what god
[1:48:09] designed for you when he gave you the
[1:48:11] baptism of the holy ghost he's desiring
[1:48:14] that it be the arm of the lord and
[1:48:15] you're the hand attached to the arm and
[1:48:17] you're the image of melchizedek you're
[1:48:19] what moses was showing you're what mount
[1:48:21] transfiguration was all about
[1:48:24] see
[1:48:26] and so this is the this is the example
[1:48:29] that we that we walk by see
[1:48:33] say
[1:48:36] how do i get there
[1:48:38] brother jason
[1:48:41] you you get there
[1:48:42] first of all
[1:48:44] by realizing you're on a journey to get
[1:48:46] there
[1:48:48] and that god
[1:48:49] the same one who saved you
[1:48:51] has been loving you for a long time
[1:48:54] and came and and and found you i mean if
[1:48:56] you if you look at jacob jacob's one of
[1:48:59] my favorite people
[1:49:01] in the bible to study
[1:49:02] and one certainly
[1:49:04] in my top three or four
[1:49:06] and brother brahm would say now
[1:49:10] he said for jacob i mean for abraham and
[1:49:13] isaac i mean you can kind of get it
[1:49:16] but for jacob
[1:49:17] boy you're going to really have to
[1:49:19] believe in the grace of god
[1:49:23] and yet he was in the lineage of christ
[1:49:26] he said you're really going to have to
[1:49:28] lean hard into love and mercy and god's
[1:49:31] sovereign will
[1:49:32] you know he
[1:49:34] he
[1:49:35] jacob
[1:49:36] he comes to that that final trial and
[1:49:38] i'm just going to cut to the chase he
[1:49:40] comes to that final trial
[1:49:42] and he
[1:49:44] he's in a time of darkness he's in a
[1:49:46] time of desperation and desperation is
[1:49:48] often a very dark time
[1:49:50] and jacob has ran now he met god he made
[1:49:52] a vow to god and now he's been 20 years
[1:49:56] you know just just meandering through
[1:49:59] life
[1:50:00] not realizing god sees
[1:50:02] a dark night waiting for him
[1:50:05] and god knows he'll catch him
[1:50:08] and god brings him to this to this
[1:50:11] darkness and there's where he wrestled
[1:50:13] with the angel of the lord and brother
[1:50:15] brown talks about that extensively how
[1:50:17] he had to wrestle it out can't we
[1:50:19] friends can't we relate to that that
[1:50:21] that time i just had to wrestle it out
[1:50:23] that time i just had to get a hold of
[1:50:24] god and i said i'm tired of trying i'm
[1:50:26] tired of running i'm tired and i've said
[1:50:28] i've said many times that by the time
[1:50:31] jacob got to that dark night jacob was
[1:50:33] so done with being jacob i got to that
[1:50:36] point i was so done with being me i
[1:50:38] didn't want to be me anymore i met
[1:50:40] somebody like chris that was christ and
[1:50:42] i said i want to be like him
[1:50:44] hallelujah how can anyone meet christ
[1:50:47] and want to be themselves i don't i
[1:50:49] don't want to be me anymore once i met
[1:50:50] him i wanted to be him i wanted me to
[1:50:53] die out i wanted that dark night i
[1:50:55] wanted to survive it
[1:50:57] and that's what jacob did jacob
[1:50:59] outlasted that darkness
[1:51:03] oh i love that line and that song sister
[1:51:05] emily cobb's song that you know about
[1:51:07] outlasting this darkness and i just
[1:51:09] thought every time i hear her sing that
[1:51:11] line on our on our archive i i just put
[1:51:14] up my hands and i say i outlasted the
[1:51:16] darkness
[1:51:18] and i'm going to outlast this world i'm
[1:51:20] going to outlast satan's eden i'm not
[1:51:22] going down i'm going up
[1:51:24] hallelujah i'm going to outlast this
[1:51:27] darkness it's not going to get me how
[1:51:29] many want to have that claim today and
[1:51:31] say i'm marching to zion and nothing is
[1:51:34] going to stop me
[1:51:36] hallelujah
[1:51:38] [Applause]
[1:51:40] he became a prince he became israel he
[1:51:43] became a prince
[1:51:45] and we find that that he says here
[1:51:49] he brother branham talks about in the
[1:51:51] reproach for the word
[1:51:53] see
[1:51:55] once jacob came to that position he
[1:51:57] could never fall back from it
[1:52:01] say
[1:52:04] how is that even possible
[1:52:07] turns out that
[1:52:09] everything
[1:52:10] that happened to him
[1:52:13] when he was jacob
[1:52:17] all that stuff we read and go wow that
[1:52:19] guy
[1:52:21] everything
[1:52:23] that
[1:52:24] that that happened to him
[1:52:26] when he was jacob
[1:52:29] god was using to build him
[1:52:33] into israel
[1:52:36] you say but man some of those things
[1:52:37] some of those things in my life are
[1:52:39] pretty dismal failures i i wish i would
[1:52:41] have avoided them i'm sure god wished
[1:52:43] you would avoid them too but i'm here to
[1:52:44] tell you god still uses them
[1:52:47] god god doesn't leave anything god uses
[1:52:50] moments as teachable moments and brother
[1:52:52] ram said you can go off into his
[1:52:53] permissive will it's okay he'll bring
[1:52:56] you back and the road is a long road to
[1:52:59] ho you might not like the journey back
[1:53:01] but on the journey you are
[1:53:03] amen how many have been thankful for the
[1:53:05] journey
[1:53:06] and i've went off but he brought me back
[1:53:09] and i got the stripes to prove it
[1:53:12] and every one of them i say thank god
[1:53:15] amen
[1:53:18] brother branham starts talking about in
[1:53:19] reproach for the word
[1:53:22] now this is familiar to you i don't
[1:53:23] really have to read it all and i'm
[1:53:25] getting ready to close i i know i'm a
[1:53:27] little bit of overtime you okay let me
[1:53:28] just have another 15 minutes
[1:53:33] brother brown says i was preaching not
[1:53:34] long ago and a little boy out on the
[1:53:35] ship you know the story an old captain
[1:53:37] was dying he was sick
[1:53:39] and he said is there a bible on board
[1:53:40] and they caught a little boy that had a
[1:53:42] bible and coming and he come and read
[1:53:44] isaiah 53 5 he was wounded for our
[1:53:47] transgressions bruised for iniquities
[1:53:49] and he said
[1:53:50] he said let let let me tell you captain
[1:53:54] he said how my mother used to read it
[1:53:57] because it wasn't really having much
[1:53:58] effect on the captain
[1:54:00] here he was reading him the scripture in
[1:54:02] isaiah 53 but it wasn't having its
[1:54:03] desired effect and he said captain let
[1:54:06] me read it to you the way mama used to
[1:54:08] read it to me
[1:54:10] he says how that my mother used to read
[1:54:12] it said here's the way she wrote it he
[1:54:15] was wounded
[1:54:16] for willy pruitt's iniquity
[1:54:19] he was chastised for willy pruitt
[1:54:22] and all these things that he done
[1:54:25] was for willy pruitt because that was
[1:54:26] his name he put his own name there
[1:54:29] and the old captain said i like that
[1:54:32] could you read my name in it
[1:54:34] and he said i'll try
[1:54:36] and he says
[1:54:38] he was wounded for john quartz
[1:54:40] transgressions
[1:54:42] he was bruised for john quartz iniquity
[1:54:46] and with his stripes john quartz was
[1:54:48] healed and he said i see it and the lord
[1:54:52] healed him see and brother branham says
[1:54:55] read your name in it he was wounded for
[1:54:58] william branham's transgressions he was
[1:55:00] bruised for william branham's iniquity
[1:55:02] he did that for me he did that for you
[1:55:05] read your name into it oh keep keep keep
[1:55:10] growing you know i i i that's what jacob
[1:55:13] had to do jacob had to keep growing he
[1:55:15] had to keep going he he
[1:55:18] it's like it's like he did jacob it's
[1:55:20] like you did me it's like he did you can
[1:55:22] you find the courage to put your name in
[1:55:25] there and and i had to come to that day
[1:55:28] just like you did moses just like you
[1:55:29] did abraham just like you did for jason
[1:55:32] watkins he was wounded for jason watkins
[1:55:35] he was bruised can you put your name in
[1:55:37] that in that verse today
[1:55:41] can you can you find the courage
[1:55:44] just like
[1:55:46] john quartz did
[1:55:48] that even in my failures
[1:55:53] my repentance grows me
[1:55:56] that is a mind-blowing
[1:55:59] truth
[1:56:00] that even in my failures
[1:56:03] my repentance
[1:56:05] grows me
[1:56:07] this is such a beautiful plan of god no
[1:56:10] wonder he could say i'll not lose a one
[1:56:14] they're in my father's hand no one can
[1:56:16] pluck them out i will chastise them with
[1:56:19] many stripes but i will bring them back
[1:56:22] to the fold hallelujah oh that's the
[1:56:25] love of god friends that's what god even
[1:56:28] even
[1:56:29] you know i i read i read somewhere where
[1:56:32] we talk about you know my life here my
[1:56:33] life there my life this my life that and
[1:56:36] finally i came to know the lord well you
[1:56:38] understand that even in that darkness
[1:56:40] even in that time god that's what i
[1:56:42] found out i went a long time until i
[1:56:45] find out i was being followed
[1:56:47] and i turned around and somebody was
[1:56:49] following me and somebody started
[1:56:50] speaking to me and in my life of sin i
[1:56:52] kept hearing a voice adam adam where art
[1:56:55] thou had him i kept hearing a voice
[1:56:57] jacob jacob where art thou jacob i kept
[1:57:00] hearing a voice jason jason where are
[1:57:02] you son where are you son and finally
[1:57:04] one day i surrendered
[1:57:06] and i found out he was always following
[1:57:09] me he always had a plan for me i was
[1:57:12] never outside of his care
[1:57:16] oh my i was in a dark night just like
[1:57:19] jacob because i was born in darkness
[1:57:22] i was born in a body of sin i live in a
[1:57:25] world spiritually dark but oh for that
[1:57:29] morning
[1:57:30] for that morning i'm telling you i will
[1:57:32] outlast this darkness i will be eternal
[1:57:36] now i have to outlast it because this
[1:57:38] darkness is not eternal and i am eternal
[1:57:42] and so i will outlast the darkness
[1:57:46] hallelujah
[1:57:48] the bible imagery of melchizedek the
[1:57:50] bible imagery of moses
[1:57:53] they both show
[1:57:56] that i veil
[1:57:59] a great light
[1:58:04] you might have a hard time
[1:58:06] believing that for you
[1:58:09] your life might be in a place where you
[1:58:11] just say
[1:58:13] i would love it but there's no way i can
[1:58:15] get there
[1:58:17] impossible
[1:58:19] i'm sorry preacher
[1:58:20] it's impossible
[1:58:23] but yet
[1:58:25] there it is in jacob
[1:58:27] and i would just say to you today it was
[1:58:29] impossible for him too
[1:58:31] there it was in jacob and even when
[1:58:34] jacob was walking in his own will
[1:58:37] he still on that great morning he still
[1:58:40] became israel
[1:58:42] a prince
[1:58:45] say how is that possible because the
[1:58:47] bible says
[1:58:48] jacob have i loved
[1:58:51] he loved him even when he was jacob
[1:58:54] he loved me even when i was in darkness
[1:58:56] jacob have i loved there was never a
[1:58:58] time god didn't love him that's how he
[1:59:00] out that's how he outlasts darkness
[1:59:02] that's how when the sun rose that next
[1:59:04] morning
[1:59:06] jacob was gone
[1:59:07] and a prince
[1:59:09] israel a shyster to a prince
[1:59:13] overnight
[1:59:14] because he wrestled it out with the
[1:59:16] angel
[1:59:18] oh my
[1:59:21] the nighttime of this world is
[1:59:23] everywhere friends
[1:59:25] but morning
[1:59:27] is breaking
[1:59:29] the bible says to us arise
[1:59:32] shine
[1:59:33] thy light
[1:59:35] is
[1:59:36] come
[1:59:38] let's stand let's stand
[1:59:43] arise
[1:59:44] shine
[1:59:46] thy light
[1:59:47] is come
[1:59:50] brother branham
[1:59:53] closing in his message on
[1:59:56] who is this melchizedek he said you
[1:59:58] become from the attribute to the flesh
[2:00:00] to be tempted i love this line
[2:00:03] but when this life is finished here
[2:00:09] my
[2:00:11] on that morning friends brother branham
[2:00:14] says when that spirit
[2:00:16] lives in you
[2:00:17] it brings your whole body subject to
[2:00:20] that spirit and when the bible says
[2:00:22] don't do this that body quickly turns to
[2:00:25] that there's no question see now
[2:00:28] i i remember
[2:00:30] recently
[2:00:31] covering this to say
[2:00:35] the evidence
[2:00:37] one evidence of the holy ghost is that
[2:00:39] it brings your body subject to the word
[2:00:41] to every word amen
[2:00:44] but now let's just be real for a moment
[2:00:47] [Music]
[2:00:49] because there's times when
[2:00:51] my body isn't subject to the word
[2:00:54] and you have the same problem don't we
[2:00:58] so you know what we do
[2:01:00] we obey another part of the word
[2:01:02] because i failed
[2:01:04] at this part of the word i go over here
[2:01:06] and find me another word
[2:01:08] that says if we repent and commit it and
[2:01:11] confess our sins he's faithful and just
[2:01:13] to forgive
[2:01:16] say but but i failed over here yeah but
[2:01:18] you met it over here
[2:01:20] and the beauty say well then i'm 50 50
[2:01:23] no no you're 100 you know why because
[2:01:26] the obedience of this one
[2:01:28] means that the offense of this one never
[2:01:30] occurred
[2:01:32] it's as though you never did it in the
[2:01:36] first place
[2:01:38] hallelujah friends that's what the blood
[2:01:40] of the lamb is for that's what the holy
[2:01:42] ghost is given for that's the ability it
[2:01:46] has
[2:01:47] in our life
[2:01:49] and that's why i love it when brother
[2:01:50] branham
[2:01:52] he says
[2:01:53] when this life
[2:01:55] is finished
[2:01:57] when this life is finished here friends
[2:01:59] you say oh my that word that i obeyed
[2:02:02] that's how powerful the blood of christ
[2:02:05] is
[2:02:05] repentance
[2:02:07] of your failure
[2:02:09] is so powerful
[2:02:11] it literally takes the offense
[2:02:14] and makes it as if it never happened in
[2:02:17] the first place
[2:02:19] when this life is finished
[2:02:22] i'll be free
[2:02:23] [Music]
[2:02:24] the devil will never get me
[2:02:27] i love telling him that you will never
[2:02:30] get me you'll never get me i've already
[2:02:33] passed from death and to life i can
[2:02:35] never come into the judgment i've
[2:02:37] already survived the long night i woke
[2:02:40] up one morning and i was a prince
[2:02:42] hallelujah friends that's the love of
[2:02:44] god that's the god whose throne is
[2:02:47] established in mercy is that the god you
[2:02:50] serve today is that the god who's real

[2:02:54] of god who's following you that's the
[2:02:56] kind of god who's talking to you that's
