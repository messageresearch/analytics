TRANSCRIPT
========================================
gracious Heavenly Father we come before you Lord and we ask that your Holy Spirit would just take control of the Sunday school this morning I pray Lord that you'd take your word and write it upon our hearts father we commit ourselves and Commit This Time To You For Your Glory we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you can be seated we're going to continue with the subject of the truth about our future home it's part five if you want to bring up the PowerPoint for me first scripture we're going to look at is in Psalms 37:1 and read that but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall Delight themselves in the abundance of Peace the truth is that an unearthly Heaven is not our future home but Heaven and Earth United together again will be our future home we are destined predestined to inherit this Earth God created the Earth he put us on it to have dominion over it this was his original plan original intention Satan came in mixed himself this is where the Plan of Redemption comes but the the plan has not changed it's just the plan has become restoration back to the original in a multiplied form with God's attributes fully on display God intends to show his glory on this very planet Earth he plans on redeeming it completely brother brandom says in future home no beasts will be there to destroy you again when you walk down the road in the flower gardens there will not be any serpent there to hiss at you and bite you with his poison Venom oh my won't it be wonderful listen there will be none of that new Earth ever mounted up to a little yellow sod bank for a grave be none of them there man and God Has Come Together bride and bridegroom Heaven and Earth heavens and earth embraced each other God has come down to dwell among men his Tabernacle is with them there will be no more sin no more sorrow never will there ever be a tear drop off of a mother's cheek over her baby amen it won't be on that new ground no it's redeemed it belongs to him and for his that was redeemed out of it see and look you are a part of that ground is that right and when he redeemed you he redeemed the earth and the same thing and you are together again oh how much pler can it be see you have to be redeemed cuz you're a part of it and if the blood didn't drop on you you ain't redeemed yet you're not called then he cleanses it that's the same thing he does in the fire even the blood blood dropped it's yet got to be cleansed by fire that's right for a dwelling place for God go God already took up his AB potentially the kingdom of God is in the earth now in the hearts of his Saints it's his attributes that he begin in the beginning now his attributes is redeemed what's he what's he waiting to redeem the Earth to set his attributes on it to fulfill exactly he's predestinated plan do you see it all right so we see there it's it's clear Redemption is for this Earth our bodies but it's also for it's not just for the inside of us and that's the thing where so many people get it confused and muddled up within the Christian realm as we talked at the end of last time is this philosophy of Plato and Aristotle comes in where spiritual is good and and physical is bad but that's not what God Said in the beginning did God when he created Adam and Eve in the in a body of Flesh what did he say that was bad no he said it was very good right so this is important to understand is that the physical the heaven is not merely a spiritual place like we think of it God is a spirit he covers all space and time we can't touch him we can't see him no it's you're not going to be like that and Heaven is not going to be like that and that's the problem is that concept has permeated so much in our culture and around the world that heaven is an unearthly spiritual place and even brother brandham was stumbled by that so bad and it took the Lord really dealing with him supernaturally to get it out of his mind it's a it's a place where it's physical it's real you can touch it heaven heaven is not unearthly it's not a cloud it's just as real it's more real than what you are here today amen and so the Earth is the place that God created for his glory to be seen on again because of sin that's separate separated but God's purpose is to bring it back together again and we're going to look at some scriptures Ezekiel 43:2 and behold the glory of the god of Israel came from the way of the East and his voice was like a noise of many Waters and the Earth shined with his glory god is going to create this Earth so that it shines with his glory Psalms 859 surely his salvation is nigh them that fear Him That Glory May dwell in our land god wants glory to dwell in the land of his people Psalm 24:1 the Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein it all belongs to God and God is not going to go he's not going to let Satan win right he's not going to let Satan win and say you know what you corrupted this thing and I just give up I'm going to start all over again he he never does that that's not God that's not in that's not in God's mind that's not in his plan that's not how he works that's not how he operates he takes that which belonged to him that was lost and fixes it he repairs it he restores it Revelation 11:15 and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever this hasn't happened yet but it's going to happen the governments of this world are going to change who who their allegiance is to it's going to be transferred when Christ and the Saints return back to this earth will take over every government of the world second Peter 3 and of course you know this is the part of the text that brother brandham took for the future home and we'll talk about it whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved under Fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but his longsuffering to usw not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and Hasting under the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness all right so this is where many people take they take these verses and they say God's going to destroy the Earth the entire Earth Heaven everything completely dissolve it and then he's going to recreate a new heavens and a new Earth but remember what Peter starts with at the very beginning the world that then was he's using past judgment to tell us and give us an understanding of future judgment the world that then was so what is a what is the world that then was the world order the Earth structure is there it completely changed the geology of the earth totally changed because of the flood but the structure of the earth is the exact same earth right it just changed from one form to another right well that's the same thing the elements melting with a fervent heat things being dissolved does not mean that God totally destroys his entire creation and does red does a six- day creation or something to that effect that idea no what it is is this Earth this Earth is held in judgment is there and and this Earth these elements will melt with fervent Heat and it speaks of uh grab that word it says where it will pass away brother Bram says it means it's changing from one form to another it's not go out of EX existence but to be changed from old to new it's the same word and same terminology that's used of the new birth amen uh Matthew 19 27 then answered Peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken all and followed thee what shall we have therefore and Jesus said unto them verily I say unto you that ye which have followed me in the Regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the Throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel so this is referring to the Millennium the millennial Reign and now we're talking about our future home we went through that whole picture the the Millennium isn't the restoration of the new heavens and the new Earth right that comes after the Millennium nevertheless as you'll find this in scripture when when when we're talking about our future home and even brother brandham does this the Millennium and the new Earth begins to blend together why does it do this why do they do that why do the writers of the Bible why does brother brandham do that I believe it's this here because the Millennium is a regeneration of the earth there's a there's a process we understand also that that just as the fire burnt up Sodom the fire will burn up this present age when when when the leodan age finishes the tribulation sets in at the end of that comes the day of the Lord and that is where there's a fire that comes that's one fire that but there's another fire that will come at the end of the Millennium when Satan is loosed for a little season and gathers together the people to fight against the the lamb and the Saints then the fire comes from Heaven again so and even Peter goes back and forth between that the coming of the day of God that's not the end of the Millennium that's the end of the tribulation period but he jumps directly then to the new heavens and the new Earth so you see what I'm saying when when we talk about this there is a blending the Bible talks of it distinctly brother brandham talks about it distinctly and the Bible talks about it separately uh uh uh in a United Way so it talks it both both directions so the Regeneration is what's happening what when Christ and the Saints come back to earth things will be slowly set back into order just like when you and I are regenerated the fire of the Holy Ghost brother Bram talks about the fire of the Holy Ghost is like the baptism of the Holy Ghost see the fire comes and then what are we we're we're not a finished product when we get the Holy Ghost there's a process that takes place we're transformed from glory to glory adding word on top of word so the Millennium does that and then that that comes to then the new heavens and the new Earth and there's a lot there and you can go completely go to seed when you look at types yeah and there's always a danger of that when you do that so you have to be careful how far you want to take it because you look at a type and you start creating a new doctrine because you're looking at a type and that's that's the danger that you have to be careful about types types confirm the doctrine that's there types don't make the doctrine uh Revelation 215 and I think probably many of our problems around the message over the history of the last how many ever years have come because people have taken a type and tried to fit it over the top of a clear simple basic doctrine of the Bible Revelation 215 and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things knew and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful again easy to take this and say he must destroy it all completely no atoms left and he recre recreates at the atomic level completely no look at what Redemption is he went to the Cross to make all things new right and he started that process I go to my father's house I prepare prepare a place for you etc etc so the process started at the cross what what is he doing renewing making all things new is the exactly the same way of saying regenerating renewing bringing it from Death To Life Revelation 211 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea again same same terminology going from one form to another passing from one form to another from Death to life all right let's look at some of the Old Testament promises Psalms 10215 so the Heathen shall fear the name of the Lord and all the kings of the earth thy Glory so every nation is going to come under the Dominion of Christ amen Psalm 10216 when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory so he's going to appear in his glory and he's going to reveal himself to the kings of the Earth to the Heathen think about that you could say well that's that's me that's us that's the Gentiles yes that's true but remember he reveals himself first the son of man in spirit formed to who first to the he revealed him before in flesh form to the Jews he reveals it in spirit form form to the Gentiles then when the Gentiles are taken up what does he do he reveals himself in spirit form to the Jews through the two two witnesses amen right but then he's going to come and he's going to reveal himself to the whole earth to all the heathens to all the nations his he shall appear in his glory and bring destruction to the world so that's that's coming he's going to reveal himself on Earth here to the Heathen amen Hallelujah I want to be with him I don't want to be here cuz his Revelation then if you're here then it's it's a problem all right Isaiah 11 familiar scriptures of course again this is this is speaking about the Millennium but again it's it's giving the picture an understanding that this is a restoration of the earth it's part of the process the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the Le shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the Young Lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them and the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox and the suckling child shall play on the hole of the ASP and the wean child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain for the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters come cover the Sea The Curse is lifted there's no longer now you put a calf together with a lion the lion has supper right but in in that the curse is lifted it's not supper anymore they're they're eating together they're playing together and it even of course it's a millennial scene it's speaking of little children and so forth wean children and nursing children and so on you know this is this is not the new Heaven and the new Earth but it is the start of the release of the curse that's finished in the new Heaven and the new Earth amen Isaiah 65:17 for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind right so here he is once again taking it from one form to another and and even if you look at this verse the word create there's two tenses in Hebrew one is a finished process and one is a a pro a work in process and this this the tense of this word create is the process so he says for behold I am creating new heavens and the new Earth and then it goes on to describe the Millennium right brother Bram says this is referring to the Millennium so the Millennium is a part of the recreation process Revelation 21:25 and the gates of it shall not be shut At All by day for there shall be no night there 26 and they shall bring the glory and honor of the Nations into it all right we're going to we're looking at that but I want you to know that this is an Old Testament prophecy it's in Isaiah 60 brother brandham in Christ is the mystery of God revealed says now notice again now what's his three-fold purpose manifest itself in Jesus Christ to come into the body by Jesus Christ to have the preeminence to what restore Back to Eden bring back to that which was lost that was the only thing out of order all the rest of his things was in order so the three-fold purpose manifest himself in Jesus Christ come into the body by Jesus Christ to have preeminence and to restore it back to Eden so three parts of that purpose the Millennium is that start of that process the new heavens and the new Earth is the completion of that process that's what we're coming to restoring Eden again all right so Isaiah 6011 therefore thy Gates shall be open continually they shall not be shut day nor night that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles and that their kings may be brought for the nation and Kingdom that will not serve thee Shall Perish ye those Nations shall be utterly wasted the glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee the fur tree the pine tree and the box together to beautify the place of my sanctuary and I will make the place of my feet glorious the sons also of them that Afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee and all they that despise thee shall bow themselves down at the souls of thy feet and they shall call Thee the city of the Lord the Zion of the Holy One of Israel whereas thou has been Forsaken and hated so that no man went through Thee I will make thee an eternal Excellency a joy of many generations Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles and shalt suck the breast of Kings Thou shalt know that I the Lord am thy Savior and thy Redeemer the mighty one of Jacob for brass I will bring gold and for iron I will bring silver and for wood brass and for Stones iron I will also make thy off officers peace and thy exactor's righteousness violence shall no nor no more be heard in thy land wasting nor destruction within thy borders but Thou shalt call thy walls salvation and thy Gates praise the sun shall be no more light thy light by day neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light light and thy God thy Glory thy son shall no more go down neither shall thy Moon withdraw itself for the Lord shall be the thine Everlasting Light and the days of thy morning morning shall be ended thy people also shall be all righteous they shall inherit the land forever the branch of my planting the work of my hands that I may be glorified again these verse from this these verses are put forward in Revelation speaking of the new heaven new heavens and the new Earth quite an Earthly scene this is not a picture of living off in outer space on a cloud this is I mean look at it ships silver gold Kings flocks Rams camels fur trees pine trees that's Heaven it's clear that this Earth is our Eternal destination a perfect Earth I want you to think of all the great things that you enjoy and and I I especially I wish I wish the young people I see a few young people are with me but I feel like this is so important when I was a kid the thought of Heaven Was terrifying because it sounded so incredibly boring in my idea it was of course I was a Lutheran so church was boring we're sitting there you're sitting there you're going through and you're doing um you're you're reading off something in responsive reading and the minister gets up he's not even interested in what he's talking about so your idea about worship and Heaven is so perverted and clouded that there's no way to understand these things correctly so what why would you long for heaven why would you desire Heaven as a young person and that's that's wrong there's a I mean it's a place of Joy rejoicing our services church services should be a place of joy and rejoicing as well but that is going to be a reflection of that because we we we love God and we love his presence and it's it's a a you know think think of the things that you enjoy cuz it's not going to be just a worship service for all of eternity though that's wonderful and there will be enormous amounts of that continuous amounts of that but the things that you enjoy now they'll never end hiking art painting carpentry poetry writing reading music mountains camping cabins family vacations Sports Etc you say sports not the modern worldly Sports there'll be something on a different totally different level we love enjoy and and enjoy moving our bodies and we get as you get older you get more and more limited in that right but you'll be the full Vibrance of Youth in that body and you'll be enjoying things uh you you say oh I like soccer I like baseball I like this there be things like that only so much better so much more enjoyable and not in a competition of anger and frustration with one another see this is so important to understand these things especially I believe for the young people a perfect Earth is our Eternal destination and it's a place of unbelievable Joy I mean think about the the times you're traveling or or some of people people hate travel so I'll just think about the times you're at home in your backyard in your garden or the rest of us who like to travel think about the times you're seeing some incredible amazing place whether it be the ocean that doesn't have to now it has to end we got to go back to work we got to go back to our responsibilities that will never end that will never stop that joy that that sense of connection with God and His creation that will never end there's nothing to Cloud there's nothing to destroy that whatsoever being holy is not being a monk sedentary stuck in a Cell someplace that's not what it is and you know if we we present that idea that the only way to the only way to pray and the only way to be holy is just to be stuck in some little boring cell and and that's that's not God's idea that's not God's heart all of those things of course getting on your knees and praying now brother brand says that's the true expression of manhood is wearing out the floor and wearing out your the knees of your pants in prayer but that he didn't say that was the only expression and the only way see look at brother brandom himself how much he loved being in in nature and in the wilderness and connecting with the Lord out there that will that is that is the reality of what heaven is going to be like am nothing to hinder no devil to hinder you from your fellowship out in the woods or on the top of a mountain and you could just you'll be able to just by thought be on the top of a mountain or if you don't want to you'll be able to run as fast as you can up that mountain I mean you you think about the things that that are expressed in in those verses and in a number of other verses is you know there's there's farming in heaven some people love farming they think that's the absolute greatest thing and they they maybe they maybe they dreamt of being a farmer well maybe that dream is going to be fulfilled over there because they be beat their swords into plowshares plow Shares are used for farming in case you'd ever wondered so there's work and there's there's there's work that's horrible and there's work that we love and enjoy and that's the kind of work that's going to be over there I want you I want you to understand something uh in closing God made you the way that you are to enjoy what you enjoy and it's not a mistake you don't have to be like somebody else so this this teaching applies here but it also applies over there he made you in a certain way and sometimes sometimes he calls you to something and you have to surrender everything to the Lord and it becomes you feel now like it's a sacrifice because you're so bound to time I wish I could do this I have it in my heart to do this and you can never quite get there I believe that there you'll get to that because here is just a fleeting passing moment there it it's unending hard for us to comprehend on the new Earth you'll be the very same person with the same gifts the same likes the same things that you enjoy but you'll be free to pursue exactly what God designed you to pursue without the hindrance of sin and time amen let's stand and pray heavenly father thank you so much for all the good things that you've given to us Lord even even now Lord you made us in the bodies that we're in Lord with lungs with the heart with the ability to run and leap and dance and laugh and all those different things that you've created us to be Lord and you've you've created us to desire to enjoy life Lord and the true path of enjoyment is a full surrender to you father because knowing that this is just temporary the things that we're going through the suffering and the trials that we Face they're just temporary and and in in surrendering and offering ourselves up completely to you there lies a reward at the end Lord a perfect body on a perfect Earth with a perfect life Lord to joy and be the person you created us to be for your glory Lord radiating your very Glory your attributes yourself on display Lord we commit ourselves to you Lord we ask that you be with us ask that you'd be glorified in our worship and in the word that would go forth we commit ourselves to you in Jesus name amen
