Amen. God bless you. We greet you in the name of the Lord this morning. We're going to invite you right to our opening text in 1 Timothy chapter 6. Happy to have you all in the house of God today on this chilly, rainy day. Amen. I think next week we're supposed to be back to 70, so go figure. Amen. I tell people all the time when they ask me, "Do y'all have any winter?" I say, "Well, we do, but it's usually gone by noon." So, but u maybe [clears throat] we we might get a little bit this year. I don't know. That doesn't seem so. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Sure enjoyed all the singing and wonderful uh ministering this morning in the Sunday school. I was uh never cease to be amazed how conducive it is to what I have on my heart as well. Just just shows the that it's all drawing from a single source. Amen. Praise the Lord. Um we want to look here at 1 Timothy chapter 6 and we're going to read verses 3 through 12. This will be my fourth installment um in my series on demonology, the spiritual realm. [cough] Amen. [clears throat] 1 Timothy chapter 6 verse three. You got it? Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is proud, knowing nothing, but doing about questions and strives of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings. So [clears throat] you can see that for you know for people to try to find an end around on the word of God is not a Leodysian problem. It's all the way back from the beginning. Uh the very earliest days in the church Paul was having to write and dis and talk about people who when it came to godliness were always trying to figure out a way around that. And Paul is just simply, you know, putting it on the brass tax as they say. Uh he's proud knowing nothing but doing about questions and strives of words. See, everybody's got an opinion, right? Whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, and evil surmising. So if you want to destroy the unity of any church, just let there beginning begin to be strife over godliness and the ministry trying to stand for it and the people trying to resist it and find ways around it and skirt the lines and walk near the edge and these kind. You say, "Well, okay, so we destroy a little bit of unity." That's the power. &gt;&gt; That's how the power works. You destroy the unity, you effectively are Satan's agent to hinder the power of God. &gt;&gt; See [clears throat] verse five. Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness, from such withdraw thyself. But godliness with contentment [clears throat] is great gain. For we wrought nothing into brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and raignment, let us there be therewith content. But they [clears throat] that will be rich fall into temp into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lust, which drown men in destruction and predition. [clears throat] Now, let me make it clear. Paul is not saying that a rich man is a sinner. He's not even He's not even really talking about possessing or not possessing great wealth. He's talking about the pursuit of it &gt;&gt; by the world's standards. &gt;&gt; You understand? So God blesses who he blesses. But however God blesses you, be there with content and don't chase it. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, because Paul is saying when when you do that, when you start chasing it for the sake of being rich, he goes in the next in the very next verse, uh, for for the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some coveted, they have aired from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. So this now [clears throat] this this goes across the pursuit of money, the pursuit of fame, any type of fortune and glory, any type of advantageous position that you want to try to achieve to in in the world using the world's ways to get there. Paul is simply talking about your desire. There's a problem in your desire. Not that whether you have more zeros in the bank than the next guy, but what is in your heart and what are you chasing and what are you doing to achieve it? &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is not a lessian problem. This is a Christianity problem that the apostles were dealing with back in the day. [clears throat] And he just simply says the people who do that, he didn't even say they're they're not, you know, they lose their salvation. He's just simply saying they pierce themselves through with many sorrows. See, and and there's [clears throat] no sorrow worse than seeing that kind of a habit fall into your children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; After you've long fixed it and you're not like that anymore, then seeing your children struggle with that and you realize, h see, that's a that you're talking about a dagger to the heart. All right. [clears throat] But thou, oh man of God, flee these things. That's an active word. And follow after. Catch it now. Flee from one and follow after another. Flee these things and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness, and fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold on eternal life, where to thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses. Let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word today. Thank you for this group of people gathered here. I ask now, Lord, that you give me the right mental frame of mind to to take this Lord in an expository way and uh that's uh that requires mental discipline. So, I'm asking for your mercy today as we try to bring Lord these truths that concerned the heart of your great apostle. And Lord, it wasn't just Paul. We're going to read the quotes and statements of others of thy great apostles and prophets and sages. So Lord, help us today. I pray in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. So I don't know whether you know you expected a subject called demonology to deal with practical everyday living. Uh you know but um I'm not here to train you in the occult. That's not demonology. That's not the way Brother Brandham preached demonology and he used it just to expose the devil. But then he that became a platform for building up your awareness that the enemy is lurking at all times. &gt;&gt; He's always after you. &gt;&gt; He He desires 247 to destroy you. &gt;&gt; And so now we're we're supposed to know our enemy. So Brother Ram said, "Know him." See, so this is what we're doing today in this expository lesson. And in fact is in the better part of this series. We're showing you the practical steps. I don't want to put us into the aal. I want us to take the practical steps. How do I defeat Satan and stay victorious in my life as a Christian? &gt;&gt; That should be the number one goal. That's why, you know, I I probably shocked you a little bit on uh I didn't say it for shock value. Uh I said it because I felt inspired to ask it when I was studying and I think it was Wednesday night at the communion service. I said you need to decide and and I don't need you to wait raise your hand or you know or or you know get in a certain line or identify yourself. I just need you to answer it to yourself. Are you a real Christian or merely a message believer? &gt;&gt; Amen. because those are not necessarily, you understand, they're they're not now they're they're they're not mutually exclusive. Both can be true at the same time. I am a message believer because I'm a real Christian. &gt;&gt; And the fact that I'm a real Christian causes me to believe the message. But there are there are many who sit in message churches, and I maybe shouldn't use the word many. Let me use a more faith than that. There are some and they know I'm sure at least I hope they know if you don't know who you are. Hopefully the word can identify you today to yourself to help you. &gt;&gt; Not to insult you, but to help you. I need help. &gt;&gt; Y'all need help. &gt;&gt; See, that's what the word is here for. We need help. &gt;&gt; And so I I want the word to show me that I'm that I'm NOT JUST I NOT JUST THAT I believe that God sent a prophet because the devil believes that. Not that I disbelieve in God because the devil believes that. Not that I just believe the doctrines because I can prove them in the Bible. But not merely because I can prove them in the BIBLE BUT BECAUSE THEY are a living element that lives inside me and walk THROUGH ME AND I KNOW WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED. &gt;&gt; I know BY EXPERIENCE. THIS IS WHAT JOHN SAID THAT you can know. YOU CAN ACTUALLY know that you can actually know not by mere persuasion. You can know by a living life experience that's a revelation of faith that it is the truth and that Christ is the power uh in the world. And so so this is what we're looking at uh when we look at this whole thing of practical lifestyles. Paul is saying to us, fight the good fight. SO ALL OF THESE ALL OF THESE ACTIVE WORDS, THEY'RE NOT PASSIVE. Flee these things. follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, uh uh meekness. Well, Brother Jason, those are those are fine. You know, you know, maybe you feel like you want to just pat me on the head and say, "Those are mighty sweet, pastor, but that's not going to make me number one in the world." Well, they make you number one with God. &gt;&gt; Well, that's not going to make me rich, but it'll give you heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you choose. As Moses said, choose. Like Elijah said, if God be God, serve him. If Baal be God, SERVE HIM. WHY? BECAUSE THAT'S SENSIBLE. If Baal's Bale, we need to go serve him. See, I want to serve the one who's REAL AND IN POWER. I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IT'S THE AUTHOR OF this book. &gt;&gt; So, for me, there's no um wishy-washiness in my mind. I'm I'm never I don't ever want to be found. AND AS SOON AS I CATCH myself trying to skirt around the edge of some principle in the word of God, I say, "Lord, forgive me. HELP ME TO HAVE THE mind which was in CHRIST JESUS WHO DID ALWAYS THAT which pleased the father." &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; You would think that being sons and daughters of God by a gene that that would come automatically. It does not. It did not come automatically in you. Though you were born with a gene of God, it did not come automatically in you until you were born again. &gt;&gt; And then even when you're born again by the Holy Ghost, hear me because this is a big point. This is a big point. This is important, you know, and I and I don't want to get ahead of myself in my notes, but but the the Holy Ghost baptism, the new birth, a baptism of the Holy Ghost in the new birth is the beginning of your service to God. It's not I mean IF IT WAS THE FINAL THING then you'd have already been taken in a rapture but we are we are daily shedding uh the world and putting on Christ. We daily we daily Paul is speaking to believers OH MAN OF GOD. WHY DOES HE HAVE TO SAY TO A MAN OF GOD FLEE YOUTHFUL flee these things? WHY WOULD HE HAVE TO SAY TO A MAN OF GOD [laughter] FOLLOW after righteousness? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we're humans &gt;&gt; and we live in unborn bodies. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With unborn spirits. &gt;&gt; The new birth changes the nature of the inner man. The nature of the spirit, which is the soul. See, it's the nature of the spirit. All right. Now, [clears throat] let me back up and and and I'll say, as they say, I'll back up and go forward. What we have found today and the day and hour that we live in is that just as Jesus now just just pay close attention. I'm not going to go uh long today, but I'm going to be very concise. I'm this is expository preaching what I'm do. That's the style they call it. It's expository. All right. [clears throat] So as Jesus was the combination of all the Old Testament saints, &gt;&gt; all the Old Testament anointings, &gt;&gt; he housed all of that in his single self. You understand? All the prophets and the anointing that was upon them. All the prophets, the priests, all the anointing that was on them. All the kings and the anointing that was on them. uh he was the prophets, priests, kings, and all the anointing on all of those offices in one. He was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. But as I've said to you before, there was never an intention by God to stay bottled up in a single man walking the shores of Galilee. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE HAD IN MIND WHEN HE SAID, "LET US MAKE MAN." When he said, "Let us make man," he's envisioning a kingdom of saints. Amen. &gt;&gt; WHERE SOMEDAY THE KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD WILL become the kingdoms of our LORD AND HIS CHRIST, HIS ANOINTED FAMILY. &gt;&gt; SEE, that's his that's that's the plan. So Jesus was simply a keystone between uh the Old Testament and the New Testament even with the work of Calvary. AND THIS TOOK A PROPHET TO uncover in the opening of the seals. And this is this will stand every CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST ON HIS EAR. uh it it required the opening OF THE SEVEN SEALED BOOK OR ULTIMATELY CALVARY WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR not &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; UNDERSTAND? BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE STILL COLLAPSED. HE COULD HAVE NEVER ESTABLISHED THE KINGDOM BECAUSE CALVARY WAS HIS purchasing work equally to OPENING THE SEVEN SEALS WAS HIS WORK of redemption that he's claiming the names in the book. SO HE'S PAYING THE PURCHASE PRICE AT CALVARY, BUT WHEN HE STEPS FORWARD FROM THE ETERNITIES TO CLAIM THE BOOK AND LOOSE THE SEALS, THAT'S HIS CLAIMING WORK. HIS CLAIMING work is JUST AS IMPORTANT AS HIS purchasing work. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE COULD BE NO CLAIM IF THERE HADN'T BEEN A PURCHASE. AND IF THERE WAS ONLY A PURCHASE AND NEVER A CLAIM, THEN IT'S ALL FOR NOT. AND THAT'S WHY JOHN WAS WEEPING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. JOHN WHO HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT OF AT GOLTHA WAS SO CLOSE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH JESUS ON THE CROSS AND THAT MAN WHO SAW CALVARY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER person started crying when no one was worthy to open the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does that inform your thinking? See? SO, [clears throat] SO JUST AS JESUS was the culmination of all the Old Testament and he was the keystone leading to the New Testament era, the bride of the last day is the culmination of all the powers of the living creatures. And that's an important POINT BECAUSE THEY HAD YOU say are there differences BETWEEN PAUL'S DAY AND OUR DAY? PROBABLY IN MY mind the chief difference is that they were under an anointing of the lion, not an eagle. &gt;&gt; They were under the anointing of the lion. You understand? And now under the anointing of the eagle, we have ALL FOUR ANOINTINGS OF THE MAN AND THE OF the e the lion, the ox and the man and the flying eagle. SO WE ARE THE CULMINATION. UH SO NOW NOW NOW WE CAN COME FULLY BACK TO WHAT JESUS WAS AS THE WORD MADE FLESH IN THE EARTH BECAUSE JESUS CARRIED THE CULMINATION OF ALL THE ANOINTINGS THOSE LIVING creatures proceeded from his throne. &gt;&gt; See [snorts] so all SO THEN ALL THE POWER OF THE living creatures is here today. This is why we have a restoration of truth about God &gt;&gt; and HIS WORD AND HIS FAMILY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; UNDERSTAND? IT IS A FULLY RESTORED TRUTH TO US IN JUSTIFICATION. WE'LL SKIP TO THE RESTORATION OF THE BRIDE TREE. LUTHER HAD A REVELATION that that we build upon UNDER AN EAGLE ANOINTING. LUTHER'S REVELATION UNDER UNDER STRICTLY the man age under manage anointing WAS THAT THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY HIS FAITH LAUNCHING FROM AN OLD TESTAMENT TEACHING. &gt;&gt; LUTHER DIDN'T INVENT THAT. THAT WAS IN THE BIBLE. SO LUTHER BRINGS THAT FORWARD. PEOPLE WHO SAY, "OH, THE OLD TESTAMENT DOESN'T COUNT." YOUR VERY JUSTIFICATION IN CHRIST COMES OUT OF THE OLD TESTAMENT. &gt;&gt; WHERE DO YOU THINK LUTHER GOT IT? AND SO SO WE WE REALIZE THEN THAT IT'S JUST LIKE PAUL WOULD TAKE THINGS OUT OF THE OLD TESTAMENT AND BRING THEM INTO THE NEW TESTAMENT ERA. SEE, SO SOMETIMES PEOPLE JUST THERE YOU THEY THEY TRY TO WORK AN END AROUND people try like crazy to work an end around, you know, around the the full truth. People have sit in churches and left it finally because they couldn't figure out the end around. Nobody would let them get away with it and preachers kept telling them they were wrong. They finally abandoned it and and then they then they then they want TO BACK UP AND SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW, MALACHI 4 WAS TO ISRAEL." NO KIDDING. IT CERTAINLY WASN'T TO THE EGYPTIANS or the Philistines. The whole ALL THE ENTIRE OLD TESTAMENT, BUT IT WAS TO ISRAEL. BUT DOES THAT MEAN I CANNOT GO BACK AND READ ISAIAH? BY HIS STRIPES, I'M HEALED. &gt;&gt; DOES THAT mean that HE WAS WOUNDED FOR MY TRANSGRESSION AND THE CHASTISEMENT OF MY PEACE WAS UPON HIM? I DON'T GET I CAN'T TAP INTO THAT CUZ THAT WAS TO ISRAEL. SEE, SO SO SOMETIMES PEOPLE THEY BLIND THEMSELVES and they become nonsensical when they when they and and it's what Paul said. They know nothing. It's what Paul said. We read it in our text. They know nothing. See, so when we come to the the restoration under the eagle age, then we have a FULLY RESTORED TRUTH, NOT Luther's limited version THAT I AM FORGIVEN OF MY SINS AND I have right standing in God. That's the revelation Luther had. I'm forgiven of my sins and I have right standing in the presence of God. BUT THE PER BUT THE FULLY RESTORED TRUTH BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL OF THE anointings and we have the opening of the book. THEN NOW WE HAVE A PERFECT FAITH TO HEAR RECOGNIZE AND ACT UPON ACT UPON THE REVELATION THAT THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH ACTING UPON THE FACT THAT WHEN I HAVE PASSED FROM DEATH TO LIFE IT'S AS THOUGH I NEVER SINNED IN THE FIRST PLACE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THEREFORE, I CONDUCT MYSELF AS IF I NEVER SINNED IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SATAN WANTS TO BATTLE MY MIND WITH. I CAN SIMPLY SAY TO HIM, "YEAH, BUT I NEVER DID THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE." &gt;&gt; SO HE CAN'T UPEND ME WITH DISCOURAGEMENT OVER MY PAST FAILURES. SEE, SO I'M I'M I'M ACTING upon that FACT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU UNDERSTAND? THAT'S NOT A PRINCIPLE THAT WE MEMORIZE. THIS IS AN ACTION WORD APPLYING TO YOUR LIFE. LIVE YOUR LIFE. THE JUST SHALL LIVE. ARE YOU JUSTIFIED? &gt;&gt; THEN LIVE AS THOUGH IN THE FREEDOM THAT YOU NEVER FAILED GOD IN THE FIRST PLACE. &gt;&gt; SATAN CAN'T KNOCK ME OUT OF THE RACE BECAUSE I'VE GOT THE FACTS. IN THE FIRST PLACE, I WAS IN CHRIST. YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE THAT'S TRUE, THEN I KNOW THAT'S HOW HE LOOKS AT ME NOW. GLORY BE TO GOD. THAT'S HOW HE LOOKS AT ME. NOW, THAT AIN'T ALWAYS HOW THE DEVIL LOOKS AT ME. IT AIN'T HOW YOU ALWAYS LOOK AT ME. IT AIN'T HOW I ALWAYS LOOK AT ME IN THE MIRROR, BUT IT'S HOW HE [screaming] LOOKS AT ME. I'M CARRYING A A HANDKERCHIEF IN MY OVER MY HEART THIS MORNING FOR SISTER KATHY WHO ASKED SPECIFICALLY HAVE BROTHER JASON PUT A HANDKERCHIEF IN AND PREACH AND I WANT THAT BROUGHT BACK TO ME AND WE'RE GOING TO BELIEVE THAT THE POWER OF FAITH WILL SAVE THE SICK. I SAID, "BROTHER JACK, JUST FOR HER HONORING THE MINISTRY, LET'S BELIEVE AND LET'S CLAIM IT THAT GOD IS GOING TO HEAL OUR SISTER. I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER SUFFER LIKE THAT." &gt;&gt; SEE, SO THERE'S POWER IN PRAYER. THERE'S POWER IN THE FAMILY OF GOD. IT'S NOT AN IMAGINED POWER. &gt;&gt; IT'S VERY REAL. SATAN IS JUST AFRAID YOU'LL BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO SO I'M I I you know, we we were WE WERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. UH WE KNOW THAT WE WERE IN THE MIND OF CHRIST. YOU SAY, and it's fair. YOU SAY, "BUT I WAS BORN IN SIN, &gt;&gt; not in the first place." Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU WERE NOT BORN IN SIN &gt;&gt; IN THE FIRST PLACE. &gt;&gt; SEE, &gt;&gt; SO WE HAVE A FULLY RESTORED TRUTH. WE'RE NOT LIMITED TO JOHN WESLEY'S UNDERSTANDING of sanctification, scripturally based, that without holiness, NO MAN SHALL SEE GOD. AND AND and and NOW NOW THINK WITH ME. OKAY, you're you're with me? &gt;&gt; All right, think with me. IF IF IF WITHOUT HOLINESS, no man CAN SEE GOD, IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN GOD CANNOT REQUIRE FROM YOUR LIFE SOMETHING THAT HE CANNOT AFFECT UPON YOUR LIFE AS YOU GIVE HIM AUTHORITY IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's a mouthful. I'm going to say it again. If if if IT'S TRUE THAT WITHOUT HOLINESS NO MAN CAN SEE GOD, THEN GOD CANNOT REQUIRE FROM YOUR LIFE SOMETHING THAT HE CAN'T AFFECT UPON YOUR LIFE IF AND AS YOU GIVE HIM AUTHORITY IN YOUR LIFE. I CANNOT BE HOLY ENOUGH FOR HIM, BUT I CAN RESPOND TO HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; I CAN HUMBLE MYSELF AND SAY, "LORD, I BELIEVE. HELP THOU MY UNBELIEF." AND I CAN STRIVE DAILY TO PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD. &gt;&gt; SO SANCTIFICATION WHERE YOU KNOW WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM AMPLIFIED LUTHER HE AMPLIFIED WESLEY BECAUSE WESLEY THOUGHT THAT THAT SANCTIFICATION WAS THE FINAL VICTORY BUT ELIJAH WAS GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND THAT SANCTIFICATION WAS A FURTHER WORK OF THE HOLY GHOST IN THE NEW BIRTH AND PART OF HAVING THE TOKEN ON DISPLAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO IT IT IS SPIRIT BORN SANCTIFICATION THAT IT PROPERLY IS spirit born and IT IS OPERATED BY THE HOLY GHOST OR ELSE IT'S JUST WORKS THAT ANYONE LIVING IN A COMMUNE CAN FOLLOW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And that's no THAT I MEAN A BUDDHIST LIVING IN IN A TEMPLE CAN FOLLOW CAN CAN CAN FOLLOW A LIST OF OF OF HOLINESS THINGS AND STAY AWAY AND AND LIVE CELIBATE AND AND NOT PARTAKE OF ANY KIND OF HORRIBLE THING. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF SANCTIFICATION UH THAT THAT'LL GET YOU AND THAT'S THAT GIVES YOU ACCEPTANCE BEFORE GOD. IT'S A IT'S A IT'S ALLOWING THE HOLY GHOST TO COME INTO YOUR LIFE AND AND TAKE YOU FROM DEATH UNTO LIFE IN A BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST AND YOU ARE A NEW CREATION IN CHRIST JESUS AND DAILY SANCTIFICATION. SANCTIFICATION IS NOT THE ENDGAME. SANCTIFICATION IS A DAILY EXERCISE OF HAVING THE TOKEN ON DISPLAY &gt;&gt; IN YOUR LIFE. SEE, HE AMPLIFIED THE ISUZA FATHERS BECAUSE THEY TAPPED INTO A RESTORED POWER. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IT WAS A A POWER THAT CHURCH HAD KIND OF BEEN LACKING AND IT RESTORED SOME POWER THAT THE CHURCH HAD BEEN MISSING. And it RAMPED UP IN A LARGE WAY THE OPERATION OF THE GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT UH THAT PENTECOSTAL FATHERS THOUGHT WAS THE TOTAL VICTORY. &gt;&gt; Just like Luther thought justification WAS THE TOTAL VICTORY. WESLEY THOUGHT SANCTIFICATION WAS TOTAL VICTORY. It t IT TOOK A PROPHET TO COME AND GO, "NO, IT'S PART OF IT. NO, IT'S PART OF IT. NO, IT'S PART OF IT. THE GIFTS ARE PART OF IT. POWER IS PART OF IT. BUT THE DEVIL CAN IMPERSONATE THAT STUFF. SEE, SO SO A PROPHET KNEW THAT SATAN COULD IMPERSONATE IT. AND UNDER THE OPENING OF THE SEVEN SEALS, HE LAYS DOWN A PERFECT PATH IN THE WORD TO GO BEYOND THE GIFTS TO THE GIVER &gt;&gt; of the gifts. So, IT'S AN EAGLE ANOINTING WITH A PERFECT WORD THAT IS RESTORED AND A PROPHECY OF VICTORY OVER THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THAT PROPHECY UH OR THE PROPHECY IS A CONSEQUENCE OF OF THE MIND OF GOD AND GOD'S PLAN IN REDEMPTION. IT IS GOD'S PLAN OF redemption that THE BRIDE ULTIMATELY IS IMPERVIOUS TO DECEPTION. THAT GOD SET THAT UP. &gt;&gt; THAT DIDN'T BECOME TRUE BECAUSE WILLIAM BRANDHAM SAID IT. &gt;&gt; HE ONLY SAID WHAT WAS OBVIOUS in the word. &gt;&gt; UNDERSTAND THIS BRIDE HAS GOT TO PROVE THE SECOND EVE IS GOING TO PROVE SHE'S NOT LIKE THE FIRST EVE IN GENESIS. SHE'S NOT LIKE ISRAEL WANTING A KING. SHE'S NOT LIKE THE EARLY CHURCH THAT FELL AT NIKA. THIS BRIDE IS PREDESTINATED TO NOT [screaming] FALL. HALLELUJAH. SHE IS IN SHE CAN SHE CAN HAVE A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE WORD. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEVIL CONVINCING HER TO NOT BELIEVE EVERY WORD OF GOD, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. SHE'S IMPERVIOUS TO THAT. I CANNOT HELP BUT BE A BELIEVER. I CANNOT HELP BUT BELIEVE IT. I HEAR IT. I FEED UPON IT. AND THE MORE I GET, THE MORE I WANT. HALLELUJAH. THE MORE IT CAUSES ME TO BECOME, THE MORE I WANT TO BE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SATAN HAS NO CHANCE TO DECEIVE ME. THE BRIDE OF [screaming] THE LAST DAY WITH ALL FOUR ANOINTINGS HAS A FAITH THAT IS IMPENETRABLE. HER DETERMINATION IS UNSTOPPABLE. AND FOR SURE HER IDENTITY IS UNDENIABLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; She is already hear me. &gt;&gt; She is already the final voice &gt;&gt; to the final age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Last Sunday we played a video and I want to play it again today. And I just want to say to the listeners streaming, I had a couple of uh inquiries uh in North America and some overseas to say they couldn't see it when it was being played. Brothers, sisters, we're not sure why that happened on your end, but we had many other people saying they saw it just fine. It's on the archive. We're hoping it'll come through for you today. If it doesn't, you can go on YouTube and get the archive and I'm sure that it will show. Many people saying, "Hey, I couldn't see what was going on. I'd like to see that." So now, when we showed this thing uh about harmony that can be achieved in metronomes and we said to you this pure science because what and and I wanted to just show it again because I got one follower right on the heels of it. Now, what I'm demonstrating to you is the is the scripture and just while they get that ready, just listen to this reading. So [clears throat] he that descended is the same also. This is Ephesians 4. He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things. And he gave some APOSTLES AND SOME PROPHETS and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for THE EDIFYING OF THE BODY of Christ. Those are all positive, &gt;&gt; right? You see, he's building, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Building is positive. He's going forward TILL UNTIL WE ALL ALL OF US come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Here's why. THAT WE HENCEFORTH RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. RIGHT NOW IN OUR EVERYDAY WALKING TALKING LIFE THAT WE HENCEFORTH NO BE NO MORE CHILDREN TOSSED TO AND FRO AND CARRIED ABOUT WITH every wind of DOCTRINE BY THE SLIGHT of men. SEE, HE SENT YOU PREACHERS SO YOU CAN'T BE TAKEN AWAY BY THE SLIGHT OF CUNNING MEN. HE SENT YOU PASTORS, PRO A PRO PROPHETS, APOSTLES, PASTORS, TEACHERS, EVANGELISTS. THAT'S TO PROTECT YOU FROM BEING CARRIED AWAY BY CUNNING MEN. SEE, AND SO AND AND TOSSED TO AND FRO AND CARRIED CARRIED ABOUT WITH EVERY WIND OF DOCTRINE BY THE SLIGHT OF MEN AND CUNNING CRAFTINESS, WHEREBY they lie and wait to deceive, but speaking the truth IN LOVE MAY GROW UP INTO HIM IN ALL THINGS WHICH IS THE HEAD, EVEN CHRIST. SO, YOU'RE GROWING INTO SOMETHING. NOW, THIS 16TH VERSE IS REALLY WHAT THIS VIDEO IS ABOUT. FROM WHOM THE WHOLE BODY FITLY JOINED TOGETHER AND COMPACTED BY that which every joint SUPPLIETH ACCORDING TO THE effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. So, you remember when brother Brandham TOLD THE STORY, HE WAS ON HIS SADDLE horse and he rode way out in the wilderness and the Lord led him into a into an area where they had had a burnover and THERE WAS A WHOLE WHOLE PATCH OF forest that it WAS NOTHING BUT BLACK JUST STIFF OLD DEAD BURNT TREES. There was there WAS JUST NO LIFE THERE. HE SAID LIKE A A FOREST GRAVEYARD. And he went in THERE AND HE SAID IT WAS SPOOKY. AND HE SAID YOU COULD HEAR THAT WIND HOWLING THROUGH THERE. WOO. And brother BRANDHAM SAID, "SEE, IT'S LIKE A DENOMINATION. WOO! The days of miracles are passed." Woo! It don't matter how you live, you can still be a Christian. WOO! UH, FATHER, SON, AND HOLY GHOST IS THREE separate people. Woo! You know, there's no signs that follow the believers. Just go to church. And brother Brandham SAID, YOU KNOW, HE SAID IT WAS A ALL THOSE TREES were just stiff, &gt;&gt; burnt, &gt;&gt; dried. See, AND SO WE SHOWED YOU THAT. THAT'S WHY WHEN A CHURCH IS BUILT ON THAT KIND OF A RIGID foundation that has no living movement to it. Brother Brandham said if they'd have just ended their creed with a comma, it would have stayed open for movement. But they ended it with a period. We believe this and nothing more. Then they cut themselves OFF FROM FURTHER REVELATION DOWN THROUGH THE AGES AND GOD SIMPLY PUT THEM ON A SHELF AND MOVED ON TO THE NEXT AGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT WE FIND IS THAT WE'RE BASED ON THE FOUNDATION OF CHRIST AND CHRIST IS A LIVING WORD. &gt;&gt; AND SO WE SHOWED YOU WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN METRONOMES, THIS IS SCIENCE PART OF IT, WHEN METRONOMES ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF HARMONY, OUT OF SYNC, OUT OF RHYTHM, JUST LIKE A CHURCH CAN GET. IT'S LIKE A FAMILY, JUST LIKE A MARRIAGE. BUT BECAUSE THAT IT THE PLATFORM IS SOLID, BUT THE PLATFORM IS ON MOVING FOUNDATION. SO IT'S A LIVING PLATFORM. I I'M SHOWING IT AS A TYPE OF A LIVING FOUNDATION OF THE LIVING WORD. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS, NOT ONLY DOES THE DOES THE MOVING PLATFORM TRANSMIT ENERGY BECAUSE BECAUSE NOAH EXPLAINED THIS TO ME IN PHYSICS THAT THAT EVERYTHING THAT THAT EVERYTHING WANTS TO COME INTO HARMONY. THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE LAW OF NATURE. IT WANTS TO IT'S TRYING TO GET IN HARMONY. AND THAT MOVEMENT IF IT'S IF IT'S STIFF THEN THEY JUST THEY TICK TOCK TICK TOCK AND EVERYBODY ARGUES AND EVERYBODY HATES ONE ANOTHER AND THERE'S NO POWER. YOU UNDERSTAND? BUT WHEN THAT PLATFORM CAN MOVE IT SENDS ENERGY. THOSE TICKING ARE CONNECTED AND THE ENERGY IS FLOWING BACK AND FORTH FROM THEM TO THE PLATFORM AND TO EACH OTHER &gt;&gt; AND TO EACH OTHER AND EVERY JOINT SUPPLY. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? AND THEN THAT BRINGS EVERYTHING BACK INTO PERFECT PRECISION FOR THE EDIFYING OF THE CHURCH TILL WE ALL COME INTO THE UNITY OF THE FAITH. &gt;&gt; So does THAT MAKE SENSE? &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, LET'S VIEW IT AGAIN. BROTHER KEVIN, notice the cans under it. It allows it to move. Say, "Oh, that's close enough." No, it's not. Watch it. It keeps going. I don't want it I don't want the church to be almost perfect. I want it to be perfect. Watch this. Give me some more volume. C. NOW, let's make the church bigger. Now, we're going to get a mega church. It needs help. And there's some that are not going to cooperate. And he's going to have to go correct them, too. But look at what's happening. IT'S ALL OUT OF SYNC. There's no harmony. There's no power. Watch him. Yeah. Fix those couple in the back back there. I'm just kidding. Look at that. Click, click, click, click, click. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Every joint supply. Thank you, brother Kevin. Now, I showed you that last Sunday. Now, I'm going to and and I've explained how the devil can get in there and break up that harmony. Now, I'm going to show you another science. And this woman is a scientist herself, and I did a little bit of a bio on her on her background. I'm not going to get into it today, but she is herself a scientist of the field she's discussing. She's taking up as a because as a sidebar, she she um she does music. Uh I'm not sure what she's involved with it, but she um things in music in the music world u fascinate her. And so she did a video as a scientist about the about the same thing you just saw about how these this energy moves that and you're going to see her HERE IN A MINUTE TALK about even even people listening to the same music together that they can they can absolutely be in disharmony BUT IF THEY HEAR THE RIGHT MUSIC they can come right into harmony and that one will affect the other. &gt;&gt; You understand? All right. NOW NOW WATCH WHAT HAPPENS. ALL RIGHT, LET'S PLAY THAT ONE, BROTHER KEVIN. &gt;&gt; And to have compassion for each other. And when you look at it from a neuroscience perspective, which I've looked through a lot of different neuroscience papers on music's effects on the brain and music's effects on people's psychology. There is actually evidence that backs up this idea that music can bring people together. When we listen to music, when we sing or dance to songs that really move us, our brains release a hormone called oxytocin. So, this is a hormone that's largely responsible for social bonding uh and social connection. So, the release of oxytocin when you listen to music can actually make you feel closer to other people. And then music also activates the pleasure and reward centers of our brain. Uh so specifically there's a region in the brain called the nucleus encumbent. So this combinational activation of the reward systems and the bonding regions of the brain help to promote pro-social uh bonding type behavior. Also when we listen to music with other people, our brains actually start to mirror the emotional states of the people that we're listening the mu to the music with. This is largely due to a type of neuron called the mirror neurons in our brains. And so this allows us to become in sync with the emotions of the people with whom we're lo listening to the music. So people's brains literally get on the same wavelength and sync up emotionally when they listen to music that really resonates with them. So really, if you if you look at that data, it really seems that music really is that universal language that tunes our brains to feel closer and more connected to one another. And I think that's so beautiful. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I'm sure, thank you, Kev. I'm sure that that we can all see the opportunity for the Holy Ghost to bind us together in love and harmony with the right kind of worship music. &gt;&gt; Is that easy? &gt;&gt; See, that's scientific evidence. Our our music matters. &gt;&gt; The things you listen to matter. &gt;&gt; You understand? And if we can have love and harmony together, you release the full power of God in our midst. Could there be anything of more value than releasing the full power of God in our midst? &gt;&gt; See, but I'm also sure that we can that we can equally see the opportunity Satan has to do just the opposite if he can get in the middle of the program. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, WHEN THEY BUILT THE TOWER, YOU WE WE CAN GO AND we can look at at the upper room experience. They were all in one mind and one accord &gt;&gt; and you see what happened. You've been reading that story since a child. [gasps] BUT BUT THAT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT HAPPENED. THAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY BUILT THE TOWER OF BABEL. AND THE BIBLE SAYS THEY WERE OF one speech and one language. And that meant that they had the same dialect. AND IT MEANT it's a different Hebrew word. That meant they had the that they had the same motives and objectives. AND SO THEY WERE IN ONE MIND AND ONE ACCORD AT BABEL AND ONE MIND AND ONE ACCORD IN THE UPPER ROOM. AND GOD CAME DOWN AND LOOKED AT THAT HARMONY THEY HAD, WHICH WAS CONTRARY. THE THE PLAN AND THE MOTIVE THEY HAD WAS TO HAVE AN END AROUND AGAINST GOD. IF HE EVER FLOODED THE WORLD, WE COULD run up INTO OUR TOWER AND WE MIGHT JUST BUILD THIS THING BIG ENOUGH AND WE'LL BREAK BACK INTO HEAVEN. COME ON. &gt;&gt; HOW ART THOU FALLEN FROM HEAVEN, OH LUCIFER? HE'S GOT THE SAME PLAN. IT'S NOT NEW. YOU UNDERSTAND? AND GOD LOOKED AT THAT AND SAID, "NOW THIS THEY HAVE BEGUN TO DO, AND NOTHING CAN BE RESTRAINED, EVEN WHAT THEY CAN IMAGINE." AND SO GOD NOW USES THE ENEMY'S TACTIC AND BRINGS CONFUSION AND THAT BREAKS THE POWER IN THE BUILDING AND THE WHOLE THING COMES TO NOTHING. ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, THEY WERE IN ONE MIND AND ONE ACCORD AND SUDDENLY THERE CAME A SOUND FROM HEAVEN THAT FILLED THE HOUSE WHERE THEY WERE SITTING AND THEY BECAME THE EXTENSION OF THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST. THE SON OF MAN MINISTRY WAS NOW ALIVE AND WELL IN THE EARTH AGAIN. &gt;&gt; Even though Christ had went to heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, SO SO THESE THINGS THIS THIS SHOULD WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW THIS IS WHY WORSHIP IS so I mean EVEN ISRAEL WHEN THEY'D GO TO WAR THEY THEY LED WITH SINGERS AND WORSHIP. WORSHIP IS IMPORTANT. DON'T MISS OUT ON IT. IT'S IMPORTANT to you. It brings YOU IN HARMONY AND SYNC WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND SETS YOUR MIND IN A POSITION TO HEAR THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; SEE? [snorts] AMEN. Brother Brandham, now I want to I'm doing good. I want to turn turn a corner. You good? [snorts] Brother Brandham took a sizable amount of his ministry to teach on the battle of the human mind. Uh, brother Brandham talks calls it the greatest battle ever fought in one of the key sermons. But that's not the only time brother Brandham. Brother Brandham takes that theme throughout. It's pervasive throughout the message. Brother Brandham is all the time talking about he would even say things like the right mental attitude toward the promise of God can bring it to pass. See, so he so he talks about your faith and your confession. And these are all these are all characteristics that come out of the dynamo that is you. Brother Matt was speaking about the dynamo. You are a dynamo. You have a living spirit inside you. It causes your body to run at 98 degrees. And if your spirit leaves it, your body will cool down. &gt;&gt; See? So you have a dynamo inside you. And so that's the real you. That's what animates the body. The body is just a temple the real you lives lives in. And that that's that REAL YOU HAS A NATURE. Either it's born again or it's not. &gt;&gt; It's not halfway or two threequarters of the way or kind of born again. It either is born again or it's not born again. That's right. &gt;&gt; SO, SO BROTHER BRANDHAM TAKES A LARGE part of his ministry to teach on the battle in the human mind between divine and demonic influence. So the reason being is that it touches a fundamental human capacity choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE CHOICE IS A HUMAN CAPACITY, it is also a human vulnerability. Christ lived, died, rose, ascended, sent back the Holy Ghost to remedy just this problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The problem existed ALL THROUGH THE OLD TESTAMENT, even in his seed gene family. &gt;&gt; This is why David, a man after God's own heart, this is why David could do the things he did with Ba Sheba and even involving murder. This is this is the problem. This is why Abraham gets caught lying twice to save his hide. I mean th this is why Joseph DID I MEAN JACOB DID WHAT HE DID. I mean th THIS AND BROTHER RAM SAID YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF GRACE WHEN YOU come to come to Jacob because my goodness what a shyer and and just a REPEATED YOU KNOW CONSTANTLY REPEATING it until God changed him in a spiritual type changed his name to Israel meaning prince. AND THAT'S WHAT GOD did to you by the new birth. HE TOOK YOU FROM BEING JUST A LOST HUMAN TO A BORN AGAIN HUMAN. &gt;&gt; And so now he's able TO HAVE AN EFFECT UPON THIS UNIQUE HUMAN CAPACITY OF CHOICE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY Ghost now and I'm really really I've chosen my words so carefully. The baptism OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT came at the feast of Pentecost in Jerusalem 2,000 years ago changes the nature of the inner man by a supernatural power. It's not your flesh that gets born again or your spirit. It's your nature. &gt;&gt; And that is and that works because there's a gene of God inside that is dormant before you're born again. You're born with that gene of God. YOU GO ALL YOUR LIFE UNTIL GOD hawks you down and trips you, KNOCKS YOU DOWN, WHATEVER HE HAS TO DO. The Holy GHOST ALWAYS GETS HIS MAN OR HIS LADY. AND WE FIND OUT THAT HE WILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH. AND WHEN THE HOLY GHOST IS CHASING YOU, YOU WILL NOT GET AWAY. I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO STOP, DROP, AND ROLL. THROW UP YOUR HANDS AND SAY, "I surrender all." BECAUSE HE HE WILL HE'LL SEND THE FISHERMAN, AND I'M A FISHERMAN TODAY. BUT IF THE FISHERMAN CAN'T CATCH YOU, HE'LL SEND A HUNTER. AND YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH HIM BECAUSE HE'S A DEAD SHOT. YEAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO WE FIND THEN THAT THAT THAT I WANT TO SAY IT AGAIN THAT THIS POWER THAT CAME AT THE FEAST OF PENTECOST, IT CAME to change the nature of our inner man BY A SUPERNATURAL POWER. CHANGE THE NATURE of our spirit. So now THEN WITH CHRIST LIVING IN us and through us, THE KINGDOM CAN FINALLY START DOWN THE ROAD to the millennial reign. AND MOREOVER, AS I SAID EARLIER, UNTIL THE KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD BECOME the kingdoms of our Lord and his bride. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? SO THAT THAT new nature opens up and it empowers your human capacity to believe all the word of God. &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THE SPIRIT DOING THAT FOR YOU, YOU CANNOT BELIEVE ALL the word of God. PAUL SAID, "YOUR FALLEN SPIRIT MIND IS ENMITY AGAINST GOD. IT CAN NEVER AGREE WITH GOD." HE SAID, "SOMETIMES THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS TO START DEALING WITH YOU JUST SO HE CAN GET YOU TO AGREE WITH HIM. AND IF HE CAN GET YOU TO AGREE WITH HIM, THEN THAT OLD NATURE DIES AND YOU'RE BORN AGAIN." &gt;&gt; SEE, AND OUTSIDE OF THAT, YOU'LL RESIST, YOU'LL END AROUND, YOU'LL RE YOU'LL TRY TO GET OUT OF IT. YOU'LL YOU'LL BUCK AGAINST UH HOLINESS AND GODLINESS, AND YOU WON'T LIKE EVERYTHING THE PREACHER SAYS. I LISTEN FRIENDS, WE'RE ONLY HERE TO TRY TO SAVE YOUR LIFE. I'M SORRY I OFFEND YOU. I'M TRYING TO SAVE YOUR LIFE. I'M TRYING TO GET US ALL IN THE RAPTURE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S ALL I AM. I'M JUST A SHEPHERD ON A HILLSIDE. THAT THE LORD SENT ME OUT WITH SOME SHEEP AND SAID, "TAKE THESE INTO THE WILDERNESS AND GROW THEM AND MATURE THEM AND BRING THEM BACK TO ME BEARING WOOL." THAT'S WHO I AM. THAT'S WHAT I DO. AND HERE WE GO. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY WANT TO GO BACK BEARING WOOL? &gt;&gt; AMEN. SEE? SO, SO THIS NEW NATURE, IT OPENS UP AND IT EMPOWERS THAT HUMAN CAPACITY you have BECAUSE BEFORE THAT HUMAN CAPACITY COULD CHOOSE, it could CHOOSE GOOD AND EVIL TO A DEGREE, BUT IT COULD NEVER comprehend or fully choose from THE HEART ALL OF GOD'S WORD. IT COULD LIVE IN A COMMUNE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; IT COULD LIVE AS A AS A BUDDHIST MONK. &gt;&gt; IT COULD LIVE AS A AS A AS A HOLY HOLINESS LEGALIST. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT GOD WAS AFTER. THAT'S THAT HE WANTED TO GO BEYOND WESLEY'S UNDERSTANDING. HE WANTED TO CHANGE YOU FROM THE VERY INSIDE AND MAKE YOU A NEW CREATION IN CHRIST JESUS SO THAT YOU WOULD DAILY WANT TO PUT ON HOLINESS AND TAKE OFF THE WORLD. YOU WOULD DAILY WANT TO GET CLOSER TO GOD. YOU EVERY TIME THE CHURCH DOORS ARE OPEN, YOU'D WANT TO BE HERE IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO IT OPENS UP YOUR HUMAN CAPACITY TO BELIEVE ALL THE word of God. Jesus made that clear. There's no one CAN COME TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH HIM AND THAT YOU'RE EFFECTIVELY LOCKED OUT BECAUSE THE OTHER FLIP OF THE COIN IS NO ONE CAN COME TO CHRIST UNLESS THE HOLY SPIRIT DRAWS him and them to whom the Holy Spirit will reveal him. So Jesus isn't uh people say WELL THE YOU KNOW SALVATION IS FREE INDEED IT IS BUT YOU CAN'T STEAL IT. &gt;&gt; You can't buy it or STEAL IT. IT'S A GIFT GIVEN TO YOU BY GOD. BUT YOU CAN'T JUST WALK UP AND TAKE IT. IT'S GOT TO BE OFFERED TO YOU AND YOU'VE GOT TO COME WITH A CONTRITE HEART WHICH GOD LOVES. &gt;&gt; SEE, BROTHER RANDOM SAID YOU CAN'T REPENT JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO HELL. OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO HELL. &gt;&gt; SEE, but it's MORE THAN THAT. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING. THIS IS WHAT THE APOSTLE TRYING TO GET YOU TO. SO, SO THE SO ONCE YOUR HUMAN CAPACITY HAS BEEN MOVED UPON, your human capacity TO CHOICE AND THAT HAS BEEN OPENED UP TO BELIEVE ALL THE WORD OF GOD, THEN AND ONLY THEN CAN THE APPLICATION OF THAT WORD AND ITS POWER BE BROUGHT FULLY TO BEAR IN OUR DAILY LIVES DAILY. &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, you'll be on and off. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you'll be in and out. &gt;&gt; You'll be up and down. I don't say you don't love God. I don't say you don't believe the word. I'm just simply saying you need to find Calvary. You need to have an experience where something gets a hold of that nature and changes it. &gt;&gt; It's a supernatural power. And then you won't you won't buck against God's word. You won't try to end around on holiness or godliness. YOU'LL WANT MORE OF IT. &gt;&gt; SEE? SO, SO, SO THAT IS TO SAY THAT WHEN THE WHEN THE TOKEN UH IS DAILY APPLIED, HEAR ME NOW, WHEN THE TOKEN IS DAILY APPLIED, it keeps you deeply hidden in Christ. AND SATAN'S GATEWAYS TO INFLUENCE YOU IS CLOSED off and he is effectively held at bay. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is nuts and bolts. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS NOT JUST ME SAYING JUST COME DOWN HERE AND LET ME LAY HANDS ON YOU. YOU NEED THE HOLY GHOST. THAT'S THE TRUTH. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. BUT THE TOKEN HAS GOT TO BE PUT ON DISPLAY. AND WHEN YOU PUT THE TOKEN AND DAILY APPLY IT, I'M SAYING IT AGAIN. THAT IS WHAT KEEPS you deeply HIDDEN IN CHRIST. AND IF YOU'RE DEEPLY HIDDEN IN CHRIST, THEN THE UNCONVERTED FLESH AND SPIRIT, THOSE GATEWAYS FOR SATAN TO INFLUENCE YOU, HE IS CLOSED OFF BECAUSE YOU'RE SO FAR INTO CHRIST, SATAN CAN'T EVEN FIND YOU. &gt;&gt; LORD, &gt;&gt; SO HE IS EFFECTIVELY HELD AT BAY. YOUR FLESH IS STILL NOT CONVERTED, BUT HE'S HELD AT BAY. &gt;&gt; YOUR SPIRIT IS STILL NOT CONVERTED, BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE CASTING DOWN REASON AND VAIN IMAGINATIONS. THAT'S A NUT AND A BOLT. YOU'RE CASTING DOWN VAIN IMAGINATIONS. YOU'RE BRINGING EVERY THOUGHT CAPTIVE TO THE WORD OF GOD. BECAUSE IF I BRING A A WRONG THOUGHT TO THE HOLY SPIRIT, HE WILL DESTROY IT. BUT IF I ENTERTAIN IT AND LOOK AT IT AND ROLL IT AROUND, THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THAT THOUGHT WILL LEAD TO A WORD OR AN ACTION, AND YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF PILED UP IN A CORNER CRYING OUT TO GOD FOR REPENTANCE. &gt;&gt; I I'VE HAD MY SHARE OF THAT. AND I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SAY TODAY, LORD, I'D LIKE TO BEGIN TODAY, AND I'D LIKE TO WALK TO ZION. I'D LIKE TO MOVE UP HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER IN MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; I I AM BORN AGAIN BY THE SPIRIT OF THE HOLY GHOST, BUT I WANT TO APPLY &gt;&gt; the word of God. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; THIS IS SEE WHEN WE SAY APPLYING THE TOKEN DAILY DEEPLY HIDES YOU IN CHRIST AND EFFECTIVELY KEEPS SATAN AT BAY BECAUSE HE CAN'T HE HIS GATEWAYS ARE CLOSED OFF BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDER SANCTIFICATION. Your eyes, your feet, where you go, what you do, what you listen to, what you partake of, what you're involved with. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me do like Fred Mullins. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is when you do that, that is by definition letting the mind which was in Christ be in you. WHEN YOU APPLY THE TOKEN DAILY AND CLOSE OFF THE GATES FOR SATAN TO REACH YOU BECAUSE you're deeply hidden, THAT IS BY DEFINITION LETTING THE word of God dwell in you richly. &gt;&gt; Friends, think with me again. You ready? Paul would have no need to admonish the church with this truth in principle if the baptism of the new birth by the Holy Ghost alone were enough. &gt;&gt; If the baptism of the Holy Ghost, that initial moment when you're born again, and it is an it is an experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. When if that WAS ALL YOU NEEDED, PAUL WOULD NOT NEED TO SAY to the church, "Let the mind which was in Christ BE IN YOU." HE'S ALREADY TALKING TO BELIEVERS. &gt;&gt; Let the word of God dwell IN YOU RICHLY. LET IT PERMIT IT. ALLOW IT. You You do that. See, &gt;&gt; SO THIS IS WHY THIS IS WHY THE BIBLE TEACHES US THAT WE ARE IN OUR TEXT, WE READ IT, WE ARE TO FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT OF FAITH. WE are to, AS WE'VE BEEN STUDYING, PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD. WE ARE, AS THE APOSTLE TEACHES US, A DIFFERENT ONE, GIRD UP THE LOINS OF YOUR MIND. WHY DOES HE GOT TO SAY THAT? WHY DOES PETER NEED TO SAY GIRD UP THE LOINS OF YOUR MIND? OH MY, KEVIN, LET'S LET'S HAVE SOME UH Bible verses. Sorry to jump you, bud. I just happen to think I want to put them up. We're going to go to 1 Timothy 6. This was this was our text, so should be able to get right to it. 1 Timothy 6:11 and 12. But thou, oh man of God, born again, filled with the spirit, man of God, flee these things and follow after righteousness, man of God. Here's what you need to do. BUT I'M BORN AGAIN. RIGHT? AND THIS IS WHY YOU CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. OTHERWISE, YOU COULD HAVE NEVER DONE THIS. YOU COULD HAVE NEVER APPROACHED HIM. YOU COULD HAVE NEVER BELIEVED ALL EVERY WORD OF GOD BECAUSE OF THAT HUMAN VULNERABILITY OF CHOICE THAT HUMAN CAPACITY. BUT GOD HAS CAME DOWN AND CHANGED THE NATURE WHERE THE CHOICE IS MADE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; UNDERSTAND? AS A MAN THINKKETH IN HIS HEART, SO IS HE. SEE, &gt;&gt; SO FOLLOW AFTER RIGHTEOUSNESS, GODLINESS, FAITH, LOVE, PATIENCE, MEEKNESS. FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT OF FAITH. LAY HOLD ON ETERNAL LIFE WHERE UNTO THOU ART CALLED. YOU WERE CALLED TO PUT SATAN UNDER YOUR FEET. GET HIM OUT OF YOUR MIND AND PUT HIM UNDER YOUR FEET. &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT. THERE WAS A BATTLE. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID GOD AND SATAN AGREED THAT THE BATTLEGROUND WOULD BE THE MIND, THE MIND OF MAN. BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD SAY, BUT THE IDEA IS NOT TO KEEP DRAGGING IT OUT. THIS IS NOT A WAR OF ATTRITION. HE SAID, YOU WANT TO DEFEAT HIM RIGHT NOW. YOU WANT TO PUT HIM UNDER YOUR FEET. GET HIM OUT OF YOUR MIND. GET HIM OUT OF YOUR LIFE AND PUT HIM UNDER YOUR FEET. &gt;&gt; SEE, how do I do that, brother Jason? Here's a starting line for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You ready for a nut and a bolt? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ready for SOME RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD? &gt;&gt; HERE'S A STARTING LINE, BROTHER JASON. HOW DO I DO THAT? HOW DO I GET HIM OUT OF MY MIND AND UNDER MY FEET? PHILIPPIANS 4:8. WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE TRUE, &gt;&gt; WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE HONEST, PHILIPPIANS 4:8. WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE JUST, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE PURE, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE LOVELY, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE OF A GOOD REPORT, IF THERE BE ANY VIRTUE and if any praise, think on these things. &gt;&gt; BORN AGAIN PEOPLE, THINK ON THESE THINGS. BELIEVERS, THINK ON THESE THINGS. YOU LOVE GOD, THINK ON THESE THINGS. SEE &gt;&gt; FIRST PETER CHAPTER 1 verses 13- 16. Wherefore believers, BORN AGAIN PEOPLE, &gt;&gt; WHEREFORE GIRD UP THE LOINS OF YOUR MIND, &gt;&gt; see they wore LOOSE GARMENTS AND WHEN THEY HAD TO WORK OR they had to run OR THEY HAD TO CLIMB, THEY THEY WE TODAY WE WOULD SAY CINCH UP YOUR BELT. THEY WOULD THEY WOULD GATHER EVERYTHING IN AND TIE IT TIGHT. JESUS DID THAT. THE DISCIPLES DID THAT. AND SO THAT THAT SO PETER IS USING THIS SAME METAPHOR TO SAY, "GUARD UP THE LOINS OF YOUR MIND BECAUSE YOU GOT TO FIGHT. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO BUILD. YOU GOT TO BE SOMETHING FOR GOD." SEE, GIRD UP THE LOINS OF YOUR MIND. BE SOBER AND HOPE TO THE END FOR THE GRACE THAT IS TO BE BROUGHT UNTO YOU AT THE REVELATION of Jesus Christ. Do you realize that a special grace was assigned for this end time day? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God knew it would be so dark and so impossible. He made a promise in his word. I remember many years ago as this a young preacher, Brother Donnie read that to me and showed me that in the scripture. I about had a a running fit. And he said, "Wherefore, g up the loins of your mind. Be sober. HOPE TO THE end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ." These were believers who already had a revelation in the new birth. But I'm here to tell YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. WE ARE LIVING IN THE DAY OF THE FULL AND THE COMPLETE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST. GOOD NEWS. THERE'S A GRACE FOR YOU TODAY AND A GRACE FOR YOU TOMORROW AND A GRACE FOR YOU NEXT WEEK. OH, [screaming] HALLELUJAH. LET US ASCEND TO THE KINGDOM. THERE'S POWER ON ON DISPLAY FOR US. THERE'S POWER AVAILABLE TO YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A A HUMAN CAPACITY OF CHOICE. THAT'S A HUMAN VULNERABILITY. PUT IT UNDER THE BLOOD. THINK [screaming] THINK WORD THOUGHTS. LIVE WORD LIFE. APPLY IT DAILY. PUT SATAN UNDER YOUR FEET. CAST DOWN VAIN IMAGINATIONS. GIRD UP THE LOINS OF YOUR MIND. BE SOBER AND HOPE TO THE END. VERSE 14. AS OBEDIENT CHILDREN, NOT FASHIONING YOURSELVES ACCORDING TO THE FORMER LUST IN YOUR IGNORANCE, but as he which hath called you as holy, SO BE YE HOLY IN ALL MANNER OF CONVERSATION. THAT'S A LIFESTYLE. BECAUSE IT IS WRITTEN, "Be ye holy, for I am holy." &gt;&gt; Friends, how many of OF GOD'S APOSTLES AND PROPHETS DO I have to read TO YOU TODAY TO GET YOU TO BELIEVE THIS IS THE PATHWAY TO VICTORY? &gt;&gt; HOW MANY MORE QUOTES AND AND SCRIPTURES I COULD READ TODAY, BUT FOR THE SAKE OF TIME? THIS IS SURE AND STEADFAST. YES. &gt;&gt; SEE, YOU SAY, "BROTHER JASON, WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT? THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST OR PUTTING ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD?" BOTH. &gt;&gt; OKAY, let me let me say it more clearly. WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT? BOTH. &gt;&gt; OKAY, LET ME REPHRASE. WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT? BOTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OKAY, LET ME BE MESSAGE POLITICALLY CORRECT. WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT? BOTH. &gt;&gt; BOTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You're gonna have to have them both. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? I I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE PASSED FROM DEATH TO LIFE CAN NEVER COME INTO THE JUDGMENT. I GET THAT. BUT I DON'T WANT TO WALK AROUND A FAILURE. AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU WALK AROUND A FAILURE. I UNDERSTAND THAT ELECTION TRUMPS EVERYTHING. I UNDERSTAND THAT. I UNDERSTAND IF I WAS IN HIS MIND, I COULD NEVER BE LOST. I UNDERSTAND THAT THING. BUT I'VE STILL GOT APOSTLES TELLING ME, "GIRD UP THE LOINS OF YOUR MIND. &gt;&gt; BE SOBER MINDED. CAST DOWN VAIN IMAGINATIONS. PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD. &gt;&gt; FLEE LUST AND PURSUE RIGHTEOUSNESS. CHASE IT. GO AFTER IT. TRACK IT DOWN. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM IN THE SEVENTH SEAL. I'M GOING TO CLOSE WITH THIS. Uh Anthony, bring your team and come on back if it's you or whoever you're assigning it to. [clears throat] Come on, musicians. Stand to your feet with me. You want to hear this from the seventh seal? &gt;&gt; Boy, that's a important sermon. &gt;&gt; Seventh seal was probably perhaps the most important sermon in 2,000 years since Paul was preaching at Ephesus. Brother Brandham says, "I thank him, thanking God, of course, for Jesus Christ." Now, listen. Listen to these words. I was going to put it up, but I decided not to. Just want you to listen. I thank him for Jesus Christ. For without sending him for the propitiation of our sins, we'd all be in a big muck of sin with no hope. &gt;&gt; But by his grace, his blood cleanses all sin. Just like the DROP OF INK IN A BUCKET OF CLOROX, you'd never find the that ink again. When our sins are confessed, it's put in the blood of Jesus Christ. They'll never be known again. I just say, "Blessed be the name of the Lord." They'll never be known again. &gt;&gt; God I didn't even know this could happen till a prophet said it. God forgets them. &gt;&gt; They They never was even done. Look at your neighbor and say, "God forgot all my sins." You chickens, you bunch of cowards, look at your neighbor and say, "God forgot all my sins." &gt;&gt; Where's your confidence? God forgot all my sins. &gt;&gt; They never was even done. Turn around and shake hands and say, "They never was even done." Come on, Bethl. They never was even done. I want to see lips moving. They never was even done. Listen, you couldn't say this. If a prophet hadn't said it, you wouldn't have the authority. That's an that's an audacious statement. THE AUDACITY TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT. NOW, IT'S PERFECTLY IN LINE with Paul's teaching, but Paul never said it so so poignantly, so succinctly. It God forgets them. They never was even done. As long as that sacrifice is laying there in an atonement for us, then that's all. That's it. We're not sinners no more. Hallelujah. [laughter] We're Christians by the grace of God. Remember? Remember, in our OWN SELVES, WE'D PROBABLY be just as bad as we ever was. But see, the grace of God has appeared to us and that's what has made us [music] what we are today. Christian brothers and sisters, God bless you, Christian brothers and sisters. I HOPE YOU'VE GOT gained a little bit of insight today on this on this nuts and bolts [music] type of sermon. Listen friends, this is this is this will what give you it's what will give you victory [music] on a daily basis. I don't know about you, but I covet that. I want that more in my life. I don't care about riches and fortune and [music] glory. I want to be victorious in Christ. Amen. Great is the measure of [music] our father's love. Think about it now. Oh, think about his blood. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, think about his goodness. Think about his grace [music] that he's brought us through. For [music] as high as the heavens above &gt;&gt; so much. &gt;&gt; Great [music] is the measure [singing] of our father's love. Oh, [music] great. Great is the measure of our father's love. [music] &gt;&gt; Think about his [singing] love. Come on now. [music] &gt;&gt; Think about his goodness. Think about [singing] his grace that he's brought [music] us through. &gt;&gt; Think about that. For as [music and singing] high as the heavens above, so great [music] is the measure of [singing] our father's love. [music] &gt;&gt; So great, great is the measure [singing] of our [music] father's love. Oh, [singing] think about his love. &gt;&gt; I want to think about it today. Think [music] about his [singing] goodness. &gt;&gt; Think about his grace that [music] he's brought us through. Let me have my ministry team. My ministry team for as high as the heavens above. So [music] great is [singing] the measure of our heart. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, great. &gt;&gt; Great is the measure of &gt;&gt; Allah. &gt;&gt; Brother Jack, come on up here with us. We're going to pray over Brother Brad getting ready to head to Honduras. Probably in my mind when you're going to a youth camp, there is so much [music] value in that because you're shaping and winning the hearts and minds of young people who are the chief target of the enemy and you're winning the hearts and minds of young people for Christ. How many will join with us and pray for our brother [music] that the Lord will go before him, go before him, prepare the way, defeat every, let every enemy that sees him approaching howl and faint. Amen. Let's believe it that way. Brother Jack is here and uh I've I've held this over my heart the whole time [music] praying this for our sister Kathy. I've just been praying for her every day. And brother Jack and I were talking this morning. He told me [music] she wanted me to have this and preach with it. I said, "Brother Jack, let it be. Let it be that that the anointing of the Holy Spirit [music] will be upon it and that her faith and confidence in the ministry, God will honor that." Do you believe that? Brother Jack, put your hand right there. All all together here. Father, in the name of Jesus [music] Christ, we pray for our brother Brad as he goes forward. Lord, he's going into the missionary field, Lord. We commit him now into [music] your hands. We commit his family and his home in his absence. Lord, may those services be [music] dynamic and powerfilled. May the enemy be defeated, Lord. May the enemy be [music] completely obliterated from the hearts and minds of those young people, Lord. May there be great victory in the camp. May [music] there be perfect faith in the word that is delivered. May you anoint our brother to know the words that he must speak. May you grant it, Lord. We commit him into your hands. Master, [music] we're all with our hands upon this prayer cloth for our sister Kathy. In the name of the son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ. [music] We send forth this prayer. We pray over this handkerchief. It was under over my heart the whole sermon under your anointing. Lord, let it be that when it lays upon her body, the enemy WILL GET SCARED AND RUN FOR THE HILLS, LORD. AND MAY OUR SISTER KNOW PERFECT FREEDOM THROUGHOUT HER BODY, may she I'm going to ask big. MAY SHE BE MADE COMPLETELY WHOLE. May her health RETURN TO HER IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS [music] CHRIST. &gt;&gt; So be it, Lord God. We commit it to you in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, brother Jack. [music] Thank you, my brothers. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. What you saying, Tony? [music] &gt;&gt; I need you right now. [music] &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I need you. &gt;&gt; I [singing] need you, Lord. How we need you &gt;&gt; right now. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's raise up our hands before we go now. [singing] &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We need you, Lord.
