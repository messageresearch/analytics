[32:16] character genesis chapter
[32:20] 32 familiar uh scripture here
[32:24] and we're going to get to this lord
[32:27] willing
[32:28] if we come to it and our we'll get to
[32:30] our text our opening text is going to be
[32:33] different than what we start off with
[32:34] but that's all right
[32:36] very familiar with jacob and the life of
[32:38] jacob
[32:39] and we just want to pick up just here at
[32:41] verse let's move on down to verse
[32:43] 24. and jacob was left alone
[32:49] and there wrestled a man with him until
[32:51] the breaking of the day
[32:52] and when he saw that he prevailed not
[32:54] against him he touched the hollow of his
[32:57] thigh
[32:57] and the hollow of jacob's thigh was out
[32:59] of joint you could mute this pulpit mike
[33:01] brother brad
[33:02] you mute this one and just have me here
[33:04] let's read that again
[33:06] verse 25 and when he saw that he
[33:07] prevailed not against him
[33:09] he touched the hollow of his thigh and
[33:11] the hollow of jacob's thigh was out of
[33:13] joint
[33:14] as he wrestled with him and he said let
[33:17] me go
[33:17] for the day breaketh and he said i will
[33:19] not let thee go
[33:21] except thou bless me and he said unto
[33:24] him
[33:24] what is thy name and he said jacob
[33:27] and he said thy name shall called thy
[33:30] name shall be called no more jacob
[33:33] but israel for as a prince has thou
[33:36] power with god
[33:37] and with men and has prevailed
[33:40] and jacob asked him and said tell me i
[33:43] pray thee
[33:44] thy name and he said wherefore is it
[33:46] that thou dost ask after my name
[33:49] and he blessed him there and jacob
[33:51] called the name of the place penile
[33:53] for i have seen god face to face and my
[33:57] life
[33:57] is preserved and as he passed over
[34:00] penile the sun rose upon him
[34:03] and he halted upon his thigh therefore
[34:06] the children of israel ate not of the
[34:07] sinu which shrank which is upon the
[34:09] hollow of the thigh and to this day
[34:12] because he touched the hollow of jacob's
[34:14] thigh
[34:15] in the sinew that shrank amen let's just
[34:18] look at one more scripture romans 8
[34:20] before you're seated
[34:21] i'll just read one more then have you be
[34:24] seated romans 8 28.
[34:26] very familiar favorite bible verse for
[34:29] some romans 8 28.
[34:31] let's read this in verse 29 and we know
[34:34] that all things
[34:35] work together for good to them that love
[34:38] god
[34:39] to them who are the called according to
[34:42] his purpose
[34:44] for whom he did for no he also did
[34:47] predestinate to be
[34:48] conformed to the image of his son
[34:51] that he might be the firstborn among
[34:54] many brethren
[34:55] let's just bow our heads here just to
[34:57] ask god to bless the word lord
[34:59] father we've read these words lord and
[35:01] i've believed that
[35:03] you've given me an anointing and unction
[35:06] lord you've stirred my heart in a
[35:07] certain direction
[35:08] lord and i believe that's for somebody
[35:10] here tonight
[35:12] maybe lord even those that are streaming
[35:15] that couldn't be here
[35:16] those that'll listen to this later lord
[35:18] by way of archive
[35:19] we just right now lord raise our hands
[35:21] and surrender
[35:23] lord as a sign of surrender to say we're
[35:25] giving it to you now
[35:27] all things lord everything that we that
[35:30] we do everything let it be done for your
[35:32] glory
[35:33] everything that is said lord let it be
[35:34] for your glory lord i pray that you
[35:36] would come and take control now
[35:39] father and move beyond the realms of
[35:41] mortal men
[35:43] lord and move into that realm of the
[35:44] soul where real change can happen
[35:47] that's our desire lord for every person
[35:49] that's here may you grant it now to us
[35:52] lord we ask in jesus name
[35:54] amen you can be seated
[35:58] amen preaching on messiah character
[36:02] and i have a powerpoint that we'll show
[36:04] here in just a moment you don't have to
[36:05] put that up yet
[36:07] going to take just a minute to get to it
[36:09] some of what we're going to start just
[36:10] to lay a foundation
[36:12] we'll be real familiar to some of you
[36:14] that were
[36:15] part of the sunday school that we took a
[36:17] few weeks back
[36:18] on abraham isaac and jacob the god of
[36:21] abraham isaac and jacob and some of it
[36:24] will be
[36:25] very familiar to you you'll find a
[36:27] strand when you study the bible
[36:30] or i could call it a thread that you'll
[36:33] find
[36:33] two threads running through the bible
[36:35] especially in the whole of the entire
[36:37] old testament and that thread is very
[36:41] simple
[36:41] and that is that god calls himself the
[36:44] god of
[36:45] jacob abraham isaac and jacob
[36:49] now it's interesting because man doesn't
[36:52] do abraham nor isaac nor jacob
[36:55] came up with this phrase or got together
[36:59] and and came up with a name for god but
[37:02] god is actually by saying this
[37:04] is identifying himself with
[37:07] a family a specific family
[37:11] a father a son and a grandfather
[37:14] and god identifies himself with this one
[37:18] family and their every nation in the old
[37:21] testament
[37:22] uh would be identified or they would
[37:24] have their own god
[37:26] their own uh their own uh symbol
[37:29] the their their own signet uh that that
[37:32] they would be identified by
[37:34] you had nations that would i identify
[37:36] their national
[37:38] god as the god of bell you had nations
[37:41] that would nationally symbolize their
[37:43] god
[37:44] of moloch or whatever nation if it was a
[37:47] babylonian god of some sort of a
[37:50] starters or
[37:51] or or whatever it was they would
[37:54] identify themselves
[37:55] religiously with their own god and it
[37:58] was very important for those nations
[38:01] that they symbolize themself because
[38:04] it was it was a symbol of power
[38:08] it was a symbol of who fought for them
[38:10] and when they would come to war
[38:12] there was a religious aspect behind the
[38:15] war
[38:16] the battle that you would even see
[38:18] sometimes uh the battles even some of
[38:20] them i
[38:20] read two of them uh here that i won't
[38:23] take the time to read here but
[38:25] it was the entire war was a religious
[38:29] war it was a religious battle
[38:31] and so israel was a nation just like the
[38:34] other nations
[38:36] in the world and israel was identified
[38:39] religiously
[38:40] signifying that their god was jehovah
[38:43] and he was considered by all of the
[38:45] nations to be the god of
[38:47] israel we talk about the nation of
[38:50] america that were founded upon
[38:52] judeo-christian values and that we're a
[38:55] christian nation what is it we're
[38:58] attaching ourself to
[39:00] a belief system or a world view
[39:03] or a way that you look at perspective
[39:06] that you look
[39:06] upon life of of how your your opinions
[39:09] are molded and so
[39:11] israel was looked at as the god or the
[39:14] god of israel was looked at
[39:16] as jehovah but israel had something very
[39:20] different than the other nations you see
[39:22] israel was not just claiming to have a
[39:24] god like
[39:26] the gods of the hittites or the
[39:27] perizzites or the babylonians
[39:30] but israel was making something a far
[39:32] greater claim than just a god but israel
[39:34] was claiming that our god
[39:36] is the god of all gods
[39:40] and in fact further than that israel was
[39:42] saying he's not just the god of all gods
[39:45] he's the only god he's the only real god
[39:48] the only true god the only god that
[39:51] really
[39:52] exists they went further than that and
[39:55] said and
[39:56] the also this god who we serve is the
[39:59] only god and he's the god of all gods
[40:01] and he's also
[40:02] the god who created the universe
[40:06] the god who created everything that sees
[40:08] everything that acts
[40:10] everything that moves everything that
[40:12] has breath
[40:13] was created by this one
[40:16] god and this one god just so
[40:20] happens to associate himself
[40:23] with us
[40:26] it starts to make sense why they became
[40:28] a target and an enemy you see when you
[40:30] say something like that
[40:32] people want to pick on you and want to
[40:33] challenge what you believe
[40:36] and so you find this in isaiah the
[40:38] chapter 40. we won't read it here i got
[40:39] the notations we'll just skip over these
[40:41] you'll find it also in the book of job
[40:43] you'll find it in the book of psalms
[40:45] this that you are the god of all gods
[40:48] and the other so so you'll find this as
[40:51] we said these two threads one thread
[40:53] coming through the scriptures but the
[40:55] other thread that you'll find
[40:57] is that the god of the whole universe
[41:00] one thread that you'll find is that the
[41:02] god of the jews
[41:04] are claiming the god of the universe and
[41:07] you'll also find a thread very true
[41:09] that the god of the universe is the god
[41:12] of the jews
[41:14] and they were actually they were really
[41:17] claiming
[41:18] that the creator of everything that is
[41:20] the stars the galaxies
[41:23] had actually made a very personal
[41:27] intimate relationship
[41:31] with not all humanity not just the
[41:35] entire world
[41:36] not all that's living and breathing but
[41:39] israel said
[41:40] that god has created and attached
[41:43] himself to
[41:44] one small tiny group of people
[41:50] it's a big claim
[41:53] anybody can claim it anybody could have
[41:55] said it
[41:56] but it would take god to back it up
[42:00] that the god of the universe the god of
[42:03] the
[42:04] galaxies had became the god of the jews
[42:08] and he was calling himself the god
[42:12] of abraham isaac and jacob
[42:17] imagine the god of abraham
[42:21] a grandfather isaac a father
[42:24] jacob a grandfather a father and a
[42:27] son that the god of the entire universe
[42:30] could you imagine the reaction or the
[42:32] ire that it drew
[42:34] from the rest of the world could you
[42:37] imagine the
[42:38] it was an incredible claim but what you
[42:40] understand
[42:42] uh these two threads you know if you
[42:44] read just read the book of genesis
[42:46] because the book of genesis covers all
[42:48] of this the god of jacob
[42:49] the god of abraham isaac and jacob and
[42:52] and let me just move through some of
[42:54] these notes just to save time because we
[42:55] got so much more
[42:56] but we just i want to lay this
[42:58] foundation uh
[43:00] very clearly and so what you find is if
[43:03] you
[43:03] and it's it's amazing because the the
[43:06] book of genesis let me cover this
[43:08] without genesis without the book of
[43:10] genesis you would have no ground
[43:12] for that claim at all if the bible if
[43:14] you opened your bible up
[43:16] and you missed the book of genesis and
[43:18] you didn't have the beginning
[43:20] then you started with the book of exodus
[43:22] imagine how much you would miss
[43:24] you would get a dialogue and a story but
[43:27] no basis
[43:28] for that story at all but what you what
[43:31] you understand
[43:32] is is that genesis says that
[43:35] the genesis is the book that says
[43:38] the god of the jews is the god of the
[43:41] universe
[43:42] and the god of the universe is the god
[43:44] of the jews now remember the book of
[43:46] genesis covers
[43:47] more time than the whole rest of the
[43:50] bible put together
[43:52] one book covers more years
[43:56] in time than the rest of the entire
[43:59] bible put together if you were to
[44:01] calculate all of the
[44:02] years and the months and the days
[44:06] of coverage that one book covers
[44:10] more incredible and so from
[44:13] exodus to the last bit of revelation
[44:17] you have about 1500 years
[44:21] of time exodus to revelation
[44:25] about 1500 years whereas
[44:28] genesis covers
[44:31] all the way from the beginning of the
[44:34] world
[44:37] all of creation all the days of creation
[44:41] and we don't exactly even know how many
[44:43] years or how many exact days or how many
[44:45] exact months that covers
[44:47] it covers a massive span from the
[44:50] history of the world from beginning
[44:52] right through all the way to joseph
[44:56] which is much longer than 1500 years
[45:00] so what you realize is that when you
[45:02] read your bible and you read
[45:04] the book of genesis you're not reading
[45:06] it like a day
[45:07] this is december and then over here's uh
[45:10] october and over here is november
[45:12] this is the the year over here you're
[45:14] not reading it like year after year
[45:15] after year chronologically
[45:17] but actually time has been compressed
[45:20] into just a little bitty tiny uh
[45:23] uh increment just a little bitty tiny
[45:26] slot
[45:27] of compressed time it covers
[45:30] many many centuries
[45:34] as compared to the entire rest of the
[45:36] bible
[45:37] it's a longer period of time and so
[45:40] chapter 1 through chapter 11 when you
[45:42] read genesis 1 and all the way through
[45:44] chapter 11
[45:45] is a very short which you'd call only 11
[45:47] chapters
[45:48] but it covers a massive a very short
[45:52] section but covers a
[45:53] massive amount of time centuries and
[45:57] many peoples and it talks about many
[45:59] nations and
[46:00] the entire forming of the world and the
[46:02] forming of culture and
[46:03] the forming of societies and and cities
[46:06] and
[46:07] kingdoms and all of that happens in just
[46:10] 11 chapters of your bible just
[46:12] compressed like this
[46:13] so there's no way to get every single
[46:14] detail there's no way to get every
[46:16] single story
[46:17] but it compresses it down over many
[46:20] centuries and many people
[46:22] and many nations but then when you go to
[46:24] chapter 12
[46:26] and you read genesis 12 through genesis
[46:29] 50.
[46:30] that's many more chapters 12 through 50.
[46:33] a much longer section of your bible but
[46:36] you know it actually only covers a
[46:38] very short space of time
[46:42] just a little space and i'm pointing
[46:44] this out because it's gonna it's gonna
[46:46] it's gonna mean something it was amazing
[46:48] to me
[46:49] when you go to chapter 12 and you have
[46:51] 13 14
[46:52] 15 16. now chapter 1 through 11 is just
[46:55] blazing
[46:56] through time but then when you come to
[46:58] chapter 12
[47:00] it's almost like time just
[47:03] zeros in
[47:07] on one family
[47:10] on a man named abraham and then when god
[47:13] comes to abraham
[47:14] the whole bible slows down wow
[47:17] and you come through isaac and it's
[47:19] still at that same slow pace
[47:21] you come through jacob you come through
[47:23] all the way through to joseph
[47:24] why because god was saying there's going
[47:27] to be a
[47:28] great emphasis because all of redemption
[47:32] and all of
[47:33] history is going to come through this
[47:36] man
[47:36] and his family and this plan for the
[47:39] rest of the entire world
[47:42] it's a very deliberate zooming
[47:45] from the entire great grand stage of
[47:48] history
[47:49] and all of the people and all of the
[47:50] nations and all of the
[47:52] kindreds and why couldn't god cover all
[47:54] of it because it wasn't going to be
[47:56] about all of it it was going to be about
[47:59] one
[48:00] purpose by one god
[48:03] to one family amen
[48:07] you're seeing history from god's point
[48:11] of view
[48:12] it's incredible because god's a god of
[48:14] variety and if you didn't have
[48:16] even the different authors of the bible
[48:18] were all different men and thought very
[48:20] differently
[48:21] you look at the gospels matthew thought
[48:23] differently than mark and mark thought
[48:25] differently than luke and luke thought
[48:27] differently than even john
[48:28] and brother branham even said that the
[48:31] different gospels
[48:32] had a different anointing and he typed
[48:34] those creatures from the book of
[48:36] revelations the
[48:37] the lion and the ox and the eagle and
[48:39] the man
[48:40] and brother branham said that each one
[48:42] of those books had a different anointing
[48:44] upon it because god was a god of variety
[48:47] they all had a different perspective
[48:49] there's a lot of people who claim that
[48:51] there's contradiction
[48:52] you know that one account and there
[48:54] actually is there's quite a bit of
[48:55] of contradiction that if you don't work
[48:58] out it's not that there's contradiction
[49:00] that they contradict each other so one's
[49:01] true and
[49:02] and you know from from the skeptic's
[49:04] point of view you know you can't use the
[49:06] bible for
[49:07] a a you know an accurate p a historical
[49:10] record because of the inconsistencies
[49:12] but are the contradictions but what is
[49:14] it it's a different it's not a
[49:16] contradiction
[49:17] it's seeing the same story from a
[49:19] different perspective
[49:20] or different point of view or a
[49:22] different way and they're let me say
[49:24] this they have a different
[49:26] purpose the message of matthew and the
[49:28] message of mark have a different
[49:30] emphasis there's a different point they
[49:32] were many different authors because
[49:34] god's a big god of variety do you know
[49:37] what the difference was there was many
[49:39] authors
[49:40] but there was only one editor and that
[49:42] editor was jesus
[49:44] christ the editor of matthew mark luke
[49:46] and john was the same one who wrote
[49:48] genesis
[49:50] the same one who spoke the world into
[49:52] existence
[49:54] and so even the book of john it's
[49:56] incredible i was studying this just this
[49:58] afternoon
[49:59] it's incredible because brother branham
[50:01] says that even the book of john
[50:03] was under that eagle anointing
[50:06] it was it's what was john john was even
[50:09] in the book of revelations
[50:10] john being a type of the bride and so so
[50:13] we know that
[50:15] that there's a there's a different phase
[50:17] you could say it this way
[50:19] that there was a different phase there's
[50:21] even i
[50:22] read a statement earlier that said an
[50:24] interest
[50:25] in a a important person takes
[50:29] three different phases and when you want
[50:31] to find out about an
[50:32] important person there will be three
[50:34] different um
[50:35] uh forget what he called i think he
[50:37] called it phases or depths
[50:39] of of curiosity and if you have depth
[50:42] number one just a
[50:44] a surface level interest in a person
[50:47] uh phase one is that you want to you're
[50:51] interested in what
[50:52] that person did what did they accomplish
[50:55] what did they do in their life i want to
[50:57] know about them
[50:58] and so tell me what they did and so the
[51:01] book of matthew
[51:02] tells you all about what jesus did tells
[51:05] you all about the miracles
[51:07] uh it goes into detail about everything
[51:09] that he did
[51:10] you go further and he said then you go
[51:12] into a further level
[51:14] of interest in that person and you don't
[51:16] just want to know what he did
[51:18] but you want to know what did he say
[51:21] amen
[51:22] and so you read his books and you read
[51:24] his writings and you get his
[51:26] you you want to find out not just what
[51:27] he did but you want to find out what did
[51:29] he say
[51:30] but then he said but then there's a
[51:32] third depth and it's only the deepest
[51:35] curiosity that'll reach this depth is
[51:38] not just what he did and not just what
[51:40] he said but you want to know
[51:42] who he was you want to know
[51:46] what he was and and i just thought that
[51:48] was wonderful because you know a lot of
[51:50] people are curious about what did jesus
[51:52] do
[51:53] and that's as far as their depth of
[51:55] christianity ever comes to
[51:57] it's just learning and reading about
[51:59] what he did what he did
[52:01] and the miracles that he performed some
[52:03] people go further and they're interested
[52:05] in what did he have to say
[52:06] what did he teach but i believe that to
[52:09] a real believer
[52:10] it's good to know what he did it's good
[52:12] to know what he said
[52:13] but you say lord i want to know who are
[52:16] you
[52:16] what are you today lord reveal yourself
[52:19] to me
[52:19] personally in a personal way
[52:23] and even the book of john covers not so
[52:25] much about what he did it's amazing
[52:28] under that eagle anointing it was it was
[52:30] because it was specific
[52:32] to the bride that it wasn't just what he
[52:34] did did you know that there's no mention
[52:36] in the book of john
[52:37] about the conception or the birth of
[52:39] jesus
[52:41] interesting there's no mention these are
[52:44] just
[52:45] amazing what was omitted in the book of
[52:48] john knows it was
[52:49] omitted because john didn't believe in
[52:50] it no it had nothing to do with that
[52:53] matthew covered it mark it was a was it
[52:55] omitted because
[52:56] john felt like it was covered uh uh
[52:59] enough uh in
[53:00] by other writers no it was that you
[53:02] understand the emphasis or the reason
[53:05] why
[53:05] john was writing there was a point there
[53:08] was
[53:08] an attention there was an attraction
[53:11] there was something that he was trying
[53:13] to say
[53:14] and it didn't cover his birth it didn't
[53:16] cover his baptism
[53:18] no mention of really of his of the
[53:20] temptations and the wilderness
[53:22] there's no mentions of casting out of
[53:23] demons the
[53:25] mount transfiguration uh is omitted no
[53:28] mention of the last
[53:29] supper uh no the bread turning and the
[53:31] wine no mention of gethsemane
[53:33] no mention of the ascension did you know
[53:35] that that's not in the book of john
[53:39] you say brother matt was it because it
[53:40] wasn't important no it was because it
[53:42] was a
[53:42] zoomed in scoped in image of not just
[53:46] what he did
[53:47] or what he said but who he was
[53:52] say how's that how does that connect to
[53:54] what you're preaching on because
[53:56] because it's not what is what does john
[54:00] cover not just what he did but his
[54:02] character
[54:03] of who he was it's one thing brother
[54:06] branham said it's one thing to know
[54:08] about him
[54:09] it's another thing to know him and paul
[54:12] said to know him as
[54:13] life and brother adam like he argues
[54:15] with the man and says well you don't
[54:16] know your bible it says i may not know
[54:18] my bible but i know the author very well
[54:22] so it was about knowing his character
[54:25] it's about knowing
[54:26] who he was it's a zooming in listen to
[54:29] this
[54:30] what the prophet of god says and i
[54:31] didn't have i didn't get this on the
[54:33] screen so just listen
[54:34] closely now jesus listen to what brother
[54:37] adam says here
[54:38] jesus gave us the example of what we
[54:41] ought to be looking at
[54:43] when he jesus gave us the example
[54:47] of what we ought to be looking at when
[54:50] he reflected his life
[54:52] to us through the word what we should
[54:55] see
[54:56] when we look into god's mirror that's
[54:59] the bible that's his word
[55:01] we should see ourselves identified
[55:05] with him amen that is a perfect example
[55:10] that's what brother adam says that is a
[55:12] perfect example
[55:15] you see it's one thing to look at his
[55:17] life
[55:19] and to look at the ways and to look at
[55:21] his acts and to look at his reactions
[55:24] and to say oh my what a what a w
[55:27] what character he had what humility
[55:32] what what surrender to the father that
[55:34] he had brother branham says but when you
[55:36] look at it
[55:37] you should be able to see yourself you
[55:40] see that
[55:41] brings an entire other dynamic the one
[55:43] thing just to ooh and
[55:44] ah over the life of jesus and what a
[55:46] perfect lamb and what a perfect
[55:48] sacrifice
[55:49] oh but when god really reveals himself
[55:51] to you the prophet said you should put
[55:53] yourself there
[55:54] and say lord let that character be
[55:56] reflected through my life
[56:00] and he says that character listen to
[56:02] what he says here he says but now
[56:04] but we find out as we go along through
[56:06] life now i read this
[56:07] last sunday he says we we go along
[56:09] through life
[56:10] that our character molds us
[56:13] molds the image that we are each one
[56:17] knows that your character
[56:18] molds you to what you are now you've
[56:22] seen people that you just love to be
[56:24] around
[56:24] they might not exactly be in your
[56:26] bracket of society and they may be a
[56:28] different race
[56:29] they may be uh from a different country
[56:31] there's just listen to what he's saying
[56:33] so that
[56:33] maybe a different race maybe maybe even
[56:35] they speak a different language
[56:36] as we spoke of last time might not even
[56:39] speak your
[56:40] your language very well and he says but
[56:42] there's just something
[56:43] about them something about that
[56:47] character that you just love to be in
[56:49] their presence
[56:51] i love to be around believers amen i
[56:54] love to be around christians
[56:57] why why is it is it because we can
[57:00] converse and we're like
[57:02] you know social buddies and we could
[57:03] talk about what we know about the word
[57:05] or
[57:05] how much you know how much i know has
[57:07] nothing to do with that
[57:09] you may not even talk about any
[57:11] scripture verse but there's just some
[57:12] communion that you
[57:14] have when you're around another believer
[57:17] it's the character of christ and he says
[57:22] he says but there's just something about
[57:23] that character because each person
[57:26] is a little dynamo of their own and you
[57:29] put out an atmosphere then you see
[57:32] people that were noble people
[57:35] he says you see people that were noble
[57:37] people but yet
[57:38] you were always glad to get away from
[57:41] them
[57:43] it's just that they create such an
[57:46] atmosphere around where you
[57:47] are nothing against them they're nice
[57:50] people
[57:51] but you just don't like that atmosphere
[57:54] they're
[57:55] in and their character
[57:58] creates now you say brother matt what is
[58:01] that is it is something against the
[58:02] individual has nothing to do with the
[58:04] person
[58:05] as brother adam says you may have
[58:06] nothing against them they might have
[58:08] done nothing to you
[58:09] but just something contradicts with
[58:12] something inside of you
[58:14] and something inside of them amen it
[58:17] isn't that you just avoid there are
[58:18] certain people that you should avoid
[58:20] absolutely
[58:21] light has what fellowship does light
[58:22] have with darkness even
[58:24] even jesus speaks of that the apostle
[58:26] paul speaks of that
[58:27] you know that that you don't don't let
[58:29] yourself be entangled again with the
[58:31] yoke of bondage
[58:33] but he says there's certain people it
[58:35] isn't that you avoid them it's just
[58:37] something
[58:38] contradictory there that you know what
[58:40] is that brother man
[58:41] it's the character of christ in you
[58:44] and the character of christ in another
[58:46] person that brings an attraction
[58:49] to where brother brother branham said
[58:51] they're a little dynamo they put off
[58:53] an atmosphere they put off a certain
[58:56] atmosphere what atmosphere it's the
[58:58] atmosphere of christ
[59:00] it's the atmosphere of jehovah it's not
[59:02] them it's not their
[59:03] human atmosphere because those same
[59:06] believers can get
[59:07] in their own flesh and we all can get in
[59:10] our own flesh
[59:12] and we can create our own stinky
[59:14] atmosphere
[59:15] amen where no one wants to be here trust
[59:18] me
[59:19] i can get in a certain mood you don't
[59:21] want to be around me
[59:23] just ask my wife or my children if you
[59:26] don't believe her
[59:28] you say you brother matt all of us we
[59:31] can get in that we can get in our own
[59:33] self and
[59:34] and create our own human atmosphere and
[59:36] our own it has nothing to do with us
[59:38] has nothing to do with you or how nice
[59:40] you are how intellectual you are
[59:42] but when you've submitted your life and
[59:44] you have the character of christ
[59:47] it attracts the rest of the body of
[59:49] christ
[59:50] it sends off a little dynamo a little
[59:53] atmosphere
[59:55] i say god let me project that kind of
[59:59] christ-like spirit and he says listen to
[1:00:02] this he says
[1:00:03] now with our message can we different
[1:00:06] place here he says
[1:00:07] can we stand by the looking glass of
[1:00:10] god's word
[1:00:11] right here we have god's word can we
[1:00:13] stand by the looking glass of god's word
[1:00:16] and see christ reflect
[1:00:20] in our own lives can we bear such of the
[1:00:24] reproach
[1:00:24] of the message that we're standing for
[1:00:26] here someone say
[1:00:28] something about it and yet you just
[1:00:31] don't open your mouth and say nothing
[1:00:34] about it
[1:00:35] he was the example because god was
[1:00:38] reflecting his
[1:00:40] character in him and then if we're sons
[1:00:44] and daughters of god
[1:00:45] god reflects his character in us
[1:00:49] than we become like him
[1:00:53] that's my heart's desire i think that's
[1:00:56] every believer's
[1:00:57] desire is to become more like him
[1:01:00] amen no other nature could do this no
[1:01:03] because he was the moted perfect
[1:01:06] character of god for
[1:01:10] it was a fallen character that all
[1:01:12] nature had
[1:01:13] that's what romans chapter 3 says that
[1:01:16] the creation was made
[1:01:17] subject to vanity and he says it was the
[1:01:21] nature
[1:01:22] it was the fallen character that all
[1:01:24] nature had all men
[1:01:26] had a fallen character even everything
[1:01:28] that was
[1:01:29] under man fell everything has got a
[1:01:32] dying character
[1:01:34] and he but he jesus who's he jesus
[1:01:37] had a living character so he expressed
[1:01:40] it in christ
[1:01:41] and he paid the price and then because
[1:01:43] of his obedience he raised him up on the
[1:01:45] third day
[1:01:46] that gives to us the proof it gives to
[1:01:49] us
[1:01:50] the assurance that as long as we're
[1:01:53] in him we're already risen with him
[1:01:57] listen here i wish i had this on the
[1:01:59] screen we're all invited
[1:02:01] to shape our own character to his by his
[1:02:03] grace
[1:02:04] we are invited think of it to become
[1:02:07] characters like
[1:02:08] his if we're ready to lay our
[1:02:12] character down amen
[1:02:16] we're invited to have his
[1:02:19] if we're willing to lay our character
[1:02:22] down amen he says
[1:02:26] and the molding that we had heady
[1:02:30] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:02:32] lovers of god
[1:02:33] false accusers incontinent despisers of
[1:02:36] those that are trying to do right
[1:02:38] having a form of godliness we've got to
[1:02:41] take
[1:02:41] the entire full gospel listen
[1:02:44] and now being that we are identified
[1:02:46] ourselves with as full
[1:02:48] gospel people let's mode our character
[1:02:50] we're invited
[1:02:52] to be molded in his image that we might
[1:02:55] reflect
[1:02:56] his presence jesus says the works that i
[1:03:00] do shall you do
[1:03:01] also how unless you have the character
[1:03:04] of jesus christ
[1:03:06] how can you do his works unless you have
[1:03:08] his character so our brother adam says
[1:03:10] if i had the spirit of beethoven i would
[1:03:12] write music if i
[1:03:13] had the spirit of john dillinger i'd pad
[1:03:15] i'd
[1:03:16] i'd i'd have guns he says but if i'd
[1:03:18] have the he said if but if i have the
[1:03:19] spirit of christ
[1:03:21] i'd have the character of christ and if
[1:03:24] i had the character of christ i'd have
[1:03:25] the works of christ
[1:03:27] many want the works they they want to
[1:03:30] bypass the character
[1:03:31] amen and he says
[1:03:34] then we let he says to take him let me
[1:03:38] read this
[1:03:38] and he says the life that i live shall
[1:03:40] you live we're invited to
[1:03:41] by god to take him as an example and let
[1:03:45] our character be
[1:03:46] molded like his
[1:03:50] have many more we could read would have
[1:03:51] saved time here
[1:03:54] abraham isaac and jacob were all three
[1:03:56] men that god
[1:03:58] chose to identify himself
[1:04:01] by one family with abraham god begins
[1:04:05] his entire program he deals with the
[1:04:07] entire human race
[1:04:09] the whole of history is zoomed in
[1:04:12] to this one family this one man
[1:04:15] god zooms in and stops time time slows
[1:04:18] down
[1:04:19] to this one man abraham and god begins
[1:04:23] his program
[1:04:24] chooses his plan we we talked about this
[1:04:27] a lot in the sunday school we taught on
[1:04:29] the scandal of particularity
[1:04:31] of how that god chose one family one
[1:04:34] nation
[1:04:34] why didn't he just bring a savior for
[1:04:36] the chinese to save the chinese
[1:04:38] he could have brought a russian to save
[1:04:40] the russians but what did he do he chose
[1:04:43] a jew
[1:04:44] to save the rest of the world
[1:04:47] one family to save to save the rest
[1:04:50] of the world uh one two poets
[1:04:54] one is called women norman oor and one's
[1:04:57] called cecil brown
[1:04:58] they both wrote very short just short
[1:05:00] little one-liner poems i read this last
[1:05:02] time i thought it was so good
[1:05:04] one little liner poems and william
[1:05:06] norman uh wrote this poem
[1:05:08] it's very popular uh with the scandal of
[1:05:11] particularity
[1:05:12] and his poem was very simple and it was
[1:05:15] just this
[1:05:16] how odd of god to choose
[1:05:19] the jews nice and catchy right
[1:05:24] how odd of god to choose
[1:05:28] the jews so alone came a man named cecil
[1:05:31] brown
[1:05:32] and he decided to write a second verse
[1:05:34] and the second verse went like this
[1:05:36] but not so odd as those who
[1:05:39] choose a jewish god but spurned the jews
[1:05:46] but not so odd as those who choose
[1:05:50] a jewish god but spurn the jews
[1:05:54] it's amazing you say brother man why did
[1:05:57] god
[1:05:58] choose the jews let me give you a very
[1:06:01] simple answer because
[1:06:02] that was his choice
[1:06:06] amen and you can argue with it you may
[1:06:09] not like it you may try to explain it
[1:06:11] away
[1:06:12] but it was still his choice
[1:06:15] to call himself the god of abraham
[1:06:18] isaac and jacob amen
[1:06:22] so genesis as we said are basically 12
[1:06:25] through 50 are about these
[1:06:27] four men these different generations
[1:06:31] three generations
[1:06:32] of abraham isaac and jacob if you look
[1:06:34] at each one of these men there's a
[1:06:36] counterpart
[1:06:37] to each one of their lives abraham had a
[1:06:40] nephew
[1:06:40] his name was locked as a counterpoint
[1:06:43] abraham and lot you have
[1:06:45] isaac and the counterpart point to isaac
[1:06:48] as his
[1:06:49] stepbrother ishmael and then you have
[1:06:52] jacob and what's his counterpoint a twin
[1:06:56] amen esau you notice that you know pick
[1:06:59] that
[1:07:00] up how many it gets closer and closer
[1:07:02] and closer you go from nephew
[1:07:04] to stepbrother to twin amen
[1:07:10] in born of the same family the
[1:07:13] relationships get closer
[1:07:15] and closer and closer i say brother matt
[1:07:17] why is that important because it's
[1:07:19] showing that through the entire bible
[1:07:21] there is two lines
[1:07:22] running through the human race in very
[1:07:25] stark not a bloodline
[1:07:28] not a physical bloodline not of a
[1:07:30] certain race
[1:07:31] a certain color of skin or a certain
[1:07:33] ethnicity or
[1:07:35] nation that you were born or certain
[1:07:36] language that you speak
[1:07:38] but the two lines are one of obedience
[1:07:41] and one of disobedience one of light one
[1:07:43] of darkness
[1:07:44] one of faith one of one of intellectual
[1:07:46] faith and one of revelation
[1:07:48] amen there's two lines that run through
[1:07:51] the entire human race that
[1:07:53] stands in very stark contrast
[1:07:57] to each other and the entire bible is an
[1:08:00] invitation to identify your character
[1:08:03] with one or the other
[1:08:07] are you in abraham or are you a lot are
[1:08:10] you an isaac or are you an ishmael are
[1:08:12] you
[1:08:12] a jacob or are you an esau
[1:08:17] good question because these are the
[1:08:20] three men that god
[1:08:22] chose say i'm the god of abraham
[1:08:26] the god of isaac the god of jacob but
[1:08:29] yet when you
[1:08:30] zoom down unto the life of these
[1:08:33] three men what you would expect
[1:08:36] to see is perfection
[1:08:39] and beauty consistency
[1:08:42] solidity just a a a a a family
[1:08:46] men of great faith men of great exploits
[1:08:50] men of greatness but what you find is
[1:08:53] three
[1:08:54] very simple men who were ridden
[1:08:58] with mistakes and failures
[1:09:01] and hang-ups and issues
[1:09:04] and problems and lies and
[1:09:08] schemes and theft
[1:09:11] amen and these are the three that god
[1:09:15] says i'm the god of abraham
[1:09:17] isaac and jacob he said brother matt
[1:09:20] what did they have why would god choose
[1:09:22] them
[1:09:22] they weren't good men abraham uh we can
[1:09:25] go through the list of what abraham
[1:09:27] and his mistakes that he made go through
[1:09:29] the list of the mistakes that isaac made
[1:09:31] go through the list of some of what
[1:09:33] jacob was in so much that jacob had to
[1:09:35] get a name change
[1:09:37] because he was a screen he was a schemer
[1:09:40] but what was it
[1:09:41] it wasn't that they were good men then
[1:09:44] what separated them from the rest of the
[1:09:46] world
[1:09:47] it's because they were men who believed
[1:09:50] amen what is the true faith seed
[1:09:53] is it the the conduct or the behavior is
[1:09:56] so much greater than the rest of the
[1:09:58] world that god esteems them because
[1:09:59] they're conduct no
[1:10:01] it's because they have the ability to
[1:10:02] believe god
[1:10:04] abraham believed god and it was
[1:10:06] accounted unto him for righteousness
[1:10:08] jacob was a man you see god could do a
[1:10:12] lot
[1:10:13] more god could do more through a man who
[1:10:16] will believe than a good man
[1:10:18] wow amen because there's a lot of good
[1:10:21] people who are
[1:10:22] good but can't believe and if god can
[1:10:26] just
[1:10:26] get a man to believe it doesn't matter
[1:10:29] how
[1:10:30] good or how bad or how ugly he is if the
[1:10:33] man will just believe in god
[1:10:35] look at look at this even this one life
[1:10:39] turn back to genesis chapter 32 and
[1:10:42] and and we're just going to cover this
[1:10:44] just here for a moment
[1:10:46] a place where jacob comes to where he
[1:10:49] wrestles
[1:10:49] with the lord it's where he made it
[1:10:53] makes a total surrender to god
[1:10:56] it's where he gets his character not
[1:10:59] just his motive character
[1:11:01] but he's actually god is going to
[1:11:03] completely
[1:11:05] re-identify this man with a whole
[1:11:09] new name because what's it going to
[1:11:12] speak of that god is going to
[1:11:14] mold the character what's god after
[1:11:17] he says i if i can i don't need to we
[1:11:20] don't need to conform you we don't need
[1:11:22] to
[1:11:22] reform you to reform your works if but
[1:11:25] if we can
[1:11:26] conform you into the image that's why we
[1:11:28] read
[1:11:29] romans chapter 8 and it's such a good
[1:11:31] scripture it says
[1:11:33] and we know that all things work
[1:11:34] together for the good to them that love
[1:11:36] god to those who are called according to
[1:11:38] his purpose for whom he did for no he
[1:11:41] also did predestinate to be
[1:11:43] conformed to the image
[1:11:47] of his son conformed the character
[1:11:51] molded and jacob's going to come to this
[1:11:53] place where he has to surrender
[1:11:56] completely and get a new name
[1:11:59] it's the place where he casts down his
[1:12:02] last
[1:12:03] idol where he gets not just
[1:12:07] a victory but he gets the victory amen
[1:12:11] you know there's a very important place
[1:12:12] you've got to get to in your life where
[1:12:14] you don't just get a victory
[1:12:16] you get the victory and brother brandon
[1:12:19] preached on this and he preached on the
[1:12:20] v
[1:12:20] day when you really get a real victory
[1:12:23] in your life
[1:12:24] to where you live above sin brother matt
[1:12:26] do you still are you still tempted
[1:12:27] are you preaching on perfection no not
[1:12:30] preaching on that you'll never be
[1:12:31] perfected in this body
[1:12:32] but there is a place you can live above
[1:12:35] sin
[1:12:36] amen i'm so glad
[1:12:40] and he passes notice this place the name
[1:12:42] of this place genesis 32 if you could
[1:12:44] put that on the screen
[1:12:45] verse 22. let's just read one verse here
[1:12:48] genesis 32
[1:12:51] and verse 22 and he rose up
[1:12:55] that night and took his two wives
[1:12:58] to women's servants as 11 sons and he
[1:13:01] passed
[1:13:02] over the ford jaybuck i guess that's how
[1:13:05] you'd pronounce that word
[1:13:06] he passes go back there he passes over
[1:13:10] the ford jaybuck that jaybuck means
[1:13:14] a place of passing
[1:13:17] it's also stands for a struggle
[1:13:20] or it means to empty this is important
[1:13:24] god is going to pass you have jacob pass
[1:13:27] over the fort of jacob
[1:13:28] of jabec it means to empty yourself
[1:13:32] completely amen to empty yourself
[1:13:37] completely to be poured out
[1:13:42] to be poured out this is what jacob
[1:13:45] meant it's a place where god
[1:13:49] pours you out of yourself
[1:13:53] or you're poured out of yourself where
[1:13:55] you get out of the way of yourself
[1:13:58] where you empty out yourself a place of
[1:14:02] passing over
[1:14:05] and it's it's amazing because he comes
[1:14:08] to this place
[1:14:09] go to the next verse verse verse 23
[1:14:11] we'll just read it
[1:14:12] and he took them and sent them over the
[1:14:14] book and sent over
[1:14:16] that he had now jacob comes to this
[1:14:18] crisis in his life
[1:14:20] where he's he's got god behind him
[1:14:23] chasing him and he's got
[1:14:25] and he's a good up to this point he's a
[1:14:27] good man he's
[1:14:28] he's uh he's already matured a lot from
[1:14:31] the day that he deceives his brother and
[1:14:33] steals the birthright
[1:14:34] but but god has done many things and
[1:14:37] he's in this
[1:14:38] crisis of his life you know it's like a
[1:14:40] it's like for a believer
[1:14:42] you gotta we we you know you've got it
[1:14:44] you've got to come to this red sea
[1:14:46] experience where you come out of the
[1:14:48] world and we all
[1:14:50] come out of the world and we come out of
[1:14:52] egypt and then you
[1:14:53] have the crossing of jordan and jordan's
[1:14:56] like a type
[1:14:56] of of of of of uh a
[1:15:00] dying to yourself you come out of egypt
[1:15:03] you come out of the world
[1:15:04] and then jordan's a place of death
[1:15:07] where you die to yourself and you enter
[1:15:10] into the promised land
[1:15:12] you're baptized in the name of jesus you
[1:15:15] read your bible you pray you're in a
[1:15:17] relationship with the lord
[1:15:19] but jabec represents something different
[1:15:22] than jordan it represents something
[1:15:23] different than
[1:15:25] than the red sea it's a death or an
[1:15:28] emptying or a pouring out or a giving
[1:15:31] over as the prophet said
[1:15:33] a dying out of your own character
[1:15:36] amen to where you stop making excuses
[1:15:40] for who you
[1:15:41] are you know how many times i've we've
[1:15:44] made that excuse well that's just i just
[1:15:47] can't help it that's just the way that i
[1:15:48] am
[1:15:49] you know that's just how i was that's
[1:15:51] just how i just got this tendency
[1:15:53] you know you know what you know where
[1:15:54] you know what jabek does jabek
[1:15:56] that place of jabek empties you out of
[1:15:59] all of those excuses
[1:16:01] it empties you out of all of your own
[1:16:04] dynamo
[1:16:05] and all of your own self because you you
[1:16:08] see as
[1:16:09] as righteous as jacob had became up to
[1:16:11] this point
[1:16:13] we're using him for example because god
[1:16:15] identifies himself with this man
[1:16:18] i'm the god of abraham isaac and jacob
[1:16:20] but it wasn't going to be this jacob
[1:16:23] it wasn't going to be this this man who
[1:16:26] was
[1:16:26] who was had matured as we said he'd
[1:16:29] gotten
[1:16:30] a lot of victory let me just find the
[1:16:33] scripture that i was going to read even
[1:16:35] even one that i had
[1:16:36] i had read earlier where the bible says
[1:16:40] yes
[1:16:41] that that jacob look at verse 24
[1:16:44] go to go to the next verse and it says
[1:16:48] and jacob was left alone
[1:16:51] and there wrestled a man with him until
[1:16:53] the breaking
[1:16:54] of the day and jacob was left
[1:16:57] alone you know when you come to this
[1:17:00] place
[1:17:01] you're at the red sea you got all the
[1:17:03] crowds of people with you get all the
[1:17:05] cheering of the audience you got the
[1:17:07] prophet there
[1:17:08] you got everybody you got you got jordan
[1:17:11] what is it there you have the priest and
[1:17:13] there you have joshua
[1:17:15] but here it's just you and god
[1:17:18] wow that's when you wrestle
[1:17:21] you know jacob was really wrestling he
[1:17:23] wasn't really wrestling you know who the
[1:17:25] man
[1:17:26] he wrestled a man you know who the man
[1:17:28] was is him
[1:17:30] that was the real man that needed to be
[1:17:31] defeated amen
[1:17:34] jacob was wrestling with himself
[1:17:37] it came to a place in his own life and
[1:17:41] it was a place where he
[1:17:42] reflected when he looked down inwardly
[1:17:45] and the bible says he was left alone
[1:17:50] who's going to die here jacob's going to
[1:17:52] die here
[1:17:53] it's a place where he could have death
[1:17:55] to jacob or it wasn't going to be
[1:17:57] jacob and god it was going to be a
[1:17:59] prince israel
[1:18:01] a prince that has prevailed with god
[1:18:05] he's going to come to the end of himself
[1:18:08] he's going to die as brother adam said
[1:18:10] he's going to
[1:18:12] lay aside his own nature lay aside
[1:18:16] his own character lay aside his own ways
[1:18:19] of thinking you know even as a believer
[1:18:22] even as a holy ghost field filled with
[1:18:25] the spirit
[1:18:26] christian you can get to the place to
[1:18:28] where you can
[1:18:29] almost in your own self excuse yourself
[1:18:32] for how you are
[1:18:33] i'm a believer i know i love the lord
[1:18:35] i've been filled with the spirit of god
[1:18:39] but yet you still want to carry some of
[1:18:41] your own ways and some of your own
[1:18:43] thinking and some of your own attitudes
[1:18:47] my i just i studied this today looking
[1:18:49] at the life of jacob
[1:18:51] and i just kept hearing the words of
[1:18:53] brother branham
[1:18:54] when he would when he was talking about
[1:18:57] god
[1:18:58] molding him and and there he is
[1:19:01] losing his his daughter and his and his
[1:19:04] wife
[1:19:05] and brother adams just says there was
[1:19:06] just too much
[1:19:08] of of william branham still alive yeah
[1:19:12] and god had to crush it out and crush it
[1:19:15] out and what is
[1:19:16] what does it mean to get the real
[1:19:17] character of the uh of the character of
[1:19:20] christ
[1:19:20] it's when god can say i'm not just here
[1:19:23] to reform you
[1:19:24] i'm not just here to reform and take all
[1:19:26] of the ways that you think and all of
[1:19:28] the ways that you were formed and i'm
[1:19:29] going to
[1:19:30] transform it and reform it god says no
[1:19:33] i want to completely remove you and i
[1:19:36] want to place
[1:19:37] me i don't just want to change and give
[1:19:41] you a new spirit
[1:19:42] and but keep the old you i want to
[1:19:45] completely
[1:19:46] annihilate all of you and crush
[1:19:49] all of you so that i can come through
[1:19:52] you i
[1:19:52] can be reflected so that the word can
[1:19:55] reflect itself through you
[1:19:57] amen it's got to be a complete sense
[1:19:59] surrender
[1:20:01] a complete dine out to yourself
[1:20:05] we read this many times i think i've
[1:20:07] read it here one one of the time before
[1:20:08] brother brad if you can put that
[1:20:09] powerpoint
[1:20:10] up on the screen i wasn't debated within
[1:20:13] myself to read this but i'm just going
[1:20:14] to read it go through it very quickly
[1:20:17] because i want you to see what real
[1:20:18] character forming
[1:20:20] molding looks like listen to what
[1:20:22] brother branham says here and standing
[1:20:24] in the gap
[1:20:25] he says one night the lord woke him up
[1:20:26] now this is speaking of about uh
[1:20:29] uh you'll understand some of this you go
[1:20:31] to the next slide
[1:20:32] uh brother baby he says one night the
[1:20:35] lord woke him
[1:20:36] up one morning we were sitting i looked
[1:20:38] in jerusalem lord's communion table i
[1:20:39] was talking he couldn't understand it
[1:20:40] brother roy
[1:20:41] setting present looking at me right now
[1:20:43] i saw and he called me
[1:20:44] up in houston out or out in arizona sent
[1:20:46] me a letter and i called him back
[1:20:48] he said you were sitting there brother
[1:20:49] branham and i saw that big pillar of
[1:20:51] light
[1:20:51] come in and get you and take you away
[1:20:53] from the lord's table and you went
[1:20:55] westward
[1:20:56] because he was sitting on the east side
[1:20:57] watching me go west and this light come
[1:20:59] in
[1:21:00] and taken me out said it was one morning
[1:21:03] like it was a vision got up in the bed
[1:21:05] about three or four o'clock in the
[1:21:07] morning something like that and saw this
[1:21:08] happen
[1:21:09] and he said he screamed looked like for
[1:21:11] days brother bill come back
[1:21:13] and roy and i have been real brothers we
[1:21:14] live together hunt together we're just
[1:21:16] brothers
[1:21:17] he screamed for me till he was hoarse in
[1:21:19] his throat come back
[1:21:20] bring him back bring him back crying he
[1:21:22] said here come that pillar of fire
[1:21:24] coming back or a cloud come back
[1:21:26] and he set me at the head of the table
[1:21:28] and notice what brother madam says and i
[1:21:30] had been
[1:21:31] changed it was a mystery to brother roy
[1:21:34] me being changed to look different
[1:21:37] i lay this up here for something i want
[1:21:40] to remember brother branham
[1:21:41] lays this up here as a note a little
[1:21:44] sticky note
[1:21:45] and and what's written on it being
[1:21:47] changed
[1:21:48] wow now it's very something you may not
[1:21:51] think when you read this
[1:21:53] you think of some supernatural sphere
[1:21:54] that brother adam's talking about
[1:21:56] like a transfiguration it's not at all
[1:21:58] what he's what he's going to refer to
[1:22:00] but he says you look different me being
[1:22:02] changed to look different i'll leave
[1:22:03] this up here for something i
[1:22:04] remember being changed when i give him
[1:22:07] the interpretation of it now
[1:22:09] brother branham is going to give him the
[1:22:11] interpretation of an
[1:22:12] oh oh how it means something so
[1:22:15] different
[1:22:16] than what brother roy probably even
[1:22:18] thought now i'm preaching this to myself
[1:22:21] could we stand notice now i'm preaching
[1:22:23] this to myself
[1:22:24] in this could we stand and see a human
[1:22:28] being
[1:22:28] that's blind physically blind and know
[1:22:31] that he's walking over a cliff
[1:22:33] could we in our stall
[1:22:37] stay stale is what brother and i'm
[1:22:39] saying there's stall state of mind
[1:22:41] that we're in this morning can we stand
[1:22:44] and see a blind man walk over a cliff
[1:22:48] blind and not try to warn him
[1:22:53] it would be there would be so cruel we
[1:22:56] would be
[1:22:57] so indifferent in our heart
[1:23:00] could you imagine a person getting so
[1:23:03] indifferent
[1:23:04] that he could almost laugh and see a
[1:23:06] blind man that couldn't see
[1:23:08] can't see can't help himself
[1:23:10] deliberately walk
[1:23:11] over a cliff it would be a bad thing to
[1:23:14] do nothing but now everybody look this
[1:23:16] way
[1:23:17] look this way mute that for me brother
[1:23:19] brad just press b it'll blank it

[1:23:24] you press b the key on the keyboard
[1:23:26] you got to press start slideshow though
[1:23:28] again now listen to what brother branham
[1:23:30] says
[1:23:31] could you imagine seeing a man blind
[1:23:34] walking over a cliff and not
[1:23:37] say anything about it he says how
[1:23:40] indifferent
[1:23:41] of a person you'd have to be what a bad
[1:23:44] thing well now listen to what he says
[1:23:46] here
[1:23:46] put it back up if you could brother brad
[1:23:48] well

[1:24:10] says what to my brother look here at the
[1:24:12] bottom
[1:24:12] world over i just want to make this
[1:24:15] confession
[1:24:16] humbly say it that that that just about
[1:24:19] what i was
[1:24:20] doing or fixing to do
[1:24:24] as this is honest it's transparent here
[1:24:27] brother branham
[1:24:27] uses an example of letting them blind
[1:24:29] men walk over clifford and other men
[1:24:31] says that's
[1:24:31] that's all i had gotten to such a place
[1:24:34] that's just what i was about to do
[1:24:36] i had been preaching for years notice
[1:24:39] i had been preaching for years and i
[1:24:41] become an
[1:24:42] old man an old veteran preacher
[1:24:45] and had a lot of hard battles and maybe
[1:24:48] i'm
[1:24:49] scarred all cut up on the inside from
[1:24:52] fights
[1:24:53] because my lot that the lord gave me was
[1:24:55] not back to kiss the babies and to marry
[1:24:57] the young and bury the old
[1:24:59] but it was to hold a two-handed sword at
[1:25:02] the battlefront
[1:25:03] against the wiles of paganism and
[1:25:05] demonology and
[1:25:07] the powers of darkness and fight it with
[1:25:09] the word of god
[1:25:10] till i seen the enemy defeated i been
[1:25:14] cut deep he's confessing of his own self
[1:25:18] this is this is this is his own
[1:25:20] character
[1:25:21] he says because of all the battles that
[1:25:23] i had went through
[1:25:24] he says i was so indifferent in my heart
[1:25:26] i could watch a blind man
[1:25:28] almost a deaf man not even know the
[1:25:30] danger was coming he said and not even
[1:25:32] say anything to him i
[1:25:33] became so indifferent in my own heart
[1:25:36] and he says i'd been preaching became a
[1:25:37] he says it wasn't for me to kiss the
[1:25:39] babies and bury the dead but i had to
[1:25:41] wield a two-edged sword
[1:25:43] and he says i had been cut deep many
[1:25:45] times now
[1:25:46] i met a man listen to this i met a man
[1:25:49] was a christian and he's got a great
[1:25:51] country right under alaska
[1:25:53] and i had made up my mind that being
[1:25:55] that i had left here and gone west that
[1:25:57] i would take my wife and
[1:25:58] kind of trap her into something i'd get
[1:26:01] her up there and i'd become a guide and
[1:26:02] then if the lord wanted me to do
[1:26:04] something i'd let my hair grow out
[1:26:06] i'd have my whiskers and i'd go back in
[1:26:09] there and be a guide
[1:26:10] there's only about two or three indians
[1:26:12] live back in the country there
[1:26:14] i'd just be a guide i'd help bud and if
[1:26:17] the lord wanted me to do anything i'd
[1:26:19] say all right lord it give me a vision
[1:26:22] i would slip on out and he says then i'm
[1:26:26] being a nervous i say this
[1:26:28] kind of quietly maybe a neurotically
[1:26:31] type of person that i
[1:26:32] am knowing that i was insufficient at
[1:26:34] the beginning for the
[1:26:36] job ever felt that way
[1:26:41] you ever felt that way you'd be real
[1:26:44] transparent tell me what this is the
[1:26:45] prophet of god being
[1:26:47] laying a book wide open nothing to hide
[1:26:50] and he says you know from the beginning
[1:26:53] and he says i just knowing that i was
[1:26:54] insufficient at the beginning for the
[1:26:56] job as many as complained
[1:26:58] i had to do it it was hard but i thought
[1:27:01] god why didn't you call somebody that
[1:27:03] could have done it
[1:27:05] and i'm sorry but i failed
[1:27:10] the people just won't listen to me
[1:27:14] and i failed to do what i should have
[1:27:16] done
[1:27:17] somewhere because they won't listen
[1:27:21] my mother that's just passed on into
[1:27:22] glory about a little over a year ago my
[1:27:24] mother her father was a hunter
[1:27:26] i think i got all that come out from him
[1:27:28] in that stand because i love the woods
[1:27:30] i thought if this people that call
[1:27:32] themselves christians
[1:27:34] if they don't want to listen to the
[1:27:35] message that i'm preaching then let them
[1:27:37] alone
[1:27:38] i'll just stop it all together and i'll
[1:27:41] go up into the mountain
[1:27:43] and i know a friend to wear you know
[1:27:45] what he was doing his reasoning within
[1:27:47] his own self
[1:27:48] justifying his own complex
[1:27:53] and he says if they're not going to
[1:27:54] listen i'll just just just you know
[1:27:56] lord i was never even called to i was
[1:27:58] never going gonna be sufficient anyway
[1:28:00] you should have chosen somebody else
[1:28:02] lord i don't even know why you called me
[1:28:04] i can't even finish the job i've just
[1:28:06] i'm just gonna say i failed
[1:28:09] and he says i'll just stop it all
[1:28:11] together i'll go up into the mountain i
[1:28:12] know a friend
[1:28:14] and brother branham says before leaving
[1:28:16] here i might drop this in
[1:28:18] and well hurry i dreamed a funny dream
[1:28:20] an odd dream
[1:28:22] and i hope when my brother-in-law gets a
[1:28:23] hold of this
[1:28:25] it doesn't hurt his feelings and i hope
[1:28:27] i don't hurt my wife who is setting
[1:28:29] present now but she knows it
[1:28:31] about many months ago right on well it
[1:28:33] was around about october november
[1:28:36] i dreamed that i was roaming out in the
[1:28:38] dark
[1:28:40] and well i i had no place to go nobody
[1:28:43] cared for me
[1:28:44] and i had become a bum just
[1:28:47] a bum and i was cold and i looked in the
[1:28:51] distance and saw a fire and when i got
[1:28:52] over there it was a city dump
[1:28:55] and they had ditches and the fire was in
[1:28:56] these ditches and between the ditches
[1:28:58] was slick where bums
[1:29:00] he says where bums would sleep there to
[1:29:02] keep warm keep from freezing
[1:29:04] between these fires on a cold winter
[1:29:06] night and i was cold
[1:29:07] and i walked up to this fire to get warm
[1:29:10] and it was laying full of bums
[1:29:12] and they were i didn't see any of them
[1:29:14] but they all like had stalls or
[1:29:16] places where their sleeping place was
[1:29:19] and i
[1:29:19] saw my brother-in-law fletcher broy
[1:29:23] and when i woke up before i woke up
[1:29:25] fletch said to me
[1:29:26] he said in the dream he said billy i'll
[1:29:29] hunt you a place
[1:29:30] brother bill you fed my children when
[1:29:32] they were hungry
[1:29:33] you was a daddy to them now i'll find
[1:29:35] you a place here to keep warm
[1:29:37] and we went walking by the bums places
[1:29:40] and finally come to a place
[1:29:42] he said i'll sit down here and i said
[1:29:46] i'll walk up here and see if i could
[1:29:48] find a place
[1:29:50] and i walked up and looked out in the
[1:29:52] dark cold night
[1:29:53] and i thought think of it one time
[1:29:57] god almighty let me lead his church
[1:30:00] one time he let me preach his gospel
[1:30:04] and see souls saved men and women come
[1:30:07] from around the world to speak with me
[1:30:09] for a few minutes
[1:30:11] and here i am now a bum
[1:30:14] and nobody wants me and i'm cold
[1:30:18] what must i do then i woke up
[1:30:22] now brother branham inserts this this
[1:30:24] this vision this dream
[1:30:25] that he has and he and listen just
[1:30:28] listen to what he says here
[1:30:30] next next slide there he says i told my
[1:30:31] wife i said maybe it means that fletch
[1:30:34] is in need
[1:30:35] so we hurried up to see if he says
[1:30:39] what must i do then i woke up let me
[1:30:40] okay i got it here maybe fletch is in
[1:30:42] need so we hurried up to see if we could
[1:30:43] find him and his
[1:30:44] his brother found him so i come back
[1:30:46] down from canada with fred and them
[1:30:48] the other day in my mind i had it made
[1:30:51] up
[1:30:51] if these people didn't want to hear my
[1:30:53] message all right
[1:30:55] they didn't have to i had preached now
[1:30:57] for about 35
[1:30:58] years and the last 15 to 18 years
[1:31:02] i've done nothing but just to the lord
[1:31:05] i've tried to live so close to him and
[1:31:08] not say a word
[1:31:09] till he told me first everything then i
[1:31:12] come down from canada and fred
[1:31:14] or brother roy told me his dream he and
[1:31:16] i brother banks rode along together just
[1:31:18] before we separated
[1:31:20] i say the people i never regarded myself
[1:31:23] anybody knowing this but people have
[1:31:24] said brother brandon the lord called you
[1:31:26] to be his prophet
[1:31:27] well i've never regarded myself as that
[1:31:29] but i begin
[1:31:30] i begin to get to the time that i was
[1:31:32] about ready to do it to think well
[1:31:34] maybe i am if i am i'll live back in the
[1:31:37] wilderness and if i'm
[1:31:38] live back in the wilderness then i'll be
[1:31:40] his prophet see and then if he wants to
[1:31:42] send me somewhere
[1:31:43] while he's not using me then i'll i'll
[1:31:45] sure catch some fine fish
[1:31:49] and do some things of course that was
[1:31:52] kind of a selfish attitude see because
[1:31:55] i wanted to do that amen
[1:32:00] you know how quickly the devil will get
[1:32:01] you to justify
[1:32:03] now listen this isn't sin he's not
[1:32:05] saying
[1:32:07] he's not saying uh uh lord i just give
[1:32:09] up and you know
[1:32:10] these are you know these people won't
[1:32:11] listen to me i gave it my best for
[1:32:14] uh 15 18 years now lord i just been
[1:32:16] doing everything i've been giving it my
[1:32:18] all lord
[1:32:18] but you know what it just didn't work no
[1:32:20] one's listening uh
[1:32:22] that no one's changing and so you know
[1:32:24] what
[1:32:25] he doesn't say i'm just going to go i'm
[1:32:26] just going to turn my back i'm going to
[1:32:28] go back to the you know to the world i'm
[1:32:29] going to go to the bars no he's
[1:32:31] he's coming up with a nice little plan a
[1:32:34] little plan b
[1:32:35] amen amen sort of like david and zick
[1:32:38] like remember when he goes to zick
[1:32:39] lagoon
[1:32:40] he just checks out of the pressure from
[1:32:42] saul and he teams up with the philistine
[1:32:47] and then loses almost loses his wife and
[1:32:49] all of his kids and all of his men's
[1:32:51] kids
[1:32:51] what a mess because it was a plan b
[1:32:55] there's a plan b he just sort of figures
[1:32:58] it out as he goes
[1:32:59] lord i'm just gonna go here i'll just
[1:33:01] you know i'll just catch many fine fish
[1:33:03] and you know when you have a message if
[1:33:05] i'm a prophet
[1:33:06] you know i'll just come out storm out of
[1:33:08] the wilderness and get my message and
[1:33:09] then go back into the woods
[1:33:11] he says kind of selfish and he says
[1:33:14] because that's
[1:33:15] i wanted to do that now it isn't just
[1:33:18] exactly the thing that's to do
[1:33:20] and now i had that made up in my mind
[1:33:23] to do that i got up at about four
[1:33:26] o'clock
[1:33:27] got started driving billy was sleeping
[1:33:30] we went into a place and i was thinking
[1:33:32] on my mind you know what one of these
[1:33:34] days as soon as i can get the wife up
[1:33:35] there
[1:33:36] i won't tell her what i'm going to do i
[1:33:38] just get up there and then i'm going to
[1:33:39] tell her
[1:33:40] i love this place so well no need of us
[1:33:42] going anywhere else
[1:33:44] let's just stay here and that's that's
[1:33:46] back from civilization 1100 miles from
[1:33:49] anywhere
[1:33:50] way on the wilderness i thought won't
[1:33:52] that be fine
[1:33:53] i won't have to get a haircut
[1:33:56] i won't have to dress up
[1:34:00] i'll just be a regular mountaineer what
[1:34:03] i always
[1:34:04] wanted to do
[1:34:08] now do you know why he got to this place
[1:34:12] because he couldn't get people
[1:34:15] to listen imagine amen
[1:34:19] imagine because he couldn't get people
[1:34:22] to conform to change to listen
[1:34:26] he's just ready to give up he says i
[1:34:29] won't even have to dress i won't have to
[1:34:30] comb my hair i want to do nothing i'll
[1:34:32] just
[1:34:32] have a message and i'll preach it to the
[1:34:34] people and i'll go back
[1:34:36] and he says he says won't that be fine a
[1:34:40] regular mountaineer would always want to
[1:34:41] be i said i got some guns some people
[1:34:43] give me i'll be a guy like you never
[1:34:44] heard of i'll just love it then if the
[1:34:47] lord tells me to go down and tell
[1:34:48] somebody something i'll run out and tell
[1:34:49] them come back again and i'll help bud
[1:34:52] and
[1:34:52] we'll have a real place here
[1:34:55] i love how he says i was thinking on
[1:34:58] that
[1:35:00] like brother i'm saying oh man i was
[1:35:02] just wow what what what it could be
[1:35:04] yeah amen what it could be i was just
[1:35:08] thinking on that
[1:35:10] it said listen to what the holy spirit
[1:35:12] says
[1:35:13] next slide it said carry out your plans
[1:35:18] and you'll be like that i said lord
[1:35:22] i don't want to be like that it said
[1:35:25] your wife will go too
[1:35:27] she won't live up there in them hills
[1:35:29] like that and you'll become a bum
[1:35:33] just as the dream showed you you would
[1:35:36] i said i don't i don't want to be but i
[1:35:39] i don't want to have to live like that
[1:35:40] i want to do something different but i
[1:35:42] was told that you had called me to be a
[1:35:44] prophet
[1:35:45] and i want to live in the wilderness
[1:35:47] like the prophet but i was using my
[1:35:49] own excuse so i could hunt
[1:35:52] my own good you know what you know what
[1:35:55] you're seeing
[1:35:56] you're not seeing the character of
[1:35:57] christ reflected you're seeing the
[1:35:59] character of william branham
[1:36:02] it's good character wasn't sinful wasn't
[1:36:04] a bad idea
[1:36:05] wasn't to go back to the world it but it
[1:36:08] was the human this is what i'm talking
[1:36:10] about
[1:36:10] this is what jabek took out of jacob it
[1:36:13] took jacob out of jacob
[1:36:15] amen it wasn't that brother branham was
[1:36:18] evil it wasn't that he had evil thoughts
[1:36:20] but there was still too much of william
[1:36:22] branham in william branham's thinking
[1:36:25] brother brandon says i was using my own
[1:36:27] excuse
[1:36:28] i was using my own excuse so i can hunt
[1:36:31] he says
[1:36:32] now listen to what he says i let the
[1:36:34] sick lay i want the lord to tell me
[1:36:37] where to go
[1:36:38] and not to that's wrong i had built
[1:36:41] myself a complex because the people
[1:36:44] didn't hear my message and you god
[1:36:46] forbid that i'll try to compare the life
[1:36:47] of now like moses
[1:36:49] but it's exactly what moses did that
[1:36:51] people wouldn't listen to him when he
[1:36:52] come to deliver them so he just left him
[1:36:54] alone
[1:36:54] went into the wilderness but god turned
[1:36:56] him around and he had long
[1:36:58] forgot the suffering people and these
[1:37:01] rickeys
[1:37:03] and raketas that have so sassed the word
[1:37:07] i've called them ricky and raketa god
[1:37:09] give me to understand
[1:37:11] i shouldn't do that because that's many
[1:37:14] of them are still
[1:37:16] his children they can't help
[1:37:20] listen to what he says he says i'm a
[1:37:22] they can't help because they act so much
[1:37:24] different
[1:37:24] some of these old cold formal churches
[1:37:26] has got them
[1:37:27] that spirit upon them they're in as much
[1:37:30] in prison as
[1:37:31] israel was in prison just as much as
[1:37:34] moses went down to deliver them from
[1:37:36] slavery
[1:37:37] human beings that loved jesus christ
[1:37:39] would
[1:37:40] serve him if they only know what to
[1:37:43] serve him by
[1:37:44] and they're in bondage under
[1:37:46] denominationalism that tells
[1:37:48] them don't you do this and don't you do
[1:37:50] that but the call of god must come
[1:37:52] whoever wants to march towards the
[1:37:54] promised land let him march
[1:37:55] or own our road to the promised land
[1:37:58] amen let them come march
[1:38:00] we're on our road to meet christ at the
[1:38:02] end time
[1:38:03] and i wanted to bring this to you why
[1:38:06] have i been transparent
[1:38:08] why have i played it all out there
[1:38:10] brother adam says i wanted to bring this
[1:38:11] to you
[1:38:12] so that you would see and show you the
[1:38:14] mistake
[1:38:15] that a man can make yet being sincere
[1:38:21] moses lost the feeling of his people
[1:38:23] because they wouldn't listen to him and
[1:38:25] brother roy
[1:38:26] now here's that dream and brother roy
[1:38:28] you see your dream
[1:38:31] and now i can't cannot go with a
[1:38:33] ministry like that
[1:38:35] until i feel different in my heart about
[1:38:38] it
[1:38:39] no matter if god did tell me but that
[1:38:42] is that change that brother roy
[1:38:45] seen coming transfigured body change
[1:38:49] no all it was was the character of a man
[1:38:53] dying and the character of christ coming
[1:38:56] forth
[1:38:58] amen that was the character that's what
[1:39:00] brother roy seen in his dream brother
[1:39:01] and sitting at the head of the table he
[1:39:02] says you were different you were
[1:39:04] different brother branham
[1:39:05] brother branham says something's got to
[1:39:07] change
[1:39:09] me because i in my own heart if i go out
[1:39:11] there feeling the way i do now i still
[1:39:13] feel that
[1:39:13] they ought to have heard that message
[1:39:15] they ought to have done it and i don't
[1:39:16] have the feeling for the people that i
[1:39:18] should have
[1:39:19] until i can get that feeling there's no
[1:39:21] need of me going because i'd be a
[1:39:22] hypocrite
[1:39:23] all these years i've tried to serve him
[1:39:25] with a true heart and i won't go out
[1:39:26] there being a hypocrite
[1:39:28] i've got to feel that that it isn't
[1:39:30] ricky's and raketa
[1:39:32] it isn't this bunch it's god's children
[1:39:34] that's in bondage
[1:39:35] and i must go into them until i can feel
[1:39:39] that way
[1:39:40] i'll just have to loaf around preach
[1:39:42] some conventions and things
[1:39:44] but wait god bless you
[1:39:49] each one listen to the next slide we
[1:39:52] hope to see you again real soon till
[1:39:54] then will you do me this one favor both
[1:39:56] here and on tape brethren
[1:39:58] pray that god will place into my heart
[1:40:00] that's something that i
[1:40:01] lost out there in that complex
[1:40:04] so easy to build a complex i took the
[1:40:08] time to read that
[1:40:10] because you can see the character wasn't
[1:40:13] sin
[1:40:13] something sinful jordan takes care of
[1:40:16] that you die to yourself
[1:40:18] but you've got it empty to have
[1:40:20] character of jesus
[1:40:22] i have the character of messiah what
[1:40:24] you've got to do you've got to come to
[1:40:25] jabek
[1:40:26] just like jacob and wrestle with
[1:40:29] yourself
[1:40:30] and die to yourself what was jacob what
[1:40:32] was it going to represent
[1:40:34] a complete death to jacob to where he
[1:40:37] wouldn't be called jacob anymore
[1:40:39] he'd be called israel and the bible says
[1:40:42] that he limped
[1:40:44] notice this here as we close we're at 8
[1:40:46] 40. just give me
[1:40:48] give me just a few minutes i won't take
[1:40:51] 20.
[1:40:52] okay give me about five
[1:40:56] it's wednesday i can't i can't take 20.
[1:40:59] so jacob comes now listen he had
[1:41:03] many ways look at uh pull up genesis 32
[1:41:06] if you could verse 10.
[1:41:07] we read it you okay is everybody all
[1:41:09] right can we go just a few more minutes
[1:41:14] he says oh god i am this is genesis 32
[1:41:18] verse 10.
[1:41:18] he says i'm not worthy of the least of
[1:41:21] all thy mercies and of all thy truth
[1:41:23] which thou has shown unto thy servant
[1:41:25] so notice this isn't a sinful man
[1:41:29] this man had had an experience even
[1:41:32] even at bethel you remember the dream
[1:41:35] that he has
[1:41:36] the dream where he sees the latter and
[1:41:38] angels of sinning and descending
[1:41:40] it's a man who's had experiences he's
[1:41:43] had an experience with god
[1:41:45] already i hope you catch this everybody
[1:41:48] young and old alike this wasn't a sinner
[1:41:51] coming to
[1:41:52] coming to repentance jacob turned into
[1:41:55] israel as not a sinner coming to
[1:41:56] repentance
[1:41:58] it's a man who's already came to god in
[1:42:01] an ex by an experience a religious
[1:42:03] experience
[1:42:04] but now god is going to take him from a
[1:42:06] religious
[1:42:07] experience he's going to take him from a
[1:42:10] gift
[1:42:11] and he's going to introduce him to the
[1:42:13] giver of that gift
[1:42:15] and he's going to meet not just the get
[1:42:18] not just the get
[1:42:18] not just the gift he's going to meet the
[1:42:20] giver
[1:42:22] and he's going to be changed permanently
[1:42:26] not a temporary change not a one-time
[1:42:29] experience
[1:42:31] that one time experience jacob goes from
[1:42:34] bethel
[1:42:34] from that one time experience and then
[1:42:37] and then dwells in shechem and
[1:42:39] and all we've preached on that before
[1:42:41] and all of the this
[1:42:43] sin that comes into jacob's life and the
[1:42:45] consequences of bad decisions
[1:42:47] wasn't was wha what happened brother
[1:42:49] matt
[1:42:50] what happened was is that you can have a
[1:42:52] good religious experience
[1:42:54] you could have a good experience in god
[1:42:56] but it can only be a skin-deep
[1:42:58] experience
[1:43:01] maybe it's just an emotional experience
[1:43:03] and you've experienced god in some kind
[1:43:05] of way but let me just ask you
[1:43:07] have you been changed from you from the
[1:43:10] creature that you once were
[1:43:12] have you died out to yourself do you see
[1:43:14] the character
[1:43:16] of the messiah reflecting in your life
[1:43:18] when you look at the mirror of god's
[1:43:20] word
[1:43:22] or do you still see too much of
[1:43:25] jacob he has an experience
[1:43:29] in bethel but this was going to be
[1:43:32] different
[1:43:33] this was going to be different this is
[1:43:36] where god was going to deal with
[1:43:38] sin god was going to deal with pride
[1:43:41] god was going to deal with his his his
[1:43:44] his
[1:43:44] sinful self he was going to give a death
[1:43:47] blow
[1:43:48] a final blow to jacob
[1:43:51] being jacob the bible says
[1:43:54] he says i am not worthy of the least of
[1:43:56] these listen to this obedient prayer
[1:43:58] and he says having shown that i serve
[1:44:01] for with my staff i passed over this
[1:44:02] jordan and now
[1:44:03] i am become two bands i'm gonna have to
[1:44:06] hurry and to skip through some of this
[1:44:08] here he comes to this place
[1:44:12] of complete surrender
[1:44:15] he comes to a crisis you know sometimes
[1:44:19] god has to get you to a crisis
[1:44:22] in your own life to where there's no
[1:44:25] there's no going back there's no going
[1:44:28] forward
[1:44:28] there's no way to to check out with
[1:44:31] distractions
[1:44:32] but you've got to face it you've got to
[1:44:35] face yourself
[1:44:37] and jacob had to face himself he was
[1:44:40] forced
[1:44:41] to completely be exposed no more hiding
[1:44:45] no more running no more excuses
[1:44:49] the bible says be sure your sins will
[1:44:52] find you out
[1:44:56] and jacob it came to a conflict a
[1:44:58] confrontation
[1:45:00] he wasn't going to get out of he wasn't
[1:45:03] going to get out of this one
[1:45:04] he wasn't going to buy his way out it
[1:45:07] wasn't going to trick his way out
[1:45:09] he wasn't going to sell her he wasn't
[1:45:11] going to scheme
[1:45:12] like he had been doing but now jacob
[1:45:15] comes
[1:45:16] face to face face to face
[1:45:20] genesis chapter 32 look there as we
[1:45:23] just read this together in genesis 32
[1:45:28] verse 26 let's go to genesis 32
[1:45:32] make sure i have that right
[1:45:35] verse 24 and jacob was left alone
[1:45:39] i think that's symbolic of something
[1:45:42] there's nobody there
[1:45:44] just you in the lord amen you and all of
[1:45:47] you
[1:45:47] 100 of you all of your faults
[1:45:51] all of your good all of your bad there's
[1:45:54] nothing
[1:45:55] hidden it's all exposed before the lord
[1:45:58] and jacob was left alone and there
[1:46:00] wrestled a man with him until the
[1:46:02] breaking
[1:46:03] of the day he was forced to expose
[1:46:07] himself to see
[1:46:08] himself for what he was
[1:46:11] for all that he was god didn't need to
[1:46:14] know but jacob needed to see
[1:46:16] jacob for who he really was that's why
[1:46:18] he asks him what his name was god knew
[1:46:20] exactly who his name was
[1:46:22] but god's trying to get jacob to realize
[1:46:24] something jacob
[1:46:26] look at who you are see yourself for who
[1:46:28] you really are
[1:46:31] see yourself for who you really are
[1:46:37] and he said unto him what is thy name
[1:46:39] verse 27
[1:46:41] and he said jacob scheister
[1:46:46] schemer suplanter a cheater
[1:46:51] because that's what he was but this is
[1:46:54] this is god
[1:46:55] saying i want you to i want you to
[1:46:58] don't think of anybody else don't think
[1:47:00] of your don't think of
[1:47:02] your past don't think of your family
[1:47:04] don't don't think of what happened to
[1:47:06] you when you're a child
[1:47:07] don't think of what happened to you that
[1:47:09] was out of your control
[1:47:11] don't think of the bad the incidents
[1:47:13] don't think of all your mistakes
[1:47:15] just look at you jacob think of you
[1:47:18] for one moment let go of everything else
[1:47:21] let go of everything else in your life
[1:47:23] jacob
[1:47:25] let go of everything what is your name
[1:47:29] and he said jacob look at yourself jacob
[1:47:33] expose yourself to you make sure you
[1:47:36] understand who you are
[1:47:38] you know sometimes we need to do that
[1:47:39] friends to realize that there is none
[1:47:41] good
[1:47:42] but god there's nothing good in us
[1:47:44] there's nothing good in you
[1:47:45] there's nothing we can give to the lord
[1:47:49] nothing no human works that god wants no
[1:47:53] human ability that god wants he just
[1:47:55] wants it all
[1:47:56] all of you mind body soul
[1:48:00] spirit surrendered
[1:48:04] and then god can reflect his character
[1:48:07] through your life
[1:48:08] he can't reflect him as long as i'm in
[1:48:11] the way
[1:48:13] i say lord don't let me be in the way
[1:48:17] don't let me be a hindrance
[1:48:20] he says next next verse there verse 28
[1:48:24] and he said thy name shall be called no
[1:48:27] more jacob
[1:48:28] but israel for has a prefer as a prince
[1:48:32] thou has power with god and with men
[1:48:36] and has prevailed
[1:48:39] praise the lord and then god says in
[1:48:41] verse 29 notice this here
[1:48:43] and jacob asked him and said tell me i
[1:48:45] pray thee thy name and he said wherefore
[1:48:47] is it thou dost
[1:48:48] ask after my name and he blessed him
[1:48:51] right there
[1:48:52] something had happened he blessed him
[1:48:55] right there
[1:48:56] it wasn't it wasn't a blessing it wasn't
[1:48:59] a blessing
[1:49:02] it wasn't a materialistic blessing
[1:49:05] you could receive many materialistic
[1:49:07] blessings from god jacob had prayed this
[1:49:09] before
[1:49:10] even at bethel his prayer if you go and
[1:49:12] read his prayer
[1:49:13] it's all about god bless me so i can pay
[1:49:16] tithes
[1:49:19] that's literally go read his prayer to
[1:49:21] god that's what he says
[1:49:22] he says lord give me money so i can give
[1:49:24] some back to you
[1:49:27] you know many times we want the blessing
[1:49:28] from god god bless my business so that i
[1:49:30] can bless others well really is that
[1:49:32] really what you really want if you'd be
[1:49:34] real or is that pride in your own heart
[1:49:36] deceitfulness
[1:49:39] and god says jacob asked him and says
[1:49:41] tell me i pray thee that name wherefore
[1:49:42] as thou has asked for my name and he
[1:49:44] blessed him
[1:49:44] what does he do he touches notice verse
[1:49:47] 30 go to the next verse here
[1:49:49] and jacob called the name of the place
[1:49:50] pinaya for i have seen god
[1:49:52] face to face and my life
[1:49:56] is preserved and he passed and as he
[1:49:59] passed verse 31
[1:50:01] and as he passed over penile the sun
[1:50:03] rose upon him
[1:50:04] and he halted upon his thigh it's going
[1:50:08] to represent something it's going to
[1:50:10] represent
[1:50:11] i'm changed forever
[1:50:14] i'm changed in so much the bible says
[1:50:16] the children of israel
[1:50:17] ain't not of the sinew which shrank
[1:50:19] which is upon the hollow of the thigh to
[1:50:21] this day
[1:50:22] because he touched the hollow of jacob's
[1:50:24] thigh in the sinew
[1:50:26] that shrank he's so permanently
[1:50:30] changed that everyone
[1:50:33] around him could tell
[1:50:36] something is different
[1:50:40] when god changes you you don't have to
[1:50:43] broadcast it
[1:50:44] you don't have to announce it you don't
[1:50:46] have to you don't have to publish it
[1:50:49] when god really changes you everybody
[1:50:52] can tell
[1:50:54] your family can tell your husband can
[1:50:56] tell your wife can tell your parents can
[1:50:58] tell your church can tell
[1:51:01] when it's a real work an inward work of
[1:51:03] the holy spirit
[1:51:06] your character changes not just your
[1:51:08] actions
[1:51:09] not just about your actions that's about
[1:51:11] what you do or what you don't do but
[1:51:12] your
[1:51:13] character that part that needs to be
[1:51:15] molded that part that needs to reflect
[1:51:18] that part that that unless you give it
[1:51:20] unless you give of yourself
[1:51:22] and surrender yourself and say lord it's
[1:51:25] i i want to go past
[1:51:27] jordan i want to go i want to go past
[1:51:28] the red sea i want to cross
[1:51:30] alone over jabuk and i want you to
[1:51:33] change
[1:51:34] my character permanently lord
[1:51:38] how many could pray that prayer here
[1:51:39] today and say lord change me
[1:51:43] into your character could the musicians
[1:51:46] come
[1:51:47] where i can see the reflection where i
[1:51:50] can look into the mirror of god's word
[1:51:54] and i could see character coming back
[1:51:57] reflecting back
[1:51:59] but you've read this many times brother
[1:52:00] branham said this we've read it many
[1:52:02] times
[1:52:03] you could just play something for me
[1:52:04] character is a victory
[1:52:07] not a gift amen a man without character
[1:52:11] can't reign
[1:52:12] because power apart from character is
[1:52:14] satanic
[1:52:16] but power with character is fit to rule
[1:52:20] you have to suffer terrain the reason
[1:52:22] for this is that character
[1:52:23] simply is never made without
[1:52:27] suffering that's why the bible says
[1:52:30] think it not strange concerning fiery
[1:52:32] trials
[1:52:33] that are to try you brother branham says
[1:52:37] is it strange that god wants us to
[1:52:40] develop stand to your feet with me
[1:52:42] is it strange that god wants us to
[1:52:44] develop a christ-like
[1:52:45] character that comes through suffering
[1:52:49] he says no sir we all have trials how
[1:52:52] many could say
[1:52:53] i got trials how many has been chastened
[1:52:56] before by the lord
[1:52:59] he says the church that's not suffering
[1:53:02] that isn't being chastened that isn't
[1:53:04] being tried that isn't going through
[1:53:06] trials doesn't hasn't got it
[1:53:09] is it from god and he says but the goat
[1:53:12] of god
[1:53:13] is a christ-like character produced
[1:53:17] in the fiery furnace of affliction
[1:53:22] that's the right kind of gold
[1:53:25] that's the right kind of gold a
[1:53:28] christ-like character produced
[1:53:31] in the fiery furnace of affliction
[1:53:34] how many could say lord with your head
[1:53:37] bowed eyes closed could just raise the
[1:53:38] hand and say lord
[1:53:40] i want you to produce that kind of
[1:53:41] character in my life
[1:53:43] let me lay myself so all of me
[1:53:47] my thinking my complexes
[1:53:50] oh as brother adam says there's too much
[1:53:52] of me still living lord i want to
[1:53:54] confess that to you here tonight
[1:53:56] there's too much of me lord you've
[1:53:58] brought me a mighty long way
[1:53:59] you've changed me lord many many there's
[1:54:02] many things i can say i'm thankful lord
[1:54:05] things that you've just dropped out of
[1:54:06] my life of addiction and drugs and
[1:54:08] alcohol
[1:54:09] lord but i'm here with hands raised on a
[1:54:11] wednesday night to say
[1:54:13] but yet lord there's still too much of
[1:54:15] me left in me
[1:54:17] there's still too much of my own
[1:54:19] thinking too much of my own way so lord
[1:54:21] would you change me not nuts my behavior
[1:54:24] would you change my character
[1:54:26] let it reflect yours jesus i pray
[1:54:29] granted lord every hand that's up
[1:54:31] my hands up lord as a sign of surrender
[1:54:34] lord asking for that messiah
[1:54:36] character lord that not just lord not
[1:54:39] just to look at you
[1:54:40] and and and and father be thankful for
[1:54:43] the many victories lord but
[1:54:45] i want to be able to re to see myself
[1:54:47] identified with that sacrifice
[1:54:50] i want to see that character reflected
[1:54:52] in my family reflected in my church
[1:54:55] reflected in my conduct reflected in my
[1:54:57] reactions
[1:54:58] in what i do and how i live
[1:55:01] let it be christ light character that's
[1:55:05] molded
[1:55:05] you took men like abraham isaac and
[1:55:08] jacob
[1:55:09] identified yourself with men lord of
[1:55:12] fallen
[1:55:13] flesh of hang-ups and and all kinds of
[1:55:16] mistakes we just looked at the life of
[1:55:18] one
[1:55:19] but yet lord you identified yourself
[1:55:21] with this one man
[1:55:22] because you didn't look at a man who was
[1:55:24] good he looked at a man who believed
[1:55:27] a man who had faith lord and i don't
[1:55:30] look at myself as one who's who's
[1:55:32] good but i raise my hands and say lord
[1:55:34] but i believe your word with all of my
[1:55:36] heart
[1:55:37] i believe you lord and you said if i can
[1:55:40] just get you to believe
[1:55:41] lord so i raise my hands here tonight
[1:55:44] and i say i believe
[1:55:45] lord i believe your word i believe you
