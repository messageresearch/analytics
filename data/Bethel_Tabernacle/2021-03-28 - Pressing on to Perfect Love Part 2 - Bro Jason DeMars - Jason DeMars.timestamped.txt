[35:38] others as well
[35:40] we're gonna look in the scriptures
[35:41] continuing on part two
[35:43] pressing onto perfect love
[35:46] first corinthians 13 verse 4 will be our
[35:49] text
[35:51] we had a few prayer requests
[35:56] come in one we will
[35:59] pray for after the service for sister
[36:02] chastity
[36:03] writer to come up and pray for her also
[36:08] sister amariah some
[36:13] terrible pain and and went in for a uh
[36:17] attack on her appendix she's in the
[36:20] she's in the hospital now and they're
[36:22] just trying to determine whether they
[36:23] need to do
[36:24] surgery or not so i think the er
[36:28] thought that she was further along in
[36:30] appendicitis than
[36:32] than what she really is when they sent
[36:33] her up so we're just praying that she
[36:35] wouldn't have to have the surgery
[36:37] and that the lord would touch her and
[36:40] that nutrition and supplements could
[36:42] really take care of it
[36:44] rather than having to have the surgery
[36:45] at her age so
[36:47] amen want to pray for brother jason as
[36:49] well he's
[36:51] right now he's back is he back there
[36:53] he's not back there he's in the office
[36:55] still he's strong he's he's as far as
[36:58] the heart goes and all those issues
[37:00] blood pressure doing great
[37:02] but still with the dizziness this
[37:04] morning even feeling a little seasick so
[37:06] we want to pray for him as well
[37:08] so let's read our scripture by the way
[37:11] that tv back there is not
[37:12] on so i should say a monitor you can't
[37:15] say tv in a message church
[37:18] not allowed amen
[37:24] all right so first corinthians 13
[37:27] 4 through 7 and then verse 13.
[37:30] charity love suffereth long
[37:34] love is patient and is kind
[37:37] charity envies not charity
[37:40] vaunts not itself it doesn't boast is
[37:43] not
[37:43] puffed up it's not arrogant does not
[37:46] behave itself
[37:48] unseemly that means love is not rude
[37:51] seeks not her own in other words doesn't
[37:53] insist on her
[37:54] on its own way love is not easily
[37:57] provoked
[37:58] it's not irritable thinks no evil it's
[38:01] not resentful
[38:03] rejoice is not in iniquity but rejoices
[38:05] in the truth
[38:07] beareth all things believeth all things
[38:09] hopeth all things endureth
[38:11] all things and now abideth faith hope
[38:15] charity these three but the greatest of
[38:17] these is
[38:19] charity love amen heavenly father we
[38:22] just come to you lord and we're so
[38:23] thankful for your word
[38:25] we're so thankful lord for the
[38:27] revelation
[38:28] of that word that we're experiencing on
[38:31] a daily basis lord
[38:33] we just ask that you would come now by
[38:35] your by your spirit lord and work in
[38:37] every heart
[38:38] help me to just step out of the way that
[38:40] i would be a vessel that would speak
[38:43] that it would be you speaking directly
[38:45] to the hearts
[38:46] making that connection in your people
[38:48] lord
[38:49] we thank you for it lord we want to lift
[38:51] up brother jason
[38:53] our pastor even even now father would
[38:56] you just touch him lord take away that
[38:59] dizziness that he's experiencing lord we
[39:01] rebuke that in the name of jesus christ
[39:03] father
[39:04] we also want to pray for sister amariah
[39:06] lord and what she's going through lord
[39:08] would you just touch her
[39:10] lord would you just pull things back
[39:12] from there may she be completely healed
[39:14] she not need to have the surgery now
[39:16] lord may she
[39:18] walk out of that hospital feeling right
[39:20] and well
[39:21] without any problems father lord we ask
[39:24] that

[39:28] for everyone here lord if there's any
[39:30] with a need both
[39:32] spiritual healing or physical healing
[39:35] may they
[39:35] raise their hands to you lord and by
[39:38] an act of faith say healing is mine
[39:42] we thank you lord for that in jesus
[39:44] christ's name
[39:45] amen you can be seated
[39:49] i just want to go back and remind you
[39:52] kind of on the
[39:53] on the basis of what we're talking about
[39:55] pressing onto perfect love
[39:57] from the sermon adoption brother branham
[39:59] says thus saith the lord
[40:01] it'll take perfect love to put you in
[40:03] that place for that's all there was
[40:05] there no matter what money how much
[40:07] religious demonstrations
[40:09] how many good deeds you've done or
[40:10] whatever you've done that won't count
[40:12] nothing on that day it'll take perfect
[40:15] love
[40:16] so whatever you do you lay aside
[40:18] everything else into your
[40:19] just so filled with the love of god till
[40:22] you can love those who
[40:24] hate you amen may it be so in us
[40:28] and i also want to remind you when we
[40:30] have the holy goat when we receive the
[40:32] true
[40:33] genuine baptism of the holy ghost that
[40:36] makes us
[40:37] subject to having perfect
[40:40] love amen it's not something that we
[40:44] work ourselves into
[40:45] work ourselves up to but it's him
[40:48] thank you brother working within us
[40:52] by his spirit to achieve perfect love
[40:56] through a vessel again it's him doing it
[40:59] it's not you working into it in other
[41:02] words
[41:03] we're living in the hour that perfect
[41:06] love is to come
[41:07] amen amen every other age they had
[41:11] the first age when paul was on the scene
[41:13] they had the full word
[41:15] they fell away from that they had
[41:16] partial word so what did they have
[41:18] had then partial love so now we have the
[41:22] restoration of the full word
[41:25] so what are we subject to perfect love
[41:28] what did the restoration of the word
[41:30] come to do
[41:31] in make us really knowledgeable
[41:36] no to bring us to that hour of maturity
[41:41] maturity and what what is the greatest
[41:43] commandment love the lord your god with
[41:45] all your heart
[41:46] all your soul all your mind and all your
[41:47] strength and love your neighbor as
[41:50] yourself
[41:51] you say that's way too simple we got all
[41:52] these mysteries all those mysteries
[41:56] are given so that we would be able to
[41:59] grow
[42:00] into that loving our neighbor as
[42:03] ourself amen in a complete and mature
[42:07] way amen romans 12
[42:11] 9 and 10.
[42:18] let love be without dissimulation
[42:22] abhor that which is evil so that first
[42:24] love that's agape
[42:25] abhor that which is evil cleave to that
[42:28] which is good
[42:30] be kindly affection kindly affection
[42:33] that's the word philosophy remember from
[42:35] last time
[42:36] four different kinds of love filio which
[42:39] is friendship
[42:39] really uh storgos family
[42:43] passion between husband and wife and
[42:46] agape which is divine love
[42:50] unselfish love sacrificial love
[42:53] so be kindly affection means is
[42:55] combining
[42:57] friendship and family amen together so
[43:00] what are we we're a family the body of
[43:03] christ is a family
[43:05] it's a family of friends amen
[43:08] one to another with be kindly affection
[43:12] one one to another be filo store ghost
[43:14] one to another
[43:16] with philadelphia it's so interesting to
[43:20] to me when you think about that word
[43:21] philadelphia we have a city in our
[43:23] country called philadelphia
[43:25] and the very thing they're not known for
[43:28] is brotherly love
[43:31] isn't that astounding that's just the
[43:34] way the devil works
[43:35] he takes a place that's named after a
[43:37] christian virtue
[43:39] and turns it into a complete opposite
[43:41] perversion of that
[43:45] be philosophers one to another with
[43:47] philadelphia
[43:48] in honor preferring one another so
[43:51] really
[43:53] let love agape so we have all these
[43:56] things
[43:56] really are combined within us none of
[43:59] them are like well this is lower than
[44:01] this and
[44:01] we know divine love agape love is the
[44:04] highest
[44:05] but when we have agape love the other
[44:08] ones get covered too
[44:10] you can't just say i have agape love but
[44:12] not have filio love
[44:13] right right it's not going to work that
[44:16] way
[44:17] they're not separate different things
[44:20] one flows out of the other
[44:22] filial love should flow out of agape now
[44:25] you can have filial love
[44:27] without having agape you can have a
[44:29] friendship
[44:30] but the friendship is not based on
[44:34] self-sacrifice of divine love right
[44:37] the whole world is full of people that
[44:39] have friendship
[44:41] love the pharisees would felio one
[44:43] another
[44:44] you scratch my back all scratch yours
[44:47] that kind of friendship but agape is
[44:49] if you slap me in the face i'll scratch
[44:51] your back
[44:53] that's real friendship that's real filio
[44:56] love so again
[44:59] um we talked about before the different
[45:02] kinds of love
[45:04] let's get past that first thessalonians
[45:07] 4
[45:10] 9 and 10.
[45:13] so filio
[45:16] the literal meaning of that means to be
[45:18] a friend to
[45:21] filio comes from the word philos which
[45:23] means
[45:24] friend all right so philadelphia
[45:29] again that's the act of loving
[45:33] as a friend it's translated as brotherly
[45:36] love that's true but it's it's looking
[45:39] at the
[45:40] the looking at it in the sense of a
[45:42] friendship
[45:44] not in the sense of a blood family
[45:48] right and so i i i've said this before
[45:51] but i want you to understand
[45:52] filio is a lesser love than agape
[45:56] but we can't say well i want agape and
[45:58] just pass by filio
[46:00] we can't pass by friendship you say well
[46:03] i
[46:03] i love i love those people now there's
[46:05] an aspect where you can you're supposed
[46:07] to agape
[46:08] your enemy right that doesn't mean you
[46:11] have a friendship with them right it
[46:14] doesn't mean you have a friendship
[46:16] but you're too agape you're supposed to
[46:18] agape them regardless of relationship
[46:21] right but then there's that filial love
[46:25] which we are to have to one another as
[46:28] christians because why
[46:29] because the holy ghost teaches us to
[46:31] agape one another
[46:33] amen all right first thessalonians 4 9
[46:37] and 10 but as touching philadelphia
[46:40] brotherly love
[46:41] you need not that i write unto you for
[46:44] you yourselves are
[46:45] taught of god to agape
[46:48] one another amen he doesn't need to
[46:51] write them about philadelphia
[46:53] filial love because their the holy ghost
[46:55] is teaching
[46:56] them agape so that's why i'm saying
[46:59] when you have agape filio is going to be
[47:02] covered
[47:03] by that for one another friendship when
[47:05] you have agape love
[47:07] you're going to behave like a real
[47:10] scriptural friend to someone and indeed
[47:14] you do it toward all the brethren which
[47:15] are
[47:16] in all macedonia but we beseech you
[47:19] brethren
[47:20] that you increase more and more
[47:24] so we have the holy ghost we have love
[47:26] love within us but we have to grow
[47:29] more in agape love
[47:32] you have it god's teaching you yeah
[47:36] but you got to grow you gotta you gotta
[47:38] get more mature you gotta you've gotta
[47:40] increase
[47:41] in this love you can't just say well i
[47:43] got the holy ghost i don't need anything
[47:45] else
[47:46] no you have the holy ghost and it's time
[47:48] to grow
[47:50] it's time to increase in love
[47:57] it's easy to love when people
[48:02] are nice and agreeable to us
[48:06] and it's easy to talk about it when it's
[48:08] just
[48:09] this is our church these are people and
[48:11] everyone is at a distance from you
[48:14] but when you have fellowship with one
[48:16] another when you see
[48:17] really what people are like sometimes
[48:20] you struggle
[48:21] to love them why why
[48:25] why do we why do we struggle with that
[48:27] why why
[48:28] is it it's it's immaturity it's what it
[48:30] is
[48:31] and all of in me you know you might be
[48:33] mature in one area
[48:35] but immature in another area right
[48:37] that's com that's common for all of us
[48:40] my blind spot is not travis's blind spot
[48:43] they're different and so we need to
[48:46] in some areas some areas others need to
[48:49] increase
[48:50] other areas others need to increase but
[48:52] one area we all need to increase in
[48:54] is love i can promise that all areas i
[48:58] want to increase in all areas
[48:59] i never want to shut god off from
[49:01] working in my life
[49:02] because once we say well i've arrived
[49:05] we're saying we're putting up a big
[49:07] brick wall and saying god i don't need
[49:11] you
[49:12] that's not the right attitude saying i'm
[49:15] still here
[49:16] so that means that there's more for me
[49:18] to grow into
[49:20] that's exactly what brother branham
[49:21] taught us over and over and over and
[49:24] over again
[49:26] we need to increase more and more we
[49:28] need to have our hearts
[49:29] knit together in unity more and more
[49:32] colossians 2 1-2
[49:39] i just wanted to mention to everyone the
[49:43] i haven't been involved with the senior
[49:44] youth um brother matt is
[49:46] involved in other other the other
[49:48] brother matt is involved too and
[49:51] and different ones are reaching out pray
[49:54] for the senior youth
[49:55] there is a move of the holy spirit
[49:57] happening in the senior youth
[50:00] i'm really excited about it and just
[50:02] just
[50:03] i want everyone let's bond together
[50:06] and pray because there's a real it's
[50:08] going to start a lot of times
[50:09] revival it starts with young people and
[50:12] then it carries over to us so let it
[50:13] start in the young people and carry over
[50:15] to us old
[50:16] fogies amen
[50:19] colossians 2 1-2
[50:23] for i would that you knew what great
[50:24] conflict i have for you and for them at
[50:26] laodicea and as for many
[50:28] for as many as have not seen my face in
[50:31] the flesh
[50:32] that their hearts might be comforted
[50:34] look at this being knit
[50:36] together in love and unto all riches of
[50:40] the full assurance of understanding
[50:42] to the acknowledgement of the mystery of
[50:44] god and of the father and of
[50:45] christ i love that knit
[50:49] together in love
[50:52] knit together it speaks of how our
[50:54] bodies are joined together with joints
[50:57] and tendons and all of those things he's
[51:01] saying
[51:02] what's going to knit us together
[51:06] theology
[51:08] doctrine well we need those things we
[51:10] can't have spiritual health without good
[51:13] solid scriptural doctrine amen
[51:16] but what nits us together is
[51:19] agape love we want to be knit together
[51:23] with that love
[51:24] so that we can walk then in unity
[51:26] because part of what the
[51:27] body of christ is to experience in this
[51:30] day
[51:31] is the unity of the faith the unity of
[51:34] the revelation of the word
[51:36] right but it's it's it's beyond just
[51:38] having the same revelation
[51:39] it's having the same heart it's having
[51:42] being one mind of one accord that
[51:44] doesn't mean
[51:45] no mind that means one mind we have a
[51:48] unity
[51:48] in our heart and how are we going to get
[51:50] it by being knit together
[51:53] in perfect agape love
[51:58] all right so i want to take some time
[51:59] looking more at filio looking more at
[52:01] friendship
[52:03] again it's not a lower love it's not
[52:06] a weaker love it's not a a bad love
[52:09] it's just speaking about love in a
[52:12] different way
[52:13] the only way that this feeling
[52:15] friendship is completed
[52:17] isn't a christian that has the holy
[52:18] ghost
[52:21] and has agape love living in them
[52:23] because
[52:24] otherwise i'm just waiting to see uh did
[52:26] travis
[52:27] well he invited me over by it's my turn
[52:29] to invite him
[52:30] how many times did okay all right i
[52:33] gotta
[52:34] i gotta catch up oh my goodness that's
[52:36] not agape love that's feeli
[52:38] that's only merely filial love that's
[52:40] what the world does
[52:41] we gotta we've got to give back what
[52:45] we've been given
[52:46] whether whatever whatever that might be
[52:49] good bad or ugly
[52:52] but agape love says it doesn't really
[52:55] matter what
[52:56] they do that's how real friendship
[52:58] happens when everybody says
[53:00] it doesn't really matter what they do
[53:03] how they do but i love them
[53:07] anyways because they're a son of god a
[53:10] daughter of god
[53:11] and they have a need and i'm looking
[53:13] beyond mere flesh
[53:15] life and i'm looking to that soul
[53:18] that's in connection with christ that
[53:21] soul is worth
[53:22] ten thousand worlds even that is an
[53:24] understatement
[53:26] it's way more than that in god's eyes
[53:30] it's infinite value why is it have
[53:32] infinite value because
[53:34] he came in the form of his son
[53:37] to die on the cross so that soul would
[53:39] be saved
[53:41] so what kind of value should we place on
[53:43] one another
[53:45] amen lord help us to increase more and
[53:48] more
[53:50] the christian ethic is not selfish
[53:55] it's not let every man seek his own good
[53:58] that's what the world does that's what
[54:00] our carnal nature
[54:02] teaches us to do brother michael sent me
[54:04] a text
[54:06] last week that was so so good he was
[54:08] talking about it was talking about
[54:09] satanism
[54:10] and how in in the satanic bible
[54:14] they have this approach where everything
[54:16] is natural we think of it
[54:18] everything is maybe it's supernatural
[54:21] everything is just natural
[54:22] appealing to the flesh of man
[54:26] their idea is do unto others
[54:29] as they do to you that's the world's
[54:32] pattern and program
[54:34] if they're evil to you pay it back if
[54:36] they're good to you
[54:37] pay it back well real brother branham
[54:40] says the greatest power that we have
[54:43] greatest weapon that's been given to us
[54:45] is love
[54:46] so if we want to fight the devil
[54:49] how would we do it take up take up the
[54:52] sword of the spirit
[54:53] but we also take up what love
[54:56] love our enemies when we do unto others
[54:59] as we would have them do unto us
[55:01] it's actually we're taking a part in a
[55:04] spiritual battle
[55:05] by the holy spirit we are engaging in
[55:09] warfare against the world we're saying
[55:11] no satan i'm not following your ways no
[55:14] satan
[55:15] i'm not engaging in the warfare that you
[55:18] want me to be
[55:18] work with you i'm working with jesus
[55:21] christ
[55:22] and that means when this person curses
[55:24] me i will bless them
[55:27] and when we do that we actually fight
[55:30] that
[55:30] real warfare that takes place brother
[55:33] branham talks about that
[55:35] um frequently but he talks about that
[55:38] and he
[55:39] he's advising different the husband
[55:42] where he's
[55:43] his wife starts talking against the
[55:45] service i suppose he spoke in tongues
[55:47] and rolled on the floor
[55:49] and he said i just the husband was like
[55:50] i just started rebuking that devil
[55:52] satan i cast you out get up he's like
[55:55] brother branham we're going to get a
[55:56] divorce
[55:57] he's like sure sure you are that's
[56:00] that's
[56:01] completely the wrong way to do it when
[56:03] she does that so oh honey that's all
[56:04] right
[56:05] that's all right and do be kind to her
[56:08] treat her nice
[56:09] and he comes back later and says brother
[56:11] branham our
[56:12] the home is revolutionized so i told
[56:18] he said how what do you think is going
[56:19] to win the battle fussing and fighting
[56:22] no it's love and so that's
[56:25] that's so important for us to understand
[56:28] our battle
[56:28] is not with flesh and blood
[56:32] when somebody does you wrong when
[56:33] somebody speaks against you when
[56:35] somebody
[56:36] lies about you it might even be a good
[56:38] believer
[56:40] right it might be a good believer that's
[56:42] hurt you say that's all right
[56:44] they didn't mean that isn't that what
[56:47] jesus did
[56:48] brother branham told us they didn't mean
[56:50] that and don't spread it around
[56:51] don't talk about it pray for him right
[56:54] away
[56:56] why do we do that again it goes back to
[56:58] what we're we were saying
[57:00] satan's tactics are repay
[57:03] the person for what they did to you good
[57:07] or bad but god's tactic is
[57:10] when they do not do not be overcome by
[57:13] evil
[57:14] how are you overcome by evil by engaging
[57:16] in evil for evil
[57:18] contrary wise repay evil with
[57:22] good isn't that beautiful
[57:26] i always remember that little children's
[57:29] song
[57:30] my uh my little one kid one person was
[57:33] talking about
[57:34] worldly things and so forth and my my
[57:36] little
[57:37] nephew at the time he was little started
[57:40] singing
[57:41] do not be do not be overcome by evil
[57:44] but overcome evil with good and the guy
[57:47] was just like
[57:48] okay well i'm sufficiently rebuked
[57:56] he didn't even know what he was doing
[57:57] but it was the spirit of the lord
[57:58] correcting that man
[58:01] let every man seek not his own good
[58:05] but the good of others this is what
[58:09] we as believers have to be
[58:12] engaged in this has to be our focus
[58:15] okay that doesn't mean we don't provide
[58:18] for our family
[58:20] you know all these things together in
[58:22] balance if you don't provide for
[58:24] your family are you seeking the good of
[58:25] your family
[58:27] no no if you want to excel in your job
[58:32] you do it for the glory of god and to do
[58:34] what to help other people
[58:36] to be a blessing to other people if you
[58:38] want to make more money
[58:39] don't do it for selfish ambition do it
[58:42] so that you can give more and be more of
[58:44] a blessing
[58:45] and to be a channel so it doesn't mean
[58:47] that you're not supposed to
[58:49] ask for a raise at the job
[58:52] you're supposed to you should not for
[58:55] yourself
[58:56] for other people don't seek your own
[58:58] good but the good of others
[58:59] that also means your family sometimes we
[59:02] lose track of that
[59:03] we're supposed to seek the good of our
[59:05] family
[59:07] and then the good of others we're
[59:09] supposed to love
[59:12] one another fervently when we're also
[59:14] supposed to love the world
[59:16] love the people in the world amen
[59:20] so it all of these things there's a
[59:22] scriptural balance
[59:24] in all of it and we can't get out of
[59:26] whack with that
[59:27] when we get out of whack that's when we
[59:29] bring hurt
[59:30] hurt to our family hurt to those around
[59:32] us you also can go in the other
[59:34] direction be so focused on your family
[59:37] that you have no time to serve the
[59:40] people around you
[59:41] no time to love the people around you
[59:43] because your whole
[59:44] soul focus is just all i do is spend
[59:47] time on my family and i
[59:49] i don't focus on how i can be a blessing
[59:52] outside of that
[59:53] so again all of that has to be taken
[59:56] into consideration
[59:57] how do we balance it out jason i don't
[59:59] have an equation
[1:00:00] but i have a person
[1:00:03] that's the holy ghost the holy ghost
[1:00:06] will balance you out amen and all of
[1:00:09] these things and he'll correct you on
[1:00:10] one side
[1:00:11] and he'll correct you on the other side
[1:00:13] that's what we have to have
[1:00:16] all right so just like nature
[1:00:20] what hap what happens what would happen
[1:00:21] to this facility here
[1:00:24] if we just stopped maintaining it all
[1:00:26] together
[1:00:27] didn't cut the grass didn't trim the
[1:00:29] trees didn't trim the bushes
[1:00:31] didn't clean what would happen over time
[1:00:34] nature would reclaim it it would be wild
[1:00:38] what happens to friendships and
[1:00:40] relationships
[1:00:43] when we don't tend to them when we don't
[1:00:46] take
[1:00:46] time for them
[1:00:49] they get wild they go they go like this
[1:00:53] they go far apart their distance
[1:00:56] past hurts how many have had hurts if
[1:00:59] you don't raise your hand you're lying
[1:01:03] we have all had past hurts we've all had
[1:01:05] past frustrations
[1:01:07] from churches from family
[1:01:10] from best friends betrayals
[1:01:14] the list goes on remember that christ
[1:01:17] had it too
[1:01:18] he already experienced that too and it
[1:01:21] didn't stop him from doing what god
[1:01:23] wanted him to do
[1:01:25] no matter how bad it hurt he was first
[1:01:27] smite the shepherd and the sheep will be
[1:01:29] scattered
[1:01:30] his closest friends have completely
[1:01:32] abandoned him
[1:01:34] one of his inner circle his closest
[1:01:37] group
[1:01:37] of friends peter did what denied he even
[1:01:40] knew
[1:01:41] him that's crucial
[1:01:43] [Music]
[1:01:44] that is unbelievable imagine imagine if
[1:01:47] your best friend
[1:01:48] came i don't know i don't even know who
[1:01:50] that is wow
[1:01:52] that's betray that's real betrayal so
[1:01:55] don't think
[1:01:56] that christ doesn't know he's a high
[1:01:59] priest that can be touched by the
[1:02:00] feeling of your infirmities
[1:02:02] the worst betrayal you can imagine he's
[1:02:05] experienced it
[1:02:06] yeah and guess what it never stopped him
[1:02:09] or derailed him from following god's
[1:02:11] plan
[1:02:12] and it can't do that for us does it hurt
[1:02:15] does it make us nervous
[1:02:16] does it make us upset does it make us
[1:02:18] frustrated
[1:02:20] yep should it stop us from doing what
[1:02:23] god
[1:02:23] wants us to do do not let it do that
[1:02:27] that's what satan wants
[1:02:30] sometimes whereas the worst wounds that
[1:02:32] christ got in the house of his friends
[1:02:35] sometimes god allows people that we
[1:02:38] respect that we know are real believers
[1:02:41] that we know have an experience with god
[1:02:44] to lash out and hurt us what do we do
[1:02:47] how do we respond
[1:02:49] what what should we do
[1:02:53] it's simple it's simple love them we sh
[1:02:56] it shouldn't change our love
[1:02:58] paul said even though you i'll gladly
[1:03:00] spend and be spent for you
[1:03:02] even though you love me less i will love
[1:03:04] you more amen
[1:03:07] okay that's contrary to what i'm feeling
[1:03:10] on the inside
[1:03:11] well let the holy spirit take away that
[1:03:14] feeling
[1:03:16] pray ask the lord to help you because
[1:03:19] we're all subject we're all subject to
[1:03:22] like
[1:03:23] passions like elijah was
[1:03:26] we're all subject to those feelings but
[1:03:29] we're not supposed
[1:03:30] to give in to those feelings because we
[1:03:32] have the holy spirit
[1:03:34] within us that gives us power to
[1:03:37] overcome
[1:03:38] human reactions and feelings amen
[1:03:42] john 15 15.
[1:03:48] henceforth i call you not servants
[1:03:51] for the servant knoweth not what his
[1:03:53] lord doeth
[1:03:56] but i've called you friends for all
[1:03:58] things that i have heard of my father
[1:04:01] i have made known unto you
[1:04:05] isn't that beautiful i don't call you
[1:04:08] servants anymore i'm calling you my
[1:04:10] friends what is the definition of
[1:04:12] friendship jesus
[1:04:15] all things i've heard of my father i
[1:04:16] made an own unto you what
[1:04:18] that's ultimate friendship what do we
[1:04:20] have with jesus christ
[1:04:22] ultimate friendship it's we can bear
[1:04:25] all of our burdens all of our struggles
[1:04:28] all of our trials we can expose
[1:04:29] ourselves completely to him
[1:04:31] and he will expose himself completely
[1:04:34] his heart
[1:04:35] to us and that's really what changes us
[1:04:38] and think about that in the realm of us
[1:04:42] to one another what does that mean
[1:04:46] it's opening up your heart and your
[1:04:48] secrets
[1:04:49] to another person you say
[1:04:54] i don't know if i want to do that
[1:05:00] well it is carry risk with it
[1:05:04] it carried great risk to it with jesus
[1:05:07] christ
[1:05:09] but when two hearts are connected
[1:05:11] together
[1:05:13] there's a real love that flows forth
[1:05:16] we'll talk
[1:05:16] we'll read that scripture later about
[1:05:19] jonathan and david
[1:05:21] and how god worked through that but a
[1:05:24] real biblical friendship is opening up
[1:05:26] our hearts to one another
[1:05:29] that's a real biblical friendship and
[1:05:31] praying for one another
[1:05:32] and correcting each other when we need
[1:05:34] correction with love
[1:05:36] and encouraging one another building
[1:05:39] each other up
[1:05:41] it demands loyalty and it also demands
[1:05:45] trustworthiness
[1:05:47] it demands continually fighting the
[1:05:49] spirit of gossip
[1:05:51] you've all experienced the spirit of
[1:05:53] gossip
[1:05:55] we all of us without exception and the
[1:05:58] spirit of gossip we want to tell
[1:06:00] something
[1:06:01] and it brings a satisfaction to the
[1:06:03] flesh
[1:06:04] because you've shared some secret
[1:06:06] information
[1:06:08] with other people but what does that do
[1:06:11] does that build someone up
[1:06:15] 99.9 of the time it doesn't
[1:06:18] it it it damages friendships it
[1:06:21] it it brings hurt
[1:06:24] because because that person was trusting
[1:06:28] you
[1:06:29] to be honest and to not share things
[1:06:33] so we have to fight that spirit of god
[1:06:35] gossip
[1:06:36] and again it opens us to the possibility
[1:06:39] of being hurt
[1:06:40] and to having our trust broken
[1:06:44] but it should not that this should not
[1:06:46] stop us
[1:06:47] that should not prevent us
[1:06:50] because it exposed jesus christ to the
[1:06:52] same thing
[1:06:53] it didn't stop him he made himself
[1:06:56] transparent to us
[1:06:58] and for us and what did it get him
[1:07:03] amen he was killed
[1:07:07] he was executed for it it didn't stop
[1:07:10] him
[1:07:10] [Music]
[1:07:11] that's the kind of friendship that god
[1:07:13] wants us to have with one another
[1:07:16] you say that's difficult that's hard yes
[1:07:19] absolutely it is
[1:07:21] but it's real friendship and it's
[1:07:23] transforming
[1:07:24] friendship we look at ministry
[1:07:28] for example we're all we talked about in
[1:07:30] sunday school we're all called we're
[1:07:33] we're a royal priesthood we're all
[1:07:35] called
[1:07:36] to have a ministry a service to one
[1:07:39] another
[1:07:40] right and we look at that well i have to
[1:07:43] have a degree in
[1:07:44] counseling people and i've got to be
[1:07:45] able to
[1:07:47] that's just friendship that's just
[1:07:49] listening that's just
[1:07:50] caring that's just trying to understand
[1:07:54] the person's heart sometimes
[1:07:56] i've seen it all over the place on the
[1:07:58] missions field here
[1:08:00] everywhere a person says i need
[1:08:02] counseling they come and they talk
[1:08:04] and they talk and they talk and they
[1:08:06] talk and i all don't even say anything
[1:08:09] and at the end they say thank you for
[1:08:11] ministering to me
[1:08:14] you're welcome you're welcome
[1:08:18] i didn't do anything they just needed to
[1:08:20] get it off their chest that's okay
[1:08:22] they trusted me to do that now what do i
[1:08:24] do next
[1:08:26] pray for him keep my mouth quiet
[1:08:30] that's friendship it's not really
[1:08:32] complicated we want to make
[1:08:34] counsel there's a counseling session
[1:08:36] there was this and i told him
[1:08:38] that's just the holy spirit in you
[1:08:41] loving the person pointing them to the
[1:08:43] scripture
[1:08:44] it's really not complicated it's for all
[1:08:46] of us to be a part of
[1:08:48] spiritual gifts are for the whole body
[1:08:49] of christ
[1:08:51] not just for the preacher amen
[1:08:55] the true servant the heart of a true
[1:08:57] servant says i will lay down
[1:08:59] my life for my brothers and sisters
[1:09:06] we're ready to do maybe we're ready to
[1:09:08] do that as far as like physically
[1:09:10] but what about spiritually what about
[1:09:12] emotionally
[1:09:14] what about on a daily basis not the it's
[1:09:16] not the big confrontation
[1:09:18] but it's the things of just caring for
[1:09:21] each other
[1:09:23] just following up saying you know he was
[1:09:26] having a hard time
[1:09:27] how are you doing today you know just
[1:09:30] showing a little bit of concern
[1:09:33] and care for people go
[1:09:36] go such a far away to heal
[1:09:39] hurts
[1:09:42] and sometimes people are
[1:09:46] so broken you feel like i can't open
[1:09:48] myself up to anyone
[1:09:49] and even when i'm talking right now
[1:09:51] maybe you have such a
[1:09:53] such a wall in front of you you're like
[1:09:55] you're almost not even hearing what i'm
[1:09:56] saying because it's
[1:09:58] it's such a scary thing to even talk
[1:10:00] about
[1:10:03] um the lord wants to heal you
[1:10:07] the lord wants to heal that he doesn't
[1:10:10] want you to be in that
[1:10:12] condition where you have a wall around
[1:10:14] your heart amen
[1:10:16] they say it's too dangerous i can't
[1:10:17] trust people i'm not asking you to trust
[1:10:20] people i'm asking you to trust the lord
[1:10:24] trust the lord that he has your best in
[1:10:26] mind
[1:10:28] and ask the lord to heal you but beyond
[1:10:32] that
[1:10:32] ask the lord to send a real friend to
[1:10:35] you that would listen and would care
[1:10:38] because many times more times
[1:10:41] often than not that is what brings
[1:10:44] healing
[1:10:44] to people just an individual that says i
[1:10:48] care
[1:10:48] enough to close my mouth
[1:10:52] my one mouth and use my two ears to
[1:10:55] listen to what's being said
[1:10:58] and and and not i don't have to fix
[1:11:01] whatever the problem is
[1:11:03] i just have to care and then after that
[1:11:06] after i listen and after i understood i
[1:11:09] can really help someone
[1:11:13] and the bible puts a great deal of value
[1:11:16] upon that kind of friendship
[1:11:18] we mentioned before david and jonathan
[1:11:20] first samuel 18 verse 1
[1:11:24] and it came to pass when he had made an
[1:11:26] end of speaking unto saul that the soul
[1:11:28] of jonathan
[1:11:30] was knit with the soul of david and
[1:11:34] jonathan
[1:11:34] loved him as his own soul what was
[1:11:36] happening here
[1:11:38] david was testifying and saying
[1:11:41] i can i can kill this goliath
[1:11:45] i can i can come against him because he
[1:11:48] god helped me with the bear
[1:11:50] so god can do it with this uncircumcised
[1:11:53] philistine
[1:11:54] jonathan saw that and immediately that's
[1:11:56] my that that is
[1:11:58] me that is me
[1:12:01] we are one here in our faith in god
[1:12:05] and they loved each other as their own
[1:12:08] very own soul and then we go on and see
[1:12:12] what great length that jonathan went
[1:12:15] to protect and be a real friend i mean
[1:12:19] he stuck his neck out with his own
[1:12:20] father he knew his father was unjust
[1:12:24] and what he was doing towards david so
[1:12:26] he was willing to sacrifice
[1:12:28] everything knowing knowing
[1:12:31] it wasn't a mystery knowing that david
[1:12:34] was anointed to be the next king
[1:12:36] jonathan said i know i'm supposed to be
[1:12:38] in the monarchy and
[1:12:40] i'll be the next one that comes up but
[1:12:42] i'm going to sacrifice everything for
[1:12:43] david
[1:12:44] who's going to take my place now that is
[1:12:48] love
[1:12:50] amen that is real love philemon 1
[1:12:55] 10 through 12. i'll just read it real
[1:12:56] quick i appealed to you from my child
[1:12:58] onesimus
[1:12:59] whose father i became in my imprisonment
[1:13:02] formerly he was useless
[1:13:04] to you but now he is indeed useful to
[1:13:06] you and to me
[1:13:07] i am sending him back to you sending my
[1:13:10] very
[1:13:11] heart isn't that beautiful what a
[1:13:14] friendship that
[1:13:15] paul had developed with philemon there
[1:13:20] in rome he said he could say this is
[1:13:23] this man is my very heart
[1:13:26] think about that proverbs 17
[1:13:30] verse 17.
[1:13:37] a friend loveth at all times
[1:13:40] and a brother is born for
[1:13:43] adversity a real friend
[1:13:47] loves at all times why does it say loves
[1:13:49] at all times because there's lots of ups
[1:13:51] and downs
[1:13:52] in life in friendship hey has anyone
[1:13:55] ever had a really close friend and
[1:13:57] something happened and you misunderstood
[1:13:58] what happened
[1:14:00] and you thought that they were upset
[1:14:03] with you
[1:14:03] or they were distancing themselves from
[1:14:06] you you ever had that happen
[1:14:08] did it make you stop loving that person
[1:14:11] i hope not
[1:14:12] i hope not many times
[1:14:17] you you go and talk to that person and
[1:14:18] what happens completely had no
[1:14:20] you completely misunderstood the
[1:14:22] situation
[1:14:24] just talk just talk to each other just
[1:14:26] communicate
[1:14:28] that's part of being a real friend
[1:14:30] friend loves at all times don't
[1:14:32] misconstrue the behavior of another
[1:14:34] person based on your own opinion
[1:14:36] get it out of their own mouth
[1:14:39] get it out of their own mouth i think
[1:14:42] that's a wonderful
[1:14:44] wonderful thing that we have to do for
[1:14:46] one another
[1:14:48] a friend loves you when you have no
[1:14:50] money
[1:14:52] and a friend loves you when you have a
[1:14:54] little bit of money
[1:14:56] and a friend loves you when you have
[1:14:58] lots of money
[1:14:59] he always loves you that it
[1:15:03] that should not change love i mean we
[1:15:05] live in a world
[1:15:07] where people will see oh it's a rich guy
[1:15:10] man i love him
[1:15:13] man i want to be close to him and then
[1:15:17] the request comes it's not real
[1:15:20] friendship
[1:15:21] friend loves that person don't matter
[1:15:24] what their situation is in life is
[1:15:27] uh job 19 verse 14.
[1:15:36] job came to this place where he realized
[1:15:40] his friends weren't his friends
[1:15:42] my kins folk have failed and my familiar
[1:15:44] friends have forgotten me
[1:15:47] when job was prosperous oh man
[1:15:50] job's a good guy he's the best guy
[1:15:53] around
[1:15:54] he throws the best parties and
[1:15:58] he has he has the best the funnest
[1:16:00] things to do at his
[1:16:02] home but then he lost everything and
[1:16:04] what happened
[1:16:05] i abandoned him that's not real
[1:16:07] friendship
[1:16:08] a real friend loves at all times
[1:16:11] brother branham in lifting him up out of
[1:16:13] history in 1958 says
[1:16:15] seems like that real family love doesn't
[1:16:17] exist anymore
[1:16:18] just something has happened home life is
[1:16:20] running out we don't have the old
[1:16:21] american home as we used to have it long
[1:16:23] years ago
[1:16:24] there's another thing that i would like
[1:16:26] to say is another thing that is running
[1:16:27] out is friendship is running out
[1:16:29] it don't seem like we have the friends
[1:16:31] that we used to have and the friends
[1:16:32] that we have
[1:16:33] are not loyal friends like used to be it
[1:16:36] used to be i can remember when someone
[1:16:37] got sick in the neighborhood that
[1:16:39] everybody
[1:16:40] come around and they helped with all
[1:16:42] help them with all their work
[1:16:44] and landed a hand anything could be done
[1:16:46] set up with them all night at a time as
[1:16:48] i've often said it's truth that we
[1:16:49] hardly know the neighbor is dead
[1:16:51] until we see it in the paper so brother
[1:16:54] branham speaks about friendship and he
[1:16:55] speaks about
[1:16:56] loyalty service and sacrifice
[1:17:00] amen i i really like that how he brought
[1:17:04] that out
[1:17:05] loyalty it's not there's not the loyalty
[1:17:07] of friendship
[1:17:08] they go over and they lend a hand and
[1:17:11] they get their work done that's
[1:17:12] sacrifice because you got your own work
[1:17:14] to get done at your home and you go and
[1:17:16] help them with their work
[1:17:19] loyalty service sacrifice proverbs
[1:17:22] 27 verse 10.
[1:17:29] thine own friend and thy father's friend
[1:17:31] forsake not
[1:17:33] neither go into thy brother's house in
[1:17:35] the day of calamity for better as a
[1:17:36] neighbor that is near
[1:17:38] than a brother that is far off so
[1:17:42] i want to kind of leave that last part
[1:17:44] alone or that verse but
[1:17:45] the main thing i want to look at is do
[1:17:47] not leave
[1:17:48] forsake or desert your friend
[1:17:53] the bible commands it did you realize
[1:17:55] that don't forsake your friend amen
[1:17:59] that's a commandment from scripture now
[1:18:01] okay
[1:18:02] let's let's look at the bigger picture
[1:18:05] let's look at a big picture
[1:18:06] here young people what kind of friends
[1:18:09] do you have
[1:18:11] the bible says not to be unequally yoked
[1:18:13] together with unbelievers
[1:18:16] so it's not talking about it's it's it's
[1:18:19] talking about a real friend
[1:18:21] it's not talking about a fake friend
[1:18:23] it's talking not talking about the wrong
[1:18:25] kind of friends
[1:18:26] again we're not to be unequally yoked
[1:18:30] does that mean i can't have a friend
[1:18:32] that's an unbeliever
[1:18:34] it doesn't mean that but it means you
[1:18:37] can't be unequally
[1:18:38] yoked with them what does that mean let
[1:18:41] me break it down
[1:18:44] when i got saved i had a lot of friends
[1:18:47] around me what did they like to do
[1:18:48] the things that i liked to do before i
[1:18:50] got saved
[1:18:52] which were bad habits bad things
[1:18:56] so what was the norm of my relationship
[1:18:58] we were in a yoke together
[1:19:00] doing the same things together i got
[1:19:03] saved
[1:19:04] and i was like oh these are my buddies
[1:19:05] i'll continue to hang out with them
[1:19:07] what happened when i wasn't fully
[1:19:09] sanctified yet
[1:19:10] i started to do what drink
[1:19:14] say words that i didn't want to say do
[1:19:16] things i didn't want to do
[1:19:19] what was the result conviction
[1:19:22] frustration upset what did i do
[1:19:26] lord help me lord help me and then what
[1:19:28] did i do the next day
[1:19:29] hung out with those friends again and
[1:19:31] the lord's saying
[1:19:32] i can't help you you got to do something
[1:19:34] yourself here
[1:19:37] so i remember speaking about this to my
[1:19:39] my brother-in-law
[1:19:40] and we went to uh we went to the church
[1:19:44] and
[1:19:45] on a saturday night and the minister
[1:19:47] started speaking about being
[1:19:48] unequally yoked together with
[1:19:50] unbelievers and
[1:19:54] he was saying you know you got you get
[1:19:56] saved and you're continuing on the same
[1:19:59] behavior as you were before you're saved
[1:20:01] because your friends are dragging you
[1:20:02] into the same
[1:20:04] behaviors well he said here's
[1:20:07] here's the step to not be unequally
[1:20:09] yoked
[1:20:10] go to your friends and say ah christ has
[1:20:12] changed my life
[1:20:14] i don't want to live that way anymore i
[1:20:16] don't want to smoke marijuana i don't
[1:20:17] want to party i don't want to cuss i
[1:20:18] don't want to listen to that music
[1:20:20] i don't want to go to the dance club i
[1:20:21] don't want to just list
[1:20:23] off whatever it is that you don't want
[1:20:24] to have in your life
[1:20:26] and then say i want you to help me
[1:20:30] live a godly life strange thing to say
[1:20:33] but
[1:20:34] understand i want you to help me make
[1:20:37] the choices
[1:20:38] that you know i want to make
[1:20:41] if you don't want to be friends anymore
[1:20:43] that's fine that's your choice
[1:20:45] i want to be your friend but i cannot go
[1:20:48] and do those things anymore and be
[1:20:50] specific
[1:20:52] help me not do them
[1:20:55] if we can if you want to do that we can
[1:20:57] continue to continue being friends
[1:20:58] if you don't want to do that we'll just
[1:21:01] shake hands
[1:21:02] give a hug and part our ways so
[1:21:06] i did that all my friends said oh yeah
[1:21:08] of course i want to be your friend
[1:21:11] of course i want to still be with you
[1:21:14] only one friend continued with me after
[1:21:16] that
[1:21:17] that's okay that's okay because one
[1:21:20] person decided i want to be a true
[1:21:22] friend
[1:21:23] i want to help him with what he wants
[1:21:26] help with
[1:21:27] the rest of them left me behind but what
[1:21:29] happens
[1:21:30] it gives you an opportunity to witness
[1:21:33] and it changes you from being yoked
[1:21:35] together it takes the yolk and it goes
[1:21:38] boom breaks it into pieces on the floor
[1:21:41] why because now
[1:21:42] you're the one influencing them
[1:21:45] not them influencing you on an equal
[1:21:48] level you've broken that
[1:21:50] yoke continue to be friends you're just
[1:21:52] not going to do the things that you used
[1:21:53] to do
[1:21:55] you can get together you can talk but
[1:21:57] what are you going to
[1:21:58] probably talk about different things
[1:22:00] you're going to talk about the lord
[1:22:01] you're going to pray for them
[1:22:03] you're going to talk about what god is
[1:22:04] doing in your life you're going to talk
[1:22:05] about what you're learning from the
[1:22:06] from the word of god amen you're not
[1:22:09] going to continue to go back to what it
[1:22:11] was before
[1:22:12] right well you have to
[1:22:15] you have to decide to do that you have
[1:22:18] to make the steps to do that
[1:22:20] so when we're saying forsake not your
[1:22:22] friend we mean a real friend
[1:22:25] a real friend that wants you to live a
[1:22:28] godly life that wants to help you
[1:22:30] get closer to christ that's a real
[1:22:32] friend
[1:22:35] uh james 1 verse 19.
[1:22:40] i'll just read it real quick no my
[1:22:42] beloved brothers let every person be
[1:22:43] quick to hear slow to speak
[1:22:45] slow to wrath or slow to
[1:22:48] anger we spoke about that before
[1:22:53] be fast to hear
[1:22:56] listen quickly don't speak quickly
[1:23:00] listen quickly and after you've listened
[1:23:04] then be slow to speak and
[1:23:08] slow to anger
[1:23:11] that's that's a real quality of
[1:23:13] friendship job
[1:23:16] 6 verse 14.
[1:23:27] to him that is afflicted pity should be
[1:23:30] showed from his friend
[1:23:32] but he forsaketh the fear of the
[1:23:34] almighty
[1:23:35] so let me let me break that down a
[1:23:38] little bit
[1:23:39] basically what's being said is he who
[1:23:42] withholds kindness
[1:23:46] from a friend is forsaking the fear
[1:23:50] of the almighty wow
[1:23:54] if there is someone that needs a
[1:23:56] kindness done to them
[1:23:57] and you look and say god bless you
[1:24:00] and don't do anything about it you're
[1:24:03] not fearing god anymore
[1:24:04] you're not reverencing god right
[1:24:08] john speaks about that in his epistle if
[1:24:11] you
[1:24:12] you basically say god bless you and shut
[1:24:14] up your bowels of confession and do
[1:24:15] nothing
[1:24:16] for them how is the love of god dwelling
[1:24:18] in you
[1:24:20] true love a true friend
[1:24:24] does what helps the one who's in need
[1:24:28] reaches out doesn't just i don't have
[1:24:30] time for that
[1:24:33] do you fear god then you should have
[1:24:35] time for it
[1:24:37] amen
[1:24:40] proverbs 27 verse nine
[1:24:46] in other words how we treat others
[1:24:50] is a direct reflection of how we feel
[1:24:53] about
[1:24:53] god amen right
[1:24:57] if we see someone in need don't do
[1:24:58] anything it shows
[1:25:00] your feeling is very weak for god
[1:25:04] ointment and perfume rejoice the heart
[1:25:07] sowed out the sweetness of a man's
[1:25:09] friend
[1:25:10] by hearty counsel
[1:25:13] hold that in your mind then go back to
[1:25:15] verse six
[1:25:19] faithful are the wounds of a friend but
[1:25:21] the kisses of an enemy
[1:25:22] are deceitful
[1:25:26] so a friend is someone you can turn to
[1:25:28] for advice they understand you they care
[1:25:30] for you
[1:25:31] they can help with encouragement or
[1:25:33] loving rebuke
[1:25:34] faithful are the wounds of a friend
[1:25:36] that's speaking about a friend who
[1:25:39] tells you the truth when you're doing
[1:25:42] the wrong thing
[1:25:42] thinking the wrong thing they speak the
[1:25:45] truth to you that's a real friend
[1:25:47] that's right but the kisses of an enemy
[1:25:49] are deceitful in other words it's
[1:25:50] talking about
[1:25:51] correction versus flattery we are
[1:25:54] supposed to encourage one another
[1:25:56] we're supposed to build each other up
[1:25:57] we're supposed to recognize
[1:25:59] when someone does something that's a
[1:26:01] blessing that's helpful
[1:26:02] we're not supposed to not do that we are
[1:26:05] we're supposed to
[1:26:06] reach out thank you for doing that we
[1:26:08] enjoyed that or we appreciated that we
[1:26:10] enjoyed that special
[1:26:11] thank you for we're supposed to
[1:26:13] appreciate one another but if it's just
[1:26:15] flattering flattering flattering then
[1:26:16] you're just waiting for what's next
[1:26:19] what's next it's not a real it's not a
[1:26:23] real
[1:26:23] a real friendship will build you up and
[1:26:26] also
[1:26:27] give you a wound what does it mean give
[1:26:29] you a wound
[1:26:30] correction yeah say that's not right
[1:26:34] you shouldn't you shouldn't you
[1:26:35] shouldn't be thinking that way or you
[1:26:36] shouldn't be acting that way or
[1:26:37] shouldn't be talking that way you
[1:26:38] shouldn't have done that
[1:26:40] and the person will will say
[1:26:43] yeah thank you you're right that hurts
[1:26:47] ouch it's a wound but it's it's a
[1:26:50] faithful wound
[1:26:51] amen because it's meant to help you get
[1:26:54] closer to christ
[1:26:56] that's a real friend
[1:27:01] and again i know religious spirits can
[1:27:04] latch onto that
[1:27:05] thing only and say love is corrective
[1:27:08] and therefore they go around to everyone
[1:27:10] judging and beating them up with their
[1:27:13] words
[1:27:14] and say oh i i have real love for you
[1:27:17] i'm telling
[1:27:18] you the truth no you're just ornery
[1:27:24] you're just mean rude disrespectful
[1:27:28] etc no it's not that's not it it's
[1:27:31] there's a heart of compassion when the
[1:27:34] correction comes
[1:27:35] when there's a heart of compassion and
[1:27:38] the words of correction come
[1:27:39] the person hearing it might not love it
[1:27:43] but they're not going to say that person
[1:27:44] hates me
[1:27:46] no they're going to feel that there's
[1:27:49] love there
[1:27:50] proverbs 17 verse 9
[1:27:59] he that covereth a transgression seeks
[1:28:01] love
[1:28:02] but he that repeateth a matter
[1:28:04] separateth
[1:28:05] very friends
[1:28:08] love covers a multitude of sins is how
[1:28:11] the new testament writers refer to this
[1:28:16] aren't we supposed to expose the
[1:28:18] unfruitful works of
[1:28:19] darkness so how do we
[1:28:23] how do we grab this verse and that verse
[1:28:26] and go in the right direction here
[1:28:30] jesus very clearly makes that known
[1:28:33] matthew 17 i believe it is
[1:28:35] and he says when your brother is
[1:28:39] in a fault go to him directly
[1:28:42] speak to him if he doesn't receive it
[1:28:45] get someone else
[1:28:47] preferably someone that's a witness
[1:28:49] bring them with and confront him
[1:28:50] they don't receive that then tell it to
[1:28:52] the church
[1:28:54] and if they don't receive it then then
[1:28:55] treat them like
[1:28:57] a tax collector or a sinner
[1:29:01] that's what you run from a tax collector
[1:29:08] right
[1:29:11] so again
[1:29:15] love covers a multitude of sins as soon
[1:29:17] as we find out about someone
[1:29:19] usually this is what happens you find
[1:29:22] out about what so so-and-so did
[1:29:23] through the grapevine and then you want
[1:29:26] to blast it out
[1:29:28] on facebook or on whatever it is
[1:29:31] it's not love that's stupidity ignorance
[1:29:34] and hatred
[1:29:37] the real response would be either say
[1:29:40] ignore it or say i heard this i'm going
[1:29:42] directly to the person
[1:29:45] that's the real loving response
[1:29:48] but unfortunately it's way easier to do
[1:29:50] the other thing
[1:29:54] love cover it covers a multitude of sins
[1:29:56] i hope you understand it a little bit
[1:29:58] better now
[1:29:59] love seized someone else and not only
[1:30:02] that but you might see someone and say
[1:30:03] my goodness why are they doing that
[1:30:06] that's just wrong so what's the response
[1:30:09] what's the reaction to tell everybo
[1:30:11] you know so-and-so is doing such and
[1:30:12] such no
[1:30:15] it should be let's pray for them i'm
[1:30:17] going to pray for them in secret
[1:30:19] to see what the lord would work in their
[1:30:21] life you don't have to
[1:30:23] you don't have to run and act upon every
[1:30:25] judgment that you make
[1:30:26] a lot of times your judgment's wrong
[1:30:29] we're human we're in flesh
[1:30:31] we might have or we might it might be
[1:30:32] partially right
[1:30:36] and so the the best response when we see
[1:30:38] things to do is say
[1:30:39] lord help them lord help me to know what
[1:30:42] to do
[1:30:43] how many times any of you have
[1:30:46] experienced this that you saw something
[1:30:48] and you're like oh i got to do something
[1:30:50] and then the lord says
[1:30:51] did you pray and then you pray
[1:30:54] and then what the lord says to do
[1:30:57] nothing
[1:31:00] just keep praying and then you watch and
[1:31:02] see my goodness
[1:31:04] god is changing that
[1:31:07] god want that that's the priesthood of
[1:31:09] all believers
[1:31:11] [Music]
[1:31:12] not sometimes we do have to talk to them
[1:31:14] i'm not saying we don't
[1:31:16] but i'm saying god knows the answer to
[1:31:18] that question
[1:31:20] you might want to ask him first
[1:31:23] proverbs 16 28.
[1:31:35] a dishonest man a forward man a
[1:31:38] dishonest man
[1:31:40] sows or spreads strife
[1:31:44] and a whisper whisperer separates
[1:31:48] chief friends or close
[1:31:51] friends do we want to be
[1:31:55] sowers of strife are
[1:31:58] sowers of the word
[1:32:01] do we want to be peacemakers
[1:32:05] or separators these things are so
[1:32:10] really simple i sometimes i feel like my
[1:32:13] goodness what there's all these
[1:32:15] wonderful things to preach about in the
[1:32:17] message and here i am
[1:32:18] preaching on this simple thing why am i
[1:32:20] preaching on this simple thing
[1:32:22] i don't think we're doing it very well
[1:32:25] we're not doing it as well as we need to
[1:32:27] i'm not
[1:32:29] doing it as well as i need to
[1:32:33] and we get caught up in all the
[1:32:35] mysteries
[1:32:36] and we leave off the very very simple
[1:32:39] things of christianity
[1:32:42] i love the mysteries i mean you're not
[1:32:44] you should understand you know me
[1:32:46] i lo i love them i would really like to
[1:32:49] be preaching on them right now
[1:32:51] but that's not what god asked me to
[1:32:52] speak about
[1:32:54] these are simple things but it shows our
[1:32:57] maturity or our lack of maturity
[1:32:59] and you can't say i've got a great
[1:33:01] understanding of the message
[1:33:03] and be immature in your character
[1:33:07] that's not right that's not what the
[1:33:09] message came to produce
[1:33:12] we are not to be a bunch of babies with
[1:33:14] a lot of head knowledge
[1:33:17] imagine imagine a little newborn baby
[1:33:20] carrying around a steak and trying to
[1:33:21] chomp on it it doesn't make any sense
[1:33:25] go back and if you're if if you're
[1:33:26] acting like a baby then go back and
[1:33:28] drink milk
[1:33:30] and build up your way into strong meat
[1:33:35] that's what we have to do
[1:33:38] friendship is and can be destroyed by
[1:33:41] gossip
[1:33:42] i can't emphasize that enough because
[1:33:44] it's really really easy
[1:33:46] because our flesh loves to share secret
[1:33:50] news
[1:33:51] somehow it's it's wired into us but in
[1:33:54] the wrong way
[1:33:56] in the wrong way why because of the fall
[1:33:59] because of sin we still have
[1:34:01] a sin nature in this flesh and it likes
[1:34:04] to tell secrets
[1:34:06] and you know you sit sometimes and
[1:34:08] people will jokingly say
[1:34:10] oh they're over there i'm over there
[1:34:12] with the sisters gossiping
[1:34:14] why is that funny it's not funny
[1:34:19] it's not scriptural it's just it's
[1:34:22] sinful
[1:34:23] it's it's sinful like other like other
[1:34:26] sins that we look down on and hate
[1:34:29] and rightfully so but why don't we look
[1:34:32] down on gossip
[1:34:34] because it's because we do it
[1:34:37] we do it because it's easy for us to do
[1:34:40] and we have to guard against the spirit
[1:34:42] of gossip it is this evil spirit
[1:34:44] it is a it is a person it is a demon
[1:34:47] yeah
[1:34:47] there and there's many demons that are
[1:34:49] named gossip
[1:34:51] and they're working everywhere around
[1:34:52] the world
[1:34:54] to spread it and bring that satisfaction
[1:34:56] into your heart
[1:34:57] to gossip but it's not the spirit of
[1:35:00] christ
[1:35:02] it's the enemy of christ
[1:35:05] love covers hatred
[1:35:08] spreads strife think about that for a
[1:35:11] minute
[1:35:13] let your first reaction as a christian
[1:35:15] be i heard this news
[1:35:17] love covers a multitude of sins
[1:35:20] and then pray and ask what the next step
[1:35:22] is
[1:35:25] but let it be your first reaction love
[1:35:27] covers a multitude not
[1:35:29] spreading strife
[1:35:36] john 15 12 and 13.
[1:35:44] this is my commandment that you love one
[1:35:47] another as i have loved you
[1:35:50] greater love hath no man than this that
[1:35:51] a man lay down his life
[1:35:54] for his friends we are to love
[1:35:57] one another just like christ loved the
[1:35:59] church
[1:36:01] you say that's the scripture for
[1:36:02] husbands and wives absolutely
[1:36:05] you're absolutely right at the same time
[1:36:08] it's this scripture that we just read
[1:36:09] right there
[1:36:10] love one another as i have loved you we
[1:36:13] are to love
[1:36:14] each other like christ love the church
[1:36:16] in other words we're supposed to
[1:36:18] sacrifice
[1:36:19] ourselves for the blessing and building
[1:36:22] up
[1:36:23] of others we don't we don't live for
[1:36:26] ourselves we cannot live for ourselves
[1:36:28] if you live here for yourself you'll die
[1:36:32] eternal life is what living for others
[1:36:38] hebrews 3 13.
[1:36:46] but exhort one another daily
[1:36:49] exhort one another daily every day
[1:36:53] we should exhort each other while it is
[1:36:55] called today
[1:36:56] lest any of you be hardened through the
[1:36:58] deceitfulness of sin
[1:37:01] have you ever stopped to think about
[1:37:02] what that verse is saying for a second
[1:37:06] so we can be hardened by the
[1:37:08] deceitfulness of sin we're christians
[1:37:10] we're filled with the holy ghost and we
[1:37:13] can be hardened
[1:37:14] by the deceitfulness of sin
[1:37:18] what's god's antidote to that
[1:37:22] exhort one another daily amen
[1:37:26] that's impo that's pretty important
[1:37:28] right if
[1:37:30] if we can be hardened by the
[1:37:31] deceitfulness of sin
[1:37:33] then we need to do what exhort one
[1:37:36] another
[1:37:37] encourage each other build each other up
[1:37:40] send a send a thought pray for someone
[1:37:42] and let them know you're praying for
[1:37:44] them
[1:37:44] build one another up connect with each
[1:37:48] other
[1:37:49] let's look at some characteristics of
[1:37:51] true friendship
[1:37:54] put christ first in your heart and in
[1:37:57] everything
[1:38:00] opening up to opening up the secrets of
[1:38:03] each other's hearts connecting
[1:38:05] two hearts together loyalty
[1:38:09] you enter into the troubles of your
[1:38:11] friend and help them
[1:38:14] a friend listens and understands you
[1:38:17] not just at a surface level but at a
[1:38:19] deep level
[1:38:21] a real friend gives godly advice or
[1:38:24] correction pointing his friend back
[1:38:26] to the truth of god's word
[1:38:29] a true friend keeps private
[1:38:30] conversations private
[1:38:33] doesn't gossip a true friend lays down
[1:38:35] his life
[1:38:37] for his friend a true friend
[1:38:40] exhorts daily a true friend
[1:38:43] helps bear your burdens amen
[1:38:47] part of our service to christ is making
[1:38:49] and keeping friends
[1:38:52] think about that for a minute
[1:38:55] part of our service to the lord jesus
[1:38:58] christ
[1:38:59] is making some of you might have that
[1:39:02] down
[1:39:03] and keeping friends some of you might
[1:39:05] have that down it's both
[1:39:07] of those things people need a friend
[1:39:10] people are dying
[1:39:12] for a friend someone that would love
[1:39:14] them and care
[1:39:15] for them unconditionally not on
[1:39:18] conditions of
[1:39:20] you like what i like you might like
[1:39:22] something that i
[1:39:24] have no time for that shouldn't change
[1:39:26] anything
[1:39:27] we might be completely different we
[1:39:29] might be from different nations
[1:39:31] different skin color that should make no
[1:39:34] difference
[1:39:36] that makes no difference that's true
[1:39:38] friendship
[1:39:40] is part of our service to christ
[1:39:43] not again it's not in the worldly sense
[1:39:46] we do activities together we go do this
[1:39:48] we go do that
[1:39:49] we might do that that's fine but in a
[1:39:53] biblical sense as we do life together
[1:39:56] sure we do fun things together too but
[1:39:58] in a greater sense it's you because we
[1:40:00] come the
[1:40:01] burden bearers for each other
[1:40:05] lifting one another up in prayer and
[1:40:07] bringing healing
[1:40:09] and happiness and joy to one another
[1:40:12] and again that can't be hap that can't
[1:40:14] happen i've said this before
[1:40:16] and bears repeating that can't happen
[1:40:18] when i'm waiting for so and so to meet
[1:40:21] this need
[1:40:23] right when you go through this and you
[1:40:25] say oh i look no
[1:40:26] no one's a true friend to me don't look
[1:40:29] outward
[1:40:30] look on the inside are you a true friend
[1:40:33] to someone else
[1:40:35] you're not going to answer i will not
[1:40:37] answer for what caleb does
[1:40:40] i'm not going to i'm not going to answer
[1:40:41] for what brother jason does
[1:40:43] i'm going to answer for what this
[1:40:45] brother jason does
[1:40:48] right and so it isn't about so-and-so
[1:40:50] hasn't met my need so what
[1:40:53] it's nothing to do with anything yeah
[1:40:55] yeah that's literally has nothing to do
[1:40:57] with
[1:40:57] anything and if you're thinking along
[1:40:59] those lines that's the enemy
[1:41:02] the enemy wants you to look at other
[1:41:04] people well they haven't fulfilled their
[1:41:05] duty
[1:41:07] so so you are to fulfill
[1:41:11] your duty before god whether anyone does
[1:41:14] it to you
[1:41:15] or not that is the only way that there
[1:41:18] could be a true friendship
[1:41:20] otherwise it's a fake friendship if
[1:41:22] you're ju again it's 50 50 it's waiting
[1:41:24] for
[1:41:24] them to do what i want them to do and
[1:41:26] then i'll respond in kind
[1:41:28] that is not friendship that's not godly
[1:41:30] love
[1:41:33] i don't even know what it is it's just
[1:41:36] doing
[1:41:36] fun activities together that's not a
[1:41:38] friendship
[1:41:40] that's what the world calls a friendship
[1:41:41] it's not what god calls a friendship
[1:41:45] if christ if in christ he wants
[1:41:48] us to be other focused
[1:41:52] not self-focused again the thinking that
[1:41:55] says other people haven't done da da da
[1:41:57] da
[1:41:58] that's me that's me me me
[1:42:01] me it isn't about you
[1:42:04] amen it's not about your needs
[1:42:08] it christ has met your needs and your
[1:42:10] portion is to be christ
[1:42:13] psalm 63 our satisfaction
[1:42:17] completely has to be in christ then when
[1:42:20] our satisfaction is completely in christ
[1:42:22] we can be true friends
[1:42:24] outside of that it's false
[1:42:28] we are not to be self-centered we're not
[1:42:30] looking for
[1:42:31] our own pleasure that other people can
[1:42:33] afford to us
[1:42:35] there's nothing wrong with having a
[1:42:37] friend that you enjoy
[1:42:39] being around i'm not saying that but the
[1:42:41] purpose of friendship is not
[1:42:43] merely enjoying one another the purpose
[1:42:46] of friendship
[1:42:48] is christ in you reaching out to others
[1:42:53] proverbs 18 24
[1:43:05] a man that has friends must show himself
[1:43:08] friendly amen and there is a friend that
[1:43:11] sticketh closer than
[1:43:13] a brother so if you want a friend
[1:43:17] you have to be a person that is friendly
[1:43:20] to others
[1:43:22] it starts with you say i don't have any
[1:43:24] friends i don't everybody i'm close to
[1:43:27] starts with you don't wait for another
[1:43:30] person
[1:43:32] to meet your need christ is already
[1:43:34] meeting your needs
[1:43:36] look to christ and then say lord i want
[1:43:39] to be a friend to other people
[1:43:42] that's the road to satisfaction the road
[1:43:46] to satisfaction is not
[1:43:47] why i go to church or this church they
[1:43:49] just don't have any love
[1:43:50] nobody's reaching out to me okay
[1:43:55] sorry that's your experience but reach
[1:43:58] out to someone
[1:43:59] and you'll find a hand reaching out to
[1:44:00] you amen
[1:44:02] again again our purpose is not to be
[1:44:05] self-serving
[1:44:07] it's to serve others
[1:44:11] if you want friends then reach out to
[1:44:13] others and do things that are friendly
[1:44:16] i don't want to have to go into that but
[1:44:18] invite someone to your house
[1:44:20] go meet them for coffee text them to
[1:44:24] go rent a boat together to go fishing
[1:44:26] and fellowship about the lord
[1:44:31] the list goes on and on and on and on
[1:44:33] it's not complicated
[1:44:35] it's really simple stuff but it's things
[1:44:38] that we have to
[1:44:39] we we have to look inside of ourselves
[1:44:42] and say
[1:44:43] okay how can i reach out not how
[1:44:47] i'm waiting for everybody to reach out
[1:44:48] to me no i want to reach out
[1:44:50] and be a help and a blessing to others
[1:44:53] and in turn you'll find that you're the
[1:44:54] one
[1:44:55] that's the most blessed amen
[1:44:58] why because you're pouring yourself out
[1:45:00] for other people
[1:45:01] and what happens when you do that you
[1:45:03] get the blessing from god
[1:45:06] amen we have to take the initiative
[1:45:13] we have to do things that friends would
[1:45:15] do
[1:45:16] simple things visit them if there's if
[1:45:19] they're sick
[1:45:21] right now you probably can't go to the
[1:45:22] hospital and visit people
[1:45:24] unless they're your immediate family but
[1:45:29] just reach out do it it's really simple
[1:45:32] things
[1:45:33] let god into your schedule
[1:45:37] let god into your time let
[1:45:40] let god dictate those things for you so
[1:45:43] that you
[1:45:44] can be available for him to use you
[1:45:47] to be a friend to other people
[1:45:51] that's not a low-level spiritual thing
[1:45:53] to say you can be a friend
[1:45:55] to someone that's a high-level thing
[1:45:57] that's a big deal
[1:45:59] that's what sons and daughters of god do
[1:46:01] they're friends for other
[1:46:03] to other people musicians if you'd come
[1:46:08] demanding friendship is sitting alone
[1:46:10] with a frustrated look
[1:46:12] not what you're doing when you're doing
[1:46:14] that you're doing the opposite
[1:46:16] of what you want you're you're not
[1:46:19] attracting people to you
[1:46:20] you're not welcoming people to you but
[1:46:23] with your in your heart and with your
[1:46:24] expectations you're pushing them away
[1:46:29] you're holding them accountable for
[1:46:31] being friendly to you
[1:46:33] when you'll be held accountable for not
[1:46:35] being friendly
[1:46:36] to others again i've
[1:46:40] i've seen it over and over again with
[1:46:41] people they leave a church the people
[1:46:43] are not loving
[1:46:45] they didn't do this they didn't do that
[1:46:46] they didn't do that guess what
[1:46:48] every word that they're saying is
[1:46:51] pointing back right at themselves they
[1:46:54] never did
[1:46:54] any of that they were just waiting for
[1:46:57] someone else to do it
[1:46:58] what is it that's a lot of times what it
[1:47:01] is it's a person
[1:47:03] who really needs healing it's a person
[1:47:06] that's broken
[1:47:08] it's a person that's hurting and when
[1:47:10] you see those signs of
[1:47:12] crossed arms and man look and say don't
[1:47:16] say look at that ordinary guy say
[1:47:18] look at that broken individual lord
[1:47:21] help me to be the hand
[1:47:25] of healing for that person they're
[1:47:27] hurting
[1:47:29] they're struggling but don't but don't
[1:47:32] the best thing is you if you're in that
[1:47:35] condition
[1:47:36] go to go to the lord and ask him to help
[1:47:38] you and send someone
[1:47:40] that would be a means of healing he
[1:47:43] wants to use
[1:47:44] friendship as a means of healing people
[1:47:49] that's not very spiritual we want to
[1:47:50] have a prayer line
[1:47:52] [Music]
[1:47:53] okay let's have a prayer line but
[1:47:56] i'll pray that the lord will anoint you
[1:47:59] to be a real friend
[1:48:00] to bring healing supernatural healing
[1:48:04] in the lives of those who are hurting
[1:48:08] that's what friendship is very important
[1:48:11] if christ says i'm your friend what does
[1:48:14] he bring to you
[1:48:16] he brings healing salvation
[1:48:18] transformation
[1:48:20] satisfaction of heart
[1:48:23] what are you supposed to be as a friend
[1:48:25] you're supposed to be
[1:48:28] that christ in you
[1:48:31] doing that through you to others
[1:48:34] amen let's stand up and pray

[1:48:59] of christ the heart
[1:49:03] of christ to reach out to others when
[1:49:08] they're
[1:49:08] unfriendly while we were
[1:49:12] yet sinners while we were enemies of god
[1:49:16] christ reached out to us and died for us
[1:49:22] and became our closest friend
[1:49:26] in all of this lord may we have this
[1:49:29] love
