[25:57] going to send that to you right on time
[25:59] my PowerPoints usually come right when
[26:01] I'm walking out and so um the the devil
[26:06] really was fighting us just right before
[26:08] service and uh just trying to get my
[26:10] notes and prepped and then had to uh and
[26:13] I was what I'm going to be speaking on
[26:15] tonight I really felt impressed to have
[26:17] a lot of it up here on the slide so that
[26:20] you could read these things with me and
[26:22] uh right as I was just getting them
[26:24] prepared just uh the devil threw the
[26:26] kitchen sink at us and so uh but we got
[26:29] the victory amen and and those online
[26:32] can have sound and so we're thankful for
[26:33] that but it really just threw a wrench
[26:35] and uh my preparation I asked but the
[26:37] Tony could have give me just a couple
[26:39] extra minutes and so um so we just we
[26:42] believe the Lord has all things in
[26:43] control amen we're calm we're collected
[26:47] we're relaxed because we got the Lord on
[26:49] our side amen and that's the only reason
[26:51] we're here tonight amen it's because the
[26:53] Lord was on our side Joshua chapter 2
[26:56] let's just begin reading very familiar
[26:57] script scripture here and I'm just going
[26:59] to read just um one just one verse here
[27:01] from verse 12 this is Rahab now
[27:04] therefore I pray you swear unto me by
[27:07] the Lord since I have showed you
[27:09] kindness that you will also show
[27:11] kindness unto my father's house and give
[27:14] me a true token Lord Jesus we give you
[27:18] thanks for the reading of your word
[27:19] tonight believing Lord God that you
[27:22] control all things Lord God and that
[27:24] nothing's out of cater Lord nothing's
[27:27] out of step nothing's Out of Time Lord
[27:29] everything's fall into the Rhythm Of
[27:31] Your Divine Providence we believe that
[27:34] Lord with all of our heart God you've
[27:36] seen us Lord here you've seen the
[27:37] struggles that each individual Lord
[27:40] that's standing here tonight you knew
[27:42] every struggle they would go through
[27:44] Lord to to get them here in your house
[27:46] tonight Lord and father I believe that
[27:48] you've given us a word Lord that could
[27:51] come and minister to your children's
[27:53] Heart Lord may it bring encouragement
[27:55] may it bring refreshment Lord Lord if it
[27:58] if we need Revival then we just raise
[28:00] our hands and say send Revival Lord God
[28:03] I pray to every person that's here
[28:05] tonight Lord any of those that would
[28:06] listen by way of archive Lord or those
[28:09] that'll be streaming here tonight may
[28:11] you just add your blessing to it now we
[28:13] give it to you in the name of Jesus
[28:15] Christ amen you can be seated amen I'm
[28:19] going to minister to you tonight and I
[28:20] really don't uh I'm I'm just going to
[28:23] take tonight as more of a teaching
[28:25] session and uh we say that all the time
[28:28] minute doesn't really always go that way
[28:30] but we'll uh try to teach some of these
[28:32] things and so I believe teaching is
[28:34] important and so understanding some of
[28:36] these some things sometimes it's good to
[28:38] take a Wednesday night and be able just
[28:40] to cover some very basic things and uh
[28:43] one of those things that uh I believe is
[28:45] an important truth that was restored
[28:48] very vital to us in this end time in the
[28:51] age that we live in and that is the
[28:53] token
[28:55] amen amen the token would be a very
[28:58] important uh Revelation and very
[29:01] important subject and so we just have a
[29:03] lot we want to say on it tonight and I
[29:05] have some of these on the slides and
[29:06] some of them I don't and that's okay uh
[29:08] we just trust the Lord that what we did
[29:10] get up there is just fine and the Lord
[29:13] knows knows best we we have this uh
[29:17] subject of the token and I've read it
[29:19] out of Joshua chapter 2 and I'm not just
[29:22] preaching on the token preaching on the
[29:24] Supreme token and you you you that study
[29:27] the message will be familiar with that
[29:29] statement brother Brandon makes that
[29:31] we've received a supernatural Supreme
[29:33] token and so that quote I don't I have
[29:36] it at the very last slide um sister
[29:39] Esther if you could um I'll just I'll
[29:42] control it here actually I'll control it
[29:44] here so that we can just read it and
[29:45] follow it together so we know all of
[29:48] these things uh taught by the message um
[29:52] of what the true token was and and and
[29:55] Rahab we know asked this question to the
[29:58] spies and she asked for this true token
[30:01] she and they the Bible tells us how that
[30:04] they you know that God had said he would
[30:05] pass through Egypt and and that he would
[30:08] uh execute judgment and all of the
[30:10] firstborn uh would die and God says but
[30:14] the blood shall be for a token upon the
[30:17] house where you where you are when I see
[30:20] the blood I will pass over you and the
[30:22] plague shall not be upon you to destroy
[30:25] you when I smite the land of Egypt I
[30:28] love how brother Bram says this in the
[30:30] message the token and he says to the
[30:32] world it's a bunch of foolishness but to
[30:35] God it's the only way the only thing he
[30:39] requires is that token it must be there
[30:42] you cannot have the token until the fair
[30:44] is paid then you are a possessor of the
[30:48] token which gives you the privilege of a
[30:50] free pass if I see the blood I'll pass
[30:54] over you what a time what a privilege to
[30:56] know that you pack with within you the
[31:00] past what a statement when I see the
[31:03] blood I'll pass over you it's the only
[31:06] thing that he'll recognize it's nothing
[31:09] else that can take its place I brought
[31:11] something very special for y'all tonight
[31:13] and you're all going to love me a lot
[31:15] better even you people that are not
[31:17] Apple lovers will love this brother Mark
[31:19] he's not here but I got a little button
[31:21] on my Apple watch that I added and it's
[31:23] a 1eh hour timer and I'm going to click
[31:25] it right now and when it goes off I'm
[31:28] going to stop Fair
[31:31] agreement now don't now I want you to
[31:33] hold me to my
[31:35] word amen so let me just go for one hour
[31:38] amen from now and uh and so we'll just
[31:41] keep going sorry for that Interruption
[31:43] but I wanted to make sure I remembered
[31:44] that brother bham says it's the only
[31:46] thing he'll recognize it's nothing else
[31:48] that can take its place no substitute
[31:51] listen no substitute no denomination no
[31:54] nothing else it takes that God said that
[31:58] will I see so he's looking for something
[32:00] right he's looking for a token notice
[32:03] there was no substitute to it there was
[32:05] no other way there was nothing that
[32:06] would no matter how great or splendous
[32:09] uh you know uh no matter how great you
[32:11] would think it could be brother bam says
[32:14] God would take no substitute no matter
[32:16] how holy the person was on the outside
[32:19] no matter how perfect their walk was on
[32:22] the outside if they didn't have the
[32:24] token it really meant nothing amen right
[32:27] so holiness is good we thank God for
[32:30] Holiness we believe that we serve a holy
[32:32] God but let me say it this way Holiness
[32:34] won't get you in the
[32:37] Rapture talking about the outward
[32:39] Holiness the Bible says Be You adorned
[32:42] with the inward beauty of the Lord
[32:44] that's what David said it was the inward
[32:46] Holiness that really matters can you say
[32:48] Amen tonight so it had to be the token
[32:51] it was something that was visible that's
[32:53] why the Bible made it the the spies said
[32:56] it needs to be a Scarlet cord that was
[32:59] spoke of many things we could say on
[33:01] that but it represented the blood it was
[33:04] visible and it was it was something that
[33:06] was going to be a cord which the would
[33:08] the same spies would escape from it was
[33:11] we could say the means of Salvation this
[33:14] is what they gave Rahab when she said
[33:17] give me a true token so they gave her
[33:19] something that was visible come on
[33:21] somebody we're talking about we're
[33:23] talking about a true token a supreme
[33:25] token that we've received God didn't
[33:27] give us a dress code I'm thankful for a
[33:29] dress code but the dress code ain't the
[33:32] token I'm thankful for holy living I'm
[33:34] thankful for a home that I I've taken
[33:36] the trash out but listen that's not the
[33:39] token right I'm thankful for the blood
[33:42] of Christ but that's not the token the
[33:45] life that was in the blood is the token
[33:48] you can brother bam said I can have a
[33:49] vial of the literal blood of Jesus
[33:51] Christ that wouldn't do anybody any good
[33:53] but the life of the of the sacrifice
[33:57] would come back on the believer and that
[33:59] would make it the token that's what God
[34:01] was looking for so it was a means of
[34:03] Salvation you know what else I love
[34:05] about this token is it wasn't just for
[34:09] Rahab but it was for her whole
[34:11] family the token that God gives you in
[34:14] this day the Supreme token isn't just
[34:16] for you it's for your whole family a
[34:19] father can apply it a mother can apply
[34:21] it and it's for all of the children it's
[34:23] for the whole family so it was it was it
[34:26] was for the entire family when Jericho
[34:28] was destroyed Joshua said go into the
[34:31] harlot's house and bring her out and and
[34:33] and all the Bible says it this way and
[34:35] all that belong to
[34:37] her in accordance with your oath that
[34:40] you gave to her so Rahab we know this
[34:43] and I'm I I just want to spend just a
[34:45] minute on this because we got a lot to
[34:46] get to but a Rahab we know would be a
[34:49] type of a woman who was a complete alien
[34:51] she was she was from not only that she
[34:54] was a Canaanite meaning that she was
[34:56] from a cursed race she she lived from a
[34:58] cursed people she had no Heritage she
[35:00] had no lineage she didn't it didn't
[35:02] matter it didn't matter let me say it
[35:05] this way in this day it doesn't matter
[35:07] what your history is doesn't matter what
[35:09] family you came from doesn't matter what
[35:11] your past said because it was going to
[35:13] be faith that adopted her into the
[35:15] family of God and so listen Hebrews
[35:18] would list the most notable people in
[35:20] the Bible yet it puts this little woman
[35:22] Rahab the Harlot right with the heroes
[35:25] of the faith right in the midle middle
[35:27] of a bunch of renowned great Heroes like
[35:30] Abraham and and all of these great
[35:32] Heroes of Faith yet God inserts right in
[35:35] the company of this great people God
[35:38] inserts this little woman named Rahab
[35:40] who's known in the Bible back then as a
[35:43] harlot let me tell you what she's not
[35:45] known as Rahab the Harlot
[35:47] anymore Hallelujah so so you say brother
[35:50] Matt what's the point my point is is
[35:52] that God is no respector of persons we
[35:55] know that so you know what that what
[35:57] else else that means is that God doesn't
[35:59] see anything he doesn't see your last
[36:01] name he doesn't see your past he doesn't
[36:03] see where you came from he sees one
[36:05] thing Faith which is a
[36:09] revelation so she was a Canaanite this
[36:13] this by Nature meant that she was an
[36:15] alien from the Commonwealth she was from
[36:17] a cursed people a people that God said
[36:20] wipe out destroy them don't keep any of
[36:23] them so she was part of that Wild Olive
[36:25] Tree the Bible speaks of in the new test
[36:27] of that family that was grafted into the
[36:30] family of God what was it going to be it
[36:32] was going to be my
[36:34] representation it was going to be your
[36:36] representation that God could takeen
[36:38] nobody from nowhere with no name with no
[36:41] nothing of themselves that they could
[36:43] give yet God could save could take a
[36:45] seat of faith and place it inside of you
[36:47] and God would recognize that Faith oh
[36:51] friends what Grace what Amazing Grace
[36:54] she belonged to a heathen she was
[36:56] abandoned at as a harlot my goodness she
[37:00] was abandoned as a harlot listen friends
[37:03] this was her own choice I'm not
[37:05] preaching to you some woman that you
[37:07] know Misfortune and came to but this was
[37:10] her own choice it was it was it was but
[37:13] what was God doing God was singling out
[37:16] one person who was the most unworthy to
[37:19] receive Grace so that you can look at
[37:22] yourself and say I might be the most
[37:24] unworthy I might be unworthy un
[37:27] deserving but God by Grace by Amazing
[37:32] Grace oh sin did abound but how much
[37:35] more grace did abound in my testimony he
[37:38] singled her out it showed that by her
[37:40] own choice she was given up to the most
[37:44] viest life you could think of for a
[37:46] woman let me say it this way it was her
[37:48] own choice that that that made her a
[37:50] harlot but it was divine choice that
[37:53] made her a predestinated
[37:56] seed it was your human choice that
[37:59] brought you to sin but God made a Divine
[38:01] choice that overrode your choice it over
[38:05] Road your path you took in life and God
[38:07] said divine grace is going to come over
[38:09] and rewrite This Woman's life can you
[38:13] identify with that here tonight and so
[38:16] this is this was she was the most
[38:17] unlikely candidate a name that it should
[38:20] have been scrubbed out in judgment and
[38:22] destruction there was no sabbaths
[38:24] observed in Jericho there was no
[38:26] evangelist there was no preachers there
[38:28] was no there was she didn't have a
[38:30] chance there was no scripture reading
[38:31] even the Torah wasn't read in Jericho
[38:34] she didn't have a chance uh there was
[38:36] there was no Prophet sounding forth any
[38:38] message of warning uh if anybody should
[38:41] have never made it oh I could say if
[38:44] anybody should have never made it how
[38:46] many can say that with me if anybody
[38:48] never had a chance I didn't have a
[38:50] chance if anybody wasn't going to make
[38:53] it it would have been a would have been
[38:54] little sister
[38:56] Rahab
[38:58] amen how did the spies even think of how
[39:00] the spies even just so happened they
[39:02] came into this woman's
[39:04] house out of all the people in Jericho
[39:07] they came to one little woman you say
[39:10] why brother Matt because there was a
[39:11] predestinated seed before she ever made
[39:14] her first wrong choice God already made
[39:16] a Divine
[39:17] Choice oh
[39:20] Hallelujah even even these men how they
[39:22] located this woman will you brother Bron
[39:25] preaches a message one in a million so
[39:27] God literally LED these women to her
[39:29] house she couldn't get to God so God
[39:32] came to her the Bible says it this way
[39:34] the Lord knoweth them that are
[39:37] his Hallelujah and so so the Bible gives
[39:41] this you know this entire uh story here
[39:43] of Rahab and we just want to pause from
[39:45] that just for a moment I just want to
[39:47] bring a point that it was rahab's faith
[39:50] in the god that she heard about that
[39:53] saved her I said it was rahab's faith in
[39:57] a God she was told
[40:01] about another words she was of the kind
[40:05] or the type of person that didn't need a
[40:07] scientific explanation she didn't need
[40:10] some indoctrination she didn't need some
[40:12] human intellectual reasoning to
[40:14] rationalize it out but she heard about a
[40:17] living God and she believed in that
[40:19] Living God whom she heard about never
[40:22] had seen Jesus said blessed are you that
[40:24] have not seen and yet still believe
[40:27] friends do you realize tonight you have
[40:29] a seed gen of God down inside of you
[40:32] because you believe in a God that you've
[40:34] heard
[40:35] about Hallelujah that was the difference
[40:39] between Rahab and everyone else she
[40:41] wasn't where she should have been in
[40:43] life she wasn't doing what she should
[40:44] have been in life she was doing
[40:46] everything but searching for the Lord
[40:50] amen yet the Bible says she heard about
[40:53] a God and believed in that God so God
[40:56] gives her a token it's an identification
[40:59] it's something for I want to get these
[41:02] principles to you I know they're very
[41:03] simple but the token is something for
[41:07] you to
[41:09] see and something for God to
[41:13] see I said the token that God gives you
[41:17] is something for you to see and it was
[41:20] something for God to
[41:22] see so when God gives us the Holy Ghost
[41:26] it's something that God sees and death
[41:29] passes over and it's something we see as
[41:32] a transformation that comes to our
[41:35] heart it's work the Bible says that
[41:38] works is Faith expressed it's something
[41:41] for God to see listen brother bam says
[41:43] this is the evening time the age that we
[41:45] live in this is the evening time for the
[41:48] church this is the evening time this is
[41:50] the token in 1963 brother Brandon
[41:53] preaches this is the evening time for my
[41:56] Ministry this this is the evening time
[41:58] for my message I'm dying I'm going I'm
[42:01] moving out in the evening brother random
[42:03] says I'm dying I'm going I'm moving out
[42:05] in the evening time of the gospel and
[42:08] we've come through
[42:10] justification through sanctification and
[42:13] so forth but this is the time that the
[42:17] token has to be applied amen oh friends
[42:22] that that just feels like lightning
[42:23] bolts going through my body this is the
[42:26] time
[42:28] that the token must be
[42:32] applied this is the hour where the token
[42:37] must be on
[42:39] display you say brother Matt what is the
[42:41] token it is the literal Life of Christ
[42:46] it is the personal revelation to you
[42:48] Christ to you
[42:50] personally it is the Dynamics coming
[42:53] upon the
[42:54] mechanics it is come on somebody help me
[42:56] preach
[42:57] it is the wheat
[43:00] seed it is the Omega that was the alpha
[43:04] it is the baptism it is not a baptism it
[43:06] is not a gift of the Holy Ghost the
[43:09] token is the person of Christ himself
[43:13] and let me with that being said let me
[43:15] say this he must be on
[43:18] display brother bam says it must be
[43:21] applied I told you last Sunday i'
[43:22] something I want to talk to you about
[43:24] this is it the time that when you you
[43:27] can't just play with it it's got to be
[43:30] done if it's ever going to be done it's
[43:34] got to be done
[43:37] now we can see the Wrath is just about
[43:40] to ready to pass over this country we
[43:42] can see God's Wrath is just ready to the
[43:45] the cup is overflowing friends I don't
[43:47] know of an age ever lived in before
[43:49] where we could say it more true today
[43:51] that we're living at the coming of the
[43:53] Lord
[43:55] Jesus we're living right on the cusp of
[43:57] his wrath ready to be poured out we see
[44:00] it in the signs we see it in signs in
[44:02] the heaven we see signs on the earth we
[44:03] see signs of wars and rumors of War I
[44:06] I'm not preaching on that here tonight
[44:08] but if you ever were living with time
[44:10] fulfilling prophecy modern events being
[44:13] made clear by prophecy it's right now
[44:16] friend and let me say this the token
[44:18] must be on display he's looking for the
[44:21] literal life of Jesus Christ the literal
[44:26] life of Jesus Jesus Christ what part of
[44:28] him all of
[44:30] him which Doctrine all of his Doctrine
[44:33] which part of his character all of his
[44:36] character which part your brother
[44:38] Brandon brother Brandon would say oh if
[44:39] that if that church could only become a
[44:42] reflector of that first church I say God
[44:45] let me be a reflector of that first
[44:47] church let my testimony reflect the book
[44:50] of Acts church if there was ever an age
[44:53] where God's looking for the token to be
[44:56] on display at right now in our
[44:58] life I'm getting ahead of myself but I
[45:01] just I just want to pause so didn't you
[45:02] say brother Matt what is that Supreme
[45:04] token brother B says as the evening
[45:06] Shadows are appearing and the Wrath is
[45:09] ready to be poured out from on high from
[45:10] upon these ungodly Nations and upon
[45:12] ungodly unbelievers upon the professors
[45:16] without a
[45:20] possession upon these I've tried to
[45:22] unfold myself and live right among it to
[45:25] see where it was standing before I said
[45:26] these things we're living in the shadows
[45:28] and the Wrath is ready to strike and God
[45:31] is requiring a token that you yourself
[45:35] have received his token the Holy Ghost
[45:39] it's the only way and the only sign that
[45:44] God will ever pass because it is the
[45:47] literal life of Jesus Christ returned
[45:51] back into the believer therefore in the
[45:55] days of Luther and the days of Wesley in
[45:57] the days of Luther you had the water age
[46:00] in the days of Wesley you had the blood
[46:02] age brother bandam says but in this day
[46:06] now what is it going to be it's going to
[46:08] be not the water not the blood not not
[46:10] the gifts of the Spirit but actually the
[46:13] person himself the life of the Lamb
[46:16] comes back on the worshipper oh brother
[46:19] Brandon would say in the identified
[46:20] Masterpiece don't you know Abel died
[46:23] upon the same rock that his lamb was
[46:26] slain upon
[46:28] think about that friends Abel died on
[46:30] the same Rock he slay his lamb upon what
[46:33] was it representing to be identified
[46:35] with your sacrifice to be identified
[46:38] with Jesus Christ is to be identified
[46:41] with his death his barrel and his
[46:43] resurrection as Paul says that I may
[46:45] know him in the power of his
[46:47] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[46:52] suffering it's incredible to me how
[46:54] focused and I'm just hope I can say
[46:56] these things carefully enough to not uh
[46:59] say them wrong in in a way that would
[47:01] would cause a
[47:03] misunderstanding but but let me just say
[47:05] this it's amazing how how self-obsessed
[47:08] of a world we live in that is so
[47:11] self-obsessed with personal
[47:15] suffering can I just preach to you here
[47:17] just for a moment Paul says I reckon
[47:19] that the sufferings of this present time
[47:21] are not worthy to be compared with the
[47:23] glory that's Romans
[47:25] 8:18 with the which shall be re revealed
[47:28] in us so so so this this is this is so
[47:32] opposite of the world that you live in a
[47:35] world that is so enamored and and and
[47:38] and as I said so taken in with inward
[47:42] inward everything's about you
[47:44] everything's about me everything's about
[47:45] what I've went through what I've
[47:46] suffered all the bruises I have all the
[47:48] things and all the troubles in my life
[47:51] don't you realize that's a spirit that
[47:53] was prophesied upon this generation that
[47:56] men would become lovers of their own
[47:58] self do you know that you can be a lover
[48:00] of your own self when you take a pity
[48:02] party about all the things that you've
[48:04] went through and all of the people
[48:05] that's treated you wrong and all the
[48:07] people that's offended you and all the
[48:09] people and that you say brother Matt
[48:10] well they really did I have no doubt
[48:12] they really did but listen friends God
[48:14] never asked you to be in the fellowship
[48:16] of your own sufferings he asked you to
[48:18] be in the fellowship of his
[48:20] sufferings and we live in a world that
[48:22] is self so so so intoxicated with self
[48:26] hope I could say that correctly spending
[48:29] so much spiritual energy on pain and
[48:32] hurts listen I I I believe in pain pain
[48:36] we preached on it broken but not bitter
[48:37] I pre I preached that here and I believe
[48:39] in 100% God wants to use the bruise that
[48:42] came in your life but if we're not
[48:44] careful friends we can become so self
[48:47] indulged in our own
[48:51] suffering that we forget this life isn't
[48:53] about our life and about all that we
[48:55] went through Paul said that I may know
[48:58] him in the fellowship of his sufferings
[49:00] Paul went through as much that just
[49:02] Jesus did as a human outside of the
[49:05] suffering you could even say is the
[49:07] beheading there there would be very few
[49:09] things that Paul didn't go through was
[49:10] Shipwrecked and beaten and
[49:13] stoned but but he never he never was he
[49:16] never
[49:17] boasted he it was never about Paul it
[49:20] was never about what he went through do
[49:23] you realize how quickly we can make our
[49:25] Christian Life about what what we've
[49:27] went
[49:31] through I know that's so backwards from
[49:34] maybe I hope I hope you don't
[49:35] misunderstand me I hope you know my
[49:38] heart but we can become so focused even
[49:42] the modern church today you read their
[49:44] books and books and books and books that
[49:47] have been New York Times bestsellers
[49:49] from Christian authors talking about
[49:51] hurt and pain and how other people hurt
[49:53] you and how to overcome the pains and
[49:55] hurts that you've received in your life
[49:56] life and I believe in all of that but do
[50:00] you realize friends if you're not
[50:01] careful you take that and you take a
[50:03] spirit of
[50:05] self-love when it was never God God is
[50:08] not at God is not here to put Band-Aids
[50:10] on everything that you've ever went
[50:11] through and just me this life is not
[50:13] about a perfect life and a perfect Eden
[50:15] with no pain and no hurt and no
[50:18] trouble hello
[50:21] somebody there's n numerous with so much
[50:24] compassion upon about the hurt of the of
[50:27] the suffering of humanity and I believe
[50:30] in all of it but if we're not careful we
[50:32] enter into the fellowship of our
[50:34] brother's
[50:36] suffering and we never enter into the
[50:38] fellowship of Christ
[50:40] suffering if you want to reign with him
[50:43] you've got to suffer with
[50:45] him brother brandham says he clearly
[50:48] shows that those who will reign with him
[50:49] must come the same way he came amen you
[50:53] think Jesus didn't have a right to be
[50:55] offended
[51:00] it's true when one member suffers the
[51:01] whole body suffers I believe in that I
[51:03] see nothing wrong with people uh G
[51:05] getting help for some of the things
[51:07] they've went through and things that
[51:08] their burdens that they've went in their
[51:09] life I believe in every single bit of
[51:11] that I believe it's scriptural I believe
[51:13] in that I you know I 100% but the
[51:17] problem is is that if we're not careful
[51:19] we become so selfishly and self
[51:25] centered
[51:27] and people can become so self-consumed
[51:29] by their own hurts you said booy brother
[51:31] Matt you took a
[51:35] turn we can become so self self-
[51:39] centered about the about our own pain
[51:41] and our own suffering that it's left us
[51:44] with little or no time to contemplate
[51:48] what Paul meant when he said that I may
[51:50] know him in the fellowship of his
[51:55] suffering
[51:59] hello notice this today and I I'm just
[52:01] going to pause from that maybe we'll
[52:03] preach on that some other
[52:06] time but uh but but we are preaching on
[52:08] that we're preaching on the Supreme
[52:09] token and what it means to be identified
[52:11] with your
[52:14] lamb let me let me just inject that here
[52:17] that do you know that the the things
[52:20] when you can go through your pain and
[52:22] your suffering and your torment and give
[52:25] Glory unto God and not make it make you
[52:27] bitter and and angry and callous do you
[52:30] know what you're doing you're being
[52:32] identified with your
[52:35] lamb who had a right to get angry but he
[52:37] opened not his
[52:39] mouth hello as we said it the L when we
[52:43] preach that message you you you say they
[52:45] hurt me they offended me and now's my
[52:47] chance to get back and get revenge no
[52:49] now's your chance to exercise true
[52:55] power
[52:57] amen so so what is this supreme token
[53:01] what is this
[53:02] token this supreme token careful
[53:06] now I'm I'm I'm really going to get
[53:08] myself into a
[53:10] pickle what is this supreme token
[53:12] brother Brandon would say this and I'm
[53:13] just going to fast forward down to the
[53:15] to the very last two slides here uh
[53:18] you're going to have to put that back up
[53:19] I went one too many my apologies but I
[53:21] wanted to get to the very last one let
[53:23] me just bring it down uh to these I want
[53:25] to read I actually got these a little
[53:27] bit out of order and that's okay I think
[53:30] this is it there yes now we have this is
[53:32] the token 1963 this is November
[53:34] different than the one we read from
[53:36] September but he says now we have a
[53:38] token in this day how many believe that
[53:41] we've been given a token which is an
[53:44] anti-type of that type make sure I
[53:46] didn't go uh I just lost it don't know
[53:49] what happened there you can click on the
[53:51] slide again yeah he says which is an
[53:54] anti-type of that type of that natural
[53:57] token we've been given the supernatural
[54:00] Supreme token how many loves that as
[54:03] much as I do all that foreshadowed had
[54:06] been given I love that all that that
[54:09] foreshadowed has been given to this
[54:12] generation has been given the token now
[54:14] we have the Holy Ghost is our token it
[54:18] is our
[54:20] identification that we have accepted the
[54:23] death of the Lamb Not only was Jesus
[54:26] just a human life to come back on us but
[54:30] it was God himself manifested in flesh
[54:33] that brought back upon us the adoption
[54:35] of sons that now we are Sons and
[54:39] Daughters of God that is the token it's
[54:44] our identification of the Passover it's
[54:47] our in identification that we have
[54:49] believed God and God has
[54:53] accepted so you notice brother Adam uses
[54:56] this word here that brought back God
[54:58] himself manifest manifested in flesh
[55:00] that brought back upon us the adoption
[55:02] of sons okay now let me start at the
[55:04] beginning I want to take you through
[55:06] some of these things that brother
[55:07] brandham mentions and we're just going
[55:09] to go through these uh uh as we feel L I
[55:12] may read from some more that I don't
[55:14] have up there and so uh but that's okay
[55:17] we just want to we want to just get to
[55:19] what the Lord wants us to and then we'll
[55:21] we'll close um and I've lost it here
[55:24] before me but that's okay so so brother
[55:27] bam says this uh in in the message
[55:30] leadership give me just one moment while
[55:32] I pull this up I'm gonna I'm going to
[55:34] need this okay thank you Lord so so
[55:37] there's a difference brother Brandon
[55:38] would make a a a a differentiation if I
[55:42] could say it that way he would
[55:43] differentiate some of these terms let me
[55:46] pull that back here just for a moment
[55:48] from where you go from him talking about
[55:50] the Supreme token or the supernatural
[55:53] token so I'm just going to take a a just
[55:55] a corner here just make make a turn
[55:58] maybe pull it down in gear from fifth
[55:59] gear just go a little bit slower because
[56:02] you're you're going to see some things
[56:04] that the prophet says here when he's
[56:06] preaching on this subject of adoption
[56:08] which is what we just read from when
[56:10] brother bam talks about adoption the
[56:12] adoption of sons and we know that this
[56:16] this phrase brother brandham could use
[56:18] could is one that could very easily be
[56:21] misunderstood let me just say something
[56:23] friends as I just begin here uh to speak
[56:26] about this you know this is just
[56:29] something that's so real to me the Lord
[56:31] has just made so real to me personally
[56:33] and and I don't just for not even for
[56:35] one minute say that I I understand
[56:37] everything in the message I don't
[56:38] there's a lot of things that I've got if
[56:40] you've seen my Google Docs uh Drive
[56:43] you'd see so so so many documents that
[56:45] I've put in there as questions for
[56:47] myself to study because there's so much
[56:48] that we don't understand there that me
[56:51] myself I don't have all the answers uh
[56:53] all the all of the the the the things
[56:55] figured out but let me say it this way I
[56:57] can only preach to you what God has
[56:58] revealed to me and youd only want me to
[57:01] preach what God has revealed to me but
[57:03] but let me just say if I say something
[57:05] and hear and especially to someone who
[57:07] would hear this you know I'm not I'm not
[57:09] dog I'm not going to be dogmatic about
[57:12] this and and and and just put a period
[57:14] here I'll put a comma if maybe you
[57:16] didn't don't see it this way then that's
[57:18] okay the Lord can help us both I just
[57:20] want to preach it as the Lord's given it
[57:22] to me and revealed to me and and so some
[57:25] of these things you may misund you may
[57:27] would misunderstand but I just I want to
[57:29] be clear on them because I look at the
[57:32] subject a as such a vital one to
[57:36] understand and that is the subject of
[57:37] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[57:40] the true adoption of sons as being
[57:45] absolutely vital for every young person
[57:47] in our church every old person in our
[57:49] church and everybody in the middle to
[57:51] understand fully what it means to be an
[57:53] adopted son and there's so many things
[57:56] the messages I've I've even looked at
[57:58] for years now and the Lord even just
[58:00] just here recently Lord has just been
[58:02] opening things up by by Sovereign Grace
[58:05] I I believe the everybody could testify
[58:07] of that tonight the Lord shows you
[58:08] things that you didn't see before so
[58:11] thank I'm thankful for that and as
[58:13] brother randam says we should Above All
[58:14] Else pray for
[58:16] Revelation and so so but I I want to
[58:19] take from some of these things that
[58:21] brother bandham talks about when he
[58:23] talks about the adoption and the baptism
[58:26] of the Holy Ghost we're going to read
[58:28] from a quote in a minute where it talks
[58:29] about
[58:30] terminologies because you have to
[58:33] understand that the message the Bible
[58:36] became a brand new book to brother
[58:38] brandham at the opening of the seals how
[58:41] many know that here the Bible became a
[58:44] brand new book to brother brandham even
[58:46] some of the things that he said very
[58:48] early on became a became something that
[58:51] was brand new uh to brother bamman if
[58:53] you don't follow uh his
[58:56] terminology and the qualifications he
[58:59] makes of that terminology it's very very
[59:03] easy you could almost come away from
[59:05] certain things from the message as that
[59:07] brother Brandon was teaching that the
[59:09] adoption is a fourth stage or fourth
[59:13] work of Grace yet we know throughout the
[59:16] entire message how many how many
[59:18] believers do we have here brother
[59:19] Brandon preached on
[59:21] justification
[59:23] sanctification and the baptism of the
[59:25] Holy Ghost and he preached those three
[59:28] works of Grace as the three works of
[59:30] Grace are all a work of the Holy
[59:34] Ghost Holy Ghost justifies Holy Ghost
[59:37] sanctifies the Holy Ghost also speaks in
[59:39] tongues and does many gifts but that's
[59:41] not the whole that's not the person
[59:44] that's his gift brother bandam says but
[59:45] when you receive him you don't just
[59:48] receive my ink pen and you say that's
[59:50] brother Matt's inkpen all you've done is
[59:52] receive my gift but when you receive
[59:55] Christ as the true Holy Ghost when
[59:57] you're really born again you're
[59:59] receiving not his gift you're receiving
[1:00:03] him so brother Baron would preach on
[1:00:06] three steps of Grace Three works of
[1:00:08] Grace in your life and he backed that up
[1:00:10] biblically he also preached on four
[1:00:14] stages of
[1:00:18] restoration four steps of restoration he
[1:00:21] took the scripture out of Joel too and
[1:00:23] showed how that just as for death
[1:00:25] Messengers ate the life out of the
[1:00:27] church you had it in the old church you
[1:00:29] had it in the Dark Ages you had it
[1:00:31] through the Reformation right God was
[1:00:33] going to restore it back in four stages
[1:00:36] and God was going to brother BR would
[1:00:38] take justifica go go brother BR was
[1:00:40] going to take Joel chapter 2 the all
[1:00:42] that the locer all that the Locust all
[1:00:43] that the pomor all the cankerworm all
[1:00:45] the caterpillars e my great Army will I
[1:00:47] restore back unto you so he taught three
[1:00:50] steps of Grace but four works of
[1:00:53] restoration back to the church
[1:00:56] right that through that four stage that
[1:00:59] four that four stages of restoration and
[1:01:02] he typed it with a wheat plant and he
[1:01:04] typed how that the first seed that went
[1:01:06] into the ground right was was at the day
[1:01:10] was was the first The Original Seed was
[1:01:12] at that when pentec the Pentecostal
[1:01:14] church that Alpha Church The Acts 2
[1:01:17] church was the original church he would
[1:01:19] say in the Ephesian Church age what they
[1:01:22] had at Pentecost is her inalab right
[1:01:26] right you know these quotes very well
[1:01:28] Pentecost is the standard there is no
[1:01:30] other standard that is the pattern there
[1:01:32] is no other pattern what the church had
[1:01:35] in the book of
[1:01:37] Acts but then you take that word
[1:01:39] Pentecost and you take Pentecostal
[1:01:41] denomination and then people get
[1:01:43] struggle between the
[1:01:45] two because we're not talking about a
[1:01:47] Pentecostal organization or denomination
[1:01:50] we're talking about Pentecostal
[1:01:52] experience brother brand I would say
[1:01:54] that Pentecost is not denomination it's
[1:01:56] an experience right and so if you don't
[1:01:59] follow his terminology it's very easy to
[1:02:01] come away thinking that as there was
[1:02:03] four stages of
[1:02:05] restoration through through through
[1:02:07] Luther through Wesley and then brother
[1:02:10] bham did use the isusa street 1906
[1:02:13] Pentecost as a stage of restoration that
[1:02:17] God is restoring back to the church the
[1:02:19] life messenger it was part of the
[1:02:22] restoration
[1:02:23] right and he would use that uh Pentecost
[1:02:26] he says but notice but that that even
[1:02:29] though it was part of the framework even
[1:02:31] though it was part of the restoration it
[1:02:34] wasn't truly a return back to the seed
[1:02:38] right it was actually the
[1:02:42] Shu now for those young people that
[1:02:44] would hear that word and go what are
[1:02:46] they talking about Let me give it to you
[1:02:48] and make it very simple brother bham
[1:02:50] would use the wheat plant and he would
[1:02:53] take that plant to tight that just in a
[1:02:55] weat swe plant how you have a stalk you
[1:02:57] have a seed that goes in ground you have
[1:02:58] a stalk you have a tossle a blade a
[1:03:01] sprout that would come then you'd have a
[1:03:02] shook then in that Shu when you'd pull
[1:03:04] it back like a corn a you know a a a a a
[1:03:07] a thing of corn you'd pull that Shu back
[1:03:09] you'd have the seed and when you have
[1:03:11] the seed now it's returned back to the
[1:03:14] original seed that went in the
[1:03:16] ground and is this clear can we make it
[1:03:19] any clearer and so brother random would
[1:03:21] say what happened in the book of Acts go
[1:03:23] open your Bible to Acts chapter 2 notice
[1:03:25] this how God first poured out his Spirit
[1:03:28] he all that was in Christ all that was
[1:03:30] in God he poured into Christ all that
[1:03:31] was in Christ he poured back into the
[1:03:33] church and he fulfilled Joel too that's
[1:03:36] why Peter said this is that which was
[1:03:38] prophesied by Joel saying in the last
[1:03:40] days I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[1:03:42] Flesh your sons and daughters shall
[1:03:44] prophesy your old men will dream dreams
[1:03:45] your young men will see Visions right
[1:03:47] and so it was a fulfillment what was he
[1:03:49] what was he showing that what God did in
[1:03:52] the book of Acts Church in the beginning
[1:03:54] under the first Church age messenger god
[1:03:57] was pouring back the Pure
[1:04:00] Life and for a season they walked with
[1:04:03] the full abstract right they walked with
[1:04:07] the real baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:09] listen friends the thing that you
[1:04:11] receive when you receive the baptism of
[1:04:14] the Holy Ghost ain't no different than
[1:04:16] what they received on the day of
[1:04:18] Pentecost what you receive when you
[1:04:21] receive the Holy Ghost ain't no
[1:04:23] different than what Peter received when
[1:04:25] he came out of The Upper Room when they
[1:04:27] came out of the upper room speaking in
[1:04:28] other tongues listen friends if we ain't
[1:04:30] got that we've missed everything we've
[1:04:33] got to have what they had not what a
[1:04:35] church had not what a denomination had
[1:04:37] not what grandpa had not what a
[1:04:39] generation I'm not looking to go back a
[1:04:41] 100 years I'm looking to go back all the
[1:04:44] way to Acts chapter
[1:04:47] 2 and so when you receive the real life
[1:04:50] of Christ you're receiving the same
[1:04:51] thing they received right amen but then
[1:04:54] we know that that seed what that first
[1:04:57] church the Ephesian Church would
[1:04:59] eventually fall away you have the Bible
[1:05:01] ending with the book of Jude and Jude
[1:05:03] saying earnestly contend for the faith
[1:05:05] that was once delivered unto the Saints
[1:05:07] and so men have crept in unaware spots
[1:05:09] there are in your Feast of Charity when
[1:05:11] they Feast with you feated themselves
[1:05:12] without fear clouds without water uh who
[1:05:14] men of old who were for ordained of this
[1:05:16] condemnation what was it it was that
[1:05:18] Antichrist Spirit brother brandham said
[1:05:20] the True Vine and the false Vine growing
[1:05:24] together and the you go back through
[1:05:26] that down through that then you go into
[1:05:28] the Dark Ages then you go through the
[1:05:29] age of the reformation and brother bham
[1:05:32] says whenever the spirit would come in
[1:05:33] like a flood God would raise up a
[1:05:35] standard to fight against it so when he
[1:05:37] when he rose up a spear uh he he gave a
[1:05:40] lion an ox an eagle and a man
[1:05:43] anointing and so when they would come
[1:05:45] with a do with a spirit God would raise
[1:05:47] up a standard to fight against that
[1:05:48] spirit and to be born to be born again
[1:05:52] for Luther was different than what it
[1:05:54] meant to be born again for you
[1:05:57] you because a man could only live up to
[1:06:01] the full potential of the word that was
[1:06:04] given to them
[1:06:06] hello and so to be born again was to
[1:06:09] live to the fullness of the word that
[1:06:11] was revealed well only so much of Christ
[1:06:13] was given back to Luther that's why men
[1:06:16] like men like the in the Reformation age
[1:06:18] could believe in a trinity and God would
[1:06:20] weak at that but he won't weak at it for
[1:06:23] you now he now the Bible says now He
[1:06:25] commands all that all men must repent
[1:06:28] repent of what not just your sins all of
[1:06:30] your
[1:06:32] thinking right and so God was going to
[1:06:35] restore that back but isua now you have
[1:06:38] to watch and I'm just going to take take
[1:06:40] just a second to say this you have to
[1:06:42] watch because now you have a prophet
[1:06:43] Messenger on the scene you have the
[1:06:46] Elijah Ministry on the scene that's
[1:06:48] going to have a message that would turn
[1:06:50] the hearts of the children you me back
[1:06:52] to the original Apostolic Faith and he's
[1:06:55] there at the same exact time even under
[1:06:58] those Assemblies of God's Min Ministries
[1:07:01] he's under there under the same time
[1:07:04] after the isua street Pentecost after
[1:07:06] the the Holy Ghost falls on isua street
[1:07:10] there's a prophet Messenger on the scene
[1:07:12] amen and brother Barham would say that
[1:07:15] what they thought was the restoration of
[1:07:18] the book of Acts Church could not have
[1:07:21] been why because the prophet messenger
[1:07:25] hadn't even even came on the scene yet
[1:07:27] and he hadn't given the former Reign
[1:07:30] which was the teaching reain which was
[1:07:33] the message of the hour when you reject
[1:07:36] the message you're rejecting the
[1:07:37] teaching ring you're rejecting the
[1:07:39] former rain you ain't never going to get
[1:07:40] the latter rain if you don't take the
[1:07:42] former
[1:07:43] rain you can pray and pray and pray and
[1:07:45] fast and fast and Fast and live holy
[1:07:47] holy holy but if you don't have the
[1:07:49] former rain you'll never get it you'll
[1:07:51] get a harvest of what you put in the
[1:07:53] ground I tell you what friends you put
[1:07:55] this faith in this message in the ground
[1:07:57] you'll get a
[1:07:59] Rapture when the Harvest when the when
[1:08:01] the lad ring comes and that's what's
[1:08:03] falling now but when the latter rain
[1:08:05] truly comes it's not that rain comes
[1:08:07] back to the seed and it doesn't come to
[1:08:09] send us into seven more ages it comes to
[1:08:12] take the
[1:08:13] grain oh brother R said we're going in
[1:08:16] an elevator to the sky it's the Harvest
[1:08:19] rain it's the Rapture rain it's the
[1:08:23] fullness of adoption you say what is the
[1:08:26] fullness of an adopted son when your
[1:08:28] body gets what your soul already has my
[1:08:31] soul's already been translated but one
[1:08:33] day this body is going to put on what my
[1:08:36] soul already has inside
[1:08:37] [Applause]
[1:08:39] of Hallelujah you say brother Matt what
[1:08:41] are you doing now now God's honing
[1:08:44] me now you say brother Matt do you
[1:08:46] believe there's a process of adoption I
[1:08:48] believe that's what I'm going through
[1:08:49] right
[1:08:50] now but I've got the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:53] Ghost and I'm an adopted son then why
[1:08:55] would you you say you're in a process
[1:08:56] because this old flesh is still painful
[1:08:58] still gets headaches still gets
[1:09:00] backaches still gets angry sometimes mad
[1:09:04] upset temper come on Friends what's God
[1:09:07] doing what's the work of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:09] doing in my life I'm not looking to be
[1:09:11] justified I'm already Justified as
[1:09:12] though I never done it in the first
[1:09:13] place I'm not looking to be Sanctified
[1:09:15] I've already set aside for service I'm
[1:09:17] not looking to be filled with the Holy
[1:09:19] Ghost I've already received it I'm not
[1:09:21] looking to get my adoption where my name
[1:09:23] is is you know where my name brother Ram
[1:09:25] says when you're born of the spirit your
[1:09:27] name is as good on the check as
[1:09:30] his you say brother matth then what are
[1:09:32] you looking for
[1:09:33] more what else
[1:09:35] more come on does anybody feel that way
[1:09:38] I'm looking for more of Christ less of
[1:09:41] me more of him brother brandom says when
[1:09:44] that headstone comes down to the body
[1:09:46] you can't even fit but just a razor
[1:09:48] blade through there because that Holy
[1:09:50] Ghost is honing
[1:09:53] out Hallelujah I say hone me down lord
[1:09:56] Jesus and so so so if you f don't follow
[1:10:00] it closely you'd think that adoption
[1:10:02] even brother bram's adoption series that
[1:10:04] he takes you'd say brother Matt well
[1:10:05] then there must be some adoption some
[1:10:07] fourth step that we need to get to there
[1:10:09] is and it's called a body
[1:10:13] change but let me say this once a person
[1:10:16] has been sealed by the Holy
[1:10:20] Ghost once a person has been sealed by
[1:10:24] the Holy Ghost ghost they are then and
[1:10:27] only then born
[1:10:34] again yet even after this somehow some
[1:10:37] have believed that after they're born
[1:10:39] again somehow that you know there's got
[1:10:40] to be some you know for thing to give me
[1:10:43] power to give me Authority listen
[1:10:45] friends you have all power and authority
[1:10:48] of Heaven backing up your testimony that
[1:10:51] the brother bandam says that when the
[1:10:53] you put the word of God on the mouths of
[1:10:54] believers it'll never
[1:10:57] fail
[1:10:59] right and so they so so let me just move
[1:11:02] on through some of this and so I believe
[1:11:04] to rightly divide the word it's crucial
[1:11:07] that you must follow brother brenham's
[1:11:10] progression of both the
[1:11:12] terminology and the understanding of
[1:11:15] these terms you can write them down if
[1:11:16] you want to Born
[1:11:18] Again New Birth and the baptism of the
[1:11:22] Holy
[1:11:23] Ghost cuz if you don't follow follow it
[1:11:25] closely you'll get the three brother
[1:11:27] brandham interchanges them to me as if
[1:11:30] they stand in opposition of each other
[1:11:32] when actually they're the very same
[1:11:35] thing as brother brenham's early early
[1:11:38] on in his ministry if you study the
[1:11:41] message early on in his ministry he's
[1:11:44] still viewing the Bible from a church
[1:11:48] view notice I said a church view I no
[1:11:51] longer call you church I call you bride
[1:11:53] what was he saying come out of those
[1:11:54] systems
[1:11:56] come out of those
[1:11:58] systems brother Ram is still viewing the
[1:12:01] Bible when you read some of the message
[1:12:03] he's still viewing the Bible from
[1:12:05] whether it's a Baptist fundamentalist
[1:12:07] View and he hears men like Charles
[1:12:09] Fuller on the radio and he takes some of
[1:12:11] those things and you'll find brother
[1:12:12] bandam saying some of those things or or
[1:12:14] he can be influenced by the Assemblies
[1:12:16] of God Pentecostal UPC people even
[1:12:19] taking things from those men who he
[1:12:20] hears on the radio and preaching them
[1:12:22] with that with those things he teaches
[1:12:25] that the white horse rider is
[1:12:28] Christ now friends I'm not here not for
[1:12:31] one second am I here to disparage God's
[1:12:34] Prophet now for one second am I here to
[1:12:36] to to try to cast some doubt I'm not
[1:12:38] preaching to that I'm not in any way
[1:12:40] disparaging my if anything I'm doing I'm
[1:12:42] personifying the Lord Jesus in
[1:12:45] him and so so it wasn't it's not to disp
[1:12:48] him I'm just going to I think it's
[1:12:50] important to understand this to rightly
[1:12:52] divide because I've had people ask me
[1:12:54] and say M why did brother bandam say
[1:12:56] that you can be listen listen to what he
[1:12:58] says he says the Cocker many of you
[1:13:00] think I got the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:02] Ghost I'm going to heaven now hold on
[1:13:04] brother Matt you just said the baptism
[1:13:05] of the Holy Ghost is the new birth it's
[1:13:07] the cealing of the Holy Ghost you could
[1:13:09] no more be lost than God could be
[1:13:11] lost
[1:13:14] right many of you think I got the
[1:13:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to
[1:13:17] heaven that don't mean one thing you're
[1:13:19] going to
[1:13:20] heaven no sir you can have the baptism
[1:13:24] of the Holy Ghost every hour in your
[1:13:25] life and still be lost and go to
[1:13:28] hell now I had a brother read this and
[1:13:30] he was a young brother very sincere and
[1:13:32] said I don't understand this so you see
[1:13:34] how important it is to understand these
[1:13:36] things the Bible says so uhhuh that's
[1:13:38] exactly right that's leadership 1965
[1:13:39] know that not and now the reason that
[1:13:41] people today now don't don't forget this
[1:13:43] you you'll see what's you he says you'll
[1:13:45] see what the holy what the initial
[1:13:46] evidence of the Holy Ghost is now people
[1:13:48] can live in the spirit they dance in the
[1:13:50] spirit they shout in the spirit they go
[1:13:51] to church in the spirit they can
[1:13:53] absolutely have the real spirit of God
[1:13:54] anointed
[1:13:57] aha anointed notice this they can
[1:14:00] absolutely have that they shout of the
[1:14:02] spirit they can have anointed on the
[1:14:03] spirit but still be lost and just as
[1:14:06] devil possessed as they can be with that
[1:14:10] spirit so what could you could have the
[1:14:13] isua
[1:14:14] baptism and go to
[1:14:17] hell because the isua baptism though it
[1:14:20] was a work of restoration was not the
[1:14:23] token I'm talking about the gift to
[1:14:26] speak in tongues they in fact took that
[1:14:27] and said it was the evidence of the Holy
[1:14:29] Ghost to speak in tongues you could
[1:14:31] brother B says I've seen Witch Doctor
[1:14:33] speak in tongues right and so when we
[1:14:36] read this that don't mean one thing
[1:14:38] you're going to heaven you can have
[1:14:39] brother random is not saying you can be
[1:14:41] born of the spirit of God and be
[1:14:44] lost right and he says be lost just as
[1:14:48] Devil's best thing can be brother ROM
[1:14:49] says this is the think men's filter now
[1:14:51] father continu to the message the God of
[1:14:52] this world the anointed ones in the last
[1:14:54] day that outside the middle Circle so he
[1:14:55] gives the circles the Outer Circle you
[1:14:57] know this very well greatest battle ever
[1:15:00] fought the Outer Circle who's the Outer
[1:15:03] Circle who's the Inner Circle memory
[1:15:05] conscience reason imagination affection
[1:15:07] your spirit but then that little Inner
[1:15:10] Circle is the soul that is
[1:15:14] you this is not necessarily you this is
[1:15:19] really you one day this will be real the
[1:15:21] real
[1:15:22] me right now it's still mixed up with
[1:15:25] sin brother R says now he goes back to
[1:15:28] the circles and he says the ano the
[1:15:30] outside middle circle the first Circle
[1:15:32] the human sin second circle is the
[1:15:33] spirit will self- will desire but the
[1:15:36] inside is the soul that Soul was
[1:15:38] predestinated so they can anoint the
[1:15:40] spirit to make the outside body come in
[1:15:43] subject to the spirit but the soul that
[1:15:45] sinth he quotes that shall die Soul
[1:15:46] shall die the soul that rejects in
[1:15:50] unbelief the word of God which it is a
[1:15:52] part of that Soul shall ET turn Ally has
[1:15:55] always the spirit can come out here and
[1:15:59] anoint you to do certain things and do
[1:16:01] that but that don't mean you're saved
[1:16:04] think of it Caiaphas prophesied Judas
[1:16:07] cast out Devils see the spirit anointed
[1:16:13] him this is what it means to have the
[1:16:15] Holy Ghost on your flesh and still go to
[1:16:18] hell that's right the rain falls on the
[1:16:21] just and the unjust the weeds can
[1:16:23] Rejoice with the wheat but it's what's
[1:16:25] at I love this but it's what is at the
[1:16:29] core Hallelujah AR you intellectuals can
[1:16:32] say I accept that sure that looks good I
[1:16:34] believe that that still don't do it no
[1:16:36] sir and the spirit can actually make
[1:16:38] witness of
[1:16:40] it and still it isn't
[1:16:44] so because Works Faith because if that
[1:16:47] Soul hasn't come from God it can make
[1:16:50] all the impersonations out here but it
[1:16:53] cannot be real you can act
[1:16:56] healing
[1:16:58] hello you can act like you have you can
[1:17:02] act like you receive it Christians can
[1:17:04] act like they're
[1:17:06] Christians and act and ever be so good
[1:17:10] at it boy have we ever seen
[1:17:13] this
[1:17:14] hello man that brother was a preacher
[1:17:17] then the next year he's in
[1:17:19] adultery and he's lost his church cuz he
[1:17:21] was sleeping with another
[1:17:23] woman and he was a pastor preaching the
[1:17:25] message you say brother Matt did he have
[1:17:27] the Holy Ghost I have no doubt that he
[1:17:29] had the Holy Ghost
[1:17:31] here and even had a spirit witness of
[1:17:35] it I I got the testimony of a pastor
[1:17:38] just two hours from here that had a man
[1:17:39] that fell into adultery to this day he's
[1:17:41] living in adultery and he was a prolific
[1:17:44] profound minister of the message uh in
[1:17:46] the in the message preachers powerful
[1:17:48] preacher living with another woman and
[1:17:50] now has went back to his church and
[1:17:52] trying to get them to justify his second
[1:17:53] wife
[1:17:55] and that Pastor not him not the man who
[1:17:58] did but another Pastor said what's so
[1:17:59] confusing is he says that I would invite
[1:18:02] that man to come preaching my Sunday
[1:18:03] night service this is long before live
[1:18:05] streaming or anything like that or phone
[1:18:07] they had no phone hookup and he said
[1:18:09] that man would come to my Sunday night
[1:18:11] service and preach everything I preach
[1:18:13] Sunday
[1:18:14] morning you want to talk about an
[1:18:16] anointing and he said and all the while
[1:18:18] he was coming to my church to see that
[1:18:20] other
[1:18:23] woman you see brother you say brother
[1:18:25] Matt why why is it so important that we
[1:18:27] rightly divide these things because if
[1:18:28] you don't then people become so confused
[1:18:30] to say well what is the Holy Ghost if
[1:18:33] that soul is a cover it can make all the
[1:18:35] impersonations out here but it cannot be
[1:18:37] real you can act healing you can act
[1:18:38] like Christians they act and be ever so
[1:18:40] good but that don't mean they're saved
[1:18:42] that's exactly right the spirit can be
[1:18:44] there the real genuine Spirit the Holy
[1:18:49] Spirit how many have heard false
[1:18:50] anointed ones at the end time listen
[1:18:54] real an
[1:18:55] anointing false
[1:18:57] vessels real the Holy Spirit can anoint
[1:19:00] you that still don't mean you're saved
[1:19:03] it's that inside Soul That Never Dies
[1:19:06] it's got the eternal life it always was
[1:19:08] eternal life see it comes from God it
[1:19:11] goes to God it's the soul notice it's
[1:19:14] got to be Faith five F AI t h outside
[1:19:18] Spirit j s u s on the inside y u see
[1:19:22] that's how standing here looking at you
[1:19:24] I don't know one of you the spirit can
[1:19:26] anoint me still I don't know none of you
[1:19:28] but when that inside of the inside
[1:19:30] breaks in that's
[1:19:32] God that's where the outside can reason
[1:19:35] you take a man and say well you know I
[1:19:37] know I'm not supposed to commit adultery
[1:19:38] listen to this take a man and say well I
[1:19:42] know I'm not supposed to commit adultery
[1:19:44] but you know when the spirit tells me I
[1:19:46] shouldn't commit adultery brother Bram
[1:19:48] says but you know when the spirit tells
[1:19:49] me I shouldn't commit adultery but you
[1:19:50] see way down in there is still that
[1:19:54] thing in there see it'll kind of govern
[1:19:57] around better watch
[1:20:00] it he's saying when you hear I know I
[1:20:03] shouldn't and I know I shouldn't I
[1:20:05] shouldn't do that brother man says what
[1:20:07] is that that's a spirit that but he says
[1:20:09] it's so let me just let the prophet say
[1:20:11] it but when it's directed from the
[1:20:13] inside it throws all the rest of it
[1:20:17] together that's the guide poost that's
[1:20:19] the control tower the inside of the
[1:20:22] inside the soul controls the spirit the
[1:20:24] Spirit controls the body so an outside
[1:20:27] whitewash don't make any difference them
[1:20:29] religious people back there that called
[1:20:31] Paul wet white Whited walls and so forth
[1:20:33] they were that there that Paul called
[1:20:36] Whited walls and so forth they were
[1:20:38] outward just every way of a Believer and
[1:20:40] they had prophesies prophecies among
[1:20:42] them and everything else but the inside
[1:20:44] of the inside the soul that disbelieve
[1:20:48] that's the reason I say people can jump
[1:20:50] up and down speak in tongues people can
[1:20:52] shout lay hands on the sick heal the
[1:20:55] sick heal the sick and so forth by faith
[1:20:58] and these great things there by the
[1:21:00] spirit still be
[1:21:03] lost anointed ones my goodness anointed
[1:21:08] ones you say I got the baptism of the
[1:21:10] Holy Ghost that don't mean that you're
[1:21:12] saved not by a long way look at here
[1:21:15] you're a Triune being and you are inside
[1:21:17] that little fella here is the soul the
[1:21:19] next is the spirit the next is the body
[1:21:21] now you got five sents in this body to
[1:21:23] contact your Earthly home you don't
[1:21:24] contact the rest of it you got five
[1:21:26] senses of the spirit here love and
[1:21:28] conscious so forth of that but in here
[1:21:30] is where you live that's what you are
[1:21:34] didn't Jesus say the rain falls on the
[1:21:35] just and the unjust put a cockabur out
[1:21:38] here and a weed out here and pour water
[1:21:40] on them and keep them under fertilized
[1:21:42] and things like that won't they both
[1:21:44] live by the same water amen sure well
[1:21:47] what is it one of them will bear a
[1:21:49] cockle bur cuz that's all he is the
[1:21:53] cocko will ra raise his hands and Shout
[1:21:56] just the same as the
[1:22:00] wheat so notice this here if you if you
[1:22:02] follow this brother Brandon would say
[1:22:04] you can you can have an isua baptism let
[1:22:07] me just go through a few of these uh
[1:22:10] that I have forgive me that I keep
[1:22:12] jumping back and forth but I didn't get
[1:22:13] it all on the screen I don't think I
[1:22:15] need to I don't think I need to read
[1:22:17] anymore to say that what the ausa
[1:22:21] Pentecostals thought was the return of
[1:22:23] Acts 21 was
[1:22:26] not they were still under the age of
[1:22:30] men under a man anointing the anointing
[1:22:33] of the
[1:22:34] reformers isua had an outpouring of the
[1:22:37] spirit just as Luther and Wesley did but
[1:22:40] the fullness hadn't yet come can I get
[1:22:43] an amen you could actually as we just
[1:22:45] read have the isua baptism you can have
[1:22:48] just the isua baptism today and be lost
[1:22:51] friends there was ever a time for the
[1:22:53] token to be on display it's
[1:22:56] now you can actually have that isua
[1:22:59] baptism because why brother mat because
[1:23:01] it wasn't the person of Christ you see
[1:23:03] there's such a difference between having
[1:23:05] his
[1:23:07] gifts and having his fruits and those
[1:23:10] are good and they will be there but
[1:23:13] there's such a difference in having
[1:23:16] him say Well it must be the fruits by
[1:23:19] their fruits I what is the evidence
[1:23:22] brother matthan by their fruits you
[1:23:23] shall know them brother says I I thought
[1:23:25] that too and they said brother ma they
[1:23:28] said brother Brandon what is the true
[1:23:29] evidence of the Holy Ghost brother BR
[1:23:30] said love when you really
[1:23:33] love brother BR said sounded
[1:23:37] good sounded right but he said the angel
[1:23:40] the Lord corrected me and told me Noe
[1:23:42] that's not
[1:23:43] it because I've seen Christian Science
[1:23:46] perform all the fruits of the spirit and
[1:23:48] they don't even believe in the deity of
[1:23:49] Jesus Christ then it must be his gifts
[1:23:52] no see witch doctors yeah speak with
[1:23:55] tongues then what is it brother Matt
[1:23:58] being able to say
[1:24:00] Amen brother and sister that doesn't
[1:24:03] mean amen I believe the
[1:24:06] message that man I just talked about
[1:24:08] said
[1:24:10] amen amen means to come
[1:24:16] obedient to
[1:24:18] all that Christ has said can you say
[1:24:21] amen amen so you'll find that brother
[1:24:23] brandham even the Bible becomes a new
[1:24:26] book under that under that before the
[1:24:29] message before the but brother Adam did
[1:24:32] not start his ministry even quoting
[1:24:34] Malachi 4 it wasn't until years later he
[1:24:36] seen his position in Malachi 4 as the
[1:24:39] Elijah Ministry what was it it was not
[1:24:42] yet
[1:24:43] time but when the seals were open and
[1:24:46] Christ took the book brother Bram says
[1:24:48] the Bible become a brand new
[1:24:52] book prior to that he teaches things
[1:24:55] like that the new birth that being born
[1:24:58] again and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:00] are two separate things you say well my
[1:25:02] goodness brother he also teach the white
[1:25:04] horse rider was Christ do we think the
[1:25:06] white horse rider is Christ no because
[1:25:07] the angel of the Lord corrected that you
[1:25:09] see even the angel wouldn't allow
[1:25:11] brother brandom to be
[1:25:12] wrong but would correct his
[1:25:15] teaching he taught that there was a
[1:25:17] persecution that was going to come to
[1:25:19] run all the denominations together and
[1:25:21] they would throw down all their walls
[1:25:22] and all denominational walls and bearers
[1:25:25] if we could just tear down these walls
[1:25:26] what we realize later is brother brand
[1:25:28] would say actually God came to
[1:25:31] separate and bring a people out of
[1:25:33] denominations not run them together but
[1:25:36] to bring them out of denominations for
[1:25:38] his name Revelations 18:4 come out of
[1:25:40] her that's your
[1:25:41] message come out of her not be joined
[1:25:44] with her come out of her my my people be
[1:25:47] not partake her of her sins not so that
[1:25:49] you receive not her plagues so he had
[1:25:52] these these ideas those are just a few
[1:25:54] things I could point out but when the
[1:25:56] Bible become a new
[1:25:59] book do you realize that even the Jews
[1:26:03] even uh even the Passover that that God
[1:26:06] was going to do something so profound
[1:26:08] when he gave a token when they would
[1:26:10] come out of Egypt because that Exodus
[1:26:11] was going to type your Exodus that the
[1:26:14] Bible actually says God told Moses to
[1:26:16] tell the people to take your calendar
[1:26:18] and throw it
[1:26:20] out and he says because this day will
[1:26:23] become the beginning of the New Year for
[1:26:24] you do you realize I just read that
[1:26:27] today friends that God says this shall
[1:26:29] be the beginning of months what was
[1:26:31] going to Mark a brand new beginning the
[1:26:34] giving of the
[1:26:37] Lamb Hallelujah do you realize do you
[1:26:39] catch it friends the calendar became new
[1:26:43] everything became new when the word is
[1:26:45] given they were given a new day a new
[1:26:48] look a new idea everything became new
[1:26:51] and when God restored this word the
[1:26:53] entire world became a new world the book
[1:26:56] became a new book I became a different
[1:26:59] person I looked at myself differently I
[1:27:01] looked at the Devil differently I looked
[1:27:03] at God differently when God reveals
[1:27:06] himself to you oh somebody help me
[1:27:08] preach tonight when God reveals himself
[1:27:10] to you everything becomes brand
[1:27:15] new this shall be a
[1:27:19] beginning the beginning of the year the
[1:27:22] Jews literally took their calendar and
[1:27:25] ripped it up and God says from now on
[1:27:29] the Passover the Pascal lamb this will
[1:27:32] be a new day what was it marking that
[1:27:35] God was going to send a lamb one day and
[1:27:39] when he sent that lamb the entire world
[1:27:41] was going to change the Covenant was
[1:27:43] going to change it was going to change
[1:27:45] my death sentence to a life sentence it
[1:27:47] was going to change my destiny to from
[1:27:49] Hell To
[1:27:53] Heaven so the so so brother brandham
[1:27:55] would I got three minutes Siri says
[1:27:57] three minutes
[1:27:59] so stay patient
[1:28:02] oh better not do that brother
[1:28:04] John somebody else's alarm will go off
[1:28:07] I'm sure a few people said
[1:28:08] [Laughter]
[1:28:10] them and so you'll find that brother
[1:28:12] Brenham teaches his church that the new
[1:28:15] birth he calls it this believing or
[1:28:17] having faith in Christ is not the same
[1:28:20] as receiving the Holy Ghost and that
[1:28:22] you're born again the he would say that
[1:28:24] you're born again the moment you believe
[1:28:25] well we know that brother baram the
[1:28:28] continuity of the message would show you
[1:28:29] that that's not was not correct that
[1:28:32] brother bram's errors were corrected at
[1:28:34] the opening of the
[1:28:38] word is that all right you say well them
[1:28:41] brother Mar why would he say things like
[1:28:43] that because he had people in his
[1:28:46] Fellowship that believed they had the
[1:28:48] Holy Ghost when they hadn't even been
[1:28:52] Sanctified he would say he would say
[1:28:54] things like God now I'm not saying
[1:28:56] you're not born again I'm just saying
[1:28:58] you haven't received the Holy
[1:29:00] Ghost you see how much confusion that
[1:29:02] would bring us well then I I can be born
[1:29:04] again but not have the Holy Ghost no
[1:29:06] you're only born again when you receive
[1:29:08] the Holy
[1:29:10] Ghost right but he be had people would
[1:29:13] say I'm not saying you're not born again
[1:29:14] but you're still out here smoking go
[1:29:16] read Blasphemous names your your
[1:29:18] daughters are still cutting their hair
[1:29:20] name all these sinful things and say
[1:29:23] they were born again you say the out
[1:29:24] what was he trying to do he's trying to
[1:29:25] get them to realize you have received
[1:29:28] something I'm not taking everything away
[1:29:30] from you but I'm trying to get you to
[1:29:32] understand you must receive more than
[1:29:34] what you've
[1:29:36] received and so he teaches this I'm just
[1:29:38] going to move since we've just got one
[1:29:40] minute
[1:29:41] left it's going to move very quickly
[1:29:43] here and so brother bandam says so if a
[1:29:47] man listen listen to I just want to I'm
[1:29:49] going to skip all of that and we'll pick
[1:29:50] it up another
[1:29:52] time I just want to come to one quote
[1:29:55] that I think makes it so clear what we
[1:29:59] understand clearly because we have the
[1:30:01] privilege of having the message from
[1:30:03] beginning to
[1:30:05] end is the what we what we see clearly
[1:30:08] is that being able to study the message
[1:30:10] from the beginning to the end is that
[1:30:13] actually his teaching on sermons like
[1:30:16] Blasphemous names and return and Jubilee
[1:30:18] the key to the door stature of a perfect
[1:30:20] man even countdown in 1962 and he calls
[1:30:23] that message statue of per of a perfect
[1:30:25] man building the living Tabernacle for
[1:30:27] the living God's dwelling place is
[1:30:29] actually those messages of what brother
[1:30:32] Bam's calling Born Again are actually
[1:30:33] what we know is
[1:30:35] justification and
[1:30:37] sanctification this one quote and I
[1:30:40] don't have it but I'm going to read it I
[1:30:41] think I if I could if I could surmise it
[1:30:44] down into one quote that I think says It
[1:30:47] Best in comparing to his previous
[1:30:50] thinking before the Lord corrected him
[1:30:52] before the word was open I should say in
[1:30:55] 1963 this is now 1964 whyatt had to be a
[1:30:59] Shepherd why it had to be
[1:31:01] Shepherds now I know
[1:31:04] terminologies of what born again is but
[1:31:07] let's just watch what happened in the
[1:31:09] Bible when they were born again Peter
[1:31:11] was a Believer the apostles were
[1:31:13] Believers this is prior to being born
[1:31:16] again Peter was a Believer before he was
[1:31:18] born
[1:31:19] again
[1:31:20] hello and he says Peter was a Believer
[1:31:23] the apostles were for a Believer but
[1:31:24] they wasn't born again
[1:31:27] until after the Holy Ghost fell on them
[1:31:32] at
[1:31:34] Pentecost brother brandham clears it up
[1:31:36] even better in the saman church AG you
[1:31:38] say well then what's Galatians 4 and and
[1:31:41] the adoption of sons do you realize it's
[1:31:43] Galatians 4 that brother Ram uses to
[1:31:46] preach the Capstone the the triumphal in
[1:31:50] that that the the the let me read it as
[1:31:52] as he says it the triumphal Capstone
[1:31:54] listen to what he says he says now comes
[1:31:57] our triumphal Capstone on the baptism of
[1:32:00] the Holy Ghost Galatians 4 and he quotes
[1:32:02] it when the fullness of time was come
[1:32:04] God forth s s of son made of a woman
[1:32:06] made it the law to the red under the law
[1:32:08] that we might receive the adoption of
[1:32:10] sons and because we are Sons God has
[1:32:12] sent forth his Spirit of sent forth the
[1:32:15] spirit of his son into our hearts crying
[1:32:17] ABA father wherefore wherefore thou are
[1:32:20] no more a servant but a son and if a son
[1:32:23] then an heir of God through Christ there
[1:32:25] it is Jesus this is the prophet there it
[1:32:28] is Jesus Christ came forth died upon a
[1:32:30] cross accomplish Redemption which means
[1:32:33] to restore hello somebody what is
[1:32:36] redemption to restore to the original
[1:32:40] owner by means of purchase or paying the
[1:32:44] price and thereby placed us as Sons he
[1:32:50] did not make us Sons for we were all
[1:32:53] already his sons when was you a Son of
[1:32:57] God brother Donald when you were in
[1:33:00] sin Brother Brad when were you a Son of
[1:33:04] God hallelujah that's right brother Ken
[1:33:07] when were you a son when were you a
[1:33:09] daughter of God when I was born and when
[1:33:12] I came up no that's not win you were
[1:33:15] already a
[1:33:17] son oh it makes it so clear when you get
[1:33:19] a revelation of that I was always a son
[1:33:23] so what did what did the baptism of the
[1:33:25] Holy Ghost give me it adopted me into
[1:33:28] the family it took a son that was an
[1:33:30] orphan it would took a son who was an
[1:33:33] alien from God but a son in the back
[1:33:35] part of God's mind before the foundation
[1:33:37] of the world and it placed me back into
[1:33:40] the
[1:33:41] family Glory he did not make us Sons for
[1:33:45] we were already his sons but he placed
[1:33:47] us as Sons for as long as we were in the
[1:33:50] world in the flesh we could not be Rec
[1:33:53] recognized as his sons we were held
[1:33:56] captive by the devil but we were Sons
[1:33:59] nonetheless oh don't you love this
[1:34:01] message friends you might have not look
[1:34:03] like it but you were a son take courage
[1:34:06] Mom and Dad they might not look like it
[1:34:08] but in the back part of God's mind
[1:34:10] before the foundation of the world
[1:34:12] before Satan ever put his hands on them
[1:34:14] they were Sons and Daughters of God and
[1:34:17] one day he'll place them back into his
[1:34:20] family
[1:34:22] Hallelujah for as long as we were in the
[1:34:24] world we were Sons nonetheless and hear
[1:34:26] this because you are Sons God hath sent
[1:34:29] forth the spirit of his son into your
[1:34:32] heart whereby you cry father father upon
[1:34:35] whom did the Spirit fall at Pentecost
[1:34:39] Sons them at
[1:34:41] Corinth Sons cornelius's house sons
[1:34:47] while they heard the word what is the
[1:34:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost let's let
[1:34:53] brother Brandon answer it it is the
[1:34:55] spirit baptizing you into the body of
[1:34:58] Christ it is the new
[1:35:02] birth it is the spirit of God coming in
[1:35:05] and filling you after you have repented
[1:35:08] having hear heard his word and been
[1:35:09] baptized in water as an answer of a good
[1:35:12] conscience towards God Amen stand to
[1:35:16] your
[1:35:17] feet are you thankful to be a
[1:35:19] son you thankful to be a daughter to be
[1:35:22] a son and daughter of God to be part of
[1:35:24] this family of God brother bram's
[1:35:27] teaching us that we were always Sons but
[1:35:30] like orphans away from God alienated by
[1:35:33] what brother Matt by not what you did
[1:35:36] listen friends what alienated you from
[1:35:38] God don't let me lose you I'm still
[1:35:40] preaching Siri might have said I'm dumb
[1:35:42] but I'm still going I got this little
[1:35:43] break right here you say brother Matt
[1:35:46] what what what made me an orphan what
[1:35:48] separated me from God listen friends not
[1:35:51] your sins your birth
[1:35:55] birth just being born right and
[1:35:59] breathing
[1:36:00] breath separated you from
[1:36:03] God that's why Paul says the creature
[1:36:06] was made subject to vanity not
[1:36:11] willingly in other words I didn't ask to
[1:36:13] come into this world in sin but I was
[1:36:16] made captive and a slave to sin when I
[1:36:19] breathed my first breath but as brother
[1:36:22] brandham says you don't have to stay
[1:36:23] that
[1:36:24] way God gave Mercy to make a way back
[1:36:29] you don't have to stay a center brother
[1:36:30] brandom says oh he says if you ever go
[1:36:32] to hell you have to fight every inch of
[1:36:34] your life you have to you have to break
[1:36:37] over every barricade jump over every
[1:36:39] barrier to go to hell you'd have to
[1:36:41] break over every Act of Mercy that God
[1:36:44] has put in your
[1:36:46] life you are a alienated but the Holy
[1:36:50] Ghost baptizes you or let me say this
[1:36:53] adopts you am back into the family this
[1:36:58] is exactly what the body change is your
[1:37:02] body gets what your soul has already
[1:37:06] received that's why Paul says all nature
[1:37:09] all creation granth and travaileth how
[1:37:11] many are how many can I identify with
[1:37:14] nature and say this is this is what the
[1:37:17] Earth feels all creation you think you
[1:37:19] think the Earth isn't talking about
[1:37:21] naturalists listen friends the Earth is
[1:37:23] every bit much of alive alive as you are
[1:37:26] brother Adam says the Earth was in the
[1:37:27] book of life before the foundation of
[1:37:29] the world God had the Earth in his mind
[1:37:31] and one day this Earth though it might
[1:37:33] be filled with sin right now one day
[1:37:35] will rid itself of sin it'll receive a
[1:37:38] fiery baptism and there won't be no more
[1:37:40] war on my Holy Mountain says God there
[1:37:42] won't be no more hatred there won't be
[1:37:45] no more evil there won't be no more
[1:37:47] bitterness there won't be no more anger
[1:37:49] there won't be no more tempers there
[1:37:51] won't be nothing else nothing to harm us
[1:37:53] oh I'm looking forward to that day when
[1:37:56] this body receives what my soul says
[1:37:59] amen Lord my soul says I believe it with
[1:38:02] all of my
[1:38:04] heart one day my body will get what my
[1:38:07] soul's already received I'm looking
[1:38:10] forward to that day all creation granth
[1:38:13] and travelleth together until now
[1:38:15] waiting for what the
[1:38:17] manifestations of the sons of God to wit
[1:38:21] the Redemption of the body the fullness
[1:38:23] of
[1:38:24] adoption what will it mean what are you
[1:38:26] working towards now brother Matt what
[1:38:28] what do you believe about adoption what
[1:38:30] do you believe about this supreme token
[1:38:32] I believe that God has given us a
[1:38:34] supreme token and that Supreme token is
[1:38:37] not just here to tell me who I was I'm
[1:38:40] thankful to know who I was not to tell
[1:38:42] me who I'm going to be I'm thankful for
[1:38:44] who I'm going to be but it's telling me
[1:38:45] who I am now it condemn it convicts me
[1:38:48] of sin are you thankful for that it

[1:39:06] reprove what's it doing it's reproving
[1:39:08] sin it speaks to me and says you know
[1:39:11] that ain't right you got to make it

[1:39:29] conquer
[1:39:31] this he's trying to
[1:39:34] overcome what was the greatest Victory

[1:39:58] not right you actually need to become
[1:40:00] more
[1:40:02] weak and I just want to raise a hand and
[1:40:04] I'll invite you to do it with me to say
