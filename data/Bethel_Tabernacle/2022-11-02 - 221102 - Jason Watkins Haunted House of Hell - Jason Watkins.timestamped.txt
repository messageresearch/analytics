[25:30] to us and the day and hour that we live
[25:32] in this is uh this is uh you're you're
[25:36] living in the Fulfillment of this verse
[25:39] and it's being fulfilled actually it's
[25:41] it's partially fulfilled and being
[25:43] fulfilled and will continue to be
[25:45] fulfilled after the bride is gone verse
[25:48] 7 Revelation 6 verse 7.
[25:53] and when he had opened the fourth seal I
[25:56] heard the voice of the fourth Beast say
[25:58] come and see
[26:01] and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and
[26:05] his name that sat on him was death and
[26:08] Hell Followed him and power was given
[26:11] unto them over the fourth part of the
[26:14] earth to kill with sword and with hunger
[26:17] and with death and with the Beast of the
[26:20] earth amen
[26:22] let's pray
[26:26] father we thank you now for your word
[26:30] that's been read and realizing Lord that
[26:33] there's a great blessing in reading it
[26:35] and in hearing it read we ask you now to
[26:38] come and anoint it Lord to our hearts
[26:40] now father it must go to our hearts
[26:43] there there it's impossible for us to
[26:46] achieve this station and that we desire
[26:50] Lord to stand before you Lord in the in
[26:53] the Robes of your righteousness that
[26:56] can't ever happen Lord with just a mere
[26:59] mental decision it's got to be revealed
[27:02] to the heart of the individual so I pray
[27:05] tonight Lord that you will grant us that
[27:07] great grace and that great favor Lord
[27:10] and reveal it to our hearts tonight
[27:11] we're happy to be home we thank you for
[27:15] the Saints gathered here with us Lord
[27:17] there's just a few under the weather
[27:19] tonight we'll be offering prayer for
[27:21] them shortly but Lord we want to look
[27:24] into the word and see what it is you
[27:25] have to say to us this evening we commit
[27:28] ourselves into your hands in Jesus name
[27:31] amen God bless you as you are seated
[27:43] I'm sure you all know my title
[27:46] amen I thought to myself actually I I
[27:48] didn't really think of this until after
[27:50] the fact but
[27:52] um you know when I when I I realized
[27:55] that there's been a lot going on with
[27:57] haunted houses and Halloween and all
[27:59] kinds of things like that I I tell you
[28:01] I'm I'm glad to be free of the influence
[28:04] of this world but I thought to myself as
[28:08] I was pondering that when I realized
[28:11] that my goodness this is my very title
[28:14] haunted house of hell now brother
[28:19] Branham you're going to realize here in
[28:21] just a little bit I'll read it in just a
[28:23] few minutes about a dream that he had
[28:25] about people who were in what was said
[28:30] to him was a house of hell and we
[28:33] realized that when we come into the day
[28:36] and hour that we are living in that the
[28:39] fourth seal is open and the fourth be
[28:42] saying come and see and here is a Pale
[28:45] Horse now the thing that makes him pale
[28:47] it's it's not it's not pale just like
[28:50] like a a ghostly white it's a sickly
[28:54] color that's like you see someone sick
[28:57] you say my goodness they're very pale
[28:59] and it's a it's a grizzled Burly type of
[29:03] sickness it's actually a a combination
[29:06] of the three previous you had the White
[29:10] Horse you had the red horse you had the
[29:12] Black Horse and coming down it's all the
[29:15] same devil he comes into the last age
[29:17] and he is a conglomeration he is the he
[29:21] is the total cluster of all of
[29:24] everything think about it friends of
[29:27] every of every bad thing that has ever
[29:31] been in the world is clustered together
[29:34] today
[29:37] that's why we say that we are living in
[29:42] the worst day of human history there's
[29:45] never been a day thank you brother Kenny
[29:47] like this day in the earth and you know
[29:51] the good news for us is we we're getting
[29:53] hot we're getting out of here
[29:55] oh I I'm so glad that you know the only
[29:59] way out is up and that's I'm glad I got
[30:02] a ticket to go up
[30:04] but for the world brother Branham would
[30:06] talk about that very thing uh coming to
[30:09] the I think his last one of his new year
[30:11] I think his New Year's Eve sermon 1964
[30:14] where he just kind of puts it on the
[30:16] table and says you know it's uh thank
[30:18] you for Luther it's a glorious day for
[30:22] the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[30:25] says now it's a very sad day for those
[30:29] outside of the blood of the Lord for
[30:31] those in the world for those who have
[30:33] made their decision that Satan would be
[30:36] their their God he's the God of this
[30:39] evil age and people had a choice and
[30:42] they have a choice and there's a choice
[30:43] tonight thank God there's a choice
[30:46] say oh I wish there wasn't a choice well
[30:48] that's going to happen for the Gentiles
[30:50] anyway once the bride leaves because God
[30:54] can't bring the Judgment uh and and
[30:57] cross it over blood and because that
[31:00] that the that the the bleeding word is
[31:03] in the bride of Christ then then she's
[31:05] the manifestation of grace and the Earth
[31:08] God can't bring the tribulation while
[31:10] you're here
[31:11] but when you leave Grace leaves you
[31:14] understand when you're gone for the
[31:16] Gentiles then that is the end of it now
[31:19] there's still there's still grace and
[31:21] mercy in the in the world because the
[31:23] gospel goes to the Jews there's still a
[31:25] work of the Lamb to continue and the
[31:28] work of the Lamb continues even after
[31:30] that and there's a lot of the work of
[31:32] the Lamb headed on I know there's some
[31:34] misunderstanding about you know the lamb
[31:36] being finished that's actually not
[31:38] accurate we find all through the Bible
[31:40] that there's many places after we're
[31:43] gone where the lamb is still got a job
[31:46] to do he's still very much active so you
[31:49] know I'm glad to be the Bride of the
[31:52] Lamb I'm glad to be the Lamb's wife and
[31:54] so we find that that this bride even in
[31:58] the Book of Revelation it shows a
[31:59] difference there's a difference to be
[32:01] made you know between the Heavenly
[32:04] Jerusalem or you know the holy Jerusalem
[32:07] I think as the as Paul would call it and
[32:10] then there's the New Jerusalem and
[32:12] that's of course a physical City but yet
[32:15] we also realize that in the Millennium
[32:17] there is a holy Jerusalem there and
[32:20] there is a there is a a holy city amen
[32:24] there's a new city that's coming after
[32:26] the Millennium but in the Millennium
[32:28] there is a holy city called The Heavenly
[32:32] Jerusalem and when John saw that it was
[32:36] a bride prepared for her groom
[32:41] so we we realize then that the bride
[32:44] while she's here we are the conduit of
[32:49] grace and mercy to the world now
[32:53] the Bible says here that this White
[32:56] Horse I'm sorry this Pale Horse when he
[32:59] comes that his name is death
[33:03] and Hell Followed with him so
[33:07] I I don't think it should be that big of
[33:09] a stretch tonight if if we talk about a
[33:13] dream that brother Branham had where he
[33:16] sees people
[33:17] in the Earth today that's a dream now
[33:20] but he had a spiritual connotation that
[33:23] where it was a house of hell that
[33:25] shouldn't be a surprise
[33:27] given that the fourth seal has broken
[33:30] open and when that happens there's a
[33:32] death coming in the land and Hell
[33:34] Followed right with him so we're not
[33:36] just looking for hell as some you know
[33:39] at some place you know after you die
[33:42] hell has come to the surface
[33:45] brother Branham clearly said that the
[33:47] lid is actually torn from hell
[33:50] that's quite a statement
[33:53] we'll take a prophet to say it the lid
[33:55] is torn from hell and demon powers are
[33:58] streaming into the Earth that's the age
[34:00] you live in
[34:01] that's exactly where you are I'm trying
[34:04] to get this mic from to stop popping
[34:06] like that I'll keep adjusting it I think
[34:08] we'll get it
[34:09] so so that is that's the reality of the
[34:13] earth that we live in now I I love the
[34:16] fact that you know when we if you look
[34:19] in first Thessalonians 5 I'm not going
[34:21] to go there tonight
[34:22] but we find that you know Paul talks
[34:25] about you know uh I mean it's a it's a
[34:28] real message of Doom Hey Brother Caleb
[34:31] let's put that up just just so we can
[34:32] refresh ourselves first Thessalonians 5
[34:35] and we'll just look at these couple of
[34:37] first couple of three verses I think I
[34:39] think verses one two and three perhaps
[34:42] first Thessalonians 5 and we're to start
[34:44] at verse 1.
[34:46] and if you don't um
[34:48] I can okay here we go
[34:50] all right so
[34:52] Paul's saying here watch this
[34:54] he says but of the times and the seasons
[34:57] Brethren you have no need that I write
[34:59] into you for yourselves know perfectly
[35:01] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[35:04] thief in the night now for when they
[35:06] shall say peace and safety then sudden
[35:09] destruction cometh upon them and he goes
[35:12] on to talk about you know uh but but the
[35:15] good news is God has not appointed us to
[35:18] Wrath
[35:19] we are children of the day we are
[35:22] children of the light we are not of the
[35:25] night we are not of the darkness it is
[35:27] not appointed wrath is not appointed to
[35:29] us the day of the Lord means something
[35:32] very different from for us than it means
[35:35] for the rest of the world
[35:36] the day of the Lord and we find is the
[35:39] time when God is coming to execute his
[35:43] judgment upon the Earth and before he
[35:45] can do that he brings his wife home for
[35:48] a wedding party like has never been
[35:50] recorded
[35:52] and so so we find a wedding supper and a
[35:55] celebration but we but we realize that
[35:58] there is a terrible wrath that's coming
[36:01] upon the Earth and it it is it is not
[36:06] just a destruction but it's a sudden one
[36:09] and then the very fact that it's that
[36:11] it's sudden means that at the at the
[36:14] point where it's going to be destroyed
[36:16] there's no need for a buildup
[36:20] because you're living in the buildup
[36:24] a buildup's not coming a build up is
[36:27] happening
[36:28] this is this is Prelude to tribulation
[36:32] this is a house of Hell on the earth and
[36:36] I'm not talking about a haunted house
[36:38] that they want to put up here because of
[36:40] some Devil's holiday I'm talking about a
[36:44] haunted house and with a haunted house
[36:46] comes a haunting
[36:50] I really am trying to turn into my
[36:54] thought tonight the real burden that the
[36:56] Lord has put upon me
[36:58] brother Branham picks up in the message
[37:01] uncertain sound the uncertain sound he
[37:03] preached it oh my goodness I I glanced
[37:05] at it it looks like at least maybe eight
[37:08] or ten or a dozen times
[37:10] I was drawn which is a little different
[37:12] I usually go if I've got multiples I'll
[37:14] usually and I feel drawn to a certain
[37:16] sermon I'll usually listen to the to the
[37:19] latest one and
[37:21] to my surprise I felt compelled to go to
[37:23] the very first one in 1955 and I have no
[37:26] way to tell you just how unusual that is
[37:28] but it was exactly what the Lord wanted
[37:30] me to do I want him to make some
[37:33] statements tonight and and just try to
[37:35] bring you into into my thought so
[37:38] brother Branham talks about how that the
[37:40] human body
[37:42] that our makeup now this is an
[37:43] astonishing statement that our makeup
[37:45] this Humanity all right that our regular
[37:48] Anatomy that we live in here is not made
[37:52] to sin
[37:56] that's why
[37:58] people who live in sin collapse
[38:03] that's why it's it ruins their life
[38:06] that's that's why believers who stumble
[38:10] into iniquitous Behavior have nervous
[38:12] breakdowns over it
[38:14] because you know you're not you're not
[38:16] meant to lie the child when he tells
[38:18] that first LIE there's something in him
[38:20] telling him don't do that
[38:23] so he said it's it's made and I I love
[38:26] this it's made your this is your human
[38:29] body your regular Anatomy is made to do
[38:33] righteous it's made to serve God
[38:38] I could not give you a better recipe for
[38:42] peace and Harmony and a tranquil life
[38:45] than to say serve God
[38:49] I couldn't give you better advice I
[38:52] couldn't help you anymore you say life
[38:54] is really overwhelming and I got this
[38:56] problem and I got that problem
[38:57] eyewitness say draw closer to him
[39:01] because your body your regular Anatomy
[39:04] is built to for righteousness and and if
[39:09] you and if all you got to do is use the
[39:12] word of God that lives in your soul and
[39:15] put your Fallen flesh under obedience I
[39:19] promise you your body will acquiesce
[39:21] your body will just go right along with
[39:23] it because it was made I go to my knees
[39:26] in prayer quite easily
[39:29] I don't go to my knees at all quite
[39:31] easily but I love going to them in
[39:33] prayer
[39:34] amen
[39:36] so so you know the the the body says I I
[39:40] mean just common the body says I'm too
[39:42] tired to go to church
[39:45] that's not uncommon
[39:46] you're not a sacrilegious person for
[39:48] feeling that way but the inner man loves
[39:51] it and when you get this body here he
[39:54] loves it
[39:55] am I right or wrong I come into the
[39:59] presence of God and I was so tired I
[40:01] barely had to make myself get ready I'm
[40:03] not talking about tonight I'm just
[40:04] speaking metaphorically are in general
[40:06] but but I find that when I come to the
[40:09] house of God I am so glad I came I love
[40:13] clapping my hands and singing songs and
[40:15] worshiping God and feeling the presence
[40:18] of the Lord and hearing the good
[40:19] preaching of the word of God
[40:24] God never made you
[40:27] just to work and come home and love your
[40:29] children
[40:32] that's all good see father Brown's not
[40:35] not doubting that that's good that's
[40:37] good God God made you to work
[40:41] God made you to come home
[40:43] love your children love your wife and
[40:46] the wife to be loyal and love her
[40:48] husband and and the children love their
[40:51] father and mother that's all good that's
[40:54] how God Made You It's the devil that
[40:56] interrupts that
[40:58] when you don't see that happening when
[41:00] you say a home absent of love and the
[41:03] husband doesn't love the wife and vice
[41:04] versa and the children don't respect the
[41:06] parents and they don't love each other
[41:07] and there's absence of love and the
[41:09] absence of respect you know that's the
[41:12] working of this horse rider
[41:15] you know that that's the God of this
[41:17] evil age and he's trying to turn that
[41:20] home into a home of hell
[41:25] I was reading the other morning in a
[41:26] morning devotion Spurgeon I don't
[41:28] remember which day
[41:30] but I thought it was remarkable because
[41:32] he took the scripture where Paul is
[41:34] writing to Anis for us and he says you
[41:37] know I want you to greet those the
[41:38] church that's in your home
[41:41] and so I don't know on this verse
[41:43] perhaps was some type of Pastor maybe
[41:45] they didn't have a church where he lived
[41:46] I don't know maybe they were holding
[41:47] home Bible studies or Home Services he
[41:50] says the church in your home and Charles
[41:52] Spurgeon takes off on that and says I
[41:55] wonder how many of God's family can say
[41:58] our home is church
[42:02] he said where you've got instead of a
[42:04] pastor you've got a father
[42:07] you've got a mother you've got worship
[42:09] you've got the dispensing of the of the
[42:12] of the word of God you've got followers
[42:14] you've got prisoners you've got children
[42:16] brother Brandon called a mother the
[42:18] child's first pastor
[42:20] so I mean I I know that homes
[42:23] today are filled with every kind of
[42:27] entertainment and every kind of vice and
[42:29] every kind of connection to the world I
[42:32] just wonder if we have church in our
[42:34] home
[42:38] first church just a building we come to
[42:40] a couple of times a week
[42:43] something to think about right
[42:46] so when I got to work that's fine God
[42:48] made you to work but he never made you
[42:49] distant work well I love my children
[42:51] that's good you're supposed to but he
[42:53] never made you just to go work and come
[42:54] home and love your children
[42:57] see that's all good see
[43:00] it's all good but that's just the
[43:04] backgrounds for something that God made
[43:07] you to do
[43:09] God made you to be a worshiper
[43:14] a worshiper of him now
[43:18] you say that's that's super simple it's
[43:21] actually has it's more profound than you
[43:23] might think because you being a human
[43:26] you're human right
[43:30] when in Genesis
[43:32] when God made man he breathed into him
[43:34] the breath of life and he became a
[43:37] living soul
[43:38] in the Hebrew that means he became
[43:41] praying dirt
[43:44] you understand
[43:45] because he the human animal the human
[43:49] animal was built to pray he's the only
[43:51] one who does
[43:52] he's the only animal that prays no other
[43:54] animal prays
[43:56] only the human
[43:57] uh your close mammals they don't none of
[44:00] them primates they don't pray at all
[44:02] they have no sense of spirituality
[44:04] only the human because he's building the
[44:06] image of God
[44:08] so if you don't even have a worship life
[44:10] in a prayer life and you're not in
[44:12] connection with your maker then are you
[44:14] a human
[44:16] say well I think I am well not according
[44:18] to the Bible
[44:20] according to the Bible you're just a
[44:22] beast
[44:23] without the Holy Ghost a man unconverted
[44:26] or a woman without the Holy Ghost is
[44:28] just a brute Beast
[44:30] that's scripture
[44:32] see it's def it's certainly not a Man
[44:36] created mankind created in the image of
[44:40] God because mankind created in the image
[44:43] of God is built to worship now even in a
[44:47] fallen condition here's how strong it is
[44:49] even in a fallen condition you'll
[44:51] worship something
[44:53] even if you're not converted even if
[44:55] you're the most ranked Center brother
[44:57] Brandon picks it up here he says he says
[45:00] it's just the backgrounds working loving
[45:02] your children loving your wife having
[45:04] having all of that is just a background
[45:06] it's all to me it's all should be to the
[45:09] purpose say why do I go work so that so
[45:13] that you can have a home that worships
[45:15] God why do I love children so that God
[45:17] will be present
[45:18] you understand working and finances and
[45:21] children and spouses and and family the
[45:24] things we call family we just take it
[45:26] for granted but there's a there's an
[45:28] exact thing that God calls a family
[45:31] and there's a thing the world calls a
[45:33] family they call it a family and they
[45:35] don't even they don't even have the
[45:37] correct marital order sometimes and
[45:40] still call it a family
[45:43] and we'll even bypass nature and live in
[45:46] a perverted relationship and go adopt
[45:48] children so they can have a family
[45:51] that is so twisted
[45:56] to go Global that has that has that has
[45:59] gone viral
[46:01] that was only even possible in the in
[46:04] the 21st century for that there was a
[46:07] local city called Sodom
[46:09] you've had cultures they've had all
[46:12] kinds of Gentile cultures that had that
[46:14] going on in it but it was always Hush
[46:16] Hush behind the scenes but now it's gone
[46:18] viral it's global
[46:20] it's it's completely accepted as normal
[46:24] I'm here to tell you this is a house of
[46:26] hell
[46:27] this is a haunted house we don't got to
[46:29] wait till Halloween you're living in a
[46:31] haunted house
[46:33] with haunted people
[46:39] God made you to be worshiper you worship
[46:40] something regardless of what it is
[46:42] you'll worship your wife your children
[46:43] your any it won't worship anything your
[46:45] automobile you'll worship your pleasure
[46:49] you'll worship something because it's in
[46:51] mankind to worship see now we want to
[46:55] know what we worship
[46:58] you know I one of the things that I was
[47:02] so struck with
[47:04] after the prayer line
[47:06] especially after the prayer line that we
[47:09] held on Saturday night we went down
[47:11] Friday and there's a spontaneous prayer
[47:14] line I guess you would call it that
[47:15] brother Josh didn't even uh I mean
[47:18] brother John didn't even make a call at
[47:19] all
[47:20] but uh the young people just came
[47:22] forward
[47:25] and we walked down and began to pray for
[47:27] them
[47:27] and then Saturday was more of a we set
[47:30] aside like brother Branham done we set
[47:33] aside to have a prayer line
[47:35] nothing wrong with that that's why the
[47:36] prophet ran it so we went down and we
[47:39] had a prayer line we divided out and
[47:41] that way we wouldn't be there all night
[47:42] I wanted to pray for all of them I
[47:43] wanted to pray for everybody I wanted
[47:44] everybody in that building being prayed
[47:46] for
[47:47] so we found a way to do it where they
[47:49] could come up and have some time to
[47:52] express their heart I wasn't there to
[47:53] hear their life story but I wanted to
[47:55] give them an opportunity to to say to
[47:59] say put it on their lips what do you
[48:01] need everyone that would come up I would
[48:03] greet them I would say what do you need
[48:05] what what's on your heart
[48:08] and there was some
[48:11] wonderful experiences there some some
[48:14] such fine quality young men and young
[48:17] ladies who were coming up and just
[48:20] weeping wanting more of God and that I
[48:23] thought that is so unbelievable in the
[48:25] 21st century I mean the the real true
[48:28] and living God is the most unpopular
[48:32] he's never been more unpopular and here
[48:36] is young men and young women beautiful
[48:38] in the prime of their life in the world
[48:40] wanting them but they don't want the
[48:42] world they wanted his majesty the king
[48:47] and then the the sad part of of the 30
[48:52] 20 30 I would say just to throw out off
[48:55] top of my head you know maybe as much as
[48:57] a quarter that came up with such
[48:59] heart-rending my heart went out to them
[49:02] so desperately they had needs that you
[49:06] know they wanted to have the Holy
[49:07] there's a lot of confusion over what it
[49:09] was in their minds and and I even talked
[49:12] to one young man about the Holy Ghost
[49:13] and showing him it's you know I could
[49:16] see struggling he's he's hunting he's
[49:18] he's heard I gotta have it he's a he's
[49:20] already loves the Lord with all of his
[49:22] heart standing there weeping and crying
[49:25] loves God with all of his heart and it
[49:27] reminded me you know of of when I was
[49:30] that age and other young men that I knew
[49:32] at that at that young age and
[49:34] you know and yet he's he he he's unsure
[49:37] is there something I understand I still
[49:39] got to get the the baptism the Holiness
[49:41] and I'm trying to I'm trying to back up
[49:43] and go my goodness where's the where's
[49:45] the balance what teaching I don't even
[49:47] know what church he was from I didn't
[49:48] even ask it's not it's not relevant I'm
[49:50] not here to criticize somebody
[49:53] I'm just simply saying that that I was
[49:56] just able just in a few minutes
[49:58] yeah he actually came to see me after
[50:01] the service on Sunday wanted to talk
[50:03] about it some more and we're standing
[50:05] there and I was just standing there
[50:06] talking to him out of the word of God
[50:07] and I just made a little statement how
[50:09] that the the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[50:11] and the new birth are the same thing
[50:14] and
[50:16] he was he was so stunned to hear that
[50:19] and he said to me I didn't know that
[50:22] and I said oh my yeah I said listen
[50:24] young man I took you more brother
[50:25] Branham is showing that that you know
[50:28] the the new birth is the sieging of God
[50:30] coming forth It's the holy ghost coming
[50:32] upon that it's a revelation of Jesus
[50:34] Christ it's a definite experience
[50:36] it's a moment where God reveals himself
[50:39] to you because you have completely
[50:41] thoroughly absolutely totally one
[50:42] hundred one thousand percent repented of
[50:45] all your life
[50:46] you'll never get the new birth you'll
[50:48] never get the Seal of the Holy Spirit if
[50:50] you don't fully repent if you still try
[50:52] to hold on to things of the world you're
[50:54] wasting your time my time God's time and
[50:57] everybody's time
[50:58] I want to say to you repent thoroughly
[51:01] and the Holy Ghost is yours
[51:06] the the weight that came off of that
[51:09] young man's mind he smiled I could see
[51:12] the confusion evaporate I could see the
[51:14] weight he was under so much pressure and
[51:16] it just evaporated off and he said well
[51:19] I I love God with all my heart and I
[51:21] said I can tell and I said and you want
[51:23] his word yes and you just want more of
[51:25] him yes more and more and more and more
[51:26] and I said my goodness brother it
[51:29] reminded me of that man who came to
[51:30] brother Branham and he said you mean
[51:32] I've had it all this
[51:36] my brother he jumped on the porch and
[51:37] hoisted brother Brandon if that little
[51:39] man could have hoisted me well it would
[51:41] have been hard but he he like he wanted
[51:43] to try
[51:45] he was so relieved to understand that
[51:49] now he's he's marching to Zion and every
[51:51] day he's now he's trying to grow and
[51:53] grow and grow he wants to be filled with
[51:56] all the fullness of the knowledge of the
[51:58] Lord Jesus Christ
[51:59] I never had a greater sense of need
[52:04] our appreciation
[52:06] for balanced Ministry that keeps its
[52:09] balance my brothers my ministering
[52:11] Brothers
[52:12] keep let's keep our balance in the
[52:14] scriptures and in the quotes
[52:16] I I so appreciate that they're they're
[52:19] some of you ministers who are here are
[52:21] raised up under my preaching for years
[52:23] you know that you know that some of you
[52:24] have come along but I I have so
[52:27] appreciated the brothers who have come
[52:29] along who who don't have an agenda and
[52:33] I'm so thankful for that their minds and
[52:35] their hearts are so clean they stand
[52:37] here and just deliver the word of God
[52:39] and I just say blessed be the name of
[52:41] the Lord keep it that way don't ever
[52:44] don't ever get out of balance like that
[52:46] we don't need to we've got a prophet
[52:48] that gave us the saith the Lord on the
[52:50] word of God
[52:53] I so appreciate that
[52:55] words would fail me to tell you how much
[52:58] I appreciate that
[53:00] but on the road of life people
[53:03] sometimes make devastating choices I
[53:05] heard on the
[53:06] bible study this morning
[53:08] I don't know who said it it was said he
[53:10] said he heard another Minister say it
[53:12] brother Tim Calhoun was at a Minister's
[53:14] meeting he didn't say who was it said it
[53:16] but it was so noteworthy and worth
[53:18] repeating
[53:20] the minister said remember
[53:24] that for every mile of road
[53:26] there are two miles of ditches
[53:30] that's what I said
[53:32] um
[53:34] wow
[53:35] I'm going to write that down and I did
[53:37] typed it down
[53:45] I do
[53:46] not the decisions you make I get you
[53:48] working you love the family you love
[53:50] children or wife or whatever you got a
[53:51] home but but that's only the background
[53:54] we're living where the fourth seal has
[53:57] opened and the pale horse rider is is
[54:00] already influencing and the only thing
[54:02] holding him back from his full ride is
[54:05] your departure is your presence
[54:07] he can't get his full ride until until
[54:10] we're gone and so I just say Lord God
[54:13] let me I found myself saying let me
[54:15] preach it harder let me let me pray more
[54:18] let me try longer I gotta find the lost
[54:21] at any cost we must never spare any
[54:23] expense we've got to find God's family
[54:28] all of my family all of your family all
[54:31] of our loved ones who are out there I'm
[54:33] not going to give up I'm not going to
[54:34] give up we're going to keep praying
[54:36] we're going to keep pressing we're going
[54:37] to keep preaching
[54:39] [Music]
[54:43] brother Branham
[54:45] in this message gives a a story he calls
[54:50] it Mrs John Doe now
[54:53] what he doesn't reveal here
[54:56] is he and nobody knows at the time
[54:59] but he's actually talking about an exact
[55:02] case that he dealt with that doesn't
[55:04] become clear until years later he
[55:05] finally decides I guess to spill the
[55:07] beans and and talk about it that it was
[55:09] an actual story here he's just telling
[55:12] them he said you know I just want to I
[55:14] just want to make it like an example
[55:18] and although when he's going down the
[55:21] line I'm sitting there saying my if I'd
[55:23] have been sitting there in 1955 I'd have
[55:25] said wow this guy's an incredible
[55:27] Storyteller he needs to write he needs
[55:28] to be an author
[55:29] because the details are crazy
[55:32] and but then I realized wait a minute
[55:34] yeah he's telling a real story no wonder
[55:37] see
[55:38] I know that those people didn't know
[55:40] that in 1955 in his Tabernacle
[55:43] he starts telling he calls her will call
[55:45] her and Mrs John Doe she's a good woman
[55:47] as far as we know she married Mr doe he
[55:49] was a fine Christian man
[55:52] I remember he's telling a true story
[55:54] passing it off
[55:56] you know it's just a spiritual example
[56:00] so brother Branham goes into this long
[56:03] elaborate story it's not actually that
[56:05] long
[56:06] but it's very intricate and very
[56:08] elaborate how that this woman you know
[56:10] she she got into feeling like maybe she
[56:13] didn't love Mr doe as much as she had at
[56:16] one time and suddenly she catches the
[56:19] eye of another married man and they kind
[56:21] of make eye contact and there's a little
[56:23] chemistry they meet at the fence and
[56:25] they talk a little bit and next thing
[56:27] you know you know people are going to be
[56:29] out of town and the next thing you know
[56:31] here goes in a fair full-blown starts up
[56:33] and and this woman is now you know
[56:36] living in a backslid and the home breaks
[56:39] up and bustes up and but but brother
[56:41] Branham says but she was a you know in a
[56:44] fine Church
[56:46] and I think she's even a Sunday school
[56:48] teacher
[56:49] and it's not revealed here but I
[56:51] remember it from another rendering of
[56:53] this
[56:54] and how that you know it it got to the
[56:57] point where now the the cheater man he
[57:00] he realizes he doesn't really like her
[57:03] anyway it was just a fling and he's
[57:05] going to go back to his wife now she's
[57:07] her home's busted
[57:09] and so what does she do she you know she
[57:13] starts thinking you know nobody was as
[57:15] kind to me as John was nobody was as
[57:18] pleasant but and she actually thought
[57:20] about maybe I'll try to go back and be
[57:22] reconciled but what she couldn't
[57:24] overcome was that wild side that just
[57:26] wanted to keep going
[57:28] and so she found her another lover and
[57:30] then another one and then another one
[57:32] and brother Brandon says all the while
[57:34] she's still teaching Sunday school she's
[57:36] still right there in church she's now
[57:38] she's married again and then that's over
[57:39] then she's married again and and the
[57:41] preacher's telling her you know it's all
[57:43] right you're you're a fine upstanding
[57:45] member of this church and we respect you
[57:47] and I you've had this kind of a life but
[57:49] don't you worry God understands you know
[57:51] and all this kind of stuff and brother
[57:52] Brown was just telling this whole story
[57:56] and finally brother but I'm talking
[57:58] about the difference between you know
[58:01] your mind actually your brain which part
[58:03] of your biology
[58:05] it's going to be important in the story
[58:08] and he says you know Salvation doesn't
[58:10] come in the mind I mean you make a
[58:12] decision for Christ but it's got to drop
[58:14] 18 inches into your heart and become a
[58:16] living revelation
[58:18] that's why people miss it a lot of times
[58:23] they as brother Brennan says they admire
[58:25] the fine qualities of Jesus
[58:28] but it's just a it's just a an
[58:30] intellectual experience
[58:33] and uh it's not it's not a hard
[58:35] experience it doesn't really change
[58:36] their life
[58:37] and so finally she goes on being told
[58:40] you're okay and doesn't matter the the
[58:42] level of debauchery you're okay it's all
[58:44] good until finally it catches up with
[58:46] her and she catches a public disease
[58:49] and now it starts eating her
[58:51] from the inside out and she's dying
[58:54] and she's laying there on the bed and
[58:56] and she's in the hospital and brother
[58:58] Branham said now he said what happens is
[59:02] as her body is starting to decay
[59:04] he said in the brain cells are starting
[59:07] to Decay he said it's like that little
[59:09] child who told that first lie and it got
[59:12] really and it got easier and it got
[59:13] easier and it got easier and it got
[59:14] easier
[59:16] and you you silenced that conscience
[59:21] it told you don't do that you're a
[59:24] married woman don't go do that but you
[59:25] silenced that conscience
[59:28] until finally brother Brown said the
[59:30] conscience stopped speaking
[59:34] the terrible Dreadful place to be
[59:37] because you don't know at any moment
[59:38] your life might be stuffed out and
[59:39] you're not going to be ready to go meet
[59:41] God
[59:43] and as she goes along she finally is in
[59:45] a hospital and she's dying and there's
[59:48] her preacher who's told her she's okay
[59:51] and brother Branham says now once all
[59:54] now once her brain cells start decaying
[59:56] this thing's eating her brain
[59:58] and suddenly all of that quieted
[1:00:02] conscious comes rushing back
[1:00:05] and in a moment she has this Epiphany
[1:00:08] this understanding I'm lost
[1:00:14] and she looks at her preacher you've
[1:00:16] lied to me
[1:00:18] you told me I was okay I'm not okay and
[1:00:20] I'm I'm being pulled into hell and I can
[1:00:22] already see demons Spirits appearing in
[1:00:25] the room
[1:00:26] and she's starting to scream in the and
[1:00:29] the preacher you know they he I mean he
[1:00:31] got called in there because they tried
[1:00:33] to get him to you know put your
[1:00:34] cigarette out please and come in here
[1:00:36] and try to call him you're pushing her
[1:00:37] down
[1:00:40] which is literally what's what he had to
[1:00:41] do I had to go out and they had to go
[1:00:43] get him because he's outside smoking
[1:00:45] uh can you can you come help us she's
[1:00:47] starting to lose it and he comes in
[1:00:49] there oh now watch this watch this you
[1:00:51] know uh calm down oh you've lied to me
[1:00:53] oh no no nothing of the kind and she's
[1:00:56] getting worse and she's getting worse
[1:00:58] and she's getting worse brother Brown
[1:00:59] says what is it the soul had caught up
[1:01:02] to her
[1:01:03] see the soul and the spirit is the thing
[1:01:06] here that the intellectual is fixing to
[1:01:08] fail it's only in the mind the
[1:01:10] intellectual what you've lived by is
[1:01:12] going to perish but that soul that
[1:01:15] you've grieved from your intellectual is
[1:01:17] going and I this was an astonishing word
[1:01:19] because my title was already haunted
[1:01:21] house
[1:01:23] and brother and I didn't know this line
[1:01:25] was in this sermon God let me do it but
[1:01:28] that soul that you've grieved from your
[1:01:30] intellectual is going to haunt you
[1:01:37] and when This Woman's Soul catches up
[1:01:39] with her she says my God I'm lost
[1:01:43] and they think oh it's Delirious they
[1:01:47] shoot a hypo
[1:01:49] and the needle to her and she begins to
[1:01:53] numb off
[1:01:54] she can't speak no more she's trying oh
[1:02:00] she's rolling she's in agony
[1:02:04] the doctor says give her another one
[1:02:06] she's dying anyway it doesn't matter
[1:02:08] just can't let her die peacefully
[1:02:10] there's no sinner ever died peacefully
[1:02:14] I'm here to tell you friends I I've I've
[1:02:16] been at the bedside of people who didn't
[1:02:19] know the Lord and it wasn't peaceful and
[1:02:21] I've been at the bedside of people dying
[1:02:23] who were saints of God and that was the
[1:02:25] most glorious moment
[1:02:27] everything they had lived for their
[1:02:29] whole life the the Christ they had
[1:02:31] served was going to receive them in two
[1:02:34] Everlasting Paradise
[1:02:38] they give her another one detoner and
[1:02:42] they deaden her
[1:02:43] until the death angel swept her spirit
[1:02:45] from her
[1:02:48] that hypo needle might Dead In the Flesh
[1:02:51] it might deaden the mind
[1:02:53] that can't deaden that soul that knows
[1:02:55] it sinned before God and he says it
[1:02:58] again
[1:02:59] it'll haunt her
[1:03:01] through the ceaseless ages
[1:03:04] he says that soul will haunt and haunt
[1:03:08] and haunt as the ages roll on
[1:03:13] you came from where Prophet is asking
[1:03:16] his audience and in the Tabernacle
[1:03:19] you came from where
[1:03:22] you go to where
[1:03:26] question
[1:03:28] say well I'm here now well when you're
[1:03:29] not here what then
[1:03:31] what's next
[1:03:33] like I said to you
[1:03:35] here recently
[1:03:37] what's the what's the point of life if
[1:03:39] you don't get an eternal life
[1:03:41] make it however happy and Rich and
[1:03:43] joyous and have everything in in the
[1:03:46] world like Solomon
[1:03:48] but Solomon said it's just a chasing of
[1:03:50] the wind it's it's Grievous it vexes him
[1:03:53] that he had blown his whole life out
[1:03:55] chasing the wind and he accomplished it
[1:03:58] he had more treasure more women more
[1:04:00] money more Fame the whole world afraid
[1:04:02] of him
[1:04:03] more power more influence and he comes
[1:04:06] down he's an old man and he says I'm I'm
[1:04:08] angry
[1:04:09] I'm vexed my whole spirit is vexed
[1:04:12] because I realize it's been a chasing of
[1:04:13] the Wind
[1:04:16] and brother Branham says you came from
[1:04:18] where you go to where
[1:04:20] you came out of Eternity you stepped at
[1:04:22] a little space of time you go out of
[1:04:25] time into eternity and what are you in
[1:04:28] your soul as you go out the same you'll
[1:04:32] be
[1:04:34] oh my
[1:04:35] the same you'll be death changes nothing
[1:04:42] brother Branham goes from that Dreadful
[1:04:44] scene
[1:04:46] and he comes to a message many years
[1:04:48] later 10 years later
[1:04:50] to be exact in 1965.
[1:04:54] and he's preaching works his faith
[1:04:56] expressed and he says
[1:04:59] he's telling the experience
[1:05:02] of a dream that he had
[1:05:05] he's starting to tell about being out
[1:05:07] there in Sabino and the brothers and he
[1:05:09] tells the story about brother mchughes
[1:05:12] my daughter-in-law Rachel is her former
[1:05:14] Pastor it had a condition in his eye he
[1:05:17] was going blind his mother had tumors on
[1:05:19] her feet and he's out there with brother
[1:05:21] Branham and this is when that Pillar of
[1:05:22] Fire came down and cut through the
[1:05:24] mountain and and and if you've ever
[1:05:26] heard the testimony of brother mchughes
[1:05:28] it's it's gripping I mean he said when
[1:05:30] that light came down that thing wasn't
[1:05:32] playing he said as it come down the side
[1:05:34] of that of that mountain he said it just
[1:05:36] ripped and sliced and cut and flung
[1:05:38] rocks in every direction and rocks flew
[1:05:40] out with such supersonic speed they cut
[1:05:42] the tops of trees off
[1:05:45] and it just went out like a bomb and
[1:05:47] they're all running and Diving and
[1:05:49] jumping under under vehicles
[1:05:52] and they come to brother Branham said if
[1:05:55] that hit you you'd have been a greasy
[1:05:56] spot he said no he wasn't trying to hurt
[1:05:58] me he said he was talking to me
[1:05:59] wow
[1:06:06] he said what did he say he said I don't
[1:06:07] want to tell you
[1:06:09] what did he say brother Bill
[1:06:12] said it was a judgment sign
[1:06:14] in a few days
[1:06:16] a great earthquake is going to strike
[1:06:18] the West now let now catch this because
[1:06:20] I caught this today for the first time
[1:06:21] as many times I've heard this message
[1:06:23] he says it's going to strike the West in
[1:06:25] meaning Alaska
[1:06:27] he says it's going to strike the west
[1:06:29] and it won't stop
[1:06:33] California Los Angeles will sink it'll
[1:06:36] go down
[1:06:37] she'll slide right into the ocean two
[1:06:39] days after that the Alaskan earthquake
[1:06:41] shook Alaska
[1:06:43] then the last meeting I had in
[1:06:44] California while speaking and didn't
[1:06:46] know nothing happened Billy though I got
[1:06:47] on the street it told California and
[1:06:49] started prophesying over them Capernaum
[1:06:51] Capernaum now brother Branham is not
[1:06:53] saying you're that ancient city which
[1:06:55] was along the seashore and was lost like
[1:06:57] Sodom and Gomorrah but he he he goes
[1:07:00] back and he says there's something
[1:07:01] similar to that Jesus used almost he
[1:07:03] didn't say exact even on the tape he
[1:07:05] says he said almost the same thing in
[1:07:08] the scripture
[1:07:09] and he says he says Capernaum Capernaum
[1:07:12] the city that's called by the name of
[1:07:14] the Angels now God has made a 20th
[1:07:16] century identification said it's the
[1:07:19] city of the Angels that's Los Angeles
[1:07:21] see
[1:07:23] and so he said it's called by the name
[1:07:25] of the Angels that's Los Angeles
[1:07:28] you've exalted yourself into heaven is
[1:07:31] that true
[1:07:33] they've got all their gods all their
[1:07:35] sports stars Hollywood stars movie stars
[1:07:38] all kinds of stars they've exalted
[1:07:40] themselves they they have a they have
[1:07:42] such worship there of the God of this
[1:07:45] evil age
[1:07:46] brother John Andy's made a statement
[1:07:48] that I wrote down in my notes was so
[1:07:50] astonishing he talks about the World
[1:07:52] Wide Web
[1:07:54] and I'm gonna tell you something friends
[1:07:55] you need to have the Holy Ghost these
[1:07:57] days that you live in this is no time to
[1:08:00] be walking around with just an
[1:08:01] intellectual experience you're going to
[1:08:04] need to overcoming power to just
[1:08:07] function and think about that in just
[1:08:10] everyday life I mean it's just a phone
[1:08:14] it's just a computer I'm sorry the
[1:08:16] worlds went this way how do I stay
[1:08:18] connected I'm in a business I got free I
[1:08:21] mean this is how I can't go live as a
[1:08:23] caveman
[1:08:24] and if I get rid of of a mobile phone
[1:08:27] and a computer and the internet I might
[1:08:28] as well be a caveman for because of
[1:08:31] where today is you understand
[1:08:33] the disparity would be so great you'd
[1:08:35] just you'd never know anything
[1:08:37] and people tell you what's wrong with
[1:08:39] you I can't reach you I don't have a
[1:08:40] phone what
[1:08:43] how do you live well how do we live
[1:08:46] before well but that was before
[1:08:47] everybody got them
[1:08:48] now everything operates this way if you
[1:08:50] want to operate you've got no choice I'm
[1:08:52] here to tell you this is the time to
[1:08:54] have church in your home
[1:08:55] that's the time to have parents who are
[1:08:58] full of the spirit this is time for
[1:09:00] teenagers to get the real the real Holy
[1:09:03] Ghost
[1:09:05] we're living in a haunted mansion
[1:09:09] made by Lucifer himself
[1:09:15] says
[1:09:17] exalted yourself in the heaven but
[1:09:19] you'll be brought down to hell for if
[1:09:20] the mighty Works had been done and Sodom
[1:09:23] that had been done in you it would have
[1:09:25] been standing till this day now he says
[1:09:27] he starts talking about the signs of the
[1:09:29] time I'm skipping skipping skipping and
[1:09:31] go listen to it
[1:09:33] you watch
[1:09:36] the water will come the water will come
[1:09:39] plumbed back into the Salton Sea
[1:09:43] Los Angeles is doomed
[1:09:48] it's nearly every Hollywood star you can
[1:09:50] think of
[1:09:53] it's the
[1:09:55] banking Hub entertainment HUB insurance
[1:09:57] hub
[1:09:58] it's our Western
[1:10:00] Seaboard defense it's everything
[1:10:05] he says
[1:10:07] Los Angeles is doomed for judgment I
[1:10:09] tell you before it happens that you
[1:10:10] might know when it does happen brother
[1:10:12] Brown is going to be gone in a month
[1:10:16] I never spoke that by myself and I've
[1:10:18] never had him tell me one thing
[1:10:21] but what happened this is an
[1:10:22] international audience he's not in his
[1:10:23] Tabernacle this is an international
[1:10:25] audience and he's making a pretty bold
[1:10:27] statement I've never had him tell me one
[1:10:29] thing but what happened and you can bear
[1:10:30] record of that and all you can hear in
[1:10:33] this International audience is is amen's
[1:10:36] all across the building ministers on the
[1:10:38] platform
[1:10:40] people can come today say what they want
[1:10:42] but none of his peers they all knew
[1:10:45] no one challenged him on that
[1:10:49] see it's so good to testify I love this
[1:10:52] statement I feel like this tonight
[1:10:55] he says it's so good to testify to real
[1:10:58] listeners
[1:10:59] We Believe oh Lord he says Lord we
[1:11:02] believe help our believer oh don't you
[1:11:04] like being a real listener
[1:11:06] don't you like being a real believer

[1:17:21] haunted mansion but I got a world going
[1:17:23] where there's mansions and not one of
[1:17:26] them are haunted
[1:17:28] there's a house that I'm going to dwell
[1:17:30] in and it's not haunted it's never been

[1:17:54] this is where we are
[1:17:57] this is the land we live in
[1:18:00] this is the age we've come to
[1:18:03] the world
[1:18:04] is transitioning
[1:18:07] it's transitioning friends you young
[1:18:09] people you remember
[1:18:11] brother John talked about
[1:18:13] I said this in a large
[1:18:15] Ministry group that I'm in
[1:18:17] and I put it in there brother John Andes
[1:18:20] had said
[1:18:21] you know
[1:18:23] speaking of transition
[1:18:25] he said you know when God
[1:18:28] took by the Branham home
[1:18:31] that was like a statement
[1:18:33] that was God saying
[1:18:36] now the bride can go on without her
[1:18:40] prophet
[1:18:41] he's finished
[1:18:43] he's wrapped up brought home to his
[1:18:46] reward
[1:18:47] his labors are over
[1:18:51] now the bride can go on because now
[1:18:54] she's going to be a global bride around
[1:18:56] the world assemblies are going to rise
[1:18:58] up in all the darkest jungles of Africa
[1:19:01] and all the most remote places of Asia
[1:19:04] it's going to cover North America and
[1:19:05] Europe it's going to go this thing's
[1:19:07] going global and there's a bride today
[1:19:09] who is standing under the revealed word
[1:19:12] of the hour and she is the name of Jesus
[1:19:15] personified
[1:19:17] is that what you're a part of you see he
[1:19:20] said you know it's like a relay race the
[1:19:22] Baton is handed off and a profit runs
[1:19:25] but finally it's time for the bride to
[1:19:28] run and as he's as he's you know as he's
[1:19:31] reaching his baton back and brother John
[1:19:32] said the problem that a lot of people
[1:19:34] have had is that usually it's in that
[1:19:37] handoff it's in the transition
[1:19:40] where the Baton gets dropped if it's
[1:19:43] going to get dropped nobody really drops
[1:19:44] it running but it's in that transition
[1:19:47] and sometimes we've seen them get
[1:19:49] dropped and and and and then this
[1:19:51] Transit and we're transitioning now
[1:19:54] we're transitioning for home friends
[1:19:57] we've turned the last quarter Hallelujah
[1:20:00] oh I see the bright light shining and I
[1:20:03] don't want to drop the Baton I want to
[1:20:05] make sure I got a firm grip on it I want
[1:20:08] to make sure I'm Marching In the beat of
[1:20:10] the Gospel Hallelujah I'm not looking to
[1:20:13] stay in this haunted house of hell I'm
[1:20:15] looking for a house not made with hands
[1:20:18] [Applause]
[1:20:19] Eternal in the heavens never haunted by
[1:20:22] anything
[1:20:23] oh let's stand to our feet friends this
[1:20:26] is the hour of total freedom this is the
[1:20:28] hour of complete victory
[1:20:30] this is what God
[1:20:32] has allotted for us in this day this day
[1:20:35] that you live in
[1:20:37] is a day
[1:20:38] when a when a bride around the world
[1:20:44] gets changed the dead in Christ rise and
[1:20:48] we are changed in a moment in the
[1:20:51] twinkling of an eye

[1:20:57] I was never so proud to
[1:21:00] be with young men and young women this
[1:21:02] past weekend
[1:21:04] it was so beautiful
[1:21:06] to see so many
[1:21:08] in the prime of their life seeking more
[1:21:11] of God
[1:21:14] seeking a closer walk
[1:21:17] bow your heads with me all over the
[1:21:18] building just whatever you choose
[1:21:20] brother Ken
[1:21:22] with heads bowed all over the building
[1:21:25] now

[1:21:30] that I didn't make any of this up
[1:21:33] tonight
[1:21:34] you know the condition of the world you
[1:21:37] know I'm not wrong
[1:21:39] you know this is a house of hell
[1:21:43] you live here
[1:21:45] you know it as well as I know it
[1:21:48] rampant perversion
[1:21:50] rampant
[1:21:52] horrifying almost Indescribable sin
[1:21:57] and low down living
[1:22:01] the most corrupted
[1:22:03] agenda
[1:22:07] not only political but religious and
[1:22:11] Society
[1:22:13] with the wheels coming off
[1:22:16] you know I'm not wrong friends
[1:22:18] you walk these streets just like me
[1:22:22] you read these quotes just like me you
[1:22:24] hear Brother Branham tell about these
[1:22:25] things and when he was telling it there
[1:22:27] was still some semblance of godliness in
[1:22:29] the world
[1:22:31] you know what it has stooped to over
[1:22:35] these last 60 or so years
[1:22:38] it has become
[1:22:40] what was only a very short time ago
[1:22:44] unimaginably bad
[1:22:47] we all knew it was Sodom we all knew it
[1:22:49] was Kamar we all knew the days of Noah
[1:22:51] oh yes married and given in marriage and
[1:22:53] and and and perverted yeah we knew that
[1:22:55] but somehow I I at least I I know it's
[1:22:59] not just me I know it's all of us we
[1:23:01] would have never dreamed
[1:23:03] that the world could get to the place
[1:23:05] and I'm here to tell you something it's
[1:23:06] not finished getting bad
[1:23:08] foreign
[1:23:09] it's getting worse

[1:23:20] hope you're doing one of the two
[1:23:22] I hope there's a church in your home
[1:23:26] if Spurgeon knew that under the man age
[1:23:29] under the age of sanctification
[1:23:32] when the whole world was mostly Godly
[1:23:35] and Spurgeon knew then that everybody
[1:23:37] better have a home a church in their
[1:23:39] home where there's active worship and
[1:23:42] active distribution of the word of God
[1:23:45] and a Heavenly order set to things what
[1:23:48] is it now
