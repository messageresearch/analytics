[29:59] one person but you know for for all of
[30:01] us the Lord is doing a thousand things
[30:04] and even a thousand things that we don't

[30:14] amen so I want to speak on the subject
[30:18] the fullness of him that feels all in
[30:20] all
[30:21] and I was just praying and studying this
[30:23] afternoon waiting on the Lord
[30:25] for Clarity on what subject to speak on
[30:27] I think sometimes I come into it and I
[30:30] know you know this is exactly what the
[30:33] Lord wants me to speak on other times
[30:35] you come and you just sit and you you
[30:37] wait and you wait and you wait and you

[30:51] was it like uh what are you thankful for
[30:54] in this day and age
[30:57] amen what makes what makes you excited
[30:58] what grounds you okay I'll talk about
[31:01] that
[31:02] so
[31:03] you know you think about the different
[31:06] situations that
[31:08] you know you have in Ministry Brother
[31:11] Brad knows this the different ones that
[31:13] minister is you're putting your trust in
[31:15] the Lord
[31:16] you don't know what's going on in
[31:19] people's lives and I you know you're
[31:20] always praying that the Lord would give
[31:22] you insight and help you to know and
[31:24] sometimes you come to this pulpit and
[31:25] you have notes that you've had for a
[31:27] long time and you've preached overseas
[31:29] in this country in this country and you
[31:31] say well Lord
[31:32] take it and use it and you think I got
[31:35] nothing and I feel nothing about this
[31:37] I'm just going forward and all of a
[31:39] sudden the text messages come in you the
[31:41] Lord did this the Lord did this this
[31:43] opened up for me this was revealed to me
[31:45] well it shows it's not the person
[31:47] doing the work it's it's the Lord Jesus
[31:50] Christ working for his his church and
[31:53] for his people and if you come with
[31:54] expectations yeah you get what you
[31:56] expect
[31:58] amen so let's look at the scripture
[32:01] Revelation chapter 3
[32:05] and verse 19 through 21
[32:16] as many as I love
[32:18] I rebuke and chasten be zealous
[32:20] therefore and repent
[32:22] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[32:26] any man hear my voice and open the door
[32:28] I will come into him and we'll sup with
[32:31] him and he with me
[32:33] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[32:35] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[32:37] overcame and am set down with my father
[32:40] in his throne amen may the Lord add the
[32:42] blessing to the reading of his word he
[32:43] can be seated
[32:48] just want to say to everyone thank you
[32:51] so much for your
[32:52] prayers and for standing with us during
[32:55] the difficult time that we've had as a
[32:58] family of losing my mother
[33:00] and I always say that losing my mother
[33:02] and then I catch myself I didn't lose
[33:03] her I know exactly where she's at
[33:07] know just where she's at and I know what
[33:10] just what she's experiencing and feeling
[33:12] only it's a lot better than what I'm
[33:14] even imagining so
[33:16] um so thankful for for standing with us
[33:18] through that through that time
[33:20] appreciate each one of you praying for
[33:22] us and continue to pray for my dad by
[33:26] God's grace he's doing well and the Lord
[33:28] is with him so just remember him uh in
[33:32] your prayers
[33:33] so
[33:34] the fullness of him that fills all in
[33:38] all amen that is from Ephesians we're
[33:41] going to read that later that's where I
[33:43] drew my title from
[33:45] um but we started with revelation 3.
[33:48] and and what brings that on my heart is
[33:51] we have
[33:52] we have a present Christ a present tense
[33:56] Christ in Revelation 3 20. he says I
[34:00] stand at the door and not he's there in
[34:04] the midst of the candlesticks right
[34:06] he's always there through all seven ages
[34:08] but in the seventh age he comes
[34:11] personally
[34:12] in spirit form to his church
[34:16] to the bride he's calling a bride this
[34:19] is part of him calling a bride he's
[34:20] standing at the door and knocking so
[34:23] what does that show us it shows us he's
[34:24] outside
[34:26] of this church
[34:29] and it's it's even worse than that is
[34:31] they've kicked him on the outside
[34:34] they believe they're right they believe
[34:36] that they're the church they're rich and
[34:38] increased in goods and they don't know
[34:41] their naked miserable wretched
[34:45] you know that's the condition
[34:47] of the church in our day laodicea
[34:49] people's rights I mean my land's sakes
[34:53] is it people's rights in today's day and
[34:56] age they make they make up so many
[34:57] rights you don't even
[34:59] can't even keep track of it and they're
[35:02] new and there ain't rights in the first
[35:03] place
[35:06] and
[35:08] my goodness it's it's uh
[35:11] you almost can't even speak about what's
[35:13] happening in our age it's so filthy it's
[35:16] so disgusting and so perverted it's in
[35:19] our hopeless we didn't just get kicked
[35:21] off
[35:22] YouTube but oh well
[35:24] this transgender
[35:26] nonsense it's complete garbage there's
[35:29] no such a thing as transgender
[35:32] and they're pushing this in the schools
[35:34] and they're grooming and they're doing
[35:35] stripteases of men dressed up as women
[35:38] in front of little
[35:39] uh little children and they're grooming
[35:42] them for homosexuality and pedophilia
[35:45] and perversion
[35:48] and these are their rights to do that
[35:51] it's not not a right forgiven by God
[35:55] might be given by our government but
[35:57] that shows our governments of the devil
[36:01] and you know that's the filth of the
[36:04] whole thing that's not even the church
[36:06] though you see even a movement inside
[36:08] the charismatic church is starting to
[36:11] try to say well we accept everyone we're
[36:13] open to everyone
[36:14] homosexuality is okay and we can't you
[36:17] know we can't best base our faith on the
[36:21] Bible the Bible's unreliable
[36:24] you know that's the Andy Stanley over
[36:26] mega church in in Atlanta
[36:28] saying we don't base our faith on the
[36:30] Bible we base it on the resurrection
[36:32] well
[36:34] Brother Andy
[36:36] where do we get in a reliable account
[36:40] of the Resurrection
[36:42] in the Bible
[36:44] that's where we get that's where we get
[36:46] it so you have without the Bible you
[36:48] have no Resurrection you have no God you
[36:50] have
[36:51] you have no you have nothing
[36:56] you know and then then you have
[36:57] Pentecostals and charismatics and you
[37:00] know many many people with good hearts
[37:02] and good people yeah
[37:04] lovely people but they're caught up in
[37:07] prosperity and you see
[37:09] in the very best of them are the likes
[37:11] of Joel Osteen who doesn't really even
[37:13] preach the gospel
[37:14] doesn't preach repentance the the Jesus
[37:17] that the the
[37:19] modern church is preaching us some are
[37:21] preaching this but as many of them are
[37:24] not preaching the one that says as many
[37:26] as I love I rebuke and chasten
[37:29] you know you see people saying well I'm
[37:32] welcoming and loving everyone certainly
[37:35] but what is love
[37:38] what is love Jesus says I love you so
[37:42] I'm going to rebuke you and chasten you
[37:43] if you're wrong you're going to get a
[37:45] rebuke if he loves you
[37:47] and you're wrong you're going to get a
[37:49] rebuke and you're going to say Thank You
[37:52] Lord is that why we come to church
[37:53] judgment starts at the house of God
[37:56] we want to be encouraged
[37:58] but if that's all that's happening is
[38:00] encourage encourage and there's no
[38:02] conviction the word isn't being preached
[38:04] there's not a balance
[38:06] there has to be convicting things spoken
[38:09] over the pulpit otherwise we are an
[38:12] audit balance people
[38:15] what's the Zeal of the age
[38:17] to say I'm right and I accept everybody
[38:21] I give in to people's all people's
[38:23] rights
[38:25] it's repentance
[38:27] there's an absolute
[38:29] that absolute is being delivered to us
[38:31] we hear it
[38:34] and we say oh I've been waiting for this
[38:38] thank you Lord Jesus this is what I this
[38:41] is my this is this hurts but this is the
[38:43] desire of my heart because I want to be
[38:45] right with your word
[38:48] amen and so you know you again in the
[38:51] Pentecostals charismatics they get they
[38:53] have that or they have the word faith
[38:54] people with Kenneth Copeland who's so
[38:56] focused on money and prosperity they've
[38:58] almost corrupted everything they stand
[39:00] for and it's it's almost disgusting
[39:03] to see the version of
[39:06] you know the power of God that they
[39:08] believe in it's very
[39:10] strange and no doubt miracles happen and
[39:12] and there is good things that are done
[39:15] there but at the same time it's a great
[39:19] falling away from the word
[39:22] then you see people who are even they're
[39:24] preaching many truths of the gospel and
[39:26] they're preaching about predestination
[39:27] and the authority of the word of God and
[39:29] you listen to him on the radio and you
[39:30] say my or you see the memes or the
[39:32] different things that they say it
[39:33] there's really good things from Paul
[39:35] Washer John McArthur R.C Sproul but dig
[39:38] down each one of them denies that the
[39:41] gifts of the Spirit are in operation and
[39:43] the Supernatural is in effect in the
[39:46] church in every age each one of them
[39:48] and so where can you go to find a
[39:52] balanced message what denomination what
[39:54] group you can't
[39:56] it's all walked away from the word good
[39:59] people
[40:02] nice people but we're not following nice
[40:04] people we're not trying to be just nice
[40:07] people we're trying to be word people
[40:09] we're trying to be transformed by the
[40:11] renewing of our mind it's what the word
[40:14] preaches that we seek to conform
[40:16] ourselves to not the world
[40:18] we don't come to church to try to preach
[40:21] a message that really you know the
[40:24] unbelievers could Pat us on the back for
[40:27] that's many churches that's what they're
[40:30] they're catering the message to
[40:31] unbelievers
[40:33] and the churches are emptying out
[40:36] because they want to find the word
[40:37] somewhere but they can't
[40:44] and where is that desire for the truth
[40:48] where is that passion for being right
[40:51] with God
[40:52] they want God to be right with them
[40:56] he stands at the door and knocks you
[40:59] hear my voice
[41:00] I'm calling
[41:02] that's not you
[41:04] that's not God
[41:06] surely God would agree with my theology
[41:09] surely God would agree with my Doctrine
[41:13] he's still he's calling hello
[41:16] will anyone hear my voice individuals
[41:18] hear his voice
[41:21] to him that I overcomes
[41:25] there's a reward he that has it here let
[41:27] him hear
[41:29] what the spirit saith to the church is
[41:31] what is overcoming power he that has it
[41:33] here let him hear what the spirit is
[41:36] saying to the church is if you truly
[41:37] hear by spiritual Revelation it will
[41:40] produce an overcoming life
[41:45] that overcoming is a a heart of
[41:48] repentance and getting right with God
[41:50] that Spirit of this age is crept into
[41:53] this message
[41:56] and we want to make it just let's smooth
[41:59] some of these things out a little bit
[42:01] well you know a little bit of this is
[42:04] okay A little bit of that no we're
[42:07] trying to we're trying to compromise
[42:09] to make our Spirits feel better in the
[42:11] age that we live in
[42:13] let's be careful that could that hello
[42:16] that hits home
[42:18] right here
[42:22] it's not about smoothing the message
[42:24] over it's not smoothing things over for
[42:27] ourselves so that we can feel better
[42:29] about where we stand in the message it's
[42:31] standing with the message
[42:33] standing with the truth
[42:36] we have such a
[42:38] feminist perverted Spirit going forth in
[42:42] this age and it wants to get on the
[42:44] message wants to get around the message
[42:46] and that will rise up
[42:50] that will rise up and it brings a
[42:52] perversion
[42:58] I mean if I started listing off the
[43:00] things that brother Brandon said right
[43:02] now I I don't need to beside the point
[43:04] you know what I'm saying if I started
[43:07] lifting it off man I mean it's like
[43:10] hey these guys are insane totally insane
[43:12] no we're perfectly sane
[43:15] these are the right things these are the
[43:18] right and true things
[43:19] that the prophet brought to us
[43:21] it sounds crazy to a perverted age
[43:26] but to the bride of Christ it's it's the
[43:28] truth that we rejoice in
[43:32] shave back what the devil
[43:34] has tried to push over on you
[43:37] push him back
[43:39] in the very practical things in your
[43:41] life
[43:42] the very basic things ABCs of the
[43:45] message the devil is attacking that
[43:47] don't kid yourself he's attacking
[43:50] modesties attacking not wearing makeup
[43:53] he's attacking not cutting the hair he's
[43:55] attacking
[43:57] the basic things of modesty for men and
[43:59] women
[44:00] he's doing it and we're letting him
[44:05] not all of us
[44:10] but in some ways all of us and we've got
[44:12] to push back
[44:14] we want to put the devil under our foot
[44:16] well that those are the things that
[44:17] you're going to put the devil under your
[44:18] foot on
[44:19] right it's not just talking about it
[44:22] it's doing it
[44:23] by putting the word into practice in
[44:25] your life
[44:27] not just saying I believe the message
[44:29] devil believes it too
[44:31] yeah it's lit it's bringing the message
[44:33] and saying Lord I know I'm not right
[44:35] correct me convict me and give me
[44:37] strength to come and Conformity to this
[44:39] message
[44:42] Hebrews 1 1 if you want to control the
[44:45] PowerPoint for me I'm just going to read
[44:46] and you you follow along
[44:50] God who at sundry times and in diverse
[44:52] manners spake in time past unto the
[44:55] fathers by the prophets
[44:58] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[45:00] by his son whom he is appointed heir of
[45:04] All Things by whom also he made the
[45:06] worlds
[45:07] who being the brightness of his glory
[45:10] and the express image of his person and
[45:13] upholding All Things by the word of his
[45:15] power when he had by himself purged our
[45:18] sins sat down on the right hand of the
[45:21] Majesty on high and then the next verse
[45:23] is Hebrews 2.
[45:26] verses three and four how shall we
[45:28] escape if we need so great Ovation which
[45:31] at the first began to be spoken by the
[45:33] Lord and was confirmed unto us by them
[45:34] that heard him
[45:36] God also bearing them witness both with
[45:38] signs and wonders and with diverse
[45:41] Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost
[45:44] according to his will
[45:48] amen so let's look at the pattern that
[45:51] comes
[45:51] Through the Ages God speaks to the
[45:54] fathers to to the Jewish ancestors
[45:57] in the prophets you know it says says by
[46:00] the prophets it literally means in the
[46:03] prophets God veiled himself in those
[46:06] prophets you want to go back brother
[46:09] Caleb to to a couple screens to verse 1
[46:13] 1.
[46:15] so God veiled himself in the prophets
[46:18] and spoke through those prophets to the
[46:21] Jewish ancestors all right then he says
[46:24] hath in these last days spoken to us
[46:26] same thing in
[46:29] his son
[46:31] so God veiled himself through the
[46:33] prophets they were a part of the word
[46:35] then he avails himself through his son
[46:37] he's the fullness of the word
[46:40] and the Sun is more than a prophet
[46:43] because he appointed this son heir of
[46:46] all things and through him or in the sun
[46:51] he also made the worlds the word worlds
[46:55] there is the Aeons it could it could be
[46:58] speaking of he is appointed or designed
[47:02] the ages in the Sun or through the Sun
[47:07] and he goes even further he's even more
[47:10] than that he is the brightness of God's
[47:13] glory in other words easy if you have
[47:15] the son and then you have the Rays
[47:17] shining out from the Sun so this that
[47:20] English is a horrible language to tell
[47:22] this in if I wish I knew Spanish I could
[47:24] tell it to you and but
[47:26] sun and Sun you know right what I'm
[47:30] saying the Sun
[47:34] it works better in other languages but
[47:37] not for translators I'll tell you that
[47:39] much they're looking at me like
[47:44] so the son of God
[47:46] is the brightness he's the outring he's
[47:48] the he is the sunlight shining forth
[47:51] from the source which is the Father the
[47:54] great eternal
[47:57] and he is the express image of his
[47:59] person it literally means he's the exact
[48:01] imprint of God's nature
[48:04] and even further he's so much higher
[48:07] than the than the prophets he upholds
[48:10] all things by the word of his power
[48:14] and we had by himself purged our sins
[48:16] even more than the prophets he sat down
[48:19] on the right hand of the Majesty on high
[48:22] all right so we see there God spoke to
[48:25] the fathers and the prophets he spoke to
[48:27] us in the son the son is so far beyond
[48:30] the prophet sees the he's the outring of
[48:33] God's glory the exact imprint of a
[48:34] substance he's the heir of everything
[48:39] and next we see in the next uh yeah you
[48:43] got it up perfect salvation is purchased
[48:46] by the Sun and then it's proclaimed
[48:48] by Witnesses but not just proclaimed it
[48:51] shows us that God Bears witness with it
[48:54] with signs and wonders the supernatural
[48:58] oh always follows the word when the word
[49:02] is proclaimed the power of God comes
[49:04] forth and testifies to the fact this is
[49:08] God moving through this word
[49:12] now many take these verses uh it's
[49:14] astounding they take these verses in
[49:16] Hebrews especially chapter one and they
[49:19] say now we don't have any Prophets
[49:22] no such thing as prophets under the New
[49:23] Testament we have the Holy Ghost we
[49:26] don't need men of God to speak to us
[49:28] because the holy ghost is now our
[49:30] teacher
[49:32] well the book of Acts book of Ephesians
[49:35] Romans First Corinthians speak
[49:38] differently than that yeah it speaks of
[49:41] the gift of Prophecy it also speaks of
[49:43] prophets
[49:44] speaks of Apostles and even people say
[49:47] well Apostles is limited to Paul and the
[49:50] the the the eleven no
[49:53] the many other people Paul himself calls
[49:56] apostles
[50:00] and so
[50:03] we we see this clearly he speaks through
[50:09] they say well that that's where they go
[50:10] is in in Hebrews one he spoke in Us in
[50:13] his last days in his son so he's
[50:15] speaking to us through Jesus Christ
[50:18] so we don't need prophets we don't need
[50:20] Apostles what in the world
[50:23] kind of crazy thought thought is that
[50:27] the very time that this person is
[50:29] writing it
[50:31] he spoke to us in the last days in the
[50:34] sun is Apostles are proclaiming the
[50:37] message and the this this writer is
[50:40] saying God's doing Miracles now
[50:43] he's doing Supernatural things now
[50:47] to Bear witness of this message that
[50:50] he's re he's not dead he's resurrected
[50:52] he's alive
[50:55] all right next next screen
[50:58] it wasn't so from the beginning
[51:01] brother Branham says this now we take
[51:03] our Lord
[51:04] when he was here he did not claim to do
[51:06] Miracles he said it was the father God
[51:08] that dwelt in him and he was he
[51:11] expressed God through himself God and
[51:13] otherwise built himself a body that he
[51:16] lived in himself God came down was
[51:19] manifest In the Flesh in Christ and it
[51:21] was not Jesus the body the Son of God it
[51:23] was the god of Glory in the Son of God
[51:26] showing the glory of God you see through
[51:28] himself the god of Glory manifesting the
[51:30] glory of God Amen and in him God dwelt
[51:34] in him and he reflected God
[51:36] now that's the way each of we ministers
[51:39] do we reflect God as God is in us and
[51:43] then that's the only way that God can
[51:44] move
[51:45] is and people can see God is through we
[51:48] his servants that's how people won't
[51:51] read a Bible but they'll read you see
[51:53] and so you reflect Christ your walks
[51:56] your talks your actions all reflect
[51:58] Christ that's the perfectly expressing
[52:02] Hebrews one and two
[52:05] God revealed in the form of this
[52:08] Prophets The Holy Ghost speaks through
[52:09] the prophets right I mean that that's
[52:11] what uh second Peter tells us
[52:18] God revealed perfectly and completely
[52:20] and fully in his son to accomplish
[52:24] Redemption what is it the holy ghost
[52:26] manifested in the fullness in the Sun
[52:30] then it's Christ proclaimed through his
[52:32] witness what Christ in you the hope of
[52:35] glory the Holy Ghost
[52:38] through the fivefold ministry and the
[52:40] body of believers
[52:42] that's God's purpose that's what God's
[52:44] doing and it always consists of
[52:46] Supernatural any time the word is
[52:49] preached anywhere anyplace God will
[52:52] follow with signs
[52:55] to Bear record of that that's through
[52:57] all ages all seven Church ages
[53:00] it's never different there's no such
[53:02] thing as ceasing of the gifts or
[53:04] cessation of the gifts that's a false
[53:07] Doctrine invented by dispensationalists
[53:11] because they they couldn't produce the
[53:13] supernatural in their Ministry
[53:16] amen
[53:20] sure they had some good things to say
[53:21] and brother Branham even Bears witness
[53:23] of some of the things that
[53:24] dispensationalists teach about but that
[53:26] was one of the worst scourges they
[53:28] brought on the 20th and 21st century
[53:33] Ephesians chapter one
[53:36] verse 22 and 23. this is God's purpose
[53:39] this is during the first church age Paul
[53:41] writing
[53:43] it's not just the last Church age it's
[53:45] the first church age and it's put all
[53:47] things under his feet and gave him to be
[53:50] the head over all things to the church
[53:51] verse 23 which is his body the fullness
[53:55] of him that filleth all in all who is
[53:58] the fullness of him that fills all in
[53:59] all the bride
[54:01] the bride is to be the fullness
[54:04] manifested Paul delivered his message
[54:07] they had the full word
[54:11] but the church fell away from that
[54:15] now the church through the church ages
[54:17] they had it in part
[54:19] but in Malachi 4 were promised and we've
[54:21] received that promise
[54:23] to be restored back to the fullness of
[54:26] the word
[54:28] now this this scripture that's written
[54:31] in Ephesians 1 23 and was fulfilled in
[54:33] the first church age were restored back
[54:35] to that we are to be the fullness of him
[54:38] that filleth all in all
[54:40] now God is a spirit
[54:44] right God is invisible he can't be seen
[54:47] with the naked eye
[54:48] he hasn't been seen he never will be
[54:50] seen
[54:52] he covers all space and time
[54:56] so we're not
[54:59] we're not filled
[55:01] with his whole Spirit right he he exists
[55:04] apart from and separate from us
[55:08] but that's not what fullness is really
[55:11] speaking about that's speaking of the
[55:13] manifestation of his attributes
[55:17] the fullness of the godhead bodily was
[55:19] Jesus yet Jesus himself when he's
[55:21] praying he lifts his eyes up to Heaven's
[55:23] father The Hours come well
[55:27] couldn't he just looked in a mirror well
[55:29] I suppose he could have but he did look
[55:31] up
[55:32] and so God covers all space and time but
[55:35] the fullness of the attributes
[55:38] were manifested in Christ
[55:41] the fullness of the attributes what
[55:44] Christ purchased for us is so that the
[55:46] fullness of those attributes could be
[55:48] manifested in a body of Believers not
[55:50] you as an individual but the whole body
[55:53] yeah it's that fullness is to be
[55:55] manifested
[55:57] and that was lost
[55:59] that was lost
[56:01] to the ages
[56:02] as the church fellow if you fall away
[56:04] from the word what are you doing you're
[56:07] falling away from the fullness
[56:09] and so that's why there had to be a
[56:11] restoration in the seventh Church age
[56:14] it's not a restoration of mere Doctrine
[56:17] it's a restoration of the Life of Christ
[56:20] in a body of Believers amen
[56:28] next screen
[56:31] and sirs we would see Jesus
[56:35] says God knowing the end from the
[56:37] beginning
[56:38] therefore he had lauded to his world a
[56:41] certain part of the word for each
[56:43] generation as they come along
[56:44] he sent prophets in the Old Testament
[56:47] we are taught in Hebrews one God in
[56:49] Sundry times and diverse manners speak
[56:51] to the fathers to the prophets in this
[56:53] last day through his son Christ Jesus
[56:56] now if we'll examine that scripture real
[56:58] well when Jesus was on Earth and he said
[57:02] he was the son of God they condemned him
[57:06] he said why would you condemn me when I
[57:08] say I'm the Son of God when you call
[57:10] those who the word came to gods
[57:14] Abraham was considered a god Elijah was
[57:16] considered a god Isaiah was a God
[57:18] because the word of God came to them
[57:21] and they were in portion Gods Jesus said
[57:24] they were he said you call them Gods now
[57:26] you see when the man was anointed like
[57:28] Joseph he portrayed Christ
[57:31] when Moses was anointed he portrayed
[57:33] Christ
[57:34] when David was anointed he portrayed
[57:36] Christ
[57:37] all leading up to Christ and he was the
[57:41] fullness of the word
[57:43] the word was made manifest in him
[57:46] he was the complete anointed one
[57:48] they had it by portions we as
[57:51] individuals I'm adding that part as
[57:54] individuals we have it by portions
[57:57] he was the anointed one the entire plan
[58:00] of God laid in him amen
[58:04] God's plan before the foundation of the
[58:06] world to redeem a lost world was in him
[58:08] he was the word and he still he is still
[58:11] the word the same yesterday today and
[58:13] forever remember he came to the fathers
[58:15] through the prophets made himself known
[58:17] through the prophets and then in this
[58:18] this last day through his son Christ
[58:21] Jesus he was God made manifest notice
[58:26] the word always comes to the prophet God
[58:28] never did work through a group of people
[58:32] it's an individual he works through he
[58:34] worked in the days of Noah through Noah
[58:36] he worked in the days of Moses through
[58:38] Moses worked in the Days of Elijah
[58:39] through Elijah through Elijah and Elijah
[58:42] through Isaiah and those prophets as
[58:44] they come down through the age now I'm
[58:47] going to pause there for a minute people
[58:48] will take that and they'll study out the
[58:50] Old Testament and say there was two
[58:52] prophets at one time so brother Branham
[58:54] is a liar what are you talking about
[58:56] you're missing the important entirely
[58:58] you never listen to what he said what is
[59:01] he saying God works through one prophet
[59:04] he didn't say he couldn't work through
[59:06] two prophets at the same time I mean
[59:07] what do you think is going on what do
[59:09] you think has gone on Through the Ages
[59:12] no that's not saying there has to be
[59:14] only one man you can go through the
[59:17] scriptures God's program he works
[59:19] through one individual to reveal his
[59:22] word now you come to the church ages yes
[59:24] it's one individual that the word of the
[59:27] Lord comes to there's many men anointed
[59:29] to preach that same word
[59:30] just like there is in this age but
[59:33] there's one man who receives a specific
[59:35] message to bring to specific people but
[59:38] secondarily people that say well brother
[59:39] Brandon made a mistake do you not know
[59:41] that there's two Nations that God was
[59:43] dealing with
[59:46] there was Judah
[59:48] and there was Israel
[59:50] so some of those prophets were sent to
[59:52] Judah at the very same time another
[59:54] Prophet was sent to Israel
[59:57] so yes there's two prophets at the same
[59:59] time but God didn't work through them as
[1:00:01] a committee
[1:00:03] he didn't call him together and say hey
[1:00:04] let's agree on it what's the point of
[1:00:06] what brother Brandon's saying is he's
[1:00:08] trying to show you God does not work
[1:00:10] through the Nicene Council God doesn't
[1:00:13] work through the Assemblies of God
[1:00:16] Elders at their headquarters or the UPC
[1:00:19] elders and president at their
[1:00:22] headquarters that's not how God works he
[1:00:25] anoints a man he sends them he preaches
[1:00:27] the message and he goes off the scene
[1:00:29] and it's up to the people whether they
[1:00:31] receive it or not
[1:00:33] and God will judge the people by that
[1:00:35] word that's delivered
[1:00:40] continue and then when he was here he
[1:00:43] was manifested fully
[1:00:45] not in Pharisees Sadducees but in Jesus
[1:00:48] Christ he was the word
[1:00:50] that's why he could say what he said
[1:00:52] that's the statements that he could make
[1:00:54] now these Greeks knew of this sea
[1:00:56] through each age God has allotted so
[1:00:58] much word and the churches get it all
[1:01:00] confused up then he sends a prophet
[1:01:02] among them and vindicates that word it's
[1:01:04] just like any other time
[1:01:06] we speak today and say the Methodist
[1:01:07] Lutheran said well when you believe
[1:01:09] that's all you have to do you're
[1:01:10] justified by faith believe many said
[1:01:12] they believed and didn't have it we know
[1:01:14] that long come Wesley with what with
[1:01:17] what called second work of Grace
[1:01:19] sanctification all that shouts and are
[1:01:21] Sanctified has got it many shouted
[1:01:23] didn't have it long came the Pentecost
[1:01:25] said all that speaks with tongues has
[1:01:27] got it many spoke with tongues and
[1:01:29] didn't have it
[1:01:32] so again we we have God allotting his
[1:01:37] word
[1:01:38] to each age to each time period to each
[1:01:41] people
[1:01:42] you know the word that God is go is
[1:01:45] revealed to us
[1:01:46] is not the same word that was revealed
[1:01:49] through Luther it's a building thing the
[1:01:53] word that was revealed to Moses is not
[1:01:55] the same word that was revealed to Noah
[1:01:58] God that's what he's saying there's a
[1:02:00] allotted word for each day now you go
[1:02:03] through the prophets all the prophets
[1:02:04] the purpose of their Ministry was to
[1:02:07] prop foretell the coming of Christ also
[1:02:10] was to call the call them all the
[1:02:12] repentance and say return back to what
[1:02:14] Moses taught
[1:02:16] walk in obedience to the law
[1:02:19] right that's that's the Old Testament
[1:02:21] prophets now you're gonna you get John
[1:02:24] the Baptist comes and says Christ is
[1:02:26] coming
[1:02:27] then you get the apostles prophets
[1:02:29] evangelists pastors and teachers and
[1:02:30] they're pointing back and saying Christ
[1:02:32] came
[1:02:33] right then the church starts falling
[1:02:36] away so what do you think message God is
[1:02:38] going to send
[1:02:40] to us return back to the word
[1:02:44] he sends
[1:02:46] a man in the spirit and power of Elijah
[1:02:48] what did Elijah do
[1:02:50] he says repent and return back to
[1:02:52] Jehovah God you turned away from him
[1:02:54] you're not walking with him you're not
[1:02:56] worshiping him right you're not obeying
[1:02:58] him what do you think the spirit of
[1:02:59] Elijah is going to do again in this hour
[1:03:03] same thing
[1:03:05] you say brother Brandon made mistakes
[1:03:09] have you read the Bible
[1:03:12] which prophet didn't make a mistake
[1:03:14] Jesus Christ
[1:03:16] that's why he's the Savior and the
[1:03:18] Redeemer he's perfect he never sinned
[1:03:20] he's the heir of all things he's sitting
[1:03:23] at the right hand of the Majesty on high
[1:03:24] none of the other prophets are doing
[1:03:26] that not brother Branham nobody
[1:03:28] why because they're Sinners saved by
[1:03:31] God's grace they make mistakes you say
[1:03:34] brother Anna made mistakes you are
[1:03:35] correct
[1:03:37] you you understand now
[1:03:39] but
[1:03:40] but
[1:03:42] this was a Vindicated prophet just as
[1:03:45] Isaiah who made mistakes
[1:03:47] Elijah who made mistakes Elisha who made
[1:03:50] mistakes
[1:03:52] all of these men that's the story of the
[1:03:54] Bible
[1:03:55] God working through Earthen vessels
[1:03:59] we have this treasure in Earthen vessels
[1:04:03] he didn't say perfect vessels
[1:04:05] he didn't say golden vessels some of you
[1:04:08] might be you think your spouse is a
[1:04:10] golden vessel but they're Earth and
[1:04:11] vessels
[1:04:14] or you might think you're a golden
[1:04:15] vessel
[1:04:17] but you're not you're an earth and
[1:04:19] vessel just like all the rest of the
[1:04:21] prophets the Apostle Paul was not
[1:04:23] perfect
[1:04:24] he made mistakes but the word of the
[1:04:27] Lord came to the Apostle Paul
[1:04:30] and God used him as a pat used him as a
[1:04:32] pattern
[1:04:35] imperfect people
[1:04:37] pointing us to a perfect word
[1:04:45] I just wonder what people think was
[1:04:47] happening
[1:04:48] in brother branham's life when they say
[1:04:51] he made mistakes what was all that what
[1:04:53] was all that Supernatural that was
[1:04:55] taking place oh no Supernatural is
[1:04:57] taking place you are a lunatic
[1:05:01] if you think that no Supernatural is
[1:05:03] taking place in the life of William
[1:05:04] Branham you are certifiable you need to
[1:05:06] be checked into somewhere
[1:05:09] sure amen
[1:05:11] what was happening you answer that
[1:05:14] brother Branham said that in his
[1:05:15] meetings it will depend on what you
[1:05:19] what source you think this is coming
[1:05:21] from some people think it's from the
[1:05:23] Devil
[1:05:23] some people think that's God
[1:05:26] everybody in that meeting knew something
[1:05:27] was happening none of them said it
[1:05:30] didn't happen
[1:05:31] they said something happened well it
[1:05:33] depends on who you think the source is
[1:05:36] then that'll be where your reward is
[1:05:38] from isn't that what brother Branham
[1:05:40] said
[1:05:41] it'll your reward will be from hell
[1:05:44] or it'll be from heaven
[1:05:48] receive a prophet in the name of the
[1:05:50] Prophet you'll receive a prophet's
[1:05:51] reward
[1:05:57] we're not following cunningly devised
[1:06:00] fables not something done in a corner
[1:06:04] we're not saying hey let's go out to the
[1:06:06] desert somewhere into some secret place
[1:06:08] and find it this was done around the
[1:06:10] world it was Vindicated proven time and
[1:06:14] time and time again
[1:06:17] and we're not a cult we're not
[1:06:19] interested in following a man we're
[1:06:21] simply saying
[1:06:23] God did something incredible here
[1:06:26] he used a man from Kentucky named
[1:06:28] William Branham we submit to what God
[1:06:30] has sent you know it you could you could
[1:06:33] be proud of yourself and say hey I I
[1:06:35] have a higher degree than brother
[1:06:37] Branham I do and I had to say lay that
[1:06:40] aside
[1:06:41] God is moving God is doing something
[1:06:43] here that I can't explain
[1:06:46] with human reasoning
[1:06:50] it has to be but it has to be a
[1:06:51] revelation to you personally is God
[1:06:54] leading your life that's why I've said
[1:06:56] to people time and time again when they
[1:06:58] say there's mistakes and brother Branham
[1:07:00] did this and over here he did this I
[1:07:02] just say wait a minute okay you're going
[1:07:04] we're not to lean to our own
[1:07:06] understanding as Christians I don't care
[1:07:09] what you believe but you know as a
[1:07:11] Christian if you believe the Bible you
[1:07:13] know you're not supposed to lean towards
[1:07:14] reason
[1:07:15] so are you praying did you pray about
[1:07:18] this line of reasoning this line of
[1:07:21] thought did you seek the Lord is the
[1:07:23] Lord guiding you in this
[1:07:25] that's the question to ask yourself if
[1:07:27] you're having a if you're having doubts
[1:07:29] or struggles with the message is the
[1:07:31] holy spirit leading you in this struggle
[1:07:33] and doubt
[1:07:36] ask yourself that question I think
[1:07:38] that's important that's good I think
[1:07:40] that's biblical Christian advice we go
[1:07:43] we use come brother bear says come with
[1:07:46] a sameness
[1:07:49] I'm not asking you to follow Omens
[1:07:52] signs in the skies we come with the
[1:07:55] scripture
[1:07:56] I mean I don't know about you but when I
[1:07:58] heard about the message
[1:08:01] I I went after my Bible
[1:08:04] like crazy
[1:08:06] what's this now I mean I was asking my
[1:08:09] now father-in-law so many questions that
[1:08:11] drove him crazy
[1:08:12] and asking my friend the same and and
[1:08:15] we're searching things out and going by
[1:08:16] scripture and
[1:08:19] but then a long God came because I was
[1:08:22] praying Lord what is this I don't want
[1:08:24] to follow a cult I don't want to follow
[1:08:26] some nonsense I only I want to follow
[1:08:29] your word this is what I want to live by
[1:08:31] that's my desire not some cult not some
[1:08:34] Fanatics I want to follow your word
[1:08:38] and as I was praying
[1:08:40] a mighty rushing wind came in my room
[1:08:44] I was laying there and my my door was
[1:08:47] almost shut and I was praying Lord
[1:08:48] reveal yourself to me make this clear
[1:08:50] help me to understand
[1:08:52] as I was on my knees
[1:08:54] I could I I heard a
[1:08:58] H come into my
[1:08:59] bedroom
[1:09:00] 21 years old look over at my window
[1:09:03] think what is that my left muscle left
[1:09:06] my window open no it was completely
[1:09:08] still the curtains and everything
[1:09:10] and then I felt something come across my
[1:09:12] back and it was the most reverent
[1:09:14] feeling I've ever had to this day in my
[1:09:16] life I just put my head down straight
[1:09:17] down
[1:09:18] into my bed and said Thank You Lord and
[1:09:20] the Lord wrote his word on my heart
[1:09:23] this was his holy spirit leading me
[1:09:25] supernaturally
[1:09:27] we each need that we need to be led
[1:09:29] supernaturally by the Holy Spirit
[1:09:32] that's what scripture said as many as
[1:09:34] are led by the spirit of God they are
[1:09:36] the sons of God
[1:09:38] and we know the spirit of God will never
[1:09:39] lead us separate from this word
[1:09:43] and now I have no idea where I'm at in
[1:09:45] my notes
[1:09:54] yeah
[1:09:56] things that are to be
[1:10:00] I love this quote
[1:10:02] and I do not think that heaven
[1:10:04] I had to just read this to
[1:10:07] because I just enjoy it so much some of
[1:10:10] it doesn't have to do with this only a
[1:10:12] small portion but I do not think that
[1:10:14] heaven is a place that my mother used to
[1:10:16] tell me about I believe that the church
[1:10:17] has growed from that
[1:10:19] to think it used to be a hundred years
[1:10:21] ago or two I think the old-timers used
[1:10:23] to think that everyone that died went up
[1:10:25] to heaven and had a harp and sit there
[1:10:27] on the clouds and played a harp now they
[1:10:29] know there was a place called heaven but
[1:10:31] they if that be so all the musicians
[1:10:33] would have it on us you see
[1:10:35] but it isn't that kind of a place it
[1:10:39] isn't playing Harps at all I believe
[1:10:40] don't believe the Bible teaches that but
[1:10:42] that was a conception that they had
[1:10:44] before the fullness that's the portion
[1:10:46] that I wanted to get to before the
[1:10:48] fullness of the word
[1:10:50] come into existence or the opening of
[1:10:53] The Seven Seals that's promised to us in
[1:10:57] this age
[1:10:58] that we then understand
[1:11:00] I believe that heaven is a real place
[1:11:03] someday I want to preach on heaven
[1:11:06] just the same as this is a real place
[1:11:08] see for God started us in our spiritual
[1:11:10] growth in this place and I believe that
[1:11:12] heaven is a place just as real as this
[1:11:15] where we don't set up there for eternity
[1:11:17] and just sit there on a cloud we don't
[1:11:19] just strum our harp for all from here
[1:11:21] ever but we're going to a real place
[1:11:24] where we're going to do things where
[1:11:26] we're going to live we're going to work
[1:11:28] we're going to enjoy we're going to live
[1:11:30] we're going to life to a real eternal
[1:11:32] life we're going to heaven a paradise
[1:11:34] just like Adam and Eve worked and lived
[1:11:36] and eat and enjoyed in the Garden of
[1:11:39] Eden before sin came in we're on our
[1:11:41] road right back there again just right
[1:11:43] back the first Adam through sin taking
[1:11:46] us out the second Adam through
[1:11:48] righteousness bring us back in again
[1:11:49] justifies us and brings us back in I
[1:11:54] thought that was astounding that even
[1:11:55] brother banham said the true Revelation
[1:11:57] and understanding of what heaven is like
[1:12:00] came into existence through the opening
[1:12:03] of The Seven Seals certainly they had it
[1:12:05] before but it was lost to the ages and
[1:12:07] spiritualized
[1:12:09] I mean sometimes you picture heaven or
[1:12:11] you see people put it forward in their
[1:12:14] their shows and it's like the sterile
[1:12:16] place with a white background and
[1:12:17] there's Misty clouds and my goodness
[1:12:20] what nonsense if you can picture what
[1:12:22] heaven is picture this Earth
[1:12:24] with no sin no sickness no sorrow no
[1:12:27] pain and no death
[1:12:33] but the fullness of the word that's the
[1:12:36] portion I wanted to draw from this the
[1:12:38] fullness of the word has come into
[1:12:39] existence through the opening of The
[1:12:43] Seven Seals amen
[1:12:46] see how important the opening of the
[1:12:48] seventh seals are
[1:12:53] yeah we don't want to we don't want to
[1:12:54] minimize that what a thing you see
[1:12:56] brother Branham speaking over and over
[1:12:59] and over again almost every sermon he
[1:13:01] preached after the seals were open he
[1:13:02] mentioned the seals in one way or
[1:13:05] another what a Monumental thing that was
[1:13:09] that fullness of the word coming back to
[1:13:11] us
[1:13:15] you know they probed at it through Seven
[1:13:17] Ages
[1:13:19] but now it's been manifested in the
[1:13:21] seventh
[1:13:22] we are restored back to the fullness of
[1:13:24] the word that was delivered through the
[1:13:27] apostles and the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:30] in the my PowerPoint left Ethan
[1:13:35] in the Feast of the trumpets says now
[1:13:37] the hidden mysteries of Christ was fully
[1:13:40] revealed in the Seven Seals
[1:13:44] also in the Feast of the trumpets he
[1:13:45] says the first chapter of the Bible in
[1:13:48] the beginning Genesis one woman didn't
[1:13:50] miss believe it but she just
[1:13:52] misinterpreted let Satan misinterpret to
[1:13:55] her one word surely and then from that
[1:13:57] caused all this trouble and that was God
[1:13:59] speaking God's word
[1:14:01] and in the last chapter of Revelation
[1:14:03] Jesus himself the same God said
[1:14:05] whosoever shall take one word out or add
[1:14:08] one word to it
[1:14:10] this he's speaking of the Bible this is
[1:14:13] the complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:14:15] and the Seven Seals had the Mysteries
[1:14:18] hid of what it all was and is supposed
[1:14:20] to open it in the last days at the
[1:14:22] laodicean age at the end of time thanks
[1:14:24] be to God that finishes the message to
[1:14:27] the church that finishes it when they
[1:14:29] look back and see what has been and see
[1:14:31] where it's all brought up to that
[1:14:32] finishes it the A's age of the church
[1:14:37] amen now in in seed is not here with the
[1:14:39] shuck now notice but at the opening of
[1:14:42] The Seven Seals Revelation 10 the full
[1:14:45] word is to be born into manifestation
[1:14:48] again and Vindicated by the spirit of
[1:14:51] God Amen and it has been this is history
[1:14:54] this is history
[1:14:56] is in the full strength as it was when
[1:14:59] he was here on Earth
[1:15:00] manifested in the same way doing the
[1:15:03] same things that it did when it was here
[1:15:05] on Earth amen Hebrews 13 8 said Jesus
[1:15:08] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:15:11] forever in Saint Luke 17 30 Jesus said
[1:15:14] in the last days as it was in the days
[1:15:17] of Sodom when the son of man will be
[1:15:19] revealing himself again it'll be the
[1:15:22] same
[1:15:23] thing amen
[1:15:25] amen amen you know I I seen somebody say
[1:15:28] the other day a prominent Christian
[1:15:30] person
[1:15:31] said God never gives a word to one
[1:15:35] person to give it to somebody else
[1:15:39] can you can you imagine
[1:15:41] can you imagine that thought he never
[1:15:44] gives a word through someone he'll only
[1:15:46] give it to you directly
[1:15:51] have you ever read the scripture where
[1:15:52] it says you're Simon the son of Jonas
[1:15:56] well that was a word
[1:15:58] have you ever read the scripture where
[1:16:00] it says before Philip called you when
[1:16:02] you were under the tree I saw you
[1:16:04] I mean isn't the whole Bible a word from
[1:16:07] one person given to us
[1:16:12] the modern religious world is blind
[1:16:17] they have gone to such extremes to try
[1:16:20] to prove their false Doctrine
[1:16:23] they can't see reality and and the sad
[1:16:26] part is message Believers will read
[1:16:28] these things and be oh gee I'm hot under
[1:16:31] the collar I just don't know how to
[1:16:32] answer that read your Bible
[1:16:37] grow up
[1:16:38] let's grow up
[1:16:40] we're called to mature manhood
[1:16:44] you know I'm not trying to down uh to
[1:16:46] speak down and I'm sorry if I said that
[1:16:49] with the wrong attitude but we do need
[1:16:51] to grow up
[1:16:52] we need to
[1:16:54] grow into the scripture says that we
[1:16:56] will in this age grow into a mature
[1:16:58] manhood we need to have spiritual
[1:17:00] discernment each one of us should have
[1:17:02] discernment to be in a situation and we
[1:17:04] see someone says oh there's a revival
[1:17:06] going on over there
[1:17:08] okay is there
[1:17:11] it don't take a long debate to know the
[1:17:13] quest answer the question
[1:17:14] don't take many minutes searching the
[1:17:17] table app
[1:17:18] to find an answer to the question
[1:17:21] and this one's saying this and where is
[1:17:23] the spiritual
[1:17:25] gumption
[1:17:26] to have discernment to look at a
[1:17:29] situation and go go to the scriptures
[1:17:31] and go to prayer and go forward with the
[1:17:34] Lord we need
[1:17:36] to come up higher we need to grow into
[1:17:39] this place where we can look at a
[1:17:40] situation
[1:17:42] with Grace
[1:17:44] with love
[1:17:46] but be able to see through we don't
[1:17:49] swallow down every
[1:17:51] the wind of doctrine that comes by our
[1:17:53] way
[1:17:56] that's part of growing into the fullness
[1:18:03] I mean look at that quote if the full
[1:18:05] word is to be born into manifestation
[1:18:08] again
[1:18:10] and it's this is not talking merely
[1:18:12] about something it's it was it started
[1:18:14] out as outside of us right
[1:18:17] started out outside of us through the
[1:18:18] prophet
[1:18:20] God Vindicated his ministry
[1:18:22] you're not Vindicated
[1:18:25] you're not bringing Malachi 4 God
[1:18:28] selected a man to do that through he
[1:18:31] proved that through he did Miracles
[1:18:32] through him
[1:18:34] none of us will ever be on that level
[1:18:36] okay but
[1:18:39] it wasn't supposed to just stay in that
[1:18:41] man and for us oh look at that man
[1:18:44] otherwise God would have kept him here
[1:18:45] and until the rapture
[1:18:49] no we're not supposed to just do that
[1:18:50] we're supposed to actually take what
[1:18:52] kind of Fellowship that that man had
[1:18:56] okay again not this on the same level
[1:18:59] not talking to the angel of the Lord but
[1:19:01] the same relationship with Christ
[1:19:04] that we are to have the full word is to
[1:19:08] be manifested then through us
[1:19:10] and so in the if it's going to be in
[1:19:12] full strength
[1:19:13] then it needs to be in full maturity as
[1:19:16] well which scripture clearly Bears
[1:19:18] record of that we're gonna I'm gonna
[1:19:19] pull up something just to remind you
[1:19:22] Ephesians 4.
[1:19:37] in verse we'll just start at verse 11
[1:19:39] and he gave some Apostles and some
[1:19:41] prophets some evangelists and some
[1:19:43] pastors and teachers
[1:19:44] for the perfecting or the equipping of
[1:19:47] the Saints for the work of the ministry
[1:19:49] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[1:19:52] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:19:55] faith
[1:19:55] and of the knowledge of the son of God
[1:19:58] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[1:20:01] the stature of the fullness of Christ so
[1:20:05] there's that's where maturity comes in
[1:20:07] for what purpose that we henceforth be
[1:20:09] no more children tossed to and fro and
[1:20:12] carried about with every wind of
[1:20:14] Doctrine by the slight of man and
[1:20:16] cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
[1:20:18] wait to deceive but speaking the truth
[1:20:21] in love may grow up into him in all
[1:20:25] things which is the head
[1:20:26] even Christ from whom the whole body
[1:20:29] fitly joined together and compacted by
[1:20:31] that which every joint supplyeth
[1:20:33] according to the effectual working and
[1:20:35] the measure of every part makes increase
[1:20:38] of the body under the edifying of itself
[1:20:40] in love there's a body Ministry every
[1:20:43] part of the body is working to build up
[1:20:46] other parts you're you're here not to
[1:20:48] just sit here and say Amen you're here
[1:20:51] to build up one another
[1:20:53] help one another grow in Christ and the
[1:20:57] purpose is is this body grows into
[1:20:59] maturity
[1:21:00] we call it Perfection that's the word
[1:21:02] that you hear often but that simply
[1:21:05] speaks of maturity
[1:21:07] we're growing to maturity when we grow
[1:21:09] to that full maturity what happens we're
[1:21:12] gone
[1:21:15] the bride is gone
[1:21:17] and so Revelation 10 the mighty Angel
[1:21:20] comes down with an open book
[1:21:22] the seven the seven Thunders under their
[1:21:24] voices the seventh angel
[1:21:27] reveals what the seven Thunder spoke to
[1:21:29] us that finishes the mystery of God then
[1:21:32] we take then that deliver that book is
[1:21:34] delivered to John who represents the
[1:21:36] bride
[1:21:37] and that bride takes the book and she
[1:21:39] eats the book
[1:21:41] and prophesies again so she takes the
[1:21:44] book
[1:21:45] and what is it it's the full word
[1:21:47] and that full word
[1:21:49] that she digests is then prophesied
[1:21:52] forth is manifested forth both in her
[1:21:56] words
[1:21:57] what she speaks and the life that she
[1:21:59] lives
[1:22:02] Matthew 24 37 back to the PowerPoint but
[1:22:06] it has the days of Noah were so shall
[1:22:09] also the coming of the son of man be it
[1:22:13] speaks of the presence of the son of man
[1:22:14] he's come down in spirit form to reveal
[1:22:17] himself
[1:22:18] through the opening of the word to
[1:22:20] restore the bride back to that fullness
[1:22:23] so that what the son of man is
[1:22:25] manifested what in Bride form
[1:22:28] what is the son of man it's the
[1:22:30] prophetic
[1:22:31] it's the fullness of the word
[1:22:33] that's what that's who Christ was it's
[1:22:35] the fullness of the word
[1:22:37] back in a people on the Earth
[1:22:41] from it is the rising of the sun he is
[1:22:42] the one who opened those seals he is
[1:22:44] those seals for the whole word of God is
[1:22:46] Christ and Christ is the seals that was
[1:22:49] opened what is the opening of the seals
[1:22:51] then revealing Christ and the Very seven
[1:22:54] angels which represented the seven
[1:22:55] Church Aid churches all completed and we
[1:22:58] couldn't even see it they did they took
[1:23:00] the picture not us and here there he is
[1:23:02] standing there Supreme judge showing
[1:23:04] that he is Alpha and Omega the beginning
[1:23:06] and the end what identification
[1:23:09] quickening power did that to us amen
[1:23:20] I I
[1:23:21] I'm going to say something
[1:23:24] so that people don't people don't like
[1:23:26] the cloud they don't want to talk about
[1:23:27] the cloud anymore they maybe they get
[1:23:29] embarrassed about it I'm not embarrassed
[1:23:31] of the cloud
[1:23:33] and I'm going to tell you why I'm not
[1:23:34] embarrassed of the cloud because exactly
[1:23:35] what brother Branham spoke about it and
[1:23:37] exactly what is spoken of in as a missed
[1:23:41] great mystery in that magazine
[1:23:44] that's exactly what it is
[1:23:47] have you ever seen the launch
[1:23:50] of a uh uh what do they call it this
[1:23:54] like the Challenger the spacecraft
[1:23:58] those Rockets have you ever seen that
[1:24:01] what does the cloud look like
[1:24:05] straight line no
[1:24:08] it goes like this but then as it goes
[1:24:11] through levels of the atmosphere what
[1:24:13] happens it's not a line it's like this
[1:24:15] why is it like that because every layer
[1:24:18] of atmosphere is blowing in a different
[1:24:21] direction
[1:24:23] and then certain areas there's not even
[1:24:25] any any blowing at all
[1:24:28] so when you see that kind of thing
[1:24:30] happen
[1:24:31] you say okay that's the that's what the
[1:24:34] launch of a rocket looks like
[1:24:36] so instead we have this pyramid-shaped
[1:24:39] thing which was exactly prophesied
[1:24:41] brother Branham said it would be pyramid
[1:24:42] shape before it ever came and there it
[1:24:45] was pyramid shape on its side
[1:24:47] and it's up where there's not moisture
[1:24:50] and there's way more details there's a
[1:24:52] brother in uh
[1:24:54] in Georgia that that works at a nuclear
[1:24:58] plant and all he does is calculate
[1:25:00] moisture
[1:25:02] and he's he he spoke about this at
[1:25:05] length and studied it and said uh the
[1:25:10] the amount of moisture that comes from a
[1:25:12] rocket
[1:25:13] a ship is so small compared to the size
[1:25:17] of the cloud that that appeared in 1963.
[1:25:21] that it it literally is a joke to think
[1:25:25] that it was anything but an act of God
[1:25:28] the amount of moisture there's not
[1:25:30] there's not a no the amount of moisture
[1:25:32] that's in the cloud and I don't have the
[1:25:34] exact figures I can get them but
[1:25:36] the amount of moisture that's in that
[1:25:38] cloud that appeared is it literally
[1:25:40] dwarfs the the the the biggest rocket
[1:25:44] that we have in the world
[1:25:46] I mean it's it's one the biggest Rockets
[1:25:50] have one one thousandth of the moisture
[1:25:53] in in them that the mysterious cloud in
[1:25:57] 1963 had it was absolutely an act of God
[1:26:00] unexplainable by science still to this
[1:26:04] day
[1:26:09] what what was it it was showing
[1:26:12] Supreme judge
[1:26:15] oh brother Branham you're just pulling
[1:26:17] nonsense out of magazines
[1:26:20] okay
[1:26:21] you can think that
[1:26:24] but but to me what is it doing it's
[1:26:26] testifying in Scripture
[1:26:29] he's standing there the Supreme judge
[1:26:30] he's Alpha and Omega the beginning in
[1:26:32] the end amen amen
[1:26:37] trying to do God a service 1965.
[1:26:40] but now is the bride calling now is when
[1:26:43] the Seven Seals has been opened now when
[1:26:45] the complete things that the reformers
[1:26:47] left has to be opened and only Malachi 4
[1:26:50] can do that because it takes the
[1:26:52] Revelation straight from God to an
[1:26:55] individual
[1:26:56] to do so
[1:26:58] yeah amen
[1:27:00] amen that's a two-fold thing takes a
[1:27:03] revelation straight from God to a
[1:27:06] prophet
[1:27:07] but then that Revelation has to go from
[1:27:10] being in the prophet's lips
[1:27:12] to being inside of you
[1:27:14] you have to get that Revelation not by
[1:27:16] scientific learning but but God taking
[1:27:20] his word by the Holy Spirit and writing
[1:27:22] that word on his heart
[1:27:24] how do how do I enter into this fullness
[1:27:27] of the word
[1:27:29] neither hath an ear let him hear
[1:27:31] what the spirit is saying unto the
[1:27:33] churches
[1:27:34] we're not saved by faith and then
[1:27:36] somehow we come into the fullness of the
[1:27:39] word by our good works
[1:27:41] it's by faith it's by a spiritual
[1:27:43] revelation God gives it to you and then
[1:27:46] what word are you feeding on
[1:27:52] it's by faith do you receive it do you
[1:27:54] believe it musicians come
[1:27:57] brother Branham came with thus saith the
[1:28:00] Lord to restore us back to the full word
[1:28:03] at the opening of the seals
[1:28:05] so that you and I can become that full
[1:28:09] word on us on display
[1:28:11] and you don't enter into it by being a
[1:28:13] good person
[1:28:15] you don't enter to it by being nice you
[1:28:18] enter into it by saying I hear what
[1:28:21] you're saying I heard
[1:28:23] I receive and now I'm living that word
[1:28:27] amen
[1:28:29] Heavenly Father we just come before you
[1:28:31] Lord and we're so thankful for your
[1:28:33] mercy
[1:28:35] Lord for your grace Lord you've given us
[1:28:37] eyes to see
[1:28:39] and ears to hear Lord in this hour lord
[1:28:42] it's it's it's not our works it's not
[1:28:44] because
[1:28:46] we were good people
[1:28:48] Lord but you chose us before the
[1:28:50] foundation of the world
[1:28:52] and you told us Lord that predestinated
[1:28:55] seed
[1:28:56] when that light would come by the word
[1:28:58] would strike that seed it would come to
[1:29:00] life Lord and we're just saying amen
[1:29:03] to every word and saying Lord
[1:29:06] I've seen that seed come to life in me
[1:29:08] and I've seen that seat growing Lord
[1:29:11] may it continue to grow in my life

[1:29:21] pray for each one

[1:29:25] Revelation in the knowledge of you Lord
[1:29:28] just as Paul preached
[1:29:30] the eyes of their understanding would be
[1:29:32] open that they would know
[1:29:34] the greatness of your power
[1:29:37] towards us who believe the very same
[1:29:40] power that you worked in Christ when you
[1:29:43] raised him from the dead is now working
[1:29:46] in us as Believers Lord may we receive
[1:29:49] that
[1:29:50] by faith
[1:29:52] may we accept that Lord and may we see
[1:29:54] it on display in our life father

[1:30:16] Lord that they know that you're real and
[1:30:18] that you they know that you're leading
[1:30:21] them Lord if they're they're not in that
[1:30:23] condition
[1:30:24] they're not being led by your spirit
[1:30:26] Lord may they have hearts of repentance
[1:30:29] father
[1:30:31] may they turn away from the things of
[1:30:33] this world and
[1:30:34] the sinful ways of this world Lord may
