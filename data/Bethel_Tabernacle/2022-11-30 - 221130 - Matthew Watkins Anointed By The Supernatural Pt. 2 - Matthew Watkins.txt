[Music] no no no no no no no no no no no I will never go back anymore [Music] so I guess I got to I get to give her testimonies through my voice and so then I get to make a little bit more personal to how I felt um 15 weeks ago to the day um I saw my mom and at that point she just had first her first surgery for bladder cancer and the biopsy results had come back and they said that she had high grade carcinoma they weren't sure what they were going to do because she had gotten that bladder cancer as a result of her breast cancer treatment 12 years prior so the chemo they would normally use was the chemo that had caused it so that made a little bit more complicated um but the Tuesday night I worked a full day and then hirama and I went and drove 18 hours straight and went and saw her she was at my sister's at that point you know getting her post operative Care at my sister's and she wasn't doing well we weren't sure how that was going to go but one of the things that stood up stood out to us and that stood out to her and I told her about that too is an angel got medicine away it was a man that had said I survived a snake bite and I just wanted to stop by and tell you that I've prayed for you and your journey will be all right and at that point in time it's probably 11 o'clock at night and stopped at a gas station somewhere in North Georgia at that point and I didn't fall asleep I drove all the way you know and um Ram was trying to work in the back seat and but her symptoms started in on Mother's Day you know my brother had bought her a um a two-hour massage and she gone to that and came back and started she had blood in her hearing and she didn't she kind of said okay it's because of massage she was expecting her fourth grandchild at the time my sister was having her first baby in the middle of May so she was looking forward to that um so fast forward my sister had her baby she went to go stay there for a couple weeks and had found out you know she'd gone to the doctor she had the same symptoms went to doctor twice they said it was nothing she came home and um went for a walk and came back and she had let a new urine again so she was in Urgent Care that was two minutes down the road she sat there by herself and they did a CT scan and they said we think you might have something suspicious going on and uh so she got that news by herself drove herself home and at that moment in time I think I called right mom I called um I had called her on the way home and she had told me that's what was going on and that started the cycle of course but she she had great faith through the whole thing um I remember looking you know at some one of the nights I was just looking through the sermons and I just typed in bladder cancer and it was only one quote that came up specifically for bladder cancer and it was from the message the way of a true Prophet preaching 63 or 119 and the cult basically said you know Sister belief or your healing it's gone and she took that and believed upon that and um irama had also sent her a sermon by uh brother Donnie about we don't want no snakes and she took those two things and really took that to heart and said that is not my confession so they scheduled a follow-up surgery a couple weeks earlier and the cancer that went from the surgeon calling my brother who was an uncle who was an oncologist a pediatric oncologist and apologizing because he found so much cancer he wasn't sure that he got it all to say the doctor's note said your recent bladder biopsy showed no evidence of cancer and is normal so [Applause] okay he's good when you feel weakest dangerous around subtle Temptations nothing seems hopeful nothing seems Glide or is this fairing everything inside Keep On Believing believing

amen for all that worship that was wonderful second Kings chapter 2 verse 4 we'll just begin reading I would like to just minister to you tonight if the Lord would help me on anointed by the Supernatural Part Two this will be part two of where we left off last time Elijah said unto and Elijah said unto him Elisha Terry here I pray thee for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho and he said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they came to Jericho we can skip some of this all the way down to verse six Elijah said unto him again Terry I pray thee here for the Lord hath sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and has thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and they too went on verse 9. let's just begin actually just reading the verse 8 we'll read a few more Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha asked what I shall do for thee in other words whatever you want is what's going to be granted much like brother Branham Mass sister Hattie before I be notice what he says here ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he said thou has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both asunder and Elisha went up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it and cried my father my father the Chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more that's important and he saw him no more and this means that that promise that Elijah had promised him was going to come to pass he said if you don't see me if you see me no more it shall be unto thee and if not it won't and he says here in in verse uh find my place again in verse 12. and Elijah saw it cried father my father saw him no more and he took hold of his own of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the water and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he had all had and when he also had Smit in the waters they parted hither and thither and Elisha went over lord we're so grateful to be here Lord in your house Lord now we've all not one of us are here Lord without some need Upon Our Heart Lord some prayer father maybe that we're praying we're all standing in need of you me Lord as the minister here tonight along with these people how we need you Lord God to come and speak to us Lord and break the bread of life to your children would you come now Lord and give us the words of life that you've intended for our church here God on this Wednesday night service Lord I just give you full control now Lord as I Just Surrender my vessel and my self even all my notes Lord and everything that I've prepared Lord and labored for and dwelled on and throughout the day Lord I Lord I'm laying those now and I'm just bringing them to your feet and saying Lord if if you change me on anything Lord let me be uh Lord just a microphone that you could speak through to your children Lord I pray God you take complete control and Authority now we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can be seated it's amazing when you study this book of Kings and we don't have really a lot of time to get to um to really give a good lesson on this book of Kings here tonight but I think it's important that this is where our story of Elijah and Elisha comes from and I almost titled this sermon the transfer of anointing and you understand that here in a moment that's really what's on my heart here tonight my burden that I'll come back to is the transfer of the anointing and you can see why when you read the story of Elijah thank you brother Matthew and Elisha that it was a transfer of an anointing that was coming from Elijah that would come on to Elisha it's incredible when you parallel the two lives and the anointing that he's asking for when he says give me a double portion if you look through the Hebrew Jewish historians who show you what it actually means when you ask for a double portion he was asking for the inheritance of this man so in other words what Elijah has has his ministry his inheritance Elijah's Elisha's asking let that same inheritance and anointing come upon my Ministry come upon my life and you find this at an interesting time in the book of Kings when they are in you we we can take just a few minutes just to lay some groundwork here but you'll find this history of these men whether it was a good man or a bad man you can go all the way through the book of Kings especially First Kings and the writer would begin to list if it was a man who was good and it was a man who was evil and it was it was a history you know it's incredible that the entire Bible is the history of the nation not of the entire world it's a history book you don't find the history of China in the Bible you don't find the history of America in the Bible you don't find the history of Europe in the Bible you find the history of one people and one nation because it would be this one elected group that would be the most important to God and so you notice this here when he begins to list this King whether he was a ruler and he ruled uh as a good King he did that which was right or he did that which was evil and there was one measuring line one metric that you could use if the man was good or if he was evil was he like David or not he only had one metric he either walked like David or he didn't and if you walk like David like the early days of David then you were a good King if you didn't live like David you were not a good King you were an evil king and the Bible begins to list this and it's incredible when I studied this just this afternoon that in the Hebrew Bible you have your English Bible here and you open your Bible to the book of kings and you have First Kings and second Kings and what's amazing is that in the Hebrew Bible it's not called Kings but it's actually called the kingdoms and so he uses this word the kingdoms though we talk about the Kings who ruled the kingdoms it's amazing that it's actually called the kingdoms of Israel because they were going to be led by Kings but in the in this book it's actually called the kingdoms of Israel not the Kings it's an interesting just to note just enough that in English a kingdom means a piece of land that's how you relate to the word Kingdom you use this word later and you see it laced throughout the entire Old Testament of Kingdoms all the way to Jesus when he begins to speak about the kingdom of heaven and you'll hear you'll find the the Lord referencing that in Parable after Parable after Parable the kingdom of heaven and if there was going to be a kingdom of heaven there would have to be a king and if there was a kingdom and a king there would have to be a people who were the people of the kingdom and so this is really who Jesus is speaking to the people who were of the kingdoms of the kingdom and the people who were not of the Kingdom this goes all the way through the Book of Revelations speaking about the New Jerusalem it would be a kingdom and there would be a king over that domain and then there would be people who were part of that Kingdom and that domain and it's incredible because what they were on that side in heaven in eternity if they lived in the Kingdom there it was only a representation that they were part of the kingdom here on Earth and if you're a part of the kingdom of God here you're a part of the kingdom of God there and if you're not a part of the kingdom of God here you live on the outside of the Kingdom so what is it representing in that Kingdom there was no sun there was no moon for the Lord was the light of the city what is it representative of that if the Lord is the light of the city there that meant that if you're there he was the light of your city here so you didn't live by the moon or you don't live by the stars or the storm or the uh the cloud or the day or the night but your life as a Believer filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost is representing that you're already living where the lamb is the light it's incredible it goes all the way through this to show that in English and a kingdom would mean but if you have an English to understand and you won't understand what Jesus is meaning when he says the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto the Kingdom of Heaven is like it unto a man who goes to sow seeds and and he goes and sowed seeds and then after then another man comes beside behind him and and he sows tears right behind those seeds and then the at the the servants come and say Lord should we pick up and pluck up the the tares that have been planted with the wheat and the and the Lord says no let them grow together and at the end the angels will come and do the separate and so all of these all of these examples Jesus gives you can find that it's all part of the plan or the economy that God had in his mind before Adam fell before man was ever cursed God already was moving towards this Kingdom of where you'll be not just servants not just peasants but you'll be Kings and Priests also do you believe that here tonight and so we think of this term of Kingdom as as a as a as a land or a or a piece of property you could say that to us it's like something on a map it's a it's a it's a piece of land or we would say in kings and queen days it was a realm and then that king would be over that realm but it's amazing because in the Hebrew mind a kingdom was not looked at as land or or or or a piece a parcel but it was actually looked at as a Reign rather than a room in other words it was something that was defined in Authority not in terms of area so to the king to the Jewish mind a king was a king not because of how much land he had but by how much Authority he had over that Dominion and so when we talk about the kingdom of God let me just say this we're not talking about a place we're talking about a power hello is somebody with me can you help me preach her tonight when we talk about the kingdom of God we're not just talking about a place somewhere beyond the misty blue we're talking about a power or an authority that Jesus had that has been transferred to his people and so if you say I'm a king I'm a king and a priest it's not about a king over a piece of property it's about an authority that you have over your home over your mind over your body hello that is a Son of God you have an authority that's been transferred from Jesus and he said Greater Works shall you do for I go to my father and until you recognize the authority that's been given to you you'll never run your home like a king you won't run your mind like a king you won't run your family hello somebody but when you realize that power has been given and Authority has been given to you as the Church of God then you won't let the devil run all over you and all over your mind and trespass in your home and trespass in your family and trespass in your body that's why when we pray for someone we say Satan I rebuke you you're a trespasser because this is the kingdom of God and I've been given authority over you Jesus spoke this way and they didn't understand how does he speak he speaks like one who has Authority yet he was so little and humble and so a true Kingdom and a true Kingdom the king is the absolute he's the absolute power and a real Kingdom I'm talking about the United Kingdom the United Kingdom is not United and it's not a kingdom we're talking about the kingdom of God and so in a true Kingdom the King has the absolute power he makes the laws there's no Parliament there's no opposition party there's no Democrats and Republicans there's no votes the king rules and he Rules by decree it's what he speaks that's why uh uh Ezekiel or not not it's not Ezekiel um I'm looking for Ecclesiastes Solomon in the Book of Ecclesiastes Solomon says where the word of a king is there's power so in other words not where the army of the king is it's not by how many nukes you have it's not about how many planes you have but the king it wasn't about his about his wealth it was about how much Authority and power he had and so there's there's no opposition party he spoke by decree there was no debate he makes a law and everybody has got to come in line under that law now I ask you a question here good old uh United States of American citizens would you like a king would you like a king where we have not a president not a parliament and not a not a not a a senate not a house of Congress but we have just a king and there's no votes he rules and some of you are thinking whoa where's this go would you like it King well let me tell let me ask you what if I can find a king who's absolutely just in everything he does what if I told you about a king who was so great he would lay his own life down for his people he would see that there were no poor in his kingdom there were no sick in his kingdom there were no one that was uncared for there was no outcast in his kingdom but everybody would eat at the king's table now do you want a king what about a king who had a kingdom where there was no fear there was no son there was no stress there was no worry you see the the key you see you say brother Matt what is the kingdom the kingdom depends on who's the king of the kingdom and let me just tell you there's a people who are ready to Crown King Jesus and say that's the king I'll take for my life who makes the law he Rules by his word and I'll obey that word so the kingdom depends entirely on the character of The King so you need to understand from the Hebrew title these books uh is the Kingdom of Israel and the kingdom was the rule of a man and his kingdom ceased when he ceased his kingdom was over when he when he died and then another kingdom again and Kings begins to record this so we talk about the Kingdom of Israel or the kingdoms of Israel and he would begin to list the care the conduct and the character and really it was the king's conduct and character that determined the fate of the entire nation isn't it incredible that before Kings for a thousand years before their ruled their first ruled by Patriarchs and then they're ruled by prophets and then they're ruled by Kings by priests but did you really do you do you do you do you realize that before Kings God would always talk about the people and whether it was a good thing he had to say about the people or or a bad thing to say about the people but when kings came along God refers to the evil King or the good King because it was presumed that however that whoever the King was whenever the character of the King was would identify the character of the people that's why Ahab being a king was representative of the evil heart of all of Israel as we said here before Ahab didn't it wasn't just bad luck that a bad King got in but Ahab was literally the representation of their heart [Music] and so it was important what his character was it decided the fate of the nation and so until Israel had the Kings uh I mean this move through some of this so don't get too bogged down here tonight so you could assume that what the king did everybody else would do they would follow him and what he would say and how he would live and how he would act and how he would react don't you see that that transcends that brother Brandon would even come to a church and say this the pastor depended on the pastor of the church the people if they're not careful they take on the spirit of the pastor that can be a good thing or that could be a bad thing say let's get off the pastor okay let's move to fathers do you realize that the character of the father would be representative to the character of the rest of the family that whatever the conduct of the of the man was the leader this is how God designed the family this is how he designed the home it's how he designed his kingdoms however the husband was whatever his character was it would ultimately be a reflection his family would be a reflection of what was on the inside of him watch the man here just a few years ago and I was with another pastor and we were going to a tour a tourist spot where I was preaching and there's a late young lady there in front of us and a man and she just you couldn't even hardly look she was uh uh just hardly had nothing on I mean the just every part of her showing to the entire world as they walked and I watched that man who was walking beside her and me and the pastor just began to talk and I thought here this is his wife and I thought it's incredible because I can't look into the heart of that man or see what's in his mind I don't have that power but all I've got to look at is the woman he chose and it will reveal to you everything that's in his heart Lord I don't know where you have me but I'm going to keep going for whatever his case it's a good king or bad King it's a good King they they followed the king and and they lived in peace if he was a bad King they lived in war and so in the book of Kings the emphasis is on the king it's on the ruler what he did and whether he was good as we said they measured it by by David if he was like David and and so David becomes the metric by which every king of Israel is judged and so and so we go on through this and and let me just let me just find my place here and so what would happen is is that it's it's so interesting because this isn't as you look through these examples there was a man called Omri and and you can read about Omri historically for Israel and he was politically one of the most successful Kings over Israel and politically he brought he brought more they got more gains under Armory than I think it was the the accumulation of six Kings before him and so he was a man who had an outstanding reign as a king you could say his his resume was Flawless he was he broke wealth as far as economically goes they they more soared and had a better economy under Armory because he was a genius under Armory than any other king he lifted the Armory lifts them economically out of poverty and it had a tremendous success but what's so amazing is in the book of Kings there's seven verses written about him and then he's dismissed what does it tell you that to God because why if you read the Kings and said eek Armory did that which was evil and the sight of God so what was it showing you about God's perspective whatever he did in wealth whatever he did economically meant nothing to God it meant Zero to God he said almost nothing about Armory and dismissed him off because he was evil so in God's perspective it doesn't matter what you do in this Earthly life how successful you are what you build up economically or politically to in God's mind it only matters what you're sowing into the kingdom of God I just read that and said Lord let my life be a life that's representative not of great success around me but let me live like David let me have a heart like David Lord let me be looked at as successful in your eyes Lord so we when you come all through all of this uh all of these achievements of all of these men who did Evil and God brings them all the way through the history all the way to this time to where the Kingdom's divided under Solomon and now you have these two prophets who come on the scene Elijah and Elisha Second Kings is incredible turn there with you with me in your Bible if you could we're going to take a turn here notice here in Second Kings where we've read from and we're just going to read just a few more verses out of here where we where we picked up before we had to be seated I want you to notice here in Second Kings chapter 2. this is the story of Elijah and the ministry of Elijah and Elisha and it's incredible because Elijah you could imagine Elisha was just so enamored by the ministry of Elijah just to be a have a front row seat to Carmel Mount Carmel and to see the just the spectacular anointing that Elijah operates under and the the the supernatural that accompanies the ministry and the Miracles that that happened through the life of Elijah he sees him you know you can you can go through the Miracles and and show the supernatural that was done in the life of Elijah and then transferred on to Elijah look at verse one and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elijah from gilgal Elijah said unto Elisha Tara here I pray thee for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel and Elisha said unto him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to Bethel you go all the way through this entire story I'm going to slow down just here for a moment and you come all the way through the Earthly Ministry of this man and God is totally lined you that he's going to take him home and that his ministry is over and and now there's this journey that Elijah brings to serve and Elisha through and they go to two cities Bethel and Jericho and it's incredible because in both of these cities God had done miraculous things through Elijah's Ministry and in the times of Elijah these cities both of them are serving the lord they're both you would say on fire for God but now that Elijah's Ministry is going off and fading off the sin of Elisha's coming on the scene now Bethel has backslidden it's at a very different place than when Elijah was in the full swing of his ministry and they're backslidden Jericho you'll find is the same exact way to where the people has turned their hearts from God they were dry and and Barren and and dead you could say that they were it was a dryness and a deadness that had came over this this city of Jericho and so he goes over and he's across the Jordan River and we know the story that a chariot is going to come down from heaven and it's going to pick up Elijah and it's going to translate him from this Dimension into another dimension and Elisha is going to witness all this he's going to see the the the the the the the the the crescendo you would call it the capping of Elijah's Ministry and he watches all the way through his entire life and all the Miracles and then he this old Prophet you would say this this man who's now at the end of his journey brings Elisha this young prophet and he brings him to his here's his last day on Earth here's the here's his last few hours the last day then it turns into the last hours he has to be in this Dimension the last few moments I got this to thinking of this over the last week and week and a half that it's incredible when you start looking at some of the last words this is some of the last thoughts that Elijah is going to speak and utter out of all of the mighty powerful things Elijah's voice has been used to say and now here he's coming to his last words what's the last things on his heart what's the last thing in his mind before he leaves this world and he goes into the other world and it's incredible you can read this about David and as David on his deathbed and and he begins to speak about his last words and then you can read about Solomon and the Bible records these last words the last few things that they had to say and he he decides Elijah to bring him through these two towns Bethel and Jericho and he tells Elijah to to come with him and so the Bible picks it up here and they carry together and he comes to this city and he visits both towns and and and and he gets to the bank of the River Jordan after all the all of this journey and Elijah takes off his mantle and and and and and here's a here's a here's a mantle which is just like a loose-fitting garment that he has over him you can imagine what it would look like or what it would be use your imagination but you have this long maybe robe flowing down and here here's Elijah and this this mantle is going to represent his anointing it's going to represent something to Elisha because it's what Elisha uses on the Jordan River just a few verses later so in this mantle you could say though the cloth or the the clothes the fabric had nothing really unearthly about it it was very much like any other piece of garment but it wasn't the guard it wasn't the fabric or how it was stitched or how it was sewed but it was The Inheritance or the blessings that God had saturated this mantle with in Elijah's life it was representative of an anointing that it had came upon the ministry of Elijah and you you we we we know as we spoke on last time that that word that anointing it's it's representative of something it's not like the charismatic would use the word anointing and and then people you know feel a shake or a shiver but an anointing what in the Bible meant a smearing that's so important when you look at this and then a smearing it was they would take olive oil and they would smear it or they would rub it rub it and and what was it doing it was anointing or it was placing or transferring something that was Supernatural to a vessel that was very natural and so it was transferring a blessing or transferring a promise this is father's Patriarchs would do this you find it with Jacob and and Esau and with their father it was a transfer the birthright it was an anointing it was it was an inheritance it was it was something that they were they were taking from one uh place and placing it on someone else brother Brandon picks this up here and I'm just going to pause just for a moment to read this brother Mark if you just display that PowerPoint and have it just for the rest of the time would be good and then brother Brandon begins to pick this up and he says may the Holy Spirit teach us and why Christ speak that the things we ought to know that we may and then in return listen closely to every word weigh it deeply and then may those who are listening by the way of tape may they listen close and may we be able to catch what the holy spirit is trying to reveal for we realize if he should anoint us then the anointing is not in vain it's for a purpose that it might work to the good to the Lord so that anointing was for a purpose he anointed him for a reason and let me just let me let me go a little bit further so your mind gets with my mind here when I say the anointing was for a purpose what I'm meaning is is that there was a purpose that was on the anointing and what was important is that not just that the oil that you would get oily it wasn't just that you would feel a sensation I hope you catch this here when I'm preaching it wasn't just for a sensation or for something that was bright and shiny but there was a purpose that God had placed on the anointing and when you receive the anointing the per the the point was that that purpose was transferred unto you that's why we anoint someone when we come up for prayer in the Book of James tells us to to anoint those with oil those that are sick let the Elders of the church anoint them with oil it's not that the oil itself has any special magic power or potion but there's a purpose in the scripture of a promise that Jesus gave and so we represent that purpose in that oil so that when we put it on your head that promise that Jesus gave is transferred from the Bible into your body we could use that about any any of the promises of God the point of the purpose is that there was a transfer of that promise that Jesus gave to come upon you so that anointing that he was sending from Elijah to Elisha was that there would be a transfer of the purpose that God had placed in Elijah the purpose that he had sent Elijah far behold I sinned unto you Elijah the prophet and here's the purpose that he would turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers so when brother Branham receives that anointing of Elijah it isn't just so he can do Supernatural Miracles it isn't just so that he could speak squirrels into existence it's so that the purpose that was in God's mind would be transferred unto the prophet and the prophet would fulfill brother random would fulfill literally but it wasn't his message that's where brother random said it wasn't me who appeared there on the Ohio River I was only standing there when he showed up and so what was his ministry it was the purpose of the anointing that was on Elijah and then moved to Elisha and then moved to John the Baptist and that that Ministry or that anointing would come upon and be transferred to brother Branham so his anointing was not his own anointing it wasn't an emotion it wasn't a sensation it was something from the mind of God when he placed it in the first man Elijah the tishbite and that same anointing would be passed on from Elijah to Elijah to John the Baptist all the way to brother bran and so when you hear the ministry of the tape and you're hearing what brother random saying on tape you're hearing the anointing of Elijah and that's important because it didn't rest on any other man you couldn't get that from Benny Hinn you couldn't get that from Oral Roberts you couldn't get that from Billy Graham they had an anointing and that anointing was to transfer to a certain people but when you're hearing I remind you you're hearing the anointing that was specifically sent for one group of people it wasn't for the whole world not the whole world can hear it they can't receive the anointing but when you hear that Prophet speak it speaks to you more than just a language or a story but it's an anointing that comes from the tape and it goes on to the seed and there's a transfer of that promise to the bride out over here and so brother William says if he's going to anoint us we know it's for a purpose what was it representative of that anointing that would flow David speaks of it in Psalms 133 how precious it is for Brethren to dwell how beautiful it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity it's like the anointing that flowed from Aaron's head down to his beard from his beard onto the urum thummem and from the eurom Thurmond the thumb down onto his skirts and from his skirts all the way you say brother Matt why is that important because on that urum was all of the representation of all of Israel of the topaz and the carbuncle and the and the jasper stone and the Sardis what were all those stones representative those brother Brandon says those mothers when they gave birth he said there was an anointing that Came Upon that mother and she would call out the name of that child what was it going to do the prophet said because there were to be an anointing that was upon the life of a Simeon that wasn't on the life of Benjamin that's why brother random says it's important what sign you're born under in Earth it's representative of an anointing or something that God has placed in you before you ever breathed your first breath there's an anointing he's given you there's a purpose that he has for your life and so on that urum it would represent all of the 12 tribes and so when that anointing came on Aaron who was who the high priest it didn't just stay bottled up on Aaron's head but it had to be transferred from his head to his beard to all of Israel and now that same anointing that was on Aaron Came Upon the entire nation what was it representing brother Matt that God did not intend to bottle up all of the authority of Jesus into brother Branham it would have to move from Brother Branham to the priest and let me just say this message is not a Revival of just brother Branham it's not just a Revival of what God did through in the in the life and Ministry of William Branham that's wonderful there was an anointing but that anointing moved from a prophet and it had to be transferred to a people and let me go further this message this anointing this revival is not just a Revival of preachers it's not just a Revival of ministers but it's got to move from the prophet to the preachers to the people [Applause] and you receive the anointed word brother random I heard him say that today and who do you say this is he says what is a messiah it's the anointed you become the anointed word we're going to go through some of this let's just go just a little bit further listen to what brother random says here and I want to go to slide eight if I have control do I have that up here the clicker up here somewhere looks like I don't you'll just have to go to slide eight that's fine notice what brother Brandon says here and why Christ speak just as we know now as a man asked me a few moments ago about the coming in the rapture we know we've lived the time out at the time of the and he says and the time of the Rapture is at hand you believe that so brother I was talking about supernatural strength he's talking about Moses in this message and he says we've lived the time out can someone bring me that clicker if you have it if the PowerPoint remotes back there if someone could bring it that'd be wonderful notice here he says we've lived the time out at the time and he says and the time of the Rapture is at hand and where notice not just inclusive to him not just inclusive to us but just as you're looking for Rapture and Faith God's Prophet was also looking for Rapture and faith we're looking for a Rapture in faith it's not working that's fine that's right you can control over the mark and he says that can pull the church together and give it some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in when we see a God that can raise the dead so what's he saying there's got to come an anointing they got to come and anointing because with an anointing comes a purpose and because there's a promise there's a purpose what is the promise we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in the moment and the twinkling of an eye so that was the promise which gave us the purpose but there's got to be a people who can be Anointed with that scripture listen the entire Bible there's scriptures that were written in here that aren't about you and have nothing to do with you when it talks about the foolish virgin it ain't got nothing to do about you when it talks about the sons and children of Disobedience I don't find my place in the Bible there are people who are fulfilling Luca do Revelations 3 of the church that kicks Jesus out of his own church there's a church that's lukewarm in Lydia Sia who's cold and starchy and indifferent intellectually minded and don't have any of the spirit of God let me just say that's not your anointing that's not your promise that's not your scripture but there was something written about me that said he that to him that overcometh shall I grant to sit with me on my throne even as I overcame and sat down with my father on his throne there's there's a there's a promise here notice he says a rapturing faith and he said they can give it some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in when we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor or out of the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see a God who can take a cancer that eat a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man [Music] that ought to make us rejoice that ought to bring excitement that ought to bring Revival that ought to brings Supernatural strength but listen to what brother random says it ought to do that ought to give rapturing faith to the people what ought to give I was reading the countdown this at this evening before coming out here and brother random comes to the end of that message and he says Lord I pray that you create a crave in those people and I thought about that I said yes Lord if I don't have the right crave I think that I do I crave for the Lord I crave for his word but I just want to stop and say Lord if I don't have the right craving then put it inside me [Applause] oh that's so simple but I just want to ask you is that your desire to say Lord he says Let It Be A crave and he says Christ will be so real in their bodies until he can change their body I am more convinced than ever before it is the same power that heals your body of disease is the same power that will change your body one day Christ will be so real in their bodies say what does that mean we ought to have faith to believe God can heal you if you're sick he can heal you if you're depressed he can deliver you if you're addicted come on do I got a church that believes that we still believe in the transforming power that God can take a man from the nothing from nothing from the uttermost the gutter most and can lift him up out of the Mirey clay brother Madam said that ought to give us rapturing Faith to the people I put these photos to the next slide just to think here just in our own assembly here it was a man with a tumor on his neck the size of a grapefruit then me and brother Travis went in his living room and witness this is just months ago go to the next one brother Mark here he is with a tumor ate up in his body further than that go on further than that it goes from that large black mass you see of that tumor spread to his entire body and it's eating up his entire body and he's told he's going to die but there's an anointing Upon A promise and there was a promise made oh come on somebody there was a promise made and somebody believed that promise and somebody accepted that promise and that promise was transferred from Jesus's word to Ink on paper to a person reading it to a heart that believes it and a faith that's anointed what does it do it transfers and you shall lay your hands upon the sick and they shall recover you shall say to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart and you shall have what you ask for what is that proof of there's no cancer in his body the only dark spot is his heart and his lungs and his organs why President says that ought to give you rapturing faith that if God could heal a man of cancer God can change your mother your vile body into a body that is unliken unto his with no sickness and no depression and no anxiety and no nothing whatever you need in this life the prophet of God said is already inside of the seed that's laying down inside of you all it takes is a Believer to believe that promise and to say I believe everything I need in this life is already in the seed oh don't you realize friends when a preacher's preaching to you he's not there to give you something new he's not there to put something inside of you he's stirring what's already down on the seed and when I preach the word something says amen I believe it Lord I accept it what is it it's not something from outside of you it's down on inside of the seed God placed in you and you can accept it you say what does that mean you can ask for anything that's according to his word and that promise transfers from the Bible to your life Hallelujah I'll give the Lord Jesus a handclap of Praise he's worthy of it Hallelujah you say why did that happen to give a little church in Beaufort South Carolina faith I pray for Marcus that God does more than just a miracle in his body but does a miracle in his heart but even if it never does and he's came as far as God has ever made him to come then let that Faith be transferred not just from a testimony of a man who was healed of cancer but I say let it anoint our faith here in this church tonight let us anoint it let it anoint in our let it anoint our faith to ask for anything in my name and don't doubt and you shall have what you ask for listen to what brother random says here and I'm just going to go through these and I know we got to close this 8 24. from some of the earliest listen and let's go to that one that's good that's when the light flashes from the sky trumpet sounds the body Christ will be quickly gathered together and changed in a moment taken in Heavens yes there's got to be something like that happen just heard him say that I can hear his word still in my mind yes there's got to be something like that and our schools of theology can never produce that yet they're intellectually are all right but you've got to meet that light you've got to find that something listen what was on his heart from the earliest recorded sermons that we have of brother Branham as I did scoured through this and put these quotes together and even still in a study to find as you find the last words of Elijah speaking to Elisha and he said he's saying to Elisha if you if you come to Jericho and and he's speaking some of his last words and he tells him you know Elisha just just Pastor here and it'll be a good church you can pastor this group of people and you know what Elisha said Elisha said nope you mean it wasn't enough Elijah to have to witness what Elijah did in the ministry of Elijah come on you've seen the Miracles of Elijah and here's even the prophet telling you stop at Bethel build a church get your kids here plan build a house come on Elijah you'd make a good pastor takes him from Bethel to Jericho here's Jericho now in Elijah's Ministry it was uh it was a Revival and now you come to the end of Elijah's Ministry and they're not only backslidden and cold and hardened Hearts they're worse than before Elijah's Revival bethel's the same I could read you we had it in our notes and I won't take the time to do it I could read you about the miraculous that God did in bed in the city of Bethel and they were backslidden people God sends a Prophet Elijah and there comes a Revival now at the end of Elijah's Ministry that same city is backslidden but not only are they backslidden they're twice dead plucked up by the roots it's a more impossible situation than when Elijah was there and now the prophet is saying to the Next Generation come on Elijah stay here Terry here wait here just you just live here what's he doing he's testing his he's testing Elisha he's bringing him through some tests to see will you stay with the word do you recognize what's in my Ministry because Elisha here's what Elisha was aware of until I have that mantle I'm staying right here oh Hallelujah Elijah recognized I might be good I might have seen a lot I might have got I might be a good preacher but until I have what you have what was it he wasn't going to stop I had a good sensation he wasn't gonna stop at a good Ministry or good sermon he wanted what Elijah had on his life to be transferred to him because he knew he could never face the challenge of Jericho and Bethel unless he had the mantle of Elijah and he says as the Lord liveth and as my soul liveth 2022 he would have said I ain't going nowhere I'm staying right here right beside you why because he recognized there was an anointing upon this ministry that wasn't on any other Ministry not at any other denomination not at any other church not at any other camp meeting not at any other convention there was a power there was an anointing that was upon this man and Elisha said I'm going to stay right beside you I'm not going anywhere I'm going to stay right beside you and he takes him all the way to Jerry to Jordan it's incredible because the Bible doesn't record that Jordan's flooded it's not Waters aren't raised there's no reason to part Jordan oh but there is there's no reason they could have got a boat they could have went across Jordan but for Elijah it was important to the ministry of Elisha that Elisha was with Elijah when he went through the Jordan and part of the Jordan why because Elijah knew Elisha would come to the same exact challenge in his life he would challenge the same Devils who said the days of Miracles are passed he would Challenge and be challenged by the same intellectual demons he would be challenged by the same evil spirits he would have the same powers of Darkness that was trying to attack and stop the ministry of William Branham is the same exact Spirits because Spirits never die is that what brother random taught us people die Spirits never die and the same challenges that would face his ministry would now face Elijah's Ministry and you're going to have to come here again Elisha and when you come to this Jordan tapes and books are wonderful and pictures and photographs are wonderful watching video of deep Cola to the Deep that's wonderful you get Faith by watching that but until that same mantle of anointing that is on those tapes and was on those books and was on those videos oh can somebody help me preach here tonight until that same faith comes off of those tapes and off of those stories and goes from promise to purpose to anointing you'll never Park Jordan and he comes and the Bible says he goes and he comes to this here and I just want to say that we'll just save that here just for a moment notice what brother randoms in The Firm of the sum of the earliest recordings in his ministry and that these didn't come through very good so I'm going to read them to you and you'll just have to trust me that I'm not adding anything to what brother Brandon said here they didn't come they didn't come out exactly right brother Brandon says this I know the next thing to happen now this is the message the angel of God in 1948 so some of the earliest I know the next thing to happen is the restoration of the gifts to the church it's the hardest thing I've had to do I sit on an airplane when I read this it's the hardest thing I've had to do in this pioneering work so wait a minute what was brother random doing he was pioneering the way not so that we could say that's not the way anymore hello somebody he was pioneering he was Blazing do you know the hardest thing is not to walk down the trail but to blaze the trail and so he created the trail and he and brother Adam said it's been the hardest thing I've had to do in this pioneering work is to do is to see this now he says in this pioneering work is to do this as to see the people that notice but if all the Full Gospel people would come in one heart and one Accord there would be a Revival that would shake the whole world and every spiritual gift would be in the church within an hour's time after it took place signs and wonders that was done by the apostles would be a minor thing to what we would do if we could get just get the church together it's got to happen let me read you what's not on the screen it will happen it may be after I've passed off the scene but I want to put my word in this that you might know that my voice it's this I love the way brother Branham says that I want to just put my word on magnetic tape so that it's never lost this is what I support this is what I believe you say what is it brother Matt this pioneering work to see the gifts flowing in the body of the church as I read that on the plane I typed out I said what a slap in the face it would be then after a brother Brandon Pioneers the work for a church to come later and say we don't need those gifts anymore we don't need the supernatural anymore we just got a tape player we just press play and Obey listen it's so clear and brother branham's Ministry it was never his intention to bottle up the gifts the anointing the supernatural in one person it was clear his desire was to see the book of Corinthians the book of Ephesians the book of Acts bursting out of the church bursting out of the pews breathing out of the people where it was a body Ministry not just a prophet not just five preachers a five gifts a five-fold Ministry but the entire body and he says every spiritual gift would be in the church so it's got to happen it will happen it's to my humble belief that we're living in the end time or may I make it a little more personal to that saying he says let me restart the quote he says this is my humble belief that we're living near the end time or may I make it a little more personal than that saying we're living in the end time and if I believe it's time for the restoration of the church that was promised that God would sin in the last day and I believe that this is the day when the word has been preached so much and the days getting so dark so evil till according to God's word he was to restore all that the caterpillar had eaten I know this is on your screen so this listen the Palmer worm had eaten and he says and it would be restored back and this is the day of the restoration of the spiritual gifts given unto the church I'm not just preaching on gifts not just preaching on the right just the restoration of the gifts what I'm preaching to you is that it was brother branham's Ministry that the anointing that was on the Bible would come off the Bible and it would live in men and it would live in women and it would live in teenagers it would live in five-year-olds and seven-year-olds and 30 and 60 year olds it was his desire that that promise of that anointing would come upon the whole church wise we said this last time that's why he spoke to a little woman brother Branham says God bypassed all of the celebrities he bypassed all of the riches fam rich and famous and he came to a little illiterate woman named Hattie Wright and brother random says he says brother Brandon that's nothing but the truth did she pass some kind of degree did she pass some kind of test of conduct was it because of how much of how many tapes she listened to that morning or how much of the Bible she even read her how good she was or how and was it based upon anything no it was based upon simple faith they could say I believe it that's nothing but the truth brother Brandon and brother Branham says those words when Hattie Wright uttered those words that's nothing but the truth brother Brandon brother Branham says those words moved heaven and words that might have seemed so simple you know sometimes it's the simple things you say in prayer everyone's looking for the big extravagant things you could say to God God's just looking for a little simple heart that'll say that's nothing but the truth I believe it with all of my heart I believe it with everything that's within me oh how many could identify and say that I've got simple enough Faith to say I believe it with all of my heart that's nothing but the truth don't try to complicate it it's not complicated hello somebody he said that moved heaven and brother Brandon says sister Hattie you ask for whatever you want right now whatever you have need of and brother Branham says and she had one thing on her mind her Lost Boys two lost children brother Adam said she could have asked for anything but she thinks she's thinking of not of things in time but things in eternity you say brother Matt why is that such a why is that so important because that same faith that was on Hattie Wright has to be transferred for from a promise to a woman to a people and you can have faith to ask for your unsaved children and your lost daughter and your lost son and your loss whoever it is here tonight why did Brother random speak to a storm it was not so that we could say look at what the power of God that he did in brother Van's Ministry but so that you could speak to your storm you can speak to your cancer and your disease and your sickness and that anointing that Supernatural faith would come off that page and come to a person he says and when the church puts forth another church this is from the earliest tapes that we have notice this is 1960 it wasn't so from the beginning when the church puts forth another church it'll be a Pentecostal church not 1906 but Acts hello with signs with the signs of the acts in the Apostles doing the same thing with the same Jesus working the same because he's the same yesterday and forever a Pentecostal Branch filled with the Holy Ghost signs and wonders of the Resurrection great things taking place among them they who know their God in the last day shall do exploits yes we're at the end time we go to some of the last recorded sermons that we have now we find out that in the time that when this great thing has been brought up find out that we're missing something in our churches wait a minute that the seals in 1963 have already been opened and now you have the prophet coming uh in the message does God change his mind what a title does God change his mind 1965. or at the end there's Elijah and his last words the last few things on his heart here he is in 1965. we find out we're missing something in our churches and that is the power of Christ now look I don't want to criticize I love you in genuine true love always is corrective now we're missing Christ in our church I stopped right here reading this quote and in my mind immediately left this church or any church and it brought it a little bit further and I brought it right to my home and then I went a little bit further and then I went right to my home and brother Brandon says now we're missing something we're missing Christ in our church we're missing Christ amongst our Pentecostal people and brothers and sisters there's something wrong listen and he says the old-fashioned prayer meetings they used to have all day and night they don't have them no more our women used to wear long hair they don't do it anymore it would be a disgrace for a woman to paint and use paint back in the early days and act the way that these women do something went wrong nothing's wrong with Christ see but something went wrong you remember the quote we heard on Sunday it wasn't the Bible it was the interpretation that was wrong it was Eve's interpreter and he says something went wrong something is somewhere the pulpit used to wouldn't permitted such a thing as that but it does now see the crisis is on and we're missing something or missing power that we ought to have where the big machine ought to be running up in great signs and wonders well that's building ought to be sitting so full of the power of God now till a sinner couldn't stay in here the Holy Spirit condemning it right quickly like that like ananias and Sapphira and we're missing something now we've taken you all the way from the early to summon 6062 now we're all the way in April of 1965 and brother Brandon's going to come to the God of this evil age in August and he says now she has caused the whole world to accept the scientific leadership of the educational program that Satan has given her given to her under the name of a church the leadership of an educational scientific program I'm picturing to you the God of this world when she as Eve had the very feeling of God's word in her hand she could have took God's word but what did she do to that instead of tarrying for the baptism of the Holy Ghost let science prove to her that the Holy Ghost was only for the disciples I'm reading this slow intentionally because this is the words of Elijah to Elisha and this is what's on his heart she's ten instead of tarrying she let science prove to her it's it's only for the disciples notice this instead of keeping Divine Healing going when she ought to now raising now and he says when she ought to be now raising the Dead and doing great miracles now brother Branham is referring to the church who has put Christ out of his own church he's referring to the Church of laodicea we're not the Church of laodicea hello we've heard a voice come up come out of her my people don't be a partaker of her so you be not a partaker of her plagues then let me just say this than anything he said to condemn or to rebuke the false church should never be guilty in the true church I just want to put my voice here and say God don't ever let us be guilty don't ever let us be guilty of the God of this evil age of what he explained away to Eve we ought to now be raising the dead and great Miracles taking place you say brother Matt what are you preaching I'm preaching what your expectation should be if it's not here friends if we we don't see the word manifesting in our life what ought we to do yeah brother Matt were to explain it away and say it was just for another age and it's the I mean do you realize when you place the promises of God just heard brother random my brother had sent this quote just to me the other day it was actually to a group and he says that when you place the promises of God that are in the Bible on any other age than present day you're under a delusion of Satan so when we explain away the promises of God brother random says it was for another it's and she's believed it listen to this here I still got you eight of you do I still got you 13 of you do I still got you I heard somebody on the internet say Amen praise God when the Bible said this is the Bible the things that I do shall you do also amen Jesus said that go you into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature I love this we're still creatures these signs shall follow not brother Branham hello these Sons shall follow not brother Bosworth I'm reading a quote here brother Adam saying that not brother Bach not brother not brother Bosworth not brother Roberts but these shall these signs shall follow every one of them that belief I believe I'm a Believer I may not have much but I have this I believe I believe the promise of God I accept it for my life but she denies every bit of it she denies all the Supernatural and she swapped it for his intellectual conception of the Bible where priests and Holy Father so-called were Bishops archbishops District presidents General overseers so for us to put their own interpretation to it and God has left them set their dead as 12 o'clock and I believe the same thing we live in today God bearing record of his word by vindicating what he said he would do now we know that this is the day of salvation I believe that where God is calling men from the world from a life of sin into a life of service and in the day that God has poured out a spirit from on high great signs and wonders are to accompany the ministry of this day for the matter you preaching that we ought to look for signs yes let me just kill and squash that cockroach devil right here yes you say why well you're preaching them we're looking for signs and wonders yes why because the Bible said they would be here and I believe the Bible you say brother Matt what are we to do we're to lay aside every weight and every sin that does so easily beset us every thought and every idea that we have and believe every word that has been spoken all of it and he says great signs and wonders are to accompany the ministry of this day this is when the former and latter rain are falling together the farmer and the latter rain are falling together what was it the former Reign the teaching rain that's still happening now if we just have the latter rain why do you have this quote of brother Adam saying they fall together we're still teaching word that's why we're preaching what is that latter rain brother random says that latter rain was only to anoint what was in the ground that was sown by the former ring so that's why brother random says if you sow denominational seeds when the latter rain comes which is the rapture rain which is the Harvest rain which look around you it's the rain that's falling right now it's the rain of Revival it's the reign of rejoicing it's the the reign of shouting on the tares and the wheat listen just because the terror Pentecostal Terrors are shouting don't mean we ought not to shout the wheat shouts right with the dares the latter rain the farmer the latter rain only anoints what you've put in the ground so the methodists have sowed Methodist seed so they've reaped Methodist the Baptists have sowed Baptist seeds so they reap in the latter rain a Baptist lifestyle and a Baptist preaching and a Baptist Church you say then what did we sow we sowed The Original Seed from the original God and if you sow the original word when the latter ring comes you'll reap the original benefits and promises and words to your family and your children and your children's children he says this is when they're supposed to be great signs and wonders which in many great and many great denominations this is turned down days of Miracles are passed that's what they told you brother Travis days of the Apostles are over that don't happen no more they sow denominational seeds and they reap denominational Harvest that's why they go through the tribulation but we didn't put listen I'm going to say it right here we don't sow denominational seeds we don't sow the Creeds of men and the ideas of men we sow the original word into the hearts of people in the hearts of our children why brother Matt so that we can get a harvest of the Original Seed I'm gonna close don't get scared but I'm very thankful I love this things that are to be December 5th 1965. he's coming down to the end here's Elijah and Elisha and the mantle of Elijah has got to be passed to Elijah Elisha I'm very thankful for these open doors that I've had he just got through saying look here he just got through saying that the nominations have turned it down but I'm very thankful for these open doors that have had to go into and the inspiration it's give to young men like your pastor here brother random believe in pastors apparently so that's calls them as I'm beginning to get old and know that my days are numbered and know now that these young men can take this message not another message not added to the message come on help me preach not taken away from the message not just the parts you like or the parts you don't like or you cut this out you take scissors and cut that but these young men will preach the message the whole message and he says these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord if he doesn't come in my generation which I'm hoping to see him I look daily for him watch keeping myself prepared for that hour to the last recorded sermon we have on tape you know the hour will soon arise there's 12 12 1965. the hour will soon arise when right Among Us will be the holy spirit will speak out like it did in ananias and Sapphira remember see the hour is arriving and we now you just remember that see this is the emphasis God is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now so that I say don't let me hinder you I just want to repeat that Lord if that's what you want to do then don't let anything I do hinder you from dwelling among your people I say let's give the Holy Spirit free reign in this church let's give his let's give the Holy Spirit Liberty listen friends don't restrict him or constrict him with any of your ideas of they ought not to do this and the music ought to do that and the music ought not to do this and we ought not to go there we ought not to say that listen to you know you can restrict the Holy Spirit by your attitude I say lay aside all our attitudes and say holy spirit move freely and our church move freely in our youth group we've moved freely in our homes let's turn the Holy Ghost loose in our churches and in our bodies and in our spirits and in our minds and give him full control I'm going to just skip this this is the last quote I'm going to read there's so much I could have read here but we're out of time his desire for the Tucson Tabernacle this was incredible go to the next slide because he comes to Tucson has one of his last places he preaches these sermons The Last Place and he preaches the message the message what house will you build me one of the last sermons brother Brandon comes to and I'm just gonna skip down let me find brother Mark where I want to go before I have you go uh there he says here and in this third slide after that go next one yes here I know that each of you if you feel like I do Paul stop reading if you feel like I do this is a good moment because now we can put a barometer on God's prophet in November 21st of 1965. what did you feel listen what was on your heart I know that each of you if you feel like I do I am so hungry 1965 November you're leaving the scene you've went around the world seven times you've watched God raise the dead a dead boy in Finland you've watched God you you've watched the miraculous happen and the dead raised come out of wheelchairs and throw their crutches down and here's brother Brian I'm saying I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stand it I don't know about you friends but that resonates with something down on the inside of my inside that says I'm so hungry how many mothers would raise their hand and say I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God move how many fathers how many brothers we have here and sisters and men that would say I'm so hungry [Music] oh can God see that hand here tonight see my hands Lord I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stand it I want to see you move Lord what I've seen you doing in Miracles that you've done here I want to see more of it Lord oh some are standing could you stand and say Lord I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God move I want to see the power of God I want to see the power of the Gospel living in men living in women living in teenagers living in our church I'm so hungry I just can't hardly stand [Music] some experiences have had just up on the mountain just to feel that once again that's something that when I was first Saved was So Glorious to my heart and we can come into a place we can sit and we see it among us that we're drying as we sit here in the desert I get among my brother and they talk with me I talk with them always in a little way of watching feeling out there with the spirit as it was to see just the condition of that brother to see what's wrong I begin to fill us all reclining the next slide I begin to fill us all reclining getting away from the spirit it's become too natural a thing to us we must we must we must we we this Church Believers we must Worship in the spirit where the spirit of God brother Adam is going to say is this the spirit of there's liberty not only our message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame of our hearts oh I just want to raise a hand and identify again let the message not just be the flame of the hour let it be the flame of my heart got to be in our heart the spirit has to pack the message here's his last words he's going to speak now just hold on musicians could play something Softly here's his last things he's gonna say this is the heart of my message I'm going to say it last things I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God move just can't hardly see now that desire has to transfer from Elijah to Elisha Elisha you're going to have to part the Jordan again Elijah ask anything ask anything whatever you ask me whatever you want will be given to you and Elisha says a double portion in other words your inheritance your promise the purpose that has been on you my desire is that purpose now that you're leaving would come upon me because I've got challenges in Jordan I've got a face I've got difficulties and impossibilities of Jericho I've got I've got a calloused and cold listen to me I've got a calloused and cold generation of people so callous that the teenagers mocked him these are hardened hearts these are people that are so foreign diseased with sin and Elisha's realizing they're worse than when you were here brother random it's gotten worse it's darker than 1965. the age has gotten worse the trouble has gotten worse the pressure for a Believer to live in 22. is greater than the pressure of a believer in 1965. the challenge of the fathers raising children and boys and mothers raising daughters there was a challenge then the challenge today that we Face my brother and my sister is greater than any other challenge I'll go further and say the trials that you're facing today is Hell Unleashed all of hell all of the all of the powers of of Darkness you face every day [Music] hello hello anybody you feel that way do you realize that do you feel that way Believers you're facing we're literally living in Satan's Eden we Face a greater pressure even just coming to church on a Wednesday night and and having to fight through the demon Spirits we've went through through just the little bitty city tiny city of Beaufort and the pressure and the the stress listen it's a greater challenge than what was on Elijah's Ministry Jericho's hearts are hard and bethel's even more sinful Jericho's even worse What's it gonna take it's going to take the same mantle the same anointing the same Faith the same expectation the Same Heart the same Supernatural brother Brandon spent his ministry blazing the trail to get a church to believe that the god of the Bible was the same God yesterday today and forever he spent his ministry pioneering a people to raise their faith up to believe that God is can do anything that you ask and now Elisha asks for anything I want a double portion of your spirit okay you've asked a hard thing heart heart heart for God no hard for you Elijah is it hard no I'm about to leave amen now who's a heart for you Elisha it's gonna be hard you want this anointing [Music] it's going to be a hard way but I'm going to give you a promise and this was so amazing when I've read this I'm going to give you a promise if you see me when I leave it'll come to pass if you don't see me when I go if you see me when I'm gone then it'll come to pass if you don't see me gone then it won't do you know if you try if you literally I got a literal translation of the Hebrew what Elijah's saying to Elijah and I hope you're spiritual enough to catch this Elisha when I leave if you Elisha see me Elijah as gone in other words if you see my ministry as over and finished and done and responsibilities met I completed my task and you recognize Elijah's gone but they're still yet a work to be done if you see me as gone you're not sitting here waiting on me to come back crying over me where's Elijah where's Elijah I just need Elijah do you realize friends how enamored people became over the ministry of brother random that we have churches now today that don't believe in Preachers they don't believe in pastors they believe a pastor gets a tape player and presses play to a tape to an entire group of people don't believe in live Ministry don't believe in the preaching of the word of God there's people that believe that say you criticizing those people no I'm not here to Banter or criticize or tear some of them are wonderful sincere Believers that are trapped in a system and trapped in an idea what is it it's a people who were waiting for Elijah and they don't see him it's gone but for Elijah to receive his Commission he's got to see Elijah has gone if you see me gone Elisha then that mantle and that anointing will come upon you and you'll part your Jordan and it won't be Elijah doing it for you it'll be the mantle of Elijah and the promise and those promises I'm just going to close have to come off of those tapes and they've got to be transferred to me can you say that and raise a hand and say Lord I'm just going to raise my hand now and say let those promises transfer let that faith transfer let that Supernatural God that moved in the ministry of Elijah let it transfer and move in my little home in my little Tabernacle in my church and my family in my mind let it operate Lord and every facet could you close your eyes and just raise a hand and say Lord that's my desire here you see our hands raised up everywhere Lord Jesus you see both of my hands up now God lord as I'm just identifying came all the way to the end of this sermon Lord just to say one thing I'm so hungry I'm so hungry to see the spirit of God moving I just can't hardly stay Ed oh Lord let that be our church that is so hungry they come every service hungry they come we'd have seen the power of God Sunday but here We Are Tonight with hands raised saying I'm hungry to see God do it again I've seen God save and fill with the Holy Ghost I'm hungry to see him do it

hungry here tonight for my needs I got my hands raised up and say Lord don't let me recline don't let me get dry don't let me sit back and just wait on watching somebody else but let me receive my commission because truly Lord we're living in the darkest age and the darkest time in the greatest trials Hall our Lord even our kids that we're raising in this generation were have it worse than what

product of last Sunday service and our dear little brother Evan Johnson is coming to be baptized you all saw him come up Sunday told me he wanted to dedicate the rest of his life to the Lord Jesus

rest of your life to serving the lord is that correct amen and you understand that baptism is an act that identifies you with the death and the burial and the resurrection we're going to bring you back up amen the death burial and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus so you're identifying yourself with him this is your way of saying hey world I'm a Christian amen amen you understand that don't you man I have little doubt praise the Lord my friends you know the Bible doesn't say in vain there's the value of thousands ten thousand worlds it would take to equal one soul and Heaven rejoices

word of prayer father we're thanking you for the life of our little brother Lord the sincerity that's in his heart is so real and Lord we're asking you now that as we take him down in baptism lord it's not the water that saves him it's his confession in Christ Lord his faith that you gave him to believe every word of God now we come Lord in obedience to the word to baptize him in your name in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that the promise of the holy spirit is then his from this day forward Lord he'll be dedicated in service to you we commit him to you to that end now in Jesus name brother Evan all right sit back down again and brother Kenneth you you're going to take him down and pick him up I'm just going to keep my hand under his head because I got this microphone Amen brother Evan in the Bible in the early church the only way they ever baptized anybody was in the name of the Lord do you understand that so that's how we're going to baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ brother Evan upon your confession and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ my brother I say congratulations as we baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all the way under all the
