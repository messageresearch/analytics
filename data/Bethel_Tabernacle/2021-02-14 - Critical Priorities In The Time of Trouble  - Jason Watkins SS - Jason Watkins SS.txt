[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do so do [Music] [Music] do do [Music] so so do [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] good morning let's stand we're going to look at philippians this morning paul with some very profound teaching to the church i want to go in the third chapter amen one of my most marked up places in my bible i've got so many uh colors and little notations and i look back on the man i wrote that 25 years ago but just meant a lot to me it always has this position that paul takes here we want to read from chapter 3 and we want to begin at verse 7. philippians 3 and 7. but what things were gained to me those i counted loss for christ yea doubtless and i count all things but loss all things catch it all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of jesus of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung here's why that i may win christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith i love this i love this verse 10 that i may know him and the power of his resurrection look at all these ends that i may know him it's one and the power of his resurrections too and the fellowship of his sufferings here's why being made conformable unto his death so that if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press i stretch i reach i strain toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in anything you be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this to you let's go to the lord in prayer father we thank you lord for your word to us that just in the reading we're taught in the bible that just reading the word of god there's a blessing in just reading it so i commit it now to you lord and father ask you to help us now in this in this sunday school class we commit it to you in jesus name amen praise the lord god bless you you can be seated paul here is challenging us and i i wanted to speak to you today about priorities and i sent forth my title uh priorities especially as it relates to the time and the hour that we are faced with and here's something that you're going to want to get your mind around very quickly what you're faced with you can't escape it it's not like there's somewhere you can go where it's not going to be though perilous times are here and men are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god that's not going to change they are truth breakers and false accusers they are incontinent and fierce and they despise those who are good that's not going away you can't pray it away and i'll tell you something else friends let me let me while i'm on that vein you know paul here talking about how that that he says he says brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and i'm reaching so so paul is actually has a plan to be an overcomer because that's what he's asked i want to know him i don't just want to know about him i actually want to know him in the power of his resurrection now there's no way first of all you'll never know him never never never will you know him in the power of his resurrection unless you're willing to go with him to calvary unless you're willing to die to you die to self and be born again of him there's no way to know him in the power of his resurrection but now watch what paul says here in verse 12. give me verse 12 brother kevin not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but watch this i follow after if that i may apprehend in other words this thing isn't i don't get rubber stamped as an overcoming believer that's not a rubber stamp from god that paul is saying i've got an opportunity to be an overcomer i'm always going to be a son of god that's not going to change i wasn't i didn't remember we were speaking wednesday night how that brother branham made it so clear you're not a christian because you desired to be you're a christian because god desired you to be now that's beautiful that's never going to change i can never nothing paul this is the same paul who taught us that nothing can separate me from the love of god there's height or depth famine peril sword uh and paul goes on to teach there how that even he himself couldn't separate himself i can't separate me from god but that that's not what we're talking about today we're talking about getting a prize pressing toward a mark there's a higher calling than just being a ground-running believer you're supposed to be a heavenly creature soaring in the heavenlies because god has you here for his purpose is not yours and there's where priorities come down our priorities really need to be his purposes lord why do you have me here and what is important to you that operates in my life god doesn't mind you making plans god doesn't mind you getting an education having a career having a purpose having a vision going forward accomplishing things doing things having things nothing in the world wrong with that that's the nature because you're you're like that because you're built in the image of god and so that that that kind of thing runs down all the way even instinctually through the lower creatures you see ants always busy because that's in their nature they know if i'm gonna live i better be on the move and so we find that that that that that's not the problem the problem is is what happens when our life runs afoul of his vision for my life now we have to ask ourselves about priority it's not paul's not talking here about getting born again he's already dealt with that about being born he's already preached that he's talking about reaching spiritual maturity he's talking about he calls it perfection it doesn't mean sinless flawlessness where you never make a mistake you'll have that until the body change but he's talking about spiritual maturity because remember friends that the that the quest that you are on did you know your own one you're on a journey god told israel this is where israel failed in the wilderness you know they they had all these rituals and all this and that and and they just thought you know we got to have church and we got to have a tent we got to keep a law and god said i you were just on a journey you were that's what you were missing i sent you on a journey i know you thought it was all this other extraneous stuff but that was just me responding to you and trying to keep you in line but i sent you on a journey to to come to a place that i promised your father abraham and many of them paul said never made it many of them who left under the exodus who crossed through the red sea who ate manna from heaven never made it to the fulfillment of what god promised abraham's seed because they didn't mingle it with faith you know when when you this is where paul is making a distinction to say listen i've already lived my life i already acquired and achieved more than you people who are reading my letter i was a pharisee of the pharisees i was first in my class i was extremely highly educated i was above my fellows and above my peers and i was being fast-tracked to the top so go ahead run like crazy to get what you think are your correct priorities i'm here to tell you i've been there i've done that i got the t-shirt it ain't worth it amen what i want to tell you now is the greatest thing you can press for the greatest thing you need to adjust your priorities to is that you may know him and in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings because we don't reign with him unless we suffer with him and too often times we are adjusting our priorities according to what we want and we don't even bother to consider god's priorities we prioritize our life and it's almost always upside down if left to our own devices in other words if left uninstructed by the word your flesh will always look out for number one you have to press towards the mark you're flushing and like that you have to strain paul says i'm stretching i'm reaching i might even i'm almost catching a cramp because i'm reaching so hard for it go ahead go ahead that'll do you good now you know what that cramping is is you entering into the fellowship of his sufferings because he's stretched he reached all the way out till he stretched himself out on a cross for you and i you know there's a a very famous story you've likely heard it it's a professor i don't know the precise history on it but you can see it many times and it's it's it deals with priorities and a um um a social sciences professor i believe is what he was who was instructing at a university and he wanted to instruct his students in the in the about priorities for life and he said and and they said that he he literally brought in a big empty mayonnaise jar and over here he had some pretty good sized fist-sized rocks and over here he had some little pebbles and over here he had some sand and he first takes all those big rocks and he starts putting them down in the jar and he says he says let me let me get that in see if i can get all these in here and he kept putting them in there and suddenly he got to the top and he still had several but they he tried to go there was no way to get the lid on he said well i guess it's full and everybody's like yup it's full you can't get any more in there he goes it's full they said oh yeah it's full you're sure oh yeah it's full until he reached and got the little small pebbles and then he started pouring them in and giving it a little shake and they trickled all the way down through all the gaps and filled up all the gaps and everybody caught it said ah well okay now it's full really you're sure it's full oh yes it's full and then he got the sand and then he started pouring the sand in and give it a shake and the sand worked in between all the pebbles and finally he got it to the end but he he holds up all of his things here and they've all he's got big rocks that didn't get to go in pebbles that didn't get to make it they'd sand that didn't make the cut and he says now watch this he says this mayonnaise jar is your life this manny's jar is your life he said the big rocks are the big important things in your life like god like family like relationships you understand these are the big rocks and he said he said now watch watch watch what happens to me he said now as long as i put them in then i can put the pebbles in then i can put the sand in but now watch this he takes it all back out and he puts then he he's going to put the sand in and then he's going to put the pebbles on top of that and now he's doing it in reverse and he's showing that the problem with people he said the big rocks are the really important things the pebbles are your career your job you know things like that the sand is just your stuff your recreational things your toys your your games your your vacations and he said a lot of times people put that in first and then they put the next thing in first and then they got nowhere to get all the stones all the big things that are important to life he said those should go into the jar first see and so it so if if you have your life many times and his whole lesson was you know prioritize your life put the important things in first if you don't you won't be able to fit them in your life you have lots of stuff in toys and games but you won't have important things you won't have the things that really matter and your family will get neglected your soul will get neglected god will get neglected why because your priorities are upside down amen you understand you get that i know you can can get that image in your mind and so a lot of times you know when when we see things happening in the world you know no one has a problem saying yeah you know i should probably let god be the ruler of my life i should that's a good idea preacher since he made me and he he sent me an owner's manual and and i i should if i want to be correct and i want eternal life who wouldn't then i should probably let god be you know the co-pilot i like i like what brother richie said at the men's breakfast he said these people run around with this bumper sticker on their car says god is my co-pilot richie said hey if he ain't driving richie ain't riding and so so so it's it's important to let him be to be the pilot of your life he's to be the guide of your life now people don't have a problem with that as a concept what ends up happening and the rub always ends up with once god reveals his direction for their life it don't match their priority list and the things that they want to accomplish you say well if i do that i'll never get to these items on my bucket list i'll never become this or achieve that or own that and and there's where the real problem comes and so because of that when people begin to to discover god's priorities for their life now it's an altogether different thing and you know it i mean even even in life when people when people suffer and things go wrong in their life and you know as a preacher here i am trying to tell them to say you know god is in control of mankind the bible says he leads kings around but like like a a ring puts a ring in their nose and leads them and you start preaching about this sovereign god who's in control of everything big and small and here you've got a person with almost an unspeakable tragedy and they're going really and this is the guy you want me to serve and he let this happen in my life and you tell him he's in control you know and and and there's there's things that happen to you and i yeah in our lives and it creates a question and and i'm here to i'm just be honest with you sometimes your life i've had it happen in my life something happens in my life that produces a question and the and the question that has plagued mankind for since the dawn of time is a three-letter word why kids start asking it before that's one of the first words they learn they want to know why you can't have it why and so so it's it's natural in man to ask a question and sometimes the answer to the why of whatever has happened in your life wherever you came from wherever you got here whatever you went through you know i could just say that was then this is now but why preacher well it might be now maybe i can give you an answer in the bible but it might be that the answer you're looking for is on the other side and you might never fully get it on this side but that misses the whole point i can promise you this if you'll just let god be the lord of your life it doesn't matter what happens to you in the long run if you're willing to to prioritize god's will for your life you may miss out on things you may you may lose things you may have to watch your peers accelerate past you and rise above you you know i remember that i remember that very well i remember as a young man and and my wife and i had children very early and we believed very strongly in her being a mommy at home because i've always said there's i heard it said 40 years ago in a sermon i've never forgot it and ministers said there i can tell you sisters there is no substitute for a child coming in from school and bursting into the door and saying mom and be have a mother there to greet him and he said i get hard times calls things and i get sometimes things happen but there's no substitute for that mother you can substitute it but you're not going to find anything equal to a mother there to greet him and we made that decision and we every everybody we grew up with all of our peers all of the the gang that we ran around with as teenagers and they all got married and debbie and i got married and you know what i i had to often times sit back and watch some of them even younger than me go past me financially you know and in every way buying fine homes buying cars and here we are you know buying old jalopies and and i i know what it is friends i you know i i might like to drive a nice truck now but listen brother jason understands what it is to need to go to walmart you got to put a quart of oil in the car to get there and a quart of oil back in the car to get home again i understand what that's about and and and and but yet i wanted her there i wanted a mother there to raise the children i have no regrets of that to this day and you know i i set a priority to where now i see many of those in fact nearly every last single solitary one of them so in some cases marriages are broke up in other cases their kids are blown into the world in other cases they're now financially ruined and here i am with my family serving god and my health and i'm comfortable financially and and god has blessed me why because i put the right priority in decades ago and i maintained it and i did what i had to do i worked say you ever worked two jobs i've worked three brother brahms said the son of god's only one that will work i've worked three jobs at one time before going in the morning to do one go to another one to do another one and then head to another another one late at night and get up the next morning and do it again but i in all of that i can say that i i am so glad today not because that now i don't have to drive a jalopy but because now i have because i set the priorities for family i put the big rocks in first and now i've got sons that love me and love their mom and love each other and love their wives and love their children and i've i've been able to create that sometimes friends families don't come up that way and it becomes incumbent upon you and i to break a cycle and i just want to tell you something if you don't come from a stable environment of love like i did say my home was broken and this happened well break the cycle set a new priority cause and and if you've been blessed enough to come from a home of love like that pass it on will you because the world is dying for some good examples of priorities and so we find then that that you know uh god looks down upon our lives and you know when we recognize that god is in control over everything uh you know it's hard sometimes i've seen people do it it's hard sometimes not to blame god but remember i want to give you this point before i close i've seen people do that david speaks to us uh in psalm 16. can you find that brother kevin psalm 16 11. i got just a about two minutes of regulation and i'll try not to go into the overtime psalm 16 11 thou wilt show me the path of life now look at this in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures forever more so a lot of times friend it's it's joy comes to those who wait on the lord you're going to want to be in his presence you're going to want to spend time in his presence because i'm here to tell you it ain't a fancy house or a nicer car or more recreation that's not gonna bring you joy that can bring you pleasure but that's not joy that's not peace you understand that's not contentment that's not satisfaction joy the real joy comes in in the presence is the fullness of joy living your life prioritizing your life here at the end time to to not just spend time in the presence of the lord your whole life is an occupation of the presence of the lord the lord has occupied you you're you're an occupied world god has come down and taken over your territory he he thinks through your thoughts he feels through your heart he acts and reacts according to his good pleasure we're going to need it friends this is the hour that we have arrived at and i will assure you that we're going to need to have this steadfast in our lives amen stand with me and let's just go to the lord in prayer father we thank you today lord for this instruction in the word and i i pondered quite a bit lord i i must confess i pondered quite a bit what it is lord that you would want said to to the church today in the sunday school class father we're thanking you for it i thank you for this inspiration that came to me this morning early and father we now let the word which is a seed that's been sown may the holy spirit water that seed day and night and bring it forth we commit it now to you in jesus name amen god bless you friends we'll see you shortly in the main service [Music] you
