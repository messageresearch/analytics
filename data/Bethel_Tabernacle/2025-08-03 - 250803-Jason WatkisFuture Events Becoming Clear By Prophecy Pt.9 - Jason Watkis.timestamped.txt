[34:08] Charles, just hold your applause for a
[34:10] second. Brother Charles Alderman, uh,
[34:12] Brother George Buckman, Brother Jason,

[34:18] Dears, Chris Watkins, get off the drum.
[34:21] Stand up. Come on, stand up as I call

[34:32] brother. Brother Caleb Buckman, who's in
[34:34] the back, uh, mixing there. We just want
[34:36] to I just wanted to show you just for a
[34:38] minute these that labored and uh made
[34:41] that possible. Why don't we give them a
[34:42] round of applause?
[34:49] So, thank you for your help. Uh like I
[34:51] said, most of those didn't uh they did
[34:52] it for you. Those of you that have
[34:54] children that will get to enjoy that.
[34:56] Amen. We just wanted to make that
[34:58] possible. Um just one more thing I just
[35:02] wanted to say. Um some of now that we
[35:05] have that um we have some rules uh that
[35:09] that have been we've been real leaning
[35:10] on over the past few weeks for the
[35:13] toddler uh carpet crawlers area uh back
[35:16] there in the fellowship hall that we
[35:18] want to read to you and make sure that
[35:20] you uh the parents especially
[35:23] um will make sure you you enforce this.
[35:26] We want to make sure that it's clear,
[35:28] really clear, as I said, we've been
[35:29] lenient because we didn't have this,
[35:31] that any children um that are seven and
[35:35] up are not permitted at any time at any
[35:38] time in that play area. So, six and
[35:41] under is who that toddler area is for.
[35:42] Parents, please, if your children are in
[35:44] there, please ask them to leave. Tell
[35:47] them they're not. Don't just We're going
[35:48] to post these rules up before we've got
[35:51] them posted on the glass, but just
[35:52] because they're posted, don't just
[35:54] assume your children will obey them. Um,
[35:57] some of them can't read them. So, just
[36:00] make sure that you enforce that
[36:01] yourself. We don't want to have to ask
[36:04] Brother Luther to um to say something or
[36:06] to get them out of there.
[36:09] So, uh you just avoid that like the
[36:11] plague. And we'll um uh also toys. This
[36:15] is important. The toys that we bought
[36:17] and purchased toys for the toddler area,
[36:19] they are for the toddler area only.
[36:22] They're not permitted in the fellowship
[36:24] hall at all. So, please do not let your
[36:28] children do not take those toys out of
[36:30] there. They are designated for that
[36:32] spot. Um, keep them in the playyard
[36:35] only. The last few services, they were
[36:37] brought in and spread out throughout the
[36:39] fellowship hall, which created quite a
[36:41] mess for the ones that clean the
[36:43] fellowship hall. for the person that
[36:45] cleans. Also, we're getting reports that
[36:47] there were balls being thrown from there
[36:49] in the fellowship hall and a picture
[36:50] almost came down. So, we want to
[36:52] remember to keep those toys in there at
[36:55] at all times. Um, if you see your child
[36:57] taking them out, put them back in. Um,
[37:00] because of the rain through the week,
[37:02] before you leave that area, before you
[37:05] leave on Wednesday or before you leave
[37:07] on Sunday, please clean up the toys. Um,
[37:11] and put them back in the provided bins
[37:13] that we have. And those bins are stored
[37:16] under the bench that's out there. So,
[37:18] put them back in the bins. Don't leave a
[37:19] mess, please. If you do, then it gets
[37:22] rained on and those toys won't last. Um
[37:24] the screening that we have uh doesn't it
[37:26] just provides shade. We got it
[37:28] intentional that the water through so as
[37:30] to not sag. So make sure please do a
[37:33] good job uh cleaning that area up. Um
[37:36] also as I said um we've been real
[37:38] lenient these past few weeks because we
[37:40] know it's hard for the older kids but um
[37:43] uh because they didn't have anything but
[37:45] now that that that they do please uh
[37:47] know that we're going to try to enforce
[37:49] these rules um as best as possible.
[37:52] Amen. Man, was that a little easier than
[37:54] if I had Brother Luther read these
[37:56] rules?
[37:58] I'm just teasing Brother Luther. I love
[38:00] you. Amen. We all love. Don't we all
[38:02] love Brother Luther? Amen. Give the Lord
[38:04] a hand clap of praise. Let's all stand
[38:06] back to our feet. You ready for the word
[38:08] this morning? Did you come with a need?
[38:10] How many have a need and expectation?
[38:12] Let's just turn our hearts to the Lord
[38:14] now. Amen. Raise our hands and and sing
[38:16] this with brother. Jesus said, "I want
[38:20] that holy
[38:23] [Music]
[38:24] life.
[38:27] I want that holy life. I want that holy
[38:33] way. I want to be free from strife and
[38:37] do what Jesus said. I want that holy
[38:45] life. I want that holy life. I want that
[38:51] holy way. I want to be free from strife
[38:56] and do what Jesus said. I want that holy
[39:03] [Music]
[39:05] life.
[39:08] [Music]
[39:13] Praise. Sorry. Okay. Amen. You got me.
[39:18] Okay. Praise the Lord. I'm hearing a
[39:21] feedback echo. Oh, okay. You'll fix it.
[39:24] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you.
[39:26] Turn around and shake hands with
[39:27] somebody. Say, "God bless you." Happy to
[39:29] have you here in the house of God today.
[39:32] Amen.
[39:33] Amen.
[39:36] Sure appreciate all of that and all of
[39:38] those announcements and I appreciate all
[39:40] the people who make made all that
[39:42] possible. Amen. And praise God. I uh I
[39:46] was over here studying yesterday in my
[39:47] office and I brought my a really nice uh
[39:50] I would have never bought it. I'd have
[39:52] never known to bought it, but I have a
[39:53] good friend, but I won't uh call his
[39:56] name, but his initial was a Mark Carter.
[39:58] And he he turned me on to this amazing
[40:02] little handheld drill. It was so light.
[40:04] I'd been using some big bulky DeWalt
[40:06] thing. I thought it was a manly thing.
[40:07] And Mark shows up with this little bitty
[40:09] guy. And man, it felt good in my hand.
[40:12] So, I went and bought one and I covered
[40:14] that thing. I'm careful about it and I
[40:16] brought it yesterday.
[40:18] I thought, who can I loan this to? It's
[40:22] going to have to be somebody that's used
[40:23] to handling delicate equipment. I said,
[40:26] "Brother Andrew,
[40:28] praise the Lord." And so, somebody
[40:31] that's used to uh handling delicate
[40:33] equipment that won't break it and put it
[40:35] back like it goes. And um and then uh
[40:39] Landon got a hold of it. And I was
[40:40] shocked at how mechanical Landon was. He
[40:42] figured it out faster than I could. And
[40:44] which irritated me a little bit, but
[40:47] he just took one look at it. Zip, zip,
[40:49] bang, bang, and away way he went. I'm
[40:50] going, you need brother L if you No.
[40:52] Okay, never mind.
[40:56] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. But I sure
[40:58] appreciated all that all that help
[41:00] yesterday. And I think it's just
[41:02] beautiful, wonderful. And so we've got
[41:05] more things uh that we're trying to do a
[41:07] little bit as we go along while we're
[41:09] still um you know squirreling away uh
[41:12] funds to start the major framing
[41:15] renovation of our extension. We're
[41:17] trying to do little things that we are
[41:19] going to want to do and we're trying to
[41:20] get all those out of the way. So it's
[41:21] wonderful. Amen. Hey um brother Kevin,
[41:25] I'm going to jump you this morning. I I
[41:26] sent Hebrews 13:8 and we're going to go
[41:28] there, but let's go first to Numbers 14
[41:31] for me. Numbers 14. We want to take our
[41:34] ninth installment this morning on future
[41:36] events becoming clear in prophecy. I
[41:38] think by now you know that you are the
[41:40] event.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride of Christ um the
[41:44] manifestation. You say why are we the
[41:46] event?
[41:48] Well, it has nothing to do with how you
[41:50] look or smell. It has everything to do
[41:53] with the fact. Even even brother
[41:55] Brandham said it's not the man that
[41:57] comes predestinated. It's the seed
[42:00] inside the man. See, the Bible says that
[42:04] except he left us a seed, we would be
[42:07] allto together like unto Sodom and
[42:08] Gomorrah. So there's no it's no
[42:11] arrogance or pride in it. It's just
[42:13] God's choosing completely. He gets all
[42:16] the glory. We cannot uh we don't deserve
[42:20] nor can we earn any of it because it's
[42:22] all by his grace. if he doesn't, you
[42:25] know, you might build the house and
[42:27] watch the city, but if the Lord doesn't
[42:29] watch it, and if the Lord doesn't build
[42:31] it,
[42:32] &gt;&gt; uh doesn't say you won't build or work
[42:34] or watch, it just won't do you any good.
[42:36] Uh unless the Lord keep the city or the
[42:38] Lord keep the home or the Lord keep your
[42:40] family. See, so the Lord has to keep a
[42:44] church, the Lord has to build. I'm
[42:45] constantly
[42:47] um you know, I'm constantly using that
[42:49] um uh to the Lord to say, "These are
[42:52] your people." Well, you remember the
[42:53] Lord said to Moses, you know, thy
[42:56] people. And Moses said, uh, they're your
[42:59] people and I told you they would do this
[43:02] and uh, your people have done it. And so
[43:04] Moses quickly reminded the Lord, these
[43:06] are your people. And I'm constantly
[43:09] doing that, saying, Lord, these are your
[43:10] people. They're not mine. They're I know
[43:13] I'm all the time walking in and go,
[43:14] "Hey, my people." But really, you're
[43:16] God's people. And I'm I'm part of that
[43:19] family as well.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Numbers 14 and and as I was
[43:24] saying, you are the reason that you are
[43:27] the event made clear in history and the
[43:32] modern event is because of this
[43:35] overriding fact from Genesis to
[43:37] Revelation. Every time God manifested
[43:41] himself in an expression, that was an
[43:44] event made clear in prophecy. And there
[43:47] were lots of events going on in the
[43:49] world when he made himself known to
[43:52] Abraham as a in the body of a man as
[43:55] Melzdc, right? Lots of events. There
[43:58] were lots of things going on uh you know
[44:02] in Israel when Jesus came on the scene.
[44:04] There were lots of things happening in
[44:07] Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the
[44:08] uttermost part of the earth when the day
[44:10] of Pentecost came. But that was the one
[44:14] event that God recognized in his book to
[44:17] say this is the event. There's lots of
[44:19] events, but this is the one because that
[44:22] was a further expression of God. Amen.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; So, you're an event not because you're
[44:27] you're special in your own rights, but
[44:29] because you are the continuing
[44:31] unfolding, the continuing manifestation
[44:35] of Almighty God in an expression. Amen.
[44:38] We're going to look at that today.
[44:40] Numbers 14:es
[44:42] 20- 24.
[44:49] And the Lord said, I have pardoned
[44:52] according to thy word, but as truly as I
[44:56] live, all the earth shall be filled with
[44:59] the glory of the Lord. because of those
[45:02] things, I'm sorry, because of those men
[45:06] which have seen my glory and my miracles
[45:09] which I did in Egypt and in the
[45:12] wilderness, and have tempted me now
[45:14] these 10 times, and have not hearkened
[45:16] to my voice. Surely they shall not see
[45:19] the land which I swear unto their
[45:21] fathers, neither shall any of them that
[45:23] provoked me see it. Verse 24. But my
[45:27] servant Caleb, because he had another
[45:30] spirit with him, and hath followed me
[45:33] fully, him will I bring into the land
[45:37] whereinto he went, and his seed shall
[45:41] possess it. So those those seed of Caleb
[45:45] th the the ones who are of that same
[45:48] spirit. Amen. So, so we realize that we
[45:52] are enjoined by the baptism of the Holy
[45:55] Ghost. We are enjoined through the blood
[45:57] of Christ back to Abraham. And now we
[46:00] are inheritors of Abraham's promise.
[46:03] Amen. So, it's the same. I want you to
[46:05] really pay close attention to that. It's
[46:08] not that Caleb was, you know, any better
[46:10] than anybody else, but he had a
[46:12] different spirit that was guiding him.
[46:15] And that was a choice. Y
[46:19] &gt;&gt; fact is it was more of a choice than you
[46:22] even face today because you have the
[46:23] Holy Ghost which gives you a new nature.
[46:26] Caleb had no access to being born again
[46:28] of the spirit of God like you. He had a
[46:30] gene of God but he couldn't. That's
[46:32] where brother B talked about David. The
[46:34] thing that wearied David was that he he
[46:37] said I I've tied his word to my bed
[46:39] post. I put it between my eyes. I
[46:40] meditate on it day and night. But the
[46:43] thing that wearied David is he couldn't
[46:45] make it manifest like he knew it should.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; And that wearied him. And I I just love
[46:50] the fact that you don't have to suffer.
[46:52] David's weary. Amen. You can surrender
[46:55] so freely and let your heart go in the
[46:58] direction that God intended for it. Man
[47:01] is finally free to do that. The new
[47:03] birth is the only place of freedom.
[47:07] Otherwise, you're driven by a fallen
[47:08] nature and you have no freedom. The only
[47:11] freedom is in Christ. And then you
[47:13] actually have the freedom to choose to
[47:15] be like God. Amen. Now, you still have
[47:17] to choose it, but you can choose it.
[47:19] Right? All right. So, let's read. Oh, we
[47:23] we already we've already read verse. I
[47:24] want to read verse 24 again. But my
[47:26] servant Caleb, because he had another
[47:29] spirit with him, and hath fully and hath
[47:33] followed me fully, him will I bring into
[47:35] the land where he went, and his seed
[47:38] shall possess it. Now, Hebrews 13, um,
[47:42] and we're going to just read the eighth
[47:43] verse alone. Um, I'll probably read it
[47:46] before you can even get there. Hebrews
[47:48] 13:8, Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[47:52] and today and forever. Amen. Let's pray.
[47:57] Master, we thank you for your word
[47:59] today. Thank you for this wonderful
[48:01] audience and all of the wonderful
[48:03] worship and singing. And Lord, it just
[48:06] thrilled my heart. I come in this
[48:08] morning and oh my just such a such a um
[48:13] a business of God's kingdom going on.
[48:16] And Father, as I as I come in, I can I
[48:19] can hear the word going forth from the
[48:21] Sunday school teacher. I can hear the
[48:23] worship team leading in song and they're
[48:26] practicing and getting ready. I can hear
[48:27] the the Sunday school teacher of the
[48:29] little small children, Lord. And and I'm
[48:32] sitting in my office and I can hear it
[48:33] all at once, Father. and and I've got
[48:35] the Sunday school coming in on the
[48:37] speakers and I can hear the next door
[48:39] children. I can hear down the hall and
[48:41] it just warmed my heart. Lord, I just
[48:43] felt like I'm right in the big middle of
[48:46] something wonderful. And I pray now
[48:49] today that you will take all the glory
[48:50] to yourself, your great name. Lord, we
[48:53] owe you everything. There's no way we
[48:56] could ever repay you for the debt of
[48:58] love that we owe. Now Lord, will you be
[49:01] our helper in the word as we go forward
[49:03] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you
[49:06] friends. You can be seated.
[49:27] Yesterday I had a uh
[49:30] wonderful opportunity to have lunch
[49:32] again with one of my grandsons and
[49:36] um was actually Uriah and he was uh off
[49:39] a little early and I had some free time
[49:42] and so was able to meet him for lunch
[49:46] and I I think it was yesterday. Might
[49:48] have been uh actually might have been
[49:51] Friday. I can't remember now. Uh might
[49:53] have been Friday. But um nonetheless,
[49:55] yeah, it was I believe it was Friday, in
[49:57] fact. And so,
[50:00] you know, we began to strike up a
[50:02] conversation. And I I love that my I
[50:06] love I love knowing, you know, my my
[50:08] grandchildren are constantly bringing up
[50:11] spiritual things to me and question this
[50:13] and and a question there and and talk
[50:15] about and they were talking to someone
[50:17] and those things thrill my heart and you
[50:20] know, Uriah and I got to talking about
[50:22] the the that that that um that
[50:27] divergence between light and darkness
[50:29] and and and the madness that we see in
[50:32] the world and you know the the the area
[50:36] between right and wrong, that area
[50:39] between light and darkness, that area um
[50:43] that defines the middle of ascending
[50:46] versus descending. And we talked about
[50:49] how that it's getting worse. And I said,
[50:52] "You see, Uriah," I said, "Because that
[50:55] the bride of Christ is in an order of
[50:58] ascending and that the God of this evil
[51:01] age with all of his with all of his
[51:03] followers are descending." Remember,
[51:05] Brother Brandham saw in the vision of
[51:07] the preview of the bride and he said
[51:09] when they got to the end of that edge
[51:11] and he said they fell off and went off
[51:13] into the abyss and he said the most
[51:15] horrible screams you ever heard as they
[51:17] were plunging down. And he said, "But as
[51:19] I looked," he said, "the bride instead
[51:22] of going down, she started going up."
[51:24] And I've so appreciated the fact that
[51:27] after he says, "She started going up."
[51:29] Then he says, you know, two or three of
[51:31] them at the end of the line, those those
[51:34] last day saints, the ones that are
[51:36] living in the impossible time
[51:38] &gt;&gt; when darkness is so prevalent and
[51:41] spirits are so free and go and Satan is
[51:43] the god of this evil age. I'm here to
[51:44] tell you friends, if it were not for the
[51:47] word that we have and the near presence
[51:49] of the Holy Ghost and every church
[51:51] service you can get to and every time
[51:53] you can get on your knees and every time
[51:54] you can read a Bible or play a tape, I'm
[51:56] here to tell you that is your survival
[51:58] kit. You cannot survive it. It's too
[52:01] dark. It's too dismal. I'm not saying
[52:03] you'd lose your gene of God. I'm not
[52:05] saying you wouldn't become a child of
[52:07] God because that's something that you've
[52:09] passed from death to life can never
[52:10] lose. But I'm here to tell you, I don't
[52:12] just want to be a son of God. I want to
[52:15] be strong. I want to be running the
[52:17] race. I don't want to be stumbling
[52:19] across the finish line. When I cross,
[52:22] when I used to run track, I used to love
[52:24] to cross the finish line at full speed.
[52:27] And and it was just a a matter of pride.
[52:30] I loved it. No matter how much I had
[52:33] slowed down and and and and you know
[52:36] languished along and got past and but
[52:39] when I saw the finish line in sight, I
[52:41] don't know, just as a young boy, there
[52:42] was something that came within me to say
[52:44] there's the finish line and I got some
[52:46] energy to burn and I'm going to light
[52:48] it. And I'm here to tell you something,
[52:50] friends. On all eight cylinders, pedal
[52:52] to the metal as hard as I could go, I'd
[52:55] fly across that finish line. Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Now, the coach, it irritated him because
[53:00] he he knew that that meant I had left
[53:02] energy on the track that I could have
[53:04] used. And he wasn't wrong. And it and he
[53:07] don't even know. And but it was a
[53:09] lesson. It's a lesson to me today that I
[53:11] don't just want to, you know, cross the
[53:14] finish line full speed. I'd like to be
[53:16] at full speed now
[53:17] &gt;&gt; cuz I don't know where the finish line
[53:19] is. I know it's out there somewhere and
[53:21] I know every day I'm getting closer to
[53:23] it, but I want to be running at mock
[53:25] speed. I want to be turning it on. I
[53:28] want to be I want to hit the jets.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, we we were we were it
[53:38] led in our conversation. I said, "So
[53:40] that's why Uriah because the world is in
[53:43] an order of descending." And as brother
[53:45] Brandham said, those two or three at the
[53:46] end, right at the end, and that was the
[53:49] preview coming back, you know, she he
[53:51] had already seen her the first time and
[53:52] then it came back again. And then at the
[53:55] very end of the coming back crowd of
[53:57] that restored bride tree, two or three
[53:59] of them at the end of the line uh were
[54:02] getting out of step. And every once in a
[54:03] while I look out and two or three of you
[54:05] are getting out of step. And and
[54:07] sometimes I look in the mirror and I'm
[54:09] getting out of step. But I'm glad they
[54:12] stayed ascending.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; They stayed ascending. And and the only
[54:16] thing that a prophet said was, "Get back
[54:18] in step. Get back in line. Stay in
[54:21] line." Yeah.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; And he said when I came to I was
[54:24] standing in the room with my arms
[54:26] reached out saying stay in line.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; So let me just remind you today as I
[54:32] remind my own self we need to stay in
[54:34] line. We need to be running at the pace
[54:37] of the Holy Spirit. Not ahead of him not
[54:39] behind him. And just say Lord take over
[54:42] my whole life. As brother Tony was
[54:44] singing. I I I want it all. I want that
[54:46] holy life. I want to know that he's
[54:48] pleased with me.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:52] Caleb had a different kind of a spirit
[54:55] and God noticed it. God always notices a
[54:59] different kind of spirit. I'll say more
[55:01] on that perhaps in a little bit. I
[55:03] didn't expect to use that this morning.
[55:05] Lord laid it on my heart before I left
[55:07] the house. And uh brother Jason's Sunday
[55:09] school class. I wasn't sure whether to
[55:11] use it. It seemed to confirm it with
[55:13] some of the things he said. So we we'll
[55:15] get to it here just in a little bit. So,
[55:18] you know, we our conversation then that
[55:21] that made a perfect segue to uh Uriah
[55:25] asked me, he said, 'You know, uh the
[55:26] thing I love about, you know, the
[55:29] message, papo, is that it's so evident
[55:32] that Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ the same
[55:35] yesterday, then forever. and that that
[55:38] here's a young man who's, you know, in a
[55:40] in a liberal university and all of the
[55:42] nonsense that he's bombarded with there.
[55:45] And yet he's got something burning in
[55:47] his heart that he has an appreciation
[55:50] that Jesus is just as reliable now as
[55:53] he's ever been.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; That you can count on him now just like
[55:57] the disciples did then. And it and when
[56:00] they're when they were thinking they
[56:02] were going to drown, he came walking on
[56:03] the water and he can come walking on on
[56:06] top of your trial right now. He's the
[56:09] same one.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, in talking to that, I
[56:14] realized that it
[56:17] it lent to the thought of my series
[56:19] here. And I so I just I said, you know,
[56:22] Uriah, let me add just a layer on top of
[56:26] Hebrews 13:8. It's important to remember
[56:29] and it it's um it's a little tricky. You
[56:32] have to think think this through, but I
[56:34] know you'll catch it. And I said,
[56:37] remember that one of the things he's the
[56:41] same in is that he's always going
[56:44] forward, evolving, unfolding.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; So, he's always Now, he doesn't change.
[56:51] Whatever his evolution is, it's going to
[56:54] have the same character that it had back
[56:56] there.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he but the the thing that he's
[56:59] the most consistent about, he's the same
[57:02] yesterday, today, and forever. Which
[57:05] means he's consistently all the way
[57:07] through. And the most consistent thing
[57:09] about God since Genesis is that he's on
[57:13] a mission to unfold himself into a
[57:16] kingdom.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; And everything. and this and and it's
[57:20] and because of that because that's how
[57:23] he has operated, mankind drawing from
[57:27] the tree of knowledge see him as as a
[57:30] polytheistic being. Sometimes they see
[57:33] him as two gods or two lords or three
[57:37] gods or they might see him as a
[57:39] for-footed creature, a reptile or a bird
[57:42] or something they can carve in a wood in
[57:44] a wood figurine or a stone. And and and
[57:47] we realize that this is because God
[57:50] hides himself behind the the mystery of
[57:52] that. And mankind is for sure going to
[57:56] misunderstand him except God rich in
[58:00] mercy reveals himself and and revelation
[58:04] is granted to the human that goes beyond
[58:07] their understanding.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if you just use human
[58:13] understanding, he can very much look
[58:15] like multiple persons.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Now, there's so much evidence against it
[58:20] that you dare not take that path because
[58:22] the Bible is so clear. But understand
[58:25] that you are in an extreme minority
[58:28] &gt;&gt; that the whole world even though and
[58:30] even if you can prove to them. Brother
[58:32] George and I were having a conversation
[58:33] yesterday about some people who actually
[58:37] could go back and and were acknowledging
[58:39] at 100% how it got changed. It wasn't
[58:43] part of the early disciples. It's not
[58:45] what they believed. They can track it
[58:46] through history. They believe the
[58:48] history and and at the end of the day
[58:50] they they knowing that it was altered
[58:53] from the early church but their
[58:55] tradition is so entrenched. They're so
[58:57] entrenched in their tradition that they
[59:00] still believe
[59:01] &gt;&gt; he's three persons.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; And I I I feel sorry for that level of
[59:09] &gt;&gt; of that lack of understanding. It makes
[59:12] me so grateful to God that I know him
[59:14] and the power of his resurrection and
[59:17] and I've done nothing to earn it. But
[59:19] somehow he has made himself known to me
[59:21] and he's made himself known to you.
[59:23] There's nothing more valuable. You'll
[59:25] never chase, you'll never accomplish,
[59:26] you'll never acquire, you'll never
[59:27] achieve. No station you ever will arrive
[59:30] to will exceed the value that God can
[59:32] make himself known to you. And you get
[59:35] it and you absorb it and you amen it and
[59:38] you start walking according to it.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; After the fulfillment of Malachi 4,
[59:47] that's one that we talk about a lot, the
[59:49] fulfillment of Malachi 4. We we attach
[59:53] that uh through a daisy chain of other
[59:56] scriptures and we end up at Revelation
[59:58] 18:4, which of course in my mind has
[1:00:00] always been what the message of the hour
[1:00:03] is. Uh Malachi 4 indicates the spirit
[1:00:07] that'll be on the prophet and what it
[1:00:09] will accomplish. It'll turn the hearts
[1:00:11] of the It'll be the spirit of Elijah
[1:00:12] turning the hearts of the of the last
[1:00:14] day gentile church back to the faith of
[1:00:17] the original church fathers.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; But what the message is is in 18
[1:00:22] Revelation 18:4 come out of her my
[1:00:25] people.
[1:00:26] And so, so, so when we when we talk
[1:00:30] about Malachi 4 and its fulfillment,
[1:00:32] Revelation 18 and its fulfillment, you
[1:00:36] know, we we you're
[1:00:40] a that's a that's a movement. Uh, I
[1:00:43] mean, to say that's a forward advancing.
[1:00:47] There was a time when no one knew
[1:00:49] definitively what Malachi 4:es 5 and 6
[1:00:52] meant
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; because it hadn't been fulfilled. There
[1:00:55] was a time when they didn't understand.
[1:00:57] It came back with John. Paul was already
[1:00:59] gone. He had he couldn't read it. He
[1:01:01] couldn't God wasn't going to have uh
[1:01:03] Paul go through and reveal what God was
[1:01:06] now sealing up down through the ages.
[1:01:09] And the further and further they got
[1:01:10] away from the truth, the more the word
[1:01:12] of God got sealed up until the last day
[1:01:15] when he said, "Now I'm going to fulfill
[1:01:17] Malachi 4, and I'm going to unravel. I'm
[1:01:20] going to untie. I'm going to unseal what
[1:01:23] I sealed." Amen.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; So, we've been showing you that it's how
[1:01:28] that God has revealed himself all the
[1:01:31] way from Genesis.
[1:01:32] He, you know, people sometimes get stuck
[1:01:35] at Daniel, sealed up to the end time,
[1:01:37] but God was revealing before Daniel and
[1:01:40] God kept revealing after Daniel. It just
[1:01:42] meant there were particular parts at the
[1:01:44] end time that were not going to be made
[1:01:46] known. We talked about this last week.
[1:01:48] Brother Brandon talked about the church
[1:01:50] ages. God would not even let the church
[1:01:52] know
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; that there were going to be seven ages
[1:01:55] in 2,000 years. He said because it would
[1:01:58] have it would have harmed their their
[1:01:59] zeal, their expectancy because well,
[1:02:02] he's not even coming in my lifetime. Why
[1:02:03] don't why should I be zealous? So they
[1:02:06] they weren't even privy to that. Uh you
[1:02:08] know that's and so as we said Paul never
[1:02:10] needed to teach on Daniel 70 weeks. They
[1:02:13] it never needed to be understood uh what
[1:02:16] what a lamb coming forward from the
[1:02:18] eternities who had been back there
[1:02:20] interceding for ignorance. The early
[1:02:22] church would have went what ignorance.
[1:02:25] What are you talking about? He's then
[1:02:27] back there interceding for who? For his
[1:02:29] for his people. Why would we need anyone
[1:02:32] to intercede? Because you're going to go
[1:02:34] off into false doctrine. What
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; you see? So, so now we come at the end
[1:02:40] time and we realize that the message of
[1:02:43] the hour is not something beyond uh the
[1:02:46] the fundamental teachings of the Bible.
[1:02:49] You cannot add to it. And brother
[1:02:51] Brandham, even as far along as the as
[1:02:54] the as the leadup to the seals and even
[1:02:56] going into the first seal, still felt
[1:02:59] like that there were seven un unknown
[1:03:02] seals on the back part of the book. But
[1:03:04] then he comes along later and says, "No,
[1:03:06] I realized it can't be something outside
[1:03:08] of the Bible. It's got to be everything
[1:03:11] inside of here. It's only hidden until
[1:03:13] the time it needs to be revealed." And
[1:03:15] when that time meets prophecy, then God
[1:03:18] goes forward.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; And so Christianity, it should not shock
[1:03:23] you when I say you should still be
[1:03:27] growing. Amen.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; It should not be strange for me to say
[1:03:33] you should be you're supposed to be a
[1:03:35] more fervent Christian today than you
[1:03:37] were yesterday.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; See, you're not supposed to have this up
[1:03:42] and down life. You're in an order of
[1:03:44] ascending. And I'm just glad that God is
[1:03:47] in control of it all because uh we have
[1:03:50] all ended up falling off the cliff. But
[1:03:52] I'm so glad that he redeemed me. He has
[1:03:55] revealed himself to me. And and yes, my
[1:03:58] body gives me all kinds of problems. My
[1:04:00] memory, my conscience, my region,
[1:04:02] reasoning, my affection, my imagination,
[1:04:04] it all gets in my way. But there's
[1:04:06] another me down on the inside that's
[1:04:10] that was not and is not the son of Ed
[1:04:12] and Jean Watkins, but he is a son of God
[1:04:14] who came who was in Christ and has been
[1:04:17] expressed in this age. And so that's how
[1:04:19] I am able to understand the Godhead
[1:04:22] because you have to be a part of the
[1:04:24] Godhead to catch that revelation.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; You're not even open. You can't even
[1:04:28] catch that revelation unless you're
[1:04:29] actually part of the substance of the
[1:04:31] Godhead itself.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; See, so this is why brother Brandon
[1:04:35] would talk about that and use that kind
[1:04:36] of language that we're actually part of
[1:04:38] that triunity of God. That's right off
[1:04:41] the tape that we're actually uh uh you
[1:04:44] know within God's godhead. and and and
[1:04:47] so so we realize that it's all about
[1:04:50] expression. You have to just understand
[1:04:52] that God is constantly unfolding himself
[1:04:56] in expression. He's not here to unfold
[1:05:00] knowledge to puff you up and make you a
[1:05:02] knowit-all.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; if you ab let me tell you, if you absorb
[1:05:08] knowledge and get it and don't do it,
[1:05:12] you're worse off than the man who didn't
[1:05:14] get it.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:16] See, because you know Jesus, they they
[1:05:19] you know those lawyers, those Pharisees,
[1:05:21] Sadducees, they were they hate him so
[1:05:23] much. And you know, here he is, you
[1:05:25] know, uh way laying the church there of
[1:05:27] that day. And they said, and he said,
[1:05:29] "Oh, you're blind. You're blind leaders
[1:05:31] of the blind." And the dead walk over,
[1:05:33] they they don't even realize they're
[1:05:35] walking over graves. And they said, you
[1:05:37] know, "Are we blind also?" And here they
[1:05:39] are doctors of divinity. And they know
[1:05:42] he's a Galilean who has no formal
[1:05:44] education. So they think they got him.
[1:05:47] They weren't ready for his answer.
[1:05:50] Are we blind also? And Jesus says,
[1:05:54] "Well,
[1:05:56] if you were blind, then you'd have
[1:05:58] somewhat of an excuse.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; But because you say we see, your guilt
[1:06:04] remains."
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. See?
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; And so people who puff themselves up
[1:06:08] with knowledge, you're you don't realize
[1:06:10] that you're in a dangerous place to not
[1:06:13] let it live in you.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; so you and and and you you really at at
[1:06:20] only a knowledge level. That's why you
[1:06:22] cannot there there is no um endound on
[1:06:26] the new birth.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; There's no endound on the baptism of the
[1:06:30] Holy Ghost. You have to have an
[1:06:32] experience with God to bring that gene
[1:06:35] of God to life. He's the only one who
[1:06:38] can do it. Knowledge won't bring it to
[1:06:41] life. Knowledge helps it grow. Knowledge
[1:06:44] helps it understand the world. Helps it
[1:06:46] understand who it is because it it needs
[1:06:48] to know who it is because then it can do
[1:06:50] the greater works. But knowledge can't
[1:06:52] do that. It takes a supernatural fireb
[1:06:55] breathing experience of the God who's
[1:06:58] who gave you the seed. Hallelujah.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; You can't short circuit. It doesn't
[1:07:06] matter how long you sit in a message
[1:07:09] church.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Old Maize Jackson, I don't know if
[1:07:13] anybody ever used to hear the truckers
[1:07:15] truck driver special. Maize Jackson,
[1:07:17] man, I love that guy. And he used to he
[1:07:20] used to always say, "Friend,
[1:07:23] sitting in a church won't make you a
[1:07:25] Christian anymore than sitting in a
[1:07:27] garage will make you an automobile.
[1:07:32] I used to say, "Praise the Lord, brother
[1:07:34] Maize." Amen.
[1:07:37] [Music]
[1:07:39] Such warriors of the faith. Going to
[1:07:41] meet meet him some of these days.
[1:07:45] So,
[1:07:46] so this helps us then to explain the
[1:07:50] madness that we see in these two
[1:07:52] divergent realities
[1:07:55] uh between light and darkness, between
[1:07:58] ascending and descending as brother
[1:08:02] Brandham saw that in the preview of the
[1:08:04] bride. It's been famously said, I've
[1:08:07] tried like crazy to find exactly who
[1:08:09] said it. uh doesn't I couldn't find it
[1:08:12] and it doesn't matter because Jesus
[1:08:14] actually is the one who first taught it
[1:08:16] but they this author didn't give him
[1:08:18] credit so I'll go ahead and give him
[1:08:20] credit and and this author whoever he
[1:08:23] may be said there is no darkness like
[1:08:27] the one when the light that once was has
[1:08:29] gone out
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; and Jesus taught that that that you know
[1:08:34] that there's a light inside you and and
[1:08:36] if that light goes out Jesus says how
[1:08:38] dark is that
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; because It's now darker than it was. You
[1:08:42] had been better off to never have heard
[1:08:44] the light. See, to not allow your life
[1:08:47] to say amen to it. So, so as we say now,
[1:08:51] all right, so I've got you in that in
[1:08:53] that thinking. You're understanding.
[1:08:54] You're we're on the same page. It's all
[1:08:57] about going forward. It's all about God
[1:08:59] unfolding. You you're not just here
[1:09:01] passing time.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; See, because the millennium's still in
[1:09:07] time. You're not escaping time going in
[1:09:08] the rapture,
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; You're not going to escape time. It's
[1:09:12] still going on all the way into the
[1:09:13] millennium for a thousand years, 10
[1:09:15] centuries. See?
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; So, so it's not about passing up time
[1:09:21] and getting to, you know, this
[1:09:22] achievement or that achievement. It's
[1:09:24] about my life becoming an unfolding
[1:09:28] event in modern history according to
[1:09:30] prophecy.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And because of that, we don't
[1:09:34] always understand why our life goes the
[1:09:36] way it does. And I just want to say to
[1:09:38] you today, that's not because you're
[1:09:40] illiterate. It's because sometimes you
[1:09:42] just don't know.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; And you and things are unfolding in your
[1:09:46] life that you cannot put a logical
[1:09:48] explanation to. Job ran into that exact
[1:09:51] same problem. Job could rationalize it.
[1:09:53] He was a sensible man. He said, 'You
[1:09:55] know, if I if I had cheated a man of his
[1:09:58] wages, if I had taken a maiden in the
[1:10:01] field against her will, if I had done
[1:10:03] this or done that, he said, then I could
[1:10:04] understand, but I'm innocent of these
[1:10:06] things. I've done none of these things.
[1:10:08] But but but Job, you know, he's um and
[1:10:11] finally God comes down and who is this
[1:10:13] and filling the air with these dark
[1:10:14] sayings and somebody that talks like
[1:10:16] they know what they're talking about and
[1:10:17] don't even know nothing.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; And and he he talks about, you know, can
[1:10:21] you take polites by the tail? Can you
[1:10:23] handle this one? Can you do that? Do you
[1:10:25] have store rooms of treasure like I have
[1:10:27] of hail saved up for the day of
[1:10:29] judgment?
[1:10:31] Did Did you fashion the corners of the
[1:10:33] earth? Tell me if you did that so I can
[1:10:35] I'd like to know.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; And Job put his hand over his mouth and
[1:10:38] he said, "I just know nothing. I spoke
[1:10:40] of things I didn't even understand." So
[1:10:43] let me tell you what to say, friends. No
[1:10:45] matter what life throws at you, just in
[1:10:47] all things give God glory. In all
[1:10:49] things, praise the Lord. He's got you.
[1:10:52] He's got this. He knows what he's doing.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; So, so then it, so then when we go
[1:11:01] beyond Malachi 4 and then we go beyond
[1:11:05] 18, Revelation 18:4, those things are h
[1:11:08] have been fulfilled and are in
[1:11:10] fulfillment. The the shout, the voice,
[1:11:12] the trumpet, the shout is still going
[1:11:14] on. Now, we don't have a prophet here,
[1:11:15] and I don't need an eighth messenger to
[1:11:17] go back and re-shout.
[1:11:19] But you understand, we're still
[1:11:21] spreading books and we're still
[1:11:22] spreading tapes and and and I just saw a
[1:11:24] video the other day uh that brother
[1:11:26] Barry that this church uh participates
[1:11:28] in supporting in that vision vision
[1:11:30] books program. Uh and and here's this
[1:11:33] African church in the middle of who
[1:11:35] knows where. And the believers are just
[1:11:37] rejoicing as they're getting their hands
[1:11:39] on a seal book in their own language.
[1:11:42] That's something you take for granted to
[1:11:43] them. It was the greatest treasure.
[1:11:45] They're being handed a Bible. They've
[1:11:47] never had a Bible. and been a believer
[1:11:49] for decades.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; And we worry when our toaster doesn't
[1:11:54] work.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; And we worry if our if our car misfires
[1:12:00] a little bit. I I worry like crazy over
[1:12:02] stuff like that.
[1:12:05] Help us, Lord. Yeah.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; So, so but it's still shouting and and
[1:12:11] we're and we're certainly well into the
[1:12:13] voice uh uh you know of the resurrection
[1:12:16] that is living inside of a bride. You're
[1:12:18] you're the final voice and you're you're
[1:12:20] you're you're a voice of a lived life
[1:12:23] because you heard a shout and you
[1:12:24] responded. You heard you recognized and
[1:12:27] you acted. And that's what you're doing
[1:12:28] here today. You're acting upon the word
[1:12:30] of God.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; So, it's all about a forward progress.
[1:12:35] So, you know, Jesus talked about, you
[1:12:38] know, the this hidden mystery that was
[1:12:41] wrapped up and shrouded in mystery in
[1:12:43] Luke 17, referring to the ministry of
[1:12:46] the son of man. And that is an unfolding
[1:12:50] mystery that Jesus himself
[1:12:54] declared with his life long before he
[1:12:56] ever said it. And Luke wrote it in a
[1:12:59] Bible or Matthew or Mark wrote wrote
[1:13:02] those events in a Bible. Jesus was only
[1:13:05] saying what he was already showing that
[1:13:08] he was an active ministry of the son of
[1:13:12] man.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; See, so
[1:13:17] you know, you remember brother Brandon
[1:13:19] would say Jesus never claimed to be the
[1:13:21] son of God. He claimed to be the son of
[1:13:23] man.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; And so, so this is exactly why when
[1:13:28] they're taking up stones to stone him
[1:13:30] and for which of my good works? not for
[1:13:32] any of your good works, but because you
[1:13:34] being a man, make yourself God." So now
[1:13:37] they're they're not they're not just
[1:13:39] they're not, you know, it's it was not a
[1:13:42] stonable offense. Adam had been called
[1:13:44] the son of God.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Solomon had been called a son of God.
[1:13:49] That wasn't the problem. But Daniel in
[1:13:51] Daniel 12 had prophesied that one like
[1:13:54] unto the son of man will come with the
[1:13:56] clouds of heaven and he'll come forward
[1:13:58] and receive an authority and a dominion
[1:14:01] and his kingdom will never pass away.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; And so when that's what they're coming
[1:14:06] after him. That's why in the book of
[1:14:08] Mark when the high priest comes down and
[1:14:10] just says now tell us plainly are you
[1:14:13] the son of the blessed one? And Jesus
[1:14:16] said, "I am, and you shall see the
[1:14:18] clouds of heaven, and you shall see
[1:14:20] these things." And he tore his garment.
[1:14:22] He said, "What further need do we have?"
[1:14:24] So listen, let me tell you something,
[1:14:25] friends. It's not so much that you say,
[1:14:27] "I'm a son or daughter of God, but I am
[1:14:30] the word made flesh in this hour."
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; See, and this is what Jesus was
[1:14:37] revealing. And that ministry was going
[1:14:39] to carry on into the church. That's what
[1:14:42] the Holy Ghost was given for.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:46] The Holy Ghost comes to make you the
[1:14:50] word made flesh.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Say, how does that work? Do you have a
[1:14:54] seed, gene? Is that the word? Does that
[1:14:58] influence your flesh?
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Then you're the word made flesh.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; You're still got to have a body change,
[1:15:04] but you're you're inside man is already
[1:15:07] living in heavenly places with Christ
[1:15:09] Jesus. And you are the unfolding event
[1:15:13] in modern history made clear by
[1:15:15] prophecy.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; It's an unfolding mystery that Jesus had
[1:15:20] declared in his life in in Luke 17 where
[1:15:24] he speaks about the coming days of Noah
[1:15:27] and the coming days of Lot and the end
[1:15:30] of the world. And he goes on there, you
[1:15:32] know, and and describes some more of it
[1:15:34] in uh in in Matthew's gospel, Matthew
[1:15:37] 24.
[1:15:38] So, you know, people sometimes they say,
[1:15:42] you know, why would you call it a
[1:15:43] mystery? Why would you call Jesus a
[1:15:46] mystery? Well, did the Jews know who he
[1:15:50] was?
[1:15:53] Did Israel recognize their king?
[1:15:56] He rode in on a donkey just like the
[1:15:58] scripture had said. And they shouted,
[1:16:01] "Hosana, hosana," which means save us.
[1:16:03] And they're asking him, "Will you now
[1:16:05] restore the kingdom?" So, but but he's
[1:16:07] got a few disciples, but he's got he,
[1:16:11] you know, he had he had thousands, then
[1:16:13] he's got 70, then he's got 12, and one
[1:16:16] of them was a devil.
[1:16:19] So, I I I would say that yes, he's
[1:16:22] walking around in human flesh, but he's
[1:16:24] still quite the mystery.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus prophesied that the mystery of
[1:16:29] what he was would continue in his church
[1:16:34] at Pentecost. Now, and he said that he
[1:16:37] he told them, "Go and tarry until you be
[1:16:41] endued with power. Then you'll be a
[1:16:43] witness to me."
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; See, so so the ministry of the son of
[1:16:47] man, it a little while the world won't
[1:16:49] see me, but you'll see me because when
[1:16:52] people see you, they'll see me cuz I'll
[1:16:54] be living in and through you. See? So
[1:16:57] we're I'm not when I came here today, I
[1:16:59] was not expecting to look out in these
[1:17:03] seats and see the nail scarred man.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; What I expected to see was people who
[1:17:09] believe in the nail scarred man who have
[1:17:11] accepted the life that was in him is now
[1:17:13] in them.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; And therefore you are, you understand
[1:17:16] this is all about god going forward,
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; making the next modern event, the next
[1:17:22] modern event, the next modern event. And
[1:17:24] the last event is this bride leaving the
[1:17:26] earth.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; And then he has another event for the
[1:17:30] 144,000. And then he has another event
[1:17:32] when we come back in Revelation 19. And
[1:17:34] then he has another event when we step
[1:17:36] out on the ashes of the wicked.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; He has another event a thousand years
[1:17:40] later of a new heavens and a new earth.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; And then he has immeasurable events as
[1:17:45] the as the hidden mana and his mystery
[1:17:48] continues to unfold through the
[1:17:50] ceaseless ages.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:54] So he prophesied to them that this same
[1:17:58] mystery
[1:18:02] would continue in his church.
[1:18:04] And when that occurred,
[1:18:08] was it still a mystery? Of course.
[1:18:11] Of course it was. Were Were Were Were
[1:18:13] Were Were Were Were Were Were Were were
[1:18:15] W were W were were W were W were were W
[1:18:15] were W were were W were W were were W
[1:18:15] were W were were W were W were were W
[1:18:15] were W were were W were W were were
[1:18:15] those 120 suddenly recognized as God's
[1:18:19] mouthpiece to the earth?
[1:18:22] No. Uh, everybody thought they were
[1:18:24] drunk.
[1:18:26] Oh, the people were just full of new
[1:18:28] wine. And so, so they they weren't
[1:18:31] recognized as God's mouthpiece to the
[1:18:34] world, but that's what they were.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; See, so so so these these men who are
[1:18:41] devout Jews and you know, and and and
[1:18:45] think, "Oh, you're full of new wine."
[1:18:47] according to Acts 2:13.
[1:18:50] So what did they have to have happen
[1:18:55] to to catch the mystery?
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; so Peter Peter when he comes out and and
[1:19:04] and he's going to preach to them the
[1:19:07] message of that hour.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Now stay with me. He's going to preach
[1:19:13] to them the message of that hour. And
[1:19:17] then the Holy Spirit would then have to
[1:19:21] quicken and give them the understanding
[1:19:25] of true repentance so they could do it.
[1:19:28] So they could become it.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; So they could manifest it. So now they
[1:19:32] the need is they already follow the law
[1:19:36] of Moses. They're already devout people.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; They're not whoreongers and drunkards.
[1:19:41] They're devout people already, but they
[1:19:43] need to take the next step. They need to
[1:19:46] become the word made flesh. They need to
[1:19:48] become the ministry of the son of man.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; How are they going to do that? What's
[1:19:51] going to convince them? Peter has to
[1:19:54] preach to them the message of the hour.
[1:19:56] And then the holy spirit has to give
[1:19:58] them an understanding so that they can
[1:20:01] have a spirit of true repentance. So
[1:20:03] what message did he did he preach to
[1:20:06] them? Uh what was the message of that
[1:20:10] hour? That Christ is risen. No, that had
[1:20:14] been being preached for 40 days.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; And now 10 days later,
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; there's still only 120 people who
[1:20:21] believe it in the whole world.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; You You follow me?
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; See, so that's not what Peter That's not
[1:20:32] what Peter would preach to them. That
[1:20:34] had already been being preached. And now
[1:20:37] 10 days later, you still only got 120
[1:20:40] people who are believing uh the the the
[1:20:42] the message of the hour. The message of
[1:20:45] the hour is not he just he died at
[1:20:48] Calvary. The message of the hour, you
[1:20:50] remember when he said that I go to the
[1:20:52] father and then we will come to you.
[1:20:54] This is it.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; What's the message of the hour? That he
[1:20:58] kept his promise and he's living inside
[1:21:00] of us.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; He didn't go back and say the lamb of
[1:21:03] God hung on a cross, but he took them to
[1:21:06] Joel's prophecy and said, "This is that
[1:21:09] which was spoken by the prophet Joel."
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; This is not Isaiah that you're seeing
[1:21:15] where he went as a sheep led to the
[1:21:17] slaughter and they pierced his side and
[1:21:19] he looked upon them. That has been
[1:21:21] fulfilled. Now he has walked forward
[1:21:24] some more and now he's living in us and
[1:21:27] he wants to live in you.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:31] See?
[1:21:33] All right.
[1:21:36] Let me have my PowerPoint, Brother
[1:21:38] Kevin.
[1:21:41] All right. So, here's what he comes
[1:21:44] preaching.
[1:21:47] But on the day, this is the day of
[1:21:48] Pentecost.
[1:21:50] So, but but this is that which was
[1:21:54] spoken by the prophet Joel. And it shall
[1:21:57] come to pass in the last days, see the
[1:22:00] last days, plural, the last 2,000 years,
[1:22:03] 1,000 years is a day with the Lord.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; See, here's what's happening in the New
[1:22:08] Testament era. I will pour out of my
[1:22:11] spirit upon all flesh.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice something that
[1:22:17] I personally had never caught until I
[1:22:19] was looking at it this morning. You, it
[1:22:21] might be hard for you to imagine
[1:22:22] preaching all these years and never
[1:22:24] caught this. But if you'll notice, I
[1:22:27] will pour out of my spirit.
[1:22:31] And we always quote it because when you
[1:22:33] quote Joel, it's I will pour out my
[1:22:35] spirit upon all flesh. But when Peter is
[1:22:39] now a new kind of manifestation, he's
[1:22:42] not going to just go back and say where
[1:22:45] what he said there in Joel's prophecy, I
[1:22:48] will pour out my spirit upon all flesh.
[1:22:51] Because Peter now knows that that that
[1:22:54] that that there's a further mystery
[1:22:56] unfolding that it's not just going to be
[1:22:58] God living alone or Jesus walking alone.
[1:23:02] And it's not that God is going to come
[1:23:04] down and somehow divide himself into
[1:23:07] multiple persons.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; That's that's how the trinity came. And
[1:23:11] brother Brandham said he divided
[1:23:13] himself. But what Peter's making clear
[1:23:15] is that it's not, you know, he'd said to
[1:23:17] Job, he'd said to Job, "Have you seen my
[1:23:20] storooms? Have you seen the hail that I
[1:23:22] have saved up for the last day? This is
[1:23:25] not some extraneous thing that God was
[1:23:27] going to take out of a store room and
[1:23:29] give it to his people. What was going to
[1:23:31] happen is he was going to come down
[1:23:33] himself and I'm not going to give you
[1:23:35] something uh uh uh that that I own. It's
[1:23:38] in a store room. I'm going to give you
[1:23:40] something of me. I'm going to divide
[1:23:42] part of myself into you. And that's why
[1:23:46] Peter is now trying to get them to
[1:23:47] understand this is Christ in you, the
[1:23:50] hope of glory.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; so he's making it very personal.
[1:23:58] God is making this very personal. This
[1:24:00] isn't just some gift.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; This isn't out of one of my storooms.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; This is not some extraneous thing. This
[1:24:08] is actually I'm going to live inside
[1:24:12] you.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. See
[1:24:15] now, so so then so then we find then
[1:24:19] that Peter
[1:24:22] has has has has the promise
[1:24:26] more
[1:24:28] Peter says later we have a more sure
[1:24:32] word of prophecy
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; and you do well to believe that and go
[1:24:36] and and follow that.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; So what does that simply mean? That's
[1:24:40] that's a a a Greek way of saying we have
[1:24:44] the prophecy made more certain.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; It is sherer to us because now we have
[1:24:52] lived it.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Joel prophesied it.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; But I have a more sure word of prophecy
[1:24:59] than Joel had. I'm I am that prophecy.
[1:25:03] It has now come to pass. And and and
[1:25:06] this is what separates the bride of
[1:25:08] Christ from just people who believe the
[1:25:11] promises of the Bible.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; They stay promises until they live
[1:25:16] behind your skin. And so this is what
[1:25:18] separates the one who's born again who
[1:25:21] has the faith of the son of God versus
[1:25:24] someone who has a limited faith in the
[1:25:26] son of God.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; The Christian world has a faith in the
[1:25:29] son of God. But you were promised the
[1:25:32] faith of the son of God. Amen.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; See, I I know this is this is a little
[1:25:40] bit mindbending, but just stay with me.
[1:25:42] See,
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; so,
[1:25:47] and I want to say I I just want to make
[1:25:49] this statement that, and I'm
[1:25:54] to my fellow student linguist, I'm going
[1:25:56] to have to slaughter the king's English
[1:25:58] somewhat today. It's the only way we're
[1:26:00] going to be able to get it.
[1:26:03] But
[1:26:07] brother Brandham started it, by the way.
[1:26:10] Called him the God man.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Called him man plus,
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; See, brand new type of human. He's a
[1:26:17] prototype for what's the the whole
[1:26:18] kingdom's going to be. See, so brother
[1:26:21] Brandham, you know, when he says God
[1:26:23] divided himself, all that he was, he
[1:26:25] poured into Christ. And all that Christ
[1:26:26] was, he poured into the church. So,
[1:26:29] brother Brandon would use the the the
[1:26:31] idea of the ocean. And he said, "You
[1:26:33] take a spoon and you dip it in the
[1:26:35] ocean." Now, you do not have the ocean,
[1:26:36] but you have everything, every element
[1:26:38] of the ocean in your spoon.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; So, he he says, "You have it by measure.
[1:26:43] He had it. Christ had it without
[1:26:44] measure."
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; So, he was the fullness of the Godhead
[1:26:48] bodily. And yet, he was a human being. I
[1:26:51] mean, you know, the the the fact that
[1:26:53] the fact that he could die and be killed
[1:26:57] and be buried proved he was a man.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; But the fact that he could raise him,
[1:27:04] that body could raise itself up under
[1:27:06] its own power
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; proved he was more than a man.
[1:27:12] See,
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; so when he when he divides himself into
[1:27:17] that church,
[1:27:20] only the paradox
[1:27:23] that is God
[1:27:25] could divide himself
[1:27:27] and rather than becoming something less,
[1:27:31] he becomes something more.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; That's paradoxical. How does something
[1:27:37] divide and not be diminished? Right?
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; If I break my pen in half and hand it to
[1:27:42] you, you don't have the whole pen. And
[1:27:44] now my pen is diminished. It's in two
[1:27:46] halves. But God actually could divide
[1:27:49] himself and not be diminished
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; at all. And in fact, just the opposite,
[1:27:55] he can become more. See not a second
[1:27:59] god, a third god, a fourth god, you
[1:28:02] know, in in India 33 I think million
[1:28:05] different gods but he was the same god
[1:28:08] dividing because he did not pour he did
[1:28:14] not pour
[1:28:16] everything in you like he did in Christ
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; but everything he poured in you is the
[1:28:23] element of what he poured in Christ
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; only it's now in a many membered body
[1:28:27] and that's the ministry of the son of
[1:28:29] man. You are an unfolding mystery and
[1:28:32] the world thinks it's a cult because
[1:28:34] it's a mystery
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; and the only way you can get your that
[1:28:38] you you can get your mind around it is a
[1:28:40] studious reading of the word. But then
[1:28:42] even after that, just like those men on
[1:28:45] the day of Pentecost, he couldn't preach
[1:28:47] Isaiah's message. He had to preach
[1:28:49] Joel's message.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; And when they heard that, they were
[1:28:54] pricricked in their hearts. Now he can
[1:28:56] make a circle and come back around to
[1:28:58] Jesus. Now, this Jesus whom you
[1:29:00] crucified. However, I know you did it by
[1:29:03] determined counsel. You did it through
[1:29:05] misinterpreted theology. I know you're
[1:29:08] devout men, but but those sacrifices are
[1:29:10] no good anymore. Paul would tell him
[1:29:12] that later in Acts 17. He winked at your
[1:29:15] ignorance. 1600 years of law. He was
[1:29:18] never going to keep that. And and all
[1:29:20] you have to do is think it through. If
[1:29:22] if if that blood of bulls and goats
[1:29:24] could perfect you, why' the high priest
[1:29:25] have to offer it every year?
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. But I'm here to tell you,
[1:29:29] there was a lamb offered on your behalf.
[1:29:31] And it's good this year, next year, and
[1:29:33] every year afterward.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; And you don't have to get reborn again
[1:29:37] every single time you come to church.
[1:29:38] You just get a refilling. You get a you
[1:29:41] get some energy. You get some cleaning.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; And you could never not be a part of
[1:29:48] God.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:50] So every time he goes forward revealing
[1:29:53] himself, he becomes greater
[1:29:56] just as he had said to the church,
[1:29:59] greater than this shall you do because I
[1:30:02] go to the father. That's what they said,
[1:30:04] you know, we want to make you king.
[1:30:06] You're not going to go. He said, if I
[1:30:08] don't go, he won't come.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; He's not talking about a different
[1:30:12] person. He's saying if I stay in this
[1:30:15] body and you make me a king, I'm just a
[1:30:18] mortal man who's aging.
[1:30:20] I can get sick. I age. My body's built
[1:30:23] out of the cursed earth. But but if you
[1:30:25] if you leave me, let me go. The cup my
[1:30:28] father has given me. Shall I not drink
[1:30:30] it? And if I drink it, don't worry. I'll
[1:30:34] raise myself back up again. I'll step
[1:30:36] into sin for you. That's what Adam got
[1:30:39] trapped. When Adam tried to step into
[1:30:41] sin to save Eve, he himself got trapped.
[1:30:43] But I'm thankful that Jesus stepped into
[1:30:46] death and stepped and went to hell and
[1:30:48] then stepped back out of it again and
[1:30:50] pulled all the saints of God with him.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; So, so brother Brandon would say, I used
[1:31:01] to believe
[1:31:02] that when he would say, "Greater than
[1:31:05] this shall you do,"
[1:31:09] he said, "I thought it just meant more."
[1:31:11] Right.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; And the reason he thought that is
[1:31:14] because it does mean more
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; because now Jesus, brother Brandon would
[1:31:17] say, Jesus Christ has had more success
[1:31:20] in one of my meetings than he had the
[1:31:22] than are that are recorded in all the
[1:31:24] New Testament gospels. Now granted, John
[1:31:26] said if everything he did, the books
[1:31:28] couldn't hold and I get all that. But
[1:31:30] but what is recorded, he said he's had
[1:31:32] more miracles and greater success in one
[1:31:34] of my meetings than are recorded. You
[1:31:36] could take all the incidents that are
[1:31:38] recorded in the gospel and put them all
[1:31:39] together. And one of my services would
[1:31:41] produce more miracles than that.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Including the dead being raised up at
[1:31:45] multiple levels
[1:31:47] and and demons being cast out and the
[1:31:49] blind eyes opening and the sick and the
[1:31:51] lame walking and leaping and jumping and
[1:31:53] cancers dying and and and this thing
[1:31:56] wasn't done in a corner.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; And he's he's not saying I got glory.
[1:32:00] He's saying he got more glory. Amen.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; and so what was God doing? God was
[1:32:07] fulfilling Luke 17:30, Malachi 4,
[1:32:11] Revelation 18. He's showing the ministry
[1:32:15] of the son of man again that can know
[1:32:18] the secrets of the heart.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:32:23] so every time he goes forward
[1:32:26] revealing, and brother Brandham said, I
[1:32:28] always thought it just meant more. He
[1:32:30] said, "But it occurred to me that when
[1:32:33] he said in the woods the other day, say
[1:32:36] where those squirrels will be."
[1:32:39] And he said, "They were created out of
[1:32:42] nothing."
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Now, that's Genesis power.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Now, you're all the way back in the
[1:32:49] beginning, God said, "Let there be." And
[1:32:51] he said, "Say where there'll be."
[1:32:53] Because brother Brandon wouldn't preach
[1:32:55] on that scripture. If you say to this
[1:32:57] mountain, he said, "I could not. I did.
[1:32:59] I just wouldn't preach on it because I
[1:33:00] didn't understand how could if I say to
[1:33:03] the mountain. Now I could get it if he
[1:33:04] could say it. But how who am I? I'm just
[1:33:06] a sinful man. And William Brandham knew
[1:33:08] of his own his own weaknesses just like
[1:33:10] you and I. We got some, don't we?
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; See?
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus was tempted in every way. But he
[1:33:16] never sinned one time. He always did
[1:33:18] that which pleased the father. See,
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; and so he did that on your behalf. And
[1:33:23] that's why you get credit for his
[1:33:26] perfect life and go to heaven. He gets
[1:33:29] credit for your sinful life and got sent
[1:33:30] to hell.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Now, who do you love?
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; he died and brother Brandham said God
[1:33:41] condemned him as a sinner and he'd never
[1:33:43] committed a sin, but he took your sin
[1:33:46] and God condemned him as a sinner and
[1:33:48] sent him to hell. You know why God did
[1:33:49] that? So I would never have to go there.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; So you would never have to go there. Now
[1:33:55] he has ascended on high and and brother
[1:33:58] Brandham said when he stepped out of the
[1:33:59] eternities to claim the book and open
[1:34:02] loose the seals and open the book which
[1:34:03] is the mystery of himself revealed in
[1:34:05] his church. It's the the the the mystery
[1:34:08] the book is Christ. We were showing you
[1:34:10] that last week. Don't think of a
[1:34:11] leatherbound book. Not denying a record
[1:34:13] in heaven. I'm just saying that brother
[1:34:15] Brandham said he broke those seals off
[1:34:17] of himself. Another place he broke those
[1:34:19] seals out of himself. So, it's a
[1:34:22] continuing revelation, a continuing
[1:34:24] unfolding. And when the seals were
[1:34:26] opened, it didn't just reveal that he
[1:34:28] was three. It didn't just reveal that he
[1:34:30] was just Jesus only. It revealed that he
[1:34:33] was with his family and that there was a
[1:34:36] Mr. Jesus and a Mrs. Jesus and she's
[1:34:38] always been there. And now he calls for
[1:34:41] his queen
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; to stand by his side.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Friends, that's not just knowledge to
[1:34:47] puff you up. That's what you'll use to
[1:34:49] face the devil tomorrow. That's what
[1:34:51] you'll use when your child has got a
[1:34:53] fever. That's what you'll use when
[1:34:54] marriage, your marriage is in trouble.
[1:34:56] He has called for his queen to stand by
[1:34:59] his side and take the authority of the
[1:35:01] word and begin to speak it and create
[1:35:04] another modern event made clear.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; If your marriage is an event that's bad,
[1:35:10] create a new one.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Don't go get another partner. Use the
[1:35:14] word to fix the one you got and become
[1:35:17] more than you've ever been in your life.
[1:35:19] Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; There's power in prayer. There's power
[1:35:24] in the blood. There's power in the word.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Satan is deathly afraid you'll believe
[1:35:29] that.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Cuz he knows if you believe it and start
[1:35:33] exercising it, he's whooped.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said you'll defeat him
[1:35:39] just like Jesus thwarted his every move
[1:35:42] in the wilderness
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; because you're the final voice to the
[1:35:46] final age.
[1:35:49] So, so it's not only more, but it's
[1:35:53] greater. It's not only greater by doing
[1:35:57] more, but you know that you know more
[1:36:01] than this shall you do. It's not just a
[1:36:03] number, but it's actually things that
[1:36:06] are greater than even he did.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; See, and that makes perfect sense to me.
[1:36:12] All right. So,
[1:36:14] so, so it's it's both more and it's
[1:36:17] greater, which means that it should take
[1:36:20] all the wonder out of our minds that he
[1:36:23] is the how he is the hidden mana
[1:36:27] that in the ceaseless ages will unfold
[1:36:30] as an eternal revelation.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Brother R said, that's the future
[1:36:35] partaking of the hidden mana. It'll be
[1:36:37] the eternal unfolding of the mystery of
[1:36:39] God through the ceaseless ages to come.
[1:36:42] So it's the everinccreasing of his
[1:36:44] kingdom that that simply means it's the
[1:36:46] uncarchable riches of his person. And
[1:36:50] and as he's dividing himself more and
[1:36:53] more, he's going to keep dividing
[1:36:55] himself till the last name on the role
[1:36:58] is called. And when that has happened,
[1:37:00] then he's all in all he's got his
[1:37:02] gentile bride through seven ages ready.
[1:37:05] the dead in Christ that's been dead for
[1:37:07] hundreds of years will come out of the
[1:37:09] grave and stand in your living room one
[1:37:11] of these mornings
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; and then you will feel a little feeling
[1:37:15] a little pain like and brother Brandon
[1:37:17] said it's the last pain you'll ever feel
[1:37:20] in your life and you'll turn around and
[1:37:22] you'll be young and there's your loved
[1:37:24] ones gone and then onto the sky. Oh
[1:37:27] hallelujah.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; praise God.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; So it's an everinccreasing of his
[1:37:34] kingdom. See,
[1:37:37] it's why Paul said in Ephesians that I
[1:37:40] should preach among the Gentiles the
[1:37:43] uncarchable riches of Christ to make all
[1:37:46] men see what is the fellowship of the
[1:37:48] mystery which from the beginning of the
[1:37:51] world hath been hidden God who created
[1:37:54] all things by Jesus Christ. So what
[1:37:57] we're saying about Peter on the day of
[1:37:59] Pentecost
[1:38:01] is exact this perfectly agrees with
[1:38:05] Ezekiel. See, and and and and when you
[1:38:09] come to Ezekiel,
[1:38:11] a new heart also, Ezekiel 36, a new
[1:38:15] heart also will I give you, and a new
[1:38:19] spirit will I put within you, and I will
[1:38:23] take away the stony heart out of your
[1:38:25] flesh, and I will give you a heart of
[1:38:27] flesh, and I will put my spirit within
[1:38:33] you.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; So Peter wasn't wrong when he's
[1:38:37] interpreting Joel's prophecy. This is
[1:38:39] that that Joel said, "I'll pour out my
[1:38:42] spirit upon all flesh." See? And so
[1:38:45] Peter just adds a little of there. He's
[1:38:47] actually pouring out of his spirit. I
[1:38:50] It's actually making it personal. He's
[1:38:52] actually dividing himself
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; into you, but yet he's not diminished.
[1:38:58] This agrees perfectly with Isaiah 44
[1:39:01] and3.
[1:39:02] For I will pour water upon him that is
[1:39:05] thirsty and floods upon the dry ground.
[1:39:09] I will pour my spirit upon thy seed and
[1:39:14] my blessing upon thine offspring. I just
[1:39:18] want to go through the roof and land in
[1:39:20] the street. He's going to pour not only
[1:39:22] on me but on my seed and on my
[1:39:25] offspring. And they've been given to me
[1:39:27] and they've been given to you and I'm
[1:39:28] not going to give them back to the
[1:39:30] devil.
[1:39:31] Hallelujah.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:39:36] so you know th this this was to me this
[1:39:41] is what brought me back to Caleb.
[1:39:44] And I thought I kept thinking about that
[1:39:46] statement. I had to ask Jason because I
[1:39:48] was studying and I was listening at the
[1:39:49] same time. I didn't have time to write
[1:39:51] it down. So I texted him, Jay, what was
[1:39:53] that thing you that Paul was showing to
[1:39:55] the Corinthian church about loving
[1:39:56] others? You had a definition. He sent it
[1:39:58] a power. This is loving others. The real
[1:40:01] love, God's love,
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; not filio, not human affection. See,
[1:40:06] because human affection, you'll tell
[1:40:08] each other off if you somebody makes you
[1:40:10] mad.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; You sure will.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; If somebody crosses you up a little bit,
[1:40:18] you'll you'll get them on the phone and
[1:40:19] let them have it, then you're fine. And
[1:40:20] then they're destroyed.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Could I say today, stop being you and be
[1:40:26] him. Amen.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; I promise you as you, you will never get
[1:40:31] past that.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; I promise you as you, you'll constantly
[1:40:35] fight that and you'll get in your flesh
[1:40:37] and you'll harm one another. But to love
[1:40:39] others is a power. And we're not talking
[1:40:42] about now what you're limited to by your
[1:40:44] zodiac or by your raising or by your
[1:40:47] culture or by this or by that. The Holy
[1:40:49] Ghost is supposed to go all the way past
[1:40:51] that stuff.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; This what brother Joe was preaching to
[1:40:54] us Wednesday night. I thought that was
[1:40:56] one of the most profound sermons I ever
[1:40:57] heard. I said, "Brother Joe, I can tell
[1:40:59] you've been a pastor for a year and a
[1:41:00] half, and your ministry has migrated
[1:41:03] amazingly. I'm here to tell you
[1:41:04] something, friends. I want to be like
[1:41:06] him. I don't want to be like me."
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; A power or force to extend yourself for
[1:41:16] the purpose of spiritual growth. That's
[1:41:18] for others. You're when love projects,
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; grace takes over. Praise God.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; So this is why he said, you know, there
[1:41:29] are some people they were they truly
[1:41:32] were of the seedline of Abraham, but
[1:41:35] they were stiff necked. They were
[1:41:38] rebellious. They constantly tempted me
[1:41:40] these 10 times. They never would obey my
[1:41:42] word. And I'm just simply going to say
[1:41:45] they will never cross into the promised
[1:41:47] land. But I happened to notice one among
[1:41:49] them by the name of Caleb. And he had
[1:41:52] another kind of spirit.
[1:41:54] You think Caleb didn't run into the same
[1:41:57] offenses? They tried to kill the poor
[1:41:59] brother. They were going to stone him
[1:42:01] for real
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; in front of his family.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; But he kept a different spirit.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; They called him a liar. They called him
[1:42:11] a deceiver. They took they said, "Let's
[1:42:14] stone him."
[1:42:16] Did Caleb say, "Oh, well, let me tell
[1:42:18] you right now." No, he didn't. He
[1:42:20] didn't. He didn't. He didn't uh get on
[1:42:22] the phone. He didn't text him. He didn't
[1:42:23] Facebook him. He didn't do any of that
[1:42:25] stuff.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; He somehow he had a different spirit and
[1:42:28] God was watching.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; I hope you see it today. God is
[1:42:35] watching.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; He's watching. And if we're going to be
[1:42:41] the word made flesh, we're supposed to
[1:42:43] operate under a different kind of a
[1:42:45] spirit
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; than the world.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, locked you up. I'm sorry.
[1:42:56] Let me let me close with this. This
[1:42:58] meant a lot to me today.
[1:43:02] This is what
[1:43:06] you remember me telling you the story
[1:43:08] years ago
[1:43:10] and I preached about it. How that David
[1:43:14] looked out his window one day
[1:43:18] and he
[1:43:20] saw the the the house of God was just a
[1:43:23] tent.
[1:43:26] Worked fine in the wilderness.
[1:43:28] No time to build a structure.
[1:43:31] So they had him in a tent like the one
[1:43:33] that was in heaven.
[1:43:35] But now David had a desire. Something
[1:43:38] started happening in his heart. And he
[1:43:40] had a desire to build a house unto the
[1:43:43] Lord God. Now that what what that means
[1:43:46] is is I I I have a desire that there
[1:43:51] should be a place somewhere where a
[1:43:54] sinful man can go into and a holy God
[1:43:57] will come down to and he won't kill the
[1:44:00] man. The man won't die because of where
[1:44:03] he's at and God and man can be
[1:44:06] reconciled and the man can say, "I'm
[1:44:08] sorry, Lord. Forgive me of my sin." And
[1:44:11] God, if you're faithful, he's faithful
[1:44:14] and just if you confess to forgive. But
[1:44:16] there was no access for that man. And
[1:44:18] even if they had it back in that day,
[1:44:20] you couldn't go back there to the
[1:44:22] Shikina.
[1:44:24] Only a high priest once a year could
[1:44:25] even he could only go back there once.
[1:44:27] And then he had to have blood or even he
[1:44:29] would die. See?
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; So, so we realize then that David, what
[1:44:34] so what is David's desire all about? And
[1:44:36] the prophet says to him, "Do all that's
[1:44:39] in your heart cuz God is with you." See,
[1:44:41] the prophet even knew that that desire
[1:44:44] is godly. That something intrinsic in
[1:44:47] that prophet go doesn't record God come
[1:44:49] down and spoke to Nathan and showed him
[1:44:51] what was up. Nathan just from his spirit
[1:44:53] agreed with David's spirit and said,
[1:44:54] "Yeah, that's a great idea. God will
[1:44:57] bless something like that." You see,
[1:44:59] what they're what they're experiencing
[1:45:02] is a desire of God.
[1:45:04] and and David and Nathan says, "Go ahead
[1:45:07] and do it." Boy, later that night, God
[1:45:10] come to Nathan and said,"Now go back to
[1:45:12] David and tell him, you know, I I took
[1:45:16] you from among the sheep and I gave you
[1:45:19] a name like great men and I' I've
[1:45:21] blessed you and I did all of this.
[1:45:22] However, David, you you can't be the one
[1:45:25] to build the the the temple to me." And
[1:45:28] and you don't really find all the the
[1:45:30] whole all the reasons in one place. And
[1:45:32] the book of Kings doesn't show it all.
[1:45:34] You have to go it over into Ezra's
[1:45:35] writing of the Chronicles. Samuel
[1:45:37] doesn't talk about it a whole lot. Not
[1:45:38] in not in good enough detail to get the
[1:45:40] picture. Ezra covers it a little better
[1:45:43] and and says the reason David couldn't
[1:45:45] do it is because he he was a bloody man
[1:45:48] and his sword was wet with blood. And
[1:45:51] David had been a man of fierce judgment
[1:45:52] and anger. And David killed whole
[1:45:55] nations and wiped them out and destroyed
[1:45:57] people by the thousands. See? And so
[1:46:00] what is what is God saying? David's the
[1:46:02] father. David's in the fatherhood. God
[1:46:04] is saying, "David, you're that's my
[1:46:06] desire. I want to have a place, but I've
[1:46:09] been a god of judgment and a god of
[1:46:11] wrath and people who who wouldn't obey
[1:46:13] my word. I've slaughtered them. I hope
[1:46:14] opened up the earth and swallowed their
[1:46:16] them and their family and their cattle
[1:46:17] and their don donkeys and camels and I
[1:46:19] swallowed everything and and and I've
[1:46:21] and I've wiped out other nations. And so
[1:46:24] I even even I told Moses, I cannot go in
[1:46:27] the midst of these people. I'll slay
[1:46:29] them if I do. They're stiff necked.
[1:46:30] They're unbelievers. and I'll kill
[1:46:32] everybody, but I'll send forth my angel.
[1:46:34] See, it's the same God now in a form of
[1:46:37] atonement that he can go. I'll send
[1:46:38] forth my angel and he'll go among them.
[1:46:40] See, so God is simply saying through
[1:46:42] David, you're the father. I'm the
[1:46:45] father. You've been bloody. I've been
[1:46:47] bloody. You've been a killer. I've been
[1:46:48] a killer. You're about judgment. I'm
[1:46:50] about judgment. You want what I want. I
[1:46:53] want a place, too. You want a place to
[1:46:55] where me and you can come together. I
[1:46:56] want a place where I got cut off in the
[1:46:59] Garden of Eden. And I've always wanted
[1:47:00] to have another place. And starting with
[1:47:02] Abel, I've been building my way to it.
[1:47:05] Someday the lamb will hang on Calvary.
[1:47:08] You see, David, you can't do it. But
[1:47:10] I'll raise up your son and the son of
[1:47:13] David. And I'll call his name Solomon.
[1:47:16] I'll call his name peace. And in and in
[1:47:20] that son, I'll have reconciliation
[1:47:23] between God and man.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; See?
[1:47:28] So, so Christ can be that. He is the
[1:47:31] tabernacle in the wilderness. He is the
[1:47:33] temple Solomon built. He is the the the
[1:47:36] the meeting place where God and man can
[1:47:38] come together in fellowship.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; So, we're talking about the spirit of
[1:47:45] God and David
[1:47:48] after his dreadful
[1:47:52] sin with Bath Sheba. This is my last
[1:47:54] thing. You good?
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:58] after his failure with Ba Sheba.
[1:48:02] God sends Nathan the prophet back
[1:48:06] says, "Well,
[1:48:08] here's some decisions, David.
[1:48:10] The child is going to die.
[1:48:13] You'll get to see him again because
[1:48:14] he'll be in heaven. He won't come back
[1:48:17] to you, but you will eventually get to
[1:48:18] go to him."
[1:48:21] As for you and Ba Sheba,
[1:48:25] there really is no provision in the word
[1:48:29] to save you
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; because what you did was intentional and
[1:48:33] there's no sacrifice for that. You can't
[1:48:36] bring any There's no prescribed
[1:48:38] sacrifice for intentional
[1:48:39] transgressions.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; See, so there was no He couldn't go and
[1:48:44] offer a lamb. He couldn't offer bulock.
[1:48:45] He couldn't offer turtle dove. He
[1:48:47] couldn't do any of that. It wouldn't
[1:48:48] have atoned for it. There was only one
[1:48:50] paradoxical being who could make a who
[1:48:52] could make an executive decision and
[1:48:54] says, "But you will not die. She will
[1:48:57] not die. The offspring, the fruit of
[1:49:00] this will die, but then you'll get it
[1:49:02] back. But you'll not die because I am
[1:49:06] God and I have taken your sin and put it
[1:49:10] away from me."
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; And because I'm God, I can do that. And
[1:49:15] someday when when your son and my son,
[1:49:19] the son of David, the son of God, the
[1:49:21] son of man, hangs on Calvary, then all
[1:49:24] the you'll be in paradise until that
[1:49:26] happens, David. But when that happens,
[1:49:28] don't worry. I'll come knocking and
[1:49:31] Abraham will recognize me and Ezekiel
[1:49:33] recognize me and you'll recognize me and
[1:49:35] I'll empty you all out and we'll all go
[1:49:37] home and be done with all this nonsense.
[1:49:39] Oh, I'm so ready to be done with all
[1:49:41] this nonsense.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; So after that terrible,
[1:49:48] terrible transgression,
[1:49:50] David comes to the 51st Psalm.
[1:49:54] And here he is as a king on his knees.
[1:49:58] Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and
[1:50:03] renew a right spirit in me. Now just
[1:50:06] think about what's just happened. God
[1:50:08] just told him he's not going to die. Now
[1:50:09] he's coming back to God on his knees.
[1:50:12] Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and
[1:50:15] renew a right spirit within me.
[1:50:19] Cast me not away from thy presence. You
[1:50:23] love that. And take not thy holy spirit
[1:50:26] from me.
[1:50:28] Restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:50:32] salvation. Not my salvation, thy
[1:50:35] salvation. Yours is way better than
[1:50:37] mine.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:50:40] salvation.
[1:50:42] And I love this. And uphold me with thy
[1:50:46] free spirit. Why? Because you, like
[1:50:51] David, sometimes there's many times I
[1:50:55] can't uphold me. And I just have to say,
[1:50:58] Lord, uh, you uphold me. I can't uphold
[1:51:02] me. See? So, so, so what what what are
[1:51:05] you seeing? Just like when he wanted to
[1:51:06] build the tabern the temple, you're
[1:51:09] seeing a deep calling to a deep. There's
[1:51:13] something down inside of David. Brother
[1:51:15] Brandham said, "Like the noise of thy
[1:51:17] water spouts, the deep as the eagle
[1:51:20] flutterth over her young." And there's a
[1:51:22] deep calls to the deep. And he's saying
[1:51:25] to me, he's saying to God, "Create in me
[1:51:28] a clean heart. Take my heart which is
[1:51:31] deceitful above all things and and
[1:51:34] create me a new one. Lord, that's my
[1:51:37] desire. That's your desire. I say, Lord,
[1:51:40] my heart is deceitful. Create in me a
[1:51:42] clean heart.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Oh my. One with a different nature.
[1:51:48] One that will always believe the word.
[1:51:50] One that will always say amen to every
[1:51:53] word. And I'm not talking
[1:51:54] intellectually. I'm talking about Lord,
[1:51:56] I want you to create a heart in me that
[1:51:59] my life will go amen. Amen. Amen. My
[1:52:03] eyes will say amen. My ears will say
[1:52:06] amen. My feet will say amen. My whole
[1:52:09] life will be a living amen. That God can
[1:52:11] be proud of. How many want to pray that
[1:52:13] today? Lord created me. That kind of a
[1:52:16] heart today. And and and and cast me not
[1:52:21] away uh from thy presence. If I stumble,
[1:52:25] give me a heart that renews itself. Give
[1:52:27] me a right spirit again and again and
[1:52:30] again. You want to say that to the Lord?
[1:52:32] Create in me a clean heart and renew a
[1:52:34] right spirit. Something that comes back
[1:52:36] and says, "I'm sorry, and I love you,
[1:52:38] and I want to serve you, and it'll do it
[1:52:40] today, and it'll do it tomorrow, and
[1:52:42] it'll do it next week. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:52:45] Cast me not away from thy presence. I
[1:52:48] want a presence living in me that once I
[1:52:51] have it, I can never be cast away. No
[1:52:54] one can ever take it from me. I can
[1:52:56] never lose it.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And restore unto me the
[1:53:03] joy of thy salvation. One that when I
[1:53:07] stumble or make a mistake, not if, when,
[1:53:10] say, when. One that when I stumble or
[1:53:14] make a mistake, it will take me back to
[1:53:16] my knees again and again and again and
[1:53:21] still again. There's a deep inside
[1:53:24] presence of God that is calling
[1:53:26] continually, continually restoring the
[1:53:29] joy of his salvation to me.
[1:53:33] And this is the desire.
[1:53:36] This is the real desire that you can
[1:53:38] have today
[1:53:40] that David couldn't quite get to where
[1:53:43] you can be free from the law of sin.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Where the law of sin and death where the
[1:53:51] curse of sin and death have no more
[1:53:54] jurisdiction over my life.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Create in me a clean heart.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Oh God, come stand. Come musicians,
[1:54:05] stand to your feet.
[1:54:08] Create in me
[1:54:10] a clean heart, oh God,
[1:54:14] and renew a right spirit,
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; amen,
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; within me. Cast me not away from thy
[1:54:21] presence. Take not thy holy spirit from
[1:54:25] me. Restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:54:30] salvation
[1:54:33] and uphold me
[1:54:36] by thy free spirit.
[1:54:39] The spirit uphold me by the spirit that
[1:54:43] sets me free.
[1:54:45] Is that your desire today? I want you to
[1:54:48] bow your heads with me over the
[1:54:49] audience. I'm done preaching. We're
[1:54:52] going to let you go.
[1:54:55] But I I'd be daring to come come to a
[1:54:59] conclusion like that and not give you an
[1:55:02] opportunity today to say, "Lord, create
[1:55:05] in me a clean heart." Look at that.
[1:55:08] Hands everywhere. My
[1:55:11] renew a right spirit in me, Lord.
[1:55:15] This contaminating world
[1:55:19] has contaminated my spirit. Create in me
[1:55:22] a clean heart. Renew a right spirit in
[1:55:26] me. Cast me not away.
[1:55:30] Don't take your presence from me. Give
[1:55:33] me something that I once I have it, I
[1:55:35] can never ever lose it. No one can ever
[1:55:39] take it from me and uphold me by thy
[1:55:44] free spirit. Friends,
[1:55:47] while your heads are bowed now,
[1:55:53] if you and maybe your journey to become
[1:55:57] the unfolding mystery of God to the
[1:55:59] world and somehow you realize you got
[1:56:04] off the trail somewhere, you were
[1:56:06] supposed to be on a journey. You were
[1:56:08] supposed to be going forward. You were
[1:56:10] supposed to be ascending.
[1:56:12] And somehow you just feel like you've
[1:56:16] lagged behind and you want to say,
[1:56:19] "Lord, maybe I'm like those at the end
[1:56:20] of that line. I know I'm in an order of
[1:56:22] a descending.
[1:56:24] I know I'm not descending. I know I'm
[1:56:26] not part of the darkness. I know I'm
[1:56:29] getting closer to home, but I know I
[1:56:32] need to get back in line." Raise up that
[1:56:34] hand. Oh, there goes some honest hearts.
[1:56:36] My goodness. I'm gonna raise up both of
[1:56:38] mine. Lord Jesus, today
[1:56:42] I want to be part of that unfolding
[1:56:44] mystery.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; I want to be part of that ministry of
[1:56:48] the son of man that walks forward where
[1:56:50] everything in my life, everything I say
[1:56:52] and do, everything I think and believe
[1:56:56] will lead me to fulfilling your word.
[1:57:00] There's no value in me, Lord. I'm for
[1:57:02] sure I'm for sure going to fall. I'm for
[1:57:05] sure going to stumble. But I'm also for
[1:57:07] sure like my kinfolk, King David. And I
[1:57:11] want to say, create in me a clean heart
[1:57:12] today, Lord. Renew a right spirit in me,
[1:57:16] oh God. Let me get over myself. Let me
[1:57:19] get more like you. There's no value in
[1:57:22] being me. I want to be like you in
[1:57:26] everything I do, think, and say, in
[1:57:29] every way I respond. Lord, that sermon
[1:57:32] that your servant preached to us
[1:57:34] Wednesday night
[1:57:36] and then followed on closely by the
[1:57:38] Sunday school class today from our
[1:57:40] brother Jason. What a lesson putting
[1:57:42] those two sermons together. What a
[1:57:44] lesson, Lord.
[1:57:46] Oh, I want to be like you, oh God. I
[1:57:49] want to be like you, Lord Jesus. I I I'm
[1:57:53] like David.
[1:57:54] There's something inside me that's a
[1:57:57] deep is calling to a deep. The deep is
[1:58:00] higher than me and I want to be higher.
[1:58:02] Oh, may you grant it to us today. Lord,
[1:58:06] create in me a clean heart, Brother
[1:58:08] Kenny. Amen. Let's sing it. We know this
[1:58:10] song. It's a Bible song. Create in me a
[1:58:16] clean heart. Oh God.
[1:58:21] Oh
[1:58:23] God.
[1:58:24] [Music]
[1:58:27] Oh, and renew a right spirit
[1:58:32] within me.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Create in me.
[1:58:40] Create in me a clean heart.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:49] Oh
[1:58:51] God,
[1:58:54] [Music]
[1:58:55] and renew arise spirit
[1:59:00] within me.
[1:59:05] Come on, lift it up.
[1:59:08] Cast me not
[1:59:12] away
[1:59:13] from thy presence.
[1:59:18] Oh Lord.
[1:59:21] Oh, and take
[1:59:24] not thy holy
[1:59:27] spirit from me.
[1:59:32] Pray Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:59:35] Oh, restore
[1:59:39] to me
[1:59:41] all the joy of thy salvation.
[1:59:47] Grant, oh God, all over the building.
[1:59:52] Renew us, Lord.
[1:59:54] Renew us, oh God. Hallelujah. You're
[1:59:58] singing the word of God back to him.
[2:00:00] Created me. has created
[2:00:04] in me a clean heart.
[2:00:11] Oh
[2:00:13] God,
[2:00:17] oh and renew a right spirit
[2:00:22] within me.
[2:00:28] Grant it Lord in a real way. Create in
[2:00:32] me a clean heart
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; today, tomorrow, the next day, every
[2:00:41] day. Hallelujah. Is that your desire?
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; And renew a right spirit. My, how must
[2:00:49] that sound to the Lord? You're singing
[2:00:53] his word. Raise up those hands and lift
[2:00:57] your voices.
[2:00:58] Cast me not
[2:01:01] away from
[2:01:04] thy presence,
[2:01:08] oh Lord.
[2:01:10] Oh, and takes
