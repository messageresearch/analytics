life if you don't gain eternal life hey man we've made that point before there's that's the real value of being given life here so that you can acquire eternal life if you don't then life's really pointless and really barely worth living at all amen so we love the Lord we thank him for a wonderful spirit of worship here this morning God bless you all we've got a couple out sick and a number traveling we're going to go to prayer for them um asking the Lord to help them answer thank you [Music] please remember Michael Carter in prayer he's 35 years old Believer from Virginia that was diagnosed with liver cancer he goes back to Duke on January 19. for CT scans and MRI please help us pray that all will be well also um sister Phyllis has been communicating with me about her sister we've we put it in the ministry team chat for prayer um and the brothers have been praying for this need God is moving and uh it's a it's a little bit of an update here there's a lot to it I don't want to read it all this morning but there uh there's a prayer request for her surgery to come on Tuesday so it was real touch and go they didn't know what was wrong and so now they've they've managed to figure out what they believe it to be but my I'd love to see the great physician just touch her before Tuesday morning and this brother here and the different members of our family I see um I don't see Sister Amy I guess her and sister Mina still not feeling well this morning and uh brother Mark and sister Tabitha also in different ones but we're happy in the Lord praise God happy to have all of you here and some visitors amen still with us happy to have all of them praise the Lord that was some fine music this morning my I was in the back room trying to study it was so distracting but not really it actually had me just in the perfect frame of mind and so I I appreciate that I appreciate our visiting Brothers uh playing here with us Amen brother Hayden's brother here and different ones and so amen be careful brother because when we like somebody we tend to hang on to them so so what yeah watch out for that amen don't whatever you do don't let them take you to the beach and get sand between your toes that stuff is addictive and man it's like like a drug so don't don't do that or you'll mess up amen praise the Lord other visitors in our midst today amen happy to have our homeboys here enjoyed that song this morning amen and all the wonderful singing that we heard we're going to invite you uh to the word of God this morning if you'll find Daniel that's pretty easy to find and go two books over you're running right straight into the prophet Joel and so a lot of times those little small books are hard to locate and I don't want to put anybody in a panic so just find Daniel Amen that's a big one and go two books over you'll find the Book of Joel We want to read a prophecy quite relevant to us today and then I'll be praying over these uh various sickness needs um brother yeah oh I was pronouncing that Hayden I thought it was a t it's a d Hayden okay praise the Lord all right got that right now praise the Lord I like being right amen praise the Lord I want to speak to you today on the spirit of lawlessness amen first just uh just leaping into the new year how many are happy to be alive and well in the new year my I was uh I was looking through my morning devotionals early this morning and I and of all the ones uh you know I have a whole stack of them that I go through and and so I um oh you're a fired son wow you forgot to take up the offering amen oh okay it's Rusty brother Luther you put the basket in the back back there and you brother Brown said no Services complete without taking up an offering so we'll have it at the back and you can give uh to the Lord as you go out today amen praise the Lord um so brother I was reading and I come across the devotional for January 1 from Charles Spurgeon and you know I I'm guessing Charles brother Charles wrote that uh on December 31. because he's talking about how wonderful it'll be if tomorrow we get to go home and he was just saying the end of the year what if this was just the end of all of our troubles and trials and it was all done and we were we were headed home tomorrow wouldn't that be grand and and then he he kind of reflects you know to say well if it's not then we'll just carry on we'll just keep on going you know yeah that that's peace forevermore but we have the peace of God now amen so you know they're they're in that wonderful divine presence but we got that divine presence so if he so he he kind of almost in a Melancholy way said so if it's not and we have to carry on we'll just carry on I thought brother oh my I'm so encouraged by that today I woke up this morning and I was thanking God I said Lord you give me another opportunity another year to forge ahead and I want to be in that number Amen in that number when the redeemed go marching home I want to be in that number praise the Lord Joel chapter 2 we're going to catch verses 23 through 27. now I want to uh remind you and I want to for especially being a Sunday and and the streaming and different things and brother Matt will be uh Making a Splash a a an advertisement for it for our website and oh it's up very good son and uh it's announcing our meetings coming in March uh with brother Donnie so spread the word near and far and invite all your neighborhood bring them amen and so I'm trying I don't know if we can pull it off but I would love uh to bring the pastor from from um let's see what country is he from I think he's from um no uh where is what's what's Lagos the cap uh capital of Nigeria who okay um the capital of Nigeria and he's uh I think he's a pastor there in Nigeria and he's actually you may have heard of him he's actually a young pastor and he was the one you may have heard the story about he was actually kidnapped by by terrorists for ransom and held I think for more than a month and of course his family was poor and we uh brother brother Emmanuel ibruka that's his name and I got to see a snippet of his testimony wow I'll just say it backwards wow and this brother was so powerful in captivity those people never got money they finally had to let him go because they realized they had a man of God and so powerful was his testimony among them that half the team wanted to kill him and the other half said we'll kill you if you kill him and by the time it was all over one of the kidnappers or maybe one or more of them now is at his church wow I mean Satan kidnapped the wrong guy and they grabbed him after a Sunday morning I thought my I've never had to worry about leaving here on a Sunday morning after preaching and I get kidnapped and then and that's literally on his way home they nabbed him and uh he has an electrifying testimony that's just a little little preview and we're trying to see if I can bring him at the same time and uh if we do get him here to be up to the if we can get him visas and all that if we do then we'll start our meetings a day earlier than the announcement because I only had the inspiration for it this morning so we will instead of starting on the third we'll start on the second we'll bring him in and we'll let him kick it off and then also take a Saturday morning and let him give his full in-depth testimony to us and then we'll turn him loose to preach the first night and then let him give his testimony or vice versa however the Lord leads amen so uh but we're looking forward to that so pray will you and that the Lord will work that out it won't be as easy as it used to be governments have really tightened tightened up especially in this political environment that we live in today but my goodness I sure would I sure hope it can work amen to get brother Emmanuel here very very fine young Pastor so we're looking forward to that all right let's read in our text Joel chapter 2 verse 23 to 27. this this is going to amaze me that I'm going to read this with a title the spirit of lawlessness all right verse 23 be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former Reign moderately and will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month so there's a prophecy when the former and latter Reign were going to be brought in the same month close together all right and the floors here will be the result this is your day in case you need a helper with that this is your day and the floors shall be full of wheat the former and latter rain because the laodicean H was the shortest of all ages so the former and latter rain fall quickly together you got that it's bringing us to harvest how many are for Harvest all right um and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sin among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed in other words you're not I just want to give you some re some relief you're not going to be left holding the bag you're not going to get the short end of the stick just relax you'll never be ashamed you hold on and faith in the word God is sent believe on him whom God hath sent Among Us let me tell you something you you'll you'll have a great reward for it and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never repeats it shall never be ashamed father we thank you for your word this morning we ask for your Divine help now Lord there's much more and I I was having to take out whole swaths of my notes and put it to another time lord is just far too much to try to cover this morning sin we we want to we want to have it just laid out perfectly Lord trying to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit and I commit it all to you now in Jesus Christ name lord they're sick among us father some of our own congregation here battling sickness and virus we speak healing for them Lord there's requests that have come in Lord and family members in distant lands and States Lord and other brothers Lord from other places and sickness everywhere serious cases Lord many of them and I'm praying and asking father for your great Mercy on this request for the Brethren Virginia on Sister phyllis's Sister you've helped her before Lord help her again oh God for our brothers and sisters battling sickness and virus Lord I was having the Brethren on the call in today pray for this church specifically that this flu virus bug sickness whatever it is be done and be sent into outer Darkness Lord may it be so I pray Grant it now we ask these things of thee in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated I covet your prayers this morning I mean that quite earnestly because as I've said I've I've whittled it down and whittled it down to something that I believe that we can cover today hopefully um we'll be able to get to it all at least everything that I would like to be able to get to amen we'll leave it up to the Lord now when we let me just try to wade into this as best I can and and it's been quite amazing to me this morning because this is actually my second time ministering I ministered the morning bible study on our uh on our call-in show and I or call in Bible study that we have and I was ministering along the same lines not everything but a certain portion of this I was ministering it this morning so it that part I'm thankful is fresh in my mind our study of the entire Book of Revelation so we're going to correlate that this morning a little bit but also even as I was driving to church and all this is on my mind and I'm thinking about you know Christmas the Christmas message that we brought um the Sunday previous and that meant so much to me friends and you know I was I was trying to emphasize to you without going back I'd love to almost go back and preach that whole sermon again but you know the some of the main points were to bring you up to speed on the fact that the the kingdom of God is already being restored and that that's what the opening of The Seven Seals the releasing of the mystery of God I say what was the Seven Seals give it to me in a short in a short description that's easy to do it was the unveil failing of the Mighty God that's what it was he was hidden away as under a mystery and revealed piecemeal down through the ages of restoration the the church we know by the history fell away and we find certain little you can you can find certain little points in history to correlate the prophecy we find if we look at the at the messenger that we would refer to him as irenius and there's different ways to pronounce that name we'll use brother branham's way because I love Kentucky grammar and so but we find that brother Branham when he comes to iridius he gives us a little clue that irenius was the last messenger uh to understand the godhead perfectly he understood Paul's teaching on the godhead and when I say that we don't mean that just that there's one God we mean that there's God multiplied into his family we mean that there's a many membered parts of God's godhead amen and that it's not Jesus only but because that's why the Jesus only group was wrong because they didn't include his body in that but once you understand that God has revealed himself through expression then it starts to all come together and make sense then you don't get stumbled and trapped by the scriptures references to the humanity side of Jesus because he was a complete 100 percent man he wasn't half man and half God he wasn't a demigod so he wasn't half man half God he was fully man yet fully God which is a paradox that can't be but it is but and that's why it takes a revelation to understand it and the the the great strength of Revelation say I'd like to understand it we're not talking about understanding the details of the doctrine and trying to dot every eye because even even as ministers there's certain elements of it that we even kind of shake our head a little bit and go well you know but here here's the real secret that when you are born again of the spirit of God the Revelation that helps you to understand the godhead is the Revelation that helps you to know who you are and in knowing who you are you begin by Revelation to understand your relationship to the father then you begin to understand Jesus relationship to the father so he was the fullness of the godhead in a single body walking the shores of Galilee going about doing good but God never intended to stay bottled up like that and Jesus said except if they wanted to make him a king he said no that's the wrong plan unless I unless I die I won't multiply and multiplication has always been the plan God expressing himself and now it's the same God not in us not the fullness in a single Body by the fullness of the godhead in a many-membered body amen the body of Christ now spread around the world that's because because he understands it's got to be a kingdom of saints the kingdoms of this world mankind has had his run the spirit of lawlessness I'm here to tell you that God opened the seals to us and revealed the Mighty God which we see ourselves now in it amen that's what Christ is Mr God is all about that's what Masterpiece is all about amen that's what the unveiling of God is all about that's what the token is all about go back and listen to those that's those are things that brother Brandon began to bring to us after the opening of the seals to make it more clear see so when you when you find God interpreting his word let me just give you a couple of principles so when they came when Jesus walked the Earth what you're literally if you had been there with the disciples what you would have been seeing and could have said and you would have been accurate you could have said the the text in the Old Testament the text that was written and recorded by by the prophets and by scribes like Ezra who chronicled these things and great prophets who testified of what Christ would be that when Jesus came on the scene text had migrated to flesh you understand text had migrated to flesh it wasn't that we did away with the text it was that now we have an understanding in Christ of what all the prophets priests and kings were about it was as if they as if the the disciples could go ah now I get it they were still struggling on the road to Emmaus and Jesus started what'd he do he went back into the Old Testament and he began to show his life in the Old Testament coming forward and then he and what did he do he first opened to them the scriptures that's what a prophet did in the seals then he opened their understanding that's what's happening right now and then he opened their eyes and when your eyes come open the Saints are going to be standing around you and it's going to be over and we're going to be headed home oh that the text is going to become flesh again because Jesus in his life gave prophecy concerning the church and when the Holy Ghost came into the church a little while the world won't see me but you will I'll be with you even in you after a while and they wrote that down well that's good we better write that down well after a while that text became flesh see and then then what could then what did the church what what advantage did they now have they could now go and say you see you see this church here with all this power and signs and wonders this is this is what was recorded by our Lord he said this would happen just like Peter on the day of Pentecost when they they looked at their action and they said you're drunk he says no you misunderstand what you're seeing this is Joel's prophecy that in the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh this is what you're seeing that text has become human so now go to Paul's teaching in text to say oh don't you know don't worry that I know you're you're troubled over the Rapture but just let me tell you there's first got to be the Lawless one he's got to come and be exposed don't go thinking the rapture's already passed it hasn't happened yet because there's first got to come a falling away and and he goes down through all of these texts and today you're seeing that text in flesh in the world you're seeing the Lawless one in control of the world Paul's words have materialized well just keep following it because he said Don't Fear because the dead in Christ shall rise and we which are alive and remain shall be changed caught up in a moment in a twinkling I'm here to tell you that's going to become human Hallelujah and it can't help but become that because it's already underway we're all ready thank you sir we're already being transitioned the soul part of you is already sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I guarantee you you're guaranteed not to hear that in the in 99 of the Christian pulpits around the world I tell you if you want to hear something like that and understand God's plan for you that's why God sent a prophet and brought a message and broke the seals and loosed the mystery of Christ and gives your Revelation that you're part of that and I know it's happening here in 2023 I'm more uh that word is more flesh than it was last night and my goal say what's your what's your New Year's resolutions I don't have any I got a goal that my goal and his goal will be the same goal Hallelujah [Applause] so the spirit of lawlessness we see it everywhere it's it's permeated I mean every aspect of human life politics religion economics Science Education the the social issues every the whole fabric of human life is permeated the lid was torn from hell see the Bible that's not brother Branham using poetic license that's the Book of Revelation The Book of Revelation shows historically speaking tying prophecy to Modern events that just before the first woe which we know to be World War One that just be the event that's happening in the Book of Revelation right as that is coming before that happens an angel is cast down from heaven and given a key to the bottomless pit and a prophet ties that angel right back to Isaiah how art thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning and the and he literally has a key to open the bottomless pit and and now as brother Branham said the lid has been taken from hell and demon powers are streaming into the Earth why do you think they decided to have a global war something that had never happened how did Nations who were trying to prevent it and kings and Kaisers and and czars and and and royalty were writing letters to each other saying no no no we don't want war no we don't either no we don't either stop your armies okay I'll stop mine okay stop yours and and they couldn't stop it because demon powers had already infected the minds of men and prophecy had to become material they can say oh it's the assassination of this one I don't care what what Satan used as a catalyst it's God's word coming to pass so he's so Satan is given an increase of power in the earth that he hadn't had before he's got keys to the bottomless pit now at the end of Armageddon he's going to be thrown back into that pit and locked up and all of his powers are going to go with him and all of his influence will be gone well happy day happy day that Millennial Reign for a thousand years I won't have to worry about the devil oh my that's enough to make me run up the road screaming Hallelujah no wonder I say hasten you're coming Lord even so come quickly Lord Jesus and and then you notice you think it's an accident it's impossible to be an accident and that's that's the very same time that that in 1906 right right as Satan is released he's he's cast down and he opens the pit and demon powers are streaming and now turmoil starts in the world but at the very same time in California in 1906 God is bringing an Azusa Revival why because when when the enemy comes in like the flood God raises a standard Hallelujah to make sure his church could face the battles that it would have to face I'm here to tell you those seals were open because the battle you would have to face were unprecedented they'd never been seen no parallel for it in history Paul said it's and the Book of Emily said it's perilous times a day like never has been before you're in it the Lawless one is here but so is Christ yeah yeah Hallelujah and Satan has his material and Christ has his material and you're it and I'm it Hallelujah [Applause] these things are coming forward they're firing rapidly this is a short quick work it's a former latter rain all together runs together quickly the the Reapers from the Gentile Harvest can scarcely clear the field the field to the world they can scarcely clear the field when the Sowers for the next event are already entering the field to start sowing and the Bible says the Sowers are overtaking the Reapers because the Sowers for the next event is the spirit of Moses and Elijah to go to 144 000. but that can't happen to all these Gentile Pride members every name on the book has to be redeemed Hallelujah and we got it and and they're coming the anointing say are there so much pressure in the world there's so much brother Branham showed us that it's prophecy causing that the darkness is getting congealed and squeezed because the the approaching of the morning sun [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah and as we are being perfected it's actually causing the darkness of the world to become worse but here's the ministry of the Morning Star see and so so we find that or you know that the spirit of Moses and Elijah trying to prophecy trying to come forward and they're they're saying hey you Gentiles clear the field man going to rapture get out of here going to rapture we got to sew for the 144 000 and the bride is saying all too happy to oblige Hallelujah marching the Zion beautiful beautiful Zion Hallelujah I'm happy to be a Christian I'm happy to have a message I'm happy to have the Holy Ghost it's changing my life and it'll soon change my body unmistakably irrevocably reversibly and I'll never have to come back here and do this again so he says yep I had a pastor write to me this morning I he don't have a clue I I he said I know you're going to be preaching soon but I just got one little question on a little verse can you he had no idea he's about to erupt a volcano because I was I was all on my mind everything I'm saying now and I couldn't believe I said you got to got me ready to preach now and I'm just getting ready to come out so he I won't we're not going to take the time because I won't get to my main part I haven't got to my main part yet but we find that you asked for a comment on Genesis 4 15 now Bible readers understand that this is the threat to not kill Cain and God put a mark on him and labeled him marked him said don't anybody kill him if you kill him then there's going to be a seven times punishment see and he was saying you know what's what's your take on that I said well brother I said to me that that that scripture is the the perfect if you want a perfect antithesis if you want a perfect contrast perfect Contra distinction Genesis 4 15 contrasting with Revelation 6 6 Touch not the oil and the wine see that's God warning his family don't kill Cain because that would have made sense that would have been the logical thing to do hey this this guy is Antichrist let's kill him so before he can multiply fix the problem well it wouldn't have fixed a problem because Adam had already fallen and all nature fell under him and the problem was not not cane multiplying the problem was multiplying through sex because it wasn't the original way and so even though under holy matrimony it still comes the wrong way and so no matter what no matter how how much Adam and Eve had skins of blood no matter how much they did all children would be born in sin so but God is warning his family listen you're not going to be able to destroy him there's going to have to go seven Cycles I'll deal with him in the end don't you try to do that see now you remember brother Brandon picks that up in the church age book and he said he starts talking about how then he says you know even though the Antichrist had great power in the Dark Ages he he he was not able to completely Stamp Out the family of God you remember that he got him down to just a little sliver but he couldn't finish him and brother Branham comes back and he says and and neither could the church with all their signs and wonders and preachers and teaching and everything neither could they destroy the Antichrist almost like a like a like a like a war of attrition that's going to last for two thousand years because the principal had to remain in Matthew 13 when they said Lord there's tears among the wheat shall we destroy him says no let them grow together and at the Harvest Time I'll separate them out and I'll bind those bundles and that's plural that's plural bundles because Revelation 17 shows how that she had names of blasphemy names of blasphemy no give me Revelation 17. let's catch it while we're while we're thinking about it so I want to start at verse one all right and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials of zelage of course it's at the end time he's carrying that seventh vial talked with me because look you're about to read the context of the end so we know which Angel it was all right it's not an angel three coming to teach Angel Church age seven all right it's seven to seven and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither what what what message of all the ages after Paul did this Elijah of this day I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great that sitteth upon many Waters verse 2. it's very clear who it is with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication true and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication could I get an amen yes this is the age of lawlessness verse 3. so he carried me away in the spirit see John representing the bride it takes this messenger who has the set who also has the seventh vial to show to ID not only the one to identify Christ but he's got to identify the Antichrist because the bride needs to know and there can't be no guessing it has to be it can't be great thinkers under the man age as brilliant as they were they could get it wrong and even if they got it mostly right this had to be all correct because this would have to annihilate any charge against God's family she's going to have to receive a word that literally justifies her as though she never did it in the first place and takes her all the way back to Genesis I thank God for a messenger and a message in this day [Applause] so he carried me away in the spirit of the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full catch it full of names plural full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns now take it down pops so so it's names of blasphemy that's why when it goes into Matthew 13 it's it's it's it's bundles tears it's bundles not a bundle it's bundles and and because it's all of these Blasphemous names of man-made denominational systems who at the end time are secure Under the Umbrella of the Beast system oh friends you can't make this stuff up this is so perfect and and what what happens you see that's why you have to see that say why aren't we gone because that has to be on the earth first he's got to bind them and bundle them and that's what the confederation of church is all about and and I don't know that we certainly don't go all the way to the point where you can't buy or sell the bride's all right we already know she's gone by that time but but before the bride can leave that that has to materialize that text has to come behind flesh and there have to be denominational churches who think they have the gospel but what they have is a Blasphemous name because they have they have rejected the word in this hour they were fine for their day God used them in their day but now they're in those great leaders have died off and now they've they've become worse than the mother see so in the end time of harvest they are allowed we find them under the tribulation period allowed to still call themselves by their names see they don't they don't have to become Rome or or Catholic or nothing they can stay they can stay Lutheran and Methodist and Baptist and UPC and United Pentecost so they can stay they can stay all of those names doesn't matter they don't have to that way they don't lose the charter that's prophecy that's not a man's opinion that's prophecy you can read it in the book and the word is oblivious to it you know why because the spirit of lawlessness has blinded the eyes of them but Jesus said blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear that's that's how he could so assuredly say this bride is predestinated not to fall there's going to be a bride at the last day at the time of the former latter rain coming together a pride that will not be like Eve she will not be like every church that ever backslid she's going to go all the way to perfection so Revelation 17 then is being interpreted all the way back in Genesis 4. and Revelation and Matthew 13. no don't kill Cain that would that would because I'm going to use that in Redemption see don't don't break my plan don't kill him and then he it's what's a warning in both directions then he comes to the Antichrist don't you touch the oil and wine see because my Plan of Redemption is still working he just goes to show you friends and I think you ought to take courage today to say my goodness if I can start at Genesis 1 1 and I can go all the way to the very first word and go all the way to the last word of the Book of Revelation and I can see that God has brought every bit of it to pass so far and he's better he's batting a thousand and I'm going to bet against that no no you go ahead go ahead with all you know as I said when you don't get the real baptism of the Holy Ghost you'll hunt around till you find a version of The Gospel that you want to be true but it won't be the real one it'll be the one you wish was true and there's plenty of them out there see so now comes the kingdom being restored see so so now so now when he when he when he says here let me let me go back to our to our opening text all right so no go back to Joel chapter 2. and let's pick up at verse 24. read through it a little slower this time perfect and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm listen now God is naming all four of them so that you understand there's nothing not going to be restored so all the years that Satan destroyed the church all your life everything Satan has ever done to you you're coming back to the kingdom friends I'm here to tell you everything that you were ordained to be in the mind of God when Jesus prayed father let thy will be done in in Earth as it is let this image look like that image you have an image that God has in his mind of you and I'm here to tell you when you go soaring through the skies you're going to be back to that image and I don't care what Satan has taken and I don't even care if you were culpable and helped him Jesus Christ is giving it back this message is restoring all that was ever done to me hallelujah it's bringing me back to Pure innocence it's destroying the effects see he goes on here watch look at it watch it destroy the effects verse 26 ye shall eat in plenty see so he's destroyed the effects and be satisfied he's going to stop your crying you know we do cry but joy comes in the morning we have trouble we do sorrow but we don't sorrow as others who have no hope nothing wrong with sadness and Sorrowing sometimes God has to take you down into the valley of Sorrow to to slow you down long enough where he can talk to you it's too bad brother bam said it's too bad he said the desperation that we need a lot of times he said you you can't get desperate enough to get the faith you need because desperation is a manufacturing plant and it produces raw faith and a lot of times you can't get desperation until God brings you into a trial and then and brother Brandon just said it like this it's too bad it's too bad it has to be that way but human beings are like that see and God sometimes has to bring us down low to teach us what we need to teach when we couldn't hear it on the Mountaintop we were too busy jumping up and down and there was he said okay I'm on the Mountaintop I'm finished no you're not I'm great all I need to know you're not you got a lot you got more growing how much more until you get out of here until you get out of here well why why does why does sister Susie not have to go through my trial my goodness it looks like he likes her better than me but you know why does brother Billy why does he not have to go through what I have to go through looks like the Lord's showing favoritism Lord's not showing favoritism here's the bottom line you don't know what you'll be on the other side but he does you don't know what you need prep for but he does everybody's going to have a place and a position and Paul said in First Corinthians 15 everybody raises in their order and so you've got a mission you got a job and say it's my mission when I leave here my mission is over your mission is just starting you're to be priest and Kings you're just you're to be the Distributors of God's justice hallelujah hallelujah you're gonna set up new government in a new world called the millennium Hallelujah and there'll be Nations and peoples and there's got to be governance so you don't know what position God will have for you so you've got to be trained differently you can't get trained like me I can't get trained like you we're not going to have the same position see but his promise is can I just give you the the Bible promise you'll be satisfied and you'll praise the name of the Lord your God verse 26 and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you what God is going to do for you there you will you'll have one opinion about your life here say how is your life down there God has dealt wondrously but oh man but I saw you crying and weeping and pouting and a bad attitude and you know you quit church and you you stop paying your tithes and you criticize the song leader and the Deacon and uh but but but but I'm I'm redeemed and he cleaned me up oh what's your opinion of your life it looked pretty hard no the Lord was dealing wondrously with me oh I didn't know it but all of that was wonderful all of that hardship was wonderful see my people shall never be ashamed he shall know that I am in the midst of Israel I'll tell you something friends that has often times when we're in our darkest hour isn't that true we wonder where is God there's coming a time you'll never wonder that again you're coming to a to a reality where you will know that he's in your midst and that he is the Lord your God and none else and all those other things you worshiped were vanity and God has redeemed in my people shall never be ashamed he says again at the end of verse 27. so we find then that he's coming to restore so the effects so now here's what I want to get to so the effects of the former and latter rain falling together slash the opening of the seals slash the Mighty God unveiled slash the Revelation that has come to us and that the Revelation that you pray for every day there's nothing you should pray for more than that see it's amazing how many things we pray and ask the Lord to give us like Santa Claus and and we think of God more as a vending machine you know but really what you should be praying for is not an extra zero in your bank account or three or four model year Improvement on your vehicle or a house with an extra 10 000 square foot or a few more friends or likes that's not what you should be praying for above everything you should pray for revelation because there's nothing to give you such Prevailing Faith as revelation revelation of who he is and then you see who you are see so he's restoring all that Satan destroyed so so so and and that's that's beautiful because the the end game is and it's happening now that we get the same power signs and wonders and divine Energies that the Apostles had this thing has come full circle listen you know the it's amazing to where we talk about miracles and things that happen and we've got testimonies of even recent Miracles impossible situations where God by his Supernatural Power by simple prayer and that's all it took just a simple prayer no one had to cross the sea no one had to go up to heaven and bring it down all you had to do was pray they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and you get brother Travis and brother Matt walking into a man with no chance of life he has terminal cancer and a quarter on the side of his neck nearly as big as his own head and all they do is just tell him what the word says and they give him a testimony of another sister Faith stirs they lay hands on him pray for him just a simple thing and and now the Man's Alive and healthy and not a trace of impossible to cure cancer that's book of Acts stuff see that that's Discerning of spirits in the word of God what is it doing it's separating out the believer from the make-believer and the unbeliever see and it's beautiful and God's doing it see and so so this is this is the restoration of all that Satan destroyed you know I get to be restored back to the image that he saw of me before the foundation of the world that is the very words I pray for many of you and and and the Lord laid it even upon my heart to pray that I I it started with a particular family that I had a burden for in South Africa preaching meetings and I come out of the meetings and I'm weeping uncontrollably I can't even stop crying and I'm in my Bungalow it's in the middle of the night I don't even know what's wrong with me and I'm weeping and crying Lord God and and and I and I I get on I said oh I've got to hear some worship music I write a text hey Deb will you go to your piano sister and and sing this song and record yourself and send it to me I wanna I wanna hear that song she's like sure god father we're happy happy to do that she gets I don't know what time it was she gets out of her bed or wherever she was stop cleaning or whatever was going on and she sits down at the piano I can hear kids playing and she's she's pounding out a song she loves it and I love it and and I sit there in my room and listening to that I'm in I'm in another continent over the seven seas and I'm sitting there worshiping in spirit and in truth and you know what happens the Lord comes on my heart and I've got a particular particular need and the Lord begins to speak to me and I can hear him forming my words and he's saying this is because they asked Jesus teach us to pray and Lord said I'm going to teach you to pray pray it just like this Lord bring them the family in my mind bring them to the image today bring them a little closer to the image you saw of them before the foundation of the world and it wasn't even very long after that the Lord started expanding it saying pray this about them too and about them and about them and about them and about them so you know I don't know what's happening in your life I don't know you might be getting a spanking for all I know but it might be my fault the Lord might be pulling rugs out from under you sorry but that's what pastors do it's what Shepherds do they pray for their sheep I got a painting in my office sister Dorothy painted it's a one-off there's not another one like it in the world she painted it just for me I said sister Dorothy I see myself it's in the late night I'm standing in a field all my sheep are bedded down asleep and I see Jesus standing on a rock and I'm standing there as a shepherd and he's the great Shepherd and I'm gesturing to this and but Lord what about this one in this case and this need and he's gesturing saying okay for this one do this and for this one do this and you go into my office and look sister Dorothy painted my vision it came out of my mind and came onto a canvas and I and I and and I don't know what's happening in your lives but brother Jason finds himself often saying Lord for this family for this brother for this sister for this teenager I pray today today that you bring him a little closer don't let them go to bed until they come a little closer to the image you saw of them before the foundation of the world see he saw the life that he saw me before the foundation of the world that's why he taught us to pray thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven thy will be done as in heaven he says it in Luke backwards in heaven so in Earth see so our actions then become literally friends I don't think we realize at all times that our actions are are more often than not becoming the expression of God's mind and I think I'd like for you to go into 2023 with that on at the front of your mind because the whole Plan of Redemption at the end time was to produce a bride who would be the flesh expression of the invisible God that he would be seen by the world in you so you want to you want to prayer for for tonight say Lord thank you for this wonderful day give me a good night's resting in the morning when I Rise give me a little more Jesus so that I can go forward and I can be a greater expression of you friends don't pray for anything till you get all of that that's becoming my all-consuming prayer Lord more and more and more and more less of me more of you less of me more of you till there's none of me and it's all of you that's that's really the true interaction between Heaven and Earth that's what it's all about that's the interaction between Heaven and Earth you have a dimensional portal that's what prayer is it literally I'm here to tell you something I went through a dimensional portal here a couple weeks ago brother Matthew sat in an office and told us last night that a dimensional portal opened up and a being stepped into his office Hallelujah and I I went back and I was looking at his text he was trying to explain it to me said dad is so incredible he said I was scared but there were but it wasn't fear he said I was scared but it wasn't anxiety how do you be scared with no fear and anxiety that takes a supernatural presence oh my this is why Paul would say First Corinthians 10 11 Noah First Corinthians 10 11. now all these things happened unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come so so without the mind of Christ restored back you know I mean the the whole purpose is to see these great secrets in the back part of God's mind if we don't have that then we're no better offer further along than the Bible students of History and that that's what they had I mean there has to come something to finish this thing it can't just keep going to another age there aren't any more ages and so there has to be something more than just history students uh taking our taking giving our opinion with the rest of the theological World our opinion with 33 000 other denominational opinions that was never going to bring Heaven and Earth together it would take the voice of God speaking to us in this day Hallelujah see so that it's so that even if history can be known and much of it is and the world is still crashing and burning modern Christianity leading the way see because the way can't be known intellectually see with all of their brilliant scholarship the world is steadily getting worse and always has been and has never turned around and from the time that Lucifer was cast out of heaven and giving keys to the bottomless pit that was gonna that was going to bring on the the first woe which was going to lead to the second which was going to lead to the third which was going to a white man sweet man from the face of the Earth but there's an injunction here you got to hold up I got servants I got a seal there's a dreadful day of the Lord coming in Malachi but hold on I got a first send Elijah get my pride out of the way otherwise friends if it's not that then we're no we're in no better position than all the rest of them oh but God rich in mercy God did something more than just give us intellectualism he opened those Seven Seals you see the confusion and there was confusion in the early days I remembered I grew up through it sitting in ministers meetings and hearing them talking is the seven seal open is it not is it is it not yes it is no it's not well it's not to the public but it is to the bride what does that even mean and and you know they but now at that but now that we come these decades later I can tell you Ministry around the world understand that of course it's open the confusion as to whether or not the seventh seal was indeed open was due in part to the infant age of the Bride when she was born remember she was an infant remember when Jesus was coming three stars lined up the Wise Men followed them remember that and and brother Branham shows now as as the seals are getting ready to come as the mighty Angels getting ready to descend a seventh angel standing on the earth waiting see he's already a messenger to Leo to see it to a church age but he's not in the ministry of Malachi for you that doesn't come to the opening of the seals now he crosses under a new anointing and because the age put Christ out and rejected him and now that Prophet is not trying to get people into that church he's trying to get him out of it come out of her that's the message of the Hour come out of her my people why should I come out of this church because you're you're being a partaker of her sin and you're going to be destroyed with her see so come out come up come out where come up higher come up into the opening of the word but she was an infant when she was born brother Branham says that on tape he says five stars lined up right before the seals open he said what was it it was a it was an announcement it was announcing uh an infant bride it was it was he says it was announcing her approach she was about to be birthed like genesis by the word um see so part of the reason for the confusion was in part at least to the infant age of the word born bride she wasn't realizing that although open that although it was open now follow me closely because this is really heavy on my heart I want you to understand this concept she wasn't realizing at her young tender age that although it was certainly open its Fuller understanding would come with her future growth going forward by that I mean that when we begin to see that it was open we realize now what the prophet has said not only during the seals Seven Seals series but even more at what he said after the Seven Seals opened see that's why when you come to what is the attraction on the mountain brother Adam's a shocked and stunned and he's he's saying my goodness what happened back there in Coronado Forest 30 miles north of Tucson it's just Dawning on him even as a prophet wow I see it now it was a setting of Prophecy a setting of History and he's trying to get this young little bride to understand when we begin to see that it was open and we realize what a prophet said about it during the seals and after the seals regarding the coming of the Lord I mean the sermons preached after the seals made us realize that the mystery hidden under the seventh seal was to be understood as the word coming into the bride and I've thought a lot about how I worded that I want to say it again the sermons preached after the seals particularly made us realize as we began to grow and mature and decade fell upon decade we've begun to realize that the mystery hidden under the seventh seal was to be understood as the word forming itself and a bride you understand me that's why that's why it's still a mystery to the world and it wouldn't matter if they heard the whole seven seal series and it wouldn't matter if they heard all the Menace the sermons after the Seven Seals it still takes a revelation it still requires the Holy Spirit to break it upon us the greatest revelation we can have and the one brother Branham taught us to pray for above all other Revelation was the rebel was a revelation of who we are in Christ this is why we spend so much time getting the devil off your back about your past failures let me say today is an authoritative voice he has no charge against you that God will hear this bride stands flawless she's a flawless diamond and he will not hear a charge against her this is what the opening of the seals has done that's the super weapon of mass destruction that the devil doesn't want you to know see that's the one we wield against the devil now brother Branham says by God's spirit to discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our eye in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we Prevail over them I've thought about Prevail over them yeah all those demons trying to hold those Gates I just kick them down and crush them and I just walk right over the top of them walk right into my Promised Land he's not keeping me out of out of Zion Hallelujah because Zion is my promise I'm gonna restore Zion I'm gonna restore all the years that the canker worm in my arm and everything Satan did I'm going to take it all back and I'm going to finish you and as I finish you you're going to finish him see so the mystery you remember the the mystery that Paul spoke of uh Ephesians 3 Noah Ephesians 3 now watch here's the mystery verse 8. through 13. unto me who are less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery so now the mystery is not a Doctrine the mystery wants Fellowship so the mystery's a person it's not a teaching it's not books and tapes and quotes you understand it's a person Hallelujah see and here's why so Paul's desire is to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden God see this is the baptism of the Holy Ghost who created All Things by Jesus Christ remember he said I'll pull you out of the mire and I'll sprinkle clean water on you I'll justify you of all your past sins now justification is great for your past sins I don't help you in the future see the the foolish virgin get that they get Justified of all their past sins they repent and God forgives all their sins and they even get the second stage of of the Holy Ghost in sanctification on their flesh and they live Sanctified lives because Matthew 25 shows that they're righteous people they're Saints which means sanctified so the foolish version is not the Tommy right of Christianity you see represented today foolish virgin are sanctified people period in the story they're Sanctified they're righteous living see and so so but but he but he said I won't stop there I'll I'll bring you out and I'll sprinkle clean water on you I'll clean you up and then I'll give you a new spirit see there's sanctification he says but then I'll give you my spirit now there's the token and when I pour my spirit in you I will cause you to keep my word he's not saying you won't ever make a mistake he's saying you'll never disbelieve again you'll accept and say Amen to every word and even if I can't produce it I want to and even if I'm failing I say God forgive me help me help me to be all that the word has said about me to the intent verse 10 to the intent that now under the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord and whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him wherefore I desire that you faint not in my tribulation my tribulations for you which is your glory see so so the body then so the opening of The Seven Seals would show that the body of Christ is literally seen as a pyramid now Peter Built that thing see said it starts out with a foundation of faith that's your that's your new birth you're not it's not it's not it's not perfect Faith until you're born again see and then you're adding on top of that adding on top of that you're not you're not waiting to get good enough to get the crown you're already Good Enough by predestination you've surrendered your life and repented of your sins and your past from Death unto life and now God is building on top of you this and this and this and this and this now quite naturally he's not gonna expend a lot of power through you if you're not willing to add and add and add and add an ad he's not he's not an unwise father who just spoils his children hands out Supernatural power like candy you're going to have to add to Faith virtue you're gonna have to add to Virtual you're gonna have to add you're gonna have to add in some brotherly kindness you're gonna have to add in some Temperance you're going to have to work on that see so the body is seen as a pyramid of the history of the true church it's divided into seven Church ages with their Messengers to each age and their accompanying message so the res the restoration restored Paul's vision of the mystery that's what this restoration has accomplished it has restored Paul's vision of the mystery it literally took a church in Decline the first thing it had was falling through the first through the second through the third my goodness by the time they got to the fourth they'd crowned a false prophet I mean this is bad see I mean it's where Satan's seed is goodness gracious see and so so God's got a first stop ah the decline arrested turn it around okay Luther you ready yes sir Lord all right launch and we start building it back John Wesley get ready get ready I'm ready sir six star slings it into the earth now the church takes another step get ready you Azusa revivalist because I'm going to pour out the promise of Joel and I'm going to bring restore gifts and and power back to the church you know why you know why brother I said God did that because the church didn't it although it was a true church it didn't seem to have the power at ought to have and so God turns loose gifts and signs and wonders and restores that back to the church why anybody would want to shut that down is a mystery to me I mean if you're going to shut the gifts down shut the fruits of the spirit down I want all of all of it I want all the fruits and all the gifts and I want all the operation I want all the complete Liberty of the Holy Ghost we have to be afraid of that we're a mature bride we're not an infant bride anymore chasing after Pentecostalism we got the real Pentecost the true foundation of the church hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's what we're enjoying today friends that's what the sales restore to us I'll not give away my inheritance it's your inheritance it belongs to you [Applause] that's why a prophet had to see a bride brought in review twice he sees the alpha Church he's rejoicing and then here comes the here comes the Church of of of the ages and it's not really the bride it's the church and it gets worse and worse and worse until he gets to the last one he can't even look at it it's so vulgar it's such it's such vulgarity and nastiness and and partial partial you know indecency and and worldly music and they've turned Church worship into a rock and roll affair and it doesn't even matter they can stand up there when women with their bobbed off hair contrary to the scripture and cry real tears thinking they're worshiping God and they're worshiping Lucifer because the Bible teaches that they have forsaken the word of God oh come out of her my people Barry be free today I'm giving you a word of Liberty rejoice in the in the Liberty that God has given us men can get up there and smoke and drink and curse and Corrals married three and four or five times and get up there and be pastors and preachers and teachers vomit that's vomit that's a Bible word not my word their tables are filled with vomit that's not the power of God this is the power of God when this becomes living flesh that's God living in his church Hallelujah see so the bride he couldn't look at it but finally a bride has to be brought back again and he said I heard somebody was marching and he said I looked and here come that sainted bunch of little girls all clean smooth long hair flowing down their back brother says no paint no makeup none of the world's nonsense they didn't they didn't look like they went into a five and dime with a magnet on and covered up in every kind of nonsense Hallelujah this this bride was clean and she was smooth and she was Marching In the harmony of the word marching to the step of the gospel and what was it it was an old-timey song Onward Christian Soldiers hallelujah how many Christian Soldiers we got here today that are willing to march on to Zion oh my she was marching to the rhythm of the word that's sheet music that Jesus Christ composed himself oh go listen to Shalom go listen to the Masterpiece it was a symphony this bride was to play out the music that he wrote this is this is music see he wrote this oh friends do you understand do you understand that this isn't a report card this is a marriage book I'm not graded by some report card I'm in love with the King oh I'm in love with the word it's changed my whole life it's changed my whole appetite it's taken the things of the world away from me I don't desire those things anymore and the word is now becoming behind skin oh my oh my oh my the kingdom is being restored do you believe that today they want to run up and down the road and say there's a non-negotiable oh yeah what is it you have to believe the trinity really so you understand Paul didn't believe what you believe about that neither did Peter neither did John so does that mean they're out they didn't believe what the Trinity teaches today not at all not even a little bit not even third cousin twice removed laughs and believe it at all you know Paul Paul knew exactly who he was it's the word of God it's Christ it's Christ seeking to live in you that's the godhead it's Christ expressing himself from Genesis in a family and letting it go through the whole Plan of Redemption and restoring it back and that bride is literally living the sheet music of the word oh there's there's non-negotiables you better believe there's some non-negotiables first non-negotiable is you must be born again oh do your better good to join a church put your name on a book wouldn't do you any good to join this church you actually can't join it we don't have a membership but it wouldn't do you any good to just sit here and be a carnal believer you'll still miss the rapture you'll still show up show up one day on Sunday hopefully you will and you'll be sitting here by yourself I don't want that I don't want that for not wanting you I want us all I want all yous guys that's my Pennsylvania friend used to say I want all yous to make it you must be born again see and and and and and another one you know it there you know there there's two I would say two non-negotiables you know the the the the the world tries to make the Trinity a non-negotiable there are two non-negotiable elements to redemption in the last days and neither one of them are a construct of human intellectualism you have to be born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the only way that comes is when God Reveals His word and you agree and say Amen to every word that he has revealed every word that he reveals you have to say me Lord me right here Me Count Me In I'll take it that's me I'll believe it I'll not only blow not only hear it I'll receive it I'll act upon it amen hallelujah all act upon it see and and and and and then in the last day we had to have the perfect word it had to be restored back because it was Paul's perfect teaching that was taking them to a body change only they backslid and so it began to decline so if he's going to get it if he's going to get a bride raptured he can't come with some partial truth in the ages he's got to he's got to have a vessel that can go all the way back and pick up Paul's original teaching buy-ins by prophetic inspiration and bring the full message back to a full bride who can have full faith and get a full body change so another non-negotiable it had to be a prophet that is non-negotiable it had to come to a profit because you had to be born again by the Holy Ghost and Prophets are they rightly divide the word of Truth amen Maya I could just keep going I could keep going I could keep going we'll catch it for another time I'm already into overtime stand up
