[0:29] [Music]
[6:19] morning everyone God bless you let's
[6:21] stand and
[6:25] pray gracious Heavenly Father we just
[6:28] come before you Lord and we're so thank
[6:29] thankful for your mercy and Grace Lord
[6:31] we ask that your presence be with us
[6:33] this morning Lord that you would come
[6:34] upon your word Lord and and take it and
[6:37] make it alive and real in our hearts
[6:39] father just uh ask that you'd help us to
[6:42] step out of the way Lord uh put the the
[6:45] cares of this world and the cares of
[6:47] this life to the side that we would
[6:50] focus on you Lord we commit our time to
[6:52] You For Your Glory we ask in jesus' name
[6:55] amen all right brother Mark if you want
[6:57] to bring up the PowerPoint
[7:00] we'll just uh as you're standing um
[7:04] we'll go ahead and and read the
[7:08] scripture in uh 2 Corinthians chapter
[7:12] 5 and we'll read verses 1-
[7:17] 4 for we know that if our Earthly House
[7:20] of this Tabernacle were dissolved we
[7:22] have a building of God a house not made
[7:25] with hands Eternal in the heavens for in
[7:29] this we groan earnestly Desiring to be
[7:32] clothed upon with our house which is
[7:34] from Heaven if so be that being clothed
[7:37] we shall not be found naked for we that
[7:39] are in this Tabernacle do groan being
[7:42] burdened not for that we would be
[7:43] unclothed but clothed upon that
[7:46] mortality might be swallowed up of life
[7:50] amen may the Lord add the blessing to
[7:51] the reading of his word you can be
[7:55] seated we're looking this is part two
[7:57] we're looking at our future home
[8:00] revealed we often say things like we
[8:04] lost our mom or we lost our brother or
[8:07] we lost our uh whatever it might be
[8:10] relative and um I think we should stop
[8:14] talking this way because that's not the
[8:17] reality and we're going to be on I think
[8:19] screen number 22 is where we started
[8:22] brother Mark um we didn't
[8:25] lose those those those who are
[8:28] Christians we didn't lose them we know
[8:30] exactly where they are and uh we're
[8:33] we're not we can't see them we can't be
[8:37] where they're at but we know exactly
[8:39] where they are it's it's not a loss um
[8:44] to us now it feels that way but Through
[8:47] The Eyes of faith we didn't lose
[8:50] anything I didn't lose my mom a few
[8:52] months ago I know exactly where she is
[8:56] she's a she's a
[8:57] Christian she she she's still a
[9:00] Christian and she's in in the presence
[9:02] of the Lord and she's at she's she's
[9:06] taking a rest and so I I I of course I'm
[9:11] I'm sad every day everyone can probably
[9:14] relate that's lost somebody that's close
[9:16] a parent or a grandparent I I I miss my
[9:19] mother every day I almost the day
[9:22] doesn't go by I think oh I should talk
[9:23] to her about this or I should talk to
[9:25] her about that and well I can't now but
[9:28] I will
[9:29] there'll be one day we'll be we'll be
[9:33] reunited so it's it's not as though we
[9:36] lost
[9:37] them and I think we should stop speaking
[9:40] those words from our mouth and erase
[9:42] that from our vocabulary they've gone on
[9:45] ahead we're going to we're going to meet
[9:46] them we'll catch up with them
[9:49] soon as we read in that scripture I'm
[9:52] going to just uh try to get forward
[9:54] there I lost
[9:57] it my PowerPoint don't like me this is
[9:59] the second time this has happened but as
[10:02] we looked at that scripture 2
[10:03] Corinthians 5 if you want to turn if you
[10:05] have your Bible turn turn there with me
[10:09] speaks of the Earthly House of this
[10:11] Tabernacle it's not it's not speaking of
[10:13] our home address the Earthly Tabernacle
[10:16] that it's speaking of is this body this
[10:20] house if it's
[10:22] dissolved we're told that we have a
[10:24] building of God or if you look at this
[10:27] verse a building from God in other words
[10:30] God is building something that's what
[10:32] the that's what the scripture is
[10:34] speaking of not as though it's an intact
[10:37] fully developed building but as we learn
[10:39] from brother brandham in things that are
[10:41] to be as we hear the word as we're
[10:45] convicted in our hearts over the word
[10:48] God is adding word on top of word
[10:50] building that theophany for us and so
[10:54] God is building that's it's it's
[10:56] speaking of a process of building we
[10:58] have that building buing and God is
[11:00] building in the process of building it
[11:01] but then the next very next thing tells
[11:04] us something connected to building that
[11:06] seems so strange it says it's Eternal in
[11:08] the heavens so how can you be Eternal
[11:12] and also be a building because God's
[11:15] word says so he's building us he's he's
[11:19] transforming us and as he's transforming
[11:21] up the our character here a body a
[11:25] theophany is being built there that body
[11:28] that's being built there is actually
[11:30] based off of what God had in his mind
[11:34] for all of eternity that body has always
[11:36] existed no not as a dis separate being
[11:40] but was a part of God's own life and so
[11:43] when this one is dissolved we have an
[11:45] already waiting is how brother brandham
[11:48] spoke of it it's already waiting for
[11:50] us in this one we grown and I think this
[11:54] is the this is the the heart and the
[11:57] vision of a Christian this is what Paul
[12:01] viewed things like is I'm groaning in
[12:04] this body earnestly Desiring to be
[12:07] clothed upon with that house which is
[12:10] eternal in the heavens earnestly
[12:13] Desiring to go into his theophany see
[12:16] we're doing everything we can to run
[12:19] away and be fearful of death we got to
[12:21] that's got to change in our hearts death
[12:24] is not our enemy
[12:26] anymore since what Jesus Christ did for
[12:29] us on Calvary and God raised him from
[12:31] the dead death has no sting or it
[12:34] shouldn't anymore to to the heart and
[12:36] mind of a
[12:37] Christian death has no Victory the grave
[12:40] has no victory over us anymore it in
[12:43] itself is part of our Victory it's just
[12:47] another path of our
[12:50] journey I love this Exchange in The Lord
[12:54] of the Rings between Pippen and Gandalf
[12:57] Pippen says they're in a place where
[12:59] they are totally destroyed and
[13:02] everything is seems like it's lost and
[13:05] they're all going to die they're being
[13:06] surrounded by the enemy and Pippen says
[13:08] I didn't think it was going to end this
[13:10] way Gandalf looks at him and says end no
[13:14] the journey doesn't end here death is
[13:16] just another path one that we all must
[13:18] take the gray rain curtain of this world
[13:21] rolls back and all change to Silver
[13:24] glass and then you see it Pippen says
[13:28] what Gandalf see
[13:29] what white Shores and Beyond the far
[13:32] Green Country under a swift
[13:34] Sunrise Pippen says well that isn't so
[13:37] bad Gandalf responds no no it isn't see
[13:42] death is merely another part of our Jour
[13:44] a continuation of our journey we we we
[13:49] we fear it we do everything we can to
[13:51] avoid it well let's put it this way I
[13:53] want to be here as long as God wants me
[13:56] to be here when it's time for me to go I
[13:59] want to go not fearful not upset I want
[14:02] to go with my hands raised and saying
[14:04] thank you Jesus enough of this pest
[14:07] house I want to go to my father's
[14:10] house it's just another part of our
[14:13] journey it's a continuation it's not the
[14:16] end of the journey it's not a finishing
[14:19] thing it is a continuation it's a it's
[14:22] part of the fruition of this journey
[14:25] until we get to that new body ultimately
[14:29] that's that's our final destination is
[14:32] that new body on a new Earth on a
[14:35] renewed Earth a redeemed Earth in
[14:38] Philippians
[14:39] 1:23 Paul writes for I am a in a
[14:42] straight betwix two having a desire to
[14:45] depart and to be with Christ Which is
[14:48] far better
[14:51] amen think about that for a second what
[14:54] is your desire what is your heart as a
[14:57] believer is do you have a desire to
[15:04] depart and to be with Christ and do you
[15:06] view that as far better than staying
[15:09] here amen unfortunately many of us uh me
[15:12] included very few times think and feel
[15:15] that way that's my doctrine that I hold
[15:17] for
[15:18] myself and I I'm I'm asking the Lord to
[15:21] renew my heart into what I believe is
[15:24] true and what I know is
[15:27] true so that body that's prepared for us
[15:31] is not another
[15:33] person it's not a new start it's not a
[15:37] new beginning it's actually simply us us
[15:42] continuing in a different form and a
[15:44] different shape same REM same remor same
[15:47] person same calling same desires same
[15:49] likes only now we're not in a body that
[15:54] is pushing us towards sin and evil that
[15:57] flesh body is is gone as brother
[15:59] brandham calls it a pest house we're
[16:01] living this body is a pest house as much
[16:04] as we try to take care of it and be good
[16:06] stewards of it yet at the same time we
[16:08] know it's simply a pest house and this
[16:11] one it's going to have to either be
[16:13] changed or
[16:15] rot and we go we go into that
[16:19] theophany it's this we're the very same
[16:21] person we look the same we have the same
[16:23] name we have the same likes and dislikes
[16:27] only all things will be purified based
[16:30] on the character that's in the heart see
[16:33] the flesh battles against that true
[16:35] character that's in the soul constantly
[16:38] when we go to that theophany when we go
[16:40] to our new body the The Immortal body
[16:44] those those fleshly fleshly sinful
[16:48] desires are completely gone today we
[16:50] have to Die
[16:52] daily that's because of this the flesh
[16:54] the nature of our of our soul there's
[16:57] still a sinful nature there within us in
[17:01] the future home brother brandom says
[17:03] death doesn't change you death only
[17:05] changes your Dwelling Place amen I want
[17:09] to change my Dwelling Place I'm tired of
[17:12] this old world Amen I'm tired of this
[17:16] battle with sin I want to be set free
[17:18] from this body of Flesh that's
[17:21] continually pushing me towards sin
[17:23] there's something inside saying this is
[17:25] not right I can't do this can't be this
[17:27] can't be the way a person must live this
[17:30] can't be the battle that we constantly
[17:32] have to face thank God we have the
[17:34] victory through our Lord Jesus
[17:38] Christ Luke
[17:40] 16 now we're looking at and and I I
[17:45] guess I have a chart on the PowerPoint
[17:47] to show you but probably have to be next
[17:50] time when you look at when we talk about
[17:52] our future
[17:54] home uh I think you have to understand
[17:56] stand it this way when God created this
[17:59] Earth Heaven and Earth were
[18:01] one okay this was this was the place
[18:05] where God was going to be with men right
[18:09] sin came in and it brought a separation
[18:11] now Heaven and Earth are separated Earth
[18:13] is merely a
[18:15] shadow of
[18:17] Heaven Earth is a shadow of the things
[18:21] that are Eternal and there's a
[18:23] separation now between that you see
[18:25] brother bam says you see a tree dying it
[18:27] means there's a tree
[18:29] that's not struggling for life you see a
[18:31] man dying it means there's a body a man
[18:33] not struggling for Life see so if you're
[18:35] talking about trees and Men we can take
[18:38] that further into everything here
[18:40] because we know even the Tabernacle the
[18:43] temple was merely a copy of what Moses
[18:46] saw in heaven and so we we can go you
[18:50] can go further and further and expand
[18:52] that understanding to realize that this
[18:55] is merely a shadow of reality you see a
[18:59] mountain that's crumbling it's uh
[19:02] earthquakes and so forth there's a
[19:04] mountain that's not doing
[19:08] that we can go on and on you see a
[19:10] polluted lake you see a polluted ocean
[19:13] there's an ocean that's not polluted
[19:14] there's we can go on and on and you
[19:17] understand what I'm trying to the point
[19:18] I'm trying to make is that we think of
[19:20] Heaven as a stale place it's it's just
[19:22] this white place and there's like a fog
[19:24] across the floor and there's a fog on
[19:27] the ceiling and you're just sort of in
[19:28] this like unreal place it's not that
[19:31] that's a lie from Satan to make you
[19:34] think it's boring the same thing as goes
[19:36] speaks about hell you think oh well H
[19:39] people in the world hell is a party so
[19:41] that's where I want to go no hell's no
[19:43] party you're
[19:44] alone you're it's the you're you're so
[19:47] alone that you and you'll it'll never be
[19:50] resolved and it'll never be fixed until
[19:52] you're out of existence and it's a
[19:55] burning place of Torment there's no
[19:57] parties going going on I don't think
[20:00] there's any communication going on
[20:02] unless it's between the devil and and
[20:04] his
[20:06] minions see we have to understand that
[20:09] so when the fall took place God created
[20:13] a temporary holding place for man and
[20:19] two sections of it one was hell one is
[20:24] Paradise at one point in time this was
[20:27] in the heart of the Earth we read about
[20:29] that and that there's a great Gulf fixed
[20:31] and no one can pass in
[20:33] between in Luke 16 it speaks of this and
[20:36] we're going to read that so then that's
[20:38] only temporary because God's permanent
[20:41] purpose is Heaven and Earth are one here
[20:43] and there's no hell no such thing as
[20:46] hell God never created hell for to be a
[20:49] permanent thing he created for the devil
[20:51] and his
[20:56] angels so then we have that and I
[20:59] believe hell is temporary and I believe
[21:01] the current Heaven is temporary only in
[21:04] the sense of its
[21:06] separation from Earth see that heaven
[21:10] it's it's Eternal the separation is
[21:13] temporary see heaven will be and Earth
[21:16] will be United together again at the end
[21:19] of the
[21:21] Millennium you don't you won't have any
[21:23] separation you won't in at the in in the
[21:26] Eternal time in the New Jerusalem it
[21:29] says the Tabernacle of God is with men
[21:32] see not the Tabernacle of men is with
[21:35] God but God is dwelling on Earth again
[21:39] with men and women his sons and
[21:41] daughters that he created amen so then
[21:44] we have the intermediate we read about
[21:45] this in Luke
[21:47] 16 uh
[21:49] 22 and it came to pass that the beggar
[21:51] died and was carried by the Angels into
[21:53] Abraham's bosom the rich man also died
[21:56] and was buried and in hell he lift up
[21:59] his eyes being in torments and seeth
[22:01] Abraham a far off and Lazarus in his
[22:04] bosom and he cried and said Father
[22:05] Abraham have mercy on me and send
[22:08] Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his
[22:10] finger in water and cool my tongue for
[22:13] I'm tormented in this flame but Abraham
[22:14] said Son remember that thou in thy
[22:17] lifetime receiveth thy good things and
[22:18] likewise Lazarus evil things but now he
[22:21] has comforted Thou Art tormented and
[22:23] beside all this between us and you there
[22:25] is a great Gulf fixed so that they which
[22:27] would pass
[22:28] from hence to you cannot neither can
[22:30] they pass to us that would come from
[22:32] then then he said I pray thee therefore
[22:34] father that thou would Ascend him to my
[22:37] father's house for I have five Brethren
[22:39] that he may testify unto them lest they
[22:41] also come into this place of Torment
[22:43] Abraham saith unto him they have Moses
[22:45] and the prophets let them hear them and
[22:47] he said nay Father Abraham but if one
[22:49] went unto them from the dead they will
[22:51] repent and he said unto them if they
[22:52] hear not Moses and the prophets neither
[22:54] will they be persuaded though one rose
[22:58] from the dead so here we see upon the de
[23:01] upon death Lazarus is carried to
[23:05] Paradise By Angels amen I want to be
[23:08] carried by angels to Paradise amen the
[23:13] rich man was in torment he was
[23:16] thirsty he cried across the gulf to
[23:18] Abraham and Lazarus how that works and
[23:21] how that we don't know but somehow
[23:24] that's that that was either allowed
[23:26] temporarily or that could could happen
[23:28] under the old Covenant it can't happen
[23:30] anymore because Paradise in the heart of
[23:32] the earth is emptied out it's a
[23:34] different location we don't know
[23:37] exactly they keep their distinct
[23:40] identities that they had while on Earth
[23:44] Lazarus was still Lazarus and referred
[23:46] to as the beggar the rich man was
[23:48] referred to the rich man even though
[23:51] their positions were reversed Lazarus
[23:53] was now the rich man he was but he was
[23:55] still the beggar the rich man was no
[23:57] longer the rich man he was the beggar
[23:59] see they flipped
[24:01] positions and yet they're still known by
[24:04] what their experience was on Earth and
[24:07] who they were on
[24:09] Earth he asked for mercy so here
[24:12] somebody in hell is praying many there's
[24:14] many of people they never prayed their
[24:15] whole life and now they're in Hell
[24:17] praying every day deliver me deliver my
[24:20] family get me out of
[24:23] here they still had a feeling for their
[24:26] family so if someone in hell has a
[24:27] Feeling for his family what about the
[24:28] people in heaven amen still have a
[24:31] feeling for their family still have a
[24:33] feeling for what's happening on Earth
[24:35] Revelation
[24:38] 6 9- 11 and when he had opened the fifth
[24:42] seal i s saw under the altar Souls of
[24:45] them that were slain for the word of God
[24:47] and for the testimony which they held
[24:49] and they cried with a loud voice saying
[24:51] how long oh Lord holy and true Dost thou
[24:53] not judge and avenge our blood on them
[24:55] that dwell on the Earth and white robes
[24:58] were given unto every one of them and it
[25:00] was said unto them that they should rest
[25:02] yet for a little season until their
[25:04] fellow servants also and their Brethren
[25:06] that they should be killed as they were
[25:08] should be
[25:11] fulfilled so we look at this and we
[25:14] see here that the people under the fifth
[25:17] seal we understand these are Jews that
[25:19] were uh persecuted and martyred and they
[25:23] were under the Altar and brother bham
[25:25] shows us that this is Jews because if it
[25:28] was Christians they would say father
[25:30] forgive them for they know not what they
[25:31] do these ones are crying for vengeance
[25:33] so these are people in a theophany okay
[25:37] let's understand it let's get the big
[25:39] picture they're in a
[25:41] theophany and they're there as Jewish
[25:43] people in a place called under the altar
[25:48] all right and they pray they ask God a
[25:54] request that's prayer so they say h so
[25:59] number one is in heaven and even in the
[26:02] Eternal age there's still
[26:08] time okay so that doesn't mean that time
[26:10] ends it means there's still the process
[26:13] of time because when God made in the
[26:14] beginning he
[26:16] made the sun he made the moon he made
[26:19] stars and he said it before the fall
[26:21] said it was for times and for seasons
[26:23] and for signs
[26:25] okay and so here they are
[26:28] in a
[26:29] theophany in a body that'll never die
[26:32] and they're looking at what's happening
[26:33] on Earth and they say
[26:36] boy the Judgment of these people hasn't
[26:38] come yet they're still persecuting us
[26:41] they're still trying to kill our people
[26:43] and God hasn't brought vengeance upon
[26:45] those people yet so they see that and
[26:47] they say God when will you bring
[26:50] Vengeance on them see so they're looking
[26:52] at it in the terms of time now
[26:55] perspective changes completely when when
[26:57] you're in a body that will never die
[26:59] even though you're still affected by and
[27:01] seeing time and still these people F
[27:04] these people's Focus though they are in
[27:07] under the altar in heaven their focus is
[27:10] what God is doing on the earth still
[27:13] that's the place where God is revealed
[27:15] that's the place where God is working
[27:17] and moving and that's the primary place
[27:20] where the focus of Heaven is all
[27:24] right so they're seeing and saying we're
[27:27] looking at the Plan of Redemption and
[27:29] we're seeing that this part hasn't been
[27:31] fulfilled when will you do that look at
[27:33] God's answer rest a little
[27:35] while so even there he answers them with
[27:39] a answer that contains time rest for a
[27:42] little
[27:43] season until what until the other Jews
[27:48] are killed and and martyred for their
[27:51] faith amen we see this H we saw this
[27:53] happen again now Jews killed because
[27:56] they're Jews they
[27:58] 00
[28:00] horrible but they still have to rest all
[28:02] of them now they're resting together
[28:05] that those that are believers those that
[28:07] really had a testimony and holding to
[28:09] the word of God I I I believe God Honors
[28:13] that because he blinded
[28:18] them we see also the story of uh Samuel
[28:23] and Saul Saul is going goes to the lady
[28:28] that's that's a witch the Witch of
[28:30] Endor Saul can't get an answer from God
[28:33] about what to do so he goes to a witch
[28:36] and uh there she calls up the dead and
[28:41] you know you can go this this is always
[28:43] creates questions with people but I
[28:45] think as message Believers we have what
[28:47] brother brandham taught us about this we
[28:49] understand that that this that Samuel
[28:54] came up and Samuel prophesied
[28:58] see whether this was an exception to the
[29:02] rule or what I think usually a witch is
[29:04] not dealing with dead humans I think the
[29:07] witch is usually dealing with demon
[29:11] spirits but under this circumstance God
[29:13] was going to turn things around and
[29:15] she's terrified because a prophet of God
[29:18] robed in white comes up and begins to
[29:23] prophesy and so we we see
[29:26] that Samuel is still a
[29:29] prophet though he's in Paradise he's
[29:32] still a
[29:33] prophet Revelation
[29:36] 19 uh verses 1-4 we
[29:39] see the Saints in heaven rejoicing over
[29:43] over the
[29:44] Judgment of Babylon and the great
[29:47] the great on
[29:50] Earth that's their focus seeing what's
[29:53] happened
[29:54] there
[29:56] Elijah and Moses come and meet with
[30:00] Jesus on Mount TR Transfiguration
[30:02] they're still prophets they're aware of
[30:03] the prophetic timetables they're coming
[30:06] and they're speaking with Jesus and
[30:08] saying your departure will be
[30:09] accomplished shortly and there and Jesus
[30:12] is discussing this with them they're
[30:15] still
[30:17] prophets Hebrews
[30:23] 12:1 wherefore seeing we also are
[30:26] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[30:28] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[30:31] and the sin would just so easily beset
[30:33] us and let us run with patience the race
[30:36] that is set before us so it's showing us
[30:39] that the saints that have gone before us
[30:41] are a cloud of
[30:44] witnesses this very this is fascinating
[30:47] to me because the picture that's being
[30:49] painted is the the the Roman or the
[30:52] Greek
[30:53] games it's speaking of how they would
[30:57] run that race in the uh my brain is not
[31:00] putting together but the not the
[31:03] Coliseum but the other place that they
[31:05] had um where they had the races hip uh
[31:08] the Hippodrome and things like that so
[31:12] they the Witnesses are like the
[31:16] spectators the fans in the stands think
[31:18] about a football game we'll we'll think
[31:21] about it in some in terms that we
[31:23] understand you know run this race so
[31:26] there's a there's a race and there's
[31:28] Spectators that are cheering you on so
[31:31] Paul is using this picture there's
[31:32] people watching you there's Saints in
[31:35] heaven watching what you're doing as a
[31:38] cloud of as as a as a a a a group of
[31:42] fans cheering you on and he's using that
[31:45] as a statement to encourage you to
[31:48] obedience to encourage you to put to
[31:50] death the flesh to encourage you to lay
[31:53] aside sin sinful things that have been
[31:55] hanging on to you so that you can run
[31:59] the race with patience that's set before
[32:02] you amen so you're not when someone when
[32:06] your family goes to to to heaven we
[32:09] think they're cut off from us we don't
[32:11] know anything about them they don't know
[32:13] anything about us the first part is
[32:15] right we don't know only by the word do
[32:18] we know about them right and that's more
[32:21] sure than
[32:22] anything but that we we we we're not to
[32:25] communicate with them we don't pray to
[32:28] them right the scripture forbids that we
[32:31] only pray to the father in the name of
[32:33] Jesus
[32:34] Christ however the other part that
[32:38] usually is put forward is they don't
[32:40] know anything about that's going on
[32:42] Earth otherwise it would cease to be
[32:43] heaven but we see that's not so from
[32:45] scripture scripture doesn't declare that
[32:47] to us that they don't know anything
[32:48] about that's going here what happens is
[32:51] the perspective is toally different when
[32:54] you're in a body that can't be killed
[32:55] you're going to think about things quite
[32:57] differently when you're in a body that
[32:59] doesn't have a sinful nature you will
[33:01] think about things quite differently so
[33:03] seeing what happens on Earth as a as a
[33:06] Christian without any sin on you you're
[33:08] not going to say oh man it's you're
[33:10] going to have God's
[33:12] perspective you're going to have God's
[33:14] heart you're going to have God's mind
[33:15] and so when you see the things
[33:17] transpiring on earth you're going to
[33:19] think of it in the realm of the
[33:21] prophetic timetables and when are we
[33:23] going back we're ready when are we
[33:26] picking up our bodies again that's what
[33:28] you're thinking when is God going to
[33:30] fulfill his you know the Jewish people
[33:32] think when is he going to fulfill his
[33:34] vengeance upon these people that have
[33:35] persecuted us for
[33:38] Millennia if you're the bride you're
[33:39] saying when are we going to get on our
[33:41] horses and ride back and take this thing
[33:43] over amen see it's a to totally
[33:47] different perspective you know my my my
[33:51] dad asked me right after my mom passed
[33:54] away I was staying with him at his house
[33:56] does Mom know how sorry and sad we are
[33:59] right now I said well Dad I believe she
[34:02] does I believe she does and she sees
[34:06] what we're going through but she's awful
[34:07] busy greeting her family and so many
[34:09] different people there and her
[34:11] perspective about it is very different
[34:14] now she know she she knows she sees and
[34:18] she has a heart for us but she see she
[34:20] also sees it won't be long till we're
[34:22] reunited won't be long till we're back
[34:25] together it's just a little while in in
[34:28] a perspective in our perspective man the
[34:30] days are long and the years years fly
[34:33] might fly by but the days are awful long
[34:36] and there's a whole lot of difficulties
[34:38] trials suffering sorrow between now and
[34:40] then but from the perspective of
[34:42] Eternity we'll say what in the world was
[34:44] I worried about what in the world was I
[34:47] so upset about what in the world did I
[34:48] think oh it's just never going to happen
[34:50] again why was I thinking like that why
[34:53] was I thinking I wouldn't see my mom
[34:54] again my my dad again my this why was I
[34:57] thinking
