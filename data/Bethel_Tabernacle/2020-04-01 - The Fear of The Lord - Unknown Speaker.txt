forevermore I mean praise the Lord god bless you certainly a privilege to be here in the house of the Lord if you have your Bible let's go to 2nd Kings chapter 6 I have to turn e 2nd Kings chapter 6 and we just want to begin reading here amen praise the Lord I don't have any PowerPoint today so we we just have a lot of scriptures so brother Joe or whoever we have amen that's the fastest on that on that machine you're gonna need to be real quick today because though we got we got quite a few to get to amen just the way the Lord dealt with my heart and I'd like to just speak to you here tonight on the fear of the Lord the fear of the Lord 2nd Kings chapter 6 and let's go ahead and look here and then we'll look let me just find where I want to begin verse 9 and the man of God sent in to the king of Israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for thither the Syrians are come down and the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned David to himself there not once nor twice therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel and one of his servants said none my lord o king but Elisha the Prophet that is in Israel tell us the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber and he said go and spy where he is that I may fetch him that I may that I may send and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is in Dothan therefore sent he threw their horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the cities about and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and going forth behold a host compassed the city both with chariots both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto Him alas my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and Elijah prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountains was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elijah and when they came down to Hill meal I she prayed unto the Lord and said smite this people I pray thee with blindness and they smote them with blindness according to the word of Elijah one more scripture scripture proverbs chapter 9 and verse 10 its proverbs chapter 9 and verse 10 give you just a second to get there mm-hmm very familiar Scripture but we thought just for our context here tonight it would be important to read it proverbs chapter proverbs chapter 9 verse 10 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding Lord Jesus we just bow our heads here before you Lord as your humble servant father I pray Lord we've we've worshipped you in our homes in this church no doubt Lord across the airwaves as I speak tonight many in different locations in different places Lord but your prophet told us distance doesn't mean a thing to you Lord it doesn't matter father he said that some of his greatest victory some of his greatest success was actually over a telephone praying for somebody Lord because distance doesn't mean anything to you Lord it doesn't physical the Holy Spirit doesn't matter the physical proximity we are to each other Lord wherever two or three are gathered in your name there you'll be in their midst so lord I pray right now father that you would go on the wings of this prayer may your spirit Lord touch every life that will hear this sermon here tonight whether it's recorded Lord or here live bless it now we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated thank you musicians an amazing story here that we find in second Kings chapter six and the Bible speaks here and we're gonna we're gonna refer back to this here in just a moment but I just want to bring the context out of this as the Lord has just led me in this direction Benna dad was the king of a country car the the country of Syria and the Bible says that he had declared a war against Israel and the scripture says that he had gathered all of his generals in his armies and he was going to attack Israel and the scripture says that he gathered them in his strategy room and he began to lay out a strategy and a plan of attack and the scripture says that two on two different times that after his Syria would go and invade and try to attack that it just seemed like that Israel was always one step ahead of him they always knew what was gonna come before it came they always was receiving warning before judgment and he couldn't figure this out and he said ah I don't know what's happening and and so he gathers all of his men and he says which one of you is a spy for Israel and which one of you is a traitor and they said none my lord there's none of us or a traitor but there's actually a man named Elijah who's a prophet and he hears the words that you speak in your bedchamber friend do you realize the ability of a prophet a seer God sent us a prophet in this generation and that prophet exposed the tactics and the strategies of the devil that's why the Bible that's why brother Brandon said Satan above everything hates the revelation of the Word of God but we love it because it exposes the strategy of Satan let me tell you God has not been taken by off guard he's not caught by surprise by anything that's happened in our world today nothing God is not shocked he is not alerted but he already knew it before it would come and my brother my sister we shouldn't be alarmed we shouldn't be surprised we should have a shalom arrest knowing that before the devil ever strategizes a plan to afflict or to attack God has already exposed him says show me the trader none my lord there's no trader here but there's a prophet in Israel and and so now that he knows this the scripture says that Benna dad says go and fetch him seek him and fetch him and so he you know go to Dothan him and find him and so he dispatches horses and the Bible says horses and chariots and they go to attack to try to capture Elijah I'm just gonna take this jacket off here they go to try to capture this prophet the seer who's exposing all of his plans and the scripture says he says go to go to Dothan and and and capture him and and so the Bible says that they go in the night and then the cover of darkness and they they surround the city and the scripture says that Elijah away Elijah a servant woke up you know what they were trying to do is they were trying to take you light ship by surprise take him off guard but the Bible says that that they surround him and Elijah serve it woke up early in the morning and he sold that the scripture says a host which means a mighty army had surrounded all of is all of all of Israel and the scripture says he runs to Elisha the prophet him and he's terrified he's in panic he's and fairies and pandemonium and and he says alas my master what shall we do we are surrounded this was his words we are surrounded and you know confident there was a confidence that he likes you had he wasn't worried he wasn't stirred he wasn't in panic he just looked at his servant and he said fear not pick it up here in verse and look at 2nd Kings chapter 6 brother Joe and and look here he says fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them I should pray notice and said Lord open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened his the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountains was full of horses and chariots of fire not out in front not behind but surrounding him when the devil thinks he's got you surrounded God has got you surrounded by an army of angels and chariots says that he's surrounded with chariots of fire round about Elisha you know this was something that David could say a David had such an assurance when he Lysa would say fear not it was with confidence there was an assurance because Elijah had peered into the dimension he had peered into another dimension you notice it wasn't it wasn't he wasn't telling Elijah or the servant you know to open his eyes to look physically because when he looked around him physically around the world it looked like pandemonium it looked like he was surrounded it looked chaotic but he said open his eyes in other words let him look into another dimension let him realize that this battle that we face is not a flesh and blood battle you know they've labeled this coronavirus kovin 19 they've given it a name but the prophet of God told us and said that that that those are just scientific medical terms they give but what we understand is that it's a demon spirit out of the fourth dimension it's a satanic assault we don't fear we don't fight flesh and blood we fight principalities spiritual warfare spiritual wickedness in other in another dimension and so Elijah's not saying I want you to I want you to open his eyes naturally but he's saying open his eyes give him this confidence open his eyes into another dimension and let him realize that while there may be demons there's also angels while there may be a devil there's also a God who's still on the throne and who still has authority and power in this generation Elisha David could have the same exact type of confidence david says in psalms chapter 3 verse 6 he says i will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me we're gonna need to be fast here I'm gonna just go through these like a blaze he says I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me round a bow this is the confidence of the psalmist I'm not going to be afraid I don't fear like the world fear though and notice what he says in Psalms 27 verse 3 he says though a host should encamp against me a host meaning an army he says though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will I be confident Psalms 55 verse 18 he says he hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me for there were many with me Psalms 55 18 he hath delivered my soul not my body your subject to fear in this fallen flesh but in the midst of that fear God can deliver your soul in peace and you can have a peace that passes understanding and he says he's delivered my soul how because there were many with me he's speaking of an angelic host I say here tonight is a preach to you and maybe this would be your desire in your prayer Lord in the midst of all this chaos in this panic open my eyes Lord that I can see and behold that in another dimension while there may be spirits I object neither make spirits assaulting and invading the world there's an angelic army of angels to those who fear the name of the Lord you know the Old Testament Saints knew God in this special way in the end and then the Bible says that you know that we know him as what is we know him as Savior we know him as Lord we know him as son of man we know him as the Lord Jesus Christ but you'll notice there's a term in the Old Testament that you find all the way from the book of Samuel all the way to the book of Malachi God is referred to over 200 times as the Lord of hosts Lord of hosts will pick up just a few of these in Psalms 46 7 the Lord of Hosts is with us the God of Jacob is our refuge and sums 89 verse 8 Oh Lord God of hosts who is strong who is a strong tower like unto thee or to they or to thy faithfulness round about Lee that was some 89 8 and somes 84 8 he says Lord God of hosts hear my prayer these are just a few of these David would refer to him as the Lord God of hosts in Psalms 24 and verse 10 David says the Lord of hosts he is the king of glory so they understood him by as this name the Lord of hosts the scripture says that David would wax great and greater and greater in battle because the Lord this is the verse because for the Lord was with him he was he was with him in a specific attribute of his character and that attribute was the Lord of Hosts or the Lord who surrounds the Hebrew word for host and I don't know Hebrew so I'm probably going to pronounce this with some good southern English understanding but the Lord of Hosts this word host is spelled TSB aah oh you could pronounce it BA the Lord of hosts and I only say that because their significance in the meaning of this name the Lord of hosts it means an army an army that's important right they're an army ready and poised for battle an army ready and poised not now think of this definition when David would say Oh Lord God of hosts he would say the Lord God of hosts is with us not a singular but an army ready and poised for battle it means soldiers horses chariots army ready at any moment to do war for the Lord an army assembled and waiting for instructions this is how Elisha had could have confidence because he knew the Lord of Hosts this is how David could have confidence because he knew the Lord of Hosts yareta in Hezekiah and this is Hezekiah who is king of Judah you can read over in the book of second chronicles and the scripture speaks here we can turn there if you want and second chronicles chapter 32 brother Joe if you could pull that up Hezekiah was when he was surrounded very much like Elijah he was surrounded by an Assyrian army an army much greater in Sun size and a number and the Bible says that Hezekiah was surrounded by the Assyrians and second chronicles 32 verse 7 notice what he says here this is the words from Hezekiah hey wait for you to have it Jones is too good second chronicles chapter 30 scepter 32 verse 7 second chronicles there we go thank you he says be strong and courageous be not afraid nor dismay now this was mentioned by Hezekiah it was mentioned by David it was mentioned by Elisha but it was actually they were only repeating they didn't think of this it wasn't a sudden thought David wasn't repeating the words of Elijah they weren't repeating the words of each other but this was actually a command that God had given to the children of Israel under Moses and he said this was a command it wasn't a suggestion it wasn't some good advice this was actually a command that the Lord gave him and said don't fear don't be afraid it was a command don't be afraid jesus said the same thing in matthew 10 he said don't fear Him who can destroy the body but fear Him who can't read both the body and soul this was a command that he was giving them don't fear that's what David would repeat it fear not that's why I see as soon as he's seen a server who was panicked and in chaos he likes you immediately the first words he doesn't say calm down he doesn't say hold on a minute he doesn't say what's happening he says fear not that'll always drive the spirit of fear out of your life fear not notice what he says should be strong and courageous be not afraid door nor dismayed for the king of Assyria nor for all notice this nor for all the multitude that is with him for there be more with us than with him now here's an important part with him is an arm of flesh but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles what a promise don't be afraid with film as an arm of flesh with helm as an arm of flesh but with us is the Lord is what with us as chariots no with us as an as a vaccine no with us is with us as some army some great trained fighters no but here's what we do have the Lord of Hosts the Lord mighty in battle he says here know the Old Testament noticed this this was a rest and I noticed what it says here he says the king of Judah verse 9 brother Joe he says a little meeting I'm sorry go back I'm sorry verse 8 notice this he says with him is an arm of flesh but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles and the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah the king of Judah what did we receive in this generation it wasn't some doctrine or some good ideas or some theology but we received Shalom rest little bride and we can have rest in the midst of calamity we can have peace to our delivered to our soul doesn't mean that you're not listen my brother my sister yeah it doesn't mean that you're not you can't you're always susceptible to be afraid that's part of your fallen nature but God is saying don't fear fear not fear them not for the Lord of Hosts is with us then you notice they would rest upon the words they would rest upon this vision because they couldn't see it with her eyes I want you to catch this here today they couldn't see it physically and you can't see an army of angels physically but they rested on the Asian that the word was giving them this word projects a vision to you you don't ever have to see with your eyes or touch it with your hands but it's pretend projecting a vision and their rest was upon the vision that the word created in their spirit and they would rest upon this Lord of Hosts the Lord you know what that means it means the god of Angel armies the god of angelic armies and notice here they would rest upon these it was an unseen but it was a prepared and poised for battle for their protection and sums 121 and verse 5 David would boast and notice what he says here in Psalms chapter 121 brother Joe versus private I'm gonna wait for you to pull it up Psalms 1 21 verse 5 he says here the chariots of God notice the chariots of God sums 1 21 verse 5 this is really good oh it's too too good just to miss Psalms 121 if you have a Bible that'd be good you could you could use that notice the chariots of God psalms 121 I got that wrong I'd I have it Psalm 68 17 I'm sorry Joe I had my next one so get that one ready also listen to this sums shout psalms psalms chapter 68 verse 17 Psalm 68 and notice good notice the chariots of God this was the vision of the Almighty the chariots of God are 20,000 even thousands of angels son army even thousands of angels and the Lord this is the best part is among him and the Lord is among them who is the Lord he's the same one who appeared to Joshua he said are you forced to fry adversary said neither I'm the captain of the Lord's host I'm the general of the army the Lord is among him notice what he says here he says he says there 20,000 Lord is among them now Psalms chapter 20 21 verse 5 brother Joe Psalms 1 21 and verse 5 notice what he says here he says he says the Lord is thy keeper the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand the Lord is thy keeper this is really important here Peter would use the same exact word and and in 1st Peter chapter 1 and verse 5 Peter would say in PA first Peter 1 in chapter 5 a virtue first Peter chapter 1 verse 5 he says we are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation we are kept this is the same word that David uses and said the Lord is thy keeper he's thy shade upon thy right hand this is first Peter he says he says here we are kept by the power of God through faith unto saving unto salvation unto salvation ready to be posed are you with me an army waiting ready for battle we are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time that's a prophecy for right now you see last time you say right now I notice what he says here even Jesus and in John 17 turned there and John 17 verse 12 Jesus would use the same word here and he would say father he begin to pray this and he says in John 17 verse 12 he says when I was with him I kept them there's that keeping power when I was with while I was with him in the world I kept them in thy name when I was with them I kept them in thy name those who thou has given me I have kept and none of them is lost none of them is lost so the Bible doesn't say that sciples were keeping themselves when they were even with Jesus they're in flesh but Jesus says I've been keeping them I've been protecting them I've been keeping them they didn't you better not be keeping yourself in this generation but you better be kept by the power of God ready to be revealed in the last days they're kept by what by an angelic army else they are kept by something outside of themselves they couldn't have made it one single day without this promise while I was in the world those whom thou give us me I have kept and not one of them is lost what a prayer he says in in verse 15 he says I pray not that thou should take vil notice this year I pray not that thou should has take them out of the world why Jesus we can all say Lord just rapture us right now Lord just take us home right now why do we even got to go through this Jesus says huh you got a purpose here I know I'm not gonna pray that that I take you out of the world but here's what I'm gonna pray he says I'm not gonna pray not that thou should take them out of the world but that thou should ask EEP guard protect surround surround them from the evil you know evil as evil as a part of prophecy in the Bible we know that the world is unraveling that's what we're seeing here today we're seeing a runnin raveling a complete and total unraveling of the entire world systems even Jesus would predict this in Luke chapter 21 verse 25 Jesus would predict this and say that that that the last day the end times would be a day of unprecedented fear in fact it would be said the fear you think the people are afraid right now and in panic right now jesus said the fear would become so potent that their heart would stop from fear he says in Luke 21 verse 25 brother Joe he says that there would be an age of unprecedented fear notice what he says here he says upon the earth distress of nations distress with perplexity men distress perplexity would be too good words to describe the looks upon the conference distress and perplexed the sea in the waves Rory noticed this is a period of a prophecy of the tribulation here men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the power of heaven shall be shaken right Matthew 24 he answers three different questions but when he answers not that when he answers the question there he gives warnings also of what would happen and what would come what will be the sign of that coming water will be the end of the age and Jesus answers the question and he says nation will rise against nation Kingdom against Kingdom there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes and then he says all these are the beginning of Sorrows now the brides raptured right before that verse before the beginning of Sorrows or gone praise God men shall betray one another they shall hate one another false prophets are gonna rise deceiving many we know that was false anointed ones Jesus says iniquity is going to abound then he says he says that the love of many is going to wax or grow cold this was all prophecies then shall be Great Tribulation such as never eyes nor shall ever be for there there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders watch notice watch therefore for you know not what hour your Lord doth come what you're seeing today in the entire world is a state of of no matter whether it's believers or unbelievers or saved or unsaved you're seeing the entire world witness the birth pains the contractions of tribulation I heard a you know the brother who wrote the poem there and for the mother from Africa said it's this is welcome to the dress rehearsal what a fitting way to describe what's happening right now heard another brother had preached it and he said it's he said it's like a what you're witnessing today said it's a precursor it's they said it's like a you ever watched a storm off in the distance and he says and you could see you're not in the store maybe it's still sunshine where you're at but he says you see the darkness the clouds get darker and darker as they gather he said you can even start to hear the Thunder in the distance and he said you can see the lightning even begin to strike though it's not there he said this is what do you want to know what this cove at 19 it's the brewing of the tribulation it's the coming that's not here yet but it's brewing these aren't tribulation or plagues because I'm still here and you're still here but it's the brewing of a storm it's a learning before judgment and the entire world is in panic and they're in fear and they're in perplexity and if you're not careful my brother my sister you may not have coronavirus you may not get coronavirus you you may not be in panic and buying toilet paper and paper towels and you may not be doing any of that but if you're not careful you can ingest the atmosphere of fear just by turning on your television if you're not careful just by taking in so much always looking for what's on the news and what's happening now on and and aunt Lee in answer I am guilty as well watching every picture here the press conference here the governor did you hear that president hear what they said and y'all can almost just and if you're not careful you begin to ingest so much of that that you may never physically fill it but in your spirit you starting to feel that that little unease and unrest we got to be careful it's good to be informed but you better be balanced with how much you're taking in I'd say with every minute of the press conference you better be reading a minute of the Word of God a better ever every minute you hear the governor you better have a minute here in the prophet of God here in the Word of God that's your Shalom that's your rest notice it was there's an age of fear and and worry and and and you know what it is even Americans it's so amazing to me you know why the all this panic and pandemonium because America's such people's rights and that in a not just America but the end world as the age gets darker they worship life this life they literally worship this life and they do anything they can to prolong this life as much as they can that's why you don't see you you and I'm not getting into this this vain of thinking but you don't you don't you don't see the kind of precautions we're taking today you didn't see it and in the 1800's when they had the Vietnam when anyone but whatever that virus was called his Fanus flew and and you know all about all the different things it wasn't it wasn't you know you know what it was there wasn't as much worship of life as there is today they looked at death as a doorway to a better life say brother man is it wrong to want to live no by no means that's inside of you that's natural to want to live because you're gonna live one day and never die and live one day and never die but but we worship we worship material things think about this the people are an absolute rebellion people especially in the south or an absolute rebellion even our own governor other other governors shutting down quarantine shelter in place stay in your homes and arrow even our own governor I'm doing everything you can to impose to impose that and not not in put any kind of strict regulations and and try to just bid try you know let's just stay positive goes go as far as we came with precaution as to maintain some decent happiness what are they afraid of being in their houses my brother my sister if we're not if we'd be honest we can be guilty of the same thing to where we're almost stir-crazy what's happened to us we've gone if we've just on the treadmill of life we've gotten so used to go go go go go go go go go go go and then God says Paul's and everyone's just like I can't do this I got a snack I gotta go we gotta go we gotta go we gotta go can't stop Trump saying can't stop we got to keep it going all right we got to get to get this country back on gotta get it going what is it they love that treadmill they love that rat race want to go go go go go don't stop don't slow down I'm chasing something I'm seeking something you're messing up my plan they're not ready for this even just a little 15-day 30-day quarantines stay in your homes everyone shelter in place for 15 days it's just it's just unbelievable they could never fathom it should tell you where we're at in this country and it's and it's getting worse the world is constantly evolving they're getting worse and worse and worse and a panic and ependymal and you look even as you see it there's there's a rapid acceleration and I know you know you can go off balance with this but let me just say this there's a rapid acceleration in the world if you just follow weather look at the weather patterns we've had here in Buford with hurricanes over the last just few years we've been here twenty-something plus years and we've had warnings of hurricanes but never real any damage only in these last few years that we had hurricane after hurricane after hurricane unpredictable weather patterns you think that's what is he said by than that what does that mean it just means the Bible once again has been proven to be true that the scripture says nature is traveling groaning within itself even even death nature even nature's groaning and travailing within itself ready to be delivered birth pains contractions ready to rid itself of sin we see it in the world it's a a number of you could think of calamities and hurricanes and tornados and earthquakes and and if you watch earthquakes happening more rapidly now right now you say global warming God believe in global warming a hundred percent I'm a believer in global warming now let don't believe it's caused by what the Democrats say it's caused by but the world is absolutely falling apart this was what the Prophet told us your body's falling apart the earth is falling apart man has destroyed the earth why would why why would we be surprised by that it's right in the Word of God probably going to get in trouble for that one okay it's it's it goes it right in line with what I believe the world's falling apart and it's happening just over the last few years you can see a rapid acceleration towards just disaster after disaster after disaster things happen and so you know what the Bible says in Ecclesiastes it said in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth and knowledge increases in sorrow and the more man has fed upon the tree of knowledge and good and evil the more sorrow has increased in the world and I preached on that here today but I believe it's absolutely true it's a world ingested and panic and pandemonium and in fear you notice even when Moses is going to give the Ten Commandments and they come down to the very end of that if you look all the way down there and maybe maybe just to do it we'll just turn to it brother Joe let's turn to Exodus chapter 20 and and notice what it says there next is chapter 20 and this I'm just gonna read the very in and verse 18 it says in all the people Moses gives all these Commandments and it says and all the people heard the thunderings and they seen the Lightning's and and they they hear the noise of the trumpet in the mountains smoking it when the people saw it they remove they step back they stood afar off they said unto Moses - don't stones you need you don't do that again you need to be the one to speak to us they were afraid they were quaking in fear and he says but don't let God speak to us lest we die and Moses notice verse 20 and Moses said unto the people fear not for God has come to prove you which means to test you and that that his notice that his fear so there's a unhealthy fear but then there's a healthy fear we love to quote the scripture that the angels of the Lord are surrounding us that that word that word that were surrounded but the Bible says it this way the lord encamps them that fear him so you want to have a press not just given to anybody I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of God so the Lord you know it just surrounds me no the Bible says there's a the Angels in camp around those who fear the Lord who feared the name what is that fear remember what we said last Sunday in Sunday school it's not a terror like Saul the Bible says Saul was in terror he was in panic he wasn't he was in fear but fear fear is not fear like this in the sense of being afraid but fear is the awareness of the presence of a living God that's what it means to fear the Lord that you recognize that he's real that you're accountable then that did not what did what is the following verse a he says that his fear may be before your face is that here's the purpose that you sin not if you don't believe the Lord is as he says his fear may be before your faces his presence his glory that he's here if you don't believe in that then you just live any way that you want to live but if you fear the Lord you're aware of a hull of a holy God you're aware of a righteous God who desires righteousness and holiness from your life the fear of the Lord is to recognize that say Lord you're here in the midst of it all you're here I have an awareness that you're here that you never leave me you never forsake me it's an awareness brother Branham said they don't recognize they don't reverence the presence of God because they don't recognize the presence of God are you here so there's a healthy fear an unhealthy fear he says that he says that you may receive this is what he says that his fear may be before your face is that you send up now notice how Paul in Hebrews do brother Joe hebrews chapter 12 and verse let's just read here verse 18 he's gonna parallel this notice what he says here Hebrews chapter 12 verse 18 for you are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fir you're not coming to the mount that might be touched and that burned with fires speaking there what we just read an exodus nor until blackness and darkness contempt us and the sound of the trumpet the voice of words which voice that they that heard and treated that the words should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it should be stoned or thrust with the dart and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and quake but you are come to Mount Zion and to the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company you know the company is the Bravo Company the Alpha Company you're come to the innumerable company it's a heavenly host that's why God says the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name the Lord is a man of Gerrits are are thrown in and going through the entire world today streaming in all the world in another dimension it's an angelic battle that's taking place right now he says you're come on to Mount Zion I'm so glad for that to an innumerable company of angels to the General Assembly in the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to the God and to God the judge of all and this to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel notice this here he says in verse 26 whose voice then shook the earth but now he have promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth but also only but also heaven and this word well yet once more signifies the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve God except ibly with reverence and godly fear so we said the entire world is shaking it's a cloud of panic it's a cloud of pandemonium it's a cloud of chaos and uncertainty it's paralyzing the entire world that we're living in let me tell you what Jesus says here is we just turn a corner and we close notice what Jesus says here and I want you to turn to Matthew chapter 10 quickly their brother Joe if you've got it Matthew chapter 10 I want you to notice what he says here in verse 28 he says and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but instead fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell now notice how he follows this up this is this is a command to the disciples fear not he says notice he injects this right here are not two sparrows two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father but the hairs now is gonna change from sparrows to hairs but the hairs of your head are all numbered fear you not therefore you are more valuable than many sparrows whosoever therefore shall confess me now notice this he uses this example in fear not and he's gonna use this Sparrow right a book of a man who was speaking about the sparrows it was so powerful some of the some of what if you study just a sparrow and this is the word bird you of sparrows and and and notice what it says it's this it's this delicate bird this little this is the bird Jesus uses this little delicate Sparrow sparrows known for their music you ever go out in the morning and you hear the sparrows just if you have bushes especially you could hear them just you don't see them but you can just hear them and they're singing and cooing and they all have different Tunes and different melodies sing in different pitch but they they're known for their music they actually sing in as many as 22 Birds there's song sparrows larks vesper sparrows white-throated Sparrow z-- and all of them have to do with their names have to do with music and so notice if you look at the anatomy of a sparrow it's a thin I almost had a picture here but I didn't have time to put it up there bones are small little bones strong and they're there they're specifically designed for flying even scientists today has not matched or mimic or been able to replicate the anatomy of it the structure of a spare of how how smooth they fly and they they might say they they can they can fly and migrate over 2,000 miles every year a sparrow has between one thousand three hundred to two thousand and six hundred feathers over 2,600 feathers they're detailed you know why cuz we had a detailed God who detailed ly he designed them by detail every bone they're perfect every feather and the Bible says he counted every single one every single fair every single sparrow and you know miss sparrows love to nest in the ground and so when those days you know that they would trap them this is why you hear David in Psalms 91 when David would say we all should not be afraid of the snare of the Fowler you've heard of the snare of the Fowler in the Bible it's because in biblical days they didn't have a shotgun the ground and and Jesus could look in the market even there they were selling sparrows he's speaking to them he would use common things around them and he's speaking of these of these sparrows that would become trapped and they would they would become trapped in these traps him and they would be today what they would be I killed and then and notice what he says here Jesus says out of all these birds out of all the birds in the earth your father now you blanket the human head and I know some of you have lost some of the host and that's not your number and maybe you have way less of a number but even even even a person who is bold they're Sciences feathers even avail us of hair which is unseen by the human eye it has thousands of hair underneath it and Jesus says notice it wasn't just hair wasn't just yet God didn't give you hair just just a you know furred for beauty you over your eyes are there to prevent sweat but from going directly into your eyes because if you read sweat in your eyes and you bribe browse a few have extraneous workout the eyebrows were there God put them there for a purpose to keep sweat even the eyelashes they too close to your eyebrow that senses those nerves since it in your eyes closed tiny little bitty hairs inside of your ear inside of your nostrils to prevent particles and things that would be harmful for you come in and turn inside of your body what was it every even if you look at a picture of hair and you look at an acre scope it has a circular of veins going through it a little cylinder cells that go around that hair total deep down into the skin to read there's a around each one of those hair has little blood vessels that nourish each one of those hairs every hair and muscles nerves clans that support it it's amazing if you look at in the encyclopedia look at a picture could you could look at it Wikipedia and you can see the human hair in the cross sections that that go through in the mirror has different hair the little rings of tissues that surround every single chunk of hair even the way that color is determined the colors determined by by a system I'm not even going to try to pronounce some of these scientific words but a little small cluster of glands drains into every single hair that that produces a certain chemical that gives your hair a certain color God is intricately designed it and remember Matthew 10 they're not and he's going to use the sparrow and he's gonna say even the hairs of your head are numbered you know what now I know why David could say I am he says I am fearfully and wonderfully made the God took time he took plan and in Jesus formed the human body he numbered every single hair Colossians says for by him we're all things created without him was nothing created and in him through him do all everything both animate inanimate consists and has its beam you know Jesus could have looked at Peter and he could have he could have absolutely looked at Peter and said Peter let me tell you something don't fear let me tell you something on yourself Peter you have two hundred thousand 649 317 hairs on your head and your left eyebrow you have 100,000 four or whatever would be and your right eyebrow you have 962 and your left eye and your left eye you have you have you know 439 eyelashes Jenny was looking at the next disciple on him he could he could start telling them how many hairs they have on their body he could have looked at him and said James there's over there's over 100 27 tire 2,000,000 339,000 sparrows in the world today and in the market right now there's 933 of them for sale you know Holly could have said that because he said I've numbered every one of your hairs I've counted every single sparrow and I see every one that falls not one falls to the ground without your father in Heaven's knowledge that's why I says be careful for nothing don't be anxious over anything you worry over food and rain knit and clothing and coronavirus and these viruses that come in the world and the world's falling apart don't fear there's a God who sees every Sparrow counts every hair and let me tell you something what Jesus said he says you're more valuable than every sparrow I've put more value I've put don't be careful for anything trust me Peter trust a God who can number the hairs on your head trust the God who can count every single sparrow trust him in the middle of your calamity trust him in the middle of the storm trust him in the middle of perplexity upon the world fear not that was his words fear him David picks this up and I'm running out of time can I have just a few more minutes I heard I've ready at home said preach for the man Psalms chapter 40 verse 5 notice what David says here Psalms chapter 40 verse 5 he says many Oh Lord noticed this many Oh Lord my God are thy wonderful works which thou has done and thy thoughts which are to us-ward they cannot be reckoned up in order the thoughts that you have towards us cannot be reckoned up in order into the if I would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered and Psalms 139 verse 17 how precious also are thy thoughts unto me O God how great is the sum of them if I could count them they're more in number than the sand the precious thoughts God's has towards you and you're worried even in Jeremiah we know the scripture there in Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 he says I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected in God thought of you when you were born he thought of you before you were born did you realize that even before you were born David says in Psalms chapter 20 a charged chapter 139 notice what David says here in Psalms 139 verse 16 he says thine eyes did it see Psalms 139 then Psalms 139 verse 16 the verse right before that brother Joe he says thine eyes did see my unformed substance yet being and all thy book all my members were written when his yet they were none of them even before I was made you already thought of me and already seen me he says in Psalms 22 verse 9 thou took me out of the womb thou did make me hope when I was upon my mother's breast I was cast upon thee from the womb thou are my God from my mother's belly thou art my god from my mother's belly that's what the lyrics of the song say I'm no longer a slave to fear from my mother's womb you have thought of me you've called me your own you place me you claim to me you've protected me you're keeping me you're watching me there's a host of angels surrounding me at all times are you glad for that Saints Lord thinks of you every part of you he thinks of your health he thinks of your well-being mentally emotionally physically spiritually he's a God who cares he's the God who keeps he's a God who protects us glad I got his protection over my life I can't comprehend that that God knows in numbers every single one of my hairs I can't even fathom that that he knows every Sparrow that falls I can't fathom that but here's the vision of the word of the Lord coming to me you're more valuable than all of that place more value on you those that fear the name of the Lord there's a host surrounding them at all times he keeps them he's the Lord thy keeper John I pray that thou should not take them out of the world but as thou should has keep them from the evil you know what keeping English has meanings there it means to retain possession to protect and preserve but when Jesus said I pray that thou shalt first John or John at first John but John 17 verse 15 he says I pray not that thou should has take them out of the world but that thou should keep them from the evil keep them from the evil that word keep in the Greek I don't know Greek I'm gonna pronounce this word wrong it's Furio it means this is what it means when he says don't take him out of the world but keep them to keep means to establish a military outpost to guard to him in to protect with a garrison it's second definition means to establish a fortress with a full military fortress with a full military apparatus it's third meaning means to discern the enemy father in advance and protect from Jay danger this is the prayer Jesus prayed over you don't take him out of it but while they're in an evil world that's falling apart surround them Oh God protect them Oh Lord the name of the Lord is a strong tower that the righteous run into and are safe glad I'm safe here today but I got safekeeping a God who keeps me protects me he's the god of Angel armies as I close here today I and I could got much more wicked we could even read David just as the Psalms are just filled with it but I just I want to come to a close here you know even before this we we had our just surround just gathered there with with my wife and children there at home and I begin to we just was doing just a little devotion and a little morning Bible study with the kids and the Lord the night before it came to me at Friday this is lie about a week ago Lord he came to me and I'm not a dreamer don't believe I have the gift never seen a gift of Dreams in my life and there was not even anything that was you know prophecy of any kind but the Lord just all night long I just was like one dream after the next after the next and and there that you know they weren't wasn't there wasn't really any necessarily anything any rhyme or reason to the connection between East each of them but the Lord has begin to deal with my heart I woke up morning and and the Lord took me to Joseph in Egypt and and there he is and and the Bible says that there he is in prison and and the and the Baker you know the story the baker and the butler and then the butler comes back he go he he gets out of jail and Joseph still in jail and and he and he comes to the King begins to have these dreams the dreams of the you know the fat cows and and and he says there were seven fat cows and he says seven skinny cows and he says and then the fat cows there's the skinny cows ate the fat cows but they didn't become fat and then he said there were seven heads like of wheat and he says and they were all withered all set you any it's Joseph over since idiot II he there's of plenty when there were increased Hey and put away and he built during that time and he builds up and builds up when it seemed Joseph don't we have enough keep throwing it in keep throwing and then seems like a bad gonna be big get more build them higher Bible says later in the story that famine those seven years and in the seven years of famine and drought Joseph could see ahead and in the good times could have wisdom to put up for a and we know I had a great but the Lord began to tell me oceans there and I just begin to say you know I don't know the Lord just begin to our pastor spoke about the treadmill and I thought was he's he's turned at a million miles an hour times how fast your life is going not the nation we live in but our life is just going at a million miles an hour it's almost like a you know that when they're making a movie and you know they say action and everyone's moving and there's a then suddenly hey I cut and we'll stop rollin in the camera stop and I said in that just feel like that's exactly what's happened to us here go inna you know just as fast as it can go in that car I said you can get in the car now our down the highway and if your car will allow you to we'll stay right there moving in a hundred and thirty miles in and out of the car and and and move your position say stay smooth and that coffee for everyone's turned up this is what it feels like that and I'm sure all of you filled our children that were at school or at home slowed and and some of you who slowing down and some people you're home all the time and it just feels like your your routines you were in chasing your next opportunity chasing the next thing raising kids raising life looking ahead which you should be doing all of these things but suddenly that does it just the the director says cut and then and that car comes to a screeching halt and I said I just felt like everything has just been turned upside down but the voice well voice the Lord begin to say take take an opportunity out of this time to put things in order that maybe have been out of order for a way too long I've said cut just for a moment and then and and and the routines of life are disposed and slowed down here for a moment and the Lord began to speak and say start putting things in order start changing things look and assess your life assess everything around and the Lord said I'm going to stop the vehicle because there's certain things you need to or rearrange that you couldn't rearrange you tried but you couldn't rearrange them when you were going a million miles an hour but now I've given you this reprieve don't look at the I told my family I said the entire world is is going to go through this coronavirus and we're gonna go through it with them we're gonna go through it right with them and and we're gonna get on the other side of it things are going to get back to normal and that treadmills gonna you know what it's gonna be going 100 miles an hour and I said and everyone's gonna have a reaction to everything that's happened in the world today and and let me say this let me go further and say this this this this this pandemic that's striking that the nation it means something to the world and maybe it doesn't mean the same thing to us but it does mean something and I'm not trying to put significance to what it means but it should I asked my family I said what what should we need to ask the Lord and I challenge you here tonight to say Lord what is it what it what does it mean it doesn't mean it's not fair and pandemonium for me we have Shalom we have rest but what did what are you trying to do what is what is this in my life you know the Psalms 91 is a favorite Scripture we love to quote you know we know all that we've quoted it through all of this and you know a thousand will fall it dies right side of the ten thousand on the left side but it shall not come nigh to the famine and pests I keep earn while all of these things are Famer to all of TOMS 91 is there is the is the condition david says he who dwell pulling up brother Joe Psalms 91 verse 1 he says secret of his Tabernacle shall abide verse one by the Jo notice this here you could quote all of the Scriptures by after that but here's the first he that dwelleth in the secret he that dwelleth in this then it follows up with all the next verses we want to claim all the next verses but but our weed welling in the secret place are weird well in in the under the secret place of the Most High that's how you have those promises come to your life are you dwelling in the secret of his tabernacle or in your home is there there things that you've chased after and everyone wants protection he's an owl protect us Lord we got a token apply but are you are you applying a fresh coat I'm not asking challenging myself what are we doing different we have leaven in our home you won't protect him from the death you from this this is a death angel it's killing people you won't protect him from the pestilence and the plagues and you want God to be your keeper and God to be your surrounder where are you dwelling in the secret place of the Most High or are we dwell in in Lady osya with the entertainment of the world and the word is last place and the quotes and the tapes tapes of the prophet or last place till suddenly calamity strikes and then we're rolling those things man no we're all really praising and shouting here just a minute ago it's just that it's just it's it's a question I'm asking myself I'm not putting you out now I'm computing my own selfie what is what we all want the protection but what is our life look like you think God's gonna protect you and you ain't got the token applied to your home I see Lord let me let me let me take an opportunity let me change the things that need to change while the show is paused let me put things in order in my life what can I go through and look at and and and and take a inventory and take a candle and go through the home and try to find 11 in the house I just tell me what the Lord told me and said you could you try to change these things in your life before and you couldn't so I've stopped everything and I'm giving you just a minute times don't go all the way through this thing and the treble start and you didn't change anything but I said Lord what can I grow from this the press conference I heard the the press the president something I think it was the they're the FDA doctor there and and they said you know well what's gonna what's gonna happen are we ever gonna go back to normal well things ever go back will we ever gather back in here and and sort of a rhetorical question there but are we ever gonna you know his things we go ahead and Trump has said well no I he said I think I think there will be certain things that are changed forever he said I think there are certain things that will never go back to we're gonna look at hygiene differently we're gonna look at when we shake someone's hand differently he says well I think everything is going to be he says I think there's going to be changes that you see that'll it'll be beyond cova 19 the Lord just spoke to me right there and said there needs to be things that you change now that are never the same when this thing resumes there needs to be certain ways that you look at certain things I tell you what it's going to change our approach and our attitude to come into the house of God to give a fresh appreciation for the family of God and one another and each other and fellowship and in harmony being here not just on Sundays but on Wednesdays being at prayer meetings because we can't have them right now got those men's breakfast we love them we can't have all right now you don't know what you got till you lose it but the Lord began to speak to me in to say change things now because it's gonna start again and those things I've given you this moment of reprieve to put things in order that have been out of order in your life musicians could you come stand to your feet let's just bow our heads together amen Lord Jesus at homes father in this church here Lord we've been affected by your word Lord we've been we've been challenged here tonight what is the fear of the Lord there's a good fear Lord you've taught us and then there's an unhealthy fear or not we don't fear what they fear Lord we don't we don't we don't panic like they panic we don't look at these things like the world looks at these things we have a different perspective we have a different way to look at it Lord but let us here tonight take a fresh look and say Lord but is what does it mean to fear the Lord does my life reflow this is mine is my reaction to all of this calamity in the world does it speak of the trust and the hope and the confidence I have in in the in and in the Lord or is my reaction been that of oh oh Lord the world's not looking for more doctrine Laura's not looking for the world's not looking for a better explanation of the creation Lord the church world does that they do good at that they debate the atheist and they debate the days of creation the debate the age of the the years and the the age of the earth and they do it Lord that's not what the world's hungry for they're not hungry for more doctrine or or how much knowledge we have or the better understanding or explanation or proof of of different things Lord but they're looking for somebody who could stand in the midst of calamity they're looking for a people who could stand in the midst when the rest of the world is shaking there's a bride who's resolute there's a people that is unfazed who doesn't fear though this thing who doesn't have a have a panic over what's happened in the world but has a strong assurance and a God who surrounding her a God who is protecting her a God who watches her and keeps her that's what the world's looking for Lord they're looking for a people who has faith and confidence and the promises of their God they're looking for someone who fears the Lord someone who has an awareness of a reality of a God who saves who keeps his alive who's the same yesterday today and forever O Lord I lift my hands here today maybe you there at home could lift your hands as you bow your heads those of you here maybe you could lift your hands and say Lord I choose to fear you Lord don't let me panic don't let me be a person who's in ingesting so much of this fear and pandemonium Lord but let me have wisdom in this our Lord let me let me Lord have a of strong faith open Lord this is my prayer as Elijah prayed open our eyes Lord that we can see that when the enemy comes rushing in like a flood the Spirit of God raises up a standard against it I want to be part of that safekeeping I want to be in that strong tower Lord I want to be in that holiest of holies I raise my hands and say that Oh God I want to be protected from the oncoming storm there's a light down in Goshen when the world's getting dark there's a token that's been given Lord and I pray that we'd make this up a Time Lord Lord that we reevaluate reassess this Lord as you spoke to my heart and said this isn't the famine the world is looking at this is pestilence and the stock market is a crashing but Lord you spoke to my heart so clearly and said this isn't the bad this isn't the famine they think this is bad world's gonna get worse this is just a storm brewing in the distance and Lord you begin to speak to my heart and say
