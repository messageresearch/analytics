[7:56] offering.
[8:03] Oh my god.
[8:34] Steve. Hey.
[8:39] [Music]
[8:57] was lying there. People all were
[9:01] weeping.
[9:04] They just left a Jesus when he said
[9:08] she's only sleeping.
[9:12] As he took her by the hand,
[9:16] she began to live again.
[9:20] Some began to praise the Lord. Some
[9:24] began to say,
[9:26] [Music]
[9:27] "He's in the house.
[9:31] Death has to flee.
[9:35] Now there is life
[9:39] where darkness used to be.
[9:43] Now there is hope.
[9:47] There's no more doubt.
[9:51] Praise his name.
[9:55] Praise his name.
[9:58] He's in the house.
[10:05] I was like that little girl
[10:08] dead and all my sin.
[10:12] Till Jesus touched this heart of mine
[10:16] and gave me life again.
[10:20] I am just a house of clay.
[10:24] Ever since that blessed day,
[10:28] there's a light that shines in me so all
[10:32] the world can see.
[10:38] He's in the house.
[10:41] Death has to flee.
[10:45] And now there is light.
[10:49] Where darkness used to be,
[10:53] now there is hope.
[10:57] There's no more doubt.
[11:01] Praise his name.
[11:05] Praise his name.
[11:08] He's in the house.
[11:12] And death has to flee.
[11:16] Now there is light
[11:19] where darkness used to be.
[11:24] Now there is hope.
[11:28] There's no more doubt.
[11:31] Praise his name.
[11:35] Praise his name.
[11:39] He's in the house.
[11:46] [Music]
[11:49] [Applause]
[11:50] [Music]
[11:51] [Applause]
[12:04] Lily,
[12:10] she's singing.
[12:28] Amen. Want to welcome all visitors.
[12:31] Pray that God would just bless you and
[12:34] let you know that he loves you and he'll
[12:36] keep you. So, uh, if you have a request
[12:39] upon your heart, I' I'd like to continue
[12:41] to remember my son. He's still doing
[12:43] great. He's just going to be greater and
[12:44] greater. Amen. Remember your loved ones,
[12:48] your children, your loved ones you want
[12:49] to see saved.
[12:52] Don't doubt.
[12:53] Just hold that token there.
[12:55] Amen.
[12:56] Amen. Let's pray. Father, I love you
[12:58] this morning. I thank you for your
[13:01] presence.
[13:02] Lord, we just pray that you would bless
[13:04] the tithes and offerings. And Lord, we
[13:07] offer up from our hearts burdens for our
[13:09] loved ones,
[13:11] our children, our parents, our brothers,
[13:14] and our sisters. Father,
[13:16] as we sang that song, we see how it is
[13:19] getting so dark,
[13:22] people groping in gross darkness.
[13:24] Father, we thank you for the light that
[13:26] you brought to us, Father, as our
[13:29] brother brought in the Sunday school.
[13:31] Father,
[13:33] the glory of pursuing the joy, the
[13:36] holiness, your will, your righteousness.
[13:39] Father,
[13:41] manifest yourself through us this day.
[13:43] Father, bless the tithes and offerings.
[13:46] Bless the cheerful giver. Bless those
[13:48] streaming. We thank you for your grace
[13:51] and mercy in Jesus' name. Amen.
[14:04] [Music]
[14:17] As I kneel in the darkness
[14:21] in the middle of the night,
[14:25] I'm praying for assurance.
[14:29] Everything's going to be all right.
[14:32] Lord, I see another battle.
[14:36] It's out in front of me
[14:40] and I'm afraid I won't be able
[14:44] and I'll go down in defeat. And he said,
[14:48] "Do you remember
[14:51] where I brought you from?
[14:55] Just take a look behind you and see how
[15:00] far you've come."
[15:02] And when every time you asked me,
[15:06] "Didn't I deliver you?"
[15:10] So why would you be thinking that I
[15:14] wouldn't see you through? Didn't I walk
[15:19] on the water and I calm the raging seas?
[15:25] I spoke to the wind
[15:28] and it hushed and I gave you peace.
[15:32] Didn't I run to your rescue? Didn't I
[15:36] hear you when you called?
[15:40] I've walked right beside you just so you
[15:45] wouldn't fall. Didn't I leave all of
[15:49] heaven
[15:51] just to die for your sin?
[15:55] I searched until I found you. Can I do
[15:59] it all again?
[16:04] Now she's talking to her father
[16:08] in a house that was once a home. She
[16:11] said, "My bills are coming due, Lord.
[16:15] And six days is not that long." She
[16:19] hears a voice so soft and low. It says,
[16:23] "I've moved like that before.
[16:26] And I'll do this little thing, child.
[16:30] And I'll give you so much more. Didn't I
[16:34] walk on the water?
[16:37] And I calm the raging seas.
[16:41] I spoke to the wind
[16:45] and it hushed and I gave you peace.
[16:48] Didn't I run to your rescue? Didn't I
[16:53] hear you when you called?
[16:56] I walked right beside you just so you
[17:01] wouldn't fall. Didn't I leave all of
[17:05] heaven just to die for your sin?
[17:11] I searched until I found you. And I do
[17:15] it all again. Didn't I walk on the
[17:20] water? And I calm the raging seas.
[17:26] I spoke to the wind
[17:29] and it hushed and I gave you peace.
[17:32] Didn't I run to your rescue? Didn't I
[17:37] hear you when you called?
[17:40] I walked right beside you just so you
[17:45] wouldn't fall.
[17:47] Didn't I leave all of heaven just to die
[17:53] for your sin?
[17:55] I searched until I found you. And I do
[18:01] it all
[18:02] again.
[18:08] [Applause]
[18:14] You said somebody else had a special,
[18:15] right? Who was that? Johnson's. Come on
[18:19] up. I think we can fit it in.
[18:34] Come on up.
[18:39] Somebody want this?
[19:20] All story um brother wrote he was going
[19:23] to give a short testimony about his one
[19:27] year spiritual birth and so we are just
[19:30] happy to sing this song with him as we
[19:32] love him as our dear brother in Christ
[19:36] I came to this church I I came here on a
[19:40] whim just
[19:42] hour and 30 minutes away from me and I
[19:47] I was seeking something searching for
[19:49] something and I couldn't find in
[19:50] Savannah. That's where I'm from. And
[19:54] I reached out to some people and they
[19:57] recommended this church and I've loved
[19:59] it ever since. Brother Luther's wife was
[20:01] the first person I met and she
[20:04] immediately took me to Brother Luther
[20:06] told me to sit down and
[20:10] Amen.
[20:10] Song service was incredible that day. It
[20:12] always is. I I love it here, y'all. I
[20:15] love it here.

[27:23] Amen. Give the Lord a hand this morning.
[27:27] Hallelujah.
[27:28] [Applause]
[27:29] [Music]
[27:30] [Applause]
[27:34] Amen.
[27:35] Amen.
[27:36] God bless you. Greet you in the name of
[27:38] the Lord. Happy to have you all here on
[27:40] a beautiful day. Amen.
[27:43] Always reminding people the sun is still
[27:45] up there. Don't forget. Amen. But uh
[27:48] we're going to believe for the the reign
[27:50] of the Holy Spirit. Amen. As much as we
[27:53] have the rain outdoors, it's kind of a
[27:56] catch thing for us because we have
[27:58] visitors and we're happy to have them
[28:00] here today. But um so in one sense to
[28:04] our visitors, it's kind of we say, "Man,
[28:07] we got visitors and it's raining."
[28:09] That's almost never true here.
[28:10] Especially on sun Sundays, it's always
[28:12] sunny. But then the good part is we have
[28:14] someone to blame it on.
[28:17] Amen. So I apologize to our visiting
[28:20] families, but you definitely will get
[28:22] blamed. Amen.
[28:24] Doesn't mean we don't want you to come
[28:26] back. We do. Amen. Praise the Lord. I
[28:28] enjoyed all of that wonderful singing
[28:31] today in that worship. Such a wonderful
[28:33] spirit. As soon as Brother Brad started
[28:35] up with that opening song, I had my
[28:37] speaker on in the back and wow, I just
[28:39] had to push back from my notes and raise
[28:41] up my hands. Oh my. And just begin to
[28:45] give glory to God as I felt his sweet
[28:48] spirit dipping down into the office.
[28:51] We're going to invite you to the fifth
[28:53] book in the Old Testament to the book of
[28:54] Deuteronomy.
[28:57] Amen.
[29:01] This fifth book is uh
[29:06] referred to as the five books, the
[29:08] Penetuk and written by Moses.
[29:10] Interestingly enough, uh there's a
[29:13] number of scholars who who really claim
[29:18] that it's more goes along with Joshua
[29:21] and on into the pilgrimage and the
[29:24] conquest of Canaan.
[29:27] Uh but traditionally it's it's connected
[29:30] all the way back to Genesis. And I I
[29:32] think the reason for that is is because
[29:34] it's such a transitional book because
[29:37] it's that's the time where God has
[29:39] literally brought to pass uh what he
[29:42] promised Abraham how that he would have
[29:45] a family and that you would see a nation
[29:47] coming out of a nation. It was like a
[29:50] bride is called out of a church. And uh
[29:53] and then they had a prophet on the
[29:54] scene. They had a pillar of fire. But
[29:56] then the prophet left the scene, but
[29:58] Joshua carried over. And that all takes
[30:00] place. That's all described in what
[30:02] we're going to read here. Amen. And so
[30:05] I'm looking forward to uh today's
[30:09] lesson. It's uh for me it'll be the
[30:12] opportunity to start a new series and I
[30:14] always look forward to that. So I want
[30:17] to begin today to take a thought. The
[30:20] time of the unsealing.
[30:22] The time of the unsealing.
[30:25] Amen. Let's read from Deuteronomy
[30:27] chapter 31.
[30:32] And Moses went and spake these words
[30:35] unto all Israel. This is God had visited
[30:37] him uh in chapter 30. And now Moses is
[30:41] bringing this message to the church. And
[30:44] Moses went and spake these words unto
[30:46] all Israel. And he said unto them, I am
[30:50] 120 years old this day. I can no more go
[30:54] out and come in. Also the Lord hath said
[30:57] unto me, Thou shalt not go over this
[31:00] Jordan.
[31:02] The Lord thy God, he will go before
[31:04] thee, and he will destroy these nations
[31:07] from before thee, and thou shalt possess
[31:10] them, and Joshua he shall go over before
[31:14] thee, as the Lord hath said. And the
[31:18] Lord shall do unto them, as he did unto
[31:22] Zion, and to all kings of the Amorites,
[31:24] and unto the land of them whom he
[31:27] destroyed. And the Lord shall give them
[31:29] up before your face, and ye may do unto
[31:32] them according unto all the commandments
[31:34] which I have commanded you. Be strong,
[31:37] and of a good courage. Fear not, nor be
[31:40] afraid of them. For the Lord thy God, he
[31:43] it is that doth go with thee, he will
[31:46] not fail thee, nor forsake thee. And
[31:50] Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto
[31:52] him, in the sight of all Israel, Be
[31:55] strong, and of a good courage, for thou
[31:58] must go with this people unto the land
[32:01] which the Lord hath sworn unto their
[32:03] fathers to give them, and thou shalt
[32:06] cause them to inherit it. And the Lord,
[32:09] he it is that doth go before thee, he
[32:12] will be with thee. He will not fail
[32:14] thee, neither forsake thee. Fear not,
[32:16] neither be dismayed. Now, if he keeps
[32:19] saying, "Fear not, and be not dismayed,"
[32:23] it it's pretty clear that there's going
[32:26] to be some things to try to make him
[32:27] afraid,
[32:28] and there's going to be things that
[32:30] happen that could make him be dismayed.
[32:33] Like, wow, I thought God said this, but
[32:36] I see this. Yeah.
[32:38] Amen.
[32:39] Now, this is so relevant to the day and
[32:42] hour that we live in because you're
[32:44] living right here.
[32:46] Amen. Now, watch. Let's let's keep
[32:48] going.
[32:52] Verse nine. And Moses wrote this law and
[32:55] delivered it unto the priests, the sons
[32:57] of Levi, which bear the ark of the
[32:59] covenant of the Lord, and unto all the
[33:01] elders of Israel. And Moses commanded
[33:03] them, saying, "At the end of every seven
[33:06] years," this is an important verse,
[33:09] "nomnity of the year of release in the
[33:13] feast of tabernacles." Now, that is,
[33:15] boy, there's so much in that 10th verse.
[33:17] The the feast of tabernacles is the very
[33:20] time that Nehemiah was sent back, amen,
[33:24] to establish the wall. And Zerubabel had
[33:29] went with Joshua the high priest, then
[33:31] followed that by Ezra. It was all about
[33:33] Israel being restored as a nation after
[33:35] 7 years of captivity. And Nehemiah goes
[33:38] right back at the time of the feast of
[33:40] tabernacles. Now, friends, now you're
[33:41] coming up on rapture. Now, you're coming
[33:44] up on body change. Now, you're coming up
[33:45] on a millennium.
[33:46] Amen.
[33:47] All right. So, watch. Don't don't miss
[33:49] how this is all coming together. We
[33:51] won't get to it all today. So, don't
[33:53] worry. We're not going to blow too many
[33:55] fuses. All right. Verse 10.
[33:59] Uh verse 11. When all Israel is come to
[34:02] appear before the Lord thy God in the
[34:04] place which he shall choose, thou shalt
[34:08] read this law before all Israel in their
[34:10] hearing. And you're going to find that
[34:12] happening in the book of Nehemiah, the
[34:14] 8th chapter. Gather the people together.
[34:17] It happened before that, but I'm talking
[34:18] about after the after the restoration.
[34:20] Gather the people together, men and
[34:22] women and children, and thy stranger
[34:24] that is within thy gates, that they may
[34:26] hear, and that they may learn, and fear
[34:30] the Lord your God, and observe to do all
[34:32] the words of this law, and that their
[34:35] children which have not known anything,
[34:37] may hear, and learn to fear the Lord
[34:40] your God, as long as you live in the
[34:42] land whether you go over Jordan to
[34:45] possess it." Verse 14.
[34:49] And the Lord said unto Moses, "Behold,
[34:51] thy days approach that thou must die."
[34:54] Now, this is very important. Watch this
[34:56] detail.
[34:58] Call Joshua and present yourselves in
[35:02] the tabernacle of the congregation that
[35:05] I may give him a charge. And Moses and
[35:09] Joshua went and presented themselves in
[35:12] the tabernacle of the congregation. And
[35:15] the Lord appeared. Look who showed up.
[35:18] And the Lord appeared in the tabernacle
[35:21] in a pillar of a cloud. And the pillar
[35:24] of the cloud stood over the door of the
[35:26] tabernacle. My my my. And the Lord said
[35:29] unto Moses, "Behold, thou shalt sleep
[35:32] with thy fathers, and this people will
[35:34] rise up, and go a whoring after the gods
[35:36] of strangers of the land, whether they
[35:39] go to be among them, and will forsake
[35:41] me, and break my covenant, which I have
[35:44] made with them." Then my anger shall be
[35:46] kindled against them in that day and I
[35:48] will forsake them. We Israel was
[35:50] literally eventually carried away into
[35:52] captivity and I will hide my face from
[35:55] them and they shall be devoured and many
[35:58] evils and troubles shall befall them so
[36:00] that they will say in that day are not
[36:02] these evils come upon us because our God
[36:05] is not among us and I will surely hide
[36:08] my face in that day for all the evils
[36:10] which they have wrought in that they
[36:13] turned unto other gods. Now therefore
[36:16] write ye this song for you and teach it
[36:19] to the children of Israel. Put it in
[36:20] their mouths that they that this song
[36:22] may be a witness for me against the
[36:24] children of Israel. For when I shall
[36:27] have brought them into the land which I
[36:28] swear unto their fathers that flowth
[36:30] with milk and honey, and they shall have
[36:32] eaten and filled themselves in wax and
[36:34] fat, then will they turn unto other gods
[36:37] and serve them and provoke me and break
[36:40] my covenant. And it shall come to pass
[36:42] when many evils and troubles are
[36:44] befallen them, that this song shall
[36:46] testify against them as a witness. For
[36:48] it it shall not be forgotten out of the
[36:51] mouths of their seed. For I know their
[36:54] imagination which they go about even now
[36:56] before I have brought them into the land
[36:58] which I swear. Moses therefore wrote
[37:01] this song the same day and taught it the
[37:04] children of Israel. Can you imagine me
[37:07] coming out here this morning to say,
[37:09] "I'm going to teach you all a new song."
[37:10] And the song goes something like this.
[37:13] You're all a bunch of sinners and you're
[37:16] going to reject God and he's going to
[37:19] wipe you out.
[37:23] Everybody ready?
[37:25] All together now.
[37:30] Verse
[37:31] 23. And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a
[37:34] charge and said, "Be strong and of a
[37:37] good courage, for thou shalt bring the
[37:40] children of Israel into the land which I
[37:42] swear unto them, and I will be with
[37:44] thee." And it came to pass when Moses
[37:46] had made an end of writing the words of
[37:49] this law in a book until they were
[37:51] finished, that Moses commanded the
[37:53] Levites, which bear the ark of the
[37:55] covenant of the Lord, saying, Take this
[37:57] book of the law, and put it in the sight
[37:59] of the ark of the covenant of the Lord
[38:01] your God, that it may be therefore
[38:02] witness against thee. For I know thy
[38:05] rebellion and thy stiff neck. Behold, I
[38:07] while I am yet alive with you this day,
[38:10] ye have been rebellious against the
[38:12] Lord, and how much more after my death,
[38:14] gather me, gather unto me all the elders
[38:17] of your tribes, and your officers, that
[38:19] I may speak these words in their ears,
[38:21] and call heaven and earth to record
[38:23] against them. For I know that after my
[38:26] death, you will utterly corrupt
[38:27] yourselves, and turn aside from the way
[38:30] which I have commanded you, and evil
[38:32] will befall you in the latter days,
[38:34] because you will do evil in the sight of
[38:36] the Lord to provoke him to anger through
[38:38] the work of your hands. And Moses spake
[38:41] in the ears of all the congregation of
[38:44] Israel the words of this song until they
[38:47] were ended. Wow, what a reading. Let's
[38:52] pray. Father, we commit ourselves into
[38:54] your hands now completely. I pray Lord
[38:58] that you take the speaker and the
[38:59] hearer. Lord, let there be an anointing
[39:02] for your word that we may hear and
[39:04] receive and understand. Lord, we we read
[39:08] these ominous verses as Paul taught us
[39:12] as for our examples so that we don't
[39:16] follow this so that we don't have these
[39:19] words be true about us. They're written
[39:22] for our admonition so that we know how
[39:25] to avoid, Lord, being displeasing to
[39:28] you. And we know how to be pleasing to
[39:32] you. So that all the promises of God may
[39:36] come to pass to us as you have spoken
[39:39] for this hour and this bride in this
[39:41] day, at this moment, in this junction of
[39:44] time. Lord, I pray that you will be our
[39:46] helper today. We commit it to you. I
[39:49] know I have the mind of Christ today. I
[39:51] know I do. I can feel the anointing
[39:53] trying to surge forward. Help me now,
[39:55] Lord. I commit it to you in Jesus name.
[39:58] Amen. God bless you. You can be seated.
[40:22] There's so much here and
[40:26] I I don't want to I am going to take
[40:29] some time and lay this foundation. Um
[40:34] but I I just want to kind of make some
[40:37] opening comments. All right. So as we
[40:41] said that this book of Deuteronomy is a
[40:44] transition book and you know it it it
[40:48] begins to um kind of summarize
[40:53] everything to prove that God's word has
[40:56] been true. I love that God does that.
[40:59] You know he had made a lot of promises
[41:01] in the book of Genesis. He had laid a
[41:03] lot of types and a lot of allegorories
[41:05] and a lot of shadow in the book of
[41:07] Genesis. And that's why we find that
[41:10] there's nothing uh in the gospel that
[41:13] can't be taken back to the book of
[41:14] Genesis. In fact, I would say that if
[41:17] you can't figure out how to connect
[41:19] that, then your understanding of the
[41:21] gospel is going to be hindered because
[41:24] it is in it is in there from the very
[41:26] first from the very first chapter how
[41:30] that God would come along and talk about
[41:33] redemption even before there was anybody
[41:36] who even understood there would be a
[41:38] fall. And we find that you can go to the
[41:41] very first chapter and if you go I think
[41:43] to verse 27 and 28 just off the top of
[41:46] my head you'll find where God is saying
[41:48] to them you know be fruitful and
[41:51] multiply and replenish the earth and
[41:53] brother Brandham goes into in the spoken
[41:56] word is original seed series I believe
[41:58] that's where it's at if memory serves
[42:00] and he starts talking about how that you
[42:02] know that as soon as as soon as God you
[42:06] know starts talking about you
[42:10] multiply and replenish the earth.
[42:13] Brother Brandham said, "Of course,
[42:15] there's no way to multiply unless
[42:18] there's death."
[42:19] Right?
[42:20] So, the seed has to die and then it
[42:22] multiplies.
[42:23] So, you can see reading between the
[42:26] lines, connecting the dots, that in
[42:29] Genesis 1:27 and 28, before the fall,
[42:33] Yeah. Before Adam even understands a
[42:36] redeemer or a healer
[42:38] or a savior or protector, before any of
[42:41] that is even uh unfolded, God is already
[42:46] laying inside the scripture redemption.
[42:48] Amen.
[42:49] That there's no way that there's ever
[42:51] going to be a replenishing. There's not
[42:53] going to be a redemption. There's not
[42:56] going to be a replenishing unless
[42:58] there's a multiplying. And there's not
[43:00] going to be a multiplying unless
[43:01] something dies. So when when we begin to
[43:05] look that all of these various promises
[43:07] and we could spend our whole morning
[43:09] just in Genesis and the allegorical
[43:11] types and shadows showing what we have
[43:14] today. You see all of the seven seals
[43:16] there including now we see the seventh
[43:18] seal. We didn't before. We never could
[43:20] see it. We couldn't see any of them. Uh
[43:22] but uh but once they became open then we
[43:25] could tie it back because remember
[43:28] everything has to dovetail
[43:30] from Genesis to Revelation
[43:33] or you'll have your cow your picture
[43:37] will be a cow standing in the top of a
[43:39] tree eating grass.
[43:41] I like to improve it says drinking a
[43:43] Coca-Cola.
[43:45] So your picture will be all goofed up if
[43:48] you don't have it all doveetailed all
[43:50] together. We have uh uh brother Lee
[43:53] Frasier here with us. Brother Jack,
[43:55] we're going to baptize him today.
[43:56] Brother Jack's been playing evangelist
[43:58] out on the field like like in Pilgrim's
[44:00] Progress. My just when Pilgrim needed
[44:02] him, here come evangelist. Oh my. And so
[44:06] uh began to witness to him and like
[44:07] Aquilla and Priscilla took him took him
[44:10] and opened the word and began to expound
[44:12] to him like they did to Apollos. Begin
[44:14] to expound him more perfectly. And so
[44:16] the brother has already begun to see the
[44:19] the the fundamentals of the early church
[44:21] that they were all baptized in the name
[44:23] of the Lord. No one was ever baptized in
[44:25] those titles. So he's here today to be
[44:27] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[44:29] Christ.
[44:30] And he said to me in the office back
[44:31] there, he said, "Today is day one."
[44:34] He said, "Now I want to know more and I
[44:36] want to go forward. I want to know
[44:37] more." Oh, brother, there's a lot more
[44:39] to understand. Praise the Lord.
[44:42] Hallelujah. and how that you know he he
[44:44] had a background uh in the Christian
[44:47] church and you know great great family
[44:50] members and sincere ministers not their
[44:52] fault it's just that this was the time
[44:55] and this was the season and God revealed
[44:57] himself
[44:58] and so we realize that that's how God
[45:00] has done it all down through the ages
[45:02] friends there's not one of us can get in
[45:05] on our own merits if it's not for the
[45:07] mercy of God revealing himself to us
[45:11] not just somewhere back in the where he
[45:13] finally revealed himself to me. No,
[45:15] every day, every day as I go forward, I
[45:18] need a fresh revelation. I need a fresh
[45:21] unfolding because I got to know how to
[45:23] live in this day in order to take a body
[45:26] change.
[45:27] And it's going to require, we speak a
[45:29] lot about the third pull. And there's a
[45:31] lot that'll seem, uh, strange to you
[45:33] today, uh, brother Lee. So, just bear
[45:35] bear with us. You don't have to learn it
[45:36] all in one day. But but we find that you
[45:40] know there there's great promises to us
[45:42] under the third pull and under the
[45:44] spoken word. And I have just, you know,
[45:47] had my whole mind almost open to a whole
[45:50] new level of of um understanding is the
[45:54] wrong word of of where you know how
[45:56] something you can you can look at for a
[45:59] long time and and you understand it and
[46:02] you know it, but then you read it or you
[46:05] hear it and something occurs to you
[46:07] within it. You go, "Wow, I that never
[46:10] occurred to me before." Amen.
[46:13] And so that that's just been amazing to
[46:15] me as we started Wednesday night and I I
[46:18] it was such a blessing to me taking that
[46:21] that experience that brother Brandham
[46:23] had there, you know, with the with the
[46:25] bear and the caribou. And I hope hope
[46:27] that was a blessing to you. I believe it
[46:29] was. And and just begin to correlate
[46:31] that to say here's how it can affect our
[46:33] lives. and and I I found myself of no
[46:36] intention, but I found myself where
[46:39] where brother Brandham is back in in
[46:41] another experience and he's in the woods
[46:43] with squirrels and and and it it it it
[46:46] caught me in a way that I had never
[46:48] occurred to me before. You know, that
[46:51] when he began to speak those things,
[46:53] sometimes he would speak it and there it
[46:56] was and it was easy. And then he goes on
[46:58] in the story and by the time he gets to
[47:01] the second squirrel, there's already a
[47:03] confusion. And he shoots one. He goes,
[47:06] "There's my there's my third one." And
[47:08] he goes along and that ends up that's
[47:10] the second one. And then that must have
[47:11] been a fourth one. When where's the
[47:13] third one? And and he's he's in the
[47:15] woods and it's getting dark and he
[47:16] doesn't even understand. And he he's
[47:18] trying to reason it out in his mind. Oh,
[47:21] well, it must have been that uh I got
[47:23] three cuz that's what I said. And then
[47:25] he told me to call it and then I did. I
[47:27] was going to go home. He told me to go
[47:28] back. You said you needed three. Okay.
[47:30] Well, two's enough. No, you said three.
[47:33] You've already said it.
[47:35] You've already spoken creative words.
[47:37] That can't be reversed.
[47:40] God already spoke a creative word about
[47:42] you and that can't be reversed.
[47:45] Hallelujah. You should thank God for
[47:46] that. He's already seen me. He's already
[47:48] identified me. I'm already in a book and
[47:50] that can't be reversed. Not by the
[47:53] devil, not by your neighbor, not by me,
[47:55] not by you.
[47:58] Amen.
[48:00] There's a section there in that lamb's
[48:02] book of life of names that can under no
[48:04] circumstances
[48:06] be deleted.
[48:09] And so we, you know, he he's just in
[48:12] this terrible quandry. And I don't want
[48:13] to get ahead of myself. I may come back
[48:15] to that before I run out of time today.
[48:17] And I won't uh weary you. Don't worry
[48:19] because I already know we can't get it
[48:21] all.
[48:23] But when we when we come to this book of
[48:26] Deuteronomy, this transitional book,
[48:28] this is the time where, you know, so
[48:31] much is going to happen and they're
[48:34] going to summarize and Moses is going to
[48:37] go back and remind them of what happened
[48:40] in Exodus. And the Exodus was because of
[48:45] Genesis. Because it was in Genesis God
[48:48] said to Abraham, "Your seed will sojourn
[48:51] in a land for four generations, 400
[48:55] years." And you know, anybody who's
[48:59] going to, you know, uh, fall apart over
[49:04] things we don't understand and things
[49:07] that might look like in the human mind
[49:09] that, you know, I mean, if I look at
[49:11] what what Moses writes that they're
[49:15] going to be there for 400 years
[49:18] and then Abraham is a witness to that
[49:22] and then according to Moses, it came
[49:25] from God.
[49:26] Amen.
[49:27] To Abraham and and Moses caught it by
[49:29] vision and wrote it down. And then
[49:32] hundreds of years later, Paul records
[49:35] that, well, it actually took 430 years.
[49:37] So now, is Paul wrong? Is Moses wrong?
[49:41] Was Abraham wrong? Or was God wrong?
[49:46] Human reasoning would say, "Nah,
[49:47] somebody's we got a false prophet in
[49:49] here somewhere."
[49:50] Or God doesn't keep his word exactly
[49:52] like he said. And none of that's true.
[49:54] Right? God always keeps his word exactly
[49:57] like he promised, but it might not come
[49:59] exactly like you expected or understand
[50:01] it to come.
[50:03] See, and so this this is what's
[50:06] happening in Deuteronomy. I mean, Moses,
[50:09] his whole life is to lead the children
[50:12] of Israel to the promised land. And now
[50:14] he don't even get to go in.
[50:16] Amen.
[50:17] The whole premise,
[50:19] the whole foundation of coming out of
[50:21] Egypt was so he could take him into the
[50:23] promised land. But events happened that
[50:26] God knew about.
[50:28] Was all perfect. God already knew it
[50:30] wasn't going to be Moses. God already
[50:32] knew it was going to be Joshua.
[50:35] See?
[50:36] And so, you know, we thought a prophet
[50:38] would take us into the rapture. From
[50:40] this day, he didn't. But we found out
[50:41] that it was Joshua. But then we found
[50:44] out that contrary to kingdom builders
[50:46] who wanted to claim that moniker, it was
[50:48] never going to be another man.
[50:50] It was going to be the Holy Ghost.
[50:53] Amen. Amen.
[50:54] It is it is preposterous
[50:57] for any other man to rise up and say he
[50:59] has the Joshua commission when that's
[51:01] the very thing that came to William
[51:03] Brandom. He said, "Open your Bible." And
[51:05] when he opened his Bible, it falls to
[51:06] Joshua 1.
[51:08] And he that went for years because that
[51:10] commission was doubled down into that
[51:12] one ministry. Here you had Moses and
[51:14] Joshua
[51:16] just like you had John and you had
[51:17] Jesus.
[51:19] But but we see that the end time under
[51:21] the prophecy of the son of man and
[51:22] brother Brandham talks about this on
[51:24] tape how that now it come down it's not
[51:26] in two different people it's in one body
[51:29] it's in one messenger
[51:31] that because it's got to be
[51:32] reestablished because it was one
[51:33] messenger in the alpha church the
[51:35] apostle Paul
[51:37] and everybody else had to acquies to
[51:38] Paul's teaching even though it was
[51:40] strange and hard to be understood
[51:44] see
[51:46] his revelation was so great that It
[51:48] trumped the personal side byside
[51:50] experiences of the other apostles.
[51:53] Amen.
[51:54] It didn't matter that they hunted with
[51:56] him and fished with him
[51:58] and ate with him and slept alongside
[52:00] him.
[52:01] It didn't matter that they sat and heard
[52:03] him in person. Paul's revelation
[52:05] surpassed all of that.
[52:07] See, and and so Paul's ministry became,
[52:12] we talk about that we have the we're the
[52:14] final voice to the final age. There's a
[52:15] reason for that. That's not poetic
[52:17] license. That's not prophet just
[52:18] thinking something to say nice
[52:20] right
[52:21] that's a that's speaks of a reality of
[52:24] the restored word we are the final voice
[52:27] to the final age because we have the
[52:29] final word to all the ages
[52:31] that Paul established and no other can
[52:33] be established and no other foundation
[52:35] could be laid
[52:36] and and even if even an angel would come
[52:38] and try to change it or even if I would
[52:41] nobody could count could countermand
[52:44] Paul's words
[52:45] see and God certainly couldn't
[52:48] countermand them cuz he gave them
[52:50] and God does not change his mind about
[52:53] his word ever.
[52:56] People imagine God is telling them and
[52:58] giving them permission to do this or do
[53:00] that. Oh well, you know, I can do it
[53:02] because God let me. I'm special person.
[53:04] I'm not denying you're a special person.
[53:06] I'm not denying God might love you, but
[53:09] he never makes an exception for anybody
[53:11] when it comes to his word. Amen.
[53:14] You have to keep it or you perish.
[53:19] I think that the one who created
[53:20] everything probably has that right.
[53:24] It was all created by him and for him.
[53:26] Amen.
[53:26] See, and so, you know, you you had you
[53:30] had them coming to where now Deuteronomy
[53:34] is a summation and it's a transition
[53:35] because now it's going to figure out
[53:38] everything that happened in Genesis and
[53:39] give explanation to it. is going to go
[53:41] through Leviticus and they're they're
[53:43] going to understand the similarities
[53:46] of the priesthood that Christ would be
[53:48] in because Moses and Jesus had such
[53:52] identical ministries.
[53:53] Amen.
[53:54] They were both intercessors. They were
[53:56] both prophets. They were both God to the
[53:57] people.
[54:00] Amen.
[54:01] They were both human men.
[54:03] See, one one was a regular man, one was
[54:06] a God man.
[54:08] You understand? Yeah.
[54:10] And so, so we find out then that that
[54:12] the word of God would come into Moses
[54:14] and the Bible calls him God to the
[54:16] people. But as soon as he would give out
[54:18] his word, then he would go back to being
[54:20] Moses again. They'd have to veil his
[54:22] face when the word came in him. And as
[54:25] soon as he spoke it out of him, the word
[54:27] went out of him, then they could unveil
[54:28] his face. That's not a metaphor. That's
[54:30] real. That's history.
[54:32] See? And so, so we find that's why John
[54:35] is told in the water, you're going to
[54:38] see something unprecedented.
[54:40] Really? What is it? Something that's
[54:42] never happened. Okay, what am I looking
[54:44] for? You're going to see the spirit of
[54:46] God descend upon a man.
[54:48] Lord, we we've seen that for 4,000
[54:51] years. Yeah, but in this case, it won't
[54:54] leave him.
[54:55] It'll come upon him and remain.
[54:58] Wow. That's new. Exactly. that's going
[55:01] to be the son of God. That's how you'll
[55:03] know. So John was going to see a sign.
[55:07] You know, the the world didn't receive
[55:09] Jesus because he was a sign they had
[55:11] never seen. And it took a prophet to
[55:14] say, "I don't care what you think or
[55:16] what you saw or didn't see. I saw it.
[55:19] I saw the spirit of God descend and come
[55:21] upon him. And I'm declaring unto you,
[55:23] this is the lamb of God.
[55:26] You can believe it or perish."
[55:28] See, and so think about it today,
[55:31] friends. Think about when a prophet
[55:33] would stand before the denominational
[55:37] world who were filled with good people.
[55:40] Yeah.
[55:41] Who were the the the the the
[55:46] generations the p the the the
[55:48] generations like the children and
[55:50] grandchildren and and multiple
[55:51] generations of great movements that
[55:53] started down through the ages. great
[55:56] movements by great men.
[55:58] But the problem was they they had a
[56:00] stopping point. Now, their stopping
[56:02] point was the limits of their
[56:04] revelation.
[56:05] So, they they don't go to hell for that.
[56:08] You understand? You can't disbelieve
[56:10] what you don't know. And since unbelief
[56:11] is the real sin anyway.
[56:13] You you can't be accused of unbelief.
[56:16] You can't disbelieve what you don't
[56:17] know. So, they reached a stopping point.
[56:20] That wasn't the problem because God had
[56:22] all had already promised. Don't worry, I
[56:25] got several stars left in my hand and
[56:27] I'll hurl them down. I'll get I'll hurl
[56:28] them down in my time. Just carry on.
[56:31] Just be humble Christian. Just be a
[56:32] believer. I got this. I got a plan for
[56:35] it. Just keep walking in the light as he
[56:37] is in the light. And the problem was a
[56:39] group rose up who said, "No, we're going
[56:41] to put a period right here." Which meant
[56:43] nothing more can come. And that was the
[56:46] problem.
[56:47] Then it became a man-made system that
[56:50] God never ordained.
[56:53] See?
[56:54] Amen.
[56:54] And so, so that's exactly where we are
[56:58] today. You had a prophet coming and he
[57:01] was just like John in the order of John.
[57:04] He could say he could say those
[57:07] denominational systems. He's not talking
[57:09] about the great people that were in
[57:11] them. He's not talking about the great
[57:13] people that started them. He's talking
[57:15] about the structure.
[57:17] That structure will if you don't get out
[57:20] of it, just like Moses had to have a
[57:22] message come out of Egypt, this day
[57:24] prophet had to have a message come out
[57:26] of denominations. Why? Because that
[57:28] system will lead you to the mark of the
[57:30] beast.
[57:32] And so the message was the midnight hour
[57:35] is here. Behold, the bridegroom cometh.
[57:38] Go ye out
[57:41] to meet him.
[57:43] Come out of her, my people.
[57:46] See, that you be not a partaker of her
[57:49] sin. What was her sin? Unbelief in the
[57:51] in the continuation of the revealed
[57:53] word.
[57:56] So that people who had entrenched
[57:58] themselves
[57:59] uh in in Luther's teaching could not
[58:02] accept the message of Wesley
[58:04] and therefore it's now sin
[58:07] because the word has come and now
[58:08] there's no more excuse. Just like when
[58:10] the gospel came to the Jews. And Paul
[58:14] says, "Listen, there was a time
[58:18] when God winked at your ignorance."
[58:21] Why? Because you couldn't believe what
[58:22] you didn't know.
[58:24] Amen.
[58:24] He winked at your ignorance.
[58:26] But now, now that Christ has come, now
[58:30] that the word's been fulfilled, and not
[58:32] only that, now the Holy Ghost has come.
[58:35] Amen. And now he and and and he there
[58:38] was a time when he winked at your
[58:40] ignorance, but now
[58:41] he requires all men to repent.
[58:45] See, and that's was Peter's message.
[58:47] Because he w Peter wasn't on the day of
[58:49] Pentecost, as you've heard me teach
[58:51] before. Peter was not preaching on the
[58:56] day of Pentecost. He was not out there
[58:57] preaching to hoodils,
[59:00] drunkards, horongers.
[59:02] So when he says, well, he said, "What
[59:04] must we He says repent. He's not talking
[59:07] about get out of the barrooms and quit
[59:08] committing adultery. These were devout
[59:11] Jews.
[59:12] Amen.
[59:13] See, but the pro so so it wasn't about
[59:17] our our our wins and losses column. How
[59:19] how holy and righteous we are. It's that
[59:21] the word has come forward and now if you
[59:24] want to follow receive life, you're
[59:26] going to have to follow the light and
[59:28] you're going to have to repent of your
[59:29] thinking that that that the law of Moses
[59:32] is all you needed. It's not the the the
[59:35] law. Besides that, the law of Moses
[59:38] wasn't si. That was what the people did.
[59:41] That was the choice they made.
[59:43] Brother Brand said it was not God's
[59:45] doing that. They wanted a part in it.
[59:47] God gave them a law to prove to them
[59:48] they couldn't keep it. It ended up
[59:50] destroying them.
[59:52] But the law of Moses was the Lord your
[59:55] God shall raise up a prophet like me,
[59:58] and whoever won't hear him will be will
[1:00:00] perish.
[1:00:02] And so now Paul is saying that law of
[1:00:05] Moses, you claim to follow Moses. He
[1:00:07] told you a prophet was coming. He's
[1:00:09] come. He died. He was buried. He rose.
[1:00:12] He ascended. He sent the spirit back in
[1:00:14] the church. And now you got to move on
[1:00:16] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:23] So you have
[1:00:26] brother Brandham coming.
[1:00:28] You have Moses coming.
[1:00:31] who was the prophet who led the people
[1:00:33] out of denominationalism/Egypt.
[1:00:37] And then you you find that he's going to
[1:00:40] go off the scene and Joshua is going to
[1:00:43] lead him over and there's got to be a
[1:00:44] commission. And so he says
[1:00:47] the time Moses has come that you got to
[1:00:50] leave the scene.
[1:00:53] You're going to have to die. And God's
[1:00:55] going to end up burying him in a secret
[1:00:57] burial. He's no one's invited.
[1:01:00] And no one no one knew would know the
[1:01:03] secret would be Moses was that
[1:01:05] important. He was so special. God
[1:01:09] wouldn't it was just a personal funeral
[1:01:11] with God and Moses who took his body and
[1:01:13] buried it in a place wouldn't even allow
[1:01:15] angels or the devil or people or anybody
[1:01:17] to see where he buried him.
[1:01:20] And when we find Jesus on Mount
[1:01:22] Transfiguration, Brother Ram shows
[1:01:25] somewhere between his death in
[1:01:27] Deuteronomy
[1:01:28] and Mount Transfiguration, he got raised
[1:01:31] from the dead because because the three
[1:01:34] disciples, Peter, James, and John saw
[1:01:37] him
[1:01:37] alive
[1:01:39] on the Mount Transfiguration. See?
[1:01:42] And so, so, so we realize and he they
[1:01:44] didn't see an old man.
[1:01:47] No, no, no, no, no. Brother Brandham
[1:01:48] makes that very clear. It's not an old
[1:01:50] man they saw. Oh, we saw pictures and
[1:01:52] carvings of Moses that we know that's
[1:01:54] him. But when they got into that
[1:01:56] anointing, Brother Brandham said their
[1:01:58] eyes were opened. Just like on the road
[1:02:01] to Emmas, they didn't know who Jesus was
[1:02:03] until their eyes were open. I'm here to
[1:02:05] tell you, you can't get you don't get to
[1:02:07] blow a trumpet and pat yourself on the
[1:02:09] back because you see the word in this
[1:02:11] hour. Your eyes have been open.
[1:02:16] Amen. We You owe everything to the Lord.
[1:02:19] You owe everything to the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:22] Amen.
[1:02:24] The time that you must depart, call for
[1:02:26] Joshua. And notice the symbology. They
[1:02:29] So now Moses and Joshua present
[1:02:31] themselves together in the tabernacle
[1:02:34] congregation before the people. And then
[1:02:36] guess who shows up? A pillar of fire.
[1:02:39] See? So now you've got two separate
[1:02:43] people and a pillar of fire. But now
[1:02:47] coming in the day that you and I live
[1:02:49] in, it's housed in one prophet.
[1:02:52] And you find that who shows up every
[1:02:55] service? A pillar of fire.
[1:02:57] Where did he show up? At the tabernacle
[1:03:00] of congregation. Where above the door.
[1:03:02] Who was the door? In the tabernacle,
[1:03:04] Christ.
[1:03:05] Hallelujah. So, just like John could
[1:03:08] say, you might not see the pillar of
[1:03:10] fire, but I've seen it. And I'm a
[1:03:12] vindicated prophet, and I'm here to tell
[1:03:13] you this is the Christ. And a prophet in
[1:03:16] our day who everybody didn't see the
[1:03:18] pillar fire, but he would say, "He's
[1:03:20] here."
[1:03:21] What are you declaring? Your
[1:03:22] denominations are a death trap. Well,
[1:03:24] where's the where's Christ? Right here.
[1:03:27] And that same prophet said, "I see the
[1:03:30] pillar of fire to do what?" To confirm
[1:03:32] the location of Christ in the word.
[1:03:36] Amen.
[1:03:37] So that now he can come inside of a
[1:03:39] bride.
[1:03:40] Yeah.
[1:03:41] Amen.
[1:03:42] You with me?
[1:03:43] Yeah.
[1:03:44] Okay. If I see you blinking, I'm going
[1:03:47] to know I'm going too fast.
[1:03:50] So, I'm just trying to encapsulate
[1:03:52] everything and we're going to go just a
[1:03:53] little bit further. You still good?
[1:03:56] I want to get my foundation and my theme
[1:04:00] very much today.
[1:04:04] So we find then that of course
[1:04:07] it goes on. I mean the pillar of fire
[1:04:10] showed up there in in chapter 31 where
[1:04:13] where we read
[1:04:16] and uh he comes down on into into
[1:04:19] chapter 32 and you know verse 7 follow
[1:04:23] with me brother Mark chapter 32 of
[1:04:25] Deuteronomy verse 7. Remember the days
[1:04:27] of old. Consider the years of many
[1:04:30] generations. Ask thy father and he will
[1:04:32] show thee thy elders and they will tell
[1:04:34] thee. When the most high divided the
[1:04:36] nations uh to the nations their
[1:04:38] inheritance when he separated the sons
[1:04:40] of Adam and set bounds of the people
[1:04:43] according to the number of the children
[1:04:44] of Israel. So God's been working by
[1:04:47] election. That's not a new concept. Goes
[1:04:50] on down verse 11. Now catch it. Look at
[1:04:52] verse look at verse 11. As an eagle
[1:04:55] stirth up her nest, flutterth over her
[1:04:57] young, spreadth abroad her wings, taketh
[1:04:58] them, beareth them on her wings. So the
[1:05:00] Lord did lead them and and there was no
[1:05:03] strange God with him. Now this is the
[1:05:06] very one of the very first and one of
[1:05:09] the I know it was very early in brother
[1:05:11] Brandon's ministry, but one of the most
[1:05:13] poignant sermons he would ever preach,
[1:05:15] as the eagle stirth her nest.
[1:05:18] Th this is the very sermon that has
[1:05:21] caused so many of God's eagles to
[1:05:23] realize I'm confined in a barnyard.
[1:05:28] And and I there's something in my nature
[1:05:30] that says this man-made system ain't
[1:05:33] ain't for me.
[1:05:35] You couldn't do that to yourself. God
[1:05:37] doesn't that
[1:05:39] you heard an eagle scream as the eagle
[1:05:41] stirth her that flatterth over her
[1:05:42] young. And you heard a scream and what
[1:05:44] what was your immediate desire to fly
[1:05:47] higher? to soar into the heavenlies. Oh,
[1:05:50] don't let the world take you away. You
[1:05:53] you young people, don't let the world
[1:05:55] entice you away because that's all
[1:05:57] nothing but destruction. You're you're
[1:05:59] walking around in bondage. Say, "Oh, I
[1:06:02] want to be free." That's not freedom.
[1:06:04] That's death. The only freedom is in the
[1:06:06] heavenlies.
[1:06:08] So, you commit your lives to him now
[1:06:10] while you're young, and you'll soar into
[1:06:12] the heavenlies. Yeah.
[1:06:16] Verse 15. But Joshua and waxed fat. It's
[1:06:18] another word for Jerusalem. Kicked. Thou
[1:06:21] art waxing fat. Thou art grown thick.
[1:06:24] Thou art covered with fatness. Then he
[1:06:26] forsook God which made him and lightly
[1:06:28] esteemed the rock of his salvation.
[1:06:31] Now, I I want to
[1:06:34] connect a dot, just one,
[1:06:37] that I'm not going to get to today, but
[1:06:39] I want to put it in your mind because
[1:06:41] when Brother Brandham is telling about
[1:06:44] the squirrels, now this is unique
[1:06:48] because this is this is not just saying,
[1:06:51] "I saw an animal that I shot at a
[1:06:54] distance with one bullet and this is
[1:06:55] what happened and there's a checkered
[1:06:57] shirt on a young guy." See, that's just
[1:07:00] seeing the future.
[1:07:02] But now this is creating the future
[1:07:05] where he says because brother Benam has
[1:07:07] it on his mind. If you say to this
[1:07:09] mountain,
[1:07:10] you understand now where the word is
[1:07:12] trying to take us to.
[1:07:15] See, it's trying to bring a union. I'm
[1:07:17] going to I'm going to read a statement.
[1:07:19] If I if I if I don't run out of time, I
[1:07:21] may I may not. We'll see. But but we
[1:07:24] find that that when he comes to the end
[1:07:28] of this wow is it ever a convoluted
[1:07:31] story. I mean brother Brandham is just
[1:07:34] he it's if you go to the tape and hear
[1:07:37] it as I was with Moses
[1:07:39] and he's telling this story
[1:07:42] you're you're just going to almost have
[1:07:44] a you're talking about anxiety. I'm
[1:07:46] listening to it and I'm got anxiety and
[1:07:48] I already know the outcome.
[1:07:50] And I'm like oh my goodness. And then he
[1:07:52] starts again with something else. And
[1:07:53] then it must be this. And no, it's not.
[1:07:54] But maybe it's this. No, it's not that
[1:07:56] either. Well, what is it then? It's over
[1:07:57] here. Oh, I didn't see it. Well, that's
[1:07:58] because this had to go with this to go
[1:08:00] with that. Oh, now I get it. No, you
[1:08:02] don't
[1:08:03] because there's still another part. You
[1:08:04] still don't get it all. And a prophet
[1:08:06] literally had to go and go and go and go
[1:08:09] and it it began to listen friends, you
[1:08:12] we talk about a third pull. We talk
[1:08:13] about how he right. And there he was
[1:08:16] said, "Ask anything." You know, when I
[1:08:19] read the story that he tells leading up
[1:08:24] to that
[1:08:25] and he ties it back to Genesis where
[1:08:27] Abraham needed a ram,
[1:08:29] needed a sacrifice, said that's the only
[1:08:31] place I can think to tie it to is where
[1:08:34] Abraham needed something he couldn't
[1:08:35] produce himself.
[1:08:38] But God by his spoken word all but what
[1:08:41] was Abraham what was Abraham's duty?
[1:08:44] Obey.
[1:08:46] obey. And that's why when brother Benham
[1:08:49] comes to the very end of this amazing
[1:08:51] story and he he he said now the you can
[1:08:55] tell the audience that he's preaching to
[1:08:58] my they're they're ready to just go
[1:09:01] empty the hospitals
[1:09:02] and the graveyards and they're ready to
[1:09:05] just run out the door and start speaking
[1:09:06] the word.
[1:09:09] And and and it sounds almost like a
[1:09:11] prophet is saying that, hey, we've
[1:09:12] reached a time now. We're just going to
[1:09:14] go all go out here and decide and we're
[1:09:15] just going to speak. I'm glad God didn't
[1:09:17] give me or you that.
[1:09:19] Oh, you'd kill every every enemy you
[1:09:21] have.
[1:09:22] You'd wreck their lives. You'd set your
[1:09:24] own self up for good and it would end up
[1:09:26] being your bad.
[1:09:28] You'd get slapped down by God every time
[1:09:30] you tried to say in the name of Jesus to
[1:09:32] keep you from saying it. Listen friends,
[1:09:34] there's no virtue in you and me. And
[1:09:37] that's why brother Brandham tied it
[1:09:38] back. And he actually calmed them down
[1:09:41] by tying it back. He said, "What we
[1:09:43] need?" Tell us quickly. Oh, this this
[1:09:46] word is ready. Tell us what we need. We
[1:09:48] need consecration.
[1:09:50] Huh?
[1:09:51] Yeah. We need dedication. No, no, no.
[1:09:52] We're ready to go to the graveyard. Not
[1:09:54] yet. You're not ready to go to the
[1:09:56] graveyard. This is only going to be like
[1:09:58] Abraham. You got to have dedication. You
[1:10:00] got to have consecration. That's why it
[1:10:02] worked for Hadtie, right?
[1:10:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:10:06] This is exactly why he says just sure
[1:10:09] and waxed fat and he forsook God which
[1:10:11] made him and lightly esteemed the rock
[1:10:13] of his salvation. Th this isn't about
[1:10:16] God putting power in immature people who
[1:10:20] don't have enough of the spirit of God
[1:10:22] to dedicate their lives and their hearts
[1:10:24] and dedicate their minds and be
[1:10:25] consecrated to God.
[1:10:28] Those are the people who will do great
[1:10:29] exploits at the last day. The people who
[1:10:32] know their God,
[1:10:34] not know about him,
[1:10:36] [Applause]
[1:10:39] got a church full of people who know
[1:10:40] about him.
[1:10:41] Paul never said to Timothy, "Go preach
[1:10:43] about Christ."
[1:10:44] He said, "Preach Christ."
[1:10:47] See, and so you you find it, oh, that
[1:10:51] verse 29, brother Mark, uh, chapter 32,
[1:10:54] verse 29. Oh, that they were wise, that
[1:10:56] they understood this, that they would
[1:10:58] consider their latter end. Here was here
[1:11:02] was what was possible. How should one
[1:11:04] chase a thousand and two put 10,000 to
[1:11:07] flight except their rock had sold them
[1:11:10] and the Lord had shut them up?
[1:11:13] Oh, listen friends. You understand that
[1:11:15] this isn't this is never going to be
[1:11:18] about the bride running around. And
[1:11:21] we've we've had far too much of that. of
[1:11:24] people trying to run out and build some
[1:11:26] kingdom based on some teaching or some
[1:11:28] doctrine.
[1:11:30] And all it done was blow families apart
[1:11:32] and blow lives apart and blow young
[1:11:34] people apart before they could even get
[1:11:36] out of the gate.
[1:11:37] True.
[1:11:37] It was never supposed to be like that.
[1:11:40] That's not how it was supposed to come.
[1:11:42] This bride had a messenger and she's got
[1:11:44] a five-fold ministry to teach her the
[1:11:46] sense of it.
[1:11:48] In other words, how to apply. You see
[1:11:50] that in Gen in uh in Nehemiah 8.
[1:11:53] Uh, go there, Mark. Go to Nehemiah 8.
[1:11:56] I'm getting ahead of myself, but I I
[1:11:58] better qualify what I just said. So,
[1:12:00] when you go to Nehemiah 8 and 7 and 8,
[1:12:04] uh, Nehemiah chapter 8, verses 7 and 8.
[1:12:07] Wait for it to come up. And, and Yeshua
[1:12:09] and Bonnie and Sherbaya, Jaman, Akab,
[1:12:14] Shabbathi, had
[1:12:17] whatever that word is, and that one, and
[1:12:19] that one, and that one, and that one. 13
[1:12:20] of them. Plus all the all the priests go
[1:12:24] on to under what what did they do? They
[1:12:26] and and the Levites caused the people to
[1:12:29] understand the law and the people stood
[1:12:32] in their place. Now before we go to
[1:12:33] verse eight, the history here, this is
[1:12:36] in Nehemiah.
[1:12:39] Uh uh Zerubbable's already been there.
[1:12:42] The
[1:12:44] Ezra has already been there. The the
[1:12:47] foundation of the tabernacle has been
[1:12:48] relayed. The walls have been have been
[1:12:50] laid. The walls have been built.
[1:12:53] And we find that that now Ezra stands up
[1:12:56] to read the restored word.
[1:13:00] Cuz it had been lost. Oh my. You
[1:13:03] understand why we needed that at the end
[1:13:05] time? A word that had been lost.
[1:13:07] And there had to be one stand up
[1:13:10] qualified who had been called of God at
[1:13:12] the time of restoration.
[1:13:14] And he had to read the word of God. But
[1:13:16] then the problem was that down through
[1:13:19] the ages of their captivity, the
[1:13:22] original language of the word had been
[1:13:24] lost. And even their children didn't
[1:13:26] even understand Hebrew anymore. And even
[1:13:28] the and and all and even the adults,
[1:13:30] it's been 70 years. Most of them have
[1:13:32] forgotten their Hebrew. It's kind of
[1:13:35] sketchy. Uh Ezra remembered it because
[1:13:37] he's a scribe and that was his job to
[1:13:39] remember it. And so, but we find out
[1:13:41] that that now most of them speak
[1:13:43] Aramaic. Amen.
[1:13:45] And so now you had this great man of God
[1:13:48] taking the revealed word and bringing it
[1:13:51] out. But the people now need a five-fold
[1:13:54] Levite ministry to explain the sense of
[1:13:58] it. In other words, how to apply it
[1:14:02] in our lives. Look at verse eight. So
[1:14:05] they read in the book in the law of God
[1:14:08] distinctly and gave the sense and caused
[1:14:11] them to understand the reading.
[1:14:14] Hallelujah.
[1:14:15] See, so God never
[1:14:19] ordained
[1:14:21] for another man to rise up
[1:14:24] and take some new doctrine and now he's
[1:14:28] got a new camp and all he is is a
[1:14:30] kingdom builder.
[1:14:31] Amen.
[1:14:32] Wow. and building this kingdom or what
[1:14:34] we call camp or this camp or this
[1:14:36] kingdom or this kingdom or this kingdom
[1:14:37] or this camp and it's all just kingdoms
[1:14:39] to himself
[1:14:41] drawing all the people to himself
[1:14:42] something William and Brandham never did
[1:14:45] amen
[1:14:45] see
[1:14:46] but it but it was never given to the
[1:14:49] five-fold ministry to reinterpret the
[1:14:52] message we we did the the bride didn't
[1:14:54] need the five-fold ministry to do that
[1:14:57] it came to us in the simplest form it
[1:14:59] could a Kentucky hillbilly anybody can
[1:15:01] get it Yeah,
[1:15:02] you don't have to be a scholar. The mind
[1:15:04] of God knew that he would he would pull
[1:15:07] out all the stops and make no
[1:15:08] limitations that even the common man
[1:15:11] like Jesus could understand it plainly.
[1:15:16] See, but you can't just push play no
[1:15:18] more than Ezra could just read. There
[1:15:20] still had to be Levites to explain the
[1:15:23] sense of it. In other words, to show
[1:15:24] people how to apply it in their lives,
[1:15:26] in their homes, in their jobs, in their
[1:15:29] families, and their children. Yeah.
[1:15:32] Amen.
[1:15:33] It's not to them to reinterpret it or
[1:15:36] create something new and build a
[1:15:37] kingdom. It was never about that.
[1:15:41] Oh my.
[1:15:44] We find that
[1:15:46] was never going to be about that.
[1:15:49] When you when you think about
[1:15:53] the the the unsealing today that we have
[1:15:57] of the word of God that came to us in
[1:15:59] the opening of the seven seals and you
[1:16:02] know uh
[1:16:04] as I said we never needed you know
[1:16:07] another man other than brother Brenham
[1:16:08] to make clear the word clear at the end
[1:16:11] time.
[1:16:11] Amen. So the five-fold ministry that
[1:16:14] followed was not to establish
[1:16:17] or add to the restored gospel, not to
[1:16:21] reinterpret the teaching of the already
[1:16:24] restored gospel.
[1:16:25] That God established them to help the
[1:16:28] people know how to apply it. Amen.
[1:16:30] We were just the other day right here on
[1:16:33] the picnic table, some minister, part of
[1:16:34] the team and I and we were just talking
[1:16:36] about the various offices, apostles and
[1:16:39] prophets and pastors and teachers and
[1:16:40] evangelists going on down and and I was
[1:16:43] just showing them, you know, uh, you
[1:16:45] know, in military order how that you you
[1:16:47] in every military you've got an officer
[1:16:49] corps and then you've got you've got the
[1:16:51] main army and and and this is why so
[1:16:54] much discouragement has been in the main
[1:16:55] army over the years because the officer
[1:16:57] corps seem to can't get along. jealous
[1:17:00] over each other.
[1:17:01] Oh my goodness, I am so we are so
[1:17:03] blessed here. I can tell you we meet and
[1:17:05] we talk about these things often and God
[1:17:08] has given us such a team of men who have
[1:17:10] one heart and one mind
[1:17:12] and they desire to see this this church
[1:17:14] rise in the in the fullness of the Holy
[1:17:17] Spirit. They desire to see power going
[1:17:19] forth. We desire to see all everything
[1:17:22] that Calvary purchased.
[1:17:24] Amen.
[1:17:25] I want to see it moving here.
[1:17:27] Yes.
[1:17:28] But we were never it's not it's all
[1:17:30] about helping the people to apply it in
[1:17:32] their lives.
[1:17:33] So the so the ministry of Ephesians 4 in
[1:17:36] every age and in this last age
[1:17:37] particularly was not given to add to
[1:17:40] Elijah's teachings uh build a camp or a
[1:17:42] kingdom to themselves instead to help
[1:17:45] apply it. So, so, so, and and if there
[1:17:48] was ever, if I would, I'd say it like
[1:17:50] this. If there was ever an age at the
[1:17:54] very time when they're trying to cut
[1:17:55] that part off and just push play at the
[1:18:00] worst possible moment.
[1:18:02] Yes. Amen.
[1:18:03] Amen.
[1:18:04] At at the time when the world when God's
[1:18:07] family needs a five-fold ministry to
[1:18:10] have the sense of it and to apply it
[1:18:13] because every day it's getting worse and
[1:18:15] worse and worse and worse. And I
[1:18:16] understand uh how I had to apply it in
[1:18:19] the 70s and the 80s and the 90s and the
[1:18:21] early 2000s and the teens. But today,
[1:18:23] let me tell you something, friends. From
[1:18:24] the time of the fifth trumpet, when a
[1:18:26] fallen star, a fallen angel was fell
[1:18:29] from heaven and had a key to the
[1:18:31] bottomless pit and un and opened that
[1:18:33] bottomless pit, as brother Brandham
[1:18:35] said, uh in paraphrase, the lid is torn
[1:18:37] from hell and demon powers are now
[1:18:39] streaming in the earth. This is no time
[1:18:41] to set down a five-fold ministry. This
[1:18:44] is a time when we have to rededicate
[1:18:46] ourselves
[1:18:47] to rehumble ourselves in the presence of
[1:18:50] almighty God.
[1:18:51] Amen.
[1:18:52] Oh my. See, I mean, if it could be done
[1:18:56] without the work
[1:18:58] of God ordained, Holy Ghost fililled
[1:19:01] Amen five-fold ministry, then God would
[1:19:03] never have established it through Paul
[1:19:05] and confirmed it through Brother
[1:19:06] Brandham all through his ministry
[1:19:09] and hundreds of quotes. See, so Paul
[1:19:12] made it clear and Brother Brandham
[1:19:14] taught that they were what what are they
[1:19:16] for? They're for the perfecting of the
[1:19:18] saints. And and that that's a that
[1:19:20] culminates into something. That's a
[1:19:22] spiritual growth. It culminates in a
[1:19:24] spiritual growth as the Bible says into
[1:19:26] him in all things. Amen. Which is the
[1:19:29] head, even Christ. I'm getting
[1:19:30] sidetracked. I don't really want to do
[1:19:32] that. So, so, so whenever
[1:19:35] whenever we use
[1:19:37] descriptive terms that that sometimes,
[1:19:40] you know, such as a further
[1:19:42] understanding or a further work of the
[1:19:44] Holy Spirit, you know, we're it's only
[1:19:47] in the sense of the bride becoming a
[1:19:50] further manifestation.
[1:19:53] It doesn't need an another messenger. It
[1:19:56] doesn't need a eighth messenger or an
[1:19:58] eighth doctrine or an eighth age. It's
[1:20:01] not about that that we do go further.
[1:20:04] But that's only by what we already have
[1:20:07] is already finished. In that days of the
[1:20:09] voice of the seventh angel, the mystery
[1:20:11] is finished. But now a bride has to
[1:20:14] become the word.
[1:20:16] She's got to move on where that alpha
[1:20:18] church backslid and failed to achieve a
[1:20:21] body change. It was all in the design
[1:20:23] and plan of God. The seed had to go into
[1:20:25] the ground. I get that. We're not
[1:20:26] arguing against it. I'm just simply
[1:20:27] trying to say to you today, this is the
[1:20:29] hour that a bride, never before has it
[1:20:32] happened, that a bride all around the
[1:20:34] world is coming into the manifestation
[1:20:36] of the word.
[1:20:37] Amen.
[1:20:38] Amen.
[1:20:39] Hallelujah.
[1:20:40] And this is where we find ourselves.
[1:20:43] Hallelujah.
[1:20:45] This is where we find and I I I I love
[1:20:48] this statement a friend of mine made.
[1:20:51] The seventh seal breaking the silence
[1:20:54] revealing the mysteries which begin the
[1:20:57] process of winding up of all end time
[1:21:03] events.
[1:21:04] Hallelujah.
[1:21:07] I I'm I'm I'm done. I'm going to stop.
[1:21:10] But I want to leave you with that. You
[1:21:13] have come to the hour.
[1:21:14] Yes.
[1:21:15] When the seals have been broken
[1:21:19] and the mystery of the mighty God has
[1:21:21] been made known.
[1:21:22] Hallelujah.
[1:21:23] But now comes that that part. It not
[1:21:26] just now comes. It's been happening.
[1:21:28] And God is remember that's why brother
[1:21:30] Brandham said it all happens, you know,
[1:21:32] in a cluster. It it's all
[1:21:34] simultaneously. It's all working. the
[1:21:37] trumpets and the seals and the vials and
[1:21:39] the woes and they're all interchanged
[1:21:41] and it's all happening in history.
[1:21:43] And and this is why we we say to you
[1:21:45] friends that the rapture is coming in
[1:21:47] your lifetime because there's no other
[1:21:49] ages and there's no other message and
[1:21:51] there's no other star in his right hand.
[1:21:53] They've all been deployed.
[1:21:55] We're all the Jews are in their
[1:21:57] homeland. the political maneuvering
[1:21:59] that's going on. The trumpets have all
[1:22:01] the the the seventh plague, the seventh
[1:22:03] vial has already been released into the
[1:22:05] air,
[1:22:06] right?
[1:22:07] Only he Christ who now letth in the
[1:22:10] bride
[1:22:11] holding back the antichrist spirit only
[1:22:13] he will hold him back until he Christ in
[1:22:16] the bride be taken home.
[1:22:18] And then the whole things becomes a it
[1:22:20] becomes a tsunami. It becomes a deluge.
[1:22:22] It becomes global and it happens
[1:22:25] quickly.
[1:22:27] Behold, the third woe cometh quickly.
[1:22:29] The Bible says,
[1:22:31] "Oh, friends, I hope you're catching it.
[1:22:33] That you have reached an hour and you
[1:22:34] have reached a time. And God has not
[1:22:36] left us unprepared.
[1:22:38] He's not left us without the weapons of
[1:22:40] warfare that we need.
[1:22:43] But what we need is more of him. We need
[1:22:45] more more dedication. We need more
[1:22:47] consecration. This is the hour for the
[1:22:50] bride to shine."
[1:22:52] Hallelujah.
[1:22:53] It's never been needed. There's never
[1:22:56] been a greater need to push play than
[1:22:57] now.
[1:22:58] Yeah.
[1:22:58] There's never been a greater need for
[1:23:00] the five-fold ministry,
[1:23:02] right?
[1:23:02] To help the people learn how to to take
[1:23:04] the sense of it and and and and apply it
[1:23:07] into our lives.
[1:23:10] There's never been a greater need for
[1:23:12] that than now.
[1:23:15] You, your home, your family, your
[1:23:19] children, you've never needed the house
[1:23:21] of God more than now.
[1:23:23] Hallelujah. You've never needed
[1:23:25] listening to a tape more than now.
[1:23:26] You've never needed reading your Bible
[1:23:28] and praying more than now. You've never
[1:23:30] needed fellowship more than now.
[1:23:32] You've never needed the Lord's table
[1:23:34] more than now. You've never needed the
[1:23:35] power of God more than now. We have
[1:23:38] arrived. We're in the now. You are the
[1:23:40] now.
[1:23:42] Hallelujah. Friends, do you believe that
[1:23:43] today?
[1:23:45] The the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:23:48] and the bride has made herself ready.
[1:23:53] Amen.
[1:23:54] Hallelujah. Let's stand to our feet. I
[1:23:56] dare not go any further. We'll be here
[1:23:58] all day. My, as brother Gerald Hughes
[1:24:02] says, till the till the cows come home
[1:24:04] and the calves cry for buttermilk.
[1:24:08] Brother Lee, none of us know what that
[1:24:09] means, but we say it.
[1:24:12] Amen. Maybe a dairy farmer could tell
[1:24:14] me.
[1:24:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:18] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Do
[1:24:22] you love him with all your heart?
[1:24:23] Amen.
[1:24:24] Oh my. Can we sing that song? Blessed
[1:24:29] beless
[1:24:32] be blessed be your name your name.
[1:24:40] Oh blessed be. Oh blessed be.
[1:24:46] Oh, blessed be ye your name again. Now,
[1:24:51] blessed be. Oh, blessed be. Hallelujah,
[1:24:56] Lord. Blessed be.
[1:25:00] Oh, blessed be. Oh, your name. Your
[1:25:05] name.
[1:25:07] Blessed be. Oh, blessed be.
[1:25:14] Oh, blessed be your name and let your
[1:25:20] people proclaim
[1:25:22] [Applause]
[1:25:24] you are holy. Come on now, let's worship
[1:25:27] him. Oh, you are holy
[1:25:31] God. As we lift up your name
[1:25:37] and give gloryy,

[1:27:08] your name.
[1:27:10] Hallelujah.
[1:27:13] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:27:17] Amen. Let's bow our heads, friends, as
[1:27:19] they just play something. Whatever you
[1:27:21] choose, Brother Brad, just play softly.
[1:27:23] Father,
[1:27:26] how we love you today, Lord.
[1:27:28] How we thank you for your word that's
[1:27:31] come to us today. And I I I feel
[1:27:35] satisfied in my heart, Lord, that we
[1:27:37] were able to establish a direction and
[1:27:40] give the people enough to where they
[1:27:42] could catch a vision and catch an
[1:27:43] understanding. Lord, there's great
[1:27:46] things ahead. And we're we're not just
[1:27:48] looking somewhere over a rainbow. We're
[1:27:50] looking right now. We have arrived. We
[1:27:53] are the the last generation
[1:27:57] upon whom the ends of the world have
[1:27:59] come.
[1:28:01] We thank you for that, master. And I ask
[1:28:03] now today that all those Lord who are
[1:28:05] under the sound of my voice in this
[1:28:07] audience are across the airwaves. Lord,
[1:28:10] if there's anyone today in their heart
[1:28:12] and they heard the word strike them in
[1:28:15] such a way today that they know they're
[1:28:17] not quite where they need to be, I pray
[1:28:19] for them right now. If that's you,
[1:28:22] friends, with all heads bowed, if that's
[1:28:23] you, you want to raise up a hand to the
[1:28:25] Lord right now and just say, "Father, I
[1:28:27] got areas in my life I need to tighten
[1:28:29] up on." My I'll raise up both mine on
[1:28:31] that. Lord, there's so many places where
[1:28:34] I could be more, Lord, that that would
[1:28:37] enable you to do and accomplish more if
[1:28:39] I could just be more. Help us today,
[1:28:41] Lord God. this audience, Lord, the home
[1:28:44] folk here and many and some away out of
[1:28:47] town ministering, but wherever they are
[1:28:49] and all of our visitors in our camp and
[1:28:52] all those streaming, Lord, across the
[1:28:53] airwaves right now, we offer this prayer
[1:28:56] and we ask you to do that, Lord, in us
[1:28:58] which we so seem to not be able to do
[1:29:01] within ourselves. Grant it to us, Lord.
[1:29:03] Keep your word, keep your promise, Lord.
[1:29:05] We humble ourselves today.
[1:29:08] We repent, Father, of all of our sins
[1:29:10] and transgressions. We are sorry, Lord,
[1:29:13] that so often times we find ourselves
[1:29:15] short of the mark. Oh God, help us now
[1:29:18] today. I pray, Lord, it was so
[1:29:20] astonishing to me to hear a prophet even
[1:29:22] praying along that same line. Lord, just
[1:29:25] saying, "Father, I just fail you so
[1:29:27] often. I pray you would help me with all
[1:29:28] my failures and weaknesses and
[1:29:30] shortcomings. Lord, what an honest,
[1:29:32] humble man. I I believe, Lord, that all
[1:29:35] your men of God are that way down
[1:29:37] through the ages." We thank you today
[1:29:39] for this audience. We thank you today
[1:29:40] for this special occasion that we're
[1:29:43] turning to now. Lord, in your word, the
[1:29:45] promise in your word, for all those who
[1:29:48] would follow your word, you would fill
[1:29:51] them with your life. And from that hour,
[1:29:54] Lord, they would begin to be a brand new
[1:29:58] creation in Christ Jesus, knowing you in
[1:30:01] a way they had never known you before.
[1:30:03] Those devout Jews, they knew you, they
[1:30:05] knew about you, they had worshiped you.
[1:30:07] They were very devout. They live strict
[1:30:10] holiness lives, Lord, according to the
[1:30:12] law of Moses. But yet, they had to
[1:30:15] repent and they had to come further.
[1:30:16] They had to move higher. They had to go
[1:30:18] deeper in Christ. I pray, Lord, that
[1:30:22] you'll grant that to us all today as we
[1:30:25] look to you now in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:30:28] Praise the Lord. Amen. Wow. He moved you
[1:30:32] guys quick, didn't he? Praise the Lord.
[1:30:35] How How close are we, brother?
[1:30:38] Praise the Lord. We're ready. Amen. God
[1:30:43] bless you. I think um Are y'all seated?
[1:30:45] Y'all can be seated. Yeah, I think you
[1:30:47] can be seated. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:30:51] You going to help me, Brother Jack?
[1:30:52] Praise God. Brother Lee, it's a
[1:30:55] wonderful honor, brother.
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:31:04] No, he's getting some. He's good.
[1:31:07] [Music]
[1:31:13] Brother Jack, you got to be real careful
[1:31:15] here.
[1:31:21] All right. You're a big guy. If you
[1:31:23] fall, I don't know if I catch you or
[1:31:25] not.
[1:31:27] Amen. Praise the Lord,
[1:31:32] brother Lee. What an honor. Come on down
[1:31:34] in here, my brother.
[1:31:36] Amen. Let's see. Oh, they got your
[1:31:37] bathtub warm. You're going to be good,
[1:31:39] my brother. Yeah. Come right on. Come
[1:31:41] right on. Come right on. There you go.
[1:31:44] Uh, these deacons have took care of you,
[1:31:46] man. Praise the Lord. Now, you just
[1:31:48] stand right there for a minute. Let me
[1:31:50] just talk to you. We spoke back there in
[1:31:52] the back office, Brother Lee. Brother
[1:31:55] Lee Frasier
[1:31:56] and you know you had a background a
[1:31:59] family and a church but the Lord sent
[1:32:02] one of his children and crossed your
[1:32:05] paths and it was amazing because y'all
[1:32:07] both talked about how that brother Jack
[1:32:10] you've been around him for a long time
[1:32:11] and you never said a word. You never
[1:32:12] felt the uncction. See that's a lesson
[1:32:14] y'all. The sons of God are led by the
[1:32:18] spirit of God. And brother Jack
[1:32:20] sensitive to the Holy Spirit never said
[1:32:22] a word. Just you know what he did? He
[1:32:24] lived a word.
[1:32:26] He lived a word and caught the attention
[1:32:27] of this man. So that when he did utter
[1:32:30] human words, something struck in the
[1:32:33] heart here. And this brother saw it in
[1:32:36] the scripture. And now today, why is he
[1:32:37] here? Because he wants to obey all the
[1:32:40] words of God because he's realizing that
[1:32:43] there's more to be had. Oh, could we
[1:32:46] give him some testimonies of that today?
[1:32:48] There's more. Hallelujah, friends. Oh, I
[1:32:51] just say today, if you feel trapped in
[1:32:53] some man-made system, oh, there's
[1:32:55] heavenly heavens for you to soar in.
[1:32:58] Young people, there's a Holy Spirit,
[1:33:01] there's a Holy Ghost for you to soar in
[1:33:03] the realities of the living God. Brother
[1:33:06] Lee, you've read the scripture in Acts
[1:33:08] chapter 2. Yes, sir.
[1:33:10] See, and they had to repent and then
[1:33:12] they had to be baptized in the name of
[1:33:14] the Lord Jesus Christ. And when we look
[1:33:16] in the Bible, everyone that was ever
[1:33:18] baptized was baptized in the name of the
[1:33:20] Lord. Every last one of them. There was
[1:33:23] no one baptized in those titles
[1:33:25] according to Matthew 28:19 because Peter
[1:33:27] knew that the na that the titles were
[1:33:30] only titles to the name of the Lord
[1:33:32] Jesus Christ. See, and so that that is
[1:33:35] the beauty of the word of God. See now
[1:33:37] that that that that great eternal spirit
[1:33:41] could tabernacle himself into a man and
[1:33:44] then that man could send his life back
[1:33:47] inside of you. Now this might be strong
[1:33:50] but that makes you when you receive the
[1:33:53] Holy Ghost that makes you part of God's
[1:33:56] eternal Godhead. See
[1:33:59] and you take his name. There's no other
[1:34:02] name given among men whereby we must be
[1:34:04] saved. It doesn't matter. Baptist,
[1:34:07] Lutheran, Catholic, Presbyterian, UPC,
[1:34:09] doesn't matter those names. That's not
[1:34:11] how men are saved. They're saved by the
[1:34:13] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That's
[1:34:15] where salvation comes. Whatsoever you do
[1:34:18] in word or deed from this day, do all in
[1:34:21] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Let's
[1:34:23] pray. Father, we thank you for this
[1:34:26] wonderful opportunity. Lord, talking to
[1:34:29] the brother in the back room, I can see
[1:34:31] his wonderful spirit. Now, I pray, Lord,
[1:34:33] it's up to you. I believe that you've
[1:34:35] brought him here for such a time as
[1:34:36] this. I believe, Lord, that you're ready
[1:34:39] to now give him a higher walk and a
[1:34:41] deeper a deeper experience, Lord, in
[1:34:43] that realm, Lord, where a gene of God is
[1:34:46] perhaps laying. Oh, lamb of God, let it
[1:34:49] be so. Father, reveal everything to him
[1:34:52] that you have for him. And may he
[1:34:54] receive everything that you have for
[1:34:57] him. We commit it to you now. He's here
[1:35:00] to obey you in your word. And he said,
[1:35:02] "This is day one where he's going to
[1:35:04] begin to obey you more and more every
[1:35:06] day. We commit him into your hands now
[1:35:08] in Jesus Christ's name." Brother Lee,
[1:35:10] sit down on that ledge there. And all
[1:35:13] we're going to do, brother, sit down.
[1:35:14] There you go. Brother Jack, according to
[1:35:16] the word, uh, Brother Jack's going to
[1:35:18] help me now. We're going to take you
[1:35:19] straight on and bring you straight up.
[1:35:22] You understand? Straight down. Straight
[1:35:24] up. And you you can put your hand over
[1:35:27] your nose if you want to. You'll be back
[1:35:29] up and out of it. Thanks be to God, the
[1:35:32] Holy Ghost moves quick. Amen. So, we
[1:35:34] don't need to leave you in the grave.
[1:35:36] Amen. Jesus already spent almost three
[1:35:38] days there. You don't have to do that.
[1:35:40] Praise the Lord. Amen. Brother Lee
[1:35:43] Frasier,
[1:35:45] according to the scripture, according to
[1:35:47] God's promise that if you'd come and be
[1:35:49] baptized in his name, that the Holy
[1:35:51] Ghost, then you become entitled to it.
[1:35:54] My brother, we baptize you today. Help
[1:35:56] me put him down with Jack. In the name
[1:35:57] of the Lord Jesus Christ all the way.
[1:36:00] Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Stand
[1:36:04] up and rejoice my brother. Hallelujah.
[1:36:08] Lord, let your spirit fill him. Every
[1:36:10] fiber of him, oh God, from this hour,
[1:36:13] Lord, open his mind. Open his
[1:36:15] understanding of the word. We commit it
[1:36:17] to you now in Jesus name. Amen. Go
[1:36:21] rejoicing, my brother. Go in the love of
[1:36:23] God. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:36:26] Praise the name of God. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:29] Hallelujah. Go right there. The
[1:36:31] brother's waiting for you with a towel.
[1:36:32] Amen. Give the Lord another hand this
[1:36:34] morning this afternoon.
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:42] Hallelujah.
[1:36:44] [Music]
[1:36:46] Amen.
[1:36:48] Praise the Lord. Ain't it wonderful to
[1:36:50] see that?
[1:36:51] Yeah. My is it wonderful to know that
[1:36:53] you're working in the exact order that
[1:36:56] the early church worked in. You know, I
[1:36:58] you can read it right in the history
[1:37:00] books, right in the encyclopedias. I
[1:37:02] mean, it's as plain as anything. They
[1:37:04] even have a they even have a an actual
[1:37:08] rendering that's almost 2,000 years old
[1:37:11] in the early church where they baptized
[1:37:13] a man and they baptized him just like I
[1:37:15] just did in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:17] Christ. They they talked to him a little
[1:37:19] bit. Amen. The deacon talked to him.
[1:37:21] believe and he called his name. Yes,
[1:37:22] sir. I believe. Believest thou on
[1:37:24] Christ? Yes, I believe. Oh my. And put
[1:37:26] him right down underwater in the name of
[1:37:28] the Lord Jesus Christ. There is no other
[1:37:31] name given among men whereby we must be
[1:37:34] saved. We got in the future. We might
[1:37:36] need this pool again pretty soon. I got
[1:37:38] one young man who's already been
[1:37:40] baptized, been serving the Lord in a
[1:37:42] freshness, and wants to be rebaptized.
[1:37:44] So maybe we'll get to that uh in weeks
[1:37:46] to come. Amen. Anybody that wants to be
[1:37:49] baptized or rebaptized, I'm here to tell
[1:37:51] you something, friends. We're close to
[1:37:52] home. We're close to home. Amen. Praise
[1:37:54] the Lord. Let's stand back to our feet.
[1:37:56] What you going to sing, buddy?
[1:37:59] Blessed Lord, in the way thou has gone.
[1:38:03] Oh yes. Leading straight to the land
[1:38:08] above.
[1:38:10] Giving cheer everywhere to the sand and
[1:38:16] alone. Oh, fill my way every day with
[1:38:21] love. Come on now. Oh, fill my way every
[1:38:26] day with love.
[1:38:30] As I walk with the heavenly
[1:38:37] go
[1:38:40] with a song and a smile. Fill my way
[1:38:44] every day with love.
[1:38:49] Oh, keep me close to the side of myior
[1:38:54] and guide. Let me never in darkness
[1:38:59] road.
[1:39:01] Oh, keep my path free from wrath and my
[1:39:06] soul. Oh my. Oh, fill my way every day
[1:39:12] with love.
[1:39:12] Come on now. Right before we go, all
[1:39:14] together. Fill my way every day with
[1:39:18] love.
[1:39:20] Oh, as I walk with the heavenly.
[1:39:27] Oh, let me go all the while with a song
[1:39:32] and a smile. Fill my way every day. God
[1:39:37] bless you saints. You can be dismissed
[1:39:38] in Jesus name. Fill my way
[1:39:42] over
[1:39:44] the course. Oh, as I walk with the
[1:39:49] heavenly. God bless you. You're
[1:39:51] dismissed. Won't let me go all the while
[1:39:56] with a song and a smile. Fill my way
[1:40:01] every day with love.
[1:40:05] Soon this race will be over and I'll
[1:40:09] travel no more but abide in my home
[1:40:15] above.
[1:40:18] Let me sing blessed king all the way to
[1:40:23] the shore. Fill my way every day with
[1:40:28] love.
[1:40:31] Fill my way every day with love
[1:40:37] as I walk with the heavenly love.
[1:40:44] Let me go all the while with a song and
[1:40:49] a smile. Fill my way every day with
[1:40:54] love.
[1:40:57] Fill my way every day with love
[1:41:03] as I walk with the heavenly
[1:41:07] love.
[1:41:10] Let me go all the while with a song and
[1:41:15] a smile. Fill my way every day with
[1:41:20] love.
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:28] There is going to be a meeting in the
[1:41:33] air in that sweet, sweet by and by.
[1:41:40] I'm going to meet you and greet you over
[1:41:45] there in the land beyond the sky.
[1:41:52] Such singing you will hear. Never heard
[1:41:56] by mortal ear will be glorious. I do
[1:42:01] declare
[1:42:04] God's own son
