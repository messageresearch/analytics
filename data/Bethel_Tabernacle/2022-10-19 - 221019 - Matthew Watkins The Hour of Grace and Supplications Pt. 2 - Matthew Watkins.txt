for what the Lord would have for us this evening believeing he's got something specially prepared amen amen and so I know that he always comes where he's invited yes so you invited him right he's invited him said Lord come right to my come speak to my heart I trust that he will we have a Ser a special service here and I got some really special friends here with us um special friends of brother Travis and sister Deborah and uh this is brother Marcus Humphrey amen and Sister Mary so good to have them why don't we give the Lord Jesus a hand and if you don't know this is this is Marcus the brother that we were praying for um who was diagnosed with stage four Hopkins Loma and the Lord supernaturally healed him he's a standing praise God hallelujah if that don't build your faith I don't know what I got here tonight that will Amen to show that Jesus is still the same [Applause] yesterday and I tell you what that is not the man I seen uh just back in March when I was in their living room a man who was sick and dying and doctors had given not given much hope but Jesus had other plans we're so grateful for praise the Lord God has a purpose so we're going to have him come here I'm just going to minister something the Lord put upon my heart then we'll have Marcus I want you to come up and maybe greet the people and share uh a little bit of your testimony amen and what God it's his testimony that's what God did for him and Mary's amen and I know that they went through that together but we're here and we've got the victory amen Satan is a liar amen he's defeated he was defeated at Calvary and we've accepted that by faith here and he's a he's a testament of that here tonight amen praise the Lord Zechariah Chapter 12 we just want to minister to you on part two of the hour of Grace and supplications let's just begin reading here uh in Zechariah let me actually if you have that PowerPoint um brother uh Caleb just have that ready for me if you could I'm not going to get to it right away but uh we will turn there we will uh pull that up here in just a moment um Zechariah Chapter 12 the burden of the word of the Lord for Israel saith the Lord which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and forth the spirit of man within him behold I will make now notice as out the last time that we spoke on this this is not something that Israel was going to do but this is something God says I'm going to do now just while I have you standing let me just bring you up to speed here in Zachariah Zachariah was very much like uh Ezekiel and he was very much like Daniel in Daniel chapter 12 where his prophecy or what he speaks of part of it would be specific to Israel at the era that Zachariah lived but then he would turn to Zechariah 12 and he would begin to speak things that we would call apocalyptic or Endtime prophecy Daniel does this in Daniel 12 and he begins to speak of symbology and you see some of the same symbols that you find in Revelations Ezekiel does the same thing he sees the will in the middle of a will and so we know that Zachariah is speaking here of a Time time's very important remember don't think of when we say God is timeless it doesn't mean God is outside of time but that all time is inside of God it's very important how you look at that make you make God that he's Timeless and that he doesn't care what happens in time no he actually David said all of my time here on Earth from the first breath to my last is in your hands and so notice here Zachariah is going to begin to speak about something prophetic that would come now we know in Zechariah 12 he's speaking of Armageddon and we know that that's the war of all Wars the end of all things the Day of Reckoning of all humanity and all time now brother Brandon would say it this way that the war of Armageddon was the final battle or the final chapter in the war that started in heaven when Michael prevailed over Lucifer and kicked him out of heaven and he came to Earth and he would say it this way Heavenly battles became Earthly battles and so throughout all time in all history everything from the beginning when Adam and Eve are kicked out of the Garden of Eden all the way through the prophets the Kings the priests all the way to Jesus Beyond Jesus the New Testament Church beyond the New Testament Church all of the ages all the way till 2022 God has been pulling the levers and God has been pushing the buttons not man now man is the god uses men but men come under the anointing of the Potter who is working his vessel behold I will make Jerusalem a couple of trembling unto all people round about when they shall be in Siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem verse three and in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all people of the earth be gathered together against it and that day sayeth the Lord I will Smite let's move on down and I want to say it's verse uh eight let me just pull it up here and that Day verse eight in that day shall the Lord capital L O R D here's Jehovah this is God in that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem there is no one that defends his people greater no one who you'd rather have on your side than the Lord and he says I will defend Jerusalem and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David so the spirit of David comes back upon these Jews upon this people and he says and the House of David shall be as God as the angel of the Lord from before them verse 9 here's our verse here and it shall come to pass that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem verse 10 and I will pour upon the House of David notice not to all Israel not to all of the the nation but upon this house and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem here's what he's going to pour out the spirit of Grace unmar didn't deserve it don't know why I received it but somehow I have Grace and supplications Lord Jesus we just bow our heads here before you now Lord just we come subservient Lord to your spirit for Lord truly we're here Lord only as a tool in your toolbox I pray God that you would use me Lord tonight God by the inspiration of your word you've placed something just a little thought upon my heart I pray father that each and every person that would be here Lord would be sensitive to your spirit that wants to speak to them I pray God I pray you would just keep me from saying anything that would be displeasing to you Lord or something that would be contrary I pray you would just have complete control in this service we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated and he says I'll pour out the spirit of Grace and supplication so he says the spirit of Grace I could just stop here and and there's so much I'm not going to get to get to tonight and that's all right Lord will have another time for us I'm sure but he pours out the spirit of Grace now this is what the people need the most this is the stubborn hard-hearted stiff necked people as they were as their history tells us stiff necked and hard-hearted but God is going to give them what they need the most he going to pour out his spirit of Grace unmar favor didn't deserve it don't deserve it but I'm going to pour it out upon you and he says and the spirit of supplications this was such a powerful thing when I read this because if you click up on the Lexicon the meaning of this word desperations it means prayer and that's wonderful it's wonderful that he gives them the spirit of prayer thought it was amazing because here he's going to pour out thank you he's going to pour out the spirit of Grace and prayer and so there's a there's something that comes upon them Zechariah 14 we'll just skip it and not you not take the time to read it because we read it last time and he says behold I'll gather all nations against Jerusalem I'll gather a United Nations Army now there's a bright future coming for Benjamin there's a bright future coming for Israel there's a bright future but before the brightness comes the most horrible day that Humanity has ever experienced amen the Bible says it this way that there's never been a day like it Jesus said this in the Book of Matthew there's never been a day like it and there will never be another day like it again it's called the day of the Lord now you know that you could look at this and say Israel has had many days that you could say were times of great trouble uh they've had many times you could just look at their history and the but the Bible says that there's never been there's there's such as a day as never was before even to that time so the Jew the Jewish people have known many days of trouble they've known many times of trouble this is what the Bible refers to as Jacob's trouble they've known many times of trouble you could just look historically here and know that it's a people who've been troubled from the very beginning of their history when Adam uh curses the entire human race and they go out from the Garden of Eden and they and they and they sojourn into the world there's been nothing but sorrow as was prophesied and was promised there's been Horrors that have fallen upon this people from the fall of Samaria all the way to the tearing of the kingdoms between the North and the South to the you go read the book of mccabes it's amazing history of a man named Antiochus epiphanies and just was a tyrant almost like Hitler and some of the things and it was Jude the house of Judah Benjamin Judah Who Rose up the the war of the macbes uh that that that that fought against this man and his army you can read all the way through the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans also we read about it in the Bible by Nebuchadnezzar when he takes them into captivity into Babylon uh the persecution throughout the church uh through through the church through the through the Dark Ages excuse me uh to the 20th century just here not long ago the Holocaust yeah amen and so it's just been trouble after trouble after trouble after trouble but yet the Bible says this will be worse than any of those troubles this is a day that'll be worse than all of those combined there's never been a day like it there'll never be another day like it let me say this that when the day of the Lord comes you better be on the Lord's Side when the day of battle comes you better be on the right side of the army cuz you're not facing a General you're not facing Putin you're not facing a nuclear bomb you're facing god Jehovah the creator of the heavens and the Earth and so this will be a worse time than any other time and he says I'll gather all nations in Zechariah 14 against Jerusalem to battle and he says and the the houses will be rifled and he speaks of just in in detail of of just some Horrors that'll befall that nation and that city as all the nations of G Gentile armies all the nations a United Nations Army has unified and solidified against this nation now what's amazing is that they don't know it but God is the one who said I'll gather all nations so will it'll be it'll be oh it's just the agenda of this Republican or this Democrat or it's Putin or it's over here don't you realize these are just puppets in the hands of God who's controlling all time by a book of prophecy this isn't a newspaper or just a good book or a novel this is controlling his story this isn't H it's not history it teach you history in school do you realize history is just his story it's the drama that's unfolding and you're part of it and I'm part of it and I want to say Lord what's my purpose in all of it so he's controlling all things he brings all these nations against Israel and God says in Zechariah chapter 14 because I'm going to bring all those Nations and I thought it's incredible here's one spot brings them to one stage at one geographic location so that his Cup of Wrath can be poured out upon all those Nations because at the day when it seems like all hope is lost the Bible says the Lord steps in the battle and when the Lord comes to your Aid I wouldn't rather have any you wouldn't want anybody to can fight for you than to say Lord fight my battles I'll stand behind Lord and I'll keep just praising you and worshiping you as you go Mighty in battle in my life am and so we we know this that here from history even from time all the way from the beginning time was going to be a very important thing to God we know that Israel is his time piece you want to know where you're at where God is at in the Gentile dispensation the grace age which we're still under right now but there's coming a day where the Bible says when the fullness of the Gentiles comes and when Grace is over I'm glad it's not right now there's still mercy here at on The Mercy Seat and so but we know that that there will come a time when that gospel goes back to that Nation when he that is filthy will be filthy when he that is Holy will be holy when he that lth will let till he be taken out of the way we know all of the the prophecies that speak of a Time friends let me just say it this way I believe we're approaching those moments right now it's not just an accident time it's not just a clock that someone's wound up and it's just spinning and it'll stop at any given random moment no but God has a specific time and a specific day and a specific moment when God says the end and John said it this way in the Book of Revelations time shall be no more amen and so you say what happens at that moment then whatever you are he that is filthy let him be filthy he that is Holy let him be holy that's why the Bible says make your calling an election sure because the only thing you take with you when you leave this world is the character that God has molded in you and it better be I say Lord let it be a reflection of Jesus Christ let my life be a a a conduit it for the reflection of Christ and so notice here if you have that second power point the God of all time brother the Caleb the one you could put up notice here just for a moment as we look at this as we know this thing that we we would call time and I I don't have really the time speaking of time to really cover this how I want to but we'll just get to what we can and then we'll leave the rest as to the Lord and so notice here I if you look at this we we ministered on this years ago here at the church I'm just going to cover some principles that we covered then but we notice here it would we be what they would call academically as the philosophy of History anybody writing a book or or who's who's studying or historian they're going to have a certain philosophy it just means how they View events in the past in the present and events coming how they view how do you view this linear line that we call time and we understand everything about it not just the time of yesterday but we understand our own life as time I was young I was a teen I grew up and now you look always in the past and then you're planning your future then you're here you are in your present so you judge everything and you measure everything by time that's how God made us we're creatures of time and so we're subject to that and so none of us are getting any younger amen right none of us are getting any and you know all of us are we're not we're you know you can do things to improve yourself and to improve your health and that's wonderful the Bible says bodily exercise profiteth hold on I didn't say to say that the bodily exercise profiteth don't miss it it does profit it might be little I is it amazing how everyone just love to waake up little you beat me to the punchline body bodily exercise profited little So you you're you're always breaking down you're on a constant cycle of breaking down even even even even in your own body here today your body's always dying all the time or always moving one one step closer to the Grave our time is going to run out one day oh but it's only a a contrast of a negative to a positive if there's a world that has death and there must be a world that has life if there's a place where people get old there must be a place where people are young if there's a place where there's sickness there must be it's law of contrast a place where there's no aging and no no sorrow and no sickness I love how the Apostle Paul said if in this life only I had hope I would be of all men most miserable if only this life was and you take all of the best moments of life and you can have some good ones you can have some photographs and show some of the best moments of your life and there's High Times I'm thankful for God giving us times of vacation and Times of joy we enjoy our our time with our little ones and our children as we watch them grow we we we we enjoy each other's company each other's Fellowship you could go and travel the world and see some beautiful magnificent places and your life could be filled I believe God gives you times of goodness in your life even on this side of Eternity now without Christ they all mean nothing without Christ it's all meaningless and hopeless but you can even have good times you can have great times but let me just say this you could you could pile all of them together and and and and if life's meaning was just this life only could you imagine could you imagine after you You' have loved ones who you love and you watch them go and you take them to the to and you you visit them at the graveyard and at the cemetery and that's could you imagine if this was it if this was all right amen one man said it and it's it's always stuck with he said life would just seem like a sick joke that someone played on me you know I can relate with that and say as you get older you start to realize there's sorrow that comes with life there's hard times that come with life and if all if all I had was just this life oh it just makes me stop and say I'm so thankful for a reality of an eternity I'm so thankful for a reality that this life is not the end of it all oh this life is not where it all stops when you breathe your Last Breath it's where it all begins and I've tasted of that how do you know it's real because I've tasted of a little piece a little portion of it here it's why the Bible calls grieve not the Holy Spirit where whereby you're sealed until the day of your Redemption what is the Holy Ghost it's the earnest means the down payment so I've received the down payment and God's going to pay the rest of the bill one day notice this here and and so you have have all of the philosophy that you could look at time means how do you look at time how do you look at this linear line of time and men have different views on this and it's very important with what with what lens they view time and the pattern of events that happen not only in our lifetime but lifetimes gone by that we read about and study about and so when you when you when you when you look at this here the the the the if you go to the next slide I don't know if I have I do good pray the Lord I'll I'll go ahead and Advance it here if I have it good thank you these are way too small to read I'll read some of them for you but these are the different the these are the different views we could call it that of of History you have this what they call the cyclic View and it just means that history's just a big cycle it's just like a big roundabout it's just going around and around and around it's really going nowhere there's no pattern there's no purpose it's just time is just this big clock that man has you know wound up and it's just unwinding and unwinding and and one day whenever that stops winding it's just going it just and history just keeps repeating and it does there's truths to all of these history just repeats itself over and there's yesterday we had good news and then tomorrow had bad news and my grandpa had good news and then he had bad his grandpa had good news then bad news his grandpa before him had it's just one big I'm just here and this is just my part and we're just going in a circle you know just like a roundabout just a a big old roundabout you know like like we you see around here you just sort of get on the roundabout you know when you come into life and and then you get a career and you go to college and you find your vocation in life and then you pursue that then you get a family and you have children and then you just you just go through this cycle of life where you wake up every morning you tell your family goodbye you go to work that day you spend the day at work you come home you greet your family greet your kids veg on entertainment go to bed wake up the next day go back to the job work full eight eight hours a day come home greet the family see see the children vegal entertainment go back to bed wake up the next day go back to work work eight hours a day spend the day get home greet the kids veg on entertainment then you go to bed then you wake up oh my and you just get on this long roundabout with really no direction and I'm just living life I'm just aimless and and then really The Man Without God this is really his life it's just a a big circle just a big old roundabout you know the point of that roundabout is to get off of the roundabout you don't go on a traffic circle and just go around and around and around and around and around if you do people think he is not from here that's a northerner excuse me he's not from here why they just go around and around in people's lives so this way they just go around and around and it's one up day uh day one one day is up and one day's down and one day's up and one day is down and they just go they just get off they get on the roundabout and they get off about where they got on they retire then they they just fade off you know this is I thought about this today and I know preaching another sermon here but I was thinking about this just this afternoon I thought it's just like the Book of Judges where the Bible says in judges they had a judge and the people serve God as long as the judge was alive then when the judge would die they'd go back into sin they'd get into slavery they'd get into bondage God would send them Deborah he'd send them Samson and oil all these judges all these men then they would serve God and they would come to Revival and then they would right when that judge would die right when Grandpa's dead and and Grandma's dead and that that anchor that was in their life then they fall right back into sin go into slavery into bondage then God sends another judge and it's just this repeated circle of Circle of up and up and down but you know what's so powerful about that Circle in judges is that judges in the Book of Ruth were originally bound together in the Jewish Bible today judges and Ruth is one book because why what was going to be different about Judges Ruth was not going to be a circle Ruth was going to be a line it was going to be a progression it was going to lead to a Royal Line it wasn't about circles and going up and going down and going up and going down but it was going to be about a destiny a purpose a calling a plan that God had planned for this little woman and she had a future and it wasn't a future of Judges circles but it was a future to go on a Royal Line and bring forth the promise of God in her life do you realize friends we've not been called to the circle of the rest of the world of the grind but you're part of a Plan of Redemption amen and you've got to recognize I'm part of the story that's unfolding here amen it just repeats and goes around and around and then you have the Epic View and it goes forward but it goes forward in ups and downs and you hope your life ends on and up and not a down you go up and then you go down and good times and there's bad times there's rich people and there's poor people there's inflation and then there's deflation that's how they view history and this this epic view then you have the the optimistic view now this is incredible because this optic M view of history says history is getting better and better all all the time we're progressing it's Progressive it's just going better things are going to get better this optimistic view life is we're we're we're increasing this it's almost like a the the the the you know this is heaven on Earth and some people This Is How They view life it's just get better it's all about here and just make my life better let because we're getting better science has advanced I'm thankful science has I'm thankful for modern medicine amen but that view that that is just going it's going to get better and life is is getting better all the time this was the most common view held at in the 1900s it's the most common view that some it all up in this one word progress life is just going to get better time is just going to go get better you know history uh uh science is going to keep discovering this was the isn't about Earth is not about a curse Earth is about a blessing life on and Earth is in humanity is all about it's it's uh what what can we have here now not what we invest for tomorrow but Jesus says where your treasure is there your heart will be also so if you treasure this life and this is where your Treasures are this is where your heart will be also right and so this was the this was thought that the 20th century was going to be the best Century it was going to be the best age ever with all the modern discoveries it's going to help us discover and and and and fix all of our problems life is going to be good it was just going to get better and better man's evolving education in evolving education and Science and Technology and boy do we have it ever than we ever have we've had it more than we now than we ever have before yeah right and science is just going to get better and they entered the 20th century with this High Hope a British prime minister heard a man speaking this the other day he went he won an entire election on that slogan up and up and up and on and on and on up and up and up and on and on and on progress and then they built a boat called the Titanic and they said we're going to build a boat our technology is so powerful this age is so one just such optimism that not even God himself can sink it this was the largest manmade moving object ever built and inside of this largest ever built object was in identified I thought this is incredible all of the latest cuttingedge technology at that time were all housed in this boat this was man's greatest achievements it was the symbol of optimism it was the symbol of hope it was the symbol of progress and man said it's so powerful and so good we've created such an invention that not even God himself can sink it so you know what God did yeah yep he sunk it and with the Titanic going to the bottom of the ocean still today the Titanic the most popular shipwreck in history with the Titanic going to the bottom of the ocean the all of that B all of that progress and all of that High Hope was like a bubble that you popped and this was the first major disaster of the 20th century and what what did it do and now it's a challenge to man and you know you say brother the mat then what followed that World War I and now the entire world goes to war this was supposed to be the best of the best it was supposed to be the greatest of the greatest man is going up and Darwin said we're evolving we're getting better science and social and and and our culture would just we'll get Kinder we'll get nicer we'll get happier we'll get more joy more money means more joy but what did what did it produce addictions and drugs and alcohol and depression and anxiety what is technology really brought the world Amen he's gone completely insane yes and what was thought to be as the greatest turned out to be the worst yeah amen it turned out to be the worst all the optimistic view of History uh turned out to be the worst so then what did you you have you have the pessimistic I think I had on the ne the next slide there the pessimistic I don't like pessimism I'm not a pessimistic person I don't believe Christians should be pessimistic people we're called to be optim optimistic people that's not just a car a personality trait a Christian always sees the glass half full not half empty but this was the pessimistic view of history that it's not getting better it's getting worse worse and worse and worse and and destruction is unavoidable and there's global warming and the melting of the polar caps and it's all going to go towards doom and destruction and the whole world's going to end they're right am so what do you have you have the optimistic view who look towards something man always has a good desire but the Devil comes in and perverts it and then you have the pessimistic view you can represent these uh you could you could you could represent these even by L here you have the cycle then you have the Epic view uh that that goes like that then you have the optimistic view where time and history is getting better and better and better and then you came with the pessimistic view to where everything's getting worse and we're not getting better we're going worse and worse and history is getting worse and times and people are getting more evil and they're right they are time man is slowly destroying himself if you haven't read the news lately and I'm not recommending that you do man's getting worse wor time's getting worse history is getting worse man is going completely insane the only sanity is in Christ the only peace is not in money or women or popularity or Hollywood or education or or whatever they want drugs they want to give people the only opium that I need as a man is this opium right here this is all of my joy is David said this is my portion this is my daily bread all of my happiness comes from this word that's right and so pessimism what is it it's getting worse and it's getting worse and they're right but let me tell you we don't believe in an optimistic or a pessimistic view you say what view do you view time with I have the God view I have the view where things will get worse and worse and worse but suddenly at the bottom of it all when it goes completely insane suddenly after it gets all the way to the bottom out of nowhere there's a Rapture of the church this is what the Bible calls the harpazo which is just a word to mean we shall be called up which means to be snatched it means to be snatched I say Lord snatch me I'm ready right now God get me out of all of it Lord this is my hope I'm looking for this is how I'm viewing time and my life and all of it is that God has a plan and he's working all things after his his purposes amen and he's got a purpose you believe that he's got a a purpose a purpose and I'm in the middle of all of that you know when I let me just say this and stop for a moment and say when I read the word of God I'm glad I can read the history I can read what what God did in Israel I could read what God did in the in the gospels I could read what God did in the New Testament Church but when I read the Bible I'm not just reading it as history I'm read that it's his story and in his story I want to say God where am I where's my purpose Lord what have you called me to Lord it's one thing to recognize God in yesterday or God in tomorrow but where's he at right now come on Church do we believe he's the same yesterday today and forever am he he said I'll have a church that has no spotter no wrinkle or blemish or any such thing and Revelations the the lady ofan church he said to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me on my Throne what does that tell me that in this age of Darkness there's going to be somebody who overcomes the devil the Bible says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony what is a testimony it's a test I think it was brother Donnie or maybe it wasn't said what is breakdown testimony test I moany God gives me a testing I'm moany we moan over it but it's it's for our good it's for our Perfection God sends it in our life to produce desperation in our hearts do you realize that this is why God sends trouble to the believer it's not to produce bitterness it's not to produce anger towards God it's just the Bible says he never laid charge on God he never blamed God and through all of it but T but but but pressure comes God sends and allows pressure in your life and God could bring that pressure through manifold Temptation manifold trial manifold uh storms that would just mean it would be various it'd be something different for everybody let me tell you something here tonight if you feel like that you're in the greatest battle you've ever fought let me just tell you I am too brother if you feel like you're under some of the greatest pressure you've ever been let can somebody else witness and say you're not alone in that if you feel like that all hell is against you let me just tell you if the devil told you he's only against you that's a lie he's against all of us if you feel like you're in the greatest time and the some of facing some of the darkest times of your life let me just tell you he's attacking on all sides just as all Nation surrounded Israel all the faculty and and Kingdom of Satan has been raging against you because you're a believer of the word of God but just as he pours out a spirit of Grace and supplication on them he's pouring it out upon us and I just raise my hand and say Lord let me receive your spirit of Grace cuz I need it more than anything else and if you've got to Pro give me trials to produce desperation that's that's I didn't I didn't say that I thought it was incredible when I looked up that word he pours out I'll pour out upon the House of David the spirit of Grace and supplications and I clicked a little deeper in the Lexicon and it gave me the definition not just prayer but desperate prayer and I thought out of more than anything else listen you cannot I'm going to close you cannot manufacture desperation you can't you can't with all of your all of your willpower no matter how you say I just I'm so desperate listen you that's not something you can choose you know what that is that's a result that's a fruit of of of like the olive you know how you get the olive oil because you crush the olive yeah and then you get the olive oil this is what Jesus was in Gethsemane that's what Gethsemane means it's the crushing yeah man it got quiet awfully fast it's the crushing it's the it's the pressure and it's the breaking and so Gethsemane was a it was a crushing I thought about this today you you can't you can't produce it you need it more than anything else you need desperation sister Brenda Lewis wrote a song maybe some of you have never heard it called lord make me Des desate lest I perish make me to hunger and thirst for you amen you can't hunger and thirst for him hunger is not something that you manufacture it's something that you just have and I say Lord make me to hunger and thirst if I've became so distracted by this world and the cares of this life that I've got my attention and my focus off of your story then Lord make me to hunger how many could pray that here with me and say Lord Make Me desperate make me desperate Lord no matter what you got to send me through this is the hour of Grace and supplications and God is producing pressure oh I I I just want to I feel like that's so from the Holy Spirit right now that pressure you feel in your life that might be you say who is that come who is that the Lord may allow the devil as he as he allowed the devil to afflict job but let me tell you something the devil couldn't touch job unless God gave him permission and the devil can't touch you you're a son and daughter of God Satan came and said you got job hedged up I can't even get to him the devil let us in on a secret that for the Sons and Daughters of God he has you hedged up it's why the Bible says the angels of the Lord encamp those that fear Him you may not see them you may not feel them you may not hear them take confidence tonight there's Angels surrounding your home there's Angels surrounding your life there's angels that are watching your children when you let them out of your when you when you send them to school or you send them to work there's an Angelic presence that covers God's family amen and he can't touch you unless God gives him permission first and so what does God do to produce desperation he brings you through pressure yes amen amen and he brings you through some some some some some moments in your life to where it looks like that God has just gone and you say why did this happen to me and how could this befall me and what did I do the first that question you Lord what have I done you start to turn over every stone and law and you begin to where did I go wrong and where did I go off course and I look at my life and and God doesn't answer my prayer anymore and I just feel so far and I feel like the I I I used to talk to him and I used to sense his presence and now it must have been something I've done I'm sure I missed a turn I'm sure I went all that's exactly what the devil wants to lie to you and get you to accept what is it it's God producing pressure in your life so that it'll produce desperation to say Lord I don't want to miss you I want to be ready Lord I want to be fervent I want to be that that virgin in the Bible the wise virgin who was burning the midnight oil amen and she was trimming her lamp Prophet said that I had to quote this is lamp trimming time this is lamp trimming time and I say Lord let me trim my lamp let me make sure I've got the oil of the Holy Ghost I don't want to be like that foolish virgin who the Bible says when the master came that they didn't have no oil in their vessel amen they go to the city and buy can we have some we don't have enough to spare only enough for oursel amen then what do do go to the city the Bible says when the bride when the groom came and they came backwards yeah he was already gone oh friend let me to say don't be called unaware that's not your destiny that's not your purpose there's others who will fulfill that but you're not called to fulfill that you're not the licorn believer of Lady OA you're the Overcomer of this age you're not those who are laxad desico and all you want is a feel-good sermon and a good feel-good comfort zone Vibes but we want to say Lord give us your word alive and living let it be something that feeds us Lord and is real in our life oh that's why God has given you the faith for the supernatural why it's part of your inheritance We Believe for that we look for that not just a god of yesterday but a god of today who's alive amen who speaks and we hear Hallelujah who speaks and we hear that still Small Voice not always in a big booming loud as Elijah went through the earthquake and through the fire and and and and and through the wind but but the Bible says God wasn't in any of that he was in that still Small Voice I say Lord let me be sensitive enough to hear that voice because when he speaks oh it's not the voice of a man speaking it's not the voice of a man that can fail but when he speaks he dissolves all doubts oh friends can you can you witness that here tonight you might have searched for answers and you might have got good advice from this man or this woman or this brother sister but really when God speaks amen it answers all questions it removes all doubt and you realize your purpose and your calling and you say Lord what do you have me to do I want to be ready I want to be a servant that can be yielded and ready Lord I want to be ready Lord when your spirit gives me unction don't let me be so distracted that I miss it Lord let me be sensitive to that voice Grant it Lord the hour of Grace and supplications let's all stand to our feet this evening you believe in a supernatural God amen a God who proves himself alive that he's the same yesterday today and forever why don't we just bow our heads just for a moment before I invite our brother Marcus to come Lord Jesus here we bow Lord just feeling sensing Lord your presence so near Lord we're thankful Lord Jesus more than anything God we just want to say we're thankful that lord it's not by by might it's not by power but it's by my spirit sayeth the Lord It's not him who runneth or him that willth but God that showeth Mercy Lord all of these scriptures that we could quote here tonight Lord they prove one thing lord it's not up to us to manufacture it's not us up to us to whoop up or to build up or to try our best or determine in ourselves it's just up to us to yield and to surrender and to become subservient and humble ourselves enough to become subservient Lord and submissive to whatever your word says I just raise my hand and say Lord I accept it here tonight I yield all my thoughts I yield all of my opinions I check them at the door and I say as Paul said I know nothing except Jesus Christ and him crucified let me know nothing Lord let my life be made up of not my agenda or my plan or what I've what I've sought out to do Lord but let me say let me find my purpose God what are what's this great Potter calling my life to be where do you want me to be where do you want me to where do where where do you want my life let me find myself aligned with that heavenly vision Lord I want to be in syn and in step to it tonight Lord Jesus we ask we thank you Lord for the trials and the tribulations that you pour out upon us father Lord help us to not let them become and make us bitter or make us angry Lord but if let it do what it's a purpose is to do and that's to produce desperation in our life that we could say Lord draw us closer to you than we've ever been before draw Our Lives closer to match your word more than it's ever been before Lord Jesus we ask we pray that you would Grant it Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen you can be seated again I want to take this time now and invite Marcus to come and we've got some we have those you want to come now Marcus amen amen why why don't we give the Lord Jesus and our brother a hand give him a good hand clap of Praise Hallelujah you come on right here and I have those pictures you just call for them and they'll they'll display them amen God bless you God bless you take your Liberty take your time thank you let the Lord be praised amen we are so glad to be in the house of the Lord amen amen as we grew up learning one more time because you never know when it might be your last time and we are faithful to the calling if you're not faithful to the calling you're missing out on the blessing God has given us as I heard pastors say a testimony and that testimony doesn't come without a test and I don't know who I'm talking to and God I I prayed and I said Okay God even on the way over here give us the right words to say I don't want to go up there and speak for me I want to speak for you and let everything that I say tonight bring you glory and I understand now better than I ever have in all my life I'm a man of 68 years years ago I I I had a heart's yearning and desire to go on the missions field and God has allowed my wife Mary and I to smuggle Bibles into China wow I made history in the pastor's Church in the Philippines he announced at the end of my message you have made history you're the first black man he said to ever preach from my pull pit I said God use us he's taken us to Mexico to Jamaica we were in Romania serving the people who were homeless and living under the salt under the streets down there with the infrastructure and visiting the hospitals where young people and older parents who were trying to keep themselves warmed and their cold temperatures would burn severely and did not have anything to treat the the burns except Vaseline and you know what Vaseline does to Burns increases the the burn when we showed up when we had medical treatment that we took from for with a team we purchased burn cream and we showed up because they told us you have to put this garment on and we looked like the medical staff but when we walked in and they all looked at us and feared our presence because we look like everybody else and they didn't want any more of this cream this Vaseline but we had healing bomb I'm going to want you to think on that word healing bom to apply to severe burns severe injuries somebody here tonight has been severely injured and God has brought you through he's come and knocked at your door because he is the healing bom and he's waiting for you to receive him I did not know that in January well late December as a school teacher over in Savannah I would drive from Buford to Savannah and teach elementary school and when I said to my students I'll see you next year it was our Christmas break we didn't know that the enemy had a different plan so I long ago asked God to use in Ministry and also allow me to be a teacher well he's given me a prophetic Ministry and he's also allowed me to teach in my Ministry and as I made several trips to South Sudan walked the grounds at a 115 degree temperature my pastor friend and I walked nearly 10 miles carrying our backs to get to a village of 16,000 refugees who had fled the assault of a machete and assault rifles they slept in the bush and one young man who was one of the refugees from years past talked about as a young teenage boy running with thousands of other young men and coming across a fallen elephant and having to eat from the the meat he was one of the stronger ones who could tear that flesh of an elephant with his own teeth and then bite it into smaller bites to give to the younger boys so they could survive having lost his own parents behind him he kept pressing forward I want you to think on that pressing forward in the latter part of December my testimony I can't get it all without asking my wife Mary my bride of 46 years to come and and help me out and I'll call her up and she'll she'll help me with the specific details but as I we were preparing to go to Florida with family our daughter and grandkids we were going to go and I was a passenger Mary and Jess our daughter was up front and I'm sitting behind entertaining the kids behind me and I'm leaned over because there was a little irritation on the side of my neck on the right side right here felt like about the size of your knuckle if you pull it up like that and just pinch it off there's a little bump there and I thought what it's not a shaving bump I don't know what that is and I leaned forward and said to my wife and daughter do you see this anybody else see this I can see what I feel and they looked at it Mary saids do you think we should go home and I said no we'll be fine let's just go on and have a good time at the end of our Florida trip we were to go to San Diego visit our son and daughter-in-law for Christmas they had invited and sent tickets for us to come out so it was at the end of our coming back we were going out for Christmas Day and coming back on the 29th is that right in the two weeks span of time this little irritation of a bump that Mary says was about the size of an avocado seed had grown to where it was pushing up behind my right ear and down under my clavicle big Mass before getting the attention that we needed God was using this to his glory an oncologist who was alarmed at at the report of Dr Kenneth Brown some of you may know him he's a ear nose and throat specialist here in Buford I'd gone to him because my daughter-in-law in bluon who's a nurse said Dad this is not something you take to your general practitioner you need to go see an ear nose and throat specialist I called Dr Brown he had me come in he diagnosed and thought it was a cyst gave me the name of that cist and I went back home and Googled images and it looked just like what I had looking at in the mirror and I said okay he's spot on he called it what it is and uh he liked to take a biopsy of it they took a biopsy of it and then when they came back and he called and spoke to Mary and said I don't know what it is but I don't it's spreading very quickly not sure if it was Mal malignant or beny but he said I need to get in touch with some oncologist and then one oncologist they called him back out of several calls on January 12 says I can see him Dr Brown says got good news he said the problem is I can't see him until the 19th Dr Brown's response was if we wait till the 19th I don't think he'll be here wow what's today's date this is in January that was a devil's plan yeah I heard pastors say God's Got A Plan you know sometimes we look for joyful moments happy moments and we look to eliminate all the trials and troubles and no we're looking for a way out by eliminating all those challenges that life will bring our way but I want to tell you that it is through those things that we'll find our joy Pastor said all your answers are going to come right here and I'm going to tell you he spot on because what we found out is that because of that report from the oncologist that says I can see in in seven days Dr Brown moved right on we got in touch with the MUSC up in Charleston and we were taken in and I literally spent seven months I've gone through six rounds of failed chemo the doctors outlined we'll do this first step if that fails we'll go to this step if that fails we'll go to step three step four if that fills we're probably going to go to car T something I never heard of they would harvest my cells Harvest SE tea cells they would hook me up to a machine that would take blood through a portal feed it into a machine that's running constantly for five hours long now I'm looking at the blood going through this tubing going into that machine and some coming back into my body and then this little bag that's hanging on a pole that's empty is now filling up with tea cell tea blood cells I said how do you know when it's going to get enough they already programmed it the machine would automatically cut off when it had enough God gave man the mind to come up with something something so elaborate talking about technology being Advanced Pastor just didn't know how much he was telling my story The advancement of Technology allowed man to come up with a machine that would empty blood out of my body put the good stuff back in here and harvest tea cells that they would send off to get engineered that would come back and be brought back into my body when they open up a book and had a meeting with us and they said here's what this is all about I'm skipping because I'm listening to him but I'm looking on here and I see the bullets that said this thing can cause death I closed the book I did I closed the book and I don't want to read it but I knew we had already gone through step one step two step three step four now we're step five they're going to come in and give me another thing they gave me a shot of radiation because all the other things that stopped had failed and this big it has started to diminish and we were praising God for it but then he says like wamo you know you hit that little popup head it goes down but it pops up over there and you you hit it over here and it pops up over there and that's kind of respon cancer was doing a number of CAT scans where they introduce fluid that lights up everything on the inside so they can see what they're looking for back in January this thing that we could see with black against a white background and it was so large that it was down under here that we couldn't see it had pushed nodes that was swollen about about the size of a tangerine under my armpit here up under my shoulder back here under my left knee behind the leg there was another that was about that size and I saw this thing is moving and moving moving my right eye was now pushing out of the socket I see you clearly the voice of God is saying to you I see you clearly amen I know where you live he alone is able to make all things work together am for the good of those who love him I'm laying up in the hospital MUSC and I said God you've allowed me to make history in the Philippines you've allowed us to smuggle Bibles into China you've allowed us to minister to those in Romania Bulgaria South Sudan walking among 26,000 refugees and stretching out my hand and praying for them because in that camp on the same ground that they slept on there's animals running around and there's feces and there's human sickness and there's extreme 115 degree temperature and you got several families living on the one tent roof overcrowded I've done all that and I've never been hospital all my life Wow but here we are I visited others in the hospital I prayed for others in the hospital but I'd never on my own account been hospitalized and here I am on my 68th birthday getting birthday balloons from my family and cards and chemo but God but God did you hear meall but God hallelujah amen there was a night it was a horrible night I could tell you each little detail G gory details about the different chapters of this sickness and the doctors that would say your headaches that had you crying out like a baby were worse than the worst migrain headache my bladder was so messed up I had two inserted in my back one hanging on either side that was collecting my urine that had to be emptied every day yeah they say you'll lose your your hair I lost it all I didn't even have eyebrows Brothers all the way down to my feet I mean you know you ladies that might take the razor I didn't have to take the razor I didn't have to shave any longer a kind of I don't have to shave but I'm looking in the mirror and I'm thinking oh my gosh I see this little raised skin up here where eyebrows were usually there but there's no there's no hair I looked kind of freakish now when I'm used to I lost 60 lbs wow and at one night after a horrible night of being awaken and awaken and awaken because constantly they were coming into my room I had a visit from my second oldest son and his family he came in with a question Dad how you doing I I'm I'm doing pretty good right now right now he said joh you rest last night and I said I'm glad you asked I get to tell somebody last night Josh I said I'm so used to hear him him come in and getting interrupted right the time I'm closing my eyes and sleep is coming over me and then there's somebody waking me up I said but I I I felt this Presence at the door and I look over to my right the lights were low but I saw a shadow and I thought here they come again but the holy spirit quickened in my spirit there's not one of them and I I stiffened because I knew it was the angel of death it you can't come in here and I said it twice and I turned my way away from that and I looked over to the dark side of the room but it wasn't dark because it wasum at by a presence I it and my thought it has to be and then I was interrupted in my thoughts by these words I'm not going anywhere wow and I reached out and grasped and I said I'm not letting you go and I held onise God praise the Lord I I I just have to share this I wrote it down so I make sure I said it right my son is ining good night he was at the house sending me a message I wrote it down so I could read it to you because it was on my heart to to share this and then I want to ask Mary to come up as a Christian believer our ministry should be an honest and a proven one I hope your walk with the Lord is as an honest one and a proven one there should be no doubt as to our commitment to God our walk with God should be such that if our message of glad tidings be hidden it's only hidden to those that are sinners good right those that are lost our Creator God knows of our trial our our frail nature and it's intended that we take no credit for the greatness of his saving power we may find ourselves pressed on every side perplexed persecuted and struck down but we are not crushed we are not driven to despair we are not deserted and are not nor will we ever be destroyed from The Book of Romans 5 veres 1 to3 1 2 and and three therefore since we have been justified by faith we have peace with God Amen through our Lord Jesus Christ through him we have also obtained access by faith and to this grace in which we stand and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God not only that but we rejoice in our sufferings knowing that our suffering produces wife tribulation tribulations produce patience patience patience produces character character produces okay you don't have that up there I'm sorry the character produces hope and the word of God says hope does not put us to shame amen amen because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us and there are things that I I can recall but there was such a great period a gray gray horrible gray period during this whole episode this whole Journey that I could not at the announcement they would come in and say because they were checking for neurotoxicity they would come in and insert a needle into my back that was about that long and they tell me I'm going to feel a little nudge and I felt more a great More Than A little nudge I felt an extreme pain but I did it five times they want to make sure that the cancer that was showing up on the scan uh pull a picture if you will picture number one who has the control I got it back there I don't know if you have it where it says number one I saw Travis when they were at my home today asking what order I wanted they shared in not number one picture yeah yeah that one looks okay so you can see on the right side of the neck this huge growth well you heard me talk about that go to the next one that was after they cut and taken a couple of biopsies and the wounds were trying to heal but I couldn't I couldn't keep my head straight I couldn't turn it to the right because of the pressure of this thing was so intense so intense it it kept me from turning to the right and at night time I couldn't lay my head over on my left side because I'm pulling against this thing and I'm learning to sleep in a different pattern because this is the only comfortable spot and if I turn it was Awakening me with extense just intense pain and go to the next one there's another view after I started losing almost all hair taking selfies and then go to the next one please that large growth on the side of my neck would be uppermost one I didn't know but the scan showed the cancer was up into the back of both eyes which now I know this is why my eyes are constantly running tears and Mary said you're okay cuz your eyes are all red puffy it was a cancer that was up in there wow brother thank you anyway all the black that you see on that skin on that white background was cancer so when they told us that it was spreading quickly it was very aggressive and my organs that are not very clearly visible you couldn't see them because they were hidden they were masked by the cancer the Bible teaches that the prayers of the righteous I'm I'm waiting for you Avail is much now he didn't say a little much I thank God that there are those of you who in this body stood with us as Watchmen on the wall amen cuz I heard about your prayers my response to people as I would say to you don't quit because we were on The Winning Side I've heard Pastor talk about that praise to God that you're on the winning side we were on The Winning Side God was proving himself faithful the Bible teaches that he watches over his word to perform it in our lives he didn't say wait till you're gone then I I'll show you what you missed out on or I'll show the devil and shake my fist at him uhuh you thought you want but God allows us to experience his miraculous healing power amen amen thank you for a testimony but I had to endure the test sometimes we are taken and we are shown the struggle sometimes he takes us through the struggle and sometimes we have to have that attitude of Shadrach mesach and abendigo where we say no matter no matter what and because I said and I fed myself and Mary who was there at my side every time I open my eyes in a glimour of hope she was there I could not even respond to the staff the medical staff who said tell me your name and date of birth I'm 68 years old now I can't tell you my first and last name I couldn't tell you as a teacher been teaching for years I could not count from 100 to Zero by 10 backwards I'm looking at my wife my eyes pleading I'm tearing I'm looking at her pleading silently help me I'm embarrassed I can't I couldn't move couldn't raise my arm couldn't get off my bed I showed Travis and Pastor M Matt picture where they had wires on both Sid of the head with patches monitoring Mary says it it looked because these wires were feeding information to a machine that people were monitoring and they were looking for neurotoxicity and looking to see if any neurological stuff was affected by the cancer and and and it put me in ICU for how long a week um I was in a desperate place but your prayers Avail it much your prayers availeth much your prayers ath much praise the Lord amen and it's because of your prayers and the prayers of the righteous added to yours because God had given us opportunity to smuggle bies into China we had people all over the world praying for us here in Buford and God was faithful because he heard your prayers thank and then he decided on our last Cat Skin a little over two weeks ago about three weeks ago when I was up for my last visit and we were to go back in December for another because they're monitoring and monitoring but on the last three weeks ago they always have a little session with us after the scan and Mary asked how about come on up I don't want to tell her part and she has such a great part you you all just to love on her she comes up well they came out and said uh I want I said I want to see the scan they said there's nothing to see wow I said that's what I want to see the nothing I want to see the nothing and so do he have a picture that yeah yeah so this is this is this dark hard his brain and his heart heart I do have a brain and his his uh lungs and his bladder and there's not even not even a speck of L and my bladder yeah yeah lungs sorry and um Dr hes his oncologist came in and he said Marcus I didn't want to tell you this before but you had the worst case of non Hotchkins lyoma I've ever seen wow and he said I I really didn't expect this good an outcome and we said you know we've been trusting you but we really trust the great physician and we've been praying for you and the staff but we know God's the one that healed them because he had one type he had two subtypes of non Hotchkins Lymphoma one of which they said said was incurable they said there was treatment for it but there was no cure and God said got the last say so he he said he said I'm the Cure I'm the Cure so we are grateful to talk about job we're grateful for the prayers thank you thank you I heard Pastor talk about job and everything that happens to us as Believers is God filtered he allows us right well he allows the enemy an opportunity because he knows our faith walk in him with him if you are faithful he is faithful even more so he will allow you to go through the trial so you can have a testimony he may allow you to endure hardships he may attack your he may allow the enemy to attack your family I talked yesterday to my barber the other Barber into my barber shop the guy who was a guy who lost his father out in Dale 81 year old who was wandering
