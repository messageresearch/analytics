[46:45] the last few weeks i've been dealing
[46:47] with a few different topics
[46:50] and kind of a few things are coming
[46:53] together
[46:54] and i want to look at what is freedom
[46:58] and um
[46:59] also looking at what satan offers to
[47:02] the world which is self-autonomy
[47:06] so just want to talk about that and
[47:07] define that a little bit
[47:09] the first scripture we have if you want
[47:11] to bring up that powerpoint for the
[47:12] jackson
[47:14] is in genesis chapter 3.
[47:24] and we're going to read one through five
[47:28] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[47:30] beast of the field which the lord god
[47:32] had made
[47:33] and he said unto the woman yea hath god
[47:36] said
[47:37] you shall not eat of every tree of the
[47:40] garden
[47:41] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[47:43] may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[47:45] garden
[47:46] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[47:48] the midst of the garden god has said you
[47:50] shall not eat of it
[47:52] neither shall you touch it
[47:54] lest ye die
[47:56] and the serpent said unto the woman you
[47:59] shall not surely die
[48:01] for god knows that when you eat of it
[48:04] your eyes will be opened and you will be
[48:06] like god
[48:08] knowing good and evil
[48:10] amen let's pray
[48:11] gracious heavenly father we come before
[48:13] you and yet we ask that your holy spirit
[48:15] would just move amongst us tonight lord
[48:17] come upon your word by your spirit lord
[48:20] and
[48:21] and may it come and penetrate into our
[48:23] hearts father may it bring transforming
[48:26] power lord as it's brought forth lord
[48:27] help me to step myself out of the way
[48:30] lord help each one here
[48:32] lay the cares of the of the day and of
[48:35] life to the side and and come to you
[48:37] lord
[48:38] ready to receive pulling on the word we
[48:40] ask father in jesus christ's name
[48:43] amen god bless you can be seated
[48:48] i usually don't take my jacket off but
[48:50] i have no choice tonight
[48:56] so you're going to see there
[48:57] on that slide
[49:00] that i have the uh esv there so if you
[49:03] notice in your in the king james version
[49:06] um it says you shall be as gods
[49:10] that word there is just elohim
[49:12] okay that's the word that's translated
[49:16] in the the top verse for god knows for
[49:19] elohim knows
[49:20] in the beginning god
[49:22] created the heavens and the earth elohim
[49:24] it's not a plural word it's a singular
[49:28] of majesty
[49:30] so when when this is spoken here you
[49:32] will be like gods of course it's it's
[49:35] it's acknowledging that adam and eve are
[49:38] distinct from each other but the reality
[49:40] is satan's not offering them to be
[49:42] a part of a pantheon of gods
[49:45] he's offering he's telling them you'll
[49:47] be
[49:48] like
[49:49] god like elohim like
[49:52] the creator knowing
[49:54] good and evil
[49:56] right so
[49:57] what is satan offering them actually
[49:59] he's offering them to be under his
[50:02] lordship
[50:04] under his dominion that's what he's
[50:06] offering but he doesn't come out and say
[50:08] it that way
[50:09] because they of course would say well
[50:10] god created us we owe our honor to god
[50:13] so in order to get
[50:15] adam and eve under his dominion under
[50:18] his authority he offers them a ruse
[50:21] what's that ruse it's a very religious
[50:23] one
[50:24] it's not anti-god
[50:26] it's actually saying well god's actually
[50:29] withholding something from you and i'm
[50:31] gonna bring you the revelation
[50:34] i'm gonna bring you a new revelation
[50:36] here so that you'll have a greater
[50:38] understanding to know good and evil and
[50:41] you'll be just
[50:42] like god
[50:47] they already were like god
[50:50] right
[50:51] they were made in the image and likeness
[50:53] of god they couldn't get any more like
[50:56] god
[50:57] than they already were
[50:59] god created them god had a perp had a
[51:02] purpose for them
[51:04] and god wanted to wants to fulfill
[51:07] his purpose and his plan
[51:09] through them
[51:11] and if they
[51:13] stay in that condition
[51:15] they're actually living in freedom
[51:18] perfect freedom they're not they're not
[51:20] in under bondage they're not under a
[51:22] spirit of bondage they're actually
[51:25] free so what is satan offering them
[51:28] adam and eve
[51:30] he's offering them the ability to govern
[51:33] themselves
[51:35] not to do it the way god said to do it
[51:38] come and do this
[51:40] the way you would like to do it
[51:42] but the funny thing is it actually
[51:43] really isn't self-autonomy at all it it
[51:46] looks like that's what it is but that's
[51:48] not what it is at all he is injecting
[51:51] his word
[51:53] into the mind of adam or of eve and then
[51:57] ultimately to adam and then into the
[51:58] rest of the human race
[52:00] why so when they receive his word they
[52:02] come under his authority under his
[52:05] headship
[52:07] when you when you receive the word of
[52:09] god
[52:10] believe it except that you're under the
[52:12] headship of the word
[52:13] when you receive the word of the enemy
[52:15] whose headship are you under you're
[52:18] under the headship of the enemy
[52:21] uh next verse i want to look at satan
[52:24] deceived his own self
[52:27] isaiah 14 12 says how
[52:30] art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer
[52:33] son of the morning
[52:34] how art thou cut down to the ground
[52:37] which did weaken
[52:39] the nations for thou has said in thine
[52:41] heart i will ascend into heaven so
[52:43] that's the first sin i will
[52:46] pride
[52:47] pride he wanted to do what he wanted to
[52:50] do not what god had created him for can
[52:54] you imagine just think about it for a
[52:55] second once again what a deceiver the
[52:58] people that were god's vice regents on
[53:01] earth
[53:02] ruling in god's place on earth
[53:05] he takes him and says you're going to be
[53:06] more like god
[53:08] what did he do to himself
[53:09] he said the same thing to himself
[53:11] you're going to be more like god i will
[53:13] ascend into heaven
[53:15] you already were
[53:17] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[53:19] of god no he wasn't to do that
[53:21] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[53:23] congregation in the sides of the north
[53:25] brother branham tells us we understand
[53:27] satan is not omniscient omnipotent
[53:29] omnipresent but brother branham says as
[53:31] far as authority he was co-equal with
[53:33] god
[53:35] that means authority does it doesn't
[53:37] mean
[53:38] satan was somehow co-god or some kind of
[53:41] thing no
[53:42] he had the the authority of god in him
[53:46] and it was operating through him and it
[53:48] just wasn't enough
[53:50] and he came to adam and eve with the
[53:52] same very same
[53:54] thing you have this position you have
[53:57] this place you're he's a son of god
[54:00] you're a daughter of god but i that's
[54:02] not enough god's withholding something
[54:04] there's more to it than that right and
[54:08] instead of submitting to what god wanted
[54:12] they went satan's way
[54:14] and again
[54:15] the the offer is
[54:17] self-autonomy you can
[54:19] the word autonomy means to govern
[54:21] yourself
[54:23] you admit you're a law unto yourself you
[54:26] make your own rules you make your own
[54:27] laws that's what satan wanted for
[54:30] himself
[54:31] and that's the offer that he makes to
[54:33] everyone
[54:35] verse 14 i will ascend above the heights
[54:37] of the clouds
[54:38] i will be like the most high
[54:42] well
[54:43] i mean he was co-equal with god
[54:48] i see the deception
[54:50] satan comes to us and tempts us and
[54:51] deceives us with
[54:53] things that we actually
[54:55] have and have in a better way
[54:57] because that was the very way he
[54:59] deceived his own self
[55:03] all right
[55:05] so
[55:08] what is what what is our world today
[55:11] think about that for a second
[55:13] our world today is self-governing
[55:18] it's autonomous
[55:21] look at the fruits
[55:23] of a world
[55:24] that is autonomous
[55:26] that's self-governing no
[55:29] they're not under the dominion of god
[55:31] they're not under they're under the
[55:32] dominion of satan and satan's offer was
[55:35] you can govern yourself you can make
[55:37] your own laws and that's exactly what
[55:39] the world is doing
[55:40] it's making their own laws and what's
[55:42] the result
[55:43] is it a happy place to be
[55:47] is it getting better all the time more
[55:50] technology we have
[55:52] man the more
[55:53] ascended we are as individuals and the
[55:56] more peaceful we are with one another
[55:58] and the better nations get along with
[56:00] each other right
[56:02] that's exactly what's happening on earth
[56:04] right now that's exactly what's not
[56:06] happening on earth right now
[56:09] that's the fruit of self governance
[56:12] that's the fruit of self
[56:14] autonomy
[56:15] do you is that what we want as
[56:17] individuals we don't want it as as
[56:21] members of a society we it doesn't it
[56:24] hasn't worked
[56:25] it doesn't work
[56:27] it's failed and it's continuing to fail
[56:30] and it's to the it's to the level of the
[56:32] whole world is in a place of crumbling
[56:37] and it's a mess
[56:38] and it's getting less and less happy
[56:41] the more connected we are through
[56:43] devices
[56:45] the higher rates of depression and
[56:47] suicide worldwide
[56:50] and this is the offer that satan is
[56:52] making to everyone
[56:55] i'm going to say he tries to make it to
[56:57] us as believers all the time
[56:59] but especially he makes it to
[57:01] young people who are going through
[57:04] adolescence who are going through a
[57:05] change in life who are coming to a place
[57:07] where now they need to move into a place
[57:10] of being more independent that's a
[57:12] process that takes place over time
[57:15] hormones kick in in our bodies and all
[57:18] of a sudden mom and dad are weirdos and
[57:20] don't know what they're talking about
[57:23] and
[57:28] but that's
[57:30] part of god's way of getting us to grow
[57:32] up and to go out and
[57:34] and become
[57:36] individuals
[57:37] that can be
[57:39] a part of the body of christ and can can
[57:41] be in connection personally with god
[57:44] himself and be useful
[57:46] in the hand of god
[57:48] uh in the body of christ
[57:51] but i think the thing that the devil
[57:52] does he knows that this time of
[57:54] adolescence
[57:56] is such a danger is such a a good time
[57:58] for him to work
[58:01] because there is an easy deception that
[58:04] takes place is i want independence from
[58:07] my parents
[58:08] satan says
[58:10] independence
[58:12] i'll get them
[58:13] you want to you want to be autonomous
[58:15] you want to be self-governing
[58:18] i have a great offer for you i have 100
[58:21] offers for you to become self-governing
[58:24] and become autonomous
[58:26] but it isn't god's way
[58:28] god has never called a single person in
[58:31] the history of the earth to be
[58:33] autonomous
[58:35] he's called him to freedom and liberty
[58:37] and that's the that's the ruse that the
[58:39] devil has i want my freedoms you get to
[58:42] become a teenager i want my freedoms i
[58:43] want my liberty you're in bondage to sin
[58:46] if you don't have the holy ghost you're
[58:48] in bondage to sin what are you going to
[58:49] get liberty you're just going to get
[58:51] more bondage
[58:53] unless you surrender your life to the
[58:55] lord and you get the holy ghost you're
[58:57] living in bondage you're born with that
[58:59] condition
[59:00] until you get the holy ghost you stay in
[59:02] that condition so when you get to that
[59:04] time and if you don't have the holy
[59:05] ghost say i promise you
[59:07] satan is going to offer you
[59:09] you can now
[59:11] govern yourself you're getting older
[59:13] now take your own authority take your
[59:15] own place do what you want to do i want
[59:18] to ask you a question where in the world
[59:20] does that thinking come from
[59:23] does it come from god
[59:27] it certainly doesn't come from god it
[59:29] comes it's a it's a deception
[59:31] from the devil
[59:34] we are as christians we are all we're to
[59:37] always be under the leadership of the
[59:38] holy spirit we're to be led by him we're
[59:43] not to follow what we want to do
[59:46] don't get that out of your heads young
[59:47] people i want to do what i want to do
[59:49] what
[59:51] okay devil
[59:53] i'm not calling you a devil young person
[59:55] i'm calling that devil that's speaking
[59:57] to you a
[59:58] devil recognize it for what it is
[1:00:02] and don't give in but fight
[1:00:05] what does the devil say and what do we
[1:00:07] see everywhere follow your heart if you
[1:00:09] would just follow your heart everything
[1:00:11] would be fine
[1:00:13] oh my goodness
[1:00:14] what a what a nonsense
[1:00:17] you're born with a sinful nature if you
[1:00:18] follow your heart what are you going to
[1:00:20] do
[1:00:20] sin upon sin
[1:00:22] more and more and more sin
[1:00:27] but satan says decide for yourself
[1:00:30] go your own way go after your own heart
[1:00:33] then you'll find fulfillment when you do
[1:00:35] that
[1:00:36] you won't
[1:00:38] the people that have risen to the
[1:00:40] greatest heights of quote-unquote
[1:00:42] worldly fulfillment
[1:00:43] are extremely dissatisfied
[1:00:46] are using drugs and and alcohol to to
[1:00:50] drown out the pain
[1:00:52] that they have that's gnawing in their
[1:00:54] minds and in their hearts
[1:00:56] that's what satan offers that's the
[1:00:58] crown of satan is someone drowning out
[1:01:01] their pain with alcohol and drugs
[1:01:05] that's not that's not what god is
[1:01:06] calling us to young people
[1:01:09] that's not what god is god is offering
[1:01:11] you freedom
[1:01:12] freedom from captivity freedom from
[1:01:15] bondage to sin
[1:01:17] numbers 15 39 says and it shall be unto
[1:01:20] you for a fringe
[1:01:21] that you may look upon it and remember
[1:01:24] all the commandments of the lord and do
[1:01:25] them and that you seek not after your
[1:01:28] own heart and your own eyes after which
[1:01:31] you used to go a whoring
[1:01:34] my goodness
[1:01:35] the lord really cuts to the chase in
[1:01:37] that statement
[1:01:38] he says you're you're you're playing the
[1:01:41] prostitute
[1:01:42] against me you're committing adultery
[1:01:43] against me because you're going after
[1:01:45] your own heart and your own eyes
[1:01:48] we're not to do that
[1:01:50] as believers we there's one person that
[1:01:52] we follow and that's the lord jesus
[1:01:54] christ
[1:01:55] and we're to be led by the spirit
[1:01:58] not our own hearts not our own eyes
[1:02:03] proverbs 28 26 he that trusts in his own
[1:02:07] heart is a fool
[1:02:10] but whoso walketh wisely he shall be
[1:02:13] delivered
[1:02:14] if you walk in wisdom what is wisdom
[1:02:17] the fear of the lord is the beginning of
[1:02:19] wisdom
[1:02:20] that's the foundation of wisdom so if
[1:02:22] you want to have be wise
[1:02:24] that's where you start
[1:02:26] but if you trust your own heart
[1:02:28] god says you're an idiot
[1:02:32] you're a fool you can't we don't know
[1:02:35] the future we don't know what we don't
[1:02:37] even know what's going to happen
[1:02:38] tomorrow we don't know the results of of
[1:02:40] any choices that we make but we do know
[1:02:43] if we follow god
[1:02:45] he's going to be there for us he's going
[1:02:47] to provide for us
[1:02:48] we may go through growth go through many
[1:02:50] trials
[1:02:51] many difficulties but he'll deliver us
[1:02:53] out of them all
[1:02:57] so don't be a fool
[1:03:00] don't be an idiot
[1:03:03] don't trust in your own heart
[1:03:06] it's it's a huge mistake
[1:03:11] why is it a huge mistake familiar verse
[1:03:14] jeremiah 17 9 the heart is deceitful
[1:03:17] above all things and desperately wicked
[1:03:19] who can know it
[1:03:21] that's the condition that we're born
[1:03:23] with that's not just really bad people
[1:03:25] that's not adolf hitler that's just
[1:03:27] adolf hitler that's not me i'm good
[1:03:30] i'm by nature good
[1:03:33] you're just you're once again you're
[1:03:35] deceiving your own self
[1:03:38] your heart you're born with a condition
[1:03:40] of heart and it's a bad condition of
[1:03:42] heart
[1:03:44] it's called
[1:03:46] desperately wicked
[1:03:48] and the depths of our wickedness and our
[1:03:50] own sinfulness the bible says who can
[1:03:53] know it in other words it's it's it's so
[1:03:55] great and so we can stoop a human being
[1:03:58] can soup so far
[1:04:00] in evil that it's it's almost impossible
[1:04:02] to go to the depths
[1:04:04] of that
[1:04:06] and i believe this is the this is the
[1:04:08] satanic deception in every age we talk
[1:04:11] about satan's eden it's the most
[1:04:13] deceiving age that's absolutely true but
[1:04:15] satan's tactic is similar in every age
[1:04:18] and that's that is
[1:04:20] govern your own self
[1:04:22] you can be self autonomous you can make
[1:04:24] your own ways you can make up your own
[1:04:25] rules follow after your own heart after
[1:04:28] your own mind
[1:04:30] and everything will be fine
[1:04:33] do whatever you think will work
[1:04:38] satan wants to work
[1:04:40] in our minds
[1:04:42] that's the place
[1:04:44] that he's constantly planting thoughts
[1:04:46] planting ideas he does that whether
[1:04:48] you're born again or not
[1:04:51] he's always working to plant
[1:04:54] seeds in your mind
[1:04:57] because he wants he wants to deceive you
[1:04:59] and he wants to destroy your life and he
[1:05:01] wants you to use you to harm and
[1:05:04] manipulate other people
[1:05:07] we we have to recognize that that is
[1:05:10] where the devil works
[1:05:12] young people
[1:05:13] don't forget that
[1:05:15] satan is going to work on your mind
[1:05:18] and you have to have your you have to
[1:05:19] guard you have to have a guard up you
[1:05:21] can't just accept every thought that
[1:05:23] comes in your head
[1:05:24] you have to you have to judge it by the
[1:05:26] word
[1:05:27] is this a scriptural thought
[1:05:29] is this a right thing is this a right
[1:05:31] approach this is the right attitude
[1:05:36] satan
[1:05:38] will work in the mind to tell you to go
[1:05:40] after your own heart your own your own
[1:05:42] desires make up your own rules
[1:05:45] that's his first avenue that's where he
[1:05:47] starts at then what is he going to do
[1:05:49] he's going to take he he has a design
[1:05:52] for you
[1:05:53] that's your destruction
[1:05:55] that's your destruction so if you if you
[1:05:58] realize when satan has taken you in a
[1:06:00] certain way
[1:06:02] in a heart of rebellion
[1:06:05] there there is an end to that
[1:06:07] you know and there is there's a lot of
[1:06:09] different avenues
[1:06:10] satan will take you satan will take you
[1:06:13] he'll put put a friend i mean i have my
[1:06:15] own experience
[1:06:17] 18 years old
[1:06:18] i was going to high school and i
[1:06:21] i always had sports kind of to stop me
[1:06:23] from
[1:06:24] wanting to become ineligible by
[1:06:27] smoking marijuana or getting caught at a
[1:06:29] party so i never would go but then i
[1:06:30] quit i quit baseball my senior year in
[1:06:34] the springtime i started hanging out
[1:06:36] with
[1:06:36] some
[1:06:40] not very good kids let's just put it
[1:06:41] that way
[1:06:42] after school that weren't involved in
[1:06:45] sports before i would have been
[1:06:46] constantly playing baseball and involved
[1:06:49] in that and
[1:06:50] not getting in trouble but now i was
[1:06:52] able to have time to get in trouble
[1:06:55] and this one kid he's he told me i'm
[1:06:58] going to get you to smoke weed
[1:07:02] no no i'm not gonna
[1:07:04] but i kept hanging out with him i kept
[1:07:06] there and he kept
[1:07:08] chattering at me i'm gonna get you to
[1:07:10] drink i'm gonna get you to smoke weed no
[1:07:12] i ain't i'm not gonna do that
[1:07:14] i should have been like this guy's not
[1:07:16] my friend
[1:07:19] this guy this guy's trouble i'm never
[1:07:21] gonna be around this guy again
[1:07:23] instead i just kept hanging out with him
[1:07:25] because he was friends with another guy
[1:07:27] that i like that never was bothering me
[1:07:28] but i didn't realize the danger i was in
[1:07:31] and so after a month of this
[1:07:34] chattering at me finally i said sure
[1:07:36] i'll smoke some weed
[1:07:38] and
[1:07:39] did was doing that was partying and
[1:07:41] drinking
[1:07:42] going completely the wrong way but what
[1:07:44] did it start with it started with the
[1:07:45] decision to listen
[1:07:48] it started with the decision not to cut
[1:07:50] that nonsense off
[1:07:53] and that's how the devil works what does
[1:07:55] he have he's going to take you down a
[1:07:57] road he has a path for you and he wants
[1:07:59] to increase that path increase that path
[1:08:02] he's going to take you into
[1:08:04] all kinds of
[1:08:06] wrong directions
[1:08:09] whether it be you know when you go into
[1:08:11] that drug and partying scene maybe
[1:08:13] you're gonna
[1:08:14] next you'll be robbing places
[1:08:17] trying to stealing from people
[1:08:20] you'll be maybe
[1:08:22] defiling yourself sexually
[1:08:25] you know these are things
[1:08:27] sometimes satan even takes a more subtle
[1:08:29] approach he says well i can't get him by
[1:08:30] just offering him drugs he'll never do
[1:08:32] it
[1:08:33] so instead what i'm going to do is i'm
[1:08:34] going to offer him a pretty girl
[1:08:37] or a handsome boy but that one that
[1:08:39] doesn't believe the word of god
[1:08:41] might be might be a nominal christian
[1:08:43] but isn't it on fire for god we'll offer
[1:08:46] you that right
[1:08:48] because i know i can't deceive him if i
[1:08:49] can't go directly to
[1:08:51] drugs and alcohol and sex
[1:08:53] they'll never they grew up in church and
[1:08:55] their mom and dad are
[1:08:57] on them constantly
[1:08:59] and and watching them so i'm going to
[1:09:00] give them i'm going to give them
[1:09:01] something else i'm going to give them a
[1:09:02] girlfriend or i'm going to give them a
[1:09:03] boyfriend that doesn't believe or follow
[1:09:05] the word of god why because he wants to
[1:09:07] take you to the next level and then the
[1:09:09] next level and then the next level why
[1:09:12] because he doesn't want you to be a
[1:09:13] believer
[1:09:14] he doesn't want you to be living in
[1:09:17] surrender to the word of god he wants
[1:09:18] you to be a tool in his hands for
[1:09:21] destruction
[1:09:22] and death
[1:09:24] but he's he's subtle
[1:09:27] he's not going to he's not going to just
[1:09:28] throw the worst thing at you
[1:09:30] it's little by little
[1:09:32] by little by little
[1:09:35] but it starts in one place and that's
[1:09:37] that's the very the very foundation is
[1:09:40] do it your own way what did what did the
[1:09:42] devil come to jesus when he tempted him
[1:09:44] he said you're hungry you have you have
[1:09:46] a physical need now do what i tell you
[1:09:50] even if satan was right
[1:09:54] in the end of the day that jesus could
[1:09:55] speak
[1:09:56] and turn stones to bread that's
[1:09:58] absolutely true
[1:09:59] but jesus isn't going to do it the
[1:10:02] devil's way
[1:10:03] we're not to do it the devil's way we're
[1:10:05] not to follow the devil's program
[1:10:07] he didn't first come and say bow down
[1:10:09] and worship me he said first
[1:10:12] do this little thing my way
[1:10:14] then he said come and worship me that's
[1:10:17] just how the devil will work with you
[1:10:18] too he's not he's
[1:10:20] he knows
[1:10:22] demons follow you
[1:10:24] just like there's angels and camping
[1:10:26] about you to protect you that are
[1:10:28] assigned to you there's demons that
[1:10:30] follow you they watch you they
[1:10:32] manipulate you they mess with you
[1:10:34] and they plant thoughts in your mind and
[1:10:36] they try to create circumstances it's a
[1:10:39] war that we're in the middle of
[1:10:41] and we're just we're just walking along
[1:10:43] like nothing's happening everything's
[1:10:44] fine
[1:10:45] but there's a war over your soul
[1:10:50] you got to recognize young people all of
[1:10:52] us
[1:10:53] but young people i want to open your
[1:10:55] eyes there's a war going on over your
[1:10:57] soul
[1:10:58] and how does the war happen it's fought
[1:11:01] with words
[1:11:03] and where do those words get
[1:11:05] planted in
[1:11:06] silently in your mind
[1:11:09] and unless you're checking that with the
[1:11:12] word
[1:11:13] you're going to go down an avenue
[1:11:16] that you're not going to like
[1:11:17] that's not going to be good for you
[1:11:20] why don't you avoid that
[1:11:25] let's see here
[1:11:31] i'm gonna skip ahead a little bit
[1:11:35] no i'm not
[1:11:37] second corinthians
[1:11:39] 6 14
[1:11:43] be not unequally yoked together with
[1:11:46] unbelievers
[1:11:47] for what fellowship hath righteousness
[1:11:49] with unrighteousness and what communion
[1:11:51] hath light with darkness and what
[1:11:53] concord hath christ with belial or what
[1:11:55] part hath he that believeth
[1:11:58] with an infidel
[1:12:00] and what agreement has the temple of god
[1:12:02] with idols for you are the temple of the
[1:12:04] living god as god has said i will dwell
[1:12:06] in them and walk in them i'll be their
[1:12:09] god and they shall be my people
[1:12:11] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:12:14] be separate saith the lord and touch not
[1:12:16] the unclean thing and i will receive you
[1:12:19] and will be a father unto you and you
[1:12:21] shall be my sons and daughters saith the
[1:12:24] lord almighty our separation
[1:12:28] from the world and from the devil
[1:12:31] here is connected to him being dwelling
[1:12:34] in us
[1:12:36] and be us being his sons and daughters
[1:12:38] his sons and daughters
[1:12:40] who have him dwelling in them separate
[1:12:42] themselves from the world don't get it
[1:12:44] out of the order he comes and dwells in
[1:12:46] us and as a result
[1:12:48] we become separated what is that
[1:12:50] sanctification
[1:12:51] we're set apart for god
[1:12:54] so that first verse that we
[1:12:57] grabbed there
[1:12:59] do not be unequally yoked together
[1:13:02] with
[1:13:02] unbelievers so
[1:13:06] there this is like uh
[1:13:07] this is paul bringing a mystical
[1:13:10] interpretation
[1:13:11] of a scripture in the old testament
[1:13:14] so i'm going to grab that
[1:13:16] you shall not plow with an ox
[1:13:19] and an ass together
[1:13:22] so he's taking this verse and applying
[1:13:23] it spiritually
[1:13:25] to believers and unbelievers
[1:13:28] so
[1:13:30] an ox i guess would be a believer
[1:13:33] and a donkey
[1:13:34] would
[1:13:36] be an unbeliever
[1:13:38] so
[1:13:39] we're not supposed to plow together with
[1:13:41] unbelievers
[1:13:45] that doesn't mean we go out of the world
[1:13:46] and become monks
[1:13:48] what it means is we don't come into an
[1:13:52] equal
[1:13:53] fellowship
[1:13:54] what's an equal fellowship a business
[1:13:56] partnership is one thing
[1:13:59] another thing is a
[1:14:01] a relationship between a boy and a girl
[1:14:03] a man and a woman
[1:14:04] we keep those kinds of things separate
[1:14:07] even friendships are dangerous when you
[1:14:10] yoke together like this
[1:14:12] a friendship with an unbeliever is
[1:14:14] dangerous when you're yoked together
[1:14:16] like this
[1:14:18] let me let me tell a testimony
[1:14:20] my own experience
[1:14:22] when i was
[1:14:24] first saved
[1:14:27] man the lord changed my desires he
[1:14:28] changed my heart but there was a lot of
[1:14:31] things that i had in my life
[1:14:33] that needed to get cleansed off of me
[1:14:36] so
[1:14:36] i mean there was rap music there was
[1:14:39] drinking there was the friends that i
[1:14:42] had that were pushing me towards
[1:14:45] partying and drinking and so it was
[1:14:48] it was there was victory but then there
[1:14:50] was struggles and trials and
[1:14:53] difficulties
[1:14:54] by god's grace i never went back to
[1:14:56] smoking marijuana but i'd you know i
[1:14:58] would go because my i grew up with
[1:15:00] parents that would
[1:15:02] drink beer and
[1:15:03] wine every once in a while that were
[1:15:05] that are christians
[1:15:07] and so i thought well i can just do that
[1:15:08] well it wasn't working very well for me
[1:15:11] and
[1:15:12] so i needed to stop that but then
[1:15:15] i was struggling i remember going to a
[1:15:17] church service at a charismatic church
[1:15:22] and i was talking with my brother-in-law
[1:15:23] about this and
[1:15:25] these problems and the friends that were
[1:15:27] kind of dragging me down and and
[1:15:30] taking me backward in my walk with the
[1:15:31] lord and so he
[1:15:34] he just said well let's just pray and
[1:15:36] the lord will
[1:15:37] will help you and give you wisdom well
[1:15:38] the minister preached on this verse
[1:15:41] that night
[1:15:42] and he gave an exact um basically step
[1:15:45] by step this is how you apply this verse
[1:15:47] if you've you've just been changed the
[1:15:49] lord's transformed your life
[1:15:51] you need to be careful what friends that
[1:15:53] you're yoked together with
[1:15:55] and he said
[1:15:56] what you what you need to do is right
[1:15:58] now you're like this
[1:16:00] spiritually with those friends and
[1:16:02] they're just dragging you down to their
[1:16:03] level continually you need to change
[1:16:05] that situation
[1:16:07] to where you're leading spiritually in
[1:16:09] those friendships and it it was just a
[1:16:12] basically he he said make a
[1:16:14] confrontation with your friends do it in
[1:16:16] love but just say i want to be your
[1:16:18] friend.
[1:16:20] god has changed my life
[1:16:22] we've talked about it i'm different i
[1:16:24] have a different direction in my life
[1:16:27] and i want friends that help me
[1:16:30] in this direction of walking with christ
[1:16:34] and so i want you to be one of my
[1:16:36] friends
[1:16:37] that helps me in my walk with god
[1:16:40] so when it comes to parties and drinking
[1:16:43] and these things i don't want that in my
[1:16:44] life anymore so don't invite me
[1:16:47] and if someone invites me make sure
[1:16:50] don't let me go
[1:16:51] don't let me get involved in that
[1:16:54] and uh we can be friends we can continue
[1:16:56] to be friends but i need your help in
[1:16:57] that of course everybody said oh yeah
[1:17:00] absolutely i'll be your friend there's
[1:17:02] one person
[1:17:04] out of all those people that actually
[1:17:06] stayed in touch with me
[1:17:07] and helped me oh he you know he would
[1:17:09] say oh we're going everybody's going out
[1:17:11] to this oh yeah but i remember you not
[1:17:14] wanting to drink and and party and stuff
[1:17:16] so you better not go
[1:17:18] so it but it what what happened was okay
[1:17:21] i did lose friends
[1:17:23] i found out who my real friends were is
[1:17:24] actually what i did
[1:17:26] i found out who really cared about
[1:17:29] me
[1:17:30] and what i wanted in my life and so
[1:17:33] that one friend stuck by my side that's
[1:17:36] fine god provided other friends
[1:17:38] i had provide good godly friends friends
[1:17:41] that were on fire for the word of god
[1:17:43] and that just that atmosphere alone
[1:17:46] brought me
[1:17:47] just
[1:17:48] totally
[1:17:49] set me on a completely different
[1:17:50] trajectory in my life
[1:17:52] but you that that that changes it that
[1:17:55] friend now was not unequally yoke with
[1:17:57] me he wasn't dragging me down now it was
[1:18:00] he and i were friends but we weren't
[1:18:02] friends on the level that was putting me
[1:18:04] in a place of continual compromise
[1:18:08] and that's that's the dangerous place
[1:18:10] that happens with being unequally yoked
[1:18:12] together with unbelievers is now
[1:18:15] they're forcing you to compromise over
[1:18:17] and over and over and over and over
[1:18:20] again
[1:18:21] and you're sitting here oh man i don't
[1:18:23] want to do this what's going on and
[1:18:25] maybe you're frustrated with yourself
[1:18:26] and you keep going in the wrong
[1:18:27] direction it's because you're unequally
[1:18:29] yoked
[1:18:30] you've got to break that
[1:18:32] yoke i'm not saying you don't have to be
[1:18:33] friends we have we have to win people to
[1:18:35] christ but do it the right way
[1:18:38] you say well you know
[1:18:39] i want to get into relationships with
[1:18:41] them they'll be my girlfriend my
[1:18:42] boyfriend
[1:18:44] and then i'll win them to christ oh my
[1:18:47] do you know how ridiculous that is
[1:18:50] you know absurd
[1:18:52] that is that's like saying hey i'm gonna
[1:18:54] go and commit adultery with people with
[1:18:57] all kinds of peoples so that i can win
[1:18:59] them to christ i mean it's it's it's to
[1:19:01] that level of absurdity why is it absurd
[1:19:04] why is it why is it to that level of
[1:19:06] absurdity
[1:19:08] because
[1:19:09] you're you're basically saying i'm going
[1:19:10] to do evil
[1:19:12] so that good would come out of it
[1:19:15] that's not how it works
[1:19:17] you're not going to disobey god and say
[1:19:18] god bless me in my disobedience
[1:19:25] no you can win that you still win them
[1:19:26] to christ absolutely 100 that's true but
[1:19:30] you have to do it god's way
[1:19:32] and not your way your way it's just an
[1:19:34] excuse you don't really want to win them
[1:19:37] to christ you just want to be in that
[1:19:39] relationship
[1:19:41] that's what's most important to you
[1:19:42] that's the absolute and the ultimate to
[1:19:44] you
[1:19:45] if you want to win to christ then do it
[1:19:47] god's way which is
[1:19:48] come out from among them and be separate
[1:19:50] saith the lord and touch not the unclean
[1:19:53] thing what communion has light with
[1:19:54] darkness
[1:19:56] you have to separate then when you come
[1:19:57] to that level of separation
[1:20:00] now you can speak to them and talk to
[1:20:02] them and tell them
[1:20:03] about the about christ
[1:20:05] but not being you don't come and be
[1:20:08] unequally yoked together with an
[1:20:09] unbeliever and say let's
[1:20:12] let's
[1:20:13] bring you to christ
[1:20:15] because that
[1:20:16] it don't at 99.9
[1:20:18] of the time
[1:20:20] it doesn't work that way the reality is
[1:20:22] it goes the opposite direction is
[1:20:24] you get dragged down to be an unbeliever
[1:20:26] with them
[1:20:27] that's what usually happens i know
[1:20:29] there's exceptions to that
[1:20:32] but
[1:20:34] they're very rare and they're very few
[1:20:37] they're very far far between and
[1:20:39] ultimately it's playing with fire
[1:20:42] obey god first
[1:20:44] do what god wants and that's
[1:20:46] don't have an unbelieving boyfriend or
[1:20:48] girlfriend don't be on the same level
[1:20:51] exact same level with people that are
[1:20:53] unbelievers that they're influencing you
[1:20:55] to the world
[1:20:57] talk to them make it straight
[1:21:00] make it make your purpose known i mean i
[1:21:02] told my friends i want to win you to
[1:21:04] christ i want you to be exactly like me
[1:21:07] i want you to be changed like like i've
[1:21:08] been changed
[1:21:10] that's my purpose make your purpose
[1:21:12] known and then say let's go forward with
[1:21:14] that premise in our friendship
[1:21:17] otherwise you'll be dragged down it's
[1:21:18] just how it works
[1:21:30] yeah i mentioned this in reading that
[1:21:32] paul romans 3 8 says and not rather as
[1:21:34] we be slanderously reported and as some
[1:21:36] affirm that we say let us do evil
[1:21:39] that good may come whose damnation is
[1:21:42] just we don't violate the word of god in
[1:21:45] order to fulfill the word of god
[1:21:48] we just obey it
[1:21:50] and let god
[1:21:52] do it his way
[1:21:54] you know it's another way to put it is
[1:21:57] if you're disobeying the whole the god
[1:21:59] you can't say i'm being led by the
[1:22:01] spirit to disobey god
[1:22:03] it doesn't it doesn't follow
[1:22:06] you have to
[1:22:07] the holy spirit always directs you to be
[1:22:09] in the line and order of god's word
[1:22:17] satan wants you to have this great
[1:22:19] opportunity to govern yourself
[1:22:23] but he also knows he does that and he
[1:22:25] offers that to you what does he offer he
[1:22:27] offers freedom
[1:22:28] in many ways in i've seen in missionary
[1:22:31] work
[1:22:32] that people in oppressed countries
[1:22:36] they don't really want to come to christ
[1:22:38] because they want to be saved from their
[1:22:40] sins
[1:22:41] what they really want to experience is
[1:22:43] they want to go from being under an
[1:22:46] oppressive
[1:22:47] government
[1:22:48] where they can't do what they want to do
[1:22:51] to being free
[1:22:54] freedom in christ is what they want but
[1:22:56] their definition of freedom in christ is
[1:22:59] not freedom
[1:23:00] it's self autonomy
[1:23:03] it's i want to do what i want to do i
[1:23:05] want to be like the americans and drink
[1:23:06] smoke and commit adultery and still be a
[1:23:09] christian
[1:23:11] that's that's
[1:23:14] that's what this world is like that's
[1:23:15] what this worldly denominationalism is
[1:23:18] like
[1:23:19] but it's a deception it's not it's not
[1:23:22] transformation it's just changing it's
[1:23:25] just changing from one dead religion to
[1:23:27] another dead religion
[1:23:30] salvation is salvation from sin
[1:23:33] it's not just a new political
[1:23:34] affiliation
[1:23:39] so
[1:23:40] where are we at
[1:23:49] so satan
[1:23:50] not only offers something different than
[1:23:52] god
[1:23:53] so god is offering to us
[1:23:55] deliverance
[1:23:57] from captivity to be free
[1:24:00] satan is offering us self-autonomy to
[1:24:02] actually be under his
[1:24:04] control and dominion
[1:24:07] but
[1:24:08] god works differently as well
[1:24:10] satan works from the outside in
[1:24:14] god works from the inside
[1:24:18] out
[1:24:19] so
[1:24:21] brother branham says in abraham's cove
[1:24:23] covenant confirmed in the garden of eden
[1:24:26] the devil chose a part of a man and god
[1:24:28] chose a part god chose his heart
[1:24:31] the devil chose his intellects
[1:24:36] in looking at the unseen brother branham
[1:24:38] says when god made man he made him thus
[1:24:40] for he made him this little certain
[1:24:42] compartment in the man for his own
[1:24:44] throne his control tower
[1:24:47] god wants to lead man
[1:24:49] but man wants to lead himself
[1:24:52] therefore there is a war constantly
[1:24:56] the man wants to go after what he sees
[1:24:58] with his eyes
[1:24:59] that's where he's deceived
[1:25:01] that's where satan deceived eve by what
[1:25:03] she could see the fruit was pleasant to
[1:25:05] the eye but it was death to the soul
[1:25:08] so is it tonight god wants to lead man
[1:25:11] so he made himself a little control
[1:25:12] tower in the midst of his heart so that
[1:25:14] man would be led by the spirit of god
[1:25:17] getting off on his own leading is what
[1:25:20] separated from his
[1:25:22] fellowship i think that's just so
[1:25:24] profound brother branham puts those two
[1:25:27] things together god's
[1:25:28] program is working by the heart to lead
[1:25:31] the man he changes his heart and then he
[1:25:34] leads them from that control tower to
[1:25:36] control everything else
[1:25:38] satan is working on the intellect from
[1:25:40] the outside in to deceive and therefore
[1:25:43] control
[1:25:44] body soul and spirit the man
[1:25:47] i put together this little thing forgive
[1:25:49] me for my terrible artwork and graphic
[1:25:52] design
[1:25:53] lack of graphic design skills but
[1:25:57] there's the devil
[1:25:59] he's saying be free
[1:26:00] be happy
[1:26:02] follow your own heart
[1:26:04] but his words are
[1:26:06] actually dripping with blood because the
[1:26:09] purpose of the words
[1:26:10] are your death
[1:26:12] and he's coming from the outside
[1:26:14] in he wants you to be governed by
[1:26:18] see feel
[1:26:19] taste smell in here
[1:26:22] that outside
[1:26:24] then secondarily he comes to the mind
[1:26:27] right there
[1:26:28] comes to the mind in order to control
[1:26:31] see taste feel smell in here and control
[1:26:33] the body he comes to the mind and when
[1:26:35] he ultimately does that then the man is
[1:26:38] governed if you can see in the middle by
[1:26:40] unbelief
[1:26:42] the soul is governed by unbelief so the
[1:26:46] soul is the control tower right
[1:26:48] the soul is the nature
[1:26:50] of the spirit
[1:26:52] so when satan gets control he comes at
[1:26:55] it with deception from the outside
[1:26:58] working
[1:26:59] in
[1:27:00] okay
[1:27:01] so he does that
[1:27:02] he does that to
[1:27:05] unbelievers but here's a believer
[1:27:06] someone who has faith someone has the
[1:27:08] holy holy spirit satan still
[1:27:12] comes from the outside
[1:27:14] to deceive
[1:27:17] he still comes from the body
[1:27:20] to the mind to control the mind if he
[1:27:23] can control the mind then faith just
[1:27:26] gets bottled up and put in a little a
[1:27:28] little corner so it really can't operate
[1:27:31] it's just under the control and dominion
[1:27:33] of satan and a believer can get to that
[1:27:35] place
[1:27:37] they never lose their salvation
[1:27:39] but but in their in their
[1:27:42] in their
[1:27:43] experience
[1:27:45] faith is so weak
[1:27:47] it's in a corner that they're completely
[1:27:50] under that
[1:27:51] control and when that happens the whole
[1:27:54] focus
[1:27:55] becomes
[1:27:56] self
[1:27:58] and what what the devil is putting on
[1:28:00] the outside in what is how does the
[1:28:02] devil work again it's it's
[1:28:05] self-autonomy it's pride he works by
[1:28:07] pride
[1:28:08] and he wants to get he wants to use that
[1:28:11] to create unbelief
[1:28:13] in us
[1:28:16] but somehow the grace of god comes
[1:28:19] and there's something inside of you that
[1:28:21] says
[1:28:22] not my will
[1:28:24] not my will not what i want but yours be
[1:28:27] done blessed be the name of the lord
[1:28:31] the devil will continue to do that but
[1:28:33] he's going to come against us
[1:28:36] but faith will rise up in the believer
[1:28:39] god god will deliver you know i've been
[1:28:42] in that i've been in those places of
[1:28:44] those times where you just feel so down
[1:28:47] you so feel so hurt you feel broken you
[1:28:49] feel faith is not operating
[1:28:51] barely at all it's there
[1:28:54] the devil can never take that away it's
[1:28:56] there but yet it's it's so weak
[1:28:59] and we've got how do we battle the devil
[1:29:02] remember it's a war
[1:29:04] right
[1:29:05] and what how is it fought
[1:29:09] by words
[1:29:11] by words most powerful force
[1:29:14] in the universe the devil will come
[1:29:16] against you with words
[1:29:17] i remember brother bannon says he's
[1:29:19] actually just a bluff
[1:29:20] he doesn't actually have
[1:29:22] power over the believer the only power
[1:29:24] he has over the believer is if he
[1:29:26] actually
[1:29:28] lets him have power
[1:29:30] so if we if we just took the sword and
[1:29:32] fought
[1:29:33] we would never get to that position in
[1:29:35] place
[1:29:36] where our faith is weak back in the
[1:29:39] corner
[1:29:40] but instead instead
[1:29:43] by self-centeredness we get so focused
[1:29:45] on ourself
[1:29:47] that we don't see out we don't see out
[1:29:50] i've been there
[1:29:53] faith can't operate when the focus is on
[1:29:55] self
[1:29:56] but the word of god will come to you i
[1:29:58] mean god loves us he's not going to
[1:30:00] leave us
[1:30:01] in that condition
[1:30:03] he's going to give us strength then we
[1:30:05] can experience real freedom
[1:30:07] you know that's what the lord has come
[1:30:09] to do
[1:30:10] got to keep moving otherwise i'll never
[1:30:12] get my point across and everybody will
[1:30:14] sit here and sweat all night
[1:30:17] second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any
[1:30:19] man be in christ he's a new creature or
[1:30:21] a new creation old things are passed
[1:30:24] away behold
[1:30:25] all things are become
[1:30:28] new
[1:30:31] old things have completely passed away
[1:30:33] everything
[1:30:35] when you're born born of the spirit of
[1:30:36] god
[1:30:37] everything has become new
[1:30:39] you're completely changed you're a
[1:30:41] finished product and you're ready for
[1:30:42] the rapture
[1:30:48] well
[1:30:49] it's the truth
[1:30:51] all things are become new
[1:30:54] you are a new creation
[1:30:56] but
[1:30:57] there's a work that god is going to do
[1:30:59] and he has to start doing
[1:31:02] romans 12 1
[1:31:04] i believe this is a huge
[1:31:06] part of our sanctification
[1:31:10] it's self-surrender we
[1:31:12] our victory comes
[1:31:15] when we surrender ourself
[1:31:17] to the will of the lord
[1:31:19] when our passion our desire our entire
[1:31:22] purpose
[1:31:22] is to be in the perfect will of god
[1:31:25] what happens god is cleaning us in this
[1:31:28] process he's changing us and when our
[1:31:30] when we're with one mind seeking that
[1:31:33] the devil will come in with thoughts and
[1:31:34] try to get you off of that try to do
[1:31:36] things your own way
[1:31:38] he constantly does it to me so i know
[1:31:40] he's doing it to you too
[1:31:42] so
[1:31:43] we just fight
[1:31:45] we just stand our ground and fight with
[1:31:47] the truth
[1:31:49] and as you grow in faith what happens
[1:31:51] the deception from the devil gets even
[1:31:53] better
[1:31:55] and guess what happens it challenges you
[1:31:57] and you get stronger and you get
[1:31:59] stronger
[1:32:00] and then you get stronger again
[1:32:02] but i beseech you therefore brethren by
[1:32:04] the mercies of god that you present your
[1:32:07] bodies a living sacrifice
[1:32:09] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[1:32:12] reasonable reasonable service
[1:32:15] our whole body not just our soul
[1:32:17] not just our inner man
[1:32:19] but our whole being our bodies
[1:32:22] our inner man all of us
[1:32:25] we submit and surrender to the lord
[1:32:27] that's our self-surrender and he says
[1:32:29] that's our reasonable service
[1:32:32] we owe everything to him
[1:32:35] and be not conformed to this world but
[1:32:37] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:32:39] mind that you may prove what is that
[1:32:41] good and acceptable
[1:32:43] and perfect will of god so we are a new
[1:32:46] creature
[1:32:47] in christ when we're born of the spirit
[1:32:49] of god but there's a process that we
[1:32:51] have to go through
[1:32:53] there's a process of growth and
[1:32:55] transformation
[1:32:56] that we have to go through and it's
[1:32:58] definitely directly connected to our
[1:33:00] self-surrender
[1:33:02] before the lord the surrender of our
[1:33:04] will our purpose our plans to god's will
[1:33:07] so that we're simply
[1:33:09] every one of us we're simply a vessel
[1:33:12] that god can work through
[1:33:14] according to his purpose
[1:33:17] john 8 36 the son therefore shall make
[1:33:20] you free you shall be free indeed
[1:33:26] to be free means to be liberated
[1:33:28] so
[1:33:29] the pharisees understood correctly when
[1:33:31] they saw when they heard this verse and
[1:33:33] they got offended and said we've never
[1:33:34] been in bondage to anyone
[1:33:38] we've never been in bondage to anyone so
[1:33:42] someone that is set free means they've
[1:33:44] been in bondage
[1:33:46] that's the condition we're born in in
[1:33:48] bondage to sin that's why we need a new
[1:33:51] to be a new creation that's why we need
[1:33:53] to be changed
[1:33:55] is because we're in bondage to sin i
[1:33:58] mean i i think this is not just
[1:34:00] theological ideas guys
[1:34:03] this is not just doctrine this is not
[1:34:05] just words on the page
[1:34:06] we those of you that have kids you
[1:34:09] understand this
[1:34:10] that you're that they're born in sin and
[1:34:12] shaped in iniquity
[1:34:15] we love them we think they're perfect
[1:34:16] little angels before they start
[1:34:19] walking and talking and
[1:34:24] but it's all our experience we're not by
[1:34:26] nature good
[1:34:28] our heart isn't by nature good we're by
[1:34:30] nature evil
[1:34:32] we're by nature wicked and we're in
[1:34:34] bondage to sin we're born under
[1:34:37] this corruption of this world and we
[1:34:40] need to be set free
[1:34:45] says this is
[1:34:46] the pharisees just before those verses
[1:34:48] they answer him we be abraham's seed and
[1:34:50] we're never in bondage to any man how
[1:34:52] sayest though thou you shall be made
[1:34:55] free
[1:34:56] jesus answered them verily verily i say
[1:34:58] unto you whosoever commits sin
[1:35:00] is the servant of sin
[1:35:02] if you commit sin you're in bondage to
[1:35:04] sin
[1:35:06] you're in bondage to sin
[1:35:08] that is satan's program
[1:35:11] bondage to sin
[1:35:13] so when you're getting these thoughts of
[1:35:15] wanting to govern yourself and do it
[1:35:17] your own way
[1:35:19] what is that what is happening
[1:35:21] satan is trying to entrap you and keep
[1:35:23] you under bondage of sin
[1:35:28] don't go that direction don't be don't
[1:35:30] go that route
[1:35:32] bondage is the opposite of liberty you
[1:35:34] you think you have the illusion of
[1:35:36] freedom
[1:35:38] right
[1:35:39] we're born with this illusion that we
[1:35:41] have freedom but it's a delusion
[1:35:44] we aren't free
[1:35:46] we're we are captive you say i'm an
[1:35:49] american i'm free
[1:35:52] you're a captive
[1:35:54] to
[1:35:54] sin and you need to be set free and you
[1:35:57] can't set yourself free
[1:35:59] christ has to do it the son is the one
[1:36:01] that makes you free
[1:36:05] when you're seeking to do it your own
[1:36:08] way when you're seeking to govern
[1:36:10] yourself
[1:36:12] you're working under slavery
[1:36:14] you're actually an enslaved individual
[1:36:18] that's the reality
[1:36:19] if your heart is continually pushing you
[1:36:22] in that direction i want to do what i
[1:36:23] want to do i don't want to follow what
[1:36:25] my parents do i don't want to follow
[1:36:27] this direction i want to do it my own
[1:36:28] way just i'm a preacher told you right
[1:36:31] now
[1:36:32] you're under bondage
[1:36:35] to sin and you're actually enslaved to
[1:36:38] it no i'm not i'm free i'm
[1:36:40] okay
[1:36:42] go ahead
[1:36:44] find out the direction it'll take you
[1:36:49] you have to be set free by the power of
[1:36:51] god
[1:36:53] you have to be changed by the power of
[1:36:54] god
[1:36:56] you have to become you have to be
[1:36:58] liberated
[1:36:59] christ is the liberator you can't
[1:37:01] liberate yourself
[1:37:03] by making yourself further in bondage to
[1:37:06] sin
[1:37:07] well i just want to do what i want to do
[1:37:10] you just want to be further and further
[1:37:13] and further from god is what you're
[1:37:14] saying okay
[1:37:17] you you have that you have the freedom
[1:37:20] in under the the
[1:37:22] the constitution of the united states to
[1:37:24] be a captive to sin
[1:37:26] here go ahead
[1:37:29] but that's not freedom
[1:37:33] it's not freedom
[1:37:36] god's god's highest freedom is when we
[1:37:39] are fulfilling the purpose that god
[1:37:42] created us for
[1:37:44] god
[1:37:45] makes it so
[1:37:46] there's this direct connection to being
[1:37:49] in the middle of his will to being the
[1:37:52] most fulfilled
[1:37:54] we have an illusion that life is about
[1:37:57] being happy we want to be happy i just
[1:37:59] want those people to be happy happiness
[1:38:02] is fleeting
[1:38:04] happiness
[1:38:06] goes up and down and up and down
[1:38:09] the would you rather be happy or would
[1:38:11] you rather be feel
[1:38:13] fulfilled
[1:38:15] i think if you have any sense about you
[1:38:18] you would rather be fulfilled because
[1:38:20] that lasts whether you're happy or not
[1:38:23] and how do you feel fulfilled
[1:38:25] how do we get fulfilled in our lives by
[1:38:28] finding and walking in the purpose that
[1:38:31] god created you for
[1:38:34] when you are walking in god's perfect
[1:38:37] purpose
[1:38:38] that's the place where you experience
[1:38:40] the most freedom
[1:38:42] the most joy the most happiness the most
[1:38:45] peace
[1:38:46] outside of that outside of seeking and
[1:38:49] that's something that you seek after
[1:38:50] that's not something that you arrive at
[1:38:52] and just sit there
[1:38:53] that's something that you it says as
[1:38:56] many as our
[1:38:57] sitting
[1:38:59] in the presence of god or are sons of
[1:39:01] god no lead
[1:39:03] that's continual
[1:39:04] that's constant that never changes that
[1:39:07] never stops
[1:39:08] you will always be
[1:39:10] as long as you're alive in this
[1:39:12] dimension
[1:39:13] in this flesh
[1:39:14] it's necessary that you're following the
[1:39:16] leadership of the holy spirit
[1:39:18] that never stops and that never ends
[1:39:19] that's something that we're always
[1:39:22] aiming for and pushing for and and
[1:39:24] putting all of our
[1:39:26] efforts and strength in into is finding
[1:39:29] the mind of god
[1:39:31] walking in the mind of god and being
[1:39:33] sure that we're under his authority
[1:39:35] when we're in that place
[1:39:37] that's peace that's shalom
[1:39:40] that's fulfillment
[1:39:42] that's happiness
[1:39:44] happiness goes up and down
[1:39:47] sometimes you're sometimes you're happy
[1:39:49] sometimes you're sad sometimes there's
[1:39:51] tears sometimes there's tears of tears
[1:39:53] of sadness sometimes they're tears of
[1:39:54] joy and thankfulness
[1:39:56] that's all part of living in this
[1:39:59] sinful
[1:40:00] dead and dying world
[1:40:02] but there's there's coming a time if
[1:40:04] you're living in the liberty of the sons
[1:40:06] of god there's coming a time where he's
[1:40:08] going to wipe every tear away
[1:40:10] where there'll be no sorrow no sadness
[1:40:13] but if you're going to choose the
[1:40:15] devil's direction the devil's way that's
[1:40:18] not for you
[1:40:20] there's just continual tears waiting
[1:40:23] don't choose satan's way
[1:40:26] don't choose bondage to sin
[1:40:28] isn't it amazing that we want to fall
[1:40:31] that we want
[1:40:32] as we're growing as we're as we're as
[1:40:35] we're coming to the ages of maturity
[1:40:38] that we want to find our own way
[1:40:42] and that's that's fine in its own sense
[1:40:44] but really
[1:40:46] we don't want to find our own way we
[1:40:48] want to lose our own way you're looking
[1:40:51] at it the opposite direction i want to
[1:40:53] lose my own with all my heart i want to
[1:40:55] lose my own way
[1:40:58] i just want i want to be done with my
[1:41:01] own way i want to be done with my own
[1:41:03] thoughts
[1:41:04] i want to think god thoughts i want to
[1:41:07] be in the center of his will
[1:41:09] no matter what i don't want to follow my
[1:41:11] own ways my own ways make me
[1:41:14] frustrated and sad and upset
[1:41:17] god wants you to be free
[1:41:19] how can you be free you certainly can't
[1:41:21] do it by
[1:41:22] going after the nature that you have
[1:41:24] inside of you
[1:41:26] you have to do it by seeking after him
[1:41:28] with all your heart
[1:41:33] musicians if you'd come
[1:41:38] romans 8 15 for you have not
[1:41:41] received
[1:41:42] the spirit of bondage again to fear
[1:41:45] but you have received the spirit of
[1:41:47] adoption
[1:41:48] whereby we cry abba father
[1:41:52] so again the spirit there's a spirit of
[1:41:54] bondage and this there's a spirit of
[1:41:57] sonship
[1:41:58] a placing as sun placing in sunship the
[1:42:01] spirit of bondage what does it lead to
[1:42:04] fear
[1:42:05] again i just re replace all of this
[1:42:08] bondage is
[1:42:09] seeking after your own heart
[1:42:11] bondage is seeking after your own
[1:42:13] desires
[1:42:15] that's bondage
[1:42:16] we're born that way
[1:42:18] but we haven't as christians we haven't
[1:42:20] received that spirit we've received the
[1:42:22] spirit of placing as sons and sons are
[1:42:25] what they're led
[1:42:27] by the spirit of god amen
[1:42:32] romans 8 21 because the creation itself
[1:42:35] also
[1:42:36] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:42:39] corruption
[1:42:40] into the glorious liberty of the
[1:42:42] children of god
[1:42:43] amen thank god we
[1:42:45] actually are walking in liberty now
[1:42:48] by the spirit of god by his transforming
[1:42:51] power
[1:42:52] we've been delivered already from the
[1:42:54] bondage of corruption though this flesh
[1:42:56] is still under the bondage of corruption
[1:42:59] but the inner man
[1:43:00] is changed is transformed is renewed and
[1:43:04] is walking in glorious liberty
[1:43:07] but what is what is satan's way what is
[1:43:09] satan's purpose it's to keep people in
[1:43:12] the bondage of corruption
[1:43:14] and what is his offering to you
[1:43:16] you
[1:43:18] and what do you get when you choose you
[1:43:22] you get satan
[1:43:25] you get satan's ways satan's purpose the
[1:43:28] ways of the world and it leads
[1:43:30] to death it leads to corruption
