[Applause] [Music] glory to god don't just enjoy some worship tonight enjoy that just gonna open up our bibles tonight and turn to the book of hosea it's a bit loud over here um hosea chapter two hosea is found right after the book of the book of daniel hosea chapter 2 and verse 15 14 we'll start at verse 14. amen it says therefore behold i will allure her and bring her into the wilderness and speak comfortably unto her and i will give her vineyards from thence and the valley of acre for a door of hope and she shall she shall sing there as in the days of her youth and as in the days when she came up out of the land of egypt amen let's turn to one more scripture over in hebrews chapter 12 and verse 1 hebrews 12 and 1. it reads wherefore seeing we also are compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of god let's just bow our hearts tonight dear precious heavenly father lord we're thankful for your word tonight lord jesus father we're thankful for just gathering together in this church lord and this assembly lord with other looks of fire father god lord we're thankful for the worship lord the specials lord jesus just the singing lord jesus now father we're here for the most important part of worship lord jesus lord the ministering of your word lord jesus father i just submit myself unto you now father lord i pray that you lord i have these notes laid out before me lord i have labored but lord jesus none of it matters if you're not here lord jesus i submit myself completely unto you now lord i pray that you would anoint my words lord god anoint the ears to hear father god and let us just have lord jesus your holy spirit moving among us tonight lord jesus we invite you now father in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word did you take your seats so happy to be here tonight amen i come to church to be changed like all of us amen i know that when i sit on those pews and when i'm up here the lord is still molding me he's still molding our character and he's just ironing ironing out the parts of me that just don't need to be there but there is still a lot that needs to be less like me less like us and more like him amen zechariah 13 9 says that it talks about refining silver and trying gold through the fire now in goldsmithing when you try a fine metal like that you don't just dip it in the fire once and expect all the impurities to be separated out you keep dipping until you see a reflection until there isn't a trace of the imperfections left amen so the trials that we're facing tonight as much as the enemy thinks that he's victorious over us that is just god dipping us in the fire just trying us getting us ready for that soon return amen and it's truly god's mercy trials are preparing us for our eternal destination thanks bro that's how we should focus on our trials and see it as him perfecting us paul speaks of a trial that he was going through to the corinthians church the thorn it was a thorn in a side and the scripture doesn't exactly say what the thorn was probably for good reason that many of us might put ourselves in that in that same situation and not being able to get past it because we would think that only that thing would be what we can conquer and what we would glory in a tribulation amen but when he writes this he had actually already asked the lord three different times to take this thing from him and finally the lord just spoke to him spoke to him and he said that my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness amen glory through it all his grace is sufficient in our weaknesses now ephesians 6 now i'm just building a little bit here ephesians 6 speaks of what we're fighting against fighting against the principalities and the powers and the rulers of the darkness of this world amen but scripture doesn't stop there and do must to live subjected to defeat to be defeated by those powers the word arms us with a weapon with the sword of the spirit to not only defend against but to attack and defeat every single time amen colossians 2. i'm just going to build up a little bit here so that we can disarm the enemy a little bit amen colossians 2 15 says he disarmed those principalities he stripped their power he spoiled them and he made a show of them opening openly triumphing over them by nailing every power that the enemy had to the cross amen and not only did he overcome and triumph over them hebrews 2 said in verse 17 18 it says wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brother that he might be a merciful and high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for the for that in himself hath being tempted he is able to secure all that are tempted that word sakura actually translates and says that it would be an assistance and a support in times of hardship and distress so he made himself like us so that we could face those principalities and powers and he would be a faithful high priest and be there with us through it all amen and those very powers were actually created for him and by him colossians 1 16 says for by him all things were created and in heaven and in earth visible and invisible whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created for him and through him not only that but there is a limit to the enemy's power amen in romans 8 38 it says for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any creature nothing can separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus with christ jesus lives in me he overcame these things so that means that those things can't overcome me amen just like the pastor always is saying the devil ain't nothing amen he's just mad that we're eternal beings and he's not we find uh we're gonna we're gonna look through some um we're gonna look through some more scripture here uh you know sometimes the enemy can get so angry at us and with us as the children of god because we are always being delivered from his hand every time he will do everything he can though to kill us and destroy us remember he's our adversary david said that we find david in a point in first samuel and verse first samuel 27 chapter 27 we find david at a point of such discouraging discouragement in his spirit at this point david had just uh this was this was actually three years after the victory over the philistine army by celane goliath and david was at a time where he was fleeing from saul he was running for his life and and it was i think three or four different times where he had actually escaped death and david spent most of that time fleeing from scott saul and that discouragement actually seeped down into his spirit and verse verse 1 it says and david said in his art i shall now perish one day by the hand of saul there is nothing better for me than that i should speedily speedily escape into the land of the philistines into the land of the enemy and saul shall despair of me to seek any more in any coast of israel so shall i escape out of his hand sometimes we can't recognize it right away but trauma the trauma that he was facing can cause believers to slip into a state of spiritual amnesia david was already at this point anointed to be king of israel by samuel several chapters later earlier he was all he had already defeated goliath years earlier and he was actually promoted to high ranks among the army of israel he had much respect in the land and god was with him wherever he went amen yet he found through a great trial himself in psalms 18 we don't have to go but in psalms 18 4 and 5 it says the sorrows of death come past me this is david speaking and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid and the sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me it said he said in his heart that there is nothing better for me that i should escape because saul is going to kill me anyway he was going through a great trial a great trauma and what we can easily forget that in those times of great trial and trauma it's just actually the starting point for a merciful road to deliverance to a powerful deliverance amen because if we never went through those times of great trial or great trauma or great disappointment our character in christ wouldn't be where it is today amen because character in christ comes through victory now the prophet shows us this in uh picking it up in the smirny and church age and this is a bit of a lengthy quote but i'm just going to make some comments and there was everything in this was just so good i couldn't take anything out but so the lord god almighty says i know that here he is walking in the midst of the people there he is the chief shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says i know your tribulation i am not at all unmindful of your suffering but what a stumbling block this is to so many people like israel they wonder if really god loves them how can god be just and loving if he just stands by and watches his people suffer i've heard that all so many times over the years how can he watch people suffer this is what they ask in malachi 1 1-3 the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi i have loved you saith the lord yet ye say wherein hastil loved us was not he saw jacob's brother sayeth the lord yet i loved jacob and i hated esau and laid his mountains and his heritage a waste for dragons of the wilderness you see they couldn't figure out god's love they thought that love meant no suffering and they thought that love meant a baby with prenatal care but god says that his love was elective love amen and the proof of his love is election that no matter what happens his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because he picks up a scripture because god has chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth amen how many of us tonight believe the truth of this message tonight he may commit you to the death as he did paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job but that is his prerogative i'm still in the quote so bear with me he is sovereign but it is all with a purpose amen if it did not if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace but he's the author of peace amen his purpose is that after we have suffered a while that we would be made perfect and be established and strengthened and settled job says he put strength in us in job 23 he himself suffered he learned obedience by those things which he suffered and he was made perfect by those things amen though yet he were a son he learned obedience by the things that he suffered and he was and he was being made perfect amen that's what trials are it's making us perfect through the love of god and in plain language the prophet says the very character of jesus was perfected by suffering no man suffered more than jesus christ and according to paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in god while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection but the prophet picks up and he says why does he stand by the reason is in romans 8 he says and if children than heirs and heirs of god joint heirs with christ amen if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be care compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us and he picks this up and he says unless we suffer with him then we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign amen the reason that this charac that this character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift satan is so mad at us for this reason because he has never won a true victory like we have he possesses zero character and he's so mad that he can't get us to serve him hey man he doesn't even understand those things that he does to us that he gets us with those trials that he gets us with that he thinks that he's got us but really what those things are doing are just getting us closer to our position in jesus christ they're getting us closer to reigning with jesus christ so bring it on satan give me all you got because i'm getting closer and you're doing it by your trials that you're sending me a man a man without character can't reign because apart from character because power apart from character is satanic but the but power with character is fit to rule amen and since he wants us to share his throne with us since he wants to share his throne even on the same basis that he overcame then we have to overcome to sit in the throne with him and the little temporary suffering that is now that is it's not worthy to be compared with the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation amen thinking not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try to you is it strange that god wants to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir this is a special and we're talking about this was this was in the smyrna in church age so we're talking about the condition in the smyrnan church age but it says that the prophet says that this must be applied to every age there is no age free from it there is no true believer how many true believers i have here tonight this is of god and this is the will of god it is needful we need the lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ christ-like in doing it to be christ-like in our suffering that is a responsibility that each of us have does he love us yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us his spirit placing us as sons and coming down to the end of it he says and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself listen here by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he is in wisdom allows it to come to pass in his wisdom amen so we know this to be truth glory yet sometimes we fall into that state of forgetfulness none of us are exempt from that forgetful state either because we all suffer traumas we all suffer hurts we all suffer trials amen but it's so often times that that when you're in the middle of it how how you think to yourself how can this possibly work out for my good we start we start thinking we start trying to have the mind of god in us how is this possibly going to work out for my good we we we try to play that why oh lord would this happen to me and you begin to ask yourself as i'm sure david did what could i have done differently for saul not to want to kill me what did i do to earn this why is this happening could i have done more his current state caused his mind to drift now i want you i'm going to pick this up later i don't want to get ahead of myself but the discouragement isn't a sin the discouragement happens it's going to happen to each of every each and every one of us but what david allowed the discouragement to grow into became sin amen he left the land of promise and went into the philistine land the enemy's land and later on we go to find out that he didn't even seek the lord he was backslidden for over a year a year and a half in fact amen your wonderings don't just affect you they affect those around you pick this up david arose and he passed over with 600 men that were with him unto akish the son of mayok the king of gaith and they and david dwelt with achish at gath he and his men every man with his household even david with his two wives so he had 600 men 600 men's wives 600 men's children his wives david fled to the enemy's territory but and sometimes we don't realize it but our state of being affects everyone around you your family your children your church body each one of us you may not think of it but each one of you are a tremendous influence on somebody amen brother brandon picks us up he says when aiken took a wedge it wasn't god's shape faith that did it it was a babylonian garment we're going to pick that up later but when one uh and a wedge of gold out of the camp and when he did it it hindered the whole battle one person hindered the whole battle one member he says suffers all members suffer what god is coming to one of these days brothers is a church without spot or wrinkle he's coming to a spirit-filled church that divinely love of god so welded together in our hearts that that we'll walk as one that's where i want to be that's where each of one of us should want to be amen first samuel 29 now we're going to skip a little bit here but first samuel 29 and we'll just paraphrase here but the thing being played out here is that the philistines were actually gathering together to fight against the israelites once again now and this was this was david was still in the land of akush at this time yet this time one one person that was at once their greatest foe amen remember he he slew goliath which was one of their great generals at one time so many years prior was now getting ready to fight with the philistines the same philistines which he defeated know three years prior that discouragement seeped into david's spirit and even the philistine leaders questioned what was happening in verse 29 it says what do these hebrews do here they knew david and his reputation against their army amen but sometimes we find ourselves in david's position so far into the enemy's territory that we're lost we're backslidden and it was from something that was a discouragement that we should have been able to overcome by the word of god but it seeped into our spirit amen another incredible we and we find this we're going to pick this up in joshua another incredible warrior of the faith took the baton from moses we're familiar with the story and to cross the people over to jordan and there's so many types in the old testament but the type here is that we're not yet in the promised land but we're fighting to get there but we have crossed over jordan we have the holy ghost in our lives and we're cross and we're fighting our way to the promised land and when he says that joshua picks this up and he says that every or the lord says to joshua that every thing every land that your foot treads upon will be yours it will be your possession not one foe will defeat you yet this time something something happened okay he came you know we're all familiar with jericho he finds himself victorious after a battle with jericho and the lord was with him and they marched around and they didn't even have to to fight after the captain of of salvation came and showed himself to him yet the very next battle arises and he didn't realize that sin had actually gotten into the camp joshua 7 and we're just going to go through you don't have to put up joshua 7 a man named aitkin had taken from the spoils of jericho you know this time a sin that it just didn't seem so major you know the god commanded uh joshua not to take any spoils from jericho yet one man decided that he was gonna take a spoil because because satan planted a seed in his mind that this isn't this isn't a big deal this is you know i'm really i'm i'm kind of on gray territory here and it doesn't seem like you know what what are they getting they're not going to use it like they're dead now why would why can't we use it that's how the enemy works in our minds he plants that seed he plants that seed of discrepancy where something that may not be a sin can quickly turn itself into a sin amen this time the sins didn't seem so major but he disobeyed god's word every word of the lord is god's word and we are not to disobey one word of it we can't take some and not the other we can't take it from here and not from here it's the whole word amen and the enemy slipped in joshua didn't know it though so he just sent a small portion of his army to battle ai they were a small enemy and they he didn't think too much of it so they just he just said a small portion of the army but the lord wasn't with them in the battle and they were driven back it says that they suffered casualties amen joshua 7 and 5 says that the word the hearts of the people melted and became his water because they had remembered that word of the lord that everything that our feet were going to tread upon would be ours they had just seen a a a victory like jericho take place there was there was triumphant there was there was gumption in their in their hearts because they knew that the word of god was with them wherever they went yet they just suffered a loss from a small battle so they it says that the people's hearts melted who's ever felt like that before who's ever gone before you know they're in the middle of a trial and you fall and you slip and you're like man why wha what is happening what is going on those little things that you don't the the enemy slips in you don't think that they're big or whatever but they are amen they matter to god the little things matter to god and sometimes we do that spiritually we seek to fight the enemy without first going to the lord amen one a couple a couple times ago we were talking about seeking the lord in everything we have to go before the lord before every before every trial before everything and we have to constantly brother jason was saying we have to constantly mark our books with him we have to constantly check ourselves and our lord are we still in your perfect will i know you had your word of the lord here and i'm following that to the best of my ability but you still need to seek after his word amen you promise joshua finds himself seeking leadership after the defeat he says lord you promised everything that our foot feet would tread upon would be ours but why so why have we lost this you know why is this trial getting to us what have we done lord and the lord replies that there is sin amongst your camp that aiken had taken of the spoils against my commandment well iran picks us up in adoption he says in the promised land everything belongs to us in the promised land see everything in the promised land when israel crossed over into jordan into the promised land they fought down everything now remember in this promised land that don't mean that you're immune from sickness that don't mean that you're immune from troubles but it does spell this so let this just sink so deep it says this that it is yours just rise and take it and remember that the only way israel ever lost a man is when sin got into the camp that's the only way that we can ever lose a victory is for sin to get into the camp amen something went wrong somewhere aiken stole a wedge that babylonian garment and a sin was in the camp the battle went wrong the prophet says that the only way we can ever lose a victory is if sin gets in our camp you know the victory is laid within the journey but it's a journey of obedience to every word of god humbling yourself at every turn and laying aside as hebrews would say laying aside every weight and every sin every weight means you know the unforgiveness of a brother or the lust or the habits that you don't think are big things they matter to god laying aside every weight and every sin that so easily besets us because they do so easily beset us amen suffering like paul in corinthians yet glorying and knowing that his grace is sufficient we're types of those people today we've crossed over jordan and now we're heading into the land of promise but and everything our feet are supposed to tread upon we would overcome but overcoming doesn't always look as as it seems overcoming is taking that discouragement and not allowing it to seep into our spirit overcoming is allowing the word of god to discern your heart and those little sins to be purged out constantly seeking after him amen he didn't say that it would be free of troubles and he didn't say it would be a flowery bed of ease amen sin had gotten in the camp and it wasn't what we should think of sin it was so small it was taking of the garment holding on to that habit and many many times like david it will cause you to come to a backslidden condition and you don't you're not even realizing that you're in it you're still coming to church you're still reading your bible you're still praying but the connection with the holy ghost is hindered somehow amen and you're backslidden and not even realizing and in the enemy territory without even realizing it trials tribulations don't mistake those things for sin those are mercies from god transforming us remember remember in job he was sinless he found himself consider my servant job i think i've mentioned him in every single one of my sermons but it it's not for when you're free of troubles that's not showing god's love god's love is when you have troubles but yet in the midst of the troubles you can joy and glory in it amen how often do we let those things get us so low that we have lapsed in our trusting of god we forget that he's always been faithful amen he's always been faithful he was always faithful to david but once god not once god had failed to protect him all those times with the bear and the lion and goliath and each time saul had tried to kill him yet david finds himself discouraged and you love david through the scriptures because you can so identify with almost everything that he goes through i mean everything you're like wow so he it says he found himself discouraged so he ventures off you know thinking that saul was going to kill him anyway and this was after the anointing this was he lapsed in trusting god and during that year and a half time period he doesn't seek after the will of god one time it says that scripture doesn't show him seeking after god's will god's direction not even one time in fact he doesn't even think about god during this time because his mind was so just traumatized by what had happened david and his army went back to ziklag in first samuel versus first samuel 30 and when they went back to ziklag after the philistines had rejected allowing him to fight with him they found what was what felt like to be more than they could bear amen they came over the hill to return to their families their wives and their children like after anything you came you come home to you know after work and you know you want to see your wife and your little new little baby girl and and they're not there something something has happened you don't know what happened to them and not only that they weren't there it says that they had taken everything and they had burned the place that they were in the amalekites had swept through in their absence and took all of their families captive burned down their houses their possessions their they were gone and all that they knew and loved at this point in their life was gone verse four it says that they wept until they had no power to weep who has been there before amen just weeping just in within your spirit doesn't even have to be physically crying but just you don't know where to go you don't know where to turn because you're in a state of spiritual amnesia i know exactly where to turn god shows you where to turn every time and the lord will allow such things to happen so that all you can do is lie on your back and look up to him but always remember god will never leave you or forsake you he will allow the enemy a certain leeway like he allowed the amalekites a certain leeway so that he could get david back into his position into his rightful throne amen david david's wives and all this men everything was gone when we look at this history it's really important to stop and kind of put yourself in in their position okay where everything that was gone everything that was true to them everything that was true to you everything that you know and you and you really you know you don't think that you're really out of the will of god because you know a discouragement like i said it's not the sin but it had led to the sin amen and you find yourself doing the same things it what would i i read one commentary and it said that david had david needed to flee to the land of the philistines because saul was pursuing after him no david did not need to flee to the enemy's land he was in the land of promise god wherever your land is you will conquer it with the word of god you just have to stand and trust in god when you have nothing else to trust in amen the enemy can be ruthless in those times of ins of uncertainty you know where where my family go had they been destroyed you know would i ever am i ever gonna see them again he sends he sends mind battles he plagues your mind with unimaginable things that's that's when satan is is at his high point and they became so distressed that they actually wanted to stone david and in later verses it says that the amalekites were rejoicing and dancing and partying after they had taken from the spoils of david now remember david david was out of the land of promise but he's still god's son amen you may be out of the will of god but you're still god's son so he just you just have to make one turn one confession one repentance and you're right back on that path amen glory to god it says you know the enemy you know the enemy uh he'll laugh at he'll laugh at you he'll laugh when he sees someone now i'll take a little bit of a turn here he laughs when he sees someone that we hold dear to us not serving god living in the world amen we're all we all have someone that we hold dear to us that isn't serving god maybe in the capacity that they should or at all and he thinks that because of that that he's got a victory over us or when he sees one of us fail one of us falter one of us allow the discouragement in our spirit he thinks i mean he's over there rejoicing and why why do you think that is it's because satan can't see the future satan is not omniscient and he's on omnipresent all satan can do is plan and react he cannot see the future like christ can little does he know that the real victor will show up later that night and take back everything that the enemy stole from you everything your family your children your sons your daughters everything will be returned back to you as long as you seek after the will of god and you apply the token on their life amen david's memory came back to him he remembered his position in this time of low you know you're just sitting down and you're in your in your lowest point and the only place you have to look up is up that is when god will bring to your remembrance who you are and you know what we have today where we're living at that david didn't have is that we are a bunch of davids amen you are david's when you share something with your brothers and your sisters who have faced maybe similar tragedy or similar trauma or who you know they face the same enemy we've all got the same enemy that we face they can give you encouragement amen to press on you know i was facing something last week and i had a little bit of a discouragement in my life and you know i just shared with some brothers in a text knowing that they had years of experience of facing the same enemy that i faced i knew that it would encourage me amen and satan will satan will even come and come at you when you're you're going to seek after encouragement from somebody and he'll say no you don't want to do that he'll say that you shouldn't share things with other people he'll he'll just he'll say that they'll just think lower of you amen this is how the this is how the mind battles work then they'll they'll they'll just think that your faith is too low and somehow lose respect for you that is the enemy friends they go to prayer for you a holy ghost-filled christian doesn't question you for a trial or a discouragement they encourage you amen that's why he orchestrated putting you into this assembly so that you'd have others you'd have each other to face those things with amen don't ever find yourself in a place where you think that you're the only one who has ever faced what you're going through there is nothing ecclesia i think it's ecclesiastes there is nothing new under the sun and rather than shutting people out open yourself up and allow them in to help you go through your experiences amen you were you were vulnerable for the snare that overtook you amen you were vulnerable for that thing that overtook you now be vulnerable to allow the holy spirit to mend you be vulnerable to allow your friends to encourage you it takes a certain amount of vulnerability it takes a certain amount of stepping out of your comfort zone and realizing that okay lord like you know i need i need some help in this i need i need my brothers and on my sisters the enemy's facing me i've got my mind battles plaguing me that's what that's when we look to each other we look to the body of believers that we have we look to our moms and our dads and our brothers and our sisters in christ amen amen we don't have moms and dads in christ but you know our moms and dads began crying david began crying out to the lord in psalms 18 it says verse 1 it says i will love thee o lord my strength and the lord is my rock and my salvation he began he began it says to encourage himself in the lord my fortress my deliverer my god my strength and whom i trust my buckler my horn of salvation my high tower i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i so i shall be saved from my enemies glory to god psalms 25 it says unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul oh my god i will trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not my enemies triumph over me psalms 34 it says i sought the lord and he delivered me from all of my fears psalms 40 says i waited these are all psalms that david wrote psalms 40 i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me he heard my cry he brought me out of this horrible pit out of the myrik clay and set my feet upon a rock he established my goings and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the lord amen he encouraged himself in the lord friends he was backslidden he had found himself in a place where he didn't even acknowledge god and his amnesia the discouragement his condition went on for so long and it took it took that place for david to come to where god was his only strength and you asked why would god strengthen him after this because god is rich in mercy and grace and because david was now completely broken now ready to be filled david finally remembered god's promise and his calling and his memory came back to him sometimes when a person has amnesia from some kind of trauma physically or mentally a familiar face or a voice or a place will trigger their memory to come back to them amen and there's a whole study you can do on that we're not going to get into that but let let that familiarity that you need be found for you tonight in the word of god amen don't let your condition go on any longer tonight amen first samuel 30 and verse 8 it says that he inquired of the lord and the lord and he said lord shall i pursue after my enemy shall i overtake them and the lord answers he says pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all that was lost amen glory to god i just want to soak in that for a minute and without fail he will suffer all to be given back to you amen every discouragement every fear every family member everything will be given back to us glory to god you know and out of the 600 men you know two of them were so they found themselves so distressed at the situation at their loss they couldn't even go with david to pursue after the enemy and now david with less of an army than when he started pursuing after an enemy that he had no idea what their number was he had no idea where they were but he had the word from the lord all it takes when you're 4 000 steps in the wrong direction is with a word from the lord to get you right back into step glory to god many times glory to god many times in scripture in our lives the lord will allow what little strength that we think that we possess to be stripped away so that we know that he is the one fighting for us glory because in our weaknesses he is made strong glory to god possess we shall recover all amen that promise still stands for tonight amen just as the enemy thought that he had victory our mighty conqueror would sweep in first samuel 30 and 16. it says and when he had brought him down behold they were spread abroad upon all the earth eating and drinking and mary and dancing because of all the spoil that they had taken the devil was laughing at you because you fell the devil is laughing because your your daughter your son is out in the world the devil's laughing because you you got something that's that's that's hindering you you got you've got a habit that he thinks that he's got you and just when he thinks that he has that victory over you david smote them and recovered all that was taken when the word promises restoration it doesn't have limitations glory to god i will restore saith the lord even if you go on your own path i will restore even if you get discouraged i will restore even if you get amnesia and forget your position i will bring to your remembrance who you are amen amen when we're coming up on easter amen and remember when the enemy thought that he had won the final victory jesus christ being nailed to the cross satan satan was just like the amalekites singing and dancing for joy finally i got rid of him finally finally this man oh i got him he's hung on a cross and there's no just it's just when that happens oh he hears a knock it did he here's a knock at hell's door and jesus christ was down there to take the keys of hell back from him hallelujah glory to god we have a mighty victor a greater than david amen to take back those keys hallelujah amen that scripture we turn into in hosea the valley of trouble or the valley of um aiken uh let's see let's turn back to it if we can uh 14 verse 15 i will give you her i will give her vineyards from thence and the valley of aker for a door of hope and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth now aiken had taken the spoils back to joshua aiken had taken the spoils and he allowed the enemy to slip in and joshua asks what that they what what do we need to do how do how do we get how do we what do we need to do lord and the lord says that you need to purge the sin from the camp you need to lay down that weight you need to lay down that forgive unforgiveness you need to lay down that lust you need to lay down that habit you need to lay down that snare it says snares that means anything that is hindering your relationship with the lord jesus christ lay down that thing that you won't let go of and god will take you to places where you need to be he will take those valleys of sin that you were in which the valley of uh aitkin became akin was purged and aiken became the valley of acor which translates literally to the valley of trouble and it was it says in verse 15 of hosea that that valley of akin that valley of trouble will be turned into a gateway of hope glory to god that snare was cast out the israelites didn't know whether or not they would get another victory after disobeying god it says remember it says that their hearts were melted with them within them you know we i've said this before but you know you can't read the scriptures and just skip ahead and think i mean this is this is their lives that they're living in they they had just suffered a defeat and now they all they had to do was turn back to the lord but they had disobeyed his word so now they didn't know if they were ever going to possess the land they didn't know if they were ever going to get another victory they were just at the mercy of jehovah what was once a snare in your life amen i'm talking to each one of us miss me you which was once a snare in your life the lord can turn that into a gateway of hope why is caleb why in the world did you tie those three things together how do they correlate the word of god is a masterpiece i was sitting in my study this morning just studying trying not to wake my baby up and i just headed a silent jubilee dancing and shouting when he showed me this oh glory for time's sake we don't need to turn there but for reference sake if you want to read at home hosea chapter one the word of one for one through five just read it when you get home on your own time but the word of the lord comes to hosea the prophet and it was an odd word he was commanded to take a prostitute for a wife and hosea listened to the lord and when he did that they had they were blessed with a child and their first child that was born the lord commanded hosea to name him jezreel and scripture references in the fifth verse that god would break the bow of israel in the valley of jezreel now i did some digging and to come to find out the valerie of jezreel is located within mount gilboa in the spur of the valley near the bottom of the mountain mount gilboa is the very place that the enemy slew saw and david's kingdom was restored back to david glory to god he'll take that valley of jezreel he'll take that valley of trouble and he'll turn it into a gateway of hope no one else like hosea could could prophesy like that he lord you want me to take who and and do what oh but he turned it around glory to god it just goes to show that it doesn't matter where you're at does it matter what how far you feel like you're down the lord can take you from the place that you're at into a gateway of hope glory to god oh you'll never tell me the word of god is an inspired that was a thousand years apart and the lord jesus was hosea was 800 years after joshua glory to god don't think that your valley is too big tonight nothing is out of reach for the orchestrator hallelujah you can think your weight your snare your sin is the most low down thing and no doubt it is it is low down all sin is low down and it's not a place for the house of god but that's why we come into the house of god because it's a house of correction amen and i want the lord jesus to correct me in everything in every way that every snare that so easily besets me glory to god there is a swift pack pathway back to deliverance and that is confession and it's repentance glory to god my cousin made an incredible statement i get a lot of my inspiration from him i was sharing with him that thing that i was going through last week and he said you know caleb you know this thing though it doesn't seem so now may be one of the most important things that you go through because that discouragement that thing the the mind battles that started to rage i can now stomp on the devil and say that doesn't matter because i've got a victor who's gonna break every chain in my life i'm not gonna live in the valley of discouragement like david did i'm not gonna live in the valley of sin i'm not gonna live in the valley of acor i'm gonna be like hosea and his wife i'm gonna live in the gateway of hope that the lord has brought me into glory to god oh glory to god each one of you tonight are davids glory to god stand with me as much as i'm sure that david wished that he didn't that he didn't have to flee from saul for so long or find himself in that place so much of the rest of his life so much of the psalms were shaped because of those experiences that he had so much of those things that you go through although you don't want to go through them those things shape who you will be who you will be in christ remember that without a battle then you will not reign with christ so those things that you're battling will become your victory and then you'll have character now remember satan doesn't have character so you've got that on him glory to god brother branham picks it up and oh in the great warrior david who is that uncircumcised devil who is that devil that has no relationship with god at all who is that devil that stands with nothing but a defeated thing behind him his master was defeated at calvary by our lord and our conqueror hallelujah he's a bluff that's all we won't believe him any more down with him jesus christ robbed satan of everything he had he spoiled principalities powers dominions his domain reigns over the heavens and we are the subject of his domain hallelujah my that puts him where he belongs glory to god you're called you are elected you are anointed you are positionally placed put into the body of christ by the baptism of the holy ghost amen and he's defeated tonight hallelujah glory to god stand victorious you bunch of davids oh david felt the same way that we have felt before a heart likened unto water melted in psalms psalms 18 it says oh that he was oh he he was it says that he drew near to god he drew me out of many waters remember when it says that they melted their hearts melted like water david's heart melted like that but it says that the lord jesus drew me out of those many waters he delivered me from my strong enemy psalm 6 18 verse 16 and from them which hated me for they were too strong for me they prevented me in the day of calamity but the lord was my stay glory to god the lord is the lord is our state tonight he will deliver us from our strong enemy glory to god claim it tonight for your family claim it for everything everybody just let's us bow our hearts tonight bow our heads claim it for everything tonight friends for everything that you think that the enemy may have over you because our valley of trouble has turned into by the mercies of god a gateway for hope are you in the valley of trouble tonight are you in the valley of discouragement are you in the valley of aiken do we believe the word of god let the word of god discern your hearts tonight as hebrews say and lay it down lord discern thoughts and the intents of my

skies and still waters signs of his love and approval his approval of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world then brother adam says does he love us say does he love me ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so how do i know the lord loves me brother matt because he said he loved you and manifested that he did love
