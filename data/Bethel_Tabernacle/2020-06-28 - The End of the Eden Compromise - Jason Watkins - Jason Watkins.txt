half the battle amen there's the the application side of it amen every time well god bless you again amen happy to be back here in the pulpit this morning had a nice time in the sunday-school class and so just looking forward to what the Lord has for us further amen and want to take a subject today the end of the eden compromise want to invite you into your Bibles to Genesis chapter 3 I've got some announcements I want to make and so let me just set you down for a minute while I make these announcements and just stay where you are musicians want everybody to hear this and especially online all others also so I was kind of notifying you this morning there's some things that look like they're coming down the pipe from the government there's been a question between the governor of our state and the Attorney General about requiring face masks by mandatory requirement when you're in public now of course there's the whole can of worms what does that mean you know in your own private business is a church a business all these kind of legal questions and you know there's a certain amount of a certain amount of compliance that you require that you that we need as a church to go along otherwise we lose our nonprofit status and then none of your contributions are tax deductible anymore sudden they can charge property tax to this property this would be a big financial hit on us as a church because we are in fact a church and we have one purpose here and that's to lift up Christ to the to the world so the governor was thinking that there is no way to make that legal that it's against our constitutional rights the Attorney General South Carolina weighed in to said it's perfectly legal now that doesn't mean anything because then judges can overrule him so you know the nation the world is in chaos right now and you know you can have governors and turny generals doing one thing and then you know here the governor of New York and the mayor of New York City just came under a federal federal judge ruled heavily against them to say you know you can't force that you know all these things you're trying to force on churches when you yourselves are out there marching in the streets you know a thousands of people shoulder to shoulder then you're gonna come around and tell churches that they can't worship you know with more than a few people so these kinds of things right now are just topsy-turvy there is we don't know what's going to happen it may come Buford City I think Buford City Council was voting on whether or not to require that inside the city limits which we are inside the city limits this this is the street that divides Beaufort from Port Royal however you have to go all the way up a little ways to get back over into Port Royal we are in Beaufort city so we'd be subject to that I don't see how that could be managed you know we so we've thought about are we going to have to go back to broadcast only the answer is we'll see we'll see we don't know what we do know is that right now we can continue gathering right now we're gathering by using 50 percent of the alphabet ironically and thankfully I didn't really have to do much math because it just so happened when I looked at the church director sister Wanda built for us the it literally divided almost to a person like within two people of being a perfect division down the middle so today so this weekend k2z and Wednesday night that'll carry again then next Sunday to be back to a through J and then that'll carry into the Wednesday so we've made you know now let me just speak to the reality some things that we can also see definitely this virus is spiking definitely there are more hospitalizations which is really the only hard number I look at anyway that you're gonna have more positive results if you test more and there's quite a quite a growing medical opinion for many doctors that we're all going to contact it eventually you can't stop it and we're all and the many people that probably already have it and don't ever know they had it they were completely asymptomatic and and even have some immunity to it now so but at the same time there are increasing hospitalizations our own hospital here with the normal people that they have admitted knock Ovid just admitted for various things plus now some some new spiking in kovat hospitalizations our Hospital here is running pretty near capacity according to birth Andrew working out of the ER there they're running pretty near capacity and so you know it's unusual to have a flu bug I mean what kind of flu bug survives into the summer that's unheard of and this thing here we are almost in July and this strain is not only surviving it's it's surging so naturally we have some concerns good Christian people have died it does true it is true that it's a very low mortality rate it's much seems to be much more contagious from the best evidence they can find so we've had different things in in place here like you know suspending half the congregation's that way we can set generally with families and social distance we want to be in compliance because that is what they're asking us to do plus it's the prudent thing to do not just our testimony that's half of it but the other half is what is prudent we've said we don't want to do anything in fear but we do want to be for this reason because that it does seem to be surging and in fact the hard number of hospitalizations does seem to be increasing to a certain degree I don't think it's the hype that the media's making of it but friends it would devastate me too you know for anyone in here to have a critical you know we we prayed brother Charles through a near-death experience and you know I just don't want to see us go through that again we've we've closed the fellowship hall from afternoon fellowship so that's a little bit it's all about an odds game it's all trying to end it to decrease the odds that it could be spread to increase the odds that it won't so we've we've closed the fellowship hall and we love that I hate that but I think with it surging like it is and it's not abating even though summer heat is upon it in Arizona they're dealing with a hundred and eleven degrees to talk to brother Michael Alderson 111 and it's still surging so this is that what flu bug does that so we're just going to have to take some tighten up a little bit again at at present we're going to continue to to hold our Sunday school to hold the regular Sunday service and to hold Wednesday night services there are some other things that we want to to announce today after today the Sunday school class will be streaming only ok so so again it's all it's all playing the odds it's limiting the exposure if we can cut your exposure down from two and a half hours down to you know hour and forty-five minutes or two hours then that's a plot that's a plus that's a game so the Sunday school class the adult Sunday School class will still be held it'll just it'll just need a minister and some booth personnel we won't even need the musicians for the Sunday school class so just whatever your your team leader whatever whichever worship leader wants you here at whatever time just meet at that time but I'm even cautioning the team leaders to not bring you in too early and we're trying to limit the time that we're proximity look friends you know I there some people say you should stop holding church well I mean we go to Walmart we go to restaurants so I mean come on you know and and I get that good people have perished God's family God in His wisdom has allowed it there they're members of gods family who die of cancer even though jesus healed us all at Calvary there are those who died the seasonal flu this is not many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivers us from them all whether I'm healed here I get heal beyond the grave who cares none of this is gonna matter ten thousand years now I'm not gonna care so you know I'm living for the other side and um my my hope is in the Lord and so our Sunday School will switch to streaming only so my advice to you would be you know I know that some of you and and it's good it's wonderful love to get here early some twenty thirty minutes early well you know let's let's just try to limit that to maybe don't come in you know until maybe 10 minutes before the service starts make sure the Sunday school is dismissed you know and then then if you want to come in after that you'd be fine because there's only about a 10 minute intermission anyway and that wouldn't be coming in too soon but don't come into the sanctuary with the with the Sunday school going on in fact is don't enter the building so even to the even to the restrooms are the musicians I'll give them a little bit of a pass and the booth personnel and officers sometimes they have to get in here and do what they do to make the service go so I get that but please we are going to keep the Sunday school to streaming only the fellowship hall as I've said is going to be closed until further notice Sunday school will be streamed until further notice we are going to continue to meet for the regular Sunday service for now and we are going to continue to meet for the Wednesday I consider moving that streaming but I've decided against it we're still going to continue to use half the alphabet now the Deacons and the trustees are forming up a team together because it would quickly overwhelm the Deacons trying to do it all what I'm about to announce the trustees are going to help them we're we're beginning Wednesday we're we are insisting insisting on very strict social distancing as bad as we hate it we live in the south but no more handshaking no more no more physical contact of any kind when church is over please if you go out front only stay out there a few minutes and stay distanced do not if you want to use the World Health Organization of three feet fine that's fine but don't be inside of that and don't linger out there you should just leave the property after I know we're southern I know we love that we love greeting we love talking we love seeing each other that's who we are it's what we are and you know I don't think we ever foresaw a day that this would come but I don't think we'll ever go back to totally normal friends we're at the end you know and and that's not a dreadful thing to us Paul said people say oh you're McCarver you're negative no I'm just quoting the Apostle Paul for me to live as Christ but to dies gain to go on to glory would be gain so if I'm gonna have to stay here I'm for sure gonna live for Christ I'm gonna make my I'm gonna make every second count for his kingdom and also the the Deacons with the assistance of the trustees are going to implement a practice of of we're going to have a whole monitor and when musicians people come in for the restroom musicians come in when I come in to go to my office there's going to be a deacon or trustee back there with chemicals gloves and a rag he's going to every time you touch a handle he's gonna wipe it behind you you go in and out of a restroom don't go in till the till the monitor can wipe that down and and and it's all about reducing the odds that's all it is we can't be a hundred percent there's no way there's no way we can't you know put off some fogger in the bathroom every time somebody comes out to you know disinfect everything just you can't do it and there's going to be things that slip between the cracks this is only about reducing the odds you get that now and then when you go out of that door when you when you when you before service deacons are going to be outside to open the door for you if you open it ahead of them then they're gonna clean it off before the next person touches it and we're gonna have a person in the back hallway monitoring now friends running to the restroom during service III don't want to we don't want to police state here goodness no this is a church all right we're not trying to form a police state but just know this you know that that that it is it is I've seen it my whole life it just seemed like no matter what you say you know about you know running in and out teenagers running in and out mothers taking children in and out I understand it has to happen sometimes sometimes a mother has a little baby they've gotta go she's gonna take them that's what that's the reality I'm not against that if you have a medical condition if you have a situation and you just have to go to the restroom then go that's what we have them for this is your church you understand it's not my church but you have set me up as a pastor in the we have elders here who make some of these group decisions for us so that we don't have to poll you for everything we do and and just know this that if you run to the restroom during service a deacon he's not gonna follow you they're not gonna stalk you but when you come back in he's gonna have to go out that door go to the bathroom clean everything off he's not even gonna know what you touched he's got to clean everything he's gonna have to come back to the door wipe the door down again wipe the striker pad down again so my request to you on their behalf is don't do it please it's it's it literally is to the point where I I won't do it but I could put a list of names on a board of teenagers and this has been historical it's not just in the present but we have had and have teenagers who go out by schedule and I don't have to go to the bathroom they just go out by schedule you can set your watch by I've sit in the back and said okay we've been going about thirty it's just about two oh yeah there they go mmm okay and wait another 20 minutes okay it's just about time for there they go and I've sit back there and watched it take place I don't want to you know browbeat you today but that's that's ridiculous I've seen little children not little little I get little little ones have to go out but I've seen you know grown-up children big boys and big girls but still children and like clockwork mommy I gotta go to the bathroom and here goes mommy taking him out two and three at a time it is not necessary I say that by experienced I wasn't raised that way sister Jean did not play that you went to the restroom before service and you didn't go again till afterward unless you had an emergency and being a mother she could tell what was it emergency mothers have a way of knowing and don't understand that but they have a way and I know that raising kids you know my boys were strictly they went before church they didn't go during church and if they had a crisis they knew better than to even ask so if they ask I kind of figured they must really need to go and I would let them go but it was so rare now you say brother Jason you didn't raise girl well I married a girl who doesn't run in and out my mother's a girl who doesn't run in and out so my sister wasn't allowed to run in and out so I am speaking qualitatively to you today it's not necessary and you should stop doing it now and in the future hopefully now because we're in a pandemic and the Deacons are going to have to go behind you it's it's it's really going to be extra bad if you continue to do that so we're asking you nicely every man wants to always wants to lose weight but they don't want to lose weight that way running in and out of the door chasing everybody going behind everybody so please try your best they're going to begin that Wednesday night they have a lot of trepidation we talked it out you know there was even a suggestion look if we got to go to that link we should just stay home but I said brothers I think we can pull it off I will good them I will get in the pulpit I will speak up for you to let the people know don't do your deacons and trustees that way because they're under a mandate they'll have to go if you go out they will have to go behind you and so and every time you do it they all have to do it so so please let's have cooperation because right now we're in unsettling uncertain times the only thing that we have certain as we were speaking in the sunday-school class today is God in His Word are the only certain things and so we have peace and confidence in that praise the Lord and so if I accidentally cuz I do it all the time if I accidentally all the time I do it on purpose but now I'm gonna try to not say turn around shake hands if I accidentally do that just smile at me and just wave at each other and just looking wave and do a virtual handshake but don't actually do it let's even not do it among families I'm gonna try to resist not saying that amen I know we're southern I know we love that but we're just going to have to hey maybe in another month this'll all you know settle down we don't know but then you know before before long the fall is coming back in flu season seasonal flu season starts so we're just taking this as we go we're figuring it out as best as we can amen god bless you let's stand now I'm gonna I've used up half my preaching time so you're gonna get a Sunday School lesson sermon and I'm gonna I'm gonna go fast so so just let's look in our Bibles to Genesis chapter 3 and I am gonna watch the clock very closely I'm not determined by any means to finish today I probably won't be in fact as I'm quite sure I can't years of experience looking at my notes I'd know I can't so I'm not gonna try so just give me your undivided attention for 30-40 minutes okay all right amen I ever tell you all about my old doctor when I first moved here doc doc brown great doctor great it was a color dr. gray and thank you sister mom and and dr. gray he was he was we're talking about you know the gospel and preaching and you know he was bragging that he had never fallen asleep in in during a sermon in his life and he was an old man I was impressed and I said Wow dr. gray that's he went to the Episcopal Church I think and you know I've heard of Pisgah poles are basically Catholics who vote Republican but they don't they don't always appreciate that joke but but he was a good guy I like dr. gray he was a real Christian man real no kidding he was a Christian gentleman and I really liked him and and and so he he he said he said I've never fall asleep during a sermon I said dr. gray that's amazing I am so impressed to hear you say that I said well I don't I don't I don't preach very long I said I I try to be make it interesting as best I can and I said I'd usually try to stop in about maybe an hour at most and you'd have thought lightning hit him he literally jolted in his body said oh my goodness I've never heard a sermon more than 15 minutes and suddenly I was less proud of me than I had been but I sure loved him he was a good old guy I don't know if he's even still living but he was he was a Christian gentleman and I sure appreciate Oh doc gray amen alright friends let's get into the Word of God amen we probably shouldn't have that much humor in the pulpit approaching the word so let's read a man in Genesis chapter 3 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yayyyy hath God said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we made of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die it's very obvious it was a different kind of a tree that it wasn't the kind that was planted in the ground and grew fruit because God had already told him every tree is good for fruit now he's not changing what he said he's just simply talking about a different kind of a tree all right so the symbolism changes from literal to symbolic and he says and so the serpent continuing now verse 4 and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat gave also unto her husband with her he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of God walking in the garden and the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees let's pray father now we come Lord and we want to focus our hearts and minds we had announcements to make Lord and these are vital announcements and I'm sorry to have had to cut in on your time in the ministry today but they were necessary Lord to make it I'm sure you understand and father help us now to sober our minds and be serious as we look at your word we commit ourselves into your hands for the reading the hearing and the obedience to your word in Jesus name Amen god bless you as you're seated and we're going to have the brothers put up second Corinthians 11:1 to 4 Paul speaking now I would to God Paul now is going to go back and reference the historical account of what happened in the Garden of Eden I would to God he could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me for I am jealous over you with the godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ for if he that cometh preaches preach a--the another Jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another spirit which he have not received or another gospel which he have not accepted you might well bear with him that was Paul's fear that they might bear with it and that would be a horrific mistake his whole point is that look when Eve was in the garden she followed another Jesus you understand and and she followed now this other Jesus that's that Paul is referring to there's only one true Jesus the other Jesus is a fake Jesus called the Antichrist that tries to mimic Jesus we saw him coming out on a white horse in the book of Revelation and it looked like Christ but it wasn't it was a deceiver he had a bow but he had no arrows and so we realized that God had to send forth in the book of Revelation the anointing of the lion to combat him because the lion was the pure Word of God this was what Paul was preaching under under the lion anointing and he was warning the church or not tik-tok preaching on the original sin today the only thing I want to connect to is that that Eve heard the words of the Lord you shall not eat it you shall not touch it Eve even it even adds we're not even to look at it which was probably good advice and and but now another another one not her husband not the first Adam not the one would become the second Adam not either one of those they had given her the word her husband Adam the first Adam who was the son of God kept the Word of God would not transgress and the devil had no way to talk him into it but we find out that because that the woman came from the man that she's literally a result taken from him a byproduct of him then she had a vulnerability to her reasoning and now another Jesus a false one operating through the serpent a subtle beast not a snake crawling on the ground yeah you ever seen a talking snake so so this wasn't a snake that's what he became this was a beast of the field that stood upright like a man he's the missing link that science can't find today that stands between men and the ape or the chimpanzee God cursed his form and put him on his belly but at this time he had did not have a soul but he had a place for one so Satan could enter him and actually talk to Eve and convince her she's listening to another Jesus now and it's causing the fall of all men now Paul is coming to say look now the real Jesus has come and now we have the the the the complete restored Word we now have the we now have access to what Adam lost Paul had that in his day that's not unique to our day our days only been restored to Paul's day Paul had that restoration of fellowship with God like Adam had and so we realize then that that that that when we we see the trick of the enemy now I'm I had a PowerPoint Caleb I'm gonna I'm not gonna use it because it slows me down I got to go too fast today I'm just gonna read some of these quotes so brother Brent says and a greater than Solomon is here do you believe that we are living in one of those wicked and adulterous generations say amen to that certainly we are as I've said many times this nation can never escape the damnation and wrath of God I'm an American an important point we've been making a lot of things talking about politics I want you to get a Prophet's position I he says certainly we are an adulterous generation as I've said many times that this nation can never escape the damnation and wrath of God and he says I am an American many of the Brennan's are buried yonder out on the fields blowed up in the wars and if it was to come tonight to make a choice America's my country I love it but I don't love the sins that it's doing god loves America this is 1958 now this is a key actually after they've they've rejected the gospel in 1950 after 1956 and he still says God loves America but he hates her sin all right so you know I'm I've been heavily emphasizing that as believers while we do love our country amen we love our flag we love our freedom we pray for our leaders but in a spiritual sense in a spiritual sense we're not Americans we are more than that we are Christians you understand so we're Christians so so we're we're not of this world's order if if they're if the testimony of your lived life as the Bible calls your chaste conversation if your testimony agrees with any portion of this world's system then you've got the wrong message there's something coming out of you that's not because the world system from top to bottom inside and out is contrary to the Word of God and so the real Christian is certainly different than the world now so there are no longer now here's something we know because as Jesus said in the Gospels as the Lightning travels out of the east even unto the West so shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man you can see that historically we've done it before we've studied the church ages and you know I say you say well do you believe that those angels that those were local churches in those seven churches agent of Asia Minor and that they were seven pastors to seven churches well of course there were seven churches there's a lot more than seven you understand I don't deny that but the greater implication that God was saying was to the church ages and that it that becomes it becomes silly to argue against that I've heard theologians try and and they try to argue it simply from the scripture and all you have to do is go back in history and look at the actual history of of the world coming from the early church in Jerusalem all the way up through the Roman Empire the collapse of the Roman Empire the Dark Ages coming out through through the gospel coming into Germany the inventing of the press and Martin Luther comes on the scene with the Reformation it jumps the channel hits England John Wesley rises up then that then it comes to America what's it doing it's coming west just like Jesus said it would do when you look at how history went and you take those prophecies and just overlay them on the history it just literally fits perfectly every point hits that is that is unmistakable it is unmistakable to anybody who will just look at the Bible plainly and not try to make it say something it's not saying and so so we find then that the gospel as its calm westward as Jesus said it would that every time a nation rejects it it moves on he drops a temporary judgment on that area and when you know and and I'm not here to preach on the ages today we know this is all rudimentary to us that we we find that it came to the west it came to America it's Revelation chapter 13 prophecies about America the beast that rose up out of the land not out of the water not in the old world it rose up out of the land where there was no people and there was just scattered native culture and so it rose up like a lamb under the under the pretense of godly and we had godly men we had true Christian character that's for real and God but you know as always a mixed multitude because you always had that even moses had that going out of the children taking children out of Egypt there's a mixed multitude you had believers make believers and unbelievers that's always the case and so here you've got our founding fathers trying to establish a constitution and Jefferson's writing a declaration of independence that is is thought by most scholars to be the greatest the greatest document concerning freedom of mankind that's ever been pinned now it's well thought of that but yet at the same time it's filled with flaws because you know there's slavery still being allowed and even Jefferson himself is having slaves I'm here to preach politics today I'm just saying this is our history because men his best effort with good motives and good intentions it's been a mixed bag and it's given mixed results and it can't last no nation can last they all end up collapsing and another world power comes in that's historically incontrovertible as well oh you look at Daniels prophecy and you can follow the Gentile kingdoms to a tee they literally describe the characteristics thousands of years in prophecy that you can read in history that happened thousands of years later and so so now we find then that that as each nation as the gospel kept coming west to this nation then this nation has a rejection of it what's it gonna do it goes back east again that's Bible prophecy why it's going back to the Jews it's going to go back and pick up the 144,000 out of Israel it's not going to convert the whole nation of Israel it's going to convert a very small they're just shy of nine million people and only a hundred and forty four thousand out of almost nine million are going ah with Moses and Elijah in into the new world into the Millennium alright I was going to crunch the number and do a percentage on that but I but I didn't do it but it's a very small percentage it's twelve thousand out of each tribe and and so Paul said remembered not all Israel's Israel but though just like all Christians aren't real Christians it's those who are born of the Spirit of God that's a Christian it's it's those who have the faith of Abraham that's a real Jew that's a true Israelite those with the faith of Abraham so as nations then every time a nation rejected it then judgment is on that nation it came to to Germany to England to here now and now all nations of the world have rejected God's message of their hour including this one and so we find out then that that all nations of the earth now there's a big statement all nations as a nation all nations are under judgment including Israel I know that might be foreign to you you might think wait a minute I thought Israel was being blessed of God not as a nation not as a nation there's true Israelites under there living in that system who are under the blessing of God just like you and me we're still here we're living in a curse that Israel was it trapped in Babylon 70 years Babylon was judged by God but yet God blessed his family and brought him out according to prophecy so God has restored Israel as a nation who did that God say well isn't that a blessing it is in a sense but you have to understand that the Jews as a nation when they rejected their Messiah they've been under the judgments of God ever since anything that you see them becoming a nation 48 the 67 war Yom Kippur War they've survived it all they're now a global power in the Middle East God is blessing them okay look friends you got under you got to separate what God does for prophecies sake God in 1957 this nation was sealed under judgment and as a nation she rejected him for the last time but his bride was still here the seal still had to come a prophet still had to go so he say man God is blessing us in that in that he is because his family is still here but as a nation we're not under his blessing as a nation Israel is not under his blessing they are not under his blessing until the gospel goes back to them when the day of the Gentiles is over and then then the bride is gone and then nobody other than those who are following Moses and Elijah are living under the blessing of God brother man talks about that uh and I'll just give you the reference the 70th week of Daniel he makes it very very clear you know and I'm just trying to save some time I got to go so quickly so we find that that if you want to read the 70 weeks of Daniel you can catch paragraph 97 through 101 and brother Branham teaches that very very clearly you can read it for yourself that they are as a nation under the judgment of God so so then I I've said so then I said talk about race relations and I've said you know in the family of God you know Paul said there's neither Jew nor Gentile there's neither bond nor free there is neither male or female so I'm not a race we've said that why is there no racism in the family of God and there isn't there isn't and through Holy Ghost field people there is none not a not a bit naughty not a sliver because the Holy Ghost would never tolerate that it wouldn't matter how you were raised what kind of background you had or what you how you'd been brainwashed when you get the Holy Ghost you are a brand new creature in Christ all old things are passed away and so when you when the Holy Ghost is on display there is no racism because you're no longer a race you're a child of God it's like I'm not exactly an American I'm a Christian I'm not a race I'm a child of God you understand I'm not a politic we've said that we're not Republicans Democrats libertarians are even independence we bear no political identity or social identity of this world's order at all Paul says you're not of them you're you're of the day you're not of the night the world moves in those things we do our mission here is to try to try to show the gospel to everybody we can and say come up out of that world system order it's only chaos it's only getting worse you can't fix it by passing new laws you can't fix it by spending more money it doesn't matter who you elect the world is ending jesus said it must there's a rapture the good news is you don't have to be in a tribulation Christ is coming to take a bride out of the earth so so so in that vein then so we're not a political identity we're not a social identity I'm not a racial identity we are we are the global bride family of Jesus Christ and our citizenship and our full allegiance is to God you understand we preach to all we try to compel all we pray for all so so we find then that that why do I keep emphasizing you might ask brother Jason's four weeks in a row why do you keep emphasizing and touching on these polarizing political and social issues and this that our nation is facing here's why I've been preaching to you about being the final voice to the final age once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost so therefore it's and I and I said for me it's a lot to do with preaching words because I'm a preacher but all of you are preachers to a degree all of you have a voice of your life and the world needs to hear that voice because right now right now listen friends according to the Bible you believe the Bible according to Bible teaching at the end of the world we are that that that according to Bible teaching at the end of the world only the Bride of Christ who have received the revelation of the restorer word are even qualified to speak to inequities only according to Bible teaching the the Bride of Christ around the world not just Americans around the world we are aware that that you say well you think you're in well I think I'm part of that group I know for sure that prophecy is that only that group whoever it is if it's not me there is somebody whoever that group is they are the only ones qualified to speak truth to inequities because everybody else can't reason they lose their ability to discern right from wrong according to Bible prophecy the only way that you can find true legitimacy in any truth is when you have the mind of Christ can't be man's opinion you can't go on something that sounds nice only the mind of Christ every other opinion outside of the mind of Christ is illegitimate now how important they only think of this friends that if you believe you're in that number of the less JOHN CARTER the elect lady and she's prophesied to go in a rapture she's prophesied to have the mind of Christ right at the end then only that family only that selected elected family of God who have accepted the message and have been baptized in the Holy Ghost and who have the token on display there are the only ones who can speak truth to injustice now how important is your life lived by the control of the Holy Spirit if the world can't hear it from you there's no other resources they have say well they got their Bibles and that's why we have thirty thousand different denominations because this can't be discerned by the human mind Jesus taught us that Jesus said it's not revealed you can't this is a this a locked up book it's written in a way that it can't you can't get the whole picture you can probe at it you can come up with some truth something close and kind of look like it and men have done that and thank God for it but but we've had many many errors and that's the only time it was ever taught perfectly was when Paul and the disciples and the apostles were teaching it and that's why God said now they're gonna lose that it's gonna go off in the Dark Ages I'm gonna give an extra grade of mercy because you you can't disbelieve what you don't know and it's not gonna be revealed so I'm gonna weaken a lot of ignorance and a lot of God's family went to heaven even even with misunderstandings of his word but he promised in the last day I'm gonna completely restore it back I'm gonna send a messenger and he'll have the opening of the seals it'll be fed to the people and now the world can hear once more direct from God as at Pentecost that's what this message is all about so only the Bride of Christ sealed by the original token they're the only people who are fully qualified to speak to injustice because everything else is a mixed multitude so now so now when we start talking in global understanding like that then then now we move beyond nationalism and American pride you understand as I said I love America I'm glad I'm here if push comes to shove this is my nation I would fight and die for it to protect its freedoms I would do it tomorrow my dad served in the military I would take my place you understand great men of God have taken their place I would do it today but this moves beyond American pride this moves beyond a national spirit this message first of all you need to understand this message has gone around the world this is a global bride a global people and inspiring people who are capable of receiving inspiration you have to be elected to that God you have a gene inside you are that's a receiving set that can hear that word of God you you hear man-made systems of religion none of its quite right your things you appreciate about it I like this movement that denomination this church it's all seems pretty good but there's too much of it I don't know it does it just seemed like surely there's more how many times have I heard the testimony people have come to this message and said you know I tried this one in this church in that church in this denomination that independent this one over here my mama said this my daddy said this and the preacher said this and but I just knew somehow there had to be more there just had to be more somewhere there had to be more and then they heard an Eagle scream oh my and inspiring people capable of being inspired now that that's what the word inspire Abul means not has a two-part meaning i want you to get this in spiral because inspiration for this word only comes to the inspiring jesus gave that in the india and the parable of some seed falls by the wayside some seed falls among stony ground some seed falls among thorns this is all humanity represented there and he's giving the gospel to the wayside it meant nothing the fouls come the demons come to take it away they don't even care they're indifferent to the truth you say well was Jesus being selective Jesus was just an all-knowing with his omniscience he knew that was going to be the case and so he tells it in advance here's what's gonna happen you're gonna go and you're gonna preach the gospel to every creature you're gonna teach all of them nations baptizing them in my name but but understand that to a large part of them is gonna be seed at the wayside just letting you know now so you don't get discouraged there's gonna be some who like stony ground they hear it they are non with joy but because the ground that because it's soil a thin layer of soil on top of rock and therefore whatever grows can't put in deep roots and so the only thing that can grow there is something in in the shade moss and things like that little small plants but but but any but if the Sun comes up and beams down hard on that heats up that rock underneath there that thing's gonna wilt and die because it doesn't have deep soil to put its roots down and you follow me and so Jesus is saying that there's gonna be some people who hear the gospel and anon with joy but by and by because of persecution they become offended they forget they get offended at the word it's too straight for me I don't want to live like that well if you don't want to be a Christian then you shouldn't try you shouldn't even try and and and you know I say why are you a Christian because I want to be because I love holiness I love righteous what has done that to me was I born that way goodness no I was born a filthy sinner I was born with every desire of the world dislike Paul said we all had our conversation at one time it but but then when God revealed himself to me I wasn't that way side or that stoning ground or those thorns I was the good ground say how do you know cuz I'm a believer and I it's of no merit of my own it's not because I was smarter because I was better I was neither but God rich in mercy oh my but now watch this because so inspiring means a capable of being inspired but the other the other half of it is fit for inspiration that is to say wow while it is still in spiral it is inspiring with a sense of responsibility a lot of people come under the inspiration of the word they never adopt a sense of responsibility they feel no responsibility at all there's even people set right in message churches and you watch their lives they never really take on the responsibility of what it means to to stand with the to stand with the body of Christ and be different they believe the doctrines they're convinced of the teachings they don't want to go to hell they don't want to go on a tribulation so they they they stay in this quagmire this no-man's land always going around never really getting rooted never really growing I'm not saying that children of God I'm just saying that even as a child of God you still got to accept him you've still got to allow him to change life and you got to allow him to be the to be the Lord over your life he's never going to force himself on you Jesus Christ you know that that's a term women appreciate you know a woman walking in a dark alley and suddenly a strange man steps out if he's a he's a gentleman she has no fear he would never touch her because he's a gentleman he would never force himself on her but if he's not a gentleman she's got a problem if he thinks he can get away with something so brother Ram says Jesus Christ is a perfect gentleman he will never force himself on you he won't force you to be a Christian he will liberate you and allow you to love being a Christian he will change your inside heart and you will never it's not about it's not about quitting things it's about you know say well I don't know if I can quit this I don't know if I can quit that I don't I kind of like doing this it's not even about that I you know I I just say if you just can fall in love with him I promise you those those desires will go away you won't care - oh my there there's no there's I don't struggle to not go to the bars I don't struggle to to run around and and lascivious lifestyle I don't struggle I I love righteousness I love being a Christian my mind my trauma comes when I fail to be when I slip and make a mistake down on my knees I go how many believers believe it like that down on my knees I don't want to be that Lord see so it's somebody who's fit for inspiration there's a sense of responsibility it's a people capable of receiving the signal of Revelation that comes down from God's throne it's an elected people an elected people to hear the revelation can I say it this way not just to hear the revelation but to become the revelation otherwise hear me otherwise it's just doctrine it's just teaching that you agree with that's not the new birth it's not the new birth Satan a Great Satan knows this is true he knows the will of God but he refuses to do it he's not he believes but he does he's not converted by that he knows who God is he knows God's never failed that doesn't make him converted listen friends it's not just about being convinced of its teaching but it's not about believing the word only it's becoming the words all purpose of the Holy Ghost is to anoint from within you a word of the message that you hear and the Holy Ghost its to omnipotence meet and you become a child of God and the world hears direct from God again through you through your life I got to close here in a second give me eight minutes so the masterpiece brother Branham says a beautiful sermon Wow I love that sermon July 5 1964 prophet says but the great sculptor took a prophet to see this the great sculptor when he seen the fall of his family now he's back in our text now he's back in Genesis where we started the great sculptor when he's seen the fall of his family the masterpiece he wasn't willing just to leave it lay there face down in ruin he went to work immediately to build it up again listen here's his heart here's the heart of God he wasn't willing that it should perish lay there like that all for all time because he's God and he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately and begin to build it back unto his own image oh I'm so thankful he didn't leave me laying there face down howl oh you're friends he wouldn't leave me laying there he wouldn't leave you he wouldn't leave his his creation laying there listen let me say this to you it's like why as I come to a close I got out another clip I want to play you and we'll end with this if you're the quote I just read where he talks about when he's seen the fall of his family the masterpiece he wasn't willing to just leave it laying there facedown in ruin he went to work immediately to build it up again he wasn't willing that it should perish lay there like that for all time be he's God he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately to begin to build it again into his own image that's why he gave Adam and Eve skins because it spoke of a he God slew the first lamb he gave them skins bloody skins their fig leaves of manmade religion couldn't cover them it took blood and God was in doing that speaking of the Lamb of God that in thousands of years the Lamb of God would be hung on a tree and that Lamb of God would be the atonement in the propitiation not only the atonement but the total satisfaction because Mara I've taught you on that he wasn't just the atoning he didn't just expiate your sin and make you sinless in the presence of God because if he only did that as soon as you sinned again you'd be right back in the lurch right back in jail you follow me so he expiated all of your past sins but he also knowing that you're a frail human being that you're gonna make mistakes that you're like you lied to the Bible says a man of like passions you've got your ups and downs then Jesus also lived the preceptive side of God's commandment remember precept upon precept line upon line Jesus lived every precept of God on my behalf so that when I failed to do it I still get credit for doing it because he did it in my stead he's not just my atonement he's my total satisfaction he expiated all my past expiated my fallen birth the way I came into the world born in sin X baited me of all of that because he was the atoning lamb his blood did that but he also satisfied the preceptive side of God's laws and lived it on my behalf therefore therefore when I do make a mistake and I do therefore when you make a mistake and you understand then you can then you say done finished well you could be finished if it wasn't for Paul writing to you in the book of Romans and telling you under inspiration there is their noun there is now therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus Paul Paul made it so clear Paul said it's not either died I'm not the one died Christ died how are you gonna accuse me I'm not the one saying this he's the one did it he's the one who gave me his life he's the one who said there's no condemnation because you've passed Jesus said in Saint John 5 you've passed from death to life you can never come into the judgment blessed be the name of the Lord so here when a prophet says immediately to build it back up again he wasn't willing that it should perish lay there like that for all time because he's God and he will not be defeated he went to work immediately and began to build it again unto his own image you know something friends manure sinful life and failures mean they mean nothing to you then this quote means nothing to you if say that again here I'm reading a prophet saying he went to work immediately you were you had no chance you were laying facedown his masterpiece was ruined but he wouldn't leak he wouldn't leave it that way he started building it back immediately you know something if your if your sinful life and your failures mean nothing to you then that quote no matter how beautiful it is means nothing to you but for those who don't want sin it's everything for those who don't want to be sinful for those who lament their weaknesses how many I got in here today say I don't want to be sinful I lament my weaknesses those who weep over their failures this quote is everything it means everything to me because I can see that jesus promised what he would do and he's done it inside my life oh it means everything to me friends I have the weapon I love all men if you weren't here Wednesday night if you hadn't heard that sermon and I've been telling you you know that if you are manooj us stream that
