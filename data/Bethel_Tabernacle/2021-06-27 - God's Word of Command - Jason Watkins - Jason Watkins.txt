TRANSCRIPT
========================================
merely you know a prophecy that would later be understood you know as the oil represented the holy ghost and the wine represented stimulation from revelation but actually it's more than just a prophecy for future understanding it's actually a word of command the same creative word uh that had spoken the heavens and the earth into existence and brought light out of nothing amen so it because it was that then there was no way that the enemy would ever be able to stop it regardless of what it looked like in real time no matter what when it's spoken here in this age to the church we find that under that black horse rider under that third seal you know he had had the effects of the white horse of deception and now it was teamed up with the red horse of martyrdom and tyranny and slaughter now teamed up with the black horse and he takes the bibles and makes a one one uh universal church and only the preachers only the the the clergy have the word of god and and he's oppressing by laws and putting people to death but god is simply saying you know satan it doesn't matter what you do you're not going to prevent me from my oil and wine because it looked like if you just read it on the surface of the scripture it looks like the devil just flaunting what god said god said hey don't touch that oil and wine and the devil goes right in and takes the word of god from them and began it looks like wow the devil just ignoring god but he's not because what god was saying at a deeper level is there was going to be suffering and those horse riders were going to look like they had success but regardless of however much success they would have nothing could stop god from revealing himself through his messenger to his people and they would get a dip of the holy ghost and be brought into the first resurrection so that he was able to lay his bride away in sleep with every age and there was nothing that satan can do and whatever it looked like he was doing was not stopping that because why touch not my oil and wine was a word of command that it was part of god's word and had to come to pass now when we look in job let's look at job our next slide i think i have it in the in the powerpoint so job 3 2 3-6 and the lord said unto satan has thou considered my servant job that there's none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth god and issue with evil this is even before the holy ghost is given all right so i mean there's a way to to learn the the bible talks about even nature teaches us certain things about righteousness and we're made in the image of god so we come with a conscious to not lie to not steal to not kill we know to not do that see so we find then that he says he issue with evil and still he holdeth fast his integrity although thou movest me against him to destroy him without cause and satan answered the lord and said skin for skin yea all that a man hath will he give for his life but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse thee to thy face and the lord said unto satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life now here's a word of command the lord is saying i'm going to give you permission you you already have brought every kind of calamity on him because you challenged me and and now he's held his integrity and now you're saying oh if i touch his flesh well have at it but save his life so now we realize then that we we tend to think if we just read on the surface kind of like in the third seal if we just read touch n you know touch not the oil in the wine it looks like satan touched it plenty but actually god wasn't saying you're not going to be able to come against it he was simply saying my word is still going to prevail and so when he says to job you can have at him but you cannot take his life save his life so it in our when we read it from the surface it looks like that job was quite protected that would be the sense that we would get wow praise the lord job is protected satan can't take his life but i'm going to tell you something friends in the midst of his day-to-day life with all of his calamities i doubt job felt very protected i doubt very seriously that if job went around saying wow i've got this wonderful protection from the lord i think he probably felt there's anything but protection on my life but there was a mystery unfolding because a conversation had taken place in heaven a challenge had been thrown down by satan and god had taken the challenge just like in arkansas remember when the maniac jumped on the platform said i'll knock you out into that audi middle of that audience and brother branham said he was well able to do it his towering man brother branham was a small man about 145 pounds and and he said he was well able to do it but he says but the but the anointing came on brother branham says because you've challenged the servant of the most high god you'll fall at my feet so i'll show you whose feet all fall out and he went to swing and and the brother and said come out of him satan and he whirled around and his eyes rolled back and he collapsed on his feet and they had to pry him off of his brother ram's feet brother branham explains it that satan made a challenge and the holy ghost accepted the challenge oh i want to tell you something friends today there's a there's a war going on in another realm and angels are moving to interdict on behalf of your life don't ever doubt that that god remains in control of our lives but we find that job was unaware of any of this god didn't run ahead and uh you know ahead of satan and warned job he didn't even send an angel he didn't even give him a dream like he did joseph in the days of the young child jesus remember he come to him in a dream says take the child and flee because herod's trying to kill him and so we realized that god didn't do that he job was caught completely unaware but job but god knew that job would hold on and that job would pass the test but there's but i want to point out to you today that there's more in that mix than just for knowledge it wasn't just that god you know can look back and sit back and see see how it all works out and by his foreknowledge he knows job's going to hold he knows you know god is literally proving to satan a kingdom principle that someday he he's going to live inside of his people and god is going to accomplish his will just like he did in jesus only in mrs jesus and that mrs jesus will be a continuation of mr jesus and so he god is now giving a word of command don't touch his life so we realize that god in this awareness remember that jesus remember that jesus brother branham says in is your life worthy of the gospel and he says jesus never screamed at devils because he didn't he didn't have to he never felt the need to do that he said he just spoke because and they fled and he said jesus knew here's what he knew he knew two things one was based on the other he knew as a man as a result that his word couldn't fail and he knew as a cause of that was he knew who he was see so his his revelation of who he was this is why brother branham would say what is the new birth he said it is a revelation of jesus christ personally to you so it is god is giving you to understand who you are job didn't understand all of his circumstances and in fact is if you follow the story job continues to hold continues to hold even his wife turns against him and he says woman you speak like a foolish woman she said oh curse god and die you speak like a foolish woman and the three wit his three friends you know miserable comforters he said you're all miserable comforters and they're they're trying to accuse him and he he can't make sense of everything he knows he hasn't done anything wrong and he knows god is just and he won't let that slip he won't let the devil tell him he's guilty of something he knows he's not guilty of and he won't defy god because he knows that god is just in all things and so based on that job his revelation that far thus far was holding him now i'm going to tell you something friends brother branham said you know you should pray for revelation above all things because when god reveals his word to you you can make sense sometimes of your life which doesn't make a lot of sense sometimes we go through things and joel was going through things and and and right at the point where job you know where satan is making a very true statement no no this last stage he'll curse you see satan knows mankind he knows that man can only hold so far until god increases the revelation and when god comes down to job what does he do he comes just in time to say job where were you when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy as i've preached to you before god's not being you know he's not he's not browbeating job he's not being a smart aleck he's giving job a revelation job where do you think you were before the morning when the morning star is saying do you think you started here job i'm here to tell you when sons of god shattered for joy job your identity's back there and that's when job could rise up and it didn't matter satan had done his worst and yet job could rise up and say i know my redeemer liveth and at the last day i'll see him and with my own eyes i'll see him amen so job knew it didn't even matter what happened in this life even if his life went to the grave he knew that he would resurrect and see god in his flesh with his own human eyes see so so we realize this principle of god's word of command that that is wrapped up you know in the identity so jesus knowing who he was and you know i i've often thought about how that and my monitors are getting a little hot brothers i've often thought about how that that jesus as a as a 12 year old boy and he's confounding the doctors in the temple and i i've often wondered when he when he turned to isaiah and he read all we like sheep have gone astray and god had laid on him the iniquity of us all and he was led as a you know dumb as a lamb he opened not his mouth led to the slaughter i wonder how old jesus was as a boy when he opened those verses and read them and it dawned on him that's me this is me this is my life i'm here to tell you something friends by that by the time he's entering into his ministry he doesn't have to scream at devils he already knows who he is god has already identified him this is my beloved son make no doubt this is my beloved son inside of whom i'm dwelling and pleased to be here see and so jesus with the with the strength knowing that knowing watch now because here's here's a real point that i want to make knowing not only that who he that that not only that god's word of command couldn't fail because he's god and his word can't fail that he had that knowledge god's word can't fail but jesus also began to realize that he was the word of command as a human he was that same word that's why john says in the beginning was god with god and was god that logos and jesus knew i am merely an expression of that same word of command i can't be stopped and that's a revelation your confidence just isn't in god it's in the identity of who you are that you realize i'm a continuation of the word of command i can't be stopped there's nothing it doesn't matter what's happening in my life i'm sorry to be preaching on a sunday school class it doesn't matter what's happening in my life i'm a word of command i am the word and a human i'm the extension i'm the continuation of that same ministry that dwelt in jesus and by that revelation not only was his confidence in god that's where job job already had confidence in god but when job began to realize who he was and what that actually meant then he realized that his word that his life can't be stopped that satan can't can't prevent him from going forward i'm here to tell you something friends that was under the third seal that was under a black horse rider and and now we have the pale horse riding which is a which is a conglomeration of the white horse the red horse the black horse all combined and you say this world is impossible and rightly so because we have the convergence of the days of noah and the days of lot we have 6 000 years that satan has had to build his eden so now it's satan's eden we have satan according to paul in this age who's now the god of this evil age worshipped as the god people in churches singing the songs of zion don't realize according to scripture they're worshiping the devil because they've given their life over to him and they've missed the revelation of the word of the hour to them personally which would have given them the right kind of worship and so here you are today and i know a pale horse rider and i know the world's crazy and i know it's it's breaking apart at the seams but i'm here to tell you god released an eagle anointing in this hour to lift us up above the shadows you can't survive in the darkness why it's too dark it's impossible get out of there let the eagle anointing lift you up into the light of god's word see because that's where our strength is that's how we are continuing to be the word made flesh jesus just as jesus was the fullness of the godhead in a single human body now that same god is now manifested in the fullness of his word in a mini-membered body many member body so you have mr jesus mrs jesus as the bride would call as the as as the bible would call her the bride of christ see she and and she's born of his bone flesh of his flesh these two shall be one amen and so so we realize then that that we're we're looking at this world and we can't just look at it on the surface you can't just look at your life on the surface you can't just look at trials and tribulations and even sometimes your own human failures and you say i'm never going to make it can i use my double negative you can't not make it you can't not believe because why because you're smart no i i can figure out the message of this hour because i'm intelligent enough no has nothing to do with it it has to be a revelation of god not just revealing theology to you but revealing to you you're part of that word and that you and that's why satan can't stop you touch not the oil and the wine it's a word of command god is going to have a bride he's already foretold it he's going to he sent a word that would gather her around the world and it's happened say can you explain it to me here's what i can explain an eagle screamed and i heard it and i've gathered around the carcass of the word today yeah but you're a minority well i can't explain that seem like to me the whole world should believe this they don't but i know that i believe it and there's nothing that the enemy is going to do in this day in this life i don't care how dreadful it becomes that's going to there's no way that he's going to be able to destroy the revelation in my heart and there's no way he's going to dislodge my position as a son of god and in this i have confidence say how do you know that you will always be a son of god because i'm part of the word of command see that has to come to pass brother branham finishes with this with this quote from the sumerian church age do we have that josh i think we raced through job let's see let's start it right there now watch brother brahm says in the sumerian church age i know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief shepherd of the flock i got to hurry chief shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation look at history did he no 68 million were martyred 68 million has a minimum well some estimates are 120 million christians down through seven church ages were martyred for the cause of christ by an entity calling itself the church so a group calling itself the true church slaughtered the true church see so so so we find he says here so does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says i know your tribulation i'm not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block that is to so many people like israel they wonder if god really loves them how can god be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer that is what they asked in malachi 1 1-3 the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi i have loved you saith the lord yet you say wherein has thou loved us look at this well and god hears god's answer was not he saw jacob's brother saith the lord yet i love jacob and i hated his soul and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness you see they could not figure out god's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant like a baby with parental care but god said that his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened amen just think of that no matter what happened his uh his love was proven truly by the fact they they were chosen unto salvation because as the scripture says god hath chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as job said he put strength in us in job 23. you see himself suffered this is christ himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered hebrews 5 8-9 though he were a son yet learned the obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him in plain language the very character of jesus was perfected by suffering and according to paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in god while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection he he why did he want this james 1 2-4 my brethren count it all joy when ye shall fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience you have to let it you have to allow it see or you can get bent and twisted complexed it's your choice but james is saying let patience have her perfect work see that you may be perfect an entire wanting nothing i want to tell you something friends no matter what happens to us in our day you can take that down brother josh no matter what happens to us in our day the creative word of command stands sure and i'm here to tell you we don't know how much more crazy the world will become how much more twisted or perverted i can't imagine it could be more than it already is where mankind as a specie has lost his ability to discern between right and wrong that's prophecy that he said that would happen and it's happened but i know this that i have a divine word of command that assures me that even if he commits me to death as he did paul if he commits me to suffering as he did job nevertheless paul said second timothy 2 19 nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his amen are you glad to be his today amen thank you for coming out to the sunday school class amen we'll have our intermission and we'll get started here with the regular service uh casey good to see you and your friend there glad to have them here with us today god bless you it's seeing us a little bit you
