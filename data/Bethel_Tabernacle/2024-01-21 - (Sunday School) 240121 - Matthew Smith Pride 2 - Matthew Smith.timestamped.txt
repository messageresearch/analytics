[0:01] all right good morning everybody let's
[0:03] all stand and have a word of
[0:06] prayer oh gracious
[0:09] father Lord we come together more than
[0:13] just two or three in this house father
[0:16] gathered in your name and so Lord we're
[0:18] inviting you and we we know that you
[0:21] always come when you're invited so
[0:24] father Lord we ask you would come down
[0:26] and bless the few words that I have Lord
[0:29] that
[0:31] father that you could speak through me
[0:32] that I it wouldn't just be me producing
[0:35] some words or some ideas that I would
[0:37] have but Lord that it would be you
[0:38] speaking through
[0:39] me father that I'd be able to step out
[0:42] of the way and put aside any any feeling
[0:44] that I would have any any nervousness or
[0:48] or or some idea or
[0:50] some some interpretation that I would
[0:53] have but father that it would be you
[0:55] speaking only what you would have
[0:58] said father that the people people's
[1:00] hearts would be open they could they
[1:02] could not simply have some dead letter
[1:06] on a page but Lord that it would become
[1:08] real to them that they could take it and
[1:10] live it and that become a a manifested
[1:14] word so father we we know that it is
[1:18] your will to do all of these things and
[1:22] we ask them in the name of the Lord
[1:24] Jesus Christ
[1:26] amen um so I want to this morning Take A
[1:30] Part Two to to last week for those of
[1:32] you who were here
[1:35] um I'll do a for those of you who
[1:37] weren't or for those of you here who are
[1:38] here don't quite remember um I'm going
[1:41] to do a quick a quick summary of um of
[1:45] some of the points that I made last
[1:47] time and um before we do that we'll go
[1:49] ahead and read a scripture so youall can
[1:52] be seated um let's turn to Jeremiah
[1:54] chapter
[1:56] 2 and
[1:58] um
[2:01] if I can it
[2:03] is and we'll start at verse
[2:09] one and I'll wait
[2:12] for I have the benefit of having
[2:14] everything already saved on a
[2:18] device um it
[2:20] says um Jeremiah chapter 2 and verse
[2:26] one says moreover the word of the Lord
[2:30] came to me
[2:32] saying go and cry in the ears of
[2:34] Jerusalem
[2:35] saying thus sayith the Lord I remember
[2:38] Thee the kindness of thy youth the love
[2:40] of thine espousals when thou wentest
[2:42] after me in the wilderness in a land
[2:44] that was not sown Israel was Holiness
[2:47] unto the Lord and the first fruits of
[2:49] his increase all that devour him shall
[2:51] offend evil shall come upon them sayith
[2:53] the
[2:55] Lord and we'll we'll be
[2:58] seated
[3:05] so I'm want to try to very quickly
[3:06] summarize um last week um and I'm just
[3:10] going to read a couple a couple things I
[3:12] had written down in my notes that kind
[3:14] of summarized
[3:16] um uh what we had said so to start with
[3:21] um to I I said to sort of if we could
[3:24] encapsulate the entire message of the
[3:26] hour of today uh we could say it like
[3:28] this perhaps um that the message of this
[3:31] hour is that God has come again to the
[3:34] Earth in human form and he looks like us
[3:37] right that that it would be God the Holy
[3:40] Spirit descending on people remaining in
[3:43] them and operating through them that
[3:44] their nature would be changed and that
[3:46] would be God living through them and and
[3:47] because they have the nature of God they
[3:49] would do the works of God right they
[3:51] would they would live like God would
[3:52] live they would do what God would
[3:55] do um and um I there's a you know we
[4:00] showed a sort of a type of how Jesus had
[4:03] you know the Holy Ghost descends on
[4:04] Jesus in the form of a dove at the River
[4:06] Jordan and now and that you know he he
[4:09] being perfect that the Holy Ghost
[4:11] descended and remained upon him and then
[4:13] when he dies that the Holy Ghost ascends
[4:15] to heaven and then descends again on the
[4:17] day of Pentecost onto the people amen
[4:19] and that once it descends upon the
[4:21] people then they start to doing the same
[4:23] works that Jesus did when he was on the
[4:25] earth to that and so that indicates that
[4:27] the same Jesus was alive again in them
[4:31] okay and that the same holy ghost that
[4:34] was alive and and working through the PE
[4:37] the the church at Pentecost was the same
[4:39] Holy Ghost working through William
[4:42] brandham here on Earth again because
[4:45] he's doing the exact same works again
[4:46] it's an indication of of the same life
[4:50] right and that to take it a step farther
[4:52] you
[4:53] know I I want to articulate it like this
[4:57] maybe that you know there's Christ the
[5:00] man and there's the Holy Ghost kind of
[5:03] on top of that um and brother brand
[5:06] talks about Jesus at at the tomb that he
[5:08] would cry and that that that when he
[5:09] would cry that would be a man but when
[5:10] he said Lazarus come forth that would be
[5:12] more than a man right um again you have
[5:16] say I I would kind of maybe take a
[5:18] different angle on it um that when Jesus
[5:22] goes to a well in Samaria and he's
[5:24] asking for a drink because he's thirsty
[5:26] he's that's the man asking for a drink
[5:28] but when he tells the woman at the well
[5:30] everything that she had done that was
[5:31] more than a man right when William
[5:35] brandom is depressed and is having
[5:38] because his wife and baby died and he's
[5:40] having a mental breakdown and ready to
[5:41] blow his brains out that's William
[5:43] brandom the man but when he turns his
[5:45] back on a crowd and starts telling
[5:46] people the things that he had done that
[5:48] he' never met before that's not a man
[5:51] that's more than a man right and to take
[5:54] it a step
[5:55] further the things that happen in my
[5:58] life you know you know if we leave the
[6:01] Holy Ghost on brother Brandon and we're
[6:02] missing what's happening in our day I
[6:05] personally have
[6:07] experienced where it's not just William
[6:10] brand telling people the things they had
[6:12] done I've met God in the back room of
[6:14] this very building in which Jason
[6:17] Watkins told me the things that I had
[6:18] done in a conversation that he was had
[6:20] no part of that IID had the day before
[6:23] and I met God and it wasn't because of
[6:25] Jason Watkins I mean I'm sure our
[6:27] pastors has faults and failures just
[6:29] like everybody else things he's not
[6:30] proud of but when he told me direct
[6:33] quotations from a conversation that i'
[6:35] had the day before that he had no part
[6:37] of that was more than a man
[6:40] right anytime you have a minister
[6:43] standing in the Pulpit telling you know
[6:44] preaching the word and the word begins
[6:46] to deal with things that you you know
[6:50] that preacher has no idea what he's what
[6:52] he's saying and yet he's saying exactly
[6:54] what you needed to hear that's not just
[6:56] a man standing there okay that's more
[6:59] than a
[7:02] man so uh to take it a step further says
[7:07] um but the again this is from last week
[7:10] that anytime you have a holy the Holy
[7:12] Spirit on the scene you have the devil
[7:15] presenting a counterfeit right it'll
[7:17] look so close that it'll deceive the
[7:18] very that it would deceive the very
[7:20] elect if that were possible but it it
[7:23] would look it would look close it would
[7:24] even be able to identify itself with the
[7:26] message yah looked at Cain how he would
[7:28] even name his own children
[7:30] Enoch as a as a as a as a a mimic of the
[7:34] true of of the actual Son of God named
[7:36] Enoch right there was a genuine Son of
[7:38] God named Enoch and the devil the this
[7:41] the serpent seed would would would try
[7:43] to identify himself with the raptured
[7:45] church for their for his day
[7:48] right
[7:51] um and but the the true Mark of the
[7:54] false seed of that serpent seed that
[7:55] Antichrist seed is that it can't be
[7:58] corrected that that it would where it
[8:00] would come off the word of God when when
[8:02] there would become a a a a conflict
[8:04] between the word of God and the desires
[8:07] of your heart if you're not willing to
[8:09] come under the correction of the word of
[8:12] God that's the Antichrist Spirit
[8:16] right um and so we moved on into
[8:21] um uh into Esther and it and we we
[8:25] talked about um Esther under the the
[8:27] ministry of Hagi teaching her to please
[8:31] the king in what she would do right and
[8:33] that there we had a Hagi in our day
[8:34] dressing the bride of Christ to meet her
[8:37] groom
[8:39] um and it says um I just wrote here it
[8:42] says if the true bride of Christ do only
[8:44] that which pleases the father because
[8:46] she has the nature of Christ in her the
[8:48] question becomes apparent how can we
[8:50] know what pleases the father God always
[8:53] sends his will for each age by the mouth
[8:55] of a single messenger so that the people
[8:57] can avoid confusion and ignorance
[9:00] Esther pleased the King by following the
[9:02] instructions of hagi hagi was the
[9:05] mouthpiece of the king to the women to
[9:07] instruct them on what pleased the
[9:10] king it says when he gave instruction to
[9:13] the women it was not simply his opinion
[9:15] or an educated guest he was the
[9:16] mouthpiece of the king there to convey
[9:18] the desires of the king to the women to
[9:21] disregard his teachings is simply an
[9:23] opinion showed that they could not be
[9:25] conformed to the will of the king
[9:26] because of their pride amen okay
[9:29] to ignore his teachings showed that they
[9:31] were made of the same material as vashy
[9:35] who also refused the word of the king
[9:36] that had come to her at the mouth of the
[9:38] king's seven
[9:41] chamberlains okay and that ultimately
[9:44] that all the women es Esther and all the
[9:46] other women who were going before the
[9:48] king all had a sensation they might have
[9:50] all jumped and shouted at a Revival
[9:52] meeting they might have all they all
[9:53] came under the same sanctification
[9:56] process they might have all been under
[9:58] the same Ministry of the same Messenger
[10:01] right that even even people under the
[10:04] under the ministry of William
[10:07] brandom can all at some point choose to
[10:13] disregard the teachings of that
[10:15] messenger in order to please their own
[10:16] desires and ultimately be
[10:19] rejected
[10:21] okay and so that's that's kind of where
[10:24] we where we
[10:25] ended so um man I am the worst about
[10:29] taking a a summary and making it way too
[10:35] long
[10:37] um so it says I want to so I want to
[10:40] start here in Jeremiah chapter 2 so with
[10:41] all this in mind I want to just take one
[10:44] key point one key takeaway that I want
[10:46] to really highlight is that
[10:49] there there was these PE these women in
[10:52] in in the Book of Esther where they're
[10:54] all looking to have receive something
[10:56] from the King they're all looking to be
[10:58] the king's bride
[10:59] they were all under the same
[11:00] sanctification they might have all
[11:01] cleaned their life up in a similar way
[11:04] they might have all been under the same
[11:05] Ministry they all had an experience with
[11:08] the king in a fa a to a fashion right
[11:11] they all met the king at some point and
[11:13] they all had some sort of relationship
[11:16] there but the king only stayed with one
[11:18] in particular and that was the one that
[11:22] anytime that the king's desires came in
[11:25] contrast to her desires she turned aside
[11:29] from what she wanted and did only that
[11:30] which the king wanted
[11:33] okay and ultimately that it was that it
[11:36] was the it was where the king remained
[11:40] right that that you could have an
[11:41] experience and not actually have
[11:45] God
[11:47] okay so I want to start here in Jeremiah
[11:50] chapter 2 and it says um you know where
[11:52] we read there says um go and cry in the
[11:54] ears of Jerusalem saying thus sayith the
[11:55] Lord I remember Thee the kindness of thy
[11:57] youth the love of thy espousals when
[11:59] thou wentest after me in the wilderness
[12:00] in a land that was not sown Israel's
[12:02] Holiness under the Lord and the first
[12:03] fruits of his increase all that devour
[12:06] him shall offend evil shall come unto
[12:07] them sayeth the Lord hear ye the word of
[12:09] the Lord oh House of Jacob and all the
[12:10] families of the House of Israel thus
[12:13] saith oh actually hang on I'm going I
[12:14] want to back up and and put some
[12:16] emphasis on this so it says hear ye the
[12:17] word of the Lord oh House of Jacob and
[12:20] all the families of the House of Israel
[12:22] okay so I want to emphasize here that
[12:23] it's speaking directly to the families
[12:25] okay that this is a family level thing
[12:27] this is not a nationwide problem this is
[12:28] a on the level of individual households
[12:31] okay because a nation is made up of
[12:32] families and likewise a church is made
[12:33] up of individual families okay and
[12:36] ultimately the family is made up of
[12:38] individuals so each individual is
[12:40] contributing to that family and likewise
[12:42] the family contributes to a church if if
[12:45] individual families no longer hold to
[12:48] the word of God then ultimately the
[12:50] entire church falls apart the entire
[12:51] church is no longer holding the word of
[12:53] God it really boils down to don't sit
[12:56] around waiting for another person or
[12:58] another family or another people in
[13:00] other people in your church to rise
[13:03] higher the solution is that you rise
[13:06] higher yourself take on of yourself you
[13:10] do that which you need to do and when
[13:12] everybody gets on that same page gets in
[13:14] that one mind in that Accord then you'll
[13:17] see Revival
[13:18] okay um it says um so it's but it's so
[13:21] it's to individual families it says thus
[13:23] sayith the Lord what iniquity have your
[13:26] fathers found in me that they are gone
[13:28] far from me and have walked after vanity
[13:30] and be are become vain okay so this is
[13:33] to fathers this is to dads and husbands
[13:36] okay this is to heads of households amen
[13:40] and it says um to walk after vanity and
[13:42] or become vain that word vanity would
[13:44] maybe more translate into more
[13:45] contemporary English as
[13:47] worthless that you have walked after
[13:49] worthlessness and are become
[13:52] worthless okay that it's just you you
[13:54] you're seeking after that the heads of
[13:56] households are seeking after worthless
[13:59] nonsense worthless entertainment
[14:01] worthless this worthless that I I I
[14:03] believe it was yesterday um the trying
[14:06] to remember off the top of my head um I
[14:09] we I read the evening devotional from
[14:10] Spurgeon and he's so beautifully put
[14:14] that so often times we think of vanity
[14:16] as you know in in back in those times
[14:18] maybe like you know uh entertainment to
[14:20] to see some some play or some some stage
[14:23] show or hear some music or something
[14:25] like that we see that oh that's just
[14:26] worthlessness that's vanity right right
[14:29] he said but anything that is not putting
[14:31] God first is Vanity and he said you can
[14:33] be uh you know sort of again to sort of
[14:35] paraphrase what he said it for more
[14:36] contemporary English that don't think of
[14:40] worthlessness as Simply Basic
[14:41] entertainment but you can be just as
[14:43] worthless at the bank as you can at the
[14:47] at the at a Broadway show am right you
[14:49] can be just as as worthless in your
[14:51] business Affairs as you can a at a
[14:54] theater if you're not putting God first
[14:56] in that okay ultimately God is your
[15:00] provider and so if you're leaning to the
[15:02] arm of the Flesh and thinking that what
[15:03] you do in your business is what
[15:04] ultimately what's is what's going to
[15:06] keep you then that's that's vanity
[15:09] that's just as worthless as wasting your
[15:10] time on anything
[15:13] okay
[15:16] um it says uh walked after vanity and it
[15:19] become vain verse six it says neither
[15:22] said they where is the Lord that brought
[15:25] us out of the land of Egypt that led us
[15:27] through the Wilderness through a land of
[15:28] deserts and pits through a land of
[15:30] drought and of the shadow of death
[15:32] through a land that no man passed
[15:34] through and where no man dwelt and so
[15:37] here was Israel completely ignorant of
[15:40] the fact that God had left them and they
[15:42] didn't care okay that the spirit of God
[15:45] had left there was no movement of the
[15:46] spirit you know they they would go to
[15:49] their church services go to their their
[15:51] their their offerings go to the go meet
[15:52] at the synagogue and God was not there
[15:55] and they didn't know it and didn't care
[15:57] it just just completely ignorant of the
[16:00] fact that God was no longer with them
[16:03] and nobody bothered to ask right and it
[16:07] says um verse 6 and I brought you out of
[16:11] a plentiful country to eat the fruit
[16:12] thereof and the goodness thereof but
[16:14] when ye entered ye defiled my land and
[16:16] made my inheritage and Abomination the
[16:18] priest said not where is the Lord and
[16:21] they that handle the law knew me not the
[16:24] pastors also transgressed against me and
[16:25] the prophets prophesied by Baal and
[16:27] walked after things do not profit so
[16:30] even the ministry ultimately what this
[16:31] is the is laid at the feet of the
[16:33] ministry first but and that's true in
[16:36] this day we it is weakness in the pull
[16:39] pit that will ultimately cause weakness
[16:40] in the church right failure of
[16:42] leadership and I I'll if Lord willing
[16:44] and I have the time I'll get into get
[16:46] into that a little bit but I don't want
[16:49] us to just throw this that particular
[16:51] verse off onto the ministry Revelations
[16:54] 1:6 clearly indicates that we are all
[16:56] high priests before God right how many
[16:59] times we say that women are the pastors
[17:00] of their of the children in their home
[17:02] right this is not just something to be
[17:05] thrown off onto the pulpit it's for
[17:07] every everyone every lay person to
[17:10] recognize this is something that I can
[17:11] do okay this is this is this is to you
[17:14] know brother bandam has the has the
[17:17] story of the of the young the man who's
[17:19] dying and the little boy tells him you
[17:20] know put your name in the in in Isaiah
[17:23] 53 right well put your name in Jeremiah
[17:25] chapter 2 once right put put put it
[17:28] there recognize where you're not holding
[17:31] up lining up to the word of God and
[17:33] conform right and and just ask yourself
[17:36] put your look yourself in the mirror
[17:39] says
[17:42] um I'm going to I'm going to have to
[17:44] just get some of this for the sake of
[17:46] time it says ultimately I want to get to
[17:48] verse uh 13 and it says for my people
[17:51] have committed two evils they have
[17:53] forsaken me the Fountain of Living Water
[17:56] and hewed them out sists broken sisters
[17:59] that can hold no water
[18:04] okay the first portion of this is that
[18:07] so I find this interesting that they
[18:08] they have two sins here right that the
[18:11] first sin is that they rejected the
[18:13] Fountain of Living Water right which is
[18:15] an interesting point to me especially to
[18:17] Israel where one of their key founding
[18:19] fundamental moments is when they're in
[18:21] the desert and the rock is smitten and
[18:24] the the Fountain of loading water comes
[18:25] forth right we know Christ is that
[18:27] Christ is that Rock and we know that in
[18:30] the Bible anytime you're talking about
[18:32] water especially Living Water this is a
[18:33] type of the Holy Spirit and so here it
[18:35] is earlier in the chapter they're
[18:37] talking about no one's asking where's
[18:38] the where's the Holy Spirit no one's
[18:40] asking where's where's God moving in our
[18:43] in our midst and it's because they had
[18:45] rejected the source of the Holy Spirit
[18:47] they rejected God they they they didn't
[18:49] want him in their in their uh in their
[18:53] lives and the second thing that they did
[18:56] is that they had hewed out
[18:59] cisterns okay so if anybody knows what a
[19:02] sistern is it's a man-made structure
[19:06] it's a tank right some of you from out
[19:09] west or around cattle might know what a
[19:11] stock tank is very similar concept it's
[19:14] just a big hole in the ground or a big
[19:16] tank that when the rain comes they run
[19:18] all the rain water off into that tank
[19:21] and it collects water and then they pull
[19:23] your water out of that now anyone's ever
[19:26] seen a a sistern nobody in their right
[19:29] mind is drinking out of that thing it is
[19:31] stagnant it sits there it accumulates
[19:33] especially around here if y'all ever
[19:35] seen a tank full of water sit around
[19:37] open to the air out in buurt you know it
[19:39] gets full of nastiness real quick right
[19:42] it's full of pollution it gets full of
[19:44] bugs and and lizards and and and frogs
[19:48] and all the birds get in it and it's
[19:49] full of nastiness and germs and scum
[19:52] grows on it and it's gross
[19:55] okay and not only that but it's a broken
[19:59] sistern it's busted it doesn't even hold
[20:02] the water that it collects for very long
[20:04] and so it's it's so here we have this
[20:07] this this type where you have people who
[20:11] rather than having the Holy Spirit
[20:13] operating through them on a regular
[20:15] basis constantly renewing them
[20:17] constantly flowing out instead they
[20:20] would rather have this this man-made
[20:23] structure this this uh satanic
[20:27] substitute that'll excuse me make them
[20:30] think well it's sort of like having a
[20:31] fountain of water it's sort of like a
[20:33] holy ghost experience it's got some holy
[20:35] ghost in it but it's polluted it's full
[20:38] of Filth it doesn't actually clean up
[20:40] anything right you know you look at a
[20:42] fountain like a a real true genuine like
[20:45] artisian well of fresh spring of water
[20:47] where that water's coming out there
[20:48] ain't nothing growing there like no and
[20:51] I mean like no bacteria no no no no um
[20:55] uh pollution there's no because it's
[20:56] constantly washing all the that stuff
[20:58] away not only that but you know you
[21:01] don't you end up with frogs and lizards
[21:04] and things living in that stagnant water
[21:06] because it's full of things that they
[21:07] eat they eat the scum they eat the filth
[21:11] right and you have people who they
[21:14] reject the pure word of God because they
[21:16] like to eat the filth right they want
[21:19] that broken sistern they want that
[21:21] sistern they can't stand to have the
[21:23] word of God constantly washing that
[21:25] stuff away cuz then it it it cramps
[21:28] their lifestyle right it you know you
[21:31] can't man I am out of time quick um you
[21:36] know they they people don't want to
[21:39] listen to the The Fountain Of God wash
[21:42] away their sins
[21:45] when you
[21:47] know I I got a couple minutes left and I
[21:50] just I just got something I want to
[21:52] couple quotes I want to
[21:56] read so
[22:02] this is from I'm just going to very
[22:04] quickly read a couple of these because I
[22:06] I just feel like I I'm I'm so burdened
[22:10] to say
[22:10] this
[22:12] says um this is from handwriting on the
[22:15] wall it says he says it used to be wrong
[22:18] for Holiness women to wear pain on their
[22:20] face and now they just gobb it on anyway
[22:22] and sing and shout and praise the Lord
[22:24] like there was nothing to it okay y'all
[22:27] can just take that with no context okay
[22:31] I think the context is pretty clear says
[22:33] what a disgrace women sing in the choir
[22:35] with bobbed hair and the Bible said
[22:37] she's an unhonorable person paint on
[22:39] their face there was only one woman who
[22:41] ever painted her face in the Bible that
[22:43] was Jezebel God fet the dogs so you see
[22:46] what he thinks about it and when you
[22:49] come tell them about it next year come
[22:51] back they're worse than they was in the
[22:53] first place irreverent they have no
[22:55] respect no thoughts of decency
[22:58] and he says and he skips down because he
[23:01] he says makes a statement then he tells
[23:02] a story about how another Minister told
[23:03] him that he should stop beating up the
[23:04] people right not stop preaching this
[23:07] stuff and he says look brother brandom
[23:10] said why then people believe you to be a
[23:11] prophet I said I never said that I said
[23:13] I was did I he said but they believe you
[23:16] to be why don't you teach them women how
[23:17] to receive the Holy Ghost and how to
[23:19] receive gifts and do something instead
[23:21] of always Bing them out about the way
[23:23] they're dressing and what they're doing
[23:24] why don't you teach them the kind of
[23:26] things to help it I said said how can I
[23:28] teach them algebra when they won't learn
[23:30] their ABCs you know what ABC is always
[23:32] believe Christ that's right so here he
[23:35] is talking about he he'll preach
[23:37] Holiness because how can God move
[23:39] through you how can the Holy Spirit move
[23:40] through you if you're not holy to begin
[23:42] with right all you're going to do is end
[23:45] up polluting the fresh word of God the
[23:46] fresh water of the Holy Spirit moving
[23:48] through you with bugs and snakes and
[23:50] everything else okay amen all right
[23:53] moving on it says Can You Feel The Holy
[23:56] scream holy Spirit screaming out from
[23:59] you oh United States and the world how
[24:01] often I would have gathered you but you
[24:03] would not now your hour has come and
[24:06] your God of Pleasure your god of Filth
[24:08] your Sodom and Gomorrah God Has Come
[24:10] among you even our little kids Beetle
[24:13] haircuts and bangs across their face and
[24:15] little perverts starting out our women
[24:17] is gone it's beyond Redemption our men
[24:19] has become big sissies walk with little
[24:21] short pants on and acting like a girl
[24:23] and hair hanging down their necks and we
[24:25] are sodomites and the fire and the wrath
[24:27] of God Waits For Us
[24:29] ouch okay by the way do yourself a favor
[24:32] once and Google what the Beatles looked
[24:34] like in the 1960s cuz he said he refers
[24:37] specifically to the Be Beatles haircut
[24:39] as a homosexual Spirit over and over and
[24:41] over again it's not something to play
[24:45] with all right there was you know and he
[24:47] mentioned he mentions short pants I'm
[24:49] going to paraphrase what he said it used
[24:50] to be wrong in a message church for men
[24:52] to wear P wear wear shorts it used to be
[24:55] that way I don't I mean it still is
[24:57] thank you brother Luther it still is I'm
[24:59] sorry I don't care what you're doing
[25:01] brother brandham said that it was it was
[25:03] to for a man to pair put on a pair of
[25:04] shorts was as if he was putting on a
[25:06] pair of women's underwear I I don't I
[25:09] mean I don't know it's just we can make
[25:12] all kinds of excuses but men please
[25:14] explain to me what is the context in
[25:15] which you would put on a pair of women's
[25:16] underwear and that's the context you can
[25:18] put on a pair of
[25:19] shorts
[25:22] okay it says and American people want to
[25:25] be entertained they stay home on
[25:27] Wednesday night to see who loves Susi or
[25:30] ever whatever that program is that shows
[25:33] what's in your heart if you love God
[25:35] you'd be at church you've got to get
[25:38] back to the church back to the Bible
[25:40] back to Christ all
[25:42] right make the excuses you want if you
[25:45] are not at the house of God I don't know
[25:48] what a good excuse for that is okay I
[25:52] understand people get an ox in the ditch
[25:53] I understand there there instances which
[25:55] people just have absolute catastrophes
[25:57] where you literally cannot make it to
[25:58] the house of God people get sick you
[26:00] have problems but if this is a recurring
[26:02] theme where you haven't been to church
[26:04] in 6 months or a month or however long
[26:09] where you can make every excuse in the
[26:11] world and or or even just not to show up
[26:13] on time how about that how about the how
[26:15] many quotes does brother bandam say that
[26:16] if you want to have the spirit of God
[26:17] move in the church show up early get
[26:19] into get in the spirit first don't wait
[26:21] for the song leader to come get you into
[26:23] the spirit get there 30 minutes early
[26:26] pray repent clean your heart out
[26:27] consecrate yourself to God before the
[26:29] song even
[26:30] starts
[26:32] okay because it shows that people don't
[26:35] actually have a desire for the word of
[26:36] God they're just showing up for an
[26:37] obligation just so they can show their
[26:38] face so they don't have somebody calling
[26:40] them to wonder where they're at you know
[26:42] they can they can just sort of appease
[26:43] their conscience maybe not actually
[26:45] interested in the spirit of God moving
[26:47] because if it did it would wash away all
[26:48] that carnality that they've got going on
[26:52] says um man I'm like out of time so I'm
[26:56] G to I'm going to
[26:58] read this last quote and and we'll
[27:00] quit um says God knows we need more
[27:04] women like that he's talking about
[27:05] zachus his wife praying for her husband
[27:07] who was not serving God yeah and he he
[27:10] pray she prayed for him constantly that
[27:12] he could uh meet Jesus and and and
[27:14] become a Christian says God knows we
[27:16] need more women like that today when
[27:18] Womanhood is broke the backbone of the
[27:20] nation is broke when women get get to a
[27:23] place that our American women are today
[27:25] is a disgrace the way our American women
[27:27] act I got a clipping out of the paper
[27:29] that I believe it was about 60% of the
[27:32] boys that went overseas in this last war
[27:35] was divorced from their wives before
[27:36] they came back their wives running off
[27:38] with somebody else in these defense
[27:40] plants working she has got no business
[27:44] in a defense plant a woman's place is at
[27:46] home with her children and when she now
[27:49] if her husband's sick and she has to
[27:51] work that's different but women's place
[27:54] is at home in the kitchen and when she
[27:56] leaves when she leaves that she's out of
[27:58] her place exactly
[28:01] right
[28:03] ouch right these things matter this is
[28:07] the instruction of Hagi our instructor
[28:09] and if we want to disregard it and say
[28:10] well that's just his opinion that's just
[28:11] an old-fashioned way of thinking that's
[28:13] just some sort of fanaticism well
[28:16] frankly when it comes to making a
[28:17] Rapture I'm a bit of a fanatic okay when
[28:19] it comes to displeasing God I'm a bit of
[28:23] a
[28:24] fanatic you know when it comes to making
[28:26] sure that my life is 100% in line with
[28:29] the word of God I am a fanatic we have
[28:32] you know that you know people have no
[28:33] problem calling themselves a sports fan
[28:35] or a fan of whatever entertainment they
[28:36] want to come up with right I'm for I'm
[28:38] I'm a fan of this team I'm a fan of that
[28:40] team I'm a fan of this musician I'm a
[28:41] fan of that movie star I'm a fan of this
[28:43] whatever well the term fan is just short
[28:45] for fanatic so we'll happily call
[28:46] ourselves a fanatic for the Dallas

[28:50] fanatic or or or a a hunting fanatic or
[28:54] whatever happily do that happily call
