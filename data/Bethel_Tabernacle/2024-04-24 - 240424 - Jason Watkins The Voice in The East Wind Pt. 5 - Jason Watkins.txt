would just have us live there amen I just look forward to the time when miles won't mean anything and we can just all live amen together close amen praise God we're going to invite you to the Book of James tonight chapter 2 I left all of my um headset microphone in my in my truck we had it using it in Virginia and so I left it in the truck and we drove sister Debbie's car tonight so I'm going to use the lollipop amen praise the Lord but I can do it amen I used to do it back in the day praise the Lord I Want by the help of the Lord to move right into part five tonight of my series on The Voice in the East Wind and so we just covet your prayers in regard to that you can well let's go ahead and get our scripture read first and then we'll let them switch over to the PowerPoint James chapter 2 very familiar reading verse 14- 26 you have it say [Music] Amen what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can Faith save him if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be you warmed and filled notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth it profit so it it's the thought that counts but it takes more than the thought to count amen so James is drawing a contrast because Paul had said you know it's Faith plus nothing and Paul just almost sounds like he eliminates works at all and that obviously you know you can read from the church history you can you can start to see that ideology going around to where it doesn't matter how I live as long as I've got faith as long as I believe in the Son of God that's all that's necessary so James is addressing that error a misunderstanding of Paul's teaching and brother Brandon points out he's not at all disagreeing with Paul at all he's actually uh amplifying it because Paul told them they should do that they should take what he built as a foundation and build on top of that and that's exactly what James here is doing so right away um he's attacking what we would call today easy believism and you say that's a modern day thing that's not that's gnosticism and it's 20 centuries old all right easy believism is at least in Christianity is 20 centuries old the early apostles were dealing with that very thing and I don't have time to give you a history lesson on that tonight just take my word for it it's not a new phenomenon so he says here in verse 18 y a man may say thou Hast faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my Works thou believest that there is one God thou doest well guess what surprise eyes the Devils also believe and tremble but wilt thou know oh vain man that faith without works is dead see it's a vain man that doesn't want to surrender his heart to the control of the Holy Spirit he wants his own way right all right watch so it's a vain man that does this verse 21 he gives him another example was not Abraham Our Father father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar because that's the argument they were making and they were actually misrepresenting Paul's teaching that they they were saying well hey you know Paul said he believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness that's it what more can a man do that was a a Baptist argument that a Baptist preacher tried to pin brother brandham with and he said brother brandham what more could a man do than believe Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness and brother Brenham said that's true that's all a man can do is believe he said but then God come around and gave him the sign of circumcision as a testimony of his faith that it was real amen see so that's what the Holy Ghost is it's a it's a seal it's a it's a it's signifies that God has accepted your faith as genuine see you brother ROM said it like this you repent of your sins how many done that he said that's you accepting him so but then he turns around and gives you the Holy Ghost that's him accepting you amen see so there's it's obvious that many will come in that day who have obviously accepted Christ and will say Lord Lord see there will be many in that day that do that but they won't make it in because they do not have the token the Holy Ghost the literal life of almighty God all right let's read on was not Abraham Our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar seest thou how Faith wrought with his works and by works was Faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God so his Works fulfilled that testimony that he believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness but there had to have a fulfillment of that in other words there had to be Wheels put to that that had to produce an action to to to make that a reality so it's not just the thought that counts all right it's your it's your action of Faith he says further verse 24 you see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by faith only likewise also here's another example likewise also was not Rahab the harlet justified by works when she had received the Messengers and had sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also that I I love how plain just sass James is he just puts it right on the on the brass tax as they say let's pray father we thank you for your word tonight I thank you having read it Lord we already have a blessing now Lord we look to you father as we go through this lesson tonight we commit ourselves into your hands Lord for your leadership in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated uh hey Gideon before you put the PowerPoint up uh turn me to Exodus 12 I want to read about three or four verses out of Exodus 12 while you're seated we'll catch this then we'll go get to the PowerPoint all right so in Exodus 12 I want just read um why don't you give me Exodus 115 first Gideon we'll read that one and then we'll start it uh and come down to chapter 12 Exodus 11 and five amen all right and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die now I want you to notice what I just said it's not all the firstborn of the land of Egypt it's all the firstborn in the land of Egypt so it's not just Egyptians it's Hebrews also Jews who refuse to follow the word and apply the token would lose their firstborn as well see and the all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sth upon his throne even unto the firstborn of the maid servant that is behind the mill and all the firstborn of Beast now go to chapter 12 verse 7 all right we'll get it in a second y'all and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side post and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it now drop down to verse 12 for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn where say it together in the land of Egypt saying it again not of the land of Egypt but in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord verse 13 and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt verse 14 and this day shall be to you for a memorial and you shall keep it uh of you shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your Generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever now we're not going to go there tonight because we went there now let's switch to my PowerPoint Gideon we're not going to go back to 1 Corinthians 5 because we were there last weekend but there is where Paul was saying that when you come to this Feast don't bring don't come to the feast with malice and sin amen but come with the sincere the unleavened bread of sincerity because that was connecting back to this fatal night for all those who would not display the token whether Jew or Gentile you understand so we're looking tonight in The Voice voice I think I can control it here let me try it the voice in the East Wind tonight is part five and I'm just going to I'm not going to keep you long we just want to make a connection tonight in some teaching uh and then we'll get get more into it on the weekend the Lord willing the voice in the East Wind and I want you to think about God's only provided way of Escape now Escape what the judgments of the East Wind remember that it was the east wind that brought the Locust remember that was the eighth plague and we had said to you in previous uh sessions previous um uh sermons in on this series that it's incredible that Pharaoh didn't hear the voice in in the East Wind because seven plagues had already struck and that was the eighth one and then the ninth one and now the 10th one and so we're looking at uh we read in our text tonight the 10th plague which was the plague of death so God's only provided way of escaping that is the bleeding word it had to be blood on display on the door over the door on the two side post amen so we're we're looking at this now to realize and this is where brother brandham would make the connection from the first Exodus to the second Exodus and then the Third Exodus is our day see there's been a resurrection already the graves of many of the Saints which slept arose and entered in with Christ that was the second Exodus now the Third Exodus is our homegoing and it always applies the same way not you notice in the second Exodus the Bible doesn't say all the graves opened right the Bible says many of the uh Graves open many of the Saints which slept arose and so we realize that brother bam goes back and he says it wasn't all the graves that open it wasn't all the Hebrews it wasn't everybody that followed Moses or Joshua or lived under under the judges or under the Kings it wasn't everybody in David's uh in David's Palace but brother brandham said it was those who died in the true faith that Abraham had and those are the ones that went up with Christ and so they had believed in the word as a Living Word and so when we come to our day it's got to be a bleeding word we say this all the time brother brandham talk called it a bleeding word the the word bled for you and what does that really even mean the bleeding word it means that it's a Living Word it has life in it it's not a a a man-made dead gospel it's a living gospel a living word because the word is a person it's the Lord Jesus Christ and he's not you know in heaven shouting down orders telling you how to live the beauty of your Redemption is that he was able to come down and live inside you and live out his life in you and through you and now you are the Living Word you are the word again made flesh in the earth when you're born again of the spirit of God so it becomes relevant to us and this is why when we are looking at this example we're taking this subtitle tonight the final plague this is the 10th plague and it's the final plague and it's death it's the it's the death angel in the land I'm here to tell you something friends I I'm sure that you're aware tonight that you are living at the final plague the Earth is under its final plague and and and death is striking the land and it's and and the only safety is when you are behind the blood when the blood is out in front of you on display so brother brandham would make a statement here from SE does not air with the shook before I go into those quotes let me just make a few more statements because I want this to be real clear tonight because I don't want to have to backtrack on this too much on Sunday so so the token today is absolutely unequivocally the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Ghost acts as a seal it acts as a guarantee it acts as a down payment of eternal life living in the realm of your soul and this is this is the beauty of the statement that brother Matt Matthew made uh in a number of sermons ago when he was teaching on this and he said you know that someday my body will receive what my soul already has I'm looking forward to that friend I'm looking forward when when I won't have the battles of the mind and I won't have the battles of the flesh when the whole the whole me will be one unified faith in almighty God so it is a living uh a life living in the realm of your soul without it and this is this needs to be stated unequivocally without it a person is not born again now you can you you may have repented of your sins and you may be justified of your past Deeds because the Bible talks about if a man will confess his sins God will forgive him and and that can be true but brother Brandon would say but you can be justified and still not yet be Sanctified you can actually be Sanctified and Justified and Sanctified and still not be born again of the Holy Spirit and the foolish virgin are that you understand and there are people who indeed have accepted Christ and have repented of their sins and the Lord did forgive their past sins but that doesn't help them in the future that remits their past sins what are you going to do about the ones today and the ones tomorrow I need a I need a position in Christ that accounts for anything I've ever done anything I ever will do I need to know that the blood that there's a blood that's speaking for me morning noon and night so people are living under a fallen nature that they were born in sin with if they have not been born again this is why Jesus made it so straight that you have to be born again and the scripture is undeniably clear that you're born again by the indwelling spirit of almighty God it's got to I mean the thought is great the thought counts but the thought without the works is dead Faith you understand so it's obvious today in the Holy Ghost era that the all important item as brother Brandon would show us and the scripture makes it really clear is not the chemistry of the blood but what that blood represents when we speak of the token under the first Exodus here in the first Exodus God was not looking for just any kind of blood but he was actually looking for a very particular kind of blood from a very specific animal with a specific nature inside the life of its blood he was looking for the nature of a lamb because that would correspond to the nature of the Lamb of God that wasn't an accident that he said you'll take a lamb and you keep it up this many days and and it's got to be perfect it can't have this blemishes and all these different things and you've got to you've got to offer that lamb and strike the post in the door with that Lamb's blood and so it wasn't just any animal you can't you can't just bring God whatever is convenient or whatever you want he's only looking for one life and that's his own and the only thing that possesses his life is his word so when you reject any part of his word you're rejecting part of his life and there's no chance to get the Holy Ghost and if you don't have the Holy Ghost there's no chance to be born again and if you're not born again you're still living under the sin nature you were born under so what God is looking for is not physical blood but he's looking for the nature of the Lamb of God when God sees his own nature now this is now we're really getting down I'm trying to put language because sometimes we brother Ram says the the tokens got to be on display the blood's got to be on display yeah what does that what does that even mean come on so we realize so I'm I'm trying to just lead you uh line by line a piece at a time so just follow with me so we know that God's not looking for just any life it's got to be a specific life which meant it had to be in a specific animal and it had to match specifically yeah God is Not Looking for physical blood he's looking for the nature of the Lamb of God so when we when God sees his own nature say what does it mean to have his blood on display what does it mean to have the token on display it means that God can see his own nature displayed through you then that's when your token is on display and that's when you are part of the first resurrection and you'll be changed just as sure as the Saints will come out of the grave and they'll come out of the Grave Just as sure as Jesus came out of the Grave the very fact that Jesus did meant the Old Testament Saints did the very fact fact that they did and the Holy Ghost fell I'm here to tell you the Saints will rise and when they rise you will be changed because you have all received the Life In The Blood amen so I'm hoping to really make this clear I'm going slow on purpose so I want to say it again what does it mean to see to say when brother brandham says the blood is on display what does that even mean it's when when God sees his own nature displayed through you then your token is on display and you are then in part of the first resurrection so the display of the blood of the Lord Jesus now none of us are smeared with his blood and none of you have it and brother brandham said the chemistry of his blood poured Down the Cross nobody has that right amen nobody has his blood and brother brandham said even if you did what would what would be more valuable his blood or you and he said you would be more valuable say you got to be kidding I'm more valuable than the blood of Jesus Christ God spent the blood of Jesus Christ as a purchasing price to get you amen amen understand he wanted you he was willing to spin the blood of Christ to purchase you amen so the display of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ is a display of his life it's a display of his nature it signifies hear me it signifies that something transformative has taken place within a person's heart and that produces a life on the outside I'm here to tell you it is folly to to to claim and believe that you are born again if you are not displaying 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year if you are not displaying The Life of Christ if it's not on display then you are not displaying the token say what about when I make mistakes what do you do about those mistakes I'll tell you what I do I repent you know why I Repent cuz I didn't want to do them that's the whole reason I Repent why don't you want to do them because I don't have that nature anymore I've lost all consciousness of sin he that that's that's the promise in the scripture that when you're born again the the worshipper has no more conscience of sin it's gone from me I don't want that kind of life anymore there's no desire in me to be fashionable to the degree that I'll dress ungodly there's no desire to chase riches that that causes my lifestyle to become carnal there's no desire in me to have friends that are going to lead me astray there's no desire in me to go all over the world and go everywhere except church I don't have those desires I've had my nature [Applause] changed God that's that's the that's the the absolute truth of it friends it's not an accident that that the ministry here has preached so much recently on the Holy Ghost amen and I can tell you it's not just here it's everywhere I go it's every preacher I'm talking to it's sermons I'm hearing online I believe that we are soon going home Hallelujah I believe soon the trumpet will sound and the dead in Christ shall rise and I want to be ready and I want you to be ready and I don't want you to believe the modern-day lie that it doesn't matter how you live or how you look or how you dress it matters you've got to have the token on display that's good this is why brother brandham emphasized that the token in Exodus 12 represents the holy gy it shows that there's been a transformation there's there's been something transformative take place and Paul Paul said it like this I no longer live amen see I died it's not me that lives it's Christ that lives see so this wasn't just you know a word salad Paul was using it wasn't just poetry Paul was trying to use language to express a living reality that operated down inside of his life I'm going to tell you something friends that when the blood is is on display that's the whole purpose for the blood to be on display in the book of Exodus because when the death angel came through then and when the Death Angel is coming through now there's a voice in that blood it's it's the voice of the Life of Christ and it's it's saying listen there's already been a death here move on Hallelujah there's the blood of Christ who died did you die no I didn't die Christ died for me and I have received his life inside of mine it's a voice that the Life of Christ has already been given on your behalf there's already been a death the idea of the token being on display means that the presence of the Holy Ghost in your life should be evident through your actions and your way of living amen amen just like the visible sign of the blood on the door was for the Israelites amen for the death angel he actually saw it this wasn't a metaphor this wasn't a Doctrine this was an action we we showed you last week that that that that that it was to be it was to make Christ manifest and we showed you how that it meant there had been an experience people had an experience the Holy Ghost is an experience it's it's a it's a death and it's a rebirth and it's you dying and Christ being up becoming alive inside you there's no shortcuts around it you can't just believe Doctrine and be okay you can't just repent of your past sins and be okay you've got to receive the literal bleeding Life of Christ and that literal bleeding Life of Christ is a bleeding word that sin in not only this day it was sin in the days of Jesus it was sent in the days of the Exodus and and and that was God's only provided way of Escape amen there is such a an assault these days H um an identity crisis and it's not just a gender identity it's a spiritual identity yes amen the the gender identity crisis going on in the world is simply uh it's simply uh you know a product a byproduct of the identity crisis of people who think they're part of Christ when they're not and and the whole world has gone after that easy believism that Christ loves everybody and everybody's going to heaven that's not true and I'm here to tell you something friends it's it doesn't respect message circles it'll come right into message churches it tries to come right into this church it tries to say it doesn't matter you can be modern you can be hip you can be like the world I'm here to tell you if you've got a desire to be modern and hip like the world we've got an altar that can fix and repair you and set you on the road to glory that we're never going to surrender this pull pit to easy believism I'm here to tell you young people I'm here to tell you married people I'm here to tell you old people I'm here to tell you if you're in the building if you're on the internet if you're hearing it an archive you must be born again you must have the token on display it must be the dominating fact of your life amen it's a visible sign it's a visible sign you say well it's it's only if my heart's right if your heart if the inside's right the outside will be right so it's a visible sign of the of the blood just like it was a visible sign on the door for the Israelites it's a call for a visible demonstration of someone's faith and commitment amen I want to say it again it's a call for our visible the holy spirit is calling all believers yeah bring forth a visible demonstration of your faith that's why we read James chapter 2 it was Rahab who was justified by her works it was Abraham who was justified say he he was justified by his faith but his Works in taking Isaac fulfilled what God had confidence that he would do brother bam sock talks about how God would never have given Abraham that unconditional Covenant but he knew Abraham would believe it so so we find that brother brandham says here watch now the seed is not air with the shook here we are presented with the picture oh the seed started now he's not he's not in Genesis with Eve he's not in Exodus with the Israelites leaving Egypt he's he's coming here now to Abraham and Sarah and Hagar and and and and we're gonna and we're going to bring forth Isaac and ishmail watch so that's where we are in the scriptures here we are presented with a picture old the seed started the seed of Promise started in a slightly doubted doubt of the original promise see how it starts low in doubt in the original promise God promised Abraham through Sarah to have this child amen but now watch the first seat of Abraham by the bonds woman come by Sarah doubting that this could happen because she was old and past the age of bearing this is how Ishmael ended up getting born ahead of Isaac because Sarah who's a type of the church slightly doubted the promise she didn't completely doubt it she only slightly doubted it and and today Israel's paying for that amen the whole world is paying for that see now that's how the church starts that's how it always starts you start now watch here's a good principle you start from the bottom you don't start from the top a man trying to climb a ladder try to get on top first to break his neck you've got to start and build up to that so you've got to have the foundation correct here's the foundation without the Holy Ghost you're not born again I don't care what you believe I don't care what kind of a list of dos and don'ts you can check box unless your Nature has been changed unless it's the literal life of almighty God living inside you and through you and you're willing to let your little light shine that's the found Foundation upon which you build everything afterwards and here we find the beginning of the promise of God being made manifest through a slightly doubted interrupted program of God that's the same way sin begin in the Garden of Eden that's how death started by sin was when one word of God was misconstrued or doubted you can't doubt or misplace one word of God that's thus sayith the Lord cuz it's every word be so so there there there's no chance for you to go in the correct way if you begin to believe anything other than the foundation where that Paul laid the very requirement that Jesus had you had to be born again by the spirit of God yeah and that has to be on display and Paul preaches it James preaches it Peter preaches it John preaches it it's it it it shows up in your life and you can believe it mentally you can even agree with it mentally that doesn't mean that it is that it actually has control of the inner nature of you and that hasn't happened if you're not willing to let to let that die if you're not willing to let that go and lots of people come to the altar and repent and they for go for years coming to an altar trying to get the Holy Ghost it's not hard to get all it takes is full surrender all it takes is a complete death and Annihilation that's the foundation see amen so he says here watch this all right he says so that's thus saith the Lord every word of God is true and here's Sarah even to the promise Sarah being a woman which a type of the church gave doubt to the original program of God's promised word and said you Abraham my husband take unto you this beautiful maid and live with her and be a husband to her and God will give his seed of promise to her and I'll take the child see just bypassing one little Iota changed the whole program amen amen listen friends when you obey God in 99% of his word and just one little Iota changes the whole program makes you from a pure believer to a not pure believer amen see one little Iota changed the whole program therefore we've got to take every word of God as thus sayith the Lord every word of God is true brother brandham says I'm watching my time brother brandham coming back to this scripture Exodus 127 and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side post and on the upper door post of the house so the token had to be on display because it's the the because the blood is going to be speaking now you brother brandham there was so many quotes where brother brandham deals with this very thought that all I could do I just went and I picked a few from his 1964 token if you go back to 63 it's all through that one it's all through 64 and it's in other sermons besides the token but I'm just going to give you these ones from 1964 many Jews want to say he was a Jew many of us wants to say he was a Jew he was neither Jew nor Gentile he was God he was a creative being by the hand of almighty God he created the Tabernacle he lived in which we know as the Son of God that's right the deity Supreme deity of Jesus Christ C God dwelt in him amen Peter said ye men of Israel Jesus of Nazareth a man made known by God by signs and wonders you've took with Wicked hands and crucified him we were Witnesses of his resurrection when the Holy Ghost had been poured out upon them excuse me now we find out that in this great thing that as God was identifying himself with Israel back there and requiring that identification now we find out here the Jews could say they might say well now wait just a minute I'm a Jew I'm in the Covenant of Abraham I'm circumcised now this is an astonishing thing you're about to come privy to brother Brandon in other quotes that I almost put up I just didn't want to read too much tonight he talks about how that when the death angel come to the door and knocked on the door cuz there's no blood on the door and the Jewish father not an Egyptian remember it's all the firstborn in Egypt not of Egypt and a Jewish father a Hebrew daddy opens the door with a Hebrew family standing behind him and says no sir you can't come in here because I'll have you know I can take you back here to a private room and prove prove to you that I'm a circumcised Jew I've got the sign of circumcision that's the Covenant God made with Abraham I have a covenant see not only that but we did slay a lamb and there's his Basin sitting on our kitchen table full of blood that wasn't the requirement the requirement was that blood had to be out here on display see this conversation was never supposed to take place see a lot of times people want to have a conversation with god well Lord if you you just let me hang on to this in my life I'll serve you Lord if you'll just let me keep this Lord don't take that from me Lord Lord let let me have this and I I kind of like this so I don't really want to let go of everything I'm here to tell you that's a conversation you never should have your conversation to say Lord Whatever It Takes by whatever means are necessary strip it from me take it from me whatever you got to do I surrender all to Jesus so he says now we find out here the Jew could say they might saywell now just a minute I'm a Jew I'm in the Covenant of Abraham I'm circumcised watch what he says here the Covenant had was an if the token wasn't displayed amen think of that I'm taking I'm talking of a token of this day if that blood wasn't displayed that token I don't care how much you could show you was a Jew how much you said you believed you might have been Rabbi priest or anything but that token had to be applied no it's no no ends or out yes or no until he saw the blood he would pass over amen see so now look let me let me finish reading I'll make my comment some fellows might say come aside here I can prove I was circumcised at 8 Days the priest has record of it my name is in the book up there that didn't have one thing to do with it if that token was not applied the Covenant was annuled it was of none effect see now I I you know there there's many more that I could have read but the point that he's making he he in one in 1963 he said you say oh I I go to the brandham Tabernacle and brother brandham snapped his fingers and he said that don't mean that to God say my mother was part of this church that don't mean that to God but I believe the message that don't mean that to God right amen if that token is not on display that don't mean that it's not that those things aren't noted by God and important to God it's good that you're in church it's good that you say you believe the message but I'm here to tell you the devil also believe leaves he's not converted see so so so we say well what what is it then that's a note and see this is this is why easy believism can't get you to heaven am because you have a covenant with Christ that that the Bible says that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever would believe in him would not perish but have everlasting life that's a covenant amen and you repented now you have a covenant just like they had Abraham Abraham believed God and he gave him a sign of circumcision but brother brandom is showing and proving by the Bible that that Covenant is of no effect it's annuled and you can say I have believed on Jesus Christ the son of God and I'm here to tell you that may be true that may be actual that may be real but it doesn't count if the token is not on dis playay that Covenant that you have between between between you and God through Christ is aown there's no way you can get access to God through Christ if you don't have the token on display you know why because the token on display is him on display and you don't have him on display because you don't have him inside you and if you don't have him inside you you're still not born again Hallelujah and you can say and think can do and believe what you want and you can let any preacher or church tell you that you can live any old way and it doesn't matter you might even stop coming to this church you might even stop doing whatever I'm here to tell you that when the Rapture comes this church is going to be empty of Believers and you will be left behind with your unbelief and your desires for the world and your your filthy Spirit I'm here to tell you God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief amen it was annulled it's of no effect no effect zero everything that you that you think you stood for and that you believed and you thought that God was somehow obligated to you because you you believed on him and you said the Lord's Prayer and you joined a church I'm here to tell you something friends you're going to find out that it's going to take a whole lot more than that am amen and it's the more that I want it's the more that I want there's a reason for it being the way it is it's not an accident that that God had purposed to redeem Israel amen he had purposed he told Abraham you're going to sojourn in a land your people for 400 years they're going to be evily mistreated but I've got a 400-year plan that I'm going to bring them out with a mighty hand you're talking about a purpose it's a 4 Century purpose that's never going to be reversed and so he's going to redeem Israel out of Egypt but he would he would do so on the only on the basis of righteousness amen you understand that you know there there's this whole there's many men it's amazing how many have written about it I was just looking over the various great minds from the manage thinkers and they all grappled with that whole concept between Justice and mercy and how do you have Justice at the sacrifice of Mercy but if you have mercy you sacrifice Justice and it it's almost like an unsolvable conundrum because God can do neither God cannot sacrifice his Justice for the sake of Mercy amen and yet Mercy rejoiceth against judgment the Bible says his throne is established in Mercy so when we look at it that way you you find that that Holiness can never ignore sin and that's that's got to be an important point that we that we put inside this this teaching tonight is that you know it's it's got to come to more than just saying I believe something even if you actually genuinely do believe it there's got to be that transition that comes from your head into your heart and produces a Life by a new desire I'm I'm not talking about sinlessness I'm talking about a perfect desire for God in his word I'm not talking about you're never making a mistake I'm talking about that that the consciousness of sin has passed from you and your whole desires for God and his righteousness and you loath your mistakes your weaknesses and your failures and you're constantly asking the Lord for his mercy and this is when Mercy rejoiceth against judgment but we find that God will not spare the Bible tells us in second Peter that when the Angels sined second Peter covers it in second Peter chapter 2 verse four that when Angels sinned he spared them not amen we find that that that according to Paul in the book of Ephesians chapter 2 that the that the even the elect even God's elected family are children of Wrath even as others and that even we at one time had our conversation in the lust of the Flesh and the things of the world God made no exception Paul tells us in 2 Corinthians 5 and this is where we were last Sunday because that because he says now when you're coming to this Feast which brother M says it's a fast it's a it's a holy time he said you don't come with malice you don't come the way the ages came this is a this is now you're coming back to the full word and when you're coming with the full word you don't come with all of that malice and sin trying to invent another denomination that's not what that's not how you come to the Lord that's that's the kind that at their tables are full of vomit and they're going to be destroyed in the tribulation yes amen but when you come you come with the unleavened bread of sincerity because Christ your Passover he was the unleavened bread he had no sin in him at all amen and so that Paul talks about in the second in second Corinthians 5 how that even God made no exception even for Jesus Christ who was made sin for us Paul tells us in Romans 8 that he didn't even spare Jesus yeah amen think about it he didn't spare the Angels amen he didn't even spare his own son you understand so when we look at it a just God in Exodus 34 tells us that he will by no means clear the guilty amen the only thing that a person can do when they're born in sin you say well Jesus wasn't but Jesus became sin and the only way that you can escape that there's nothing left for you but but to be executed because you're born in sin and he will not excuse that he will not bypass it he will not go over it sin must be dealt with sin cannot be got around sin cannot be escaped right he can't Overlook it he can't wink at it see he will by no means clear the guilty so we found that in in Exodus 11 that that if even if the Jews who were Abraham's children did not put the token on display even they lost their firstborn amen see so Justice must be satisfied amen sin must be paid its wages yes there's no escaping it so then where are we at what will we do what could Israel do what could Abraham what could anybody do friends the only way that God you say is there any solution if there's not a solution we're all doomed that's what John was crying over because if no one had a solution if no one was found worthy if no one could come forward and and even if he killed me that still won't satisfy him but there is one who could give his life and then all the sins could be placed upon this substitute and God wouldn't need you to go to Calvary he would send your lamb to Calvary and that lamb would be an eternal sacrifice and now when God looks at me he doesn't see me he sees the blood because it's on display the blood of Christ is speaking for me he doesn't see my mistakes or my weaknesses he doesn't see my failures and my ups and downs and I got them and you got them but he ain't got them Hallelujah this is why the token has to be on display this is why if it's not the Covenant is annuled amen it's his grace there was no way God found a solution in Grace amen there was no way he could give Mercy at the at the expense of his Justice right so he found a substitute and the sentence of death was executed but it fell on an innocent victim friends you ought to be the most grateful people who have ever lived to realize that tonight just how impossible it was it was impossible it doesn't matter what you believe doesn't matter what you do doesn't matter who what church you join it doesn't matter a list of rules and dos and don'ts and even if you lived a life perfectly you're still doomed because you're still born in sin but God came up with a solution hallah he came up with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost can be on display in my life now now what think you of Christ now what think you of the Holy Ghost now what think you of having the Holy Ghost on display do you do you understand the futility of trying to be even even a Christian at all without the Holy Ghost on display what an exercise in futility that will get you nowhere amen nowhere you've got to have a complete nature change the whole value of the blood of of the Lamb laid in the fact that it was a type of Christ and that's why the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 5 Christ Our Passover Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast you say uh uh I'm worthy to keep the feast no but he's worthy I'm not worthy to approach his table I'm not worthed to come with the feast I'm all I can do is bring the the unleavened bread of sincerity the unleavened bread of sincerity the unleavened bread no man-made ideology no denominational Theory it had to come back it couldn't stay in the ages that was never going to produce a Rapture it had to come back to the unleavened bread of sincerity and I'm coming tonight with a faith in the word of God and I've given my life to it and my token is on display and I can bring God back his own life and his own word and that's why I'm going in the Rapture hallelujah amen that's my ticket that's my token see it was not simply that God would provide a lamb but he would provide himself a lamb that's the beauty of it friends the lamb was provided Christ the bleeding word The Living Word Made Alive in you no wonder brother Brandon would say that the Covenant of circumcision was anull if you didn't have the Lamb's blood on display no wonder no wonder because they were all born in sin they were Abraham's children but they were still born in sin the only way to escape it to not have the death angel come into their home was to have the token on display so today faith in Christ just like Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness and and and a lot of and a lot of people they they use that as the basis for easy believism right that that Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness we'll say well isn't that true of course it's true but it's annulled if you don't have the token amen yes it's true but it's not gonna it's not you can't accept that part of the word and deny the rest of the word because then you're denying part of Christ but a prophet is showing here's what brother brandham is literally showing and pouring his heart out to those Pentecostal people that to refuse to follow the word uned the covenant made to Abraham wherein he believed and so people believe on Christ and go right to Hell people believe on Christ go right into a tribulation people who believe on Christ not everyone that saith Lord Lord amen they'll stand there on that day and they'll say Lord they'll try to call him Lord again did not we do all these things in thy name he'll say depart from me you workers of iniquity you never had my token on dis you never accepted it well how we have got it it came with the word i i i if You' have accepted the Revelation for your day the token that that would have entitled you to it it would have come into your life and it would have taken over your life you refused the word therefore you refuse me therefore you refuse my blood therefore you're standing here guilty it doesn't matter that you did all of these kinds of Works amen see so easy believism is a byproduct of the mixture that existed in the church ages that's where it came from see it's uh during that time you know even under the pure word of the alpha churches I was showing you at the beginning of the sermon gnosticism was already trying to come in with that easy believism and they're trying to Mi misquote Paul and they're trying to they're trying to misrepresent what Paul is saying and Paul talks about that in his own letters people people Paul wrote letters and say you know people accuse me that I say you can basically live any old away and Paul was saying that's not even true everybody knows I don't teach that but that's what they were teaching he believed because people wanted to live that way see and Paul had to defend himself in his own letters and and say everybody knows my manner of life and the way I've lived you know and people say you know the way if you listen to Paul you could just do whatever you want to do and that's easy believism and that's what James is trying to straighten out and people saying he's trying to say you people misunderstood Paul he's telling you himself you misunderstood him and I'm telling you this is how you misunderstood him because yes it's true that Abraham was justified by his faith but then his Works followed his faith he put wheels to his faith see so so we we find then that that's what's been restored in this time the time of the long awaited restoration the as we call it the complete restoration of the Bride tree I got to close so so let me just let me just close with these comments so listen friends I just want us to be real clear because I don't want to have to go over this again on Sunday because we're dealing with the last plague just as soon as you rejected his word if you reject any part of his word if you try to take this message and water it down and make a lightened version of it because because you think brother Brandon was old fogy or oldfashioned or you've let somebody tell you of all the errors and ups and downs he had because he was a human being thank God he made mistakes because that gives me hope and you let somebody tell you just like just like I have I have said this so many times and I I'll just say it now for the sake of the recording just in case somebody might hear it you know it's amazing that everybody that leaves the message backslides yeah they they immediately they backslide and you know the Men start cussing and social drinking and and pulling off their clothes and women start bobbing their hair and putting on men's garments and D dolling all up like Max Factor and and they and they think that they can now do that they had I was brother Donnie was telling me about that that you know they've got a podcast now and there was a a a non-binary I don't even know what that is a non-binary on this podcast weeping because now that he's come out of the message he realizes he's been set free from his prison now he can be who he really is he can be who he really is a devil it's a complete perversion as if somehow leaving the message suddenly like and I've said this before and I say it again sister dear if you think that you can Bob off your hair because now you no longer believe William brandham I got news for you a woman cutting her hair is not a William brandham Doctrine that's a St Paul Doctrine and it won't be William brandham you have to face and leaving William brandham or the message won't relieve you from what Paul said a woman putting on a garment that pertains to a man is not a William brandham teaching that's a Moses teaching that's the Bible understand it's it'll be Moses you have to face doing that not William brandham that is that is a lie that the devil is telling people and I'm here to tell you something young people you listen to brother Jason good don't you believe that don't you go that way don't you open up your ears to that garbage it's a bunch of garbage and nonsense and there those people who follow that are absolutely going to miss the Rapture and they'll stand before God at least they'll get a fair trial I'm thankful for that I was talking this the other day saying I'm glad I'm not the one that has to judge them the king will know their heart and and know what it's really about and he'll know who to Grant eternal life to and who not to but I don't want to stand there I want to be on the throne I want to be part of the first resurrection I want to get out of here when the dead in Christ rise I want to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye hallelujah amen when you when you reject any part of it friends that's that that's that's that's the same that's that's the same thing Eve did in the Garden of Eden that you might as well re been with Eve rejecting that one% you might as well been in Exodus 12 and rejecting Moses with the blood you might as well reject Christ in the gospels you might as well reject the Holy Ghost falling in the upper room you might if you're going to disbelieve any part of it you might as well throw out all the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets if you're going to disbelieve any part of it there's no need to worry about the restoration of the Bride tree cuz you're not going to be in the bride Hallelujah I'm here to tell you God has sent us a word we're here to believe it we're here to say Amen not just in my thinking not just on my lips but in my life in my heart hallelujah hallelujah he has called us at the end time to come out of her and if you don't come out to him your Covenant of justification before God is annulled you hear me clearly he has called you to come out to him and if you will not come out your J your Covenant of justification by faith in Christ is annulled because because this is Christ this is Christ it's the it's the bleeding word The Living Word of almighty God no matter that you believe him he believed 99% of the word Satan believes in God the Legion of demons uh actually in the maniac of gadera believed who Jesus was and they even acknowledged his authority over them but I'm here to tell you something friends you remember this well without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins amen without the shedding of blood Hebrews 9:22 without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins you reject the bleeding word of this hour you have no remission of your sinsen and you're not going to arrive on the day of judgment and say Pastor Jason didn't tell me that I'm telling you that now we are in the final plague we are in the Death Angel going through the land oh Hallelujah stand up with with me tonight I better just stop right
