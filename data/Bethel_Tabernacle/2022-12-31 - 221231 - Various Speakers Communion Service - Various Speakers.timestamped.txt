[13:03] on the back there I see Sister Janet
[13:05] good to have her Amen brother Danny good
[13:08] friend of mine for many many years and
[13:11] his mom and dad were great friends
[13:15] um amen it's it's hard to imagine how
[13:17] fast time flies hey brother Danny amen
[13:20] so I tell people we must be having fun
[13:24] amen well it's wonderful to serve the
[13:26] Lord isn't it
[13:27] and um so we're happy to have you
[13:30] joining us here tonight we have a little
[13:32] bit of a different kind of a schedule
[13:34] we've kind of abbreviated the
[13:36] preliminary singing and we have a
[13:39] Ministry team here for those who aren't
[13:41] familiar with it we have seven preachers
[13:44] here counting myself and so um we have
[13:47] one of them away brother Jason Demars is
[13:50] in Connecticut ministering tonight amen
[13:53] I'm glad to see the Lord strengthening
[13:54] our brother
[13:55] amen and so enemy was trying to attack
[13:58] him with some sickness but we've been
[14:00] praying for him a number of other things
[14:02] we've been praying for uh throughout the
[14:04] day especially as it relates to the
[14:07] ministry team amen so we're looking to
[14:10] for the Lord to continue to do great
[14:12] things for us what we are going to do
[14:15] now that we've had a few worship songs
[14:17] and I I just said my goodness what a way
[14:19] to end the new year amen praise the Lord
[14:22] let the devil know where we stand amen
[14:25] and so I was able to go today uh sister
[14:28] Debbie and I attended the funeral of our
[14:31] dear sister Jan now
[14:33] some of you don't really know Sister
[14:35] channel that well even if you were
[14:37] acquainted with her for some of the
[14:39] older members here we go way back with
[14:42] Brother Gary and sister Jan so sister
[14:43] Jan was a very precious treasure to us
[14:47] and the Lord saw fit to step over all of
[14:50] our prayers and bring his child home we
[14:53] just say blessed be the name of the Lord
[14:55] amen but we're going to plan a memorial
[14:59] here because the funeral service was
[15:03] just a small Affair and so we're going
[15:06] to plan a much larger event a memorial
[15:08] service we don't have the dates worked
[15:10] out exactly because the problem was that
[15:13] some of her children who are snowbound
[15:15] from that blizzard that went through
[15:17] they weren't even able to get out so
[15:19] they couldn't make the Trek down and so
[15:21] the funeral went forward so now we're
[15:23] going to arrange it with them to see
[15:26] maybe it's either going to need to be
[15:28] the second Sunday or the third Sunday
[15:31] we're tentatively aiming at the 15th of
[15:34] January we might have to move it a week
[15:36] forward to the to the weekend to the
[15:40] Sunday previous we're going to have it
[15:41] on a Sunday and where what we're going
[15:44] to do is I've invited Brother Scott
[15:46] Smith who also ministered the funeral
[15:49] today to come back down again amen and
[15:53] we're going to have um we'll we'll we'll
[15:56] kind of start in a different way and
[15:58] it'll be it'll be like a memorial Sunday
[16:00] and we'll run it a little bit different
[16:03] also it'll give me an opportunity to say
[16:07] what's on my heart Brother Scott was
[16:08] saying today he didn't really have
[16:09] enough time uh you never do in those
[16:12] funeral homes I don't like doing it in a
[16:14] church man when you come into a church
[16:15] you can just it's a it's a beautiful
[16:17] thing Amen to to to realize that you
[16:21] know the the precious in the sight of
[16:24] the Lord is the death of his children
[16:25] and you know as I've said many times I
[16:28] heard brother Dale say it many years ago
[16:30] it stuck with me said the world you know
[16:33] can't under understand
[16:34] they can't really get it but to the to
[16:38] the believer death is really preferred
[16:40] to life because that's where life really
[16:43] starts amen this is just a training
[16:46] ground here and a man that's born of a
[16:49] woman job said and we all are is just a
[16:52] few days in full of trouble and so we're
[16:55] looking to that happy reunion with our
[16:58] sister so I told Brother Scott I said
[17:00] that'll give you a chance to it'll give
[17:02] me a chance to bring some things on my
[17:05] heart of how we felt about sister Jan
[17:07] and then it'll allow Brother Scott to
[17:09] come forward I said and just take the
[17:12] first 15 or so minutes and say the
[17:14] things you didn't have time to say and
[17:16] then just go on and preach and let's
[17:18] just have a full service and we'll call
[17:21] the whole thing a big Memorial Sunday
[17:22] we'll have dinner on the ground and
[17:24] fellowship and and amen we will really
[17:27] memorialize the wonderful friendship and
[17:30] the life of our sister and you'll get
[17:32] the word of God all in one you'll get
[17:34] fellowship and singing and natural food
[17:36] and spiritual food amen we will have a
[17:38] wonderful time so we've we're trying to
[17:41] work it out the only thing that's
[17:43] determining the schedule is what her
[17:45] daughter and son can do they're up north
[17:48] way up North and so we got to try to
[17:49] work out the schedule with them I'll let
[17:51] you know more on that as we go
[17:54] so tonight we're going to have our
[17:57] ministry team come up and we're going to
[17:59] we've got six of them here and Counting
[18:00] myself so we're going to bring them on
[18:03] and let them deliver their heart a
[18:06] little bit it's impossible to preach a
[18:08] sermon in 10 minutes but that's about
[18:10] all they're going to get amen and so
[18:13] amen so amen praise the Lord Brother
[18:17] Tony I might keep him close because he
[18:19] knows how to put people on the ground if
[18:20] he has to and so and so and I've seen he
[18:25] can do it quick let me tell you amen so
[18:28] uh whether Tony don't play but we're
[18:31] happy to have them all here with us
[18:32] tonight and we're going to just invite
[18:34] you to relax and we're going to let them
[18:36] come and deliver some things on their
[18:39] heart and then I'll finish it up kind of
[18:40] anchor it and make a few comments
[18:43] something Lord put on my heart the other
[18:44] morning early amen amen in my 5 a.m
[18:47] chair brother Jack praise the lord lord
[18:49] gave me a wonderful thought I went in
[18:51] there and talked sister Debbie got her
[18:53] up and poured half a cup of coffee down
[18:55] there and then started preaching to her
[18:56] and amen next thing you know we were
[18:58] both crying
[18:59] amen so uh the Lord is good amen brother
[19:03] Joe I think you're going to kick it off
[19:05] so why don't you come on my brother God
[19:07] bless you tonight
[19:10] we'll just let everybody use this right
[19:15] amen
[19:17] are you talking about tackling preachers
[19:18] brother Luther was clapping awful hard
[19:20] back there I tell you I don't know
[19:22] kind of made me a little nervous
[19:26] but we're so happy to be here tonight
[19:28] I'm going to talk real fast because I
[19:29] don't have a whole lot of time
[19:31] unless I can get Seth to go back here
[19:33] and turn that clock back for me every
[19:34] now and then I'll just Seth I'll nod at
[19:37] you and you climb up on that ladder back
[19:39] there and turn it back for a few minutes
[19:40] all right so we're going to look in the
[19:42] Book of James you don't have to stand
[19:43] just take your bibles if you want to
[19:45] James the first chapter
[19:47] 14th verse
[19:51] and it says here every man is tempted
[19:53] when he's drawn away of his own lust and
[19:54] enticed then when lust at hath conceived
[19:57] it bringeth for sin and sin when it is
[20:00] finished bringeth forth death
[20:01] do not air my beloved Brethren every
[20:03] good gift and every perfect gift is from
[20:05] above and cometh down from the Father of
[20:07] Lights with whom is no variableness
[20:09] neither shadow of turning of his own
[20:11] will be Gat he us with the word of truth
[20:14] that we should be a kind of first roots
[20:17] of his creatures amen now what I want to
[20:20] talk about is we're you know as being
[20:23] the New Year we We tend to look back and
[20:25] and we reflect on the things that happen
[20:28] a lot of times they'll have specials
[20:30] um like who died this you know who was
[20:33] famous that died and and then we look
[20:35] forward to the future we're looking to
[20:38] make a new resolution and and um I tell
[20:41] you what I got tired of making New
[20:42] Year's resolutions I just never could
[20:44] hold to them
[20:45] but um
[20:47] but you know we we try to look so what I
[20:50] want to focus on tonight is the word
[20:52] focus is that if we can not so much look
[20:55] back in the past so much because we tend
[20:57] to like the the we like to beat up on
[21:00] ourselves a lot and the devil don't need
[21:01] no help doing that let me tell you
[21:03] because he's a he's a good one for it
[21:05] and he always reminds you of your past
[21:07] but you know as Paul said in Philippians
[21:09] 3 13 this one thing I do forgetting
[21:12] those things which are behind and
[21:14] reaching forth unto those things which
[21:17] are before now I don't want to dwell on
[21:19] the things in the past because the Bible
[21:21] doesn't even teach that it tells us to
[21:23] be looking forward to what great things
[21:25] are ahead of us amen now I want to talk
[21:28] to you about overcoming power now I
[21:30] didn't use about one minute counting
[21:32] down here overcoming power because in
[21:36] this day and time that's what the devil
[21:38] if he can take away your joy he's got
[21:40] you whipped now he'll get you whipped
[21:42] for just a little while but let me tell
[21:43] you something if we can just look and
[21:46] see what kind of tactics that he uses
[21:48] but what we have to do is what Paul said
[21:51] here the first thing we have to do is he
[21:54] says if we're drawn away of our own lust
[21:56] now lust can be any kind of a desire a
[21:58] natural desire you have or any kind of
[22:00] physical desire but you're drawn away of
[22:03] that buy it by your own lust and when
[22:06] it's conceived now we might be tempted
[22:08] by things but it don't mean you have to
[22:10] give in to them but you know like
[22:11] brother Raph said a bird can fly over
[22:13] your head but you don't have to let it
[22:14] make a nest there so when it's conceived
[22:16] when you let that thing in then it
[22:19] starts sprouting it starts growing
[22:20] starts coming out now what happens when
[22:23] it's conceived it brings forth what
[22:25] what death amen When sin is conceived it
[22:29] bringeth forth death now what we don't
[22:31] want to do is give the devil a place to
[22:33] that
[22:34] so if we if we think about the word
[22:37] Focus let's focus on this next verse it
[22:41] says 17 every good gift think about the
[22:44] goodness of God okay
[22:46] the Bible says that when you pray you
[22:49] must believe and believe that he is and
[22:52] a rewarder of them right now we say okay
[22:55] every good and when brother Brandon
[22:56] would pray in the old tapes he would say
[22:58] almighty God author of life and Giver of
[23:02] every good gift he would quote this
[23:04] scripture right here because only let me
[23:06] tell you something God gives good gifts
[23:08] the Holy Ghost is a gift he don't force
[23:11] it on you just like a pardon a pardon is
[23:14] no good you can be pardoned but if you
[23:16] don't receive that pardon it can't be
[23:19] forced on you it's a gift to do you can
[23:21] receive it or you can reject it and the
[23:24] Holy Ghost is the same way and it's a
[23:27] gift it's given to you he wants to give
[23:29] it to you more than you even want to
[23:31] receive it
[23:32] it's a precious gift amen now
[23:36] he's good every perfect gift is from
[23:38] above and cometh down from the Father of
[23:40] Lights he made all the lights the moon
[23:42] stars Universe galaxies everything that
[23:45] is out there there's no darkness in him
[23:47] no shadow of turning he has he all the
[23:50] lights was was made everything that was
[23:52] that's made was made by him cometh down
[23:55] from the Father of Lights which whom has
[23:57] no variables no shadow of turning he's
[24:00] the unchanging God he never changes hold
[24:03] to God's unchanging hand let me tell you
[24:05] something the the politics will change
[24:07] your your taste will change everything
[24:10] changes we know the weather changes if
[24:12] you don't like the weather here just
[24:13] wait about five minutes and it'll change
[24:16] so we know that God is the unchanging
[24:19] God the son is always in the same place
[24:21] but even as as as stable as that is We
[24:25] Know by science it's moving too it all
[24:28] the galaxies are moving but God doesn't
[24:29] move amen he's always there the
[24:32] unchanging God now think on those things
[24:34] so when you're having trial when you're
[24:36] having problems think about the goodness
[24:38] of God and the unchangeableness of God
[24:41] okay
[24:43] now of his own will we were begotten is
[24:46] what he says with the word of Truth now
[24:50] when Satan comes at you with Temptations
[24:52] and desires and things like that you can
[24:55] sit there and you can tell him how you
[24:56] feel you can tell him what you're
[24:58] thinking he don't care he loves that but
[25:00] let me tell you something he don't like
[25:01] is the word when you give him the word
[25:03] he takes running
[25:06] and you need to speak it out just don't
[25:08] just don't think it a lot of times oh
[25:10] you know maybe in your mind but start
[25:11] speaking those words to him there's
[25:13] something there's power in the word in
[25:15] the spoken word you say whatever you're
[25:17] tempted with cigarettes you say if if I
[25:21] defile this Temple God will destroy it
[25:24] don't be drunken with wine
[25:27] if you're tempted to look upon a woman
[25:28] remember what Jesus said you've already
[25:31] committed adultery with her in your
[25:32] heart start speaking those things out
[25:34] and rebuking the devil with it
[25:36] God will take those words that you said
[25:39] and he'll amplify it and magnify it and
[25:41] go and defeat the enemy now you might
[25:43] have to do it two or three times but
[25:45] speak it out
[25:47] amen that's how you do it with the word
[25:50] praise God now
[25:52] and we're the first fruits of his
[25:55] creatures oh my sometimes maybe you
[25:57] think well I'm a nobody I'm just a
[25:59] nothing I'm an insignificant little
[26:01] person but let me tell you something
[26:03] you're the cream of the crop in God's
[26:04] eyes
[26:06] there ain't nothing better than you are
[26:09] let me tell you something in this day
[26:11] and time that we live in you're the best
[26:13] that God has for this world
[26:15] think about that devil give that to him
[26:18] one time
[26:20] it's God living in human flesh again
[26:24] the whole purpose of Christ to come was
[26:26] to sanctify you so that the Holy Spirit
[26:29] can live in you
[26:32] and when he does you're not going to
[26:34] have malice you're not going to have
[26:36] hatred you're not going to have
[26:38] unforgiveness you're not going to have
[26:40] all these things that plague us day and
[26:42] night
[26:44] but we're going to be living for him
[26:46] looking toward his coming amen
[26:49] I can't see nothing so I got to keep
[26:51] this on of his own will he began us why
[26:54] with the word of truth that we should be
[26:56] a kind of first crew fruits of his
[26:58] creatures wherefore my beloved Brethren
[27:00] let every man be swift to hear slow to
[27:04] speak and slow to wrath that's where I
[27:06] want to be I got a few more minutes here
[27:07] now
[27:09] we are his first fruits now I want to
[27:11] think about the word focus and I wrote
[27:13] this down
[27:15] f-o-c-u-s Focus F forgive one another
[27:20] and yourself
[27:22] a lot of times we can't get past our
[27:24] past we can't get past what what the
[27:26] devil always puts up in front of us and
[27:29] maybe somebody said something to you or
[27:30] did something to you or you just can't
[27:32] get past what happened to you as a child
[27:34] I watch videos of people that are strung
[27:37] out on drugs homeless don't have hardly
[27:40] any hope in life and you can just about
[27:42] every time trace it back to something
[27:44] that happened to them when they were
[27:46] little
[27:48] something that happened to him in their
[27:49] life somehow the devil got in and and
[27:52] disrupted the plan that God had for
[27:54] their life
[27:55] oh my but forgive one another and
[27:58] forgive yourself
[28:00] now when Jesus said when you pray
[28:02] forgive it wasn't a suggestion it would
[28:04] be good if you forgive no he didn't say
[28:06] that he said when you pray forgive
[28:10] now he wouldn't give you the Commandment
[28:12] if he don't give you the power to do
[28:14] what he's said to do
[28:16] a lot of times folks say well so-and-so
[28:19] didn't do anything they haven't shown
[28:21] any remorse yet they haven't shown me
[28:24] that they're sorry that has nothing to
[28:26] do with it
[28:28] for forgiveness is not for that person
[28:30] forgiveness is for you
[28:33] Jesus said when you're down praying and
[28:35] you have ought against the brother go to
[28:37] that brother make it right
[28:38] also he said it both ways when you're
[28:41] down praying and a brother has all
[28:43] against you
[28:44] go to that brother
[28:47] now you can't always make it right
[28:48] that's up to him but that'll be on him
[28:51] you've done the right thing amen oh only
[28:54] believer's word silence everything else
[28:56] in your life that don't line up with
[28:58] God's word
[28:59] you kick it out kick it to the curb put
[29:02] it in the trash can
[29:03] on trash day amen only believe his word
[29:06] silence everything else C call on him
[29:09] daily in prayer
[29:11] oh when the trials get hard when the way
[29:14] gets rough go to your knees and say oh
[29:16] God help me today give me strength Bless
[29:19] the people in my church bless the pastor
[29:21] bless my wife bless my children
[29:24] help me oh God clean out everything in
[29:26] me that's not like you
[29:27] let me hate the things that you hate and
[29:30] love the things that you love Lord
[29:32] put that in my heart amen
[29:35] Unity of the faith amen Unity of the
[29:38] Brotherhood Fellowship come to church
[29:41] you can't have a whole lot of unity if
[29:43] you ain't in the body of Christ if
[29:44] you're not around fellowship with
[29:46] brothers and sisters of like Precious
[29:48] Faith oh my I got one more minute

[30:07] mouth

[30:11] job said I made a covenant with my eyes
[30:13] we need to make a covenant with our eyes
[30:16] amen do you love him let me read that
[30:18] again Philippians this one thing I do
[30:20] forgetting those things which are behind
[30:22] and reaching forth unto those things
[30:25] which are before I'm looking for great
[30:27] things this year you amen I'm looking to
[30:30] grow High go higher deeper depths
[30:35] in the love of Christ
[30:37] Brother Brad come on you better get on
[30:39] on your feet come on up here brother
[30:42] amen
[30:43] [Applause]
[30:45] brother
[30:48] I wish I went first
[30:51] man it's hard to back something like
[30:53] that man
[30:55] I feel like I'm just going to go over
[30:56] here and play a tape or something
[31:00] Hallelujah
[31:02] man
[31:05] like brother Donna used to say there's
[31:06] two people
[31:07] two kinds of preachers that makes me
[31:09] want to preach one who can and one who
[31:11] can't
[31:13] laughs
[31:14] so
[31:16] and this is a bad idea to have a
[31:17] microphone in our hand brother Joe
[31:21] can we take our coat off
[31:27] I'm just a
[31:29] a dumbo hillbilly
[31:32] so I went to look up the word
[31:33] exhortation
[31:36] I say he used that word a lot I got to
[31:38] know exactly what it means
[31:39] so the meaning of that word is
[31:42] it comes to the Greek word
[31:44] to call to one side to summon to
[31:48] encourage to admonish to entreat a
[31:52] language intended to incite or stir
[31:55] or encourage
[31:58] so I guess tonight we're here to stir
[31:59] you up
[32:00] we're here to encourage
[32:03] in Psalms 46 7
[32:07] . now when he told us he was going to be
[32:09] doing this and I was sitting here
[32:10] praying
[32:11] and this verse Lord of hosts is with us
[32:14] just kept going through my mind
[32:17] the Lord of hosts is with us the god of
[32:21] Jacob is our refuge
[32:23] oh Hallelujah we can sit down right
[32:26] there and say it's been good to be here
[32:31] but what a year that we've had
[32:34] what are you I mean what a time we're
[32:37] living in
[32:38] it's one of the worstest times ever
[32:40] ever
[32:42] we say that every year this has been the
[32:44] worst year ever and it is it has to be
[32:47] it's going to get worse
[32:49] but I believe as a believer of Christ
[32:51] it's the greatest time we've been living
[32:53] in
[32:56] the world is going it's gone crazy
[32:59] they've lost their mind
[33:02] through my men don't know who they are
[33:03] women don't know who they are
[33:06] you know what I'm talking about
[33:08] they go nuts
[33:11] insane
[33:13] but we sit here tonight in our right
[33:14] mind
[33:18] in her right mind you know disasters
[33:20] hitting this world
[33:22] I mean just disasters just this year
[33:25] floods everywhere killing people
[33:27] earthquakes earthquake in Afghanistan
[33:30] killed a thousand people back in June
[33:32] we got droughts
[33:35] earthquakes fires hurricanes all kinds
[33:39] of disasters that's hit this country the
[33:41] judgments of God it's not only that
[33:44] that's not counting the diseases that's
[33:46] on this place
[33:48] pitiful
[33:50] this world is going crazy the world is
[33:53] being rocked to a core
[33:55] earthquakes are shaking this place the
[33:58] Earth is groaning as we know brother
[34:00] Branham said the Earth is groaning for
[34:03] deliverance
[34:04] oh brother and sister are you groaning
[34:06] for deliverance tonight
[34:08] oh God he's shaking us through our core
[34:12] he just want to throw off unbelief he
[34:15] wants to throw off all doubt
[34:16] all these just throw it all out
[34:19] Shake us oh we want to be shook
[34:22] if you don't want to be shut come up
[34:24] here we'll lay hands on you and we'll
[34:26] start shaking you
[34:27] Shake us through our corn till we can
[34:30] say Lord Jesus Deliver Us from this
[34:32] flesh body that we live in
[34:35] [Music]
[34:37] oh but I believe the natural types of
[34:39] the spiritual
[34:40] the Earth is groaning we should be
[34:43] groaning we should be like Revelation
[34:45] says Lord come quickly Lord Jesus you
[34:48] should be fervently we should be
[34:50] groaning for this oh we're seeking that
[34:52] deliverance and he's a common it's but
[34:55] it's been the worst year
[34:57] he won't get no better
[34:59] and we've had death in our families
[35:01] sickness Cancers and their families

[35:15] the bad news is it's going to get worse
[35:18] it's going to get worse
[35:21] the good news is it's going to get
[35:23] better
[35:24] it's going to get better
[35:27] Hallelujah I'm just going to go ahead
[35:29] and say this

[35:34] listening on the internet

[42:12] Paul
[42:15] [Applause]
[42:28] it's only been 20 minutes
[42:43] foreign
[42:45] all right now I gotta follow that
[42:49] uh
[42:51] so um
[42:53] we uh let me I'm gonna start a timer so
[42:55] I don't get lost
[42:57] the um
[42:58] so I want to uh I'm gonna have to
[43:01] Channel my inner Dale Smith Auctioneer
[43:03] to get through my material
[43:06] um so I want to read uh Judges chapter
[43:08] 16 verses one through three
[43:12] um then Samson oh
[43:15] disappeared here
[43:18] then went Samson to Gaza and saw their
[43:20] Harlot and went in unto her
[43:23] and was told the Gazette saying Samson
[43:25] has come hither
[43:27] and they can pass him in and laid weight
[43:29] for him all night in the gate of the
[43:30] city and were quiet all the night
[43:33] saying in the morning when it is day we
[43:35] shall kill him and Samson lay till
[43:37] midnight and arose at midnight and took
[43:39] the doors
[43:40] of the Gate of the city and the two
[43:42] posts and went away with them barnal and
[43:45] put them them upon his shoulders and
[43:48] carry them up to the top of a hill that
[43:51] is before Hebron
[43:54] um and I want to read this uh this is
[43:56] from letting off the pressure
[43:58] it says you say well I wonder brother
[44:01] Branham I don't wonder he says you don't
[44:04] wonder you just let off the pressure
[44:06] commit your case to God and go in as if
[44:09] as if it was all over don't build up
[44:12] pressure it lets off pressure well you
[44:14] say I'm so worried brother Branham I
[44:16] just don't know let off the pressure
[44:18] Amen in the City of Refuge he took your
[44:20] worry so you don't have to have it cast
[44:23] your cares on him for he cares for you
[44:25] don't you worry about your cares that's
[44:27] his business
[44:30] all right so I want to take this um some
[44:33] of y'all might remember the last time I
[44:35] I ministered I had a uh I might have
[44:37] mentioned I was talking about you know
[44:38] like the gates of hell and whatnot and I
[44:40] I mentioned that the Gates of Hell keep
[44:42] you in not yeah they keep you in don't
[44:44] they don't keep you out and I said I was
[44:47] going to get back to that well here it
[44:48] is um
[44:49] so
[44:51] um
[44:52] so I I like the story of Samson because
[44:54] here he is he's going into the city
[44:56] doing something he knew he wasn't
[44:57] supposed to be doing
[44:59] right and he gets himself from the
[45:01] situation
[45:02] where he's completely transgressed so
[45:04] much of what the Commandments of God are
[45:07] and then has to use a gift that God put
[45:09] in his life to get him back out
[45:11] and
[45:13] I always identified with this because so
[45:15] many times I'm sure
[45:17] you know as we all have done we've
[45:19] gotten to situations where we knew
[45:20] better than to get ourselves in there
[45:21] and that then we got to get it then it's
[45:23] God delivers us and gets us back out but
[45:25] then
[45:26] to me the story
[45:28] isn't really about what Samson you know
[45:30] Samson in the city it's what he does
[45:32] after the after that right
[45:35] because it says that he carried those
[45:38] Gates on his shoulders to a hill outside
[45:40] of Hebron now if any of you have ever
[45:42] actually looked how far Hebron is from
[45:44] Gaza it's about 35 miles
[45:47] it wasn't like he just you know ripped
[45:49] him off the hinges and set him down he
[45:51] packed those Gates
[45:53] for 35 miles
[45:55] and
[45:58] you know you figure average walking
[45:59] speed that's like 12 to 14 hours of
[46:01] walking
[46:02] so he does this at midnight and he's
[46:04] done setting him down till two o'clock
[46:06] the next day
[46:08] and
[46:11] you think when in that time
[46:15] what's going through his head
[46:17] you know
[46:19] sure he got delivered
[46:21] but the agony of that situation is just
[46:26] crushing him
[46:28] for 35 miles
[46:31] and it just doesn't go away
[46:34] and so the whole time the battle the
[46:36] battle in Giza took how long five
[46:39] minutes
[46:40] the battle after the battle took 14
[46:44] hours
[46:45] and so so many times we'll get in a
[46:47] situation and God will Deliver Us
[46:50] and will be delivered a lot of times the
[46:52] situations that we got ourselves into
[46:54] and then we'll pack the guilt of that
[46:57] for 35 years
[46:58] or we'll pack you know you get healing
[47:01] in your body you know those Gates of
[47:03] Hell are trying to trap you in that
[47:04] depression trap you in that sin trap you
[47:07] in that sickness and then the Lord will
[47:09] deliver you and then for the next the
[47:12] rest of your life
[47:13] you know whatever whatever that is oh
[47:17] well I got delivered of this sickness
[47:18] but what if it comes back
[47:20] right and this thing that constant those
[47:23] Gates just sitting on your shoulders you
[47:25] know the gates of hell just crushing him
[47:26] the whole time
[47:28] and it just never went away
[47:30] and so he's he's carrying these Gates
[47:32] and I I picture them in my mind
[47:35] like so many of us you know carrying
[47:37] that that guilt of some past thing
[47:41] um
[47:43] I know I've had some experience with
[47:45] this I know there's
[47:47] I've met a lot of people who've
[47:48] struggled with this
[47:50] seems like a common thing
[47:53] um
[47:54] you know you hear especially when you I
[47:56] think when you're raising the message
[47:58] you're so exposed to a lot of what
[48:00] certain quotes and things
[48:02] scriptures
[48:05] a lot of times the devil will take
[48:07] certain scriptures and will use those
[48:09] against you right the devil's the
[48:11] devil's really good at using scriptures
[48:14] against you
[48:16] I mean you see this precedent you know
[48:18] first thing he does with Jesus is throw
[48:20] scripture at him
[48:21] you know
[48:22] and so how many times especially
[48:25] teenagers
[48:27] who grew up in the message are you know
[48:29] maybe late teens even young teens
[48:32] who are sitting there growing up and
[48:34] have had struggles with certain things
[48:37] and now there might have even got
[48:40] deliverance from certain things and yet
[48:42] will grow up into adulthood struggling
[48:45] the devil constantly telling them oh
[48:47] well you sinned and you're There's No
[48:49] Redemption for you
[48:51] send your day day of Grace away that
[48:54] time at that meeting where you could
[48:56] have got deliverance and the minister
[48:57] called you up and you felt that poll and
[48:58] you didn't go that was your last day
[49:02] I mean I know I've met I I mean I know
[49:05] this happens know this happens I've I
[49:08] know adults who have went 15 years
[49:11] struggling with this stuff
[49:13] have the Holy Ghost and the devil still
[49:15] got him wound up on this
[49:17] and when they were delivered years ago
[49:19] and they're still
[49:26] and so you know and he so here's Samson
[49:28] like so many of us
[49:31] carrying Gates of guilt or depression
[49:33] you know just just even though you're
[49:37] delivered it just doesn't go away
[49:40] said and you're still carrying this
[49:43] well
[49:46] it says that he and then then he he goes
[49:48] and Carries him up a mountain
[49:50] right it's not it's not you know so here
[49:52] he is he's got all this all these these
[49:55] burdens and he's trudging up this
[49:57] mountain right
[49:59] and it said that he he
[50:01] set them down on the hill outside of
[50:04] Hebron
[50:06] in the strongs it actually says
[50:07] translates that as the mountain that
[50:10] overlooks Hebron
[50:12] so here is climbing this mountain and I
[50:14] imagine
[50:16] that
[50:17] so I question I thought why Hebron of
[50:20] all the places
[50:22] right all these cities why did he pick
[50:25] Hebron
[50:27] Hebron is a City of Refuge
[50:31] and
[50:32] I mean I don't know that's what he was
[50:34] thinking but I was thinking it
[50:36] and I imagine in my mind here's Samson
[50:41] bearing all this guilt and shame and as
[50:44] he Crest that Hill he looks down on
[50:46] Hebron and that
[50:49] is what gives him that moment of
[50:52] realization all I have to do to get out
[50:55] from under this crushing burden is just
[50:58] let go
[51:00] it's he didn't have to go do something
[51:02] special just let it go just stop
[51:07] and
[51:10] I
[51:12] how many times do we do this
[51:14] where we're dragging our burdens and our
[51:17] all these these things some some
[51:20] you know condemnation that the devil put
[51:23] on you of something that you did so many
[51:25] years ago and you're still beating
[51:27] yourself up for it let it go there's a
[51:30] City of Refuge once you go into that
[51:32] City of Refuge there they can't follow
[51:35] you anymore your sins stop at the gate
[51:39] there's a um
[51:50] I'll um I'll wrap it up with this
[51:53] um
[51:54] is also from letting off the pressure
[51:58] it says now if if you want to do right
[52:03] I'm so glad tonight to tell you that
[52:05] there is a City of Refuge
[52:07] that Jesus Christ that's Jesus Christ if
[52:11] you don't want to do wrong
[52:13] the enemies after you then there's a way
[52:15] of escape and that escape is Jesus
[52:18] Christ there is a place where you can
[52:20] come and let off the steam
[52:24] and so whatever pressure the world has
[52:26] got you under right your own past your
[52:29] own memories your own that that fear in
[52:32] your head well oh I got healed but what
[52:34] if it comes back you know did I really
[52:36] get healed the answer is yes you really
[52:38] did get healed
[52:39] and whatever that whatever that lie is
[52:41] that's just crushing you down go to that
[52:43] City of Refuge
[52:45] and get your deliverance
[52:47] and okay
[52:57] amen praise the Lord
[53:00] amen just gonna go right into the
[53:02] scripture here
[53:03] look at the time perfect
[53:06] good to be in the house of the Lord
[53:08] First Kings 17.
[53:11] one I'm just going to take a little
[53:12] thought on seasons
[53:14] and Elijah the Tish bite first king 17 1
[53:17] and Elijah the tishbite who was of the
[53:19] inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as
[53:22] the Lord God of Israel liveth before
[53:24] whom I stand there shall not be due nor
[53:27] Reign these years but according to my
[53:29] word
[53:30] and the word of the Lord came unto him
[53:32] saying get thee hint and turn the
[53:34] Eastward and hide thyself by the Brook
[53:36] cherith that is before Jordan and it
[53:39] shall be that thou shalt drink of the
[53:40] brook that I have commanded the Ravens
[53:42] to feed thee there and he went and did
[53:44] according to the word of the Lord
[53:46] for he went and dwelt by the Brook
[53:48] cherith that is before Jordan and the
[53:50] Ravens brought him bread and flesh in
[53:52] the morning and bread and flesh in the
[53:54] evening and he drank of the brook and it
[53:56] came to pass after a while that the
[53:58] brook dried up because there had been no
[53:59] rain in the land and the word of the
[54:01] Lord came unto him saying arise get thee
[54:04] to zarephith which belongeth to zidan
[54:06] and dwell there behold I have commanded
[54:08] a widow woman there to sustain thee
[54:11] we're going to turn over to Psalm 61 and
[54:13] we're just going to read two two verses
[54:15] says Hear My Cry o God attend unto my
[54:19] prayer and from the end of the Earth
[54:21] will I cry unto thee when my heart is
[54:24] overwhelmed who's ever had that prayer
[54:26] before when my heart is overwhelmed
[54:29] but it doesn't say that there's a colon
[54:31] it says lead me to the rock that is
[54:33] higher than I
[54:35] and when I was reading this scripture
[54:36] the thought that just came upon my heart
[54:38] was you know we have these these Seasons
[54:40] that we go through in our life and every
[54:42] believer is at a different season of
[54:44] season of development that we're going
[54:46] through
[54:47] sometimes it can feel like David says
[54:49] here that your heart can just feel so
[54:51] overwhelmed by it you feel overwhelmed
[54:54] by what you're going through you feel
[54:55] overwhelmed by by the weight of the
[54:58] world you feel overwhelmed by the
[54:59] pressures and it and it's as low as you
[55:01] know you can be a young child all the
[55:02] way up you know your seasons change but
[55:05] that overwhelmed feeling can maybe stay
[55:07] there for a long time but we have
[55:10] something to look to we have a rock that
[55:13] is higher than ourselves we have
[55:15] something that we that we can take a
[55:17] place of a refuge in amen when brother
[55:19] Burley was ministering uh Christmas
[55:20] morning he said something that struck my
[55:22] heart it tied directly in with this was
[55:24] something the Lord's been dealing with
[55:25] me he talked about house you know he'll
[55:27] be reading something and maybe he
[55:29] doesn't quite understand it
[55:31] and that he could be pondering that
[55:33] thing in his mind for long periods of
[55:35] time but then maybe he hears a message
[55:37] preach or maybe he hears a tape of the
[55:39] Prophet or maybe maybe something happens
[55:41] and and then the light of Revelation
[55:43] just strikes him and when that lighter
[55:45] Revelation strikes no devil in hell can
[55:48] take that away from you because that is
[55:50] now something that the Lord has done for
[55:52] you you had a question on your heart you
[55:55] had something that you were going
[55:56] through you had a struggle a trial
[55:58] something but you were led to the rock
[56:00] that was higher than you your heart fell
[56:02] overwhelmed but you were led to that
[56:04] rock that was higher than you glory to
[56:07] God I think that's such an important
[56:09] foundation for believers to realize in
[56:12] any day in any age that you're at
[56:13] because when you give your heart to the
[56:15] Lord when the Lord when the Lord pulls
[56:17] you in you don't just automatically when
[56:19] you're you know you get the gift of the
[56:21] Holy Ghost you don't just automatically
[56:22] enter into the a fully matured state
[56:25] you have to go through seasons in your
[56:27] life you have to go through seasons of
[56:29] development seasons of change where the
[56:31] Lord is growing you it it you know you
[56:35] you have you have the Elijah here you
[56:37] have him go into this Brook he
[56:38] prophesied here right he was sustained
[56:41] he was he prophesied that there's going
[56:43] to be uh there's going to be a drought
[56:44] in the land
[56:46] and every meal was brought to him by
[56:49] this scripturally unclean bird and by
[56:52] the Brook of the water but the Lord was
[56:54] training him for something
[56:57] the Lord had him take a detour imagine
[56:59] if he had to go to he had this
[57:01] Commission on his life to go to
[57:02] zarephith and there was going to be a
[57:04] widow woman there there was going to be
[57:06] a need there there was going to be
[57:08] something that would go down in the ages
[57:10] to this day people read that story and
[57:12] have been found delivered to that of
[57:15] delivered of something because they have
[57:16] this widow woman that they can look at
[57:18] in the scriptures and they can see oh my
[57:20] goodness something happened there and it
[57:23] can happen for me too her heart was so
[57:25] overwhelmed by something but she was
[57:28] able to be found at a rock that was
[57:30] higher than herself glory to God but
[57:33] what did Elijah have to go through he
[57:34] had to go through a season of
[57:36] development he had to go through that
[57:38] Brook he had to be sustained by this
[57:40] unclean bird that didn't it didn't make
[57:42] any sense to the world sometimes the
[57:43] things we go through they don't make
[57:45] sense to the world they don't make sense
[57:47] to what your friends they don't make
[57:48] sense to things but God has something in
[57:51] plan for you he has something in order
[57:53] and it may not be for yourself it may be
[57:55] for your brother or your sister whoever
[57:57] it is for but he has a rock that he has
[58:00] and he's it's leading you to that rock
[58:02] glory to God it was time for him to go
[58:05] into this next phase now he had been hit
[58:08] he had this trust he learned how to
[58:10] trust he learned how to be he was a
[58:12] prophet the whole time he was always
[58:13] ordained but God had to lead him to this
[58:15] place where he could trust just a little
[58:18] bit more he had to lead him to this
[58:19] place of compassion where he could have
[58:22] compassion for this little widow woman
[58:23] who she had nothing to sustain her he
[58:26] had just been in that situation where he
[58:28] had nothing to sustain him but now so
[58:31] now he can see what she was going
[58:32] through sometimes we'd go through things
[58:35] just so that we can see what this person
[58:37] has gone through we go through these
[58:39] things so that we can have a rock that
[58:41] is higher than ourselves to look upon
[58:44] glory to God he uses those seasons in
[58:47] our life to grow us and to mature us
[58:49] they are to instruct us and to teach us
[58:52] oh my I'm sorry brother I'm moving
[58:54] Psalms 32 8 I will instruct thee and
[58:57] teach thee in the way which Thou shalt
[58:58] go I will guide thee with mine I
[59:01] oh man what how many how long has it
[59:03] been
[59:06] oh okay Lord forget all right
[59:11] okay I shared this with some brothers
[59:13] some months ago during some Men's
[59:14] breakfast and it's something that the
[59:16] Lord just you know I desire a greater
[59:19] walk with the Lord I think we can all
[59:20] raise our hands and say that I desire a
[59:22] greater knowledge of the word I desire a
[59:25] greater knowledge of the message I
[59:26] desire a greater Revelation I want to be
[59:28] further at than where I am right now and
[59:31] sometimes I can look at that scripture
[59:33] and I can feel overwhelmed by it all
[59:35] these sermons all these all this word
[59:37] there's so much Lord I just want to sit
[59:39] down at a table and eat it all up but I
[59:41] can't that is not how the Lord does it
[59:44] he has you go through seasons in your
[59:46] life so that you can develop yeah as you
[59:49] go through things in your life so that
[59:50] you can so you can be sustained so that
[59:53] you can learn from them we can't just
[59:55] enter into a state of full maturity we
[59:57] have to go through our Seasons we have
[59:59] to go through our times
[1:00:01] that's how the Lord designs it he
[1:00:03] designs that for a specific purpose
[1:00:06] Hallelujah and maybe it's just like
[1:00:09] whether brother Burley said maybe you
[1:00:10] have something on your heart even
[1:00:12] tonight that you've been pondering for a
[1:00:14] long time but if you keep your heart
[1:00:16] sincere and you devote yourself to
[1:00:19] seeking after a greater experience with
[1:00:21] the Lord Jesus he's going to take you
[1:00:23] into that further experience he's gonna
[1:00:25] take you and he's gonna lead you into
[1:00:27] the rock that is higher than yourself
[1:00:29] glory to God maybe it'll be a sermon by
[1:00:32] a brother preached in the light of
[1:00:33] revelation will strike or maybe it'll be
[1:00:35] as simple as you're just driving home
[1:00:37] and you're having a conversation with
[1:00:38] your wife and she just says something
[1:00:40] and it strikes you and you have that
[1:00:42] question in your heart and then it was
[1:00:44] answered and then man there's a jubilee
[1:00:46] oh praise God thank you Jesus
[1:00:51] glory to God oh sometimes we we look at
[1:00:56] ourselves and man I wish I was farther
[1:00:58] down the road than I am I have that
[1:00:59] every morning I get up I wish I was
[1:01:02] farther down the road oh but friends
[1:01:04] you're not what you used to be and just
[1:01:06] remember that oh we're not what we used
[1:01:09] to be we may not be what we need to be
[1:01:12] but we're not what we used to be and
[1:01:14] we're striving for something greater
[1:01:17] glory to God
[1:01:20] Hallelujah and until you are in Heavenly
[1:01:23] places in Christ Jesus until we are in
[1:01:26] our raptured condition we've all got
[1:01:29] some growing to do amen we're all
[1:01:31] attaining to the measure of the stature
[1:01:33] of the fullness of Christ as it says in
[1:01:35] Ephesians amen and that's what I want to
[1:01:38] strive for a more mature walking Jesus
[1:01:40] Christ walking towards Perfection oh a
[1:01:44] faith-filled prayer life seeking after
[1:01:45] the fruits of the spirit always having
[1:01:47] the attitude thy will be done
[1:01:49] nevertheless I have desires but thy will
[1:01:52] be done
[1:01:53] glory to God let's take this new year
[1:01:56] and whatever season that you're in and
[1:01:58] press towards the rock that is higher
[1:02:01] than yourself
[1:02:02] hey Lord
[1:02:09] Hallelujah let's all stand to our feet
[1:02:15] you can be seated
[1:02:20] Ephesians 6 believeth and if you could
[1:02:22] put that up have you enjoyed the
[1:02:24] preaching amen the word of God my
[1:02:27] goodness talking about Roman Candle just
[1:02:30] one after the next I just enjoyed it
[1:02:33] thoroughly and maybe I'm here tonight
[1:02:35] just uh feeling a little bit less uh
[1:02:38] more not so much in a high gear but in a
[1:02:41] low gear just something heavy upon my
[1:02:43] heart the Lord has just instructed me to
[1:02:46] speak on just for a few minutes that I
[1:02:48] got and I'm not good at keeping time so
[1:02:50] 808 I'm I'm going to start
[1:02:53] I almost uh hesitated to even uh what
[1:02:57] what I'm going to say here I'm going to
[1:02:58] share a testimony just something that
[1:03:00] the Lord did uh here recently for me and
[1:03:03] uh and so I I was a little bit what I'm
[1:03:06] going to share I'd be totally
[1:03:07] comfortable sharing here with all my
[1:03:10] friends and family in the local church
[1:03:12] here but sometimes the Lord does some
[1:03:14] things and maybe you'd be hesitant to
[1:03:16] just tell anybody so almost was tempted
[1:03:19] to kill the live stream and just mute
[1:03:21] the audio don't worry I won't do that to
[1:03:23] you you'll still be able to hear me but
[1:03:25] uh we'll just see how the Lord leads if
[1:03:27] I we keep it up or not I just don't know
[1:03:29] there's something very unique that the
[1:03:32] Lord did in my life and uh just here
[1:03:35] recently and so I'm going to share it
[1:03:36] Ephesians chapter 6 verse 1.
[1:03:39] we'll just begin reading uh actually
[1:03:41] let's let's hold the scripture just to
[1:03:43] save time instead I'm just going to I'm
[1:03:45] just going to paraphrase a few things
[1:03:47] here that I have in my notes I thought
[1:03:49] it was incredible in the scripture what
[1:03:51] that I was going to read was Ephesians 6
[1:03:53] that we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:03:55] blood but against powers and
[1:03:59] principalities and spiritual wickedness
[1:04:02] in high places I thought it was amazing
[1:04:04] brother Brad that what you've had upon
[1:04:07] your heart stirring you was the Lord of
[1:04:09] hosts which I know we've taught on that
[1:04:11] here before in that English translation
[1:04:13] for Lord of hosts is the God of Angel
[1:04:16] Armies and if I could title this here
[1:04:19] tonight I would title it angels are
[1:04:22] appearing
[1:04:24] and it's amazing I'm going to read you
[1:04:26] something here that brother Branham says
[1:04:28] in the message and I've got quite a few
[1:04:29] quotes and I hope that's all right here
[1:04:31] tonight and I probably won't get any
[1:04:33] more excited than I am right now and so
[1:04:35] uh just listen up close there won't be a
[1:04:38] crescendo just have a lot of just want
[1:04:40] to share personally just how the Lord
[1:04:42] led me uh but it's it's amazing brother
[1:04:45] Branham says this and I'm going to read
[1:04:47] it here in a moment that brother by Adam
[1:04:48] says that in the ladiesean church age
[1:04:51] the last age that Angels appear and I
[1:04:54] thought that was amazing I could
[1:04:55] highlight it here and I'll have it here
[1:04:57] for a moment uh here in a moment but I
[1:05:00] thought it was incredible
[1:05:01] that 2023 coming into 2023
[1:05:07] that the lady is seeing age will have
[1:05:10] lasted as long as the Ephesian age
[1:05:13] the Ephesian Church age went for 117
[1:05:16] years
[1:05:18] and in 2023 January 1 I hope I didn't
[1:05:22] steal your thunder if you're going to
[1:05:23] share this
[1:05:25] um this age will have gone as long as
[1:05:27] the first Age The First Alpha the last
[1:05:31] Omega
[1:05:32] and you know brother Branham when he
[1:05:34] introduces the messenger in the church
[1:05:36] age book if you read the church age book
[1:05:37] and at the beginning the messenger
[1:05:39] brother Baron begins to talk about how
[1:05:41] that no age really recognized their
[1:05:43] messenger when he was on the scene but
[1:05:45] he says but in this age it'll be a quick
[1:05:48] rapid work and brother Brandon says this
[1:05:51] he says events will transpire rapidly
[1:05:55] and so there's an acceleration that
[1:05:57] happens in this last age
[1:06:01] I want to read you just a few things
[1:06:02] brother Ethan if you could put that up
[1:06:04] here I did get this Logitech remote
[1:06:06] changed out should be this one right
[1:06:08] here so it should work for me I'm just
[1:06:10] going to read through these quickly
[1:06:11] brother Brandon says in the Harvest time
[1:06:13] I don't want to bring you conscious of
[1:06:15] that this is just something uh that I I
[1:06:18] don't maybe I don't have control might
[1:06:20] have and I'll get it off okay
[1:06:23] um brother Branham says this about the
[1:06:25] Ephesian age and he makes this comment
[1:06:28] he says that what had happened and he's
[1:06:31] speaking at the End of the Age after it
[1:06:33] went off into uh sin and and and and had
[1:06:37] brother Brandon had said the only thing
[1:06:38] left was just a little squalid village
[1:06:40] with a few few Believers left and he
[1:06:42] said they had forgotten their first love
[1:06:46] and brother Brandon takes it further
[1:06:48] than the King James and he says what did
[1:06:50] that mean it meant that they had lost
[1:06:52] the glory or The Wonder of their message
[1:06:57] they had lost the glory and the Wonder
[1:07:00] so when God comes and he came on the
[1:07:03] scene in the book of Acts there was a
[1:07:05] Wonder there was something special about
[1:07:08] it
[1:07:09] and he said they had lost that wonder
[1:07:11] and they had lost that Glory I thought
[1:07:13] about that here tonight I knew I would
[1:07:15] just be speaking and I thought if I
[1:07:17] could do anything in this testimony I
[1:07:19] just want to remind us of the glory and
[1:07:22] The Wonder of our message
[1:07:25] brother Brandon says and I'm gonna just
[1:07:27] take a few minutes to show you how close
[1:07:30] that other dimension there's an Angelic
[1:07:33] Dimension and then there's a demonic
[1:07:35] Dimension I'm going to show you how
[1:07:37] close that Dimension is to the dimension
[1:07:40] that you're living in right now because
[1:07:42] it's very close we know from the
[1:07:45] teaching of the message that that that
[1:07:47] man always lives in a multi-dimensional
[1:07:50] environment that what you see here
[1:07:52] physically what you hear here naturally
[1:07:55] is not all there is to see and that's
[1:07:58] not all there is to hear but brother
[1:08:00] Adam says man lives in a multi they talk
[1:08:02] about a Multiverse or the metaverse it's
[1:08:05] very real
[1:08:06] and that's a that's that's not an
[1:08:08] accident that the metaverse is becoming
[1:08:12] uh popular as in a buzz thing right now
[1:08:15] more than ever before virtual reality
[1:08:19] and remember in countdown brother
[1:08:21] Brandon points to the making of the
[1:08:22] automobile as man doing something
[1:08:25] naturally and God was doing something
[1:08:27] supernaturally you remember that in
[1:08:28] countdown talks about the airplane and
[1:08:30] the the then the the astronaut and the
[1:08:32] spaceship and so that that metaverse
[1:08:35] that multi-dimensional realm that
[1:08:38] science is tapping into and talking
[1:08:40] about is very real and brother Branham
[1:08:43] teaches us that if you're a Christian if
[1:08:45] you're a believer I'm going to make this
[1:08:46] very simple if you're a Christian and
[1:08:49] you've been born again that's what it
[1:08:50] means to be a Christian then when you
[1:08:53] die you go into the sixth Dimension we
[1:08:56] know there's seven and that we live here
[1:08:58] in between a heaven and a hell and the
[1:09:01] influences from both
[1:09:02] and brother Brandon says if you're a
[1:09:04] Believer you go into that sixth
[1:09:06] Dimension and he says it's a place of
[1:09:08] paradise it's a place where you're at
[1:09:10] rest it's a place where you're at peace
[1:09:12] it's where the dead in Christ go uh to
[1:09:15] be young people again and young bodies
[1:09:18] again celestial bodies waiting for the
[1:09:21] day when the Lord Jesus will return back
[1:09:23] to this dimension
[1:09:25] and and brother random says if you die
[1:09:27] and you go into a theophany then you'll
[1:09:30] take that theophany and you'll pick up
[1:09:32] this body that's laying in the dust and
[1:09:35] you'll raise it up and he says in this
[1:09:37] body and that body will make up a
[1:09:38] glorified body
[1:09:40] and he says and if you're here as Paul
[1:09:42] said we shall not all sleep but we shall
[1:09:44] all be changed if you're here alive
[1:09:46] physically at the coming of the Lord
[1:09:49] then this body that theophany comes to
[1:09:51] this body
[1:09:53] vice versa right
[1:09:55] and so brother random says that if you
[1:09:57] die you go into that where the dead in
[1:09:58] Christ go and he says he says that
[1:10:01] you're in a body that's Incorruptible
[1:10:03] it's Immortal uh and it's and it's going
[1:10:06] to be ready to reign with Christ in the
[1:10:09] new Heaven and the new Earth but he says
[1:10:11] if you're a unbeliever which is how you
[1:10:13] were born if you're a sinner who missed
[1:10:16] or fell to heed the voice of the Lord
[1:10:20] while you were in Earth if you failed to
[1:10:23] heed that call not just not just give
[1:10:25] attention to it but to surrender to That
[1:10:28] Knocking remember brother random says
[1:10:30] he's only obligated to knock one time
[1:10:33] and so he says if you fail to heed to
[1:10:36] that you never surrendered to that that
[1:10:37] means that you've rejected the gospel I
[1:10:40] never rejected the gospel brother
[1:10:42] Brandon says to reject the the Holy
[1:10:45] Ghost is to take the mark of the beast
[1:10:48] and so if you reject that meaning you
[1:10:51] never surrender to that and you breathe
[1:10:52] your last breath he says then you go to
[1:10:55] a place called The Fifth Dimension and
[1:10:57] brother Madam says it this way says oh
[1:10:59] it's that horrible Dimension like a
[1:11:02] nightmare and and and he says where this
[1:11:05] it's where the souls of the wicked and
[1:11:07] the imprisoned await that final great
[1:11:10] white Throne judgment to be judged
[1:11:12] according to the deeds in their body
[1:11:14] listen to what the prophet says I want
[1:11:16] you to be conscious of that before we
[1:11:18] approach further that God is in this
[1:11:21] room not in heaven
[1:11:24] he's in this room now in this room now
[1:11:28] is coming human beings forms of human
[1:11:30] beings passing through how I'm going to
[1:11:34] finish this in 10 minutes is going to be
[1:11:36] a miracle hope you believe in them
[1:11:38] passing through here from all around the
[1:11:40] world voices singing in this room right
[1:11:42] now but you see you're only limited in
[1:11:44] your senses to a certain percent of
[1:11:46] sight then it's got it's got to be
[1:11:49] somewhere hid from our eyes the same
[1:11:51] thing is passing through here now has
[1:11:52] passed through here when Abraham heard
[1:11:54] God say look up towards the Stars it was
[1:11:56] when Elijah said on Mount Carmel it was
[1:11:58] when Adam was here but they just now
[1:11:59] discovered it and so is God here and the
[1:12:03] angels where brother Matt in this room
[1:12:06] and someday it'll be just as much
[1:12:08] reality or tell as television or
[1:12:11] anything else because the spirit will
[1:12:13] bring us this body into that Immortal
[1:12:17] Life
[1:12:18] and he says then we'll understand
[1:12:21] [Applause]
[1:12:22] president staging my minister in a light
[1:12:24] matter time and our five senses contact
[1:12:26] them Dimensions our sight context light
[1:12:28] our filling context matter but we have
[1:12:31] contact through science the fourth
[1:12:32] dimension as it was because coming right
[1:12:34] through this building now comes pictures
[1:12:37] voices of radio pictures on television
[1:12:39] that our senses do not does not contact
[1:12:41] that yet they have a tube or a crystal
[1:12:43] that picks up those ether waves and
[1:12:45] manifests them so you see right in this
[1:12:47] building right now as live actions of
[1:12:49] people in the air live voices they're
[1:12:51] here we know it they're absolutely the
[1:12:53] truth the only thing that catch it on I
[1:12:55] don't understand the mechanics of those
[1:12:56] things science has invented but we know
[1:12:58] that proves that there's a fourth
[1:13:00] dimension Now The Fifth Dimension is
[1:13:02] where the sinner the unbeliever dies and
[1:13:04] goes to I went into third gear here The
[1:13:07] Fifth Dimension is the kind of well
[1:13:09] horrible Dimension now this man when a
[1:13:12] Christian dies he goes into the sixth
[1:13:13] Dimension and God is in the seventh
[1:13:15] Dimension now then you see when a
[1:13:17] Christian when he dies he goes under the
[1:13:18] altar of God right into the presence of
[1:13:21] God Under The Altar and here's what's
[1:13:23] wonderful and he's at rest to break it
[1:13:26] down when a man has a nightmare he's not
[1:13:28] all together asleep neither is he awake
[1:13:30] he's between asleep and awake and that's
[1:13:32] what makes him have a horrible shaking
[1:13:34] and screaming because he's not asleep
[1:13:36] he's not awake and to take that shows
[1:13:39] where a man goes when he dies
[1:13:41] unconverted
[1:13:43] he's lived his time up he's dead on
[1:13:45] Earth he can't go into the presence of
[1:13:47] God because he's not fit to go there
[1:13:48] without the blood and he's caught
[1:13:50] he can't come back to earth because he's
[1:13:52] finished his time and he's caught
[1:13:54] between he's in a nightmare he can't go
[1:13:55] into the presence of God to rest he
[1:13:57] can't come back to earth because as
[1:13:58] time's up he's in a nightmare and there
[1:14:00] he stays until the day of judgment a
[1:14:03] horrible thing to be and see now in this
[1:14:06] Vision I believe I was caught to that
[1:14:08] sixth Dimension looking back I could see
[1:14:10] back he says in sight isn't exactly with
[1:14:13] the eyes that's Earthly
[1:14:15] that's became more real to me than it's
[1:14:17] ever been before
[1:14:18] sight isn't just what we see here
[1:14:21] Earthly but sight is greater thing the
[1:14:24] sight that they have there their contact
[1:14:25] is far beyond any contact that our
[1:14:27] natural census would contact Brother
[1:14:30] random goes and I'm going to read a few
[1:14:31] of these now the same thing is wrong
[1:14:32] with you is wrong with that woman
[1:14:34] sitting over there looking younger I'm
[1:14:36] going to skip these we're going to have
[1:14:37] to I had these but that's all right
[1:14:40] brother Brandon says now friend you may
[1:14:42] think that's wrong with some of these
[1:14:43] days you'll realize if you could only
[1:14:44] take a spiritual Looking Glass and look
[1:14:47] into your soul you doubt you'd find out
[1:14:49] what it looks like and the greatest
[1:14:51] devil and the chief of all Devils is
[1:14:54] unbelief
[1:14:58] we got to go and how do you know this is
[1:15:01] leading of the spirit of God that's
[1:15:02] where I want to come to and how do you
[1:15:04] know that we all won't be gone before
[1:15:06] morning we don't know it
[1:15:08] you say that worries me it shouldn't
[1:15:12] frankly it should make you the most
[1:15:14] happy to know that you're leaving this
[1:15:16] old pest out
[1:15:18] there's another world
[1:15:21] you don't have to leave very far
[1:15:24] it's right with you
[1:15:28] it's right with you you don't have to
[1:15:30] leave very far you just God only give
[1:15:32] you five senses that's the context so
[1:15:34] much of this world but there's another
[1:15:36] world that you haven't got any senses to
[1:15:38] contact you can't contact it because you
[1:15:40] don't have it
[1:15:41] for instance I said Sunday night maybe
[1:15:43] you didn't get it we got five senses see
[1:15:45] taste smell uh C taste fill smell in
[1:15:49] here but what if you didn't have the
[1:15:50] sight you just had taste fill smelling
[1:15:52] here somebody received their sight and
[1:15:54] said there's another world son them them
[1:15:58] feelings you bump into things you were
[1:15:59] blind and what is it can tell you what
[1:16:02] it is why do you think the person was
[1:16:04] crazy because you don't have that sense
[1:16:06] of sight nobody ever had it you know of
[1:16:09] you've heard of people that said such
[1:16:11] things as that but you doubted but we
[1:16:13] know by this sense that it's real he's
[1:16:15] talking about trying to tell a blind
[1:16:17] person what it means to see
[1:16:20] and he says but we know by this sense
[1:16:22] that it's real it's a real place it's a
[1:16:24] place where you can see your senses
[1:16:26] declared that now the only thing you do
[1:16:27] when you die you just change those five
[1:16:30] senses Glory who
[1:16:32] you just receive another sense
[1:16:35] and you're alive with the higher sense
[1:16:38] thousands of times higher than this in
[1:16:41] another life a life where there's no
[1:16:43] death there's no sorrow and the things
[1:16:46] that you don't know nothing about now
[1:16:48] you see it plainly when you cross there
[1:16:51] you don't understand it now because
[1:16:53] you're bumping into it
[1:16:57] did we read that right
[1:16:59] what are we doing when we come into the
[1:17:01] house of God and the preaching of the
[1:17:02] word Goes Forth and you fill that
[1:17:03] atmosphere you're bumping into it
[1:17:07] you start worshiping the Lord and you
[1:17:09] feel the presence come down it's a real
[1:17:11] world it's a real place
[1:17:13] you can tap into it
[1:17:16] and he says you bump into it you say I I
[1:17:19] feel a strange feeling here tonight
[1:17:21] looks to me like there's I just want to
[1:17:23] cry or shout or something it's the
[1:17:27] angels of the Lord see
[1:17:30] this is the junction of time Angels
[1:17:33] appear in the end time
[1:17:35] all the prophets signpost points saying
[1:17:37] this day that angels will appear
[1:17:39] prophets will arise signs and wonders
[1:17:42] and if God did that for those little
[1:17:43] Junctions back there what will he do now
[1:17:45] when all hell turned loose all heaven
[1:17:49] will turn loose
[1:17:53] and then he says it again Angels
[1:17:55] appearing signs and wonders on Earth
[1:17:57] encounterfeits arise and God proving
[1:17:59] which is right and wrong amen
[1:18:02] can I go in overtime is that all right
[1:18:04] just for a few minutes I got the pastor
[1:18:06] approval
[1:18:08] some of his time
[1:18:11] Angels appearing I want to testify just
[1:18:14] for a moment
[1:18:15] about something that took place very
[1:18:17] unexpectedly to me and uh would maybe
[1:18:20] I'm just gonna
[1:18:22] speak just as I'm just going to say it
[1:18:24] because if I think too much about it
[1:18:26] it'll I'll I'll spend a lot more time
[1:18:28] trying to tell it
[1:18:30] but something took place when I was in
[1:18:32] just here recently we went out to
[1:18:34] minister for brother Dale and I think
[1:18:35] might be streaming here tonight
[1:18:37] and uh went out there to minister in
[1:18:39] Flagstaff and I I was there in the
[1:18:42] office just preparing for the Sunday
[1:18:43] morning service I had preached that
[1:18:45] morning and uh and they were singing in
[1:18:48] the back the worship service and I was
[1:18:50] going to preach the same thought that I
[1:18:52] preached here the last time I spoke
[1:18:54] anointed by the Supernatural and I spoke
[1:18:57] on that in three parts I think here
[1:18:59] and I Was preparing just as I normally
[1:19:01] would for any time I was going to preach
[1:19:03] just in the back nothing unnormal
[1:19:06] praying and waiting on the Lord
[1:19:08] meditating seeking the Lord and I was
[1:19:10] just back there in brother Dale's office
[1:19:12] and they were singing and there's a
[1:19:13] window right in front of the as you sit
[1:19:16] at the desk there and then there's a
[1:19:17] leather chair as you're sitting you got
[1:19:19] the computer here in a big window you
[1:19:21] can look out beautiful Flagstaff fair
[1:19:23] and then there's a leather chair here
[1:19:24] and a leather chair here and a desk and
[1:19:27] I was just there
[1:19:29] um uh preparing and and I Was preparing
[1:19:33] my notes and I and the Lord just put it
[1:19:35] upon my heart because I was going to
[1:19:37] testify about the man Marcus Humphrey
[1:19:39] brother Travis's friend who was healed
[1:19:41] of stage four Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and
[1:19:43] I was going to give that testimony and I
[1:19:45] had some of his photos in my PowerPoint
[1:19:46] slides and I was just making going
[1:19:49] throughs they were singing I wasn't
[1:19:50] really there was a screen there where
[1:19:52] that I could see if I wanted to the
[1:19:54] audience and I could hear very quietly
[1:19:55] what they were singing it was just there
[1:19:57] preparing my notes and and the Lord just
[1:19:59] Holy Spirit just spoke to me and said
[1:20:01] add because in that testimony Marcus I
[1:20:04] testified to his wife Mary about sister
[1:20:07] Elena butts from uh evening light at
[1:20:09] brother Tim Pruitt's Church how that she
[1:20:11] was also diagnosed with the same stage
[1:20:13] for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and when I
[1:20:15] told that to his wife and showed her the
[1:20:17] pet scans of her and now you have Marcus
[1:20:19] and so the you could just feel the faith
[1:20:21] in that that living room rise when we
[1:20:24] when we started to testify about that so
[1:20:25] I thought I'm going to share those
[1:20:27] pictures so I I went to get get on I
[1:20:29] knew that it was on Elena's sister
[1:20:31] Elena's Facebook I'd read it she
[1:20:33] testifies every year about the same time
[1:20:35] as an annual anniversary and so I went
[1:20:37] on there and I'm pulling down the notes
[1:20:39] and I paste them into my notes and I'm
[1:20:41] reading them and she's starting to
[1:20:43] testify about how that I went to church
[1:20:45] that Sunday morning and the doctor said
[1:20:47] giving me this diagnosis and something
[1:20:49] was very different about that day and
[1:20:51] they they were singing this song leaning
[1:20:54] on the Everlasting and as I'm reading
[1:20:58] those words that I that I had pasted
[1:21:01] leaning on the Everlasting Arms uh my my
[1:21:05] my mind went in sync with the brother
[1:21:08] who was singing the song service leaning
[1:21:11] on the Everlasting Arms word for word
[1:21:14] and at that moment that was enough to
[1:21:16] make me well you know thankful and thank
[1:21:19] Lord that's just a supernatural
[1:21:21] confirmation I'm about to go out here
[1:21:23] and preach this and as I'm reading this
[1:21:24] he's singing it
[1:21:26] and it was just right at that moment
[1:21:28] something happened it's beyond any
[1:21:31] anything that's ever happened to me
[1:21:33] before
[1:21:34] supernaturally I've spoken in tongues
[1:21:36] many times I've testified about that
[1:21:38] here and was one of the most
[1:21:39] Supernatural experiences I've ever had
[1:21:41] out of the body kind of experience
[1:21:44] um the first time meaning it's I've
[1:21:46] spoken tongues many times since then but
[1:21:48] that first initial time was just
[1:21:50] something so special about it I thought
[1:21:51] I'll never never could could how could
[1:21:54] you ever criticize that so wonderful
[1:21:57] and and but this what happened this
[1:22:01] far outweighs that
[1:22:04] and just in that moment through the left
[1:22:06] window a whirlwind just came right
[1:22:09] through the window
[1:22:11] and when it came through it
[1:22:13] and it sat right on the leather chair
[1:22:15] and I knew it was the angel of the Lord
[1:22:19] and I can't I don't have words I could
[1:22:21] describe but I don't have I don't I
[1:22:23] would be I was speechless at the time
[1:22:25] and the moment that it took place
[1:22:28] and I and I just sat there and and I'm
[1:22:32] going to say this let me just say this I
[1:22:34] never physically with my two eyes seen
[1:22:37] anything seen seen seen the angel of the
[1:22:39] Lord but I what I seen
[1:22:43] supernaturally was greater than anything
[1:22:45] I can see here looking at your faces
[1:22:47] that's why I said when brother Brandon
[1:22:49] says sight is not just limited to
[1:22:50] Earthly it's no way to describe it never
[1:22:52] had anything happen like it but that I I
[1:22:57] said it I think to my wife this way
[1:22:59] what came through that window was not a
[1:23:01] presence it was a person
[1:23:04] and when it sat on that chair that
[1:23:06] leather chair right there I couldn't
[1:23:08] speak I was I was scared I was so so
[1:23:11] scared I I told my dad immediately after
[1:23:14] I got out and I texted him a long text I
[1:23:16] said I have to tell you about what
[1:23:17] happened I have no explanation for it I
[1:23:20] said I was so frightened I was shaking I
[1:23:22] was so scared but I said but maybe
[1:23:25] scared isn't the right word but yet it
[1:23:27] is the right word I wasn't fearful it
[1:23:30] wasn't no fear inside of me but there
[1:23:33] was a fear not a someone said maybe like
[1:23:35] a reverence that's not what it was it
[1:23:37] was like a fear it was it was it was a I
[1:23:39] was scared hard to start it's like an
[1:23:41] oxymoron
[1:23:42] but it was just the Lord there and I
[1:23:46] knew at that moment what it felt to me
[1:23:49] was that the Lord said I'm coming to
[1:23:52] take charge right now
[1:23:55] and in a way that's never happened I
[1:23:57] don't have any time I've ever preached
[1:23:58] the gospel the Lord just took charge
[1:24:00] right there in that moment very very
[1:24:03] special moment
[1:24:05] there wasn't no anxiety there wasn't no
[1:24:07] fear like that but it was just a a
[1:24:10] something there that I I couldn't then
[1:24:12] when I finally could speak I'd have
[1:24:14] started crying uncontrollably I mean
[1:24:16] just pouring weeping my heart out before
[1:24:19] I could even get words out and I thought
[1:24:21] for a moment if they call me out right
[1:24:23] now I'm not going to be able to go out
[1:24:25] to preach right now I couldn't I was not
[1:24:27] in a state where I could speak and and
[1:24:29] and and I just felt the presence of the
[1:24:32] Lord there in that moment and I I don't
[1:24:34] know why the Lord did it I I've I as I
[1:24:37] said I preached on that what I've
[1:24:39] preached here I don't know why he did it
[1:24:40] was very unexpected the way that it
[1:24:42] happened but I just I texted my dad I
[1:24:45] said I don't even know hardly what to
[1:24:46] say right now I'm in the office now
[1:24:48] after preaching and and and it was I
[1:24:52] just for that moment when I knew that
[1:24:54] the Lord was there
[1:24:55] I just said Lord I'm just gonna I know
[1:24:57] you're here and I felt like I know that
[1:25:00] you're here for a mission for somebody
[1:25:02] but can I just have a moment Lord to
[1:25:04] give you some of my needs just in this
[1:25:06] moment and I begin to just to pour my
[1:25:08] heart out to the Lord
[1:25:09] and I remember standing up and when I
[1:25:13] went out to the platform I still was
[1:25:15] real broken up couldn't hardly even
[1:25:17] speak I knew the Lord was still there
[1:25:19] and I opened the door and I got a text
[1:25:23] as I as I got done preaching and it was
[1:25:26] from a brother from Georgia very
[1:25:28] well-known good friend of mine and his
[1:25:30] daughter happened to be visiting in
[1:25:32] Flagstaff and she was in that service I
[1:25:34] didn't know who she was he said brother
[1:25:37] Matt and he didn't know he wasn't at the
[1:25:39] service he said brother Maddie said I I
[1:25:40] wanted to testify to you about something
[1:25:42] that happened he says my daughter who's
[1:25:44] not a extremely emotional person he said
[1:25:47] when the door opened and you walked out
[1:25:49] he said a presence came and my daughter
[1:25:52] said Dad I just started crying
[1:25:54] uncontrollably I couldn't help it he
[1:25:56] hadn't even said the first word and she
[1:25:58] said I was just weeping and bawling at
[1:26:00] that moment sister Joanne said she was
[1:26:02] in the hospital with brother Dale and
[1:26:04] she had a supernatural experience there
[1:26:06] in the hospital room another sister
[1:26:08] after the service tech accident said I
[1:26:11] had a she was streaming from home she
[1:26:12] says and I I don't know if the sister
[1:26:14] this is something uh maybe unique to her
[1:26:17] but she texted and just sister Joanna
[1:26:19] she said at home as brother Matt started
[1:26:21] speaking I started speaking in unknown
[1:26:23] tongues and it just wouldn't stop
[1:26:26] I know the Lord was doing something
[1:26:28] special at that moment I received
[1:26:30] multiple uh testimonies after that have
[1:26:33] since then of Supernatural healings one
[1:26:35] of arthritis arthritic pain in the hand
[1:26:38] another the girl who was up there I
[1:26:40] didn't know that was her uh there in the
[1:26:43] prayer line but when she came up for
[1:26:45] prayer I knew all I can describe my only
[1:26:48] way I can say it the only reason I even
[1:26:50] testify about this it surely isn't to
[1:26:52] say anything about me at all it's just
[1:26:54] if I could do anything and that's to
[1:26:56] increase our faith to say angels are
[1:26:59] appearing
[1:27:01] angels are appearing that Dimension is
[1:27:04] pressing into this dimension
[1:27:07] and I and I knew when I was there in
[1:27:09] that prayer line I just they would speak
[1:27:11] their needs and I said you told him
[1:27:14] he heard you say it now we're going to
[1:27:16] pray
[1:27:17] I I left there as I as I said I'm going
[1:27:20] to end right here but I struggled I
[1:27:22] remember leaving walking back to the
[1:27:24] back office and I struggled to even
[1:27:26] leave the office I couldn't leave it's
[1:27:29] like I didn't want to I didn't want to
[1:27:31] leave that that office and I just stared
[1:27:33] at that chair that was there you say
[1:27:36] brother Matt what does it mean it means
[1:27:38] that God is here
[1:27:40] the devil is here
[1:27:42] demons are here angels are here
[1:27:46] and brother Branham says it in one place
[1:27:47] brother Joe shared this with me months
[1:27:49] ago how brother I quote where brother
[1:27:51] Branham Says angels are here trying to
[1:27:54] accumulate faith
[1:27:56] demons are here trying to accumulate
[1:27:59] doubt but angels are here trying to
[1:28:01] energize your faith I just raised my
[1:28:03] hand and say Lord let Angels energize me
[1:28:05] if that's their desire here tonight to
[1:28:07] press in how many would say that with a
[1:28:09] hand and say Lord may your angels come
[1:28:12] and minister to my family to my children
[1:28:14] to my home sicknesses mental health
[1:28:16] physical health emotional health I want
[1:28:19] to be a recipient of it right now give
[1:28:21] the Lord a handclap
[1:28:22] [Applause]
[1:28:31] my my
[1:28:33] you love the Lord
[1:28:36] the um
[1:28:37] services like this you
[1:28:43] you almost just say my we need a full
[1:28:46] service for everything we heard tonight
[1:28:49] and it's been a great privilege for me
[1:28:52] to hear that I was glad to hear that
[1:28:54] testimony I remember
[1:28:56] ironically
[1:28:57] um
[1:28:59] Matt texted me that on the Sunday
[1:29:02] morning
[1:29:03] and I had just testified to you
[1:29:07] that Sunday morning we had just
[1:29:09] dismissed only a little while when I got
[1:29:12] the text from him saying he had a
[1:29:15] supernatural experience and I thought
[1:29:17] that he must have heard the testimony I
[1:29:20] gave about the place I went in prayer
[1:29:23] and took all of y'all with me and we
[1:29:25] went into a pavilion amen and that same
[1:29:28] day my son was also having and and I got
[1:29:32] outside that day and other brothers were
[1:29:34] saying you know amazingly just recently
[1:29:36] a strange thing happened to me brother
[1:29:39] Joe was telling me laying on his couch
[1:29:40] and some different things happening I
[1:29:42] got some texts and phone calls from
[1:29:44] other people saying this that or the
[1:29:46] other I'm going to tell you something
[1:29:47] friends we're close
[1:29:50] we're close we're close
[1:29:53] I I was thinking about all I heard
[1:29:56] tonight I thought my
[1:29:58] I'm gonna I'm never gonna forget the
[1:30:00] word Focus
[1:30:03] that was amazing you know I I loved
[1:30:06] brother Joe's very first when he's um
[1:30:10] he's is that an acronym or an acrostic
[1:30:13] but he's work he's using the F in focus
[1:30:16] and he starts out with forgiveness and
[1:30:19] you know what a lot of people don't
[1:30:21] realize is you know this is the I mean
[1:30:24] this is the age of perfect love this is
[1:30:26] what we're to come to and that cast out
[1:30:29] fear and that that paves the way for
[1:30:32] forgiveness because we've been forgiven
[1:30:34] for so much
[1:30:35] and I I was I've said in all in pulpits
[1:30:39] around the globe reminding people that
[1:30:41] there are two unpardonable Sins not just
[1:30:44] one one is to blaspheme the Holy Ghost
[1:30:47] but the other sin that is not forgivable
[1:30:50] is the refusal to forgive
[1:30:53] because Jesus said if you won't forgive
[1:30:55] your brother his trespasses your
[1:30:58] heavenly father will not forgive you
[1:31:00] your trespasses and so to forgive is not
[1:31:04] only a privilege but a requirement
[1:31:07] my goodness I I I I thought I thought I
[1:31:11] was going to take off and and blast off
[1:31:13] uh with brother Joe and then brother
[1:31:15] Brad comes up behind it and ever it
[1:31:18] seemed like everything that was coming
[1:31:19] was conducive to the thought that's even
[1:31:22] on my heart for tonight and you know I I
[1:31:25] kept reminding myself of that quote
[1:31:28] where brother Brad was talking about us
[1:31:29] I I wish I could have found that quote
[1:31:31] and hand it to him real fast where
[1:31:33] brother Branham talks about that he says
[1:31:34] listen there will be no peace till Jesus
[1:31:37] comes
[1:31:38] you just Mark that down you say why does
[1:31:41] every age get worse because it has to a
[1:31:43] prophet was saying that in 1964 1965 he
[1:31:47] says I'll tell you something it will get
[1:31:50] thus saith the Lord it'll get worse and
[1:31:53] worse and worse it cannot get better the
[1:31:58] world is shaking and so I I just I
[1:32:01] agreed with my brother tonight I said
[1:32:03] Shake Me Lord
[1:32:05] oh I need a shaking from the Lord
[1:32:09] my and and the good news I I thought
[1:32:13] about brother Brad when you were talking
[1:32:14] about good news and bad news and I I
[1:32:17] remember years ago when uh the boy the
[1:32:19] boys used to listen to that Odyssey and
[1:32:22] um you know
[1:32:23] um the uh the end and all that and uh
[1:32:27] what's in and and you remember Eugene
[1:32:30] and Eugene he ran in one day and he said
[1:32:32] hey guys I got some good news and some
[1:32:37] news that pretty well cancels the good
[1:32:39] news
[1:32:43] oh my I thought about it you know I
[1:32:46] thought about it doesn't matter what
[1:32:47] good news they have you know they can
[1:32:49] say the stock market's up but I got news
[1:32:51] that'll kind of cancel that
[1:32:54] say oh the Democrats are saying oh we
[1:32:56] held on to the Senate that's fine but I
[1:32:57] got news that'll kind of cancel that the
[1:33:00] Republicans say we took the house well I
[1:33:02] got news that's going to kind of cancel
[1:33:03] that good news the world is perishing
[1:33:07] and it must get worse and worse I'm glad
[1:33:10] that I can give you some news tonight
[1:33:12] that there's no downside to
[1:33:16] oh my there's no bad news to the coming
[1:33:19] of the lord The Rapture his own friends
[1:33:24] my my my my
[1:33:26] I thought about
[1:33:28] um
[1:33:28] I thought about brother Matt I tell you
[1:33:30] brother Matt I have never thought about
[1:33:33] that
[1:33:35] here here I mean the way especially the
[1:33:37] way Matt says it he has that Dr Smith
[1:33:39] way
[1:33:40] and he says you know the battle only
[1:33:42] took five minutes and as soon as he said
[1:33:44] that I already knew what was coming I
[1:33:46] just about fell on the floor he said but
[1:33:48] then he carried it for 14 hours five
[1:33:51] minutes versus 14 hours
[1:33:53] friends I hope you caught that tonight
[1:33:56] I hope you realize that the City of
[1:33:58] Refuge is just in front of you
[1:34:01] whatever you've been carrying don't let
[1:34:03] the devil Humanity has a terrible
[1:34:06] propensity for to worry about things and
[1:34:09] fret over them of things that happened
[1:34:11] years ago you can't do anything about it
[1:34:13] the City of Refuge is in front of you
[1:34:16] throw it down
[1:34:18] don't let that hang on you you're you're
[1:34:21] entitled to be free it's your
[1:34:23] inheritance
[1:34:24] [Music]
[1:34:27] my throw those Gates Down Let It Go
[1:34:31] Hebron is just before you
[1:34:35] brother Caleb
[1:34:37] blew my mind with that one brother
[1:34:39] no matter your season
[1:34:42] I took such courage from that no matter
[1:34:45] your season can I say to you today don't
[1:34:48] fight your season
[1:34:50] you know why because you're fighting
[1:34:51] nature and God works in nature
[1:34:53] so don't fight Seasons that's the way
[1:34:55] God does like brother Caleb said You
[1:34:57] know here here's something I'd like to
[1:34:58] eat it all at once but God brings it out
[1:35:00] and makes you go through it God's
[1:35:02] working out something in our lives but
[1:35:04] here's the beautiful part there's always
[1:35:06] higher ground
[1:35:08] your season might be different from mine
[1:35:10] but I got Higher Ground you got Higher
[1:35:12] Ground
[1:35:13] oh I'm not fighting the seasons anymore
[1:35:15] friends
[1:35:16] I just say Lord
[1:35:18] whatever season you need me to go
[1:35:20] through I'm not going to fight it
[1:35:22] because that's fighting God
[1:35:24] because you're fighting nature nature
[1:35:26] comes in Seasons God doesn't even grow a
[1:35:29] blade of grass overnight my goodness oh
[1:35:32] I I had did the math myself
[1:35:36] some fairly recently when I started
[1:35:39] looking at the laodicean age
[1:35:42] because brother Brown talks about it was
[1:35:44] the shortest of all the ages and that's
[1:35:46] absolutely true because for the church
[1:35:48] the whole age is already closed to them
[1:35:51] that that whole denominational system is
[1:35:53] sealed away under judgment we're only
[1:35:55] stretching out history because there's
[1:35:57] not an eighth historical age see so so
[1:36:00] absolutely that that age uh for the
[1:36:03] church was very short but our historical
[1:36:06] age and I and I had recently did the
[1:36:09] math myself and I said my goodness we're
[1:36:11] right on the cusp of the Alpha and the
[1:36:15] Omega coming into perfect blending do
[1:36:18] you know something friends I was I was
[1:36:21] um watching a documentary on the History
[1:36:24] Channel and they were talking about
[1:36:26] because it reminded me because Matt was
[1:36:29] saying he read the quote and showed us
[1:36:31] where this is the time where angels are
[1:36:34] appearing and you know there's they're
[1:36:36] all a buzz now and governments never
[1:36:38] before governments always they always
[1:36:40] wouldn't talk about you know
[1:36:42] unidentified objects in the heavens
[1:36:45] aerial aerial objects whatever they've
[1:36:47] even changed the acronym now it's not
[1:36:49] UFO it's something else now UFA or
[1:36:51] something like that
[1:36:52] and and now governments are confessing
[1:36:55] it and and even the United States
[1:36:57] government and our allies are now
[1:36:59] actually talking about these things are
[1:37:02] real and they're trying to get to the
[1:37:04] bottom of it and we've got a prophet who
[1:37:05] knew what they were
[1:37:07] a half century ago you'd never convinced
[1:37:10] them but that's okay I don't need to
[1:37:12] convince them amen say you know people
[1:37:14] people people aren't so convinced about
[1:37:17] your faith my faith doesn't require them
[1:37:19] to be
[1:37:20] amen praise the Lord friends for me it's
[1:37:23] it's not a matter of who's right and
[1:37:26] who's wrong I know whom I have believed
[1:37:30] amen and I I and and I you know they
[1:37:33] they are I was and on this on this
[1:37:36] history documentary they were talking
[1:37:38] about this the new super collider I
[1:37:40] forget where it's at seemed like it's
[1:37:41] somewhere in the Scandinavian countries
[1:37:42] somewhere in Europe they've got that
[1:37:44] super collider and you know what they're
[1:37:45] doing you know what they're using that
[1:37:47] for right now they're studying
[1:37:49] dimensions
[1:37:51] they're aware there's more than just
[1:37:54] light time and matter and there's more
[1:37:57] than our five senses contact and their
[1:37:59] science is now trying to unlock it we're
[1:38:02] close
[1:38:04] we're close friends we're very very
[1:38:06] close amen
[1:38:09] I uh I'm not going to go into my thought
[1:38:11] tonight I've got permission from the
[1:38:13] Lord to put it off till in the morning
[1:38:14] that's my advantage I get I get I get
[1:38:17] all the time I want tomorrow but how
[1:38:20] many have enjoyed
[1:38:22] my the presence of the Lord give these
[1:38:25] brothers a hand amen
[1:38:33] praise the Lord
[1:38:35] um
[1:38:36] so
[1:38:38] um Matt I'm thinking that that what we
[1:38:41] might do because I told the musicians
[1:38:44] they like to come down with when their
[1:38:45] families come up for the table
[1:38:47] and uh so instead of bringing them back
[1:38:49] up at all once the communion starts
[1:38:51] maybe we could just play the pre-service
[1:38:53] music can that work yeah okay we'll do
[1:38:55] that amen you know friends it's a grand
[1:38:58] privilege to come to the Lord's Supper
[1:39:01] and I I I don't ever I don't ever want
[1:39:05] the Lord's Supper to be you know
[1:39:07] something that we just take haphazardly
[1:39:11] it's really not ever to be that you know
[1:39:14] the Lord's Supper is something of a
[1:39:17] special occasion for us you know and I
[1:39:20] you know it's uh it's what's amazing is
[1:39:23] is that it's a TR it's not just a
[1:39:27] tradition but it's an ordinance of the
[1:39:29] church that Jesus said in motion and
[1:39:32] said you should keep doing this and
[1:39:34] brother Branham said those those were
[1:39:36] three ordinances and that that he left
[1:39:38] us was water baptism and communion and
[1:39:41] foot washing
[1:39:43] and you know so the Lord's Supper then
[1:39:46] has a function in the same way
[1:39:49] for believers today I want you to get
[1:39:51] your mind around that it has the same
[1:39:54] function for believers today that it had
[1:39:58] for believers two thousand years ago
[1:40:00] because you know the only thing that
[1:40:02] separates you from Simon Peter and James
[1:40:07] and Paul and all of those who used to
[1:40:09] take the Lord's Supper when they were in
[1:40:11] the upper room with Jesus and even going
[1:40:13] into the New Testament era and they took
[1:40:15] the Lord's Supper do you know the only
[1:40:17] thing that separates you from them
[1:40:19] time
[1:40:21] other than that you are in that same
[1:40:24] family you are we are all enjoined by
[1:40:28] the blood of Jesus Christ back to God
[1:40:31] through faith isn't that a beautiful
[1:40:34] thing that's not just a metaphor friends
[1:40:36] that the the records of Heaven record
[1:40:39] you as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:40:42] my and so it's done in remembrance we
[1:40:46] know that that it's done in remembrance
[1:40:48] of the Lord and and it is it is a it is
[1:40:53] a it is a kind of a kind of continual
[1:40:58] Proclamation
[1:41:00] it is a way of testifying it's a way of
[1:41:03] coming to the Lord's table together it's
[1:41:06] amazing and I've I've noticed it over
[1:41:08] the years how many
[1:41:11] um times in various churches this church
[1:41:14] included in other churches I've been at
[1:41:16] and and been a part of other churches
[1:41:19] and and and even even churches I visited
[1:41:23] how that not everybody will come to the
[1:41:26] Lord's table
[1:41:27] and it's it's a sadness there for that
[1:41:31] because this is this is one of the other
[1:41:34] than your water baptism taking the name
[1:41:37] of the Lord Jesus Christ could you
[1:41:39] imagine
[1:41:41] could you imagine saying I'm a Christian
[1:41:43] could you imagine claiming you were a
[1:41:46] Christian
[1:41:47] and you refuse to be baptized
[1:41:50] and you just said I don't need to do
[1:41:51] that and you never went to the water you
[1:41:54] never gathered as a public witness with
[1:41:56] God's family and was willing to go to
[1:42:00] the water and take the name of the Lord
[1:42:02] Jesus Christ in baptism communion and
[1:42:05] foot washing are the three ordinances
[1:42:08] together water baptism communion and
[1:42:11] foot washing and there will be people
[1:42:13] who are willing to get baptized and
[1:42:15] claim to be a believer but who will
[1:42:17] never come to the Lord's table
[1:42:20] it is important it is vitally important
[1:42:24] and you know if it wasn't important the
[1:42:26] Lord wouldn't have set the order you
[1:42:28] ever think about that the Lord the Lord
[1:42:31] didn't do things you know without reason
[1:42:32] he didn't operate redundantly he didn't
[1:42:34] do things without cause and without
[1:42:36] purpose he didn't entertain
[1:42:39] he didn't do any of those things he he
[1:42:42] brought them together for a purpose and
[1:42:46] when we come together and we're going to
[1:42:48] read about it in First Corinthians 11
[1:42:50] here in a moment but but you know this
[1:42:53] as we come to this ordinance I believe
[1:42:56] that it has a strengthening quality to
[1:43:00] it I believe it strengthens our faith
[1:43:02] because we're coming together in
[1:43:05] observation of the Lord's broken body
[1:43:07] and the blood he said that's not a small
[1:43:10] thing
[1:43:11] that's not a small thing it reinforces
[1:43:15] not only does it strengthen our faith
[1:43:17] but it reinforces the good news of the
[1:43:21] Gospel not only that but it brings us
[1:43:23] together listen friends if it doesn't
[1:43:26] accomplish one other thing it brings us
[1:43:28] together in love
[1:43:30] it brings us together in harmony to come
[1:43:33] and take the Lord's supper and meet at
[1:43:35] the table together
[1:43:37] as a family of God
[1:43:39] and then we go and we wash one another's
[1:43:42] feet why because that's an expression of
[1:43:45] Brotherly Love
[1:43:47] well you know when brother Branham went
[1:43:49] beyond and that voice said to him this
[1:43:53] is what you always preached was the Holy
[1:43:56] Ghost Divine love amen we're going to
[1:44:00] change the order of the service now
[1:44:04] and I'm going to ask brother Luther to
[1:44:07] come forward and make make ready
[1:44:10] um I tell you what brother Andrew why
[1:44:12] don't you come back to the piano and
[1:44:14] just you and we'll we'll let you play
[1:44:17] and then once the uh once um
[1:44:20] everything gets going then we'll switch
[1:44:22] over to the music let's turn in our
[1:44:25] Bibles to First Corinthians 11 please if
[1:44:28] you will
[1:44:41] just play for us softly brother Andrew
[1:44:52] First Corinthians
[1:44:55] 11 and we'll begin reading at verse 23.
[1:45:01] Paul said
[1:45:03] for I have received of the Lord
[1:45:06] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:45:09] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:45:13] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:45:16] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:45:19] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:45:23] is broken for you
[1:45:25] this do in remembrance of me
[1:45:30] so it's remembering the Lord
[1:45:32] it's a time to come together to
[1:45:34] consecrate ourselves consecrate our
[1:45:37] hearts and remember the sacrifice the
[1:45:40] lord gave
[1:45:42] verse 25.
[1:45:44] after the same manner also he took the
[1:45:47] cup when he had stopped saying
[1:45:50] this cup is the New Testament in my
[1:45:53] blood
[1:45:54] this do ye as often as you drink it in
[1:45:58] remembrance of me
[1:46:01] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:46:04] drink this cup you do show the Lord's
[1:46:07] death till he come
[1:46:10] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:46:12] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:46:14] unworthily
[1:46:15] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:46:18] the Lord I love these next verses
[1:46:22] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:46:26] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:46:29] cup
[1:46:30] what up
[1:46:32] what a release from a an ominous verse
[1:46:37] prior
[1:46:38] because look friends
[1:46:40] the bottom line is that none of us feel
[1:46:43] Worthy
[1:46:45] I don't care how long you've been a
[1:46:47] Christian
[1:46:48] the sometimes the longer you've been a
[1:46:50] Christian
[1:46:51] this might sound amazing but sometimes
[1:46:54] the longer you've been a Christian the
[1:46:56] more evidence the devil's got against
[1:46:57] you because you've had that many more
[1:46:59] times to stumble when you were a sinner
[1:47:01] you just you weren't you didn't commit
[1:47:04] sins when you were a sinner you just
[1:47:06] were in sin only a Christian brother
[1:47:08] Brown said only a Christian commits sins
[1:47:10] but sinner just is sin he's just living
[1:47:13] in sin it's not measured that way but
[1:47:16] once we give our heart to the Lord then
[1:47:18] you know I just want to say tonight
[1:47:23] this next verse when I read where it
[1:47:26] says to me examine yourself
[1:47:29] and then eat
[1:47:31] I just want to say to you tonight
[1:47:33] examine yourself before the Lord and
[1:47:35] throw those Gates down
[1:47:37] throw them down examine yourself before
[1:47:40] the Lord say what's my examination say
[1:47:42] Lord here I am tonight and maybe I've
[1:47:44] had this failure and that failure and
[1:47:46] every kind of failure but Lord tonight
[1:47:48] I've come under the examination of your
[1:47:50] word I'm going to admit I've been wrong
[1:47:51] and I'm going to ask you to forgive me
[1:47:53] and I'm going to ask you to help me and
[1:47:55] I'm going to throw those Gates down I'm
[1:47:58] going to walk into the City of Refuge
[1:48:00] and I'm going to take the Lord's supper
[1:48:01] and so let him eat I love that
[1:48:06] my
[1:48:07] for he that is for this call he says he
[1:48:11] says verse 27 wherefore whosoever shall
[1:48:14] eat of this bread and drink of this cup
[1:48:16] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:48:18] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[1:48:20] let a man examine himself and so let him
[1:48:24] eat of that bread and drink of that cup
[1:48:28] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:48:30] unworthily
[1:48:33] Edith and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:48:35] not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:48:38] for this calls many are weak and sickly
[1:48:41] among you and many sleep
[1:48:42] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:48:45] should not be judged but when we are
[1:48:49] judged we are chastened of the Lord that
[1:48:52] we should not be here's the good news
[1:48:54] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:48:58] world
[1:48:59] not beautiful aren't you glad for that
[1:49:02] today
[1:49:04] let's stand to our feet amen
[1:49:07] I want to sing a chord of this there is
[1:49:09] a fountain is that what you're playing
[1:49:11] there is a fountain

[2:05:41] thank you
[2:07:13] ah
[2:07:45] a
[2:08:04] hmm
[2:08:08] in the gospel of
[2:08:11] John Chapter 13 John's gospel chapter
[2:08:14] 13.
[2:08:16] verse 1.
[2:08:25] now before the Feast of the Passover
[2:08:29] when Jesus knew that his hour was come
[2:08:32] that he should depart out of this world
[2:08:34] unto the father
[2:08:37] having loved his own which were in the
[2:08:39] world he loved them unto the end that's
[2:08:42] such a beautiful way of saying it
[2:08:45] and supper being ended
[2:08:48] the devil having now put into the heart
[2:08:50] of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray
[2:08:54] him
[2:08:55] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[2:08:58] all things into his hands
[2:09:00] and that he was come from God and went
[2:09:03] to God
[2:09:04] he riseth from supper laid aside his
[2:09:07] garments and took a towel and girded
[2:09:09] himself
[2:09:11] after that he poured water into a basin
[2:09:13] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[2:09:16] to wipe them with the towel wherewith he
[2:09:18] was girded
[2:09:20] then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter
[2:09:24] saith unto him Lord Dost thou wash my
[2:09:27] feet
[2:09:28] Jesus answered and said unto him
[2:09:31] what I do
[2:09:33] thou knowest not now
[2:09:35] but Thou shalt know hereafter
[2:09:38] Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never
[2:09:40] wash my feet
[2:09:42] Jesus answered him if I wash thee not
[2:09:44] thou has no part with me
[2:09:47] Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my
[2:09:50] feet only but also my hands and my head
[2:09:54] Jesus saith to him he that is washed
[2:09:56] needeth not saved to wash his feet but
[2:09:59] is clean every wit and you're clean but
[2:10:02] not all
[2:10:03] for he knew who should betray him
[2:10:05] therefore
[2:10:07] said he ye are not all clean
[2:10:10] so after he had washed their feet and
[2:10:13] had taken his garments and was set down
[2:10:15] again he said unto them know ye what I
[2:10:17] have done unto you done to you
[2:10:19] you call me master and Lord and you say
[2:10:23] well for so I am
[2:10:25] if I then your Lord and Master have
[2:10:28] washed your feet you also ought to wash
[2:10:31] one another's feet for I have given you
[2:10:34] an example that ye should do as I have
[2:10:38] done to you
[2:10:39] verily verily I say unto you the servant
[2:10:42] is not greater than his Lord neither he
[2:10:46] that is sent greater than he that sent
[2:10:49] him if you know these things happy are
[2:10:52] you if you do them
[2:10:54] at this time our brothers will be

[2:53:40] Hallelujah
[2:53:42] in the Lord wonderful
[2:53:44] let's stand to our feet we're going to
[2:53:46] get ready to dismiss and let you go and
[2:53:49] amen invite you back tomorrow
[2:53:52] amen praise the Lord and
[2:53:54] wouldn't it be wonderful
[2:53:57] if tomorrow the trumpet sounds
[2:54:01] oh you know friends I was reflecting
[2:54:03] about 2023 thinking to myself
[2:54:08] no one
[2:54:10] no one
[2:54:11] thought such a thing
[2:54:14] I can tell you raised up in this my
[2:54:16] whole life since a child
[2:54:19] been ministering around the world for a
[2:54:21] long time
[2:54:23] and I can tell you I've set in ministers
[2:54:25] meetings everywhere in churches
[2:54:26] everywhere and heard sermons so many
[2:54:27] sermons in my lifetime
[2:54:30] no one
[2:54:32] thought anyone would ever say it's 2023.
[2:54:37] no one no one
[2:54:40] and I thought about that and I realized
[2:54:43] the Lord said you know
[2:54:45] kind of had to be that way because I
[2:54:47] said I'd come in the hour you'd think
[2:54:49] not
[2:54:50] and the one I had to wait till no one
[2:54:53] thought it would ever be that and that's
[2:54:56] when I could come
[2:54:58] so praise the Lord whatever 2023 holds
[2:55:02] if it holds the Rapture remember the
[2:55:04] other day I was preaching and I spun my
[2:55:07] calendar around I started just spinning
[2:55:09] through days and I said how do we know
[2:55:11] but where there it went we might just
[2:55:13] pass by you know when the bride leaves
[2:55:15] here the world will go right on
[2:55:18] time will just go right on brother
[2:55:20] Brandon said they'll they'll keep going
[2:55:21] to church they'll sing songs they'll
[2:55:24] preach they'll even come to the altar in
[2:55:26] Repentance and thinking they're getting
[2:55:28] saved and it's already the rapture's
[2:55:30] already come and gone he said one of
[2:55:32] these days they'll say well wasn't this
[2:55:33] supposed to happen wasn't that supposed
[2:55:35] to happen Prophet said they'll hear a
[2:55:37] voice speak out of the air and say it's
[2:55:38] already happened and you didn't know it
[2:55:41] I'm glad to be on the on the no in the
[2:55:44] know I'm glad to be in the know amen I
