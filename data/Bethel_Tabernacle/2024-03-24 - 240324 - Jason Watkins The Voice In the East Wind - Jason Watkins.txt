on the road home Trip South so just want to be praying for them and all the others um who are traveling I don't have any uh certain prayer requests this morning so we're going to invite you into the scripture to Jeremiah chapter 51 amen praise the Lord Jeremiah 51 the Lord has put a uh this sermon thought on my heart back at the uh beginning of the week and I've just pondered it all week and add it here and there and um move the title around a few different times the title I sent to the booth this morning is the voice in the East Wind The Voice in the East Wind Jeremiah 51 we're just going to grab two verses verse 15 and 16 he being God he hath made the Earth by his power he hath established the World by his wisdom and hath stretched out the Heaven by his is understanding I just want you to absorb who's in charge want to read verse 15 again he hath made the Earth by his power doesn't seem that anyone was helping him he hath established the World by his wisdom so he didn't need any advice or counseling and hath stretched out the Heaven by his understanding now having established that look at the 16th verse when he utth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the Earth he maketh Lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures let's pray father we thank you this morning to read these words they are a comfort to me Lord because I realize who is in control of all things I realize who is in control of my life I realize who is in control of this service I realize Lord that you are in control of all things and that you move by Your Word you speak your word and the winds and the Sea obey you speak your word Lord and the water and the vapor and everything moves father we read Lord in other places where Isaiah came into the temple and he fell into a vision and he saw the Lord high and lifted up and his train filling the temple and at his voice the pillars of the temple were moved oh god father I pray you'll move us today by Your Word help us now Lord as we go forward I commit myself into your hands bless our visitors in the camp today bless our families who are traveling those traveling away those traveling home Lord we're we're we're very much in love with you and your word today and we desire to hear from you now I commit myself into your hands as I have from the early morning hours Lord bring forth your word now Lord and may it move us father deep in our hearts today that's why we're here this is not a social Gathering Lord we're here to hear from almighty God from his word Lord there's nothing you know Lord you know my way is always Lord in my life and always in my Ministry I've always asked you Lord show it to me in your word and I'll believe it forever oh God I I I've not chased great Supernatural signs and wonders I've not chased the excitable things Lord you have done plenty of that in my life and Ministry but it's always been your Sovereign hand but Lord if if even an angel appeared I could doubt the angel if a sign happened I could doubt the sign but your word is sure to me oh God and I love your word and when you show it to me in your word I'm fearless with it Lord I will stand and face all the enemy all at once as long as I know that I'm standing on your word Lord help us today help us as a people Lord commit ourselves into your hands aresh this trying age this perilous Time Lord the shaking of the world the heavens and you said once more I shake heavens and earth Lord and we are in that time oh God we are in that Harvest Time that Rapture time that latter rain age oh God we have arrived we're here it's now this is now this is happening in real time oh God and I pray that you will sharpen our understanding Quicken our hearts to believe you purge us Lord give us fresh cleansing this morning let nothing hinder the going forth of your word and nothing hinder the receiving of your word granted Lord we commit ourselves into your hands to this end in Jesus name amen God bless you friends as you are seated the voice in the East Wind I want you to uh and brother Mark I by the way not to uh go with the PowerPoint today and uh so we're but we're going to refer to quite a number of scriptures because that's where our faith is is in the word of God so I want you to realize that as we read from our text he hath made the Earth by his power and he hath established the World by his wisdom and he hath stretched out the Heaven by his understanding now this informs my thinking and I trust that it does yours as well that really there is nothing that can come my way that's not under his jurisdiction amen there's nothing you say well well what about judgments he's the one who brings the East Wind of judgment and you're going to find find out here in the Bible that the East Wind is almost always associated with the Judgment hand of God or ominous things that the Lord is doing and so so this so hence my title I almost titled it feeling the East Wind but I decided that it was more poignant to say the voice because I'm referring to the voice of God in the East Wind and I I can't help but look around me in the world today and though I read in the Bible of the very condition that the Earth would be in and it is and the judgments that God promised would accompany it and they do and yet it seems like no one is hearing his voice it seems like the world is just determined to go headlong into the very way and into the very thing and into the very direction that God warned against through millennia through His prophets through his Apostles through his servants through the voice of many Waters I hope today that you have a heart that is ready to hear the word of God and Lord what are your directions for my life what are your instructions to me in every situation I will assure you today that God values his word and fact is the Bible talks about how that he values his word above his name and so and you know sometimes people are a little confused by that statement it's the scripture he values his word he he holds his word in higher esteem than his own name and that doesn't that's not necessarily to say that he holds his name in a lower estimation than his word what it simply means is is that over time God has has um changed or not so much changed but has allowed his name to evolve so he was Elohim but then he comes and and and and even Abraham talks about how that he was Jehovah Gyra and we know that there are seven compound Redemptive names of Jehovah he is Jehovah RFA he the the Lord that Health all thy diseases he is Jehovah Gyra the Lord provid all your needs he is Jehovah savior Jehovah Banner Jehovah buckler he's all of these things to meet every challenge that you could ever face in life from the Cradle to the Grave the Lord has control over everything so his his the understanding of his name has evolved he comes to Moses in the in the book of Exodus and and he says to Moses now you you're going to understand my name Jehovah more clearly Because by the name by my name Jehovah I really wasn't known formerly although Abraham knew and identified him as Jehovah Gyra God is simply meaning that the very essence and the Very meaning behind the name Jehovah whereas Elohim is just the self-existing spirit the all powerful all knowing all seeing God but Jehovah now takes on a further understanding that God is now dwelling with his people so you understand the his name evolves his name ends up in Jesus and God put his name in Christ amen Christ put his name in the church see so the name of God evolves but the one thing that never changes is his word his word is always the same he's a Healer now cuz he was a Healer then he's a savior now he say he became a savior at Calvary he was a savior in Genesis when he slew a lamb and gave Adam and Eve [Music] skins so he he does not change in his word ever so he so th thus he would say he values his word above his name uh it's not that one is more valuable than the other it's just the way that he attribut Utes in the way he goes about revealing it so the B the bottom line comes down to this is that whether it's his name he's uttering or whether it's his word that he's uttering you have to understand that when he utters his voice things move things happen God said let there be light and there was there was no way for it to not be because and no one could block that because God believed his own word God has said at the end time and that the world would go completely insane and it has and he said I'll perfect a bride right under Satan's nose and he is and I'll take a chased virgin home in a Rapture and he shall he said there will be people who disbelieve my word there are he said there will be people who believe my word and there are and I'm them are you them amen if you're believing his word then you're on the right path so we find that when he utters his voice there's effect on the waters there's effect on even the vapors he where we read in our text and and don't don't republish it Mark we're going to hit Psalms 29 and a moment but we find that his voice moves the waters not just Waters but a multitude of waters and even he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the Earth and and and to to ascend from the ends of the Earth so nature obeys him to and from coming and going he maketh lightning say lightning is scary he maketh it he maketh lightning and rain and rain can be to your good or to your harm if it's too much he brings forth the wind and the wind we know the wind can be destructive we we live with hurricanes along the Eastern Seaboard We There are areas of the Midwest who live with sudden tornadoes they're you know they have this thing in nature and this thing in nature and and and this kind of bomb development that they call it but but he refers to the wind as coming out of his treasures so you wouldn't normally associate something out of God's treasure with something bad but but you have to understand that when God is bringing forth his wind and very typically in the Bible more often than not nine out of 10 times at least on average the East Wind pends judgment Calamity penalty he has a North Wind a south wind and a West Wind and they have totally different meanings in fact is completely different meanings we're going to look at that briefly Psalms 29 1-1 give unto the Lord oh ye Mighty give unto the Lord glory and strength give unto the Lord thy Glory due unto his name Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness that's quite there's no ambiguity there I mean this is just straight language you know give unto the Lord the glory do his name now that's not just coming into a building and raising our hands which anybody can do that but when it Satan can imp inate people raising their hands and crying real tears and actually move people by emotions but when but what he cannot impersonate is that life that life that comes into your Fallen life and turns you into a new creation in Christ Jesus and so the the order is that we give unto him the worship that we worship him we give him the glory that his name deserves you you I'm here to tell you that your life lived in glory to him is is your re is your requirement it's a it's do you right and you you should never want to live your life in a way that does the opposite of that you ought to let your life glorify him all the time not only in our actions proactively but in our reactions which are more often than not what gets us into trouble amen but but our but and that's why the Bible says that when you can't when you when it deals with your reactions and it talks about a man who can't control his Spirit that's a very bad thing because Solomon attributed that to an unwalled undefended City that the enemy can just come in and plunder because you have no defenses you're you're out of control and I'm here to tell you that the word of God puts you under control it controls your mind it controls your where you go it controls what you do what you say what you think how you react how you respond the testimony that your life the voice of your testimony that people hear not talking about what comes out of your lips talking about what comes out of your life your your life is a voice so he says in verse three of Psalms 29 the voice of the Lord is upon the waters so so we found out again that he's controlling the waters we found out he controls Vapors and lightning and rain and wind now also verse three the glory of the god of Glory thundethunder1 the voice of the lord breth The Cedars yay the Lord Break The Cedars of Lebanon he maketh them also to skip like a calf I mean he can do either one Lebanon and serion like a young unicorn verse seven the voice of the Lord catch it now here's some more of his control the voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire I like see you try that the voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire the voice of the Lord shaketh the Wilderness the Lord shaketh the Wilderness of cadesh so it's not just your local life it's your distant life it's your everything it's your coming and going it's whatever is part of your life the Lord has power to control it to shake it or to get he can send an East Wind or he can send an North Wind or a West Wind or a south wind verse n the voice of the Lord maketh the Hinds to calf and discover the forest and in his Temple doth everyone speak of his glory the lord look at this 10th verse the Lord sth upon the flood yay the Lord sth king forever so I want you to notice he's not standing he's he he sth so he's undisturbed in his authority he's un challenged in his authority sitting is not a defensive position but he's not in a defensive position because he's not threatened by anything I'm so glad that he sth undisturbed ruling over my life he's unthreatened by anything thank you indeed verse 11 the Lord Lord will give strength unto his people can you say Amen the Lord will bless his people with peace can you say Amen we find thank you brother Mark we find uh and and I I I may have you put some others up but wait till I ask you so that we don't it I don't get slowed down we find in the book of Exodus when Israel was being released from their 430 years of bondage now the Lord had said they would be in bondage it didn't take God off catch him off guard at all the people were bewildered by their life but God had told Abraham your people shall sojourn in a land 400 years and they'll be evily mistreated but the Lord out by a mighty hand so everything that when Moses came when a prophet came to the people and pointed to the word the true Israelites said amen here's our Prophet reveal the word let's follow him here to tell you today God done the same thing he's doing the same thing today I'm ready to follow our deliverer out of Egypt and a Third Exodus we find that Moses let's put this one up brother Mark Exodus 10:13 I might get a few of these and before we start not putting them up Exodus 10:13 and Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt now just leave that there for a moment remember that this Rod had just started out naturally it's a rod Moses found and had been a tool in his hand he'd used it for years it was the rod of Moses Moses found it Moses crafted it Moses got it however he got it it's it's a it's not even relevant the the the bottom line is it was just his rod and so it was let me say it like this it was just in his life naturally but when God called him God took ownership of that rod and the Bible says then it became then it was called the rod of God because God took ownership God you were just going through life you were you were born with what you were born with you had this tendency and that tendency you were just living your life but a voice called you aside and God looked down into your life and said now I'm taking that part of your life and it's going to be mine and I'm going to use that part in you to deliver my people so he and Moses stretched forth his Rod over the land of Egypt and the Lord brought an East Wind here it is the Lord brought an East Wind upon the land all that day and all that night and when it was morning the East Wind brought the Locust now we had we read in our text so don't go back to it brother Mark we've read it already we read in our opening text of Jeremiah that when he utth his voice there's a multitude of waters in Heavens and he causeth the vapors to ascend to the ends of the Earth he maketh Lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasure so so we found out in from our text that when he speaks even even lightning obeys him even rain obeys him and he and they bring for and he and wind we found out that wind obeys him and they bring forth his glory now let's take this one brother Mark Matthew chapter 8 verse 23 and we'll catch 23 through 27 Matthew 8:23 and when he this is Jesus Jesus was entered into a ship his disciples followed him that was a good start that's a good start wherever the Lord goes just follow him and behold there arose a great Tempest in the sea now that's surprising you wouldn't imagine that the Lord would lead you into a great Tempest but he did and then he conked out and left them on their own Lord if this is a joke it ain't funny and behold there arose a great Tempest in the sea in so much that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep and his disciples now watch his disciples came to him and awoke him saying Lord save us we perish you ever felt like that you ever just said Lord save me I'm perishing and he saith unto them why are you fearful oh ye of little faith oh what you you don't read ahead of me you think I can't save you you think just because the winds and the waves are swamping your boat and you're going to drown for sure what's the odds of us drowning about 100% so the Lord is saying you're pretty much facing 100% Calamity why are you afraid wow and he said unto them why are you fearful oh ye have little faith then he arose and rebuked the winds and the Sea and there was a great calm but the men marveled saying what manner of man is this that even the winds and the Sea obey him from the Bible in basic English translation that 27th verse reads like this and the men were were full of wonder saying what sort of man is this that even the winds in the sea do his orders my goodness we've been following this person around and sure we believed he was Messiah but I never imagined that as a man that the winds and the Sea actually obey his orders whatever he says all nature does that all nature moves I'm so glad because it moves my nature it moves your nature why are you afraid where's your faith call on the Lord all you need is his voice to rebuke the winds and rebuke the waves and I promise you peace will come it might not be peace like you'd design it but I can tell you this whatever is remaining in your life when you call on the Lord and believe him with all your heart whatever is remaining there in your life he is under complete control it obeys his orders I want you to take comfort in that today friends that no matter what we might be facing in this life when the voice when you call on the Lord out of a true heart out of a pure heart and you call upon the Lord he'll respond he will respond I I don't know what you might have to go through you know it just seems like a hop and a skip for them the storm is here they call on the Lord he wakes up rebukes it we're done but I'm quite sure that it took longer than the three or 4 seconds it took me to say it I'm quite sure that there was a lot of Tempest and tossing and fear and threaten and Calamity and and people's minds were Imagining the worst cuz they're people and that's what we do but I'm here to tell you and the Lord just seemed like he was asleep and he was but that's why brother bam said he's in your boat today he's in your boat just wake him up why why are you troubled why do you let the devil drive you to Madness just wake him up wake him up in your boat today say Lord Lord save me help me you'll be just as astonished as they were he had said to we won't bother turning to this one but God had said to Moses because Moses had his human fears and apprehensions Lord you know what if the people won't believe me and they're going to ask me who what is his name who what are you talking about somebody sent you who sent you God sent me okay what's his name say unto them I am that I am and and and that's a different I don't want to go down that Rabbit Trail but uh but but he but he but now comes the question the king of Egypt he won't hear me this Pharaoh he won't hear me and the Lord says to him and you can make a note of it and read it at home Exodus 4:8 and it shall come to pass the Lord saying that if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign they will believe the voice of the latter sign so I I read that so that you understand you get my title The Voice in the East Wind there's a voice in the sign a prophet took that very to topic the voice that's in the sign you know the voice of God in these last days and and and and and a sign overlooked and all kinds of different titles that a prophet took but but we realize you remember that even and this is unrelated direct not directly related but just as an example when God came to Cain and he says what have you done where's thy brother he said you know well what why are you asking me my My Brother's Keeper I don't keep up with him you know and the Lord said well then then why they explain this and and see if you can get out of this one why do I hear the voice of his blood crying to me from the ground see now Cain knew he's busted now there's no way to get out of it because now God knows what's happened the the voice of thy brother's blood crith out to me so so he's saying here that if they won't believe the voice of the first sign so they'll believe the voice of a second sign so God sends signs into your life please hear the voice please hear the voice for you could say for God's sake for your sake hear the voice because he doesn't speak willy-nilly he doesn't just issue out his words for no reason God values his word above his name it's valuable to him he Treasures it he guards it he watches it and if he's speaking to your life today for goodness sake hear the voice don't just think oh it's just I can just keep going and God keeps warning me and I can just keep going and God keeps warning me he won't just keep warning you there's a voice in the sign that he's trying to get your attention it's interesting that Pharaoh did not hear the voice in these signs and Moses is now going to bring forth this plague it was actually the eighth of 10 and and there was going to be an East Wind that blew all night a hot East Wind and on the hot East Wind we find that locusts were being carried as judgment to Egypt now just for contrast then when it was time to get rid of them God used a West Wind because a west wind is associated with deliverance and God used a West Wind to throw them out into the Red Sea and Destroy them see so so just have that in your mind seven plagues had hit perfectly already ready it's incredible when you read the book of Exodus and you have the first plague and the second plague and I mean it just the Lord just starts bombing them just bombing them he's turning all of their rivers and all their streams into blood and the fish are dying and the land is stinking he brings frogs up he brings lice up he brings flies and we're talking about pandemic level lice frogs and flies we're talking about this is not just something and his magicians had no answer for this he he brings you know he he brings this disease and that disease and and he one two 3 4 five six seven you would think that when Moses comes to him again and says now you've had seven king of Egypt seven is God's number of completion now let his people go and the King says I ain't doing it seven plagues had hit perfectly already and each sign that came bore a voice within that sign within that warning within that judgment there was a voice of God Pharaoh could not escape the Judgment of God because he was now under a mandate of authority by God and there was no way to get out of it and no one could get him out of it there was no higher court that could he could appeal to there was no United Nations there was no standing army there was nothing he could do even Moses couldn't help him because he was under a mandate by the word of God from a prophet and you and I'll promise you no real servant of God likes seeing Humanity suffer no servant of the Lord does my goodness they dedicate their whole life to the service of humanity no servant wants to see God's family suffer no servant wants to see anybody suffer even God doesn't take pleasure in the death of Sinners the ones who abuse him and betray him and curse him and and reject him and mock him and he doesn't even take pleasure when they destroy themselves Pharaoh was under a mandate of the word and until he obeyed it until he heard the voice and obeyed The Voice there was no escaping the judgments that were going to fall upon him and were actively falling upon him and seven had already hit perfectly and all seven each sign bore a voice within it how is it that Pharaoh how is it when the East Wind began to blow and you'd notice it because it was hot how is it that when the East Wind begin to blow Pharaoh didn't hear the voice in the East Wind how is it that you don't when you know the Lord In fairness and injustice Injustice and fairness and equity and mercy he's warning you the East Wind was a warning warning Moses had already declared you better let them go you better repent Pharaoh that doesn't mean get down at an altar like we would commonly think that means the real meaning of repentance stop turn around go the other way I'm here to tell you something friends sometimes as Believers we need to stop turn around go the other way Hallelujah because a there's a voice in the East Wind and it's clear in God's word do this and this is what happen amen so how is it that Pharaoh after after seeing God so prove his word seven times how is it that he in seeing that didn't hear the voice in the East Wind how is it that that we don't that that we don't hear the voice of the Lord when he's trying to warn us there's things in our in our lives and and God warns us to you need to get rid of that you need to deal with that you need to lay that side you need to walk away you need to separate that acquaintance you need to move from that friendship you need to change this or change that I'm here to tell you there's a voice in that warning the minister behind the pull pit begins to warn he begins to discern your life he don't know a thing about you he knows nothing of your secrets in your heart but you've sit there and we're a witness to it I've sit there and I've heard Ministry across this pulpit and the Lord warning me you better deal with this and I say yes Lord I'm going to deal with it not tomorrow today hallelujah how is it that we don't hear it how is it that the world doesn't hear the voice and the judgments that are falling and the madness that we see on the streets today it's not that as it's not as if it wasn't foretold and prophesied and a prophet told them you know 60 years ago the world will go completely ins say for one thing an East Wind seemed normal to Pharaoh it would have seemed perfectly normal in fact I did a little bit of climate research on the East winds that blow in from the Arabian Desert acrossed Egypt an East Wind and here's the results of my research an East wind blowing into Egypt from the Red Sea would tend to raise the temperature in Egypt in fact is they have an I can't pronounce it's an Egyptian word it's something like kamasan or something like that Hamas winds like the hosan that come from the East can cause temperatures to soar to Dangerously high levels often over 113 Fahrenheit with relative humidity dropping below 5% so you're in an oven you're in a hot dry Blast Furnace these winds can lead to sudden heat waves and are responsible for some of the highest temperature records in Egypt in fact now this is what astonished me the the hot East Wind in Egypt these kamasan winds or whatever that name is actually occur between late March through the end of May or sometimes there are little delay and they don't start till April and they run through June now when Moses is dealing with the Exodus they're sacrificing a pascal lamb in abib or Nissen on the Hebrew calendar you know when that is it's Easter it's Easter time it's it's like late March early April sometimes well into April so it it didn't occur to pharaoh to be afraid of the East Wind he didn't when Pharaoh felt the East Wind he was like yeah it's right on time oh Moses nah you you dumb Prophet this ain't got nothing to do with you this is normal what we see in society nah come on don't give me all that Jesus stuff this is normal oh it has nothing to do with the comic books and the TV shows in Hollywood what a bunch of hoie that's nonsense you you cultist weirdo people this is just normal this is just Evolution this is just mankind we're going to be here for thousands of years the earth will be I will be you will be they won't be because heavens and earth are going to pass away Hallelujah friends and and what might seem normal to the world they know it's crazy and kooky that but they just say well all we need to do is elect the right president all we need to do is have the FED change the rate all we need to do is to get this career all it need to do is complete my education you're you're living for a world that's dying underneath you hallelujah it's a house on fire burning to the ground and the judgments are real and they're happening in real time and they're happening to you right now what is your position do you hear the voice of the East Wind and you run to God for safety and say Lord I want to obey your word because there's no Escape except by your word thank you Lord he said that to them in Deuteronomy observe the month of abib and keep the Passover unto the Lord thy God for in the month of abib the Lord thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night so the hot wind coming in would not seem unusual to Pharaoh but little did he know that this year's hot wind would be unlike any other kamasan wind it packed a punch relative to the word of God coming forth relative to the command of the Lord that Pharaoh was under he could have avoided it he could have avoided it but it fell upon him as did the As did the ninth and the 10th plague this was number eight he'd already dealt with seven and he didn't hear the voice in the eighth and he didn't hear the voice in the n9th and he didn't hear the voice in the 10th until it was too late until finally God's will was obeyed what about you and I I hope today that you don't even need to to face an eighth or a ninth or a tenth I hope you don't need to experience one through seven you might be here today and you're sitting in the valley of decision and you're trying to make a decision about your life I'm here to tell you there's one road that leads to life there's many roads that seem like they lead to life but they lead to death and I want to say to you today choose God's word whatever you do uh don't pass go don't collect $200 go directly to God's word and say Lord let your will be manifested in my life cause me to surrender how many would say that today cause me to surrender to your word has not the word called for us to not come to the Wilderness like it called to Israel but it's called for a a a total separation from unbelief has the word called that that's the call of this day it's called us to complete dedication to the Lord so climate science does indeed provide some insights into the pH phenon described in Exodus 10 and so you know in the context of of The Exodus the East Wind would have seemed like today it would have seemed like a a natural means by which the locust swarm had been brought into Egypt they would have just dismissed it with science education politics like they're doing today they're dismissing all the calamities yeah they just dismiss it with social you know the social trends the political Trends the economic Trends oh friends second Peter let's read this one brother Mark second Peter chapter 3 Let's see if the word calls for us to ignore the voice of the impending judgments or should we be doing something about about it I want to read this and it's I'm going to read verses 2-4 it's lengthy because I want you to obsorb Simon's words now I'm not gonna quote you Jason Watkins I'm quoting you the Apostle himself St Peter amen not a saint because he died he was a saint while he was alive you have to be living to be a saint how you die that you come up the same way you go down there's no becoming a saint after you die verse two second Peter chapter 3:2 that ye may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the Commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and Savior knowing this first that there shall come in the your days am I correct there shall come in the your days all right scoffers walking after their own lust and saying everything's normal where's the promise of his coming since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation there's nothing new here there's been Wars there's been crazy people there's been bad politicians yeah there had been wind Pharaoh had felt that East Wind it wasn't the first time they had seen Locust but I'm here to tell you it had a whole Next Level effect on Egypt because it would literally spoil them to a degree they would never recover from there as a superpower their reign as a superpower would end verse four saying where's the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation are we reading about the end time don't lose sight of that verse five for this at the last day at the end time the people who are alive on the earth near the coming of the Lord willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water this he's going all the way back to Noah's destruction now they didn't believe Noah either see verse verse six whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished no kidding of course it did why cuz God said it would but nobody believed it didn't matter Noah believed it his family believed it they built an ark and they got on it verse seven but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved under Fire won't be water next time it'll be fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men but beloved are you glad to be beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years is one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise don't think that just cuz it's getting crazy and crazier don't like oh sorry I I was my my attention was divided sorry it got so crazy okay I better get you guys out of here nothing doing God if God and listen do you believe God has you here on purpose does he do anything without a purpose then you've got a purpose in being here do you believe that then what is your purpose say I don't know ask God lord what is my purpose and I promise you he'll give you the answer the the that he will give you the answer is not in question what's in question is will you do it I'll do it well what if it interrupts your program well like what what if it completely changes all your plans now hold on what does that even mean what if it causes you to lose all your friends all your career all your Prestige you lose all your likes you have to you have to completely disassociate yourself from a a life that you formerly had and walk in a new way called the newness of Christ and there are people who say my life is so bad and I am so disgusted with what I am I will take it and there are some other people who just say this is normal and I don't want to change anything please leave me alone and when you talk to God that way that's exactly what he'll do he'll give you the desire of your heart and if you desire the world and the tribulation and going to hell he'll let you do it he doesn't want you to do it he doesn't want that for you he didn't put you here and give you life for that reason hell wasn't even made for humans hell was made for the devil and his angels the hell hath enlarged itself like an overcrowded prison they had to build on new Wings to receive Humanity who wouldn't receive God starting with the days of Noah and Jesus went down and preached to them souls in prison they'd already been there for a couple thousand years almost and he said to them you ought to have listened to Noah oh save us you're the Savior not for you I was a savior my Ark that was me the ark Noah was building that was going to be me if you have believed you i' have built one big enough for you there is a family here who kept my word and I'm taking them with me when I leave Hallelujah friends I'm glad that the that the mighty Angel who has come down in our day when he leaves the Earth he's taking me with him he's taking you and I he won't leave our soul in Hell neither will he suffer our holy his holy one to see corruption verse 10 again but the day of the Lord will come it will it will it will it'll come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away shall shall with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up seeing then do you see it seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of person ought ye to be in all godl in all holy conversation and godliness see so it ain't just it ain't just Pastor Jason in your business today this is Simon Peter amen come on young people this is Peter chatting you up today seeing that all these things you see them happening why would you believe the it's the end of the story like it tells it's not going to happen so if you believe it's going to happen what are you doing what what are you doing what's your Pursuits where where's your life going what are your determinations what are you valuing we've been preaching on what do you value verse 12 looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved the elements shall melt with fervent heat that's the question nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless so this isn't just me you know trying to put you in a bad frame of mind today I'm here as an as an as an angel of Mercy I'm here to bring a warning that the Lord has brought to my heart a burden of the word for us as his people what are you doing with the word God has revealed to you you think you accidentally came into it you think you accidentally got born into this kind of a into the family you're in you think you accidentally met that believer what are the odds come on that you met a child of God some young woman met a Son of God what are the odds what some young man met a daughter of God what are the odds oh the the the the odds you know it's it's crazy what the atheist thinks and and and he even sign science proves that that I mean the the the whole universe is just hanging by almost like a thread that if even too much of this or not enough of that and the whole universe could collapse right and how is it that it just so happens to be precisely what it needs to be how how could you think there's not a a Divine mind behind that my goodness do do you think that you accidentally came into this building today do you think that was an accident there are no accidents with God's word he's here today to try to help you will you hear the voice of the East Wind that's coming upon the world it's irrevocable there's no turning back it's coming the presence of the judgments literally were aligning with historical understanding of locust migrations and the role of the wind and their dispersal so it just didn't seem odd to Pharaoh he had a way to legitimately explain it away Moses you're hysterical it doesn't mean that what you think these locusts plaguing your land yeah we get these guys saying our first rodeo get out of here you holy R ER see and so so we find that that that literally science was was acknowledging that that the wind patterns were what were playing the critical role in the movement of these Locust swarms the critical element the critical element that they were overlooking climate science told them these winds come climate science told them it's not even unusual this time of year climate science told them this is what's responsible for the Locust we can explain it and there's a whole and I'm not even going to deal with it today there's a whole I did in my research there's a whole thing I've left off of my notes about how Locust swarms and the whole dichotomy and and and the whole way it breaks down and and I didn't even want to go into the science of it today my my point is that that to them it the winds were normal the locusts were always a possibility on these East Winds what they were failing to remember the critical element that they were overlooking was that God was in control of the Winds God was in control of the Locust God was in control of the judgments his word that was declared on the ungodly nation and and and and here is the one that's Worthy of Glory the one that is Seated on the throne that all nature obeys him as the disciples said even the winds and the waves follow his orders and here his word had declared it and all nature observed it and all nature had always observed it and all nature is observing it today the East Wind in the bible let me just turn a corner and and run for the finish line here you good I want to give some more just some I'm not going to read them I'm just going to refer to them you can make a note of it we've already read about Exodus 10 how that the in verse 13 how that the East Wind the East Wind brought the plague of locust Jeremiah 18 and 17 God declares that he will scatter his own people before the enemy like an East Wind as a form of judgment his own people God loves you so much that you say he'll help me defeat the enemy not if you're not standing on his word he'll actually allow you to be scattered by the East Wind you his people he declares it this was Jeremiah's warning to Israel you think CA you've got an ark you think because you carry a Bible you think because you can pull up a prophet's quotes somehow the devil's afraid of that it's not it's not the Moses Rod was the name of Jesus for us today but Satan is not afraid of Jesus it's the life behind the name that demons fear and tremble see Ezekiel 17:10 an East Winds uh an East Wind Withers the vine and it symbolizes Israel's impending judgment Psalms 48:7 the East Wind breaks the ships of tares tares which can often be interpreted as God's Divine judgment Hosea 1315 an East Wind representing the wind of the Lord coming from the Wilderness will dry up all the springs and it will plunder all the treasures so I don't care how secure you feel today and your Springs are full and your Treasures are overflowing and you got so much water and treasure trust me the East Wind can come and dry it up and plunder all your Treasures it was even an East Wind that God appointed and Jonah 4 that that scorching East Wind that caused Jonah all of his discomfort there and we can see that as a form of a of a personal trial or a personal judgment Exodus 14 the Lord used an East Wind to part the Red Sea allowing the Israelites to escape Egypt which led to then led to the judgments of the pursuing Egyptians brother brandom said it like this that God looked at the Sea and the Sea got scared and rolled back it's whoa oh he's looking at us back up back up back up I'm here to tell you something friends let God look down in my life today let every demon fear at the view of God looking at me and looking at you I want to I I I'm happy that God is bringing judgment uh that's going to bring my Deliverance why do you want to be delivered I don't want to go to hell I don't want to be in the tribulation I don't want to do despite to the grace of Christ I don't want to serve the devil I don't want to be influenced by demons I don't there's no love I have for Hollywood there's no love I have for this for this world this broken world of Injustice and inequity where all you have to do is have enough influence and enough money you can get away with murder I don't want a society like that I want a king who's righteous who is Equitable and fair a king who will rule the Earth in Holiness I want Holiness I want Holiness I want it all around me I want it in my home I want it in my life I want it wherever I go I want the beauty of Holiness how do you want that be you were born in sin yes but I'm not in sin anymore somebody found me and made me a new creation in Christ Jesus so they show how that the East Wind is a powerful symbol of God's control over nature powerful symbol of his ability to bring judgments through it it's it's the East wind's role is is is many times in some scriptures is really a metaphor in in a Biblical narrative because it's representing it's representing God's intervention it's representing God's judgment and we find that it it also speaks of stopping or blocking or upending the futility of of human effort and human Endeavors and human plans and you know friends as much as I love you and I love you with a great love and I would never be able to endure saying some of the things that have to be said to you whom I love if it were not for a greater love that I want to see you make it and there's sometimes I just have to look out across this audience and look into your loving eyes and say you're on the wrong path your endeavors are going to bring chaos you need to change course right now you need to flip the script and don't keep going because I hear the voice of an East Wind coming the East Winds role is powerful and so whenever God is speaking in his word the East Wind in the Bible is almost always a negative thing almost always I'm not even reading them all I'm skipping just to to save time I want to close in 10 minutes but I mean there's scriptures where he talks about your crops there's drought they're scorching it just goes on and on and on job 27 let's catch this one brother Mark before we go off the air job 27 and I'll give you a couple of verses here three 19 through 21 this is such a this is sad the rich man shall lie down but he shall not be gathered he openeth his eyes and he is not Terrors take hold on him as Waters a tempest stealth him away in the night the East Wind carrieth him away and he departeth and as the storm hurth him out of his place many uh not just rich men many men many women they just went to bed like any other night the East wind was blowing they didn't hear the voice of the Lord in it they closed their eyes like they have done all their life sometimes they were in their 90s sometimes in their 40s sometimes in their teens and they closed their eyes but when they woke up and and they opened their eyes again they weren't in the world anymore something had came in the night and stolen them away an East Wind that no one heard and no one felt rolled in and just whisked their soul into eternity and they open their eyes and they found out that they are were not I was now I'm not what happened well I was no I'm not where are you uh Terrors have taken hold as Waters in Tempest and something stole me in the night the East Wind carried me away the it the the storm hurled me I I got hurled I was in my bed asleep and something came in the night that no one heard the storm and it literally lifted my soul out of my body and hurled me into Oblivion what about about the West Wind The North Wind and the south wind very quickly there's only one mention in the Bible of a West Wind and that's found there in Exodus 10 when the Lord shifted the East Wind that had brought the Locust in and the West Wind became a a wind of Deliverance and blew the Locust Locust out into the Red Sea and drowned them so so a West Wind is a deliverer of plagues The North Wind there are two references to the north wind and they're both found in Proverbs 25 where it says that the north wind brings forth terrain and and and in the and in the Song of Solomon where the north wind is said to awaken and is used poetically as the means by which the fragrance of the garden is spread so in other words we we find that this that that the west wind is a wind of Deliverance the West Wind delivers the plagues The North Wind increases your land and the north wind doesn't just give you more stuff The North Wind stir up the fragrance like a garden and your whole life becomes a fragrance of those around you oh I want a I want a North Wind hallelujah hallelujah the South Wind there are five instances of the phrase south wind and I love this they speak of the land oh my I just paused for the longest time on this five instances of the phrase south wind and they speak of the land being still job talks about it that God directed the south wind in that in Psalms 7 78 and in reference to Discerning of times if we go we don't have time today we could go to Luke 12 but literally that it's the driving of a ship by the wind you can read that in the book of Acts and so you know so you have a West Wind that is a Deliverance you have H A North Wind that literally increases your territory and and Blossoms your life out into a fruitful bow a fragrant Garden you have a North Wind which which helps to guide your life a North Wind a North Wind which uh I'm sorry a south wind which which causes the land to be still or it drives you forward so it's whatever God as long as God's in control sometimes God is moving your ship across the water and sometimes God just gives you peace sometimes you're not moving at all but sometimes it's a peace that passes all understanding you might even be in the middle of a trial you might be in the middle of Affliction but there's peace oh Hallelujah there there there's also this I want to get you this one before we go there is that we found out in job 15 there is the filling oneself with the East Wind now we're back to the East Wind because that's what they accused jobab he had all this flowery speech trying to explain you know trying to defend himself is what he was doing and he he wasn't giving God the glory that God deserved and job was lifting up his own self and and this beautiful oratory and and and one of the accusers basically accused him of filling himself with the East with the East Wind job uh 15:22 should a wise man utter vain knowledge and fill his belly with the East Wind th in this term it simply meant that job's words blew hard but they were useless they were boisterous and bold and they made a lot of noise bless God bless God I have blessed god well I'll tell you right now and it all is useless the reality was that job was in trouble and until job could understand God's position in the trial and humble himself all it is he's just full of hot air sometimes Believers get like that and they they Thunder around and stomp around and they they make uh proclamations and I'll tell you I got faith for this and I got faith for that and bless God I've been a Believer all this and and a lot of times what you need instead of standing up beating the air you need to fall on your face and say God Take Me Away From Here re come and come into my life and change me completely that's what job needed it meant words that are they blow hard but they're useless words that sound great but have no purpose in other the words vain knowledge windy knowledge the world is full of it the world is filled with windy knowledge vain knowledge vain worship but there is a true worship there is a true Living God there is a true knowledge and it might contradict everything the world is telling you and my advice to you today is forsake the world and follow the word that's the only source of life that there is people sometimes don't realize the futility now I'm just I'm done with our scriptures can I just give you my heart for five or 10 minutes am I've preached this whole sermon to come to this part and I'm at the bottom of my notes people sometimes God's own family sometimes I've been guilty of it myself sometimes we don't realize the futility of filling ourselves with the East Wind making all these bold declarations and you know brother Brown comes to the end of his sermon and and he says now how many enjoyed the word tonight you can hear on the tape you can hear all the audience oh hallelujah amen he says all right now I'm glad you enjoyed it he said but now my real question see it was a trick question he he let them in did you enjoy it yes all right now my real question will you do it will you go out of here today and do it otherwise you're not hearing the voice in the East Wind because I promise you the East Wind is coming it's not even coming it's here it's blowing on the Earth right now and it's not going to go away that that East Wind was just another precursor to Egypt's complete undoing God is going to to take his family out of the earth and because she's the B in word because the she has the life and the word is in her she has the token life as brother Matt was preaching for us Wednesday when the bride leaves the Earth the blood leaves the Earth and then God sees the Earth with all of its sin and we're not here he that lth will let till he be taken out of the way when the bride goes Mercy goes with it the blood goes with it and you don't want to be here friends I promise you you don't want to be here and sometimes people don't realize the futility of filling themselves with the East Wind and the reason for this happening a lot of time is very logical a lot of it it really comes down to life is just too short it's just too short and so by the time the judgment is realized it's already upon you because your life is just a vapor you you know trust me I know what I'm talking about one day you're 20 and the next day you're 60 and it just takes a few days and you can you can hardly believe it in your mind you don't feel like that but but you look in the mirror and tell my goodness what happened how did I get here and so because life is so short and then people don't they they don't realize a lot of times the futility of all of their bold dreams their bold plans which are contrary to this they they're certainly agree in agreement with the world but they're very much in in in in in contrary to this but because their life is so short by the time the judgment is realized it's already on them they're not they're not able to comprehend let me let me just say it to you how I how I said it to myself they're not able to comprehend the High Altitude view that God looks from to set their priorities correctly see he's trying to set your priorities correctly because he's way up here yeah and your life is down here at Ground Zero and it's very short it's a blip on the radar and before you know it you're done before you know it you're already in the midst of East Wind and you don't even know how you got there and and and but but but a lot of times people can't comprehend that high altitude view that God looks from and it can't occur to them that consequences not often not seeable for DEC decades formed within the decade they're in you get me seeds of discrepancy if you forget everything I've said today remember this one seeds of discrepancy which is anything contrary to these seeds Jesus called this a seed it's good seed you put it in the ground it'll grow seeds of discrepancy are when you when you change this seeds of discrepancy are the most reliable crop you can plant they don't even require Faith to make them come up the sinful Fallen World you live in will bring them to harvest with or without your cooperation this is exactly why that a high altitude view of God's prophets are so valuable this is why God warns his people through prophets because like eagles prophets are called Eagles they're the ones who are built by the Lord to fly high enough to see the regrets you'll have when you fill your life with the East Wind I hope today that just maybe you could be so impacted by this service and this sermon that you will say Lord I don't want East Wind in my life I I want West Wind I want Deliverance I I I want North Wind I want the fragrance of your life I want a south wind I want peace in my life I don't want an East Wind I want a North Wind I want a West Wind I want a south wind how many today would say that to the Lord say Lord grab me West Wind if I'm if I'm in a fix and I've got myself in a fix send me the West Wind deliver me take this plague out of my life bring me a south wind that brings peace in my life bring me a south wind that'll drive my ship across the life sea bring me a North Wind that'll cause my territory to expand and and not just expand but my life will become a fragrance a fragrance of righteousness a fragrance of Holiness you want the joy of the Lord that's your strength let the Lord pour upon you the oil of gladness today let the Lord come in and change your whole life and say I'll take the East Wind away hear the voice in it respond and I'll bring West Wind I'll bring North Wind I'll bring south wind and you'll never have to have the East Wind again oh Grant it to me Lord stand on your feet with me how many would want that today say Lord God may I never never be a victim of the East Wind again oh Hallelujah Lord Jesus today Lord we've spent time in this word and we've proven to the people back and forth back and forth through the scriptures Lord all through the Old Testament I didn't even hardly get into the New Testament passages we could have went to but Lord we realize this world is falling apart it's going to Ash and Cinder Lord oh I wish the people could see that it's going to Ash and Cinder I don't care what you're chasing it's going to Ash and Cinder Lord I want North Wind in my life I want West Wind in my life I want South Wind in my life I don't want East Wind all heads bowed now all hearts and heads bowed before the Lord Lamb of God Father of Lights creator of heavens and earth and all that is all good things come down from above from you the Father of Lights in you Lord there's no Shadow there's no variableness you're you're always the same you're so reliably the same you always respond to repentance you always respond to a contrite heart you love a contrite heart that's what job needed and he was your child that's what Pharaoh needed he never got it he refused I know the Bible says the Lord hardened his heart but that's only be that was only a consequence of the seeds of discrepancy of 400 years of evily mistreating God's people that se that crop had to grow Pharaoh did that to himself only thing God did in hardening his heart was caused this nature to take its course and and that seed came forward and Pharaoh became a victim of his own tyranny did that to himself just like the world will the world will do it to them M themselves Lord you won't destroy the Earth you love the Earth you won't destroy people you you'll move out of the way finally and let them have at it and they'll annihilate their own self from the face of the Earth Lord but high up in the atmospheres somewhere beyond the blue there will be a people standing with you rejoicing to say I chose the way with the Lord's despised few I made a change in my life I came to my senses I heard the voice in the East Wind the world didn't hear it my other friends didn't hear it but I heard it it called to me the child you don't have to suffer that this this judgment you can avoid it you don't have to suffer it this plague you can move you can come to me that's what Moses said all who are on the Lord's Side come to me I thank you Lord God for a high altitude prophet in this day who could see these things who could give me understanding of what I'm seeing the Holy Spirit could reveal it to my heart and all these things were the love of God but yet at the end of the day I still had to choose I still had to accept your unconditional pardon Lord you'll never condemn a man for being a sinner you'll never do that the man was born a sinner you you're you're not unjust the man was born a sinner he didn't even volunteer to come that way according to St Paul he was subjugated to that you'll never condemn a man for being a sinner he was born a sinner what will condemn the man or the woman the boy or the girl is is that they remained a sinner when they didn't have to God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever would believe in him would not perish but have everlasting life I send out this prayer
