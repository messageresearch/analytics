TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] can we sing it one [Music] my desire [Music] for anything that is of me i want more of you and last of me empty hands me fill me lord fill me with you amen give the lord a hand this morning praise the lord i sure appreciate that song i find it rather remarkable that brother kenny would sing that it's so conducive to my sermon this morning i think brother kenny better be prepared to sing it again after i finish preaching when we call you back up amen just quite a bit of confirmation to me amen we greet you in the name of the lord we're happy to be here today sister hannah hope is about to become two people so i think she's she's six months in maybe something like that it seemed like i heard that number and so um amen we're looking forward to welcoming a new member into our family pretty soon we had a really nice time appreciate all your prayers i know you were thinking of us i was really enjoying the wednesday night service appreciated brother diggs thought there amen and so enjoyed enjoyed our time away all i need now is a vacation to recover amen praise the lord but it's all good i'm just looking to what the lord has for us today there's a number of families who are also awake traveling brother matt and his family are away ministering i think brother anthony is away i i seen a message from him earlier he's away with his family i suppose and so other different ones also a man looks like the part of my family that went with me on vacation didn't quite make it to service this morning amen but i'm wild horses couldn't have kept me away amen i wanted to be here amen i wanted to see everybody and minister in the word of god sure appreciate the brothers carrying on and i understand there was a breakfast saturday morning i believe and i believe brother don you were telling me there was a prayer meeting saturday evening amen so praise the lord i appreciate that amen matthew chapter 5 we're just going to read one and matthew chapter 5. we're just going to read one brief verse here and you pray for my throat a little bit it's just sinuses and different things coming back from a flight i'm always battling that a little bit get on that metal tube and amen they say it's purified air but i always come back with a problem so i don't know praise god matthew chapter 5 just want to catch um you know let's just i just really want to catch one verse and we're going to let you be seated straight away verse 48 matthew chapter 5 verse 48 be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect amen if you could put my title screen up then brothers and i'll control it from up here let's pray father we thank you for your word this morning i just was so inspired lord listening to the sunday school class and hearing the worship service this morning i have a rather simple and direct thought today lord with just a single verse it might seem rather under achieving to just read one verse but lord when it's a verse out of your word it's greater than all heavens and earth would pass away before that single verse would pass away so we know that little is much if god is in it so we have many other scriptures to refer to today but we wanted to just begin with this simple direct uh command from you when you were here i have i pray you open the eyes of our understanding today that we might see lord what it is that you've burdened my heart with and it's a joyous thing lord we want to teach it correctly we want to believe the right thing but once we get there my goodness i've been so thrilled lord just studying it and it just is such a reassurance to me this dark hour lord where the enemy lord is seemingly on every hand and has permeated every bit of society and every our whole everyday lives lord we spend on this earth that's falling apart but what a provision you have given us in your word lord that we can live above it and rise above it and be above it and be recognized by you as above it even lord and it's so secure and your plan is so brilliant that even if we do stumble at times it doesn't even count against us we're still considered in the image in the vision of christ we're considered perfect so what a plan lord i just say what a plan lord i thank you for it now i surrender myself fully just gonna go along as i feel led i committed to you in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated praise the lord amen now i wish by the help of the lord to bring this thought to you today be perfect i i want to um i'm going to kind of jump ahead of myself here i can already see i'm going to need to do that we'll then we will we will back up uh once i can get this guy up and moving so all right so do we have power to this little guy it would help if i turn it on yeah okay okay josh yeah okay praise the lord now i should have fire in the hole all right yeah here we go now i want i'm going to come back to this we read this actually in the last service and i want to come back to it intentionally there's there's where we read this morning be you therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now i'm i'm going to take matthew 5 and then we're going to follow it here with hebrews 10 1-17 now thank you brother kenny now the reason that i'm doing this thanks sir the reason that i'm doing this is because then i'm going to take you to a quote where brother branham ties these two scriptures together and gives you clarity of thought between them that'll be all right all right so now we read here be there for perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect i i love the statement that brother branham made one time and i don't have it up here this morning but brother branham quoted this one time and said you know how can you even i mean when you look at that you go okay i might as well never mind because i'll just never be able to achieve that so i might as well eat drink and be merry right well wrong the the i want to say to you that it's made impossibly hard on purpose it's made impossible on purpose god made it in such a way that there's no way you can do it on purpose which means you can't save yourself by any amount of works you would ever do you can't save yourself by any mental assent or no matter what you would ever confess with your lips god still has to achieve your perfection all right so there's there's none perfect and the only one that is was jesus christ that you know paul deals with with that quite a bit in other places in the scripture particularly if you want to have some nice reading today go home and have a fresh read of paul's letter to the romans especially chapters three and four where he really paul takes chapters 3 and chapter 4 of romans to just basically tell us that we're all guilty going to hell and no way to escape it because there's none of us any good and there's never been anybody any good except one amen that we're all open sepulchers we're all liars we're all deceitful there's there's none good no not one a lot of times we can you you can think well you know god will accept me because i'm a pretty good person he won't do that say well god will accept that person because they're a pretty good person he won't do that either god has one provided way to accept a fallen man and that's through the atonement of the blood of christ there is no other approach there is no other way only through the blood of christ now what's what what satan has never been able to catch this satan has never been able to get the christian church to go blind to that for millennia multiple millennia all christians believe that that we are saved by the blood of the lord jesus christ by the atonement by the sacrifice by the death burial and resurrection of christ amen but what satan has been successful in doing we've been preaching on he's been very successful in obscuring what what fully the blood of jesus is and what is it about his blood that redeemed you now it becomes apparent and i don't think anybody could argue with this and if you can i'd sure welcome you to stand up and tell me so i mean that quite sincerely i'm going to make this statement no one has the blood of jesus not that chemistry not the blood that flowed through his veins no one has it do you have it i don't have it does the vatican have it is it in jerusalem somewhere is there a secret vial somewhere of his blood well then how are you ever going to be redeemed you can't even get his blood you have no chance to get it because that chemistry flowed down the cross and fell on the earth and claimed the earth all right and but but the but the secret to being redeemed is that jesus said drink this cup it is my blood in the new testament and when you realize what came in the new testament it was the holy ghost which was him now satan obscured that by making people think it's a third person it's not it's the same person see so we find then that john satisfies the whole argument by a great revelation under an eagle anointing because he was that he represented that fourth living guardian the eagle anointing that's why john picks up things the other writers don't even get and and so so we realize that john gives us a clue to say in the beginning say in the beginning was god no in the beginning was the word you understand there was a time when god that being was not worshipped there was no one to worship him but he was always the word you follow me he was always that divine being he was always that person but at one point he's all alone he doesn't even have angels to even sing his praises until he creates them you understand so this is why jesus would say heavens and earth will pass away but not one of my words will pass away because the word or the logos is god simply in a form and when it and when and and when he merged himself into that pillar of fire that pillar of fire became a son of god by designation because it went from one position into another and it became from two you got me but it's only a designation it didn't make a second person so the pillar of fire that led the children of israel wasn't a second god he was the very same one that promised abraham see but when he came to promise abraham catch what he did he comes as a human being and it's all the same person you understand so so when we when we find out that how do we access the blood of god the only way to do that the only the only way to do that is through the word of god by believing the word of god by accepting when you accept the word of god you're accepting god and that's why john would say if we walk in the light of the word as he is in the word then we have fellowship one with another why because we're all born again of the same spirit amen we're all born of the same being we have fellowship one with another you don't have fellowship with the family of god if you're outside of the new birth you can be friends to them you could be neighbors with them you could be acquaintances you can be human blood kin but you're not in the family of god because you can't join that and that's where satan obscured it to the churches down through the ages they thought you could join that and be baptized and put your name on a role and doesn't do you any good at all you have to be as jesus said to nicodemus born again amen and we're going to show you that the new birth has always come acceptance before god has always come by receiving his word amen and no man ever found acceptance before god by rejecting any part of his word it is impossible to do because that's the access to him amen because you don't have his blood but if we walk in the light as he's in the light then we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus cleanses us from sin there is a chemistry blood there is a a physical body and that body lays on lays on the mercy seat brother venom said that body lays there and there's a perpetual atonement the voice of that blood speaking for me speaking for you but how do you access it because you're here and it's there so how are you going to get any value in it by faith in the word nothing more faith plus nothing no works no accomplishments it means nothing to god he can't use any of your works all your works or filthiness to him your best effort you understand and so he makes it completely impossible so that he's the only one who can do it for you and you gain access to it by receiving his word and that's never not been true when abel received acceptance by god did abel receive acceptance by god because he slew a lamb and did works or because or was it more than that was it because he received a revelation to slay a lamb and slaying the lamb was only a testimony of his faith his works followed his faith not the other way around you see what i'm saying so it wasn't just his physical slaying of a lamb but but what he because cain could have done that but cain refused the revelation you understand and therefore he had no works that were willing to follow that cain wanted to stay his own thinking in his own way and there's there's the rub that's why jesus said that straight is the gate narrow is the way and few there'll be that find it however broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many shall go therein despite god making it as easy and simple as could possibly be be made and that is to just surrender being you and let him come in and be him in you and then when when you can find that place mentally to ex it's not about accepting doctrine it's not just that it's it's it's accepting the change that he'll make in your life that's mentally as far as you can go because a lot of times you come to god when you first come to god you don't even understand the doctrines you haven't even been you haven't read the doctrines so it's not about agreeing with all the doctrines the holy spirit will lead you and guide you to all truth you don't have to worry about that you understand but what it is is is not just accepting of mentally accepting the doctrines but it's mentally accepting to stop being you and let him become alive in you so that you're willing to give up your life and when you do that then that kind of repentance makes you a candidate for the holy ghost and then the what is the holy ghost it's god coming down as a sign as a seal god is testifying i i accept your faith it's pure it's a hundred percent you're not trying to be half me and half you or ninety percent me and ten percent you you're willing to completely die and let me have complete control of your life therefore i'm gonna give you the holy ghost to seal you in that's the holy ghost that's what the holy ghost is given for and paul breaks that down in romans three and four where he he starts talking about you know these sacrifices and things that they bring and he pricks up abraham and he says you say oh you've got to be circumcised he said okay well did abraham receive the promise before circumcision or after circumcision well none of those jews won't answer that one because then they trapped themselves because obvious he received it before he was ever circumcised he was circumcised because he received it and accepted it and god gave him the seal as a sign that his faith was true see and it didn't matter at that point at that point it didn't matter what anybody believed about abraham and it didn't even matter if abraham failed afterward and he did numerous times none of that mattered because now abraham's righteousness was imputed to him and couldn't be taken back couldn't be reversed see he believed god paul said and god imputed righteousness unto him so so it's it's by faith through grace amen not not of works not of him that willeth or him that runeth it's god that showeth mercy let me tell you something friends the the getting the new birth isn't difficult getting the baptism of the holy ghost isn't difficult satan will have you chasing something have you chasing some mental i i think it must be some emotion or i must have to have this or i must it must it you know if i make this mistake i must not have it none of that that's all just smoke and mirrors that's all the devil trying to confuse and stir up the water you understand so god has sent his presence into the world by his word and from your whole mind and your whole heart and soul you have said amen to every word and that means that you're saying lord here's what it means for me lord i i'm i'm not perfect and i don't always live perfect but i have a perfect acceptance that i want to have your life in me i have a perfect acceptance of your holiness i want it i chase it i crave it i desire it if i fail i'll repent then i'll go again because i am completely i'm all in i'm all in i'm all in and whatever you have to change in my life change it and if i'm holding on to something and won't let it go rip it from me by any means necessary lord cause me at every point and every turn to obey your word i can't ever exactly get this here in the flesh but i can sure have that in my faith i can have a perfect faith and i do see you thought perfect faith was just to speak squirrels into existence perfect faith is what gives you the new birth perfect faith in the word of god that's that when you have perfect faith in god's word that's when you walk down the street and demons howl and faint when you have perfect faith that's when you say to this mountain be moved why because god unctioned you to do it not because you decided to do it you've already stopped being you understand so it's never about trying to figure out i'm going to go do this i'm going to have this i'm going to accomplish this has nothing to do with that all you'll do is run around and make a big bunch of noise and have a bunch of confusion fall on your face discourage yourself and a lot of people watching you listen friends it's not difficult it's faith in the word faith alone in the word because you have received the message of the hour because you have believed the report because you have received him whom god hath sent all right now that's quite a mouthful i better be able to prove it right all right so then we're going to come to our our next passage hebrews 10. now let's take a reading for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things could never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there and to perfect now just read that this way for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the and not the new birth can never with all my works which i offer continually make me perfect amen all right for because that's an old testament version and i just gave you the new testament version all right for then would they not have ceased to be offered i mean if you could have perfected your life good enough to be accepted by god then why would jesus even have to have died well i'm gonna i'm gonna make it a requirement that because i see that there will be people who'll become perfect but i'll send jesus anyway to pick up the stragglers that's not how it works all right for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience of sin there is what the holy ghost is trying to get to verse 2 look at it zero in on it paul is paul is prophesying he's showing look you were chasing you were chasing this you love this that you have no more conscience of sin that's the whole plan right i'll take out the stony heart and put in a heart of flesh i'll cause them to keep my word amen don't you want your desires changed you don't want to have to live as a christian life by gritting your teeth do you you don't want to you don't want to have just enough religion to make you miserable do you well good news the gospel didn't come for that the gospel came to change your nature the word came to change your nature the word came to take away conscience of sin in other words all desires of sin you can finally be free you can finally be free that you can finally live after the ordinances of god amen and and if we sin john said we have an advocate see but he that's born of god doth not commit sin why because he has no more conscience of sin that evil nature's gone it's annihilated ain't never coming back you're born again you've already passed from death to life you can never come into the judgment so it's not about a checklist of wins and losses stop letting the devil put you under that kind of tyranny you're going to do wrong let me give you a direct quote you're going to do wrong you'll willfully do wrong it doesn't mean you're not a son it means a rod of correction is coming amen and i just say thank god for the rod thank the lord that he corrects me see and so so so we find then that paul is actually trying to get him to understand if if sacrifices could have done it then wouldn't they have ceased to be offered why'd you have to keep doing it every year why jews hey you hebrews you hebrews why'd you have to keep doing it every year because it never removed your desire for sin did it and the hebrews all go right because it couldn't but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance of gin made of sins every year for it's not possible that your works could save you amen amen it's not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins wherefore when he come and this is why when he came into the world he said sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not that was not jesus desire then and it's not his desire now but a body has thou prepared me what a sacrifice once and for all a body i'll give my body as a sacrifice i will live in my body perfectly i will accomplish matthew 5. i said it be you perfect but i wasn't requiring any of my family to live flawlessly i was saying i will live flawlessly on your behalf and when you accept me and my person not as a mental acceptance only of teaching and doctrine but when you accept my person in the holy ghost i will come in and destroy all your old desires of sin and i will i will you'll pass from death to life and even if you do sin it won't count against you because the blood is already speaking [Music] the blood speaks before i fall when i fall after i fall amen amen so it it hits that bumper that surrounds that bloody bumper that can never reach god see wherefore when he cometh into the world he said sacrifice and offering thou what is not but a body has thou prepared me and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure no satisfaction god never got his family where he his back to to the garden of eden pre-fall by sacrifices and offerings of blood of bulls and goats he never accomplished that you understand and he was it was it was the benevolence of god don't read ahead of me it was the benevolence of god that even offered us a substitute god didn't have to do that god god was the offended party god hadn't done anything wrong man had made a choice against god's word god built a perfect world people want to blame god for the cruelty of sin and mankind brought on the cruelty of sin it blows my mind and you think you think god doesn't it doesn't break his do you think the cruelty of sin and seeing children suffering and seeing wars and men blow up and you think that doesn't break the heart of god you think you know god is just ambivalent he just stands off and he's just uncaring and unarrested no friends from the very from the very beginning he agreed to accept a substitute until one day he could come and give his own life that was the love of god god didn't have to do that god did that god allowed them to slay an animal and then god would would would not would not bring about the judgment he paul said he just kept passing it off he passed over judgment passed over judgment because he knew someday i'll pardon him completely so he passed over judgment based on what he would do in the future you understand so when his family died they went to paradise amen so he passed over judgment waiting for the time when he could come himself and be the perfect human and then all you have to do is approach that human approach that sacrifice by faith and recognize that the the christ on the cross and the christ in this book are the same person amen and so it becomes ridiculous to accept the one on the cross and refuse this one you understand that's what the world that's what the devil has been successful in getting the christian church in an old in an overwhelming majority to believe see but but you but you but you find that it it doesn't it doesn't pan out and and and we're going to keep proving that all right so and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thousands had no pleasure then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o god above when he said sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and offerings for sin thou wouldst not neither has pleasure in them which are offered by the law then said he in other words more than that beyond that he said lo i come to do thy will o god he taketh away the first because of the way he said that that in sacrifices and offerings that's not my main plan i come to do thy will i come to be a propitiation for the people i come to live the perfect example and because he's saying it like that then paul is saying that he taketh away the first this is what he's trying to get those hebrews to understand he takes away the the first that he may establish the second amendment amen so what what that that's what uh the the message of every hour has been able to accomplish to bring a fresh kill of the word to do away with the former and establish the new the problem is people stayed in the former and that's what destroyed them amen that's that's what cain wasn't willing to do he wasn't willing to go on in the word amen you understand so god's no respecter of persons but when abel caught caught what god was after and abel examined it and thought blood yeah that makes sense because realizing what happened in the garden yep that adds up because life's in the blood so i get it and he goes and gets the lamb and brings the lamb and then god accepts his sacrifice just like when you repented and you repented and you came to an altar and said yeah my life was no good i get it all my works of no value to god the only way i can get it is to accept him and let him come into my heart and make me a new creation okay i get it lord and then god accepts that faith you receive the holy ghost you're born again and then the holy ghost keeps leading you in guiding you into a truth you understand that see so so he says verse 10 by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all right and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sin for sins forever sat down on the right hand of god from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and into their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more this is why jesus could so confidently say that he that heareth my word and believeth on to him that hath sent me hath everlasting life and shall never come into the judgment because it's once for all see you don't have to keep getting re-saved every time you make a mistake see now you you would think that everybody would take that deal i mean that's like a slam dunk that's like a no-brainer i didn't got to think about that you mean to tell me okay let me get this straight i come to christ i get rid of my stinky old self that gets on my nerves and i hate my fallen desires and i i i i i want to be a better person i've made horrible mistakes it's too late i can't even fix them and you're telling me that christ is going to come first he's going to remove all ever he's going to blank out every transgression i ever committed every one of them yep and then he's going to put me in a position to where i receive his life so that now i can have the kind of holiness and righteousness i always wanted to be and then moreover you're telling me that even if i do make a transgression you're actually telling me i will and that when i do not if i do but when i do it won't even count against me amen yep sign me up as brother ernie would say sign me up you say well everybody would take that deal but the overwhelming majority overwhelming by by orders of magnitude don't take that deal and the reason is because of the one in the middle that they don't want their life changed everybody loves the notion of having their sins emitted and being immune from prosecution going forward everybody would love to have diplomatic immunity and and i don't got to pay for anything i've ever done and i can never be charged for anything i ever do everybody wants to take that deal but they don't want the middle deal that says all right i have to die and let him be reborn in me you see see what i'm saying that's the rub but yet it's to me that's the best part of the deal to me friends that's the best part of the deal i wouldn't care listen if if i knew that i had eternal life in the fallen condition and that nothing i've ever done i'll ever have to pay for and nothing i ever do will ever have to pay for but yet i still have to walk around with with evil desires and filthy thoughts and horrible and i could never uh overcome and never be i i wouldn't want that deal at all i'd say good grief shoot me now get get it over with send me into oblivion blank me dissolve me i don't want to live like that to me to live is to live as christ amen to live as christ if i'm going to live then i i want to live for christ that's my desire if there was never a heaven i'd still want to live for christ because it's a better life and i would enjoy it more amen so even if there was no next life so now we find then watch this let me see where yeah so then brother branham comes along and picks this up the water of separation now he's going to catch matthew 5 be therefore perfect and he's going to catch what we just read in hebrews 10. god looking through the blood he doesn't see you no more as a sinner he sees you redeemed i could just say musicians come let's let's dismiss and go home that right there would be enough you're redeemed because he's always sees you through christ that's the reason we can be perfect not perfect in the sense of sinless we're perfect in the eyes of god when we're in christ that's the reason he said there's matthew 5 be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect paul now he goes to hebrews paul in the 10th chapter of hebrews trying to explain the law having a shadow of good things to come not the very image of the things could never make the comer unto perfect because god was looking through animal blood but now he looks through the blood of his son perfection come by jesus christ not beautiful now i'm not perfect in your sight you may not be perfect in my sight you're not but what about in god's sight uh we should just have a jubilee i mean we should just have a jubilee to say i already know you know brother jason you're not perfect no kidding i already know that thanks for telling me you're not perfect either but in god's sight we're both perfect hallelujah there's where it lays where where where in god's sight see and if you're born again into the body of christ then god looks upon you as perfect as christ was himself amen nothing you can do it's not by any works you can do at all it's by grace god has given you this offer and if you've accepted it in the sight of god you are perfect redeemed washed in the blood of the lamb without fault without blemish without spot isn't that marvelous this is what the word of god would do now okay now let me let me let me back up and show you now you're going to understand why i read this quote to you last time out of the thyatiran church age because now let me explain what the show you what the enemy has been able to do to the nominal church world he says now brother branham is referring to revelation chapter 2. remember we read i don't need to keep going back over all this down to verse 23 and you see proof again of the of a great truth i have been bringing to your attention all along and i will kill her children with death and all the churches see see that word church is plural churches so it meant there's more than one by the time this is written there's more than one now in the original there was only one church of the living god it didn't matter if it was in jerusalem or if it might it might be in thessalonia thessalonica it might it might be a church in rome it might be any anywhere you understand but it it could be in antioch it could be anywhere but it was all one church see but now there's churches because now there has been the beginning of a deceptive thing that looks like a church and satan pulled it off and the people believed it because why why why why because their deeds are evil and they don't want that changed all right watch i will kill our children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he would certainly searcheth the reigns and hearts i've been saying right along there are actually two churches though the spirit speaks to both of them in each age as though they were but one here it is plainly stated that there are churches and it states just as plainly that some of those churches most evidently do not know that he is the one who searcheth the reins and the hearts he is going to prove to them that it is so now then what churches will be those that do not know this truth of course it is the false vine group because the true believers certainly know that judgment begins at the house of god amen you don't you don't argue that do you see so i so i i if i come here and the lord anoints me with a scolding sermon and scours us all out and smashes sin in the head and gets down into your personal life is it okay does judgment begin at the house of god so we don't need to worry about political correctness here right this is the last place in the world you want to be politically correct all right because politics are of the devil see he's a living god all right watch and he's a consuming fire so he says here of course so the the true believers certainly know judgment begins at the house of god and they being god fearing judged themselves that they be not judged we read that in our communion service out of the book of corinthians now why does god call these churches his churches even though they are the false vine the truth of the matter is that they are christians of course there would be see watch but they are not christians of the spirit they are christians of the flesh they are bearing they are bearing the name in vain according to mark 7. amen jesus taught that that they would bear his name in vain how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrine doctrines the commandments of men but indeed they are christians for what else could they be a muhammad and as a mohammed and that is his religion no matter how he lives it because he subscribes in theory to what the quran teaches isn't that simple it's like wow i love that brother branham didn't leave things complicated in the same way a christian is a christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that jesus is the son of god born of a virgin was crucified and died and rose again and that is the savior of mankind etcetera in fact in the later sea and age there will be those who call themselves christians because they subscribe to the fine qualities of jesus while reserving to themselves there's the catch while reserving to themselves the right to deny his deity see christian science have done that already as well as multitudes who preach a social gospel he is a nominal christian and belongs to the church but he's not a true or spiritual believer that kind of a believer is one who has been baptized into the body of christ and is a member of him but nonetheless it is in god's order that the tares grow up with the wheat and they are not to be uprooted that is the command of god their day for binding and burning is coming but not yet so the spirit is speaking to this mixed group on the one hand he is praising and on the other hand he is rebuking i mean god's not bipolar i said that to you last time he's not having an on day and an off day he doesn't wake up on the wrong side of the bed all right so he's one group he's praising the other he's rebuking he has told what is right and here all i remember now i forgot about that i remember keying on this last time he has told what is right with the true believer now he warns what the false vine must do if it is to stand justified before the lord so here he's got a false vine who won't take his way and he's in in great love and great compassion warning them look just like he warned cain gave cain an opportunity tried to get judas to reconsider his thought god's not trying to destroy anybody he's trying to save everybody you understand but he has a provided way and you have to come god's provided way you can't come your way your way is no good and and and i would say friends that that this is this should be the cornerstone of our outreach amen if you've got an outreach that that is not establishing that to the people what what is the point do you want them to come around and just think because you know that that they can sit and hear a sermon preached and smile and shake the preacher's hand and say oh i really enjoyed that or enjoy all all the singing i mean that's not hard to do we have fantastic song leaders i see people come in here and you can you you certainly can see that the spirit of god doesn't dwell on them and they they they go into another realm just a whole nother realm these worship leaders we have just take them right into another realm and but it doesn't change their life they their opinion is well that was a really great sermon that was a really great song service that was a really great worship service but you understand that the cornerstone of what we believe is that it requires faith plus nothing but it has to be a true faith it has to be a real faith that god recognizes as a real faith not just a mental ascent and a historical act but it requires that you come through the bleeding word amen now the beauty of it is and this is really my thought today i'm going to take several scriptures and prove what i've just said out of the bible because if we can't prove it out of the bible we shouldn't be up here so but the the beauty of this whole sermon because i've already spent plenty of time i already spent three services in the last series i did telling you about the great lie that's been you know put on the world remember that we we dealt with that with that great deception i'm not preaching on that today i i'm preaching on the beauty the beautiful side of it is that when you accept god in his revealed word he changes your whole life sets you free from sin you get to be a real christian you get to be a real new creation nothing you've ever done counts and nothing you ever do will count you've got a heaven waiting a body as soon as this earthly tabernacle be dissolved i have one already waiting what is that a word body what built it the word do you think you're going to inhabit a word body disbelieving this word how would you get that word it was the word that created the heaven then when jesus said i go and prepare that he was the word how would you get a word prepared place and a word built body by rejecting any part of his word amen see but when people don't want to change they'll lie to themselves and they'll accept the most thing that's the most convenient so that they can keep their lie and sleep at night and they will heap to themselves teachers who have itching ears to tell them what they want to hear and tell them that they won't brother branham you know i had i had a you know you and i'm sure you've encountered it too where say you know william branham was a false prophet i say well i get why you need to believe that you better hope that's true you better hope it's true because if he if if he was a true prophet you're doomed so he said that to even preachers to say listen william branham said concerning paul's teaching about a woman not cutting her hair and he and brother branham speaking in the third person says woman women will say well my preacher says there's nothing wrong with that and brother branham said he'll suffer for it in the regions beyond that he told her that jeremiah 23 makes that clear that's why god ripped them down and tore them down and put christ over him as a shepherd because they told the people that was the thing that bent god the most that that was he he wasn't angry at ignorance he was angry at iniquity because they were telling the people go ahead and sin it won't matter god won't care and when god heard that he said that's it i am done with these false shepherds and false prophets and i'm going to tear them right out of their position and i'm going to put somebody over them who will tell them my truth because i know i i know by jeremiah 23 that if my job is one single job it is definitely not to you know kiss the babies and bury the dead and baptize the ungodly you know i have a life and and i'm i move among you i am a human i love people we fellowship we're brothers we're one and one together amen my family and your family all right but that's not my job my job my commission is to stand in his presence and if i stand in his presence then he promises me that's all he needs me to do just to stand in his presence and then he through me will cause you to hear his word and if you hear his word not my word his word then you'll go free from your sins i have no other job in the world but that one amen see so i stand in his presence and i come here as a conduit of his word and when and i have this confidence that and that's why i don't fall all to pieces over your failures and over my failures because i know that as we hear his word it keeps washing us clean and it will take you to a body change and then you won't have these problems anymore hallelujah oh my i i i'm in an unredeemed body and i i'm i am a wretched man who will deliver me i thank god through jesus christ i will someday be free of this body of death see so we'll just have to stay wretched people wretchedly in love with one another praying for one another abiding with one another uh interceding for one another amen so when we when we all right now take take that down brother josh and i'm going to give you a workout in the in the in the bible take my slide down i'm going to i'm out of time so i'm just going to go through these all right and we'll stop we're going to start in matthew 13. i got maybe a half a dozen i'm just going to give you make a quick comment take me 10 minutes you good so matthew 13. now what am i what am i about to prove you need to know that you need to know what to look for all right i'm going to prove to you what i keep saying that acceptance before god comes by receiving the revealed word in no other way there's no other way it comes a a a a a mental ascent alone of a historical act at calvary by christ that alone does not save you you understand that's a that's a good start you do need to mentally accept that he was the son of god amen that he died to save sinners of which i am chief that that's where it starts you have to start there that's the that's the that's the front door to the gospel but i got a whole house i want to show you all right you so you're not you're not going to really have much shelter if you're just standing on the front porch staring at the front door all right so now yes it's a door yes it can be opened yes it leads you through but you gotta open it and go through all right so now look watch this so we're proving that it only comes by faith in the word all right matthew 13. and let's catch verses 10 through 15 and the disciples came and said unto him if you can get that up brother matthew 13 10-15 perfect and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whomsoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath verse 13 therefore i speak to them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the word fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is waxed gross and their eye their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time watch here's here it is here's what could save them lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them mark 4 here's what he says in mark 4 verse 12 that seeing they may see and not perceive right mark 4 12 that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sin should be forgiven them so how do i get my sins forgiven by hearing and receiving the word there is no other way and it's always been that way that's what it was for abel that's what it was for noah that's what it was for abraham the bible says the bible doesn't say abraham believed in god the devil believes in god the bible says abraham believed god what does that even mean god told him something and he believed it god gave him a word and revealed it to him and abraham believed it and god imputed righteousness to him not just that he believed in god but he believed what god told him and that's how his righteousness was imputed unto him amen john 5 24. giving josh a workout this morning i love it john 5 24 verily verily i say unto you now now i'm going to give you several things from john because john under that eagle anointing really caught some understanding of this verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but it's passed from death into life so who passes from death unto life who is doesn't come into the condemnation he that heareth my word and believeth all right now it's not here like brother branham said you hear a you see an alcoholic staggering down the road and you walk over to him and say and you saw him in church you know last sunday and you walk over him say do you hear what that preacher said and he would say yeah i heard it well that don't mean anything just he heard it with his ear but he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me this is the one that is is out of condemnation this is the one who's passed from death unto life now let's go on down to verse 36 through 47 john 5 36-47 but i have greater witness than that of john for the works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me and the father himself which hath sent me hath born witness of me ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent him you believe not search the scripture for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me so so we find that belief and acceptance of the word made flesh became the source of eternal life when the word jesus said you didn't believe me god sent me i am the word made flesh and because you don't believe that i'm the word made flesh then this is why you're going to die i am the word in a form you search the scripture you think you believe the word you went to bible school you think you believe the word but you don't receive it when it becomes alive in front of you yes amen see watch now verse 40 and ye will not come to me that you might have life i receive not honor for men but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you i am come in my father's name and you receive me not if another shall come in his own name him you will receive how can you believe which receive honor one of another and seek not the honor that cometh from god only do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuseth you even moses in whom you trust see for had you believed moses ye would have believed me for he wrote of me but if you believe not his writings how shall you believe my words now jesus this this is a two-way street jesus is qualifying their claim that they believe moses but he he's he's disproving that because they don't believe in him and he says well i'm only the manifestation of what he said so you can't claim to believe him and reject me you see what i'm saying so it doesn't matter you know when god reveals his word in every age down through all seven church ages that false church was constantly saying we're the church and they weren't and they were saying the real church wasn't and it was see but god had a messenger in every age to to to to save all of those who wanted to be saved everybody who would receive their word was in and whoever refused their word was out and that's what's happening here that's not a new thing this has always been the case since genesis i defy anyone to go anywhere in the bible and find any uh find even a single place where anyone any human man ever found acceptance before god by refusing his word it is impossible to find in the bible see now so so this now this is why so this is why john would come ah give me first john 1 and 7. this is why john who you just heard him with jesus sermon john's standing there writing down what he's saying you just read it this is why john could come in first john 1 7 and say but if we walk in the light as he's in the light we have fellowship one with another in the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin how do i get the blood of jesus how do i get cleansed from all sin by walking in the light see so but because the light was the life of men and the life was the light of men you follow me so so they go hand in hand all right now so so so john now back back to john 12 all right let's go to john 12. josh and i got just two or three more so john 12 all right verse 34 the people answered him we have heard out of the law that christ abideth forever and how sayest thou the son of man must be lifted up who is the son of man so i i'm gonna save some time go home and read john 12. because john 12 then is the basis that john in his epistles writes about he was the light of the world and in him was life amen this is how john could write because john heard the sermon in in the in the fifth chapter that of john and the 12th chapter of john and that's exactly why because what what you're going to find out what they're asking is who is this son of man that can forgive sins you keep talking about the son of man what is the son of man the word made flesh and with that comes forgiveness of sins that's why jesus said that that that judgment is granted to the son of man because he's the son of man so when god has revealed his word openly and plainly you only have one option and that's to say amen and allow that word to completely change your whole life and if you don't do that then all your faith in a historical event won't give you the new birth it won't i'm not saying you wouldn't be safe from destruction at the end because the unwise virgin don't get the new birth either they they reject the message and have to go on a tribulation i've preached on that three sermons prayer don't need to go over all that again we understand that of course the heathen will be raised up in the millennium to hear the gospel who never heard the gospel listen friends god's got this figured out if you just quit arguing against it and just realized god's got this he's got every question you could ever ask and ever wonder he's got a plan for it here's what you need to know i don't care what the circumstance looks like all his ways are right and all his words are true all his ways are just doesn't matter if it looks like injustice or inequality all of you don't know the whole story say well why what about this person well you don't know you don't know that person you know what's in their heart he does you don't know what happened in their secret time he does so so quit trying to figure out god's plan for him god god knows the everybody will get a fair trial anyway and he'll judge him by their heart it's not up to me all i can do is point you you know i suspect you're not here trying to figure out how to get eternal life after you go through the tribulation i suspect you're here to try to avoid a tribulation so i'm preaching to you how to do that amen i fair trial i don't want to trial fair or otherwise i want i want all my sins to go ahead of me so that by the time i get there it's already taken care of in christ jesus i don't have to answer for nothing oh hallelujah hallelujah thank god and and and what what does it take for me to get it faith in his word faith alone abraham believed god that was it that's all he could do that's all i can do i accept his word i accept his life it comes and it changes my whole heart there's nothing i can do to save myself all i can do is say amen to every word and that means i'm saying so be it unto me no matter what you say in your word lord so be it unto me i might stumble at it but i'll repent because i want it see so so then john you know so so so we find then that that john comes along and and and they're asking him you know who who is the son of man you know that that forgives sins all right let me get back to where i was all right let me get these last verses but go home and read that fifth chapter of john in that 12th chapter of john then go read first john and it'll all make sense to you all right so based on the things he heard he heard jesus teach in chapter 5 and chapter 12 thus he comes to first john and that whole epistle is based on what he heard jesus preach his eagle anointing oftentimes caught more than the other three guardians of the tabernacle so all right second thessalonians brother josh here looks like a few just a few more second thessalonians 2 13. but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth amen hebrews 4 12 hebrews 4 12. for the word of god is quick and powerful is the word of god quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so it goes to a level past the spirit down to the heart that's where the new birth comes in that's why the unwise virgin are saved from destruction because they they do have sanctified spirits the bible calls them saints read revelation 15. jesus called him righteous the king called him righteous in matthew 25. these are righteous people these are sanctified people these are not people with a form of godliness meaning they go to church and raise their hands and sing songs but they the women dress like prostitutes and the men cuss and smoke and and that's not a saint that's not a saint at all that that's a child that that's a that's a child of the world who who is continuing with their fallen nature can they be converted sure that's why jesus died but but but let's get them the real version of jesus amen so so he so he so we find that it goes past the spirit down to their heart james 1 18. james 1 18. i'll give you these two more james 1 18 of his own will beget he us with the word of truth amen how did you get the new birth the word of truth say it again how did you get the new birth the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures see in other words i become the continuation he was the beginning of a new creation i'm the continuation of that same creation see i'm in the first resurrection amen there's been a resurrection already christ came up see and there's gonna there's a there's a third exodus coming all right that was second exodus moses had the first exodus all right of his own will beget he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures in other words he gave me the new birth so i could be like him amen he doesn't give the new birth so you can stay you understand so he gives you the new birth so that you can be like him i mean i i listen friends if if you just think that through and be very sincere you can't make yourself into him amen that's that's one of the themes of my whole sermon today you can't make yourself into him he will remake you into him all you can do is be willing to stop being you that's all you can do all you can do is be willing to stop being you and let him make you into him see so all right first peter 1 first peter 1 brother josh get this last one verse 22 and 23 first peter 1 22 and 23 seeing ye have purified your what what louder souls seeing ye have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brother see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently brother kenny was talking about that very thing today being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever how are you born again in the soul by a love of the word amen there is no other option brother branham says here okay take that down read this quote and we're going to stop read you this this quote stand up with me and i'll read it to you brother kenny bring your team back now don't run out i want you to get this last quote all right listen to this blasphemous names brother branham would call it blasphemous names now brother branham is talking about the virtues that peter spoke of remember faith virtue knowledge patience temperance meekness amen so you have all of these virtues now watch what he says here patience and so forth all right there's a mockery of it you believe that there's a mockery of patience remember a form of godliness but denies the power denies brother i'm saying denies the living reality of it what what's what does what's the outcome of denying the living reality because it can never change my life all right patience and so forth there's a mockery of it a pretending to be a a a nature given faith a nature given virtue there's a nature given temperance all of these things are nature given and the biggest part of art now watch and the biggest part of our faith is mental faith all right by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of god but if this coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes this there is a godly spiritual faith then what does that faith do that faith recognizes only the word no matter what else anything else says it only recognizes the word because in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word is still god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and when the word itself is pouring into our faith our mental faith becomes spiritual revelation and upon this foundation i'll build my church not upon a mental conception of joining church joining a mental conception of that but upon the revelation when them streams of grace has poured into that mental faith that you've got then upon this a spiritual revelation i'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it see that shows they would be against it but it'll never prevail what a glorious thing now see the faith see it proves if jesus said the gates of hell shall not prevail against it brother man says well then that means the gates of hell are going to be against it so the gates of hell are against people getting spiritual revelation he doesn't mind them getting mental faith in a story but that and and there's value in that there's value in that don't ever think there's not telling the story of jesus just somebody reading the gospels there's value in that they're the unwise virgin inherit eternal life because of that but if you want to pass from death unto life now it's got to go on to you've got to follow on to know the bible says we shall know if we follow on to know have you ever thought about apollos apollos had already accepted that jesus was the messiah i was proving it mightily by the scriptures and but so how how do we know that apollo's faith was real because when he preached aquila and priscilla who had the baptism of the holiest and had a more perfect understanding took him home for lunch and sat down with him across a table and instructed him more perfectly and apollos accepted it and then is he done no then he's going through the upper coast of ephesus and runs into paul he don't have the holy ghost yet he's he's he's living a sanctified life he's proving christ out of the out of the scriptures he's not even he's not even born again yet and paul curious that's that's strange how are you baptized well we were baptized by john oh but no wonder that's why because well well why does that matter paul well because john came before calvary just to tell people that the messiah is here he he christ was a keystone between the old and the new but now he's already come he's died was buried rose ascended came back with his spirit into the church and paulus was like oh would i what do i need to do i'll have to re-baptize you no problem let's go right now what did he do he kept following he kept following and that following brought him to a new birth and that made him a contemporary of saint paul i mean what do you think would have been apollo's outcome had he just stan had he said to aquila and priscilla sorry i've got enough i've got all i need and when he went to paul and paul said you need to be re-baptized i don't need to do that paul i already believe in jesus i'm i can prove it better than you can i'm a better preacher than you d do you want you think apollos would have ended up in the heavens gospel hall of fame no no i can tell you what his christian the cr the history of the christian church would have had a lot different to say about apollos see he you shall know if you follow on to know oh praise the lord i i love what god has done for me in this hour now today friends listen i have proven to you out of the bible back and forth back and forth you cannot save yourself you can't save anybody you can't save you much less anybody else there's no works you can do stop chasing that stop trying to get to stop trying to find a satisfied feeling by working for the lord surrender if you're if you're if you're still chasing that you've got levels of surrender that you haven't reached yet because i can tell you something you surrender your way into the love of god at such a level in your heart you you you you'll do works works will follow but it but you won't you won't feel dependent upon those works you'll you'll work for the master because it'll just be second nature to you has nothing you don't you don't get his approval by chasing works you can't do that it means nothing to him there's you do good deeds sure laws are reaping and sowing yeah you give and it'll be given to you you you are merciful and you'll receive mercy and i mean the laws of reaping and sowing sure but i i'm not here just to just just to get his blessings i wanted him ruth wasn't just satisfied with the blessings of boaz she wanted boaz because she know if she got him in marriage she got all these blessings and all the field and all the servants that were dropping them she got everything amen so that's what we want friends and you can't do it by works we're saved by faith alone no other way faith in god's revealed word is the only path to redemption now to believe it differently you just have to accept dogma and creed of denominational thinking you need a different bible because this bible doesn't teach that that's what satan that's the lie he's told the world and it's up to us to tell them the truth and the best way as i preach three services the best way you can tell them the truth is live it let them see that you're claiming that this revelation won't just make you join a church and stop lying this revelation will affect every facet of your life you will move talk walk dress do appeal participate involvement your everything you do your whole motive and objective to life itself will be to be a servant of god and to shine forth his love to a world listen friends they're they're under a misunderstanding if we don't tell them about it who will see we're the only ones that that know what the misunderstanding is not because we were smarter or or smelled better but because that we believed the report when it came and god hath accepted our faith and changed our lives amen by your heads with me father i thank you and i feel so thrilled to know as i stand here today i don't have to chase anything i don't have to be any certain thing i just have to be willing to stop being me and let you make me into you there's nothing i can do lord there's nothing there's nothing i can achieve to earn it lord we've got to give the right message to the world that dressing a certain way or living a certain way or going to a certain church that if it's just the way if it's just works of man there's a value to sanctified living there's certainly a value and it will save people from destruction but if you want to be born again if you want to pass from death to life if you want to have your nature changed and be a new creation in christ the only way to do that is god's provided approach and that's faith in his word alone faith in his revealed word alone i thank you that you gave us back the full revealed word so that we can become the full image so that we can be the full continuation [Music] of your word for 2000 years it waned left and right and it looked kind of like it it wasn't exactly like it but you promised in the last days you would not bring something new you would restore the original and the originally the word the original word restored would restore the original life and that would restore the original church and that would restore original power that would restore an uh original thinking and a people who are willing to to obey willingly obey everything in your word thank you for it lord i stand here today with such confidence in your word i want to be a spiritual believer i don't want to just be fond of the fine qualities of jesus he had a lot of fine qualities to emulate but i want more than that lord i'm i'm happy for anyone who wants to do that but there's more more to be had maybe maybe with all heads bowed maybe you're here today and you've never known him at all and you'd like to it's easy it's not complicated you don't have to do anything but accept it accept your own death and receive his life and to say lord come into my life right now and come into my heart and change me completely make me into you i don't want to be me and if and if your faith is genuine and you really mean that he will accept it he promised he would and you will pass from death to life you'll become a new creation in christ jesus all your old life and desires will pass away and all your desires will become new that's how you'll know that you've passed from death into life because it will manifest itself in the way you live and breathe and go about your day and maybe maybe you're here today and you've already had an acceptance of the christ of calvary but you're unclear about the fullness of his word you're like apollos today maybe you just need to follow on a little more i'm here to tell you he's willing he's willing to take you on into the baptism of the holy ghost willing to take you on in the understanding of the word for this hour father i pray you'll do it today if there be anybody here lord and then lord maybe we should also include those who have already passed from death and to life i believe i have but i also believe i could climb a little higher and be a little closer i raise up my hands lord and say draw me nearer precious lord draw me more into thy image father cause my life to be more like you i pray you granted grant it all lord the visible audience and and and those who were streaming
