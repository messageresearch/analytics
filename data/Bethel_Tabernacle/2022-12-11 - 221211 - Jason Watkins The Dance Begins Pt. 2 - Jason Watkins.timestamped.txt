[37:01] special exhortation from our entire
[37:03] Ministry team amen I'm going to give
[37:05] them all about 10 minutes amen now
[37:07] brother Jason can't be here he's already
[37:10] crying over that so that means I get his
[37:12] 10 so I get 20. but the rest of them get
[37:15] stuck at 10. amen so we'll have some of
[37:18] the word and then we'll have the Lord's
[37:20] supper and foot washing and then of
[37:23] course the very next day is New Year's
[37:26] Day Sunday and what a better better way
[37:28] could you imagine a better way other
[37:30] than in glory to come to the house of
[37:33] the Lord then think about it friends
[37:35] think about the privilege while
[37:37] two-thirds of the country are hungover
[37:40] you get to wake up bright-eyed and
[37:43] bushy-tailed and clear-headed and a
[37:45] Heart full of love and go to the house
[37:47] of God and Worship the Lord and receive
[37:50] eternal life in the word

[37:57] watch Night Service we're going the
[37:59] service will operate under normal time
[38:01] parameters so we'll start at seven and
[38:03] run our usual normal schedule on that
[38:06] 31st I'll be aiming at it anyway just
[38:09] know that we're going to let the
[38:10] brothers have about 10 minutes each and
[38:12] then we're going to have the Lord's
[38:13] supper and foot washing and uh and then
[38:15] we'll dismiss whatever time that is we
[38:17] won't stretch it out and we won't try to
[38:20] cut it short but it's not a watch Night
[38:22] Service per se if you want to go to one
[38:25] of those I would imagine that those are
[38:27] still done in in some places and you
[38:30] could probably get out of here in time
[38:31] to go to another service and be in
[38:33] church till midnight amen I've done it
[38:35] and I'm not saying they're not nice I
[38:37] I've enjoyed myself Adam before but amen

[38:41] operating here I got a couple of prayer
[38:44] requests let me stand you back to your
[38:46] feet as we get ready to go into the word

[39:33] still not well I have all the compassion
[39:36] in the world for that battled it myself

[39:46] hinder today but it's all right amen
[39:49] he's he ain't nobody
[39:51] amen he don't run nothing but his mouth

[39:56] decisions of my life are made by my
[39:58] heavenly father and if the devil can
[40:00] even if he can even get something
[40:01] against me he's got to go get a pass
[40:04] amen so why should I worry why should I
[40:07] fear the very same Jesus standing right

[40:56] 9.
[40:58] now I am going to go back today at the
[41:02] direction of the Holy Spirit who
[41:05] completely hijacked me Saturday morning
[41:07] very early and you all know I've
[41:10] testified to that before thank the Lord
[41:12] I should say on my Human Side I thank
[41:15] the Lord that he does it but I thank him
[41:17] that he does it only a couple of times
[41:19] two or three times in a whole year
[41:21] and so uh he wasn't I guess he wasn't
[41:24] going to let me get out of 2022 without
[41:26] zinging me one more time and so uh
[41:29] material that I prepared weeks and have
[41:32] been working on and adding daily and
[41:34] adding daily
[41:36] um the Lord came and I'm still going to
[41:38] come to that amen
[41:40] um
[41:40] so uh you know Sarah a conversation we
[41:44] had that don't you worry that's that's
[41:46] coming but I actually believe that today
[41:48] will also amen amen speak to that so you

[41:55] me back the sermon I preached I believe
[41:58] on October 16th called that I titled the
[42:03] dance begins that was October 16 of this
[42:07] year I'm going back to make today part
[42:11] two the dance Begins part two if you

[42:23] we're just going to get two through four
[42:25] and let you be seated and we'll come
[42:27] back to the remaining verses
[42:29] first Thessalonians 5
[42:33] verse 2.
[42:34] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[42:38] day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in
[42:41] the night
[42:42] for when they shall say peace and safety
[42:45] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[42:49] as travail upon a woman with child and
[42:53] they shall not Escape
[42:56] but ye Brethren are not in darkness that
[43:00] that day should overtake you as a thief
[43:03] let's bow our heads father we thank you
[43:07] Lord for the reading of your word the
[43:09] assembling of the people the songs the
[43:12] congregational worship the special
[43:15] singing Lord as I said and listened and
[43:18] even even from the Sunday school teacher
[43:21] and his class Lord I said in my back
[43:24] office just amazed Lord at how you were
[43:27] confirming over and over the songs that
[43:30] were sung the special songs that were
[43:32] sung the very lyrics Lord were
[43:35] confirming confirming confirming that I
[43:38] know I have your perfect will this
[43:41] morning but Lord it'll be difficult for
[43:43] me because it's a little way that I
[43:46] rarely if ever maybe one other time in
[43:49] all my Ministry have ever tried to
[43:51] approach it in this way and so I'm
[43:54] needing your help as a mortal man Lord
[43:56] and I pray that you will also be with my
[44:00] heart you know sometimes what a baby I
[44:02] can be Lord but I get so caught up in
[44:05] your word and I just get so emotional
[44:08] and I thank you and so I'm asking for
[44:10] your Divine help today help me to just
[44:13] stay Lord on track and give me the words
[44:17] that you need now Master we have some
[44:19] sick people brother Mark and sister
[44:21] Tabitha Lord under the attack of the
[44:24] enemy Lord this poor young girl here
[44:27] through the family of our brother Caleb
[44:29] and not only that his wife and daughter
[44:31] and sickness plaguing them and the enemy
[44:34] plaguing the mind of this young girl we
[44:37] rebuke Satan and Lord in the name of
[44:40] Jesus Christ and we call for healing
[44:43] mind body and soul in all of these cases
[44:46] and all the other lingering effects the
[44:49] enemy has put on us today Lord be with
[44:52] my lungs and my throat as I am still
[44:54] with quite a call floor but but I'm I'm
[44:56] believing for for you to take control
[45:00] now in Jesus name we commit it to you
[45:03] amen God bless you as you're seated
[45:20] and I covet your prayers very sincerely
[45:23] today I I want to go studiously along I
[45:27] don't want to you know labor or you know
[45:31] too many points brother Jason Sunday
[45:33] school class today saved me a mountain
[45:36] of
[45:38] um of foundational stuff and it was I
[45:41] kept thinking because I I knew that that
[45:44] burden was on me and I said but Lord
[45:45] this is going to be impossible how in
[45:47] the world I don't want to rush over
[45:49] anything and I mean I I'm not a two-hour
[45:52] preacher and that's what it would take
[45:54] and you're gonna have to help me figure
[45:55] this out and lo and behold I'll walk in
[45:57] the door and brother JD's supposed to be
[45:59] on rest he wasn't even supposed to be up
[46:01] here and I walked in the door and hear
[46:03] him and I say my goodness brother
[46:04] Jason's got the Sunday school today and
[46:07] as I said in my office I just was
[46:10] speechless just speechless when he came
[46:13] out of the door I said Jay come in here
[46:14] through my closed door come in here and
[46:15] he heard me he walked in I said what in
[46:18] the world my it was just so amazing to
[46:22] me and so last time I want to just take
[46:26] a few moments and I want to bring just a
[46:28] half a dozen or so quick points from the
[46:31] first time I preached on the dance
[46:34] begins and I'm not really
[46:36] going back to try to rehearse it all
[46:39] like I say you can go to October 16 and
[46:42] get part one
[46:43] but in part one we took a uh some text
[46:48] out of the Book of Genesis we read a
[46:50] bunch of different places but I I I
[46:54] started zeroing in about how that God
[46:58] had made you know lights and and he had
[47:00] a greater light and a lesser light and
[47:03] one was to rule the day and one was to
[47:05] rule the night and we found out in the
[47:07] 18th verse of Genesis 1 that he used the
[47:12] light he he he that one was to rule over
[47:15] the day and over the night and here was
[47:19] the here's the second thing and to
[47:21] divide the light from the darkness and
[47:24] that was important to divide the light
[47:27] from the darkness and God's soul that it
[47:30] was good so you know the fact that God
[47:33] says to you you know as a Christian what
[47:36] Fellowship hath light with Darkness
[47:38] don't be out here rubbing shoulders with
[47:41] the world those shouldn't be your
[47:43] closest acquaintance you're you're
[47:45] you're your closest interaction
[47:47] shouldn't be with your career people
[47:49] it should be with the family of God
[47:51] don't don't think listen parents Mom and
[47:54] Dad please hear me when I say don't
[47:56] think that won't be unimpacting on your
[47:59] children
[48:00] but you you this is part of training a
[48:03] child the Bible doesn't say raise
[48:05] children it says that Women Marry bear
[48:09] children guide the home but the Bible
[48:12] says train up a child and as I've said
[48:15] to parents for years training is not
[48:18] easy and because it's difficult and it
[48:21] takes some work and it takes some
[48:23] selflessness
[48:26] you you can never train children
[48:29] correctly if you if you're selfish
[48:32] if you're only chasing your own uh
[48:35] motives and plans and dreams and your
[48:38] children are just a sidebar
[48:40] and all you're doing is feeding them and
[48:42] clothing them and housing them and
[48:43] keeping them safe
[48:45] see but it doesn't just say raise
[48:48] children it says train them up so
[48:52] because it's it takes work the the great
[48:55] cop-out is Parental delinquency and and
[48:59] so you you parents don't want to do it
[49:01] to which I say you will train them
[49:04] whether you want to or not your
[49:08] lifestyle that they observe will train
[49:11] them
[49:12] so you might as well do it right see
[49:15] amen and so the the world today is
[49:19] falling under the prophecy that the
[49:22] children would raise up at the end time
[49:24] to be tormentors
[49:27] of their parents of society
[49:31] there's a headline today where the
[49:34] sheriff of Brevard County in Florida
[49:36] actually had to get the attorney general
[49:39] and some other official important
[49:41] looking people he had to put on his
[49:43] uniform with his badge and his gun and
[49:45] his taser and and have a video shoot in
[49:49] front of a prison
[49:51] and was saying we're tired of the way
[49:55] you children and teenagers are acting in
[49:59] school
[50:00] that we've got teachers abandoning their
[50:03] career because they're dealing with
[50:05] violence and drug use and abuse from
[50:07] especially Junior High and high
[50:09] schoolers and he was simply putting it
[50:12] back on the parents to say you better
[50:15] get a hold of them before I do because
[50:17] if I get a hold of them
[50:22] it ain't going to end well and can you
[50:24] imagine that the the mind of parents it
[50:28] was so offended at that that they are
[50:31] holding rallies against that
[50:33] and liberal-minded parents are saying I
[50:36] don't like his tenor and I don't like
[50:38] his threat and I don't like that kind of
[50:40] language
[50:41] that the the absence of any kind of
[50:44] discipline is the whole reason
[50:48] that children have risen up in the last
[50:50] day to be tormentors of their families
[50:53] in their homes in their schools in their
[50:56] governments
[50:58] so you it's an important point it's an
[51:02] important point to train up children not
[51:06] only by teaching them the word of God
[51:08] because I can't do it all but by
[51:11] demonstrating the word of God which I
[51:13] can only do a couple of times a week or
[51:15] if I happen to see them in the middle of
[51:16] the week so it's all I can do is assist
[51:19] you Mom and Dad you understand I can't
[51:21] raise your kids I love them but I can't
[51:24] raise them
[51:25] yeah I can only be your assistant amen
[51:29] how many appreciate a good assistant
[51:31] thank you
[51:34] see I already spent more time on that
[51:36] than I should have
[51:37] so it was to divide the light from the
[51:40] darkness so don't be offended when the
[51:43] Bible tells you to shun the very
[51:45] appearance of evil don't get offended at
[51:47] that when it says you ought to live
[51:49] different you ought to look different
[51:51] dress different talk different act
[51:55] different go to different places do
[51:57] different things
[52:00] see
[52:01] and so the point to be made is that you
[52:05] know the main functions of light are to
[52:08] rule and to divide you get that so the
[52:12] light of the Gospel is the greatest
[52:14] light
[52:15] its function is to rule
[52:18] and to divide
[52:20] see so you say why why are you just
[52:24] drilling that so hard because Satan's
[52:27] aim that being true then then it
[52:31] shouldn't surprise you if I say then
[52:34] Satan's aim is to keep you in darkness
[52:40] for as long as he can any way he
[52:43] possibly can expose you to Darkness and
[52:45] get you to linger there he his goal then
[52:49] is to keep you from walking in the light
[52:54] not just believing in the light but
[52:58] walking in the light walking continually
[53:02] in the light see
[53:04] so this is this is what is so important
[53:07] evil spirits as we said in part one evil
[53:11] spirits roam in their greatest power and
[53:15] influence late at night that's a fact
[53:18] the prophet taught us that
[53:20] because they the darkness conceals them
[53:23] and that's that's their that's when they
[53:26] really when they can hide that's when
[53:28] they really can do their biggest damage
[53:30] all right so so so evil evil people lurk
[53:35] in the night and so this is why Paul
[53:37] would carry on brother Caleb in our in
[53:39] our opening text back to first
[53:40] Thessalonians
[53:43] um five and we'll pick up uh here at
[53:45] verse five
[53:47] ye are all the children of light and the
[53:52] children of the day we are not of the
[53:54] night nor of Darkness so so let me say
[53:58] to you come into the light as often as
[54:02] you can
[54:04] take every opportunity think of new ways
[54:08] to do it be inventive of new ways to
[54:12] capture your time and discipline your
[54:15] life to coming into the light say how
[54:18] can I do that coming to church is a good
[54:20] one
[54:21] for opening your Bible is a good one
[54:23] getting on your knees is a good one
[54:25] fellowshipping the Saints is a good one
[54:30] so we find that we have not been he says
[54:34] therefore let us not sleep as to others
[54:36] but let us watch him be sober for they
[54:38] that sleep sleep in the night and they
[54:40] that be drunken or drunken in the night
[54:41] let us whoever the day be sober putting
[54:44] on the breastplate of faith and love for
[54:46] a helmet the hope of salvation for God
[54:47] hath not appointed us to wrath but to
[54:50] obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus
[54:53] Christ
[54:54] so so light is associated with salvation
[54:57] you you'd believe that wouldn't you
[55:00] Darkness creates uh an opportunity for
[55:05] wrath Darkness creates a an appointment
[55:09] for Wrath
[55:10] sin pays wages did you know that and
[55:14] they're not wages you can decline
[55:16] sin actually pays wages and the wages it
[55:19] pays her death so light catch this now
[55:22] this is going to be important
[55:24] what I'm I'm about to say three things
[55:26] in a row they're extremely important for
[55:29] the for the last
[55:31] third maybe the last quarter of my
[55:34] sermon today because I'm going to tell
[55:36] you a story
[55:37] a true event that happened to me
[55:39] recently
[55:41] light is the place of Fellowship
[55:46] light is the place of cleansing
[55:50] light is the place of sinlessness
[55:55] you ought to thank God that he sent
[55:57] light into this age because now because
[56:01] he did that you who had no chance and no
[56:06] access to it you now have an opportunity
[56:09] catch it underscore you have an
[56:11] opportunity to have a place where you
[56:15] can have restored fellowship with God a
[56:18] place where you can be cleansed because
[56:20] you need it
[56:22] and you're going to watch you know
[56:23] what's going to happen to you tomorrow
[56:24] you're going to need it again
[56:26] and again you're going to need to stand
[56:29] but listen with the
[56:31] let me just say to you today that with
[56:34] the
[56:35] just the way the devil such a tidal wave
[56:39] of condemnation that he's constantly
[56:42] battling us with you're going to need a
[56:45] place where you can enter into and feel
[56:49] sinless
[56:51] Hallelujah and I'm here to tell you it
[56:54] exists and it's in the light and in the
[56:57] light when you can have Fellowship you
[57:00] can be cleansed and your cleansing
[57:01] creates the fellowship makes it possible
[57:03] and when you get into fellowship with
[57:06] God I'm here to tell you you feel
[57:09] sinless
[57:12] all right
[57:15] here's the fourth one light is the
[57:18] Gathering Place of God's children
[57:22] that's how you know it's God's children
[57:24] because of where they gather
[57:26] see and what what their life is made up
[57:29] of
[57:30] so in light friends in light is where
[57:34] Genesis is restored to you that's the
[57:39] place that because when we're here born
[57:41] in sin we're so far away from that
[57:45] Genesis creation where God had perfect
[57:48] unbroken fellowship with his family and
[57:53] Adam was an amateur god of the Earth
[57:55] that's a place where I want to be that's
[57:58] the millennium
[57:59] but I'm here to tell you something
[58:00] friends that kind of an atmosphere is is
[58:03] the door is now opened to you because of
[58:07] that day on Calvary the door is open to
[58:09] you to to come back into your Genesis
[58:12] condition again
[58:15] all right so
[58:17] we we're we're brother Brandon makes a
[58:20] couple of statements here in a message
[58:21] that moved me greatly yesterday I shared
[58:24] it with my Ministry team
[58:26] and brother I said my I've never heard
[58:29] brother Branham use this language I told
[58:31] my wife I said I've never heard this
[58:32] tapes he said that's impossible I said
[58:34] no I realize now I heard the one he
[58:36] preached this sermon twice and once at
[58:38] his Tabernacle I've heard that one but
[58:39] this is the Evangelistic one he went out
[58:42] and preached at Chautauqua and because I
[58:44] never heard him use this language and he
[58:47] says yes sir we pay so much attention to
[58:50] the Undertaker
[58:52] now it's kind of unavoidable
[58:54] amen we pay so much attention to the
[58:58] Undertaker I love this let's give some
[59:00] thoughts about the uptaker once in a
[59:02] while what
[59:05] the uptaker once in a while he said the
[59:07] one that'll take us up some of these
[59:09] days
[59:10] the only translation the only one who
[59:13] can bring us from the grave I love this
[59:15] the only one who can present us before
[59:18] the father without a fault without a
[59:22] spot without a wrinkle brother Branham
[59:25] says hallelujah I say hallelujah you
[59:27] ought to say hallelujah
[59:31] this uptaker can present me right now
[59:34] you mean right now before God
[59:39] without a fault without a spot
[59:42] does God really know me
[59:44] yeah he knows you better than you know
[59:46] you
[59:47] he can present you without fault without
[59:50] spot without a wrinkle
[59:54] see he starts telling the story of an
[59:57] old black man about 90 years old good
[59:59] friend of his brother Brandon grew up
[1:00:00] knowing him
[1:00:01] says he'd come walking down the street
[1:00:03] one day
[1:00:04] and he said now now here here I'm going
[1:00:07] to really start turning toward where
[1:00:09] brother Jason's Sunday school helped me
[1:00:12] so much today laid so much material I
[1:00:15] don't have to go into
[1:00:17] so he says uh he's he says he's about 90
[1:00:21] years old he'd come walking down the
[1:00:22] street one day and he yells over to
[1:00:24] brother Brandon he says I want to tell
[1:00:25] you something
[1:00:26] and I said all right what is it rep
[1:00:30] and he said well I'll tell you he said
[1:00:33] you take an old rooster
[1:00:35] you can tie his feet
[1:00:38] nail him into a box now how many have
[1:00:42] ever felt like that that's what the
[1:00:43] devil was doing to you
[1:00:45] man I want to worship God I want to have
[1:00:48] joy in my life I feel like my feet are
[1:00:51] tied down somebody's got me nailed into
[1:00:53] a box I can't move I need to be a
[1:00:56] Christian Lord where are you how many
[1:00:58] how many of us have been right there
[1:01:02] and he says he says you take it on
[1:01:03] rooster Ty's feet nail him in a box any
[1:01:06] way you want to said but when it starts
[1:01:08] to get daylight he'll turn over and Crow
[1:01:12] and brothers said I said that's right he
[1:01:14] said what makes him do that Billy
[1:01:17] and I said he's a rooster and it's
[1:01:20] breaking day Hallelujah that's right
[1:01:23] it's his nature and when a man is born
[1:01:27] of the spirit of God and has this
[1:01:30] eternal life anyone the Holy Ghost comes
[1:01:32] you've got to scream out something's got
[1:01:35] to happen
[1:01:36] and I didn't say I've had those times
[1:01:38] where my feet felt tied I felt like I
[1:01:41] was nailed in a box and couldn't move
[1:01:42] but one day the sun rises and I felt
[1:01:46] something inside me even still tied and
[1:01:48] I said hallelujah praise the Lord I'm
[1:01:51] still tired but praise God
[1:01:55] I don't need to be free of my trial to
[1:01:58] praise him
[1:01:59] I can Praise Him in the storm
[1:02:03] Hallelujah
[1:02:06] amen
[1:02:09] it's his nature
[1:02:14] so he says you yourselves know perfectly
[1:02:17] the day of the Lord cometh as a thief in
[1:02:20] the night
[1:02:21] for when they shall say peace and safety
[1:02:24] then cometh sudden destruction but you
[1:02:27] brethren
[1:02:28] are not in darkness
[1:02:30] not that day should overtake you as a
[1:02:33] thief
[1:02:35] there's way too many quotes to reap them
[1:02:38] all and I elected not to put a
[1:02:40] PowerPoint up
[1:02:42] so I've just got some highlighted places
[1:02:44] I want to refer to them and quote a few
[1:02:47] lines and
[1:02:48] you can go get the message
[1:02:51] uh June 6 1960.
[1:02:54] June 6.
[1:02:56] it's not the one he preached at his
[1:02:57] Tabernacle it's out when he went out
[1:03:01] now watch brother Branham comes to this
[1:03:04] and he's starting to make an argument
[1:03:07] and build a case
[1:03:09] for knowing the Lord Jesus
[1:03:12] personally
[1:03:14] now you see why brother JD's Sunday
[1:03:17] school was so vital
[1:03:19] to know him in a personal way
[1:03:24] he says the reason that we should go to
[1:03:26] Jesus
[1:03:27] to find this that no one else has but
[1:03:31] him
[1:03:33] and of course what does he have eternal
[1:03:36] life
[1:03:37] and he's the only one
[1:03:38] he's the only person and he's a person
[1:03:42] God is a person he's the only person
[1:03:45] that has and can give
[1:03:49] eternal life
[1:03:50] so I think it's almost an understatement
[1:03:53] to say you need to know him personally
[1:03:57] I don't think that can be oversold I
[1:04:00] don't think that can be over hyped I
[1:04:01] don't think I could wear that one out
[1:04:03] you need a personal
[1:04:06] relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:04:10] if you want to have
[1:04:13] eternal life
[1:04:15] he says where you see we're going out of
[1:04:18] this world he says we're sure of that
[1:04:20] see only those who are alive and remain
[1:04:23] are changed when the when the dead in
[1:04:25] Christ rise first and only the ones left
[1:04:28] alive are changed in a moment other than
[1:04:30] that every man no matter how good he
[1:04:32] ever was has an appointment with death
[1:04:33] see and so brother Branham says we're
[1:04:36] going out of this world we're sure of
[1:04:38] that and we don't want to go listen up
[1:04:40] teenagers listen up old people we don't
[1:04:43] want to go in the wrong direction
[1:04:45] the question is not will I go that's
[1:04:47] settled
[1:04:48] you will go
[1:04:50] the question becomes the problem is the
[1:04:53] rub is I gotta go but I don't want to go
[1:04:56] on the wrong direction
[1:04:58] there's and brother Brennan says there's
[1:05:00] we want to go to heaven when we leave
[1:05:02] this world every person wants to do that
[1:05:05] there's only one Heaven there's only one
[1:05:07] way to get to heaven and Jesus said I am
[1:05:10] that way that's the reason why that we
[1:05:14] must go to Jesus because he is the way
[1:05:20] now brother Branham is going to
[1:05:21] emphasize that over and over and over
[1:05:25] and over and over see he so now there
[1:05:29] are two ways that people try to say now
[1:05:32] watch this
[1:05:33] he's gonna just kind of testify to the
[1:05:35] people from his years of experience
[1:05:37] going around the world
[1:05:39] he finds that there are ways that people
[1:05:42] try to say
[1:05:43] if I live the Golden Rule
[1:05:46] uh or if I keep the Ten Commandments
[1:05:50] or some of his Catholic friends on
[1:05:53] certain days if I stop eating Meats
[1:05:55] sometimes people make those things a
[1:05:57] religion
[1:05:59] you know or he says or some religious
[1:06:02] Acts
[1:06:03] which is all right said if they want to
[1:06:06] believe that but still that isn't the
[1:06:09] way to heaven now he's going to say it
[1:06:11] again Jesus is the way
[1:06:15] all right I do not say that that you
[1:06:19] want to do those things won't go to
[1:06:22] heaven but you have to find Jesus first
[1:06:26] because he is the way thee and he
[1:06:30] repeats it the the only way
[1:06:35] now there's a way the Bible tells us and
[1:06:37] the prophet alludes to it there is a way
[1:06:39] that seemeth right to a man now that
[1:06:42] means that he becomes convinced that
[1:06:44] he's okay when he's not that's the whole
[1:06:47] point of that Old Testament passage it's
[1:06:49] people who are absolutely unwaveringly
[1:06:54] convinced they have faith that they're
[1:06:56] right
[1:06:58] when they're wrong
[1:07:00] and they think they have eternal life
[1:07:02] and they don't know they're going to
[1:07:04] hell
[1:07:05] now that's a Bible reality
[1:07:09] and so we need to solve that today
[1:07:12] amen so he says
[1:07:16] he goes on he says now
[1:07:18] Jesus is the way all right
[1:07:21] now there's a way that seemeth right to
[1:07:23] the man and he starts to tell a story a
[1:07:25] true story
[1:07:26] about how he says the pastor and I
[1:07:29] speaking of brother Neville he said we
[1:07:31] just spent some time with his
[1:07:34] sister-in-law
[1:07:35] trying our best to convince her that her
[1:07:39] religious Society couldn't save her
[1:07:42] but the woman was so so brainwashed that
[1:07:47] and she was inside this doesn't say what
[1:07:49] it was it wasn't a denomination or
[1:07:51] church or anything it was some kind of a
[1:07:53] society that was a religious society and
[1:07:57] he says you know we we were trying to
[1:07:59] get her to understand that that there's
[1:08:01] no life in that that that thinking that
[1:08:04] her Lodge was what was going to take her
[1:08:07] to Heaven because she belonged to a
[1:08:10] certain society and a lodge
[1:08:13] and they buried her thinking that
[1:08:16] she died unconvinced of needing to know
[1:08:19] Christ personally
[1:08:23] so he smothered about him as a preacher
[1:08:25] this is a pretty astonishing statement
[1:08:26] this got everybody's attention got my
[1:08:28] attention when he started saying it he
[1:08:30] says we're not here to condemn men for
[1:08:34] sinning
[1:08:37] I said we're not here to condemn sinners
[1:08:40] can you imagine a preacher saying that
[1:08:42] I'm in the Pulpit today but I didn't
[1:08:44] come here to condemn Sinners for sinning
[1:08:46] see
[1:08:48] we are here
[1:08:50] to condemn sin not the sinner
[1:08:55] man does not listen at this listen
[1:08:58] listen listen this is so profound
[1:09:02] man
[1:09:03] does not lose watch this uh
[1:09:07] man does not lose his life because he is
[1:09:10] a sinner
[1:09:12] he loses his life because he refuses to
[1:09:15] accept his life
[1:09:18] now it's obvious that it's not the life
[1:09:20] he got born with
[1:09:23] because he goes on to to Define what his
[1:09:25] life is and his life is in Christ Jesus
[1:09:29] the only one that has eternal life so
[1:09:32] the life you need is not the one you
[1:09:35] came here with
[1:09:37] good you with me the life you need is
[1:09:41] not the one you came here with that
[1:09:43] one's that one's doomed that one's born
[1:09:45] under a death sentence you can't clean
[1:09:47] it up enough it won't matter like
[1:09:50] brother Joe was preaching it's still all
[1:09:51] your works are still filthy rags
[1:09:55] see
[1:09:56] and so so we find that you you're not a
[1:10:00] sinner isn't destroyed because he was a
[1:10:03] sinner because brother Branham said God
[1:10:04] will never condemn a man for being a
[1:10:06] sinner never never no way because a man
[1:10:08] was born a sinner and God knows that
[1:10:10] he says one will condemn the man as he
[1:10:12] remained a sinner when he didn't have to
[1:10:15] that Jesus Christ by his by his death
[1:10:17] burial and Resurrection Ascension and
[1:10:19] descending back in the Holy Ghost made a
[1:10:22] way that you don't have to die so if you
[1:10:24] die and go to hell you've did it to
[1:10:26] yourself you're
[1:10:28] suffering a retroactive sentence you
[1:10:30] were born with and you never got rid of
[1:10:32] though you had an opportunity to
[1:10:36] see
[1:10:38] so he said this woman would not give up
[1:10:40] the idea that her Lodge was just as good
[1:10:43] as any church or anything else woman
[1:10:45] with cancer Pastor buried her day before
[1:10:47] yesterday say people would do that on
[1:10:49] their deathbed to do it all the time
[1:10:52] I've spent my life at the bad side of
[1:10:54] dying people
[1:10:55] knowing they're dying and go right on
[1:10:57] trusting in some human construct some
[1:11:00] religious system of Fallen man and you
[1:11:02] can't tell them otherwise I can testify
[1:11:05] to them other real realities of the
[1:11:07] Living God and the power of the
[1:11:08] resurrection and I got stories from from
[1:11:11] from 30 plus years of ministry on on six
[1:11:14] different continents I know he's real I
[1:11:17] know this word is true I know God keeps
[1:11:19] his promises and you tell them that and
[1:11:21] they just cannot divorce themselves from
[1:11:24] thinking and they're they're so
[1:11:26] entrenched in this human construct
[1:11:29] and they actually go to meet God in that
[1:11:31] condition
[1:11:32] he says now there is a way that people
[1:11:34] think they they just live a good life
[1:11:37] and can get to heaven but that's an
[1:11:39] error
[1:11:39] listen that's a prophet that's an error
[1:11:42] you do not get to heaven living a good
[1:11:44] life
[1:11:47] I'm not saying there's that's not
[1:11:48] blessed a good life is a better life to
[1:11:51] live
[1:11:52] sure regardless if I wasn't even if
[1:11:54] there wasn't a heaven I'd still live
[1:11:56] like I live because it's healthier
[1:11:58] I get to keep all my money I don't blow
[1:12:01] it I don't give it to the tobacco or the
[1:12:04] alcohol I don't wake up hungover
[1:12:06] I don't suffer any of the of the
[1:12:08] diseases and sickness that that kind of
[1:12:10] Lifestyle brings I have a nice home I
[1:12:13] I'm not divorced I raised up children
[1:12:15] they're honest men I I mean the way of
[1:12:17] the word is the way
[1:12:19] man
[1:12:21] it's a much better way than the way uh
[1:12:24] uh uh that's against the word of God
[1:12:26] you're crazy for living outside the
[1:12:29] dictates of a Christian lifestyle
[1:12:32] see
[1:12:33] and so but but the prophet is saying and
[1:12:36] and there's there's blessing in that but
[1:12:39] but as far as Eternal value now that's a
[1:12:42] different now you've gone to another
[1:12:43] level
[1:12:44] because now we're not just interested in
[1:12:46] just blessing here I want to know this
[1:12:49] life is so good and I love it so much I
[1:12:52] want to know how I cannot get it to end
[1:12:55] I would like to every man would like to
[1:12:58] live eternally and I have found a way to
[1:13:01] do that good news news flash I'm I'm a
[1:13:04] I'm a life insurance salesman life
[1:13:07] Assurance let me talk a policy with you
[1:13:10] friends Hallelujah
[1:13:14] so he says
[1:13:16] people think they can live a good life
[1:13:18] and go to heaven with that scenario God
[1:13:19] you do not get to have my living a good
[1:13:21] life The People Under The Mosaic law
[1:13:24] live The Good Life
[1:13:27] but Jesus preached to many of them in in
[1:13:30] hell
[1:13:32] then there here's another one he says
[1:13:34] then there's the way of the church
[1:13:36] the way we try to go to Heaven by the
[1:13:38] way of the church but in the church as
[1:13:41] good as it is it's still not the way the
[1:13:45] church can only point you to the way now
[1:13:49] he's going to say it again you ready but
[1:13:51] Jesus is the way
[1:13:55] and he'll keep repeating that more and
[1:13:57] more than any other thing in this sermon
[1:13:59] Jesus is the way
[1:14:01] some has perverted that way to change it
[1:14:04] into learning your catechism saying your
[1:14:06] Creeds or going by some Book of Rules
[1:14:10] amen
[1:14:11] he says and and and that may be ever so
[1:14:14] good
[1:14:16] but that's not the way
[1:14:19] the only way to go to heaven is through
[1:14:23] Jesus Christ
[1:14:26] he starts telling out of his experience
[1:14:28] he said I'm astonished today
[1:14:31] when I I walk up on people and I ask
[1:14:33] them are you a Christian and they say oh
[1:14:37] well I'm a Methodist
[1:14:39] and he said well that's that's not my
[1:14:41] question
[1:14:42] I ask you are you a Christian
[1:14:45] see and he said they say well I'm a
[1:14:47] Baptist
[1:14:48] I'm a presbyterian or even I'm a
[1:14:50] Pentecostal or a pilgrim Holiness or
[1:14:52] some church now there may be all right
[1:14:55] but that isn't the question
[1:14:58] remember now we got an exact kind of
[1:15:01] question
[1:15:02] that's not the question you never get
[1:15:05] the right answer having the wrong
[1:15:06] question
[1:15:08] see so so so the question you know so so
[1:15:12] so he says they may be all right but
[1:15:13] that's not the question the question is
[1:15:15] are you a Christian
[1:15:19] and you cannot be a Christian until you
[1:15:23] have received Christ
[1:15:26] in you
[1:15:30] now the world is filled with
[1:15:32] denominations of all kinds 30 we got
[1:15:35] north of 33 000 when I looked about
[1:15:38] three or four years ago I'd say what it
[1:15:40] is now
[1:15:41] 30 above 33 000 various denominational
[1:15:45] and independent Christian ideas of what
[1:15:48] it of what it takes to make Heaven your
[1:15:50] home I feel sorry for the sinner
[1:15:52] I want to tell you something friends at
[1:15:54] the center wouldn't have a chance and
[1:15:55] God couldn't condemn him on the last day
[1:15:57] if he didn't have me and you living out
[1:15:59] the word
[1:16:00] because everybody's got an opinion of
[1:16:02] this one book but when you've got a life
[1:16:04] that's living it and reproducing that
[1:16:06] life that you can read about here and
[1:16:08] the same signs and one and the same
[1:16:09] power is operating in you that you see
[1:16:11] operating in here then you can know
[1:16:13] you've found the way
[1:16:17] see each one of those movements
[1:16:20] certainly were useful to God down
[1:16:21] through history in their original form
[1:16:23] absolutely Baptist Pentecostal Methodist
[1:16:27] Presbyterian they were all useful to God
[1:16:29] down Through the Ages
[1:16:30] but they became but those names became
[1:16:33] Blasphemous names once the light moved
[1:16:36] on
[1:16:37] according to the Bible
[1:16:39] see the Bible said that this great
[1:16:42] with her Harlot daughters hadn't was
[1:16:44] found in the Book of Revelation with
[1:16:46] names of blasphemy
[1:16:48] see
[1:16:49] not words of blasphemy names of
[1:16:51] blasphemy see so those names become
[1:16:55] Blasphemous names once the light moves
[1:16:57] on to the next age and to stay in them
[1:16:59] then becomes a death trap because it
[1:17:02] becomes a false light
[1:17:04] you understand he says now not many
[1:17:07] people
[1:17:08] uh say that I will go to heaven
[1:17:11] he says now many people say
[1:17:14] I will go to heaven because my faith
[1:17:17] tells me so I belong to a church and my
[1:17:19] faith tells me I'm all right now I
[1:17:22] believe watch this I believe in the
[1:17:25] grace of God too but look now listen
[1:17:28] close because we're going to have to
[1:17:29] qualify this
[1:17:30] but look no matter what your faith is
[1:17:33] you're not going to be judged by your
[1:17:37] faith you're going to be judged by your
[1:17:40] works when you die
[1:17:44] that sounds counter-intuitive
[1:17:46] because it's through faith by grace
[1:17:48] through by faith through Grace that we
[1:17:51] are saved not of your Works lest any
[1:17:53] should boast and you remember Paul and
[1:17:55] James almost seem to disagree with each
[1:17:58] other and Paula said it has nothing to
[1:18:00] do with your works it's all faith and
[1:18:01] Grace and James says well show me your
[1:18:04] faith with without your works and I'll
[1:18:06] show you my faith by my works in other
[1:18:08] words there was already people in the
[1:18:11] early church claiming to be Christians
[1:18:14] who didn't have any works
[1:18:17] they were already just Christians in
[1:18:19] name only
[1:18:21] this is hundred centuries before nicaea
[1:18:24] this is during the time when the
[1:18:26] apostles are alive and preaching so
[1:18:30] don't be amazed if you have people
[1:18:32] sitting in message churches who have who
[1:18:35] believed the doctrine but have never
[1:18:37] been born again and do not have a life
[1:18:40] to back it up no signs and wonders and
[1:18:43] power and overcoming strength
[1:18:45] not even proper separation between light
[1:18:48] and darkness
[1:18:51] that's not new the early church had that
[1:18:55] see so now a bit of clarification is
[1:18:58] needed here all right
[1:19:00] clarification of course only made
[1:19:02] possible by the progressive revelation
[1:19:04] brought To Us by the same Prophet who
[1:19:06] just made this statement so I'm
[1:19:08] certainly not going to go outside of
[1:19:10] everything he said it becomes clear to
[1:19:12] us especially after the opening of the
[1:19:14] seals it becomes clear To Us by his
[1:19:16] teaching that that this scene he's
[1:19:18] speaking of is the great white Throne
[1:19:20] judgment you find it in Matthew 7 in
[1:19:23] Matthew 7 you find them coming to the
[1:19:26] Lord and saying you know
[1:19:29] I did not we do all of these wonderful
[1:19:32] Works in thy name and we cast out devils
[1:19:35] and did Mighty miracles in thy name
[1:19:37] and he'll say depart from me I never
[1:19:40] knew you
[1:19:41] now that's that's a part of the
[1:19:43] narrative
[1:19:44] of Revelation Chapter 20 The Great White
[1:19:47] Throne judgment another part of the
[1:19:49] narrative comes some chapters later when
[1:19:51] you get to chapter 25 and Jesus starts
[1:19:54] giving a little more of a picture where
[1:19:55] you've got two sets of of categories of
[1:19:59] humanity one he's going to separate and
[1:20:01] put on his right and one he's going to
[1:20:03] separate and put on his left
[1:20:04] and and you're going to find that that
[1:20:07] when all of this comes forward that
[1:20:10] there that that you have at this
[1:20:12] judgment bar you have people
[1:20:15] who come before the king
[1:20:19] and they they have a human faith in
[1:20:23] their works
[1:20:26] they said it in Matthew 7. did not we do
[1:20:29] all of these works in thy name they went
[1:20:33] to the Grave believing they were okay
[1:20:35] and that and chapter 25 shows they're
[1:20:39] not okay
[1:20:40] and they're going to be he said depart
[1:20:42] from me you workers of iniquity these
[1:20:44] are people who had a human face so
[1:20:46] brother Branham says you're not going to
[1:20:48] be judged on your faith you're going to
[1:20:49] be judged on your work he's talking
[1:20:50] about human faith
[1:20:52] see
[1:20:53] about your human belief
[1:20:56] all right
[1:20:57] but it was clearly human faith not a
[1:21:00] revealed Faith from God founded on God's
[1:21:04] word and when you read Matthew 25 it
[1:21:07] actually gives the appearance that life
[1:21:10] and death are determined based on Good
[1:21:12] Deeds or the lack thereof but it's not
[1:21:15] that because you can't earn eternal life
[1:21:18] based on human works we know that
[1:21:22] you know I mean I mean
[1:21:24] you know even even sincere
[1:21:27] good works with good motives and good
[1:21:31] objectives because you can't you can't
[1:21:34] force God to pay you
[1:21:37] eternal life because of your Works God
[1:21:39] will owe no man
[1:21:42] you understand you you can't hand him
[1:21:44] you don't get to stand there at the
[1:21:45] Judgment bar and hand him your time card
[1:21:48] of Good Deeds that you labored to do in
[1:21:50] the earth that this this is Judgment of
[1:21:53] their hearts and it's a judgment of
[1:21:56] their hearts response to the word
[1:22:00] see this is why the iniquitous crowd who
[1:22:03] had tons of Works don't get in
[1:22:05] because it was all iniquity
[1:22:07] their heart wasn't in the right place
[1:22:09] they had a human confidence
[1:22:12] that failed them and they're stunned
[1:22:14] they're astonished
[1:22:16] they're saying they even call him but
[1:22:17] Lord
[1:22:19] Lord I I remember doing all these things
[1:22:22] and he'll say I never knew you at all
[1:22:24] see
[1:22:26] in some cases and listen friends in some
[1:22:29] cases you know it might even you find
[1:22:32] that that summer getting into eternal
[1:22:34] life it because in some cases it was
[1:22:36] merely their heart's response to the
[1:22:39] word that they saw living in you
[1:22:44] what a privilege we have that somebody
[1:22:47] might gain eternal life because they
[1:22:50] they couldn't see the word you see it
[1:22:52] couldn't become quite clear to them but
[1:22:54] they they recognized it whatever you got
[1:22:57] that's what I want to be like
[1:23:00] that's what God told Cain if you'll just
[1:23:02] do as your brother
[1:23:05] see so we're not outside the scriptures
[1:23:09] so we find more than this that this of
[1:23:12] course is Humanity outside election
[1:23:13] that's for the bride she's not judged at
[1:23:15] all because Christ was judged four she
[1:23:18] accepted his pardon by accepting the
[1:23:21] word for her hour because that was
[1:23:22] Christ the bleeding word that was Christ
[1:23:25] The Living Word that's why it's bleeding
[1:23:27] it's got life in it it's Christ that's
[1:23:29] what has come in our day that's what
[1:23:30] that's what the early church had that's
[1:23:32] what they had in Jerusalem they had the
[1:23:34] living bleeding word they had Christ and
[1:23:37] it was lost down Through the Ages but
[1:23:38] God said I'll send a prophet and he'll
[1:23:40] turn that back he'll turn your hearts
[1:23:43] back
[1:23:44] to the original faith of the fathers
[1:23:50] so the elect lady is Seated on the
[1:23:52] throne
[1:23:53] having escaped this judgment completely
[1:23:55] so let me
[1:23:56] here's where I don't have to keep
[1:23:58] lingering on there because Brother Jay
[1:23:59] did such a good job this morning
[1:24:02] brother Branham goes on to say death
[1:24:03] does not change your spirit
[1:24:06] it only changes your Dwelling Place
[1:24:09] it only changes houses for you if you
[1:24:11] die in your sins you go to a worse
[1:24:12] habitation than what you're living in
[1:24:14] now
[1:24:15] but if you die in Christ you shall be
[1:24:17] with Christ and he says it again for he
[1:24:21] is the way
[1:24:25] people say
[1:24:27] I have faith that I'm saved and I don't
[1:24:30] doubt that they're completely convinced
[1:24:32] that they are they joined a church they
[1:24:35] got their name on a book
[1:24:37] I don't know they might have all kinds
[1:24:38] of religious activities
[1:24:40] and if they've if they've say well what
[1:24:43] if they've passed from Death unto life
[1:24:44] then they'll come to the light because
[1:24:46] Jesus said the Holy Ghost would bring
[1:24:47] you to the light
[1:24:49] it won't leave you in partial light a
[1:24:51] false Mirage a painted fire it'll bring
[1:24:54] you into the new day
[1:24:56] see
[1:24:58] people say I have faith that I'm saved
[1:25:01] but but that is only based on sometimes
[1:25:05] we have to be careful now
[1:25:07] because sometimes our confidence is
[1:25:09] based on our is based on our Doctrine
[1:25:13] and what if your doctrine's wrong
[1:25:18] see say well but we have the message of
[1:25:21] the hour well what if your understanding
[1:25:22] is wrong
[1:25:24] all right
[1:25:26] your understanding of the doctrine could
[1:25:28] be wrong uh you know I I and I would say
[1:25:31] to you today that you're hanging your
[1:25:33] soul which is the most valuable asset
[1:25:36] you have on Mighty Shaky Ground
[1:25:39] just to sit in a even a message church
[1:25:41] and say I believe God sent a prophet and
[1:25:44] I believe the message of the art and I
[1:25:45] believe all the teachings of the
[1:25:46] doctrine that's pretty Shaky Ground
[1:25:48] friends if you haven't moved on to know
[1:25:50] him after the power of his resurrection
[1:25:52] if you haven't entered into the
[1:25:54] fellowship of his sufferings if you're
[1:25:55] not being made conformable unto his
[1:25:57] death so that you might be a partaker of
[1:25:59] his life
[1:26:00] see
[1:26:02] see I know the message is correct
[1:26:04] teaching of the Bible
[1:26:05] but that's still not the proper question
[1:26:11] you might say but I believe it brother
[1:26:13] Jason Pastor Jason
[1:26:16] I believe it
[1:26:19] that's wonderful
[1:26:21] now now
[1:26:24] you can go in the right direction to get
[1:26:27] the proper question
[1:26:29] so I still don't have the proper
[1:26:31] question no
[1:26:32] the proper question is not
[1:26:35] am I in the right church or am I
[1:26:39] believing the right teaching
[1:26:41] but has the faith I claim to have
[1:26:45] changed my life
[1:26:49] that's the proper question
[1:26:53] not am I in the right Church
[1:26:55] or am I believing the right teaching but
[1:26:58] has the faith I claim to have changed my
[1:27:01] life has it taken all the desire of Sin
[1:27:05] from my heart and even imma tell you
[1:27:08] something say how do you know it's
[1:27:09] happened to you because even if I
[1:27:12] Stumble I find myself running as fast as
[1:27:15] I can back to God back to my knees
[1:27:18] asking for Mercy asking for forgiveness
[1:27:21] asking for renewal
[1:27:23] I don't want the world I can't stand
[1:27:26] ungodliness my flesh stumbles in it my
[1:27:29] mind thinks the wrong thing but I run
[1:27:31] quickly back
[1:27:33] Hallelujah
[1:27:35] asking for Mercy unabashedly asking
[1:27:39] forgiveness even if I ask for
[1:27:40] forgiveness of the same thing nine times
[1:27:42] last week I'll last nine times more this
[1:27:45] week
[1:27:46] continually again and again and again
[1:27:48] it's changed my life it's changed my
[1:27:51] desires
[1:27:55] this is a beautiful thing
[1:27:57] it has so many benefits
[1:28:00] and the kingdom
[1:28:06] don't don't don't go to it Caleb I'm
[1:28:08] moving too quickly but
[1:28:10] just make a note of it
[1:28:13] in Hebrews 4 16 the Bible teaches
[1:28:17] that those who are truly born again
[1:28:21] of the spirit of God
[1:28:23] that they should they should feel
[1:28:26] perfectly free to verse 16 come boldly
[1:28:31] into the throne of grace that we may
[1:28:33] obtain mercy and find Grace and to help
[1:28:37] in time of need how many have a need how
[1:28:39] many need help today
[1:28:41] oh this is a time of need that's the
[1:28:44] time of not only great need but great
[1:28:45] help
[1:28:46] Hallelujah there has never been listen
[1:28:49] friends there's never been a greater
[1:28:51] time
[1:28:52] or age
[1:28:54] in all the history of humanity
[1:28:58] that needs the grace of God like this
[1:29:01] age
[1:29:03] like this time
[1:29:07] from the time that men lived in caves
[1:29:09] and painted murals on the wall
[1:29:12] to stepping on the surface of the Moon
[1:29:15] and uh stepping from a space module onto
[1:29:19] the dust of the Moon and and now
[1:29:22] planning to step on Mars
[1:29:24] from the time of living in case painting
[1:29:27] murals and he's trying to step on Mars
[1:29:31] and there has he has never faced an age
[1:29:34] quite like this one is
[1:29:38] for the first time from the first time
[1:29:42] that the first heel of the first human
[1:29:44] foot
[1:29:45] walked on the earth there has never been
[1:29:48] a more perilous time than now
[1:29:54] in this age
[1:29:57] and in this time
[1:29:59] a man I want to taste something a man or
[1:30:02] a woman
[1:30:03] you need to know that you have access to
[1:30:08] someone who has the answers to life
[1:30:12] you need to have it in a reality form
[1:30:15] this is not an age to just be convinced
[1:30:18] of right teaching you need to know that
[1:30:21] you have access that you can walk in
[1:30:23] boldly to the great God and say master I
[1:30:27] have a need and I'll say what isn't my
[1:30:29] child here's my need you have it believe
[1:30:31] don't doubt it go you'll receive what
[1:30:33] you've said
[1:30:35] you've got to know where to find
[1:30:37] direction
[1:30:41] you've got to know that you can ask for
[1:30:44] and be granted an audience with the King
[1:30:49] up job 23 for me
[1:30:52] Caleb
[1:30:54] and we'll start at verse one but just
[1:30:56] before you put it up let me just make
[1:30:58] these comments
[1:31:02] job knew that when he got in trouble
[1:31:06] and job had some trouble
[1:31:10] and what was curious
[1:31:11] is job hadn't done anything to deserve
[1:31:14] it
[1:31:15] and God was using him for the grandest
[1:31:18] purpose
[1:31:19] that to date nearly any man it had to be
[1:31:23] in the top three maybe higher
[1:31:26] because
[1:31:27] God has a desire to put the knowledge of
[1:31:31] a redeemer in the earth so that man's is
[1:31:33] not shifting trying to find his own way
[1:31:35] around God's got to put knowledge in the
[1:31:38] earth that hey there's a redeemer you're
[1:31:40] not yeah and he calls job to suffer so
[1:31:43] that job could get down so low and he
[1:31:46] could just feel like he's no higher than
[1:31:48] the grass or the treaties or the nature
[1:31:50] itself he just wants to die he curses
[1:31:52] the day he was born he doesn't he has I
[1:31:55] hate it that the moon shined on a
[1:31:56] man-child and he's so distressed and
[1:31:59] I've done nothing wrong and what is all
[1:32:01] this about and and he gets down to say I
[1:32:04] see the grass and it dies but it gets to
[1:32:06] live I must be lower than the grass I
[1:32:09] see the flowers and the trees and they
[1:32:10] die but they come again but what about
[1:32:12] me what about a man if I die and I'm
[1:32:15] dying do I get to live again and that's
[1:32:18] when brother Branham said lightning
[1:32:19] trapped in Thunder Road and said God
[1:32:21] grabbed a Thunderhead stepped out on it
[1:32:23] and came whirling down get on your feet
[1:32:25] job I need to talk to you I'm bringing
[1:32:27] in a revelation into the Earth and he
[1:32:30] showed him a vision of that day on
[1:32:32] Resurrection morning when Christ comes
[1:32:35] out of the grave and he says I know my
[1:32:37] redeemer liveth and in that day I'll see
[1:32:40] him in these eyes and this flesh will
[1:32:42] Behold Him and brother Brandon said if
[1:32:44] job could have only known everything he
[1:32:46] went through and all the stuff he
[1:32:47] suffered and all the heartache was just
[1:32:49] so God could put that Revelation in the
[1:32:52] earth that if a man dies shall we live
[1:32:55] again yes he shall live again
[1:32:58] there's a redeemer
[1:33:01] there's an all-powerful King
[1:33:05] and that's all you might need this
[1:33:07] morning
[1:33:08] look at job 23.
[1:33:13] what you need
[1:33:16] is an audience with the King
[1:33:18] almost called the sermon then
[1:33:21] you need an audience with the King
[1:33:26] you might not need a new church
[1:33:28] you might not you might get a new church
[1:33:31] you might get a new friend
[1:33:34] you might get a new job
[1:33:36] you might get a whole new career
[1:33:39] but that won't do it
[1:33:42] I want to say to you today
[1:33:44] get to the king
[1:33:46] get to the king
[1:33:48] don't worry about a new friend or a new
[1:33:50] career or a new job get to the king make
[1:33:53] sure no matter what is in your life you
[1:33:55] got school ahead of you you young men
[1:33:56] and young women you got school ahead of
[1:33:58] you let me tell you you're going to need
[1:33:59] the king you're going to need to have an
[1:34:01] access you're going to need a portal
[1:34:03] you're going to need to be able to walk
[1:34:04] through a portal and walk into the
[1:34:06] presence of somebody greater than you
[1:34:09] this is Job's eighth declaration it's a
[1:34:11] response to eliphaz then job spoke again
[1:34:14] my complaint today is
[1:34:16] I'm sorry uh let's read it from there
[1:34:18] even even today is my complaint bitter
[1:34:21] my stroke is heavier uh than my heavier
[1:34:25] than my groaning
[1:34:27] all that I knew where I might find him
[1:34:30] that I might come even to his seat
[1:34:33] I would order my cause before him and
[1:34:36] fill my mouth with arguments
[1:34:38] I would know the words which he would
[1:34:41] answer me and understand what he would
[1:34:43] say unto me
[1:34:46] will he plead against me with his great
[1:34:48] power no see job's Faith No but he would
[1:34:54] put strength in me this is somebody in
[1:34:57] spite of every trial knew the God he
[1:34:59] served he'll put strength in me he says
[1:35:03] there the righteous might dispute with
[1:35:05] him so should I be delivered from ever
[1:35:08] forever from my judge behold I go
[1:35:12] forward he is not there now here's his
[1:35:14] problem here's the problem he knew what
[1:35:17] to do he knew where he needed to get to
[1:35:19] but how do I find him
[1:35:21] see this is on the blood of bulls and
[1:35:23] goats he's got no access that Fellowship
[1:35:25] in Genesis is lost you get me
[1:35:28] behold I go forward he's not there
[1:35:31] backward but I cannot perceive him
[1:35:33] on the left hand where do where he does
[1:35:36] work but I cannot Behold Him He hideth
[1:35:38] himself on the right hand that I cannot
[1:35:40] see him
[1:35:41] but he knoweth the way that I take
[1:35:44] when he hath tried me I shall come forth
[1:35:48] as gold
[1:35:49] my foot hath held his steps his way have
[1:35:55] I kept listen friends when you in the
[1:35:59] midst of whatever trial the devil can
[1:36:01] put you through in the midst of this
[1:36:02] perilous time in the midst of this crazy
[1:36:05] world
[1:36:06] whatever you might face you need to be
[1:36:08] able to say this my foot hath held his
[1:36:10] steps his way have I kept and not
[1:36:13] declined verse 12 finally neither have I
[1:36:16] gone back from the Commandment of his
[1:36:18] lips I have esteemed the words of his
[1:36:22] mouth more than my necessary food
[1:36:28] I'm going to read that quickly through
[1:36:29] the NLT listen now
[1:36:32] then job spake again my complaint today
[1:36:34] is still a bitter one this is his eighth
[1:36:36] declaration
[1:36:37] my complaint today is still a bitter one
[1:36:40] as is before his Revelation and I try
[1:36:42] hard not to groan aloud
[1:36:44] if only I knew where to find God I would
[1:36:47] go to his court
[1:36:49] I would lay out my case as a courtroom
[1:36:52] it's a judgment seat remember remember
[1:36:54] when Jesus was on trial and the Bible
[1:36:56] says pilate entered the judgment
[1:36:59] seat again so this is this is a place
[1:37:01] where an authoritative figure enters
[1:37:04] into for judgment see all right so you
[1:37:06] get that
[1:37:07] so he says if only I knew where to find
[1:37:10] God I would go to his court I would lay
[1:37:13] out my case and present my arguments
[1:37:15] then I would listen to his reply and
[1:37:17] understand what he says to me would he
[1:37:20] use his great power to argue with me no
[1:37:22] he would give me a fair hearing honest
[1:37:25] people can reason with him so I would be
[1:37:27] forever acquitted by my judge I go east
[1:37:30] but he's not there I go west but I
[1:37:32] cannot find him I I do not see him in
[1:37:34] the North or he's hidden I look to the
[1:37:36] South but he's concealed but he knows
[1:37:39] where I am going and when he tests me I
[1:37:42] will come out as pure as gold for I have
[1:37:45] stayed on God's paths I have followed
[1:37:47] his ways and not turned aside I have not
[1:37:50] departed from his commands but have
[1:37:52] treasured his words more than daily food
[1:38:00] still with me
[1:38:04] David knew there was a clef in the rock
[1:38:07] David knew there was a secret Dwelling
[1:38:10] Place
[1:38:12] of his Pavilion
[1:38:14] brother random saw it as a little room
[1:38:17] and he says I will meet you in there
[1:38:20] little wooden room would represents
[1:38:23] Humanity
[1:38:24] I'll meet you I'll meet you in there
[1:38:27] that's not a metaphor
[1:38:29] that's for real
[1:38:30] and brother Adam says why
[1:38:33] why in there it's always been on the
[1:38:35] pulpit it's been open to the world it's
[1:38:37] been an attraction I'll meet you in
[1:38:39] there well why because this will be a
[1:38:41] secret
[1:38:43] the world won't know about this place
[1:38:45] this is a place where only my bride will
[1:38:48] have access to I want her to know that
[1:38:50] she can come to see me I want her to
[1:38:52] know that that day on Calvary and the
[1:38:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost makes this
[1:38:57] possible that she can walk boldly into
[1:39:00] this Pavilion let me tell you something
[1:39:01] friends where in 2022 stop waiting on
[1:39:05] some kind of Supernatural thing down the
[1:39:07] road oh he's gonna he's gonna have a
[1:39:09] tent we're going to have a room and
[1:39:10] we're going to do something nobody even
[1:39:12] knows what we're going to do I'm here to
[1:39:13] tell you I'm living there now now I went
[1:39:16] and visited it even recently I know it's
[1:39:18] there
[1:39:21] there is a refuge for the family of God
[1:39:23] a covert from Storm as the Bible says
[1:39:26] don't presume upon God now listen listen
[1:39:28] don't presume upon God here here's a
[1:39:31] real theme of what we're bringing to you
[1:39:33] today you can't presume don't presume
[1:39:36] that you're okay with your human faith
[1:39:39] it has to be a revealed Supernatural
[1:39:42] Faith because that's the grace
[1:39:45] that's the grace don't turn Grace into
[1:39:48] disgrace that's what the world
[1:39:49] Christianity world does today they turn
[1:39:51] Grace into disgrace oh I love the grace
[1:39:53] of God I can live any way I want that's
[1:39:55] not Grace Grace is a revealed Faith
[1:39:58] Hallelujah that's the grace of God you
[1:40:00] know it's Grace when it teaches you to
[1:40:04] deny ungodliness
[1:40:06] because that's what Grace does
[1:40:10] that has to be your whole heart seeking
[1:40:12] a relationship I've heard people quite
[1:40:14] Cavalier when it comes to this
[1:40:16] quite Cavalier when it comes to
[1:40:18] repenting to God for their sin
[1:40:22] brother Branham says in the sermon he
[1:40:23] cares do you care
[1:40:25] it's short I'm going to read it in its
[1:40:27] entirety
[1:40:28] he's talking about
[1:40:30] repentance without any sincerity at all
[1:40:34] just sloppy
[1:40:37] insulting to God
[1:40:40] he says what if I say now
[1:40:43] I'm going to confess it
[1:40:45] that I done wrong and brother Brandon's
[1:40:47] saying now I really did do wrong
[1:40:49] and he said I'm going to go confess it
[1:40:51] that I done wrong and I say good Lord
[1:40:55] oh friend of mine
[1:40:57] you know that I know you're real well
[1:40:59] praise God hallelujah
[1:41:02] think you're a good old fella forgive me
[1:41:04] you old friend old friend I didn't mean
[1:41:06] it that way see
[1:41:08] now you say that's sacrilegious brother
[1:41:10] Brown says it is
[1:41:12] to make a confession like that
[1:41:15] but what if I go to the Lord and say
[1:41:18] I didn't mean to do it just that way you
[1:41:21] help me and I won't do it again you know
[1:41:23] what he said he'll do when you repent
[1:41:25] the way he just named he said he'll
[1:41:28] refuse your sacrifice
[1:41:31] you're trying to go to him and say I
[1:41:33] didn't mean to do it that's what you
[1:41:35] need to be saying but instead it comes
[1:41:37] out hey a buddy old Powell Chum hey
[1:41:40] Jesus how about it come on man wink wink
[1:41:43] you know he goes into a an example of if
[1:41:47] he was unfaithful to his wife and say
[1:41:48] hey old girl how about it you know
[1:41:50] mother of my children how about what do
[1:41:52] you say forgive me I didn't mean how
[1:41:53] about it says how about you how about
[1:41:54] you forgive me he said my wife would
[1:41:56] look at me like what has happened to my
[1:41:57] husband
[1:42:04] I heard it I've heard it said to my face
[1:42:06] to my face as a minister I I had one
[1:42:09] young man say to me I started talking to
[1:42:11] him about his soul and about his
[1:42:12] lifestyle he'd been raised in the
[1:42:14] message and taught better and he says oh
[1:42:16] he's wiped me off and just gave me the
[1:42:17] hand
[1:42:18] I I'll just quickly say Jesus forgive me
[1:42:21] my sin and I'll be okay don't presume
[1:42:23] you'll be okay
[1:42:24] you won't be okay Paul reminded that his
[1:42:27] own Christian Countryman in Rome in the
[1:42:30] ninth chapter he says he saith to Moses
[1:42:33] I will have mercy on whom I will have
[1:42:35] mercy and I will have compassion on whom
[1:42:38] I will have compassion there has to be
[1:42:40] something more than a hope so more than
[1:42:42] a mental workup friends it's got to be
[1:42:45] more than Sensations or emotions
[1:42:49] some enthusiasm listen listen can I just
[1:42:52] say this I I employ emotion and
[1:42:56] enthusiasm I do that deftly I do that
[1:42:59] craftily I do that I practice that
[1:43:03] you know you know why I have to do that
[1:43:06] you know why I have to employ emotion
[1:43:08] and enthusiasm a lot of times
[1:43:11] unfortunately that ain't going to save
[1:43:12] you but what it will do is it'll break
[1:43:15] open your crusty mind
[1:43:17] that you spent so much time for the
[1:43:19] nonsense of the world and your mind
[1:43:21] comes in here so poisoned
[1:43:22] and I have to use all kinds of human uh
[1:43:25] Ingenuity you know to to break through
[1:43:28] your crusty mind open the door of your
[1:43:30] heart with its rusty hinges
[1:43:32] because you don't never open it to the
[1:43:34] Lord very often
[1:43:38] I use it for teenagers because the
[1:43:40] social fabric of the world tells them it
[1:43:42] ain't cool to worship God
[1:43:44] and then others because I I know they
[1:43:47] rarely if ever see it in their family
[1:43:49] life at home
[1:43:52] there's nothing wrong with emotion as a
[1:43:55] tool I'll use it whatever works as long
[1:43:57] as I can find it in the word of God and
[1:43:59] there's plenty of emotion and sensation
[1:44:01] and enthusiasm and Zeal in the word of
[1:44:04] God David danced with all his might and
[1:44:07] then in the name went out the next day
[1:44:08] just to spite his wife and did it on
[1:44:10] purpose even more
[1:44:14] but I want to tell you something friends
[1:44:17] if you're going to find yourself
[1:44:18] entering boldly into the presence of the
[1:44:21] king it'll take more than emotion
[1:44:25] it'll take a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:44:29] to you personally a knowing
[1:44:33] from the depths of your soul that you've
[1:44:35] passed from Death to life and may I add
[1:44:39] and I add this by experience a knowledge
[1:44:42] that I was in him before the foundation
[1:44:45] of the world
[1:44:46] that's what that Revelation has given to
[1:44:49] my heart that's how I can walk even even
[1:44:51] in the face of personal failure I can go
[1:44:54] to my knees and walk boldly and it ain't
[1:44:57] Jesus hey old buddy old pal it's Master
[1:44:59] it's Lord God my father I'm your son and
[1:45:04] I I I remind me and I remind him I'm
[1:45:07] your son and I need cleansing I know
[1:45:09] you've heard me say it and you're going
[1:45:11] to hear me say it again I need you now
[1:45:13] more than ever before
[1:45:16] oh my it's gonna when I need to talk to
[1:45:19] him when I have troubles in my life when
[1:45:21] my when my burdens are heavy and I need
[1:45:24] an audience with the king oh Hallelujah
[1:45:27] when I need to talk it over with him and
[1:45:30] plead my case when I need to plead your
[1:45:32] case and my case together
[1:45:35] oh I enter his court
[1:45:37] I enter his court with a revealed faith
[1:45:41] but I have passed from Death to life I
[1:45:46] enter his court with a certain knowledge
[1:45:49] that I have been Justified
[1:45:51] all the way back to my Virgin condition
[1:45:56] just as if I had never been born in sin
[1:46:01] just as if I had never committed a
[1:46:04] transgression in all 59 years of my life
[1:46:09] that's why I can enter boldly
[1:46:13] into his Gates
[1:46:17] you find examples of God intervening I
[1:46:19] know I'm I'm at the outer limits of my
[1:46:22] normal
[1:46:23] but I'm not done
[1:46:25] can I want to get to my testimony can I
[1:46:27] get to the I need 10 more minutes of
[1:46:29] preaching I want to give you a testimony
[1:46:30] are you good
[1:46:33] you find it all through the Bible and
[1:46:34] I'm going to try to skip some of this if
[1:46:36] I can
[1:46:38] you find where
[1:46:41] life is like we read in the Bible you've
[1:46:44] got to read the book of Nehemiah and he
[1:46:46] wept for Jerusalem he wept to have a
[1:46:48] temporary wept for Jehovah he wept at
[1:46:51] Sea worship restored
[1:46:53] and we find him
[1:46:55] that when they go to build and try
[1:46:58] they're trying to do a good thing you
[1:46:59] got all of these naysayers
[1:47:02] oh it was in his ears every day you ever
[1:47:05] have that friends you ever like Nehemiah
[1:47:08] you're trying to build a wall you're
[1:47:09] trying to restore worship and you got
[1:47:11] the devil over here yak yak yak yak you
[1:47:14] this you that you this you that
[1:47:16] and the only thing he ever seems to do
[1:47:18] is discourage you devil don't have one
[1:47:20] encouraging word for you I don't know
[1:47:21] why you listen to him
[1:47:24] it's all about sins that you committed
[1:47:26] that Jesus don't even know anything
[1:47:28] about anymore
[1:47:29] see they're not in the sea of uh they're
[1:47:32] not in the sea of his deep remembrance
[1:47:34] theologians actually believe the Sea of
[1:47:36] God's forgetfulness is a is a sea that
[1:47:38] things are your sins are buried so deep
[1:47:40] he just chooses not to remember them
[1:47:41] anymore I'm so thankful for a prophet
[1:47:45] who said no sir that sin gets
[1:47:48] annihilated it gets turned back and goes
[1:47:50] back on the head of the devil who made
[1:47:52] you do it and you stand justified in the
[1:47:55] presence of God as though you never
[1:47:57] sinned in the first place you're not
[1:47:59] forgiven you're Justified
[1:48:03] you find stories in in ezron and nehem
[1:48:08] and Esther and you know the the
[1:48:10] beautiful thing is one night in the Book
[1:48:12] of Esther
[1:48:13] God had a God had a family member who
[1:48:16] had done a lot of good stuff and a lot
[1:48:17] of good stuff for the king save the
[1:48:18] King's life actually Esther's uncle
[1:48:22] and uh the king is up one night he can't
[1:48:24] sleep God drove sleep from him calls for
[1:48:27] the chronicler hey come come bring me
[1:48:29] the record and bring me the record bring
[1:48:31] me the Chronicles uh how far back I
[1:48:33] don't know last year just read me the
[1:48:36] Chronicles I want to make sure I'm up on
[1:48:37] everything and they're reading well this
[1:48:38] one did this and listened to them what
[1:48:40] do we do for him well we gave him a
[1:48:41] royal Medallion and this one did this
[1:48:43] and what'd you do what do we do for him
[1:48:44] well we gave him improvements to his
[1:48:46] house and gave him some social security
[1:48:48] and and and he gets to Mordecai and says
[1:48:51] who says Mordecai
[1:48:53] that's a weird name yeah he's a Jew he's
[1:48:56] a he's a he's a captive brought over by
[1:48:58] your predecessors oh really what did he
[1:49:01] do well he saved your life really yeah
[1:49:04] they were going to kill you
[1:49:04] assassination he found out about it and
[1:49:06] tipped off your captain of your garden
[1:49:08] and you saved your life it's what did we
[1:49:09] ever do for him he said oh nothing
[1:49:13] so oh my goodness and he literally calls
[1:49:18] in his enemy who hates him
[1:49:20] and says what should we do for the man
[1:49:23] who's done the greatest deed to the king
[1:49:24] and that imagine when this guy thinks
[1:49:26] it's all him well you should have a
[1:49:28] parade and you should put a medallion
[1:49:30] around him you should put him in your
[1:49:31] cherry and blow a trumpet and and he
[1:49:33] says that's an excellent idea go get
[1:49:35] Mordecai the Jew and do exactly like
[1:49:37] you've just said
[1:49:40] so God has a book of remembrance
[1:49:43] Kings have a book of remembrance
[1:49:47] you understand you go you go to Ezra and
[1:49:49] Ezra gets a gets a decree from from the
[1:49:54] king from Cyrus go back and rebuild the
[1:49:57] Temple and they go back to do it and
[1:49:59] then I hear you here you come all those
[1:50:00] naysayers again all the people who are
[1:50:02] trying to forget it don't do it you're
[1:50:03] terrible we hate you and and and they
[1:50:06] and then another king comes to the
[1:50:08] throne and Cyrus is gone and and another
[1:50:11] king comes and so these people take
[1:50:12] advantage of the politics at the time
[1:50:14] and they write a letter to the new king
[1:50:16] say listen these people are are
[1:50:18] murderous and rebellious and they they
[1:50:20] their their insurrectionist and you
[1:50:22] better not let them re-establish
[1:50:23] themselves here and the King reads that
[1:50:25] like oh my goodness he writes a Royal
[1:50:27] Decree send this by the fastest writer
[1:50:30] quickly this is a cease and desist stop
[1:50:32] all building stop everything right now
[1:50:35] and Azeroth says okay
[1:50:37] well we happen to have an old record
[1:50:41] from a previous King
[1:50:43] that said we could go do this
[1:50:45] and in fact it gave us money out of the
[1:50:47] royal Treasury and said that anybody who
[1:50:50] gets in our way he'd put him on a pole
[1:50:55] he would impale them on a pole and kill
[1:50:57] all their family and burn their houses
[1:50:58] down if they even got in our way and in
[1:51:01] fact is he told he gave us a letter that
[1:51:02] when we got to the back into into
[1:51:04] Palestine that the governor right there
[1:51:07] has to give us more money out of the out
[1:51:08] of that treasury to help us
[1:51:10] and so they just took up their letter
[1:51:12] handed it back to the messenger said go
[1:51:14] show this to the king
[1:51:15] and they take it back and they come into
[1:51:17] the next king and he reads he looks at
[1:51:19] this letter and he goes goodness
[1:51:22] send to the send to the to the
[1:51:24] Chronicles send to the library quickly
[1:51:26] oh my goodness this is treason I might
[1:51:29] have to kill myself go quickly the laws
[1:51:33] of the mees and Persians can't be broken
[1:51:35] not even by a king
[1:51:37] and they hurry they quickly run and they
[1:51:39] I love these Old Testament stories look
[1:51:41] at all these young kids just like look
[1:51:42] at me look what happened
[1:51:45] you see I use emotion on purpose
[1:51:48] Hallelujah like running under digging
[1:51:51] digging digging Cyrus okay right here it
[1:51:54] is oh no they run back they headed to
[1:51:57] the king and he reads the words of Cyrus
[1:51:59] now he's committed treason against the
[1:52:01] performer King he immediately rips up
[1:52:03] his old decree writes the new and puts a
[1:52:05] stamp on and says go quickly back
[1:52:07] whatever you do don't stop don't go left
[1:52:10] don't pass go don't collect 200 go go
[1:52:13] all the way back to Palestine and tell
[1:52:15] them now do not harm these Jews if you
[1:52:18] get in their way I'll kill you your dog
[1:52:20] your family your cows I'll burn your
[1:52:22] house down I'll poison your fields stay
[1:52:24] away from them and give them all the
[1:52:25] money in your pocket
[1:52:33] God has a place
[1:52:36] God's courts are real
[1:52:40] God keeps his word
[1:52:44] you know the problem that we have is we
[1:52:47] live in this Fallen body
[1:52:49] and Fallen man has
[1:52:52] tried for years to
[1:52:55] figure out a way to bring him under heel
[1:52:58] outside of a new birth and the new birth
[1:53:01] is just easy just get a nature change
[1:53:02] and then you'll you'll you'll naturally
[1:53:05] want to do this
[1:53:06] you won't have to try to do you just
[1:53:07] naturally want to do it your whole
[1:53:09] desires will change you might still
[1:53:10] stumble and fail but the beauty of it is
[1:53:12] it won't count
[1:53:15] won't count
[1:53:16] see
[1:53:17] and and and they they they have all
[1:53:20] these gurus and I was I've seen a
[1:53:23] documentary the other day and there's
[1:53:24] some Guru in Australian there's a guru
[1:53:27] in Tibet and there's there's one out
[1:53:29] west and a Native American and they got
[1:53:31] tents out there and they'll sweat you
[1:53:33] out and give you peyote so you have
[1:53:35] visions and and they'll they'll make you
[1:53:37] live in the jungle for three months and
[1:53:39] walk around half naked and don't get in
[1:53:41] the shower and and they're trying to
[1:53:43] purge the old man out of you well
[1:53:46] sometimes they have fantastic success
[1:53:49] because mental disciplines emotional
[1:53:51] disciplines work but here's the problem
[1:53:52] here's the rub that man you took to
[1:53:54] Australia or to to bed or to to the West
[1:53:57] he'll just come home with you
[1:53:59] he'll just come home with you
[1:54:01] and it'll only be a matter of time
[1:54:03] before he re-emerges because you just
[1:54:04] can't keep that up
[1:54:06] eventually after a while and even and
[1:54:09] here's the real thing even if you go to
[1:54:12] your grave firmly disciplined in your
[1:54:14] lifestyle you'll still die and Miss
[1:54:17] heaven
[1:54:19] see I offer you today
[1:54:24] a complete death of that haunting man
[1:54:27] I offer you today young people a
[1:54:30] complete death to that haunting man the
[1:54:32] spirit of the true God will annihilate
[1:54:35] him and take up his Abode in your heart
[1:54:38] forever
[1:54:42] say might I fail yeah you might you
[1:54:45] might still fail but it won't count
[1:54:48] and you won't ever have to go back to
[1:54:49] Tibet again
[1:54:51] you can get on your knees and open a
[1:54:53] direct portal to the throne room of God
[1:54:55] and let me tell you something just like
[1:54:57] Nehemiah just like Ezra none of your
[1:54:59] detractors can keep you from it brother
[1:55:02] Branham says every son and daughter of
[1:55:03] God have a right to have a conference
[1:55:05] with God
[1:55:07] and they linger out there you find that
[1:55:09] in Zechariah 3 you find that in Ezra you
[1:55:11] find that in Nehemiah you find all of
[1:55:13] these naysayers trying to keep the
[1:55:15] blessing off in in Zachariah in the uh
[1:55:17] the the days of Ezra you find that he
[1:55:20] stands up Joshua the high priest I've
[1:55:23] preached on it here and trying to
[1:55:25] condemn the whole nation of Israel based
[1:55:27] on the based on their sins and if he can
[1:55:28] get a guilty he's in God's courtroom
[1:55:31] he walked boldly in
[1:55:34] see Satan used to be able to do that he
[1:55:37] used to be able to come with you into
[1:55:38] the presence of God Calvary changed that
[1:55:40] Thank God now he can't get to you
[1:55:43] because if he's going to get to you he's
[1:55:44] got to come through the blood and then
[1:55:45] he'd be your brother he wouldn't even be
[1:55:46] the devil
[1:55:48] so so the beauty of it is but but in
[1:55:50] Zechariah 3 he tried to argue and if he
[1:55:53] could have won that case God would have
[1:55:55] lost the throne Satan would have took
[1:55:56] over Israel would have been finished and
[1:55:58] you'd be done
[1:55:59] but thank God he triumphed
[1:56:02] and and he dismissed the devil's charge
[1:56:04] not on the basis of works because Israel
[1:56:07] was guilty but he dismissed his charge
[1:56:09] on the basis of election this is
[1:56:12] Jerusalem whom I have chosen
[1:56:15] this is my people you will not bring an
[1:56:18] accusation again against them which are
[1:56:20] in Christ Jesus
[1:56:23] this along with the king's book of
[1:56:25] remembrance friends this was the book of
[1:56:27] The Law of God David loved that book
[1:56:29] David talked about loving it
[1:56:32] this is along with that book of his law
[1:56:34] he has a book of remembrance just like
[1:56:37] in Ezra just like in Esther
[1:56:40] he'll bring you go into his presence let
[1:56:42] me give you some encouragement today if
[1:56:44] you got a need and you got a trial you
[1:56:46] got a question you got something you go
[1:56:47] to the king because I'm here to tell you
[1:56:49] the devil might stand outside and try to
[1:56:51] get you to stop from going on your knees
[1:56:53] he might try to haunt your life with
[1:56:55] every kind of thing just to keep you
[1:56:56] from using your portal
[1:57:00] but you got a right to use it
[1:57:02] you got a right to stop drop and roll
[1:57:04] and use it anywhere you need to on the
[1:57:07] spot you could be at Walmart and use it
[1:57:09] Hallelujah you could be in the woods
[1:57:11] camping and you could be in the house of
[1:57:13] God and use your portal
[1:57:14] Hallelujah and he's real and you can go
[1:57:17] into his presence and the devil can't
[1:57:19] come there hallelujah it's the secret of
[1:57:22] his Pavilion
[1:57:24] oh my he's got his book of his law he's
[1:57:28] got a book of remembrance
[1:57:30] say I'm suffering so bad you know Paul
[1:57:32] wrote to the Corinthians and told him to
[1:57:34] encourage him he said listen I know
[1:57:35] you're suffering
[1:57:37] but if you'll just if you'll just stick
[1:57:39] with it it'll turn to comfort how do you
[1:57:42] know that Paul because it happened to me
[1:57:43] I was suffering but I stuck with it and
[1:57:45] now I have great comfort and he wrote to
[1:57:47] the church you'll have this Comfort if
[1:57:49] you just don't faint
[1:57:51] just don't think just keep pressing see
[1:57:55] you can't lose if you just don't faint
[1:57:58] oh my friends I I've said a lot today
[1:58:01] about this God but I'm here to tell you
[1:58:02] I know this God I speak of
[1:58:04] and I know how his court Works say how
[1:58:06] do you know about Jason from years of
[1:58:08] studying the book of his law
[1:58:10] dedicated my life to studying his law
[1:58:13] book
[1:58:13] I've spent many years in service to him
[1:58:16] and I know from personal experience in
[1:58:19] fact I just as I said to you I just came
[1:58:22] back from
[1:58:23] from his courtroom
[1:58:25] Saturday morning
[1:58:32] itis returned from a case myself
[1:58:36] and and let me give you some good news
[1:58:38] before I tell you this story
[1:58:40] I was able to completely and I don't
[1:58:43] know that I've ever so completely
[1:58:46] triumphed
[1:58:47] over the enemy
[1:58:49] so completely in my life
[1:58:54] I'm 59 and I don't know it's equal I've
[1:58:56] I I've went into deep prayer many times
[1:59:00] and I've had the spirit of God come upon
[1:59:02] me many times and spiritual gifts have
[1:59:05] worked through my life and I've seen it
[1:59:06] hit with perfect accuracy
[1:59:09] but I've never quite had a prayer at
[1:59:12] least a prayer experience like the one I
[1:59:15] had
[1:59:16] the wee hours of Saturday morning
[1:59:22] the beauty of it is it wasn't for me
[1:59:24] only
[1:59:26] it's for you too
[1:59:30] I always take you all with me when I go
[1:59:32] see the king
[1:59:33] I don't know if you know that
[1:59:35] but I always take you all with me
[1:59:38] when I go see the king
[1:59:42] you know now let me just say I'm not
[1:59:45] referring to like brother Brandon's
[1:59:47] experience beyond the curtain of time
[1:59:49] that was a special thing that happened
[1:59:50] to Paul a special thing that happened to
[1:59:52] Elijah I'm not saying I'm not saying
[1:59:54] that wasn't that clearly absolutely
[1:59:56] wasn't that brother I'm so that was even
[1:59:57] more than a vision
[1:59:58] and even mine wasn't a vision but you
[2:00:01] know but listen brother Branham also
[2:00:03] describes that brother Branham also
[2:00:06] describes a traveling in deep prayer
[2:00:09] and that's on tape as well
[2:00:11] that you actually go somewhere that that
[2:00:14] that I found myself ascending into a
[2:00:17] place and when I did the whole scene
[2:00:20] around me changed
[2:00:22] now I can't be responsible for what you
[2:00:25] believe I can scarcely believe it myself
[2:00:27] I'm just here to tell you my wife is a
[2:00:29] witness I couldn't stop crying I was
[2:00:31] trying to make these very notes I'm
[2:00:32] using right now just trying to get notes
[2:00:35] to tell you this experience while it was
[2:00:37] fresh in my mind
[2:00:42] I found myself ascending into a place
[2:00:44] and the whole scene around me changed
[2:00:46] and I wasn't just merely kneeling on my
[2:00:48] knees in my living room at my 5 a.m
[2:00:51] chair anymore I was I was aware I was
[2:00:53] still there don't don't make this more
[2:00:55] than it was I was perfectly aware of
[2:00:57] where I was
[2:00:58] but somehow I went somewhere in my mind
[2:01:01] and the scene was so vivid and so real
[2:01:06] and I went somewhere that's the only way
[2:01:08] I can describe it I was able to bring
[2:01:09] and here's the beauty here here's a
[2:01:12] beauty I was able to bring
[2:01:14] and I caught a revelation
[2:01:17] I've always wondered did he just mean
[2:01:19] that for William Branham all that you
[2:01:21] ever loved and all that ever loved you
[2:01:24] God has given you now I'm not claiming
[2:01:27] equality to that but I I found myself
[2:01:30] saying Lord all that I ever loved and
[2:01:34] all that ever loved me is here with me
[2:01:36] and I looked around and it was you all
[2:01:39] and it was my church and I realized
[2:01:41] maybe that's where it applies to a local
[2:01:43] Minister I don't know I'm still trying
[2:01:45] to figure this out
[2:01:46] but I had all of y'all and y'all we had
[2:01:49] literally we had come in out of the
[2:01:51] darkness and we were stepped into a
[2:01:52] court
[2:01:58] it was brilliant
[2:02:01] brought all of you into God's presence
[2:02:03] Saturday morning
[2:02:05] while you were sleeping
[2:02:08] while you were sleeping
[2:02:10] I took you with me on a journey
[2:02:14] and while the whole group stood in the
[2:02:16] glow of his judgment Hall
[2:02:19] that he had he had entered into his
[2:02:22] judgment Hall I asked for an audience
[2:02:23] and he entered into his judgment hall
[2:02:26] now what's amazing is I had asked for
[2:02:29] this on Friday morning
[2:02:31] when I was praying Friday morning I said
[2:02:34] Lord and I had some private things and
[2:02:37] personal burdens and things going on in
[2:02:39] my mind and I said Lord oh I I just need
[2:02:42] that special something and here I was I
[2:02:44] thought my it's not even a day later and
[2:02:47] he's I was stunned that was happening so
[2:02:48] fast I said my goodness you're already
[2:02:51] doing it friends listen I'm I'm on my
[2:02:53] knees I'm fully aware that I'm in my
[2:02:55] living room in the dark on my knees but
[2:02:57] all I can tell you is there was
[2:02:58] something of me somewhere else
[2:03:02] and of course I was first you know
[2:03:05] I I I I I I I had the whole group stood
[2:03:08] in this glow of his judgment Hall
[2:03:11] and naturally I was I had to First
[2:03:14] secure my own place before him a feat
[2:03:17] not not not not without resistance from
[2:03:19] the enemy who stands outside who stood
[2:03:22] outside to oppose me you know and uh he
[2:03:26] I mean this is this this is why
[2:03:29] you see he he can't enter there now that
[2:03:33] I mean that's why John in Revelation 5
[2:03:36] doesn't seem when the book is claimed
[2:03:38] you notice that there's one on the
[2:03:40] throne there's a strong Angel there's a
[2:03:42] there's a lamb comes there's the Four
[2:03:44] and Twenty Elders there's the sea of
[2:03:45] glass there's there's Heavenly Angels
[2:03:48] but there's no Lucifer because why the
[2:03:51] lamb is coming to claim the book
[2:03:53] Hallelujah and Satan can no longer
[2:03:55] accuse you he's dismiss summarily from
[2:03:59] God's Courtney he God will not hear an
[2:04:01] accusation against his family
[2:04:06] once I had secured my own position
[2:04:12] plead
[2:04:13] through a through a fresh cleansing of
[2:04:16] my own heart and my own mind at that
[2:04:17] point I'm here to tell you at that point
[2:04:19] I was kneeling there and I was so aware
[2:04:21] wow
[2:04:22] the enemy is already defeated
[2:04:26] I knew
[2:04:28] that since he has had cleansed me
[2:04:31] and my heart condemned me not
[2:04:34] than I Knew by the study of his book of
[2:04:36] law
[2:04:37] I Knew by his book that I could have
[2:04:39] confidence toward God because my heart
[2:04:42] condemned me not at that point I had no
[2:04:45] condemnation
[2:04:47] not for anything no matter how heinous
[2:04:49] in all my life I literally stood in the
[2:04:53] presence of the king secure
[2:04:57] at this point I had nothing wavering
[2:05:00] I knew I was standing there with no
[2:05:02] condemnation even possible to me because
[2:05:04] I was in Christ in Romans 7 tells us
[2:05:06] that I knew that this being in Christ I
[2:05:10] knew that this being in Christ was a
[2:05:14] place that you could come into boldly
[2:05:17] not as a beggar not as a beggar but as a
[2:05:21] as a member of the royal family as a
[2:05:23] prince as the son of the Kingdom
[2:05:25] that's what the word has done for you in
[2:05:28] your life friends
[2:05:29] I knew at this point there was no weapon
[2:05:32] formed against me that could prosper and
[2:05:35] quickly realizing the full height and
[2:05:37] depth of what God had done at that
[2:05:39] moment I hurried quickly and brought
[2:05:42] four cases
[2:05:44] forward
[2:05:46] to stand in front of him
[2:05:53] those four cases were the most critical
[2:05:55] at the moment those highest on my list
[2:05:57] of the present distresses
[2:06:00] you should know
[2:06:03] that this was not the place of grandeur
[2:06:06] not the one that we will gather around
[2:06:07] someday as seen in Revelation it wasn't
[2:06:09] like that no it was more like a place
[2:06:11] where you could meet him alone and have
[2:06:14] your case heard with immediacy
[2:06:18] Eddie
[2:06:20] used to tell me a dream as a little boy
[2:06:22] I grew up as a man making him retell it
[2:06:25] over and over and over again before he
[2:06:26] passed away he wrote all of his dreams I
[2:06:28] have a record of them
[2:06:30] and brother Eddie said one day he
[2:06:33] he had a dream that
[2:06:35] he walked out it was night it was dark
[2:06:37] just dark darkness everywhere and he
[2:06:41] said he walked out on a raised like a
[2:06:43] raised Jetty like a peninsula narrow
[2:06:46] only four or five feet wide but it was
[2:06:48] five or six inches above the waves and
[2:06:51] he walked out on it and he says all of
[2:06:53] those black churning waves he knew was
[2:06:56] judgment
[2:06:57] and he knew God was showing him
[2:06:59] something in a dream and all this
[2:07:01] judgment that was trying to get him and
[2:07:02] trying to overwhelm him but he said I
[2:07:04] realized as I looked around it can't
[2:07:07] touch me
[2:07:08] I'm above it
[2:07:10] and he says something struck me
[2:07:14] a feeling come over me brother Eddie
[2:07:16] described he said a feeling come over me
[2:07:17] I thought my goodness
[2:07:20] I could forgive sin
[2:07:24] I said that's quite a feeling he goes
[2:07:25] yeah that's how I felt he said the love
[2:07:28] was so pure
[2:07:30] the feeling in my heart was so real he
[2:07:33] said I thought I could forgive sin
[2:07:35] he stood and I realized now I thought
[2:07:38] about brother Eddie's dreams I was
[2:07:40] standing there a place this this place
[2:07:42] this remember this is just it's just a
[2:07:45] small place of light it the best way I
[2:07:48] can describe it to you is a place in the
[2:07:50] middle of the battlefield a small
[2:07:51] sanctuary of light right in the big
[2:07:53] middle of Darkness everywhere that we
[2:07:56] call everyday life
[2:07:57] we're surrounded by Darkness but you're
[2:08:00] a light in the midst of Darkness
[2:08:03] that's where we are friends where
[2:08:04] royalty standing in the presence of the
[2:08:07] king
[2:08:08] and I had the ability against all of
[2:08:11] Satan's yapping and yapping and yapping
[2:08:13] I had the ability to walk into his court
[2:08:15] say how did you get there I walked into
[2:08:17] my living room and went down on my knees
[2:08:19] and began to lift up my voice and I my
[2:08:21] portal started turning and the next
[2:08:24] thing you know I'm I'm ascending up
[2:08:26] somewhere
[2:08:28] Hallelujah
[2:08:31] placed right in the middle of the
[2:08:33] battlefield a place you can only get to
[2:08:35] in prayer a place where all are the
[2:08:37] voices and oppositions cannot enter a
[2:08:39] place where you and the King are alone
[2:08:41] in his Pavilion
[2:08:43] it's hard to describe how I felt
[2:08:44] standing there but I can tell you
[2:08:47] that I knew it was some special place
[2:08:49] and I knew it was some special moment it
[2:08:52] was a place of perfect love it was a
[2:08:54] place of perfect faith it was a place of
[2:08:56] perfect acceptance I don't know how to
[2:08:58] describe it any better
[2:09:00] I felt
[2:09:02] at this moment
[2:09:04] perfect
[2:09:06] everything I was so aware that
[2:09:11] everything I had ever done
[2:09:13] was struck off
[2:09:16] and I was standing in the presence of
[2:09:18] the king
[2:09:20] oh my there was nothing to hinder me
[2:09:22] nothing could touch me
[2:09:25] like my dad's dream it was like a clean
[2:09:27] dry place where the Waters of judgment
[2:09:30] couldn't reach
[2:09:31] and and and I was I and I I made up my
[2:09:34] mind at that moment now you'd think you
[2:09:36] couldn't do this but I had the presence
[2:09:38] of mine at that moment when I realized
[2:09:40] how special this is because it's
[2:09:42] happening in real time and I'm I'm
[2:09:44] saying oh this is so special this is oh
[2:09:48] and I quickly I thought about four four
[2:09:50] critical needs that have been on my
[2:09:52] heart for a while right here in this
[2:09:53] audience
[2:09:55] and I thought and there's more than four
[2:09:57] but these were four that are the most
[2:09:59] distressing at the moment for the
[2:10:00] present danger
[2:10:02] and I in my mind I quickly quickly I
[2:10:05] thought I'm not going to miss out and I
[2:10:07] grabbed these four people four of you
[2:10:10] it was five it was it was five of you
[2:10:12] because it was four in three individuals
[2:10:13] and a husband and a wife and I quickly
[2:10:15] brought you forward and I became this
[2:10:18] Lord this need and I've talked to you
[2:10:22] about it and I've prayed and we've
[2:10:24] talked it over and I've asked you they
[2:10:26] need your help Lord and and and the king
[2:10:28] is just listening to me
[2:10:30] and and I was talking about these four
[2:10:33] critical needs and and I even gestured

[2:14:06] he's preaching that sermon he cares do
[2:14:08] you care and brother Branham just God
[2:14:09] does he care and he goes through the
[2:14:12] Bible and pulls out case after case and
[2:14:14] he says does he care oh my goodness how
[2:14:17] much he cares see but you
[2:14:21] got to care first
[2:14:23] and if you care about his word he'll
[2:14:27] care about your soul
[2:14:28] he'll care about your need if you care
[2:14:31] enough to be sincere when you pray and
[2:14:33] pray often and give your whole heart and
[2:14:36] Life to God let me tell you something
[2:14:37] friends
[2:14:41] I hope
[2:14:43] I stood thinking about that all day
[2:14:45] Saturday and I thought about it again
[2:14:46] this morning and I said to the Lord
[2:14:48] Saturday I said Lord
[2:14:50] could I have that every time I pray
[2:14:52] is that even possible
[2:14:56] did I
[2:14:57] turn a certain combination on the portal
[2:14:59] did I put in a certain code did was
[2:15:02] there something I said
[2:15:04] and you know I found where brother
[2:15:05] Branham said talks about those
[2:15:07] High Realms that a prophet goes way up
[2:15:10] far far far above anywhere I went to
[2:15:14] I actually just went into a sanctuary
[2:15:16] right in the middle of the battlefield
[2:15:18] prophets went up and saw things in
[2:15:20] heaven and glory and saw way off in
[2:15:22] Prophecy
[2:15:23] nothing compared to that but brother
[2:15:26] Branham even comes back from that he
[2:15:27] says now when I get there he says I come
[2:15:29] back down he says oh I wish I could live
[2:15:30] there all the time
[2:15:32] see but that's what makes it special
[2:15:34] so you you can I want I want you to
[2:15:37] remember after today
[2:15:41] while you're tucked asleep in your beds
[2:15:44] in your
[2:15:46] pillowy softness you just remember
[2:15:48] you're somewhere else also
[2:15:51] because the shepherd who loves you
[2:15:54] and I take you with me every time I go
[2:15:56] and you know what I'm going to do
[2:15:57] tomorrow I want to take you with me
[2:15:58] again
[2:15:59] I know I'm gonna do the next day I'm
[2:16:01] gonna take you with me again
[2:16:03] and I I'd love to come get you and not
[2:16:05] find you and get there and you're
[2:16:06] already there
[2:16:07] does that make sense
[2:16:09] oh I say I'm not sure any of this makes
[2:16:11] sense brother Jason well joined the
[2:16:13] party but all I know is is telling you
[2:16:16] the best I could describe
[2:16:18] in my heart
[2:16:20] God loves us
[2:16:23] and he's aware of every need you have
[2:16:26] bow your heads with me all over the
[2:16:28] building
[2:16:29] [Music]
[2:16:35] well Lord there it is
[2:16:38] I did my best
[2:16:41] I told the truth I was very careful
[2:16:44] be careful with what I said I don't I
[2:16:47] don't want to make it more than it was
[2:16:49] but I'm sure not going to make it less
[2:16:52] and just because there were certain
[2:16:54] elements I couldn't fully explain I I
[2:16:57] know what happened
[2:16:59] and Lord I I just say
[2:17:02] as Gulliver said these things are all
[2:17:04] true and happen to me
[2:17:08] and I thank you for it Lord
[2:17:10] and I I was left with that that
[2:17:13] marvelous sense
[2:17:16] that I had stood in your approval
[2:17:19] and all those you have given me and love
[2:17:21] me and those who I love
[2:17:24] they were there with me
[2:17:26] and you were rejecting of none of them
[2:17:29] you allowed all of them entry with me
[2:17:32] and they stood in the glow of your light
[2:17:33] Just Around Me Lord like a semicircle
[2:17:37] and I looked back and I looked into
[2:17:39] their faces and I pointed to this one
[2:17:40] and gestured to that one I said Lord
[2:17:42] this one too and this also and what
[2:17:44] about this and this over here
[2:17:46] and I felt that same acceptance from the
[2:17:48] King
[2:17:50] so I want this church to take courage
[2:17:51] today Lord I know this is a perilous day
[2:17:54] I know it's more perilous than any other
[2:17:56] time in history
[2:17:58] but I know you're not unaware and I want
[2:18:01] to say today to the people
[2:18:04] that the King has had a fresh hearing
[2:18:07] of all your needs
[2:18:13] and he's concerned
[2:18:15] and he cares
[2:18:18] and I want to tell you today that I'm
[2:18:20] privileged above none of you
[2:18:22] that every one of you having come back
[2:18:24] from it I can tell you from experience
[2:18:26] all heads bowed now
[2:18:28] I can tell you from experience every one
[2:18:31] of you who have passed from Death to
[2:18:32] life and who have known Jesus and the
[2:18:35] power of his resurrection you have the
[2:18:37] same access I have
[2:18:39] you can walk boldly into his throne and
[2:18:43] stand there redeemed clean pure in
[2:18:46] perfect love in perfect Faith no
[2:18:48] condemnation nothing to hinder you all
[2:18:51] other voices silent

[2:18:57] the final
[2:18:58] piece that I want to give to these
[2:19:00] people that they have the same access
