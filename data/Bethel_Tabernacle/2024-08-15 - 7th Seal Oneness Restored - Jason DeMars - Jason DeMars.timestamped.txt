[48:00] that you have a a special evening for us
[48:03] tonight Lord to get become more like
[48:06] Jesus
[48:07] Christ and so Lord we know that this is
[48:10] what the opening of the seventh seal has
[48:12] come to do is make us more like
[48:14] Jesus a greater
[48:19] reflection Oneness
[48:22] restored we thank you for that
[48:24] Lord and we ask one once again father
[48:28] let us all step out of the way may we
[48:31] lay aside the cares of this life and the

[48:57] through US Lord to make it in this
[48:59] hour we look to you we commit ourselves
[49:02] to you we ask once again for your
[49:04] anointing to come upon your word Lord
[49:06] and that you would declare yourself to
[49:08] us tonight in Jesus name amen God bless
[49:11] you Saints we'll go right to the word I
[49:14] had planned on
[49:16] doing a missions report tonight and
[49:19] maybe I'll do it later but coming out to
[49:21] such an atmosphere I felt that it would
[49:24] be too drastic of a change of order go
[49:26] into a missions report and I want to go
[49:29] right to the word in Revelation 8 verse
[49:32] one my subject tonight is the seventh
[49:35] seal Oneness
[49:38] restored and when he had opened the
[49:41] seventh seal there was silence in heaven
[49:45] about the space of half an
[49:47] hour and so everything was quiet was
[49:51] silent was a holy hush the greatest
[49:55] beings as we saw saw this all this whole
[49:58] picture set the greatest beings in all
[50:01] of creation were there before the throne
[50:04] and they stood in awe and amazement at
[50:08] the opening of the seventh seal they
[50:09] knew that at the opening of this seal
[50:12] the now the book of redemption is fully
[50:14] unsealed and opened and something
[50:17] spectacular must soon take place which
[50:20] was even hidden to the very angels of
[50:23] heaven and at the time uh that Jesus was
[50:26] on Earth it was even hidden from the son
[50:30] the father only knew it and now there's
[50:32] a great Revelation that's about to take
[50:34] place then we go to ver verse two and I
[50:37] saw the seven angels which stood before
[50:40] God and to them were given seven
[50:42] trumpets and another angel came and
[50:44] stood at the altar having a golden
[50:46] sensor and there was given unto him much
[50:49] incense that he should offer it with the
[50:51] prayers of all the saints upon the
[50:54] golden altar which was before the throne
[50:57] and the smoke of the incense which came
[50:59] with the prayers of the Saints send it
[51:01] up before God out of the Angels hands
[51:05] and the angel took the sensor and it
[51:07] filled it with fire of the Altar and
[51:09] cast it into the Earth and there were
[51:12] voices and thunderings and Lightnings
[51:14] and an earthquake May the Lord add the
[51:16] blessing to the reading of his word he
[51:18] can be
[51:22] seated and so we see these angels
[51:28] they're
[51:29] standing after the opening of the
[51:31] seventh seal and they're standing as
[51:34] though they in a Priestly role there
[51:38] before God to soon blow these trumpets
[51:44] and remember we spoke before and brother
[51:47] Jason has spoke the trumpets always call
[51:50] Israel to the feast they're used of God
[51:53] to bring Israel back into the their
[51:57] position when Israel returns to the land
[52:00] they do so under the work of the seven
[52:04] Trumpets the trumpets sound through the
[52:06] age however they're revealed by the two
[52:10] witnesses during the tribulation period
[52:14] so just as the seals come to us as a
[52:18] revelation at the End of the Age though
[52:20] they happen throughout the age and and
[52:23] and and the events even go after the
[52:25] opening of that seventh seal so will the
[52:28] trumpets have the same effect upon the
[52:33] 144,000 through those two
[52:36] witnesses but before that can happen
[52:39] before that Revelation can happen during
[52:42] the tribulation period another Angel
[52:45] comes
[52:47] forward another Angel comes forward and
[52:49] is given incense to burn with the
[52:53] prayers of the Saints so he's coming
[52:56] into the go area where there's a golden
[52:58] altar right where what else is in the
[53:01] area of the golden altar seven golden
[53:04] candlesticks so who walks in the midst
[53:07] of seven golden candlesticks other than
[53:11] the Lord Jesus Christ one like unto the
[53:15] son of man amen and so then we have this
[53:18] High Priestly position entering into
[53:21] that there's many details to this that I
[53:23] want I don't want to get bogged down if
[53:25] anybody has questions you're always
[53:27] welcome to get in touch with me but I
[53:30] just want to go quickly over this
[53:31] because it's it's not the main point so
[53:34] this Angel entering into this High
[53:37] Priestly position now he comes not by
[53:39] The Mercy Seat The Mercy Seat issue has
[53:44] has already been dealt with in previous
[53:47] chapters in The Book of Revelation now
[53:49] here he stands not in the most holy
[53:52] place in heaven but in the Holy place to
[53:55] offer incense and the incense notice
[53:58] he's going to offer given unto him much
[54:01] incense that he should offer it with the
[54:05] prayers of all the saints so the prayers
[54:08] of all the saints is a smoke from The
[54:11] Altar and the prayer and the incense is
[54:14] also causing a smoke from the altar it's
[54:17] not the same there's a distinction right
[54:21] and so uh we understand if we look in
[54:24] the Old Testament God when when when God
[54:26] was angry with the children of Israel
[54:29] God spoke to Moses and said Aaron take a
[54:32] sensor and burn incense among the people
[54:35] to act as an atonement for them you
[54:38] think well without the shedding of blood
[54:40] there's no remission absolutely that's
[54:42] right and of course when we look at
[54:45] anything in the Book of Revelation we
[54:46] have to understand it in the context of
[54:49] the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[54:52] yet we have different types throughout
[54:54] the Old Testament and here we see
[54:56] enacting another type before us that at
[55:00] the opening of the seventh seal there's
[55:03] an incense
[55:05] atonement which is the application a
[55:08] further application of the blood of
[55:11] Christ upon the
[55:14] bride for us in this hour that's
[55:17] good and so again it cannot be a part of
[55:20] from the blood of Jesus Christ if there
[55:22] is going to be any kind of offering made
[55:25] we understand that it is connected to
[55:27] the blood of Jesus
[55:29] Christ and okay so when we see the smoke
[55:33] of the incense we understand it
[55:36] represents the worthiness the Merit
[55:39] merits the righteousness of Jesus Christ
[55:43] through his very blood which was shed
[55:45] for us he is he he he is our
[55:48] righteousness and he lived the righteous
[55:52] life for us this altar then of course
[55:56] would have been cleansed by the
[55:58] blood but yet there had to be had to
[56:01] come a time of incense being burnt and
[56:06] it's not the incense is not our works
[56:10] the incense is not the work of the Seven
[56:12] Angels the incense is the work of Christ
[56:15] in our place his perfect
[56:19] righteousness that's what makes our
[56:20] prayers acceptable to God so when the
[56:23] smoke of our prayers Rises up and the
[56:26] smoke of the incense Rises up they
[56:28] become one wow so there's a Oneness
[56:31] between the work of Christ and the bride
[56:34] of Christ the prayers of the saints that
[56:36] happens under the seventh seal and so
[56:39] you can't separate now the work of
[56:42] Christ and the work of the Bride because
[56:46] what when you look at this atonement
[56:48] that's made for us by the incense we
[56:51] understand that the atonement is is
[56:53] activating
[56:54] something for the the prayers of the
[56:57] Saints it's a restoration back to what
[56:59] God intended for us in John
[57:03] 14:12 The Works that I do shall he do
[57:06] also this is only restored in part under
[57:09] the man age under the Pentecostal
[57:11] message they only have a part of it the
[57:14] full Pentecostal blessing is not
[57:17] restored until the fullness of the word
[57:19] is
[57:20] restored to us through the seventh
[57:22] Church age messenger and so we have then
[57:25] the incense combin ining with the
[57:26] prayers of the Saints this is your
[57:28] greatest
[57:29] work this is your greatest
[57:31] accomplishment is your prayers and God
[57:34] does more through your prayers and when
[57:36] you realize that the smoke of the
[57:38] incense of your prayers is actually
[57:41] literally one with the atoning work of
[57:44] Christ that actually his very atoning
[57:47] work is applicable right in the midst of
[57:49] your prayer that we understand that the
[57:52] scripture tells us that that the spirit
[57:55] we don't know what we pray as we ought
[57:57] but the spirit with groanings which
[57:59] cannot be uttered he pray he intercedes
[58:02] through us so when you can understand
[58:04] that the work of Christ is by the
[58:06] fullness of the holy spirit in the bride
[58:09] interceding through the Bride of Jesus
[58:12] Christ now you're catching the
[58:13] revelation of the seventh
[58:16] seal and we can never get a apart from
[58:20] this Oneness the seventh seal is
[58:23] revealed in every type that's in the
[58:25] Bible the prophet said that that we
[58:27] understand it's a
[58:28] three-fold uh uh three-fold Port
[58:32] unfolding I don't know how to say that
[58:34] properly but it's a three-fold unfolding
[58:36] under the seventh seal brother bam said
[58:38] one unfolded when they were speaking
[58:40] about the Sixth Seal remember he spoke
[58:42] about all seven seals are in Revelation
[58:45] chap 24 six of them have all information
[58:49] he says the seventh is left
[58:52] off the Angels didn't know the sun
[58:55] didn't know
[58:57] himself all right that's the first one
[59:00] the second one came during the preaching
[59:03] of the seventh seal and and he says
[59:05] that's the seven Thunders that also
[59:08] won't be known he says till the end
[59:11] time it's connected together he makes
[59:14] that point again and again the last one
[59:17] comes in an unknown language says the
[59:21] end time seal starts when the end time
[59:24] seal starts it will be a total total
[59:27] secret but but I love that but it will
[59:30] be revealed by the
[59:32] messenger of Revelation
[59:36] 107 so again one no man knows the day or
[59:38] the hour two seven Thunders three it's
[59:41] an unknown
[59:42] language he says the seventh seal is the
[59:45] end of all things ushers in the
[59:47] Millennium seven Thunders will not be
[59:50] known until that time it not it he even
[59:53] said it it's connected to the third pole
[59:56] and that it will not be thoroughly
[59:59] explained but it will be revealed by the
[1:00:01] seventh angel once again I I'm repeating
[1:00:04] that and so I I I'm just going to pause
[1:00:08] going forward and feel to share my own
[1:00:11] testimony and journey regarding the
[1:00:13] seventh seal when I first came to the
[1:00:15] message I was I didn't know any of y'all
[1:00:18] even existed I was up in Minneapolis
[1:00:20] somebody gave me a church ages book I
[1:00:23] started feeding on the message step by
[1:00:25] step the Lord led me to the truth I'm
[1:00:27] reading I'm studying I'm looking at the
[1:00:29] seals I'm looking at the church ages
[1:00:31] book I'm I'm searching and one uh uh
[1:00:35] brother comes to me and says so what do
[1:00:37] you think the seven Thunders are and I
[1:00:40] said well that's oh I said I believe
[1:00:43] what brother brandham said is that
[1:00:45] accomplishes the restoration of the
[1:00:47] original faith and that under under you
[1:00:51] know they reveal they're revealing what
[1:00:54] the Seven Seals are all about
[1:00:56] and that un on the book in the book is
[1:00:59] things that are revealed like uh this is
[1:01:01] just where I was at at the time things
[1:01:04] like who is this MDC and marriage and
[1:01:06] divorce and those things are in the
[1:01:08] mysterious mysterious book this is what
[1:01:10] my understanding is oh man you really
[1:01:12] missed
[1:01:13] it you really messed up I I didn't you
[1:01:16] read the seven seal it's not revealed we
[1:01:19] don't we don't know what the seventh
[1:01:21] seal is I like oh man this is an elder
[1:01:24] in the he's been in the message for for
[1:01:26] almost as long longer than I've been
[1:01:29] alive I must be in confusion and the L
[1:01:32] and and I was sent into 12 years of
[1:01:36] total and utter confusion and I begin to
[1:01:40] study what Raymond Jackson said about it
[1:01:43] oh only six seals Seven Seals not
[1:01:45] revealed not even open then I read what
[1:01:48] another brother overseas said it's oh no
[1:01:50] the Seven Seals were broken back in ' 96
[1:01:53] ad and the Seven Thunder are coming in
[1:01:56] the future there'll be seven men that
[1:01:59] come that that will come and speak
[1:02:01] rapturing Faith to the bride and then I
[1:02:04] then I asked brother Lonnie what was his
[1:02:06] understanding seemed to line up with my
[1:02:07] first understanding but I kept coming
[1:02:10] across quotes that that what about this
[1:02:12] what about that and I was just confused
[1:02:15] total confusion believe my first
[1:02:18] understanding Revelation was right but I
[1:02:20] went through a cloud of misunderstanding
[1:02:24] for 12 years and I was literally on the
[1:02:26] missions field looking at these Persian
[1:02:28] brothers and saying Lord I have no idea
[1:02:33] you know I've tried to study this and
[1:02:35] I've literally given up would you please
[1:02:37] help
[1:02:39] me understand this because these
[1:02:41] brothers need it's in the message it's
[1:02:44] for us to understand and there's an
[1:02:46] explanation and these brothers need it
[1:02:48] because it's really important part of
[1:02:50] the message that the prophet speaks
[1:02:52] about over and over again and I'm the
[1:02:54] missionary here that's confused
[1:02:57] and the sitting in a taxi cab the Lord
[1:03:00] said what order does that happen
[1:03:02] in said the mighty Angel descends with
[1:03:06] an open book Seven Thunders under their
[1:03:08] voices and the seventh Church age
[1:03:10] messenger finishes the
[1:03:12] mystery
[1:03:15] yes and then immediately it was all the
[1:03:18] scales fell off my eyes then I could go
[1:03:21] back to study the message and I saw it
[1:03:23] everywhere everywhere that I
[1:03:27] went so thank God that that made became
[1:03:31] an anchor in my heart that no devil in
[1:03:34] hell can pull it away from me I believe
[1:03:37] it has to be for every one of us I can
[1:03:39] explain it to you I can speak it to you
[1:03:41] but it's it's comes in unknown tongues
[1:03:46] amen and it must become a revelation
[1:03:49] into your heart and as brother brandom
[1:03:51] said don't try to be fanatical make up
[1:03:55] some strange doctrines but live a Godly
[1:03:59] Christian Life he emphasized that over
[1:04:01] and over again amen and I believe that's
[1:04:04] the unknown the manifestation of the
[1:04:07] unknown tongue is your life manifesting
[1:04:12] the Oneness of Christ and the
[1:04:16] bride and so again you you look and
[1:04:18] you'll see and the the the the things
[1:04:20] that became a confusion to me in the
[1:04:22] future home he says we have six seals
[1:04:24] were revealed out there oh my what's
[1:04:27] going on here th though there's 27 pages
[1:04:31] of quotes about Seven Seals being
[1:04:34] revealed you have these different places
[1:04:36] and and even in the seventh seal itself
[1:04:38] you see we have the completion now of
[1:04:42] six seals and we know the seventh can't
[1:04:45] be broke to the
[1:04:47] public and you see these different
[1:04:49] things and we understand when he said
[1:04:52] when he spoke
[1:04:53] about six seals
[1:04:56] in Matthew 24 the seventh was left off
[1:05:01] right so does that mean that's all there
[1:05:04] is to it it's finished it's over with
[1:05:08] well that's what people thought he says
[1:05:11] in question is answer is number four
[1:05:14] have the seven Thunders which equals
[1:05:16] seven Mysteries already been revealed
[1:05:18] were they revealed in the Seven Seals
[1:05:20] but are yet not known to us as the
[1:05:22] Thunders yet no they were revealed in
[1:05:25] the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders
[1:05:28] was about seven Thunders that had
[1:05:30] uttered their voices and no one could
[1:05:32] make out what it was John knew what it
[1:05:33] was but he was forbidden to write it he
[1:05:36] said but the seventh angel in the days
[1:05:38] of his sounding listen to this this is
[1:05:40] Brother
[1:05:41] branham's
[1:05:43] um
[1:05:45] interpretation or synopsis of Revelation
[1:05:49] 10:7 and and we'll comment on it this is
[1:05:51] his synopsis he says but the seventh
[1:05:54] angel in the days of his s found in the
[1:05:56] seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders
[1:05:59] would be revealed amen so whatever the
[1:06:03] seven Thunders spoke have already been
[1:06:06] revealed by the seventh Church age
[1:06:10] messenger and so connect it together in
[1:06:13] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:06:14] angel what does it say when he's about
[1:06:17] to sound the mystery of God should be
[1:06:19] finished as it was revealed to his
[1:06:21] servants the prophets but brother
[1:06:23] Branham finishes the verse with the
[1:06:25] seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders
[1:06:27] would be revealed so what is the mystery
[1:06:30] of
[1:06:31] God the seven Mysteries of the seven
[1:06:33] Thunders would be revealed that which
[1:06:36] was hidden John knew it he was forbidden
[1:06:38] to write it but it was H it was a hidden
[1:06:40] Mystery it's then revealed and finished
[1:06:45] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:06:48] messenger and it's it's significant that
[1:06:50] it says as it was revealed to his
[1:06:52] servants the prophets brother bandam
[1:06:54] says it can't be a new Bible can't be
[1:06:57] some new revelation it's what's already
[1:06:59] written in the word it's been hidden and
[1:07:03] sealed away from the church because
[1:07:04] they've Fallen away from the original
[1:07:06] Faith but now it's it's broken open and
[1:07:09] revealed and restored back to the Bride
[1:07:13] of course in the church ages book some
[1:07:15] people like to dismiss the church ages
[1:07:17] book I'm not one of
[1:07:20] them it's it says the same thing just in
[1:07:23] a more detailed way people say well
[1:07:25] brother brandham never said this in uh
[1:07:27] in his sermons he said this this is the
[1:07:31] details this is the breakdown I just
[1:07:34] read it to you all right in chapter n
[1:07:37] now this messenger of Malachi 4 in
[1:07:39] Revelation 10:7 is going to do two
[1:07:40] things one according to Malachi 4 he
[1:07:43] will turn the hearts of the children to
[1:07:44] the fathers two he will reveal the
[1:07:46] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:07:48] Revelation 10 which are the revelations
[1:07:50] contained in the Seven Seals it will be
[1:07:53] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[1:07:55] that literally turn the hearts of the
[1:07:57] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:07:59] exactly so so the seven Thunders are
[1:08:04] restoring us back to the original Faith
[1:08:07] the opening of The Seven Seals there th
[1:08:10] that's that's the Revelation that comes
[1:08:12] to us but then there's a book that comes
[1:08:14] down from heaven and there's Mysteries
[1:08:17] contained in the book and seven Thunders
[1:08:20] utter those Mysteries to the prophet of
[1:08:22] God we don't we don't literally hear
[1:08:25] seven Thunders speak we the prophet
[1:08:28] hears the seven Thunders speak the
[1:08:31] prophet hearing those seven Thunders
[1:08:33] speak then communicates the Revelation
[1:08:35] to the people but do you realize that
[1:08:38] Revelation 10 doesn't end at verse
[1:08:42] 7 because the goal of the finishing of
[1:08:44] the mystery was the was The Taking of
[1:08:46] the
[1:08:47] book and it's an it's actually if you
[1:08:50] realize it it's an it's it's for the
[1:08:52] bride body as a whole but each one of of
[1:08:55] us as individuals must enter into the
[1:08:58] experience of the taking of the
[1:09:01] book you you you can't just say oh great
[1:09:04] the prophecy is fulfilled no you have to
[1:09:07] take the book you have to eat it and
[1:09:11] have the experience and say my it's
[1:09:13] sweet then it has to get into your
[1:09:15] stomach and say
[1:09:16] whoa okay I got some changing to do I
[1:09:19] got some
[1:09:20] transformation to do this is bitter on
[1:09:23] my belly because I got God's got some
[1:09:25] work to
[1:09:27] do but then ites even doesn't finish
[1:09:30] there because we realize the bride then
[1:09:33] actually is the final voice to the final
[1:09:35] age under their messenger when they
[1:09:38] catch get the revelation of what the
[1:09:40] prophet said is is we're not called to
[1:09:42] be parrots but we're called to
[1:09:45] communicate the
[1:09:46] Revelation it's different you can be a
[1:09:48] parrot and you can say word by word what
[1:09:50] brother brandham said and not say what
[1:09:51] he
[1:09:52] meant and and it it it's it's Way Beyond
[1:09:58] mere understanding and parsing out of
[1:10:00] English language but it's supernatural
[1:10:03] Revelation that has to come to the bride
[1:10:06] and we understand that it it's it's a
[1:10:08] season right since it's the days of the
[1:10:11] son of man it's not the instant of the
[1:10:14] son of man if you can if you can really
[1:10:17] realize it when brother brandham says
[1:10:19] the seventh is left off we understand
[1:10:22] the seventh is actually a person amen
[1:10:26] if you really can grasp it the seventh
[1:10:27] is a person descending from heaven with
[1:10:30] an open book to reveal it to you and
[1:10:33] actually to to give it to you to eat and
[1:10:36] then the next thing that you must do is
[1:10:38] you must speak the word that's already
[1:10:41] been spoken it's not enough to just
[1:10:43] press
[1:10:45] play every one of us should press play
[1:10:47] because we must feed on the message of
[1:10:50] the hour we must feed on on on the tapes
[1:10:55] yeah the mp3s and and this because in in
[1:10:58] the ages past we understand what's the
[1:11:01] devil done he says oh that's only for
[1:11:03] the
[1:11:04] ministers the word is only for the
[1:11:06] ministers and the people they don't need
[1:11:08] that no we all need it because it's an
[1:11:11] accountability to the word for all of us
[1:11:15] each one of you C can't just sit there
[1:11:18] and say oh I just take in what the
[1:11:19] anointed preacher says you have to study
[1:11:23] you have to seek
[1:11:25] you have to
[1:11:27] eat part of eating is hearing the word
[1:11:30] but not the only part you've you've got
[1:11:32] to assimilate it for yourself you could
[1:11:36] sit and and listen to me preach and
[1:11:38] listen to brother J Jason preach and not
[1:11:40] understand a single word Judas had the
[1:11:42] best
[1:11:43] pastor in the whole world and he didn't
[1:11:46] turn out well that wasn't the pastor's
[1:11:50] fault that was the man's fault and
[1:11:53] that's your fault if you don't take what
[1:11:56] brother Jason is is preaching to us and
[1:11:58] feed on it and understand it you just
[1:12:00] come to church well it's an
[1:12:02] experience oh come on the word of life
[1:12:05] is being given to you write it down
[1:12:08] study it look at it refer back to it
[1:12:11] feed on it so that you really understand
[1:12:13] it because this is where the rapturing
[1:12:15] faith comes from Revelation 10 8-11 is
[1:12:19] talking about rapturing faith and it's
[1:12:21] not it's even not enough just to eat it
[1:12:25] you have to speak
[1:12:27] it you have to prophesy again now you're
[1:12:30] not bringing your own prophecy you're
[1:12:32] not bringing your own version of
[1:12:34] Prophecy you're bringing what's already
[1:12:37] been spoken by the seventh Church age
[1:12:39] messenger because even he is is bringing
[1:12:42] what the prophets have already
[1:12:45] revealed and so the the point is getting
[1:12:48] the
[1:12:49] word from the hand of the Angel which is
[1:12:53] Christ the son of man
[1:12:55] that's come down to reveal himself the
[1:12:58] Lord that has descended from heaven with
[1:13:00] the message it's not hyperbole he's come
[1:13:03] down in a different way today than he's
[1:13:06] ever been with the church because he's
[1:13:08] come in
[1:13:09] fullness All Through the Ages it was in
[1:13:12] part even in the first age the purpose
[1:13:14] was to bring the fullness to the bride
[1:13:16] but before they could get to it they
[1:13:18] fell
[1:13:19] away and so now then Ephesians 4 can
[1:13:23] truly and fully come into effect I want
[1:13:28] to look at the uh very uh
[1:13:31] commonly quoted uh portion of Christ is
[1:13:34] the mystery of God revealed again I
[1:13:37] believe connecting this together with
[1:13:40] the last two quotes I read is is very
[1:13:42] critical because then you begin to see
[1:13:44] further what the mystery of God is and
[1:13:47] and a further unfolding of the Oneness
[1:13:49] that I spoke about already all right we
[1:13:51] had the we were how much Oneness can we
[1:13:54] get in the seventh seal we've got we've
[1:13:57] got the incense which is the atonement
[1:13:59] of Christ coming together with the smoke
[1:14:01] of the prayers of the Saints then we got
[1:14:03] Christ coming down with an open book
[1:14:05] with with with the revealing of the word
[1:14:08] well what is the revealing of the word
[1:14:10] in the open book it's the revealing of
[1:14:13] Christ right and it's the means what is
[1:14:16] it supposed to do it's not just to stop
[1:14:18] at the seventh Church age messenger
[1:14:21] Angels descending to get it to you for
[1:14:23] you to eat it then you become one with
[1:14:26] the word then you can speak the word all
[1:14:29] right God's great mystery of how it's a
[1:14:32] secret he kept it a secret nobody knowed
[1:14:35] nothing about it even the angels didn't
[1:14:38] understand it see he didn't reveal it
[1:14:41] that's the reason under our seventh
[1:14:43] mystery when the seventh seal was opened
[1:14:45] there was
[1:14:47] silence why was there silence in heaven
[1:14:50] because it was a mystery was UN it was
[1:14:53] unknown amen
[1:14:57] Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted
[1:14:59] to know when he would come he said it's
[1:15:01] not even the son himself don't know when
[1:15:04] it's going to happen see God has this
[1:15:07] all to himself it's a secret and that's
[1:15:10] the reason there was silence in heaven
[1:15:12] for a space of half hour and seven
[1:15:15] Thunders utter their voices and John was
[1:15:17] even forbidden to write it see the
[1:15:19] coming of the Lord that's one thing he
[1:15:22] hasn't revealed yet how he will come
[1:15:25] when he will come it's a good thing he
[1:15:27] doesn't
[1:15:29] no the quote doesn't finish there he has
[1:15:33] showed or revealed it in every type
[1:15:36] that's in the
[1:15:39] Bible therefore the entire Bible is the
[1:15:41] revelation of God's mystery in Christ H
[1:15:45] the entire Bible is an expression of one
[1:15:47] goal that God had one purpose he wanted
[1:15:49] to achieve in the entire Bible and all
[1:15:51] the acts of the Believers in the Bible
[1:15:53] has been in type and expressing what
[1:15:55] God's Great goal is and now in this last
[1:15:59] day he has revealed it and shows it did
[1:16:03] you just hear what he said he said he's
[1:16:06] revealed it and showed what the coming
[1:16:08] of the Lord
[1:16:10] is and God's help we'll see it right
[1:16:13] here this morning What the Lord Has in
[1:16:16] his mind all along and has expressed it
[1:16:18] therefore you can see the great meaning
[1:16:21] of what it's been to know this and then
[1:16:24] to try to bring it to the people see and
[1:16:27] then you don't I haven't went into
[1:16:28] details to try to explain it as God has
[1:16:31] revealed it to me
[1:16:34] my so the title of the message is Christ
[1:16:40] is the mystery of God revealed where do
[1:16:42] we find the terminology the mystery of
[1:16:46] God in the Bible a few places but one in
[1:16:49] particular that we've just referred to
[1:16:52] Revelation 10:7 so the Myster of God
[1:16:55] should be finished so when we see that
[1:16:58] language should be finished it means
[1:17:00] that there's coming to be a completion
[1:17:03] right there's a revelation contained
[1:17:05] into that but really what the prophet's
[1:17:08] purpose is to do is to bring it to
[1:17:12] completion to bring it to a finishing
[1:17:15] work because remember the angel comes
[1:17:18] and says time shall be no more well it
[1:17:21] doesn't mean literally the end of time
[1:17:23] because even the millennium has time
[1:17:26] right but it says there will be no
[1:17:28] longer a delay a delay to what the
[1:17:31] mystery of God being finished because
[1:17:33] the mighty Angel has come down all right
[1:17:36] and remember brother I want to I want to
[1:17:37] hold my thought there brother brandom
[1:17:39] refers to Matthew
[1:17:41] 24 and he says this is talking about the
[1:17:44] coming of the Lord and that it's been
[1:17:46] it's revealed in every type in the Bible
[1:17:48] and
[1:17:49] that God has revealed it to us in this
[1:17:53] day so we find then that which was a
[1:17:57] secret the angels in heaven didn't even
[1:17:59] know is now being revealed so let's read
[1:18:03] it Matthew
[1:18:06] 24
[1:18:08] 42 uh
[1:18:11] 36 but of that day and hour knoweth no
[1:18:13] man no not the angels of heaven but my
[1:18:16] father only see it's a secret there's
[1:18:18] silence in heaven the space of half an
[1:18:22] hour right and John was forbidden to
[1:18:26] write don't write about it don't reveal
[1:18:28] what it
[1:18:29] is it's sealed up Daniel told us when is
[1:18:34] it it's sealed up until the time of the
[1:18:38] end we'll refer to that again in a few
[1:18:41] minutes but as the days of Noah were so
[1:18:44] shall also the coming of the son of man
[1:18:49] be so the coming of the son of man has
[1:18:52] been revealed and shown
[1:18:56] and every type in the Bible manifests it
[1:18:59] and we know it in this day
[1:19:01] so the coming of the son of man the
[1:19:04] seven Thunders are speaking and
[1:19:07] revealing that which was secret hidden
[1:19:10] to the angels even to the Sun the seven
[1:19:13] Thunders are
[1:19:15] revealing the revelation of the son of
[1:19:17] man the coming of the son of man this
[1:19:21] this word coming speaks of his personal
[1:19:25] presence his very presence he's he's
[1:19:28] what does the prophet say in the Rapture
[1:19:31] message the Lord himself shall descend
[1:19:34] from heaven with a shout the shout what
[1:19:37] is the shout it's the message going
[1:19:40] forth first the living bread of life
[1:19:43] bringing forth the bride so the Lord has
[1:19:46] already descended not a nail scar but in
[1:19:50] spirit
[1:19:51] form but then as then we go back to
[1:19:55] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:19:57] what does that sermon tell us because
[1:19:59] the world would say the you know the
[1:20:01] coming of the Lord is it's going to be a
[1:20:03] really loud
[1:20:04] noise you know and there's going to be
[1:20:07] an angel come out with a big trumpet and
[1:20:10] blow this trumpet and then the whole
[1:20:12] world will will be raptured you know
[1:20:15] like billions of people will be missing
[1:20:18] from the earth that's one interpretation
[1:20:21] of it you know and and this is the this
[1:20:24] is the way the world has it just like in
[1:20:26] the coming first coming of Christ they
[1:20:28] said okay here's what's going to happen
[1:20:30] there's going to be four Messianic
[1:20:32] figures first there's going to be Elijah
[1:20:35] then there's going to be The Godly high
[1:20:36] priest then there's going to be the
[1:20:38] Messiah son of Joseph he'll be killed
[1:20:41] then there'll be the Messiah the Son of
[1:20:42] David they had it all worked out and it
[1:20:44] was all wrong completely a million miles
[1:20:48] away from anything that they ever
[1:20:50] imagined ever ever anticipated and so
[1:20:53] has the church by their own
[1:20:55] interpretations been blinded to the
[1:20:58] revealing of the son of man in this day
[1:21:02] they've they they say you think that the
[1:21:04] mighty Angel has come down with an open
[1:21:06] book for you to eat and become one with
[1:21:09] him in this day you are literally in a
[1:21:11] cult in your you've lost your mind they
[1:21:14] said the same thing to the
[1:21:16] disciples look and see no Prophet has
[1:21:20] arisen from
[1:21:22] Nazareth they they're referring into
[1:21:24] scripture and they're literally
[1:21:29] blind and it's hidden from the wise and
[1:21:32] prudent and revealed to babes such as
[1:21:36] would learn and so as we see this and as
[1:21:40] we understand
[1:21:42] this then we can we can put it begin to
[1:21:45] put it together as the prophet did what
[1:21:47] is the
[1:21:49] three-fold purpose of
[1:21:51] God so every one of us should have this
[1:21:54] memorized if we don't let's get let's
[1:21:56] get going on
[1:21:57] that God
[1:21:59] revealed in fullness in Christ to
[1:22:02] accomplish
[1:22:04] Redemption to accomplish Calvary to shed
[1:22:07] the blood and to reveal God to us right
[1:22:10] what's the second
[1:22:12] part god revealed in fullness in the
[1:22:16] bride in order to restore
[1:22:19] pinenes what's the third Back to Eden so
[1:22:23] the this this is the purpose of
[1:22:25] redemption when we look at the mystery
[1:22:27] of God we understand then that this is
[1:22:31] applicable to his
[1:22:33] coming and to his purpose Through the
[1:22:36] Ages so what is his ultimate purpose
[1:22:39] Through the Ages it wasn't just to be
[1:22:42] revealed in a
[1:22:45] onebody Ministry a one person Ministry
[1:22:48] it's not just God revealed in Jesus
[1:22:51] Christ he wants to be revealed in a many
[1:22:54] membered body so it's God in Christ in
[1:22:58] the church all that God was he poured
[1:23:01] into Christ all that Christ was he
[1:23:02] poured into the he has poured into the
[1:23:04] church and so we can see he's descended
[1:23:07] in fullness with the complete restored
[1:23:10] word to take on a form see the the the
[1:23:15] trinitarian idea of of the godhead
[1:23:18] they're going back into eternity and
[1:23:20] trying to bring reasoning and logic and
[1:23:23] philosophy into it and it's totally
[1:23:25] missing the
[1:23:26] Revelation because it's God's per God is
[1:23:29] a spirit he's invisible but it's not
[1:23:32] God's purpose to stay in that form he
[1:23:35] wants to come into a form that we can
[1:23:37] understand who he is and he did that
[1:23:39] perfectly completely in Jesus Christ but
[1:23:42] the thing
[1:23:43] is every church every denomination stops
[1:23:48] right there and they have their own
[1:23:49] interpretation of that what's the second
[1:23:51] person of the godhead well it is it it's
[1:23:54] he's he's his own father see these
[1:23:57] interpretations are missing the
[1:24:00] revelation of the seventh seal because
[1:24:03] the revelation of the seventh seal is
[1:24:05] showing us now that actually the
[1:24:09] fullness of God is in the bride and even
[1:24:13] further beyond that we can see by that
[1:24:16] predestination isn't god making a random
[1:24:19] choice but it actually is his own seed
[1:24:23] that he had in himself and when you come
[1:24:26] forth It's your very life Jesus is that
[1:24:29] life in fullness manifested you in part
[1:24:33] but God's purpose is for that fullness
[1:24:37] and the part all the parts to come
[1:24:39] together in
[1:24:41] one under the opening of the seventh
[1:24:44] seal why do you think the devil has so
[1:24:47] attacked the seventh seal with so many
[1:24:49] false interpretations and
[1:24:51] misunderstandings and tried to say send
[1:24:53] the quot unquote Apostles and eighth
[1:24:56] Messengers to say you know it's not
[1:24:57] revealed you know it's for the future
[1:24:59] they're Miss they're saying oh look look
[1:25:03] what God did then look what God's going
[1:25:06] to do and they miss actually what he's
[1:25:09] doing
[1:25:12] now notice in Hebrews
[1:25:16] 3:7 the language of Paul wherefore as
[1:25:20] the Holy Ghost saith today if you will
[1:25:24] will hear his voice you know he has a
[1:25:27] voice
[1:25:30] today I hope you still love
[1:25:32] me but you realize that the voice is not
[1:25:35] limited to a tape certainly on a tape
[1:25:39] but if you just put it past tense on a
[1:25:41] tape you can become guilty of idolatry
[1:25:45] and Miss what Christ is doing today and
[1:25:48] you are listening to the tape and have
[1:25:51] it's a it's a hidden Mystery to you of
[1:25:54] what Christ is doing now in the bride
[1:25:57] because today he's speaking it's not
[1:25:59] enough to say I believe that there was a
[1:26:02] final messenger because the final
[1:26:04] messenger tells you that under the
[1:26:06] messenger the bride there will be a
[1:26:09] final voice to the final age and so you
[1:26:12] know the devil wants us to think you
[1:26:13] know look at all this these problems we
[1:26:16] have in the message and we have
[1:26:17] divisions and we have this God is
[1:26:19] working you you you're don't don't miss
[1:26:23] it the Holy Spirit has been revealing
[1:26:26] things and just as in the book of Acts
[1:26:29] we think see things raise up and we
[1:26:30] think oh man where's the unity and you
[1:26:32] watch the end result and God was working
[1:26:34] in the midst of all of that to bring his
[1:26:37] bride to maturity because maturity never
[1:26:40] happens in a vacuum in a place where
[1:26:43] there's not difficulties and trials you
[1:26:45] think oh my everything's going to be
[1:26:47] perfect and the bride will be in total
[1:26:49] Harmony yes they will with
[1:26:51] Christ and God will get us around to one
[1:26:54] another another but first we must be in
[1:26:55] Oneness with Christ The Living Word
[1:26:58] that's been manifested in this hour and
[1:27:00] they the problem becomes you can do two
[1:27:04] things you can either dismiss the words
[1:27:06] spoken by the prophet and say uh we have
[1:27:09] a new message today which many do or you
[1:27:12] can say oh my goodness this prophet's so
[1:27:15] amazing I love the prophet let's just
[1:27:18] listen to the prophet and do away with
[1:27:21] the LI the live voice because they've
[1:27:23] messed it all up
[1:27:24] they've made so many
[1:27:26] mistakes yes of we've all made mistakes
[1:27:30] this is the genius and the glory of God
[1:27:34] because we have this treasure in Earth
[1:27:36] and
[1:27:38] vessels and you know what God will raise
[1:27:41] up a minister and he'll preach something
[1:27:43] and it will agitate all the other
[1:27:44] ministers and they think first I must
[1:27:47] get a baseball bat after this brother
[1:27:49] but then if you're humble enough you'll
[1:27:52] realize God is speaking that's going to
[1:27:54] help you if you'll just humble down
[1:27:58] maybe the brother didn't have it all
[1:27:59] right there's probably a chance that
[1:28:01] that's true and there's a probably a
[1:28:03] chance that you don't have it all right
[1:28:05] too but God is working in a body
[1:28:08] Ministry to bring varieties of gifts
[1:28:12] through different types of preaching
[1:28:15] Ministries that's all for a
[1:28:17] purpose just wait upon the Lord before
[1:28:20] you attack a brother wait upon God
[1:28:23] because because maybe God's speaking
[1:28:25] through him something that's going to
[1:28:27] help you and to to to to bring you to a
[1:28:31] place where you can grow in him I I've
[1:28:34] seen it over the years I've been
[1:28:36] offended and frustrated with brothers
[1:28:38] and then I begin to study and I said
[1:28:40] this is the key that unlocks the mystery
[1:28:42] and I was mad at the
[1:28:47] guy because it becomes a a
[1:28:49] misunderstanding but but that is how God
[1:28:52] works we think he works in a he's a
[1:28:55] computer
[1:28:58] program God's not a computer and he
[1:29:00] never has worked like that none of his
[1:29:03] prophets were men of perfection outside
[1:29:05] of the Lord Jesus Christ all of them had
[1:29:08] a treasure in Earth and vessels we've
[1:29:10] talked about that when we preach on
[1:29:12] overcoming depression we almost could go
[1:29:14] through every minister in the word and
[1:29:16] and show you their mistakes and their
[1:29:18] errors and how they thought
[1:29:20] incorrectly and you say my goodness what
[1:29:23] is this guy trying to tear down your
[1:29:25] faith no that's how God brings the word
[1:29:29] then how do you think he brings the word
[1:29:32] now through ministers that have failings
[1:29:36] that have faults no I know there's also
[1:29:38] the devil has ministers I get that I
[1:29:41] understand that that's why we have to go
[1:29:43] back to the word and we hold one another
[1:29:45] accountable by the preaching of the word
[1:29:48] you take the message of the hour you
[1:29:50] listen to the word you pray over it you
[1:29:51] take it back to the Bible you preach it
[1:29:54] and you let the Revelation go forth to
[1:29:56] people's hearts and then it penetrates
[1:29:58] their hearts and works in him maybe
[1:29:59] agitates them and makes them mad at the
[1:30:01] preacher and then eventually they'll
[1:30:02] Search and say I was wrong and he was
[1:30:04] right or they'll say well he was wrong
[1:30:07] here and wrong there but we're walking
[1:30:09] in the
[1:30:10] word this is the Oneness it's not
[1:30:13] Oneness with a forced Oneness like
[1:30:17] Babylon Babylon forces Oneness external
[1:30:21] forces through the Great preacher
[1:30:24] through the great anointed one through
[1:30:26] the great this guy the eighth messenger
[1:30:28] the Apostle the one that's going to fix
[1:30:30] brother bram's all brother bram's
[1:30:31] mistakes the one that's going to
[1:30:33] whatever they're going to do that these
[1:30:35] men claim all these all this nonsense no
[1:30:40] it's going to be a
[1:30:41] revelation and it's going to be a body
[1:30:43] Ministry it's not going to be a oneman
[1:30:45] Ministry those that time is over with we
[1:30:48] have no scriptural precedence to say
[1:30:51] okay now after now that once the word is
[1:30:54] restored we got another one-man Ministry
[1:30:57] we understand when the word is restored
[1:30:59] that it becomes the five-fold ministry
[1:31:01] can now enter into the purpose that God
[1:31:05] has for that Ministry and it's a
[1:31:07] Ministry of what
[1:31:09] reconciliation he's given to us the word
[1:31:12] of reconciliation the word of
[1:31:14] reconciliation isn't just on a tape it's
[1:31:17] on a tape and it isn't just in the Bible
[1:31:19] but it must come from those sources
[1:31:22] through a spoken voice
[1:31:24] today if you hear his voice Harden not
[1:31:27] your hearts am the absolute is the Bible
[1:31:31] and absolute pointing to the the
[1:31:33] absolute and absolute preached by
[1:31:35] Brother brandham pointing to the
[1:31:37] absolute which is the Bible Jesus
[1:31:39] Christ and so our preaching is based
[1:31:42] upon this and every one of us we have to
[1:31:46] go back to the
[1:31:47] word and you have to check and say was
[1:31:49] that was what Brother JD said right I
[1:31:53] find that in the script because that's
[1:31:54] where growth is going to
[1:31:57] come and so we the ministry of the word
[1:32:01] praise you our literally the preaching
[1:32:03] of the word is to beg you in Christ's
[1:32:07] Place hey be reconciled to God come into
[1:32:11] Oneness with God what's the ministry of
[1:32:13] the word today come into Oneness with
[1:32:16] the fullness of the word in this hour
[1:32:19] amen and and again Romans 10 shows us
[1:32:24] how will they call on
[1:32:26] him if they have not believed and how
[1:32:29] shall they believe if they haven't heard
[1:32:31] and how will they hear without a
[1:32:33] preacher and how will they preach unless
[1:32:36] they're
[1:32:37] sent so you see this trickle down that H
[1:32:40] takes place when I look at Oneness it's
[1:32:44] it's not a it's not a it's it's it's not
[1:32:47] a a Oneness of equal
[1:32:49] rights right it's a Oneness of headship
[1:32:52] if you find in Christ is the mystery of
[1:32:55] God revealed brother brandham repeats
[1:32:57] over and over again about headship
[1:32:59] coming down headship being restored it's
[1:33:02] it's it's it's a it's a it's a dissent
[1:33:06] right and it's it's coming down through
[1:33:09] a ministry right 2 Corinthians 35 and 6
[1:33:15] Paul says not that we're sufficient of
[1:33:17] ourselves to think anything as of
[1:33:19] ourselves but our sufficiency is of god
[1:33:22] who's also made us able Ministers of the
[1:33:25] New Covenant not of the letter but of
[1:33:28] the spirit for the letter kills but the
[1:33:30] spirit gives life in the Old Testament
[1:33:33] the ministry of the letter could only
[1:33:36] bring death because no one can fulfill
[1:33:40] the letter of the law it kills you
[1:33:43] because you're born in sin shaped in
[1:33:45] iniquity you no one seeks God there's
[1:33:47] none that's
[1:33:49] good but the New Covenant comes and says
[1:33:53] I'll
[1:33:54] I'll not make a I'll not make the old
[1:33:56] Covenant I'll not rewarm that over but
[1:33:59] I'll make a new one for you the other
[1:34:01] one becomes obsolete what's the new one
[1:34:03] I'm going to take my spirit I'm going to
[1:34:05] put it inside you and I'm going to write
[1:34:07] my word in your heart and in your
[1:34:10] mind and so this actually is the
[1:34:14] ministry of the preaching of the
[1:34:17] word right when we when when a true
[1:34:21] god-sent minister is preaching the word
[1:34:24] and again I want to I want to point this
[1:34:28] out how is overseers ship of the church
[1:34:31] to come by feeding the flock of
[1:34:35] God not taking lordship over the flock
[1:34:40] it's not being the boss brother Bram
[1:34:42] says me and brother Neville are not
[1:34:45] bosses no it's the preaching of the word
[1:34:49] that feeds the bride that's where the
[1:34:52] overseers ship comes it's not in
[1:34:54] controlling your life telling you what
[1:34:56] car to buy and what vacation you can and
[1:34:58] can't go on it's to teach you how to
[1:35:01] know to follow the leadership of the
[1:35:03] Holy Ghost and it's to bring you to a
[1:35:06] place where you're equipped to do what
[1:35:09] you're supposed to do men are equipped
[1:35:12] then to lead their families not that the
[1:35:14] pastor enters into the family and leads
[1:35:16] the family but that equips the husband
[1:35:20] to be a leader in the
[1:35:22] home this is God 's purpose for the
[1:35:24] five-fold ministry it's for the
[1:35:27] equipping of the Saints All right so
[1:35:29] then uh verse 7 but if the ministration
[1:35:31] of death written and engraven in Stones
[1:35:34] was glorious so that the children of
[1:35:36] Israel could not steadfastly behold the
[1:35:38] face of Moses for the glory of his
[1:35:40] countenance which Glory was to be done
[1:35:42] away how shall not the ministration of
[1:35:45] the spirit be rather glorious for the
[1:35:48] ministration of the condemnation be
[1:35:50] glory much more does the ministration of
[1:35:53] righteous
[1:35:54] exceed in glory I want you to I want to
[1:35:56] I want to you can take that down now at
[1:35:59] the beginning of 2 Corinthians 3 what do
[1:36:01] Paul say I don't need a letter of
[1:36:04] recommendation from some group of
[1:36:06] ministers from Jerusalem actually you're
[1:36:10] my letter of recommendation because what
[1:36:13] I've preached to you has been written on
[1:36:16] your heart by the spirit now your life
[1:36:18] is manifesting my very letter of
[1:36:22] recommendation amen so when he says you
[1:36:24] are an epistle read and known of all men
[1:36:28] you're you're the written you're the
[1:36:30] preached word
[1:36:33] manifested right and so then when we
[1:36:35] come to this the the Min if the ministry
[1:36:38] of death under the Ten Commandments was
[1:36:43] glorious right so that the people they
[1:36:46] couldn't even look at Moses how much
[1:36:48] more glorious is the
[1:36:51] ministry of the spirit
[1:36:54] right the New Covenant is the ministry
[1:36:55] of the spirit and Paul puts
[1:36:59] himself directly in there the five-fold
[1:37:02] ministry as the Ministers of that new
[1:37:05] covenant in the spirit so then how
[1:37:08] necessary it is for the preaching of the
[1:37:10] word and what does he says we we we all
[1:37:14] as in a
[1:37:16] mirror
[1:37:18] behold what the glory of the Lord face
[1:37:22] to face right
[1:37:24] and we're changed in what from glory to
[1:37:27] glory so put it all together the
[1:37:30] ministry of the spirit through the
[1:37:32] preaching of the of uh of the seventh
[1:37:36] seal through the preaching of the
[1:37:38] opening of the word in this hour then
[1:37:41] what does it do it you're actually
[1:37:43] literally looking at the Lord Jesus
[1:37:45] Christ in the mirror
[1:37:48] Hallelujah and that that image then of
[1:37:52] the word is is changing you from glory
[1:37:56] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[1:37:59] Lord now that's what is saying when it
[1:38:02] says where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:38:04] there is Liberty it's not talking about
[1:38:06] a Pentecostal church it's talking about
[1:38:09] the ministry of the word going forth to
[1:38:12] your heart and bringing the transform
[1:38:14] transforming power so that you're
[1:38:16] literally looking at Jesus Christ and
[1:38:19] being changed into His
[1:38:20] Image amen if Ephesians
[1:38:25] 4 and we'll start at verse
[1:38:28] 8 wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[1:38:31] on high he led captivity captive and
[1:38:34] gave gifts unto men now that he ascended
[1:38:37] what is it but that he also descended
[1:38:40] first into the lower parts of the earth
[1:38:43] he that descended is the same also that
[1:38:45] ascended up far above all Heavens that
[1:38:48] he might fill all things and he gave
[1:38:52] some gave
[1:38:55] some wow
[1:38:58] so Jesus ascended and gave gifts to men
[1:39:04] so he ascended up right to intercede for
[1:39:08] the church right and we know we saw the
[1:39:12] seventh seal that intercession takes a
[1:39:15] different form takes a different
[1:39:18] shape you might be puzzled by that but
[1:39:21] it absolutely does because the the smoke
[1:39:23] of the incense now is rising up to
[1:39:26] become one with the prayers of the
[1:39:28] Saints and we find in Daniel chapter 12
[1:39:33] when the when when that
[1:39:36] mystery the sealed book becomes open
[1:39:39] when does it become open at the time of
[1:39:41] the end it says what does it say about
[1:39:43] the wise it says the wise will
[1:39:45] understand but what else does it say
[1:39:47] about the wise many will be
[1:39:50] purified and made wise
[1:39:54] say I thought that happened at Calvary
[1:39:56] the price was paid at Calvary but it had
[1:39:59] to come to the opening of the seventh
[1:40:02] seal where that atonement is made and
[1:40:06] that the the the fullness of what Christ
[1:40:09] paid for comes into the bride so that
[1:40:13] there's a Oneness but remember that this
[1:40:16] is a descending Oneness and it's a
[1:40:20] Oneness of headship and that headship
[1:40:23] ship is directly to the body but because
[1:40:28] every every one of the five-fold
[1:40:29] ministry it's a it's part of the body
[1:40:32] but remember the even the Apostle when
[1:40:34] he speaks of the gifts in the body he
[1:40:36] says he first firstly Apostles
[1:40:39] secondarily prophets thirdly teachers so
[1:40:43] we see that there's an order to the word
[1:40:46] again that doesn't make him Lords over
[1:40:47] God's Heritage but that makes them the
[1:40:51] means of fulfilling the purpose of the
[1:40:54] Ascension of Christ because the gifts
[1:40:57] it's we can call it Ascension gifts so
[1:41:00] he ascended up high and he gave gifts
[1:41:01] unto man what gifts did he give Apostles
[1:41:04] go back go to uh verse
[1:41:07] 11 he gave some Apostles some prophets
[1:41:11] some evangelists some pastors and
[1:41:14] teachers so his work of intercession for
[1:41:20] the
[1:41:20] church when it comes to the fullness of
[1:41:23] the word in the end time when the
[1:41:26] seventh seal is open his work of
[1:41:29] intercession then is what is it
[1:41:32] through it's through the five-fold
[1:41:36] ministry how the preaching of the word
[1:41:39] it's not you don't come to us for the
[1:41:41] Forgiveness of
[1:41:43] sins this is nonsense but at the same
[1:41:47] time you understand forgiveness of sins
[1:41:49] comes by the preaching of the word when
[1:41:52] you hear the word with faith Faith sins
[1:41:54] become forgiven the source is not the
[1:41:57] man the source is
[1:42:00] Christ so then we can understand here
[1:42:03] that the feeding the feeding of the
[1:42:05] flock then takes on a different shape
[1:42:08] and form when you realize that it's
[1:42:11] actually
[1:42:12] Christ the chief Shepherd who's feeding
[1:42:15] the flock and when we can understand it
[1:42:18] the that intercessory work and that and
[1:42:21] that Ministry of headship is not the
[1:42:26] man right because the purpose is not
[1:42:30] control the purpose is not personal
[1:42:34] lordship of the pastor or the Apostle or
[1:42:37] the prophet it's not personal lordship
[1:42:40] over you but it's feeding and then we'll
[1:42:43] look at what it says next verse 12 for
[1:42:47] the
[1:42:48] perfecting of the Saints I've said this
[1:42:51] many times per affecting is not the same
[1:42:55] word that we find in another place where
[1:42:57] it says uh
[1:43:01] in the next verse unto a perfect man
[1:43:05] perfect most places comes from the Greek
[1:43:08] word
[1:43:09] Tios this is a different word this word
[1:43:12] means the
[1:43:14] equipping of the
[1:43:16] Saints but when you understand that if
[1:43:19] you look at the word equipping it's used
[1:43:22] in milit milary jargon and so when when
[1:43:26] the people or the or the leader or the
[1:43:30] king would go to give the equipment
[1:43:35] to the military he gives their clothing
[1:43:39] their shoes their weapons their their
[1:43:43] defensive weapons all those things and
[1:43:45] so the purpose of the five-fold ministry
[1:43:49] then is to equip the Saints is to draag
[1:43:54] the Saints with the word so that the
[1:43:57] Saints then eat the
[1:44:00] book right and then they know what to do
[1:44:03] with with the book they prophesy again
[1:44:06] they take what's spoken and then they
[1:44:08] speak it all right and so you can
[1:44:11] understand then if we look if we look
[1:44:15] further and
[1:44:16] deeper we understand that men are to
[1:44:19] lead their
[1:44:21] homes God said I'll I'll reveal the
[1:44:24] Mysteries to Abraham I'll reveal my
[1:44:27] secrets to
[1:44:28] Abraham because I know he'll teach is
[1:44:31] and command his family after him right
[1:44:36] and so this is a essential thing you
[1:44:39] know fathers the Bible says that fathers
[1:44:42] must raise their
[1:44:45] children uh it says fathers provoke not
[1:44:49] your children to wrath but bring them up
[1:44:51] in the nurture and admonition of the
[1:44:53] Lord the word nurture literally means
[1:44:56] the teaching bring them up in the
[1:44:58] teaching or
[1:45:00] education and admonition speaks of
[1:45:04] direct application in action through
[1:45:06] discipline and rebuke so and of course
[1:45:09] we we spoke before mother is following
[1:45:12] the vision of the father so the man is
[1:45:15] the one that's charged with taking
[1:45:17] Dominion so the first order of dominion
[1:45:21] is the family and and so mother then is
[1:45:24] to come under the headship of her
[1:45:27] husband and so you see many of these
[1:45:30] churches become so perverted because the
[1:45:33] preacher and the five-fold ministry
[1:45:35] wants to come in between this
[1:45:37] process then what's ends up happening is
[1:45:40] the preacher then subverts the husband
[1:45:42] so then the husband flips places and
[1:45:44] he's led by his wife who's led by the
[1:45:47] pastor and it becomes a perversion of
[1:45:50] the word be because the man then then
[1:45:53] he's lost his authority and usually what
[1:45:55] happens is it splits up and the pastor
[1:45:57] has his
[1:46:01] herum and so what God's purpose is is to
[1:46:05] equip the men to
[1:46:07] teach and to admonish correct
[1:46:11] discipline their family and mother then
[1:46:15] enters into the vision because she's the
[1:46:17] helper of this vision and
[1:46:20] Mission and so when we can when we we go
[1:46:22] go back to Ephesians
[1:46:25] 4 we see then that the five-fold
[1:46:28] ministry is to equip the Saints for the
[1:46:31] work of the ministry so it's equipping
[1:46:34] father mother and also the children but
[1:46:37] we understand that the primary teacher
[1:46:40] of the home has to be the father you
[1:46:43] know I'm all in favor of youth ministry
[1:46:46] I'm all in favor of Sunday school I'm
[1:46:48] all in favor of Youth Camp but I'm not
[1:46:53] in favor of that in place of the father
[1:46:55] leading the home it would be better if
[1:46:58] we had none of all that other stuff and
[1:47:00] Father's leading the home then all of
[1:47:02] that without with Father saying the
[1:47:04] church takes care of my kids you you'll
[1:47:07] wind up in trouble I promise you that
[1:47:10] the primary influence of children are
[1:47:12] not to be their peer group it's Mom and
[1:47:16] Dad the primary teachers of the children
[1:47:19] must be dad with a vision and a Mission
[1:47:23] mom entering into that Mi vision and
[1:47:26] Mission and teaching the children all
[1:47:29] right for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:47:31] for the work of the ministry that's why
[1:47:33] I say the headship of Christ is Flowing
[1:47:36] down into the ministry of the word into
[1:47:39] the fathers into the mothers and into
[1:47:42] the
[1:47:44] children for the work of the ministry
[1:47:46] for the edifying or the building up of
[1:47:48] the body of
[1:47:49] Christ again this is a prophecy this is
[1:47:52] an end time prophecy this is the
[1:47:55] purpose the goal of what God is doing
[1:47:59] for the church and I promise you as they
[1:48:01] try to say in Jeffersonville God's not
[1:48:04] abandoning this
[1:48:06] purpose he's not saying you know what I
[1:48:08] messed up so I'm just going to give you
[1:48:09] tapes to listen
[1:48:11] to he said I'm giving you tapes but I'm
[1:48:14] sending the five-fold ministry to bring
[1:48:16] the Revelation because the prophet
[1:48:18] himself said I pray that these men that
[1:48:21] come after me will take what I said
[1:48:23] and make more sense to it that they
[1:48:25] could bring it to a place where it comes
[1:48:27] to
[1:48:28] life and so I don't believe the prophet
[1:48:31] was wrong when he said that because it's
[1:48:33] squarely right here in the scripture
[1:48:35] that we're reading it and God has spoken
[1:48:37] that he's going to do it and there's
[1:48:39] nothing that's going to stop what the
[1:48:41] word says
[1:48:43] here there's no amount of devils in hell
[1:48:46] and anointed false teachers that are
[1:48:48] going to come in and destroy the work of
[1:48:50] God that he's doing through the
[1:48:52] five-fold Ministry into the bride you
[1:48:55] see you see why the the the
[1:48:57] imbalance that the devil is trying to
[1:49:00] put on people and bring a confusion oh
[1:49:02] we have to go after tapes because the
[1:49:03] preachers are all messed
[1:49:06] up no no we got to get rid of the tapes
[1:49:09] because we just have anointed preachers
[1:49:12] to preach new things
[1:49:14] now it's you got to walk in the middle
[1:49:17] of the
[1:49:18] road the revealing of the word came
[1:49:20] through those tapes
[1:49:22] but they're not meant to stay there
[1:49:24] they're meant to be preached and the the
[1:49:26] the the the we are to Plum the depths of
[1:49:29] what has been spoken by taking it back
[1:49:32] to the word not bringing our own
[1:49:34] Revelation but bring bringing the
[1:49:36] Revelation that the Holy Spirit brings
[1:49:38] through the
[1:49:40] message so he he attacks the five-fold
[1:49:44] ministry he tries to he tries to turn
[1:49:46] them into Lords over God's Heritage on
[1:49:49] one hand and he he tries to say they're
[1:49:53] not necessary we have tapes on the other
[1:49:54] hand then he tries to say well the
[1:49:56] seventh seal I mean nobody can really
[1:49:59] understand it the guy that led me to the
[1:50:01] message that's the very thing he left
[1:50:03] the message for he said I couldn't
[1:50:05] understand what brother brandham said
[1:50:06] said in the seventh seal I don't even
[1:50:07] think brother brandham understood what
[1:50:09] he was trying to say about the seventh
[1:50:10] seal and I said well I don't I don't
[1:50:12] know about that I may not understand it
[1:50:15] but I believe that there's an
[1:50:16] understanding out there and I'm waiting
[1:50:19] on the Lord to help me with that amen
[1:50:22] and I think that's anything with brother
[1:50:24] brandham preaches just wait upon the
[1:50:26] Lord if you don't understand it he'll
[1:50:27] make it
[1:50:30] known so it's a prophecy of this
[1:50:33] five-fold ministry the headship of
[1:50:35] Christ the intercessory work of Christ
[1:50:38] by the washing of Water by the word amen
[1:50:44] so we're when when when they
[1:50:47] rejected the opening of the seventh seal
[1:50:50] think about it when they reject the
[1:50:52] opening of the seventh seal it goes from
[1:50:55] the old bloody lamb right to the word
[1:50:59] and the word only the prophet says so
[1:51:02] the application of the blood then is
[1:51:05] only in the revealing of those Seven
[1:51:09] Seals which is the message of the hour
[1:51:12] so the application of the atonement then
[1:51:14] we realize is coming by the preaching of
[1:51:18] the word it's the washing of Water by
[1:51:21] the word and this is the prophecy of
[1:51:24] that verse 13 says till we all come in
[1:51:27] the unity of the faith and of the
[1:51:29] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:51:33] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:51:36] stature of the fullness of Christ that's
[1:51:40] what's happening that's what you're
[1:51:43] experiencing in this hour if you're
[1:51:45] truly baptized with the Holy
[1:51:48] Ghost and walking in the revelation of
[1:51:51] the word this is what you're going
[1:51:53] through this is what God is doing you
[1:51:56] say what about stop stop do you believe
[1:51:59] the word or no perfect Faith takes the
[1:52:02] word beside regardless of the
[1:52:04] circumstance that he sees around him or
[1:52:07] what interpretation other people are
[1:52:09] bringing to the word around him he just
[1:52:12] sees the word and he says I'll stand by
[1:52:14] that God's doing that we're in the end
[1:52:16] time the seals have been open the
[1:52:19] five-fold ministry has been
[1:52:21] sent to preach the fullness of the
[1:52:24] word they have a treasure in Earth and
[1:52:26] vessels so do
[1:52:28] I God's doing this he's bringing me to
[1:52:32] the measure of the stature of the
[1:52:33] fullness of Christ that we henceforth be
[1:52:36] no more children toss to and fro and
[1:52:38] carried about with every wind of
[1:52:39] Doctrine by the slight of man and
[1:52:41] cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
[1:52:43] waight to deceive but speaking the truth
[1:52:46] in love may grow up into him in all
[1:52:48] things which is the head even Christ
[1:52:52] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[1:52:54] together and compacted that which every
[1:52:55] joint by that which every joint
[1:52:57] supplieth according to the effectual
[1:53:00] working in the measure of every part
[1:53:03] makes increase of the body unto that's a
[1:53:06] mouthful unto the edifying of itself in
[1:53:10] love so
[1:53:12] again this is the purpose of the
[1:53:14] five-fold ministry it's to equip you to
[1:53:18] come to the to a perfect man to the
[1:53:21] measure of the natural fullness of
[1:53:23] Christ you bring you to the place where
[1:53:25] all these doctrines are flowing out and
[1:53:28] you just
[1:53:31] say I know I I know the revelation of
[1:53:34] the word because it's living inside of
[1:53:36] me this one might say that this one
[1:53:38] might say that but I'm going to keep
[1:53:40] walking with God in the revelation of
[1:53:42] the word but then more than that he's
[1:53:44] got something for you to do because
[1:53:46] every single joint every single measure
[1:53:50] of the body must be there with the
[1:53:54] effectual working of the holy spirit in
[1:53:57] it to do what to increase the body so
[1:54:02] again that's why we say why is it a body
[1:54:04] Ministry why is he saying it's a body
[1:54:05] Ministry because the body is the purpose
[1:54:08] of the body is the edifying of itself in
[1:54:12] love so the five-fold ministry comes to
[1:54:14] bring the word and the end goal is
[1:54:17] perfect to full
[1:54:19] maturity full maturity of Christ
[1:54:23] so that we see that then Revelation
[1:54:26] 10:7 and 8- 11 come to full
[1:54:32] fruition in your life in your walk amen
[1:54:36] and then in that walk the body is
[1:54:39] growing and is being built up and and
[1:54:42] and and being strengthened
[1:54:45] amen all right I'm going to close there
[1:54:48] let's everybody gather forward and uh
[1:54:51] actually stay there
[1:54:53] let's have let's have I'm jumping the
[1:54:55] gun let's have the M our
[1:54:58] musicians come and minister to us and
[1:55:04] um then we'll sing a little bit and pray
[1:55:07] and then we'll bring you
[1:55:10] forward so as we as we understand and
[1:55:13] look at this headship flowing down it's
[1:55:17] a restoration of headship
[1:55:20] right so when when we see the
[1:55:22] restoration of headship it's the
[1:55:24] restoration of the word and
[1:55:34] coming why do you why do you think
[1:55:37] everybody's got their own interpretation
[1:55:38] of the channel That the word is going to
[1:55:40] come through and everybody's arguing and
[1:55:42] fighting and we have this great movement
[1:55:45] going around the world saying no no we
[1:55:46] got to we got our own channel we don't
[1:55:48] want the we don't want the Bible Channel
[1:55:51] we want our own own process we are on
[1:55:54] our own place and it's trying to bring a
[1:55:56] forced Unity of everybody around the
[1:56:00] world and it's trying to resurrect
[1:56:03] Babylon all over
[1:56:05] again and then to go with that there's a
[1:56:08] misunderstanding of the very thing
