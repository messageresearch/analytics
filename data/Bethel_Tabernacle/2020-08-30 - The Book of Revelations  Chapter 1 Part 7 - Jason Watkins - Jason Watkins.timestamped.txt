[3:15] hey man good morning
[3:16] god bless you all greet you in the name
[3:18] of the lord we want to get right into
[3:20] our lesson this morning
[3:22] amen i'm going to need somebody to speed
[3:24] that clock up because it is
[3:25] way slow but um i know it's time for me
[3:28] to get rolling here
[3:30] so we're continuing uh in our series on
[3:34] the book of revelation we want to go
[3:36] through it
[3:37] um verse by verse however we announced
[3:40] last time
[3:41] that we're not going to do as exhaustive
[3:43] a breakdown as we had been doing
[3:46] we are going to save that exhaustive
[3:47] breakdown for podcasts that we're
[3:50] gearing up for now and i've actually
[3:53] already been covering the material
[3:55] on the daily uh bible study call-in
[3:58] that i'm a part of amen been teaching it
[4:01] there for some number of months now
[4:03] so we've got good material laid out
[4:05] we're going to start covering that
[4:07] in our new podcast we'll be making
[4:09] announcements about that
[4:13] soon enough so we're going to um
[4:16] take more of a overview but we still
[4:19] want to look at it verse by verse
[4:22] just not spend a great deal of time on
[4:25] each verse and then you'll still be able
[4:28] to get
[4:29] uh the the the full teaching of it
[4:32] with the podcast show all right
[4:36] so the revelation i just want to look at
[4:37] these verses as we go down them
[4:40] so we have they started out with the
[4:42] revelation of jesus christ
[4:44] which god gave unto him to show unto his
[4:47] servants things which must
[4:49] shortly come to pass now what i'm going
[4:50] to do today is i'm going to just go
[4:53] over verses 1 2 three four
[4:56] five six seven and eight and i think if
[4:59] i can get to
[5:00] eight um then we will have a that'll be
[5:03] within our time limits for today
[5:06] and you'll understand better uh how i'm
[5:09] doing this so
[5:10] if you if you hear me repeating some
[5:12] things that are in previous lessons it's
[5:14] only because
[5:15] that midstream i'm adopting a new way of
[5:18] going about it so
[5:19] i just want to make sure we all stay
[5:21] caught up and on the same page
[5:23] so we found that in our very first verse
[5:25] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[5:27] gave unto him
[5:28] to show unto his servants things which
[5:31] must shortly come to pass
[5:33] and he sent and signified it by his
[5:36] angel unto his servant john we found
[5:39] here a number of things in our previous
[5:41] studies
[5:42] how that jesus christ which
[5:45] pre jesus christ predated the the man
[5:49] born of mary he was the logos as john
[5:51] said he was with god
[5:53] in fact was god all things were made by
[5:56] jesus christ
[5:57] according to john's gospel and according
[5:59] to matthew's
[6:00] epistle to the ephesian church there's
[6:03] not anything that was made that was not
[6:05] made
[6:06] by god in christ in the form of the
[6:09] logos the pillar of fire
[6:11] so we realized then that that pillar of
[6:13] fire came down
[6:15] and anointed an earthly man born of a
[6:18] woman but
[6:19] virgin born by the spoken word of god so
[6:22] that he could be
[6:23] a tabernacle for god to dwell in and
[6:26] god plainly says that this is my beloved
[6:28] son
[6:29] in whom i'm pleased to dwell in and so
[6:32] he goes
[6:33] forth and he has a wonderful ministry
[6:36] but we realize by the teaching of the
[6:37] scripture
[6:38] that jesus did not complete uh
[6:42] all of the things to be completed by
[6:45] christ and
[6:46] being god and flesh he
[6:49] he completed the part of purchasing
[6:52] at calvary but we realized that when he
[6:55] left the earth
[6:57] he left a measure of suffering for his
[6:59] bride he left
[7:00] a further fulfillment for his bride
[7:04] and this is what revelation chapter 1
[7:07] verse 1
[7:08] is referring to that this is a
[7:10] revelation of jesus christ
[7:12] in other words it is the ministry of
[7:14] christ now
[7:16] in the church because he's about to
[7:17] address a letter
[7:19] to seven churches john is going to turn
[7:22] and see him standing in the midst of
[7:23] seven
[7:24] lamp stands or seven golden candle
[7:26] sticks
[7:27] and we find that you have all of the
[7:29] imagery around you have the
[7:32] the seven lamp stands you have seven
[7:34] stars you have
[7:35] seven spirits seven lamp stands before
[7:38] the throne
[7:39] seven eyes seven horns all of these
[7:41] various
[7:42] uh points of imagery and they all
[7:45] reflect the work of that same jesus that
[7:49] created the world
[7:50] that same jesus that worked through the
[7:52] old testament prophets
[7:54] that same jesus that lived in the
[7:56] nazarene
[7:57] that and he was completely god he was
[7:59] the god-man
[8:00] and then uh we find that he being a
[8:03] prototype
[8:04] of a of a new kingdom of a coming
[8:07] kingdom
[8:08] that once again his life the life of
[8:10] christ would live
[8:12] in a again in a body of flesh
[8:15] in the world and so this is what the
[8:18] book of revelation
[8:19] is given for for the church to
[8:21] understand her position
[8:24] in context to what in in in position to
[8:28] according to what
[8:28] jesus lived on earth he's now living
[8:31] that
[8:32] in his bride he sent and signified it by
[8:35] his angel
[8:36] these are things that must shortly come
[8:38] to pass so
[8:39] shortly he's going to live out through
[8:41] seven ages
[8:42] at the end time he's going to bring
[8:44] forth an angel
[8:46] he's a signifying angel that is going to
[8:48] show
[8:49] john the day of the lord and is going to
[8:52] explain to john
[8:53] and walk with john through a two-year
[8:56] vision
[8:56] unrolling vision and how that you're
[9:00] going to find that god
[9:01] is going to bookend the first age and
[9:04] the last age
[9:05] with prophet messengers all right and
[9:08] then verse 2 carries right in with the
[9:10] same theme
[9:11] speaking of john who bear record of the
[9:13] word of god
[9:15] and the testimony of jesus christ so
[9:17] john
[9:18] representing the bride in her life is
[9:21] going to
[9:22] bear a testimony and what's that
[9:23] testimony going to be
[9:25] it's going to be a record of the life of
[9:28] god not just
[9:29] the historical record of his ministry in
[9:32] the gospels
[9:33] but his continuing work the bride with
[9:36] christ living
[9:37] in her is going to go through seven ages
[9:40] and she's going to be a
[9:41] living testimony her life is going to
[9:44] bear
[9:45] record of jesus christ and of the things
[9:47] that he saw so the things that he saw
[9:50] he's seeing future events he's called up
[9:52] to the lord's day
[9:53] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[9:56] hear the words of this prophecy verse 3
[9:59] and keep those things which are written
[10:01] therein for the time is at hand
[10:03] this is an interesting word blessed we
[10:06] find
[10:07] that that it one of the things that it
[10:09] does not mean
[10:10] is it does not mean fortunate that's a
[10:13] that's a
[10:14] shallow rendering of this word blessed
[10:16] that you
[10:17] you'll find that when the angel came to
[10:20] mary
[10:21] and he said unto her blessed art thou
[10:24] among women
[10:25] uh jesus said to peter blessed art thou
[10:28] simon because simon was able
[10:30] to identify the word simon caught a
[10:33] revelation
[10:34] even prior to his full conversion he was
[10:37] believing on christ
[10:38] but the holy ghost hadn't yet been given
[10:40] but yet he had a gene of god
[10:42] that could recognize who jesus was when
[10:45] the rest of the theological world
[10:46] had a misunderstanding of who he was as
[10:49] it was then
[10:50] so is it today and so this term blessed
[10:53] we realize
[10:54] it means that those people who are able
[10:57] to receive
[10:59] the revelation of their hour blessed are
[11:02] you
[11:02] for your eyes see and your ears hear
[11:05] blessed art thou
[11:06] mary above other women why because mary
[11:10] was able to say amen to every word of
[11:13] god
[11:14] mary was able to say be it unto me she
[11:17] heard a prophecy that sounded impossible
[11:21] and by every by every measurable metric
[11:25] was impossible there's nothing in nature
[11:27] nothing
[11:28] in science nothing to suggest that a
[11:31] human being can be born
[11:33] can be born by a complete virgin
[11:36] conception
[11:37] where there is neither male seed
[11:40] provided
[11:40] nor the female egg provided the only
[11:43] thing god needed was a
[11:45] was an incubation place and that was in
[11:48] the body of a woman
[11:49] because a woman calls the fall in
[11:51] genesis she's going to be given the
[11:53] grand privilege to restore it back
[11:55] you are the bride of jesus christ we are
[11:58] receiving the word
[12:00] he's indicating that the people who are
[12:02] going to catch the revelation of jesus
[12:04] christ
[12:05] from verse 1 who are going to be a
[12:08] living testimony of that record in verse
[12:10] 2
[12:11] are blessed of god because you have an
[12:14] ability
[12:15] you have an ability to hear the word see
[12:17] it hear it
[12:18] recognize it and act upon it because
[12:21] your whole life becomes an
[12:23] amen to every word verse 4 john to the
[12:26] seven churches which are
[12:28] in asia grace be unto you and peace from
[12:30] him
[12:31] which is and which was and which is to
[12:33] come and from the seven
[12:35] spirits which are before his throne a
[12:37] very in-depth
[12:38] verse here so you're going to notice
[12:41] that he's not
[12:42] writing to the church in jerusalem
[12:45] these are churches in asia so these are
[12:48] this is
[12:48] indicative of the fact that the gospel
[12:51] is going to go
[12:52] into all the world and jesus said when
[12:54] it goes into all the world it's going to
[12:56] pick up a gentile family and go around
[12:58] the world
[12:59] through seven continuous and contiguous
[13:02] and overlapping ages and it's going to
[13:05] find god's bride
[13:06] in every corner of the world in every
[13:08] age that she
[13:10] lives in and so we realize then that
[13:13] from him which is and which was and
[13:15] which is to come
[13:17] and from the seven spirits which are
[13:19] before his throne
[13:21] we realize that it's a capital s spirits
[13:23] it's not
[13:25] it's so it's speaking definitely of god
[13:27] but it's not saying that god is seven
[13:29] persons it's not that there's seven holy
[13:32] spirits
[13:32] and so you realize then that it's god in
[13:35] a form
[13:36] it's god unveiling himself in seven
[13:39] messengers
[13:40] he called them seven stars and he told
[13:42] john
[13:43] the interpretation of the stars in his
[13:46] right hand
[13:47] and the seven lamp stands and so it
[13:49] becomes very clear to us
[13:51] that he's going to manifest himself
[13:54] through seven ages
[13:55] by seven messengers that are going to
[13:57] gather seven ages of people
[13:59] and it's from him which was and
[14:02] is and is to come so in every age
[14:06] the true church is going to be
[14:07] identified because
[14:09] as christ she will be the same yesterday
[14:12] and forever
[14:12] the bride is always the bride the holy
[14:15] ghost produces
[14:16] a bride of christ in every age limited
[14:20] understanding as she had
[14:21] she was always the image of god in the
[14:24] earth
[14:25] and you could identify her in each age
[14:28] because she displayed the
[14:30] characteristics in all seven ages
[14:32] the seven spirits of god god moving
[14:36] seven times through seven messengers
[14:38] through seven ages
[14:39] to catch seven groups of people through
[14:41] two thousand years
[14:42] and jesus christ was the same yesterday
[14:45] today
[14:46] and in future days to come verse 5
[14:49] and from jesus christ who is the
[14:51] faithful
[14:52] witness and the first begotten of the
[14:55] dead
[14:56] and the prince of the kings of the earth
[14:59] unto him that loved us
[15:01] and washed us from our sins in his own
[15:03] blood
[15:04] now you'll find here in verse 5
[15:07] it calls him a faithful witness the only
[15:09] time in the bible you have these two
[15:11] terms put together
[15:12] faithful witness the next time you see
[15:15] it
[15:16] here you're seeing it in the first age
[15:18] now you don't see it again
[15:20] until the last stage revelation chapter
[15:22] 3
[15:23] picks it up in the laodicean age that
[15:26] now he's called you're going to notice
[15:28] the faithful and there's a new word and
[15:30] true witness
[15:31] because we realize that the last aids
[15:34] bride
[15:35] is going to be a demonstration that
[15:38] every movement he made in all seven ages
[15:42] is true and so the the faithful witness
[15:46] is now the faithful and true witness
[15:48] because in
[15:49] seven ages the seven spirits of god
[15:52] have taken the revelation of jesus
[15:54] christ to the church
[15:56] and she's become the living embodiment
[15:59] of the word
[16:00] and she's at the end time she's a
[16:02] faithful
[16:03] and true witness now you find that that
[16:06] goes along exactly again
[16:08] she's called that again in chapter 17
[16:11] because the bible speaks of her and i
[16:13] don't have time to turn to with all
[16:14] these scriptures
[16:15] this morning but if you go into chapter
[16:17] 17 you'll find
[16:19] that the bride of jesus christ ends up
[16:22] at the end time
[16:23] faithful now that corresponds perfectly
[16:27] to revelation one and five
[16:30] revelation 3 14 it picks up again
[16:33] in chapter 17 and then when you've and
[16:36] then when you
[16:36] find it comes again the next time
[16:39] it's in revelation 19 because now
[16:43] he christ rides out on the white horse
[16:46] and he's called
[16:47] the word of god and he's and he he has
[16:51] earned the title
[16:52] faithful and true and so we realize
[16:56] now that he let let's let's i'm gonna
[16:58] i'm gonna turn to that one real quick
[17:00] because i wanna i don't wanna i don't
[17:01] wanna miss this all right i might catch
[17:03] 17.
[17:05] um no we don't we're not going to have
[17:08] time i'm not because i'd have to read
[17:09] too much of it
[17:10] but we look at 19 and after these things
[17:12] i heard a great voice
[17:14] of much people in heaven saying alleluia
[17:16] salvation and glory and honor and power
[17:18] unto the lord god we come down to verse
[17:21] 11
[17:21] and i saw heaven open and behold a white
[17:23] horse and he that sat on him
[17:25] was called faithful and true all right
[17:28] now he's called a faithful witness
[17:30] in chapter one he's called faithful and
[17:33] true
[17:34] witness in chapter three in chapter 17
[17:38] we find the exact same language
[17:39] referring to his bride
[17:42] that she's also faithful she's a
[17:44] faithful witness
[17:45] but you notice here this is why that
[17:48] jesus there's two things you're seeing
[17:49] in chapter 19
[17:50] first that that he that he doesn't
[17:54] have the word witness it just simply
[17:56] says faithful and true
[17:58] because the time of him needing a
[18:00] witness in the earth is over the bride's
[18:02] already been taken
[18:03] she's already been raptured and when he
[18:05] comes out the
[18:06] the people of the earth wail because of
[18:09] him
[18:09] because they can see they thought they
[18:12] were in his family
[18:13] they realized they're not when they see
[18:15] his family following him on white horses
[18:18] and he's he's he he's not a witness
[18:21] anymore
[18:21] because the time of the witness is over
[18:24] he
[18:24] the bible just simply says he's called
[18:27] faithful
[18:28] and true and look at all of these
[18:31] badges and medals and ribbons of honor
[18:34] he's called faithful and true and the
[18:37] bible goes on down and he was
[18:39] clothed with a vesture dipped in blood
[18:41] and his his
[18:42] name is called the word of god the
[18:43] armies of heaven follow him out of his
[18:45] mouth go with the sharp sword
[18:47] verse 16 and he had on his vesture and
[18:50] on his thigh a name written king of
[18:51] kings
[18:52] and lord of lords you know something
[18:54] that's amazing that you can go and you
[18:56] can there's clips of it today
[18:58] where you have men who never served in
[19:01] the military never picked up a gun
[19:03] never fired a shot never got shot at
[19:05] were never in the military
[19:07] and they will dress up in military
[19:09] garments
[19:10] and put on a big salad bowl right over
[19:12] here of ribbons and metals and they'll
[19:14] have insignias and badges and eagles and
[19:16] lightning strikes
[19:17] and everything and they go in public
[19:19] impersonating men of honor
[19:21] and they never served like that but they
[19:23] want that notoriety
[19:25] and it works fine to the unknowing
[19:27] public until a real military man sees
[19:29] him
[19:30] and a real military man knows there's
[19:31] something not right about this guy
[19:34] and he starts to question him where were
[19:35] you stationed when was this
[19:37] what was the name what did you have what
[19:38] unit where and because the guy
[19:40] immediately can't answer all those
[19:41] questions
[19:42] they denounce him and expose him as a
[19:45] fraud
[19:46] because why is he a fraud because he's
[19:48] wearing insignias he hasn't earned
[19:50] he's wearing a uniform and medals and
[19:52] ribbons and names and titles he hasn't
[19:54] earned
[19:54] but in revelation 19 jesus can wear all
[19:57] of these
[19:58] insignias he can wear the mighty god he
[20:01] can wear
[20:02] the faithful and true he can wear a king
[20:04] of kings and lord of lords he can wear
[20:06] why can he wear it
[20:08] because in chapter 17 a bride
[20:11] was found faithful and he said she would
[20:14] in chapter one
[20:15] he proved it in chapter three he
[20:17] solidified it in chapter 17
[20:19] and when he comes writing out in verse
[20:21] in chapter 19 friends
[20:22] i'm here to tell you you're looking at
[20:24] one worthy to wear these titles
[20:26] and insignias amen so then all right
[20:29] let's keep moving we're going to we're
[20:30] going to run out of time here i'm just
[20:31] trying to go as quick as i can
[20:34] so then we come back verse verse six and
[20:37] hath
[20:37] made us kings i love this
[20:40] see he finishes that in verse five he's
[20:43] the first begotten of the dead
[20:45] the prince of the kings of the earth and
[20:48] uh and unto him that loved us and washes
[20:51] from our sins in his own blood verse six
[20:53] and hath made us kings and priests unto
[20:56] god
[20:56] and his father to him be glory and
[20:58] dominion forever and ever now
[21:00] you realize that uh there's two things
[21:02] here a king and a priest
[21:03] this is what he's making his family into
[21:05] how's he doing it
[21:06] by the revelation of verse one because
[21:09] the bride is seen in verse two
[21:11] and she's living out a witness and she's
[21:14] blessed because she can say amen to
[21:16] every word in verse three
[21:17] and john is literally writing to her and
[21:20] seven spirits are gonna be sent to her
[21:22] and we come to jesus christ who produces
[21:25] who is a faithful witness he produces a
[21:28] people who are faithful and true
[21:30] witness and in verse 6 he literally
[21:32] makes us kings
[21:33] kings mean dominion kings mean that you
[21:36] have power you have authority
[21:38] over the flesh over the devil over sin
[21:41] and over the world now sometimes we
[21:44] don't always
[21:45] feel like we have say man if i got all
[21:47] this authority
[21:48] i don't i sometimes brother i'm being
[21:50] honest brother jason i don't always feel
[21:52] like that i've got that authority
[21:54] and if i do i don't always get to
[21:56] exercise it well let me tell you the
[21:57] good news is
[21:58] you're also a priest and the thing about
[22:00] a priest is he has access to god
[22:04] and so how do you get your kingly
[22:06] authority how do you get that to work
[22:07] how do you become an overcomer
[22:09] because you're also a priest by the holy
[22:11] ghost and that gives you direct access
[22:13] to god
[22:14] who you can approach who can empower you
[22:17] because the bible
[22:18] teaches us he's the same yesterday and
[22:21] today
[22:22] and forever from him which was and which
[22:25] is
[22:25] and which is to come and behold verse 7
[22:29] he cometh with clouds and every eye
[22:31] shall see him
[22:32] and they also which pierced him and all
[22:34] the kindreds of
[22:36] the earth shall wail not rejoice
[22:40] you go into denominational churches
[22:42] today
[22:43] and if they're preaching on the rapture
[22:45] of the church
[22:46] you're going to get the escalator
[22:48] version
[22:49] you're not going to get the true version
[22:51] you're going to get the escalator
[22:52] version what i call the escalator
[22:54] version
[22:54] where they believe that the rapture of
[22:56] god's family is someday gabriel is going
[22:59] to step
[22:59] out on a cloud blow a golden trumpet a
[23:01] great celestial
[23:03] you know ethereal escalator is going to
[23:05] drop down from heaven
[23:07] jesus is going to come down like donald
[23:09] trump and tell the whole world
[23:11] you're saved and we're all going home
[23:13] and he's going to take everybody home
[23:15] that's that's an escalator version
[23:16] that's a modern interpretation that's
[23:18] not true
[23:19] that's not going to happen the bible
[23:21] says that when they see him coming
[23:24] in revelation 19 which is what this is
[23:26] referring to
[23:27] they will wail because of him
[23:30] it won't be a happy appearing because
[23:33] they
[23:33] they thought they were the family of god
[23:36] up until the moment they realize they're
[23:38] not
[23:39] because the family of god is following
[23:41] the lord
[23:42] on white horses and so he cometh with
[23:45] clouds this is not
[23:47] first if you take first thessalonians 4
[23:49] 16
[23:50] down through first thessalonians 5
[23:53] chapter
[23:53] chapter 5 verse 2 you'll find that jesus
[23:56] when he comes in a shout voice in a
[23:58] trumpet in verse 2 of chapter 5 he
[24:01] refers to it
[24:02] as a thief in the night now that's
[24:04] exactly what jesus said
[24:06] referring to a thief cometh in the night
[24:09] all right so we find that the
[24:11] this is not verse 7 is not the rapture
[24:14] of the church
[24:15] because the rapture of the church is
[24:17] recorded as a thief in the night
[24:19] in 1st thessalonians 5 2. this is one
[24:22] that every eye sees him this is
[24:23] revelation 19
[24:25] where we read a few minutes ago and they
[24:27] that and they which
[24:28] pierced him now you've got a double
[24:30] meaning natural and spiritual
[24:32] because the 144 000 are going to
[24:34] recognize him that's what
[24:36] zechariah 12 deals with zechariah 12 and
[24:39] 13
[24:40] that they shall look upon him whom they
[24:42] pierced and they shall even ask him
[24:44] where did you get these scars
[24:46] and he's going to say in the house of my
[24:47] friends and the bible says
[24:49] that the house of david will separate
[24:52] husbands from wives in the house of levi
[24:54] in the house of shimaya and all of these
[24:56] various places and they're going to
[24:58] lament and mourn like someone who's lost
[25:01] a firstborn child
[25:02] and so we realized that they were going
[25:04] to realize they pierced him
[25:06] but his message is going to be to them
[25:08] like joseph
[25:09] back in genesis he's going to say listen
[25:12] my brethren
[25:13] god did that don't be angry with
[25:15] yourselves somebody had to slaughter the
[25:18] lamb
[25:18] god blinded you you were his family you
[25:21] were the ones who could take it and he
[25:22] knew it
[25:23] so he blinded you allowed you to kill
[25:25] the lamb because somebody had to kill
[25:27] the lamb
[25:28] i had to be sacrificed and so joseph's
[25:31] message is
[25:32] be happy rejoice eat your food you're my
[25:35] brethren
[25:36] i'm going to take care of you from here
[25:38] on oh friends what a day paul said
[25:40] if the casting away of them be glorious
[25:43] how much more shall
[25:44] oh in that day when those jews are
[25:46] reunited back to christ
[25:48] what a day that's going to be but also
[25:51] in the spiritual side
[25:52] the people wail not only the jews
[25:55] because of a
[25:56] of a literal crucifixion but the but the
[26:00] gentiles because of a spiritual
[26:02] crucifixion
[26:03] and a prophet that seventh spirit that
[26:06] angel that seventh star with the seven
[26:08] spirit of christ upon him
[26:10] said and stood in this day and said i
[26:12] indict this
[26:13] generation for the second crucifixion of
[26:16] christ
[26:16] and i do so in the presence of the judge
[26:19] and so the whole world is weeping and
[26:22] wailing because they will see him who
[26:25] they pierced
[26:26] and he says in verse 8 finally i am
[26:29] alpha
[26:29] and omega the beginning and the ending
[26:32] saith the lord
[26:33] here it is which is and which was and
[26:35] which is to come
[26:37] the almighty understand this friends
[26:39] that from
[26:40] the first church age to the last church
[26:43] age he's been almighty
[26:45] from where we are now unto a body change
[26:48] i will promise you you can count on
[26:50] several things he'll be like he always
[26:52] was
[26:52] if that's how he'll be and that's how he
[26:54] will be
[26:55] the same yesterday today and forever how
[26:58] he was then is how he'll be
[27:00] now and how you can count on him to be
[27:02] tomorrow
