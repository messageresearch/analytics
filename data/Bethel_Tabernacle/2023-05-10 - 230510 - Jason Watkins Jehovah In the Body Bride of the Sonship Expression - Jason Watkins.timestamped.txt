[29:10] greet you
[29:11] all sufficient name of the Lord and I
[29:14] just want to say uh before I dive into
[29:16] uh sermon tonight
[29:19] um
[29:19] how much we enjoyed um
[29:22] the weekend we were able to stream and
[29:24] catch the Sunday school class and we've
[29:27] been in a good portion at least the
[29:29] first probably the first quarter of
[29:31] brother Don's sermon and then we had
[29:33] family Affairs to deal with and so today
[29:36] I have just been rejoicing around the
[29:38] word that Brother Don brought Sunday I
[29:41] thought it was fantastic amen and I it
[29:45] it probably strikes me that way
[29:47] particularly not only because of its
[29:49] content but because it's so conducive to
[29:51] the burden on my own heart amen for the
[29:54] word so have you come hungry tonight
[29:56] amen praise the Lord I want to thank you
[29:59] very deeply from the bottom of my heart
[30:02] on behalf of the entire tester family my
[30:05] wife's family
[30:07] gratitude and thanks for all the prayers
[30:09] the support the wonderful comments and
[30:13] uh my it's good to know in times like
[30:15] that that you have real family and
[30:17] friends amen that you know are upholding
[30:19] you
[30:20] and love and in prayer and so everything
[30:23] went well we were up there for an
[30:25] extended time and I was just testifying
[30:28] to some of the brothers today how that
[30:30] the Lord
[30:31] just was so very kind and we and sister
[30:34] Debbie actually had about almost a half
[30:36] dozen I think five or so
[30:39] very specific special request that she
[30:42] was asking the Lord as a special favor
[30:44] and wouldn't you know it one two three
[30:48] four and it was just just a beautiful
[30:50] thing to watch the Lord doing it and so
[30:52] amen and just prayer for that whole
[30:54] family in prayer for my wife and I we
[30:57] came back
[30:58] um extremely exhausted even sister
[31:01] Debbie wasn't able to make it here
[31:03] tonight just um very very exhausting
[31:06] because um
[31:07] not only the 10 days away but just the
[31:10] whole pressure of the organizing
[31:12] everything it all fell
[31:14] me and but the Lord came on the scene we
[31:17] had a wonderful wonderful
[31:19] memorial service for sister Linda and it
[31:22] was everything special that I'd hoped it
[31:24] would be she was certainly a very
[31:26] special person in my life
[31:28] amen and so it was a great privilege and
[31:30] great thrill for me amen I've known her
[31:33] since I was 15 and she's been uh she's
[31:36] been a gallant Warrior of the Cross you
[31:39] say you're talking like in the present
[31:41] tense like she's still alive yeah
[31:43] of course
[31:45] absolutely amen she has and remains a
[31:50] gallant Warrior of the Cross amen God
[31:53] bless you this evening we're going to
[31:55] turn to Romans chapter 12 and you'll
[31:59] recognize that amen if you were paying
[32:02] attention Sunday brother Don picked that
[32:03] up right there and we had a little bit
[32:05] of a Jubilee today amen he and I and
[32:08] brother Jason got a chance to meet and I
[32:11] was just testifying to him you know how
[32:13] much that meant to me because it's so
[32:16] close to my own thought tonight amen
[32:19] praise the Lord
[32:22] in Romans 12. we'll we'll catch verses
[32:26] one and two
[32:28] again
[32:29] Paul speaking here
[32:31] I beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[32:35] mercies of God
[32:36] that you present your bodies a Living
[32:39] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[32:44] is your reasonable service the Bible
[32:47] knowledge commentary calls the people
[32:51] who've actually follow Paul's
[32:53] instructions here believer priests
[32:57] that's a fantastic statement how many
[32:59] want to be a believer priest tonight to
[33:02] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[33:06] not something dead not something
[33:08] historic but alive something present
[33:11] tense your everyday life all right well
[33:13] I don't want to get sidetracked let me
[33:15] read verse two and let you be seated and
[33:17] be not conformed to this world but be it
[33:21] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[33:23] that you may prove what is that good and
[33:27] acceptable and perfect will of God if
[33:30] there's ever a quest that I feel like I
[33:33] am on and that is to
[33:36] to to manifest the perfect will of God
[33:40] Amen and I I don't need to know what it
[33:43] is I just know I just know that it's the
[33:45] word and when I say I don't know what it
[33:48] is I'm simply meaning that I don't know
[33:49] what tomorrow holds for me but I know
[33:52] that whatever it holds as long as I'm
[33:54] manifesting this all as well amen amen
[33:58] let's pray
[34:00] father we thank you this evening for
[34:03] your great love your great Mercy to us
[34:05] now I pray that your great anointing be
[34:09] upon the word blessing both speaker and
[34:12] hearer Lord and tired in body and mind
[34:15] but so thrilled in my heart at the same
[34:17] time and I've desired Lord to stand here
[34:20] tonight and deliver this thought I thank
[34:23] you for the weekend and all your great
[34:24] blessing and all your lord your presence
[34:28] that we have felt and bringing us back
[34:30] safely joining us back to our family

[34:36] love them and miss them and now here we
[34:38] are together again and I pray your great
[34:40] blessing now upon it all it's all for
[34:42] your glory in Jesus name amen God bless
[34:45] you friends you can be seated
[34:47] I
[34:49] want to ask for your undivided attention
[34:53] very quickly and
[34:56] um
[34:59] foreign
[35:03] I don't know what to do about that um
[35:07] so I can switch mics if that's needed uh
[35:11] someone just let me know
[35:13] um
[35:13] okay we'll try that
[35:18] amen
[35:19] hope that's better if not we can switch
[35:21] it out
[35:23] um I thought about doing some
[35:25] presentation tonight on the screen but
[35:27] it's a Wednesday night and I didn't want
[35:30] to do that we don't want to keep you too
[35:31] late and uh but I I want to
[35:35] move into this thought that's on my
[35:37] heart tonight and
[35:39] um I have a lengthy title it's rather
[35:43] cryptic and hard to grasp perhaps but
[35:46] I'll explain it quickly
[35:49] um you know and for certain uh so that
[35:53] you get a good understanding of it it's
[35:54] quite intentional and I'm taking the
[35:57] thought tonight Jehovah in the body
[36:00] bride
[36:01] of the sonship expression
[36:05] say that again Jehovah in the body Bride
[36:09] of the sonship expression now let me
[36:11] just help you understand where I'm going
[36:14] with that we were speaking about it
[36:16] today in fact is over our breakfast and
[36:19] we're referring back to Abraham and his
[36:21] promise now you've heard me talk about
[36:23] it before that you know the Bible tells
[36:27] us that there's none good no not one
[36:29] that there's not anyone who's been
[36:31] without sin and though we can we can
[36:34] look at the scriptural description of
[36:38] Abraham in the New Testament and it says
[36:41] Abraham staggered not in his faith and
[36:44] he staggered not at the promise of God
[36:46] and I've showed you how that the Old
[36:48] Testament reveals weaknesses in Abraham
[36:51] reveals how that he backslid and left
[36:54] the promised land and lied and did it
[36:56] twice uh and he you know wants to uh to
[37:00] Pharaoh where it nearly cost him his
[37:02] life and nearly cost him Sarah they pick
[37:04] up and he did made which I've I've said
[37:07] many times in picking up Hagar Israel to
[37:10] this day is paying for that mistake and
[37:13] so we find that then he he comes before
[37:15] abimelech the Philistine King and he's
[37:17] doing it again he's doing it again so it
[37:19] wasn't that Abraham didn't have his ups
[37:22] and downs like Elijah
[37:25] it wasn't that Abraham wasn't a man of
[37:27] like passions like Elijah Amen brother
[37:30] Brandon said that meant he had his ups
[37:32] and downs there was only one perfect man
[37:34] and that was Christ there's only one
[37:36] elected son and that's Christ how did I
[37:39] get elected because I was in Christ see
[37:42] and so so we find that what Abraham
[37:45] never staggered at was the promise
[37:48] Abraham
[37:50] Abraham was as far as his life was
[37:53] concerned
[37:56] an acceptance with God and a Justified
[37:59] State before God which is not an easy
[38:02] thing to get that it was actually
[38:04] imputed unto him not that he lived it to
[38:07] deserve it but that he didn't stagger at
[38:10] the promise in other words he believed
[38:12] the word
[38:14] and by believing the word for his hour
[38:16] God imputed all the righteousness of
[38:19] himself to Abraham
[38:21] wow
[38:22] see so so we find then that that to me
[38:26] this was so beautiful Sunday when
[38:29] brother uh don was reading from the
[38:31] wiestick expanded translation and that
[38:34] second verse how that he said to stop
[38:36] assuming an outward expression that does
[38:39] not come from within you and is not
[38:42] representative of what you are in your
[38:45] inner being
[38:46] I when you read that Brother Don I
[38:49] nearly jumped off the couch I couldn't
[38:50] believe what I was hearing this was so
[38:52] beautifully said and and and it goes on
[38:55] to say that that that you should but um
[38:59] not representative what you are on the
[39:00] inner uh your inner being but is
[39:03] patterned uh let me start again stop
[39:06] assuming the outward expression that
[39:09] does not come from within you and it's
[39:11] not representative of what you are in
[39:14] your inner being so it goes to show what
[39:16] brother Branham said there was another
[39:18] William Branham Town inside there see
[39:21] so but being but is TR but is patterned
[39:25] after this age so
[39:27] stop acting like you're you're a citizen
[39:31] of the age
[39:33] because you're not a citizen of of any
[39:36] age you're a citizen of Eternity
[39:39] see and so don't let your life be
[39:42] patterned like that but change your
[39:45] outward expression to one that comes
[39:48] from within and is representative of
[39:51] your inner being that is so powerful you
[39:53] know that that's when you go to look at
[39:56] some of the things that Paul talked
[39:58] about and Paul goes down a list and you
[40:00] know women call him a woman hater
[40:02] because you know he he talked about you
[40:04] know women not cutting their hair he
[40:06] talked about men uh having a short hair
[40:09] woman you know uh having long hair uncut
[40:13] hair and and it goes down into more than
[40:15] that he goes down into the areas of your
[40:18] life how you should live and how you
[40:19] should not live see and and the world
[40:22] loves the loves the ideology that well
[40:25] it's only what's in your heart that
[40:27] counts and and you say well you know God
[40:30] knows my heart I love him so it doesn't
[40:32] matter how I live first of all that's
[40:34] not novel that's not new that's
[40:37] gnosticism 101 and and I Irene has
[40:41] caught those gnostics the Sons of Satan
[40:45] so it does matter how you express the
[40:48] love of God in your heart and if the if
[40:50] God is truly in your heart you will obey
[40:54] the word of God and that's simple or
[40:56] you'll die trying and I I may not make
[40:59] it perfectly but I'll leave this world
[41:00] trying
[41:02] Hallelujah because it's my goal it's my
[41:05] everything and you know Paul when he a
[41:08] lot of people misunderstand they Paul
[41:11] what Paul is trying to get the church to
[41:14] understand is that how if I could say it
[41:17] like this
[41:18] how tragic it would be what a travesty
[41:23] What an unthinkable what a what a
[41:27] terrible thing if you as a real believer
[41:31] giving credit that you're a real one
[41:34] but that you lived in a certain way
[41:37] that was like the age and someone
[41:41] accidentally mistook you for not being a
[41:44] Christian
[41:46] Paul is like wow that's like the worst
[41:49] possible thing you could ever have
[41:51] happen is if your conversation or your
[41:54] lifestyle or where you went or your
[41:56] Recreation or how you dressed
[41:58] how you acted your attitude and your
[42:00] actions and reactions and somebody by
[42:03] mistake thought you weren't a Christian
[42:05] Paul is saying that is the most horrible
[42:08] thing to imagine happening to a child of
[42:11] God and we need to we need to take it we
[42:15] need to uh feel the weight of that
[42:17] friends it does matter and and Paul
[42:20] talked about a chaste conversation and
[42:22] that's not you know what you're saying
[42:24] out of your mouth merely but you're it's
[42:26] your it's the conversation of your life
[42:28] it that's why you're the final voice to
[42:31] the final age God doesn't need you to
[42:34] come and redo the shout what God needs
[42:37] you to do is be the Living Word
[42:42] see and so I I was so appreciating you
[42:46] know brother Don's angle that you're I
[42:48] wrote down some of his statements that
[42:51] just blew me over you're perfect by the
[42:53] blood but we're not we're not yet a
[42:55] finished work so he's still working I
[42:58] just say get out of the way and let him
[43:00] work
[43:04] I appreciated his reference to Ephesians
[43:07] 1 9-10 how that it was literally the
[43:10] very theme of the message it was the
[43:13] message in a nutshell that's exactly
[43:15] what brother Brandon was trying to get
[43:16] across to us in Christ is the mystery of
[43:19] God revealed having made known unto us
[43:22] the mystery of his will according to
[43:24] that which seemed good to him which good
[43:26] thing he purposed it himself with
[43:28] respect to an administration of the
[43:30] completion of the epoch of time tears
[43:33] here it is here's why the message came
[43:35] to bring back again to their original
[43:38] state all things in the Christ the
[43:42] things you're in the Christ
[43:44] he's bringing you back to an original
[43:47] state
[43:50] to all things in Christ the things in
[43:53] the heavens and the things on the earth
[43:55] in him because Christ is his word
[43:58] all right so so I love this statement
[44:01] Brother Don this one I'm gonna never
[44:03] forget this one we have to make the
[44:06] transition from becoming Believers to
[44:09] becoming becomers
[44:12] I want to run
[44:15] are like John dankba I want to run
[44:18] oh you know to think about it friend
[44:22] that that that as brother Dom was saying
[44:25] you can you can take that as a threat
[44:27] but you know it's it's not God trying to
[44:30] threaten you it's it's it's God it's God
[44:33] you know try it's God wanting you to
[44:36] come to this conclusion to say wow you
[44:40] mean all of this preaching and this hard
[44:42] line and this corrective preaching you
[44:45] can take it as a threat or you can say I
[44:47] oh God must love me he wants me to be
[44:50] like him and I thank God for it
[44:54] those are your two options
[44:57] he wants me to be free is there anything
[45:00] wrong with that
[45:01] he wants me to have a clean life he
[45:03] wants you to have a clean life he wants
[45:05] you to have a clean mind he wants you to
[45:07] have a clean home he wants you to have
[45:08] clean families
[45:10] how many can say me Lord me Lord I
[45:13] volunteer Hallelujah
[45:18] in the in the self-translation that I
[45:21] did some years ago the book of Romans
[45:24] I'm gonna from every re-familiarize you
[45:27] with that first and second verse
[45:29] the translation that I did verses one
[45:31] and two of Romans 12 I therefore
[45:34] I urge you Brothers
[45:36] in view of God's mercy to take every
[45:38] every day
[45:40] to start again therefore I urge you
[45:42] Brothers in view of God's mercy
[45:45] to take your everyday
[45:47] ordinary life you're sleeping eating
[45:51] going to work and walking around life
[45:53] and place it before God as a holy and
[45:57] acceptable sacrifice did I miss any
[46:01] important stage of your life this is
[46:03] your everyday walking talking life see
[46:05] whether you're at church on Sunday or at
[46:08] work on Monday
[46:09] see this is your spiritual act of
[46:13] worship and rational religious service
[46:16] to him verse 2. and do not conform
[46:21] yourselves to this age but be
[46:24] transformed by the word to operate the
[46:28] mind of Christ that you may be able to
[46:31] discern and follow God's will that is
[46:34] what is good well pleasing to him and
[46:38] perfect how many want to operate the
[46:40] mind of Christ
[46:42] do you know that you can separate
[46:44] yourself from the world and not be a
[46:47] person of the age but be a person of
[46:50] heaven and you will be the one God
[46:52] chooses to operate the mind of Christ
[46:56] because that's always been his plan
[47:00] so so it's amazing when I when I look at
[47:04] Romans 12.
[47:06] so so now I I I I should I should I
[47:09] should drop back to my opening volley to
[47:12] to finish that to to kind of get the
[47:15] other book into it
[47:17] so we we see Abraham
[47:20] making these kinds of mistakes
[47:22] but yet we see that because of his faith
[47:25] in the word god imputed righteousness to
[47:27] him
[47:28] by his faith see not of his Works lest
[47:31] anyone should boast
[47:33] and and and so so we find out that that
[47:36] when he he did that but everything
[47:39] everywhere that you read of his ups and
[47:42] downs and his backsliding
[47:45] was prior to him having the promised son
[47:50] once Isaac is born and now you have the
[47:54] office of sonship in Abraham's life now
[47:58] Abraham's life has been moved into sun
[48:01] oh my once that happened once sonship
[48:05] came about you never find again Abraham
[48:08] stumbling doubting falling I'm here to
[48:11] tell you that's what God sees In You and
[48:13] I
[48:14] and no wonder this is exactly my title
[48:17] Jehovah in the body Bride of the sonship
[48:21] expression you are perfect in Christ
[48:24] because you have believed the word
[48:28] and you've entered into an office of son
[48:30] you're the continuation of the son of
[48:33] God
[48:35] a direct quote you're part of God's
[48:37] godhead
[48:38] that's a statement
[48:40] see literally every son and daughter a
[48:44] part of God's godhead
[48:47] it's amazing how that this portion in
[48:50] Romans
[48:52] is all about God's work in you
[48:56] and your
[48:57] co-opting
[48:59] the process for yourself and cooperating
[49:03] in the vision it's a it's it's both it's
[49:07] God doing something and you saying I'll
[49:10] take that for me
[49:12] I'll be a part of it I'm gonna he says
[49:15] there I need to be a sacrifice I need to
[49:17] present my body and what's it going to
[49:19] do so that he can bring everything back
[49:21] to the original I'm going to co-op that
[49:22] plan I'm going to take a part of it I'm
[49:24] going to take advantage of it I'm going
[49:26] to cooperate in it how do you cooperate
[49:29] by living a Flawless life no by
[49:30] believing every word
[49:32] Hallelujah by by saying amen from my
[49:35] deepest realm in my heart and when I
[49:37] Stumble I'll go and repent and I'll say
[49:39] Lord you know I didn't mean to do that
[49:41] and that'll be true
[49:46] so it's amazing when I think about it
[49:49] how that this portion in Romans
[49:52] is all about God's work
[49:55] in you God working in you
[49:59] and and it's all about bringing you back
[50:01] to connect it with Ephesians 1 bringing
[50:03] you back to the original state
[50:06] and Paul says to present your bodies
[50:09] as your reasonable service
[50:13] 2 contains be it transformed
[50:17] by the renewing of your mind so it's an
[50:20] amazing thing that's going on here
[50:23] that God
[50:25] is doing
[50:26] and intending to have you as a partner
[50:31] see finishing the other end of it right
[50:35] yet by the time if we went on down to in
[50:38] our text by the time they get you get to
[50:41] verse 9
[50:43] somehow they've turned it around to
[50:47] standards for judging other people by
[50:50] and and lose the whole realization that
[50:54] he's working in you
[50:58] somehow from verse one to two just just
[51:00] a few just eight or nine verses later by
[51:03] the time you get to verse nine now
[51:04] they're already starting to oh wow God's
[51:07] doing this great thing for me well let
[51:08] me now I'm going to be the chief judge
[51:10] and I'm going to judge everybody that's
[51:12] not living as good as me and you've
[51:13] missed the whole point
[51:15] say it's already ran you off in a ditch
[51:18] and those people you're criticizing are
[51:19] already ahead of you
[51:22] because they're just humbly believing
[51:23] God's word
[51:24] Hallelujah see
[51:27] you know as a preacher I think every
[51:29] minister in here would agree
[51:31] as preachers we really can't help people
[51:33] who don't think they need help
[51:36] you know people who've already put a
[51:38] check mark by their name on all these
[51:40] practical instructions you know not not
[51:42] not it doesn't occur to them that Enoch
[51:45] was daily walking upward
[51:49] I'm pressing on the upward Way New
[51:53] Heights I'm gaining every day
[51:57] see brother Branham described like that
[51:59] he said Enoch just kept walking higher
[52:02] and higher till finally he got closer to
[52:04] Heaven it was closer to come on into
[52:06] heaven than it was to go back to Earth
[52:08] and he said God just took him
[52:10] I'm here to tell you something friends
[52:12] I'm pressing on the upward way and I
[52:15] love it that it was God God who finished
[52:18] the last leg of the journey God God took
[52:21] him I don't I don't think I'm qualified
[52:23] to change my body into a glorified body
[52:26] but I know there's coming a trumpet and
[52:29] I know God is going to keep his word and
[52:31] God is going to finish what I can't
[52:34] finish
[52:35] Hallelujah
[52:41] brother Brandon makes some astonishing
[52:43] statements out of this message Christ is
[52:45] the mystery of God revealed
[52:48] he starts talking about the threefold
[52:50] plan
[52:51] now it's a three-fold plan
[52:55] because remember he has one goal
[52:57] and it's in three phases
[53:00] the goal is expression brother random
[53:02] said in all the Bible God had one goal
[53:05] in all the people's lives everything
[53:07] that we read it's all God expressing his
[53:12] one goal
[53:14] and then brother Branham says and
[53:15] tonight we're going to see what that is
[53:18] and the whole sermon is about God
[53:22] expressing himself in Christ Christ
[53:24] expressing himself in the church brother
[53:26] Brandon says it like this speaking of
[53:28] his three-fold plan first to express
[53:31] himself completely God in Christ
[53:34] second to have the preeminence by this
[53:37] in his church which is his body the
[53:40] bride till he could have the preeminence
[53:42] to express himself through them not easy
[53:45] and thirdly here's the payoff to restore
[53:49] the kingdom that's me and you
[53:51] the kingdom to restore the kingdom to
[53:54] its rightly position that fell by sin by
[53:58] the first Adam
[54:01] all right so
[54:03] so phase one
[54:06] of God's threefold plan
[54:09] what's firstly
[54:10] for God to fully Express himself in
[54:13] Christ
[54:14] in the Earthly Tabernacle right
[54:18] so which of course you know
[54:21] I don't really have time to get into it
[54:24] tonight but that in other words to bring
[54:26] to fulfillment Exodus 40.
[54:28] because when you read Exodus 40 it's the
[54:31] whole Tabernacle how it's built every
[54:33] purpose every facet of it and it's all
[54:36] speaking about Christ he was in a body
[54:39] everything in all those verses I think
[54:41] 35 30 some odd more or more than that
[54:44] verses in Exodus 40. we don't have time
[54:46] to read it tonight I'm not really
[54:47] preaching on that but but one thing that
[54:50] is to be noted is that when you come
[54:52] when the when it's all finished and they
[54:55] get it completed verse 34 talks about
[54:59] how that that literally the glory of God
[55:03] came down and so literally the the the
[55:06] the the the Bible imagery that you're
[55:09] seeing is that that when it's all built
[55:12] according to God's word that that by
[55:15] faith every part was put together in
[55:18] obedience to God's word then the
[55:20] Tabernacle itself cries out with Glory
[55:24] and I mean when now now just follow it
[55:27] in the scripture because when you come
[55:29] to Luke Chapter 2 and now you've got God
[55:32] tabernacling that Tabernacle now in a
[55:35] body Angels appear and what do they say
[55:38] glory to God in the highest
[55:42] see
[55:43] and then and then so then Paul comes to
[55:46] to Romans chapter four I should I should
[55:49] probably I should probably just read
[55:51] that for you
[55:52] so Paul comes to Romans 4. he's talking
[55:55] about justification through faith all
[55:57] right so now he comes down here uh let
[56:00] me catch from verse 20.
[56:02] he staggered not at the promise of God
[56:04] through unbelief
[56:06] but was strong in faith
[56:10] see he staggered not at the promise
[56:13] but he was strong in faith he had ups
[56:17] and downs but he was strong in faith and
[56:21] he staggered not at the promise and what
[56:24] did that produce giving glory to God
[56:28] so at the when the Tabernacle is
[56:30] finished the Tabernacle declares Glory
[56:32] when Christ comes into his body the
[56:35] Angels declare Glory when Paul comes and
[56:37] says Abraham staggered not at the
[56:39] promise he was strong in the faith doing
[56:41] what what did that do it gave glory to
[56:44] God
[56:45] see and so then he goes on he says all
[56:49] right he says and being fully persuaded
[56:52] that what he had promised he was able
[56:55] also to perform and therefore therefore
[56:58] because of this Faith because his life
[57:01] his faith glorified God his his life
[57:04] didn't perfectly glorify God he had
[57:06] failures in it but what what glorified
[57:09] God was his faith and therefore God
[57:11] dismissed all of his failures and
[57:13] wouldn't even record them in the in the
[57:15] New Testament era and to say here's the
[57:18] Epitaph of his life he staggered not at
[57:20] the promise of God
[57:22] but whacked stronger the longer it went
[57:24] the the the strongest faith God see and
[57:27] so he says
[57:28] and being fully persuaded that what he
[57:30] had promised he was able to perform and
[57:32] therefore it was imputed to him for
[57:34] righteousness sake that's fantastic
[57:36] brother Paul I'm glad to know that about
[57:39] Abraham Paul's not finished
[57:42] verse 23
[57:44] . now it was not written for his sake
[57:47] alone that it was imputed unto him but
[57:51] for us also to whom it shall be
[57:55] shall be if we believe leave on him that
[57:57] raised up Jesus our lord from the dead
[58:00] who was delivered for our offenses and
[58:04] raised for our justification now when he
[58:08] comes in Acts chapter 2 what is it doing
[58:10] it's bringing glory to God again because
[58:13] the word has tabernacled in flesh and
[58:16] you've got a bride body who has now
[58:19] entered into the office of son
[58:23] and what does your life do what does
[58:25] your faith do it brings glory to God
[58:29] see
[58:30] oh my
[58:32] wish I had time to preach on that
[58:36] so
[58:38] so when we look at Romans 1 and 2.
[58:42] so we see God
[58:44] giving us the instructions
[58:46] how to get to where he wants us to be
[58:49] make your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[58:51] don't be conformed
[58:53] don't don't don't let your outside look
[58:55] like the age
[58:57] because that's not the real you
[58:59] let your outside match your inside amen
[59:02] amen see
[59:03] and so so so so that this was now god's
[59:07] second phase there in Acts 2 he's
[59:09] gaining preeminence in his church and
[59:12] his body because that that that's that's
[59:15] just as important as phase one
[59:20] phase two is made possible by phase one
[59:24] phase one was God that manifesting
[59:26] himself fully in Christ but phase two is
[59:28] just as important because brother
[59:31] Brandon picks that up in the Rising Sun
[59:33] and he and he starts tying there in a
[59:36] few other places and he starts talking
[59:37] about Jesus raising from the tomb and
[59:39] how glorious it was and there had never
[59:40] been a man there have been many great
[59:42] men and many great men died for a very
[59:45] great cause but there had never been a
[59:47] man who could raise himself back up
[59:50] again
[59:50] after he died see and but and you know
[59:54] the whole audience there is rejoicing in
[59:57] that and then brother Branham almost
[59:58] like a wet blanket he says now that was
[1:00:01] fine that was great for him but what's
[1:00:03] that do for me
[1:00:05] I'm glad he raised
[1:00:07] but what about me
[1:00:09] if that same spirit that raised Jesus
[1:00:12] from the dead dwell in you it shall also
[1:00:16] Quicken your mortal body I'm so glad the
[1:00:19] devil can't stop that I'm so glad he's
[1:00:22] but it's already too late I've already
[1:00:24] believed I've already had it
[1:00:26] righteousness imputed I'm already
[1:00:28] walking the upper way
[1:00:33] oh my
[1:00:35] so he's coming into his second phase
[1:00:38] and so just like phase one makes way for
[1:00:42] phase two Romans 12 1 makes white for
[1:00:44] Romans 12 2.
[1:00:46] and in fact is
[1:00:50] verse 2
[1:00:51] not only I mean verse 2 is what really
[1:00:56] glorifies God that it worked
[1:01:00] that he was a sacrifice and you're a
[1:01:02] sacrifice and he lived obedient and you
[1:01:04] live obedient and you allow you don't
[1:01:07] let your mind be transformed by the age
[1:01:10] see you you you you're transformed by
[1:01:12] the Holy Spirit
[1:01:14] see by how renewing of your mind
[1:01:18] to prove what is that good and
[1:01:20] acceptable thing
[1:01:22] so then it literally literally verse 2
[1:01:26] is made possible by verse one and in
[1:01:28] fact it gives purpose to verse one so
[1:01:31] then when you come to God's third phase
[1:01:33] of restoring the kingdom that is all
[1:01:36] made possible and it actually gives it
[1:01:39] further purpose when you have because
[1:01:42] now it's actually combining verse 1 and
[1:01:44] verse two because now he's actually
[1:01:46] accomplishing his goal his goal was
[1:01:49] expression and he's coming to his third
[1:01:51] phase of restoring the kingdom don't
[1:01:54] think of somewhere over a rainbow in
[1:01:58] Alpha Centauri brother Branham says in
[1:02:00] the seventh seal he says this has been
[1:02:02] happening and this has been happening he
[1:02:04] said what is it it's the kingdom coming
[1:02:07] as it has been I'm here to tell you when
[1:02:11] uh why not when the mighty Angel
[1:02:13] descended and and when he comes to claim
[1:02:15] the book what is he doing he's going to
[1:02:18] get to the point where he calls for his
[1:02:19] Queen to stand by his side and I'm here
[1:02:22] to tell you that's going to happen oh
[1:02:25] one of these days a trumpet will sound
[1:02:27] in the dead and Christ shall rise and we
[1:02:29] which Our Lives remain shall be changed
[1:02:32] and caught up together
[1:02:35] so it all gives purpose and makes it
[1:02:38] even possible in fact is restoring the
[1:02:40] kingdom that's why Revelation 11 1 shows
[1:02:44] the bride's final view the final the
[1:02:48] final Testament of the Bride after
[1:02:50] Revelation 10 is completed the last
[1:02:53] thing you see is a measurable standard
[1:02:56] of an inner of an inner inner sanctuary
[1:02:59] and it says don't measure the outer
[1:03:01] court because that's given to the
[1:03:02] Gentiles they're headed into a
[1:03:03] tribulation but measure the inside where
[1:03:06] the Shekinah is where the pride is when
[1:03:09] she leaves the Earth she's in his very
[1:03:12] image
[1:03:15] see so here we see it helps our
[1:03:18] understanding in the godhead because
[1:03:20] first Elohim is in the Sun and now the
[1:03:23] expression of Jehovah he's now in an
[1:03:26] expression in his entire bride body see
[1:03:28] so so then it's fully Jehovah hence my
[1:03:32] title then it's fully Jehovah and the
[1:03:36] body Bride of the sonship expression see
[1:03:40] at producing and now manifesting and
[1:03:44] this is big it's now manifesting the
[1:03:47] great mystery
[1:03:48] of husband and wife
[1:03:53] see it's always been husband and wife
[1:03:56] because it's husband and wife who come
[1:03:59] together and bring forth A reproduction
[1:04:01] what what's what's coming what's coming
[1:04:04] reproduced the seed of the progenitor
[1:04:07] the very God of creation they're very
[1:04:11] Fountain way back there in eternity that
[1:04:13] brother Branham said oh that Fountain
[1:04:15] way back in eternity before there was
[1:04:17] even anything that Fountain was there
[1:04:19] and out of it was flowing Grace and love
[1:04:23] and mercy and God with his attributes of
[1:04:26] wanting to be a family and envisioned
[1:04:28] you and envisioned me I hope that I hope
[1:04:32] that burns in your heart tonight you're
[1:04:34] a Believer because he envisioned you
[1:04:37] oh my husband and wife are actually the
[1:04:41] original model to do what to bring forth
[1:04:43] A reproduction see so Christ you know it
[1:04:47] Christ the word of God which in fact was
[1:04:49] God it was with God and actually it was
[1:04:52] God see so it's Christ in you Paul said
[1:04:55] this great mystery it's Christ in you
[1:04:57] the hope of glory so it's God bringing
[1:05:01] forth his kingdom the original vision of
[1:05:03] God
[1:05:04] and the answer
[1:05:06] to the original question
[1:05:11] why
[1:05:14] why what
[1:05:18] the why of everything
[1:05:21] the wife of everything
[1:05:23] the whole purpose and the true meaning
[1:05:26] of life in the first place
[1:05:29] ain't what people say what's the whole
[1:05:30] meaning of life I'm preaching on it
[1:05:32] tonight this was the whole meaning of
[1:05:34] life this was the assistant the answer
[1:05:36] to all the questions
[1:05:38] see
[1:05:39] so when they come to him to Jesus in
[1:05:42] Matthew 16.
[1:05:45] um give me that brother Joshua uh
[1:05:48] Matthew 16 and what does catch uh maybe
[1:05:52] 13 through 19. let's just do that for
[1:05:55] now
[1:05:57] so he says here Matthew 16 13-19
[1:06:02] oh I gotta hurry
[1:06:03] when Jesus came into the coast of
[1:06:06] caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples
[1:06:08] saying
[1:06:11] who do men
[1:06:12] that's one who do men say
[1:06:15] that I am so that's one question
[1:06:18] about a specific category of people
[1:06:21] who do men say
[1:06:23] all right
[1:06:25] that I the son of man am
[1:06:27] and they said well
[1:06:29] some say that thou art John the Baptist
[1:06:32] this is what people say
[1:06:34] some Elijah
[1:06:38] others Jeremiah one of the prophets
[1:06:41] now watch the distinction
[1:06:43] he saith unto them but whom say ye
[1:06:48] that I am
[1:06:50] so notice the distinction he draws
[1:06:54] that Brother Don was zeroing in on this
[1:06:57] that that real you that's down on the
[1:07:00] inside a part of God's literal DNA
[1:07:05] a part of your from God's Gene that's
[1:07:07] why you believe the word
[1:07:09] that's why you can't be lost that's why
[1:07:13] you can't be deceived see
[1:07:15] because this bride in the last day is
[1:07:18] prophesied that she's going to receive
[1:07:21] the restoration of the full word
[1:07:23] and then she's going to pick up where
[1:07:26] the first church began to decline and
[1:07:28] she's going to carry it on to a body
[1:07:29] change
[1:07:30] and there's not another age coming you
[1:07:33] are the last generation that will ever
[1:07:34] be in history you are the generation
[1:07:36] upon whom the ends of the world have
[1:07:37] come this is it we're wrapping up we're
[1:07:39] going home
[1:07:42] the craziness of the world should inform
[1:07:44] your thinking on that if nothing does
[1:07:47] so so when he he's he makes this
[1:07:51] distinction okay who do they say but who
[1:07:53] do you say see
[1:07:55] because Paul picks that up in in his
[1:07:57] letter to the thessalonicans also
[1:07:59] you know he starts talking about how
[1:08:01] that your children of the day
[1:08:03] you're not of the night
[1:08:05] they that are drunken or drunken at
[1:08:07] night but you are of the day we be not
[1:08:10] of them
[1:08:11] you understand
[1:08:13] he goes on so he's asked but but he said
[1:08:15] unto them whom say ye that I am and
[1:08:18] Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art
[1:08:21] the Christ the son of a living God and
[1:08:23] Jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[1:08:25] art thou Simon
[1:08:27] barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not
[1:08:30] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[1:08:32] which is in heaven
[1:08:35] now that can only be a spiritual
[1:08:37] experience
[1:08:38] see because it's not something he
[1:08:40] learned from flesh and blood so it's
[1:08:43] spiritual it's some Supernatural and
[1:08:46] Jesus doesn't mince words my Father in
[1:08:48] Heaven taught you that see and I and
[1:08:51] I've taught it for years and showed you
[1:08:53] from the from the original Greek and I
[1:08:55] uh from the from the imminent uh Greek
[1:08:57] Theologian Spirit zodiatis the editor of
[1:09:00] one of my of my Bible I carried for
[1:09:02] years uh and I got this recent uh
[1:09:04] Spurgeon Bible which I love even more
[1:09:07] but
[1:09:08] but when you when I was I remembered as
[1:09:10] a young preacher and I was looking at
[1:09:13] zodiati's notes
[1:09:14] on that verse because he he made the
[1:09:17] point that it's unfortunate that people
[1:09:20] think of this term blessed art thou that
[1:09:23] word blessed that it somehow means
[1:09:25] fortunate or lucky
[1:09:27] and he says it doesn't mean that at all
[1:09:28] it says it's an unfortunate
[1:09:29] misunderstanding of the Greek language
[1:09:31] because in English you think oh blessed
[1:09:33] well he's he's fortunate he said it's
[1:09:35] not about being fortunate it's not about
[1:09:37] you know winning a lottery
[1:09:40] that literally this is his words of the
[1:09:43] meaning now ironically after he passed
[1:09:45] away
[1:09:46] a bunch of people got in there in his
[1:09:48] organization and they watered it all
[1:09:49] down after I got like my third edition
[1:09:51] they had changed that but I still got
[1:09:53] the first one in my storage and I've got
[1:09:56] it underlined and he he says it comes
[1:09:58] from a Greek word McKay it's from it's a
[1:10:01] word macarius from the root McCary
[1:10:03] Macario and and he says literally what
[1:10:07] it means Is possessing the
[1:10:10] characteristic of deity
[1:10:13] wow
[1:10:15] so Jesus isn't saying to Peter you're
[1:10:18] really lucky that you understand that
[1:10:20] you're really fortunate you're up you're
[1:10:21] ahead of the class you're you're ahead
[1:10:23] of your of your fellows that's not it he
[1:10:26] was saying Peter you recognize me and I
[1:10:30] recognize you I say that thou art Peter
[1:10:32] and you recognize me and I recognize you
[1:10:34] because we have a common father
[1:10:37] that we came from the same progenitor
[1:10:40] we came from the same gene pool
[1:10:43] Hallelujah and that's how you know who I
[1:10:46] am in the world flesh and blood never
[1:10:48] taught it they can't teach it it came
[1:10:51] from my father
[1:10:53] you are The Offspring of my father you
[1:10:58] are my brother you will be the when when
[1:11:00] the Holy Ghost comes you will be the
[1:11:02] continuation of my life
[1:11:06] Hallelujah
[1:11:07] see
[1:11:09] so he says and I say unto thee Thou Art
[1:11:12] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[1:11:14] church upon what rock a revelation
[1:11:17] how does it come it's given by God
[1:11:20] well how does that work because you're a
[1:11:22] part of God and you recognize the word
[1:11:24] you're a part of and you can't even deny
[1:11:26] it
[1:11:27] see
[1:11:29] so it's never been about people getting
[1:11:31] lucky or people getting smart
[1:11:33] it's not about that election is based
[1:11:36] squarely on Origin brother JD's been
[1:11:38] teaching that it's based squarely on
[1:11:40] Origin
[1:11:41] Jesus said I come from God I go back to
[1:11:44] God
[1:11:45] Jesus knowing that he came from God and
[1:11:47] went to God laid aside his garments
[1:11:50] see and so
[1:11:52] so he says Thou Art Peter Upon This Rock
[1:11:55] I'll build my church in the Gates of
[1:11:57] Hell cannot Prevail against it
[1:12:00] and I will give unto thee the Keys of
[1:12:02] the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:12:03] because
[1:12:05] I will give keys to the family
[1:12:08] I'm not going to give them to non-family
[1:12:10] nobody in non-family's not getting keys
[1:12:13] to my house but I'll gladly give my
[1:12:15] garage code and my keys to my family
[1:12:18] you understand so I will give Thee the
[1:12:21] keys to the kingdom of heaven and
[1:12:22] whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth
[1:12:24] shall be bound in heaven this is Jesus
[1:12:26] prophesying knowing that his mind would
[1:12:28] be in Peter knowing that that's what the
[1:12:31] Holy Ghost would come for that this mind
[1:12:35] that was in Christ could be in you so
[1:12:38] that you could make your body a Living
[1:12:39] Sacrifice so that you wouldn't be
[1:12:41] conformed to the world not you not you
[1:12:44] you can be transformed by the renewing
[1:12:46] of your mind
[1:12:48] see
[1:12:51] and I will give unto thee the Keys of
[1:12:52] the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever
[1:12:54] Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound
[1:12:56] in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt
[1:12:57] loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven
[1:12:58] let me try to
[1:13:00] zip through these quotes real quick this
[1:13:02] is all from Christ is the mystery of God
[1:13:03] revealed
[1:13:05] brother Brandon picks up paragraph 216.
[1:13:09] now if you
[1:13:11] you're if you go go back and for those
[1:13:13] listening if you hit an archive and
[1:13:15] you're making notes you're if you pull
[1:13:16] up the quotes you're going to see that
[1:13:18] I'm reading and then I'm skipping and
[1:13:19] reading and skipping and reading because
[1:13:21] it's way too much to read uh to you but
[1:13:23] it's all there you can go back and get
[1:13:25] it
[1:13:27] paragraph 216. he said
[1:13:29] who do you think that I am now
[1:13:32] now there is the church he is talking to
[1:13:35] see what does man think I am all right
[1:13:38] so now do you have your distinction in
[1:13:40] mind you got that remember he's made a
[1:13:43] distinction
[1:13:44] all right so now we're going forward
[1:13:45] everybody got that
[1:13:47] all right today so here he says what
[1:13:50] does man think that I am and brother
[1:13:51] Branham just brings it up takes two
[1:13:53] Millennial leaps and brings it into our
[1:13:55] modern day he says well today
[1:13:58] he's a philosopher
[1:14:00] this social religion he was a good man
[1:14:02] we believe his teaching is right it's
[1:14:04] subject to be lived by I think it make
[1:14:07] us all better if we did it we ought to
[1:14:09] have it in our churches and so forth
[1:14:12] brother Branham says that's a Santa
[1:14:14] Claus
[1:14:16] that's a Santa Claus
[1:14:18] like a Santa Claus story
[1:14:21] paragraph 218 it's not expressions of
[1:14:24] some church that we should Express
[1:14:26] something it's a life that you don't
[1:14:29] live yourself but he comes in you and
[1:14:32] lives by himself and you become a
[1:14:35] prisoner
[1:14:38] put on the gods Lord oh and I love this
[1:14:42] I love this because this here's an angle
[1:14:44] brother Dom was trying to get you to you
[1:14:46] know let let go of your own mind there's
[1:14:48] a greater mind to be had see and so
[1:14:51] brother Branham says you become a
[1:14:54] prisoner to what what am I prisoner to
[1:14:56] to any human intellectual being at all
[1:14:59] you're you're you're you're locked away
[1:15:01] in Christ by Revelation you're not
[1:15:02] subject to man-made reasoning you're
[1:15:05] immune from that you're predestinated to
[1:15:08] be immune from the lie that's taking
[1:15:11] down the whole world
[1:15:14] and you've got an injected immunity that
[1:15:17] you cannot be deceived by that lie
[1:15:20] though it's taking down seven and a half
[1:15:23] billion humans it won't take you
[1:15:26] because why you have a characteristic of
[1:15:29] deity down inside of you
[1:15:32] see
[1:15:34] so he says
[1:15:38] you're led by the spirit
[1:15:40] and how do you know how do you know
[1:15:43] he says if you have the mind of Christ
[1:15:46] expresses himself through you shows that
[1:15:49] it's him and not you
[1:15:51] see so now we're coming back to our very
[1:15:53] daily walking around walking talking
[1:15:56] working living life
[1:15:59] now you're getting down to what it means
[1:16:01] to not be conformed Paul wouldn't say
[1:16:04] that if it was if it was needless
[1:16:06] see
[1:16:09] absorb that
[1:16:11] get that
[1:16:12] he's talking to believers and he's
[1:16:15] telling them don't be conformed
[1:16:18] see because
[1:16:20] you you can get that way
[1:16:22] but I'm telling you be transformed by
[1:16:26] the renewing of your mind
[1:16:27] so that you can prove whose family
[1:16:29] you're in
[1:16:30] so they can prove God's word is true
[1:16:34] say why doesn't it just work
[1:16:35] automatically because God didn't want a
[1:16:37] kingdom of robots he wants a kingdom of
[1:16:40] Overcomers
[1:16:42] see you you've got it you've got to
[1:16:44] advance now to becoming a becomer not
[1:16:47] just a believer but a becomer
[1:16:51] so he says
[1:16:53] a real man is to lose his own thoughts
[1:16:56] and his own thinking
[1:16:58] not come up blindly like that no sir you
[1:17:00] you come up with your right senses he's
[1:17:03] talking about you know you're not insane
[1:17:04] you're not crazy like the world thinks
[1:17:06] you are Christ takes you over and
[1:17:08] expresses himself and now to the world
[1:17:10] you're an insane person
[1:17:13] see
[1:17:14] but in your mind
[1:17:16] that you know I can just speak for
[1:17:17] myself and I trust and hope that you
[1:17:20] have the same feeling
[1:17:21] when I look around at what this world
[1:17:23] has become and is becoming every day
[1:17:26] it has be it is becoming so twisted and
[1:17:29] so perverted and so impossible and I I
[1:17:33] disdain all of it I think it's crazy I
[1:17:36] don't want nothing to do with it I want
[1:17:38] to I want to escape it I want to see a
[1:17:41] new world I'm not interested in being a
[1:17:44] success story of this age Hallelujah I
[1:17:47] might have to live in an alley by but
[1:17:49] I'll have eternal life
[1:17:51] I'm not I'm I'm not putting all my chips
[1:17:54] on this life this life means very little
[1:17:57] it only matters the next life
[1:18:01] see
[1:18:04] and when Christ takes you over he'll
[1:18:06] Express that word right through you
[1:18:08] because it's him he is the word see and
[1:18:11] then you can see the expression of
[1:18:13] Christ not some illusion of some sort
[1:18:15] but a real genuine Christ expressing
[1:18:17] himself right through you how beautiful
[1:18:20] that's real Beauty see
[1:18:22] so he says he goes on here paragraph 225
[1:18:25] dropping down
[1:18:26] he is asking the church his twelve out
[1:18:30] of the millions of that day he has 12
[1:18:32] his church
[1:18:33] in the millions in the days of Noah he
[1:18:36] asked eight
[1:18:38] the whole thing paragraph 230 the whole
[1:18:40] thing is the revelation of God to do
[1:18:43] what to take Eve back to her rightly to
[1:18:47] her right position again with her
[1:18:49] husband notice and God is the husband of
[1:18:53] the church and the church is his bride
[1:18:57] so he says now Peter when he called said
[1:19:00] Thou Art the Christ the son of living
[1:19:02] God now watch blessed art thou Simon by
[1:19:04] Jonah which means son of Jonah see
[1:19:07] blessed art thou for Flesh and Blood
[1:19:09] never revealed this to you that's Peter
[1:19:11] the predestinated seed of God that had
[1:19:14] received this light and given the keys
[1:19:17] to the kingdom I'll build my church Upon
[1:19:19] This Rock a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:19:23] all right now watch I'm just I'm taking
[1:19:26] my last five or six minutes all right
[1:19:28] Christ's life in you
[1:19:32] makes him the center of the revelation
[1:19:36] now how important is it to be
[1:19:39] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:19:40] how important is it to not be conformed
[1:19:43] by the world how important is it see
[1:19:45] because if you can if you can accomplish
[1:19:48] what Paul is saying then Christ becomes
[1:19:50] the center of your life the center of
[1:19:51] your Revelation see
[1:19:53] and so Christ in you he says all right
[1:19:55] so so Christ's life in you makes him the
[1:19:59] center of the Revelation Christ in the
[1:20:01] Bible makes the Bible the complete
[1:20:03] revelation of Christ Christ in you makes
[1:20:05] the complete revelation of the whole
[1:20:07] thing see what God is trying to do see
[1:20:11] what God is trying to do
[1:20:13] what is the new birth then you'd say
[1:20:15] well brother Branham what is the new
[1:20:18] birth it is the revelation of Jesus
[1:20:21] Christ personally to you amen see not
[1:20:25] you joined a church you shook a hand you
[1:20:28] done something different you said a
[1:20:30] Creed you promised to live by a code of
[1:20:33] rules it's Christ in you that is the
[1:20:37] Revelation that the church is built upon
[1:20:40] what is it last one what is it it's
[1:20:43] Christ paragraph 236 what is it it's
[1:20:46] Christ being revealed and he is the word
[1:20:49] and when the word is revealed it
[1:20:51] expresses itself isn't that easy
[1:20:54] see that's God's purpose for Jesus
[1:20:57] Christ was to express himself to take
[1:21:01] his own laws and live by his laws and
[1:21:05] fulfill his laws by death and Christ God
[1:21:08] died in human flesh in order to condemn
[1:21:12] sin in the flesh
[1:21:14] see so so so Peter we want to take time
[1:21:18] to turn Peter talks about in First Peter
[1:21:20] 2 24 who his own self bear our sins in
[1:21:23] his own body on the tree Paul picks up
[1:21:26] in Colossians 2 10-14 and you're
[1:21:28] completing him which is the head of all
[1:21:30] principality and Power in whom also
[1:21:33] you're circumcised with the circumcision
[1:21:35] made without hands and putting off the
[1:21:37] body of the sins of the flesh by the
[1:21:39] circumcision of Christ buried with him
[1:21:41] in baptism wherein also you're risen
[1:21:44] with him through the faith of the
[1:21:45] operation of God who hath raised him
[1:21:48] from the dead now watch first last two
[1:21:50] verses and you being dead in your sins
[1:21:53] and the uncircumcision of your flesh
[1:21:56] hath he quickened together with him
[1:21:58] having forgiven you all trespasses
[1:22:00] blotting out the handwriting of
[1:22:03] ordinances that was against us which was
[1:22:06] contrary to us and took it out of the
[1:22:08] way nailing it to his cross
[1:22:12] so the Amplified says it like this in
[1:22:14] verse 14 having canceled and blotted out
[1:22:18] and wiped away the handwriting of the
[1:22:22] bond the note the bond with its legal
[1:22:25] decrees and its demands which was in
[1:22:27] force and stood against us hostile to us
[1:22:31] this note with its regulations decrees
[1:22:34] and demands he has set aside and cleared
[1:22:38] completely out of the way by nailing it
[1:22:42] to his cross
[1:22:45] by the way whis says it like this having
[1:22:49] obliterated
[1:22:52] the handwritten document consisting of
[1:22:55] ordinances the one which was against us
[1:22:59] which was directly opposed to us and he
[1:23:02] removed it out of the midst with the
[1:23:05] result with the result you want the
[1:23:07] result you want a cliffhanger
[1:23:09] with the result see
[1:23:12] that it no it is no longer there having
[1:23:17] nailed it to his cross
[1:23:20] the NLT says it like this he canceled
[1:23:24] the record of the charges against us and
[1:23:27] took it away by nailing it to his cross
[1:23:30] Hallelujah the MSG says that old arrest
[1:23:33] warrant was canceled
[1:23:37] Hallelujah I'm here to tell you Luther
[1:23:39] nailed a 95 thesis to Wittenberg church
[1:23:42] but that was nothing compared to the
[1:23:45] book he nailed to his cross and I'm free
[1:23:49] tonight it's been canceled and removed
[1:23:52] Hallelujah
[1:23:55] oh friends that's where we live in the
[1:23:57] realities of God's word
[1:24:00] by by the by the sacrifice of himself
[1:24:04] see
[1:24:06] because our flesh is the problem
[1:24:09] I realize I just want to read these I
[1:24:11] thought I thought it was I got two more
[1:24:13] quotes right here
[1:24:15] because our flesh is the problem
[1:24:19] so
[1:24:21] he condemned sin
[1:24:23] in the flesh
[1:24:25] because your flesh was the problem
[1:24:28] so you know what he did he condemned sin
[1:24:31] in the flesh
[1:24:33] because you know why because I couldn't
[1:24:37] pull it off
[1:24:39] my heart loves him
[1:24:42] my heart believes his word
[1:24:45] My Flesh was the problem but my heart
[1:24:47] loves him
[1:24:48] My Flesh was a problem but my heart
[1:24:50] believes him so what did he do he knew I
[1:24:53] would believe his word he put a gene
[1:24:55] inside me but this old stinking flesh
[1:24:58] and so he condemned sin in the flesh and
[1:25:02] removed all the ordinance against you
[1:25:04] and against me forever
[1:25:07] now I stand perfect before God why
[1:25:11] because I'm good enough I got a book of
[1:25:13] rules no because I have believed his
[1:25:16] word like Abraham I believe his word
[1:25:21] [Applause]
[1:25:23] so brother Brandon says finally
[1:25:26] that he might bring to himself a
[1:25:28] glorious bride redeemed back
[1:25:31] that will believe only in the word of
[1:25:33] God and not swap it like he did
[1:25:35] for intellectual conceptions of man you
[1:25:37] see it
[1:25:38] that's Christ's idea
[1:25:42] that's God's idea the new birth reveals
[1:25:46] this it's a man who came up with this
[1:25:48] plan God
[1:25:50] well you you sure seem to count yourself
[1:25:53] pretty pretty amazing well it wasn't my
[1:25:56] plan
[1:25:57] I I was finished I couldn't do anything
[1:25:59] I couldn't even get out of the Dugout
[1:26:01] much less walk up to the to the to the
[1:26:03] batter's box but somebody came out on my
[1:26:06] behalf
[1:26:08] Hallelujah
[1:26:10] then the new birth in Christ pair of
[1:26:12] 240.
[1:26:14] the the new birth in Christ
[1:26:16] is a revelation
[1:26:19] God has revealed to you this great
[1:26:23] mystery and that's a new birth
[1:26:25] now what are you going to do when you
[1:26:29] get all that group together
[1:26:31] where the Revelation is perfectly in
[1:26:34] Harmony and God expressing it through
[1:26:36] his word by the same actions the same
[1:26:38] things he did making the word manifest
[1:26:41] he's so so the question is what's going
[1:26:44] to happen when all of that group gets
[1:26:46] together see oh if the church only knew
[1:26:50] its position it will one day then the
[1:26:53] Rapture will go when it knows what it is
[1:26:57] why was Brother Don why was Brother JD
[1:27:00] laboring to show you the gene of God for
[1:27:02] weeks and weeks why was Brother Don
[1:27:04] laboring to try to get you to understand
[1:27:06] the real mystery of God what is this all
[1:27:08] about tonight what is it about to say
[1:27:10] this is Jehovah now tabernacling in his
[1:27:13] pride body and she's come into the
[1:27:16] office of son Hallelujah she's The
[1:27:18] Offspring of God
[1:27:21] see the blindness of the age
[1:27:24] I'm gonna say this come on musicians
[1:27:26] Anthony bring your team and come on
[1:27:32] I'll make these last comments to you
[1:27:36] the blindness of this age
[1:27:38] I want you to absorb this don't get
[1:27:39] distracted don't run out the door yet
[1:27:44] there's a great blindness on this last
[1:27:45] generation
[1:27:48] it's prophesied in the Bible
[1:27:49] you can read about it in Revelation 3.
[1:27:53] and the blindness of the age
[1:27:57] deceives this last generation of
[1:27:59] humanity
[1:28:01] into thinking
[1:28:03] in their
[1:28:06] pitiful state
[1:28:07] it deceives them into thinking they have
[1:28:11] need of nothing
[1:28:13] it that's the same as saying
[1:28:16] it deceives them into thinking they have
[1:28:19] all they need
[1:28:22] see but your revelation
[1:28:27] given to you by God tells you otherwise
[1:28:31] you're not deceived by that a blindness
[1:28:34] that's taking seven and a half billion
[1:28:35] people
[1:28:37] but your Revelation given to you by God
[1:28:40] tells you otherwise
[1:28:43] the world believes
[1:28:45] that they are making a better world to
[1:28:47] live in but a prophet said
[1:28:50] he acknowledged that that's what they
[1:28:52] think a prophet understood that he
[1:28:53] discerned their hearts and they didn't
[1:28:54] really want that but that's what
[1:28:55] prophets do
[1:28:57] and he said they think they're making a
[1:29:01] better world to live in by their
[1:29:03] knowledge brother Branham said they're
[1:29:05] actually making a better world to sin in
[1:29:09] and it's getting easier and easier at
[1:29:12] magnificently easier with every passing
[1:29:16] day that they eat from the Tree of
[1:29:18] knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:29:20] they are believing now what's causing
[1:29:24] this because they're believing a false
[1:29:27] word catch that they're believing a
[1:29:30] false word of the devil which brother
[1:29:33] Branham called a delusion by Satan
[1:29:36] see
[1:29:38] so they're believing a false word by the
[1:29:41] devil you try to tell them that they are
[1:29:44] destroying life
[1:29:46] which they will
[1:29:48] the end of the tribulation God don't
[1:29:49] have to destroy anything man he always
[1:29:51] let man destroy himself and you try to
[1:29:53] tell them that they're destroying life
[1:29:56] and yet they will say no we're improving
[1:30:00] life
[1:30:02] they're wrong
[1:30:04] they're wrong
[1:30:06] they say no we're improving life they're
[1:30:09] wrong
[1:30:10] now
[1:30:11] you have received a true word
[1:30:15] not a delusion by Satan you have
[1:30:17] received a true word and you have
[1:30:19] received a promise that when the seal is
[1:30:22] broken it releases the what's on the
[1:30:24] inside and brother Branham said that
[1:30:27] word is released and down comes an
[1:30:30] anointing upon the word to make it live
[1:30:33] to make it live inside of you Hallelujah
[1:30:38] on you say well brother Jason I don't I
[1:30:40] really don't believe that I'm
[1:30:42] accomplishing that
[1:30:43] you're wrong
[1:30:46] you're wrong he's doing more in you than
[1:30:50] you are aware
[1:30:51] the world believes they're creating life
[1:30:54] they're wrong because they're believing
[1:30:56] a delusion by Satan you're believing the
[1:30:58] engrafted word the unsealed mystery you
[1:31:01] say oh I don't think I'm making it I'm
[1:31:03] not overcoming you're wrong you're wrong
[1:31:05] you're wrong you're wrong God has
[1:31:07] already overcome everything you have
[1:31:10] need of
[1:31:11] you're you're going in a Rapture because
[1:31:13] you have believed the word of God
[1:31:16] and it didn't come from man and Flesh
[1:31:19] and Blood didn't teach it but your
[1:31:21] father which is in heaven
[1:31:24] oh your faith in the revealed word is
[1:31:28] gaining more and more life from the Tree
[1:31:30] of Life how many want that life from the
[1:31:33] Tree of Life not the knowledge of of
[1:31:35] Good and Evil but from the Tree of Life
[1:31:38] oh let's stand friends can you absorb
[1:31:41] tonight that you are literally Jehovah
[1:31:45] Jehovah is now living in his bride body
[1:31:49] she's now the continuation of his life
[1:31:53] she's the expression in sonship
[1:31:56] God has accomplished this because
[1:32:00] he sent a word that was kin to you
[1:32:04] he sent a word and you believed it
[1:32:06] because there was a word inside of you
[1:32:10] and two omnipotents met
[1:32:12] and brother Brandon said when light
[1:32:14] struck that seed it come to life say
[1:32:16] brother Jason did you feel good enough
[1:32:18] to be a believer no but when light
[1:32:20] struck the sea I come to life oh do you
[1:32:23] think that you deserve to go on a
[1:32:24] Rapture quite actually no but light
[1:32:27] struck the sea and life has come forth

[1:41:16] and praise the Lord sister Martha let me
[1:41:18] hold on honey
[1:41:19] oh I don't have Mike where is it ah
[1:41:23] oh this one that I'm not operate oh
[1:41:26] great oh it's on maybe okay I think
[1:41:28] you're on right there
[1:41:30] you go right
[1:41:32] um
[1:41:34] I remember if it was last Wednesday hold
[1:41:35] the mic up close sweet uh I think it was
[1:41:38] the Wednesday before
[1:41:39] um
[1:41:40] I gave testimony about uriah's s.a.t
[1:41:43] scores and all of that and I asked you
[1:41:46] all to pray about the scholarship
[1:41:48] um
[1:41:49] and so that was Wednesday
[1:41:54] um Thursday I got a call from the
[1:41:56] gentleman who oversees a scholarship and
[1:42:00] um he said
[1:42:03] um he texted me and said you know when
[1:42:04] you're with Uriah give me a call we have
[1:42:07] an update for you so
[1:42:10] um he called us or we called him when we
[1:42:12] got together and he said that Uriah is
[1:42:15] going to receive a scholarship
[1:42:18] and what I also did not realize is
[1:42:21] apparently if Uriah chooses to go to
[1:42:24] Clemson which he has done
[1:42:26] um
[1:42:27] they have a partnership with that
[1:42:30] particular scholarship that whatever
[1:42:32] that scholarship does not cover in
[1:42:35] addition to other scholarships that he
[1:42:37] gets Clemson will fill in the Gap and
[1:42:39] give him the rest of the funding so he
[1:42:42] got a full ride
[1:42:52] so this means you're going to live in
[1:42:53] Greenville for a while boom
[1:42:58] um
[1:42:59] but you know I prayed that if it was the
[1:43:02] Lord's will that that would
[1:43:03] you know he would open the door and he
[1:43:05] definitely opened the door I also didn't
[1:43:08] get these requests in but we have
[1:43:10] several I have several things that I
[1:43:13] need prayer for
[1:43:15] um one is the dealership has had my car
[1:43:18] for almost a year now
[1:43:20] um trying to do some repairs they had
[1:43:22] neglected it and caused a lot of damage
[1:43:25] to the car and it's all coming to a head
[1:43:27] they're saying that we have to take our
[1:43:29] car back on Friday and turn in the
[1:43:33] loaner and they're just not budging on
[1:43:36] their willingness to
[1:43:38] do what they should do and you know do
[1:43:41] what's right and so we're in a major
[1:43:44] situation with that
[1:43:46] also when we were in North Carolina
[1:43:49] my mom fell and broke her wrist and you
[1:43:54] know she's the primary care for my my
[1:43:57] dad who's also very sick
[1:44:00] and my sister and we just have a lot and
[1:44:05] um
[1:44:10] just needs strength to get through all
[1:44:13] of
[1:44:15] them and I think Mom's gonna have to
[1:44:17] have surgery so I don't know when that
[1:44:19] is but just keep her in prayer
[1:44:25] I had read a brother Brandon quote last
[1:44:27] week and it said that you need to
[1:44:30] confess your healing before it takes
[1:44:32] place and I'm just confessing our baby
[1:44:34] ceiling that she's going to be born
[1:44:37] without a genetic condition and the
[1:44:40] doctors are going to find nothing wrong
[1:44:42] with her heart or her kidneys
[1:44:44] she's not gonna need to hurt surgery and
[1:44:47] we meet with the NICU doctor on Friday
[1:44:49] and I'm claiming now that she's not
[1:44:52] gonna spend any time in the NICU she's
[1:44:54] gonna come home with us and we actually
[1:44:57] decided back in February to name her Zoe
[1:45:00] when we had found out she had these
[1:45:02] issues and sewing means life and we're
[1:45:05] claiming she's gonna have a life and
[1:45:07] it's going to be perfectly normal and
[1:45:09] healthy amen
[1:45:16] any others
[1:45:20] praise the Lord such enjoy this entire
[1:45:23] assembly is claiming that with you 100
[1:45:26] you got a test test one way okay yeah
[1:45:29] amen and Martha
[1:45:32] praying absolutely and hold on to God
[1:45:35] Amen I'm glad that we serve a god
[1:45:39] who can do anything

[1:45:51] I'll get it wrong sure as anything pass
[1:45:53] that back to her right

[1:46:02] cousin was going in for an appeal she's
[1:46:05] in prison made some bad choices and the
[1:46:09] peel they haven't heard from yet but she
