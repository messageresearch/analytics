[39:49] God bless you friends you can be
[39:55] seated
[39:59] it's not
[40:01] working can I pitch a
[40:07] fit
[40:09] okay yeah I think so all right praise
[40:12] the Lord
[40:14] no why I'm not working
[40:21] here on my back amen praise God
[40:28] in our scripture reading and remember
[40:31] that we are hoping to sum up this series
[40:34] today summing up the world near the end
[40:37] today would be part seven and we were
[40:41] told in verse three blessed is he that
[40:49] readeth and keep those things which are
[40:52] written therein for the time is at hand
[40:55] thank you brother the Kenny this
[40:58] particular word keep keep those things
[41:01] this is important today because remember
[41:04] that our theme and I want you to keep
[41:06] remembering this that the theme of this
[41:08] whole series has been the word to live
[41:12] through us so it's it's not merely your
[41:17] verbal testimony how many believe you'd
[41:20] say verbally amen that the message is
[41:23] true and that Christ is real amen we
[41:26] would all say that uh from our lips but
[41:30] does the voice of our
[41:32] life match the testimony of our
[41:36] lips amen so this word keep actually
[41:41] means to guard it means to keep an eye
[41:45] on it means to watch and hence to guard
[41:48] to keep it actually it actually tells
[41:51] you to be a
[41:53] warden to actually enforce make sure
[41:58] that you keep the words of this prophecy
[42:02] keep the things which are written there
[42:04] in for the time is at hand now it so it
[42:08] means to keep it means to obey and here
[42:13] is an interesting segue to Revelation
[42:18] 227 uh brother Mark give me Revelation
[42:21] 227 and when we read this verse you're
[42:25] going to find out it means to
[42:27] particularly to watch observe
[42:30] attentively keep the eyes fixed upon uh
[42:34] keeping for the Fulfillment of Prophecy
[42:38] now in
[42:40] 227 we read it we read this behold I
[42:44] come quickly blessed is he that keepeth
[42:47] there it is again the sayings of this
[42:51] book all right that keepeth the the the
[42:55] sayings of the the prophecy of this book
[42:57] so when we when we find the the Holy
[43:02] Spirit at the beginning of the book of
[43:04] Revelation you believe that's the
[43:06] bride's book absolutely is it its
[43:09] Mysteries where all it came back after
[43:11] Paul was already gone that's why Paul
[43:13] doesn't ever quote from it he was
[43:15] already gone when John come back and it
[43:18] was all written and locked up in symbol
[43:20] and mystery to be revealed and made
[43:23] clear at the end time now it's not that
[43:25] everything at the end time uh that was
[43:28] written in the book would only happen in
[43:30] the end time it would actually happen
[43:32] down Through the Ages but it would be
[43:34] made clear at the end time what God had
[43:38] been doing all along just like that's no
[43:40] different than when brother brandham
[43:42] says that that all the trumpets all the
[43:45] seven trumpets sound under the Sixth
[43:48] Seal and brother brandham is simply
[43:50] meaning that the six seal of course is
[43:52] the Tribulation so all of the trumpets
[43:55] pour out in the their fullness that
[43:57] doesn't stop the fact that they poured
[43:59] out partially down through history amen
[44:03] amen I mean we saw under the trumpets
[44:05] the the the 200 million demon chargers
[44:09] at Euphrates right and they were
[44:12] released and we know that happened in
[44:13] the middle part of the 20th century so
[44:16] it's not that the trumpets haven't had a
[44:18] partial fulfilling just like when the
[44:20] seals every every Church age brother
[44:23] Brenham said a seal was broken partially
[44:26] and a mystery dropped down and a
[44:28] messenger caught it now it wasn't the
[44:30] whole package it was it was God giving
[44:33] enough light for each age to to be able
[44:35] to redeem for them to believe so he
[44:37] could redeem his family even though the
[44:40] church had fallen away and had backslid
[44:43] he still was not going to lose even one
[44:47] of his children thank God so the
[44:50] trumpets are that way they they broke
[44:52] partially the the vials run in in
[44:56] parallel With The Trumpets They
[44:57] correspond to the trumpets if you ever
[44:59] read the trumpets put them in one column
[45:01] put the vials in the next column you'll
[45:03] see that they they they line up
[45:05] perfectly and so so so we realize then
[45:09] that all the trumpets sound under the
[45:11] six seal tribulation in other words they
[45:13] all come to pass in their fullness all
[45:16] right so so when we see this word at the
[45:20] beginning of the book of Revelation keep
[45:23] those things which are written that
[45:26] God has it in mind that the church
[45:30] wasn't going to keep it for no reason
[45:33] they were going to keep it so that they
[45:36] in chapter one so they could arrive at
[45:38] chapter 22 and God could have a family
[45:41] see and so he he at the beginning of the
[45:44] book and at the end of the book he's
[45:46] saying to them again behold I come
[45:48] quickly blessed is he that keepeth the
[45:51] sayings of the prophecy of this book so
[45:53] he's testifying that from from the
[45:56] beginning of the church ages to the
[45:59] consummation of the ages he will have a
[46:03] family who obey who keep who
[46:08] manifest his
[46:10] word does that makes
[46:12] sense you're going to find out that that
[46:16] above all other things is the marker
[46:20] that is the that is the evidence uh of
[46:24] who his true family are is that family
[46:28] who from chapter 1 to chapter 20 through
[46:31] 2,000 years will always say not just
[46:35] from their lips but in their life
[46:38] will'll say Amen to every
[46:41] word is that clear so this is why
[46:45] brother Brandon would say that puts
[46:47] denominations out of the picture
[46:49] completely because why because when the
[46:53] when the word came and the messenger
[46:56] went home they built that denomination
[46:59] on the on the on the Shadows of the
[47:02] previous movement and when the new when
[47:04] another seal broke and another messenger
[47:07] went forward they would not move on with
[47:10] the word so they in effect although they
[47:12] were admitting to the to the work of
[47:15] Calvary they were not confessing or
[47:18] agreeing in their testimony or in their
[47:22] lives they stopped saying Amen to every
[47:27] word so it puts out organized religion
[47:31] completely no wonder brother Brandon
[47:33] would come at the end of the ages and
[47:36] say to the church and I guess he had the
[47:39] authority he was the angel to the last
[47:41] age and he would say he's the signifying
[47:45] Angel John he's he's John's tour guide
[47:49] John tries to worship him several times
[47:51] and he keeps making it clear I'm just
[47:53] one of the prophets don't worship me he
[47:56] a true a sign of a true Prophet is he
[47:59] always re reverses worship back to God
[48:02] see he will never take it on on himself
[48:06] and so he so this was a sign of a true
[48:08] Prophet I'm so glad that Jesus Christ is
[48:11] the same yesterday day and forever so
[48:13] that you don't have to worry about how
[48:15] he would act today you don't have to try
[48:17] to figure that out all you have to do is
[48:19] read how he acted in a previous day when
[48:22] he was here on the earth and how he
[48:24] lived and how he conducted himself is
[48:27] exactly how he will live and conduct
[48:29] himself in the hour that we live in
[48:31] that's how you identify
[48:33] him you're going to find out I'm going
[48:35] to make the statement it's somewhere
[48:36] down in my notes I remember that it is
[48:39] the manifestation of the word that is
[48:43] the evidence of the new birth and it
[48:45] always has
[48:46] been it because it that's what proves
[48:49] Hebrews 13 and8 is when the ink on paper
[48:53] lives behind skin
[48:56] all right I'm going slow on purpose all
[48:59] right brother Mark let's have my my
[49:03] slides now I'm going to read through
[49:05] these and we're we're not going to take
[49:08] too much time I'm not going to do like
[49:09] Katie said and start freestyling so
[49:11] we're gonna just try to keep it keep
[49:13] keep going here let me turn my Gizmo on
[49:16] so summing up the world near the end
[49:18] part seven the time is at hand all right
[49:23] so brother Brenham says here now now
[49:26] listen friends the the reason that that
[49:29] I want to read these quotes is because I
[49:31] want you to have confidence in what I'm
[49:34] saying because I'm not pulling this out
[49:36] of thin air I'm I'm this is the the
[49:39] advantage you have this is the advantage
[49:42] you have in not just sitting at home
[49:44] playing this tape you have a minister
[49:47] that God has called you to sit under who
[49:49] can rightly divide and take these quotes
[49:52] with the scriptures and and and Stitch
[49:54] it into the fabric of your life and make
[49:56] and run alongside you that's the
[49:59] advantage of a true Shepherd he can run
[50:01] alongside you and and he can reach over
[50:04] while you're running through life and he
[50:06] can make changes without breaking stride
[50:09] without breaking your stride see so so
[50:12] so that's what we're attempting to do
[50:15] today all right so he says
[50:19] here the Bible is not a book of systems
[50:23] now really pay close attention this is
[50:25] this is 1965 this some of the last
[50:28] things the Lord wanted us to understand
[50:30] before his messenger goes home the Bible
[50:33] is not a book of systems no no sir it is
[50:36] not a book of systems nor a code of
[50:40] morals the Bible is not a book of
[50:43] systems so many systems and so forth no
[50:46] sir it is not a book of morals no sir it
[50:49] is not nor is it a book of History
[50:53] altogether or neither is is it a book of
[50:57] theology now it contains all of that but
[51:01] that's not its primary thing all right
[51:03] it is the revelation of Jesus Christ so
[51:09] the Bible is the complete revelation of
[51:13] Jesus Christ and it was wrote by
[51:16] prophets Hebrews 1:1 God who in Sundry
[51:20] times spake to the fathers by the
[51:24] prophets in this last day speaks to us
[51:28] through his son Jesus Christ which was
[51:32] the prophets all of them put together
[51:35] isn't that an amazing word it's all of
[51:39] them put together all right oh excuse me
[51:44] so Jesus was Malachi Jesus was Jeremiah
[51:49] Isaiah
[51:51] Elijah all that they were were in him
[51:56] and all that you are and all I am is in
[52:02] him words Witnesses of the
[52:06] word amen so so when when you look at it
[52:11] that way I mean listen friends I if this
[52:15] was all
[52:16] true before as he reads here you know
[52:20] the word was in Malachi so Jesus was in
[52:22] Malachi in other words Jesus was living
[52:25] in Isaiah Jesus was living in Malachi
[52:28] Jesus was living in Elijah if that was
[52:31] all true before the Lamb of God was even
[52:36] slain how much more is it
[52:39] today amen if it was true before the
[52:43] Holy Ghost came how much then what do
[52:46] you have available to you today say this
[52:49] is a terrible day but look at what's
[52:51] available to
[52:53] you see
[52:56] so it's not a a book of systems code a
[52:59] code of morals and he goes on here
[53:02] watch so it's not a book of systems a
[53:05] code of moral ethics neither is it a
[53:09] history book or a book of theology it is
[53:12] not but it is the revelation of of Jesus
[53:14] Christ God himself revealed from word to
[53:19] flesh from word to
[53:22] flesh amen that's what it was in Malachi
[53:26] that's what it was in Elijah that's what
[53:28] it was in brother M says that that
[53:31] Jeremiah was Christ in another different
[53:33] quote see because Christ means the
[53:36] anointed word I say Christ you
[53:38] immediately think of Jesus of Nazareth
[53:40] and you'd be right but that's not the
[53:41] only time Christ is applied Christ is
[53:44] applied any time the word is made flesh
[53:46] that's Christ that Christ means an
[53:49] anointed anointed word so whatever is
[53:52] the word The Living Word of that hour
[53:55] that's that's why the Bible could say
[53:56] that Moses was a God to the people yet
[54:00] he wasn't God but he was a God to the
[54:02] people because he was the anointed word
[54:05] of that hour see so you know theologians
[54:09] can argue all they want to with Kentucky
[54:12] Hill belly but they could not deny what
[54:15] he was saying because it was right in
[54:17] the scriptures see so so we find out
[54:21] then he says
[54:22] here it's a revelation of Jes Jesus
[54:25] Christ God himself revealed from word to
[54:28] flesh that's what it is the Bible is the
[54:31] word and God is the flesh God in the
[54:34] word rather and Jesus being the flesh
[54:39] it's the
[54:41] Revelation how God the word was
[54:44] manifested in human flesh and revealed
[54:47] to us and that's why we become a Son of
[54:54] God he he is a part of God you
[54:57] understand now he the body is part of
[54:59] God so much that it's his son so so when
[55:04] we're so so when we're reading the and
[55:08] i' I've been showing you this and I'm
[55:10] going to I'm gonna I'm going to nail it
[55:12] down again today when you're when you're
[55:15] reading the established word of God from
[55:21] history when you're reading the
[55:24] establish word as history that's not the
[55:29] same as reading the history that George
[55:32] Washington crossed the
[55:35] Delaware that's not going to inspire you
[55:37] to do anything you'll read that story
[55:40] and you go my goodness what a brave
[55:42] bunch of men that was and they got they
[55:44] got across the Delaware and we tell the
[55:45] story and they broke the ice and got
[55:47] across and surprised the hessan uh
[55:49] mercenaries who England had there and
[55:51] got a great Victory but that's not going
[55:54] to
[55:55] it wouldn't matter if I got a boat and
[55:57] cross of Delaware that's not going to
[55:58] get me closer to heaven
[56:01] right so so so brother Brandon would say
[56:04] this isn't just
[56:06] history see it's not not the same kind
[56:09] there's nothing about reading that story
[56:12] that will of George Washington that will
[56:14] that will cause you to become a further
[56:17] manifestation of that event you follow
[56:20] me you're not going to be a continuation
[56:23] of that because you read about George
[56:26] Washington doing it see so the word of
[56:29] God then now you can get it the word of
[56:32] God is more than just morals it's more
[56:35] than just history it's more than just
[56:38] theology it's a Living Word of God and
[56:42] it's designed to live in and operate
[56:47] through human flesh
[56:50] am that's why Jesus was a human see he
[56:54] was the beginning of the creation of God
[56:57] you're the
[56:58] continuation of that same creation so so
[57:03] it's it's always been designed to live
[57:06] behind the skin of God's Masterpiece
[57:09] creation say what's his Masterpiece
[57:11] creation Sons and Daughters of his
[57:13] kingdom see all down through the ages to
[57:16] the present age to right now and in the
[57:19] ages to come without end this has always
[57:23] been when brother Brandon said it like
[57:26] this when the books are closed for the
[57:30] last time the word will be
[57:34] flesh there's coming a day when they'll
[57:36] open The Book of Life at the Judgment
[57:39] bar and they'll open the books and the
[57:43] people will be judged out of the books
[57:45] and the and the Book of Life will be the
[57:47] final
[57:48] Arbiter and and if your name is is
[57:51] blotted out of that you have no chance
[57:54] if your name is is in it then you'll get
[57:55] a fair trial and you might make it in
[57:58] see everybody will get a fair trial
[58:00] thank God you know it all you say well
[58:03] what about people who who you know God
[58:06] knew them for their very purpose and
[58:07] like Pharaoh I've raised you up all
[58:09] listen friends all the all that is all
[58:11] the scripture is showing you there is
[58:13] that God by his forn knowledge knows who
[58:16] will and who won't now we're not talking
[58:18] about his elected family that's a whole
[58:20] different section of the book he's got a
[58:23] a a a a section of election that covers
[58:27] his gened family and then he's got the
[58:30] rest of it to cover everybody else
[58:33] that's ever lived in the Earth ever
[58:35] breathed air and God knowing the end
[58:37] from the beginning it's not hard for him
[58:39] to predestinate knowing who wouldn't he
[58:42] and who wouldn't he didn't force anyone
[58:43] he gives Every Man a legit
[58:46] opportunity but he knows who will and
[58:48] who won't see if if he doesn't know that
[58:51] he's how could he even be God so you
[58:53] you're never going to impune him you
[58:55] can't that's why I've said to you many
[58:58] times no one at the Judgment bar when
[58:59] you whether you read it in Matthew 25 or
[59:01] whether you read it in the Book of
[59:02] Revelation no one is crying foul holding
[59:05] signs or
[59:06] marching see so so because there's
[59:10] something about being in that presence
[59:12] that there's a knowing that you that you
[59:14] know you know what you are that's what I
[59:16] love about church oh I can come in here
[59:19] and get under the presence of God and
[59:20] sometimes if I think I'm I'm all right
[59:22] and I'm a pretty good guy and then the
[59:24] preach can get in the pull pit and I
[59:26] realize my need of God I say oh Lord
[59:29] help me today see and so this is why I I
[59:35] feel sorry for people who sit at home uh
[59:39] and just play tapes that you know the
[59:41] reason people do that playing tapes is a
[59:42] wonderful thing we're for that I love
[59:44] that you should do that every day I just
[59:47] said recently a tape a day will keep the
[59:49] devil away so nobody believes in
[59:52] listening to tapes more than me but do
[59:53] you know do you know I'm going to tell
[59:55] you something friends you know why the
[59:57] vast majority the vast majority I'm I'm
[59:59] not authorized to say every single
[1:00:01] person I can't judge everybody's Hearts
[1:00:03] but I know by the patterns of the word
[1:00:06] having studied it more more you know
[1:00:09] three quarters of my life I can see the
[1:00:11] patterns and the reason that people stay
[1:00:14] home and listen to tapes is because
[1:00:15] that's what they want to
[1:00:18] do that's the reason they don't go to
[1:00:21] church is because they don't want to and
[1:00:24] that's just the sad truth I'm going say
[1:00:27] it again the reason they don't go to
[1:00:29] church the reason that that that
[1:00:32] somebody was able to convince them even
[1:00:36] though brother brandham never taught
[1:00:37] that and they they they teach it in the
[1:00:40] name of brother Brandon but he never
[1:00:41] taught that and there's no quotes to
[1:00:43] support it and there's certainly no
[1:00:44] scripture to support it but somebody
[1:00:47] remember when I told you that if you go
[1:00:49] long enough time you'll look around to
[1:00:52] find you a version of The Gospel that
[1:00:54] you want to be true and people who don't
[1:00:57] want to go to church and don't want a
[1:00:59] responsibility of having a pastor who
[1:01:01] don't want to be responsible to other
[1:01:03] people who don't want to be in that kind
[1:01:05] of a mix because that takes something
[1:01:08] and people who don't want to do that
[1:01:09] finally let her someone told them what
[1:01:12] they wanted to
[1:01:14] hear and therefore they don't go to
[1:01:16] church and they don't have a local
[1:01:17] pastor and they don't mingle with a
[1:01:19] local with with the saints of God
[1:01:22] because they don't want to
[1:01:25] and they've allowed someone to convince
[1:01:26] them contrary to the scripture and
[1:01:28] contrary to the message that they can do
[1:01:30] that say what's going to be their fith
[1:01:32] that's not for me to judge I I certainly
[1:01:35] believe that there are Sons and
[1:01:36] Daughters of God Amen all through that
[1:01:39] movement I certainly agree with that I
[1:01:41] would by no means condemn the people I'm
[1:01:44] just saying that that's a false teaching
[1:01:47] and it's a false anointing and and if it
[1:01:50] really loved the people it would tell
[1:01:52] them what the word of God says amen
[1:01:55] enough of enough of that's not even my
[1:01:57] notes that's free God bless you on the
[1:01:59] internet if you turn it off
[1:02:04] okay all right so brother brandham goes
[1:02:07] on
[1:02:09] here all
[1:02:11] right and all the scripture is divinely
[1:02:15] given divinely set in order and the
[1:02:19] whole thing is a revelation of Jesus
[1:02:22] Christ the new and old
[1:02:24] Testament where they foretold of him
[1:02:28] coming what he would do when he got here
[1:02:31] and what he would do in the age to come
[1:02:35] that beautiful so that makes him the
[1:02:40] same yesterday today and forever see all
[1:02:45] right uh like in Hebrews there when Paul
[1:02:49] wrote it he is God Jesus Christ
[1:02:52] yesterday of the Old Testament he's
[1:02:54] Jesus Christ today manifested in the
[1:02:57] flesh and he's Jesus Christ forever in
[1:03:01] the spirit to come see same yesterday
[1:03:04] today and forever and he ever lives to
[1:03:08] make his word live what it said it would
[1:03:11] do for that age he is alive now he's
[1:03:15] alive he's living in you and me we have
[1:03:19] a particular age you're not living in a
[1:03:21] different age you're living in this one
[1:03:23] and you say my I I just sometimes I
[1:03:25] can't I can't seem to cause the word to
[1:03:29] live out of me like it should I'm here
[1:03:31] to tell you you you
[1:03:33] can maybe you're not the Bible says that
[1:03:37] there's no temptation taken you but such
[1:03:39] as is common to man but within that
[1:03:42] Temptation God will make a way for you
[1:03:44] to escape now he doesn't say you'll take
[1:03:47] it he just says I'll Make A Way whether
[1:03:50] you take it or not that's on you see but
[1:03:53] I'm here to take it I just say Lord let
[1:03:55] me take all of your word because I know
[1:03:59] that you're here I'm alive which means
[1:04:01] you're alive and we're here and that and
[1:04:03] I know that a prophet is saying that he
[1:04:05] ever lives to make his word live what it
[1:04:09] said it would be for that age and I just
[1:04:11] say Lord no matter what you have to do
[1:04:14] by whatever means necessary cause this
[1:04:17] vessel to look like this
[1:04:20] Bible amen see so he he's there whatever
[1:04:26] it said it would do for that age he is
[1:04:29] alive so here is the point that I was
[1:04:31] making to earlier so a manifestation of
[1:04:35] the scripture proves Hebrews
[1:04:38] 138 when you're living the life of the
[1:04:42] word you're proving that Jesus Christ is
[1:04:46] the same yesterday today and forever see
[1:04:49] so his proof of
[1:04:52] existence is his creation
[1:04:55] manifesting his word that make sense
[1:04:58] going to say it again his proof of
[1:05:02] existance he said brother brandham said
[1:05:04] in the quote he is alive he's here in
[1:05:07] this age well then his proof of
[1:05:10] existence in his is him in his creation
[1:05:14] making the word live when you are
[1:05:16] allowing the word to live through you
[1:05:19] you're proving he's
[1:05:21] alive see so this would literally serve
[1:05:27] as a model of vindication going forward
[1:05:29] Forever This is actually the reality of
[1:05:32] Hebrews 138 it's a major point that gets
[1:05:36] overlooked because too often times we
[1:05:38] want to prove Hebrews 138 by
[1:05:41] Doctrine now that's that's you say well
[1:05:43] what's so wrong with that it's not wrong
[1:05:45] but it's too
[1:05:46] easy because first of all the devil can
[1:05:48] do it better than you can right but what
[1:05:51] he can't do is reproduce that life
[1:05:54] I'm doing something he can't do greater
[1:05:57] is he that's in me than he that's in the
[1:06:00] world he can preach this same message
[1:06:03] that I can he can understand it as good
[1:06:05] as I can he was wiser than Daniel but he
[1:06:08] can't reproduce the life you have more
[1:06:12] power than his
[1:06:15] power
[1:06:16] see so this is exactly what God was
[1:06:21] doing at auua for the Manifest St ation
[1:06:24] of that day it was a restoration of the
[1:06:27] power that that came out of the upper
[1:06:30] room experience and brother Brenham said
[1:06:31] it had waned uh but God was bringing it
[1:06:34] back so the that listen friends that's
[1:06:38] what was going on when
[1:06:41] 30,000 converts were giving their life
[1:06:44] to Christ and smashing Idols in Durban
[1:06:48] 30,000 at once smash their Idols
[1:06:52] 25,000 I didn't hear William brandom say
[1:06:54] this I heard FF Bosworth say this on a
[1:06:57] tape he said we had
[1:07:01] 25,000 miraculous healings in One Moment
[1:07:04] In One prayer it blew his mind he said I
[1:07:07] never knew that could even happen he
[1:07:09] said I always thought all you could do
[1:07:11] is you if you wanted 25,000 healings you
[1:07:13] had to pray for 25,000 people he said it
[1:07:15] never occurred to me to do what William
[1:07:17] brandom did he said he got up and prayed
[1:07:19] for everybody and 25,000 people notable
[1:07:22] miracles
[1:07:24] see so so this is exactly what God was
[1:07:28] doing he was proving his word for that
[1:07:32] age say we aren't having that kind of
[1:07:34] meetings today that's CA our age isn't
[1:07:36] that age see our age is something
[1:07:39] different our ages it doesn't come so
[1:07:42] much with observation it's in secret but
[1:07:45] what's happening God is perfecting a
[1:07:47] bride right under the nose of Satan in
[1:07:50] his
[1:07:51] Eden see it was the commission that
[1:07:53] further brandham received from the angel
[1:07:56] in 1946 and he took it to the world but
[1:07:59] it but listen friends that was you say
[1:08:02] my if we just had all those days that
[1:08:04] was all just background to the third
[1:08:08] pole that was just background to what
[1:08:11] God is doing in this hour that you know
[1:08:15] the third poll begins of course with the
[1:08:17] opening of the seals and what does it do
[1:08:20] what's what's what's the word portion of
[1:08:22] the third pool cuz there's the
[1:08:24] miraculous there's the spoken word
[1:08:25] portion of it but what is the word
[1:08:28] portion of the third pole it's releasing
[1:08:31] back to his family the original
[1:08:36] word no more is it mongrelized or
[1:08:40] hybridized no more is it misunderstood
[1:08:43] even by the seventh angel who at first
[1:08:47] thought it was
[1:08:48] love amen at first he thought love is
[1:08:52] the greatest but he had to get corrected
[1:08:54] on that he and he said no the greatest
[1:08:56] evidence is saying Amen to the word
[1:09:00] listen friends you're not following the
[1:09:02] ministry of a man you're following the
[1:09:04] ministry of the son of
[1:09:06] man this is the portion of the third
[1:09:09] pole that's open to us the word the
[1:09:12] world that we live in I you know I could
[1:09:16] stand here today and take a long time
[1:09:18] just to talk about the elements of sin
[1:09:21] in the world and the the the the turmoil
[1:09:25] that's going on and the wars and famine
[1:09:27] but I'm not a newsman you can read the
[1:09:30] headlines yourself uh what I'm here to
[1:09:32] point out is that the world had to
[1:09:35] arrive in the condition of Luke 17 it
[1:09:39] was always going to come to this it was
[1:09:41] always going to hit the days of
[1:09:44] Noah it was always going to repeat the
[1:09:47] days of lot that was the Gospel going
[1:09:50] forward in the Ages was never going to
[1:09:52] stop that from happening
[1:09:54] happening see so brother Bram goes on
[1:09:57] all right so the Jews had to be
[1:10:00] repositioned under the trumpets because
[1:10:03] why why why did that have to happen
[1:10:05] because they've got to have their
[1:10:07] Day of Reconciliation to God with the
[1:10:11] blindness
[1:10:12] removed so what what did it take to get
[1:10:15] them into their Homeland whatever it
[1:10:17] took that's whatever it took and you say
[1:10:20] what is it going to take to keep them
[1:10:21] there so that they can receive I'm here
[1:10:23] to take something they can sing from the
[1:10:25] rivers to the Sea all they want to sing
[1:10:28] they can chant it they can chant the
[1:10:30] intifa and the annihilation of Jews and
[1:10:33] as a people but I'm here to tell you
[1:10:36] when Moses and Elijah come on the scene
[1:10:39] 144,000 are still going to be right
[1:10:41] there in that land and nobody's going to
[1:10:45] move them they're not even
[1:10:51] killable they're they don't even maybe
[1:10:53] know know it at this moment but they
[1:10:55] already have Immortal Life they can't
[1:10:58] even be
[1:11:01] destroyed they've got to be there
[1:11:05] Hallelujah that's the power of the word
[1:11:07] of God oh you can put your confidence in
[1:11:10] it there's nothing that can overcome
[1:11:13] God's
[1:11:14] word and if it's in you then nothing can
[1:11:17] overcome you I don't care I don't care
[1:11:19] how much up and down success the devil
[1:11:22] wants to that he has in my life and your
[1:11:25] life and he
[1:11:27] does it ain't going to stop me from
[1:11:30] being crowned with
[1:11:31] Christ
[1:11:34] Hallelujah so is this clear is this
[1:11:37] clear so let's let's go a little further
[1:11:39] all right so brother Brenham says he was
[1:11:43] alive in the Old Testament manifested
[1:11:45] watch when Jesus was manifested in the
[1:11:47] Old Testament as we believe it when
[1:11:49] Jesus was manifested in the Old
[1:11:52] Testament in a theophany in the person
[1:11:54] of
[1:11:55] MDC not a priesthood but a person the
[1:11:59] man see for this man had yet not been
[1:12:02] born but he was in a theophany it was
[1:12:06] Jesus in a theophany in the form of a
[1:12:08] man he says can you go with that all
[1:12:11] right all right can you go with
[1:12:13] that let me keep up with myself here all
[1:12:16] right we're going slow then when he was
[1:12:19] made actually human flesh and and uh
[1:12:23] dwelt Among Us in the person of Jesus
[1:12:26] Christ himself born of the Virgin Mary
[1:12:29] see they're the same guy the same person
[1:12:32] MDC and a theophany and Jesus born of
[1:12:34] Mary is the same person all right just
[1:12:38] he's now he's now the only begotten of
[1:12:41] the father because he's born of a woman
[1:12:44] all right so now watch so he's born of
[1:12:47] the Virgin Mary he come in that form so
[1:12:50] he could die because you can't you can't
[1:12:53] brother Brandon would describe it like
[1:12:55] this he explain it like this God can't
[1:12:57] die God's a spirit you can't kill god
[1:13:00] brother Bram said so God acted out the
[1:13:03] part of death in Christ now he said he
[1:13:06] didn't act he really did die Jesus
[1:13:09] really did die but Jesus was the body
[1:13:12] that God lived in brother brandham said
[1:13:14] it's so simple why do they make it so
[1:13:16] complicated see all
[1:13:19] right so he says
[1:13:22] um
[1:13:24] and then he was made actually human
[1:13:26] flesh and dwelt Among Us in the person
[1:13:28] of Jesus Christ himself born of the
[1:13:29] Virgin Mary he come in that form him so
[1:13:31] he could die and went back into heaven
[1:13:34] now in this last days he was promised to
[1:13:38] manifest himself in the fullness again
[1:13:42] of his flesh in spirit you say now wait
[1:13:46] a minute is this meaning when he comes
[1:13:49] back to Earth in Revelation 19 well he
[1:13:52] certainly Coming Back In the Flesh in
[1:13:54] Revelation 19 but the beauty of what
[1:13:58] William brandham is trying to get the
[1:14:00] world to understand that what he was
[1:14:02] promising in Luke 17 when you see the
[1:14:06] days of Noah repeat and we do and when
[1:14:09] you see the days of lot repeat and we
[1:14:11] have it then that's the time that's the
[1:14:14] time not at the end of the tribulation
[1:14:17] that's the time before the Rapture that
[1:14:20] Jesus Christ would come to the Earth in
[1:14:22] flesh again again and and he's living in
[1:14:26] you and
[1:14:27] me he's in his church just like he was
[1:14:31] at the beginning of the church see all
[1:14:35] right you're getting it I'm sure you're
[1:14:37] getting
[1:14:42] it Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:14:46] the son of man now I want to make a
[1:14:49] point
[1:14:51] because a lot of even what I'm teaching
[1:14:53] you already
[1:14:54] know so now it's going to be my job and
[1:14:57] as I'm going along I'm dropping in
[1:15:01] application we've already done it a
[1:15:03] little bit but I'm dropping I'm going to
[1:15:05] drop in some more application because
[1:15:06] you can you can sit at home and hear
[1:15:08] this tape all right but now watch let's
[1:15:11] so so keep your mind with me all right
[1:15:13] don't miss don't miss those nuggets that
[1:15:15] are coming all right for as it was in
[1:15:17] the days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[1:15:19] coming of the son of man now look at the
[1:15:22] Sodom how it's set and what taken place
[1:15:26] and Jesus Christ being manifested in
[1:15:28] bodily form of his church today so am I
[1:15:31] am I off in left field see so he's in
[1:15:35] bodily form of his church today see
[1:15:39] doing the same thing same work same
[1:15:42] things that he did all the time never
[1:15:46] changes the Eternal one you say are you
[1:15:50] walking on water brother Jason and
[1:15:52] multiplying fish I'm doing something far
[1:15:55] greater than either one of
[1:15:56] those when he multiplied fish in loaves
[1:15:59] that attracted a people who only came
[1:16:01] for the Fish and
[1:16:03] Loaves you say what about walking on
[1:16:05] water if the Lord ever needed me to walk
[1:16:07] on water I'd walk right out there on
[1:16:09] it you see but the then then what is it
[1:16:13] that you're doing that's greater like
[1:16:15] Christ I'm trying my best to do always
[1:16:18] that which pleases the
[1:16:20] father that's what I'm doing I'm trying
[1:16:23] trying to be the word and whatever he
[1:16:25] needs me to be maybe he only needs a
[1:16:29] housewife to be a loyal housewife maybe
[1:16:32] he needs a man to travel a Seven Seas
[1:16:35] maybe he needs people to come to church
[1:16:36] and amen the word of God who just work
[1:16:39] jobs and have families and take
[1:16:40] vacations and and and support a church
[1:16:43] maybe that's what he needs you're doing
[1:16:45] the greatest thing you're doing what God
[1:16:47] has called you to
[1:16:49] do see the the opening of the word word
[1:16:53] is what has allowed us to do that you
[1:16:56] say well well why is that so great why
[1:17:00] is that so great you mean besides the
[1:17:02] fact that eight billion other people
[1:17:04] aren't doing
[1:17:06] it I mean how much greater you
[1:17:09] want see almost eight billion other
[1:17:13] people aren't doing that we're doing it
[1:17:16] blessed be the name of the Lord not
[1:17:19] because you're better than them but
[1:17:20] because you have said amen you have
[1:17:23] believed his word you have
[1:17:26] allowed his word to take effect in your
[1:17:30] life I I I I wish the desire of my heart
[1:17:35] would just be to preach just that for
[1:17:36] the rest of my time is just to talk
[1:17:39] about allowing the word to dwell in you
[1:17:45] richly I'd love to take the rest of my
[1:17:48] time and just talk about letting the
[1:17:50] mind which was in Christ be in you you
[1:17:54] oh my I want to finish up this series
[1:17:57] God
[1:17:59] willing all right let's see where we are
[1:18:02] all right
[1:18:03] so he goes
[1:18:05] on and upon Earth
[1:18:08] today he has manifested himself in the
[1:18:12] human bodies
[1:18:15] who our human bodies that he has called
[1:18:19] and done exactly the same thing he done
[1:18:22] in sunry times and in the times of the
[1:18:26] of his flesh upon the Earth so you
[1:18:28] remember we've been taking Hebrews 1 in
[1:18:31] Sundre time he spoke through prophets in
[1:18:34] the middle of the Old and New Testament
[1:18:36] he was a keystone and spoke through
[1:18:38] Jesus Christ and in the New Testament
[1:18:40] he's back in his many membered body he
[1:18:43] on the on the day of Pentecost it went
[1:18:45] from one Jesus to
[1:18:48] 120 and within hours it went to
[1:18:51] 3,000 and within days it was thousands
[1:18:54] more and God just kept adding Jesus
[1:18:57] Christ to the church daily as he would
[1:19:00] and they continued in the apostles
[1:19:03] Doctrine and the breaking of bread amen
[1:19:05] that's the sign of the true church it
[1:19:08] always has been those who follow all of
[1:19:11] his word without denying any part of it
[1:19:14] that's not just Doctrine that's that's a
[1:19:17] people that do not deny God his
[1:19:20] privilege to live his life through them
[1:19:24] Amen in case that went over your head
[1:19:27] it's not just denying doctrinal teaching
[1:19:30] you might misund understand teaching and
[1:19:31] deny it that wouldn't send you to hell
[1:19:33] you can't disbelieve what you don't know
[1:19:35] and since sin is real Sin is unbelief
[1:19:38] you can't disbelieve what you don't know
[1:19:40] you just ask God to make it clear that's
[1:19:41] not what we're talking about we're
[1:19:43] talking about when the Holy Ghost is
[1:19:45] calling upon you for Holiness and
[1:19:47] separateness from the world and you
[1:19:49] won't do that it's calling you a prophet
[1:19:53] is screaming out make Jesus the center
[1:19:55] of your life and you won't do that he's
[1:19:58] saying he needs to be first in your life
[1:20:00] and you make him second third fourth or
[1:20:03] fifth then then then you're not taking a
[1:20:06] stand for the word doesn't matter what
[1:20:08] you believe
[1:20:11] intellectually
[1:20:15] amen all
[1:20:17] right all right so he's done in Sun
[1:20:20] Times and and in the times of his flesh
[1:20:22] upon on the earth and doing the same
[1:20:25] thing
[1:20:26] today because God In sunnd Time spoke to
[1:20:29] the fathers through the prophets in this
[1:20:33] last days through his son Jesus Christ
[1:20:35] see the son being revealed in the last
[1:20:38] days God manifested in human flesh
[1:20:42] setting Just Before sodom's Destruction
[1:20:46] the end of the Gentile world do you see
[1:20:51] it do you see see
[1:20:53] it are you sure you see
[1:20:57] it do you see it in real time happening
[1:21:01] around you do you see Sodom going to
[1:21:04] destruction do you see what what is it
[1:21:07] you see brother Brandon preached the
[1:21:09] message look what are you looking at you
[1:21:11] say my goodness brother you know uh why
[1:21:14] why you emphasizing it because depending
[1:21:16] on what you see that informs your
[1:21:19] thinking as to what you should be doing
[1:21:22] see
[1:21:23] and what your life and your dedication
[1:21:25] to God should look like when I see
[1:21:29] people who who come right into this
[1:21:31] church and believe the same message I
[1:21:33] believe but I don't see the word having
[1:21:36] preeminence in their life then they
[1:21:38] don't see it they might see the message
[1:21:41] but they don't see the what's happening
[1:21:43] in the world if they did it would drive
[1:21:46] them to their knees they would think
[1:21:48] about their children walking around in
[1:21:50] this dark world and they wouldn't let go
[1:21:52] of God until they were filled with the
[1:21:54] Holy
[1:21:56] Ghost they wouldn't let their career
[1:21:58] interfere with that they wouldn't let
[1:22:00] school or work or jobs or anything they
[1:22:03] wouldn't let Recreation they wouldn't
[1:22:05] let vacations they wouldn't let anything
[1:22:08] interfere if they really saw
[1:22:13] it in real time happening around
[1:22:17] you see if you see it then what should
[1:22:21] you be doing
[1:22:25] if you see it if you see Luke
[1:22:28] 17 if you see the days of Noah and you
[1:22:30] believe it and you see the days of lot
[1:22:33] and you believe it and you can see and
[1:22:36] you can observe and and on the fact that
[1:22:40] the world is vile and full of sin and
[1:22:42] it's Satan's Eden if you can see that
[1:22:45] then what should your life and
[1:22:47] dedication to God look like I don't need
[1:22:50] anybody to write me a note or tell me or
[1:22:52] stand up or raise a hand ask yourself
[1:22:55] right now if I really see the world in
[1:22:59] the condition that it's actually in then
[1:23:02] what should my life look like what
[1:23:05] should my prayer life look like what
[1:23:07] should my home life look like what
[1:23:09] should my activities look like what
[1:23:11] should my Recreation look like what
[1:23:13] should I be feeding
[1:23:16] on
[1:23:18] Amen you know there's much wondered at
[1:23:23] concerning the little wooden room
[1:23:25] brother brandom I'm not going to take
[1:23:27] the time today to
[1:23:30] uh read the quotes of that story you're
[1:23:32] familiar with it brother brandom said I
[1:23:34] was in something like a big tent in one
[1:23:37] place in another place he called it a
[1:23:38] big
[1:23:39] Cathedral so I don't think we're trying
[1:23:41] to look for some canvas built tent on
[1:23:45] five or 10 or 50 or a million polls
[1:23:48] somehow that the bride is all going to
[1:23:49] meet under it hey if that happens I'll
[1:23:52] be on the front
[1:23:54] row I promise you I'll be right on the
[1:23:56] front row but that's not what I'm
[1:23:58] looking for I'm not you know you say
[1:24:00] well that's you should be shocked well
[1:24:02] brother brandham said I'm not even
[1:24:03] looking for Revival he said I'm looking
[1:24:05] for the coming of the
[1:24:07] Lord I'm not I'm I'm you know the the
[1:24:10] reason the world misses the the word of
[1:24:13] the hour you know the the main reason
[1:24:15] they miss the word of the hour because
[1:24:17] they're looking for the nail scarred
[1:24:19] man and they don't see him until the
[1:24:22] into the
[1:24:23] tribulation he doesn't come back until
[1:24:25] Revelation 19 his feet never touch this
[1:24:27] Earth and because they're looking for
[1:24:29] the nail scar man now that's why they
[1:24:31] don't see him in the form of his
[1:24:34] word see they join a church and just
[1:24:37] wait it
[1:24:38] out there's much wondered at where he
[1:24:41] said I was up there and he said that
[1:24:42] little light he said it's to my right
[1:24:44] and there was a little wooden room and
[1:24:47] he said the the angel of the Lord he
[1:24:50] said that Pillar of Fire he said it left
[1:24:51] me and it went down into that room and
[1:24:53] he said as it was going he said I'll
[1:24:56] meet you in there and brother brandham
[1:24:59] called behind him why and he called back
[1:25:03] because it won't be a public show and he
[1:25:06] went in and brother brandham describes
[1:25:09] how that a prayer line is formed and
[1:25:12] people are coming to that line and you
[1:25:15] know people went in and the pillar of
[1:25:17] fire was in there and people came out
[1:25:19] the backside
[1:25:21] hole right and when they were even
[1:25:23] asking the people what happened in there
[1:25:25] brother brandham said the people were
[1:25:27] saying I don't
[1:25:28] know I I don't know I I went in I had a
[1:25:31] need I'm out my need is met I went in
[1:25:34] sick I'm now I'm whole I went in Bound
[1:25:36] now I'm delivered I went in oh I'm GNA
[1:25:38] tell you something friends I guess it
[1:25:40] was from whatever was hindering them
[1:25:41] whether it was physical or whether it
[1:25:44] was emotional or whether it was mental I
[1:25:47] mean listen we don't know precisely what
[1:25:49] it all means just before the Crossing
[1:25:52] over but but I do know that there is
[1:25:55] something just ahead of us I can tell
[1:25:58] you friends I I I can't put every Peg
[1:26:01] together for you we don't have the whole
[1:26:02] picture it's going to manifest itself
[1:26:05] but I know that it's happening now and I
[1:26:08] know that it's going to get greater and
[1:26:10] greater
[1:26:12] Hallelujah life I mean think about when
[1:26:14] they go through there I thought about
[1:26:16] this my wife and I were talking about it
[1:26:18] life
[1:26:21] unencumbered
[1:26:23] what a wonderful
[1:26:25] thing I mean sometimes you know people
[1:26:28] say
[1:26:30] well you know I I I might say you know I
[1:26:33] love
[1:26:34] life I love life and sometimes people
[1:26:38] could say well if you had my life you
[1:26:41] wouldn't love life my life is horrible
[1:26:44] well but but come on that's you're only
[1:26:47] thinking that because you're
[1:26:49] suffering if I just took the suffering
[1:26:51] away you wouldn't think like that life
[1:26:54] is
[1:26:54] wonderful life is
[1:26:57] God in him was life and that was the
[1:27:01] light of men this is a this is what
[1:27:03] created the whole
[1:27:04] Cosmos this is what made a beautiful
[1:27:07] garden
[1:27:10] of not human with limited view but God
[1:27:13] looked on all of his life and said it's
[1:27:16] good no it's actually very good so see
[1:27:20] friends imagine if I took away every
[1:27:23] circumstance that caused you any
[1:27:25] distress then life is a beautiful thing
[1:27:28] God gave us life and we we love life and
[1:27:31] every human wants to live I i' I've seen
[1:27:34] people who are down at death store and
[1:27:36] they wanted to live what is it that
[1:27:39] people it's not always a fear they just
[1:27:41] they don't you know I one of the queens
[1:27:43] of England she said oh if I'd give
[1:27:45] everything for this five more minutes of
[1:27:49] Life see just like I mean that's no
[1:27:54] different than than if the world was
[1:27:58] unpolluted I mean I what we love the
[1:28:02] world what we don't love is the world
[1:28:05] order all right so but we we love the
[1:28:08] world you know it's it's the
[1:28:11] contaminations of the world and the
[1:28:13] contaminations of the earth that burden
[1:28:16] us as brother Brenham said the cosmos
[1:28:18] the world world order that's what we
[1:28:20] wish was different different thank God
[1:28:23] it's going to be but I love the earth I
[1:28:26] love nature we we take hikes in the
[1:28:29] wilderness Trails we you I've done it
[1:28:32] you've done it we've we've summited
[1:28:34] mountain peaks and when you get up there
[1:28:37] and you breathe in all of that fresh air
[1:28:40] oh there's something euphoric about it
[1:28:42] it's invigorating it's renewing how many
[1:28:44] have done that see it it feels like such
[1:28:48] a deep cleansing of the human spirit I
[1:28:50] mean I love nature we watch animals we
[1:28:54] my my son's got me into watching birds
[1:28:56] and everything we were looking sister
[1:28:57] Debbie and I she'll scream in the house
[1:28:59] come quick hurry run I think the world's
[1:29:01] ending and it's a bird on and and I got
[1:29:03] to grab the oh it's beautiful you see
[1:29:05] that green that blue wow what kind is
[1:29:07] that I know call
[1:29:11] Jonathan she scared me to death the
[1:29:13] other day I thought she was being
[1:29:14] murdered and it was just a bird and was
[1:29:18] a beautiful one though I have to admit
[1:29:20] so so you know we we we see these things
[1:29:24] we we see you know you see
[1:29:27] highdefinition video of great Mammoth
[1:29:30] whales hundreds and hundreds of tons
[1:29:33] breaching the surface and soaring and
[1:29:35] crashing down with just a thunderous
[1:29:39] effect oh my it it has it has such an
[1:29:43] effect on us we love the world it's it's
[1:29:46] the world order that brother brandham
[1:29:48] said we're unfitted for catch it he said
[1:29:51] that in the
[1:29:53] 60s he said in the 60s that was
[1:29:56] Kindergarten yeah amen that was nothing
[1:30:00] compared to now and he said in the 60s
[1:30:03] that psychiatrists were having to go see
[1:30:05] psychiatrist and doctors were
[1:30:08] prescribing uh medicine to doctors and
[1:30:10] and he said it's a neurotic world and a
[1:30:13] neurotic age and he said it's an age
[1:30:15] that we seem unfitted
[1:30:19] for oh I can so relate to that I I'm
[1:30:22] unfitted for this world none of us like
[1:30:25] it it's uncomfortable it's full of
[1:30:28] unrelenting pressures of life that you
[1:30:31] know we have to daily walk through and
[1:30:33] the constant stress and the anxiety of
[1:30:35] decisions and actions and and and and
[1:30:39] then I mean that that pales you know our
[1:30:43] stresses and our anxieties we think are
[1:30:45] so bad but that that pales in comparison
[1:30:47] to the horrible sin of war and disase
[1:30:51] disease and suffering and sometimes if
[1:30:56] we'd be honest sometimes suffering can
[1:30:58] snowball and have such an effect that we
[1:31:01] get like Paul when he said to the
[1:31:03] Corinthians I was pressed out of measure
[1:31:06] until I even despaired of
[1:31:08] life that's the Apostle who literally
[1:31:12] despaired of life and he says he says I
[1:31:16] felt as though I had the sentence of
[1:31:18] death within
[1:31:20] myself I want to say to you today
[1:31:23] imagine just for a moment stripping
[1:31:26] everything away that came after the
[1:31:29] fall imagine the life you would have
[1:31:33] right now in Real Time Imagine stripping
[1:31:36] away a removal of everything that got
[1:31:40] added to my life that wasn't supposed to
[1:31:42] be there where only Pure Life
[1:31:47] remains imagine if you could stand in
[1:31:50] this room today and the only thing of
[1:31:53] your whole existence was just pure
[1:31:55] unfettered
[1:31:57] unadulterated
[1:31:59] life all of our stresses all of our
[1:32:03] fears can you imagine it all of our
[1:32:07] anxieties all sickness all injury all
[1:32:12] calamities all
[1:32:15] gone all fleshly
[1:32:18] weakness towards sin and our fa years
[1:32:22] all
[1:32:23] gone imagine that for a moment oh I'll
[1:32:26] be happy friends oh my I'm here to tell
[1:32:29] you I whatever that little wooden room
[1:32:32] is I don't know maybe it's just a
[1:32:34] supernatural decontamination chamber I
[1:32:37] think if I ever needed a decontamination
[1:32:40] chamber someplace I could go in and have
[1:32:43] my mind cleaned and my heart purged and
[1:32:46] it strip away everything except what God
[1:32:50] ordained for me before the foundation of
[1:32:53] the world perfect health think about it
[1:32:55] perfect strength perfect love perfect
[1:32:58] Faith a perfect life mind body and soul
[1:33:05] perfect I don't know what condition I
[1:33:09] don't know
[1:33:11] fully what condition I'll be in or that
[1:33:14] you'll be
[1:33:15] in right at the
[1:33:18] moment of our just before for our
[1:33:23] change but here's what I do know now
[1:33:27] beloved now we are the sons of
[1:33:30] God I do know
[1:33:34] that yeah I got plenty of failures
[1:33:37] plenty of weaknesses plenty of stress
[1:33:39] plenty of anxieties plenty of decisions
[1:33:42] but I know that underneath all of that
[1:33:44] debris there's a life pulse beating and
[1:33:48] I know that someday this robe of Flesh
[1:33:50] will fall I I know that I am a Son of
[1:33:53] God and it does not appear what we shall
[1:33:55] be but we know when he shall appear we
[1:33:59] shall be like him for we shall see him
[1:34:02] as he is I know that much and that helps
[1:34:04] me quite a
[1:34:06] bit I say Lord bring on the little
[1:34:09] room amen is that your
[1:34:13] desire whatever that looks like whatever

[1:34:24] mean you're living in a day with
[1:34:27] unprecedented levels of

[1:34:46] when we need a spoken word of creation

[1:39:39] queen king and the queen so God has
[1:39:44] these these decontamination Chambers all
[1:39:47] over the world and we're finding out
[1:39:50] that it's brought us to a place where
[1:39:53] this can become a reality in our in our
[1:39:56] very lives so so when he says here now
[1:40:00] there here's a scripture where brother
[1:40:02] brandham uh where I actually quoted it
[1:40:04] to you we are you are come to Mount Zion
[1:40:07] under the city of the Living God that's
[1:40:08] Hebrews 12 brother Bram talked about it
[1:40:11] often it goes on to say and to Jesus the
[1:40:14] mediator of the New Covenant to the
[1:40:16] blood of sprinkling that speaketh better
[1:40:18] things than that of Abel so I know the
[1:40:20] re reation of
[1:40:22] Abel that he received was from God you
[1:40:26] agree I know that it met the challenge
[1:40:30] of the hour then all right but that day
[1:40:34] on Calvary gave me a better sacrifice
[1:40:38] than Abel yeah see because I'm going to
[1:40:41] have a greater challenge a better
[1:40:42] sacrifice gave me a better position it's
[1:40:45] a position where where where as as
[1:40:48] sister Deborah put it in their in the
[1:40:50] skit that that it's not just that your
[1:40:52] sins are covered your sins are purged
[1:40:56] they're taken
[1:40:57] away
[1:40:59] hallelujah oh my that's the very thing
[1:41:01] David longed for and strove for amen and
[1:41:04] I I came here this morning for that kind
[1:41:07] of a cleansing friends a power to live a
[1:41:10] higher life and I plan to go higher
[1:41:13] still how about
[1:41:15] you now I and I'm gonna fly over this
[1:41:18] part here because we've already taught
[1:41:19] on it quite a bit
[1:41:22] when when we when we found that we gave
[1:41:26] you the example of
[1:41:28] Isaiah and Isaiah Rema Came Upon Isaiah
[1:41:33] and he said behold a virgin shall
[1:41:35] conceive and then once he wrote it and
[1:41:38] it went it went on parchment then Isaiah
[1:41:41] passed away then it became logos it
[1:41:44] became the established word you remember
[1:41:47] that and then when Gabriel comes to the
[1:41:50] Virgin Mary
[1:41:51] and he goes back and quotes the word the
[1:41:53] logos of Isaiah and when Mary says be it
[1:41:58] unto me according to Thy word then it
[1:42:00] became fresh Rema to her amen and and so
[1:42:04] so so I I said to you last time John saw
[1:42:09] and wrote in a book that as it was in
[1:42:12] the days of the seventh angel when he
[1:42:14] shall begin to sound John was writing
[1:42:16] what he saw and heard and when John left
[1:42:19] and came home from patmas that went into
[1:42:21] the Bible that became logos and it
[1:42:23] waited 2,000 years and a people at the
[1:42:26] end time now it becomes Rema once more
[1:42:29] because we believe it not only do I
[1:42:32] believe it but I am it
[1:42:35] Hallelujah this is this is exactly why
[1:42:38] when when we here we are reading these
[1:42:40] quotes listen friends here we are
[1:42:42] reading these
[1:42:44] quotes when William Brandon was saying
[1:42:46] them they were Rema to him and then they
[1:42:50] went on t AP and then they went in books
[1:42:52] and then he went home and here we are
[1:42:54] today sitting in a church going back
[1:42:57] reading his quotes and you know what's
[1:42:58] happening logos is becoming Rema all
[1:43:01] over again it became the established
[1:43:03] word do you realize that that's why it's
[1:43:05] effectual in your life do you know that
[1:43:07] that's why you're writing a second book
[1:43:09] of Acts because it's not just logos it's
[1:43:13] not just the established word the all
[1:43:15] the denominations have the established
[1:43:17] same Bible I carry but I'm a living
[1:43:20] example of the word do you realize that
[1:43:23] on the day of judgment that that is what
[1:43:26] will allow God to rightly judge the
[1:43:29] world because because of what the bride
[1:43:32] became right because when you leave here
[1:43:36] right now you're you're experiencing
[1:43:38] Rema say how do I know it's Rema because
[1:43:40] it's changing your life every day it's
[1:43:41] drawing you closer and closer is it amen
[1:43:44] then that's Rema but what's what's going
[1:43:47] to happen friends is on the day of
[1:43:49] judgment God is not going to have to go
[1:43:52] back to the first book of Acts to judge
[1:43:54] this last stage he'll go to the second
[1:43:56] book of Acts because of people became
[1:43:59] the word and that becomes the
[1:44:01] established logos at the day of judgment
[1:44:04] and he'll judge that's why Jesus said to
[1:44:07] his listen Jesus said to his
[1:44:10] generation that that the queen of the
[1:44:13] South the men of Nineveh will rise on
[1:44:16] that day and judge this generation the
[1:44:19] queen of the South back there will rise
[1:44:22] on the day of judgment and judge this
[1:44:23] generation speaking about his own
[1:44:25] generation and he said because and it
[1:44:27] listen it had it had very little to do
[1:44:29] with what the queen of the South said it
[1:44:32] had everything to do with what she did
[1:44:35] the Bible records that she said there
[1:44:37] was nothing like it no words to describe
[1:44:39] she gives a a testimony about being with
[1:44:41] Solomon but brother Brandon when he
[1:44:43] comes to the Queen of Sheba he doesn't
[1:44:45] talk about what she said as much as what
[1:44:48] she did she crossed the desert she
[1:44:51] risked her life she went three months
[1:44:54] just to hear a church
[1:44:56] service oh it wasn't what the men of
[1:44:58] Nineveh said it wasn't what Jonah said
[1:45:01] the Bible says it's what Nineveh did
[1:45:04] they repented they covered themselves in
[1:45:07] sackcloth and Ashes they called a fast
[1:45:10] even the king came off his throne and
[1:45:12] sat in ashes even they put sackcloth on
[1:45:15] the
[1:45:16] animals they wouldn't even let the
[1:45:18] animals eat or drink and the whole
[1:45:20] Nation repented before God and Jesus
[1:45:23] said those men will rise and condemn
[1:45:26] this generation not because they had
[1:45:28] more knowledge of the Bible than the
[1:45:30] Jews but because they had obeyed the
[1:45:33] word of
[1:45:34] God your life this second book of Acts
[1:45:38] is what God will be able to justifiably
[1:45:42] judge the world for because no one can
[1:45:45] say it couldn't be done because he'll
[1:45:48] have a queen sitting with him
[1:45:51] on the
[1:45:52] throne that's you and me that's where we
[1:45:55] are right now I'm going to stop today I
