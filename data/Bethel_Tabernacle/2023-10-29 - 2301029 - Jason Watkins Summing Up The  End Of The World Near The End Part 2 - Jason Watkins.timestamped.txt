[36:34] the enemy doesn't mean he doesn't have
[36:36] some power and ability but the power you
[36:40] have is greater than his power because
[36:41] your power is pure uncut power of God
[36:44] his power is God's power
[36:47] perverted see the difference amen praise
[36:51] the Lord Isaiah chapter 55
[36:54] today want to continue by the help of
[36:56] the Lord from Sunday previous to the
[37:00] camp amen I only got a little ways down
[37:03] into that and I have more ground I want
[37:05] to cover today I won't get to it all
[37:08] amen looks like there'll be at least a
[37:10] third part minimally and so uh and so we
[37:14] just want to cover today what the Lord
[37:16] has burdened our heart with and I had to
[37:18] figure out where where that limit is
[37:21] amen but I believe I found it amen I
[37:24] believe I I've got the mind of the Lord
[37:37] I want to hear it again we're going to
[37:39] recap a just a wee bit this morning
[37:41] Isaiah chapter
[37:43] 55 and we're going to read verses 6
[37:46] through n you have it say
[37:48] amen and I don't think I had any other
[37:51] announcements to
[37:52] make Isaiah
[37:55] 556 to
[37:57] N Seek Ye the Lord while he may be
[38:02] found call ye upon him while he is near
[38:07] boy is that good
[38:08] advice all
[38:10] right let the wicked forsake his way and
[38:14] the unrighteous man his
[38:16] thoughts and let him return unto the
[38:20] Lord here's the good news and he will
[38:22] have mercy upon him and to our God for
[38:26] he will abundantly pardon you'd think
[38:30] nobody would turn this
[38:31] down I mean that's amazing that the
[38:36] offended party is willing to be forgiven
[38:40] forgiving and we're not the offended
[38:42] ones he is we're the ones who offended
[38:44] him and yet he's coming forward to say
[38:47] just return to me and it'll all be okay
[38:51] wow um for my watch what he said now we
[38:54] have a hard time understanding that but
[38:56] he's going to help help us here in verse
[38:57] eight for my thoughts are not your
[39:00] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[39:04] sayith the Lord thanks be to God if I
[39:09] was running the kingdom of God we'd be
[39:11] in a mess if you were running the
[39:14] kingdom of God we'd be in a
[39:17] mess hallelujah thank God everybody say
[39:22] thank God Hallelujah he's in control
[39:27] verse nine for as the heavens are higher
[39:31] than the earth so are my ways higher
[39:35] than your ways now there's the heavens
[39:37] are uh unlimited friends we're not just
[39:40] talking about the clouds we're going on
[39:41] out into the Milky Way and on out into
[39:45] Alpha centor and on on on and on and on
[39:47] to No End Amen that's how far his ways
[39:50] are above our
[39:52] ways for as the heavens are higher than
[39:56] the Earth so are my ways higher than
[39:59] your ways and my thoughts than your
[40:04] thoughts let's pray Master we thank you
[40:08] for your word this morning I thank you
[40:10] for the anointing to preach and Lord let
[40:13] it be upon my body Lord so many of us
[40:18] not hitting on all cylinders today
[40:20] myself included but I know the anointing
[40:22] will make up for it so I'm willing to
[40:25] spend and be spent Lord for your kingdom
[40:27] for your people I pray you will help us
[40:30] now be with my voice and my throat and
[40:33] uh give me your mind I pray in Jesus
[40:35] name amen God bless you friends you can
[40:38] be
[40:45] seated amen praise the
[40:55] Lord
[40:59] better this Sunday than a couple weeks
[41:01] ago when I had to call that out so I
[41:04] hope it ain't just because of a thin
[41:05] crowd don't forget don't you know don't
[41:08] be running in and out so much friends
[41:10] you need to be here you need to hear
[41:12] every God there's always Necessities
[41:15] sometimes it has to happen mothers with
[41:17] babies and different things like that
[41:19] and little kids sometimes have
[41:20] emergencies so to adults but uh let's
[41:23] just that you know pleasing to the Lord
[41:27] so last time when we took up this
[41:30] thought summing up the world near the
[41:34] end and that's where we are and so I I
[41:39] we took this uh this this philosophical
[41:44] approach we didn't that wasn't the
[41:45] approach to our sermon we were taking
[41:48] the word udonia from we were contrasting
[41:52] the aristotlean way of contentment
[41:56] fulfillment and joy and happiness and we
[41:58] were contrasting that with the ways of
[42:01] Christ and the word of God and brother
[42:03] brandham did that and we were patterning
[42:06] this sermon is and I've recommended that
[42:08] you go and hear it because this series
[42:11] is patterned off of brother bram's
[42:13] sermon wisdom versus faith and we're not
[42:16] talking about the good kind of wisdom
[42:18] which is God's wisdom that's the only
[42:19] one that's good we're talking about the
[42:21] wisdom of man all right so let's go back
[42:24] and let's revisit that so we can get
[42:26] that fresh in your mind because it's
[42:28] been a couple of weeks I'll take my
[42:29] PowerPoint now brother Caleb and there's
[42:32] only a couple of slides so you can just
[42:34] make the change for me brother Caleb all
[42:36] right let's this is udonia or udonia
[42:39] it's pronounced various ways it means
[42:42] happiness according to the Greeks all
[42:46] right keep that in mind all right next
[42:48] screen um thought we had
[42:51] a backup one
[42:54] Caleb I see so I'm wondering where my
[42:57] text is let me read this for you since I
[42:59] somehow it's not there uh udonia is a
[43:03] term which comes from Aristotle's work
[43:06] called neoman ethics and it means
[43:11] individual well-being and happiness got
[43:15] that individual well-being and happiness
[43:18] and and Aristotle is going to put it
[43:22] forward as a Pursuit not just a that
[43:25] this an important Point not just a
[43:26] temporary feeling but he's saying this
[43:29] is this should be your Pursuit he's
[43:31] trying to teach you his ways to find
[43:34] peace contentment and happiness in your
[43:36] life all right it combines the prefix EU
[43:40] meaning good and Diamond which means
[43:43] spirit in the Greek Socrates also delved
[43:46] into goodness and the virtues of
[43:48] knowledge leading us to achieve the
[43:52] ultimate good now keep it brother bram's
[43:54] sermon in your mind wisdom versus Faith
[43:57] all right now my next screen oh there it
[43:59] is the word udonia is an ancient Greek
[44:03] word that appears in many philosophical
[44:06] texts historically it has been
[44:10] translated as happiness in
[44:13] philosophical uh context though it can
[44:17] mean wealth Prosperity or Good Fortune
[44:20] however most modern historians claim
[44:22] that this is an inaccurate translation
[44:24] udonia is not an emotion it is more a
[44:29] constant state of being all right take
[44:31] that down now we're not trying to as I
[44:34] said to you last time I'm not looking to
[44:37] preach a psych to you today all right
[44:41] but but but don't don't shut me off
[44:44] because I'm coming from the angle that
[44:47] brother brandham took wisdom versus
[44:49] faith and he took it and not only in
[44:51] that sermon but brother Bram talked
[44:53] about the reasoning of God and Eve
[44:55] reasoned the word word and should have
[44:56] stayed with God's word and this is a
[44:59] constant battle and the reason for that
[45:02] and I'm going to say this more than more
[45:04] than one or maybe more than a couple
[45:06] times you're going to have to remember
[45:09] that the that even though you're born
[45:11] again of the spirit of God you're still
[45:13] living in an unconverted
[45:15] body and your flesh which brother Bram
[45:19] divides it up between flesh and spirit
[45:21] that's really those 10 senses that make
[45:24] up the Fallen part of you that soul
[45:26] that's you is the nature of God that
[45:29] that's the real you amen as Paul said at
[45:33] one time we were all um had our
[45:35] conversation in the lust of the flesh
[45:38] the things of the world is that right is
[45:41] that right and and we were the children
[45:44] of Wrath even as
[45:46] others right but God who is rich in
[45:49] Mercy loved us while we were Sinners he
[45:52] loved us already he didn't start loving
[45:54] me when I repented
[45:56] he loved me because I came from him and
[45:59] he knew he always knew I would believe
[46:01] his word and I do because I can't not
[46:06] you say well what about the parts you
[46:07] don't understand friends if your faith
[46:09] doesn't go beyond your understanding
[46:11] you're in a world to
[46:13] hurt my faith always is going to go
[46:15] beyond my understanding because God has
[46:17] already told me his ways are higher than
[46:19] mine and his thoughts aren't like mine
[46:21] and if I try to figure him out with my
[46:23] own thinking I'm going to be in a log
[46:25] Jam things aren't going to seem right
[46:27] they're not going to seem fair they're
[46:28] going to you know we've got to realize
[46:32] that this
[46:37] Fallen let the mind which was in Christ
[46:41] be in you see let that one operate let
[46:46] that one inform your thinking let that
[46:49] mind guide your footsteps is that
[46:52] fair if you don't then then you'll
[46:55] you'll find find yourself you in in a in
[46:57] a ditch sure sure
[47:00] enough want to be in a
[47:02] ditch amen praise the Lord I want to I
[47:05] want to be amen balanced in the word of
[47:08] God I my goodness I I heard a great man
[47:11] make a great statement he said you know
[47:14] and to this effect that if you're going
[47:16] to walk and follow Christ you're always
[47:18] going to have people you know who who
[47:21] get offended when you're not in their
[47:24] ditch I don't want to be in nobody's
[47:26] ditch I want to be in the middle of the
[47:28] road
[47:29] amen so we found out then that that that
[47:34] part of you that that memory and reason
[47:38] and affection conscious and
[47:42] imaginations say well I thought it was
[47:45] you know my taste my touch my SM those
[47:47] are just inlets that's how you contact
[47:50] the world through your touch through
[47:52] your sight through your hearing through
[47:53] your smell through your taste but that
[47:56] that that part of you that makes
[47:59] decisions is in your mind where the
[48:02] memories are and Satan can anoint those
[48:05] and then he can he can light up your
[48:07] imagination and tie it to a memory and
[48:09] then pour in some reasoning and get you
[48:11] thinking there and if you're not careful
[48:14] then that thought which it could be
[48:16] contrary to the word of God will cause
[48:18] your flesh body to act out in ways that
[48:21] aren't according to this amen see and
[48:23] that's why my dad always told me he
[48:25] reminded me of the scripture bring every
[48:27] thought subject every thought can we
[48:29] agree with that today bring because I
[48:32] should because I have to know you know a
[48:35] man's got to know his own
[48:38] limitations amen man's got to know his
[48:41] own limitations a man's got to realize
[48:44] that that that that that his heart is is
[48:48] is exceptionally Wicked and
[48:50] deceitful see that human that Fallen
[48:54] part of you and it will misguide you and
[48:57] mislead you and and disappoint you and
[49:00] you'll be disappointed in yourself
[49:02] you'll say how did I do that how did I
[49:04] let this happen because you didn't bring
[49:07] every thought subject and my dad said if
[49:10] you'll just do that it'll never get to
[49:12] the flesh because if you'll take that
[49:14] thought contrary to the word and bring
[49:15] it to to the Holy Ghost he'll kill
[49:18] it we remember all remember brother
[49:21] brother Joe how Shell's you know what
[49:23] was it the hobo or the bum that he threw
[49:25] throw it in jail and and and he you know
[49:28] he said he thought of it that way you
[49:29] know put him in prison oh my it was so
[49:32] funny but it was so
[49:34] good so so we find that this is this is
[49:39] so necessary my there's so much I want
[49:41] to say today but I'm going to have to be
[49:42] real studious and stick to my notes or I
[49:45] won't get uh what What the Lord Has for
[49:47] us today I feel myself wanting to run
[49:50] ahead so so just as a refresher so make
[49:55] make sure sure we're clear in wisdom
[49:56] versus Faith so this term this Greek
[49:59] term yudia is a concept of ancient Greek
[50:03] philosophy and it refers to a state of
[50:06] flourishing well-being or happiness that
[50:11] in Aristotle's
[50:24] View
[51:42] the higher value in the approach of
[51:46] Christ see toward uh udonia or toward
[51:51] what is real lasting happiness and
[51:53] fulfillment in part one we exposed the
[51:57] flaws and the
[51:59] inferiority of man-made wisdom amen
[52:03] since since since I since Aristotle's
[52:06] view his approach relies on and here's
[52:10] the Fatal flaw it relies on the goodness
[52:13] of
[52:14] humanity which God had already said that
[52:18] there's none good not one see and you
[52:23] know just like I I said here it's not in
[52:26] my notes but the Holy Spirit brings it
[52:27] back to my memory you know we just came
[52:30] from our youth camp and we believe that
[52:32] young men and young women should should
[52:35] seek the will of God within the family
[52:38] of God should seek God to bring their
[52:41] predestinated mate and their focus
[52:43] should only be and they should never
[52:45] look outside the family of God and and
[52:49] and and and if you find yourself uh with
[52:52] a a fancy for someone outside the word
[52:55] of God stay out of the way and let God
[52:58] bring them in cuz all you'll do is
[53:00] hinder God and you'll hinder that person
[53:03] see and so you say well oh he's a good
[53:06] boy I've heard that so many times girls
[53:08] who uh go outside the the safety of
[53:11] God's word oh he's a good man no he's
[53:14] not there's none good boys say oh she's
[53:18] a good girl no she's not there's none
[53:21] good until you're born again of the Holy
[53:23] Spirit and even then you're still got a
[53:25] fallen nature in your
[53:29] flesh see so this was this was the
[53:33] aristotlean flaw because it relied on
[53:35] the goodness of humanity which is never
[53:37] guaranteed whereas in contrast God's
[53:41] word and God's ways are
[53:45] always good and they're always correct
[53:49] so Aristotle's approach while sounding
[53:53] admirable it has its limit limitations
[53:56] precisely because that it it relies on
[54:00] human willpower and effort to achieve a
[54:03] sense of of real uh joy and happiness in
[54:07] other words it puts the burden of
[54:11] something I it it puts the burden of the
[54:14] individual to be good and virtuous the
[54:18] way of Christ on the other hand as we
[54:21] said last time offers something much
[54:23] more it offers a spiritual
[54:27] transformation that comes not of our own
[54:29] efforts but clearly from the grace of
[54:32] God this is why denominationalism is no
[54:36] good it all it is is denominationalism
[54:39] is only just more of aristotlean theory
[54:43] what it's based on see it's based on as
[54:46] brother brandham said it's man's Wisdom
[54:48] it's reasoning of man that's the beauty
[54:50] of the Christian message that God loves
[54:53] us unconditionally and made a way for us
[54:56] to be reconciled to him through Christ
[55:00] regardless of our failures regardless of
[55:02] our shortcoming this is why brother
[55:03] Brandon would say that that that God
[55:06] will never condemn a man for being a
[55:09] sinner said because he was born a sinner
[55:12] see God knows that God's a just God
[55:15] you're not going to impune him with
[55:16] Injustice every he he said he knows that
[55:19] man was born a sinner brother am said
[55:21] that's not what'll condemn him what'll
[55:22] condemn him in the end is that he
[55:24] remained a sinner
[55:25] when he didn't have to that the blood of
[55:28] the Lamb provided a way out see and so
[55:32] in part one we found that the human that
[55:35] human happiness and this was a big
[55:39] point that human happiness and I and I
[55:42] didn't make this I didn't really cabbage
[55:44] down hard on it on part one so I really
[55:46] want to nail it down
[55:48] today that human
[55:52] happiness and human Joy
[55:56] are different from the joy of the Lord
[55:59] which is our
[56:03] strength because the
[56:05] joy of the Lord that is our strength
[56:09] doesn't require
[56:11] happiness or fortunate circumstances or
[56:15] blessing in the rain you still have it
[56:18] in the Cloudy you still have it in the
[56:19] trial you still have it the joy of the
[56:22] Lord supersedes all condition that we
[56:25] might
[56:26] face that's what's that's why it's
[56:29] supernatural it's not natural It's
[56:35] Supernatural so it's only achieved
[56:38] through the indwelling spirit of Christ
[56:40] Jesus ha having him living in you Jesus
[56:47] brings it down to as they say you know
[56:51] we have these these sayings Jesus brings
[56:53] it down to the brast tax in in St John
[56:56] chapter 3 Jesus as we would say puts it
[57:00] on the money Jesus as we would say he
[57:03] hits the nail on the head here you ready
[57:06] for this you ready to hit the nail on
[57:09] the head you ready to bring it down to
[57:11] Brass tax are you ready to put it on the
[57:15] money John 3 uh Caleb let's go with John
[57:19] 3 verses 1
[57:22] to3 there was a man of the Pharisees
[57:26] named nicodem Nicodemus all right now I
[57:30] want you to pay real close attention uh
[57:33] to to this verse and look at the
[57:35] language it's actually saying there was
[57:36] a man of the Pharisees named at
[57:39] Nicodemus a ruler of the
[57:42] Jews the same came to Jesus by night and
[57:46] said unto him Rabbi we know that thou
[57:48] art a teacher come from God for no man
[57:53] can do these men do do these Miracles
[57:56] that thou doest except God be with him
[57:59] because they're seeing the sign of the
[58:00] son of man they hadn't seen that at that
[58:03] level since the man that came to Abraham
[58:07] in the tent in the cool of the
[58:08] day that to see it they' seen it through
[58:11] the prophets in a degree but to see it
[58:14] like that they're saying wow we haven't
[58:16] seen that since the days of Abraham so
[58:19] we know that you are a man come from God
[58:23] all right now catch it for for for we
[58:26] know that thou art a teacher come from
[58:29] God for no man now catch it look at the
[58:34] Gap in his
[58:35] Revelation Jesus to him is just a
[58:38] teacher he's just a man and that's the
[58:42] problem see for no man can do these
[58:46] Miracles that thou doest except God be
[58:49] with him that is so short of the truth
[58:52] God wasn't just with him God was in him
[58:56] God was
[58:59] him Jesus answered and said unto him
[59:02] here he is going to put it on the brass
[59:04] tax truly truly or verily verily I say
[59:07] unto thee except a
[59:10] man be born again he cannot see the
[59:16] kingdom of
[59:18] God that's the that's hitting the nail
[59:20] on the head that just bypasses
[59:23] everything Aristotle ever would think
[59:25] that bypasses man's Wisdom you've got to
[59:28] come wisdom man's Wisdom is no good it's
[59:31] wisdom versus the faith of the Son of
[59:34] God I already know what I want
[59:37] today but you no way to get it until you
[59:40] willing to surrender you stop being
[59:44] you now since we're talking about man
[59:48] thank you brother Caleb since we're
[59:50] talking about man but be ready I got
[59:52] some more we're going to be in the book
[59:54] of mat Matthew quite a
[59:55] bit so since we're talking about man all
[1:00:00] right uh let's go to the owner's manual
[1:00:03] all right we need to thoroughly
[1:00:06] understand our subject so let's go to
[1:00:08] Matthew 4 and we'll catch 18 to 19 this
[1:00:12] is the plan of God for us all you ready
[1:00:16] how many want to know God's
[1:00:19] plan and Jesus Matthew
[1:00:23] 4:18 and Jesus Walking By the Sea of
[1:00:26] Galilee saw two Brethren Simon called
[1:00:28] Peter and Andrew his brother casting a
[1:00:31] net into the sea for they were Fishers
[1:00:33] nothing wrong with that they had a good
[1:00:35] career they were dutifully support
[1:00:37] supplying the need of their family and
[1:00:39] he saith unto them follow me and I will
[1:00:44] make you Fishers of
[1:00:46] Men it didn't change their human
[1:00:49] occupation to do this in other words
[1:00:52] he's tying it together that yeah you're
[1:00:55] going to have jobs and families you're
[1:00:58] going to pay bills and take vacations
[1:01:01] you're going to have times of church and
[1:01:02] Recreation and prayer you're going to
[1:01:04] have what we call the functions of
[1:01:06] living but just remember I'm calling you
[1:01:09] to be more than
[1:01:12] that I'm actually calling you that in
[1:01:15] your life I need you to not just be
[1:01:17] Fishers of fish but Fishers of
[1:01:22] Men see all right Matthew let's go on to
[1:01:26] Matthew chapter 6 watch the warning of
[1:01:30] the Lord Jesus
[1:01:38] here one second make
[1:01:42] sure yeah
[1:01:47] okay so so we're we're we're coming down
[1:01:50] and we're talking about the the the
[1:01:53] difference between human it and God and
[1:01:55] what it really takes to have a fulfilled
[1:01:57] life so Jesus here is going to caution
[1:02:01] us and Matthew
[1:02:03] 62 and he says therefore when thou doest
[1:02:08] thine arms do not sound a trumpet before
[1:02:12] thee as the Hypocrites do in the
[1:02:15] synagogues and in the streets that they
[1:02:19] may have Glory of
[1:02:23] men
[1:02:24] today I thought to myself I'm going to
[1:02:27] announce that I'm I I almost subtitled
[1:02:30] my sermon the problem with
[1:02:34] men now calm down sisters I don't mean
[1:02:37] it like that calm down we're talking
[1:02:40] about Mankind we're talking about
[1:02:43] Humanity all right man ever sister in
[1:02:45] here set up straight when I said that
[1:02:48] tell it brother
[1:02:52] Jason therefore when thou doest thine
[1:02:55] arms do not sound a trumpet before thee
[1:02:57] as the Hypocrites do in the synagogues
[1:02:59] and in the streets that they may have
[1:03:01] Glory of men verily I say unto you they
[1:03:04] have their reward it's an interesting
[1:03:07] thing that that Jesus actually never
[1:03:10] accepted the praise or the testimony of
[1:03:13] men they come to him in John said who
[1:03:16] you know who give us your credentials
[1:03:19] you know you're you're you've got one
[1:03:21] witness who's your other Witnesses and
[1:03:22] Jesus just told him look them right the
[1:03:24] ey he said I don't first of all I don't
[1:03:26] receive the witness of men but you know
[1:03:29] if you if you have to know what about
[1:03:31] John what did John say I was if you
[1:03:34] believe John then you'll receive me if
[1:03:36] you don't receive me then you wouldn't
[1:03:37] believe him see because my Prophet came
[1:03:40] to declare me but but just so you
[1:03:43] know I don't I'm the head of a I'm the
[1:03:46] head of a kingdom that's going to be
[1:03:48] filled with people who don't regard the
[1:03:51] testimony of
[1:03:53] menen we don't we're not interested well
[1:03:56] I don't need men to to uh vote and agree
[1:03:58] with me I need God to vindicate my
[1:04:03] Ministry see and so actually Paul
[1:04:07] amplifies it in his letters in his
[1:04:09] letter to the Romans we're not going to
[1:04:10] go there today but Paul takes it
[1:04:12] teaching that not only not only do real
[1:04:16] Believers not depend on it that actually
[1:04:20] real Believers don't pursue
[1:04:23] it they don't chase it they don't care
[1:04:27] about fortune and Glory popularity
[1:04:29] clicks or
[1:04:31] likes they they don't they don't accept
[1:04:33] it and they don't chase it
[1:04:37] Hallelujah my men mankind is just messed
[1:04:42] up I hope I can get you to see that
[1:04:45] today I hope I can get you to see that
[1:04:48] they say well man you're going to hurt
[1:04:49] my feelings well I'm hurting mine
[1:04:51] too
[1:04:53] see we're we're messed up people and
[1:04:56] there is no chance for us except God
[1:04:59] come down in his mercy and give us his
[1:05:01] mind today how many want his mind
[1:05:04] today here's another problem on into
[1:05:07] Matthew Matthew
[1:05:09] 19 see so as we come to Matthew
[1:05:13] 19 so so I I want to I just want to make
[1:05:17] this I'll give you the verse in a second
[1:05:18] brother Caleb I want to make this final
[1:05:20] Point here at Matthew
[1:05:22] 6 is that
[1:05:24] acceptance by the world or agreement
[1:05:28] from the world order is not
[1:05:33] required for me to have perfect
[1:05:37] faith in what I'm
[1:05:39] doing in fact
[1:05:43] really in and probably in perfect
[1:05:46] contradistinction if I'm if I'm getting
[1:05:49] the Applause of the world I probably
[1:05:50] have a
[1:05:52] problem amen I mean you know it should
[1:05:55] be a red flag if we find that our
[1:05:58] beliefs and our ways are comparable with
[1:06:02] the world order or the world view I
[1:06:06] don't have nor want a world view not the
[1:06:09] world order I don't mind being here in
[1:06:12] the world it's God created it's my world
[1:06:14] I own it it's part it's for my f for his
[1:06:17] family and but I don't want the the
[1:06:19] world order in its Fallen condition and
[1:06:22] I don't I don't want the applaud it of
[1:06:24] the world cuz then I would be nervous
[1:06:27] how is it that the world is accepting me
[1:06:29] so
[1:06:31] easily They didn't accept Jesus They
[1:06:35] didn't accept the prophets Jesus said
[1:06:37] that to them which of the prophets did
[1:06:40] your fathers not
[1:06:43] kill tell me which disciple which
[1:06:45] apostle was
[1:06:47] popular that they didn't
[1:06:50] murder
[1:06:51] see so it's not that the Lord is saying
[1:06:56] to us go out and be an oddball brother
[1:06:59] Brandon was against you doing that he
[1:07:02] said now he's not against you being an
[1:07:04] oddball but he was against you making
[1:07:06] yourself
[1:07:08] odd because that's just another form of
[1:07:11] of of wisdom of man's Wisdom don't make
[1:07:14] yourself odd just be a Christian you'll
[1:07:17] be odd enough just doing that
[1:07:21] see all right now Caleb we'll to Matthew
[1:07:25] 19:12 here's men promoting and
[1:07:28] positioning other men for there are some
[1:07:30] Unix which were so born from their
[1:07:33] mother's womb God made them that see and
[1:07:36] there are some Unix which were made Unix
[1:07:38] of
[1:07:39] men Welly the last thing I would I would
[1:07:42] want to think that when I when I go home
[1:07:46] on Sunday afternoons I always find
[1:07:49] myself grateful that I can look back and
[1:07:51] see how God moved in his word and I
[1:07:53] already know it's beyond me and I'm so
[1:07:56] glad to know that when problems come and
[1:07:59] trials and tribulations and things and
[1:08:01] you have problems or I have problems I'm
[1:08:03] so glad to know that I've not been
[1:08:05] called of men and I've not been hatched
[1:08:07] out of an incubation chamber we we are
[1:08:09] the true living Saints of the Lord God
[1:08:12] he's obligated to us to keep us to
[1:08:15] protect us to help us to instruct
[1:08:19] us I I I think that every time I come
[1:08:21] out that door Lord I'm about to bring
[1:08:23] the word I can't do anything for these
[1:08:25] people but I know the word is
[1:08:27] Supernatural and it'll go out and
[1:08:29] wherever believing Hearts receive it
[1:08:32] it'll fix them it'll fix me it'll fix
[1:08:36] us
[1:08:38] hallelujah see so some are made Unix of
[1:08:41] men why is that a bad thing why is it a
[1:08:44] bad thing to have men and these programs
[1:08:48] of men glad you asked that's a good
[1:08:50] question mark chapter
[1:08:52] 7
[1:08:55] Mark chapter 7:21 here's why that's a
[1:08:57] bad thing for from within out of the
[1:09:02] heart of who
[1:09:04] men out of the heart of men proceed evil
[1:09:09] thoughts adulteries
[1:09:12] fornications
[1:09:14] murders
[1:09:16] so I if we are if I'm a man and I am
[1:09:21] then I and I don't have adulteries and
[1:09:24] fornications in my mind and I don't have
[1:09:27] murders in my mind I I I think about the
[1:09:30] love of God and about purity and about
[1:09:32] Holiness so I have to conclude that I'm
[1:09:35] a different kind of man than what he's
[1:09:37] talking about thank God I'm not that
[1:09:40] kind of a man
[1:09:43] see let's go back to Matthew chapter 15
[1:09:46] sorry to jump you around today brother
[1:09:48] Caleb getting a good
[1:09:52] workout so here here you're going to
[1:09:55] find in Matthew
[1:09:57] 15 and we're going to go 6 to9 you're
[1:10:00] going to find out that the worship of
[1:10:02] men is rejected by
[1:10:05] God thus have you made the Commandment
[1:10:08] of God of none effect by your
[1:10:13] tradition ye
[1:10:15] Hypocrites well did Isaiah prophesy of
[1:10:18] you saying this people draweth nigh unto
[1:10:23] me with their mouth and honth me with
[1:10:27] their lips but their heart is far from
[1:10:32] me but in vain do they worship me
[1:10:36] brother Bram would take this so many
[1:10:39] times and say look they actually
[1:10:42] worshiped Cain worshiped they all they
[1:10:46] all triy to come and worship Judas tried
[1:10:50] to worship caiaphus made a living
[1:10:52] worshiping Caiaphas see and so but Jesus
[1:10:56] doesn't deny their efforts to worship
[1:10:59] but in vain do they worship me here's
[1:11:02] why teaching for Doctrine the
[1:11:05] Commandments
[1:11:08] of
[1:11:10] men there's no value in
[1:11:13] it if your
[1:11:16] experience in the word of God is just
[1:11:20] human wisdom and human Ascent to
[1:11:24] teaching if you can logically if if this
[1:11:27] is the limit I logically can see this
[1:11:30] teaching of God's prophet in the Bible
[1:11:33] so I agree with it I believe it I I
[1:11:36] that's the way I should do that's the
[1:11:37] way I should go that's the way I should
[1:11:39] live i g tell you something friends
[1:11:40] that's a good thing and I got because
[1:11:43] the brother Ram said it has to start
[1:11:44] there you have to agree with the word
[1:11:46] said if he can ever get that inner man
[1:11:47] to agree with the word then that nature
[1:11:50] dies and a seed Gene comes to life
[1:11:51] that's the new birth but it's got to go
[1:11:54] from here to here it's got to because
[1:11:57] this will this I promise you this will
[1:12:00] desert you in times of
[1:12:02] trouble if the you say well i' I've had
[1:12:05] trouble but if the temperature gets hot
[1:12:07] enough this will desert you this will
[1:12:09] have all kinds of things this will K do
[1:12:11] you like that right there you won't know
[1:12:13] whether to go you whether to come here
[1:12:14] or sick them you won't can't go forward
[1:12:16] you can't back up you're just going in a
[1:12:18] circle you're just in chaos come back
[1:12:21] and let the mind of Christ be in
[1:12:27] you I mean I want you to think about how
[1:12:30] Politically
[1:12:32] Incorrect you know in a large part of
[1:12:34] America if Jesus showed up in Washington
[1:12:37] DC and said this about the
[1:12:42] Jews with the climate right now with a
[1:12:45] political climate right now if Jesus
[1:12:48] Christ showed up at the Capitol rotunda
[1:12:51] and stepped out on the steps of the
[1:12:53] capital building and said you Jews
[1:12:56] you're Hypocrites well did Isaiah
[1:12:59] prophesy of you saying you draw nigh to
[1:13:01] me with your mouth and honor me with
[1:13:03] your lips but your heart is far from
[1:13:06] me my the conservative right would want
[1:13:09] to shut him
[1:13:11] down
[1:13:12] see but Jesus is not speaking just
[1:13:16] narrowly to Jews who who were unfaithful
[1:13:21] to Jehovah you know that it it's broader
[1:13:24] than that it's Jesus is speaking
[1:13:27] universally to anybody to to anybody
[1:13:31] that takes the traditions of men over
[1:13:35] the word of God am it doesn't matter
[1:13:38] what your lineage Heritage or
[1:13:40] nationality is he's speaking to the
[1:13:43] whole
[1:13:45] world
[1:13:47] see so the traditions of men can't be
[1:13:51] relied on history shows that history
[1:13:56] shows
[1:13:58] implicitly
[1:14:00] incontrovertibly that that mankind is
[1:14:02] forever straying away from the word of
[1:14:05] God you know the original word of God
[1:14:08] and and it and even you know I would say
[1:14:11] that one of the most reliable things
[1:14:13] about Fallen humanity is he's
[1:14:18] unreliable to stay true to the word of
[1:14:20] God that's his most reliable characteris
[1:14:23] ISC is that he's unreliable to stay true
[1:14:25] to the word of God and it doesn't matter
[1:14:28] if he starts in a perfect environment
[1:14:30] like Eden or if he starts in a perfect
[1:14:33] Recycling and a perfectly cleaned off
[1:14:36] world like Noah from there man will
[1:14:39] still go off the path and it didn't even
[1:14:42] take
[1:14:45] long I I I want to explore that further
[1:14:48] in part three but I I want to move
[1:14:51] on so he always
[1:14:54] starts you know doesn't matter what the
[1:14:56] condition of the Lord is Humanity has
[1:14:58] never not done that over
[1:15:02] time here is
[1:15:04] a a look at the history of mankind I'll
[1:15:07] give you this much of
[1:15:09] it here's a here's a a sneak peek a
[1:15:12] quick peek of the history of mankind
[1:15:16] towards the word Jesus is going to give
[1:15:18] us this in the middle actually a little
[1:15:20] further than the middle cuz he's he's at
[1:15:23] he's at roughly you know the 4,000 year
[1:15:25] mark since Eden roughly and there's only
[1:15:28] about roughly a couple thousand more
[1:15:30] years until the whole Plan of Redemption
[1:15:32] is wound up so he's he's a good
[1:15:35] two-thirds of the way when he says in
[1:15:38] Matthew
[1:15:39] 17 and we're going to catch verses 22 to
[1:15:47] 23 and while they Abode in
[1:15:51] Galilee Jesus said unto
[1:15:54] them the son of man shall be
[1:15:57] betrayed into the hands of
[1:16:00] men and they shall kill
[1:16:05] him so the appetite for fallen
[1:16:10] Humanity has proven over 4,000 years at
[1:16:13] this point over 4,000 years Jesus is
[1:16:17] speaking
[1:16:19] authoritatively that the appetite of
[1:16:21] Fallen humanity is not toward God's
[1:16:27] word Matthew
[1:16:30] 16:23 but he turned and said unto
[1:16:35] Peter get thee behind me Satan Thou Art
[1:16:39] an offense to me for thou savest not the
[1:16:43] things that be of God but those that be
[1:16:48] of
[1:16:51] men friends I I I've had weeks to think
[1:16:55] about
[1:16:56] this I I I preached part one two weeks
[1:16:59] ago
[1:17:01] and all of the concepts that I'm
[1:17:03] bringing you today were in my mind when
[1:17:06] the Lord began to lay this burden on on
[1:17:08] my
[1:17:09] heart read it again but he turned and
[1:17:12] said unto Peter get thee behind
[1:17:16] me get thee behind me Satan he's not
[1:17:19] talking to Peter he's talking about the
[1:17:20] spirit that's anointing him Peter's not
[1:17:23] Satan you you're if you're a child of
[1:17:26] God you're not the devil and you never
[1:17:28] can be if you're predestinated to be a
[1:17:31] wheat you'll always be that amen see and
[1:17:35] so he turned to Peter get thee behind me
[1:17:37] Satan Thou Art an offense unto me for
[1:17:39] thou savest not the things that be of
[1:17:42] God but those that be of men so so I
[1:17:46] have to conclude that even sons of
[1:17:49] God you know um even even sons of God
[1:17:54] who make it a practice of being led by
[1:17:57] the spirit of God can actually find
[1:18:00] themselves thinking 180 degrees opposite
[1:18:02] of the will of
[1:18:04] God now it's a fair argument if you say
[1:18:07] that Peter didn't have the new birth yet
[1:18:08] that's true but the new birth didn't
[1:18:11] take away the Fallen nature out of his
[1:18:13] Fallen
[1:18:14] flesh Paul picks that up when I would do
[1:18:17] good evil is still present I want to do
[1:18:20] the things of God but I and the but I
[1:18:22] don't the things I don't want to do I
[1:18:24] find myself doing I'm a Wretched Man
[1:18:26] this Paul's speaking of his Born Again
[1:18:28] self I'm still a Wretched Man who shall
[1:18:30] deliver me there's only one I can't
[1:18:32] deliver myself it's Jesus
[1:18:36] Christ so so it is true that Peter
[1:18:40] wasn't Yet full of the Holy Spirit but
[1:18:43] even after he received the new birth he
[1:18:45] still had his Fallen T senses you know
[1:18:48] so I mean you you could say today
[1:18:51] preacher wow you're starting to really
[1:18:52] step on our toes who who who who you
[1:18:55] talking about preacher you know you
[1:18:57] remember my story about being stopped
[1:19:00] out in this parking lot many years ago
[1:19:03] were you preaching on
[1:19:07] me yeah I was I was preaching to
[1:19:11] everybody if the shoe fits wear it y'all
[1:19:14] know the other half if you don't like
[1:19:16] the shoe grow and it won't fit no
[1:19:19] more see here's a better question here's
[1:19:23] a better question and and and not to ask
[1:19:25] the preacher but ask yourself from
[1:19:29] because remember from the owner's manual
[1:19:31] y'all remember in the owner's manual
[1:19:33] when David said I thought on my ways
[1:19:37] Hallelujah so here's the question we
[1:19:39] should be asking it's the question I
[1:19:42] must ask me I'm going to ask three
[1:19:45] people me myself and
[1:19:47] I and the question is do I do I want to
[1:19:52] do
[1:19:53] something or anything without the
[1:19:56] leadership of the Holy
[1:19:59] Ghost and the answer is
[1:20:02] no no I don't not ever not today not
[1:20:07] tomorrow I can't trust me but I do trust
[1:20:11] him do I want to lead myself no I don't
[1:20:14] not today not ever
[1:20:18] see if
[1:20:20] Mankind in his Fallen
[1:20:24] condition could accomplish
[1:20:27] this without the help of the lord we
[1:20:30] wouldn't need a
[1:20:33] millennium if in his Fallen condition he
[1:20:35] could accomplish this there would be no
[1:20:37] more Prejudice or bias or Injustice
[1:20:40] there would be no lust to conquer or
[1:20:43] dominate it would truly be one for all
[1:20:48] and all for one and I'm here to tell you
[1:20:50] thanks be to God that'll never be more
[1:20:52] more true than in a millennial
[1:20:54] world oh I'm looking forward to that day
[1:20:58] friends with all my
[1:21:01] heart where G where the Bible God told
[1:21:03] through Isaiah I make a new Heaven and a
[1:21:05] new Earth Peter picked that up he said I
[1:21:08] make all things new give me Isaiah 65
[1:21:10] Caleb let's read it before we go
[1:21:14] home oh yeah I'm doing good just pray
[1:21:17] for my
[1:21:21] strength here's a beautiful beautiful
[1:21:23] scripture Peter this is this is the
[1:21:26] verse he was talking about he said so
[1:21:28] for it's
[1:21:29] written and verse Isaiah 66 verse 22
[1:21:34] through 24 for as the new heavens and
[1:21:38] the new Earth which I will make shall
[1:21:42] remain before me saith the Lord so shall
[1:21:45] your seed and your name remain isn't
[1:21:48] that
[1:21:49] beautiful and it shall come to pass that
[1:21:52] that from one new moon to another and
[1:21:55] from one Sabbath to another shall All
[1:21:58] Flesh come to worship before me saith
[1:22:01] the Lord I know the world is in turmoil
[1:22:04] I know it's falling apart but it shall
[1:22:06] come to pass I know there's trouble and
[1:22:09] killing and violence but it shall come
[1:22:12] to pass I know we have ups and downs and
[1:22:14] trials and tribulations but it shall
[1:22:17] come to
[1:22:18] pass
[1:22:20] Hallelujah and they shall go forth and
[1:22:23] look upon the carcasses of men that have
[1:22:25] transgressed against me for their worms
[1:22:28] shall not die neither shall their fire
[1:22:30] be quenched and they shall be an aboring
[1:22:32] unto all
[1:22:35] flesh you
[1:22:38] see I I if if you if you if you look at
[1:22:42] it from a human perspective you you'll
[1:22:45] always be out of
[1:22:47] balance because we find that if if I
[1:22:51] just said to you today let let me just
[1:22:53] give you a quick breakdown and this is a
[1:22:55] simplified version okay it's far more
[1:22:57] intricate than I have time to cover
[1:22:59] today but God working among men
[1:23:02] simplified you ready so
[1:23:06] God has only ever directly and
[1:23:09] underscore that word because God has
[1:23:11] dealt with he God the sun comes up every
[1:23:15] day and declares the glory of the
[1:23:17] Lord Paul said the ancient people saw
[1:23:20] God in nature doesn't mean he was
[1:23:22] directly talking them like he did Abel
[1:23:25] or like he did Noah or like he did Enoch
[1:23:28] or like he did Moses you understand you
[1:23:30] understand but go but God fills all time
[1:23:33] space and
[1:23:35] Eternity but but but God has only ever
[1:23:39] directly worked through his seed line
[1:23:41] and that
[1:23:42] alone directly see that that you see
[1:23:47] that manifested from Seth to Noah Before
[1:23:49] the
[1:23:50] Flood and that's of course before
[1:23:53] Abraham and his blood descendants before
[1:23:55] the Jews ever even came on the earth
[1:23:58] amen couple thousand years before the
[1:24:02] the Jewish Nation ever came on the earth
[1:24:05] God was working with his seedline and
[1:24:08] and and um Dr scoffield picks that up
[1:24:12] and brother brandham endorses that where
[1:24:14] scoffield named those five you know you
[1:24:17] start out with innocence the Age of
[1:24:19] Innocence Adam and Eve in a Garden of
[1:24:21] Eden remember that they were innocent
[1:24:23] there was a veil they didn't know they
[1:24:24] were naked they there was no such thing
[1:24:26] as Sin see and then and then you come
[1:24:29] out and then you're going to pick up uh
[1:24:31] after the fall then the Bible refers to
[1:24:33] every man did what was right in in his
[1:24:35] own sight remember that then number
[1:24:37] three I think was human government this
[1:24:39] is from memory and uh and then and then
[1:24:42] number four was because human government
[1:24:45] under remember Nimrod and they come out
[1:24:47] of the Ark and then they started
[1:24:48] populating the Earth and I'm going to go
[1:24:50] into that more heavily in in part three
[1:24:53] but then they came but then come the age
[1:24:55] of Promise under
[1:24:57] Abraham remember that and then and then
[1:25:00] number five was the law under
[1:25:03] Moses then the then the then Grace under
[1:25:07] Christ amen then then the kingdom the
[1:25:11] seventh the kingdom and that's why
[1:25:13] brother brandham said these seals when
[1:25:15] he was preaching the seals and he comes
[1:25:16] to the seven seal he said I guess you
[1:25:18] noticed the little Collins boy the case
[1:25:21] in that leukemia girl and those were
[1:25:23] great Miracles brother brandham said
[1:25:25] what is it it's the kingdom coming as it
[1:25:29] has been because it had been coming once
[1:25:31] those seals were open that's the
[1:25:33] beginning of the Lion of the tribe of
[1:25:35] Judah bringing the kingdom hallelujah oh
[1:25:38] what are you a part of today friends you
[1:25:41] don't have to go by your own wits you
[1:25:43] don't have to worry about your own sick
[1:25:44] mind you can you can say I want the mind
[1:25:47] of
[1:25:48] Christ and you have access to it
[1:25:51] Hallelujah thank you see so so he
[1:25:56] manifested from Seth to Noah from from
[1:25:59] Noah to Abraham you know and then from
[1:26:03] Abraham came Israel and then through
[1:26:05] Moses and then David and then all the
[1:26:07] way out to John the Baptist and now God
[1:26:09] once again from the time of Moses he's
[1:26:13] dealing only directly with his seed line
[1:26:17] in the earth and that's
[1:26:19] Israel and then we find that Jesus the
[1:26:22] Christ comes who's the Keystone between
[1:26:25] the Old and New Testament and after
[1:26:26] Israel's rejection of Messiah as a
[1:26:29] nation and for the last 2,000 years he
[1:26:32] has only dealt directly with Christian
[1:26:36] Gentiles
[1:26:39] only see so they're they're s because
[1:26:42] there's salvation in no other name is
[1:26:45] that the Bible is that what the owners's
[1:26:47] Manuel says there's no salvation in any
[1:26:50] other name except the name of Jesus see
[1:26:53] so and then after his this is this is
[1:26:55] simplified and then after his Gentile
[1:26:57] bride is taken to the wedding supper he
[1:27:00] will again return uh under Moses and
[1:27:03] Elijah to claim true Israel totaling
[1:27:06] 144,000 remember that's 12,000 out of
[1:27:09] each tribe 12 tribes and uh and and from
[1:27:13] the so from the time of
[1:27:15] Abel God has always punished sin and
[1:27:21] Rebellion against his word and so it's
[1:27:26] not about a
[1:27:29] nationality see God will destroy all
[1:27:35] ungodliness he will he will destroy the
[1:27:38] ungodly Christian
[1:27:40] so-called he will destroy the ungodly
[1:27:43] Jew socalled he will destroy the ungodly
[1:27:47] Heathen see so you know and then of
[1:27:50] course heathens presumably the at least
[1:27:52] the ones down through time who responded
[1:27:55] to the word correctly enough you know in
[1:27:58] some way uh even perhaps if if it's just
[1:28:00] in nature alone they're they're going to
[1:28:03] be granted to be raised up in the
[1:28:05] Millennium to hear to have their chance
[1:28:07] to hear the gospel oh God's got a plan
[1:28:10] my goodness what a plan and then after a
[1:28:14] thousand years of peace on Earth comes
[1:28:16] that great and final Judgment of all
[1:28:19] Humanity from Genesis forward
[1:28:23] see so it's not about a nation it's
[1:28:26] brother Bram even talked about during
[1:28:28] the Holocaust how that he said it's not
[1:28:31] those those who are granted eternal life
[1:28:34] he said it's not a nation because they
[1:28:36] protected Jews because there was a
[1:28:38] number of European nations that took
[1:28:40] Jews in and brother brandham said that's
[1:28:42] not going to give their Nation a pass
[1:28:43] just like this land had the greatest
[1:28:45] Prophet never Strike since Paul that's
[1:28:47] not going to give America a
[1:28:49] pass because she rejected it you see so
[1:28:53] so not all Christians are real
[1:28:54] Christians not all Jews are real Jews
[1:28:56] not all Israel is real
[1:28:58] Israel understand so we don't get caught
[1:29:00] up in the
[1:29:02] political you understand we don't get
[1:29:05] caught up in the political that's not
[1:29:07] for us I know the plan of God I know who
[1:29:10] his people are I know what'll happen to
[1:29:12] Jerusalem Jerusalem will be the capital
[1:29:15] of Christ the King and Israel will be
[1:29:18] the re restored as the leading nation of
[1:29:20] the world that's
[1:29:22] prophecy but it's not the Wall Street
[1:29:25] guys it's those real children of Abraham
[1:29:29] it's not just C you joined a church or
[1:29:30] shook the preacher's hand but it's a
[1:29:32] bride who has given up her identity to
[1:29:35] Christ alone and she surrendered her
[1:29:38] mind and she's in tune with the word of
[1:29:41] God for this
[1:29:44] hour brother Brandon makes this
[1:29:46] statement and I started to put it in a
[1:29:48] PowerPoint but I didn't I just want to
[1:29:49] read it to you it's one quote from
[1:29:50] blessing prophet
[1:29:58] brother Kenny bring your team and come
[1:29:59] come on I want to read
[1:30:02] this CL don't don't run out the door now
[1:30:05] just let the team come don't be
[1:30:06] distracted I want you to listen I'm
[1:30:12] closing brother random says in blushing
[1:30:17] Prophet November the 25th in an evening
[1:30:19] service in 1956
[1:30:25] this is one of not
[1:30:28] the but this is one of the last
[1:30:33] sermons that the America will get to
[1:30:37] hear while she still has an opportunity
[1:30:40] to change
[1:30:41] course and repent as a nation and follow
[1:30:47] Christ sadly she doesn't take it 1957
[1:30:52] Dawns with America under an
[1:30:55] irreversible inescapable
[1:31:04] judgment so here's a prophet when I read
[1:31:06] this I thought Lord I'm going to include
[1:31:08] this in my sermon
[1:31:10] today
[1:31:11] because I want to
[1:31:20] identify
[1:31:23] I'm
[1:31:24] guilty that a way for a prophet to start
[1:31:28] I'm
[1:31:30] guilty I'm guilty of not
[1:31:33] doing the job of God like I should
[1:31:37] do I'm confessing it that I'm
[1:31:41] wrong I'm asking God to be merciful to
[1:31:48] me I look out here and see the
[1:31:50] opportunities that I have
[1:31:53] missed because of petty things little
[1:31:55] old insignificant things that didn't
[1:31:58] mean
[1:32:00] nothing I'm ashamed of myself as a
[1:32:04] gospel Minister before you I Repent
[1:32:07] before God and ask God to forgive me and
[1:32:12] the church to forgive me for being so
[1:32:16] dilatory about the work of
[1:32:19] God by the grace of God
[1:32:22] and by the help of God how many want
[1:32:25] that by the grace of God and by the help
[1:32:29] of God I'll not listen to what everyone
[1:32:33] trying to tell you something to do they
[1:32:36] got a program they got something for you
[1:32:38] to do nonsense I know God's program it's
[1:32:42] written out here in his Bible and I'm
[1:32:44] ashamed see brother brandom is trying to
[1:32:46] get away from the idea of not only men
[1:32:49] but even his own mind even his own self
[1:32:53] see and I I I and I when I go come to
[1:32:57] this again brother brandham gives a lot
[1:32:59] of detail about what happened to him in
[1:33:01] Africa and got trapped up in organized
[1:33:04] men who paid for his trip and he was and
[1:33:06] he was stuck because he didn't have
[1:33:07] enough money to get home and they wanted
[1:33:09] to change his itinerary and God told him
[1:33:10] not to do it and they pressured him and
[1:33:12] he did it Lord what can I do I'm trapped
[1:33:14] I'm stuck and the Lord said okay you do
[1:33:16] it but I I'll bless it however you're
[1:33:17] going to pay a hard price for
[1:33:19] it and I want to go I want to go to
[1:33:22] there in part
[1:33:24] three and he saysi know God's program
[1:33:27] it's written out here in the
[1:33:30] Bible I'm ashamed of myself as a
[1:33:32] minister of the
[1:33:34] Gospel 1 million Souls won I ought to
[1:33:37] have 10 million Souls one I'm way
[1:33:41] [Music]
[1:33:44] behind wow I can't hardly get my mind
[1:33:47] around saying that I ought a million
[1:33:49] Souls won and I still feel bad because
[1:33:53] it should have been 10
[1:33:59] million back in the
[1:34:03] day I used to write a lot of poetry
[1:34:05] writing is kind of what I do essays and
[1:34:08] things like that I excel at that thank
[1:34:10] the Lord have an easy time putting my
[1:34:12] thoughts to paper and I used
[1:34:15] to I used to be quite the Romantic amen
[1:34:18] sister Debbie has a stack of poetries to
[1:34:20] write to her
[1:34:22] and I would write it about other things
[1:34:23] as well anything that struck my
[1:34:26] fancy and uh once I caught
[1:34:30] her I didn't write it so much anymore
[1:34:33] and when my mother-in-law who I loved so
[1:34:37] greatly passed
[1:34:39] away and I was there you know with her
[1:34:42] in her last
[1:34:43] days and something happened somebody
[1:34:47] made a statement and I just caught I
[1:34:49] thought wow there's that old inspiration
[1:34:51] and I grabbed a piece of paper and just
[1:34:53] started writing and I wrote a
[1:34:56] poem and actually used it at
[1:34:59] her her funeral her memorial service and
[1:35:03] I read it and family appreciated it and
[1:35:05] I appreciated the Lord for
[1:35:07] it and it seemed like it opened up
[1:35:11] something and I I was thinking about
[1:35:13] this
[1:35:14] sermon and I wrote
[1:35:20] this it's it's two different versions of
[1:35:23] me there's a me and then there's a a
[1:35:26] real me there's a you that's this but
[1:35:29] there's another
[1:35:31] you and it's the other one that needs to
[1:35:34] be in
[1:35:35] control Amen brother B said I found out
[1:35:38] there was another William brandham who
[1:35:41] was not the son of Charles and Ella
[1:35:42] Branham but he was actually a son of
[1:35:45] almighty God come from the Jee pool of
[1:35:47] almighty God put your mind around that
[1:35:53] and so I wrote these
[1:35:56] words the
[1:35:58] me from
[1:36:00] he that was to be must be the he that
[1:36:06] leads this he you see would always be
[1:36:10] the all he planned for
[1:36:15] me it's me where all the troubles be
[1:36:19] where Falls and fails occur so I must
[1:36:24] learn to yield and bend to his Most
[1:36:28] Blessed
[1:36:29] yearn to place my trust in Powers High
[1:36:34] beyond what I can
[1:36:36] see what he would have for me to
[1:36:40] be would be the me
[1:36:42] [Music]
[1:36:47] of bow your heads with
[1:36:50] me
[1:36:51] Lord I Thank You for Your word
[1:36:55] today I thank you for helping me in in
[1:36:58] body and I could feel the enemy trying
[1:37:02] to shut it down but you just prevailed
[1:37:04] and we got through it and I got to the
[1:37:07] point where I felt like I
[1:37:09] could pause for
[1:37:11] today we'll pick it up again Lord if
[1:37:15] there is a
[1:37:17] tomorrow if there's not Lord for us and

[1:37:48] myself into your hands as I read the
[1:37:51] this read The Prophet's own
