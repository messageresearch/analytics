[4:49] [Music]
[5:12] good morning everyone God bless
[5:15] you we're going to continue on our
[5:18] subject this will be a word family part
[5:21] seven and uh we'll have I guess less of
[5:25] a PowerPoint this
[5:26] time but um want to continue on let's
[5:30] let's uh stand as we
[5:35] pray gracious Heavenly Father we just
[5:38] come before you Lord and we ask that
[5:39] your presence would be with us Lord that
[5:41] you would take your word Lord Make It
[5:44] Real to us make it alive to us
[5:48] Lord uh and help us to be conformed to
[5:51] what the word says not to what our
[5:54] thoughts our feelings or just a few
[5:56] steps behind what the world thinks Lord
[5:59] we commit our ourselves to You For Your
[6:00] Glory we ask it in Jesus name
[6:03] amen uh the first scripture we're going
[6:05] to turn to is in Malachi you can be
[6:08] seated is in Malachi chapter
[6:11] 2 and we're going to look at a few
[6:15] verses there as we turn there our
[6:17] brother Mark helps us get
[6:21] there kind of looking at some of the
[6:24] last few times we've done Sunday school
[6:27] just in a very brief before we start
[6:29] reading and kind of turn the subject a
[6:31] little bit it used to be where a man
[6:34] knew it was his job to protect his wife
[6:38] his daughters and a knew a woman knew it
[6:41] was her job to take care of her husband
[6:45] and her family this is should be for
[6:49] those who are readers of the Bible and
[6:51] Believers of the Bible such a basic
[6:54] truth it's almost as fun fundamental as
[6:57] simply believing that God exists amen if
[7:00] we believe that God exists we understand
[7:03] the order of the family and the Order of
[7:05] the home the pro the the let me before I
[7:08] get there because we have departed from
[7:12] this in our
[7:14] society what do we get now all honor
[7:18] respect
[7:20] dignity and modesty and the wisdom of
[7:23] Ages past has literally been thrown away
[7:26] to the point where you have to actually
[7:27] go and teach Christians
[7:30] again the first and very basics of these
[7:33] things and it becomes a shock to them
[7:36] many times and that's what you have
[7:37] under among so many different doctrines
[7:40] about ma manhood and Womanhood amongst
[7:43] all the denominational
[7:45] systems we've thrown it thrown all the
[7:49] constraints that the word of God puts
[7:52] upon us for our joy and His glory put
[7:56] that away and what are the results that
[7:58] we have we have a pornog Ric violent
[8:01] dishonorable danger Dangerous and evil
[8:04] culture that we're surrounded by and
[8:08] so when we when we lack this basic
[8:12] understanding uh it becomes it becomes a
[8:16] total perversion and secondarily is what
[8:19] we find many in the Christian world
[8:22] doing and it's a we can we can kid
[8:24] ourselves and think it's not a danger
[8:26] for us but what ends up happening is the
[8:30] world moves this way I'm going to use
[8:33] the left hand they move this way right
[8:37] and Christians go instead of saying this
[8:40] is God's unmovable unchangeable word I'm
[8:43] staying here and not moving from it they
[8:45] just go oh see I'm not as bad as them
[8:49] and you justify yourself in your own
[8:51] eyes and say we're we're doing it the
[8:54] right way when you're actually doing it
[8:57] not you're doing it the wrong way you're
[8:59] not staying on the immovable Rock of
[9:02] God's word you're sliding away and then
[9:05] comparing yourself with those who are
[9:08] evil degenerates and saying oh I'm
[9:10] better than them the standard is not
[9:13] better than them the standard is God's
[9:16] unchangeable word and his unchangeable
[9:19] purpose for us as
[9:22] individuals and anytime you deviate that
[9:25] the prophet taught us this anytime you
[9:26] deviate from the original word you're
[9:29] walking in
[9:31] perversion so justifying yourself that
[9:33] we're not as bad as the rest of them is
[9:36] not an answer that God is going to
[9:38] accept on the white at the white Throne
[9:40] judgment absolutely unacceptable excuse
[9:44] to say you know we've adjusted ourselves
[9:47] we've come we've come to the left on
[9:49] these issues we've moved to the left but
[9:53] we're still further to the right than
[9:54] the rest well I'd rather just stand here
[9:57] as a complete radical
[9:59] based solely upon God's word alone amen
[10:05] and whatever the consequences that the
[10:07] world wants to give to me I'm sorry I'm
[10:09] standing on God's
[10:11] word if it hurts your feelings if it
[10:14] hurt if it makes you emotional if it
[10:16] makes you want to march in the streets
[10:18] and show that prove that you're an
[10:20] unbeliever go ahead but here we stand we
[10:24] can do no other all right Malachi
[10:27] chapter 2 and we'll start at Reading at
[10:29] verse
[10:32] 14 yet ye say wherefore because the Lord
[10:36] has been witness between thee and the
[10:38] wife of thy youth against whom thou Hast
[10:41] dealt treacherously I want to pause and
[10:44] emphasize that word for a moment because
[10:46] you're going to see it come up again
[10:49] treacherously yet is she thy companion
[10:53] and the wife of thy Covenant so
[10:55] understand that marriage is actually a
[10:58] covenant amen
[11:00] between a man and a woman and they
[11:03] become husband and
[11:05] wife and they're they're they're
[11:08] therefore joined in a union and they're
[11:11] properly referred to as a
[11:15] companion right and to to go against
[11:19] your companion to go against the
[11:21] Covenant is to automatically deal
[11:25] treacherously in other words there is a
[11:28] debt of
[11:29] Allegiance and responsibility that a
[11:33] husband has to a wife and a wife has to
[11:36] a husband and when you don't fulfill
[11:38] that it is committing treason against
[11:41] the
[11:42] Covenant verse
[11:44] 15 and did not he make one yet had he
[11:49] the residue of the spirit so in other
[11:54] words he's saying he made husband and
[11:56] wife one he joined them together in the
[11:59] union and in that Union it was God that
[12:03] has the residue of the spirit he is the
[12:05] one by his spirit that joined man and
[12:08] woman together so when he joined Adam
[12:10] and Eve together what did he do he
[12:13] actually was showing what the rest of
[12:15] marriages is when a man and woman is
[12:18] joined together in a solemn vow before
[12:21] God in a covenant entering into a
[12:23] covenant together that he actually it's
[12:26] God himself that's joining the man and
[12:29] the woman together in that Covenant so
[12:33] the residue of the spirit is the one
[12:35] that's joining the two together just the
[12:38] same as he did with Adam and
[12:41] Eve verse 16 for the Lord the god of
[12:45] Israel oh go back to verse 15 I I didn't
[12:48] finish
[12:49] reading and wherefore one so why did he
[12:52] make them one why did he make them
[12:55] one that he might seek a Godly seed so
[13:00] there's a union there's a covenant
[13:02] there's a companionship and what did God
[13:05] make them one
[13:08] for to multiply and fill up the Earth
[13:11] but not just with humans that wasn't
[13:15] God's purpose he wanted to fill it up
[13:17] with a Godly
[13:19] seed so the function and if we can
[13:22] understand this the function and purpose
[13:24] of the marriage covenant is to produce a
[13:27] Godly seed
[13:29] this is God's purpose and God's program
[13:33] within that Covenant so if you produce
[13:36] an ungodly seed we're failing in the
[13:39] purpose amen of course we must do our
[13:42] part the rest is up to God we can't give
[13:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost to their
[13:47] CH to our children you can raise Godly
[13:49] you can do every step correctly in your
[13:52] home and produce a child that Rebels
[13:55] against almighty God because that's the
[13:57] nature of every one of us until we get
[14:00] the Holy Ghost and our Nature has
[14:03] changed but you should at least do your
[14:05] job and your duty to raise Godly seed
[14:09] amen because at at least in that place
[14:12] you can meet the Lord and say I've done
[14:13] honorably by my family I've raised them
[14:16] right I left them in your hands Lord you
[14:20] have actually promised me that if I did
[14:22] that they would eventually come back to
[14:25] the way that they were trained in so I'm
[14:26] holding you accountable father Amen to
[14:29] bring my children into the Covenant that
[14:32] they were born
[14:35] in then then the the pro the Lord
[14:38] speaking by the prophet says therefore
[14:40] take heed to your spirit that you deal
[14:44] not
[14:46] treacherously there's that word
[14:49] again you have wearied the Lord with
[14:52] your words verse 17 yet ye say wherein
[14:56] have we wearied him when you say
[15:00] everyone that do does evil is good in
[15:02] the sight of the Lord and He delighteth
[15:04] in them where is the god of judgment
[15:08] amen all right so God hates
[15:13] divorce because it's the breaking of a
[15:16] covenant that he has made between
[15:19] husband and wife that's from the end of
[15:21] verse 16 God hates putting away let's go
[15:25] back to 16 cuz again I started
[15:27] expositing on it and skipped over 3ars
[15:30] of
[15:31] it the god of Israel saith that he
[15:35] hateth putting away for one
[15:39] coverthe the Lord of hosts therefore
[15:41] take heed to your spirit that you deal
[15:43] not treacherously so the ultimate
[15:46] treason of marriage is
[15:48] divorce is when the marriage covenant is
[15:51] broken Now understand that this isn't
[15:56] you have you have to understand that
[15:58] when a man man abuses his wife he's
[16:01] actually breaking his marriage covenant
[16:04] he's broken it if his wife leaves she's
[16:07] justified in leaving because he himself
[16:10] has violated his duty of marriage
[16:15] amen so you have to understand that
[16:17] there is more to being treacherous than
[16:20] just
[16:23] divorce twice in this these series of
[16:25] verses God says men have dealt
[16:28] treacherously with their
[16:31] wives instead of dealing with that with
[16:33] them as your with your companion and one
[16:36] whom you have entered into a
[16:38] covenant with you are dealing
[16:41] treacherously with her treacherous means
[16:43] to betray a trust or to violate an
[16:47] allegiance it speaks of neglect of your
[16:51] duties towards the Covenant you have
[16:53] entered into with your
[16:57] wife the Bible speaks of many duties of
[17:00] a man to his wife and again these we we
[17:04] we think as modern people duty this is
[17:08] your duty we immediately think oh that's
[17:11] not a good thing let's understand it
[17:13] this way Brothers you sisters your your
[17:17] duty should be your Delight if you have
[17:20] the Holy Ghost your you joyfully enter
[17:25] into your duty right it isn't a
[17:28] difficult thing now it can become a
[17:29] difficult thing um if you're deal
[17:32] sometimes you're dealing with difficult
[17:34] people sometimes you're dealing with a
[17:37] difficult husband a difficult wife
[17:39] nevertheless your faith should be
[17:41] connected to God in such a way that you
[17:44] understand even as a as a husband your
[17:47] wife is behaving the wrong way your duty
[17:51] is to God yeah amen as a wife if your
[17:55] husband is behaving in a certain way
[17:58] again your duty is to God you don't have
[18:01] neither none of us have a right to
[18:03] disobey God because our husband is
[18:06] behaving wrong now again we have
[18:08] boundaries we've mentioned abuse
[18:11] before you don't let anyone abuse you
[18:15] amen either side verbally emotionally
[18:20] physically amen you remove yourself from
[18:22] the situation and that's wisdom and that
[18:25] in itself is loving
[18:27] God because God asks us to tell people
[18:30] no to tell to to tell people stop to not
[18:34] allow them to force you into something
[18:38] that is
[18:40] ungodly uh you know the scripture says
[18:43] wives obey your husbands in the Lord
[18:47] right so if your husband is telling you
[18:49] to do something that's contrary to the
[18:51] word you don't owe obedience to your
[18:52] husband your obedience to God and the
[18:56] vice versa goes if a if a man is being
[18:59] uh forced and nagged by his wife into
[19:02] doing something ungodly he he he is Duty
[19:05] bound before God to correct her and to
[19:09] say no and back
[19:11] away but the the there in Exodus 21:10
[19:14] it shows us that a man has a duty to
[19:16] provide food clothing and the duty of
[19:20] marriage to his
[19:24] wife the duty of marriage of course
[19:26] speaks of the cohabitation or conjugal
[19:29] rights of the marriage bed and so when
[19:33] men begin to neglect these
[19:35] obligations that they have towards their
[19:37] wife it creates a
[19:40] situation where wives will then be are
[19:43] being injured by their
[19:46] husbands perhaps not physically but
[19:48] they're being they're they're receiving
[19:50] a a spiritual and a moral injury by
[19:54] their husbands and what ends up
[19:56] happening with this is a woman will
[19:59] become resentful of her
[20:02] husband when he is not performing the
[20:06] duties that God has obligated him to and
[20:10] when she becomes resentful more than
[20:13] likely uh she'll either emotionally
[20:16] check out of the marriage or she will
[20:19] become his worst
[20:23] nightmare it's sin in men to neglect
[20:26] their
[20:27] wives it's sinful
[20:29] we have to be sure that we understand
[20:31] that it's sinful for women to resent and
[20:35] to nag their husbands I have scripture
[20:38] we'll go through it both of these sides
[20:41] but but but the real thing is that
[20:44] men are tending towards neglecting their
[20:49] wives both literally and emotionally
[20:52] yeah and this is a great danger um it
[20:56] even speaks of be not bitter against
[20:58] them and we'll cover that as we get let
[21:01] go go later in
[21:02] this but at the center of marriage is
[21:06] two people who have a sinful nature in
[21:08] them therefore we understand that
[21:12] repentance is an important part of
[21:15] marriage oh yeah we can't minimize sin
[21:20] amen we can't say oh it's not that big
[21:23] of a deal I didn't mean
[21:25] to we can't take that attitude you might
[21:29] have not meant to but you still did it
[21:32] therefore whether you meant to or not is
[21:34] Irrelevant in the sight of man therefore
[21:37] repentance is required and if if we
[21:40] forget this part we become proud men men
[21:43] have a huge tend everyone does but
[21:46] especially men have a tendency towards
[21:48] pride and arrogance and they don't want
[21:50] to be corrected and they don't want to
[21:53] repent but a real man will repent and
[21:56] ask for forgiveness from his wife if he
[21:59] sins if he doesn't perform the duties
[22:01] that God has placed upon Him correctly
[22:03] or he does them with the wrong attitude
[22:06] it's necessary to repent for a wife she
[22:09] can't she also needs to repent if she's
[22:12] nagging him
[22:13] continuously as the Bible says like a
[22:15] continual dropping upon him um if she is
[22:20] being loud boisterous rude to him well
[22:24] she needs to repent also it's sin in her
[22:28] she can't can't say well my husband
[22:30] didn't do this that might be true but
[22:32] you did this and therefore you're wrong
[22:34] and you must repent and it's between you
[22:37] and you and God your husband also will
[22:40] answer too if he's the if he's the cause
[22:42] of it you'll answer and he'll answer if
[22:45] he's not performing his duties and
[22:48] you're becoming resentful and nagging
[22:52] well you're going to answer for being
[22:53] resentful and nagging and he's going to
[22:56] answer for neglecting you and for
[22:59] causing you to be neglectful amen and
[23:05] nagging well amen
[23:08] anyway Proverbs 12:4 by now you should
[23:11] show up and and be able to uh take it on
[23:14] the chin from my Sunday
[23:17] schools I'm taking it
[23:20] too Proverbs 12:4 a virtuous woman is a
[23:23] crown to her husband amen a virtuous
[23:27] woman is one that follows the order of
[23:29] the family and home that God has laid
[23:31] out walking in obedience to God and her
[23:34] husband fulfilling her duties that God
[23:36] has assigned her as a wife and mother
[23:38] and keep her at home with the fruit of
[23:41] the spirit and also keeping those three
[23:44] sacred trusts in order in her own
[23:48] life oh the verse goes on but she makes
[23:52] a shame be she that maketh ashamed is as
[23:55] rottenness to his bones yes am an
[23:58] immodest woman that is loud rude would
[24:02] as brother brandham said would rather
[24:03] have a dog or a cat to raise than
[24:07] children says my husband must obey me
[24:11] I'm taking these from quotes I don't
[24:13] obey him he must obey me this woman is
[24:16] rottenness in his bones and he would be
[24:21] ashamed because of her her behavior
[24:25] would bring shame upon him in the sight
[24:29] of the
[24:31] public Proverbs
[24:35] 18:22 who so findeth a wife findeth a
[24:39] good thing and obtains favor of the Lord
[24:42] a
[24:43] sign of God's favor on a man's life is
[24:46] when he finds a Godly wife it shows the
[24:49] priorities are correct remember brother
[24:52] branam instructs you should be looking
[24:54] for character in The choosing of a bride
[24:57] not with whether they're pretty first
[25:00] look at their character and they're the
[25:01] kind of person that you want to build a
[25:03] home around and he says and then after
[25:05] that if she's
[25:06] pretty it's not a prior that should not
[25:09] be your first line of priority because
[25:12] if your first line of priority is
[25:14] physical Beauty what are you what are
[25:17] you going to
[25:18] get you don't
[25:20] know you don't know there's no guarantee
[25:22] on that God might work a miracle but I I
[25:25] wouldn't count on our stupidity
[25:28] causing a
[25:31] miracle I would look for character I
[25:35] would look for a a young lady that is
[25:38] working towards fulfilling the three
[25:41] sacred trusts that of a woman that
[25:43] brother brandham speaks
[25:46] about that would be the that would be
[25:48] the first priority and secondarily it
[25:53] would be the leading of the holy spirit
[25:56] so first of all it has to be the right
[25:59] type of young lady and vice versa has to
[26:02] be right type of young man if you're if
[26:05] the young ladies are looking to young
[26:07] man that are come coming to to court
[26:10] them they should think how does he treat
[26:13] his mother how does he treat uh his
[26:17] sisters am that's right uh he should
[26:20] look and say she should look and say
[26:22] what kind of work ethic does he
[26:25] have what kind of strength does he have
[26:30] is he is he a
[26:31] weakling does he not have uh be able to
[26:35] take any kind of spiritual leadership or
[26:37] authority is there any sign of that so
[26:40] you should be looking first for
[26:42] character because it's uh he that finds
[26:46] a wife finds a good thing and obtains
[26:48] favor of the
[26:50] Lord but we we have scripture to show us
[26:53] that if you find an
[26:55] ungodly woman you find the worst thing
[26:59] you find rottenness for your bones
[27:02] rottenness in Bones means there's no
[27:05] structure there's there's no there's no
[27:07] order to your body you're just droopy
[27:10] and and
[27:11] weak and it's a horrible
[27:14] thing and so young women look for
[27:18] character amen young men look for
[27:22] character secondly find the leadership
[27:25] of the holy spirit in your own personal
[27:28] life and young ladies of course many
[27:30] times we forget to mention this but the
[27:31] scripture shows that your father is
[27:33] supposed to be involved in your dating
[27:37] life am seek the counsel first of your
[27:40] father about this young man your
[27:42] emotions might be swayed in a thousand
[27:44] different ways but I'm pretty sure your
[27:45] dad's emotions won't
[27:48] be and that is that's why it's critical
[27:51] and that's why the scripture puts forth
[27:53] a father as the deciding factor in the
[27:56] home and in the
[28:00] family Proverbs 19: 13-
[28:05] 14 a foolish son is a is the Calamity of
[28:09] his father and the contentions of a wife
[28:12] are a continual
[28:13] dropping house and riches are in the
[28:16] inheritance of fathers and a Prudent
[28:18] Wife is from the Lord so house and
[28:22] riches inherited by sons comes from
[28:26] Godly fathers yeah uh I think the
[28:30] scripture says a good man lays up an
[28:34] inheritance for his children's
[28:37] children but then on the vice versa a
[28:39] foolish son is the Calamity of his
[28:41] father look at look at
[28:44] David I think he produced a few foolish
[28:48] Sons why because he was the scripture
[28:51] even tells us he was afraid to displease
[28:54] them he didn't want to displease them
[28:57] well
[28:58] dads I'm going to tell you right now you
[29:00] got to spend a lot of time displeasing
[29:03] your children if you want to produce
[29:05] good ones amen as we understand too much
[29:09] if you too much good for your children
[29:12] spoils them and
[29:15] produces Calamity the Calamity of his
[29:18] father right Absalom is a perfect
[29:20] example he refused to correct
[29:23] Absalom didn't want to displease Absalom
[29:26] what was the results
[29:28] of that his own son supplanted him and
[29:33] even took his concubines to shame
[29:35] him this is a Calamity of of David from
[29:39] his his desire to not displease his sons
[29:43] we have to displease our children
[29:48] amen we have to bring them bad news
[29:51] sorry we're taking your phone away sorry
[29:53] you're grounded sorry you're getting a
[29:56] spanking they need they kids need
[29:58] boundaries and they need correction and
[30:00] without them they will be
[30:07] monsters praise the Lord
[30:10] amen all right that's Fathers and
[30:13] Sons um and then he speaks in the same
[30:17] verses of wives so the contentions of a
[30:21] wife are a continual
[30:24] dropping so what does that mean it's
[30:27] referring
[30:28] to a house that is in dis
[30:31] disrepair so this house is in
[30:34] disrepair and as a result you have water
[30:37] leaking on your head from the rain that
[30:41] is coming in outside so there's a
[30:44] contentious wife and when there's a
[30:46] contentious wife what is the
[30:50] results what is the results it's a it
[30:53] shows that there's a house in disrepair
[30:56] amen
[30:58] it shows that it's open to the elements
[31:02] of Evil coming in to the
[31:05] home so many times if you realize that a
[31:08] wife is a reflection of her husband he's
[31:11] the image of God she's the image of
[31:14] man therefore we're men men are a
[31:17] reflection of God As Leaders in the home
[31:20] and women are a reflection of men as
[31:23] helpers in the home so if she is
[31:25] contentious
[31:28] it's not 100% true all the time
[31:31] sometimes a woman is just
[31:33] contentious for whatever reason perhaps
[31:36] she was um
[31:38] mistreated uh in her life and she fears
[31:41] to trust a man and she feels that she
[31:44] must control him whatever whatever the
[31:48] reason might be it shows a home that's
[31:50] out of order and in
[31:51] disrepair and it becomes a continual
[31:54] dropping upon the head of a man and
[31:57] again if if we understand the marriage
[32:00] relationship a husband will answer for
[32:02] his wife amen a husband will answer for
[32:06] the atmosphere that he has in his home
[32:08] the wife will secondarily but the
[32:11] husband is responsible for that God
[32:14] places the responsib responsibility
[32:16] squarely upon him so he must solve this
[32:20] problem in his home of a contentious
[32:23] wife by first fixing himself
[32:28] so that this contentious woman will give
[32:32] him a moment of Peace because he's
[32:35] living in such a way that she honors and
[32:37] respects him now she should repent and
[32:40] stop being a contentious woman even if
[32:42] he is an orinary mean jerk of a
[32:47] man because she will answer to God for
[32:49] her own
[32:51] behavior but it's if we understand as
[32:54] Christians as real men of God it's our
[32:57] duty to set the atmosphere of our home
[32:59] it's our duty to correct our wife and
[33:01] our children and to set things in order
[33:04] and do it in a way right amen that's not
[33:07] abusive not harmful but is with love and
[33:11] spiritual growth at the center of all of
[33:15] it and the second part is the blessing
[33:17] is a Prudent Wife a wife with wisdom a
[33:21] wife with faith a wife that is not
[33:24] fearful of the times to come as Proverbs
[33:27] said but trusts in God now that is a
[33:30] gift from the Lord the Lord has sent
[33:33] that woman to you as a blessing to help
[33:36] you to strengthen you and to Stand By
[33:39] Your Side
[33:41] amen praise the
[33:43] Lord Proverbs 7:
[33:49] 11 speaking of the ungodly woman she's
[33:52] loud and stubborn her feet abide not in
[33:55] her
[33:56] house 1 Peter 3 shows us that the proper
[34:00] adornment of a sister is a Meek and
[34:04] quiet
[34:05] Spirit Meek does not speak of being weak
[34:09] right though she is the weaker vessel
[34:12] God doesn't ordain that women be weak
[34:15] amen not be weak in faith and not be
[34:18] weak in body just weaker than men right
[34:22] in in
[34:23] comparison Meek doesn't speak of that it
[34:26] speaks of something different
[34:28] remember that we Moses was the meekest
[34:31] man upon all the Earth why was he the
[34:33] meekest man because he was the most
[34:35] easily led by the
[34:37] Lord and and meekness speaks as she's
[34:40] willing to be led and God has built this
[34:43] into the nature of a woman is a it is a
[34:46] desire to be led by a Godly
[34:49] Man and the next part of it is a quiet
[34:52] spirit so these things like Proverbs 711
[34:56] is the
[34:58] antithesis of what God desires from the
[35:01] character of a woman he doesn't want her
[35:04] adorning to be loud and stubborn and to
[35:07] not abide in her house he desires that
[35:10] she have a Meek and a quiet
[35:13] Spirit it says in the sight of God it is
[35:16] of Great Value this attitude this
[35:20] attribute is of Great Value not being
[35:22] loud and
[35:23] stubborn but having that Meek and quiet
[35:26] spirit Colossians
[35:28] 3:19 husbands love your wives and be not
[35:31] bitter against
[35:33] them I've got to close even if your wife
[35:36] tries to control you and nag you it's
[35:38] your obedience to God not to be bitter
[35:41] against your
[35:42] wife as as a godly man you can't respond
[35:46] to other people in kind you respond as
[35:49] God leads you and speaks to you and
[35:51] deals with you all right so bitterness
[35:55] towards your wife speaks of
[35:59] literally
