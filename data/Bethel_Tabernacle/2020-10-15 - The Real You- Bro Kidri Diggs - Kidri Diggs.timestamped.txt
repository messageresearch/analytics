[42:04] bible says by faith
[42:06] moses when he was born was his
[42:09] three months of his parents because they
[42:12] saw he was
[42:13] a proper child and they were not afraid
[42:16] of the king's commandment and by faith
[42:19] moses when he was
[42:21] come to years refused to be called the
[42:24] son of pharaoh's daughter
[42:25] choosing whether to suffer affliction
[42:28] with the people of god

[42:33] season esteeming

[43:22] it were given unto him of my father from
[43:25] that time many of him
[43:27] many of his disciples went back and
[43:30] walked no more
[43:31] with him then said jesus unto the twelve
[43:34] will ye also go away
[43:36] then simon peter answered him lord to
[43:38] whom shall we go
[43:40] thou has the words of eternal life
[43:43] and when and we believe and
[43:46] are sure that thou art the christ the
[43:49] son of the living god
[43:51] jesus answered them have not i chosen
[43:55] you twelve
[43:56] and one of you is a devil and you read
[43:59] the lord and bless you is where you can
[44:01] have your seats
[44:06] amen by the grace of god i want to use
[44:07] for a subject tonight
[44:09] the real you amen the real
[44:13] you you know and and and if i could just
[44:16] start this way
[44:18] we know uh because of our christian
[44:21] journey
[44:22] that this flesh is not who we really are
[44:26] amen this flesh is just it's this flesh
[44:29] is here
[44:30] to connect with us earth hallelujah but
[44:33] there's a part of you as you go on your
[44:37] journey
[44:38] that remains to be revealed but one
[44:41] thing i wanna i wanna uh
[44:43] deal with tonight if we can just catch
[44:45] it
[44:46] you know if you look at the scriptures
[44:48] right here it says
[44:49] listen to jesus talking to all these
[44:51] people and he says
[44:54] but there are some of you that believe
[44:56] not
[44:57] see jesus you know he let people gather
[44:59] among believers
[45:00] you know the bible says let the two be
[45:03] grown together
[45:04] let the two raise up together and he
[45:06] said when that time come
[45:08] he's gonna separate them amen but you
[45:10] know you and i
[45:11] it's not our job to find out who is who
[45:15] our job is to live what we believe
[45:17] hallelujah
[45:18] but you know we spend so much time being
[45:21] distracted
[45:22] by the unbeliever being revealed right
[45:25] we are not to be distracted by that
[45:28] because jesus
[45:29] already knows who believes and who
[45:31] doesn't
[45:33] as long as you are sure who you are
[45:36] that's what counts amen but you know he
[45:38] said
[45:39] you know that that and you know the
[45:41] thing about the scripture
[45:42] when you watch jesus talk and even the
[45:44] prophet said jesus would throw things
[45:47] out there
[45:48] just to thin down the crowd he'd say
[45:51] things just so
[45:52] the real people can come out and show
[45:54] themselves
[45:56] hallelujah he'd say things that would be
[45:58] a stumbling block
[45:59] to some and be a blessing to others amen
[46:02] even our prophet did the same thing you
[46:04] know we got things on record
[46:06] where he said 737 000 but you know
[46:10] he wanted to go back and correct it and
[46:11] god said leave it alone
[46:15] why did god say leave it alone because
[46:17] he knew
[46:18] there was going to be some intellectuals
[46:21] in the midst of this simple bride
[46:23] that would take something like that that
[46:25] doesn't mean the hillary beings
[46:28] like you ain't never made a mistake i
[46:30] ain't never made a mistake
[46:32] we all have made mistakes but that
[46:34] doesn't change
[46:35] who we are all right the mistake does
[46:38] not change
[46:39] hunger the embedding of the seed that
[46:42] god put inside of you
[46:43] before the foundation of the world yeah
[46:45] amen what we do we see people make
[46:47] mistakes and all these things
[46:49] and then we start wavering and you know
[46:52] what i love about god
[46:53] god will let the superstars in your
[46:56] wreath
[46:56] fall
[47:01] he'll let those people uh that you
[47:04] respect
[47:05] those people that you put on a pedestal
[47:07] seem and look like they're crazy
[47:09] so you could worship him and him only
[47:13] amen but you know when we look at
[47:15] becoming the real you
[47:17] and and even in in matthew
[47:21] uh 24 let's go there right quick matthew
[47:24] 24.
[47:28] matthew 24 and verse 24. this is what
[47:31] the bible says
[47:33] he says are you with me amen
[47:37] hallelujah he says for there shall arise
[47:40] false christs and false prophets it
[47:42] shall show great signs and wonders
[47:44] if so much that if it were possible look
[47:48] if it were possible let's not change the
[47:51] scripture
[47:52] he didn't say it was possible he said
[47:55] if it were possible hallelujah that they
[47:59] shall deceive
[48:00] the very elect now listen church god
[48:04] let unbelievers walk right among
[48:06] believers
[48:07] and do signs and wonders heal the sick
[48:10] raise the dead even preach the message
[48:13] of the hour amen but the supernatural
[48:18] does
[48:28] [Music]
[48:30] just another prophet he was walking with
[48:33] god himself
[48:34] yes and that didn't change who he was
[48:38] he wasn't feasting on just a partial
[48:40] revelation
[48:41] he was fishing on thus said the lord
[48:48] he was under ministry without mistake
[48:51] and he still couldn't turn
[48:53] amen he was under
[48:57] ministry that knew no wrong and done no
[48:59] wrong and he still couldn't be converted
[49:02] amen amen see when it's time for the
[49:06] real you to come out
[49:07] you gonna blossom you're gonna blossom
[49:11] me no matter
[49:12] what your surroundings are it don't
[49:14] matter how long you've been in the world
[49:15] whatever the case might be
[49:16] when your time comes you will blossom
[49:21] whether it be a good tree bringing forth
[49:24] good fruit
[49:24] because you know what my bible says a
[49:27] good tree can't break for a bad fruit
[49:29] [Music]
[49:42] neither can an evil tree bring forth
[49:44] good fruit
[49:46] that tree breathes forth of the life
[49:49] within honor
[49:50] think about it let's look at judas for a
[49:52] second can you imagine honey
[49:55] look at it you talk about a hypocrite
[49:57] sure
[49:58] can you imagine walking with the church
[50:01] being something that you're not
[50:03] walking with the church hallelujah
[50:06] seeing people receive grace
[50:08] and mercy and all these things knowing
[50:10] hallelujah that you don't believe it
[50:13] hey man that was judas now
[50:17] remember my topic my thought the real
[50:19] you hungry
[50:21] church no matter how how much
[50:24] he would have wanted to believe he
[50:26] couldn't
[50:28] because the real him was an unbeliever
[50:32] and it doesn't matter hallelujah how
[50:34] many quotes you got
[50:35] how many scriptures you got if you're
[50:37] not ordained before the foundation of
[50:39] the world with the life of christ
[50:41] what is the life of christ zoe god's
[50:44] very own life
[50:45] inside of you it don't matter how long
[50:47] you've been in church
[50:48] 30 years later the real you will come
[50:51] out
[50:52] amen amen
[51:03] i just want to let you know right now
[51:05] we're in a time
[51:06] where you can't hide right
[51:10] and god has allowed these kind of things
[51:12] to take place
[51:13] the pandemic and so forth so the real
[51:16] you can come out
[51:18] some people are staying home and they're
[51:20] saying because we went mass at church
[51:22] i ain't coming that's the real them
[51:24] right
[51:26] it ain't the mask that made them feel
[51:28] that way no that's who they really are
[51:31] when people turn around on god and they
[51:34] point their finger at mattel
[51:35] brother chisholm or brother jason with
[51:37] the ministry no you ain't mad at me
[51:39] it's just the real you coming out
[51:43] hallelujah so curtis every life
[51:47] breaks forth of his own kind the
[51:50] scripture says
[51:51] whose seed is in his head so we have to
[51:54] think twice
[51:55] when we have certain actions and we do
[51:57] certain things all right hallelujah
[51:58] what are we projecting are we protecting
[52:00] christ are we rejecting something else
[52:03] amen
[52:03] because you can only hungry bring forth
[52:05] the life that's within you
[52:08] and if this pandemic has stopped you
[52:10] from coming to church
[52:12] if jesus was in front of you you steal
[52:14] amen
[52:16] amen you know what people say all the
[52:19] time brother man
[52:20] oh boy if i was in jesus dead man we'll
[52:22] be in revival
[52:24] we're in jesus day right now
[52:27] and what you're doing now is what you'll
[52:29] be doing if jesus was standing right in
[52:31] front of you
[52:32] preaching because we preached by the
[52:34] same spirit
[52:36] amen hallelujah he said oh if i was his
[52:41] dead
[52:42] i have more love no you wouldn't
[52:46] cause you got to realize yeah those same
[52:48] spirits
[52:49] were back then why do we think paul had
[52:52] to take
[52:53] chapters on preaching about love amen
[52:56] because there were people back then
[52:57] who could love so if you get love right
[53:00] now
[53:00] don't tell me if you were back then you
[53:02] would do it those scriptures was written
[53:04] about that spirit
[53:05] yeah right and that same spirit is still
[53:08] moving upon the earth
[53:09] just like back then there are scriptures
[53:12] of faith
[53:13] if you're operating now on those
[53:14] scriptures of faith you'll be back there
[53:17] operating the little scriptures of faith
[53:22] time does not change
[53:32] we're changed by what we believe
[53:36] we're changing hallelujah by what we
[53:39] receive
[53:45] you know look at the scripture you know
[53:48] i just want i just want to hit some
[53:49] things
[53:50] some things that keep me on my knees
[53:52] listen to this the bible says in
[53:54] first peter first peter uh chapter four
[53:58] listen it says and if the righteous
[54:01] scares me be saved
[54:06] you me us who consider ourselves
[54:11] to have the holy ghost serving the lord
[54:13] the bible says
[54:14] if we scarcely be saved amen
[54:22] amen
[54:30] he says where shall the ungodly and the
[54:32] sinner appear
[54:34] for those people who take things in his
[54:36] bible and put it aside and say
[54:38] well i love god you know my heart if the
[54:42] righteous
[54:42] barely make it in how you people
[54:47] amen amen how are the ones
[54:51] who don't have that consecration how are
[54:54] the ones
[54:55] who don't have that dedication how are
[54:57] the ones who can't accept the word
[54:59] for what it is gonna make it easy
[55:03] how are the ones who can take different
[55:05] things in the bible and take it out
[55:07] holiday and consider themselves serving
[55:10] god
[55:10] making him according to the scripture it
[55:13] says the righteous
[55:14] scarcely make it in yeah amen
[55:20] god allows these things to make
[55:24] sure listen to me to make sure
[55:28] we are in desperation
[55:32] look if certain things have to happen to
[55:35] put you in desperation
[55:36] you're you're a step behind amen
[55:40] you should already be in desperation
[55:43] this hour is calling for you
[55:45] to be desperate because you don't want
[55:47] to get caught down here
[55:49] you don't want to be left down here
[55:51] because we all got things in our lives
[55:54] that we're praying about we all got
[55:56] shortcomings we all got things
[55:58] that we're not happy about but do you
[56:00] sell them
[56:01] come on with those things in your life
[56:03] yes amen
[56:05] hallelujah
[56:10] let's look at the real you for a second
[56:13] look the bible says by faith
[56:16] moses he refused
[56:20] to be called the son of pharaoh's
[56:22] daughter right
[56:24] how did moses get to that place well
[56:27] let's backtrack look
[56:30] pharaoh sent out a degree that he gonna
[56:31] kill all the young babies right
[56:33] talk to me church he's gonna kill all
[56:35] the young male babies
[56:37] all right so anytime y'all know i love
[56:39] preaching about pressure
[56:42] i love pictures about trials and
[56:44] tribulations because we think sometimes
[56:46] because we bribe
[56:47] we're supposed to go through nothing
[56:49] right we think sometimes because we know
[56:51] the seals are opening
[56:53] we know uh the church ages and we we
[56:55] know the mysteries of god
[56:56] that they're still not a perfecting for
[56:58] us
[57:00] they're still perfecting amen amen
[57:02] hallelujah
[57:03] and if you want to be like god you're
[57:06] going to be tried
[57:07] until you get out of here amen
[57:11] but i want to look at my child
[57:14] how god looks at him oh yeah and god
[57:16] looks at him as a blessing
[57:18] god puts certain things in our lives to
[57:21] make us stronger
[57:22] god puts certain things our lives so our
[57:24] eyes can come open hallelujah
[57:26] god put certain things in our lives so
[57:29] you can get rid of the stuffiness
[57:31] the dryness the anger and all these
[57:33] other things
[57:34] that's hindering our walk
[57:36] [Music]
[57:37] that's good so god put pressure on you
[57:40] what is he doing
[57:41] he's trying to bring out the real you
[57:45] listen church without cold days that
[57:48] tree will never grow
[57:53] amen that tree needs a cold
[57:57] dry season a season where it looks like
[58:01] there is no life
[58:04] looks like it has nothing to give looks
[58:07] like it's all
[58:08] alone looks like it's bad but it needs
[58:11] that
[58:13] to bring forth life
[58:14] [Music]
[58:19] and in that time when that tree looks
[58:21] like it's struggling
[58:23] the roots are going deeper
[58:27] amen right that's why the bible says
[58:29] count it all joy
[58:33] when you're tempted no
[58:37] count it all joy when you fall
[58:44] into diverse temptations holy
[58:48] amen because the bible says with every
[58:50] temptation he's made a way of escape
[58:52] amen so god will let you fall into
[58:55] things
[58:56] that he know you can get out of it so
[58:58] you can call for mercy
[59:02] then god comes and shows you mercy so
[59:05] the next time you ever get into
[59:06] something
[59:07] you know that there is a way out
[59:11] hallelujah god has two twins
[59:14] sitting there by his side waiting to be
[59:17] dispatched for our lives
[59:18] those twins are named grace and mercy
[59:21] [Music]
[59:22] and with every trial god sees those
[59:25] twins by our way
[59:26] to give us grace and mercy
[59:30] amen thank you but we go through and we
[59:33] say lord why me
[59:34] don't you want to be real amen amen
[59:38] for something to be real it has to go
[59:40] through a trial and era
[59:42] oh yeah right sure
[59:46] like i said every vehicle i did in the
[59:49] parking lot
[59:50] on that side of the side they had to go
[59:52] through a crash test
[59:56] your field can be your vehicle can be 30
[59:59] thousand dollars more than mine
[1:00:00] but it still had to be wrecked yeah
[1:00:03] right
[1:00:05] before it even was used it had to be
[1:00:07] wrecked
[1:00:08] before the passengers ever got inside it
[1:00:11] had to be wrecked hallelujah
[1:00:12] but what god did but look at what they
[1:00:14] did what they did was
[1:00:16] when they wrecked it they put a dummy
[1:00:18] inside of them amen
[1:00:23] something that resembles you something
[1:00:25] that looks like you
[1:00:26] something that has your same weight
[1:00:28] class to some of you young people
[1:00:30] hallelujah
[1:00:31] to my daughters some of you to your
[1:00:32] children we've already been your crash

[1:02:39] tribulation her
[1:02:40] trial hallelujah put her in a position

[1:09:30] moses his life was just beginning
[1:09:34] amen
[1:09:39] seemed like he was from under all the
[1:09:42] protection he needed
[1:09:43] and he was down here with the enemy but
[1:09:45] the enemy was going to protect him
[1:09:47] yeah amen same thing he's smarter than
[1:09:50] god amen

[1:09:55] real good
[1:09:56] god let most of us be raised up with
[1:09:59] shock
[1:10:15] shock that we respected there was some
[1:10:17] shock and even witness to us
[1:10:26] look when she should have killed moses
[1:10:30] the bible said she had compassion
[1:10:33] oh glory to god my god is good
[1:10:38] see church even though she was an
[1:10:40] egyptian in that moment
[1:10:42] the real hair came out what was she she
[1:10:44] was a woman
[1:10:45] that wanted a child amen
[1:10:49] god know what he doing amen
[1:10:52] why didn't he sing why didn't he send
[1:10:54] the baby to pharaoh's daughter
[1:10:57] hands me no it went straight to
[1:10:58] pharaoh's daughter
[1:11:00] because the handmaid wouldn't have the
[1:11:02] compassion that she would have had
[1:11:07] amen so now look at her church
[1:11:14] she runs up to to pharaoh's daughters
[1:11:16] hey

[1:11:20] come on
[1:11:22] what are the chances that she can go

[1:11:30] or go find a woman that's willing
[1:11:33] to nurse the child yeah amen
[1:11:36] what are the chances see she had to be
[1:11:39] connected some kind of way
[1:11:41] so she goes and say okay i'll go get one
[1:11:43] of the hebrew mothers
[1:11:45] i'll go get one of them for you to go
[1:11:46] nurse she said yes my child go through
[1:11:48] that and she said i'm gonna get my momma
[1:11:51] gonna get my momma
[1:12:00] let me ask you something when you
[1:12:02] dedicate your life to god
[1:12:04] what is satan going to do with the gods
[1:12:06] you serve
[1:12:07] [Music]

[1:12:22] [Music]
[1:12:24] amen all god is trying to do is break
[1:12:27] out the real you
[1:12:30] now look at she gave up moses only to
[1:12:33] get him back
[1:12:37] but this time she's grateful because
[1:12:40] look
[1:12:41] because she was willing to be vulnerable
[1:12:43] with god
[1:12:44] and give up the child god later raised
[1:12:47] her child
[1:12:48] better than she could yeah
[1:12:51] instead of now maybe in one of the
[1:12:54] israelites in hebrew 10th

[1:12:58] palace

[1:13:15] wait till they killed something and then
[1:13:17] it together so they can have clothes
[1:13:19] now the clothes were coming to them in
[1:13:21] packages

[1:16:10] to as long as y'all know about clothes
[1:16:14] listen he says he says
[1:16:17] and then after a while you heard the
[1:16:18] gospel can i get amen amen
[1:16:21] maybe you went to church you picked out
[1:16:24] this and that
[1:16:25] and went from denomination to
[1:16:26] denomination but one day
[1:16:28] you being a part of god that's what this
[1:16:31] is all about right
[1:16:33] that's why you could no longer be a
[1:16:35] baptist or a methodist or a pentecostal
[1:16:38] because one day you heard the real
[1:16:40] gospel
[1:16:41] and that gospel is god and you being a
[1:16:44] part of god
[1:16:46] something begins to rise up in you
[1:16:49] what was it when you heard this message
[1:16:51] what was it it was connecting with the
[1:16:53] real you
[1:16:54] [Applause]
[1:16:57] amen that's why you and i some of you
[1:17:00] are
[1:17:00] much older but some of you are older
[1:17:04] than me honestly
[1:17:05] some of you were in the day of the
[1:17:07] problem in 1965.
[1:17:08] you know what i've never seen them i was
[1:17:11] never at the church
[1:17:13] i never even been to jeffersonville so
[1:17:15] why am i connected to this message
[1:17:18] yeah come on amen
[1:17:22] because you
[1:17:25] being a part of god
[1:17:28] you had to be a part of the word and
[1:17:31] when you heard the word
[1:17:33] you hallelujah known where you come from
[1:17:39] hallelujah i don't come from
[1:17:40] jeffersonville i don't come from south
[1:17:43] carolina i come from the mind of god
[1:17:49] so what does this message do this
[1:17:51] message brings the real you out
[1:17:53] that's why people leave because the real
[1:17:55] them won't the world
[1:18:03] [Music]
[1:18:08] you tell me where is there any fault in
[1:18:11] god
[1:18:17] amen no this he says that when you heard
[1:18:20] the word
[1:18:22] you knew where you come from you knew
[1:18:25] what was what was the truth you were
[1:18:28] always
[1:18:29] the seed was in you always the word
[1:18:32] listen what happened church
[1:18:34] when we came in contact with this
[1:18:36] message of the hour
[1:18:37] when we came in contact with the
[1:18:39] revelation for our day
[1:18:40] this is what the prophet of god said he
[1:18:42] says hallelujah the word
[1:18:44] sings the word
[1:18:50] the reason why i can follow it because i
[1:18:53] am what it
[1:18:54] is the reason why you can follow it
[1:18:58] because you are what it is you are a
[1:19:00] part of the scriptures
[1:19:04] that's why people can't follow it
[1:19:06] because they can't see themselves
[1:19:07] being a part of god that's why judas
[1:19:10] didn't go to the upper room
[1:19:12] because he could see himself with the
[1:19:14] holy ghost
[1:19:21] the word seen the word and that was in
[1:19:24] you
[1:19:25] that was before the foundation of the
[1:19:26] world saw the word and you
[1:19:29] he said then you come to it
[1:19:34] the reason why we're here because we
[1:19:36] heard what we
[1:19:37] are and we come to it this message was
[1:19:41] my magnet
[1:19:45] you know the magnet is you just walk by
[1:19:46] they go
[1:19:54] have it on the wall somewhere you just
[1:19:55] walk by just suck it in
[1:19:58] that's what happened to us church
[1:19:59] hallelujah we were minding our own
[1:20:01] business
[1:20:02] and we heard one day and next thing you
[1:20:03] know
[1:20:08] it ain't even making no sound it's just
[1:20:10] a magnetic pull
[1:20:12] hallelujah you didn't have to stream
[1:20:14] you'd have to shout it was a pull
[1:20:25] y'all keep this up somebody's gonna be

[1:20:41] plowing and the deacons came up to him
[1:20:44] and told him say john

[1:20:49] they told john john you're distracting
[1:20:51] the young people
[1:20:52] you making them think that church is
[1:20:54] emotional
[1:20:57] you're making them think that we just
[1:20:58] get happy when we come to church
[1:21:00] john we need you to stop dancing and
[1:21:02] shouting in the church
[1:21:04] john said look at here deacons listen

[1:23:00] rumor do you
[1:23:11] that's one of the biggest lies the devil
[1:23:14] ever told amen
[1:23:20] that's had an experience with god they
[1:23:21] can't help but do wrong
[1:23:24] you know sometimes i'm riding down the
[1:23:25] road in my car and i just started
[1:23:27] thinking about what god did for me
[1:23:29] and i just yeah i just had to lift my
[1:23:31] hands yeah
[1:23:39] for the grace of god as a large and
[1:23:42] worthy of
[1:23:42] all the prayers
[1:24:00] church moses was raised up
[1:24:05] in a house where he could have anything
[1:24:07] he'd ever want
[1:24:09] amen and his mama was there and brother
[1:24:11] branham said his mama would always
[1:24:13] remind him
[1:24:14] that there was something special about
[1:24:15] him while she's raising him
[1:24:18] and he's getting all the teachings of of
[1:24:19] the egyptians and all these great things
[1:24:21] to be a mighty military man
[1:24:23] and all these things she'll come to him
[1:24:24] and say son you know you don't need all
[1:24:26] that
[1:24:29] all you need to do is trust in jehovah
[1:24:34] wow remember hallelujah
[1:24:37] when moses met ramsey i believe was
[1:24:40] ramses when he came back
[1:24:41] he says who is god i'm god
[1:24:45] see they didn't even know of them they
[1:24:47] didn't even know about god
[1:24:49] but moses hallelujah is getting their
[1:24:51] teaching
[1:24:52] and his mother's teaching and her
[1:24:55] teaching
[1:24:56] one day is going to overpower everything
[1:25:00] else that they taught him in egypt
[1:25:03] why because that's who he really was he
[1:25:05] was connected with the teachings of his
[1:25:07] mom
[1:25:08] and what was that the teachings of
[1:25:10] jehovah
[1:25:18] catholic doctrine but when we came into
[1:25:20] the light of the truth
[1:25:21] the truth overpowered everything else
[1:25:23] that we known
[1:25:26] we were raised in the world and all
[1:25:27] these things but holiness hallelujah
[1:25:31] overrode everything else that we've ever
[1:25:33] known
[1:25:35] righteousness overruled everything else
[1:25:36] we've ever known
[1:25:38] what was it it was the real you coming
[1:25:41] out
[1:25:44] let's look at the scene before we close
[1:25:48] the bible says in exodus the second
[1:25:52] chapter
[1:25:57] exit is 2.
[1:26:00] x is 2 and 40. it says
[1:26:05] x is 2 and 10 i'm sorry
[1:26:09] it says in the town grew talk about
[1:26:11] moses now and the child grew and she
[1:26:13] brought him up to pharaoh's daughter
[1:26:15] and he became her son and she called his
[1:26:18] name moses
[1:26:18] and she said because i drew him out of
[1:26:20] the water and it came to pass
[1:26:23] in those days when moses was grown now
[1:26:25] he ain't a child no more
[1:26:27] right he said when moses was grown
[1:26:30] look that he went out into his brethren
[1:26:34] and looked on their burdens and he
[1:26:37] spotted an egyptian
[1:26:38] how did he know he was a brother to the
[1:26:41] slaves
[1:26:42] amen
[1:26:47] moses was grown then he went out unto
[1:26:50] his brothers
[1:26:51] and looked on their burns why was he
[1:26:53] burning
[1:26:54] for the slaves
[1:26:58] it was the real hymn coming out
[1:27:01] he couldn't be connected with the
[1:27:02] egyptians because he wasn't an egyptian
[1:27:05] even though he had no reason whatsoever
[1:27:09] to dislike an egyptian all right
[1:27:12] amen from the day of his birth
[1:27:16] the egyptians were good to him
[1:27:20] yeah amen let's go back to it
[1:27:25] he probably was eating chipotle grass
[1:27:30] fed
[1:27:33] he was eating good uh-huh
[1:27:37] he wasn't eating all this steroids
[1:27:39] pumped up no he's eating grass feed
[1:27:41] very healthy he had the best you
[1:27:44] drinking well water
[1:27:46] thinking real good he would usually
[1:27:48] probably sometimes just keep back relax
[1:27:50] and drink some real wine not just
[1:27:53] colorize stuff that people drink now to
[1:27:55] get high
[1:27:57] but he was you know moses as an egyptian
[1:28:00] he lived good so what
[1:28:03] reason did he have to ever dislike the
[1:28:06] egyptian
[1:28:07] yeah can you explain it
[1:28:12] you can't explain pharaoh's
[1:28:15] daughter had compassion on him and she
[1:28:19] raised him like her own son and you know
[1:28:22] what i love about the movie the 10
[1:28:23] commandments hallelujah
[1:28:25] when they get to the spot when moses is
[1:28:27] gone and
[1:28:28] i believe a cleopatra whoever she was
[1:28:30] she comes in
[1:28:31] and she's talking to pharaoh and he's
[1:28:33] all sad and she said there's only
[1:28:35] one name that can bring him joy it's the
[1:28:38] name of
[1:28:40] moses
[1:28:49] if you feel like that's a little early
[1:28:52] i get that out the message
[1:28:58] because the prophet said he liked that
[1:28:59] movie also
[1:29:01] he said it was the closest thing to the
[1:29:02] scripture
[1:29:04] and she said she said there's only one
[1:29:06] name that can ring in his ear there's
[1:29:08] only one name
[1:29:09] that can make him smile it's the name of
[1:29:12] moses
[1:29:18] so as far as being an egyptian
[1:29:21] he had no reason to have any hate
[1:29:23] towards them
[1:29:24] they were nothing but good church look
[1:29:27] at it he was next in line to take the
[1:29:29] throne
[1:29:31] so why wasn't he being identified he was
[1:29:34] being identified
[1:29:35] now with the real hymn
[1:29:38] [Music]
[1:29:41] the scripture says now he's grown
[1:29:44] hallelujah
[1:29:45] hallelujah he says that he look
[1:29:49] he let me back up he says most was grown
[1:29:51] then he went
[1:29:52] out until his brother and then looked
[1:29:54] looked on that bird
[1:29:56] he looked on that bird he was supposed
[1:29:59] to be over them
[1:30:00] he was supposed to be whipping them and
[1:30:02] and making them work but he got burdened
[1:30:04] because of that burden where is it
[1:30:06] coming from
[1:30:07] yeah he's connected
[1:30:11] wow he's connected when they heard he
[1:30:14] hurt hallelujah
[1:30:18] where's that coming from that's not an
[1:30:20] egyptian cycle coming out of him
[1:30:22] right he's he's being reminded
[1:30:25] hallelujah
[1:30:26] on the inside of his birthplace he's
[1:30:28] coming out of his spiritual amnesia
[1:30:41] pharaoh he didn't know pharaoh's
[1:30:44] uh daughter didn't know how nobody knew
[1:30:47] moses now
[1:30:49] on the inside he got a war going on
[1:30:52] because he's been raised as an egyptian
[1:30:54] but he didn't fell in love with the
[1:30:55] slaves
[1:30:58] amen well what is it it's the life of
[1:31:01] the seed
[1:31:04] okay now let's flip over to hebrews 11.
[1:31:10] let me finish that let me finish that
[1:31:12] scripture right there give me the next
[1:31:13] part brother to that scripture
[1:31:15] it says that he looked this way in that
[1:31:17] way and when he saw that there was
[1:31:19] no man he flew an egyptian and hit him
[1:31:22] in the sand
[1:31:24] how could moses have so much hate
[1:31:26] towards the people that raised him
[1:31:28] throws the people that did nothing but
[1:31:30] good for him yeah
[1:31:33] he's going the complete opposite
[1:31:36] hebrews 11.
[1:31:42] see when the real you begins to come
[1:31:44] forward nothing can stop
[1:31:45] it
[1:31:47] [Music]
[1:31:48] it doesn't matter where you come from it
[1:31:51] doesn't matter where you are now
[1:31:53] it doesn't matter how somebody treated
[1:31:54] you when the real you start to come
[1:31:56] forth
[1:31:57] it will connect with your purpose
[1:32:01] it will connect with your destiny it
[1:32:04] will connect with what god
[1:32:05] saw hallelujah before the foundation of
[1:32:07] the world glory
[1:32:09] amen listen hebrews 11
[1:32:12] and 23 it says by faith moses when he
[1:32:15] was born
[1:32:16] he was here three months of the parents
[1:32:18] because they saw
[1:32:20] he was a proper child and they were not
[1:32:22] afraid of the king's commandments by
[1:32:24] faith
[1:32:24] moses when he was come to years refused
[1:32:28] to be called the son of pharaoh's
[1:32:29] daughter
[1:32:30] why when she did nothing but good
[1:32:35] sure right think about that parents you
[1:32:38] didn't raise your child
[1:32:39] you gave them everything you can have
[1:32:41] and now that child turns around and
[1:32:43] walks away from you
[1:32:45] wouldn't that hurt you moses did that
[1:32:50] what was it the real him was coming out
[1:32:54] he was connecting hallelujah with his
[1:32:56] predestination
[1:33:04] you see the power of the seed yes amen
[1:33:07] are you with me church you see the power
[1:33:08] of what god put inside of you
[1:33:10] honey you may was in the bar you may was
[1:33:12] in the club
[1:33:13] you may was living a ratchet life but
[1:33:16] when that seed connected with his
[1:33:18] purpose
[1:33:18] the bar couldn't stop it the internet
[1:33:21] couldn't stop
[1:33:22] it pornography can't stop it depression
[1:33:24] can't stop it
[1:33:25] cancer can't stop it aids can't stop it
[1:33:28] the pandemic won't stop it
[1:33:34] amen
[1:33:46] listen he says he refused to be called
[1:33:49] the son of pharaoh's daughter
[1:33:51] choosing rather to suffer affliction why
[1:33:54] would this man want to choose to suffer
[1:33:56] we didn't have to yeah
[1:34:01] he had everything of egypt at his
[1:34:03] fingertips
[1:34:06] he's turning down that life you know
[1:34:09] what that sounds you know what that
[1:34:10] sounds like
[1:34:12] sounds like brian material to me
[1:34:15] some of us have had this world at our
[1:34:17] fingertips good
[1:34:18] jobs and all these good things that the
[1:34:21] world has to offer
[1:34:22] but we choose rather to suffer
[1:34:24] affliction
[1:34:25] amen with the people of god then you
[1:34:29] enjoy
[1:34:30] the pleasures of sin forces
[1:34:33] and look what moses did moses went and
[1:34:35] grabbed that egyptian
[1:34:37] popped his neck buried him in the sand
[1:34:39] and ran for his life
[1:34:40] what was happening he was awakening
[1:34:46] he's on the run but now he's awakened
[1:34:49] right he's no longer in the palace
[1:34:52] trying to be
[1:34:52] something he's not right
[1:34:56] but now he's on the run i wonder how
[1:34:58] many of us they got tired of the palace
[1:35:01] we rather go out here and rough it
[1:35:04] to see god moving our lives
[1:35:08] moses he left all that
[1:35:12] he went on the run but look
[1:35:15] all that stuff he felt what was
[1:35:16] happening the real hymn was coming out
[1:35:19] amen because of that pressure of killing
[1:35:21] the egyptian
[1:35:22] running on his life he met his wife
[1:35:25] [Music]
[1:35:26] hallelujah amen and all of this was a
[1:35:29] process
[1:35:30] to wake up the real moses you know moses
[1:35:33] hallelujah
[1:35:34] he had a temple he popped a man net for
[1:35:36] no reason
[1:35:37] so he met a woman whose temple was just
[1:35:39] as worse than he is
[1:35:42] god know what he's doing god led him
[1:35:45] right to a woman
[1:35:46] that can calm him down so god can use
[1:35:50] him
[1:35:53] see he's getting awakened all over again
[1:35:57] then he isolated and put him on the back
[1:35:58] side of the desert so god can talk to
[1:36:01] him
[1:36:01] put him alone hallelujah so god could
[1:36:04] talk to him
[1:36:04] and made him hallelujah made him
[1:36:07] sensitive to the spirit
[1:36:08] so he could hear a voice coming out of a
[1:36:10] bush glory
[1:36:12] amen amen he would have never heard that
[1:36:15] in egypt
[1:36:17] amen but now god
[1:36:20] put him in a atmosphere
[1:36:23] he wouldn't question my head
[1:36:27] no did you notice he didn't walk up to
[1:36:29] the bus and say what is this
[1:36:31] ain't no bush supposed to be speaking
[1:36:33] ain't no bush supposed to be on fire not
[1:36:35] consumed
[1:36:37] but this place moses in now he was able
[1:36:41] to experience the supernatural
[1:36:43] and become one with it
[1:36:50] and now he goes back to godhood god
[1:36:53] comes down
[1:36:54] god hears the cry of his people he comes
[1:36:56] to moses moses
[1:36:57] i've chose you to be this first thing
[1:37:00] moses said lord
[1:37:01] i can't talk you see what that woman did
[1:37:03] to him
[1:37:08] she calmed him all the way down
[1:37:11] he was the egyptian you tell me shut up
[1:37:13] sit down
[1:37:14] i'm the king i have to shout do what i
[1:37:17] say
[1:37:18] a couple years with his apartment he was
[1:37:20] done
[1:37:21] oh going to god lord i can't die
[1:37:32] she worked on them in such a way that
[1:37:35] the testimony of moses the bible says
[1:37:37] there'll never be a man more meekly
[1:37:46] moses
[1:37:50] you may say what am i going why am i
[1:37:52] going through this maybe god is trying
[1:37:54] to calm you down
[1:37:55] come on maybe he's trying to pull some
[1:37:57] things out of you
[1:37:59] that's been buried inside but he want to
[1:38:01] get to the real you
[1:38:03] look church god can call you he can
[1:38:05] choose you knowing that there are
[1:38:07] mistakes to be
[1:38:08] made inside of you right
[1:38:13] i'm running out of time think about it
[1:38:16] church
[1:38:16] god chose david knowing he was going to
[1:38:19] commit adultery
[1:38:21] knowing he was going to pre-meditate
[1:38:22] murder knowing he was going to try to be
[1:38:25] sneaky and get out of it
[1:38:27] and listen that god's testimony about
[1:38:29] david he's a man after my very own heart
[1:38:35] he was a man of god's very own heart
[1:38:38] with those
[1:38:39] things inside of him but wasn't gonna do
[1:38:41] god
[1:38:42] let him fall so he can wake him up
[1:38:47] and you notice once david failed he was
[1:38:50] so angry
[1:38:51] when nothing came to him you told the
[1:38:53] man had 500 wives
[1:38:57] why do you have to have one more right
[1:39:01] god was going to use that experience to
[1:39:02] bring out the real david
[1:39:04] why i love reading about david
[1:39:08] one of my one of my favorite characters
[1:39:09] in the scripture that's my brother
[1:39:11] hallelujah
[1:39:12] because david doesn't present a life of
[1:39:16] all glory and triumph
[1:39:19] and no growth
[1:39:23] every victory david had he worked for
[1:39:26] him
[1:39:28] natural and spiritual he worked for it
[1:39:32] listen church david go seek bathsheba
[1:39:34] hallelujah
[1:39:35] you know what when nathan came to him
[1:39:37] and told my david david they say
[1:39:38] she knew i was up there i'd go there
[1:39:40] every day the same time
[1:39:42] every hour she did that on purpose why
[1:39:45] didn't she do like
[1:39:46] why didn't he do like saul he was the
[1:39:47] people
[1:39:51] because the real david was coming out
[1:39:53] just like saul
[1:39:54] a real saul was coming out a man that
[1:39:56] couldn't obey god
[1:39:58] amen but look at david and his point
[1:40:01] listen i want you to realize
[1:40:02] these moments are moments when we meet
[1:40:05] god
[1:40:05] yes this was david's moment to meet god
[1:40:10] and listen what he did hallelujah once
[1:40:12] nathan showed him all the stuff he did
[1:40:14] david was so mad david said i'm gonna
[1:40:16] kill him where is that i'm gonna kill
[1:40:18] him
[1:40:20] ain't never going back to his church
[1:40:24] he must be surprising that what we do
[1:40:28] and then said david
[1:40:32] that man issue why didn't they
[1:40:35] say but i'm the king he didn't do that
[1:40:40] the scripture said david repented right
[1:40:43] see that was the real david
[1:40:47] even though he was a king he had a heart
[1:40:50] to make things right with god that's why
[1:40:52] god chose him
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:58] and as i'm coming down look the real you
[1:41:03] should do like david did when you're
[1:41:05] caught up
[1:41:06] amen look at what he did he repented
[1:41:11] and from there he received the twins in
[1:41:13] his life
[1:41:14] grace and mercy and from that point
[1:41:18] church
[1:41:19] you never heard about david doing
[1:41:22] anything like that again
[1:41:27] because when you truly repent hallelujah
[1:41:30] that spirit leaves your life
[1:41:33] that's why people are going around in
[1:41:35] circles because they haven't repented
[1:41:37] once you repent give it to god
[1:41:40] it be gone amen
[1:41:48] why he chose not to to be identified and
[1:41:50] choose to suffer affliction and all
[1:41:52] these things
[1:41:53] when you meet your awakening what is it
[1:41:55] is you meeting god
[1:41:57] the real you coming out you look at god
[1:42:00] or let you
[1:42:00] look like you're on a pathway or right
[1:42:02] and you're really on the pathway of
[1:42:03] wrong
[1:42:04] remember saul saul was going out there
[1:42:06] persecuting the church
[1:42:07] he thought he was right and what
[1:42:08] happened he met god amen
[1:42:10] and when he met god the real paul came
[1:42:13] out
[1:42:14] changed his name from saul to paul it
[1:42:17] goes like that in all the scriptures i
[1:42:18] mean you take jacob
[1:42:19] jacob was tricking people he was tricked
[1:42:21] his daddy tricked his brothers
[1:42:23] had his mama a part of his father went
[1:42:25] down to treat his father-in-law
[1:42:28] with the cows and all these things he
[1:42:30] trick trick trick
[1:42:31] trick but now he's getting to a place
[1:42:35] where god want to wake him up huddle
[1:42:37] god want to show him who he really is he
[1:42:39] went down there he got four women
[1:42:41] fighting over him
[1:42:43] i want his baby i don't want his baby no
[1:42:44] i want his baby no i'm having a baby
[1:42:50] y'all know that right he had four
[1:42:51] different women
[1:42:54] see these spirits these spirits ain't uh
[1:42:56] ain't uh nothing new
[1:42:59] man we're folding from baby mamas
[1:43:06] every seed starts in genesis right
[1:43:09] that's right
[1:43:12] but now he got to a place to where he
[1:43:15] couldn't
[1:43:16] he couldn't trick his way out of normal
[1:43:18] he got to go back
[1:43:20] because he upset his father-in-law he's
[1:43:21] leaving boy leaving esau coming
[1:43:24] holly and that trial holly forced him to
[1:43:27] do what
[1:43:27] fallen on his knees and the real jacob
[1:43:31] came
[1:43:31] out a man that would fight
[1:43:35] for god's presence a man that would
[1:43:38] fight
[1:43:38] her to be blessed by god he said lord i
[1:43:41] ain't gonna turn you loose
[1:43:42] until you bless me and when god blessed
[1:43:46] him
[1:43:46] god changed his walk wow not on his walk
[1:43:49] but god changed his name
[1:43:52] amen changed his whole identity
[1:43:56] then the real him came out he was no
[1:43:58] longer a shy stuff
[1:43:59] but now he's a prince
[1:44:03] come on music let me close
[1:44:08] church we may look around and

[1:45:45] little bit more
[1:45:46] don't get caught up with these different
[1:45:48] laws that given out with the pandemic
[1:45:50] it's molding people into a certain
[1:45:56] character
[1:45:58] one of my friends told me that they was
[1:45:59] voting to have to come back to church
[1:46:01] because
[1:46:01] they were letting them come back to
[1:46:02] church and all these things and and
[1:46:04] they got to voting should they come back
[1:46:06] to church so they stay streaming they
[1:46:08] voted to stay streaming
[1:46:10] lord have mercy in the day where the
[1:46:13] bible says as we see that time
[1:46:15] approaching we ought to fellowship them
[1:46:17] all
[1:46:18] right right people feeling like they
[1:46:21] want to stay home that ain't scripture
[1:46:24] so where is that coming from where is it
[1:46:26] coming from
[1:46:27] if you have a desire to stay home where
[1:46:29] is it coming from it
[1:46:31] ain't god that's right amen god said he
[1:46:34] want us together he wants us to gather
[1:46:37] he wants to pull off each other
[1:46:40] and just because we can't stay home
[1:46:42] we're staying home
[1:46:43] church we we're not in the days of the
[1:46:46] law
[1:46:47] this is mercy come to church and
[1:46:50] experience god's
[1:46:53] yeah mercy laws say you can stay home
[1:46:55] but we're not living under the law
[1:47:00] i take my chances with god's mercy
[1:47:03] [Music]
[1:47:06] glory if he healed me before he can heal
[1:47:08] me again
[1:47:11] and you know what let's make a
[1:47:12] declaration in this church harley
[1:47:15] you can't die i can't die i can't get
[1:47:18] sick you can't get sick
[1:47:19] unless god allows it
[1:47:24] look here you can't get nothing unless
[1:47:27] you chose it
[1:47:33] you got to be chosen by god
[1:47:36] that anything happened to you because
[1:47:38] remember the devil was going to and fro
[1:47:40] trying to get to somebody
[1:47:41] and god said amen
[1:47:45] he got a hedge around him don't even
[1:47:48] think about it
[1:47:49] see you got to be chosen
[1:47:53] and some of you don't even realize it
[1:47:55] god will choose you just to shut the
[1:47:57] devil up
[1:47:59] amen hallelujah
[1:48:02] church espresso it's time for the real
[1:48:05] you to come out

[1:48:14] president get four more years
[1:48:17] [Music]
[1:48:30] right here man this is my own personal
[1:48:33] opinion
[1:48:34] when i hear a man say those people those
[1:48:37] ku klux klan they're
[1:48:38] good people
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:48] i don't know about that one but
[1:48:51] there's all kind of things that's gonna
[1:48:56] rise you out to show who you really are
[1:48:59] and we're gonna be looking at you like
[1:49:00] what
[1:49:01] really that's who they are but i ain't
[1:49:04] gonna stop i'm gonna keep on pressing
[1:49:07] you do you do according to however
[1:49:09] you're being led but i want to be led by
[1:49:12] god
[1:49:14] i want to find myself i don't want to be
[1:49:16] one of those ones
[1:49:17] who bury what god gave me but know if he
[1:49:19] gave me two
[1:49:20] i want to bring back two more he gave me
[1:49:23] one i want to bring back one more
[1:49:25] hallelujah
[1:49:26] but he gave me five there's an ability
[1:49:29] in me
[1:49:29] to bring back five whatever god gave you
[1:49:33] you're supposed to bring back interest
[1:49:35] off that
[1:49:36] amen amen let's pray
[1:49:40] keep playing lord jesus follow me thank
[1:49:43] you for your word we pray with something
[1:49:44] sad to help your people
[1:49:47] lord and we don't want it to seem like
[1:49:49] we're fussing
[1:49:51] but lord if we can just look at how you
[1:49:52] allow certain things to happen lord
[1:49:55] it is only to strip off our spiritual
[1:49:57] amnesia
[1:49:58] like moses lord he had no reason to feel
[1:50:01] the way he felt
[1:50:05] to the egyptians because they were good
[1:50:06] to him what was it was the seed inside
[1:50:09] coming to life
[1:50:11] and he couldn't see himself being
[1:50:13] identified with that when he was a
[1:50:15] hebrew
[1:50:17] lord and the real him began to come out
[1:50:19] and begin to
[1:50:20] be identified with the affliction and
[1:50:23] persecution
[1:50:24] and all those things why because you
[1:50:26] made him a deliverer
[1:50:28] so for there to be deliverance they have
[1:50:30] to be bondage
[1:50:32] and moses saw the bondage which which
[1:50:34] brought forth the real hymn
[1:50:36] deliverance lord we thank you for this
[1:50:39] church
[1:50:40] thank you for the pastor lord the people
[1:50:42] the atmosphere
[1:50:44] lord we pray that you just continue to
[1:50:46] move in our lives like only you could
[1:50:48] in jesus christ's name we pray thank you
[1:50:51] the church amen

[1:51:28] put my life in his head
[1:51:34] yes lord i put my life
[1:51:38] in his head
[1:51:42] so every road i walk down
[1:51:46] i'm sure it's in his plan
[1:51:52] i put my life in his
[1:51:56] hand sing it again now my father knows
[1:52:00] my father knows what i
[1:52:04] need yes you do lord
[1:52:08] my father knows what i need and
[1:52:15] everything i go through

[1:52:29] control
[1:52:31] oh he's got it all
[1:52:35] in control yes lord
[1:52:40] he's got it all in control
[1:52:47] he put that reassurance
[1:52:51] way down in my soul
[1:52:56] [Music]
[1:52:57] he's got it all
[1:53:01] in control
[1:53:02] [Music]
[1:53:05] amen do you appreciate the word tonight
[1:53:07] my i
[1:53:08] certainly did bro diggs i was just right
[1:53:10] with you the whole time so good amen
[1:53:12] that's just
[1:53:13] exactly i'll just testify thank you lord
[1:53:16] that's exactly what i needed to hear
[1:53:18] tonight
[1:53:19] amen appreciate brother diggs for
[1:53:20] surrendering he always does
[1:53:22] just uh and brother diggs always it just
[1:53:25] and my memory it's just every time we
[1:53:27] have brother diggs it's always there's
[1:53:29] something that's said
[1:53:30] that it's just such a confirmation that
[1:53:32] was from the holy spirit for me
[1:53:34] amen so i certainly appreciate that i
[1:53:37] thought of
[1:53:38] so many examples um that that
[1:53:41] that brother diggs used and then your
[1:53:43] mind just starts going the real you
[1:53:46] you know brother digs i thought about
[1:53:47] one man in the bible and i've i've
[1:53:49] shared this before
[1:53:50] who the bible uh tells a story in mark i
[1:53:53] think it's chapter five
[1:53:55] where a man named legion remember that
[1:53:58] story
[1:53:59] and and i i think it's amazing because i
[1:54:02] i just was hearing brother dick's
[1:54:03] preached tonight and i thought you know
[1:54:05] you look at moses you look at jacob you
[1:54:07] look at david look at all these examples
[1:54:09] he gave there's always an example of
[1:54:12] who you really are and who you really
[1:54:14] aren't
[1:54:16] and you know and sometimes it's amazing
[1:54:17] because we can see
[1:54:19] you know whether it's a loved one a
[1:54:21] family member
[1:54:22] a child maybe even our own selves and we
[1:54:25] can go down paths in our own life and
[1:54:26] sometimes we got to remind ourselves
[1:54:28] this ain't really me
[1:54:30] amen you get you get tripped up in
[1:54:32] something something you shouldn't be in
[1:54:33] the lord just reminds you hey that's not
[1:54:34] who you are
[1:54:36] i thought about legion because you know
[1:54:38] the bible talks about
[1:54:39] how that jesus goes on the other side
[1:54:41] and there comes a man
[1:54:42] and if you if you read mark chapter 5
[1:54:45] when jesus
[1:54:46] speaks to him and he says what what is
[1:54:48] thou to do with us
[1:54:50] you know that wasn't the man and the
[1:54:52] holy spirit told me i was reading mark
[1:54:53] five one time
[1:54:54] and i and i preached this and i said you
[1:54:56] know a lot of times you take a loved one
[1:54:59] who's maybe addicted to some drugs or
[1:55:01] maybe has some addiction in their life
[1:55:03] you take some situation
[1:55:04] and you got to be so careful that you
[1:55:07] don't confuse the spirit
[1:55:09] with that person and you gotta never get
[1:55:12] that mixed up because if you go read
[1:55:14] that story of legion
[1:55:16] he says what is your name and then this
[1:55:19] not the man
[1:55:20] but the spirit speaks and says my name
[1:55:22] is legion which legion just meant a
[1:55:25] roman army was meant a vast uh meant a
[1:55:28] lot of people two or three thousand
[1:55:29] people
[1:55:31] and so jesus says what is there what is
[1:55:33] your name and he says my name is legion
[1:55:35] that's that wasn't his name
[1:55:36] that wasn't the real him the real him
[1:55:39] was not an alcoholic
[1:55:41] it wasn't a he wasn't addicted to drugs
[1:55:43] he wasn't a man in the tomb
[1:55:44] that was a if you go read and brother
[1:55:46] brandon picks up the story he's a
[1:55:47] husband
[1:55:48] he had a wife at home had children at
[1:55:49] home and
[1:55:51] he was a father that was the real him he
[1:55:53] was a real son of god it wasn't the
[1:55:55] spirit
[1:55:56] and don't ever let no matter what
[1:55:58] situation you go through this is what
[1:56:00] spoke to me brother dave
[1:56:01] no matter what you see in your family
[1:56:03] your loved one
[1:56:05] don't ever let the devil tell you that
[1:56:07] that's them that's not
[1:56:08] them that's the spirit they're under and
[1:56:11] you say lord
[1:56:12] let the real film that seed of god
[1:56:14] that's down inside of them
[1:56:16] amen let them surrender to that when
[1:56:17] legion was free the bible says he
[1:56:20] comes back to himself he comes back into
[1:56:23] uh comes back to his family and there's
[1:56:25] his mother and and he says that all the
[1:56:27] children and mother gets scared and he
[1:56:28] says no no
[1:56:29] and and brother traumatized he says
[1:56:31] daddy's different now
[1:56:34] and brother adam said see what made the
[1:56:35] difference he had been with jesus
[1:56:38] and brother branham said you take any
[1:56:39] daddy any mommy any son he said let him
[1:56:41] get with
[1:56:42] jesus amen the real you will come out
[1:56:46] amen praise the lord thank you brother
[1:56:47] diggs for that we have some prayer
[1:56:49] requests we want a
