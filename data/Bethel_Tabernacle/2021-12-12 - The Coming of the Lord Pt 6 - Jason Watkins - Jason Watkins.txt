god we're going to invite you right back to your feet sorry about that but we want to turn right into the scripture amen and um uh we're going a little bit in a time confinement today so i i have a certain place that i want by all means to get to and we'll just have to trust the lord for it amen amen praise the lord so we're going to invite you to first thessalonians 4 and you could be turning there straight away i had one request come in from sister phyllis did that get prayed over yet okay we'll we'll cover that amen praise the lord we'll cover that just as we um go to our scripture now i sure want to just thank everyone for the smashing success of yesterday it was just such a wonderful wonderful time amen our thanks again to brother mike and sister wanda for hosting that for us and so uh i thought it it it it met and exceeded all my expectations so i was really glad glad to see such a nice crowd out and everybody that got to be a partaker of it praise the lord it's wonderful to be a part of the family of god well jack good to see you how sister kathy this morning okay so amen devil is fighting her right he ain't nobody he just okay all right very good very good praise the lord so um we want to pray and let the lord continue to touch our sister bring her completely to full strength and uh sister phyllis um uh sent and i thought that i had it right there oh yeah here we go um prayer request for my youngest sister jackie she was uh this is from sister phyllis this is her sister she was in an uh car accident and or in an accident is it an automobile accident sister yeah and uh my having major surgery on both legs today she has an ongoing drug addiction problem and i've been praying for her life for her life to change and believe this situation has to has to do with that although the circumstances are very bad you know it's interesting how that the bible's a lot of times people um are misunderstanding that all things you know are supposed to be good but actually the bible doesn't prophesy that it says all things work together for your good so a lot of times things happen to us you go where's the good in that well just hang on wait for the rest of it to come together amen you don't eat the individual ingredients of a cake till it's put together and baked and then it's delicious but you wouldn't like it eating just the individual ingredients but let's just pray for this need and she says although the circumstance is very bad she has a broken kneecap on her left leg and broken bones on her right lower leg amen uh pray for her all around healing amen do you know it's the exact same healing that heals the body heals the soul amen it's the same word uh divine healing whether it's in the soul the spirit the mind the flesh the bible says that the word of god is health to all your flesh everything that makes up you is healable by the word of god amen praise the lord so many um participated so we won't want to take that request to the lord this morning but i just want to say one last time how thrilled i was with yesterday so many people made that possible so many brothers and sisters working behind the scene my goodness and today we have a a little bit of a special service we've got a um a production that our youth are going to put on for us and um okay that's fine the offering basket will be in the back as you go out they didn't get time we've been pre so pressed for time this morning uh but it'll be in the back uh for you as you as you go out um we've got a production today and got all these actors up here praise the lord amen praise the lord so they're going to be little preachers today amen and so we're happy for that we want to give some time for that but i think that we want to get the most important part which is the preached word from from a minister standing in the pulpit there's nothing the lord doesn't replace that with anything all the way until the body change amen it's live five-fold ministry preaching uh until the body change now that's the scripture some people have decided that they'll just stay home and play tapes that's fine but that's not the scripture for the complete picture and so the completed picture is that we do all of the above we read our bible we we pray we listen to the tapes we come to church we have fellowship we participate i got you you got me amen we need one another i need you you need me don't deny me you come on i need you i won't deny you me see i'll work hard and be sincere before the lord and we will we will come together but it was it was such a multi-effort for yesterday and today if i start naming names we'll we'll sure leave somebody out but let's go to the lord in prayer just now brother andrew just give me a court of only believe as we pray amen father how we thank you lord for this wonderful privilege to come into your house to be your manifestated manifested bride in the earth today lord we're we're it it where it leaves us dumbfounded at times how that we could have been lord with such a position and it's all your grace and your mercy lord father that that word of god is a sharp two-edged sword but lord we know according to the bible that that as that sword swings yes lord there is a law to it but there's a grace to it lord and we realize that father even under moses came the law but under elijah came grace lord and father under christ which is the elijah for this day we're swinging that sword today father and it's to cut down the enemy father to your to your to the enemy it's death it's a death blow but to your to your family when we swing the sword back and forth back and forth it's crying mercy grace mercy grace mercy grace lord we're thankful for that today i pray now that you will let it come to us in such a way heal our sick and afflicted lord we have this request from sister phyllis lord we're believing you for that request right now believing that you will grant this lord just as it's been asked of thee lord may there become great healing all the way down in her soul to to lord fix her life you're the only one who can fix broken lives lord i pray uh for sister kathy that you will continue to strengthen her lord by the power of your might and all the saints of god we commit it to you today in jesus name bless your word now both speaker and hearer bless our little preachers that'll come after after me lord and i pray all this whole day and the balance of it will be under your leadership and your approval in jesus name amen amen god bless you friends we're going to look at first thessalonians 4 and we want to just read 13-18 we'll let you be seated but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord i'm preaching today on the coming of the lord part 6 that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are sleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord i love this 18th verse wherefore comfort one another with these words amen praise the lord that's that's comforting what we just read may god bless his word you can be seated so i i want to ask you to uh please have your attention very quickly at hand here and and others are coming in the musicians are transitioning but they'll get to hear because we've got sound all through um our neighbors get to hear singing and preaching amen and we've had a number of times where we called him standing outside listening so i just say blessed be the name of the lord amen amen you know you say um are you sure you sure we should do that yeah we should probably turn it up amen make it even louder so amen i appreciate the lord but we want to move right straight into to this segment today of the coming of the lord that i want to speak to you on my heart there be another portion yet we'll get to it as the lord allows but we're going to get at least try to get to a certain spot this morning so now you've you've all you're all very familiar with mechanics and dynamics and of course brother branham talks about that the mechanics are the word that are that you're storing up in your heart you're coming here today and you're storing mechanics and and there's coming a an outpouring of the dynamics which is not just something to say well somewhere over rainbow it's coming those dynamics are already happening now but what when we say mechanics become dynamics we're meaning that time when the trumpet of god shall sound and the dead in christ shall rise and and and that's what i'm particularly referencing right at this moment so don't don't you don't want to look down the road and say somewhere over a rainbow uh i'll finally get the holy spirit moving in my life you need to have him moving in your life now and we realize that i want to expand now your thoughts on mechanics and dynamics and now it's an important part to understand that it's it's it's not exactly the full picture if you're looking at it to say well right now it's mechanics but someday it'll be dynamics uh and then but then brother jason you've confused me because you're you're talking about how that it's already transitioning so the best way to understand it is the way brother branham described it mechanics become dynamics so it transitions just like brother branham said you take gasoline and you put fire to it now the gasoline is the mechanics see just like the word the fire you're holding in your hand is the dynamics that's the holy ghost now when you put this fire onto that gasoline the you don't somehow over here get a second episode where now you've got you know mechanics burning as soon as this dynamics touches mechanics mechanics become dynamics the whole thing becomes fire so it is transitioning but again we're focusing right at this moment on the completion on the fullness of adoption which is the change of our bodies now i want to expand your thinking just a little bit on mechanics because the bride is not the only one storing mechanics the bride is not the only one the antichrist has got mechanics and the antichrist is actually being set in order for his dynamics amen and we realize that when his dynamics come that it will be the antichrist mechanics will become dynamics in an incarnation of a man that the antichrist spirit will become a man satan will indwell uh where there's a demon as as a placeholder in the false prophet presently right now he has many demons that are placeholders waiting for lucifer himself when the bride goes up lucifer's kicked out and he comes down and he and he runs out the demons who are place holding and he fills that spot and then the the false prophet becomes the beast personified as a human you understand so so we're looking then that that you know and this is how that you know the antichrist system even through politics and through ecumenical movements remember that the power of the antichrist is trifold it is political power religious power and demon power all right and so you realize that satan the antichrist system has been working in the church for millennia but he's coming to a time and it's very near it now where he's going to take the full reigns the only thing holding him back is you see but we realize that he works through politics he works through pulpits he works through you know he even even if you look at unions and i'm not here to preach for against unions i'm neither republican or democrat i'm a christian but but you realize that that a lot of times the unions allow him to very quickly make a maneuver pull a little string and suddenly millions of people line up to a direction and i'm not saying they're good or bad i'm not i'm not talking about that i'm talking about it's something like pulpits that satan uses not saying pulpits are bad or people who are bad or preaching false doctrine i'm saying the enemy has control of something amen and can use that something you know that that's what elon musk right now is arguing against you know the president's plan for you know to give you incentives government incentives if you change to electric vehicle and but the catch is that he'll give 12 500 if if the vehicle you buy was built by a union worker in the united states and if it was built by a non-union worker they only you only get half the credit and so musk is saying hey that's not fair and it's not fair but that's that's politics you understand and so you don't want to be unaware of of satan's politics we're not up here to con to preach conspiracy theory i'm not preaching theory and preaching prophecy and there's plenty of conspiracy to go around and i don't i don't i don't like the the wild side of that it gets on my nerves really and i'll quickly walk away from someone who gets on a roll with that but i but i'm also not unaware of the satan's devices and you need to be aware that this ain't no this isn't this isn't cub scouts this is real time this is the antichrist taking over the world in real time in the exact same way that the elect lady is getting all of her mechanics set up uh for the dynamics which brother branham said will be a refilling of the holy ghost to do what to quicken the word that you're storing in your heart right now as you're believing this word this is why you hear brother jason say god is doing more in you than you're aware as you are storing up the word i promise you you're giving more uh you're giving more food you're giving more power you're giving more mechanics for the holy ghost to anoint in your life not in a tribulation not when the saints come back but right now in your life in real time it is to quicken the word that we've held in our hearts by faith and so you know we we think about you know what is your expectation what is your expectation as we near uh the body change you know and i and i and i want to try to answer that for you today and let you know that the only thing we are given to expect is the promised word what god has promised and so so then because that's true if you don't have faith in the word of this end time hour then how would you expect anything you know uh uh as far as the bride leaving here how would that be part of your expectation if you don't have a full faith in the word sent to help you leave here to give you a body change i i think you're seeing my point there's no way if if the devil is able to to weaken your faith in the message of this hour which was sent for the express purpose to restore the faith see the faith of the early apostles which they had enough faith to go in a rapture but the church backslid now we've come back we've had a message restored and i'm here to tell you it's our lives picking up where they crested over and began to decline we take it on to the body change but it is that if the if the if the holy ghost anointing the mechanics is what brings your body change how do you expect a body change if your faith is not in the mechanics if you're questioning the mechanics if you think it's a it's an outdated message if you think it was just a man he's just a prophet he's full of mistakes and a lot of it's just his opinion i'm here to tell you i'm nervous for you when it comes body change time i'm here to say lord you sent me thus saith the lord it's not about me trying to figure out who's right i'm not here to qualify a prophet i'm here to accept thus saith the lord and then you promised that you would anoint that word that i'm believing in my heart see so the lesson then in this question the lesson to be learned is that your faith had better be in the rapturing word that was promised for this day see the mechanics for the gentiles and for israel are being set in order israel is fully a nation they have their own borders they have their own money they have their own flag the six point star of david their full nation recognizing and that was not true for thousands of years but it only came to pass in the late 20th century and so we realized then that you have the antichrist system with her mechanics you have the gentile church that will be left behind with their mechanics the ecumenical movement you have israel with their mechanics and the bride has got her mechanics set up you believe it church nominal has mechanics the antichrist system has mechanics and they're all we're we're all waiting for our dynamics you understand that so you understand they say well we're here getting ready for something so is everybody else that's right they have a misunderstanding in their expectation their expectation is that when the rapture comes the nominal church has an expectation they'll go in the rapture and i'm not and i'm and my message to them is you're you're going to miss it but not because you're bad people you're going to miss it because you haven't received the rapturing word which would give you rapturing faith see and so so we realized that then this is why the unwise virgin this is why she is unwise because she refuses the message that was brought to give her the faith for a body change and so when the appointed hour arrives which i'm going to tell you something friends is going to be a morning just like any other morning and things are going to happen very quickly i want you to be aware of that today young people you'll see it in your lifetime on that morning when the dead in christ rise things globally are going to happen very quickly mechanics will transition rapidly into full dynamics of the holy ghost and it will manifest all the seed of all the groups that are holding seed in their heart holding of faith whether their their faith is in science that'll have a dynamic whether their faith is in an ecumenical denominational system that'll have a dynamic you see that'll have a result that'll grow a crop that'll come to fruition remember that when they sowed they they sowed tares among the wheat and jesus they said jesus shall we take them pull them up no he says let them grow together and at the harvest now watch the first thing that happens you say oh can you just get to the part where the grain is taken to the garner we're going to get there but do you know what happens ahead of that the tares have to first be bound together for the burning then we go in the rapture and that scripture is happening right now i'm here to tell you dynamics are already binding them together and setting a platform for satan to to enter to tabernacle inside a false prophet and become a beast system and take the world into destruction while a bride is seated at a table thousands of miles long this is reality friends this isn't a story this is actually not something that's going to happen it's happening right now it's already underway see and so there it's going to transition very rapidly we can look at a few places in the scripture proverbs 6 14 to 16. watch watch how solomon uh treats the forward person which is a person with a perverted heart all right so frowardness in his heart speaking of a man with frowitness in his heart he deviseth mischief continually he soweth discord therefore catch it shall his calamity come suddenly suddenly shall he be broken without remedy the sixth so these six things doth the lord hey yeah seven aren't abomination in him so so we're we're finding that that there's a thing that's coming where when it happens it's going to move rapidly i you know they don't have it back there i didn't tell them but let me just read that same passage from the nlt their perverted hearts plot evil and they constantly stir up trouble but they will be destroyed suddenly broken in an instant beyond all hope of healing that's the person who has perverted evil in their heart when because the the perverted evil is the mechanics they're building up perversion and evil in their hearts because why they've trusted in the arm of flesh they've trusted in science they've trusted in man-made religion they've trusted in politics they maybe maybe they they've trusted in some energy something they don't even know what it is but i'm here to tell you i have trusted in the revealed word of this hour and when this happens and it moves quickly we're going to leave quickly they're going to transition quickly satan's going to move rapidly and the whole world is going to descend and go from existence that has lasted 6 000 years to being snuffed out in 42 months that's a rapid decline isaiah 47 look at it again 47 7-11 man i got to hurry and thou i will be a lady forever so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart neither disremember the latter end of it in other words this is a this is a people who didn't take the prophets seriously they didn't believe don't read ahead of me they didn't believe the message that the prophet brought them and they didn't think they needed it and their their testimony was you said i'll be a lady forever so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart neither disremember the latter end of it therefore now hear this you who rejected it watch now hear uh now therefore hear now this thou that art given to pleasures that dwell us carelessly thou sayest in thine heart i am and none else beside me see you're your own you're your own boss i shall i shall not sit as a widow neither shall i know the loss of children but these two things shall come upon thee in a moment in one day the loss of children and widowhood they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries and for the great abundance of thine enchantments for thou has trusted in thy wickedness thou has said none seeth me thy wisdom and thy knowledge it hath perverted thee and thou has said in thine heart i am and none else beside me therefore shall evil come upon thee thou shalt not know from whence it riseth and mischief shall fall upon thee thou shalt not be able to put it off and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly which thou shalt not know so it appears then that with the very same outpouring that is literally going to bring a manifestation in the bride will also bring a manifestation in the church we'll also bring a manifestation in israel we'll also start toward the manifestation of the antichrist coming into a personification coming into the full beast and so the mechanics of every group is almost at this time right today in 2021 we're almost done with this year i'm here to tell you all of these mechanics for everything that needs to happen is already in place now and every 24 hours it takes closer and closer to an inevitable irreversible irrevocable i mean listen friends i read in the book of revelation you think i and you think i'm not don't have a heart for for people i've dedicated my whole life to the service of fallen man i'm trying to tell everybody as brother fred says trying to tell everybody about somebody who can help anybody a man and and and you think i don't read the things that jesus prophesies that are coming on the earth terrible you think i don't read the book of revelation and the things that are going to be fall children and old people and the and it doesn't matter it's not going to it's not gonna be racial it's not gonna be national it's not gonna be gender specific it's not gonna respect age and and millions millions and millions and billions even brother brown said are gonna perish according to the book of revelation and i'm here to tell you that breaks my heart that makes my heart bleed but i'm sorry i can't stop it i would if i could hold it back i would the only thing i can do is live here and try to find as many as i can and give them the hope that is in the word of this hour because the mechanics have reached a point now to where everything is set in order you're not you don't have to worry about a future of things coming into order they're in order now malachi 3 1 watch this because here's the other side of it here's the good side malachi 3 1 behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom you delight in behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts so so we realize friends that that i'm i'm reading these scriptures to show you that that when the trumpet of god sounds and we're already well in through the shout well into the stage of the voice and the trumpet of god when that sounds and the dead in christ rise first things are gonna go at lightning speed now you know what the world won't quite realize it they won't realize that they've just been reduced from 6 000 years to 42 months but things will start transitioning so quickly it'll make their head spin they think the world's going crazy now it's cub scouts now compared to what it's going to be i'm here to tell you you don't want to be here i don't want to be here during that time hallelujah we find that laodicea as an age to the world as time is history it doesn't end until the bride goes because the bride is actually the holder of the spirit she's the holder of the word she's the holder of the blood and god's wrath which must come on the gentiles it must come on the gentiles in the form of a great tribulation but it cannot come on the gentiles as long as the gentile bride is here on earth because god cannot pass judgment through blood and prophet said you are the blood of god by the spirit see so the life that was in the blood how did that work how did that happen the life that was in the blood is in her by the baptism of the holy ghost she is the salt of the earth that's how you're the salt of the earth that's how you're the savior that's how you're the non-corrupter that's how you're the preservative because the you have received you are the blood of god by the spirit and god can't unleash judgment and cross over blood you see but once the bride is gone the pr and the preservative is gone oh my that's that's going to be that's going to be a time you're going to find during that time that when moses and elijah go forward you're going to find an unwise virgin that gets left behind i i think that those those unwise virgins are going to gain a lot of strength and a lot of courage from those two international prophets if you ask me i think that god has done it that way on purpose and that uh you say well might they find a message book or might they be somebody we live near might there be a family who knows about the message yeah all all all possible but i'm here to tell you that i think they're going to gain a lot of courage to not take the mark of the beast when they see those two international prophets moving oh my that that gives me a little bit of hope but it also says to me oh if they could just believe now if they could just receive it now my but we find that it's all going to happen friends they may gain strength the message of moses and elijah will so sweep the world that even the the unwise virgin would gain strength from it and and realize enough not to take the mark of the beast you know when we when we think about what god is calling us to when we talk about the dynamics now i want to take my last just my last ten minutes i'm trying to get out of the way quickly because i gotta i'm gonna carry this on in part seven don't worry you're not gonna miss anything but i want to come to this today is that when we talk about the dynamics all right of the holy ghost being a refilling brother man called it a fresh surge he called it a refilling it talks about a dynamics outpouring and a lot of times we we want to look at the supernatural side we want to look at the creation of squirrels and the cursing of a storm and the cursing of a tumor and there's our children being brought to eternal life granted the salvation of our children and and and you know and and all of these various ways that the third poll manifested itself but let me tell you something friends that that what what is is really a more important thing than all of that is that when christ came down one of the last things i mean he had expressed lots of power but one of the last things he expressed was a death and gusting amen see a death in gethsemane it was a a gethsemane death of a total life of commitment a surrendered life of total commitment see not not demonstrations of power like the world looks for because first of all that's already been done i get it i know sometimes i see such hypocrisy you see things you go my goodness if we just had the days of brother branham back again we could go in there and prove it to him brother branham did that seven times around the world for 33 years and he said every time i come to california they're worse and he would go back again and discern their hearts and heal their sick and preach the gospel come back again in their worst so we're not we're not i'm not i'm not denying that that about brother branham speculated possibly missing limbs power of creation i get that and and don't forget in gethsemane jesus operated the power of creation not saying it's absent jesus literally through the power of creation re restored an ear that simon had cut off simon had cut off and jesus just put it back and and healed the man i i heard a preacher saying one time he said i'll promise you simon wasn't aiming for his ear but he got his ear and jesus just said you know put your sword away because simon this is a different hour this is i'm getting ready to go to calvary and there if i if i hope to be successful at calvary i got to be successful at gethsemane i got to be able to lay my life down because the world is looking for a demonstration of power uh you know but but but we find that you know jesus had power to to restore an ear jesus had power to call 12 legions of angels remember that so we're not talking about an absence of power we're not talking about oh i'm not here to disappoint today to say hey no power's coming what i'm here to do today is get you to see a vital part of the opening of the seven seals and that is to bring you to a surrender in gethsemane to where you can get to this greater accomplishment for us to be able to say like the lord when the lord said when the lord said not my will thine be done this was a time i mean jesus had power on the cross to win the thief so you understand even within the third pole yeah there's power there's power for healing there's power for salvation amen there's power for deliverance he healed an ear he could have called angels he saves the thief so you get power for healing in the third pool you get power for deliverance in the third pool you get power to lead the dead and sin to life in the third poll but but on the cross we find that his greatest accomplishment was to say father into thy hands i commend my spirit [Music] see to commend means to place with someone it means to give in charge it means to commit it means to entrust it's very similar to first peter chapter 4 verse 19 wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as unto a faithful creator so when jesus says father i entrust my spirit that's why the nlt renders it that way father i entrust my spirit into your hands and with these words he breathed his last and i just wrote that this morning and i thought about that as i read that and i said lord let me have that same testimony and and and breathe my last as me and say father i commend my life into your hands let me awake and find that i'm you oh god let me have a gethsemane let me have a calvary that's one of the greatest effects that the opening of the seals has done is to bring a bride into the very image of christ as i've said to you over and over and over again it's not about increasing your theology it's about bringing you into his image and that's our greatest that was the greatest purpose in opening the seven seals was to restore the body and blood of christ to the earth that's what as i said to you wednesday that's the very thing that's what connects john 6 except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you that's what connects john 6 to revelation 10 9. go and eat and ask for a little book and and i went and asked and he said you must eat the book this is the same this is the same one this is what jesus was prophesying would come because we're realizing that his body was meat indeed and his and his blood was drink indeed he says for i came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day and that's why jesus constantly was saying to them i am the living bread he just kept repeating it kept repeating it i'm the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and and and the bread that i give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world and the jews were stunned at that you know and and said among themselves man how can this man give us his flesh to eat and the world today is once again just as confused on what he means in revelation 10 9 about eating the book they're just as confused today but to us who understand it to us who have had their word revealed this is our life this is only this is what makes life worth it verily verily i say to you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life i'll raise him up the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed so this is this is the true message restored under the opening of the seals this passage in john 6 is a direct link to revelation 10. because jesus is saying you've got to eat it and the angel which is christ again saying you've got to eat it see and so it's not it's not when we find where he says here watch this he that he's my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him now now you have no excuse to say oh this is only a passage about him no the whole point was to get into you see he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the living father hath sent me and i lived by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers had eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever so it's not getting people to receive our life or receive our thoughts it's but but what it is you know it's not about us lifting ourselves up that's not what it is it's it's it's not you know i'm not trying to get you to have part of my life i'm not here in other words the seventh seal has revealed to me that i'm not here to be about me it's not about my goals it's to lift him up our life is hid in christ and all of my goals are surrendered to christ see it's not a challenge that many can embrace winding down it's not a challenge that many can embrace that even some sadly who've said in the ranks of measures assemblies for years and generations even but for the ones who can for the ones who will these are the ones that are going in the rapture i want to tell you that friends it doesn't matter if you have accepted the theology under the opening of the seven seals and you can quote it forwards and backwards satan doesn't care how right you are in your doctrine you've got to have that gethsemane surrender you've got to be on calvary with christ and you've got to be able to say lord my whole life today everything about me i commend my life into your hands this is what i've been restored to it's all about his goals and his dreams because we we showed you wednesday that that the only that the only eating after that in the whole book of revelation the only eating and drinking is that when we find and we're not going to turn but in revelation 17 you find that that that that the the ten horns that thou sauce upon the beast will hate the and eat her flesh revelation 19 how that uh fowls were called to eat the flesh of kings and and and you realize of course now when you read that you realize that's that's paul's reference in galatians 5 2 devouring one another remember paul says for off for all the laws fulfilled in one word even this that thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself remember love is the person that's the capstone you can't get that love without his life because real love's not a feeling or an emotion now you have a feeling and emotion that we call love but that's just human sensation see that can change in a moment you'll love me until i won't until i stop doing things for you or until i come against you then you won't love me much anymore but this is a love that passes understanding that even when i'm in a trial i know he loves me even when things even when i pray a prayer and things get worse i still know he loves me you understand this is how god operates this is what god is doing in our lives and paul says paul says it that way thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if you do if you bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another this is exactly what happens in the tribulation period to kings and to antichrist because they they they rejected the love of god they rejected the capstone they rejected the opening of the seals and they they did not come into the image of christ they didn't leave the earth when the bride left and they're left here and you know what they do they eat and devour one another the only drinking that takes place is in revelation 14 where they literally drink the wine of the wrath of the fornication of the system oh but i'm going to tell you something friends there is one more drinking that takes place and that is jesus said to those who overcome i'll grant to to drink from the river of what river of life that's the drinking that i want my precious friends that's the hour that we have arrived at that's what god has brought us to in this hour and so so we find that this is the critical critical thing brother brown says this and watch this i'm going to read this and we'll we'll stop in the message turn on the light in 1964 he says i speak in the name of the lord you watch and see if it isn't true the light of the hour those cold creeds can never bring a harvest we've got to have a church that's washed in the blood of the lamb and become one with the word be the church see church glares of this day jesus said our very deceiving almost the elected if it were possible just the elected but as it was in the days of noah when eight souls were saved so shall it be the coming of the son of man and brother iran says very very few will be saved at that time see i'll tell you something friends think about this there's precious little difference between the wise version virgin and the unwise virgin they they both come from the same piece of goods they're it's one piece of fabric and there's a pattern in in inside his election outside his remnant just like a woman that sews she cuts around her pattern but she still has a remnant it's all the same material you understand they have the same material brother branham even talks about they're receiving a seed meaning the word of god but but because they don't receive the engrafted word because they don't receive the living seed and and they don't get the moisture to make it grow they can't because the holy ghost in this age can't anoint a false word and so we we've got to have first of all the restored word and then the dynamics can come and anoint that and change our lives i'm here to tell you something friends you know you look at the foolish virgins say well in the in the in the tribulation she'll probably end up believing this message probably so but it won't help her you understand see you say today say why do you say that brother jason because you might see it today and say well i believe the message well so will she but it won't help her see because she because why brother brown says she never received the moisture to make it grow you've got to have the holy ghost you've got to have that personal experience it's got sitting in message assemblies your whole life multi generations you might have been raised up and be second third and fourth and fifth generations i don't know you might was coming off the street yesterday but i'm here to tell you you've got to have a personal experience with christ that's what the seven seals did that's what the opening of the word accomplished see and and i and i realize of course i'm not here to i mean i realize that that that election uh is the end of it all it trumps everything and i realize that you know there's not going to be any extra placemats at that table thousands of miles long i realize there's also not going to be empty chairs any empty chairs and i'm glad for that but you know something friends when i think of it that way then i i realized wow then if god's not going to be defeated and he's not going to lose you and yet you sit in a message assembly and you haven't really eaten the book you haven't really had that gethsemane surrender of all your life and all your goals and all your dreams you haven't been able to say father and to thy hands i commend my spirit i put my whole life in your hands and and and you know that when you won't come to that and yet then god won't lose any of his own then i'm going to say i'm going to say it like this friends you will come to it or you will be brought to it by the tender hand of jehovah i don't want to go that route i want to say father i surrender right now i surrender listen friends he's restoring garden of eden life that's why brother branham called it a a bride age a bride time a harvest age a harvest time a garden age a garden time what is he doing he's restoring garden life to his family that's what the millennium is all about going back to finish that seventh day he's not merely restoring deep understanding of mysteries no no he's restoring garden life and we're we're now today privileged to be a partaker today you have an access if you want it you can partake directly of the tree of life oh my that this is just as much to do with the coming uh of the lord as the dead saints rising i'll say that again what i'm preaching on today is just as much a part of the coming of the lord it's just as much a part of that coming as as the dead saints rising out of the ground you're you're if you're missing any part of it you're never going to get to see that dead saints rising if this part isn't in your life remember there'll be a very very few at that time there be one of the places there'll be very few make that rapture i want to make it friends i'm in it to win it i'm in it to win the prize i'm running this race that's the reason i'm running see amen stand to your feet with me god bless you this morning we'll stop right there amen that's as far as i needed to get and we'll carry on um next service so i want you just to bow your heads with me all over the building we don't want to switch preachers up here till i've given you an opportunity to have your heart humble before the lord just something tender brother andrew with all your heads bowed now father a rushed and hurried lesson today but it was an important lesson and and i know that you know all things and i know that you you caused lord your people to come to your fountain you caused them lord to keep your statutes that was your promise to ezekiel i'll put my spirit in them and i will cause them to keep my word i'll cause them to keep my statutes i'll cause them to do it lord today we all confess that we're weak mortals and we need the cause of the holy spirit to come upon us lord i raise up my hands and i realize that that father while we're looking for the dynamics of power and miracles and great signs that's not going to change the world that was just something you did privately you had already spent a life of doing miracles lord it hadn't changed israel it hadn't brought them to national repentance you you came in our day you went around the world seven times over three three decades that didn't bring the world to national repentance it only has gotten worse but lord in gethsemane that was a private time that was you and your disciples there's where you demonstrated you still had power to heal oh yes you still had power for deliverance you could have called for 12 legions of angels you still had power right before it was over right near the finish line you were still in full possession of power to redeem the lost and a dying thief said lord remember me and you said today you'll be with me so lord it's not that we're lacking a power but in the in the expectation of power that's so easy human beings tend to that they love sensationalism we're built that way but lord what about gethsemane what about the surrender of our will in gethsemane what about the surrender on the cross when you said father into thy hands i commend my spirit that's part of the that's part of the coming that's part of the restoration just as much as any other part that's what the seventh seal was given for that's what the opening of all seven of them came so that we could not only understand our our understanding of your word and your teaching better but so that we could partake of the tree of life eat the book he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath everlasting life and i'll raise him up at the last day may we be doers of your word today lord i say for me and for this audience and for those streaming the service lord i want to raise up my hand and i'll invite anybody here today and all across the stream you want to raise up your hand and say father help me today to commend my spirit into your hands help me today lord to die with you at calvary and wake up and be be you and me grant it today lord my hand is up i'm sure even without looking around i'm sure there's many other hands lord that desire that same thing help us lord these are terrible times and changing and things are changing so rapidly lord i feel such an urgency in my heart lord uh such an urgency to our young people to say you don't understand how rapidly things are going to transition they're going to move in hours and hours the whole world will transition quickly father it'll be too late then let us let us commend our life into your hands now let us be willing to say today young people old people single married male female red yellow black and white it doesn't matter let us all say today father not my will not my life your life not my will your will into thy hands i commend all my goals into thy hands i commend my plans into thy hands i commend my dreams my hopes i commend them to you i put them i give them into your charge i commit them to you do with me as you see fit lord only let me be like you granted father i commit this whole service today now and what we will carry forth after this into your

be the priest's wife with no children you have to put her away or get another wife she told me that she thinks that the lord will still bless her after all these years i still believe we can have children one day don't you believe it no just come along don't listen to them hmm impossible um do you believe what the rabbi said yesterday that the messiah will come forth even though it has been hundreds of years absolutely all god's words will come to pass that's exactly what i believe too some of the other young people thought that i was silly to think that but i just don't care what they think that's our attitude we can talk about it more later how can this be when i know not a man be it unto me according to thy word behold the handmaiden of the lord i must tell everyone what has happened blessings to you elizabeth how are you i heard you were to become a mother yes but i am worried it is past time that i show i should have felt the baby move but i haven't felt him yet do not fear an angel told me the other week that you would have a baby and i would have one born of the holy ghost he is to be named jesus praise the lord my baby just leaped out of the sound of your baby's name blessed is he that you carry the very lord and flesh my swords magnify the lord and my spirit rejoices in god my savior it's okay do i take it what's his name john no name him after his father you have no relatives named john praise the lord god has remembered his people this child shall prepare the way of the lord god will is full of mercy and the day spring will visit us as a light in darkness and death soon the messiah will come and save us from all of our presses what a mighty general he will be a son from one of our most finest families that depart from us your sacrifice is not already up here he ought to have an easier time finding a parallel lamp but he's just too ignorant to know you better i suppose come let us go and read no i think i'll bear the messiah i'm the elder sister after all these stinking shepherds they only care about sheep heap if they don't care about people people they they're just dumb animals that can't cross the road without a shepherd i heard some people speaking about the messiah again today do you think we'd ever get to see him if he comes while we live no wait i don't think they would let us no we wouldn't be considered worthy the messiah will be found in a stable do not be afraid i bring you great news that will bring joy to all the world christ the savior is born today in bethlehem in a manger and swaddling clothes to think we would get to see the messiah while we live i wonder why the angels came to us we're just lowly shepherds [Music] okay somewhere come and see come and see christ the lord was born last night what that's impossible we will no longer before you daughters of israel oh am i supposed to be up here oh daughters of israel come and see the messiah is come where may we find him he is in a stable with a manger for his cradle impossible the messiah will be born in the palace i'm not going to stink stable people of bethlehem i have seen the save here how would you know you're just a stinking little shepherd so i think just go out [Laughter] across me was she was child was she with child was she with child before they married yes the child is illegitimate then what mockery to bring it to the temple yeah i heard they didn't even bring a lamb they're so sinful i would not die before my eyes had seen the savior and now i have seen him what the glory will be to the jews and delight to the gentiles although he will fall and rise again it will break your heart you will reveal to the people who they really are unburdened by sin glory to the lord behold israel your savior has come who'll forever save you from your sins awesome calm down simmons you're crazy anna you don't even know what you're talking about you spend all your time in the temple and you think you see god everywhere we're not gonna believe you when we have our priests and rabbis that haven't said a word about the messiah's birth just put it on his head it doesn't matter there's a chord does anyone else wish to be baptized for repentance who are you i am the voice in the loneliness crying prepare you the way of the lord if you're not the christ why do you baptize i baptize with water but one will come who will baptize you with the holy ghost behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sins of the world rabbi where do you go come and see yes in the beginning where are you the same was in the beginning with god all that were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not jesus christ was the true light which lighteth every man that come cometh into the word he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but it as many received him to them gave the power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the of the flesh nor the will
