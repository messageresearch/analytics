[54:44] it's wonderful to be in his presence you
[54:47] know I was telling the church the other
[54:48] day it's one thing to be in

[54:53] his presence you can be in his church
[54:56] and come in and go out and come in and
[54:58] go out and never be changed but there's
[55:00] not one time you can walk into his
[55:02] presence and ever remain the same and I
[55:06] believe you have done your part this
[55:08] morning as a congregation and set an
[55:10] atmosphere to where he's
[55:13] here he's here not just brother Joe or
[55:16] brother Jason or brother Tony or any of
[55:18] the song specials but he is here in our
[55:21] midst and when he is here Supernatural
[55:24] things can take place when he is here
[55:27] chains can fall off when he is here
[55:30] lives can be
[55:31] retransformed so we just thank the Lord
[55:33] for that this morning brother Jason
[55:35] thank you for the invitation I know it's
[55:37] been a few years but you know your
[55:39] pastor doesn't just have anybody stand
[55:41] behind this
[55:43] desk not just anybody but a man that he
[55:46] has confidence in so I I take that with
[55:49] high regard and thankful for the
[55:51] opportunity and to be here to share what
[55:54] the Lord has put on our heart I will say
[55:55] I've been up since 6:30 this morning
[55:57] studying seeking the mind of God for the
[55:59] service today I've wrestled through
[56:02] different thoughts different things
[56:03] seems like Satan's trying to come and
[56:05] block the blessing but I believe we
[56:07] rested this morning on a thought and we
[56:09] want to look into that this morning but
[56:11] as we do uh bring you greetings from our
[56:14] pastor brother Tim the Saints there even
[56:15] like Tabernacle we just want to go to
[56:17] him in prayer as we turn before we turn
[56:19] to John 14 but father how we thank you
[56:22] today
[56:23] Lord Lord we thank you for your presence
[56:26] we feel you so near right
[56:28] now thank you for the charge of the Holy
[56:31] Spirit Lord that we're not just another
[56:33] Pentecost Lord that just gets emotional
[56:35] with song but Lord there's a word that's
[56:38] charging our hearts Lord there's a life
[56:40] that's behind that word and behind every
[56:42] song a life behind every special Lord
[56:45] that just encourages us oh God and Lord
[56:49] we're so thankful for this message
[56:50] you've given us in this day thank you
[56:52] for that deposit of the Holy Ghost In
[56:54] Our Lives Lord and Lord thank you for
[56:57] all that you are doing and all that you
[56:59] have done and we know father that you
[57:01] ever remain the same and even when we're
[57:03] not faithful you remain faithful Lord
[57:07] and I'm asking today Father you will
[57:09] remain faithful to the needs of your
[57:11] people God you saw the burdens in which
[57:13] they brought into this building this
[57:16] morning and I know that you're a mindful
[57:18] God I know you're able to take your
[57:19] subject your Your Vessel this morning
[57:22] and move him off of his notes and Lord
[57:24] like a surgeon's hand begin to cut and
[57:27] begin to minister and begin to deal with
[57:29] that heart that need that situation so
[57:32] father we invite you not just me as the
[57:34] speaker but we as the hearer as well we
[57:37] invite you to perform the operation this
[57:39] morning amen may you get all the glory
[57:43] all the honor Lord for everything that
[57:46] will be spoken today May it not be from
[57:48] a man's thought from a man's intellect
[57:51] but it may be from the inspiration of
[57:53] the holy spirit for we ask at this
[57:56] morning in Jesus name amen if you have
[57:58] your Bibles we're going to look here in
[57:59] John 14 and:
[58:04] 16 John 14 and verse 16 now this passage
[58:09] here through Verse 18 is actually the
[58:11] promise of the Holy Ghost so we kind of
[58:13] want to pick up on that this morning I'm
[58:15] going look at here says
[58:17] and I will pray the father and he shall
[58:20] give you another comforter what a
[58:22] promise amen I will pray to the father
[58:26] and he shall give you another comforter
[58:29] that he may abide with you forever even
[58:31] the spirit of Truth whom the world
[58:32] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[58:35] neither knoweth him but you know him for
[58:37] he dwelleth with you and shall be in You
[58:41] Verse 18 I will not leave you
[58:45] comfortless what you say brother Joe
[58:47] went Le I will not leave you comforter
[58:52] brother Joe you don't understand what
[58:53] I'm going through I will not leave
[58:56] you comfor you don't understand what's
[58:58] going on in my family what's going on in
[59:00] my marriage it does not matter I will
[59:04] not leave you comers I will come to you
[59:10] amen God bless you you can have your
[59:12] seats this morning also want to pick up
[59:15] here in the book of Acts chapter 1 and
[59:17] verse
[59:18] one book of Acts chapter 1 and verse one
[59:21] I want to speak to you this morning on
[59:22] the Winds of Pentecost still blow
[59:27] I don't know if y'all heard that this
[59:28] morning the Winds of Pentecost still
[59:32] blow we're not talking about isua we're
[59:34] talking about the real deal The Winds of
[59:37] Pentecost still blowing and we find here
[59:38] in Acts 1 and verse one says a former
[59:41] treaties have I made o theopus all that
[59:44] Jesus began both to do and to teach
[59:46] until the day in which he was taken up
[59:48] after he through the Holy Ghost had
[59:51] given Commandments unto the apostles
[59:53] whom he had chosen to whom also he
[59:55] showed himself alive after his Passion
[59:58] by many infallible proofs being seen of
[1:00:01] them 40 days and speaking of things
[1:00:03] pertaining to the kingdom of God and
[1:00:05] being assembled together with them he
[1:00:07] commanded them that they should not
[1:00:08] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[1:00:11] promise of the Father which saith he you
[1:00:13] have heard of me for John truly baptized
[1:00:16] with water but you shall be baptized
[1:00:18] with the Holy Ghost not many days hence
[1:00:21] when they therefore were come together
[1:00:23] they asked him saying Lord will thou
[1:00:26] this time restore again the Kingdom of
[1:00:27] Israel and he said unto them it is not
[1:00:29] for you to know the times or the seasons
[1:00:32] which the father has put in his own
[1:00:34] power but ye shall receive power after
[1:00:38] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:00:40] and you shall be a witness unto me both
[1:00:42] in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria
[1:00:45] and under to the uttermost parts of the
[1:00:48] earth so we want to take this thought
[1:00:50] just for a little bit this
[1:00:54] morning thank you sir
[1:00:59] when I look here and think about this
[1:01:01] The Winds of Pentecost still blowing we
[1:01:03] find in John 14 there's a promise of the
[1:01:06] Holy Spirit that's given to us even into
[1:01:09] this hour and the age and we're living
[1:01:10] in and we look here in uh acts 1 and
[1:01:13] verse 8 the Bible says you shall receive
[1:01:15] power that word power is the word
[1:01:18] dunamus that means power to perform
[1:01:21] Miracles it's an inherit power and that
[1:01:24] word inherit there means it's a
[1:01:25] permanent power it's not like a power
[1:01:27] when one man gives you a power and
[1:01:29] authority and just a few days later he
[1:01:31] can remove that power and authority from
[1:01:34] you but it's an inherent power it's a
[1:01:36] permanent power it's a permanent
[1:01:38] Authority and we find here that God says
[1:01:41] or Jesus tell us I'm going to give you
[1:01:43] power damous power power to perform
[1:01:48] Miracles let me tell you the god that we
[1:01:50] serve is not some weak God that he
[1:01:52] doesn't have the ability to do what he
[1:01:54] says he will do
[1:01:56] and some of us here this morning we may
[1:01:58] have situations that may seem just a
[1:02:01] little bit too big for us as humans to
[1:02:03] handle maybe a little bit impossible
[1:02:05] maybe we have children that are wavered
[1:02:07] we have situations that are gone to
[1:02:09] around but I want you to know he will do
[1:02:11] what he says he will do because he's the
[1:02:15] same yesterday today and
[1:02:18] forever but notice they had to be in
[1:02:21] back in the book of Acts 2 and verse one
[1:02:23] it says when the day of Pentecost was
[1:02:25] fully come
[1:02:27] they were in one Accord in one place
[1:02:29] they wasn't complaining they wern't
[1:02:30] bickering they wern't fussing they
[1:02:32] wern't stewing over little different
[1:02:35] things but we find today amongst the
[1:02:38] ranks of the messes you know we're
[1:02:40] debating over ideas right we're debating
[1:02:44] over what brother brandham said and what
[1:02:46] he meant by this and what he meant by
[1:02:48] that and how this one received this and
[1:02:50] how one looks at this but the Bible says
[1:02:52] they were in one mind and one Accord
[1:02:55] there's a 120 men and women up you think
[1:02:58] they all thought just alike come on come
[1:03:01] on some how many of you are married this
[1:03:04] morning don't be afraid to raise your
[1:03:06] hand you and your husband or you and
[1:03:08] your wife don't see eye to eye on
[1:03:11] everything but you're still married
[1:03:13] you're still in the same house and we
[1:03:16] find here they're not up there bickering
[1:03:18] about that do Peter may have had
[1:03:19] different ideas and though John may have
[1:03:22] had different ideas though Mary may have
[1:03:24] had different ideas look their different
[1:03:26] ideas didn't make him any less a
[1:03:28] Believer their different ideas didn't
[1:03:30] make him any less a a son and daughter
[1:03:32] of God their own ideas didn't make him
[1:03:35] any less a brother or sister it made
[1:03:38] them human and your ideas make you human
[1:03:41] this morning but they were in one mind
[1:03:43] they were in one Accord they knew we
[1:03:45] were going somewhere and we're going to
[1:03:47] wait until the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:50] came let me tell you church we may have
[1:03:52] different ideas this morning we may had
[1:03:54] different doctrinal beliefs this morning
[1:03:56] but we must be in one mind that he is
[1:03:59] coming and when he comes I'm
[1:04:01] leaving I said when he comes I'm
[1:04:05] leaving
[1:04:07] god notice here they had an
[1:04:11] expectation for the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:13] Ghost their ideas may have varied they
[1:04:16] didn't see everything exactly the same
[1:04:18] but they did agree on one
[1:04:21] thing I don't think personally me I
[1:04:24] don't believe that we as a message
[1:04:26] Community as preachers and ministers
[1:04:29] pastors evangelists I don't think we're
[1:04:31] ever going to see everything exactly the
[1:04:34] same there's groups here that believe
[1:04:36] one thing and there's groups that
[1:04:37] believe maybe something else now I'm not
[1:04:39] talking about false teaching I'm not
[1:04:41] talking about false Doctrine I'm just
[1:04:43] talking about the doctrines that we
[1:04:44] agree on we may not agree exactly the
[1:04:47] same and we find here that in our
[1:04:50] Humanity we will allow these
[1:04:52] disagreements and we'll allow these
[1:04:53] variances to cause separation
[1:04:57] brother Jason and I was not too long ago
[1:04:58] I was preaching somewhere I didn't I
[1:05:00] didn't know what the the the brothers
[1:05:02] believed and I preached what I what I
[1:05:04] believed and felt led to preach it well
[1:05:06] you know I didn't realize but a few
[1:05:08] months later they had a holy Concord
[1:05:10] Wonder should we let this brother preach
[1:05:11] anymore in our churches wow you know it
[1:05:14] reminds me of brother B we were just
[1:05:16] listening to it the other day the
[1:05:17] godhead explained brother B talked about
[1:05:19] these brothers they were splitting hairs
[1:05:21] over baptism in Jesus name or father son
[1:05:24] Holy Ghost and one of the brothers he
[1:05:26] come to brother brand he said that man
[1:05:28] you had a sinner on your platform this
[1:05:30] evening he says what do you mean a
[1:05:32] sinner he's a he's a Pentecostal
[1:05:34] preacher he's a Oneness preacher he said
[1:05:36] that you know he was baptized wrong
[1:05:38] therefore he was a sinner he said
[1:05:40] brother Brandon we're going to draw you
[1:05:41] out of our Circle but you know what a
[1:05:43] prophet of God did he said you can't
[1:05:45] draw me out because I'll draw another
[1:05:48] Circle and draw you back in what about
[1:05:50] us as a message Community taking that
[1:05:52] same kind of approach instead of kicking
[1:05:55] and men to the curve because they don't
[1:05:57] see it all eye to eye and we may believe
[1:05:59] but what about the life behind the
[1:06:02] individual what about the life behind it
[1:06:06] how we want to split hairs and disagree
[1:06:08] we're always not going to see everything
[1:06:10] out of eye but my goodness can't we see
[1:06:13] that God's coming for a people can't we
[1:06:15] be a people that'll draw a circle a
[1:06:16] little bit bigger sir somebody want to
[1:06:18] draw you out cuz you don't see it his
[1:06:20] way or her way just draw a bigger Circle
[1:06:23] draw them back in welcome them back in
[1:06:26] but notice the Bible says in Acts 2 it
[1:06:28] says and when the day of Pentecost was
[1:06:30] fully
[1:06:31] come they were all in one Accord in one
[1:06:35] place amen now we're all here this
[1:06:38] morning we're not all in one Accord just
[1:06:40] yet on but we're in one place all right
[1:06:45] can I get a smile on some of you yeah
[1:06:47] we're going to get you in one Accord for
[1:06:49] us so with Lord
[1:06:50] willing and the Bible says and suddenly
[1:06:53] there came a sound from heaven as of a
[1:06:57] rushing Mighty
[1:07:00] Wind let me just say this this is not
[1:07:02] some little gentle breeze that lows you
[1:07:05] asleep M was a rushing Mighty this word
[1:07:08] rushing there it suggests force and
[1:07:11] speed is a mighty win a forceable win
[1:07:15] and the word there means Breath of
[1:07:19] Life so here they are 120 Believers in
[1:07:22] an upper room doing what Jesus told them
[1:07:24] to do but all of a sudden they were in
[1:07:27] one mind one Accord waiting for the
[1:07:29] power of the spirit of God to come and
[1:07:32] suddenly there came a sound like a
[1:07:34] rushing Mighty Wind it was a powerful
[1:07:37] wind it had force behind it cuz when
[1:07:39] they walked out of there brother George
[1:07:41] they didn't walk out the same that they
[1:07:43] came in they walked out different they
[1:07:45] walked out sealed they walked out filled
[1:07:47] with the Holy Ghost they met the rushing
[1:07:50] Mighty Wind of
[1:07:52] Pentecost and the Winds of Pentecost
[1:07:54] begin to blow and it didn't stop blowing
[1:07:57] in the upper room it didn't stop blowing
[1:07:59] on the day of Pentecost when they walked
[1:08:01] out they staggered like drunk
[1:08:04] men and the Bible said 3,000 were added
[1:08:07] to them like
[1:08:08] that but we find today we want to cut
[1:08:11] the winds
[1:08:14] off we're afraid of the Winds of
[1:08:18] Pentecost or let me say it like this
[1:08:20] we're
[1:08:22] ashamed we're ashamed
[1:08:25] you know we didn't got so dignified in
[1:08:27] this message out let me just tell you
[1:08:29] y'all just saw an undignified preacher
[1:08:31] last night some of y'all that were here
[1:08:34] you saw me jerking and quirking and then
[1:08:37] you saw me dancing and then you know
[1:08:40] hey I want to give God
[1:08:43] everything amen but we find here notice
[1:08:47] this wind was not just a gentle
[1:08:50] breeze but it was a mighty force and I
[1:08:53] believe when God comes into your life
[1:08:56] he's going to do
[1:08:58] something he's not going to lower you to
[1:09:00] sleep you sit on a church pew and you
[1:09:01] just nod your head fight to stay awake
[1:09:04] come
[1:09:05] on come on church but no he's going to
[1:09:09] come in with Force because he wants to
[1:09:10] change who you are and Jesus tells us in
[1:09:14] John 11:25 Jesus said unto her he
[1:09:16] speaking to a lady here he says I am the
[1:09:18] resurrection and the life and he that
[1:09:21] believeth on me though he were dead yet
[1:09:23] shall he live in verse 26 and whosoever
[1:09:26] liveth and believeth on me shall never
[1:09:29] die believest thou
[1:09:32] this do we still believe this today as a
[1:09:35] message Community do we still believe
[1:09:37] this today as Believers and we find in
[1:09:40] John 14:26 Jesus said unto him I am the
[1:09:43] way I am the truth and the life right so
[1:09:48] when we look at Pentecost and the the
[1:09:50] word wi here means a breath of life we
[1:09:52] can take it back to John 14 and realize
[1:09:55] this was nothing but Jesus coming inside
[1:09:58] coming there the Breath of Life the word
[1:10:00] of life the way of life the truth of
[1:10:02] life and he's coming to do what impart
[1:10:05] his life to the believer and I believe
[1:10:07] that's what he wants to do in the
[1:10:08] believing people today that's why we
[1:10:10] have us camps that's why we had special
[1:10:13] meetings that's why we have church
[1:10:14] services so the Winds of Pentecost can
[1:10:17] blow in and blow the trash out of our
[1:10:20] Lives
[1:10:23] God to come in and you know but we have
[1:10:26] to welcome it yes so on the day of
[1:10:29] Pentecost brother BR would say the logos
[1:10:32] was dividing himself among the people
[1:10:35] exactly the logos the word was dividing
[1:10:38] himself so it wasn't Peter are these
[1:10:42] great men and you know we we we tend to
[1:10:44] hold certain men up on certain
[1:10:48] pedestals but it's not great men it's
[1:10:51] the holy
[1:10:53] spirit so notice here this was not just
[1:10:56] a power to perform Miracles that they
[1:10:59] received but it was a power to believe
[1:11:02] the full word of God right right to live
[1:11:04] a Victorious Life to Live above sin live
[1:11:08] free from sin nature this was a power to
[1:11:11] believe for your
[1:11:13] prodal see the very same life that was
[1:11:16] in Jesus was now being divided among the
[1:11:20] 120 amen and I will say this today we
[1:11:24] have the blessing
[1:11:25] of
[1:11:26] Pentecost it's not it's not something of
[1:11:30] yesterday but I believe this message
[1:11:32] brother Jason this message introduced us
[1:11:35] to Jesus Christ he said well brother Joe
[1:11:38] what about those in Pentecost didn't
[1:11:40] they get the Holy Ghost I believe they
[1:11:42] had a touch of the Holy Ghost I believe
[1:11:44] they had a form of the Holy Ghost but to
[1:11:46] say that they had the person of the Holy
[1:11:48] Ghost i' say I I have to disagree
[1:11:50] because why else would the message need
[1:11:52] to come I believe God sent a message in
[1:11:56] this hour if Pentecost was orza was the
[1:11:59] finality of the word then why did God
[1:12:02] have to send the prophet to turn the
[1:12:04] hearts of the people God sent a prophet
[1:12:07] to turn the hearts of the people to
[1:12:09] introduce to you once again the same
[1:12:12] life the same power the same anointing
[1:12:15] the same Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ in
[1:12:18] Bride
[1:12:19] form so God had to send a
[1:12:23] message he had to send a message and
[1:12:27] notice it can't come in any other age it
[1:12:30] couldn't come in any other generation it
[1:12:31] come now he shows who you are it's come
[1:12:35] to you it come knocking on your door he
[1:12:37] Reveals His word to you not just a
[1:12:40] letter cuz men had the letter down
[1:12:42] through many ages and the letter kth but
[1:12:45] the spirit is what gives
[1:12:46] life but in our day in this day we have
[1:12:50] a message from God and this message
[1:12:53] endues us with a
[1:12:56] supernatural
[1:12:59] power you young kids this message works
[1:13:03] just as well for you as it does Mama and
[1:13:06] Dad this message will get you young boys
[1:13:09] to turn off that computer screen when
[1:13:11] you're tempted to look at things you

[1:13:15] you young girls get your head out of
[1:13:17] those Love Story magazines and fanze
[1:13:19] about how it's going to be no this
[1:13:22] message will turn you back to the truth
[1:13:24] the talents of the word and give you a
[1:13:27] holy conscience give you a thinking
[1:13:29] man's
[1:13:30] filter it'll do it for you it's done it
[1:13:33] for many of us has it done it for you
[1:13:34] brother Jason has it done it for you
[1:13:36] brother Brad brother Luther let me tell
[1:13:38] you young people this message
[1:13:41] Works what the Baptist Church couldn't
[1:13:43] do what the Pentecostal Church couldn't
[1:13:45] do look I walked through the Baptist
[1:13:47] Church I sat through the Pentecostal
[1:13:49] church and what it couldn't do when I
[1:13:51] came to this message let me tell you the
[1:13:53] Winds of Pentecost blew in and it blew
[1:13:56] the trash out of my life and it changed
[1:13:59] me let me tell you brother gide I've
[1:14:01] never had one desire to go
[1:14:05] back not one desire to go back brother
[1:14:09] George I never desire to go back to
[1:14:12] drinking back dep parted I don't wake up
[1:14:14] every day wishing I could go back now
[1:14:17] because it
[1:14:19] works it works I'm here to tell you it
[1:14:21] works and if you will let the Winds of
[1:14:23] Pentecost blow across your heart this
[1:14:25] morning it'll do the same thing for you
[1:14:27] whatever your need is it'll blow there
[1:14:30] it'll move it'll repair a
[1:14:32] marriage let me tell you when the
[1:14:34] shrinks can't repair the marriage when
[1:14:36] the doctors can't repair the marriage
[1:14:37] you let the Holy Ghost get a hold of
[1:14:39] that couple it'll repair the
[1:14:43] marriage brother B would tell us this he
[1:14:45] says now this is in the Ephesian Church
[1:14:48] age he goes now if in
[1:14:51] fact it might be called the Keystone of
[1:14:54] the B Bible it's the Revelation that God
[1:14:57] never
[1:14:59] changes if you don't get anything out of
[1:15:01] this message this morning I want you to
[1:15:02] get that God never
[1:15:04] changes what he was he is and what he
[1:15:08] did he
[1:15:09] does did you hear me what he was he is
[1:15:13] and what he did he still does so he says
[1:15:16] now it's the Revelation that God never
[1:15:19] changes and that's his ways are all
[1:15:23] unchangeable as he
[1:15:25] is then he goes into Hebrews 138 and
[1:15:28] that's our famous scripture Jesus Christ
[1:15:31] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:15:34] Ecclesiastes 3 and verse1 14 I know that
[1:15:37] whosoever God or whatsoever God doeth it
[1:15:40] shall be forever nothing can be put to
[1:15:42] it nor anything taken from it and God
[1:15:45] doeth it that men should fear before him
[1:15:48] that which has been is now and that
[1:15:50] which is to be hath already been see God
[1:15:54] doesn't change
[1:15:55] you know what men change ideas change
[1:15:58] politics change churches change but
[1:16:00] God's word never changes and if it was
[1:16:03] the the truth at the beginning then it's
[1:16:06] got to be the same today let me tell you
[1:16:08] if it if it worked back in Paul's day
[1:16:11] and Peter's Day and John's day and
[1:16:13] Martin's day and Columbus Day and
[1:16:15] William brandom's day let me tell you it
[1:16:18] will work today Church it'll save the
[1:16:20] Lost it'll heal the sick it'll fill with
[1:16:23] the Holy Ghost because he cannot change
[1:16:26] he's an unchanging
[1:16:30] God he said here it is an unchanging God
[1:16:34] with unchanging ways
[1:16:37] my my an unchanging God with unchanging
[1:16:41] ways what did he do in the first he
[1:16:44] saids what he did in the first he will
[1:16:46] have to keep doing until it's done in
[1:16:47] the last time so other words brother I'm
[1:16:50] saying what he did in the first
[1:16:53] age Paul's age
[1:16:55] We Believe Paul to be a mighty Messenger
[1:16:57] right we believe they had signs and
[1:16:59] wonders in the Supernatural in Paul's
[1:17:01] day right he said what he did in the
[1:17:03] first age he will have to continue doing
[1:17:06] down to to the last age well brother Joe
[1:17:10] we're in Lea that's been seven Church
[1:17:13] ages that doesn't matter time doesn't
[1:17:16] stop God God's word Remains the Same he
[1:17:20] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:17:26] and what he did then he must do today to
[1:17:28] be God cuz if he changes then he's not
[1:17:32] God if he changes his word one iota then
[1:17:35] what are we standing on we're people
[1:17:38] most miserable that's right but we find
[1:17:41] here what God did in the first church
[1:17:43] age is what he wants to do in all Church
[1:17:48] ages so you can take your Bible and you
[1:17:51] can go back to the book of Acts and you
[1:17:53] can walk yourself through the Church
[1:17:55] ages you can walk yourself through the
[1:17:57] New Testament and you can see what God's
[1:17:59] is expecting to do in this
[1:18:02] age you can see it you're not blinded to
[1:18:06] it it's not what some man Twist on it
[1:18:08] let me tell you the word of God is not
[1:18:09] up for
[1:18:11] debate so we find in the first church in
[1:18:15] Paul's day God came down and he breathed
[1:18:18] the Breath of Life on the church at
[1:18:19] Pentecost no longer were there a
[1:18:22] powerless group of individuals merely
[1:18:24] follow following some teacher who they
[1:18:26] claim was a good teacher but now they
[1:18:28] receive power the same one that opened
[1:18:31] the blinded eyes the same one that
[1:18:33] healed the leper the same one that
[1:18:35] raised the de that same life that was in
[1:18:37] that individual Jesus Christ is now
[1:18:40] living amongst
[1:18:43] 120 that's why he tells us today in Mark
[1:18:46] 16 we can lay hands on the
[1:18:49] sick it's the same power it's the same
[1:18:51] life it's the same God it's the same
[1:18:53] manifestation he never changes so if it
[1:18:57] work for them in that day won't it work
[1:18:59] for us in this day if it heal those in
[1:19:02] that day won't it heal for us in this
[1:19:04] day if it delivered them in that day
[1:19:06] won't it Deliver Us in this day if it
[1:19:09] brought our particles back in that day
[1:19:11] let me tell you w't it bring your
[1:19:12] prodical back in this
[1:19:18] day now the life of the
[1:19:21] almighty the creator of heavens and
[1:19:24] earth is is now indwelling of
[1:19:27] people brother would tell us like this
[1:19:30] de he is not in
[1:19:33] heaven he said the one who created the
[1:19:36] heavens and the Earth the worlds and
[1:19:38] everything he said de he said deity is
[1:19:42] not in heaven de is in you and you and
[1:19:47] you and you I mean you look at yourself
[1:19:50] and you see flaws don't you some of you
[1:19:53] looked in the mirror this morning and
[1:19:54] screen
[1:19:55] a oh
[1:19:57] my cuz we see our failures we know our
[1:20:01] flaws some of you need to be honest with
[1:20:05] yourself amen but when we look into the
[1:20:08] mirror of God's word we look away from
[1:20:10] what we see and we start seeing
[1:20:12] ourselves the way he sees
[1:20:16] us so now deity is dwelling in humanity
[1:20:20] the life of the creator has come down
[1:20:21] and empowered the people what did he
[1:20:23] Empower you four so you can sit on a Pew
[1:20:26] and say Amen sir cuz not everybody in a
[1:20:29] church service knows how to say
[1:20:31] amen I think we got a bunch of Bobby
[1:20:34] head dolls today what they want to do to
[1:20:35] nod their
[1:20:37] head Bible says Make a Joyful Noise you
[1:20:40] can shout it didn't say Make a Joyful
[1:20:42] nod but I'll take a nod from some of you
[1:20:44] I mean that's
[1:20:48] okay but notice the one that they had
[1:20:50] read the one that they had been
[1:20:52] following the one that they've seen do
[1:20:53] the supernatural
[1:20:55] now that same life was now living in
[1:20:58] them manifesting in them now then when
[1:21:02] they went out when they laid hands on
[1:21:04] the sick the same power that was in
[1:21:06] their Christ their Messiah now perform
[1:21:08] the same Works through their
[1:21:13] lives so what he did then he does
[1:21:18] today now I know there's teachers today
[1:21:20] and preachers today that they don't want
[1:21:21] to believe that they want to believe and
[1:21:23] I'm going to get a little bit ahead of
[1:21:24] myself but they don't believe that the
[1:21:26] that the signs and wonders should be
[1:21:28] amongst the people we got the revealed
[1:21:30] word you're exactly right we got the
[1:21:32] revealed word we got the restored word
[1:21:34] you believe that you believe God sent
[1:21:37] you a prophet and he tied the loose sins
[1:21:39] up and he opened the seals on the back
[1:21:41] of the book and it become a new book we
[1:21:43] got the restored word well if we got the
[1:21:45] restored word shouldn't we also have the
[1:21:47] restored power shouldn't we have the
[1:21:50] same power the same anointing the same
[1:21:53] Holy Ghost oh come on church we claim we
[1:21:57] got it then let's practice it let's put
[1:21:59] it in action Let The Winds of Pentecost
[1:22:01] blow
[1:22:03] [Applause]
[1:22:04] through he's an unchanging
[1:22:07] God brother said the word can't change
[1:22:10] or be changed because the word is
[1:22:16] God now brother Jason can get a
[1:22:18] different thought I'm picking on you cuz
[1:22:20] you're up here now you're a great
[1:22:22] preacher I ain't saying you're not
[1:22:25] put that out there brother Tony right
[1:22:27] both of us will be in
[1:22:30] trouble but brother Jason can study you
[1:22:34] know and maybe a year from now he
[1:22:36] realizes maybe I didn't see that quite
[1:22:38] as clear as I do
[1:22:40] now so he can change his
[1:22:43] viewpoint but what we've done around the
[1:22:45] mess is we done got so hob knobby and
[1:22:47] snobbish I can't believe he said he was
[1:22:50] wrong we got men preaching era that
[1:22:52] they've been preaching for 20 years cuz
[1:22:54] they refuse to be corrected by the
[1:22:56] word because this is what they've always
[1:22:59] known well let me tell you what you've
[1:23:00] always known may have not been always
[1:23:02] correct even your Prophet had to grow in
[1:23:05] his
[1:23:06] Revelation even he changed his stance on
[1:23:09] certain things so that he can fulfill
[1:23:12] the word of God and bring you a complete
[1:23:18] message see men can change change our
[1:23:22] ideas we seek and we can see things
[1:23:24] different but God can never change his
[1:23:26] word can never change he said in John 1
[1:23:28] in the beginning was the word the Word
[1:23:30] was God and the Word was with God so we
[1:23:33] find God can't change he is the
[1:23:35] infallible word of God and he says now
[1:23:39] thus what the church was at Pentecost is
[1:23:43] the standard amen oh uh oh come on come
[1:23:48] on oh oh that hurt brother Joe you mean
[1:23:51] said tell me Pentecost was to stand
[1:23:54] under I'm not telling you was I'm
[1:23:55] telling you it
[1:23:56] is and not was it is the it's still the
[1:23:59] standard
[1:24:01] today amen he said that is the pattern
[1:24:04] there is no other pattern no matter what
[1:24:07] the scholars say God has not changeed
[1:24:10] the pattern what God did at Pentecost he
[1:24:13] has to keep doing until the church ages
[1:24:17] close and let me ask you when does the
[1:24:20] final leoty in church age close out it
[1:24:23] closes out when the bride is lifted out
[1:24:25] of here and when the bride is lifted out
[1:24:28] of here the church ages closed and God
[1:24:30] returns back to the Jews but until that
[1:24:32] time he must do the same thing that he
[1:24:35] did at
[1:24:36] Pentecost and if he does the same thing
[1:24:39] it's got to produce the same
[1:24:41] works it's got to produce the same kind
[1:24:43] of
[1:24:45] believer you say we got to get emotional
[1:24:47] some of you will some of you won't it's
[1:24:50] not in
[1:24:52] you but you got a respon to the word see
[1:24:56] our response sometimes if you're like me
[1:24:58] I'm all excited and you know I act nutty
[1:25:01] up
[1:25:02] here Glory my wife don't say that all
[1:25:05] the time would you calm
[1:25:08] down but I love this message and I don't
[1:25:13] care how I look to anybody cuz I'm not
[1:25:15] here to please anybody I'm here to
[1:25:17] please him and I definitely ain't
[1:25:18] worried about what the devil thinks
[1:25:20] about it but I'm not trying to say you
[1:25:22] got to measure up to my level full of
[1:25:24] emotion and intensity because you may
[1:25:26] never get there but whatever God has
[1:25:29] called you to do if it be a hand lifted
[1:25:31] to God then you lift that hand to God
[1:25:33] and you defy the enemy and tell them I
[1:25:36] believe in the Living God I believe that
[1:25:38] he's the same yesterday if it's a tear
[1:25:40] that comes out of your eye then cry your
[1:25:42] tears for him and give God the worship
[1:25:45] that he
[1:25:47] deserves I'm not asking you to jump I'm
[1:25:50] not asking you to shout I'm not asking
[1:25:51] you to dance I'm just asking you to
[1:25:53] respond to the
[1:25:56] word cuz your response may be different
[1:25:58] than
[1:26:01] mine he said the church at Pentecost is
[1:26:05] the standard how many of you believe
[1:26:07] he's a prophet am yes sir did I we're
[1:26:10] not debating
[1:26:11] it Pentecost not isua
[1:26:15] Pentecost not isua Pentecost I've been
[1:26:18] to isua I was at isua two months ago I
[1:26:20] was at isusa Street there's nothing left
[1:26:23] the building is gone
[1:26:25] you walk downa it may be a 200 yard road
[1:26:28] and that's it you wouldn't even know it
[1:26:30] was there unless the sign was up
[1:26:32] there but the isua that he's talking
[1:26:35] about the or not the isua but the
[1:26:36] Pentecost that he's talking about it's
[1:26:38] still there because it ain't a place it
[1:26:42] ain't an event let me tell you it's an
[1:26:43] experience and the same experience that
[1:26:46] they had then we can have today the same
[1:26:49] Winds of Pentecost that changed to 120
[1:26:52] can come inside here this morning and
[1:26:54] change 120 it can set you on fire it can
[1:26:58] make your walk out different it can
[1:26:59] change your family Dynamics for eternity
[1:27:03] amen just let the winds blow
[1:27:08] through but we're afraid I remember when
[1:27:12] I first came to the
[1:27:13] message Man people you didn't say
[1:27:15] nothing about Pentecost was a derogatory
[1:27:18] word this 20 something years ago telling
[1:27:21] my
[1:27:22] age man you said Pentecost they like no
[1:27:26] we're not
[1:27:28] Pentecostal we're not Pentecostal no
[1:27:30] maybe we're not by denomination
[1:27:33] right but what we found when a prophet
[1:27:35] left the
[1:27:36] scene Pentecost I would had to admit the
[1:27:40] denomination they were
[1:27:42] fanatical they put more on their music
[1:27:44] Let Me Tell You someone would love to
[1:27:46] have some of this black grass we got
[1:27:47] going around here man I'm back here
[1:27:51] trying to study and I'm like woo woo I
[1:27:54] got to get out
[1:27:56] there I ain't never heard black grass
[1:27:58] brother Tony but I'm tell you what it's
[1:28:00] got something in
[1:28:01] it had to make a dead man
[1:28:05] dance wo they must have played Black
[1:28:07] grass when Jesus spoke to Lazarus all
[1:28:09] right said come forth he come out
[1:28:12] dancing
[1:28:15] woo I tell you that Music Man y'all
[1:28:17] y'all got it going
[1:28:19] on I thought he was kidding he ain't
[1:28:22] kidding brother J said you going to love
[1:28:23] our music music it gets loud I'm like
[1:28:26] louder the better cuz you know what
[1:28:28] happens when the music gets loud when
[1:28:30] you can't sing like me you can sing loud
[1:28:32] cuz they can't hear
[1:28:35] you you really feel like you making a
[1:28:37] Joyful Noise to the Lord that's all
[1:28:39] right but we find thees this community
[1:28:41] we we're afraid of
[1:28:43] Pentecost you know we we think we're
[1:28:46] associated with the
[1:28:48] fanaticism and so what happened when
[1:28:50] brother Brandon went off the scene is
[1:28:52] that we went into another side of the
[1:28:53] ditch
[1:28:56] it's the ditch of formalism well we got
[1:28:59] the word we don't need all
[1:29:01] that we got the word word word word word
[1:29:04] word word but the Bible says the letter
[1:29:07] kill it but what we have done as a
[1:29:10] message Community for so long we shut
[1:29:12] the spirit out cuz we didn't want to be
[1:29:14] identified as a fanatic we didn't want
[1:29:18] to be identified with those dancers
[1:29:20] those tongue speakers those blobber
[1:29:22] Hallelujah those little act 238
[1:29:25] screaming young let me tell you there
[1:29:26] ain't nothing better to be identified
[1:29:28] with than some ACT screaming 238 knowing
[1:29:31] you got the Holy Ghost and you're going
[1:29:33] to make a Rapture that's what I'm
[1:29:35] talking
[1:29:36] [Applause]
[1:29:39] about but we got them in a ditch a
[1:29:41] formalism ditch an intellectual ditch
[1:29:45] right we got the word the word the word
[1:29:47] the word but where is the power of
[1:29:50] God and churches sit dead people sit
[1:29:53] dead but the word is being
[1:29:59] preached they had the word at
[1:30:03] Pentecost until the Spirit
[1:30:06] came they had the word brother they said
[1:30:09] go go up there in that upper room I
[1:30:13] guarantee you they prayed they read
[1:30:14] their Torah they did everything they
[1:30:16] needed to do they did the formalism but
[1:30:18] when the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:30:20] come but when the day of Pentecost was
[1:30:23] fully come they didn't cut it short on
[1:30:25] the eighth day brother Luther or the
[1:30:27] ninth day but on the 10th day when day
[1:30:30] 50 finally came around then the power of
[1:30:33] God came down and it come like a rushing
[1:30:36] Mighty Wind and let me tell you it
[1:30:37] changed their lives it changed their
[1:30:39] nature it changed their habits it
[1:30:42] changed their homes it changed their
[1:30:44] marriages oh Hallelujah it changed her
[1:30:47] children and if it did it for them let
[1:30:50] me tell you it'll do it for us
[1:31:03] so Pentecost is the standard yes and if
[1:31:07] Pentecost is the standard get your minds
[1:31:09] off of Aza right that's right if
[1:31:12] Pentecost is the standard then shouldn't
[1:31:14] we strive to uphold the
[1:31:19] standard shouldn't we strive as a
[1:31:22] Believer as a people as a home as a
[1:31:27] church as ministers as deacons as wives
[1:31:32] as husbands as musicians as people in
[1:31:35] the back doing the audio shouldn't we
[1:31:37] strive to uphold that standard when we
[1:31:40] walk out into the street as young people
[1:31:42] and Mom and Daddy ain't around that
[1:31:44] ain't the time to cut the skirts off and
[1:31:46] hack them up a little bit High that's
[1:31:48] the time to hold the standard young men
[1:31:51] this ain't the time when you walk out of
[1:31:53] the house and your pants get tighter and
[1:31:55] the jelly bracelets all over your wrist
[1:31:57] necklace hanging all over your neck this
[1:31:59] ain't the time for that this is the time
[1:32:01] to hold the standard God is looking for
[1:32:04] somebody to hold the standard let me
[1:32:07] tell you for me and my house we're going
[1:32:09] to hold the standard we're going to
[1:32:11] preach the word we're going to allow the
[1:32:13] spirit to move we're going to allow
[1:32:14] Pentecost to blow
[1:32:19] through and when we need to be corrected
[1:32:21] we're going to open oursel up for
[1:32:23] correction
[1:32:25] right so Pentecost is the standard We
[1:32:29] should strive with everything within us
[1:32:33] to achieve the
[1:32:35] standard to achieve it my There's No
[1:32:40] Greater Joy to KN it that you passed the
[1:32:45] test come on I know some of you are
[1:32:48] probably great intellectual Giants
[1:32:57] me neither
[1:32:59] Brother I did good enough just to get
[1:33:03] by but you know how it is when you're
[1:33:05] studying for that test man you're just
[1:33:08] studying laboring and laboring no matter
[1:33:10] how smart or unsmart you
[1:33:13] are shouldn't you you want to achieve to
[1:33:16] a passing
[1:33:18] grade I mean when I took test I look I
[1:33:21] wasn't a Believer but I called my
[1:33:22] grandma I said hey Granny got another
[1:33:26] test I need you to pray she was a
[1:33:27] believer of this message I wasn't and
[1:33:29] I'd pray I said look you need to pray
[1:33:31] for me I got a big test I was in college
[1:33:32] for accounting and yeah I passed I did
[1:33:34] all that I wasn't that
[1:33:37] dumb but I'll tell you it was her
[1:33:38] prayers I believe to help get me
[1:33:41] through but I was trying to achieve a
[1:33:44] passing grade now if we could put so
[1:33:46] much effort into achieving passing
[1:33:48] grades in college or passing certain or
[1:33:51] or certain things and and Milestones on
[1:33:53] the job to get a promotion shouldn't we
[1:33:55] be able to try and strive to achieve for
[1:33:58] Pentecost because Pentecost is the
[1:34:00] standard that's what God inspires what
[1:34:02] his church was at the beginning is what
[1:34:04] his church is going to be at the end and
[1:34:06] if that's what he expected and how he
[1:34:08] set his church up in the beginning let
[1:34:10] me tell you we should strive to be that
[1:34:12] church that kind of people with that
[1:34:15] kind of power that kind of authority not
[1:34:17] all beat down when the Devil comes in no
[1:34:20] you recognize I'm a Son of God you
[1:34:22] square your shoulders back and say not
[1:34:24] today Satan I'm a Son of God I'm a
[1:34:27] daughter of God I've been bought by the
[1:34:29] blood of Jesus Christ you're not coming
[1:34:30] in my home you're not coming against my
[1:34:33] marriage you can't have my children you
[1:34:35] can't have it take your hands off today
[1:34:38] that's what Pentecost is about church
[1:34:41] it's about taking the authority of the
[1:34:44] word of God and putting Satan to the
[1:34:47] [Applause]
[1:34:48] testall
[1:34:51] that's so what God did
[1:34:54] Pentecost he will
[1:34:57] do he will
[1:35:00] do in this church in the end he will do
[1:35:05] in the bride what he did in Paul's day
[1:35:08] is going to be reciprocated in bram's
[1:35:11] day in our day because he can't change
[1:35:15] now people want to say the apostolic age
[1:35:17] is
[1:35:19] over I hope y'all don't believe that
[1:35:21] here I knew better but
[1:35:25] I had to
[1:35:29] ask so what do you mean brother Joe
[1:35:31] Apostolic
[1:35:33] age you had to forgive me I left my
[1:35:35] handkerchief back in
[1:35:38] Louisiana so I'm gonna be soaking wet by
[1:35:40] the time I'm done but the apostolic age
[1:35:42] I look this up cuz I I'm Mississippi Boy
[1:35:46] oh well praise God you speak
[1:35:49] it hey man you got a check
[1:35:55] it weren't that good I might well keep
[1:35:58] asking when's a Pentecost will blow it
[1:36:01] in woo
[1:36:04] Glory no I'm not here for money I
[1:36:06] promise
[1:36:07] you but I wonder because I'm from
[1:36:10] Mississippi we're not very intelligent
[1:36:12] in Mississippi if you notice the 50th
[1:36:13] state in the continental United States
[1:36:16] 50 means the last
[1:36:17] number bottom of the barrel y'all get
[1:36:20] that all right so that's where I'm went
[1:36:22] from so anyway I want to know what
[1:36:24] what's it mean by Apostolic age it means
[1:36:26] relating to the seccession of Spiritual
[1:36:29] Authority they so God God gave his
[1:36:33] disciples he gave them the authority to
[1:36:36] use the word because God implanted
[1:36:38] inside of them a part of himself and men
[1:36:42] today want to claim and men in that day
[1:36:43] want to claim that the apostolic
[1:36:45] seccession The Authority by which God
[1:36:48] had given men to use the word to use the
[1:36:50] power to use the Holy Ghost is over that
[1:36:53] was only for the
[1:36:57] 12 they claimed that the works that the
[1:37:00] Holy Ghost did in the apostles is only
[1:37:02] for those in the book of
[1:37:05] Acts men today claim that the days of
[1:37:09] Miracles is
[1:37:11] over how many of you are saved and
[1:37:13] filled with the Holy Ghost then the days
[1:37:15] of Miracles is not over cuz you're the
[1:37:18] greatest Miracle you're the greatest
[1:37:22] miracle they want to claim ministers
[1:37:24] today around this message want to claim
[1:37:26] that we don't need the supernatural
[1:37:30] anymore some claim that we don't need
[1:37:33] any of that we got the revealed word I
[1:37:36] was in a youth meeting one time and we
[1:37:38] had a young sister come to the altar
[1:37:40] actually she come in a she was at a
[1:37:42] youth camp and something spoke to me and
[1:37:44] say she's got a spirit of suicide on her
[1:37:46] and I went and I told brother Timothy we
[1:37:48] was at a youth camp and I said this
[1:37:49] girl's got a spirit of suicide on he was
[1:37:51] begin to deal with her and he began
[1:37:53] prayed with her but she never exposed
[1:37:55] she never confessed it but something
[1:37:56] just spoke to me and so we dealt with
[1:37:59] her and you know she was okay but she
[1:38:00] the thing didn't get cast out and so a
[1:38:03] few months later she comes to our
[1:38:05] October meetings and there she comes
[1:38:06] into a prayer line and me and brother uh
[1:38:09] brother a and or working with this young
[1:38:10] girl and I knew what I saw some two
[1:38:13] months prior of that and the Lord's told
[1:38:15] me she's not delivered yet so we begin
[1:38:17] to talk to her I be to speak to her and
[1:38:19] the Lord begin to discern her heart and
[1:38:21] she crumbled brother Jason to her knees
[1:38:24] and she be to cry and scream out cuz she
[1:38:26] wanted deliverance and she ran to the
[1:38:29] Altar and she stayed there and cried and
[1:38:31] boohoo but old grandma came up there and
[1:38:34] said get a hold of yourself little girl
[1:38:36] we didn't do that when I was your
[1:38:39] age get a hold of yourself we didn't act
[1:38:43] like that when I was your
[1:38:44] age ask me where that young lady's at
[1:38:48] today she's out there in the
[1:38:51] world suffering cuz she had her
[1:38:53] opportunity and because somebody says
[1:38:56] well we didn't do that in my
[1:38:58] day well maybe it wasn't preached in
[1:39:00] power in your day maybe it wasn't
[1:39:03] preached in fullness in your day maybe
[1:39:05] because we didn't have all the message
[1:39:07] all in and the way we do today on the
[1:39:09] computer well you can search it all the
[1:39:10] way out all the way through in your day
[1:39:13] but we're not looking about your day
[1:39:15] what is he doing today and I believe the
[1:39:18] same Holy Ghost is still moving still
[1:39:20] Discerning still calling young people
[1:39:23] back to the altar so that they can give
[1:39:25] their heart to God and have a real
[1:39:27] Pentecostal
[1:39:31] experience notice Mark 16 verse1
[1:39:36] 17 if we had the restored word which we
[1:39:39] do then it comes with restored
[1:39:45] power and if we had the restored power
[1:39:48] that mean we don't sit it on a shelf and
[1:39:50] look at it we have the restored word we
[1:39:53] don't sit it on the Shelf just to have a
[1:39:55] collection of books or a collection of
[1:39:57] tapes or a collection of quotes got our
[1:40:00] little nugget book worried about your
[1:40:02] nugget book I'm worried about your soul
[1:40:05] I'm worried about your heart I'm where
[1:40:06] you
[1:40:07] living and if we got the restored word
[1:40:10] then there's got to be a restored power
[1:40:12] notice we find here in Mark 16 and
[1:40:14] verse1 17 these signs shall follow them
[1:40:19] that believe amen that was a weak amen
[1:40:23] from everybody but brother Luther back
[1:40:25] here or whoever's Amen to me I don't
[1:40:28] know these sign listen this ain't my
[1:40:31] word this ain't brother Jason's word
[1:40:33] this ain't this is not Paul's word or
[1:40:35] brother Brandon's word this is Jesus
[1:40:38] Christ saying these signs shall follow
[1:40:41] them that believe that's not up for
[1:40:44] debate I don't care where your theology
[1:40:47] come from the word of God is the
[1:40:49] finality it's the standard it's the th
[1:40:52] sayth the Lord Glory these signs will
[1:40:57] shall follow that ain't maybe that ain't
[1:41:00] hope so that ain't when you get this
[1:41:02] spiritual temperature of the church
[1:41:04] right that is the word of
[1:41:07] God but
[1:41:08] notice it only follows them that
[1:41:13] believe you can sit here in service
[1:41:16] everybody jumping around having a good
[1:41:18] time but you know you could be all sold
[1:41:22] up have a bad day choosing to not
[1:41:26] believe choosing to just say well it
[1:41:28] ain't for me never never for me I knew
[1:41:32] it to be like this I'd come in everybody
[1:41:34] shouting and dancing and I don't feel
[1:41:35] nothing I don't know what they feeling
[1:41:37] well if you just change your unbelief to
[1:41:40] believing if you can change your
[1:41:43] unbelief and start believing quit being
[1:41:46] a
[1:41:47] Critic being critical and say Lord help
[1:41:49] me believe help thou my unbelief turn my
[1:41:53] doubts into believing help me see what
[1:41:56] the word is doing in this
[1:41:58] hour notice these signs shall follow
[1:42:01] them that believe in my name they shall
[1:42:03] cast out Devils they shall speak in new
[1:42:06] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[1:42:08] I don't bring your snakes into the
[1:42:09] church this morning if they drink any
[1:42:12] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[1:42:15] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:42:17] shall recover nowhere does it say maybe
[1:42:21] nowhere does it say if nowhere does it
[1:42:25] say you got to do certain certain thing
[1:42:27] in order for the word to come in action
[1:42:29] it says if you shall believe if you can
[1:42:32] believe this morning the sick can be
[1:42:34] healed the dead can be raised blinded
[1:42:37] eyes can be open Hallelujah church
[1:42:39] that's the word of
[1:42:41] [Applause]
[1:42:44] God so we have our youth
[1:42:47] camp how many of you have ever dealt
[1:42:49] with a demon
[1:42:50] Spirit maybe a handful of you
[1:42:53] some of you probably never seen it but
[1:42:56] it's real so in prayer line first time I
[1:42:59] ever seen it manifest maybe second time
[1:43:02] one of our youth camps and I was not too
[1:43:04] far behind brother Timothy and brother
[1:43:07] Tim and I think it was brother Ron at
[1:43:08] this time and they become a sister in
[1:43:10] the line she was an older lady had
[1:43:12] children and she'd done been in prayer
[1:43:14] lines and prayer lines and been to
[1:43:15] different Brothers brothers that we
[1:43:17] holding high regard and seeking prayer
[1:43:19] seeking the answer seeking Deliverance
[1:43:22] when she came in when she she got to
[1:43:23] that prayer line she stopped and man she
[1:43:25] stopped right in front of me I'm
[1:43:28] like I knew what was going on like oh
[1:43:30] this thing's got a devil on
[1:43:32] her and brother Joy she started just
[1:43:35] doing
[1:43:35] this and her neck just head just like a
[1:43:39] snake just just very just bam boom just
[1:43:44] not saying nothing just real tight and
[1:43:46] just snaking back and
[1:43:48] forth so we begin to pray and I'm going
[1:43:50] tell you I'm a prayer
[1:43:54] I'm going to pray with everything I got
[1:43:56] and I ain't letting go until the thing
[1:43:58] leaves and I prayed and I prayed and I
[1:44:01] prayed and I prayed and this thing was
[1:44:03] stubborn I'm like God you going to have
[1:44:05] to do something cuz I'm running out of
[1:44:06] strength right but the words the word
[1:44:09] regardless of my Humanity right when
[1:44:12] brother Craig was there brother my
[1:44:13] brother Craig my brother-in-law brother
[1:44:15] Craig Boer he was there and so me and
[1:44:16] brother Craig begin to work with her and
[1:44:18] all of us when she kind of fell down on
[1:44:20] the platform and she come to herself for
[1:44:22] a minute and she looked at her husband
[1:44:24] because we were going to take her to the
[1:44:25] back room begin to work with her in the
[1:44:26] back room and she looked at her husband
[1:44:28] she goes they're going to give up on me
[1:44:29] like everybody else I said oh not today
[1:44:33] Satan me and brother Craig B went to
[1:44:35] that back room and we began to work and
[1:44:37] brother Craig began to put things
[1:44:38] together and begin to talk this and
[1:44:40] begin to deal with this and deal this
[1:44:41] and then we finally cracked the
[1:44:45] key finally cracked a key that released
[1:44:49] her from her prison amen Lord Amen
[1:44:53] brother Jason she would said every time
[1:44:55] she'd get to that point get to that
[1:44:57] point of almost Breaking Free she will
[1:45:01] saw
[1:45:03] herself saw herself and the word the
[1:45:06] brothers couldn't be around her because
[1:45:08] it was
[1:45:09] nasty oh but that night was
[1:45:12] different and she we begin to pray and
[1:45:15] we begin to brother Craig and I just
[1:45:17] begin to work with her he working on the
[1:45:19] like the the teaching type side of it
[1:45:21] and really connecting things me from the
[1:45:23] the the Evangelistic side and we just
[1:45:25] begin to work the two gifts hand in hand
[1:45:28] working there and we finally she got to
[1:45:30] the point where she lifted her hands and
[1:45:32] begin to worship God and she said it's
[1:45:35] different this
[1:45:36] time it's different this time she looked
[1:45:39] at her husband she said it didn't happen
[1:45:41] this time she goes I'm free now and she
[1:45:44] began to hear angels singing in another
[1:45:46] dimension and can I tell you she's still
[1:45:49] free today she's no longer bound she's
[1:45:52] no long but cuz the word of God has
[1:45:55] power that we have the authority Brother
[1:45:58] Brad to cast out Satan that's not up for
[1:46:01] debate that ain't up to have a
[1:46:03] discussion with the devil it's thus
[1:46:05] sayeth the Lord and if you're a Believer
[1:46:07] you can take that word and put it on
[1:46:09] your lips and it's just the same as
[1:46:12] deity he
[1:46:14] speaking we had another young girl I'll
[1:46:17] give you another quick testimony on
[1:46:19] it I won't hold you much longer

[1:46:25] years

[1:46:58] back and work with we don't want you in
[1:46:59] the back by yourself so we we go down
[1:47:00] and we begin to work with her and this
[1:47:02] young girl is just foaming at the mouth
[1:47:05] like a dog I mean foam just pouring all
[1:47:08] out of her mouth am I right and she's
[1:47:10] arching her back and just foam and just
[1:47:13] notd in herself we get her to come to
[1:47:14] herself for a minute and try to to work
[1:47:16] with her and try to get her to come to
[1:47:18] herself and I didn't know the situation
[1:47:20] where brother Matt McGary he she
[1:47:23] attended their Church well he comes to
[1:47:24] the back in just a few minutes he begin
[1:47:26] to work because he knows the history
[1:47:29] well he begins to tap into it brother
[1:47:31] Jason and begin to speak to the spirit
[1:47:33] with inside of her and within five
[1:47:35] minutes that young girl was free 45
[1:47:39] minutes we were back there working with
[1:47:41] her and when five minutes when you can
[1:47:43] hit the spot and realize you tap into it
[1:47:46] and get them to realize who they are
[1:47:48] when you're not speaking to the enemy
[1:47:50] anymore but you're speaking to the
[1:47:52] spirit within them and say do you want
[1:47:53] to be free yes I want to be free then
[1:47:56] through the your confession of Faith you
[1:47:58] can't stay bound let me tell you and
[1:48:00] he's the same today church we have the
[1:48:03] authority by the word of God that was
[1:48:06] deposited to us on the day of Pentecost
[1:48:09] to lay hands on the sick and to cast out
[1:48:12] devils and it worked then it works today
[1:48:15] it'll work tonight it'll work tomorrow
[1:48:18] it'll work next week it'll work every
[1:48:20] time it'll work
[1:48:24] GL John 14 we find here Jesus tells us
[1:48:28] John 14:11 believe me that I am in the
[1:48:31] father and the father in me or else
[1:48:33] believe me for the very work's sake
[1:48:35] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:48:37] believeth on me and the works that I do
[1:48:39] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[1:48:43] these shall he do because I go to the
[1:48:46] father so Jesus is telling us by the
[1:48:50] scripture that we can do Greater
[1:48:55] Works why ain't we doing
[1:48:58] it I ask you
[1:49:00] ministers why aren't we doing
[1:49:03] it do we not
[1:49:05] believe mom and dad why aren't we doing
[1:49:07] it do we not
[1:49:09] believe it's the
[1:49:11] word put it in practice
[1:49:14] yes so we find John
[1:49:17] 14 Jesus declaring that what he did and
[1:49:23] he divided himself up on the day of
[1:49:25] Pentecost the logos divided itself and
[1:49:28] came and lived in 120 and if it worked
[1:49:31] in his day through his life in his
[1:49:33] ministry won't it do the same today for
[1:49:38] us see the key to Mark 16 the key to
[1:49:42] John 14 is
[1:49:45] believing you can't have signs and
[1:49:47] wonders if you don't believe he said
[1:49:50] well my church don't have it well your
[1:49:51] church needs to start believing for
[1:49:54] it my pastor don't believe that way your
[1:49:56] pastor needs to start believing for it
[1:49:59] because the Bible says all things are
[1:50:01] possible to him that'll believe so we
[1:50:04] find in the book of Acts that what you
[1:50:07] essentially find in the book of Acts
[1:50:08] when you read through it you find Mark
[1:50:10] 16 and John 14 in action Amen in the
[1:50:14] book of Acts you find Mark 16 and John
[1:50:17] 14 in action they knew their position as
[1:50:21] sons of God and and if it worked in the
[1:50:23] Bible and we heard a prophet tell us if
[1:50:25] the vine ever puts forth another
[1:50:29] Branch oh it's going to be
[1:50:33] Baptist it's going to be Holiness it's
[1:50:36] going to be Oneness it's going to be no
[1:50:39] he says if that Bond ever puts forth
[1:50:42] another Branch it'll be another book of
[1:50:46] Acts let me tell you we're not acts part
[1:50:48] two we're the same continuation of the
[1:50:51] same manifestation of the same life and
[1:50:54] the same power that was in that CH group
[1:50:57] of Believers is the same power that's in
[1:50:59] this group of
[1:51:01] Believers cuz it's the same Winds of
[1:51:04] Pentecost they're still blowing they're
[1:51:06] still moving they're still operating in
[1:51:09] human
[1:51:11] lives so we find in the book of Acts men
[1:51:14] who actually believed and received the
[1:51:16] Life of Christ were actually producing
[1:51:18] The Works of
[1:51:20] God they were producing it the same
[1:51:23] works that Jesus did they did those that
[1:51:26] He breathed on into that day they were
[1:51:28] doing the same way bringing life to the
[1:51:30] people and see this is a
[1:51:33] promise it's a promise to us it didn't
[1:51:35] end God did not put an expiration date
[1:51:38] on Mark 16 right he didn't put an
[1:51:42] expiration date on John
[1:51:44] 14 he says this will I do these signs
[1:51:49] shall follow them can we keep going
[1:51:53] I'm going to try to bring this down I
[1:51:54] got about 20 minutes or
[1:51:58] more brother B said the Life of Christ
[1:52:01] returns in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:52:04] not a nail
[1:52:06] scar see the Corporal body is sitting at
[1:52:09] the right hand of God to make
[1:52:10] intercession but the Holy Ghost has come
[1:52:13] to carry on his work he that believeth
[1:52:16] in me and the works that I do shall he
[1:52:19] do also amen then we go to Malachi 3 and
[1:52:22] verse 6 says for I am the Lord I change
[1:52:27] not so if you don't get anything out of
[1:52:29] this message I want you to understand
[1:52:31] God does not change he is forever the
[1:52:34] same and if we can turn to our
[1:52:36] scriptures and see what he did then then
[1:52:38] we can expect him to do today sir amen
[1:52:42] so brother B would tell us here in
[1:52:44] Ephesians Church age he said what the
[1:52:46] church had at Pentecost is her
[1:52:48] inalienable right originally she had the
[1:52:51] pure word of God had the power of the
[1:52:53] spirit manifest in diverse signs and
[1:52:55] wonders and Gifts of the Holy Spirit he
[1:52:57] said and he goes into Hebrews 2 and
[1:52:59] verse one therefore we ought to give a
[1:53:01] more Earnest heed to the things which we
[1:53:03] have heard lest at any time we shall let
[1:53:05] them slip for if the words spoken by
[1:53:08] Angels was steadfast in every
[1:53:09] transgression and Disobedience to the
[1:53:11] word receive the just recompense of
[1:53:13] reward then how shall we escape if we
[1:53:16] neglect so great a Salvation which at
[1:53:18] first began to be spoken by the Lord and
[1:53:21] was confirmed To Us by them that heard
[1:53:23] it he said God also bearing them witness
[1:53:27] both with signs and wonders and with
[1:53:29] diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy
[1:53:31] Ghost according to his own word so if he
[1:53:35] beared them and he Vindicated them in
[1:53:38] their lives and their Ministries and
[1:53:40] their churches with signs and wonders
[1:53:43] then won't he vindicate the believer
[1:53:45] today with the same signs the same
[1:53:47] wonders the same outpouring of the
[1:53:49] supernatural
[1:53:52] and we find here in Jude Jude tells us
[1:53:54] to contend for the faith because they
[1:53:57] begin to slip away some 30 years after
[1:54:00] Paul established the Ephesian Church
[1:54:02] they begin to drift away and brother B
[1:54:05] said they had a less Ardent desire for
[1:54:07] the things of God that was just a 30
[1:54:10] years after their first messenger look
[1:54:13] how many years we are after the the last
[1:54:16] messenger you don't think there's a less
[1:54:18] hardened desire for this generation to
[1:54:21] believe the same signs and the same
[1:54:23] wonders when there's men out there
[1:54:24] propagating that God don't do these
[1:54:26] things anymore that we don't need altar
[1:54:28] calls that we don't need prayer lines
[1:54:30] that you don't have to have all that
[1:54:31] emotion you don't have to have all that
[1:54:33] dance they have strpped the power out of
[1:54:36] the
[1:54:39] church but see that's what Satan wants
[1:54:42] cold
[1:54:43] formalism intellectual gospel amen now
[1:54:47] I'm not against
[1:54:49] teaching I like it anointed though
[1:54:52] I don't want it dead that's right man
[1:54:55] hey look I can read for
[1:54:59] myself I don't want it dead I want it
[1:55:01] alive teach it put it together let it be
[1:55:05] inspired but what we have done we found
[1:55:07] men today because they feel this call in
[1:55:09] their life they going to teach because
[1:55:12] you ain't got to have no inspiration now
[1:55:14] let me let me back up on that they claim
[1:55:19] because they have no inspiration they're
[1:55:20] a teacher let me put it like that that
[1:55:22] well I'm a
[1:55:23] teacher but what have done what what has
[1:55:26] God done in your
[1:55:28] ministry there's
[1:55:31] nothing they ain't done
[1:55:33] nothing so you're a teacher you're part
[1:55:36] of that fivefold Ministry to establish
[1:55:39] the church to build her up to edify the
[1:55:42] body and you telling me God ain't doing
[1:55:44] nothing even in a Teaching Ministry no
[1:55:48] amen because God sent the fivefold for
[1:55:50] the perfecting of the church
[1:55:53] and that perfecting it means it's going
[1:55:54] to establish the believer in the present
[1:55:57] truth it's going to cut away things it's
[1:55:59] going to establish him on things it's
[1:56:00] going to do its part of the the body
[1:56:04] it's going to do its part of the
[1:56:06] ministry but we found we we've gotten so
[1:56:09] far away from Supernatural we're scared
[1:56:12] brother Jason some of us are so scared
[1:56:14] of the emotion come
[1:56:17] on we're scared of a little fire
[1:56:23] brother BR says and we all know this
[1:56:25] quote you can't get warmed by a painted
[1:56:28] fire look I tried it I we had a we was
[1:56:31] at a brother's house the other day and
[1:56:33] they had a little TV monitor excuse
[1:56:38] me Monitor and they had this picture of
[1:56:41] a fire it was crackling like oh
[1:56:44] my I didn't get one bit
[1:56:47] hotter I didn't get one bit colder man I
[1:56:50] felt like I was getting warmer like
[1:56:52] ain't nothing happening I heard the the
[1:56:55] crackle flames and I looked at my wife
[1:56:58] and said you can't get warmed by a
[1:56:59] painted
[1:57:01] fire and that's kind of what we've got
[1:57:03] in the ministry today a bunch of painted
[1:57:07] fires why not preach the same power why
[1:57:13] not preach the same anointing amen why
[1:57:17] not have the same Winds of Pentecost
[1:57:20] that blew in on that day why not welcome
[1:57:23] it today what about our service what
[1:57:26] about our youth what about our homes why
[1:57:28] can't we can't have
[1:57:30] it I tell my church don't paint me a
[1:57:33] fire throw that picture in the fire and
[1:57:36] let me get warmed by it I don't want
[1:57:39] some peny waste message I don't want
[1:57:42] some little Tick Tock real religion I
[1:57:45] want the power of God I want the Holy
[1:57:47] Ghost I want the anointing of Jesus
[1:57:49] Christ in the body in the church amongst
[1:57:52] a
[1:57:53] Believer I want it real if you ain't got
[1:57:56] it real then get out of here with
[1:58:00] it don't give me some theology give me
[1:58:05] neology give me something that's going
[1:58:07] to save my soul something's going to
[1:58:10] correct me in my spirit something's
[1:58:11] going to transform my
[1:58:17] body Ro Brown makes this statement he
[1:58:19] says we'll never find Jesus by going
[1:58:22] back to the beginning of baptism baptism
[1:58:25] or back to the beginning of methodism or
[1:58:28] Catholicism we only find Christ when we
[1:58:31] get back to Pentecostal beginning not
[1:58:34] the denomination now but the real
[1:58:36] Pentecostal
[1:58:38] experience he says we left him at
[1:58:41] Pentecost the Methodist left him at
[1:58:43] Pentecost the Baptist left him at
[1:58:45] Pentecost the Catholic left him at
[1:58:46] Pentecost the Amish left him at
[1:58:48] Pentecost the Brethren left him at
[1:58:50] Pentecost the assembly of God left them
[1:58:53] at Pentecost the United Church left them
[1:58:55] at Pentecost there's where he
[1:58:59] began and I'm afraid
[1:59:02] many many message churches have left
[1:59:06] him back in 63 at
[1:59:10] Pentecost because they were so
[1:59:12] determined not to be
[1:59:14] identified with that
[1:59:19] movement but see he can only put forth
[1:59:21] the new branch and it's going to be a
[1:59:23] Pentecostal
[1:59:25] branch and the only way to get inside
[1:59:27] the church brother Luther can't
[1:59:30] be the only way to say be born
[1:59:33] again got to be born again there's no
[1:59:36] substitutes amen either you die out or
[1:59:39] you don't die at all and you don't come
[1:59:41] in
[1:59:42] amen so we find we have to be born again
[1:59:46] it's essential to be born again in this
[1:59:49] hour and brother Brown said the only
[1:59:51] thing that is certain no matter where
[1:59:53] you put it he says if you're born again
[1:59:55] filled with the Holy Ghost he goes you
[1:59:57] might enough have enough Ashes to hold
[1:59:59] on your fingernail but you'll come up
[2:00:01] forth from the resurrection because you
[2:00:03] got life you've been endued with power
[2:00:05] from on high there's life in you there's
[2:00:08] a sound taking place a sound a certain
[2:00:10] sound that you know what happened you
[2:00:13] died and was born again and you become a
[2:00:16] new
[2:00:18] creation well you find people don't want
[2:00:20] to get ugly at the altar
[2:00:23] oh do
[2:00:25] we I don't nobody seeing me
[2:00:29] snot let me tell you I got a weak
[2:00:31] stomach
[2:00:33] folks I don't like seeing people
[2:00:36] snot but when they at this altar
[2:00:39] snotting something Thrills my soul yeah
[2:00:43] cuz I know it's real cuz you ain't
[2:00:44] snotting if it ain't

[2:01:01] Jason I was
[2:01:03] like I had to regain my composure I said
[2:01:05] she's doing this because God's dealing
[2:01:06] with
[2:01:09] her but we don't want to get ugly at the
[2:01:11] altar we want to be pretty we don't want
[2:01:15] to us guys we don't want to mess up our
[2:01:17] Johnson
[2:01:18] Murphy's we got to keep them all shiny

[2:01:24] that high did you I didn't
[2:01:26] either I'll feel that
[2:01:30] tomorrow but let's look at the
[2:01:32] characteristics as I begin to bring this
[2:01:34] down we're going to turn a corner and
[2:01:35] bring this
[2:01:36] home Psalms 146 and verse 5 says happy
[2:01:40] is he that ha the god of Jacob for his
[2:01:42] help whose hope is in the Lord his God
[2:01:45] which made Heaven and Earth and sea and
[2:01:46] all that therein is which keepeth truth
[2:01:48] forever which executeth judgment for the
[2:01:51] oppressed which giveth food to the
[2:01:53] hungry the Lord looses the
[2:01:56] prisoners and we dealt with young people
[2:01:58] last night about prison prison of
[2:02:01] depression and anxiety and fears and
[2:02:03] worries and guilts and pornography and
[2:02:05] passions and things of that nature but
[2:02:07] he says the Lord loosest the Prisoners
[2:02:09] the Lord openeth the eyes of the blind
[2:02:11] the Lord raises them that are bowed down
[2:02:14] the Lord loveth the righteous the Lord
[2:02:16] preserveth The Strangers he relieve the
[2:02:19] fatherless and Widow but the way of the
[2:02:21] wi wied he turneth upside
[2:02:24] down the Lord shall reign forever even
[2:02:28] thy God o Zion unto all generations
[2:02:31] praise ye the Lord so the
[2:02:34] characteristics of God is he is there to
[2:02:37] help you amen then we look here in
[2:02:39] Psalms 147 and verse three more
[2:02:42] characteristics he Health the broken in
[2:02:44] heart and bindeth up their wounds he tth
[2:02:47] the number of the stars and he calleth
[2:02:49] them by their name amen
[2:02:52] verse six the Lord lifted up the meek
[2:02:54] and he casteth the wick down to the
[2:02:59] ground in book of Acts three and verse
[2:03:02] one you don't have to turn there if
[2:03:03] you're on the monitor today but Peter
[2:03:05] heals a lame man in Acts three and an
[2:03:07] Nance of fire struck down in Acts 5
[2:03:11] Apostles performed many wonders in Acts
[2:03:13] 5:12 Peter and John uh dispersed Holy
[2:03:16] Ghost to different dividuals there in
[2:03:18] Acts 8 verse 14 and 17 Peter healed a
[2:03:21] man of py in Acts n Peter raises Tabitha
[2:03:25] and Dorcas to life in Acts nine we find
[2:03:28] Peter delivered out of the prison as we
[2:03:29] spoke about last night by the angel in
[2:03:32] Acts 12 God smites hering and he dies in
[2:03:34] Acts 12 and we find a sorcerer was
[2:03:37] smitten with blindness in Acts 13 then
[2:03:40] it goes into Paul so now we just went
[2:03:42] through Peter now let's look what
[2:03:44] happened in Paul's Ministry Paul was
[2:03:46] converted in Acts n Paul heals a
[2:03:49] in Acts 14 Paul cast out of the a Spirit
[2:03:51] of Divination in Acts 16 Paul and Silas
[2:03:55] prison doors open up when they begin to
[2:03:56] worship God in Acts 16 Paul again
[2:04:00] distributes the Holy Ghost to those in
[2:04:02] Corinth in Acts 19 Paul heals a
[2:04:04] multitude in Acts 19 Paul restores a man
[2:04:07] to life in Acts 20 Paul shakes off a
[2:04:09] Viper in Acts 28 Paul heals publicus and
[2:04:12] others in Acts 28 what did we see in
[2:04:15] Paul's Ministry was the very same thing
[2:04:17] we just saw in Peter's Ministry it's
[2:04:20] declaring that he is the the
[2:04:22] same and if Peter and Paul could do it
[2:04:25] what about Jesus in this day in this
[2:04:28] form in his body today he's the same
[2:04:31] church
[2:04:33] amen his characteristics do not change
[2:04:37] amen
[2:04:39] amen his characteristics brother bam
[2:04:42] says follow him his characteristics
[2:04:44] continually identify him the same as he
[2:04:47] was when he lived on earth he is still
[2:04:50] living here tonight in in the form of
[2:04:52] the Holy Ghost he ever lives and his
[2:04:55] characteristics follow him just as it
[2:04:57] always did he is still a
[2:05:01] living and he says the unusualness of
[2:05:04] God the character of God had to display
[2:05:06] his characteristics in the Supernatural
[2:05:09] to show that he identified himself on
[2:05:12] the message
[2:05:16] amen turn to Psalms you got those
[2:05:19] pictures who am I who's doing my did you
[2:05:22] say that I

[2:05:47] amen let's look at this brother brother
[2:05:50] Brown would say this in the message to
[2:05:51] token and I believe just what your
[2:05:53] Prophet said outside of the preaching of
[2:05:55] the Seven Seals the token is the most
[2:05:57] ordained message he's ever
[2:05:59] preached because it puts the life the
[2:06:02] literal Life of Christ back in Bride
[2:06:06] form the token life the token message
[2:06:09] and he says in the token he goes I am
[2:06:11] looking for a time of a Break Forth of
[2:06:14] the spirit of God in these last days
[2:06:16] that we're now living in come on can we
[2:06:19] believe that for our day for another

[2:06:30] believeing for a
[2:06:32] Rapture if you're believing for a

[2:06:35] another surge of the Holy Spirit another
[2:06:38] surge of the supernatural another surge
[2:06:40] of the power of God moving in the church
[2:06:44] to move her out of this Dimension and
[2:06:46] move her into another dimension into a
[2:06:49] Heavenly Dimension amen amen he said the

[2:09:40] terrible acts I will declare thy
[2:09:43] greatness they shall abundantly utter
[2:09:46] the memory of the great goodness and
[2:09:48] shall sing unto thy righteousness
[2:09:52] and we find today men today claim that
[2:09:55] we shouldn't tell
[2:10:00] testimonies that we should be we when we
[2:10:02] tell testimonies we're detracting from
[2:10:05] Brother
[2:10:08] [Music]
[2:10:11] BR God only did those things through a
[2:10:14] prophet n the Bible says these signs
[2:10:18] will
[2:10:18] follow not just the prophets
[2:10:21] not just the preachers not just the
[2:10:24] deacons but to them little mother little
[2:10:26] grandmother back here in the back it'll
[2:10:28] follow them that will believe and if I
[2:10:31] can get you to believe in this morning
[2:10:33] nothing shall be impossible and the
[2:10:35] Bible tells us oh I love what it says
[2:10:37] one generation come on grandparents

[2:11:00] moving on young people in young hearts
[2:11:03] in marriages in homes in families in
[2:11:05] situations in
[2:11:07] [Music]
[2:11:08] churches they say well we can't have the
[2:11:13] supernatural when you tell
[2:11:16] testimonies you're pointing people to
[2:11:18] yourself
[2:11:22] you're showing that you're some big
[2:11:30] preacher the greatest discredit that we
[2:11:34] can do to this message is to not testify
[2:11:38] what God has
[2:11:39] done I said the greatest
[2:11:42] discredit to say that God ceased doing
[2:11:45] what he did in brother bram's Day by
[2:11:46] opening up blind eyes and Healing The
[2:11:48] Sick and raising the dead and say that
[2:11:50] God ceased to be God at that point in
[2:11:55] 1965 we do a discredit to what we say is
[2:11:58] a message you got that picture yet
