[2:27] i'm going to
[2:29] be speaking this time
[2:32] on the fruit of the spirit in the bride
[2:34] tree
[2:37] ephesians 4 13 till we all come
[2:40] in the unity of the faith and of the
[2:42] knowledge of the son of god unto a
[2:44] perfect man unto the measure of the
[2:46] stature of the fullness of christ let's
[2:49] pray
[2:50] heavenly father we come before you now
[2:52] lord and we ask that your holy spirit
[2:54] would come
[2:55] and anoint your word
[2:57] lord and speak it forth to the hearts of
[2:59] your people we ask that you'd be
[3:01] glorified lord that that your name would
[3:03] be lifted up help us to step out of the
[3:05] way lord each one
[3:07] uh let the
[3:08] the worries and the cares of this life
[3:11] slip aside and and let your thoughts of
[3:14] you and of your word and of your glory
[3:18] come and take that place father
[3:20] we ask these things in jesus name amen
[3:23] bless you can be seated
[3:29] so here we see in ephesians 4 13 and
[3:32] we'll be talking
[3:33] more either later or next time
[3:36] about this scripture
[3:37] but this is a prophecy of the end time
[3:40] and the condition of
[3:43] that that god
[3:45] is going to bring
[3:47] in the end time
[3:49] church
[3:50] the truth the true church
[3:53] you know we understand there's a true
[3:54] true church and there's a false church
[3:58] there's a true vine and a false fine
[4:02] and so you know that's you look at at
[4:05] the
[4:06] seven churches in asia each one
[4:10] they have a rebuke
[4:12] and they have those who overcome
[4:15] right alongside each other and so
[4:18] it's clear from scripture
[4:19] jesus says the kingdom of heaven is like
[4:21] and unto and he goes and tells parables
[4:24] and he shows there is a true seed
[4:27] church and there's a false
[4:30] seed church there's
[4:31] there's the seed that was planted by the
[4:33] son of man and there's a seed that is
[4:36] sown by the devil
[4:38] the children of the kingdom
[4:40] and the children of the devil and it's
[4:42] both in the kingdom of heaven
[4:45] that kingdom of heaven is not
[4:47] up in the sky
[4:48] kingdom of heaven is the church
[4:52] kingdom heaven is in kingdom is in our
[4:54] midst is in the midst of us
[4:56] so there's a true seed and a false seed
[4:59] right
[5:00] and so in the true seed
[5:03] we see this in in the book of revelation
[5:05] in laodicean church age
[5:08] there's no commendation there's no
[5:10] nothing positive it just speaks of the
[5:12] overcomer
[5:13] right it's it's the worst age it's the
[5:16] darkest age
[5:17] we speak of the dark age
[5:19] and they got
[5:21] they got nothing on us in this age yes
[5:23] it was the dark age
[5:25] yes there was
[5:26] very little light
[5:28] on the word but today
[5:30] it's so deceiving it's the most
[5:32] deceitful age
[5:34] because satan impersonates himself
[5:37] as the church
[5:39] and so
[5:41] you see the church operating in the
[5:42] world today
[5:44] and what is it it's
[5:47] an impersonation
[5:49] you know we say well i know good people
[5:51] there okay it's this
[5:53] i do too
[5:55] it's nothing about that
[5:56] at all but it's about how satan is
[5:59] working in this staged age to deceive
[6:03] good people
[6:05] the primary place that he's working and
[6:08] using to deceive is america
[6:12] and it's through
[6:13] it's clear it's through american
[6:15] politics
[6:16] and it's it's the way that you see the
[6:19] charismatic and the baptist
[6:21] and all the churches you know you look
[6:23] at if you look in the grand scheme of
[6:25] things
[6:26] all the denominational churches today
[6:28] how many of them actually believe
[6:31] the bible is inspired
[6:33] hundred percent it's inspired of god
[6:37] it's it's getting to the place where
[6:38] very few you see the charismatic believe
[6:40] that assemblies of god
[6:42] united pentecostal believe that
[6:45] some baptist churches believe that but
[6:47] even now the southern southern
[6:50] southern baptist group they're
[6:52] they're now deciding to say well let's
[6:54] let women preachers
[6:56] in that's always the first
[6:59] step
[7:00] look at the other
[7:01] mainline denominations
[7:03] lutheran methodist each of them
[7:06] their first step at falling
[7:09] well before women preachers was the the
[7:13] the lack of holiness amongst the sisters
[7:16] because the church
[7:18] always
[7:20] if you look at the condition of the
[7:21] sisters in the church the women in the
[7:23] church that's going to be the condition
[7:24] of the church
[7:26] so if if you watch
[7:29] each of these denominational programs
[7:31] they were dead when they denominated but
[7:33] then they went through a process
[7:36] of cascading into total liberalism
[7:40] you know and and you see the the
[7:42] lutheran church the presbyterian the
[7:44] methodists the episcopalian these
[7:46] different
[7:47] denominations and this the first
[7:50] doctrinal step that they make is women
[7:52] can be in the pulpit
[7:54] then the next thing is
[7:56] uh is homosexuality really all that bad
[7:59] they're nice people
[8:01] it's okay and so this whole process
[8:04] of descending into
[8:06] not accepting the bible as the absolute
[8:09] as your final authority now accepting
[8:11] logic reason and every other thing
[8:13] besides
[8:14] basically culture becomes your absolute
[8:17] in these churches
[8:19] this is the process that's happening
[8:20] that's over there then you go over here
[8:23] into the churches that
[8:24] believe the bible and what do you see in
[8:27] america they're all under the influence
[8:30] of politics
[8:32] all their leaders franklin graham and
[8:35] and
[8:36] um
[8:37] all of them
[8:38] what are they what are they leaning
[8:40] towards what are they what is their hope
[8:41] in
[8:42] some great politician coming
[8:45] and restoring america
[8:48] to something great
[8:50] i'm talking about the condition of the
[8:51] false church and why it's the false
[8:53] church
[8:55] message believers shouldn't be deceived
[8:57] into this political movement
[9:00] it's not it's a political movement
[9:03] connected to church
[9:05] what was the problem at nicaea and
[9:07] before nicaea it was the connection of
[9:10] the church into politics
[9:12] what's the problem in our day with the
[9:15] pentecostals and the charismatics
[9:18] their connection into politics they're
[9:21] deceived
[9:23] they're deceived their message is from
[9:25] satan
[9:26] satan impersonating himself through the
[9:28] church good people
[9:31] nice people maybe even many of the
[9:32] preachers had started out with a good
[9:35] motivation
[9:36] now they got 20 000 members and their
[9:38] budget is 35 million dollars a year
[9:42] and you know money's just money but it's
[9:44] what what's in your heart and what's
[9:45] your attitude all these church
[9:48] they take they they spend 15 minutes
[9:51] preaching uh about tithing and offerings
[9:54] every service
[9:56] and they take their offering if it's not
[9:57] enough maybe sometimes they'll take
[9:58] another one
[10:01] didn't meet our budget we need a million
[10:03] every week
[10:05] and so it's insa it's insanity and we
[10:07] look and say
[10:08] my could the message is the message true
[10:11] people are wondering if the message is
[10:13] true goodness sakes
[10:15] what are you looking at out there
[10:17] how blind and deceived can you be
[10:20] yes there's problems amongst the message
[10:23] movement absolutely but look at the
[10:25] bible and look at the messenger and what
[10:28] message he brought
[10:30] don't look at the message movement
[10:31] there's lots of problems
[10:33] there's been there's been lots of
[10:34] problems there's been cults clans all
[10:37] these things but what are we looking at
[10:39] is the true
[10:41] church the true bride of christ that
[10:44] follows every word
[10:46] in this bible
[10:48] don't be afraid of the bible
[10:50] the people are afraid of it
[10:53] they say they don't their creed says
[10:55] they're not afraid of it but they are
[10:57] because when they're confronted with it
[10:58] they don't know what to do and they say
[11:00] it don't matter anymore
[11:02] suddenly it matters on your creed but
[11:05] now when you're confronted with the word
[11:06] what the word actually says
[11:09] oh no
[11:10] that don't matter
[11:12] we're all christians we're just all
[11:14] believers see that ecumenical spirit
[11:16] when confronted with the word you can't
[11:18] say amen he says we're all christians
[11:21] we're all one oh
[11:24] okay
[11:26] we see where we're going but to the true
[11:29] elected bride
[11:31] this is the promise till we all
[11:33] come in the unity of the faith you say
[11:35] how's it going to come
[11:37] not by the works of man
[11:39] not by the works of the flesh not by us
[11:43] organizing ourselves together
[11:45] each of us as individuals being faithful
[11:48] to the one that's called us
[11:50] and letting him work out the details he
[11:53] will work out the details because he
[11:54] promised that he would do it
[11:57] anything else when whenever we try to
[11:59] work out the details of this unity that
[12:02] becomes an ecumenical spirit and you've
[12:04] denominated
[12:06] no
[12:06] it's about you being faithful to christ
[12:08] regardless what anybody else does around
[12:10] you
[12:11] then you'll be unified with real
[12:13] believers
[12:15] till we all come in the unity of the
[12:16] faith
[12:17] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[12:20] unto a perfect man so a completed mature
[12:25] man under the measure of the stature of
[12:27] the fullness of christ this is what
[12:30] the true church is going to come to
[12:33] the true bride of christ is going to
[12:35] come to before the rapture takes place
[12:39] and god has sent a message
[12:41] and that's what he's doing in us
[12:43] you say i don't see it i don't feel it
[12:45] shut up devil
[12:47] i'm not talking to you
[12:49] talking to that devil that's talking to
[12:51] you
[12:52] but the circumstances around the message
[12:54] it couldn't be
[12:56] shut up devil
[12:58] i'm not talking to you
[13:00] we don't want to hear that nonsense
[13:02] get behind me satan this is a prophecy
[13:06] of the word of god and every word will
[13:08] come to pass
[13:10] not on the way we organize ourselves
[13:12] together
[13:13] but on the way we surrender to him and
[13:16] let him have his way
[13:19] the prophet says and anointed ones at
[13:21] the end times
[13:22] to see the fruit of the spirit
[13:25] in the last days and the bride tree
[13:28] ripening in the top of the time i
[13:30] believe that's
[13:31] an exact answer to this scripture
[13:35] there's going to be a ripening that's
[13:36] that's a maturing
[13:38] getting to the place where we're ready
[13:40] to be picked right
[13:43] we're not talking about ripening in the
[13:45] warehouse
[13:47] the lord wants tree-ripened fruit the
[13:51] real deal
[13:52] genuine
[13:54] not using gases and lights and so forth
[13:57] but the real genuine ripening that comes
[14:00] from being on a tree
[14:03] and then he's going to harvest harvest
[14:05] us take us in the rapture
[14:06] but we've received the word
[14:09] today
[14:10] that's going to ripen us
[14:12] it's all the message we don't need to
[14:14] add to it but we need to follow what's
[14:16] are in it
[14:17] not what we think's in it but it's
[14:19] actually there
[14:21] all right
[14:22] so let's look at the fruit of the spirit
[14:25] and of course we understand as we we go
[14:27] along this and we'll look at some quotes
[14:29] the fruit of the spirit is not the
[14:30] evidence of receiving the holy ghost
[14:33] it can be mimicked but
[14:35] it's the fruit of the spirit in other
[14:37] words if you have the holy ghost it will
[14:39] produce this
[14:40] but you can also mimic these things
[14:44] using human characteristics the prophet
[14:46] clearly clearly says that we're not to
[14:49] get this out of order and say well i
[14:51] have the fruit of the spirit therefore i
[14:53] have the spirit no
[14:55] no
[14:55] we receive the word
[14:57] and then that word lives in us and
[14:59] produces
[15:01] the fruit of the spirit you see that
[15:02] fine line
[15:04] it's important not to get it out of the
[15:05] way if you get it out of the way you
[15:07] know brother branham says
[15:09] i learned it wasn't love
[15:10] i learned it wasn't the fruits that was
[15:12] the evidence it wasn't tongues
[15:14] but it was receiving the word for your
[15:16] age
[15:18] and then immediately any time he says
[15:19] that he says immediately says and then
[15:22] that word lives in you
[15:24] so it's not as though he's saying well
[15:27] it's just receiving the word and you can
[15:28] be any kind of rotten person
[15:30] no
[15:32] it's just it's just getting in its right
[15:34] proper position
[15:36] receiving the word
[15:39] for your age is what br is what is the
[15:42] evidence of the holy ghost but when you
[15:44] do that it produces something in your
[15:46] life the same works that christ did
[15:52] amen this i say then galatians 5 16 this
[15:56] i say then
[15:57] walk in the spirit
[15:59] and you shall not fulfill
[16:02] the lust of the flesh
[16:05] so this is this is paul
[16:07] speaking to the galatians
[16:09] and the galatians main trouble is they
[16:11] received the gospel they received the
[16:13] holy spirit
[16:14] by faith
[16:15] by by the hearing of the word is what
[16:18] the apostle says
[16:19] they heard that word preached
[16:22] they believed it and the holy spirit
[16:24] fell upon them
[16:25] just just like cornelius did
[16:28] while peter was yet speaking the holy
[16:30] spirit fell fell on them
[16:33] so paul's saying okay
[16:35] you you start you started out you
[16:37] received it right now false teachers
[16:39] came and you listened and you thought
[16:42] okay i need to have the law
[16:45] i need to follow the law you got it out
[16:47] of order
[16:50] walk in the spirit and you won't fulfill
[16:53] the lusts of the flesh
[16:55] it's not the other way around if you
[16:57] don't fulfill the lust of the flesh then
[16:59] you're walking in the spirit
[17:01] no it's not how it works
[17:03] it's not
[17:04] just as brother we talked about with
[17:06] brother branham it's not
[17:08] have the fruit of the spirit and then
[17:09] you'll receive the word of your age it's
[17:11] received the word of your age
[17:13] then the fruit of the spirit will follow
[17:16] so the galatians have turned away from
[17:18] the simplicity of the word
[17:21] back to the law
[17:24] right so they looked at this as a
[17:27] grouping
[17:28] of rules
[17:29] regulations of course they were
[17:30] christians but they said they said you
[17:33] know what we need to be circumcised
[17:35] we need to follow these commandments
[17:39] in order to rece be heirs of the
[17:41] covenants of promise that's what the
[17:43] false teachers were bringing to them
[17:45] they weren't bringing they weren't
[17:46] saying don't believe the gospel no
[17:48] they were saying believe the gospel but
[17:50] first
[17:51] you have in order to believe the gospel
[17:54] and to receive these promises
[17:56] you have to follow the law
[17:59] you have to get circumcised you have to
[18:01] do this you have to do the list of rules
[18:03] now you're a message believer
[18:06] it's not following the list of rules
[18:10] and then you know you believe the word
[18:13] and then that word lives inside of you
[18:15] producing
[18:17] the the works
[18:19] it's it any any look at any false cults
[18:23] and clans
[18:24] many of them teach modesty right
[18:28] and and and things
[18:30] even beyond what we're doing
[18:32] i don't mean they have the fruit of the
[18:34] spirit
[18:36] they're just following a religion you
[18:38] can turn anything into a religion people
[18:40] have turned this message into a religion
[18:42] and they uses it as stick to beat people
[18:44] over the head with
[18:46] that's not what the message is it's
[18:48] received the word
[18:49] and when you receive that word
[18:52] that word lives
[18:54] right and it convicts you of sin and we
[18:57] preach against sin and that word meets
[18:59] the word and you come into obedience to
[19:01] it
[19:02] but it's not about controlling
[19:04] manipulating forcing
[19:07] that's what the that's what the false
[19:08] teachers to galatia
[19:10] we're bringing we're bringing
[19:12] outward obedience leads to covenant
[19:14] blessings
[19:16] that's not the new covenant it's not
[19:18] what paul preached
[19:20] that's false teaching
[19:21] isn't it amazing that's the same kind of
[19:23] thing
[19:24] had come into the message
[19:29] let's look at this quote from is your
[19:31] life worthy of the gospel
[19:33] when this takes place the thing you'll
[19:35] do then you'll find out that the spirit
[19:38] that comes into you from the new birth
[19:40] you will believe and do everything that
[19:42] god says in his word for is for you to
[19:45] do
[19:46] everything that the bible quotes for you
[19:47] to do you'll punctuate it with an amen
[19:50] amen and you'll not stop day and night
[19:52] until you receive it that's right that's
[19:54] right and in all this time you'll
[19:56] certainly above everything
[19:58] bear the fruit of the spirit amen
[20:02] you know
[20:03] paul writes and i i can't even recall
[20:06] where he writes it but he tells them i
[20:07] don't have any need
[20:09] to teach you about brotherly love
[20:12] for the spirit
[20:14] teaches you
[20:15] in other words these things come we bear
[20:17] this automatic
[20:19] now again again don't don't get it don't
[20:23] don't get super spiritual on me here
[20:25] understand that if you're a babe in
[20:27] christ you do things that a babe in
[20:29] christ does
[20:31] there's a process
[20:32] when i received the holy spirit
[20:35] i had so many bad habits in my life
[20:38] they didn't instantly drop off the
[20:40] desire changed
[20:42] and then little by little i overcome one
[20:45] step i overcome another step i overcome
[20:47] another step and the whole thing was the
[20:49] grace of god working in me to sanctify
[20:51] my life
[20:53] but this
[20:54] if i would have just done all those
[20:55] things without the holy spirit it's
[20:57] worthless it's meaningless
[20:59] the spirit of god came to me when i
[21:02] received the word
[21:04] in in the portion that i received it the
[21:06] spirit of god came to me and he cleansed
[21:07] started cleansing me
[21:09] i got rid of swearing i got rid of rap
[21:11] music i got rid of drinking
[21:13] step by step all these things fell off
[21:16] because it was god working in me no one
[21:17] was forcing me to do that
[21:20] no one was pushing me said you must do
[21:22] that even when i came eventually came to
[21:24] a message church and first services i
[21:26] came i was wearing shorts
[21:28] this is what i knew nobody said anything
[21:30] but i fed on the word and what happened
[21:32] we're feeding on the word immediately i
[21:34] listened to satan's eden i tell my
[21:36] friend let's pause that i throw out my
[21:38] shorts come back and finish listening
[21:41] no one told me to do that no one forced
[21:42] me to do that just listening to the word
[21:46] and i said amen i punctuated with an
[21:48] amen and i did it
[21:51] and so we don't have to force one
[21:52] another to obey the word
[21:55] we we want each one to receive the holy
[21:58] spirit of course as parents we teach we
[22:00] train we hold accountable not saying
[22:02] anything against that but understand is
[22:05] your kids
[22:06] are living under your influence that's
[22:08] different than living
[22:10] full of the holy ghost point them to
[22:13] christ
[22:14] and receiving christ in your heart by
[22:16] the baptism of the holy ghost
[22:18] then that word can truly live in them
[22:20] but train them teach them we we have to
[22:22] have training too
[22:24] you know my training come after i
[22:26] received the holy spirit i wish it would
[22:28] have come before
[22:29] a little bit came before
[22:31] it would have been an easier life for me
[22:35] easier things to recover myself from
[22:37] but god's grace is sufficient regardless
[22:39] of what it is
[22:42] amen so
[22:44] galatians 5 17 for the flesh lust
[22:46] against the spirit
[22:49] and the spirit against the flesh
[22:52] and these are contrary the one to the
[22:54] other so that you cannot do the things
[22:57] that you would so paul is speaking
[23:00] again to born-again people
[23:03] he's not speaking to people who are
[23:04] unsaved speaking he's writing to the
[23:07] saints in galatia
[23:09] so this is you as a believer
[23:12] the flesh lusts against the spirit what
[23:15] is lust in this word means to set the
[23:17] heart upon
[23:19] so the
[23:21] flesh
[23:22] sets the heart against the spirit and
[23:25] the spirit sets the heart against the
[23:28] flesh
[23:30] right
[23:30] so the holy spirit in us will set
[23:33] our heart against the works of the flesh
[23:37] they're contrary to another
[23:39] the works of the spirit the fruit of the
[23:40] spirit is contrary to the works of the
[23:43] flesh
[23:45] they fight one another inside of us
[23:49] right
[23:50] you angels out there as the brother said
[23:52] the other night they
[23:55] we're not angels we're facing a battle
[23:57] inside of ourselves
[24:00] the flesh fighting against the spirit
[24:03] the spirit wants to work in our hearts
[24:05] so that from that control tower
[24:08] we're walking in obedience and
[24:10] submission to the word
[24:13] the flesh is
[24:15] warring against that and saying
[24:17] no no take the easy route take the easy
[24:20] way
[24:20] do the things that you want to do follow
[24:22] your dreams
[24:24] it's deceitful it's deceiving this two
[24:27] natures at war against us against each
[24:29] other
[24:30] inside of us that's why we're
[24:32] that's why we're our worst enemy
[24:34] is that that flesh that's warring
[24:36] against the spirit
[24:38] but what do we do we have to bring it
[24:39] under submission that's why paul said i
[24:42] die daily
[24:45] and he didn't literally go through death
[24:46] every day and get resurrected and then
[24:49] he woke up for the day no he he had to
[24:52] die to the flesh
[24:54] to the desires of the flesh that were
[24:56] lusting against the spirit that were
[24:58] setting his heart against the spirit
[25:02] and that sinful nature within us doesn't
[25:05] evaporate or vanish until we get a new
[25:08] body
[25:10] when we have that new body then it's
[25:11] gone then it's finished until then we
[25:14] have a war on our hands
[25:16] and that's what the christian walk is
[25:18] it's a war
[25:22] but if you be led
[25:24] of the spirit ye are not
[25:27] under the law
[25:29] well it depends on what your concept of
[25:32] being led of the spirit is
[25:34] there's a lot of real religious people
[25:36] that think being being led of the spirit
[25:39] is being under under the submission of a
[25:42] domineering pastor
[25:43] that's not being led to the spirit
[25:46] that's just being under nicolaitanism
[25:49] well there's a lot of people that being
[25:50] led of the spirit thinks i can just do
[25:53] anything i want to without checking with
[25:55] god about it
[25:58] now that's following your own wicked
[26:00] heart
[26:02] being led by the spirit anytime you're
[26:03] led by the spirit we know the leading
[26:05] will never contradict the word
[26:08] always lead according to the word that's
[26:09] why brother branham said if one when the
[26:11] angel of the lord comes to me
[26:13] uh i check it by the bible
[26:16] right
[26:17] he would hear he would listen then he
[26:19] would go from genesis to revelation to
[26:21] check it by the bible why because that's
[26:23] a that's an angel a spirit from god
[26:26] coming to speak to him and he knows it
[26:27] has to be by the word
[26:30] and then the people say if the angel of
[26:31] the lord told you brother branham that
[26:32] water baptism was acts 2 38 will do it
[26:35] so if the angel lord said anything else
[26:37] it wouldn't be an angel from god
[26:40] the angels
[26:41] everyone must be subject to the word
[26:46] being led by the spirit is not being led
[26:48] by emotions
[26:50] people are led by emotions they're
[26:52] they're
[26:53] one day they're going one direction the
[26:54] next day they're going another direction
[26:56] why because they're following their
[26:58] emotions
[26:59] and not the spirit the spirit leads you
[27:02] consistently sometimes it's strange
[27:04] it can be strange to those looking from
[27:06] the outside
[27:07] right that doesn't mean that doesn't
[27:08] mean it is it isn't come like that
[27:12] sometimes your leadings are strange but
[27:13] your leadings are always according to
[27:15] the word
[27:18] and it's an individual leading
[27:21] that individual leading will
[27:24] lead you to the unity of the faith right
[27:27] it's not going to make you an island to
[27:29] yourself and i don't go to church and i
[27:30] don't do this i stay home and listen to
[27:32] tapes
[27:33] i stay home and streaming no it brings
[27:35] you in
[27:36] unity of the faith not by a force
[27:39] but it's it's something that god is
[27:41] working in you
[27:43] to bring you into into communion in the
[27:46] holy ghost together with other believers
[27:51] and being led by the spirit is going to
[27:54] look like
[27:55] the fruit of the spirit
[27:57] is coming forth in your life
[27:59] love joy peace patience
[28:02] kindness goodness
[28:04] gentleness not the works of the flesh
[28:08] and so paul here is trying to emphasize
[28:11] to them in this is if you're being led
[28:14] by the holy ghost if you have if you've
[28:16] been if you receive the spirit of god in
[28:17] your life
[28:18] you've been changed you've been
[28:20] transformed you don't need to be under
[28:23] the law because that spirit in in you is
[28:26] going to bring you and write that word
[28:28] on your heart so that you live
[28:31] what the law says
[28:33] what the ten commandments say
[28:35] you're
[28:36] you become a written epistle of god
[28:39] because he's writing his word in your
[28:42] heart and then you obey the word what is
[28:44] the new covenant
[28:46] what is the new covenant it's not oh the
[28:49] law is thrown in the trash bin
[28:51] no it's he's taking that law
[28:55] and writing it on your heart
[28:58] right
[28:59] he's circumcising your heart
[29:01] it's not
[29:02] the spirit of god is not going to lead
[29:04] you contrary to the word
[29:06] it's going to lead you directly into
[29:08] obedience of the word
[29:12] our flesh we cannot keep
[29:14] the ten commandments the bible
[29:18] time and time again shows us the truth
[29:20] of that
[29:23] only thing that the ten commandments
[29:24] does to this flesh is put us in
[29:27] bondage and send us to hell
[29:30] but the holy spirit
[29:33] comes
[29:35] you know the law is just a school master
[29:36] right to lead us to christ
[29:39] it's to point us on the road
[29:42] what was intended paul says what was
[29:44] intended to bring life only brings death
[29:47] to us
[29:48] that's the law not because there's a
[29:50] problem with the law it's because
[29:52] there's a problem with us
[29:55] we have a sin we're born with a sinful
[29:56] nature and we always do the things that
[29:59] are displeasing to the lord
[30:01] but when you receive the holy ghost that
[30:03] brings it that brings a new desire
[30:06] and a new direction in your life and it
[30:09] leads you into obedience to the word
[30:13] not because you feel forced you feel
[30:15] like it's a duty
[30:16] no you feel like it's a a joy it's a
[30:18] delight
[30:20] to you you and you and you you love it
[30:22] it's diff many times it's difficult and
[30:25] we have to die to our flesh
[30:28] but really that inside on the inside man
[30:31] is rejoicing in in walking in obedience
[30:34] to the word
[30:35] all right let's close
[30:37] you'd stand
[30:45] heavenly father we're so thankful that
[30:48] we know that when the spirit of truth is
[30:50] come into our hearts
[30:52] you guide us into all truth
[30:56] lord and you show us
[30:58] the things that are to come
[31:01] lord and you give us ears to hear and
[31:03] eyes to see
[31:06] the invisible things lord that are
[31:08] hidden
[31:09] from the world
[31:11] lord and and out of that we become
[31:14] that living word that's your purpose
[31:17] not just to hear it
[31:19] though we draw rejoice over hearing it
[31:21] and we love hearing it but lord it's
[31:24] becoming it
[31:26] becoming
[31:27] a living epistle read and known of all
[31:30] men
[31:31] help us to be that lord
[31:32] cleanse our hearts and minds
[31:34] be glorified in us lord bless the
[31:37] worship lord may our hearts be centered
[31:39] upon you
[31:40] bless the preaching of the word may you
[31:42] be glorified we ask in jesus christ's
[31:44] name
[31:45] amen
[32:17] [Music]
[32:39] [Music]
[32:51] [Music]
[33:00] you
