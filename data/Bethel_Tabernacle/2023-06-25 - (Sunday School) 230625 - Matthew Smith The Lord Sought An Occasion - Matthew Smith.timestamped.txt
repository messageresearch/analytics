[0:00] horrified that here's their young son is
[0:03] trying to marry this Philistine girl
[0:06] and
[0:08] the you know and as The Story Goes he
[0:11] goes he marries her and then at the at
[0:13] the wedding he has this there's the uh
[0:15] he has this riddle right because on the
[0:17] way to to get her he um kills this lion
[0:19] he has this riddle and there's a oh he
[0:21] makes a bet with all these the guys at
[0:23] the wedding and um
[0:25] uh they went that they they couldn't
[0:27] figure out his riddle and then he goes
[0:29] and
[0:30] um they couldn't figure it out so they
[0:32] went to his newlywed
[0:34] her to tell her the answer to the riddle
[0:37] so they can win the bet
[0:38] and
[0:40] he realizes that's what happens when
[0:42] they come and tell him to answer the
[0:43] riddle and so then he gets all mad and
[0:45] he says well if you hadn't been you know
[0:48] talking to my wife then you never would
[0:49] have figured it out and so then he
[0:51] leaves for like a year
[0:52] and then he comes back later and she's
[0:55] married off of somebody else
[0:57] and then he's asked her dad what's why
[1:00] did you marry my wife off and he says
[1:02] well I thought you hated her because she
[1:03] gave away your riddle right because I
[1:06] mean and it sounds like well who cares
[1:07] about a riddle well it was because there
[1:08] was a lot of money involved right
[1:10] usually that's why people that's usually
[1:12] why people get upset about that kind of
[1:14] stuff
[1:15] and so
[1:17] and so then his his marriage blows up
[1:19] and now she's married to somebody else
[1:22] and
[1:23] he he gets all upset and he goes and
[1:26] burns down a bunch of
[1:28] uh Philistine Fields goes in and sets
[1:32] all their crops on fire
[1:34] it's like
[1:36] this is a kind of a crazy story of a guy
[1:39] who's mad about his marriage going south
[1:41] and so as to burn everyone's crops down
[1:43] well it's because the Lord had sought an
[1:45] occasion against the Philistines yeah
[1:47] right so it's like you know from the
[1:49] outside perspective you you see this guy
[1:51] who's
[1:52] has this crazy almost like a psychotic
[1:55] break and and goes on a rampage and it's
[1:59] well it's because and it's all stemming
[2:01] from the fact that he was getting
[2:02] involved in a relationship that he
[2:03] shouldn't have got involved with in the
[2:04] first place but what he didn't realize
[2:06] and what nobody really realized is that
[2:08] the Lord was orchestrating that
[2:10] because he knew
[2:13] down the road that if Samson got
[2:15] involved in this in this relationship
[2:16] that was going to go bad
[2:18] it would cause him to become a deliverer
[2:22] for the people
[2:24] right it would start to to break the
[2:26] bondage of the Philistines on the people
[2:31] and I see this as so many times in in
[2:34] our lives the you know we'll go through
[2:36] stuff especially you know maybe before
[2:38] you're a Christian you have different
[2:40] things that you struggled with and the
[2:41] Lord delivers you for delivers you from
[2:42] it or maybe maybe just throughout your
[2:44] Christian experience you have all these
[2:46] things that
[2:47] maybe you should have known better maybe
[2:49] you you know and it feels like the Lord
[2:51] lets you
[2:53] go do stuff that you really shouldn't
[2:55] have done
[2:57] you know I mean the footsteps of the
[2:58] righteous are ordered of the Lord so
[3:00] does that mean that that's not true when
[3:02] you're walking off into some bear trap
[3:06] you know when when the you know it's
[3:11] it's funny there's the I saw a I was a
[3:14] comic strip one time and it's a guy and
[3:16] he's walking around going look he looks
[3:17] at a bear trap and he's like I can't
[3:19] believe Bears get get you know don't see
[3:22] this trap and he sees a mousetrap and
[3:23] says you know I can't believe that
[3:27] uh uh you know people wouldn't people
[3:29] wouldn't your mouse wouldn't notice that
[3:32] this is a trap and then you know it's
[3:34] you know some some whatever it is
[3:38] whatever you know some money scam or
[3:40] whatever obvious scam that he gets
[3:42] involved in how could I have known
[3:44] it's like well yeah it's because
[3:46] you know it's it's a trap that so A lot
[3:48] of times we'll walk right into the Trap
[3:50] Of The Devil and the Lord will let us do
[3:52] it
[3:53] and you get hung up and you get a bunch
[3:55] of you in it with a bunch of scars
[3:57] because of it and the Lord let you do it
[4:00] and the reason is because he had an
[4:02] occasion against the devil
[4:04] he knew that in a year's time
[4:08] you're now going to have the motivation
[4:11] to pray about something that you
[4:13] wouldn't have had before
[4:15] when you when somebody else comes along
[4:19] who walked into the same trap you can
[4:21] now properly enter into the feeling of
[4:23] their infirmity
[4:24] because you have an occasion against the
[4:27] devil right
[4:29] I know throughout my life I've you know
[4:31] had various struggles various hardships
[4:33] things that I didn't understand
[4:36] how it was you know you know especially
[4:39] when you're a new Christian you think
[4:40] man Lord why did I have to go through
[4:43] that why did I have to struggle with all
[4:45] these issues
[4:47] you know well it's because now when when
[4:50] I have people that I care about
[4:54] or just anybody that you know they come
[4:56] to me saying that they have the same
[4:58] issue
[4:59] well for me it's not I have an occasion
[5:02] against that particular devil right I
[5:05] don't feel like
[5:07] you know especially when I was a
[5:08] teenager I had severe issues with
[5:10] anxiety and depression and I I dealt
[5:12] with that all the way up until when I
[5:14] got saved and
[5:16] you know for
[5:17] thankfully the Lord has really helped me
[5:19] with that but you know when I
[5:22] you know somebody asked me to to pray
[5:23] for them if they have anxiety or
[5:25] depression it's not like it's not like a
[5:28] for me it's not
[5:30] it's not just a prayer right it's not
[5:32] it's not a normal fight it's a grudge
[5:35] match right like I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna
[5:37] pray for that person in a way that
[5:41] has some earnestness behind it because
[5:43] that's close to my heart right right I
[5:47] can really enter in and and really
[5:50] be be dedicated to that
[5:53] and so a lot of times you know we deal
[5:55] with stuff that's really heavy and it
[5:57] hurts and we struggle with it well maybe
[5:59] it's because when somebody else comes
[6:01] along because you want the same problem
[6:03] the Lord needs someone to to be there
[6:07] and
[6:09] as you know I I think of um
[6:13] of Peter
[6:16] let me pull my scripture I wanted to
[6:18] read
[6:19] um
[6:20] let's turn to uh
[6:22] mark 14.
[6:26] let's see here
[6:47] um we're gonna go Mark 14 and verse 27.
[6:57] um
[6:58] yeah
[6:59] and it says here
[7:01] and Jesus saith unto them
[7:03] all ye shall be offended because of me
[7:05] this night for it is written I will
[7:07] Smite the shepherd and the Sheep shall
[7:09] be scattered but after that I am risen I
[7:12] will go before you unto Galilee but
[7:14] Peter said unto him
[7:16] although all shall be offended yet will
[7:19] not I and Jesus said unto him verily I
[7:22] say unto you that this day
[7:24] even in this night before the Crow
[7:27] twice Thou shalt deny me Thrice
[7:32] but he spake the more vehemently
[7:34] if I should die with thee I will not
[7:37] deny thee in any wise likewise likewise
[7:41] also said they all
[7:44] okay I want to skip down to verse 66.
[7:54] um
[7:55] yeah and uh and as Peter was beneath in
[7:59] the place there cometh one of the maids
[8:01] of the high priest and when she saw
[8:03] Peter warming himself she looked upon
[8:06] him and said
[8:08] uh and that all also was with Jesus of
[8:12] Nazareth and he denied saying I know not
[8:14] neither understand what thou sayest and
[8:16] he went out into the porch and the
[8:18] caught crew
[8:21] and a maid saw him again
[8:25] and uh and began to say to them that
[8:27] stood by this is one of them and he
[8:30] denied it again and a little after
[8:33] they that stood by said again to Peter
[8:35] Shirley Thou Art one of them for thou
[8:38] art of Galilean and thy speech betrayeth
[8:41] a speech agreeth that they're too
[8:44] but he began to curse and to swear
[8:47] saying I know not this man of whom you
[8:49] speak and the second time the crew
[8:52] and Peter called to mind the word that
[8:54] Jesus said unto him before the
[8:56] crowed twice thou shall deny me Thrice
[8:58] and when he thought thereon he wept
[9:02] so here we have this event in Peter's
[9:04] life
[9:06] that I mean
[9:08] it's in about every gospel you've got to
[9:11] imagine this is something that's on
[9:12] Peter's heart real heavy you know this
[9:14] is something where here's Peter who is
[9:17] so
[9:18] you know so uh
[9:21] you know aggressive maybe that he was so
[9:24] bold and I'll I'll Stand I'll I'll go to
[9:27] the Grave with Christ I'll never turn my
[9:28] back on him willing to fight try to cut
[9:31] off a man's head when they came to
[9:32] arrest Jesus oh he's you know he's he's
[9:35] he's
[9:36] uh so
[9:38] um
[9:39] like just
[9:41] out there he's he's aggressive he's he's
[9:44] uh he's not going to back down
[9:47] zealous that's the word
[9:49] right up until he's in a situation where
[9:51] it's rubber meets the road and suddenly
[9:53] he's a coward yeah
[9:55] suddenly he's uh
[9:57] can't can't really be identified with
[9:59] Jesus right
[10:01] can't really can't really do what he
[10:03] thought that he could
[10:05] and now he's confronted with this thing
[10:07] confronted with the fact that he wasn't
[10:10] really who he thought he was
[10:12] and you know the the the religion that
[10:15] he thought he had didn't really hold
[10:18] and now he's he ends up he ends up
[10:21] you know
[10:23] failing miserably
[10:27] and and making an absolute I mean it's
[10:30] it's it's uh
[10:33] you know he's broken-hearted about it
[10:37] but then
[10:39] you know the Lord come you know on
[10:43] I I read this story and I and I
[10:46] I can't help but think
[10:49] that maybe because of this story without
[10:51] this event
[10:53] in Peter's life without this event where
[10:57] he was faced with
[11:00] you know standing up for for for the
[11:04] Lord and being identified with the Lord
[11:05] no matter the consequences
[11:07] and he fails
[11:09] and he fails to to be identified and he
[11:12] becomes ashamed of of the Lord without
[11:14] that event in his life
[11:16] you don't get Acts chapter 2.
[11:19] right you don't get the boldness that he
[11:22] has when the Holy Ghost comes in because
[11:25] now he's it's like the the the the Lord
[11:29] allowed him to have this this major
[11:31] event this major failing that he would
[11:33] become ashamed of so that when he's full
[11:36] of the Holy Ghost he's never going to
[11:38] allow that to happen again
[11:39] he's now got
[11:42] you know that's why he's going to stand
[11:44] there boldly on the day of Pentecost and
[11:46] and preach and and not back down and
[11:48] that everywhere he's gonna go he's never
[11:50] gonna slow down he's never gonna he's
[11:52] never gonna he's never gonna back down
[11:54] ever again because he did it once
[11:57] and he really didn't like it
[11:59] you know he didn't like how that ended
[12:01] up
[12:02] because you know the the the Lord sought
[12:05] occasion against the devil he sought on
[12:08] occasion there was he wanted there were
[12:10] so many things that Peter was going to
[12:11] have to come against that the Lord
[12:14] needed him to be
[12:17] uh Valiant he needed to be to be zealous
[12:20] he needed him to be on fire and so he
[12:22] was going to allow him to fail miserably
[12:24] to give him that motivation right to go
[12:27] to go set the devil's fields on fire yes
[12:30] you know and so so many times don't
[12:32] don't let
[12:34] don't let the devil tell you that your
[12:37] failures and your faults and these
[12:39] things that come upon you
[12:42] that you know when you you know it's not
[12:45] I'm not trying to you know make it an
[12:47] excuse to to fail what I'm saying is
[12:49] don't allow your failures to be let the
[12:52] devil keep you down use that you know if
[12:55] you as you know it's it's like when
[12:57] you're when you're training to be a
[12:59] fighter you know what you do is you you
[13:01] spar with people and you get beat up
[13:04] and they and you lose a lot you know if
[13:06] you're if you're training Jiu Jitsu
[13:07] right when you first start out Brazilian
[13:09] Jiu Jitsu first thing you do when you
[13:11] start out is lose all the time
[13:14] like you the the the trainer is going to
[13:17] just beat the snot out of you and
[13:19] there's nothing you can do about it and
[13:21] no matter how angry you get no matter
[13:22] how upset you get he's just gonna tie
[13:24] you into a pretzel again
[13:27] and you can be mad at him
[13:29] but that doesn't change the fact that
[13:30] you're in a you're a pretzel
[13:32] like it's and so
[13:36] but the the difference I I heard a a
[13:39] black belt he was a a martial arts
[13:41] instructor he said
[13:42] you know people because you have you
[13:43] have the different colors right
[13:45] represent how high how skilled you are
[13:47] as a you know they're different colored
[13:48] belts represent how skilled you are as a
[13:50] in that particular martial art
[13:53] and they said that the hardest
[13:55] uh I believe I think it's the the the
[13:58] the blue belt is the first one after
[14:01] what well white is the first one but
[14:03] then after that is the yellow okay
[14:05] anyways they said the the P I've heard
[14:07] that he said I've heard it said that
[14:09] people say the yellow belt is the
[14:10] hardest one to get because nobody
[14:13] nobody sticks it out
[14:15] people get their white belt and start
[14:17] training and then
[14:19] they get tired of it they're tired they
[14:20] get tired of losing so they quit
[14:23] and they don't recognize that no every
[14:26] time you lose every time you fail every
[14:28] time the instructor breaks you down is
[14:30] the opportunity to recognize that you
[14:33] could be better
[14:34] to recognize well where did I fail
[14:37] where did I fail what did I do wrong how
[14:39] can I be better be perseverant be be
[14:43] undaunted don't give up right don't when
[14:47] you're when you're you know when you the
[14:50] the problem the problem what the devil
[14:52] is trying to do
[14:54] is not get you to the devil doesn't care
[14:58] if you win or lose the devil cares if
[14:59] you don't get back up
[15:01] right it's the
[15:03] um during the second world war the
[15:06] um British
[15:07] very famously dropped a lot of
[15:09] um propaganda pamphlets on the Italians
[15:11] when they're trying to take the Italian
[15:12] Peninsula because the Italians World dug
[15:14] up in the mountains up in up in Northern
[15:16] Italy they couldn't get them out and the
[15:18] British flew planes over the the Italian
[15:22] entrenchments and dumped propaganda
[15:25] pamphlets basically it taught the it had
[15:27] instructions on how to fake an illness
[15:29] and a bunch of like propaganda about you
[15:31] know like basically like making them
[15:33] question why they why they were fighting
[15:34] the war
[15:35] and the idea was
[15:37] and the question is when I heard this
[15:38] wait a minute the British flew planes
[15:41] over the British or over the Italian
[15:43] lines
[15:46] and dropped
[15:47] propaganda they dropped pamphlets on
[15:49] them why don't they just drop bombs
[15:51] right it was the same planes it was the
[15:54] same wrist they burnt the same fuel they
[15:56] put the same pilots and aircraft in
[15:57] danger being shot down why didn't they
[15:59] just drop bombs on them
[16:01] and the reality was they got more
[16:03] Italian troops to Desert and become
[16:06] disheartened and leave and and leave the
[16:08] battlefield on their own then they could
[16:10] have killed with the bombs
[16:12] they were too dug in and the devil a lot
[16:14] of times he know he can't beat you all
[16:16] he can do is get you to give up
[16:18] and quit that's you're not he can't he
[16:21] can't really beat you the the problem
[16:23] isn't
[16:25] you know with too many times where we
[16:27] get so complacent we get so bogged down
[16:29] we we have some failure
[16:32] and some mistake that we keep falling in
[16:35] and and say oh well I'm just going to
[16:38] give up and be complacent now and I'm
[16:39] not I'm going to stop fighting on that
[16:41] point well
[16:43] okay but now the devil's got you licked
[16:47] the problem isn't when you fail the
[16:51] problem is that you didn't get back up
[16:52] and keep trying the problem you know you
[16:55] have some issue that you keep running
[16:57] into well
[16:58] be analytical be stop and ask ask
[17:01] yourself why did I fail here
[17:04] well maybe there's a coin maybe there's
[17:06] a common denominator that every time you
[17:08] go to a certain place or do a certain
[17:09] thing or or whatever it is you're gonna
[17:12] that's where the devil knows you're weak
[17:13] and so he's going to hit you there
[17:15] and so
[17:20] what what we need to do is we need to
[17:22] stop letting the devil convince us that
[17:24] this is the end and instead
[17:27] recognize that what this is an
[17:29] opportunity
[17:30] to let the Lord fight with you
[17:34] what this is an opportunity is
[17:37] that the maybe what's going on here is
[17:39] that the Lord has an occasion against
[17:41] this issue in your life maybe this is
[17:44] that the Lord has the Lord is trying to
[17:46] do something here and instead of being
[17:48] disheartened and instead of being
[17:50] despondent what we need to do is is
[17:52] fight even harder right go on a rampage
[17:56] go go fight back as hard as you can and
[17:59] even if you fail again you get back up
[18:01] and keep swinging right Samson the Lord
[18:04] had occasion against against the
[18:06] Philistines all of Samson's life
[18:10] and he kept on getting hung up with
[18:13] Philistine women for the rest of his
[18:14] life
[18:16] all the way up until he tore their
[18:17] Temple down and killed more of them in
[18:19] his death than in his life
[18:22] you know the the the you know again it's
[18:26] not a it's not to say that this is okay
[18:28] that we fail it's to say
[18:31] don't let it discourage you and don't
[18:33] let it don't let it dissuade you from
[18:36] fighting every time Samson failed it was
[18:39] every time Samson got hung up with some
[18:41] Philistine woman was the the Capstone of
[18:44] that was that he turned around and
[18:45] fought on the Lord side and destroyed
[18:47] Philistines
[18:48] right no matter who it was right this
[18:51] this Philistine he gets married to this
[18:52] Philistine woman he goes and burns her
[18:53] crops down he gets hung up with a
[18:55] prostitute in Giza he rips the gates off
[18:57] their City you know he ends up getting
[18:59] uh mixed up with Delilah and goes in in
[19:01] the end of it pushes the temple over
[19:04] right when he dies the the the the the
[19:07] the the the moral of the story here is
[19:10] again to not let ourselves be despondent
[19:14] I um
[19:16] I just got a couple minutes left and I I
[19:18] had something I was thinking about
[19:20] um
[19:22] you know it it occurred to me
[19:26] that
[19:27] you know in uh
[19:29] I don't have time to read it because I
[19:31] just literally have a couple minutes
[19:31] left but it's in First Corinthians 6
[19:33] Paul says that you know that he says no
[19:35] you're not that you we will judge Angels
[19:37] right and we'll judge the world and
[19:39] angels
[19:40] well
[19:42] we there's going to come a day when the
[19:45] bride of Christ is going to sit on the
[19:46] throne right and judge the world the
[19:48] great white Throne judgment
[19:50] and maybe the reason why God allows his
[19:54] family to go through some of these
[19:55] things and have failures and faults and
[19:57] and different issues is because
[20:01] everybody deserves a jury of their peers
[20:04] right
[20:05] how
[20:07] it's one thing for the people of the
[20:09] world to come before the great white
[20:10] Throne judgment and be judged by A
[20:13] Perfect God who never did anything wrong
[20:14] it's another thing to be judged by a
[20:16] bunch of people who absolutely did
[20:18] things wrong who were just as bad as
[20:20] everyone who comes before that throne
[20:21] and yet we're still saved anyways
[20:23] because they saw they they took the
[20:26] atonement when they had the opportunity
[20:27] there was a very famously um the
[20:31] Nuremberg trials
[20:32] when all the Nazi war criminals were
[20:34] were tried for the things that they had
[20:36] done there was a judge who before though
[20:39] the war broke out and the Nazis were
[20:41] taking coming to power they were making
[20:42] all the judges sort of give bad
[20:45] judgments so they could lock up the the
[20:47] opponents to the Nazi party and he said
[20:49] he wouldn't do it he he wouldn't go
[20:51] along with it and they threatened him
[20:52] threatened his family they threatened
[20:53] his life so he packed up and fled and
[20:55] went to America and basically lived in
[20:57] poverty they lived on the streets
[20:58] because they didn't have anywhere to go
[21:00] um German law isn't exactly a
[21:02] transferable skill to the United States
[21:04] and um after the war
[21:07] he goes back to Germany and they're
[21:09] looking for judges to preside over the
[21:11] over the trials
[21:12] and he was one of the judges that they
[21:14] picked
[21:15] because they said who better to judge
[21:18] these people than the people who didn't
[21:19] take the bribes who didn't go along with
[21:22] the agenda
[21:23] and so when all these people would come
[21:25] before me says well we had to do it they
[21:26] threatened our family said yeah they did
[21:28] they threatened my family too but I
[21:30] didn't go along with it I I wasn't
[21:31] willing to go down that path and
[21:36] I think maybe that's what that's why we
[21:38] go through some of these things because
[21:39] the Lord has occasion against particular
[21:41] Devils but on the day of judgment when
[21:44] when justices served finally
[21:47] there's going to be people there who
[21:50] are are are the living evidence of why
[21:53] these angels must be punished the way
[21:56] that they are right there's a
[21:59] it's you know we we are the testimony
[22:04] that will convict the people who didn't
[22:07] take the atonement
[22:09] you know your life your life is the
[22:11] testimony that will convict the devil
[22:13] and the angels and all the world that
[22:15] follows them
[22:16] right
[22:17] so
[22:18] it's uh
[22:20] that's where we gotta quit
[22:22] so we'll stand and have a word of prayer
[22:25] and we'll be dismissed
[22:28] foreign
[22:29] Lord I Thank you for this opportunity to
[22:32] say a few words that maybe would
[22:35] encourage somebody to press on and
[22:38] and take the fight to the devil lord and
[22:40] be encouraged
[22:42] Lord I consider it an honor that I'll be
[22:46] able to maybe encourage someone
[22:48] so Lord I asked that
[22:51] you wouldn't
[22:53] you would
[22:54] make it so that the people would not
[22:56] think that would be my words that they
[22:58] would recognize that that these are your
[22:59] words and that you would be able to that
[23:01] you would be the one speaking to them
[23:03] not me that I I couldn't I couldn't help
[23:06] anyone Lord
[23:07] so I asked you would Bless the people
[23:09] bless the service the coming service
[23:10] Lord you'd be
[23:12] in our worship that you would come down
[23:13] and dwell with us and speak to our
[23:15] hearts we ask these things in Jesus name
[23:17] amen
