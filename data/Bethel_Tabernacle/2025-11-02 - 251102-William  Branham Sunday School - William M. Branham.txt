========================================

You know, there's something about it that when we see our Lord Jesus do things and can know that it's him that nothing else could do it but him, we just simply when we get together, we just everybody wants to testify. &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to say something and they want to talk about it. You could have a revival at your church. The pastor can speak a marvelous message or the evangelist or whoever it might be or you can see some certain thing take place or something in the neighborhood someone was healed. The neighbors get together and talk about it. How marvelous was you there? You should have seen it. It was the most outstanding thing. Something about the works of God that thrills man's heart more than anything else that happens. Amen. There's it's just an unforgettable experiences when we come in contact with the Lord Jesus and see the things that he does. &gt;&gt; So great and marvelous is his ways. &gt;&gt; Now we find out that they were rejoicing over the works that had been done in that day's revival and perhaps I would liken us tonight in the same manner. Uh we have just witnessed one of the greatest revivals. I believe that the world has ever seen in these last 1015 years. It's been a a revival not just like the days of Billy Sunday or the days of the Welch revival or the days of of Wesland revival or the Moody revival or Billy Sunday revival. It's been a worldwide sweeping affair around the world. great healing services and great revival fires is burnt on practically every hill there is in the world &gt;&gt; right tonight way over in the lands of Africa down in China Japan THIS GOSPEL IS BEING PREACHED AND people are being healed right this very minute &gt;&gt; around and around the worldise &gt;&gt; it's been one of the greatest revivals because I believe it's one of the last revivals this world has seen &gt;&gt; a world's sweeping revival. But now in the last few years, it's quietened down. You don't notice the enthusiasm in the people that used to be. &gt;&gt; I remember having the privilege by the Holy Spirit to spearhead that revival. It started that angel of the Lord appeared on the river and said that &gt;&gt; about many years ago. And to see it happen and see it set ministers hearts of fire everywhere. Revival broke out. Why? You could just simply walk into a building and the people just get up out OF THEIR CS AND STRETCHERS AND WALK AWAY HEALED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You didn't even have to say ONE WORD. JUST JUST BEING THERE. That's all it taken. I remember one night in Van Dailyaly, Illinois. Walked into the meeting and no more had been in the meeting over five minutes. AND THERE WASN'T A FEEBLE PERSON around the place anywhere. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Wheelchairs pushed out and piled up. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BLIND WAS SEEING and deaf and dumb speaking and and just simply it the spirit of the Lord was present and it just healed a whole group of them. &gt;&gt; Now that's when you can do something when revival is going. But let that revival fire die down. Then you can hardly the people are still Christians but they're not revived INTO THAT SPIRIT THAT GREAT atmosphere that does something. It's just like in a forge in A BLACKSMITH SHOP. YOU'VE GOT TO GET THE IRON HOT BEFORE YOU GO TO pounding it on the anvil. If you don't, you'll never straighten it out. That's what it takes TO HAVE A REVIVAL IS EVERYBODY UNDER THE HEAT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT &gt;&gt; that's brought down the powers of God and a revival moving. Then there's prayer meetings going day and night, every minute everywhere while the people wouldn't even leave the grounds. I remember in Jonesboro, Arkansas, when I first started my about my third meeting, first in St. Louis, then at Carnegie, then down to Jonesboro, the paper stated 28,000 people in the meeting for 20 or 30 miles from the city with this tent set up. You couldn't get a farmhouse to stay in little city of Jonesboro. and people coming for miles, packing lanterns, walking through the jungles, catch a a bus and come. I sat out in the wilderness one evening praying before the service started. I seen young ladies coming with their shoes and stockings under their arm. Then before they get down there, stop and brush off the dust from their feet, put on their stockings and and and shoes and go into the meeting. And I've seen them lay their sick children under old cotton trucks AND STAY THERE DAY AND NIGHT. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hold papers and canvas over while it was raining. STORM OF BLOWING, NOT LEAVE THEIR PLACE WAITING JUST TO GET INSIDE the building. &gt;&gt; There's where the blind was seeing, the deaf was hearing. And the MINISTRY TONIGHT IS A 100 MILES BEYOND THAT. BUT THE revival fires has died down. See the people walk up there and say just point your finger say well do you believe brother that's all he's out and gone that's all it had to be done they believe the revival is a moving now these disciples had seen that and in a amateur form they were living the joy while Jesus was resting of what they'd seen done that day and I think the revival was doing something like that that we're now just living in a quietening time while he's resting uh maybe between the meetings or the revival and his coming and we are rejoicing over the things that we have seen done during the time of this revival. &gt;&gt; Great wonderful works. No matter what the world says, we still seen it done. It's a statement. It's a fact. It was done. They must have took an opportunity while the sales was going along pretty well to talk about him, about his acts, about his claims, about his messiahship. Many of them might of these disciples might have spoke of what they had seen done one to another just like we do during the time of the revival at at Shreport, during the time of the revival at at some other town. would talk about it now. That's the way they were doing. Maybe it was Simon as we talked about last night saying, "Well, when Andrew told me about him, I was just a little bit skeptic." But when he told me who I was &gt;&gt; and who my father was, that took all the guess out of me. I I believed it. Then it might have been that Philip might have said some of the other way. It might have been Andrew says, "We talked about the lady at the well last night. might have been talking about her when they said something like this. Brethren, you know when my strange time was when I we went away to get some fiddles and we come back and we're standing outside the bushes and seen him talking to this ill famed woman, we thought in our hearts, what if uh some of the priests would come up and see this our master talking to a woman of this caliber? What would they say about him? And then we remember how we knew that had confidence in him that it was for some purpose that he was talking to her. And then when he told her, "Go get your husband and come here." And she said, "I have no husband." How our hearts jump because we thought there's one time there's a failure. Jesus had told the woman that she had go get her husband when she had no husband. You remember the look that we had on each other's face as we marveled to think that all the confidence we had in him and here it was dropped all of a sudden. Then we find immediately he spoke UP AND SAID, "YOU'VE TOLD THE TRUTH FOR YOU'VE HAD FIVE HUSBANDS and the one you have now is not yours." Then when she recognized him then as the Messiah, the Messiah of God, and said there that we know that Messiah's coming, he must be a prophet, for we know when the Messiah cometh, he's going to do this. And the testimony in that city, that woman's testimony had bearing on the people of the city. &gt;&gt; Then it might have been young John that said, you know, I tell you what made it real to me. that day when he broke the bread. Now we was all hungry and you'd went out into the wilderness and we couldn't find him and there we met him and all the multitudes came around and the first thing you know we find him saying send him away to the city to get some food and and he told us to feed a man and he got those five biscuits and two little fish and he broke that bread and I noticed his hand when he would reach back for another piece of bread that biscuit It has grown out again. Reach back. That fish has grown out again. Not only the regular fish, but it was a cooked fish &gt;&gt; already grow back again. What kind of an Adam did he turn loose? Brethren, cooked fish, cooked bread, bypass the growing. We know he's the creator, but here he's making creation of already cooked fish and cooked bread. John might have said something like this. He said, "You know, when I was a little boy, we lived down by Jericho, and I remember my Jewish mother used to rock me to sleep in the afternoon, take my afternoon nap. I used to look up in her eyes and she'd tell me Bible stories." And you know, that's a good thing for any mother to do to her child. &gt;&gt; Bring up a child the way it should go. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; it'd be better turning on the television, watch uh some of these things that goes on on the television. be better off you reading my Bible story &gt;&gt; cuz it's impressing his little mind. &gt;&gt; Now Satie you she used to tell me about the a story of the Shunomite woman receiving her little boy back to life by the prophet Elijah. I like that. Then she used to tell me about our people coming up out of Egypt. was right on the Jordan River. And she'd point across river and say, "John, they camped just on the other side." And they were 40 years in that wilderness. And God fed a man. Their clothes never wore out. And God gave them bread fresh every morning. And how my little childish heart I used to say, "Mama, has God got a lot of big ovens up there in the skies and he bakes all this bread and gets these angels ready that bring down the morning bread and lay out on the No, I should say, John, you're too young to understand. God doesn't have ovens in the sky. He don't need ovens. We have to have ovens." But God doesn't need it because he's a creator. &gt;&gt; See, he just speaks. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the bread laid out on that. &gt;&gt; He is the creator. And brethren, when I stood there today and watched him take that piece of bread AND TEAR IT OFF AND WHEN HE REACHED BACK FOR ANOTHER PIECE, IT WAS CREATED. I know we wasn't following following a false prophetise &gt;&gt; that was the creator himself &gt;&gt; in man. And uh then they might have discussed the attitude of some of the people. Some believed, some did not. And then his attitude towards the people. Now you know Christianity has changed so much in these last days. NOW YOU'VE got to baby a person. Promise them a whole lot. Give them a whole lot to make them believe, come to church, HAVE PROMISE THEM THAT THEY'LL have better associates AND EVERYTHING. THAT'S NOT CHRISTIANITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; CHRISTIANITY IS NOT BABYED. CHRISTIANITY IS RUGGED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. RIGHT. It's a It's a Christianity is not a hotbed plant. &gt;&gt; A hot bed plant is a hybrid plant mostly. You have to spray it all the time. Keep the bugs off of it. That's because of its weakness. &gt;&gt; That's what you HAVE TO DO. A LOT OF CHRISTIANS KIND OF SPRAY THEM WITH A A LOT OF PROMISES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You you don't need it. &gt;&gt; A REAL GENUINE HEALTHY PLANT DON'T NEED any spraying. the bugs stay off of it. &gt;&gt; It's just like today that man trying to take things and pervert them. God in the beginning, he said, "Let every seed bring forth of its kind." I was reading in Reader Digest here where the they're taking what we call a hybrid corn and it makes a prettier ear. Sure, great big fine ear, but it is no good. Nothing to it. And they make a better tomato. don't even taste like a tomato. They make got a chicken now that don't even have wings. Hybriding. See, and now remember, you might have hybrid corn, but you can't plant that seed back. It won't produce again, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It'll die. &gt;&gt; Why? It don't have no life in it. You have to hybrid it each time. If it wouldn't, it just keep on multiplying. That shows that evolution, according to man's ideas, is wrong. You can take a a mare horse and a jack and breed them together to get a mule. But a mule cannot breed itself back again. It's finished. That's all. He's finished. And they say now that in another 20 years, if they don't keep these people meeting this hybrid stuff like of corn and wheat and stuff that they're hybring, that is changing the the posture of women. that won't be able to have babies in 20 years from now. It's killing the generation, that hasn't got the STUFF IN IT, MAN'S NOT MADE LIKE THEY used to be. Look at man today. WHILE THERE USED TO BE BALL GAMES WAS ROUGH, NOW THEY HAVE TO WEAR HELMETS TO KILL A DOZEN EVERY YEAR. HIT HIM ON THE HEADS LIKE A GUINEA. He dies right now. FIGHTS AND EVERYTHING. MAN'S MADE UP OUT OF A BUNCH OF MUCK. IT'S IT IT'S BECAUSE OF HYBRID STUFF. IT HAS polluted the whole system of of our living, our whole economy. AND AND AND THAT HYBRID'S GOT INTO THE CHURCH, TOO. Instead of having a real RUGGED BUNCH OF BIBLE BELIEVERS, THEY'VE HYBRIDED BY DENOMINATIONS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And they have to say, "I GOT THIS, I GOT THAT, &gt;&gt; and I belong to THIS, AND I BELONG TO THAT." IT'S HYBRID. &gt;&gt; AND THE THING CAN'T PRODUCE ITSELF AGAIN. WE NEED A BOOK OF ACTS AGAIN. BUT THE ONLY WAY YOU'LL DO IT IS GET BACK TO THE BIBLE AND AWAY FROM SOME OF THIS HYBRID RELIGION, &gt;&gt; high breeding. Had to be babyed. No faith. Just a bunch of powder puffs. Just sensified baby into it. I'm I say you're a Christian. I'm Methodist. Are you a Christian? I'm Presbyterian. I'M PENTECOSTAL. THAT DON'T MEAN THAT TO GOD. YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN BECAUSE YOU'RE BORN IN THE SPIRIT OF Christ &gt;&gt; and the word of God lives in you. &gt;&gt; You know, uh always enjoy a hybrid horse. You know, he's got sense. You can you can teach him things, do things for him, &gt;&gt; and he'll learn. But you take an old mule, you can't do nothing to him. He's just a big old LONG-HAIRED DONKEY. HE SITS THERE AND YOU CAN TALK TO HIM. HE'S STICKING HIS EARS OUT and h see that HE'S JUST A HYBRID. PUTS IN MIND A LOT OF THESE SO-CALLED CHRISTIANS HYBRID DONKEY RELIGION. YOU TELL THEM JESUS CHRIST THE SAME YESTERDAY AND FOREVER. I don't believe it. See, SO YOU CAN'T NEVER TEACH him nothing. HE'S GONE ANYHOW. MY CHURCH BELIEVES IT THIS WAY. MY BELIEVES IT THAT WAY. BUT GOD'S WORD SAYS HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY AND TODAY AND FOREVER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I like not a hybrid Christian. I like a like a pedigreed horse. He knows who his papa was, who his mama was, who his grandpa and grandma was. He knows all the generations all the WAY BACK. SO DOES A petty Christian. HE KNOWS WHO HIS FATHER IS. HE COME FROM GOD. HE'S THE WORD OF GOD. HE'S THE SAME AS HE EVER WAS. HE'S A REAL PETTY PRODUCT OF GOD. THE word of God is in him. Jesus Christ manifested himself. &gt;&gt; Bunch of unbelievers. Jesus wanted to shake off a bunch of parasites one day. He had too many following him. He had his disciples. Then he had the 70, the ministerial association. Then he had the congregation by the thousands. And then he made this statement. HE SAID, "EXCEPT you eat the blood, eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, what do you think a medical doctor would say sitting out in the congregation? What do you think a sensible thinking man would? What we call sensible thinking? He never explained it. He didn't have to explain it. While the doctor said, "Get away from that fell. He's crazy. He We'll be human vampires drinking the blood of a man, feeding his flesh." And the congregation, I imagine the priest said, "This is the time. Here's where we come in." Out we go. We'll never attend another one of the meetings. Away they went. Then he got all them away from him. Then he turned around and he said to the 70, HE SAID, "WHAT WILL YOU say when you see the Son of Man ascending up into heaven? From whence's he comes said the son of man ascending up from whence he come while he's had us at the very manger where he was born. We know his mother. We seen the clothes the swallowing cloth he was wrapped in. He was born down there in Bethlehem of Judea. He was brought up over HERE IN NAZARETH. THERE'S HIS BROTHERS, his sisters, and all of them with us. And then he said, "THIS SON OF MAN HAS SENT IT UP." HE DIDN'T EXPLAIN IT. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He just said it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, THEY COULDN'T EXPLAIN IT. THEY COULDN'T FIX IT out in their mind. Well, they said, "Yours where we come in." So, they went out. That's as much as they COULD STAND. THEY STILL HAD THE SAME GROUPS. &gt;&gt; That's right. We still have them. We notice then he turned. REMEMBER THOSE DISCIPLES COULDN'T explain that either, &gt;&gt; but they had faith. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus turned and looked to the 12 and said, "Would you go also?" Then Peter made those notable words, "Lord, where would we go? For we are fully persuaded. We know that you have the word of life and you don't think they couldn't explain how he's going to eat his flesh and drink his blood. They couldn't understand how he's going to send up where he come down from when he was born in Bethlehem. THEY COULD BUT SEE FAITH DON'T KNOW NO FAILURE. It's anchored. It stays there. NO MATTER WHAT ANYTHING SAID, &gt;&gt; it stayed there. They were ordained to this life and he's they stayed there. Now those different kinds, some believed, some said a man never spoke like this. Some didn't believe and they said, "Well, that might disgust that." Some said, "A man never spoke like this man." There's something strange about him. WHAT HE SAYS, he's able to back up. Well, they did say that she said he don't talk like a priest. He doesn't talk like a rabbi. &gt;&gt; For what he says, God backs it up. &gt;&gt; He vindicates what he said. &gt;&gt; Oh my. It must have been young John then said, "Think of it. We have him with us right now." What a comfort that must be. WHAT A SECURITY. WHAT A SECURITY IT OUGHT TO BE TO US. &gt;&gt; YES, &gt;&gt; I'm a missionary round and around the world. And I've seen all kinds of religions and all kinds of gods that they have. the heathen gods, the Mohamad, the Buddha, and seek Jane or whatever more and the heathen gods, the tribesmen. But every one of them, there's none of them, right? But Christianity, every one of them, their founders are dead and they got the grave where HE WAS BURIED. BUT CHRISTIANITY IS THE ONLY ONES, RIGHT? BECAUSE OUR FOUNDER DIED, BURIED, but rose again. AND WE CAN PROVE THAT HE'S ALIVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; At the grave of Muhammad for the past 2,000 years nearly been a white horse change guards ever so many hours waiting for Muhammad to rise up the dead and ride down the world and conquer it. BUT JESUS IS ALREADY UP FROM THE DEAD. &gt;&gt; BEEN UP FOR 2,000 YEARS AND IT'S WITH US TONIGHT. YES. &gt;&gt; And then when we see the darkness and see the end of time way it is now coming up to the hours that we're living &gt;&gt; while we're sailing life solemn WHERE THE STORMY SEAS AND AND THE VESSEL CAN WRECK AT ANY TIME. THESE LITTLE LIGHTS CAN SNAP OUT LIKE THAT &gt;&gt; or we might never leave this building tonight. &gt;&gt; None of us. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT time deaths are coming and what to THEIPLES TO KNOW THAT THE VERY creator that had thoroughly identified himself to be that person WAS SAILING WITH THEM. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT A BLESSED THOUGHT IT IS. WHAT A BLESSED HOPE IT IS. WHAT AN ASSURANCE IT IS. &gt;&gt; AND THIS DARK HOUR AT THE END OF WORLD'S HISTORY TO KNOW THE CREATOR IS SAILING LIKE SALOMINE WITH US. safely tucked in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Arms, whatever may come, let them ride, burst, blow, whatever they want to, it makes no difference to me. &gt;&gt; I'm sailing with the creator. &gt;&gt; What a security while sailing these waters. &gt;&gt; Now, while speaking, talking of him about what great things he' done at the revival, feasting, Jesus was probably resting like he is. I said between the revivals and we they had been so clearly identified to who he was. The people knew who he was of those who was BLINDED BUT THOSE WHO HAD A HOLD on the scripture because they know that the scripture God's word has been given a lot to each generation. AND THAT PROMISE OF THAT AGE HAS to be fulfilled. AND HE FULFILLED EXACTLY WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE done in the time of the Messiah. He met every qualification. Then we he was assured that he was the man. &gt;&gt; But you see, HE WAS SO COMMON. He didn't dress like a priest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had no not an education as as what we'd call education. We had no record of him even going to school. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIM THAT WAS DIFFERENT. And then he invited them when they couldn't understand said, "Search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life." And that's the thing that testifies of me. &gt;&gt; They tell you who I am. &gt;&gt; And I remember that all had this in their heart and was thinking of these things. And while sailing around on the sea, how they could be like children as long as he was in the ship with them. NOW FRIEND, WHAT THAT ought to do to us. THE SAME IDENTIFIED JESUS CHRIST, the same creator, THE SAME GOD IS WITH US TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; WHAT A SECURE IT IS. WHAT A FEELING to know that his presence is here. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now &gt;&gt; we find right when they having this great time all of a sudden trouble arose. The ship rock the sails blew off. The water filled the boat. All hopes of survival was gone. Now isn't it strange? Just like it is now as we're coming down to the end now. Isn't it strange? We can talk about how great he is. We can tell how great he is in our church when we testify. We tell the our our employees employers how great he is. We tell the people on the street how great it is. AND WHEN TROUBLE STRIKES, WE ARE FRUSTRATED. &gt;&gt; We just the things that we've seen him do, the things that we know he does, and just let a little sickness or a little trouble strike the home. Watch what happens. &gt;&gt; All gone to pieces. All All hopes are gone. Though they had seen him do so many things, all forgotten when trouble strikes. Like now we have seen this great revival. We have history of other great revivals. We have his presence. We know these things. And sometimes trouble sets in that we can't remedy. They u for instance like now we have trouble in our churches. Now we have denominational troubles, arguments in our churches. We don't know what's going to take place. We see a great thing forming up there. All of us believers in the Bible see something's fixing to take place. There's nobody what knows that. And all the churches are going to be brought into that ecumenical council of churches. &gt;&gt; And when you do that, you're going to forfeit your great evangelical teaching of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Pentecostals are sympathizing with it, going right into it like a hog going to its slaughter, &gt;&gt; right? Ecumenical council, many great Pentecostal leaders agreeing with them. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, don't you never stick your neck in a thing like that. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what the Bible said would come to pass. There's the beast in the market perfectly. Everything's set right in order. And we see this and we wonder what's going to be the outcome of it. trouble set in and they forgot that the very one that they were talking about, the very creator was in the boat with them. NOW, YOU SAY, "IF I COULD THINK THAT, WELL, REMEMBER, we still have him because he's the word always." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And John 1:1, as we spoke last night, he was the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we still have his word that directs us to his thoughts and his doings for this day. &gt;&gt; See the not the thoughts Moses had in his day, not the thoughts of disciples, not the thoughts of Luther or Wesley or the Pentecostal age or any of those. We have the Bible here that tells us of what's going to happen now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, we see the Pentecostal revival in the Bible, the Lutheran and all those church ages. We saw them. But we also HAVE THE SCRIPTURE HERE TELLING US WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE NOW. And that's God. God interpreting his own word for this age that we're living in. &gt;&gt; He's his own interpreter. And yet we get frustrated. Paul be frustrated. His disciples sometimes get physical troubles that they can't remedy such as sickness, cancer.
