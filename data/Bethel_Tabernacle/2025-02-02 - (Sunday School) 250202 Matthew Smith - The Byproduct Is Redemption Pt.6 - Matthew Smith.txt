TRANSCRIPT
========================================
gracious father Lord we invite you into our Sunday school this morning Father as we come before you opening our hearts to the word Lord that You' come down and edify us that father wouldn't just be some idea or some thing that I would have come up with but Lord that you would speak through this microphone strength andage enouragement father that they would grow stronger and and and closer to you father and and that you would go out and meet the needs of the people father we open this service with an in an invitation to your Holy Spirit to move this morning that I would step out of the way and that my emotions would not Cloud what you would have to say we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen um I want to turn this morning um this is just kind of continuation of the my series that I've been doing and I I had thought the last time I did this this was the LA that was the last part but it was not um so uh the Lord kind of gave me something this morning kind of in that same topic and the same theme um so if we would let's turn to um Genesis chapter 1 and 26 said um did I yeah Genesis chapter 1 and 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth um and then one other scripture I want to read is 1 Timothy Chapter 2 um and verse 11 which um I'll just read it if y'all y'all don't have to turn to it just for the interest of time um it said uh let the woman learn in Silence with all subjection but I suffer not a woman to teach uh nor to use Ser authority over the man but to be in silence for Adam was first formed in Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and Holiness with sobriety y'all can be seated um now I wanted as sort of a brief sort of continuation of the idea of the of the thought that we had the last time we did one uh Sunday school which I think is about a a little over a month ago um uh we talked about this scripture in in uh 1 Timothy Chapter 2 and about how that the Plan of Redemption all throughout the Bible Redemption is tied to a woman uh giving birth to a child um with with um Adam and Eve that Eve or Adam had gone to Eve and through that came Abel and also Redemption of Eve back to Adam um we talked about obviously Ruth and Boaz that in order for Ruth to be properly redeemed to Boaz in the in under the Hebrew law um or in order for uh Boaz to properly redeem Ruth there had to be a union and ultimately the birth of a son um we talked about um how uh you know we see this theme throughout the entire Bible obviously with with Mary um giving birth to the Christ child and how all Redemption would come through that um and there's this you know overarching thing and then ultim L we talked about um uh John the Revelator in Revelations chapter 10 and how you know this exact same formula you know formula in sort of in a natural sense is also typed in the spiritual how John how he you know he took the word right the the life of the word in Revelation chapter 10 he ate the book and then replicated or expressed The Life of Christ back out when he prophesied again um and how this is the same uh sort of it's what the bride is expected to do right that we talk about you know the the invisible Union of of Christ and the church well what is that exactly right well it is Christ coming down building relationship with the church and through that relationship would ultimately be the the process by which the bride would then replicate The Life of Christ again amen okay it's this it's that same uh process um you know we talk about um letting the word be born in us like it was in Mary right it's it's the Christ again being born again through the lives of Christians living in this time right but that would process would come through feeding on the word by because Christ is the word by building that relationship with scripture through the teachings through the the the the feeding on the word for our day by by doing that you're building a relationship with Christ through his word which will then ultimately allow you to express back out what it is that you've been feeding on right the same life that you've been uh taking on will then Express back out through you and um I just a a continuation of that idea is actually um in communion right in the communion story because you know when in the in the story you know he he breaks the bread he you know eat you know he tells them to eat uh take the the the bread and the wine and um then he goes and washes their feet right he says the bread is his body right and so he he's you know we do this every year as sort of you know we know the Lord's supper and communion foot washing and we do this you know at least at this church maybe we've done it different times throughout the years um usually you know once a year on New Year's Eve but you know different churches do it different ways there's no real hard fast you know rule Bible just says Christ just said do it often in remembrance of me well how often is often right and that's you know up to the leading of of the individual pastor but what I don't want us to do and what I you just kind of uh to something to highlight is that you know um yes we do the sort of I don't want to say ritualized form but for lack of a better word ritualized form of the of the of the communion service maybe once a year maybe twice a year once a month however often um it you know different churches do it differently like I said but realistically really what the the point of that is is to remind us what is we doing it in remembrance of Christ and the the whole Plan of Redemption which is every single day you should be having a form of communion when you feed on the word you eat the body of Christ in the word and then what will it produce it will produce the character to serve your brother right it you know that story happens deliber liely didn't is not willy-nilly right when supper being ended then he washed his brother you know washed the feet of the disciples why because you feed on the word first and then it creates the character of Christ that will then perform the acts of service that Christ performed right and you can see and if you're doing communion correctly that's what it should be producing and just to to illustrate something you know the Catholics have communion every service but when was the last time you saw them break out the water and start washing feet right there they go together you can't have the one without the other because if all you're doing is is well we're feeding on the word but it never produces a lifestyle of of humility and service and Christ's nature then I'm not convinced that what you have is the word right or you're not feeding on it correctly right you're there's something wrong there something's not working because it should be you should be producing Redemption of bringing your character back in line with uh with the word um now I want to move on from that because there's a uh a I I I started this is just something that kind of came to me this morning and I I really is kind of what's burning on my heart um I uh I started this whole series with kind of um taking on a a particular quote those of you who remember that far back took I I I read this quote where in marriage and divorce brother brand talks about the woman being a byproduct and how so many people understandably so it's not a this isn't a criticism um but so many people uh have a hard time with that quote because it's it's you know it doesn't feel nice um and how and I went through the whole thing and and I don't obviously don't have time to re go over all that again if you want to hear that by all means we archives um but uh how but there's there was a lot more to it than that it's actually a beautiful thing if you get past sort of the the uh spooky exterior of that um quote and really look at what he was trying to say and what the scripture says and and the whole type of everything it's actually a lot more beautiful than than you might first think and there's another concept that I people have many preachers have have pointed out and it a lot of times bothers people and it bothered me for a long time and so I I want to kind of uh approach this and that is we talk about how in you know how when God made ab and Eve um how Eve was a weaker vessel and God knew that she was going to fall right God knew that she was going to she was going to fall and that that it was going to lead to the fall of Mankind through Adam and then and but God needed Eve Adam kind of needed Eve to be the weaker vessel because he had this attribute of a redeemer inside of him that he had to be fulfilled in order for him to be a fulfilled being right he had to be fulfill this attribute of Redeemer and if he had nobody to redeem and nobody ever fell then he would never be able to express the attribute of Redeemer um and likewise god um made man such that he knew man would fall he knew man was weak he knew man would fall because God had the attribute of Redeemer that he had to express and if there was nobody to save then he would never be a able to ex be fulfilled as a savior and and it's it can be a beautiful thing but but there's always the immediate question but wait a minute hold on hold on hold on so God made us flawed on purpose and now we have to suffer the consequences of God making us broken on purpose right like that seems kind of you know to the human mind it almost seems kind of like self-serving and unfair but I I just want to show you something when God made man he made both of them male and female Adam and Eve were made together and they were both made in the image of God everything inside of Adam was part of God and everything inside of Eve was part of God that she wasn't made out of castoff spare parts right she was as intentional as Adam was and if Adam inside of him had had an attribute to be a redeemer well didn't Eve also have an attribute inside of her that long to be redeemed amen is that not also the case doesn't Humanity don't we say this so often doesn't this a sort of a saying I I don't remember exactly where it originated so you know I don't know what to attribute it to but um I once heard and it just struck me so strongly um that every human being is born with a god-shaped hole in their heart and nothing they ever do other than like try to fill it with other than God will actually fill that every human being desires to be redeemed where did that come from that was an attribute of God it had to come from God where else did it come from it didn't come from the devil right it was part of God there was as much as Adam needed to feel like a you know fulfill the role of Redeemer in order for him to be fulfilled Eve needed to fulfill the role of the redeem Ed in order for her to feel fulfilled okay look if if the sort of natural typing the spiritual when you know it's not an accident that one of like the most uh basic widespread Universal cliche tropes of you know women what women find romantic is the hero who comes in and rescues her right like Saves the Day it's why we talk about the night and shining armor the prince charming the girl getting rescued from the dragon and I know it gets cliched into the ground and so it's by now most people kind of like roll their eyes at the whole at the such a simple story but consider look you know uh every girl on some level wants to feel beautiful and desired and and and respected and special and like she's not an off cast and that there is somebody willing to move heavens and earth just for her in particular because she feels ugly and unwanted and unlovable and all these things and all these women struggle with insecurity it's like one of the fundamental concepts of being a woman apparently and what girl is going to meet some guy who makes her feel the opposite of all of that like she's beautiful and cared for and loved and provided for and that he's she he finds things she's speci and is willing to do everything for her and you know it's the the Trope is what it is because it's Universal girls will be swept off their feet by a guy who makes them feel beautiful and special and and loved what's happening there there is a night and shining armor riding in to kill the dragon of insecurity that's been eating them from the inside out right I mean it it's not it's it's not that that uh you know so so you know we we it's just a type to show that that's exactly what God does it shows the relationship with with man to God because as much as you know every girl gets swept off their feet by their the hero who makes them feel loved and cherished and special human everybody who's ever been encoun you know looked around them and saw the the Calamity of their own life and saw how their own actions have led to the destruction of their own life have seen how I've done wrong and it has led to my family getting hurt people who care about me getting hurt myself getting hurt all of it and then God comes down and says but none of that matters I'm saving you and and and I don't you know he can Overlook all of that and rescue rescue you in particular from the wretchedness that is yourself amen right that's that sweeps us off our feet because there's there's something inside of every human being that longs for Redemption it Longs for Redemption and how could God how could you ever spend you know the whole purpose of all of this is that you end up spending an eternity with your sa with your savior but how do you have a fulfilled relationship when neither party ever got to fulfill the attributes that make them who they're supposed to be amen you're never how you're never going to have the same relationship with God you're never going to have the uh you know imagine a world for a second in which God none of this ever happened right none of the the fall never happened sin never happened it was all just whatever God just made everybody into a perfect paradise and nobody ever sinned and nobody ever failed and nobody ever had to you know uh nobody ever had to experience what it was like to need a savior and then receive salvation that is so much less of a of a of a deep relationship that is so much of a more so much shallower of a relationship but one in which all of humanity you know in for all of eternity is so grateful for what God did for them yeah so recognizing of of the of the price that was paid so so grateful having fulfilled what they were made to do right I promise you Humanity throughout all of eternity will feel so much deeper of a of a desire and a and a connection with Christ having been redeemed than if nothing bad would have ever happened right as much as uh God needed to feel like a redeemer we all needed to feel saved we all needed to express that because without it you just your relationship with God will not be the same right if you're not uh uh uh recognizing what God did the the relationship will never uh there's no bond there right right there's no grat there's nothing holding it together amen and so you know so many times people will take that longing that desire which is actually an attribute of God inside of them longing for God and try to fill it with all sorts of stuff right you know people we we we try to fill it with with you know whatever it may be you know the easy ones are drugs you know people no matter how much dope people smoke much liquor they drink no matter pills they pop it's never going to change the fact that they're Desiring something it'll quiet it down for a minute right it'll it'll you know knock the edge off for a minute it'll it'll put you out of your right mind long enough to where you won't recognize that you need God for a minute and then it's gone and then it's over and then you you have to chase it again just to get rid of you know quiet your conscience down long enough for it to not be tormenting you right and people will either try to fill it with drugs or they'll fill it with entertainment you know if they just consume enough entertainment it'll distract them from the the fact that they're you know uh not um Allowing God to to to be the Fulfillment that they're looking for you know I heard a um I I saw a long time ago I was doing some AC work for somebody and um I go in the house and they have on the wall a whiteboard I don't know where this came from I don't know if they came up with this or they saw it somewhere else but they just wrote on the Whiteboard if you don't know what you're looking for you will never find it amen and that's what people have they are looking for something they have no idea what it is right they are looking and looking and looking they're looking down every bottle they're looking under you know looking under every paycheck you know they work themselves in the ground to find a bigger paycheck maybe if they build a big enough house they'll find it maybe if they have a nice enough car they'll find it maybe if you know they uh you know go have enough entertainment they'll find what what it is that they're looking for maybe if you know you know girls think that they're they'll uh they'll find what they're looking for with enough you know plastic surgery and O zic right uh guys think they'll find what they're looking for if they have a fat enough paycheck and a big enough brokerage account right everybody's looking for something but at the at the end of the day that that that something they're looking for is God it's the it's Redemption it's salvation and they're and and and you know you try to uh try to quiet it try to kill it with with that that that thirst that hunger for God and you try to kill it with uh you know whatever you know whatever it is that that people are chasing and all it's going to do is make what you have unsatisfactory right the the the pleasure that you have no matter how great it was in the moment the second you realize that it is not filling the hole in your heart it will become unsatisfactory amen right and it's just people can you know you chase a a a material or a a a materialistic satisfaction for a spiritual thirst amen the whole world will never satisfy it amen the whole world will never satisfy that nagging little conscience in the bottom of your heart that's saying you need godallah nothing will ever will ever satisfy it amen except for God and that's good that is that is that is the attribute of God inside of you God put that there on purpose because once you actually satisfy it once you actually find the thing that will satisfy it which is nothing short of the Holy Ghost once you find that and and and actually satisfy that thirst well then you realize you don't need any this other stuff you don't need the massive house you don't need all the the the pills and and potions and and concoctions and whatever that a drug dealer will want to sell you right you don't need all of the the the material things of the world you don't need all of these uh you know you know whatever chasing things to to to satisfy by this desire because it's been fulfilled right the hole in your heart has been actually filled with something real and once you get there then you're you know you recognize that the all the rest of this is a sham right you actually have the you you find the peace that God intended you to have from the beginning that you only could have found if you fell in the first place right but you never would have been able to reach that point the the point of fulfillment and satisfaction and and genuine actual closeness with God you never could have reached that until you fell and recognizes recognized how much how how wonderful of a savior savior Christ can be and you know um so many times people we get hung up on stuff we get we get uh the devil will try to convince us that God um you know that that well I'll just maybe put it like this is the way it was on my heart this morning I was thinking a lot about how I got saved and there was a a moment when I'm sitting in the back office over here talking to brother Jason and I'm struggling because you know I'm like I don't even know what to believe anymore and and you know I I you know just believe in different things and and confused so confused and and brother Jason finally looks at me he's like listen and I remember I remember I I can't prove what I'm about to say to you I just know when I when it happened to me I knew what I saw me and brother Jason had this like two hour long conversation went absolutely nowhere I felt dissatisfied at the end of it he felt frustrated at the end of it and which you know in hindsight and I've heard his side of the story since then and you know he knew kind of knew exactly what was going on and I didn't but I'm you know we're kind of getting to the end of it and finally brother Jason which later I found out he' actually brother uh in prayer the Lord had told him to say this exactly like the day before but we get to the end of it and finally he stops and goes all right look here's the point of this whole thing he said you don't need to be convinced or you don't need to uh um be convinced that God is real right like you you've already like you're struggling trying to you know find something to believe in that you believe in God but you already believe in God because you believe in the you you're in love with God and you and you're because you're in love with the physical form of God you're love with God in flesh and so You' you've seen God In the Flesh and you know what that is which without getting into my whole life story The the exact words that he said were literally like the verbatim words to question answers to questions that he didn't know that I had um and and different things and and it just sort of just all clar for me in that moment but what caught me is right before he said that he kind of leaned back in his chair and right before he said it I literally saw light in his eyes like I saw light come into the room and and it was like it caught my attention and the reality is so many people we struggle with um do I you know is God still in my life do I what do I even believe do you know I feel so dry as a Christian I don't feel like I I you know like a Christian or whatever but the fact of the matter is you still long to be right you still long for righteousness you still long for salvation you still even if you don't you might not necessarily in your mind believe it but there's something in your heart that tells you that you want to be good amen there's something in your in in your heart that tells you you want to be right that you want to be righteous that you want to be pure that you don't want to be subject to you know the whims and desires of your flesh that you want to be right even if you don't feel it nothing was ever based on feelings right faith is feelings are anathema to Faith right if you want to kill your faith is faster than anything get into your feelings right like you know the reality is have faith in your salvation regard the fact that you desire that the fact that that there's something down in your heart that's longing for God no matter how deep of a hole you found yourself in the fact that you're longing for God means there's a part of God inside of you calling back to God right that there's a deep in you that's calling to the deep in God and those deeps respond to each other as much as you long for a savior the Savior Longs for you right and as much as if God so loved the world right God so loved the whole world you know even your wretched self and my wretched self right if God so loved all of that right that there's something inside of him that's Desiring the people of the world then the thing inside of you is just as sure as the thing inside of him amen right they have to come together whatever it is inside of you that's Longing To Be Good Will absolutely be fulfilled it has to and I'm out of time so let's stand and have a quick word of Prayer amen father Lord we come this morning thanking you for this time that we could come together as a church family to think on the things of your word Lord that maybe something that was said today this morning would be encouraging would be edifying to the people that they would draw strength from it and could move forward and and and not be so distracted and bound by the things of the world when the devil would come against them to to Blind their eyes to to to discourage them to convince them of of of the the you know to turn their head their their eyes from you Lord that that Lord your your word would give them strength and encouragement that they would press forward and and lay claim to your promises father we ask you'd be with us through the remainder of the service into the worship service and into the the ministering of the word ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music]
