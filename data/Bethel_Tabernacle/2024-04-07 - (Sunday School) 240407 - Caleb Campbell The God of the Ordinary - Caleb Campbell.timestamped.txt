[0:00] [Music]
[0:04] let's just stand to our
[0:07] feet sure is good to be in the house of
[0:10] the Lord amen amen let's all turn into
[0:14] our Bibles we're going to read two
[0:15] portions of scripture this morning we're
[0:17] going to start in Matthew's
[0:19] gospel we're going to read Matthew 1 if
[0:23] you want to turn to Matthew chapter 1
[0:25] and we're going to read verses 18- 25
[0:30] and it says now the birth of Jesus
[0:32] Christ was on the wise when as his
[0:35] mother Mary was
[0:36] espoused to Joseph before they came
[0:39] together she was found with child of the
[0:41] Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being
[0:44] a just man and not willing to make her a
[0:46] public example was minded to put her
[0:49] away privily but while she thought on
[0:52] these things while he thought on these
[0:54] things pardon me behold the angel of the
[0:56] Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying
[0:58] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[1:01] take unto thee marry thy wife for that
[1:04] which is conceived in her is of the Holy
[1:07] Ghost and he shall bring forth a son and
[1:08] thou shalt call his name Jesus for he
[1:10] shall save his people from their sins
[1:13] now all this was done that it might be
[1:15] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[1:16] by the prophet saying Behold a virgin
[1:20] shall be with child and shall bring
[1:22] forth a son and they shall call his name
[1:24] Emmanuel which shall be interpreted is
[1:27] god with us then Joseph being raised
[1:29] from the sleep did as the angel of the
[1:31] Lord had bidden him and took unto him
[1:34] his wife and knew her not until she had
[1:36] brought forth her firstborn son and he
[1:38] called his name Jesus we're going to
[1:40] turn over into Luke's gospel we're going
[1:41] to read one more portion of scripture
[1:44] this morning Luke 1 and verse
[1:47] 26 Luke chap 1 and verse 26 it's the
[1:50] same story just a different angle here
[1:52] and then in the in the sixth month of
[1:54] the the angel Gabriel was sent from God
[1:57] into a city of Galilee named Nazareth to
[2:00] a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[2:02] was Joseph of the House of David and the
[2:04] virgin's name was Mary and the angel
[2:06] came in under her and said hail Thou Art
[2:09] highly favored the Lord is with thee
[2:12] blessed art thou among women and when
[2:15] she saw him she was troubled at his
[2:16] saying and cast in her mind what manner
[2:19] of salutation should this be and the
[2:21] angel said unto her fear not Mary for
[2:23] thou Hast found favor with God and
[2:26] behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[2:29] and bring forth a son and shall call his
[2:31] name Jesus he shall be great and shall
[2:33] be called the son of the highest and the
[2:34] Lord God shall give unto him the Throne
[2:36] of his father David he shall reign over
[2:39] the house of Jacob forever and of his
[2:41] kingdom there shall be no end then said
[2:44] Mary unto the angel how shall this thing
[2:45] be seeing that I know not a man and the
[2:48] angel answered and said unto her the
[2:49] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the
[2:51] power of the highest shall overshadow
[2:53] thee therefore also that Holy thing
[2:56] which shall be born of thee shall be
[2:58] called The Son of God and behold Behold
[3:00] thy cousin Elizabeth she had also
[3:01] conceived a son in her old age and this
[3:04] is the sixth month with her who was
[3:06] called baren for with God nothing shall
[3:09] be impossible and Mary said behold the
[3:11] handmade of the Lord be it unto me
[3:14] according to Thy word and the angel
[3:16] departed from her let's open with a word
[3:19] of prayer this morning dear heavenly
[3:20] father we're just thankful and grateful
[3:22] to be in your house this morning Lord
[3:24] with the breaking of bread I just pray
[3:25] that you'd open up your word to us
[3:27] father God anoint this service Lord
[3:29] anoint this speaker father God just give
[3:31] us ears to hear this morning we pray we
[3:33] just commit all these things into you
[3:35] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[3:38] amen God bless you this morning as you
[3:39] take your
[3:40] seats I'd like to take a thought this
[3:43] morning on the god of the ordinary the
[3:46] god of the
[3:47] ordinary um this this this portion of
[3:50] scripture struck my heart yesterday as I
[3:52] was listening to a message of of God's
[3:54] Prophet brother Brandon preaches the
[3:55] message in
[3:56] 1964 God is his own interpreter uh
[3:59] before we get into that quote I wanted
[4:01] to drop this in here because it really
[4:03] helped me um I don't know if it would
[4:05] help anybody else in here or maybe I'm
[4:07] the only one but sometimes I don't know
[4:09] if anybody else gets into a rut of not
[4:11] knowing exactly what they need to listen
[4:13] to or what they need to read next um you
[4:17] know this this may help you know when
[4:19] brother George Smith was here he had
[4:21] gave us some some just basic Spirit M
[4:24] maintaining the spiritual life and His
[4:26] Four daily tasks were pray as often as
[4:29] you can read a page of the church age
[4:31] book read a chapter of the Bible and I
[4:33] believe the last one was listen to a few
[4:35] minutes of a sermon and I think that's
[4:38] just an awesome thing uh sometimes I
[4:40] struggle with which year I need to
[4:43] listen to or which book next and and
[4:45] it's just something very basic maybe
[4:47] it'll help somebody here but um I do
[4:49] well with structure in my life and and
[4:52] to with reading and listening and I like
[4:54] to accomplish goals and things so what
[4:56] I've done is in the past is I pick a
[4:58] year any year and I'll just beginning at
[5:00] the beginning of that year and just go
[5:03] until the end and quality is always
[5:05] better than quantity so you just take
[5:08] your time as you go through it and as it
[5:10] comes to listening don't rush through
[5:11] anything um something else that I've
[5:14] recently started is I picked two years
[5:16] you know I'll pick something in the 50s
[5:17] and then I'll pick something in the 60s
[5:19] and I'll listen to a couple out of one
[5:21] and then a couple out of the other and
[5:23] and you know that way I'm getting a good
[5:25] variety there um and then if you're
[5:28] struggling to find where to read next in
[5:30] the Bible brother brandom always takes a
[5:32] text out of every one of his scriptures
[5:33] right or every one of his sermons so you
[5:36] know make that part of your reading you
[5:38] know whatever sermon you're listening to
[5:40] he has a text that he opens up with go
[5:42] read that chapter and maybe maybe if
[5:45] it's a short book like you know
[5:46] something in the New Testament go read
[5:48] that book and then just kind of kind of
[5:50] go off of that um if it's something in
[5:52] the Old Testament dive into learning
[5:54] more about that book um you know
[5:57] sometimes I think we can get caught up
[5:59] in you you know where to go next or what
[6:01] to read next or what even to study so
[6:03] you know hopefully if you ever get into
[6:04] that place this is just a little nugget
[6:06] to kind of bring back to um it's really
[6:09] it's such a neat thing how the message
[6:12] of the hour opens the Bible up and makes
[6:13] it a new book you know preachers say
[6:16] that and that's not there it's not a
[6:17] cliche term you know we're going to get
[6:20] into this quote in here in a minute and
[6:22] it opened this story up to me in a new
[6:25] way and that's what the message does it
[6:27] opens up things to us in a new way amen
[6:30] and those spirits of inspiration they're
[6:31] not reserved for preachers only they're
[6:34] you have anybody can get inspiration in
[6:36] the word amen God can Inspire anybody's
[6:38] heart if they're zealous and they're
[6:39] searching for scripture and they're
[6:41] hungry for Revelation amen getting into
[6:44] our thought this morning the angel
[6:46] Gabriel visits Mary and and he tells her
[6:49] Thou Art highly favored in the sight of
[6:51] the Lord You're Going to conceive a
[6:53] child it will be called The Son of God
[6:55] without knowing any man and it seemed
[6:57] like a a pretty incredible thing and I
[6:59] want you to notice this you know Mary
[7:01] and Joseph were Ordinary People and yet
[7:04] God chose to do something extraordinary
[7:06] in their life amen and Mary believed it
[7:10] and at the snap of a finger and the word
[7:12] of an Angel she said those famous words
[7:14] be it unto me according to Thy word you
[7:17] know but when you read about Joseph you
[7:20] know it took a a little bit of something
[7:22] further and it's not that he didn't
[7:23] believe God the Bible said he was a just
[7:25] man and I'm going to read this quote and
[7:27] as I go along with it I'm going to make
[7:29] some comments but I really want you to
[7:30] put yourself in Joseph's shoes for a
[7:32] minute brother Venom says and God is his
[7:35] own interpreter he said Isaiah said a
[7:37] virgin shall conceive and she did now
[7:40] that was awful casual for see it was
[7:43] many hundred years later before this
[7:46] virgin
[7:47] conceived it was so unusual until a good
[7:51] man by the name of Joseph her husband
[7:53] being a just man and was not willing to
[7:56] make her a public example we read in the
[7:58] scripture that a good man in those days
[8:01] how it must have been with Joseph when
[8:03] he was engaged and espoused to Mary she
[8:05] was espoused and in that day to break
[8:07] that it was just the same as committing
[8:09] adultery and of course to Joseph it
[8:11] seemed like Mary was trying to use him
[8:14] for a blockade brother bom says or make
[8:16] him a shield for her wrong cuz here she
[8:19] was found to be a mother not being
[8:21] married only engaged and a trick like
[8:23] that would have gotten her stoned to
[8:25] death it had to be by the law so you
[8:27] look here and any human mind
[8:29] any human mind gets something presented
[8:32] to them and their reaction would be what
[8:34] Joseph's reaction was it's just the
[8:36] normal thought process well you know
[8:38] what happened Mary we loved each other
[8:40] we had a vow we made a vow to each other
[8:43] uh it it was it was
[8:45] unusual you know and he goes on to say
[8:49] Joseph her husband now remember in that
[8:52] time being engaged was like being
[8:55] married and that was a a consecrated vow
[8:58] amen and that was that was at that that
[8:59] time and we really you know we still
[9:02] have that in our hearts we still believe
[9:03] that you know once you make that vow you
[9:05] know that's that's a vow that you made
[9:07] to the Lord Jesus and to to that person
[9:10] and Joseph her husband he says was a
[9:11] just man a very just man he believed God
[9:14] and when she'd look at him with those
[9:15] lovely big soft eyes and say Joseph
[9:18] Gabriel the archangel visit me and told
[9:21] me that I was going to conceive not
[9:22] knowing no man now if Joseph would have
[9:26] just looked back in the scripture the
[9:28] prophet said she do that it was only God
[9:31] interpreting his own word see but it was
[9:35] too unusual now this next paragraph is
[9:38] what really struck me and what really
[9:39] brings out the reality of you and I the
[9:43] people here in this age in this day
[9:46] being like Mary was in that day be it
[9:50] unto me according to Thy word that's
[9:52] what's the matter in any age the word of
[9:55] God is foreign to people it's too
[9:57] unusual God always does the unusual it's
[10:02] unusual anywhere God is it's against the
[10:04] systematics of the world because that
[10:07] they've got the things the way that they
[10:08] think it should be but God comes in and
[10:12] he does the unusual amen the word of God
[10:16] is unusual it's against the systematics
[10:19] of our modern world you know because the
[10:22] modern world they've got things that
[10:24] they think that it should be this way or
[10:26] it should be that way but God comes in
[10:28] and he does it his own way because he's
[10:30] his own interpreter amen and I believe
[10:33] this I I love this because we are a
[10:35] bunch of common ordinary I am a common
[10:39] ordinary people that are like Mary and
[10:42] believe that when the seventh Angels
[10:44] said to us that it is the coming of the
[10:46] lord we believe it with all of our
[10:48] hearts amen and when the church age book
[10:50] said that he it's going to write another
[10:52] book of Acts with our lives we believe
[10:54] it because that's that's what we are we
[10:57] are merry in this day
[10:59] and I think one of the reasons it was
[11:01] such a difficult concept to you know
[11:03] such a difficult concept to grasp for
[11:05] Joseph was because him and Mary were
[11:08] common Ordinary People he was a just man
[11:12] and he was a godly man he said how he
[11:15] was just honest he said how how could
[11:17] this virgin conceive how could this
[11:18] thing be you know put yourself in that
[11:20] position how could these things you know
[11:23] bringing it today to this life how how
[11:25] can these things be in my life how can
[11:27] these how can these miracles happen how
[11:29] does it I mean I'm just a common person
[11:31] Lord you know I'm not a you know I'm not
[11:32] we're not bigname people you know we're
[11:34] just common people but God uses common
[11:37] people to do the unusual things he'll
[11:40] use you because that's what his
[11:43] scripture said that he would do he said
[11:45] that he would use you to do his Works
[11:48] amen so you got to put yourself in that
[11:51] place and we are just simple Believers
[11:55] of God's word you know we we're we're
[11:57] not anybody you know but see you look at
[11:59] at what we're doing is we're looking at
[12:01] ourselves from our Viewpoint and God is
[12:04] looking at us he was looking at Mary
[12:06] from his Viewpoint Mary was highly
[12:09] favored in his eyes not because she had
[12:12] some kind of great gift in her life or
[12:14] not because she you know had the ability
[12:17] to speak great or had this or had that
[12:19] she was highly favored because she was
[12:21] he looked into her life and he knew that
[12:23] she would believe the word of God he
[12:25] looked in your life and he knew that you
[12:28] would believe this word
[12:32] amen we are you know we're we're unusual
[12:35] people amen I'm unusual I'm an unusual
[12:37] person we come to church twice a week
[12:39] you know we spend our free time reading
[12:41] the scriptures and listening to messages
[12:44] you know we read the word and and we
[12:46] don't just read it we live it you know
[12:48] we eat it we we breathe it this word is
[12:51] everything to us we are I believe the
[12:54] manifestation of Revelation 19:7 the
[12:57] marriage of the Lamb has come and the
[12:59] bride hath made herself ready think of
[13:02] the natural type of that where a bride
[13:05] and a groom during I was just talking to
[13:07] Joy about this this morning during the
[13:09] preparation of of getting ready Caleb
[13:12] you know this about to happen the the
[13:14] bride is preparing things she she knows
[13:17] what the what the H the future husband
[13:19] likes she knows you know what what his
[13:22] tastes are she knows and so she's
[13:24] getting herself ready for that walking
[13:27] down the aisle you know because you're
[13:29] not supposed to see the Garment until
[13:32] you're walking down the aisle as as the
[13:34] as the groom you're not supposed to see
[13:36] the wedding dress until you walk down
[13:38] the aisle but until that point it's all
[13:41] about the preparation and right now as
[13:43] the bride of Christ we are in the
[13:44] preparation time we have the word of God
[13:47] we have the message we have what we know
[13:50] you know is is what God likes and what
[13:52] what what his word says and so we're
[13:54] doing what we what we know how to do
[13:56] because he's given us his Spirit that's
[13:58] the only way we can do it so he's given
[14:00] us his Spirit to to prepare ourselves
[14:03] for the marriage supper of the Lamb
[14:06] amen she she knows his desires you know
[14:09] they they've courted and they've been
[14:11] through this stage of getting to know
[14:12] each other and getting to understand the
[14:14] likes and and the dislikes and then when
[14:17] it comes down to to behold the bride
[14:20] when they walk down I remember that
[14:22] moment I just you know you just stand in
[14:24] all and and you maybe have a tear in
[14:26] your eye you're just so happy and you're
[14:28] just there's just such a a beauty to
[14:30] behold amen and that's that's you that's
[14:33] the natural in the spiritual sense what
[14:35] God God is is so excited about the
[14:38] marriage supper of the Lamb he is he is
[14:42] so excited about it you know and that's
[14:44] that's how I look at it when we look at
[14:46] preparing ourselves this is an exciting
[14:49] thing amen when when you're the common
[14:52] ordinary every day reading your Bible
[14:54] and listening to a message those things
[14:56] should be exciting in your life because
[14:58] you know that your groom is coming for
[15:00] you he he he wants to have this
[15:03] relationship so you you look at his his
[15:05] likes and his dislikes his taste and and
[15:07] you try to do everything to measure up
[15:08] to that amen just and you can only do it
[15:10] by him living in you
[15:17] amen I like the statistics I I like
[15:20] statistics um and I was I was doing
[15:22] doing math and you know out of the two
[15:26] message this is just you know unusual
[15:28] and talking about this I I was doing the
[15:30] math and out of the two message churches
[15:33] in our entire County between here and
[15:36] brother Samuel's down the road brother
[15:38] Blue's church is close but it's
[15:39] technically in another County it's in
[15:41] catton County which is right next door
[15:43] but in our County alone there is over
[15:46] 200,000 people living in just this
[15:48] County that's a lot of people over
[15:50] 200,000 people and I was probably maybe
[15:53] a little bit on the generous side with
[15:55] saying that 200 people between each both
[15:58] between both churches if you do the math
[16:00] on that you are in the 0.1 percentile of
[16:04] the county not the 1% the0
[16:09] one% sometimes you can get yourself so
[16:11] wrapped up in how is this and how is
[16:13] that you're in the 0.1% of just our
[16:16] County and you know our county is a
[16:18] small County in accordance with other
[16:20] counties and with other states and with
[16:22] other regions
[16:23] amen God can use
[16:26] you God can use you don't stay Bott
[16:28] battled up in a mentality that you can't
[16:30] ever be be used because of your past or
[16:33] because of your failures or just because
[16:35] you're a common person that that loves
[16:37] the word of God that has no special
[16:39] abilities or skills but you can be used
[16:42] in the kingdom of God Amen you are who
[16:46] God chose amen Mary didn't have like I
[16:51] said these crazy credentials she just
[16:53] simply believed God's word amen and her
[16:56] life proved it she wasn't favored
[16:59] because she came to church every Sunday
[17:01] or because she knew the statute of every
[17:03] law you know the Pharisees knew those
[17:06] things and they had their own thoughts
[17:08] of how the scripture should be fulfilled
[17:10] but God looked at Mary in her
[17:13] Simplicity and knew that she would
[17:15] believe him and take his word there's
[17:19] such a beautiful uh uh just such a
[17:21] beautiful point in that and she was
[17:23] highly favored because her life proved
[17:25] that she love loved God what was she a
[17:28] common ordinary person that God chose to
[17:31] do something extra extraordinary in her
[17:34] life you got to put yourself in those
[17:37] shoes this morning saints of God God is
[17:40] using you to close out the end of the
[17:44] final age he is using people he's using
[17:46] men and women who are willing to stand
[17:49] upon God's word no matter how ridiculous
[17:51] the world thinks you are no matter how
[17:53] unusual it seems or how crazy he's using
[17:56] Believers to take to take him at his
[17:58] word
[17:59] amen and that's God's plan you know many
[18:01] times I I think in in looking at the
[18:04] scriptures and we can use types and
[18:06] shadows and things to address certain
[18:07] things in this particular case between
[18:09] Mary and Joseph I think sometimes we as
[18:12] Believers can fall into Mary shoes and
[18:14] also into Joseph's shoes amen you know
[18:17] God wants us to be like Mary be it unto
[18:19] me according to his word um willing to
[18:22] surrender and accept and Obey no matter
[18:25] how impossible it seems amen that's
[18:27] Faith right just totally accepting and
[18:29] believing on the basis of God's word
[18:32] alone you know that and that it had
[18:34] never happened before in history it
[18:36] would never happened before it would
[18:38] never happen again but she believed it
[18:41] amen that's uh for healing for salvation
[18:44] for your prodal believe it because
[18:47] that's God's word right and and but
[18:50] sometimes I feel like we can get into
[18:53] like what how Joseph how how Joseph was
[18:56] and brother brand or yeah brother
[18:57] brandom expounds further he says how
[18:59] could this virgin conceive brother bam
[19:01] says he was honest and he sought God
[19:04] about it catch it he was honest and he
[19:08] sought God about it he wasn't quick to
[19:10] throw Mary to the curb he wasn't quick
[19:13] to go out and tell all of his friends
[19:15] and and try to get advice from everybody
[19:17] but God but what did he do he was honest
[19:21] and he sought God what a Les lesson in
[19:23] that how many how often times could we
[19:25] save ourselves from confusion and chaos
[19:28] if we were just honest and we sought God
[19:32] about a situation we sought God about it
[19:35] honesty wasn't trying to prove anything
[19:37] to anybody Joseph wasn't trying to prove
[19:40] anything to anybody honesty was Joseph's
[19:43] heart being opened up to this situation
[19:47] in his life honesty was just being
[19:50] totally transparent with God Amen God I
[19:53] simply need you on this and I love how
[19:55] the in the Bible another story in the
[19:57] Bible when that man comes to Jesus he
[20:00] had already taken his child to his
[20:02] disciples to be prayed for and they
[20:04] couldn't cast The Devil out so he sought
[20:07] Jesus and Jesus said if you can only
[20:10] believe all things are possible all
[20:12] things so he sought Jesus and he and he
[20:15] said that and he lifted up his hands and
[20:17] his first statement was said Lord I
[20:19] believe and his second was help thou my
[20:22] unbelief look at the surrender there
[20:24] Lord I believe it I you know I believe
[20:26] it because I brought my I brought my
[20:28] child your disciples now I'm bringing it
[20:30] to now I'm bringing it to you I believe
[20:31] it but obviously there's hindrances in
[20:34] my mind and I there's things I can't get
[20:35] out of it but Lord I surrender to that I
[20:38] give it to you help thou my unbelief and
[20:40] Jesus met that Faith right there and he
[20:43] said thy son is made whole and he cast
[20:45] that Spirit
[20:46] out he didn't that man didn't want
[20:49] anything to hinder the moving of God in
[20:52] that situation especially himself
[20:54] sometimes we allow ourselves in our
[20:56] thought processes because we're in this
[20:58] bubble of our own selves and our own
[21:00] human nature to hinder the moving of God
[21:03] God does the unusual things he it's
[21:06] that's how God works that's how he's
[21:08] always going to work that's how he's
[21:09] always worked he's going to do unusual
[21:11] things and it sometimes isn't going to
[21:13] fit into our mental conception of how it
[21:15] should be done but it's going to be done
[21:17] amen he was honest and he sought God
[21:21] moving on in that quote brother Brom
[21:22] says and then God spoke to him in a
[21:24] dream and said Joseph thou son of David
[21:27] fear not to unto thee Mary thy wife we
[21:29] read this for that which is conceived in
[21:31] her is of the Holy Spirit God had
[21:33] foreshadowed her that's what's done it
[21:35] and he said did you ever notice how God
[21:37] dealt with Joseph there in a secondary
[21:40] way in the way of a dream now we know
[21:42] there's dreams and we believe in dreams
[21:44] he says I Believe In Dreams God's always
[21:46] dealt with people in dreams excuse me
[21:48] but dreams is secondarily see it could
[21:51] be right or wrong unless it's
[21:53] interpreted but he didn't need any
[21:56] interpretation it was God himself speak
[21:58] speaking directly to Joseph because
[22:00] there wasn't a prophet in the land in
[22:02] the in that time to interpret there
[22:05] there hadn't been a prophet in 400 years
[22:07] so the next best thing that God cared
[22:08] for the welfare of his own son was to
[22:11] speak to Joseph through a dream and
[22:13] without interpretation and he said the
[22:15] woman is right that Holy thing which is
[22:18] conceived of her is of the Son of God is
[22:21] the Son of God didn't need any
[22:24] interpretation and he says just
[22:25] finishing the quote he says God does his
[22:28] own interpreting to honest sincere
[22:32] Hearts men and women that looks upon the
[22:35] thing that's mysterious if you're honest
[22:38] and sincere and will believe God has a
[22:42] way of interpreting it to
[22:45] you amen God has a way of interpreting
[22:48] it to you if you're honest and you're
[22:51] sincere and brother vom says first find
[22:53] out if it's a promise if you have a need
[22:55] if you have anything in your life find
[22:57] out that's what that's what the common
[22:59] thing is to do to read the scripture
[23:01] that's why we read the Bible find out if
[23:03] it's a promise find out where the
[23:04] promise is find up and down look up and
[23:06] down scriptures quotes everything find
[23:08] out if it's a promise if Joseph would
[23:10] have just went back brother randam said
[23:12] and got away from the traditions and
[23:15] away from all of the thing and went back
[23:16] to the Bible and find out Isaiah said
[23:20] that she was going to do that amen first
[23:23] find out if it's a promise how do you do
[23:25] that John 5 search the scriptures for
[23:28] them you think you have eternal life but
[23:30] they are they which testify of me if you
[23:32] are not willing to come to me so that
[23:34] you have that you may have life God will
[23:37] interpret his word to you and he is more
[23:39] than able and more than willing to
[23:41] reveal himself to us in a more personal
[23:44] way aren't you glad for that I'm so glad
[23:46] for that
[23:48] amen I know I know we've all heard it
[23:50] before but you are highly favored amen
[23:53] you are highly favored fear not little
[23:56] flock for it is the Father's good
[23:57] pleasure to to give you the kingdom he
[24:00] will fulfill scriptures in your life he
[24:03] will fulfill scriptures in my life he
[24:05] ordained it to happen his scripture said
[24:08] it would be so it will happen amen we we
[24:11] can't underestimate the the power of God
[24:13] moving in and through our lives because
[24:16] he takes the ordinary common right he
[24:20] takes us and then he does the
[24:21] extraordinary it's not us there's
[24:23] nothing about us but it's God working in
[24:25] us and through US amen
[24:29] he go he does his own interpreting to
[24:31] honest sincere hearts and I wanted to
[24:33] end on this going back to that quote you
[24:36] know it's it's against the systematics
[24:38] of the world because they've got the
[24:40] things the way that they think it should
[24:42] be but God comes in and does the unusual
[24:45] you know he'll he'll do the unusual
[24:48] things in our life and his outcome is
[24:51] always perfect amen if we can just
[24:54] remember that God's outcome is always
[24:56] perfect because he sees the end and the
[24:58] beginning he sees the middle all of it
[25:01] amen if we can get our own thoughts out
[25:03] of the way and step on the level of his
[25:05] thoughts and you know the only way to do
[25:08] that is just to have simple faith in
[25:12] God's word and this story had so
[25:14] inspired me because you know so often
[25:16] times I think we can look in I can look
[25:17] at myself look at my life wonder how
[25:20] could God use me or or use you know use
[25:22] me to do anything for him but God looks
[25:25] at you from a different Viewpoint amen
[25:28] God looks at us from a different
[25:30] Viewpoint he's looking at us like he was
[25:32] looking at Mary common ordinary yet
[25:35] Majestic and incredible because she was
[25:37] unusual because she took his she took
[25:40] God's word she believed when it seemed
[25:42] silly and impossible when she didn't
[25:44] have status or eloquent eloquent you
[25:48] know spiritual gifts or anything that
[25:50] wasn't what God was looking for Wow and
[25:53] it brings it brings a whole new meaning
[25:56] to the com things like what I talked
[25:59] about at the beginning like reading the
[26:01] word every day like listening to
[26:03] messages from God's Prophet with
[26:05] fervency with zealousness having having
[26:08] I for me I I like having structure
[26:11] however it works for you but having
[26:13] having a zealousness about it searching
[26:15] out the scriptures in them you'll find
[26:17] life
[26:18] amen first find out if it's a promise
[26:21] amen we are making ourselves ready for
[26:25] the marriage supper of the Lamb I just
[26:27] want to read those two scriptures it

[26:32] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[26:34] marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[26:37] wife hath made herself ready amen

[26:42] for they see and your ears for they hear
[26:44] for verily I say unto you that many
[26:46] prophets and righteous men have desired
[26:48] to see the things which you see and have
[26:50] not seen them and to hear those things
[26:53] which ye hear and have not heard them
[26:56] amen isn't that a wonderful thing yes
