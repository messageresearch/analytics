[1:45] amen first john chapter four if you have
[1:47] your bible
[1:48] and then we'll go to what we read last
[1:51] sunday
[1:52] we just want to continue this on part
[1:55] two
[1:56] of the antichrist spirit at work
[1:59] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[2:02] the spirits whether they are of god
[2:05] because many false prophets are gone out
[2:08] into the world
[2:10] hereby know you the spirit of god
[2:13] every spirit that confesseth that jesus
[2:16] christ has come in the flesh
[2:18] is of god and every spirit that
[2:20] confesses not
[2:21] that jesus christ has come in the flesh
[2:23] is not of god
[2:24] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[2:29] whereof you have heard that it should
[2:31] come and
[2:32] even now already is in the world
[2:36] you are of god little children and have
[2:38] overcome them because
[2:40] greater is he that is in you than he
[2:42] that is in the world you can be seated
[2:44] this morning
[2:45] we took a lot of time last sunday and
[2:47] we'll just get straight to it
[2:49] to lay a foundation we ended on some
[2:52] quotations of
[2:54] god's prophet speaking about the
[2:57] antichrist spirit how that is
[2:59] it is a religious spirit
[3:02] we took a lot of time to show you that
[3:04] it is
[3:06] more of the interest of the devil and
[3:08] his schemes and his plans
[3:11] and he is more interested in corrupting
[3:14] true
[3:14] faith than trying to get you to reject
[3:17] faith
[3:18] altogether it's interesting because the
[3:21] scripture that we read here and i'm just
[3:22] going to cover
[3:23] some of this as as
[3:26] review that we just for a minute here
[3:30] we talked about the antichrist spirit
[3:32] that the bible says
[3:34] as we read in first john this is that
[3:37] spirit
[3:38] of antichrist so we know that it's a
[3:40] spirit
[3:41] we know that the he says whereby you
[3:44] should try the spirits discern the
[3:46] spirits
[3:47] see if they be of god or not and
[3:50] i believe more than ever before in the
[3:53] day and age that we live in
[3:55] we should be discerning spirits
[3:58] and discerning spirits sometimes you
[4:01] don't
[4:02] uh to discern us the spirit of something
[4:05] you don't look at necessarily what you
[4:07] see
[4:08] with your two eyes or here with your two
[4:10] ears
[4:12] but we're prayerful and we approach
[4:14] things with great prayer
[4:16] and soberness of mind and every decision
[4:18] that we make
[4:19] in life should be approached
[4:21] understanding
[4:23] that we live in a multi-dimensional
[4:26] world
[4:27] where everything has a spirit
[4:30] everything has a spirit and something
[4:33] may look harmless completely to you
[4:35] maybe from the outside it looks
[4:37] completely harmless but everything
[4:39] carries with it
[4:40] a spirit of something and it doesn't
[4:43] matter in what category we're speaking
[4:46] of
[4:46] everything carries spirits that's why we
[4:49] look at certain things and we say well
[4:51] you know even even for you know for
[4:53] ourselves we
[4:55] that's what the apostle paul is speaking
[4:56] of here when he says
[4:58] try the spirits see if they be of god or
[5:00] not
[5:01] so he says here in first john 3 4 3
[5:04] this is that spirit of antichrist where
[5:06] if you have heard that it should come
[5:09] and even now already is in
[5:12] the world so john says you've heard of
[5:16] that
[5:16] spirit you've heard it mentioned it's
[5:19] been preached it's been taught
[5:21] and you are expecting its arrival but
[5:25] wake up it's already here
[5:28] and this is in effect what he's saying
[5:30] here that what you've heard of that's
[5:32] coming
[5:33] is already here and it's already at
[5:39] work in other words that spirit is not
[5:42] going to we think of the antichrist and
[5:45] we think oh
[5:46] it's going to be a person you know in
[5:47] the in the in the after
[5:49] in the tribulation period they're going
[5:50] to crown a you know a uh
[5:52] there's going to be a person who disease
[5:54] deceives the entire world
[5:56] and and and that's true well that has a
[5:58] connotation in the context that's true
[6:01] we have to also understand that the
[6:03] spirit that will
[6:04] in that person will as christ was god
[6:08] incarnate
[6:09] and that man will become satan incarnate
[6:13] but yet that spirit as the holy spirit
[6:16] influences
[6:17] god's people today the antichrist spirit
[6:20] influences the children
[6:22] of the devil
[6:25] and the bible calls them the children of
[6:28] disobedience
[6:30] what we what we took time last sunday
[6:32] showing you
[6:33] is that the antichrist
[6:36] spirit is a religious spirit
[6:40] it's a church spirit it's exactly what
[6:43] satan his ambition was
[6:45] in the beginning was to have a church
[6:46] i'm going to show you something very
[6:48] interesting
[6:48] that'll help your mind when you think of
[6:51] the antichrist
[6:52] when you think of that word antichrist
[6:56] what is the first thing and i want
[6:57] someone to say it if you want to speak
[6:59] out
[6:59] go ahead and say it what's the first
[7:01] thing that you think of when you think
[7:03] of what does
[7:04] antichrist mean against christ
[7:07] now that i would think that's the first
[7:10] that is the
[7:10] first and those of you online probably
[7:13] thought the same exact thing that's the
[7:14] first thing you think of
[7:16] when you think of antichrist but let's
[7:20] look at a little bit closer here
[7:22] and look here in first john 4 in your
[7:24] bible again
[7:26] he says verse 3 in every spirit
[7:31] uh that confesseth not let me make sure
[7:34] i'm in
[7:34] right yes that jesus christ has come in
[7:37] the flesh is not of god
[7:39] he says and this is that spirit of
[7:42] antichrist where a view of heard should
[7:44] come and even now is already in the
[7:45] world
[7:46] that word antichrist is strong's number
[7:51] 500 this is the greek lexicon
[7:54] and it's a transliterated word
[7:58] called anti-christos so it's
[8:01] transliterated but it's
[8:03] root the word anti when he speaks of
[8:05] anti the root of that word is strong's
[8:08] number 473
[8:10] which gives it a completely different
[8:12] meaning in your mind
[8:14] and actually when the bible speaks of
[8:16] the antichrist spirit
[8:18] it doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't
[8:21] necessarily only mean
[8:24] a spirit against christ but it actually
[8:27] means instead of christ
[8:32] now think about this just for a moment
[8:35] that
[8:35] antichrist spirit that we speak of
[8:38] we could say what does antichrist mean
[8:41] it means to be against christ well
[8:44] not necessarily what it actually a more
[8:47] proper
[8:47] understanding of what it means when we
[8:49] say antichrist
[8:51] is instead of christ
[8:55] or let me go a little bit clearer in
[8:58] place
[8:58] of christ this is actually
[9:02] strong's 473 it means for instead of
[9:05] or in place of something
[9:10] now that brings on an entire other
[9:12] meaning that when
[9:14] what is the antichrist spirit at work
[9:17] in the world and in churches and in
[9:20] religion today
[9:22] it's not a spirit that's against christ
[9:25] it's a spirit that's instead of christ
[9:29] or in place
[9:33] of christ you could think of
[9:36] the pope what is he instead of that that
[9:39] pope is
[9:40] instead of christ it's a mediator
[9:43] between
[9:44] christ and man but this spirit
[9:47] speaking of is a religious spirit it
[9:50] means to be
[9:51] instead of christ or in
[9:55] place of or a religious system
[9:58] that would replace true faith
[10:04] turn uh if you could actually if you
[10:05] could turn that power point on here just
[10:07] for a moment i want to just read some of
[10:09] these
[10:10] uh quotes let me make sure that's where
[10:13] i want to go
[10:14] now listen to what brother branham says
[10:18] here
[10:18] and i think i got the clicker on now
[10:21] good
[10:22] this is why we are not a denomination
[10:26] now here is your shocking point you say
[10:29] well you ain't hitting me now brother
[10:31] brandon before
[10:32] this quote spends a lot of time to speak
[10:34] about
[10:35] the antichrist spirit or the mother
[10:38] harlot
[10:38] spoken of in the book of revelations and
[10:41] maybe we'll just take a time just time
[10:43] just to read that
[10:44] in revelations chapter 17. if you have
[10:47] your bible
[10:48] you can turn there i'd like you to turn
[10:50] if you have revelation 17
[10:52] brother mark if you want you could take
[10:54] that down and put it up or brother
[10:55] matthew
[10:56] uh if you wanted to revelation 17
[10:59] verse 1. and this is a lot of review for
[11:01] a lot of people
[11:02] but i believe it's good to go back and
[11:04] touch on some of these things that
[11:06] that we we believe revelations chapter
[11:09] 17
[11:11] and you'll find this in revelations the
[11:14] 17th
[11:14] and the 18th chapter where it
[11:18] speaks about a great
[11:21] mystery babylon the mother of harlots
[11:23] you'll read those words
[11:25] in revelation 17 and 18
[11:28] and that mother harlot uh
[11:32] is identified also as the mother
[11:35] of abominations and she is the
[11:39] direct enemy in opposition to christ
[11:43] and we know exactly who it is because
[11:46] all of us would say who is that great
[11:48] that's that it speaks about that
[11:50] sitteth off the many waters
[11:51] it's the catholic church we're not going
[11:53] to take time to
[11:54] to teach on that this morning as i
[11:56] believe that's rudimentary for all of us
[11:58] but
[11:59] we want to just draw out some of these
[12:01] things that we um
[12:03] that we already know so it identifies
[12:05] her this great
[12:07] mother harlot and it speaks about
[12:10] her uh as part of a system and look at
[12:13] revelations chapter 17
[12:16] and uh we'll just begin reading with
[12:18] verse one and there came one of the
[12:19] seven angels
[12:21] which had the seven vials and talked
[12:23] with me saying unto me come come hither
[12:26] i will show unto thee the judgment of
[12:28] the great
[12:30] that sitteth upon many waters
[12:33] with whom the kings of the earth
[12:36] have committed fornication and the
[12:39] inhabitants of the earth have been made
[12:42] drunk
[12:42] with the wine of her fornication
[12:46] so what was her fornication
[12:49] when we speak about that now brother
[12:51] branham said her fornication
[12:53] was in that she labeled herself
[12:58] as the seed of christ that she called
[13:01] herself
[13:02] the seed of god but her life or her
[13:06] or what she actually was was
[13:08] hypocritical
[13:09] that she didn't stand the word test and
[13:12] so
[13:13] because of that not just her doctrine
[13:15] but that was
[13:16] fornication and the inhabitants of the
[13:19] earth had been made
[13:20] drunk with the wine of her fornication
[13:23] so he carried me away in the spirit of
[13:25] the wilderness and i saw a woman
[13:28] sit upon a scarlet colored beast full of
[13:31] names of blasphemy
[13:32] having seven head heads and ten horns
[13:37] and the woman was arrayed in purple and
[13:39] scarlet color
[13:41] and decked with gold and precious stones
[13:43] and pearls
[13:44] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[13:46] abominations and filthiness
[13:49] of her fornication and upon her forehead
[13:54] was the name written mystery babylon
[13:57] now why is it a mystery what is a
[13:59] mystery
[14:01] something previous previously hidden
[14:05] what's a revealed mystery something
[14:07] previously hidden
[14:09] now made known so it was a mystery but
[14:13] it's not a mystery anymore
[14:15] sometimes we look at these things in
[14:17] revelations and our mind just goes
[14:19] what does this mean and what is these
[14:21] symbols well if you go and pick up your
[14:23] church age book
[14:24] a lot of this becomes so crystal clear
[14:28] and a lot of the reason let me just say
[14:30] this and i don't mean this
[14:32] uh in any way as a strike or a
[14:35] uh a chastisement i mean it is an
[14:38] admonishment
[14:39] a lot of the reason why believers
[14:42] believers
[14:43] message believers get uncomfortable when
[14:47] you start talking about these things
[14:48] they're not uncomfortable in the sense
[14:49] that they don't want to hear it but they
[14:50] feel lost what does this mean they don't
[14:52] get it
[14:53] that's that's that's due to the fact
[14:55] that message believers are unlearned
[14:58] or they haven't spent time reading the
[15:01] church age book
[15:03] or the message of the hour that's really
[15:07] what it boils down to is the reason why
[15:09] you don't understand these things is
[15:10] because
[15:11] you we're not doing our diligent thing
[15:13] that we should as sons and daughters of
[15:15] god
[15:15] and we're not studying these things
[15:17] because if you open your church age book
[15:20] this would just be
[15:21] elementary to you and for some it is
[15:24] thankfully but i encourage you
[15:26] if some of these things that we read and
[15:27] you you don't connect the dots and i
[15:29] know you don't get them they don't
[15:30] always
[15:31] i have to go back and look at things uh
[15:34] myself to refresh myself
[15:36] but these things should be knowledge
[15:38] they should be easily
[15:39] knowledgeable to our young people to our
[15:42] old people to all of us
[15:45] so he says the name was written mystery
[15:47] babylon the great mother of harlots
[15:50] and the abominations of the earth
[15:54] and i saw the woman drunken with the
[15:56] blood of the saints
[15:57] and with the blood of the martyrs of
[15:59] jesus and when i saw her
[16:01] i wondered with great admiration and
[16:03] here is the mind which hath wisdom verse
[16:06] nine
[16:06] the seven heads are seven mountains on
[16:08] which the woman sitteth
[16:10] verse 15 and he said unto me the waters
[16:13] which thou
[16:14] sawest uh and he said to me the waters
[16:17] which i saw
[16:18] where the horse sitteth and peoples of
[16:19] multitudes and nations and tongues
[16:21] and the woman which the sauce is the
[16:23] great city which reigneth over the kings
[16:25] of the earth so now we know
[16:28] clearly we're clearly taught that what
[16:31] it's speaking of
[16:32] is the roman catholic church and
[16:36] and how that system would deceive the
[16:39] rest of the world so we
[16:41] can identify who the mother harlot is
[16:44] but now
[16:45] let's go a little bit further because
[16:46] she's a mother so a mother
[16:49] how does someone become a mother you
[16:51] have children
[16:52] and the bible speaks of her daughters
[16:56] and the kings of the earth so not just
[16:59] churches but the entire
[17:01] world with whom verse 7 let's look at
[17:04] verse 2 again what we just quoted there
[17:11] so that vatican the great that
[17:13] great city which is who it's speaking of
[17:16] uh is a religious system as we said it's
[17:20] religious it's church it's not something
[17:23] out disconnected way off into voodoo or
[17:25] witchcraft
[17:27] but that spirit is a religious spirit it
[17:29] loves to worship god
[17:30] it's mass producing music you can find
[17:33] on youtube
[17:34] under the under the genre christian
[17:37] that system that great harlot
[17:40] and her daughters is producing christian
[17:44] music and christian churches
[17:47] so what does that mean brother matt now
[17:49] you know why first john 4 says
[17:52] try the spirits
[17:55] see whether they be of god or not let me
[17:58] just stop here and say this to our young
[18:00] people and to all of us don't just
[18:02] listen to any music
[18:03] that's under the genre of christian
[18:05] music what if that music you're
[18:07] listening to
[18:08] is part of the antichrist system
[18:12] and you're being influenced i'm being
[18:14] influenced by listening to it
[18:15] that's why we try the spirits
[18:19] amen we don't just gobble anything down
[18:23] what did brother adams teach us to do
[18:25] give it the word test
[18:28] amen can i hear a hearty amen
[18:31] didn't lose you did that give it the
[18:33] word test
[18:34] don't just gobble it down don't just
[18:36] take it in we don't just
[18:38] we don't just take any any this isn't a
[18:40] free-for-all and a free and
[18:42] grab-and-go we don't believe in
[18:44] grab-and-go uh spiritual food
[18:46] we don't just grab it and go you know
[18:48] like they have sandwiches at the airport
[18:50] you just grab it and go you don't even
[18:51] look you just pay for it go get on the
[18:53] plane you got something to eat
[18:54] that's not how we treat our spiritual
[18:56] appetite because our spiritual
[18:58] well-being is important to us
[19:01] so we we try the spirits we
[19:04] see whether they be of god or not this
[19:07] system is producing
[19:08] christianity the system is producing
[19:12] church entity it's producing under the
[19:15] auspices and under the title
[19:17] of christianity so it's the vatican that
[19:20] great
[19:21] mother harlot that deceives the
[19:23] world
[19:25] and those many waters refer to the
[19:27] nations of the world
[19:28] the worldwide church religious
[19:32] system of false religion that whether
[19:35] they realize it or not is controlled by
[19:37] one city but it covers the entire earth
[19:42] that roman catholic system catholicism
[19:45] touches
[19:46] all of the entire earth
[19:50] look at verse 2 of revelation 17 with
[19:53] whom the kings of the earth have
[19:55] committed fornication
[19:57] and the inhabitants of the earth have
[19:58] been made drunk
[20:00] with the wine of her fornication
[20:04] so religious fornication is
[20:07] what the term that god uses listen to
[20:10] this very closely because it's gonna
[20:12] light bulbs gonna uh your you should
[20:14] have a moment here where you go aha
[20:17] so religious fornication is the term god
[20:19] uses for
[20:21] any anybody any system any person
[20:25] that claims to be a christian but in
[20:27] reality
[20:28] is not
[20:32] in reality you're not sold unto christ
[20:35] but you're giving yourself to other
[20:37] things
[20:37] so that woman that it speaks of verse
[20:40] 3 if we could read that so he carried me
[20:43] way away in the spirit into the
[20:45] wilderness
[20:46] and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet
[20:48] colored beast
[20:50] full of names of blasphemy now remember
[20:54] the sermon brother branham preached
[20:56] blasphemous names
[20:59] if i trust as your message believer
[21:01] you've heard that
[21:02] blasphemous names and brother branham
[21:04] says what made them names of blasphemy
[21:08] is that they called themselves it's what
[21:11] they
[21:11] labeled themselves and brother adam says
[21:14] that they said we're the church of god
[21:16] so god said okay well then i'll
[21:18] judge you as your confession as what you
[21:20] confess
[21:21] they'd have been better off to say you
[21:23] know not not you
[21:24] you don't receive judgment when you
[21:26] don't claim to be something that you're
[21:27] not
[21:28] but when you attach yourself to the name
[21:30] of christ then brother bannon said then
[21:32] god
[21:32] judges you as what you say that you are.
[21:37] and so that woman uh this speaking here
[21:40] that scarlet
[21:41] beast the bible says she sits upon a
[21:44] colored scarlet colored beast
[21:46] that scarlet beast speaks of the power
[21:49] of
[21:49] you of the uniting power of governments
[21:52] and churches and world systems
[21:55] that will eventually that will
[21:57] eventually be
[21:58] under the rule of one person
[22:02] one satanic person when he's when he's
[22:04] the satan
[22:05] incarnate in a false prophet but that's
[22:09] then this is now and
[22:12] now we don't have it in a flesh and
[22:14] blood
[22:15] body of the false prophet now we have it
[22:18] in a spiritual
[22:20] realm and it trickles down
[22:24] into the entire world in the entire
[22:26] church world and christian
[22:28] so-called christian system that spirit
[22:32] that is
[22:33] already at work remember what does the
[22:35] antichrist mean
[22:37] not necessarily against christ though he
[22:40] is against christ
[22:41] but it's instead of christ
[22:45] or in place of or replacing
[22:50] anything that replaces true
[22:54] apostolic faith and replaces it with
[22:58] anything else is an antichrist spirit
[23:03] let's say that again anything that
[23:05] replaces
[23:06] an apostolic experience or apostolic
[23:09] faith which was the true church in the
[23:12] beginning
[23:13] and replaces it with believing
[23:15] confessing
[23:16] sinners prayers shaking the preachers
[23:19] hands
[23:20] putting your names on a book is an
[23:22] antichrist spirit
[23:24] anything that would replace the
[23:26] apostolic experience
[23:29] by the baptism of the holy ghost in a
[23:32] believer
[23:32] as making that believer born again if
[23:34] you call it anything
[23:36] else as an antichrist spirit
[23:39] so i'll go further than that even a
[23:42] doctrine that would say
[23:44] you just have to believe the message is
[23:46] an antichrist spirit
[23:48] you just believe the word for your day
[23:50] that's if if it's said in a context of
[23:53] you just
[23:54] mentally agree with a prophet and a
[23:56] message
[23:57] that's an antichrist spirit because
[24:00] anything that replaces
[24:02] the new birth as being the as being an
[24:05] apostolic experience by the baptism of
[24:08] the holy ghost
[24:08] where a person is regenerated and
[24:10] changed from their old carnal nature
[24:12] to the new nature that comes through
[24:14] christ is an antichrist spirit
[24:18] amen he says here
[24:22] and the woman was arrayed in purple
[24:24] verse four the woman was arrayed in
[24:26] purple
[24:26] and scarlet color and decked with gold
[24:28] and precious stones and pearls
[24:30] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[24:32] abominations and filthiness of
[24:35] her fornication so we know who this is
[24:37] we know that who's speaking at verse
[24:39] five
[24:40] and upon her forehead was the name
[24:41] written mystery babylon the great
[24:44] the mother the mother
[24:47] so she has daughters it's not just the
[24:49] roman catholic church but it's all the
[24:51] denominational
[24:53] denominations or so to stop there and
[24:55] say it's
[24:56] all the denominations who are her
[24:58] daughters
[25:00] he says the mother of harlots and
[25:02] abominations
[25:04] of the earth so who is mit why does it
[25:06] say mystery because it was hidden
[25:08] before you didn't realize who it was but
[25:11] now we do
[25:12] and it's a organized religion it's an
[25:16] organized
[25:16] false system in a false religion
[25:20] and verse 6 and i saw the woman drunken
[25:22] with the blood of the saints and the
[25:23] blood of the martyrs of jesus and when i
[25:25] saw her
[25:26] i wondered with great admiration now
[25:29] let's get to our quotes if we could
[25:30] brother mark before we run out of time
[25:32] here
[25:32] as i'm not the song leader today so i
[25:34] gotta i got to be real good about my
[25:36] time
[25:37] let's look at these this is this is why
[25:39] we are not a denomination
[25:41] in 1958 now here is your shocking point
[25:45] you say well you ain't hitting me now
[25:47] this is brother random saying
[25:48] you're talking about the roman catholic
[25:49] church and you're talking about
[25:51] catholicism brother matt we're not
[25:53] catholics here
[25:55] are we we're not in we're not affected
[25:59] by catholicism
[26:00] are we not well you ain't hitting me
[26:03] brother brandon but let me just
[26:05] ask you something let's go right back
[26:07] now to the fifth
[26:08] verse and upon her
[26:11] head was written mystery babylon the
[26:14] great mother of abominations the mother
[26:16] of harlots
[26:17] and the abominations of of the earth
[26:21] what was she
[26:24] and she was a mother
[26:28] what mother she had begotten
[26:32] something please pay close attention a
[26:34] mother of
[26:35] sons of harlots what is a harlot
[26:39] same thing as a immoral woman
[26:42] what made her immoral
[26:46] her doctrine it's what she believes
[26:50] she was pretending to be a christian
[26:53] church
[26:54] but was giving out a man-made dogma
[26:57] and here she says that she had if she
[27:00] was the first
[27:01] organization then seems like there's
[27:03] some organizations come
[27:05] out of her she was the mother of harlots
[27:07] is that right
[27:09] a mother of harlots could it be a mother
[27:11] now of
[27:12] boys could it be a mother of it had to
[27:15] be
[27:16] a mother of women and if they were women
[27:20] they were churches
[27:25] so out of that system
[27:28] comes churches daughters
[27:32] what was the first organism now you see
[27:34] why the title of that message is why we
[27:36] are not a denomination
[27:38] what was the first organization catholic
[27:40] church
[27:41] what was the second organization luther
[27:44] what was the third
[27:45] organization's wiggly what he and
[27:47] brother anne's just listing here the
[27:49] beginning of denominational churches
[27:52] would it come on down to calvin and
[27:54] they're coming to angelico now remember
[27:56] it's not the people we're not against
[27:58] the people
[27:59] let me just say this here for a moment
[28:01] we don't identify
[28:02] people we identify spirits john 1
[28:05] john 4 said he didn't say try the people
[28:09] to see whether they be of god or not and
[28:11] that's the reason we get into so much
[28:13] trouble when so much schism comes in the
[28:15] body is that we don't discern the spirit
[28:17] we discern the people
[28:20] and that could be your brother or your
[28:22] sister
[28:23] you say let me let me let me just give
[28:25] you the most extreme example i don't
[28:27] know whether the pope himself will go to
[28:29] hell
[28:30] i don't know that because the pope's a
[28:33] man he'll stand before
[28:35] a judge a righteous judge and he'll be
[28:38] tried
[28:39] but i don't wish for the pope himself to
[28:42] go to hell
[28:43] because i'm not trying the man the bit
[28:45] that that
[28:46] literal man from another country who
[28:48] don't even know
[28:50] i'm trying the spirit
[28:53] do you follow me we don't wish that
[28:56] anybody would go to hell we don't wish
[28:58] that anybody would be lost we don't look
[29:00] at
[29:00] people at other denominational churches
[29:02] and say they're just a bunch of
[29:03] harlots i've heard that said and i think
[29:05] my goodness have you missed the message
[29:08] completely
[29:09] brother branham never spoke against the
[29:11] people against the people it was against
[29:13] the spirits that they were under
[29:15] amen amen
[29:20] when it come down to calvin they're
[29:22] coming to angelico because these were
[29:23] good people these were good
[29:25] christian people but the system that
[29:27] they were under was a false religious
[29:29] system
[29:30] angelican come on down to methodist the
[29:32] methodist what did the methodist produce
[29:33] just little isms i moved way down to
[29:36] another paragraph so if you go back and
[29:37] read this
[29:38] you'll see i skipped that just little
[29:40] isms running out like that keep
[29:42] running on down each one of them little
[29:44] starters back there
[29:46] come right on down and what did every
[29:48] one of them do and it finally
[29:50] winded up in pentecost now speaking of
[29:53] azusa
[29:54] street pentecost here and what did
[29:56] pentecost do
[29:57] the same thing their mammy did they went
[30:00] right back
[30:01] and organized and what did it become
[30:04] a denomination walk into the first day
[30:08] listen walk into one the first thing
[30:11] what's your doctrine boy they comb you
[30:14] with a fine-toothed comb
[30:15] see to find out what you are what you
[30:18] believe if you don't just tally right up
[30:20] with them brother
[30:21] you're excommunicated right now and
[30:24] that's
[30:24] right and for those of you that think
[30:27] this doesn't exist let me just
[30:28] let me just tell you it does in
[30:30] denominational churches
[30:32] we tried to have just a little small
[30:34] exam we tried to have a little scouts
[30:35] boy scouts uh
[30:36] christian scouts group called trail life
[30:39] i think it was
[30:40] and we wanted to be part of the
[30:41] organization to have a little scouts
[30:43] group for our boys
[30:44] and you know and so we came all the way
[30:46] down to signing up signing the papers
[30:48] uh our pastor was going to sign them but
[30:50] then it came to the document
[30:52] statement of faith and before
[30:55] you could get accepted into the group
[30:57] this is a christian organization
[30:59] we believe and god the father god the
[31:01] son
[31:02] god that god has been revealed in three
[31:04] persons the trinity
[31:05] and unless you agree and sign your name
[31:07] to that you can't be part of that group
[31:11] that's not just in a scouts group that's
[31:12] on every level we
[31:14] we take it for granted you don't realize
[31:17] that spirit as we spoke last sunday that
[31:20] trinity spirit that
[31:21] binds the tares together the baptist may
[31:25] not agree with the methodists and the
[31:26] methodists may not agree with the
[31:27] baptist but there's a unifying spirit
[31:29] called the trinity that binds the tares
[31:32] together
[31:33] and if you don't just tally right up
[31:35] with him brother you're excommunicated
[31:36] right there and that's right
[31:38] and don't think just because you say
[31:39] you're pentecostal that you're secured
[31:41] brother there'll be
[31:42] just as many pentecostals off the road
[31:45] as there is on the road
[31:47] and let me give you let me let me give
[31:48] you brother matt's interpretation and
[31:50] don't just think because you say you're
[31:51] a message believer that you're secured
[31:54] brother there'll be just as many message
[31:55] believers professed off the road
[31:58] as there is on the road now all these
[32:01] organizations if they had just
[32:03] left the pentecostal blessing go and not
[32:06] organize
[32:07] just keep it a brotherhood let the holy
[32:09] spirit do the segregation
[32:11] the holy spirit segregates ananias and
[32:13] sapphira come in one time
[32:15] said so and so and the holy spirit said
[32:18] why did you lie
[32:20] but we say now that's brother jonas
[32:22] don't you say nothing bad about him now
[32:24] he's the biggest payer we got in church
[32:26] i know he got the holy ghost i heard him
[32:28] speak in tongues i've seen him shout in
[32:30] the spirit
[32:30] that don't have no more than pouring
[32:32] peas on a dry dry
[32:34] cowhide see not a thing to do with it
[32:39] god does the same now we're going to
[32:41] close but i use that last example
[32:44] because it's amazing when we think of
[32:46] denominationalism and antichrist spirit
[32:50] then look what brother branham points to
[32:52] how to identify
[32:54] denominationalism when we have when we
[32:57] brother adam says when we don't let the
[32:59] holy ghost
[33:01] do the separating and then we try to do
[33:04] the separating well he's got it and she
[33:06] don't he does because of this and
[33:07] because of that
[33:08] we let the holy ghost do the separating
[33:11] the excommunicating we don't do that
[33:13] ourselves preach the word
[33:16] and the word will do the separating amen
[33:19] let's stand to our feet we're out of
[33:20] time
[33:21] sorry brother tony cut into just a
[33:23] couple minutes there let's just pray
