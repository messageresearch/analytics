[40:10] special thank you to all of you and uh I
[40:13] bring you greetings from Christian
[40:14] Fellowship Tabernacle uh and all the uh
[40:18] all the saints there I think there's a
[40:19] few listening in tonight and um thrilled
[40:22] to be able to go to church with some
[40:24] amazing people uh there in
[40:26] Christiansburg Virginia so excited to
[40:29] them excited that they're listening in
[40:31] and uh good to be
[40:33] here
[40:35] amen you know I was um I was just
[40:38] thinking on the way here this
[40:41] evening uh about just uh what what we do
[40:47] here and to the world this is a very
[40:49] foolish
[40:50] thing uh a bunch of people getting
[40:53] together you have a man standing in
[40:56] spitting for an
[40:58] hour and they drive by in the normal
[41:01] business of life this seems like a very
[41:03] foolish thing and to too uh it is kind
[41:07] of foolish what we do and it's through
[41:09] the foolishness of preaching that the
[41:11] Lord would choose to save those that
[41:12] believe amen and that's the key is that
[41:15] we gather together because we believe
[41:18] and so I ask you this evening if you
[41:19] just pull on the word of God um and uh
[41:23] uh and if you have a need you have
[41:25] something that you want the Lord to
[41:27] speak to just pull on the pull on the
[41:29] presence of the Lord because I believe
[41:31] he's here you believe he's here tonight
[41:33] he promised he would be so we have no
[41:35] other we have no other alternative than
[41:36] to believe that he's here so I believe
[41:39] if he is here he can speak to you
[41:41] directly I absolutely believe that so
[41:43] let's just press into the Lord tonight
[41:46] uh I believe in uh I believe in in in
[41:49] the message of the hour I believe in the
[41:51] Lord Jesus Christ I believe in uh I
[41:54] believe the Lord sent a messenger in
[41:55] this last last day and that message is
[41:59] Christ in me the hope of glory you
[42:00] believe that uh I believe that the
[42:03] message of the hour many times we can
[42:05] over complicate things and to a large
[42:08] degree um when the seventh angel shall
[42:10] begin to sound the mystery should be
[42:12] finished and Christ is the mystery of
[42:13] God revealed and so his coming and who
[42:16] he is in me and who I am in him is is to
[42:20] me that's the message of the hour and I
[42:22] I press fully into the light that Christ
[42:25] has shown to us as Paul says here I I
[42:27] press fully into that and I I um I I
[42:31] believe that and I think I I believe
[42:33] that the next thing to happen is the
[42:36] change of our bodies I really believe
[42:38] that uh and I I believe that until the
[42:42] change of our bodies
[42:44] occurs we are in a period of maturing
[42:47] there's a difference between a growth
[42:48] period And there's a difference between
[42:50] a a period of maturing the stock grows
[42:53] but then ultimately the fruit comes on
[42:55] to the vine and it matures so the fruit
[42:58] matures we're in a maturing season and I
[43:00] I believe that God wants to mature us
[43:03] and I'm so thankful because I believe
[43:05] that God is still working on me when I
[43:08] receive the the baptism of the Holy
[43:10] Spirit that's when my life began and so
[43:13] I believe that he he intends that I
[43:16] would change and that I would
[43:19] grow I believe that the Lord uh intends
[43:23] for there to be progress yeah and
[43:27] progress is an interesting thing I was
[43:29] reading on progress recently and just
[43:31] studying a little bit and it's we would
[43:33] often times we'd think of progress as
[43:35] being a a steady incline when in
[43:38] actuality progress can be a a a bunch of
[43:42] squiggly lines up and down progress
[43:45] doesn't seem like progress all the time
[43:48] even though we are progressing so you
[43:50] may be in a period of decline or
[43:53] seemingly you may be in a period of
[43:55] decline when in actuality you're playing
[43:57] out the course of what progress looks
[43:59] like in your life and it's an amazing
[44:01] thought if if you really take a you look
[44:04] at a forest a forest the whole thing
[44:06] could be burned toi
[44:08] Smither and it's progressing it's just
[44:11] clearing out the the bad stuff and
[44:13] growing and it's the whole thing is
[44:14] burned um we have a local Forest we we
[44:17] we hike in every once in a while and uh
[44:19] there's there's Woods there and they
[44:22] they all burned um and you look at it
[44:26] today and that was years ago and you
[44:27] look at it today and it's beautiful and
[44:29] it's bursting with life so what progress
[44:32] may look what what you think progress
[44:34] may look like often times it's very
[44:36] different than that uh uh assumption
[44:39] progress is simply the the definition of
[44:41] it is forward or onward movement toward
[44:44] a
[44:45] destination so progress is just I'm just
[44:48] I'm moving toward my destination and I
[44:50] believe that we're all moving toward a
[44:52] very expected end a a specific Des
[44:56] ination and along the way as I progress
[45:00] I want to progress
[45:03] well you can choose how you progress to
[45:07] a large degree you have a lot of input
[45:09] and and and uh uh say in how well you
[45:14] progress uh the Lord doesn't um he he
[45:17] doesn't have a an army of robots he has
[45:20] an army of of individuals with the
[45:23] ability to think and to do and to side
[45:26] amen that's that's what free will is the
[45:29] Lord doesn't Force anybody through the
[45:31] uh through the Riven Veil he for
[45:34] ordained and and and called you to stand
[45:37] at Jordan's River but he pushes no one
[45:40] across by your own free will you step
[45:42] across the Riven Veil into the holy of
[45:44] holies you you you chose that uh uh to
[45:48] step fully into Christ amen so he called
[45:51] you to that but you made the decision to
[45:53] cross that Veil and I I believe that he
[45:56] uh along life's road we have choices
[45:59] that's why brother Brandon preached in
[46:01] the time of decision he he he he
[46:03] preached that we have a choice to make
[46:05] it's a it's a it's a a very U um uh
[46:08] important concept for us to understand
[46:10] in 1956 and making a way he says we grow
[46:14] we mature he says we find better things
[46:18] we talk of better things we wear better
[46:20] clothes we drive better automobiles we
[46:23] are progressing but God cannot progress
[46:25] in that way because he was always
[46:27] perfect to begin with so thanks be to
[46:29] God we can change but thanks be to God
[46:33] he doesn't so he doesn't change but you
[46:36] can and I praise God for that every
[46:38] moment of my life because I don't know
[46:40] about you but I don't I'm not perfect as
[46:42] of yet he is my perfection but I'm not
[46:45] perfect as of yet so as I progress I
[46:47] want to progress well and if that means
[46:50] I need to learn how to make better
[46:52] decisions how to uh communicate one to
[46:55] another better how to align myself to
[46:57] the scripture then bring it on because I
[46:59] want to progress well because one thing
[47:02] is for sure progress you
[47:05] will you will change change is
[47:07] inevitable it's the only constant of
[47:09] course you're going to change I have
[47:11] more gray hair than than the last time I
[47:13] was here and you do not so I don't know
[47:17] what's going on but I have a lot of gray
[47:21] hair and the last time I was here I
[47:23] don't think that I had that much right
[47:25] so I am changing like it or or not I
[47:30] want to choose to change and progress
[47:33] and mature
[47:35] well now in In this passage of scripture
[47:39] now I I believe that the Lord wants us
[47:41] to grow um you you you wouldn't want
[47:44] your child to remain a a spoiled child
[47:47] you train them in the way that they
[47:48] should go and thanks be to God he trains
[47:51] us and and and nurtures us and and comes
[47:54] alongside us that's what the the the
[47:56] holy spirit is is one that comes
[47:58] alongside and helps us to grow and
[48:00] mature and then Ephesians chapter 1 in
[48:03] verse uh I believe it's 17 he says and
[48:06] the spirit of wisdom and revelation will
[48:09] work in our midst according to our
[48:11] knowledge of him so we grow in Grace and
[48:14] in knowledge but the spirit of wisdom
[48:16] and of Revelation Works in that midst in
[48:19] in our midst to allow us to grow and
[48:22] progress well and that's why Sons and
[48:24] Daughters of God are led by the spirit
[48:26] of God so as our knowledge of him grows
[48:29] the spirit of wisdom and of Revelation
[48:31] the holy spirit in our midst allows and
[48:33] guides us leads us helps us make those
[48:35] decisions am what an interesting thing
[48:38] what an amazing thing brother Brandon
[48:40] believed in evolution if you ever uh
[48:42] brother Jason actually when a long time
[48:44] ago um in the early 2000s you were in
[48:48] Hickory and you preached on Evolution I
[48:49] was a very very young man at the time
[48:51] and I listened to that and it was the
[48:52] first time I had really understood that
[48:54] concept and I got it and I thought
[48:55] brother Brandon believed in evolution
[48:57] and and obviously we don't believe in
[48:58] evolution um uh we believe in creation
[49:02] and evolution after creation uh but
[49:04] brother Mana believed in that process of
[49:06] change he said you look at a little
[49:08] tadpole and you look at how they're in
[49:09] the in the water and then they grow up
[49:11] and then all of a sudden they become
[49:12] some other thing because they morph they
[49:14] change they grow so we all progress we
[49:16] all grow and uh we do so by the leading
[49:20] of the Holy Spirit you know what I find
[49:22] amazing is that families grow I was
[49:23] looking around at the camp and I am one
[49:26] of the old people when I was a camper I
[49:30] looked around and said those people are
[49:31] old and I was that guy this camp and I'm
[49:35] thinking I'm the one with gray hair I'm
[49:38] the I'm the guy I brought children from
[49:40] my church to this Camp I'm thinking
[49:44] whoa I was not ready for that I had my
[49:46] own little moment uh just apart from
[49:50] everybody families and and churches
[49:53] evolve a church is a living organizm it
[49:55] changes it grows it it contracts it
[49:58] expands it it changes it's nurtured by
[50:00] the leading of the Holy Spirit um your
[50:02] family grows and you you can choose uh
[50:05] to tr to allow your family to grow well
[50:08] you train up in in a child in the way
[50:10] that it goes you you your your family uh
[50:13] your kids all of a sudden are just old
[50:14] and they're moved out uh um you get one
[50:17] you get it figured out when they're
[50:18] young and I'm speaking from my parents
[50:20] perspective to me uh when I was a young
[50:23] child they they thought they had me
[50:24] figured out in I grew up and then I
[50:26] caused different kinds of headaches uh
[50:29] naturally so everybody grows and I think
[50:32] it's this amazing Concept in Philippians
[50:35] chapter 1 being confident of this this
[50:37] very thing that he which began a good
[50:39] work in you will perform it until the
[50:43] day of Jesus
[50:45] Christ we all progress and we progress
[50:49] every
[50:51] moment here in uh Ephesians chapter 5
[50:54] the Apostle Paul he says
[50:57] um that you redeem the time and he uses
[51:01] this phrase and as to my knowledge he
[51:03] only uses this phrase one other time and
[51:05] that's in uh uh the book to the people
[51:07] at coloss um when he says walk in wisdom
[51:10] to them that are without Redeeming the
[51:12] time so he uses this phrase redeem the
[51:15] time but the the Greek phrase time um
[51:18] means it it implies an opportunity so
[51:22] redeem the time it it it it it looks at
[51:25] time as being a moment being an
[51:28] opportunity so redeem the opportunity
[51:31] that you have because you don't have the
[51:33] the the the past you don't have the
[51:36] future you have the present so you have
[51:38] the present moment to decide and to do
[51:40] well and to act and to be God placed You
[51:43] In This Moment he handcrafted this
[51:45] moment and gave it to you this Wednesday
[51:48] night you may look at this as just a
[51:50] normal Wednesday night in your life you
[51:51] may not be feeling well you've got work
[51:53] things all yada yada y you've got all
[51:56] the different things that you're
[51:57] thinking about but this moment was
[51:59] specifically crafted by almighty God for
[52:02] you and it's considered an opportunity
[52:05] what an amazing thing what an amazing
[52:06] concept time is an amazing thing now
[52:10] according to archaeologists and all the
[52:12] research back in the Babylonian and in
[52:14] in in Egyptian time they began to
[52:17] measure time probably 5,000 years ago we
[52:21] think of time and we think just take
[52:22] time for granted you may have not taken
[52:24] the time and thought about time I have
[52:27] and the the Egyptians and the
[52:29] Babylonians began to think about time
[52:31] and how it was created but it was
[52:32] actually far beyond that even in job it
[52:34] says our time on Earth is brief so the
[52:38] the concept of time is has always been
[52:42] uh present for for humans we've always
[52:45] thought of things in terms of of time
[52:48] Joseph uh um even job lived far beyond
[52:52] Joseph and before Moses way back and um
[52:54] when you talk about time you also have
[52:57] to talk about space because the two are
[53:00] relative to to one another am and when
[53:04] the Apostle Paul is saying redeem the
[53:06] time redeem the moment brother bam said
[53:09] this in 1961 in the true Easter seal he
[53:11] says now we just happened to think just
[53:14] watch this just a minute now Einstein
[53:16] proved by scientific that if two objects
[53:19] was coming at each other like two cars
[53:21] coming down from across the road if they
[53:23] were coming fast enough then they'd
[53:24] really have to be going fast like a
[53:26] billion miles per second but they could
[53:29] pass right through one another and never
[53:31] disturb a thing speed would do it pass
[53:34] right through one another without
[53:35] disturbing anything he says now if
[53:38] you'll notice I was standing here not
[53:39] long ago at Mount poar in California and
[53:41] I was noticing that there's a telescope
[53:43] 120 million years of light space and how
[53:46] many miles would be broke down but yet
[53:48] Heaven is so many billions and billions
[53:50] of light years beyond that he says till
[53:52] it's not even a thought of how would we
[53:55] get there it's the travel it'll be like
[53:57] the mind it's so fast it'll be faster I
[54:00] I if you could think of Heaven that's
[54:02] how quick you'd be there Jesus after he
[54:05] was resurrected came right through the
[54:07] walls right through the doors and stood
[54:09] and eat boiled fish and honeycomb
[54:12] Hallelujah he said speed no matter
[54:14] sooner than life has gone out of this
[54:16] body we're in the presence of God Yonder
[54:19] now interestingly brother brandom talks
[54:21] about Einstein because Einstein went so
[54:24] far God had to stop him Einstein uh
[54:28] understood the the the concept of time
[54:31] as it relates to space Einstein thought
[54:34] well naturally if you're going at the
[54:36] speed of light something zooms by you at
[54:38] the speed of light it just goes by you
[54:40] you can barely even see it it's going by
[54:42] at such speed and it's a a measure of
[54:45] time it's going by you in 186,000 ft per
[54:48] second so it's a measure of time and
[54:51] space Einstein said but time is is
[54:55] relative because if you're traveling
[54:57] with the speed of light everything else
[54:59] around it is going by really really fast
[55:02] so it's relative the the perception of
[55:05] time is relative to where you
[55:08] are fascinating isn't it and brother bam
[55:11] says Einstein uh um uh understood all of
[55:15] this and thus the theory of relativity
[55:17] you're relative to where you are so time
[55:20] is just a a um a perception of where you
[55:24] are but we have this idea of what we
[55:27] view time as we came here at 7:00 most
[55:30] of us came here at 7:00 we should have
[55:32] been here at 6:30 though
[55:34] right I can say that because I wasn't in
[55:37] here and I didn't know who got here at
[55:39] 6:30 or 7 and then I can leave tonight
[55:44] so we should be here at 6:30 can I get
[55:45] an amen
[55:49] uh and then uh you know we've got work
[55:53] tomorrow 9:00 we we go we think in terms
[55:56] of time we measure our lives and we look
[55:59] at all these things as as a measure of
[56:01] time now interestingly this the brother
[56:04] bam at the end of this quote he says
[56:06] this we only know as feet and inches and
[56:09] yards and miles and so forth we're in
[56:11] this Earthbound system but when we leave
[56:15] here brother oh my what a Time
[56:18] Hallelujah he says we're in this
[56:20] Earthbound system now the scientific def
[56:23] definition of time if you go and you
[56:25] look at it and what time is time is the
[56:28] indefinite continued progress of
[56:32] existence and events that occur in
[56:34] apparently irreversible succession from
[56:36] past through the present to the Future
[56:40] that's the scientific definition of time
[56:42] it is the indefinite continued progress
[56:45] of events irreversible succession you
[56:48] can't have time back I don't know if you
[56:50] knew that or not but time doesn't you
[56:52] can't stop it you can't buy it it's in
[56:55] short supply you have a set period of
[56:57] time it is irreversible and it is
[57:01] irrevocable so he it's it's irreversible
[57:04] succession from past through the present
[57:07] to the Future that sounds familiar
[57:09] because in Hebrews chapter 138 it says
[57:11] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[57:14] and forever it says in Genesis 1:1 in
[57:17] the beginning God created the heavens
[57:19] and the Earth in Revelations 22 I am the
[57:21] Alpha and the Omega the beginning and
[57:24] the end
[57:25] so the very scientific definition of
[57:28] time relates to who God is almost
[57:31] precisely an amazing thought now the
[57:35] that being said God created time and
[57:41] placed us within it am now the scripture
[57:44] very clearly says in Colossians 1 for in
[57:47] him all things were created things in
[57:49] heaven and in Earth visible and
[57:51] invisible whether Thrones or powers or
[57:53] rulers or authorities all things have
[57:55] been created through him and for him he
[57:59] is before all things and in him all
[58:01] things hold together so he created
[58:05] everything and it was created through
[58:07] him and for him so that would mean that
[58:10] time as we would understand it the
[58:13] succession of events in an irreversible
[58:15] order past present and future was a
[58:18] construct that God himself crafted now
[58:22] the amazing thing is that you and I are
[58:25] finite yeah we we are not uh in our
[58:29] flesh we are not Eternal we are finite
[58:32] meaning that the only context that we
[58:35] have to relate to who God is in is in
[58:38] terms of the beginning and the ending we
[58:41] can't grasp eternity if you try to think
[58:43] about eternity your mind stops because
[58:45] it's finite in other words God crafted
[58:48] this construct called time and then he
[58:51] places you and me within the context of
[58:55] it we can't relate to Eternity we don't
[58:58] have no idea what it means what it is
[58:59] the breadth of it the depth of it we
[59:01] don't understand but we know the
[59:02] beginning and we know the end we know
[59:04] that it's 9:00 and we know that the
[59:05] service is going to end 8:45 and 9:00 we
[59:08] know that the service is going to end at
[59:09] some point we think in terms of time so
[59:13] the only context that we have to relate
[59:15] to the world and to an expected end is
[59:19] the
[59:20] beginning so the only the only context
[59:23] that we have of of Life as we know it is
[59:26] within the context of time a construct
[59:29] that was directly and precisely crafted
[59:32] by almighty God from the beginning to
[59:35] the ending because he is the Alpha and
[59:38] the Omega all things were created
[59:41] through him and for him what an amazing
[59:43] thing now
[59:45] eternity the scientific def definition
[59:48] of Eternity or Eternal is this the
[59:51] continuing forever or indefinitely
[59:55] having no beginning and no end in time
[59:58] lasting forever and existing at all
[1:00:01] times Eternal can also mean always true
[1:00:06] or valid am so we understand it from the
[1:00:10] definition that that eternity always is
[1:00:13] it's always true it's always valid it
[1:00:17] never had a beginning and it never had
[1:00:18] an ending so it it's important and I
[1:00:21] want you to grasp this that God created
[1:00:23] the construct of time and then he placed
[1:00:25] Mankind in it time is is Relentless it's
[1:00:30] irrevocable it's irreversible you never
[1:00:33] get this precise moment back again amen
[1:00:37] think about that for a second and we
[1:00:39] just take Wednesday night for granted
[1:00:42] and this moment was so precisely crafted
[1:00:44] by God he placed you here and every
[1:00:47] single one of us in this room for some
[1:00:49] reason he had uh me here and you there
[1:00:51] and you there and you and we think that
[1:00:53] you know just I just came to church
[1:00:55] brother Steve no this was specially
[1:00:58] crafted by almighty God for a very
[1:01:00] specific purpose because all thing he
[1:01:02] makes all things beautiful in his time
[1:01:06] so within that context that you and I
[1:01:09] relate to he makes everything beautiful
[1:01:12] he works to the to the good pleasure of
[1:01:14] his will within that
[1:01:17] context what an amazing thing now God
[1:01:20] himself is eternal so he exists apart
[1:01:25] from the constraint of time right God
[1:01:29] God is the beginning and he is the
[1:01:31] ending but he never had a beginning and
[1:01:33] he never had an ending but he crafted
[1:01:35] the beginning and the ending So within
[1:01:37] the context he has preeminence he is
[1:01:39] omniscient and omnipresent brother
[1:01:42] brandham said you can't be omnipresent
[1:01:44] without being omniscient so the very
[1:01:46] fact that he is omnipresent is because
[1:01:48] he knew all things that's what forn
[1:01:50] knowledge is he and that's why How Free
[1:01:52] Will and forn knowledge work together a
[1:01:55] lot of people get confused about that
[1:01:56] God just knew what decision you would
[1:01:58] make he's orchestrated all things to the
[1:02:01] working of his good pleasure that he
[1:02:03] gives you the Free Will in the moment to
[1:02:05] make the decision amen what an amazing
[1:02:08] thing amen now here's the other thing
[1:02:11] that I want you to
[1:02:13] understand at the same
[1:02:16] time Satan was created and placed within
[1:02:20] the same construct that you and I are in
[1:02:23] amen
[1:02:25] Satan is a is's a created being right he
[1:02:29] he had a beginning therefore he has an
[1:02:32] ending he in in even in Genesis chapter
[1:02:35] 2 thus the heavens and the Earth were
[1:02:37] finished and the host of them brother
[1:02:40] brandham says in 1962 and why I'm
[1:02:42] against organized religion he says this
[1:02:44] and there's no scripture that says
[1:02:45] there's an eternal hell because Eternal
[1:02:47] never did begin and neither does it
[1:02:49] never end so the Bible hell was created
[1:02:51] for the devil and his angels so it is an
[1:02:54] etal Eternal there was a time when it
[1:02:56] wasn't and there'll be a time when it's
[1:02:58] not again they may be punished in there
[1:03:01] through fire and Brinston and pits and
[1:03:03] fire and eons of time but it finally
[1:03:06] will end because hell is not Eternal and
[1:03:09] if there was an eternal hell you'd have
[1:03:11] eternal life and to live in eternal hell
[1:03:14] and and if if it was eternal it always
[1:03:16] was and you you always was in Hell
[1:03:19] you'll always be in Hell see so there's
[1:03:20] no such a thing he says so you see
[1:03:23] eternal is never had a beginning never
[1:03:26] had an ending there's only one form of
[1:03:28] eternal life and that is God and it
[1:03:30] comes from the Greek word Zoey which
[1:03:32] means God's own life and when we Are
[1:03:34] Born Again by the spirit of God we
[1:03:36] become Eternal with God because we have
[1:03:39] part of his life which makes us Sons and
[1:03:42] Daughters to
[1:03:44] God Satan exists within the same context
[1:03:49] that you
[1:03:50] do now there's a faster Dimension right
[1:03:53] hell is just a a different dimension
[1:03:55] there's it's relative to where you are
[1:03:57] and the dimension that you have there's
[1:03:59] there's a three brother random explained
[1:04:01] the Realms that exist and you exist
[1:04:03] within the the Earth realm and Satan
[1:04:06] exists in a different realm so he's
[1:04:08] traveling with a different perception of
[1:04:10] time it's relative to where he is where
[1:04:13] he is but you are in this context and he
[1:04:16] is in that context but he's restrained
[1:04:18] by the same construct that you are that
[1:04:22] a flesh born person is is and within
[1:04:25] that construct brother bam said that
[1:04:27] Satan absolutely does have power but he
[1:04:30] only has power within that construct
[1:04:33] because his only Power is
[1:04:36] death so his only Power is with death
[1:04:39] that means that he's confined to the
[1:04:41] same constraint that a flesh born person
[1:04:44] is confined by that's why in the
[1:04:47] Millennium he he was he was bound and it
[1:04:50] was a chain of circumstance there's
[1:04:52] literally nothing for him to do it it
[1:04:54] there there is a a a confine that he is
[1:04:57] under and it's the same that we're under
[1:05:00] as individuals as as flesh born
[1:05:02] individuals in all of this world this is
[1:05:04] Satan zeden and he's confined to that
[1:05:07] construct of
[1:05:09] time he had a beginning he will have an
[1:05:12] end now God exists apart from that
[1:05:16] context but Satan is bound by that
[1:05:18] that's why God created time is because
[1:05:21] it has a beginning and it has an end but
[1:05:23] he is eternal so at some point Satan
[1:05:26] exists within that construct of time but
[1:05:29] he absolutely has an ending because he
[1:05:32] had a beginning so Satan is only
[1:05:34] confined Satan is confined by time and
[1:05:38] One Sweet Day time will come to an
[1:05:41] end so I ask you what have we to fear
[1:05:45] what have we to trust I'm leaning on the
[1:05:48] Everlasting Arms do you understand how
[1:05:51] small Satan is he's confined to time and
[1:05:55] one day time is going to be over but the
[1:05:58] beautiful thing about it is is that
[1:06:01] those who are in Christ Jesus have the
[1:06:04] very Life of Christ in them and if you
[1:06:07] are in Christ then you were in him in
[1:06:09] the beginning you are a thought at the
[1:06:12] beginning a thought is a um a word is a
[1:06:15] thought expressed you've heard this
[1:06:16] before you know where I'm going a
[1:06:19] thought a word is a thought expressed so
[1:06:21] if you are in the mind of God then that
[1:06:24] means that you are the word made
[1:06:25] manifest you're the very life of God
[1:06:28] that's the very life of God in you
[1:06:29] because it's the same Word Flesh of his
[1:06:32] flesh and bone of his bone so Paul comes
[1:06:34] along and said I was crucified with
[1:06:35] Christ nevertheless I live I Christ
[1:06:38] lives through me and we look at all
[1:06:40] these different things um even in in the
[1:06:43] uh uh in John in the beginning was the
[1:06:45] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:06:46] word became flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:06:48] Galatians 2:20 I have been crucified
[1:06:50] with Christ John 5:25 verely verely I
[1:06:54] say unto you he that heareth my word and
[1:06:56] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:06:58] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:07:01] condemnation but is passed from Death
[1:07:04] the only the only Power that Satan has
[1:07:06] unto life so you've been passed from
[1:07:09] Death unto life and then he says in 1
[1:07:12] John chapter 5 he says and this is the
[1:07:15] record that God hath given to us eternal
[1:07:19] life and this life is in his son amen
[1:07:24] God gave to you eternal life and do you
[1:07:29] understand that eternity exists outside
[1:07:32] of the constraint of time amen amen so
[1:07:37] do you understand that your adversary
[1:07:39] has an end but you do
[1:07:42] not your adversary's time is allotted to
[1:07:45] him amen he exists within that
[1:07:49] constraint but you as a born again Holy
[1:07:51] Ghost filled believer do not you exist
[1:07:55] outside of that confine although the
[1:07:57] only context that we have is within it
[1:08:00] but thanks be to God he hath opened our
[1:08:02] eyes to be able to see what God has done
[1:08:06] in this last day and what he's done is
[1:08:08] he's given his very life Zoe to you and
[1:08:13] you are a part of him flesh of his flesh
[1:08:15] and bone of his bone meaning that you
[1:08:17] have eternal life in you right now it's
[1:08:21] deity in flesh so you exists outside of
[1:08:25] that context even though you are
[1:08:27] constrained by it amen what an amazing
[1:08:30] thing so I can't stop the aging process
[1:08:35] there's a lot of chemicals there's a lot
[1:08:37] of things that says you can but they
[1:08:39] won't stop it time is irreversible and
[1:08:43] it is irrevocable it is Relentless it
[1:08:46] goes your children will grow up amen
[1:08:50] they will leave the home eventually some
[1:08:52] will some may not
[1:08:54] you will get old rest assured that you
[1:08:58] will change you can't stop it it's
[1:09:02] Relentless change happens progress
[1:09:04] happens there's nothing you can do about
[1:09:06] that because you're confined to that
[1:09:08] restraint but praise be to God that's
[1:09:11] not the end of my story that's not the
[1:09:13] end of your story we exist without that
[1:09:16] constraint in the person of the Lord
[1:09:18] Jesus Christ and it took a message of
[1:09:21] the hour to reveal that to you to say
[1:09:23] I'm am heavenbound I'm not confined by
[1:09:26] this world or the Enemy Within it I live
[1:09:29] outside of this constraint so therefore
[1:09:32] when you talk about overcoming you talk
[1:09:35] about um uh uh healing when you talk
[1:09:38] about resisting the devil and he will
[1:09:40] flee think about it within that context
[1:09:42] of the devil only has so much time he
[1:09:46] only has so much time and I believe that
[1:09:49] it's very near to the point where we're
[1:09:51] going to leave this world and at that
[1:09:53] point will just go
[1:09:55] faster and our perception of reality
[1:09:58] will be totally different because it's
[1:10:00] relative to time and Satan's perception
[1:10:03] is different so he doesn't know he he
[1:10:05] can't stop it because he's constrained
[1:10:07] by it a construct directly crafted by
[1:10:10] God to to allow his
[1:10:14] end amen he lifted you outside of that
[1:10:18] constraint and he left Satan within it
[1:10:21] because it had a beginning and it has an
[1:10:22] end and he is the Alpha and the
[1:10:27] Omega isn't that
[1:10:30] mindblowing and you think about that do
[1:10:33] you understand how small Satan
[1:10:36] is and we think about it in terms of you
[1:10:39] know um brother Steve you don't know
[1:10:41] what I'm dealing with I I
[1:10:43] don't and I I I even think of this um
[1:10:47] you think about anxiety you think about
[1:10:49] depression you think about that's just
[1:10:51] rampant uh uh nowadays y um suicide
[1:10:55] those those spirits and those things uh
[1:10:58] depression is absolutely a spirit yes um
[1:11:01] you can be depressed it's absolutely a
[1:11:03] spirit anxiety is absolutely a a
[1:11:06] spirit and I I believe that when we when
[1:11:10] you look at it with this perspective you
[1:11:13] can say with
[1:11:15] confidence Satan get thee behind me you
[1:11:19] shall not Prevail that's right when you
[1:11:21] look at it with a perception of I I not
[1:11:24] confined by the same constraints that
[1:11:26] you are there's a greater power that's
[1:11:28] within me it's greater than in within me
[1:11:31] than he that's within the world then
[1:11:33] your decision making
[1:11:35] changes when I became a uh when I was
[1:11:38] filled with the Holy Spirit everything
[1:11:40] changed I think differently you look at
[1:11:42] the world differently you think of time
[1:11:46] differently you you everything changes
[1:11:48] because behold all things that are in
[1:11:50] Christ are made new and so my decision
[1:11:52] making uh it it just changed when you're
[1:11:55] filled with the baptism of the holy
[1:11:57] spirit amen but I want you to understand
[1:11:59] when you look at at life and you look at
[1:12:01] the circumstances and you look at the
[1:12:03] moment that God has given you when you
[1:12:05] look at it with the perception of I have
[1:12:07] all eternity behind me all eternity is
[1:12:11] is here with me it's it's Christ in you
[1:12:15] the hope of glory a great mystery that
[1:12:18] would be revealed to to the to the
[1:12:20] Gentiles to you amen so it's Christ in
[1:12:23] me the hope of Glory that means if you
[1:12:24] bring it down into every moment and you
[1:12:27] look at it as Paul encourages you to do
[1:12:30] as an
[1:12:31] opportunity then within that opportunity
[1:12:34] within that moment you can confidently
[1:12:37] say Satan get the behind me and if you
[1:12:41] can't confidently do that then you can
[1:12:43] confidently boldly run to the throne of
[1:12:46] grace yes amen you can absolutely
[1:12:49] receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:12:52] as I'm speaking to you
[1:12:53] you can have it right now you don't have
[1:12:56] to wait because you have
[1:12:59] time you have a moment that is
[1:13:03] specifically crafted by God you don't
[1:13:06] have the future because it is not here
[1:13:09] yet the past is the past you have right
[1:13:12] now but you're not guaranteed
[1:13:14] tomorrow you don't know when he will the
[1:13:17] day or the hour when we when he comes we
[1:13:20] know the season that he will come and it
[1:13:22] is now yeah so if you are if you doubt
[1:13:25] whether or not you have the Holy Ghost
[1:13:27] you can receive it right now at this
[1:13:30] moment in time because God crafted this
[1:13:32] moment in time and gave it to you he
[1:13:35] didn't give it to someone in the past he
[1:13:37] gave it to you every single one of you
[1:13:39] this evening he gives you this moment
[1:13:42] and you can decide what you do with it
[1:13:45] so why would you
[1:13:46] wait what what does hinder thee run to
[1:13:50] it I say I say seize the moment
[1:13:54] time is a gift of God and it's given to
[1:13:57] you so make the right decision progress
[1:14:00] well change well don't lose the
[1:14:03] opportunity make the decision you don't
[1:14:06] have to wait till a Saturday night
[1:14:08] service to have a a prayer line
[1:14:10] experience you can have it right
[1:14:12] now it's not about you waiting until
[1:14:14] Sunday or waiting till the opportune
[1:14:16] moment it's not guaranteed you've got
[1:14:19] right
[1:14:20] now make the decision
[1:14:23] praise
[1:14:25] God Amen God left Satan within the
[1:14:28] constraints of time I I believe in in
[1:14:32] large part he crafted time so that Satan
[1:14:34] would have an end so that you would have
[1:14:37] the confidence he will not he will not
[1:14:40] overcome me he has a he has an expected
[1:14:43] end we have an expected end he has an
[1:14:46] expected end and our expected end is a
[1:14:49] beginning our expected end is is that he
[1:14:52] would come and he would change us and
[1:14:54] that he would mold us and craft us and
[1:14:56] and shape us into the likeness of Jesus
[1:14:59] Christ he would do that continually and
[1:15:01] over and over every moment and every
[1:15:04] moment if the Lord should carry you
[1:15:06] change and you grow and you mature in
[1:15:08] the Lord Jesus Christ and brother
[1:15:10] Brandon would say it was the old lady
[1:15:12] who said I'm not thank God I'm not what
[1:15:14] I used to be I'm not what I I'm not what
[1:15:17] I ought to be I'm not what I want to be
[1:15:19] but thank God I'm not what I used to
[1:15:21] be he who began a good work in you will
[1:15:25] finish it so if you've made your
[1:15:27] decision and you're sitting here tonight
[1:15:29] maybe you've been filled with the Holy
[1:15:30] Spirit for 30 years and you're sitting
[1:15:33] here tonight and you're saying I just I
[1:15:34] feel so empty or I I don't know what it
[1:15:37] is or maybe you're struggling with
[1:15:38] anxiety maybe you're struggling with
[1:15:40] with depression a great deal of us are
[1:15:43] right Satan might tries to make you feel
[1:15:46] like you're isolated and you're the only
[1:15:47] one dealing with it everyone's got
[1:15:49] anxiety to whatever degree it varies you
[1:15:53] may be dealing with it to the point
[1:15:54] where um uh medicine may be needed the
[1:15:57] Lord allows that all these different
[1:15:59] things but you you may be at a point in
[1:16:01] your life you're saying I I don't know
[1:16:02] what to do brother Steve you've got this
[1:16:05] moment and you've got all
[1:16:07] eternity right here with us this
[1:16:11] evening we believe that or we don't
[1:16:15] you've got all eternity right here
[1:16:17] because he said I'll be with you where
[1:16:20] two or three are gathered in my name I
[1:16:21] believe he's here that means he's right
[1:16:24] here in this room and he's given us this
[1:16:26] moment to
[1:16:28] respond to
[1:16:30] him he created time a construct the only
[1:16:34] context that we have to relate to the
[1:16:36] world around us I know that Sunday was
[1:16:39] and I know that Sunday is coming so
[1:16:41] we're constrained by it to a large
[1:16:43] degree but in the same right the Holy
[1:16:46] Spirit and by his grace lifts us outside
[1:16:50] of that constraint although we're we're
[1:16:52] EarthBound but One Sweet Day will be
[1:16:55] changed and our perception of time will
[1:16:58] change because it'll be relative to
[1:17:00] something else and then we'll be changed
[1:17:02] in a moment of a twinkling of an eye and
[1:17:05] then we'll move into this whole new new
[1:17:07] phase of of existence that's apart from
[1:17:10] the constraint of time but thanks be to
[1:17:13] God that Satan will be left within
[1:17:17] it I want you to understand how small
[1:17:20] Satan is I want you to understand how
[1:17:23] important every single moment
[1:17:25] is God's given you this time you know
[1:17:28] he's given you every single moment with
[1:17:30] your children he's given you every
[1:17:31] single moment with your spouse and those
[1:17:34] are
[1:17:35] important those are not to be said well
[1:17:37] you know I don't have time with this or
[1:17:38] I don't want to deal with this or you
[1:17:40] know um this is of no importance God's
[1:17:43] given you every single moment with your
[1:17:45] family with your friends with your work
[1:17:47] co-workers all the things that you do in
[1:17:49] your career the Lord is extremely
[1:17:51] invested in what you do with your with
[1:17:53] your work you ever thought about that
[1:17:55] sometimes the scripture says whatever
[1:17:57] your hand finds to do do it with all thy
[1:18:00] might as unto the Lord so the Lord wants
[1:18:02] to be involved in that so that you would
[1:18:05] do well so that you would Prosper this
[1:18:06] is not Prosperity Gospel it's just the
[1:18:08] reality of the grace and mercy of
[1:18:10] almighty God he wants to be there in
[1:18:12] every single moment that you
[1:18:16] have
[1:18:19] amen so here's the
[1:18:21] thing
[1:18:23] in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 he said he
[1:18:25] hath made everything beautiful in his
[1:18:28] time and also he hath set the world in
[1:18:31] their heart so that no man can find out
[1:18:34] the work that God maketh from the
[1:18:36] beginning to the
[1:18:38] end he's he's planted eternity he's made
[1:18:42] everything beautiful in his time he's
[1:18:43] given a sense of Divine Purpose in your
[1:18:47] heart he's allowed you to understand
[1:18:50] there's something greater than just this
[1:18:53] amen he he's divinely given you that
[1:18:56] understanding that's a gift of the Holy
[1:18:57] Spirit you think outside of that that
[1:19:00] context you're think you're looking at
[1:19:02] by the grace of of almighty God in the
[1:19:04] message of the hour you can see the the
[1:19:06] the the how everything plays out how how
[1:19:09] um uh the Rapture happens God turns to
[1:19:12] the Jews uh we go to the wedding supper
[1:19:14] we go into a millennial Reign all these
[1:19:16] different things you can look at all
[1:19:17] these different things from the
[1:19:18] beginning to the end with that
[1:19:19] perception and with that understanding
[1:19:21] by the grace of God
[1:19:23] that's why zerubabel the only thing he
[1:19:25] could say when the pyramid uh came down
[1:19:27] when the cap came down on top of the
[1:19:29] pyramid the only thing that he could say
[1:19:30] to it was Grace Grace unto it that's why
[1:19:34] brother random said Shalom to the bride
[1:19:37] peace be unto you because you've got
[1:19:39] this understanding and this awareness of
[1:19:41] where you stand he's placed that Divine
[1:19:43] Purpose in you and then Paul comes right
[1:19:46] along in Ephesians chapter 5 and he says
[1:19:50] in four verse 14 wherefore saith he
[1:19:53] awake thou that
[1:19:56] sleepest don't waste the
[1:19:58] moments awake thou that sleepest and he
[1:20:01] says and Christ shall give thee light
[1:20:04] arise from the dead see then that you
[1:20:06] walk circumspectly not as fools but as
[1:20:09] wise you know what that means it's as
[1:20:10] you walk a tight RPP somebody walks a
[1:20:13] tight rope they have to walk it very
[1:20:15] circumspectly very carefully because if
[1:20:17] you say hey Bob yes naturally he's going
[1:20:20] to fall off the tight rope so the idea
[1:20:23] and this what it says in scripture is
[1:20:25] very very clear walk
[1:20:27] carefully you know how you do that you
[1:20:29] do that moment by
[1:20:31] moment worry and anxiety is something
[1:20:34] that may or may not happen depression is
[1:20:37] worrying about something in the past
[1:20:39] right depression is is is um is is down
[1:20:43] because of something that has happened
[1:20:45] or something that that occurred anxiety
[1:20:48] is worry or or or or anxiety and worry
[1:20:52] is is something that hasn't even
[1:20:54] happened it's imagination so that's an
[1:20:57] Avenue of Satan to play with your
[1:21:00] imagination right because that's an
[1:21:02] Avenue of the spirit realm so naturally
[1:21:04] he's going to get in your head and begin
[1:21:05] to make you think all of these different
[1:21:06] things and imagine all these different
[1:21:08] things that's how anxiety works now it
[1:21:10] is an evil spirit but it works and plays
[1:21:13] at your mind about something that may or
[1:21:15] may not have happened tomorrow my
[1:21:17] business is going to go
[1:21:18] kaput I think there's going to be people
[1:21:20] who are going to need your services
[1:21:22] tomorrow
[1:21:23] so if one customer calls today and says
[1:21:26] I I don't want you to ever come back
[1:21:29] then there's probably going to be
[1:21:30] somebody else who needs that the next
[1:21:32] day but anxiety and worry a very tool of
[1:21:36] the devil to get you to bring that
[1:21:38] moment and totally shapes and perverts
[1:21:42] the moment that God gave you Satan is a
[1:21:46] perverter So within the constraint of
[1:21:48] time his power is perversion that's what
[1:21:51] death is is a per perversion of Life
[1:21:53] brother brandom taught all about this so
[1:21:55] he says it's a perversion of life so
[1:21:56] Satan's only power is to pervert that
[1:21:59] which God intended for his glory so
[1:22:02] anxiety and worry is is is imagining
[1:22:05] something that may or may not happen and
[1:22:07] existing in in something that you don't
[1:22:10] even have which is the
[1:22:12] future so why would you want to exist in
[1:22:15] in in in something that may or may not
[1:22:16] have happened and I realize that some
[1:22:18] people can be very sick you can be to
[1:22:20] the point where you're debilitated
[1:22:23] uh uh laying on on a on a on a couch
[1:22:25] without any hope uh for for the future
[1:22:28] depressed and anxious and that's the
[1:22:30] enemy perverting a moment in time for
[1:22:34] you but God does not intend for that
[1:22:37] perversion to last that's why he says be
[1:22:40] of good cheer because in me I I have
[1:22:43] overcome the world so be of good cheer
[1:22:46] in the world naturally you're going to
[1:22:48] have tribulation the customers are going
[1:22:49] to call and they will not like you but
[1:22:53] be of good cheer because I've overcome
[1:22:55] the world in me you have
[1:22:59] peace he's given you that moment and you
[1:23:02] have the ability the choice the choice
[1:23:06] to to to allow the Holy Spirit to take
[1:23:10] over that moment amen that's why he says
[1:23:13] I I I have hid Thy word in my heart that
[1:23:15] I might not sit against thee all these
[1:23:17] scriptures come into light I I will I uh
[1:23:20] he he will keep in perfect peace who my
[1:23:22] mind is stayed on theee that's not
[1:23:25] psychology that's just
[1:23:28] scripture he whose mind who has stayed
[1:23:31] on
[1:23:33] thee Satan wants to play with that and
[1:23:36] pervert every single moment that God has
[1:23:39] given you he'll put fear into your mind
[1:23:41] right now you say brother Steve I want
[1:23:43] to respond to the Holy Spirit whatever
[1:23:45] that may look like for you right amen I
[1:23:48] don't know you may you may run around
[1:23:50] you may just sit at your seat I don't
[1:23:52] know it may look very different for each
[1:23:53] one of you but he may put fear in your
[1:23:56] mind and say I don't want to
[1:23:58] respond that's Satan perverting a moment
[1:24:01] that the holy spirit is trying to deal
[1:24:02] with you don't let Satan you have the
[1:24:05] you have the confidence with the
[1:24:07] understanding that you have to say Satan
[1:24:10] get thee behind me you shall not
[1:24:17] Prevail I want to stop right
[1:24:21] there
[1:24:23] I want to stop right
[1:24:26] there I think about um just driving down
[1:24:29] the road and sister s and I were driving
[1:24:31] and um listening to some music and I was
[1:24:34] just thinking about all of the
[1:24:39] events that have led me to this point in
[1:24:43] time and you may think that you don't
[1:24:46] amount I don't I don't know I just feel
[1:24:48] this on my heart you may think that you
[1:24:49] don't amount to anything you may think
[1:24:52] that you don't have a lot of value you
[1:24:54] think well brother Steve I'm just you
[1:24:56] know I just I don't feel like I'm
[1:24:58] contributing anything I don't feel like
[1:24:59] I'm of any value I you know I'm dealing
[1:25:02] with this or I've got this problem and
[1:25:03] this problem you think about all the
[1:25:05] events that have happened to lead you to
[1:25:08] this moment amen and there is one thing
[1:25:10] for for
[1:25:12] sure he who has begun a good work in you
[1:25:15] will finish it until the very end so if
[1:25:18] he brought you this
[1:25:20] far he'll bring you the rest of the way
[1:25:23] you have enough confidence in him to
[1:25:25] believe that if he brought you this far
[1:25:27] he'll bring you the rest of the way
[1:25:28] you're tired tonight you don't feel well
[1:25:31] that's fine you'll feel better you'll
[1:25:33] feel better One Sweet Day you'll feel
[1:25:35] very good but you'll probably feel
[1:25:37] better in the next couple days and you
[1:25:39] can you can let Satan get you down which
[1:25:42] is what has nothing better to do what
[1:25:45] else is he going to do so naturally he's
[1:25:48] going to try to pull you down and
[1:25:50] pervert the moment
[1:25:53] which is right now so I encourage you
[1:25:56] and I I I implore you as Paul said
[1:25:59] redeem the time knowing what we know
[1:26:02] knowing where we are going having the
[1:26:05] message of the hour firmly in our grasp
[1:26:08] and understanding what we we understand
[1:26:10] I'm not saying you have to understand
[1:26:12] all the Mysteries but the knowledge that
[1:26:14] you do have the spirit of wisdom and of
[1:26:16] revelation will work according to it and
[1:26:19] he will work and perform to his good
[1:26:22] pleasure in your life so if he brought
[1:26:24] you this far he will bring you the rest
[1:26:27] of the way do you have confidence in
[1:26:32] that would you bow your heads with me
[1:26:35] musicians won't you
[1:26:42] come I just want to pray with
[1:26:49] you Heavenly Father Lord I Thank you for
[1:26:53] this
[1:26:57] moment I thank you for this Moment In
[1:27:01] Time Lord um
[1:27:05] I I I it's a natural tendency for
[1:27:08] individuals to think about the past and

[1:27:20] without memory is there but Lord I I
[1:27:22] pray that within this moment we could
[1:27:24] forget those things which are behind us
[1:27:27] and press towards the mark of the High

[1:27:31] it's going to be very long before we

[1:28:03] then may I press on well may I change

[1:32:49] trying to distract you yes
[1:32:52] that's really his only tool is is is

[1:32:58] off of God's
[1:33:00] program my goodness I love that brother
[1:33:03] Stephen I I think more about Redeeming
[1:33:06] the
[1:33:07] time I I really realize tonight
[1:33:12] [Music]
[1:33:13] that no wonder brother brandom said to
[1:33:17] make you an overcomer that's not him
[1:33:20] just pushing you through pipe you know
[1:33:23] putting you in a mold and then opening
[1:33:25] up and saying oh what a great Overcomer
[1:33:26] he said no this is something you got to
[1:33:29] do you learn tonight that you have
[1:33:31] control you have more control than the
[1:33:33] devil wants to make wants to ever let
[1:33:35] you believe I I love the fact
[1:33:39] that Satan is bound by time which means
[1:33:43] he will end but I will
[1:33:46] not oh I'm an eternal being having a
[1:33:49] Time experience when when when it runs
[1:33:52] out I will be but he will not have not I
[1:33:56] told you all this time he ain't nobody
[1:33:59] come on he ain't nobody he's a he's a
[1:34:01] creature trapped in time I really his
[1:34:04] only purpose here he's a he he's he's
[1:34:08] ordained of God to drive me to to
[1:34:11] Perfection wow to drive me could I say
[1:34:14] it like this to drive us back to
[1:34:17] Perfection I started in God I'm going
[1:34:20] back to God yes oh my goodness my
[1:34:25] goodness you know something
[1:34:27] [Music]
[1:34:29] friends I was thinking about
[1:34:32] this you know brother brandham talked
[1:34:35] about
[1:34:36] Abraham and how that
[1:34:38] Abraham was a Sojourner and he was
[1:34:41] looking for something now we're getting
[1:34:44] ready to go to prayer I'm not going to
[1:34:45] bring you all up tonight because we've
[1:34:47] had so much sickness we're going to stay
[1:34:48] right where we are and I'll take a look
[1:34:51] and see if I have any prayer requests I
[1:34:52] didn't see any uh but I might have some
[1:34:54] I haven't noticed yet but we'll pray in
[1:34:56] a minute but before we
[1:34:57] [Music]
[1:35:01] do Abraham was looking for a
[1:35:05] real tangible City and brother brandham
[1:35:09] said he knew it was somewhere cuz he had
[1:35:13] already met its
[1:35:15] king he had met its king the king of
[1:35:17] Salem amen and so he knew that was an
[1:35:21] eternal being that I met so there must
[1:35:23] be an eternal City and brother brandham
[1:35:25] said he went everywhere looking for it
[1:35:27] and brother brandham said right where he
[1:35:29] built his altar he said that City he was
[1:35:32] looking for that real one not not a
[1:35:34] metaphor a real City he said it was just
[1:35:37] above
[1:35:39] him it was just above him so you know
[1:35:43] you need healing tonight well guess what
[1:35:46] I got a body that's just above me that's
[1:35:50] that's a per that that if if this
[1:35:52] Tabernacle be dissolved I have one
[1:35:54] already waiting and that's why brother
[1:35:56] brandham said Divine Healing is just a
[1:35:58] little deposit little Earnest of the
[1:36:00] Resurrection see no wonder that the
[1:36:04] Bible says all the good things come down
