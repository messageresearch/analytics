[4:28] for e
[5:12] morning
[5:13] everyone uh let's let's
[5:17] stand going to continue on our topic
[5:21] Israel God's time piece this will be
[5:23] part seven we'll pray heavenly father
[5:26] thank you so much for this time of
[5:28] fellowship and your word together Lord I
[5:30] pray that your Holy Spirit would be be
[5:33] in our midst Lord and take your word and
[5:35] write it on our hearts be with us and
[5:38] guide and direct our thoughts we we need
[5:41] we need you we need your anointing we
[5:44] need your wisdom Lord we ask in Jesus
[5:46] name amen go ahead and bring up the
[5:48] PowerPoint we'll start at uh Zechariah
[5:52] Chapter 13 and we'll read a couple
[5:54] verses in that day there shall be a
[5:57] fountain open to the House of David into
[5:59] the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and
[6:03] for uncleanness and it shall come to
[6:05] pass in that day sayith the Lord of
[6:06] hosts that I will cut off the names of
[6:08] the idols out of the land and they shall
[6:10] no more be remembered and also I will
[6:12] cause the prophets and the unclean
[6:14] Spirit to pass out of the land may the
[6:16] Lord add the blessing to the reading of
[6:18] his word you can be
[6:20] seated
[6:23] so looking at this verse of course we
[6:27] understand it's speaking of the end time
[6:30] um if we saw previously in
[6:35] um Zechariah
[6:38] 12 it a few back he said he'll pour out
[6:43] on the House of David and upon the
[6:44] habitants of Jerusalem the spirit of
[6:47] Grace and of Supplication and they shall
[6:49] look upon me whom they have pierced and
[6:52] they shall mourn for him as one mour for
[6:54] his only son and shall be in bitterness
[6:56] for him as one that is in bitterness for
[7:00] his firstborn so as we looked
[7:03] before we understand that he's going to
[7:05] open a fountain for them it's a Fountain
[7:08] of Grace it's a restoration to the New
[7:11] Covenant you know we looked at also uh
[7:15] and we'll we'll read it again but we
[7:17] looked at uh chapter 14 of the Book of
[7:22] Revelation and we refer to this they
[7:25] will look upon him I believe and it
[7:28] shall come let's keep reading it and
[7:29] when it it shall come to pass that when
[7:31] any shall yet prophesy then his father
[7:34] and his mother that begat him shall say
[7:35] unto him Thou shalt not live for thou
[7:38] speakest lies in the name of the Lord
[7:39] and his father and his mother that begat
[7:41] him shall thrust him through when he
[7:43] prophesies and it shall come to pass in
[7:45] that day that the prophet shall be
[7:46] ashamed every one of his vision when he
[7:49] has prophesied neither shall he wear a
[7:52] rough garment to
[7:55] deceive but he shall say I no Prophet I
[7:57] am husbandman for a man taught to keep
[7:59] cattle from my Youth and one shall say
[8:02] unto him what are these wounds in thy
[8:03] hands then he shall answer those those
[8:06] with which I was wounded in the house of
[8:10] my friends amen awake oh sword against
[8:13] my shepherd and against the man that is
[8:15] my fellow sayith the Lord of hosts Smite
[8:17] the shepherd and the Sheep shall be
[8:19] scattered and I will turn mine hand upon
[8:21] the little ones and it shall come to
[8:22] pass that in all the land sayeth the
[8:24] Lord two parts therein shall be cut off
[8:26] and die and the third part shall be left
[8:29] therein and I will bring the third part
[8:31] through the fire and I will refine them
[8:33] as silver is refined and will try them
[8:35] as gold is tried they shall call on my
[8:37] name and I will hear them I will say it
[8:39] is my people and they shall say the Lord
[8:42] is my God
[8:45] Amen so as we look and as we study this
[8:49] you can become confused because you just
[8:51] saw in one verse there's 2,000 years of
[8:54] History you have the the past being
[8:58] spoken of and the future
[9:00] being spoken of at the same time you
[9:03] have almost looks like as you're look
[9:06] reading the
[9:07] context he says the prophets will be
[9:13] ashamed and then suddenly it
[9:16] says I'm no Prophet I'm H am a husband
[9:19] and I taught to keep cattle from my
[9:21] youth one shall say what are the wounds
[9:23] in your hands so it's jumping from false
[9:27] prophets to the true prophet back and
[9:30] forth so you can see in and and again
[9:35] thousands of years in the in the past
[9:37] and scripture does this very often we we
[9:40] understand that brother Bram taught us
[9:42] that clearly from the word that in one
[9:46] prophecy you can have 2,000 years of
[9:48] History Malachi 4: 6 2,000 years of
[9:52] History Isaiah
[9:54] 61 2,000 years of History just in a
[9:58] comma
[9:59] or in that case I think it's a semicolon
[10:02] but we won't strain in a that and
[10:04] swallow a
[10:05] camel but you see just in that one verse
[10:09] there's a lot of history and it's
[10:11] jumping back and forth and there can be
[10:13] a confusion I think if you want to
[10:15] really look at the picture of what's
[10:17] happening it is going back and forth and
[10:21] it's speaking of the the attitude of the
[10:24] people towards the prophets and the
[10:26] false doctrine that the Jewish Nation is
[10:29] full of
[10:31] now that that's one that's people have a
[10:34] hard time swallowing and understanding
[10:36] much of Judaism that we have today is
[10:41] simply false Doctrine false teaching a
[10:45] false interpretation much of it in
[10:47] reality is a response against Christ
[10:51] against Christianity instead of looking
[10:54] at where they're at in
[10:56] Prophecy uh and repenting
[11:00] they dig down and to their own shame
[11:04] Mock and belittle Christ and so this is
[11:07] the attitude towards the prophets in
[11:09] fact this will be the attitude towards
[11:11] the two witnesses in Revelation
[11:13] 11 it tells us there there'll be two
[11:16] witnesses Moses and
[11:18] Elijah and these two men will go forward
[11:21] and they will actually be rejected by
[11:23] the majority of Israel amen and so when
[11:28] when you see these prophecies that
[11:30] speaking of they will look upon Him whom
[11:32] they pierced on the top of Mount Zion
[11:35] we'll go
[11:39] there and I looked and lo a lamb stood
[11:42] on Mount Zion and with him 144,000
[11:45] having his father's name written in
[11:47] their foreheads there it looks like okay
[11:50] Jesus comes down at the to meet us in
[11:55] the air goes up to the wedding supper
[11:58] then he comes down is on Mount Zion then
[12:00] he goes back up then he comes down in
[12:02] Revelation 19 it's a misunderstanding
[12:06] how is the Lamb standing on Mount
[12:08] Zion before he actually returns with his
[12:12] bride how is that how how does the
[12:17] spiritual revelation of who Jesus is
[12:20] Jesus of Nazareth is come to the nation
[12:23] of Israel does it come by Jesus coming
[12:26] and saying oh look at my hands
[12:29] look at my feet they look upon whom they
[12:32] pierced by a spirit of Revelation how is
[12:35] the son of man revealed to us in this
[12:38] day in physical
[12:41] form brother bradam says any man could
[12:43] come and say I got nail Pierce in my
[12:46] hands but no man can do what the spirit
[12:49] does through the body of Christ right
[12:53] and that's the same thing these the lamb
[12:56] is standing with the 144,000 by Spirit
[12:59] of Revelation that has been broken forth
[13:02] upon them it is finally open to their
[13:05] hearts who the lamb actually was and
[13:09] what his purpose to them they're
[13:12] blinded read read Isaiah
[13:15] 53 to a Jewish person and they say
[13:18] that's speaking about the nation of
[13:20] Israel that's not speaking about the
[13:22] Messiah see they've reinterpreted
[13:25] everything so that their eyes could stay
[13:27] blind but it'll come a time when
[13:29] there'll be two prophets come on the
[13:30] scene amen and the lamb will be revealed
[13:33] to them and it'll be that when that
[13:36] Revelation comes it'll be just as good
[13:38] as it'll actually be better than him
[13:41] standing there saying look at my hands
[13:44] look at my feet because even
[13:46] Thomas blessed are those who have not
[13:48] seen and do
[13:50] believe amen right it even to those who
[13:54] saw it had to be a spiritual revelation
[13:57] of who that was because it was a stone
[13:59] of stumbling to Israel Messiah is
[14:02] supposed to come and Conquer Rome
[14:05] conquer the Nations right that's their
[14:08] that's their understanding even the
[14:11] apostles when Christ came they couldn't
[14:14] catch the Revelation they only got it in
[14:17] part until the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[14:19] came on the day of Pentecost even then
[14:22] just before that they said will you at
[14:24] this time restore the kingdom to Israel
[14:27] they didn't understand they didn't get
[14:29] it the Jewish mind became so corrupted
[14:34] by their interpretation of Prophecy that
[14:36] they couldn't see what was coming to
[14:38] pass right in front of them and that's
[14:40] the same thing that's happened to the
[14:42] Gentile Church prophecy coming to pass
[14:46] being fulfilled they can't see it right
[14:48] in front of them and the same thing will
[14:50] happen to much of
[14:53] Israel right but all Israel will be
[14:57] saved all the elect all the elected
[15:01] Remnant that's the predestinated seed of
[15:03] Israel will be
[15:06] saved all right let's keep let's keep
[15:09] going and again that's the 144,000 and
[15:12] how are the
[15:13] 144,000 sealed by receiving the
[15:16] revelation of the word through the two
[15:20] witnesses that's how they're sealed
[15:22] that's how they see receive a revelation
[15:25] of the father's name is by the preaching
[15:28] of the two witnesses
[15:31] amen Ezekiel
[15:34] 22 therefore thus saith the Lord God
[15:37] because you all are all become D behold
[15:40] therefore I will gather you into the
[15:42] midst of Jerusalem as they GA gather
[15:46] silver and brass and iron and lead and
[15:49] Tin into the midst of the furnace to
[15:51] blow the fire upon it to melt it so will
[15:54] I gather you in mine anger and in my
[15:58] Fury
[15:59] and I will leave you there and melt you
[16:03] H isn't that interesting he's going to
[16:05] gather Israel together in his Fury so he
[16:09] doesn't gather them together in
[16:12] Grace think about that how did Israel
[16:15] get back to the
[16:17] land ultimately it is Grace we
[16:20] understand that but it's in his Fury he
[16:23] gathers them to together because they
[16:25] were blinded they rejected Christ they
[16:28] turned from him him and here we are we
[16:31] see the pograms in the Soviet Union and
[16:35] the Nazis Gathering them together we
[16:37] talked about the Fishers this is God
[16:40] pouring out his wrath upon the nation of
[16:42] Israel and in the same turn bringing
[16:45] forth his grace to bring him back to the
[16:47] land but ultimately they don't receive
[16:50] their Grace until they're back in the
[16:52] land amen so in his anger he gathers
[16:55] them back to Israel to Jerusalem
[16:59] yes I will gather you and blow upon you
[17:01] in the fire of my wrath and you shall be
[17:04] melted in the midst thereof as silver is
[17:06] melted in the midst of the Furnace so
[17:08] shall you be melted in the midst thereof
[17:11] and you shall know that I the Lord have
[17:14] poured out my Fury upon you even
[17:17] remember when are they when are the
[17:19] 144,000 saved they're not saved in the
[17:22] grace
[17:24] age they're saved in the time s once the
[17:27] bride is taken out of the away then
[17:30] God's Wrath begins to be poured out upon
[17:32] the Earth we're the ones preventing the
[17:34] wrath of God Amen being poured out upon
[17:37] the Earth but once we're taken out of
[17:39] the way that that will Antichrist will
[17:42] be be fully manifested Satan incarnate
[17:45] in flesh and the wrath of God will be
[17:48] poured out and he's using those two
[17:51] witnesses it's part of their Ministry to
[17:53] Smite the Earth with curses and plagues
[17:57] like the Bible said and in the midst of
[18:00] that I believe that's part of their
[18:02] Vindication just as part of Moses
[18:05] Vindication in Egypt was smiting that
[18:08] land with plagues so will part of Moses
[18:11] and Elijah's Vindication of their
[18:13] ministry will be smiting the Earth with
[18:17] plagues amen preventing rain etc etc and
[18:22] so their ministry will do that and in so
[18:24] doing it to the true elected it will
[18:27] vindicate the word heard that they're
[18:29] preaching they'll be preaching to them
[18:31] the New Covenant the things that we have
[18:35] been restored unto it will be to them
[18:39] the new the true New Covenant the
[18:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost the Seal of
[18:44] God but it's in the midst of the Furnace
[18:47] that he's doing this it's in the midst
[18:50] of the Dragon spurting his water against
[18:53] the
[18:54] woman amen we should we should have
[18:57] included that scripture revelation 12
[18:59] the woman
[19:01] Israel and
[19:04] so we'll keep continue
[19:06] on behold the day of the Lord cometh now
[19:10] this is speaking of the tribulation
[19:14] period when the day of the Lord when he
[19:16] pours out his wrath upon the
[19:18] Earth then then comes the
[19:22] Millennium so the day of the Lord comes
[19:24] and thy spoil shall be
[19:26] divided in the midst of Thee
[19:30] for I will gather all nations against
[19:32] Jerusalem to battle right so you have to
[19:35] see if you realize you're living in the
[19:37] end time you have to see the tide of the
[19:40] Nations will be going against
[19:45] Israel and to the point where they're
[19:47] all ready to gather in war and fight
[19:50] against them which we see that process
[19:52] taking
[19:54] place even in America now even from
[19:58] conservative ranks an
[20:00] anti-israel Viewpoint is starting to
[20:03] raise
[20:04] up and the city shall be taken notice
[20:07] and the house is rifled and the women
[20:10] ravished and half of the sh City shall
[20:13] go forth into captivity and the residue
[20:16] of the people shall not be cut off from
[20:18] the city so you see there'll be such a
[20:21] war towards the end of the Great
[20:23] Tribulation period that it will that the
[20:27] attack will come against Jerusalem M and
[20:30] there will be people brought out of the
[20:32] city sent out of the
[20:35] city right amen and there will be a
[20:38] great a a oh man a great persecution
[20:42] taking
[20:43] place then shall the Lord go forth and
[20:46] fight against those Nations as when he
[20:50] fought in the day of battle so you see
[20:53] it's in the midst of a furnace of fire a
[20:55] furnace of Affliction that the spirit of
[20:57] Grace is being being poured out and
[20:59] supplications is being poured out upon
[21:02] Israel then at the culmination of all of
[21:05] this that's when the Lord Goes Forth and
[21:08] he fights against those Nations as when
[21:11] he fought in the day of battle here and
[21:14] his feet shall stand in that day upon
[21:17] the Mount of Olives which is before
[21:19] Jerusalem on the
[21:21] East and the Mount of Olives shall
[21:23] cleave in the midst thereof toward the
[21:25] East and toward the west and there shall
[21:28] be a very great valley and half of the
[21:31] mountains shall remove toward the North
[21:32] and half of it toward the
[21:36] South and ye shall flee to the Valley of
[21:39] the mountains for the Valley of the
[21:40] mountains shall reach unto us all yay ye
[21:43] shall flee like as he fled from before
[21:46] the earthquake in the days of Uzziah
[21:48] king of Judah and the Lord my God shall
[21:51] come and all the saints with thee see
[21:54] there's this is revelation 19
[21:59] the coming of the Lord with his Saints
[22:02] shall come down to fight against the
[22:05] Nations and shall end up there in on
[22:09] Mount olives just outside the city Gates
[22:13] of
[22:14] Jerusalem and it shall come to pass in
[22:17] that day that the light shall not be
[22:19] clear nor dark now you see how prophecy
[22:21] works you know this verse but it shall
[22:24] be in one day which shall be known to
[22:26] the Lord not day nor night but it shall
[22:28] come to pass that at the evening time it
[22:32] shall be light we know brother brandham
[22:35] uses this scripture over and over and
[22:37] over again and sang the song ultimately
[22:40] this scripture is speaking about the end
[22:43] of the Great Tribulation period but we
[22:45] see again for the Gentile bride there's
[22:49] also an end time where there's an
[22:51] evening light message that goes forth so
[22:54] there's an evening light message that
[22:55] goes forth for the Gentiles and there's
[22:58] an evening light message that goes forth
[23:01] for the Jews what is that evening light
[23:04] message what does it culminate in Christ
[23:07] and his bride returning back to defeat
[23:10] the Antichrist in his
[23:12] armies and it shall be in that day that
[23:14] Living Waters shall go out from
[23:17] Jerusalem you see this process now we're
[23:21] turning God has poured out the spirit of
[23:24] Grace and supplications upon the nation
[23:26] of Israel so that the remnant 100
[23:29] 44,000 are be are saved then the Lord
[23:33] returns back to Earth
[23:36] again and it says that is when Living
[23:40] Waters will come out from Jerusalem
[23:41] again this is speaking of the
[23:43] Millennium half of them towards the
[23:45] former sea half of them toward the
[23:48] hinder sea in summer and in Winter it
[23:50] shall be and the Lord shall be king over
[23:54] all the Earth so that's what he's coming
[23:56] back to do
[23:58] and in that day shall there be one Lord
[24:01] and his name one and all the land shall
[24:04] be turned as a plain from giba to remon
[24:07] south of Jerusalem and it shall be
[24:09] lifted up and inhabited in her place
[24:11] from Benjamin's gate under the place of
[24:13] the first gate under the corner gate and
[24:15] from the Tower of hanal Unto the King's
[24:18] Wine
[24:20] Press and Men shall dwell in it there
[24:22] shall be no more utter destruction but
[24:25] Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited amen
[24:29] amen when you preach this in an Arabic
[24:31] speaking world everybody goes quiet
[24:33] what's he preaching about we don't like
[24:36] to hear about Jerusalem's Victory and
[24:39] joy and this is going to be the capital
[24:40] city it's so strange but people have
[24:43] been so against that there's so such
[24:46] hatred for Israel that they miss the
[24:49] prophetic scriptures in literally in
[24:52] Jerusalem this is not a figure of speech
[24:55] this is not in heaven literally in
[24:59] Jerusalem we will come if you've never
[25:01] taken a trip to Jerusalem yet one day
[25:04] you
[25:05] will and you you won't need a jet to do
[25:08] it you'll have your own horse and you'll
[25:10] come down from heaven and you'll enter
[25:12] into the gates am with the Lord Jesus
[25:17] Christ right men shall dwell in it
[25:20] that's where peace will be it will C
[25:22] cover the Earth the knowledge of the
[25:25] Lord will cover the Earth Earth as the
[25:26] waters do the sea and it will come from
[25:29] where Mount Zion
[25:34] Jerusalem and this shall be the plague
[25:36] wherewith the Lord will Smite now that
[25:38] now he goes
[25:39] backwards right he talks about what the
[25:42] goal is and what's going to happen then
[25:43] he goes backwards this is how the war
[25:45] will be won this shall be the plague
[25:47] wherewith the Lord will Smite all the
[25:49] people that have fought against
[25:51] Jerusalem their flesh shall consume away
[25:53] while they stand upon their feet and
[25:56] their eyes shall consume away and their
[25:57] whole and their tongue shall consume
[26:00] away in their
[26:01] mouth and it shall come to pass in that
[26:04] day that a great tumult from the Lord
[26:06] shall be among them and they shall lay
[26:08] hold everyone on the hand of his
[26:10] neighbor and his hand shall rise up
[26:12] against the hand of his neighbor and
[26:14] Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem and
[26:17] the wealth of the Heathen round about
[26:20] shall be gathered together gold and S
[26:23] silver and a pear in great abundance
[26:28] and
[26:29] remember let me read this verse and so
[26:31] shall the plague be of the horse of the
[26:33] mule of the camel of the ass and of all
[26:36] the beasts that shall be in the tents as
[26:38] this plague all right so let me stop
[26:41] there for just a
[26:43] moment so remember that how does how
[26:48] does messiah defeat the
[26:53] Antichrist do you
[26:54] remember he he defeats him with what
[26:58] what's coming out of his mouth when he's
[27:00] on a on the sword what is a sword the
[27:04] word how does he defeat the Antichrist
[27:07] Isaiah 11 shows us that he defeats him
[27:10] with the breath of his
[27:12] lips so this is this this war that's
[27:16] taking place between these armies that
[27:19] gather against Israel is actually going
[27:22] to be won by the spoken word amen but
[27:25] I'll say this I don't believe it's just
[27:27] the anti
[27:28] the or the Messiah the Lord Jesus that
[27:31] speaks the
[27:33] word we will be fighting in the battle
[27:36] how will we fight the same thing by the
[27:39] spoken word and it will it will waste
[27:42] them away to
[27:44] nothing think about that for a minute so
[27:47] that's the plague that they that we
[27:50] Christ and his Saints will
[27:52] Smite the nations with
[27:55] amen and it shall come to pass that
[27:58] everyone now it's now it's fast forward
[28:01] again to the Millennium and it shall
[28:04] come to pass that everyone that is left
[28:06] of all the nations which came against
[28:08] Jerusalem shall even go up from year to
[28:10] year to worship the king the Lord of
[28:13] hosts and to keep the Feast of
[28:17] Tabernacles so there you have it it it
[28:19] this is this is the end result is that
[28:23] all the nations will be
[28:26] required to to Worship the Lord the word
[28:30] of the Lord will come forth who rules
[28:32] over the
[28:33] Nations Christ who else remember that
[28:37] we're we are to we are one of the
[28:39] rewards of the Bride is to rule over the
[28:42] nations with a rod of
[28:44] iron and
[28:46] so what are we being prepared for
[28:49] today think about that for a
[28:52] minute what is God's purpose for what
[28:54] you're going through today if you unless
[28:57] you suffer with him you cannot reign
[28:59] with
[29:00] him the the trials the tribulations the
[29:03] experience the faith that's growing the
[29:05] rapturing faith that's growing into us
[29:09] that's not just for the purpose of the
[29:11] Rapture there's purpose beyond that
[29:13] we're not just going to float on a cloud
[29:15] and play a harp we're going to a
[29:18] millennium amen where we do what rule
[29:22] over the nations with a rod of iron what
[29:24] does Jesus say in one of his rewards
[29:27] you've been faithful with this it'll be
[29:31] committed to you 10 cities 100 cities
[29:33] one city this is your reward think about
[29:37] that amen or Kings and Priests Kings of
[29:42] something it's not just a
[29:45] metaphor it's it's something that we're
[29:47] literally entering into that we're being
[29:49] prepared for that we're going to
[29:54] amen and it shall be that who so will
[29:56] not come up of all the families of the
[29:58] earth un Jerusalem to worship the king
[30:00] the Lord of hosts even upon them shall
[30:03] be no rain and if the family of Egypt go
[30:06] not up and come not that have no rain
[30:09] there shall be the plague wherewith the
[30:10] Lord will Smite the Heathen that come
[30:12] not up to keep the feasts of Tabernacles
[30:15] this shall be the punishment of Egypt
[30:17] and the punishment of all the nations
[30:18] that come not up to keep the Feast of
[30:21] Tabernacles in that day shall there be
[30:23] Bells upon shall there be upon the bells
[30:26] of the horses holiness under the Lord
[30:28] and the pots in the Lord's house shall
[30:31] be like the bowls before the altar yay
[30:34] um yeah yay every pot in Jerusalem and
[30:38] in Judah shall be Holiness unto the Lord
[30:41] and all they that sacrifice shall come
[30:43] and take of them and Seed therein and in
[30:45] that day there shall be no more
[30:47] Canaanite in the house of the Lord amen
[30:51] so you look at that and you're looking
[30:54] at the Millennium lots of questions
[30:56] arise what does it mean about a
[30:57] sacrifice and so on and so forth that's
[31:00] not our P purview to get into all those
[31:03] details here in you know five
[31:07] minutes but as as we look at this we see
[31:12] the purpose of God for Israel is
[31:14] ultimately a millennium amen right all
[31:18] Israel will be
[31:20] saved that doesn't mean every single
[31:22] person that's a citizen of the nation
[31:25] the only real Israel is the
[31:27] predestinated sea seed of Israel we
[31:29] emphasize this last the last few
[31:32] sessions that we've done
[31:33] this when Jesus was speaking he was
[31:36] speaking to to all
[31:38] Jews right he spoke to Pharisees
[31:43] Sadducees all of them
[31:46] and the common people and it wasn't it
[31:51] wasn't the people that he was speaking
[31:53] to that he called they were of their
[31:54] father the devil that was the religious
[31:57] leaders that for jealousy couldn't
[32:00] receive him the most religious people in
[32:03] the nation of Israel are not the ones
[32:05] that are going to receive it's the it's
[32:07] the same thing it's the common man it's
[32:11] the common people that will hear the
[32:13] message the same people will reject the
[32:18] same high religious black suit guys they
[32:21] already have their
[32:23] interpretation of this Rabbi from
[32:26] Brooklyn he's there Messiah if you go
[32:28] around every almost every business on
[32:32] the back of all the signs it has
[32:34] pictures of the Reb that's what they
[32:36] call him he's just the Reb which means
[32:37] the rabbi and those people that are
[32:40] wearing the black suits and the black
[32:42] hat 95% of them believe that he's the
[32:47] Messiah and this is how he will return
[32:49] cuz he's dead by the way this is how he
[32:53] will come back from the dead and rule
[32:54] over Israel is they will get good and
[32:57] enough in God's sight they will achieve
[33:01] enough
[33:02] Holiness then the Reb will come
[33:06] back and will set up a kingdom over the
[33:08] Nations see they've already
[33:11] rejected the prophetic scriptures just
[33:14] like the Gentiles they're watching and
[33:17] looking for a Rapture to take place
[33:20] worldwide of every person that confesses
[33:22] Christ and little clothes are going to
[33:24] be laying on the side of the street
[33:27] they're looking for this fantastic
[33:29] nothing happens nothing happens nothing
[33:30] happens suddenly there's a Rapture out
[33:32] of nowhere that's their idea of what
[33:35] it's going to be and totally missing yes
[33:37] amen that there's there has to be a
[33:39] seventh star there has there there has
[33:42] to be a fulfillment you you try to tell
[33:44] them about seven Church
[33:46] ages they say that's that's one
[33:49] interpretation of
[33:50] it we don't look at it that way that's
[33:54] just the condition of every church if
[33:55] you look and see every Church every
[33:57] church will be like one of those seven
[33:59] churches and so it's an admonishment to
[34:01] all of all of us and they come up with
[34:04] their own understanding no no Malachi 4
[34:07] that's just only for the Jews couldn't
[34:10] possibly be a gentile Prophet couldn't
[34:13] possibly be Revelation 10 that's for uh
[34:17] Israel that has nothing to do with the
[34:20] Gentiles see they've made they've pre
[34:24] pre- rejected the Christ they they pre-
[34:28] rejected the manifestation of the spirit
[34:30] in their midst see they don't they don't
[34:32] want it they' refused it they come up so
[34:35] far and then that's that's as far as
[34:37] they want to go and the same exact
[34:40] principle will happen in Israel they
[34:42] come up so far well these two
[34:45] prophets they're not they're not they're
[34:47] not
[34:48] hidic this so they possibly couldn't
[34:51] possibly be they're not Ultra
[34:53] Orthodox they couldn't possibly be
[34:55] they're preaching about Jes Jesus as the
[34:58] Messiah Jesus as a blasphemer in their
[35:01] minds they've pre- rejected the word and
[35:05] so what is it there's going to be a
[35:07] Remnant the predestinated seed a
[35:10] minority that will receive it actually
[35:12] it'll be a lot more people than received
[35:14] it the first time
[35:16] right it'll be for it'll be glorious
[35:19] compared to the first time the first
[35:22] time 120 went to the upper room right
[35:26] out of all Israel that's I don't even
[35:29] know if it's one tenth of
[35:31] 1% of Israel that went to the upper room
[35:34] of course many were saved after that but
[35:36] still several
[35:39] thousand and it's going to be 144,000
[35:42] Amen in the tribulation period so it's
[35:44] quite quite astounding the Revival that
[35:46] will take place there and yet it still
[35:49] will be a vast minority of Jewish people
[35:52] that will receive it the majority will
[35:54] reject it the majority have already
[35:56] taken sides with the anti Antichrist
[35:58] right
