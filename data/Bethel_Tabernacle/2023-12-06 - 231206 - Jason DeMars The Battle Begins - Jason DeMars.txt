I'm going to change the order of the service over it's just a little chorus that I've sung here it's been a few years back kefc sister Deb and um I've just been singing it in my spirit over the last

Lord so if you can put that scripture up everyone will be able to see the lyrics it's on Psalms 8611 oh praise the Lord except um no that's not what I'm looking for is that 11 Psalms 8611 it's just a

sing it one more time as brother Jason comes te teach me thy way oh [Music] Lord and I will walk in thy [Music] truth you not My Heart To Fear Thy Name teach me thy way oh Lord father we just look to you yes amen know you're the same yesterday today and forever the same God that was there in the form of Jesus Christ same God that was manifested in the life of brother brandham is the same God that's here in our midst Lord to meet every need that we have all we have to do is believe your promise receive your promise just accept that it's it's not only true but it's for me right in my situation so we Look to You Lord we ask that your Holy Spirit would come take your word Lord and write it upon our hearts that's all our desire is Lord which you promised that you would do that Lord if wherever two or three were gathered together you'd come your presence would be here Lord and your purpose Lord is to write your word in our hearts Lord that we be would be CH changed and transformed to be a reflection of Jesus Christ in this hour so we commit this time unto that even now Lord For Your Glory we ask in jesus' name amen God bless you Saints if you want to bring up the PowerPoint back there for me I'm going to speak on the subject of the battle begins I was thinking upon my life as a young convert receiving the Holy Ghost and uh when I received the Holy Ghost that's when the battle a whole new war that I knew nothing about amen started in my life and that's where that's where it begins when you get the Holy Ghost a battle's coming a fight's coming but you have the tools to be Victorious now amen before that you didn't once you get the Holy Ghost now you're subject to winning the war amen all right so let's turn in the scriptures uh Romans chapter 7 7 we'll just read here and let you have your seat but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity into the law of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but but with the flesh the law of sin may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon your soul is a personal experience that each of us must have yes amen it makes us a new creature in Christ a new creation in Christ it puts us into the body of Christ and it's identified by Leading us into all truth brother bham taught us that that he said it's not speaking in tongues and it's not love but it's being led into all truth amen and so as a result along with that the the fruit of the spirit begin to be increasingly produced and formed in your life and you're also because you're a body part of the body of Christ you're subject to the gifts of the Spirit amen when you receive that baptism of the Holy Ghost upon your Soul uh now you're a newborn babe in Christ you feed on milk right when you're a newborn babe but you need to grow increasingly so that you can come to the place where you're feeding on strong meat amen right that's God's goal is to increase us those who are of full age eat strong meat yeah so that's the age that we're living in he's growing us into that place of perfection or completion or maturity now I I was I was studying this and I was praying this morning and uh this this picture began to form in my mind and I begin to think of of the type that the Holy Ghost is a type of not heaven or the promised land is not a type of heaven but the promised land is a type of the Holy Ghost so I began to study this and think about this and so I want to just first establish what kind of battle is taking place when you have received the Holy Ghost so let's look at some quotes brother brandham in questions and answers says and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live amen but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all the sin is gone from you see that's the thing so you have two of those things going on at the same time once you're born again you are forgiven but not only forgiven you're Justified your sins are cast into the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered no more and at the very same time you still have a sinful nature in your flesh am that's battling against the holy ghost in your life and there is a process of this battle and V and victory that needs to happen within us amen he says but on in questions and answers number one 1954 but I'm backsliding remember you backslide every day yeah no way at all for you to keep out of it all right but you backslide to the people but not before God see you backslide on Christ but you don't on God because if you would when you sin you're gone but you're constantly falling Paul had to die every day is that right he had to die every day repent every day and just constantly repenting all the time see if Paul had to do that then I'm going to have to too aren't you yes that's right amen see that's a brother brandom there speaking of himself I backslide every day constantly all right so are we supposed to just stay in that condition are we supposed to just be content with backsliding every day well brother Bram said I backslide every day so just fine I'm going to keep on doing no that's not the attitude of a Christian right after that he says he had to die every day repent every day so the backsliding is not a condition that we want to surrender ourselves to we want to surrender ourselves to the power of God moving in our lives to convict us and to draw us closer to Christ so that we would be a reflection of him not a reflection of continuous backsliding am nevertheless understand you're not perfect in the sense of flawless sinful sinlessness you're still going to have that and that will always be there that's right that's why the Bible says draw near to God he'll draw near to you James 4:8 says that cleanse your hands you Sinners purify your hearts yeah you double-minded so those are the things that we as Believers need to do we have a problem sometimes we get double-minded that's what backsliding is it's becoming double-minded you have two things that are going on one one law in is working in you that you want to do what's pleasing to the Lord another law is working in you to battle against that law to prevent you from doing that so purify your your hearts cleanse yourselves draw near to God and he'll draw near to you I want to talk about that for just one moment what does that mean draw near to God he'll draw near to you it's not as though it's like like well the Holy Spirit we we sin and the Holy Spirit leaves us no you're sealed until the day of your Redemption but what really is it is the influence of the Holy Spirit as we backslide if we don't if we cut off that process of repenting we just backslide backslide backslide with no repentance that's when we push the influence of the Holy Spirit brother Bram says the dove leaves and goes and sits on the tree up up there waiting for you to repent now the Holy Ghost don't doesn't leave you you're sealed until the day of redemption but the influence of the Holy Ghost has been cut off from you because of this unrepented of sin in your life and so that's where we're double-minded that's why we need to be cleansed that's why we need to purify our hearts and especially in that first we have to draw near to God because in drawing near to God then his presence his influence is there in your life you know when you spend more time in prayer when you spend more time reading the Bible feeding on the word that is where the influence of the holy spirit is most strong but when you stop doing that I'm busy I got everything going on that's when the influence of the Holy Spirit gets lower and lower and you walk in unrepented of sin amen two Natures fighting inside of you amen all right the Bible says now this is a question questions a question from uh uh questions and answers in 1961 the Bible says that everything works for the good to them that love the Lord then if you love God and turn back to the world would God let you die in sin or would he let you be reconciled back to him before he takes you away the lady signed her name to it so I'd say it was a lady see cuz she signed her name yes sister if let me get this see temporarily minor every one of us back slide many times a day we know that we're all guilty every one of us there's none of us perfect perfected and as long as we're in this body no matter how much the people try to tell I got Sanctified I can kiss this woman or do that he's lying he cannot now that's all amen I don't I try don't try to say Lord let me see how close I can go it's Lord keep me as far away as I can get see just as far away as remember you're still human being see and now but now if you make a mistake and do something wrong you don't willfully uh if you're if you're a born again Christian you don't mean to do wrong your intentions and everything is right but if you do as she said here make a mistake and do something wrong will God let you just go on and go on and die like that and be lost or will he bring you back to reconciliation Hallelujah he will bring you back that's right he will bring you back and if uh then if you do anything wrong it don't condemn you you and you go on like that on out remember you wasn't saved at the beginning wow that's good that's right you you wasn't saved you just had a make belief you wasn't saved but when you're saved you have a different Spirit you have a different nature you're a new creature in Christ and the old things has passed away and they are dead and buried in the sea of forgetfulness GL you see all right amen where am I at up there thank you uh and but being you're living here in this world there's traps set for you everywhere and you're walking with your eyes on Christ and remember that when you make a mistake a real Christian will always come back quickly for reconciliation amen all right there we go look in the ark God turned the old crow out or Noah turned the crow out now what was he he was a crow oh yes he sat on the same Roose there with the dove they both sat in the same Roose but when he turned the old crow up well imagine all the water was stinking with millions of people's swelled bodies rottening up upon the top top the water and horses and animals all dead my what a picture the whole world was destroyed and there was this old dead carcasses floating on top of the water and things like that and Noah turned the dove out cu he guessed he saw some sunshine and he wanted to know whether the water water had receded or not so he turned the crow out and the old crow flew down on on an old dead body my just fine that's good so see eating a dead body why that was his nature he was a crow no matter how much he'd set with the dove how much he'd heard Noah preach how much he'd set with this clean bird he was a crow to begin with and as soon as he got the opportunity to show his colors he showed it now but when he turned the dove out when she started outo she couldn't stand that nowhere she could go she couldn't find no rest for the souls of her feet so she' come back to the ark that's the way it is sometimes he might be turned loose for a little while to see what you do but you'll always if you got the nature of a dove you cannot eat crows food that's all it just won't digest that's all amen what a beautiful thing that brother brandham speaks there is will the Lord will if if I'm in a condition where I backslide and I fall and I and I and I go away uh will will I just be left in that condition and brother B you're not going to leave you he's going to go after you and he's going to bring you back but H what's the then he goes on to explain how that works how will he bring you back this is how he brings you back you have your desire that is in you that you can't keep feeding on that garbage out there you got to come to a place where you're going to start feeding back on the word again because that's the nature inside of you that other nature is there and sometimes we feed it too much that's where we go the wrong way but if you're a Son of God God is going to convict you and you're going to go through the process you're going to say I backslid you're going to get on your knees before God and you're going to repent but it's that nature it's that desire that's inside of you that God has put there when you're young in the faith that desire is not super strong it's strong it's it can be very strong but yet there's this place where also the desire of the flesh is strong the nature of the flesh is strong so these two things are Waring against each other and you fall and you get up and you keep going and you fall and you keep up get up and you keep going that's the process that's normal you're a newborn babe does a toddler run and jump and do the triple jump and play uh in the NFL no no they first have to learn how to do all that they'll fall they'll stumble they'll struggle struggle it'll be difficult but they'll just keep getting up and doing it until they're able to shoot a basketball see so that's that's what we do as Christians keep going keep going get up keep going what of course you failed what are you talking about you have another nature inside of you that's at war against that brother brandom says you'll backslide every day so then you need to repent every day set that in your mind as a Christian every single day don't be so proud of yourself I don't need to repent I'm a Christian I doubt your experience in the first place if that's your attitude the place right here if you have that attitude is right at the altar to get your heart right with the Lord because that's right a real Christian recognizes his own weakness and is broken yeah over his own weakness amen and thirst 1965 brother Bram says for instance the flesh thirst to satisfy the desires that's in the body and the spirit desires for the things that's in the soul desires many times these War one against another we find there what's a great trouble today that too many people try to live between these two desires for one of them desires the things of the Earth the other desires the things of Heaven like Paul said describes in Romans 7:21 when I would do good the evil then evil is die when you try did you ever have that in experience Christians that when you're trying to do something that's worthwhile go to make an effort to do something that's good then you find out that there is the devil on every hand just to upset you everything that You' and and that's one good thing I'd like to say this that the Christian might know then when you are when you are starting to do something then there is something always trying to upset you you in doing it to do it anyhow amen that's the devil there trying to keep you from doing what's right amen isn't that beautiful amen now I want to bring two things and then we're going to go into our typology Hebrews 10:14 I want to keep the keep these things in order for by one offering he's perfected forever them that are Sanctified amen so let's let's bring this together this word is Sanctified uh is not a finished tense this tense is an ongoing tense in other words for them that are being Sanctified is how you would understand this this word so it you are perfected forever if you're being Sanctified think about that so this one is in experience and one is God's declaration God has declared over you you are perfected forever amen it's our conscience right he's perfected our conscience he's changed our nature he's changed our desires he's taken our sins he's cast them in the sea of forgetfulness remember there's there's two parts to the New Covenant you think about that there's two parts of the New Covenant and we can you can read that in Hebrews chapter 10 you can read that in Jeremiah uh chapter 31 I believe it is I get those mixed up 31 or 34 either one just read them both it'll be good for you um but what what is it he says I will write my law in your heart and in your mind and he says I'll remember your sins and iniquities no more right here is showing both of those things being Sanctified is God God writing his word in our hearts and in our minds okay perfected forever is remembering our sins and iniquities no more both of them come by the blood of Jesus Christ but one of them is an ongoing work as long as you're here in this body as long as you're as up up until the Rapture amen you're going to be going through this process of God writing his word on your heart yeah all right thank you however he you'll already have every one of your sins cast into the sea of forgetfulness and he remembers them no more so that's a that's a finished work thank you so the identification of you having the finished work in your life is that the ongoing work is going on in your life God is leading you into all truth in other words he's writing the word in your heart so if God is writing the word in your heart and changing you conforming you to the nature of Christ that means your sins are already in the sea of forgetfulness I no notice there I never said you are a finished product you never make mistakes you never mess up no what it is is he is changing me he is working in my life he's taking the message of the hour and he's wri it in my hearted in my mind and I'm growing into Christ amen Philippians 212 wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed this is one of my favorite scriptures I me I mention it all the time uh it's just to me these two scriptures together so encapsulate the sovereignty of God and our surrender to his will wherefore my beloved as you've always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling amen amen all right so work out your own salvation with fear and trembling we look at this and we think my goodness how could I ever work out my own salvation but remember salvation is never something that you achieve salvation is a gift by grace are you saved through faith that not of yourselves the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast has nothing to do with you working salvation is given to you as a gift however you're told to work out what you've already received all right but when we're talking about working out what you've already received with fear and trembling it's not like you are it's you doing it alog together God has supplied the materials so think about it this way work out you could you could say when you have an equation in math you work out the answer 2 + x = 4 so how do you how how do you figure out that well 2 + 2 equal 4 now I have worked out salvation so now you're taking the elements that God has provided and supplied for you and you're letting them accomplish what he desires in your life amen see and this goes perfectly along with what is happening next because he says for or because it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure goes perfectly along with the New Covenant goes perfectly along with the verse that we just read in Hebrews how how are we working this out working out our salvation with fear and trembling it's God working in us to Will and to do of his good pleasure he is doing a work in us we surrender right to that work that he is doing and and just the fact we have to it's an ongoing process when you look at this he is working to Will and to do of his good pleasure this isn't a one-time thing it's not a one-time event it's not when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost that just starts the process that begins the process then this is what happens see this happening is evidence that that has happened see you have an experience with God experience of God produces something in your life it produces transformation it produces the life of Jesus Christ amen all right so now I want to get into looking at typing out our walk in the Holy Ghost with the promised land I began to look at this brother bham says as I was with Moses so I will be with thee 1960 it's it's uh he says oh I got to stop here on something just a moment won't take me but a minute many people refer to the promised land to the m Millenium if you study this and look at this in your in the table you'll see many people includes brother Bram up to this point all right and I think there's a reason for that and we'll study this but he says many uh refers to that to the pro Promised Land of the Millennium it is not the promised land had Wars and killings the Millennium won't have any wars or killings it referred to the Holy Spirit the Battlegrounds amen amen so as I began to think about this and study this I realized okay if that if the promised land is a type of the Holy Spirit the Battleground then we can go go and begin to look at Joshua and judges and Samuel and type it out and see how this goes forward all right so we're going to do that we're going to spend the rest of our most of the rest of our time looking at this so Joshua 1 2 Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan so that's passing over into the promised land amen thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses amen from the Wilderness in this Lebanon even under the Great River the river Euphrates now they've never ever had this much land they they've not the Great River the the small River to all the way to the Sea yes they've had that but even that it's been a small time that they've had it yeah from the Wilderness in Lebanon into the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper with soever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withs soever thou goest amen then then Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying pass through the hosts and command the people saying prepare you victuals for within three days you shall pass over this Jordan to go into to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you to possess so as we study and look at this they're just about to go into the promised land they're on the other side of the Jordan and they're told be prepared for war and battle it's going to be a war it's going to be challenges to your faith there's going to be difficulties and trials you don't say be strong and courageous if it's just going to be simple and easy amen amen you you're you say be strong and courageous because it's going to be difficult it's going to be many hardships many trials so this is the preparation that's given to them be strong and courageous do not fear the promise God is with you wherever you go remember the word that's been given to you meditate on the word that was delivered to you obey that same word which has been given to you again the promised land a type of the Holy Ghost these are the instructions they're going in to receive the Holy Ghost so these are the things when you enter don't forget we need the word we need strength we need courage because it's a battle it's a war we need to remain strong you won't take the land you won't have Victory if you stay timid if you stay weak you have to take the word and you have to feed on it continually if you don't meditate on it day and night you will never have victory in the land that's true wow it's a real Battleground we got to take the word and we got to feed on it we got to be courageous and we got to obey the word because that actually right there is where the victory is if you walk in obedience to the word God will be with you and he will achieve the victory through you amen won't achieve the victory for you but he will achieve the victory through you now the promised La Land battle begins but it was a battle that was to lead them to rest I want you to notice I believe brother brandom speaks about the promised land is a journey to the Millennium yeah I was looking at that it's a journey to the Millennium so if if it's a the promised land is a type of the Holy Ghost us receiving the Holy Ghost is then our journey to the Millennium amen and as I was looking at this I began to see brother brandham says this in 1957 God manifesting his gifts now Solomon's age that he was referring to was the Millennium for the Jews it was the golden age as historians know for the Jewish people Solomon was a four type of Christ in that he built the temple and so so the the Holy Ghost is where we receive it when we go into the land amen right we go into battle we fight to take the land and the ultimate that that the ultimate that we're going to achieve in our fighting is entering into rest amen amen and so Solomon being that type you go through the history of Israel the time of Conquest the time of Judges the time of the first kings that came and up to Solomon and the rest that the people had for a short period of time thank God we won't have a rest for a short period of time Hallelujah so they crossed into the land under Joshua in the springtime the river parted for them to get into the land great Supernatural experience crossing the river into the baptism of the Holy Ghost first thing that happens once they get into the land into the promised land is the new generation is immediately circumcised as they enter the land being a type of even there of receiving the Holy Ghost the new generation must be circumcised the new generation must receive the Holy Ghost they can't go in on their parents' experience they have to go in on their own experience am next thing that you see is they meet Jericho uh they come under the the leadership of the angel of Jehovah's armies and Jericho they listen to The Voice voice of God through the angel of Jehovah and they destroy Jericho and the and the the land is under great fear because they're walking in steps remember steps means possession so they're taking possession of their promise they're walking through the land taking possession of their promise but as they're taking possession of their promise uh-oh they take possession of too much amen now we have a and he grabs the detestable thing the Abomination an idol of gold it's a cursed thing they go to battle my think about this they were so zealous they went to battle if they would have done it correctly they would have went to God and God would have said you have sin in the camp you can't win the victory get rid of the sin instead they March forward without in immaturity in babyhood they March forward and they're defeated oh mercy type remember this is a type of the Holy Ghost yeah you say my goodness you're you're saying there's defeat you can be defeated when you have the Holy Ghost yeah sir but notice the Hol God doesn't abandon them because they're his predestinated seed and he says they they turn to him and say God what what happened well why didn't you do that before you did that before the problem be solved you did it afterwards you got people killed because of this you made a mistake yeah you sinned now they've got to repent now they've got to make it right before God and kill that sin in the camp and everything associated with that sin just burn it with fire now they can go forward into battle and now they'll have victory over the enemy amen praise the Lord they didn't give up they dealt with the sin yeah they repented they attacked again and they won next they run into some people depending pretending to be from on a long journey long distance and say oh uh we want to make peace with you we heard what God has done with you and we're from a long ways away be at peace with us oh they say oh man that's awesome God is really blessing us here uh sure we'll make peace with you guys what did they forget to do you have the Holy Ghost you still can't just run forward like you know everything like you got it all figured out ask God what to do on every step if you have the real Holy Ghost God's going to direct you back even if you don't do it the first time he's going to create the circumstances and the situation where you go okay I humbl myself Lord I I I made a mistake I've done something stupid help me notice God doesn't abandon them through this they made a they made a terrible mistake they never should have done that they're supposed to destroy the gibit and it became a thorn in their flesh from that now as we go forward the sun stands still the five kings are killed much land is conquered Joshua gets old even when he's still old it says there's still much land to possess but they begin to settle down and smaller scale conquests continue continue Caleb takes his land the tribes get their land allotted Cities of Refuge are selected pasture lands and cities are given to the Levites through the tribal areas at the end of Joshua Joshua's life he renews he reminds them of the Covenant he reminds them of what they're supposed to be doing yeah and he reminds them of the command that God gave him at the beginning obey the law of Moses o uh follow the word meditate on it day and night be strong and rageous take the land Drive the people out of the land stay with the word that the prophet brought you obey the word completely amen if you don't drive the Nations out if you don't drive the sin out of out of your life it's going to be a snare to you and a thorn in your flesh as long as you live amen and it'll be a trap sir for you to take your heart away from God that's right then we go through the judg Judes my goodness here's the summary of the judges nevertheless the Lord raised up judges which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them and yet they would not hearken unto their judges but they went a whoring after other gods and bowed themselves unto them they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying the Commandments of the Lord but they did but they did not so and when the Lord raised them up judges then the Lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them and it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers and following other gods to serve them and to bow down unto them they ceased not from their own doings nor from their stubborn way and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel and he said because that this people has transgressed my Covenant which I commanded their fathers have not hearkened unto my voice I will I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the Nations which Joshua left when he died that through them I may prove Israel whether they will keep the way of the Lord to walk therein as their fathers did Keep It or Not therefore the Lord left those Nations without driving them out hastily neither deliver delivered he them into the hand of Joshua my goodness so we look and we see through all of this ups and downs struggles and trials Hearts waxing cold heart hearts getting on fire again up and down backslide the backsliding of Israel continual backsliding amen and we can all come into that condition this this is the promised land even in the Holy Ghost we all come into that place of ups and downs and our hearts gets cold and turns away from God and then God sends a Deliverance to us amen sends a message to us and changes and touches our heart and transforms us even further and and again and refills us that's why we need refilling of the Holy Ghost you see God sends a new judge it's like a refilling of the Holy Ghost and it renews them and they keep going going for forward and all of a sudden they start getting cold and their faith gets weak and God refills them again amen than you Lord questions and answers brother Brandon is asked is it possible for a holy ghost filled person to be driven by driven by to do minor things influenced to do minor things that he doesn't want to do oh yes sir yeah a holy ghost filled person you're right in the place then to be drove by these things you just put yourself up a Target when you're down there serving the devil he just lets you slouch around any way you want to but you once take a stand for Christ you've got on the other side then he trains every gun right around on you every Temptation everything that could be thrown at you then you got it but what have you got greater is he that's in you that's he that's in the world see now you wasn't in no battle here you was just flopping along see but now you've you've cleaned up you've dressed up you've shaved you've combed your hair you put on a uniform you got a gun in your hand let's go see you're in the battle not to show off but to fight fight sure when The Temptations rise when the spirit The Shield of Faith uh Buck bucket off and move on see that's right oh put the whole armor of God why do you put on Armor if you're not going to fight all the soldiers are dressed to fight not to show off walk out and say I'm so and so now I'm a Christian see who I am I belong to so and so Hallelujah I got the Holy Ghost the other night sure another nothing bothers me every more huh huh oh brother I believe you better go back and try again all right amen oh I'm telling you when as soon as you say you got the Holy Ghost Satan's got every gun right on you shooting you then you got the whole armor then take the shield of Faith the sword of the spirit or the word take the Buckle shot yourself with the gospel and take the old middle piece here the breastplate and pull up the Cinch on it tighten yourself up a little bit and get ready for it cuz it's coming don't you worry yes sir you're going to have plenty of trouble don't you worry you're going to have plenty of trouble but remember greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world amen amen so then we come to the time of Samuel and the people wanted a man to lead them instead and they chose out a king but then God chose a king a man after his own heart David still being a type under the baptism of the Holy Ghost they're still Conquering the promised land he would not he could not build the millennial Temple right and I understand many types and there's different directions you can go with the temple we're a type of the temple our body is a temple of the Holy Ghost but looking at it in that sense just in this sense he couldn't build the temple why because he was a man of blood and War but David finally subdued the land 2 Samuel 8 shows us David had a great campaign aggressive campaign of War to take full control finally David said this is it I'm done with all these little skirmishes and these fights we are going to go to war and we are going to sub subdue this enemy and we're not going to deal with this nonsense anymore so he subdues the Philistines Moab zoba the syrians Ammon amalec Edom they all pay tribute to David finally they have rest now David says we have rest I'm going to build a temple God says you're not going to do that then he called for Solomon his son and charged him to build a house for the Lord God of Israel and David said to Solomon my son as for me it was in my mind to build a house under the name of the Lord my God see they finally got to the place where they had peace now they're fixing to enter into rest enter into Millennium but they couldn't do it under David a man of war and blood it had to be the change of dispensation to Solomon it was in my mind to build a house under the name of the Lord my God but the word of the Lord came to me saying thou H has shed blood abundantly and has made great Wars Thou shalt not build a house under my name because thou has shed much blood upon the Earth in my sight Behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest and I will give him rest from all his enemies roundabout for his name shall be Solomon and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel uh in his days he shall build a house for my name and he shall be my son and I will be his father and I will establish the Throne of his kingdom over Israel forever Solomon is just a type of Christ This Promise that's spoken is spoken to Solomon in type of the ultimate fulfillment of this is the Lord Jesus Christ who will have a kingdom in Israel in the Millennium it will be forever and he'll be he'll anoint the the the millennial Temple amen and he he will rule over that and that will be the time of rest that is the re that is part of our reward for being in the battles in taking the promised land yes amen Philippians 1:6 now we think about this all the ups and downs that Israel went through all the mistakes that they made all the failures that they went through I can go back and look at my own life oh yeah I was going to say you can go back but I'm just going to talk about myself I can go back and look at all the mistakes that I made all the failures I made all the times my heart got cold all the times I got backslid amen wasn't feeding on the word and I can say God never left me in that condition he did something in me that caused me to repent and turn and go in the right direction why because he gave me the Holy Ghost yeah why did he give me the Holy Ghost because I was in his mind before the foundation of the world so I had the Holy Ghost he's never going to let me go even though it seems like I'm letting go too much oh yeah too often and we get to that place and we F we think uh how how can I it possibly be that I could make it how could it possibly be that I could go in the Rapture that I could be saved well the reality is you can't and why why we ever get to our minds that the devil speaks to us this way and it it's at some point in our life when the devil starts speaking it this way you're going to laugh the Lord has helped me to reach that place and I don't know I don't know how it happened but it came to that place the devil shows me you're not worthy you you've done this you've done this thanks for the reminder Hallelujah not worthy I never could be worthy I never could work my way into it it's only by the blood of Jesus Christ that I can appear before the presence of God and it's only by the faith that God has given me it's not even my own faith it's the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me so we can be confident of this very thing that he which beg a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ praise God see this is what God was doing God was showing in Israel you amen God never he never left them and never abandoned them even though they abandoned him over and over again he never abandoned him abandoned them he still hasn't even though it might look like it to the world God has never he's he's written them on the palm of his hand amen it's engraven with an iron tool and it can't be removed no matter what and so you that's your name there it's not just Israel's name it's your name that's written there and so he is going to finish the work but he wants to do it through you not just merely for you see wow he wants to move in your life in a way so that you have over come you have taken the the what he has supplied to you and you've surrendered to his purpose of his spirit and his word and you're walking in both of those things you need both of those things to go forward if you don't have both of those things you're missing something with both of those things there's Victory amen amen Romans 8:17 and 18 and if children then heirs HS of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we we may be also glorified together so there is a part of our walk with we have to suffer with him we have to go through trials difficulties tribulations that is the place that we're Overcomers yes that's right we can't be glorified together with Christ unless we suffer with him unless the guns of the enemy are trained on you yes you'll never be glorified with him that is a part an important part of our experience that's where the Holy Ghost in us and the word that we're feeding on is tried and tested so that we can show the power that that word has in overcoming amen for I reckon that the suffering of this present time the sufferings of the Conquering of the present the the promised land are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US amen the same God that led the children of Israel into the promised land of the Holy Ghost where Wars failures victories great Supernatural experiences Deliverance took place will also lead us to that Millennium under the ultimate son of David Hallelujah let's look let's look again um I'm just about to close I guess brother Tim borrowed the time from me so we'll uh we'll just shave off a little bit here for him on Sunday so if we look at this the Holy Ghost Promised Land Battle it shows you'll face deception you might fall but you won't fall permanently right amen God will take care of that he'll correct you and set you up on your feet now you say the elect cannot be deceived Jason dears how can you say that the elect cannot be deceived okay so you the minute you were born again you had every Doctrine perfectly right you understood all everything from start to finish you never made a mistake in how you understood everything that brother br said you're laughing why are you laughing isn't that true it's not true you can you can in your walk but ultimately God will see to it that his people are not deceived amen that's right God take God will take care of that he'll correct you it just depends on how painful it wants you want it to be and he'll set you up on your feet amen and he'll help you continue walking you'll face battles that are lost because of sin but God will take care of that too and he'll correct you and he'll set you on your feet you'll face ups and downs and backsliding against God you'll face failures and defeats you'll have great victories you'll see the supernatural power go of God at work in your life yeah you'll be ultimately you're going to be victorious you'll be an overcomer because that's the direction that God is leading his people and you're one of them amen he's leading you into the millennial rest amen that's what he gave you the holy ghost in the first place for right each age a part of the word is allotted to that age what does that mean it means that there's a people on the Earth that are receiving that word and that it's not just the word is preached in that age well well that's nice but for what purpose there's got to be a purpose that the word is sent for and the word is to go from the the mouth of the preacher into the hearts of the people so that something is accomplished in their life in that particular age so the word is sent in our age and is allotted to this age the fullness of the word so the fullness of the word is to achieve what the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ in you so if that's what God has allotted to this age then buckle up that's what he's going to do in you that's what he's going to accomplish in you musicians if you'd come 1 Peter 4:12 says beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing has happened unto you it wasn't strange that the children of Israel went into the promised land and met enemies right wasn't that to be expected yes sir isn't that what you're prepared to do when you get the Holy Ghost don't be surprised that you're going to face enemies amen that's right because that's the whole point is you're to conquer those enemies so that you can become a reflection of Jesus Christ brother bamman God of this evil age says we find now this evil age is to prove to Satan she the bride is not like Eve that she is not that type of a woman and she'll be Tried by his word the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the word so we'll be Tried by the word but we're going to prove that we're not going to fall like Eve did like the other Church ages did but that will stay true to the fullness of the word and that will actually be a manifestation of the fullness of that that word amen let's bow our head let's stand and bow our heads I just want you to take [Music] a take a few minutes as we as we bow just to consider these things and consider what God is doing in your life and I just want to take a moment just to consecrate myself and let's take a minute to consecrate ourselves to the Lord because it's a battle that each one of us are facing when the Holy Ghost moves in your life we've had meetings and the spirit of God has moved in so many different hearts and done so many different wonderful things and we can know that when the Holy Ghost moves like that that the battle is coming and I believe we need to enem is going to try to discourage you make you think that well it's just emotion it was just something that happened and now now I have these struggles and these battles and oh maybe I didn't get anything no that's a that's an error let's just consecrate ourselves amen father we just bow our hearts and bow our heads Lord to you knowing the battles that each one of us is facing in this walk through the Promised Land Lord and we we just want to take take this time and just Lord we want to renew our hearts to you yes we want to consecrate ourselves again to this this fight and this battle we have the tools we've been delivered the tools to achieve Victory Lord we Just Surrender
