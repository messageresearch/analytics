[30:35] Saturate

[30:57] [music]
[30:58] I need you now.
[31:02] Pour your [music] spirit
[31:05] out.
[31:08] Amen. God bless you [music] this
[31:09] morning. Turn around, shake somebody's
[31:11] hand, greet them in the name of the
[31:13] Lord. Happy to have you all here in the
[31:16] house [music] of God today. Amen.
[31:21] Praise the Lord.
[31:28] Amen.
[31:30] God bless you. [clears throat] Amen.
[31:34] We're happy to have you all in the house
[31:35] of God today [music] and um want to give
[31:38] you greetings in the name of the Lord
[31:39] and glad that uh most of that storm is
[31:43] passing all above us. We're um want to
[31:45] be in prayer for there's churches all
[31:49] across a big old band of believers. But
[31:52] I know that God knows where every one of
[31:54] his children are. And I just know that
[31:56] the Lord cares. Amen. He has
[31:58] demonstrated that over the years.
[32:00] [music] Amen. Praise the Lord. Happy to
[32:02] have the boys in from Clemson today.
[32:04] Papa had to turn some screws, but I got
[32:06] it done. [laughter]
[32:08] Amen. Praise the Lord. I had to be cool
[32:10] about it though because, you know, I
[32:12] didn't want to try to act like I was
[32:13] ordering him around. Although, they
[32:14] would have did it if I'd have ordered
[32:16] them, but I didn't want to make it like
[32:17] that. So, I was [music] just trying to
[32:19] help mom and dad get them home. I think
[32:20] mom and dad just wanted to see them.
[32:22] Amen. So, uh, but I said, "Hey, man. You
[32:24] don't want to be snowed in without power
[32:27] and [clears throat] Door Dash won't be
[32:29] running. [laughter]
[32:31] Uh, Uber Eats won't be running. You have
[32:33] no power and no food." and uh [music]
[32:35] Noah said, "Okay, we're [laughter]
[32:39] Amen." So, we're [clears throat] happy
[32:41] to have them here today.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Praise the Lord.
[32:46] Um so, I just want to be in [music]
[32:48] prayer. Oh, yeah. Sure enough. Um
[32:52] a lot of power is out. I'm getting
[32:54] notices um up in Tennessee and some
[32:56] different places like that. [music]
[32:58] Amen. We trust our um stream will stay
[33:01] okay today. We may have a number of
[33:03] streamers [music]
[33:04] from cancelled service. If so, God bless
[33:06] you. Amen. Um, the backbone of [music]
[33:08] our stream goes right through Atlanta.
[33:10] And if that has a problem, sometimes it
[33:12] can create a problem for us here. So
[33:15] hopefully everything will [music] stay
[33:16] steady. Amen. And uh, we'll be good to
[33:18] go on the stream. We're going to invite
[33:20] you to Philippians chapter [music] 2
[33:22] this morning.
[33:24] And um I want to
[33:28] [snorts] take today as we've [music]
[33:30] kind of become cussed at the calling it
[33:32] kind of my own personal state of the
[33:35] union address. I do it the beginning of
[33:37] every year. I don't always do it on the
[33:39] first weekend of January, but I try to
[33:41] do it at least within the month. And it
[33:43] just gives me an opportunity to kind of
[33:46] open my heart up to you all in a
[33:48] personal way. And um you know no service
[33:51] is complete without the the gospel and
[33:54] the reading of the word and and
[33:55] exhortation on the word of God. So we're
[33:57] going to uh inter you know weave that in
[34:00] and um some things that I want to say
[34:02] will actually give me a perfect segue to
[34:05] uh the burden of the word because I do
[34:07] have a burden of the word on my heart
[34:08] today. And I want to take u this thought
[34:11] looking to the divine in 2026.
[34:15] looking to the divine. And I'm not here,
[34:18] I promise you, this isn't um um I'm not
[34:23] here, this isn't a YouTube podcast on
[34:25] current events. This is not a news show.
[34:28] I'm going to preach the gospel. I'm a
[34:30] gospel preacher. It's what I do. But uh
[34:33] we do want to talk about some world
[34:35] events as they relate to prophecy.
[34:36] Brother Brandon would do that from time
[34:38] to time and kind of catch us up on world
[34:41] events at that era, in that era. And we
[34:43] can see that there were things that he
[34:46] said were coming that didn't materialize
[34:49] so much in his day as they have in our
[34:51] day. So it's relevant. Amen. To us. Are
[34:54] your hearts and minds open today to hear
[34:57] from the Lord. Amen. Philippians chapter
[35:00] 2
[35:02] and we're going to catch verses 12 to
[35:04] 18.
[35:10] If there be if there be therefore any
[35:13] consolation in Christ, if any comfort of
[35:16] love, if any fellowship of the spirit,
[35:20] I'm sorry, I'm starting. I'm in the
[35:21] wrong place. Ch verse 12. My apologies.
[35:24] I knew that didn't sound right. And you
[35:26] just pray for me today. Yesterday, I
[35:28] battled a curious headache all day. I
[35:30] couldn't get it to go away, and that's
[35:32] unusual for me. And then, um, went to
[35:35] sleep last night. I was telling Brother
[35:36] Jack, I slept 12 hours, which is like
[35:38] double my sleep time. And I woke up this
[35:41] morning with lying flu symptoms. And so,
[35:43] but the devil is still a liar.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; And uh I don't mind calling him liar to
[35:49] his face. [laughter] Amen. He still
[35:52] ain't nobody. And we're going to
[35:54] persevere and press on anyway. So if my
[35:56] voice sounds a little weaker than
[35:57] normal, you just keep praying for me.
[36:00] Amen. [clears throat] Verse 12.
[36:02] Philippians 2 verse 12. Wherefore, my
[36:06] beloved, as ye have always obeyed,
[36:10] [snorts] not [clears throat] as in my
[36:11] presence only, but now much more in my
[36:13] absence, work out your own salvation
[36:17] with fear and trembling.
[36:19] [clears throat]
[36:21] For it is God which workketh in you both
[36:24] to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[36:27] It's interesting he would daisy chain
[36:29] those two principles together,
[36:32] connecting them back to back. work out
[36:34] your own salvation, but it's God doing
[36:36] it.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; All right.
[36:40] Do all things. So your So your main
[36:42] working is to let is to be able for God
[36:44] to do it.
[36:47] Do all things without murmurings and
[36:49] disputings,
[36:51] [clears throat and snorts] that you may
[36:52] be blameless and harmless, the sons of
[36:55] God without rebuke, in the midst of a
[36:58] crooked and perverse nation, among whom
[37:01] you shine as lights in the world,
[37:05] holding forth the word of life, that I
[37:08] may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I
[37:11] have not run in vain, neither labored in
[37:14] vain. Yay. And if I be offered upon the
[37:18] sacrifice and service of your faith, I
[37:21] joy and rejoice with you all. For the
[37:24] same cause also do ye joy and rejoice
[37:28] with me. Let's pray.
[37:30] [snorts and clears throat]
[37:32] Father, I thank you for your wonderful
[37:35] word that I feel such an anointing for
[37:38] this morning. And and Lord, it's come to
[37:41] me in such a curious way. not so much in
[37:44] the normal way. I I've even found as
[37:47] I've studied it out and it it it just
[37:50] seemed like you wanted me to sit more
[37:52] quietly just in your presence and just
[37:54] reflect from my heart. So that's exactly
[37:57] what we're going to do today. I ask you
[38:00] to remember me embody the devil
[38:01] attacking and other families who are
[38:03] sick today with a number of requests
[38:05] that came in and some families traveling
[38:08] and uh on the road. I pray for their
[38:10] safety. Lord, all of your saints from
[38:13] Texas to Virginia and beyond and up into
[38:17] even Lord, Father, Midwestern states are
[38:20] under terrible conditions of storm. And
[38:23] we pray that you'll be a covert from
[38:25] storm for them all. [clears throat]
[38:28] Help us today. May you be with our
[38:31] technology that it doesn't fail, Lord,
[38:33] and keep us going now. We pray. We
[38:36] commit it all to you in Jesus name.
[38:38] Amen. God bless you, friends. You can be
[38:40] seated
[38:54] [clears throat]
[38:55] looking into 2026,
[39:00] you know, just just from the natural
[39:02] standpoint. And if you'll bear with me
[39:04] for just a few minutes, I want to use
[39:07] some of the natural part of things that
[39:09] the church that we're involved with and
[39:12] things that are happening, things also
[39:14] projects that I'm working on personally
[39:16] in my personal ministry.
[39:18] Aside from um my duties here at the
[39:22] church,
[39:23] [clears throat] you know, we um we still
[39:26] have our building project that is
[39:28] underway
[39:29] and and I and I you know, I can say a
[39:34] couple of things to that that it has
[39:36] gone longer than we wanted it to. Uh but
[39:41] it has not gone longer. It has not
[39:43] surprised us as brethren and trustees
[39:46] and and things of how long it's gone.
[39:48] These projects are are large and we
[39:51] we're trying by all possible means to do
[39:54] it without debt. And um [clears throat]
[39:57] so we have more to say on that. not
[40:00] going to take it all today and and pitch
[40:03] um you know our building program, but uh
[40:06] we've had a lot of stuff going on myself
[40:09] personally with moving and renovating
[40:12] the house next door that has caused some
[40:14] delays. Brother Matt was building for a
[40:17] number of years and he's kind of the
[40:19] head of that project and that and so I
[40:22] just want to say all of that to say that
[40:24] we are still very it's very much on our
[40:26] front burner now and we're looking I
[40:29] don't plan any new personal um major
[40:33] projects uh until we see this
[40:35] [clears throat] project completed. We
[40:37] need it. We want it. We have growing
[40:40] assembly, growing families, and we need
[40:43] the facilities upgraded, and we're
[40:45] trying by all possible means to save our
[40:48] money and do it uh with cash so that we
[40:52] don't have to borrow any money. And so,
[40:55] that's kind of where it's at. I just
[40:56] want to let you know that it's still
[40:59] underway and it's going forward. We
[41:02] first of all, you know, you're aware
[41:04] that we spent the first two years just
[41:06] trying to get it permitted and that was
[41:09] through the city. So much red tape to
[41:12] almost an embarrassing level and uh I
[41:15] was even entertaining the thoughts of
[41:17] reaching out to uh um a legal firm and
[41:20] attorneys and just say, "Hey, can you
[41:22] step in because it's becoming ridiculous
[41:25] and obviously things are happening on
[41:28] purpose and we know it's the devil
[41:29] fighting. We didn't have to do that. You
[41:32] know, I I I talked to one pastor of a
[41:35] [clears throat] large church in Texas
[41:36] and and they they actually when they get
[41:39] ready to do any kind of a building
[41:41] project, they actually submit their
[41:43] their permits to the city through an
[41:47] attorney's office. They actually have
[41:49] the attorney submit all the
[41:50] applications. And maybe that's a way to
[41:53] do it going forward if we ever run into
[41:55] that again. [clears throat] so that uh
[41:57] the powers that be understand that we're
[42:00] serious and uh we're going to have to be
[42:02] expect to be treated fairly. So that
[42:05] being said, we have all the permits that
[42:07] we need. I didn't even know that. I
[42:09] thought we only had the next stage. My
[42:11] understanding is now we have all the
[42:13] permits we will ever need to go all the
[42:15] way through to finish our to to start to
[42:19] erect our fellowship hall and connect it
[42:22] here and then renovate the sanctuary
[42:24] inside here. It'll give us more seating.
[42:27] It'll give us actually for the first
[42:28] time ever a vestibule area because when
[42:31] you step in from outside you're
[42:32] immediately in the in the sanctuary. So
[42:35] it'll give restrooms at the back. You
[42:36] won't have to walk around all the way
[42:38] around uh the church. So, don't don't
[42:41] make sure that we don't triple our trips
[42:44] to the restroom just because they're
[42:45] more convenient. Amen. But, uh, we're
[42:48] looking at doing that and and you just
[42:50] keep us in prayer. And if you have, you
[42:53] [clears throat] know, thought that you'd
[42:54] like to give and you've wondered, hey,
[42:56] what's even going on and don't just want
[42:57] to give to a Phantom Project, [snorts]
[43:00] it's real. And, uh, your contributions
[43:03] are all put in continually into that
[43:05] fund [clears throat] and we have a long
[43:08] ways to go. And so, but I think that we
[43:11] can um create a a sense and and I have
[43:14] some plans with the brothers to to
[43:17] present to you a really fresh updated
[43:19] version of of dollars and cents and
[43:22] where we are and building costs only go
[43:24] up. It gets more expensive every year.
[43:26] So, that's where we are in 2026 on our
[43:29] building project. We'd like to
[43:32] [clears throat] um make you aware that
[43:34] we have uh had the first meetings and
[43:38] and the wheels are already turning.
[43:40] We're not waiting to get them going.
[43:42] We've talked it through. We've mapped
[43:44] out a pro a program and we actually have
[43:47] wheels turning for Bethl Tabernacle
[43:50] School of the Future. and we call it the
[43:53] future not because we're doing it in the
[43:55] future, but because we're going to make
[43:57] it first class uh school learning
[44:00] environment. We already have students.
[44:02] We already have volunteers. We already
[44:04] are assembling our curriculum and that's
[44:07] going to involve a lot of technology and
[44:10] uh you can't avoid that. You know, we'd
[44:12] love to just go back to the one room
[44:14] schoolhouse with the Bible as our
[44:16] primmer. And believe me, the Bible will
[44:18] be our primmer. But uh but we're going
[44:20] to leverage technology in a safe
[44:23] environment and it's going to have
[44:25] ministry oversight from day one. So I
[44:28] want you to know that and I just I'm I'm
[44:31] of the opinion that u children should
[44:34] not go to public schools uh in grade
[44:37] school, middle school, or even high
[44:40] school. That's brother Jason's personal
[44:42] opinion. I know that some have, some do,
[44:44] some will, and they do it successfully.
[44:47] But I believe that we can give a better
[44:50] alternative with a a schooling and uh
[44:54] with the with the agentive future that's
[44:57] rushing in right now. Trust me,
[44:59] brickandmortar learning institutions,
[45:01] their days are numbered. Certainly, if
[45:03] they don't have a major overhaul, uh
[45:06] they're going to become they are already
[45:08] becoming irrelevant rapidly. Um, I could
[45:11] spend my entire sermon just updating you
[45:14] on where we are in technology and
[45:17] markets and business and things like
[45:19] that. And businesses are already
[45:21] scrambling. 2026 is going to be the
[45:24] year. Not going to be, it already is
[45:25] happening. So, it's not something we're
[45:27] predicting. It's already happening. Um,
[45:30] the business models are changing. um the
[45:33] the the the the technology is such and
[45:37] they're moving towards super
[45:38] intelligence that uh it's going to be
[45:41] the most and I say this without any
[45:43] hesitation. It will be the most
[45:45] transformative thing to happen to the
[45:48] world. It'll it'll exceed the internet,
[45:51] the computer, the automobile, the jet
[45:54] plane, space travel. It will exceed all
[45:57] of that. It will be the largest
[45:59] transformation of politics, education,
[46:03] business, government, lifestyle and it
[46:06] is rolling in very rapidly. Friends,
[46:09] mankind is inventing himself into his
[46:13] own destruction and it is coming and uh
[46:16] the types and shadows in the scripture
[46:18] are so clear. It's it's ringing the
[46:20] bells of prophecy as it goes along. And
[46:24] you know, everything from the tree of
[46:26] knowledge, we know brings more death.
[46:29] And so, you know, businesses are are
[46:33] right now trying to play catch-up. And
[46:35] the businesses who aren't are going to
[46:36] find themselves irrelevant very quickly.
[46:39] and [snorts] governments and you know I
[46:41] could just I could just um take you to
[46:44] some of the most learned people that I
[46:47] that I follow um so that I stay on the
[46:50] on the absolute edge because it's for me
[46:53] it's not about being on the edge of
[46:55] technology. It's about being able to
[46:57] track modern events made clear in
[46:59] prophecy. That's why brother Jason does
[47:01] it. That's that's really my 90%. I have
[47:04] a personal appeal to technology. I'm a
[47:07] little bit of a nerd that way. But for
[47:09] me, it's all about prophecy and where
[47:12] are we and the things that I see
[47:14] happening. I can tell you friends, look
[47:16] up. Your redemption draweth nigh.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; The world is racing and judgments are
[47:21] racing to meet the world. And as you've
[47:23] heard me say many times, the only way
[47:26] out is up. Amen. And so, if there was
[47:29] ever a time for you to be to make your
[47:32] calling and election sure, it's now. If
[47:35] there was ever a time to work out your
[47:37] salvation with fear and trembling, it's
[47:39] now. So, we are we are looking to to
[47:44] kind of uh take that and provide a
[47:47] learning environment uh for our
[47:49] children. And um I don't condemn any
[47:52] parents who still put their children in
[47:54] public schools. And I'm not brother
[47:57] Brandham was not opposed to education.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; He was absolutely not opposed to
[48:02] education. What what bothered brother
[48:05] Brham is that the as long as you
[48:07] understand the more you eat of education
[48:11] that education, civilization, politics,
[48:15] everything is of the devil.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; That's that's right from a prophet. It
[48:21] leading the world to Armageddon and a
[48:24] self-destruction.
[48:25] And in fact is God's not going to have
[48:28] to destroy mankind. He's just going to
[48:30] stop stopping him from destroying
[48:32] himself. And the only reason that that's
[48:35] being stopped right now is you are here.
[48:38] And once the bride goes up, Satan is
[48:40] cast down. Woe unto the inhabitants of
[48:42] the earth for Satan has come down to
[48:44] you. I'm here to tell you something,
[48:46] friends. That's not a time you want to
[48:47] be here. This is a serious hour. And
[48:50] we're preaching that we uh that we have
[48:52] ourselves ready as I've been preaching
[48:55] that just like Enoch the rapture. And I
[48:57] proved it to you. We strung a bunch of
[48:59] quotes together in services some uh some
[49:02] some services ago that the rapture will
[49:05] be so simple it will be just the next
[49:07] short step. Uh it'll be a short step
[49:10] further than you were the day before and
[49:13] you'll just step in and your the dead
[49:15] love dead loved ones will come back
[49:17] because they're not actually dead.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; They've never actually died. You know,
[49:23] one of the conversation starter I love
[49:26] and I'll provoke it in a group of people
[49:28] is when somebody says the end of the
[49:30] world and I say to the world's not
[49:31] ending
[49:32] &gt;&gt; and all eyes you got everybody's
[49:34] attention right fast. The world's not
[49:35] ending. The earth's eternal attribute of
[49:37] God can never be annihilated. What's
[49:39] ending is the civilization, mankind's
[49:42] 6,000year run in a fallen condition.
[49:44] That's ending. And a new king is taking
[49:46] over the earth. We're going to be right
[49:48] here. It's going to carry right on. See?
[49:51] and and you know so so and then the next
[49:54] thing when they talk about this person
[49:56] died or that famous person and I'll
[49:58] sometimes I'll pitch in no one's ever
[50:00] actually died yet.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; No one only the second death the lake of
[50:06] fire is actual full death. All people
[50:09] have done since the Garden of Eden is
[50:12] transition from this dimension into
[50:13] another one. They're still very much
[50:15] alive. See? So, so, so when you when you
[50:20] die, that's why when people try to take
[50:22] their own life because they want to get
[50:23] out of a miserable situation. I'm sorry,
[50:26] but all you do is transfer your own self
[50:28] from the frying pan to the fire because
[50:30] there's you dying doesn't fix anything.
[50:33] You're still alive. Your body lays down.
[50:35] The spirit exits, but everyone who's
[50:38] ever lived is still alive
[50:40] &gt;&gt; and somewhere.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't ever lose sight of that.
[50:44] See, and so we know that on that morning
[50:47] the dead in Christ shall rise and we
[50:49] which are alive and remain. Brother
[50:51] Brandham said you'll you'll feel a
[50:53] little feeling come across you. You'll
[50:55] turn around and there'll be mother or
[50:57] father or that loved one that grow
[50:59] that's gone on and there they'll be and
[51:01] then that'll be a catalyst to your faith
[51:03] to change your mortal bodies.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I don't feel like the
[51:08] flu this morning. My goodness. Amen.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[51:13] &gt;&gt; So, so there there's some of the things
[51:16] that we're doing. We're also um
[51:19] restarting um not restarting it as if we
[51:22] canceled it, but we brother Kevin and
[51:25] Sister Sarah, they did the financial
[51:27] peace university classes. We're going to
[51:29] be starting that back up again. You
[51:31] should see brother Kevin uh and sister
[51:33] Sarah to get on the schedule. That was
[51:35] magnificently successful. and young
[51:38] couples at that time really and even
[51:41] even older couples and I audited those
[51:43] classes most of them set in on them
[51:46] myself and they're very good and uh
[51:49] we're going to be starting that up again
[51:50] very soon do you have a starting date
[51:52] brother Kev for that yet
[51:54] &gt;&gt; okay but it's soon
[51:56] &gt;&gt; very good very soon and so you be
[51:59] getting if you want to um it's it's it's
[52:01] it's biblical principles u that brother
[52:04] Kevin and sister Sarah have studied and
[52:06] learned and are and actually are
[52:08] qualified, certified to teach those
[52:10] things. And um there's there's few
[52:12] things worse than being chained to
[52:14] Pharaoh's chariot of debt. There's few
[52:17] things worse than being chained to that.
[52:19] And so one of the best things that you
[52:21] can do is to, you know, see yourself
[52:25] successful financially. Nothing wrong
[52:28] with that either. But you want to that
[52:30] God has a provided way. God has a
[52:33] provided way for everything. Amen.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; So we Why would you not go God's way?
[52:38] It's provided. Amen. So we're going to
[52:41] be starting that very soon. Uh we also
[52:44] have as another Bethl tabernacle project
[52:47] is some we have some new mission work
[52:49] opportunities that are ramping up right
[52:51] now and beginning to scale in India. And
[52:54] [clears throat] from there we have plans
[52:55] for India and Pakistan. They used to be
[52:57] actually one country and they divided
[52:59] away from Hindus and Muslims back in the
[53:01] days of Gandhi. And so, um, we're
[53:04] working now to put translated books into
[53:07] the hands there in India. Working there
[53:09] with, um, um, brother, um, um, my good
[53:13] friend, never forget him. [laughter]
[53:15] Um, I'm drawing a blank right now. It'll
[53:18] come to me in a minute, but we're
[53:19] working with brother Barry Coffee with
[53:22] those brothers. I hope he doesn't hear
[53:24] that because he's going to say, "How
[53:26] could you not remember my name?" I do
[53:27] remember his name. It's just old-timers.
[53:29] But anyway, amen. So that's starting to
[53:32] scale and we're we're also still
[53:34] involved with Vision Books, putting
[53:37] books into Africa across the continent.
[53:40] We've been working with Brother Barry
[53:41] Coffee on that for a number of years. So
[53:44] this is a new project uh that we're
[53:46] ramping up uh there. Amen. I'm going to
[53:49] get that name as sure as anything. But
[53:51] anyway, Brother Samson Shetty, praise
[53:53] the Lord. Thank you, brother Samson, my
[53:55] very good friend. Amen. and he is
[53:58] heading up a team of brothers there to
[54:00] do that. Um I I coveret your prayers on
[54:03] some personal projects I'm working on. I
[54:06] am um I'm I'm working and I've already
[54:10] completed part of it on um a verse
[54:13] byvere commentary on the entire book of
[54:15] Revelation. I started that some years
[54:17] ago with live um uh teaching online live
[54:21] Bible studies. We went a little over
[54:23] three and a half years and we went verse
[54:25] by verse. We called it the work of a
[54:26] thousand days. That's all on audio
[54:28] files. I'm working on trying to
[54:30] transcribe that into a study guide book
[54:34] um on the entire book of Revelation
[54:36] verse by verse. I've picked up again uh
[54:40] on my my work from some years ago on a
[54:43] translation and commentary on the book
[54:45] of Romans. Uh I've started actually
[54:48] writing a new book personally called if
[54:51] I could talk to Jesus face to face and I
[54:55] was the whole idea of that came to me
[54:58] because I realized that Jesus preached
[55:00] to thousands. He sat in a boat and
[55:03] preached to everybody on the shore. He
[55:04] moved among they thronged him and and
[55:07] there were times but there were times in
[55:09] the Bible where it was just Jesus and a
[55:11] person. He was just speaking to them.
[55:14] They were talking to him. I think of
[55:16] Nicodemus who met him in the middle of
[55:17] the night. See, and I I I think of these
[55:21] these times where individuals met him
[55:24] when the centurion came to him. My my
[55:26] servant is sick. And these kinds of
[55:28] one-on-one conversations. To my shock
[55:31] when I began to look at it, there's more
[55:34] than more than 30 almost 40 different
[55:36] times where Jesus is actually speaking
[55:39] to an individual face to face. And so
[55:42] the whole premise of the book is to take
[55:45] those instances and give the world an
[55:48] idea of how the actual Jesus handled
[55:51] life situations. And I'm here to tell
[55:54] you something, friends, by by studying
[55:57] his interaction personally, not his
[55:59] sermon on the mount. That's not what I'm
[56:01] talking about. I'm not talking about
[56:02] when he's feeding 5,000. I'm talking
[56:04] about when he's face to face. If I could
[56:07] talk to Jesus face to face and tell him
[56:10] my problem, what do I expect his answer?
[56:14] How would he talk to me? In what way?
[56:17] What tone? What approach would he take?
[56:19] And so that's something that I've been
[56:21] working on. I've also felt inspired to
[56:24] begin a work on the entire book of
[56:26] Psalms from the perspective of William
[56:29] Brham. Brother Brham used a lot of the
[56:31] Psalms. So, you know, they say as long
[56:33] as somebody owes you money, you'll never
[56:35] be broke. So, I figure as long as I've
[56:38] got a project to work on, I'll never be
[56:40] bored. Amen. I'll never have nothing to
[56:43] do. So, you pray for me. [clears throat]
[56:46] I'll I'll I'll kind of keep you up to
[56:48] date as those projects go along. Amen.
[56:51] I'm enjoying the work. I love I love I
[56:54] heard brother Tim Puit make a statement
[56:56] some years ago. I had such an affinity
[56:59] with it. He said he made this statement.
[57:01] And he said, "I do not study to preach."
[57:05] He said, "I study because I love it."
[57:09] And that I just said, "Man, how well
[57:11] said is that?" And uh I don't truly
[57:14] don't study to preach. I feel like I'm
[57:15] preaching all the time, either in a
[57:16] pullpit or online or personto person.
[57:19] But uh I study the God's word because I
[57:22] love it. It's like I can't get enough of
[57:24] it. And so um so you be praying for me
[57:27] in those projects. Amen. That's what
[57:30] we're looking forward to going in this
[57:32] year. Now, I want to say a few more
[57:34] things about modern events made clear in
[57:37] prophecy. But I want to first take you
[57:39] back to our to our opening text from
[57:43] Philippians. And I'm going to read it to
[57:45] you. Brother Kevin, if you have uh the
[57:47] NIV translation, you can pick up
[57:51] Philippians 2:12.
[57:53] And I'm I want to read just a couple of
[57:55] these verses again. And I want to begin
[57:57] to make some points. Paul says here in
[58:00] Philippians 2:12 uh from the New
[58:03] International Version, "Therefore, my
[58:06] and the NIV is not a version I use a lot
[58:08] of. I'm I really don't favor it most
[58:10] often, but it I favored a particular way
[58:14] that it it worded something here." So,
[58:16] I'm um and I first had to study to make
[58:18] sure it was accurate, and it certainly
[58:20] is. And so he says here in verse 12,
[58:24] "Therefore, my dear friends, as you have
[58:26] always obeyed, not only in my absence,
[58:30] but now much more in my absence.
[58:33] Continue to work out your salvation with
[58:37] fear and trembling. For it is God who
[58:40] works in you to will and to act in order
[58:43] to fulfill his good purpose." Not yours,
[58:47] his. do everything without grumbling and
[58:50] arguing. Most commentators think that
[58:52] Paul being a Jew was all too familiar
[58:56] with the the common thing that seemed to
[59:00] be among Israelites and that is to
[59:01] grumble and complain. You remember when
[59:03] Moses brought them out in the wilderness
[59:06] and they all they grumbled and
[59:07] complained. They were always grumbling,
[59:09] always complaining. Don't never do that,
[59:11] friends. Brother Brandham said, "Don't
[59:13] never let a negative word come out of
[59:15] your mouth." See, we've been talking a
[59:17] lot about what things are pure and
[59:19] lovely and of a good report. We should
[59:21] be thinking on these things. So, he
[59:24] says, "Do everything, you know, and this
[59:26] is a burden on Paul's heart." And I I
[59:28] felt when I read Philippians 2, the Lord
[59:31] seemed to lead me in that direction. I
[59:33] thought to myself, you know, here Paul
[59:36] has been moving among them. He was there
[59:39] and preaching and they knew him and he
[59:41] knew many of them in the flesh. And now
[59:43] he's been taken away for by
[59:45] circumstances beyond his control. There
[59:47] were times when Paul would write to
[59:49] churches and say, "I purposed to come
[59:52] see you, but Satan hindered me." It's
[59:54] hard to say why God would allow Satan to
[59:56] hinder that. But what for whatever
[59:59] reason, it didn't stop God's program.
[1:00:02] And and and I'm here to tell you
[1:00:03] something, friends. A lot of times we,
[1:00:06] you know, we we find ourselves thinking
[1:00:10] that, you know, I I I I've been such a
[1:00:12] failure at this and such a failure at
[1:00:14] that. You know, when God told David that
[1:00:18] there would never fail to be a man on
[1:00:20] the throne from David's lineage and that
[1:00:22] he would establish the throne of David
[1:00:25] forever and that even when Messiah come,
[1:00:27] he would be known as the son of David in
[1:00:30] the millennium. And you know, David had
[1:00:32] some rather titanic failures after that.
[1:00:35] But you know, not one of his failures
[1:00:37] stopped that prophecy.
[1:00:40] Not one God kept putting a man on the
[1:00:43] throne. God w God God Christ came as the
[1:00:46] son of David. He will rule and reign in
[1:00:49] the millennium. And I know that we have
[1:00:51] our ups and downs. Let's just own it
[1:00:53] today. just to say, you know, UM I DON'T
[1:00:55] ALWAYS, YOU KNOW, sometimes I I don't
[1:00:58] always keep all my commitments and
[1:01:00] promises to the Lord. David didn't
[1:01:02] either. That's why David said, "I, you
[1:01:04] know, I I I thought on my ways and I
[1:01:08] turned my feet toward the Lord." Brother
[1:01:10] Brandham said that meant that what was
[1:01:12] happening with David is David was
[1:01:14] remembering all the times all the
[1:01:16] promises he had made God. And he
[1:01:19] realized as a human he hadn't always
[1:01:21] kept them exactly like he promised the
[1:01:24] Lord he would. And he SAYS AS I THOUGHT
[1:01:26] on my ways. See, and I think it's good
[1:01:29] for us to think on our ways and realize
[1:01:32] that I I HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN WHAT I NEED
[1:01:34] TO BE, BUT GOD IS STILL GOD AND THE WORD
[1:01:37] IS STILL TRUE AND I'M STILL A BELIEVER
[1:01:40] AND I'M STILL HEADED FOR A RAPTURE. I I
[1:01:43] I I'M I'M PREDESTINATED not to fall.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; I BECAUSE OF MY ELECTION, I CANNOT I
[1:01:49] CANNOT BE DECEIVED by the lie that is
[1:01:53] being told to THE WORLD. THAT'S OF NO
[1:01:55] merit on my own. Right?
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; If I didn't GET IT BY MERIT, HOW WOULD I
[1:02:00] LOSE IT BY FAILURE?
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO IT'S GOD WHO RULES AND REIGNS,
[1:02:05] FRIENDS. And I'm HERE TO TELL YOU
[1:02:06] SOMETHING TODAY. SOMETIMES YOU CAN FEEL
[1:02:08] ALMOST wearied by your own uh LACK OF
[1:02:12] SPIRITUALITY. YOU KNOW, I I'M HERE TO
[1:02:14] TELL YOU, AS I'VE SHOWN YOU MANY TIMES
[1:02:15] BEFORE, they know this in the military,
[1:02:18] that when you WHEN YOU GET OUT OF A
[1:02:20] STEP, THE WHOLE REASON THEY HAVE THAT
[1:02:22] CADENCE, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT,
[1:02:25] and they sing and they and it's ALL TO A
[1:02:27] RHYTHM. ARMIES HAVE DONE THAT through
[1:02:29] millennia. SEE, [clears throat] BECAUSE
[1:02:32] NOT ONLY DOES IT DOES SINGING give
[1:02:34] courage, BUT IT ACTUALLY CAUSES THAT
[1:02:37] UNIT TO OPERATE. the the Roman legions
[1:02:39] would beat a drum and they those whole
[1:02:41] failanks was would TURN AND THEY KNEW
[1:02:44] AND they'd raise a flag and beat a drum
[1:02:45] and they knew exactly how to do it and
[1:02:47] AND AND SO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS
[1:02:50] THAT I remember that um brother Stacy
[1:02:53] told me there brother Stacy Goodre he's
[1:02:55] in the I think the Air Force and we were
[1:02:57] talking about you know the brother
[1:02:59] Brandham showing the bride he said the
[1:03:01] two or three of them at the end were
[1:03:03] getting out of step and he said I
[1:03:04] SCREAMED YOU KNOW GET BACK IN STEP GET
[1:03:07] STAY IN LINE STAY IN HE SAID, "WHEN I
[1:03:09] CAME OUT OF THE VISION, I WAS STANDING
[1:03:10] IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WITH MY HANDS
[1:03:11] OUT SAYING, "STAY IN LINE." SEE, AND
[1:03:14] BROTHER STACY SAID, "YEAH." HE SAID, YOU
[1:03:16] KNOW, HE SAID, "THEY were marching."
[1:03:17] Because brother M said they were
[1:03:18] marching to the step of the gospel and
[1:03:22] two or three at the END AT THE LAST THE
[1:03:25] LAST DAYS. SOMETIMES WE FIND OURSELVES A
[1:03:28] LITTLE BIT OUT OF STEP.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; BUT BROTHER STACY SAID, "BUT THE THING
[1:03:31] TO REMEMBER, UH, he says, IS IT ONLY
[1:03:34] TAKES A HALF STEP TO FIX IT." AMEN.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; IT ONLY TAKES A HALF STEP. AND I I'VE
[1:03:39] DEMONSTRATED IT BEFORE. THE WAY BROTHER
[1:03:40] STACY DEMONSTRATED, it's left, LEFT, AND
[1:03:44] IF YOU'RE AT A STEP, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
[1:03:46] IS LEFT and just TAKE A HALF A STEP.
[1:03:49] YOU'RE ONLY A HALF A STEP OUT. I DON'T
[1:03:51] CARE WHAT THE DEVIL HAS DONE. YOU'RE
[1:03:52] ONLY A HALF STEP OUT. JUST MAKE A HALF
[1:03:54] STEP AND YOU'LL BE BACK IN HARMONY.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM HAS A HAS A WOMAN COME
[1:04:00] UP IN THE LINE AND HE SAYS, "NOW, YOU'VE
[1:04:02] BEEN AWAY FROM GOD." YES. BUT YOU WANT
[1:04:05] TO COME BACK. YES, YOU'RE BACK.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. HIS MERCIES ARE NEW
[1:04:11] EVERY MORNING.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; DON'T GET DISCOURAGED. WE'RE CLOSE TO
[1:04:15] HOME, FRIENDS. PRESS TOWARDS the mark.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Be willing to press.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; That means strain, STRETCH, REACH.
[1:04:25] SOMETIMES YOU'LL CATCH A CHARLIE HORSE
[1:04:26] DOING THAT. AND AND SOMETIMES A
[1:04:29] SPIRITUAL CHARLIE HORSE IS WHAT YOU
[1:04:30] NEED.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; YEAH. YOU MAY SAY IT'S PAINFUL. YEAH.
[1:04:34] AND AND AND YOU YOU DO A INDIAN WAR
[1:04:36] DANCE. YEAH, GO FOR IT. BECAUSE IT'LL
[1:04:38] PUT YOU BACK IN STEPS. SAY I I DON'T I
[1:04:41] NEED TO GET IN BETTER SHAPE SO THAT WHEN
[1:04:42] I'M STRETCHING I DON'T CHARLIE HORSE
[1:04:45] LIKE THAT.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; SO THIS ISN'T A TIME TO BE afraid
[1:04:52] because the world is ending or the world
[1:04:55] is transitioning. This is a time that
[1:04:57] Jesus said Jesus named a whole string of
[1:05:01] of really um frightening
[1:05:06] uh words and prophecies. You know,
[1:05:08] YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THIS, YOU'RE GOING
[1:05:09] TO SEE THAT. THERE'S GOING TO BE WARS
[1:05:11] AND EARTHQUAKES AND THERE'S GOING TO BE
[1:05:13] FAMINES AND ALL THESE THINGS AND BUT
[1:05:15] CARRY ON THE TIMES NOT YET. BUT THEN
[1:05:16] YOU'LL FINALLY GET TO A TIME WHERE
[1:05:18] YOU'LL SEE THIS AND you'll see that and
[1:05:19] there will be many false Christ. AND I
[1:05:21] MEAN, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A message of
[1:05:23] doom. you know, JESUS WAS ANYTHING. BUT
[1:05:27] BUT BUT YOU KNOW, SOME OF THESE
[1:05:28] PROSPERITY PREACHERS, SOME OF THESE
[1:05:30] SMILEY PREACHERS WHO JUST TELL EVERYBODY
[1:05:32] THAT, "OH, GOD LOVES YOU. IT DOESN'T
[1:05:34] EVEN MATTER." OH, IT MATTERS. IT MATTERS
[1:05:36] HOW YOU LIVE. IT MATTERS HOW WE THINK.
[1:05:39] SEE? And so, WE'VE BEEN PROVING THAT IN
[1:05:41] OUR IN OUR PREVIOUS SERIES. And so,
[1:05:44] Jesus would say, "When you see these
[1:05:46] things, LOOK UP. YOUR REDEMPTION draweth
[1:05:50] nigh."
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; So, this isn't a time to be discouraged.
[1:05:53] is certainly not a time to BE GETTING
[1:05:55] OUT OF STEP. IT'S NOT A BECAUSE THE
[1:05:57] BRIDE IS ALREADY ASCENDING. I'M HERE TO
[1:05:59] TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. The rapture
[1:06:01] is not a future coming event. THE
[1:06:04] RAPTURE IS NOW. YOU'RE IT. YOU'RE IN IT.
[1:06:06] It's happening.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; It's happening in real time. AS YOU LIVE
[1:06:11] AND BREATHE RIGHT NOW, THE BRIDE IS
[1:06:13] GETTING CLOSER and closer to that
[1:06:16] momentous morning.
[1:06:20] SO I I LOVED THIS TEXT BECAUSE VERSE 15
[1:06:25] 14 and 15 DO EVERYTHING WITHOUT
[1:06:27] GRUMBLING and or arguing so that you may
[1:06:30] become blameless and pure children of
[1:06:33] God without fault in a warped and
[1:06:35] crooked generation. Now we've shown you
[1:06:38] the reason I'm zeroing in on that is
[1:06:40] because as we've shown you before Paul
[1:06:42] IS CLEARLY TALKING TO PEOPLE who are
[1:06:45] already children OF GOD. SO HE'S NOT
[1:06:48] SAYING IF YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH you can
[1:06:49] become a CHILD OF GOD. HE'S TALKING
[1:06:52] ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY CHILDREN of
[1:06:54] God who are already born again of the
[1:06:55] spirit. And he's HE'S BASICALLY HIS THIS
[1:06:58] IS HIS SAME MESSAGE PRESS TOWARDS THE
[1:07:00] MARK. YOU NEED TO BECOME BLAMELESS and
[1:07:02] pure because you LIVE IN A WARPED AND
[1:07:06] CROOKED GENERATION AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED
[1:07:08] TO BE A LIGHTBEARER. SO HE'S JUST SIMPLY
[1:07:11] SAYING YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOUR LIGHT
[1:07:14] IS SHINING BRIGHT SONS AND DAUGHTERS of
[1:07:16] God.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:07:19] SO IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE EARNED OUR WAY
[1:07:21] INTO SUNSHIP. You can't really do that.
[1:07:24] YOU CAN'T GAIN ETERNAL LIFE THROUGH
[1:07:25] WORKS like that. But it's it's it's but
[1:07:28] it but it's what WE HAVE BEEN PREACHING
[1:07:30] IN OUR IN our previous series that that
[1:07:34] the that even AFTER THE NEW BIRTH, YOU
[1:07:36] KNOW, IT'S NOT YOU'RE BORN AGAIN, SEE
[1:07:38] YOU IN A RAPTURE. IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW.
[1:07:41] NOW YOU'RE NOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE
[1:07:44] CAPACITY TO CAST DOWN EVERY VAIN
[1:07:46] IMAGINATION.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE HUMAN MIND, THE FALLEN mind
[1:07:51] of man is enmity against God and can
[1:07:53] never agree with God. See, that's the
[1:07:55] scriptures. And so, THE FIRST THING GOD
[1:07:58] HAS TO DO IS BEGIN TO MOVE ON YOUR LIFE
[1:08:00] AND START TO DEAL WITH YOU. BROTHER
[1:08:02] BRANDHAM SAYS IT LIKE THIS. HE SAYS IN
[1:08:05] PLANTING THE vine and where to plant it.
[1:08:08] I'm watching my time carefully.
[1:08:11] [clears throat]
[1:08:12] Brother Brandham says, "Now, Israel
[1:08:16] in Egypt was not planted.
[1:08:21] They were JUST SET OUT. IT wasn't their
[1:08:24] original home ground.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; You understand? So they ended up there
[1:08:28] through consequences that stretched over
[1:08:30] hundreds of years. BUT BUT HE SAYS, "BUT
[1:08:33] THEY WERE NOT PLANTED THERE." THAT'S NOT
[1:08:35] WHERE GOD PLANTED his vine. They had
[1:08:37] been planted uh in in the promised land.
[1:08:42] AND SO MOSES IS AND THAT WAS GOD'S
[1:08:44] PROMISE THAT ABRAHAM WAS GIVEN THAT
[1:08:47] LAND. AND GOD TOLD MOSES, "YOU'RE GOING
[1:08:49] TO TAKE THEM BACK THERE. THIS ISN'T
[1:08:50] WHERE THEY BELONG." MY AND CATCH that
[1:08:53] friends because BECAUSE MANY OF THEM
[1:08:56] WERE BORN in Egypt. BUT IT WHAT THE THE
[1:09:00] THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT IT DOESN'T
[1:09:02] MATTER WHAT, HOW, WHEN, WHERE YOU WERE
[1:09:05] BORN. YOU HAD A PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN
[1:09:08] THE MIND OF GOD. AND GOD HAS A PLACE IN
[1:09:11] HIS WORD THAT YOU ARE PREDESTINATED TO
[1:09:13] ARRIVE AT. AND NO, NO EFFECT OF MY BIRTH
[1:09:16] OR MY RAISING OR THIS HAPPENING OR THAT
[1:09:18] HAPPENING. EVEN IF I WAS CULPABLE IN THE
[1:09:21] HAPPENING, NOTHING IS GOING TO STOP ME
[1:09:23] FROM THE PROMISED LAND.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; AND WHILE I'M GOING THERE, THERE'S A LOT
[1:09:28] OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR ME TO NOT GRUMBLE.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; I PROMISE YOU, LIFE WILL FLOOD YOU WITH
[1:09:36] OPPORTUNITIES to not complain.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; It's just an opportunity.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; It's up to you whether you do or not.
[1:09:45] See, it's up to you whether you press or
[1:09:47] not. Paul is suggesting that you need to
[1:09:50] do this so that you can become blameless
[1:09:53] in a in a perverse in a warped.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; It wasn't so much so only 4,000 years in
[1:10:00] Paul's day.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Paul wasn't dealing with the pale horse
[1:10:04] rider. We are.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Paul wasn't Paul wasn't dealing with
[1:10:08] Satan's Eden. We do.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Paul Satan wasn't the god of the age in
[1:10:13] his day. And they had a they HAD A LION
[1:10:16] TO TO ANOINTING. WE HAVE AN EAGLE
[1:10:18] ANOINTING. GOD HAS NOT LEFT US WITH THE
[1:10:20] SHORT END OF THE STICK. FRIENDS, I'M
[1:10:22] HERE TO TELL YOU, EVERY PROMISE IN THE
[1:10:24] BOOK IS YOURS IF YOU'LL CLAIM IT AND
[1:10:26] BELIEVE IT. AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
[1:10:27] DEVILS IN HELL THAT CAN STOP YOU.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Only you can stop you.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO I JUST SAY PRESS
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THIS IS A WARPED GENERATION AND
[1:10:37] WE NEED TO BE LIGHTS and we NEED TO HAVE
[1:10:39] THEM BRIGHT AND SHINING.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I DIDN'T START HERE,
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; NOT finishing here.
[1:10:47] IF 2026 FINISHES MY LIFE ON EARTH, I
[1:10:50] DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T
[1:10:52] HAVE A GUARANTEE OF TOMORROW. YOU DON'T
[1:10:53] HAVE A GUARANTEE YOU'LL SLEEP IN YOUR
[1:10:54] OWN BED TONIGHT.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; You see, AND THAT'S WHAT PAUL IS SAYING.
[1:10:58] YOU KNOW, I I WANT TO KNOW THAT THAT
[1:11:00] THAT NOW THAT I CAN'T BE AMONG YOU. I
[1:11:02] USED TO BE, NOW I CAN'T BE. I WANT TO
[1:11:03] KNOW ON THAT DAY I DIDN'T RUN IN VAIN. I
[1:11:06] EVERY PREACHER, EVERY PASTOR feels that
[1:11:08] way. I I CAN'T LISTEN FRIENDS. IF THE
[1:11:11] LORD WOULD TARRY U YOU KNOW ANOTHER EVEN
[1:11:14] ANOTHER 30 YEARS 40 50 YEARS WHICH I
[1:11:17] DON'T THINK AT ALL THERE'S ANY EVEN any
[1:11:19] any I TO ME I DON'T SEE HOW THAT COULD
[1:11:22] BE EVEN be possible AND AND IT'S NOT
[1:11:24] THAT GOD COULDN'T DO IT I JUST SIMPLY
[1:11:26] SAY I DON'T SEE HOW HUMANITY COULD
[1:11:28] SURVIVE ANOTHER 30 or 40 years
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; at the rate that IT'S SELF-DESTRUCTING
[1:11:34] AND BUT YOU KNOW IF IF THAT HAPPENS and
[1:11:37] and I PASS ON YOU KNOW I'M SORRY. I'M
[1:11:40] SORRY. I SAY TO SOME OF YOU YOUNGER
[1:11:42] ONES, I'm sorry that I can't be with you
[1:11:46] for your whole life
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; as a message BELIEVER AND SOMEDAY I'LL
[1:11:50] PASS ON. CAN BROTHER JASON KNOW THAT ON
[1:11:52] THAT DAY I WON'T HAVE RUN IN VAIN?
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; CAN EVERY PASTOR KNOW THAT HE DIDN'T RUN
[1:11:57] IN VAIN? HE DIDN'T LABOR IN VAIN. I'M
[1:11:59] TELLING YOU FRIENDS, WE'RE ALL IN THIS
[1:12:01] TOGETHER AND SOME OF OUR ALL HAVE GONE
[1:12:03] AHEAD OF US AND I MIGHT GO AHEAD OF YOU
[1:12:05] AND YOU'LL COME AHEAD OF ME. I DON'T
[1:12:07] KNOW. I JUST WANT TO BE THERE.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO BE THERE. I WANT YOUR
[1:12:12] FAMILIES TO BE THERE.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; SEE?
[1:12:16] SO,
[1:12:17] so we strive, we press, I want to BECOME
[1:12:21] I'M I'M ALREADY A CHILD SON OF GOD. I
[1:12:24] WANT TO BECOME BLAMELESS.
[1:12:26] Paul wouldn't suggest that if it wasn't
[1:12:28] possible.
[1:12:30] See, HE'S NOT SUGGESTING I I ACCOMPLISH
[1:12:33] SOMETHING THAT'S NOT EVEN DOABLE, so
[1:12:35] that you may become BLAMELESS AND PURE
[1:12:38] CHILDREN OF GOD WITHOUT FAULT in a
[1:12:40] warped and crooked generation. Then you
[1:12:43] will shine among them like stars in the
[1:12:46] sky as you hold firmly to the word of
[1:12:50] life. And then I will be able to boast
[1:12:53] on the day of Christ that I did not run
[1:12:56] or labor in vain. See,
[1:13:00] AND SO HE GOES ON, HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, uh
[1:13:03] that I that I did not uh labor in vain.
[1:13:08] Uh but even if I am being poured out
[1:13:11] like a drink offering on the sacrifice
[1:13:12] and service COMING FROM YOUR FAITH, I AM
[1:13:15] glad and rejoice with all OF YOU. CAN I
[1:13:19] say today, it's been worth it.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; I want you TO KNOW SOMETHING. I STARTED
[1:13:23] 30 years ago in a little frame in a
[1:13:26] little A-frame church with with barely
[1:13:28] 20 people and you couldn't the tall
[1:13:31] PEOPLE HAD TO STAND IN THE MIDDLE AND
[1:13:32] THE SHORTER PEOPLE HAD TO STAND AGAINST
[1:13:34] THE WALLS or you stood like this. WE
[1:13:36] WE'VE COME A LONG WAYS BETHL TABERNACLE
[1:13:38] AND I WOULDN'T CHANGE IT AND I DON'T
[1:13:40] REGRET IT AND I'M GLAD I DID IT.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND I I'M GLAD TO be
[1:13:44] numbered WITH THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE THE
[1:13:46] WORD OF GOD. I've never HAD THAT PROBLEM
[1:13:49] HERE. HAVE NEVER HAD A CONGREGATION THAT
[1:13:51] WEREN'T LOVERS OF THE WORD of God.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; My, we are truly all in this thing
[1:13:57] together.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; So he says, [clears throat]
[1:14:03] Israel in Egypt was not planted. They
[1:14:07] were just set out.
[1:14:09] It wasn't their original home ground.
[1:14:11] And a man that's a Christian that rest
[1:14:14] his eternal destination upon some
[1:14:15] denominational creed, he's not in his
[1:14:17] right mind. He was born to be free
[1:14:21] and a child OF GOD TO WORSHIP GOD. BUT
[1:14:24] HE'S UNDER A CREED. He can't bring forth
[1:14:26] his fruit. Catch this. Yet something in
[1:14:29] him is longing to do it.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; I think we can all say amen to that.
[1:14:38] Listen, I might not be trapped under a
[1:14:39] creed, but sometimes I get trapped under
[1:14:41] my own under my own guilt and trapped
[1:14:44] under my own bad feelings and trapped
[1:14:46] under my own human nonsense.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; OH, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING,
[1:14:50] FRIENDS. I REALIZED WHEN SOLOMON WAS
[1:14:52] TRYING TO put that ter that temple
[1:14:54] together that day, he had all the parts,
[1:14:56] but he had to write a letter say, "I
[1:14:58] need send me therefore a man, SOMEBODY
[1:15:01] WHO'S CUNNING, SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS. I
[1:15:03] JUST I TOOK THAT AND I PREACHED, SEND ME
[1:15:05] THEREFORE A MAN. I NEED THE MAN CHRIST
[1:15:07] JESUS WHO CAN COME DOWN AND TAKE ALL THE
[1:15:09] PARTS THAT ARE ME AND PUT THEM ALL
[1:15:11] TOGETHER AND SO THAT I'M A TEMPLE WHERE
[1:15:14] GOD CAN COME IN AND WE CAN HAVE
[1:15:16] FELLOWSHIP. SEND ME A MAN.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; OH, THERE'S ONLY ONE MAN THAT KNOWS ME
[1:15:21] AND KNOWS ALL MY WEAKNESSES AND KNOWS
[1:15:23] WHERE ALL THE PARTS GO AND CAN FIGURE
[1:15:25] OUT WHERE I'VE MESSED IT ALL UP AND HE
[1:15:27] CAN PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. I JUST SAY,
[1:15:29] "COME QUICKLY, LORD JESUS.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Align my life to your word."
[1:15:34] See,
[1:15:36] AND SO SO HE HE GOES ON HERE.
[1:15:40] He shall be like a tree that's planted
[1:15:44] by the rivers of water. Rivers plural,
[1:15:46] water singular, many rivers coming into
[1:15:48] one channel. In other words, brother
[1:15:50] Brandham says he'll be like a man in the
[1:15:53] scripture that believes all of God's
[1:15:55] word where the power and the nine
[1:15:59] spiritual gifts can flow through one God
[1:16:02] into his innermost being. SO IT'S NOT
[1:16:06] JUST IT'S NOT JUST GIFTS COMING FROM
[1:16:09] heaven and making the TRIP DOWN THROUGH
[1:16:11] THE ATMOSPHERES and flowing through me
[1:16:13] to somewhere. IT'S IT'S LITERALLY THESE
[1:16:16] GIFTS CAN FLOW THROUGH ONE GOD IN MY
[1:16:20] INNERMOST BEING. THAT ONE GOD I'M NOT
[1:16:22] I'M NOT CONNECTED TO ALPHA CENTURI.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; I HE'S VERY PRESENT. HE'S IN ME. HE'S
[1:16:29] AROUND ME. I WANT MY LIFE TO BE A
[1:16:31] CONDUIT SO THAT SO THAT THE WORD CAN GET
[1:16:34] OUT [screaming] SO THAT THE LIGHT CAN
[1:16:35] SHINE.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; SEE, WHAT GOOD IS CHRISTIANITY IF IT'S
[1:16:39] NOT THAT?
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S the point? That's right.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:16:45] SO, SO, SO WE, SO PAUL SAYS
[1:16:49] MAKES a statement, BUT NOW MUCH more in
[1:16:52] my absence, WORK OUT YOUR OWN SALVATION
[1:16:53] with fear and trembling. Interestingly
[1:16:55] enough,
[1:16:57] Brother Brandham, he
[1:17:00] he he takes both sides of that. can find
[1:17:02] this and brother Brandham teaches on it
[1:17:04] and blasphemous names and God's provided
[1:17:08] place of worship and Revelation chapter
[1:17:11] 5 and especially Revelation chapter 5
[1:17:13] where he deals with I'm sure you'll
[1:17:15] you'll be familiar remember he deals
[1:17:17] with Ruth there and it's Ruth uh
[1:17:20] laboring or working and Ruth trusting
[1:17:22] and then Ruth resting and and and and
[1:17:24] he's dealing with that in in the fifth
[1:17:26] chapter of Revelation. I think it's part
[1:17:27] two perhaps. And so, Brother Brandham
[1:17:30] DEALS WITH ALL OF THAT, BOTH SIDES OF
[1:17:31] THAT, HOW THAT, you know, before the new
[1:17:35] birth, because the new birth is a work
[1:17:37] of the Holy Spirit that changes that it
[1:17:40] that divinely heals your soul.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; See, divine healing, you've already
[1:17:45] experienced divine healing in your soul.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; See, you've been born again. The old
[1:17:50] nature WAS ANNIHILATED. NOT IT'S NOT
[1:17:52] THAT THAT OLD NATURE GOT PUT ON A GOT
[1:17:54] PUT UNDER a chain. It's that it was
[1:17:57] annihilated. YOU ARE A BRAND new unit.
[1:18:00] The gene of God that was in you was in
[1:18:02] seed form AND NOW IT'S COME TO LIFE.
[1:18:04] BROTHER BRANDHAM DEALS WITH THAT AND AND
[1:18:06] THERE IS A MAN HERE WHO CAN TURN ON the
[1:18:08] light. See, IT'S NOT THAT WHEN HE SAID
[1:18:10] LET THERE BE LIGHT. BROTHER BRHAM SAYS
[1:18:12] HE WASN'T speaking to the sun. The sun
[1:18:14] was already there. In the beginning, God
[1:18:17] created the heavens and the earth. The
[1:18:19] sun was already there. The earth was
[1:18:20] already there. But over the earth, there
[1:18:22] was a thick billowing blackness and the
[1:18:25] and THE SEED WAS ALREADY IN THE EARTH.
[1:18:28] SEE, BUT THE SUNLIGHT COULDN'T STRIKE
[1:18:30] THE SEED BECAUSE OF THE THICK DARKNESS.
[1:18:32] SO WHEN HE SAID, "LET THERE BE LIGHT,"
[1:18:33] HE WASN'T TALKING TO THE SEED OR THE
[1:18:35] EARTH or the sun or THE SUN, THE SEED OR
[1:18:39] THE EARTH. HE WAS SPEAKING TO THE
[1:18:40] DARKNESS. MOVE AWAY. BREAK APART. BE
[1:18:43] ANNIHILATED. ALLOW THE SUN TO STRIKE THE
[1:18:46] SEED. THAT'S HOW YOU WERE BORN AGAIN OF
[1:18:48] THE SPIRIT OF GOD. THE WORD OF GOD SAID,
[1:18:50] "LET THERE BE LIGHT." AND LIGHT CAME UP
[1:18:52] OUT OF ME.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND IT WAS IT ANNIHILATED
[1:18:55] THAT OLD NATURE. I'M A NEW CREATION IN
[1:18:58] CHRIST JESUS. OLD THINGS HAVE NOT NOT
[1:19:01] BEEN PUT UNDER UNDER A CHAIN. THEY HAVE
[1:19:03] PASSED AWAY.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; ALL THINGS ARE BECOME NEW. WHY? BECAUSE
[1:19:08] SAY, "WELL, BUT I'VE STILL GOT MY FALLEN
[1:19:10] FLESH, MY BODY AND MY SPIRIT, MY 10
[1:19:13] SENSES, YOU KNOW, AND 10 INLETS AND FIVE
[1:19:15] FIVE INLETS, FIVE OUTLETS." AND EXACTLY
[1:19:17] RIGHT. BUT ALL THINGS ARE BECOME NEW
[1:19:20] BECAUSE NOW THERE'S A NEW GOVERNOR.
[1:19:22] THERE'S A NEW KING IN THE HEART. THERE'S
[1:19:23] A NEW THRONE. THERE'S A NEW THINKING.
[1:19:26] THERE'S THERE'S SOMETHING TO TAKE OVER.
[1:19:28] AND WHEN THE BODY WOULD GO BACK ITS OLD
[1:19:30] PATH, THAT NEW NATURE SAYS, "NO, SIR.
[1:19:32] YOU'RE NOT GOING IN THAT DIRECTION."
[1:19:34] WHEN THE BODY WOULD THINK THIS OR THINK
[1:19:36] THAT, AND THAT NEW NATURE SAYS, "CAST
[1:19:38] THAT DOWN. THAT WILL HAVE NO PLACE IN
[1:19:40] HERE. I WILL NOT SHARE MY DOMAIN WITH
[1:19:43] THE POWERS OF THE WORLD." I'M HERE TO
[1:19:46] TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. THERE'S
[1:19:47] LIBERTY AND THERE'S FREEDOM IN THE HOLY
[1:19:49] GHOST. THAT YOU CAN KNOW IT TODAY.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF YOU'RE WILLING TO STRIVE, IF
[1:19:55] YOU'RE WILLING TO PRESS, IF YOU'RE
[1:19:56] WILLING TO LET THE WORD OF GOD DWELL IN
[1:19:59] YOU RICHLY.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO BROTHER BRANDHAM TOOK BOTH SIDES
[1:20:05] OF THAT. YOU KNOW, THE HOW THAT RUTH he
[1:20:08] he I think it's uh I DON'T REMEMBER
[1:20:11] WHICH ONE I BUT IT'S IN ALL THOSE
[1:20:12] MESSAGES and I've studied so DIFFERENT
[1:20:15] MANY OF THEM, BUT I I BELIEVE THERE IN
[1:20:17] IT'S IN uh I believe it's in Revelation
[1:20:18] 5 part two. I don't have the quote in
[1:20:21] front of ME WHERE HE STARTS TALKING
[1:20:22] ABOUT,
[1:20:24] you know, Ruth started out by working
[1:20:26] and he says she's doing her legalism.
[1:20:29] She's getting her works. And see, so
[1:20:31] justification, a lot OF TIMES WE GO
[1:20:34] JUSTIFICATION, SANCTIFICATION, BAPTISM,
[1:20:36] the Holy Ghost. It's the Holy Ghost
[1:20:38] doing all of them.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; See, justification brings you to a
[1:20:42] saving grace and and THAT AND YOU REPENT
[1:20:45] OF YOUR SINS AND IT REMITS ALL YOUR PAST
[1:20:47] SINS. IT DOESN'T HELP YOU FOR THE
[1:20:48] FUTURE, but it but it but IT REMITS ALL
[1:20:51] OF YOUR PAST SINS. AND THEN THE HOLY
[1:20:53] SPIRIT KEEPS WORKING AND STARTS CLEANING
[1:20:55] UP YOUR LIFE. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID
[1:20:57] YOUR OLD YOUR OLD NATURE, YOUR OLD YOUR
[1:21:00] MIND BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT CONVERTED YET.
[1:21:02] AND SO YOUR MIND IS STILL ENMITY. HE
[1:21:04] SAID, "SO FIRST THING HE HAS TO DO IS,
[1:21:06] YOU KNOW, YOU GO THERE INTO EZEKIEL AND
[1:21:07] HE'S GOING TO SPRINKLE CLEAN WATER UPON
[1:21:09] YOU AND HE'S GOING TO PUT A NEW SPIRIT
[1:21:11] ON YOU." BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS HE HAS TO
[1:21:12] GET A NEW SPIRIT PUT ON YOU. THIS IS
[1:21:14] BEFORE HE SAYS, "I'LL PUT MY spirit in
[1:21:16] you." He puts a NEW SPIRIT ON HIM.
[1:21:19] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "SO YOU CAN GET
[1:21:20] ALONG WITH THE HOLY GHOST." AND YOU
[1:21:22] START GOING TO CHURCH AND YOU START
[1:21:24] CLEANING UP YOUR LIFE. AND AND BUT BUT
[1:21:26] REMEMBER THAT THE HOLY GHOST WILL THANK
[1:21:29] YOU, BROTHER MATT. THE HOLY GHOST WILL
[1:21:31] KEEP MOVING YOU IN THAT DIRECTION
[1:21:33] BECAUSE THE THE NEW BIRTH IS I WILL PUT
[1:21:36] MY SPIRIT IN YOU AND CAUSE YOU TO KEEP
[1:21:39] my word and my statutes. SEE,
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; SO A LOT OF TIMES WE BREAK THAT DOWN
[1:21:44] OVER A LONG TIME AND SOMETIMES IT CAN GO
[1:21:46] FOR A WHILE. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO. GOD IN
[1:21:49] A MOMENT, THOSE PEOPLE IN THE UPPER
[1:21:51] ROOM, THAT HAPPENED ALL THE THAT
[1:21:52] HAPPENED TO THEM IN A MOMENT WHEN THE
[1:21:54] DEVOUT JEWS SHOWED UP, THEY WERE ALREADY
[1:21:56] DEVOUT MEN. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE A
[1:21:59] WHOLE LOT OF SANCTIFYING AND THEY BECAME
[1:22:00] A BELIEVER AND WERE FILLED WITH THE HOLY
[1:22:02] GHOST AND BEGAN TO TESTIFY. AND AND YOU
[1:22:04] FOLLOW ON IN THE VERSES, VERSE 39, 40,
[1:22:07] 41, AND 42, THEY THEY WERE BREAKING
[1:22:09] BREAD. THEY WERE IN CHURCH. THEY WERE
[1:22:11] LISTENING TO THE WORD. THEY WERE
[1:22:13] FOLLOWING THE APOSTLES DOCTRINE. THAT'S
[1:22:15] A SIGN OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; A SIGN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE HOLY
[1:22:22] GHOST IS THAT YOU SIT IN A CHURCH FOR
[1:22:24] YEARS AND BELIEVE the truth of it, BUT
[1:22:27] THERE'S NO REAL EFFECTIVE CHANGE IN YOUR
[1:22:30] LIFE AND YOU'RE STILL HALFWORLDLY AND
[1:22:32] HALF GODLY. IF THERE'S SUCH A such a a
[1:22:36] crazy thing, it it's it's it's I'M GOING
[1:22:39] TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. THAT'S
[1:22:41] MISERY. THAT'S MISERY. DON'T LINGER
[1:22:44] THERE. MOVE ON. [screaming] GO ON.
[1:22:46] THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO BE HAD.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; I, YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER SISTER JEAN. I
[1:22:51] TALKED TO HER THIS MORNING.
[1:22:54] I'll just give you an example
[1:22:57] of of that whole process, you know,
[1:22:59] because we HAVE A A PERFECT EXAMPLE HERE
[1:23:01] IN our assembly. Sister Jean who's been
[1:23:03] a believer now 64 years. She's
[1:23:06] 21-year-old young mother. AND YOU KNOW
[1:23:10] YOU YOU FIRST OF ALL AND SO I I THOUGHT
[1:23:12] I HAD IT STRAIGHT AND and I wanted to
[1:23:14] talk to her. I said, "Mom, can you take
[1:23:16] me back?" And and she gave me a quick,
[1:23:18] YOU KNOW, PRIMER ON HER LIFE, YOU KNOW,
[1:23:20] PREVIOUS STARTED OUT AS A YOUNG TEENAGE
[1:23:21] GIRL AND EVEN younger than that. And you
[1:23:24] know, I I SOME THINGS I WANT TO SAY HERE
[1:23:26] THAT FIRST OF ALL, I WANT YOU to
[1:23:28] understand Sister Jean was a North
[1:23:31] Carolina country girl. poor
[1:23:33] just a sassifrass North Carolina country
[1:23:36] girl where in those DAYS EVERYBODY USED
[1:23:40] FOUR-LETTER words everybody smoked it
[1:23:42] was North Carolina
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; I mean that was like the the the smoking
[1:23:46] capital of the nation
[1:23:49] you KNOW AND RJ REYNOLDS AND ALL of
[1:23:50] those AND AND SO YOU KNOW SISTER JEAN
[1:23:53] GREW UP IN THAT environment she she made
[1:23:56] and and THIS WAS JUST AS A YOUNG GIRL
[1:23:58] NOT EVEN NOT EVEN A CHRISTIAN JUST AS A
[1:24:00] YOUNG GIRL YOU WEARING PANTS AND SHORTS
[1:24:03] AND CUTTING HER HAIR AND WEARING MAKEUP
[1:24:05] AND AND HER DADDY, MY GRANDPA, BOUGHT
[1:24:07] HER HER CIGARETTES.
[1:24:10] AND SISTER JEAN WAS SO POOR SHE HAD TO
[1:24:12] MAKE THEM LAST. SHE COULD NEVER THEY SHE
[1:24:14] HAD TO STRETCH THEM OUT. BUT YOU HAVE TO
[1:24:16] UNDERSTAND THIS WAS THIS WAS THE EARLY
[1:24:18] 19, YOU KNOW, LATE 1940S, EARLY 1950S.
[1:24:21] They didn't even know
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; that they were unhealthy. IT WASN'T EVEN
[1:24:25] A THING, YOU KNOW, THAT THAT THAT THAT
[1:24:27] THIS WAS KIND OF THE CULTURE THAT SHE
[1:24:29] WAS RAISED up in.
[1:24:32] and she she made a pact with her
[1:24:36] girlfriend at the time in school, I
[1:24:38] think high school, AND THEY MADE A PACK
[1:24:41] THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO USE FOUR-LETTER
[1:24:43] WORDS. NOW, we're not talking about
[1:24:44] vulgar language. Sister Jean was never a
[1:24:46] vulgar. She was still she was never
[1:24:48] promiscuous. She was none of that. She
[1:24:50] was very decent young girl raised by my
[1:24:53] grandparents were good people and later
[1:24:56] came to be Christians themselves. And
[1:24:57] then you see the product we have today.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; SO, SO, BUT AS A YOUNG GIRL, her and her
[1:25:04] girlfriend made a pack that if if any
[1:25:08] either one of them used a four-letter
[1:25:10] word, they would get slapped. [laughter]
[1:25:14] [gasps] Sister Jean, I said, "Did you
[1:25:15] get slapped?" Oh, I got slapped a a
[1:25:18] bunch of times. So, YOU KNOW, THEY
[1:25:19] INVENTED SLAPPING. THAT'S not new.
[1:25:21] That's that's [laughter]
[1:25:23] these slapping competitions. and and IF
[1:25:25] SHE WOULD LET A WORD OUT, WHAMMY, YOU
[1:25:28] KNOW, AND AND AND BUT THEN SHE GOT TO
[1:25:30] HAVE PAYBACK ON HER GIRLFRIEND.
[1:25:32] AND SO AND AND SO AND SO, YOU KNOW, I
[1:25:36] SAID, "WELL, DID IT DID IT HOLD?" SHE
[1:25:38] SAYS, "NO, IT DIDN'T TAKE THAT FROM ME."
[1:25:40] SHE SAID, "AND EVEN WHEN I WHEN I GOT
[1:25:42] MARRIED AND JUST A young woman," she
[1:25:44] said, you know, and she she went another
[1:25:46] direction. she got married, we lost
[1:25:47] track. And she said that, SHE SAID,
[1:25:50] "FINALLY," SHE SAID, "I ME AND YOUR DAD,
[1:25:53] WE FOUND OURSELVES IN A BAPTIST church
[1:25:55] and we came under the preaching of the
[1:25:57] gospel." AND HER GRANDMOTHER GOT saved
[1:25:59] and her f her gr her her mother got
[1:26:02] saved and her father got saved and and
[1:26:04] they began to clean up the home and and
[1:26:07] these were just old country people and
[1:26:09] and so SISTER JEAN JUST A YOUNG WOMAN
[1:26:13] AND THEY COME INTO A BAPTIST CHURCH AND
[1:26:15] SHE COAST TO AN ALTAR AND SHE FALLS DOWN
[1:26:18] IN REPENTANCE THE HOLY SPIRIT IN A
[1:26:20] BAPTIST CHURCH CONVICTED her see AND SHE
[1:26:23] GAVE HER HEART TO THE LORD IN
[1:26:25] JUSTIFICATION REPENTED OF ALL OF HER
[1:26:27] SINS HANDS, MY FATHER ALONG WITH HER.
[1:26:29] And from that moment, from that moment,
[1:26:34] that that KIND OF LANGUAGE USAGE passed
[1:26:37] away from her. SHE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
[1:26:39] ABOUT the message yet. IMMEDIATELY, YOU
[1:26:42] KNOW, SHE STARTED TO BE CONVICTED UH
[1:26:44] ABOUT WEARING PANTS. AND SO, SHE STOPPED
[1:26:46] WEARING SHORTS AND SHE STOPPED AND and
[1:26:48] then and then the whole thing was AND I
[1:26:51] SAID, "WELL, WHAT ABOUT CUTTING YOUR
[1:26:52] HAIR?" SHE SAID, "OH, THAT WAS THE ONE
[1:26:54] OF THE MOST WONDERFUL THINGS." SHE SAID,
[1:26:55] "BECAUSE I always loved I always wanted
[1:26:59] long hair." She said, "I thought it
[1:27:01] looked so beautiful, but the trend of
[1:27:02] the day was to the bob and you cut it
[1:27:04] off or you know and and and it's
[1:27:06] convenient." And and and and she said,
[1:27:08] "WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE THAT THE
[1:27:11] BIBLE FORBID A WOMAN TO CUT HER HAIR,"
[1:27:13] SHE SAID, "THAT WAS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST
[1:27:14] DAYS OF MY LIFE." SHE SAID, "I THOUGHT,
[1:27:17] PRAISE THE LORD. GOD WANTS IT. I WANT
[1:27:18] IT. LET'S DO IT."
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND SO SHE WENT FORWARD AND AND
[1:27:22] AND THEN YOU KNOW LATER ON SHE SHE FINDS
[1:27:24] OUT AND YOU KNOW BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS
[1:27:27] ABOUT THAT BLUE STUFF AND she never was
[1:27:29] a a Jezebel type but she had some
[1:27:31] LIPSTICK AND SOME EYES SHADOW BUT SHE
[1:27:34] LOVED that blue. She just loved it. She
[1:27:37] just oh my goodness that is so
[1:27:39] beautiful. And then she SHE COMES INTO
[1:27:41] CONTACT AND THE LORD BEGAN TO CONVICT
[1:27:43] HER OF THAT. AND AWAY THAT WENT AND YOU
[1:27:45] KNOW AND AND AND THEN SHE FOUND OUT SHE
[1:27:48] GOT NEAR A BELIEVER AND AND THE WOMAN
[1:27:50] WALKED BY AND SAID, YOU KNOW, IF YOU GET
[1:27:52] ENOUGH OF THE HOLY GHOST, HE'LL TAKE
[1:27:53] THOSE BRIDGES AWAY FROM YOU AND PUT YOU
[1:27:55] IN A DRESS. THE PROBLEM WAS, YOU KNOW,
[1:27:57] SHE HAD ALMOST NO SHE HAD LIKE ONE
[1:27:59] DRESS.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; HER ENTIRE CLOSET WAS FULL OF FULL OF
[1:28:02] PANTS CUZ THAT WAS THE CULTURE. THAT'S
[1:28:03] HOW SHE GREW UP. SEE? And and but BUT
[1:28:07] THERE WAS SOMETHING PULLING HER.
[1:28:08] SOMETHING WAS SANCTIFYING HER. WHAT WAS
[1:28:10] HAPPENING? YOU KNOW, RUTH, BEFORE RUTH
[1:28:13] GOT BOAZ, SHE HAD THESE KINDS OF THINGS
[1:28:15] THAT WERE HAPPENING AND SHE HAD TO
[1:28:17] DEMONSTRATE. AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN
[1:28:19] JUSTIFICATION, SANCTIFICATION, IT MAY
[1:28:21] ALL HAPPEN IN A MOMENT. OR LIKE SISTER
[1:28:23] JEAN, GOD TOOK HER AND MY DAD THROUGH
[1:28:25] NINE OR 10 MONTHS CLEANING THEM UP,
[1:28:27] CLEANING THEM UP, CLEANING THEM UP,
[1:28:29] TAKING THIS AWAY, THAT AWAY. AND
[1:28:31] FINALLY, WHEN MY AUNT MARGARET GOT HIM
[1:28:33] INTO A MESSAGE CHURCH, MY MOM SAYS, "AS
[1:28:35] SOON AS I WALKED IN THE DOOR, I KNEW I
[1:28:38] WAS HOME." AND RIGHT AWAY, SHE WANTED
[1:28:40] MORE OF THE GOD, SHE WANTED THE HOLY
[1:28:42] GHOST. RIGHT AWAY, HER HAIR IS GROWING,
[1:28:44] THE MAKEUP'S GONE, THE CIGARETTES ARE
[1:28:46] GONE, THE CURSING IS GONE, THE PANTS ARE
[1:28:48] GONE. SHE'S AT SHE'S STANDING IN A POOL
[1:28:50] OF WATER WANTING THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:28:53] GHOST. NINE MONTHS PREGNANT WITH ME. AND
[1:28:55] WHEN SHE COME UP, WHEN SHE WENT DOWN
[1:28:56] INTO THAT WATER AND ME WITH HER, SHE
[1:28:58] COME UP AND ME WITH HER, BAPTIZED IN THE
[1:29:01] HOLY GHOST. I WAS I WAS IN THE HOLY
[1:29:03] GHOST IN MY MOTHER'S WOMB.
[1:29:05] [laughter]
[1:29:08] AMEN. PRAISE THE LORD. I'M KEN TO JOHN.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; And I'm HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING,
[1:29:13] FRIENDS. YOU SEE HOW THAT WORKS? YOU SEE
[1:29:15] HOW GOD TOOK HER OVER NINE OR 10 MONTHS
[1:29:18] AND SAVED HER, CLEANED HER UP, CLEANED
[1:29:20] HER UP, AND THEN FILLED HER WITH THE
[1:29:21] HOLY GHOST. AND FROM THAT HOUR NOW,
[1:29:24] BROTHER BRANDHAM FLIPS THE OTHER SIDE.
[1:29:25] [screaming] NOW RUTH IS RESTING. NOW
[1:29:27] IT'S NOT HER TRYING TO DO IT. IT'S THE
[1:29:30] HOLY SPIRIT LIVING INSIDE HER. AND 64
[1:29:33] YEARS LATER, SHE'S NEVER DESIRED IT
[1:29:35] AGAIN. SHE'S A SHE HER SHE'S LET HER
[1:29:38] LIGHT SHINE TO THE WORLD.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; AND SHE'S 85 YEARS OLD LIKE CALEB. JUST
[1:29:44] LIKE CALEB, SHE'S JUST AS STRONG IN HER
[1:29:47] FAITH TODAY AND READY TO GO TO WAR
[1:29:49] AGAINST SATAN AND READY TO WITNESS TO
[1:29:52] ANYONE WHO WILL GET WITHIN TWO FEET OF
[1:29:53] HER.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS.
[1:29:56] THERE'S POWER IN THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:29:58] SPIRIT.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S THE WAY GOD THAT'S THE WAY HE
[1:30:04] RODE THROUGH MY MOM AND DAD.
[1:30:08] SEE? SO,
[1:30:11] SO WE FIND THEN THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:30:14] SAYS HERE, AND I'M GOING TO turn turn
[1:30:16] for the finish line.
[1:30:19] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS IN THE ONCOMING
[1:30:21] STORM, WE'VE got an oncoming storm.
[1:30:26] The church
[1:30:28] doesn't make you a Christian.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; The church only helps you to be a
[1:30:34] Christian.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:37] helps you to remain
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; what you've been born into.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; So I would think that it should be a
[1:30:45] priority.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; The church doesn't make you a Christian.
[1:30:51] The church only helps you to be a
[1:30:53] Christian. Helps you to remain what
[1:30:55] you've been born into. Helps you to
[1:30:57] contain your experience while you're
[1:31:01] fellowshipping together with brethren of
[1:31:04] like precious faith. Because that's so
[1:31:06] well said you can't even improve on
[1:31:07] that.
[1:31:11] Jesus said
[1:31:14] [snorts] as it was in the days of Sodom.
[1:31:18] Look what kind of a life they were
[1:31:19] living. And Jesus compared that day to
[1:31:21] this day. Sinful.
[1:31:24] WATCH WHEN LOT WENT TO TELL HIS PEOPLE.
[1:31:26] They laughed of him. Laughed at him.
[1:31:27] Made fun of him. The sins of the city
[1:31:29] vexed his righteous soul.
[1:31:32] The angel's message didn't stir them.
[1:31:34] had no effect on them. But they were
[1:31:36] asked to come out because judgment was
[1:31:38] upon the city and God was going to bring
[1:31:40] a storm of fire upon the city and they
[1:31:42] refused to walk.
[1:31:44] They refused to come out.
[1:31:47] They were satisfied with their sins.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; That takes my breath away. I can't I
[1:31:54] can't imagine that someone can look at
[1:31:56] the kind of day that we live in today
[1:32:00] and have the kind of word that God has
[1:32:02] sent us in this hour. What a contrast
[1:32:06] between the word and the world. And how
[1:32:10] anyone can come face to face with the
[1:32:13] word and all of its purity and all of
[1:32:14] its cleanness and all of its
[1:32:16] wholesomeness and all of its life and
[1:32:17] its eternal life and its joy and it and
[1:32:20] and its beauty and the fragrance of
[1:32:22] beauty and holiness and somehow still
[1:32:26] want to choose the world. But I will
[1:32:28] tell you that your fallen nature is
[1:32:31] trying to do that. And God is trying to
[1:32:33] get you to be like Ruth and just start
[1:32:35] moving toward him. And he'll start
[1:32:38] working in your life and start cleaning
[1:32:39] you up and and and and and if you'll and
[1:32:42] and as you follow, if we we will know
[1:32:45] the Lord if we follow on to know him.
[1:32:48] See? And so as you follow him, friends,
[1:32:51] he'll take you from justification,
[1:32:53] sanctification to the new birth and
[1:32:55] beyond and on. AND YOU'LL BECOME, AS
[1:32:57] PAUL WAS SAYING TO US, YOU'LL BECOME
[1:32:59] BLAMELESS. YOU'LL BECOME PURE. YOU'LL
[1:33:02] BECOME A BRIGHT AND SHINING LIGHT.
[1:33:05] THERE'S A JOURNEY OF A LIFETIME. AND
[1:33:06] IT'S AND IT'S AND IT'S YOU'RE JOURNEYING
[1:33:08] IT UNTIL WE'RE TAKEN HOME.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's THE IT'S THE LACK OF
[1:33:15] seeing the oncoming storm.
[1:33:19] It's the nonchalant,
[1:33:21] NON-CARE ABOUT JUST LET'S JUST KEEP
[1:33:23] GOING. THE WORLD will just keep going.
[1:33:26] It won't. It can't.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; There are so many prophecies that are
[1:33:30] taking place right now. THINK AND AND
[1:33:34] YOU KNOW, WE WE HAVE SUCH a a more sure
[1:33:38] word of prophecy because there are so
[1:33:41] many things that WERE PROPHESIED TO TAKE
[1:33:44] PLACE RIGHT NEAR THE END TIME. AND WE'RE
[1:33:46] ACTUALLY CAN SEE THEM ALREADY started
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; and we can see them in development. And
[1:33:51] we and we GOT OTHER THINGS THAT ARE
[1:33:52] HAPPENING AT an alarmingly fast rate.
[1:33:55] AND I I WAS saying to you, you know, at
[1:33:57] at the again, I don't want this to be an
[1:34:00] INFORMATION SHOW, BUT BUT YOU KNOW, I
[1:34:03] MEAN, EVEN EVEN governments and and and
[1:34:06] and the markets and everyone and the
[1:34:09] gold standard and and and and um Bitcoin
[1:34:12] and things like that, you can't believe
[1:34:14] the whole world is transitioning rapidly
[1:34:18] AND AND CATHOLIC NATIONS ARE STARTING TO
[1:34:20] GATHER UP GOLD. AND BROTHER BRANDAMAN
[1:34:22] SHOWED US IN THE BIBLE, HE SAYS THE
[1:34:24] JEWS, Wall Street, they hold the the
[1:34:28] paper, the bonds, AND THAT THAT THE
[1:34:31] VATICAN CONTROLS THE METAL, THE GOLD,
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT JUST ALL UH IN VATICAN
[1:34:37] CITY, IT'S BECAUSE LISTEN FRIENDS, THAT
[1:34:40] THAT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THAT WHEN
[1:34:42] THE BIBLE TALKS ABOUT THAT THE WHOLE
[1:34:44] world shall WORSHIP THE BEAST, THE WHOLE
[1:34:47] world
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; shall worship the beast and they'll ALL
[1:34:49] GIVE THEIR POWER OVER TO THE BEAST. THEY
[1:34:52] WON'T BE ABLE TO NOT DO IT. IF THEY WANT
[1:34:54] TO STAY A NATION, IF THEY WANT TO STAY A
[1:34:56] BUSINESS, IF THEY WANT TO KEEP FOOD ON
[1:34:58] THEIR TABLE, I'M SO GLAD I'M ESCAPING
[1:35:01] THAT. I'M SO GLAD I HAVE A THIRD EXODUS
[1:35:04] THAT IS UPON ME.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH MY FRIENDS, I DON'T WANT
[1:35:08] TO GET SO SIDETRACKED, BUT THESE THESE
[1:35:10] ARE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; AND THEY ACTUALLY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ONE
[1:35:16] OF THE MOST PROBABLY IF NOT THE MOST
[1:35:18] CONSEQUENTIAL PRESIDENT WE'VE EVER HAD.
[1:35:20] NOT BECAUSE HE'S SOME GREAT GUY.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; THE MAN IS QUITE VILE. AND A LOT OF THE
[1:35:25] LEADERS of of tech, EVEN ONES THAT I
[1:35:28] FOLLOW, THEY'RE THEY'RE QUITE VILE. AND
[1:35:31] AND I AND I DON'T FOLLOW THEM OUT OF
[1:35:33] SOME SOME FANBOYISM. I FOLLOW THEM JUST
[1:35:36] TO SO THAT I CAN SEE WHERE WE ARE IN
[1:35:38] PROPHECY.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; BUT AS SOON AS THEY THEY GET YOU GET A
[1:35:41] LITTLE BUBBLE, THEY'LL BURST IT ON YOU.
[1:35:42] AND AND I JUST REALIZE THERE'S NO CLEAN
[1:35:45] PLACE EXCEPT RIGHT HERE. THERE'S JUST NO
[1:35:47] CLEAN PLACE. YOU CAN YOU CAN BE A FAN OF
[1:35:50] WHATEVER YOU WANT. YOU CAN GET
[1:35:51] INFORMATION. YOU CAN HAVE WHATEVER. BUT
[1:35:53] THERE'S NO CLEAN PLACE. THE BIBLE SAID
[1:35:55] ALL OF THEIR TABLES ARE FULL OF VOMIT.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; OH FRIENDS, I I WANT TO I WANT TO SEE
[1:36:01] YOU DRAWING FROM THE TREE OF LIFE.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; You're never YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ESCAPE
[1:36:06] THE EFFECTS OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE.
[1:36:07] YOU MAKE USE of them. This is the tree
[1:36:09] of knowledge.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? THIS IS THE TREE OF
[1:36:13] KNOWLEDGE.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; This is the tree OF KNOWLEDGE. THIS IS
[1:36:17] THIS IS A BOOK BY A PUBLISHER PRINTED ON
[1:36:19] PAPER AND PUT IN A BOOK AND SOLD
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; THAT THAT WHERE DO YOU THINK THAT
[1:36:24] BROTHER BRANDON TALKS ABOUT HOW GOD GAVE
[1:36:26] INSPIRATION for that BECAUSE OF THE
[1:36:28] REFORMATION THEY HAD TO HAVE A WAY TO
[1:36:30] MASSPRODUCE NEW BIBLES. BUT LISTEN
[1:36:32] FRIENDS, IT IT ALL COMES FROM THE TREE
[1:36:35] OF KNOWLEDGE AND civilization which is
[1:36:36] of THE DEVIL AND WILL PERISH.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; IT NOT WILL PERISH, IT IS PERISHING.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND SO THE WHOLE WORLD IS CHANGING
[1:36:46] SO RAPIDLY.
[1:36:49] And I can I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE
[1:36:51] ANTICHRIST SYSTEM is moving to where IT
[1:36:54] CONTROLS AND CAN BY COMMERCE and through
[1:36:57] craft force the world into submission.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; It's already happened. IT'S ALREADY
[1:37:05] HAPPENING and it will continue to
[1:37:08] happen. This isn't a fairy tale.
[1:37:11] The world is transitioning and you can't
[1:37:14] stay here.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; THE ONLY WAY OUT IS UP.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE ONCOMING storm
[1:37:22] and brother Brandham, you know, he
[1:37:26] he TALKS ABOUT HERE, HE SAYS
[1:37:29] THEY WERE SATISFIED
[1:37:31] IN THEIR SINS.
[1:37:33] You know, we have let me just give you
[1:37:36] this final key. I I I I wanted to read I
[1:37:40] wanted just to read you real quick
[1:37:41] before I forget it. A good friend of
[1:37:43] mine, Brother Mark Coffee, transcribes
[1:37:45] all the sermons I preach here. Helps me,
[1:37:47] especially it's so helpful when I'm in
[1:37:49] the middle of series and I'm wondering
[1:37:50] what have I preached, what have I
[1:37:51] covered because I'm preaching online and
[1:37:53] sometimes I go back and forth and lose
[1:37:54] track of where I'm at. And uh he we were
[1:37:58] talking and he he said this in an email
[1:38:00] to me this morning. He'd listened to
[1:38:01] part seven of uh my recent series and he
[1:38:04] says changes happening in the world now
[1:38:07] which are happening at a very fast pace
[1:38:11] and it is happening openly and watched
[1:38:13] worldwide. You can see the world leaders
[1:38:15] are shaking their heads trying to
[1:38:16] understand what is going on in the
[1:38:18] world. That shows that it's not them
[1:38:20] doing it because they don't know what is
[1:38:22] happening either and things are really
[1:38:24] starting to move in place quickly on
[1:38:25] both sides. Look up.
[1:38:29] And I said, ' That's well said, brother
[1:38:30] Mark.
[1:38:33] When I think about here, we have
[1:38:38] a mere
[1:38:40] a mere scientific
[1:38:43] prediction of a storm. Said, "Well, no,
[1:38:46] the radar, it's there. You can see it."
[1:38:48] Well, they're but they predicted it was
[1:38:50] coming. They're predicting where it'll
[1:38:51] go.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; It's all just, you know, scientific
[1:38:56] calculation and prediction.
[1:38:59] reliable but not foolproof.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; And it's gotten way better.
[1:39:04] Entire states
[1:39:06] declare in advance of it even arriving.
[1:39:10] THEY HEAR THE PREDICTIONS BEFORE IT EVEN
[1:39:13] GETS THERE. ENTIRE STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE
[1:39:15] DECLARING STATES OF EMERGENCY. I I
[1:39:17] looked at the map. Half of this went all
[1:39:19] the way across the lower southern and
[1:39:22] upper Midwest and up into the north of
[1:39:25] states already who had went into states
[1:39:27] of emergency.
[1:39:29] Federal agencies already start gearing
[1:39:32] up for disaster relief. predictions
[1:39:36] while helpful
[1:39:38] and they've COME A LONG WAY WITH THEIR
[1:39:40] ACCURACY, but they're they're BASED
[1:39:43] MERELY ON SCIENTIFIC calculations
[1:39:46] with known margins of error.
[1:39:50] Those those margins of error are known
[1:39:52] to exist. Why you think they have so
[1:39:54] many models?
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Say, well, they have the American model
[1:39:57] and the European model. That's a such an
[1:39:59] oversimplification.
[1:40:00] They have they have over a hundred
[1:40:03] various in things that they use to track
[1:40:06] and and and and 40% will agree with 60%.
[1:40:11] And and the science contradicts itself
[1:40:13] sometimes sometimes and all they can do
[1:40:15] is make their their best educated guess.
[1:40:18] And you know, EVERYONE WHEN THIS STARTS
[1:40:21] HAPPENING AND STATES ARE DECLARING
[1:40:22] EMERGENCIES and meteorologists ARE
[1:40:24] GIVING THESE CALCULATED MODELS AND AND
[1:40:27] FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE ON THE move and
[1:40:28] everyone is jumping through rings of
[1:40:30] fire TO GET READY AND TAKE PRECAUTIONS
[1:40:32] and they THEY MAKE SACRIFICES AND THEY
[1:40:35] OPERATE IN WAYS THAT THEY HUMAN BEINGS
[1:40:37] OPERATE IN WAYS WE WOULDN'T NORMALLY
[1:40:39] OPERATE. You know, Monday morning WE GET
[1:40:41] UP, WE GO TO WORK, HERE'S MY JOB, HERE'S
[1:40:42] MY WE GO to school, we come home, WE
[1:40:43] EAT. NOW EVERYBODY'S SCRAMBLING. YOU
[1:40:46] KNOW, THE JOBS ARE GOING TO BE CLOSED
[1:40:47] DOWN. THERE'S ICE COMING. SCHOOLS ARE
[1:40:49] SHUT DOWN. WE WHAT HAVE WE GOT TO DO?
[1:40:50] WHAT HAVE WE GOT TO DO? WE HAVE THIS
[1:40:50] PREPARATION, THAT PREPARATION. THE
[1:40:52] PEOPLE UP IN THERE HAVE BEEN PREPARING
[1:40:53] FOR NO POWER AND, YOU KNOW, and and
[1:40:56] frozen roads.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; AND SO, AND IT'S ALL BASED MERELY ON
[1:41:02] SCIENTIFIC CALCULATIONS WITH KNOWN
[1:41:05] ERRORS.
[1:41:07] THEY AND THEY COMPARE THESE VARIOUS
[1:41:09] COMPUTER MODELS WEEKS IN ADVANCE. AND
[1:41:12] EVERYONE IS TAKING PRECAUTIONS AND
[1:41:14] EVERYONE IS MAKING SACRIFICES AND
[1:41:16] EVERYONE IS OPERATING IN UNUSUAL WAYS.
[1:41:19] And yet
[1:41:22] we have scriptural prophecy.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; AN ELEMENT, MAY I SAY, OF A SINGLE
[1:41:30] OMNISIENT, ALL- KNOWING, ALL POWERFUL
[1:41:33] MIND WHO'S KNOWN TO NEVER BE WRONG,
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; WHO'S KNOWN TO HAVE NEVER MADE A
[1:41:39] MISTAKE. AND YOU YOU THINK AN ONCOMING
[1:41:42] STORM, THE ONE THAT'S HERE IS PEANUTS
[1:41:45] COMPARED TO THE ONE THIS ONE IS
[1:41:47] PROPHESYING.
[1:41:48] I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS.
[1:41:50] THIS ISN'T A COMPUTER MODEL. THIS ISN'T
[1:41:52] MATHEMATICAL CALCULATIONS. THIS IS THE
[1:41:54] WORD OF GOD. THE EARTH IS PASSING AWAY
[1:41:57] FROM ITS CURRENT SITUATION. AND A NEW
[1:42:00] DAY [screaming] IS DAWNING.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT DAY.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; I WANT IT TO MOVE THROUGH MY LIFE. I
[1:42:08] WANT TO MOVE ACCORDING TO WHAT THE WORD
[1:42:11] HAS TOLD ME. I WANT TO BE CAREFUL WHERE
[1:42:12] IT TELLS ME TO BE CAREFUL. PREPARE WHERE
[1:42:14] IT TELLS ME TO BE PREPARED. AMEN.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; This is not a time
[1:42:21] to be slowing down or letting the pied
[1:42:24] piper of Leodysa
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; put you to sleep
[1:42:30] with his music and his entertainment and
[1:42:34] HIS RECREATION AND HIS EDUCATION AND HIS
[1:42:36] CIVILIZATION AND HIS GOVERNMENT AND ALL
[1:42:39] OF THESE THINGS. THESE ARE NECESSARY
[1:42:41] elements
[1:42:42] to life in the 21st century.
[1:42:47] But I plan to be alive in the 22nd
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; and 23rd and 24th and 25th and 26th.
[1:42:55] I'll still be alive in the 27th. I will
[1:42:59] never have died
[1:43:02] and I'll still be alive.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Is that your desire? Friends, this is a
[1:43:10] a year that's
[1:43:12] going to be seismic. And I I say that
[1:43:16] with a lot of consideration. I don't
[1:43:17] just throw that out there.
[1:43:20] It's going to certainly within the next
[1:43:23] 36 months you will see changes like you
[1:43:28] can't even imagine.
[1:43:30] And it's not coming. I cannot underscore
[1:43:34] that enough. It's not coming. It's
[1:43:36] happening.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; It's already moving. Yeah,
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; I like I say, I could just take my whole
[1:43:43] I could take another hour, two hours and
[1:43:46] just update you on how it's moving and
[1:43:48] where it's headed as best we can tell.
[1:43:52] All I But but you know what it would be?
[1:43:54] It' be a mere prediction. But let's
[1:43:56] stick with what we know to be true.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; I know if it doesn't end today and it
[1:44:01] doesn't end tomorrow, it's still ending.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; I know that when it transitions, I'm
[1:44:06] leaving.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; How do I know that? because I have
[1:44:10] allowed this to become my guide.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; I have believed the report. They asked
[1:44:16] Jesus, "How can we do the works of God?"
[1:44:19] His answer was straightforward and o and
[1:44:22] overly simplistic. When they said, "How
[1:44:24] can we do the works of God?" Jesus said,
[1:44:26] "Believe on him whom God hath sent."
[1:44:29] This is the works of God.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; I want to believe on everything that he
[1:44:33] has sent to me in this age. Amen.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; How about you, Bethl Tabernacle?
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Why don't you stand with me?
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:48] So, that's where we are, friends, in
[1:44:50] 2026. We're going forward. [snorts] I
[1:44:53] want you to be in prayer over the
[1:44:54] projects that we laid out, my own
[1:44:57] personal projects that I'm working on.
[1:44:59] Um, whether they'll ever get completed,
[1:45:03] I have no idea. Hopefully not.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; I'm just being quite serious. Hopefully
[1:45:10] not,
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; you know, and whatever I have of them,
[1:45:13] maybe somebody will find in inner ears
[1:45:16] and maybe figure out a way to not take
[1:45:18] the mark of the beast. I don't know.
[1:45:20] I've got a a a bookcase full of eternal
[1:45:24] life words.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; I It was so beautiful to me. I was
[1:45:27] unpacking and I had had to wait till I
[1:45:29] got my bookcase that I had ordered and
[1:45:30] and I was just unpacking all my precious
[1:45:33] books and and everything and my old
[1:45:35] Bibles and I was looking through old
[1:45:36] notes and my such nostalgia and it's
[1:45:39] hard to believe that we're here and that
[1:45:41] was decades and in the making and and uh
[1:45:46] and it it just it just u it's hard to
[1:45:48] [music] stay a breast of it but I just
[1:45:51] thought Lord [clears throat]
[1:45:52] and I told I told my wife I said cuz my
[1:45:55] daughter-in-law is coming in and she's
[1:45:57] kind of the boss of how things get
[1:45:58] decorated in the house. And so I said,
[1:46:00] "Tell Martha, do not move my book. She
[1:46:03] can [music] do anything else. Move any
[1:46:04] direct decoration. Decorate how she
[1:46:06] wants to. Nothing pink, but otherwise
[1:46:08] she can decorate it how she wants, but
[1:46:10] do not touch my books. They are
[1:46:11] sacrosan, never to be touched." And so I
[1:46:14] love them. I have them on display. I'm
[1:46:15] so proud of them. Amen. And I thought,
[1:46:18] my goodness, I've read through or
[1:46:20] entirely almost every book on this. It
[1:46:22] was stacks and stacks [music] of them.
[1:46:24] And you just accumulate life going
[1:46:26] forward, don't you? You know, and you
[1:46:28] look back and you go, "My oh." And I
[1:46:31] when I look back, I say, "It's been
[1:46:33] worth it.
[1:46:35] It's been worth it." [music] Brother
[1:46:36] Jason, are you are you satisfied having
[1:46:39] been a Christian all these years? My
[1:46:41] only [music] regret is I didn't do it
[1:46:44] way sooner. I love the Lord. I love the
[1:46:47] word. I love his people. I love the
[1:46:51] promises of God there. Yay and amen. and
[1:46:54] they're trustworthy. [music]
[1:46:55] Amen. Praise the Lord. I want you to bow
[1:46:58] your heads with me.
[1:47:04] [clears throat]
[1:47:06] Father, we thank you for this word
[1:47:09] today.
[1:47:11] Thank you for the strength [music] I
[1:47:14] feel in body
[1:47:16] that I felt ministering. And I pray
[1:47:19] you'll be with me now afterwards, Lord,
[1:47:22] and
[1:47:23] keep me from the hand of the enemy.
[1:47:26] We have others who are sick and
[1:47:28] suffering.
[1:47:30] And we have needs before you, Lord.
[1:47:33] You're well aware. And we're looking to
[1:47:36] see you move in a mighty way on some of
[1:47:38] these needs, very serious needs. Our
[1:47:42] loved ones here at Bethl Tabernacle, we
[1:47:44] want to see them in complete victory,
[1:47:47] Lord.
[1:47:49] And I pray that you will give us fresh
[1:47:52] vision going forward these projects,
[1:47:55] Lord, that we have going on at Bethl
[1:47:57] Tabernacle, whether it's uh a new
[1:48:00] school, whether it's a fellowship hall
[1:48:02] and church renovations, whether it's
[1:48:04] missionary work abroad,
[1:48:08] Lord, what whatever whatever all of the
[1:48:12] different things that [music] we have
[1:48:13] going on, may you bless it. May you
[1:48:16] bless me in my personal endeavors and
[1:48:18] keep us true and keep us faithful. Your
[1:48:21] mercies were new to [music] me this
[1:48:22] morning and I love the thought that
[1:48:25] they'll be new again tomorrow morning.
[1:48:28] May I ever may I ever avail [music]
[1:48:31] myself of all that you have given and
[1:48:34] done. When I think about the record of
[1:48:37] the saints down through the ages, Lord,
[1:48:39] I want to take my place. want to take my
[1:48:41] place, Lord, in that long line of
[1:48:43] warriors [music]
[1:48:45] that have successfully
[1:48:47] walked through their entire life, Lord,
[1:48:49] from the day they knew you going forward
[1:48:52] now, Lord, all the way to the
[1:48:54] consummation of their life or the
[1:48:56] consummation of the ages. There's going
[1:48:58] to be an age where there will be those
[1:49:00] who are alive and remain. There's going
[1:49:02] to be some people who are still alive
[1:49:05] and remain at the [music] coming of the
[1:49:07] Lord. I want to be one of them. I
[1:49:10] believe I will be. But Lord, I
[1:49:14] I want to make sure that my [music] life
[1:49:16] is worthy right now. May you grant it to
[1:49:19] us today. May you let the word fall
[1:49:22] that's fell into the hearts of the
[1:49:23] people [music] here and across the
[1:49:26] internet. Lord, may it be quickened by
[1:49:28] the Holy Spirit. That's what a prophet
[1:49:30] [music] taught us. That the word is
[1:49:32] unsealed when a seal is broken and
[1:49:35] what's on the inside is re revealed. And
[1:49:37] then down comes an anointing [music]
[1:49:39] upon that word to make it live. I want
[1:49:42] it to live, Lord. May you grant it to
[1:49:45] us. I commit this whole audience and all
[1:49:48] of the unseen audience into your hands.
[1:49:50] Our physical needs, our financial needs,
[1:49:53] our emotional, mental, spiritual,
[1:49:55] whatever those needs are.
[1:49:58] May you be very gracious to us, Lord,
[1:50:00] and strengthen us. We [music] pray
[1:50:02] again, Lord, for all those in the path
[1:50:03] of the storm. Keep them safe. keep them
[1:50:06] under your care in Jesus name. [music]
[1:50:10] Amen. Let's sing, brother. I want
[1:50:13] [singing] that holy life. I want that
[1:50:18] holy [singing] way. I want to be free
[1:50:23] [music] from strife and do what Jesus
[1:50:27] [singing]
[1:50:28] said.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; I [music] want that holy
[1:50:34] life. I want that [music] holy life.
[1:50:39] Sing it.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; I want that holy [music]
[1:50:42] way. Let me hear it.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; I want to be free [singing]
[1:50:46] from strife and do [music] what Jesus
[1:50:50] said.
[1:50:52] I want that holy [music and singing]
[1:50:55] holy.
[1:50:57] I want that holy loss burning [music]
[1:51:02] deep down in my soul. I want Lord Jesus
[1:51:07] [music]
[1:51:08] [singing] Christ to take complete
[1:51:12] control.
[1:51:13] [music] I want that [singing] holy
[1:51:18] life. So beautiful.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; I want that holy life.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Do you want I want that holy life. Is
[1:51:26] that a [singing and music] great desire?
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; I want to be free from strife and do
[1:51:33] what Jesus [music] said.
[1:51:36] I want that [singing]
[1:51:40] [music]
[1:51:40] again. I want that holy [singing]
[1:51:45] life. I [music] want that holy way. I
[1:51:50] want to be free from strife [music] and
[1:51:54] do what Jesus said.
[1:51:58] I want that holy [music]
[1:52:02] life.
[1:52:07] Bow our heads one more time.
[1:52:11] You give me [music] just a moment to be
[1:52:13] obedient and sensitive to the Holy
[1:52:15] Spirit.
[1:52:19] The Lord informs me that there's some in
[1:52:22] here that,
[1:52:23] you know, the word found you out today.
[1:52:27] You know, it did.
[1:52:29] Not going to call anybody out. I don't
[1:52:30] know who it is,
[1:52:32] but the Holy Spirit's speaking to my
[1:52:34] heart now.
[1:52:36] It might be someone who's
[1:52:39] coming through the process of
[1:52:40] justification, [music] sanctification,
[1:52:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost, and you're on
[1:52:45] your path. And maybe you just want to
[1:52:47] say, "Lord, give me strength to complete
[1:52:49] my journey all the way to the new
[1:52:51] birth." Yeah. Now, see there, I didn't
[1:52:53] even ask for hands and hands going up.
[1:52:55] Keep those heads bowed.
[1:52:57] Maybe you're a believer full of the Holy
[1:52:59] Ghost, but you know that we're still
[1:53:01] here and you're not home [music] yet,
[1:53:02] and you want strength to redouble. Oh,
[1:53:06] Lord God, I like Brother Brandham. Let
[1:53:07] me raise my both hands to God. Let me
[1:53:10] live like that. Let that be me. Let let
[1:53:12] he and his word
[1:53:15] be my whole life.
[1:53:18] Father, [music]
[1:53:21] we're giving
[1:53:23] everyone an opportunity under the sound
[1:53:25] of my voice.
[1:53:27] Often, Lord, I would sing a few times
[1:53:30] and [music] turn away and leave the
[1:53:32] worship leader leading worship and the
[1:53:34] people singing, take a seat and just
[1:53:36] seemed like, Lord, I felt a prompt
[1:53:37] [music] from the Holy Spirit
[1:53:41] to give everyone an opportunity to reach
[1:53:43] out to you right now for everything that
[1:53:46] you need. And you know the word, you
[1:53:49] know that, like the Bible says, we look
[1:53:52] in the [music] word and it's like a
[1:53:53] mirror.
[1:53:55] We actually see who we really are, not
[1:53:58] who we fool ourselves that we are.
[1:54:01] We see our weaknesses. We see our faults
[1:54:04] and failures. We know that we want
[1:54:06] [music] more
[1:54:08] of God's life. But how to like Paul,
[1:54:12] when I would do good, evil is present.
[1:54:14] How to perform it? Paul said, I thank
[1:54:17] God through Jesus Christ. Lord, let
[1:54:19] [music] everyone be encouraged today who
[1:54:22] wants that that greater life, that holy
[1:54:24] life, more of [music] you. Whatever
[1:54:26] journey, wherever they're at on their
[1:54:28] journey, Lord,
[1:54:30] whether they're working out their own
[1:54:32] salvation [music] with fear and
[1:54:33] trembling
[1:54:34] before they are born again in the spirit
[1:54:36] of God, or whether [music] they're
[1:54:38] working out their continuing to work out
[1:54:40] their salvation with fear and trembling
[1:54:42] on the other side of the Holy Ghost, I
[1:54:45] pray you will give them fresh courage
[1:54:46] today, [music] Lord. Give them fresh
[1:54:49] courage and a fresh determination to
[1:54:52] press forward and free themselves from
[1:54:55] the grip of the enemy by the power of
[1:54:57] the Holy Spirit. It's not about human
[1:54:59] will, Lord. It's not gritted teeth. It's
[1:55:01] not that. It's all about surrender. May
[1:55:04] there be a fresh surrender. I raise up
[1:55:07] my hands, Lord. Let there be a fresh
[1:55:09] surrender right here [music]
[1:55:11] in 2026. Lord, let there be a fresh
[1:55:14] surrender right here at the beginning of
[1:55:15] the of the year. I pray you'll grant it
[1:55:18] to us in Jesus name. That holy life.
[1:55:23] Amen. I want that holy
[1:55:27] [singing and music] life. I want that
[1:55:30] holy way. I want to be [music] free from
[1:55:35] [singing] strife and do what Jesus said.
[1:55:39] [music]
[1:55:40] I want that [singing] holy
[1:55:45] [music] life. I want that [singing] holy
[1:55:49] life. I want [music] that holy way. I

[1:55:58] [music] what Jesus said.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saint.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; I want that holy [singing]
[1:56:03] God bless you to be dismissed. Give me
[1:56:05] that other life. [music]
[1:56:07] I want [singing] that holy life. I want
[1:56:12] that [music] holy [singing]
[1:56:14] way.

[1:56:40] Christ to take complete
[1:56:44] control.

[1:56:53] I have a vision,
[1:56:56] a vision in my view. [music]
[1:57:01] I'm pressing my way,
[1:57:04] trying to make it through.
[1:57:08] There's [music] a merry supper that's
[1:57:11] been called by the lamb.
[1:57:16] [music] I'm going to be there. I'm going
[1:57:19] to be there. Yes, I am. I want that holy
[1:57:25] [music] life. I want that holy [singing]
[1:57:29] way. I want to be free from [music]
[1:57:33] strife and do what Jesus said.
[1:57:38] I [music] want that home. [singing]
[1:57:44] I [music] want that holy [singing]
[1:57:47] life. I want that holy way. I want to be
[1:57:53] [music] free from strife and do what
[1:57:57] Jesus
[1:57:59] said.
[1:58:00] [music] I want that holy
[1:58:05] life. I want that holy [music]
