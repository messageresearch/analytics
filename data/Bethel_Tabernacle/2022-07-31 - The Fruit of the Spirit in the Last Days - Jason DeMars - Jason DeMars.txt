========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm going to be speaking this time on the fruit of the spirit in the bride tree ephesians 4 13 till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ let's pray heavenly father we come before you now lord and we ask that your holy spirit would come and anoint your word lord and speak it forth to the hearts of your people we ask that you'd be glorified lord that that your name would be lifted up help us to step out of the way lord each one uh let the the worries and the cares of this life slip aside and and let your thoughts of you and of your word and of your glory come and take that place father we ask these things in jesus name amen bless you can be seated so here we see in ephesians 4 13 and we'll be talking more either later or next time about this scripture but this is a prophecy of the end time and the condition of that that god is going to bring in the end time church the truth the true church you know we understand there's a true true church and there's a false church there's a true vine and a false fine and so you know that's you look at at the seven churches in asia each one they have a rebuke and they have those who overcome right alongside each other and so it's clear from scripture jesus says the kingdom of heaven is like and unto and he goes and tells parables and he shows there is a true seed church and there's a false seed church there's there's the seed that was planted by the son of man and there's a seed that is sown by the devil the children of the kingdom and the children of the devil and it's both in the kingdom of heaven that kingdom of heaven is not up in the sky kingdom of heaven is the church kingdom heaven is in kingdom is in our midst is in the midst of us so there's a true seed and a false seed right and so in the true seed we see this in in the book of revelation in laodicean church age there's no commendation there's no nothing positive it just speaks of the overcomer right it's it's the worst age it's the darkest age we speak of the dark age and they got they got nothing on us in this age yes it was the dark age yes there was very little light on the word but today it's so deceiving it's the most deceitful age because satan impersonates himself as the church and so you see the church operating in the world today and what is it it's an impersonation you know we say well i know good people there okay it's this i do too it's nothing about that at all but it's about how satan is working in this staged age to deceive good people the primary place that he's working and using to deceive is america and it's through it's clear it's through american politics and it's it's the way that you see the charismatic and the baptist and all the churches you know you look at if you look in the grand scheme of things all the denominational churches today how many of them actually believe the bible is inspired hundred percent it's inspired of god it's it's getting to the place where very few you see the charismatic believe that assemblies of god united pentecostal believe that some baptist churches believe that but even now the southern southern southern baptist group they're they're now deciding to say well let's let women preachers in that's always the first step look at the other mainline denominations lutheran methodist each of them their first step at falling well before women preachers was the the the lack of holiness amongst the sisters because the church always if you look at the condition of the sisters in the church the women in the church that's going to be the condition of the church so if if you watch each of these denominational programs they were dead when they denominated but then they went through a process of cascading into total liberalism you know and and you see the the lutheran church the presbyterian the methodists the episcopalian these different denominations and this the first doctrinal step that they make is women can be in the pulpit then the next thing is uh is homosexuality really all that bad they're nice people it's okay and so this whole process of descending into not accepting the bible as the absolute as your final authority now accepting logic reason and every other thing besides basically culture becomes your absolute in these churches this is the process that's happening that's over there then you go over here into the churches that believe the bible and what do you see in america they're all under the influence of politics all their leaders franklin graham and and um all of them what are they what are they leaning towards what are they what is their hope in some great politician coming and restoring america to something great i'm talking about the condition of the false church and why it's the false church message believers shouldn't be deceived into this political movement it's not it's a political movement connected to church what was the problem at nicaea and before nicaea it was the connection of the church into politics what's the problem in our day with the pentecostals and the charismatics their connection into politics they're deceived they're deceived their message is from satan satan impersonating himself through the church good people nice people maybe even many of the preachers had started out with a good motivation now they got 20 000 members and their budget is 35 million dollars a year and you know money's just money but it's what what's in your heart and what's your attitude all these church they take they they spend 15 minutes preaching uh about tithing and offerings every service and they take their offering if it's not enough maybe sometimes they'll take another one didn't meet our budget we need a million every week and so it's insa it's insanity and we look and say my could the message is the message true people are wondering if the message is true goodness sakes what are you looking at out there how blind and deceived can you be yes there's problems amongst the message movement absolutely but look at the bible and look at the messenger and what message he brought don't look at the message movement there's lots of problems there's been there's been lots of problems there's been cults clans all these things but what are we looking at is the true church the true bride of christ that follows every word in this bible don't be afraid of the bible the people are afraid of it they say they don't their creed says they're not afraid of it but they are because when they're confronted with it they don't know what to do and they say it don't matter anymore suddenly it matters on your creed but now when you're confronted with the word what the word actually says oh no that don't matter we're all christians we're just all believers see that ecumenical spirit when confronted with the word you can't say amen he says we're all christians we're all one oh okay we see where we're going but to the true elected bride this is the promise till we all come in the unity of the faith you say how's it going to come not by the works of man not by the works of the flesh not by us organizing ourselves together each of us as individuals being faithful to the one that's called us and letting him work out the details he will work out the details because he promised that he would do it anything else when whenever we try to work out the details of this unity that becomes an ecumenical spirit and you've denominated no it's about you being faithful to christ regardless what anybody else does around you then you'll be unified with real believers till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man so a completed mature man under the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ this is what the true church is going to come to the true bride of christ is going to come to before the rapture takes place and god has sent a message and that's what he's doing in us you say i don't see it i don't feel it shut up devil i'm not talking to you talking to that devil that's talking to you but the circumstances around the message it couldn't be shut up devil i'm not talking to you we don't want to hear that nonsense get behind me satan this is a prophecy of the word of god and every word will come to pass not on the way we organize ourselves together but on the way we surrender to him and let him have his way the prophet says and anointed ones at the end times to see the fruit of the spirit in the last days and the bride tree ripening in the top of the time i believe that's an exact answer to this scripture there's going to be a ripening that's that's a maturing getting to the place where we're ready to be picked right we're not talking about ripening in the warehouse the lord wants tree-ripened fruit the real deal genuine not using gases and lights and so forth but the real genuine ripening that comes from being on a tree and then he's going to harvest harvest us take us in the rapture but we've received the word today that's going to ripen us it's all the message we don't need to add to it but we need to follow what's are in it not what we think's in it but it's actually there all right so let's look at the fruit of the spirit and of course we understand as we we go along this and we'll look at some quotes the fruit of the spirit is not the evidence of receiving the holy ghost it can be mimicked but it's the fruit of the spirit in other words if you have the holy ghost it will produce this but you can also mimic these things using human characteristics the prophet clearly clearly says that we're not to get this out of order and say well i have the fruit of the spirit therefore i have the spirit no no we receive the word and then that word lives in us and produces the fruit of the spirit you see that fine line it's important not to get it out of the way if you get it out of the way you know brother branham says i learned it wasn't love i learned it wasn't the fruits that was the evidence it wasn't tongues but it was receiving the word for your age and then immediately any time he says that he says immediately says and then that word lives in you so it's not as though he's saying well it's just receiving the word and you can be any kind of rotten person no it's just it's just getting in its right proper position receiving the word for your age is what br is what is the evidence of the holy ghost but when you do that it produces something in your life the same works that christ did amen this i say then galatians 5 16 this i say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh so this is this is paul speaking to the galatians and the galatians main trouble is they received the gospel they received the holy spirit by faith by by the hearing of the word is what the apostle says they heard that word preached they believed it and the holy spirit fell upon them just just like cornelius did while peter was yet speaking the holy spirit fell fell on them so paul's saying okay you you start you started out you received it right now false teachers came and you listened and you thought okay i need to have the law i need to follow the law you got it out of order walk in the spirit and you won't fulfill the lusts of the flesh it's not the other way around if you don't fulfill the lust of the flesh then you're walking in the spirit no it's not how it works it's not just as brother we talked about with brother branham it's not have the fruit of the spirit and then you'll receive the word of your age it's received the word of your age then the fruit of the spirit will follow so the galatians have turned away from the simplicity of the word back to the law right so they looked at this as a grouping of rules regulations of course they were christians but they said they said you know what we need to be circumcised we need to follow these commandments in order to rece be heirs of the covenants of promise that's what the false teachers were bringing to them they weren't bringing they weren't saying don't believe the gospel no they were saying believe the gospel but first you have in order to believe the gospel and to receive these promises you have to follow the law you have to get circumcised you have to do this you have to do the list of rules now you're a message believer it's not following the list of rules and then you know you believe the word and then that word lives inside of you producing the the works it's it any any look at any false cults and clans many of them teach modesty right and and and things even beyond what we're doing i don't mean they have the fruit of the spirit they're just following a religion you can turn anything into a religion people have turned this message into a religion and they uses it as stick to beat people over the head with that's not what the message is it's received the word and when you receive that word that word lives right and it convicts you of sin and we preach against sin and that word meets the word and you come into obedience to it but it's not about controlling manipulating forcing that's what the that's what the false teachers to galatia we're bringing we're bringing outward obedience leads to covenant blessings that's not the new covenant it's not what paul preached that's false teaching isn't it amazing that's the same kind of thing had come into the message let's look at this quote from is your life worthy of the gospel when this takes place the thing you'll do then you'll find out that the spirit that comes into you from the new birth you will believe and do everything that god says in his word for is for you to do everything that the bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it with an amen amen and you'll not stop day and night until you receive it that's right that's right and in all this time you'll certainly above everything bear the fruit of the spirit amen you know paul writes and i i can't even recall where he writes it but he tells them i don't have any need to teach you about brotherly love for the spirit teaches you in other words these things come we bear this automatic now again again don't don't get it don't don't get super spiritual on me here understand that if you're a babe in christ you do things that a babe in christ does there's a process when i received the holy spirit i had so many bad habits in my life they didn't instantly drop off the desire changed and then little by little i overcome one step i overcome another step i overcome another step and the whole thing was the grace of god working in me to sanctify my life but this if i would have just done all those things without the holy spirit it's worthless it's meaningless the spirit of god came to me when i received the word in in the portion that i received it the spirit of god came to me and he cleansed started cleansing me i got rid of swearing i got rid of rap music i got rid of drinking step by step all these things fell off because it was god working in me no one was forcing me to do that no one was pushing me said you must do that even when i came eventually came to a message church and first services i came i was wearing shorts this is what i knew nobody said anything but i fed on the word and what happened we're feeding on the word immediately i listened to satan's eden i tell my friend let's pause that i throw out my shorts come back and finish listening no one told me to do that no one forced me to do that just listening to the word and i said amen i punctuated with an amen and i did it and so we don't have to force one another to obey the word we we want each one to receive the holy spirit of course as parents we teach we train we hold accountable not saying anything against that but understand is your kids are living under your influence that's different than living full of the holy ghost point them to christ and receiving christ in your heart by the baptism of the holy ghost then that word can truly live in them but train them teach them we we have to have training too you know my training come after i received the holy spirit i wish it would have come before a little bit came before it would have been an easier life for me easier things to recover myself from but god's grace is sufficient regardless of what it is amen so galatians 5 17 for the flesh lust against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would so paul is speaking again to born-again people he's not speaking to people who are unsaved speaking he's writing to the saints in galatia so this is you as a believer the flesh lusts against the spirit what is lust in this word means to set the heart upon so the flesh sets the heart against the spirit and the spirit sets the heart against the flesh right so the holy spirit in us will set our heart against the works of the flesh they're contrary to another the works of the spirit the fruit of the spirit is contrary to the works of the flesh they fight one another inside of us right you angels out there as the brother said the other night they we're not angels we're facing a battle inside of ourselves the flesh fighting against the spirit the spirit wants to work in our hearts so that from that control tower we're walking in obedience and submission to the word the flesh is warring against that and saying no no take the easy route take the easy way do the things that you want to do follow your dreams it's deceitful it's deceiving this two natures at war against us against each other inside of us that's why we're that's why we're our worst enemy is that that flesh that's warring against the spirit but what do we do we have to bring it under submission that's why paul said i die daily and he didn't literally go through death every day and get resurrected and then he woke up for the day no he he had to die to the flesh to the desires of the flesh that were lusting against the spirit that were setting his heart against the spirit and that sinful nature within us doesn't evaporate or vanish until we get a new body when we have that new body then it's gone then it's finished until then we have a war on our hands and that's what the christian walk is it's a war but if you be led of the spirit ye are not under the law well it depends on what your concept of being led of the spirit is there's a lot of real religious people that think being being led of the spirit is being under under the submission of a domineering pastor that's not being led to the spirit that's just being under nicolaitanism well there's a lot of people that being led of the spirit thinks i can just do anything i want to without checking with god about it now that's following your own wicked heart being led by the spirit anytime you're led by the spirit we know the leading will never contradict the word always lead according to the word that's why brother branham said if one when the angel of the lord comes to me uh i check it by the bible right he would hear he would listen then he would go from genesis to revelation to check it by the bible why because that's a that's an angel a spirit from god coming to speak to him and he knows it has to be by the word and then the people say if the angel of the lord told you brother branham that water baptism was acts 2 38 will do it so if the angel lord said anything else it wouldn't be an angel from god the angels everyone must be subject to the word being led by the spirit is not being led by emotions people are led by emotions they're they're one day they're going one direction the next day they're going another direction why because they're following their emotions and not the spirit the spirit leads you consistently sometimes it's strange it can be strange to those looking from the outside right that doesn't mean that doesn't mean it is it isn't come like that sometimes your leadings are strange but your leadings are always according to the word and it's an individual leading that individual leading will lead you to the unity of the faith right it's not going to make you an island to yourself and i don't go to church and i don't do this i stay home and listen to tapes i stay home and streaming no it brings you in unity of the faith not by a force but it's it's something that god is working in you to bring you into into communion in the holy ghost together with other believers and being led by the spirit is going to look like the fruit of the spirit is coming forth in your life love joy peace patience kindness goodness gentleness not the works of the flesh and so paul here is trying to emphasize to them in this is if you're being led by the holy ghost if you have if you've been if you receive the spirit of god in your life you've been changed you've been transformed you don't need to be under the law because that spirit in in you is going to bring you and write that word on your heart so that you live what the law says what the ten commandments say you're you become a written epistle of god because he's writing his word in your heart and then you obey the word what is the new covenant what is the new covenant it's not oh the law is thrown in the trash bin no it's he's taking that law and writing it on your heart right he's circumcising your heart it's not the spirit of god is not going to lead you contrary to the word it's going to lead you directly into obedience of the word our flesh we cannot keep the ten commandments the bible time and time again shows us the truth of that only thing that the ten commandments does to this flesh is put us in bondage and send us to hell but the holy spirit comes you know the law is just a school master right to lead us to christ it's to point us on the road what was intended paul says what was intended to bring life only brings death to us that's the law not because there's a problem with the law it's because there's a problem with us we have a sin we're born with a sinful nature and we always do the things that are displeasing to the lord but when you receive the holy ghost that brings it that brings a new desire and a new direction in your life and it leads you into obedience to the word not because you feel forced you feel like it's a duty no you feel like it's a a joy it's a delight to you you and you and you you love it it's diff many times it's difficult and we have to die to our flesh but really that inside on the inside man is rejoicing in in walking in obedience to the word all right let's close you'd stand heavenly father we're so thankful that we know that when the spirit of truth is come into our hearts you guide us into all truth lord and you show us the things that are to come lord and you give us ears to hear and eyes to see the invisible things lord that are hidden from the world lord and and out of that we become that living word that's your purpose not just to hear it though we draw rejoice over hearing it and we love hearing it but lord it's becoming it becoming a living epistle read and known of all men help us to be that lord cleanse our hearts and minds be glorified in us lord bless the worship lord may our hearts be centered upon you bless the preaching of the word may you be glorified we ask in jesus christ's name amen [Music] [Music] [Music] you
