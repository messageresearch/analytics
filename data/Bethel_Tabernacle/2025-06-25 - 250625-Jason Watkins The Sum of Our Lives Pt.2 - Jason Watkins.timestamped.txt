[27:21] We're going to go to Revelation 4:1.
[27:25] And uh we were looking last Wednesday
[27:27] and I by the help of the Lord, I want to
[27:29] continue on with it this evening in the
[27:32] sum of our lives part two. And um just
[27:36] some other I want to continue on. There
[27:37] are some things on my heart that I
[27:39] wanted to really bring out. And so, uh,
[27:42] let's catch our reading here in
[27:43] Revelation 4. Then we have a number of
[27:45] prayer requests. I already got maybe
[27:47] almost a half a dozen. So, if anyone has
[27:50] any, if you'll get them to me, just send
[27:52] them to me direct, email, text,
[27:54] WhatsApp, doesn't matter. I'll get them
[27:55] all right here before we go to prayer.
[27:58] Revelation 4 and verse one.
[28:05] After this, I looked, and behold, a door
[28:07] was opened in heaven. And the first
[28:10] voice which I heard was as it were, of a
[28:14] trumpet talking with me, which said,
[28:18] "Come up hither, and I will show thee
[28:20] things which must be hereafter."
[28:24] Let's pray. Master, we thank you for
[28:27] your word tonight. Father, we've read it
[28:30] and we've had this thought, Lord, on our
[28:33] mind throughout the day. just trying to
[28:36] uh decipher Lord with so much to say
[28:39] what exactly would you want said
[28:40] tonight. Now I'm convinced and feel
[28:43] convinced in my heart Lord that we have
[28:45] your perfect will. So we're going
[28:47] forward and I pray that your blessing
[28:49] would be upon both speaker and hearer.
[28:51] We commit it to you now and keep me
[28:54] focused Lord. You see that there's so
[28:56] much material my mind would easily go in
[28:59] multiple directions but I want to be
[29:01] concise and I want to be clear tonight.
[29:03] Lord, these are important matters and
[29:06] these are serious times, Lord. And we're
[29:08] asking for your help and your mercy
[29:10] tonight. We need you, Lord. We need to
[29:13] see you clearly in the word and what you
[29:15] would have us to know. So, I commit
[29:17] myself humbly before you in Jesus name.
[29:20] Amen. God bless you, friends. You can be
[29:22] seated.
[29:26] Praise the Lord.
[29:29] Brother Matt, you going to make it work?
[29:32] this microphone is okay. Thumbs up. Good
[29:34] deal. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[29:39] So,
[29:41] I want to just and I' I've been trying
[29:43] to figure out the best way to go forward
[29:46] uh looking at this verse. And I suppose
[29:49] I should probably
[29:52] u make mention uh where we were last
[29:55] time. We had read for you a number of
[29:59] quotes and there was no need to put them
[30:00] back up again tonight. We had five or
[30:02] six or so I think at least five. Uh 1,
[30:06] two, three, four, five. Well, we we had
[30:08] five and then we read a sixth one out of
[30:10] the church age book. Uh but we were
[30:14] finding where brother Brham uh talks
[30:17] about how that you know we are we are
[30:21] part of God's program. We are part of
[30:24] God's own life. We are part of God's
[30:27] body by a spiritual birth. And we are we
[30:31] found that we and I and I I I plan
[30:34] hopefully by Sunday. I've been promising
[30:36] you we're going to look at that name
[30:37] change with Abraham more closely and we
[30:39] plan to do that. I don't want to get
[30:41] into it tonight. It'll sidetrack me from
[30:43] my main thought. But but just remember
[30:46] and I said this to you Sunday and I want
[30:48] you to remember it although tonight is
[30:51] not part of that series but remember
[30:54] that that the one point I want you to
[30:57] constantly keep locked in your mind is
[30:59] that the Hebrew letter that was added to
[31:04] Abraham to Abram's name was actually the
[31:08] same one that use is used to describe
[31:12] God in Genesis when he created created.
[31:14] So, it's important for you to understand
[31:18] that God is adding um the aspect of
[31:22] creativeness or creative power or or
[31:25] something that God actually does. And
[31:27] that's an important point because
[31:30] everything we're reading tonight, I
[31:31] mean, if you're in God's family, God did
[31:33] that.
[31:35] If you're a believer tonight, God did
[31:36] that.
[31:37] Amen. If you've got a message of the
[31:39] hour that's going to give you rapturing
[31:41] faith, he did that. And so we realize
[31:44] that because that it's all based on
[31:47] election as brother Brandon would show
[31:48] us that that that redemption uh that
[31:52] that only the predestinated are
[31:55] considered in redemption. Now you know
[31:56] as well we've taught it many times
[31:59] redemption is next level salvation
[32:01] because many will find salvation. Many
[32:04] have found salvation from destruction.
[32:06] The unwise virgin are saved. They're not
[32:09] saved in the tribulation. They're
[32:11] already saved from destruction, but
[32:14] they're not converted. They're not born
[32:16] again, but they've had an experience of
[32:18] the Holy Ghost upon their spirit, and it
[32:21] has sanctified them. And that's why the
[32:24] king refers to them in Matthew 25 and
[32:26] and Matthew 7 and the book of
[32:29] Revelation. It calls them saints and it
[32:31] calls them righteous. And because it
[32:33] means that they are sanctified people.
[32:35] And so, so we realize that we we've
[32:38] showed you the difference between having
[32:40] your name uh in the book of life from
[32:43] the foundation of the world. Meaning
[32:44] that, you know, your name was put on
[32:46] there from the day you were born. But we
[32:49] know that the bride of Christ, that
[32:51] elect lady as John would call her, uh,
[32:54] with only three references in the entire
[32:57] Bible, that it references that there are
[33:00] some people whose names were on the
[33:03] lamb's book of life before the
[33:05] foundation of the world. And the and
[33:07] there's only three places you find that
[33:10] taught. And two of them refer to Jesus
[33:13] and one of them refers to the bride,
[33:16] his bride. And so we realize then that
[33:19] that God has a plan of salvation and
[33:23] then he has a plan of redemption.
[33:25] Salvation is included in that. But God
[33:28] is here redeeming his family. That's
[33:30] what's been happening for 2,000 years
[33:33] for seven church ages. It's why God sent
[33:35] messengers. That's why seals were
[33:37] partially opened. That's why messenger
[33:39] caught it, ran with it. That's why there
[33:41] were four living creatures to anoint it.
[33:43] Let me tell you something. God thought
[33:45] of everything.
[33:47] Amen.
[33:48] He knew what would happen to the world.
[33:50] He knew about the dark ages before it
[33:52] got dark. He knew our day would be gross
[33:55] darkness on the people. Darkness would
[33:56] cover the face of the earth. But he he's
[33:59] accounted for that. And I'm here to tell
[34:01] you that we are not left uh shortch
[34:04] changed. We're not left fending for
[34:06] ourselves. I want you to know that the
[34:09] same God who put you here planned for
[34:11] you to be here and has a plan and has
[34:14] redeemed you and he's done it. And we
[34:17] tonight are the happy recipients of that
[34:20] plan. I'm a beneficiary of everything
[34:23] that Calvary purchased. I'm happy to
[34:25] know that, friends. I'm happy to know
[34:28] that I'm my name is on the Lamb's book
[34:30] of life before the foundation of the
[34:32] world. I'm happy to know that I can't I
[34:34] can't disbelieve. It'd be impossible for
[34:37] me to disbelieve. It'd be impossible for
[34:39] me to stay away from God forever. The
[34:41] Holy Spirit came. The eagle screamed. I
[34:44] heard a voice. And something inside of
[34:46] me began to say, "Amen. Amen." And it
[34:50] brought me to repentance. And today I
[34:54] serve God because I have no desire to
[34:57] not serve him. I my whole makeup, my
[35:00] whole mindset, my whole world view is
[35:04] what can I do for the Lord? What while
[35:06] I'm here, what is my mission? And my I
[35:09] might have a job or career, get an
[35:11] education. I we have we pay bills and we
[35:14] take vacations. We raise families. We
[35:16] have the functions of living. We face
[35:17] the same problems the rest of the world
[35:19] faces. Thank God we've got the answers.
[35:22] Amen.
[35:22] Amen.
[35:23] Amen.
[35:23] And it's not that the world doesn't have
[35:25] the answers. It's that they don't
[35:27] believe them. Right?
[35:28] They've been offered. That's what the
[35:30] prophet said. You know, in almost
[35:31] exasperation, Lord, have they not heard?
[35:34] And immediately the inspiration strikes
[35:36] the prophet. Yay. Their sound went into
[35:39] all the earth. I'm here to tell you,
[35:41] nobody will be able to blame God on that
[35:45] day. He has he has left no stone
[35:49] unturned. He has in no way uh come up
[35:52] short of everything that was necessary
[35:54] for me to be a believer for me to be an
[35:57] overcomer.
[35:58] Amen.
[36:00] Now, he's not going to There's times
[36:02] say, "Well, I don't always feel like an
[36:04] overcomer." That's only because you
[36:05] fail.
[36:07] But I'm here to tell you that he's even
[36:08] accounted for that because we have an
[36:11] advocate. If we sin, we have an
[36:13] advocate, Christ Jesus.
[36:15] And if we and the Bible teaches us that
[36:18] if we will repent, he is faithful and
[36:21] just to forgive us. And I'm here to tell
[36:23] you, the Bible goes on to say that even
[36:26] if we are even if we are unfaithful, he
[36:29] remains faithful because he cannot deny
[36:32] himself.
[36:34] Which tells me that there's a part of
[36:36] God inside of me that has sealed the
[36:39] deal. and my whole life is trying now to
[36:42] cooperate in the vision that God had of
[36:44] me.
[36:46] We find out when we start to look at at
[36:48] redemption in the proper way as we were
[36:52] sons and daughters of God in God's
[36:55] godhead. Part of his uh mystery as a
[36:58] prophet told us we're it's it's actually
[37:00] he says so he reveals his church and
[37:04] raising it up by the same word. It's
[37:06] part of his three-fold mystery. So there
[37:09] the brother Brandham is not pulling
[37:11] punches now. He this is after the seals.
[37:15] He knows the time is short and he's not
[37:17] pulling punches. He's trying to get the
[37:19] bride secure in her position of who she
[37:23] is. Now,
[37:24] it's important to understand that
[37:26] because we one of the things that
[37:28] brother Brandham talks about as it
[37:30] relates to the Lord Jesus is because
[37:33] that that you and I came straight from
[37:36] the mind of God and we bypassed our
[37:39] theophony and we became straight to the
[37:41] flesh.
[37:42] Now, that's not how Jesus came because
[37:45] he was already theophony. That's that
[37:47] pillar of fire. That's the anointing
[37:49] that veiled the theophony god. He
[37:51] appeared in MelzDC. He appeared in in
[37:53] various places. So So this is why
[37:56] brother Brandon would say, "And because
[37:58] of that, he knowed all things."
[38:00] Right? Now, that's a curious thing to
[38:03] say because
[38:05] it it almost it almost sounds like that
[38:09] that that Jesus
[38:12] knew everything in his earthly
[38:15] pilgrimage
[38:16] and that he was he he was untemptable in
[38:21] any way, shape or form. But but actually
[38:24] I already know that both of those are
[38:27] not exactly
[38:29] accurate because we can find places.
[38:33] First of all, the Bible teaches us that
[38:35] he was tempted in all ways like in all
[38:38] ways as we are tempted.
[38:41] So we know that he also had to overcome.
[38:44] He had a human will that he had to say
[38:46] not my will thine be done.
[38:49] We know that when brother Brandon
[38:51] pointed these things out. I'm not taking
[38:52] the time to read the quotes, but they're
[38:54] all through the message. Brother
[38:55] Brandham talks about how that that Jesus
[38:59] didn't did not know everything.
[39:02] And and he says that and he says he says
[39:04] he did not know who touched him
[39:07] when the woman with an issue of blood
[39:08] reached and touched just his garment as
[39:10] he passed by. He did not know who did
[39:12] that. He stopped and turned around and
[39:14] asked the question, "Who touched me?"
[39:17] He didn't know who touched him. And and
[39:19] when we and when we find out that that
[39:22] they ask him on the Mount of Olives
[39:24] before he ascended, shall you now are
[39:26] you now going to restore the kingdom?
[39:28] And he says he says that the father
[39:30] alone knows that.
[39:32] And so he actually says that he did not
[39:35] know the answer to that.
[39:37] So So then when you say, "All right,
[39:40] well, what was it that him being a
[39:42] theophony ahead of being flesh caused
[39:45] him to know all things?" Here's what he
[39:48] knew and here's his advantage over you
[39:51] and I because we did not come through a
[39:53] theophony.
[39:55] So what he knew was that the Bible tells
[39:58] us in St. St. John 13 and then again I
[40:01] think it's in chapter 16. not going to
[40:03] try to turn and find it tonight, but you
[40:06] remember that when he's there in chapter
[40:08] 13 and it's the Lord's supper and you
[40:11] know the Bible says Jesus knowing
[40:14] knowing that all things were given to
[40:16] him of God all things he goes on to say
[40:19] later three chapters later that Jesus
[40:22] knowing that he came from God and that
[40:24] he went to God. So what he knew was that
[40:28] he came from God. He went back to God.
[40:31] He knew who he was. Brother Brandon
[40:33] would say, "In Is Your Life worthy of
[40:35] the gospel, Jesus never screamed at
[40:37] devils."
[40:38] Amen.
[40:40] Because he didn't have to. Here's why.
[40:42] Because he knew who he was.
[40:44] He knew. Here's what else he knew. He
[40:47] didn't know who touched him when the
[40:49] woman touched him. He didn't know the
[40:50] day of the coming of the Lord before he
[40:53] got that revelation when he ascended.
[40:55] But what he what but what he did know is
[40:57] that he came from God.
[40:58] Yes.
[40:59] Amen.
[41:00] He did know that that that God was in
[41:03] control of everything.
[41:04] He did know that he would return back to
[41:07] God.
[41:08] He knew that all things were given into
[41:09] his hands.
[41:11] He knew that. Brother Ram said he knew
[41:13] his words couldn't fail because he knew
[41:17] who he was. Amen.
[41:19] So now him having come through
[41:21] theophony, he had a revelation of who he
[41:24] was. He had a revelation that he came
[41:27] from God. He had a revelation of why he
[41:29] was here. There were things his humanity
[41:32] didn't know. But but the divine part of
[41:35] God knew that he come from God and went
[41:38] to God. And when he was in the
[41:40] wilderness fighting the devil, he didn't
[41:43] use his power. He used the word.
[41:47] See? And so now when it comes to you and
[41:49] I, you say, "But I wasn't theophony and
[41:52] then came to flesh." So I don't have
[41:54] that advantage. And that's exactly
[41:55] right. And that's exactly why a prophet
[41:58] would say that there is nothing so
[42:00] powerful as revelation. That when the
[42:03] bride knows who she is. Oh, hallelujah.
[42:06] That's when you are an invincible army.
[42:08] So God sends a messenger with a message
[42:12] to tell you you who you are that you
[42:15] were in Christ before the foundation of
[42:17] the world that you are part of God's uh
[42:20] part of God's three-fold mystery that
[42:23] you are that you are in God's godhead
[42:27] because you you don't have the advantage
[42:29] of knowing that but now you know it.
[42:31] Amen.
[42:32] Amen.
[42:33] And it is they say knowledge is power.
[42:36] It is that knowledge that that God has
[42:40] elected me before the foundation of the
[42:42] world.
[42:43] That I came from God. I'm going back to
[42:45] God. And there are not enough devils in
[42:48] all of hell to stop it. They cannot stop
[42:51] it. Even I can't stop it. You can't stop
[42:54] it. You can't you can't kick you out
[42:57] because you didn't put you in.
[42:59] Hallelujah. You came from God and are
[43:02] going back to God. So now the question
[43:04] becomes that my beginning and my ending
[43:09] being one in the same cuz I'm an eternal
[43:12] creature.
[43:14] Then what what is my life about then
[43:19] while I'm here in my mortal existence?
[43:22] Right. Amen.
[43:23] Good question.
[43:24] Amen. So when we began to look down last
[43:29] Wednesday through the various things, we
[43:32] came and we found out that here was one
[43:34] of the last things that we found out
[43:36] that that the bride, the body must
[43:40] follow the head
[43:42] as Christ resurrected. You know, that's
[43:44] why Paul would say if if he didn't
[43:47] resurrect,
[43:49] then we're finished. Yeah.
[43:52] If there's no resurrection, then you're
[43:54] still in your sin
[43:56] and you have you're right back to where
[43:57] you started. You're born in sin with no
[44:00] hope of changing it. I'm glad he
[44:02] resurrected. And he said, "Because I
[44:05] live, you live also." Not you might, not
[44:08] you possibly, but you live. I live, you
[44:11] live. See? And so, so we realized then
[44:14] that that these that these imply certain
[44:17] things to our lives. And that here was
[44:20] here was something that I that I didn't
[44:22] get I ran out of time last Wednesday
[44:24] that I wanted to go deeper into. And
[44:27] that is that that if the if the body is
[44:32] part of the head and the head is part of
[44:34] the body in so much so that because he
[44:36] rose, you'll raise.
[44:38] Amen.
[44:39] Amen.
[44:40] Then that means that I'm not here uh my
[44:44] life here as a Christian is not just an
[44:47] imitation of him.
[44:51] See, so it's not about copying Jesus,
[44:55] but it's about it's about being
[44:59] spiritually
[45:00] united your person with his person.
[45:04] See? And so, so, so then that that means
[45:07] in no uncertain terms that his
[45:11] resurrection was my resurrection.
[45:14] Amen.
[45:15] So, so then I, so then if and if and if
[45:19] that's true, and it has to be,
[45:22] then if that being the case, then I
[45:25] should be able to walk in resurrection
[45:28] power because the resurrection is not
[45:30] just a concept. The resurrection
[45:32] happened. There was a dead man and power
[45:36] came upon him and raised him back to
[45:38] life. If that same power that raised
[45:41] Jesus, if it be in you, shall also
[45:43] quicken your mortal body,
[45:46] then why should it not have resurrection
[45:48] power on me daily as I walk around? I'm
[45:51] here to tell you something. If your
[45:53] Christianity is only an imitation of
[45:55] Christ, you're not going to realize a
[45:57] whole lot of power. You're going to be
[45:59] part of those who admire the fine
[46:00] qualities of Jesus. and you get a little
[46:02] bit like him, but that's not the same
[46:04] thing as being invisibly united with the
[46:08] mind of Christ. His mind is my mind. His
[46:11] heart is my heart. I'm life of his life,
[46:14] flesh of his flesh, blood of his blood.
[46:17] That's why a prophet had the boldness to
[46:19] say like no one else I'd ever heard say,
[46:22] "You are the blood of God by the
[46:25] spirit."
[46:26] Amen.
[46:27] That's heavy.
[46:29] Amen. I promise you Larkin didn't say
[46:32] that.
[46:36] So then
[46:38] that being the case, now you're with me
[46:40] so far and you're shouting with me so
[46:42] far.
[46:44] But I wonder then if we realize that
[46:46] that being the case, then his
[46:49] sacrificial obedience should be mine
[46:53] as well.
[46:54] Amen. that as the body, as the body,
[46:58] surely you would agree with me tonight
[47:02] that as the body, you don't set the
[47:04] agenda.
[47:06] Amen.
[47:06] The head sets the agenda.
[47:08] Amen.
[47:08] See, so so then where where's your life
[47:12] going? Who's who's calling the shots? I
[47:15] hope it's not you.
[47:18] Oh, I I long ago stopped trying to call
[47:21] my own shots. I just say, "Lord God,
[47:22] every day, every morning, every moment,
[47:26] uh, lead me, guide me, show me your
[47:29] will, show me your way, and give me that
[47:32] the power of resurrection." Say, "Oh, if
[47:34] I just had the power of resurrection,
[47:35] man, I'd speak to storms. I'd walk on
[47:37] water." How about you just have the
[47:39] sacrifice of obedience?
[47:44] I'd rather walk on on the heads of
[47:46] devils than walk on water anyway.
[47:49] [Music]
[47:51] I'll take that any day.
[47:53] Walking on water ain't going to do one
[47:55] thing for me other than amaze people.
[47:57] I'm not saying it's not a great thing,
[47:59] but I'd rather have the devil under my
[48:01] feet
[48:02] than water under my feet.
[48:04] Hallelujah.
[48:06] So, our daily movements then should be
[48:09] in sync with his leadership. I believe
[48:12] that with all my heart because because
[48:16] that you're not an individual anymore.
[48:20] You're part of a body.
[48:22] Yeah.
[48:24] That's got to be more than a cliche.
[48:26] Amen.
[48:27] That's got to be more than just a
[48:29] saying. That's got to be more than just
[48:30] a message lingo. You know, I it it's got
[48:34] to mean something. I'm I'm not my own. I
[48:37] haven't been in a long time. I'm part of
[48:40] him. I mean, come on, friends. If we're
[48:42] going to rejoice that we're in his
[48:44] trinity, if we're in his godhead, if
[48:46] we're part of his life, then I ought to
[48:48] be able to say, then he's the head. I'm
[48:51] the body. He's the leader. I'm the
[48:52] follower.
[48:55] See,
[48:56] so it means that there should be unity.
[48:58] It means there should be humility. It
[49:00] means that there should be a
[49:02] connectedness. In fact, as I would say
[49:04] that that connectedness is so essential
[49:07] that it is that it that that if the
[49:09] devil can tamper with that say how might
[49:12] he tamper it? He's got how he tamper
[49:14] with he's got a hundred ways from
[49:15] Sunday. He'll fill up your schedule so
[49:17] you don't have time to pray. He'll he'll
[49:19] he'll knock on your door with all kinds
[49:21] of opportunities and all it is is taking
[49:24] you further away from dedication and
[49:26] consecration. Do you think Jesus
[49:29] couldn't have had the most powerful
[49:30] ministry? You think brother Brandham
[49:31] couldn't have had it? They they told
[49:33] him, "You you you've got the greatest
[49:35] ministry. We'll give you a jet. We'll
[49:37] give you a salary. We'll fly you all
[49:38] over the around the world." Oh, what
[49:40] would I have to do? Well, just a little
[49:42] compromise.
[49:44] Just, you know, just, you know, kind of
[49:45] leave off saying this, that, and the
[49:47] other. Oh, I'm so glad that we had a
[49:50] prophet who was faithful, who was part
[49:53] of the body, who was part of the head,
[49:54] who was following the headship and not
[49:56] following. He long ago, I'm going tell
[49:58] you something, friends. If he had have
[50:00] been choosing his own path, he would
[50:01] have took that $1,500,000
[50:04] check.
[50:04] Right. Right.
[50:06] But he wouldn't even look at it. Said,
[50:07] "I don't even want to look at it. Take
[50:09] it back to the man.
[50:10] The gospel is not for sale. I'm not for
[50:13] sale.
[50:14] Oh, I want to be able to say that. I
[50:16] want the devil to hear it. I am not for
[50:18] sale. You cannot take me aside from the
[50:22] will of God by offering me anything. I'm
[50:25] I've abandoned this world. I I put my
[50:28] eyes I've turned northward. I'm looking
[50:31] to Christ.
[50:33] Amen.
[50:34] It means that he's the gate. He's the
[50:36] doorway. In him dwells all the fullness
[50:39] of the godhead bodily. This is why I
[50:41] read
[50:43] uh Revelation 4:1
[50:47] because when we when we look at it,
[50:50] you know, uh uh hey Z, is that you
[50:53] sweetie? Give me uh Luke 17:37,
[50:57] honey. Give me Luke 17:37. I want to
[51:00] look at it real quick. We're always
[51:02] jumping to Luke uh 17:30, but let's read
[51:05] on past it a little bit. Um start at
[51:07] verse 30, sweetheart. We're going to
[51:09] start right there. Verse 30. Luke 17:30.
[51:14] Even thus shall it be in the day when
[51:17] the Son of Man is revealed.
[51:19] In that day, he which shall be upon the
[51:23] housetop, and his stuff in the house,
[51:25] let him not come down to take it away.
[51:27] And he that is in the field, let him
[51:29] likewise not return back. Remember Lot's
[51:32] wife. Whosoever shall seek to save his
[51:35] life shall lose it, and whosoever shall
[51:38] lose his life shall preserve it.
[51:41] Amen.
[51:42] Amen. I noticed that one's not running.
[51:44] I guess it's not turned on, but okay,
[51:45] you got it right here. Verse 34.
[51:48] I tell you, in that night there shall be
[51:51] two men in one bed. The one shall be
[51:53] taken and the other shall be left. Two
[51:55] women shall be grinding together, the
[51:57] one shall be taken and the other left.
[51:59] Two men shall be in the field, the one
[52:01] taken and the other left. This just
[52:03] simply means the world's going to be
[52:05] covered in humanity. All with very
[52:07] similar lives, all working. Some are
[52:09] sleeping, some are working, some are uh
[52:12] in the field, some are in the mill, some
[52:13] are the the world is going to be covered
[52:16] over. Uh, and when the bride is taken,
[52:19] it's going to be right in the middle of
[52:20] life as usual. And when the bride is
[52:23] taken, life will keep going life as
[52:26] usual.
[52:27] Now, it's going to get progressively
[52:29] harder because the tribulation's going
[52:30] to start in. And it's a day like has
[52:33] never been. But but he's making the
[52:35] point, I'm going to take one and I'm
[52:37] going to leave one. Verse 37. And they
[52:39] answered and said unto him, where, Lord?
[52:43] Where? So there's going to be two here.
[52:46] I'm going to take one and leave one. Two
[52:47] over here. It's just a metaphor. I'm
[52:49] going to take one and leave one.
[52:51] Thousands here. I'll take a handful over
[52:53] here. See? And I'm going to take them.
[52:57] And they said unto him, "Where, Lord?"
[53:00] And he said unto them, listen to this
[53:02] curious answer. "Wheroever the body is,
[53:06] thither will the eagles be gathered
[53:08] together."
[53:08] Amen.
[53:11] Huh? I I I thought you were talking
[53:14] about the rapture.
[53:16] See, when we read chapter 4, we realize
[53:21] that the bride has already went in a
[53:24] rapture at the end of chapter 3 because
[53:26] she goes in the rapture at the end of of
[53:28] chapter 3 at the end of the Leodysian
[53:30] church age.
[53:31] But chapter four and chapter five begin
[53:34] to describe, as brother Brandham said,
[53:36] it's not an eighth age.
[53:38] It's describing how he pulled off what
[53:41] he pulled off in the first three
[53:42] chapters.
[53:43] This is how he did it. And there was a
[53:46] throne and one sat on the throne and in
[53:47] his hand was a book sealed. And then at
[53:50] the end time the lamb comes forward the
[53:52] line of the tribe of Judah. He's a lamb
[53:54] slain. He takes the book loose the seals
[53:56] gives it to his messenger who then gives
[53:58] it to the people. And then that then
[54:00] that people become the final voice to
[54:01] the final before they're taken from the
[54:03] earth. See? So, so we've we've showed
[54:06] you many times you can't read the book
[54:08] of Revelation linearly like a newspaper
[54:10] because you know sometimes you'll read
[54:13] this part that in time sequence happened
[54:15] over here and this part here happened
[54:18] way over here until that intervenes and
[54:20] happened just ahead of that and then it
[54:21] it go and that's the way that's why it
[54:23] took a prophet to decipher it all.
[54:25] Amen.
[54:26] So when we when we begin to look at
[54:29] where there there there's really there
[54:32] there would really be no need to ask
[54:35] where you know some moved and some
[54:39] didn't move. And he's referring to a
[54:42] carcass. Where where are they going to
[54:45] gather? You're taking some, you're
[54:46] leaving some. Where are the ones who are
[54:49] not leaving? Where do they go? Not to
[54:52] the carcass.
[54:54] Right? So where are the ones that go
[54:57] that you're taking to the carcass?
[54:59] What's the carcass? The word of God.
[55:02] So we find that that God sends a word in
[55:07] this hour. That's a rapture message. And
[55:10] if you plan to go in the physical
[55:13] rapture, you're first going to have
[55:15] that's what Luke 17 is all about. as it
[55:17] was in the days of the son of man.
[55:19] There's going to be a word carcass and
[55:21] you're going to have to go to that
[55:23] carcass and feed upon that if you want
[55:26] to have the body change.
[55:28] Amen.
[55:30] Does it make sense?
[55:32] So that becomes the question, where will
[55:34] the ones where will the ones taken uh
[55:37] where will they be taken to? They'll be
[55:39] taken to the word. So, so the answer
[55:44] then becomes that's why we read it in
[55:47] the day of the son of man as verse 30
[55:49] had said they are taken to the opening
[55:52] of the word and that's what chapter 4 is
[55:56] chapter 4 and chapter 5 are the opening
[55:59] of the word it's a door the door is
[56:02] Christ amen hallelujah
[56:04] and God is going to begin to restore
[56:07] back the deity of Jesus Christ had been
[56:09] lost down through the ages But it's
[56:12] going to come at the very end of Leodysa
[56:14] in that blending time or end of
[56:16] Philadelphia in that blending time where
[56:18] it starts to move into the Leodysian age
[56:21] and and and and it's a it's beginning to
[56:23] be a a burgeoning revelation of the
[56:25] deity of Jesus Christ. And that would
[56:28] and that you know the oneness thought we
[56:30] got it, we got it. And Isuza said we got
[56:32] it, we got it. And they didn't realize
[56:35] that that that was happening to
[56:38] establish the deity of Jesus Christ. But
[56:41] under the opening of the seals, it would
[56:43] also reveal, Mrs. Jesus Christ. And we
[56:47] would find out in a mind-blowing way, oh
[56:49] my goodness, I've always been a part of
[56:52] him and I'm a part of him now. And
[56:54] that's why I'm a believer. So then, why
[56:56] would not my life be an invisible union
[56:59] with the son of God? Why would my life
[57:02] not be a life of sacrifice and obedience
[57:04] to God? Amen.
[57:07] Why would I not uh deny myself the
[57:10] world? So that I might pursue the Lord.
[57:15] See, so they are gathered to the carcass
[57:17] of the word.
[57:19] So, and and and and that's so beautiful
[57:22] because
[57:24] my goodness, when you go from from
[57:27] Revelation 4 all the way to Revelation
[57:29] 10, you know, you don't see the devil or
[57:32] his kingdom members, you you find a a a
[57:34] a sea of glass as clear as crystal.
[57:38] There's Brother Brandon points that out.
[57:40] There's no fire in it, no fire and blood
[57:43] because it's clear as crystal means
[57:44] there's no judgment.
[57:47] There's no judgment. When they were
[57:49] standing there on the sea of glass,
[57:52] Brother Brandon went back to it again
[57:53] and again and again. It's clear. Your
[57:56] future's clear. You're standing there to
[57:58] receive the word. You're clear.
[58:01] There's no judgment. You've already
[58:02] moved above the judgment. Hallelujah.
[58:05] And the world is falling apart. But
[58:07] because the head ascended, the body
[58:09] ascends. I'm not just believing fancy
[58:12] doctrine or or high altitude teaching. I
[58:15] become in union with almighty God and my
[58:18] life is something that can't even be
[58:20] explained.
[58:21] Amen.
[58:22] Amen.
[58:23] All we can say is I know him and the
[58:26] power of his resurrection.
[58:28] Say what does that mean? It means that
[58:30] whatever he wants out of my life, you
[58:32] got it Lord. Here it is. Whatever use
[58:35] you can get out of it, take me, mold me,
[58:38] use me. Whatever is hindering you,
[58:40] remove it.
[58:42] Amen. say, "What if it cost you
[58:44] something?" I I I don't even need to
[58:46] know what it is. I don't even care. Just
[58:49] take it. Whatever is hindering me, take
[58:52] it from me.
[58:54] See,
[58:55] so you know, I I remember some years a
[58:58] uh probably a year or two ago, and
[59:00] brother JD made that statement. I wrote
[59:02] it here in my notes in my in my made it
[59:04] part of my permanent Bible notes that
[59:06] Brother Jason said it like this. We have
[59:08] to go here. Here's where your mindset
[59:11] needs to be, friends. We have to go from
[59:15] the mindset of waiting on the rapture to
[59:18] living in the experience of it.
[59:22] Amen.
[59:22] The rapture is not some pie in the sky
[59:25] way off at the a golden pot at the end
[59:28] of a rainbow. It's now.
[59:30] The rapture is now. I'm part of it.
[59:33] Jesus said, "I am the resurrection. If
[59:35] he is, then I am."
[59:37] Hallelujah. And I'm trying to live in
[59:39] the experience of it. I'm not waiting to
[59:41] have an experience. I'm having an
[59:44] experience.
[59:46] See? Oh, it's so beautiful when you put
[59:49] it all together.
[59:50] So, we find then that
[59:53] that he's the gate, he's the door, he's
[59:55] the way.
[59:58] As a prophet said, in him dwells, the
[1:00:00] Bible says, in him dwells the fullness
[1:00:02] of the godhead. Amen.
[1:00:05] So then that means I mean this is the
[1:00:08] sum of our lives. That's what I'm
[1:00:10] preaching on, the sum of our lives.
[1:00:14] So then if he's the gate and he's the
[1:00:17] door and I've been called into it
[1:00:20] and he's the way and in him dwells the
[1:00:23] fullness of the godhead bodily. Then to
[1:00:26] me when I think about what how does that
[1:00:28] what are the implications for my daily
[1:00:32] now come on because here's what I've
[1:00:33] been stressing to you it it's it's not
[1:00:36] about uh edge of the atmosphere
[1:00:39] theology
[1:00:41] we got loads of that
[1:00:42] but it's what are the daily implications
[1:00:46] my my title is the sum of our lives
[1:00:50] what are the daily implications oh I'm
[1:00:53] here to tell you something friends it we
[1:00:55] say, "Oh, well, there's worship in my
[1:00:57] life." It's not just you can worship
[1:00:59] anything, but is it Christ centered
[1:01:02] worship?
[1:01:04] See, because people, Brother said, you
[1:01:06] worship your car, you worship your wife,
[1:01:08] you worship your family, you worship
[1:01:09] your job, you worship money. You're
[1:01:12] going, you're a creature made in the
[1:01:14] image of God. You're going to worship
[1:01:16] something. That's right.
[1:01:17] You're the only animal of all the
[1:01:20] animals starting at the lowest to the
[1:01:23] highest till it finally achieved a human
[1:01:26] something in the image of God's
[1:01:27] expression. And you're the you're you're
[1:01:30] the only living creature that prays.
[1:01:34] Amen.
[1:01:34] No other animal prays. You're the only
[1:01:37] living creature that worships.
[1:01:40] Other other animals below us, they don't
[1:01:43] worship. You worship. You're in the
[1:01:45] image of God. So the question becomes
[1:01:48] not will I worship. Here's the question.
[1:01:50] What are you worshiping? Because you are
[1:01:52] going to worship something.
[1:01:55] Amen.
[1:01:56] And I want a Christ centered worship.
[1:01:58] Amen.
[1:01:59] I want all my spiritual access to be
[1:02:01] through him. And I do not want any
[1:02:04] alternative roads. I don't want any
[1:02:06] alternating pathways. I don't want to
[1:02:08] end around. I don't want shortcuts. I
[1:02:10] don't I want to be all about the word of
[1:02:13] God. I want my life to be a Christc
[1:02:15] centered worship and everything and
[1:02:17] every goal and every objective I have
[1:02:20] has him centered
[1:02:24] in the center of it.
[1:02:28] I believe friends that
[1:02:31] things like devotion,
[1:02:33] things like a prayer life, those things
[1:02:37] have to focus on Christ.
[1:02:39] They don't whatever you do, don't make
[1:02:41] it about religion.
[1:02:44] That is just a covering. You know, I I
[1:02:48] was saying to my wife the other day and
[1:02:50] I I played her news clip. I said,
[1:02:51] "Here's an interesting thing." And you
[1:02:54] know, our our president is he's he's
[1:02:57] thanking the military and the pilots and
[1:03:00] and you know, and the armed forces and
[1:03:02] he's thanking this one. And he says, and
[1:03:04] he says, "And I and I would like to
[1:03:06] thank," and he paused. You could tell it
[1:03:09] was very genuine. And he said, "I would
[1:03:12] like to thank God."
[1:03:15] And I want to say, "And and and and I
[1:03:18] heard go maybe because I'm a preacher
[1:03:20] and I I I have to fight through that.
[1:03:22] Sometimes you get so caught up in the
[1:03:24] emotion of what you're preaching that
[1:03:26] you can almost just start weeping." And
[1:03:28] I I detected when he said, "And we just
[1:03:31] want to say and I heard a break in his
[1:03:33] voice." And I've experienced that, "We
[1:03:35] love you, God.
[1:03:37] We love you
[1:03:38] and we thank you." And I just thought,
[1:03:40] "Wow, you can say nothing evil about
[1:03:43] that." The man was sincere.
[1:03:46] And then in in perfect
[1:03:48] contradistinction,
[1:03:50] the two days later, he's talking to the
[1:03:53] press and he's dropping the fbomb and
[1:03:55] he's cussing and vulgar language. And I
[1:03:58] thought, you know, he's he turns around
[1:04:02] and goes and gets on Marine One still
[1:04:04] believing that God is receiving his
[1:04:06] thanks and that he's actually a
[1:04:08] Christian and that he actually loves
[1:04:10] God. And and I'm not here. I'm not
[1:04:12] judging Donald Trump. I'm simply saying
[1:04:15] that's where Satan has got this world to
[1:04:18] that they all think they're Christians.
[1:04:20] They all think they're going to heaven.
[1:04:22] They all think and it doesn't even
[1:04:23] matter how they live. It doesn't matter
[1:04:25] what how they dress, what they look
[1:04:26] like, what they say, where they go, what
[1:04:27] they do. I'm here to tell you it
[1:04:29] matters.
[1:04:31] And and it's not something you do or
[1:04:33] something you put on. But when your life
[1:04:35] is centered on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:04:38] you cannot live in those ways of the
[1:04:41] world. It changes your dialect. It
[1:04:43] changes your attitude. It changes your
[1:04:46] world, your worldview. It changes your
[1:04:48] goals and your dreams and your plans.
[1:04:50] And Christ becomes the center. This is
[1:04:53] the sum of our lives.
[1:04:58] Hallelujah.
[1:04:59] It's not religion,
[1:05:00] certainly not tradition, and it's
[1:05:03] certainly not self-effort.
[1:05:06] Amen.
[1:05:10] If everything
[1:05:12] that God is,
[1:05:14] he poured into Christ and everything
[1:05:17] that Christ is, he has poured into his
[1:05:20] church, then there is no lacking.
[1:05:24] Amen.
[1:05:25] There is no lack. And I'm here to tell
[1:05:27] you something, friends. Fullness is
[1:05:31] available to you tonight.
[1:05:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:05:35] You don't have to live a life
[1:05:37] spiritually lacking.
[1:05:39] That is a miserable place.
[1:05:42] Oh, I'm here to tell you something,
[1:05:43] friends. I want to have the fullness of
[1:05:46] Christ. I want to have everything that
[1:05:48] I'm entitled to. I want to be able to
[1:05:51] walk with the authority of the word. I
[1:05:54] want to be able to have boldness when I
[1:05:56] pray. And I want to be able to have an
[1:05:58] expectation that when I say, "Father," a
[1:06:01] father responds. that when I lay my
[1:06:03] hands on the sick, the sick will
[1:06:05] recover. That when I that when I walk
[1:06:08] through a world of sin and I on purpose
[1:06:11] turn my head away and will not uh give
[1:06:14] way to the temptations of the world, I
[1:06:16] want to have an authority. I don't want
[1:06:18] to be fighting, you know, and just
[1:06:19] gritting my teeth. I want to have
[1:06:21] something that has conquered my will.
[1:06:27] Amen.
[1:06:28] You can have fullness. It's available.
[1:06:31] You're entitled to it.
[1:06:33] you're entitled to it. The the world has
[1:06:35] such a uh has made such a horrible
[1:06:38] mockery out of entitlement, thinking
[1:06:41] they're entitled to things they're not
[1:06:42] even entitled to at all. And and we just
[1:06:44] end up saying, "Oh, you're just you're
[1:06:45] just entitled." It's almost become a an
[1:06:48] an insulting thing. But I'm here to tell
[1:06:51] you something, friends. Uh I I if you if
[1:06:53] you want to feel entitled then feel this
[1:06:56] that you are entitled to walk in
[1:06:58] authority
[1:06:59] and you are entitled to walk in
[1:07:01] boldness. You are entitled you it is
[1:07:04] your divine right. You have a right to
[1:07:06] have a conference with God. You have a
[1:07:08] right to live in victory. You don't need
[1:07:10] anyone's permission. The Holy Ghost
[1:07:12] gives it to you and no one can take it
[1:07:14] from you.
[1:07:17] If we are part of God's family then I
[1:07:19] believe as brother Brandham said we
[1:07:20] should act like it.
[1:07:22] Amen.
[1:07:23] Because we're not trying to get in.
[1:07:27] You are sons and daughters of God.
[1:07:30] You're not you're not running a
[1:07:32] competition to see if you can get in.
[1:07:35] You're in.
[1:07:37] In fact is the beauty of of you being in
[1:07:40] is that you were really a 90 lb weakling
[1:07:42] who could have never even conquered you,
[1:07:45] much less eternal life. But you're in.
[1:07:48] Hallelujah.
[1:07:50] So it's walking worthy of these
[1:07:52] realities as brother Brandon would title
[1:07:54] it. Is your life worthy of the gospel?
[1:07:58] So to live worthy of these truths, I
[1:08:01] want you to ponder that for a moment
[1:08:03] because brother Brandham emphasized this
[1:08:05] so much. You know, he he told the story
[1:08:08] about the the African prince who had
[1:08:10] been captured and and even in slavery.
[1:08:12] He knew that he was still of a royal
[1:08:14] line. He knew that his father was a king
[1:08:16] and and though a prisoner, he conducted
[1:08:19] himself according to his original life.
[1:08:24] Amen.
[1:08:25] And so, brother Brandham says, you know,
[1:08:27] if that's the if that being the case in
[1:08:29] history, then ought we not if we say
[1:08:31] that we are children of the king, that
[1:08:33] we are we I say I'm not this world is
[1:08:36] not my home. I'm just passing through.
[1:08:38] My treasures are laid up somewhere
[1:08:40] beyond the blue. That ought to be that
[1:08:42] ought to be more than a song. That ought
[1:08:44] to be more than a little jingle or a
[1:08:46] rhyme that you whistle or hum. That
[1:08:48] ought to be a living reality of every
[1:08:50] day that you walk around. Every devil
[1:08:52] should know you believe that.
[1:08:56] That's good.
[1:08:57] To live worthy of these truths is to
[1:08:59] live worthy of the gospel.
[1:09:02] To see yourself
[1:09:04] as God sees you. That's that was the
[1:09:07] secret that Jesus had.
[1:09:10] Amen. That's he didn't know everything
[1:09:13] humanly speaking. He says he didn't.
[1:09:15] Brother Brandham makes that clear and
[1:09:16] the scripture makes that clear. He did
[1:09:18] not know everything at at all times. He
[1:09:21] he he moved by vision that God showed
[1:09:25] him what to do and showed him and told
[1:09:27] him what to say. And so so so we realize
[1:09:30] then that that the strength of his power
[1:09:34] was that he knew who he was because he
[1:09:38] had been theophony. He knew he came from
[1:09:40] God. It was a revelation that he had.
[1:09:42] And that gave him the strength. He even
[1:09:45] though he was tempted in all ways, he
[1:09:47] overcame it.
[1:09:48] Even though he he he faced trials that
[1:09:51] all of us would have failed against, but
[1:09:54] I'm here to tell you, he just kept
[1:09:55] going. And he kept going because he knew
[1:09:58] who he was, where he came from, where he
[1:10:00] was going. He knew who had all power.
[1:10:03] And and you might not have been a
[1:10:04] Theophony before you were a body, but
[1:10:06] that's why you've heard a word. And when
[1:10:09] you heard a word, you heard from your
[1:10:11] theophony.
[1:10:13] And when I heard from my theophony,
[1:10:15] suddenly I have to say, I can be
[1:10:17] overcomer. I can make it. I can get
[1:10:20] there. I I can be all things to Christ
[1:10:25] because I have also heard from my
[1:10:28] theophony. And I see myself as God sees
[1:10:31] me. I see. Say, what does that mean to
[1:10:34] see myself as God sees me? See yourself
[1:10:36] as eternal. See yourself as transformed.
[1:10:40] Not going to be are. You are
[1:10:42] transformed.
[1:10:44] See yourself as empowered. Have
[1:10:47] confidence. Live with confidence. Put
[1:10:49] down condemnation under your feet.
[1:10:54] He whom the son has made free is free
[1:10:58] indeed.
[1:10:59] Hallelujah. That's when I'm strong, when
[1:11:01] I'm weak, I'm still free in Christ.
[1:11:04] Even when I'm I'm I'm soaring and
[1:11:06] overcoming power or when I stumble and I
[1:11:08] go to my knees, I come up, I'm still a
[1:11:10] son.
[1:11:12] Hallelujah. I'm still empowered.
[1:11:15] Oh, glory to God.
[1:11:17] So, this is the sum of our lives,
[1:11:19] friends. Stay Christ centered. Stay
[1:11:22] spiritled.
[1:11:24] Amen.
[1:11:24] Amen.
[1:11:25] Make that your daily operation.
[1:11:28] Stay Christ minded. Amen.
[1:11:31] I remember a couple of years ago when uh
[1:11:34] brother Timothy Puit was preaching here
[1:11:38] and he I I think this he took that
[1:11:40] sermon called the mission is still on or
[1:11:42] something like that. He told the story
[1:11:45] of the uh of the commando, US commando,
[1:11:49] who had, you know, lost his whole team
[1:11:51] and caught behind enemy lines and shot
[1:11:54] himself, but he had a mission. And he
[1:11:57] he's crawling. You remember the story?
[1:12:00] And he's crawling and he would he said,
[1:12:02] "All I could do was lift myself up. His
[1:12:04] legs wouldn't work." And he said, "I
[1:12:06] pushed myself forward and collapsed. I'd
[1:12:09] catch my breath, lift myself up, push
[1:12:11] myself. if I'd see if I can just get to
[1:12:13] that rock, if I can just get to that
[1:12:15] rock, and then I can get to the next
[1:12:16] rock. And he did that for seven miles.
[1:12:20] Amen.
[1:12:21] Because he came to this conclusion, my
[1:12:24] team is dead. I'm half dead. That looks
[1:12:27] like I have no chance, but the mission
[1:12:29] is still on.
[1:12:31] And he refused to accept anything other
[1:12:34] than the mission is still on.
[1:12:37] Oh, friends, stand to your feet with me.
[1:12:40] I'm here to tell you the mission is
[1:12:42] still on.
[1:12:44] And the sum of our lives is a life of
[1:12:47] deep dedication and service to the king.
[1:12:51] You're entitled to it.
[1:12:53] You believe that? Come. Musicians, come,
[1:12:54] brother Anthony. You're entitled to it.
[1:12:57] I I I I want you to to take that home
[1:13:00] with you. If if you have I I I didn't
[1:13:03] come here just to just to give you a
[1:13:05] rahrh pep rally. I'm here to tell you
[1:13:07] what the word of God says about you. And
[1:13:09] I want you to leave here believing it. I
[1:13:12] want you to be confident of this one
[1:13:14] thing that God who began a good work in
[1:13:18] you will finish it.
[1:13:22] And the devil can't stop it.
[1:13:23] Amen.
[1:13:24] And I'm glad even I can't stop it.
[1:13:26] Amen. I just want to say, Lord God,
[1:13:28] every day, every hour of my life. Let's
[1:13:32] raise up our hands and tonight and say,
[1:13:34] "Lord God, every day, every hour of my
[1:13:37] life, Lord, the it's all about
[1:13:40] commitment. It's all about a
[1:13:41] willingness, Lord, to have you as the
[1:13:43] center of my life. These are dangerous
[1:13:47] times, Lord. The world falling to
[1:13:50] pieces.
[1:13:51] And Father, the only hope is in Christ
[1:13:53] is in the word." And right
[1:13:55] my heart, Lord, I I I know that you have
[1:13:58] children who Lord who who maybe hear
[1:14:02] this sermon tonight. And I pray that no
[1:14:06] matter where they imagine that they are
[1:14:10] on the spiritual ladder, whether they
[1:14:13] feel like they're at the higher rungs of
[1:14:15] it or down midways or even barely
[1:14:17] clinging to the last rungs, wherever
[1:14:19] they are, may they realize that they
[1:14:22] have a right to be an overcomer. They
[1:14:26] have they if they're on the low rungs,
[1:14:28] they don't have to stay there and no one
[1:14:30] can force them to stay there. They have
[1:14:32] a divine privilege to climb higher and
[1:14:35] climb higher and and Lord, we're
[1:14:37] climbing up that great mountain, the
[1:14:39] Mount Zion. And tonight, may Lord God,
[1:14:42] may the Holy Spirit make it so that we
[1:14:45] could just reach up and get a little
[1:14:47] higher handhold on the side of Mount
[1:14:49] Zion as I climb to the top. I'm not
[1:14:53] going back down, Lord. I'm ascending to
[1:14:55] the top. And I pray for the strength of
[1:14:58] the spirit of God. Lord, for the
[1:15:01] anointing of the Holy Spirit that we
[1:15:03] might feel, Lord, that relationship with
[1:15:06] you in a meaningful way.
[1:15:09] Help us one and all. We commit it to you
[1:15:12] in Jesus' name. Come on and gather
[1:15:14] friends. We got a little bit of time to
[1:15:16] take up our prayer request. Let's sing,
[1:15:18] Brother Tony. Amen.
[1:15:22] I need thee. Oh, come singing that old
[1:15:26] wonderful hymn.
[1:15:27] Every
[1:15:29] hour,
[1:15:32] I need thee.
[1:15:34] Oh, that's so true. That's so true.
[1:15:37] Oh, bless
[1:15:39] me now,
[1:15:42] my savior.
[1:15:47] For I come
[1:15:52] to
[1:15:54] thee. Sing it again. I need thee. Oh, I
[1:15:57] need thee.
[1:16:00] I need
[1:16:02] [Music]
[1:16:03] thee. Oh,
[1:16:06] I need
[1:16:07] I need thee.
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:12] Every
[1:16:15] hour
[1:16:18] I need thee.
[1:16:21] [Applause]
[1:16:23] Oh, bless
[1:16:26] me now.
[1:16:29] My savior.
[1:16:35] I come
[1:16:38] I come to
[1:16:41] to thee.
[1:16:44] Let me read these requests out for us
[1:16:46] tonight. Um,
[1:16:52] okay. That's a testimony from Sister
[1:16:54] Princess. I'll catch that just in a
[1:16:55] second.
[1:16:58] Let me forget to read that.
[1:17:00] So, uh, I have these requests
[1:17:05] [Music]
[1:17:08] Sister Jean has two unspoken requests
[1:17:11] tonight and is asking for prayer. Um
[1:17:16] Ethan and Amariah both prayer for Ethan
[1:17:18] and Amariah who are both homesick with a
[1:17:22] stomach bug. There's a lot of sickness
[1:17:23] going around. Uh Sister Deborah Lowry,
[1:17:26] also sick, needs a touch from the Lord.
[1:17:31] Um, brother Caleb Campbell writes in,
[1:17:33] "Brother Jason, would you pray for Uriah
[1:17:35] and Lana tonight? They both are still
[1:17:37] sick and are fighting these terrible
[1:17:39] coughs. Especially Uriah, Brother Kenny
[1:17:41] also let me know that he's still very
[1:17:43] sick." And so, a lot of sickness. I
[1:17:46] believe we can pray with authority,
[1:17:48] friends.
[1:17:50] Sister Phyllis is asking for prayer.
[1:17:52] She's with her sister Susie. And I think
[1:17:55] her brother Matt's coming in tomorrow.
[1:17:56] and her sister Susie scheduled for that
[1:17:59] double mastctomy on third on the 30th,
[1:18:01] June the 30th. And they're asking
[1:18:03] prayer. She took that prayer cloth
[1:18:06] and we're looking for the Lord to do
[1:18:08] great things. Brother Bruce Paris
[1:18:09] writes, "Brother Jason, I have a prayer
[1:18:11] request. I'm having some abdominal
[1:18:13] distress and my left knee that was
[1:18:16] replaced many years ago is causing me a
[1:18:18] lot of pain when attempting to lift my
[1:18:20] leg. Perhaps it's tendonitis. Thank you
[1:18:22] so much and God bless you, brother
[1:18:25] Bruce.
[1:18:27] Sister Lois uh Payne writes in, "We have
[1:18:31] our court date in Georgia tomorrow
[1:18:33] morning. They're in a little bit of a of
[1:18:36] a of a dispute on a property and the
[1:18:38] there's a person giving them a lot of
[1:18:40] trouble and
[1:18:42] it's it's so it's just the devil causing
[1:18:45] this person." Brother Rodney has bent
[1:18:47] over backwards to be fair with this
[1:18:48] person. And so they're having to go to
[1:18:51] court and Rodney would like our probate
[1:18:53] court appointment to be covered by the
[1:18:55] blood of Jesus Christ. We thank God in
[1:18:58] advance for his will. Amen. It's to do
[1:19:01] to do with some air property that he
[1:19:04] received through inheritance. Um don't
[1:19:06] want to say any more than that, but just
[1:19:08] be praying that the Lord will have his
[1:19:10] perfect will and perfect way. I think I
[1:19:13] covered them all. Let me make sure that
[1:19:15] I didn't miss any that just come in. I
[1:19:18] don't see any there.
[1:19:24] Let me go ahead and read this from
[1:19:25] Sister Princess
[1:19:28] testimony from mom.
[1:19:31] This is her mother. God is so good to
[1:19:33] me. As I was leaving the office today, I
[1:19:36] saw this with my own eyes. Lightning
[1:19:38] struck the uh the tele the the tele the
[1:19:42] telephone pole at the end of the
[1:19:43] driveway where my car was sitting at
[1:19:46] work. Literally next to the pole. Sparks
[1:19:48] and fire was falling everywhere. I felt
[1:19:52] my car shake, but the pole didn't split.
[1:19:54] Literally thought my car had caught
[1:19:57] fire. Cars slowed down when they saw it
[1:20:00] uh it blocking my exit. I waited and
[1:20:02] prayed until I was able to pull out of
[1:20:05] the driveway onto the road with a praise
[1:20:07] on my lips and heart. It shook me up a
[1:20:09] little bit, but ain't nobody mad but
[1:20:12] that devil.
[1:20:14] Amen. God ain't through with me yet.
[1:20:17] Amen, Sister Princess. That's the truth.
[1:20:19] Uh the Lord is not finished with mom. I
[1:20:22] can't help but give him praise. He who
[1:20:26] he uh who
[1:20:29] Oh my I'm just going to read her words.
[1:20:31] I can't help but give him praise. Who
[1:20:33] wouldn't Oh, yeah. Who wouldn't serve a
[1:20:35] God like that? Amen. I agree with that.
[1:20:38] Also, remember my mom. She's having some
[1:20:41] tests done. Um, y'all pray all be well.
[1:20:44] Sister Princess, is this your testimony
[1:20:47] or your mom? Says testimony from mom.
[1:20:49] But, uh, so I'm just going to believe
[1:20:51] it. That's the way it is. It looks like
[1:20:52] a testimony from your mom, but also she
[1:20:55] says, "Remember my mom." She's having
[1:20:57] some tests done today. Pray all will be
[1:20:59] well. I'm pretty sure that's a testimony
[1:21:01] of her mother. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:04] You love the Lord, say, "Amen."
[1:21:06] Amen. That's all the prayer requests
[1:21:09] that I see. I don't have any. Uh just
[1:21:11] one last check. Amen. Let's go to the
[1:21:14] Lord in prayer. Join with somebody
[1:21:16] standing near you. And let's go down
[1:21:18] this list. Father, we're coming before
[1:21:20] you for Ethan and Amariah right now.
[1:21:22] Lord, this sickness is plaguing. Lord,
[1:21:25] your family. We're thinking of brother
[1:21:27] Kenny's sick. We're thinking of little
[1:21:29] Uriah and Lana sick. Lord, we're we're
[1:21:32] realizing brother Bruce and in this
[1:21:33] discomfort, Sister Deborah Lowry and all
[1:21:36] of this sickness, Lord God, you're
[1:21:38] you're you're our Jehovah Rafa. You're
[1:21:41] the God that healeth all thy diseases.
[1:21:44] Lord, I pray for these children of thy
[1:21:46] kingdom that you will bring them back to
[1:21:49] health tonight, Lord. Uh put the devil
[1:21:51] to flight, Lord God, and rebuke him.
[1:21:54] May, brother Ethan, Sister Amriiah,
[1:21:56] Brother Kenny, Sister Deborah, Brother
[1:21:58] Bruce, Brother uh Uriah, Sister Lana,
[1:22:01] Lord, may they know the healing virtue
[1:22:03] of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray Lord
[1:22:06] God for Sister Phyllis there ministering
[1:22:09] to her family and her her younger
[1:22:11] sister. Lord, you see what she's facing.
[1:22:13] But Lord, you have a daughter there and
[1:22:15] she has a prayer cloth and we sent it
[1:22:17] with faith. Lord God, do the
[1:22:19] supernatural among them. I pray Lord God
[1:22:22] that you will have your perfect will and
[1:22:24] perfect way. These unspoken requests
[1:22:26] that Sister Jean has, you know very well
[1:22:28] what they are. You're still Jehovah
[1:22:30] Gyra, Lord. You can do all things, oh
[1:22:33] God. And we look to you for deliverance
[1:22:36] in these needs. We think about Brother
[1:22:38] Rodney, Lord, tomorrow in the probate
[1:22:40] court. I pray as the brother prayed and
[1:22:42] we're agreeing with him, it'll be
[1:22:43] covered by the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:45] Christ that the Holy Spirit will be
[1:22:47] there to compel truth and justice. Grant
[1:22:50] it, Lord God. Bring it to pass. Lord
[1:22:52] God, let us hear back the wonderful
[1:22:55] testimony of all of these, Lord God, who
[1:22:57] are sick and suffering and all of these
[1:23:00] who need deliverance and all of these
[1:23:01] who need the power of God to move in
[1:23:03] their lives. May you grant it to them,
[1:23:06] Lord. We are believers tonight, Lord.
[1:23:08] Let the word that was preached for uh
[1:23:10] tonight go forth, Lord God, in power and
[1:23:13] demonstration in the lives of the
[1:23:14] people. May we be able to prove Lord God
[1:23:17] this this authority as the family of God
[1:23:22] Lord we are and we are accepting the
[1:23:24] revelation of our identity in Christ
[1:23:28] Father and we surrender. Help us Lord
[1:23:29] God every day to surrender to it more.
[1:23:32] Let my life be a life of sacrificial
[1:23:35] obedience. Oh God grant it to us Lord.
[1:23:39] Grant us that spirit of sacrificial
[1:23:41] obedience, Lord, that we may be pleasing
[1:23:44] to you in all things, in all ways, at
[1:23:46] all times, in any situation. May we put
[1:23:50] you first. May you be the center of our
[1:23:53] lives. May you be first, Lord God. As a
[1:23:55] prophet said, make him first. Don't make
[1:23:58] him second. He doesn't want to be
[1:24:00] second. He doesn't deserve to be second.
[1:24:03] Make him first. Grant it to us, Lord. We
[1:24:07] love you. We thank you from true hearts.
[1:24:09] We love you, Lord. These are trying
[1:24:10] times. We want to draw near to you, Lord
[1:24:13] God. I pray you'll grant it to us in
[1:24:15] Jesus' name. Amen. Let's sing some more
[1:24:17] of that before we take up any
[1:24:19] testimonies. Amen. Give us another verse
[1:24:21] of it, Tony.
[1:24:27] Or whatever you were going to say.
[1:24:29] Amen. Pass
[1:24:32] me not. Oh gentle
[1:24:36] say
[1:24:39] your
[1:24:43] hear
[1:24:45] my humble
[1:24:49] cry.
[1:24:52] [Music]
[1:24:52] [Applause]
[1:24:56] Well,
[1:24:58] on others
[1:25:01] thou art
[1:25:09] to
[1:25:12] not pass
[1:25:15] by.
[1:25:20] I cry.
[1:25:25] Savior
[1:25:29] Savior.
[1:25:34] Hear my cry.
[1:25:36] Hear
[1:25:37] my
[1:25:42] cry.
[1:25:51] All others
[1:25:54] thou are called your calling Lord. Thank
[1:25:57] God we
[1:26:01] need to do
[1:26:04] not
[1:26:07] leave.
[1:26:11] Amen. Anybody got a testimony tonight?
[1:26:13] We read the one from Sister Princess.
[1:26:16] Anybody else got a testimony before we
[1:26:17] go? Oh, Sister Meredith right behind
[1:26:19] you.
[1:26:24] Um, just an update on my brother. Uh, he
[1:26:27] came through surgery really well and
[1:26:29] he's doing really good. He's having to
[1:26:32] get used to that clicking cuz it's a
[1:26:35] mechanical valve. So, he it's kind of um
[1:26:39] scared him a couple of times cuz when he
[1:26:41] gets a little out of breath, it'll start
[1:26:44] clicking a lot more and he thinks
[1:26:45] something's wrong, but it's fine. Um,
[1:26:49] and uh,
[1:26:52] I had and my also my nephew, he um, it's
[1:26:57] it's been a couple of months, but he
[1:26:59] injured his knee and um, they were they
[1:27:03] were told that he's he's an athlete and
[1:27:06] they were told that he didn't need an
[1:27:07] MRI and they waited around for probably
[1:27:11] about two months and finally got another
[1:27:15] MRI. got an MRI because it wasn't
[1:27:17] getting better and he had a really rare
[1:27:21] meniscus tear
[1:27:23] and um it's he's he's got a lot of
[1:27:26] energy. He's a very energetic kid and
[1:27:29] this was kind of devastating for him
[1:27:31] because it was going to be a long
[1:27:32] recovery and he actually had his surgery
[1:27:36] um today and when they got in there it
[1:27:39] actually wasn't as bad as they thought
[1:27:41] it was and they said he should recover
[1:27:43] really well. So we really thankful for
[1:27:45] that.
[1:27:46] Thank the Lord. Amen.
[1:27:53] Before we go, anybody going once? Going
[1:27:55] twice. All right, turn around. Shake
[1:27:58] hands with each other. Say, "God bless
[1:28:00] you. We'll see you the weekend." You can
