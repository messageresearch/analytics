appreciate pastor watkins and all the different brothers and sisters and loved ones that are here amen good to see jd and matt everybody amen i heard brother luke is going through a little something but i know he's probably watching hallelujah hey man see the devil tried to separate us and you know it's it's a you know the prophet of god said some things that's created can be used for good hallelujah and now the internet is being used for good hallelujah amen it's a substitute but it's being used for good amen we like the real thing now we love coming to church but if you can't make it amen we can stream it amen we just thank god greetings from brother anderson everybody else back home maybe let's have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of god tonight lord jesus

in your hands and we bless your holy name in the name of jesus christ we pray the church amen amen praise the lord amen he's god alone if you have your bibles amen let's turn to um matthew chapter 17. matthew chapter 17. hallelujah i hope you guys are just really appreciative of the the ministries you sit up under amen because i don't get a chance to actually hear brother jason a lot but when i do i certainly enjoyed it hey man i did we did some meetings together a couple months ago and i was thoroughly blessed hallelujah hey man matthew 17. hey man uh let's start reading that um verse 10 just kind of make the reading short here's this matthew 17 and 10 the bible says and his disciples asked him saying why then say the stripes that elias must first come and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall come and restore all things but i say unto you that elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they list likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist amen let's go second timothy chapter three second timothy three and uh let's start reading at verse one second timothy and three the bible says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covenants bolsters proud blasphemous disobedient to parents unthankful unholy my now these are some powerful adjectives but this is the atmosphere of the world today this he says without natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are doing the despises of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a oh my having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away now i want us to catch this he gave all those descriptions of what people are going to be and then at the end of it he said they're having a form of godliness so having a form of godliness including traitors unthankful unholy these are all these people but they are in church having a form of godliness this he says four of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with diverse lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth oh my let's go to second timothy i mean um ii peter chapter 3. second peter three um let's start at verse three knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming i'm sure we all can say we've heard that he says for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation oh my may the lord bless the reading of his word you can have your seats thank god for the word you know by by the help of the lord tonight god's grace i kind of want this message to be a reminder hallelujah because i think sometimes we can get caught up in living you know how it is just in your daily life you know sometimes we have to put stuff on our calendar so we can be reminded of it because we get so busy that we'll forget something that's important that's why we write it down that's why we put the reminder there so we know we have to go to work we set our clocks at a certain time so we can be on time amen as a reminder hallelujah but you know i think sometimes so much go on in the world that there's so much that's been revealed to us we have to be reminded of what god has already done what god has already given us and my subject tonight is prophecy will or are or has already come to pass hallelujah prophecy will or already has come to pass hallelujah in church if we take just matthew 17 the disciples begin to ask christ they say what does it mean when you you know when they say elias must first come you know and jesus response was it's true elias is going to come and restore all things so we can see that the coming of elias should restore all things and for us as believers we believe that that spirit of elias has came come on church we believe that the spirit of alliance has came hallelujah and if the spirit of elias has came all things to the believer has been restored so to us prophecy has already been fulfilled hallelujah to say that there's more that's going to be fulfilled but if we can receive the coming of elias we're standing in the midst and in the town of prophecy right now and you know church i think that's why the devil fights this message so hard holy because he i got a new saying that i heard he don't want us to catch up with ourselves hallelujah because if we catch up with ourselves we will step into the vision hallelujah and that's what the enemy don't want that's why he keeps fighting it that's why he keeps trying to bring things to make it look like it's something natural when it's something supernatural hallelujah and you know if i could just say this you know the prophet's ministry was a ministry of vision hallelujah it was a ministry that told things to come hallelujah you know it said that when the seventh angel messenger begins to sound that the mystery of god shall be finished hallelujah and if it's finished that means all things are restored hallelujah i'll say it again hallelujah that we have experienced prophecy fulfilled already so when it comes to matthew 17 i can stand here and say to you church by revelation this day the scripture has been fulfilled hallelujah but we have to look at it as more than just a bunch of quotes and and and and and just a bunch of lies but it's a life hallelujah that god has brought to us that's been fulfilled but listen i want to say something to you right quick in in in the message the prophet preached he said a spiritual dream is interpreted rightly interpreted is the same as a vision and what is a vision a vision is the forecast of future events amen hallelujah so we studied this message how many of you could see that the forecast was right hallelujah amen church when you're really paying attention to the person that whatever you call the man with the weather what are they called meteorologists am i right if you're really paying attention to that meteorologist hallelujah you address accordingly for the next day hallelujah and you listen to him i want you to catch this you listen to him by faith hallelujah you believe what he say by faith hallelujah what he's saying has never been proven before you step into that next day by faith hallelujah because he said something and according to his job he has the credentials to back it up so nobody questions it hallelujah he puts all his graphs up all these different things church we've had graphs put up hallelujah graphs that cannot be denied hallelujah graphs that cannot be changed hallelujah we got grabs amen that tells us the future but what god is trying to get us to do is trust the messenger hallelujah trust the messenger because amen churches like this if that look look at it church if that meteorologist gets it wrong he still don't lose his job but we got a meteorologist we got a meteorologist that never gets it wrong and people still won't trust him everything he's ever said has come to pass now i'm not just talking about brother branham i'm talking about christ because what brother branham said hallelujah could only come from christ the owner of the station hallelujah in church look at it oh my love i love it when it comes fresh hallelujah church i i i just appreciate it so much because a vision is a forecast of the future and we know that the prophet he preached by vision but what i want to say tonight by the grace of god thank you brother what i want to say tonight is that when you catch the vision of malachi 4 you step into the future you step into future events hallelujah and me and somebody else was talking and she said i want to live in my present i'm like no i don't want to live in my presence i want to live in my future because in my present i'm in a body of death in my present i can get sick in my presence i can have mine battles in my present hallelujah i can be discouraged but in my future i am eternal in my future hallelujah i have the promise of the resurrection in my future i can never die in my future i can never be sick in my future the joy of the lord is my strength so i don't want to live in my pricing i want to live in my future because in my future i fellowship have relationship with christ jesus forever that's my forecast that's our forecast holy that's your forecast tonight the thing of it is is do you believe it holy are you preparing for that day because if they say it's gonna rain what do we do we get our rain gear some of you got rain boots and they look ridiculous but that doesn't stop you from putting it on why because it's going to protect your feet from getting wet in church they say hallelujah that our forecast may look ridiculous by how we dress hallelujah but you know what it's protecting me for days to come it's protecting me from the wrath of god hallelujah and we know you no good as anybody sometimes in beaufort when it rains hit pause so you have to have on the right gear hallelujah cause if you ain't got on the right gear you may be swept away hallelujah whoa you got to be in the right vehicle hallelujah because you got swamps and alligators down here but church no matter what the forecast is holly you trust the meteorologists holy nobody questions that meteorologist they wait to see if it's going to come to pass hallelujah in church we have a message that god has given us that has forecast our future hallelujah oh my and are we living in our future are we living in the prophecies that have been fulfilled church don't let the enemy lukewarm your love for god because when you go back in timothy hallelujah he said in in in in timothy he said in the last days perilous times shall come church we are here we're living in perilous times and just in case you haven't realized we've had a preview of what a world a world order government looks like we had a preview of it in these last two years covet made everybody fall under the same orders hallelujah every country every nation everybody shut down the same way and they put mandates in that every leader every president hallelujah every overseer had to follow but listen here we already knew the forecast for that hallelujah that's why you shouldn't be afraid hallelujah because god has gave us a glimpse of the future hallelujah so even though we experienced hollywood that piece of prophecy church think about how good it is to the believer when you can see it before it happens that's where we are i'm gonna show you some things tonight holy that god has already showed us and we're watching it happen but we don't realize we are part of the vision we are the fulfillment in the prophecy got somebody whoa oh my church look at these kind of people that are in church he says hollywood for me it shall be lovers of their own selves covetousness bolsters proud blasphemers i'm sure most of us know at least one person in one of those categories but let's keep going he says disobedient to parents oh my god i'mma leave y'all young people alone i ain't talking about in the world i'm talking about in church hollywood these kind of spirits are lingering in church holy i just got back from brother crosby him and the lord the lord was dealing with me to to speak to them even though y'all experiencing supernatural i mean real they experienced real supernatural things in that church he said make sure it's inspired by the holy ghost because satan can impersonate any gift but one thing he can't impersonate is that life hallelujah church hallelujah oh my listen he says without he says he says disobedient to parents unthankful oh mom sure we see people unthankful unthankful unholy oh my you know now brother jason you try to teach people and tell them what the bible say and because their spirits are unholy they'll just say well i ain't there yet i just don't see it god got to show it to me i clear those kind of people i really want to lay hands on them without the prayer because it's that kind of attitude that really shows you don't care holy cause we know let me back up a little bit church uh uh before i before i started preaching tonight what i should have said was this is the absolute we live by this there's no errors in us there's no false in us and let me make it real clear these are not brother diggs's words these are the words of god so if i quote anything out of here it's not my words it's how god feels and if you can't listen to what i'm saying coming out of here you're not listening to me you're rejecting god hallelujah and that's what we find out too many people are looking at the person not even realizing that we're just agents we're just agents oh my he said without natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good oh my god there we are church look over the past couple years how much we've been persecuted for just trying to live truth show me in the scripture hallelujah where is wrong hallelujah to serve one god show me this scripture where is wrong to just love one woman that's what marriage and divorce is all about god's trying to keep you steady on the path hallelujah stand right in his eyes because god ain't got multiple women he got one bride oh my god but they're going to look at the prophet and say oh he made mistakes and all these things who cares the thing that they've missed holly they missed the prophecy for their lives too busy trying to put it on somebody else look he said write the vision make it plain and when it speak it will not lie so the vision for your life it will not lie hallelujah oh my that's why i don't waste my time per se trying to defend the message to an unbeliever hallelujah because you got to be a believer to see it amen and furthermore when i defend the message i don't defend it with the bible and with quotes i defended by where i came from i defended by what i used to be hallelujah i'm defeated by my own desires now hallelujah i don't always take the people to jeffersonville and take them back to look no i break into south carolina hallelujah when god took rap music out of my life and sin and lying and cheating and still hallelujah i didn't get that in a pillow across the church i got that sitting right here listening to this message listening to these tapes that said good evening friends hallelujah i am a product of this message and i came straight out of the world oh my so you young people can't tell me that this word ain't true you adults of middle age or whoever else is playing with their future hallelujah y'all know a couple years ago south carolina got caught slipping they had a forecast of snow coming they had a forecast of snow coming and the schools tucking light and they said you know what we're just going to dismiss like we normally do and they dismiss like they normally do and the kids and the bus drivers got caught in the snowstorm some of them didn't get home to 10 o'clock that night because they wasn't prepared for the forecast even though it was already told to him church what about us are you prepared even though the forecast has been told to you but you know what after that you know they say fool me one time shame on you fool me again shame on me so you know what they did church hollywood they just did a couple weeks ago they forecast some serious thunderstorms they let the kids out 12 o'clock where i'm from and y'all know how colombia is it'll act like it wanna come and then they say nah i think we're gonna turn hallelujah south carolina period hallelujah blizzard can be coming he could be coming up from atlanta coming strong then that thing say ah south carolina now we're gonna mess with y'all go a different way and our kids how to experience a free day out of school but what happened what happened the overseers they took the forecast seriously hallelujah and we are in a time church where we need to take these prophecies and visions that has some have been fulfilled and some are being fulfilled seriously hallelujah church i'll be the first one to say i can feel the pool of the world trying to get us relaxed hallelujah i fight that same spirit trying to get me relaxed and just just kick back and do your own thing because all this is happening in the message and all this is happening daddy ain't gonna change the forecast that ain't going to change the prophecy and the visions that god has already put in place churches in motion the prophet of god said for destruction to come the people must be in the atmosphere of destruction i'm gonna read it to you oh my hallelujah oh my church said traders heady high minded lovers of pressure pleasure more than lovers of god indeed he concludes that by saying having a form of godliness all these people are having a form of godliness and the probably god said what was that form of godliness not willing to go on into the holy ghost homer help us lord church i don't want to take the forecast lightly because he said he said to his disciples truly isaiah's must come and then he comes back he says and has come already and you missed it how privileged should we feel hallelujah that we can recognize the spirit of elijah has come already and we called it like one brother told me they left the message and i loved the brothers a dear brother we sat down and talked and he said brother i'm sorry brother i just don't believe that brother brandon was a prophet and all these things and blah blah blah blah blah and he said i said well what i said well what was the purpose of who else who is elijah then i say who's fulfilling the scripture of our hearts being turned back he said well he said i believe john did all that i said couldn't be because god deals with shadows and types hallelujah because if john fulfilled all that it'll be no purpose for jesus to come hallelujah because a prophet always introduces something greater hallelujah and if john fulfilled it all john would have went to the cross and that would be lit for us hallelujah but john only preached repentance hallelujah and john died the death of a regular man oh yeah but then he introduced us into something and by john's old testimony john could see the forecast changing hallelujah they said john are you the messiah john said no hallelujah i'm just the voice of one crying out in the wilderness he knew what he was in the prophecy do you know who you are in the prophecy he could find that word that identified him and nobody could take it and he didn't live his life in fear either john said there's one coming whose shoelaces i'm not even worthy to unlatch you he said i'll tell you something else he's already here y'all just can't reckon y'all just can't recognize it hallelujah that's why we had a prophet to come and say if god does something one way that's his forever way and our john came and revealed jesus to us and everybody around still couldn't recognize it because our god is the same but blessed are ye because you see and you hear blessed are ye hallelujah because you are a part of the prophecy the only reason why we're here amen because we are part of the message we are what makes the message come out wow i feel my helper coming on bro jason wow hallelujah i feel like i'm riding one of them bugs with them big old horse a big old hump in his back but he can't throw me tonight i was born to ride hollywood said i'll ride this trail again not him as a man hallelujah but the message will ride that trail again hallelujah we rising right now church catch the forecast i ain't gonna say it's gonna rain but it's gonna rain down fire that's our forecast but i'm so glad prophecy concerning my life says i won't be here church i'm getting dressed for a venison act bro jason i got on invisible clothes the bible says great is the mystery of godliness hallelujah i'm preparing to step into a whole other dimension hallelujah because i'm being dressed by god's dress where which is what he said a five-fold ministry he's getting us ready church do we i know y'all feel what i feel this stuff shouldn't be coming to us but it should excite us honey we know it's going to happen we know what the next day beholds god has shown us his eyes he's so listen have we ever heard a prophet say talk about god in the back part of his mind oh my oh what a meteorologist listen i don't want to be alone but i'm i'm feeling good let's get into it a little bit before i close hey man i'm gonna start i'm sure most of you know that the prophet has seven visions 1933 that's when god gave him those major seven visions holy concerning the forecast not just for church but the world hollywood he gave forecasts for nations honey he gave forecasts for countries wow and he gave the forecast for where we at america oh my listen if i can start right i ain't going to read all of them but i'ma start i believe this is the second vision he says if y'all got a brother he says the next vision foretold that an australian by the name of adolf hitler austrian i'm sorry see i'm excited i'm messing up my words my daughter gone my daughter gonna get on me when we get in the car you were saying media geologists but the prize understands what i'm saying uh she can hear when nobody else can't hear hallelujah church listen he said y'all know a austrian name adolf hitler now most of us know who that is but look god gave a forecast of him before he even got in position got to him and i wasn't even born then but the same person that had a forecast for my day forecast this so the reason why i'm bringing this up is because this came to pass did not germany start a war harley did not germany hallelujah the leader of the germans thought that the germans was the greatest race hallelujah and i'm sad to say hallelujah well i'm not sad to say i'm proud to say hallelujah that when they had the olympics god use a black man named jesse owens that i'ma show you hallelujah that the german race is not the superior race wow hallelujah and i got i got holly on the books church hallelujah i got something on the books i got a forecast on the books where the prophet said that a white man will never get in the areas a black man can get into hallelujah and he proved it with jesse always hallelujah jesus started running hardly started running hallelujah in that day he won one gold medal he won two gold medals three gold medals he walked away with six gold medals prove it to hitler you started this war but we gonna finish it but y'all know in heaven is only one race harley the bride of christ hallelujah he says look he will rise up as a dictator over germany harley do you realize church i was listening to these prophecies and in one place he talked about for america that a woman would rise up in power hallelujah y'all know who controlling germany a woman that rose up in power he said the letter of c in age is women rights church i looked it up who are the most 10 most powerful women i mean people aren't in the world today and she was number three it wasn't based upon how much money they got hallelujah because jeff bezos was behind her and he's a billionaire you better hope you ain't living in ladder to see you i hope you catching that listen he says oh my almost well i'm out of time okay he says he says that he had drawn the world into war it showed that the siegfried line and how our troops would have a terrible time to overcome it then it showed that hitler would come to a mysterious end is that prophecy go find it in the library it'll be exactly like the prophet said oh my let's keep going this is the third he said the third vision was in the realm of the world politics for it shows that there will be three isms fascism nazism uh communism but that the first two will be swallowed up in the third the voice admonish watch russia where are we where are we church everybody's watching russia holly you know who number two was on that list putin and i know they make different lists but on my list he was number two as one of the most powerful people in the world and we got a prophet streaming out at our forecast saying watch russia everybody got the eyes on russia right now what are we church we're living in the prophecy remember my title prophecy will or already has come to pass oh my watch russia keep your eye on the king of the north and this man is he's so special i don't mean in a good way he's so special every time it's time for him it's his time to come to get voted out he changed the laws basically saying i'm gonna die in this office church i even heard that they have a bounty on his head but nobody can't get to him now you put a man in the office like that what if he just gets mad and just say you know i'm sick of everybody i'm sick of it he's built that way to do what push your butt just like the prophet said i don't i don't know the man all i'm going by is prophecy hallelujah all i'm going about is the characteristics of this forecast being fulfilled hallelujah he says keep your eyes on the king of the north now we're going to get into some sticky water hardly the fourth vision shows the great advances in science that will come after the second world war it will head up in a vision of a plastic bubble top car put that tesla up for me hmm that that kind of looks like a bubble shaped car doing it but i want you to catch the detail of the prophecy he said plastic cars are not made metal anymore they're made by fiberglass most of all our cars out there the only thing metal ones might be the bumper you notice i said might be and probably you the only one y'all with trucks probably the only ones got real bumpers mostly everything now is church look i used to take up i used to be a um auto collision technician harley paint cars and do all that stuff that's what i graduated with holiday church you know i'm gonna give you a secret i'm gonna get you sick i'm gonna make the auto collision people mad if you dent your car if you dent your bumper hey oh man oh man y'all go i always got money front of the dr ball i got a real good trick for you it's plastic go get your wife's blow dryer heat it up what does plastic do when it gets heated up it expands heat it up put your hand on the opposite end and push it out amen so what i'm speaking is truth hallelujah i've done it myself too brother hallelujah see he said in that prophecy bubble plastic hallelujah are we here church are we living in the vision but hallelujah there's something a little bit more special about this car this car not only it's it's a it's a do-fold prophecy it's bubbled holly but he also said i seen a machine that drives itself hallelujah we don't need a driver there we go we're here let's read a little bit more he said a bubble shaped car that was running down beautiful highways under the remote control so that people appeared seated in a car without a steering wheel give me that next one that next car people sitting in the car looks like it's driving on the remote control harley the uber did he get the uber put the uber up church now they have ubers like that that will pick you up without a driver pick you up with a driver without a driver when you get in some kind of way it has visual uh recognition calls your name and tells you exactly where you want to go and you just sit there and do what enjoy the ride we are here the vision the prophecy the forecast is writing church i want y'all young people to see this y'all think we crazy y'all think we're crazy because we oh brother i just don't understand what brother graham came to do look he spoke to us in 33 33 to now is 89 years and look church hallelujah if you say well brother i just don't know holly what i'm reading to you he spoke in 1960 which is 62 years so either way i get you hallelujah you know what's going on one way or another hallelujah he said we have plastic cars remote control look hello not only i didn't have time to put it up but church not only are they doing cars now they're moving into the trucking industry they have trucks that's making deliveries without a driver something that can hold 80 000 pounds and we playing around with our salvation and the word is steadily coming to pass and we're just amazed because we're living down here oh my oh my can i can i can i go old school for a second don't get lost in the sauce church you can put something in the pot and you put so much sauce in there get lost don't get lost in the sauce that's a figure of speech we have so much going on in this world today hallelujah don't forget what's been spoken over you peter said as long as i'm here i'm here to stir you up by the way of remembrance holy oh my church he said they were playing some sort of game and amusing themselves look in that scripture look look before we get into the fifth vision listen luke 17 says as it is as it was in the days of noah so shall it also be in the days of the son of man are we here homosexuals got more rights than we do and they will start the fight and you know people they they they so bold with this stuff now so they ain't even worried about us us christians hallelujah they worry about it they just living their life they do their own thing they not even worried about the prophecy god said if he don't destroy this place he got to raise solomon gomorrah back up why because solomon gomer was a stitch in his nostrils he said the sins of sodom have come up to me and we're right here again in light stain just like it was he said they'll eat they'll drink they'll marry wives and they'll give their giving marriage until the day that noah entered into the heart you know i i'm i'm kind of observative you know if you go if you go over your unsaved loved ones house let's just say they have a cookout or picnic or whatever you go over there you know what it's all centered around eating and drinking that's what it's all about eating enjoyable gonna put out the food they're gonna get they drink they're gonna toast they're gonna throw it back they're gonna have a good time and they don't even realize they're fulfilling the prophecy but they don't realize they fulfilling the prophecy of death oh he said likewise he said he said they married until the day noah entered the ark the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also it was in a day lot they didn't eat they drank they bought they sold that's where we all church hallelujah holly i was doing real estate hollywood on the side as a hobby you know what now churches i mean houses people are getting double their money it's a seller's market hardly people getting 50 60 000 more than what the house is worth and they haven't beaten wars why because the bible said it would be like that in the area i mean hallelujah they finna chop some trees down and say they're gonna build 400 houses we are here church say brothers what is all this about what he's saying is what the scriptures are saying is in the last days holy and what does the last days represent before the coming of the lord so if you don't catch nothing i'm saying tonight all these references i'm making hollywood is referring to the lord is soon to come church we better fight don't get lost in the sauce he said they planted they build hallelujah look the fifth vision had to do with moral problem of our age entering mostly around women god showed me that women began to be out of their place with with granting with with with the granting of the vote then they cut their hair oh my which was signified that they were no longer under authority of a man but insist on equal rights are we here i don't know if y'all pay attention but because i'm in this industry you got more women truck drivers than you got me in just about hallelujah they won't do everything it don't even look right tell you true oh my he said they'll cut off the head as if equal rights and in most cases more than equal rights she said in most cases more than equal rights oh my she adopted man's clothing am i here church are we here hallelujah women look like men now are we there can you see the forecast is it speaking truth hallelujah he said and went into the state of of went into the state of undress until the last picture i saw was a woman naked except for a little fig tree oh my and i'm sure you sisters can verify this they got bathing suits that are nothing but a leaf oh man that's kind of touchy so we gonna leave that alone he said with the vision i saw terrible perversion and more more apply to the whole world that's where we are at church what used to be wrong is considered okay in right now holly i was in seattle a couple weeks ago they got marijuana dispensaries on every corner you pull up like a drive-through let me get something to smoke oh boy marla decay is here but this is the church they legalize it but they know they can't control it it's all about this moral decay listen this is in the message of the revelation of jesus christ he said look at the prophecy the lord gave me in 33 how it would happen they permit women to vote in the voting they elect the wrong person seven things was going to give five of them has already happened this is in 1960 five of them has already happened church you know what we can say now six has already happened oh my he said the next thing was a great woman a church a power or something will take over the united states now i know this seems elementary church but let's remember it's been spoken for us to hear give me that picture of that powerful woman you got people want to argue about this like it didn't happen let's make it real simple he said a woman or the catholic church right let me ask you a question if something happens to joe biden who's going to take over and joe biden was i think number five on the list so if carmilla takes over you know where she'll be number five as one of the most powerful people in the world holy and just in case you don't realize it that prophecy even of her has already come to pass because when joe biden got sick who was running the country stay with me church hallelujah people trying to get some spirit out he's here and stuff happening right before our eyes and we want to get so technical and so spiritual trying to prove everybody wrong when the prophecy is being fulfilled but if if not her what's next put it up brother there you go the catholic church and he said hallelujah we've had one president that was a catholic we got to have another one what was joe biden catholic church before he took the office what did he do he went to mask basically putting the country in the hands of the pope oh my church we are here living in the forecast do not be dismayed by how comfortable it is to be in this united states there are things happening right before our eyes concerning the word of god concerning the prophecies of malachi 4. that's why the enemy is fighting it so hard church that's number six fulfilled let's do that again hallelujah but what i love about it what i love about it is that the weather couldn't trick me holly cause i was ready for it church we can't be tricked because we already know what's going to happen before it happened they say oh my god obama's the antichrist nope i got a prophecy already telling me who the antichrist is oh my god donald trump's the antichrist nope i got a prophecy hallelujah that's fulfilling hallelujah who it is we're looking at the forecast church we're not told around instruments that we don't need i'm not talking an umbrella for snow no i'm living according to what's been revealed i'm not walking in 12 feet 12 inches of snow in adidas no i got the right kind of boots on hallelujah why because god has shown it to us we're here blessed are you for your i see oh my tree church what i'm doing so brothers what this is all about i'm trying just trying i'm trying to make you aware where you're at because you don't want to be like one of our great friends holly we love them we appreciate them and our ex brother editors hardly i say this all the time one time i was out there preaching for him i say brother here we know he was a part of the forecast but he wasn't ready for it he was a part of the forecast and didn't even know it was raining he was a part of the forecast and couldn't even see it coming basically said i'm not a part of it because the meteorologist asked him are you dressed he said no but he had it that's what i love about god you may not know it but god gonna make sure you don't miss it because if you're supposed to be there in the rain you gon get wet hallelujah if you're supposed to be there when the hurricane comes you gonna be there hallelujah and that's brother they asked her brother ed when when the prophet gave when he told you all about the caribou and the silver temp well y'all back like oh boy i can't wait till it happened he said no man was just a bunch of young guys ready to hunt yeah wasn't even thinking about the forecast holly but i love god holly i love god so much you cannot hardly understand that you are part of it but he'll make sure you in the place you're supposed to be in because the prophet said hallelujah after he had gotten the caribou order simple till one of the two he said now who got on that green checkered shirt and he turned around he said eddie look at the shirt you got on there like oh my god i'm a part of the vision hallelujah church don't be like that praise god we love hey man what god has done to those people on books and tapes but we should be more aware we should be more aware we should be watching hallelujah these signs and these wonders and these things being fulfilled hallelujah church we even got a message to back it up he preached modern day events fulfilled by prophecy hallelujah oh my hold my church but what we should be and what we are amen in my closing is a rebecca hallelujah because eliza went out to get a bride and he knew in his own human ability he couldn't choose right for his lord so what did he do he spoke a vision he spoke something he he wanted to see fulfilled and by that word he knew she was the one by that word he knew she was the one and what did you say let the woman that not only gives me drink but also give my camel's drink be my servant be my my master's wife be the one harley and the scripture says as soon as he gave the forecast hallelujah rebecca came out to the whale hallelujah she came out with her water pot you know what she was doing she was minding her own business hallelujah but she didn't even know unconsciously she was fulfilling the prophet's vision hallelujah because you know eliezer was a type of the prophet hallelujah william branham amen hallelujah did i say this all the time let's run it down hallelujah abraham was types out god the father eliezer types out brother branham amen hallelujah isaac types out jesus christ rebecca types out who i hope you going to the well tonight i and this woman was so special when she went out there hurry but jason she took the water pot not even realizing she's fulfilling the vision hallelujah got the pot holly and the prophets just sit back watching what he spoke unveiled holy the mystery of christ unveiled wow hallelujah and it's just being unveiled right before his eyes hallelujah and she grabs the pot and the scripture says she made haste she wasn't dragging around she wasn't caught up in ladder to see her sit back cooling lost in the sauce but she was working hard cause the scripture says his wife has made herself ready oh my church and then this is what i love she was so in tune to that vision she wasn't looking at how hard the journey was she wasn't looking at how hard the next step was she just stepped into it as soon as she finished with him she moved into the camel ministry i hope y'all understand you got a camel ministry hallelujah cause he said that power that she gave water to with that same power that was going to take her to her lord i hope you understand you got academy a camel ministry and that ministry is a ministry of strength hallelujah churches she gets down there and she gives them water holly now let's make it plain holly holly you know what sister watkins one camel can drink 20 gallons of water so she went to one i know she wasn't carrying 20 gallons of water so she kept making trips until the camel was satisfied but let me show you how special she was that's why i like reading about joshua he says be strong and of a good courage that's who this bride is she's strong enough of a good courage church hallelujah she gave that camel what he wanted 20 gallons but what made her so special there were nine more [Music] so that day she issued out 200 gallons of water that's how she was built earlier she was built to fulfill the strength of the word honey she was built in such a way that she wouldn't get depleted at the task she would overcome her now just to show how powerful that is sisters when was the last time you went to walmart and bought 200 gallons of milk you know what that'll be you have to come get your husband truck get your minivan and then tell them hold up we'll be back better yet just bring the truck to my house next time church he had 10 camels with him and she gave all fulfilled the vision hurley that's how he knew who she was be thou strong and very courageous anyway i'm in anthony probably watching so i did that for them amen oh that's the lewis amen praise god church look the strength of this end time bride she's gonna fulfill this word but she ain't gonna be no weakling that she doing it it's gonna be a part of who she is she's just gonna step into the vision and work it out she gonna step into the vision and work it out we got a song we sing jesus we'll work it out jesus we'll work it out to jesus and you will work it out hallelujah that problem that i had work it out i just couldn't see the saw work it out oh my i got i got to quit bro jason i'm feeling too good i'm feeling too good church prophecy will or already has been fulfilled now i say that to say this that there are some things spoken about us that still got to go there's a forecast and it says hallelujah let's make a real play there's a forecast that says when she holly can recognize the enemy working within the framework of the church holly she'll realize who she is she'll become a super church invincible homie holly that's who we are holly since as we're nearing the headstone we're in that time church if six have already been filled and seven is just a matter of pushing a button you know how close 7 is everybody got atomic weapons everybody it can happen at any moment you just better make sure you know i started to call this message tonight the bumper sticker i started to call it the bumper sticker because everybody used to ride around that bubble sticker jesus is coming are you ready hallelujah i might preach it someplace else and call it the bumble stick but you know it's gonna be a whole different inspiration but church there's a lot of things that have been fulfilled and are being fulfilled holy listen i'm a fulfillment of prophecy you're a fulfillment of prophecy holy you know you're mad you know you're fulfilled with the prophecy amen the watkins boys you're fulfilling the prophecy let me let me give you a prophecy that was fulfilled in your life he said the holy ghost is unto you and unto your children this day see

for this church tonight hallelujah and god knew it was gonna be here god knew he was gonna stream god knew who was gonna say amen god knows who's gonna catch it now don't take a message like this and go back to your old life no find your place let me say it again catch up to yourself i'ma preach that someplace too holy let's pray hallelujah hallelujah play that play that play that um that's

so glad tonight my eyes have been opened by the lord jesus are you glad are we at church that could say lord i'm thankful for eyes that can see thankful for ears i can hear thankful lord that you didn't just come and send a word and didn't just hear it with my physical ears or see it with my own eyes might not even have been in the meetings we weren't none of us except for my grandmother here tonight that i think would be the only one who were there physically to see it never with my own eyes never with my own ears but i heard a voice that voice contacted way beyond my ear way beyond in my intelligence and it went down and struck a seed that god put there before the foundation of the world and i'm here today because god sent a voice oh you ought to give god a hand clap of praise just for that hallelujah amen hallelujah we ought never to take that for granted amen i think we do sometimes but i think we ought to never take that for granted that the lord sent us a vindicated voice so that we wouldn't be in confusion we wouldn't there wouldn't be distortions and maybe this and maybe that but god sent a clear word a more sure word of prophecy you know when jesus said whom who who did you out to see speaking of john brother diggs you spoke on there and and jesus says who did you go out to see uh you know a reed shaken in the wind a prophet a prophet jesus said yea and i say unto you more than a prophet you know why jesus said john was more than just a prophet because prophets had prophesied prophets had given prophecy jeremiah was a prophet amos was a prophet named micah had we had prophets before but there were two there was one main reason why john was more than a prophet because there was a word spoken about john a prophecy about john and john was ju not just a prophet but john was the word that prophecy made flesh and jesus says behold i say unto you that there's never been a man born of a woman greater than john and my my goodness john what did he do he stood in between a dispensation of law and welcomed the dispensation of grace friend let me just be plain we received more than just a prophet brother branham was just more he was more than just a prophet he was an angel messenger who the bible spoke of and we've received that word this word made flesh came with a vindicated melchizedek sign what did we receive in this generation it was the a son of man revealing the son of man amen i'm glad that my eyes have seen that i've heard more than just stories and good stories and good preaching people hear good preaching we heard it brother branham had a lot of a lot of good stories a lot of good hunting stories a lot of good preaching but i heard more than just a sermon i heard my my i heard uh brother dick spoke on rebecca and isaac i heard mine hey man i heard my voice i i seen my name identified in rebecca and i'm watering that word brother branham said that camel brother diggs preached it was that beast that was going to lead her to horizons and brother branham said what do you do you water this word just like she watered that camel you water this word with your praise with your faith with your prayers i say lord let me water it how many could say lord let me water this word this power that you've sent to take me into a rapture amen thank you amen thank you brother diggs that was so wonderful amen we have some prayer requests i'm just looking for if any came in making sure don't miss any did you send them okay good amen we're going to have just an update also from brother donald this is from brother mark who sent
