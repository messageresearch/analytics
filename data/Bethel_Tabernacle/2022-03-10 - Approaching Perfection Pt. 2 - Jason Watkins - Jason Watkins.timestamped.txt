[11:47] i've heard a little bit about people
[11:48] can't hear me when i'm praying and stuff
[11:50] something
[11:51] anyway
[11:52] uh there's a request that was sent to me
[11:55] for kevin keith at happy valley
[11:58] he's uh having some heart issues with
[12:00] his electrical and it's a little too
[12:02] deep for them to go in and try to
[12:04] recharge it or reset it
[12:06] so we just want to pray for him that
[12:08] lord will
[12:10] go in
[12:11] and reset it it's not too deep for him
[12:15] you know i was just going to um
[12:17] you know a lot of people don't know
[12:18] about
[12:19] my past at all some you know you've been
[12:21] in a message church forever i was not
[12:24] raised in a message church
[12:26] i was a good irish catholic
[12:28] and not so much the catholic more the
[12:30] irish the drinking kind
[12:33] and i joined the military
[12:35] knew nothing about church or nothing
[12:40] and i just started to get a little
[12:42] anxious about getting out of the service
[12:44] because i didn't have anybody to pay my
[12:46] room and board
[12:47] i would have to take care of myself i
[12:49] was 22 years
[12:50] old so i went to madagan
[12:55] and i went to a
[12:56] charismatic church
[12:59] for four sundays
[13:01] and on the fourth sunday
[13:03] sitting there
[13:06] and
[13:07] the man asked it was a charismatic
[13:08] church and i like this it was called the
[13:10] eagle's nest
[13:13] and i was just sitting there and
[13:14] everybody bowed their heads and if you
[13:16] want to give your heart to jesus
[13:19] but as i was sitting there
[13:22] it just felt like he was
[13:24] sitting there looking at me i wasn't
[13:26] looking at anybody else i was just a
[13:29] marine
[13:30] party animal
[13:32] type of
[13:32] thing
[13:34] and
[13:35] i just knew
[13:37] he was watching me
[13:39] and i just decided
[13:41] yes i'll serve him
[13:43] so then it was everybody had to sit up
[13:46] and all you that raised your hand
[13:48] come on up front
[13:50] well between me and him i knew the
[13:53] decision that i decided
[13:55] by his grace to make
[13:57] and i went up front
[13:58] i was the first one a big clap
[14:01] i never went back to that church again
[14:04] soon after that i met some marine
[14:05] brothers that were
[14:07] going to tucson tabernacle
[14:10] but from that moment on we sang that
[14:12] song he touched me
[14:14] my life has never been the same
[14:17] i've never gone
[14:19] away from god i've i've had issues
[14:21] backslid or just not serve them like i
[14:24] could had a
[14:25] troubled church past
[14:27] where we
[14:28] were but from that moment on
[14:32] it was a decision
[14:34] he honored my decision
[14:36] and he never let me
[14:38] slip away
[14:40] it can be that easy
[14:42] you know just a moment in time
[14:45] and and i'm 61 that was 22 39 years ago
[14:50] and
[14:50] it stuck with me ever since
[14:53] and he has kept me ever since

[33:24] you love the lord
[33:26] god bless you this evening greece in the
[33:28] name of the lord i want to go right into
[33:30] the word of god
[33:32] to first timothy chapter 6 and i just
[33:34] want to say how much i appreciate it
[33:37] uh all of that singing and those
[33:39] specials were particularly
[33:42] wonderful for me both of them for
[33:44] personal reasons and i just
[33:46] um
[33:47] boy i was just an
[33:49] almost
[33:50] raptured
[33:52] amen it's amazing when you hear the lord
[33:55] talk to you in song and
[33:58] and the word and
[34:00] you know for me
[34:02] the way i'm built i suppose
[34:04] um
[34:05] i i have such a confidence in god's word
[34:10] since a child
[34:11] that for me
[34:13] the greatest thing god can ever
[34:16] ever do for me when he wants to tell me
[34:18] something is show it to me in his word
[34:21] because then as i have perfect faith
[34:23] there's
[34:24] no doubt i have i i would face uh
[34:28] i would face a thousand
[34:30] man army to take a stand by myself
[34:33] because i know
[34:34] that this is god's word
[34:36] and i know that god has sent us
[34:39] the opening of this word in the hour
[34:42] that we live and i have a 100 percent
[34:46] confidence in god's word
[34:48] amen and so i realize that no man can
[34:52] know this book takes the spirit to
[34:54] reveal it
[34:56] it took god
[34:57] anointing a messenger to open this word
[35:00] to us friends and make it live because
[35:02] that's really what its purpose is as
[35:05] i've been saying to you a lot of late
[35:08] that the goal of this book
[35:10] is to not need this book
[35:15] not not in this life you're going to
[35:16] need that you're going to need this book
[35:17] until you go
[35:19] but he's not rapturing this he's
[35:21] rapturing you
[35:22] because you are becoming this in flesh
[35:25] form amen don't get me wrong we need
[35:28] this absolutely until the lord calls us
[35:30] home every day when i go into this book
[35:33] i find new insight
[35:35] and things that i had not put together
[35:37] previously
[35:38] so i just stand here before you today
[35:41] exceptionally grateful to the lord for
[35:43] the word that he has given us in this
[35:45] day
[35:46] amen it is life to me it's all i care
[35:49] about
[35:49] amen in this world i have forsaken
[35:52] all other pursuits i realize that
[35:55] nothing

[36:18] uh a new one amen who's builder
[36:22] and maker is god amen imagine that a

[36:56] scripture done and then you go straight
[36:57] to my to the um
[37:00] title screen i think i said slide 14 i
[37:03] believe in the email
[37:05] that's where we're going to need to
[37:06] start
[37:06] first timothy chapter 6 verse 9 amen
[37:10] but they that will be rich fall into
[37:13] temptation and a snare
[37:16] and into many
[37:17] foolish and hurtful lusts
[37:20] which drowned men
[37:22] in destruction
[37:24] and perdition you'd read that verse you
[37:26] think nobody would chase this world's
[37:28] riches
[37:29] but almost everybody does
[37:31] it seems like i said some years ago
[37:34] said it seems like everybody wants to be
[37:36] the thing jesus said would be almost
[37:37] impossible to go to heaven
[37:40] amen
[37:40] but i'm i want to broaden your mind
[37:42] tonight we're
[37:44] we're going to be talking a lot more
[37:45] than about a lot more than the almighty
[37:47] dollar
[37:49] for the love of money is the root of all
[37:51] evil
[37:53] which while some coveted after they have
[37:55] erred from the faith
[37:57] and pierced themselves through
[38:00] with many sorrows
[38:03] but thou o man of god
[38:05] flee these things and follow after
[38:09] righteousness
[38:10] godliness
[38:12] faith
[38:13] love
[38:14] patience meekness
[38:16] fight the good fight of faith
[38:18] lay i mean listen at this list
[38:22] i i think that if you if you look at
[38:24] verses 11 and 12
[38:26] you realize that the principle the
[38:29] apostle is laying down is way more than
[38:31] just currency and money
[38:34] amen it's the pursuit of the world and
[38:37] all things attached to it and paul is
[38:39] just using this one example worldly
[38:42] riches that's one example but he's
[38:45] contrasting it with a a whole
[38:48] litany of of of things to that you
[38:51] should pursue
[38:53] he says fight the good fight of faith
[38:56] lay hold in that amazing lay hold on
[38:59] eternal life i thought i had it already
[39:01] but you've got to lay hold on it see all
[39:03] right whereunto
[39:05] thou art also called and has professed a
[39:09] good profession before many witnesses so
[39:13] god is not going to be satisfied for you
[39:16] just to have your eternal life and rest
[39:18] on your laurels
[39:20] that god has given you that eternal life
[39:22] to maximize
[39:24] its effect in your life
[39:26] amen your he he your your eternal life
[39:30] want to say that again
[39:31] is the source by which god is looking
[39:34] for excellence in you
[39:36] in in all things in godliness in
[39:40] righteousness in faith in love in
[39:44] meekness uh fighting the good fight of
[39:46] faith laying hold on eternal life this
[39:48] is what your eternal life is the fuel
[39:51] for
[39:52] you see to to pursue all of this list
[39:56] at the expense of chasing the world i
[39:59] want to tell you today you'll have a
[40:01] much better deal if you chase this
[40:04] and stop chasing the world
[40:07] amen you have a much better life you'll
[40:09] accomplish so much more for god you have
[40:12] you'll have so much more joy peace and
[40:14] happiness and contentment and the devil
[40:16] hates you more and that's an awesome
[40:19] thing

[41:22] okay
[41:25] so we are in
[41:27] approaching perfection part two
[41:30] and i want to just pick up two quotes
[41:32] that we took from sunday because we're
[41:34] carrying on in this theme tonight and if
[41:36] you remember sunday we were speaking a
[41:39] lot about the type that melchizedek uh
[41:43] king of salem a man priest of the most
[41:45] high god and uh how what his life was
[41:49] pretending for you and i it was a type
[41:52] it was it was something that god wasn't
[41:55] going to stay right there god was going
[41:57] to continue to unfold and remember you
[42:00] don't hear any more about him because he
[42:02] advanced he became jesus christ amen and
[42:06] jesus advanced
[42:09] he advanced
[42:10] oh absolutely he became for he went from
[42:13] one to 120 in a moment
[42:16] and then he went from 120 to 4 thousand
[42:19] and then he went from there and from
[42:20] there and from there and they went house
[42:22] to house and throughout all the world
[42:23] and here we are today the continuation
[42:26] of the advancement of god's unfolding
[42:29] amen
[42:30] i know it's wednesday but i hope you
[42:32] came ready all right
[42:34] here's something we read god in morphe
[42:37] masked in the pillar of fire god in more
[42:39] faith now look this is this is the
[42:41] advancement this is the going forward
[42:43] i'm referring to god in more faith
[42:45] masking the pillar of fire amen above
[42:48] above the children of israel fire by day
[42:51] amen cloud by night right
[42:55] god in morphe and a man called jesus
[42:58] that's an advance right god in morphe in
[43:01] his
[43:03] that's in advance you see
[43:05] god above us god with us god in us the
[43:09] condescending of god
[43:11] all right now since god doesn't do
[43:13] anything without a purpose then you have
[43:16] to admit he's in you for a purpose
[43:19] amen
[43:20] all right and that's what the bible has
[43:22] been it has been a work of god
[43:25] that's been covered up and it's been hid
[43:28] since the foundation of the world and
[43:30] its seven-fold mystery and god promised
[43:33] in this day
[43:34] at the age of this laodicean church
[43:37] he would take the mask off the whole
[43:40] thing and we could see it what a
[43:42] glorious thing now
[43:44] now let me let me just speak about this
[43:48] quote all right
[43:50] there is there is nothing in this quote
[43:53] or any quote
[43:55] to to suggest
[43:57] that our understanding is
[44:00] or will ever be greater than elijah of
[44:03] our day
[44:05] and there is nothing in this quote or
[44:08] any quote to suggest that the elijah of
[44:11] our day had a greater understanding of
[44:15] god than saint paul
[44:18] i defy that that notion there is no such
[44:21] thing there is not a doctrine that we
[44:24] believe
[44:25] that is not based on the foundation
[44:28] paul's laid
[44:30] clearly there's nothing you can find
[44:31] william branham teaching that's not
[44:33] established in paul's doctrine and
[44:35] that's what he stood on on the other
[44:37] side saying i only ever said what paul
[44:40] said and the millions said we're resting
[44:43] on that
[44:44] amen now
[44:46] all right now granted
[44:49] granted
[44:50] this at the family of god
[44:53] is is predestinated to go further in our
[44:58] development than that alpha age did
[45:00] because paul was moving them toward a
[45:04] body change they never got there
[45:06] they fell away that's what seven
[45:09] mysteries are all about they fell away
[45:11] it went into the ages christ can't come
[45:13] back in that age to get his bride he has
[45:16] to sit down in the eternities intercede
[45:18] for ignorance seal up the word in seven
[45:21] seals but he promised in the last day he
[45:24] would unseal it all and he would bring
[45:26] back the message of the hour and the
[45:28] bride would start feeding on that and he
[45:31] clips that first age all the way to a
[45:34] body change you say my goodness we they
[45:36] had such a book of acts we don't see
[45:38] seem to see that i'm here to tell you
[45:40] friends don't put god in that kind of a
[45:42] box just because you don't think you
[45:44] have a certain kind of a thing happening
[45:46] or this kind of thing happening i'm here
[45:47] to tell you this is the bride that's
[45:50] going to be changed in the body we're
[45:52] going to while we're alive without dying
[45:55] amen
[45:57] you understand
[45:59] so the word of god is is is
[46:03] is already
[46:05] doing
[46:06] more in you
[46:08] right now than you're even aware of amen
[46:13] say why do you say that so often because
[46:15] you need to have confidence in that
[46:19] that god because this age more than any
[46:23] other age uh before or since
[46:26] uh has the ability to discourage this
[46:30] bride to say why do i even try i have
[46:33] just so many weaknesses and so many
[46:35] failures well let me tell you something
[46:37] let me give you a little bit of help
[46:38] with that you've got you've only got the
[46:40] same weaknesses and failures that every
[46:42] age had only you're living in an age
[46:45] that's about a million times worse
[46:48] so give yourself a little bit of slack
[46:50] here and to say by his grace
[46:53] i am what i am and he's living in me and
[46:56] he's moving in my life and i'm going to
[46:58] keep pressing on because i know that
[47:01] some morning the trumpet of god will
[47:03] sound the dead in christ will rise and i
[47:06] will be changed in a moment in the
[47:10] twinkling of an eye
[47:12] take that devil
[47:17] hallelujah
[47:19] so
[47:20] we are
[47:22] there is that sense of we are further
[47:24] than they were
[47:26] just don't try to get it to where
[47:28] you where you're suggesting because
[47:31] that's the error that that has been in
[47:34] the within our ranks where oh we we've
[47:37] got another rung on the ladder we're
[47:39] we're higher where i've had preachers
[47:41] look me in the eye when i when they
[47:44] brought a doctrine that contradicted
[47:46] what brother branham taught in 1965
[47:50] and they says well when he when i when
[47:52] he couldn't wiggle out
[47:54] because i don't i don't
[47:56] confront someone unless i know where i'm
[47:58] standing
[47:59] and when i confront you understand i
[48:02] come loaded
[48:04] and when i confronted him and he had
[48:06] nowhere to move left right over under he
[48:09] looked me dead in the eye and said
[48:10] brother we are further along than
[48:12] william branham i said we are done
[48:16] we are done
[48:17] there is no need to have any more
[48:19] discussion right we can still be pals
[48:22] but we are finished in this discussion
[48:25] there's nothing else for me to say if
[48:27] that's what you believe god bless you
[48:29] but i will never accept that i i
[48:32] certainly believe i am lacking in
[48:35] manifestation but you're not gonna tell
[48:37] me that this message isn't complete
[48:40] you're not gonna tell me that a prophet
[48:42] didn't finish his course
[48:45] and i have everything that i need in
[48:48] this hour in order to bring a seed gene
[48:51] to god and bring it forward to a body
[48:53] change
[48:55] i don't need an eighth messenger
[48:58] i don't need another super
[49:01] we're not to chase supers
[49:04] see we have we have a message and and
[49:07] you know it's amazing to me that
[49:09] everybody wants to go beyond it nobody's
[49:11] even
[49:12] acknowledging what god has done
[49:15] the ones that always want to go beyond
[49:16] it that's the the one thing i see about
[49:19] them constantly
[49:20] and very often times
[49:24] they have the
[49:26] teachings of william branham but they
[49:27] don't even have the same spirit william
[49:29] branham had
[49:31] and so i want something that lives
[49:33] friends i'm not i'm not impressed at all
[49:35] by high octane preaching that that'll
[49:37] entertain me for about 10 or 15 minutes
[49:39] but if you ain't got something to say
[49:41] and if i can't see the power of god
[49:43] moving i'm here to tell you i'm looking
[49:45] for another source because i believe
[49:47] this word has power in it
[49:50] hallelujah i believe it it can change
[49:52] the hearts of people and not just puff
[49:54] us up with pride and knowledge
[49:57] make us message theologians
[50:03] back to my notes
[50:08] when we look at
[50:10] um
[50:14] at these verses
[50:18] i i think that with the wickedness seen
[50:20] in the
[50:22] you know in the repeating of the days of
[50:23] noah
[50:25] and the days of sodom
[50:27] you know
[50:28] pressing on the door
[50:31] as it were like they did
[50:33] there in genesis they were pushing and
[50:35] pressing on the door
[50:37] and we find that that's the spirit of
[50:40] that sodom spirit today it literally
[50:42] wants to press its way into the schools
[50:44] and press its way into the government
[50:46] press its way into your home
[50:48] press its way into how your children are
[50:50] taught
[50:51] press its way into churches and liberal
[50:55] all-inclusive thinking that that does
[50:58] away with the line of demarcation that
[51:00] god clearly puts between his family and
[51:03] everybody else
[51:05] god doesn't divide on racial lines he
[51:07] doesn't divide on economic lines but god
[51:09] does divide on the line of his word
[51:14] hallelujah and and and we are a separate
[51:17] people not because we're better or made
[51:20] ourselves separate but because we have
[51:22] we have been called out if it's not a
[51:25] separating message why call out of her
[51:27] my people
[51:29] why not just stay in there and be
[51:31] ecumenical
[51:33] see
[51:34] that's much more politically correct
[51:36] ecumenic ecumenicalism is much more
[51:38] politically correct
[51:40] but it's also the mark of the beast
[51:44] that's why it's going to fool so many
[51:47] but i think friends that you would agree
[51:49] with me
[51:51] tonight that
[51:53] with the days of knowing the days of
[51:55] sodom that we see
[51:57] pressing upon our everyday life there's
[52:00] there's never been a time
[52:02] for the family of god
[52:05] uh where
[52:06] verses 9 and 10
[52:09] have a more
[52:11] um
[52:12] imposing
[52:14] reality
[52:15] an imposing
[52:17] reality
[52:18] that that the whole world is just
[52:21] you know the love of money and the root
[52:23] of evil and men are drowning in
[52:25] perdition and and snares of the enemy
[52:28] and foolish and lustful
[52:30] hurtful lust
[52:32] abound and there's every kind of thing
[52:35] there's every kind you say i don't
[52:37] really have a pursuit to be rich
[52:39] you think the devil don't know exactly
[52:41] what you have a pursuit of and i'm here
[52:43] to tell you
[52:44] everything other than this he is trying
[52:46] to give you that and block this
[52:49] i want you to understand young people
[52:51] the devil has been watching you since
[52:53] the day you were born he knows what he
[52:56] knows what buttons to push he knows how
[52:58] you tick he knows what your goals are
[53:00] and what will turn you on and he will do
[53:03] anything he can to keep the pursuit of
[53:06] this
[53:07] out of your life
[53:11] and you'll find yourself
[53:13] with these men
[53:15] of verse 9
[53:17] who drown
[53:19] in destruction
[53:21] and perdition
[53:24] one of the
[53:25] leading causes of spiritual death is
[53:29] drowning
[53:33] in destruction and perdition
[53:36] when i look at verse
[53:39] 11 to 12
[53:41] you know conversely the bride then
[53:44] in contrast to
[53:46] nine and ten the bride has never seen
[53:49] i would suggest you tonight that we have
[53:52] this bride as a collective global body
[53:55] has never seen the necessity of verse 11
[53:59] and 12
[54:00] become more important
[54:03] but thou
[54:04] o man of god
[54:06] flee
[54:06] these things
[54:08] and don't just flee
[54:11] follow after
[54:13] righteousness it's not just well i just
[54:16] won't do anything evil
[54:18] you will if you don't pursue
[54:19] righteousness
[54:21] you you turn on a treadmill one time and
[54:23] step on it and don't walk
[54:28] the world is sliding off a cliff and if
[54:30] you stop going forward you go backwards
[54:34] if you're just standing still say i'm a
[54:36] pretty good guy i'm not in all kinds of
[54:38] stuff but if you're standing still in
[54:40] your spirituality if you've allowed leo
[54:41] to see it to arrest your advance and
[54:44] spirituality you're going backwards
[54:47] see
[54:48] and you won't you might not notice it
[54:49] till you flip on the when you go off the
[54:51] end of it see
[54:54] so we've never seen something more
[54:55] important as
[54:57] fleeing these things and following after
[54:59] righteousness godliness faith love
[55:01] patience meekness following after these
[55:05] things see
[55:06] fight the good fight of faith lay hold
[55:10] on eternal life you know there's
[55:12] something to be said and i i said it i
[55:15] read you the quote in fact i don't have
[55:16] it tonight just trying to cut as much
[55:18] out as i could to save some time
[55:21] but i i read you a quote where brother
[55:23] branham was talking about too often
[55:25] times you know we we want god to just
[55:28] make us into the perfect person we
[55:29] loathe ourselves and we just want god to
[55:31] fix us
[55:32] see
[55:33] and and and brother branham has said
[55:35] there's some things he will not do he's
[55:39] waiting on you to do it
[55:42] see here's some of them
[55:44] fight the good fight of faith
[55:47] lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou
[55:51] art called
[55:52] and has professed a good profession
[55:54] before many witnesses in other words
[55:56] lay hold on eternal life to the level
[55:59] that god predestinated you to lay hold
[56:02] on eternal life to the level that that
[56:05] you have the potential to be down on the
[56:08] inside of you this is an age for
[56:10] excellence the bible says in the last
[56:11] days the people that know their god will
[56:14] do great exploits
[56:16] see
[56:19] it's amazing that this term
[56:22] o man of god it's interesting you don't
[56:25] find that you'll find it only in the old
[56:27] testament actually this is the only time
[56:30] in the new testament that it's carried
[56:32] over and and it's used only right here
[56:34] in in timothy in the new testament
[56:36] because the title describes one who
[56:38] stands for god faithfully
[56:41] against opposition
[56:43] as a spiritual leader or as an example
[56:46] to all believers now this is including
[56:47] all of us because we're all whether
[56:50] you're in a spiritual leadership role
[56:52] you're all an example to the world amen
[56:55] you're an example to one another an
[56:56] example to your family and therefore
[56:59] this man of god term is applying to all
[57:02] of us paul's not just saying
[57:04] timothy i need you to do these things
[57:06] but hey you people in buford 2000 years
[57:08] from now you don't need to worry about
[57:10] it this is just for timothy
[57:14] no no
[57:16] see
[57:17] and so we find that the the spirit is
[57:20] speaking expressly then through saint
[57:22] paul
[57:24] to connect the shadow in the old
[57:26] testament
[57:28] of
[57:29] thou mann of god
[57:32] to a as i've been saying since i started
[57:35] to an advancement to a further
[57:38] fulfillment
[57:40] when you look in the old testament
[57:41] everything you see is shadow you
[57:43] understand it
[57:44] the very fact that it was shadow
[57:47] then
[57:48] says to you it will have a fulfillment
[57:50] because if there was no deep to respond
[57:54] there would be no deep to call you
[57:56] understand so the very fact that he in
[57:59] the old testament he used the term man
[58:01] of god proves there's going to be people
[58:04] of god
[58:05] not not just a man man-made prophet like
[58:08] elijah moses going through the
[58:09] wilderness but all the people all of
[58:12] them will have the spirit of god
[58:13] dwelling down inside of them
[58:16] amen
[58:19] now
[58:21] so we find then that
[58:24] that when he calls him
[58:27] oh man of god you know it's it reminds
[58:30] me of
[58:31] when we preached on the series you know
[58:33] what is the church of god i've had so
[58:35] much feedback on that series it's a
[58:37] lengthy series longer than most
[58:40] and you know it's it's it's like it much
[58:43] in the same way
[58:44] that paul is saying to timothy oh thou
[58:47] man of god almost like to me it's like
[58:49] paul when he said to the corinthian
[58:51] church that that they were the church of
[58:54] god
[58:55] i mean you know hear this bethel
[58:57] tabernacle you are part of the church of
[59:00] god
[59:01] let me remind you of that lest you have
[59:04] forgotten already you are part of the
[59:06] church of god
[59:08] hallelujah that that that that must put
[59:10] a responsibility upon us
[59:14] see
[59:16] so
[59:17] you want to let that be more
[59:20] than a denominational idea
[59:23] to you see otherwise i mean if you if
[59:26] you don't
[59:28] if if if i say to you bethel tabernacle
[59:33] you are part of the church of god
[59:36] and that really
[59:37] to you is just a title
[59:39] a cliche
[59:41] i mean it's it's just a uh uh i'm not
[59:44] saying you think that we're denomination
[59:46] but
[59:46] denominationalism is a is an idea it's a
[59:49] way of thinking
[59:50] and as long as it's you know it's just
[59:52] some kind of man-made you know we've got
[59:55] this title where bethel tabernacle paul
[59:57] called us the church of god if
[1:00:00] if if to you that it's not more than
[1:00:03] just a denominational idea then then you
[1:00:05] literally take
[1:00:07] this gospel that jesus said when this
[1:00:10] gospel is preached into all the world
[1:00:12] and what was that this gospel
[1:00:14] what was that this gospel the word made
[1:00:16] flesh
[1:00:18] the word made flesh that's the gospel he
[1:00:20] was referring to so no wonder it had to
[1:00:22] come at the last day of the ministry of
[1:00:24] the son of man under 21st century
[1:00:26] ability to take and live in people's
[1:00:29] lives around the globe and this gospel
[1:00:31] is being repeated the word made flesh in
[1:00:34] people's lives
[1:00:36] but when you look at it as just
[1:00:38] knowledge or education or a church
[1:00:41] that's just where i go then that's just
[1:00:43] a denominational idea of thinking and
[1:00:45] you literally you you you literally make
[1:00:48] this the the gospel of this word made
[1:00:51] flesh you make it into a man-made thing
[1:00:55] see
[1:00:57] this is why we are told
[1:01:01] paul said to the hebrews in the 12th
[1:01:03] chapter looking unto jesus
[1:01:07] catch catch the
[1:01:08] description he's the author
[1:01:11] and the finisher
[1:01:13] see
[1:01:14] of our faith so
[1:01:16] so it so
[1:01:18] he's the author
[1:01:20] and the finisher what he was in the
[1:01:22] first age he's finishing that way
[1:01:26] that's what the message is about friends
[1:01:28] that that's exactly what we have come to
[1:01:30] in this hour is that that gospel is now
[1:01:34] this gospel
[1:01:35] and he's the author and the finisher
[1:01:38] you're living in the hour of the
[1:01:40] finisher
[1:01:41] see
[1:01:43] and so all his word then is to be on
[1:01:46] display
[1:01:48] in the last day
[1:01:50] like the first day
[1:01:52] that's why they wrote a book of acts
[1:01:54] and brother baton said
[1:01:55] when this
[1:01:57] bride when this bride tree puts forth
[1:01:58] another branch it'll write another book
[1:02:00] of acts behind it bear in mind that the
[1:02:02] chronicles you read in in the book of
[1:02:04] acts
[1:02:05] i mean the book of acts was written
[1:02:08] because people acted
[1:02:11] amen
[1:02:12] you understand
[1:02:14] it became a chronicle of events it's not
[1:02:17] a book the doctrine though it teaches
[1:02:19] doctrine but the book of acts was
[1:02:22] written because people acted and that's
[1:02:24] exactly what's incumbent upon us today
[1:02:26] we're here acting out the finishing part
[1:02:30] to prove to the world that he is he
[1:02:32] really is no kidding the same yesterday
[1:02:35] today and forever and we can prove it
[1:02:39] because he lives in our lives and
[1:02:41] conducts himself the same way in us as
[1:02:43] he did the early church see and so so
[1:02:46] then we come to this
[1:02:49] so here i i highlighted these
[1:02:51] because these are action words but thou
[1:02:54] o man of god
[1:02:56] flee
[1:02:58] amen
[1:02:59] flee
[1:03:00] these things and follow after
[1:03:03] and fight the good fight and lay hold
[1:03:07] which one of these words do you read
[1:03:09] vacation
[1:03:15] are these passive words or active words
[1:03:18] they're active words
[1:03:20] because perfect faith is active not
[1:03:22] passive
[1:03:23] you understand it's taking god at his
[1:03:24] word and going forward
[1:03:26] see because perfect faith has to become
[1:03:28] manifested it's not just a human faith
[1:03:31] but we've had that you do have that but
[1:03:33] brother and son i'm trying to bring you
[1:03:34] a perfect faith this is a revealed faith
[1:03:37] that causes you to move causes you to
[1:03:39] act upon it see because then because
[1:03:41] then it's a revelation so none of these
[1:03:44] are passive
[1:03:45] and if and if you're living your
[1:03:47] christian life passively
[1:03:49] i feel so sorry for you
[1:03:52] no wonder you don't have the victory
[1:03:54] that you see others have and want to
[1:03:56] have but think you can't have
[1:03:58] and you've got the same gene seed of god
[1:04:00] they've got and you serve the same
[1:04:02] master they serve and god loves you just
[1:04:04] as much as he loves them but why is it
[1:04:07] we we we have too much you know passive
[1:04:10] way about us i think i think when it
[1:04:12] comes to fighting the devil we're
[1:04:14] pacifist
[1:04:16] i'm a pacifist in the in spiritual
[1:04:20] warfare
[1:04:21] you're a pacifist you're gonna get
[1:04:23] killed
[1:04:25] your family's going to get killed
[1:04:28] everything around you is going to burn
[1:04:29] down and say why because the enemy will
[1:04:31] burn it down if you don't fight him
[1:04:34] you're going to have to take the land
[1:04:36] and you're going to have to defeat the
[1:04:37] enemy and you're going to have to hold
[1:04:39] the ground that god gives you
[1:04:41] and not back up this is not passive
[1:04:44] warfare god hasn't doesn't have an army
[1:04:46] full of pacifists we are hard charging
[1:04:49] soldiers of the cross we have no armor
[1:04:52] for our backside we have a shield of
[1:04:54] faith and a helmet of salvation and a
[1:04:56] sword of the spirit and a breastplate
[1:04:58] and feet shod with the preparation of
[1:05:00] the gospel and the sound is a battle cry
[1:05:02] charge
[1:05:05] see
[1:05:08] so it's all his word
[1:05:10] on display
[1:05:13] in these last days like it was the first
[1:05:14] day
[1:05:17] but in a great house
[1:05:19] there are not only vessels of gold and
[1:05:21] of silver
[1:05:23] but also of wood and of earth
[1:05:25] and some to honor
[1:05:27] and some to dishonor
[1:05:30] you ready
[1:05:33] if a man therefore
[1:05:36] wait for god to purge him
[1:05:41] from these
[1:05:43] he shall be a vessel unto honor
[1:05:45] how many want to be a vessel and honor
[1:05:47] well he's not promising you that god
[1:05:50] will purge him he's saying if a man
[1:05:52] therefore purge himself of these
[1:05:54] see he shall be a vessel unto honor
[1:05:58] sanctified
[1:05:59] and meet
[1:06:01] for the master's use
[1:06:04] lord god in heaven i have no other
[1:06:06] desire in my life than to be in use
[1:06:09] for the master
[1:06:11] hallelujah
[1:06:13] and prepared
[1:06:15] unto every good work all right
[1:06:19] so so but in a in a great house verse 20
[1:06:23] there are not only vessels of gold so so
[1:06:26] if a man therefore purge himself from
[1:06:28] these he shall be a vessel and honor
[1:06:29] sanctified and meet for the master's use
[1:06:31] and prepared under every good work
[1:06:33] flee
[1:06:34] there's an active word for you
[1:06:36] flee
[1:06:38] also youthful lust run
[1:06:41] why do i need to run because it's going
[1:06:42] to kill you
[1:06:44] it's poisonous
[1:06:45] and it'll work on your natural body and
[1:06:47] your mind and fill you full of so much
[1:06:49] stuff you'll find yourself captive to it
[1:06:53] see
[1:06:54] flee youthful lust
[1:07:02] you get me
[1:07:04] you get me
[1:07:05] you're with me i can feel that you're
[1:07:08] with me you're we're going in the same
[1:07:09] direction here
[1:07:11] flee also youthful us not pray for an
[1:07:14] overcoming magic spell
[1:07:17] but follow
[1:07:18] righteousness
[1:07:20] faith charity peace with them that call
[1:07:23] on the lord
[1:07:25] out of a pure
[1:07:27] heart
[1:07:30] to see the things
[1:07:34] the lord
[1:07:36] is doing among us can i just get a
[1:07:38] little personal tonight is that all
[1:07:39] right it's a wednesday night kind of
[1:07:40] open up my heart tell you how the lord's
[1:07:42] been dealing with me that'd be all right
[1:07:46] say brother jason what makes you tick
[1:07:47] i'm gonna just tell you a few things
[1:07:48] that make me tick
[1:07:51] you know to see the things the lord is
[1:07:53] doing among us and
[1:07:56] you know
[1:07:58] i mean
[1:08:00] just just if we speak in in human terms
[1:08:02] i mean growing our
[1:08:05] numbers of families
[1:08:07] and this
[1:08:08] assembly um that's one
[1:08:12] and don't think that that's not on my
[1:08:14] mind i i've even
[1:08:16] my my my ministry team and i
[1:08:19] have said you know we've got families
[1:08:21] we've already got new families and we've
[1:08:23] got more families coming and i'm going
[1:08:25] to tell you something brothers and you
[1:08:26] ask them i've told them i said we need
[1:08:28] to get ahead of this
[1:08:30] we need to be ahead of this because
[1:08:32] the enemy is not going to take that
[1:08:33] sitting down
[1:08:35] and we need to make sure we're working
[1:08:36] on the line and order of god's word have
[1:08:39] i said it brothers i've said it over and
[1:08:40] over brothers we're going to have to be
[1:08:42] ahead of this because because satan's
[1:08:44] not going to take it laying down and
[1:08:45] we're going to have to make sure that we
[1:08:47] can stand on the promises of god
[1:08:50] see
[1:08:51] and so you know we have we have all felt
[1:08:53] the tremendous anointing
[1:08:55] in our services our our fellowship i
[1:08:58] thought about some of these things today
[1:08:59] as i was just jotting down some thoughts
[1:09:01] from my mind our fellowship after the
[1:09:04] services the extended fellowship that we
[1:09:07] have in our homes i i saw some videos
[1:09:09] the other night and believers just
[1:09:11] sitting around strumming guitars and
[1:09:13] singing and worshiping you say oh yeah
[1:09:15] that's what we we do in a church they
[1:09:17] weren't in a church they were in a home
[1:09:19] and and you've got people gathering and
[1:09:22] praying and and you know the lord has
[1:09:24] been pouring out his spirit moving in
[1:09:26] our families amen bethel tabernacle
[1:09:28] moving in our families moving in our
[1:09:30] married couples moving upon the heart of
[1:09:32] our young people and our number of
[1:09:34] baptisms recently has been increasing
[1:09:37] and
[1:09:37] and and i and i can i can say to you
[1:09:40] personally that that i that i have felt
[1:09:42] a strong a strong or a surging strength
[1:09:47] and and strong tide like a like like a
[1:09:51] tide rolling in for the opening of the
[1:09:53] word i can't even stay abreast of it i
[1:09:55] can't even keep up i just sit in my
[1:09:57] office and my mind is blown every day
[1:09:59] every day every day i'm here to tell you
[1:10:02] god is gathering up his family
[1:10:04] hallelujah we're
[1:10:06] we're on the home stretch friends
[1:10:09] hallelujah
[1:10:11] amen
[1:10:12] all things trending upward and
[1:10:15] i felt so challenged in my spirit i just
[1:10:18] confessed to you
[1:10:19] when i see these things
[1:10:22] i i have
[1:10:24] i have felt so challenged in my spirit
[1:10:28] say brother jason almost seems like
[1:10:29] these things are stressing you out
[1:10:30] they're not stressing me out at all
[1:10:32] in fact as part of my dilemmas i'm i
[1:10:35] don't feel stressed and i wonder if i
[1:10:36] should
[1:10:39] i wonder i'm worried that i don't seem
[1:10:41] to have anything to worry about
[1:10:43] and that worries me
[1:10:47] we have plenty to worry about don't
[1:10:49] worry about that
[1:10:51] but just on a personal note as i see
[1:10:54] these things i have
[1:10:56] very recently you know over the last
[1:10:58] year or so i don't know maybe it was the
[1:11:00] thing that happened with the near-death
[1:11:02] experience
[1:11:04] you know fourth time in my life i came
[1:11:06] probably shouldn't be here
[1:11:08] enemy trying to take me out
[1:11:10] several times over my life
[1:11:12] and this most recent one was the fourth
[1:11:15] time
[1:11:16] but i'm still here
[1:11:18] and i'm gonna keep going
[1:11:20] and i know that until the lord is done
[1:11:22] with me i am immortal
[1:11:24] hallelujah but i i feel so challenged in
[1:11:28] my spirit say to what brother jason
[1:11:31] and it's hard to describe i spent all
[1:11:33] afternoon just staring at my screen
[1:11:35] trying to figure out how to say what's
[1:11:36] in my heart
[1:11:38] but but but the simplest way i can
[1:11:40] express it is just to
[1:11:43] feel a challenge in my spirit to to
[1:11:45] empty out more
[1:11:47] see
[1:11:48] two two you say well i thought i would
[1:11:50] think that you would want to start
[1:11:51] climbing spiritual well you have to
[1:11:53] empty first
[1:11:55] that's the problem you have to empty
[1:11:56] because he'll only be in you what you
[1:11:58] brother branham said what you empty out
[1:12:00] and make room for him and if you limped
[1:12:02] it out he'll come in and fill that space
[1:12:05] see but he's not going to live in an
[1:12:07] overcrowded cell he he he's going to
[1:12:10] have you empty out the world so that he
[1:12:12] can come in and fill that place back up
[1:12:15] again don't worry you won't be empty
[1:12:17] you'll just be full of better things
[1:12:20] hallelujah empty more of anything
[1:12:24] that even has a chance for satan to
[1:12:27] lessen my spiritual life
[1:12:32] and i suppose if i would have stress it
[1:12:34] would be that i don't seem to be
[1:12:39] keeping pace as fast as i feel like i
[1:12:41] want to
[1:12:42] does that make sense
[1:12:44] can i be just transparent with you
[1:12:46] tonight i'm just a man like you
[1:12:48] and i have i'm liking you know like
[1:12:50] we're all like elijah we have them we're
[1:12:52] men and like passions brother branham
[1:12:54] said that many had his ups and downs we
[1:12:56] have bright days and rainy days good
[1:12:58] days and bad days don't we friends
[1:13:01] we have days when you just feel like you
[1:13:03] feel like elijah's standing there
[1:13:05] calling down fire and then you feel like
[1:13:06] elijah hiding in a cave
[1:13:10] see
[1:13:12] but to empty out more
[1:13:14] and more of anything that even has
[1:13:17] a chance
[1:13:19] uh for satan to lessen
[1:13:22] somehow lessen or water down my
[1:13:24] spiritual life i have wondered
[1:13:27] you know at a recent seemingly
[1:13:30] strange thing seemingly it's not i found
[1:13:33] out it's not i found out it's actually
[1:13:35] part of the word perfectly but because i
[1:13:38] wasn't aware of that it seemed odd to me
[1:13:40] and i questioned whether it was even
[1:13:42] right
[1:13:43] and i went to the lord in prayer now you
[1:13:45] remember i gave you the testimony at the
[1:13:46] beginning of the service that for the
[1:13:48] lord to show me anything if he shows it
[1:13:49] to me in his word that for me that is
[1:13:52] that's a rest
[1:13:53] then i can just let off the pressure ah
[1:13:57] there it is in the word devil you lying
[1:14:00] dog it was in the word all the time
[1:14:02] you're trying to make me feel stressed
[1:14:04] and i didn't even need to feel stressed
[1:14:05] i had the word of god to assure me
[1:14:10] but i've wondered at a recent seemingly
[1:14:12] strange thing working in my life i've
[1:14:13] had a deepening question
[1:14:16] about feeling like perhaps i could be
[1:14:18] taking god for granted somehow and i
[1:14:21] you know i and i'll just the only way to
[1:14:23] do it is just to kind of give you some
[1:14:24] examples but you know last week was a
[1:14:26] very taxing week for me ministry-wise
[1:14:30] because i'm
[1:14:31] i i'm in a i'm in a call-in bible study
[1:14:34] every day 365 and i love it it's tiring
[1:14:37] and and sometimes at least once or twice
[1:14:40] a week i'm the lead teacher and then
[1:14:42] every other day i'm one of the lead
[1:14:44] commentators following up behind the
[1:14:46] teacher and so it's every morning and i
[1:14:48] i i revel in it i love it it's been one
[1:14:51] of the most enriching things in my life
[1:14:55] but you know i've i've and and so so
[1:14:58] come
[1:14:59] last week then turns out that that that
[1:15:02] some brothers in another church in
[1:15:05] another state
[1:15:06] uh where i was ministering and they
[1:15:08] asked me said brother jason you know we
[1:15:10] heard you do this thing every day i said
[1:15:12] yeah i said you know we meet every
[1:15:13] friday with a team of brothers and we
[1:15:16] sit around with coffee in our bibles and
[1:15:18] we have a little bible study and we're
[1:15:20] would you would you mind coming on and
[1:15:22] just you know have a have a little
[1:15:23] fellowship with us around i said sure
[1:15:25] absolutely i love studying preaching i
[1:15:27] love teaching the bible it's one of my
[1:15:28] favorite things in the world to do
[1:15:30] and i and i and so so consequently then
[1:15:34] i had i was scheduled to
[1:15:36] speak in my bible study that i'm on the
[1:15:38] call in it's national it's all the way
[1:15:41] to the west coast and even other places
[1:15:43] in the world and
[1:15:44] and so they i was scheduled for that
[1:15:46] friday to teach and so i quickly i
[1:15:48] jumped in i jumped in whatsapp and i
[1:15:49] said hey we have a team of brothers i
[1:15:51] said can anybody swap with me and i saw
[1:15:53] brother david samuel said hey brother
[1:15:55] david you're you're scheduled for sunday
[1:15:57] i'm scheduled for friday and saturday
[1:15:58] back to back by the tim put me back to
[1:16:00] back services and i said can i
[1:16:03] i'll handle sunday for you you take
[1:16:04] friday for me sure brother jason brother
[1:16:06] david gentlemen that he is be happy to
[1:16:08] do that brother and so
[1:16:10] he jumped in on friday there in my place
[1:16:12] while i was with these brothers at a
[1:16:14] another assembly out in the west and
[1:16:16] and and so i here i am you know in a
[1:16:19] lengthy bible study on friday and then i
[1:16:22] got to jump right up out of the gate
[1:16:24] saturday morning go right back into
[1:16:26] another call in bible study and then and
[1:16:29] then sunday i had a double header
[1:16:31] because i had to now cover brother
[1:16:33] david's sunday service and then leave
[1:16:36] there and rush to church and come here
[1:16:37] and preach to you
[1:16:39] and so by sunday afternoon i got home i
[1:16:42] told my wife i said my goodness i feel
[1:16:44] like i've run a four-day revival my mind
[1:16:46] is so tired and and she said you bet you
[1:16:49] love it and i said that you're right i
[1:16:50] do and i said i'm not complaining i said
[1:16:52] it's a good feel it's a good tired
[1:16:54] feeling but
[1:16:55] but i'll be honest with you you know
[1:16:56] when i when i came to church when i was
[1:16:59] coming and i i was just praying and said
[1:17:01] lord you know my mind by the time i
[1:17:03] finished three friday morning saturday
[1:17:06] morning sunday morning and now it's time
[1:17:07] to come here and preach my main sermon
[1:17:09] to you
[1:17:10] i felt very tired all i had plenty of
[1:17:12] notes i'd done tons of study i was
[1:17:14] totally ready to go i'm sure sunday
[1:17:16] reflected that
[1:17:17] but mentally i was very tired
[1:17:20] and i was just saying
[1:17:22] and i said in my heart i said but lord
[1:17:26] you know you just always come on the
[1:17:27] scene
[1:17:29] and i just don't have to worry because i
[1:17:31] just know you will
[1:17:34] and then i thought to myself ah there's
[1:17:36] that nagging feeling again you remember
[1:17:38] brother branham got a nagging feeling
[1:17:40] like that he couldn't figure out what
[1:17:41] it's coming from and he thought lord
[1:17:42] have i done something and he he went for
[1:17:44] a long time trying to figure it out and
[1:17:45] he prayed and that's where he went in
[1:17:47] you know and saw that deer and the lord
[1:17:49] said you kept you remembered your
[1:17:50] promise yes he said i'll keep my promise
[1:17:52] too it was a great deliverance for
[1:17:53] brother branham and it's been wearing on
[1:17:55] me because because my ministry schedule
[1:17:57] i'm ministering every day of my life and
[1:17:59] it can get so tiring but then i but then
[1:18:01] i sometimes i think to myself it's all
[1:18:04] right i'll be fine because even if i go
[1:18:06] in unprepared the lord will just come in
[1:18:08] on the scene and those are usually the
[1:18:10] best sermons and services is when i
[1:18:12] don't even hardly can't even figure out
[1:18:14] and i i was comforting myself because
[1:18:16] i'd i'd seen the message where brother
[1:18:18] brandon would say he'd come to the plot
[1:18:20] where he'd say
[1:18:22] well he said
[1:18:23] they they called for me to come out here
[1:18:25] and he said my goodness i haven't even
[1:18:27] opened my bible and he said and brother
[1:18:29] neville said brother brandon we'd love
[1:18:30] to have you taken they started singing
[1:18:32] he said so i just i just ran by and
[1:18:33] grabbed my bible and out the door i went
[1:18:35] he said and he said now he said i don't
[1:18:37] even know where to turn he said let's
[1:18:38] just start at john 1 1. he said let's
[1:18:40] just see what the lord will say
[1:18:43] and here's a prophet of the age
[1:18:45] that vulnerable but i'm glad he was he
[1:18:48] was transparent like that helps me
[1:18:52] but i i just felt like lord this is this
[1:18:54] this goes back to that whole thing again
[1:18:56] i'm not emptying out enough i'm i and
[1:18:58] and i'm and i'm always
[1:19:00] with that weakness of trying to say i
[1:19:02] want to do more and i want to do one i
[1:19:04] remember god keeps saying i just need
[1:19:05] you to be more i need you to be more you
[1:19:07] know don't don't just you do the be and
[1:19:10] i'll do the doing and i'm constantly
[1:19:11] having to correct myself on that because
[1:19:13] i have i'm caloric and that's my nature
[1:19:15] and i hard charge and and it's like i
[1:19:17] just got to take that's why i never
[1:19:19] could train people with with painting
[1:19:21] they just had to learn it
[1:19:22] by true by trick or hook or crook and
[1:19:26] and trial and error because i i'm trying
[1:19:28] to train somebody and say now just okay
[1:19:30] paint it i mean no no i mean
[1:19:33] stop give me that here just here go go
[1:19:36] go clean those brushes up i'll just do
[1:19:37] this
[1:19:40] and it's just too much ocd and
[1:19:43] and and so i'm i'm just always charging
[1:19:46] ahead hard like that and and so if the
[1:19:49] slightest little thing i i can fall
[1:19:51] under such conviction and say my
[1:19:52] goodness lord what am i what's more of
[1:19:54] my time
[1:19:55] and
[1:19:56] and i you know i and i and i
[1:19:59] you know i yet yet god
[1:20:01] you know yet god
[1:20:04] did as he always does
[1:20:07] every time listen friends if i said it
[1:20:09] any other way i'd be lying
[1:20:11] every time i come to the pulpit he's
[1:20:14] there
[1:20:15] whether i feel prepared unprepared he's
[1:20:18] there well i feel tired or fresh he's
[1:20:20] there
[1:20:21] whether i've even got problems i'm
[1:20:23] dealing with he's there you know why
[1:20:26] because this is his word and you're his
[1:20:28] bride and this is his plan
[1:20:32] and i'm constantly reminding myself i'm
[1:20:35] just his assistant it's not even on me
[1:20:37] and but you know just fighting that
[1:20:39] battle just fighting i'm just confessing
[1:20:41] and fighting that battle
[1:20:43] and it even happened over this last
[1:20:45] weekend but here he come
[1:20:48] and i went to sleep sunday night
[1:20:51] and i had that question in my mind lord
[1:20:53] am i just
[1:20:55] am i taking you for granted i mean it
[1:20:57] feels like i'm just taking you for
[1:20:58] granted
[1:21:00] i woke up monday morning is this okay
[1:21:04] i woke up monday morning
[1:21:06] and i had a good friend come on my mind
[1:21:08] brother mark coffey this brother barry's
[1:21:10] brother
[1:21:11] lives up in newfoundland i think and uh
[1:21:14] wonderful brother me and him have worked
[1:21:16] together on
[1:21:18] this whole study of the book of
[1:21:19] revelation that we're creating uh
[1:21:21] brother jd's helping me put together a
[1:21:24] um a study guide for the entire first by
[1:21:27] verse entire book of revelation been
[1:21:28] working on it for a year and a half
[1:21:30] and we're just getting started collating
[1:21:32] it now
[1:21:34] and brother mark has been so
[1:21:35] instrumental in that
[1:21:37] and he came on my mind when i woke up
[1:21:40] monday morning i thought that's brother
[1:21:42] mark in my mind i wonder what he's up to
[1:21:44] i should probably call him haven't
[1:21:45] talked to him in a while
[1:21:47] and so i'm just feeling tired i told
[1:21:49] sister debbie i said honey you know can
[1:21:51] i just like lay in the bed this morning
[1:21:53] and i said i overslept you know i
[1:21:55] probably didn't wake up till seven and
[1:21:57] i'm still laying there and
[1:21:59] and she's like well i gotta make this i
[1:22:01] gotta make this bet so you can have to
[1:22:02] hurry
[1:22:04] never mind
[1:22:05] [Laughter]
[1:22:08] but
[1:22:09] amen paul made her the house manager so
[1:22:11] there's nothing i can do about it
[1:22:14] the wife guides the house guides the
[1:22:16] home that's what paul said so
[1:22:18] so that's her domain

[1:22:22] raising boys asking me my boys they'd
[1:22:23] come to me hey dad can we i'm like
[1:22:25] that's mom's department not my problem

[1:22:36] can't she's my manager i can't overrule
[1:22:38] her like that
[1:22:39] and so uh we'd take it outside and so
[1:22:42] so here i am that's that's a little plug
[1:22:44] for you sisters you should be saying
[1:22:46] amen
[1:22:48] don't give him sore ribs though just say
[1:22:50] amen and he'll get the message
[1:22:53] um

[1:22:56] kitchen that's yet scripture
[1:22:58] that's bible amen
[1:23:00] and so
[1:23:02] so so i i said hey can i just lay here
[1:23:04] for a little bit and i she said well for
[1:23:06] a little bit and so i i'm always up
[1:23:08] early i'm way up early ahead of her and
[1:23:10] so this morning i was tired from that
[1:23:12] long
[1:23:13] for service revival meeting
[1:23:16] and i and i i open up my laptop and boom
[1:23:20] there's an email guess who it's from
[1:23:22] i'll bet you can guess
[1:23:24] it's from mark coffey it's like wow
[1:23:27] that's a little spooky
[1:23:28] but so i opened it up and brother mark
[1:23:31] is commenting to me he's actually
[1:23:33] listening now
[1:23:35] and he was commenting me brother jason
[1:23:37] your series on i think it was uh
[1:23:40] uh what what is the church series and
[1:23:43] he was saying oh particularly you know
[1:23:44] this that number eight and number nine
[1:23:47] and then there was a song at the end of
[1:23:48] number eight brother andrew had sung and
[1:23:50] oh my goodness it sounds so awesome i
[1:23:52] immediately sent it to matt hey you need
[1:23:54] to get this on our podcast right away
[1:23:55] said dad it's already it's already on my
[1:23:57] list you only move it to the top i said
[1:23:58] move it to the top that's a good one
[1:24:01] and so so so i'm i just start reading
[1:24:04] his email and he just he sent me this
[1:24:07] this quote
[1:24:08] and it's from 1959
[1:24:11] bomb and gilead now you already know how
[1:24:13] i went to bed
[1:24:14] you already know the burden on my mind
[1:24:18] the one thing that we have to move up to
[1:24:21] now
[1:24:22] is a supreme faith to what we have had
[1:24:26] something that you cannot have that
[1:24:28] faith until you know perfectly what
[1:24:30] you're doing
[1:24:31] when you understand like you you walk
[1:24:34] you just say well i'm going home i'm
[1:24:36] going out to start the car that's all an
[1:24:39] act of faith tomorrow i'll meet you at a
[1:24:41] certain place that's all an act of faith
[1:24:43] because you've just done it so much
[1:24:47] because it's a regular routine with you
[1:24:52] well
[1:24:53] that's the way the things of god are
[1:24:56] after you have trusted him and watched
[1:24:59] him do so many things till it becomes
[1:25:01] just like a regular routine and that's
[1:25:04] the condition i think the church will be
[1:25:06] in just before the coming of the lord
[1:25:10] so the rapture will just go right on
[1:25:12] that way it'll just be a regular routine
[1:25:14] of following the scripture and the plans
[1:25:17] of god it ain't some super scientific
[1:25:20] thing you got to know to get yourself in
[1:25:21] a rapture you know what it is it's an
[1:25:23] everyday relationship every day you're
[1:25:26] getting a little closer and a little
[1:25:27] closer hallelujah remember that you're
[1:25:30] made in his image he feels like you feel
[1:25:33] he loves like you love where'd you get
[1:25:35] love from where'd you get faith it's all
[1:25:37] him
[1:25:39] what a release i just read that and i
[1:25:41] just laid my head back and i could not
[1:25:43] believe
[1:25:44] the lord had answered me so quickly so
[1:25:47] quickly
[1:25:48] and in a source that i couldn't doubt by
[1:25:50] a prophet
[1:25:52] and i said lord i'm not taking you for
[1:25:54] granted but i've seen you do it so many
[1:25:57] times so many times so many times so
[1:25:59] many times i just know you love me and i
[1:26:01] know you love your people and i know
[1:26:03] you're going to feed them and it's not
[1:26:05] up to me it's not on me it's you lord
[1:26:09] i want to tell you something today god
[1:26:11] loves you church
[1:26:13] he cares about you
[1:26:16] he anoints me he anoints these other
[1:26:18] ministers why because because he doesn't
[1:26:20] like you no because he lights you and
[1:26:22] loves you
[1:26:24] see
[1:26:26] so that's the way the things of god are
[1:26:28] so
[1:26:30] when i read this friends
[1:26:33] i'm not reading that
[1:26:35] this is a
[1:26:38] if i'm going to say it this way this
[1:26:39] isn't a a a lay back do nothing
[1:26:43] and wait for
[1:26:45] you know wait for it to fall on you from
[1:26:47] the heavens i'm here to tell you that
[1:26:49] the mighty angel who's bringing you
[1:26:51] rapturing faith has already descended
[1:26:53] from the heavens you're not waiting on
[1:26:55] him to come down and do something for
[1:26:57] you he's here now and the revival is
[1:26:59] among us already
[1:27:02] he's here to do for you more than you
[1:27:05] even could think or ask him to do
[1:27:10] so this is an act of life i'm out of
[1:27:12] time but i'm going to keep going
[1:27:16] not too far just carry on
[1:27:19] so this is an active life that sees
[1:27:24] that sees
[1:27:25] the demonstration
[1:27:27] of the lord
[1:27:29] working in your life
[1:27:32] and it's not if it's not that it's just
[1:27:33] denominationalism to you
[1:27:36] this thing is to be seen
[1:27:38] that you're the light of the world see
[1:27:42] so it
[1:27:44] this isn't taking him for granted this
[1:27:47] isn't taking him for granted
[1:27:49] this is familiarity
[1:27:52] that's a big difference i'm not taking
[1:27:54] him for granted i know him
[1:27:57] and the power of his resurrection that's
[1:27:59] always been my desire in philippians 3
[1:28:02] that i may know him
[1:28:04] in the power of his resurrection and the
[1:28:06] fellowship of his sufferings being made
[1:28:08] conformable unto his death
[1:28:11] see
[1:28:12] but i'm going to tell you something
[1:28:13] friends you hear me now here brother
[1:28:15] jason you don't get that at distance
[1:28:19] young people
[1:28:20] you don't get that at distance
[1:28:22] you don't get familiarity you don't get
[1:28:24] that kind of familiarity at distance
[1:28:28] this requires an active
[1:28:31] daily
[1:28:33] relational type of atmosphere
[1:28:37] i
[1:28:38] i had a very strange dream actually
[1:28:43] wow i don't know why i decided to tell
[1:28:44] you all this but
[1:28:46] just trying to open up my heart
[1:28:51] seemed like maybe it was
[1:28:54] uh don't remember sweetheart did i tell
[1:28:57] you i told you about it sunday monday
[1:28:59] morning i might i think i did yeah i had
[1:29:00] it sunday night
[1:29:02] i had it yeah it was it was sunday night
[1:29:07] so i'm just backing up a little bit
[1:29:08] before waking up finding the email and
[1:29:10] finding this quote
[1:29:12] and so
[1:29:14] i found myself even in the dream
[1:29:17] and we were somewhere
[1:29:19] it seemed like we were in the mountains
[1:29:21] and i was with my family and i don't
[1:29:23] know if we were on a
[1:29:24] family vacation we sometimes take our
[1:29:26] whole tribe and go on a break
[1:29:28] but
[1:29:30] at any rate i i got to myself
[1:29:33] in the dream that's not all important
[1:29:35] why i was there but
[1:29:37] i i found myself even in the dream
[1:29:40] with this same great
[1:29:43] and
[1:29:46] deepening desire
[1:29:48] for more of god
[1:29:50] does it make sense in my life more of
[1:29:54] his presence because that's really what
[1:29:55] it's all about
[1:29:57] it's not about him coming like santa
[1:29:59] claus and doing things for me it's not
[1:30:00] really about that that's shallow that
[1:30:02] that you might as well just chase riches
[1:30:05] see but it's it's all about
[1:30:08] his presence
[1:30:10] his presence is the greatest gift of all
[1:30:13] as sister emily sang to us his presence
[1:30:16] is my greatest gift of all
[1:30:21] and it seemed that i
[1:30:23] i remember in the dream that i could
[1:30:24] feel this very same urgency of the hour
[1:30:27] and i i found myself as i was
[1:30:31] nearing the end of this and i just had
[1:30:32] this burden on my heart and as i i found
[1:30:35] myself just i took off running through a
[1:30:36] field and
[1:30:38] and as i'm running through this field i
[1:30:39] began to weep before the lord as i was
[1:30:41] running
[1:30:43] and it it felt like a sense of urgency
[1:30:45] that's no doubt born you know born of
[1:30:47] all the uh of the impending trouble
[1:30:51] you know that we see in the world i mean
[1:30:52] you look at the headlines you see that
[1:30:54] the united states is just
[1:30:56] a hair's breath away from open war with
[1:30:59] russia i mean friends things are
[1:31:01] happening at an unprecedented pace
[1:31:03] i spoke to you about that sunday that
[1:31:05] the beast system is is starting to flex
[1:31:07] its muscles
[1:31:08] see
[1:31:09] and russia is finding out the hard way
[1:31:12] and china is going to find out they're
[1:31:13] all going to find out you you can't
[1:31:15] resist the beast go to read the book of
[1:31:17] revelation he's given a power to rule
[1:31:19] the world
[1:31:20] see
[1:31:22] and he's starting to exercise he he
[1:31:23] spoke like a dragon at first but then he
[1:31:25] exercised all the power of the first
[1:31:27] beast before him which was old the old
[1:31:30] world in europe
[1:31:31] under pagan and then papal rome
[1:31:36] and so i it felt like as i was crying
[1:31:39] and i was running and
[1:31:40] this desire it all felt like an
[1:31:43] impending trouble like in like something
[1:31:46] that i and i was calling out to the lord
[1:31:48] because i felt that in my heart lord the
[1:31:50] hour it's so critical how do i get
[1:31:53] everybody on board i i you know i want
[1:31:55] to get all the young people full of the
[1:31:56] holy ghost i got to get everybody
[1:31:58] believing god i got to get all the cold
[1:32:00] people hot again i
[1:32:01] we got to come together and this is and
[1:32:03] i'm and i'm i'm aware that constantly
[1:32:06] aware but it starts with you but it
[1:32:08] starts with you but it starts with you
[1:32:09] and i'm saying well then lord help me
[1:32:11] help me help me and i was running and i
[1:32:12] was crying i was saying lord please help
[1:32:14] me and the lord was just saying i need
[1:32:16] you to empty out i need you to empty out
[1:32:18] i need you to empty out and i was saying
[1:32:19] lord i'll leave you i'll empty all empty
[1:32:21] just fill up those places
[1:32:24] that was the cry of my heart
[1:32:30] knowing in my heart that god was calling
[1:32:32] me to walk higher
[1:32:34] to accept the challenge of
[1:32:37] of greater spiritual disciplines in my
[1:32:39] life and for my ministry and
[1:32:41] i felt as though i
[1:32:44] i just needed to push more things out to
[1:32:47] make more room for him to come in
[1:32:52] and then brother mark in his email
[1:32:55] sent me this quote as well
[1:32:57] this is right after the dream
[1:33:00] and that's what the christian does i
[1:33:02] love that message the intervale
[1:33:05] that's what the christian does when
[1:33:07] you're planted in christ jesus
[1:33:08] everything that you have need of
[1:33:11] in earth's journey is in you when you
[1:33:12] receive the holy spirit and the only
[1:33:15] everybody say only
[1:33:17] and the only thing you have to do is
[1:33:20] drink drink and push out push out
[1:33:23] just drink till you can't drink no more
[1:33:25] if you have need of divine healing go to
[1:33:26] god's word and drink from it until you
[1:33:28] push out he's talking about like a tree
[1:33:30] planted by the water all it has it the
[1:33:32] nature to grow limbs and fruit and
[1:33:34] leaves is already in it they don't have
[1:33:36] to try to do it if if it just drinks in
[1:33:38] it'll push out
[1:33:40] you see
[1:33:41] and so divine healing go to god's word
[1:33:43] and drink from until you push out if you
[1:33:44] need more of god just keep drinking push
[1:33:47] out and christ is the inexhaustible
[1:33:49] fountain of life and if you're planted
[1:33:51] in him the only thing you have to do is
[1:33:53] drink of his goodness and push out
[1:33:55] whatever you have need of in this
[1:33:57] earth's journey it's all drinking
[1:33:59] resting peace and that beautiful three
[1:34:02] daisy chained words it's all drinking
[1:34:04] resting peace
[1:34:06] it's not what you struggle and strive
[1:34:08] and pull at
[1:34:10] you defeat the very purpose that you're
[1:34:12] representing when you do that
[1:34:15] you you see friends what what the
[1:34:17] prophet is trying to get us to
[1:34:19] understand
[1:34:20] is that when you when you use a method
[1:34:24] when your spiritual warfare
[1:34:27] is is to just stay in the struggle
[1:34:30] and wait on god to do something
[1:34:33] you know magic
[1:34:35] that that's a defeating battle strategy
[1:34:39] i'm here to tell you that sounds good
[1:34:42] i'm just gonna pray and ask god to come
[1:34:44] and make me a super christian that's
[1:34:47] that the devil's gonna beat you to death
[1:34:49] trying to do that because that's you
[1:34:51] struggling all you need to do is purge
[1:34:54] out everything in the world drink more
[1:34:56] in and push out the fruits of the spirit
[1:34:58] and you'll find that everything you have
[1:35:00] needed for a rapture is in you now
[1:35:05] all that cg needs is the moisture of the
[1:35:08] holy spirit
[1:35:10] and you don't get that at distance
[1:35:12] that's an active not a passive that's an
[1:35:16] active relationship
[1:35:19] you know it was so amazing i
[1:35:22] brother jack and sister kathy the gift
[1:35:24] they got me was a coffee cup that i
[1:35:26] would cherish forever and i i love it
[1:35:29] and
[1:35:32] the lid
[1:35:34] had this very text i didn't notice it
[1:35:35] just until i was the other day i was
[1:35:37] using my lid
[1:35:39] and uh
[1:35:40] and and i i i actually will separate on
[1:35:43] my little stay at home my
[1:35:44] my coffee mug i'll use out here in the
[1:35:46] fellowship hall because i like using it
[1:35:48] and if anybody sees it don't touch it
[1:35:52] give it back hey man if it goes
[1:35:54] disappearing we're gonna have a gestapo
[1:35:56] raid
[1:35:57] but
[1:35:58] but that but that lid has that scripture
[1:36:00] in timothy but thou o man of god
[1:36:04] follow after godliness and righteousness
[1:36:06] and peace and and longsuffering in these
[1:36:09] things and i didn't even notice it it
[1:36:10] was in my text and i thought my goodness
[1:36:12] there's that lid i was putting it on my
[1:36:14] ember cup because i have a cup keeps my
[1:36:16] coffee hot but it works even better if i
[1:36:17] keep a little lid on top and it just is
[1:36:19] perfect and i and and here look look at
[1:36:23] this look at these scriptures can i
[1:36:25] okay look if i take 17 more minutes can
[1:36:27] i do that
[1:36:29] 18 wait 18 and a half
[1:36:33] can i have 18 and a half
[1:36:35] look at this
[1:36:36] thou therefore my son
[1:36:38] be strong
[1:36:40] in the grace that is in christ jesus
[1:36:42] everybody talks about the grace of god
[1:36:44] be strong in the grace
[1:36:46] the grace doesn't come to me to let to
[1:36:49] let you just
[1:36:50] live a wishy-washy life say oh well the
[1:36:52] grace of god be strong in the grace
[1:36:56] the bible says that what is grace the
[1:36:58] bible identifies that the grace of god
[1:37:01] teaches us to deny ungodliness
[1:37:05] amen
[1:37:06] look at look at look at david here in
[1:37:08] the psalms
[1:37:10] depart
[1:37:11] from evil and do good
[1:37:14] seek peace and pursue it
[1:37:17] think about that look at it again depart
[1:37:20] from evil that's not passive
[1:37:23] and do good and seek peace and pursue it
[1:37:28] the eyes of the lord are upon the
[1:37:32] righteous and his ears
[1:37:34] are open to their cry
[1:37:38] you see friends look ultimately we
[1:37:40] overcome
[1:37:42] because we're prophesied we're
[1:37:45] predestinated to be overcomers
[1:37:47] the book of revelation talks about that
[1:37:50] in revelation 12 and uh and other places
[1:37:53] about how that will be an overcomer and
[1:37:55] we'll be granted to sit with him on his
[1:37:57] throne and he would be our god and and
[1:38:00] we would be his son and and in case you
[1:38:02] when i first read that you know i knew
[1:38:04] in the scripture i knew in the new
[1:38:05] testament that the word son could be one
[1:38:07] of two things it could either be who is
[1:38:08] or it could be technon and these are two
[1:38:10] greek words because technon is just the
[1:38:12] most common issues of a child it's used
[1:38:14] of offspring right
[1:38:16] and in fact is jesus was never referred
[1:38:18] to using that greek word he was never
[1:38:21] technon he was always johuios theo the
[1:38:24] son of god
[1:38:26] and it used it of him exclusively the
[1:38:28] only time he ever got called teknan when
[1:38:31] when someone called him son and used the
[1:38:33] wrong word was and mary did it
[1:38:35] she said son do you not know your father
[1:38:36] and i have saw you with tears and jesus
[1:38:38] immediately corrected that error
[1:38:40] because he was not
[1:38:42] he was not the son of joseph and he said
[1:38:44] you do you need to know i must be about
[1:38:46] my father's business
[1:38:49] see so he corrected her right quick and
[1:38:51] no one ever else tried to call him that
[1:38:52] again and when i read that in the
[1:38:54] scriptures in the book of revelation
[1:38:58] and it said that
[1:38:59] you'll sit with me in my throne and i'll
[1:39:01] be his god he that overcometh i'll be
[1:39:04] his god and he'll be my son and i read
[1:39:06] that and i thought well of course
[1:39:07] that'll be techno and that won't be who
[1:39:09] he is because that was only jesus and i
[1:39:11] went into my greek dog lot and would you
[1:39:13] imagine it was exactly who he is
[1:39:15] that he was using the exact same word
[1:39:17] it's about position and placing that you
[1:39:19] are in christ and that's why he's the
[1:39:22] beginning of the creation of god and you
[1:39:23] are a continuation of that same creation
[1:39:26] this is what god has we are
[1:39:28] predestinated to overcome it i mean
[1:39:30] ultimately we are going to overcome and
[1:39:33] in fact as he gives us a faith he gives
[1:39:36] you the faith by revelation to believe
[1:39:39] you and then he turns around and rewards
[1:39:41] you for the faith you have see
[1:39:44] but remember it's it's it's it has to be
[1:39:47] an active faith it's not it's not like
[1:39:49] santa claus
[1:39:51] see he's not just giving you some
[1:39:53] presents on christmas morning i mean
[1:39:55] there is to to be an overcomer the bible
[1:39:58] says in the book of revelation
[1:40:00] i think chapter 12
[1:40:02] they overcame by the blood of the lamb
[1:40:04] and we do
[1:40:06] see and that's twofold because first of
[1:40:08] all remember brother branham said the
[1:40:10] blood is what keeps you why
[1:40:12] because there's a constant perpetual
[1:40:15] voice in the blood that even when you do
[1:40:17] wrong even when you slip up make a
[1:40:19] mistake but there's a blood constantly
[1:40:21] speaking they're innocent they're
[1:40:23] innocent they're innocent and god
[1:40:25] doesn't even see it because even when
[1:40:27] you stumble that it can't override that
[1:40:30] voice before god they're they're
[1:40:31] innocent they're innocent they're
[1:40:32] innocent because you're him
[1:40:35] and he was innocent see
[1:40:37] and and so there is that aspect of it
[1:40:39] and then there's also the aspect of the
[1:40:42] of the cleansing agent of the blood see
[1:40:45] that we are washed clean by the washing
[1:40:48] of the water of the word and brother
[1:40:51] branham showed us in this day it's a
[1:40:53] bleeding word why because it's christ
[1:40:55] it's a person
[1:40:57] and so it's a bleeding word it's got
[1:41:00] life in it it's not dead letter
[1:41:03] so so it has these this twofold power of
[1:41:06] rapturing faith i mean it does have
[1:41:08] rapturing faith and it does have
[1:41:10] rapturing grace
[1:41:15] that it has rapture and grace because i
[1:41:18] say i need rapturing faith
[1:41:20] but i just feel like too much of a
[1:41:22] failure brother jason i don't know if
[1:41:24] i'll ever get it don't worry the
[1:41:25] headstone comes crying grace grace unto
[1:41:28] it
[1:41:29] you just know this friends there is a
[1:41:31] rapture in grace that keeps your faith
[1:41:34] on the move and it'll never stop moving
[1:41:36] your faith forward
[1:41:38] hallelujah
[1:41:40] and so
[1:41:42] so
[1:41:42] so so when we when we think about that
[1:41:46] you know but then it comes back to the
[1:41:47] whole thing of overcoming
[1:41:50] as i read to you in the scripture
[1:41:52] the man that that that overcomes these
[1:41:55] things the man that purgeth himself the
[1:41:58] bride hath made herself ready as brother
[1:42:01] branham said there's things god won't do
[1:42:03] he's waiting on you to do it you say oh
[1:42:06] i just need i heard brother jack today
[1:42:07] on our on our call and i was one of the
[1:42:09] commentators coming behind him brother
[1:42:10] jack said something i never heard in my
[1:42:12] life and he said he's just talking about
[1:42:14] people who are always wanting god you
[1:42:17] know to do it for him god just deliver
[1:42:19] me just set me free i got i'm trapped up
[1:42:21] i got this habit in my life would you
[1:42:22] just take it from me and brother jack
[1:42:24] said ain't that funny you didn't pray to
[1:42:27] get it
[1:42:31] and now you want to pray to get rid of
[1:42:32] it
[1:42:34] say wow oh how'd i get it you picked it
[1:42:36] up

[1:42:43] neat that's that's a nice little way to
[1:42:45] say it but the problem is now it's got a
[1:42:47] hold in my life it's got it's it's
[1:42:49] addicting to me all right now you can go
[1:42:51] to prayer now you can say lord god i
[1:42:54] want to draw closer to you i'm going to
[1:42:56] empty out things of the world i'm going
[1:42:58] to get more in your word i'm going to
[1:43:00] read the bible i'm going to be at church
[1:43:01] i'm going to listen to tapes i'm going
[1:43:03] to and you know what you're doing you
[1:43:04] start strengthening yourself until
[1:43:06] finally you're able to lay it down
[1:43:11] and walk away because everything you
[1:43:14] have need of for a rapture is in you
[1:43:18] now
[1:43:20] you have the ability to be free tonight
[1:43:23] you have the ability to lay it down and
[1:43:26] go forward

[1:43:40] oh i hope
[1:43:42] we're way
[1:43:44] too

[1:44:03] school and come home and play and you

[1:47:12] ready he says then when you come out of
[1:47:15] it on the other side it's like samson
[1:47:17] when he killed the lion when he got on
[1:47:18] the other side when he killed the lion
[1:47:20] he got the sweetest honey he ever eat
[1:47:23] out of that old carcass of that line and
[1:47:25] sometimes if you'll overcome something
[1:47:28] by the grace of god it'll be one of the
[1:47:31] sweetest things you ever tasted in your
[1:47:35] life
[1:47:37] i just thought i don't need m m's i i
[1:47:40] don't need to want this cake i love them
[1:47:42] but i i i want to be an overcomer
[1:47:45] that's my sweet that'll fix your sweet
[1:47:47] tooth overcome a heart trial and come
[1:47:49] out on the other side and look back and
[1:47:51] see a defeated enemy and see the
[1:47:54] wreckage of the battlefield and know
[1:47:56] that your enemy's in the rearview mirror
[1:47:58] hallelujah and you're moving forward
[1:48:05] we talked about it today kate and i were
[1:48:07] talking about it
[1:48:10] and
[1:48:11] she's walking me helping me get fit
[1:48:14] we were actually socializing her new
[1:48:16] little dog
[1:48:17] and out here on this big concrete
[1:48:19] highway they've got for people walking
[1:48:21] like me who need to do it
[1:48:23] and i start talking to her and we start
[1:48:25] talking about overcoming trials
[1:48:27] i said you know honey look
[1:48:29] brother branham said
[1:48:30] he said you know look
[1:48:32] because he was always nervous brother
[1:48:34] man was terribly nervous
[1:48:35] it affected him horribly but he said you
[1:48:38] know i got to thinking
[1:48:39] what if i didn't have any nerves
[1:48:42] he said you know what if i just was like
[1:48:44] whatever he said i'd just be a dish rag
[1:48:48] he said but the fact that i gotta battle
[1:48:50] through it and press through it and come
[1:48:52] through it in victory he said see he
[1:48:55] said that's what he said so it's what
[1:48:58] makes me what i am today
[1:49:00] and he said so nerves end up being a
[1:49:03] blessing
[1:49:05] a blessing
[1:49:07] trials become a blessing
[1:49:09] because god like we read in the
[1:49:11] scripture you know you're pursuing your
[1:49:14] eternal life you're going after it hard
[1:49:16] after you're trying to become everything
[1:49:19] that god called you and gave you eternal
[1:49:21] life for
[1:49:22] in the first place
[1:49:25] but the jack did a funny thing that it's
[1:49:28] not
[1:49:28] funny like comedy but it's ironic
[1:49:31] ironically funny
[1:49:34] he
[1:49:36] he got his church one night his true
[1:49:37] story he just told it today
[1:49:39] and he said i i had my church that i
[1:49:41] think you had the deacon go around and
[1:49:42] just take you know tear up blank pieces
[1:49:45] of paper and he said i want everybody to
[1:49:47] take a piece of paper
[1:49:48] and i want you just to write on this
[1:49:51] paper you don't just sign it i'm not
[1:49:52] going to call you i'm not going to
[1:49:53] embarrass you i'm not going to label you
[1:49:54] and identify you i'm not going to out
[1:49:56] you
[1:49:57] i just want you to write you know the
[1:49:58] top
[1:49:59] couple two three things
[1:50:01] the of the greatest events of your life
[1:50:04] the greatest things that's ever happened
[1:50:06] to you now you know what they did they
[1:50:08] they did what you do
[1:50:10] they they talked about oh the the the
[1:50:13] the day i i found my wife you know or or
[1:50:15] the day i found my husband or or the day
[1:50:18] that i found the lord and i got saved
[1:50:20] and the lord filled me with the holy
[1:50:21] ghost or i i had an incurable disease
[1:50:24] and the lord healed me and was just a
[1:50:26] miracle and today i'm free and you know
[1:50:28] and and he said he he got the whole
[1:50:30] stack up there and it was all just like
[1:50:31] that they're all pretty much pretty much
[1:50:33] carbon copies the day the lord saved me
[1:50:35] the day i found my
[1:50:37] my love of my life the day he healed me
[1:50:39] of this so that this deliverance came
[1:50:41] the day that i my children were born
[1:50:42] everybody you know talking about all
[1:50:44] these different things
[1:50:45] and these are the greatest things that's
[1:50:47] ever happened to me
[1:50:49] and he said now
[1:50:51] he said let me read you what a prophet
[1:50:53] said the greatest thing of your life was
[1:50:57] how you ready for the title
[1:50:59] how can i overcome
[1:51:02] 1963
[1:51:04] in the days of daniel's time
[1:51:07] there was four overcomers that could
[1:51:08] stand the test of fire and lion
[1:51:12] now
[1:51:13] we're expected to be tested
[1:51:16] that's a good lesson for my brother back
[1:51:18] there also
[1:51:19] he that cometh to god must first be
[1:51:22] tested tested what with the word that's
[1:51:26] god's test do you believe it
[1:51:27] congregation says
[1:51:31] he that cometh to god must be tested see
[1:51:35] that only shows
[1:51:37] a true child then see
[1:51:39] be tested
[1:51:41] and when the test comes on
[1:51:43] you can't overcome
[1:51:45] lest there's a test give to you
[1:51:50] and when test is given
[1:51:52] it's to see whether you can overcome or
[1:51:54] not and jesus said
[1:51:57] to him that overcometh
[1:51:59] the test
[1:52:01] see the test
[1:52:03] is the greatest thing that ever happened
[1:52:07] to you
[1:52:12] it's not when you've met the love of
[1:52:13] your life it's not when you got healed
[1:52:15] of something it's not none of that
[1:52:18] your children were a great
[1:52:19] accomplishment grandchildren are better
[1:52:21] but
[1:52:22] the the greatest thing that ever
[1:52:25] happened to you
[1:52:27] is you got a test
[1:52:29] and you passed it
[1:52:33] that is the greatest thing
[1:52:35] that god could ever do for you
