[46:59] amen praise the lord we're going to uh
[47:02] invite you to chapter 24 of matthew's
[47:04] gospel this morning we're going to take
[47:06] a
[47:07] special prayer request that i received i
[47:10] heard a
[47:11] couple of other prayer requests that you
[47:12] were praying about but
[47:14] i got a request from sister becky coffey
[47:17] mr debbie got it actually this morning
[47:20] can you please have your church pray
[47:22] especially for brother tim arrowood from
[47:25] johnson city i assume he goes to brother
[47:27] donnie's church
[47:28] our dear friends and
[47:30] he lived with us for a while after he
[47:33] was baptized in our church in ohio so
[47:35] this is way back in the day when brother
[47:37] berry is pastoring in ohio he is an icu
[47:40] on high oxygen flow with double covered
[47:43] pneumonia listed in critical condition
[47:46] and not doing good at all well prayer
[47:48] changes things doesn't it prayer changes
[47:50] everything so i'm glad
[47:53] for that i think that we should believe
[47:55] god for all i believe we should believe
[47:57] him to keep his promises
[47:59] he is more than able and and already
[48:03] willing there's no question in the bible
[48:05] when you read
[48:06] the life of jesus in the gospels
[48:09] there's no time he was not willing to
[48:11] heal somebody that wanted him to heal
[48:13] them he's always willing don't ever let
[48:15] the devil say
[48:17] it might not be his will to heal you
[48:19] brother branham makes one quote he said
[48:21] i mean he had people lined up and they
[48:23] went all the way down the wall and out
[48:24] the door and brother branham said i'm
[48:25] just as convinced that he's willing to
[48:28] heal every single person in this prayer
[48:30] line
[48:30] as i've ever been of anything so
[48:33] we find that whenever he was asked lord
[48:35] if thou will thou can make me whole and
[48:37] he said i will
[48:39] be thou whole
[48:40] so we want to
[48:42] ask the lord
[48:44] on behalf of this
[48:46] poor brother and of course
[48:48] they've had uh
[48:50] uh some problems i the last report i got
[48:53] is that it was starting to improve uh i
[48:55] guess somebody came in and they had it
[48:57] and it kind of spread through really
[48:59] quick and uh they had to cancel a couple
[49:01] of services i think they've got it under
[49:03] control and it's already uh beginning to
[49:05] improve was the last word i got i want
[49:08] to keep praying for sister meredith's
[49:10] parents up there and um
[49:12] but uh all is well they're doing good
[49:15] and so we're just thanking the lord for
[49:16] that
[49:17] amen matthew 24 i just want to read the
[49:22] first two verses and we will let you be
[49:24] seated we're going to read a lot of
[49:26] scriptures today so
[49:28] i'm just going to read this and let you
[49:30] be seated straight away matthew 24 verse
[49:33] 1 and 2.
[49:35] jesus went out and departed from the
[49:38] temple
[49:39] and his disciples came to him for to
[49:41] show him the building buildings of the
[49:44] temple
[49:46] and jesus said unto them

[50:24] evening or maybe early monday morning i
[50:26] can't even remember but you just
[50:28] exploded it to me and lord i've thought
[50:31] on it throughout the entire week
[50:33] and it seems the enemies fought it but
[50:35] that's okay he ain't nobody and we're
[50:38] here as your servants this morning
[50:40] grateful that i believe i have your
[50:42] perfect mind for the lesson this morning
[50:45] now lord we commit it to you and i ask
[50:48] for this special prayer request you've
[50:50] already heard other prayer requests that
[50:52] were offered we pray for your mercy in
[50:54] these cases we pray for assemblies who
[50:57] are suffering under this
[50:59] lord this virus and we pray for uh our
[51:03] different ones that we're continuing to
[51:05] pray for sister karen pruitt we're
[51:07] continuing to pray for our own brother
[51:10] joe we want to see complete regeneration
[51:12] of lung tissue we want to see complete
[51:15] regeneration of brain cells for our
[51:17] sister karen we want to see a complete
[51:19] total deliverance lord for your people
[51:22] i'm praying for brother tim arrow wood
[51:24] lord i don't think i know him but you
[51:27] know him lord and so we've been asked to
[51:29] pray and as a church we offer this
[51:31] prayer up to you calling his name asking
[51:34] you to be kind to him now lord and help
[51:36] him lord it's a very dire situation and
[51:39] we're looking to the mercies of christ
[51:42] granted lord may you may you continue to
[51:44] improve the situation there in happy
[51:46] valley we thank you for it
[51:48] lord and we're asking now that you be
[51:50] with us in the word today in jesus name
[51:53] amen god bless you can be seated
[52:12] amen
[52:19] we spoke to you about
[52:21] the waters of separation some time ago
[52:26] and i i want to take a
[52:29] um
[52:30] a rather odd little trek
[52:32] uh this morning if i could call it odd i
[52:35] guess you know the lord being mysterious
[52:37] being god being god
[52:39] he does things that
[52:40] are
[52:42] his ways are above our ways
[52:44] and past finding out
[52:46] so i just want you to give me your
[52:48] undivided attention for a little while
[52:51] um because this thought has been
[52:53] difficult coming
[52:54] it seemed to explode to me right off the
[52:57] bat in the early part of the week
[52:59] and then it just seemed like that uh the
[53:01] lord wanted me to ruminate
[53:03] on what he gave me on that first initial
[53:06] uh unveiling and quite an unveiling it
[53:09] was it didn't
[53:11] it wasn't a short thing it went on for a
[53:13] little while
[53:16] and i was you know typing as fast as i
[53:19] could to keep up with the holy spirit
[53:21] and then it just seemed like the lord
[53:23] wanted me to take the whole week and
[53:24] ponder its ramifications and
[53:27] it was only really two o'clock this
[53:30] morning i was awakened out of complete
[53:32] sleep went to sleep around 9 9 30 walked
[53:35] straight up at 2 am and the lord
[53:36] speaking to my heart and i immediately
[53:39] went into the living room and
[53:40] got the got what i've been waiting all
[53:42] week for
[53:44] so we're thanking the lord for it and
[53:46] it's meant quite a bit to me to study it
[53:49] these are
[53:50] exceptional times friends and we're in a
[53:53] day and now i suppose that if a preacher
[53:57] at least me you know i i think that
[53:59] that's one of the
[54:01] paramount if i could use that word that
[54:03] for you to be able to recognize your day
[54:06] and its message for you now that's
[54:08] that's not a cliche i'm meaning for you
[54:11] to see
[54:12] where we are in the word right now
[54:15] on august 1 2021
[54:18] all right
[54:18] and your place
[54:21] in that because i can tell you you have
[54:24] a place in it
[54:25] and god it has a very specific way he
[54:28] wants you to be operating and if you're
[54:32] not operating in that way in that
[54:35] channel in that line then you're you're
[54:38] gonna you're gonna suffer for it not i
[54:40] don't mean god's reaching out and
[54:41] slapping you around i mean you're gonna
[54:43] miss out on blessings you're gonna miss
[54:45] out on power you're gonna miss out on
[54:48] accomplishment and it and the sad part
[54:51] for any preacher i suppose especially a
[54:53] preacher with as a shepherd with a
[54:55] shepherd's heart is when i see people
[54:58] miss out and i say to myself it need not
[55:01] have been
[55:02] that is that is that is impossibly
[55:05] difficult for me to describe to you
[55:08] what uh angst that gives me to
[55:11] see you suffer and not or to see you
[55:14] miss an opportunity or to see the devil
[55:16] be able to have some victory when it
[55:18] need not beat or see you suffer uh
[55:22] maybe it's not has anything to do
[55:24] might not have anything to do with the
[55:26] trial it might just simply be god needs
[55:28] to teach you a lesson you should have
[55:30] took two steps forward and took a right
[55:32] and then left and then went straight
[55:33] instead you went two steps backwards
[55:35] went left left left left up right and
[55:37] you're just all over the map and god is
[55:39] saying okay stop hold it time wait
[55:42] okay i'm gonna have to rough you up a
[55:44] little bit and get you to learn to do
[55:47] things my way
[55:49] and it you know it's not it's it's love
[55:52] it's love that does that it's not the
[55:54] curse of god it's love
[55:56] and so you know
[55:58] i've often made the comment i've learned
[56:00] it by experience that
[56:02] sometimes though the exact perfect will
[56:05] of god can be difficult
[56:08] to discern but boy you'll know it if you
[56:10] miss it i mean like that as soon as you
[56:13] miss it you realize oh wow i missed that
[56:16] one and i've had that experience
[56:18] more times than i'm comfortable
[56:20] admitting and so you know you want to
[56:23] know
[56:24] what's up
[56:26] what lord what's up
[56:29] where do i need to be
[56:30] what do i need to be doing what do i
[56:32] need to know
[56:33] uh the the the first thing when the seal
[56:36] each seal was open those first four
[56:38] seals
[56:39] as soon as john says when one of the
[56:42] creatures opened the seal the first
[56:44] words of instruction were come and see
[56:48] so we need to see the lord in his
[56:51] movements
[56:52] because remember that when the seventh
[56:55] seal unveiled the mighty god when it
[56:57] unsealed god the mystery of god it also
[57:00] unsealed a bride
[57:02] who was part of that mystery
[57:04] amen so jesus
[57:06] doesn't feel the need nor does he plan
[57:09] to move through this earth and a nail
[57:11] scarred body he shouldn't have to he
[57:14] already accomplished his work in that
[57:16] body he likes to move in your body
[57:19] amen
[57:20] now that's wonderful because since he
[57:23] already lived calvary in his body you
[57:25] don't have to worry about doing that
[57:27] that's already accomplished for you but
[57:29] now he wants you to live out his word
[57:32] think about it friends he's the he's a
[57:35] high priest
[57:36] of our of our confession right doesn't
[57:38] the bible describe him that because that
[57:42] he went through because he was tempted
[57:45] like you and i
[57:47] then he can be a faithful high priest
[57:49] who can be touched
[57:51] by the feeling of our infirmities
[57:53] because he went through things
[57:55] all right well guess what
[57:58] he didn't he didn't live here in 2021
[58:01] he didn't live in satan's eden
[58:04] he didn't he lived 2000 years ago
[58:07] so how would he know
[58:09] what it's like living here unless he
[58:12] knows it living through you
[58:14] amen so you're actually helping him be a
[58:18] faithful high priest
[58:20] you're part of that godhead the bride is
[58:23] part of god's godhead that's a direct
[58:26] quote
[58:27] amen so when you realize that
[58:30] then take on to yourself the
[58:33] responsibility of being the word made
[58:37] flesh when jesus was the word made flesh
[58:40] he comes to this point and he goes back
[58:42] to pick up a prophecy sacrifices and
[58:45] offerings those had no pleasure that was
[58:46] never your plan
[58:48] that was just you
[58:49] in kindness giving man a substitute till
[58:51] you could get to the real thing you
[58:53] passed over judgment knowing that you
[58:55] would finally bring it on to christ and
[58:57] he would suffer all the judgment and so
[58:59] the bible teaches that that he wouldn't
[59:01] he just kept passing over judgment and
[59:03] generation kept living and his family
[59:05] kept going and he just passed over
[59:07] judgment they were all born in sin
[59:09] and there was no way they could do
[59:11] enough good to stand in his presence but
[59:14] rather than than judgment
[59:16] to destroy them for their sin the bible
[59:19] teaches us that he passed over it it
[59:21] just kept passing over it passing over
[59:23] it he delayed his judgment delayed his
[59:25] judgment because he knew what job caught
[59:29] i know someday
[59:31] my redeemer will stand on the earth and
[59:33] god knew that
[59:35] and so god knew that someday i can i can
[59:37] put my family in paradise i can't bring
[59:39] them to heaven i'll put them down in the
[59:41] in in into the lower parts of the earth
[59:43] in a paradise and i won't judge them for
[59:46] being born in sin because someday i'm
[59:48] going to come as the lamb and i'm going
[59:50] to atone for it all and then i can go
[59:52] get them and i can bring them home
[59:56] hallelujah i'm here to tell you in that
[59:59] second exodus
[1:00:01] egypt coming out of uh israel coming out
[1:00:03] of egypt being the first that second
[1:00:05] exodus on that day of the resurrection
[1:00:07] today there's a third exodus and he has
[1:00:10] done the exact same thing he has sent a
[1:00:13] prophet with a pillar of fire and a
[1:00:15] bleeding word and that word is life and
[1:00:18] liberty to you so that he can he can
[1:00:20] take you with all your bumps and knots
[1:00:22] and wrinkles and warts and ups and downs
[1:00:25] and ins and outs and weaknesses and
[1:00:27] transgressions and sins and stupidity
[1:00:31] and just say i've perfected you in
[1:00:33] christ it doesn't matter come on home
[1:00:35] hallelujah because why you have believed
[1:00:38] the word
[1:00:40] you have accepted the atoning bleeding
[1:00:44] word
[1:00:48] there are multiple categories today of
[1:00:50] humanity at the end time of which
[1:00:53] concerning them all the lord is fully
[1:00:55] aware
[1:00:57] all of which god is dealing with and
[1:00:59] speaking to
[1:01:02] speaking to even if even if only
[1:01:04] warning and instructing them how to
[1:01:07] escape the judgments that are coming you
[1:01:09] remember i put that up twice two
[1:01:12] services in a row to show you that god
[1:01:14] was speaking to the false church to warn
[1:01:16] it how to escape judgments remember
[1:01:19] god's still
[1:01:21] in the mercy business
[1:01:22] and he's still trying to save everybody
[1:01:24] that will accept it this thing ain't
[1:01:26] over friends
[1:01:28] so let's continue to preach the gospel
[1:01:30] of grace and mercy let's continue to
[1:01:33] reach out to the world with the truth of
[1:01:36] this hour
[1:01:37] and so we realize that he is dealing and
[1:01:40] speaking to them
[1:01:42] even if it's just to warn them instruct
[1:01:44] them on how to escape judgments that are
[1:01:46] coming but only in the bride but only
[1:01:49] the bride is he speaking through
[1:01:53] there's a big difference in speaking too
[1:01:55] and speaking through
[1:01:57] amen
[1:01:58] so we see in our various categories and
[1:02:00] i'm not going to get into the law all
[1:02:02] today we see the jews
[1:02:04] you know down through the ages were
[1:02:06] given white robes and are
[1:02:08] under the altar of god they all are
[1:02:09] they're in different places the brother
[1:02:11] branham when he went beyond the curtain
[1:02:13] of time he said i want to see jesus said
[1:02:15] no he's up higher
[1:02:16] so he's in an under an altar brother
[1:02:19] branham when he went there didn't see
[1:02:21] luther
[1:02:22] or wesley
[1:02:23] he saw his own converts see
[1:02:26] and he says i saw you there
[1:02:28] i love that one and so
[1:02:31] and so we we realized that they're all
[1:02:34] segmented and and in their place under
[1:02:36] the altar
[1:02:37] and you know even
[1:02:39] i mean that's that's why the under the
[1:02:41] fifth seal
[1:02:42] when
[1:02:43] when the the seventh you know when when
[1:02:46] the trumpets and seals are all running
[1:02:48] together and you find that under the
[1:02:50] fifth seal you have those jews who have
[1:02:52] suffered down through the ages since
[1:02:55] since the days of jesus warning right
[1:02:57] here in matthew 24 he starts warning
[1:02:59] then we're going to cover in a minute
[1:03:01] and then all the way down through the
[1:03:03] ages it wasn't just hitler nikon that
[1:03:05] persecuted them they've been scattered
[1:03:07] and persecuted for 2000 years
[1:03:09] you see and so
[1:03:11] here suddenly
[1:03:13] god sends a seventh messenger to the
[1:03:15] gentiles with a message of the open book
[1:03:19] and then and then a bride is ready for a
[1:03:21] body change but god can't change her
[1:03:24] bodies until he sends those six
[1:03:26] dimension saints back because the dead
[1:03:28] in christ shall rise first
[1:03:31] and when they start leaving and heading
[1:03:33] down to pick up their body and here's
[1:03:35] these jews saying
[1:03:37] what about us
[1:03:39] and and they're told no no you this
[1:03:41] gentiles you've got to stay a little
[1:03:42] while longer because your brethren have
[1:03:44] to suffer the tribulation there's 144
[1:03:47] 000 of them who haven't bowed to
[1:03:48] political nonsense and haven't taken the
[1:03:51] mark of the beast like god told elijah i
[1:03:53] have 7 000 still who have not bowed the
[1:03:56] knee to baal and so they're told you
[1:03:58] must wait a little while uh until your
[1:04:00] brethren uh have been uh finished till
[1:04:04] that cycle to get them has been finished
[1:04:06] and so we see that they're given white
[1:04:08] robes for the gospel for the for the
[1:04:10] truth that they held uh not not christ
[1:04:13] they didn't have a testimony of christ
[1:04:15] it said for the testimony that they held
[1:04:17] that they they held the testimony of
[1:04:20] jehovah that they had gotten from moses
[1:04:21] and they were true
[1:04:23] they weren't just
[1:04:25] political jews they were actual hebrews
[1:04:27] sons of abraham
[1:04:29] all right and then of course you have
[1:04:31] the unwise virgin who are are granted to
[1:04:34] wash their robes in the blood of the
[1:04:35] lamb by enduring the tribulation period
[1:04:38] and you find when you look back in
[1:04:40] genesis that god helps them during that
[1:04:43] time we see just as he saw god helping
[1:04:46] lot you know to save him from from
[1:04:48] destruction in this case he the the
[1:04:51] hunter the foolish virgin are going to
[1:04:53] have to give their lives but they're
[1:04:55] safe from eternal destruction they're
[1:04:57] they're saved from eternal destruction
[1:04:59] you see and you can see the types of
[1:05:01] that you see god helping lot and and and
[1:05:04] because when you go into genesis and you
[1:05:05] look at the conversation between lot and
[1:05:08] and that one being it's not the two
[1:05:10] angels anymore they're they're actually
[1:05:11] gone
[1:05:12] and now there's a single being who's
[1:05:14] identifying himself as the one that met
[1:05:16] abraham he's the same god
[1:05:18] and and lot is saying sir please let me
[1:05:20] go into the city and he says all right
[1:05:22] go because i can't destroy until you're
[1:05:24] safe so we find these types and shadows
[1:05:27] and these allegories where god god does
[1:05:30] even in the tribulation when the when
[1:05:32] the beast you know gushes of a torrent
[1:05:35] of water and the bible says the earth
[1:05:36] opens up and swallows the water so we
[1:05:39] don't know how it's all going to pan out
[1:05:40] i'm not here to teach on that today but
[1:05:42] we do know that god has a place they
[1:05:45] gain entrance into eternal life in
[1:05:48] heaven at the end of the bride's 1000
[1:05:50] year honeymoon amen
[1:05:52] the gentile elected bride
[1:05:54] have no need like like these unwise
[1:05:57] virgins who have washed their robes in
[1:05:59] the blood of the lamb the gentile
[1:06:02] elected bride have no need to do that to
[1:06:05] wash her robes in the blood of the lamb
[1:06:07] because she is the blood of god by the
[1:06:09] spirit yes amen which is a direct quote
[1:06:12] she is the blood of god by the spirit by
[1:06:16] the indwelling revealed faith in the
[1:06:19] living bleeding washing word amen amen
[1:06:25] amen and that's why when people leave
[1:06:27] the living bleeding washing word they
[1:06:30] backslide amen and so far it's never not
[1:06:33] happened
[1:06:34] because why they left the life source
[1:06:37] and they stopped coming in two and three
[1:06:39] times a week to get washed up
[1:06:42] you see and so they just get worse and
[1:06:44] worse and worse so there is a there is a
[1:06:47] value in the living word it's a bleeding
[1:06:50] word it's a washing word it's a
[1:06:51] faith-giving word it's the only word god
[1:06:54] can bring revelation through
[1:06:56] all right so we find that that that this
[1:07:00] bride is part of the word in redemption
[1:07:03] so in effect she is the blood of god by
[1:07:05] the spirit she carries his life and the
[1:07:08] new testament baptism of the holy ghost
[1:07:11] in a new birth isn't that beautiful and
[1:07:14] so she's already judged in christ all
[1:07:16] unbelief has been annihilated from her
[1:07:19] soul and her mind is regularly washed
[1:07:21] clean by the washing of the water of the
[1:07:24] word for her day which is a water of
[1:07:26] separation amen right now i read this to
[1:07:29] you uh some time ago i decided not to
[1:07:32] put it up today because i don't want to
[1:07:33] read it in its entirety and skip over it
[1:07:35] but brother branham takes this thought
[1:07:37] in thinking man's filter in exodus 19 he
[1:07:39] refers to
[1:07:41] about the waters of separation he talks
[1:07:43] about how the the they have the red
[1:07:46] heifer and it had to be red and the
[1:07:47] color of red is an atonement and he says
[1:07:50] science knows that if you take red and
[1:07:52] look through red to red it's white so
[1:07:56] so listen friends i i know that you're
[1:07:59] sinners saved by grace
[1:08:02] and i know you still have your ups and
[1:08:04] downs and so do i and i know that
[1:08:07] sometimes we're like elijah men of like
[1:08:10] passions
[1:08:11] come on all you holy people
[1:08:14] but thanks be to god he looks at your
[1:08:16] red mistakes through his red blood and
[1:08:19] he sees white
[1:08:22] just rejoice in that just rest in that
[1:08:25] don't let your mistakes and weaknesses
[1:08:27] hold you back from accomplishing what
[1:08:29] god wants you to accomplish because it
[1:08:31] can and it will if you let it don't let
[1:08:34] it
[1:08:36] just say lord i am your son and here's
[1:08:38] what i know i don't know why i did that
[1:08:39] but i do know i'm your son
[1:08:41] i i don't know why i make so many
[1:08:43] mistakes but i know i believe your word
[1:08:46] hallelujah and i know it's the desire of
[1:08:48] my heart
[1:08:50] to live perfectly
[1:08:53] and god knows that and i've often been
[1:08:55] so glad he knows my heart like peter
[1:08:57] said lord you know i love you
[1:08:59] aren't you glad for that
[1:09:02] if i offended you i'd have to explain it
[1:09:04] to you and get you to love me again and
[1:09:06] then if i did it twice i'd have to
[1:09:08] really explain it to you and then if i
[1:09:10] did it seven times and then if i did it
[1:09:12] 70 times seven by that time you don't
[1:09:14] want to hear me
[1:09:16] i've seen situations so bad where
[1:09:19] somebody says i didn't want to hear you
[1:09:21] say sorry i don't even want to hear you
[1:09:22] say those words
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:29] but you know i i love the fact
[1:09:32] that when i can come to him
[1:09:36] and i can say to him i i you know and
[1:09:39] i'm trying if i've stumbled i i don't
[1:09:42] have to sit down and think up some
[1:09:45] flowery speech
[1:09:46] some crafted
[1:09:48] you know penmanship and
[1:09:50] word art to to convince him lord i
[1:09:54] actually do love you i really am sorry
[1:09:58] oh after a while he wouldn't want to see
[1:10:00] your little drawings of hearts and he
[1:10:02] wouldn't want to hear apologies and he
[1:10:03] wouldn't want to hear anything and you
[1:10:05] know that's what the jews kept trying to
[1:10:07] do and you know what happened he said i
[1:10:09] don't want your sacrifices anymore they
[1:10:11] stink
[1:10:12] it makes me nauseated stop bringing them
[1:10:15] because all you do is go back and do it
[1:10:16] again you see why paul kept trying to
[1:10:18] tell the jews that's a that's not a
[1:10:20] perfect system it can never bring the
[1:10:22] worshiper there unto perfect if it could
[1:10:25] why do you keep going back every year to
[1:10:26] redo it
[1:10:27] but god promised that the atonement that
[1:10:30] was coming would be once for all amen
[1:10:33] that would settle it before god and you
[1:10:35] would forever stand in the presence of
[1:10:37] god perfect in christ
[1:10:40] so so this is how to stand clean
[1:10:43] and acceptable before god to receive his
[1:10:46] bleeding word that washes you clean
[1:10:48] brother branham said he looks through
[1:10:50] red blood of the lord jesus
[1:10:52] and and our red sins become white as
[1:10:55] snow red through red and the heifer was
[1:10:57] killed in the evening time that's so
[1:10:58] relevant to us let me skip down all
[1:11:01] right and so he said a clean man clean
[1:11:03] hands had to keep it in a clean place so
[1:11:06] clean clean clean all right not a place
[1:11:08] where jezebels and ricky's and
[1:11:10] everything partaking the communion and
[1:11:13] things and they're running around with
[1:11:14] wives and husbands and all kinds of
[1:11:15] filth going on and dances and parties
[1:11:17] and wearing bob hair and shorts and
[1:11:19] everything else and call themselves
[1:11:20] christians so these people go to church
[1:11:22] yeah
[1:11:24] who who goes to church these ones that
[1:11:26] run around with other wives and other
[1:11:28] husbands and all kinds of filth they go
[1:11:30] to church oh yeah they go to dances and
[1:11:32] parties i thought you said they go to
[1:11:34] church they do they also go to dances
[1:11:36] and parties and they wear bobbed hair
[1:11:38] and they wear shorts and everything and
[1:11:39] call themselves christians
[1:11:41] see but brother branham said that the
[1:11:43] atonement can't be there because in
[1:11:45] exodus 19 it had to be
[1:11:49] held and cleaned by clean hands and put
[1:11:51] in a clean place
[1:11:53] see
[1:11:54] so i don't care how bad the the nominal
[1:11:57] christian world don't like to hear me
[1:12:00] preaching against sinful lifestyle
[1:12:03] i'm sorry but if you're not living a
[1:12:05] righteous lifestyle you have no access
[1:12:08] to the atoning
[1:12:10] power of christ
[1:12:12] i know you make mistakes but it can't be
[1:12:14] in your heart to do that
[1:12:16] in your heart you've got to he that's
[1:12:18] born of god does not commit sin the
[1:12:21] desire's gone
[1:12:22] see
[1:12:23] so he has no more conscience of sin his
[1:12:25] that means his desire for sin is gone
[1:12:29] and if and if you're still struggling
[1:12:30] against and i'm not talking about your
[1:12:32] fallen flesh that gets tempted i'm
[1:12:34] talking about if in your heart this is
[1:12:36] just a social gathering for you and you
[1:12:39] gather here because you like to have
[1:12:40] some place to go and you like the people
[1:12:42] and you love the people and we probably
[1:12:43] love you too and you think we're great
[1:12:45] and we probably think you're great but
[1:12:47] if that's your only purpose in being
[1:12:48] here and you never let the word take
[1:12:50] over your life you're going to go into a
[1:12:51] tribulation
[1:12:53] having me as your pastor won't save you
[1:12:55] believing brother branham was a prophet
[1:12:56] won't save you
[1:12:58] that won't save you at all you'll go
[1:12:59] right into a tribulation period see
[1:13:02] and so so he says
[1:13:05] so before they could fellowship in
[1:13:07] worship
[1:13:09] the the the people had to pass through
[1:13:12] these waters of separation see it talks
[1:13:14] about the seven stripes of blood because
[1:13:16] that's uh to all seven ages and now we
[1:13:20] want to look at ephesians 5 26 and it's
[1:13:22] the washing of the water by the word of
[1:13:24] waters of separation what does it do
[1:13:27] then the filter of god is the word
[1:13:29] waters of separation washing of the
[1:13:31] waters of separation by the word god's
[1:13:34] filter then
[1:13:35] you can't come into christ
[1:13:37] through a church filter
[1:13:40] you cannot come by a denominational
[1:13:42] filter or a creed filter there is only
[1:13:46] one filter that you can enter into that
[1:13:50] holy place that's through the washing of
[1:13:53] the water by the word the word of god is
[1:13:57] a thinking man's filter
[1:14:01] so
[1:14:02] when we talk about coming to the waters
[1:14:04] of separation
[1:14:07] then then that compels progress
[1:14:11] or it compels
[1:14:12] forward movement
[1:14:14] because you've got to constantly come to
[1:14:17] god you've got to constantly move in his
[1:14:20] channels
[1:14:21] you you know that paul will use language
[1:14:24] like press
[1:14:25] toward
[1:14:26] you know i i mean i can't press on that
[1:14:29] door from here
[1:14:31] i've tried to operate the force i can't
[1:14:32] get it to work some
[1:14:35] sometimes my grandkids will see me drop
[1:14:37] something they'll go to pick it up and
[1:14:38] say wait a minute try the force
[1:14:42] still can't make it work
[1:14:44] someday i will
[1:14:46] amen i i read i read actually a
[1:14:48] testimony of the guy who wrote all of
[1:14:50] that whole futuristic series and he
[1:14:53] actually admitted he took it right out
[1:14:54] of the bible yeah
[1:14:56] confessed it he said oh yeah good and
[1:14:58] evil light and darkness luke vader all
[1:15:01] those guys that's that's god the devil
[1:15:03] his prophets his apostles versus evil
[1:15:05] men good versus darkness the the the
[1:15:08] light sword he said that's the bible
[1:15:11] that was his testimony the man who
[1:15:13] invented it
[1:15:14] and he didn't he wasn't even shy to to
[1:15:15] say it i read it i read his interview
[1:15:18] and so so we we realized that
[1:15:21] that that when we when we think about
[1:15:24] pressing toward the mark
[1:15:26] i mean
[1:15:28] i want to go in a rapture
[1:15:31] so that means i have to go forward
[1:15:34] i don't want to miss the rapture
[1:15:36] so that means i shouldn't stay back and
[1:15:38] idle
[1:15:40] i've got to constantly be moving forward
[1:15:44] it compels progress
[1:15:46] it compels forward movement and a
[1:15:49] willingness to go high in the spirit and
[1:15:53] a willingness to go higher
[1:15:56] and when you get
[1:15:58] higher you have to have a willingness to
[1:16:00] go
[1:16:01] higher amen
[1:16:03] and when you get higher and higher you
[1:16:05] have to contain a willingness that wants
[1:16:07] to go higher higher and higher than
[1:16:10] higher yeah
[1:16:11] all right
[1:16:12] and so we realized then that there has
[1:16:15] to be always this forging ahead and the
[1:16:18] only way you go higher is it's to go
[1:16:21] forge into a forge a deeper relationship
[1:16:24] with christ in his word because
[1:16:27] physically high is not what we're
[1:16:29] talking about you you could you could
[1:16:31] get in elon musk rocket ship and escape
[1:16:35] earth's gravitational pull that wouldn't
[1:16:37] put you in heaven amen it wouldn't put
[1:16:39] you in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:16:41] so we're we're talking about a spiritual
[1:16:44] thing so to go higher spiritually you
[1:16:47] have to go deeper into the spirit
[1:16:50] all right my burden first
[1:16:52] so this forward motion this
[1:16:56] constant
[1:16:58] moving
[1:16:59] deeper into christ which then elevates
[1:17:02] you higher
[1:17:04] it elevates you higher in wisdom who
[1:17:06] don't want it
[1:17:07] anybody don't want that
[1:17:09] anybody don't want wisdom
[1:17:11] it elevates you in power who don't want
[1:17:13] that right amen
[1:17:15] it elevates you in the treasures of
[1:17:17] heaven who don't want that raise your
[1:17:19] hand please
[1:17:20] we're gonna pray for you
[1:17:23] so going deeper and and i use the word
[1:17:26] forging because you have to forget you
[1:17:28] have to press paul said
[1:17:30] it means to strain it means to you know
[1:17:33] if there's something beyond your natural
[1:17:36] limit and you have to
[1:17:38] stretch for it amen amen
[1:17:42] if you're not good at if you're not if
[1:17:44] you don't stretch a lot you'll catch a
[1:17:45] cramp doing that
[1:17:47] and i've seen people catch spiritual
[1:17:48] cramps and lock up trying to stretch
[1:17:52] forward into spiritual things
[1:17:54] you see because this is a lifestyle
[1:17:56] friends this is a this is an everyday
[1:17:59] relationship that you have to work on
[1:18:01] every day of your life
[1:18:03] you should always be making progress you
[1:18:06] should always be going forward you
[1:18:07] should always be improving amen this is
[1:18:11] what god has for you don't never
[1:18:13] settle for mediocrity and bear in mind
[1:18:17] that excellence becomes mediocrity later
[1:18:19] on if you don't keep pressing
[1:18:22] you see what i mean you say well i i
[1:18:24] tell you i got all these testimonies
[1:18:26] where i used to pray this many times a
[1:18:27] day and read my bible when i've read it
[1:18:29] this many times okay fine what are you
[1:18:30] doing today
[1:18:32] see
[1:18:33] because now if you're not if you haven't
[1:18:34] continued that on then then and why why
[1:18:37] do we do that why do we get these times
[1:18:39] where we we we we languish in lethargy
[1:18:43] and suddenly we come to church and
[1:18:45] somebody starts singing a song and we
[1:18:47] just start tapping our finger that's
[1:18:48] pretty good next thing you know you
[1:18:49] don't even know your toes tapping next
[1:18:51] thing you know you're clapping your
[1:18:52] hands you're starting to feel what's
[1:18:54] happening the holy spirit worship in
[1:18:56] song and starting to drive away spirits
[1:18:59] and then a preacher comes out and you're
[1:19:01] ripe and ready and the word comes and it
[1:19:03] starts washing you and you're like
[1:19:05] wow world what have i been doing oh my
[1:19:07] goodness praise the lord i want to go
[1:19:09] forward and you run out of here like
[1:19:11] like a mighty man of valor and and and
[1:19:14] the next day you're still a mighty man
[1:19:16] of valor and the next day you're still a
[1:19:18] mighty man of valor the next day what
[1:19:20] was i doing uh what mighty whatever what
[1:19:23] was i
[1:19:25] and then and then the next thing you
[1:19:26] know here goes two weeks three weeks
[1:19:28] where'd that mighty man of valor go and
[1:19:30] then you come back to another service
[1:19:31] and the lord starts you all over again
[1:19:33] that's that's crazy to live like that
[1:19:36] amen
[1:19:38] no wonder you don't have the wisdom you
[1:19:40] need and the power you need in the word
[1:19:42] of god because it's filled with wisdom
[1:19:45] and power see
[1:19:46] and so satan of course busy i get it
[1:19:48] he's always distracting us and filling
[1:19:51] us up with
[1:19:53] stuff
[1:19:54] of the world
[1:19:56] and and getting us off
[1:19:58] of the path and you know it requires
[1:20:00] forward motion it requires change you
[1:20:02] have to be willing to change i
[1:20:04] one of my one of my
[1:20:06] uh at the very top of my doctor's bag i
[1:20:09] have a medicine in it when when i get
[1:20:12] married couples coming to see me i
[1:20:13] haven't had one a long time so don't
[1:20:15] think i'm talking about you
[1:20:16] but
[1:20:17] who who said and i can see that they're
[1:20:19] just at odds with each other and i'm
[1:20:21] trying to get to the bottom of it and
[1:20:23] you know here she's sitting with her
[1:20:25] arms crossed and he's looking out the
[1:20:26] window and and i'm trying to say okay
[1:20:29] you know well what's what's wrong here
[1:20:32] and you know and right away you know
[1:20:34] one of them sure enough sure shoot and
[1:20:36] one of them will say the magic word i'm
[1:20:38] just waiting to hear it
[1:20:41] he's changed
[1:20:44] she's changed too he's not the man i'm
[1:20:47] married
[1:20:48] yeah that's right i'll tell you when i
[1:20:50] married her is this this and this and
[1:20:51] she's changed brother jason
[1:20:54] i'm i'm sitting there like
[1:20:56] praise the lord
[1:21:00] like what
[1:21:01] i said change is the most fundamental
[1:21:03] progress is the most fundamental part of
[1:21:05] a marriage relationship it means you're
[1:21:08] evolving
[1:21:09] well okay sister so you married him he
[1:21:11] was 21 and probably still kind of had
[1:21:13] some boy ways in him and now he's 28 you
[1:21:15] still want him to act like he's 21
[1:21:18] no well then you'd appreciate his
[1:21:19] changing right yeah i guess i would
[1:21:21] excuse me sir when you married her she
[1:21:23] could barely scorch water
[1:21:25] but now she's become a
[1:21:26] a chef do you want her to go back no so
[1:21:29] you glad she changed oh yeah i'm glad
[1:21:31] she changed
[1:21:33] so change is necessary change and nobody
[1:21:36] likes that
[1:21:38] people don't like change people like
[1:21:40] comfort okay i've got my life i've got
[1:21:42] my comfort zone i'm this i'm that don't
[1:21:45] change nothing i like it just the way it
[1:21:47] is i give you my word god will wreck it
[1:21:50] and change you
[1:21:52] because you say why will he do it
[1:21:54] because you're not raptured yet and he's
[1:21:55] not trying to make you comfortable here
[1:21:57] he's trying to make you comfortable
[1:21:59] there
[1:22:01] you understand so we'll rest in the
[1:22:03] millennium but right here it requires
[1:22:05] that we press
[1:22:07] it requires that we be willing to change
[1:22:09] it requires that we be willing to
[1:22:11] advance
[1:22:13] fact is if you're not you become
[1:22:14] stagnant
[1:22:16] and and you know
[1:22:18] the the the the river of life is not a
[1:22:21] stagnant pond amen now i i fully get
[1:22:25] that still water
[1:22:28] uh is a bible he leadeth me beside the
[1:22:31] still water but that's deep water that's
[1:22:34] an artesian
[1:22:35] well doing that that and i've been to
[1:22:38] artisan wells i've been to the artesian
[1:22:40] spring brother branham talked about
[1:22:41] bubbling and don't always bubble
[1:22:43] sometimes it rolls sometimes it's very
[1:22:45] still it just depends on the rain and
[1:22:47] what's pushing from under underground
[1:22:49] but no matter when the time i went and
[1:22:51] it was quite still but i could still see
[1:22:53] it was moving
[1:22:55] and it was feeding out through the
[1:22:56] farmer's field and going down to who
[1:22:58] knows where
[1:22:59] and you couldn't plug it up you tried it
[1:23:01] blow up somewhere else
[1:23:03] because so so and i mean i i granted
[1:23:08] nature finds a way
[1:23:10] there's life form
[1:23:12] in a stagnant pond but that's not
[1:23:14] for you
[1:23:16] you're a seven colored rainbow trout the
[1:23:18] stagnant pond's not you there might be
[1:23:20] life in there nature people find a way
[1:23:22] to exist and live how they go by and
[1:23:25] face day to day i don't know but that's
[1:23:27] not the bride your breath your life is
[1:23:30] to be vibrant and moving and and and
[1:23:33] warm and lush and healthy and vigorous
[1:23:37] you're to be producing you're to be
[1:23:40] accomplishing you're to be moving and
[1:23:42] progressing
[1:23:44] see
[1:23:45] and that requires change people don't
[1:23:47] like that
[1:23:49] heraclitus said i believe that all
[1:23:52] things pass
[1:23:53] and nothing stays
[1:23:56] and comparing existing things to the
[1:23:58] flow of a river he says you should not
[1:24:01] step twice into the same river that
[1:24:03] plato said that you should never be able
[1:24:05] to step twice in the in a river in the
[1:24:07] same place in the river because why it's
[1:24:08] moving
[1:24:10] it's always moving no matter where you
[1:24:12] set your foot you're going to step in
[1:24:13] water but pull it out and step it back
[1:24:14] in you got new water because that water
[1:24:16] you previously stepped in has already
[1:24:17] gone downstream
[1:24:19] you said i mean
[1:24:20] so so one constant
[1:24:24] since the beginning of time might be
[1:24:25] change
[1:24:27] and a lot of times that's not as bad as
[1:24:29] the fear of change
[1:24:32] and people oftentimes are very much
[1:24:35] afraid
[1:24:36] of
[1:24:37] of change you know the fear of change is
[1:24:40] also a constant
[1:24:42] i just want to say that to you it's also
[1:24:44] a constant you know since since since
[1:24:47] the beginning of time since genesis we
[1:24:50] find that humans tend to like routine
[1:24:53] because it makes us feel comfortable in
[1:24:55] our lives
[1:24:56] you know i remember brother don had to
[1:24:58] get up here uh many years ago and had to
[1:25:01] make an announcement as a deacon from
[1:25:03] this pulpit to say listen y'all this
[1:25:05] ain't yankee stadium
[1:25:08] you don't have reserve seating

[1:25:57] you can't even see around him
[1:25:59] and and so
[1:26:01] so she's she's moving and i finally said
[1:26:03] i said mom do you want to sit on the
[1:26:05] platform
[1:26:06] it'll be okay the church will allow it
[1:26:09] come on mom i'll you can sit up here
[1:26:11] beside with beside me and uh and we'll
[1:26:14] give you a special place
[1:26:16] but you know um
[1:26:18] we like routine and
[1:26:20] when the fear of change
[1:26:22] becomes they they actually have a and i
[1:26:24] don't know that i can pronounce this
[1:26:26] meta uh
[1:26:29] metathesiophobia it's actually
[1:26:31] um the persistent abnormal and
[1:26:34] unwarranted fear of change
[1:26:37] it becomes doesn't start out all the
[1:26:39] time but it can become a phobia see
[1:26:42] and literally you know people
[1:26:45] uh they they tend to
[1:26:47] live in the past and are unwilling to
[1:26:49] progress which often leads to depression
[1:26:51] often ruins careers whole careers have
[1:26:53] been lost
[1:26:54] by people unwilling
[1:26:56] you know uh it can seriously impact your
[1:26:59] lives both personally and professionally
[1:27:03] you know if a society or a or or a
[1:27:06] country
[1:27:07] rejects change then there's no growth
[1:27:10] if a church rejects change now i'm not
[1:27:13] talking about
[1:27:15] changing the word of god
[1:27:17] but what i am saying to you is that if
[1:27:20] we
[1:27:20] believe the word of god we're moving
[1:27:24] forward
[1:27:25] amen always
[1:27:27] upward and onward that's my point to you
[1:27:31] so don't let your life become stagnant
[1:27:35] just because you
[1:27:37] it's more comfortable to sit back
[1:27:42] it's more comfortable to sit back
[1:27:44] it's hey it's more comfortable to sit at
[1:27:47] home and stream a service
[1:27:49] and it's very easy to hide behind the to
[1:27:52] hide behind a pandemic i i people that
[1:27:55] do that don't have any problem going to
[1:27:57] grocery stores
[1:27:58] restaurants you know whatever yeah but
[1:28:02] yeah and and i sister debbie and i were
[1:28:03] talking about this the other day and she
[1:28:04] was watching one of her cooking shows
[1:28:06] and the ladies a good baptist lady and
[1:28:09] she was talking about i think her
[1:28:10] husband's a pastor and
[1:28:12] and he got oh he got on there talking
[1:28:14] about how same thing i mean you think
[1:28:15] these things where i can get prayed for
[1:28:17] somewhere where demons are a little
[1:28:19] afraid to come into you know because the
[1:28:21] power of god might expose them they
[1:28:22] don't like being exposed
[1:28:24] and so
[1:28:26] so we we have to we can't allow
[1:28:29] our lives to become stagnant i mean if
[1:28:32] you think about if you think about job's
[1:28:34] life job went to church every day i'm
[1:28:37] sorry uh enoch enoch went to church
[1:28:40] every day that pyramid was his church
[1:28:43] the great pyramid now listen friends
[1:28:45] that's not a virtual pyramid amen
[1:28:48] he didn't build that thing at home
[1:28:50] watching it online
[1:28:53] he had to go build it
[1:28:55] you follow me
[1:28:56] so that's not a virtual pyramid that
[1:28:58] thing's real you can go up brother
[1:28:59] michael's seen it
[1:29:00] you you can actually go there
[1:29:02] and so so so so we realized that that
[1:29:06] we've got to be you know up and moving
[1:29:09] up and at it jesus said pray you're the
[1:29:11] lord of the harvest that he'll send
[1:29:13] forth laborers and people don't want to
[1:29:16] be sent forth and they don't want to
[1:29:17] labor and god wants you to do both
[1:29:20] see
[1:29:21] so we've got to always be willing to go
[1:29:25] forward
[1:29:26] when you're finished changing said
[1:29:28] benjamin franklin once when you are
[1:29:30] finished changing you are finished
[1:29:36] so brother branham makes this statement
[1:29:38] into whom would we go
[1:29:40] he said you tell me somewhere or
[1:29:42] someplace that you could go
[1:29:45] or something you could do
[1:29:48] or something you could achieve that
[1:29:50] would be everlasting outside of jesus
[1:29:52] christ

[1:29:56] would be everlasting tell me if you
[1:29:58] could build a popularity be eternal
[1:30:02] tell me

[1:30:05] eternal riches you cannot do it nothing
[1:30:07] outside of jesus christ
[1:30:09] he is the eternal achievement what a
[1:30:12] term
[1:30:14] jesus is the eternal achievement and if
[1:30:18] you have achieved ever so much in your
[1:30:20] life you have never achieved the eternal
[1:30:23] thing yet until you have found christ
[1:30:26] jesus and have got him in your heart he
[1:30:30] is the eternal
[1:30:32] achievement amen amen i i caught a
[1:30:36] headline just yesterday the day before

[1:32:26] would be eternal tell me you could get
[1:32:27] enough riches that be eternal riches you

[1:32:56] for that and start reaching for
[1:32:57] something higher
[1:32:59] start being ready to move forward
[1:33:02] in christ we're almost out of here
[1:33:05] we're almost home time this is no time
[1:33:08] to be languishing back in laodicea yeah
[1:33:11] get up in adelaide to see it press hard
[1:33:14] press high
[1:33:16] we're challenged this hour i i
[1:33:19] understand humans since them and more
[1:33:21] time immemorial don't like progress they
[1:33:24] don't like change humans like comfort of
[1:33:26] familiarity don't change anything please
[1:33:30] but you become stagnant doing that
[1:33:33] you become stagnant i don't have time to
[1:33:35] get to the rest of my sermon but i just
[1:33:37] want to
[1:33:38] i just want to put that in your heart
[1:33:39] today
[1:33:41] so firmly
[1:33:42] before i close that god
[1:33:45] is on the move
[1:33:48] amen
[1:33:49] he's on the move
[1:33:51] friends
[1:33:53] young people
[1:33:54] he's on the move
[1:33:57] we realized friend you talking about
[1:34:00] change
[1:34:01] and i wanted to go in today to deal with
[1:34:03] some of the things around the sixth seal
[1:34:04] and i wanted to go down and read some
[1:34:06] parallel verses i'll get to it next time
[1:34:09] for sure i'll definitely get to it
[1:34:10] because it's exciting
[1:34:11] amen
[1:34:13] but change is coming
[1:34:16] the world you're in is changing every
[1:34:18] day
[1:34:19] amen
[1:34:20] you think god's not
[1:34:22] i don't mean changing in his nature he
[1:34:23] doesn't change in his characteristics
[1:34:25] that's the beauty
[1:34:28] that that ought to overcome all your
[1:34:30] fears
[1:34:31] to progress
[1:34:33] because he's the same yesterday and
[1:34:35] forever
[1:34:37] and so really when you think about it
[1:34:39] that way i can say to you
[1:34:41] you're not at risk to give up your
[1:34:44] comfortable mediocrity
[1:34:47] you're only at risk trying to stay in
[1:34:50] your level of mediocrity
[1:34:52] because if you stay there that's not an
[1:34:55] eagle
[1:34:56] you understand and since you are an
[1:34:58] eagle but you're not acting like an
[1:35:00] eagle then yeah god will bring the
[1:35:04] loving his tender hand of correction on
[1:35:07] your life it won't have nothing to do
[1:35:09] with curses or plagues or anything like
[1:35:11] that or judgment it's just god child
[1:35:14] training
[1:35:16] so
[1:35:17] so so
[1:35:18] you know sometimes in our lives we just
[1:35:21] we just have to embrace it because you
[1:35:23] can't stop change amen
[1:35:25] the world is changing they would love
[1:35:27] they they they talk fondly uh brother
[1:35:30] josh turned me on to a wonderful
[1:35:32] historical podcast wow brother josh
[1:35:34] wherever you are i'm loving that
[1:35:36] and and and and this man is just going
[1:35:39] back you know through history and one of
[1:35:41] the things that he's dealt with looking
[1:35:43] back into world war ii and the the
[1:35:45] players during that epic uh saga of
[1:35:48] human history
[1:35:49] is they're they're always
[1:35:52] you know always longing to get back to
[1:35:54] the good old days he said which
[1:35:56] generally didn't really exist
[1:35:58] amen
[1:36:00] that we we gloss it over we have a
[1:36:02] fondness all the good old days
[1:36:04] there's never been any good old days
[1:36:07] a man i don't care what year it say no
[1:36:10] but i remember man you know in the 50s
[1:36:12] and and there was such pro but listen i
[1:36:15] don't care what age you put it in
[1:36:17] man born of a woman is a few days and
[1:36:20] full of trouble
[1:36:22] that's always going to be true stop
[1:36:24] chasing this life because man that's
[1:36:26] born of a woman and i'm sure you didn't
[1:36:28] get here if you weren't
[1:36:30] man that's born of a woman is just a few
[1:36:32] days and full of trouble
[1:36:36] and the world really is falling apart
[1:36:38] it's not just in your mind
[1:36:40] it's not it's not fake news the world is
[1:36:43] falling
[1:36:44] apart
[1:36:46] and the players who are in control over
[1:36:48] the world are trying to break it they're
[1:36:52] trying to destroy it because it's a
[1:36:54] power grab that's not conspiracy that's
[1:36:56] prophecy
[1:36:57] that's right off the tape brother
[1:36:58] branham said that he said the money
[1:37:00] we're giving away to all these other
[1:37:02] nations brother madam said giving away
[1:37:04] money we don't have and can't collect
[1:37:06] taxes on it for multiple generations he
[1:37:08] said they
[1:37:10] the establishment presumably they are
[1:37:13] trying to break it
[1:37:15] why because the false prophet rules
[1:37:18] through commerce
[1:37:20] and craft and business
[1:37:23] and money
[1:37:24] see
[1:37:25] i mean that's coming friends let me and
[1:37:27] you think you think they've passed laws
[1:37:29] now
[1:37:30] and it doesn't even matter you can win
[1:37:31] court cases here's a man
[1:37:33] and woman i forget what it was they do i
[1:37:36] think wedding cakes and they didn't want
[1:37:39] to make a wedding cake for a gay couple
[1:37:41] because it violated their protestant
[1:37:43] beliefs and they the city shut them down
[1:37:47] the lower courts ruled against them the
[1:37:49] medium courts ruled against them the
[1:37:50] federal courts ruled against them the
[1:37:52] the appellate courts ruled against them
[1:37:54] and only when it finally got to a mostly
[1:37:57] conservative supreme court they finally
[1:37:58] won
[1:38:00] you think that you think that stop the
[1:38:01] devil not at all then the next time
[1:38:03] here's another man and woman take a
[1:38:05] stand on their religious beliefs and
[1:38:06] they won't have anything to do with the
[1:38:08] homosexual union and right away here
[1:38:10] goes the city shutting them down here
[1:38:12] goes the same courts same lower courts
[1:38:14] medium courts higher court state courts
[1:38:16] federal courts appellate courts and it
[1:38:17] goes all the way to supreme court again
[1:38:19] took years these people spent millions
[1:38:21] of dollars
[1:38:22] all to hear the supreme court go no
[1:38:24] you're okay
[1:38:25] you say okay now surely they'll never
[1:38:27] try that again it's already in the news
[1:38:29] already in the news here's a man and
[1:38:31] woman with a farm and they they do
[1:38:33] weddings
[1:38:34] at their farm because it's beautiful and
[1:38:36] they're
[1:38:37] they're catholic and and that might save
[1:38:40] them because they're catholic
[1:38:42] because it's hard for them to fight
[1:38:43] against them being being catholic
[1:38:45] and they the city shutting them down you
[1:38:47] can't sell your stuff at farmers markets
[1:38:49] anymore because you won't do a gay
[1:38:50] wedding they said well it's against
[1:38:52] god's word it's against our truly held
[1:38:54] religious beliefs no your business we're
[1:38:58] a farm we're private farm yeah but
[1:38:59] you're not going to come in here and
[1:39:00] lansing and do business with us we the
[1:39:02] mayor gets on there and said if you want
[1:39:04] to be a bigot we don't want you
[1:39:08] so i believe this makes me a bigot
[1:39:12] i want to say to the world to you to the
[1:39:15] internet

[1:39:19] it makes you a believer
[1:39:21] it makes you a godly christian person
[1:39:25] and i don't care what the world in their
[1:39:27] nasty ways wants to call normal if this
[1:39:30] doesn't call it normal i'm going to say
[1:39:32] it's not normal
[1:39:34] and i don't care what they think and we
[1:39:36] don't i don't need their support
[1:39:40] because i you say well how will you live
[1:39:42] i know that wherever the carcass is

[1:40:05] change is rushing to meet us
[1:40:08] and the only path for the believer is up
[1:40:12] amen
[1:40:13] and sometimes
[1:40:15] we need to find ourselves
[1:40:17] a little more inclined to
[1:40:19] up
[1:40:21] stand
[1:40:25] sometimes
[1:40:27] maybe you're here today

[1:41:35] the administrators of god's
[1:41:38] righteousness

[1:41:45] i want to go upward
[1:41:49] be prepared
[1:41:50] because the only path
[1:41:53] for the believer is up
[1:41:56] and that's my last line and the last
[1:41:58] line i wrote in my notes
[1:42:00] sometimes we need to find ourselves more
[1:42:02] inclined to up
[1:42:06] and i sit and stare at that line and i
[1:42:08] and i said
[1:42:09] you too boy
[1:42:11] i need to be more inclined to up
[1:42:14] how many want to be more inclined to up
[1:42:17] satan will never let you have that kind
[1:42:20] of trajectory he'll just want you to be
[1:42:23] like this
[1:42:24] because he knows
[1:42:26] that because time is moving and because
[1:42:28] prophecy is moving then you're on a
[1:42:30] moving treadmill
[1:42:32] and nothing's standing still not
[1:42:34] prophecy
[1:42:35] it's not standing still
[1:42:37] you ever stood still on a moving
[1:42:38] treadmill
[1:42:40] it doesn't end well
[1:42:43] you so if you stop if you get
[1:42:46] comfortable and you stop in your
[1:42:48] spiritual
[1:42:49] uh
[1:42:50] moisture your spiritual relationship
[1:42:53] your spiritual strength your daily
[1:42:55] spiritual diet your spiritual prayer
[1:42:58] life and you
[1:42:59] you fill all that up with stuff
[1:43:04] jobs
[1:43:06] education entertainments recreation and
[1:43:10] all you have
[1:43:11] is stuff
[1:43:14] you're going to find yourself
[1:43:16] backsliding
[1:43:17] you're going to find yourself cold and
[1:43:19] powerless i didn't say you're not going
[1:43:20] to be a son or daughter of god i said
[1:43:22] you're going to be an underachieving
[1:43:24] low expectation believer
[1:43:28] and you're never going to and that's hey
[1:43:30] that's one thing if you're a young
[1:43:32] teenager and you got people taking care
[1:43:33] of you but if you're a father or a
[1:43:35] husband if you're a wife or a mom
[1:43:40] and you got people responsible let me
[1:43:41] tell you something brothers sisters we

[1:44:15] sing that song again i'd
[1:44:18] keep your heads bowed i i i couldn't

[1:44:54] tapes and i've read my bible and i've

[1:45:14] your inspiration and i can see the
[1:45:17] effect it's had on the people listening
[1:45:19] and i am completely positive there are
[1:45:22] those listening online today father
[1:45:25] who
[1:45:26] who have who have realized
[1:45:29] that
[1:45:31] progress is necessary
[1:45:34] that catastrophic change is rushing to
[1:45:36] meet us
