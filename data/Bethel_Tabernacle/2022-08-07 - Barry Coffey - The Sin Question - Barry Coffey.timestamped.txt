[32:44] you know a lot of times we ask questions
[32:46] within ourselves and among ourselves
[32:48] about why this sister Solas why she just
[32:51] given birth to a new baby has three
[32:54] other uh small children
[33:00] the brother Michael who's her husband
[33:03] just was laid off his job so they're out
[33:06] of insurance coverage
[33:08] and you kind of think how how did they
[33:11] not know how why her why now brother
[33:16] Branham said don't do that he said what
[33:18] we need to do is only believe
[33:20] that's what he said
[33:22] brother Burley is today he wrote me and
[33:25] told me he said I can't still can't see
[33:27] out of that left eye
[33:29] that nail hit him and he said but you
[33:33] know he said brother Barry he said I'm
[33:34] not worried I have a piece and he said I
[33:36] have a just a consolation that God's
[33:39] still on the throne and he said I'm not
[33:40] worried about it at all
[33:42] and I said we're going to pray for you
[33:44] brother Burley every day we're going to
[33:45] pray out loud
[33:46] trust that God will touch you and that's
[33:50] God's servant and so the best thing we
[33:53] can do and the best thing you can do is
[33:55] take your need and bring it to him this
[33:57] morning so before we do anything else
[33:59] let's speak to him
[34:00] Heavenly Father we've prayed several
[34:03] times already this morning but I would
[34:05] just like to add my voice
[34:07] and ask your blessing Lord upon this
[34:09] service today I feel like we've already
[34:11] been blessed Lord and just being in the
[34:14] house of the Lord and such a sweet
[34:16] atmosphere and lovely singing father we
[34:20] ask now that you would just take
[34:21] complete control and breathe upon your
[34:24] word this is your word these are your
[34:27] people and I pray you bring the two
[34:29] together now
[34:30] and speak as only you can we commit the
[34:33] many needs Lord that are represented
[34:36] Among Us I commit them to you especially
[34:39] the serious ones Lord that we've talked
[34:41] about and we just want to only believe
[34:43] that all things are possible
[34:45] have your way we pray in Jesus lovely
[34:47] name
[34:48] amen and amen praise the Lord you can be
[34:52] seated for a moment
[34:54] I'll have you standing again in just a
[34:56] moment but musicians thank you you can
[34:58] take your seats there and let's pull up
[35:01] my PowerPoint here if you don't mind
[35:03] and uh I just want to say at the outset
[35:06] my wife and I are always honored to be
[35:08] able to come and spend time with brother
[35:10] Jason sister Debbie and the family in
[35:13] the church and we don't get to do it
[35:15] real often these days but uh we are
[35:18] honored to be able to be with you today
[35:20] and this weekend and uh appreciate the
[35:23] hospitality and the good Fellowship that
[35:25] we always enjoy good to see familiar
[35:27] faces and uh many of you haven't seen in
[35:30] a while but uh like I heard brother
[35:32] Downey say the other day he said you
[35:34] look out the congregation see these
[35:36] folks they've gotten old
[35:37] some of them gotten older and hasn't
[35:40] happened to me
[35:42] because I believe that old age is always
[35:45] five years older than what you are
[35:48] so that's the way I that's the way I
[35:51] look at it now
[35:53] um let's let's do this let's uh slide
[35:55] that ahead there if you don't mind we'll
[35:57] come back to the screen again in a
[35:58] moment here and uh
[36:01] this there we go just a note here that
[36:04] Lord willing we're we're planning uh
[36:07] we're in the final process of planning a
[36:10] trip to Israel in November 23 so it'll
[36:13] be a year from this November and there's
[36:16] a lot of interest there and if if you're
[36:18] interested in doing something like that
[36:20] I think every believer would enjoy a
[36:23] trip to Israel it makes your Bible a
[36:24] different book and uh to be able to go
[36:27] and see not only the past the historical
[36:30] part of Israel but to see prophetically
[36:32] where things are going it's an exciting
[36:34] uh adventure for sure so you can let me
[36:38] know
[36:39] and we'd be certainly honored to have
[36:42] you with us as you know we've been uh
[36:44] involved in the nation of Ukraine uh
[36:48] recently I was there in last September
[36:50] and held a meeting there in the region
[36:53] called The Sea of azov which is on the
[36:56] Black Sea and there are still to our
[36:58] estimation about 120 families that are
[37:01] still little trapped inside Ukraine and
[37:04] their situation is difficult and by
[37:06] God's grace we've been able to channel
[37:08] funds directly to them next Sunday night
[37:11] we're going to have a meeting where we
[37:12] have some people who are from Russia and
[37:15] uh in Ukraine uh who are going to be
[37:18] with us in service in the afternoon and
[37:20] we're going to be given a little special
[37:22] report on on the situation there but
[37:25] this is just a kind of a typical scene
[37:28] from over there and in zaparosa and
[37:32] they're kind of right in the thick of
[37:33] things and you should remember despite
[37:37] all the media and the way things are
[37:39] portrayed you should just remember these
[37:42] Believers in Ukraine they're very solid
[37:45] people very wonderful people and we sure
[37:47] love them now I don't know what happened
[37:50] here but let's just
[37:53] wow
[37:55] this is the nation of Zambia and this is
[37:59] kind of a remote section of Zambia and
[38:02] doing the work with vision books these
[38:06] folks are now receiving new materials
[38:08] they've got if you look in their hand
[38:10] they've got different titles there uh
[38:12] single sermons they have the seals book
[38:14] Church age book all of this is in their
[38:16] language of bimba
[38:18] and most of you don't speak bimba and uh
[38:22] but there's about uh they say about uh
[38:25] three to four million people who speak
[38:27] bimba in that part of the world and
[38:29] there's many Believers over there so
[38:31] they have not had materials in their
[38:33] hands like this for years and years and
[38:35] years and years and so they're very
[38:37] excited about receiving this this new
[38:39] material
[38:40] and uh by God's grace that's that's been
[38:43] ongoing and uh moving all over the place
[38:45] now I don't know what happened here we
[38:47] lost some of our our pictures here I
[38:49] just had a couple of more uh but either
[38:51] way we're here
[38:53] and uh so uh let's begin and if you
[38:57] don't mind uh we'll have you stand to
[38:59] your feet and
[39:01] we'll look in two places in the
[39:03] scripture and we're gonna go uh to
[39:05] Joshua chapter four first of all Joshua
[39:08] the fourth chapter
[39:18] thank you
[39:23] and we'd like to begin reading here
[39:32] in the fourth chapter of Joshua and this
[39:35] is the the passage where the the story
[39:37] where uh the children of Israel have all
[39:40] cleaned past over Jordans what it says
[39:42] in verse one and they're on the other
[39:44] side they're on the uh they're on the uh
[39:48] Israel side of of the river in verse 5
[39:52] Joshua said unto them Passover before
[39:53] the Ark of the Lord your God into the
[39:56] midst of Jordan and taking up every man
[39:58] of you a stone upon his shoulder so it's
[40:01] 12 men standing on on the bank of the
[40:03] river and they go through and grab a
[40:04] stone according to the number of the
[40:06] tribes of the children of Israel that
[40:09] this may be a sign a memorial among you
[40:12] that when your children ask their
[40:14] fathers in time to come saying
[40:17] what mean ye by these stones
[40:20] then you shall answer them
[40:22] that the Waters of Jordan were cut off
[40:24] before the Ark of the Covenant of the
[40:26] Lord when it passed over Jordan the
[40:28] Waters of Jordan were cut off and these
[40:31] Stones shall be a memorial unto the
[40:33] children of Israel and the children of
[40:34] Israel did so as Joshua commanded and
[40:37] took up 12 Stones Out of the midst of
[40:38] Jordan as the Lord spake unto Joshua
[40:41] according to the number of tribes of the
[40:43] children of Israel and carried them over
[40:45] with them unto the place where they
[40:47] lodged and they laid them down there
[40:51] now this was not their destiny
[40:54] right to be on the banks of the river
[40:56] this was not where they were going to
[40:58] stop this was a memorial of what God did
[41:01] to get them there all right and so he
[41:03] wanted them to remember this place by
[41:05] this Memorial and and put these Stones
[41:07] there and and always remember that God
[41:11] did a great thing here and he wanted the
[41:14] children of Israel to remember that but
[41:15] the idea was that in time to come your
[41:17] children are going to ask you questions
[41:18] and when they do he said you fathers
[41:21] that are gathered he said you tell them
[41:23] this is what happened here now over in
[41:26] Romans chapter 3 and verse 23 and you
[41:30] could all probably quote this
[41:36] for all have sinned and come short of
[41:38] the glory of God being justified freely
[41:40] by his grace through the Redemption that
[41:42] is in Christ Jesus
[41:44] may God add his Blessing to the reading
[41:46] of his word you may be seated this
[41:48] morning
[41:51] now if we can get our screen back up
[41:53] there I'd like to
[41:56] I'd like to jump right in here and uh
[41:59] I'm going to ask you to uh just follow
[42:02] me here as we begin to look at this in
[42:06] um
[42:10] in this morning's context here now let
[42:13] me just uh Bridge a little between last
[42:17] night and this morning here and uh I'm
[42:20] sorry to put so much information in
[42:22] there last night I know some of you were
[42:23] looking at me like is this required for
[42:25] the test and uh but you you have you
[42:29] have the PowerPoint now just trying to
[42:30] cover a lot of ground uh in order to
[42:32] leave things with you here but I just
[42:34] felt uh this morning just to take a
[42:36] little bit of a turn a little bit of a
[42:38] Twist here so that uh we'll we'll go at
[42:40] this from another angle and as a
[42:43] Christian family in today's world it's
[42:46] really important for us to establish
[42:48] priorities for our family and we want to
[42:51] develop first of all faith and spiritual
[42:54] uh principles uh issues in our house as
[42:57] for me and my house we serve the Lord
[42:58] well what does that mean well that means
[43:00] we're going to be a tithe-paying
[43:02] household right we're going to put God
[43:04] first in our finances or uh we're going
[43:06] to uh you know we're going to uh read
[43:10] the word daily we're going to have a
[43:11] family devotion or whatever else we're
[43:13] going to establish certain priorities
[43:14] and make things first in other words we
[43:17] might say well we have family visiting
[43:19] from abroad and they might not be
[43:21] Believers but you know what we're going
[43:22] to go to church anyway wow
[43:25] wow should I not have said that
[43:28] um to me I I I I just we don't we never
[43:32] we in our in our household we just never
[43:34] let a whole lot of things interrupt the
[43:37] the the the routine of going to church I
[43:40] mean it was just hey that's first you
[43:42] know and so uh if they want to come
[43:44] great if they want to stay great there's
[43:46] lots of food in the fridge you know but
[43:48] uh hey we're going to church that's
[43:49] that's who we are is what we do uh in in
[43:52] our house we made decisions about like
[43:55] when we were when our kids were really
[43:56] young it was when the uh you know
[43:59] computers were changing and the internet
[44:00] was coming and all of that and we said
[44:02] we're just not going to focus a whole
[44:04] lot on video on computer games now back
[44:07] then there was only two uh one was the
[44:10] Pac-Man the guy who went like this right
[44:12] and ate everything and the other one was
[44:14] Oregon Trail we turned Oregon Trail into
[44:16] a school event so the kids didn't want
[44:18] to play that and then the other this
[44:21] this guy we just kind of let him go by
[44:22] the wayside now as a result of that our
[44:24] guys became great readers and uh you
[44:28] know they're now today they're very
[44:30] proficient readers and uh you know I was
[44:32] just it was a good decision we never
[44:34] knew the full effect of that decision
[44:35] when we made it we just thought it'd be
[44:37] a good thing but we we put priorities in
[44:39] place and and you got to be proactive in
[44:41] doing that uh if you've never done us a
[44:44] good time to do it and then we developed
[44:46] a Biblical order uh as we said that that
[44:49] we're going to make spiritual things
[44:50] priorities we're going to uh learn about
[44:53] how our finances and how to structure
[44:56] things in a good way and if we don't
[44:58] know we're going to find out we're going
[45:00] to draw from the resources I will
[45:01] guarantee you looking around you have
[45:03] somebody here who knows what they're
[45:04] doing in relation to finances and uh we
[45:07] we explored and and learned and grew and
[45:10] did it ourselves and then shared the uh
[45:13] benefit of that with uh with the church
[45:15] members we we established standards and
[45:19] boundaries and those are good to have
[45:20] the Bible talks about Hedges and hedges
[45:23] are not designed to Rob joy and fun out
[45:25] of your life they're meant to protect
[45:27] you because the Bible says that on the
[45:29] other side of a hedge is trouble and you
[45:30] don't want to get out there in trouble
[45:32] and so we we believed in heaven
[45:35] boundaries like and and that meant that
[45:37] we said we're not we're not going to
[45:39] participate in sleepovers
[45:42] we just never did now I'm not saying you
[45:43] should or shouldn't I'm just saying that
[45:46] we we didn't do a lot of that with our
[45:48] guys if we were gonna if they were gonna
[45:50] go stay with somebody generally we went
[45:52] as well if they were going to be on a
[45:53] campout we went and stayed with them all
[45:56] right I I've spent a lot of a lot of
[45:58] nights in in the sleeping bag in a
[45:59] campout because my boys went through in
[46:02] The Scouting years and uh we we wanted
[46:05] to put boundaries in place so that they
[46:07] knew where their where their area of
[46:09] responsibility was and we tried to make
[46:12] that clear and then we allowed them to
[46:13] remove those boundaries out as they grew
[46:15] older and we tried to practice
[46:18] consistent discipline and try to be fair
[46:21] across the board I found that most often
[46:23] I got the best mileage and pardoned the
[46:27] pun but I got the best bang for the buck
[46:29] when I dealt with my boys one-on-one and
[46:33] it never really as profitable as shame
[46:35] your child in a crowd of
[46:37] siblings amen amen it very often doesn't
[46:40] work and so I would pull my boys aside
[46:43] and talk to them and deal with them and
[46:45] we just had a way of of dealing with
[46:46] discipline you you have you may have
[46:48] your ways this these are all sermons in
[46:50] themselves and if we had time we could
[46:52] go through it uh the the the other thing
[46:55] that in order to accomplish shalom in
[46:57] your household is to learn how to
[46:58] resolve differences in a way that uh the
[47:01] family can move on because there will be
[47:03] differences you're not all the same you
[47:05] don't all think the same and why do you
[47:08] think they have two heat and cool
[47:10] settings in a car nowadays right come on
[47:13] who who invented that but a woman
[47:15] because she she said to her husband hey
[47:17] you're freezing me out and he said I'm
[47:20] sweating to death over here and so we
[47:22] get your own controls all right that's a
[47:24] good idea where do you think those
[47:26] things came from
[47:28] amen uh so you're not the same you have
[47:31] you have uh you know men are different
[47:33] than women and you have uh you have
[47:35] differences and and there's differences
[47:37] as your children get older and uh you
[47:39] know they grow up and they have an
[47:41] opinion and they have a uh you know a
[47:43] thought process and so you have to learn
[47:46] to resolve differences in a way that
[47:47] they don't linger for years and years
[47:49] and years and years and we're still
[47:50] burying the hatchet in somebody's back
[47:52] uh 10 years after this event uh you know
[47:56] we we have to learn to resolve that and
[47:57] these are just some things that are uh
[47:59] that are priorities then you want to do
[48:01] whatever you can to maintain the
[48:02] atmosphere so that the holy spirit's
[48:04] always welcome to come by as we talked
[48:06] about it now brother Branham said it
[48:07] this way he said so we got to think of
[48:09] others that are coming on behind us
[48:12] he said these young people and so forth
[48:14] a place for our children and our
[48:15] daughters we don't want them out in the
[48:17] world in these things like that we want
[48:19] them girls raised like our mothers all
[48:21] right and he says and the Holy Spirit
[48:24] will make all the arrangements for that
[48:25] wow
[48:27] uh somebody's and the pastor will make
[48:30] all the arrangements for them
[48:33] it's not what it says
[48:34] you got to make arrangements for this
[48:37] you've got to learn to be proactive and
[48:39] say hey if we're going to create a a
[48:41] nice place for our young people and
[48:43] we're going to have our daughters raised
[48:44] like our mother then you know what we've
[48:46] got to make decisions we got to sit down
[48:48] and make arrangements for them it is not
[48:51] just automatic and I really disdain the
[48:53] attitude that says well we brought him
[48:55] to church you know and uh we I don't
[48:58] know what happened they just didn't turn
[48:59] out so well well it requires a little
[49:02] bit more than just having your carcass
[49:03] inside the this these four walls it's
[49:06] it's a life that's lived at home it's a
[49:09] a thirst that's created by your your uh
[49:11] integrity and your life and your uh way
[49:14] of living at home it has an effect on
[49:15] your children and so therefore brother
[49:17] bran I'm saying you you got to think
[49:18] about this you got to think about
[49:20] because uh today if if you don't uh get
[49:23] involved and and create that atmosphere
[49:25] in your home and work with your kids
[49:27] provide opportunities for them take them
[49:29] places and go to camps go to different
[49:31] uh things it's not all camps and it's
[49:34] not all uh religious events there are
[49:36] it's important for families to get
[49:38] together and have shared experiences
[49:40] that are enjoyable yeah
[49:42] hello that's all right to do
[49:45] yeah and uh you know to take your boys
[49:47] and go fishing by the river take your
[49:49] girls and and uh take them to a mall and
[49:51] give them 500 each and just let them
[49:53] have at it I mean those are fun things
[49:55] right you know some of you girls got
[49:57] your black belt in shopping and I know
[49:59] that so uh you but you there there are
[50:02] shared positive experiences that
[50:04] families need to have and uh if if we if
[50:08] we don't think about that and do it work
[50:11] and the responsibilities of this world
[50:13] will close in on top of you and your
[50:16] kids in a sense are squeezed out of that
[50:18] that picture so don't leave it to
[50:20] somebody else to make arrangements for
[50:22] that you need to think about that and be
[50:24] proactive and do it that's what brother
[50:26] Branham said now I love this passage
[50:28] here and uh I need you to take a look at
[50:31] it Deuteronomy 4 6 and 8 are important
[50:33] for you there are instructions that uh
[50:35] God gave to Moses to bring into the
[50:38] children of Israel uh and and and Prime
[50:41] them if you like before they cross over
[50:43] into the land Deuteronomy is interesting
[50:45] book because if you go back historically
[50:48] it's the book that Jesus most quoted out
[50:50] of when he was on the earth in his
[50:52] ministry it is a book of of instruction
[50:55] looking forward and God was actually
[50:58] teaching them how to live in another
[51:00] place
[51:01] which is exactly to me what the message
[51:03] does today it teaches us to live in
[51:06] eternity we live by the word here we're
[51:08] going to live by the word there so uh In
[51:11] this passage I love this he says Hear o
[51:13] Israel the Lord your God is one Lord
[51:15] that's a Shema and thou shalt love the
[51:17] Lord with all thine heart and with all
[51:19] thy soul and with all thy might and
[51:20] these words which I command thee this
[51:22] day shall be in thy children's heart
[51:26] that's not what it says
[51:28] this word that I command thee this day
[51:31] shall be in thine heart
[51:33] who's he speaking to he's speaking to
[51:35] fathers here he's speaking to men and
[51:38] first of all the words got to be in your
[51:40] heart before we go on to any other verse
[51:42] here it's got to be in your heart first
[51:45] before you communicate it to anybody
[51:47] else and then verse 7 thou shall teach
[51:50] them diligently unto thy children and
[51:53] shall talk to them without citizen thine
[51:54] house and when they'll walk Us by the
[51:56] way and when thou lie us down and when
[51:58] that rises up
[52:00] so in other words all the time now
[52:02] there's two kinds of speaking in the Old
[52:04] Testament and one of them is the
[52:05] pronouncement of prophets and it's like
[52:07] this thus saith the Lord Israel thou
[52:11] shall hearken unto the Lord thy God and
[52:14] thou shalt repent
[52:15] that's the utterance of a prophet it's
[52:18] formal it is meant for uh these serious
[52:21] dictates that prophets came and did like
[52:23] Elijah on top of Mount Carmel
[52:26] but you know what that's not what this
[52:29] says when it says that thou shalt speak
[52:31] unto thy children Thou shalt talk of
[52:33] them when thou sit us at thy table at
[52:36] your table you don't talk like that you
[52:38] don't say the saith the Lord
[52:41] wife Thou shalt make steak for supper
[52:46] lest you die
[52:52] and uh you know you don't have your
[52:54] children come and kneel before you and
[52:56] lay your hands on them and say thou
[52:58] Wicked Child yeah you know we we that's
[53:01] that's not what that means this word
[53:02] talk here it means the everyday ordinary
[53:05] conversation of people who are just
[53:06] living their life
[53:08] amen and that's the other kind of talk
[53:10] and and this is this is what he wanted
[53:12] him to do you you're not you're not
[53:14] formal all the time you just you know
[53:15] what you include God in everything you
[53:17] talk about you make him the center of
[53:19] things you don't try to add them in he's
[53:21] a center and everything else stems from
[53:24] that does that make sense and and then
[53:27] he says I love this little word in verse
[53:29] 7 here he says thou shall teach them
[53:30] diligently in the Hebrew this this uh
[53:33] word diligent it means sharpen
[53:36] now
[53:38] most of you guys know how to sharpen
[53:39] something like if you're going to
[53:40] sharpen a knife or something and what we
[53:42] would do is we'd take that knife and
[53:44] we'd
[53:45] kind of go like this are you going to
[53:46] whittle a stick or something else you're
[53:48] going to rub on it a little bit you're
[53:50] going to look at it
[53:51] you're gonna rub on it a little bit
[53:54] and then you're going to figure out okay
[53:56] this is good it's good to use do a
[53:59] little bit more
[54:00] I'm going to polish it a little bit
[54:02] and then we're going to use it and you
[54:04] know what after a little while by virtue
[54:05] of use it's going to become dull again
[54:07] you know what we do same thing again we
[54:10] go back and we sharpen it again
[54:13] that's the word diligently
[54:15] that's what he's saying right here thou
[54:17] shall teach thy children diligently
[54:20] because you know what they don't learn
[54:21] everything in one sitting amen get
[54:24] brother Barry down here and teach us
[54:25] everything we'll all know everything so
[54:27] we got it oh hell no it doesn't work
[54:28] that way
[54:29] you need him you need to have him back
[54:31] you need to have other folks back that
[54:33] will help your families and help you
[54:35] help strengthen your relationships you
[54:37] know what Because by the next time I
[54:39] come here happy you'll be pretty dull
[54:41] would have to go back and do it again
[54:44] you know how many times brother Brandon
[54:46] preached influence or how many times he
[54:48] preached Investments right
[54:51] yeah a lot of times you've just you know
[54:52] resharpening just going at it again
[54:54] going at it again
[54:57] and that's what he says thou shall teach
[54:59] them diligently unto thy children have
[55:01] patience work with it get it get it
[55:03] looking good get it usable put it in
[55:05] service and you know what you're going
[55:07] to go back expect to go back again and
[55:09] sharpen it again we're going to remind
[55:10] you of some of these principles here but
[55:13] you know what it's got to be in your
[55:14] heart first dad's it's got to be in your
[55:16] hearts first
[55:17] don't try to convert your kids and tell
[55:19] them to get off the internet when you're
[55:21] on a 23 hours a day right you cannot you
[55:25] cannot teach them uh to be financially
[55:28] responsible if you're buying all the
[55:30] toys that that come out well I maybe I
[55:33] shouldn't say that let's let's go on a
[55:35] little bit more now he says and thou
[55:37] shalt bind them for a sign upon thine
[55:39] hand and thou shall be as frontless
[55:40] between Thine Eyes which is the blinders
[55:43] that horses have and they put them there
[55:46] the black they're black and they prevent
[55:49] the horses from having any peripheral
[55:51] view of things that are going on if they
[55:53] want the horses to go in a certain
[55:54] direction they put those front let's
[55:56] there so the horses are focused on that
[55:58] direction
[55:59] and I will tell you what if if you let
[56:02] it and you don't use the the frontlets
[56:04] uh you're going to be distracted by all
[56:06] kinds of things that are going on in
[56:08] other places here God's got a Destiny
[56:10] for the people of God God's got a
[56:12] destiny he's got an intent for your
[56:14] family he's got a direction for all of
[56:16] us to walk in
[56:17] and you're better off minimizing the
[56:19] distractions that are so readily there
[56:22] to pull us away and thou shall write
[56:24] them upon the post of thy house you need
[56:26] to make sure that everybody coming in
[56:27] and out sees these things there and
[56:30] they're reminded of them continually all
[56:33] right so that's just two or three verses
[56:34] out of Deuteronomy chapter six it's full
[56:36] of things like that and it's really uh
[56:39] really good Sound Advice it's almost
[56:42] like God knew that we'd be able to talk
[56:44] about that even thousands of years later
[56:46] we'd be able to pull that out and talk
[56:48] about it in church today it's amazing
[56:50] what God knows isn't it God is smart all
[56:53] right the unwelcome Christ brother
[56:54] random said people say but we got other
[56:56] things to do we can't go to church too
[56:58] many kids to get ready he said take him
[57:00] anyhow yeah can I say it that way take
[57:03] him anyhow yeah duh
[57:07] well the neighbors might say something
[57:09] well what do you care about the
[57:10] neighbors say use every opportunity say
[57:14] it with me use every opportunity I'm
[57:18] giving you tools to use I'm giving you
[57:20] uh keys to put in place here get to
[57:23] Jesus that's the main thing don't be
[57:25] took up with the Affairs of the world
[57:26] come on
[57:28] don't be taken up with the sports of the
[57:31] world and everything else
[57:33] we spend too much time on those things
[57:36] make your way to him and when you get
[57:38] there pour out your soul to him the
[57:41] brother man said don't let silly excuses
[57:43] keep you away from that use every
[57:45] opportunity use what God's given you I
[57:47] love this statement here mothers and
[57:49] fathers if you have children they must
[57:50] come first our success is a country and
[57:53] your success as a family depends not on
[57:55] what happens in the white house but what
[57:57] happens in your house you know who said
[57:59] that Barbara Bush in 1990.
[58:02] bless her heart now here's a statement
[58:06] that you probably never stopped and
[58:08] looked at but this is perseverance I
[58:11] think in 1964 brother Branham says
[58:13] Little David David the king he says no
[58:16] doubt raised in a lovely believing home
[58:18] his father Jesse was a great man of God
[58:23] dot dot dot I put the dot dot dot in
[58:25] there because I got a question for you
[58:27] is anybody here know anything that Jesse
[58:29] ever did that would cause us to call him
[58:32] great
[58:34] is there anything about Giants going
[58:36] down is there anything about armies
[58:37] being slaughtered with a Jawbone or is
[58:40] there any any kind of Explorer
[58:42] Supernatural event in Jesse's life that
[58:43] you know of I mean do you know anything
[58:45] about Jesse's Jesse at all except that
[58:47] he had a bunch of boys
[58:49] and one of them was tall
[58:50] and he was David's father I mean is
[58:53] there anything else that you know that
[58:54] would cause you to call him a great man
[58:55] of God
[58:57] that stopped me when I saw that all
[58:59] right why is brother Brandon calling him
[59:00] a great man of God it would be an
[59:02] interesting search for you to go and
[59:04] find uh type that in great man of God or
[59:06] man of God and find out who brother
[59:09] Branham identifies as a great man of God
[59:11] it would be of interest to you to do
[59:13] that but Jesse was one of these and he
[59:15] said he's a great man of God can I go
[59:17] ahead and finish the sentence because
[59:18] this is going to tell us what he did all
[59:20] right so that brother random called him
[59:22] a great man of God all right are you
[59:23] ready fathers you ought to tune in now
[59:26] watch this
[59:27] Jesse was a great man of God no doubt
[59:30] gathered all those boys around at night
[59:32] and had family prayer before they went
[59:33] to bed
[59:34] and probably read the Scrolls and talked
[59:36] about great Jehovah that had opened up
[59:38] the Red Sea and all those things and
[59:40] that created faith and Faith come by
[59:43] hearing and hearing the word of God and
[59:45] Little David got to thinking on that
[59:48] here's Jesse now considered by God a
[59:50] great man of God you know why because he
[59:52] gathers the Boys At Night takes the
[59:54] Scrolls out lays the scroll down and
[59:56] says who'd like to have a story before
[59:58] we go to bed yeah Dad we would yeah we
[1:00:01] would we would what do you want to hear
[1:00:03] tonight about Moses crossing the Red Sea
[1:00:04] or do you want to hear about Adam in the
[1:00:06] garden or what do you want to hear oh
[1:00:07] yeah tell us about Moses going across
[1:00:09] the Red Sea so Jesse probably got up
[1:00:11] there and said you know here's Moses
[1:00:13] standing here on the point and looking
[1:00:15] back and seeing the Egyptian Army
[1:00:17] looking and seeing the sea on this side
[1:00:19] mountains on this side and you know I
[1:00:21] don't know I I'd tell you how I did it I
[1:00:23] acted it out I mean if if there was a
[1:00:26] giant gonna fall down I got up on the
[1:00:27] bed and you know and fell down now I
[1:00:30] don't do that now because my boys are in
[1:00:32] their 30s so they're they're less
[1:00:34] entertained by that now but plus it's
[1:00:37] also takes a lot longer for me to get up
[1:00:39] and I fall down
[1:00:41] so uh you know you you change you adjust
[1:00:44] over time but in the early days I mean I
[1:00:47] got up there and added I I you know I
[1:00:49] got a rock and I uh I bought a sling one
[1:00:51] time and I was in Israel and I got a
[1:00:53] rock and I slung it around and uh told
[1:00:55] the stories to the boys and they were
[1:00:57] they were all kind of young wow wow did
[1:00:59] that really happen and this is what
[1:01:01] Jesse did he's he's called by Brother
[1:01:03] Branham a great man of God because he
[1:01:06] did that to create faith in the heart of
[1:01:08] David
[1:01:09] now watch now here's the next part of
[1:01:11] the the same quote here uh it says and
[1:01:14] he was responsible David was responsible
[1:01:16] for those sheep and one day a lion came
[1:01:18] in and got one he thought oh what am I
[1:01:20] going to do am I going to tell father
[1:01:22] about his sheep missing and he happened
[1:01:24] to remember that my father read the
[1:01:26] Scrolls and told me that now he's
[1:01:28] probably 12 13 14. he's not shaving yet
[1:01:31] right he's still a young guy are you
[1:01:33] with me but he's out there on the field
[1:01:35] and he said he smells this line sees
[1:01:37] this line and he says my father read
[1:01:40] from the Scrolls and told me that that
[1:01:41] God was a great deliverer to his people
[1:01:43] and he would bless Israel and he was
[1:01:46] with Israel and all that circumcised in
[1:01:48] that Covenant and God's blessing is upon
[1:01:51] them and I'm one of them wow and he said
[1:01:54] I have a right so I'm going after that
[1:01:56] sheep and he grabbed his slingshot and
[1:01:58] brought the Sheep back by killing the
[1:02:00] line he was perseverant what was God
[1:02:02] doing God was training him who did God
[1:02:05] use he used a great man of God called
[1:02:08] Jesse who just told him Bible stories at
[1:02:10] night
[1:02:12] Jesse was not a theologian as far as I
[1:02:14] know he wasn't a prophet as far as I
[1:02:16] know he didn't do anything else that we
[1:02:18] know except tell stories to his kids at
[1:02:20] night you know what I think it'd be a
[1:02:22] great thing for you to have a little
[1:02:23] devotional or do it in the morning or do
[1:02:25] it at night do in the afternoon whatever
[1:02:27] but your your children will benefit from
[1:02:30] like David did because David never knew
[1:02:32] he was going to be a King David never
[1:02:34] knew what was going to be the outcome of
[1:02:36] his life Jesse never knew what was going
[1:02:38] to be the outcome of his family he never
[1:02:40] knew any of that at all but but this is
[1:02:42] what brother Branham it takes time to
[1:02:44] point out that this is what happened in
[1:02:47] their household and Jesse just kind of
[1:02:49] was perseverant in telling these stories
[1:02:51] and
[1:02:53] it was a blessing
[1:02:55] amen you say did it matter did to David
[1:02:57] yeah
[1:02:58] are we all right yeah can I go a little
[1:03:00] farther
[1:03:01] all right so brother Branham says now
[1:03:03] again an influence he says no matter
[1:03:04] what the rest of the world has got to do
[1:03:07] he says that has not got one thing to do
[1:03:09] with you or me we are responsible to God
[1:03:11] for our lives and for our expectation
[1:03:13] with Christ
[1:03:14] now so would it be all right if I took a
[1:03:17] question and expounded on it for you
[1:03:21] like maybe Jesse would have for David
[1:03:23] would that be all right
[1:03:24] and this is something that every young
[1:03:27] person needs to know if you're if you're
[1:03:29] young now your fathers need to uh listen
[1:03:31] to this and you all you young people
[1:03:33] need to listen to this because this is
[1:03:35] one question or one issue that you need
[1:03:38] to have settled if you're going to have
[1:03:39] confidence in your Christian Life
[1:03:41] uh and that is about the sin question
[1:03:44] you got to know that you're forgiven
[1:03:47] we know that Jesus died on the cross how
[1:03:49] many would agree that Jesus died on the
[1:03:51] cross for your sins we you we all know
[1:03:53] that historically the Bible tells us
[1:03:54] that and your pastors repeated that but
[1:03:56] you got to know you got to know
[1:03:58] personally and the best way for you to
[1:04:00] know is get it direct from God's word
[1:04:02] and then we don't have any doubt about
[1:04:04] it right
[1:04:05] so I'm not going to turn this into a
[1:04:07] child service here but I want to just
[1:04:09] demonstrate to you how clear certain
[1:04:11] things are in terms of this particular
[1:04:14] question and there's lots of other
[1:04:15] questions as well that you can research
[1:04:18] for your family and talk about and it'll
[1:04:20] influence your your children as they
[1:04:21] grow up okay would that be all right
[1:04:23] this is going to be a little bit
[1:04:25] different here but you'll you'll see as
[1:04:27] We Roll Along here so I found this
[1:04:29] statement by Oswald Chambers and uh I
[1:04:32] thought it was worth repeating here at
[1:04:33] the beginning of Life we do not
[1:04:35] reconcile ourselves to the fact of sin
[1:04:37] most of us don't even believe that we're
[1:04:39] born in sin right when we when we first
[1:04:41] come into the world we take a rational
[1:04:43] view of life and say to the Man by
[1:04:46] controlling his instincts and by
[1:04:48] educating himself can produce a life
[1:04:51] which will slowly evolve into the life
[1:04:54] of God
[1:04:56] that's really true
[1:04:57] a lot of us feel like we can do this I
[1:05:00] mean when you're before you're really
[1:05:01] converted a lot of us feel we can do
[1:05:03] this Christian bookstore is full of uh
[1:05:05] how to's right uh you know all kinds of
[1:05:09] remedies for problems and solutions for
[1:05:11] things lots of people today who don't
[1:05:14] really know anything about the New Birth
[1:05:16] they'll go in there and they'll pick a
[1:05:17] book that helps answer the question
[1:05:19] about the problem that they have and
[1:05:21] they figure over time if I follow these
[1:05:23] principles you know what it'll slowly
[1:05:24] evolve into a life of God but you know
[1:05:26] what that's not how it happens
[1:05:28] right that's not how it happens right
[1:05:30] and and it doesn't happen because of
[1:05:32] this problem of sin that he's talking
[1:05:33] about and then he says but as we go on
[1:05:35] we find the presence of something which
[1:05:37] we have not taken into consideration sin
[1:05:40] and it upsets our calculations
[1:05:43] because you know what it's it's a fallen
[1:05:45] nature right yeah it's a fallen nature
[1:05:48] it's not the nature of God and so
[1:05:51] therefore sin has made the basis of
[1:05:53] things wild and not rational it is not
[1:05:57] being reconciled to the fact of sin that
[1:06:00] produces all the disasters of life
[1:06:02] it'll eventually eventually Take You
[1:06:04] Down
[1:06:05] and because we're born in sin every one
[1:06:07] of us have got to deal with this every
[1:06:09] one of us have got to face the question
[1:06:10] like the Rich Young Ruler uh he had done
[1:06:12] lots of good things lived in a good way
[1:06:14] all of his life but he was nagged by
[1:06:16] that one question what happens when I
[1:06:18] die
[1:06:19] what happens when I die where will I go
[1:06:21] will I have eternal life will I live
[1:06:23] forever and he he could not uh he could
[1:06:26] not reconcile that he could do lots of
[1:06:28] good things he could be obedient and he
[1:06:29] could be successful in business and all
[1:06:31] the rest of it but he couldn't reconcile
[1:06:33] that question he knew Jesus had
[1:06:35] something he needed amen and so it upset
[1:06:39] his calculations if you like and he you
[1:06:41] know he was not reconciled to this
[1:06:43] question of sin and so us I thought
[1:06:45] Oswald chamber said it very very nicely
[1:06:47] so we have to deal with this question
[1:06:49] and you've got to settle it in your
[1:06:51] hearts and I trust today it will be
[1:06:53] settled in your hearts forever that we
[1:06:55] are forgiven and if you're forgiven you
[1:06:57] know what you have communion with God
[1:07:00] and when you have communion with God God
[1:07:02] has access to you and you have access to
[1:07:05] God Amen you remember in the Old
[1:07:07] Testament nobody came near the
[1:07:09] Tabernacle nobody came near the holy of
[1:07:11] holies unless they had blood there had
[1:07:13] to be a provision made in order to come
[1:07:15] near the presence of God isn't that
[1:07:16] right amen and so God Made A Way God
[1:07:19] made a way for it to be even uh more
[1:07:21] perfect than that because now uh Jesus
[1:07:23] said I'll not only be with you but I'll
[1:07:25] be in you until the end of the way and
[1:07:28] and he made that way it wasn't us who
[1:07:30] did that but you've got to come to the
[1:07:31] place where uh you know it's all right
[1:07:33] for brother Barry to say it's so
[1:07:34] confidently it's all right for my pastor
[1:07:36] and brother Brandon to saith but you
[1:07:37] know what you got to come to a
[1:07:39] realization that this question has
[1:07:40] settled for me and settled once and for
[1:07:43] all because without it you'll always be
[1:07:45] wondering and without it you'll always
[1:07:46] be doubting and you're wondering well
[1:07:48] you know is this really true and am I
[1:07:50] really forgiven and all the rest of it
[1:07:51] and it'll it'll cause your Christian
[1:07:53] walk to be questionable
[1:07:55] even if it's in your own mind now God
[1:07:59] has never promised to meet any man
[1:08:00] brother Branham said upon his merits how
[1:08:02] good he or she is right
[1:08:05] right yeah I mean it's a good thing that
[1:08:06] you're good but God never promised to
[1:08:08] meet you because you are good there's no
[1:08:11] fellowship with God upon your own Merit
[1:08:14] there's no seniority with God there's no
[1:08:17] listen there's no entitlement with God
[1:08:20] well I've been in the message all my
[1:08:21] life I cut my teeth in the back of a
[1:08:23] message Pew and now you know what I've
[1:08:24] never even said the word Trinity in my
[1:08:26] life so God you owe me this you know and
[1:08:29] hey I that's a dangerous little attitude
[1:08:32] to have because that you know what that
[1:08:34] does that pushes the boundaries out a
[1:08:35] little bit farther in your own mind so
[1:08:37] well let's go on he said the only place
[1:08:39] that there is fellowship is under the
[1:08:41] shed blood
[1:08:43] from Genesis to Revelation it's through
[1:08:45] the blood an innocent substitute died in
[1:08:48] order to cover the guilty the penitent
[1:08:49] sinner only the blood that's that's the
[1:08:51] only way that God agreed to meet with
[1:08:54] That's the basis from the Garden of Eden
[1:08:55] onward God agreed to meet with uh
[1:08:57] individuals so the scripture says uh in
[1:09:01] Psalm 103 that he had not dealt with us
[1:09:04] after our sins nor rewarded us according
[1:09:06] to our iniquities and all the forgiven
[1:09:08] said Thank You Jesus hey yeah you ought
[1:09:11] to be you ought to be reacting a little
[1:09:13] more than that I'm not I'm not rebuking
[1:09:15] you I'm just saying I'm awfully glad
[1:09:17] that God is Not has not dealt with me
[1:09:19] after my sins you don't know half my
[1:09:23] sins
[1:09:24] I'll tell you what I'm excited that
[1:09:26] God's not he's not dealing with me with
[1:09:28] me after after my iniquity and after my
[1:09:31] sin he does not deal with you on the
[1:09:33] basis of being good he doesn't deal with
[1:09:35] you on the basis of your iniquity
[1:09:38] glory to God he says for us Heaven is
[1:09:40] high above the Earth so great is his
[1:09:42] Mercy toward them that fear Him and as
[1:09:44] far as the East is from the West so far
[1:09:46] hathy removed our transgressions from
[1:09:49] amen I love it you ought to you ought to
[1:09:53] write these scriptures down like as a
[1:09:55] father pityth his children so the Lord
[1:09:57] pity at them that fear Him for he knows
[1:09:59] our frame and he remembers we are but
[1:10:01] dust he became one of us so he knows
[1:10:03] what it feels like he's been there done
[1:10:05] that got the scars to prove it let me
[1:10:07] tell you something we ought to we ought
[1:10:09] to rest in that verse alone that's a
[1:10:11] powerful verse and in Isaiah 53 the
[1:10:14] promise was he had to please the Lord to
[1:10:15] bruise him and he put him to grief why
[1:10:18] when thou shall make his soul an
[1:10:21] offering for sin it was not his sin but
[1:10:24] it was our sin that God made him an
[1:10:26] offering for
[1:10:27] are we clear on that Jesus lived he was
[1:10:31] sinless and he committed no sin uh he's
[1:10:33] the only one on earth who ever did that
[1:10:34] he was the only one that could lay down
[1:10:36] his life as a sinless offering here and
[1:10:39] he was made he was made an offering for
[1:10:42] sin and that sin is your sin you're the
[1:10:44] reason he had to go to the cross I tell
[1:10:47] people all the time candidates for
[1:10:48] baptism I tell them all the time that if
[1:10:50] Jesus never had to die for anyone he
[1:10:53] would have had to die for you you were
[1:10:55] the one that put him on the cross
[1:10:57] it wasn't just you but he would have had
[1:10:59] to go for you because you could not pay
[1:11:01] the penalty yourself and if you have
[1:11:04] eternal life God had to make a way for
[1:11:05] you to get into heaven and this is the
[1:11:07] way he did it he made Jesus Christ an
[1:11:09] offering for sin he made him a suffering
[1:11:11] savior on your behalf and it says he
[1:11:13] shall see his seed and prolong his days
[1:11:15] and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[1:11:17] prosper in his hand read down and he
[1:11:19] says and he shall see the travail of his
[1:11:21] soul and shall be satisfied by his
[1:11:23] knowledge shall my righteous servant
[1:11:25] justify many for he shall bear their
[1:11:29] iniquities God doesn't deal with you
[1:11:31] after your iniquity he took your
[1:11:34] iniquity and laid it upon him and he
[1:11:36] Bears your iniquity somebody say Amen
[1:11:39] hey that's good stuff
[1:11:41] in the Old Testament in the Old
[1:11:43] Testament the believer maybe committed
[1:11:46] adultery told a lie uh came with the
[1:11:48] lamb uh he's brother Ram said the first
[1:11:51] thing the lamb had to be perfect without
[1:11:52] a blemish for the sin offering and a lot
[1:11:54] of people think well if I could be a
[1:11:56] Christian if we'd just quit the if I
[1:11:58] just quit this and if I could just be a
[1:12:01] better person or a better woman I heard
[1:12:04] my father say that all of his life he
[1:12:05] was a smoker Drinker he was an alcoholic
[1:12:07] he was a Catholic and we would always
[1:12:09] witness to him you know we were young
[1:12:10] fellows wet behind the ears and we we
[1:12:13] witnessed everybody I mean we we told
[1:12:16] everybody about the gospel and we we try
[1:12:18] to convince a bunch of Jesuits one time
[1:12:20] and got in all kinds of trouble but we
[1:12:23] my father said this all the time he said
[1:12:25] well if I quit smoking he says then
[1:12:27] maybe I'll come into church and if I can
[1:12:28] quit drinking then I'll come into church
[1:12:30] and we always tried to tell him that uh
[1:12:32] if you could do it you wouldn't need the
[1:12:34] Holy Spirit right right yeah I I said
[1:12:37] you know surrender your life to Christ
[1:12:39] and watch what he does in your life
[1:12:41] I said because you know what he did in
[1:12:43] our lives
[1:12:44] because Dad used to tell people he said
[1:12:46] I remember uh you know when the message
[1:12:48] came and Outsiders and they were all
[1:12:51] Catholics all of our family were
[1:12:52] Catholics and we lived in the Catholic
[1:12:54] area and uh you know they'd ask him they
[1:12:57] say Frank what happened to your sons
[1:12:58] after all what what went on with them
[1:13:00] and dad knew dad knew what we were
[1:13:03] because he would come out Saturday night
[1:13:05] when we would be so drunk we'd fall on
[1:13:08] the ground and wouldn't be able to find
[1:13:09] the door so we couldn't get in the house
[1:13:11] and we'd be laying out on the on the
[1:13:13] lawn laying in a snowbank and dad would
[1:13:15] come out and pick us up and throw us in
[1:13:17] the bed
[1:13:17] and dad knew what kind of a life we
[1:13:19] lived and we were teenagers when when
[1:13:21] that went on
[1:13:22] and now dad looked around and saw his
[1:13:25] boys carrying their Bible who had got a
[1:13:28] haircut wow sitting Saturday night on
[1:13:30] the couch when we used to be out in the
[1:13:32] bar and now we're sitting on the couch
[1:13:33] having a Bible study or we're listening
[1:13:35] to brother Brandon on a tape and we'd be
[1:13:37] sitting there like this and Rewind it
[1:13:39] again we want to hear it again
[1:13:41] and he saw that difference in our lives
[1:13:43] and he knew and we said Dad if you could
[1:13:46] do it yourself you would need the holy
[1:13:47] spirit let let the Holy Spirit into your
[1:13:51] life and watch what he does in the
[1:13:53] cleansing power of the Holy Spirit and
[1:13:55] he always felt like he had to do that
[1:13:57] and brother random says you'd never be
[1:13:59] better in that estate in that way of
[1:14:01] thinking you'll never be better you can
[1:14:03] never get better until something comes
[1:14:05] in you to make you better and then
[1:14:07] you're born again you can't do it
[1:14:09] say it after me I can't do it I can't do
[1:14:13] it I never could still can't
[1:14:17] you can't do it something's got to come
[1:14:19] in and make you better something's got
[1:14:21] to be quick and inside you that makes
[1:14:23] you better something that's not to you
[1:14:25] has got to be at work in you to make you
[1:14:27] a real son or a daughter of God
[1:14:30] and let me tell you when you know it's
[1:14:32] not you doing it but it's some other
[1:14:33] higher power doing it you've got a piece
[1:14:36] that passes understanding and it comes
[1:14:37] with that amen now I'm a graphic person
[1:14:39] so let me draw it for you graphically no
[1:14:41] matter how good you are you could only
[1:14:43] rise as high as God's righteous
[1:14:45] requirements
[1:14:46] right sin doesn't enter into the
[1:14:49] presence of God and no matter how good
[1:14:50] we were we're still born in sin because
[1:14:52] of Romans 3 23 right
[1:14:55] right are you following me so no matter
[1:14:57] how good we were that's the height we
[1:14:58] could rise nothing else mattered nothing
[1:15:00] else would change that picture as it is
[1:15:02] written there's none righteous no not
[1:15:05] one
[1:15:06] say it after me not me
[1:15:08] not me none of us were none of us had
[1:15:11] the right to go up to God and say well
[1:15:13] how did I do I mean how about it
[1:15:16] amen don't tell me God doesn't have a
[1:15:19] sense of humor right he must really
[1:15:20] laugh at people who think that way
[1:15:22] there's none right just know not one
[1:15:24] and what brother Branham is telling us
[1:15:26] is that once the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:15:28] was shed you know what we could go right
[1:15:31] through that blood and keep going on and
[1:15:34] on and on into eternity and Revelation 5
[1:15:37] 9 is our is our testimony he sung a new
[1:15:40] song Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[1:15:41] and open the seals thereof for thou was
[1:15:44] slain and has redeemed us unto God by
[1:15:47] thy blood out of every Kindred tongue
[1:15:49] and people and Nation
[1:15:52] the only way you can Ascend higher the
[1:15:54] only way you can pass through God's
[1:15:56] righteous requirement is that Jesus
[1:15:58] stood
[1:15:59] in your place
[1:16:01] and said I'll pay the price let them
[1:16:02] pass let them go
[1:16:04] and there's no stopping and Satan of God
[1:16:06] once he gets past that uh that blue line
[1:16:08] once he gets passed there through the
[1:16:09] blood of Jesus Christ there's no
[1:16:11] stopping no stopping them hey there's no
[1:16:13] stopping us when we die when we die it's
[1:16:16] not the end of our Lives we keep going
[1:16:17] we go right on it's not death that holds
[1:16:20] us it's not sin that holds us it's not
[1:16:22] the world that holds us nothing holds
[1:16:25] the Bride of Jesus Christ back we Ascend
[1:16:27] and we keep going all the way into
[1:16:29] eternity glory to God
[1:16:31] that's that's the picture
[1:16:35] now brother manham says again he says
[1:16:37] now we're imperfect and everybody I need
[1:16:40] you all to say Amen here
[1:16:42] we're imperfect you know he's talking to
[1:16:45] he's talking to you buddy
[1:16:47] born in sin shape didn't come to the
[1:16:49] world speaking lies we're no good to
[1:16:51] begin with but God don't look at you he
[1:16:55] looks at the sacrifice he looks at the
[1:16:58] lamb
[1:16:59] he don't see you
[1:17:02] because he sees Christ Jesus died for
[1:17:06] you and now if you can find some Fault
[1:17:09] With Jesus then your healing might not
[1:17:12] be right but if you don't find no fault
[1:17:15] with him it's perfect
[1:17:18] don't be afraid I'm an heir to this and
[1:17:21] I know I don't deserve it but I'm an
[1:17:24] anyhow
[1:17:27] you're sitting there saying I don't
[1:17:29] deserve it I say you're exactly right
[1:17:30] that's the truest thing you've said all
[1:17:32] day you don't deserve it you you did
[1:17:35] nothing in your life to deserve God
[1:17:36] saying now there's a there's a great guy
[1:17:38] there's a great girl right there God let
[1:17:41] me tell you you did not do anything that
[1:17:43] God would point at you and say I'm going
[1:17:46] to save that guy you know he's not in
[1:17:47] the book but I'm going to say anyway
[1:17:48] because he's such a great guy he just
[1:17:50] does so many things right
[1:17:52] forget it
[1:17:55] forget it
[1:17:58] here's the way Paul and brother Branham
[1:18:00] both wrote it this is a faithful saying
[1:18:02] and worthy of all acceptation that
[1:18:04] Christ Jesus came into the world to save
[1:18:05] Sinners of whom I'm chief
[1:18:07] brother random said it in his way now as
[1:18:09] far as me myself as a man I am as you
[1:18:12] and worse than you
[1:18:15] that's what he said not me that's what
[1:18:17] he said I'm only saying what the tape
[1:18:19] say many of you all come with Christian
[1:18:21] backgrounds I'm the chiefest of Sinners
[1:18:24] the lowest of life that could be lived
[1:18:26] as an unbeliever and doubter I was
[1:18:29] but since a child have always known
[1:18:32] that there was a God and knew that
[1:18:34] there's something happened in my life
[1:18:36] and he said that's beyond any question
[1:18:39] at all
[1:18:40] brother Ram knew he had nothing to bring
[1:18:42] nothing in my hands I bring but simply
[1:18:44] to thy cross I cling
[1:18:46] and Paul had the same confession here
[1:18:48] because just because they're prophets
[1:18:50] and just because they're used of God and
[1:18:52] just because they say they'll say the
[1:18:53] Lord doesn't mean somehow that they have
[1:18:55] some exemption here they were Sinners
[1:18:57] just like us they came through the same
[1:18:59] blood that we came through they came
[1:19:00] through the same Act of repentance that
[1:19:02] we did had to received the same holy
[1:19:04] ghost that we have exactly the same and
[1:19:06] in every way the requirement of a new
[1:19:08] birth was the same for them as for us
[1:19:10] because we're all all
[1:19:12] there's no none righteous no not one
[1:19:15] [Music]
[1:19:16] and God made this possible but they're
[1:19:18] quick to acknowledge and they're quick
[1:19:20] to identify their own sinfulness and
[1:19:23] their own sinful past
[1:19:25] and Paul says you know the scripture
[1:19:27] here and I'm just going going quickly
[1:19:28] because you know the scripture he says
[1:19:30] but what things were gained to me those
[1:19:32] I counted lost for Christ and he says I
[1:19:34] count all things but lost for the
[1:19:35] Excellency of the knowledge of Christ
[1:19:37] Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered
[1:19:39] the loss of all things and to count them
[1:19:41] a dung that I may win Christ let me
[1:19:43] paraphrase just a little bit and say
[1:19:45] that the one word that helps us
[1:19:47] understand this verse is that Paul is
[1:19:49] acknowledging that compared to what I
[1:19:53] have now
[1:19:54] that
[1:19:56] he said is not even worth anything
[1:19:59] I thank God for you know heaven heaven
[1:20:02] brought me to where I am but compared to
[1:20:04] what I have now I'd never go back to
[1:20:05] that
[1:20:06] that's behind me I'd never go back to
[1:20:08] that absolutely not because now I know
[1:20:11] what I have now now he says I can be
[1:20:14] found in him not having mine own
[1:20:15] righteousness which is of the law but
[1:20:18] that which is through Christ Jesus the
[1:20:19] righteousness which is of god by faith
[1:20:21] and that I might attain unto the
[1:20:23] resurrection of the Dead everything the
[1:20:25] power to take me from the grave is now
[1:20:27] in me and the power to uh you know to to
[1:20:30] live for God is now in me it's not not
[1:20:32] me that lives but Christ that lives in
[1:20:34] me the power to forgive is now in me the
[1:20:37] power the power the anointing to love
[1:20:38] the anointing to teach the anointing to
[1:20:40] know the anointing to be a Son of God
[1:20:43] the anointing to face death and still
[1:20:45] preach that's all in me now and he said
[1:20:47] compared to what I had this is nothing
[1:20:49] he said I press on now towards the mark
[1:20:52] I was this but now I'm this and compared
[1:20:55] to this I mean nothing compares to this
[1:20:57] it's behind me wow wow and that's where
[1:21:00] the dung phrase comes in and he says I I
[1:21:02] you know he freely is telling his
[1:21:04] testimony about uh where he's come to I
[1:21:07] I love this and brother bam says now
[1:21:09] when I'm praying when I'm praying God
[1:21:11] don't see me
[1:21:14] he just hears my voice through the blood
[1:21:16] of Jesus Christ
[1:21:18] think about this now next time you get
[1:21:21] down to pray when you're praying God
[1:21:22] doesn't see you but when you speak to
[1:21:24] him he hears your voice through the
[1:21:26] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:21:30] he don't see me he hears my voice
[1:21:34] and that blood there is to represent
[1:21:36] what I ask then he hears my voice but he
[1:21:39] sees only the blood
[1:21:42] he don't
[1:21:44] see me
[1:21:46] so I can't be dirty
[1:21:49] when I'm under the blood
[1:21:52] the blood cleanses
[1:21:54] [Music]
[1:21:57] he don't see me
[1:21:59] I can't be dirty when I'm under the
[1:22:01] blood
[1:22:03] you go through a week in this world on
[1:22:05] your job dealing with people out there
[1:22:07] and you know listening to the language
[1:22:09] and seeing what's going on on the
[1:22:11] internet and you're just you know you're
[1:22:13] just plowing through life and going
[1:22:14] through the week and I mean if you're in
[1:22:16] a college how many of you people are in
[1:22:18] college any kind of college or high
[1:22:20] school I got any high schoolers any

[1:22:32] you young man
[1:22:33] uh I mean you you go through school and
[1:22:36] you got to listen to what your cohorts
[1:22:37] tell you and they're trying to pull you
[1:22:39] to do this and making fun of you because
[1:22:40] they don't and uh you know they they
[1:22:43] make fun of girls and all the rest of it
[1:22:44] and and you know the the stuff that goes
[1:22:46] on in schools and the stuff that goes on
[1:22:48] in universities and the stuff that goes
[1:22:51] on in your job uh you know one of my
[1:22:53] sons worked at a bank and he said it
[1:22:54] wasn't like a week before he got there
[1:22:56] and all of a sudden they're talking
[1:22:57] about the next rainbow event and they
[1:22:59] want them to wear a rainbow tie
[1:23:02] we want you to wear a rainbow tie to
[1:23:04] work you know I'm just working in a bank

[1:23:14] because you're you're being
[1:23:15] discriminatory and it doesn't matter
[1:23:17] about your rights it matters about their
[1:23:18] rights your rights don't really count
[1:23:20] don't talk about your rights here
[1:23:22] because you're a Christian and they
[1:23:23] don't have rights so don't worry about
[1:23:24] that
[1:23:26] and and everywhere you go you rub
[1:23:28] shoulders with dirt and nonsense and
[1:23:30] filth and everything else and you can
[1:23:32] come to church here this morning dress
[1:23:33] nice but you may feel in your spirit
[1:23:36] you're dirty because you've mixed with a
[1:23:38] dirty world all week
[1:23:40] you I mean you may have not done
[1:23:42] anything wrong you may not cross any
[1:23:44] lines but you feel like uh you feel like
[1:23:46] uh you know you just feel like uh mop
[1:23:49] water at the end of a week because
[1:23:52] you've just been around it so much and
[1:23:55] listen to the language and listen to the
[1:23:57] old humor and all this all the other
[1:23:59] stuff that goes on there and and you can
[1:24:01] feel that way you may not be but you can
[1:24:03] feel that way and sometimes that can be
[1:24:06] even defeating in your own mind because
[1:24:08] you feel like man I probably shouldn't
[1:24:10] even go to church or I probably
[1:24:12] shouldn't even take foot washing and
[1:24:13] communion you know what because I mean I
[1:24:15] just you know I just feel like man just
[1:24:17] such a rascal out there in the in the
[1:24:19] world it may not have done anything but
[1:24:21] you feel that way right amen and then
[1:24:23] sometimes you wonder well what's the
[1:24:25] point and but let me tell you something
[1:24:27] I'm here to tell you this morning the
[1:24:28] good news is is that he don't see me
[1:24:31] when I pray and I can't be dirty when
[1:24:33] I'm under the blood because when he
[1:24:35] looks at me he only sees the blood
[1:24:39] Hallelujah and you need to stop looking
[1:24:43] at you like you look at you you need to
[1:24:45] be looking at yourself like God looks at
[1:24:47] you and I'm telling you this morning
[1:24:49] exactly how God sees you and that is he
[1:24:52] doesn't see you he sees the blood
[1:24:55] and if he sees the blood of his own son
[1:24:59] you know what I'll go to church
[1:25:02] I'll go to church
[1:25:05] I'm going to put my trust in this hello
[1:25:07] that's what you're supposed to do
[1:25:08] [Applause]
[1:25:10] I didn't come all the way down here to
[1:25:12] tell you stories
[1:25:14] I try to keep false Doctrine to a
[1:25:16] minimum when I travel
[1:25:18] huh
[1:25:21] I mean it's either true or it's not amen
[1:25:24] there's nothing in between this right
[1:25:27] he doesn't have seal
[1:25:29] there's nothing in between here this is
[1:25:31] either true or it's not true I believe
[1:25:33] it's true
[1:25:35] do you believe it's true if that's true
[1:25:38] the sin question is settled you know
[1:25:39] what it's all under the blood
[1:25:41] [Applause]
[1:25:42] can I go a little further
[1:25:46] today God's made a contact contract not
[1:25:49] because you were good because you joined
[1:25:51] Church you could be ever so good and
[1:25:53] live a clean life I'm being repetitive
[1:25:54] here and give part of your money uh give
[1:25:56] up all the sins of the world like lent
[1:25:58] and uh to live just as true and faithful
[1:26:01] as you can he said you'll miss Heaven
[1:26:03] just as far as East is from the West
[1:26:05] if you're if you're trying to approach
[1:26:06] the Gates of Heaven on the basis of this
[1:26:08] forget it
[1:26:09] it isn't by goodness that we are saved
[1:26:13] but it's by his Mercy say it with me his
[1:26:17] Mercy now I'll say it all together now
[1:26:19] his Mercy most congregations are not
[1:26:22] good at this but it's by my congregation
[1:26:24] I got to go three times every time I got
[1:26:26] to go three rounds before they get it
[1:26:27] right
[1:26:28] it takes up a lot of time but it's by
[1:26:31] his Mercy that we're bought
[1:26:33] it's by his Mercy that we're bought he
[1:26:36] paid the price
[1:26:38] you remember back in the Old Testament
[1:26:40] when I think it was Jeremiah wanted to
[1:26:42] buy the field and the man said hey
[1:26:43] inhabit he said no I want to buy it I
[1:26:45] want to make sure that there's an
[1:26:46] exchange here yeah yeah I want to make
[1:26:48] sure there's something given for this
[1:26:49] and I I'm not going to take it for free
[1:26:51] I thank you but I'm not going to take it
[1:26:53] for free because uh you may not
[1:26:54] understand it but this is a type of what
[1:26:56] God's going to do later on he's going to
[1:26:58] pay a price for people here and he just
[1:27:00] doesn't want it for free and give them
[1:27:01] to him here because then Satan would
[1:27:02] always have an advantage so if you don't
[1:27:04] mind I'm going to pay the price and I'm
[1:27:06] going to pay the full price
[1:27:08] I'm going to pay everything so nobody
[1:27:09] can come back and say you didn't pay
[1:27:12] Jesus did pay
[1:27:14] [Applause]
[1:27:15] and it isn't by goodness I would say but
[1:27:17] it's by his Mercy that we're bought and
[1:27:20] God that God wanted to make Sons and
[1:27:22] Daughters of God
[1:27:24] Hallelujah like brother Jason said last
[1:27:26] night that brother Lonnie said that God
[1:27:27] never wanted to have a family he became
[1:27:29] a family but that family was still lost
[1:27:32] in sin so we had to settle a sin
[1:27:34] question in order for them to come back
[1:27:36] in fellowship with god with Father God
[1:27:39] when Jesus was here on Earth he made a
[1:27:41] sacrifice for healing and salvation
[1:27:43] Jesus could not come tonight and save
[1:27:46] you
[1:27:47] he's already done it
[1:27:50] right a sin question
[1:27:52] was settled
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:27:55] same question was settle where Calvary
[1:27:59] how long was it settled forever
[1:28:03] would you agree the sin question is
[1:28:05] settled in the eyes of God the sin
[1:28:06] question
[1:28:08] would you agree it's settled in God's
[1:28:09] mind this is not a question it's not not
[1:28:12] a doubt and God's not wondering
[1:28:14] it's settled price for sin has been paid
[1:28:17] he is the Lamb of God that took away the
[1:28:19] sins of the world it's past tense when a
[1:28:21] prophet tells you it's past tense Let it
[1:28:23] go Let it go I say this if it's good
[1:28:25] enough for God good enough for me I'm
[1:28:27] not going to argue that if God accepts
[1:28:29] that's fine great no matter how much you
[1:28:32] would scream out it wouldn't do you a
[1:28:34] bit of good he's a high priest sitting
[1:28:36] at the right hand of the Majesty of God
[1:28:37] he said you've got to accept it and
[1:28:39] profess it
[1:28:41] amen you've got to accept it and profess
[1:28:44] it
[1:28:46] same way for healing same way anything
[1:28:48] God provides for you you've got to
[1:28:50] accept it
[1:28:51] you might sit there and say well you
[1:28:53] know I believe brother Brandon had it I
[1:28:54] believe brother Barry's got it he's all
[1:28:55] red in the face I believe he's got it I
[1:28:57] believe Jason's got it here he's making
[1:28:58] notes
[1:29:01] that really is not going to do you any
[1:29:03] good until you sit there and say you
[1:29:05] know what
[1:29:06] I believe that
[1:29:07] you young people got to sit there and
[1:29:10] embrace this as truth and say you know
[1:29:13] what even if everyone walked out of here
[1:29:15] and said brother Barry's a false teacher
[1:29:17] I still believe it
[1:29:20] it's got to be that clear it's got to be
[1:29:21] that solid for you and then and only
[1:29:24] then this is incredible sin question
[1:29:25] settled for you it's already settled for
[1:29:27] God it's got to be settled for you
[1:29:29] oh listen all I'm doing is being a Jesse
[1:29:31] all right and all I'm doing is just
[1:29:32] giving you a Bible story before we quit
[1:29:34] all right I got this question from
[1:29:35] somebody and this was a sister and uh
[1:29:39] she she was actually uh well you'll read
[1:29:42] the the question and figure it out but
[1:29:44] she's not sure
[1:29:45] all right the question was two screens
[1:29:47] long stay with me so when I came to the
[1:29:49] message she said people told me that the
[1:29:51] Holy Ghost was not in me before the
[1:29:52] message
[1:29:53] that it was just an anointing and that
[1:29:56] anointing can be even on and bless
[1:29:58] unbelievers because the rain falls on
[1:30:00] the just in the unjust
[1:30:02] so here she is now she comes in on a
[1:30:03] message and everybody says well it all
[1:30:05] begins right there and you were not
[1:30:07] saved or you're not under the blood
[1:30:08] before the message
[1:30:12] or that I wasn't even covered by the
[1:30:14] blood of Jesus Christ during those years
[1:30:15] and it really makes you wonder how to
[1:30:17] know
[1:30:19] when your peace is true peace and how to
[1:30:22] know when your salvation experience is
[1:30:24] real
[1:30:25] and how to know when you're truly
[1:30:27] following God this is a great question
[1:30:30] that's the first part here's the second
[1:30:32] part
[1:30:33] because from that moment in 1986 I had
[1:30:36] peace that passes understanding when she
[1:30:39] came in contact with God she said I had
[1:30:41] peace that passes understanding I had
[1:30:43] joy unspeakable and full of Glory I knew
[1:30:46] I had a relationship with the Creator I
[1:30:48] knew thank you
[1:30:51] I knew that I had a relationship with
[1:30:53] the Creator
[1:30:54] I it would be like finding out right now
[1:30:57] that there was yet another prophet and
[1:30:58] you really weren't under the word for
[1:30:59] your day and all this time you weren't
[1:31:01] covered by the blood
[1:31:03] yet you have had all the right
[1:31:04] relationships and experience and life
[1:31:07] that the Bible speaks about
[1:31:09] so here's the question so were my past
[1:31:12] experiences true experiences with God
[1:31:14] good question yes yes you'd have to
[1:31:17] agree that was a good question amen and
[1:31:19] I I I I communicated with this person
[1:31:21] and I I wanted to let brother Branham
[1:31:24] answer her okay and I I because I found
[1:31:26] some statements that uh would really
[1:31:28] help her okay and so follow me now I'm
[1:31:30] going to answer her question all right
[1:31:31] so it's not going to take a long time
[1:31:33] but watch what watch what brother
[1:31:34] Brandon says in 1957 and I gave her a
[1:31:37] bunch of scriptures and uh you know gave
[1:31:39] her some commentary and so forth but
[1:31:40] what's really what's really valuable for
[1:31:43] us to be able to give to somebody is not
[1:31:44] what I think
[1:31:46] right yeah right right that's that's all
[1:31:49] right but that's really not as good as
[1:31:51] When God says because in God's mind this
[1:31:53] is already a subtle thing right and and
[1:31:56] so therefore let God tell her let God
[1:31:58] convince her so I gave her the word and
[1:32:00] and I prayed with her that the Holy
[1:32:02] Spirit would convince her of how God
[1:32:03] views this whole question that she's
[1:32:05] asked which is a great question and
[1:32:07] brother Brown says by one Spirit we're
[1:32:09] all baptized into the body he said that
[1:32:11] isn't when the new birth begins
[1:32:13] the new birth begins when you believe on
[1:32:16] the Lord Jesus foreign
[1:32:19] that's right
[1:32:20] now notice what he doesn't say I hope
[1:32:22] this is all right good but he said the
[1:32:25] new birth begins when you walk in a
[1:32:27] message Church
[1:32:29] he doesn't say that
[1:32:30] amen amen
[1:32:34] the new birth doesn't begin when you
[1:32:36] come in contact with self-righteous
[1:32:37] message believers
[1:32:39] who believe it's just us for no more and
[1:32:41] you have to come to Bethel Tabernacle or
[1:32:43] you're not really in a message
[1:32:46] um
[1:32:47] God forbid we have that attitude God
[1:32:50] forbid yeah
[1:32:51] now listen he says what can you do
[1:32:54] besides believe in other words can I
[1:32:56] mean would bleeding help
[1:32:58] would shouting help we've already proved
[1:33:00] it wouldn't would giving your body to be
[1:33:02] burned would that help no
[1:33:05] I mean if I understand it right based on
[1:33:07] what I've already told you the work's
[1:33:09] already been done yeah
[1:33:10] yeah right if Jesus stood here tonight
[1:33:12] he couldn't forgive you because he's
[1:33:13] already done it
[1:33:15] now listen what can you do besides
[1:33:17] believe what more can you do now let me
[1:33:19] stop again and say it's not just an
[1:33:21] intellectual exercise where you just say
[1:33:23] uh do I believe yes or no check one box
[1:33:25] and don't check both right it's not an
[1:33:28] intellectual exercise you know what it
[1:33:30] is it really is a an encounter with God
[1:33:33] an encounter with the Living God and
[1:33:35] that's not a passive thing that's a real
[1:33:37] thing
[1:33:39] you should be able to tell your
[1:33:40] testimony it might not be dramatic it
[1:33:43] might not be you know lightning and
[1:33:44] thunder going off but I will tell you
[1:33:46] something when a person meets God they
[1:33:48] know they've met God
[1:33:50] they know they've met God
[1:33:53] what can you do about it any more than
[1:33:55] just believe it he said tell me one
[1:33:57] thing that you could do there's not one
[1:33:59] thing that you can do outside of believe
[1:34:00] it God's already settled the the in
[1:34:03] other words there's nothing in your your
[1:34:04] power that can make you more saved than
[1:34:06] what Jesus has already done you can't be
[1:34:08] more forgiven than what God's already
[1:34:10] forgiven you you can't be more more
[1:34:11] righteous than what God's already made
[1:34:13] you he's already made you accepted in
[1:34:15] the Beloved you know what and you can't
[1:34:17] make yourself more acceptable then God
[1:34:18] can make you acceptable amen does that
[1:34:20] make sense and that that's what he's
[1:34:22] saying here so don't try to improve on
[1:34:24] God
[1:34:24] just let God's word be true and accept
[1:34:27] that and believe that that's what he's
[1:34:28] trying to get her to understand now then
[1:34:30] brother man tells a story about the car
[1:34:32] salesman you remember that and and it's
[1:34:34] a hot day it's back in the 50s or so and
[1:34:38] uh this car salesman he's got a jacket
[1:34:41] and a really fancy tie and he go he puts
[1:34:43] on the jacket because it there's a
[1:34:45] couple of women that are out there I put
[1:34:46] on my coat to go out and some ladies
[1:34:48] were out there and on the road back I
[1:34:49] hung up my coat when I did I said I
[1:34:51] wonder if I gave them the keys and I
[1:34:54] reached in my pocket and I pulled out a
[1:34:56] little piece of paper and had written on
[1:34:58] it where will you spend eternity
[1:35:01] and he didn't know where that came from
[1:35:03] he's looking for keys and he finds this
[1:35:05] little piece of paper will you spend
[1:35:07] eternity and he said I laid it down and
[1:35:09] I said turn the fans on and I picked it
[1:35:11] back up again and he said I couldn't get
[1:35:13] away from it where will you spend
[1:35:15] eternity he's not in church uh he
[1:35:17] doesn't know anything about brother
[1:35:18] Branham he he's he's just all of a
[1:35:20] sudden he's encountered a question that
[1:35:23] he doesn't have an answer for I got to
[1:35:24] reckon with this I got to deal with this
[1:35:26] this question here
[1:35:27] and then he tells the story uh pause for
[1:35:31] a second don't read that
[1:35:32] uh look he says this is my sermon here
[1:35:35] so you
[1:35:37] he said in his story he said I went to
[1:35:40] the uh Methodist people and they told me
[1:35:43] oh no problem you got to come to the
[1:35:44] Altar and you got to pray and be
[1:35:45] Sanctified and he said I did that and I
[1:35:47] didn't answer the question and he said
[1:35:49] then I went to the Pentecostals and they
[1:35:50] said you got to speak in tongues and I
[1:35:51] did and he said it still didn't answer
[1:35:53] the question he said then I got a I went
[1:35:55] to a Billy Graham meeting he said I went
[1:35:57] to a meeting with Oral Roberts and Oral
[1:35:58] Roberts did this and so forth and he
[1:36:00] said at the end of it he said I was
[1:36:02] still kind of questioning and wondering
[1:36:04] well you know where will I spend
[1:36:05] eternity you didn't have an answer
[1:36:09] brother Branham talks to him and says
[1:36:12] and he and and the the this this part is
[1:36:15] when he's telling brother Branham
[1:36:16] because he met somebody and somebody
[1:36:18] said you need to go down and talk to
[1:36:19] Bill Branham down here down the road and
[1:36:21] he finds a brother Brandon he talks to
[1:36:23] him he says you don't need a prophet to
[1:36:25] straighten you out you just need the
[1:36:27] word of God yes
[1:36:29] now remember now I'm answering the
[1:36:31] question that this girl asked me okay
[1:36:33] and she's wondering is she really saved
[1:36:36] when was she saved and so forth and
[1:36:38] brother Branham says now what the
[1:36:39] Pentecostals and yet he said what's
[1:36:42] Pentecostals and the nazarenes and so
[1:36:44] forth what Mr Graham told you is truth
[1:36:45] the nazarenes what the Pentecostals and
[1:36:48] yet it's not the truth
[1:36:51] he said to shout raise your hand speak
[1:36:53] with tongues is not receiving Christ
[1:36:55] receiving Christ is receiving the person
[1:36:58] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:00] it's a meeting with God
[1:37:02] it's a new birth right he said then
[1:37:05] these other things take place after that
[1:37:08] yeah
[1:37:09] yeah now could you do all those things
[1:37:11] still didn't have Christ yet and and so
[1:37:14] he's saying that you know there's a
[1:37:15] there's a beginning there's a meeting
[1:37:17] with God and he said there's an
[1:37:18] encounter that you have and he said all
[1:37:20] these other things take place they're
[1:37:21] not wrong
[1:37:22] they're not wrong but speaking in
[1:37:24] tongues doesn't save you right
[1:37:27] right right if if it did my goodness and
[1:37:30] every Pentecostal would be saved right
[1:37:34] well brother Branham where can I find
[1:37:36] him I said I want to ask you something
[1:37:37] let's go back to your story that day
[1:37:40] when you came in and picked up that
[1:37:41] piece of paper and something struck you
[1:37:44] and said I want to see God up to that
[1:37:47] time you were going this way or down the
[1:37:49] road and then you turned this way what
[1:37:53] did it
[1:37:55] well that's what repentance is isn't it
[1:37:57] repentance is you're going this way in
[1:37:59] life and now you do a 180 and you're
[1:38:01] going this way in life
[1:38:03] you know in other words he's already
[1:38:04] fulfilling scripture and doesn't even
[1:38:06] realize it he's actually walking in the
[1:38:08] word and obeying the word and doesn't
[1:38:10] even realize it because people have
[1:38:12] diverted him into believing well I got
[1:38:14] to do this I got to be here I got to
[1:38:15] speak in tongues all the other things
[1:38:16] that are there and brother man I'm
[1:38:17] saying now all of a sudden he said
[1:38:19] you're going this way now you're going
[1:38:20] that way and he says what changed your
[1:38:22] opinion what came into your heart that
[1:38:24] made you one time not care for God and
[1:38:27] something came in now to make you go to
[1:38:29] loving God right and he said well I
[1:38:31] don't know and I said before there could
[1:38:33] be a creation there's got to be a
[1:38:34] Creator he said God came into your heart
[1:38:37] right there when you looked at that
[1:38:40] piece of paper
[1:38:43] I'm only saying what the tape say yeah
[1:38:47] he said you mean I've had it all along
[1:38:49] and I said certainly brother and he
[1:38:52] jumped up he began to scream and cry
[1:38:54] that was settled for him you know why
[1:38:56] because he's got the word on it now
[1:38:59] and he said well do you want to pray for
[1:39:01] me and I said what's the use of praying
[1:39:02] for you you don't need any prayer the
[1:39:04] truth has set you free
[1:39:08] good answer brother random good answer
[1:39:11] haha
[1:39:13] amen God knows exactly what he's doing
[1:39:15] God knows how to reach the elect God
[1:39:17] knew how to find you God knew how to
[1:39:19] attract you God knew how to divert you
[1:39:21] and and he put the right thing in your
[1:39:23] pocket he put the right person in front
[1:39:24] of you he let you hear the right sermon
[1:39:26] or whatever whether you're raising a
[1:39:28] message or whether you come from the
[1:39:29] gutters of sin let me tell you God knew
[1:39:31] exactly how to knock on your door and
[1:39:33] get your attention so that you could not
[1:39:35] leave that until that question was
[1:39:37] settled and God has a variety of ways of
[1:39:40] doing it I thank God for the word that
[1:39:42] tells us this is already settled in the
[1:39:44] eyes of God let it be settled in our
[1:39:46] hearts now that he has forgiven us yeah
[1:39:50] and if we walk in the light as he's in
[1:39:52] the light we have Fellowship one with
[1:39:54] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:39:56] his son cleanses us from all sin amen
[1:40:00] glory to God he died Jesus died that he
[1:40:03] might breed back Hallelujah only the
[1:40:05] blood can do that only through the
[1:40:07] chemistry of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:40:08] can bring back again a person that won't
[1:40:12] vary one word from what God Said
[1:40:16] how do I know I got it I got it because
[1:40:18] I I there's something in me that just
[1:40:20] can't vary from the word of God
[1:40:22] he said but I can't forgive well just
[1:40:25] give it enough time let God work on you
[1:40:28] you can't force Somebody to Love and can
[1:40:30] somebody Force somebody to respect and
[1:40:32] you can't force somebody to forgive
[1:40:33] right that's got to come from within
[1:40:35] right got to come from the heart
[1:40:38] you can't force your children to obey
[1:40:39] they might comply
[1:40:41] but you you can't force them to love
[1:40:46] and Jesus said this he said if you love
[1:40:48] me you'd keep my Commandments
[1:40:50] [Music]
[1:40:52] so this is not dictated let me tell you
[1:40:55] the bride of Christ we don't we don't
[1:40:57] operate by legislation
[1:40:59] we operate by revelation
[1:41:02] and I got a revelation that I'm set free
[1:41:04] I got a revelation that what I
[1:41:08] what I was I'm not now by the grace of
[1:41:10] God and that was not that was not
[1:41:12] possible I mean I in my own testimony
[1:41:15] and if you've ever heard it the story
[1:41:16] Bound for Glory and uh I was uh I have I
[1:41:19] have what they refer to as an addictive
[1:41:21] personality and just my way and as my
[1:41:24] father had it and I have it and uh uh
[1:41:27] it's a funny thing but I when I was in
[1:41:29] the world and I was uh out there a young
[1:41:31] fella I started smoking when I was 11.
[1:41:34] and uh it just it just kind of hooked in
[1:41:37] there caught me and uh I for a while I'd
[1:41:40] give it up because it didn't feel good
[1:41:42] it made me feel bad and I was a
[1:41:44] lifeguard I was a swimmer and if you're
[1:41:45] a swimmer and you're trying to hold your
[1:41:47] breath underwater smoking's not a good
[1:41:48] thing ain't a good thing at all and uh
[1:41:51] because it shrinks the elasticity in
[1:41:53] your lungs and so forth and all the
[1:41:54] other stuff so I tried to give it up and
[1:41:56] I give it up and I found out I couldn't
[1:41:57] give it up I'd steal cigarettes from my
[1:41:59] father uh my father called me a low down
[1:42:02] dirty rat one time because I stole these
[1:42:04] cigarettes and I I would I would take
[1:42:07] cigarette butts that I'd find on the
[1:42:09] street and straighten them out and clean
[1:42:11] them up a little bit and smoke them I I
[1:42:14] collect them and I I I couldn't give
[1:42:17] them up it had a power over me I mean I
[1:42:19] was it was something that was I realized
[1:42:22] after a while was was stronger than me
[1:42:24] and uh when I uh when God got a hold of
[1:42:28] my heart I was still smoking when when
[1:42:30] God got a hold of my heart first time
[1:42:32] and I went and got baptized when I had
[1:42:36] my experience with God and when got
[1:42:38] baptized and it was middle of winter so
[1:42:39] I had my big parka on and I I came back
[1:42:42] from the town where I went to to get
[1:42:44] baptized and I was now just you know you
[1:42:48] just have a different walk in have a
[1:42:49] different song you have a different
[1:42:51] story you know after your yes surrender
[1:42:53] your life to Christ and I was walking
[1:42:55] down to downtown Street you know one of
[1:42:57] them I'm one of them so we only knew a
[1:43:00] couple of songs because we were
[1:43:01] Catholics you know and
[1:43:03] we we only knew Amazing Grace because we
[1:43:05] heard Willie Nelson sing it so you know
[1:43:07] we didn't really know a whole lot but I
[1:43:09] was thinking one of them going down the
[1:43:10] street and when I uh when I was going
[1:43:12] down so cold I put my hands in the
[1:43:14] pocket of my parka and bang
[1:43:17] I felt something I knew exactly what
[1:43:19] that was a box of cigarettes
[1:43:23] and immediately immediately I was so
[1:43:26] ashamed that I still carried cigarettes
[1:43:30] and I I just looked around to see if
[1:43:32] anybody I knew was around
[1:43:35] and there was nobody around so I just
[1:43:36] went like this and I went over found the
[1:43:38] nearest garbage can just threw them in
[1:43:39] the garbage can and went on
[1:43:41] and got rid of them because I was so
[1:43:43] ashamed that I was actually carrying
[1:43:44] them in my pocket after I was you know
[1:43:47] baptized and saved and and I I was just
[1:43:50] I was just so struck by that and then
[1:43:52] afterwards this struck me
[1:43:54] that I didn't take that away from me
[1:43:58] I didn't I didn't quit
[1:44:01] he took the desire out of that for me
[1:44:06] and I didn't have to try at all I didn't
[1:44:10] have to put any effort into it at all he
[1:44:13] took that desire from me and now I could
[1:44:15] be in a room waist high full of
[1:44:17] cigarettes wouldn't wouldn't affect me
[1:44:19] because I have no desire for it it's
[1:44:21] gone it's completely gone and he who in
[1:44:23] the sun sets free is free indeed and I
[1:44:26] believe I believe it was one of those
[1:44:27] little incidents that God allowed me to
[1:44:29] experience to prove this is not about
[1:44:31] you but this is me in you and the only
[1:44:34] way you're over going to come is me and
[1:44:36] you not you you're I'm not going to give
[1:44:37] you the tools and you go do it it's
[1:44:39] going to be me and you expressing The
[1:44:41] Life of Christ it's going to be me and
[1:44:43] you overcoming it's going to be me and
[1:44:45] you loving the unlovable it's me and you
[1:44:47] forgiving those people that you don't
[1:44:48] want to forgive it's not going to be you
[1:44:50] it's not going to be Berry coffee
[1:44:51] holding out his chest because if it was
[1:44:53] then you'd have a right to go up to
[1:44:55] heaven and say well how about now but
[1:44:57] when we go in there we'll all sing the
[1:44:59] same song of Amazing Grace how sweet the
[1:45:02] sound that saved a Wretch like Me I I
[1:45:06] once was lost but now I'm saved only the
[1:45:09] blood of Christ can breed a person back
[1:45:12] to a position where they don't vary from
[1:45:13] the word of God
[1:45:15] oh my goodness I tell you what I just
[1:45:18] love it here I we we could we could go
[1:45:21] on and there's all kinds of things here
[1:45:22] that we could include uh and and I I
[1:45:25] just you you have that you're going to
[1:45:27] have the PowerPoint so you can have it
[1:45:28] all if you're a fast reader you're good
[1:45:30] hey brother now watch watch this
[1:45:35] he said I I'd invite each one of you he
[1:45:38] said to come here at the altar and kneel
[1:45:40] down say Lord Jesus be merciful I want
[1:45:42] you to come into my heart
[1:45:44] he said God bless you brother and he
[1:45:46] said this man's name is Davis
[1:45:48] and he comes from Virginia
[1:45:50] and he's up here to give up a habit of
[1:45:52] smoking
[1:45:53] and a little Grudge that he's held in
[1:45:56] his heart against a loved one
[1:45:58] since he was a child
[1:46:02] and that's what he's at the altar for
[1:46:04] this morning
[1:46:06] God cares about the little things he's
[1:46:08] got a problem with smoking and he's got
[1:46:10] this little Grudge that he's alone to
[1:46:12] hear just enough to keep the Holy Spirit
[1:46:14] at Bay
[1:46:15] and you know what he's got to let go of
[1:46:17] that he's just got to let go and say
[1:46:19] Lord I'm going to forgive that person
[1:46:22] and I gotta Just Surrender it to you
[1:46:25] and here's God here's God through a
[1:46:27] prophet God's busy he's got he's got
[1:46:30] worlds to run he's got you know
[1:46:31] everything to to operate in the world
[1:46:33] here and and yet he's he's dealing with
[1:46:36] a prophet on this platform and this you
[1:46:39] know this man from Virginia is just
[1:46:40] kneeling at the altar and he's taking
[1:46:42] the time to tell this little Grudge
[1:46:44] matters
[1:46:46] and this little problem with smoking
[1:46:48] that he has it matters
[1:46:50] and you know what
[1:46:52] there's something in here for this guy
[1:46:53] to do he's just got to let that go and
[1:46:56] and what he can't accomplish in life you
[1:46:58] watch How I take that over and I'll deal
[1:47:01] with that but he's come to the right
[1:47:03] place and he's come to the altar in
[1:47:05] order to give that to God and sometimes
[1:47:06] that's just what you got to do
[1:47:08] yeah you gotta say Lord I can't deal
[1:47:09] with this anymore I can't overcome this
[1:47:11] myself I got to give it to somebody
[1:47:14] and that's all he wants you to say it's
[1:47:15] all he wants you to do
[1:47:20] because he had he always has a remedy he
[1:47:23] always has a solution
[1:47:26] let me tell you to me I hope if nothing
[1:47:28] else I've proven to you this morning
[1:47:30] that the sin question is settled in the
[1:47:32] eyes of God Amen that's that's a done
[1:47:34] deal
[1:47:35] I hope for you as an individual young or
[1:47:38] old that you realize the sin question
[1:47:40] also should be settled for you
[1:47:42] and if you can if you can understand if
[1:47:44] you can have a revelation of that fact
[1:47:46] that the sin question is settled
[1:47:48] and what I did my sinfulness is gone
[1:47:50] it's buried in the sea of God's
[1:47:52] forgetfulness
[1:47:53] and you know what you can have
[1:47:54] confidence as you leave here
[1:47:56] and whatever mistake I make I can bring
[1:47:58] to God and repent true repentance amen
[1:48:00] amen give it to him and I believe that
[1:48:02] the blood of Jesus Christ still atones
[1:48:03] today the same as it ever did I believe
[1:48:06] it's still as powerful today as it ever
[1:48:07] was
[1:48:10] but you know what no one's going to come
[1:48:12] and and uh impose that upon you you like
[1:48:15] brother van says you have to believe
[1:48:17] what God's provided you had to believe
[1:48:18] what God's given
[1:48:21] right now all I've been to you this
[1:48:23] morning is the father
[1:48:24] I wanted to be like Jesse just to take a
[1:48:27] subject work it through
[1:48:30] and and to me to me in raising our boys
[1:48:34] one of the things that I I felt like
[1:48:36] they needed to really have down pat was
[1:48:38] this whole idea of forgiveness and in
[1:48:40] the Sin question whether it's
[1:48:42] predestination or whether it's
[1:48:43] sanctification or whether it's you know
[1:48:45] do I need to go to church or like this
[1:48:48] sister asked her when was I saved
[1:48:49] there's lots and lots of more
[1:48:51] information that brother Brandon gives
[1:48:52] to people when they ask that question
[1:48:53] when am I saved and uh there's there's
[1:48:57] lots of things there let me tell you I
[1:48:59] think the on the front lines of the
[1:49:02] battle that we fight today in terms of
[1:49:04] families and marriage and relationships
[1:49:06] and all of that
[1:49:08] the the people who are on the front line
[1:49:10] are fathers
[1:49:13] I said I think the people on the front
[1:49:16] lines are men men of God
[1:49:20] and I believe you've got to have an
[1:49:22] attitude of rejecting passivity and take
[1:49:23] responsibility and and uh you know just
[1:49:26] stand stand solid and what you know and
[1:49:29] remember what we said in Deuteronomy
[1:49:31] it's got to be in thine heart then teach
[1:49:33] your children
[1:49:35] be prepared to teach it diligently
[1:49:38] but you have to teach it to your
[1:49:40] children once it's in your heart
[1:49:42] so the question has to be settled for
[1:49:44] you and then you can help settle it for
[1:49:46] somebody else
[1:49:48] and to me that's what fathers do that's
[1:49:51] that's the fatherhood of God it's father
[1:49:53] father God who made a a way for us to to
[1:49:57] be able to pass through that blue line
[1:49:59] right it's father God who did that and
[1:50:02] he knew we needed a savior he knew we
[1:50:04] needed an offering for sin and he made a
[1:50:07] way for that
[1:50:08] God sees ahead God knows what what we
[1:50:11] have need of and I I believe the same
[1:50:13] way that you as natural fathers you've
[1:50:16] got a bit of that in you where you're
[1:50:18] looking at your kids and saying you know
[1:50:19] what we gotta we gotta talk about some
[1:50:22] things we gotta deal with some things we
[1:50:23] gotta we gotta plan we gotta sit down we
[1:50:26] gotta look look a little bit up the road
[1:50:27] here hey this might be over tomorrow
[1:50:29] right it might all end tomorrow we don't
[1:50:32] know that but I want to be found in my
[1:50:34] posted duty until that time comes amen
[1:50:36] so let me be the best father I can be
[1:50:38] let me be the best man of God that I can
[1:50:41] be because it doesn't matter what
[1:50:43] anybody else in the world does it's
[1:50:45] between me and God
[1:50:46] and so fathers you need to step up to
[1:50:49] that plate if you have not and I I don't
[1:50:51] mean to make you feel bad I'm just
[1:50:53] saying that everything in the
[1:50:55] description everything in the message
[1:50:56] here says that you know there's there's
[1:50:58] so many things God has given us to use
[1:51:00] well let's use them let's do it
[1:51:09] because
[1:51:10] your father
[1:51:12] nobody else can take your place
[1:51:15] your grandfather nobody else can take
[1:51:17] your place
[1:51:18] and God gave you those children God gave
[1:51:20] you those offspring to minister to
[1:51:23] they're in your little sphere of
[1:51:24] influence they're in your little church
[1:51:27] you know what you're you have a
[1:51:29] responsibility
[1:51:30] you have a role to play
[1:51:35] I wonder what all you fathers just stand
[1:51:37] to your feet for a moment I'd like to
[1:51:38] pray with you if you're
[1:51:40] father grandfather
[1:51:44] husband
[1:51:48] I'd just like to have a word of prayer
[1:51:49] with you but Jason this is all right and
[1:51:51] and uh
[1:51:54] you you folks that are there I wonder
[1:51:56] could we have sister bank would you like
[1:51:58] to come up and and uh
[1:52:01] just give us a little music here and
[1:52:03] what I what I just want to pray for
[1:52:05] these brothers here for a moment and all
[1:52:07] you that are still sitting uh in some
[1:52:10] way or another you probably have a
[1:52:12] connection to somebody who's standing
[1:52:14] and or maybe your husband's not here for
[1:52:16] some reason or another or father but uh
[1:52:19] I want you just to be praying for them
[1:52:20] as well and say uh I can't be the father
[1:52:23] otherwise I'd be standing
[1:52:25] I can't be the man of the house here so
[1:52:28] I'm praying that God will help him find
[1:52:30] his place and give him the courage to
[1:52:32] lead and give him the vision he needs
[1:52:35] for our family and give him uh you know
[1:52:38] the the the willingness to ask
[1:52:41] forgiveness
[1:52:43] and give him what he needs Lord to lead
[1:52:46] our little family
[1:52:48] you pray all the time probably for your
[1:52:50] pastor and say Lord give him what we
[1:52:51] have need of help him delete us
[1:52:54] as you look at him look kind of like a
[1:52:56] father
[1:52:57] I know some of you had bad fathers and
[1:53:00] the the experience and the memories are
[1:53:01] not good I know that
[1:53:04] but you know With God all things are
[1:53:06] possible
[1:53:07] God can help refresh that God can help
[1:53:10] gives give you a
[1:53:12] an understanding above that
[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:18] let's pray father we thank you Lord for
[1:53:22] these men of God that standing here
[1:53:24] today Lord and I I know in every every
[1:53:27] Church whatever we do to strengthen
[1:53:29] families we strengthen the church
[1:53:30] because the church is really just a
[1:53:32] group of families
[1:53:34] and when we come together we're called a
[1:53:36] family of God
[1:53:38] and one day we'll all be gathered
[1:53:40] together from all ages in one place and
[1:53:42] we'll be called a family of God and
[1:53:44] it'll all go back to the way it was
[1:53:46] supposed to be
[1:53:48] but Lord I realize these men face unique
[1:53:51] challenges today that probably no other
[1:53:54] age ever faced
[1:53:57] and have to deal with
[1:53:59] not only rampant immorality
[1:54:04] but technology that doesn't quit
[1:54:07] governments that don't cooperate
[1:54:10] [Music]

[1:54:36] and may they firmly stand on the front
[1:54:39] line of the battle
[1:54:40] for their family
[1:54:44] and I ask oh God that you would Empower
[1:54:46] them and anoint them to do what is right
[1:54:48] in your eyes
[1:54:51] and Lord may they all be like Jesse at
[1:54:55] the end of the day May they be
[1:54:56] remembered like we remembered Jesse now
[1:54:59] a great man of God maybe didn't bring
[1:55:03] down walls of Jericho and maybe didn't
[1:55:06] slay Giants
[1:55:07] but he did a great thing
[1:55:09] [Music]
[1:55:12] I pray Lord you would bless these men
[1:55:16] guide them in your perfect will
[1:55:18] stop them prevent them Lord from going
[1:55:22] astray and some other
[1:55:24] some other notion or idea that isn't
[1:55:27] your will
[1:55:30] but may they esteem your word above
[1:55:32] their necessary meat
[1:55:37] and Lord let their children see them
[1:55:40] pray

[1:57:46] he my
[1:57:50] life
[1:57:51] oh Lord
[1:57:54] be glorified
[1:57:58] day
[1:58:02] you know why
[1:58:04] I was thinking about that statement
[1:58:07] and you know
[1:58:10] the brother Branham says here
[1:58:13] Jesus died
[1:58:15] that he might breed back
[1:58:18] that is an astonishing statement I think
[1:58:22] it it took a profit to put it to that
[1:58:25] level
[1:58:26] Jesus died that he might breed back and
[1:58:31] brother Branham says the same way I feel
[1:58:33] about that oh Hallelujah
[1:58:37] only the blood
[1:58:39] can do that
[1:58:42] only the blood can do that only through
[1:58:45] the chemistry of the blood of Jesus
[1:58:48] Christ can breed back again a person
[1:58:52] that won't vary one word from what God
[1:58:56] said
[1:58:57] that that that's quite a lot you know
[1:59:01] and I was thinking I was appreciating
[1:59:02] all of the husbands and fathers and
[1:59:04] grandfathers who stood
[1:59:07] but you know I I want to say you know to
[1:59:11] the sisters married and single
[1:59:14] you know to the married sisters pray for
[1:59:17] your husband
[1:59:19] to stand in that position
[1:59:22] you sisters who aren't married yet trust
[1:59:25] me that's the kind of husband you're
[1:59:27] going to want to have don't have
[1:59:29] anything to do with a man unless you can
[1:59:33] see him look just like that
[1:59:35] unless that has happened in his life
[1:59:38] don't have nothing to do with it amen
[1:59:41] that that'd be the best advice I could
[1:59:44] give single sisters you make sure you
[1:59:46] find a man that has came through the
[1:59:49] blood of the who's been bred back to be
[1:59:53] the kind of person that will vary one
[1:59:57] word because I can tell you when you
[1:59:59] start facing life you're going to want
[2:00:01] somebody that won't vary one word not
[2:00:05] even one word I have come all over these
[2:00:08] years to sow trust in the word of God
[2:00:11] you know I when somebody comes to me and
[2:00:15] I appreciate it brother berries
[2:00:17] approach to that here he gets that
[2:00:20] fantastic question
[2:00:22] and you know what he he made a decision
[2:00:24] his mind immediately went to well let me
[2:00:27] give her what the word says I have found
[2:00:30] not only have I always found victory in
[2:00:33] that I've only found Victory all the
[2:00:35] time in that and somebody comes to me
[2:00:38] with a question my mind immediately
[2:00:40] starts thinking okay what word applies
[2:00:42] this because I know there's a word that
[2:00:44] applies to whatever you can face and I'm
[2:00:46] here to tell you something friends when
[2:00:47] you when you give somebody the word I
[2:00:49] just did that recently had a young
[2:00:52] sister come to me for some career advice
[2:00:54] and I just gave her the word and I said
[2:00:55] look here's what the word now don't
[2:00:56] don't forget
[2:00:57] [Music]
[2:00:59] and within within a day I'm already
[2:01:01] getting a testimony back it's exactly I
[2:01:03] took your advice exactly and here's what
[2:01:06] happened and it all came out good amen
[2:01:08] and and that that that is so thrilling
[2:01:11] to minister of the Gospel who spends his
[2:01:16] life who has dedicated his life to the
[2:01:19] service of God's family by ministering
[2:01:22] the word of God and there is nothing of
[2:01:25] such prevailing power as a revelation of
[2:01:29] God's word you can I I literally can say
[2:01:33] to you young men young sisters old
[2:01:35] married single there you can you can
[2:01:41] Bank your soul you can bet your life on
[2:01:45] the word of God you can absolutely
[2:01:48] disregard anything and just say I'll put
[2:01:51] my whole life on every word of God I
[2:01:55] promise you you'll come out good
[2:01:58] oh the word of God is the only thing
[2:02:01] Satan is completely powerless to deal
[2:02:04] with when you believe the word of God he
[2:02:07] has no remedy for that not wonderful
[2:02:10] when you believe the word of God Satan
[2:02:12] has nothing he can do because he cannot
[2:02:14] defeat the word of God I appreciate it
[2:02:17] today
[2:02:18] and this whole weekend and today
[2:02:21] especially for the balanced
[2:02:25] Direct
[2:02:27] Simplicity of the word of God that
[2:02:31] literally puts puts to silence all
[2:02:34] gainsayers all naysayers people who talk
[2:02:38] about this and talk about that and you
[2:02:40] know the unfairness of this or you all
[2:02:42] believe that or it's all about this and
[2:02:43] you're all just don't call you know
[2:02:44] forget it forget it God made it so
[2:02:48] simple and Christ did all the work
[2:02:52] and offers it to you for free
[2:02:54] I remember years ago brother Lee blue
[2:02:57] our great friend
[2:02:59] and he said
[2:03:01] you know if somebody could if somebody
[2:03:03] could bring you
[2:03:05] uh
[2:03:06] like a pill or a vitamin
[2:03:09] and he said and all you had to do was
[2:03:12] take that and it would give you
[2:03:15] eternal life
[2:03:16] it would turn you back to Eternal youth
[2:03:19] it would give you an eternal world it
[2:03:21] would give you joy unspeakable you would
[2:03:24] never have a sorrow again he said what
[2:03:26] would the value how much would you be
[2:03:28] willing to pay he said every human in
[2:03:32] the in the world would empty their bank
[2:03:34] account to buy that and he said well I
[2:03:37] got a pill that won't cost you a dime
[2:03:40] that won't cost you a dime it's totally
[2:03:42] free it's the gospel

[2:04:08] know you know the answer to the greatest
[2:04:11] question that mankind faces question

[2:04:22] explorers and kings and Monarch and they
[2:04:26] sent expeditions and they sent armies
[2:04:28] and they tried to do everything to find
[2:04:30] the answer that you got to sit here
[2:04:33] today and heard for free and there's no
[2:04:36] question about it it's sure it's signed
[2:04:39] sealed and delivered to you today are
[2:04:42] you happy in that amen there's nothing
[2:04:45] that can breed you back

[2:13:55] going to be the inaugural time when we
[2:13:59] pitch a vision to you so I'm I'm asking

[2:14:13] because I'm I feel personally very
[2:14:17] burdened to go in this direction I want

[2:14:21] brother Barry and sister Becky have a
[2:14:23] presentation they're going to give and
[2:14:25] then there's going to be some time

[2:14:30] homeschool moms are going to have
[2:14:31] questions based on the presentation
[2:14:33] based on the ideas of their own and so
[2:14:35] we're going to have a part of it that's
[2:14:37] more of a monologue and then we're going
[2:14:39] to have a part that is more of a
[2:14:40] dialogue so it starts at four o'clock
[2:14:42] and we want to invite anyone raising
[2:14:47] children to come to it amen it'll be a
[2:14:51] personal favor to me if you can make
