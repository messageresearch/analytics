[37:31] pray and we thank you let church say
[37:32] amen
[37:34] amen if you have your bibles let's turn
[37:37] to um
[37:41] saint john chapter one
[37:44] saint john
[37:48] chapter one
[37:58] let's start reading that verse eleven
[38:00] and from there we're gonna go to second
[38:02] peter chapter 1.
[38:04] john 1
[38:07] and 11. the bible says
[38:11] he came unto his own and his own
[38:14] received him not
[38:16] but as many as receive him to them
[38:21] gave he power to become sons of god
[38:25] even to them that believe on his
[38:29] name which were born not of
[38:33] blood nor of the will of the flesh
[38:36] nor of the will of man but of
[38:39] god the word was made flesh
[38:43] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[38:46] glory
[38:48] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[38:50] father
[38:51] full of grace and truth
[38:55] amen second peter chapter one
[39:10] for me verse of scripture let's um
[39:15] start at verse five now let's back up to
[39:18] four
[39:20] it says whereby are given unto us
[39:22] exceeding and great and precious
[39:24] promises that
[39:25] by these ye might be partakers
[39:28] of the divine nature having escaped the
[39:31] corruption
[39:32] that is in the world through lust and
[39:35] besides this given all diligence
[39:37] add to your faith virtue and to virtue
[39:40] knowledge and to knowledge
[39:42] temperance and to temperance patience
[39:45] and to patience godliness and to
[39:48] godliness brotherly kindness
[39:50] and to brother kindness charity
[39:53] for if these things be in you and abound
[39:58] they make you that ye shall neither be
[40:01] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[40:04] of the lord jesus christ
[40:07] amen the lord blessed are you love his
[40:08] word you can have your seats
[40:14] amen tonight by god's grace i want to
[40:18] use for
[40:19] a simple thought if i may
[40:23] spiritual alignment spiritual
[40:27] alignment you know uh
[40:31] i think it's very important in the day
[40:33] we end
[40:35] for us as believers to make sure
[40:38] that we're solid on the word
[40:41] you know that we're not just taking a
[40:43] man's word for it
[40:45] but we're we're in our bibles we're
[40:48] studying our message and
[40:49] our life is aligned with the word of god
[40:54] because many times people hear the word
[40:56] but their life is not lining up with the
[40:59] word
[41:00] therefore it's no good what you're
[41:02] hearing amen
[41:03] so uh our whole duty is to
[41:07] be in check be lined up with the word of
[41:09] god
[41:10] and you know uh what's so special about
[41:12] our day
[41:14] god sent a word to make sure we were in
[41:17] line with his thoughts
[41:19] to make sure we were in line with what
[41:22] is preceding us a rapture amen
[41:25] you know so if we stay with what god has
[41:27] come
[41:28] and revealed to us you know you ask the
[41:31] question how can i miss it
[41:33] i'm in line with it amen i'm lined up
[41:36] right with the word
[41:37] so everything that comes after that
[41:40] should happen in my life
[41:41] you know because what i was thinking
[41:43] today that you know when we think of the
[41:45] word of god we think of the promises of
[41:47] god amen
[41:48] but one thing i want you to understand
[41:50] every word of god
[41:52] is a promise hallelujah
[41:56] it's not just you know you you look at a
[41:58] something in a certain statement
[42:00] or you say god said he'll do this but no
[42:03] every word
[42:04] hallelujah that proceedeth out of the
[42:06] mouth of god
[42:07] is a promise because he can't change it
[42:10] he can't take it back
[42:11] so whatever he said it has to come to
[42:14] pass
[42:15] so church the prophet of god said to us
[42:18] that when it comes to the word of god if
[42:21] you
[42:22] just take that same word and align
[42:24] yourself with that word
[42:26] you'll get the same results why because
[42:29] god can't change
[42:31] god can't lie god came out to his word
[42:34] god can't make no mistakes hallelujah so
[42:37] if we
[42:38] line up with the word it'll come out
[42:41] like it always does
[42:42] hallelujah but when you think of
[42:46] in alignment hallelujah you know this is
[42:48] kind of for the brothers but
[42:50] sisters will give you a little 101 of
[42:52] what it means to be aligned
[42:54] you know you take a car you know and you
[42:57] got fresh
[42:58] you got four fresh brand new tires
[43:02] and you know uh they look nice and they
[43:04] shiny and
[43:05] and they fit the car looking so good but
[43:08] if those tires are not aligned
[43:10] and they're not balanced you have a
[43:12] rough ride
[43:14] you can be driving a 600 000 mercedes
[43:18] benz
[43:19] but if those tires are not aligned the
[43:22] ride will be just
[43:22] as rough as a 30 000 wrangler jeep
[43:28] why because it's the alignment that
[43:31] makes the ride smooth
[43:33] wow and you wonder why we don't see god
[43:36] in our lives
[43:37] like we are too it's simple get in line
[43:40] with the word
[43:42] hallelujah you get in line with the word
[43:44] and things will smooth out
[43:46] things will ride alone like it's
[43:47] supposed to hallelujah
[43:49] you know when things are alive right you
[43:52] can hear them bump
[43:53] and sometimes you don't even feel it
[43:55] [Music]
[44:04] in alignment you know when your car is
[44:08] out of line
[44:10] what happens it wears down
[44:14] the wheels faster than they have to be
[44:18] and you could be driving and ignoring it
[44:20] driving and ignoring it
[44:21] but then it'll come a time where your
[44:24] car
[44:24] will start to pull a certain direction
[44:28] simply because it's out of line and as a
[44:31] believer or
[44:32] as a christian per se if your life
[44:36] is not in line with the word of god holy
[44:39] your flesh will begin to pull you in a
[44:43] direction
[44:44] in which you're aligned with hallelujah
[44:47] you're not just out there freelancing no
[44:50] you're in line to go a certain direction
[44:52] but this is the question is it god's way
[44:55] or is it your way
[44:57] hallelujah amen the alignment
[45:00] is no good without the proper balance
[45:04] oh hallelujah so you say oh brother
[45:06] diggs
[45:07] i know the prophet said this the prophet
[45:09] said that you got to have the right
[45:11] balance
[45:12] in the scripture for all of it to be
[45:14] smoothed
[45:18] because if you got that alignment and no
[45:21] balance
[45:22] your ride will still be rough
[45:27] hallelujah glory but you know god is
[45:30] coming he's
[45:31] sent his word just to get us to line
[45:34] back
[45:34] up and if i could run ahead a little bit
[45:37] hardly remember to profit his vision
[45:39] where he saw the church of the u.s and
[45:41] she was being led by a witch
[45:44] she was in line she was in step
[45:46] hallelujah but she was following a witch
[45:49] ma and she didn't even realize harley
[45:51] that she was marching
[45:53] to the beat of a witch hell yeah but
[45:56] then the prophet
[45:57] being able to see a true alignment he
[46:00] could say to that church
[46:01] get back his step line back up with the
[46:04] word
[46:04] so what god has come to do he sent a
[46:07] word for us
[46:08] that we can line back up with and be
[46:10] right in the channel of god
[46:12] that's why i read the scripture where it
[46:14] say to those who could receive
[46:16] god them he those are able to become
[46:20] the sons and daughters of god see he's
[46:22] giving us power
[46:24] to become something see this word it's
[46:27] not just here
[46:28] to tickle our ear no it's power to
[46:30] become
[46:31] something and that's what happens
[46:35] when you align with the word is god
[46:38] doing
[46:39] something in your life
[46:42] in alignment but how does god feel
[46:47] when you get underlined
[46:50] and you know church that car
[46:53] all four wheels have to be in line
[46:55] together
[46:57] because you can have the front two in
[46:58] line and the back two like this
[47:02] and the ride will still be wobbly
[47:04] hallelujah
[47:05] nice car but if it's not aligned right
[47:10] it'll still be wobbly church that goes
[47:13] for
[47:13] anything with wheels
[47:16] it can be attractive if it's not aligned
[47:20] hallelujah and that balance
[47:22] that ride will be rough it could be a
[47:24] wagon
[47:26] whoa it can be a motorcycle bike
[47:28] whatever hallelujah
[47:29] it has to be balanced and aligned
[47:33] so church as believers as those of us
[47:36] in this message of the hour we have to
[47:38] have the right spiritual alignment
[47:41] we can't follow things just because it
[47:43] sound good
[47:44] it has to have the right balance in it
[47:49] amen remember when the prophet preached
[47:52] marriage divorce and i'm not going to go
[47:53] into the doctrine of it
[47:54] but he said you got some who go this far
[47:57] that way
[47:58] and then you got some who go too far
[48:01] this way
[48:01] he said if there's a scriptural question
[48:04] it has to be a scriptural answer
[48:06] hallelujah so when you have questions
[48:09] that are scriptural
[48:10] look for it in the word of god don't
[48:13] wait for somebody to tell you what it
[48:15] means
[48:16] but no align yourself with the word
[48:22] you know as i was thinking about this
[48:23] thought and i ain't gonna be too long
[48:24] y'all know i'm about to close
[48:26] but as i was thinking about this thought
[48:28] i was thinking how god
[48:30] in the simplicity of who he is daily
[48:33] he's trying to keep us in line with the
[48:35] word
[48:37] simple he'll tell you go pray what is he
[48:39] doing he's keeping you in line with the
[48:41] word
[48:41] holy even if he even if god is requiring
[48:45] some worship and praise out of you he's
[48:47] trying to keep you in line
[48:49] with who he is why so he can stay close
[48:52] in your life
[48:53] because when you get out of line god
[48:56] lifts up and goes another direction
[48:59] oh my i'll give you an example of that
[49:02] god told
[49:03] in in in the book of uh samuel i think
[49:06] samuel 1 and 15. he told samuel samuel
[49:09] he told saul
[49:11] he said saul i want you to go down there
[49:12] and kill all the amla guys
[49:15] i want you to kill baby mother
[49:19] uh father ox
[49:22] cow every killer everything wipe it out
[49:26] everything that hamlet kites ever touch
[49:29] wipe it out don't have mercy on nothing
[49:33] my commandment to you is wipe it out
[49:36] but saul's problem was that word
[49:40] came through a man
[49:45] it came through a man whose name was
[49:48] samuel harlan
[49:49] but samuel got the word from where god
[49:53] and and we can see right now what's
[49:55] happening with people
[49:56] they're getting out of line man
[49:58] hallelujah thinking that the word
[50:00] william branham had
[50:01] came from him no it came from god so
[50:04] we're not aligning
[50:06] with branham's thoughts we're aligning
[50:08] with god's thoughts
[50:11] and saul he lightly esteemed what the
[50:14] prophet brought to him
[50:16] because he was looking at flesh
[50:19] and although he went out to do what god
[50:23] said he did it partially you think about
[50:26] how often
[50:27] we hear the word of god and we perform
[50:29] it partially
[50:31] god i came i pray brother man i preached
[50:33] a message called spring cleaning
[50:35] hallelujah and you know when you spring
[50:37] cleaning
[50:38] the first thing you got to do you got to
[50:40] sweep your house
[50:44] sisters know what i'm talking about you
[50:46] got to sweep your house
[50:48] you started to gather up things that you
[50:50] don't have any use for
[50:52] things that been in the closet for
[50:54] months and months and they just taking
[50:56] up space
[50:57] you know uh uh one thing i realized
[50:59] church
[51:00] you can build a 400 000 house
[51:03] but if nobody never stays in that brand
[51:06] new house
[51:06] it'll develop cobwebs
[51:10] hallelujah brand new it'll develop
[51:13] cobwebs
[51:14] if you never turn the water on hungry
[51:17] the pipes will get rusty
[51:20] if you never flush the toilet hallelujah
[51:22] it stands to get clogged up
[51:24] so everything about it has to be used or
[51:28] filled one point or the other you can't
[51:31] just have a house
[51:32] that's never been used hallelujah and
[51:35] you know what i think in this
[51:36] hour where it's time out for just good
[51:39] church members
[51:40] what is god getting usury out of your
[51:42] life
[51:44] amen because remember look at the simple
[51:47] alignment
[51:49] he had three men he gave one five
[51:52] talents
[51:53] he gave one two and he gave one one
[51:56] now he gave them according to their
[51:59] ability
[52:00] now he knew that the one who had five
[52:02] could bring back five more
[52:04] god will never give you more than you
[52:06] can handle
[52:08] wow and some of us feel like we're in a
[52:11] whirlwind
[52:12] he won't give you more than you can
[52:14] handle
[52:15] so i say to you right now if you're in a
[52:18] whirlwind
[52:19] stand on your feet and say god is on my
[52:22] side
[52:23] hallelujah if i'm in a whirlwind that
[52:26] means god
[52:26] put me there if i don't confess god put
[52:30] me there
[52:30] i'm giving the devil control over my
[52:32] life
[52:34] are you with me and that goes with
[52:37] anything we do as believers
[52:39] we have to align ourself with the
[52:41] scripture
[52:42] to know that nothing can happen to us
[52:46] except god allows it and y'all hear me
[52:48] say that so often
[52:50] hallelujah because it's a revelation to
[52:52] me
[52:55] so i look at things a little bit
[52:56] different you know some breakdowns
[52:59] just happened that that happened i'd be
[53:01] like oh oh lord what you feel to do
[53:05] in times past before i got the
[53:07] revelation before i realized the
[53:09] alignment
[53:10] harley things was happening you know
[53:12] what i'd say this is the devil
[53:18] how often we do that everything is not
[53:22] the devil
[53:23] hallelujah and if it is the devil god is
[53:26] using him
[53:28] so it's really not the devil the devil
[53:31] can't even be himself
[53:33] the devil's being used by ow the devil's
[53:37] being used by god
[53:38] the devil said oh look what i did i did
[53:41] this i did that and god said no i'll let
[53:42] you
[53:46] hallelujah it's like going to uh uh
[53:50] for those of us brothers who have young
[53:52] boys and say when your boy was
[53:54] five or six and he'd be like come on
[53:56] daddy let's race and you know you can
[53:58] beat them
[53:59] so you go out there and race them and
[54:00] you beat them and you beat them and you
[54:02] be like
[54:02] oh oh who i can't make i can't make it
[54:04] and he wins he was like ah
[54:06] daddy i beat you ah i beat you and
[54:09] you like
[54:10] yeah right
[54:13] because you know you have you know what
[54:15] kind of ability
[54:16] you have inside of you and you know that
[54:19] at that age
[54:20] that child is not fast enough to be able
[54:23] to beat you hallelujah
[54:24] so what i'm saying in this age the devil
[54:27] is not strong enough
[54:29] to be able to beat you hallelujah holy
[54:32] if we are aligned with the right word
[54:35] amen think about the church holly the
[54:38] prophet of god
[54:39] he said when jesus christ gave his life
[54:42] everything that adam lost is restored
[54:50] amen
[54:53] everything is restored
[54:57] what god-like characteristics
[55:01] god like nature what was adam before the
[55:05] fall
[55:06] he was in line with god
[55:09] wow he was so much in line with god god
[55:12] brought creation to adam
[55:14] and he said you name everything why
[55:17] because he knew
[55:18] adam would not venture out in some
[55:20] strange area
[55:21] he would say only what god would say
[55:24] hallelujah and now all of that has been
[55:27] restored unto us
[55:31] but let's go back let's go back um saul
[55:33] right quick
[55:36] god said go down there kill everything
[55:37] wipe it out kill the baby the mama the
[55:40] husband
[55:41] the the the sheep the oxen kill king egg
[55:44] kill it all and it looked like it looks
[55:47] like god is
[55:48] uh very unmerciful but no god always has
[55:51] a purpose in everything he does
[55:54] and now he gives that commandment and
[55:57] and saul goes out
[55:59] he heard the word come back from samuel
[56:01] he's like okay i'm going to do it
[56:03] he goes down there to the amalekites he
[56:06] wipe out
[56:07] everything that's not pleasant to the
[56:08] eye
[56:11] don't that sound like some of us
[56:15] god said get rid of this get rid of that
[56:18] and we'd be like well lord
[56:19] they i got it under control
[56:23] if you had it under control god wouldn't
[56:25] let it be heard in your ears to get rid
[56:27] of it
[56:30] holy a lot of times we hear things that
[56:33] are coming direct to us
[56:34] and we look and see who else is in the
[56:36] church who god talking to you
[56:42] oh i see anthony here he must be talking
[56:44] to anthony
[56:46] i see jd here he might be you can't be
[56:48] talking to me must be talking to him
[56:51] he can't be talking like he must be
[56:54] talking again again kate be talking to
[56:56] me
[56:58] that's what we do we uh what's that word
[57:01] we
[57:01] uh deflect we always deflect
[57:06] when god brings a word to bring us in
[57:09] line
[57:10] but we deflect we were like no lord i'm
[57:12] good i'm good
[57:14] can you imagine that you and i all of us
[57:18] we having a one-on-one with god and we
[57:19] tell god i'm good
[57:23] i couldn't even fix my mouth to tell god
[57:25] i'm good
[57:27] because if he's bringing a word for me
[57:29] to get in line i'm like
[57:31] help me lord i can't see what you see
[57:34] and sometimes god will bring a word for
[57:37] what you're about to face down the world
[57:39] down the road and if you're not
[57:41] receptable to it hallelujah
[57:43] when you get there you hit it like a
[57:45] brick wall
[57:47] because you may have thought that word
[57:48] wasn't for you
[57:50] now if i ask the question tonight how
[57:52] many of us can say
[57:54] that all of the word is not for us
[57:58] it's for all of us you say well the
[58:01] the preaching you're here preaching
[58:03] about a promiscuous woman you were like
[58:04] not me i'm married
[58:06] i got my husband i ain't doing none of
[58:07] that but what if you didn't have that
[58:09] husband
[58:11] you'd be in the same boat that woman was
[58:13] in hollywood
[58:15] so really that word is a word of grace
[58:17] to you because you're not fulfilling it
[58:18] right now
[58:20] hallelujah so church when you think
[58:22] about when you when you look at a uh
[58:24] saul saul goes down there and he saves a
[58:27] little bit of this and he saves a little
[58:28] bit of that
[58:29] and then he tries to get real spiritual
[58:31] with his alignment
[58:33] and he says you know what i'm going to
[58:35] keep these sheep i'm going to keep these
[58:37] oxen
[58:38] and you know what we're going to do
[58:39] we're going to sacrifice it unto the
[58:41] lord
[58:41] god didn't say go down there and prepare
[58:43] me to sacrifice
[58:47] why don't we do that god try to deal
[58:50] with us and we try to get more spiritual
[58:52] in god
[58:57] can you see this man try to get more
[58:58] spiritual than god
[59:00] god didn't ask for a sacrifice he said
[59:03] go down there and wipe it out
[59:05] basically god was saying ain't nothing
[59:07] down there i won't
[59:09] kill it all it's a hindrance to me
[59:12] so he begins to uh save a little bit of
[59:15] this and save a little bit of that
[59:16] and then the worst thing he could do he
[59:19] even spared the life of the king
[59:21] amen this man was out of lying bad
[59:28] you know how you can tell your card in
[59:29] line
[59:31] sisters i'm finna give you a lesson
[59:35] this is how you know your card line
[59:37] tonight when you're driving home
[59:39] if you let the steering wheel go and it
[59:42] doesn't stay in a straight line
[59:44] if it goes to a hard right
[59:47] or hard left it's definitely out of line
[59:53] just go home and tell your husband say
[59:55] honey we need to set an appointment with
[59:56] my car out of line
[59:58] you say how do you say how do you know
[1:00:00] you say well i turned the steering wheel
[1:00:02] loose
[1:00:03] and it ran wild on me
[1:00:08] oh that's how you know somebody's not
[1:00:11] where they're supposed to be
[1:00:12] the first opportunity they get to stay
[1:00:14] home hallelujah
[1:00:16] called coleman 19 they went hard right
[1:00:20] and we hadn't seen them since
[1:00:23] out of line
[1:00:27] and then they say oh brother i'm gonna
[1:00:28] stay home and i'm gonna watch it on the
[1:00:31] on the owner streaming oh my they out of
[1:00:33] balance
[1:00:37] i ain't saying you ain't got the vehicle
[1:00:40] i'm saying you got to be balanced
[1:00:43] and you got to be aligned because if you
[1:00:45] turn that thing
[1:00:46] loose and it just runs wild man you let
[1:00:50] that
[1:00:50] mess around hit somebody
[1:00:53] or run off the road
[1:00:56] but if you turn it loose
[1:01:00] if you have an opportunity just say for
[1:01:02] instance this church
[1:01:04] bethel bethel decides to uh
[1:01:07] come to south carolina we have joint
[1:01:09] meetings and some of y'all can't make it
[1:01:11] and you say man that's my opportunity to
[1:01:13] go to the movies
[1:01:18] you better take your alignment
[1:01:22] but if you align right you do everything
[1:01:25] you can to make sure you get
[1:01:27] something from that
[1:01:30] and this is the time we should be in we
[1:01:33] shouldn't be looking for breaks
[1:01:38] we should be looking for more of god in
[1:01:41] every area of our lives
[1:01:50] i've been preaching on influence and you
[1:01:53] know i i
[1:01:54] what i did with the message influence i

[1:03:18] fall under the influence of something
[1:03:20] and not

[1:03:55] why because the whole world has been
[1:03:57] influenced by this particular thing
[1:04:00] everybody jumped in line
[1:04:03] in a worldly alignment hallelujah and
[1:04:06] some people got
[1:04:07] so aligned with it that they forgot
[1:04:10] about the spiritual alignment
[1:04:13] holly hey man it's easy to get aligned
[1:04:16] with the things of the world and forget
[1:04:18] that god has already answered this
[1:04:20] question
[1:04:21] god has already told us hallelujah that
[1:04:23] black stripes were healed
[1:04:25] god has already told us if we partake of
[1:04:28] any deadly thing it will not harm us
[1:04:31] isn't it the word of god so why are we
[1:04:34] so
[1:04:35] fearful a couple months ago
[1:04:39] we all were hungry we dropped into a
[1:04:41] carnal alignment
[1:04:42] you know what it was how he was called
[1:04:45] republican or democrat
[1:04:49] and we aligned ourselves by which team
[1:04:51] we're on
[1:04:52] when god had already sent a spiritual
[1:04:54] alignment and told us
[1:04:56] watch russia don't worry about all these
[1:04:58] politics
[1:05:06] i was in a church i was preaching and i
[1:05:08] said i made a statement i said i
[1:05:10] wouldn't mind if trump get another four
[1:05:11] years
[1:05:16] and you know they was looking at me like
[1:05:17] i was crazy why because i was first a
[1:05:18] black man
[1:05:21] and they have all these different
[1:05:22] movements but then when i said that it
[1:05:24] was like
[1:05:25] a man
[1:05:28] because it's considered to be a red
[1:05:30] state
[1:05:32] but then it turned into a blue
[1:05:35] and i told him i said say just put your
[1:05:37] hands down
[1:05:39] i said put your hands down i'm not
[1:05:41] saying that for the reasons you think
[1:05:43] my reasons are not political i say i
[1:05:46] could take another four years of him
[1:05:48] because he's the funniest president we
[1:05:49] ever had
[1:05:52] and he's always got something crazy to
[1:05:54] say that's not political
[1:05:58] they say oh oh oh mr trump do you think
[1:06:02] do you think joel will joe will attract
[1:06:04] the big crowd
[1:06:05] out here in connecticut or wherever he
[1:06:07] says no
[1:06:09] joe only attracts flies
[1:06:11] [Music]
[1:06:12] [Applause]
[1:06:15] [Music]
[1:06:17] who would love four more years of that
[1:06:20] [Music]

[1:06:28] but you know saw
[1:06:32] see you can't you can't stay with that
[1:06:33] stuff too long people get offended
[1:06:37] get the right alignment
[1:06:41] no matter who the president is one thing
[1:06:44] i want you to realize
[1:06:45] it's god's choice
[1:06:49] i don't know about you but i'm team
[1:06:50] jesus hallelujah
[1:06:53] so it don't matter who get in office my
[1:06:55] team always wins
[1:06:58] hallelujah we're never in a recession
[1:07:05] because god is never lacking anything
[1:07:07] church let me move on
[1:07:08] he says look he takes he takes back uh
[1:07:12] all the cute nice things and you know
[1:07:14] that's what we do
[1:07:15] we'll keep the things that's close in
[1:07:18] our vicinity
[1:07:19] that we don't think is harming nobody
[1:07:21] and god has told you plainly
[1:07:23] get rid of it line yourself up get rid
[1:07:27] of it hallelujah
[1:07:29] you know why i'm on here and i'm talking
[1:07:30] about influence you know uh
[1:07:32] uh parents it'll be uh uh you're due to
[1:07:36] your job
[1:07:37] to check your children's phones out
[1:07:40] don't just assume that they're not doing
[1:07:42] anything
[1:07:43] if they don't have the holy ghost what
[1:07:45] else can they do
[1:07:48] but be pulled into something that they
[1:07:50] shouldn't be pulled into
[1:07:52] this new stuff called tick-tock that's
[1:07:54] not just about dancing
[1:07:58] you thought that was just about you
[1:08:02] no it's one that's just a hook
[1:08:06] they got all kind of sexual things all
[1:08:08] kind of lustful things
[1:08:09] all kinds of things on it but they hide
[1:08:11] it under the umbrella
[1:08:13] of something that seems like it's not
[1:08:14] that bad
[1:08:17] but if you're not a parent that's
[1:08:18] checking up on these things
[1:08:20] your child will take a hard right
[1:08:27] and i'm old school why does a 12 year
[1:08:29] old need a cell phone anyway
[1:08:36] i'd be like you ain't got no job what
[1:08:38] you need a phone ball
[1:08:40] i can't i i gotta talk to my friend you
[1:08:42] see them at school tomorrow
[1:08:46] if what how many hours they be in school
[1:08:48] somebody tell me i can't even remember
[1:08:50] eight hours if y'all if eight hours
[1:08:53] ain't long enough to see that person
[1:08:54] something wrong
[1:08:56] you'll be there at school eight hours
[1:08:58] with them and you tell me you gotta come
[1:08:59] home and talk to them too
[1:09:01] man something right about that but you
[1:09:06] know what we do
[1:09:07] we get influenced we get a hair where
[1:09:10] you know someone so
[1:09:11] uh someone so got their child phone and
[1:09:13] you know hey
[1:09:14] you know i got i got to keep in touch
[1:09:16] with them and this and that well let me
[1:09:17] ask you something when you was the age
[1:09:19] who
[1:09:19] how does your parents keep in touch with
[1:09:20] you
[1:09:22] amen oh i know you had a beeper
[1:09:29] you had a pager yeah yeah yeah used to
[1:09:32] stop to the phone move every time they
[1:09:34] call you
[1:09:34] well mom yeah mom i'm at recess
[1:09:40] through that scene you see i know we
[1:09:42] laughing but you see how carnal
[1:09:44] things have gotten hurt we're being
[1:09:46] influenced hungry
[1:09:48] by the tactics and the and the the the
[1:09:51] the generalizations of the world and
[1:09:54] we're just
[1:09:54] going right along with it when we're
[1:09:57] supposed to be able to see these things
[1:09:59] and stop it in its tracks i ain't saying
[1:10:02] being fanatical but i'm saying
[1:10:03] hollywood some things need to be
[1:10:05] questioned
[1:10:07] hallelujah i know you're going to say
[1:10:10] well
[1:10:12] you know i got to deal with basketball
[1:10:13] yeah do what's best for your house
[1:10:15] by no by all means don't do what i do in
[1:10:17] mine
[1:10:19] do what you need to do in yours
[1:10:21] hallelujah but at the same time
[1:10:24] make sure you're aligned with what god
[1:10:27] wants you to do
[1:10:27] [Music]
[1:10:29] because me being in line with god
[1:10:31] hallelujah might mean no 12 year olds
[1:10:33] can't have no phone in my house
[1:10:37] but again the alignment in miles might
[1:10:40] mean that 12 year old can go get a job
[1:10:50] so move according to the convictions of
[1:10:52] your spiritual alignment amen
[1:10:54] but anyway saul comes saul comes back
[1:10:58] and now he's saying you know uh uh he
[1:11:00] did what the lord wanted
[1:11:02] samuel comes down there he says hey did
[1:11:04] you do what god said
[1:11:05] he said yes i did everything he says
[1:11:07] what is this bleeding of the sheep out
[1:11:09] here
[1:11:10] i hear sheep over here uh uh making
[1:11:13] fusses and nars
[1:11:14] and everything and this and that and he
[1:11:16] said well i did what god told he said no
[1:11:18] you didn't
[1:11:19] you did not god told you to go down and
[1:11:21] kill everything
[1:11:23] and you know what king hey guys go back
[1:11:25] and read it he was standing over there
[1:11:27] in the corner
[1:11:28] thought he was hiding but the word saw
[1:11:30] him hallelujah
[1:11:31] the word sorry but it still remain the
[1:11:34] same
[1:11:35] somebody has to be able to carry out
[1:11:37] what god has said
[1:11:40] no matter who get hurts somebody in the
[1:11:42] church
[1:11:43] has to be able to keep the word of god
[1:11:47] and samuel sitting there hallelujah look
[1:11:49] at that egg
[1:11:50] and he says just as you have made a
[1:11:53] mother motherless
[1:11:54] so will your mother
[1:11:57] y'all know i'm dramatic
[1:12:00] but i can just imagine being out of it
[1:12:02] like yeah that's how
[1:12:04] that's how you do it that's how you keep
[1:12:06] the word of god
[1:12:09] it might not look right but that's how
[1:12:11] if god said kill him
[1:12:12] you kill him amen
[1:12:21] samuel wiped him out and it wasn't even
[1:12:24] samuel's commission he told saul to do
[1:12:28] that
[1:12:30] don't get nervous church
[1:12:33] the prophet of god said when you won't
[1:12:37] be led
[1:12:38] by the spirit of the lord you'll be led
[1:12:40] by an evil spirit
[1:12:42] and he said right there the spirit of
[1:12:45] the lord
[1:12:46] left saul and an evil spirit came
[1:12:51] simply because he would not align
[1:12:53] himself
[1:12:55] with the word of god and he still
[1:12:58] thought he was good
[1:13:01] he still considered himself to be the
[1:13:03] king
[1:13:05] like everything was good till he found
[1:13:06] himself oh boy this is rich y'all
[1:13:08] pulling real good
[1:13:10] some good stuff coming to me you know he
[1:13:12] found himself
[1:13:14] you know sitting in church getting
[1:13:16] colder and colder
[1:13:18] we used to could have fellowship with
[1:13:20] samuel samuel ain't around no more
[1:13:23] but he's still king now he's still king
[1:13:26] but his life ain't the same no more
[1:13:27] what's happened it was that hard left
[1:13:32] and his life got so bad hallelujah that
[1:13:35] he lost the touch of god
[1:13:37] he lost the inspiration to god he got so
[1:13:39] bad
[1:13:40] that that false alignment led him in the
[1:13:43] arms of a witch
[1:13:51] don't play with disobedience
[1:13:56] him by simply not doing
[1:13:59] keeping the commandment of god not
[1:14:01] lining up
[1:14:02] with the word of god led him to the
[1:14:05] destiny of fellowship
[1:14:07] with a witch
[1:14:11] a man who once prophesied spoken tongues
[1:14:14] and walk with the people of god
[1:14:17] and now he's fellowshipping with a witch
[1:14:21] and i'm gonna say this one time and i'm
[1:14:22] gonna move on what do you think is gonna
[1:14:25] happen to the people that have left this
[1:14:27] truth
[1:14:29] they're not going to something greater
[1:14:33] it's leading them into a hard right or
[1:14:35] hard left
[1:14:38] remember the vehicle is no good without
[1:14:41] the proper balance and alignment
[1:14:48] they say oh y'all follow a man no i said
[1:14:50] the proper balance
[1:14:57] oh my and the spirit of god left him
[1:15:00] from that point an evil spirit came
[1:15:04] it was so bad he couldn't sleep at night
[1:15:07] demons jump on him he can't sleep at
[1:15:09] night he said bring me somebody
[1:15:10] that gonna fresh me bring me somebody
[1:15:12] that's lined up with god
[1:15:14] they brought him david oh my what did
[1:15:17] they bring
[1:15:18] they brought a man that was anointed by
[1:15:20] the same prophet's hands
[1:15:25] had the same horn of oil poured over his
[1:15:28] head
[1:15:29] by the same prophet
[1:15:34] oh my whoa what was happening
[1:15:38] it was now a paradigm shift hallelujah
[1:15:41] god was moving away from sorrow
[1:15:43] and putting david in that seat
[1:15:44] hallelujah but you know what i love
[1:15:46] about
[1:15:46] it david was not prepared for it
[1:15:54] he couldn't rely on how good he looked
[1:15:56] he couldn't rely on how good his clothes
[1:15:58] was
[1:15:59] when david was anointed he didn't even
[1:16:02] have time to take a bath
[1:16:07] hallelujah his brothers was all afreshed
[1:16:10] you know they probably put a hat on some
[1:16:12] good sprays
[1:16:15] i don't know they probably had on some
[1:16:16] brute
[1:16:18] they thought they were rugged
[1:16:24] and they come before the king and god
[1:16:25] said no no no no no no no
[1:16:28] they will not align with my word what
[1:16:30] did he say
[1:16:31] he said i want a man out of my very own
[1:16:33] heart
[1:16:36] he wasn't worried about how fresh he was
[1:16:38] his clothes and how
[1:16:39] how good he smells i know i want
[1:16:41] somebody who's gonna line up hallelujah
[1:16:44] and we know david had plenty of failures
[1:16:47] plenty of faults
[1:16:48] what was that alignment he could always
[1:16:50] repent
[1:16:51] hollywood he always found himself
[1:16:54] getting back hardly in alignment
[1:16:56] when he went to the left or to the right
[1:16:58] david always repented what did i do
[1:17:01] that brought him back to two thirty
[1:17:02] seconds
[1:17:07] you know what two thirty seconds is
[1:17:08] right
[1:17:10] two thirty seconds hallelujah or four
[1:17:12] thirty seconds
[1:17:13] hallelujah it's it's it's it's it's the
[1:17:16] it's the width
[1:17:17] of the rubber left on your tire yeah
[1:17:21] when you got two thirty seconds you
[1:17:22] still good when you hit four thirty
[1:17:25] seconds it's time for you to be looking
[1:17:26] for some more tires
[1:17:28] if i'm saying it right but i know people
[1:17:31] who drove from here to florida with wire
[1:17:34] coming out their tire
[1:17:40] thou shall not tempt the lord thy god
[1:17:50] you as a brother that's faith yeah
[1:17:58] oh i said like this you got to know god
[1:18:01] with you when you're doing stuff like
[1:18:03] that
[1:18:04] hallelujah because the prophet did drive
[1:18:06] his car down the road with one light and
[1:18:08] he knew he had one life
[1:18:12] but he got pulled over
[1:18:16] and the man told him you better fix that
[1:18:18] he said i was but the garage closed
[1:18:20] holiday
[1:18:21] but church you look now saul needs to be
[1:18:24] refreshed
[1:18:25] and god sends a man to refer look now
[1:18:28] this i want you to catch
[1:18:30] god sends a man to refresh him
[1:18:34] with the same anointing he once
[1:18:39] my god had ain't a different god it's
[1:18:41] the same god
[1:18:43] hallelujah we say i gotta get this
[1:18:45] preacher i gotta get that preacher to
[1:18:46] pray for him
[1:18:47] get this get that now it's the same
[1:18:49] anointing
[1:18:50] but where's your faith
[1:18:59] and i'm not taking away that some people
[1:19:01] have gifts
[1:19:03] but in this case david was now the
[1:19:06] anointed king and what was saul
[1:19:09] saul was once the anointed king
[1:19:13] but the difference is david could stay
[1:19:15] in line
[1:19:16] amen hallelujah so much so
[1:19:20] to that when saul got so much out of
[1:19:23] line
[1:19:24] hallelujah he found himself doing things
[1:19:26] that he wouldn't ordinarily do
[1:19:29] david saw kill his thousands
[1:19:33] david killed his tens of thousands so
[1:19:35] kill his thousands
[1:19:36] david kill his tenza saw him kill his
[1:19:39] thousand
[1:19:40] david kill his tents a thousand saucy
[1:19:43] know what they're like threw a javelin
[1:19:50] at david
[1:19:52] for only going to do what he asked him
[1:19:55] to do song was the one who told him to
[1:19:57] go kill
[1:19:58] him and now he made it man cause he did
[1:20:02] a good job
[1:20:04] you see what happens when you get out of
[1:20:07] line
[1:20:09] gonna use somebody right in your church
[1:20:12] and the spirit of jealousy will rise up
[1:20:17] actually said why are you jealous when
[1:20:19] this is your brother or your sister
[1:20:22] you got the same god
[1:20:25] let me move on i don't spend too much
[1:20:27] time with that
[1:20:28] but you look god because david was in
[1:20:31] line
[1:20:32] he could stay spiritually aligned god
[1:20:35] could continuously used him to the day
[1:20:37] he died
[1:20:39] even through his mistakes
[1:20:45] and boy did he get when i said hard left
[1:20:48] he did a hard left a u-turn ran a light
[1:20:52] stop sign everything
[1:20:54] david did all kind of stuff
[1:20:59] david david david was the equivalent of
[1:21:01] doing
[1:21:02] a hundred and fifty in a 35 mile pounds
[1:21:05] on
[1:21:09] he was reckless driving
[1:21:14] but god knew that wasn't in his heart
[1:21:19] so god gave him mercy because whenever
[1:21:23] god showed him
[1:21:23] you know he's talking to nathan we know
[1:21:25] the story he's talking to nathan he'd
[1:21:27] say david there's a man who had
[1:21:29] uh x amount of sheep in this one man had
[1:21:31] one sheep and this man who had so much
[1:21:33] came and took this man once she david
[1:21:35] said i'mma kill him
[1:21:39] i'ma kill him this is a hit-and-run
[1:21:41] i'mma
[1:21:42] kill him and then they didn't say david
[1:21:44] it was you you were drunk that night you
[1:21:45] was the one who did it
[1:21:47] he was like oh my god i have
[1:21:50] sinned now see what's happening he's
[1:21:53] getting back in line
[1:21:54] he's falling on his leaves he's not
[1:21:57] pushing it off like saul
[1:21:58] it was the people
[1:22:01] i can't go back yeah i know cove it over
[1:22:04] but them
[1:22:05] people at that church
[1:22:08] i'm so sick of hearing that
[1:22:11] then people at the church and they said
[1:22:14] this and
[1:22:14] them people them people that you know
[1:22:16] think about them people at walmart
[1:22:21] think about them people that outback
[1:22:23] when you go in there
[1:22:24] and how they look at you and how they
[1:22:26] talk about you but that don't stop you
[1:22:28] from eating your steak and potato
[1:22:36] but when it comes to church i just can't
[1:22:38] go back there no more
[1:22:41] [Music]
[1:22:44] you can find some hair in your food and
[1:22:46] go back the next week

[1:23:18] you should have them on the email
[1:23:20] but this this is in the message um
[1:23:22] restoration of the bride tree
[1:23:25] why is it important to stay with the
[1:23:27] revealed word
[1:23:29] because it keeps us in line which keeps
[1:23:32] us close to god
[1:23:35] because god is what his word and as long
[1:23:38] as we are
[1:23:39] in line with the word god is always near
[1:23:44] somebody talk to me now we got to
[1:23:46] believe that
[1:23:47] listen he says this is in uh uh
[1:23:50] restoration laboratory
[1:23:51] paragraph 133 he says now
[1:23:54] if the court writes out a word
[1:23:58] it is certain it's a certain thing a
[1:24:00] penalty
[1:24:01] he said do so and so all right now
[1:24:04] that's the word of the court and the law
[1:24:07] of the court
[1:24:08] enforces the word of the court
[1:24:12] so if there's a word that the court
[1:24:14] writes side they say uh
[1:24:16] uh 12 o'clock 12 o'clock noon every day
[1:24:20] nobody can have on blue shoes that's a
[1:24:22] law
[1:24:24] they make that a law every time they
[1:24:25] catch when any of us 12 o'clock
[1:24:27] with blue shoes on there'll be a penalty
[1:24:29] right because that's the law of the
[1:24:31] court
[1:24:32] and you have to uh uh suffer those
[1:24:35] consequences of breaking that law but if
[1:24:38] you align yourself with that law you can
[1:24:40] never be touched
[1:24:42] talk to me church in the speed limit 75
[1:24:46] and you stay 75 you'll never get a
[1:24:48] ticket
[1:24:50] hallelujah why because you're in line
[1:24:53] hallelujah
[1:24:54] you've lined yourself up holly oh dude
[1:24:57] your car can go faster but you stay in
[1:24:59] line
[1:25:00] to protect yourself hallelujah
[1:25:03] that's why the world has been given to
[1:25:05] us to protect ourselves
[1:25:08] hell yeah not to put us in bondage
[1:25:10] harley not to make us seem
[1:25:12] different no to stay under god's
[1:25:14] protected hand
[1:25:17] hallelujah we have the word of the court
[1:25:20] and what was it
[1:25:21] come out of her my people
[1:25:26] verse 31 34. he says 134 he says
[1:25:29] and god speaks something and that is a
[1:25:33] law
[1:25:37] if god speaks something it's a law
[1:25:43] he said and the holy spirit is here to
[1:25:46] enforce it god somebody
[1:25:49] oh my i'm going to encourage myself
[1:25:51] brother matt
[1:25:52] god says in his word if i bring to his
[1:25:56] storehouse first
[1:25:57] if i pay my tithes and offerings that i
[1:26:00] am blessed and you know what that is a
[1:26:03] law
[1:26:04] and the holy ghost has to enforce it
[1:26:07] amen if i
[1:26:08] am in line with that word hallelujah so
[1:26:12] you know what
[1:26:13] it don't matter what my bank account
[1:26:15] looked like the law
[1:26:16] says i am blessed amen
[1:26:19] amen and everything i need i've already
[1:26:23] got it
[1:26:24] because i'm blessed why
[1:26:27] because i'm spiritually aligned
[1:26:31] wow
[1:26:35] says rebecca you can look at your
[1:26:36] account right now and say
[1:26:38] negative 200 that don't mean nothing
[1:26:42] because god's word is a promise
[1:26:46] he can take away that madness and put a
[1:26:48] plus there at any time
[1:26:50] hardly before you leave service you
[1:26:52] might get a cash out
[1:27:04] because it's a law hell yeah the bible
[1:27:07] said let the weak say i am strong
[1:27:10] that's a law you just got to say it holy
[1:27:12] in matthew 7 chapter he says
[1:27:14] ask hallelujah and what it shall be
[1:27:17] given
[1:27:18] seek and ye shall find knock and the
[1:27:22] door shall be
[1:27:23] opened what is that it's a law
[1:27:28] don't be afraid to ask don't be afraid
[1:27:30] to seek
[1:27:32] don't be afraid to knock it's a law
[1:27:35] just line yourself up he said if you ask
[1:27:38] anything you ask the father anything in
[1:27:41] my name i will do
[1:27:42] it so tonight when you pray pray in the
[1:27:46] name of jesus christ
[1:27:47] line yourself up with that word
[1:27:49] [Applause]
[1:27:52] because the scriptures say anyone that
[1:27:54] asks it receive it
[1:27:57] anyone that seeketh shall find
[1:28:00] anyone that knock it the door shall be
[1:28:03] opened unto them
[1:28:13] oh my i feel encouraged
[1:28:17] he says the holy spirit is here to
[1:28:19] enforce that law
[1:28:21] and then behind it the prophet says amen
[1:28:24] wow for the believer you have to be
[1:28:28] ordained to do so and it takes a
[1:28:30] believer
[1:28:31] you got to have the badge of believer
[1:28:35] somebody says you don't have power no
[1:28:38] but we got
[1:28:38] authority hallelujah that's it not
[1:28:42] power but authority we ain't got enough
[1:28:45] power
[1:28:46] to do nothing what is it we got
[1:28:54] authority
[1:28:56] oh my
[1:28:59] let me move on let me get out y'all way
[1:29:03] listen i want to read this and i'm gonna
[1:29:05] close
[1:29:07] which am i being aligned with god's word
[1:29:10] this way he's coming out the message of
[1:29:13] god proving his word
[1:29:16] somebody say amen god doing what
[1:29:20] proving his word holy
[1:29:23] so what i mean god is basically saying
[1:29:25] whatever i
[1:29:26] said i can prove it god told me
[1:29:29] oh my how many ever had to prove your
[1:29:33] word before
[1:29:35] it's like you go on a job you get hired
[1:29:38] you got to prove that you're able to do
[1:29:40] it
[1:29:41] hallelujah
[1:29:44] listen um
[1:29:49] we're here at um paragraph 85.
[1:29:57] this isn't um i'm proving his word
[1:29:59] listen he says
[1:30:00] but abraham didn't stagger
[1:30:04] anywhere at all of unbelief
[1:30:07] he believed that god was able to perform
[1:30:10] that which he had promised what is the
[1:30:13] promise
[1:30:14] whatever god said in his word
[1:30:18] and we got to believe god is able to do
[1:30:20] any of it
[1:30:22] or let me say all of it
[1:30:25] hallelujah
[1:30:28] he's able to perform that which he
[1:30:29] promised that god will prove his word
[1:30:32] no matter how long it took but instead
[1:30:35] of getting weaker each time
[1:30:37] like we are prone to do he got stronger
[1:30:41] all the time if it didn't happen today
[1:30:43] tomorrow
[1:30:44] it will be a great america how many of
[1:30:46] us think like that
[1:30:49] oh i prayed about this but these didn't
[1:30:51] happen yet you know what he's doing he's
[1:30:53] setting you up for a greater miracle
[1:30:57] hell yeah he said if it didn't happen
[1:31:00] today or tomorrow will be a great
[1:31:01] america
[1:31:02] because it's one day older that was
[1:31:05] that was god that was god and abraham
[1:31:08] for he knowed
[1:31:09] that god proved all his word to be so
[1:31:13] if his children would only take his word
[1:31:16] so he can prove it by you
[1:31:20] how does god prove his word he proved
[1:31:22] this word by you
[1:31:24] holly hallelujah so if you
[1:31:28] get in line with the word god will
[1:31:31] always prove you
[1:31:38] oh my i hope y'all caught that
[1:31:42] he said if his children will only take
[1:31:44] his word so he can prove his word by you
[1:31:47] that's the only way he can prove his
[1:31:49] word
[1:31:50] he doesn't prove it to unbelievers they
[1:31:53] can't be
[1:31:54] proof they are believers but it's not to
[1:31:57] be
[1:31:58] it's not to unbelievers it's not for
[1:32:01] unbelievers
[1:32:02] he said it's to him that believe and if
[1:32:05] he can find something
[1:32:07] who will believe his word he will prove
[1:32:09] his word by you
[1:32:11] and sometimes sickness listen to us now
[1:32:14] and sometimes
[1:32:15] sickness and things happen to us that
[1:32:17] way
[1:32:18] that god can prove himself
[1:32:22] i'll predict i'm going through this i'm
[1:32:24] going to do that god is wanting to prove
[1:32:27] himself
[1:32:32] say oh i got an issue with this god is
[1:32:34] wanting to prove himself
[1:32:36] he will let sickness come so he can
[1:32:38] prove he let kovac come
