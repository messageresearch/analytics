[0:04] 1 Timothy 3:4
[0:08] and5 speaking of an uh overseer and
[0:12] that's uh overseeing the local church
[0:15] says one that ruleth well his own house
[0:18] having his children in subjection with
[0:20] all gravity for if a man know not how to
[0:24] rule his own house how shall he take
[0:26] care of the church of God let's Pray.
[0:29] Heavenly Father, we thank you so much
[0:32] for your word. I pray that this light
[0:34] and this reality, Lord, would come into
[0:36] our hearts, Lord, and would change us
[0:39] and transform us, Lord. That our minds
[0:42] and our hearts would be not conformed to
[0:45] the ways of this world, but would be
[0:47] transformed, Lord, as our as our minds
[0:50] are renewed, Lord, that we would see
[0:53] things through your eyes and through
[0:54] your heart, and we would be changed into
[0:56] the image of Jesus Christ. We ask it in
[0:58] Jesus name. Amen. God bless. You can be
[1:05] seated.
[1:07] So looking at
[1:11] um the
[1:12] ministry um I think many times over the
[1:15] years people look at and see is this
[1:19] person uh gifted to speak? Is he
[1:23] anointed to be able to deal with us? And
[1:26] that's wonderful. But uh scripture never
[1:30] makes how well someone speaks as the
[1:34] qualifications for ministry. And
[1:37] unfortunately, we live, you know, in
[1:38] America where family and everything is
[1:42] divorced from church life, even public
[1:45] life in many ways. And you can you can
[1:47] be a mess and still be a great leader.
[1:52] Uh but really you're not a great leader
[1:55] if if your life is not in order. The
[1:57] scripture makes it clear. If if your
[2:00] life and your family is not in order,
[2:03] how then can you rule or
[2:07] lead the house of God? Amen. And I I
[2:11] think this is a critical point to be
[2:13] made and to be understood. Um, you know,
[2:16] I there's there's we speak a lot about
[2:19] the five-fold ministry, and we look at
[2:21] the gifting that God uses men
[2:24] for, and you could say, well, you know,
[2:27] c some of these ministries, it would be
[2:29] okay if they were not married or if
[2:31] their f family was this or that. But the
[2:34] more I examine it and look at it, I I
[2:36] just can't see any ministry in the body
[2:40] of Christ that would be truly effective
[2:42] if the man is not leading his family
[2:45] well. Now, that doesn't mean there's not
[2:47] problems. We all
[2:48] know we our own selves are full of
[2:51] problems and difficulties and trials,
[2:54] but it's someone that's applying himself
[2:57] and that is getting good results of the
[3:00] Lord moving in his family. It's like
[3:02] saying, "Oh, the man can't lead his
[3:05] children to Christ,
[3:07] so how is he going to lead the people in
[3:10] the church to Christ?" Right? This is
[3:13] this is something that's critical. And I
[3:15] think the way Paul is showing us is that
[3:19] leadership in the in the local church
[3:21] must be done by someone who is leading
[3:24] his own house. Well, you know, we can
[3:27] look at that and see clearly from
[3:29] scripture the the the nature and the
[3:32] attributes. Now in the message basically
[3:35] the only qualification becomes well is
[3:37] your wife uh was your wife a virgin when
[3:39] you were married. This becomes the only
[3:41] qualification when it actually looks
[3:44] more at what is your behavior now? How
[3:47] are you leading your family now? This is
[3:50] the critical portion and the critical
[3:52] part. You know, I look at it. You could
[3:54] say, "Well, what about missionaries and
[3:55] what about this?" It all goes together.
[3:57] If your if your family is in
[4:00] disarray, stop your ministry and go home
[4:04] and that realize that's where your
[4:07] ministry
[4:08] starts because if your ministry isn't
[4:10] getting good results at home, I it's
[4:12] probably not getting the results that
[4:15] it's supposed to get at the church.
[4:19] And I think if if I I believe if we
[4:22] looked at it as believers this way and I
[4:26] would say say it this way, demand
[4:29] more and as ministers demand
[4:32] more of ourselves
[4:35] first. Um this is our first ministry and
[4:39] the pl first place we should be looking
[4:41] for results. Christianity in the world
[4:44] today is full of people that are so
[4:47] focused on their ministry or their
[4:49] life's work, not realizing that your
[4:52] life's work in your legacy is your
[4:56] family. And this is the place where we
[4:59] want to have the first results because
[5:02] we'll eat the fruit of the results that
[5:04] we get.
[5:06] You know, there's there the stories
[5:09] throughout the Christian world are
[5:12] replete in our day and age of men who
[5:14] are great speakers, great orators, and
[5:17] they have no clue how to lead and take
[5:20] care of their families. Well,
[5:22] scripturally, scripturally, you have to
[5:25] say that if they can't lead their
[5:27] families, they should not be in a
[5:29] leadership position in the local church.
[5:33] No matter
[5:34] how gifted a speaker, no matter how
[5:38] anointed or excited people get when he
[5:40] speaks, it's it's more about what are
[5:43] what is the fruit of the ministry. In
[5:45] other words, what kind of lives are his
[5:48] family living? What kind of lives are
[5:51] the people under his care living? Amen.
[5:54] That this scripture connects those two
[5:57] things together and leaves them hand in
[5:59] hand.
[6:02] doesn't mean the man's perfect. It
[6:03] doesn't mean his children are required
[6:05] to be perfect. It does mean though that
[6:08] he is putting all his efforts and and
[6:12] passion into leading his family first
[6:17] and then in turn leading his home. And
[6:20] if if we would if believers would look
[6:23] at that more closely and see that more
[6:25] closely, I think we would have um
[6:28] better, more wellestablished ministers
[6:30] leading us and preaching to
[6:32] us. Might not be a popular s thing to
[6:35] say, but we didn't sign up to be
[6:37] popular.
[6:40] Well, some people might have, but they
[6:43] should get to the altar real quick
[6:45] because if we're preaching to be popular
[6:48] and to get likes and
[7:05] attend, preside over, to be a protector
[7:08] or guardian to give aid to to care for
[7:12] give attention to. So a dis a preacher
[7:16] who's disconnected from his family is
[7:20] disqualified from the ministry. Let's
[7:23] just be blunt about it. Let's just be
[7:26] straight about it. If you're not paying
[7:28] attention to it, if you're not being a
[7:30] protector, not a guardian, you're not
[7:32] superintending, you're not leading them,
[7:34] you're not first teaching them, then
[7:38] you're disqualifying yourself from the
[7:40] ministry.
[7:44] 1 Peter 5:1 and2, "The elders who are
[7:48] among you, I exhort, I who am a fellow
[7:51] elder and a witness of the sufferings of
[7:53] Christ, and also a partaker of the glory
[7:57] that will be
[7:58] revealed. Shepherd the flock of God,
[8:00] which is among you, serving as
[8:02] overseers, not by compulsion, but
[8:05] willingly, not for in dishonest gain,
[8:09] but eagerly."
[8:12] So here Peter writing to them is
[8:15] is expounding on what the work of
[8:19] someone who's ordained to be a shepherd
[8:21] or an overseer of the church. And it's
[8:26] the purpose is if we look at another
[8:29] translation it's to feed the flock of
[8:31] God. So the oversight that's taken is
[8:34] feeding them. So as fathers then we
[8:38] understand that it's our duty
[8:41] to spiritually feed our
[8:43] families. Many times we look at it as
[8:46] well we just get them to church. We make
[8:47] sure they're fed and clothed. But
[8:49] actually your duty is to be a teacher of
[8:53] your family.
[8:55] If you for if you forgot the scriptures
[8:56] that we covered about four different
[8:58] times, it's Ephesians 6:4.
[9:02] We're supposed to to admonish to raise
[9:05] our children in the in the in the
[9:08] admonition and the correction of the
[9:11] Lord. And this is this is our
[9:14] duty. Too often we see it our our well,
[9:17] let's just put it this way. Our the
[9:19] culture around
[9:21] us takes us and causes us to put these
[9:25] our our duties onto someone else.
[9:30] And we don't examine that it's actually
[9:32] our own duty. We come and say the church
[9:36] isn't doing this. The church isn't
[9:37] providing this. The pastor should preach
[9:40] more about this. The pastor should do
[9:42] about that. And forget that you are the
[9:44] pastor of your own flock. You are the
[9:45] shepherd of your family. And you can't
[9:49] put all the responsibility onto someone
[9:51] else to do what God has called you to
[9:54] do.
[9:57] And so part of that is spiritually
[10:00] feeding your family. You say, "My family
[10:02] isn't getting enough this. They need
[10:03] this. Why isn't the preacher preaching
[10:05] about
[10:07] this? You the the Holy Spirit has caused
[10:10] you to notice something that's needed."
[10:13] Now get on your knees and get in your
[10:15] Bible and start studying and start
[10:18] seeking after God. And you bring it to
[10:20] your family what they have need of. You
[10:23] say, "I I can't. I you
[10:26] can if you do this daily. Really, it
[10:30] should be daily that you're feeding your
[10:32] family. Not once in every not when it's
[10:35] emergency. We don't wait till an
[10:37] emergency. We don't wait till
[10:38] everybody's starving to feed them
[10:40] dinner. We just do it regularly.
[10:44] And so that same thing goes with
[10:45] spiritually feeding our families as
[10:49] fathers. You know, we mention it in
[10:52] passing. You're the high priest of your
[10:54] home.
[10:56] Well, seems pretty consuming to
[10:59] me. Seems like it's something that
[11:02] should be like a focus for fathers, not
[11:05] a side thing. Well, we go to church and
[11:07] I send them to school and we do
[11:09] homeschooling at home and my wife does
[11:11] this
[11:13] and is that where we're
[11:15] at? We're putting our own responsibility
[11:19] on to other people instead of being men
[11:21] and taking responsibility for what our
[11:24] duty and what our job
[11:26] is. We we have to feed the flock that's
[11:31] in front of us that God has given us the
[11:33] oversight. And if we do a good job of
[11:35] that, you're gifted at doing that, then
[11:39] you qualify to feed and rule over the
[11:42] church of God. But if you don't do that
[11:45] and you neglect that, then you're
[11:48] neglecting your primary
[11:53] duty. The the the the great deception of
[11:57] the modern church is that a man's first
[12:01] and primary calling is outside of his
[12:05] home. Not realizing that it's his own
[12:08] wife and children. Amen. That's the
[12:11] first duty and calling. Yes, there's
[12:14] many things that need to be done outside
[12:16] the home, but that's not first
[12:19] place. That's comes after the fam. God
[12:22] first, family second, everything else
[12:25] after that. Church doesn't come before
[12:28] family. Sorry, you might disagree with
[12:31] me. You might want to slap me upside the
[12:34] head, but family, you have to put
[12:37] feeding your own family ahead of the
[12:41] church. Amen.
[12:46] 1 Thessalonians 2:10, Paul speaking
[12:49] about his attribute as a father to the
[12:53] people that he was uh leading to Christ.
[12:55] He says, "You are witnesses and God also
[12:58] how holy and justly and unblamably
[13:01] unblamably we behaved ourselves among
[13:03] you that believe. as you you know how we
[13:07] exhorted and comforted and charged every
[13:09] one of you as a father doth his
[13:13] children.
[13:15] So fathers do you exhort and comfort and
[13:20] charge your children? Paul says this is
[13:24] uh a main attribute that fathers are
[13:27] supposed to have in their life is to
[13:30] exhort your children, comfort them. The
[13:33] word charged speaks of uh being a
[13:37] witness. It's literally the word martyr.
[13:39] So it's being a witness. So testifying
[13:42] to them of what God has done in your
[13:44] life, witnessing to them of the gospel.
[13:47] This is a primary duty of fathers. Amen.
[13:52] The first people that the children
[13:54] should hear the gospel from, it's not in
[13:56] church. It's from mom and dad. Amen. And
[14:00] as we need to hear the gospel every
[14:02] single day, probably 20 times a day
[14:06] personally, we should be doing the same
[14:08] thing for our own
[14:11] family. First Samuel 3.
[14:17] Old Eli, he was a godly
[14:23] man, but poor old
[14:25] Eli didn't discharge fully his duty as a
[14:30] father. Amen.
[14:34] And the Lord said to Samuel, "Behold, I
[14:36] will do a thing in Israel at which both
[14:37] the ears of everyone that heareth it
[14:40] shall tingle. In that day I will perform
[14:43] against Eli all things which I have
[14:45] spoken concerning his house. When I
[14:47] begin, I will also make an end. For I
[14:50] have told him that I will judge his
[14:52] house forever, for the iniquity which he
[14:54] knoweth, because his sons made
[14:56] themselves vile, and he restrained them
[15:00] not. And therefore I have sworn unto the
[15:03] house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's
[15:05] house shall not be purged with
[15:07] sacrifice, nor offering forever.
[15:11] So what did Eli was a godly man. He was
[15:15] a godly high priest. He loved the people
[15:18] and he performed his ministry well. But
[15:21] he missed something. And that's when his
[15:24] sons did evil. He refused to correct
[15:27] them. He refused to do what he was
[15:30] supposed to do as a
[15:32] father. What should what could he have
[15:35] done? His sons were doing this. Well,
[15:36] number one is kick them out of the
[15:38] ministry. Amen.
[15:40] you guys are disqualified. You're
[15:42] behaving like thieves and perverts. You
[15:46] can no longer do the ministry. But he
[15:48] refused to do
[15:51] that. Even in the situation where he
[15:53] gets this prophecy from Samuel, did he
[15:56] take them out of the ministry? Did he do
[15:58] anything? He said, "Well, that's what
[16:00] the Lord wants to do. It's fine."
[16:04] What a shame. Amen. What a reproach.
[16:07] What a milk toast.
[16:10] He might have been ever so strong in his
[16:12] mental beliefs, but when when it came
[16:15] down to doing what he had to do with his
[16:18] sons, number one is why did they get so
[16:20] far along that they thought that they
[16:21] could behave like this? If their father
[16:23] was involved and raising them the way he
[16:26] was supposed to, they would have been
[16:28] getting a good dose of correction for
[16:30] their misbehavior when they were little.
[16:32] Amen. And this would have brought a
[16:35] change to them. But instead it brought
[16:37] God he refused to restrain
[16:39] them and it brought God's wrath upon his
[16:43] house. And really if you if you
[16:46] understand it is that's what that's what
[16:48] many times happen is you refuse to do
[16:50] your duty as a father and it brings
[16:53] God's judgment and displeasure upon your
[16:56] family and then you reap what you have
[16:59] sown for what it for what has happened
[17:02] and it's heartbreaking and it's
[17:05] difficult and yet we know that God is a
[17:07] redeemer.
[17:09] God is gracious. Even when we fail, even
[17:12] when we make mistakes, you know, don't
[17:15] do as Eli and just say, "Well, so be it.
[17:18] It's too late now." Which is just going
[17:21] to happen. When when God reveals
[17:23] something to you, does it matter when it
[17:25] is? You first correct yourself, then
[17:28] then bring it to your family. You say,
[17:31] "It's too late." No, not with God.
[17:36] So correct yourself and then bring your
[17:39] apology for your failure to your family.
[17:41] I've had to do it myself. Amen.
[17:45] It's necess it's absolutely necessary.
[17:48] Don't don't just say, "Well, it is what
[17:50] it is. Nothing we can do now." It's not
[17:54] true.
[17:56] You have you have prayer and you have
[17:59] words that you can speak. And those
[18:02] words, if they're the word of God, if
[18:04] they're the oracles of God, they're
[18:06] powerful to bring a change and
[18:12] transformation. Proverbs 22 verse
[18:16] 6, train up a child in the way he should
[18:19] go, and when he is old, he will not
[18:21] depart depart from it. Obviously, this
[18:24] is verse everybody's heard over and over
[18:26] and over again, but it it it goes again.
[18:29] How do I do that? You take the word of
[18:32] God that God is showing you and you show
[18:36] it to your family. Just as Abraham, as
[18:39] we talked about last time, just like
[18:42] just like
[18:43] Abraham, should I hide from Abraham the
[18:46] thing that I'm about to do to Sodom and
[18:48] Gomorrah, seeing I can't do it, seeing
[18:51] that he will command his family after
[18:53] him to know the Lord and to do justice.
[18:57] And so because Abraham was a man of God
[19:01] that was going to instruct his family,
[19:04] God revealed the secrets to him. So
[19:06] start teaching your family what God has
[19:08] shown
[19:09] you and more is
[19:12] coming. God will reveal more and more
[19:15] and more to you to bring to your family.
[19:18] Don't leave it as my kids just man they
[19:20] just don't know the message very well.
[19:24] Okay. Well, look in the
[19:27] mirror. It's because of
[19:31] you. Sorry to be I apologize for being
[19:34] so blunt this morning, but I'm talking
[19:36] to myself as well. And as I said before,
[19:40] it's not too late. You say, "Oh, it's
[19:42] too late. They're this age." Well, if
[19:45] you feel that
[19:47] way, so be
[19:49] it. But maybe God can use you even now.
[19:54] Maybe God can work through you even now.
[19:56] I believe he
[19:58] can. And so, but the critical thing is
[20:01] if you don't have kids yet, pay
[20:02] attention to this this verse. Or if you
[20:05] have little babies, pay attention to
[20:07] this verse. Start
[20:09] immediately.
[20:11] Fathers, if you're if or husbands or
[20:15] soon to be husbands,
[20:17] um, understand, lead your home right
[20:20] away. Don't even wait till you have
[20:22] children. Lead your wife in worship.
[20:25] Teach your wife. It should be a
[20:28] wellestablished thing that's happening
[20:30] in your home so that when kids enter
[20:31] enter into it, they're infants and it's
[20:34] happening and it's just all they know.
[20:36] What a glorious thing. Start that
[20:39] immediately. And of course, we know that
[20:41] there's exceptions. This is a proverb.
[20:44] It's not an absolute that you train up
[20:47] the child in the way they should go.
[20:48] When they're old, they will not depart
[20:50] from it. Sometimes they do depart from
[20:52] it and sometimes they depart from it
[20:55] permanently. But the general principle
[20:57] is this is if you do train them up in
[20:59] the good and right ways of God with love
[21:02] and with correction and with all the
[21:04] balance of the word of God, then when
[21:07] they're old, it's quite difficult to
[21:08] depart from such a good and lovely and
[21:11] beautiful way. Right? That's the point
[21:14] that it's going to make. with
[21:16] difficulty. Many kids, young people can
[21:20] leave leave the ways that they've been
[21:21] trained in. It's it's a fact. But it's
[21:24] not easy. Amen. It's not easy to do
[21:27] it. Proverbs
[21:31] 13:24. He that spareth his rod hateth
[21:35] his son, but he that loveth him
[21:38] chastineth him be times.
[21:41] You know, you look at it and and many
[21:43] people and of course young people feel
[21:45] that if their father was a little bit
[21:47] more like Eli, they would be
[21:51] happy. He lets me. My dad just lets me
[21:54] do whatever I want to do.
[21:56] Well, you're being ruined.
[21:59] Amen.
[22:02] And just want to look at what John Gil
[22:05] writes about it. I thought it was
[22:06] wonderful. He says, "He who withholds
[22:09] and or withdraws his rod of correction
[22:11] was in which is in his hand which he has
[22:13] power to use and ought to exercise at
[22:16] proper times. He instead of loving his
[22:18] son may be said to hate him. For such
[22:21] fond love is no better than hatred. And
[22:23] if he really hated him, he could
[22:24] scarcely do a more ill thing by him than
[22:27] not to correct him for a fault, which
[22:29] was the sin of good old Eli. And both he
[22:32] and his sons suffered for it. But he
[22:36] that loveth him that has a true love for
[22:38] his son, a hearty concern for his
[22:40] welfare and future good, he will
[22:42] regulate his affections by his judgment,
[22:44] and not give way to a fond passion to
[22:47] the prejudice of his child. But he
[22:51] chasenneth him be times. or in the
[22:53] morning in the morning of his infancy
[22:55] before vicious habits are contracted or
[22:58] he is accustomed to sinning and hardened
[23:00] in it or as soon as a crime is
[23:03] perpetrated before it is forgot or
[23:05] repeated or every morning as Jaryie and
[23:07] Aban Ezra that is continually as often
[23:10] as it is
[23:11] necessary or as faults are
[23:15] committed. Proverbs
[23:17] 23:13, "Withhold not correction from the
[23:20] child, for if thou beatest him with the
[23:22] rod, he shall not die. Thou shalt beat
[23:26] him with the rod and shall deliver his
[23:29] soul from
[23:31] hell." I guess it's very important to
[23:34] understand some some principles behind
[23:36] this. I have a few quotes from brother
[23:38] Brandham, but I think uh for the sake of
[23:41] time, I'll I'll do that another time.
[23:45] um biblical principles that we follow in
[23:48] correcting our children. Number one is
[23:52] uh an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
[23:54] tooth. In other words, the punishment
[23:57] should be commensurate to the crime. In
[24:00] other words, it needs to be just. It's
[24:02] not just flying off the handle and
[24:05] spanking them 40, you know, uh 39
[24:10] times because they took a piece of candy
[24:13] that you told them not to take. It's let
[24:15] let the punishment be commensurate to
[24:17] what they've done. You know, sit down
[24:20] and logically think out what the what
[24:22] the punishment should be before it's
[24:24] happened. That's what we do in
[24:27] government. It's also what we should do
[24:29] as parents is that they understand the
[24:31] consequences for the actions, you know,
[24:34] before they they reap the consequences.
[24:38] Number two is the wrath of man works not
[24:40] the righteousness of God. So correction
[24:43] should never be done in anger but with
[24:46] love, wisdom and careful thought. Number
[24:51] three, biblical instruction to them
[24:55] should be what the basis is of the
[24:58] correction. In other words, there should
[25:00] be teaching along with the the spanking
[25:04] that's going on.
[25:06] take the time to show them in the
[25:07] scripture about lying or about fighting
[25:09] or about stealing or about fits of anger
[25:12] etc etc. Wouldn't be a great thing if
[25:15] they are throwing a fit of anger for you
[25:17] to then throw a fit of anger and take a
[25:20] rod and correct them in the midst of
[25:22] that. You would be just reinforcing that
[25:24] fits of anger are
[25:26] normal. Take your time, be slow about it
[25:30] and use wisdom. Number four, the
[25:32] correction should result in restoring
[25:36] fellowship. It's not spank them in anger
[25:38] and then throw them throw them off and
[25:40] push them away from you.
[25:42] It's spanking them and then explaining
[25:46] them, comforting them, hugging them and
[25:49] restoring the fellowship whether it's
[25:50] between siblings or whether it's between
[25:53] uh par uh uh par the parent and the
[25:57] child whatever it might be. and then
[25:59] make sure that it is the parent that
[26:01] corrected is also the one that's giving
[26:04] comfort. These are godly uh principles
[26:07] from the scriptures. You know, brother
[26:10] Bham speaks in a couple different
[26:13] instances about the importance
[26:16] of using the rod of correction with your
[26:19] children. And he and he he says in
[26:22] multiple places, I just one of one of
[26:24] the quotes is quite lengthy. I I I wish
[26:27] I could read it now, but
[26:29] um just the general point that he he his
[26:35] his dad would take out the ramrod from
[26:38] his musket and whip him across the rear
[26:40] end with it. But his dad wouldn't do it
[26:42] right away. He said so many times he
[26:44] would say, "Tomorrow you're going to get
[26:45] it." Please, Dad, can it be now? And he
[26:48] would say, "Tomorrow." So, it's a good
[26:51] principle. Wait. Calm down. Don't do it
[26:54] in anger. Amen. Give it give it time.
[26:57] And he
[26:59] says, Brother Brandham says, "I deserved
[27:01] every one of the spankings that that my
[27:03] dad gave to me." And I I thank him. He
[27:06] said, "In fact, I deserved a lot more
[27:08] than than what I actually got." In other
[27:11] places, he he talks about
[27:15] um well, I'll just read
[27:19] that in the sermon. He hear ye him,
[27:21] Brother Brandham says, and you could see
[27:22] this. He mentions this uh in this way a
[27:26] few different times. Says, "And you come
[27:28] out and find Christian women laying out
[27:29] on the beach to get a tan." Well, I got
[27:32] two girls here tonight. I don't know
[27:33] what the future holds, but if I ever
[27:35] catch one of them when she's a young
[27:36] woman, of course, he's speaking about
[27:38] laying out in a bikini in in public on
[27:41] the beach, laying out on a beach to get
[27:42] a tan. She'll get a tanning. All right.
[27:44] It won't be from the sun. It'll be from
[27:46] Charles Brham's son with a barrel slat
[27:48] in his hand, bringing her home, making
[27:50] her jump every
[27:53] time. And so you see there the the need
[27:57] for
[27:58] correction. And of course, you
[28:00] understand that there's a balance just
[28:03] why we went through the biblical
[28:04] principles in all this of of our
[28:07] attitude, how to approach it, and
[28:09] understand that it's part of teaching.
[28:12] It isn't just a way for us to vent anger
[28:14] on our children. Um, it is a teaching
[28:19] tool to help them to understand. And
[28:22] it's a it's a biblical principle. In
[28:24] America, we feel like we are so
[28:26] revelated beyond biblical principles.
[28:28] But we need to slow down and settle down
[28:32] and realize that the God of the
[28:34] universe who spoke everything into
[28:36] existence, who governs everything on the
[28:38] planet, also gave us this
[28:41] word and he spoke it. And it's his
[28:43] principle in his scripture. And if we
[28:47] want our children to to be raised up
[28:49] right, we should follow what the word of
[28:51] God says. Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly
[28:55] Father, we thank you so much for your
[28:56] word, Lord. Amen. Truly, it's it's a
[29:00] light in a dark place. Lord, I pray that
[29:04] you would guide us and lead us and teach
[29:07] us in all this thing all these things.
[29:09] Lord, I realize that
[29:12] uh a man can or a woman can read the
[29:15] Bible and try to apply its principles,
[29:17] but without the Holy Spirit will get the
[29:21] balance of it wrong every time. Lord,
[29:24] give us your heart and your mind as as
[29:28] parents, as grandparents, even as young
[29:30] people in preparation. Lord, mold us and
[29:33] shape us into the image of Jesus Christ.
[29:35] We ask it in his lovely name, the Lord
[29:38] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
