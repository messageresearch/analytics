[0:00] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you,
[0:03] saints. So glad to be in the house of
[0:05] the Lord this morning. Amen. If you want
[0:08] to go ahead and bring up the PowerPoint,
[0:10] we'll get right to the word. There's a
[0:12] lot of people obviously out of town for
[0:15] uh brother Caleb and Sister Julia's
[0:17] wedding that's going to happen tomorrow.
[0:20] Um
[0:21] and so just pray for everyone that's
[0:24] going to be that has traveled, is
[0:26] traveling, will travel tomorrow. So,
[0:28] amen. God is good. I'm going to speak on
[0:33] the seventh seal, the mystery of hidden
[0:36] wisdom. And I'm just putting part one on
[0:38] there because I know there's there's no
[0:40] way I will get through my notes today.
[0:45] So, let's turn in the scriptures to
[0:46] Revelation
[0:48] chapter 8 and verse one.
[0:57] Amen. And when he had opened the seventh
[0:59] seal, there was silence in heaven about
[1:02] the space of half an hour. Let's pray.
[1:05] Heavenly Father, we just come before you
[1:07] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:08] Lord, we ask that you would anoint your
[1:10] word. Lord, anoint your servants this
[1:13] morning. Lord, speak to our hearts,
[1:15] Father, in a supernatural way. I just
[1:17] want to lay myself aside, Lord. I'm
[1:19] yours. I ask that you just speak words
[1:22] of life through me this morning, Lord.
[1:25] That it would come like a revelation to
[1:28] every heart for your glory. We ask it in
[1:30] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Can be
[1:33] seated.
[1:38] So, as we look at this verse, uh, so
[1:42] frequently
[1:44] we just take it. I I just take it. It's
[1:46] It's not just you. It's me, too. We take
[1:49] it by itself and then we as as is so
[1:54] fitting we take it directly to
[1:56] Revelation 10. The seventh seal is just
[1:59] one verse speaking of the silence. And
[2:02] we understand it's speaking of the
[2:04] coming of the Lord, the revealing of the
[2:06] son of man. In other words, and it's
[2:09] speaking of the mighty angel coming
[2:12] down, uttering his voice, seven th when
[2:15] he utters his voice, seven thunders out
[2:17] of their voices because there's an open
[2:19] book revealing the mysteries that's in
[2:21] that open book. And then at that time
[2:25] the seventh church age messenger brings
[2:28] his message to finish the mystery of
[2:32] God. And of course that all that is
[2:35] absolutely true but there's other verses
[2:37] right after this
[2:40] and I want to look at it because
[2:42] personally I've always taken this and
[2:44] you see the next verse and you say this
[2:45] is the seven trumpets. That's that's all
[2:47] there is to it. But that's introducing
[2:49] the seven trumpets. the next few verses,
[2:51] as we'll see, there's more to the scene
[2:54] of the seventh seal than just verse one.
[2:59] And this amazed me when I saw it
[3:02] yesterday afternoon.
[3:05] Now, the seal again, we had the picture
[3:09] up on the first one is each seal holds a
[3:13] portion of the scroll. You open one, one
[3:16] portion opens, you open another as you
[3:18] go along and then the seventh until the
[3:21] seventh seal is opened, you cannot fully
[3:23] open the book and access to all its
[3:27] context. So when all the seven seals are
[3:30] opened, now we can say it's an open
[3:32] book. It's only partially opened when
[3:35] the first, second, third, fourth, fifth,
[3:37] and sixth. But once the seventh is
[3:40] opened now, we have access to
[3:44] everything. Everything is unsealed.
[3:46] And when that happens, what what what
[3:49] what's the result? There's a silence.
[3:51] There's a hush. There's an amazement.
[3:52] There's a reverence. There's an awe
[3:55] that's taking the the the greatest
[3:57] created beings are silent. The four the
[4:00] four creatures, living creatures or the
[4:02] four beasts there around the throne
[4:05] guarding the throne, they're silent. The
[4:07] 24 elders are silent. The saints are
[4:10] also everyone is silent around the
[4:13] throne. When this is opened, the book of
[4:16] redemption is now completely opened and
[4:20] they go silent. All right, let's look at
[4:23] a few quotes from the seventh seal.
[4:27] Uh when we compared the scripture here
[4:29] with Matthew 24 with the six seals, the
[4:32] seventh seal was left out because you
[4:34] see Christ said only God himself know
[4:36] not even the angels. No wonder it wasn't
[4:38] even written. You see they hushed
[4:40] nothing take place then angels don't
[4:43] know about it. Nobody knows when he is
[4:46] coming.
[4:47] But there will be seven voices of these
[4:51] thunders that will reveal the great
[4:52] revelation at that time. So I believe to
[4:56] us if we don't know it and if we it
[4:57] won't be known till that time but it
[5:00] will be revealed in that day in the hour
[5:02] that it's supposed to be revealed in. So
[5:04] the thing for us to do is to be reverent
[5:07] before God and serve him and do all that
[5:09] we know how to do and live good
[5:11] Christian lives. Here now we find that
[5:13] the sixth seal has been open to us. We
[5:15] see it and we know that this seventh
[5:17] seal cannot be broke to the public until
[5:21] that hour arrive. Now, there was some
[5:23] reason that God let these the seven
[5:25] voices be thundered because it must
[5:27] come. See, we find that Christ the Lamb
[5:30] took the book in his hand and he opened
[5:32] that seventh seal. But you see, it's a
[5:34] hidden mystery. No one knows it. But
[5:37] it's right along with what he said. No
[5:39] one would know his coming. They also
[5:42] would not know about this seven thunder
[5:45] mystery. So, you see, it's connected
[5:47] together. that much we have an
[5:49] understanding of it today because the
[5:51] rest of it is all unfolded but this is
[5:54] not unfolded but sitting in my room I
[5:56] heard this or not heard rather but seen
[5:58] it unfold to this seven thunders now
[6:01] that's as far as we can go right there
[6:04] and now I trust that each and every one
[6:06] of you will serve God and do that which
[6:08] is right and love him all your life and
[6:11] serve him and God will take care of the
[6:13] rest now we have in the completion here
[6:15] now by the grace of God all the mystery
[6:17] of the six seals that's been sealed up
[6:20] and we understand and know here that the
[6:22] seventh seal is not to be known to the
[6:25] public.
[6:26] Now his coming at the hour of his coming
[6:28] when the destruction of the earth you
[6:30] know he said there that what will be the
[6:31] sign of the coming of the end of the
[6:33] world in Matthew 24 there where they
[6:35] asked him that question he went down to
[6:37] that he told told about Israel being
[6:39] gathered as a nation in the 31st verse
[6:42] Matthew 24:31
[6:45] but then he started off in parables see
[6:47] then you see learn a parable of the fig
[6:49] tree when you see us putting forth its
[6:51] buds why you know spring is nigh then
[6:52] when you see this coming to pass then
[6:55] know that the time is n see Israel
[6:57] gathering in its own homeland. But you
[6:59] notice he omitted the revelation of the
[7:02] seventh seal. And here when the seventh
[7:06] seal when he opened it, he also omitted
[7:08] it again. See, so we see that it is a
[7:10] complete mystery. Therefore, the hour is
[7:12] not yet for the mystery to be known.
[7:15] Therefore, we're this far and the rest
[7:17] of it will be known right around about
[7:20] this time that Jesus appears on the
[7:23] earth for his bride or whatever takes
[7:25] place at that time. Now, until that
[7:27] time, let's just all pray, live good,
[7:30] straight Christian lives looking forward
[7:33] to his coming. Amen.
[7:37] Now as we read this we we have to
[7:40] understand you cannot dislocate
[7:44] this from the rest of the message. You
[7:46] cannot take the seventh seal and say
[7:49] well that's it. Seventh seal is not
[7:52] revealed. Brother Brandham says nothing
[7:53] else about it. He says a lot more about
[7:55] it. They asked him if the if the seven
[7:58] thunders is not yet known or if the
[8:00] seventh seal is known. He said that's
[8:01] what the message is all about.
[8:04] In in in the church ages book, what does
[8:07] he say? That that seventh church age
[8:09] messenger does two things. He turns the
[8:12] hearts of the children back to the
[8:13] Pentecostal father's faith and he
[8:15] reveals the mystery of the seven
[8:18] thunders. And it's the mystery truth
[8:20] reveed in those seven thunders that
[8:23] actually is what restores us back to the
[8:26] original faith. So when we're looking at
[8:29] it, what is the the what did the seven
[8:33] thunders speak in heaven? What did they
[8:36] speak? Well, only person can tell that
[8:40] would be the seventh angel of Revelation
[8:42] 10:7. He's the one that has to reveal to
[8:45] us what they said because it wasn't
[8:47] uttered to us.
[8:51] What's uttered to us is the voice of the
[8:53] seventh angel. God doesn't speak to his
[8:56] church as a whole through angelic
[8:59] beings, spiritual angelic beings. He
[9:01] uses natural angels because in the Bible
[9:04] based on the context we understand it
[9:06] either can be a human messenger or it
[9:09] can be a spiritual messenger what we
[9:13] call an angel. But angel is angalos and
[9:17] a human certainly can be an angel.
[9:21] Amen.
[9:24] There's spiritual beings who are angels
[9:26] and there's natural beings who are
[9:28] angels. If you have if you carry a
[9:29] message from God to his church that
[9:33] doesn't come from a spiritual angel. We
[9:36] can't find anywhere in scripture where
[9:38] an entire church receives a revelation
[9:41] from a spiritual angel or the children
[9:44] of Israel. The first time that God came
[9:46] down to speak to the nation, they said,
[9:48] "Stop.
[9:50] Don't do that. We're all going to die.
[9:52] So he says they've spoken right. I'll
[9:54] raise up a prophet. So that's how God is
[9:57] going to speak to his people. So we come
[10:00] to this seventh seal. It is a mystery.
[10:02] The third part of it is in mystery form.
[10:06] We he said we know the first two parts.
[10:08] The third part is a mystery. It's tied
[10:11] to what? The coming of the Lord and the
[10:13] seven thunders. So brother Brandham's
[10:15] purpose when he preached the seventh
[10:16] seal is to understand it's a mystery.
[10:20] The six seals all give us information,
[10:22] right, about God's plan, God's purposes,
[10:25] what he has done, what he is doing, what
[10:28] he will do. But the seventh seal is
[10:30] what?
[10:32] Think about think about this for a
[10:33] second. What is what was when Ruth
[10:37] received her promise, what did she
[10:40] receive? Six measures of barley.
[10:45] Why not seven? Because the seventh
[10:47] inheritance which she was to have was
[10:49] Boaz, a person. So what is the seventh
[10:52] seal? It's revealing a person. It's a
[10:55] revelation of Christ. It's in mystery
[10:57] format. I cannot I can I can try to
[11:00] preach everything to you about Christ.
[11:02] And we we ought to make it plain by the
[11:04] scriptures. I can try to tell show you
[11:06] the Godhead. I can try to show you the
[11:08] de the details about who he is. But the
[11:11] the the real reality is that God doesn't
[11:14] want us to know facts about him. God
[11:16] wants us to know him by supernatural
[11:19] revelation personally in our heart so
[11:21] that we really have fellowship with him.
[11:23] Not a make believe, not a pretend, but a
[11:27] real transforming power of revelation.
[11:30] It's no mistake that brother Brandham
[11:32] says, don't try to interpret this. Live
[11:35] a godly Christian life. What is the
[11:37] interpretation of the seventh seal?
[11:39] Christ in you, the hope of glory. You
[11:42] living the life of Christ in this hour
[11:45] is the interpretation of the seventh
[11:47] seal.
[11:49] I went all the way to the end
[11:51] right at the beginning. Uh 1 Corinthians
[11:56] chapter 2. This is the area where I uh
[12:00] took my title from. And I want to go
[12:04] through all of chapter 2.
[12:08] I feel like it's important to see the
[12:11] full context here
[12:13] because because it gives in the
[12:15] scripture there's a there's a balance.
[12:18] We can try to go off and and and go one
[12:20] direction into the Pentecostal side. We
[12:22] can try to go off into the revel
[12:24] revelatory side, but the scripture
[12:26] doesn't present it in these imbalanced
[12:28] ways. It gives us the balanced truth
[12:31] right down the middle. He says, 'And I,
[12:33] brethren, when I came to you, came not
[12:35] with excellency of speech or of wisdom,
[12:38] declaring unto you the testimony of God.
[12:40] So this is Paul speaking about how he
[12:43] what was his initial approach to the
[12:46] Corinthians. When I came to you, I
[12:48] wasn't trying to use excellent speech. I
[12:52] wasn't trying to bring wisdom to you. I
[12:54] was simply declaring you the testimony
[12:57] of God. For I determined not to know
[13:00] anything among you, save Jesus Christ
[13:03] and him crucified. Amen.
[13:08] And I was with you in weakness and in
[13:10] fear and in much trembling.
[13:14] And my speech and my preaching was not
[13:16] with enticing words of man's wisdom.
[13:20] What was it in then, Paul? But in
[13:22] demonstrration of the spirit and of
[13:25] power. Again, he's not denying that he
[13:29] had speech and preaching. He had speech
[13:32] and preaching, but his approach, he was
[13:34] not preaching to them. They're ignorant.
[13:38] They're pagans. His initial approach
[13:40] wasn't, I'm going to show you uh the the
[13:43] mysteries of predestination.
[13:46] It means nothing to them. You must be
[13:48] first receive the Holy Ghost and be
[13:50] converted. Then the Holy Ghost leads you
[13:53] into all truth. So, he comes what? With
[13:55] the gospel. Jesus died. This was
[13:58] promised in the word. It was prophesied
[14:02] uh hundreds of years ago. It's come to
[14:05] pass. And God has raised him from the
[14:07] dead just like the scripture says. See,
[14:10] that's what his preaching was. But it
[14:12] wasn't just with that. It wasn't just
[14:14] outward words. He came and said Jesus is
[14:18] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[14:20] He's still a healer. He promised to us
[14:23] that the signs would follow the word.
[14:26] And so the signs followed the word that
[14:28] Paul preached. He laid his hands on the
[14:31] sick. They recovered. Many times he just
[14:33] spoke the word. You sir, I see you have
[14:35] faith. Get up.
[14:38] And so that's how the gospel comes. It
[14:41] must come this way and it must continue
[14:43] this way. The power of God is attached
[14:47] to the true preaching of the word. If
[14:50] there's no power behind it, we can see
[14:52] that there's a problem.
[14:55] We should examine what's what's what's
[14:57] the issue here? Why why isn't there the
[15:00] supernatural power accompanying the word
[15:02] that's being preached? First of all, it
[15:04] should bring transformation in people's
[15:06] lives. Second of all, signs should be
[15:08] following.
[15:12] 1 Corinthians 2 verse 5, that your faith
[15:15] should not stand in the wisdom of men,
[15:17] but in the power of God. See, that's
[15:20] what Paul was presenting to them. not
[15:23] merely
[15:24] words of a man, but he was presenting to
[15:28] them the power of God. He was showing
[15:29] them this Jesus is alive and here and
[15:34] manifesting himself right now amongst
[15:36] you. You can see him. He's manifested.
[15:39] This is Jesus. This isn't Paul. This is
[15:42] the words of Jesus coming through the
[15:45] body of Christ.
[15:47] And so that their faith would not be in
[15:49] Paul. See, there's a great danger. Can
[15:51] that happen? Absolutely. People's faith
[15:54] could be in the messenger instead of in
[15:58] the power of God. Now, here Paul was
[16:01] laboring to make sure that they knew
[16:04] that this was Jesus Christ on display.
[16:07] How be it? How be it? However, so again,
[16:10] it's important to finish the scripture.
[16:14] If we just stay with one through five,
[16:16] we say we don't need the mysteries of
[16:18] the word. We don't need to understand
[16:20] the scripture. We don't need to
[16:22] understand the mysteries that God
[16:24] brought through the prophet. Well, then
[16:25] why did he bring him in the first place?
[16:29] Just
[16:31] just to say he did. No, he came to bring
[16:34] us an understanding. Listen to the
[16:36] sermon paradox. He says it has to come
[16:40] in Ephesians again. Why? Because there
[16:42] he he's come to bring us an
[16:44] understanding.
[16:46] not just an understanding for the sake
[16:48] of an understanding, but that we would
[16:50] know him and the power of his
[16:51] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[16:53] sufferings. So he did he says, "How be
[16:56] it, however, we do speak wisdom among
[16:58] them that are perfect, not sinless. Is
[17:02] that what it's speaking of? It's
[17:04] speaking of mature.
[17:06] Those who have matured in the word, we
[17:09] do speak wisdom to them." So he's not
[17:11] he's not saying, you know, I just preach
[17:15] uh the simplicity of the gospel. That's
[17:18] what it seems like he's starting to say.
[17:20] I determined when I came to you, I
[17:22] determined to not know anything but the
[17:24] simplicity of the gospel. However,
[17:27] for those who are mature, I do speak
[17:30] wisdom.
[17:31] Yet, it's not the wisdom of the world,
[17:34] nor of the princes of this world that
[17:36] come to nothing.
[17:39] And Paul's going to talk to us about how
[17:41] this comes. It's not by the flesh. It's
[17:45] not after man's knowledge.
[17:49] But we speak the wisdom of God in a
[17:53] mystery. Amen. Now if if you if you look
[17:58] and study uh world religions and cults,
[18:03] they always present it as a mystery
[18:05] because they believe it is hidden and
[18:08] should remain hidden except for us elite
[18:11] people. But here he says we speak the
[18:14] wisdom of God in a mystery. Every you do
[18:17] the search yourself. Look up mystery in
[18:20] the New Testament. Every time mystery is
[18:22] brought, it doesn't mean that it's to
[18:24] remain hidden. It means it's revealed.
[18:27] It's something that was hidden that's
[18:29] now revealed. So Paul is saying, we
[18:31] speak the wisdom of God in a mystery. So
[18:35] he's speaking it. He's speaking the
[18:37] mystery, even the hidden wisdom which
[18:40] God ordained before the world unto our
[18:43] glory. That word ordained literally
[18:46] means for ordained.
[18:49] So this hidden wisdom was actually for
[18:52] ordained in the mind and plan of God
[18:55] before the foundation of the world for
[18:57] you to receive the revelation of it. See
[19:01] he's not speaking it for no reason. Why
[19:03] is he speaking it? Because those who are
[19:05] mature can hear and receive it.
[19:10] Amen.
[19:12] And God has or ordained
[19:15] for ordained it for our glory. Anytime
[19:19] you see this word glory, if you study it
[19:23] out, it is connected to manifestation.
[19:27] And so I find it incredible when you
[19:30] look at it. It's going to be the
[19:32] manifestation of who we are. So God
[19:37] foreord ordained the hidden wisdom to
[19:40] manifest who we are in Christ.
[19:46] And so you couldn't go to the Old
[19:47] Testament. See, there's many scriptures
[19:51] here in the Old Testament
[19:53] and you'll never see the reality of it
[19:56] until that mystery was revealed by the
[19:59] Apostle Paul. But then you see the
[20:02] church walked away from it. They fell
[20:04] away from it and went into all kinds of
[20:06] false teachings and false doctrines and
[20:09] missed these mysteries. Why? It was
[20:12] hidden to them
[20:17] which none of the princes of this world
[20:19] know knew. For had they known it, they
[20:22] would not have crucified the Lord of
[20:25] glory.
[20:27] But as it is written, I have not seen
[20:29] nor ear heard, neither have entered into
[20:32] the heart of man the things which God
[20:33] has prepared for them that love him. One
[20:36] of the most misqued verses in the entire
[20:39] Bible.
[20:42] Why? Because they stop there. And Paul
[20:44] doesn't stop there. He's he's making a
[20:47] point
[20:48] as it is written. No one can no one can
[20:52] work this out on their own.
[20:57] But God has revealed them unto us by his
[20:59] spirit. For the spirit searches all
[21:02] things, yay, the deep things of God. So
[21:05] those things that are hidden that eye
[21:07] hasn't seen or earheard, we know them.
[21:10] They've been delivered to us. It was
[21:12] hidden. It was a hidden mystery. It was
[21:15] hidden wisdom for us, for our glory.
[21:19] Amen.
[21:20] It's not to be so complicated and
[21:23] complex that young people can't
[21:25] understand it.
[21:27] Right? It's both it's a it's a
[21:29] revelation. What is the what is the
[21:31] qualification for you to receive the
[21:34] hidden wisdom?
[21:38] The baptism of the Holy Ghost. What is
[21:40] the evidence of having received the Holy
[21:42] Ghost?
[21:44] He, the Spirit of truth, will lead you
[21:46] into all truth and show you things that
[21:49] are to come. That's what Brother
[21:51] Brandham said. It's not love. It's not
[21:53] fruit. It's not tongues. It is being led
[21:58] into all truth. First, you have to have
[22:01] the Holy Ghost. You're never going to be
[22:03] led you're not you're never going to be
[22:04] led into the hidden wisdom without the
[22:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost because it's
[22:11] the spirit that searches all things. Not
[22:13] the human spirit, the spirit of God.
[22:16] For what man knoweth the things of man,
[22:18] save the spirit which is in him? Even so
[22:21] the things of God knoweth no man but the
[22:24] spirit of God.
[22:26] Again, you can you can have knowledge. 1
[22:30] Corinthians 13 speaks of this. Same same
[22:33] book same book says you can know all
[22:36] mysteries and without love you're
[22:39] nothing. See, so you can have human
[22:42] knowledge and you can come to God in the
[22:45] form of human knowledge. It's the same
[22:47] picture that we look at. The Bible says
[22:50] if you confess with your mouth that
[22:52] Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart
[22:53] that God raised him from the dead,
[22:55] you'll be saved. Is that the truth?
[22:57] Amen. That's the truth. It also says,
[23:00] "Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord,
[23:02] Lord, shall enter into the kingdom, but
[23:05] he that doeth the will of my father."
[23:08] Right? Many will come to me in that day.
[23:11] Have we not prophesied? Did Did we not
[23:13] do mighty works? My goodness. Can you
[23:15] imagine meeting God and telling him, "My
[23:19] works, my works that I've done prove
[23:22] that I'm saved. You never were saved in
[23:24] the first place. Nothing in my hands I
[23:28] bring. Simply to thy cross I cling."
[23:32] That's I come empty-handed, Lord. I have
[23:34] no good works of my own. I have nothing
[23:36] good to present to you. only the blood
[23:40] and righteousness of Jesus Christ.
[23:41] That's all I can present.
[23:44] And so a person can be anointed as
[23:48] brother Brandham showed us. They can be
[23:49] anointed with the spirit, holy spirit on
[23:52] their flesh or even on their human
[23:55] spirit and do the works of Christ
[24:01] and still be lost.
[24:03] The way he says it, you say, "But I got
[24:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost." You can
[24:08] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[24:09] day of your life and still be lost. He
[24:11] says,
[24:13] but he but the point was he said, you
[24:15] say it your version. You say, I have
[24:17] spoke with tonesues. He's talking to
[24:20] Pentecostals. You say, I spoke with
[24:22] tonesues. Well, you can speak with
[24:24] tonesues every day of your life and
[24:25] still be lost. It's not about having
[24:28] some anointing. It's about truly having
[24:30] an experience of God that leads you into
[24:33] all truth. And the word of truth does
[24:36] what? It sanctifies us. It transforms
[24:39] us. It molds us and makes us into the
[24:42] image of Jesus Christ. There's no use.
[24:45] You a person can be reformed and look
[24:47] the part. A person can be anointed on
[24:50] the spirit and look the part, but you're
[24:53] getting the cart before the horse. You
[24:55] have to have the word living in you. And
[24:59] then that will produce what God wants it
[25:01] to produce.
[25:09] 1 Corinthians 2:12, "Now we have
[25:12] received not the spirit of the world,
[25:14] but the spirit which is of God, that we
[25:17] might know the things that are freely
[25:19] given to us of God." Wow. Did you see
[25:24] what he just said there? We read over
[25:26] this so fast, so many times.
[25:30] Why did we receive the spirit of God? So
[25:32] you could shout.
[25:34] Maybe you might shout. Why did we
[25:37] receive the spirit of God? So we could
[25:39] speak with tongues. This comes along
[25:41] with it. Maybe prophesy, dance,
[25:45] sing. Sure, all those things could come.
[25:48] But that's not the real reason. What is
[25:50] the real reason, Paul? So that we would
[25:52] know.
[25:54] so that we would know
[25:57] the things that are freely given to us
[26:01] of God. You say, "Well, what difference
[26:03] does that make?" Knowing something. I
[26:05] guess God thinks it makes a difference.
[26:08] I don't care what you think. I don't
[26:09] care what I think. But apparently,
[26:12] knowing the things that are given to us
[26:14] by God is very precious in the sight of
[26:18] God. So much so that he gives us the
[26:20] Holy Spirit so that we would know it.
[26:25] Why did God go to all the trouble to
[26:28] train brother Brandham to work in his
[26:31] life to deal with him in such a a
[26:34] difficult harsh way we think humanly
[26:38] speaking
[26:40] having to lose his family over
[26:41] disobedience having to get almost die
[26:44] multiple times because he wasn't
[26:47] listening to the voice as he should. Why
[26:49] did God do that? so that he would when
[26:51] he got to the time of the opening of the
[26:53] word and the revealing of the mysteries,
[26:56] the spirit of God could flow through him
[26:59] for us to receive a revelation.
[27:03] We can't just count it as nothing and
[27:05] say, "Oh, we just need the baptism of
[27:07] the Holy Ghost." We need the baptism of
[27:09] the Holy Ghost because that helps us to
[27:11] know the things that are freely given to
[27:13] us by God. And it it's not so difficult
[27:18] and confusing. Who makes it difficult
[27:20] and confusing? The devil.
[27:25] Who?
[27:26] I'll move on from that.
[27:31] You can read between the lines of the
[27:33] hidden mystery of what I was about to
[27:35] say.
[27:38] Satan wants to make it troublesome,
[27:41] difficult, and confusing. But it's
[27:42] actually quite simple. The message of
[27:45] the hour. Christ has come down with a
[27:50] revelation to make himself known to our
[27:53] hearts so that we could be conformed to
[27:56] his image. And I'm sorry, I don't care
[27:59] what anybody has to say. There has to be
[28:01] a revealed word that would bring us to
[28:04] this place that we could be in the image
[28:06] of Christ. It is not going to just come
[28:09] merely by
[28:12] shouting in service. It's not going to
[28:14] just come merely by going to the special
[28:17] meeting. That that can be the start, but
[28:21] that can that's not going to finish it.
[28:24] That can reignite you. It's reignited
[28:26] me. That can reinspire you. It can
[28:30] refill you. But still, that's not it. If
[28:33] it's not bringing you the revelation of
[28:36] who Christ is and who you are and what
[28:38] he's doing today, it's not bringing the
[28:40] transforming power. It's not bring
[28:42] bringing rapturing faith. Yes, you must
[28:45] have the Holy Ghost to start this
[28:47] process. If you don't have the baptism
[28:48] of the Holy Ghost, we can't get in this
[28:50] condition where we don't speak about the
[28:52] experience. We don't speak about the
[28:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And it turns
[28:55] into this thing where we say, "Oh, the
[28:58] evidence of the Holy Ghost is just
[28:59] believing the message." Okay, now you're
[29:01] a Baptist again.
[29:02] It's an experience with God.
[29:05] You know that you receive it.
[29:07] It changes something in you. Not
[29:10] everything, but it starts a change. It's
[29:13] that's when the battle starts. Before
[29:16] you're not battling, you're on Satan's
[29:19] grounds and battlefield. But when you
[29:21] get the Holy Ghost, the battle begins.
[29:23] The trial begins. The trouble starts.
[29:25] The war begins.
[29:28] Why? Because God does. The devil does
[29:31] not want you to know the things that are
[29:33] freely given to you by God. Why do you
[29:36] think the de the devil hates the message
[29:38] and is trying to trying to trying to
[29:40] poke holes everywhere? Why?
[29:45] Why? Because the devil does not want you
[29:48] to know the things that are freely given
[29:50] to you by God. That's what the spirit of
[29:53] God is given to you as an individual for
[29:56] is to lead you into all truth.
[29:59] which things we also speak. Ah, so it
[30:02] has to be spoken.
[30:04] The things, the wisdom, the hidden
[30:07] wisdom has to be spoken by the five-fold
[30:10] ministry. First it comes to what? The
[30:14] messenger of the age. Then the five-fold
[30:17] ministry must stay faithful to what the
[30:19] messenger taught. That doesn't mean
[30:21] they're supposed to be parrots. Doesn't
[30:23] mean they're supposed to be able to
[30:25] press play. That means they're supposed
[30:27] to be able to take the word and place it
[30:29] in the Bible and preach it to you so
[30:32] that a revelation would come into your
[30:34] heart because that God has given you
[30:36] something freely and it must be spoken
[30:38] to you to me not in the words which
[30:42] man's wisdom teaches but which the Holy
[30:45] Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things
[30:48] with spiritual.
[30:51] Amen. Only the Holy Ghost can reveal it
[30:53] to you. Only the seventh seal can only
[30:56] be revealed to your heart by the Holy
[31:00] Ghost. Why? Because it's a mystery.
[31:03] Why is it a mystery? So, it's supposed
[31:05] to say hidden. No, it's it's a mystery
[31:09] because God is going to take that which
[31:11] is hidden to the world. It's not going
[31:13] to be broke to the public. The seventh
[31:14] seal is not meant for the public. It'll
[31:17] never be broken to the public. It's only
[31:19] to be broken into your heart to bring
[31:23] transforming power to your life. It's
[31:27] that hidden wisdom is what the Holy
[31:29] Ghost teaches. The Holy Ghost teaches.
[31:32] Amen. He anoints a teacher to teach you.
[31:35] He anoints a pastor to teach you. He
[31:37] anoints a prophet to teach you, an
[31:39] evangelist to teach you,
[31:43] etc. So, an apostle to teach you
[31:48] and comparing spiritual things with
[31:51] spiritual. I Let's Let's just move past
[31:52] that. I'll never get anywhere
[31:56] on this message. So, but the natural man
[32:00] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[32:02] of God. This is to me, this is this
[32:05] chapter is so incredible. What a perfect
[32:08] synopsis of the purpose of the message.
[32:12] The natural man receives not the things
[32:13] of the spirit of God. You in your human
[32:16] nature cannot really receive the true
[32:20] revelation
[32:21] of the seventh seal.
[32:25] You you you you might learn about it.
[32:27] You might read it, but that's not even
[32:30] the purpose of it. The purpose of it is
[32:33] so that it would come on the inside of
[32:34] you and change you. That's why it's
[32:38] hidden. That's why Satan can't mimic it.
[32:40] That's why that's why the the false
[32:43] church could never produce it because
[32:45] it's it's not just merely words. It's
[32:49] words in a life.
[32:51] It's words that have come into the place
[32:54] where the spirit of God resides and is
[32:56] making Jesus Christ known. The same
[32:58] yesterday, today, and forever.
[33:02] The natural man, the the this hidden
[33:04] wisdom is foolishness to him. He hates
[33:07] it. He despises it. He calls it
[33:11] nonsense. He call He says it's of the
[33:13] devil.
[33:15] It's deception.
[33:18] Right? That's what they think. But
[33:20] neither can he know them. He can't know
[33:22] him. It's not for him because it's
[33:24] spiritually discerned.
[33:28] But he that's spiritual discerns all
[33:31] things. Yet he himself is discerned of
[33:36] no man. Jud, it says judgeth, but it's
[33:38] the same same word there. Spiritually
[33:41] discerned, spiritually judged. But he
[33:44] that is spiritual will discern. We we
[33:46] can if you have the Holy Ghost, it will
[33:50] wade through any error and go directly
[33:53] to the truth.
[33:55] And everybody can try to judge you and
[33:57] discern you, but you're actually who's
[34:00] going to who who is going to bring any
[34:01] charge against God's elect? It's God
[34:04] that justifith, right?
[34:07] For who hath known the mind of the Lord
[34:09] that he may instruct him? No one. But
[34:12] we've been given a gift. What is that
[34:15] gift? We have the mind of Christ. Amen.
[34:18] How does the mind of Christ come? By the
[34:21] Holy Ghost teaching you all things.
[34:24] Amen.
[34:26] All right.
[34:28] Now,
[34:32] back to Revelation chapter 8.
[34:37] When he opened the seventh seal, there
[34:38] was silence in heaven about the space of
[34:40] half an hour. This is where I I left it
[34:42] before where we're where where we need
[34:44] to let's look at the rest of these
[34:46] verses before each of the trumpet comes.
[34:49] Let's look at at the remainder.
[34:53] And I saw the seven angels which stood
[34:54] before God. And to them were given seven
[34:58] trumpets.
[34:59] And again, I'm not going to go into
[35:00] every single detail. So there's a
[35:02] something I'm looking at here that I
[35:04] want to to to speak about. So these are
[35:08] seven angels. They're given seven
[35:10] trumpets. Clearly we see that as we go
[35:13] through the rest of the chapter 8,
[35:14] chapter nine, and then into chapter 11,
[35:18] you see the seventh trumpet. But these
[35:21] are g they're given the trumpets. They
[35:23] have not been deployed yet.
[35:26] The seventh seal is broken. Silence in
[35:29] heaven. They're given seven trumpets,
[35:32] but not deployed yet.
[35:35] And another angel came and stood at the
[35:37] altar having a golden sensor. And there
[35:41] was given unto him much incense, that he
[35:43] should offer it with the prayers of all
[35:46] saints upon the golden altar which was
[35:49] before the throne. And the smoke of the
[35:52] incense which came with the prayers of
[35:55] the saints ascended up before God out of
[35:59] the angel's hand.
[36:01] And the angel took the sensor and filled
[36:03] it with fire of the altar and cast it
[36:06] into the earth. And there were voices
[36:09] and thunderings and lightnings and an
[36:11] earthquake. So, this is the scene that's
[36:15] set in heaven at the opening of the
[36:20] seventh seal.
[36:22] I've never really, of course, I've read
[36:24] it over and over and over and over
[36:26] again, but I've never stopped to think
[36:29] about what was being said. So, here we
[36:34] have seventh seal open, silence in
[36:36] heaven, and then here's the angels
[36:39] presented to us. And then another angel
[36:43] comes to me. This is a picture of course
[36:46] in the temple. It speaks of the temple
[36:50] and it speaks of the golden altar. Now
[36:54] remember, of course, the trumpets call
[36:57] Israel to the feast. They're used of God
[37:00] to bring Israel back into position.
[37:06] That's what that's what the seven
[37:07] trumpets do. that are bringing Israel
[37:09] back into position and the place that
[37:11] God wants them to have. I don't want to
[37:13] spend a lot of time on that.
[37:16] These trumpets sound through the age,
[37:19] but are revealed by two witnesses during
[37:22] the tribulation period, much like the
[37:24] seals. The seals happen throughout the
[37:27] church age period, but they're opened
[37:29] and the understanding of them is given
[37:31] towards the end of the church age in the
[37:33] seventh church age only for the bride.
[37:37] The trumpets, though they happened
[37:39] through the age, are revealed to the
[37:43] 144,000 by the two witnesses. This will
[37:46] be part of their message.
[37:49] However, before that can happen,
[37:52] we find another angel is given incests
[37:55] to burn with the prayers of the saints.
[37:59] And the angel is going to burn the
[38:00] incense on the golden altar. This is not
[38:03] the mercy seat. This is the golden
[38:06] altar. The mercy seat is in the holiest
[38:09] of holies. The golden altar is actually
[38:13] just outside
[38:16] the holy of holies, right? I have the
[38:19] veil and just outside. So the throne of
[38:21] God would be here would be like the
[38:24] mercy seat in heaven. That place where
[38:27] you have the holy of holies.
[38:30] But just outside of that you have the
[38:32] golden altar.
[38:35] Now
[38:37] during during this dur during the Old
[38:40] Testament uh it's it speaks of Aaron was
[38:44] the one who was to come daily and do
[38:48] maintenance in not in the most in the
[38:50] most holy place not in the holy of
[38:52] holies but in the holy place. They come
[38:55] inside the temple not in the outer court
[38:57] but inside the temple and they go to the
[39:01] golden altar. They make sure that the
[39:03] manora, the seven golden candlesticks
[39:06] are still burning. If you remember
[39:08] Zechariah,
[39:10] Zechariah was a priest. Now in in when
[39:13] Moses writes of this in the Torah, he
[39:15] says Aaron is to do it. But understand
[39:18] that that priests are not Levi. Levites.
[39:20] There's a difference.
[39:23] O only people that can come and do do
[39:27] the work of a priest is from the tribe
[39:31] is from Aaron's family. See?
[39:34] And so they are the ones that can
[39:36] qualify to become a high priest. So you
[39:39] have a high priest. He's the he's like
[39:42] the he's the chief priest. He's the
[39:43] head, but he doesn't do all the work.
[39:45] He's the one that goes in on the day of
[39:48] atonement to the the most holy place.
[39:52] But they have many assignments of the
[39:54] family of Aaron of priests. Zechariah
[39:57] they came to his assignment. He was to
[39:59] go he was to go to Jerusalem. They
[40:01] stayed there for a period of time. See
[40:03] they lived somewhere else. They came to
[40:05] Jerusalem stayed for a period of time.
[40:07] It fell on his lot. It was his turn. And
[40:09] it was his duty to go in the morning and
[40:12] maintain the the golden candlestick. And
[40:15] to to do that they had to take the fire.
[40:18] They burned incense etc. that was part
[40:21] of what needed to be done. However, if
[40:24] we if we go back to it, it's Aaron
[40:26] that's supposed to do it. So, it's a
[40:27] high it's really the duty of the high
[40:30] priest though there's many many priests.
[40:33] There's many people from the family of
[40:35] Aaron that can do that. All right. I I
[40:39] hope you're starting to think about the
[40:42] bigger picture here and the typology
[40:44] here. Keep that in your mind. If you
[40:47] remember, what does the golden
[40:48] candlesticks represent?
[40:50] Christ is walking in the midst of the
[40:51] golden candlesticks. H
[40:55] what's that mean? Christ our high priest
[40:59] maintaining what? The manora.
[41:02] Who has to maintain the manora? The
[41:05] family of Aaron. The high priest. Who is
[41:08] the who is the priest of the new
[41:09] covenant? It's not from the family of
[41:11] Aaron. It's after the order of
[41:12] Melkazedc. So who I wonder who this
[41:15] another angel is. Now, the Bible in the
[41:17] in throughout the book of Revelation, it
[41:20] does say another angel. Another angel,
[41:21] another angel, and then in Revelation
[41:23] 10, we say another mighty angel. Here,
[41:26] it doesn't say another mighty angel, but
[41:28] it says another angel.
[41:30] I don't know who it could be. Do you
[41:33] know who it could be? I think it's
[41:35] Christ. That's my personal take that.
[41:37] Somebody could argue and say it's
[41:38] somebody else, but who I mean, this is a
[41:42] this is under the new covenant. Who is
[41:45] the sacrifice? Who is the high priest?
[41:48] It's not you.
[41:50] It's not me. It's not your pastor.
[41:54] There's one sacrifice. It's Christ.
[41:57] And so here he goes. And I want you to
[42:00] look and notice this.
[42:04] So he comes with a golden sensor, comes
[42:06] with much incense to burn it,
[42:10] and he's going to offer it what? With
[42:13] the prayers of all the saints. Now,
[42:14] everything you read, every commentary
[42:16] you read, they say the incense is the
[42:19] prayer of the saints. That's not what
[42:20] it's saying.
[42:22] He offers the incense with the prayers
[42:26] of the all the saints upon the golden
[42:29] altar which was before the throne.
[42:34] And the smoke of incense which came
[42:37] what? With the prayers of the saints
[42:41] ascended up before God. Now,
[42:45] I think the next scripture, yes, Numbers
[42:49] 16:46.
[42:51] And Moses said unto Aaron, "Take a
[42:52] sensor and put fire therein from off the
[42:55] altar, and put on incense, and go
[42:57] quickly unto the congregation, and make
[43:00] an atonement for them, for there is
[43:02] wrath gone out from the Lord, the plague
[43:04] is begun." And Aaron took as Moses
[43:07] commanded and ran into the midst of the
[43:09] congregation. And behold, the plague was
[43:11] begun among the people, and he put on
[43:13] incense and made an atonement for the
[43:16] people. So we look at this verse again.
[43:22] He's offering it with the prayers of the
[43:24] saints. What is the incense that's being
[43:27] offered then? If it's not, if the
[43:30] incense is not the prayers of the
[43:32] saints, what is being offered? There's
[43:33] one only one sacrifice for sin. This can
[43:36] only speak of the the merits of Christ.
[43:41] The righteousness of Jesus Christ is
[43:43] offered there as incense as a sweet
[43:46] smelling savor. Now your prayers by
[43:49] themselves, what are they? Your good
[43:52] works by themselves, what are they?
[43:54] Filthy rags in the sight of God. But
[43:57] your prayers are what? They're not just
[44:00] alone. What are they done? They're
[44:02] combined. The incense of Christ's
[44:06] perfect righteousness combines with your
[44:08] prayers. So how can you distinguish? You
[44:12] can't separate it. It's now one. Your
[44:14] prayers have become one with Christ. So
[44:18] now there's this uni unity between your
[44:22] prayers and the offering of Christ.
[44:26] Right? But then go take it take it one
[44:28] step further. If we look at
[44:32] Moses speaking to Aaron, take a sensor
[44:36] and do what? Make an atonement.
[44:40] Now, we understand that the offering was
[44:43] made through Christ at Calvary. It's a
[44:47] finished work. There needs to be no more
[44:50] sacrifice for sin.
[44:54] But this also here is not a sacrifice.
[44:58] But mo God through Moses tells him to
[45:03] take the incense and make it into an
[45:06] atonement. How many knows what an
[45:08] atonement is?
[45:11] Atonement means at onement.
[45:13] It means oneness is restored between the
[45:17] the offending party and the one who's
[45:19] offended. So now when an atonement is
[45:22] made, it makes
[45:26] God
[45:28] and the saints what? One. That's
[45:32] perfect. The prayers of the saints and
[45:35] the incense become one. The works of the
[45:37] saints and the Holy Spirit become one.
[45:40] The the spirit and the bride say what?
[45:43] Come with one voice. Amen. Now, let's
[45:47] keep going because I I don't want you to
[45:49] miss the importance of this day, the
[45:53] importance of the opening of the seven
[45:55] seals.
[45:57] It I it it's it's actually quite simple.
[45:59] If you feel like you're confused now,
[46:01] you won't be by the time we're done.
[46:03] Just depends on how long that takes.
[46:07] Don't don't get scared. I'm not fixing
[46:09] to close.
[46:12] Right. The preaching's so good. You You
[46:14] wouldn't want me to close, would you?
[46:17] I'm teasing
[46:20] this reverse psychology, I guess.
[46:22] Whatever.
[46:27] Daniel 12:4. But thou, oh Daniel, shut
[46:29] up the words and seal the book, even to
[46:32] the time of the end. Many shall run to
[46:35] and fro, and knowledge shall be
[46:37] increased. Now, I want you to get this
[46:38] because we're not, you think I'm not
[46:40] talking about atonement anymore. I'm
[46:42] talking about atonement. See,
[46:46] just because the sacrifice is finished
[46:49] doesn't mean that there's not a
[46:50] salvation at the end time. See, this
[46:53] this this is critical to understand.
[46:56] Now, Daniel has a vision and he's told,
[46:59] "Seal it up till when?"
[47:02] The end time. All right, let's keep
[47:06] going. Then Daniel Then I, Daniel,
[47:08] looked and behold, there stood other
[47:10] two. The one on this side of the bank of
[47:12] the river, another on that side of the
[47:13] bank of the river. And one said to the
[47:16] man clothed in linen, the man clothed in
[47:18] linen is equal to Revelation 10, the
[47:22] mighty angel. The man clothed in linen,
[47:25] which was upon the waters of the river.
[47:28] How long shall it be to the end of these
[47:30] wonders? I heard the man clothed in
[47:33] linen which was upon the waters of the
[47:34] river when he held up his right hand and
[47:36] his left hand unto heaven and swear by
[47:38] him that liveth forever and ever that it
[47:39] shall be for a time times and a half
[47:43] three and a half years when he shall
[47:45] have accomplished to scatter the power
[47:47] of the holy people all these things
[47:48] shall be finished. So when the purpose
[47:50] of what's
[47:52] sealed is opened
[47:55] is finished there's only three and a
[47:57] half years left. All right.
[48:00] Verse eight. And I heard, but I
[48:02] understood not. Then said I, "Oh my
[48:04] Lord, what shall be the end of these
[48:06] things?" Daniel's persistent. He wants
[48:09] an answer. I don't understand it. Help
[48:11] me to understand. See, he's he the un
[48:14] the revelation, the vision is there.
[48:17] It's written in the in the word, but the
[48:19] understanding, the revelation of what it
[48:21] means is not there. And Daniel says,
[48:24] "Clarify this. give me the revelation of
[48:26] this thing. And he said, "Go your way,
[48:29] Daniel."
[48:31] The words are closed up and sealed till
[48:34] the time of the end.
[48:37] The understanding is not going to be
[48:39] given, Daniel, until the end time. This
[48:42] is when it has to come. And this is the
[48:44] key verse that I'm trying to get to.
[48:46] Many shall be purified and made white
[48:49] and tried, but the wicked shall do
[48:51] wickedly, and none of the wicked shall
[48:53] understand. But the wise shall
[48:55] understand. See, the Holy Spirit is the
[48:58] one that teaches us the things that are
[49:00] given to us freely by God. So what what
[49:04] is the opening of the word to do at the
[49:07] end time? It's to bring us an
[49:09] understanding. What's the difference
[49:11] between the the wise and the wicked?
[49:14] An understanding.
[49:16] So how how can we say it's not
[49:18] necessary? It's not needed. We we need a
[49:21] revelation not by words which man's
[49:24] wisdom teaches but by what the Holy
[49:26] Ghost teaches. First get the Holy Ghost
[49:28] and that Holy Ghost will lead you to a
[49:30] revelation of the truth.
[49:33] All right. The wicked are wicked because
[49:36] they don't understand. They haven't
[49:38] received the revelation.
[49:41] And because of that they do wickedly. So
[49:43] if you had the revelation he wouldn't do
[49:44] wickedly.
[49:47] But notice what it says at the start.
[49:50] This opening of the word at the end time
[49:53] does what?
[49:55] Will purify and make you white. And of
[50:00] course it will try you also.
[50:03] So I thought the blood of Christ
[50:06] purifies us. Yes, it does. But what is
[50:09] what is that what does that come by? And
[50:13] this is this is the problem. We're
[50:15] limited to time. We're not eternal
[50:16] creatures. So,
[50:20] it'll take me another 30 minutes to get
[50:22] to the answer to that question that I
[50:23] just gave. So, you won't get it till
[50:25] next time, but we'll try to get close.
[50:30] So, there's a purifica. There's an
[50:32] atonement that takes place at the
[50:35] opening of the seventh seal. Amen.
[50:38] There's an incense that's offered at the
[50:41] golden altar that becomes one with the
[50:44] saints that purifies them and makes them
[50:47] white. Amen. And it's all based on the
[50:50] blood of Jesus Christ being shed for you
[50:52] and me.
[50:55] 1 Peter 15, who are kept by the power of
[50:58] God through faith unto salvation, ready
[51:02] to be revealed in the last time. I
[51:04] thought salvation was revealed 2,000
[51:06] years ago at Calvary.
[51:11] Redemption has two parts, right?
[51:14] So redemption first, a price has to be
[51:17] paid. But that's not that's not all of
[51:20] it. Redemption means to take back to
[51:24] bring back to its original owner. So the
[51:27] next part is to bring back to its
[51:29] original owner. So there's a salvation
[51:32] that's going to be revealed. What is
[51:34] revealed? Something that's hidden
[51:38] has to be unveiled. See, I it's it's
[51:41] like you have a statue and there's and
[51:44] there is a sheet over it and nobody
[51:46] knows what the statue is. Then you pull
[51:50] that sheet off and everybody can see it.
[51:52] That's what has to happen to bring
[51:55] salvation at the end time. So what's the
[51:58] important of the me importance of the
[51:59] message? It's going to bring us
[52:01] salvation. It's bringing us an
[52:03] atonement. Amen.
[52:06] All right,
[52:09] from the indictment should all be
[52:11] familiar with this quote. It's very
[52:13] important now and Christ is God's
[52:16] provided lamb. Notice how appropriate it
[52:19] was showing that that Jerusalem was
[52:22] ceasing when it was in in effect until
[52:25] that hour. The blood of the lamb was all
[52:28] right. The the sacrificial lamb in the
[52:31] temple, it was all right until that day.
[52:34] But now at the crucifixion, it changes.
[52:37] The old system is done. There was a new
[52:40] one. And the lamb, speaking of Christ,
[52:43] was at the sacrifice. The lamb, the
[52:45] sacrificial lamb was on the grounds.
[52:47] They were condemning and doing the very
[52:49] thing there that they had to do. That's
[52:51] right. God be blessed for seeing this
[52:54] wonderful heavenly light in this last
[52:56] day because the churches is doing the
[52:58] same thing today until the hour that
[53:01] organization, religion is condemned. and
[53:04] proved to be sacrificing Christ's word.
[53:06] From then on comes to the word and the
[53:09] word only. From the old pascal lamb
[53:11] passed away and Christ become our lamb
[53:14] at the day of the crucifixion. And the
[53:16] day that the denomination crucified the
[53:18] word of God and accepted a creed instead
[53:20] of the word, that's the day the word
[53:23] come into full effect. That's just been
[53:27] recently. So what does it do? What is he
[53:30] saying?
[53:33] What does he what what is the change? We
[53:35] saw it right here. An atonement is made
[53:38] at the opening of the seventh seal. If
[53:40] that's rejected, what happens? That's
[53:43] that's finished for you. What happens?
[53:45] He's gone to the word and the word only.
[53:48] Does that mean the blood of Christ no
[53:50] longer applies? No. That means now the
[53:52] blood of Christ fully applies the way
[53:54] it's supposed to been throughout all the
[53:56] ages. Why? Because they left the word.
[53:59] It's the word had been trampled on and
[54:02] held in check by denominations for 1900
[54:06] years. But now the word is opened. That
[54:09] which they left, we've been restored
[54:11] back to. Amen. And what what is it? What
[54:15] is it? We've seen it. It's it becomes an
[54:17] atonement for us.
[54:21] Ephesians 5. Musicians, if you'd come.
[54:25] Husbands, love your wives even as Christ
[54:27] also loved the church and gave himself
[54:30] for it. This is where I want to get.
[54:33] That he might sanctify and cleanse it
[54:35] with the washing of water by the word.
[54:40] That he might present it to himself a
[54:42] glorious church, not having spot or
[54:45] wrinkle or any such thing, but that it
[54:47] should be holy and without
[54:50] blemish. So that is this atonement. It's
[54:54] the bleeding word. It's the bloody word.
[54:56] It's the word has become blood.
[55:00] Right now, that word that you're hearing
[55:03] preached to you because what is the
[55:05] opening of the seventh seal? It's the
[55:07] opening of the word. What is the opening
[55:09] of the word? It's the restoration back
[55:10] to the original faith. Those mysteries
[55:12] which have been hidden through the ages
[55:14] are now revealed to us. And when that
[55:16] revelation comes to you, that atonement
[55:19] comes to you. how when he sees you,
[55:21] there's an invisible union and what what
[55:24] happens? He says, "You never even sinned
[55:26] in the first place. You have on the
[55:29] wedding band of unmmerited grace." Amen.
[55:33] Your sins are sent to the sea of
[55:36] forgetfulness. But I thought that
[55:38] happened at Calvary. That's what that's
[55:41] where the price was paid. But remember,
[55:44] they left the original word. And we've
[55:47] got to come back to the original word.
[55:49] How can he present to himself a church
[55:51] without spot or without wrinkle if
[55:53] they're believing a false word, a false
[55:57] revelation? So, a true revelation has to
[56:00] come back for the bride to be cleansed
[56:03] by that revelation. And in that
[56:05] cleansing, that's where you're one with
[56:08] him. That's where oneness is restored
[56:12] with Christ. That's where when Christ
[56:14] when God looks upon you, what does he
[56:17] see? Not you, but Christ in you. Let's
[56:21] pray.
[56:23] Heavenly Father, we thank you so much
[56:24] for your word. Lord God, there's there's
[56:29] so much here and so much more here,
[56:31] Lord. I pray, Father, that what's been
[56:33] spoken, Lord, you would bring it as a
[56:35] revelation to every heart. Lord, that
[56:39] even down to the youngest ones, Lord,
[56:40] that it would become quickened,
[56:44] Lord, in their soul. that it would bring
[56:46] bring a transforming power in their
[56:48] life. Lord, an overcoming power in their
[56:51] life as it's promised to do. Lord, we
[56:54] thank you for for all the great
[56:57] blessings you've poured upon us through
[57:00] this message. Lord, continue Lord to
[57:03] move and work in our lives and set us
[57:06] free, Lord, from the things that so
[57:08] tries to so easily beset us. Father, we
[57:12] commit ourselves to you for your glory
[57:14] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Let's stand
[57:17] and worship the Lord together for a few
[57:19] minutes.
