morning let's give Sister Sarah a [Applause] hand [Music] a horrible time trying to sleep and uh I went days weeks without hardly any sleep all and I had come up here and got prayed for last Sunday and I felt the Lord when I went back to my seat I felt a presence come near me and it's like it went and I knew at that moment I was like I'm going to sleep tonight well I went home went to bed that night I couldn't sleep tossed and turned all night long could not sleep and I was like Lord I know I felt your presence what what is going on here and next morning I was so tired I had to get up for work and I was literally crying I looked at my husband and I said I can't keep going like this I said I've got to have some sleep so I text a group of people and I said you've got to pray for me because if I can't get sleep I can't go to Camp I said I'm so tired I said I can't even think straight half the time well they started praying and that night I went to bed and I slept so good and the next night I went to bed and I slept so good and the next night I went to bed and I slept so good and I've been sleeping so good since then and I'm so thankful that the Lord touched me if you've never gone without sleep you don't know what it's like and maybe this sounds foolish to some people but if you've been there you know and I'm so grateful that the Lord has helped me and I just wanted to give him praise for that this [Music] morning [Music] once upon his back he knew this was the beginning of the end with every fragile step he grew more and more determined to finish it the world saw a man with a tree on his back and they left but God saw his son who he loved carry more than that oh he didn't just carry the cross but he carried [Music] me he didn't just count the cost but he counted [Music] me so much has been said about Calvary oh but I [Music] believe he didn't just carry the cross but he carried [Music] me mercy held my broken heart close against his shoulder as he [Music] went love beyond the moment held the scars and hands and feet of one I've never met the world saw a man die a Marty between two [Music] thieves but God saw a lamb Bridge a gap of [Applause] [Music] etern oh he didn't just carry a cross but he carried he didn't just count the cost but he counted [Music] me so much has been said of what happened at calary oh but I believe he didn't just carry a cross but he carried me oh he didn't just carry the cross but he carried [Music] me he didn't just count the cost but he counted me [Music] so much has been said of what happened at calary oh but I

into the house of God lord we we don't I don't come here to be a to become a Christian I'm already a Christian I I come here for strength that I need that we come together Lord for the strength that we need and if there's some who don't know you then I pray today they'll know you in a very real way I pray that you will help us in the word and Lord we ask the prayer for sister Debbie this morning

Mercy we're asking you to come on the scene even right now oh God and move on her behalf I pray that you'll bless your word today blessed speaker and hearer of your word father I commit myself into your hands in Jesus name amen God bless you friends let's turn to Matthew chapter 22 praise the Lord I'm really excited for Camp coming up and uh I just know I believe the Lord is going to do great things for us amen Matthew 22 and we're going to catch 34 through 40 and then I've got another scripture we'll go to but I'm going to let you be seated after after we read this amen but when the Pharisees heard had heard that Jesus had put the Sadducees to silence they were gathered together then one of them which was a lawyer and this is a a a student of the law it's not like an attorney like we would have today it's a student of the law then when one of them which was a lawyer an expert in the law asked him a question tempting him and saying Master which is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated keep your Bibles handy we'll go um to John 16 momentarily amen and I just covet your undivided waiting for the otion St we get a legitimate exitus from the platform but we get a unfavorable Exodus from the building uh right as I seat the people and I'd sure like to see that stop amen I know it can be done I raised my children that way they went to the restroom when they arrived at church and they didn't go again and didn't need to go again until the service was concluded and if they had an emergent emergency I would always let them go but it wasn't you know this idea of just an automatic thing so I'd like to see that stop like to see parents bring that under a tighter regulation and goodness sake let's not have parents doing it amen all right I ask your prayer for me this morning I've got a rather unusual approach to this sermon today and I I I'm I'm I'm trying to just be very studious and I really covet your undivided attention um we're going to go into some areas today and I just want to be very careful how I cover it don't want to give the wrong impression what I'm the impression I'm trying to avoid is that I'm up here preaching Christian psychology I want to avoid you thinking that all right because I don't that's not what I'm going to be doing today but I am going to be doing some compar compon between Christian psychology and real faith brother brandham did that just in case you don't know in wisdom versus Faith all right amen so I'm I'm right in the line in order of the Prophet okay all right so according to Jesus here he is saying that the first great commandment is to love the Lord with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind now then he comes to a second one and I want to propose to you today that the second commandment you'll notice that Jesus says it's like unto so in other words it's related to the first so I want you now if you can grasp that I want you to go one more step and realize that it's really a continuation of the first it's an outcropping of the first it's it's a harvest of the first it's a result of the first it's a continuation of the first all right so it's not like a second separate rule that you say well I can get one but I don't know about that second one if you don't have the second one you don't have the first one amen is that easy if you don't have the second one you don't have the first one and so Jesus ties the these two together and he doesn't even go into lying and murder and adultery and idolatry and all these different things he doesn't even visit the Ten Commandments other than right here and he says on this one thing and its natural continuation hang all the law and the prophets this is everything the law was designed to achieve this is everything the prophets taught this is is not only what they taught but they lived all right so according to James we're not going to turn to it today but in I just got one verse in James 2:8 which is familiar you'll recognize it uh James tells us uh you know how that how that there's a royal law um I I probably should turn you to it give me James 28 brother Mark I'm sorry to jump you uh by surprise but let's let's have that just so I can fit that in amen let me make one quick adjustment here perfect okay so so sometimes people laugh at me because I'm the guy who has backups to my backups of my backups and so today technology was weird weird and so me being me I made a backup in a different place and since my first one isn't working now I'm on my backup so you know the Jesus saves brother Jason saves I back up amen James 2:8 if you fulfill the Royal law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself you do well so so we realize that James here is is calling Jesus second addition or Jesus's addendum or his Adon to the first commandment upon which all the law and Prophets hang and James is now going to label that that's the Royal law so because of this being true it's the Royal law of God's Kingdom so then we would call it then and I would be able to say today it's a royal man it's a manifestation of the royal family am I connecting the dots I'm not going too fast am I all right so we've come from the one law upon which all the prophets and and and all the law and everything was founded upon and that is there's nothing more important or even to be mentioned other than this this is the cure all that will cure all and deliver all and make the royal family live like the royal family is if you love the Lord God with all your heart and all your mind and all your soul amen all right all right so it so it becomes a royal manifestation it is not sufficient Jesus talks about this that there are people in his day and there are people in our day who honor God with their lips but their heart is far from him and that is a a problem that would only be exacerbated with the burgeoning of humanity across the world for the last 2,000 years and we go from so many millions and then a billion and then two and then three and four and five six seven and approaching 8 billion so that that issue would only increase and in fact is Paul told us that it would be not just acute at the last day but it would be and the reason it would be so so perilous is because it would be personified in the masses of humanity that they would have a form of godliness but they would deny the power amen that that that that they would have a form of godliness but they would and brother brandham said that means they deny the real realities They Don't Really allow Christ to come in and change their life amen amen you know it's it's it's it's just ironic and so so now that if you really do love love the Lord thy God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind then then you are you are you are at the beginning properly you have started the race that Paul spoke of and now you can accomplish great things for God's kingdom because you'll manifest th that fact that your heart not just your lips but your heart loves God and you've dedicated your whole soul and your whole mind which means you've made him the center of everything you do he's not a sidebar I I can tell who makes God a who makes Christ a sidebar by their Church attendance their Christianity is a Christianity of convenience and if it can work out and everything can be convenient then I'll I'll I'll I'll act and do and you'll think I'm a Christian but if it if it cramps my style hinders my schedule or keeps me from chasing my own personal dreams and my own agenda then you know I I'm not going to appear as fervent and the amazing thing is God just lets you do that see Israel I'm going to tell you what happens Israel asked for those Quail they were tired of the bread and they and the Bible says God granted it to them but added leanness to their soul so Chase your own dreams at your own Peril I'm not saying you're not a child of God I'm saying he's not the center of your life you're not you're you're and therefore your manifestation shows he's not the center of your life now am I am I condemning you well I the Holy Ghost doesn't condemn so much as he convicts and I hope that if if if that's you today maybe you're streaming and maybe there'll be a little tinge of conviction and you'll say to yourself if you don't say anything else you might not even say it out loud but you just say I'm G to change that amen how many have had that happen I've had things where I just observed wrong Within Myself and I just said to myself that's not going to be a part of me and I'm going to change that and I and the only way I can is more surrender because the Lord will change that for me see so I don't want to make you mad and you cut me off right at the beginning so just stay right with me please I'm trying to help us today so it's a the Royal law produces a manifestation that identifies the royal family remember it's all about identification so therefore the first great commandment is to love him with all your heart and soul and mind and the second is akin to it to love your neighbor as yourself and the second law is called the Royal manifestation it my own in my own way of saying it so it it's something that will be evident uh in the lives of those who are part of the royal family those who truly love God with all their mind soul and their heart and and they hold him as first in their lives all right now we're going to go brother Mark to John 16 now Jesus knew verse 19 I'm sorry John 16:1 19-2 24 now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them do you inquire among yourselves of that I said a little while and you shall not see me again a little while and you shall see me verily verily I say unto you that you shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into Joy you're seeing that on the world scene today you're seeing the ungodly rejoice and you're seeing The Godly in sorrow see and and you're you're you're finding he says but don't worry your sorrow shall be turned into Joy a woman he's going to give an analogy that every woman who's had a child can relate to a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow that's no joke that's for real because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child I watched this happen to my wife three times it was like magic I couldn't believe it and and I was thinking about this scripture that that but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remember no more the anguish for joy that a man is Born Into the world and I literally watched her go from pain and suffering and crying and Agony and as soon as the child was delivered and handed to her joy and smiles and and and immediately the tears you know are because her nerves are still and the tears are still coming but she's happy see and so and you now therefore have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you and in that day you shall ask me nothing verily verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it you hitherto you have asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive catch this line that your joy may be full amen I could have very easily uh titled this sermon uh today uh on the fullness of joy however uh I I that's kind of what I want to bring it down to today so we find that people you know searching for meaning people do that it's a natural human tendency to search for meaning for purpose for happiness and for contentment I think about some uh some very fin looking young people they were more Mormon by faith and they were being interviewed by a Christian evangelist on the street and he was um he was just asking them about eternal life and you know you may have you may have seen I subscribed to his channel he's got very good ways of approaching people one onone and he says I you know imagine I've got a knife in my back I've got three minutes to live what can you tell me I don't want to go to hell I'd like to go to heaven what can you tell me and they said well you know that depends he goes I got two and half minutes left what can you tell me Well we don't really believe in a hell oh my goodness I'm down to two minutes how do I get in heaven okay you don't believe in a Hell how do I get in heaven well you know there's going to be works but I thought Jesus said I couldn't get there by my works I'm down to a minute and a half help me please don't let me die and they're all you know they're they're taken back by this sudden uh approach and and you know it was sad because I found out you know as as they were testifying that they first first of all they don't really believe that anyone goes to hell which is contrary to the Bible and the and we find that they pretty much think feel that everybody goes to some level of Heaven and the level of Heaven you get to go to it will depend on the works that you do and so you can earn your way to a level three of version of heaven or if you really go all out you get a version a level six and you might get I don't know how many many levels they even have but the upper echelon level put puts you up there and you become like God himself you become a God and then you go off and you know and and Pioneer your own creation and world and the cycle just goes on and goes on and goes on and goes on and I thought about that and I'm not here today to take such exception to that you know um I I I saw I I'm I'm speaking about the sadness that I felt in in thinking about these poor people What a Sad Awakening they're going to have on that day I I saw a documentary was actually a very moving documentary I would even recommend it um possibly I would but it was uh by a Grammy awardwinning artist I'll Reserve his name for now but he's W 19 Grammys he's the most decorated has the most sold the most gospel music of any gospel singer and artist in history and you know and and there he was talking about the the childhood the painful childhood is very heart-rending and it had somewhat of a happy ending but filled with sadness also and it and you know and and and there was some Redemption that went on between him and his father and then him to his son you know broken people end up producing broken people and and he was dealing with this and coming to terms with and he'd been you know had quite a um um absent a daddy and absent really a mother and was adopted and and and really it was heartbreaking it was really heartbreaking but what was more heartbreaking is that as he talked about his Christianity and he talked about Christ in such glowing words like you and I Mike would talk about the Lord and then he goes into his anguish and he's he and then the anger comes up and he says I've spent my whole life you know trying to figure out who and he he literally utters a Common Street vulgarity who the blank I am and he stops with forming the first letters and his wife just don't say that you're on camera and you realize my goodness that what I'm seeing is not even the real himym and and then and then a little while later he's actually they let they put it on the documentary and he says I can't I can't see how in the hll people can think I'm thinking I thought you were a Christian now I'm not here to even condemn that artist uh you know something because brother brandham talks about misinterpreted the ology and he says you know women say they read the scripture about cutting hair and say well my pastor said that that I don't have to follow that and brother brandham said he'll suffer for it in the regions Beyond so I can see why they HED desperately William Brandon was a false prophet because if he wasn't they're doomed and and and I'm not even really trying to come down and I I felt sorry for this musical artist artist uh and and I I felt sorry you know me I I thought to myself it was ironic because when you think about brother brand because what they've saw is such a misrepresentation yes they've not just heard misinterpreted theology they've not only maybe not heard the message of there like brother brandham said concerning Jackie Kennedy he said but you know maybe she never heard one of my messages maybe if she would have things could be different I that that made me glow inside I thought what a wonderful thing for brother brandham to say and you know because there you don't ever want to take hope away and I always say as long as Jesus is on the throne there's always hope you're never hopeless as long as he reigns so I and I'm trying to get to my real EXP expression of my heart today so it's it's not that you know I'm that they just haven't maybe picked up a book and and read something or heard a tape or came here it's not that they just had some misinterpreted theology but they are they are living in a world where people have a form of godliness but deny the power and they Heap to themselves those preachers having itching ears that tell them what they want to hear and preach a version of The Gospel that's not their gospel but it's a version of The Gospel they want to be true and they follow it do you know something brother Brandon felt sorry for people under misinterpreted theology he did we and Brandon expressed that over and many many many times he was a Man Who Loved people and it broke his heart to see people and he would say open your eyes friends go back to the Bible and he would plead with them go back to the word so well my pastor says but what does the Bible say and then God would come on the scene in Mercy and prove what he was saying he was saying now if what I've said is the truth and what he had said was use your Bible don't believe somebody preaching something outside of the Bible and and it broke his heart that people would still make that choice and even you know the the sister um glattus or not or U I forget her name I think it was Sister glattus who was there in Louisiana when brother brandom is preaching choosing of a bride and I mean at the end brother brandom is just beside himself and the people are screaming and and and he's saying you know you know you know you need to repent and and and and and the end is upon us and California's going to go down and and people are screaming and I believe it was choosing of a bride there in Louisiana but it seemed like maybe he was there in California because he's saying repent Los Angeles so I might have the sermon titles inverted but it was all part of those last Closing Services of his life and she and and you can hear the audience people are wailing and screaming and brother brandham says you know I'm not like this I'm not given to this he says but I'm telling you something's about to happen and people are and you know what that and and they asked this sister I remember brother Bisal told us years ago said he I asked sister I think it was sister glattus said what was the response I can hear it on the tape but I wasn't there what was the response of the people she said half the people were on their faces on the ground screaming and crying and the other half and women with their high heeled shoes clicky clack their way out the door turned on their high heels and out they went said half the audience walked out immediately and half of them was on their faces screaming how do you get that kind of disparity I you know and brother Brandon would he felt very sorry for people who had had misinterpreted theology he expressed his regret that Jackie and and Jack Kennedy had maybe never got to hear one of his sermons but you know something that that did not occupy William bram's main feeling of Sorrow his his his primary sorrow wasn't that they hadn't heard a tape of his or that they uh that that they' had a misinterpreted theology but he said what what made him the most sorry was he felt sorry for the sinner amen who saw the hypocrisy of the Christian church and saw no difference between them and himself themselves he says that's the one I feel sorry for I feel sorry for the sinner who looks at that and doesn't know what to think doesn't know what to choose trying to find eternal life and don't even know where to start why I could go to those Christians they're no different from me I drink with those guys that's the truth I I remember I got a buddy who's uh in the message today and he was uh he was a Catholic and and he started his life started falling apart and somebody said to him well you need to go see a priest he says a priest he said I drink with those guys well why would I go see them they got the same problems I got he said I need to find somebody that that's that's different and he came across some Believers and his life was never the same see and and so a lot of times we can say you know you know oh I feel sorry for those people brother Jason you should have more Compassion maybe they've never heard the truth maybe they've never heard the message I don't deny that but could I throw in a little bit of of push back a little bit for balance sake why would God teach someone algebra if they've already refused his ABCs why would he even do that would you do that see they they he they they've already denied you know you you you don't just whatever you do don't go imputing God you cannot impune God he's always just he's always righteous he's always fair so you know this is where we have gotten to in the world and brother Brandon felt sorry for the sinner who looked at the confusion of it all and really you know didn't know what to do um brother Mark let's have my PowerPoint all right I've only got a few slides to show you and I'm not going to spend a great deal of time on this and here's the psych the Christian psychology part actually it's not even Christian psychology it's uh aristotlean psychology uh this word is has various spellings it also has various pronunciations depending on what scholar is saying it uh it's uh UD demonia or or udonia I've heard it pronounced both ways I prefer udonia that's the one I've heard most commonly and it it basically is happiness according to the Greeks all right now we read Jesus declaring to us in our scripture in John 16 that hither to you have asked me nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full all right now just stick with me for a minute all right so whoops so Yia is a term which comes from Aristotle's work called nicoman ethics and means individual well-being and happiness it combines the prefix EU meaning good and Damon meaning Spirit Socrates also delved into goodness and the virtues of knowledge leading us to a achieve the ultimate good all right so the word udia is an ancient Greek word that appears in many philosophical texts historically it has been translated as happiness in philosophical context though it can mean wealth Prosperity or Good Fortune however most modern historians claim that this is an inaccurate translation udonia is not an emotion it is it is more a constant state of being all right so I I just want that in your mind so this is this is wisdom versus Faith that's the pursuit of wisdom and I'm going to break it down for you a little bit further and I just ask for your patience because I really want to bring the comparison to you you stick with me so udia then is a concept from ancient Greek philosophy that refers in some cases to a state of flourishing or well-being or happiness that is achieved through living a virtuous life in the philosophy of Aristotle and and I've read many of his statements udonia was actually in his mind the ultimate goal of human existence all right so he believed that by pursuing virtue and excellence in all areas of your life a person could achieve a state of lasting happiness and fulfillment now I'm all for the pursuit of Excellence Jesus was a a man who pursued Excellence he said I do always that which pleases the father all right so it's a way of let now and this an important point so Aristotle was not just saying it's happy thoughts see and actually he believed that it was a way of life rather than just a momentary feeling of pleasure from I don't know some fortunate circumstance that you found yourself in or maybe some accomplishment that you had and you had that high of satisfaction he's saying you know you your diamond KN is more than that according to Aristotle virtue is the ability to reason properly and then act accordingly wi with that proper reasoning which then leads leads you to true happiness now this is all sensible stuff I'm not up here condemning it I'm going yeah pursuit of Excellence you know you you do good things you reap good things you have a purpose you have a drive brother Brandon had a bum come to his door that he fed him a meal and brother bram's trying to ask him a question where you from oh here and there where you going wherever well where do you live wherever I hang my hat oh come on man and brother Brandon was trying to say you know what's your purpose and the man said you know I just he didn't have one and brother brandham says whatever you do don't just don't be Driftwood life is precious it's valuable don't waste it I promise you it burns so fast already your life passes by at nuclear speed is just here today and gone tomorrow you're just a little Vapor you appear for a little while and then like a like a like you can look in the sky I preached years ago on a vapor trail I can look in the sky and I can see you know contrails from jets that have passed over I don't see the Jets they're already gone but I can see where they came from and I can see where they went to because the the one that's the most dispersed is the oldest and the one that's still tight is where they vanished into the Horizon so you know what kind of Trail are you leaving behind when people when you're gone and they see your life are they going to say are they going to look at your life and say he's in heaven how do you know cuz that's the way he went the his whole life he moved toward Heaven see so so it was the it's a it's a noble thing but but it falls short wisdom versus Faith wisdom of man though it has many noble Endeavors like brother Brandon would say when Jesus rose he said there had never been a man like him brother Brandon said there had been many good men there had been many good men who died for a good cause but there had never been a man a good man who died for the greatest cause and could lay his life down and then pick his own life back up again that had never happened see so so in Aristotle's view that's that's the way to get yourself to true and Lasting happiness Buddhism has some similars some similarities uh you know in Buddhism there's the idea of Enlightenment you know which involves letting go of of of of attachments and desires to where you achieve an an inner state of of inner peace and inner wisdom in Hinduism there's the idea of something called Maka which is The Liberation from the cycle of rebirth and suffering and you say well you know there there's there's always the tree of knowledge is a tree of Good and Evil you understand that's the that's the catch it it look it can look good say man that's pretty sensible we all desire that but as brother Brandon would say there's no way to achieve that only through Christ amen it's the only way to God is through Jesus Christ This is why a just God will raise the Heathen up in the Millennium who never heard the gospel so that he can have a chance see so so so this is Aristotle's View and and and his his proteges it was their View and they and you can see it in in that kind of um Greek uh wisdom you know so so we find that Jesus on the other hand would say that true happiness comes from a relationship with God Amen something Aristotle didn't include in his formula at all you just need to be a good person and and Excel in wisdom and knowledge and you'll have and that'll be the most satisfying life you can ever have you know the world is your oyster go get it and and you'll have a happy ending and that's just not true so Jesus comes along he's offering a completely different way that that true happiness only comes from a relationship with God though virtuous Behavior sure just like Aristotle says it's all about virtuous Behavior great that's awesome Jesus also preached ver virtuous Behavior but not just any virtuous Behavior it's a virtuous behavior that is inspired by faith in God that's the only real virtuous strength that that can make you acceptable in the Beloved is not that you went after wisdom wisdom versus faith faith wins every time see so for Jesus true happiness is found in surrendering to God's Will and living a life then that reflects God's love and God's grace that is taught in his word amen this is why the first and great commandment is to love God make him the center of your life he's your everything and then your life will be a life of Grace that you'll live among fellow men and then you will be uh in the perfect will and plan of God and that's virtuous and then by that you give virtue to those around you you don't weaken their faith by causing Confusion by by quoting this but living differently you're harming the world brother Brandon was so adamant about that that he said if you're not going to be a Christian stop calling yourself that cuz you're only make a confusion you're harming your fellow man you're not helping him I don't care how many hospitals you build for him and how many of bread lines you put him in you're you're harming him because you're you're you're not you're the greatest thing you can do I I said to the group in Swansea I wanted to repay their kindness to me and I got up on Sunday and I said you know the greatest thing I I want to somehow repay you all you've been so kind my accommodations the pull on the word has been so Wonder and I was driving to church today and I thought Lord what can I do for these people to show my gratitude and I thought to myself and I said this to them I said I thought to myself the greatest thing that I could do for you would be to Grant you eternal life however I don't have that kind of power it's not mine to give that would be the greatest thing I could do but since I can't do that what I can do is give you that which will lead you to eternal life I can do that I can give you the word and that's far better for you than if I give you $50 or $5,000 see so so we find then that that you know Jesus taught that it's a life that reflects God's love and God's grace as it's taught in the word otherwise you're harming the world Aristotle and Jesus were two for sure two of the most influential men that's ever lived in human history we we build our whole society today on aristotlean wisdom and Greek Greek knowledge and uh and so Aristotle and Jesus being two influential figures who have literally shaped the history of philosophy and religion and both of them uh have offered their viewpoints on what is udonia meaning happiness or well-being or or as Jesus would say that your joy may be full however how however their views differ significantly in terms of what constitutes these qualities and how they can be achieved for Aristotle he felt that udia is the highest human good and the ultimate goal of Life man's Wisdom and the practice of moral Behavior see so and and and as I've said it's it's not just a state of mind but it's an activity Aristotle actually believed in hearing recognizing and acting on his wisdom see so he defines virtue as a disposition to act in a rational and excellent way and to be balanced in your actions rejecting rashness Aristotle distinguishes between two kinds of virtue one he calls ethical virtue which involves moral character and emotions the other is intellectual virtue which involves wisdom and understanding this is this is similar to Abraham Lincoln saying that if you declare something to be true that you don't actually know is true then you have told a lie and he said that that's dishonesty at at the root level because you've told something as a matter of fact when as a matter of fact you don't know what you're talking about see and so he Aristotle had a high belief in ethical virtue morally and intellectually which involved wisdom and understanding showing you how to live a moral life and a life of character he argues that the highest forms it's okay he argues that the highest form of intellectual virtue is theoretical wisdom now we're coming to where brother Brandon preached wisdom versus Faith he he argued that intellectual wisdom was the highest form of intellectual virtue theoretical wisdom which consists of contemplating the most noble and divine things therefore he concluded that the most udic life is one that is to that is devoted to philosophical or scientific inquiry while also practicing ethical virtue and enjoying other Goods such as friendship pleasure and honor but for the the most radical teacher the world has ever had for Jesus Christ true happiness real contentment and and the fullness of joy are not worldly or human cont Concepts at all but they are a Divine gift and a promise from God and if you achieved them any other way you went around you you didn't come through the door and Jesus gives that Parable somebody crawled in with their aristotlean wisdom and got thrown out see so it's not something According To Jesus it's not something that can be achieved by human effort or reason it can only be achieved by grace and by faith Jesus teaches contrary to Aristotle that things are not at all dependent hear me hear me hear me there's a big point oh my and I know you're paying attention I'm just getting excited Jesus teaches that these things are not at all happiness contentment the fullness of joy you dimia Jesus teaches that they're not at all dependent on external circumstances or possessions but but it's based on one thing your relationship with God and obedience to his will oh I could that way I could dismiss we go home that's enough for you for the day has nothing to do with your accomplishments or or winning the Blue Ribbon it's not about how many how many zeros are in your bank account or how your education is that that's wisdom versus Faith choose Faith Jesus defines them as the Fulfillment of the law and the prophets which can be summed up in those two Commandments loving God with all your heart soul and mind and strength and love your neighbor as yourself it's not as we said two different things but the latter is the result of loving God fully he also Jesus actually in his in his teaching sets down on the mount one day and goes into teaching of Parables and he starts to we we call it the Beatitudes see and so in in the Beatitudes which describe now look how contrary this is to aristotlean uh udonia Jesus in his Beatitudes he describes the qualities and attitudes that lead to the fullness of joy for example he says that those who are poor in spirit Meek merciful pure in heart peacemakers persecuted for righteous Stakes for righteous sake those are the Blessed ones and those are the ones who will inherit the kingdom of God the Kingdom of Heaven therefore he concludes that the most fulfilled and joyful life is one that follows him as Messiah follows him as the Son of God and even follows him in the fellowship of his suffering being made conformable unto his death while also at the same time serving others and seeking God's kingdom Above All Else wisdom versus Faith make your choice today make your choice young people you're headed for a youth camp make your choice now don't wait two weeks from now amen so Aristotle's view is based on his rational and his empirical investigation of human nature and reality whereas the Lord's view is based on his Revelation and Authority as God incarnate who you going to follow Aristotle's view emphasizes human autonomy and Excellence while Jesus's view emphasizes divine grace Aristotle's View aims at achieving happiness in this life while Jesus's view aims at at attaining happiness in the Life to Come GL Hallelujah that's the one I'm interested in today so my my sermon today too if I were to be preaching to Aristotle himself had I lived back there I would have my sermon would have been that true and Lasting joy and happiness it's not something that can be attained through external means like material possessions or you know worldly success and but rather Aristotle I would say it comes from within it comes from spiritual growth it it grows one's character it is the cultivation of the Life of Christ within you as Jesus said in Luke 17:21 the kingdom of God is with within you so the fullness of joy is a spiritual reality not a psychological one amen you'll never get the fullness of joy on a college campus instruction I I'm all for pursuing Excellence but just know that I don't care what you ever achieve in this life the fullness of joy is not going to be how many zeros are in your bank account that's not where it comes from the fullness of joy is not how many likes you have and clicks you have it's not that's not where it comes from that is so shallow so flimsy life moves by so quick at the speed of light this is exactly why that th this is exactly why and you've heard me teach them this before that when Jesus comes there in Matthew 16 and he says to them who do you who do men say I am they said well some Jeremiah Elias are one of the prophets he said well who do you say they said well you're Christ son of the Living God God and Jesus says blessed art thou Simon say blessed and and and Dr zoda's in his in his lexical Aid always took exception to that being translated as happy or fortunate he says not that it's not blessed in the Greek doesn't mean happier Fort that's aristotlean influence that's what they think of blessed means happy and fortunate you know but but but real the fullness of joy isn't isn't based on external things it's not based on accomplishments or possessions it it's based on a surrendered life that that lays its life on the cross beside of Christ and is willing to say Lord remember me when you enter into your kingdom so so and and Dr zod's always took exception to that he says what it literally means Is possessing the characteristic of deity I thought how Wonder have you ever heard brother R say a c genene cuz that's exactly what he's saying that word means Simon that this is how you recognize me because we have a common father we're K this is how I say thou art Peter this is how I know who you are that's how you know who I am that's why nobody can shake it from you because it's not it's not wisdom it's a it's an identity based on your inheritance based on a gene of God I'm here to tell you something friends I don't know the world can identify as this and identify as animals and identify as the opposite gender I identify as a spiritual being having a natural experience I identify that I came from God I'm going back to God I identify that we're kin folk and he's my father how do you know cuz I love his word and it consumes my life there's no other Pursuit worth anything besides that oh my so so from the perspective of a humanistic view of aristotlean wisdom and knowledge of Christ then you know if Aristotle was looking at at that verse he would say as many Greek Scholars as Dr zod's do Zodi said they misinterpret it Aristotle would do that he would look on it as happiness or he would look on it as being fortunate but from the perspective of revelation of the spirit it's much higher see it represents an identity oh my friends I am not here I'm G to close today I'm not hardly got hardly got going in this sermon I'm GNA stop I want to just make this statement but Anthony come bring your team I am not here and I hope you are not here to chase contentment or riches from a broken world this world is not my home I'm just passing through that's right my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue why don't you stand with me I want you I want to say this again I've got three lines I want to give you and I'll try to stop I'm not here to chase contentment from the world I'm not here to chase riches from this broken world I my whole life is dedicated to one purpose and that is laying up Treasures beyond the stars someday I'll be drawing benefits from them as I sail right past them Same Stars friends you can't imagine what's just on the other side and we are so close to it we are so close to it i' I'd need at least another hour or maybe an hour and a half to finish my sermon so I'm not going to attempt it we are so close bow your heads with [Music] me Lord I promised you I would just I determined Lord by your permission that I would go as far as I felt to go and when you gave me the nudge I would I would just stop so much more to say so much more I Des desire to say but I pray Lord God that enough was said today and I believe it was that it it it if it doesn't do anything Lord it was in a very provocative way to to provoke people to thinking that's that's what preaching does if it's successful it provokes thought it provokes introspection and and and in that sense it's always to be provocative in that way it's not just I'm not just up here as an information Source I'm not an AI and I'm not a not here just to as a newsman I I'm here to provoke people to thinking deeply a sermon is successful no matter its content no matter how long or how brief it might be its success is based on the fact that does it get people to think on their ways Lord we saw such a an astonishing display of that last Wednesday night and we had a brother who just preached I I don't even know if he preached 30 minutes and one after another after another after another after another after another came forward from prayer why Lord because as our brother said I just I just preached what the lord gave me and it worked it it it didn't have to be hours long it worked he he didn't have to run all over the building and have and have States presence and lights and and pyate Technics it worked it reached the heart of people and they had a response to the word of God I pray for such a response today Lord the altars always open people are always welcome to come for prayer that's any time it's anyone can come today for prayer but if no one comes I will gauge Lord the success of this service just knowing that this has caused people to pause and think deeply go back and maybe now you you'll have an interest to go back and hear God's Prophet preach wisdom versus Faith they are millenniums apart wisdom and Faith one is so human it it has good because it's a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it has good embedded in it but it's a trick it's a trap to keep them from the real and brother Bram said why would you take a substitute when the heavens are full of the real why would you just take human philosophy however brilliant it may sound why would you accept the agenda of of the world rather than give your whole life over to the one who has built the next one and has a spot for you there oh Lord God I pray you'll move on Hearts young and old today I commit it to you now in Jesus name sing brother Anthony [Music] make he's already said that I would I keep on trusting that he's working everything for my good he walks
