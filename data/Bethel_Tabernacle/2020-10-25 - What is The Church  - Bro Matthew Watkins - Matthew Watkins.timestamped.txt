[0:31] [Music]
[0:51] like to just
[0:52] teach this morning take a few scriptures
[0:54] and i'd like to teach
[0:56] uh this morning on what is the church
[0:58] amen what is the church
[1:00] and i'd like to just begin here
[1:03] with matthew 16 a very familiar passage
[1:07] and uh i think that it's um
[1:10] i think it's a keynote scripture for us
[1:13] for what we believe
[1:14] and jesus answered and said unto him
[1:16] blessed are thou
[1:17] simon barjona for flesh and blood hath
[1:20] not revealed it unto thee
[1:22] but my father which is in heaven and i
[1:25] say also
[1:26] unto thee that thou art peter and upon
[1:29] this rock
[1:30] i will build my church and the gates of
[1:32] hell shall not
[1:34] prevail against it you can be seated
[1:36] this morning
[1:38] jesus said unto peter i will build my
[1:41] church so one thing that we could
[1:44] establish
[1:45] right here from matthew chapter 16 that
[1:47] i think is a
[1:48] very important distinction uh
[1:51] because the church has been defined by
[1:54] many through many ages and church
[1:59] leaders and church bishops and
[2:01] theologians of what the church is
[2:04] and today we have an entire church
[2:06] system that is based around
[2:09] salvation it's based around repentance
[2:12] and those are all
[2:14] true things and definitely things that
[2:16] are part of the church
[2:17] but what jesus said he was coming to do
[2:20] was more
[2:21] than to save people right and a lot of
[2:24] times we define
[2:25] what jesus came to do when he came into
[2:28] the earth as he was coming to save
[2:30] individuals but actually he was he
[2:33] wasn't coming to save individuals he was
[2:35] coming to build a church
[2:37] now it would include salvation it'd
[2:39] include redemption
[2:40] it'd include repentance baptism but he
[2:43] didn't just come to save individuals
[2:45] he came to do what he said and that is
[2:49] i will build my church
[2:52] and so what we what we know first
[2:56] is that a church is not a building and
[2:59] you may point to a building
[3:00] uh today and say i go to that church you
[3:03] may
[3:04] you may drive with someone down mossy
[3:05] oak road and say there's my church
[3:08] but you know we could say that's the
[3:10] church that i go to
[3:12] but actually that's not the church that
[3:14] you go to
[3:16] that's not the church at all this is
[3:17] just a building
[3:19] and uh and it's a it's a it's a building
[3:21] made by men
[3:22] and it houses us it puts us in a place
[3:24] with a
[3:25] an a spot where we can identify a place
[3:28] of assembly where we all
[3:30] meet this is where we all meet it's our
[3:32] meeting house
[3:34] but this house could change tomorrow it
[3:36] could change
[3:38] there's nothing at all
[3:41] holy about the building
[3:44] physically now it's not as we've said
[3:47] many times before it's nothing to do
[3:49] with the pews or
[3:50] or the music that we play or the the
[3:53] scent
[3:53] uh a fragrance that we use that makes a
[3:56] building holy
[3:57] it's not even um it's not even any part
[4:00] of any
[4:00] any mechanical function that we do but
[4:03] what makes it holy
[4:04] is who dwells here and that's jesus
[4:07] christ
[4:08] that's what makes it holy as far as the
[4:11] building goes this building could be
[4:13] we could sell it and they could use it
[4:14] for a strip club they could use it for
[4:16] you know a nightclub they could use it
[4:18] for a bar
[4:20] then what happens to the building the
[4:21] building was always just a building it's
[4:23] a place of assembly
[4:25] and so as we said a chur the church is
[4:27] not a building
[4:28] and and and and that we point to and say
[4:31] that's the church
[4:32] that i go to but the church is the
[4:34] people
[4:37] that's the church and whether it meets
[4:39] in a building
[4:40] whether they meet in a tent or whether
[4:43] they meet outside in the open
[4:45] air it's still the church
[4:48] brother branham says and i didn't have
[4:50] time to put these on the screen so
[4:51] you'll just have to listen close brother
[4:52] branham says here and why we are not of
[4:54] the nomination but did you ever notice
[4:57] that every time a church
[4:58] ever fails as soon as they denominate
[5:01] they start
[5:02] failing right then and whenever they
[5:05] fail
[5:06] god never raises that church again so
[5:09] what is
[5:10] the what is the sure method to
[5:14] killing a church denomination and
[5:17] denomination we know is not
[5:19] is not uh you don't ever find a
[5:21] nomination in the bible you find that
[5:23] men made they did not the word
[5:25] denominate means to separate means to
[5:28] self-identify and so they've named it
[5:31] many different denominations that
[5:33] they've that they've given it but that's
[5:34] not
[5:34] that's not the church the church is the
[5:36] is the body of jesus christ
[5:38] brother adam says here in the same
[5:40] message he says god
[5:42] deals with because when we think of a
[5:44] church we think of a collection of
[5:46] people and it is
[5:47] but you have to be careful how you look
[5:49] at a group and
[5:52] uh uh and and and the difference between
[5:54] a group and an in an
[5:55] individual to god means a lot right
[5:58] brother baron would go on to say that
[6:00] the way that god dealt with israel was
[6:02] as a group
[6:03] he dealt with him as a nation but he
[6:05] said the way that he deals with the new
[6:07] testament church
[6:08] is individuals so he said brother matt
[6:11] does that mean god doesn't have a group
[6:13] no it's not what it means at all but
[6:15] it's how he
[6:16] builds that group or establishes that
[6:18] group is he
[6:20] comes to individual hearts
[6:23] brother adam says god deals with
[6:25] individuals
[6:26] not with the nomination god in no age
[6:30] ever dealt with the denomination he's
[6:32] always dealt
[6:33] with an individual in the old testament
[6:36] brother adam begins to give this type
[6:38] here that in the
[6:39] old covenant he dealt with a nation a
[6:41] group
[6:42] but today he's dealing in the hearts of
[6:45] people
[6:46] so we can't emphasize this one point
[6:48] enough
[6:49] there is no safety in numbers
[6:55] there's no safety in putting your name
[6:58] on a book
[6:59] that doesn't make you a member there's
[7:02] no safety in the family
[7:04] natural human family that you're part of
[7:06] there there is a lot you see brother
[7:07] matt there's a lot there's a lot of
[7:08] safeties i'm just talking about
[7:09] salvation as far as your
[7:11] eternal soul brother and says here in
[7:14] the same message he says
[7:16] i said in the in the infallibility of
[7:19] the catholic church
[7:21] why has it changed so much he said well
[7:24] see you all believe the bible we believe
[7:27] the church this is a
[7:28] catholic person speaking to him we don't
[7:31] care what the bible says it's what the
[7:32] church
[7:33] says that's exactly right you ever come
[7:36] brother adam says you ever come to a
[7:38] showdown try it once
[7:40] see they don't care what the bible says
[7:44] that has nothing to do with it they care
[7:47] what the church says
[7:50] we don't care what the church says we
[7:52] believe what brother adam says but we
[7:54] don't care
[7:55] what the church says we believe what god
[7:57] says
[7:59] for the bible says let every man's word
[8:01] be a lie
[8:02] and mind be the truth and then he says
[8:05] that's why
[8:06] we're not a denomination amen so
[8:09] in order to find out what is the church
[8:12] very simple
[8:13] teaching here this morning we need to
[8:15] define what the church
[8:16] is not what it's clearly not
[8:20] what it's absolutely not what it's in no
[8:22] way shape or form
[8:24] what the church is not is the church
[8:27] is not a business
[8:31] so many churches today are ran like a
[8:33] modern business and
[8:34] and you can run a business good and
[8:36] there's good practices good
[8:38] biblical practices on how to run a
[8:40] business
[8:41] but the church is not a business and
[8:44] some churches copy even if even to the
[8:46] very foundation of of how business pro
[8:49] of how
[8:50] a worldly business runs itself a church
[8:52] will take those same models and
[8:53] principles
[8:54] and and build it the same exact way even
[8:57] even church projects when they go to do
[8:58] a new church project you ran it
[9:00] now i could say of course a church has
[9:03] to be ran in some ways like
[9:04] its finance has to be ran properly
[9:08] and it has to have good practices and
[9:10] there's and there's definitely business
[9:12] matters that a church responsibilities
[9:15] business matters that a church takes
[9:17] uh part in and has to there's some
[9:18] things that a church has to involve
[9:20] themselves
[9:22] in just to be able to function uh you
[9:24] know we have to we have to abide by
[9:26] certain
[9:26] municipality rules and regulations here
[9:29] how we run
[9:30] so in some ways we're governed by those
[9:31] things but we don't we understand that
[9:33] the church that jesus said in matthew 16
[9:35] i'll build
[9:36] my church he wasn't building the
[9:38] business
[9:40] it wasn't about getting rich it wasn't
[9:42] about money at all it was about
[9:43] souls right so
[9:46] it it it shouldn't be because the here's
[9:49] why i said brother matt why
[9:50] because the church is not an
[9:52] organization
[9:54] right the church is not in no way
[9:58] an organization it's not an organization
[10:01] it's an organism
[10:05] that was a good point that was one of my
[10:08] power points
[10:10] the church is not an organization it's
[10:12] an organism
[10:14] meaning that it's it's a living body
[10:18] it's not a dead building it's not a dead
[10:20] group of of of elders and trustees and
[10:22] deacons and pastors and
[10:24] that's not what it is it's not a group
[10:26] of men it's not an organization that
[10:28] we've organized
[10:29] it's an organism the church that jesus
[10:31] said he was coming to
[10:32] build was something that lived
[10:37] right the church is also not a club
[10:42] it's not a club and i'm talking about
[10:45] like a nightclub i'm talking about a
[10:46] club like uh
[10:48] yeah exactly like it's not it's not it's
[10:51] not a group it's not a local chapter or
[10:53] a club that and you can join those
[10:55] you know they have veterans clubs and
[10:57] veterans will join them and they'll find
[10:59] camaraderie
[11:00] with with the club it's not it's not you
[11:02] say well then it's a religious club no
[11:03] it's a lot of
[11:04] a lot of churches have made it a
[11:07] religious club and people
[11:08] join it like they join a religious club
[11:11] but the church that jesus is referring
[11:13] to is
[11:14] not a religious club at all so so many
[11:17] and
[11:17] and people joined churches today and you
[11:19] do you hear that well
[11:20] you know we went and i was at a church
[11:22] just recently it was a big baptist
[11:23] church and they had a
[11:24] they had a wooden board and that said
[11:26] members and it literally had a numeric
[11:29] number for how many members
[11:31] uh were in the church and that's how
[11:32] they that's how they view
[11:35] church and it was like you joined a club
[11:37] in a club you pay your yearly dues
[11:40] you join it you join the club you pay
[11:42] your yearly dues you have your
[11:44] membership
[11:45] subscription and and you you attend all
[11:48] the business meetings you
[11:49] vote and your vote means something you
[11:51] have a roll call
[11:54] you have a roll call at clubs make sure
[11:56] you're there make sure your vote counts
[11:58] but let me just say this that's not a
[12:00] church
[12:02] and a church shouldn't think like that
[12:06] we don't want the will of men voting we
[12:08] want the will of god
[12:11] we want what god wants uh what else the
[12:14] church is not the church is not a club
[12:16] the church is not a business the church
[12:18] is not
[12:19] the clergy this is a really important
[12:23] one right here
[12:24] the church is not the clergy it's not
[12:27] the leadership oh what is the church
[12:29] well it's
[12:30] it's the it's the preachers no no it's
[12:33] not
[12:33] it's amazing how many people view the
[12:36] church and when they think of the church
[12:37] they think of
[12:38] the clergy or the ministry and the
[12:40] catholic churches went really heavy in
[12:41] that what is the church
[12:42] it's the the you know the palpacy it's
[12:45] the pope then from there it's the
[12:46] bishops and the arch
[12:47] archbishops and they think of the entire
[12:50] structure of the churches by
[12:52] um the the saying the old saiyan is the
[12:55] sage
[12:55] on the stage
[13:00] but that's not the church
[13:03] the church and people say oh boy you
[13:06] know the the uh
[13:08] you know the the ch you know that you
[13:10] have the famous state boy the church
[13:11] ought to do something about that
[13:13] people love to say that you know that in
[13:15] our day it's the you know the preachers
[13:16] boy the preachers ought to do something
[13:17] about that thank god for preachers
[13:20] thank god for preachers who preach the
[13:21] truth thank god for pastors who preach
[13:23] the truth
[13:24] and rightly divide uh the word but
[13:27] oftentimes when people say the church
[13:28] ought to do something they're saying you
[13:30] preachers ought to do something
[13:32] we're paying our ties aren't we
[13:35] thank god for preachers but god's
[13:37] looking for the manifestation of the
[13:39] sons and the daughters of god
[13:41] the whole body can you say amen and it's
[13:45] and it's and and so many times we wait
[13:47] everything's being
[13:48] we're waiting for someone out here
[13:51] waiting for something out here to happen
[13:53] but but it's i just let me say this it's
[13:55] time for believers to come to their
[13:56] position
[13:58] and stop waiting for some future thing
[14:00] to happen
[14:01] god is moving in his church
[14:05] right now i said this last wednesday
[14:07] that i preached
[14:08] god is moving whether you feel him or
[14:10] not
[14:13] god is speaking right now
[14:16] whether you hear him whether i hear him
[14:18] or not
[14:19] god's speaking i say lord let me hear
[14:22] you
[14:24] so the church is not a building it's not
[14:26] an organization it's not a business it's
[14:28] not a club
[14:29] it's not the clergy say then what is it
[14:32] brother matt you've noted you've labeled
[14:34] all the things that it's not well let's
[14:36] let's find out what it what the bible
[14:38] calls the church
[14:39] one of the first things that the bible
[14:41] calls the church
[14:43] is a family got your attention
[14:48] hebrews chapter 2 turned there in your
[14:50] bible use your bible if you have it if
[14:51] you don't we'll have it on the screen
[14:52] hebrews chapter 2.
[14:54] let's start reading the verse 10.
[14:57] hebrews 2 nothing don't have a screen
[15:02] that's all right so good we got we got
[15:05] the wrestling of the leaves people's
[15:07] bibles turning
[15:09] hebrews chapter 2 verse 10 for it became
[15:11] him for whom all
[15:13] for whom are all things and by whom are
[15:16] all things listen to this
[15:17] bringing many sons to glory
[15:21] to make the captain of their salvation
[15:23] perfect through their through sufferings
[15:25] notice verse 11 for both he that
[15:28] sanctifieth
[15:29] and those and they who are sanctified
[15:32] are all one for which calls
[15:36] he is not ashamed to be called to call
[15:38] them brethren
[15:40] saying i would declare thy name unto thy
[15:42] brethren in the midst of the church
[15:44] while i sing praises unto thee so what
[15:47] is the bible
[15:48] we could read we could we could read
[15:50] five or six scriptures on this but just
[15:51] to save time
[15:53] the bible calls the church a family and
[15:56] it's
[15:56] literally you say what family the family
[15:58] of jesus christ
[16:00] that's what family name we have the
[16:03] whole
[16:04] family in heaven the bible says is named
[16:06] after him
[16:07] jesus christ that's the whole which the
[16:09] whole family is named
[16:11] so it's it's it's really the true family
[16:15] it's really what family really is
[16:19] the world modern world today has defined
[16:22] family what family is
[16:25] and a lot of times we get our influences
[16:27] of what family is not from the scripture
[16:29] but from hollywood
[16:30] what a perversion what a perversion
[16:35] but a real family the real family is the
[16:38] family of jesus christ can you say amen
[16:40] this morning
[16:41] you know um another description we could
[16:44] we could spend time on that it's a
[16:46] family
[16:46] it's it's a it's a real family you have
[16:49] unity in a family
[16:50] of harmony in a family another
[16:52] description the bible gives the church
[16:54] is a flock and the bible calls it this
[16:58] it's a flock you turn to hebrews chapter
[16:59] 13
[17:00] very important scripture hebrews chapter
[17:02] 13 verse
[17:03] 17 hebrews 13
[17:07] or 17 it says
[17:10] obey them that have the rule over you
[17:13] and submit yourselves
[17:15] for they watch for your souls
[17:19] as they that must give an account that
[17:21] they may do it with joy and not with
[17:22] grief
[17:23] for that is unprofitable for you
[17:26] so it says submit yourself for the
[17:28] speaking of pastors here speaking of
[17:30] leaders
[17:30] those that have the rule over you submit
[17:32] yourself for they watch over your soul
[17:35] so the bible all through the scriptures
[17:37] through the gospels and through the
[17:39] through the apostle paul's writings all
[17:41] the way through the new testament
[17:43] it identifies the church as a flock and
[17:46] and and quite literally in that way we
[17:49] are a flock
[17:50] of sheep we're a flock of sheep that's
[17:53] what the bible types us as that we're
[17:55] we're we're a flock of sheep and sheep
[17:57] are under under a shepherd and they're
[18:00] they're and and that shepherd's under
[18:02] the good shepherd
[18:04] but we're we're sheep and you know sheep
[18:06] have a tendency to get out of line
[18:08] they they it's in their natural it's
[18:10] it's part of their makeup they get out
[18:12] of order they they don't i shift you
[18:14] i'm talking naturally here about the
[18:15] animal it doesn't stay it doesn't just
[18:17] automatically stay in a group or stay in
[18:19] line it has a
[18:20] has its own has wants to have its own
[18:21] mind and its own way
[18:23] and and the bible says we like sheep
[18:26] have all gone astray
[18:28] and so it's part of our makeup that we
[18:32] go astray and so
[18:33] so it takes a shepherd amen and that's
[18:35] why you have a pastor that's why you
[18:37] have the preaching of the word of god to
[18:38] keep you
[18:39] on track to guide you safely
[18:42] can you say amen uh you watch a shepherd
[18:46] uh today and and and i was just hearing
[18:48] a man
[18:49] earlier this morning hearing a a a uh
[18:51] person describe
[18:52] a shepherd the role of a shepherd
[18:56] and sheep and it was amazing because he
[18:58] talked about the differences he said if
[18:59] you look at
[19:00] modern if you look at uh and you know
[19:03] even in our nation in north america at
[19:05] shepherd and he said it's very different
[19:07] than how if you go today to the middle
[19:09] east and you watch a shepherd
[19:10] with sheep and he said it's so so very
[19:13] different he said
[19:14] you know today they it's it's it's uh uh
[19:17] you know and he was giving the
[19:18] description hell in north america how
[19:19] that they
[19:20] uh a shepherd treats a sheep and he uses
[19:23] sheep dogs
[19:25] and he takes dogs to herd the sheep and
[19:27] to move the sheep he says but over in
[19:28] the middle east he said there's
[19:30] they don't have they don't use sheepdogs
[19:33] he says that the shepherd
[19:35] is the dog he's the one who's hurting
[19:38] he's the one who's calling he's the one
[19:39] who's keeping in the little in
[19:41] in order any any and he says and he has
[19:44] a
[19:44] um and he says he has a crook and that
[19:48] crook that is a is a tool it's like a
[19:50] long
[19:50] beam with a hook at the end and he says
[19:52] that's for
[19:53] pulling the sheet back to grab them by
[19:55] the neck and he says to pull them back
[19:57] in order when they get out of order
[19:59] and he says you know the think of david
[20:01] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[20:03] he maketh me
[20:05] and and so he's he leadeth me he maketh
[20:07] me it's it's the shepherd doing
[20:09] everything
[20:09] not an animal not a dog uh like over
[20:12] here but it's the shepherd himself
[20:14] and he and he says and he says he has
[20:16] two tools he has a crook
[20:18] and he says that's to pull the sheep
[20:19] back in line and he also has a dagger
[20:22] and he says that's to wilt off
[20:24] uh the enemy the wild beasts the animals
[20:27] and he says that's the two
[20:28] tools of the shepherd he's always
[20:30] pulling in order and he's always
[20:31] defending
[20:32] i thought it was a beautiful type of
[20:33] what a shepherd is because jesus says i
[20:36] am the good shepherd
[20:37] i lay my life down for the sheep and
[20:40] brother branham typed that and he says
[20:42] jesus says i am the door of the
[20:44] sheepfold
[20:45] and brother branham says i never
[20:46] understood what that meant i'm the door
[20:48] of the sheepfold
[20:49] and he says till i went over there in
[20:51] the middle east and he said i seen the
[20:52] shepherd and he would take all the sheep
[20:54] and he'd gather them into the pin
[20:56] and he says then there was no door
[20:58] there's just a pin open
[20:59] and he says and then the shepherd laid
[21:01] down
[21:02] and he went to sleep and he literally
[21:04] was the door
[21:06] in other words nothing was going to come
[21:08] in unless he let it in
[21:09] nothing was going to go out unless he
[21:11] let it out and jesus says
[21:13] i'm the door to the sheepfold i leave
[21:16] i lay my lifetail the the church is also
[21:22] a fellowship the bible speaks of this in
[21:25] john 1
[21:26] first john 1 really familiar scripture
[21:29] and it's
[21:30] this is this is uh this is a word that
[21:32] the bible uses
[21:33] very differently than how what we call
[21:37] fellowship we think of fellowship today
[21:38] if you've in in
[21:40] any church um you know we we we like to
[21:43] say let's have fellowship
[21:45] and you know we we announced this
[21:47] morning that the fellowship polls open
[21:49] um so free free announcement the
[21:50] fellowship was open um
[21:53] but it's we think a fellowship as we're
[21:54] going to go in the fellowship paul and
[21:56] we're going to have
[21:56] you know have coffee and you don't like
[21:58] coffee you're going to have tea
[22:00] and uh and you know we think of that
[22:01] that's that that's fellowship
[22:03] you know what's interesting is that you
[22:04] never you never say to one of your
[22:06] business associates hey let's go have
[22:08] fellowship
[22:11] you never say to one of your friends you
[22:12] know hey let's have some felt you know
[22:14] you only say that when it's
[22:15] the church right at least i hope that's
[22:18] all you use it for
[22:20] you know you don't say to a person
[22:21] you're trying to sell a you know uh hey
[22:23] let me have product let me have
[22:24] fellowship on this product with you
[22:26] what do you mean fellowship so when we
[22:29] and
[22:29] and sometimes we we use a word so much
[22:31] it becomes common to us and i thought it
[22:33] was
[22:34] so amazing i was astounded by this this
[22:35] morning let's look at first john
[22:37] chapter one verse three jesus and notice
[22:40] i want you to yeah
[22:41] good we have it on the screen that's
[22:42] perfect first john 1
[22:45] it says that which we have seen and
[22:47] heard declare we unto you that you also
[22:50] may have fellowship
[22:51] with us and truly our fellowship
[22:55] is with the father and with the son
[22:56] jesus christ and these things
[22:59] right we unto you that your joy may be
[23:01] full
[23:02] this then is the message which we have
[23:04] heard of him and declare unto you that
[23:06] god is lighter than him when there's no
[23:07] darkness
[23:08] at all if we say we have fellowship
[23:11] coffee tea you know snacks no that's not
[23:15] what it's talking about at all
[23:17] if we say that we have fellowship with
[23:19] him
[23:20] and walk in darkness we lie and do not
[23:23] the truth
[23:24] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[23:26] the light we have fellowship one with
[23:28] another
[23:28] and the blood of jesus christ cleanses
[23:30] us from all sin
[23:32] kanona i think i'm pronouncing that
[23:34] right is the greek
[23:36] word that the bible uses here
[23:40] when it speaks of fellowship and it uses
[23:42] it and and more than first john you
[23:44] could
[23:45] you we could we could uh speak about the
[23:47] fellowship of his sufferings we could uh
[23:50] you know uh we there's many scriptures
[23:52] that speak of this word kanoina
[23:54] it's translated you you find it in in
[23:57] acts chapter 2 verse 42. you don't have
[23:59] to turn
[24:00] and you'll remember this scripture when
[24:02] i quote it and they devoted themselves
[24:04] to the apostles teaching
[24:07] and to fellowship and to the breaking of
[24:10] bread and prayer speaking of the new
[24:11] testament church canoina
[24:13] and so that same word and it's so
[24:15] amazing how very different the word
[24:17] fellowship
[24:18] is used in the bible than how we have
[24:21] commonly used fellowship as
[24:22] you know the the you know the funny
[24:24] thing it's two fellows in the ship
[24:26] all of that's good all of that's great
[24:28] you know we get together we have
[24:30] fellowship
[24:30] but what is real fellowship you know
[24:32] it's actually
[24:34] used for siamese twins
[24:38] kanoona siamese twins have conoyna
[24:42] because twins and i want you to think of
[24:45] this when you think
[24:46] when the bible says we have fellowship
[24:49] one with another what's it saying we
[24:51] have kanoina
[24:53] one with another we have something in
[24:55] common
[24:56] that's what it's that's what it means
[24:58] when it says we have fellowship we have
[24:59] something in common
[25:01] you may have nothing in common we may
[25:03] sit outside here and we may
[25:04] fellowship and we find out we have
[25:07] nothing in common you like
[25:08] golfing i don't i like hunting you don't
[25:11] like hunting
[25:12] you know you like sweet tea and i don't
[25:14] i like unsweet tea
[25:16] we may have nothing in common but we
[25:18] have one thing in common when we start
[25:20] talking about the word of god
[25:22] then we have fellowship and it doesn't
[25:25] mean we have conversation it doesn't
[25:27] mean we have
[25:28] dialogue it means we have something in
[25:31] common
[25:32] think of the church as it was
[25:34] established from all parts of the jews
[25:36] and the gentiles and
[25:37] samaritan all of the entire world they
[25:40] were so
[25:40] very different but yet god was going to
[25:43] give them
[25:43] fellowship by what the holy spirit
[25:47] amen and through the holy ghost there
[25:50] would be
[25:51] canona so awesome when you think of this
[25:53] because it's used for
[25:55] siamese twins you know what a siamese
[25:56] twin is those that are
[25:58] joined together at birth now think of
[26:01] this
[26:02] when you think of fellowship one with
[26:04] another what fellowship do we have with
[26:06] each other why are we here gathered in
[26:08] the building together
[26:09] what is fellowship a siamese twin
[26:12] has kanoina because they're born
[26:16] a siamese twin is joined together at
[26:19] birth
[26:20] they share the same bloodstream
[26:25] a lot of times they share the same
[26:26] organs
[26:29] notice this is what it means when it
[26:31] says we're part of a fellowship
[26:33] it's not drinking coffee it's that we
[26:36] have something one
[26:36] in common one with the other we're
[26:39] sharing something together
[26:42] we're sharing life together
[26:45] they share the same organs sometimes in
[26:47] fact
[26:48] um one of the most difficult surgeries
[26:51] that can that you that can take place
[26:53] one of the most difficult surgeries
[26:55] is to separate a siamese twin
[26:58] to separate them sometimes it can't be
[27:00] done sometimes it's impossible because
[27:02] of what all they share
[27:03] so the bible says that we have
[27:05] fellowship we have
[27:07] what is a church don't forget my topic
[27:09] here what is the church it's a
[27:10] it's a it's a it's a it's a fellowship
[27:14] and it means it has canon it has
[27:16] something in common it shares
[27:18] the bible says that we have canonif we
[27:20] have fellowship
[27:21] in the spirit that because i have the
[27:25] same holy ghost and you have the holy
[27:26] ghost then we can have
[27:28] fellowship i thought you know um my dad
[27:31] said the other day and it was so
[27:32] wonderful because he said you get around
[27:33] believers haven't you ever noticed and i
[27:35] forget the context in which you said it
[27:36] but he said
[27:37] sometimes you feel closer to the family
[27:39] of god than your own family
[27:41] and you think that's odd you know that's
[27:42] not odd it's actually very normal
[27:45] because you have kanona you're sharing
[27:47] something you're sharing the same
[27:48] bloodstream you're sharing the same
[27:49] organs
[27:50] you're the same source of life comes
[27:52] from the same exact place
[27:53] we have something in common you could go
[27:55] if you've never experienced it you go
[27:56] overseas
[27:57] somewhere and you don't know who's
[27:59] picking you up you don't know who's
[28:00] who's there you don't know who you'll
[28:01] meet but man in five minutes time it's
[28:03] like i've known this person my whole
[28:04] life
[28:06] it's that's that's because you have
[28:08] fellowship one with another
[28:10] it's the same holy spirit flowing
[28:13] through all of us
[28:15] and and it would it would take a
[28:16] surgical operation to separate us
[28:21] yeah because we have fellowship one with
[28:25] the other can you say amen
[28:28] you know what it's also you know what
[28:30] it's not fellowship is not friendship
[28:34] friends are good but let me just say
[28:36] this fellowship is deeper than
[28:38] friendship
[28:39] it goes further than friendship it's
[28:41] it's more sacred than friendship
[28:44] it's it's it's much it's a much cannon
[28:46] it's a much stronger word when you look
[28:48] up that greek word
[28:49] and it exists only between those who
[28:52] have the spirit only those who have the
[28:56] holy spirit there's a fellowship one
[28:58] with the other we're out of time
[28:59] let's all stand to our feet lord jesus
[29:02] we thank you for the
[29:04] word that we've read this morning means
[29:06] so much to us lord
[29:08] it's it's part of us lord we identify
[29:10] with it we just ask
[29:12] that you would take the words that we've
[29:13] spoken this morning may you establish it

[29:18] of this service the preaching of the
[29:19] word
