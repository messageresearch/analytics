[29:21] of it a little as we go but we got we
[29:23] don't have to be in a breakneck hurry
[29:25] but i mean just how it is works for us

[29:57] relevance to us in our day we want to
[29:59] look at numbers 13.
[30:01] just want to take two verses
[30:03] people who listen to a lot of tapes will
[30:06] recognize this as the text brother
[30:08] branham took
[30:10] in the time of decision
[30:12] he preached that
[30:14] several times power of decision time of
[30:16] decision
[30:17] and preached it four or five times it
[30:20] was an important topic to him amen
[30:24] a lot of decisions to be made
[30:26] in life today life comes at you quick
[30:29] and there's a lot of decisions that have
[30:31] to be made and are being made and we
[30:34] want to make sure that you know that
[30:36] we're making the right ones and the best
[30:38] way to do that is to you know see the
[30:41] whole see the whole field see see
[30:43] everything and uh
[30:45] look at it uh in its entirety and i
[30:48] think that god has given us a wonderful
[30:51] reality in this day
[30:53] um you know where we have uh literally
[30:56] come to the end of not knowing amen the
[31:00] seals have been opened the book is
[31:02] opened that we know now we know so many
[31:05] things that they wondered at through the
[31:08] ages and we don't have to wonder at them
[31:10] anymore we've had the original
[31:12] understanding restored back to us so
[31:15] thanks be to god
[31:17] numbers 13

[31:31] moses and said
[31:33] let us go up at once and possess it
[31:36] for we are well able to overcome it
[31:39] verse 31
[31:41] but the men that were
[31:42] that went up with him said
[31:45] we be not able to go up against the
[31:48] people for they are stronger than we

[33:10] finding
[33:11] god's
[33:12] current and i'm taking
[33:15] for a subtitle
[33:17] i think i hit this one
[33:20] the power
[33:21] of decision
[33:23] finding god's current now what i mean by
[33:24] god's current okay i want you to think
[33:27] about currents in the ocean
[33:29] you know there's currents in the jet
[33:30] stream
[33:32] and uh you know there it's it's not easy
[33:34] to swim against the current amen and you
[33:38] know there is a
[33:39] there is a uh a way the bible says that
[33:43] seemeth right to a man i could say it to
[33:45] you tonight there is a current that
[33:47] seems like the way to swim
[33:50] but the end thereof is is destruction
[33:53] there is there is
[33:55] what seems to be the right current i i
[33:58] think i'm in the i've got a nice
[34:00] tailwind i'm going good i've got a nice
[34:02] career i've got a nice job a lot of
[34:04] people like me things are going good
[34:06] that don't necessarily mean
[34:08] that you have found god's current
[34:11] because i want you to get this in your
[34:12] mind right from the very beginning there
[34:15] is a there is a current that that men
[34:19] purport to be
[34:20] the way to go but then there's a current
[34:23] that god has and i want you to know some
[34:25] friends when you really get into and you
[34:28] know uh pilots will tell you this and
[34:31] swimmers will tell you this that when
[34:33] you when you really get into the current
[34:36] i mean and just let it take you
[34:38] and you know
[34:40] there's every pilot loves a good
[34:42] tailwind because i remember i remember
[34:45] when we were when i was lifting off out
[34:48] of lax and i was flying to the
[34:50] philippines on one of my um teeth trips
[34:52] there i don't remember which one it was
[34:54] and i'm on a big jumbo 747
[34:57] and uh we're we're taking off and we get
[35:00] about midway over the pacific which
[35:03] makes the atlantic look like a pond
[35:05] that's why they call it the pond and and
[35:07] all of a sudden the lights all come on
[35:09] i'm sleeping i'm asleep and the lights
[35:11] all come on let's
[35:12] prepare for landing and i'm like
[35:14] landing what how are we
[35:16] where are we landing we're supposed to
[35:18] be headed to you know hawaii and then
[35:20] one stop in hawaii and i said we can't
[35:22] possibly be at honolulu already and uh
[35:26] and so the stewardess comes by i said
[35:28] excuse me miss our flight attendant i
[35:30] think is how they like to be called and
[35:32] i said excuse me miss and she said yes
[35:34] and i said i said we're we're stopping i
[35:37] said but i looked on my schedule i said
[35:40] where are we landing she said we're
[35:42] landing in guam i said in guam the u.s
[35:46] territory she goes yes i said you know
[35:48] there's nothing but like an airfield
[35:49] there it's a military base she goes yeah
[35:50] we gotta land there
[35:52] and i said why are we making an
[35:54] unscheduled stop and she just looked at
[35:56] me and said we're out of gas
[35:59] and i went
[36:00] good answer
[36:03] okay we should land
[36:05] and i said well why why is it not in
[36:07] this he said well the captain called us
[36:09] all forward and said hey we got to make
[36:11] an unscheduled stop because the from the
[36:13] moment we lifted up out of lax he he
[36:16] flew straight into a headwind that was
[36:18] severe and he had to hit the hit the
[36:21] throttles and he burned up all of our
[36:22] gas just trying to get there i was glad
[36:24] he was there i was glad because over the
[36:26] pacific just a little bitty dot and uh i
[36:29] was glad it was there uh but you know it
[36:31] it you know i i've taken trips before
[36:34] where you know you went to a location
[36:36] and it took this many hours and coming
[36:38] back
[36:38] it seemed like wow we got back a lot
[36:40] quicker and i've inquired hey how do we
[36:42] get back so quick i said oh the pilot
[36:44] said we caught a good tailwind and we we
[36:46] were able to fly faster or however it
[36:48] was they did it and
[36:50] and so there's something to finding
[36:52] god's current for your life i want to
[36:54] encourage you tonight to look for it and
[36:56] when you and when you i want to
[36:58] encourage you tonight to want it
[37:00] see now god's current might be different
[37:03] than yours
[37:05] god's current might be a crosswind to
[37:08] your plan
[37:09] but i want to encourage you tonight say
[37:11] what should i do if i find myself in
[37:13] that situation abandon your plan
[37:18] amen
[37:19] abandon your plan find god's
[37:23] current
[37:25] when i when i read this story
[37:29] of
[37:30] the children of israel like kadesh
[37:32] barnea
[37:33] this is uh an epic moment in jewish
[37:36] history
[37:37] it's it's a seminal moment it's uh it's
[37:40] it's almost can't be overstated because
[37:44] this is where this right here
[37:47] is where brother branham said
[37:50] israel made its most irrational decision
[37:55] he called it a rational choice in his
[37:57] kentucky english
[37:59] this is where
[38:00] the decision that they made
[38:03] literally cost them everything yeah amen
[38:08] that they would wonder in the wilderness
[38:11] for 40 more years
[38:14] on a journey that should have only taken
[38:16] a few days
[38:18] you can't get a more epic moment a more
[38:22] epic fail
[38:24] for israel than right here on a text we
[38:27] read tonight
[38:29] so i i use this text quite on purpose
[38:33] not only because it's brother branham's
[38:34] text for time of decision and power of
[38:36] decision there's a lot of power in your
[38:38] decisions and you need to think about
[38:40] your decisions
[38:42] and when i read this story i see two
[38:45] groups interestingly
[38:47] two groups using the same word
[38:50] we
[38:53] caleb still the people before moses and
[38:55] said
[38:57] let us go up at once and possess it
[39:00] for we are well able to overcome it
[39:05] and and uh another group
[39:08] right standing there goes to the same
[39:10] church caleb goes
[39:13] follows the same prophet caleb follows
[39:16] says
[39:18] we be not able to go up against the
[39:21] people for they are stronger than
[39:25] we
[39:27] so when i read this story i see two
[39:30] groups using this same word we but with
[39:33] very different perspectives because
[39:37] kayla and caleb and joshua of course
[39:39] were the spies who brought back the
[39:41] faithful report
[39:43] that
[39:44] with that with the lord's help
[39:47] canaan could easily be taken
[39:49] amen see
[39:51] and so it seems clear to me that when
[39:53] the spies who gave the unfaithful report
[39:56] that they are stronger than we and we
[39:58] are not able to do it they were showing
[40:01] that they had no thought of god being in
[40:05] their we right right amen god wasn't in
[40:09] their we
[40:11] you get the difference with caleb and
[40:13] joshua
[40:14] they knew they had no power to do that
[40:17] but they said but what their message was
[40:20] with god's help in fact is caleb caleb
[40:23] later comes down in the 14th chapter and
[40:25] says if the lord delight in us then he
[40:27] will bring us into this land and give it
[40:30] us
[40:31] see
[40:32] and so this is the all too familiar
[40:36] example
[40:37] of people who have
[40:40] oh my who have seen god
[40:43] do such great things i mean was there
[40:46] anybody that you could you imagine
[40:49] anybody
[40:50] in the bible that you could read about
[40:54] as the children of israel who saw more
[40:57] of the supernatural just look what they
[40:59] saw in egypt
[41:00] amen while they were there
[41:03] i mean the
[41:04] flies the frogs the darkness the blood
[41:08] and the water i mean the hail with fire
[41:11] mingled in it and then and while all of
[41:14] egypt was in darkness they were in light
[41:17] and while all the firstborn of egypt was
[41:20] dying not just first-born children
[41:21] firstborn dogs and cats and cows
[41:24] but all of israel was safe you talking
[41:27] about and then that they were brought
[41:29] out of a superpower who couldn't stop
[41:31] them and then they then they watched god
[41:34] deliver them and and part the red sea
[41:38] when you see that you know on the
[41:40] evening news
[41:42] yeah amen
[41:44] the sea parts
[41:46] and they didn't slosh across through mud
[41:49] they walked on dry ground
[41:52] and they say well yeah they said i was a
[41:53] sea of reeds brother brandon said how
[41:55] what a ridiculous thing how did the seer
[41:57] reach then drown the egyptian army
[41:58] trying to follow them
[42:01] and they literally watched all of that
[42:03] take place this is such a classic too
[42:06] familiar as i said it's a two familiar
[42:09] example of people who have seen god do
[42:13] such great things yet remain forever
[42:16] unspiritual
[42:18] amen living out their lives in lukewarm
[42:22] experience that won't save them in the
[42:24] end right amen amen
[42:28] for their faithfulness god allowed
[42:30] caleb and
[42:32] and and and joshua for their
[42:34] faithfulness god allowed them to survive
[42:37] the wilderness experience
[42:39] and enter into canaan you find on down
[42:41] in the 14th chapter if you go all the
[42:43] way to the 26th chapter we're not doing
[42:45] it tonight but when they when moses
[42:47] takes the second census
[42:49] in in numbers 26
[42:51] that actually caleb and joshua were the
[42:54] only ones from the original group that
[42:56] were even still alive
[42:59] that decision
[43:01] that they had about the word preserved
[43:04] their lives unto canaan's land
[43:08] oh i want something to preserve my life
[43:11] till i get to canaan's land
[43:13] see
[43:15] and so after
[43:17] the major campaigns of the conquest were
[43:20] completed then
[43:21] joshua actually divided the land of
[43:23] canaan by lot the lord told him to do
[43:25] that you'll divide it by lot but in
[43:27] keeping with god's promise which had
[43:29] been 45 years earlier
[43:32] caleb actually was the very first one to
[43:35] be given his land
[43:37] and he was given that land he was
[43:39] allotted hebron near the cave of mach
[43:42] pilar uh where the patriarchs
[43:46] that was where the patriarchs that's
[43:47] where abraham buried sarah that's where
[43:49] all the patriarchs were buried i thought
[43:52] to myself i want to be buried where the
[43:54] early church fathers were buried
[43:55] wherever they buried in christ
[43:58] hallelujah i want to make the same
[43:59] choices of the word so that i can be
[44:01] buried by the same place that my church
[44:04] fathers were buried because i've been
[44:05] restored to their faith and i want to be
[44:08] able to live where they now live amen
[44:12] see
[44:13] and so it comes down to focusing on the
[44:17] word in our lives
[44:20] so that because listen friends and this
[44:23] is a very important point i i i read
[44:25] this this little snippet of a quote here
[44:27] and i'm not gonna i don't have it on the
[44:28] display i'm just gonna read it for you
[44:30] brother branham takes from the message
[44:32] look in 1963 this is just a few weeks
[44:34] after he finished preaching the opening
[44:36] of the seals
[44:38] and brother branham says
[44:40] speaking of christ how that he was the
[44:42] word
[44:43] there you are see so he he comes to an
[44:46] audience and he says what are you
[44:48] looking at
[44:49] see
[44:50] what now you say well we're looking at
[44:52] this yeah but what do you see
[44:54] what do you see when you look at god's
[44:56] word do you what do you see when you
[44:58] open up a message book what do you see
[45:00] what do you hear when i say god sent a
[45:03] prophet
[45:04] do you just hear doctrine do you just
[45:06] hear an idea do you hear philosophy some
[45:09] too many people today even said in
[45:11] message churches and they're not even as
[45:13] sure as they used to be right amen
[45:17] and to which i say that's about as bad
[45:20] as you can possibly be because if you
[45:22] don't if this message isn't it then i
[45:25] don't know of anything else close to it
[45:27] and and i'm saying how am i getting home
[45:30] how am i getting out of here hallelujah
[45:32] i'm here to tell you friends we have not
[45:34] followed cunningly devised tales and god
[45:36] still moves and god is still proving and
[45:38] vindicating his word in our lives
[45:42] keeping you sane in an insane world or
[45:44] to be proof enough keeping you right
[45:47] side up in an upside down world or to be
[45:49] proof enough
[45:52] but remember the idea is not about
[45:54] agreement with doctrine that's because
[45:57] the devil agrees with doctrine
[46:00] this says that that god is and the devil
[46:02] believes that
[46:04] see and he actually fears and trembles
[46:06] at the very name of jesus christ that
[46:08] doesn't make him a believer so it's not
[46:10] just about believing that it's accurate
[46:12] or believing that it's true brother
[46:13] branham says when you recognize he was
[46:16] the word there you are then you
[46:18] now watch because this is a procedure
[46:21] you got to go through the motions of
[46:22] this
[46:23] then you and the word
[46:26] are focused in together
[46:28] you become you become something
[46:31] something more than you are
[46:33] that's why the message came to make you
[46:35] something more than you are one of these
[46:37] days i'm going to be a glorified me
[46:39] that's going to be quite a bit more than
[46:41] i am right now
[46:43] but i'll never get that outside unless i
[46:45] have it on the inside you'll never i
[46:48] promise you the message of the hour is
[46:50] revelation 18 4 come out of her amen i
[46:53] like how brother jack duff says it he
[46:55] says that if you want to hear the sound
[46:57] if you want to hear the call come up you
[46:59] better hear the call come out because if
[47:01] you don't come out you'll never go up
[47:03] you've got to first hear come out and
[47:05] then you can hear come up
[47:07] hallelujah
[47:09] you become a living unit of god
[47:12] so so it's to focus on the word so that
[47:15] our life
[47:17] so that our life
[47:20] our life
[47:22] and the word become
[47:25] one
[47:26] amen
[47:28] so that you become
[47:30] a living unit
[47:32] of the word
[47:34] you become the living
[47:36] word you see amen
[47:39] so
[47:40] so brother brandon says you become
[47:42] a living unit
[47:44] of god
[47:45] that's that's a lot more than just
[47:47] believing doctrinal teaching
[47:51] there's doctrinal teaching we don't even
[47:53] fully understand but that's not going to
[47:54] stop me from becoming a living unit
[47:57] see
[47:58] i've occasionally been wrong on my
[48:00] doctrinal understanding but that didn't
[48:02] stop me from becoming a living unit
[48:04] see
[48:07] enoch
[48:08] brother enoch
[48:11] enoch built one of the seven wonders of
[48:14] the ancient world
[48:17] in the great pyramid of giza
[48:20] it's interesting because the turns and
[48:23] the cuts
[48:24] that he made are
[48:26] literally
[48:28] baffling to science to this day
[48:31] i i've seen enough uh highly acclaimed
[48:34] documentaries oh i know that the version
[48:37] they tell us in school
[48:38] you know they want you to believe
[48:40] somehow they had
[48:41] millions of slaves using logs and long
[48:44] ramps that were a mile long and somehow
[48:46] they rolled those stones up there and i
[48:48] i just not too long ago saw right on
[48:51] national geographic or pbs one of them
[48:53] and a new scientist went through there
[48:55] and he said
[48:57] he said that
[48:58] how they got these stones in place is
[49:00] just one little small piece he said let
[49:02] me take you on a trip and he said look
[49:03] at these cuts and turns and sm and walls
[49:05] he said there was no there wasn't even a
[49:07] tool in existence back then that could
[49:09] make this kind of a cut
[49:11] or this kind of a turn or this kind of
[49:13] an arch
[49:14] he said it wouldn't have done any good
[49:16] to have 10 million slaves trying to do
[49:18] it they didn't have the possibility to
[49:21] do it and they pulled stones weighing so
[49:23] many tons and hauled them for hundreds
[49:26] of miles out of out of quarries that
[49:28] were hundreds of miles away
[49:31] and he said to hawaii the whole idea
[49:33] that he said i'm here and they finally
[49:35] asked him well how did they build it he
[49:36] said they had a power we don't
[49:38] understand amen
[49:40] i said that's a very that's a very good
[49:43] doctrine it's about 50 60 years too late
[49:46] prophet already told us that in the
[49:48] 1950s
[49:51] but enoch built one of the seven wonders
[49:53] of the ancient world and
[49:55] his turns and his cuts and the things
[49:58] that he was able to do
[49:59] baffling science and how it aligns with
[50:02] the stars so perfectly
[50:04] seven steps to the king's chamber on and
[50:06] on and on and on it goes we're not here
[50:08] to preach pyramid teaching tonight but
[50:11] we found that it was god's actually
[50:13] god's second bible
[50:14] and the first one was written in the
[50:16] stars in the zodiac and so and and and
[50:19] that pyramid now of course the pyramid
[50:21] while it was god's second bible overall
[50:23] was actually the first one ever
[50:24] assembled in the earth
[50:27] see that was a that was a bible yeah and
[50:30] and and the the and and it's in harmony
[50:33] with the heavenly bible
[50:35] i mean how did how did that happen yeah
[50:37] see
[50:38] and so so we find that
[50:41] that enoch of course according to to the
[50:44] bible that there's none good no not one
[50:46] and none of us are good paul said we're
[50:47] all open sepulchers we're all dead men
[50:50] see there's only one good one and that
[50:52] was god and that was in christ
[50:54] there's only one perfect man even elijah
[50:57] had his ups and downs according to the
[50:59] scripture according to a prophet he was
[51:01] a man of like passions brother rem said
[51:03] it mean he had his ups and downs
[51:05] so we find that there was no perfect man
[51:08] uh you could find the bible talking
[51:09] about job perfect in all of his ways uh
[51:12] but yet still we found that un when put
[51:15] when pressure come job had wrong
[51:17] thinking and god had to absolutely
[51:19] actually openly rebuke job for his
[51:21] thinking
[51:23] and and so so we we realized that enoch
[51:26] would not have been a perfect man but
[51:28] his faith
[51:30] his revelation
[51:32] of the revealed word was perfect
[51:35] and you actually can see his perfect
[51:38] faith because it manifested itself he
[51:42] literally built the image of the word in
[51:46] the pyramid amen
[51:48] amen so you understand that that pyramid
[51:52] was an expression of his of his vision
[51:55] of his revelation of his faith and what
[51:58] he built was perfect just like the stars
[52:00] were perfect the pyramid was perfect
[52:02] this is perfect
[52:04] amen you understand
[52:06] here it is all these different books
[52:08] with all these different authors over
[52:09] all these thousands of years and yet it
[52:11] all perfectly there's not a single
[52:12] contradiction in it and and people don't
[52:15] understand it neither do they understand
[52:17] the second bible or his first bible they
[52:19] don't understand the bible living in
[52:21] skin right here in you and i
[52:25] see
[52:26] they didn't understand it in a lowly
[52:28] nazarene they didn't know that was the
[52:29] word living in skin amen it looked too
[52:33] simple for them he's a carpenter's son
[52:35] we know his mother and father we i saw
[52:37] the manger he was born and i saw the
[52:39] cradle he was rocked in remember i
[52:40] preached here last time there's
[52:42] sometimes you have to first unseed to
[52:44] see
[52:45] you've got to unsee a lot of man-made
[52:47] tradition if you want to see the
[52:48] revealed word of the hour
[52:50] you got to unsee some of your own
[52:52] training and your own raising and your
[52:54] own your own social uh socialization if
[52:57] you want to see the power of god how
[52:59] many want to see the power of god in
[53:01] their lives
[53:04] and so we find that
[53:08] that he literally built the image
[53:10] we talk a lot about perfect faith coming
[53:13] at the end time but i want you to know
[53:15] something friends perfect faith is here
[53:18] now
[53:19] quit putting it off to never neverland
[53:22] somewhere over a rainbow we're going to
[53:24] get perfect faith i'm here to tell you
[53:26] it's here now and it's a perfect faith
[53:28] and a perfectly revealed word and i got
[53:31] it
[53:32] hallelujah
[53:34] say brother jason how do you know
[53:36] that you have perfect faith in the
[53:39] revealed word
[53:40] because it still builds wonders over the
[53:42] world hallelujah
[53:45] it still builds humble
[53:47] god-fearing people they don't know how
[53:49] you make those turns in your life that
[53:51] you do
[53:52] just like they couldn't figure out the
[53:53] turns and cuts and and things that enoch
[53:56] did they don't know how you make the
[53:57] turns you do and turning turning from
[54:00] sin they don't know how you turn from
[54:02] dishonesty before god they don't know
[54:04] how they you say how do you do it how do
[54:07] you live like that how do you live
[54:08] separate because i have a real
[54:10] experience
[54:12] i have a living revelation and that's
[54:15] perfect faith brother madam said what is
[54:16] the new birth it's a revelation of jesus
[54:19] christ personally to you
[54:25] how do you make those cuts we don't know
[54:26] how you make those cuts
[54:28] those clear-cut decisions for christ and
[54:31] his word how is it you're willing to
[54:33] stand apart from the world how is it
[54:36] that the things of the world we what do
[54:38] we do with things of the world we cut
[54:40] them free from our lives
[54:42] a real believer has no desire to have
[54:44] things of the world hanging on him
[54:47] if you don't if you if that's not your
[54:49] heart tonight then you need to get born
[54:51] again
[54:52] because i realize our flesh still
[54:55] lust after the things of the world
[54:56] that's why we bring it subject under
[54:58] prayer and under fellowship and under
[55:00] church and under the bible and under
[55:01] under listening to the message i'm going
[55:03] to tell you there's strength in that
[55:06] one of the things that we don't do is
[55:08] allow this flesh to rule the inner man
[55:10] i'm not here
[55:12] i'm not here to let the outer man run
[55:13] the inner man up it's the other way
[55:15] around for me amen
[55:19] so we cut them free just like enoch cut
[55:22] things
[55:24] the way that your daily life
[55:26] listen friends the very way
[55:31] that your daily life like the great
[55:33] pyramid
[55:36] rises off the earth's floor
[55:38] [Music]
[55:40] towers upward and points to the sky
[55:43] that's what enoch's pyramid did
[55:46] it literally rose up off the earth floor
[55:48] and it towered upward and it today
[55:51] stands as a marker pointing to the skies
[55:54] that's what brother branham said when
[55:56] brother branham when the spirit of god
[55:58] struck him and said pick up your pen and
[56:00] write and brother branham said i just
[56:02] started writing he said i didn't even
[56:04] know what i was writing said i had to go
[56:05] back and read it myself and when he when
[56:08] he went back to read it the lord is
[56:09] speaking now here's what i'm trying to
[56:12] say to you the law of reproduction is
[56:13] that and it goes on down through there
[56:15] and when it comes down to the end well
[56:17] why is that important because the law of
[56:19] reproduction it means seed whatever seed
[56:22] you plant is going to bring forth what
[56:24] you planted
[56:25] so if you sow the word in your life
[56:28] guess what happens to your life you
[56:30] become a garden of god
[56:32] you you literally god doesn't need to
[56:35] bring back the garden of eden he's got
[56:37] you and me
[56:38] to be his garden of eden hallelujah
[56:42] he says i am the vine my father is the
[56:45] husband my father is the gardener my
[56:47] father's the farmer
[56:49] he knows how to grow his crop
[56:53] and brother branham says there under the
[56:55] under the inspiration of the spirit he
[56:57] says just as elijah
[56:59] and john the baptist
[57:01] he says just as elijah of that day
[57:05] pointed to the lamb of god and screamed
[57:07] out to the people behold the lamb of god
[57:11] now you would think
[57:13] the next line would be
[57:15] so the elijah of the last day will point
[57:18] and say behold the lamb of god that's
[57:20] not what the spirit had him right
[57:22] the holy spirit actually had him right
[57:25] just as elijah in john's day pointed to
[57:28] christ and said behold the lamb of god
[57:31] he said the elijah of this day will
[57:33] point to a word-born bride
[57:36] and the word-born bride the bride of
[57:39] christ will be pointed to the skies just
[57:43] like a pyramid the bride of christ will
[57:45] be pointed to the skies at the appearing
[57:48] of jesus screaming behold the lamb of
[57:52] god i'm here to tell you something
[57:54] friends it's not all about just getting
[57:56] out on the street and screaming behold
[57:57] the lamb of god my life is a trumpeting
[58:01] sound my life is a screaming my life
[58:03] rises up off the earth with cuts and
[58:05] turns the world can't understand and i'm
[58:08] i'm i'm pointing to the sky trying to
[58:10] say to the world look this life i have
[58:13] behold the lamb of god
[58:17] see
[58:18] amen it's not yet there i mean at this
[58:20] point it is a fact of his it is a fact
[58:24] of prophecy that god sent a prophet but
[58:27] that's not the main scream now
[58:29] that's still being shouted all around
[58:31] the world i'm still telling everybody i
[58:32] can who don't know that yeah see
[58:35] we say well why is that still important
[58:37] then because
[58:39] that's how to how else do i get them out
[58:41] of the great lie
[58:42] how do i
[58:44] how do i
[58:45] how do i tell them about the greatest
[58:47] existential threat humanity faces
[58:51] the great lie
[58:52] remember to believe a lie and be damned
[58:55] about it remember that in the scripture
[58:57] and the great lie is
[58:59] that you just make a decision for christ
[59:02] and that's all you got to do
[59:04] and the great the what they don't know
[59:06] it they're blind because the bible says
[59:08] laodicea was blind
[59:10] and so the whole world according to
[59:11] isaiah is blind and all the people are
[59:13] in gross darkness
[59:15] and they're and what they don't know
[59:17] that i happen to know
[59:19] what they don't know
[59:21] is that denominationalism
[59:23] will lead them to the mark of the beast
[59:26] in the tribulation
[59:28] how are they going to know that if i
[59:30] don't tell them how are they going to
[59:32] know what the peace system is how are
[59:34] they going to know to come out of that
[59:36] my people otherwise you're going to go
[59:38] into a tribulation it doesn't matter
[59:40] denominationalism
[59:43] denominationalism is leading people
[59:46] to the mark of the beast
[59:50] and they'll have an image on the
[59:52] confederation of church is not going to
[59:53] have they already have it
[59:55] and that is the image to the beast in
[59:57] the book of revelation and the world's
[59:58] blind to that what do you want me to do
[1:00:00] not tell them
[1:00:02] i mean it's the greatest threat to
[1:00:05] humanity the greatest threats not global
[1:00:07] warming
[1:00:08] the greatest threats not china or iran
[1:00:11] the greatest threat is the big lie that
[1:00:13] they're all believing because the two
[1:00:15] messengers to laodicea blinded them into
[1:00:17] thinking that
[1:00:18] i'm here to tell you i got to lift up my
[1:00:20] voice and say god sent a prophet and a
[1:00:22] prophet warned us in the bible come out
[1:00:25] of that you're going to die staying in
[1:00:27] that
[1:00:29] that's the saith the lord that's the
[1:00:30] scriptures
[1:00:33] see
[1:00:34] so
[1:00:35] the way our life aligns
[1:00:39] with the same kind of harmony that they
[1:00:42] can see in the stars and see in the
[1:00:44] heavens they can see enoch's pyramid
[1:00:46] agrees with the heavens
[1:00:48] they can see this revelation fits this
[1:00:50] revelation
[1:00:52] when they see you
[1:00:54] when they engage you in conversation can
[1:00:57] they see and hear that your revelation
[1:00:59] and this revelation and that revelation
[1:01:01] is all the same revelation
[1:01:04] that's what my message to you tonight is
[1:01:07] all about you need to find god's main
[1:01:10] current for your life
[1:01:12] because his main current is that you be
[1:01:15] build it up and be pointing to the lamb
[1:01:17] of god
[1:01:18] [Music]
[1:01:19] amen
[1:01:21] where does this harmony come from
[1:01:25] where does this amen to every word
[1:01:29] come from
[1:01:32] brother branham
[1:01:33] goes into the masterpiece message and
[1:01:35] i've talked about this before it always
[1:01:37] moves me
[1:01:39] that how that
[1:01:41] when angelo
[1:01:43] broke a piece off
[1:01:45] and it flew
[1:01:47] and there's a a flaw
[1:01:49] now on the
[1:01:51] on the statue of michelangelo of moses
[1:01:55] and
[1:01:56] you know people say oh man if it just
[1:01:58] didn't have that flaw you know it could
[1:02:01] have been it could have been a greater
[1:02:02] masterpiece it's a masterpiece because
[1:02:04] you know michelangelo did it but how
[1:02:06] much greater it could have been oh if he
[1:02:07] just hadn't done that
[1:02:09] but brother branham said now to me it's
[1:02:12] just the opposite
[1:02:13] see
[1:02:14] because to a prophet
[1:02:16] that that that that there must be a
[1:02:19] piece broken off
[1:02:21] to make this the masterpiece i mean
[1:02:23] how's this the master piece unless
[1:02:25] there's another piece
[1:02:28] there's a piece flew off
[1:02:31] it goes on this masterpiece
[1:02:34] you understand
[1:02:35] so jesus said i come from god i go back
[1:02:38] to god he's god's perfect masterpiece
[1:02:41] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:02:42] what where's that amen come from not
[1:02:45] because you were smarter where does that
[1:02:47] where does that desire in your life to
[1:02:50] to live and to have a voice of the
[1:02:52] resurrection it's not because you are
[1:02:54] smarter it's because you came from
[1:02:57] somewhere it's because you're a part of
[1:02:59] something that's greater than you
[1:03:02] it's greater and say i made a decision
[1:03:04] this is greater than any decision you
[1:03:06] ever made
[1:03:08] you didn't the bride of christ is
[1:03:09] actually the only humans in the world
[1:03:11] who don't make a decision
[1:03:13] jesus said you have not chosen me i have
[1:03:16] chosen you
[1:03:18] [Music]
[1:03:19] it's only the rest of the world who has
[1:03:20] to make that decision not me i'm part of
[1:03:22] that word
[1:03:24] i was born that way
[1:03:26] i still had to be born again
[1:03:28] so i had to have the holy ghost
[1:03:29] otherwise otherwise that that gene stays
[1:03:32] dormant and i and i my life never
[1:03:34] becomes enoch's pyramid my life never
[1:03:36] points and says behold the lamb of god
[1:03:39] amen this is why we preach this is why
[1:03:41] we're here this is why you come to
[1:03:43] church this is why we proclaim god sent
[1:03:45] a message not to make theologians out of
[1:03:46] us or to give us better theology but to
[1:03:48] make us great pyramids to make us
[1:03:50] wonders of the world
[1:03:53] see that's what it come for
[1:03:58] elisha received a double portion oh i
[1:04:01] got to hurry
[1:04:02] that was on elijah
[1:04:06] and you know it's interesting because
[1:04:09] you know
[1:04:10] just as you
[1:04:12] you really can't know
[1:04:14] the full experience everybody in here
[1:04:16] who's had children if you've you're
[1:04:18] young and you've never had children
[1:04:19] you're you're you're going to understand
[1:04:21] what i'm saying you're going to agree
[1:04:22] with it but you're not going to get it
[1:04:24] like the ones who have had children and
[1:04:27] even now grandchildren you really get it
[1:04:30] just as you can't know
[1:04:33] the full experience of having children
[1:04:36] unless you have had them
[1:04:39] see you can learn about what it means to
[1:04:42] have children you you can get a nice
[1:04:44] textbook education on how to raise them
[1:04:48] but unless you actually
[1:04:50] have the experience you'll be missing
[1:04:53] critical elements that qualify you to
[1:04:56] judge being a parent amen
[1:04:58] you're an unqualified judge of parents
[1:05:00] if you don't have children
[1:05:02] because you might have learned about it
[1:05:04] in a textbook but that's everybody in
[1:05:06] here that's had a child understands what
[1:05:08] i get
[1:05:09] we can get that with a look i just go
[1:05:10] you know yeah i get it i don't really
[1:05:12] have to explain it
[1:05:14] that when you actually have your own
[1:05:16] children
[1:05:17] there's a knowing that that is
[1:05:20] is otherworldly
[1:05:22] amen and it's you're you're ready now
[1:05:25] suddenly
[1:05:26] to
[1:05:28] give your life immediately without
[1:05:30] question hesitation to save the life of
[1:05:32] this one amen
[1:05:34] you're literally ready to to turn your
[1:05:36] life on end so that this one can now
[1:05:38] have a great life you'll do anything for
[1:05:40] your children
[1:05:42] see
[1:05:43] and so
[1:05:44] so elisha then
[1:05:46] receives
[1:05:48] a double portion in other words he he
[1:05:51] had the experience of elijah duplicated
[1:05:54] upon himself
[1:05:55] you understand so receiving the
[1:05:58] duplicated experience
[1:06:00] of the same spirit of christ that was on
[1:06:04] elijah
[1:06:05] makes only elisha
[1:06:08] in his day
[1:06:10] only elisha was qualified to judge the
[1:06:13] ministry of elijah
[1:06:15] amen he was the only one because he was
[1:06:18] the only one who had that duplicated
[1:06:20] experience
[1:06:21] you see and so so all others
[1:06:25] all others are unqualified to judge it
[1:06:28] the school of the prophets couldn't
[1:06:29] judge it they tried they got it all
[1:06:31] mixed up and got it wrong
[1:06:32] they said oh he's hiding and he's on
[1:06:34] another mountain we're gonna go find him
[1:06:35] and elisha said
[1:06:36] he won't find him he's gone
[1:06:38] oh no we'll find him we'll have search
[1:06:40] committee we we know this land like the
[1:06:42] back of our hand we'll fight him okay go
[1:06:43] ahead
[1:06:44] then they come back we couldn't find him
[1:06:46] i told you
[1:06:47] see
[1:06:49] because they didn't understand the
[1:06:51] ministry of elijah they simply
[1:06:54] did not know what his ministry they were
[1:06:56] unqualified to know what his ministry
[1:06:59] was about they simply
[1:07:01] it's not that they were bad people they
[1:07:03] simply did not have his experience they
[1:07:06] did not have elisha's same experience
[1:07:10] just as you just as you can't know the
[1:07:13] full experience of having children
[1:07:15] unless you've had them
[1:07:17] see
[1:07:18] and so so we realized that only those
[1:07:20] who actually followed elijah's ministry
[1:07:24] and have the same experience of the holy
[1:07:27] ghost can't even understand what it's
[1:07:29] all about
[1:07:30] [Music]
[1:07:31] see
[1:07:32] the born-again bride this literally
[1:07:34] means that the born-again bride
[1:07:38] is the only people in the earth who can
[1:07:41] judge this ministry of the last day
[1:07:44] see
[1:07:46] all other judgments are perfectly
[1:07:49] unqualified
[1:07:50] factually
[1:07:52] unqualified
[1:07:54] see
[1:07:55] i i've
[1:07:56] i i remember one time i had a young lady
[1:07:59] meet me in my back office and she was
[1:08:01] headed into the world i could see it
[1:08:03] she'd never had a holy ghost experience
[1:08:05] i could see it
[1:08:07] and
[1:08:08] you know she heard the same sermons as
[1:08:10] everybody else who got the experience
[1:08:12] and are faithful today
[1:08:14] but she made different choices she made
[1:08:16] a different decision
[1:08:18] she said in my office and talked to me
[1:08:19] and said that tried to explain to me
[1:08:21] that that she didn't actually believe
[1:08:23] the message
[1:08:25] and i just said to her honey i said to
[1:08:27] her because i knew her since she's a
[1:08:28] little child excuse me she's probably i
[1:08:30] met her when she was three
[1:08:32] and i said
[1:08:33] and i won't call her name but i said
[1:08:35] honey you you you don't even you don't
[1:08:38] even know what the message is you don't
[1:08:41] even know what you don't believe
[1:08:43] and i said the truth is i looked her in
[1:08:45] the eye i said the truth is
[1:08:47] you just want to go to the world
[1:08:50] the truth is you don't want to be a
[1:08:51] christian
[1:08:52] not a real one anyway see
[1:08:55] that that's the real truth see
[1:08:57] you don't want to be a real
[1:08:59] christian you want to go into the world
[1:09:02] and she admitted it was true and she did
[1:09:04] and she's there to this day
[1:09:07] and and you know because i i wasn't
[1:09:09] going to sit there and accept the excuse
[1:09:11] that she didn't believe the message she
[1:09:12] didn't even know what the message she
[1:09:14] didn't know anything about it she had
[1:09:15] never taken the time to never read a
[1:09:17] book in her life never heard a tape
[1:09:18] probably in her life except maybe what
[1:09:20] her parents were playing and she made
[1:09:21] her decision very early in life that she
[1:09:23] didn't want to be a part of that and she
[1:09:25] stuck to her guns i at least respect her
[1:09:27] for that now she's a very nice girl
[1:09:29] very good friend i still love her still
[1:09:31] pray for
[1:09:33] but but my point is
[1:09:35] that
[1:09:36] she was sitting there making an
[1:09:37] unqualified statement
[1:09:39] i don't believe it's true well you
[1:09:40] wouldn't know
[1:09:42] you wouldn't even have the mechanism to
[1:09:45] know
[1:09:46] because you yourself haven't had the
[1:09:47] same experience see
[1:09:50] and so she she didn't want to be she
[1:09:53] just didn't want to be a christian not a
[1:09:55] real one see and of course when i talk
[1:09:57] about a real christian i'm not just
[1:09:58] talking about message believers friends
[1:10:00] get that narrow-mindedness out of your
[1:10:02] out of your mind we're not just talking
[1:10:03] about message believers there are other
[1:10:05] real sincere people who live in true
[1:10:07] holiness who will actually be granted
[1:10:09] eternal life at the day of judgment and
[1:10:11] live with us in the new heavens and the
[1:10:12] new earth
[1:10:14] amen so don't think more highly of
[1:10:17] yourself
[1:10:18] so that you can't reach out to everybody
[1:10:20] amen so i'm not talking about them
[1:10:23] that's not what i'm talking about i'm
[1:10:24] talking about few people in america i
[1:10:27] mean few people in america mind they
[1:10:29] don't mind at all being being a modern
[1:10:32] day one being a modern day christian see
[1:10:35] but not an authentic one
[1:10:38] not a real one there's only one kind of
[1:10:40] real one
[1:10:42] and those the bible calls them saints
[1:10:44] yes see
[1:10:46] because they're sanctified
[1:10:49] and so so we realize
[1:10:51] that that you know jesus and and here
[1:10:54] here's the thing friends that's not some
[1:10:56] invention that's not some new uh
[1:10:58] conjured up doctrine of the end time
[1:11:00] jesus told us it would be that way
[1:11:04] paul told us it would be that way
[1:11:06] especially when it came down and when it
[1:11:09] got to the end time it would actually be
[1:11:11] acute gland global it would be a
[1:11:14] critical
[1:11:15] element in the earth
[1:11:18] among christianity that's what jesus
[1:11:19] warned of that's what paul warned of
[1:11:24] so we're talking about tonight about
[1:11:25] being an authentic one that means you're
[1:11:28] an original one you know how you're an
[1:11:29] original one because you had the same
[1:11:30] experience the original church had
[1:11:34] and without that same experience you are
[1:11:36] not yet living as a child of god you're
[1:11:39] not even living at all you're still
[1:11:41] dying that's why we say you must be born
[1:11:43] again you must have the baptism of the
[1:11:45] holy ghost
[1:11:47] and that's not hard to get all it takes
[1:11:49] is a full surrender to every word
[1:11:52] and finally get rid of your thinking and
[1:11:54] just say lord come and be the lord of
[1:11:56] all my life
[1:12:00] see that's all it takes to get the
[1:12:03] baptism of the holy ghost it's not hard
[1:12:05] to get
[1:12:07] if you if you meet the condition of the
[1:12:09] word it's your promise just like it is
[1:12:11] mine
[1:12:13] the faculty of making fortunate
[1:12:15] discoveries by accident as a commonly
[1:12:18] held belief in the world have even have
[1:12:21] a fancy word for it called serendipity
[1:12:24] and they'll you know you'll hear them
[1:12:26] say well
[1:12:27] you know
[1:12:28] this person met this person and it was
[1:12:30] just serendipitous because it just so
[1:12:33] happened that he had exactly what he had
[1:12:35] been needing and looking for and they
[1:12:37] just crossed path imagine that
[1:12:39] just kind of accidentally fell out of
[1:12:41] the tree
[1:12:42] and uh and and ran off and did something
[1:12:44] together but we realized that brother
[1:12:47] branham showed us there are no accidents
[1:12:49] there as brother lee on my bible study i
[1:12:52] love how he says that there are no
[1:12:53] accidents there's only god there's only
[1:12:55] god sedence
[1:12:58] so there's god sides say did you become
[1:13:00] a believer by accident no it was a god
[1:13:02] sedan
[1:13:06] hallelujah why are you here tonight
[1:13:07] because you accidentally came to church
[1:13:09] no it was a god sentence
[1:13:11] why can't you run away why can't you go
[1:13:13] in the world it's a god sedence friend
[1:13:16] god is controlling and there are no
[1:13:18] accidents people it's interesting
[1:13:21] because
[1:13:23] people
[1:13:25] how do i say this
[1:13:27] people don't people don't recognize
[1:13:29] brother eugene was teaching this on the
[1:13:31] on the air the other day
[1:13:33] how that how that it moved me i came in
[1:13:36] behind him and made quite a bit of
[1:13:37] commentary on it people don't recognize
[1:13:40] modern events made clear in prophecy
[1:13:41] amen
[1:13:42] amen they're happening
[1:13:45] like popcorn
[1:13:46] all around us
[1:13:48] everything you see in the political
[1:13:49] world right now is being controlled
[1:13:52] because either the prophecy under the
[1:13:53] seals to the gentiles or more probably
[1:13:56] more likely
[1:13:57] the trumpets to the jews
[1:14:00] because god is going back to get israel
[1:14:02] and he can't get them until we're gone
[1:14:05] and that's why i showed you as a hero a
[1:14:07] couple weeks ago in the scriptures that
[1:14:09] you're living at a time where this
[1:14:11] triple triple convergence where the the
[1:14:14] reapers of the last revival this message
[1:14:17] the gentiles are still here in the field
[1:14:19] the field is the world jesus said
[1:14:21] they're still in the field trying to
[1:14:22] gather the last the last remains and
[1:14:25] you've already got the
[1:14:26] the sowers for the next event which is
[1:14:29] moses and elijah and above all of that
[1:14:31] you've got the treader of grapes which
[1:14:33] is the tribulation and you're living in
[1:14:35] a triple convergence of all of that no
[1:14:37] wonder we see things that look like
[1:14:39] pre-tribulation
[1:14:41] judgments and yet we say wait a minute
[1:14:43] we're not supposed to be in the
[1:14:44] tribulation that's correct but what's
[1:14:46] happening is you've got reapers and
[1:14:48] you've got sowers and you've got a
[1:14:50] treader of grapes i'm here to tell you
[1:14:51] you're in an amazing hour friends
[1:14:56] this is a time like it's never been
[1:14:57] before
[1:14:59] and people don't recognize modern events
[1:15:02] that are made clear in prophecy
[1:15:04] what's sad is sometimes even people
[1:15:06] sitting in message churches don't
[1:15:07] recognize it
[1:15:13] that's actually a worse problem see
[1:15:17] say brother jason it's a pretty bold
[1:15:18] statement well i i you know i'm just
[1:15:20] i'm just calling the pyramid like i see
[1:15:23] it amen i'm looking at the pyramid
[1:15:27] and it's it's it's missing its turns and
[1:15:29] cuts
[1:15:30] it's not really rising up off the earth
[1:15:32] floor it's not really pointing to him
[1:15:34] too very much
[1:15:35] see
[1:15:36] the obvious lack of deep spirituality
[1:15:39] reveals itself by the
[1:15:41] lifestyle choices they make i'm not
[1:15:43] saying that to hurt people's feelings
[1:15:45] that's just the truth judgment begins at
[1:15:48] the house of god that's what this is
[1:15:50] this isn't a feel-good place this is a
[1:15:52] judgment place
[1:15:53] this is where you come here and i i can
[1:15:56] i can tell you you know i can tell you
[1:15:58] the things you need to fix as the lord
[1:16:01] said to me say oh i want you to tell me
[1:16:02] something encouraging i am
[1:16:05] i'm telling you how to get fixed
[1:16:08] i'm telling you how to get rid of your
[1:16:09] sin
[1:16:10] i'm telling you all to be ashamed of
[1:16:12] yourself and give your heart more to god
[1:16:14] and more sincerity that's that's
[1:16:16] encouragement amen see
[1:16:19] so so we find that that a lot of times
[1:16:22] i'm looking at too many pyramids and i
[1:16:24] can see the lack of a deep spirituality
[1:16:27] and it reveals itself you know in the
[1:16:29] choices that people make the way they
[1:16:31] just the way they prioritize their
[1:16:33] spiritual needs
[1:16:35] versus their natural needs and wants i
[1:16:37] mean just that one right there i didn't
[1:16:38] got to go to another one
[1:16:40] just the way people prioritize yes amen
[1:16:44] let's just forget about places they go
[1:16:46] and ways they dress and things they do
[1:16:47] that are shameful for a christian to be
[1:16:49] doing going dressing saying
[1:16:52] but just the way that sometimes people
[1:16:54] who sit in message churches claim to be
[1:16:56] believers prioritize
[1:16:58] their natural needs and wants over their
[1:17:01] spiritual needs
[1:17:03] and that is perfectly upside down
[1:17:06] no wonder you don't have the peace of
[1:17:08] god that passes understanding no wonder
[1:17:10] you feel like a neurotic no wonder you
[1:17:12] don't have faith no wonder you're always
[1:17:14] in trouble amen
[1:17:16] see because you know why because god
[1:17:19] loves you
[1:17:21] and he won't let you get by with that
[1:17:25] he will bring you because he loves you
[1:17:29] see
[1:17:32] brother branham said how and i i don't
[1:17:34] remember if i showed you this last
[1:17:36] time
[1:17:38] uh the sunday prior
[1:17:40] but i i i mentioned it to you i just
[1:17:42] didn't i didn't read it to you from the
[1:17:44] masterpiece you remember those those two
[1:17:46] or three little girls at the back of the
[1:17:48] line who got out of step
[1:17:50] and remember that's that's that's they
[1:17:53] were at the back of the back age at the
[1:17:55] back of the line they were the last one
[1:17:57] that's that's you and me
[1:17:59] that's you and me
[1:18:01] and brother branham says
[1:18:03] he says they were getting back i'm
[1:18:05] thankful he said when he came out of the
[1:18:06] vision they were hurrying trying to get
[1:18:08] back in step but he said they were
[1:18:10] trying their best so i i want to say to
[1:18:12] you today are you trying your best
[1:18:15] you might be out of step but try your
[1:18:17] best
[1:18:18] see
[1:18:19] and so he says they were getting back
[1:18:21] just get in line cause here's what
[1:18:23] happened here's what did it because they
[1:18:25] was looking out somewhere else watching
[1:18:28] about that church that just went out
[1:18:30] into chaos see
[1:18:32] so it distracted them and they lost
[1:18:34] their cadence
[1:18:37] they lost their rhythm
[1:18:38] they lost their march
[1:18:40] they were still a believer they were
[1:18:42] still the little bride they were still
[1:18:43] the sainted bunch of little girls they
[1:18:45] were still in an order of ascending they
[1:18:47] were still going up but they were out of
[1:18:49] step
[1:18:50] i'm not here i'm not here today saying
[1:18:52] are you a bunch of unbelievers i'm
[1:18:53] saying too many times i have found
[1:18:55] myself
[1:18:57] come on we're all in this thing together
[1:18:59] you haven't heard me say that in a while
[1:19:00] maybe i need to say it more often we're
[1:19:02] all in this thing together i found
[1:19:04] myself yeah i'm still a believer i'm
[1:19:06] still ascending i still love the lord my
[1:19:08] faith is still perfect but sometimes
[1:19:09] i've got a little distracted
[1:19:12] by the madness of the world and the
[1:19:14] politics and the churches and the social
[1:19:16] uh fabric and say it is distracting
[1:19:20] amen
[1:19:21] and they got out of steps see
[1:19:25] so i find as ministry i thought about
[1:19:27] this as ministry i thought about to
[1:19:29] myself and my fellow ministers here and
[1:19:31] ministers around the world who may hear
[1:19:33] this we must as leaders because the
[1:19:36] distractions are so rampant
[1:19:39] and they cause god's true family to get
[1:19:41] out of step then i say we must raise the
[1:19:44] ensign brothers higher and higher still
[1:19:47] to to do what to counter the descending
[1:19:50] of the age that's going off the cliff we
[1:19:53] must blow the trumpet louder and blow it
[1:19:55] louder and louder and how do you say how
[1:19:57] do we do that brothers by taking
[1:19:59] ourselves deeper and deeper
[1:20:04] into our experience of the holy ghost
[1:20:09] so that god
[1:20:11] can create an attraction on the mountain
[1:20:13] in our lives
[1:20:16] how many want that
[1:20:18] see now
[1:20:23] that's not just pulpit ministers
[1:20:26] can i say that
[1:20:27] that's not just pulpit ministers we're
[1:20:30] all ministers
[1:20:32] we all have loved ones we want to see
[1:20:34] make it
[1:20:35] so we need to have something that will
[1:20:37] catch the hearts and minds of those
[1:20:40] under our care
[1:20:42] see
[1:20:43] and so those who are being distracted by
[1:20:46] the world and the false church plunging
[1:20:48] into chaos i want you to know something
[1:20:51] tonight friends and i want to reiterate
[1:20:52] it from the beginning there is a main
[1:20:54] current that god has there is a main
[1:20:58] current that god has and and
[1:21:00] and it and it flows just like the just
[1:21:03] like the sea of life has a current just
[1:21:05] like the heavens and the atmospheres
[1:21:07] have a current
[1:21:09] i i was praying as i was studying this
[1:21:11] and
[1:21:12] sitting in my
[1:21:14] dark quiet time early in the morning
[1:21:17] one of my favorite times of the day when
[1:21:19] everything is still and it's just me and
[1:21:20] talking to the lord
[1:21:22] and i was thinking and pondering this
[1:21:24] thought and i just said lord help me
[1:21:26] reach the main current lord
[1:21:28] help me lift up higher let me get up
[1:21:30] there in those atmospheres where the
[1:21:32] current is blowing toward calvary let me
[1:21:34] get up there where it's blowing towards
[1:21:36] zion let me get up there lord god
[1:21:39] how many have that desire tonight say
[1:21:40] lord let me find your main current for
[1:21:44] my life
[1:21:47] find the plan of god
[1:21:49] because you know when you get in that
[1:21:51] current then it'll it'll just carry you
[1:21:52] i mean when you get in god's main
[1:21:54] current nature will take its take its
[1:21:56] course
[1:21:57] and you'll find yourself
[1:21:59] following god's word
[1:22:02] i got a little bit more time i'm going
[1:22:04] to use it so just sit still
[1:22:08] you know i read an article a young lady
[1:22:10] wrote very fine
[1:22:12] seemingly young lady wrote a very nice
[1:22:14] article
[1:22:15] about decisions and making decisions and
[1:22:18] she
[1:22:19] titled it swimming against the current
[1:22:22] and she talks about how that
[1:22:26] that
[1:22:27] she was grateful to her parents because
[1:22:29] when she was being raised
[1:22:32] that
[1:22:32] you know she was she was just you know
[1:22:35] praising her parents and and the first
[1:22:38] thing that raised my eyebrow the first
[1:22:40] time is she said you know from a very
[1:22:43] early age they they
[1:22:45] basically not basically they did give me
[1:22:48] freedom to just do whatever i wanted to
[1:22:50] do and i went oh boy
[1:22:52] i wonder how that's going to turn out
[1:22:54] and i'm just reading
[1:22:56] and she said that
[1:22:58] she went on and she actually began to
[1:22:59] make some good points and i thought you
[1:23:01] know that even even that's that's good
[1:23:04] psychology i mean that's that's helpful
[1:23:06] if if taken in the right way
[1:23:09] and she thought about she said one of
[1:23:11] the things that whenever she said
[1:23:12] whenever the only requirement we had was
[1:23:14] we had to agree to sit down with our
[1:23:16] parents and tell them the decisions we
[1:23:17] were about to make and and at least
[1:23:21] let them hear it and and advise us
[1:23:24] and so she said me and my siblings we
[1:23:26] made that deal
[1:23:28] and so she said they had a list of
[1:23:30] questions and they were always the same
[1:23:32] and they're very fine questions they're
[1:23:34] very good questions as parents you're
[1:23:35] going to see that's a pretty good
[1:23:36] question
[1:23:37] and
[1:23:38] here here was her ques the questions
[1:23:41] questions to ask regarding decisions
[1:23:44] number one
[1:23:45] how do you think your decision will
[1:23:48] impact you and those involved
[1:23:51] decent question you agree
[1:23:54] number two do you think
[1:23:56] this is the best choice you can make
[1:24:00] and number three
[1:24:01] is that what you really want
[1:24:04] and it was these three questions
[1:24:08] and there was a fourth one i'll get to
[1:24:09] shortly
[1:24:10] if i don't run out of time but
[1:24:14] these were and she said that they had to
[1:24:17] the deal was we had to listen to these
[1:24:19] questions and we had to honestly answer
[1:24:21] them and we had to deliberate and
[1:24:23] sometimes we had to deliberate a couple
[1:24:26] of days until we could come back to them
[1:24:28] and say
[1:24:29] i have thought about the impact that the
[1:24:31] decision i'm about to make i have
[1:24:33] thought through the impact that it will
[1:24:36] have on me and anyone else involved see
[1:24:40] because i used to tell i just tell my
[1:24:41] children growing up listen boys this is
[1:24:44] bigger than you
[1:24:45] you're making decisions that affect me
[1:24:47] and mom you're making decisions that
[1:24:49] affect our name
[1:24:50] so you know don't be selfish
[1:24:53] because this life is bigger than you
[1:24:55] life ain't here to suit all your needs
[1:24:57] see i mean all your wants
[1:25:00] and so
[1:25:01] do you think this is the best choice you
[1:25:04] can make and is that think think hard
[1:25:07] now is that what you really want
[1:25:11] and she went on to preach a gospel of
[1:25:14] swimming against the current
[1:25:18] in fact as these were her main points
[1:25:20] swimming against the current
[1:25:22] not caring about what people will say
[1:25:26] following your dreams
[1:25:28] now
[1:25:30] listen friends i want to say something
[1:25:32] that
[1:25:33] watch now let me let me go on
[1:25:35] now i want to there's results to this
[1:25:37] this was part of her article that if you
[1:25:41] if you
[1:25:43] think these things through and you swim
[1:25:45] again you're willing to swim against the
[1:25:47] current
[1:25:49] and you're willing to not care what
[1:25:50] people say as long as you're following
[1:25:52] your dreams you know some of the
[1:25:54] advantages of that can be
[1:25:56] it gives you the power to say no when
[1:25:58] required
[1:26:00] it teaches you to follow your hunch
[1:26:02] it gives you the power to create your
[1:26:04] own destiny
[1:26:06] it gives you the courage to take your
[1:26:08] imagination to the next level it reveals
[1:26:11] the hidden talents and qualities within
[1:26:13] you all sounds really good
[1:26:16] all of that psychology psychologically
[1:26:19] that sounds really good and i wouldn't
[1:26:22] doubt that in a from a humanistic point
[1:26:25] of view you might reap some or all of
[1:26:26] these advantages
[1:26:29] but what i went through the article with
[1:26:32] a fine-tooth comb
[1:26:34] and i went through it because i was
[1:26:36] looking i thought surely
[1:26:38] surely somewhere surely
[1:26:41] somewhere this young woman is going to
[1:26:44] at least
[1:26:46] in a cursory way mention
[1:26:49] she's at least surely going to mention
[1:26:52] thank god or i was very blessed you know
[1:26:55] the modern language they used today
[1:26:58] i was i was so blessed you know and and
[1:27:01] and i read through it i didn't find it
[1:27:03] and i thought i got to read it again and
[1:27:04] i read through it again and i was
[1:27:05] looking carefully and slowly to see if
[1:27:07] she made even a single reference
[1:27:09] say well brother jason
[1:27:11] why does if this is good psychologically
[1:27:15] then why does she got to worry about god
[1:27:17] well i mean
[1:27:18] that's just like communism
[1:27:21] communism actually is a bible doctrine
[1:27:24] sure in the book of acts they had all
[1:27:27] things in common
[1:27:30] ananias and sapphira died because they
[1:27:32] weren't good communists
[1:27:38] see
[1:27:39] and so
[1:27:40] so they had all things in common and
[1:27:43] and that that's that and that's what
[1:27:45] marxism brother branham talks about the
[1:27:47] tenets of marxism if you go and read it
[1:27:49] about equality of everybody and
[1:27:51] everybody have all things in common and
[1:27:53] let's let's all be all it's kind of like
[1:27:55] all for one and one for all it's kind of
[1:27:57] like the millennium will be set up see
[1:28:00] but the problem with that that that they
[1:28:02] did was they got a hold of a bible
[1:28:05] concept of
[1:28:06] communal living
[1:28:08] and they erased god out of it and that's
[1:28:11] why brother branham said communism was
[1:28:13] wrong
[1:28:14] modern-day political communism is of the
[1:28:17] devil
[1:28:18] and it's a tool in the hands of god to
[1:28:20] destroy catholicism which is worse
[1:28:24] catholicism is worse than
[1:28:26] communism and communism will destroy it
[1:28:29] so so it's it's it doesn't it it might
[1:28:32] be a good principle it might have all of
[1:28:34] these good advantages but where's god in
[1:28:36] it
[1:28:38] see
[1:28:39] how how are you going to how you're
[1:28:41] going to hope that this is going to turn
[1:28:43] out what they're trying to say well you
[1:28:46] know did she have a good career yet
[1:28:47] she'd make a lot of money sure was she
[1:28:49] seemingly happy yes and she had her
[1:28:51] career and i'm sure listen let me tell
[1:28:53] you something unless she ever finds god
[1:28:55] in her life and maybe she does i don't
[1:28:57] know but i'm just using it as an example
[1:28:59] hypothetically speaking unless unless
[1:29:01] this woman if this woman is without god
[1:29:03] in her life you know what'll be her
[1:29:05] outcome she'll stay rich and successful
[1:29:08] and alive and healthy and happy until
[1:29:10] she's not
[1:29:12] amen
[1:29:14] until she's not
[1:29:16] she'll stay ahead of it and big bank
[1:29:18] accounts and big happiness and big
[1:29:20] social circles and alive and healthy and
[1:29:22] happy until she's not
[1:29:25] because all of it comes to
[1:29:27] a serendipitous end
[1:29:31] no it's not serendipitous it's not
[1:29:32] accidental
[1:29:34] it's not accidental people don't
[1:29:37] actually accidentally end up in hell
[1:29:40] because god christ died for their sins
[1:29:42] to keep them from going there and if
[1:29:44] they go there they didn't get there by
[1:29:46] accident
[1:29:47] they got there because of determination
[1:29:50] they persevered to go to hell
[1:29:52] you see
[1:29:54] and so so you find then
[1:29:56] that
[1:29:58] you know that that they're good
[1:30:00] questions
[1:30:02] and they seem to have good advantages
[1:30:05] they seem to have good outcomes let me
[1:30:08] hold it right there
[1:30:09] they seem to have
[1:30:11] good outcomes
[1:30:13] you know
[1:30:18] on the surface you still with me
[1:30:21] i know it's wednesday but hang on
[1:30:24] swimming against the current
[1:30:27] not caring about what people will say
[1:30:29] now listen to me young people because
[1:30:30] i'm really going to help you here
[1:30:33] following your dreams
[1:30:36] all sounds good right yeah
[1:30:39] but let me tell you what a man almost 60
[1:30:41] here
[1:30:42] can tell you about that
[1:30:45] how many famous people
[1:30:49] this morning
[1:30:52] as you lifted your eyes from sleep
[1:30:55] they lifted their eyes in hell
[1:30:58] amen
[1:31:00] today
[1:31:01] this morning
[1:31:03] and they've been there now
[1:31:05] nigh on to
[1:31:07] 14 hours
[1:31:09] when i woke up at 6 00 a.m
[1:31:13] you know where i woke up in the same
[1:31:15] place i went to sleep
[1:31:18] there was a lot of other famous people
[1:31:20] and not so famous people in the world
[1:31:22] who also woke up but not where they went
[1:31:25] to sleep
[1:31:27] that
[1:31:28] is a fact
[1:31:31] that's not a story or disney or a movie
[1:31:34] or a game that's for real
[1:31:37] and you don't get a respawn
[1:31:40] you don't get to reset
[1:31:43] that's for real
[1:31:46] swim against the current
[1:31:48] follow your dreams
[1:31:50] how many hollywood stars have i heard
[1:31:53] say that
[1:31:55] in my life
[1:31:57] oh i just how did you get so successful
[1:31:58] oh i just followed my dream i just
[1:32:00] wouldn't let anybody stop me i just i
[1:32:02] just i just ignored all the naysayers
[1:32:05] and now here they are rich and famous
[1:32:09] and if they died in that condition
[1:32:11] they're going to lift their head up in
[1:32:13] hell
[1:32:14] [Music]
[1:32:16] because they know nothing of god at all
[1:32:19] see
[1:32:20] how many i'm telling you real stories
[1:32:22] friends how many music industry stars
[1:32:25] have i heard in my lifetime make those
[1:32:28] kinds of statements
[1:32:31] absolutely how many sports icons have i
[1:32:35] heard say that
[1:32:36] how many of them to this day here we are
[1:32:41] what is today the 22nd
[1:32:43] and we go back i can just go back 10
[1:32:46] years and just put a bullet list up here
[1:32:48] of famous movie stars and famous sports
[1:32:51] stars and famous music industry stars
[1:32:54] who have been lifting who followed their
[1:32:56] dreams and chased it and made these kind
[1:32:58] of decisions and ignored god in their
[1:33:01] life and have been lifting their eyes in
[1:33:03] hell for the last
[1:33:05] decade amen
[1:33:08] and when they had their big party saying
[1:33:10] oh he's looking down oh she's looking
[1:33:12] down they weren't they were looking up
[1:33:14] screaming
[1:33:15] they weren't looking down smiling they
[1:33:17] were looking up screaming
[1:33:19] because they weren't up there they were
[1:33:21] down there that's a bible fact
[1:33:26] and you need to come sometimes to the
[1:33:28] house of god the house of judgment and
[1:33:31] hear that fact
[1:33:33] amen see amen
[1:33:39] yet it's the battle cry of people
[1:33:42] it's incredible how many people
[1:33:45] you know in this day and hour that we
[1:33:47] live in that's almost like the the thing
[1:33:50] that everybody lives by they're people
[1:33:52] who who believe
[1:33:54] who believe this way
[1:33:57] are literally celebrated for it you know
[1:33:59] where i want to ask the question where
[1:34:01] is god's word as guides in their life
[1:34:05] people
[1:34:06] people sit in churches
[1:34:09] and hear the word of god preached
[1:34:11] multiple times a week even in message
[1:34:13] churches
[1:34:15] and hear the gospel preached multiple
[1:34:17] times a week and yet they live every day
[1:34:20] with carnal edges on their testimony
[1:34:23] they make choices in their lives
[1:34:26] it's very obvious that the lord was not
[1:34:28] consulted or either his answer wasn't
[1:34:31] followed
[1:34:32] amen
[1:34:33] and i'm here to tell you something
[1:34:35] friends as long as i'm your shepherd i
[1:34:36] will not shy away from that
[1:34:40] amen
[1:34:42] i i want you there
[1:34:44] too bad to shy away from it
[1:34:48] i was stunned with an article the other
[1:34:50] day i saw in the news one of the leading
[1:34:51] elite
[1:34:53] missed somebody i don't know who she was
[1:34:56] and she was she had a she had she was
[1:34:58] making headlines and everybody's
[1:34:59] applauding her because she made this
[1:35:01] statement she she showed up at some big
[1:35:03] event and i have no idea what it was i
[1:35:05] certainly didn't look at it but i was
[1:35:06] just reading the headline and she shows
[1:35:08] up at some big hollywood gala and she's
[1:35:10] got on
[1:35:12] even what even what even what common
[1:35:14] people thought was that's pretty
[1:35:16] indecent
[1:35:18] you know what she said to them and they
[1:35:19] wrote it in headlines and are applauding
[1:35:21] her for it said people who think that
[1:35:23] are brainwashed
[1:35:25] i just say you're right you are right
[1:35:29] i've been my mind has been washed clean
[1:35:32] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:35:35] hallelujah go ahead and laugh at it go
[1:35:37] ahead and make fun go ahead and go ahead
[1:35:39] and keep god out of your decisions
[1:35:42] not me
[1:35:44] go ahead sit in churches sit in message
[1:35:46] churches sit in this message church and
[1:35:48] hear it week after week after week and
[1:35:50] stay edgy and stay carnal and keep
[1:35:52] victory out of your home and see you'll
[1:35:54] see what see how that turns out for you
[1:35:57] see what happens to your children
[1:36:00] i'm here to tell you not in my house not
[1:36:02] under my watch i'm here to preach the
[1:36:04] gospel i'm here to tell you there's a
[1:36:06] way that's right and there's a way
[1:36:08] that's wrong
[1:36:14] see people make so many decisions
[1:36:16] overwhelmingly with little to no regard
[1:36:18] for what a prophet taught i mean you go
[1:36:20] you stare at the divorce rates just in
[1:36:22] this nation alone and you can see right
[1:36:24] away that nobody has regard for a
[1:36:26] prophet saying you should wait and pray
[1:36:28] and get a word from the lord and wait
[1:36:30] until
[1:36:32] see they the divorce got so bad they
[1:36:35] finally just started living in sin
[1:36:36] together don't even get married at all
[1:36:38] it's obvious america hasn't taken the
[1:36:40] warning of elijah
[1:36:41] who told them that
[1:36:43] god's vindicated prophet warned against
[1:36:46] god's vindicated prophet warned against
[1:36:48] chasing
[1:36:50] after science and education he warned us
[1:36:52] against that
[1:36:54] he warned us against brother branham
[1:36:56] called civilization over the devil
[1:36:59] amen
[1:37:00] and and proved that he proved to even
[1:37:03] the common man that the the more
[1:37:06] knowledge they get the more death is
[1:37:08] associated with it and that's
[1:37:09] incontrovertible
[1:37:11] you can't even deny that
[1:37:14] look on the streets friends look on the
[1:37:16] streets of just this small city and tell
[1:37:18] me you know if if if this teaching
[1:37:22] the real bible the real word is even
[1:37:25] regarded hardly at all amen
[1:37:28] just in this little fair city
[1:37:30] just in our little seaside town
[1:37:33] you'll see right away that a prophet's
[1:37:34] message is almost not regarded at all
[1:37:36] except by the believers brother branham
[1:37:38] listen listen friends listen brother
[1:37:40] branham wasn't really so much hard on
[1:37:43] sinners of his day he actually he would
[1:37:45] even say things like you know don't take
[1:37:46] away their pleasures it's the only thing
[1:37:48] they have
[1:37:49] that was his attitude towards sinners he
[1:37:51] loved them
[1:37:52] you know
[1:37:53] but brother branham said what you do is
[1:37:55] you try to show something you try to
[1:37:56] show them something of greater value
[1:38:00] you try to show them a higher life
[1:38:02] see
[1:38:03] and so you know he didn't name his
[1:38:05] arrows at famous sinners of his days
[1:38:08] brother branham didn't it we what
[1:38:10] brother branham shot his arrows at was
[1:38:12] the impersonation of christianity
[1:38:16] that's what he was against he wasn't
[1:38:17] against the sinner
[1:38:19] he was against thee and now he would
[1:38:21] talk about ernie ford and and all those
[1:38:23] get on there and said in the honky tonk
[1:38:25] on friday and in the church choir on
[1:38:26] sunday
[1:38:28] amen see and pat boone and elvis presley
[1:38:31] and all of them sold their birthright
[1:38:32] for a fleet of cadillacs you know it it
[1:38:35] it was the impersonation he he was he
[1:38:38] was never that troubled you know about
[1:38:40] the famous people of his day two of the
[1:38:42] most famous women of brother branham's
[1:38:43] day was jackie kennedy and marilyn
[1:38:45] monroe
[1:38:47] and brother branham spoke
[1:38:48] compassionately about them he said you
[1:38:50] know he said mrs kennedy shouldn't do
[1:38:52] the things she does he said but maybe if
[1:38:55] she ever heard one of these messages of
[1:38:57] mine she might straighten up maybe she's
[1:38:58] never heard one of my messages see
[1:39:02] and he talked about marilyn monroe very
[1:39:04] efficiently said i wish i could have got
[1:39:05] to or said the child
[1:39:07] had a heart attack trying to reach for
[1:39:08] the phone
[1:39:10] and he said i wish i could have got to
[1:39:11] her he said i think i could have showed
[1:39:13] her something that that might have
[1:39:15] attracted her you know it so it wasn't
[1:39:18] it wasn't jackie kennedy
[1:39:20] that troubled brother branham it wasn't
[1:39:22] marilyn monroe that troubled him what
[1:39:24] troubled him and made him lash out was
[1:39:27] people of god who were supposed to be
[1:39:30] christians admiring them and copying
[1:39:33] their lifestyle
[1:39:36] in the churches and calling themselves
[1:39:38] believers you know it becomes rather
[1:39:41] obvious that a consciousness that this
[1:39:44] is just a temporary training gown
[1:39:46] training ground is absent from their
[1:39:48] minds it's missing because people even
[1:39:51] though a prophet proved that
[1:39:52] civilization is of the devil and he
[1:39:54] proved there's more death everybody's
[1:39:56] still chasing it it goes to show you
[1:39:58] that man's mind is not aware this is
[1:40:01] just a temporary stopover
[1:40:04] this life isn't even about this one it's
[1:40:06] just a proving field a training field a
[1:40:09] proving ground
[1:40:10] the life coming that's the life to live
[1:40:14] for friends
[1:40:18] i'm gonna point out some good truths and
[1:40:20] then i'm to ask you a question
[1:40:22] so be ready to consider something
[1:40:26] here's the first fact i want to give you
[1:40:29] there is a real god

[1:40:35] explaining more than that i don't need
[1:40:37] to he is
[1:40:40] there is a real god who is who is what
[1:40:43] preacher who is what who is holy
[1:40:47] there is a real god who is righteous

[1:40:57] you
[1:40:58] a god who will save you from the
[1:41:00] judgments that are rushing to meet us
[1:41:05] this is a god listen friends
[1:41:08] listen to this
[1:41:09] this is a god who can actually put you
[1:41:12] on a path
[1:41:13] if you can find your way to god's main
[1:41:16] current amen
[1:41:20] that current can put you on a path
[1:41:23] that the results of your decision can be
[1:41:25] fully known in advance
[1:41:27] [Music]
[1:41:29] fully known in advance whether it will
[1:41:31] have a good ending or a bad ending fully
[1:41:33] known in advance what it will produce
[1:41:36] and can tell you
[1:41:38] now you ready i told you to ask you a
[1:41:40] question who wants that
[1:41:43] who wants that
[1:41:45] i'm talking about a main current of god
[1:41:48] that if you slip and manage to get into
[1:41:50] that slipstream
[1:41:52] that main current of god that's headed
[1:41:54] for zion i'm here to tell you it'll
[1:41:56] carry you all the way
[1:41:58] and it'll take you in this life and
[1:42:00] it'll give you the it'll look at the
[1:42:01] decisions you're going to make today and
[1:42:03] it'll tell you the outcome you're going
[1:42:04] to have tomorrow with pinpoint accuracy
[1:42:09] just as accurate as enoch's pyramid
[1:42:14] see
[1:42:16] i'm i'm i'm done i'm going to close
[1:42:18] right now

[1:42:30] in one of these situations
[1:42:35] i have work and school
[1:42:38] and hobbies
[1:42:39] and my social friendships
[1:42:41] and i'll come to church when i can
[1:42:53] how do you think
[1:42:55] your decision
[1:42:57] will impact you
[1:42:59] and those involved
[1:43:02] if you think
[1:43:03] like that
[1:43:04] amen

[1:43:09] i have school
[1:43:10] i have hobbies i have social friendships
[1:43:13] i'll come to church when i can
[1:43:21] or it might sound like this
[1:43:24] i'm an adult
[1:43:26] with my own family
[1:43:28] and i don't need ministers bawling me
[1:43:30] out and telling me what to do
[1:43:38] amen
[1:43:40] do you think that's the best choice you
[1:43:42] can make
[1:43:44] be honest
[1:43:45] my sermon's over this is it these are my
[1:43:48] last slides
[1:43:50] i'm an adult
[1:43:52] with my own family
[1:43:54] i don't need ministers bawling me out
[1:43:58] and telling me what to do
[1:44:00] in love
[1:44:02] because i love you and look you right in
[1:44:04] the eye
[1:44:05] and i rarely do that
[1:44:08] do you think this is the best choice you
[1:44:10] could make
[1:44:15] pastor i don't need to be more spiritual
[1:44:18] i can be a christian and still dress
[1:44:21] like
[1:44:22] fake christians
[1:44:30] is that what you really
[1:44:32] want
[1:44:33] i just want to be free to live in sin

[1:45:06] you sure you want a pastor who never
[1:45:08] does that
[1:45:12] you think you don't need to be spiritual
[1:45:14] you can just be the kind of level of
[1:45:16] christian that's one of these fake ones
[1:45:18] that the world is
[1:45:22] or maybe you're just
[1:45:24] being dead on us tonight and just saying
