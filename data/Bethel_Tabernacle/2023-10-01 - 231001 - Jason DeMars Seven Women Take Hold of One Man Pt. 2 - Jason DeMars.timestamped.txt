[12:08] these um nominal Christian singers they
[12:11] get inspired and that's a true anointing
[12:13] from

[12:20] so that the bride can be blessed
[12:23] throughout the Nations and so this one I
[12:26] think is one of the songs that was

[32:02] praise the Lord
[32:04] God is good
[32:06] amen wanna be thankful to be back with
[32:09] you again
[32:12] long time traveling and on the road
[32:16] it feels good to be home
[32:19] with the with the home folk now
[32:22] it took a little while to get there from
[32:25] my Minnesota Roots but it feels like
[32:27] home now so
[32:28] praise the Lord
[32:29] I'm going to bring up the PowerPoint I
[32:32] want to continue on the
[32:34] subject from a long time ago I guess I'm
[32:37] sure you have perfect memory of
[32:38] everything I preached about two months
[32:41] ago seven women take hold of one man
[32:46] speak on that subject continue on and
[32:48] since it was so long ago I'll probably
[32:50] repeat a fair portion of that but if you
[32:53] bring that PowerPoint up as we do we're
[32:55] going to read Isaiah chapter 4.
[32:59] and
[33:01] every time I I've spoken on this in
[33:04] different places
[33:06] there's always been
[33:09] the devil hates this word
[33:12] the devil hates homes that are in order
[33:15] the devil hates
[33:17] homes that are passing that order onto
[33:20] their the children
[33:22] he hates it he's he's battling against
[33:24] it
[33:25] in the western world there's been
[33:28] and a multi-faceted Onslaught against
[33:31] the roles of men and women marriage
[33:34] child bearing and the vision that we
[33:37] raise our children with
[33:40] every direction this this fight in this
[33:43] battle has come and so we we should
[33:47] expect that when we go into the word of
[33:49] God and point these things out that the
[33:53] enemy would hate that and would attack
[33:55] it and would move against it I think as
[33:58] we've come further on now in this day
[34:01] we realize how
[34:05] deceptive it is how can you arrive at
[34:08] this place where they don't know what a
[34:10] man or a woman is let alone what their
[34:13] roles are how did we get this far well
[34:16] it was a deception that started and
[34:17] there was a prophet that God sent to
[34:20] point out this deception
[34:22] and the world said what nonsense what an
[34:26] old crank what an old fogy
[34:29] but the it's it's the reality that
[34:31] brother Branham brought us
[34:33] a truth and unfortunately
[34:37] um when we hear it because of the
[34:39] culture that we live and are surrounded
[34:41] in and the entertainment that we're
[34:44] around and the educational system and
[34:46] all of these things that are surrounding
[34:48] us when we hear it we go oof well
[34:51] brother branham's you know we can soften
[34:53] that a little bit
[34:54] and so I don't believe that we should
[34:56] soften it I think we should go in and
[34:58] find out why he said it scripturally
[35:00] place it and see see why it's so
[35:04] important that he would bring out these
[35:06] things
[35:08] I'm not here
[35:10] in my mind I'm not here to preach
[35:13] against anybody or if you feel like I'm
[35:15] poking at you I'm not poking you
[35:18] I love the Lord I would I would rather
[35:21] die
[35:22] than to go against his will I spent all
[35:25] last night and this morning trying to
[35:28] run away from this subject somehow
[35:30] and find another way I'll do it another
[35:32] time I'll do it another thing and I just
[35:34] I know that this is what the Lord wants
[35:36] me to preach about and I'll leave it at
[35:38] that place so
[35:40] I'm going to read the scripture so you
[35:42] can sit down and then I'll talk to you
[35:43] some more
[35:46] Isaiah
[35:48] chapter 4.
[35:51] and verse 1 and 2. and in that day seven
[35:54] women shall take hold of one man saying
[35:56] we will eat our own bread and wear our
[35:59] own apparel
[36:00] only let us be called by thy name to
[36:02] take away our reproach in that day shall
[36:05] the branch of the Lord be beautiful and
[36:06] glorious
[36:07] and the fruit of the Earth shall be
[36:09] excellent and comely for them that are
[36:11] escaped of Israel
[36:13] gracious Heavenly Father we come before
[36:15] you Lord and we're so thankful for your
[36:16] word Lord we're so thankful
[36:18] for a Vindicated interpretation of that
[36:21] word in this day Lord and that you've
[36:23] pointed out so clearly
[36:25] a prophetically in the message
[36:27] that if we have eyes to see and ears to
[36:30] hear we can receive it and be on our
[36:32] guard against the attacks of the enemy
[36:34] we understand the attacks of the enemy
[36:36] are coming from every direction
[36:38] and we should under we should realize
[36:40] where it's coming from
[36:43] and block those places where the enemy
[36:45] is attacking
[36:46] but even even greater than that I
[36:48] believe that as Overcomers will go on
[36:50] the offensive
[36:51] we're not here simply to be pounded to
[36:55] death
[36:56] and to sort of kind of win the battle
[36:59] but we're
[37:00] here to pound back at the enemy
[37:03] and to show that he's a liar and he's a
[37:06] deceiver and that he's come to destroy
[37:09] and to kill
[37:11] you Lord I pray that your Holy Spirit
[37:13] would take control of me
[37:15] okay to take control of every heart
[37:17] take control of the spiritual atmosphere
[37:20] surrounding this this building Lord may
[37:23] your presence come Lord in me the spirit
[37:25] of Revelation be operating at every
[37:27] heart we commit ourselves and we give
[37:29] ourselves to you we ask this in the name
[37:31] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[37:34] God bless you can be seated
[37:41] there's a
[37:43] there is an evil spirit
[37:46] working in this age actually there's
[37:49] uh
[37:51] Millions numerous
[37:53] Satan has a has an army
[37:56] that he is commanding and operating
[37:59] through and he works through government
[38:03] he works through culture civilization
[38:07] education he works through
[38:10] uh newspapers
[38:12] online media social media and he is the
[38:17] driving force behind the
[38:21] viewpoints that are put forward in
[38:24] politics in this day
[38:27] whether it be
[38:29] a Godless Democrat Party or a Godless
[38:32] Republican Party
[38:34] both of them are playing into the hands
[38:38] of the devil
[38:39] and the enemy and we can't look to
[38:42] politics per se
[38:45] for our salvation
[38:47] or for the Redemption of our society
[38:51] the Republicans aren't going to fix our
[38:53] society Donald Trump is not going to
[38:54] repair
[38:56] our homes
[38:58] and the the educational system or
[39:01] anything really for that matter other
[39:03] than maybe the economy
[39:06] when we can't look to that and we can't
[39:08] expect that to be the case we as
[39:11] Christians have to take a hold of the
[39:14] word of God because it's a sword and we
[39:16] have to cut our way through the enemy's
[39:18] lies
[39:20] and I'm I'm here to express to you don't
[39:24] think that there's innocent forms of
[39:27] entertainment
[39:28] everything has a message everything has
[39:31] a presentation everything is trying to
[39:34] put a picture in your mind you say oh
[39:37] it's Disney it's no big deal it's this
[39:40] little thing they have an agenda
[39:42] and it it's not this agenda
[39:46] whether it be whether it's Disney or fox
[39:48] or whatever yeah
[39:50] they're all the same thing and they're
[39:52] all controlled by the same
[39:54] evil spirit and just a few different
[39:56] families frankly
[39:58] and they have a message and it isn't a
[40:00] message that comes from Malachi 4.
[40:06] and so when when we look at any kind of
[40:09] media we should understand this basic
[40:13] fact this basic reality
[40:16] is that there is a there is a message
[40:18] being proclaimed to you be on guard and
[40:21] search it by the word
[40:23] all these I don't want to get off on a
[40:26] tangent let's go back let's go back and
[40:28] look what brother Branham says in uh
[40:32] the invasion of the United States I read
[40:35] this message from 1954 what an
[40:39] incredible
[40:40] prophetic statement is being made here
[40:44] you know we read brother Brandon we
[40:45] think he's just preaching
[40:47] look at what he is saying it is
[40:49] incredible go back and re listen to this
[40:52] or read this message the invasion of the
[40:55] United States because he's telling you
[40:56] exactly what's happening right now
[40:59] you know the United States has more
[41:01] divorce divorce cases than all the rest
[41:04] of the world more divorces think of it
[41:06] that horrible the motherhood has been
[41:09] broken
[41:10] mothers don't stay home no more with
[41:12] their children like they used to they
[41:14] got to have a job
[41:16] here the other day a certain grocery man
[41:18] in this city was talking to me about it
[41:20] these women working in this public
[41:21] plants young married women with a bunch
[41:24] of little kids they got babysitters
[41:25] taking care of their babies they work in
[41:28] the public places said there was two of
[41:30] them standing there when they got laid
[41:32] off at their Public Works said don't
[41:33] worry we'll make it anyhow
[41:36] oh such an hour listen to what brother
[41:38] Branham says now after he says this
[41:41] makes that statement oh such an hour of
[41:44] prostitution at hand
[41:47] the devil has done told them that
[41:49] they're the boss of the house they'll
[41:51] make their own money they'll do what
[41:53] they wish to and you get it out of them
[41:55] if you can
[41:57] there's only one thing can get it out of
[41:59] them that's the altar before Jesus
[42:01] Christ an old-fashioned tear stream
[42:03] religion that'll break their hearts and
[42:05] tear them to pieces and make them what
[42:07] they ought to be that's right they may
[42:09] think I'm just an old fogy but the day
[42:12] when you're dying my brother
[42:14] sister you realize that I told you the
[42:17] truth that's right
[42:19] my goodness
[42:21] so as we see what brother Brandon is
[42:23] speaking this isn't an isolated thing
[42:25] you look this and you can search it up
[42:27] and over and over again
[42:29] he speaks about this
[42:31] and it's what what uh it's so critical
[42:35] for us to understand this in this hour
[42:37] because this is the place this is a
[42:40] place of the onslaught you see as
[42:42] Christians so many times we we know we
[42:45] read this and we know okay that's the
[42:47] truth but understand is
[42:49] what can replace
[42:52] a mother in the home
[42:56] what can replace that what what a man
[42:58] can't do it
[43:01] no he can't do that what can replace the
[43:05] value
[43:06] of a mother in the home
[43:09] you know I my mother has passed on to
[43:12] her reward
[43:14] and there isn't hardly a day goes by
[43:16] that I don't think about her and thank
[43:18] God for her
[43:20] you know she
[43:22] she was a extremely intelligent
[43:25] woman
[43:26] she could have done anything and she
[43:29] and my dad said she could have done
[43:31] anything she wanted to and then all of
[43:32] the kids respond she did exactly what
[43:35] she wanted to
[43:36] she was a mom
[43:38] she raised her kids she took care of her
[43:40] husband
[43:44] I'm a blessed man because of that
[43:46] and I'm still I'm still a blessed man
[43:50] I have a wife at home taking care of my
[43:52] children
[43:56] and we look at that and say oh
[43:58] well
[44:00] she didn't have her career she didn't
[44:02] have this what where is this thinking
[44:05] coming from you you you you you
[44:07] automatically think that
[44:10] why is it because that's what you've
[44:12] been preached at in society for the last
[44:14] 75 years 80 years
[44:17] this is the direction
[44:19] that the world has pushed us but I I
[44:22] want to say is this type of thinking who
[44:25] where where what source is it where is
[44:26] it coming from what's the purpose I
[44:28] understand there's exceptions to
[44:30] everything and there's problems we don't
[44:31] live in a perfect world
[44:34] and think things happen but we shouldn't
[44:36] make everything an exception see when
[44:38] you make everything an exception then
[44:40] that's where you're literally not
[44:43] believing God's word anymore
[44:46] and so let's look and see how God
[44:48] created man and woman in the beginning
[44:51] and we can understand the role and
[44:55] purpose that God has for them and young
[44:57] men as I'm preaching this is don't think
[45:00] I'm just well the ladies can just listen
[45:02] uh it doesn't matter to me you are the
[45:05] guardian
[45:07] in the home of this
[45:09] it's not up to your wife to set things
[45:11] in order you must set in an order
[45:14] you must make sure that these things are
[45:16] happening it's on you it's not on your
[45:18] wife
[45:21] you you have to lead you have to guard
[45:23] you have to keep the Lord God took the
[45:25] man Genesis 2 15 and put him into the
[45:27] Garden of Eden to dress it
[45:30] and to keep it
[45:33] interesting we look at this and I
[45:35] personally have always read this verse
[45:37] and simply said oh he's it's uh this is
[45:40] his responsibility Over the Garden of
[45:42] Eden yeah
[45:44] sort of but that's not the whole picture
[45:47] what's in the Garden of Eden his wife
[45:51] to be his family
[45:52] right what else is in the Garden of Eden
[45:55] a devil
[45:57] you know you think my goodness he's in
[45:59] Paradise why does what does he need to
[46:01] work and and guard
[46:04] God made man to work
[46:08] even in a place of perfection where God
[46:10] had provided everything in the Garden of
[46:12] Eden the fruit was there the vegetables
[46:15] were there the herbs were there
[46:16] presumably man would have to do nothing
[46:18] initially to eat because God had
[46:22] provided it there but yet God says even
[46:25] to this man in Paradise work
[46:28] why because idleness leads to
[46:30] all kinds of evils all sorts of evils
[46:33] the worst perversions happen in people
[46:35] that are too idle look at America today
[46:38] look at what the aristocracy in England
[46:41] devolved to
[46:42] every man had a uh his prostitute and
[46:46] maybe male lovers female lovers all
[46:49] kinds of things why because they had no
[46:50] work to do
[46:51] yeah they weren't employing themselves
[46:53] and God never made a man to be lazy
[46:56] he made him to work that's this very
[46:58] word
[46:59] to dress
[47:01] means to a service a work performed and
[47:05] they're vanished they're vanished the
[47:06] PowerPoint a work performed or made for
[47:09] another
[47:10] out of obligation
[47:14] requirement or gratitude see God had
[47:18] placed over man a stewardship and he was
[47:21] to work in this stewardship he was to be
[47:24] the manager of God's creation
[47:27] he was to be the leader he was to be
[47:29] head
[47:30] the headship of man is not a result of
[47:33] the Fall the headship is a part of the
[47:36] original design
[47:40] God designed it in the very beginning to
[47:43] be this way and he was also to keep it
[47:46] the word keep means to guard
[47:51] a close watching of something for
[47:53] guarding or protecting
[47:54] Shepherds constructed Corrals of Briars
[47:57] at night to protect the flock from
[47:58] predators
[47:59] a guard to keep watch over or guard in
[48:03] the sense of preserving
[48:06] so there we see the purpose of the Lord
[48:09] in creating the man he made him to be a
[48:13] guardian to be a preserver to be a
[48:16] protector
[48:17] that's your purpose man
[48:20] that's your purpose young man what are
[48:22] you supposed to do you're supposed to
[48:23] learn how to work and provide for a
[48:26] family and how to guard and protect and
[48:28] preserve that's why you're a young man
[48:31] growing to serve the Lord is that what
[48:33] you're supposed to do
[48:34] well I don't I'm supposed to play video
[48:36] games no you're not supposed to play
[48:38] video games
[48:40] that that's done more for the deadening
[48:42] of manhood than anything I can imagine
[48:44] get outside and work
[48:47] God has designed us to work
[48:51] in any any kind of
[48:54] unoccupied time that's many times that's
[48:57] how the devil operates in people
[49:01] they have no purpose they have no vision
[49:03] you have a vision
[49:06] it's to learn how to work
[49:09] you have you have a purpose it's learn
[49:10] how to protect and provide for a family
[49:13] and to guard them and this is not just
[49:15] physical guarding this is spiritual
[49:17] guarding you need to have vision
[49:20] God is placed in
[49:22] us as men we need to have vision and see
[49:26] the big picture
[49:28] and give the warning give say this is
[49:32] going to lead to this thing we have to
[49:34] stop that we have to change that we have
[49:36] to be under correction
[49:38] all right
[49:42] Genesis 2 24 there therefore shall a man
[49:45] leave his father
[49:46] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[49:48] wife
[49:50] and they shall be one flesh
[49:55] amen the true Oneness is between a
[49:58] husband and wife you know we have our
[50:01] cute sayings that we say well we're not
[50:02] losing a daughter but we're gaining a
[50:04] son-in-law no you are giving a DOT your
[50:07] daughter to another man
[50:09] you're giving the daughter to a man and
[50:11] the God is creating a new family through
[50:14] them and that's where the priority lies
[50:16] is on that new family they shall be one
[50:19] flesh not your whole family
[50:23] and people use that as a way of
[50:25] manipulation and control no let them be
[50:28] a family
[50:29] let them grow on their own
[50:34] all right
[50:38] and the Lord God said it is not good
[50:41] that the man should be alone
[50:43] I will make him and help meet for him
[50:50] so when God created man the very first
[50:53] job he gave him to do was to work
[50:56] and to guard
[50:58] from the attacks of the enemy physical
[51:00] and spiritual
[51:03] when he made the woman what did he do he
[51:05] he pointed out here that it was not good
[51:09] for the man to be alone the very first
[51:11] thing in the perfect Paradise that was
[51:13] not good was man being alone
[51:16] it's not right for man to be alone
[51:19] so he made a help meet for him
[51:24] help speaks of Aid or assisting
[51:28] meat speaks of as before him or one like
[51:31] him in other words a helper who is like
[51:35] him
[51:36] so when God designed created a woman
[51:38] created her to be a helper
[51:41] to help the man
[51:43] to do what the man is called to do
[51:47] and he made them one one purpose one
[51:50] envision
[51:53] all right
[51:56] First Timothy 2 12-14
[52:00] but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to
[52:03] usurp authority over the man but to be
[52:05] in silence for Adam was first form then
[52:08] Eve and Adam was not deceived but the
[52:10] woman being deceived was in the
[52:12] transgression that's where I see in
[52:14] Scripture that God's design before the
[52:17] fall was for man to be had
[52:21] to lead and for Eve to submit
[52:25] right and Adam's purpose was to guard
[52:29] and to work and provide to provide
[52:32] and her purpose was to be the helper
[52:34] right and so this is bigger than the
[52:36] picture of well we shouldn't believe in
[52:38] women preachers there's a whole
[52:41] whole thing that goes into this
[52:44] there's headship and creation and God's
[52:46] purpose for Christ and the bride you
[52:49] don't have the bride preaching to Christ
[52:51] you have pride Christ bringing the word
[52:54] to the bride
[52:56] vindicating that word and being the head
[52:58] being the leader you don't have the
[53:00] bride leading Christ Christ is the head
[53:04] he leads the bride
[53:06] first Peter 3 7 likewise your husbands
[53:09] dwell with them according to knowledge
[53:10] giving honor unto the wife as unto the
[53:12] weaker vessel and as being heirs
[53:14] together of the grace of life that your
[53:17] prayers be not hindered we shouldn't be
[53:19] offended at the word of God the Bible
[53:21] says a woman is a weaker vessel
[53:23] that's the truth
[53:26] and husbands have to give honor unto her
[53:29] unto her because she's the weak of
[53:30] weaker vessel and because your heirs
[53:33] together of the grace of life
[53:36] all right
[53:40] proverbs 31 virtuous woman
[53:43] we're not going to read the scripture we
[53:44] did it the last time we went over this
[53:46] but it speaks of the attributes of the
[53:49] virtuous woman
[53:51] it says she's trustworthy she seeks wool
[53:54] and flax she willingly works with her
[53:55] hands she plans and provides a variety
[53:58] of foods for her family
[54:00] she Rises early in the morning to
[54:02] prepare a meal for the family she works
[54:03] along with her husband to expand
[54:05] household business where she considers a
[54:07] field and buys it plants a Vineyard
[54:10] she inspects the things her household is
[54:12] producing and will do what it takes to
[54:13] make sure that it's quality
[54:16] she works on providing clothing for a
[54:18] family
[54:19] she has a heart to provide for the poor
[54:22] she doesn't fear various seasons of life
[54:24] because she makes provision for them
[54:27] she prospers from hard work and so does
[54:29] her family her husband is honored
[54:31] because of her
[54:33] she not only supplies for the needs of
[54:35] her family she makes additional
[54:37] materials and sells them
[54:39] she's a strong and honorable woman she's
[54:41] wise and kind she's not idle or lazy and
[54:45] her focus is not on outward Beauty and
[54:47] charm but on the character produced by
[54:49] the fear of the Lord you look at that
[54:52] and you see and understand there's you
[54:54] see the scriptural balance in this
[54:59] there's a vision together for the
[55:01] household
[55:02] for the husband and wife
[55:04] there's not one career over here and one
[55:06] career over here
[55:08] but there's a vision to gather that
[55:10] you're working towards
[55:15] now we look at this world look at what
[55:17] brother Branham says
[55:18] as we spoke about at the start I want to
[55:21] start putting the details on this
[55:24] in the Rapture he says my my hall
[55:27] education and wisdom this world has
[55:28] turned the church into a bunch of
[55:30] ragweeds
[55:31] it's education and the educational
[55:33] system science and civilization is of
[55:36] the devil it's the devil's civilization
[55:39] the Bible said so
[55:42] amen
[55:43] so we can look at that and we can see
[55:45] that
[55:46] but do we see how
[55:49] because it's great to see okay education
[55:51] science and civilization is all of the
[55:53] devil
[55:54] but how is the devil working because
[55:56] it's one thing to say it and then it's
[55:59] one thing to live your life battling
[56:01] against the enemy if you don't know what
[56:02] the enemy is doing how will you fight
[56:04] against him
[56:05] how you battle against him you're just
[56:07] blind
[56:08] you're not seeing the reality of what's
[56:11] creeping in and again
[56:13] Satan never works by just showing new
[56:17] well everybody
[56:19] our goal is to have you all all you men
[56:22] dressing like women
[56:24] and all of you women dressing like men
[56:26] that's our that's our goal because we
[56:28] want to destroy
[56:30] everything in this Society
[56:33] and and if they came at the beginning
[56:34] just imagine 1910 somebody announces
[56:38] that to everybody they say okay here's a
[56:40] place for you to live
[56:41] in the crazy house
[56:45] that's but that's exactly what happened
[56:47] they slowly took us to this direction
[56:51] that was Satan's Satan's purpose
[56:56] and so now
[56:58] remember that the devil is still
[57:01] preaching his Gospel of feminism
[57:06] he's still preaching his what he's he's
[57:09] trying to pull your minds off of the
[57:12] vision that God has for your life
[57:16] and you can get sidetracked on every
[57:19] direction when you miss God's Simple
[57:21] Plan God's simple purpose
[57:24] this isn't complicated I should I should
[57:26] be able to take five minutes and just
[57:28] say and you'd be like oh yeah that's
[57:29] exactly right let's move on with our
[57:31] lives but because the talons of the
[57:35] enemy have sunk so deep
[57:38] in everything that we do
[57:40] we have to labor on this and point out
[57:43] this and show
[57:45] believe me I'd like to come and just
[57:47] encourage you and have everybody walking
[57:48] out oh I'm just rejoicing and happy Oh I
[57:51] love it when brother Jason preaches
[57:52] every time I always feel so light on
[57:55] light-hearted
[57:57] the Lord has not made me that way he's
[57:59] not ordained me that way he's not sent
[58:01] me that way
[58:02] and so
[58:03] you just pray for me
[58:09] God love God God loves us and because he
[58:12] loves us
[58:13] he sends correction
[58:17] so
[58:19] cultures change
[58:22] but the word of God does not change
[58:25] so we went through this before I'm just
[58:27] going to do it as briefly as I can
[58:29] but there there's been a progression
[58:31] away from
[58:33] living
[58:34] the way God designed us to live on this
[58:37] Earth to the place we're out today we're
[58:39] living in a world that's not of God
[58:43] it started out that there were farming
[58:46] societies divided into landowners and
[58:48] lower class
[58:50] up until the Industrial Revolution
[58:53] in the 1700s and 1800s husband and wife
[58:55] roles were clear obvious Undisputed
[58:59] then came that Industrial Revolution
[59:03] and the birth of the middle class
[59:05] rolls start out clear but to begin to
[59:09] get muddier
[59:10] and as the time of reproduct mass re
[59:13] mass production
[59:15] comes you see the start of the breakdown
[59:19] of society the breakdown of the home
[59:23] in the early 1900s
[59:26] up until even now that we're in the last
[59:28] 10 12 years the digital Revolution
[59:31] blurring the alliance to the point where
[59:33] none of it matters
[59:35] what are the rules what are we supposed
[59:37] to do what can what does god require of
[59:41] us what is God looking at for us well
[59:44] you can't really look to society to tell
[59:47] you that you'd have no idea what it is
[59:49] you can't look to conservative Society
[59:51] you can't look to Liberal Society you
[59:53] have to look straight to the word
[59:56] looking at these different things I'm
[59:58] not going to go over that but directly
[1:00:00] connected to this uh devolving this this
[1:00:05] downward spiral
[1:00:07] of
[1:00:09] family is connected
[1:00:12] at the very same time
[1:00:15] this process where the modesty of the
[1:00:20] woman is attacked and destroyed
[1:00:24] you come at the message from the angle
[1:00:27] that
[1:00:28] my we're so different than the world
[1:00:32] this is hard this is strange this is
[1:00:35] weird
[1:00:36] but the problem is as you're doing what
[1:00:39] God's people have always done yeah
[1:00:42] through all the ages
[1:00:43] that you're living in a world where it's
[1:00:46] literally Satan's Eden
[1:00:49] and women it's no problem
[1:00:51] what kind of old crazy person they just
[1:00:53] want to control you to tell you not to
[1:00:56] cut your hair to tell you not to wear
[1:00:58] makeup to tell you to wear a dress or a
[1:01:01] skirt instead of pants
[1:01:03] this is this is crazy what kind of
[1:01:06] Fanatics are they you're the Fanatics
[1:01:09] you're the crazy people undressing
[1:01:11] yourselves you've destroyed Society by
[1:01:14] this wickedness
[1:01:22] the first wave of feminism was the
[1:01:25] promotion of equal contract and property
[1:01:28] rights for women and the opposition to
[1:01:30] chattel marriage and ownership of
[1:01:31] married women and their children by
[1:01:33] their husbands however by the end of the
[1:01:35] 19th century activism focused primarily
[1:01:37] on gaining political power
[1:01:39] particularly the right of women's
[1:01:41] suffrage
[1:01:43] the second wave came was the women's
[1:01:46] liberation
[1:01:47] challenging the cultural and legal
[1:01:49] validity of patriarchy and the social
[1:01:52] and sexual hierarchies used to control
[1:01:54] and limit the legal and physical
[1:01:55] independence of women in society
[1:02:00] that's a whole mouthful
[1:02:02] and then the third wave is the freedom
[1:02:04] of sexual bodily expression fighting
[1:02:06] sexual harassment continued expression
[1:02:07] of women's rights by dismantling any
[1:02:10] gender roles whatsoever and we see the
[1:02:12] results today
[1:02:13] we see the results of this it's easy to
[1:02:16] see what the results are and you have
[1:02:18] men
[1:02:20] dressed up
[1:02:22] quote unquote sexily like women
[1:02:25] in schools
[1:02:27] grooming children
[1:02:30] and it's the enshrining of the rights of
[1:02:33] pedophiles that's what the next step is
[1:02:36] and it's it's a whole
[1:02:38] perversion you say well that's a lot
[1:02:40] different than women's rights I'm
[1:02:41] talking about the progression
[1:02:43] I'm talking about Satan's progress that
[1:02:46] he's made he was marching towards this
[1:02:48] right how did he start marching towards
[1:02:51] it get rid of modesty women can vote
[1:02:55] women don't need men
[1:02:58] here's the truth is
[1:03:00] men need women and women need men
[1:03:05] any other kind of idea is is a total lie
[1:03:09] women need the strength
[1:03:12] of men
[1:03:15] men need the Beauty and the dignifying
[1:03:18] effect of a woman
[1:03:20] in their life we need each other
[1:03:27] but as you as you look at this
[1:03:29] progression it's obvious to us
[1:03:32] but then we have to understand is how
[1:03:35] far has this impacted
[1:03:38] we we talk about
[1:03:41] this this scripture I'll just bring
[1:03:43] quickly it's the dangers look at this
[1:03:45] how how God looks at this
[1:03:48] First Corinthians 6 9 know ye not that
[1:03:50] the unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:03:51] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[1:03:54] fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers
[1:03:56] nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves
[1:03:59] with mankind
[1:04:01] and so Paul is saying effeminate men
[1:04:04] will not go to heaven is essentially
[1:04:06] what he's saying unless they repent and
[1:04:09] turn away from that wickedness
[1:04:12] because it is wickedness it's a
[1:04:14] perversion
[1:04:15] and God God hates it
[1:04:20] and as we as we as we look
[1:04:24] we see that our culture has become
[1:04:26] feminized
[1:04:29] it's come become feminized to the point
[1:04:31] where a real man is spoken of uh oh you
[1:04:37] know in horrible terms you can you can
[1:04:39] say anything you want about a real man
[1:04:41] but never
[1:04:43] never say a word about any woman
[1:04:46] because a woman transgenders perverts
[1:04:50] they're all enshrined as the ones that
[1:04:52] we protect and fight for
[1:04:56] and it's got everything opposite
[1:04:58] everything perverted man are are
[1:05:01] self-centered idiot and many times they
[1:05:03] are self-centered idiots
[1:05:06] it's true but that's what Society has
[1:05:09] pigeonholed them into and they have to
[1:05:12] be led by wise and Powerful women
[1:05:15] deadening of Manliness comes from the
[1:05:17] video game addiction and the
[1:05:19] proliferation of estrogens and food
[1:05:21] water and clothing he says Sciences of
[1:05:24] the devil
[1:05:25] science has developed these things and
[1:05:27] put them in our food food
[1:05:30] women work and lead the family the man
[1:05:31] works too but remains disconnected
[1:05:34] and unaware
[1:05:37] and then all masculinity is identified
[1:05:40] as toxic
[1:05:42] but the real thing that's toxic is the
[1:05:44] attack on true masculinity
[1:05:49] amen men respond to all of this as it's
[1:05:51] hopeless for me I will check out
[1:05:55] I'll just pay attention to the football
[1:05:56] and the hockey and the basketball game
[1:05:59] and the baseball game and the beers
[1:06:03] or else they become more like women
[1:06:06] because this this way at least I can get
[1:06:09] a little respect around here
[1:06:12] it's crazy
[1:06:15] brother Branham
[1:06:17] speaks about this perversion in the food
[1:06:19] supply
[1:06:21] he says do you read this here this
[1:06:22] month's reader digest that men and women
[1:06:24] of this day little girls from 20 or 25
[1:06:27] years old is in menopause
[1:06:29] that you go through the change of life
[1:06:31] in the middle age of life according to
[1:06:32] science between 20 and 25 used to be
[1:06:35] around 30 or 35 in my age in my mother's
[1:06:37] age a woman never struck menopause till
[1:06:39] she was 40 or 45 what is it it's through
[1:06:42] science and the food the hybrids that's
[1:06:44] perverted the whole human body till
[1:06:46] we've become a bunch a mass of
[1:06:48] corruption well if the physical being is
[1:06:51] being corrupted isn't the brain cell in
[1:06:53] that physical being right
[1:06:55] and then in thirsty says but the way
[1:06:57] they are on the street today haircut
[1:07:00] like a man wearing men's clothes and
[1:07:02] then men turn around wearing women's
[1:07:04] clothes and a haircut like a woman see
[1:07:06] it's a perversion the whole thing your
[1:07:08] food is perverted your life is perverted
[1:07:09] your thirst perverted your desire is
[1:07:12] perverted it's a day of perversion
[1:07:15] amen my goodness brother Brandon saying
[1:07:17] this in 1965 how we would love to go
[1:07:20] back and live in a society like 1965 but
[1:07:23] he's speaking to the seed that's been
[1:07:25] planted we're watching the fruit that's
[1:07:27] about to be harvested and sent to the
[1:07:30] fire
[1:07:36] estrogen is everywhere
[1:07:38] used to not be this way now you go out
[1:07:41] into the Farmland all you see is
[1:07:42] practically soy everywhere
[1:07:44] it's in every snack every baby formula
[1:07:47] almost every baby formula vegetable oils
[1:07:50] and every snack it's in meat and dairy
[1:07:52] production it's in tap water bottled
[1:07:54] water BPA and Plastics phthalates and
[1:07:56] lotion makeup laundry Products plastic
[1:07:59] wrap birth control pills are in the
[1:08:00] water supply
[1:08:03] and testosterone is suppressed
[1:08:06] when there's excess estrogen so if if
[1:08:10] that's being consumed what's happening
[1:08:12] to the men
[1:08:14] and then when it's suppressed from Young
[1:08:16] ages the development
[1:08:18] leads to the feminization of boys
[1:08:23] what what hour are we living in look at
[1:08:25] this
[1:08:26] what's being pushed and now even even
[1:08:28] gender treatments to absolutely go and
[1:08:33] suppress
[1:08:34] hormone development and body development
[1:08:37] what a what a corruption
[1:08:40] what a deceit
[1:08:44] so over the past 50 years in studies
[1:08:47] human sperm counts appear to have fallen
[1:08:49] by more than 50 percent around the globe
[1:08:53] it's increased risk of breast cancer
[1:08:54] cervical cancer cause weight gain
[1:08:57] fibroids in the uterus fatigue enlarged
[1:08:59] breasts and Men high blood pressure
[1:09:01] blood clots
[1:09:04] look at your look at your food one
[1:09:06] second and you'll see how much soy is in
[1:09:08] everything Health Products say oh I want
[1:09:10] a nice healthy protein bar don't don't
[1:09:13] look at the wrapper if you want to
[1:09:15] have your bubble burst
[1:09:20] so when we look at all of these things
[1:09:23] that have taken place
[1:09:25] and put it forward we realize that this
[1:09:27] is Satan's design yeah
[1:09:29] this is his purpose
[1:09:32] this is what this is what he wanted to
[1:09:34] accomplish in this day and and it's
[1:09:36] maybe easy for us to see the end results
[1:09:39] but we can't miss the direction
[1:09:42] that he wants to take believers
[1:09:46] Satan has a purpose he has a plan he
[1:09:47] wants to destroy
[1:09:49] he wants to give us the wrong Vision the
[1:09:52] wrong viewpoint
[1:09:55] we've corrupted biblical norms and even
[1:09:58] within our own
[1:10:00] families I
[1:10:02] as a father have to wrestle with this I
[1:10:05] have to look at this and say this is
[1:10:07] this is my authority this is my job
[1:10:10] to do this I don't leave this to the
[1:10:12] school system I don't leave this
[1:10:15] to another another another person it's
[1:10:18] our job as parents as Mom and Dad as a
[1:10:21] dad to make sure
[1:10:23] our children are being prepared
[1:10:26] for life
[1:10:28] well we sent him to school to do that oh
[1:10:30] my goodness I hope you don't
[1:10:35] education
[1:10:36] science civilization it's all of the
[1:10:39] devil so are we sending them to be
[1:10:40] trained by the devil
[1:10:43] Tom I'm I'm not trying to tell you what
[1:10:46] to do I'm trying to preach the word
[1:10:48] and help you understand how to make
[1:10:50] choices I don't care about controlling
[1:10:52] anybody's life I got enough problems to
[1:10:54] figure out on my own
[1:10:57] but I do have to preach the word and
[1:10:59] point you to Christ
[1:11:00] and so when we look at this we have to
[1:11:04] be careful we have to be wise
[1:11:06] and what we're doing
[1:11:09] it's it's your it's your it's our job
[1:11:12] to train our children and prepare them
[1:11:14] to get married to raise families
[1:11:18] to train our sons the right way to train
[1:11:21] our daughters the right way it's our
[1:11:24] duty as fathers we can't say well that's
[1:11:26] my wife's job
[1:11:29] maybe it is but you should be there you
[1:11:32] you have to be involved you have to be
[1:11:35] there number one is we teach our
[1:11:37] children we teach our family the word of
[1:11:39] God
[1:11:40] no preacher no Sunday school can replace
[1:11:43] a father
[1:11:45] that sits down and one-on-one or in a
[1:11:48] small group with their little family
[1:11:50] teaches them
[1:11:52] about the Bible we can't be derelict in
[1:11:55] our duty
[1:11:56] young men that are
[1:11:58] just married or getting ready to get
[1:11:59] married remember that
[1:12:01] that's your duty not your wife's duty to
[1:12:04] lead the family
[1:12:05] it's your duty spiritually physically
[1:12:08] financially all of these things you
[1:12:11] don't abdicate that to somebody else
[1:12:15] the world would have us do all kinds of
[1:12:17] those things
[1:12:20] in our current culture the father's
[1:12:22] authority over his children and
[1:12:23] specifically over his daughters is
[1:12:25] little more than a joke
[1:12:27] to be made about bygone times way and
[1:12:30] back in the day
[1:12:34] it it truly is yeah
[1:12:37] yeah it's a it's a it's a it's a thing
[1:12:38] that they look at and say it's just
[1:12:40] that's just fanatical
[1:12:42] that's crazy
[1:12:44] but the Bible makes it clear that both
[1:12:47] the Sun
[1:12:48] but also a daughter is under her
[1:12:50] father's Authority until that Authority
[1:12:52] is transferred to her husband or the
[1:12:54] father dies
[1:12:56] you know we read these things we we look
[1:12:58] at it in the Bible I hope you read it in
[1:13:00] the Bible
[1:13:01] many people don't aren't doing that
[1:13:03] they listen to this they listen to that
[1:13:05] sermon but they're not studying their
[1:13:07] Bibles
[1:13:09] but the Book of Numbers clearly shows
[1:13:12] what shows us this
[1:13:15] if a woman also this is numbers 33 and 4
[1:13:18] if women also vow a vow unto the Lord
[1:13:20] and bind herself by a bond being in her
[1:13:23] father's house in her Youth and her
[1:13:24] father hear her vow and her bond
[1:13:26] wherewith she hath bound her soul and
[1:13:28] her father shall hold his peace at her
[1:13:29] then all her vows shall stand and every
[1:13:31] Bond wherewith she hath bound her soul
[1:13:33] shall stand
[1:13:35] verse five through seven
[1:13:38] but if her father disallow her in that
[1:13:41] day then he heareth not any of her vows
[1:13:43] or other bonds wherewith she hath bound
[1:13:45] her soul shall stand and the Lord shall
[1:13:47] forgive her because her father disallow
[1:13:49] her and if she had it all and husband
[1:13:51] when she vowed or uttered outright of
[1:13:53] her lit out of her lips where would she
[1:13:55] bound her soul and her husband heard it
[1:13:57] she held his and held his peace at her
[1:14:00] in the day that he heard it then her
[1:14:03] vows shall stand and her bonds wherewith
[1:14:05] she bound her soul shall stand
[1:14:08] he said it has to do with vows it's
[1:14:09] nothing nothing applicable to us but the
[1:14:12] big picture is from the scripture we
[1:14:14] understand the father's Authority
[1:14:19] you know we look at these things and we
[1:14:21] say well
[1:14:22] you know
[1:14:24] getting asking uh it's a polite thing
[1:14:28] to ask the fathers you know young man
[1:14:31] should ask the father's permission to
[1:14:34] speak to his daughter it's a polite
[1:14:35] thing it's not just a polite thing
[1:14:38] it's the way it must be done
[1:14:41] I promise you anyone tries to come and
[1:14:43] talk to my daughters without talking to
[1:14:45] me is going to get a phone call
[1:14:49] and be told to back up
[1:14:51] and it should be the same for every
[1:14:53] father
[1:14:55] it's your duty it's not going to be your
[1:14:57] wife it's not going to be the pastor
[1:14:59] it's not going to be another person that
[1:15:01] enforces what God's word says about it
[1:15:05] it has to be you
[1:15:07] you have to lead your family
[1:15:09] you can't abdicate that to another
[1:15:11] person
[1:15:16] a man's
[1:15:17] children
[1:15:19] are under his authority
[1:15:21] that means they're under his protection
[1:15:23] they're under his guidance they're under
[1:15:25] his provision
[1:15:27] especially a man with daughters you have
[1:15:30] to
[1:15:31] be on the watch you have to be on the
[1:15:33] lookout and if you have if you have sons
[1:15:36] teach your young men teach your sons
[1:15:38] guys don't you ever dare
[1:15:42] try to talk to a girl and go around a
[1:15:43] young man's uh uh the father's back
[1:15:46] shame on you if you do
[1:15:49] this is God's word it's not just well
[1:15:52] it's a cultural thing it's a it's God's
[1:15:54] word
[1:15:56] young man go to that father and speak to
[1:15:58] him directly like a man
[1:16:01] if if you're gonna if you're gonna be
[1:16:03] approaching a girl it means you're a man
[1:16:04] and you're ready to provide for family
[1:16:07] if you're not then sit down and learn
[1:16:10] how to do it
[1:16:15] God bless you I hope you love me still
[1:16:19] but again
[1:16:22] our culture says our children should
[1:16:25] make their own choices
[1:16:27] garbage
[1:16:28] nonsense
[1:16:30] our children have to eventually make
[1:16:33] their own choices but they're in their
[1:16:35] home when they're in my home
[1:16:37] I'm teaching them how to make the right
[1:16:40] choices
[1:16:41] and I'm making sure that the right
[1:16:43] choices are made
[1:16:45] that's my duty but it's not just a
[1:16:48] negative thing oh you're controlling
[1:16:49] they're also my daughters are under my
[1:16:51] protection
[1:16:53] they're under my provision
[1:16:57] they're under my guidance that's not a
[1:17:00] bad thing that's not a manipulative
[1:17:02] thing it shouldn't be
[1:17:03] if if that's how you're leading with
[1:17:06] manipulation shame on you that's that's
[1:17:08] the wrong thing
[1:17:10] we lead with love we lead as a servant
[1:17:13] but we lead with truth
[1:17:32] amen all right
[1:17:33] the next thing I want to speak about is
[1:17:36] again when I first came to the message
[1:17:38] and I read what the church ages book
[1:17:41] sad about brother branham's seven
[1:17:43] visions and one of them was the the
[1:17:45] horrible thing that women got the right
[1:17:48] to vote I'll be I'll be totally honest
[1:17:51] with you I was like what in the world
[1:17:53] are you talking about
[1:17:56] why because we've come so far
[1:17:59] as a society that we think okay how
[1:18:02] could how could anyone say this and why
[1:18:05] would they say that it's very offensive
[1:18:06] to say it well Jason Demars why are you
[1:18:10] saying it right now it's very offensive
[1:18:13] because we've gotten so far out of order
[1:18:15] that we hear a prophet speak and we
[1:18:18] think what in the world is he talking
[1:18:19] about
[1:18:21] must have been a different way of
[1:18:23] thinking or approaching it back way back
[1:18:25] in the day our culture is different now
[1:18:28] yeah it is different now it's it's
[1:18:30] corrupt it's destroyed and this is the
[1:18:33] place think about this Saints 1933 this
[1:18:37] prophetic word comes forth
[1:18:39] of what is spoken speaking about what
[1:18:41] happened
[1:18:42] what was happening and what was going to
[1:18:45] happen in the future
[1:18:46] it's brother Branham over and over again
[1:18:49] says this is a woman's Nation
[1:18:51] it's a woman's world
[1:18:53] the perversion of character
[1:18:56] the perversion of women and he connects
[1:18:58] all of those things together look at
[1:18:59] what we're living in look where we're
[1:19:01] living under
[1:19:03] this it's this is this word is fulfilled
[1:19:07] amen
[1:19:09] the fifth Vision had to do with the
[1:19:11] moral problem of our age centering
[1:19:13] mostly around women
[1:19:15] God showed me that women began to be out
[1:19:17] of their place with the granting of the
[1:19:19] vote listen to that God
[1:19:22] showed me
[1:19:26] it's a word from God this is where women
[1:19:31] got out of their place was when the vote
[1:19:34] was granted to them
[1:19:36] then so the vote is granted then
[1:19:40] they cut off their hair which signify
[1:19:42] that they were no longer under the
[1:19:43] authority of a man but insisted on
[1:19:46] either equal rights or in most cases
[1:19:48] more than equal rights she adopted men's
[1:19:51] clothing and went into a state of
[1:19:52] undress until the last picture I saw was
[1:19:54] a woman naked except for a little fig
[1:19:56] leaf type apron with with this Vision I
[1:19:59] saw the terrible perversion and moral
[1:20:01] plight of the whole world Amen
[1:20:06] can you say Amen
[1:20:08] it's just one of you that said amen
[1:20:12] so now I want to read to you
[1:20:15] something written by believe it or not a
[1:20:17] democratic
[1:20:19] senator from California in 1911.
[1:20:28] so this is JB Sanford chairman of
[1:20:30] democratic caucus
[1:20:32] suffrage is not a right when he says
[1:20:34] suffrage it means
[1:20:35] voting
[1:20:37] suffrage is not a right
[1:20:39] it is a privilege that may or may not be
[1:20:41] granted politics is no place for women
[1:20:44] consequently the privilege should not be
[1:20:46] granted to her
[1:20:48] the mother's influence is needed in the
[1:20:50] home now I want you to read what he says
[1:20:52] I this is incredible
[1:20:55] and I believe this is the heart of the
[1:20:57] matter and that's that this is the place
[1:20:59] where the problem came in
[1:21:01] she can do little good by getting the
[1:21:03] streets and neglecting her children
[1:21:06] let her teach her daughters that modesty
[1:21:08] patience and gentleness are the charms
[1:21:09] of a woman
[1:21:11] letter teach her sons that an honest
[1:21:13] conscience is Every Man's first
[1:21:14] political law
[1:21:16] that no Splendor can rob him nor Force
[1:21:20] justify the surrender of the simplest
[1:21:23] right of a free and independent citizen
[1:21:25] the mothers of this country can say
[1:21:27] shape the Destinies of the nation by
[1:21:30] keeping in their places
[1:21:31] and attending to those duties that God
[1:21:33] Almighty intended for them
[1:21:36] the kindly gentle influence of the
[1:21:38] mother in the home and the dignified
[1:21:40] influence of the teacher in the school
[1:21:42] will far outweigh all the influence of
[1:21:44] all the Manish female politicians on
[1:21:46] Earth
[1:21:48] the courageous chivalrous and manly men
[1:21:50] and the womanly women the real mothers
[1:21:53] and homebuilders of the country are
[1:21:55] opposed to this innovation in American
[1:21:57] political life
[1:21:59] there was a bill the Sanford bill before
[1:22:01] the last legislature which proposed to
[1:22:02] leave the equal suffrage question to
[1:22:04] women to decide first before the men
[1:22:07] should vote on it this bill was defeated
[1:22:09] by the suffragettes because they knew
[1:22:11] that the women would vote down the
[1:22:13] amendment by a vote of ten to one
[1:22:17] the men are able to run the government
[1:22:19] and take care of the women
[1:22:20] do women have to vote in order to
[1:22:22] receive the protection of man
[1:22:24] why men have gone to war endured every
[1:22:27] privation and death itself in defense of
[1:22:29] of women
[1:22:31] to man woman is the dearest creature on
[1:22:33] earth and there's no extreme to which he
[1:22:35] would not go for his mother or sister
[1:22:38] now I want you to understand
[1:22:40] that's not the world we live in anymore
[1:22:42] but as Christians what's being said here
[1:22:44] it reverberates with my soul
[1:22:47] and I believe it should be reverberate
[1:22:50] with every Christian soul
[1:22:54] to man woman is the dearest creature on
[1:22:57] earth
[1:22:58] and there is no extreme to which he
[1:23:00] would not go for his mother or sister
[1:23:03] by keeping woman in her exalted position
[1:23:06] Listen by keeping woman in her exalted
[1:23:09] position man can be induced to do more
[1:23:12] for her than he could by having her mix
[1:23:14] up in Affairs that will cause him to
[1:23:16] lose respect and regard for her
[1:23:20] woman does not have to vote to secure
[1:23:22] her rights man will go to any extreme to
[1:23:25] protect and Elevate her now
[1:23:27] as long as woman is woman and keeps her
[1:23:29] place she will get more protection and
[1:23:32] more consideration than man gets when
[1:23:35] she abdicates her throne she throws down
[1:23:37] the scepter of her power and loses her
[1:23:39] influence
[1:23:41] woman suffrage has been proven a failure
[1:23:43] in states that have tried it it is wrong
[1:23:45] California should profit by the mistakes
[1:23:48] of other states
[1:23:49] not One reform has equal suffrage
[1:23:51] effective uneffected on the contrary
[1:23:54] statistics go to show that in most equal
[1:23:56] suffrage States Colorado particularly
[1:23:59] that divorces have greatly increased
[1:24:01] since the adoption of the equal suffrage
[1:24:03] amendment
[1:24:04] showing that it has been a home
[1:24:06] Destroyer
[1:24:07] crime has also increased due to lack of
[1:24:10] mothers in the home
[1:24:13] woman is woman
[1:24:14] she cannot unsex herself or change her
[1:24:17] sphere let her be content with her lot
[1:24:19] and perform those High duties intended
[1:24:22] for her by by the great creator
[1:24:24] and she will accomplish far more in
[1:24:26] governmental Affairs that she could ever
[1:24:28] accomplish by mixing up in the dirty
[1:24:30] pool of politics keep the home pure and
[1:24:33] all will be well with the Republic
[1:24:35] let not the sanctity of the home be
[1:24:37] invaded by every little politician that
[1:24:39] may be running up and down the highway
[1:24:41] for office let the manly man and the
[1:24:44] womanly women defeat this amendment and
[1:24:46] keep the woman where she belongs in
[1:24:47] order that she may retain the respect of
[1:24:50] all mankind
[1:24:52] my goodness I thought it was so
[1:24:54] wonderful when I read that and so
[1:24:57] prophetic to our times we have lost all
[1:25:01] of this
[1:25:02] in our in our country and in our society
[1:25:05] and it's it's by
[1:25:07] the woman because when the woman gets
[1:25:09] out of her place then the man by Nature
[1:25:11] will get out of his place as well
[1:25:15] and you you look at this and you say my
[1:25:17] goodness that Demars is
[1:25:20] the oldest folk the youngest old Fogie
[1:25:22] I've ever listened to in my life
[1:25:27] this is the word of God Saints
[1:25:31] the truth is the truth whether it feels
[1:25:33] good or not
[1:25:35] and I wanna I wanna reiterate
[1:25:38] that
[1:25:40] true biblical Womanhood
[1:25:43] as the man wrote is an exalted position
[1:25:46] it's not an inferior position it's just
[1:25:50] the place and the position that God has
[1:25:53] designed
[1:25:55] for ladies to be in and it's a glorious
[1:25:58] thing
[1:26:00] how thankful
[1:26:01] those of us that grew up in homes where
[1:26:03] the mother stayed at home how thankful
[1:26:06] and how grateful as the scripture says
[1:26:08] in their the family the husband Rises up
[1:26:11] and calls her blessed
[1:26:14] and and and what uh what a tremendous
[1:26:17] thing I hold my mother in the highest
[1:26:19] honor
[1:26:21] to me to me I think uh
[1:26:24] I was asked
[1:26:26] well can't uh woman be a doctor can't
[1:26:30] she do this or do this and I said well
[1:26:33] it's not a
[1:26:35] question of can
[1:26:37] they do it of course
[1:26:39] they can do it women are
[1:26:41] extremely intelligent very capable in
[1:26:44] many spheres
[1:26:45] the question is should
[1:26:49] to me
[1:26:51] as I see what scripture is teaching us
[1:26:54] and is proclaiming over us is
[1:26:59] it gets real quiet when you start to
[1:27:01] talk about this
[1:27:02] but as we look at the scripture what
[1:27:05] does it tell what does it say that the
[1:27:08] vision for Womanhood should be
[1:27:11] what is our what does our world tell it
[1:27:13] tell us the vision is go to school
[1:27:16] dedicate education get a career
[1:27:21] and live your life right
[1:27:23] but does Scripture say that
[1:27:26] is that what scripture points us to
[1:27:29] is however I was raised however you were
[1:27:33] raised whatever position you are in I'm
[1:27:35] not trying to speak against any person
[1:27:37] right now I'm looking out at people that
[1:27:39] I love
[1:27:40] and that are precious to me I know you
[1:27:42] probably could be thinking oh he he's a
[1:27:44] uh I'm not
[1:27:46] I'm not
[1:27:48] what I'm trying to do is point you to
[1:27:49] the word
[1:27:50] I've made many mistakes as a dad
[1:27:53] but what I'm trying to do is align
[1:27:55] myself up with God's word
[1:27:58] and if I can speak something that helps
[1:28:00] young people or any of us
[1:28:02] to go on the right direction on the
[1:28:04] right path because this is as I said
[1:28:07] over and over again it's a direct attack
[1:28:09] from the enemy
[1:28:11] on God's people
[1:28:13] and things have gotten out of order
[1:28:15] things have gone the wrong direction why
[1:28:19] it's because of a lack of understanding
[1:28:21] I don't speak here as angry you idiot a
[1:28:25] bunch of idiots I speak here with
[1:28:26] compassion
[1:28:28] with love saying let's look at it by the
[1:28:30] word
[1:28:33] maybe you're older and maybe you think
[1:28:34] well I I uh I could have had a career I
[1:28:37] could have done this and look at this
[1:28:39] and look at this situation but instead I
[1:28:42] stayed at home and oh you're reading
[1:28:43] your hands about that Goodness Me
[1:28:48] you did exactly what God called you to
[1:28:51] do
[1:28:52] and don't feel don't feel bad or feel
[1:28:55] something less about it
[1:28:57] as the man said it's an exalted position
[1:29:01] amen true Womanhood is a beautiful
[1:29:04] reflection
[1:29:07] of the bride of Christ
[1:29:09] true manhood is a beautiful reflection
[1:29:11] of Christ
[1:29:14] God wants order in the home I'm going to
[1:29:17] skip ahead I covered this before
[1:29:21] Colossians 3 18-19 wives submit
[1:29:23] yourselves unto your own husbands as it
[1:29:26] is fit in the Lord husbands love your
[1:29:29] wives and be not bitter against them it
[1:29:32] speaks of the bitterness be not bitter
[1:29:34] against them it speaks of harshness or
[1:29:36] in other words your leadership shouldn't
[1:29:38] be dictatorial
[1:29:40] your leadership should be from Love and
[1:29:43] service with the vision of what God has
[1:29:46] for you to be there to be a protector
[1:29:48] and a provider
[1:29:51] and wives would of course when a husband
[1:29:53] is in that order would just rejoice in
[1:29:56] submitting to his leadership
[1:30:01] so
[1:30:02] husbands your obedience to Christ
[1:30:06] is to love your wife and be not bitter
[1:30:09] against her and why wife your obedience
[1:30:13] to the Lord
[1:30:15] is to submit your own selves to your
[1:30:18] husbands
[1:30:19] right
[1:30:21] so
[1:30:23] when we look at this this this is
[1:30:27] not something that you watch on Disney
[1:30:31] this is not something you learn about in
[1:30:34] public school
[1:30:36] this is not the direct this is not the
[1:30:38] vision that the culture gives for women
[1:30:42] for men for families but it is the
[1:30:44] vision that God himself has put forward
[1:30:47] to us
[1:30:50] now we look at Titus Chapter 2
[1:30:54] and there's another scripture we'll look
[1:30:55] at next
[1:30:56] and and we see these things and I I
[1:30:59] believe it's it's absolutely critical
[1:31:02] we can't just leave this off and say
[1:31:04] well that was nice for another day but
[1:31:05] no it's for today
[1:31:08] Titus 2 3-5 the aged women likewise that
[1:31:10] they be in behaviors become with
[1:31:12] Holiness not false accusers not given to
[1:31:14] much wine teacher of good things
[1:31:17] that they may teach the young women to
[1:31:19] be sober to love their husbands to love
[1:31:22] their children to be discreet chaste
[1:31:25] keepers at home good obedient to their
[1:31:28] own husbands that the word of God be not
[1:31:31] blasphemed my
[1:31:34] so
[1:31:36] Paul is writing to Titus
[1:31:39] a pastor
[1:31:40] of a local church and saying let this be
[1:31:43] done in the church let these things be
[1:31:46] taught so what is it this is not just
[1:31:48] well this is a
[1:31:50] that's nice Paul but well we don't
[1:31:52] really need that now
[1:31:53] no this is Paul
[1:31:56] putting forth the apostolic vision
[1:32:00] for the local church four Believers amen
[1:32:03] amen and so
[1:32:04] older women teach the younger women
[1:32:07] to do these things
[1:32:09] to be a housekeeper
[1:32:12] it doesn't say older women
[1:32:14] teach the younger women to go get
[1:32:16] education and have a career
[1:32:19] I'm just pointing out what the scripture
[1:32:21] doesn't say
[1:32:24] what I'm showing you what it does say
[1:32:27] be sober love your husband love your
[1:32:30] children
[1:32:31] be discreet chased
[1:32:33] keepers at home good obedient to their
[1:32:36] own husbands that's God's vision
[1:32:39] for sisters
[1:32:42] do you like it
[1:32:43] doesn't matter if you like it or not
[1:32:45] it's God's word
[1:32:47] if you love God you'll submit your heart
[1:32:49] to the word
[1:32:51] and you'll say Amen to the word first
[1:32:53] Timothy 5 14.
[1:32:55] he says I will therefore now this is
[1:32:57] giving direction to Timothy a pastor of
[1:33:00] a local church the Christ's Vision
[1:33:03] through the Apostle Paul
[1:33:06] to the local church
[1:33:08] Timothy this is what I want you to make
[1:33:10] sure that happens
[1:33:12] make sure that the younger women marry
[1:33:16] their children
[1:33:18] guide the house give none occasion to
[1:33:21] the adversary to speak
[1:33:24] reproachfully
[1:33:26] this is
[1:33:27] the vision
[1:33:28] that one that the that God
[1:33:31] put forth
[1:33:33] to young people young people young
[1:33:35] ladies what is God saying to me what
[1:33:38] should I do what's the vision for my
[1:33:39] life
[1:33:41] get married bear children guide the
[1:33:44] house
[1:33:48] what what did it not say what Vision did
[1:33:50] it not give get a career provide for
[1:33:53] your own self
[1:33:57] you might not like me but that's this
[1:33:59] this is the vision
[1:34:02] that the that the Lord wanted to put
[1:34:04] forward to before his people
[1:34:10] guide the house it means to to rule a
[1:34:12] household manage the family Affairs
[1:34:15] under the authority of her husband
[1:34:17] that's the purpose of the wife as a
[1:34:21] helper
[1:34:24] get married bear children guide the
[1:34:27] house
[1:34:29] that's what you should do
[1:34:33] in America and Europe women have been
[1:34:35] told for the last 70 years that the path
[1:34:36] of life is to go to college get a degree
[1:34:38] and have a career
[1:34:40] and what has it done it's led to the
[1:34:41] destruction of Western society as we
[1:34:44] know it
[1:34:46] that's an absolute fact
[1:34:48] oh that's a separate issue that has
[1:34:49] nothing to do with it brother Branham
[1:34:51] said
[1:34:52] woman began to get out of her place when
[1:34:55] she started to vote it led to immodesty
[1:34:57] and it led to her being the boss seeking
[1:35:00] to be the boss of everything
[1:35:06] the Bible says that the path of life for
[1:35:08] a woman is to get married and raise
[1:35:09] Godly children and be a homemaker that's
[1:35:12] God's Vision should be our vision as
[1:35:14] well
[1:35:15] is it the truth
[1:35:18] anything that we encounter in this world
[1:35:20] anything that's told spoken to us we
[1:35:24] have to filter it through God's word
[1:35:26] that's our every one of our duty is it
[1:35:29] the truth is it biblical
[1:35:32] I don't believe that any of our sisters
[1:35:35] should be ignorant
[1:35:36] a bunch of ignorant ignorama says no
[1:35:38] have no education don't know anything
[1:35:41] but again what is education according to
[1:35:44] the Bible
[1:35:45] see in our society in our culture we
[1:35:47] think okay
[1:35:49] to go to kindergarten and then they have
[1:35:51] to do this and they don't have to do
[1:35:53] anything
[1:35:55] unless it's God's word
[1:35:58] right and the Bible certainly doesn't
[1:36:01] tell you to be an ignorant person
[1:36:04] it tells us to grow in knowledge grow in
[1:36:07] Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord
[1:36:09] Jesus Christ so we look at all our
[1:36:13] society high school and
[1:36:15] University and all of these things is we
[1:36:17] have to do this I know for me when I was
[1:36:19] raised is my sister went to call it
[1:36:22] graduated high school went to college
[1:36:24] four-year College my brother did the
[1:36:26] same well what was I going to do same
[1:36:28] thing just assumed upon me
[1:36:31] now you come to this place you're the
[1:36:33] dad and you're trying to search
[1:36:35] everything out by the Bible what's
[1:36:37] biblical
[1:36:38] what's the scripture say what does God
[1:36:40] want for me to teach and direct my
[1:36:43] children towards
[1:36:46] and again
[1:36:48] the first thing
[1:36:49] what does the bible tell us it says
[1:36:52] it tells us to train up your child in
[1:36:55] the way they should go and when they're
[1:36:57] old they'll not depart from it
[1:37:00] that's
[1:37:01] parents Duty
[1:37:03] it's not another person's Duty we are to
[1:37:07] do that we are to take responsibility
[1:37:08] for that
[1:37:10] and we're to make sure that that is
[1:37:12] what's happening and we as parents we
[1:37:15] give the vision of life
[1:37:18] to our children
[1:37:20] we give the direction of life to our
[1:37:23] children and we should make sure it's
[1:37:24] biblical
[1:37:26] not according to the culture not
[1:37:27] according to what
[1:37:30] this one says Science Education and
[1:37:32] civilization are all of the devil
[1:37:34] brother Branham tells us that so it's
[1:37:37] wise of us to search these things out
[1:37:40] don't just follow the patterns of the
[1:37:41] world
[1:37:44] I'm not suggesting anybody become Amish
[1:37:49] I'm not suggesting any become ignorant
[1:37:53] but in education
[1:37:55] and going to school and going to
[1:37:57] University is not the same thing
[1:38:00] in our world what what do 99 of
[1:38:04] universities do it's a simply a place
[1:38:07] for communist propaganda to be poured
[1:38:10] down their throats and in their minds
[1:38:12] and what are 99 of public schools
[1:38:15] exactly the same thing
[1:38:18] teaching and spreading perversion and
[1:38:21] lies and deception and evolution and all
[1:38:24] these different things
[1:38:28] you say well what are you telling me to
[1:38:30] do brother Jason
[1:38:31] I'm not actually telling you anything of
[1:38:35] what to do I'm just pointing you to the
[1:38:37] word you must search it out for yourself
[1:38:40] and you must know how to lead your
[1:38:43] individual children and your family
[1:38:45] what I'm pointing out is just because
[1:38:48] the the world says it doesn't mean we
[1:38:50] have to swallow it down
[1:38:58] musicians if you'd come
[1:39:06] teach your children the word of the Lord
[1:39:08] and to love to read and to learn how to
[1:39:11] educate themselves
[1:39:15] my mom was probably one of the smartest
[1:39:17] people I've ever met and she was the
[1:39:19] only person in the family that didn't
[1:39:21] have a college degree
[1:39:23] why because she read because she
[1:39:25] educated herself
[1:39:27] fathers teach your sons to work hard
[1:39:31] direct them help them find their bent
[1:39:34] help them find some type of work mothers
[1:39:37] teach your daughters how to keep a home
[1:39:42] as I said before young men learn
[1:39:45] how to work and provide for a family
[1:39:48] that's your job as growing up
[1:39:52] prepare yourself for that
[1:39:58] finish with this in the power of
[1:40:00] transformation
[1:40:02] brother Branham says and don't let the
[1:40:04] devil spray you with education and
[1:40:06] poison and stuff like that you have to
[1:40:09] be modern you have to be this
[1:40:11] amen you don't have to be nothing but
[1:40:14] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:40:17] and if you're born to the word you do
[1:40:21] amen let's stand and pray
