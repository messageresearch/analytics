She has been having strange symptoms and a CAT scan revealed [music] a minor tear in the lining of her corateed artery. She is waiting on the results of an MRI to see if it has caused stroke or brain damage. She praises God [music] that so far everything seems mine, but requests prayer for stress levels, answered questions, [music] quick healing, and a clean MRI and a protection for the breastfeeding baby from the medication she [music] has to take. you know, I don't know how old this mom is.

See, where could I go but to the Lord? Amen. Living below in this old [music] sinful world, hardly [music] a comfort can afford. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Driving alone to face temptation. Sore. [music] Where could I go but to the Lord? See [music] where could I go? Oh, where [music] could I go? Seeking a refuge for my soul. Needing [music] a friend to help me in the air. Where [music] could I go but to the Lord? [music] Well, now neighbors are kind. I love them. [music] Everyone, we get along in sweet [music] accord. But when my soul [music] needs man up from above, see [music] where could I go but to the Lord? Let's put our hands together. Where [music] could I go? See where could [music] I go? Well, I'm seeking a refuge [music] for my soul when I needed [music] a friend. Oh, to help me in the end. See [music] where could I go but to the Lord? Well, [music] life here is grand with friends I love so dear. [music] Comfort I get [music] from God's own word. Yeah. [music] And I pray. Oh [singing] my. [music] Where could I go to [music] the Lord? Oh, [music] where could I go? [music] Where could I go? Will I seek [music] a refuge for my soul when I [music] need a pray? to help me in the everywhere I go but to the Lord. [music] Where could I go but to the Lord? I wonder sometimes how the world survives without God's [music] presence in their life. not just a belief about God, but actually his presence in their life. My mom and I were talking about it one time and she was commenting because, you know, from my perspective, and I'm not 25 anymore, but she's even older than me. Sorry, Sister Mom, but [laughter] but I and so for her, when she looks at what the world used to be and what it is now, she really has quite the perspective. She said, "How how is the world surviving without this wonderful truth?" And I said, "Well, the mom, they're not. That's why suicide and drug addiction and pharmaceuticals are making gazillions of dollars is because they're not coping. And that's why you see the madness on the streets that you see. But I'm glad we have an anchor." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where could I go but to the Lord? Where would I want to go but to the Lord? Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. We're very happy to have you all here in the house of God tonight. I have no idea if Brother Tony's done it yet, but you're going to have to turn around and shake hands with somebody. Amen. Now that I'm standing here, turn around and shake hands with somebody. Tell them God bless you. Happy to have you all in the house of the Lord. It's a super special weekend for us here. We've been uh planning for it for quite some time, counting down the days literally. I actually had it on my heart months and months even before even reaching out to brother Aaron and just [music] uh it just I just kept in my whole heart I said man I would love to get brother Aaron we're trying to figure out how to get that done and so uh this is kind of like when we I think it was last year that we had the Puits here the year before I believe it was last year and so uh kind of almost started a tradition and uh we've got them out here having a little bit of vacation time [music] and I said now bring your preaching shoes cuz you're going to have to work for food, but we're going to get you a nice place to relax out with his family. Sister Elizabeth and the whole family. They're [music] right there. Everybody turn around. Stare at them right here. Amen. McGary family, wave at everybody. Come on. Amen. We're happy to have them here with us today. Jack, did you wave at everybody? You probably Okay, you I figured you would, buddy. Amen. Brother Aaron is a friend for many, many years. And um I tell you his whole family. I've uh I I was trying to think back today how many years it does go back. And of course I knew brother Aaron even when they were living in Texas. He's been in Phoenix now for quite a little spell. And uh [music] so we're happy to have him here. I have 100% confidence in him. So I want you to relax. Let [music] the Lord minister to you. Do you have a need tonight? How many came to church not just because it's a habit or because it's a schedule, but say, "I'm here because I have needs in the word of God." And so, I wrote to brother Aaron today and I said, "I want you to take your complete [music] absolute liberty." Have 100% confidence in his ministry. And I got a lot of friends out there uh at his assembly there in Arizona. And [music] so, uh perhaps some of them are streaming tonight. Happy to have Hope and Jeff and Milo. Milo, God bless you, buddy. Happy to have you here. [laughter] Yeah. Hey, brother Milo, God bless you. Happy to have you. Amen. Happy to have them here. You feeling better, Sister Hope? Uh we [music] were praying the Lord would give you a touch. Amen. The devil tried to attack actually Brother Aaron's family right when they were headed to the airport. And boy, I just said, "That's just like the devil." So, we started praying and they all got on the plane and they're here. So, we're looking forward to tonight, tomorrow, and [music] Sunday. Amen. We're going to keep them around Monday for some more extended fellowship. Amen. We're going to come back around on that song. Where could I go but to the Lord? Want to invite brother Aaron to [music] come. Amen. To the platform. Take his liberty tonight. Oh, where could I go? Oh, where could I go? Seeking [music] a refuge for my soul. [singing] Oh my needing [music] a friend to help me in the end. [music] See where could I go but to the Lord. &gt;&gt; See where [music] could I go? Oh where could I go? [music] seeking a refuge for my soul. Oh, needing [music] a [singing] help me [music] in the air. Oh, where could I go? [singing] [music] Sing it again. Lord, &gt;&gt; amen. Where could I go? [singing] Where [music] could I go? But I go [music] when I seeking a refuge for my soul [music] when I need a friend to help me in the end. [music] Oh, where could I go [music] but to the Lord? [singing] Amen. Amen. It's not often you get to groove a little bit when you come to the pulpit. If so, I liked being [music] in the pocket there a little and worshiping. That felt good. Amen. You all get to have all the fun worshiping and setting the atmosphere while the preacher just sweats it out in the back. So, thanks for letting me be a part of the worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you could turn to Genesis chapter 28, going to be reading verses 16 to 22. Genesis chapter 28, starting with verse 16 to verse 22. It's a great privilege to be here. Very grateful for the opportunity. And uh as brother Jason already expressed, we've been friends for quite a long time. Sister Elizabeth and I celebrated our 20th anniversary this year of marriage. And so, um, he's had reason to like me for at least that long. And, um, stuck it out. And I believe we've just become dear friends. And I feel the same way about, uh, his family. Brother Matthew has been a tremendous encouragement to me through the years. And I feel like he's always fellowshipped up. So, that um, I view him more as a peer and maybe even some ways a mentor. And, uh, just really appreciate his fellowship. Always been encouraged by that. But we love each one of you dearly. Glad to be here. and we just want the word to have the preeminence. Um, so if you just allow us uh just to preach and minister, I know that you'll be blessed in that. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Mark, God bless you. Good to see you. I guess I forgot you were out here, but it's really good to see you. &gt;&gt; You're keeping them. That's That's fine with me. It's fine with me if I don't read into that. No, I'm just kidding. But no, it's good to see you. God bless you. Genesis chapter 28. My title is very unique. uh the way the Lord's dealt with my heart for this weekend. I recognize this is a very unique weekend and my burden is for you locally uh that we could just be family and speak from the word of God to encourage you. So my title is building Bethl, &gt;&gt; building Bethl. And I hope you can make it personal. &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 28 16. And Jacob awoke out of his sleep and he said surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not. And he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place. This is none other but the house of God and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it. And he came and he called the name of that place Bethl. But the name of that city was called lose at the first. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, "If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and raignment to put on, so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God, and this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house. And of all that thou shalt give me, I will surely give the tenth unto thee." Amen. If we could bow our heads and pray together. Gracious heavenly father, thank you so much for this privilege we have to be gathered together in your house and to be fellowshipping one with another. This privilege we had of being able to worship and to exercise our gifts and to yield those gifts as song leader and musicians and even as those that lifted up their voices, we could say that for Friday night, it's been good to be in your presence already. But now Lord, as we turn to your word, we're nothing without this. And this the message which we have received in this hour was sent for the purpose of uh loosing the scriptures, the denominational uh chains that were placed on it and the muddling of truths and the mudding of the waters. Lord, you've you've made it a new book to us and we see it as our absolute this scripture. So now, Lord, we turn our attention to the word for we're nothing without this scripture and this word. and may you make it alive to us by revelation as we commit ourselves to you. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You could be seated. I've mentioned my title already, so we're going to be tracking that as we go forward. I know the setup for this weekend is a little bit different with maybe not a traditional service tomorrow. Uh but we um just trust that we can fellowship in this subject this weekend. In Exodus 25:8 it says, "And let them make me a sanctuary." So this is God that's speaking. He says, "Let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them." He's saying, "Build me a house so I can live amongst you." That's what God desired is he desired to live amongst Israel. The tabernacle in the wilderness then was going to be God's house with Israel as they journeyed. It's called the tabernacle of witness or testimony. Jehovah's tent of testimony is another way that you could take uh take and translate that language or the sacred tent of God and you know the different arrangements of it. How there was an outer court and a holy place and a most holy place. Uh what we call the holy of holies. Uh in the outer court all the Jews were allowed to come there and there was a bronze altar that faced the entrance and then there's a labor that was available. But in that holy place uh the first chamber of a structure within that entire enclosure they call that the court there was the bread table the lampstand but only priests were allowed to enter in there for service and then you had the most holy place that holy of holies and only one person entered there entered once a year that was God's room that was where the presence of God was it was that innermost western room of the tabernacle it contained the ark of the testimony and this was the temple of the tabernacle. Revelations 15:5 it says after that I looked and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened. So the testimony in heaven is that tent but then within that there's the temple of the tabernacle and that was the holy of holies in the tabernacle in the wilderness. So that's the that's the place that God would dwell. Verse 21 and 22 of the same chapter says, "And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark, and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee, and there I will meet with thee." So it's not just outer court or inner court, but it's there in this temple of the tabernacle, the most holy place. I will meet with thee and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat. So there God will commune. That means he'll speak. There's some sort of declaration. I'm going to command. I'm going to give promises. I'm going to warn you, but that's where I'm going to speak. So, it was a sacred meeting place. There I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat. There I will dwell. It is the dwelling place of God. We know according to scripture, this is where God visibly manifested his glory there between the cherubams. And if I could say this just a way of summarizing a lot of scripture and a lot of even oral tradition of the Hebrews, it represented heaven. &gt;&gt; All right? In the structure of the tabernacle, you have the outer court where everyone would be and then you have the inner court where uh the Levites would go and the priest would go. But then the way this most holy place was structured, that veil represented the uh the heavens and it and this veil between what is seen and what is not seen. &gt;&gt; It was sealed off from the view of those outside. So that most holy place represents heaven. &gt;&gt; In Psalms 11:4, and the Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven. The Jews believe that the structure of the tabernacle corresponds to the structure of heaven and earth. So the outer the outer court and the inner court represent earth. But then in behind that veil represented heaven because the Lord's throne is in heaven. He said I will meet you there between these cherubams. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the holy of holies is a shadow and a type of heaven. Heaven is Jesus said that my father which is in heaven. I say well the father was in him &gt;&gt; but there is it's God's throne room. Heaven is where God is manifesting himself in full glory, where he's worshiped endlessly. If there's no God, &gt;&gt; it ain't no heaven. &gt;&gt; I guess if you learn anything tonight, you can say, "Well, that's one thing I can know is if God's not there, it's not heaven." &gt;&gt; And so heaven, brother Bam said, is consisted of the word. &gt;&gt; So God on the mercy seat in the Holy of Holies, there he received worship. And that temple, the tabernacle, that most holy place, I want to use this phrase. It was heaven on earth. The Lord is in his tabernacle. The Lord is uh Lord's throne is in heaven. When he said, "Make me a place, make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among you." That was heaven on earth. &gt;&gt; And so it has it holds great meaning to us. In John 14 23, we see there's a shifting here in terms of God's dwelling place. And Jesus answered and said unto him, "If a man love me, he will keep my words, and my father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him." Saying, "We'll make our dwelling, our stay." This is where we will abide, and we will abide in the heart of man. So what happens now is God's not dwelling behind badger skins, and he's not dwelling in the tabernacle of witness, nor is he behind a veil in a temple, but now he makes his abode in the heart of men. And then your heart becomes a a home for God or this heaven on earth. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; The Old Testament, God's dwelling place was the tabernacle. Then that transition to the temple. In the New Testament, we see that God's home is in his church. &gt;&gt; God's home is in the heart of his individuals. In eternity, we could even look to eternity. In the future home, God is resident in Christ and his bride on earth. But he has a dwelling place in his bride, revealing himself through Christ and his bride on earth. And in every single instance you see in the Old Testament, in the New Testament, even in the future home, it's God making a home on earth or a place where there's heaven in earth. &gt;&gt; You following me? &gt;&gt; I just want to make this very simple point. So I believe that as we often sing and we long uh to to be in that place, we should have this goal of making heaven our home. We speak of the rapture and the chain translation and these things. That's a that's a worthy aim. This world is not my home. I'm just a passing through. And so we got to be forward looking and we have to have a vision to that translation to that future home, but if I could say this, not to be contradictory or put it in a way that's uh different, but there must be another ambition and goal that we must have now if we ever want to make heaven our home. We need to be a home for heaven on earth. &gt;&gt; All right? There has to be an ambition to that if we want to have all that glorious liberty uh of the millennium or a future home then we have to yield to that now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Ephesians 2 19 to 22 it says now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God. This is a a family of God, a something very rich in meeting and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone, in whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord, in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit. This is in God's economy. In his economy, there was a plan not just for one home, but many homes. &gt;&gt; In my father's house, there are many mansions. It speaks of many different homes. So, this is his household, many different dwelling places, many hearts that he wants to inhabit. &gt;&gt; So, God says that we are of his household. The scripture does. We are this building framed together that is built together. In 1 Peter chapter 2:5, "Ye also are lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ." So let me put it this way. We should desire heaven. &gt;&gt; We have to have a desire beyond this life. If if we if there is no afterlife, if there is no resurrection, if there is no eternity, then we of all people are most miserable. And so there must be a desire for heaven or this longing to leave. But there has to be some sort of context uh of God's desire for us. In other words, our longing to leave means nothing unless we understand God's desire for us right now. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just want to get out of this earth. I just want to go in a rapture. I just want to make it to heaven. But we have to understand that God wants a home now. &gt;&gt; Oh, just one day in in glory, one day in heaven, one day in eternity. I'm going to make heaven my home. And God is saying, "Heaven wants a home now. &gt;&gt; You're you're guaranteed and assured of this eternal resting place and in and the future home, but God now wants to have place in us." &gt;&gt; First John 4:19, we love him because he first loved us. So there is a deep calling in us to be there, but we only have a desire to be there because God desires to be here. &gt;&gt; The longing we have for heaven originates from God's desire for our heart. Brother Bannon said, "We're going to life to real eternal life. We're going to heaven, a paradise." So, we know we're going there. That that is to come. I I want to say this. Our desire to go to heaven is exceeded by God's desire for your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our desire to for the rapture, our desire for the change is is is smaller than God's desire for home in us now. Good. &gt;&gt; And Isaiah 66:1, "Thus sayith the Lord, the heaven is my throne and the earth is my foottool." &gt;&gt; Where is the house that ye build unto me? Surely this speaks of God's greatness that the heaven is my throne, the earth is my foottool. It just gives him this appearance as if he exist in all time and space. He cannot be contained. It just speaks to this great uh just how vast God is. But then he says, "Where is the house that you will build me? And where is the place of my rest?" &gt;&gt; It's not said rhetorically. In other words, you can't build me a house. There is no place that I could find rest. But it speaks to God's desire and longing. Yeah. Though I feel all time and space, though that even eternity itself is unending because God cannot be contained. Where where's my home? &gt;&gt; He says, "What house will you build me?" That's that beeth. It's that family of descendants, a household. It comes from the Hebrew word banana which means to build a house. Where is my family? Where's my generation? Means to establish a family. Where is the place of my rest? When this is picked up in the book of Acts in Acts 7:49, it says what house will you build me? That means what descendants? What stock? So, he was looking for a generation. He was looking for a people. And it wasn't just a a a church or religion. It was a home is what he desired. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope that I know I know there's a lot attention we can give to that and I hope you're just recognizing these these little pieces as we try to put them together. Now, if you'll look at script uh Psalms chapter 27:4, I find this chapter to be an extraordinary chapter especially when a prophet is able to identify it as a prophecy for the rapture. And so, there's a lot in this especially we say, "Oh, this is rapture scripture." A and in a time of trouble, he's going to hide me in his the secret of his presence, in the secret of his tabernacle. The verse uh the verse prior to that says, "One thing have I desired of the Lord." Psalm 27:4, "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after." &gt;&gt; So, let's think about this. One thing desired, and that one thing I desire, I will seek after. I I in studying on this subject some time ago, I remember what uh really came to me and crystallized is life is all about simplicity &gt;&gt; and that the more that we can reduce our desires and distill our desire down, that's what life is. Life is about reducing all the noise and removing all the distractions and and bringing reducing our desires down to one. And so this is the wisdom of the scripture. One thing have I desired of the Lord, and it's that which I'll seek after, &gt;&gt; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. &gt;&gt; This is, if I could say this way so I could kind of continue this theme, this is a desire to make a home for heaven. And this that desire that we want to make a home for heaven. I'm wanting to tie these two things together. This desire that we should have to let Christ have preeminence in us now should exceed our desire to leave &gt;&gt; at the very least precede it. &gt;&gt; Our desire to leave is not going to be more genuine and more sincere unless there's a desire to allow Christ have preeminence in us. &gt;&gt; Only by him having greater preeminence in us is there going to be this increased desperation to get out of here. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says, "One thing will I seek after to behold the beauty, the kindness, the pleasantness, the favor, the grace of God. To inquire." That means to seek, to consider. I'm I'm going to reflect upon. It is a place he's looking for. A place to seek him. &gt;&gt; Not just a place to call upon his name. Not just a place to worship him, but a place where he can be found. A place to seek him. So the defining characteristic of the house of the Lord is God's presence. When he says to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, it's not how some people may have a I may a second home. I know we don't know what that means, but a vacation home or we go and we stay in an Airbnb and you're staying in somebody else's house. But uh ideally, they're not there. &gt;&gt; But we don't want to stay in God's Airbnb. We want to be we want to stay in his home. We want to be where he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. They say, "Well, I want to invite you into my house, but I'm not going to be there." I if God if we just wanted to be in the house of the Lord and his presence wasn't there, our follow-up should be, "Well, wherever you are, we want to be there also. &gt;&gt; I don't need the structure. I don't need the framework. I just want your presence." &gt;&gt; And so, he's saying where to dwell in the house of the Lord speaks of God's presence. It speaks of his provision and it speaks the pleasure that we derive from his presence. the provision that comes from that, a place of safety, a place of beauty. In Micah 4:es 1 uh to verse two, it says, "But in the last days, it shall come to pass that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills." And just catch the language as he's describing this. The mountain of the house of the Lord is going to be established in the top of the mountains. And many nations shall come and say, "Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For the law shall go forth to Zion of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem." I read this scripture because the house of the Lord is so clearly being described as being on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when David says, "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after." to the Jews when they longed for this place, when they longed to see his face. When they wanted to see this kingdom established, they did not seek a place in heaven. &gt;&gt; They're not seeking a place in a sixth or seventh dimension where they leave this earth and they shed their flesh. But they were looking for uh they weren't looking for this invisible habitation of God beyond this life. But what they were longing for, what David said when he said, "That will I seek after." He was seeking heaven on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; Wasn't asking to die and go into another dimension. This wasn't a longing uh for the seventh dimension. This was a desire on earth where God could be seen. He could be sought after. Where God was present. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I really this is a real important part. So I'll say this. If you don't catch this part, then I'm just going to keep saying it over and over again to you. At least I the war of attrition. You say, "Fine, brother." And we get it. What David wanted was a place on earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; When David said, "One thing have I desired, that will I seek after," it wasn't a translation, but it was God's presence on earth, &gt;&gt; heaven on earth. &gt;&gt; I like how I could prime you for that response. That that worked out perfectly. So, the house of the Lord is a place where God is king. It's where the shina glory rest. The Bible says here, a place where we're taught his ways. It's a place where we are judged, a place where judgment goes forth, but it's a place of peace, a place of counsel. And if David was seeking this place, if this is something that the Old Testament longed for, and the Old Testament didn't long for a a rapture, they longed for the Messiah, a kingdom be to be established on earth. If this is what the desire was, and even God's desire, then the question would be, is there a place like this on earth today? &gt;&gt; Amen. Is there a place where we can seek him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is there a place where we can inquire when we're needy? Is Is there a place we can go where God's presence is? Now, if you could just take your Bibles and read again here in Genesis chapter 28. I'd like to read uh our text again uh to cover what we what we read in the beginning but now with this kind of foundation I think we could explore this subject a little bit more says and Jacob awoke out of his sleep and he said surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not. So there's a there you can read where he's very troubled. He knows something beyond himself was there. He's afraid and said how dreadful is this place. Not in a fear where h of something horrible but this dread of knowing this unsettling knowing that God was here. And he says this is none other. Notice this declaration. This is none other but the house of God and this is the gate of heaven. &gt;&gt; He says this is the house of God. That's what Bethl is. It's the house of God. Ba. It comes from beth which is house and l which is God. So he says this is none other than the house of God. And this is the gate of heaven. When he says the gate of heaven, he's making he's using uh this this phrasing for us to recognize that to him. He said this is where God dwells. And I'm at this very uh place, this meeting place. &gt;&gt; This is the very spot where heaven meets earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the this is the place where the natural is meeting the supernatural. &gt;&gt; That's where he he felt he was at this this blending of what he knows to be human and he knows to be carnal. He knows to be earthly. But now he gets this sense that this is beyond all that. And I'm at the very gate of heaven. That's what a gate refers to. It refers to an entrance, a meeting place. And the scripture, it's a place of authority. It's a place of judgment. You find many scriptures where this is done in the gate. He says, "This is the gate of heaven." And Jacob rose up early in the morning. He took a stone that he had put up for had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it. I think some some of you have tried to interpret this as meaning that church is a place to sleep. But he he's woke up right there's no the stone is no longer a pillow. It's going to be set upright. So that's your we wake up in the house of God. You know, Brother Bram taught us that you will miss it if you're not wide awake. &gt;&gt; If if you're not fully awake, there's a lot of things that we miss. &gt;&gt; So, it says he poured oil upon the top of it and he called the name of that place Bethl. And he said, "This stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house." So by him uh laying setting a right this stone by erecting a stone and then anointing with oil anointing it with oil. This is a an act of dedicating the place. &gt;&gt; It's a great sign and a type of us when we become the when we begin to be established as God's dwelling place. He fills us with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That new birth. There's that oil of anointing upon us. So here he takes the stone and he anoints it with oil and he's dedicating it. He says, "I'm going to name this place Bethl." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Beth is the gate of heaven." In other words, Bethl is heaven on earth. It's where heaven and earth meet. &gt;&gt; It's a prefigure to the house of the Lord. And in this very instance, when he wakes up AND HE SAYS, "GOD'S HERE." And he wants TO ESTABLISH THIS STONE AND THIS PILLAR AND then anointing. HE SAYS, "RIGHT HERE IN this place is is Bethl. It is the house of God. it it's a type that you can bring forward through every other form of the house of God that appears in scripture. &gt;&gt; It's a picture of God's house in its different forms. &gt;&gt; So I want to at this point then this is going to maybe you might say this will escalate very quickly. But if we're going to look at a house, this is what my my goal is to address this for the remainder of the weekend is that a house refers to your body &gt;&gt; to you individually scripturally. A house is a body, but then it's also a dwelling place. &gt;&gt; So, it's a home or some sort of house containing a family. So, it's it's you as an individual, &gt;&gt; then it's or your family or it also represents a temple &gt;&gt; or church. So as we continue tonight and I'm I'm very careful about the time and so whatever remaining time we take tonight that's intentionally vague we will focus on you uh that this this place consider your body your house or your family and your church as Bethl. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or that it ought to be. &gt;&gt; So when we use the subject building Bethl then God intends and God desires to dwell &gt;&gt; amongst you. He wants to He wants a home on earth to in order for there to be heaven on earth, God has to be resident. We don't we're not just wanting a place that we visit and then leave and and take a stone and anoint it and we just kind of go by and we rub the stone and we say we've done our duty, but God wants to dwell in your heart. So God wants to build us into a bethl. &gt;&gt; And then God's desire in the beginning was not to have a church, but his desire in the beginning was to have a family. And that's why he had man and a woman with the goal to bring forth children in the same image. And so God's desires to dwell AS HE SAID, "WHAT HOUSE WILL YOU BUILD ME? WHAT HOUSEHOLD? &gt;&gt; WHO SHALL DECLARE MY GENERATION?" &gt;&gt; So it's more than just an individual, but it's a family or your house, but then also a church. A church should be a Bethl. So that's why that's what I'm looking at when I say building Bethl. 1 Corinthians chapter 3 16-1 17 we already referred to the scripture earlier where Peter said that you are living stones built up a spiritual house where Paul said you are the household of God so the individual is a house now the household itself is the dwelling place of God he says all the building fitly framed together groweth it's built into the habitation of God through the spirit what is Ephesians 4 uh two saying he's building Bethl &gt;&gt; Amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't know if I have it in my notes for this evening, but that was the very phrase brother Brandham uses in Statue of a Perfect Man, building the dwelling place of God's presence. &gt;&gt; Just some kind of paraphrase it. That's what we are built into. 1 Corinthians chapter 3 16 and 17. Know ye not that ye are the temple of God. &gt;&gt; And that the spirit of God dwelleth in you. that whatever we saw then in prefigure in the Old Testament uh it all foreshadowed. We know it foreshadowed Christ. And so when Christ came, he comes as the fulfillment of the what the temple foreshadowed. And even all the sacrifices and all the shadows and type, Christ comes as the Messiah who is the dwelling place of God. &gt;&gt; And then that that Messiah that is the word made flesh. The father comes to dwell in him. He becomes this dwelling place of God on earth. But as we carry that forward, now he is in his church. &gt;&gt; He makes himself resident in the believers. So now by the Holy Spirit, he says God dwells in you. &gt;&gt; He says, "And if any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now this would seem to be blasphemy to an Orthodox Jew who believed uh you know who believes in the sacrifices of the temple and the layout of the temple and the prefigure in the uh the tabernacle in the wilderness to say now you are the temple of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the same way that we honor honor the temple and and no one's to go behind that veil and we honor the we wash ourselves and we have all these rules and regulations for temple worship. He say now you are the temple of God and you ought not to desecrate that. I don't know if I've mentioned it here before and and I I think I've only been here once since we uh moved from Arizona and once was enough. I'm not I'm not wanting greater frequency of invitations whatsoever at all. I I feel that uh I I feel like I was pushed into this a little bit by God by God. I don't like to travel. But I had preached a ministers meeting one time and it was the subject was and there was two speakers and I was to go first and the subject was uh the five definite identifications of the true church of the living God. &gt;&gt; And so I took that sermon and I just realized that what brother Brandham is teaching is that there is the true church of the living God. And that true church of the living God is this body of Christ that has no geographical constraints or boundaries. That that's the true church of the living God. And so I was like, man, I got just just going to come out, lay out these principles, and the minister that follows me, he was the more veteran minister, and he would preach second. It's the way they had this ordered. And and that way the materials would be out there for the ministers to use for the rest of the day. And but they switched the order. And my my main point was going to be the five identifications of the true church of the living God is that the no one local church is the true church of the living God. Well, this brother got up and preached that his local church was the true church of the living God. Well, maybe not just his, but that if you didn't have these five definite identifications, you were not a true church. And so, he began to talk about the sanctuary and the disrespect for it and the building and the true church. And it was all kind of relegated to that kind of local system where you have a location, you have a physical pastor, and you have all these requirements to have a local assembly. And I basically had to get up and say, not to be disagreeable, right? But there no one local church is the true church of the living God. And because and I and I remember making these points that how much more sometimes we could be so rude and disrespectful uh towards people and very very reverent for the sanctuary &gt;&gt; and be CAREFUL HOW YOU TREAT THE SANCTUARY. BE CARE AND WE HAVE NO REGARD for the true temple of God which is you. &gt;&gt; And when it and if I could just finish my thought on the true church of the living God. The local church can have many different pastors. &gt;&gt; One could pass away, one could be voted out, one could move. And so a local church can have different pastors, but the true church of the living God has one shepherd &gt;&gt; once and for all forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The local church you God could lead you to attend and then you can leave and go attend another church. But once baptized into the true church of the living God, you never leave that one. &gt;&gt; So there's a definite difference from the identification of the true church of the living God and local churches. &gt;&gt; But it's that when Paul says that you are the temple of the HOLY GHOST, THAT IS SOMETHING SPECIAL. &gt;&gt; THAT IS SOMETHING TO BE RESPECTED. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT represents the identity of God's dwelling place. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham writes in the church age book chapter 3, "Man was created for God. Man was to be the temple of God. The place of God's rest, the Holy Spirit was man, the temple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't behind the veil in the Holy of Holies. &gt;&gt; It wasn't even in Christ alone. It was in man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the church age book, he writes that God reserved that place alone, that dwelling for you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You realize this is this is what helps us to understand the original sin. Helps us to understand what Satan's motive was &gt;&gt; in the beginning. He could not dwell in the heart of Adam. &gt;&gt; Could not dwell in the heart of the woman. He had to create a hybrid so he could dwell in it &gt;&gt; because God reserved that place for himself alone. &gt;&gt; So when Christ came born of a virgin, God could step into that &gt;&gt; and sat but Satan couldn't. HE WAS SEALED OUT. SATAN. JESUS WOULD HAVE HAD TO RELINQUISH his authority &gt;&gt; and worship Satan to receive kingdoms in another way. But Satan could not dwell in there because God reserved that place alone for him. &gt;&gt; So it's by the new birth that we become new creatures IN CHRIST JESUS. AND GOD THEN DWELLS IN OUR HEARTS FULFILLING WHAT HIS BURDEN WAS AND his desire was in the beginning. &gt;&gt; So God made man or humanity to be his house. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I preached on a subject just this past Wednesday, Wednesday night. I kind of just stopped in the middle of it and uh and I I'm not going to give you our URL or our YouTube channel so you can uh subscribe and smash that like button and turn on notifications, but it when we preached on that, I I preached a portrait of humanity. A and I think a lot of people are still confused because all the scriptures I used to show the portrait of humanity in Jesus Christ was all his miracles. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But then you can go to the scripture and find that every these things Christ was doing was what Adam was called to do. &gt;&gt; And that brother Bam taught us that Jesus was proving that what man lost in the fall, CHRIST WAS RESTORING. SO IT WAS THIS PERFECT PICTURE OF HUMANITY. NOT AS HUMANITY is now, but as humanity God intended it to BE TO BE HIMSELF ON EARTH. &gt;&gt; And this is WHEN WE GOT GOD MADE HUMANITY TO BE HIS DWELLING PLACE. GOD GOD DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN. HE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE CREATION. HE WANTED TO be and live and exist. &gt;&gt; As it's been said before, GOD DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE A FAMILY. HE WANTED TO BECOME A FAMILY. &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, MAN, we are we must then reflect and be reflective of the temple. And I can say this that we therefore are reflected in it in the shadows and types. In 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 23 it says, "And the very God of peace sanctify you holy. And I pray God your whole spirit and soul in body be preserved blameless under the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; So we know that we are body, spirit, soul. &gt;&gt; That man is a triune being. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that's a three- room house, &gt;&gt; a three compartment service. One is your body, what you do for Christ. The other is your spirit, what you think of Christ. The other is your soul. the faith that you have in Christ. Notice how he's able to break that up and put these different applications on it. So each one has a utility. Each one has a use. Each one forms who you are. He says three room house completely absolutely dedicated to the service of the living God. &gt;&gt; That's what makes us what we are. Without without one of those rooms, you aren't that house. Right? &gt;&gt; Completely absolutelyututely dedicated to the service of the living God. 1 Corinthians 6:19 says, "Know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own." Peter says, "YOU ARE LIVELY STONES BUILT up to a spiritual house." &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; this is what God made you to be. &gt;&gt; This is this is not poetry. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not analogy that if I could just have the mind of God in terms of just adopt moral principles that are Christlike and I can treat human beings as as Jesus taught us that we must treat them. If I could just use the Bible as a an analogy or an allegory of good works and I could do that then somehow through the theqi and and this universal energy I could be a good person. No, God wants to inhabit you. &gt;&gt; God has ordained you and SET YOU ASIDE TO be his dwelling place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you have to you are a three- room house, body, spirit, soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Hebrews chapter 10:5, wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me. This is what we see in Jesus Christ that this Jesus was a born of a a woman and yet not conceived by man. And God said, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell." This is what God was aiming for all along. &gt;&gt; A dwelling place, &gt;&gt; a body thou hast prepared me. God is not desiring the sacrifice of uh physical restraint and abstaining from sin or evil works. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; If that was the case, then uh then we we put the same diligence into being the body of God that vegans do in terms of not eating red meat. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just discipline, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That I I I'm going to restrain. I'm going to limit myself. I'm going to sacrifice this. I'm going to give that. And &gt;&gt; and if that's all our lives become is restraint and then and giving that that's not what God wants. God says, "I want a body." &gt;&gt; He's not wanting us to be disciplined and that we restrain from doing things. Nor is he just wanting the offering of good works. &gt;&gt; I don't smoke and drink and I give to the poor. I don't do this, BUT I DO DO THIS. THAT'S NOT WHAT GOD'S WANTING. We could say that modern Christianity and even just morality anymore is the re refusing to do bad things and the desire to do good things. But he's wanting more than that. He wants a body. &gt;&gt; He wants a dwelling place where he can commune. HE CAN HAVE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP. What does he want? HE WANTS A BETHL in you. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO BE A BETHL. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT THAT'S MY TABERNACLE. THAT'S MY DWELLING PLACE. WHEN THEY TOOK THAT TEMPLE UH WHEN THEY BUILT THE TABERNACLE IN THE WILDERNESS and even when they placed the ark of their testimony IN ITS SOCKETS, BROTHER MAN BEGINS TO DESCRIBE HOW THAT THE PRESENCE OF GOD CAME A AND GOD WAS SO PLEASED BECAUSE GOD FOUND HIS REST. &gt;&gt; And he said when THE HOLY GHOST FELL ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, THAT WAS JUST LIKE THAT TIME WHEN THE ARK OF THE TESTIMONY FOUND ITS PLACE BEHIND THAT VEIL. THAT WHEN GOD'S SPIRIT WAS POURED OUT ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST AND HE FELL INTO THE SOULS OF MAN AND WOMAN THAT THAT WAS GOD FINDING HIS RESTING place &gt;&gt; that God finds rest in you and I &gt;&gt; so our body I'm wanting to emphasize this in these few scriptures that Bethl is a place on earth where God dwells. Bethl is heaven on earth &gt;&gt; and then you are a temple of God where God desires through the new birth to dwell in your soul. The new birth is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. By that you become a sealed son of God into the body of Christ. AND CHRIST IS IN YOU, THE hope of glory. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you. &gt;&gt; He wants a body. He wants a dwelling place. So your body, you as an individual, you are a temple of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But this this Bethl extends beyond just the individual, but also your family. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Your home. I even say your place where you live and your church should also be gates of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What do you become when you become a child of God? You become a book &gt;&gt; read of all men. &gt;&gt; It it it's a point at which heaven begins to make itself known. &gt;&gt; And therefore our not only should we but also our houses and our churches should be gates of heaven. Yeah. And &gt;&gt; we have this duty to consecrate and to set aside not just ourselves but our home and our church as gates of heaven. &gt;&gt; Notice this in the scripture and I'm I'm realizing now uh I I didn't find out till this afternoon that I wasn't preaching tomorrow night in a traditional sense, but we were going to be with sticky fingers for making s'mores and the smell of a campfire, you know, talking to one another. It's going to be just a little bit of different setting. And so I I'm just not sure what's going to happen tomorrow night. Come just for that reason alone. &gt;&gt; Ju just come thinking we have no idea this could go viral. We got to see what's going to happen. &gt;&gt; And so I'm not sure just how much time we're going to have to explore these things, but I I can at least uh use this now for you to begin to think about more deeply about this that you I believe we can accept by scripture that our hearts are to be a place for God. But there is a further desire then that if the individual is a dwelling place of God, God then wants to have preeminence in your home life. And he certainly should be welcome in our churches. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, every church must preach salvation and divine healing &gt;&gt; that that there must be a place where Christ is made available as the the healer and the deliverer and the savior. But in 1 Timothy 3:5, it says, "For if a man know not how to rule his own house, right? &gt;&gt; How shall he take care of the church of God?" &gt;&gt; Paul is immediately drawing a parallel. I say immediately, but what he is doing here in the scripture I chose to use is he's drawing a parallel between what a man's home life is like and the church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; In other words, IF HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW to rule his own family, I &gt;&gt; if he doesn't have exhibit a wisdom and grace uh and and patience and love and he doesn't have certain characteristics at home, &gt;&gt; then then what what kind of person will he be in his in a church if he rules? &gt;&gt; I think it's been said before, watch how a man treats his wife and then you'll know how he treats his church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we know just exactly how they treat their wives. And we're like, oh my goodness, poor church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But then we may not know their personal life. Just see how they treat the church. And you can say, "Oh my goodness, I feel bad for his wife." &gt;&gt; Because there are uh ideologies and images of leadership that are very very carnal &gt;&gt; and they think, man, a man ruling his house, that that's one fit. And so it's more fear and abuse and intimidation a codependency which is just rife uh uh for manipulation and abuse. And so he's not saying that THIS RULE HAS GOT TO be a a a dictator, &gt;&gt; but there is a parallel where how a man governs his home is going to determine whether OR NOT HE'S FIT TO GOVERN a church. &gt;&gt; Because if a MAN CANNOT GOVERN HIS own house, how shall he govern? Paul is saying, AND HE'S ASKING IT RHETORICALLY TO SAY, IF HE CAN'T MANAGE his own personal affairs, he shouldn't be managing the affairs of God's house. Amen. &gt;&gt; So from a from a higher level perspective in terms of office in a church, we must rule our own bodies and our homes if we want any kind of service or role in a church to be right. &gt;&gt; This should apply to all of us. &gt;&gt; I think we should take a personal responsibility for the character of the church. &gt;&gt; That we should we should say, wow, this church is this church only exists to serve individuals and families. And so the beauty of the church, the strength of the church is how strong individuals are and how strong families are. So we don't kind of come here to cosplay as Christians. &gt;&gt; We don't kind of show up and LIKE, WELL NOW, AS LONG AS WE GO TO BETHL AND WE'RE here going to church, then then I could say I BELONG TO SOMETHING BEYOND MYSELF and that what brother Jason preaches that reflects who I am and how they live. It reflects how we live. No, you're the you ARE THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE WHAT MAKES UP ITS CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And some may be asking, "Well, I wonder if Brother Aaron even knows the name of the church." Well, it was intentional. Building Bethl, it was intentional. You didn't change the church when you change the name of the church and you change the outside, right? Like, it's still the same. I went to your website the other day and it was down. You might need to find someone who knows how to do websites or something. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So we must rule our house. We must rule our bodies before we rule our homes. And in a more in this image of the individual and his home, those those elements being there, the testimony and the and the character is what's required to serve in church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So our heart is a home for heaven. And then our house, if our heart is a home for heaven, then home should be a house should be a home for our hearts. &gt;&gt; That's that's a good perspective to approach it. Say, well, we don't want to just have a place where we keep our stuff and we lay our heads, but we want to have a place where we feel at home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's one of the the great reasons why we try to you want to have a the token applied and you make decisions about the atmosphere within your home because it's all for the purpose of making a place where you feel at home. &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember the story brother Badam tells where he married a very rich couple. He did perform the ceremony for them and he said he went to the house and everything was just so ornate and so beautiful and had this beautiful view overlooking the river and I went and looked up the h the not the homes per se but the family that he was referring to as a very wealthy family in that area and he said he had performed their wedding ceremony and as he's walking up to the house he just hears the bickering and the fighting and the things that was going on in their social life but as soon as the door was open it WAS LIKE OH HI REVEREND Brandham and we would look at that and if I could just give you an example today if we just saw that snapshot of their house when they open the DOOR AND SAID, "OH, REVEREND BRANDHAM, THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE'S Instagram is." &gt;&gt; That moment, RIGHT, OF OH, LOOK AT OUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; AND THEY SAY, "WELL, THAT'S THE LIFE. I WANT TO LIVE THAT LIFE. I WANT TO ASPIRE TO HAVE THOSE THINGS. I I I want UH THAT THEY MUST HAVE A REAL happy place." But then he tells the story of a poor couple that he married. And my when he gets into the details of it, we would our by our rules today, we would say that uh no god-fearing man would ever marry that couple because that man's got to have this and they've got to have that. They got all sorts of rules in terms of how marriage should take place today. Uh just saying &gt;&gt; and yet he marries this couple AND WHAT THEY HAD FOR EACH OTHER IS LOVE AND THIS RESPECT. &gt;&gt; He said in the very shadows of that house on the hill, he went to visit this couple living in a rail car. Right. &gt;&gt; And when he sees them, he just hears them talking to one another. Oh, honey, I know we don't have much, but I saw this. I want you to have it. And they were in love. And he, Brother Brandham said, if I ever found a heaven on earth, it was there was heaven on earth. Not not just not just your heart is heaven on earth, but the home could be a heaven on earth. Your heart it ought to be a dwelling place for God. But why would we stop there? God wants your house to be a Bethl. &gt;&gt; He wants your family to be a place where God is welcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we speak of Bethl, when when even the in the naming of this church, Bethl tabernacle, it's not just to represent a place where you come to worship, but it even represents on a high level WHAT YOU OUGHT TO BE, WHAT YOUR FAMILIES OUGHT TO BE, AND WHAT ETERNITY is going to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bethl is a place where we as the church live &gt;&gt; and and and where we as the church, Bethl is a place where we as the individual that make up the church where we live and even this church becomes a place where others can meet him. This church should be a gate of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your home where you live should be a gate of heaven. &gt;&gt; You as an individual should be a gate of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Places where others can meet him. place where his wisdom, his presence can be communicated. In 1 Timothy chapter 3:15, this this connects to again to what he said um in verse 5. If a man can't rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God? But if I tar long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and the ground of truth. I What I've tried to transition to now is we go from you the individual to your personal family or your home. &gt;&gt; But now the church &gt;&gt; because he says how we ought to behave ourselves of the house of God. The individual is filled with the Holy Ghost. If that individual doesn't know how to rule his own house, so there's the other Bethl, how shall he take care of the church of God? And now he says, how we behave in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of truth. He brings together this great image of the mythical body of Jesus Christ, the mystical body of Jesus Christ. He brings it together in the church and the local gathering. Paul, HE'S CALLING THAT THIS GATHERING THAT WE HAVE tonight is a gathering of believers. It is is a house of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's likening our gathering together for worship as a temple, as a dwelling place of God. He calls it the house of God. the sermon. Why? Brother Bam said, 'What makes a person want to drink and run around and act like that? It's because we don't have any God. He says, "Is it because we don't have any God? Is it because there's no joy in the house of the Lord anymore? Is it because the Holy Spirit isn't ready to bless all of us? Is there anything wrong with it? But because we do it, there's a reason we're cursed. The reason God's put this thing upon the church, this cold and dampness, we're going to other places for pleasure instead of coming to the house of the Lord for pleasure. &gt;&gt; The the the world exceeds in attention gra attention grabbing. &gt;&gt; We do we do not have a a really there's been studies on it. It says uh and there was a study long ago which was kind of falsified by Microsoft. Thanks Microsoft. uh they said our attention span is only eight seconds. I think they got the rodeo mixed up with the study, but the point wasn't that man has a attention span of eight seconds, but there's so many other things to distract us &gt;&gt; and that there's so many gimmicks now to try to keep us keep us locked in. And nowadays what they're measuring through the way that they've establish. You're thinking, "Well, I'm glad brother got out of the the the ancient ages as up here in the modern times, the stone age now into the modern times." But it's not what you click on, it's how long you stay. &gt;&gt; There's a timer determining whether or not they've hooked you and how long you're staying &gt;&gt; and how quickly you move on to the next. And if they notice that you be you scroll at a certain pace when you're not interested and you pause when something gets your attention, put another stone in the weight in the algorithm. Feed them more of that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And see how long they look. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then whenever you start scrolling, you got to intensify. You got to change it up. You got to you got to lead them now to the next. And that's how people's vices get worse and worse and worse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says here, there's no joy anymore. He says there's no pleasure. We get our pleasure in these other things instead of coming to the house of the Lord for pleasure. &gt;&gt; You might look at coming to church as a chore that you just have to do. But you should be willing. David said, "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after." I WAS GLAD WHEN THEY SAID UNTO ME, "Let us go into the house of THE LORD." WE'VE LOST THAT JOY. &gt;&gt; We go with, "Wow, without suffering, you're not made perfect." So I'm glad we meet twice a week so I can suffer so I can be made perfect. Now the kind of suffering you need, that's why you have seven days a week is that's how much suffering you need to be made perfect. You should come to the house of God for joy. &gt;&gt; He said the house of the Lord is the joy of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just as God finds strength in you and and wants to have a place in you, HE SAYS THE HOUSE OF THE LORD is the joy of the Lord. THE JOY OF THE LORD IS THE JOY OF HIS PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO COME TO church and worship him and be happy and be satisfied. Give him praise. Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants you to come to church. &gt;&gt; Therefore, what he does want you to do is go to church, not stay home and string. &gt;&gt; If if I ever once really sat down, push played, and obeyed, I'd find myself going to church. He wants you to go to church, worship, be happy, satisfied, giving praise and honor and glory and wisdom and might and power to God. He wants you to do that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, we are TO BE VESSELS OF THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD. AND OUR FAMILIES ARE TO BE A CONSECRATED PLACE WHERE where the Lord has preeminence in our homes. Listen, as soon as Jesus leaves our homes, trouble's on the way. BUT THEN HE ALSO WANTS US TO GO TO church &gt;&gt; and the unchangeable word of God. He said God makes a distinction. God gives a mark on the people. If he believes, these signs shall follow them that believe. The believer, not they that say they believe or not the supposed believer, but the real believer. And he says, "I want to belong to a church that's got them signs and wonders following it. That's where I want to have my fellowship, right under the blood of Jesus Christ. We're angels and powers and the HOLY GHOST AND GOD WORKS BACK and forth through his church, THROUGH HIS PEOPLE, SHOWING SIGNS AND WONDERS. WHY? IT'S THE GREATEST THING I EVER NOTED in my life. It's part of heaven on earth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Part of heaven on earth. you when your soul becomes a dwelling place of God, heaven is deposited in your soul. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But then a home that is rightly aligned that that poor couple. He says, "If I ever found heaven on earth, I found it in that box car that day." &gt;&gt; And then he says, "A church where God the word has its preeminence." And he says, "The Holy Ghost and the power of God's working through." He says, "That's a part of heaven on earth." These are the Bethls. And there's a parallel among these three gates, your body, your house, and the church. I believe that our home life should reflect the hidden life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we have the dwelling place of God in your soul. That's that's invisible. That's the hidden life. But then church exists to promote the health and well-being of your hidden life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It it feeds that hidden life. It exists to promote the the well-being of your body, of the individual, and also your home. And we have to have all three together. They they constitute that three room house. Brother Ram in the sermon knoweth it not begins to look into these things. He says there's three rings, three circles. He says that's you. That's God. The trinity is one. Without a trinity, he's not God. He can't be manifested any other way. And neither can you be manifested without the Trinity person that you are. That's body, spirit, soul. Without either of them, you are not complete. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you could have a good home life and a really good church, but if you don't have the Holy Ghost in your heart, you're not complete. &gt;&gt; YOU COULD HAVE THE HOLY GHOST IN YOUR HEART AND YOU COULD HAVE A REALLY GOOD CHURCH, BUT IF YOUR HOME LIFE'S NOT RIGHT, you're not complete. &gt;&gt; You have to have You could BE A REALLY SOUL-FILLED, SPIRITFILLED CHRISTIAN, HAVE A GOOD HOME LIFE, but you also HAVE TO HAVE A CHURCH LIFE. &gt;&gt; You have to have a BODY THAT YOU'RE A PART OF OR YOU'RE NOT COMPLETE. DO &gt;&gt; YOU REALIZE THAT'S THE LONGING OF MANY PEOPLE WHO DO HAVE TO STREAM IS THEY'RE NOT DOING IT AS a substitute. They're doing it because THEY KNOW GOD DESIRES THEM AND WANTS THEM TO BE A PART OF A FAMILY, PART of a church. &gt;&gt; They want to have a Bethl to go to. &gt;&gt; AND WITHOUT ANY ALL THREE OF THEM, YOU ARE NOT COMPLETE. &gt;&gt; You have to have all three. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The soul, that's the real you. &gt;&gt; The inside of the inside, the inner man, that's the most private. Think of the the the analogy of the three- room house. Then you have the your spirit. The man is a soul and the man is a spirit. He says those three rings, the soul, that's where God dwells in you. And so that's your soul. Then you think of your spirit. And if you think in terms of a house, there's some things that are hidden and more personal, but not quite as personal as what's on the inside of the inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then your body. Everyone sees your body. &gt;&gt; They see your physical image. Well, that's the church. It's visible. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's public. &gt;&gt; Was everyone invited to service tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh man, I was kind of hoping it was by invitation only. That way I wouldn't take it personal. &gt;&gt; Unless you handed out more invitations than what we see here, I could still take it personal. I had somebody tell me one one time that I wasn't their cup of tea. And they're very faithful in our church. Very faithful. I almost said that like Trump. Very faithful. Good people, right? Very faithful people in our church. And but they said, "You're not really uh you're not really my cup of tea. I I I maybe prefer something different." And I just told him, I said, "I know that because if I thought I was everyone's cup of tea, I'd be depressed." &gt;&gt; Like, "Why isn't everybody coming? Why isn't our church bursting at the seams? Where was I?" Oh, that's right. Church is public. That's the outward part. It's the part everyone can come in contact. Everyone's invited here, but not everyone makes it to your home. And then though people may make it to your home, they they don't know the inside of the inside your heart. &gt;&gt; These all these three exist. &gt;&gt; So we have if I could just use this as our our closing moments intentionally vague. We must we must dedicate we must build. We have a duty to build and dedicate these gates. soul, &gt;&gt; spirit, &gt;&gt; body. &gt;&gt; Individual, family, church. We have a duty to dedicate these homes to God. &gt;&gt; If we have time, we may explore it in greater detail that just anybody could have a house, but it takes more than a house to have a home. &gt;&gt; We must be able, we must dedicate soul, individual, family, church as a bethl, a home for heaven. We whether it be your body, your family or your house or your church must be must become they must be gates of heaven. &gt;&gt; It's the point where God has contact with the earth. It's the point at which his his characteristics are made known, his attributes are expressed where others can have access to God. It's a place to see God manifested in me, in my family, in my church. A place where truth CAN BE RECEIVED BY ME in our home, in our church. &gt;&gt; But the gates are also where the en enemy attacks. If the gates are weakened, we can be made vulnerable. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's through the gates that the enemy has access. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Ezekiel 21:15, it says, "I have set the point of the sword against all their gates." all their gates that their heart may faint and their ruins be multiplied. Ah, it is made bright. It is wrapped up for the slaughter. The word that's used in the Hebrew, all their gates, it's used to refer to a city, a palace, and a house. All their gates, your church, &gt;&gt; your family, and you. They're all on Satan's radar because without all of them, you're not complete. So, if he could just compromise the one, he could say, "Game's not over yet." So we have a duty. If the gate then is a place where the enemy wants to draw and point his sword at you, at your family, at the church. If these are places and points of attack, then we have a duty to guard them. &gt;&gt; We have a duty to build these gates up, build our hearts up, build our homes up, build our church up. And in Psalms 147 12 and 13, we'll invite the musicians to come. SAYS, "PRAISE THE LORD, O JERUSALEM. PRAISE THY GOD, O ZION, for he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates. He has blessed thy children within thee. If I could say this, and I can say it about this church, Bethl is a place where heaven is welcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bethl is a place where the word is expressed. Bethl is a place where God manifest himself. So if we're building Bethl, what we desire to have is to be a heavenly place where God dwells. That's what I want for my my my person, my individual self. I want to be a a place where God dwells. That's what I want for my family and my home, my home life. Apply when I say apply the token to the home, it it very specifically refers to this dwelling place where the household lays, where your possessions are. It's the place you return back to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It could be a apartment. It could be a cottage. It could be a basement suite. It could be any any kind of dwelling place. But that place too must be consecrated to God. &gt;&gt; LET US NOT FOOL OURSELVES. WE CAN'T SAY, "WELL, I'VE GOT THE HOLY Ghost in me." And then we return to a place that HAS THINGS ON THE WALLS AND THINGS PLAYED and things we interact in and THINGS WE ENJOY AND say that we we're feeding that Christian experience and that we have a sanctuary AND THAT THE TOKENS APPLIED. GOD WANTS THAT PLACE UH UM SET ASIDE FOR HIM BECAUSE IF THAT'S NOT RIGHT, THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FEEL COMPLETE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SOMETIMES WE IMMEDIATELY GO TO BLAMING UH BLAMING THE CHURCH FOR ALL OUR OUR PROBLEMS. WELL, THAT COULD BE PART OF THE PROBLEM, BUT YOUR SOUL HAS TO BE RIGHT. YOUR HOME LIFE HAS TO BE RIGHT. AND CHURCH NEEDS TO BE RIGHT FOR YOU TO BE COMPLETE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And so, we want our church to be the same place where God dwells. &gt;&gt; Where he's made known where he can we others can meet him. That's what Bethl is. A place where God dwells, is made known, and where others can meet him. In the sermon, God hiding himself in simplicity, then revealed himself in the same brother Brandham makes this beautiful statement at the beginning. He says, I think it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; He's talking about a physical building. He says, it looks beautiful on the outside. So I it's striking and and I remember brother Jason and sister Debbie just sharing with us their visions for the remodels in this church years ago [music] and I could say it's coming to pass the the way that it looks it it it it's beautiful to the eye but brother says we have a duty to make the inside right &gt;&gt; by the grace of God to be so grateful to God that this will just not be a beautiful building that we come to but May everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristic of Jesus Christ in every person that comes in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the church can be a beautiful building, but it does not become a beautiful church until beautiful people come in. And I know some of you are going, "Man, I'm bringing down the average." But that's not what he's referring to. He's talking about character. [music] MAY IT BE A CONSECRATED PLACE TO our Lord. The consecrated people, NO MATTER HOW BEAUTIFUL THE structure is. And he said that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people. He says, I trust it will always be a house of God of beauty. One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to inquire in the temple. AND TO BEHOLD, TO BEHOLD THE BEAUTY of the Lord. &gt;&gt; WE WOULD NOT SEE THE BEAUTY of the Lord unless we see people dwelling together in unity. We do NOT SEE THE BEAUTY OF THE LORD UNLESS WE SEE THE BEAUTY OF HOLINESS. WE DO NOT SEE THE BEAUTY of the Lord TILL WE SEE THE BEAUTY OF PRAISE AND THANKSGIVING. AND WE SEE THE WORD BEING LIFTED up and heaven preeminence. AND WE SEE THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE BEING CHANGED BY THAT. THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; The beauty of the church is the character of the people. The character of the people cannot come unless the word is first. &gt;&gt; Let the word have preeminence in your individual life. HE CAN HAVE MORE PREEMINENCE IN YOUR HOME LIFE. AND THEN THIS CHURCH, THE WORD WILL HAVE PREEMINENCE BECAUSE IT STARTS IN THE INDIVIDUAL that then begins to make up the families. And therefore, I believe with all my heart that we do not exist to make church beautiful, but churches exist to help us get ready. &gt;&gt; What's all the rage these days? I'm going to look at some of the sisters. Get ready with me. RIGHT? THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS, IS A GET READY WITH ME VIDEO. SO, THIS IS WHAT WE GOT TO DO TO GET OUT OF HERE. AND SO, THE CHURCH EXISTS TO GIVE YOU THE RESOURCES AND TO SUPPORT YOU TO BE A PLACE OF HEAVEN ON EARTH SO THAT ONE DAY IT JUST OVERFLOWS into eternity. And we leave here. Amen. &gt;&gt; That let heaven have its preeminence here. THAT AS WE GET READY to leave, as we begin to make ourselves READY FOR A TRANSLATION, WE'RE ALLOWING HEAVEN TO HAVE PREEMINENCE HERE TO THE POINT TO WHERE HEAVEN AND EARTH JUST going to blend together. &gt;&gt; And we're changed in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye and find ourselves for a season in that dimension in the air, one day to come right back here, live out a thousand years. But ultimately, where does the future home set? right here on earth. God's vision all along has never been for us [music] to uh go into the seventh dimension, but that the seventh dimension could have full preeminence and manifestation expression here &gt;&gt; on earth. So I say let it start with you. &gt;&gt; You become the first Bethl. &gt;&gt; Consecrate our homes as Bethl &gt;&gt; and this church will live up to its namesake as we let [music] God have preeminence. could just stand together if you would like just another rededication. Let's just pray together. Maybe just lift your hand before the Lord and say, "Lord, I I want to be a dwelling place. I want your beauty to be seen in me." And we could say the same as it was in the days of Christ that when God was manifesting himself in his full beauty, the world turned their eyes from him because they couldn't see the beauty in him. You realize it takes beauty in you to appreciate beauty externally. &gt;&gt; The reason why you can appreciate the beauty of something because it's in you to that something some attribute is in you. And therefore, we want to see the true beauty of God, not try to be made up to what the church looks like in the world. But I want to have this real beauty of God in my heart. Let's pray. Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, we are a very needy people. If we measure ourselves by the perfect tabernacle and the stature and the measure of a perfect man, we don't feel by certain metrics that we could ever achieve that. But yet, Lord, you said that you gave gifts and that the purpose of those gifts were so that we could come into the unity of the faith. That we could fill up the measure of the perfect man that our character could be molded to your character and that you've invited us to that. What you're doing, Lord, is you're building Bethl. And Lord, I pray that we could become more conscious and aware of this process that we undergo as Christians. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That our soul having been made of Bethl, then we become members of a body of Christ that is then with a mission being commissioned to build Bethl to give our attention to the resources that are necessary to consecrate home life and to give you preeminence. Now Lord, also we have a duty to this church to make the inside right by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; So Lord, I pray tonight is we've had plenty of time to express these things that your Holy Spirit could just come behind it and now begin to deal with our hearts in a more personal way just how you could tailor this that's been very general, Lord, not very specific, but you could begin to tailor it to our individual lives and realize I am a dwelling place of God. My family should be a dwelling place of God. My church is a dwelling place of God. and we could begin to take this duty to all three very much more seriously. Lord, I commit the people to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. In the presence of Jehovah, [singing] God Almighty, [music] oh prince [singing] of peace, Trles [music and singing] vanish. Oh, and [music and singing] hearts are made [music] in [singing] the presence. [music] Oh, of the [music] king. Just make your heart a home now. Oh, [singing] in the presence. [singing and music] Oh, I love you. [music] Praise [music] me. [singing] [music] [music] [music] Oh yes, thank you. [music] &gt;&gt; Let's raise up [music] our hands and sing it one more time with all your heart in the presence. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; In your presence, Lord. &gt;&gt; [singing and music] &gt;&gt; the whole world [music] might [singing] praise [music] on [singing] [music] this Help me [music] the [singing and music] praise. Oh, hallelujah. The king, &gt;&gt; the king. Just keep playing that for me softly, Sister Deb. My my you know I I was quite smitten by that sermon. I was thinking so deeply [music] and trying to take notes that meant a lot to me. I believe it meant [music] a lot to you. You know, isn't it true that whenever we find ourselves, you know, saying, "Man, I need to kind of play some catchup and get caught back up into that spiritual plane that uh, you know, which is the only place a real believer's comfortable." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that true? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Life is just so uncomfortable for a believer. when you when you find yourself at a lower altitude, anything any [music] number of things can do it. But and not even not even bad things, just stuff, just life. And isn't it true, friends, that the first thing you think of is is tighter disciplines, more works, more things I need to do. I need to do this, I need to do that. I'm just so glad that it's it's really not [music] that it's not that complicated. It's just saying, "Lord, I know you can lift my altitude. You can get under [music] my wings and lift me back up. I just need a closer fellowship with the Lord." Isn't that beautiful? Just to think about that, friends. You don't got to you don't got to go say the Bible says we're we're going to not need to say somebody go across the ocean and go bring him to us or somebody go up to heaven and bring him down here so we can say, "No, no. There's coming a day you're not going to do that. Oh my. He's right among you. He's right with you. He's He'd be not far from us at all. The Bible teaches us. Wow. I I just was that was just what the doctor ordered for me. And I believe it is for you. I was looking and thinking about about Brother Brandham and I just kept hearing it over and over in my head. [music] Brother Brenham talking about what causes heaven and earth to embrace and he started talking about that early in his ministry 1956 [music] he starts talking about it and he he comes he's constantly coming to Jesus in the water and the dove is coming and [music] a voice is speaking and you remember brother Aaron was taking us to show us look it it's about it's about God desiring to have a home in you more then you're desiring to have a home with him. &gt;&gt; And I guess I've never thought about David is actually not trying to go somewhere to heaven. He's not that's not a a dream way off in the lofty blue because the very the very next verse, if you read the fifth verse, he says, [music] "For in the time of trouble, &gt;&gt; you're not going to have trouble in heaven." So the whole premise, God, I need you here. I need you right now. &gt;&gt; I need you to live. I need to be able to go into your presence and dwell there. Oh my goodness. And brother Brandham 56 57 he keeps saying it keep it's it's burning his heart. He comes back around in the N64 in the future home and he starts talking about that's where God God and man heaven and earth embraced. He kept saying it. Heaven and earth embraced. Finally he says heaven and earth embraced [music] and kissed. Because that is really what God is desiring is to [music] have that. He desires it more than you desire it. Sometimes we can think, "Oh, I just need the Lord so bad." Can Can you absorb tonight that the Lord desires you even more than you desire that more than you desire to go to heaven and have a home there, he wants your life to be his home here on the earth. That's what Jesus was for him. I [music] was just my my goodness. I think I I think I would like to just set y'all back down and preach a whole sermon based on what I just heard &gt;&gt; in the presence of Jehovah. Have you enjoyed your time in the house of God tonight? I want to sing it again. And I just feel in my heart that you receive what you heard tonight as much as I did. And here's a here's an opportunity now. We're getting ready to you're going to go right back out into that. Listen, it's a cold, dark world. Wouldn't even matter if it was in the middle of the day. It's a cold, dark world. And here's an opportunity, friends, to have all three of those, to have your triunity lined up, to have the Holy Ghost, to have a home, and to have a church. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I don't just want to be with the Holy Ghost and have a nice church, but my home isn't right. &gt;&gt; I don't just want to have a nice home and a nice church, and the Holy Ghost ain't right. How many want to have all three? To say, "LORD, BE THE PERFECTION. LET YOUR LIFE live in every aspect of my [music] life in the presence. Come on Bethl. Come on Bethl. Lift it up. [music] Jehovah. [singing] &gt;&gt; How many want [music] to be a Bethl for the Lord? &gt;&gt; God mighty. [music] Oh Jesus. Prince of peace, [music] peace, trles, [music and singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; the [music] praise. &gt;&gt; Wow. [music] How true. &gt;&gt; That is for my heart. If [music] you'd like prayer, we're going to sing. Oh [music and singing] God Almighty. Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; Praise the King. True. [music] [music] [music] [music] Sing it with all your heart. [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; The praise of [music] the world. [music] God Almighty, [music] Almighty, praise of tr [music] [music] It is the praise [music] with every head bowed now. Master, [music] what a time in your word tonight. How refreshing it was to hear. Lord, it just seemed like to me [music] like a a fountain flowing from the throne of God with no end, no no worries about running it, running it dry. It just seemed to be an endless source, an endless supply. We were certainly tapped in, Lord, [music] to that river of that river of life that flows out from under your throne. Flows down, Lord. It's the image of what the new heavens and the new earth will be. But that's but Lord, that that's what we're coming to. [music] And right now, you desire that kind of imagery. That's Bible imagery. That's what you desire in our life. As the preacher said, it just blends. Lord, I've always wondered I I don't think I'll ever wonder about it again after tonight. Hearing hearing how Brother Brandon would describe it [music] that I'll speed up, they'll slow down. What does that even mean? Lord, I think that's what's happening even [music] right now. Lord, I know it'll bring the saints out of the grave and I know it'll change our body. We're not diminishing that. But Lord, it it's not just a lightning strike event. It's happening right now. I pray, oh God, that my life will begin to speed up because I want to be with you and you want to be with me and we want to be together. And Lord, this is coming [music] from both ends. This is coming from above, down, and from down upward. Oh God, help us tonight to see it that way, to realize it, Lord, that we don't have to cross the ocean or or to bring you here. We don't have to bring you down from heaven. You're right here in our midst tonight. Lord, I pray you give us great refreshing, Lord. This is this is [music] a great time to be in your presence. I'm thanking you, Lord, for answering prayer. May your blessing continue with us this weekend. Lord, tonight would just be a begin to break into that atmospheres in that realm, Lord, where we can just feast upon your word and it can fix us. It can do all all the healing that's needed, all the correction that's needed, all the alignment that's needed. Lord God, let it just be a whole banner weekend for Bethl Tabernacle. I pray we commit it to you. [music] I commit these people, Lord, who who heard the word tonight. I commit it. Commit them into your hands now. Go with us to our homes. Be with us throughout the evening. We'll no doubt long remember some of the words we heard tonight. I want to wake up tomorrow and continue to think on them. Lord, I commit it to you now [music] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Turn around and greet somebody standing near you. Shake their hand and say, "God bless you. Thank you for coming out to the house of God tonight for &gt;&gt; We'll see you tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Got a wonderful day of activity planned. [music] God bless you. &gt;&gt; Who can calm the storms [singing] of life like my Lord? [music] His rest to the weery brings [music] new life to [singing] the hopeless. There's no doubt [music] about it. He's my Lord. [music] He's my Lord. There is no [music] other one who can calm the storms of [music and singing] life like my Lord. Oh, he gives rest to the weery. He brings [music] new life to the hopeless. There's [music] no doubt. about it. He's my Lord. [singing] [music] Oh, he's my Lord.
