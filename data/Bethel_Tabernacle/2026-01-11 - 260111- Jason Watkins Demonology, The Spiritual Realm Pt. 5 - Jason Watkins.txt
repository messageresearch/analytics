I like to have bright, happy people who love the word. Amen. Praise the Lord. I love it. and uh it's worth all your all your life. Amen. Praise God. We've got a number of requests that I'm going to uh go to after we read. But for for reading, let's turn to Mark chapter 12 and we're going to take a reading there. We'll read part of it and then we'll let you be seated and and [snorts] then we'll carry on. But let me find [clears throat] um had a couple of requests that came in to me personally and wanted us to pray over them. Uh Sister Elizabeth Johnson from over in Atlanta way says, "I have a a request." Um it's concerning her her daughter Olivia in her car. She's in at school and she says um I know God is able to do all things. I love I love that. You know, Paul said, "First, I thank my God." I love to see a request start out with a praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. I have another request. I know God is able to do all things exceedingly abundantly above all we can think uh all we can we we can ask for or even think for [clears throat] my daughter Olivia's car which is in need of a full engine replacement at no cost to her through a call back I guess there's some kind of a call back that Kia has offered but you have to qualify uh praying that God let her car meet all the requirements amen to have her engine replaced with no out-ofpocket. I mean, this is ex this is express this is explicit. No out of out of pocket expense. Amen. I've had that happen before. I had a bought a car for Sister Sweetheart one time and the U engine was bad in it and the factory they I just prayed. I've had that happen so many times over vehicles and they literally uh Infiniti in Japan off the assembly line, put it in a crate and sent it and they [laughter] installed it. didn't cost me a dime. Amen. So I know this can happen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Um so it says with no outofpocket expense to her. This is her only source of transportation at Cornell where she's at university there in Ithaca, New York. Uh so this is an urgent request um sister Elizabeth is asking for. So please have the saints agree and lift this request up before the Lord. How many are going to agree? Amen. Brother uh Caleb and brother Uriah um are sick today and so we want to be praying for them. Sister Caitlyn Vel, Sister Luna, both homesick today. Um Sister Rebecca Campbell's asking prayer for her friend, Sister Pam Konite. She's having cervical spinal surgery Tuesday. How many remember all these needs? Brother Brad is heading home today. Um uh he's catching a flight probably about right about now uh headed home and uh he had some very successful meetings. I don't know if we were able to get the video up. Um a good deal, brother Mark. And uh that was I think one of the maybe the last service and you can see well he was out of gas. He was uh I've been there many times. Amen. When you're abroad like that and you're just you've preached multiple days and probably driven more hours than you've preached and uh so we're just uh thankful. I want him to come home and give us a full report. Amen. All right, we'll catch these prayer requests after we read our our script, our text. Mark 12 and uh let's begin at verse 28. And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, where Jesus had kind of put the Pharisees to silence. He had answered them well, asked him, "Which is the first commandment of all?" And Jesus answered him, "The first of all the commandments is here. O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength. This is the first commandment." Let's [clears throat] pray. Father, we thank you for your word that has been read here this morning. Father, there's much on my heart to say this morning and more than can be said. And so I've tried very carefully to put together, Lord, what I believe we can effectively say today. And for the remainder, we will put it to a different installment. But Lord, that's always subject to change. Even Even live even live in the pull pit. I'm always ready to hear you, Lord, in a moment. Take me in any direction that you choose. I'm just your servant. I'm just your assistant. That's it. That's all I am. You're the preacher today, Lord. I They They sing. They invite a minister to come. All I've did is walk out here with you, Lord, just to stand here and assist you to feed your people. Now, pass me not, oh gentle Savior. While on others thou art calling, do not pass me by, Lord. So I pray today that you will help us be our helper, Lord. Start to finish. Commit my heart and mind to you now. Lord, in spite of all the enemy can try to do, the word is victorious. And I'm grateful for that today. Now we commit this audience, visible and invisible. And Lord, we have a number of prayer requests. You heard them read out the Lord for our sister Olivia there in school with a card needing this thing to happen, Lord. And we're we're taught to ask big things. So, we're just going to ask big. May it be so, Lord, that whoever will make that decision will be favorable toward our sister, Lord, and at no expense to her, may this be granted to her. Father, we pray for our sick and afflicted brother Caleb, brother Uriah, Sister Caitlyn, Sister Luna, Lord, Sister Pam Kronhite facing this uh procedure. Master, be merciful. I pray your great hand of mercy be upon them today. We're continuing to pray for others, Lord, with continuing the enemy continuing to battle. I think of Sister Deborah Lowry. Lord, the enemy just battling her so hard with her lower back. And I'm asking for your mercy today for our sister. Lord, be with your servant, Brother Brad, as he comes home. Come bring him back to us safely, Lord. Uh revive him and give him strength now, Lord. May for weeks and and days and weeks and months to come, may the word that went forth to those young people, Lord, may it just reverberate through the canyons of their soul, Lord. May it give them strength, oh God, to face the enemy in [clears throat] the place where you have placed them, Lord. May it be so. Now, help us today, Lord, as we fight the same battles. And we're asking for your help now. Instruct us in your word. We commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. Yes, sir. Okay. Sorry, I just now saw that. Um, yeah, I knew about Sister Meredith. I didn't know [clears throat] if she would make it today or not. Homesick, just that time of year. uh the enemy battling, but I was uh Sister Caitlyn sent me that request this morning and and [clears throat] you know, it's just that time of year. But any time of the year, the devil still ain't nobody. &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't matter what time of the year it is, he he don't make decisions on uh about us. All decisions about my life are between me and my father. Amen. He will make those decisions for my life. Amen. brother um Travis, Sister Deb, Brother Donald, Sister Lane in route to Greenville for um a family member. There's a funeral there and they're asking for traveling mercies. May the Lord grant that to them today. Amen. Now, I want to continue reading uh if we'll come back to our scripture on the overhead. And if you have your Bibles, want to carry on reading from verse 31. And I will um just begin and I'll read verse 30 again, please, brother Mark. And thou shalt, because this is the first commandment. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart. I want you to know notice how explicit this is. This is separating into into important categories. It's not just go forth and love God. It's more specific than that. I I remember um recently I I almost started to hunt for it. I could have found it and or created my own even and put it up on the screen. Somebody did it using an LLM, I'm sure. And it it had two pathways. One was a lower. It was very broad. Speaking of the scripture, broad is the way uh that leadth to destruction. And there were millions of people walking in it. And they were walking under a banner. You're driving down an interstate. You'll run under a sign that says, you know, diversion or traffic ahead or whatever, slow down or whatever. And the sign flashing over this throng of people said, "We believe in God." And then there was a higher road that was narrow and there was only a few travelers and the banner said, "We obey God." &gt;&gt; And there's a big difference between believing in God and obeying God. &gt;&gt; So it's [clears throat] not just, you know, that you say, "I love God." People say, you know, I I love I I love Jesus. To which I'm always asking them to clarify that, you know, qualify what you just said. You love Jesus. Now, there's there's there's there there's many people in the world with the name Jesus. &gt;&gt; And it's pronounced differently in various languages. But, you know, Brother Brandham said there's only one Lord, Jesus Christ. So, is he your Lord? Because if he's your Lord, then he's Lord of everything. See, and so they say, "Well, I yes, I love the Lord Jesus Christ." You know, the one in the Bible, yes, the one in the Bible. Well, in the Bible, there was two two Jesuses. There was an original one, and there was another one that's man-made. Now, tell me which one you which one you really love. Well, how do I know the difference? Well, one is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and will never change his mind about his word. The other changes all kinds of things about his word and limits its faith in God. And that is a man-made a man-made system of organized religion. I I love the Jesus of this book. &gt;&gt; I I love his life. I love his holiness. I love his cleanness. I love his purity. I love everything about it. And I love it so much that it causes me to disdain the filth and muck and sin and mire of the world. I'm trying to rescue all the people I can out of it. But I have no love for this world. AND I'M GLAD I DON'T BECAUSE JESUS WARNED THAT IF YOU LOVE THIS world and the things of the world of the world, then it's an obvious sign the love of God, the new birth is not in you. WELL, HOW, BROTHER JASON, HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU have the Holy Ghost? Did you shake? Did you tremble? Did you run? Did you shout? Did you speak in tongues? Listen, BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT uh Apollos and those that were following him. And brother and brother Brandham SAYS THEY WERE HAVING GREAT REVIVAL MEETINGS AND SHOUTING AND THEY WEREN'T EVEN BORN AGAIN. THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE HOLY GHOST AT THAT TIME. AND YET THEY'RE SHOUTING AND REJOICING AND PREACHING. SEE? And so AND SO WHEN PAUL SAID, "WELL, HAVE YOU RECEIVED THE Holy Ghost SINCE YOU BELIEVED?" WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? HOW WERE YOU BAPTIZED UNTO JOHN? WELL, OKAY, that explains it. You've got to move on. You've got to not just have a belief in him somewhere in the misty blue or historical way BACK YEARS AGO, BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE A FELLOWSHIP BECAUSE HE'S a mystery. And the Bible says that this mystery, IT'S NOT A DOCTRINE. THIS MYSTERY WANTS TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's a person &gt;&gt; of the word. And so, WE SAY, "HOW DO YOU KNOW?" BECAUSE SAY, "DID YOU DO THIS? Did you do that? Did you have this sign? YOU OF THAT SIGN HERE. HERE'S WHAT I CAN SAY TO YOU FRIENDS. AT ANY TIME OVER THE MANY YEARS OF MY LIFE SERVING THE LORD, I'VE HAD ALL KINDS OF THOSE EXPERIENCES. BUT HERE'S HOW I KNOW THAT I HAVE PASSED FROM DEATH TO LIFE. I HAVE NO MORE LOVE for this world or the things of this world. I love him. I LOVE HOLINESS. I LOVE RIGHTEOUSNESS. I LOVE THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; No matter what it says to me, &gt;&gt; what it challenges me &gt;&gt; what it tells me to get rid of, lay aside. I just say, LORD, YOU SAY, "WELL, YEAH, I I I FEEL THAT WAY, BROTHER JASON, BUT SOMETIMES I STRUGGLE." SOMETIMES SO DO I. SO, I SAY, "LORD, I BELIEVE. HELP THOU MY UNBELIEF." HOW MANY WANT HIM TO HELP YOUR AREAS OF UNBELIEF TODAY? HE WILL. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT'S WHAT PREACHING DOES. IT HELPS YOU. It strengthens you. &gt;&gt; SO HE COMES TO THIS FIRST COMMANDMENT. VERSE 30. THOU SHALT LOVE the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind. NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GREATEST battle ever fought. This is demonology in the spiritual realm, in the realm of your spirit, where your mind is. And so, this is where the enemy, this is, remember that here, here's a good point. I'm getting ahead of myself in my notes, but I just feel led to say it now that when when the serpent BEING POSSESSED BY Satan came to Eve, he did not come, isn't it? This is important. HE DID NOT COME WITH VIOLENCE. &gt;&gt; He came with a question. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HE DIDN'T ATTACK HER? HE DIDN'T THROW HER DOWN AND RAVISH HER. HE CAME WITH A question from the Bible. &gt;&gt; Hath God said such and such and such and such? And Eve made her first mistake. She stopped to listen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's our first mistake. You say, "Oh, I'm I'm going to I'm going to PROVE TO THE DEVIL." DON'T PROVE NOTHING TO HIM. YOU GOT NOTHING TO PROVE TO HIM. I I'm GOING TO JUST TELL HIM WHAT I DON'T TELL HIM ANYTHING. DON'T THINK ABOUT HIM. UH JUST CONFESS. SAY, "GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN ME THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD." JESUS didn't argue WITH SATAN. JESUS DIDN'T PLAY THE MIND GAMES. SATAN TRIED, IF YOU NOTICE, SATAN TRIED TO COME TO JESUS in the wilderness IN THE SAME WAY HE came to Eve. If thou be the son of God, &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't argue with him. He didn't he didn't he didn't engage him. He just quoted him the word and moved on. And Satan came at him again. You know, the Bible says this, "Well, how about you do this?" Jesus didn't argue with him. He just simply quoted him the word and moved on. AND WHEN SATAN FINALLY COME ALL THIS WILL I GIVE YOU. Jesus doesn't argue. Brother Brandham SAID SATAN IT SATAN WAS HE HE CONTROLLED IT ALL. HE SAYS BUT JESUS STANDING there knew it. He saw all THE KINGDOMS. &gt;&gt; JESUS STANDING THERE SAW YOU AND I IN THE AGE THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. AND SATAN SAID, "I'LL GIVE IT ALL TO YOU IF YOU WORSHIP ME." BUT JESUS KNEW THAT HE WOULD ALREADY GET YOU BECAUSE YOU WOULD LOVE HIM AND YOU WOULD BELIEVE HIM NO MATTER WHAT THE AGE HAPPENED. NO MATTER HOW DARK IT GOT, THERE WOULD BE A PEOPLE WHO WOULD SAY, "I LOVE [screaming] THE LORD." &gt;&gt; GOD, &gt;&gt; AND I DO NOT LOVE THIS WORLD. AND I LOATHE ANY WEAKNESS OR FAILURE OR SLIPPAGE IN MY LIFE. I DON'T WAKE I WAKE UP EVERY MORNING DETERMINED TO GO TO BED THAT NIGHT WITH A CLEAN RECORD, WITH A PERFECT PERFECT WALK BEFORE THE LORD. DO YOU ALWAYS SUCCEED? I DO NOT. BUT I GO TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT THANKING HIM FOR LIFE. I AND REPENTING AND WAKING UP THANKING HIM AND CLEANSING MY HEART AND SAYING, "LORD, NOW HOW CAN I SERVE YOU TODAY?" &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THOU SHALT LOVE THE LORD. I'M JUST HANGING ON THIS VERSE BECAUSE IT'S so important. [sighs] We're speaking about the battle of the mind. And I don't I don't understand the argument. I don't get the argument. IT'S REALLY NOT AN ARGUMENT. &gt;&gt; YEAH. I DON'T YOU KNOW THERE THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMEHOW IN SPITE OF ALL OF THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF QUOTES FROM BROTHER BRANDHAM DEALING WITH THE BATTLES OF THE MIND &gt;&gt; THAT SOMEHOW WHEN A YOU START TO PREACH ALONG THOSE THINGS EVEN READING THE QUOTES YOU GET ACCUSED OF CHRISTIAN PSYCHOLOGY &gt;&gt; WAIT WHAT I'M JUST READING WHAT A PROPHET SAID I'M JUST READING BIBLE VERSES WHAT ABOUT WHAT PAUL SAID ABOUT HOW WE DAILY NUTS AND BOLTS HOW WE DAILY OVERCOME HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, YOU JUST NEED TO BE BORN AGAIN OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD." NO KIDDING. &gt;&gt; YOU THINK, &gt;&gt; OF COURSE, THIS LISTEN, WE'RE IN THE FIFTH INSTALLMENT TODAY. BY THIS TIME, I'M WAY DOWNSTREAM ASSUMING THAT I'M TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE PASSED FROM DEATH TO LIFE &gt;&gt; BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. PAUL WAS WRITING AND SPEAKING TO PEOPLE BORN AGAIN OF THE SPIRIT SAYING, "STAND FIRM. &gt;&gt; PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD. CAST DOWN VAIN IMAGINATIONS." WHY WOULD HE HAVE TO SAY THAT IF ALL IF ALL YOU HAD TO DO IS GET BORN AGAIN AND YOU DON'T NEED TO DO NOTHING ELSE? THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL CHRISTIANITY. BECAUSE THE DEVIL IS NOT GOING TO LEAVE YOU ALONE JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE BORN AGAIN. IN FACT, IS you become a target. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, I DON'T GET THAT THAT THAT WHOLE I DON'T EVEN GET IT. I don't even want to I didn't want to go down because it it it's maddening to me how that anybody could even let that be a discussion. So, I don't want to stand here and discuss it and defend ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER. I'M JUST GLAD THAT IT MY BIBLE IS FULL OF WAYS TO HELP ME be victorious. &gt;&gt; And and AND IT TELLS ME HOW TO GET BORN AGAIN. AND I DID AND IT WORKED AND I AM &gt;&gt; AND IT TELLS ME HOW TO DEFEAT HIM. AND I DO AND IT WORKS AND HERE I STAND. AMEN. SEE, &gt;&gt; so that's why I WAS SAYING TO YOU LAST TIME, WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT, THE NEW BIRTH OR PRACTICAL STEPS TO DAILY TRANSFORMATION AND STRENGTHENING in in IN THE FAITH? WELL, THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH. AND I MEAN, WHICH ONE WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU? CHRIST PURCHASING WORK AT CALVARY OR HIS REDEEMING WORK UH OPENING THE SEVEN SEALS? HIS CLAIMING WORK OPENING THE SEVEN SEALS. IF IF THIS ONE HAPPENS AND THIS ONE DOESN'T, THIS ONE IS FOR NOT. IF THIS ONE DOESN'T HAPPEN, THIS ONE WILL NEVER HAPPEN. SO, YOU TELL ME WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT. YOU TELL ME WHICH IS WHY I I KNOW THAT I MUST PASS FROM DEATH TO LIFE. I KNOW THAT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S NOT YOU'RE BORN AGAIN NOW. GO DOWN ON THE DOCK AND WAIT ON THE OLD SHIP OF ZION AND SIT ON YOUR LUGGAGE. OR YOU'RE BORN AGAIN NOW. I'LL SEE YOU IN HEAVEN. I'M I'VE GOT TO FIGHT IF I MUST WIN. WE'RE AN ARMY. THIS IS WAR. AND I DON'T PLAN TO LOSE IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I don't want to see you lose. &gt;&gt; I don't want to see your children lose. I DON'T WANT TO SEE OUR TEENAGERS DRUGGED THROUGH THE drug through the muck and mire of the world TO GET WOUNDED, SCARRED, FILTH UP, AND THEN FINALLY THE LORD BRING THEM TO THEIR SENSES AND THEY COME BACK AND REPENT AND THEN THEY'RE FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST. I'D RATHER SEE THEM NOT HAVE TO GO DOWN THAT PATH. &gt;&gt; I'D RATHER SEE THEM FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY PATH TO ETERNAL LIFE. THERE'S NO OTHER PATH. &gt;&gt; Either you're born again OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD OR YOU'RE not only THOSE BORN ONLY BECAUSE ONLY THE PART OF YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE FIRST RESURRECTION AND THE ONLY WAY TO BE IN PART OF THE FIRST RESURRECTION IS TO BE BORN AGAIN of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; See, because then it's not your life, it's Jesus life. Since he has already raised from the dead, then then that that SAME SPIRIT THAT QUICKENED HIS, IF IT DWELL IN YOU, WILL ALSO QUICKEN YOUR MORTAL body &gt;&gt; because you're PART OF THAT FIRST RESURRECTION. Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; I got to get off this verse. &gt;&gt; But I promised the Lord I would go as I feel led. &gt;&gt; Amen. So [snorts] thou shalt love the Lord thy God WITH ALL THY HEART, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, AND WITH ALL THY STRENGTH. THIS is the FIRST COMMANDMENT. VERSE 31. AND THE SECOND IS LIKE, NAMELY THIS, THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF. There is none other comm none other commandment greater than these. AND THE SCRIBES SAID UNTO HIM, "WELL, MASTER, thou hast said the truth, for there is one God, and there is none other but he." And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all THE STRENGTH. SEE, SO you're So now he's replacing mind WITH UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE THEY'RE THE same thing. YOUR YOUR SPIRIT IS WHERE YOUR MEMORY, CONSCIENCE, REASON, AFFECTION, and imagination are. &gt;&gt; You understand? As a man thinkketh in his heart, so is he. &gt;&gt; So you you understand? So So it's your it's your UNDERSTANDING OF WHO HE IS, WHAT THIS IS, WHO YOU ARE, HOW YOU BECOME PART OF THIS. &gt;&gt; SEE, and and THEN WHEN THE WORD COMES INTO YOUR LIFE AND YOU YOU SAY, "WELL, I LOVE GOD." BUT DO YOU LOVE ALL OF THE UNDERSTANDING? &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE UNDERSTANDING THE WORD, IT DOESN'T TAKE YOU VERY LONG TO FIGURE OUT. YOU CAN'T KEEP GOING ACTING LIKE THE WORLD CLAIMING TO BE A CHRISTIAN &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU'RE DENYING THE UNDERSTANDING. YOU'RE LOVING A HISTORICAL FIGURE, BUT YOU'RE DENYING THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORD THAT WHEN YOU'VE PASSED FROM DEATH TO LIFE, YOU BECOME A NEW CREATION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, YOU'RE NOT AGREEING WITH THE WORD EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE LOVING THE HISTORICAL FIGURE. &gt;&gt; SEE, does that make sense? [clears throat] VERSE 33. AND TO LOVE HIM WITH all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength. So with ALL THE STRENGTH IS ALL OF YOUR MOTIVES, YOUR OBJECTIVES, your goals, your plans, your dreams, everything that you are, everything you ever want to be, your life, your career, YOUR YOUR MARRIAGE, YOUR EDUCATION, YOUR BUSINESS, YOUR FORTUNE, WHATEVER IT IS, ALL OF YOUR STRENGTH IS COMMITTED TO SERVING GOD WITHIN THOSE THINGS BECAUSE YOU CAN CERTAINLY SERVE GOD AND BE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS PERSON. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SERVE GOD AND AND GO TO UNIVERSITY. YOU CAN AND YOU CAN REMAIN A CHRISTIAN. SEE, AND AND SO IT'S WITH WITH EVERYTHING WITH EVERYTHING THAT I'M DOING IN LIFE. I'm loving HIM WITH ALL MY HEART, WITH ALL MY MIND, my understanding, WITH ALL MY SOUL, AND WITH ALL MY STRENGTH, AND TO LOVE HIS NEIGHBOR AS HIMSELF IS MORE THAN LISTEN, THIS IS MORE THAN ALL WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND SACRIFICES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. God would rather you never participate IN HELPING BUILD A CHURCH, AN ORPHANAGE, or a hospital, but that you'll SERVE HIM HUMBLY ALL YOUR LIFE RATHER THAN HAVE YOU BUILD A HUNDRED CHURCHES, HOSPITALS, AND ORPHANAGES AND NEVER REALLY GIVE HIM YOUR whole heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those commandments ARE MORE THAN ANYTHING YOU CAN EVER ACCUMULATE and say, "I'VE DONE FOR GOD THIS AND I'VE done for God that and I did this and I GAVE THIS." MORE THAN ALL OF THOSE SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS, HE WANTS YOUR WHOLE HEART, YOUR WHOLE SOUL, YOUR WHOLE MIND, YOUR WHOLE UNDERSTANDING, YOUR WHOLE STRENGTH. HE WANTS EVERYTHING UNDER HIS CONTROL. &gt;&gt; That's why he placed you here. And when Jesus verse 34 saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, "Thou art not far from the kingdom of God." And no man after that d ask him many questions. Now I want to look at Acts chapter 4 [clears throat] verse 23-31. This is the disciples having been released from jail. They got arrested for preaching the gospel and they threatened them and and and harassed them and threw them in in jail and then they they let him go and uh they even uh I believe that this is a part where they actually received some wounds and he in verse 23 and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priest and elders had said unto them. So they didn't they didn't go home. They didn't go to the hospital. They went straight to church. And when they when they when they heard that, see, they lifted up their voices to God with one accord and said, Lord, thou art God, which hath made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is, who by the mouth of thy servant David has said. Now this is the second psalm &gt;&gt; and when you go read the second psalm it doesn't say who wrote it but the disciples say it was David. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So David in writing the second psalm is who what it's referring to. Who by THE MOUTH OF THY SERVANT David has said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things? The kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ. that the Lord and his Christ is the Lord and his bride, the Lord and his family, the Lord and his people, the Lord and his kingdom. &gt;&gt; It's Jesus and his kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. The kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms of our Lord and his family, &gt;&gt; his bride, HIS PEOPLE, HIS NATION, HIS KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [snorts] forever truth against thy holy child Jesus whom thou hast anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done. That's important because in everything that happens, just remember this. Everything that happens, even Satan's attacks on you, is never outside of God's sovereignty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is in control. &gt;&gt; You understand? And if you if the devil attacks you and you stumble and then you REPENT AND YOU GET BACK UP AND GO AGAIN, THAT WAS IN GOD'S SOVEREIGNTY. &gt;&gt; NOW, EXPLAIN IT DEEPER, BROTHER JASON. IT'S GOD'S SOVEREIGNTY. THERE'S NOTHING MORE I CAN SAY TO YOU. I JUST KNOW THIS. THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE OF THE SONS OF THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE RIGHTEOUS ARE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? SO THEY'RE ORDERED OF THE LORD. I MEAN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE RIGHTEOUS ARE ORDERED OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; SONS ARE LED BY THE SPIRIT. THIS IS IT IS ON UPON THAT BASIS ALONE AND NO OTHER SCRIPTURE THAT I CAN EVER FIND WHERE BROTHER BRANDHAM qualifies that uh that that UH JONAH DID NOT THAT THAT JONAH NEVER DISOBEYED GOD. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WOW. I was like okay [laughter] well okay why DO YOU THINK HE DISOBEYED GOD? WELL, I CAN READ GOD TOLD HIM TO GO THIS way and he went this way and THE LORD BUT HE BUT BUT BUT IT ALL WAS THE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD CUZ THEN GOD WENT AND GOT HIM AND THEN HE CAUGHT A REVELATION AND HE PRAYED TOWARD THE TEMPLE AND I HAVE READ THAT MANY TIMES AND IT'S HELPED ME. SO DID GOD SET HIM UP TO HELP YOU AND ME? I DON'T KNOW. I JUST KNOW IT'S IN HIS SOVEREIGNTY. I JUST KNOW THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED, GOD, AS FAR AS GOD WAS CONCERNED, JONAH NEVER WAS OUTSIDE OF THE WILL OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. We'll understand it better by and by. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I have a feeling Jonah will have a lot to say about that on the other side. Brother Jonah, Brother Brandham said something about here. Can you EXPLAIN THAT TO ME? WELL, SIT DOWN. I'VE been waiting a long time to explain this one. Verse 28. For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done. And now, Lord, behold their threatenings, and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word by stretching forth thine hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done by the name OF THY HOLY CHILD, JESUS. NOW, catch it. AND WHEN THEY HAD PRAYED, NOW I WATCH THIS. WHEN THEY HAD PRAYED, THE PLACE was shaken where they were assembled TOGETHER AND THEY WERE ALL FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND THEY SPAKE THE WORD OF GOD WITH BOLDNESS. THEY WEREN'T BEING BORN AGAIN AGAIN. [laughter] THEY WEREN'T BEING BORN AGAIN AGAIN. THEY WERE BORN AGAIN IN ACTS TWO, &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THEY COME BACK AFTER THE TRIALS OF LIFE, HOW MANY HAVE HAD A FEW TRIALS AFTER YOU MET THE LORD? AND WHEN THEY CAME BACK UH YOU KNOW DOWN IN THEIR SPIRIT AND THE DEVIL HAVING WOUNDED YOU KNOW THEIR MIND AND THE OPPRESSION YOU CAN IMAGINE YOU'RE PREACHING YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO STAND FOR RIGHT YOU'RE BEING THROWN IN PRISON AND THREATENED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND LASHED AND WHIPPED AND YOU GET BACK I'M HERE TO TELL YOU WE'RE JUST HUMAN BEINGS YOU'RE GOING TO COME BACK IN FRAIL AND WEAK AND BECAUSE YOU WENT THROUGH SOMETHING I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT GOD CAN COME AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN ONE FILLING MANY REFILLINGS AND DO YOU KNOW ALL IT TOOK IT TOOK 30 SECONDS OF QUOTING THE WORD BACK TO GOD AND WITHIN 30 SECONDS THE HOLY GHOST FELL UPON HIM AGAIN. OH, WHAT COULD YOU DO TODAY? NO WONDER JESUS QUOTED THE WORD. WHEN YOU QUOTE THE WORD AND BROTHER BENHAM SAID, YOU PUT IT ON YOUR LIPS AND YOU'RE A SON OF GOD OR A DAUGHTER OF GOD. THAT'S THE SAME AS GOD SPEAKING. WHY DON'T YOU PUT THE WORD INTO [screaming] ACTION? &gt;&gt; IT ONLY TOOK 30 SECONDS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; FOR THEM TO QUOTE GOD'S WORD BACK TO GOD. DAVID said and God CAME DOWN TO PROVE YOU'RE RIGHT. David said that now here's here's your reward for believing it &gt;&gt; and it cured them &gt;&gt; fixed them in a moment because they come back and he says and they spake the word of God with boldness. They were ready to go right back out again. I I like that. I like the fact that no matter what the devil can do to me, I can come into THE PRESENCE OF GOD, GET A REFILLING, and I can go right back to the battle. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; SO AS I SAID, YOU KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, AS WE move deeper into this theme of the greatest battle ever fought, um, you know, THE THE MATERIAL EVEN THAT I'M giving assumes a born again experience by the indwelling OF THE HOLY GHOST. NOW, WITHOUT THAT, without that, LET ME JUST SAY BEFORE I JUST LEAP PAST THAT, let me say the obvious that without the new birth, ALTHOUGH ANY OF GOD'S word is health to all your flesh, that's the truth. That's never not true. &gt;&gt; The word of God is health to all, body, spirit, soul. The word of God is health to all your flesh. Um, but you you need to first win the battle of the soul BEFORE YOU EVER TRY MASTERING THE BATTLE of the mind. &gt;&gt; So, we're talking about the battle of the mind. But I want to say it again. You need to win the battle of the soul. &gt;&gt; You need to be You must be born again. &gt;&gt; You must surrender your life in a COMPLETE REPENTANCE. THE HOLY GHOST IS NOT HARD TO GET. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO FAST AND WAIT ON IT. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HAVE A THOROUGH, COMPLETE, UNEQUIVOCAL, UNHESITATING, FULL DISCLOSED REPENTANCE. AND TO SAY, "LORD, I REPENT OF EVERYTHING I'VE EVER BEEN, EVERYTHING THAT I AM. I DON'T WANT TO BE ME ANYMORE. I WANT TO BE YOU. I'M INVITING YOU TO COME INSIDE OF ME. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU," BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, AND THEN SAY, "YOU DON'T HAVE THE HOLY GHOST." YOU MAKE GOD A LIAR. FOR IF YOU REPENT, YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And the people struggle AND TO TO TO REALLY HAVE THAT LIFE-CHANGING THING BECAUSE THEY THE REPENTANCE IS NOT COMPLETELY FULL. &gt;&gt; It's conditional. You still want a lot of your own way and you want to keep a lot of your own trends. &gt;&gt; You want to be a Christian. You want to be born again, but you don't want it at the cost of what the Lord might change and take from you. You have the things that you've worked hard on and you've invested and by golly, you want to keep going with it. Well, I'm here to tell you, you might wait 40 days or 400 days. I don't know. Uh you might fast until till you're so sick you can't stand up. But God will wait until that box car, Brother Bam said, until that box car is packed in there correctly. And that's the human heart. That's not a that's not you living, you know, a perfect sanctified life, never making a mistake. HOW LONG DO I GOT TO GO WITHOUT MAKING A SINGLE ERROR? WELL, you just made one saying that. See, cuz there's no none good, no not one. &gt;&gt; How long do I got to GO BEING PERFECT? YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THE PART THE POINT IS THAT THE THE BOX CAR IS THE HUMAN HEART. AND GOD IS LOOKING IN THAT HEART. And as long as THAT REPENTANCE IS NOT THOROUGH, HE WILL NOT SEAL THE VESSEL. &gt;&gt; SO I WOULD JUST SAY TO YOU TODAY, JUST THROW IT ALL UP. THROW UP YOUR HANDS AND SAY, "LORD, I'M GOING TO TRUST YOU FOR MY LIFE, AND I'M GOING TO COMPLETELY ABSOR I'M GOING TO COMPLETELY REPENT AND TURN AWAY FROM ALL MY FORMER LIFE, AND I WILL ONLY GO FORWARD IN THE DIRECTION AND ATTACH MYSELF TO THE THINGS AND ACCOMPLISH THE TASK AND ACHIEVE THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT ME TO achieve and accomplish." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll be glad you did that on the other side. Go ahead and keep chasing the world. It's all going to ash and cinder. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Chase it. Invest your whole life. Sink everything you got into this world. Fortune and glory, education and career. Nothing wrong with it. But go after. Listen. Let me tell you something, friends. Just remember this. The the more that you eat from the tree of knowledge, the more death you take into yourself. Now we understand the balance of that. This is a product of the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; You understand the very fact that that this was finally put in type set and could be mass-produced so that all the people could have it. That's the tree of knowledge taught taught them how to do a a printing press. &gt;&gt; We're grateful for all that we you drove here in vehicles today. Not saying go back to horse and buggy. I'm simply saying that in all of it, you came from God. You're going back to God. And so WHY WOULD NOT YOUR WHOLE LIFE IN BETWEEN COMING AND GOING before God? &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; and so just remember that you need Christ needs to be first. He needs to be the center. Brother Brandham says don't make him second. &gt;&gt; He said he does not want to be second. He does not deserve to be second. He deserves to be first. See, SO YOU NEED [clears throat] TO WIN THAT BATTLE OF the soul before you ever try to win the battle of the mind. Because even if you join a commune and live in the wilderness and and uh you you know you you can become a Buddhist monk and and have mind control, that's still that's you're still going to perish with the Antichrist, you know, if you reject God's word and and and God shows himself even to the ancient people. Say, "What about people who never knew about Jesus?" The ancient people didn't know about Jesus. &gt;&gt; But yet Jesus preached to them in hell and their souls in prison. &gt;&gt; Well, how could he how could he leave them in hell when THEY NEVER EVEN KNEW ABOUT HIM? BECAUSE PAUL SAID THEY KNEW IT BY NATURE. GOD REVEALED HIMSELF TO THEM IN NATURE and they knew they're not there. He said THEY'RE WITHOUT EXCUSE. SO, HOW ABOUT YOU NOT TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS SOVEREIGN AND JUST LET GOD FIGURE OUT WHAT'S SOVEREIGN. He's got a plan for heathens and nations who never knew him. Don't worry. God has a way. He he uh he doesn't need you or me to be the general manager of his universe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So just stop arguing with him. Stop, drop, and roll and just say, "Lord, I just need you." &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I It's like years ago, I heard a a story. It was supposedly a true story about two buddies who one was a doctor and one was a lawyer. And they fell into a old tent revival way back in the early days. I forget. It might have been Moody's revival. I don't remember who it was. And um might have been seemed like it might have been Billy Sunday in a revival. I don't remember. And uh man, when the altar call came, they both hit the old sawdust trail and fell down at the altar. And the doctor and lawyer side by side, boohoo and snotting and pleading and you know, calling on the name of the Lord. And in a few minutes, uh the uh the doctor stood up and just raised his hands. Glory, hallelujah, I'm free. &gt;&gt; And turned around, went back to his seat. That lawyer stayed there hours and hours and they beat him on the back and tried everything in the world and finally finally he broke through and he raised up and said, "I'm free." And they got going walking home and the uh he and the doc and the lawyer looks over at his buddy. He said, "Hey, doc, can I ask you a question?" He goes, "Yeah, sure. What's up?" And he says, "Uh, you know, I noticed that when you got down at the altar," he said, "when I got down right beside you," he said, "I had to roll around for hours to finally break through." He said, "You were down five minutes and got up and walked away free." He said, "I don't understand that." And he said, "Oh, that's easy to explain. That's just cuz I'm a doctor and you're a lawyer." And he said, "What in the world does that have to do with it?" He says, "Well," he said, "when I got down there," he said, "when you got down there, you started pleading your case. When I got down there, I just told him, "I'm guilty." [laughter] So, no need to try to plead your case. DON'T BE A LAWYER. Just be just say, "Lord, I'm guilty." Hallelujah. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the message, "And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies." You good? He says, "We are now a wheat, a grain of wheat in God's garner." Talking about because we're born again. When we was a cuckle, see, this is before we were born again. When we was a cockleber and God changed us from a cuckle to a grain of wheat by the new birth. Amen. He he took the old fallen nature that you're born with the cucker and annihilated that and a gene of God Zoe life came forward and that's a wheat life. Amen. &gt;&gt; SO HE SAYS GOD CHANGED us from a cucker to a grain of wheat makes the fruits different. Changing your own mind, your own ideas. It's the greatest miracle that ever happened when a man or woman is born again of the spirit of God and becomes a new creation in Christ Jesus. SO THE NEW BIRTH CHANGES YOUR IDEAS. It changes the fruits in your life. YOU THINK DIFFERENT, THEREFORE YOU ACT DIFFERENT. I THINK THEREFORE I AM. SO YOU THINK DIFFERENT, YOU SPEAK DIFFERENT, YOU ACT DIFFERENT, YOU WALK DIFFERENT, YOU LIVE DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; You're bearing different fruits. See, now he GOES ON IN THE POWER OF TRANSFORMATION 1965. If it's a genuine spirit anointing the genuine seed, it can't do nothing BUT BEAR A SON OR daughter of God. But the GENUINE SPIRIT CAN COME UPON A cockbar seed. The rain can fall upon a cocklear and it will MAKE IT LIVE JUST THE SAME AS IT FALLS UPON A WHEAT AND makes it live. But by their fruits you know them. See? So you've got a a field of wheat and a field of weeds, cockleberers. AND WHEN THE RAIN COMES, THEY BOTH GROW AND THEY BOTH REJOICE. You see, remember, and I and I don't want TO I DON'T I'M DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO GO THIS way today because it's it's I have it for the next installment, but one of the one of the um main weapons or draw of the Antichrist spirit &gt;&gt; to lead so many billions &gt;&gt; into destruction at Armageddon. THE THING THAT REMEMBER WHEN THAT HAPPENS THEY'VE KILLED TO THE LAST MAN THE LAST RIGHTEOUS PERSON. &gt;&gt; There's no more righteous people in the earth. They've killed all the foolish virgin. They've murdered all the 144,000. They put Moses and Elijah to death. They have killed to the last man, woman, boy, and girl, all the righteous seed. And there's no one left in the earth but unrighteous people. &gt;&gt; And therefore, Armageddon comes forward. Christ comes out in Revelation 19, the armies of heaven to participate. Moses and Elijah are resurrected. And that's a great sign. But you say what it how could this Antichrist spirit lead so many into deception and so few escape it? And that is because of lying wonders. &gt;&gt; They're wonders, but they're lying wonders. See, now I'm not going to go too deeply in it today, but let me just let me just give you this nugget and we're going to move on. you you can walk into uh I mean almost just take your pick. Just spin the wheel and take your pick. Anyone you pick is going to probably show it. Any charismatic meeting, any evangelical meeting, any Pentecostal meeting, you'll walk in there and you'll see people shouting AND REJOICING AND IT WON'T MATTER. WOMEN with bobbed hair painted look like Jezebel, &gt;&gt; you know, and and and and even vulgar dressed and they'll be shouting and screaming and praising the Lord and be crying real tears. &gt;&gt; I don't mean crocodile tears. I mean they really feel it. &gt;&gt; You understand? That's a lying wonder. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE PEOPLE LOOK AT THAT AND GO, "THAT'S THE ANSWER. I THAT'S WHAT I WANT. ALL THEY WANT IS THAT IS THAT EXUBERANT FEELING. THAT'S LIKE A DRUG to them. &gt;&gt; They go RIGHT BACK. IF YOU GIVE THEM THE WORD OF GOD, THEY WON'T BELIEVE THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING. YOU TRY TO TELL THEM HOW A MAN SHOULD LIVE AND DRESS AND ACT AND A WOMAN SHOULD LIVE AND WHAT WE SHOULD DO AND HOW WE SHOULD SPEAK RIGHT AWAY YOU'RE A HERETIC AND THROW AND SHOW THEM THE DOOR. &gt;&gt; SO DON'T BE MISLED BY LYING WONDERS. &gt;&gt; I UNDERSTAND YOU CAN GO INTO THEIR CONCERTS AND EVERYTHING'S BLACKED OUT AND BLUE LIGHTS ARE ON THEM AND AND THE WHOLE VIBE IS A CONCERT. IT'S NOT THEY CALL IT A CHURCH SERVICE. IT'S NOT A A CHURCH SERVICE. THAT'S A THAT'S A VIBE. THAT'S A CONCERT. I'M NOT HERE TO HAVE A CONCERT VIBE. I WANT TO HAVE A CHURCH SERVICE. &gt;&gt; I I SAY, "MAN, TURN THE LIGHTS ON. LET'S RAISE UP OUR HANDS. LET'S REJOICE. LET'S SING." &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'M NOT HERE TO DANCE AND GROOVE. I WANT TO PRAISE THE LORD WITH ALL MY HEART AND ALL MY MIND, ALL MY UNDERSTANDING, ALL MY STRENGTH. &gt;&gt; SEE, AND SO THE WORLD IS FILLED WITH THOSE LYING WONDERS. PODCASTERS WITH MILLIONS AND MILLIONS CLAIMING TO BE CHRISTIANS, YOU KNOW, WITH PIERCINGS AND TATTOOS EVERYWHERE AND AND EVERY FOURTH WORD IS THE FBOMB AND EVERY SIXTH WORD IS IS THIS UH TERRIBLE THING. AND I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GO DOWN THAT WAY. THAT'S A LYING WONDER. THAT'S NOT A CHRISTIAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, that's a lying wonder in the whole world. I just say TO YOU TODAY, IF THAT if that KIND OF THING MESMERIZES YOU, DON'T FEEL BAD. IT MESMERIZED JOHN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; JOHN SAW THAT ANTICHRIST AND HE WAS SO STUNNED. Her beauty, her opulence, her grandeur, HER OH, IT WAS JUST JOHN SAID, "I MARVELED." AND IT LITERALLY TOOK THE ANGEL STANDING THERE HAD TO REBUKE HIM AND SAY, "DON'T MARVEL AT THAT. UNDER UNDER THOSE BEAUTIFUL SKIRTS IS THE BLOOD OF YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS HOLY. AND IT HAD JOHN HAD TO COME TO HIS SENSES. A LOT OF TIMES SOME OF US JUST HAVE TO COME TO OUR SENSES. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE CHASING AFTER THE WRONG THING. AND NO WONDER THE PREACHER WOULD GET UP HERE AND SAY, "COME TO YOUR SENSES, MAN." &gt;&gt; What are you feeding on? &gt;&gt; SO HE SAYS, "IF IT'S A GENUINE ANOINTING, the genuine seed, it can do nothing but bear a son or daughter of God. BUT THE GENUINE SPIRIT CAN COME UPON A COCKLE BARREL SEED. The rain can fall upon a cockar AND MAKE IT JUST THE SAME AS IT FALLS UPON A WHEAT PLANT. MAKES IT LIVE. BUT BY THEIR fruits you shall know them. See, watch. We're a fruit tree of God bearing his word. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO BECAUSE human beings, now that's that's scriptural. David called himself, I think, an an aloe tree, one place, a palm tree, another time, uh, in the Garden of Eden, he uses trees metaphorically, talking about the the the serpent, talking about Christ, talking about, you know, of this tree, you can of all the trees, but of this tree. So it's obviously a different tree because he just told him you can eat of all of them but you can't eat of this one. So it's got to be a different kind of a tree than this kind of a tree. &gt;&gt; You follow me? &gt;&gt; SO SO WE REALIZE THAT BECAUSE THAT WE ARE fruitbearing trees then evil spirits target our minds to capture a believer's will &gt;&gt; residing in your spirit. Your will resides in your spirit. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND BECAUSE THAT THE ENEMY KNOWS THAT YOU'RE A FRUITBEARING TREE. That's what humans are. You're a fruitbearing tree. Then he he he's constantly Satan's strategy IS TO CONSTANTLY TRIED TO INTRODUCE to you uh TEMPTING THOUGHTS. AND A CONSTANT A CONSTANT HOW YOU KNOW IT'S THE DEVIL IS THAT THEY WILL CONSTANTLY TRY TO DRAW YOU AWAY from God's word which is supposed to be your true guide for life. See, SO SATAN'S STRATEGY then in introducing these tempting thoughts UH BECAUSE IT IT SPEAKS OF YOU REMEMBER YOU REMEMBER LAST UH I think in the last installment I think the fourth installment might have been the second I think it was the last one where we we made WE SHOWED YOU HOW THAT BROTHER Brandham had devoted a really significant portion of his ministry teaching about the the battle of the mind of the human mind between divine and demonic influence. BECAUSE HERE'S WHY THAT'S THAT KIND OF PREACHING IS IMPORTANT. THE NEW BIRTH DOES NOT insulate you from that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? YOU'VE GOT TO USE THE WORD TO PRESS ON TO VICTORY over that. &gt;&gt; THE NEW WHAT DOES THE NEW BIRTH DO FOR ME? IT GIVES YOU THE FIGHTING CHANCE. &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THE NEW BIRTH, YOU CAN'T EVEN AGREE WITH ALL OF GOD'S WORD. YOU HAVE TO BE BORN AGAIN SO THAT THEN YOU CAN HAVE THE WORD REVEALED TO YOU SO THAT THEN YOU CAN STAND ON IT. SO THEN YOU CAN WALK IN IT. SO SATAN CAN BE DEFEATED. &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU ALWAYS WILL. JAMES SAID THERE'S NO TEMPTATION HAS TAKEN YOU, BUT SUCH AS IS COMMON TO MAN. SO SO, SO PLEASE STOP WHINING AND CRYING. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO TEMPTATION TAKING YOU BUT SUCH AS IS COMMON TO MAN. OH, WOWY WY WOLF. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO ME? THERE AIN'T NOTHING HAPPENED TO YOU THAT AIN'T HAPPENED TIMES A MILLION IN YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN AGES PRIOR. AND YOU HAVEN'T SUFFERED UNDER BLOOD LIKE THEY DID. SO COME ON, LET'S BE MEN AND WOMEN. LET'S SAY, I'M HERE TO DO GOD'S WILL. I'M NOT HERE TO CRY ABOUT MY LIFE OR MY BIRTH OR MY FAMILY OR THIS HAPPENED TO ME OR THAT HAPPENED OR THIS PERSON DID THAT TO ME OR THIS PREACHER DID THAT TO ME. I'M HERE MARCHING TO ZION. [screaming] I'M NOT HERE TO BE DISTRACTED BY THE DEVIL. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO SAY I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGTHENS ME. &gt;&gt; Not here TO HEAR A PITY PARTY. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT SAYING WE DON'T HAVE WOUNDS. WE DO. NOT SAYING. BUT THERE'S THERE'S VICTORY FOR YOU, FRIENDS. I PROMISE YOU TWO THINGS. IF YOU TAKE GOD'S WORD, YOU'LL HAVE VICTORY. IF YOU DON'T TAKE GOD'S WORD, YOU'LL SIT IN THAT HURT FOREVER. &gt;&gt; YOU'LL NEVER BREAK FREE OF IT. NO PSYCHIATRIST, NO DRUGS, NO NOTHING CAN GIVE IT TO YOU. NO CHRISTIAN PSYCHOLOGY. ONLY THE POWER OF THE RISEN CHRIST CAN SET YOU FREE AND SHATTER THAT COMPLEX UPON YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; I KNOW THAT BY EXPERIENCE. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; FIGHT IT ALL YOU WANT. YOU'LL NEVER DEFEAT IT. &gt;&gt; SEE, because the reason, you know, THE IT'S ALL ABOUT DIVINE AND DEMONIC INFLUENCE. AND THE REASON IS THAT IT TOUCHES ON THIS AS WE SAID I THINK IT WAS LAST TIME THIS FUNDAMENTAL human capacity called choice. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE IT'S A HUMAN CAPACITY AS WE SAID TO YOU LAST TIME THEN IT'S A HUMAN VULNERABILITY. &gt;&gt; So this is WHERE THIS IS WHERE SATAN COMES. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY TO YOU TODAY I'M NOT GOING BACK TO REPREACH THAT MATERIAL. GO BACK AND LISTEN TO PART FOUR AGAIN. I WANNA I WANT TO PUT SOME COURAGE IN YOUR HEART TODAY TO SAY THAT THAT VULNERABILITY THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR FLESH BECAUSE IT'S NOT CONVERTED. &gt;&gt; YOUR SOUL IS CONVERTED. &gt;&gt; YOU BUT YOUR SPIRIT AND YOUR FLESH ARE NOT CONVERTED. YOUR MEMORY, REASON, CONSCIOUS EFFECTS AND IMAGINATIONS. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SO MUCH PRACTICAL PREACHING FROM THE APOSTLES ON HOW TO STAND FIRM, HOW TO CAST DOWN VAIN IMAGINATIONS, HOW TO EQUIP YOURSELF WITH THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND I WANT TO SAY TO YOU TODAY THAT WHILE YOU WILL REMAIN VULNERABLE THAT THAT THE THE OUTCOME OF THAT IS NOT INEVITABLE. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO FAIL. &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO TELL YOU YOU DO NOT HAVE TO. THAT ONCE YOU'RE BORN AGAIN, SATAN CANNOT FORCE YOU TO DO IT. BEFORE HE COULD, NOW HE CAN'T. YOU CAN WALK IN THE STATUTES OF THE [screaming] WORD OF GOD AND YOU CAN PRAY AND YOU CAN REPENT AND YOU CAN EAT ON FEED ON THE WORD OF GOD AND YOU CAN HAVE A VICTORIOUS LIFE. YOUR VULNERABILITY IS NOT AN INEVITABILITY TO FAIL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE FIRST LIE YOU NEED TO DEBUNK IN YOUR MIND. SATAN CANNOT FORCE YOU. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS here in the token, [clears throat] I'm not going to get to everything I've got on my notes today, but you got another 10, 15 minutes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; WE ONLY NEED THE TOKEN WITH us to make that word live again. Not only &gt;&gt; is that all we need, that's all that can. YEAH, &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO OTHER POWER THAT CAN MAKE THE WORD live &gt;&gt; is the token. THAT'S THE LIFE OF CHRIST IN YOU. SEE, THAT'S WHAT HE SENT THE token for &gt;&gt; IT. GIVE US THE STATEMENT. G GIVE US THAT STATEMENT AND WE KNOW IT'S THE TRUTH. The the NEW TOKEN, HE CALLS IT A NEW TOKEN, SHOWS JESUS HAS MET EVERY REQUIREMENT FOR us and he is here. The new token, THE TOKEN OF THE HOLY SPIRIT shows that WE KNOW THAT JESUS DIED TO FREE US FROM ALL THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE FROM THE WORLD KNOWING what he did. THEY KNOW WHAT HE DID AT CALVARY, BUT THEIR LIFE DEMONSTRATES THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A CONCEPT THAT IT CAME TO FREE THEM FROM SIN BECAUSE NOTHING CHANGES IN THEIR LIFE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO BROTHER BRANDHAM IS DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN WHAT THE WORLD MIGHT CALL THE NEW BIRTH AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS. The token of the Holy Spirit shows that we know that Jesus died to free us from all the things of the world. AND THE TOKEN THAT IS UPON US proves it by vindicating WHAT HE SAID. NOW, HOW CAN A man claim TO HOLD THAT TOKEN IN FRONT OF HIM AND DENY WHAT this word says? It isn't so. SEE, IT CAN'T BE SO. GOD CAN'T LIE about his own word. And because he is here, we have the right to all that he purchased for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hold these truths to be self-evident. I DECLARE independence from the tyranny of Lucifer AND I PLEDGE MY ALLEGIANCE TO a new king. &gt;&gt; ONE WHO CAN FREE me from sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So when YOU ACTIVELY BRING YOUR thoughts actively you bring them &gt;&gt; actively under THE AUTHORITY OF GOD'S WORD. FRIENDS, do you realize that you OPERATE THE HOLY GHOST POWER SENT TO MAKE THE WORD LIVE IN YOU? THE HOLY GHOST POWER IS SENT TO MAKE THE WORD live in you. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU ACQUIES, WHEN YOU AGREE, WHEN YOU ALIGN YOUR LIFE WITH THE TOKEN LIFE, THEN YOU ARE LITERALLY ACTIVATED. YOU YOU HAVE ACTIVATED GOD'S AUTHORITY, GOD'S POWER, AND THAT'S THE WHOLE PLAN THAT HE'S ALWAYS HAD IS TO BE LIVING AND PUTTING THE AUTHORITY IN HIS CHURCH. IF YOU SAY TO THIS, &gt;&gt; see now, BROTHER BRANDHAM, HERE'S BROTHER BRANDHAM PROVING THAT FROM A PARADOX 1964. NOW, WHAT IS IT? CHRIST COMING TO HIS BODY. CHRIST IS THE WORD. WE ALL KNOW THE ANOINTING IS CHRIST THAT COMES ON THE WORD that makes the word live. Is that right? &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE ANOINTING. CHRIST IS THE ANOINTING. THE SPIRIT THAT COMES UPON THE WORD [clears throat] THAT QUICKENS the word to MAKE IT LIVE. NOW THE WORD IS IN YOUR HEART. DO YOU BELIEVE IN DIVINE HEALING? &gt;&gt; Whatever more. &gt;&gt; See, AND CHRIST THE ANOINTING COMING TO HIS BODY. SEE, THERE'S WHERE THE CONNECTION IS. IT'S CHRIST COMING TO OMNIPOTENCE MEET. HE HE BRINGS A GENE OF GOD TO LIFE. ANNIHILATES YOUR OLD NATURE. AND WHILE YOUR FLESH AND SPIRIT REMAIN UNCONVERTED, HE LIVES ON THE INSIDE. AND YOU BRING THIS BODY SUBJECT TO HIS WORD. YOU DO THAT. &gt;&gt; HE'S HERE TO ANOINT IT, BUT YOU HAVE TO LET THE MIND WHICH WAS IN CHRIST BE IN YOU. &gt;&gt; SEE, now that's THE WAY THE KINGDOM WORKS. AND CONVERSELY, SO NOW, SO CONVERSELY, YOU SAY, "WELL, I I I FIND SOMETIMES WHILE I BELIEVE THAT, BROTHER JASON, BOY, GETTING THAT INTO MY PRACTICAL DAILY LIFE, I I'D HATE FOR EVERYONE IN HERE TO KNOW how often I fail at that. I'd hate for you to know how often I fail at it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let me just LET ME JUST TRY TO help you. The same way that his word, his token, his spirit comes to make the word live, it is those unguarded thoughts that although they did not necessarily originate from you, they will if left unchecked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They didn't come from you. &gt;&gt; Something spoke it into your mind. THAT'S WHERE THE battleground is. See, &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU AND THAT'S WHY THE WORD TELLS US WE CAST DOWN OF VAIN IMAGINATION. WE'RE TO BRING EVERY THOUGHT, EVERY THOUGHT, every thought subject. WE'RE TO BRING IT TO THE HOLY SPIRIT. These are things that you do. YOU UNDERSTAND? AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE UNGUARDED THOUGHTS, WHEN YOU DON'T DO THAT, uh even THOUGH THEY DIDN'T ORIGINATE FROM YOU, THEY COME FROM THE DEVIL. And if you leave them unchecked, they will DOMINATE YOUR THINKING. AND IT MIGHT NOT START THAT WAY ON DAY ONE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT EVERY DAY YOU LEAVE THAT UNCHECKED. EVERY DAY THAT YOU DON'T CHECK THE DEVIL IN HIS MOVE. HOLD ON HERE, BOY. I DON'T THINK LIKE THAT. &gt;&gt; And and and AS FOR ME IN MY HOUSE, WE SHALL SERVE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE YOU'RE NOT WELCOME HERE. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT INTERESTED IN HAVING THAT IN MY LIFE. OH, SURE. IT COULD PUT MORE ZEROS IN MY BANK ACCOUNT, BUT IT'LL TAKE ME AWAY FROM THE WORD OF GOD. I'M CHECKING THAT THOUGHT RIGHT NOW. I WILL NOT HAVE THAT THOUGHT IN MY MIND. &gt;&gt; SEE, IF YOU DON'T DO THAT, YOU SAY, "OH, WELL, I'VE GOT THE HOLY GHOST. IT'LL DO IT FOR ME. IT'LL DO IT FOR YOU. It's the only one who can do IT FOR YOU. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO LET IT DO IT FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He's not GOING TO FORCE HIMSELF. IT WILL DOMINATE YOUR thinking until IT HAS YOU IN SUCH A GRIP that sometimes, let me LET ME JUST SAY THIS and I I'm going to come to a close. I want to make one more point, but before I do, I'm just going to go off my notes a little bit and make this point, BROTHER BRANDHAM. AND I didn't I I I've got the quote if somebody needs to read it uh from he preached human demonology four times and the fourth time he preached it he's talking about and I'm just going to paraphrase because I don't have it here but he's talking about divine healing in the flesh people with sickness and diseases &gt;&gt; and HE'S GOING TO CORRELATE THEM VERY VERY CLEAR clearly and he's actually going to talk about both the flesh and the spirit and he's and the point THAT HE'S GOING TO MAKE IS IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE DEMON SPIRITS on a disease in your body. And he AND HE SAYS, "NOW PEOPLE WOULD SAY, "Brother Brandham, I'M NOT POSSESSED of a devil." And he would say, "Cuz see, they're thinking of Legion. &gt;&gt; You understand? They're thinking of Legion. I'm not possessed of a devil. I'm not a raving maniac living in the tombs breaking chains. I've just got a tumor. I don't I don't I'm not possessed of a devil." AND BROTHER BRANDHAM ACTUALLY WILL SAY, OKAY, I'M NOT SAYING ALTOGETHER POSSESSED BECAUSE IT'S ALL it's all wording. You understand? He said, I LET'S JUST SAY THAT IT'S O OPPRESSED. MAYBE YOU'RE NOT POSSESSED LIKE LEGION, but remember that the Bible says a demon is a tormentor. &gt;&gt; That's what he does. See, he afflicts people. That's why the Bible says, "If any be afflicted, let them call for the elders of the church, the ministry of the church. the prayer of faith shall save them. See, so sometimes, AND THEN BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY, "SO WHEN IT'S OVER HERE IN THE FLESH, IT MIGHT BE SOME sickness or disease." He said, "When it's over here in your spirit, you're not possessed of a devil, but you're being oppressed by an EVIL SPIRIT." AND I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY HERE TODAY. I don't even THINK YOU COULD GIVE ME YOUR WHOLE LIFE STORY, AND I MIGHT COULDN'T TELL YOU. A PROPHET COULD PROBABLY TELL YOU. A PROPHET FIGURED OUT THAT A WOMAN HAD SUCH A SPIRIT OF FEAR BECAUSE AS A LITTLE GIRL WEARING A A A YELLOW JACKET, A DOG CHASED HER UP ON A PORCH when she was a child. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, I don't know. I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT. I'M NOT A PROPHET. I YOU CAN SAY, "WELL, THIS HAPPENED TO ME IN MY CHILDHOOD. THIS HAPPENED TO ME IN MY MARRIAGE. THIS HAPPENED TO ME IN THIS CHURCH. This happened to me. I don't you know, I DON'T KNOW, FRIENDS. ALL I CAN DO IS GIVE YOU THE FIX ALL." &gt;&gt; AND I PROMISE YOU, IT'S A FIX ALL. &gt;&gt; IT'LL IT'LL FIX ANYTHING. IT HAS THE ANSWER FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE. NO MATTER WHAT THE DEVIL CAN DO, IT CAN REPAIR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT CAN MAKE YOU CLEAN. IT CAN TAKE THE VILE SINNER AND MAKE THEM CLEAN. &gt;&gt; IT CAN BREAK THE POWER OF THE ENEMY. AND BROTHER BRENNHAM SAYS SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, YOU GET AN OPPRESSION ON YOUR SPIRIT. AND HE SAYS THAT MAKES YOU DO THINGS THAT AREN'T RIGHT. HE SAID, "WELL, IS HE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE THE NEW BIRTH OR AFTER THE NEW BIRTH?" I'm not TRYING TO BREAK THAT DOWN TO YOU TODAY. I'M JUST SIMPLY SHOWING YOU THAT IT'S AN OPPRESSIVE DEMON AND AND MAYBE SOMETHING GAVE YOU ACCESS. BROTHER BRANDHAM GOES INTO A LOT OF DETAILS. IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. I don't want to lose you. I WANT YOU TO STAY RIGHT WITH me and get ready to close. SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT HOW THAT, you know, things can happen IN OUR LIVES. SOMETIMES THERE'S A NATURAL PROPENSITY. SOMETIMES THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM CALLED IT THE GRABAG OF LIFE. YOU JUST you inherited it. He talks about people who WHO HAVE A, YOU KNOW, he catches a man in the in the in the line. He says, "Now, sir," he says, "I see. Okay, I see what's up. You you you're you're you worry. &gt;&gt; You worry all the time." And he said, "Now, that's going to give you cancer, arthritis, and all kinds of things if you keep doing that." &gt;&gt; See, he's trying to get the man to go against the way he was born. &gt;&gt; So, BROTHER BRANDON WOULDN'T REQUIRE THAT IF IT WASN'T POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; You understand? He says, "Now, &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "NOW, YOU GOT THAT." HE SAID, "YOU got that?" I think it was from his mother or maybe a grandmother. I can't remember. I haven't read the quote in a long time. He says, "Or maybe it was A GRANDFATHER." HE SAID, "THAT CAME ON YOU AND IT JUMPED OVER AND LANDED on you." He said, "You're always crossing bridges before you get to them." &gt;&gt; SEE, SO YOU GOT THIS MAN CROSSING BRIDGES. HE'S WORRYING. Here's a girl afraid and a dog chased her. And who, YOU KNOW, I'M SO BROTHER BRADAM SAID, YOU KNOW, WE'RE WE'RE BORN with weaknesses and somehow Satan can see what they are. He watches and studies us as children. HE CAN SPOT A MINISTRY OR GIFT. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID HE'LL TRY TO TAKE THAT CHILD OUT PREMATURELY AND KILL THEM BECAUSE he's a he can SEE A GIFT THERE AND HE'S AFRAID OF IT. WHAT IT MIGHT DO, HE'S NOT GOING to take a chance. And it has to be the Holy Spirit. I I probably should have been dead five or six times growing up as a child. It's very uh daring and adventuresome and I was always swimming out further THAN I COULD GET BACK AND I WAS ALWAYS BEING IN PLACE I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AND I WAS ALWAYS DOING STUFF THAT IN THAT THAT RISKED MY LIFE. THAT'S JUST THAT'S HOW I WAS. AND I REALIZED FOUR OR FIVE TIMES, FOUR OR FIVE TIMES, [snorts] &gt;&gt; I SHOULD have been dead, &gt;&gt; BUT THE LORD KNEW I NEEDED to stand here today and preach to you. &gt;&gt; See, and it's Satan trying to kill me. And and and angels are moving. YOU DON'T REALIZE THERE'S A WHOLE ANOTHER REALM, FRIENDS. ANGELS ARE MOVING, INTERDICTING ON YOUR BEHALF. &gt;&gt; DON'T EVER FEEL ALONE. YOU'RE NEVER ALONE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BE ENCOURAGED. THE LORD KNOWS ABOUT IT. THAT'S WHAT JEHOVAH GYRA MEANS. THE LORD SEES AND THE LORD WILL SEE TO IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; He's our provider. THAT'S EX THAT'S HOW HE DOES IT. &gt;&gt; HE'S YOUR PROVIDER CUZ HE SEES WHAT YOU NEED AND HE'LL SEE TO IT. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TRUST HIM. ABRAHAM JUST TRUSTED HIM. HE JUST KEPT GOING FORWARD. SEE? &gt;&gt; SO, SO, SO WE FIND THAT WHATEVER, HOWEVER THE DEVIL, YOU KNOW, HE HE BROTHER M SAID, YOU GOT TO KEEP YOUR GUARD UP OVER SOME OF THOSE AREAS. SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BOTHER YOU real easy wouldn't bother ME AT ALL. AND VICE VERSA. SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH MIGHT MIGHT KNOCK ME OUT IF IF IF I GIVE IT ATTENTION. SO, WE DON'T KNOW. IT'S THE GRABAG OF LIFE. I I I DON'T KNOW. AND AND LOOK, BROTHER BRANDHAM KNOWING WHAT IT WAS DIDN'T FIX IT. SAY, "OH, IF I COULD JUST HAVE BROTHER BRANDOM, HE COULD TELL ME." THAT DOESN'T FIX IT. ONLY YOUR FAITH CAN FIX IT. &gt;&gt; SEE, and and I'm HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. I'VE HAD THINGS IN MY LIFE AND AND AND THAT HAUNTED ME. MAYBE THINGS OF CHILDHOOD, MAYBE A PROPENSITY. I DON'T KNOW WHO CAN SAY. IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT HAUNTED ME AND AND AND HAD SUCH A GRIP ON MY LIFE THAT I ACTUALLY HAD TO GO THROUGH A PRAYER LINE AND CALL FOR THE MINISTERS LAY THEIR HANDS ON ME AND AND DRIVE THAT THING AWAY FROM ME AND I CAME OUT OF THERE CLEAN. I'VE ALSO HAD TIMES WHERE THE DEVIL AFFLICTED MY MIND, AFFLICTED MY SPIRIT COMPLEX HERE IN A COMPLEX THERE AND NO AMOUNT OF PRAYER WOULD DO IT UNTIL I WAS SITTING IN A SERVICE AND I HEARD THE WORD AND WHILE THE MINISTER YET SPAKE THESE WORDS, A POWER CAME UPON ME AND BROKE THAT THING. AND I AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, I STAYED MORE FREE BY THE FREEDOM OF THE WORD THAN I EVER DID GETTING PRAYED FOR. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT GOD HAS SUPPLIED YOU WITH TODAY, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; JUST SPEAK THE WORD AND GO FORWARD. THAT'S WHY HE SAID TO MOSES, "WHY CRY UNTO ME? SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE that they go forward. I've already commissioned you." &gt;&gt; See, SO SO YOU KNOW, I I WANT TO SAY THIS AND I'M GOING TO COME TO MY CLOSING POINT. God's economy. And this is this is important. And I've I'm I've thought a lot how to explain this because I want to be clear. I'M GOING TO START IT BY saying God's economy is not a onetoone. First of all, Jesus multiplies. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So if he couldn't, I've said this before, then if you spent 10 years in sin, he would need 10 years to get you out. If you had 10 years worth of filth, he would need 10 years to clean you up. But because Jesus multiplies, I've seen people with 20 years, 40 years, and Jesus convert them and and clean them up in three or four months. You can't even tell they're the same human &gt;&gt; and they'll never look back AND NEVER GO BACK AND THEY ONLY GET STRONGER and stronger and stronger because his economy isn't one to one. He he doesn't do it that way. Listen, you know, I remember I I remember uh brother Matt and I and brother Dale Smith and and I had the crazy I don't know who in the world inflicted my mind was such a bad idea. We we we hired a u a trainer because we need all needed to get in shape. And so we we went for some private tutoring. I wasn't about to bring me and my ministry team into a co-ed class of men and women. And so I I hired a trainer and I said, "Don't worry, Brother Matt, Brother Dale. I'll pay for it. I'll pay for it all. I've got a Serbian trainer and his name [laughter] his name was Buoyen and you may have heard some of the story before and we called him Ivan the Terrible. He was Serbian and actually he was quite he was quite intelligent. He had actually been on the training squad uh part of the part of the physio training squad for um Novak Djokovic when he was a junior in junior leagues before he turned pro. And so in Serbia, back in Serbia, this is where Boyen was from. And man, he was rough. [laughter] We called him Ivan the terrible. And uh, Brother Dale, Brother Dale said one time, they said, "Well, how do you like your trainer?" He said, "I liked him pretty good till he tried to FOLD ME LIKE A TACO." I said, "Smith, you're one of a kind, bro." But but he he made this he made this statement THAT UH CUZ I HAD I'D MISSED SOME CLASSES. He and he he took me aside. He said, "Jason, I'm going to tell you." He said the way your body works, he said you can train ever so hard. He said, 'But if you go two weeks, just two weeks with no training, he said your body almost starts back at zero. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you just have to go back to the starting point and come out of the gates again and just recover all of that. Now, that's that's not a perfect statement, but that's that's a general guideline. You you it's it's all about discipline. It's not conquering the world. It's just a discipline of a healthier lifestyle. So, but but when we when we think of the economy of God, it doesn't work like that because Satan would like to get you to believe &gt;&gt; that, oh, you you came to church, you heard a sermon, YOU WERE SO DELIVERED, YOU WERE SO CLEAN, YOU WERE WALKING ON CLOUDS, TWO OR THREE DAYS LATER, HE STUMBLED YOU AGAIN. OH, WELL, I GUESS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO START BACK AT zero all over again. That's not true. &gt;&gt; I want to break that lie. That's not true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Leviticus 26 uh 7-9. You can catch up to me, brother Mark, if you want. And ye shall chase your enemies. Leviticus 26:7-9. Ye shall chase your enemies, and they SHALL FALL BEFORE YOU BY THE SWORD. AND FIVE of you shall chase a hundred and a hundred OF YOU SHALL PUT 10,000 TO flight and your enemies SHALL FALL BEFORE YOU BY THE sword for I will have respect unto you and make you fruitful and multiply you and establish my covenant with you. So, so actually that in the in the amplified that ninth VERSE SAYS, "I WILL BE leaning toward you with favor and regard for you, rendering you fruitful, MULTIPLYING YOU AND ESTABLISHING AND RATIFYING MY covenant with you." Deuteronomy 32:es 30 to 31. How should one chase a thousand and TWO PUT 10,000 TO FLIGHT except their rock had sold them? Their their false gods that they had trusted in. Their rock had sold them and the Lord had shut them up for their rock is not as our rock. Now, BOTH OF THESE PASSAGES ACTUALLY SHOW A A A 5X A 400% jump in effectiveness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Per person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IT'S A 5X PER PERSON. &gt;&gt; You understand? When when the Lord IS WITH THEM. SO, WHAT WE FIND IS IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE ON the Lord's side, uh [screaming] the math changes. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? WHEN YOU'RE ON THE LORD'S SIDE, THE MATH CHANGES. HIS KINGDOM IS NOT ONE TO ONE. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? NOW, BROTHER BRANDON PICKS THAT UP IN THE MESSAGE. WHY? 1961. What he could DO IF HE COULD EVER GET ONE PERSON IN HIS GRIP JUST SO HE CAN HOLD THAT ONE PERSON. HE CAN PUT 10,000 TO FLIGHT WITH THAT ONE PERSON. NOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM HAS ACTUALLY EXED IT UP AGAIN. NOW, IT'S NOT TWO CHASING 10,000. IT'S ONE. SEE, WITH ONE PERSON IN GENUINE FAITH, HE CAN PUT 10,000 DEVILS RUNNING AS HARD AS THEY CAN GO. I'D LIKE TO BE THAT PERSON. OH, I'D [screaming] LIKE TO BE THAT PERSON. HAVE 10,000 DEVILS RUNNING AWAY FROM ME AS HARD AS THEY CAN GO. &gt;&gt; QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. OH MY. PRAYER FROM A SAINT WILL GO A MILLION TIMES HIGHER THAN AN ANGEL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT THAT. THE PRAYER FROM ONE SAINT WILL GO A MILLION TIMES HIGHER THAN AN ANGEL BECAUSE HE'S A SON. YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD PREDESTINATED US. NOW WATCH UH JUST A MINUTE. ACCORDING HE'S GOING TO READ EPHESIANS. ACCORDING AS HE HATH CHOSEN US IN HIM. I love it. You ready? Now we didn't choose. See how could I choose him? Here we go. 400 BILLION MILLION BILLION TRILLION YEARS AGO. &gt;&gt; That's a lot. I like to see that zero is wrote out. 400 BILLION MILLION BILLION TRILLION YEARS AGO. How could I have chosen him? But he chose me. &gt;&gt; CHOSEN US IN HIM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD THAT WE should be holy. Now don't try to make yourself because you can't AND WITHOUT HIM WITHOUT BLAME BEFORE HIM IN LOVE. YOU CAN SEE WHY THE WORKS OF THE FLESH HAVE ALMOST NO VALUE OF YOU TRYING TO USE YOUR OWN HUMAN WILL through gritted teeth THROUGH CHRISTIAN PSYCHOLOGY THROUGH DISCIPLINE OR LIVING IN A MONASTERY OR MEMORIZING SCRIPTURE VERSES UH BECOME A WALKING QUOTE MACHINE. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU CAN'T MAKE YOURSELF PERFECT. HE HAS ALREADY JUDGED YOU PERFECT HAS ALREADY JOINED YOU TOGETHER TO HIM IN LOVE. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? SO WHEN IT COMES TO GOD'S FAMILY MEMBERS, THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF HIS KINGDOM, remember he REMEMBER HE CAN'T RESPECT PERSONS. HE'S NO RESPECTOR OF PERSONS. &gt;&gt; BUT YET WE JUST READ HE TOLD ISRAEL, I WILL RESPECT YOU AND SHOW YOU FAVOR. BECAUSE NO RESPECTOR OF PERSONS, IT MEANS THAT INSIDE THE FAMILY OF GOD, IF HE EVER HAD, IF MOSES EVER DID SOMETHING AND GOT GOD'S FAVOR AND I DID THE SAME THING, I'M IN THE FAMILY WITH MOSES. I CAN GET HIS FAVOR. BUT NEVER MAKE A MISTAKE OF BELIEVING THAT GOD DOESN'T FAVOR YOU, HIS ELECT, JEAN, HIS FAMILY, THE APPLE OF [screaming] HIS EYE. HE MOST CERTAINLY DOES FAVOR YOU. AND IT'S NOT UNFAIR TO THE WORLD. BUT YOU CAME FROM HIM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. 400 BILLION MILLION BILLION TRILLION YEARS AGO. YOU WERE ALREADY IN HIM AND ALREADY PERFECT. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO THAT IT'S NOT ONE TO ONE. I'M LITERALLY LIVING IN A REALITY. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE CALL THIS THE RA THE THE THE THE THE THE RACE OF LIFE. YOU KNOW, PAUL TALKS ABOUT WE'RE IN A RACE AND MANY run but ONE WINS THE PRIZE. REMEMBER THAT. SO, SO NOW WHEN I REALIZE THAT I'M LIVING IN A in a reality OF 400 BILLION MILLION, BILLION TRILLION MILES AHEAD of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And my life's journey. &gt;&gt; That's how far ahead of him &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; What am I trying to say to you this morning? Make up your mind to serve God today. Amen. &gt;&gt; And once you give him control of all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength, you yet you stumble &gt;&gt; out of THE GATE. &gt;&gt; TOMORROW, &gt;&gt; TODAY YOU'RE GIVING HIM YOUR WHOLE MIND, YOUR WHOLE HEART, YOUR WHOLE UNDERSTANDING, YOUR WHOLE STRENGTH, YOUR WHOLE EVERYTHING. BUT IF TOMORROW YOU STUMBLE COMING OUT OF THE GATE, JUST REMEMBER YOU'RE STILL 400 BILLION MILLION BILLION TRILLION MILES AHEAD OF THE DEVIL. AND ALL I HAVE TO DO IS GET DOWN AND BOW MY HEAD AND BOW MY HEART AND BOW MY KNEE AND REPENT AND I STAND BACK UP. [screaming] I DON'T GO BACK TO ZERO. I'M STILL 400 BILLION MILLION BILLION TRILLION MILES [screaming] &gt;&gt; AHEAD OF THE DEVIL. THE VICTORY YOU SECURE TODAY WILL BE YOUR VICTORY TOMORROW AND NEXT WEEK AND NEXT MONTH AND NEXT YEAR. HOW MANY PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE THAT KIND OF VICTORY? &gt;&gt; STAND UP WITH ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF THAT'S A REAL DESIRE OF YOUR HEART TO HAVE THAT KIND OF VICTORY in your life, &gt;&gt; then here's here's your remedy. See, here's your remedy right from our text. Thou shalt love the Lord God with all your heart. How many are willing? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All your soul, &gt;&gt; all your mind, all your strength, all your understanding, &gt;&gt; no matter what the word is challenging you to today. Let's bow our heads all over the building. I have not spent the last 80 minutes preaching to you out of a sorcery book. This isn't hocus pocus. This is a real power [music] that's real and effective. And if you are standing there today and you're willing to say, "Lord God, I give you all my heart. I give you all my soul. I give you all my mind. I give you all my strength." You might not be willing, but if you are, why don't you raise up those hands to God and say, "Lord, all of me. I'm raising up both of mine. I want a fresh surrender today. Lord, I'm glad, Father. I'm so glad. Boy, am I ever glad that your kingdom's [music] not one to one. And I'm sure glad you multiply. Oh God, if I think about the years that I spent, how many years it would have taken you to clean me up. Oh my goodness, [music] how much time would have been wasted. But you cleaned me in a moment. You filled me with your life. [music] You put me on the path. You put me into service even before I was even felt ready to be put into service because that's how you roll. You you take your servants, you put them on, you go ahead and stick them in service, and then you finish up their training on the job. I've been training for a long time, Lord. I still feel like a student, but I want to know you and your power and your resurrection. [music] I I trust that this word today goes out across this building and across the airwaves to hearts and minds of your people who will say, "Lord, I've got to win the battle of my soul. And then I want to win the battle of my mind. I want to give you [clears throat] my whole heart and all my strength [music] and all my objectives and all my determinations. I'm looking ahead down the path. I don't see how in the world I'll pull it off, but I'm offering [music] it to you now. And I'm asking you to make the effective changes in my life. Is that your desire today? You don't have to have all the answers, friends. You don't have to figure it all out. You just want to raise up a hand and say, "God, have mercy on me. &gt;&gt; Look down in my life and figure it out for me, LORD. PUT ME ON your path. I can't fix what's behind me, BUT I CAN GO FORWARD in victory. I commit myself a new to you, master. I trust that this word has been a [music] benefit to your people. I've delivered it for sure. For sure according to the dictates of my heart, what I felt [music] honest and that's the truth. My faith is perfect in everything that was said today and I give it to you now to [music] the Holy Ghost in Jesus name. Amen. Let's sing before we go. Have a little worship. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I surrender. &gt;&gt; The lighter my load, &gt;&gt; the lighter [music] my Lord, the more that I release [music] my cares, the more he takes [singing] control. Oh, the more [music] that I can offer myself, the more [singing] he lifts [music] me up. &gt;&gt; So every day &gt;&gt; and every day I live. &gt;&gt; Every day, [music] &gt;&gt; Lord, I love [singing] &gt;&gt; more than I surrender. Come on, let's sing it. &gt;&gt; More than I surrender. [music] More [singing] than I surrender. singer [music] my Lord. The more the more the more [music] that I [singing] release my tears, the more [music] retain control. the [singing] more that I can &gt;&gt; to every word humble to every word [music] lift me up and every [music and singing] day I live &gt;&gt; I love &gt;&gt; I want you to listen to [music] some of these verses now give us some verses brother Tom think about these anointed words &gt;&gt; and it gets [music] easier to understand the road I'm [music] traveling down. &gt;&gt; Oh, Sister Brenda wrote those words. &gt;&gt; No more wondering. &gt;&gt; This is a veteran sister. [music] &gt;&gt; She knew what it meant to fight for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Standing on. &gt;&gt; She knew what it meant to have victory. &gt;&gt; Now I know to my [music] future home. &gt;&gt; The voice, &gt;&gt; the voice I [singing] hear is yours. Every [music] day I live, &gt;&gt; I Lord I love [music] more. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's give him a wave offering now. The more that I surrender, [music] the [singing] more that I surrender, the lighter [music] [singing] my Lord. Think about it.
