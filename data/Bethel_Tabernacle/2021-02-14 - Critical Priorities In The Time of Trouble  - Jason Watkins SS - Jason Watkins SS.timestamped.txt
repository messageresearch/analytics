[5:46] good morning let's stand
[5:52] we're going to look at philippians this
[5:54] morning
[5:58] paul with some very profound teaching to
[6:01] the church
[6:02] i want to go in the third chapter
[6:05] amen one of my most
[6:09] marked up places in my bible i've got so
[6:12] many
[6:13] uh colors and little notations and i
[6:16] look back on the man i wrote that
[6:17] 25 years ago but just meant a lot to me
[6:21] it always has
[6:23] this position that paul takes here we
[6:26] want to read from chapter
[6:27] 3 and we want to begin at verse
[6:32] 7. philippians 3
[6:38] and 7. but what things were gained to me
[6:43] those i counted loss for christ
[6:47] yea doubtless and i count all things but
[6:50] loss
[6:51] all things catch it all things but loss
[6:54] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[6:58] jesus of christ jesus my lord
[7:01] for whom i have suffered the loss of all
[7:04] things
[7:05] and do count them but dung here's why
[7:08] that i may win christ and
[7:12] be found in him not
[7:15] having mine own righteousness which is
[7:18] of the law
[7:19] but that which is through the faith of
[7:21] christ
[7:22] the righteousness which is of god by
[7:26] faith i love this i love this verse 10
[7:29] that i may know him and the power
[7:33] of his resurrection look at all these
[7:36] ends
[7:36] that i may know him it's one and the
[7:39] power of his resurrections
[7:41] too and the fellowship of his sufferings
[7:45] here's why being made conformable
[7:48] unto his death so that if by any means
[7:52] i might attain unto the resurrection
[7:56] of the dead not as though
[7:59] i had already attained either were
[8:02] already perfect
[8:03] but i follow after if that i may
[8:06] apprehend that
[8:08] for which also i am apprehended
[8:11] of christ jesus brethren i count not
[8:14] myself to have apprehended
[8:17] but this one thing i do forgetting
[8:20] those things which are behind and
[8:23] reaching forth
[8:24] unto those things which are before i
[8:28] press
[8:28] i stretch i reach i strain
[8:32] toward the mark for the prize of the
[8:36] high calling
[8:37] of god in christ
[8:41] let us therefore as many as be perfect
[8:44] be thus minded
[8:45] and if in anything you be otherwise
[8:48] minded
[8:48] god shall reveal even this to you
[8:52] let's go to the lord in prayer
[8:55] father we thank you lord for your word
[8:58] to us
[8:59] that just in the reading we're taught in
[9:01] the bible that just
[9:02] reading the word of god there's a
[9:05] blessing in just
[9:06] reading it so i commit it now to you
[9:09] lord
[9:10] and father ask you to help us now in
[9:12] this
[9:13] in this sunday school class we commit it
[9:15] to you in jesus name
[9:17] amen praise the lord god bless you you
[9:20] can be seated
[9:30] paul here is challenging us
[9:33] and i i wanted to
[9:36] speak to you today about priorities
[9:39] and i sent forth my title uh priorities
[9:43] especially as it relates to the time
[9:47] and the hour that we are faced with
[9:50] and here's something that you're going
[9:53] to want to get your mind around very
[9:55] quickly
[9:56] what you're faced with you can't escape
[9:58] it
[9:59] it's not like there's somewhere you can
[10:01] go where it's not going to be
[10:03] though perilous times are here
[10:07] and men are lovers of pleasure more than
[10:10] lovers of god that's not going to change
[10:13] they are truth breakers and false
[10:14] accusers they are incontinent and fierce
[10:17] and they despise
[10:19] those who are good that's not going away
[10:22] you can't pray it away and i'll tell you
[10:25] something else friends let me let me
[10:26] while i'm on that vein
[10:28] you know paul here talking about how
[10:32] that that he says he says brethren i
[10:35] count not myself to have apprehended but
[10:38] this one thing i do forgetting those
[10:40] things which are behind and i'm reaching
[10:42] so so paul is actually
[10:45] has a plan to be an overcomer because
[10:48] that's what he's asked i want to know
[10:50] him
[10:50] i don't just want to know about him i
[10:52] actually want to know him in the power
[10:53] of his resurrection
[10:55] now there's no way first of all you'll
[10:57] never know him never
[10:59] never never will you know him in the
[11:01] power of his resurrection
[11:03] unless you're willing to go with him to
[11:04] calvary
[11:06] unless you're willing to die to you die
[11:08] to self
[11:09] and be born again of him there's no way
[11:12] to know him in the power of his
[11:13] resurrection
[11:14] but now watch what paul says here in
[11:17] verse 12. give me verse 12 brother kevin
[11:20] not as though i had already attained
[11:22] either were already perfect
[11:24] but watch this i follow after if that i
[11:27] may
[11:28] apprehend in other words this thing
[11:31] isn't
[11:31] i don't get rubber stamped as an
[11:34] overcoming believer
[11:36] that's not a rubber stamp from god that
[11:39] paul is saying i've got an
[11:40] opportunity to be an overcomer i'm
[11:43] always going to be a son of god that's
[11:45] not going to change i wasn't
[11:47] i didn't remember we were speaking
[11:49] wednesday night
[11:50] how that brother branham made it so
[11:51] clear you're not a christian because you
[11:53] desired to be
[11:54] you're a christian because god desired
[11:56] you to be now that's beautiful
[11:58] that's never going to change i can never
[12:00] nothing paul this is the same paul
[12:03] who taught us that nothing can separate
[12:06] me from the love of god
[12:08] there's height or depth famine peril
[12:11] sword
[12:11] uh and paul goes on to teach there how
[12:14] that even he himself
[12:16] couldn't separate himself i can't
[12:19] separate me from god
[12:20] but that that's not what we're talking
[12:22] about today we're talking
[12:24] about getting a prize pressing toward a
[12:27] mark
[12:28] there's a higher calling than just being
[12:32] a ground-running
[12:33] believer you're supposed to be a
[12:36] heavenly
[12:36] creature soaring in the heavenlies
[12:39] because god has you here for his purpose
[12:42] is not
[12:43] yours and there's where priorities come
[12:46] down our priorities really need to be
[12:49] his purposes lord why do you have me
[12:51] here and what is important to you
[12:54] that operates in my life god doesn't
[12:57] mind you making plans
[12:59] god doesn't mind you getting an
[13:01] education having a career
[13:03] having a purpose having a vision going
[13:06] forward
[13:06] accomplishing things doing things having
[13:09] things
[13:10] nothing in the world wrong with that
[13:12] that's the nature because you're
[13:13] you're like that because you're built in
[13:15] the image of god
[13:16] and so that that that kind of thing runs
[13:19] down all the way even instinctually
[13:21] through the lower creatures you see ants
[13:23] always busy
[13:24] because that's in their nature they know
[13:26] if i'm gonna live i better be on the
[13:28] move
[13:28] and so we find that that that that
[13:32] that's not the problem the problem is is
[13:35] what happens when our life
[13:37] runs afoul of his vision for my life
[13:42] now we have to ask ourselves about
[13:44] priority
[13:45] it's not paul's not talking here about
[13:47] getting born again he's already dealt
[13:49] with that
[13:50] about being born he's already preached
[13:51] that he's talking about reaching
[13:54] spiritual maturity
[13:56] he's talking about he calls it
[13:57] perfection it doesn't mean sinless
[13:59] flawlessness where you never make a
[14:00] mistake
[14:01] you'll have that until the body change
[14:03] but he's talking about
[14:04] spiritual maturity because remember
[14:06] friends that the
[14:08] that the quest that you are on did you
[14:10] know your own one
[14:11] you're on a journey god told israel this
[14:13] is where israel failed in the wilderness
[14:16] you know they they had all these rituals
[14:17] and all this and that and and they just
[14:19] thought you know
[14:20] we got to have church and we got to have
[14:21] a tent we got to keep a law
[14:23] and god said i you were just on a
[14:25] journey
[14:27] you were that's what you were missing i
[14:28] sent you on a journey i know you thought
[14:30] it was all this other extraneous stuff
[14:33] but that was just me responding to you
[14:35] and trying to keep you in line
[14:37] but i sent you on a journey to to come
[14:40] to a place
[14:41] that i promised your father abraham
[14:44] and many of them paul said never made it
[14:47] many of them
[14:48] who left under the exodus who crossed
[14:51] through the red sea
[14:53] who ate manna from heaven never made it
[14:56] to the fulfillment of what
[14:58] god promised abraham's seed because they
[15:01] didn't mingle it with faith
[15:02] you know when when you this is where
[15:04] paul is making a distinction
[15:07] to say listen i've already lived my life
[15:10] i already acquired and achieved more
[15:13] than you
[15:14] people who are reading my letter i was a
[15:16] pharisee of the pharisees i was first in
[15:18] my class
[15:19] i was extremely highly educated i was
[15:22] above
[15:23] my fellows and above my peers and i was
[15:25] being fast-tracked
[15:27] to the top so go ahead
[15:30] run like crazy to get what you think are
[15:32] your correct priorities i'm here to tell
[15:34] you
[15:35] i've been there i've done that i got the
[15:37] t-shirt it ain't worth it amen
[15:40] what i want to tell you now is the
[15:42] greatest thing you can press for
[15:44] the greatest thing you need to adjust
[15:46] your priorities to
[15:48] is that you may know him and in the
[15:50] power of his resurrection
[15:52] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[15:54] because we don't reign with him unless
[15:55] we suffer with him
[15:57] and too often times we are adjusting our
[16:00] priorities
[16:02] according to what we want and we don't
[16:04] even bother to consider
[16:06] god's priorities we prioritize our life
[16:10] and it's almost
[16:11] always upside down if left to our own
[16:14] devices
[16:16] in other words if left uninstructed by
[16:19] the word
[16:20] your flesh will always look out for
[16:22] number one you have to press
[16:25] towards the mark you're flushing and
[16:27] like that you have to strain
[16:29] paul says i'm stretching i'm
[16:32] reaching i might even i'm almost
[16:35] catching a cramp
[16:36] because i'm reaching so hard for it go
[16:38] ahead
[16:39] go ahead that'll do you good now you
[16:42] know what that cramping is
[16:43] is you entering into the fellowship of
[16:45] his sufferings because he's stretched
[16:47] he reached all the way out till he
[16:49] stretched himself out on a cross
[16:51] for you and i you know there's a a very
[16:55] famous story you've likely heard it it's
[16:57] a professor i don't know the precise
[17:00] history on it but
[17:02] you can see it many times and it's it's
[17:04] it deals with priorities
[17:06] and a um um a social sciences
[17:11] professor i believe is what he was who
[17:13] was instructing
[17:15] at a university and he wanted to
[17:17] instruct
[17:18] his students in the in the about
[17:22] priorities
[17:23] for life and he said and and they said
[17:26] that he he literally brought in
[17:28] a big empty mayonnaise jar and
[17:31] over here he had some pretty good sized
[17:34] fist-sized rocks
[17:36] and over here he had some little pebbles
[17:38] and over here he had some sand
[17:41] and he first takes all those big rocks
[17:43] and he starts putting them down in the
[17:44] jar
[17:45] and he says he says let me let me get
[17:47] that in see if i can get all these in
[17:48] here
[17:49] and he kept putting them in there and
[17:50] suddenly he got to the top and he still
[17:52] had several
[17:53] but they he tried to go there was no way
[17:55] to get the lid on he said well i guess
[17:57] it's full
[17:57] and everybody's like yup it's full you
[17:59] can't get any more in there
[18:01] he goes it's full they said oh yeah it's
[18:03] full
[18:04] you're sure oh yeah it's full until he
[18:07] reached and got the little small pebbles
[18:09] and then he started pouring them in and
[18:11] giving it a little shake
[18:12] and they trickled all the way down
[18:14] through all the gaps and filled up all
[18:15] the gaps
[18:16] and everybody caught it said ah well
[18:19] okay
[18:20] now it's full really you're sure it's
[18:22] full oh yes it's full
[18:23] and then he got the sand and then he
[18:26] started pouring the sand in and give it
[18:27] a shake
[18:28] and the sand worked in between all the
[18:30] pebbles and finally he got it to the
[18:32] end but he he holds up all of his
[18:36] things here and they've all he's got big
[18:39] rocks that didn't get to go in
[18:40] pebbles that didn't get to make it
[18:42] they'd sand that didn't make the cut
[18:44] and he says now watch this he says this
[18:48] mayonnaise jar
[18:49] is your life this manny's jar is your
[18:52] life
[18:53] he said the big rocks are the big
[18:56] important things in your life
[18:57] like god like family like relationships
[19:01] you understand these are the big rocks
[19:04] and he said
[19:05] he said now watch watch watch what
[19:07] happens to me
[19:08] he said now as long as i put them in
[19:11] then i can put the pebbles in
[19:13] then i can put the sand in but now watch
[19:15] this he takes it all back out
[19:17] and he puts then he he's going to put
[19:20] the sand in
[19:22] and then he's going to put the pebbles
[19:23] on top of that and now he's doing it in
[19:25] reverse
[19:26] and he's showing that the problem with
[19:30] people he said
[19:31] the big rocks are the really important
[19:33] things the pebbles
[19:34] are your career your job you know
[19:38] things like that the sand is just your
[19:40] stuff your recreational things your toys
[19:43] your your games your your vacations and
[19:46] he said
[19:47] a lot of times people put that in first
[19:50] and then they put the next thing in
[19:51] first and then they got nowhere to get
[19:53] all the stones
[19:55] all the big things that are important to
[19:57] life he said those should go into the
[19:59] jar
[19:59] first see and so it so if if you have
[20:04] your life many times and his whole
[20:05] lesson
[20:06] was you know prioritize your life
[20:09] put the important things in first if you
[20:11] don't you won't be able to
[20:13] fit them in your life you have lots of
[20:16] stuff in toys and games
[20:18] but you won't have important things you
[20:20] won't have the things that really matter
[20:22] and your family will get neglected your
[20:24] soul will get neglected god will get
[20:26] neglected
[20:27] why because your priorities are upside
[20:31] down amen you understand you get that i
[20:33] know you can
[20:34] can get that image in your mind and so a
[20:38] lot of times you know when
[20:40] when we see things happening in the
[20:42] world
[20:43] you know no one has a problem
[20:49] saying yeah you know i should probably
[20:52] let god
[20:54] be the ruler of my life i should that's
[20:57] a good idea
[20:57] preacher since he made me and he he sent
[21:01] me an owner's manual
[21:02] and and i i should if i want to be
[21:05] correct and i want eternal life who
[21:06] wouldn't
[21:07] then i should probably let god be you
[21:10] know
[21:10] the co-pilot i like i like what brother
[21:12] richie said at the
[21:14] men's breakfast he said these people run
[21:16] around with this bumper sticker on their
[21:18] car says god is my co-pilot
[21:20] richie said hey if he ain't driving
[21:23] richie ain't riding and so
[21:26] so so it's it's important to let him be
[21:29] to be the pilot of your life he's to be
[21:31] the guide of your life
[21:33] now people don't have a problem
[21:37] with that as a concept what ends up
[21:40] happening and the rub
[21:41] always ends up with once god reveals
[21:45] his direction for their life it don't
[21:48] match their priority list
[21:50] and the things that they want to
[21:51] accomplish you say well if i do that
[21:54] i'll never get to these items on my
[21:56] bucket list
[21:57] i'll never become this or achieve that
[22:00] or own that
[22:02] and and there's where the real problem
[22:04] comes and so because of that
[22:06] when people begin to to discover god's
[22:09] priorities for their life
[22:11] now it's an altogether different thing
[22:13] and you know it
[22:14] i mean even even in life when people
[22:18] when people suffer and things go wrong
[22:21] in their life and you know as a preacher
[22:24] here i am trying to tell them to say
[22:26] you know god is in control of mankind
[22:30] the bible says he leads
[22:31] kings around but like like a a ring puts
[22:34] a ring in their nose and leads them
[22:36] and you start preaching about this
[22:37] sovereign god who's in control of
[22:39] everything big and small
[22:41] and here you've got a person with almost
[22:43] an unspeakable tragedy and they're going
[22:45] really and this is the guy you want me
[22:47] to serve
[22:48] and he let this happen in my life and
[22:51] you tell him he's in control
[22:53] you know and and and there's there's
[22:55] things that happen
[22:56] to you and i yeah in our lives
[23:00] and it creates a question and and i'm
[23:02] here to i'm just be honest with you
[23:04] sometimes your life i've had it happen
[23:06] in my life
[23:07] something happens in my life that
[23:09] produces a question and the and the
[23:11] question
[23:12] that has plagued mankind for since the
[23:14] dawn of time is a three-letter word why
[23:18] kids start asking it before that's one
[23:20] of the first words they learn they want
[23:22] to know why
[23:23] you can't have it why and so so it's
[23:26] it's natural in man
[23:28] to ask a question and sometimes the
[23:31] answer to the why
[23:33] of whatever has happened in your life
[23:34] wherever you came from wherever you got
[23:36] here
[23:36] whatever you went through you know i
[23:39] could just say
[23:40] that was then this is now but why
[23:41] preacher well it might be
[23:44] now maybe i can give you an answer in
[23:45] the bible but it might be
[23:48] that the answer you're looking for is on
[23:50] the other side
[23:51] and you might never fully get it on this
[23:54] side but that
[23:55] misses the whole point i can promise you
[23:57] this
[23:58] if you'll just let god be the lord of
[24:01] your life
[24:02] it doesn't matter what happens to you in
[24:05] the long run
[24:07] if you're willing to to prioritize
[24:11] god's will for your life you may miss
[24:13] out on things
[24:14] you may you may lose things you may have
[24:17] to watch your
[24:18] peers accelerate past you and rise above
[24:22] you
[24:23] you know i remember that i remember that
[24:25] very well i remember as a young man
[24:27] and and my wife and i had children very
[24:30] early and
[24:31] we believed very strongly in her being a
[24:33] mommy at home because i've always said
[24:35] there's i heard it said 40 years ago in
[24:38] a sermon i've never forgot it
[24:39] and ministers said there i can tell you
[24:42] sisters
[24:43] there is no substitute for a child
[24:46] coming in from school and bursting into
[24:48] the door and saying
[24:50] mom and be have a mother there to greet
[24:53] him
[24:54] and he said i get hard times calls
[24:56] things and i get sometimes things happen
[24:58] but there's no substitute for that
[25:01] mother you can substitute it but you're
[25:03] not going to find anything
[25:04] equal to a mother there to greet him and
[25:07] we made that decision and we every
[25:10] everybody we grew up with all of our
[25:12] peers all of the
[25:14] the gang that we ran around with as
[25:16] teenagers
[25:17] and they all got married and debbie and
[25:19] i got married
[25:20] and you know what i i had to often times
[25:23] sit back
[25:24] and watch some of them even younger than
[25:26] me go past me
[25:28] financially you know and in every way
[25:30] buying fine homes buying cars and here
[25:32] we are
[25:33] you know buying old jalopies and and i i
[25:36] know what it is friends i
[25:37] you know i i might like to drive a nice
[25:40] truck now but listen brother jason
[25:41] understands what it is
[25:43] to need to go to walmart you got to put
[25:44] a quart of oil in the car to get there
[25:47] and a quart of oil back in the car to
[25:49] get home again i understand what that's
[25:50] about
[25:51] and and and and but yet i wanted her
[25:54] there i wanted a mother there to raise
[25:56] the children i have no
[25:58] regrets of that to this day and
[26:01] you know i i set a priority to where now
[26:04] i see many of those in fact nearly every
[26:07] last single solitary one of them
[26:09] so in some cases marriages are broke up
[26:12] in other cases their kids are blown into
[26:14] the world in other cases they're now
[26:16] financially ruined
[26:18] and here i am with my family serving god
[26:21] and
[26:21] my health and i'm comfortable
[26:23] financially and
[26:24] and god has blessed me why because i put
[26:26] the right priority
[26:28] in decades ago and i maintained it
[26:32] and i did what i had to do i worked say
[26:34] you ever worked two jobs i've worked
[26:36] three
[26:38] brother brahms said the son of god's
[26:39] only one that will work i've worked
[26:41] three jobs
[26:42] at one time before going in the morning
[26:45] to do one
[26:46] go to another one to do another one and
[26:47] then head to another another one late at
[26:49] night
[26:49] and get up the next morning and do it
[26:51] again but i in
[26:53] all of that i can say that i i am so
[26:56] glad today
[26:58] not because that now i don't have to
[27:00] drive a jalopy
[27:02] but because now i have because i set the
[27:04] priorities for family
[27:06] i put the big rocks in first and now
[27:09] i've got
[27:10] sons that love me and love their mom and
[27:12] love each other and love their wives and
[27:14] love their children
[27:15] and i've i've been able to create that
[27:18] sometimes friends families don't come up
[27:21] that way
[27:22] and it becomes incumbent upon you and i
[27:24] to break a cycle
[27:26] and i just want to tell you something if
[27:27] you don't come from a stable environment
[27:29] of love like i did say
[27:30] my home was broken and this happened
[27:32] well break the cycle
[27:35] set a new priority cause and and if
[27:38] you've been blessed enough
[27:40] to come from a home of love like that
[27:43] pass it on will you because the world is
[27:46] dying for
[27:47] some good examples of priorities
[27:51] and so we find then that that you know
[27:54] uh god looks down upon our lives and
[27:58] you know when we recognize that god is
[28:01] in control
[28:03] over everything uh you know it's hard
[28:06] sometimes
[28:07] i've seen people do it it's hard
[28:10] sometimes not to blame god but
[28:12] remember i want to give you this point
[28:13] before i close i've seen people do that
[28:16] david speaks to us uh in psalm 16. can
[28:20] you find that brother kevin psalm 16 11.
[28:22] i got just a about two minutes of
[28:24] regulation
[28:25] and i'll try not to go into the overtime
[28:28] psalm 16 11
[28:30] thou wilt show me the path of life now
[28:32] look at this
[28:34] in thy presence is fullness of joy
[28:37] at thy right hand there are pleasures
[28:41] forever more so a lot of times friend
[28:46] it's it's joy comes to those who wait
[28:49] on the lord you're going to want to be
[28:52] in his presence you're going to want to
[28:53] spend time in his presence because i'm
[28:56] here to tell you
[28:57] it ain't a fancy house or a nicer car
[29:00] or more recreation that's not gonna
[29:04] bring you
[29:04] joy that can bring you pleasure
[29:09] but that's not joy that's not peace you
[29:12] understand that's not contentment that's
[29:14] not satisfaction
[29:17] joy the real joy comes
[29:20] in in the presence is the fullness
[29:23] of joy living your life prioritizing
[29:27] your life
[29:28] here at the end time to
[29:31] to not just spend time in the presence
[29:35] of the lord

[29:39] presence of the lord
