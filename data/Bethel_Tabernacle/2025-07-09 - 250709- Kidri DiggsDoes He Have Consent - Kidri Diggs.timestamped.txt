[27:21] you have a unspoken request, you can
[27:23] acknowledge it to the Lord by uplifted
[27:25] hand. Amen. Let's pray. Lord Jesus,
[27:28] Father God, we Lord for giving us the
[27:31] praise for the garment of heaviness,
[27:34] Lord. And Lord, there are things going
[27:37] on in this world, but we're just happy
[27:40] to be in the land of the living, Lord.
[27:43] Lord God, we know where our help comes
[27:45] from, Lord. And we know that your arm is
[27:47] never short, Lord. Lord, and whatever
[27:49] you do, you do it to its fullness, Lord.
[27:52] All we have to do is wait on you, Lord,
[27:55] and look for your leadership and your
[27:58] guidance, Lord, and not move according
[28:00] to our own feelings, but we want to be
[28:02] in your perfect will. And Lord, we just
[28:05] pray tonight, Lord, that the Holy Spirit
[28:07] will guide and lead the service, Lord,
[28:09] as if it's already done in the worship,
[28:12] Lord. But now the word is coming forth.
[28:14] And Lord, we want to yield as speaker,
[28:18] Lord, and yield as hearer, Lord, that
[28:20] we'll only receive of thy spirit. And
[28:24] Lord, we pray the blessing of the
[28:25] kingdom over this church, Lord. the
[28:28] leadership, the governments of the
[28:29] church. Lord, bless the musicians, Lord,
[28:32] and the hands, Lord. Father God, we just
[28:34] pray that the fire will come down upon
[28:36] our altars now. In the wonderful name of
[28:39] Jesus Christ, we pray. Let the church
[28:41] say, "Amen."
[28:42] Amen.
[28:43] Somebody say, "Amen." Again.
[28:45] Amen. If you have your Bibles,
[28:49] let's turn to uh St. John chapter 5.
[28:54] St. John chapter 5.
[29:06] St. John
[29:08] chapter 5.
[29:16] Let's just start reading at verse one.
[29:19] The Bible says after this there was a
[29:22] feast of the Jews
[29:25] and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now
[29:29] there is at Jerusalem by the sheep
[29:32] market a pool which is called in Hebrew
[29:35] tongue Bethesda having five porches. In
[29:39] these lay a great multitude of impotent
[29:42] folk of blind halt withered waiting for
[29:46] the moving of the water. Amen.
[29:49] For an angel went down at a certain
[29:51] season into the pool and troubled the
[29:54] waters. Whosoever then first after the
[29:58] troubling of the waters stepped in was
[30:01] made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
[30:06] And a certain man was there which had an
[30:09] infirmity 38 years. When Jesus saw him,
[30:14] when Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he
[30:17] had been now a long time in that case,
[30:20] he saith unto him, "Will thou be made
[30:24] whole?" Amen. Hebrews
[30:28] chapter 11.
[30:42] Let's just read one verse out of here.
[30:44] Let's go to verse six.
[30:46] But without faith, it is impossible to
[30:48] please him. For he that cometh to God
[30:52] must first believe that he is, and that
[30:55] he is a rewarder of them that diligently
[30:59] seek him. Amen. May the Lord have
[31:01] blessed the reading of his word. You can
[31:04] have your seats
[31:08] if you don't mind.
[31:11] just to
[31:14] capture just to capture the the stage of
[31:18] the thought I want to deal with tonight.
[31:19] Let's turn to Job the first chapter. Job
[31:23] chapter 1.
[31:29] Job chapter 1.
[31:33] Let's start reading at verse six.
[31:39] Now the Bible says, "Now there was a day
[31:41] when the sons of God came to present
[31:43] themselves before the Lord and Satan
[31:46] came also among them."
[31:49] Satan like coming to church.
[31:53] Let me say this. The presence of God and
[31:57] who God is is nothing strange to the
[32:01] devil.
[32:02] He knows who God is
[32:04] and he knows what God's presence is.
[32:08] I'll take it a step further. He knows
[32:10] God's voice.
[32:12] Hallelujah.
[32:14] Amen.
[32:14] Amen. It says, "And the Lord said unto
[32:17] Satan, Whence cometh thou?" And Satan
[32:20] answered the Lord and said, "From going
[32:24] to and fro in the earth, and from
[32:26] walking up and down in it." And the Lord
[32:29] said unto Satan, "Hast thou considered
[32:31] my servant Job, that there is none like
[32:35] him in the earth, a perfect and upright
[32:38] man, one that one that fearth God and
[32:42] obscureth evil." My, what if God would
[32:46] testify about your life like that
[32:48] tonight?
[32:49] The enemy is coming with all his
[32:51] shenanigans and what he want to do and
[32:53] God say, "Hold up. I got somebody
[32:55] perfect.
[32:56] I got somebody that can stand the test
[32:59] of time. He He It's evil all over the
[33:02] place, but he going to shun it.
[33:04] Hallelujah. What What What would God be
[33:07] saying about you if the devil was
[33:09] approaching him saying, "Hey, can I have
[33:12] that person?
[33:13] Would God be able to testify about your
[33:15] life like that?" Amen.
[33:18] My is that isn't that powerful? But
[33:20] listen to Satan. Did Satan answered
[33:24] the Lord and said, "Do Job fear God for
[33:27] not? Hast thou made hast thou made an
[33:32] hedge about him and about his house and
[33:35] all that he hath on every side? Thou
[33:38] hast blessed the works of his hands, and
[33:41] his substance is increased in the land."
[33:45] Now God didn't testify. Now the devil's
[33:48] going to testify.
[33:50] Oh. Oh my. Oh my. The devil's going to
[33:53] say back to God, I see the same thing
[33:56] you see.
[33:57] But yet I can't touch him.
[34:01] My my subject tonight is does he have
[34:05] consent?
[34:07] Does he have consent? Hallelujah. And
[34:11] what I want to I want to the reason why
[34:13] I read this was just to show that the
[34:16] enemy comes to church. He's he's always
[34:18] around our houses, our families. Job
[34:21] named the the devil known he named every
[34:25] area that Job was blessed in.
[34:28] Hallelujah. He talked about his
[34:30] finances. He talked about his house. He
[34:33] talked about his health. In every area,
[34:35] the devil was saying, "I can't touch
[34:37] him."
[34:39] He said, "There's a hedge about him."
[34:41] What was he saying? I don't have
[34:42] consent.
[34:45] Hallelujah. Oh my I I I I I want to get
[34:50] to him. I You've blessed his hands.
[34:52] You've blessed everything. But you got a
[34:55] hedge about him. Hallelujah.
[34:57] Oh my. Consent, church. Oh my. If if
[35:01] just to narrow it down, let me let me
[35:02] read a a definition of consent. Now,
[35:05] we've heard this word before. Consent.
[35:08] Now, the reason why I I put this in the
[35:10] form of a question is, does he have
[35:13] consent? Because there are only two
[35:15] spirits we can operate under tonight.
[35:18] Amen.
[35:18] You either operating under the spirit of
[35:21] fear or the spirit of faith.
[35:23] And the enemy, he holds fear.
[35:26] And God holds faith. Hallelujah.
[35:28] You say, "Well, we are to fear God." No,
[35:30] that's reverence.
[35:32] Hallelujah. I'm not per se, oh, God
[35:35] going to get me. I'm afraid. No. No.
[35:37] Uh-uh. Uh-uh. I know he loves me.
[35:40] Hallelujah. So whatever I do,
[35:42] hallelujah, concerning the things of
[35:43] God, of course I don't want to mess up,
[35:46] but that's not fear that he's going to
[35:48] kill me. That's fear that I'm going to
[35:49] disappoint him.
[35:51] Hallelujah. So it's therefore a
[35:53] reverence versus me being afraid to go
[35:56] to hell. But church, we there are two
[35:58] things we operate under. You either
[36:00] operating under fear or faith.
[36:03] Hallelujah. And the prophet of God said
[36:06] doubt is accompanied by fear. So if you
[36:09] got any doubt today, you got any doubt
[36:12] in this room, fear is also walking with
[36:14] you.
[36:16] Hallelujah.
[36:17] So what's accompanied by faith? Love,
[36:19] power, sound mind, the things of God.
[36:23] But if we look at the definition of
[36:25] consent, consent means to permit,
[36:29] approve or agree. Amen. Now, when it
[36:33] comes to the spirit world and the two
[36:35] spirits we deal with, you have to ask
[36:37] yourself tonight, have I given the devil
[36:40] consent?
[36:44] Have I permitted him to do certain
[36:47] things in my life?
[36:49] He cannot do it without permission.
[36:54] So, if you're depressed or you're
[36:56] fighting a spirit of depression, you had
[36:58] to give him consent.
[37:02] You say, "Well, I went to the world and
[37:04] I messed up my life." You had to give
[37:07] the enemy consent.
[37:09] Because he can only do what's allowed.
[37:13] He doesn't have power to just jump on us
[37:16] and wreck our life. No,
[37:19] he has to get permission from you or
[37:22] God.
[37:25] Notice I didn't just say God. you or God
[37:28] is controlling whatever the enemy is
[37:31] doing. Hallelujah.
[37:36] Everybody all right
[37:40] to permit,
[37:42] approve or agree. Hallelujah. Now look
[37:45] here. Right here in this moment when God
[37:48] is talking to Satan, Job didn't give him
[37:52] permission.
[37:54] Job didn't permit it. Job didn't agree
[37:57] with it, but God allowed it. Why? To
[38:00] bring out something greater in his life
[38:02] that he hadn't already known.
[38:05] So, I'll say if God ever allows the
[38:08] enemy to do something in your life, it
[38:11] got to it has to go back to scripture.
[38:14] Hallelujah. If the enemy does anything
[38:16] in your life, if he upsets anything and
[38:19] you know you didn't give him permission,
[38:21] but God allow it is only to make you a
[38:24] better Christian.
[38:28] Hallelujah.
[38:30] The only reason
[38:32] God will let the enemy loose in your
[38:34] life is so that it could work out for
[38:37] your good.
[38:40] Oh my.
[38:42] Well, you think about consent and even
[38:45] for the for the for for the young folks
[38:46] tonight, you say, "Well, consent is I'm
[38:49] still, Brother D, I'm trying to catch
[38:50] it." You know, hallelujah. Oh, I'mma get
[38:53] you good now. You know, when you go out
[38:55] some places and you might uh go to the
[38:58] mall or go out someplace and you ain't
[39:01] got no signal, first thing you try to do
[39:03] is jump on the Wi-Fi.
[39:06] Talk to me now.
[39:08] We try to jump on the Wi-Fi, do
[39:10] something where we can use our phone.
[39:11] Hallelujah. Let's just say tonight,
[39:14] hallelujah. I was in the back room and I
[39:16] had no signal, but Bethl Tabernacle had
[39:19] signal. Hallelujah. And I say, "Okay, I
[39:21] see it. Now, let me get on it before."
[39:25] Hallelujah. I get the service. There's a
[39:28] little box that says, "Do you agree?"
[39:33] Whether it be the airport, whether it be
[39:36] you getting the hotel room. Hallelujah.
[39:39] Before you get the keys, before you get
[39:42] access, you have to check that little
[39:45] box. Give them permission to do what
[39:48] they will with your information.
[39:52] Amen.
[39:56] Let me give you a little tip.
[40:01] Public Wi-Fi is the worst Wi-Fi to get
[40:05] on.
[40:07] Amen.
[40:09] Public Wi-Fi is the Wi-Fi for people
[40:13] that target the information
[40:15] in airports,
[40:18] in malls, all these different places. We
[40:21] jump on the Wi-Fi and we First thing we
[40:23] do though, we hit that box.
[40:26] Agree. Check.
[40:28] You know what happens when you check
[40:30] that box? You're giving them permission
[40:33] to do whatever they will with your
[40:35] information. Yeah.
[40:36] Now they'll tell you this is
[40:38] confidential and we not going to do
[40:39] this. No third party. But how do you
[40:41] know that?
[40:43] Next thing you know, your information on
[40:45] the dark web.
[40:47] Everything been messed up and it ain't
[40:49] nothing you can do about it. Why?
[40:50] Because you gave them consent.
[40:56] Oh my. It's just like you buy a car. You
[40:59] go buy a car. You like the car. You walk
[41:01] around. You drive it. Everything is
[41:03] good. They may have told you, you know,
[41:05] your payment is going to be x amount of
[41:06] dollars. You get in the car, you drive
[41:08] off the lot, and and you didn't read the
[41:11] fine print.
[41:13] The fine print says after you drive this
[41:15] car off the lot, it does not hold its
[41:18] value anymore.
[41:21] So, you may be upset and you say, "Hey,
[41:23] you know what? I'mma take it back." You
[41:25] know what they say? Nope.
[41:27] We don't want it.
[41:29] You didn't gave us consent.
[41:31] It's yours now. You got to keep it.
[41:34] Hallelujah. I wonder how many of us
[41:36] tonight, Hallelujah. Haven't read the
[41:39] fine print
[41:41] when it comes to spiritual things and
[41:43] you've given the devil right to mess up
[41:46] your house,
[41:48] mess up your children,
[41:50] mess up your mind, mess up your body,
[41:53] remember everything I just named, he
[41:56] called back to God in Job's life and
[41:58] said, "I can't touch it.
[42:06] Oh, you say I know some of y'all
[42:09] thinking, "Oh my, we just come through a
[42:12] storm. We got to go through another
[42:14] one."
[42:17] Hallelujah.
[42:19] But we look at it, church, and we look
[42:20] at the word consent.
[42:23] And you know, before I go any further,
[42:27] let's deal with the man at the pool
[42:28] right quick. Everybody all right? Now,
[42:31] this man had an infirmity
[42:33] for 38 years.
[42:35] He was carrying this thing for 38 years.
[42:40] But in him, now now I want you to listen
[42:43] to me real good. Him carrying that
[42:46] sickness for 38 years
[42:49] while at the same time seeing the angel
[42:52] trouble the water.
[42:55] Can you imagine seeing God in your midst
[42:58] and every time you almost there
[43:01] something takes it away from you?
[43:04] Can you imagine? Hallelujah. Coming to
[43:07] Bethl tabernacle and the Holy Ghost
[43:09] fall. Then the devil comes in and say
[43:12] something to you in your mind and deter
[43:14] you from what you're about to receive.
[43:17] And you do that over and over and over
[43:20] and over again. And ain't nothing wrong
[43:22] with the angel. The problem is with the
[43:25] one carrying the sickness.
[43:29] The angel comes faithfully every season
[43:32] and touch the water and this man gathers
[43:35] up his sickness, tries to get there and
[43:37] somebody says,
[43:46] there's a commercial I like. It's on
[43:48] it's on it's on YouTube. It's all over
[43:50] the place.
[43:52] I I think it's State Farm. I can't
[43:54] remember. But it's a old man. And as
[43:57] soon as you get You got to do better
[43:59] than that.
[44:03] Imagine if the enemy had power over your
[44:06] life like that. As soon as you get
[44:09] there, he snatch it away and say, "You
[44:11] got to do better than that,
[44:14] church." Hallelujah. This man carrying
[44:17] this infirmity. I'm sorry, cameraman. I
[44:18] You know me. I I think I supposed to be
[44:20] up here, but you know, I ain't a poor
[44:22] bit preacher.
[44:23] Hallelujah. See, what you fail to
[44:25] realize when I come here, I have
[44:28] consent.
[44:33] Hallelujah.
[44:34] This is one place, hallelujah, I can
[44:37] consider to be home where I didn't get
[44:39] in the pull pit handcuffed.
[44:41] Hallelujah. I'm not worried. Brother
[44:43] Jason, don't tell me, "All right,
[44:44] brother, don't hit this and don't hit
[44:46] that." What he's saying is take your
[44:48] liberty you at home.
[44:49] What is he doing? He's giving me his
[44:51] consent.
[44:52] What kind of consent for me to be as
[44:54] wild and radical as God will let me be.
[45:00] Hallelujah.
[45:01] Now, I don't get that everywhere I go.
[45:03] Hallelujah. Sometimes preachers, they,
[45:06] you know, they'll say, "Brother, take
[45:08] your liberty." You know, but then there
[45:10] are some, hallelujah, where my liberty
[45:12] is too much and they'll say, "Brother,
[45:14] obey God now.
[45:18] I know what that mean.
[45:21] Hallelujah. I know what that mean. We We
[45:24] don't know what you might do. So
[45:26] just be careful, brother.
[45:29] Hallelujah. See, you know when somebody
[45:31] has given you consent or not,
[45:34] you know, and I've been Chris, I began
[45:35] to think about this. You know, we had
[45:37] something in the states a couple years
[45:39] ago. It was called a meto movement.
[45:42] And that whole thing was about what?
[45:45] consent.
[45:48] Men took advantage of women. Women both
[45:52] ways. Women took advantage of men.
[45:56] See, JD, they don't believe the men can
[45:58] have a me too movement.
[46:00] I've been taking advant Oh my god.
[46:06] H. But nowadays, we're in a day where
[46:08] women are just as much aggressive as men
[46:12] and dirty and nasty. Oh, let me let me
[46:14] move on. Let me move on.
[46:16] Let me move on.
[46:17] Hallelujah. But when we think about it,
[46:20] the Me Too movement was all about
[46:22] consent.
[46:24] And now it is that women coming up from
[46:26] out of their past 10, 15, 20 years
[46:29] later, putting men on blast say, "Well,
[46:32] he," you know how they did Bill? Bill
[46:33] was a pill dropper.
[46:36] Say, "Bill was dropping blue pills in
[46:38] people drink."
[46:39] And the women say, "I didn't give him
[46:41] consent." No matter how much money he
[46:43] had, he had to pay for not having that
[46:46] person's permission.
[46:48] 20 years later,
[46:50] oh my. And what's so sad, some of us are
[46:53] paying for things 20 years later
[46:56] because you didn't give consent.
[46:59] Oh my. But this man at the pool,
[47:03] he he sees the waters troubled. Now,
[47:07] even the prophet of God said it don't
[47:09] say what kind of sickness he had, but he
[47:12] was strong enough to get up and try to
[47:14] get to the pool.
[47:17] We don't want to just be strong enough
[47:18] to come to church.
[47:20] We want to touch the blessing.
[47:22] Hallelujah.
[47:23] We want to receive the blessing.
[47:25] Hallelujah. We want to become one with
[47:27] the blessing. Hallelujah. When we leave
[47:29] the porch, when we leave the porch
[47:31] tonight of Bethl Tabernacle, we should
[47:34] be able to say, "Hallelujah. I was in
[47:36] the water."
[47:38] I didn't just see it move. I didn't saw
[47:41] that for 38 years. But tonight, I got in
[47:44] the water.
[47:47] Hallelujah. Oh, hey.
[47:50] Tonight I got in the water and I was
[47:53] affected by the moving of the angel.
[47:56] Hallelujah. But look this man,
[47:59] hallelujah. He see the angel come jump
[48:02] in the water
[48:03] and he pick up all of his sickness
[48:07] and he tries to get there
[48:10] and somebody jumps in. Can you imagine?
[48:13] Can you imagine, Sister Watkins?
[48:15] Hallelujah. You almost there and
[48:18] somebody jump in before you, look at you
[48:21] and say,
[48:25] wink at you. Yeah,
[48:28] I don't know about you, but that make me
[48:30] want to fight.
[48:32] You know I needed this and you going to
[48:35] jump in before me
[48:36] and then once you get it, you going to
[48:38] wink at me.
[48:40] This means war.
[48:42] This means I'm watching that pool 24
[48:45] hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a
[48:50] year. Cuz you know why? I ain't going to
[48:52] let you do that to me again. That's what
[48:54] we should be saying to the enemy.
[48:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Lord, I seen
[48:59] your spirit move, but I didn't take
[49:01] advantage of it. But tonight, this means
[49:03] war.
[49:05] I will not leave out of here without
[49:08] getting dipped in the water.
[49:13] Too often we experience the anointing.
[49:18] We experience good worship. But when
[49:21] it's time to be changed,
[49:23] we continue to carry our sickness.
[49:28] But look,
[49:30] this man
[49:32] now, he sees the water trouble. He
[49:35] notice it, but he can't get there. So he
[49:38] goes back to being what he was, sick,
[49:42] carrying the sickness, waiting on
[49:44] another season.
[49:46] My
[49:48] but then this day in the porch.
[49:50] Hallelujah.
[49:52] The angel of angels come in.
[49:57] Hallelujah. Church, you don't have to
[50:00] wait to find just a good quote in the
[50:02] message before you receive your healing.
[50:05] I'm here to say that the angel of angels
[50:07] is here.
[50:08] Hallelujah. He's the one that sent the
[50:11] angel to trouble the water. And now we
[50:14] have access to the angel himself. But
[50:17] the problem is, will you give him
[50:19] consent?
[50:24] Hallelujah.
[50:25] Oh my. But look,
[50:29] the angel of angels,
[50:31] the Lord Jesus
[50:33] comes to the pool. And you know what,
[50:35] Sister Y? This is what we have to
[50:38] realize. When Jesus stepped his first
[50:41] foot, hallelujah, on the porches,
[50:44] hallelujah. When he stepped on that
[50:47] porch, everything, everybody in that
[50:50] pool on those five porches, whatever
[50:52] they needed, he was that.
[50:55] Hallelujah.
[50:56] Hallelujah. He said they say they were
[50:59] impotent, blind, hallelujah, mold, sick,
[51:02] whatever they was, what everybody needed
[51:05] was wrapped up in Jesus.
[51:09] Hallelujah.
[51:10] Brother D, what are you saying? I'm
[51:12] saying tonight if you could just respond
[51:14] to him, everything you need is sitting
[51:17] at your pool.
[51:23] When Jesus stepped up to the pool,
[51:25] Jehovah Rafa was there. When he stepped
[51:28] up to the pool, Jehovah Gyra was there.
[51:32] Jehovah Ni, the one who fights my
[51:34] battles,
[51:36] he was there.
[51:37] Everything this man, Halu, who was sick
[51:41] for 38 years, everything he needed, his
[51:44] deliverance was right there.
[51:46] Amen.
[51:47] When Jesus stepped on the scene,
[51:51] we talking about consent.
[51:55] Jesus starts to talk to him. First thing
[51:58] Jesus asks him is,
[52:00] "Will thou be made whole?"
[52:05] He's God. He can do whatever,
[52:09] but he ain't going to do it without your
[52:10] permission.
[52:15] Let's go to Mark the 6th chapter.
[52:18] Everybody all right, sir.
[52:20] Mark chapter 6. Y'all know I ain't going
[52:21] to be long. I'm about to close.
[52:27] And we've heard it so many times that
[52:30] God is not a brute. He's a lover.
[52:33] Hallelujah. Therefore, he's not going to
[52:35] force himself on you. He wants a full
[52:39] surrender.
[52:40] Hallelujah.
[52:41] Oh my. You know, it's like getting into
[52:44] a fight with somebody who has a skill
[52:47] level way above yours.
[52:49] And you come out to fight and that
[52:51] person know he's going to drag you
[52:53] through the mud. And they might even ask
[52:55] you, "Remember before we do this, you
[52:59] wanted it.
[53:04] You wanted this whipping you about to
[53:05] get
[53:06] because I know my skill level is is head
[53:08] and shoulders above yours. But you still
[53:11] want to fight me. Now if I break your
[53:13] arm, you ask for it.
[53:16] Church, y'all know that's how we should
[53:18] be talking to the devil.
[53:20] That's right.
[53:21] Hallelujah. He mess up your house, mess
[53:24] up your your your your your body and
[53:27] different things. Hallelujah. When you
[53:28] go into prayer, you ought to say to the
[53:30] devil, "Now I was minding my business,
[53:32] honey, but you going to come to my house
[53:34] and do this. Now you ask for what you
[53:37] about to get."
[53:41] Hallelujah. Oh my. I feel my helper
[53:42] coming out.
[53:44] Feel good.
[53:45] Hallelujah. Oh my.
[53:48] Oh my. Listen, I said Mark chapter 6,
[53:51] right?
[53:52] Listen
[53:53] right here. Uh let's just start at verse
[53:55] one if we can. Mark 6 and1 the Bible
[53:59] says that he went out from then and came
[54:02] into his own country and his disciples
[54:04] followed him. Next verse.
[54:07] And when the Sabbath day was come, he
[54:10] began to teach in the synagogues and
[54:12] many hearing him were astonished,
[54:14] saying, from whence had this man these
[54:17] things? And what wisdom? Now look,
[54:19] they're saying, "And what wisdom is
[54:21] this, which he giveth unto him, that
[54:24] even such mighty works are wrought by
[54:26] his hands?"
[54:28] Keep going.
[54:30] Is not this the carpenter, the son of
[54:33] Mary, the brother of James and Joseph, a
[54:35] and Judah, and Simon, and are not his
[54:38] sisters here with us? And they were
[54:41] offended.
[54:43] They were offended at what? His wisdom.
[54:46] Amen.
[54:47] Amen.
[54:51] You know that still happens today. You
[54:54] give people Bible wisdom and they I
[54:56] won't do it. Let me do what I want. Let
[54:58] me You know how young people say, "Mom,
[55:00] dad, let me go through my own struggle.
[55:05] I need to experience it for myself. All
[55:08] right. All right. Go on out there and
[55:09] get beat up then." What they doing is
[55:12] they asking for your consent to get
[55:14] whoop up by the devil.
[55:17] And I'm sorry. I ain't one of them
[55:18] parents that going to say, "Okay,
[55:23] now I ain't going to let you destroy my
[55:25] peace, but I tell you, go just leave me
[55:27] alone." Then I go pray for them.
[55:31] Hallelujah.
[55:34] What we ought not to be doing is, well,
[55:37] if they predestinated, they going to
[55:38] come anyway.
[55:40] That's all right. But what about all the
[55:42] things in between that before their
[55:44] awakening? Hallelujah. That's when you
[55:46] ought to be praying. Hallelujah. Because
[55:49] they're going to give consent to things,
[55:50] hallelujah, that they shouldn't.
[55:52] Hallelujah. But if you on the other end
[55:54] praying, Hal, God say he's given us the
[55:57] power to bind and to loose. Hallelujah.
[56:00] You have the power to snap the devil's
[56:02] hand back.
[56:04] Hallelujah. I ain't waiting on no
[56:06] millennium and all these things to claim
[56:07] my child. Hallelujah. I'm claiming them
[56:09] right now.
[56:13] Well, they predestinated. That's you
[56:16] just being wishywashy.
[56:19] Get on your knees and cry out for that
[56:20] child.
[56:21] Hallelujah. Oh my. Give me the next
[56:24] verse.
[56:27] But Jesus saith unto them, "A prophet is
[56:30] not without honor, but in his own
[56:32] country, and among his own kin, and in
[56:35] his own house."
[56:38] Oh my. and he could there do no mighty
[56:46] works.
[56:48] Now this was the same Jesus, hallelujah,
[56:52] in spirit created the worlds.
[56:55] Hallelujah. That same Jesus, hallelujah,
[56:58] in spirit that only lets the waves of
[57:01] Buford, South Carolina come in so far
[57:04] and back back up. Hallelujah.
[57:06] Hallelujah. He's controlling everything.
[57:08] But in this verse, he can't do nothing
[57:11] without consent.
[57:16] He said, he said he could not do mighty
[57:20] works saved. He laid hands. He laid his
[57:24] hands upon a few sick folk and healed
[57:26] them. Next verse.
[57:28] And he marveled because of their
[57:30] unbelief.
[57:32] Now God is all knowing. He knows
[57:34] everything. All power in his hand. But
[57:37] if there's unbelief, he can't touch you.
[57:43] Why? Cuz you haven't given him consent
[57:46] yet.
[57:49] My Now, in that moment, everything that
[57:53] the children of of of Nazareth, all the
[57:56] people of Nazareth, everything they
[57:58] needed was right there in Jesus.
[58:00] Just like the man at the pool of
[58:02] Bethesda, everything he needed was in
[58:04] Jesus. But what does he do? God says,
[58:07] "Will I be made whole?" He say, "Well,
[58:11] I ain't got I ain't got nobody to put me
[58:13] in the water." God ain't ask him that.
[58:18] I've been sick 38 years. God ain't ask
[58:20] him that.
[58:22] I ain't quick enough to get God ain't
[58:24] asked him that. All God wanted was
[58:26] consent.
[58:31] We take God all the way around the
[58:33] mountain when all he want is a yes.
[58:37] Will you give him a yes tonight?
[58:39] All he want is a yes.
[58:41] And once he gets a yes, your problem is
[58:44] his problem. Now
[58:53] reason why I title is does he have
[58:55] consent? because you're either giving it
[58:57] to God or to the devil.
[59:01] Listen,
[59:03] this is one of my favorite messages,
[59:05] Matt. Hallelujah.
[59:08] The fundamental foundation of faith.
[59:10] Listen what the prophet of God says.
[59:12] Everybody all right?
[59:14] Hallelujah. He says, "Now Satan by his
[59:18] laws of sin." You mean to tell me sin
[59:21] has a law? Amen.
[59:24] Satan by his laws of sin. So Satan has
[59:28] rights to the laws of sin.
[59:32] Oh my. You say, "Belie, what you mean
[59:34] law?" It's just like coming down here.
[59:36] The speed limit was 70. Holy. Anything
[59:40] over that,
[59:47] I want to say you're breaking the law.
[59:50] But in my case, JD is a grace period.
[59:56] I ain't going to give the devil consent
[59:57] to write me no ticket.
[1:00:01] So, I'm going work it for my good.
[1:00:02] Hallelujah.
[1:00:05] Hallelujah. Some of us drive like we on
[1:00:07] the autobond.
[1:00:09] My car say 220, so I should be able to
[1:00:11] do 220.
[1:00:15] You've given yourself consent
[1:00:19] to die.
[1:00:23] You giving yourself consent to get in a
[1:00:25] crash.
[1:00:26] And in some of our cases, we giving you
[1:00:28] you giving your car consent to blow up.
[1:00:32] No, that car shouldn't be doing no 220.
[1:00:36] Hallelujah. But look, look, law sin has
[1:00:40] a law and that law belongs to sin. The
[1:00:43] law of sin belongs to who? The devil.
[1:00:47] He says, "Now Satan by his love I feel
[1:00:50] like I'm running out of time." He said,
[1:00:52] "Now Satan by his law of sin and death
[1:00:55] makes everything that sin and death
[1:00:57] brought operate."
[1:00:59] So once you once you hallelujah fall
[1:01:02] under the law of sin, then you become
[1:01:05] under the hands of the enemy
[1:01:08] because sin belongs to him. So he has
[1:01:10] the power to make you do what you don't
[1:01:13] want to do.
[1:01:16] Because you're operating under that law.
[1:01:19] Hallelujah. That's just like me. I go I
[1:01:21] go someplace and and I and I break the
[1:01:23] law and I say, "Uh, let's just I just
[1:01:25] got back from Canada. I did something in
[1:01:27] Canada." And they say, "You broke the
[1:01:29] law." And I say, "It's all right in
[1:01:30] America." You know what they're going to
[1:01:32] tell me? You ain't in America.
[1:01:36] Put your hands behind your back.
[1:01:40] Hallelujah. And that's what we're trying
[1:01:43] to do. Hallelujah. We want to live like
[1:01:45] Luther in his day. We want to live like
[1:01:48] Wesley in his day. We want to live like,
[1:01:50] oh man, you know, we got gifts and all
[1:01:53] these things. Yes. All of that is a part
[1:01:55] of it. Hallelujah.
[1:01:56] But church, we want to operate in what's
[1:01:59] been given to us.
[1:02:01] And all of it. Yeah.
[1:02:05] Look, he says, "And Satan sends Oh my."
[1:02:10] He said, "Satan sends cancer." The man
[1:02:14] recognizes it and receives it.
[1:02:20] How many ever went to the doctor fine
[1:02:23] and you got there and say, "Oh, we seen
[1:02:24] a lump so and so a place this and that."
[1:02:26] You you wouldn't even think about no
[1:02:28] lump when you went to the doctor that
[1:02:29] morning. But you went there and the
[1:02:31] doctor say we seen a lump X Y Z over
[1:02:33] here on your chest or your breast
[1:02:35] wherever on your neck we seen a lump and
[1:02:37] we need to do some X-rays. Now right
[1:02:39] there in that moment it doesn't have
[1:02:42] life yet.
[1:02:50] It's just something that the doctor
[1:02:52] sees.
[1:02:55] It could be too much lotion.
[1:03:01] It could be a piece of soap that you
[1:03:02] didn't get off and it didn't dry it up
[1:03:05] or it can be a big chunk of dirt,
[1:03:09] but the doctor's going to interpret it
[1:03:12] according to his knowledge.
[1:03:14] And he says, "Hey, Debbie, that lump and
[1:03:17] that blah blah blah is uh we need to do
[1:03:19] some test." And you say, "Okay, all
[1:03:21] right. Do your test. Everything still is
[1:03:23] good." Hallelujah. But then you come
[1:03:25] back for your results and they say, "Oh,
[1:03:28] that lump we saw, it was cancerous. It
[1:03:31] still ain't alive yet.
[1:03:34] Still ain't alive yet." You know what
[1:03:37] happened? It's still in thought form.
[1:03:41] It's still just a bird flying over your
[1:03:44] head.
[1:03:45] It has no power. It can't make you sick.
[1:03:47] It can't even operate. Why? Cuz you
[1:03:50] hadn't received it yet.
[1:03:52] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:03:54] But once you once they say you got
[1:03:56] cancer, we need to operate. This is why
[1:03:58] XYZ take these pills. Set up the chemo.
[1:04:01] Once you receive it, you gave it
[1:04:03] consent. Hallelujah. To operate under
[1:04:06] the law of what it is,
[1:04:10] the law of death.
[1:04:12] Hallelujah.
[1:04:14] Oh my. But what happens if you see it
[1:04:17] and then you say, "I don't have it."
[1:04:21] You cast it down. You don't give it
[1:04:23] consent. So therefore, it has no entry
[1:04:26] point.
[1:04:28] Hallelujah. See, I know right now what
[1:04:30] we're dealing with is a little bit of
[1:04:31] demonology. Hallelujah.
[1:04:33] Because we let the enemy know that we
[1:04:34] know how you operate.
[1:04:36] Amen.
[1:04:36] Hallelujah.
[1:04:38] Hallelujah.
[1:04:39] That's right.
[1:04:40] He said we s cancer. You recognize it,
[1:04:46] receive it. Satan sends heartache. We
[1:04:49] recognize it and receive it. Now the
[1:04:52] question is, what has the devil sent to
[1:04:54] you? You recognized it and received it.
[1:05:00] Any sickness in this room,
[1:05:03] if God hadn't allowed it for your growth
[1:05:06] and you received it under the law of sin
[1:05:09] and death, it's there to destroy you.
[1:05:16] But then he goes
[1:05:18] and he says, "If Satan by his power
[1:05:23] can make the laws work in man, how much
[1:05:26] more of God with his power?"
[1:05:29] Hallelujah.
[1:05:31] How much more the law of God should be
[1:05:34] able to work just like you receiving a
[1:05:36] note of cancer or or or an X-ray of of
[1:05:40] of this or x-ray of that or sugar in
[1:05:42] your blood all these things and you
[1:05:44] receive it. H
[1:05:48] how many knows
[1:05:50] that your body is supposed to have sugar
[1:05:52] in it?
[1:05:57] Now, I'm not talking about the magnitude
[1:05:59] to make you sick, but I'm saying
[1:06:01] hallelujah. Our bodies produce what?
[1:06:04] Insulin.
[1:06:06] Hallelujah. What turns it into diabetes?
[1:06:11] You receiving the thought of it.
[1:06:16] Hallelujah. Now, I know when we get to
[1:06:18] talking about stuff like this, what the
[1:06:20] enemy starts saying is, "Well, brother
[1:06:21] D, you don't understand my situation.
[1:06:24] I'mma call you the man at the pool.
[1:06:26] Amen.
[1:06:28] Cuz Jesus asked one question. Will thou
[1:06:31] be made whole?
[1:06:32] He asked for your excuses.
[1:06:34] He ain't ask for no X-ray that you got
[1:06:36] last year, 10 years ago.
[1:06:38] He asked one question. If you can
[1:06:40] receive that, why not receive me?
[1:06:44] Receive who I am. Receive Hallelujah.
[1:06:47] the power that I bring when I step in
[1:06:49] the room.
[1:06:50] Amen.
[1:06:51] Hallelujah.
[1:06:53] Hallelujah. It's just that easy.
[1:06:55] Hallelujah. First, the brother of God
[1:06:58] say first is just a thought. He say what
[1:07:01] makes it alive when you receive that
[1:07:03] thought.
[1:07:05] When you receive that thought, you give
[1:07:07] it life to operate according to whatever
[1:07:09] it is.
[1:07:11] Hallelujah. But as long as you cast it
[1:07:13] down, the Bible says resist the devil
[1:07:16] and he'll what? Flee. Hallelujah. This
[1:07:19] ain't rocket science, church. is just
[1:07:21] simple hallelujah simple ordinary faith
[1:07:25] in God.
[1:07:28] Look he says if Satan by his laws be
[1:07:34] sure and us recognize it how much more
[1:07:36] ought God through his children to make
[1:07:39] make his laws be recognized among his
[1:07:41] people of divine healing revelation
[1:07:44] power gifts manifestation. Now he named
[1:07:47] the things that Satan laws operate
[1:07:49] under. And now he comes and name the
[1:07:51] things that God's laws operate under. He
[1:07:54] said we should be able to receive of
[1:07:56] God. Hallelujah. In divine healing
[1:07:59] that's in God's law, revelation, God's
[1:08:02] law, his power, God's law, his gifts,
[1:08:06] God's law, manifestations of the spirit.
[1:08:10] Those are the things we should be able
[1:08:11] to operate in
[1:08:13] when we receive God. when we give God
[1:08:15] consent.
[1:08:18] Amen.
[1:08:19] Oh my
[1:08:20] church, it's is it's I don't I don't I
[1:08:24] don't want to take it lightly,
[1:08:26] but
[1:08:28] God has made the way plain for us.
[1:08:31] And all I said this earlier, all he want
[1:08:34] is a yes.
[1:08:38] Jesus walks up. He says, "Will thou be
[1:08:40] made whole?" All he had to do was say,
[1:08:43] "Yes, Lord."
[1:08:44] and it would have been over. But he go
[1:08:46] way he dolly parting way around the
[1:08:48] mountain when he come way around the
[1:08:50] mountain
[1:08:53] as soon as he would have said yes.
[1:08:58] Now he got to that point. But how many
[1:09:01] of us talk about the devil before we
[1:09:03] receive what we ought to in God's
[1:09:05] presence?
[1:09:07] He in God's presence giving credit to
[1:09:10] his sickness.
[1:09:14] In one place, Jesus was doing some
[1:09:17] powerful things and he had to ask the
[1:09:19] church, "Believest thou this?"
[1:09:22] Because it wasn't going over like it was
[1:09:24] supposed to.
[1:09:27] All he wanted is spiritual consent. All
[1:09:29] he want is your permission. Hallelujah.
[1:09:31] All he want is you to say, "Okay." Now,
[1:09:33] listen what I hope y'all don't mind.
[1:09:34] Hallelujah. Listen. He says, "So when
[1:09:36] you feel that you got a stubborn spirit,
[1:09:39] uhoh,
[1:09:41] stubborn spirit,
[1:09:44] you know, the Bible say stubborn is as
[1:09:45] the spirit of witchcraft."
[1:09:48] You know how you you mama, daddy, I they
[1:09:51] get on my
[1:09:53] I ain't doing nothing.
[1:09:57] You be careful
[1:10:00] because in the spirit with that stubborn
[1:10:03] spirit, you on a broom with a long nose
[1:10:06] and a pointy hat,
[1:10:08] witchcraft,
[1:10:12] my listen. So when you feel you got a
[1:10:15] stubborn spirit, now I just love how
[1:10:17] simple the prophet make things. Oh my.
[1:10:21] Look, what I'm about to say don't
[1:10:23] require a prayer line.
[1:10:27] All it requires is consent.
[1:10:31] So when you feel you got a stubborn
[1:10:33] spirit, lay the thing on the altar and
[1:10:35] believe God that that thing is dead and
[1:10:39] you'll never have it anymore.
[1:10:41] He said lay it on the altar,
[1:10:43] give it to God and then he says you'll
[1:10:46] never have it anymore. But the thing is,
[1:10:48] hallelujah, brothers, we lay things
[1:10:50] down. Hallelujah. And then later on we
[1:10:53] pick it back up. Amen.
[1:10:55] Amen.
[1:10:56] The father of God say, "Your healing
[1:10:58] will last as long as you believe in it.
[1:11:02] Your salvation will last as long as you
[1:11:05] believe in it."
[1:11:06] Amen.
[1:11:07] Amen.
[1:11:08] As long as you give God consent.
[1:11:12] Hallelujah.
[1:11:14] Oh my.
[1:11:17] He says, "Go, go on and don't even pay
[1:11:20] any attention to it no more." and the
[1:11:23] thing will leave you. Resist the devil
[1:11:25] and he will flee from you. That's get he
[1:11:28] says get away quickly. Oh my, the devil
[1:11:32] get away quickly. He say so hallelujah
[1:11:34] will be my advice how to overcome. He
[1:11:36] said that's his advice on how to
[1:11:38] overcome. Just give it to God, lay it on
[1:11:41] the altar and don't even think about it
[1:11:43] no more.
[1:11:44] Amen.
[1:11:47] You said, "Really? Really, Brother
[1:11:49] Diggs?" Amen.
[1:11:51] Is it that easy?
[1:11:52] Amen.
[1:11:53] Whatever you fighting tonight.
[1:11:55] Hallelujah. You know, when you go
[1:11:57] places, they say, "Uh, would you mind
[1:12:00] doing a survey?" You know, uh, five is
[1:12:03] the highest.
[1:12:06] Some places 10 is the highest. If the
[1:12:08] service was good, you don't even have to
[1:12:10] think about it. You just go 10 all the
[1:12:11] way. You don't even ask the question. 10
[1:12:13] all the way down
[1:12:14] if it was good. But if they didn't treat
[1:12:16] you right, you going to read through
[1:12:17] every question.
[1:12:21] You going to read through every question
[1:12:22] and make sure you get him what's on your
[1:12:24] mind. But if the service was good, you
[1:12:27] ain't reading nothing. You just
[1:12:33] enter.
[1:12:35] But they didn't do something right.
[1:12:38] Was customer service
[1:12:42] up to your standards? two
[1:12:49] and don't let the food be nasty.
[1:12:53] Zero.
[1:12:58] Will you refer?
[1:13:01] Will you refer someone to this place?
[1:13:04] If not, explain.
[1:13:12] You're like, "Honey, you out the box. I
[1:13:14] just got a lot to say.
[1:13:16] Do you have that email?"
[1:13:19] When something has done you wrong,
[1:13:21] hallelujah, you pay more attention to
[1:13:24] your response.
[1:13:26] But when it's good, you just go with it.
[1:13:29] You appreciate it. Hallelujah.
[1:13:31] Church, why do we have so much handcuffs
[1:13:34] on God when all he's been is good?
[1:13:38] All he's been is faithful. Why we
[1:13:40] Hallelujah. Why are we all so reserved
[1:13:42] when it comes to God when he's been a
[1:13:44] blessing to us, church? If we examine
[1:13:47] God yesterday, h everything should be 10
[1:13:50] today
[1:13:52] because he's been nothing but good to
[1:13:54] us.
[1:13:56] Now, when it comes to the devil,
[1:13:58] one,
[1:14:01] he should never get a 10
[1:14:04] except for do you want him to die? 10.
[1:14:09] Do you want him to leave you alone? 10.
[1:14:12] Hallelujah. Church, when it comes to
[1:14:15] God, hallelujah, we should be showing
[1:14:17] God, you have my consent.
[1:14:21] Lord, I love you. Have your way with my
[1:14:23] life.
[1:14:24] But we be on reserve. Listen what the
[1:14:26] prophet of God says. Don't get nervous.
[1:14:28] I ain't be too much longer. I might say
[1:14:30] that about five more times.
[1:14:33] Hallelujah.
[1:14:35] Listen. Amen.
[1:14:37] He says, "So God has a way for us. God
[1:14:41] loves his children. He loves his
[1:14:44] people." Now this this is something. Now
[1:14:46] you think about what you holding back
[1:14:48] from God.
[1:14:52] God loves his children. God loves his
[1:14:55] people. He wants to help them. Now
[1:14:58] listen to this. He wants to help you
[1:15:02] more than you want help. Amen.
[1:15:06] Anybody struggling with anything?
[1:15:08] Whatever you struggling with, God want
[1:15:10] to take it from you.
[1:15:12] Hallelujah.
[1:15:13] Whatever you need help with, God want to
[1:15:16] help you more than you want help.
[1:15:19] All he want is a yes.
[1:15:21] All he want is get in. All he want is
[1:15:24] Lord, please help me.
[1:15:25] That's all he want. That's all that's
[1:15:29] all God want. God don't want no
[1:15:30] explanations. Lord, but I did this and
[1:15:33] you know and and last year and you know
[1:15:35] during co you know I took the virus so I
[1:15:38] still can't move my arms in church and
[1:15:39] clap.
[1:15:45] Lord have mercy. What kind of virus you
[1:15:47] talk?
[1:15:50] But we come up with all kind of excuses
[1:15:52] and all God want is consent.
[1:15:54] He wants to help us more than we want
[1:15:57] help. church. That's why by God's grace,
[1:16:00] I try to be faithful with my tithing.
[1:16:03] Hallelujah. Because I want his help.
[1:16:05] Hallelujah. More than I need it.
[1:16:08] Hallelujah.
[1:16:08] That's right.
[1:16:10] Hallelujah.
[1:16:12] Oh my. Not only just in that area, but
[1:16:14] prayer and and even just coming to
[1:16:16] church, giving God praise.
[1:16:19] I I I I didn't want to I didn't want to
[1:16:21] hear this, but since I'm here, I'll go
[1:16:24] ahead. When Tony stopped singing,
[1:16:26] hallelujah. Lord, send your praise pour
[1:16:29] over me. When he stopped, was no more
[1:16:31] music going.
[1:16:34] When he stopped, you couldn't hear no
[1:16:35] more voices. Everybody like this.
[1:16:48] This ain't American Idol.
[1:16:52] This ain't The voice.
[1:16:54] What that? What that the other one? uh
[1:16:55] uh got talent.
[1:16:58] We come here and worship because God's
[1:17:00] been good.
[1:17:02] Hallelujah.
[1:17:03] We're not trying to outdo one another,
[1:17:06] but we want to give God the praise that
[1:17:07] he deserves.
[1:17:11] Hallelujah.
[1:17:13] Oh my.
[1:17:15] See, brother Jason, I think I think we
[1:17:17] get that part mixed up. His job is to
[1:17:20] lead us into worship, not be the only
[1:17:23] one worshiping.
[1:17:25] Hallelujah.
[1:17:27] Church, I went to a I I brother Jason,
[1:17:30] which one it is? Is it church church of
[1:17:32] God in Christ or the other one? One of
[1:17:35] the two. You know, they got the same
[1:17:37] name. Church of God of Christ, Christ of
[1:17:40] God of Church, whatever it is,
[1:17:42] Church of Christ. But I went to one of
[1:17:44] them because a friend of mine was a
[1:17:45] pastor. So I went there. They don't
[1:17:48] believe in instruments.
[1:17:50] Church of Christ. They don't believe in
[1:17:51] instruments.
[1:17:53] Oh my. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:17:59] Giving me consent.
[1:18:02] Hallelujah. But church, I went there and
[1:18:06] they started to sing. All they did was
[1:18:08] had hands clapping in a tambourine.
[1:18:11] And it was so refreshing
[1:18:14] that they weren't relying on
[1:18:15] instruments.
[1:18:16] They weren't relying on musical gifts,
[1:18:19] but they were just lifting their voices
[1:18:21] unto the king. Hallelujah. churches. I
[1:18:23] looked around, everybody was singing.
[1:18:27] You know why? Because they didn't have
[1:18:28] something else to lean on.
[1:18:31] Now, our musical instruments are good.
[1:18:33] The Bible says we're supposed to use it.
[1:18:35] Hallelujah. Worship uh skillfully.
[1:18:37] Hallelujah. With those instruments, but
[1:18:40] church, it's not a crutch.
[1:18:42] If the lights go out, can we still
[1:18:44] worship?
[1:18:47] Hallelujah. I bet you Oh my. I bet you
[1:18:50] don't have the piano. Hallelujah. in
[1:18:52] your car when you going down the road.
[1:18:56] I bet your song come on. You sing then.
[1:18:58] I bet you going to be there.
[1:19:03] No, we can hear you. Whoever in the car
[1:19:06] can hear you. Listen, he wants to help
[1:19:08] you more than you want help. If you can
[1:19:10] just get that in your heart that God is
[1:19:13] more willing to help you than you are to
[1:19:16] help yourself. Oh my. All he want is
[1:19:19] consent. But he has a way and that's the
[1:19:22] only way. Oh my Jesus. That's the only
[1:19:25] way of God.
[1:19:27] My It's something I want to get to and
[1:19:29] then I'm gonna get out your way real
[1:19:31] quick. The prophet, he preached a
[1:19:34] message called door and a door.
[1:19:37] You know that whole message was about
[1:19:39] what? Consent.
[1:19:41] Cuz he say we accept the Lord. How many
[1:19:44] of us in here are saved?
[1:19:47] He said you accept him as savior
[1:19:51] but I want to accept him as lord.
[1:19:55] What is the lord? Main reason why I
[1:19:58] didn't go in the military cuz brother
[1:20:00] told me he said brother digs I was young
[1:20:03] then. And I guess brother J he can kind
[1:20:05] of see my character. I wasn't I was kind
[1:20:08] of rough around the edges.
[1:20:10] Kind of wasn't really filled with the
[1:20:12] spirit. But I was in church though and
[1:20:14] he came up to me. Hey, he was retired
[1:20:16] military. He said, "I heard you you
[1:20:18] getting ready to go." "Oh, you want to
[1:20:19] go?" I said, "Yeah, yeah, I think I
[1:20:21] think I'm going to go and do it. I think
[1:20:23] I'm going to go and do it." He came up
[1:20:24] to me, Debbie. He said, "Hey, look, one
[1:20:26] thing I want you to understand, when you
[1:20:28] get in the military, you are government
[1:20:29] property."
[1:20:33] He said, "You are government property.
[1:20:35] When they say eat, you eat or you don't
[1:20:37] eat."
[1:20:38] He said, "When they say sleep, you sleep
[1:20:40] or you wake up the next day tired." He
[1:20:42] said, "When they say come, you come or
[1:20:44] you pay the penalty." As he was talking
[1:20:46] to me, I think I was built balding up my
[1:20:48] fist.
[1:20:54] I knew I wasn't military um um whatever
[1:20:57] you call it
[1:20:58] material. Yeah. He said, "I got to do it
[1:21:01] when they say do it." Yeah. You do it or
[1:21:03] you going to pay some prices.
[1:21:05] And I'm like
[1:21:07] once he told me that from that point I
[1:21:10] dodged recruiter
[1:21:14] I was supposed to go take the test and
[1:21:15] sign up everything ready to go take the
[1:21:16] test all that after that I start running
[1:21:19] from them
[1:21:21] because I wasn't willing to give consent
[1:21:23] for somebody to control my life better
[1:21:26] more than me
[1:21:28] and that's why a lot of people don't
[1:21:29] have the Holy Ghost
[1:21:31] because you don't want to give God
[1:21:32] consent to control your life more than
[1:21:35] you.
[1:21:36] That's what the Holy Spirit is.
[1:21:37] Hallelujah. You give God consent to
[1:21:40] control your thoughts, to control your
[1:21:42] body, to control your appetite. You give
[1:21:46] God consent, hallelujah, to control your
[1:21:49] eyes, what you watch, what you look at,
[1:21:52] control your ears, what you listen to,
[1:21:54] and how you interpret it.
[1:22:02] tell you some people don't want the Holy
[1:22:03] Ghost because it's too dominating.
[1:22:09] But when we give him consent,
[1:22:12] everything that he is is now in you.
[1:22:20] Now that's the part to shout about.
[1:22:23] Hallelujah. All of his power in you. All
[1:22:26] of his grace in you, all of his faith in
[1:22:30] you. Think about that. The prophet of
[1:22:32] God said the the Hallelujah. He said the
[1:22:35] faith that created the world is in
[1:22:38] everybody filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:42] That's right.
[1:22:45] Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:22:49] Before I go,
[1:22:51] we want to put our foot on the devil's
[1:22:52] neck. So you can't be saying, "Oh, the
[1:22:55] devil made me do it." No, he didn't.
[1:22:59] You gave him consent.
[1:23:02] Satan can't make you do nothing. I'm
[1:23:03] gonna say it again. The devil can't make
[1:23:06] you do nothing until you let him in.
[1:23:11] Listen. He says, I said, "Well,
[1:23:14] that's up to them. I don't know." He
[1:23:17] said, "But I said, you never know. No
[1:23:19] matter how much you scream, how loud you
[1:23:22] scream,
[1:23:24] how much you pray, that devil's got a
[1:23:27] legal right to stay there.
[1:23:31] He's operating under his rights. Now the
[1:23:35] question is, have you given him
[1:23:37] permission?
[1:23:47] He's got a right to stay there. Not only
[1:23:51] that, but if you supposed to have done
[1:23:54] something and didn't do it, he has a
[1:23:57] legal right of disobedience.
[1:24:01] Amen.
[1:24:02] We go through some things simply because
[1:24:05] we're disobedient. What? Hallelujah.
[1:24:08] What was one of the first operations
[1:24:10] under the law of sin? It was
[1:24:13] disobedience.
[1:24:16] God told them, "Don't touch it or you
[1:24:18] going to die." And they touched it. What
[1:24:20] was that? Disobedience.
[1:24:24] Disobedience does what? It gives the
[1:24:27] devil consent. Amen.
[1:24:32] He said, "Then you know well to stop for
[1:24:34] the cure and and confess your sins and
[1:24:37] any times he says faith will move but
[1:24:39] not when he's got a legal right."
[1:24:41] Hallelujah. Satan knows what his rights
[1:24:44] is and what he has got a right to.
[1:24:48] That's right. Clean yourselves up before
[1:24:50] God and come before him pure and holy.
[1:24:54] Ask then.
[1:24:58] So, brother D, what are you saying? I'm
[1:25:00] saying tonight,
[1:25:02] whatever's going on in your life is not
[1:25:06] a secret to God.
[1:25:10] And it's not a secret to the devil
[1:25:13] cuz he's standing there knowing his
[1:25:15] rights. Hallelujah. But once you confess
[1:25:18] that thing, once you tell the enemy, you
[1:25:21] know what? I will not be depressed
[1:25:23] anymore.
[1:25:24] Amen.
[1:25:25] That spirit got to lift up.
[1:25:27] It got to lift up. Hallelujah.
[1:25:31] It's just Hallelujah.
[1:25:34] You knowing what you have. Remember the
[1:25:37] story in the Bible, the book of Exodus.
[1:25:40] He says, "For everyone not under the
[1:25:42] blood,
[1:25:44] the firstborn of that house will die."
[1:25:46] Hallelujah.
[1:25:47] If you didn't apply the token of the
[1:25:50] blood, hallelujah, you gave the death
[1:25:52] angel consent
[1:25:54] to come in your house and kill somebody.
[1:25:58] Why? Because you that house wasn't under
[1:26:01] the blood.
[1:26:02] But what if the devil didn't have
[1:26:04] consent and you covered by the blood?
[1:26:07] Hallelujah.
[1:26:08] Hallelujah. What if tonight everybody in
[1:26:11] here is under the blood? We covered.
[1:26:14] Amen. The death angel comes to your
[1:26:17] door. Whether it's sickness, diabetes,
[1:26:19] depression, whatever the law is,
[1:26:22] hallelujah, of sin he's trying to
[1:26:23] operate under. Once you put it under the
[1:26:26] blood, now the angel of the Lord is
[1:26:29] standing at your door.
[1:26:33] Amen.
[1:26:33] Hallelujah.
[1:26:35] The angel of God is standing at your
[1:26:37] door now.
[1:26:39] And when the devil comes looking for an
[1:26:42] entry, that angel is standing there and
[1:26:44] say, "You will not.
[1:26:47] This house doesn't belong to you. This
[1:26:49] is my house.
[1:26:50] This is the house of the covering of the
[1:26:52] blood. This is a repented house. This is
[1:26:55] a Holy Ghost filled house. This is a
[1:26:58] house of the manifestations of the
[1:26:59] spirit. Hallelujah. Of power, of love,
[1:27:02] of gifts. Hallelujah.
[1:27:05] This is God's house."
[1:27:06] That's right. And that angel looks at
[1:27:09] the the Hallelujah. the backsliding
[1:27:12] angel that's come to take something from
[1:27:14] you. Hallelujah. That angel looks at him
[1:27:16] and say, "Now get out of my presence
[1:27:18] before I destroy you."
[1:27:20] That's right.
[1:27:23] That's what happens
[1:27:26] when you've given the right one consent.
[1:27:29] Come musicians. Come musicians. Come
[1:27:32] musicians.
[1:27:34] Church.
[1:27:36] Even though he was God,
[1:27:38] he couldn't help them
[1:27:41] because he needed consent.
[1:27:43] Even the man at the pool,
[1:27:46] God couldn't help him until he gave him
[1:27:48] a yes.
[1:27:52] And it's the same thing with us tonight.
[1:27:54] Hallelujah.
[1:27:56] You take your burden or whatever it is,
[1:27:59] you bring it to the Lord,
[1:28:02] but you bring it there, releasing it
[1:28:04] unto God. Say, "Lord, I'm tired of
[1:28:07] struggling with this.
[1:28:09] I'm tired of struggling with that.
[1:28:11] From this point on,
[1:28:14] Hallelujah. Remember, we'll receive him
[1:28:16] as savior, but not as lord.
[1:28:19] We receive him as healer, but not as
[1:28:22] lord. We receive all the joys and all
[1:28:25] these deeds that God has to offer. But
[1:28:27] what about ownership?
[1:28:30] Will you let God hallelujah move into
[1:28:33] your vacant property tonight?
[1:28:36] Hallelujah.
[1:28:37] Maybe your property ain't vacant. Maybe
[1:28:39] you got a squatter in your house.
[1:28:42] Somebody who's there walked in your
[1:28:44] house without your permission. H. You
[1:28:47] know, you can come in that house with
[1:28:49] the law
[1:28:50] or you can pull out your own weapon.
[1:28:54] Amen.
[1:28:56] Amen.
[1:28:56] And you can force him out. Hallelujah.
[1:29:01] Don't let the enemy just stay there
[1:29:04] because he's there. That don't mean he
[1:29:06] has a right. Challenge him first.
[1:29:09] Hallelujah. If you know you've been
[1:29:11] trying to live for God all you can and
[1:29:13] maybe you slip up, you this, you that.
[1:29:15] Remember the prophet of God say,
[1:29:17] "Hallelujah." He said that a righteous
[1:29:19] man is not a sinless man.
[1:29:22] And we're not making excuses for sin.
[1:29:26] But what makes him righteous is he
[1:29:28] refuses to stay in that condition.
[1:29:31] So he constantly gives God, "Lord, I
[1:29:34] need your help.
[1:29:36] Lord, I need your help." Well, somebody
[1:29:38] say tonight, "Lord, I need your help.
[1:29:40] Lord, I give you consent, Lord, to
[1:29:42] control my thoughts. Lord, I give you
[1:29:45] consent to control my worship. Lord, I
[1:29:47] give you consent to live in my heart,
[1:29:51] to dominate me,
[1:29:53] with your spirit, your power, your
[1:29:55] presence. I give you consent, Lord,
[1:29:57] tonight. I approve.
[1:30:00] I agree. I permit
[1:30:06] for you to have your way with me.
[1:30:12] Do Jehovah Gyra.
[1:30:14] Let's pray.
[1:30:17] Lord Jesus, Father, we love you tonight
[1:30:21] and we thank you for being all that we
[1:30:23] need, Lord.
[1:30:25] And Lord, the the question is, does he
[1:30:28] does does he have consent? But now we
[1:30:31] want to say, "Do you have consent?"
[1:30:34] We're not even thinking about the enemy
[1:30:36] anymore. Lord, we strip him from all his
[1:30:39] rights and we apply the token of the
[1:30:41] blood
[1:30:42] right here, right now. We accept you as
[1:30:45] our Lord and Savior,
[1:30:48] Father, that you could dominate us
[1:30:51] naturally, spiritually, Lord, Lord, in
[1:30:54] all that we do, Lord. Let our cravings
[1:30:57] be the cravings of the Holy Spirit.
[1:31:00] Hallelujah.
[1:31:02] Lord, we got young people here. Lord,
[1:31:05] may have given consent through social
[1:31:08] media, watching the wrong thing, listen
[1:31:10] to the wrong thing, but Lord, help them
[1:31:13] to make their mind up right now and
[1:31:14] close that door to the enemy. Take away
[1:31:17] his consent and give it back to you,
[1:31:19] God, for a purging, a cleansing,
[1:31:23] a cleansing of spirit, Lord.
[1:31:26] Lord, and even as adults, Lord, we have
[1:31:28] things of our past that are chasing us.
[1:31:31] Lord, today, tonight, we'll turn around
[1:31:34] and tell the enemy, "I'll no longer run
[1:31:36] from this,
[1:31:38] but I'll meet it toeto toe. I've given
[1:31:40] God consent to be my deliverer."
[1:31:44] Lord, have your way with us,
[1:31:47] Lord. Forgive us for our sins and
[1:31:49] trespasses,
[1:31:50] Lord. the areas of our life that no one
[1:31:52] else sees but you that may be Lord a
[1:31:54] little salty a little starchy or stench
[1:31:57] your nostrils Lord we want to be more
[1:31:59] like you

[1:38:31] Let's pray.
[1:38:34] Lord Jesus, Father God, as we approach
[1:38:36] you, Lord,
[1:38:38] Lord, we want to approach you like the
[1:38:40] scripture says, first believing that you
[1:38:43] is, Lord, you are everything that we
[1:38:47] stand in need of, Lord. So, we apply our
[1:38:49] faith, Lord, into that scripture, Lord,
[1:38:53] knowing, Father, that if we need healing
[1:38:55] tonight, you are our healing. Yes.
[1:38:58] Whether it be deliverance, Lord,
[1:39:00] strength, Lord, all these different
[1:39:02] requests, Lord. Father God, you are our
[1:39:05] Jehovah Gyra, Lord. And Lord God, and
[1:39:08] the prophet of God say, if we could just
[1:39:10] believe you the same in power and in
[1:39:14] principle, we can receive that in which
[1:39:17] we've already seen you do, Lord, because
[1:39:19] you don't change. So, Lord, we lay these
[1:39:22] requests before you, Lord. And Lord, I
[1:39:24] stand here as a manifestation of healing
[1:39:27] through cancer.
[1:39:29] Lord God, that if you did it for me,
[1:39:33] Lord, all it takes is just receiving it
[1:39:37] what you've already done.
[1:39:39] Lord, in these different requests, Lord,
[1:39:41] the counselor doesn't even have life
[1:39:43] unless we receive it. So Lord, we pray
[1:39:46] Lord that you give each and every person
[1:39:48] courage
[1:39:50] to stand on your word and tell the
[1:39:52] devil, "No,
[1:39:54] you don't have free entry into my body.
[1:39:57] You don't have free entry into my
[1:39:59] stomach." Whatever type of cast it may
[1:40:01] be, we bind it right now in the name of
[1:40:03] Jesus Christ. Lord, you see the
[1:40:06] different hands lifted to you see the
[1:40:08] different knees within our hearts. Lord,
[1:40:11] we just want to approach you, Lord,
[1:40:14] knowing that you are,
[1:40:16] Lord. You are the answer to that need,
[1:40:19] Lord God. And we pray that you would
[1:40:21] refresh us in this moment, Lord. As the
[1:40:24] waters are being troubled, the angel of
[1:40:26] angels is here,
[1:40:28] Lord. You've already sent the angel to
[1:40:30] trouble the water, but now the angel of
[1:40:32] angels is here. And all you want is
[1:40:35] consent.
[1:40:36] All you want us is just give you a
[1:40:38] simple yes on tonight saying that we
[1:40:41] won't take this thing beyond the doors
[1:40:43] of the church, but we'll lay it on the
[1:40:45] altar. Lord, you said we lay it on the
[1:40:47] altar. It'll be done away with right
[1:40:49] there in that moment. Just forget about
[1:40:52] it.
[1:40:54] So Lord, we lay it into your hands, in
[1:40:57] the hands of our maker, our savior, but
[1:40:59] most of all our Lord. Lord, we give you
[1:41:02] total preeminence tonight in the name of
[1:41:05] Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen.
[1:41:09] Every
[1:41:11] that I am able

[1:44:25] you pass that back to brother Brad
[1:44:27] Campbell. Amen.
[1:44:32] [Music]
[1:44:35] Praise the Lord. I just want to give a
[1:44:38] testimony. It'll be a year um next month
[1:44:41] for my foot and everything that I've
[1:44:44] been through and my wife has been
[1:44:45] through. And um the sermon tonight made
[1:44:49] me think of something. I I I met this
[1:44:52] this kooky chiropractor and gave him
[1:44:55] consent to my demise of some therapy. My
[1:45:00] foot was almost healed about two months
[1:45:01] ago completely. I mean, there was like
[1:45:05] one little tiny scar and that was it.
[1:45:07] And uh things were going really good and
[1:45:10] I gave this guy consent and put my feet
[1:45:12] in some water and he put some
[1:45:14] electrodes. He said uh it's good for my
[1:45:17] nerves and and he actually uh damaged my
[1:45:21] foot again and and the wound size of a
[1:45:24] baseball took off all my skin on my
[1:45:27] foot. Uh and I'll tell you what, you
[1:45:30] talk about PTSD and and and troubling
[1:45:32] times and for about a week it really did
[1:45:36] something to me. but it's almost healed
[1:45:37] again. So, this is a testimony of praise
[1:45:41] and uh Bo Digs, that was a great sermon.
[1:45:44] I uh I look kind of back at at my
[1:45:49] decision personally of giving that
[1:45:51] doctor who had good intentions consent
[1:45:55] to do what what he did and the results
[1:45:58] were were terrible. So, uh, lets
[1:46:02] everybody know they got to pray and and
[1:46:04] before they make decisions like that.
[1:46:06] So, I just want to give God the glory
[1:46:08] for healing me.
[1:46:10] [Applause]
[1:46:13] Anybody else have one? Brother Caleb,
[1:46:18] I just wanted to give the Lord praise.
[1:46:21] For about eight or nine months, I was
[1:46:23] really dealing with just a lot of
[1:46:25] internal issues. My stomach was just
[1:46:27] giving me a lot of trouble. and me had
[1:46:30] went to the doctor and had procedures
[1:46:33] done and just different things and just
[1:46:34] really couldn't find any relief at all.
[1:46:37] And um I just been praying about it and
[1:46:40] uh probably about three or four weeks
[1:46:43] ago I just kind of noticed, you know,
[1:46:46] sometimes the Lord just does things and
[1:46:47] slowly over time and I just noticed that
[1:46:50] I was feeling a lot better and it just
[1:46:53] been little by little been getting
[1:46:54] better and better and talked to my wife
[1:46:56] about it last week and the Lord just
[1:46:59] really touched me in just a special way.
[1:47:02] So I just want to give him glory for
[1:47:03] that. Amen.
[1:47:09] somebody else here by Luther and that
[1:47:11] back again.
[1:47:15] So, I'm just uh I work for Ace Handyman
[1:47:18] and sometimes the jobs will cancel and
[1:47:20] stuff like that. And this week um had a
[1:47:23] couple of full days and then um job
[1:47:27] canceled out. I didn't have anything.
[1:47:28] And then I had a couple of side people
[1:47:30] that call once in a while and uh it was
[1:47:33] just like that job cancelceled, they
[1:47:35] call me, can you come do this? And so
[1:47:37] it's just it's a little financial
[1:47:39] blessing, but it's just those jobs give
[1:47:41] away and then these jobs come in. I'm
[1:47:43] just like, thank you.
[1:47:47] [Applause]
[1:47:52] We're going to let you go and be
[1:47:54] dismissed. We'll see you back Sunday
[1:47:56] morning. Go in the fear of the Lord.
[1:47:58] Amen. and we'll see you back. And all my
[1:48:00] life you have been faithful.
[1:48:05] [Music]
[1:48:06] Oh my And all my life you have been so
[1:48:12] so good.
[1:48:17] With every breath that I am faithful,
[1:48:23] I will sing
[1:48:26] of the goodness
[1:48:28] of God.
[1:48:31] And all my life you have been faithful.
[1:48:40] And all my life you have been so so
[1:48:45] good.
[1:48:48] With every breath that I am able,
[1:48:52] [Music]
