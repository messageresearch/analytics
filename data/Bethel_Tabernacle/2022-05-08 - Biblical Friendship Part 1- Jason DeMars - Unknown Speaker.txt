========================================

[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] heavenly father we just come before you now lord and we ask that your holy spirit would be with us lord that you would take your word and speak it into our hearts lord we want to just pray and lift up those who are not feeling well today lord may your hand be upon them touch them and make them completely well lord we thank you for this time we have together in your word lord i pray that you would come and make it alive in our hearts in jesus name amen all right i want to speak this is a subject i spoke about probably uh close to two years ago and um it's just been on my heart for the last month or two to go into it again to speak about biblical friendship and so it it's the same notes but uh like brothers know when whenever you preach different places the note it'll come out differently so just i didn't have i also want to say i didn't have anybody here in mind when speaking about big biblical friendship and i'm not asking you to do anything differently with me i'm i'm looking at myself when i look at these notes all right so first scripture is john 15 verse 15. henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you amen may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word so this these notes were really born out of looking at the subject of love and we'll look at the definition more closely but when you when we we as christians and especially as message believers think about love we start to think about the different words that brother branham used and explaining the greek agape and filio and these different things and there's a number of different ways to express uh the idea of love in the greek language in english it's simple it's love but it means tons of different things it could be about food it could be about your friend it could be about your brothers and sisters in christ it could be about the your your spouse your children all these are different types of love in greek they have different words for it in english i guess we're too simple minded so we just say love but we don't always mean love when we say love so in in greek you see the word love it could be multiple different um different words that are used there so the term friend that we have the source of that word is filio so it's just that it's just a different uh tense of the word filio different usage of the word filio so you know when we look at filio filio we think of as a lower thing it's lower than agape and that's true agape is an unselfish love a love that is not looking to receive at all but a love that's looking to give no matter what filio is a love where there's a mutual enjoyment there's a mutual blessing that comes but as christians we can't stay on the level of filio even though that's friendship but the reality is we've got we've got to kind of come up higher and let our filio be covered by our agape love so our friendships are only going to thrive and work as as believers when we're walking in agape divine love we call it unselfish love and so when we look at this this is not about okay uh this is what i'm demanding that other people give to me as christians that's not our attitude well the bible talks about friendship and we're always pointing at what other people ought to be doing on my behalf which is so dangerous and it leads to so many different disappointments the christian ethic is not self-centered it's let every man seek not his own good but the good of others so we we take that and we make that a religious statement and we separate that from well i have my friends and i can do whatever i want to in my friendships no no you can't as a christian our friendships need to be completely biblical when i say biblical friendship that's what i mean our fr our friendships need to be based on the bible we don't have our friendships over here and the bible over here young people if you're listening in we don't have our friendships on one side and the bible over here the bible covers everything we want to live in every way according to the bible including who we choose as our friends including how we behave and interact with friends so friendship it's it's a relationship and just like any relationship it tends towards isolation hurts frustrations it's just a natural occurrence you you first meet people and the friendship is is wonderful and everything's great but then time goes along and guess what we disappoint each other what what can you count on i want to guarantee you something i will disappoint y'all i'm going to do something that frustrates you that makes you upset that's where this going from being on a page to here to hear it needs to happen is because as time goes along things build up issues build up and we have to be able to one lovingly kindly not emotionally speak to one another if we have a if we if we have something where we feel like man there's something between us don't let that fester don't let that sit there that's not loving we think sometimes that's loving we just love covers a multitude of sins that's true that's true but if you have something in your heart against someone what happens you build a complex you can't get around you're not so you're not so angelic that you're going to get around that you still have a flesh that eats at you that that that that wars against what you really want in your soul and so we we have to be in that place where we just talk about it don't be so don't be so um stuck in your own feelings that you can't talk about it then again don't just don't get so easily hurt by everything that you're you're constantly shoveling stuff on people's laps there's a balance in your character and your behavior yes you have to talk about things but don't be offended by everything we become we become easily offended by everything we constantly bring that to people and it brings a separation and it shouldn't do that but as natural human beings it does that jesus says in that scripture we read to open i don't call you servants now i call you friends because the things that i've heard of my father have made known unto you in other words we have we have an intimacy in our relationship that we sh i've shared my heart with you that's friendship we can share each other's hearts with each other we can we can open up our heart to one another i believe that's the definition jesus is giving us the definition of real christian friendship but this is not something we demand we demand it from everyone no this is something we give right but it's also something we build jesus didn't say this in john chapter 5. he said it in john chapter 15 in other words time they grew they listened to him they were with him he he he opened his heart to them so that they could know the things that the father had spoken to him so what's my what's my point in saying that it's trust is built over time trust can also be destroyed over time that this type this type of friendship demands loyalty and it also demands trustworthiness if you have a spirit of gossip on you don't think that this kind of friendship is going to happen if you're telling everybody's secrets to other people you're not going to have transparent close friendships because people will immediately with wisdom say boy i can't open up myself to them because as soon as i say this to them 99 people are gonna know about it so i should be i should be i should guard myself that's natural that's natural now i'm not teaching you to be natural i'm teaching you on the side if if you're struggling and people aren't opening up to you maybe examine yourself all right but secondarily looking at it looking at it this way as believers we don't shut ourselves off because someone has offended us did jesus shut himself off no he went to the cross he was betrayed by everyone and his love didn't change neither should our love change towards one another jesus made himself transparent to us and for us and i guess it got him killed didn't it and we are to be we're to walk in the same footsteps for one another not for ourselves if we look at friendship as it's about me that's that's not what god intends for us that's what the world does friendship is all about me and how this person benefits me and many many christians behave this way i don't believe we should as as members of the bride of christ our friendships should not be about ourselves but our friendship should be about serving and loving other people um i believe that's that's what the lord wants for us selfless friendship that lay we lay down our lives for our friends so i mean of course we look at scripture and we see jesus had the 12 but then he had his most trusted friends peter james and john that he brought close to him so there's different there are different layers and levels of friendship and that's okay and we need to be okay with that um god has a purpose in all that and and and you there's many friends but there's sometimes just a few people that you can really share your heart with and that's what that's that's okay that's normal and if we don't think that's normal we get this idea and we start the jealousies form and this forms in that form it's all right just relax god loves you just the same and we should love each other just the same but understand there's sometimes special connections and that we have to be okay with that we have to be mature enough to be okay with that neither but at the same time to balance that out neither should we be cliquey we just have our clique of people and everybody we just shove them away don't don't don't you're not welcome we just have these friends these are the people that we're comfortable with don't come near us no we need to be careful about that as well sometimes people are broken sometimes people are have been hurt they've had things from their past that have all but destroyed them and ruined them that's what the body of christ is for that's what the preaching of this word is for is to bring really genuinely to bring healing to people's hearts to bring people to restoration to bring people to transformation the love that we have for each other should be transformative it shouldn't be just on this level well everybody just we have our friends we have our group we have our social group and we connect with each other and then please the rest of you stay away that's not transformative that's hurt that's hurtful that's painful what god wants is our love for one another to change each other's hearts because we're jesus to the other people he's pouring himself out through us to them and so we got to get beyond what this guy wants what's comfortable for this person right here and looking to others outside of myself in the next slide there from the uh baker dictionary of the bible says most of old testament about defining the word friend and friendship most of the old testament words translated friend friendship or be friendly come from two hebrew roots the most common terms for friend you can see that there i'm not going to try to read these hebrew words a partial meaning of one who loves in the new testament several words appear in including filo's friend hetairos companion comrade and placeon neighbor along with a variety of kinship turns such as brother mother or child extended to revert to people outside one's family for whom one feels special affection the term mo used most is filo's friend and adelphos brother sister the last of which becomes a technical term for a fellow believer i like that a technical term for a fellow believer the word for friend i think that's outstanding that's what the lord wants us to be to one another first samuel 19 1. an incredible example of selfless friendship and saul spoke to jonathan his son and all his servants that they should kill david but jonathan saul's son delighted much in david and jonathan told david saying saul my father seeks to kill me now therefore to kill thee now therefore i pray thee take heed to thyself until the morning and abide in secret places and hide thyself and jonathan spake good of david unto saul his father and said unto him let not the king sin against his servant against david because he hath not sinned against thee and because his works have been to the word very good this is loyalty and i think this is important we have to have each other's back it's brother jason speaks over and over again it's all for one and one for all we have to be loyal like this kind of loyalty like your dad comes to you and says i'm gonna kill your buddy no i don't i think you're mistaken i think you're mistaken i think your your judgment of my friend is not right and go to your friend and say be careful be careful that's that's real friendship it's loyalty in the face of great loss this is great loss for jonathan why is it great loss for jonathan because he's supposed to be king next if he gets behind his father and deceives david and kills him guess what happens jonathan inherits the crown ins instead he gets behind god and is loyal to his friend to his own personal detriment that's friendship proverbs 17 17 a friend loveth at all times and a brother is born for adversity a friend stands with you in good times bad times but your brother stands with you when there is adversity in other words your friend is always there for you your brother when things are terrible fine then he'll come he's not going to be there with you all the time your blood brother he's not gonna be there with you all the time but when it gets really tough you'll be there but the friend is there all the time and i believe this is speaking of friend as in a christian believer he's there for you when times are good when times are in between and times are bad that's what we need to be there for each other we don't abandon one another when the times get hard job 19 14. job looking at this and realizes that his people that he considers who are his friends really aren't his friends my kins folk have failed and my familiar friends have forgotten me and i think um this isn't to discourage you to bring the scripture and say everybody's forgotten me sometimes we feel that way and thank god we're christians because then we can know actually we're not alone we have a friend who's with us the lord jesus he never he said i'll never leave you and never forsake you and so take comfort if you feel alone you feel like everybody's forgotten you that's okay don't blame him maybe god has a purpose in that maybe he's trying to grow something you i've felt this way i felt this way my family's failed me my familiar friends everybody's forgotten me here i am alone that's right the lord is always with us and the times that i felt the most alone is when the lord has been the closest and don't forget that he's trying to when you when you have times where you feel lonely remember the lord is trying to say don't trust in people trust in me i'm with you i'm here for you find your satisfaction in me brother branham says there's another thing and that i would like to say that is another thing running out is friendship is running out don't seem like that we have friends that we used to have and the friends that we have are not loyal friends like it used to be used to be i can remember when someone got sick in the neighborhood that everybody come around and they helped them with all their work and lended a hand to anything could be done set up with them all night at a time as often said it's truth that we hardly know the neighbor is dead until we see it in the paper friendship i thought man this is so fitting and i just want to say thank the lord for real friends at this church in the time in our lowest time me and my family you all were there for us i'm so thankful there's real friendship still in the bride of christ proverbs 27 10 thine own friend and thy father's friend forsake not either go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity for better is a neighbor that is near than a brother far off so a true quality of friendship is seen here don't leave don't forsake your friend don't desert your friend in the time of trouble be with them help them be a strength to them and look you know he says your your friend and your father's friend such a loyalty there that's that's what the lord wants for us is to be there for each other care for them be with them give give a word of kindness give a word of encouragement when people are struggling james 1 19 know this my beloved brothers let every person be quick to hear slow to speak slow to anger this is a great and important lesson in friendship is are we the one that's chattering away all the time there's times where we need to and your friend is there to listen to you but is that what it always is are you always the one that's constantly talking and telling everything about that's going on in your life but you're not listening real friendship is asking questions and listening and caring enough to actually listen and actually hear and receive what they're saying take it in and and converse about that uh it's not just waiting for your chance to speak okay i'm listening because i really have something i want to tell but i'm going to listen just just long enough so that i can say what i want to say no it's really caring enough to ask questions listen and hear what the people are saying i think the statement is you're given one mouth and two ears so use them accordingly you know listen this goes to every relationship listen for understanding not don't listen just to respond sometimes a person they don't even need you to say anything they just need you to understand to show that you understand and that in itself can bring healing to a person proverbs 27 9 oil and perfume uh yeah oil and perfume make the heart glad and the sweetness or the pleasantness of a friend comes from his earnest counsel or advice i think that's tremendous the pleasantness of a friend comes from his earnest counsel that that's what we need one another for sometimes we don't see things right sometimes we don't see the whole can i say this most problems in our interpersonal relationships in church are because we just don't have all the information 99.999 i can say that as a from a position of ministry i've seen a lot all over the world and it's almost always a lack of information and a lack of even desire to to get that information or know when you don't need to know anything and you don't need to react and you don't need to do anything it's a lack of wisdom and so this is where the sweetness of a friend comes in which can say that you're not looking at this right you're not seeing this correctly and love them enough to listen to what they say respect respect what they say but then help them see the bigger picture faithful proverbs 27 6 faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful so a friend is someone you can to can turn to for advice they care for you they help you with the encouragement and they also help you with a loving rebuke or correction a true friend will speak to you when you're when you're wrong they'll speak to you about it a true friend will not just flatter you with empty words a true friend will say you're misunderstanding you're that's not that's not right how can you look at that situation that way that's real friendship just be honest with one another be straight be real with one another time is winding down philemon 1 10-12 i i appeal to you from my child anessimus whose father i became in my imprisonment formerly he was useless to you but now he is indeed useful to you and to me i am sending him back to you sending my very heart i love that paul calls onesimus i'm sending you my very heart this man who did wrong i mean he ended up in prison who did wrong who who ran away he said i'm sending you my very heart isn't that an amazing statement someone who most people would just write them off as worthless and useless the apostle paul says i'm sending you back not a servant i'm sending you back my very heart and i think that's that's the kind of love we should have for one another not just empty words but really a real christian feeling in our hearts towards one another i think i'm gonna end there i never am able to finish in one session so let's stand and pray gracious heavenly father we just come before you now lord and we ask that your holy spirit would just take these words and and work them in our hearts lord we need more of you lord this this earth and the things that go along with it they they drag us down they tear us down lord but we want more of you we ask that your holy spirit would just be sovereign over the service this morning lord speak the things that need to be spoken and and and soothe and heal hearts and correct us where we need correction father we ask these things in jesus name amen god bless you you you
