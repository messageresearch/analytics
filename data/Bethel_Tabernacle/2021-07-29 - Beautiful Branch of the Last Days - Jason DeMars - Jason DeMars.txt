reliant completely on your work from start to finish lord and our desire is just to put up our hands and say we surrender lord we surrender to your work lord make our hearts on fire for that lord give us a passion a burning flame within our souls lord i can't give it our pastor can't give it we can't give it to each other lord but you can put that fire in our souls lord and i'm asking lord in faith

the way [Music] lord we want to hear what your spirit is saying to the churches [Music] so lord i just surrender myself to you i'm yours lord i'm your vessel each one here they're surrendering themselves to you lord may they may they pull upon your spirit now we ask these things in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen amen let's go right to our text this this evening isaiah chapter four verse one and two that's probably gonna be part one of two or three and my topic is the beautiful branch of the last days isaiah four one and two and in that seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel amen may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated thank you musicians good to have you here brother andrew enjoyed that special amen so i got inspired for this sermon a while back listening to the new album that the brother paul lafontaine and his family put out and i don't know if anybody's has anybody listened to that at all heard of it parts of it there's a song on it they call the beautiful branch of the lord and it's incredible i suggest everybody if you can track it down to take a listen to that but as we were listening to this the first time i didn't even know what happened oh the whole family was listening it at it and we all it was like we all just started crying especially amy and i just something felt like something just busted on the inside of our hearts and and then everything flew fl flowed out through our through our eyes and i think there's something special in these verses and i want i want to i want to show why thank you beautiful branch of the lord you've got two verses they're actually juxtaposed against each other you have the bad woman and you have the good woman let me show you that that's the reality you have seven women said there's going to be in the last days such an aggression that women would have they'll become aggressive they won't be how god made them to be with a meekness and a passiveness but they'll be such an aggression aggressive spirit upon the women in the end time that they will take hold of one man seven women are going to come from here i'm i'm courting you as they say i'm pursuing you i'm chasing after you we're going to eat our own bread we're going to wear our own clothes only let us take our name take your name to take away our reproach they want the benefit of marriage but they want to be they've turned it upside down they want to be in control they want to be the boss they want to be in charge and i think the next verse in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious so on the one hand we have this this branch of the lord that is the bride of jesus christ that's the saints of god and that branch in the last days will be a restored bride will be beautiful and glorious amen so we're talking about women and we're talking about churches right one church says hey i'm i'm in charge here i'm the head i'm in control i'm going to take hold of one man christ and say let me be called by your name to take away my reproach but the reality is they have their own name they have their own purpose they have their own plan and they don't care and that's the condition of one the woman today we have the fruits of feminism that started back in 1850 or so the fruits of feminism what is it this is what the devil has done sisters my sisters he has spoken to you and said you're not normal you're weird it's normal to be an aggressive woman it's normal to be that woman with pants and dressed sexy and out there working in the workplace and getting my own thing and doing my own thing and being an independent woman he's taken that satan has taken that and says that is normal that is good that's out of the pits of hell god made a woman to be a woman why the bride in christ and when that type gets out of its place it's wrong look a woman is not supposed to be a wimp a fearful wimp where would you get that idea but that's what satan's side tries to say gods women sisters ladies are supposed to be where do you find in the bible that the bride is a weak wimp a woman is to be a strong tough fearless lady she doesn't fear the the future the proverb says she laughs at the times to come don't get it wrong being a weaker vessel doesn't mean you're weak you're supposed to be strong in the lord not strong like this seven women taking hold of one man and saying we'll eat our own bread wear our own clothes just give us your name that's not strength that's a woman's weakness when she does that wow when you look at the world today what is the results now we have i'm not in favor of women's sports but with that said with that said what do you have today what's the results of feminism what's the results of putting pants on a woman what's the result of that they don't even nobody even knows what they are anymore not sure if i'm a man i'm not sure if i'm a woman now you got women men say i'm a woman and they're playing women's sports and they're destroying them what is that doing for women's rights i don't i don't it's the devil the whole thing is the devil's playground absolutely and yet it's a microcosm what is feminism doing for the the standing and the rights and the purpose of our sisters destroying them killing them destroying their minds you are struggling in this world sisters why because the devil's superwoman is presented to you all the time on magazines on instagram on movies and you say my goodness look at these marvel super women heroes i sure don't measure up to that why do you want to that's satan's superwoman god has given you a place in a position that is exalted and glorious no one put a woman in a better place than jesus christ i challenge you to find that right and it bothers me it makes me sick what the devil is doing to my sisters especially my little sisters because it's all over everywhere you look and see it's trying to teach you and train you i don't measure up i'm not good enough i'm not this i'm not that you're way better than that amen amen you're a million times better than that little sister why because you're living and dressing acting the way god wants you to if you are if you are you are you are literally the most exalted female yeah on on planet earth amen it's not beyonce sorry it's not kim kardashian hallelujah they're filthy broken-minded destroyed people broken yes sir they're not in a good condition they have billions but they're they're on the way to hell and they're leading millions of people to hell stop stop sisters looking at the world and saying i wish i could be like so and so why yeah why come on because you're valuing the world over the values of god amen god made you to be a lady he made you to be a fearless strong lady do you know that in a marriage relationship that do you know that our pastor is blessed to have his wife and that she influences him and he influences her and that's not wrong so you have a preacher that's influenced by his wife oh that's you guys are all messed up you're messed up your mind is perverted amen i am influenced by my wife and you better thank god i'm influenced by my wife thank god and if you're if you guys sing well i'm a macho man go to islam or something don't look at the world and say gee i want to fall i want to get as close as i can to that why do you want to be destroyed young girls don't be destroyed with the world don't ruin your life god made you for one man that's right amen he made you for one man you realize being promiscuous and throwing your body out to every man that you're you carry that man's dna for the rest of your life scientifically that's proven why you want to carry some stranger's dna amen around with you everywhere you go well that's what that's what the world does that's what the world that's feminism that's that's the exaltation of woman i can just put my whole body out on display and anybody can ravish me with their eyes and with with their life and oh i love women's rights what it's not women's rights feminism is not women's rights it's satan's program to destroy the world a real woman of faith is the greatest influence upon this world when a real woman of faith not a weakling not a fearful we all struggle i'm not saying that there isn't a struggle there isn't a fight but god wants you to be fearless god wants you to be strong girls doesn't want you to be carried about by every win he wants you to laugh at the times to come why because god is your portion not this world not the models on instagram and snapchat and the magazine and the movies yeah amen they're not going to satisfy your soul it's never been proven that hollywood could satisfy a soul bring it bring the proof i want it i want the proof that hollywood and money and sexy dress made people happy it doesn't exist amen amen what in the world am i talking about recognizing your day and its message they don't recognize second timothy 3 where it said in the last days men would be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god truce breakers false accusers incontinent and despisers of those that are good the bride see having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for this is the kind that'll go from house to house and lead silly women silly women led away with diverse lust never learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth never they wouldn't do it and they won't do it god said so and blind pharisee can't you see it i'm not angry i'm just driving the nail in and clenching it neither does the churches recognize this the women can't under under understand it they're supposed silly women led away with divers lusts that's not you bride right he's not talking about the bride the virtuous woman hollywood all this kind of stuff but that's what's impacting that's what's coming after the children that's what's coming after the teenage girls hollywood all this kind of stuff bobbed here wearing shorts wearing makeups all this kind of such stuff which is unbecoming do you know the woman plays a great part in the last days amen do you know the woman plays a great part in the last days amen you know the bible said that those who escape out of this great damnation will be a beautiful branch before the lord someday i'll get to it the lord willing for it for you women let you see what god thinks of the woman that really escape this damnation of this day said she would be beautiful amen she would be beautiful says she would be beautiful and glorious amen that's god's definition of beauty he didn't say they would look like kim kardashian and beyonce it's he said she would be beautiful what is beauty what is beauty come on character worship the lord in the beauty of holiness true beauty genuine beauty amen can i say that sisters it's not it's talking about the bride but remember the condition of the bride is spoken of by the women that make up the church right he said i heard a woman the other day laughing a girl a bunch of half-naked females with more morals lower than a mother dog laughing at an old woman with a long dress listen here you little twisted up female she's got something you know nothing about she's got moral you don't even know what the name is you lost it in the cradle almost you don't even know right from wrong she does amen amen that's the that's the day that we live in this was 1964. brother branham is speaking amen you lost morals from the cradle because that's how your mother is raising you your father is raising you today it's it's infinitely worse than those days what young people are influenced by on a continual basis it's it's witchcraft uh is constantly put before the young people and not only witchcraft uh feminism all these different things is constantly pressurized into the children and don't and don't don't even tell me what happens at a public school what they're trained to learn at 99 of public schools is just absolute vulgarity and this is a generation that's going to answer to god for the perverting of what they've done yeah she's got something hidden in her heart that you don't know nothing about you lost it can never find it don't you call her old fashioned and so forth like that she knows something that you don't know nothing about she's got it she's got hit in her heart there it is she's got hid in her heart amen treasure of decency you don't know one word of it your mammy brought you up like that your pastor permitted it shows where he stands i'm preaching about him right here now amen amen amen so i mentioned before jesus put women in a position in a place that the rabbis of his time never would do that never would do that it wasn't it was there was it was unheard of for a woman to follow along with disciples of a rabbi amen it wasn't permitted it was a shock let's look at this verse mark 15 41 who also when he was in galilee and ministered unto him followed him and ministered unto him and many other women which came up with him unto jerusalem so saying he had disciples that were women that followed him uh oh they didn't like they didn't like that they didn't appreciate that you couldn't go the women had to be totally separate there were things in the law that women weren't even allowed to learn and hear about just things that pertain to the home that's all they were allowed to learn beyond that women were second class citizens her word didn't matter her witness didn't matter when middle eastern culture it takes three or four women to make up the witness of one man in a court case that's the way it was it's the way it still is in many places and so women have less value under other culture societies this was never god's intention and neither and jesus was going to come and correct that now look at this if you don't if you don't understand this sisters if this doesn't make you cry a little bit to see what position he put you in you're not reading it right now when jesus was risen early the first of the day first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils now look jesus said i don't care about your culture i don't care about how you look at things i'm going to show i'm going to show you what exactly what i think of your culture and the value that you place upon women i'm going to first appear to mary magdalene and she went and told them that had been with them as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard it that he was alive he had been seen of her believed not believed not jesus sent first met a woman i believe it's a perfect type of the bride of jesus christ and the place that holds in jesus heart he would meet and and and go to this woman and say go tell my disciples i'm risen from the dead and i'll meet them they say it's a woman what was he doing he was teaching them a lesson he wasn't saying women are going to be preachers now that's not what he was saying he was saying women can be a witness women can testify women can can show forth that i'm raised from the dead in their lives john 4 7 there comes a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink he didn't go to meet the mayor of the city he didn't say i must needs go by samaria there was one woman that he had to meet but he knew that that one woman would do something why because everybody knew that ill-famed woman everybody knew that ill-famed woman they knew what kind of a woman she was and so jesus that didn't bother him that didn't upset him he went and met the ill-famed woman the teachers of that day they were too clean too holy they would never come near such a woman ever jesus came to her and what did she do 29 and 30 come see a man which told me all things that ever i did is not this the christ then they went out of the city and came unto him no jesus wasn't making the samaritan woman a preacher but jesus was sending her to testify of what he had done for her of how he had changed her life and forgiven her sin and he knew she wouldn't be quiet and everybody would know say wow something has changed there that ill-famed woman is interested in religion now what happened my goodness she's different than they should then they came out they came out they listened to the woman they came out and what did they do they listened to jesus christ amen such a such a beautiful thing that jesus does to show the value that a sister has amen all right let's get into some of the some of the types and different things revelation 19 1-2 and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honor and power unto the lord our god for true and righteous are his judgments freeeth judge the great what did i do here i interpose some scriptures here can you flip over josh and give me revelation 19 one and two excuse me revelation 17 1-2 all right and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and taught with me saying unto me come hither i will show unto thee the judgment of the great that sitteth upon many waters with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy or blasphemous names having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth next verse and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus and when i saw her i wondered with great admiration next verse and the angel said unto me wherefore this thou marvel i will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast which carrieth her which has seven heads and ten horns all right you can close that out then so we have a woman riding on a beast in other words when when you're riding on a beast you control the beast and it's it's a woman we understand it's what is it it's churches it's the catholic church the mother and the harlots the daughters the denominational systems they're of the same spirit amen and what are they doing they're riding a woman riding in control not of christ she doesn't control christ but riding in control of the beast the government governmental systems the church the in charge of the government what is it feminism it's a perfect type in the feminism that we have in our world today amen it's a what is the what is the ultimate goal of feminism it's to make a woman into a you say oh no it's to give her rights and do this stop what does it ultimately do it don't make her a nice person don't make her don't make her beautiful in god's sight it turns her into a ultimately a prostitute that that's what she is she expresses her right to do as she wishes by living with how many ever lovers she wants to live with that's what it comes down to and the patriarchy is trying to destroy her life by telling her you should just marry one man and you should be faithful to hear her he should be your king and she should she should be your queen his queen and you guys should be faithful to each other oh my goodness what it how terrible how dare they do that crushing the spirits of the women go out and sleep with every man and ruin your life this is the mindset okay they don't present it that way oh you know a woman should have control she needs to have control of her life she she should be able to do everything a man is able to do of course the devil doesn't come and present you with a knife and stab you in the eye he gives you flowers and he gets closer and closer and closer and then you don't have any eyes left the next thing you know that's how he works and so don't don't think the message don't think that the message of feminism isn't impacting your mind today because it is i listen to how all of us have conversations it impacts even me i don't wanna i don't wanna think like the world you know you you almost find yourself saying well like the old days when they used to have like gender roles and women were in the kitchen and men worked hard and provided and that's bad that's a bad thing that's against god it's exactly scripture how many quotes just go look it up in the table woman's places in the yeah kitchen well we're gonna be off of youtube brother jason facebook's next but that's that is that's the spirit in the world that's trying to come and get us i'm not saying that there's not other reasons sometimes a woman has to work but it's other reason it isn't that it doesn't have to be the default is what it doesn't have to be that's the default of the world i have to work i have to do this i have to have my own paycheck my own bank account i got to have control over everything okay but are you thinking like god thinks are you thinking as the world thinks are we supposed to be conformed to the world are we supposed to be transformed by the renewing of our mind are we supposed to think with these thoughts are we supposed to think with the thoughts that come through the internet on social media and memes and so forth hey hey you're lying to yourself if you don't think you're impact i am impacted by it but we have to fight against it because we're called not to be conformed but to be transformed by the renewing of our mind that means we're going to have the mind of christ and think as the word thinks we don't have this is another great thing we don't have a we don't have any rights when we come to christ we surrender our rights to ourselves that doesn't mean you surrender your rights to the pastor some churches teach that that's not what it's saying it's saying you're surrendering your rights to the word amen and we're conforming our lives to the word period we don't have a right to think our own way if you don't like that take it up with the lord i'm not saying you have to think the way i think i'm saying you have to think the way this bible teaches us to think and the church has been destroyed and eaten by feminism amen and don't think satan's not trying to eat up this message amen with the feministic spirit it's of the world it's of the devil there's an order that god has created the man is the head the woman is to submit to the man amen amen is that okay is that okay to say what the bible says still amen and yet we know it we know that it's a partnership that it's a team yeah that we work together that we we sacrifice for each other right amen you know i'd be a fool not to consider the counsel of my wife she knows me better than anyone else and i know that she's a wise woman so i'm not a fool right so and and you know you have you have a you have a team you have you work together and yet we know the responsibility of headship leadership falls not to the woman but to the man right and there's a way there's a way a sister walks with the lord with a husband that is so incredibly beautiful that is such a picture of every man in in christ every one of us of how we need to listen and hear and submit and say it's jesus it's not what i want to do it's not what i think i want to do what you want i want to i want to do what you want to do this is what's going on this is what i'm feeling this is what i'm seeing and he says i i understand i understand we're going in this direction you may not you may not like it but just just just stay in my presence and then he starts to speak and deal with us and conform us to himself and there's such a beautiful relationship that happens with christ and his bride in that and it's the same thing for for a husband and wife and the position that a woman has in christ it's beautiful yeah it's absolutely beautiful and it's supposed to be it is designed to be fulfilling it's not designed to be easy for a woman but it's designed to be fulfilling and it's the same for a man it's not designed to be easy for a man but it's designed to be fulfilling amen when you watch and see a man he's being led around by his nose by a woman he's not happy neither is she she knows that's that's how it's supposed to be a true woman of god men step up and lead your home so your wife doesn't have to right amen but that's that is our denominational program of today they've left christ out amen and said we're in charge here we're we're we're the women we're going to have our own account we're going to have our own program just let us be called by our names that our reproach will be taken away let us be called after the name of christ well they're never they aren't called after the name of christ it's another a different christ they've committed adultery against jesus christ and gone the ways of feminism but not so with the bride of jesus christ go back and give me revelation 19 1 on the scripture back on the um yeah sorry everybody i'm slowing it down sometimes you copy and paste incorrectly and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honor and power unto the lord our god for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and avenged the blood of his servants at her hand and again they said alleluia and her smoke rose up forever and ever and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped god that sat on the throne saying amen alleluia and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye servants and ye that fear him both small and great and i heard as as it were a voice of a great multitude in the voice of many waters and this voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready amen and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints amen so here's the bride she has a garment on and it the garment that she's wearing is fine linen it's clean and white we saw the the what it was she wearing purple decked with gold silver and jewels what was it showing her exaltation it's a garment of pride right then we have here a white garment clean and white it's righteous it's holy it's representing purity it's representing her relationship to the lamb of god right it's a relationship of cleanness and purity and so you see that juxtaposed against the woman the and the bride one drunken with blood i mean you can't get much of a more graphic statement drunk with blood talk about exalting herself and saying i sit as a queen and have need of nothing and yet here is the other bride she's wearing fine linen clean and white and does he go on to read in her humility the righteous the her her fight the her clothing is her righteousness it's her holiness amen it's the fact that she's set apart unto the lamb of god only right and then we see the results for her who humbled herself to the lamb what are the results it's not drunk with the blood no it says watch her come down from heaven clothed with the glory of god all the precious jewels in revelation 4 that expressed the presence of god now they're in the bride the result of what going god's way following god's order first timothy 2 verse 9 says and go back to the power point in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel that word apparel is the word catastole it means a long dress a modest long dress with shame-facedness and sobriety oh man here he goes again yeah there we go with shame-facedness and sobriety so this is this is the the bride she's adorned she's dressed herself in something that's modest see the bible never says talks about clothes how a woman should wear clothing ah it says it right here amen women should adorn themselves dress themselves in modest apparel a long dress if you want to understand in scriptural speaking a long dress if you look at all the history all the understanding of these different words it's speaking of a dress that goes below always below the knee all right and what is it what is that modest long dress supposed to be characterized as next he says with shame-facedness and sobriety so you're adorning of yourself you adorn yourself on the outside but you adorn yourself on the inside let the outside reflect what is on the inside on the inside is shame-facedness oh boy this guy's so old-fashioned shame-facedness really yup yup that's a bible verse in case you didn't know might not be popular in 20th and 21st century america but it's popular with the bride of christ yes amen shame-facedness what does it mean it's it means dressing with a sense of shame or honor if you understand there's cultures where your behavior impacts your whole family everyone around you your extended family and everything is operated sort of in shame and honor so if a woman would dress like a prostitute it would be a shameful thing not just to her but to her whole family she would dress be honored and honorable it would be an honor and a blessing to her whole family that's sort of the part of where the word is coming from it also speaks of being shy my goodness that's the opposite of that woman those seven women in isaiah 4 1. seven women are going to take hold of one man say give me give me and here it is that a the real godly woman would be shy what happened to that that nature that a woman used to have that it's not so anymore and sobriety speaks speaks of being sober minded amen let's look at the commentary of john gill on this he says that women adorn themselves now i i i bring these commentaries and things like this is because people say and not you but people perhaps on the internet will say uh they're just quoting brother branham it's just it's just branham's interpretation of things all right it's not it's not he's just gathering together what was already there yeah and you can see all of these things so i'm bringing john gill not because john gill was a great vindicated theologian we already have a vindicated prophet but this is you should see and and i think sometimes when people struggle have a difficulty they just point it on and say oh that's just those people they're following that man no it's it's not just that it's not just that and yet that's okay because the man was vindicated but with that said i think this helps your some people's faith sometimes so that women adorn themselves in modest apparel the word rendered apparel signifies a long robe which reaches down to the feet and the word translated modest signifies that which is clean neat and decent yeah beautiful and ornamental and the same and the sense of the apostle is that he would not have them to come to public worship and rags and dirty filthy garments but their bodies should be covered with clean and decent raiment question the answer is number one brother branham does first timothy 2 9 mean a woman cannot braid her hair does broid mean braided hair now look sister i'm glad that followed this i never fixed it there but it just followed that good notice a braided hair in that day was the sign of a street woman that's what she done braided her hair and paul said to christians now that adorning not let it of a braided or broided braid is abroided and braid is the same thing to braid the hair because it looked like the rest of the world now you're supposed to not look like the world or act like the world see the women are supposed to be different there see now no now braiding the hair now today braided hair is pretty and it's a long ways from the fashion of the world amen genesis 3 7 we have our first fashion designers on display and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves says aprons but if you look up the meaning of that word it literally means loincloth they sewed themselves together a loincloth all right then what happened god came down the presence of the lord was in the presence of the voice of the lord was in the garden said adam where are you they hid why did they hide they sinned and they knew they were naked god says adam where are you he comes out to him why didn't who told you he says we hid because we were naked so the loincloth wasn't sufficient it wasn't sufficient covering it wasn't a pro it wasn't god approved clothing he it let them know that they were still naked even with the loincloth so what god does 3 21. god says you guys are not good fashion designers you're sinners your sinners and your your your bikini design needs to be thrown in the trash can that's just that's underwear that's undergarments we're not going to wear that on the outside says them to adam also and to his wife to the lord god make coats the hebrew word is coutinet of skins and clothed them so god clothed the man and the woman how did he clothe them and this is from um the amplified classic version ver adam also and for his wife the lord god made long coats of skins and clothes that clothed them do you see that word long there there's a reason they put that in there from kutanet this is about coutinet the hebrew word the international standard bible encyclopedia says here the coat hebrew coutinet was the ordinary inner garment ward by the jew of the day in which he did the work of the day it resembled the roman tunic corresponding most nearly to our long shirt reaching below the knees always and in case it was designed for dress occasions reaching almost to the ground all right so reaching below the knees always so when you're sitting down it's still reaching below the knees yes amen beauty that's another thing that we saw earlier beauty there's two ways to look at beauty there's the way the world looks at beauty which is ultimately satanic and there's a way that god looks at the term beauty and young people and middle-aged people and old people everyone listening even three-year-olds addie are you listening god divine defines luther says nope she's not god will be the one that says i will define beauty to you thank you very much amen he's not he doesn't want it to be defined by the world doesn't want it to be defined by the devil that's what is de facto for all of you that's what's de facto the world is defining it if you exist on planet earth the world is defining what beautiful is and it doesn't matter how old you are you will see that and you'll start comparing yourself with that and it's a great danger because there is something that's in all of us we want to fit in just make sure your definition is correct amen it's according to god's word one according it's according to god's word two that you're not inserting satanic values into that viewpoint i'm not exceeding values i hate satan okay all right i get what you're saying but but the world using magazines and entertainment is giving a definition to you oh i don't listen to that you do you do because you're not born with the holy ghost you're not born with the holy ghost that comes later when you get converted so when you're little and mom and dad you have a responsibility what are your kids looking at on tv you say we're message believers we don't have tv you have tv so stop it you have tv you're carrying tvs around and when your kid gets fussy you hand them a tv out of your pocket just make sure that with that teaching that they're getting that you're giving them god's teaching yes amen it doesn't and that doesn't mean bring them to just bring them to church that means every day be aware be aware of what your kids are talking about yeah be aware of what they're looking at of what they're feeding on especially in the formative years as it gets older you lose control of that and it's it's almost impossible to keep up but the re in the formative years you be the teacher of right and wrong and know what they're doing on devices and look at their chats and look at what they're looking at and talk to them and talk to the when you're talking to them about it talk in a way that conversation is open that they feel comfortable coming to you always not that they feel mom and dad are always preaching at me and condemning me but that mom and dad are listening to me and then teaching me and the teaching comes from a heart of i just want things to be in order in my home leave that away it should be a heart of love for your children you don't want them to be destroyed with the world not a heart of well i just have to have things in order that's about you you have an issue why why are you so worried about you you should have it in order in your own life but you should teach and instruct your children and don't just leave them to be raised by disney and apps and this and that you're not going to get away from it just be involved i wish we could all move out and get rid of internet and we just write letters to each other and maybe send messengers back and forth i don't know like literal human messengers and we're not that's never going to happen that's not the reality that we live in if please take time to define for your children what's right and wrong what is satanic values when they're looking at images and things that they know this is a bad thing yeah why is it a bad thing because dad says so no teach them instruct take time take time there you're the most precious commodity you have in your life if you're a parent is your children amen outside of your wife outside of christ they're your responsibility and they can't be given to somebody else they can't be pushed off on sunday school teacher and the preacher that's f that's fine and god works for that but the best teacher is mom and dad be involved be very very involved have lots and lots of conversations with your kids and start it when they're little amen what am i talking about the holy spirit is is uh taking control of me i can't i don't even know i literally have no idea how the rabbit trail got to that point shame-facedness and sobriety there's there's a way that god defines beauty shame-facedness and sobriety that's a treasure yeah that's a beautiful that's a beautiful thing in god's sight it shouldn't make us go ooh that's so 18th century that should say that's bible that's what i want in my life sister that's what you should want in your life you don't want to be sexy like beyonce and kardashians you want to be the woman that christ has designed you to be why because that that will give you real happiness real joy and you'll be in the place and the position god has ordained you to be you'll have trouble everyone has troubles billionaires have troubles just multiplied way more than you it doesn't make life everyone on a fallen planet has struggles has difficulties have trials be in a place where you have a supernatural eternal resource you can call upon to deliver you to heal you to touch your heart when you're broken don't be in a position where you have nothing all you have is emptiness that's what the models of this world will bring you towards and that's why i say it's demonic it's not of god what does satan look at satan came to jesus through who peter peter he says i'm gonna go to the cross be killed third day raised again may it never be so peter says jesus says get behind me satan you don't savor the things that are of god but the things that are of men that's that's significant why is that significant what are the things that are man man looks on the outward appearance but the lord looks at the heart what does that mean the lord looks at the inner man the heart condition that's in front of him the heart condition produces everything else in your life the heart condition produced a soul who didn't obey the word of god right the heart condition pushed produced a david who when he sandy repented quick god looks at the heart he looked at the heart of david he didn't samuel samuel a prophet was sent to choose the next anoint the next king the lord had to warn him why because david had some pretty handsome brothers tall strong and handsome tall dark and handsome and he went and said the lord said don't now sam samuel don't look at the outward appearance man looks at the outward appearance but the lord looks on the inside he looks at the heart he looks at the kind of character that man is what do you want to look at young people all of us what do you want to look at character the heart that's what god values i've got a lot more we'll bring it to a closer musicians if you'd come god is looking at the heart so when we are preaching about modesty modesty is not just an outward condition anybody any woman can conform themselves to message standards right anyone can be a fake that's not they're not at the lord is not asking for fake people he's act asking for real people and the it's the condition of the heart that the lord is looking at that's what he's that's what he's looking to and when he wants to see modesty he's pointing at the heart ma adorn themselves in modest apparel with shame-facedness and sobriety he puts two things together he puts the outward appearance and the inward condition the shame-facedness and sobriety would do what it would produce a woman with a modest long dress as that scripture says and so pay a little a little less attention to the what you look on the outside and pay a lot more attention to the condition of your heart because that's what god values that's what god is looking for and if if you're having a struggle if you're struggling perhaps with modesty go a little bit deeper and say lord this problem is not just my outward conformity that's not as important the problem is in my heart lord deal with my heart touch my heart may my value the things that i value not be what the world values but the things that god values that's what's more important that's what god is looking at and looking for is looking at the condition of your heart now denominational people use that to say therefore i can do whatever i want to on the outside that's not what i'm meaning god is looking at your heart why because out of your heart flows your actions and so evil actions are the physical manifestation of an evil heart godly actions on the outside are the physical manifestation of a heart that's been changed that's been conformed transformed by the word of god and let's stand gracious father we come to you lord and we ask that your holy spirit would move upon us now lord convict our hearts help us lord those places where maybe we've conformed ourselves a little bit to the world lord may we may we come to your presence lord and say touch my heart change my heart make me more like jesus

had byc uh which is the first uic we've had since 2019. so i know a lot of youth were really really looking forward to it really including me and this year most of my friend groups are able to go because most of my friends go to like la camp or elf camp in arizona or just other camps that happen and this year basically my whole friend group was able to go and we were all talking before camp and everyone was telling me like things they wanted out of camp and just over the course of the camp it was really cool to see just all of those things happen for everyone praise the lord and it was a really big blessing to see that and this camp more than any other i was praying for my friends more than myself and to see all those things happen was really encouraging and i think it was the last night me and sarah were outside and we heard brother mike sievert who is one of the brothers who hosts the camp talking to another older brother and they were both talking about how this year is the biggest revival that camp has had since 1988. wow so it was just really cool praise the lord hallelujah thank you lord anybody else oh my hands are going up after you're done you pass it back to
