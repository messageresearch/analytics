think I can do it keep you here all night but uh I sure uh have longed to get to this portion of it so I'm asking the Lord just to be our helper tonight amen I've been some of this material tonight I've been wanting to get to in in part five part six part seven and part eight so we'll have brother um Joe Adam with us this weekend and so um just a reminder to all the young people we've invited about half a dozen or more churches amen uh to come for the Saturday night youth service with brother Joe where it's going to be a full service we're not just going to have a little gathering I've ask all the musicians and uh the worship teams and everybody to be here we're going to have a stream and uh we haven't had brother Joe in a little while and he's he's quite a dynamic speaker amen I told sister Jessica she owes us a mini concert on Sunday so we might get a few songs out of her and then Saturday morning Brothers you reminded that we have a a minister I I'm sorry a men's bible study breakfast amen Saturday morning then a youth uh service that evening at 6:30 amen so amen we worked it out with u brother Micah and sister Esther for their event then they went forward we pushed backwards so it looks like we're going to be able to start right up at 6: :0 afterward we'll have some nice Fellowship you love the Lord amen then we're looking forward to Sunday First Peter chapter 2 we hope by the will of the Lord to finish part eight tonight opposing the Judgment of Heaven we've been talking a lot about perfect Faith boy do we ever need it my goodness we need it in this hour oh my I tell you the enemy has just been attacking like crazy and uh today I I I've I've handled three different cases all the devil attacking our young people from the beating he took at Camp amen well what' you think he was going to do just roll over to that no sir but hey greater is he that is in Me Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so we're just trusting the Lord had some wonderful time today in fellowship and working on uh just the enemy attacking but hey y'all know what I say he ain't nobody you're everybody you're somebody you're everybody he ain't nobody he don't make any decisions about God's family at all anything he can get anything he can bring on me he had to get it past my heavenly father so my heavenly father has so decreed well he knows what he's doing I'm not about to tell him how to raise me amen praise the Lord First Peter chapter 2 and I want to look at the first three verses and then we will let you be seated amen 1 Peter chapter 2 and uh I want to start yeah right at verse one excuse me let me get let me get myself there all right wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious have you tasted that the Lord is gracious amen sister Linda good to have you in town with us amen I don't see any other visitors uh greetings to our friends here amen God bless you let's pray let's pray father we thank you for your word tonight and Lord I'm just I I all day I've thought about Lord the verses and and you woke me up very early Lord thinking about this verse it came on my mind and I wondered how it would fit oh my what a wonderful way the Holy Spirit has weaved it into this thought so now I'm giving it into your complete control because it came from you anyway Lord all good things come down from above from the Father of Lights in whom is no Shadow no variableness no shadow of turning he's always consistently the same yesterday today and forever he's always good he's always full of love and always full of compassion so father it's your desire to help us may we desire to be helped tonight I commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated now in a moment I'm going to have the um Brothers take take us to two connecting verses or two connecting places in the New Testament but before I do I want you to think about the Commandment here uh in verse two as newborn babes desire the sincere milk the the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby so babies grow on milk all through the animal kingdom uh babies grow and and milk from the mother or you know milk even that Ma that is man-made in formula and different things like that those help the baby to grow it's not just given them that because maybe they like it a lot of times they don't like it but especially if it's man-made but God uses that to help us grow spiritually so I would say that tonight it's something to be desired oh yeah would you agree but now I want you to notice that it is the precursor to verse two is verse one that you need to lay aside all malice and all guile and all hypocrisies and all envies and all evil speakings so I would I would say that if that precedes uh getting milk to grow then it precedes that because those are the effective things that would stop you from growing amen amen is that fair see if so be that ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious now I want to show you something in 1 Corinthians chapter 3 we're going to catch these first three verses 1 Corinthians 3 1:3 and I Brethren now this is Paul our first one was Simon Peter this is St Paul and I Brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in Christ I have fed you with milk and not with meat for hither to ye were not able to Bear it neither yet now are you able for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men so now Paul is agreeing with Peter to say things like envying and things like strife and things like divisions or as Peter said things like malice and things like guile things like hypocrisy things like evil speakings these things will prevent you not only of the growth you need as a babe in Christ but they will they are an effective hindrance to you moving on in Christ amen see and so Paul is not contradicting Simon Peter but I think that the key to it because it almost sounds like Peter is saying hey you should desire the sincere milk and Paul is saying goodness gracious you guys it seem like all I can do is give you sincere milk yeah and it's almost like like wait a minute Peter kind of thought it was a good thing Paul you sound upset Paul is trying to get you to understand that you're not supposed to stay back there as babes in Christ the whole design of the Gospel is to mature you and move you on higher into into the things of God listen we're trying to get to brother brandham said not a faith he said you've had that he said I'm trying to get you to see perfect Faith amen amen good to have brother George sister Dorothy here also I see them sitting there glad to have them and so we're going to look then at Hebrews 5 and I think we're going to see the key to all of this Hebrews 5:12 is this all right I want to I'm I'm determined to take um the this first part of the sermon I've desired to take this part to deal with nuts and bolts of perfect Faith to really get us to understand we've talked a lot about what it is we've talked a lot about you know that you can't something you can't go get what you have to do is prepare yourself to receive am have we said that over and over again we've showed you that it's a very ancient power it's not something brand new and Paul is actually trying to get that early church up to that level and he's saying I really need to move on into deeper things because we're we we're looking for the coming of the Lord and you need to get ready for a Rapture see but but if you're just if you if you've got all of this ality among you we we've got a problem see now watch Hebrews 5:12 to14 for when the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God the milk the first principles of the Oracles of God this is the milk you feed newborn babes in Christ when you should be you know uh when you should be teachers by now you have need that one teach you again it's almost like we got to go back again and learn the basic fundamentals about what it means to be a Christian yeah see to be a Christian means you got a new life and there's no need trying to press on in deeper Revelations of God if you don't have your ABCs they said brother Brandon why don't you teach them great spiritual gifts brother brandom says how can I teach them great spiritual gifts if they won't learn their ABC see so he says you are become such as have need of milk and not strong meat now it's I I almost inverted these verses just for clarity's sake sometimes I will do that because Paul writes in a very abstract way and sometimes it's hard to grasp his meaning even Peter admits that but but here's what I want you to see now in this next verse because Paul is about to give you a principle all right and what he's just said is a complaint that you're you're not moving on in this principle what's the principle Paul everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even to those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil now you're becoming a mature child of God now you're you're understanding the deeper things of God now you're moving on beyond the fundamentals of Faith see and and and so what's interesting that we didn't read go back up uh brother Caleb I didn't I'm sorry to jump you I didn't give you this one but back up to verse seven Hebrews 5:7 because I want you to look what he's trying to teach them he's trying to show them watch this who in the days of his flesh this is Jesus when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was Hur in that he feared now wait hold it he's talking about Jesus in his human Incarnation yeah that he was a a man like we were he was a human being that was that had fears and that didn't want to die and that had a will that he wanted to live and had to come and surrender that will just like you do he was sh showing us the way a lot of times when we just deal with his divinity we just say oh my he's the Divine God he's Flawless and perfect and all of that stuff is true but he was a man who had to learn obedience by the things he suffered amen am I quoting scripture yes see and so Paul is so now why is Paul talking about his Humanity because he's talking to humans and he's trying to get the people to understand now watch and he cried with tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared now look at verse eight though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect catch it he became the author of Eternal salvation so you're salvation's something that's Eternal you didn't become a son or daughter of God you cooperated in the vision of God found out you always are a son and daughter of God so it's all about growing into your position see the Eternal salvation unto all them that do what obey him called of God a high priest after the order of MDC so he was trying to show that age who Jesus was as the Eternal Father living in human flesh amen see and and this is so that they could that the the reason that and this is so important to Paul is so that when you can understand how the Eternal Father lived as a human being he and and in that human being the Son of God had a Flawless perfect Faith relationship with the spirit of God as a man he's trying to show you this is how you do it this means you're also assigned to be a son and daughter of God a continu ation of that same Ministry and you're going to need to do it just like he did it you're going to have to learn obedience see amen so he's trying to get them to see where perfect faith lies and perfect faith lies in a revelation of Jesus Christ in you and the revelation of not just who he was but who you are making you a continuation of the Lord's min Ministry amen you understand why perfect faith is so important you weren't supposed to just have merely a faith in the Son of God the the design of the scripture is that you would have the faith of the Son of God see amen so this is what we need to understand today so so this is why brother Brandon would come and he would preach how can I overcome and then he would follow that evening with perfect faith and say now you've had a faith but I'm trying to get you to understand a perfect Faith Paul this is what Paul is doing this is what Peter is doing there there is a sincere milk and that's how you're a babe and that's how you get started but the problem is you're supposed to move on into perfect Faith you've had a faith but it's Rapture time this is time for the church to recognize who she is and I'm going to tell you I'm trying to tell you M kzdc but the problem is I can't get it across to you because you're still like a babe oh why am I still like a babe I've been a Christian all these years because you never did Away With Envy and strife and Malice and evil speaking you see and this is why perfect faith is preceded by how can I overcome amen so working perfect faith has never been up to you yours was always a surrendered life and it was always God's prerogative to operate perfect faith in you not you deciding who what where when and how even Jesus didn't do that he said I only do that which I see the father doing brother brandham admits in the early part of his ministry that he really you know he these aren't his words but he talks about how that he made mistakes now no that is his word he talks about making mistakes that's a direct word he uses and the and and the effect of his mistake is is that he's not doing it like Jesus did it he said you know everybody that came through the prayer line he said I just knew the strength of that promise that if you get him to believe nothing will stand in front of your prayers not even cancer and brother brandom said I knew the strength of that and so he would he wouldn't let anybody pass by him and remain sick he was healing get make making sure he'd stop the line if a devil got resistant he'd stop the line and sometimes these lines extended city blocks it was the only Ministry that had that kind of an effect in the world and so he's sometimes he would camp out at the pull pit for several days and he'd pray for people and get tired and he'd eat a sandwich and drink some milk and sit down at the pull pit and lean back and con out and take a little power nap while everybody just stood there waiting for the prophet to get some rest he wake back up and start the prayer line again we're talking about a Ministry that emptied hospitals yes amen amen where the doctors and nurses were reported in the news that they couldn't keep the patients in the bed because the people were streaming running to get to these meetings oh this wasn't done in a corner friends God did something great for us in this hour it's beyond it's beyond reproach it's beyond question questions are ridiculous see and so so so we find that that he that he was stopping and healing everybody and the angel of the Lord took him aside brother Brandon tells it's on tape and he said he pointed out to me that you are doing something that even Jesus didn't do in his Earthly Ministry he said I only do that which I see the father he come he gives the example he comes to the pool of Betha he steps over the top of sick people yeah and goes to one man who's not even really all that sick and heals him says would you be made whole yes okay he's healed and he walks right back out and steps back over sick people and leaves and heals one person amen who's not even the worst case and when they questioned him he just said I only operate by Vision I only do what I the father shows me to do and brother brandham says I made up my mind right then and there that I would pray for everybody but I'm going to let Jesus decide who he's going to heal see because Jesus is the one who knows who really has got a clean heart who really has real Faith who isn't just taking advantage of a gift see and and that you believe me you're going to want to let Jesus operate perfect faith in you you're not because it's superp powerful it can create whole worlds you're not going to want to this is not something you're going to want to try to manipulate all kinds of charlatans have tried to do that I'm glad for a humble Prophet who said it's not me it's him I'm I'm as helpless as a baby until he comes Hallelujah friends and and that needs to be our attitude I'm not anything but he's everything my whole my whole existence is just humility before God and get rid of envy and strife and Malice and backbiting and talking and whispering and all the get rid of carnality out of my life because this is the age when God wants to operate perfect Faith Amen brother Joe good to see you man you should come over here and take my notes and carry on [Laughter] God Amen praise the Lord amen I I came from churches in North Carolina where they would do this that Minister walk in the back come on up here brother I'm right here just pick it up right here that's a true story and okay I got it go sit down and way he would go that was not uncommon that's really what's called preferring your brother amen okay brother Joe is going to prefer me praise the Lord so we're just we're we're covering perfect faith Joe so so we find then that that those things that Paul is not contradicting Simon Paul is not Simon Peter is saying the sincere milk is a great thing Paul's not saying no he's wrong it's a terrible thing Paul is simply trying to show the people that you never you're here you are trying to have advancement you're trying to operate amazing gifts and amazing power and do you not know that God is never going to let that work like that he he will not allow P power apart from character see he's too good of a heavenly father to do that he's not going to give you supreme power because you can't keep it under perfect control see because you still haven't learned the fundamentals of what it means to be a Christian the whole world of Christianity has gone after that they don't even care how they live they just want to operate gifts and and jingle and songs and and and and and you know and all of the nonsense that goes on in their meetings I want the sincere milk of God's word I want it to make my heart like his heart so that then I can understand about who mzc was and if I understand who he was then I can understand who I am and if I can understand the ministry of Jesus to the father I can understand my Ministry to the father see so it's the mind of Christ we found that the mind of Christ is Flowing is is the perfect faith is the mind of Christ I've said this a dozen times I'm going to say it again tonight on this maybe this last part of the series The M perfect faith is the mind of Christ flowing through you unhindered amen unobstructed why because you've cast down vain imaginations you've cleaned up your life from carnality and sin you and and and I'm going to go down I'm going to go down the list here tonight because the application of perfect faith what is it it's the mind of Christ flowing through you unhindered and unobstructed how do you get it you can't get it you can only prepare yourself to receive it you become a a a a a receptor you become a a clean vessel that God can say God can work through me it's more than that yeah God can trust youen that means so much to me yeah I don't care about operating speaking storms out of existence and squirrels into existence if that's what he wants me to do fine but I want to know he trusts me I want to know that if he never tells me to speak a squirrel into existence he can look and say there's a young man I trust Hallelujah that's what I want in my life friends I don't want to pass the sincere milk and try to rush on into great things to get me into a body change that'll you'll never operate perfect Faith like that see brother brandham dealt with it so much and and I I I actually had a ton of quotes from the message perfect faith I had them all laid out and I decided I just I wanted to read them I was going to put them on the overhead but then I thought to myself you know I'm just going to tell you go listen to that message amen and if you started listening to it when I preached part one go back and listen to it again but start with the Sunday morning sermon how can I overcome amen because when you you when you see what that entire Sunday was about it's how can I overcome all fear and doubt to operate perfect Faith that's what that whole Sunday was dedicated to in that message of perfect faith brother brandham one of the here's a just a a few things that he so stressed and one of them because that the strength of Jesus was that two things he recognized who he was amen now brother brandom says that again in Israelite worthy of the Gospel remember that he says Jesus knew his words couldn't fail because he knew who he was see so he recognized his position as a Believer and that's what you've got to do the second thing Jesus had is he had no condemnation in his heart and he said Satan cometh but he findeth nothing in me yeah he hath nothing in me different translations say it different ways the basic meaning is that he's got nothing he can accuse me of he's got nothing he can point his bony finger at I do always that which pleased the father Hallelujah see you say well then brother Jason I'm just out cuz I I never can hardly get through 24 hours doing that but that's why Jesus had to die that's why we have a propitiation for our sins I'm here to tell you something friends you're not perfect but he is but that Perfection should re should Rule and reign in your life and you should say Lord God help me to overcome every obstacle help me to empty myself of every carnality help me to move forward see Jesus doesn't need you to re to do exactly what he did he was a perfect sacrifice on the cross he's not asking you to go die on the cross as a perfect lamb he was that for you but his his desire is that let me live inside you let me live my life through you cast down anything that's contrary to my word don't have that in your life see so it's all about acknowledging our identity as a Believer and and understanding that the that the blessing is is is is for you brother brandom goes that over that over again and again it's one of the very first things he wants to cover you've got to know who you are and believe it amen amen and then he goes back to the example of Jesus that's what he did see and so Jesus recognized his position as a Son of God and you've got to recognize your position as a child of God I'm want to say it like this you've got to recognize yourself say well as a child of God like he was a child of God I'm G give it to you a little bit stronger you got to recognize yourself as his brother amen from the same Daddy yeah amen in the same family that's right in the same seed line in the same Jean Pool are you getting it he's the firstborn among many Brethren see and so he was the first born and so you are now you the the the the the beauty of the of the message of the hour was to come at the end time to take the the the true bride of Christ call her out of a fallen church and prove to her who she is and prove to her and this is strong I hope you I hope you're ready for strong meat to prove to her that she is now the vessel of the word made flesh that's what a prophet taught us he was the word made flesh now you're the word made flesh that was his turn now it's your turn Hallelujah see and and and and that's and brother Brenham emphasize that over and over again go back and hear perfect Faith again you've got to realize that's your position in order to operate perfect Faith because we're not just talking about a faith we're talking about a faith that's going to raise and Resurrect The Sleeping Saints for hundreds of years and change you at the molecular level I'm here to tell you that's going to take some perfect Faith that's going to take a people who are trained how to get themselves out of the way yeah amen can't do it with condemnation in your life that's the next thing brother brandom covered if you're living in sin if you're not only if you're living in sin because if you're living in sin you're harboring guilt yeah right and you'll never you you can't even operate standard faith if you're harboring guilt amen I'm here to tell you something friends let me say tonight because I believe I'm speaking to a group of Believers and if you are a Believer and you have PL yourself in the blood of the Lamb of God and you have committed your whole life to the Lord Jesus Christ you have no guilt Let It Go Let It Go Let It Go refuse to accept guilt because you have believed on him whom God ha sent Hallelujah and there's a bleeding sacrifice for you Satan cometh but he findeth nothing in me I got all kinds of weaknesses but my faith in him is perfect Hallelujah see so you can't be harboring guil you you you you you you if you do that you're never going to be a conduit for perfect Faith it's always going to be short circuited and you're going to be the short circuit yeah see and let me just say hey dads hey moms your children really need you to not be the short circuit amen amen amen I'm aware of that as a Shepherd this church needs me to not be the short circuit it's well I'm tell you something friends we got to cast down all vain imaginations we got to get rid of strife we got to get rid of Envy we got to get rid of evil speaking we got to get rid of carnality we got to get rid of guilt out of our life we're going home we're so close now Hallelujah and the world is so crazy you've got to embrace the entirety of God's word you've got to accept and believe every word of God in this day you can't whatever you do don't pick and choose you'll you'll you just might as well hang up your Spurs if you're going to pick and choose you'll never ride that this hor you'll never ride this Trail again see if you're going to pick and choose what to believe you're never going to ride this Trail again I'm here to tell you something friends I'm marching to Zion I'm not here to pick and choose it doesn't matter whether I like it or even understand it or even can figure it all out I just know it's true and I just say Y and amen and I just say Lord whatever it takes make my life look like that word hallelujah that's the recipe for perfect Faith friends we walk in faith we walk in love you you you you and you can't do that if you're walking in deceit right see so these are the things I mean come on could you do that in a marriage could you walk in love if you're walking in deceit in your marriage there's no way see so we walk in faith we walk in love we walk in Grace we here's another thing that brother brandham emphasized over and over I I I almost feel like I wish I would have kept the quotes but then the other side of me says No tell them to go hear the message go back and read it again because here is a big one this is a this might this might be as big as brother brandham starting out with the fundamentals of knowing who you are and you only know who you are because you know who he is and you understand that he is his word and you understand that you love it and you're eating on it therefore you are it and second only to that is that you have to resist fear and doubt amen you've got to get rid of it friends fear is such an effective block of God's promises in your life amen I thought Lord how can I say that so plain and that's what I wrote Fear is such an effective block it is so effective it will keep you from realizing any promise of God Amen if you let fear and doubt because of the circumstance or but you say well but i' I've got guilt with then get rid of it well but i' I've got this carnality well then get rid of it so well I got a problem then stop get rid of the problem see like they say don't do that amen oh friends when when when fear Rises brother I brother brandham talks about complexes and he said the only way to defeat a complex fortunately the only way happens to be the best way so I'm glad it's if you say we only got one way yeah but it happens to be the best take the opposite amen take take the opposite amen it listen if if you've got something you're offering me that I'd like to have it's no good if unless I take it and and and and if you're holding something of mine that belongs to me and you won't give it to me I'm taking it and the devil would love to hold back the promises of God but brother brandham shows how Jesus took all of his weapons and the only weapon he has if he can get you to doubt your weapon I'm not doubting anymore my weapons I'm going to claim the promise of God and I'm going to change my confession to reflect my faith see you're walking conundrum if your if your confession doesn't match your your your faith you're you're trying to you're you're basically living a lie I just say this when fear arises take the opposite say what's the opposite of of fear uh take the take the opposite by replacing that fear with faith amen well how do I even do that well it starts right here yes amen of the abundance of the heart doth the mouth Speak oh yeah amen amen Amen brother Joe and I were fellowshipping on that the other day brother Joe sent me an article I haven't gotten to read it yet brother Joe but I was testifying to some of the brothers here just a couple of the ministers the other day and and it's it's done by Richard Dawkins who's the famous atheist and he's actually talking about you know DNA and genes your genes human genes and he says it's amazing even science knows that genes are almost like almost like Eternal almost like Immortal and he says you know all the way back generation after generation and that same characteristic of those genes just go from generation to generation to generation to generation I began to realize why it was so important for Matthew to to track Jesus through both Joseph and Mary although he was not the blood of either one of them but but humanly speaking he tracked both sides of Joseph and Mary all the way back and he goes 14 Generations all the way back to catches David Goes 14 more all the way back to Abraham I mean listen friends it was important that the people understand this Messiah is going to act like he's always acted all the way down since Genesis I'm here to tell I didn't start here I came from God and I'm going to act now like I acted then and Hallelujah because it's my privilege to act like that see and so I'm going to replace fear with faith and the reason I'm going to do that is because I can yes change your testimony cast down negative thoughts cast them down see brother brandom there's a quote I didn't pull it up tonight I thought about it stuck this in my notes in the back office there's a quote where I where uh brother uh the pastor in in Paris France and I was there at the meetings in Swansea preaching with him and uh he read a quote where brother brandham said you should never have a negative thought about anything don't let negative thoughts be in your mind you came from above he's the father of life in whom is no Shadow we're not here to have a negative thought I'm here to say I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me I don't need the devil's permission to get the Holy Ghost I don't need the devil's permission I don't need anybody's permission to be a Son of God I am entitled to be a Son of God I'm entitled I don't have to ask permission for perfect faith I don't have to beg God already has it and wants to operate it through me all I got to do is cast down imagination cast down carnality out of my life I'm already a Son of God that that's the part he did I'm already Born Again by the Holy Ghost that's the part he did I got one thing to do just one thing to do believe it and confess it and walk forward hallelujah oh my surely we can do our one thing friends got to act on your belief you believe it CU perfect Faith's not passive I said that to you very early on it's not passive it's perfect Faith compels action I I I was so inspired some weeks ago brother Caleb was preaching uh I think it was a Sunday school class I don't remember might have been on Wednesday night and he was talking about there that when you know when at the at the well when Rebecca comes out and there's eler and Rebecca didn't even realize there was there was an unseen realm in a world she couldn't see Angels moving and interdicting and she thought I'm just going to go out but it just so happened she went out at just the right time and it just so happened that she said the very words he had prayed and it just so happened that she she she was willing to be everything that that Abraham was looking for in a bride for his son I'm here to tell you something friends I I don't let the devil put you down you're everything that God is looking for in a to have a pred for his son if if that wasn't true he wouldn't have sent the message to you and and there's the point brother Caleb was making that Rebecca didn't even understand she was compelled to go out there some hidden Force compelled her it compelled her to walk up it compelled her to speak to him she was compelled she couldn't not do it and I'm here to tell you it's the way I want to be I want to say Lord God let there nothing in me I want to be compelled by the Living God I want it to move through my life see so when you have perfect Faith you act on it see you act on what you believe it's not it's not confident that that in yourself that you can do anything but you're perfectly satisfied that God will work through you amen perfect Faith isn't a pepper perfect Faith isn't me walking up to an immovable Mountain that I really need out of my way something going on in my home or my children or my family or my life or my body or my finances or whatever it is it isn't me going oh I'll tell you what bless God I'm I'm gonna take that Devil by the horns it has nothing to do with that Jesus never said bless God I'm gonna take that Devil by the horns Jesus just spoke brother Brown said he knew his words couldn't fail he knew who he was he said he never screamed at Devils he didn't have to said he just spoke come out of him see and and and and and so so we find then that it's not about me having some confidence I can do anything it's not me psyching myself up you know I might psych myself up if I'm a weightlifter because I'm G to psych myself up I'm going to you know you're you're psych yourself up to get your Gusto going to try to lift this weight you don't think you can lift it you're going to give it the old the old Notre Dame try and you're going to psych yourself up that's not what perfect faith is perfect faith is not a confidence that I can do anything but it is I am perfectly satisfied that God is ready to work through me amen he just needs me to speak it and believe it see so it's about taking your position amen that's what Joshua need needed you know when they were taking Jericho he gave everybody their marching orders here's where you need to be here's where you need to be and and we're going to have the singers we're going to have the musicians we going to have a worship team out in front of you guys the worship team's going into battle first because they're going to get the people ready and boy that's going to blow the enemy's mind when they see you surrounding Jericho with a bunch of singers and musicians amen and what in the world is going on we're getting the people ready getting the people ready we're marching to Zion beautiful beautiful Zion and then take your position around you and he said now this was important everybody take your position and stand get ready right there that piece of the wall is yours over there that's your brothers don't go trying to do his here's yours and he said when the when the trumpet blast he said then here's what I need you do everybody just shout hallelujah just shout amen just shout so be it Hallelujah and when they when the trumpet sounded and the people shouted earthquake hit the wall fell and and Joshua said all right just go up and just go forward to the to right to where your wall it'll fall in front of you go in and and do what you got to do in your area I I hope tonight you're hearing the voice of our Joshua who is the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and he's saying to you this is what you need to do Hold Your Position in the word of God and March forward see brother brandham says it like this oh my I got to hurry so he says this is the one quote I I that survived my my taking the quotes out because I want you to go get them yourself this is paragraph 43 if you had perfect faith I left this one in here because I want to take up a certain subject if you had perfect Faith you'd look right straight to God and believe it and walk away amen you would have no need of coming into a prayer line right you would have no need of these things because your faith has done made it so amen see so now you know there there's this there's this nonsense idea that we shouldn't have prayer lines although Jesus had them and brother brandham had them and it's it's crazy that we're having to feel like we got to defend something when we're just doing what Christ did and doing what a prophet did amen but and so he so so I I want to break this down for you because this is exactly where Peter had arrived Peter had got to the point where his faith in the words of the Lord was his everything here he is on a boat the stormy sea it's swamping and they're going to they're going to they're they're going to die and here comes Jesus walking on top of H2O amen well that's quite impossible but do you still believe it come on y'all it's impossible you actually believe Jesus was walking on top of the water you understand that breaks the laws of physics and you still believe it you guys are strange you believe it wow I feel the Holy Spirit going ask him again you'll get the same answer every time you ask them amen amen you know I want to say that when Peter saw him and he he cries out Lord if that's you then bid me to break the laws of physics amen you know it's interesting people say see brother brandham says we shouldn't have prayer lines we should have perfect faith we shouldn't have prayer lines and I'm just wondering if the people who are complaining about that stuff have even dealt with the malice that's in their own heart and all the nonsense they need to get rid and stop criticizing people who are just trying to serve God and help other people see and then they want to talk about perfect faith I doubt they've ever operated a day in their life right cuz now I know what perfect Faith won't operate through and it won't operate through that see and so so first of all you know when Peter arrived his he I mean he didn't have time for a prayer line so what brother brandham I'm trying to make the point here's the point I want to make brother brandham is not issuing a Prohibition against prayer lines he's just simply trying to make a point about perfect faith you'll get into a situation where you can't even where you're not having a prayer line and you don't even have the way to have a prayer line that's where Peter was he's in a boat he don't have a prayer line going he don't even have the facility to even hold a prayer line he's climbing out of a boat onto a Raging Sea to break the law of physics how's he going to have a prayer line see yeah so it's not about a Prohibition on prayer lines and that is let me just say with all the love I can muster that is such a childish way to look at that quote that is such a childish way it's just a prayer line as I said in our camp it's just an organizing tool to help facilitate an atmosphere and an expectation and an opportunity for for for a person who has called on the Elders of the church to have an opportunity to have a little bit of one-on-one contact amen see that's what brother Brandon would do he he was a prophet he said I'm he let me talk to you I'm contacting your spirit I'm not a prophet but that doesn't mean I can't stand there and let a brother or sister open their heart and say this is what I need and then now I got it and the man beside me's got it and the man of God over here's got it we're going to lay hands and now we know what devil we're casting out see so it's not about a Prohibition it's it's you know Satan has been so successful in causing a controversy where none should exist you know Peter you know Peter Peter didn't need a prayer line can I say it that way Peter didn't need a prayer line he didn't need one not only did Peter not need a prayer line Peter didn't need to be prayed for right Peter didn't need to pray amen Jesus didn't say uh Peter go pray first right Jesus didn't say Peter we better call a prayer line Peter you better hold up you better get down on your knees but you know what Jesus has said to him come that's it friends Oh my he just said come the problem the problem developed not with Jesus you see there there's a law of physics that a human can't walk on top of water but Faith disregards the laws of nature the Heavenly kingdom is not bound by the laws of of this Earth what happened is Peter began to look at the circumstances Jesus never changed what he said he just said come and Peter started coming he started defying the laws of physics until he started doing what putting his eyes on the circumstances around him and then you know what happened he became an obstacle to the supernatural powers that were bypassing physics and he began to sink naturally yeah see naturally this the sleeping Saints for hundreds of years can't come out of the Grave we're not talking about a natural event we're talking about a supernatural event naturally I can't change my body but supernaturally I'm going to be changed naturally I can't get rid of a sinful nature but supernaturally I can see so he didn't stop believing in the Lord he didn't stop believing the word see and and so so he he turned his attention to the circumstances and uh you know you know what you know what happened to Peter that I hope don't happen to you when you're right in the middle of needing to operate perfect Faith you know what happened to Peter Satan managed to get him to come to his senses bro you can't walk on water what are you doing Satan Satan literally got him to come to his senses the laws of physics this won't support a human being you see it proves that Peter was beyond his human senses amen Peter was faith in the word of God Jesus said come and he he didn't wait for a prayer line he didn't wait to go pray he didn't need anyone to pray for him he just stepped out of the boat if you're if you're on a Raging Sea like that yeah and you ain't got time for a prayer line then don't have one good news brother brandham said perfect Faith won't even need one amen hallelujah Hallelujah friends that's what I'm looking for I'm looking for perfect Faith where we have a prayer line if we need it but I don't have one if I don't need it Hallelujah there someday some glorious day we're not going to need a prayer line we're not going to need prayer we're not going to need any kind of thing like that the redeemed of the Lord are going to inherit the earth oh my see so so Peter effectively hindered that Supernatural flow that's what happened see Jesus after that event Jesus still held prayer lines and Peter helped him in them brother B called him campaigns and Jesus praying for the sick see so so it's not about that there's this you know there there there's an ever increasing challenge as we see that great day approaching where where we we're facing things friends where you may not have the time to go get prayed up or somebody pray for you or have a prayer line the world is falling apart I'm glad we can have a camp and structure it and plan for it and prepare for it and sing and get ready and line people up that's great but I'm here to tell you out on the streets in this mad world we don't have time to organize a prayer line you need to have perfect Faith ready to go you need and say how do I have it you have no condemnation how do I have it you have a clear heart in a mind toward God how do I have it you're confessing Faith how do I have it you're throwing down all doubt how do I have it I'm living a clean life before God I'm drank the sincere milk I'm eating on the fresh kill see so so this is exactly then you know to to organize your life in such a way today so that you know so that tomorrow that's your best way to overcome young people listen you want to be an overcomer tomorrow amen now you adults hold up these young people had plenty of amens at the at the Youth Camp I want to hear some of those kind of amens young people who were at the Youth Camp you want to have success tomorrow three all the young people that were the Camp stand up if you're at the camp stand up amen amen all right amen you want to have success tomorrow amen amen amen amen all right just making sure you still alive sit down here's how you have success tomorrow organize your life today make your life a make your life like an organized prayer line an organized prayerline we we we go into meticulous detail so that we can pray for everybody and we don't wear at that's why we do it the way we do it we want those young people to have some time to pour their heart out we want to have we don't want to have one preacher praying for everybody till he's dead and on oxygen and the back room so so that's why we set up five stations like that so we can it still takes as long to pray for them all because now we're giving them time but there's more value in it and that's just me brother Brandon done it both ways brother brandham held Gauntlet prayers where you just run through my Daddy went through a gauntlet prayer that's how I got healed hundreds of miles away healed instantly of an incurable blood disease cuz my dad was going through a prayer line where brother brandom said we don't have no way to set up a prayer line we can't we can't do it we don't have the room' so he says he lines the ministers up and puts them like a gauntlet and the people go through and my dad said preachers are just slapping everybody in Jesus name in Jesus name hallelujah praise the Lord bless him the Lord God and he said he gets right down to brother brandham and brother brandham is doing the same thing he's not stopping anybody until brother Eddie gets there you know why stopped brother Eddie because I needed to be standing here tonight to tell you about the glory of God hallelujah and he grabbed him he stop the line stop the line pulled him in said brother and my dad said he grabbed him by the arm stuck his finger in his face said you believe don't you son what do you think brother Eddie's going to say he said yes sir and he said all right at that instant I was healed at that instant friends I'm here to tell you perfect Faith Works it doesn't require you to be a Superman it just requires you to believe in a supernatural God hallelujah see so you can imagine then that that's exactly what Satan would do to break your concentration on believing the simple word of God so so you know I I just say we break that cycle I mean why not here we are do we want to get out of here we've been here more than half a century since a PR left I'd like to go home I'd like to get out of here I'd like to make I'd like to get on with the Millennium I said all time oh for the Millennium oh Hallelujah friends I say we break the cycle of doubt and fear I say we break the cycle of of carnality and sin in our life I say we break that cycle I don't care whatever generation has done this is a generation that's going home Hallelujah and that's what I want to be that's where I want to live I want to have perfect faith in a brother Bram said take perfect faith in a perfect God to keep a perfect promise Oh Glory to God I'm so glad for that Hallelujah I didn't get finished stand up God bless you I can't
