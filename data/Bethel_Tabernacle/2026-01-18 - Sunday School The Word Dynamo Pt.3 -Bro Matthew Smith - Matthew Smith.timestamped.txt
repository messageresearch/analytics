[5:43] Lord, I want to humbly invite you into
[5:45] our Sunday school service,
[5:48] Lord, that could step aside, that
[5:52] anything that would be a hindrance to
[5:54] you, Father, you would
[5:56] cast down, Lord, that we would open our
[5:58] hearts to you.
[6:01] Open our our minds, Father, for
[6:03] instruction,
[6:06] might learn something, gain some
[6:07] knowledge of your word, Father. But but
[6:09] above all, Lord, we like we want your
[6:11] spirit to move to anoint our hearts that
[6:15] we could you could draw closer to us and
[6:17] that we would draw closer to you.
[6:20] So, Father, we ask you be with us in
[6:22] this service, through the remainder of
[6:25] the the day, through the the the worship
[6:27] service and the ministry.
[6:31] We invite you here this morning and we
[6:33] trusting that you will meet us here
[6:36] knowing that you never miss your
[6:37] appointments.
[6:39] We ask this thing the name of the Lord
[6:43] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[6:45] Um we want to take a quick reading. Um
[6:50] and
[6:52] we want to read um Acts chapter 1.
[6:57] Um Acts chapter 1 and verse 6.
[7:04] I'll wait for you guys to turn. Um I'm
[7:07] going to just continue the thought that
[7:10] I' I'd um been um speaking on. Um
[7:14] I don't know what parts probably part
[7:16] three. I think the title I took was the
[7:18] word dynamo.
[7:20] Um and um this probably part three I
[7:22] think. So this is Acts chapter 1 and
[7:25] verse 6. It says when they therefore
[7:27] were come together they asked of him
[7:29] saying Lord wilt thou at this time
[7:31] restore again the kingdom to Israel? And
[7:33] he said unto them, it is not for you to
[7:35] know the times or the seasons which the
[7:38] Father hath put in his own power, but ye
[7:40] shall receive power after that that the
[7:43] Holy Ghost has come upon upon you, and
[7:45] ye shall be witnesses unto me both in
[7:47] Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[7:49] Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of
[7:51] the earth. Y'all can be seated. Um
[7:56] so um for a recap for anyone who wasn't
[7:59] here or just forgot um the sort of the
[8:03] the
[8:05] core of my thought here is um that
[8:08] here's in in Acts chapter one you have
[8:10] Jesus talking about um how the people
[8:13] would receive the the the saints would
[8:15] receive um power um through the Holy
[8:18] Ghost on the day of Pentecost.
[8:21] And we also read in um I believe it's
[8:24] sec yeah second Peter chapter 1 um where
[8:26] Peter lays out uh what we what we refer
[8:29] to as the statue of the perfect man um
[8:31] you know talking about adding to add to
[8:33] your faith virtue add to your virtue
[8:34] knowledge add to and so on and there's a
[8:39] a quote from the message statue of
[8:41] perfect man where brother Brandham
[8:43] directly links that where he says um
[8:46] then to your faith add virtue. Now right
[8:48] there knocks a lot of us down. Yes, sir.
[8:51] Add virtue to your faith. That doesn't
[8:52] just mean living a virgin life, you
[8:54] know, like the woman or a man and so
[8:56] forth. That doesn't have nothing to do
[8:57] with that. The Bible said, we read over
[8:59] here in the book of Luke where it said
[9:02] virtue went out of him. Is that right?
[9:04] If we're going to be like him, we must
[9:05] have virtue. Then we must have it to be
[9:08] like him. And so
[9:13] um so here's brother Brandham directly,
[9:17] you know, showing how making this
[9:19] reference here about the statue of the
[9:20] perfect man that if you're going to be
[9:21] like Christ, if you're going to be in
[9:22] the statue of the perfect man, there
[9:24] must be virtue like Christ had virtue in
[9:28] order to be a Christian. Right? If
[9:29] you're going to be a a Christian, a real
[9:32] Christian, then then that means that
[9:33] you're going to be Christlike. And
[9:35] that's what the word Christian means is
[9:36] that to be like Christ. And if you're
[9:38] going to be like Christ, that must mean
[9:39] that you have to have virtue like Christ
[9:41] had virtue. And the way Christ had
[9:43] virtue was not simply
[9:46] not, you know, not to say that it wasn't
[9:47] a a godly or what brother Brandon refers
[9:50] to here as a virgin lifestyle, but
[9:52] rather that it was a reference he
[9:54] referenced here
[9:57] uh where Jesus said that virtue had gone
[9:59] out of him. Well, if we follow that back
[10:01] and and go read in the gospels that
[10:04] story where Jesus is, you know, in the
[10:07] crowd and the and the woman with the
[10:08] issue of blood um touches him in the
[10:10] crowd and he says, "Who touched me?" And
[10:12] and you know, they say, "You obviously,
[10:14] you know, there's a crowd around you.
[10:15] Why why are you saying who touched you?"
[10:16] And he said, "But I perceive virtue went
[10:18] out of me." We're all familiar with the
[10:19] story. Well, that word virtue in the
[10:21] gospels,
[10:23] the word virtue translates back to the
[10:26] Greek, the original Greek word is um
[10:30] the word dynamon.
[10:33] Um and it is um
[10:38] would translate more more uh to English
[10:41] as um uh force or miraculous power. And
[10:48] so when Jesus is saying that virtue went
[10:50] out of him, what he's saying there more
[10:53] uh more perfectly translated would be um
[10:56] that he felt miraculous power um leave
[10:59] his body. And so just kind of summing
[11:03] all that up, brother Brandham here is
[11:05] saying if you're going to be a Christian
[11:07] like Christ was a Christian, right?
[11:08] Okay, if you're going to be be
[11:09] Christlike, if you're going to be a real
[11:11] Christian and truly be Christlike, then
[11:13] that requires you to have
[11:16] power operating in your life the way
[11:18] Christ had power operating in his life.
[11:20] Okay. Um it it it's not um just simply,
[11:26] you know, putting coming to a church.
[11:27] It's not, you know, identifying yourself
[11:29] with a particular religion or a
[11:31] particular group. It is um nothing short
[11:35] of allowing the spirit of God to operate
[11:38] through you and to work um in the world
[11:42] through an actual supernatural power.
[11:46] And if that supernatural power is
[11:47] missing from your life, then there's
[11:49] there's a problem, right? Then you know
[11:51] you you you have not added virtue to
[11:54] your faith as you know as Peter taught.
[11:58] um you you cannot build the statue of
[12:00] perfect man without the supernatural
[12:02] power as one of the foundational planks.
[12:05] And so um we also talked about how just
[12:09] scientifically um you know this word um
[12:15] uh dynamon is the you know the Greek
[12:18] root for where we get the word dynamo
[12:20] which is a a um electricity generating
[12:23] machine right whether it's a big power
[12:25] plant or just a little polestar
[12:27] generator they're all a form of a dynamo
[12:29] and it's coming from that same original
[12:31] Greek idea of force or power. Now, in
[12:35] the scientific world, we're talking
[12:37] about generators. We measure this the
[12:39] capacity of a generator or how much
[12:41] power a generator outputs. Um, in um we
[12:46] use the the word scientifically, we use
[12:47] the word power to describe the output
[12:50] capacity of a generator and that's
[12:52] measured in watts or kilowatts or
[12:54] megawws if if you're talking about
[12:56] something real big. Um, and what that is
[12:58] scientifically is it's not just simply a
[13:01] a measure of energy, right? Like energy
[13:03] would be like how much heat you can get
[13:06] out of a out of fuel or something like
[13:08] that. But power is how much
[13:12] um we could say how much actual effect
[13:16] this machine can have on the real world,
[13:18] right? Um sort of an analogy that I took
[13:20] was that if you know the amount of
[13:24] energy a truck has is how much fuel is
[13:26] in the tank, how much power it has is
[13:28] how big of a load it can haul, right?
[13:30] Same thing with a generator. If you've
[13:32] got, you know, 30 kilowatts coming out
[13:35] of a generator, that's a direct measure
[13:37] of how many electric motors this thing
[13:39] can run, how many light bulbs it can
[13:41] turn on, how many pieces of equipment
[13:43] can operate off of this, how many
[13:44] appliances can run, how many air
[13:45] conditionings can it air conditioners
[13:47] can it power up. That's all it's the
[13:50] capacity to do work in the real world.
[13:53] So likewise, you know, we look at um you
[13:58] know, if if you want to see the the
[14:00] measure of the power of God in your
[14:02] life, it's not just simply how excited
[14:04] you are, right? It's not how high you
[14:09] jump and up and down in church. It's not
[14:11] how loud you shout amen. Those are all
[14:12] good things. Nobody is is telling you
[14:14] not to do those things. Those are all
[14:16] very good things, right? But at some
[14:19] level it has to come down to what does
[14:22] your lifestyle look like? What is the if
[14:25] the power of God is operating in your
[14:27] life it is affecting change in the world
[14:31] through you in your life with your hands
[14:34] doing it is God operating through you
[14:37] and if it's not then there's not any
[14:38] real power there right and I I took like
[14:42] I said I'm a um the reason why I'm
[14:44] taking that kind of the analogy of the
[14:45] of the of the dynamo of the generator is
[14:47] because that's what I do every day I'm a
[14:48] mechanic I work on generators um and you
[14:52] know so we can draw some analogy there.
[14:54] Now, one of the things that I uh
[14:57] mentioned last and I thought it was so
[14:58] perfect um the way it just the timing
[15:01] the Lord's timing was so beautiful um in
[15:03] this um where you know I I had mentioned
[15:06] last last time I I did Sunday school um
[15:09] that just talking about how uh like I
[15:13] said before you know you can have a big
[15:15] a big energetic church service right a
[15:17] lot of people jumping up and down a lot
[15:19] of people you know shouting and and
[15:21] hollering and and like I said not not
[15:23] bad I I have no uh nothing against any
[15:26] of that um per se, but if that's the
[15:30] extent of your experience, if it if it
[15:32] never goes beyond
[15:35] excitement at church,
[15:37] &gt;&gt; then you there's no real power there. Um
[15:40] it's not really doing anything. And it,
[15:44] you know, you can because if all we're
[15:46] looking for, if the extent of the of
[15:47] the, you know, air quotes power of the
[15:49] spirit is simply to make you excited,
[15:52] well, you can get the exact same effect
[15:54] at a rock concert. You can get the exact
[15:56] same effect at a ball game.
[15:59] You know, I was not always a good
[16:00] Christian boy and there were many times
[16:02] I've been to rock concerts and let me
[16:03] tell you, they will get you in a in a
[16:05] particular atmosphere, right? They you
[16:07] you become emotionally engaged in what's
[16:09] going on there. Um, you can see it when
[16:12] when an entire auditorium full of people
[16:15] gets in one mind and one accord and they
[16:17] are all focused on what's happening on
[16:20] that stage and they're all in tune with
[16:22] the music and it there's a there is a a
[16:25] a unifying that takes place there. Um
[16:29] and
[16:30] what happens you know so me I you know
[16:33] with educational background that I have
[16:34] um was was blessed with um one of the
[16:40] things that I a class that I was
[16:41] required to take in college it wouldn't
[16:42] have been my choice um but I was
[16:44] required to take a class an anthropology
[16:46] class and the only at that point only
[16:49] class available to me at that time was a
[16:52] um class called the anthropology of
[16:56] magic and religion. in
[16:59] and they go through all like the world
[17:01] religions and the idea is just basically
[17:02] give you an overview of what are all the
[17:04] cultural beliefs of all the various
[17:05] major world religions. Um and the you
[17:07] know the the professor was like we're
[17:09] they didn't really focus on Christianity
[17:10] much just because you know you're in
[17:11] America you're all familiar with
[17:13] Christianity. You already know what that
[17:14] is. Um but what is what do what do the
[17:16] Muslims believe? Actually most of y'all
[17:18] most people haven't really had any real
[17:20] serious direct contact with Muslims to
[17:22] really know what they believe. um uh or
[17:26] or even like um uh so you know or Hindus
[17:29] you know you don't really you know you
[17:31] see a couple Hindus from time to time
[17:33] but you don't really you know there's
[17:34] not you're not really familiar with what
[17:36] they believe so you know they they kind
[17:37] of did a lot of that but then they cut
[17:38] got all the way around and said you know
[17:40] at the end of the day take something
[17:42] like um like uh the African practice of
[17:46] hudu or um even like the um sort of
[17:50] central American um practice like
[17:52] Santaia
[17:53] or like the um
[17:57] um like the the the Norse like the pagan
[17:59] European pagan stuff or the Native
[18:01] American religions or all these
[18:03] different pl all these sort of
[18:06] you know for lack of a better word sort
[18:08] of um I don't want to say primitive but
[18:11] anyways like you we all know what we're
[18:12] talking about like the African the
[18:14] African religions things like that um
[18:15] native you know you know bush bush
[18:17] religions um these all almost
[18:20] universally fall under a blanket
[18:21] category called category called shaman
[18:23] ism
[18:25] and we as Christians we would look at a
[18:28] lot of that stuff and say well that's
[18:29] witchcraft and you're not necessarily
[18:30] wrong but to the people of the land
[18:34] that's their religion that's just what
[18:35] they believe right they believe in in
[18:36] gods and spirits and things like that
[18:38] and they believe they communicate with
[18:39] their gods and spirits through their
[18:40] various practices
[18:42] and so that's kind of why it's in in a
[18:44] religion class right what we think of as
[18:46] as witchcraft is sort of their religion
[18:49] it's what they believe
[18:52] Well, so they they kind of did this big
[18:55] overview of shamanism because it pretty
[18:57] much every continent, every culture,
[18:59] every group, every every people on the
[19:02] earth, if you run their c their their
[19:03] religions, their native religions back,
[19:05] they almost all land in in some form of
[19:08] shamanism. And we can put them all in
[19:11] one box. There's a lot of key things
[19:13] that are similar that unite all these
[19:16] religions together.
[19:18] One of them is just sort of a belief
[19:19] that there's all these like natural
[19:21] spirits, whether it's your ancestors or
[19:23] nature or, you know, animals and plants
[19:26] or the earth itself or whatever. There's
[19:27] some sort of spirits in the world. And
[19:29] that this shaman, this guy, he's going
[19:32] to he's going to um do some ritual and
[19:35] he's going to allow those spirits to
[19:37] communicate through him to the people.
[19:40] That's kind of the fundamentals of
[19:41] shamanism. and they're going to do this
[19:44] and they're they universally all of them
[19:48] have a unifying
[19:50] fundamental
[19:52] um plank to the way they're going to do
[19:53] this and that is through the use of
[19:57] rhythm music all of them they all
[20:00] whether it's a Native American beating a
[20:02] ton whether it's a African beating a
[20:05] drum or a Cambodian guy re shaking bells
[20:09] whatever it is whatever the sham
[20:10] wherever you go in the
[20:12] The shaman uses rhythm to enter a trance
[20:16] to communicate with the spirit world.
[20:17] That's what they do.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Um and
[20:23] um now most of the time they also use
[20:26] some drugs to do that too, but that's
[20:28] neither here nor there. Um but the point
[20:30] is you have you have some shaman who's
[20:31] kind of leading this operation. Then you
[20:32] have all the people around them who are
[20:34] kind of uh taking part in this though
[20:36] not necessarily participating and
[20:38] they're listening to the music. They're
[20:40] waiting for him because he's going to be
[20:41] this portal to the spirit world that's
[20:43] going to tell them what what they need
[20:45] to know, whether he's going to give them
[20:47] some sort of prophecy or whatever.
[20:50] And
[20:52] what we can do scientifically, so
[20:54] there's a whole, you know, scientists
[20:56] were really interested about this like,
[20:57] wait a minute, why is it that all these
[20:58] religions do this? What is the effect
[21:00] that this practice this this because you
[21:02] have all these independent cultures all
[21:04] developing the same thing all at once
[21:06] and all together. Why why is this? Well,
[21:09] one of the things they found out is that
[21:11] rhythm, rhythmic
[21:13] music, right? So, drumming specifically,
[21:15] anything with percussion rhythm, one of
[21:18] the things that it does is it um adjusts
[21:20] your heart rate to fall in line with the
[21:23] rhythm. Um it will literally your heart
[21:26] rate will will change to match the
[21:28] rhythm of the music that you're
[21:30] listening to.
[21:32] And they also found that the rhythm of
[21:34] the music, whatever shamanistic religion
[21:37] that you're talking about, they all
[21:39] their their rhythm, their drumming or
[21:41] their their whatever rhythm, because not
[21:43] all of them use a drum, but you get my
[21:44] point, whatever whatever their
[21:46] percussion instrument is,
[21:48] all of it falls within a particular
[21:51] narrow beats per minute band, right?
[21:54] It's a it's a specific thing. Okay? So
[21:58] what they found is that there is some
[22:00] sort of physiological effect on your
[22:03] body that the the music that a shaman
[22:05] plays to bring people into a spiritual
[22:08] state of mind literally has a medical
[22:11] effect on your body. It medically
[22:14] affects your mind and it literally gets
[22:17] everyone who's listening it to sync
[22:19] their heart rates and get everyone in
[22:21] one mind and one accord.
[22:23] That is what and in doing that in doing
[22:26] that okay it
[22:30] you know because again the principle and
[22:33] I and I'll say this
[22:36] um I say all this to because because I
[22:38] want to I want to make a point here
[22:39] right my point isn't that you know all
[22:42] I'm not advocating I'm going to go do p
[22:44] practice some shamanism by no means um
[22:47] the point here is that you know we we
[22:51] talk about physics in the world, right?
[22:54] There's physics. I can I if there's an
[22:56] object here, I could push it and it
[22:57] would fall, right? Gravity exists. We
[22:59] you know, you throw something up the
[23:01] air, what goes up must come down. Um,
[23:03] you know, for we we understand how the
[23:05] physical world moves and objects
[23:07] interact with each other.
[23:09] But there's a spiritual world as well,
[23:12] and that spiritual world has physics,
[23:14] too,
[23:15] &gt;&gt; right? There's a physics. I mean, it's
[23:17] beyond what we really comprehend, but
[23:19] there's there's rules and and and and
[23:24] for lack of a better word, scientific
[23:27] laws in the spirit world just like there
[23:29] is in the physical world, right? And the
[23:32] the laws of the physical world are not
[23:34] there's no morality associated with them
[23:37] per se, right? The same laws of physics
[23:39] that, you know, make a firearm operate
[23:42] so you can shoot a deer and feed your
[23:43] family are the same laws of physics that
[23:46] operate for some criminal to shoot an
[23:48] innocent person. Okay? There's no it's
[23:50] the same laws of physics. It's it's all
[23:52] sort of it's the it's a tree of
[23:54] knowledge, both good and evil, right?
[23:56] The same laws of physics that can make a
[23:58] power plant, power your home, make a
[24:00] bomb that can blow up your home. It's
[24:02] all it's it's just it's sort of morally
[24:06] neutral laws that that function. The
[24:08] same thing happens in the spiritual
[24:10] world, right? Being in one mind and one
[24:12] accord doesn't make you good.
[24:15] It just makes you unified. It means that
[24:18] you have power. Power is not necessarily
[24:22] just the notion of power isn't
[24:24] necessarily make doesn't just make you
[24:26] good. It you know righteous. It makes
[24:28] you powerful. It's not the it's not the
[24:31] same thing. Um,
[24:34] you know, the we look at the Tower of
[24:36] Babel. The people at the Tower of Babel
[24:38] were united. They were in one mind and
[24:39] one accord. They had a united language.
[24:41] They were they were so one with one
[24:44] another that even God himself, Jehovah,
[24:48] looked and said, "I can't stop them.
[24:51] Whatever they're going to do, they're
[24:53] going to do it unless I break their
[24:55] unity." Okay? So here you have wicked
[24:58] people using the laws of the spiritual
[25:00] world to be powerful in a in an
[25:04] unrighteous way.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[25:07] The same thing happens
[25:10] the exact same thing happens or I or I
[25:13] let me just say it like this. If the the
[25:16] the
[25:19] you know wicked people can become
[25:21] unified can get into one mind and one
[25:22] accord can use music right. I mean, talk
[25:27] to talk to some missionaries, talk to
[25:28] some people who have experienced some of
[25:30] these um shamanistic uh rituals and
[25:33] things. They'll tell you there's some
[25:35] power that can go on there,
[25:37] &gt;&gt; right? People doing superhuman things
[25:39] that, you know, that's not, you know,
[25:41] talk to Brother Jason. Brother Jason's
[25:43] mentioned it over the pulpit several
[25:44] times. You know, some of the things that
[25:45] he's seen in in Africa and whatnot, some
[25:47] of the rituals that he's that he's
[25:48] observed. um you know these these are
[25:52] you know I've talked to various other
[25:53] ministers um and missionaries and things
[25:55] whatnot people have seen this stuff and
[25:57] it it's it it is a supernatural power
[26:00] there and it's but it because they're
[26:03] tapping into sort of the the the physics
[26:06] of the spiritual world. It's not a um
[26:10] doesn't make any of that stuff
[26:12] righteous. It just makes it powerful.
[26:15] And the same way in the same way
[26:20] that you know um I I should have put it
[26:24] in my notes and I and I didn't. Um I
[26:26] believe it's in spoken word's original
[26:28] seed where brother Brandham talks about
[26:29] how the last day referring to how it
[26:32] would be so close as deceive the very
[26:33] elect if it were possible. And he was
[26:34] literally referring to supernatural
[26:36] vindications. And he talked about how at
[26:38] the last day you would have you would
[26:40] have the nominal Christian world have
[26:42] signs and wonders operating amongst
[26:43] them. That it would be the real deal
[26:45] supernatural operating, but it wouldn't
[26:47] be the spirit of God.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; It'd be the power of Satan operating in
[26:50] their church and people would be drawn
[26:52] to that because they would see something
[26:53] supernatural and think that's God. It
[26:56] must be. But it's literally the power of
[26:58] Satan. And he said the only way you
[26:59] would know the difference is you have to
[27:00] bring it back to the word test. If you
[27:03] want to find the quote, look up the
[27:04] phrase the word test. Okay? you bring it
[27:07] back to the word test because
[27:10] the the if if what they're doing if the
[27:12] supernatural power on display is not in
[27:15] the line in the order of God's word,
[27:17] then it can't be God, right? There has
[27:19] to be there's there's there's an actual
[27:22] um
[27:24] uh there's criteria there, right?
[27:26] There's there's things that are in
[27:27] place, ways for you to know that it's
[27:29] whether it's God or not. Um, one thing
[27:32] that specifically in in the quote that
[27:34] I'm thinking of right now, um, Brother
[27:36] Brandham said that one of the ways that
[27:37] you would know is that there would be no
[27:39] divine healing because Satan cannot cast
[27:41] out Satan,
[27:42] &gt;&gt; right? That they would do all kinds of
[27:43] supernatural things, but they would be
[27:45] lacking true divine healing. Um,
[27:49] so, you know, just the these are things
[27:52] that I, you know, I feel that we're
[27:54] towards the end times. I think we're
[27:55] we're running towards the end of all of
[27:57] this and and these are things that we
[27:58] have to bear in mind as we see the world
[28:00] around us becoming more and more
[28:02] religious as we see um you know and and
[28:06] it's shocking you look at the at the
[28:08] younger generations young people people
[28:10] you know young men under 30 is are
[28:14] flocking back to church it is go go look
[28:19] at some of the the the statistics out
[28:21] there they you know there various
[28:23] research groups like Pew Research and
[28:24] different ones
[28:25] that do cultural surveys of of the
[28:27] younger generations and and you know
[28:30] religiously
[28:32] um young men and increasingly young
[28:34] women. It's not less so amongst young
[28:36] women, but it's increasingly going that
[28:37] direction as well with amongst young
[28:39] women. Um but young men in particular
[28:42] are
[28:43] um probably one of the most um
[28:45] conservative and religious generations
[28:47] of young people since the 1940s.
[28:51] Okay. Your typical young man today is is
[28:54] far more religious than their parents
[28:57] are typic by by statistically, right? Um
[29:01] many many young men are going back to
[29:03] church where they're where they were
[29:04] raised atheist. They were, you know,
[29:05] raised, you know, nothing, you know, or
[29:07] or if they were it was a sort of a, you
[29:09] know, Christmas and Easter kind of
[29:10] religion if they had any religion at
[29:12] all. But now they're very devout.
[29:13] They're very traditional, very hardline
[29:16] in what they believe. Um, so as we see
[29:20] the world going in that direction, as
[29:22] we're seeing, you know, things shift
[29:25] that way, bear in mind,
[29:28] um,
[29:29] you know, it's going to be deceptive.
[29:32] What what's coming, don't be surprised
[29:35] if you start seeing signs and wonders
[29:37] operate in the nominal Christian world.
[29:39] Don't be surprised. Don't be surprised
[29:41] if you start seeing supernatural things
[29:43] because that's there. That is the devil
[29:45] literally trying to create something
[29:47] because so many people who are in it for
[29:50] fishes and loaves. So many people whose
[29:54] only real relationship with the message
[29:57] of the hour was that brother Brandham
[29:58] did some miracles one time.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Right? That's the extent of their
[30:02] revelation is that well I know this is
[30:04] true because brother Brandham did some
[30:05] miracles. If that's the ext if that's
[30:08] your the the foundation of your
[30:09] revelation friends you better really get
[30:11] serious right? You better really know
[30:13] what you believe. You better get into
[30:15] the word and really understand. Put what
[30:17] you believe to the word test. Do you
[30:19] believe it because it's the truth? Do
[30:21] you believe it because it's it lines up
[30:22] with the word of God? Or do you believe
[30:24] it because,
[30:26] you know, it because it's what you were
[30:29] raised to believe? Do you believe it
[30:30] because, you know,
[30:33] there was some supernatural things one
[30:34] time? You know, because if that's the
[30:37] extent of it, listen,
[30:39] you know, the Bible talks about how
[30:41] Jesus gave power unto the 12 that
[30:45] included Judas,
[30:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Okay. There were there was m there was
[30:50] healing done at the hands of Judas a
[30:52] scariot.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; Okay. Don't just because there's
[30:56] supernatural associated with it does not
[30:58] mean
[31:00] that it's a it's a it's a it's a um you
[31:04] know that it's in line with the word of
[31:06] God necessarily. Be careful in this day
[31:09] and age. Know what you believe. Learn
[31:11] the word. Be educated in the word.
[31:14] Remember what we said. Add to your faith
[31:17] virtue in this context. Add to your
[31:19] faith uh power but add to your power
[31:22] knowledge.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; Right? Don't stop there. There's a lot
[31:25] more to the statue of a perfect man than
[31:27] just belief and and supernatural, right?
[31:31] You you need to have knowledge. There is
[31:33] there's actually godly knowledge. We
[31:35] don't you know there knowledge doesn't
[31:37] save you. Knowledge doesn't redeem you,
[31:40] but it sure does make it and like I'll
[31:43] use this example as I'm as I'm wrapping
[31:45] up here. amount of time, you know, um
[31:49] you get people who get all uh energized,
[31:52] you know, and a lot of faith and say,
[31:54] "Well, you know, when the devil comes
[31:55] against you, just speak with faith. It
[31:58] is written." Well, it would really hope
[32:00] help if you knew what was written,
[32:03] &gt;&gt; right? You actually have to know because
[32:06] remember if you read if you read Matthew
[32:08] chapter 4
[32:10] in there when Jesus in the wilderness
[32:12] and Satan is coming to him and saying
[32:13] you know tempting him the sec because
[32:16] there's three times Satan came to him
[32:17] the first time he you know um with uh
[32:21] tempting him to to use his power to make
[32:22] bread the second and Jesus said it is
[32:24] written man shall not live by bread
[32:26] alone but then the second time uh Satan
[32:30] comes to him Satan came to Jesus and
[32:32] said it is written
[32:34] And Jesus responded, "It is also
[32:36] written." So if you don't if you have no
[32:39] knowledge of the word, if you're you are
[32:41] ignorant of the word, you you're you're
[32:43] so focused on on feelings and emotions
[32:45] and and and big church services and and
[32:48] energetic services that you never take
[32:50] the time to get godly teaching and
[32:51] instruction and get into your Bible and
[32:53] read the word and read the message and
[32:55] know where you stand and have some
[32:57] actual just fundamental education on
[33:00] these things. Then what will happen is
[33:02] the devil will come and drag you around
[33:05] &gt;&gt; with with you know some outof context
[33:07] scripture and will lead you into any
[33:09] you'll be blown around by every wind of
[33:11] false doctrine because you have no
[33:13] actual foundation in the word.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[33:17] &gt;&gt; So we'll stop there. We'll let's stand
[33:19] and have a quick word of prayer to end.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you for this
[33:27] this morning. Thank you for this time
[33:28] that we've been given Lord to
[33:32] focus on your word to maybe be maybe
[33:35] learn something maybe uh bring our minds
[33:39] close to your word that Lord that
[33:41] something that you would have for us
[33:44] would strike our hearts. Give us give us
[33:46] courage. Give us strength. Father give
[33:49] us another sharpen our swords just a
[33:51] little bit more that we could fight the
[33:52] devil a little bit better. Lord, we ask
[33:55] your your spirit would remain with us
[33:57] through the service. Be with us in the
[33:59] song service and in the ministering of
[34:00] the word
[34:02] throughout our days and weeks, Lord, be
[34:04] with us. We ask these things in the name
[34:06] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
