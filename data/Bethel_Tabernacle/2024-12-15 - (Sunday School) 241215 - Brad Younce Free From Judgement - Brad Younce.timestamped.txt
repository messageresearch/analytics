[0:00] good
[0:01] morning I he's happy to be
[0:04] here I'm definitely happy to be here
[0:06] let's all Stand Together have order of
[0:11] prayer father we just thank you for this
[0:13] opportunity we have to gather together
[0:14] once again father I just pray may you
[0:17] just be with this portion of the service
[0:19] Lord may you be with the words that was
[0:21] spoken be with the hearer father may you
[0:24] be with the the main service Lord be
[0:26] with our brother Lord we expect to hear
[0:28] from you today Father we just place this
[0:30] service into your hands in Jesus name
[0:33] amen um I want to read out of Romans
[0:36] chapter 8 verse 1 through
[0:41] 5 I'm going I'm going to try to to do a
[0:45] Sunday school this
[0:46] morning I'm not going to try to preach
[0:49] it I said try but we'll leave the
[0:53] preaching for the the man in the
[0:56] back but Romans 8 verse1 says there
[1:00] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:03] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[1:06] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:08] spirit for the law of the spirit of life
[1:11] in Christ Jesus hath made me free from
[1:14] the law of sin and death for what the
[1:17] law could not do in that it was weak
[1:19] through the flesh God sending his own
[1:22] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[1:25] for sin condemns sin in the flesh that
[1:28] the righteous of the law might be
[1:30] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:33] flesh but after the spirit for they that
[1:36] are after The Flesh do mind the things
[1:38] of the flesh but they that are after the
[1:40] spirit the things of the spirit may God
[1:43] add a blessings you have your seat for
[1:45] the tip that title I put free from
[1:49] judgment we're already
[1:51] judged you know I got to look at the
[1:54] scripture in in
[1:55] Romans and for some reason the last few
[1:58] weeks I just kept going back and forth
[2:00] between Romans 8 1 and then in into
[2:03] judge into Romans chapter 7 and I was
[2:06] like why why would Paul start this this
[2:10] chapter out therefore there is now no
[2:12] condemnation what brought him to that
[2:14] point so I was reading over into I
[2:16] backed it up into Romans 7 and I I want
[2:20] to go through Romans
[2:21] 7:14 through through the end of that
[2:24] chapter um I want to go back and forth
[2:26] between the King James and the NLT
[2:28] they'll have the King James up here but
[2:30] I thought it
[2:31] was it's a pretty way describes a a
[2:35] Christian today you know Paul he's he's
[2:38] having a struggle within himself you
[2:40] know battling the old nature with the
[2:42] new and you know we read these verses we
[2:46] have to remember Paul was converted he
[2:49] wasn't an unconverted Soul so just
[2:52] remember that we have this flesh we have
[2:54] to deal with so Romans 7:14 they should
[2:57] have it there for we know that that the
[3:00] law is spiritual but I am carnal sold
[3:03] under
[3:04] sin but the vers the other version say
[3:06] so the trouble is not with the law for
[3:09] it is spiritual and good the trouble is
[3:11] with me for I'm All Too Human a slave to
[3:16] sin how many how many humans we have
[3:19] here rest of you are
[3:22] angels this is not for you this is for
[3:25] us
[3:25] humans verse 7 7:15 says to that which I
[3:29] do allow not for what I would that I do
[3:32] not but what I hate that I do which is I
[3:35] don't really understand myself for I
[3:38] want to do what is right but I don't do
[3:40] it instead I do what I hate now this is
[3:44] not a uh get out of jail free
[3:48] card if you know what I mean this is not
[3:50] a freedom to sin this this these
[3:52] scriptures don't mean hey I can go out
[3:54] and D World and get drunk and but I got
[3:56] something down the inside of me if you
[3:57] got something real down the inside of
[3:59] you you won't go do those things but
[4:01] this is a battle that we have with our
[4:02] flesh and then I do that which I would
[4:05] not I consent unto the law that is good
[4:08] so but if I know that what I'm doing is
[4:10] wrong this shows that I agree that the
[4:12] law is good
[4:14] Hallelujah Romans 717 says but then it
[4:17] is no more
[4:19] I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
[4:24] he's not saying sin dwelleth in me he's
[4:26] just talking about the sin that he lives
[4:28] in this is what this this body body of
[4:30] sin because we know once we got saved
[4:31] this didn't get saved this is old sticky
[4:34] nature we live with this but what got
[4:36] saved was down the inside our
[4:38] soul now that is no more that I that do
[4:41] it but sin that dwelleth in me I'm not
[4:43] the one doing
[4:45] wrong thank the Lord he says I am not
[4:47] the one doing wrong it is a sin living
[4:51] that I live in that does it for I know
[4:53] that is in me that is in my flesh
[4:55] dwelleth no good thing that's right
[4:57] there's not a good thing that dwells in
[4:59] US amen this flesh anyway dwelleth no
[5:03] good thing for to will is to present
[5:06] with me the how to perform that which is
[5:08] good I find
[5:11] not I know there's nothing good that
[5:13] lives in me that is my sinful nature I
[5:16] want to do what is right but I can't
[5:20] he's not talking about the soul he's
[5:22] talking about this
[5:24] flesh the good that I would I do not but
[5:28] the evil which I would not that I do I
[5:32] want to do what is good but I
[5:36] don't I don't want to do what is wrong
[5:38] but I do it
[5:39] anyway we battle this thing yes I battle
[5:43] this thing on the way to church when
[5:45] somebody the speed limit says it's 55
[5:47] and they're going
[5:50] 40 I battle what's going on inside my
[5:54] flesh it's a constant War if I do that I
[5:58] would not it is no more either that do
[6:00] it but sin that dwelleth in me am so if
[6:03] I do what I don't want to do I I am not
[6:06] really the one doing it it is the sin
[6:08] that's living in me that doing
[6:10] it it's not remember it don't make you
[6:14] free from
[6:15] sin don't be you you still have you
[6:17] still have to battle this thing so then
[6:19] I find a law that when I would do good
[6:22] evil is present with
[6:25] me as long as we live in this body it is
[6:28] sin that's
[6:30] right for I Delight in the law of God
[6:33] but I see another law in my members
[6:36] warning against the law of my mind and
[6:39] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[6:41] sin which is in my members which means
[6:44] there's another power within me that is
[6:47] at war with my mind this power makes me
[6:51] a slave to sin that is
[6:54] still within
[6:56] me so he's saying there's still sin
[6:59] within me there's still sin within this
[7:02] body not in the soul but in this body so
[7:07] he's talking about a battle between the
[7:08] Flesh and the spirit you know you
[7:10] remember the story brother BR told about
[7:11] the old Indian
[7:13] chief you know two dogs are fighting he
[7:15] say how you doing Chief pretty good and
[7:19] pretty bad yeah a lot of times we're
[7:21] pretty bad
[7:22] right some say I'm pretty bad they've
[7:26] been pretty good well how what do you
[7:27] mean he says well see since I received
[7:30] the Holy Ghost there's been two dogs in
[7:33] me one black dog and one white dog and
[7:37] they argue all the time yeah they argue
[7:41] all the time it's like I don't feel like
[7:43] going to church yes you are you're
[7:46] getting up and you're going but I'm too
[7:47] tired but you're going anyway I'm I'm
[7:51] too tired to raise my hands when they
[7:52] say let's raise our hands and worship my
[7:54] arms are tired I'm not doing it yes you
[7:56] are there's a constant battle going on
[7:59] I'm going you're going to say this about
[8:01] somebody no you're not you're not going
[8:03] to
[8:05] gossip there's there's a battle going on
[8:08] they growl and fight at one
[8:10] another the white dog wants me to do
[8:12] good the black dog wants me to do bad
[8:15] well Chief which one of them wins the
[8:16] fight depends on which one Chief feeds
[8:19] the
[8:20] most and then Paul's you know he's like
[8:23] of all these things going on then he
[8:25] says oh Wretched Man that I am who
[8:29] shall deliver me from this body of
[8:34] death oh what a miserable person I am
[8:37] who will free me from this life that is
[8:40] dominated by sin and
[8:42] death who will deliver me from this
[8:45] flesh body that I live
[8:47] in but then he says I thank
[8:50] God the answer is in Jesus Christ Our
[8:53] Lord so you see how it is in my mind I
[8:57] really want to obey God's law but
[9:01] because of my sinful nature I am a slave
[9:04] to sin he was chained to a dead man
[9:09] we've heard that saying chained to a
[9:10] dead man I like the way Paul got the
[9:12] inspiration because he was actually
[9:13] chained to a soldier when he was in
[9:15] prison so he was chained to a dead man
[9:17] so we're walking around dragging a dead
[9:19] man around with us that's what this
[9:21] flesh man is is dead he should be dead
[9:25] get what I'm saying I thank God that
[9:28] he's Chang he's changed to a dead man a
[9:30] man that is born of the spirit of God
[9:33] does not commit sin brother Bram says
[9:36] this do you know your body is sin that's
[9:39] the
[9:40] reason now don't try to perfect this
[9:43] body it's sin did you know that it was
[9:46] born in sin shaped in iniquity it come
[9:49] to the world speaking lies and that soul
[9:53] is the same way until the soul died so
[9:58] you're saying my Soul was about to sin
[10:01] was full of sin just like my flesh
[10:03] was oh my
[10:06] goodness we were sin inside and
[10:10] out before we got
[10:13] saved our soul was as dark as our flesh
[10:16] was but then was our soul was then Born
[10:19] Again of God then that Soul can't
[10:23] die the soul that sinth shall die but he
[10:26] that believeth on me has ever
[10:29] everlasting life and then there is an
[10:31] immortal life living in that body that's
[10:34] a stream coming from heaven like a core
[10:38] on the inside of a man that's the part
[10:41] that's Godly and so it operates this
[10:44] body there's where bringing your body
[10:47] under
[10:48] subjection this soul is controlling what
[10:51] you see what you feel what you taste
[10:54] what you listen to what you say what you
[10:57] do so what you you're doing is what your
[11:01] soul is on what you have on inside your
[11:03] soul is what you will do but before this
[11:06] body can ever become
[11:08] perfected the spirit will bring it into
[11:11] submission to God to make you it'll War
[11:15] all the time it's constant Paul said we
[11:18] will never get more than he Paul said
[11:21] what when I would do good then evil is
[11:24] near me and there is a constant War this
[11:28] flesh against the spirit
[11:29] you know Paul no doubt wondering how can
[11:32] I even be
[11:33] saved how many W that sometimes how can
[11:37] I even be saved when I do these things
[11:41] when I iol say something I shouldn't
[11:42] have said or thought something I
[11:44] shouldn't have thought or done something
[11:45] I shouldn't have
[11:47] done what a battle that we have this
[11:49] body causes US problems we think the
[11:52] same way Paul does you know sometimes we
[11:54] get up say how can I even be saved how
[11:56] can God even Save Somebody Like Me
[12:00] is there anybody here that can Deliver
[12:02] Us from this flesh body that we live
[12:05] in how can I be a Christian with these
[12:08] thoughts in my head how can I be a
[12:10] Christian with these things I say come
[12:11] out of my
[12:13] mouth I'm going to be a little human for
[12:16] a minute and this is me y'all forgive
[12:20] me I'll go into a store and hear a song
[12:25] that I used to listen to years ago and
[12:27] next thing I do I find myself singing
[12:30] the lyrics
[12:34] yeah amen how many humans we have here
[12:39] am still have a few
[12:43] Angels you'll find yourself tapping your
[12:45] feet you know Ain't It
[12:47] Funny they say I just thought this ain't
[12:50] it funny you remember those songs that
[12:52] we heard back in the 80s or
[12:55] 90s but when somebody says you want to
[12:57] sing a Christian song we trying to like
[12:58] man the words put them words up there
[13:00] let me hear those
[13:02] words we battle with this
[13:06] flesh oh Wretched Man that I am who will
[13:09] deliver me from this
[13:11] body so there is therefore now no
[13:15] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[13:19] Jesus thank the I'm glad he said Christ
[13:22] Jesus because when if he said Jesus
[13:25] Christ it would be the man God but he
[13:27] say Christ Jesus it was God man
[13:30] there is therefore now no condemnation
[13:33] sorry I'm starting to preach which was
[13:35] in Christ Jesus or who belongs to Christ
[13:39] amen Who belongs to Christ who walks not
[13:42] after the flesh but after the spirit
[13:44] condemnation means the final
[13:48] verdict no
[13:50] punishment when the judge says not
[13:53] guilty there's no evidence against
[13:56] you Romans 4:25 says who was delivered
[14:00] for our offenses and was raised again
[14:02] for our
[14:04] justification this word justification
[14:06] used right here is only mentioned twice
[14:07] in the Bible the next one is Romans 5:18
[14:10] therefore as by offense of one judgment
[14:13] Came Upon all men to condemnation even
[14:17] so by the righteousness of our
[14:20] one the free gift that came upon man
[14:23] unto justification of life so here you
[14:26] go I will give your Christmas gift to
[14:28] you
[14:30] early and we'll give you a present the
[14:33] meaning of the word justification this
[14:35] one means a
[14:38] quiddle a judgment that a person is not
[14:41] guilty of the crime in which the person
[14:45] has been
[14:46] charged Hallelujah you know you I stood
[14:49] in a courtroom one
[14:51] day the judges looked at me he says from
[14:55] the evidence that I have stacked against
[14:57] you you're guilty
[15:00] what are you going to
[15:01] plead I said your honor there's nobody
[15:04] here to defend
[15:06] me no lawyer will take my case they seen
[15:09] the evidence they know there's no way
[15:11] they could win I was fixing to H say
[15:15] guilty but then something spoke behind
[15:17] me says I'll take his
[15:20] case Hallelujah I turned around as when
[15:23] Mercy Mercy Walked In he said I'll be
[15:26] his lawyer I'll take his case hallelujah
[15:30] oh what a defense we have that's right
[15:32] what a Defender we have my lawyer has a
[15:37] reputation of never losing a case
[15:41] Hallelujah he has 100% acquittal
[15:45] rate if we have mercy Christ as your
[15:48] lawyer we can't lose that's right amen
[15:52] so judges looks at
[15:54] me not guilty Hallelujah
[15:59] all charges has been dropped it's as
[16:02] though I didn't do it in the first place
[16:05] praise the freedom from judgment that's
[16:08] the title I'm not going to get done but
[16:10] that's the title so there is therefore
[16:13] no condemnation to them that are in
[16:15] Christ Jesus listen what the prophet
[16:18] said about it there is therefore now no
[16:20] condemnation to them that are not it's
[16:22] not those who just believes in him it's
[16:25] those who are in him in Christ Jesus
[16:28] that walk walks not after the flesh but
[16:30] after the spirit and my word and spirit
[16:34] and life because Jesus said in it is a
[16:37] spirit that quith the flesh that proth
[16:38] nothing the words I speak unto you they
[16:41] are spirit and they are life so he says
[16:43] there's no more condemnation you're free
[16:45] from sin free from the cares of the
[16:48] world no
[16:50] condemnation why to them that have been
[16:52] by one Spirit baptized into one body
[16:55] that's what it says in 1 Corinthians 12
[16:58] this is how your free from judgment
[17:00] Believers in Christ are
[17:02] free from judgment because their sins
[17:05] were already judged at Calvary for by
[17:08] one Spirit we are baptized into one
[17:11] body there the blood of the Lamb has
[17:13] been applied the god of Heaven has
[17:16] accepted you his life is in you you are
[17:20] Sons and Daughters of God it's what
[17:23] Romans 8:16 says the spirit itself bear
[17:25] witness with our spirit that we are amen
[17:28] the children of God God your character
[17:30] is God's
[17:32] character not a little pushover he says
[17:35] no sir God is the god of judgment he is
[17:38] the god of correct it must be on the
[17:41] line nothing else will do that's right
[17:45] that's the kind of character that you
[17:46] are amen because you're the character of
[17:49] your father so there is no judgment to
[17:53] the Royal spiritual Seed of
[17:56] Abraham judgment is not our future
[17:58] future event it's not a future event for
[18:01] the believer that's right it was settled
[18:03] at the cross a Believer is Justified and
[18:06] free from the fear of standing judgment
[18:10] praise God because brother say A True
[18:12] Believer bypasses judgment because
[18:15] Christ already stood in their place
[18:19] thank God because Galatians 329 says and
[18:23] if you be Christ then you are Abraham's
[18:25] seed and HS according to the promise
[18:29] that's why we're free from judgment
[18:31] we're predestinated to eternal life we
[18:35] don't have to read it but Ephesians 14
[18:37] says it he's chosen you in him before
[18:39] the foundation of the world Acts 3 1348
[18:42] says and when the Gentiles heard this
[18:43] they were glad and glorified the word of
[18:45] the Lord as many that were ordained to
[18:47] eternal life
[18:49] believed and they accepted God's
[18:51] provided sacrifice amen and that
[18:54] sacrifice which was Christ the word cuz
[18:57] John 3918 says he that believeth on him
[19:00] is not condemned but he that believeth
[19:04] not is condemned already because he hath
[19:07] not believed in the name of the only
[19:09] begotten Son of
[19:10] God the the John 5:24 says verily verily
[19:14] I say unto you he that believeth he that
[19:17] heareth my word and believeth on him
[19:19] that sent me hath everlasting life and
[19:22] shall not come into condemnation but is
[19:25] passed from Death unto life Hallelujah
[19:29] that he that heareth my word is he that
[19:33] understandeth Believers are exempt from
[19:36] standing in judgment because they've
[19:38] already passed from Death To Life Christ
[19:41] bore the punishment for their sins
[19:45] because brother BR says when that you
[19:46] accept Christ you are judged right there
[19:49] amen your sins are cast into the sea of
[19:52] forgetfulness never to be remembered
[19:55] again and you won't face them at the
[19:57] Judgment thank the Lord Lord he says any
[20:00] drunkard anything else can hear it and
[20:02] walk away but he that heareth my word
[20:05] and understandeth my word believeth on
[20:08] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[20:11] and shall not come into judgment but
[20:14] your pass from Death unto
[20:16] life how can a man say that the bride of
[20:19] Christ goes into a
[20:20] tribulation he says I can't understand
[20:22] it she's taken away from tribulation if
[20:25] the church has been judged they have
[20:28] judged judge
[20:30] themselves Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 1
[20:32] Corinthians 13 for if we judge ourselves
[20:36] we should not be judged amen but when we
[20:39] are judged we are chastened of the Lord
[20:42] that we not be condemned with the world
[20:45] chasing means to train to be instructed
[20:48] or taught to cause one to learn so when
[20:52] we come to church these preachers get
[20:54] behind this pull pit we are taught
[20:57] they're teaching us
[20:59] they're correcting us they're moing our
[21:01] characters moing our character to be
[21:03] like the character of God cuz some men
[21:06] sin goes is open beforehand going before
[21:09] to judgment and some men follow after so
[21:13] they have accepted the blood how can God
[21:15] judge a man that's perfectly totally
[21:20] sinless there's no such person every
[21:23] Born Again believer True Believer is
[21:27] perfectly abs absolutely sinless before
[21:31] God that's what 1 John 5:18 says for we
[21:34] know that whosoever is born of God sinth
[21:36] not and he that is begotten of God keep
[21:38] keepeth himself and that Wicked one
[21:41] cannot touch
[21:42] him so whosoever is born of God do not
[21:45] commit sin for his seed remaineth in him
[21:48] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[21:51] God so we're not trusting to our works
[21:54] it's to trus in the blood of Jesus
[21:56] Christ the blood of Christ that confess
[21:58] is dipped into it's what the Bible
[22:01] says for whosoever shall save his life
[22:03] shall lose it and whosoever shall lose
[22:05] his life for my sake shall find
[22:10] it I'll stop right
[22:15] there y'all pray for the service God
[22:18] bless you
