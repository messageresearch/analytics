some changing back here in the office and for my Word document to my books and it's not showing up so you all pray and I've deleted it and I've closed it restarted everything but God's got it all in control just want to say Welcome to our visitors cousin Caroline and her husband Julian visit sorry you have to hear me we like brother Mark I believe mentioned we want to remember our pastor up in Columbia and brother Jason and brother Matt down in Honduras think today is their first day of their sermon Services they're going to have so we want to keep them in prayer how many has a need they bring for the Lord let's go to him in prayer father we just thank you for this opportunity Lord that we have to come into your service Lord an honor to stand before your people Lord I just pray God as I step up to this desk Lord a great responsibility just a a human being father but Lord it falls my lot to stand here God you see what I have before me Lord May that same presence that come down in my office this morning Lord May that presence just be here today Father Lord cuz we need you more than anything father to to speak to to our knees Lord yes Father I just pray God may you anoint my lips anoint their ears father be with our pastor the brothers that's away Lord the people that's sick and not able to attend service Lord may you be with them and the hands that was raised in needs of the people God only you know their need father Lord you can bring a man to come across his pull pit to say something exactly to what they need Lord father we place this service in your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to Joshua chapter 1 I want to read verse verse one down to 11 I might just skip a few I don't apologize to the booth you know how I am I don't send power power points but I have a lot of scripture a lot of quotes I told sister Esther I may or may not do so bear with me you can't never read too many quotes I know there's some people around the message that don't want the preachers come in and read quotes but when I go to those churches I read quotes I just don't say brother brandom said and it's okay so if you don't hear me say brother BR said you know I'm reading a quote you know you know the message Joshua 1 chapter 1 now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son brother I mean my Ser Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give them even to the children of Israel and every place that the soul of your foot shall th tread upon that have I given you as I said unto Moses verse 5 they there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so will I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and a good and of good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide inheritance in the land only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or left that thou mayest Prosper wheresoever thou goest and then the book of law shall not depart out of thy mouth Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou May observe to do according to this written for Thou shalt make thy way prosperous then shalt have good success so God's telling Joshua three times be strong and a good courage cuz Joshua you've got something to do it's your turn he says if you do it going to prosper but Joshua command Joshua commanded the offer saying pass through the host command the people saying prepare you victuals for within three days we're going to go over this Jordan and you're going to take the land may God out of blessings you can have your seats for a title this morning I want to speak on it's your turn to play your part it's your turn to play your part so God was telling Joshua hey Moses my servant's dead it's time for you to step up it's time for you to do your part get thee up and go over the Jordan he says be strong I'm going to be with you it's your part you have something to do Joshua the children of Israel laid across stayed across Jordan and waiting around after Moses died because because the Bible says it come to pass God spoke to Joshua man you can go many places right there and it came to pass but God spoke to Joshua says okay Joshua it's time for you all to quit wondering what's going to happen Joshua Moses is is dead it's your time it's your turn to step up to the plate it's your turn to take these children over Jordan it's time to step up it's time for you to shine Joshua you're on the on Deck Circle we all know what an on Deck Circle those that's played baseball you got the batter at the home plate he's up there and he's swinging and he's getting ready to hit you got a guy behind him there's a circle and he's back there warming up he's on the on Deck Circle he knows he's getting ready to get into the ball game so he's sitting there watching that pitcher if you watch a baseball game you know he's trying to time it just right trying to time it with the pitcher trying to get the right hit then that batter get on home plate gets on base then what happens that guy in the own deck Circle comes up it's his turn it's his turn to get into the game now I don't have brother diggs's sign up here well I sure could use some amens it's awful quiet in here we got a lot of amen people missing today so brother Danny I want to hear it y'all ready we have a Ministry just like Joshua had a Ministry we have a Ministry the bride has a Ministry yeah the Bible says go ye therefore in all the world and preach the gospel they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover brother said he question as would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture sure that's what's going on right now the bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour the bride of Christ she consists of Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the bride of Christ she's got a Ministry and he calls it a great ministry it's the ministry of the hour it's a body Ministry it's not this great man who rose up or that great we've seen a lot of that we've seen a lot of so-called Great Men R up and so many great doctrines rise up in his message has been nothing but a failure they falter down it's not about any man it's not about me it's not about brother Matthew it's not about brother brandom it's about the man Jesus Christ the message is not about brother brandom he was just the the deliverer of the message it's not about him it's not about you it's not about me but it's about Jesus Christ the message is not a person the message is not a person but it's the person you are not the message I sit rot I said what you're not a message brother Brandon wasn't a message you know we say it all the time I'm in the message don't we what do you do when people out here ask you what religion you're in you say I'm in the message no you'll see well I'm Pentecostal Holiness yeah that's what we are we're Pentecostal Holiness okay whatever they're happy with it how many you went around said I'm in the message people look at you like you're crazy where I'm going a lot of people says it we don't use the word message to them people but we have a Ministry you ask the Bri you ask the bride has a Ministry hold on a minute thing's messed up again praise the lord we don't use the word message to the people we ask a lot of people though when you are you in the message because if they D if they're got their dresses on the women say I bet they're message people are you in the message you awful quiet it's all right no it ain't really sa man every now and then you say I'm Oneness I'm Tunis I'm message you saying I'm message is no different you saying I'm a Baptist I'm a presbeterian I'm a Catholic it's no different but is the message in you is the message in you cuz that's what the message is the message is Jesus Christ the message has to be in you we grew up in this message we grew up in this mess age a lot of people's made a mess of of this message bringing up their twoo doctrines or three gods or return Ministry pastors going starting churches all over the world says you got to pay your tith to me message messes that's all they do is make a bunch of messes it should be able to say that we are the message when somebody says what religion are you I'm the message not I'm in it but I'm the message cuz what is the message is Christ in you the hope of glory so when we when we go around and say what's your religion we should be able to say my religion is I am the message because Jesus says I and my father are one if you can truly say that this morning if you have God inside your heart you can truly say I and my father are one I am the message woo can you stand this morning make that same statement that Jesus did I and my father are one if you can't make that statement uhoh here I go again don't leave this bill until you can the importance of getting God in your heart that's the way you could say I'm the message is get God in your heart if you got to want it bad enough we were up at brother Donnie's last weekend my sister and her her husband they take care of the church locking up and she had told told us that a man had come up to the altar just a couple weeks ago W the Holy Ghost after they prayed for him he sit down at the altar and sit there laid there my sister got it got late got real late up I guess up toward midnight the man says cut the lights off lock the door I'm not leaving here till I get the Holy Ghost he wanted it it's like brother brand said that man said I want the Holy Ghost and I'm not leaving if they come they'll find a bag of bones right here here that's how bad we want it but we've got to know that we know that we know that we have it but you can't Play Your Part You Can't Play Your Part in this message until you have it until that message is in US you'll say what part what part do I do I'm not a preacher but you're a housewife you're a mother you're a father you're a doctor you're a heat and air guy you're a handyman you're a computer geek you have something to do you're a deacon you're an acting Deacon everybody has their part to play hallelujah what a great feeling I won't say it again I just feel PR what a great feeling if you could stand here and say I and my father are one look Beyond this flesh look beyond what you're looking at and say I and my father are one but this message is Jesus Christ the ministry of Jesus Christ is in the body of the Bride the ministry of Christ himself impersonated among his people that definition impersonated means to assume or act the character of you're doing the very same things he did because know brother Bram said if I was John Dillinger the things that the acts that John Diller did I would do if I was bethoven I would play just like Beethoven if I was Jesus Christ I would do exactly what he did doing the very same things he did when he was here on Earth in his body the bride which is part of him doing the same things when Jesus was crucii brother said he took the spirit off of him and put his body in the grave his soul in Hell raised him up on the third day raised up his body and brought it up into Glory there sent the spirit back down and kept that body on the right hand get it sent the spirit back down to live in the church to make a church just as much with the Life of Christ that that was in the Resurrection The Two come together bride and bridegroom the church and Christ will be exactly alike with the same kind of ministry same kind of power wo Hallelujah same kind of spirit he raised up the body of Jesus Christ and set him on his right side his right hand and then poured his Spirit down on the church on the day of Pentecost the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the same the ministry of Jesus Christ chist on Earth has to be the same as the ministry he had or he can't come to it so if if our so-called message churches don't line up with the the message he ain't coming we know he ain't coming for these people out here it's just like the head to the feet the feet is not the head it looked kind of funny wouldn't it you trying to walk on your head get your body out of order how many here can walk on their head not their hands just their head no you're not made for that these things were made for that your head just controls your feet so how many gets up in the morning you're getting out of bed you go feet get over and you move your feet over all out leg stand up all right right foot Left Foot Right Foot left foot how many does that I hope nobody has to do that it's automatic your alarm clock goes off your M says I got to get up I got to go to the bathroom Wash Me brush my teeth you don't tell your feet to go it's automatic you'll see where I'm going the head picks the feet makes the feet tells it where to go it has to be because a woman at husband become one they become one and so does the bride of Christ become one the ministry of the Bride the ministry of Christ is the same have you got it Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever father son Holy Ghost he's the same God hallelujah no different it's not three different people Jesus the same as he was in the beginning Jesus was the same when he's on Earth Jesus is the same today walking among you living among you the same Ministry so what happened when Peter and John walked by the gate called Beautiful they seen this man laying there want money Peter poured like the rest of those preachers Silver and Gold Have I None but what I have I give to thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk how did how did Peter do that because Jesus says in John 14:11 believe me that I'm in the father and the father in me or else believe me just for the work's sake if you don't believe me just believe the works I perform for verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to to my father so how would we do the Greater Works cuz Jesus says down in verse 20 at that day ye shall know that I'm in the father and ye are in me and I am in you that's how you could know you can walk up and say you say to this mountain be thou moved ask anything in my name and I will do it that's what Peter said when he walked up there in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk whatsoever you ask in my name he says in my name you shall cast out devils not I will Jesus said in my name I will cast out the Devils he says no you will he says you will cast out Devils I'm talking about playing our part you will cast out Devils you'll do the Greater Works you can say to this mountain if you say to this mountain so God is saying you go ahead and speak it it's me saying it Hallelujah now I believe did something that Jesus didn't do you know they laid the sick in the streets and just the shadow of Peter overshadowed them and they were healed we should be able to do the same thing I could walk right by you this morning if you're sick just my shadow should be able to heal you not me the message inside of me Hallelujah the ministry of the Bride will do what he did what is brother says what is the true Church's Ministry the ministry at that church will be the ministry of the sun because it's reflecting the same sun power not Su n but s o n the same sunlight that the world will know when the Sun rises what it will look like that's why John says he's got to increase so I'm going to decrease both of them could stay on the earth at the same time hold on when brother Bram was here a lot of people kept brother Bram up here with Christ both of them couldn't be here at the same time brother Bram says I've got to decrease but a lot of us has left brother brandham up here and has brought God down we left brother brandom as our God he's got a decrease so that Christ in us can increase that we can do the Greater Works the voice that spoke people don't get it brother bram's God so when the voice spoke at the river when he was baptized in that M went blank baptizing that person in the voice of God spoke and says as John the Baptist will sent the forun my first coming you will be sent the forun my second coming if those people had any Revelation they'll say hold on what happened to John as soon as John baptized Jesus and the spirit of God ascended on Jesus like a dove he went to the Wilderness you didn't hear no more of John except are you the one or should we look for another that's when he said I've got a decrease he recognized it brother brandom recognized he's got to decrease because Joshua's got to take over we have a part to play in this brother brandom's done his part and he done it well we need to do ours it's our turn we need to do our part well we're we're not waiting on another man to come and pick this thing up where brother bam left off they said but but he's got to come back he wants to preach the trail of the serpent he even had notes ready to do it he was headed back to Jeffersonville to preach the trail of the serpent anybody that knows the message knows he's already preached the trail of the serpent he started with a with a serpent up in heaven went all way down through the Bible through Jesus Christ when Jesus Christ stomped on his head into the end of the book of Revelation where he's destroyed there's his Trail so we don't need brother R to come back and preach that to us wow he says these young men will take this message on will take this bride onto a Rapture that light that was with brother brandham is that light that's with us today you know they took the picture that Pillar of Fire it's it's in this building this morning two men could be on the earth at the same time what happened to Elijah and Elisha Elijah know he was fixing to die he says my time to go so he went around saying goodbyes to all the people in the countryside is telling Elisha you stay here you stay here and you take care of these people they know you're next in line you're second in command you take over Elisha says no where you go I'll go where you dwell I'll dwell your people will be my people your God will be my God has the he said as the Lord God liveth I'll not leave thee so he gets across the river Jordan and sees Elijah put his mantle down the we know the story The Water opened up they walked across Elijah says what do you want from me Elisha says I want a double portion of your spirit could we say that Lord give me a double portion of your spirit because you promise the Greater Works we'll do Hallelujah here come a fire Chariot Out of Heaven sweep down and picked Elijah up Elisha says I see you then drops down that mantle Elisha goes takes off his old code of his religion lets it fall to the ground and picks up that mantle and walks up to the River Jordan he didn't walk up to the River Jordan brother Matthew and says no I asked for double portion can I really speak and see somebody healed can I really speak and see my son and daughter saved he didn't do that it was automatic to Elisha he walks right up there and takes that mantle off and says where is the god of Elisha and smoked the river that opened up and there he went walking out on dry land and you got the mantle we've got the mantle we can do Greater Works it's our turn to do our part the torch has been passed to us you know this is the time of the Olympics coming up later on this month and what they do a couple of months before they light this torch and so they'll go to Olympia in Greece that's the original place where the the Olympics started they I I what I've read they keep that fire burning all the time so what they do they take this torch and they light it and then they carry it around and go to the host country like this time it's France and they'll take it to every town they'll go up through mountains up through valleys until they'll get to where the games are actually going to take place we got a great torch that was lit before the foundation of the world and it's passed on down through time it's come out through Adam it went through Abel went through Seth it went through Noah it went through Moses it went through David through Solomon through Jesus Through Paul through Peter through all the church ages Martin Luther Wesley up through brother brandham when the torch got the brother branon when he went off the scene he handed to somebody we're carrying the torch that light has been passed to us it's our time it's our turn the Bible says AR Rise and Shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall rise upon thee and the glory shall be seen upon thee what happens when that light has come I like this scripture this is for us moms and dads lift up thine eyes round about and see all they gather themselves they come to thee thy sons and thy daughters shall be back by thy side Hallelujah R says oh you morning Stars you rise and shine it's your time to shine the coming of the Lord is at hand reflecting the presence reflecting the oncoming son give given the same signs Jesus said it was as it was in the days of Sodom for real it'll be the same thing in the coming of the son of man the same Ministry that the sun went down is the same light that went down is coming again in resurrection power and The Morning Star is reflecting that light then God's light will be reflected in his church more powerful than ever just before the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ that coming is right at hand this is going to be a powerful light brother says we're living in the last days it's a big Pillar of Fire what Pillar of Fire the one that led the children of Israel from the Wilderness everything's got a nature it'll bear its nature in that person now when this Pillar of Fire was made flesh and dwelt Among Us God was made flesh in his son Christ Jesus we are all aware that he was God are do we there's no two God people in here is there notice when he was here on Earth look at the ministry he had when he went around and you mean to tell he so you mean to tell me you're with Abraham you're only 50 years old well before Abraham was I am The Works he did a little while the world won't see me no more but you shall see me for I'll be with you even in you skipping a little bit don't get scared the world the church the so-called Church the outside world they won't see it how about this light there's nothing to it don't believe that kind of stuff they'll say there's no such thing as a baptism of the Holy Ghost there's no such thing as speaking in tongues no such things as gifts of Prophecy all these are Divine healings that's nonsense but God promised in the last days that he'll pour out both former and latter rain at the same time upon his church the days of the prophets the days of the Apostles he'd pour out both former and latter Reigns in the last days and we've got it the Lord is here showing just exactly what Jesus says would take place before his coming in the last days these things take place we are aware of that we're living in that hour of the approaching of the Lord we'll see his signs everywhere this voice of God is in you cuz brother Bram said the final voice will be in the bride so whatever you you say will take place what happened when brother bran was was was in that room with Haddie Wright and brother bran was speaking he was telling the story about the Three Squirrels he was telling the story about the three how he just spoke them and here they come people thought he was crazy but that little sister hadie R spoke up and said that's nothing but the truth and when she said that we know she said the right thing brother Bram spoke to her and God cuz God said tell her to speak whatever she wants brother Bram had done his part he told the story her faith was so great that ain't nothing but the truth it was her turn it was her turn to use the spoken word what did she do she could ask for anything she could ask for her mom and dad to be young again she could ask for her sister to be here she could have asked for a million dollars but she asked for the most important thing so she spoke that my sons will have eternal life that spirit of God dropped down into that room I like to been there them two boys over the corner making fun of everything all all of a sudden the spirit of God drop down on them they giving their heart to Jesus Christ you may say yeah but they're not living for the Lord right now it don't matter because God gave them eternal life right there had he right used her part she was her turn say will it work for him it ought to worked for me if it work for brother brandom and hady right it'll work for you whatever you have need of speak to this mountain and it will move the bride's Ministry is not going to be some dead religion it's going to be something that has life to it but we got to play our part It's like a symphony everybody has a part to play the last time I heard a symphony preached on talk about a part to play I was up in North Carolina a few years ago and brother Ron Spencer was preaching and he was preaching on the symphony and we were sitting right here in the front row very front row right in front of him and he had preached a good 20 minutes or more not even look he didn't even look at me he was just preaching away on the symphony when it's time to play you part when it's time to do you you'll get what I'm meaning here in a minute all of a sudden he was on this side I was sitting probably where this sister in the pink dress is and I walked and he walked he said I'm going to stop right here just for a minute but at that time I was sitting here praying about preaching didn't want to I was wondering is this really right I'm so old I'm too old for this people always remind me Moses didn't start till he was 80 but Ron Spencer walked on the platform I'm I'm going to stop my thought right now and he point his finger right at my face he said when it's your turn You'll Play Your Part he turns around and kept preaching back where he left off and never did look at me the rest of the service I kind of looked over it Sarah said did he do just did he just do what I thought he did he did so when it's my turn I'm going to play my part so I'm going to point my finger at each one of you all this morning when it's your turn You'll Play Your Part some of you boys might be preachers some of you might be taking Tony's spot some might be taking brother Luther's spot somebody might be a pastor this church one day when it's your turn You'll Play Your Part it ain't only for the men it's for you sisters too everybody has a part to play you might you might feel in your heart this morning I want to be a Sunday school teacher oh by the way we need one that was brother Jason didn't tell me to say that but we must play our part It's like a symphony everybody has a part to play in this drama a symphony tells a story in music all different types of instruments are there in this Orchestra it's kind of funny this morning I sent a text to musicians about something and then I asked brother John if he has a violin and of course I got corrected it's not a violin it's a viola a viola sorry see I still don't know what it is so evident it's different than the violin well I got looking later I said my phone's going crazy what's going on and then brother Brad camell puts what a what it is and did a whole text I didn't have time to read it all but I got in in parts and I kept seeing different violins in an orchestra like oh I better I close that cuz they're getting over on what I'm going to do this morning but there's different kinds of instruments in this thing there's a violin you wonder why these brothers come in here sisters Micah goes at this chair Steve will go to this one brother Aaron almost forgot your name brother Chris sister Ruth brother Andrew why do they go to them instruments that's what they're that's what they're called to play some of them can play all of them but I don't think you could take Micah say hey Micah where's Micah go over and play me Amazing Grace what if they come in here they all on different instruments they're out of order they're not in their part that they sound so good don't they I think we have the best musicians second I better go ahead and say it is Brother Don church but they all have a part to play right you should have preached I tried to get you to in this syy of God we have Apostles prophets preachers teachers pastors husbands wives get my point we have all these people in this great big Symphony Of God there's one you know in the symphony people will come in they ain't got a clue what's going on back here they don't have a clue have you ever been to a symphony how many been to a symphony I've never been to one but don't they right before they start playing everybody's playing something totally different it sounds like a mess don't it you're like what in the world is going on I've paid 80 bucks to come in here and watch the list these people play and they sound awful and all of a sudden the the conductor walks up there grabs a little stick Taps it silence and then he starts doing this and here comes the little violins they come playing in beautiful sound and then the V The Villa whever you say it comes in next and here comes the percussions and and and well it's like our church you come in here all these guys right here are waiting on this piano player to start playing and they're over hurry up brother Andrew he's over getting everything perfect fixing the screen getting the sound right that's back there and Pops his finger looks back at us and nods it's his time and he starts playing beautiful brother Micah doesn't start first the drums doesn't start first but when brother Andrew starts playing then here comes all these instruments in and makes a beautiful sound you see what point I'm getting at we all have a part to play we've got to play our own part if you're a housewife God didn't call you to be a preacher even though I've heard some women that can preach my wife was playing me somebody not too long ago and this woman was abolutely tearing it up I said Lord I wish I could preach like that so if your housewife you can't be a preacher if you're a trustee you can't be a deacon if you're a deacon you can't be a trustee if you're a preacher you can't be a deacon I would rather be a deacon but you got every one of us has our part to play we can't do our own thing it's like a well old machine you know we are the body of Christ you know it's kind of funny not really funny but last Friday we was up at Ron's and I was before service I was praying cuz I had a I had a a feeling that I'd be here this morning I was supposed to been in Columbia with brother Jason but I had a feeling I was going to be here this morning I said' Lord what do you want me to preach on and it come across playing your part the bride's got a Ministry it's your turn and so all all the things that goes with it had a lot of stuff wrote down brother M gets up there and preaches and he comes out his title is passing the Baton where he talks it left Elijah and went to Elisha that this message has left brother brandham has come to the bride I'm like what in the world so I just kind of pushed off the side and I kind of text I thought it would get the next morning I was up looking at a few things I text Brother mat that but come in here Wednesday night and the weapon was preaching and I'm sitting here looking at him like dude you got to be quiet cuz he started hitting on the body of Christ we're one body we're one God one people so we're all a body of Christ we're part of this body and he just kep like quit we we're a member many body of Jesus Christ we all have a different part we'll skip here I wna go down to uh 1 Corinthians 12:12 for as the body is one and hath many members all the members of that one body being many are one body also in Christ for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles it don't matter who you are whether we be Bond or free all have been made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say I don't want to be a foot I want to be the hand you look kind of funny your feet up here and your hands down here what if the foot shall say because I'm not the hand I'm not the body bless God if I can't preach I ain't going to be nothing and if the ear shall say because I'm not the eye I'm not of the body is it therefore not of the body is it the eye part of the body the ear part of the body if the whole body were an i boy that would look funny wouldn't it walk around just one big eyeball walking around everywhere eyeballs getting hungry well how you going to eat if the whole body were an eye were were the hearing if the hole were a hearing where's a smelling but now hath God set the remembers every one of them in the body as it pleased him I don't want to be a preacher but it pleased God to place me here you my I don't want to come up here and sing songs but God placed you here why because it pleased him I want to please him sometimes it's hard and if they were all one member then what were the body but now are they many members yet one body and the ey cannot say into the hand I have no need of thee nor the head to the feet I have no need of thee they the head needs the feet the feet needs the head the hands need the mouth or the mouth needs the hand whatever you know what I'm saying and the I cannot say into the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of thee nay much more than those members of the body which seem to be more feeble as necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and aely parts or more abundant comess verse 26 and whether one member suffer we all suffer and one member be honored all of us rejoice with it now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular so no matter what we say or do we can't help it we're a member it's your turn it's time to play your part oh no I forgot to set my timer we are like a well oiled machine I'm part of a body so we just work automatically it's like a machine when you go turn your key in your car your motor is just doing everything you don't know what it's doing but it's all working together it's all work you just get in putting Drive you're down the road it's all everything working together that's what a body does my body right now is working together my head is not even have to tell my feet what to do it's doing it anyway it's automatic it's like when the preacher is up here preaching it's automatic amen some we don't have to sit up here and say get us pumped up Prime hey let's worship god let's bring an atmosphere in the church it should be automatic Lord we need you this morning come down should be automatic that's what we should be automatic just doing our part it's your turn I'm a part of little of of of Jesus Christ I might be the little toe but I'm a part of him I have a purpose if I'm just there for balance that's all I want to be I don't want to be I don't want to be the big toe I don't want to be the head Lord just let me be the little toe in your body and do what you want me to be we're back in this great drama in a symphony only a composer the director and these people behind here knows what's going on they know what's in the Sheep music the people in the atist has no clue but when they start when they start the music a symphony tells a story and if you know the story you know what they're doing like brown would say like that Russian thing they Peter and the Wolf that they know exactly what's going on by the beating of the drums by the rise and fall of Music These instruments here on this platform they all sound good but you just can't play the bass by itself brother Aaron's good probably the best sorry y'all but a base can't play by itself it's got to have something else a preacher can't get up here and preach by itself he's got to have somebody else this building's empty I could be up here preaching by themselves this thing does not sound good that that drum that bass that manin needs that piano right I know you say oh but that piano get could play by itself that's not my point we'll use that later but add the piano in add the organ into you got a great sound coming forth they get back here in this room before service they practice and the song Lead said this is my song and they're practicing they're getting it down they've got practice so when it come out here it's automatic brother Ken turn around and say I'm going to sing this song b already know what key that's in unless you're too old you can't remember he yet to be told but they automatically know what key it's in this scripture is God's Symphony only the composer knows what it really means and reveals it to those who are listening are you listening who are interested in knowing wow you got to be interested in knowing this know knowing what the drama is but you have to know about a symphony first it's not just something you see it's the changing it's the junction the Junctions of the word of the music sometimes it's going that way for a while this way for a while a certain beat and after a while it changes around to you who would understand it and don't know nothing about it and you're not even interested in it it's just a bunch of Racket it's a fuss but to those who knows about it they're watching for it they know what's coming if you're in this drama are you watching for the next part the beating of the music you hear it getting louder and louder something's fixing to happen you got a man standing back here with these two big symbols he only has one part to play and the music is building up and building up and and all a sudden the director points at him and he clashes it and Martin Luther comes out says the just shall live by faith and he backs off and he composure calms everybody down it starts directing again the music starts playing all of a sudden it starts rising up again it might took a hundred years or more it starts rising up all of a sudden it starts getting faster and faster director points at the symbols again and he clashes and here comes Wesley the great big drama of God unfolding in his church all the way down through the church ages everybody had their part to play when it come down the music fading again calming down here comes the buildup and we're ready cuz we know something's fixing to happen because we recognize the music we know what's fixing to happen Luther didn't know what was fixing to happened when the music started getting louder Wesley didn't know what happened Pentecost didn't know what happened but we know what's getting ready to happen the music is building it's building it's getting faster rising up you know how it is sometimes these guys get so anointed you feel the spirit just rising up in here you feel the anointing getting ready to drop down something's fixing to happen it ain't about these brothers it's about what's anointing is on them because anointing fixed to come out here and preach the gospel I'm feeling good we're waiting for that one person that might be your job you've heard of all these people are one hit wonders they do one song and you don't hear nothing from them you call them one hit wonders that's what you might be just a one hit wonder that's what I want to be Lord if you could just use me for one thing I played my part but I want to be willing to play my part BR says so we had these times of Symphonies of God's word that the whole drama changes you who are interested are listening for that change you know it's getting close you hear the way the drums are beating something's getting ready to happen you know this is a change it's going to break out into burst into a few minutes I like the way he said that it's going to break out into a burst in a few minutes you're watching for it you can tell the way the drums are timing oh God if you could hear the drums of the Finish now if you could hear the echo of the music of the Heavenly word singing itself out it shall come to pass in the last days the Symphony of God's Great drama that he's played it changes him his Symphony at the junction the composer and those who are interested are listening for the change that's what all this stuff is to us we're listening we're watching every time he appears something happens we see the time getting close we see back Yonder not long ago when the church age were being drawn out we were listening we seen it was right with the word beating with the word after a while what happened here he come himself and vindicate it one time he said about the third pull how it would come by this way knowing by then by knowing the heart and then by the spoken word Jesus says greater things than this shall you do because I go to the father when we hear the symphony beating and changing fixing the change it's a junction of time we notice has he begin to beat we seen the works that I do I've said that a lot this morning the works that I do which you shall do also greater shall you do greater he promised we wondered how that could be but did you notice when he first performed his first miracle he took water and turned it to Wine he took water which potentially someday might have been wine but it was water first and when he had fed 5,000 what did he do he took something that had been been like water he took a fish that was once swam and was bornn from an egg he broke it and another fish growed into the creation that was the original creation he took bread that was once wheat which was a seed become bread he spoke from his bread and the creation only multiplied it but in the woods back Yonder it were was nothing there to make a squirrel with all I said was let there be and there it was the same Jesus Christ said the Greater Works shall you do because he said we've got enough power in us to go speak another world into existence and go live on it the world don't understand this drama they don't understand it because it's a bunch of nonsense he says because they're not Methodist the methods don't understand it because they're not Baptist the Baptist don't understand it because it's not C cic the Catholic don't understand it it's just because it's not what they believe in the Pentecostals don't believe it because they don't understand it those who wait on the Lord those who are looking are you looking and listening you got your spiritual ears open this morning and you hear the r the the rising of the drama it's building the composer knows the end from the beginning he knows all about it that's the reason he could write it there correctly now you must begin with him you must begin with him if you want to hear a symphony you begin with him like the music out of symphony you'll listen you know what it says it's going to be about what the symphony is then you begin to listen at the music I've heard a lot of Racket I've been in churches well the the musicians is awful they're not on key everybody is doing their own thing on the platform we was in church not too long ago it was that way the poor song leader he was having a fit brother Ken you would have died You' have turned around and walked off kind of hard to sing to somebody who's doing their own thing Bunch racket about finished you know what it is you know what it's about it's where certain certain things take place it's going to change it's the beat of the bass it's the sounding of the trumpets it's the beat on the drums it's the whole thing together in Rhythm it makes the drama till you could close your eyes and live it I'm sure brother Andrew if you're listening to something like that you will just close your eyes and anybody who does who likes good music will close your eyes and you just feel like you're there you feel like you can see the guy conducting it you can hear all kinds of different instruments coming in at different times playing in Rhythm man could close his mortal eyes to Earthly sight and live in the presence of Jesus Christ where he sees the word being beat out in the great Symphony that we are living in now you don't stand off and look at it the guy playing the viola or whatever it is he ain't standing back and say woo go that violin sounds good I can't play my part that's too good but I think it's a different sounds of what you sent this morning they all have different sounds so he's got to play his part we got six different Brothers in this church that preaches we're all different I can stand back brother Matthew you got a different part I can't do your part you can't do mine thank God you can't do mine you get into the rhythm of it how do you get in there you're born into it you're predestinated to be in this part you're ordained to play to get in this Rhythm come in turn the sound system on go to the iPad turn it on go back there hit the computer music automatic Jackson's done his part this morning his part now is to make me sound good if I get too loud he brings me down if I get too he brings me up he's playing his part brother King gets up here this morning let's all stand let's sing this song get us into worship brother Ken's doing his part we didn't tell him to do it brother Tony just called him says hey can you Le singing Sunday morning I sure can I've got a part to play he might be the backup to the backup to the backup but he's got a part to play you might be the third string piano player but it's when it's your turn get up there and play with all your might I might been in fourth in line to preach this morning but I've come here and I've given it all my might you had to become part of that word you had to become part of the dance to get in the dance you have to become part of the ball game something you're interested in you know what I'm talking about brother Gideon you got got to be interested in that ball game that you're supposed to be playing in before you can get put in get in sitting on the bench over there pick me coach I'm ready how mean how how can we can how many can do that this morning okay Coach God I'm ready to do my part pick me or just say I can't play that piano as good as brother Andrew does who cares if you're called on do it if you're called on brother Gideon Step Up step up and do your part something you're interested in to get in the ball game you have to become part of the word to know God's Symphony so we can't just leave our Bible sitting there every morning and get on our Facebook and our Instagram and see how many likes we got of a certain picture and not pick that thing up we're not getting into the word we don't know what's going to happen so we come to church and we open our Bible all week we ain't got a clue what the preacher even talking about because we're not in tune of the symphony we haven't got into the Rhythm we all have a part to play we all have a part to play when you get up on Sunday morning Lord you know who's preaching this morning God they need your help Lord I've been praying I need to send this brother a text like I got a text this morning from my brother early this morning or late last night or whatever you want to say it was the brother was thinking of me I come across his heart thank God because I need it but you can't you cannot be in a rhythm of the word if you're not in it you've got to be a part of it cuz you don't know what I'm talking about this morning if you haven't been all you're wondering about is saying how much more time he's got where's the young people going to eat at after church I hope we don't go to Chipotle that place is nasty get in the Rhythm we'll worry about what we're going to eat when we walk out those doors but right now we got a rhythm we need to be into you're marching to the beat of time you're watching for it the works that I do shall you do also oh mighty says a great changing of time we get into the beat the beat of the word if you get into the word you'll find out how he did it at the beginning how how did Peter say in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk how did the shadow of Peter walk by and people were healed because he got into the music he got into the rhythm of it they had a sheet in their hand what they would do they were trying to look back to a beat they all had a portion had already played out they'd seen it happen before that's what the churches do today they look back and see what part Luther played the lutherans do they don't know the change in the music they didn't know it happened they're stuck back there in just the just shall live by faith and it booed back up into Wesley same thing the Pentecostal are stuck some of his message people are stuck on God's sent a prophet that's all they could see that's sad I know some people like that that all they could see was God sent a prophet they can't see what he said they lost the Rhythm they're not into the Rhythm they don't know the beat but we know the beat we know the time we know how it's supposed to go Brothers musicians come the real word of God falls upon the Vindicated seed and when they see that Vindication of the word they recognize it they're looking at the word they know the junction they know the timing they know the changes they know the Beats that's supposed to be in that hour they know that beat they know how it's supposed to go do you know how it's supposed to go your job might just be that one thing hold off a minute rer your job might be that one thing to do at the end is play the symbol but do it with all your heart play as a team we got to play as a team right what's it mean to play as a team you heard us saying there's no I and team I always say there's a me though leave it to me there's no ey in team when you get on that basketball court it it ain't just you you got four of the people around you you're played with a team they all have a part to play one of them might be a rebounder one of them might be a shooter one of them might be a passer one of them might be a good defensive player but they all have a part to play but if you ain't playing you part heart it'll be a bunch of Racket play something Brothers it'll be a bunch of racket people
