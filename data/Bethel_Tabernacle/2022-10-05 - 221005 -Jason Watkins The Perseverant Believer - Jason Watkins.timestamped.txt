[29:58] the Lord
[30:00] we're going to turn to John's gospel the

[30:31] tonight we've got a few that are out
[30:32] sick
[30:33] want to be remembering brother Mark just
[30:36] about their whole family went down today
[30:37] and it kind of just you know Daisy
[30:40] Chained and went through the whole
[30:41] family and by the time the afternoon was
[30:43] rolling in the devil was just at War but
[30:47] that's okay we're gonna we're gonna
[30:48] strike a counter-offensive back in
[30:51] prayer tonight amen want to pray for
[30:53] them and the other different ones
[30:54] perhaps that aren't able to be here
[30:56] tonight amen Saint John chapter 1.
[31:01] and we'll catch this while you're
[31:02] standing verse 29
[31:05] through 39.
[31:07] when you have it say Amen
[31:11] the next day John seeth Jesus coming
[31:14] unto him in saith
[31:15] Behold the Lamb of God which taketh the
[31:18] way the sin of the world
[31:20] this is he of whom I said after me
[31:22] cometh the man which is preferred before
[31:25] me
[31:26] for he was before me
[31:28] and that amazing
[31:30] because John was actually you know older
[31:33] in In the Flesh he was born ahead of
[31:36] Jesus but he's actually looking at a man
[31:39] he said this was a man and he was
[31:42] actually before me
[31:43] all right and I knew him not
[31:46] but that he should be made manifest to
[31:49] Israel therefore am I come baptizing
[31:51] with water
[31:53] and John bear records saying I saw the
[31:55] Spirit descending from heaven like a
[31:57] dove and at Abode upon him
[32:00] and I knew him not but he that sent me
[32:03] to baptize with water the same said unto
[32:06] me upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit
[32:09] descending and remaining on him
[32:12] the same as he which baptizeth with the
[32:15] Holy Ghost
[32:16] and I saw in Bear record that this is
[32:18] the son of God
[32:20] again the next day after John stood and
[32:23] two of his disciples
[32:25] and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he
[32:28] said Behold the Lamb of God
[32:31] and the two disciples heard him speak
[32:33] and they followed Jesus
[32:35] then Jesus turned and saw them following
[32:38] him saith unto them what seek ye they
[32:41] said in him Rabbi which is to say being
[32:44] interpreted Master where dwellest thou
[32:47] he saith unto them come and see they
[32:50] came and saw where he dwelt and Abode
[32:52] with him that day for it was about the
[32:55] tenth hour wow oh my so much in my heart
[32:58] let's bow our heads father we thank you
[33:02] ever so much Lord for this wonderful
[33:05] time tonight to be in your presence to
[33:08] be here in the house of God to just read
[33:11] your word fills me it Thrills me Lord
[33:13] and fills me with excitement father and
[33:16] I I have just so enjoyed my fellowship
[33:20] with you
[33:21] Lord over these last days and especially
[33:25] all throughout this day Lord to just
[33:27] make sure I had your perfect mind and
[33:29] everything that you wanted to say
[33:31] tonight so now I completely surrender
[33:33] myself to you in Jesus name amen God
[33:37] bless you can be seated
[33:53] when brother Branham preaches on
[33:58] the sermon title perseverance he
[34:00] preaches that
[34:02] excuse me and then he also will preach
[34:06] perseverant
[34:08] and of course in all cases he's taking
[34:10] the same thought
[34:12] but he doesn't begin
[34:14] here in John's gospel he actually begins
[34:17] in the Book of Matthew with the uh the
[34:21] Gentile woman who came to him and uh in
[34:24] Matthew 15 which we'll get to it shortly
[34:27] the woman of tire and sight on so she
[34:30] was the seraphinician woman and that's
[34:33] where he will take his text from and
[34:36] we're gonna we're gonna get to that in
[34:38] the next few minutes thank you for Tony
[34:39] but I but he also covers in those in
[34:43] those sermons and in that thought he
[34:46] will take up John coming baptizing
[34:50] and the reason that brother Branham
[34:53] is going to take John uh during that
[34:57] sermon and where I want to start with it
[34:59] tonight is that John had to be very
[35:02] perseverant John had you know been in
[35:05] the wilderness a long time when God
[35:08] would send him forth he went into the
[35:10] Wilderness we're taught by history at
[35:12] about the age of nine years old seems
[35:15] astonishing but he was a man of the
[35:17] Wilderness and instead of following his
[35:19] father into the priesthood which would
[35:21] have been the normal path but Believers
[35:24] don't normally go normal paths amen the
[35:27] one thing that's normal is we're pretty
[35:29] abnormal
[35:31] amen and uh and we're oddballs and we're
[35:34] nuts but we're screwed to the right Bolt
[35:37] Hallelujah and so you'll do better not
[35:40] trying you ever do one of those things
[35:42] where you're trying to explain something
[35:43] in the the more you try to explain it
[35:45] the worse it becomes don't try to
[35:47] qualify yourself or explain yourself to
[35:49] the world because all you'll do is it'll
[35:50] just get worse and you'll make a mess
[35:51] just say I'm a Believer
[35:53] and I'm I I believe in the Bible and I
[35:56] believe in Christ and that that that
[35:58] just explains everything that's why
[36:00] brother Brandon would say you know we
[36:03] find many people who don't understand
[36:05] how we are so happy and free I've been
[36:08] filled with the spirit there isn't a
[36:10] doubt and that's what's the matter with
[36:12] me
[36:13] and then he sings it that way oh that's
[36:17] what's the matter with me
[36:20] I love hearing him sing that I start
[36:22] singing along to the top of my lungs
[36:24] that's what's the matter with me amen
[36:26] I'm a Believer and so we're following a
[36:29] man who was a Mystic to the world
[36:31] brother I'm said he lived in a realm all
[36:33] to himself in a world all to himself
[36:35] and sometimes even his own disciples
[36:39] didn't understand the things that he did
[36:41] and he said that you don't know what I'm
[36:43] doing now but you'll know afterwards
[36:45] when the Holy Spirit comes he'll remind
[36:46] you of things I've said and it'll all
[36:48] start to make sense to you I'm going to
[36:50] tell you something friends before after
[36:52] you're born again of the spirit of God
[36:53] the gospel makes a whole lot more sense
[36:56] I would just invite you tonight don't
[36:58] struggle just get a new birth and your
[37:02] life will make a whole lot more sense
[37:04] amen praise the Lord also still happy to
[37:07] have sister Amy's family here as well
[37:09] see them also don't want to overlook
[37:11] them amen I bet everybody in here is
[37:12] going
[37:15] amen I'm terrible for that but I wanted
[37:18] to catch them I happened to see them
[37:20] sitting there
[37:21] so you know we we talk about John having
[37:25] to really be perseverant because you
[37:28] know he was in the desert a long time
[37:30] and I mean when you're in the desert
[37:31] your life don't make a whole lot of
[37:33] sense all he knows is I've been sent
[37:35] here and I'm going to have a message
[37:37] someday I'll have a message I mean while
[37:40] he's 12 while he's 16 while he's 19. you
[37:43] know he's just going all along then he's
[37:45] 25 and he's he's carrying on along and
[37:47] then finally one day I mean he's gonna
[37:49] he's gonna come up to his 30th birthday
[37:52] and he's been in the wilderness all
[37:53] these years and all he knows is is that
[37:56] there's going to come one and you're
[37:58] going to forerun him and you're going to
[37:59] go baptizing in water that's really all
[38:02] he knew
[38:04] and and that's why when he comes here
[38:06] you'll find him they say you know who
[38:08] are you what what do you identify what
[38:10] do you say about yourself and really the
[38:12] only thing he could do is just go and
[38:14] say you know I'm not the Messiah no I'm
[38:16] not that I'm not that Prophet you know
[38:18] uh what but yeah what about the one
[38:20] Moses spoke of no that's not me well who
[38:23] are you well I'm the voice of one crying
[38:25] in the wilderness as best I can tell you
[38:27] that's it that's your whole pedigree I'm
[38:29] sorry I lived in the wilderness that's
[38:31] what he told me here I come baptizing
[38:34] and so his life didn't make a whole lot
[38:36] of sense probably to John you can
[38:39] imagine him trying to explain the
[38:41] purpose of his life to to these uh
[38:43] learned men but he knew here's what he
[38:46] knew here's what made him perseverant he
[38:49] did know for sure God spoke to him
[38:53] and sometimes friends as a Believer
[38:56] things come up in our lives and all I
[38:58] can all I know is God spoke to me God
[39:02] called me I can't explain everything it
[39:05] doesn't all make sense even to me and
[39:07] I'm the one lived it but I know I'm here
[39:09] tonight I'm preaching a gospel I'm
[39:12] preaching a sermon because God gave it
[39:14] to me
[39:16] I don't even know what'll happen
[39:18] tomorrow I'm not sure how I survived
[39:21] yesterday
[39:24] but here I am
[39:27] yeah you're going in the Rapture yeah
[39:29] someday oh we've been hearing that well
[39:31] yeah I've been hearing about it too
[39:33] that's been going a long time yeah okay
[39:36] so what do you think I'm a Believer
[39:39] so what are you gonna do I'm going into
[39:40] Rapture oh you still believe that
[39:42] absolutely
[39:44] when will you stop believing that I
[39:46] won't
[39:47] oh I was listening to brother brother
[39:48] Matt sermon here some Services ago when
[39:51] I was away and brother Matt starts
[39:53] talking about you know Malachi Ford he
[39:55] said you say oh when are you going to
[39:57] stop talking about Malachi 4 we're going
[39:59] to stop talking about a prophet he said
[40:00] I'm never going to stop
[40:01] there's nothing else to say that's
[40:03] that's the message to The World God has
[40:06] sent a message and a messenger and it's
[40:09] calling you out to call you up
[40:12] and I'm here to tell you friends like
[40:13] brother Jack Duff says who I'll be
[40:15] ministering for in a few days if you
[40:17] don't hear come out you will never hear
[40:20] come up
[40:22] now I have a keen interest in hearing
[40:24] come up
[40:25] so I'm definitely paying attention to
[40:28] come out
[40:30] amen
[40:33] you know when he talks about John my the
[40:36] things that he had to endure and and he
[40:39] comes out and he's and he he knows
[40:41] enough
[40:42] that when he sees Christ he says there
[40:45] he is
[40:46] build the Lamb of God
[40:48] and he's so sure he says it twice
[40:51] actually three times
[40:53] he says it directly then refers to it
[40:55] then says it directly again and and so
[40:57] so in the mouth of two or three
[40:59] Witnesses and here is a dispensational
[41:01] angel he's a prophet messenger he's not
[41:05] just a prophet John he's more than a
[41:06] prophet as Jesus would say because he's
[41:09] a dispensational messenger see just like
[41:12] we had in this day it was more than just
[41:14] a prophet it was a dispensational angel
[41:16] all right much that just like as Paul
[41:19] went forward
[41:20] so I so so no wonder we quote from it a
[41:24] lot
[41:25] you know what does your mind tell you
[41:27] I'm gonna do of course I'm going to
[41:29] quote from it a lot my whole life is
[41:31] hung upon it
[41:33] so so you know when will I stop telling
[41:37] the world about a message and a
[41:39] messenger When I'm Gone
[41:41] the world won't hear me say it anymore
[41:44] see and so so we find that so I didn't
[41:48] say to the world it's okay you'll be rid
[41:50] of me soon enough
[41:53] so so we so we find that
[41:57] that he goes forward and he's so
[41:59] positive that he says it and then he
[42:02] says it again and then he says it again
[42:04] and he says it to a crowd he says it to
[42:06] people says it to his or his own
[42:08] disciples who he who by this time he
[42:10] loves like his own family these are men
[42:13] who are he's leading their soul they
[42:15] have they're depending their their their
[42:18] banking their soul on him being right
[42:22] you think that doesn't weigh on a man
[42:25] you think that didn't weigh on the
[42:26] messenger of this age you think that
[42:27] doesn't weigh on me you think that
[42:29] doesn't weigh on every Minister we have
[42:30] here knowing that when we get up here
[42:32] people are banking their soul and their
[42:34] children and their family that we're
[42:36] preaching the inerrant word of God I'm
[42:39] here to tell you something friends let
[42:40] me give you an assurance tonight we are
[42:42] preaching the inerrant word of God
[42:45] you say how do you know God proves it
[42:47] because as we preach the word we see it
[42:50] taking effect we see it producing the
[42:52] word in your lives
[42:54] and that's really where my rest is
[43:01] and so you can imagine that
[43:04] after being so positive
[43:07] that he says it and says it again and
[43:09] says it again
[43:11] even says to his disciples stop
[43:12] following me follow him
[43:16] and then he he gets arrested
[43:18] and circumstances change
[43:22] and he's less sure
[43:24] and what has done that brother Brown
[43:26] says his eagle eyes can you imagine that
[43:29] could happen
[43:30] it could happen to a dispensational
[43:32] messenger
[43:35] so you know a lot of times the devil
[43:37] wants to beat us over the head with our
[43:38] with our with our fightings within and
[43:41] fear fightings without and fears within
[43:43] and Paul Paul admitted he had those
[43:45] fightings without we read it here in a
[43:47] little bit and fears within say I'm
[43:49] going to show you that just in a little
[43:50] bit it's not a cakewalk it's not
[43:52] Disneyland we're not going to a picnic
[43:54] as brother Branham said This Is War
[43:57] this is and this is not against flesh
[43:59] and blood that would be easy I can see
[44:02] who I'm shooting at this is invisible
[44:04] powers of the air and I I can't run away
[44:07] from they follow me they even come to
[44:09] church and try to infect my mind and
[44:11] your mind oh I love the preaching of the
[44:14] Gospel you know why because it cast out
[44:16] devils
[44:17] and it drives back spirits of unbelief
[44:20] and for just a little while I'm able to
[44:23] drive every demon away from you and
[44:25] drive them back so the Holy Spirit can
[44:28] come down and deal with you
[44:30] oh you're talking about an authority
[44:32] that I don't take lightly
[44:34] and I'm not afraid of it
[44:37] because I know it's the word and that's
[44:39] when when something's a revealed truth
[44:41] out of the word of God that's perfect
[44:43] Faith Satan can't challenge me on that
[44:45] see
[44:46] it's a perfect peace and perfect faith I
[44:48] know that this word will find God's
[44:52] family and it will perfect them
[44:56] amen
[44:58] but it must have looked doubtful to him
[45:00] when the circumstances of his life got
[45:03] so bad and
[45:04] you know he could he could no longer see
[45:07] Jesus as clearly as he had when he saw
[45:11] him down on the river
[45:13] you know I mean he's in a church service
[45:15] and man the anointing is thick and his
[45:18] brother gathered around him and here
[45:20] comes the Lamb of God and he's seeing
[45:21] the pillar of Fire
[45:23] wow what a change
[45:26] now he doesn't see the pillar of fires
[45:28] Brethren aren't around him he's in a
[45:30] prison locked up in jail
[45:32] and you know and he's he's he's got the
[45:35] bread of Affliction and and and he he
[45:37] starts to wander and starts to get weary
[45:40] I mean it can happen right amen can say
[45:42] Amen to that it can happen
[45:44] you know a lot of times you know when
[45:46] you know when when I don't always see
[45:48] let me say it like this I don't always
[45:50] see in you the same hopeful face that I
[45:54] see when you're sitting here amening the
[45:56] word of God sometimes I run into you in
[45:58] town and I and I and I see a lot of that
[46:01] faith and a lot of that joy and a lot of
[46:03] that perseverance is kind of starting to
[46:05] get weak and I start praying for you and
[46:07] guess what guess what guess what I don't
[46:09] know I don't always look in the mirror
[46:11] and see the same man that I that was
[46:13] standing here and I say man where's that
[46:16] guy that was anointed I'm here to tell
[46:18] you something friends life has a way of
[46:19] doing that
[46:21] that's when you got to be persevering
[46:23] that's when you got to persevere that's
[46:26] when you got to know that he's God and
[46:28] you know that it's his word and you know
[46:30] that you're a Believer and it doesn't
[46:31] even matter what the devil can point to
[46:33] I know I'm a Believer
[46:39] and you're going to have to be
[46:40] persevering in this day or get wiped out
[46:44] because what's released on this age is
[46:46] the spirit of fear Spirit of Madness
[46:48] Spirit of insanity
[46:51] Spirit of perversion there are so many
[46:54] so many twisting
[46:56] influences
[46:58] in the world today
[47:01] want to influence
[47:03] you want to influence your home want to
[47:06] influence your children
[47:09] you know and and and that's why we
[47:12] preach so hard about you know my
[47:15] goodness you should take every possible
[47:17] opportunity to have yourself and your
[47:19] family in the presence of God
[47:22] I mean why why why would you think that
[47:25] everything will be okay if your family
[47:28] only gets to come into this kind of
[47:30] Atmosphere for about an hour and a half
[47:32] once a week
[47:37] I mean that that's that's ridiculous
[47:41] and it's it's irresponsible and you know
[47:44] you you need to think about what's
[47:46] what's really important to you and what
[47:48] you what you really love you know and
[47:51] and it's hard to it's hard for you to
[47:53] convince me that you love your family
[47:56] correctly when I don't see that
[47:58] happening
[48:00] and they don't love unless they don't
[48:02] love them correctly
[48:04] see
[48:05] so because this is there it's more this
[48:10] is more than a social Gathering I want
[48:13] you to absorb that in your mind this is
[48:16] a supernatural experience
[48:18] you're not just here socially this this
[48:22] church building isn't just a gathering
[48:24] hole that you're coming into an
[48:26] atmosphere where people are singing and
[48:28] worshiping and and God promised when
[48:31] that happens he'll start coming down in
[48:33] the midst of that you're here where the
[48:34] word is going to go forth where there's
[48:36] an anointing that literally in a
[48:37] prophet's words flows off of the
[48:39] platform and move down across the people
[48:42] this isn't just like going to Walmart
[48:44] this is coming into the presence of God
[48:47] [Applause]
[48:51] and it's astonishing that everywhere
[48:54] else you go
[48:56] that's not a token applied area is
[48:59] Satan's Eden
[49:02] and people will kill themselves and
[49:06] spend hard-earned money to go everywhere
[49:08] that Satan's Eden is and can hardly come
[49:11] to church for free
[49:16] and come in and have a supernatural
[49:19] experience
[49:24] so so we we think about the
[49:27] circumstances of our lives and the the
[49:29] promised word
[49:32] you know and the precious promises that
[49:34] are are to us and then I think about the
[49:36] world around us and how it's gotten so
[49:38] much worse you know and and very much
[49:41] like John
[49:43] I mean listen everything I just said for
[49:45] the last seven or eight minutes I'm not
[49:46] trying to browbeat you I'm trying to
[49:48] help you
[49:49] I'm trying to get you to open your I'm
[49:51] trying to I'm trying to to take some of
[49:54] the film that film has filmed over some
[49:56] of our eyes like John
[49:59] I mean Rejoice I'm I'm equating you to
[50:03] John
[50:05] I'm not insulting you I'm equating you
[50:07] to John if you're out there listening on
[50:09] the internet I'm equating you to John
[50:12] John's eagle eyes got filmed over when
[50:14] he couldn't go to church
[50:17] John's eagle eyes a dispensational angel
[50:22] got filmed over when he couldn't have
[50:24] the Fellowship of the Saints around him
[50:29] so I mean am I crazy
[50:31] see
[50:32] am I looking at it wrong
[50:34] wrong I don't think I am
[50:37] see so I'm not trying to bralpy to
[50:40] anybody I'm trying to just just preach
[50:42] to you from some common sense
[50:44] this is an evil day
[50:46] news flash it's an evil day
[50:49] it's Satan's Eden he's the god of the
[50:52] evil age
[50:53] see and so so we find then that you know
[50:59] we our lives can come
[51:01] move in this direction just quite
[51:04] naturally just by living
[51:06] but I'm glad that
[51:08] we have an ability like John
[51:11] to have our thinking corrected by the
[51:14] word because when when John sent
[51:18] Messengers to say to him are you
[51:20] actually him I know I said you were
[51:23] and I said it like three times I even
[51:26] sent my own disciples to follow you but
[51:29] are you really him
[51:30] and Jesus Jesus didn't turn around and
[51:33] say yeah John you know come to your
[51:35] senses man here's my here's my card and
[51:38] I'm Jesus Nazareth I'm your cousin and
[51:40] we met down the river you remember that
[51:42] and you baptized me and remember what
[51:44] came out of the sky no he never he never
[51:46] even went back to none of that stuff he
[51:48] just started quoting the word at what
[51:50] his ministry was supposed to do he said
[51:52] when you go back and see John tell him
[51:54] that the gospel is being preached and
[51:55] the blinded eyes are being opened and
[51:57] the and the and the great things of God
[51:59] and the power of God is moving in the
[52:01] people and Israel is being restored and
[52:04] when John all John needed to hear was
[52:06] yeah that's right it's the word of God
[52:09] yeah he is the Lamb of God I'm here
[52:11] today coming friends take courage
[52:13] because because this word is being
[52:15] fulfilled and the Very promises that
[52:18] were given to this age not I mean I can
[52:21] see the what what the what the prophecy
[52:24] was concerning the world
[52:26] I can see all of those prophecies coming
[52:29] to pass and I also know there was a
[52:31] precious promises uh to the family of
[52:33] God fear not little children it's your
[52:36] father's pleasure to give you the
[52:38] kingdom I know the world is going to
[52:40] pieces I know that it's Satan's Eden but
[52:43] it's the father's pleasure to give you
[52:45] the kingdom
[52:48] there is power in prayer and there's
[52:51] power in the blood
[52:52] and you can rely on it and let me
[52:55] encourage you tonight you can depend on
[52:57] it let me let me say this you can draw
[52:59] from it if you need some dividends
[53:01] tonight your perseverance is a little
[53:03] low and your eagle eyes are filmed over
[53:05] oh let me encourage you by the word of
[53:07] God it's coming to pass
[53:11] all around us we see it happening it
[53:13] gets confirmed to me every day of my
[53:15] life
[53:15] [Music]
[53:18] this message is so far beyond question
[53:21] to me because I see it operating every
[53:24] day every day
[53:31] so we can hear the same confirmation
[53:33] come back like John did
[53:35] this movement is scriptural
[53:38] and it is producing
[53:40] what it said
[53:44] regardless
[53:46] and and
[53:47] sometimes
[53:49] I can find my own self going wow I think
[53:52] yeah okay it's producing in everybody
[53:54] but me anybody anybody been there
[53:58] yes sir so Bill Jason never would have
[54:00] imagined you why who you think I am
[54:02] like Superman only sister Debbie thinks
[54:06] that
[54:08] and my grandkids
[54:11] but I'm actually just a mortal
[54:16] with an immortal Gene
[54:19] had a super faith I have a super seed oh
[54:22] man and I have a perfect faith in it
[54:27] hmm
[54:29] uh Hey Z go to Romans 8 honey uh Romans
[54:34] 8 and we're gonna go 35 to 37. hey man
[54:39] got some girl power going on in the
[54:40] booth
[54:42] now I want you to look at Paul
[54:44] here's here's here's the Apostle Paul in
[54:46] Romans 8 35-37 who shall separate us
[54:50] from the love of Christ
[54:51] shall tribulation or distress or
[54:53] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[54:56] Peril or sword as it is written for thy
[54:59] sake we are killed all the day long
[55:02] we are accounted as sheep for the
[55:05] slaughter wait a minute Paul I thought
[55:06] what happened to love I thought you were
[55:08] just talking about the love of Christ
[55:09] it's not the turn I expected
[55:14] although we're going to talk about the
[55:15] love of God who's being killed all day
[55:18] and who's a sheep for the slaughter
[55:20] me and you
[55:23] see I want to know him in the power of
[55:25] his resurrection
[55:26] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[55:30] being made conformable unto his death
[55:33] nay verse 37 and all these things in all
[55:37] of what things being killed all the day
[55:39] long being being accounted as sheep for
[55:41] the slaughter it doesn't matter
[55:44] it doesn't matter you say I feel like
[55:46] I'm being slaughtered it doesn't matter
[55:48] you're gonna win anyhow
[55:50] all you got to do is have perseverance
[55:52] all you got to do is press
[55:54] that word Paul said we press toward a
[55:57] Mark that means we strain at it we
[55:59] stretch we're reaching I'm pressing I'm
[56:02] not sitting back on the couch with the
[56:04] remote I'm actually straining and
[56:06] pressing to take a hold of something
[56:09] [Applause]
[56:12] now in all these things we are more than
[56:14] conquerors
[56:16] I'm being killed all the day long and
[56:19] I'm a conqueror exactly I'm accounted at
[56:22] sheep for the slaughter but I'm a
[56:23] conqueror precisely how because God
[56:27] loved me
[56:28] and nothing can separate me from that
[56:30] love
[56:32] he comes to the Corinthian Church Second
[56:34] Corinthians chapter 11.
[56:37] Zoe second Corinthians 11 we're going to
[56:40] get 21-33 I just want you to I just I'm
[56:42] just going to give you a reality check
[56:44] to show you that Paul's life wasn't a
[56:46] bed of roses
[56:48] I speak as concerning report now the
[56:51] Paul is responding to people who went
[56:54] around tooting their own horn that they
[56:56] were something super and Paul was pretty
[56:58] much nothing
[56:59] Paul says I speak as concerning reproach
[57:02] as though we had been weak how be it
[57:04] when so ever any is bold I speak
[57:07] foolishly I am bold also are they
[57:09] Hebrews so am I are they Israelites so
[57:12] am I are they the Seed of Abraham so am
[57:15] I are they Ministers of Christ I speak
[57:18] as a fool I'm more
[57:20] in Labor's more abundant and Stripes
[57:23] above measure in prisons more frequent
[57:26] in deaths often of the Jews five times
[57:30] received I-40 Stripes saved one
[57:34] Thrice was I beaten with rods once I was
[57:37] stoned Thrice I suffered shipwreck a
[57:40] night and a day I have been in the Deep
[57:43] and journeyings often in Perils of
[57:45] waters and Perils of robbers and Perils
[57:47] of my own countrymen and Perils of the
[57:49] Heathen and pales in the city and perils
[57:52] in the wilderness and perils in the sea
[57:53] and perils among false Brethren and
[57:56] weariness and painfulness and watchings
[57:57] often and hunger and thirst and fastings
[57:59] often in gold and nakedness
[58:02] this calls for perseverance
[58:06] besides you know as if I haven't already

[58:11] those things that are without

[58:25] the things which concern mine
[58:26] infirmities I'm going to glory in my
[58:29] infirmities I'm not going to toot my own
[58:32] horn and talk about some great track
[58:34] record I've got I'm going to Glory that
[58:37] I've been counted worthy to suffer and
[58:40] build my character and I'm more
[58:42] perseverant today than I was before I
[58:45] suffer those things
[58:49] if I must need score verse 35 I must
[58:51] needs Glory I will glory of the things
[58:53] which concern mine infirmities
[58:55] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[58:57] Christ who is blessed forevermore
[58:59] knoweth than I lie not in Damascus at
[59:03] the governor under art artist the king
[59:05] kept the city of the of the Damascus
[59:07] sins with the Garrison desirous to
[59:10] apprehend me and through a window in a
[59:13] basket was I let down by the wall and
[59:15] escaped his hands I've been to that
[59:16] window
[59:18] I saw the field where our poor brother
[59:21] ran for his life
[59:22] I've walked the street straight I know
[59:24] they were hunting for him and here he is
[59:27] I mean Lord are you kidding I've had all
[59:29] I've had these Stripes this many times
[59:31] I've been in the The Deep a night in the
[59:33] day I've I've suffered robbers and
[59:34] perils and my countrymen and all these
[59:36] things and now here I am in Damascus the
[59:39] place you sent me to and they're coming
[59:41] to kill me and and I got to suffer the
[59:43] indignity I can't even walk out like a
[59:45] man I got to be lowered in a basket like
[59:48] a like a criminal and run off into the
[59:50] darkness and try to find my way
[59:53] man
[59:56] this calls for perseverance
[59:59] I want to tell you some friends let me
[1:00:00] encourage you tonight be perseverant
[1:00:03] this isn't a picnic this isn't a
[1:00:06] vacation this is an exercise in
[1:00:08] spiritual lifestyle this this is this is
[1:00:11] you're not as as brother Ernie used to
[1:00:13] say you're you're not uh uh um uh you're
[1:00:17] not a
[1:00:18] natural person having a supernatural
[1:00:22] experience you're a supernatural person
[1:00:25] having a natural experience
[1:00:28] say how do you get to your supernatural
[1:00:30] being because I was in God before the
[1:00:32] foundation of the world when morning
[1:00:34] Stars sang together and sons of God
[1:00:37] shouted for Joy when they gathered
[1:00:39] around the throne
[1:00:42] oh my
[1:00:47] God second Corinthians 1 chapter 1 7 to
[1:00:51] 10 see
[1:00:52] verse 7
[1:00:55] and our hope of you is steadfast knowing
[1:00:57] that is your partakers of the sufferings
[1:01:00] so shall you be also of the consolation
[1:01:03] isn't that wonderful
[1:01:04] for we would not Brethren II Corinthians
[1:01:07] 1 8 for we would not Brethren have you
[1:01:09] ignorant of our trouble
[1:01:11] which came to us in Asia that we were
[1:01:15] pressed out of measure
[1:01:19] above strength
[1:01:21] and so much
[1:01:24] we despaired even of life
[1:01:28] let me tell you something this is Saint
[1:01:30] Paul
[1:01:31] this is Saint Paul being vulnerable
[1:01:34] and saying to you it happens to the best
[1:01:38] of us
[1:01:40] to those who you would think it's
[1:01:42] impossible that Paul could ever get that
[1:01:44] way where's his faith where was John's
[1:01:47] where's yours at time where's mine
[1:01:49] see
[1:01:51] and he says it was I was so pressed out
[1:01:54] of measures so above strength it had
[1:01:58] went so beyond my ability to survive and
[1:02:01] so much that we despaired even of life
[1:02:04] verse 9 we had the sentence of death in
[1:02:08] ourselves
[1:02:09] that we should not trust in ourselves
[1:02:11] but in God which raiseth the Dead who
[1:02:16] delivered us from so great of death and
[1:02:18] death delivery in whom we trust that he
[1:02:20] will yet Deliver Us I'm here to tell you
[1:02:22] something friends God has a way of
[1:02:25] getting you to not trust you
[1:02:28] God has a way of getting you not to fall
[1:02:30] back on your own resources and try to
[1:02:32] make your own way God God doesn't want
[1:02:35] that God wants you to depend upon him
[1:02:37] and and life comes I'm here to tell you
[1:02:40] that the beauty of that is this in fact
[1:02:42] is this is exactly why that this works
[1:02:46] is what bewilders Satan
[1:02:49] because he cannot put two and two
[1:02:52] together and get it to come out he can't
[1:02:54] write this in an equation on his board
[1:02:56] that that the the more he powers on you
[1:02:59] the stronger you get
[1:03:01] the harder he makes it the more you love
[1:03:04] God
[1:03:05] the more you suffer the more faith you
[1:03:07] have
[1:03:09] I told you a bunch of weirdos I told you
[1:03:11] you're not normal I'm here to tell you
[1:03:13] something friends I'm only not normal
[1:03:15] because I'm not of this world
[1:03:18] I Come From Another World I come from
[1:03:20] God I'm going back to God
[1:03:23] Hallelujah
[1:03:27] brother Branham comes to Matthew 15. he
[1:03:30] picks up this Greek woman
[1:03:32] Matthew 15 21 to 28 then Jesus went
[1:03:36] thence and departed into the coast of
[1:03:37] terenceidon
[1:03:39] I'm doing good on time is you with me
[1:03:43] I'm tired and sidon
[1:03:45] Behold a woman of Canaan came out of the
[1:03:47] same coast and cried in him saying have
[1:03:49] mercy on me O Lord thou son of David
[1:03:52] my daughter is grievously vexed with the
[1:03:54] devil but he answered her not a word and
[1:03:55] his disciples came and beside him saying
[1:03:57] send her away for she cries after us
[1:04:00] but he answered and said I'm not sent
[1:04:01] but until the lost sheep of the House of
[1:04:04] Israel then came she and worshiped him
[1:04:07] saying Lord help me
[1:04:10] but he answered and said it is not me to
[1:04:13] take the children's bread and to cast it
[1:04:15] to dogs
[1:04:17] it's pretty tough
[1:04:19] that's Politically Incorrect
[1:04:23] brother Brandon said you Pentecostals he
[1:04:25] said man somebody would have treated you
[1:04:27] like that you'd have took your papers
[1:04:28] and went to the next Church down the
[1:04:30] street
[1:04:31] said I don't have to sit here and listen
[1:04:32] to this idiot
[1:04:34] and brother Brandon brother Brown talked
[1:04:36] about yet you know relating it that
[1:04:37] people couldn't even stay and hear the
[1:04:38] word of God verse 27
[1:04:42] and she says truth Lord
[1:04:44] yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which
[1:04:46] fall from the master's table
[1:04:48] then Jesus answered and said unto her
[1:04:51] old woman great is thy faith be it unto
[1:04:54] thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter
[1:04:56] was made whole from that very hour
[1:05:01] brother Branham when he starts to tell
[1:05:03] the story about this woman
[1:05:05] he starts talking about the secret to
[1:05:07] Dueling faith
[1:05:09] and you know that's what faith really is
[1:05:12] it's a constant duel it's like a sword
[1:05:14] fight
[1:05:15] and and brother Branham talks about you
[1:05:17] know that you've got a you've got a
[1:05:19] sword of the word
[1:05:21] and but the devil's also got a sword
[1:05:23] right because he comes with a sword
[1:05:25] remember in the seals he comes with a
[1:05:27] sword and brother Brennan said we find
[1:05:28] out he gets killed by that sword see
[1:05:31] it's sharp two-edged sword puts him
[1:05:33] right down
[1:05:34] and so brother brennaman describing this
[1:05:36] Warfare he says but if you believe it
[1:05:39] see these swords come right straight
[1:05:41] down to the handles and now if I in a
[1:05:44] duel if I can push his back with my
[1:05:47] handle the handle's locked I'm aiming
[1:05:49] for his heart he's aiming for mine and
[1:05:51] our handles lock and he said now it's
[1:05:53] just the strength of the man's arm who
[1:05:56] can push who sword into whose chest yeah
[1:05:58] you follow me
[1:05:59] so you say well I'm just going to Parry
[1:06:02] and move no I'm going to tell you
[1:06:03] something sometimes life gets you in a
[1:06:05] fix where you can't move left or right
[1:06:08] you can't go forward or back up and the
[1:06:10] only thing you better have at that point
[1:06:12] is an arm of Faith to take the sword of
[1:06:15] the spirit and put that enemy down
[1:06:18] Hallelujah say how am I going to do that
[1:06:20] I'm glad you asked listen to brother
[1:06:22] Branham he says now
[1:06:25] if I can push his back with my handle
[1:06:27] the blade like that where am I at I'm
[1:06:31] directed right straight to his heart
[1:06:36] oh sometimes
[1:06:39] we stab at the Devil but we don't really
[1:06:42] stab at his heart
[1:06:44] because really what he's come with in
[1:06:47] our lives we kind of like it
[1:06:50] but it's caused us some problems and so
[1:06:52] we'd like to wound him
[1:06:54] just to kind of back him up a little bit
[1:06:56] but don't go away I don't really want to
[1:06:58] kill you
[1:07:01] because I kind of like what's going on
[1:07:03] here but I don't like the trouble that's
[1:07:05] causing me I remember brother Matt
[1:07:07] preaching one time about the difference
[1:07:08] between somebody repenting for the
[1:07:11] consequence of the sin rather than
[1:07:13] repenting for the sin
[1:07:16] people a lot of times are very sorry
[1:07:17] over the consequence of what sin has got
[1:07:20] him into but they're really not ready to
[1:07:23] get rid of the sin
[1:07:24] and they just kind of want to breather
[1:07:26] kind of want to reprieve
[1:07:28] see
[1:07:30] he says now if I can push his back with
[1:07:32] my hand the blade like that then I'm I'm
[1:07:35] directed right straight to his heart
[1:07:38] because I'm on the right side at his
[1:07:40] left and and then when I'm pressing with
[1:07:43] faith with the word see now you get the
[1:07:47] picture this is a metaphorically it's a
[1:07:50] sword fight what it is is you say it's a
[1:07:53] sword it's a metaphorical hand pushing a
[1:07:55] metaphorical sword into a real devil
[1:07:58] because it's not just a a metaphor it's
[1:08:02] actually a reality and the arm is an arm
[1:08:06] of faith and the sword is the word
[1:08:09] directed by the spirit so you can put it
[1:08:11] in his heart
[1:08:13] that's what you need to do I'm here to
[1:08:15] tell you some things that we have
[1:08:17] repeating in our life is because you've
[1:08:18] never put it to his heart
[1:08:21] but I want you to know you're entitled
[1:08:23] to do that you're entitled to put it to
[1:08:26] his heart you don't just have to wound
[1:08:27] him he'll just come back
[1:08:30] put it in his heart tonight whatever's
[1:08:32] held you back in your life from
[1:08:34] believing all of God put it in his heart
[1:08:36] and put him down forever
[1:08:38] [Applause]
[1:08:42] and then when I'm pressing with faith
[1:08:44] with the word Satan Jesus Christ
[1:08:47] commissioned me to do this and we lock
[1:08:50] see
[1:08:51] and so and raise up with that hand of
[1:08:55] faith
[1:08:56] and say and here's brother Brandon
[1:08:58] because of his personal testimony we've
[1:09:00] all got our own personal line we could
[1:09:02] use here's his an angel of God met me
[1:09:06] Yonder and said it so the first thing
[1:09:09] you know throws the sword right straight
[1:09:11] in and he's conquered I come to
[1:09:13] challenge you and thus saith the Lord
[1:09:15] that's the believer when he has Faith to
[1:09:19] handle the word I'm here to tell you
[1:09:21] something that's what brother Branham
[1:09:22] says in the fourth seal that he says you
[1:09:25] wait till that group comes that that
[1:09:27] seven Thunder Group that can and brother
[1:09:29] Branham doesn't say handle the word
[1:09:32] go look at it go listen to the team he
[1:09:34] doesn't say handle it he says that group
[1:09:37] that can hand it
[1:09:39] in other words I can put it in my hand
[1:09:41] and I can duel and I can shove it into
[1:09:43] the heart of the enemy I'm a capable
[1:09:45] wire because I've I've said in the
[1:09:48] presence of the mighty king
[1:09:53] he says this poor little woman she had
[1:09:55] never seen him but she had heard of him
[1:09:57] she had many hindrances
[1:09:59] I love this statement
[1:10:01] she had many hindrances but her faith
[1:10:04] didn't have any hindrances
[1:10:06] catch this now Faith don't have any
[1:10:09] hindrances at all
[1:10:11] not faith
[1:10:12] see she had hindrances it's going to
[1:10:15] prove to you here in just in a minute
[1:10:16] I'll give you a little preview of what's
[1:10:18] coming
[1:10:19] brother Brown is going to prove that
[1:10:21] faith and your and the things that are
[1:10:24] hindering you
[1:10:25] are are different
[1:10:27] you see because she had hindrances talks
[1:10:30] Hey brother I'm goes into a whole list
[1:10:31] you know her church was against her
[1:10:33] going to see him her husband was against
[1:10:35] her going to see him the neighbors her
[1:10:37] social parties were against him against
[1:10:39] her she had her own internal fears and
[1:10:41] questions and wonderings she's now got a
[1:10:43] got to be insulted and almost spit in
[1:10:46] the face and she's got to overcome all
[1:10:48] of those human emotions and hindrances
[1:10:50] there are people that can't even hear
[1:10:52] God say to them about how they should
[1:10:55] dress
[1:10:57] there are women who get modern matter
[1:10:59] than a firecracker when you start
[1:11:01] talking about Holiness about how women
[1:11:04] should dress and how she shouldn't dress
[1:11:05] are men how they shouldn't run around
[1:11:07] town dressed in certain ways or act
[1:11:09] certain ways or say certain things and
[1:11:10] they will get so mad they want to fight
[1:11:12] you
[1:11:14] this woman had to almost have her face
[1:11:16] spit in and yet she kept the right
[1:11:18] attitude and said truth Lord in other
[1:11:20] words you said I'm a dog you're not
[1:11:22] wrong
[1:11:23] truth I'm Unworthy of this but
[1:11:26] nonetheless I'm so desperate how they
[1:11:29] even the dogs eat the crumbs from the
[1:11:30] master's table now you've got that kind
[1:11:33] of attitude friends I'm here to tell you
[1:11:34] that's when you'll move God on your
[1:11:36] behalf
[1:11:37] that's when you'll move God on your own
[1:11:39] behalf when all you do is sit back and
[1:11:42] get mad and want to call a preacher and
[1:11:44] tell him off or text him and tell him
[1:11:46] off or you know come see him and tell
[1:11:48] him off then you're never going to get
[1:11:50] what this woman got I'm sorry that's the
[1:11:53] reality you're never going to get what
[1:11:55] this woman got see
[1:11:59] says this poor little woman she had
[1:12:01] plenty of hindrances
[1:12:03] but her faith didn't have any hindrances
[1:12:05] because Faith don't have any hindrances
[1:12:07] at all
[1:12:08] you might have a lot of hindrances
[1:12:11] you might have a doctor's word
[1:12:13] scientific man who's examined who it
[1:12:15] might be that man told you you're going
[1:12:16] to die that's all he knows he told you
[1:12:19] all he studied his scientific work shows
[1:12:21] that you must die your whole system is
[1:12:23] made in that kind of a way that death
[1:12:25] has struck it and there's nothing can
[1:12:27] keep it from going on you're going now
[1:12:29] that's as much as he knows no science
[1:12:31] has no medicine for it but you have
[1:12:34] found something
[1:12:36] you pick up the sword see of course
[1:12:40] you've got a hindrance of course you've
[1:12:42] got a hindrance you've got something
[1:12:44] that's going to duel against you the
[1:12:48] devil that disease that Affliction
[1:12:50] sometimes friends you can go for a long
[1:12:53] time and your whole life is just made up
[1:12:56] of a duel of the devil or a disease or
[1:13:00] an Affliction but I want you to know
[1:13:02] this word has the answer for a devil or
[1:13:05] a disease or an Affliction this is a
[1:13:07] bride who's going to come overcome every
[1:13:09] devil and every disease and every
[1:13:12] Affliction and Satan's Eden is not going
[1:13:14] to hold me back I'm going to conquer
[1:13:16] every devil and every disease and every
[1:13:19] affliction
[1:13:21] foreign
[1:13:23] when you strike the tip of the swords
[1:13:25] with that devil Yonder say thus saith
[1:13:27] the Lord he revealed to me and I am
[1:13:30] healed oh my your faith don't have any
[1:13:32] hindrances oh friends can you realize
[1:13:35] that tonight there's where perseverance
[1:13:37] lays is that my faith does not have any
[1:13:42] hindrances it's been revealed to me what
[1:13:45] God is doing in my life if God promised
[1:13:48] me that if I would surrender he'd fill
[1:13:50] me full of his life and he would take
[1:13:51] away the desires of the world and guess
[1:13:53] what he did I I did it he did it here I
[1:13:56] am
[1:13:57] Hallelujah he told me he warned me the
[1:14:00] world would go crazy but he promised me
[1:14:02] his mind and I've got it
[1:14:05] and I know it's true
[1:14:09] she had hindrances but not her faith so
[1:14:12] her faith is something more than her
[1:14:15] her faith is beyond her it was a
[1:14:18] revelation given by God that drove her
[1:14:22] past all her hindrances
[1:14:25] perseverance the hindrance his brother
[1:14:27] Branham listed were outside of her
[1:14:30] some of them were within her Paul picks
[1:14:33] that up so he gave me second Corinthians
[1:14:36] chapter 7.
[1:14:38] Paul Thomas let's let's look at some
[1:14:40] more reality check about Saint Paul just
[1:14:42] so you know he wasn't on holiday
[1:14:46] second Corinthians 7 4 and 7 4-7

[1:14:53] you
[1:14:54] great is my glorying of you
[1:14:57] I am filled with Comfort savior this
[1:14:59] sounds pretty good I am exceeding joyful
[1:15:02] in all our tribulation
[1:15:05] for when we were coming to Macedonia our
[1:15:09] flesh had no rest but we were troubled
[1:15:12] on every side without were fightings
[1:15:16] within were fears
[1:15:19] think about that friends can you relate
[1:15:21] to that can you say I get it Paul I've
[1:15:23] been right there I was there all day
[1:15:25] today fightings without I've troubled on
[1:15:28] every side all I want to do is finish my
[1:15:31] day and love my family and go to church
[1:15:33] and worship God but I've had troubles on
[1:15:35] all sides I've got fightings everywhere
[1:15:37] I turn I got fears within me say what
[1:15:40] kind of fears you got you know am I
[1:15:42] making the grade am I good enough am I
[1:15:44] righteous enough does God really love me
[1:15:46] come on friends this is this is Paul
[1:15:49] being a human this is Paul being
[1:15:51] vulnerable are you willing to say me too
[1:15:54] me too I have all kinds of trouble on
[1:15:57] every side and fightings without it I
[1:15:59] got a lot of fears within but look what
[1:16:01] he says nevertheless verse six
[1:16:02] nevertheless God that comforted those
[1:16:06] that are cast down comforted Us by the
[1:16:08] coming of Titus and not by his coming
[1:16:11] only but by the consolation wherewith he
[1:16:13] was comforted in you when he told us of
[1:16:15] your earnest desire your mourning your
[1:16:17] fervent mind toward me so that I
[1:16:20] rejoiced the more it didn't matter how
[1:16:23] bad Satan troubled him all Paul had to
[1:16:26] hear was there are people who believe in
[1:16:28] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:30] oh that's reward enough for me friends I
[1:16:33] don't need plotted from the world as
[1:16:35] long as I know you love the Lord Jesus
[1:16:37] Christ
[1:16:38] I can face every demon I can fight every
[1:16:42] tool as long as I know I got people who
[1:16:45] love God and who want more of his word
[1:16:47] and who are willing to be perseverant
[1:16:50] young people who are willing to stand up
[1:16:52] and say brother Jason we're with you
[1:16:54] we're marching to Zion married couples
[1:16:56] who say we're with you we're marching to
[1:16:59] Zion
[1:17:00] [Applause]
[1:17:02] how about on the internet are you
[1:17:04] willing to march on to Zion
[1:17:16] brother Brandon makes a tremendous point
[1:17:19] he says listen you say
[1:17:21] well
[1:17:24] but man this problem and
[1:17:26] that problem and
[1:17:27] yeah I get it mother Jason I'm excited
[1:17:29] this is a great place to be tonight
[1:17:32] and I'm a Believer too
[1:17:34] but you know the bottom line is let's
[1:17:36] just be real I got this problem here and
[1:17:38] this one here
[1:17:40] this one over here and I'm still gonna
[1:17:42] have to face them tomorrow you know
[1:17:46] well first of all I think I've shown you
[1:17:48] you're not alone
[1:17:51] I think I have shown you from the days
[1:17:53] of Paul till today till tonight we are
[1:17:56] all in this thing together
[1:17:58] I started yet John the Baptist and
[1:18:00] brought you through Jesus we didn't talk
[1:18:01] about his torment
[1:18:03] and then we get to Paul and Paul's
[1:18:05] writing all of these places Hey listen
[1:18:07] this ain't a picnic this ain't a
[1:18:09] vacation uh you know I'm not I'm not a
[1:18:12] holiday in sightseeing I got trouble on
[1:18:14] every side and I got people trying to
[1:18:16] kill me and and I go I'm pressed beyond
[1:18:18] measure and I got fightings without and
[1:18:20] fears Within
[1:18:24] but brother Branham said
[1:18:26] yeah you got all these you got all these
[1:18:28] hindrances but just remember
[1:18:32] you've already
[1:18:33] already overcome the biggest hindrance
[1:18:36] say which one was that you got born
[1:18:39] again
[1:18:40] you're talking about impossible that's
[1:18:43] impossible because the Fallen mind is
[1:18:46] enmity against God and can never agree
[1:18:48] with God's word you came into this world
[1:18:50] dying with no way to save yourself and
[1:18:53] nobody in heaven or Earth could save you
[1:18:55] but God rich in Mercy offered you
[1:18:59] himself and you took the deal
[1:19:02] Hallelujah you took the deal and said oh
[1:19:05] I'll take the way with the Lord's
[1:19:06] despised you and what did it do it
[1:19:09] changed your nature and the old man died
[1:19:11] and you're loving God tonight I'm here
[1:19:14] to tell you if you put all the rest of
[1:19:16] your hindrances in a box they would not
[1:19:18] equal what you've already accomplished
[1:19:21] [Applause]
[1:19:24] so now let me say to you it's worth
[1:19:26] pressing it's worth persevering I want
[1:19:30] to tell you tonight press the battle
[1:19:31] it's worth it you're already winning
[1:19:35] [Applause]
[1:19:37] Hallelujah
[1:19:39] brother Branham said faith
[1:19:42] see
[1:19:44] it's this this approach of faith and the
[1:19:47] application of allowing God's grace to
[1:19:49] do what it does which is
[1:19:51] produce perfect faith in you
[1:19:54] these These hindrances are on purpose
[1:19:57] they're planted
[1:20:00] you're set up
[1:20:02] because God is growing you and
[1:20:04] strengthening you
[1:20:06] see you've already beat the one that
[1:20:08] counts
[1:20:10] and once you beat that one nothing else
[1:20:12] counts anyway
[1:20:16] brother Branham said somehow somehow
[1:20:19] somehow
[1:20:21] faith
[1:20:22] finds a source
[1:20:24] but others don't see
[1:20:27] I just about took a run when I read that
[1:20:30] brother man says faith finds a source
[1:20:34] can you relate to that tonight I've been
[1:20:38] so many cases in my life so many times
[1:20:40] so many situations there was no way out
[1:20:43] there was no way over it no way around
[1:20:46] it no way under it couldn't get through
[1:20:47] it completely cut off and trapped but
[1:20:50] Faith found a source say how did you
[1:20:53] find it I don't even know it wasn't
[1:20:55] natural it was Supernatural
[1:20:58] Faith finds a source that others don't
[1:21:02] see
[1:21:03] she had many hindrances this little
[1:21:05] greek woman
[1:21:07] but her faith didn't have any
[1:21:09] he repeats it Faith don't have any
[1:21:12] hindrances at all
[1:21:14] listen to this statement you believe a
[1:21:16] prophet

[1:21:53] what anybody else says

[1:34:58] sure maybe you want to raise up your
[1:34:59] hand to the Lord say father remember me
[1:35:02] you think listen brother Brian that when
[1:35:04] you raise that hand that's not that's
[1:35:06] not just a form
[1:35:08] that further answer that means something
[1:35:10] God actually sees that see and that
[1:35:13] that's a that's a testament to God that
[1:35:15] underneath that hand there's a real need
[1:35:17] amen let's go to our
[1:35:20] bow our heads and go to the Lord in
[1:35:22] prayer
[1:35:24] prayer father the one
[1:35:27] tonight there's one thing left to do and
[1:35:30] that's to thank you
[1:35:31] thank you for your love
[1:35:34] thank you Lord for your mercy on our
[1:35:36] lives
[1:35:37] I stand here tonight father and my heart
[1:35:40] I've emptied out my whole burden
[1:35:43] and I just feel so delivered of this
[1:35:45] burden for the people
[1:35:47] and I I stand here tonight Lord with a
[1:35:50] it with and I'm hard-pressed to explain
[1:35:53] the feeling of confidence I feel because
[1:35:55] I know as I stand here right now I don't
[1:35:58] have a clue what tomorrow holds for me
[1:36:00] or these people but I already know your
[1:36:03] word is true and I'm going to believe it
[1:36:05] tomorrow as much as I believe it today
[1:36:07] and the next day I'm going to continue
[1:36:09] to believe it and Lord no matter I've
[1:36:12] got this hindrance and this fight and
[1:36:14] this thing going on but I found out in
[1:36:16] the word hey I'm supposed to have those
[1:36:18] things they're for my perfecting they're
[1:36:21] to make me strong they're to God you're
[1:36:23] you're defeating the devil you've you've
[1:36:25] given us the privilege
[1:36:28] to defeat the enemy our enemy and your
[1:36:30] enemy on your behalf
[1:36:33] you lived here Lord as a human man and
[1:36:35] you defeated him on every turn
[1:36:38] now you've come back again in flesh and
[1:36:40] you're walking the Earth and a bride a
[1:36:42] many membered bride around the world and
[1:36:44] once again you're defeating the devil at
[1:36:46] every turn
[1:36:48] even things that to him may look like
[1:36:51] victories to him and he may try to tell
[1:36:53] us that their defeats for us but that's
[1:36:55] just a lie that's that's impossible Lord
[1:36:58] there's no condemnation to them which
[1:37:00] are in Christ it's not even possible
[1:37:03] so let us keep the right mental attitude
