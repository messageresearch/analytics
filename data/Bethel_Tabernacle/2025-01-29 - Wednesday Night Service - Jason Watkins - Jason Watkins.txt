to have you in the house of God tonight we want to um okay good deal so they're working on a microphone so we'll just let them carry on going to invite you to Matthew chap 11 this evening amen I want to continue on from Sunday this will be the fifth installment amen I guess I should say I'm continuing on from last year amen we're carrying on and the Lord just continues to open it and and so we're just going to keep going down the you always follow the hottest Trail amen lots of things you're never at a loss for something to preach or something to say the message is a bottomless well it's just so rich and so deep and so vast um but U we want to have exactly what the mind of the Lord is that's what I want friends amen amen I tell you what the uh the enemy has sure tried to battle me today and uh this has been one of those days where I have had the advantage of years of discipline of trusting God Amen I tell you what and so I brought it I brought years of experience to Bear today and I just said Satan you are wasting your time I know what the Lord has promised I know this is his word I know this is what what he once said amen so I'm just going to carry on and and sure enough um right before uh in the later afternoon I finally began to uh like brother Bosworth said that time said one time he said I was supposed to preach and and and and and something downtown and down a street and he said I was laying in the bed all that night sick and he said I was so sick and he said I I went delirious and he said I would pass out and he said every time I would wake up he said I would come conscious just long enough to say devil you're a liar and he said I'd faint again and he said I'd wake up again a few hours later sweating devil you're a liar and he said I'd pass out again he did that all night he said I just kept waking up calling him a liar said by morning's light the devil got discouraged and left me and he said I went on and did what I was supposed to do amen so I'm just saying I I believe I discouraged him today amen we're going to look into the word of God in Chapter 11 11th chapter of Matthew's gospel I want to uh invite you to begin at verse 27 amen praise the Lord Matthew chap 11 verse 27 all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen let's pray Master having read your word we know there's a blessing in reading it we know there's a blessing in hearing it read so we are looking to you now father and I cast down lord every contrary uh notion that the enemy would have and Lord we're here father at under your leadership to preach the word of God and I pray tonight that Lord it will it will be within me perhaps Lord we will all leave here tonight I know I know I have certainly felt this that John said it was indeed it was sweet in my mouth but it was bitter in my belly and so I pray tonight Lord that whatever is the case you will allow us to assimilate this word so that it can become a part of us we are determined to be Overcomers and be your people in this age we are determined to be the final voice as you have ordained to this final age and Lord the end enemy it's all he's already too late Lord he cannot win so we're asking for your help tonight in Jesus name amen God bless you friend you can be seated brother brandom comes to a message that he titled life it's a very good message so wonderful brother brandham is preaching it from the real depths of his heart one of those heart grabbing type of sermons 1957 he calls it life and he asked this question you know speaking in in his sermon he says someone has asked the question who is this great Jehovah and where did he begin at he says he had no beginning he was forever God now the word forever just means a space of time but eternity means forever but forever the word forever in Hebrew means a space lotted time for it's in plural forever and forever that means to Forever see but in eternity is one complete eternity a circle that that has no end so it has no beginning and it has no end it never had a beginning and it never will have an end and how that in the world we know that there is a real true Spirit of Love there is a real true Spirit of Love there is a real true Spirit of loyalty amen there is a real true Spirit of honesty now if there's a true Spirit of love then there's a fake one if there's a true loyalty and a true honesty then there's a artificial honesty an artificial loyalty see so he says we know that that is God God is the very Fountain and he's going to begin to describe this great fountain in the eternities brother Bram describes it in a number of places throughout his ministry I love this one excuse me I'll get i'll get this blowed out in a minute brother brandom talks about God this great fountain that was in eternity and he says to his audience here he says let's Close Our Eyes For a Moment close our eyes to our imaginations for a few moments and go way back into before there was anything that's pretty far amen the great Fountain of all eternity was that Spirit of love joy that Spirit of honesty that Spirit of tress in this Perfection and then out of the existence of the father went the logos which was the son which was a theophany which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth in a Celestial body brother brandham talks about in other places he says I can see him that that little light beginning to form he says something that could be seen this is before Angels this is before anything it was in that form that he created everything so this is the first form God takes from that Eternal fountain that eternal spirit and he he he begins to take on a form and it was a a a theophany it veiled that Pillar of Fire that veiled the theophany of God and so he goes on here he says now he says which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth in a Celestial body that's the logos the words spoke out of them great Fountains of life and went forth I I was I was reading this and I was thinking to myself I could only accept this from a prophet I mean you know when you when you read Isaiah and Isaiah says I saw the Lord high and lifted up and his train filled the temple I would need it to be a prophet to to to get a hold of that some you know when Ezekiel begins to talk about what he saw I'm going to need it to be a prophet because a prophet is one that can go up into those High atmospheres and actually see things and come back and describe it to me in intricate detail so I'm glad in the last day that you know we had a prophet who didn't just say you know God and the lofty heavens and Christ uh spoke all things into existence no brother brandham being a prophet he goes all the way back before there's anything and he says he was that great Fountain and out down from him flowed love and harmony and peace and truthfulness and and and and honesty and integrity and all and peace that peace and joy that passes understanding you got your mind around it amen so he says the word went out of them great Fountains of life and went forth and there was the theophany which was God made into word then that theophany was made flesh in the person of Christ Jesus isn't that simple I it's it it astonishes me how that people who are schooled and scholarly uh find three separate persons in the godhead and it's all because they don't and even the Oneness don't have it right either either and it's all because they don't catch the concept of the word that God was unfolding himself expressing himself on and on and on and that's why you are a continuation of that same expression yes amen he started as a fountain eventually he got to you God amen amen amen so he says that great fountain that that which was God made into word then theophany was made flesh in the person of Christ Jesus and then all the fullness of the trinity dwelt in him both Father Son and Holy Spirit all in that and that's the very way we go Plumb back to the original beginning of God there we are born again not of Flesh born again not of blood but Born Again by the spirit amen and in that eternal spirit of love and honesty comes down to make its place in us hallelujah amen so this is more than just what the the world of Christendom understands as you know I made a decision for Jesus it is so much more than that amen you understand that that that that wondering s star that came out from God and fell into a a a sinful world through a Fallen condition in a sin birth and and the spirit of God went through the Earth until he found you and he brought you back un himself you were always his hallelujah amen amen and I'm glad because oh yeah if I would if it would have been left up to me to make the decision let's let's be honest with each other we always we don't always make the right decision and sometimes we feel like yeah I'm ready to I'm ready to die for Christ and then sometimes we can't even find ourselves simply overcoming sinful things amen and the day before we were ready to give our life for it and here now we're wondering w you know wow so I'm glad it's not based on me making a decision cuz my decisions sometimes are wrong and sometimes they fail and and and sometimes I don't keep all my promises come on all you holy people that's right that's what David was thinking on his ways brother Bram takes that there and David say I thought on my ways brother Ram said David started thinking about all the promises that he had made to God and he knew he hadn't kept them all amen and he said I started thinking on my ways I'm G to tell you something friends I I I come here to you tonight I spent all day thinking on my ways and and I want to be like David I I I realize I need to turn my feet toward him more that's what this sermon this this this fifth part tonight just so Happ happens that it's it's it's Grace it's Faith it's five it's amen hallelujah amen so he says now we're born again by the spirit so we go Plum back to the original beginning of God and in that eternal spirit of love and honesty comes down to make its place in us and then when we die from this life we go into the body which and he quotes the scripture if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have a a theophonic up from Earth again and made in a glorified state to live in his presence forever then oh thank God then all the perversion all the things that was in the perversion all goes out of existence flesh goes to its punishment hell opens up her mouth and swallows in all the evil and the perversion and God and his beloved Church his bride takes their stand for the eternities to roll on that's the great hope of the Christian church that's the great hope of me today is that the great hope that's in your heart tonight amen you know in our text and I I was saying some kind of touching on this last Sunday you'll notice in our text that Jesus had said in the 28th verse come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest and then he goes into the 29th verse take my yoke upon you and learn of me so now I want you to see that's progress that's another step come unto me I will give you rest amen but once once and the rest is the new birth I'm going to talk about that but once that that's happened once once you're born again as as brother Brandon would often say when you're born again of the spirit of God that's not the end of your journey you're just getting started see so first the Lord says come unto me and I will give you rest and we know that Paul proved by the Old Testament that the promise of rest was the new birth Earth and the Holy Ghost amen and he goes back and he says he says otherwise you know why when they enter into the promised land but yet Joshua speaks of another rest and so Paul is proving by the Old Testament that that there was a rest yet for the family of God even though Israel entered the promised land there was yet a rest still coming it was never just going to be a natural land it's a spiritual possession which will lead us back to a redeemed Earth and then you won't just have a little section of land the whole world the whole universe will be yours amen so the promise of rest that Jesus is speaking of here come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden I will give you rest so that is a promise of the new birth in the Holy Ghost that new birth which would be the very moment and I I want to be very careful not care F I want to be very exact I want to be carefully exact how I say this amen uh because there there's amazingly confusion on it but the very moment that you hear recognize and act upon the Living Word of your hour coming to the Lord in complete surrender and through repentance of all you are and all you have ever been then the promise of the Holy Ghost is yours and you enter into the rest eternally the Holy Ghost is not hard to get that's why brother Brandon would say God wants to give it to you more than you want to receive it the problem was that coming up out of the church ages and coming up from the isua Revival they mistakenly thought that they understood what the what the real baptism of the Holy Ghost was and so we we've had to we had to wave through all of that and the prophet had to come along and start separating it out and then the opening of the word comes and then brother Brandon would begin to go down the line and say because you believe the word and I read that to you remember we came to we came to it in in Thessalonians where Paul where Paul is showing that that you are the accepted people because you have believed my testimony amen but then we also know it's more than just mental or mental agreement to the truth it's more than just knowing the truth because you say well I I I believe that I believe that God is and the devil also believes that I believe Jesus is the son of God the devil also believes that I believe God sent a prophet the devil I promise you believes that amen he took a beating for 33 years he's well acquainted with a prophet walking the land people can say what they want but the devil knows who the prophet was amen you don't you don't get pounded that long uh and not know who's pounding you amen so we find that a lot of times it was well we got to have this sensation or this that and that's all fine those those kinds of things depending on how your makeup is and and how the Holy Spirit works in your life it's an individual Affair you understand but but the bottom line is that I have heard and I have recognized and how did I do do that because the Holy Spirit revealed it to me and how did I get the Revelation because I had a something inside me that could respond to the word and I heard and I recognized my day and its message and then I acted upon that word and what did I do I repented thoroughly I said I don't want my life I don't want anything about it I don't want to be me Lord I want to be like you hallelujah amen the Lord knew I meant it and he kept his promised to me and now it's it's it's it's unbreakable that's right it's an unbreakable seal the devil can't break it don't let him tell you he can he can't even you can't break it amen you have come out of Egypt and you've entered into the promised land you have as Jesus would say in St John 5:24 you have passed from Death to life you can never come into the Judgment or the condemnation amen but again this is just the beginning not the ending just as Israel had to conquer every enemy after they crossed into the promised land they still had to conquer every enemy they had to drive them out they had to possess their land and I'm here to tell you something friends we know that that all that God has for us uh in growth and maturity after our new birth we're not talking about growing into a new birth right we are not talking about that that's a misunderstanding of the new birth I'm not growing into a new birth I have repented I have heard recognized my day I have believed on the Son of God I have surrendered my whole heart and Life to him and I have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost but now comes the time where I'm going to begin to grow and I'm going to begin to mature and sometimes and really in every case that can need time to fully make your new birth your own Amen to fully make it my own your Pilgrim Journey down here is not summed up as you've heard me say many times it's your Pilgrim Journey here is not summed up in okay you come to an altar and the Lord says okay you're in uh see you in see you in heaven you're redeemed see you in heaven it's not it's not how it works the whole purpose is so that the the whole mystery of red Redemption is supposed to be Christ in you living out to the whole world see so you're redeemed it and and and and and if that's the end of it then then then where's your persevering where's your living by faith where's your overcoming and dying daily amen I'm here to tell you something friends we have to Die daily we have to overcome daily we have to press the battle amen how else do we get up into those High atmospheres I I I reminded you of that last Sunday how are we going to get up into those High atmospheres that brother Brandon spoke of where all things are possible and the power of the spoken word flows through you because God knows he can trust you it's why brother Brandon would say you're just getting started goodness brother Bram had already been a Christian for many years and done been around the world and when he he comes there with his hands laid behind his and and he's getting ready to have an experience of going into that sixth Dimension and that's the very thing they're saying to him you're just getting started yeah amen the principle is not hard to to see because in fact is the the the principal aim uh is seen all the way back in Genesis in the fellowship that God had on a daily basis with Adam and Eve yeah that's the Genesis pattern and God never changes his mind about his word this is where brother brandham said that third phase of he he had one goal and that was to to go to to be expressed but he does it in three phases first he's going to be expressed in all the prophets priests and Kings he's going to come and be expressed fully in Christ and then he's going to commit the sacrifice be be killed he's be buried he'll raise he'll Ascend and then he'll send his life back into the church and get preeminence over his body the bride but the but the whole thing was always going to be to restore the kingdom back to its rightly position you're on that road right now that's what's up that's what's happening that's why it's a battle that's why Satan hates you cuz he can't stop that amen he thought he stopped it in Genesis he's wrong right amen so that so the very principle is seen in the fellowship that God had with Adam and Eve in Genesis and in fact is it's the exact same principle that we see operating in the Millennium brother brandham comes to the exposition of the seven Church age of the church age book thoy in church age he's talking about the ministry of the Morning Star it's a promise for our day because the evening star and The Morning Star are the same star it shall be light in the evening time amen the path to Glory you shall surely find right see it'd be a day it'd be dismal you can't call it day or night but in the evening time it shall be light the evening time light is the Morning Star you understand it it shows that it's the that it's the coming of Christ back to his full word again but Christ oh my goodness friends Christ had decided to stop being alone back in the aons he's coming to claim a bride and bring her to himself amen yes so brother Brenham says it is the morning star that is visible when the light of the sun commences to shine when our son Jesus comes there will be no further need of Messengers he will bring us his message of cheer himself as he rules his kingdom and we live in his presence the light of the word will become brighter and brighter in our perfect day amen so it's not only not only is that Fellowship seen in Genesis in Adam and Eve but it's seen in Christ and his bride in the Millennium this is the very thing he's saying he will bring us the message of cheer himself as he rules his kingdom and we live in his presence amen we live in his presence so from Genesis to the Millennium you can see that this has always been the pattern this was always what the promise of the best would be so you're following him now amen to get from this broken world to a millennial world yeah but in the millennial World you'll still be following him from there you'll still be following him and his presence to get to a new heavens and a new Earth so while we're here there is a daily connection with the spirit of God that you need to have you need to get a hold of it and and you need to hang on to it every day every day we should be reaching for a higher handhold on this climb up Zion Hallelujah every day you should reach for a higher handhold and climb up higher you're climbing Des Zion amen it's Christ in you the hope of glory so the mind of Christ you know there there must be an appropriation that it the mind of Christ is not just a a cliche let this mind be in you what does that even mean if it's not assimilated if there if there's not an if it's not appropriated into our innermost being there that there is to be understand there is to be a fellowship in your Redemption yes amen but without our willingness you buckled in tight amen without our willingness and self-discipline not even Christ's giving can make it our own in full experience and enjoyment amen want to say it again unless there is an appropriation by you of this Fellowship that is to exist in Redemption brother Brandon preached Redemption by Fellowship I read that to you Sunday in the Redemption the whole purpose of the Redemption is to restore fellowship and if you don't take ownership of that and every day discipline yourself and have an old sassr willingness to to enter into that fellowship and press your way however you need to get there then then even Christ even though Christ gives it to you and offers it to you you'll never know its full reality amen you'll be born again your Gene will still have come to life you still will never come to the Judgment because you've passed from Death to life we're not talking about that now we're talking about acquisition of all the promises of God wow amen so this is why we see Jesus repeat his promise see uh it's because that and and and and that's why he calls it to rest twice twice he first calls you to a rest of the Holy Ghost come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden I will give you rest and then he goes on learn of me take my yoke upon you amen see learn of me my yoke is easy my burden is light and so so th this is this is that wondering star brother brandham talks about Sons and Daughters of God just wondering Stars I I don't want to go too far down this Trail I'll be there probably on Sunday but there there came a call and you heard an eagle scream and you responded to the word and brother brandham said oh wondering star come home what are you doing out there why are you hanging out in the world come home wondering star but even when that happens this child you know must have this deeper uh and very personal uh appropriated rest that is to abide in him that does abide in him and it's to be made use of it's to be put it's to be put in action it's that's why it's hearing recognizing and acting so you know he so now he says not only come unto me but he says take my yoke amen upon you and learn of me yield yourself to my training amen submit everything of your will to me let your whole life be one with me and this is why St John 15 is abide in me amen see this is why Matthew 11 and St John 15 intersect because Jesus is saying to his disciples without me you can do nothing if ye abide in me and I abide in you then you will ask what you will why is that true because you'll be operating the mind of Christ and it won't be you doing it you'll be living up in those High atmospheres and God can trust you and God can operate that through you and I see so you see the connection so we're yielding ourself and then he then you see when you yield yourself and you submit your will and you allow your whole life to become one with his then you are abiding in him he's abiding in you and then he adds not only uh will I give but ye shall find amen amen you shall find rest for your souls Hallelujah the rest he gave at the beginning of your journey becomes something that you have made it your very own and you know you if you think about abiding in Christ and abiding with him that that is to say Christ dwelling within your heart I mean just just let your mind for a moment think about and I thought about this I thought about this this point right here for weeks and I thought goodness what was the look at the stark contrast of of when the disciples had Jesus with them on the outside versus after the upper room and they had him on the inside amen when they had him on the outside my goodness they they wanted to call fire down from heaven on unbelievers when they only had Jesus on the on on on the outside uh you know they they they're they're within their Inner Circle they they they're you know they're they're they're trying to figure out and they're trying to argue over who's the greatest Among Us amen and Jesus had to rebuke them so you're acting like a bunch of Gentiles see Gentiles have a problem with that amen so don't be like a gentile say I am no you're a Christian see amen oh yeah when they had him on the outside they're trying to call fire down on unbelievers and and and the reason that I talk about this Inner Circle is because I don't want you to to just go in your mind to say yeah yeah that's just kind of the way we are toward other people no hold on he went he went deeper than out there he went right in this Inner Circle he went right into this church and and said you you guys are arguing over who's the greatest yeah amen cuz that's what happens to a family to a church to a marriage to anything when Christ is just an acquaintance on the outside someone you know about see that's different than knowing him amen see so so I mean my goodness they they they they they were jostling and and posturing for seating position the throne oh I want to sit on your left hand I want to sit on your right well my mama said she wants me to sit on the right and well my mama said she wants me to sit over here and Jesus has had to say none of y'all even know what you're talking about that's not even mine to give can you drink the cup that I'm going to drink oh yeah we can do it okay we'll see they all ran for the hills in the garden when he was being arrested Peter denied him openly at his trial and and lied and cursed that he didn't even know him am I was talking to brother Dale uh yesterday or day before brother Dale was telling me about a sermon he preached about took that and he said man can you believe that Peter is trying to say I don't even know him it's like Peter how what do you mean you don't know him how how you don't remember him I mean he he healed your mother just by putting his hand on her you saw him walk on water you he handed you bread and Loaves and you fed 5,000 people what do you mean you don't know him how do you don't know him but that's what happens you forget what the Lord means to you very easily when you only have him as an acquaintance on the outside Thomas disbelieved he was raised from the dead my goodness even when he heard eyewitnesses telling people he trusted and Jesus had even said he would do that and yet Thomas is doubting him see you see the difference versus after after that the Holy Ghost came in the upper room so friends it was never it wasn't about you know who who fished with him and who hunted with him or who knew the prophet or who didn't it's never been about that is do you know him the author of Life they said brother Bram you don't know your Bible he said but I know the author very well Hallelujah and that's I want to know him and the and the power of His that I may know him and the power of His Resurrection being in and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if that I might attain unto see even Elisha needed the god of Elijah to have any real Authority in the miraculous amen Elisha had followed Elijah but he couldn't open the water he didn't have that same ability you know what that's the same thing I mean every minister of the message of this hour that's his example because Elisha had to prove that in his ministry his ministry was the continuation of Elijah's Ministry and the proof of it was that it would also open the water because Jordan meant death so it so it's divid it's separating death and allowing people to cross over into new life if my Ministry couldn't bring people from spiritual death into the living light and the realities of the Holy Ghost then I could never call myself an ordained minister but the very fact that we can preach and we can see the Sinners come to Christ and get a real New Birth and and young people be filled with the Holy Ghost then we know we have the continuation of that Ministry amen and they said that when they saw Elijah Elisha do that he said the spirit of Elijah to thr on him Hallelujah say well I I I've I've got the spirit of William brandham on me because the spirit of Elijah brother brandom said the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ amen just use as human vessels right see so there's a lot to be said about about obedience because that's the real secret of power in fact is I in my Bible Spurgeon wrote here I've got it it's a copy of his own hand where he wrote it he said we not only know rest from the guilt of sin this he gives us but we shall rest in the Peace of Holiness which we find through obedience to him so there is a peace that comes in Holiness that you are in obedience to him I'm glad he saved me I'm glad he I'm born again I'm glad I had a gene of God I'm glad for this message but I want a rest I want the kind of peace that only comes from obedience and Holiness Hallelujah friends oh break free from this world you're you're not here for that that's not why that's not why you were redeemed you were redeemed to know him in the power of his resurrection amen it's interesting because a lot of times people when you when you get on obedience as if I wasn't already making it a little uncomfortable now we're going to turn it up even another notch oh wow now we're going to get down to obedience can I just say to you that it occurred to me as I was thinking about this some some days ago that it was only after the fall that obedience became a a collection of laborous works for man to do after the fall Works become something actually after the fall Works become something that can determine someone's Destiny and works become a a laborous thing but that was only after the fall because before the fall obedience was in love see um Z is that you honey give me uh give me um revelation chapter 20 uh Revelation 20 let's start uh at a at verse 11 all right and I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works now thank God the bride is not standing at this judgment because she's already been redeemed in Christ and he was already judged for her see so he he brother brandham said God judged him as a sinner he who knew no sin he who never committed a sin say well then how' he get judged as a sinner because he took your sin yes amen he had never committed a sin he he knew no sin but the Bible says he became sin and and brother Bram says and God judged him as a sinner and sent him to hell and I'm I I tell you something friends that gives me no joy to say but what does give me joy is he went so I don't ever have to go Hallelujah and he rose and ascended up on high and now I have his life living in me and I passed from Death to life I can never come to the judgment am but the world now are being judged according to their Works see if if because if they're just works you know listen I if if it's just works without out an experience then that's judged as iniquity in Matthew 25 cuz that's what those try to claim hey we did all these things in your name and Jesus said your hearts are full of iniquity I never even knew you see so works for the sake of works and that that's why the whole world has missed that whole point the whole thing is not about works works are never supposed to be a labor it's it's works of love it's labors of Love am see when we take the Bible as a whole all the obedience that we see in chapter and verse from Genesis to Revelation was always to be an expression of deep love Psalms chapter 1 Z probably one of the most familiar Psalms too the whole world other than maybe the 23rd psalm Psalms chapter 1 veres 1 and two blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful catch it verse two but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law does he meditate day and night that doesn't sound like somebody being forced into something that doesn't sound like somebody grinding over the law this is somebody who loves God's law and God's word is a delight to their heart see David's whole anguish was when he failed to keep that law this is why I don't know if you have it Zoe the NLT version back there I'm just going to read it if you got it you can catch up to me Psalms 1 veres 1 to3 from the NLT listen to this all the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked are stand around with Sinners or join in with mockers but they Delight in the law of the Lord meditating on it day and night they are like trees planted along the riverbank bearing fruit each each season their leaves never wither and they prosper in all that they do amen see just as I have a desire to perform the works that I perform as a a husband or to take care of a wife and to provide for children and a family and and and and and and you know as as a husband to be to be faithful to be helpful to be caring as I live a a life of service for my wife you think that's a that's a labor there's lots of labor involved in it but it's a joy amen what what father you know goes to work and goes to the grocery store and and says oh my goodness all my heart earned money I got to spend to feed all of these kids there are wretched men in the world who do that and walk out on their family but that's not a real man a real man who loves his wife and loves his home and loves his children loves his family loves his grandchildren he'll go to the end of the world they can take everything he's got and he'll love it and smile I said grandchildren preacher should speak the truth I'm glad I have honest grandchildren they'd take me to the cleaners this is the kind of obedience that actually gives you access to the tree of life amen that was what was happening in the garden see it it it it was the in fact is it was The Obedience was the one requirement for living in the garden obedience was the one requirement for abiding in the garden as soon as they stopped obeying they had to leave amen you understand so obedience brings forth Holiness but it's not laborous it's not a hardship Jesus said take my yoke upon upon you my burden my yoke is is easy my burden is light amen see so it's a labor of love we find that that that where does it come from it comes from a fountain that Springs up within you that's the fountain that I read to you in the beginning that you have been connected back to that Eternal Fountain Hallelujah and God was that great fountain in the eternities this is why John says Jesus said in John 4:10 Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou would have asked of him and he would have given thee Living Water John 7:37 to39 in the in the in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water amen see but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost is not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified so as far you know as as serving God you know as far as serving God by by disconnected works I mean I I don't want to stand on that day then trying to stand on works why would I do it now I don't want to try that then why would I try it now don't you're not going to want to try it then don't try it now it's not about that kind of works come back to the Fountain and be reconnected come into Christ and cease from your Works he says and I will give you rest for soul this is exactly why truth and blessing that comes from Christ is fully realized and is only fully realized by your willingness to abide in Christ amen amen I'm not saying that you know I mean if you're born again of the spirit of God I'm not saying that that you can't uh to some degree realize the blessings of God the L because hey look the Lord's not going to be defeated you've already passed from Death to life he said I will not lose one of them so blessed be the name of the Lord this isn't about losing your Eternal destination this isn't about getting born again and then getting unborn again there's no such a thing of that in the Bible we're not talking about that we're talking about coming and taking a yoke upon you and learning of him and being trained by him and have a willingness to grow in Christ amen there is so much value in abiding in Christ to maximize every potential that God has for you and I both in this world and in the world to come do you understand fre friends this is why I said to you I think in and it must have been part one or two I think I've said it several times that the spirit of the Lord knows that the saving of your soul is more than just making a mental decision amen because he knows it's more than that so he comes for your heart it's it's about experiencing God's very life entering our hearts brother Brandon would call it two omnipotence meeting amen speaking of a gene of God they they unite and they stay United forever in in that perfect Oneness I got a few minutes left you good amen so we ask you and we've asked several times see and now I hope I I think probably that you're you're grasping why that Jesus would deepen the invitation from just come unto me to abide in me and I think you're coming to grasp why he refers to twice introspection is a a thing that can sometimes make a person very uncomfortable but introspection is what you do every time you come into the house of God and the Bible Paul described it like a mirror and it shows you why it's a house of judgment I I've had people say to me you know I would come to church but it's it's just not a it's just not a I don't feel good when I come I said why not well you know sometimes the preaching gets gets really straight and hard and it's uncomfortable and I said what do you think church is it's a house of judgment judgment begins at the house of God I'm trying to save your life amen amen what you suggest I do Pat you on the back and tell you everything will be fine and God will understand you see Jesus and I I'm not going to go much further than this I just want to make this point I'm going to set myself up for Sunday you remember when Jesus comes and he says to his disciples the field is white and harvest and I'm going to saving the time to turn make you turn and read it you'll remember it the field is white and harvest pray ye the Lord of the Harvest that he sent forth laborers into his Vineyard the very next chapter and at first when I thought about this I thought seems backwards I wonder why he did it that way and then it occurred to me because a chapter later they come to him and say Lord teach us how to pray John taught his disciples how to pray teach us how to pray and I I thought you know the first time he ever asked them to pray the first time in all four gospels that he ever asked them to pray was when he said the field is white and the Harvest pray ye the lord lord of the Harvest that he send forth labors and brother Bram said he himself was the lord of the Harvest and what he was saying to them brother R said what he was saying to his disciples is I want to do this but I want you to pray and ask me to do it why because I want your involvement I want your fellowship I want I I I the whole the whole world was created for you and me the whole thing is a kingdom the whole thing is a family I'm not Santa Claus I'm I'm the master of the whole universe and you're my family amen so now you can imag then it made sense to me I thought yeah now now the disciples are starting to catch on this guy is asking us to pray for something then I'm going to I'm going to probably I better start looking inward to make sure I can pull this off Lord you better teach me how to pray you've asked me to pray but I need you to teach me how and you've even told me what to pray for I need you to teach me how to go about that and the very first thing that he teaches them is when you pray first acknowledge God our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name give me my kingdom come and do all of my will will be done not if you're going to pray to the Lord of the Harvest you're not going to pray like that not if you're going to accept the challenge pray ye the lord of the Harvest that he send forth laborers I'm here to tell you something friends we got a lot of things going on in our lives that we need the lord of the Harvest we got children lost we got loved ones out there we got people with sickness we got young people that still need the Holy Ghost we need contact with the lord of the Harvest I need to have an the first first thing he did was say you need to turn inward and put you aside and say Lord you oh Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done amen amen in this earth make this image look like the one that's up there make this image look like the one that doth always behold his father's face help me to come into the image that you saw of me before the foundation of the world help me you know you know forgive me all my sins and as I forgive those who sin against me see introspection gets oo but you've been asked you've been asked come Anthony bring your team you've been asked to join the lord of the Harvest to get the job done stand to your feet feet you've been invited friends you've been invited to join to team up with the lord of the Harvest to get it done amen he didn't even say I need y'all to go do it he said I just need you to pray and ask me to do it you see friends can you can you begin to put your minds around why again I say it again again and again you can see why that Jesus surely after this fifth installment you really are catching it you're coming into the vision the Lord put on my heart at the end of last year he deepens the invitation amen it's not just come unto me it was never going to be just come unto me it was always going to go to abide in me you come and I'll give you rest for your souls but then you need to learn of me then you need to let me train you you need to let me mold you you need to you need to be introspective when you're reading my word when you're praying you need this Genesis relationship restored back you can't make this on your own you can't figure it all out you're going to need a guide brother brandham found that out he said I found out I needed a guide oh this weary world we can get so lost in it friends but I'm glad we have a guide I'm glad we've got someone faithful who not only has told us what we need but told us how to get it and told us all you have to do is get going in that way and and I'll come down and we'll meet and I'll bring you in and I'll draw you into myself but I won't Force you but if you want real power if you really want Authority if you really want to live in those upper atmospheres you have to be willing to do that friends if you really want to consummate your marriage with Christ that's what it's all about so that your works are works of Love they're Works based on an experience they're not works absent an experience we have never from the first day I ever became pastor of bethl Tabernacle we have never went in that direction we have never tried to browbeat the people into a bunch of works I've tried to draw you the way I came falling in love with Jesus Falling in Love with his word saying lord I can't do it but you can you I can do all things through you if you'll help me Lord and if you'll Lift Me Up Above these Shadows I I want to I'm going to be like David how many tonight say I'm going to be like David I'm gonna I've thought on my ways tonight I'm
