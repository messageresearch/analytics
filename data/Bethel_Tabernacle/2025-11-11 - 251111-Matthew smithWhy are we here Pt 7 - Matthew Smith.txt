Good to be here in the house of the Lord. Sorry, we were having some heat issues. Didn't have no heat and the internet didn't work. So, we were doing everything we could to troubleshoot.

Let's all stand back [music] to our feet. Amen. We didn't have any specials tonight, so we're just uh going to keep singing, but we want to just take up the tithes and offerings tonight. Do you love the Lord Jesus? Amen. We won't do this at this time, but any unspoken request, we'll take now. You just have a need you just want to lift up. Hold that hand up before the Lord. Maybe something upon your heart you want the Lord to just remember. Brother Luther, come and take up these things. God bless you. He's actually sweating. &gt;&gt; Sister Melissa is not feeling well this evening. She was having the room was spinning and had a headache [music] all day, sore throat. So, we want to remember her this evening. Um, she was napping when on the couch when I got home and she's usually not doing that. [music] So, we just want to remember her this evening also. Father, we just want to thank you for a place that we can come and set [music] aside, Father, to a sanctuary for you to come and meet with us and us [music] to just set aside things of this world. Present ourselves to you this evening, [music] Father, that we could worship you in spirit and in truth and you would be pleased and you would speak to our hearts and strengthen us this evening, Lord, for the minister breaking the bread of life to us. I pray for him. I pray that you help him. I am expecting and looking for good things, Father. And Lord, as we collect the tithes and offerings, I pray that you have blessed the cheerful giver. We thank you for the bounty that you give us, Lord. There are so many people in this world that are going without tonight. But Father, we're not going without because you've blessed us and you've watched over us. So I just pray for [music] the service, the remaining part, the word that gets broken. Remember sister Melissa this evening, Father, and those requests upon the hearts, Father. Lord, we know that you can move and as the song said, we know that you're here when we call. We thank you for that, Father. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. We have brother Matthew Matthew Smith going to be preaching for us tonight.

I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk this [music] pilgrim way for need the words. I need to know them. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, the secret all is this that the comforter abides. There it is. Oh, he abides. Oh, he abides. He abides. [music] Halleluah. He abides with me. I'm rejoicing [music] night and day as I walk this pilgrim way. For the [music] comforter abides with me. There's [music] no searching for the things of [singing] the world. They've taken wings. Long ago I gave them up [music] and [singing] instantly all my [music] night was turned to day. All my burdens rolled away. For the [music] comforter abides with me. Oh, he abides. He [music] abides. Yes, he does. [music] Halleluah. He abides with me.

For the comforter [music] abides. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; might [music] [music] give me that first verse. Once once my heart was full [music] of sin. Once I had no peace within till [music] I heard how Jesus died upon the tree. Then I fell [music] down at his feet and there came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter abides. Sing it church. Oh, [music] he abides. [music] He abides. Hallelujah. Hallelu. [music] He abides with me. I'm rejoicing night [music] and day as I walk the narrow way for the comforter abides with me. Give the Lord a hand clap of praise. [music] He's worthy. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. We're going to turn our hearts now to the word. Are you hungry? Did you come with a hunger in your heart to hear from the Lord? We want our brother Matthew to um just take his liberty. Want to sing that song, Sister Deb? He is our peace that has broken down every wall. [clears throat] Want our brother to take his liberty? You know, Brother Brandham said that we, you operate the gift that God puts in a man's life. How many knows that the prophet taught us that? And so what you get out of the service won't be the fault of the preacher. It also won't be to the credit of the preacher if you get something out of it. It'll be all to the glory of God. How many want to say, "Lord, I want to do my part to pull on the gift of God." Just take brother Matthew right out of his notes. Uh you know, if you need to do if he the Lord needs to do that, he can just come and speak to your heart. [music] Amen. tonight. He is our peace that has broken down every [singing] wall. He is our peace. [music] He is our peace. He is He is our peace. Sing that again now. He is our peace [music] that has broken down every wall. [singing] He is our peace. He [music] is our peace. He is He is Okay, let's sing this [music] with our hands raised. Cast all your cares. So cast [music] all your cares on him for he cares [music] for you. [music] He is our peace. He is our peace. can all your cares on [music] him for he car for you. He [music] is our peace. He is our peace. Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord this evening. Um, want to maybe turn directly to the Lord in prayer this evening before we read our text. You know, brother Brandham said that we don't have a right to go to the word until we go to the author of the word first. that we can read some text, we can read the word, but without the Lord to provide a divine inspiration and provide a context for what it is that we read, we'd honestly end up in a worse state than where we started. So, we want to turn our hearts to the Lord in prayer. Father, we come before you humbly this evening, Lord. That Father, I would never even dare to stand up here behind this holy desk with some if I thought that it was just something that I'd come up with, some some conjuration of my mind, Lord, that I' I'd crafted or invented, Father. Lord, I would only ever dare to say something if I knew that it was you, Father, that was bringing inspiration that it was your word that I was holding to that I was holding up a standard of your word. That Father, you can speak to the people, speak, edify their hearts, edify their souls. that Lord in this dark and dreadful day with the enemy all around that Father we'd [music] have to cling to your hand to your unchanging and steadfast hand and to your word that cannot change Father for you cannot lie that when you speak Father that it is assurityity that though heavens and earth pass away Father that your word will never fail. So we turn to the word, Father, this evening and ask that you would give us give you would provide the interpretation that Father, you interpret your own word. Father, that you would be pleased to move amongst us this evening and that I could step out of the way that Father I'd have some sort of emotion or feeling or or nerves or whatever it may be that Father that I could step aside. I could get out of the way that Lord you would you would take over. That Father you would speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, I'm not a preacher. I never was, never claimed to be. But, Father, you can preach. So, Father, I just want to be a microphone. I just want to be a an an empty vessel, Lord, for [music] your spirit to move through. That Father, your people can pull. Truly, Lord, it is the people who operate that gift. And I am nothing. So, Father, we ask that you would be mindful of your people this evening. be with us in Jesus precious and allsufficient name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. I want to turn this evening for a text and um I apologize if you guys end up hearing some repeats from my Sunday school that I am going to repeat some of it. Um, and uh, for those of you who aren't gonna hear this as a repeat, why aren't you at Sunday school? Um, so you'll so you you all get it one way or the other. Um, so we want to turn to St. John chapter 1 and verse one. Um, I'm sure this is a very very familiar scripture to everybody. Um, in fact, most of what I'm going to say most if not all of what I want to say tonight, what I have in my notes is not particularly it's not a big deep mystery. It's not anything crazy. You're not going to have your minds blown more than likely. Um but um you know when you get a hold of of the concepts of the word you realize just how all-encompassing they are and you can when the Lord does has a simple foundational concept you'll be able to see it run through the entire Bible and everything all of nature all the Bible all of it will will be uh reflecting that. So I want to turn John chapter St. John chapter 1 and verse one. In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. The Lord have added the blessing to the word. You all can be seated. I'm sure we're done with the instruments. We thank the Lord for our musicians. &gt;&gt; Um, did you guys in the sound booth, I know I sent y'all that WhatsApp very late. Did you all get that video? I don't know if you can pull it from the WhatsApp. If you will send me the sound booth email, I can try to email it to you. Do you got it? No. But you have the link. Sorry. I'm I I'm I'm failing my sound booth crew. I've uh committed cardinal sins um and not and not uh not given them enough heads up. Um I think I also probably missed a title as well. Um so my my title my title uh for this evening is um I don't know what part it would be anymore. Um but I title my Sunday school the kind of series I've been doing is why are we here? And I guess um we can just make this the next part. I guess it's part eight, I think. Um, and for though, like I said, for those of you who haven't heard the Sunday school, um, the where I got that title is, you know, we we noticed that, you know, we obviously we're all here both on the earth, but in sort of like maybe some grand cosmic sense of like why are we here? Why are why is humanity on the earth? What's the point of all this? But also, why are we these people in this building right now? Um, and really if you get into it and really understand the answer to that question, you realize that um, the answer is the same for both of those questions. Why we are on the earth and why we are in this building is kind of the same answer. Um, and it's that God wanted a family, right? God, the the creator of heavens of earth, um, was alone before creation and he needed to express himself. He needed he had all these things inside of him that needed to come out. And so he expressed himself in the form of a family. And you know, brother Brandham and for the sake of not rehashing, you know, seven, eight parts of a Sunday school, um I will make some references and not uh on some of this stuff and not necessarily give you citations, but I've read it all in my Sunday schools. Um if you don't believe me um we have recordings but you know brother Brandham said and when I um at in I believe was Christ the mystery of God revealed he said that the the point the purpose of the of the entire Bible was the expression was a three-fold purpose for the entire Bible and it all boils down to God having a family that God having a bride and a and children and that he could be made full like he have a fullness in his family. It's why he has a made a garden of Eden and put his children in it that he could be a father and that he could come down in the cool of evening and have unity with his family. And so because of that, because if that's the whole point of the Bible, right, that that that family and the uni and the united family is the whole point of the Bible, it's really really behooves us to pay very close attention to how we organize our families, the structure of our families, how we conduct ourselves within the family, how husbands treat their wives, how wives treat their husbands, how parents treat children, and how children treat parents. These are all core fundamental concepts that are not a side note to the message. &gt;&gt; They are kind of the whole message, &gt;&gt; right? They're right through the middle of the whole thing. You can't separate one from the other, right? Um, okay. Yeah, that looks like the video. Um, you all can hang off and I'll give you a thumbs up when we're ready for that. Thank you. Um, so anyways, um, I want to there's three concepts that I'm going to deal with tonight. Um, Lord willing. And it's I'm not really necessarily I'll make reference to these and I I'm going to say it off on the three bullet points right on the front end so that y'all can have them in your mind. So as I go through my material, you can refer back to them in your mind and you'll kind of have these concepts. Uh, these are my my themes that are going to be kind of recurring hopefully. The first is that the natural types the spiritual which is the same as saying the spiritual determines the natural. The hand determines the shape of the shadow. Right? If I hold my hand up to the light, it casts a shadow. My hand determines the shape of the shadow. The shadow does not determine the shape of my hand. Right? The natural is a shadow of what's the natural world. Everything you see around you, your life and lifestyle and the world that you live in is a shadow of what's going on in a spiritual realm. Okay? and and what's going on in the spiritual realm is absolutely determining what we are is around us. Now the second is the purpose of the entire Bible and the plan of redemption is for God to have a united family. Therefore the family and the family structure is not coincidental to the plan of redemption. It is the core of it. Okay. Thirdly, the spoken word is the original seed and the serpent's seed is the devil's alternative. The two are always found close together. Okay. The devil's alternative, the devil is trying to poison you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. The devil is not go he's he's trying to to give you his toxic alternative. Now, he's always going to be close, very, very close to God's provided way, right? He's always going to be very close to that. Listen, if you're an assassin and you're trying to poison someone, you're not going to try to hide the cyanide in a, you know, rotten Snickers bar that's been run over in the street. &gt;&gt; No one's That's not tempting to anybody, right? No one's going to go for that. You go No, you put it in a in a steak dinner, right? You you make the delicious steak dinner and it's got the the the grilled vegetables and the mashed potatoes and the steak and and you know and it's and it's all put together and it smells so delicious and it's very nourishing and it's part of a well- balanced diet and there's all the vitamins and the vegetables and the minerals and the and the fats and the proteins and it's a well- balanced diet and it's very nourishing to the body. will kill you dead to doornail, &gt;&gt; right? Because there's no matter how good it may be, that tiny 1%. You haven't realized how small of amount of cyanide it takes to kill someone, it's a very, very small amount. Okay? We're talking like less than 1% of the volume of the dinner is poison and it will kill you. Okay? Satan's alternative is going to smell delicious. It's going to look delicious. It's going to feed parts of your of your spirit. It's going to feed a hunger that you might not even know you had, &gt;&gt; right? It's going to sound just like the real deal. And it will kill you. &gt;&gt; Okay. So I want to, you know, move on here and and and just uh notice that um referring back to my text in the beginning uh was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. Now this is the text that brother Ram took for spoken word's original seed. Um and that word right the word word means it's a Greek word actually that would translate to the Greek as logos. We are all familiar with this, I hope. Um, and the logos, right? It it in in if you were back in the day and you were familiar with the Greeks and you were back when this was, you know, pinned and you understood the Greek, you recognize that the that the word logos refers to what the Greeks refer to as the divine word of creation, right? That when you speak the logos, it makes reality come into being. &gt;&gt; Okay? So that's why brother Brandham took that that brother Brandham caught that and said wait a minute when it says logos here it's refer like that's why John's using that Greek word right it's referring to something that the Greeks would under a concept the Greeks would have understood that when God speaks he speaks with logos speaks with a divine word of creation incidentally this is why God cannot lie right we know that God you know would swear by himself why because God cannot lie why cannot can God not lie Right. It's not because you know if or you know and I I not I feel like you know I've always heard this scripture growing up as a kid and I always thought was like you know you know God would have um you know some some if you took some object right like the label on this bottle is white and God would be unable to say it was any other color right it's not that God can't say some fact that he knows is not factually accurate. That's I don't think that's what that scripture means necessarily, right? I don't think it is true that God can say something factually inaccurate. I don't think God can lie in that sense either. But I think the deeper meaning there is that when because God speaks with creative power, if God said this label is black, &gt;&gt; it'll be black, &gt;&gt; right? He can't lie because when he says it, it happens. &gt;&gt; No matter what the situation is, &gt;&gt; reality just conforms to what he says. He couldn't lie if he wanted to, &gt;&gt; right? He just it just happens. So, you know, the this So, when God's Oh, thank you, brother. I have a water, but I appreciate it. Um or is that that one's for you? Um I guess he gets thirsty, too. Um, so, uh, anyhow, so when God speaks, it's notable that brother Brandon would type that spoken word as a seed. If you know what a seed is, a seed is a little mechanism, right? There's inside of that little package. It's a little little envelope that has DNA inside of it. DNA is literally written instructions on how to build whatever it is that that seed is going to make, right? Whatever life form is going to come out of that seed, there is written instructions on how to do it in the form of DNA. It's actually genuinely probably the absolute best um actual evidence of an intelligent creator because how in the world does a written language just spontaneously become out of nothing? It doesn't happen. It is it is it is the spoken word in physical condensated form. Right? It is intelligence written in reality &gt;&gt; and inside. So that little genetic package &gt;&gt; and it's got some little mechanisms in there so that when those little mechanisms detect that this seed has come into the correct environment that the life form can come forth it just activates. It starts opening that little word the little seed up all the instructions and then it just becomes and unfolds and it becomes a life. Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I could get that video up now, please. Um, now in humans, right, we have right there's a male side and a female side and those two things come together. Just hold because it's very short and and I want to give some preamble first. So the um when the when the the the we all all know there's you know many many male seed and there's one female seed and they're all you know traditionally we've all kind of been taught that it's a it's a race, right? Right? It's just whichever one gets there first. &gt;&gt; It's not exactly accurate. Um it's more accurate to say that the female chooses the male one and then releases chemicals that repel all the wrong ones. &gt;&gt; Right? That's how that works. And it's actually because there's and it's based off of genetic compatibility that the DNA the genetics inside the deep there's something deep down inside that little female that recognizes something inside that. There's a deep calling to a deep here. There's something genetic over there and something genetic over here. There's a seed here and a seed there. And those two things have to be compatible. And if this one doesn't agree with this one, well, it's not going to be accepted. And it's not right. And so, and so they're never going to connect and they're never going to make life. &gt;&gt; And so that se so the female it it accepts the male and it allows them to come in contact. When it does, when that male comes in contact with the female, the the the on the cellular level, the female hardens, it calcifies. It hardens and it seals itself. Right? This is why &gt;&gt; this is the type, the natural typing is spiritual. &gt;&gt; When you receive the new birth and your heartens to the devil, &gt;&gt; right? It seals you into the day of your redemption, &gt;&gt; right? You're you you received a seed from God and now there's life coming forth and it and it it locks out any all because listen there's 40,000 different compet competitors for the true seed of God, &gt;&gt; right? There's 40,000 different options, but only the true predestinated one is going to react to a true predestinated &gt;&gt; the true predestinated bride. And so and when you come in contact with that, it you it hardens and it seals it out. Now the other thing that happens, brother Brandham says this over and over and over again in the message talks about when light strikes the seed or or the seed comes together and then the light a light flashes over it. He says this in like the 50s and 60s. This is a this is a video and I think I've played this before some years ago. I think maybe brother Jason has played something similar like this very I think in the 90s they actually got video of it. This is, if you go ahead and play the video, this is from obviously 2016. &gt;&gt; That's video. That's a literal visible to the eyeball light that flashes. It It's It's a reaction with a with zinc and it makes a flash that's actually slowed down so you can see it. If it's run in real time, it's like as fast as a flash bulb on a camera. It pops like it's fireworks, &gt;&gt; okay? God celebrates every baby with fireworks, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It and it's it it's like, you know, and so, huh, man, oh, if there's anybody anybody on this earth who thinks that God doesn't care about you, let me tell you, God celebrates every single person with fireworks. I don't care how wretched and miserable you think your life has become and what kind of train wreck you've made that has become of your life. God doesn't think you're a train wreck. God thinks you're worth more than 10,000 worlds. God thinks you're so valuable that the most valuable thing he could think of would be his own blood. And yet that's worth less than you because he paid it for you. You don't listen. If I go to the grocery store and get a a gallon of milk and I hand the, you know, seems like it's like $12 now. Um, if I give the cashier some money, what's worth more to me, the money or the milk? Well, I was willing to part with the milk with the money, &gt;&gt; right? Well, if God's willing to part with his own blood, what's worth more to him? &gt;&gt; What's worth more, the you or the blood? Well, obviously, it's the one that he chose. It's the one that he that he that he refused to part with. &gt;&gt; And so when this when this moment of conception happens and this hardening of the heart happens, you know, this is also, you know, again, it goes both ways because if if you accept Satan's alternative, &gt;&gt; the serpent seed, there's 40,000 alternatives. There's there's the devil's gonna have a a million one ways to distract you from the real deal. And if the you know when the Bible talks about brother Jason made this comment the other day and it man it so struck me. You know the Bible talks about God hardening Pharaoh's heart but don't forget that Pharaoh hardened his own heart first &gt;&gt; right? He Pharaoh hardened his own heart first. Why? Because there was something inside of Pharaoh that rec the deep inside of Pharaoh recognized it deep inside of the devil. &gt;&gt; There was a genetic compatibility there. &gt;&gt; And he accepted the false seed. He accepted Satan's lie and it hardened his heart. &gt;&gt; He accepted it and it locked out Moses's message to him. &gt;&gt; And that's what happens. He was he there was something, you know, listen. That's why brother Brandham said people wondering is you know if have I you know gone across the line and he brother Brandham said if there's a desire in your heart there's still a chance &gt;&gt; right there's this desire in your heart to seek after the Lord that's that's that genetic compatibility still reaching for the word &gt;&gt; there's always a chance if there's a desire in your heart you hang on to that and you you you listen to it and you don't just disregard that. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's the Lord calling you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, you know, we at the end of the day, all of this comes down to, you know, this is just a very natural type, but it's but it's typing the spiritual side of this, right? That it's the it's not about, you know, little as beautiful as the miracle of life is, but it's about people and what we do and and how we we live our lives. And you know, you you look at at Adam in the garden, you know, where where your heart is, right? That that longing in your heart, that genetic compatibility in your heart is going to is going to determine what you do, right? The spiritual is going to determine the natural. Your your body, your life, and your lifestyle is going to follow what's going on on the inside. And you know, when you look at Adam in the garden and and he sins and God is calling Adam, Adam, where are you? He he Adam or God is not asking Adam what bush he's hiding behind. &gt;&gt; God knows what where you're hiding, &gt;&gt; right? God's not ignorant of where you're at. You know, when you're when you're just some sinner and you're lost and you feel like you your life is in shambles, God knows right where you're at, &gt;&gt; right? You hear the hear the Lord calling, "Hey son, hey daughter, where are you?" He know Yeah. He knows where you're at. It's not a He knows what's going on in your life. &gt;&gt; He's asking you, "Hey, where's your heart?" That's what happened. Adam's heart left the garden. Adam hadn't left, but his heart did. That's why God is looking because he's looking going around the garden. Adam, your heart's not anywhere in here. I could go all over the garden and Adam's heart is anywhere anywhere in the in the garden. So that's what he's asking because God knew that the natural is going to follow the spiritual because Adam's heart left. Adam was going to leave. &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it, right? And if your wherever your heart is, whatever has hold of your heart is what's going to have hold of you. &gt;&gt; No matter what kind of like how hard you strain and give yourself a hernia trying to do something different, whatever has your heart is going to have you, &gt;&gt; right? You're going to be you're going to be bound to it. So, you know, the same thing happened with Lot's wife. Lot's wife left Sodom, but Sodom never left her, right? She got out of she got out of Sodom and and what? She couldn't She just couldn't bear to leave it. Had to look over her shoulder, right? Because there was something back there calling for her heart. And you know, and so she never left. She didn't leave the destruction. And so, and you know, I I I really appreciate it and I'll and I'll, you know, Brother Matt um made this statement recently about children of Israel leaving Egypt and how so many people left Egypt and they, you know, and and you know, this is a beautiful type. There's a work of justification. There's a work of sanctification under the law. And then there's a the new birth and going into the promised land, right? Where the brand uses this type a lot. And so many people, many many many people will leave Egypt, right? They'll leave Egypt and they're happy that the Lord saved them from slavery and bondage under whatever addiction that they were fighting or they you know have some whatever shambles that their life was and the Lord saves them from that and you know then they go into some work of sanctification and and that's you know the and that's the law right you know Moses children of Israel received the law and that kind of gives them some instructions on how to live right and so they do some sanctifica you know and they just kind of mill around in these varying degrees of sanctification for 40 And they never really give God their heart, &gt;&gt; right? Because, you know, they left Egypt, but Egypt never left them. They were always wondering what could have been if they would have just hung on to the the onions and garlics and, you know, was Pharaoh that bad really, you know, and it's and you know, me, you know, people Christians do this. They'll they'll they recognize that where they're at with with with Pharaoh is so miserable. They have some addiction in their life. They have some miserable calamity in their life. They have, you know, everyone's so many people will leave the message right up until their dad gets cancer and now suddenly they know who to call, right? And it's not a, you know, that's look, the Lord knows how to get rid, you know, get a hold of you. You know, the Lord knows how to set your barns on fire. Don't don't get me wrong. And that can be good, but you know, it's people so many times people don't want the Lord until they really need the Lord, &gt;&gt; right? And then and so the Lord will deliver them from, you know, and then and they the problem is they're really not sad that they sinned. They're not sad that they were in Egypt. They're just sort of sad of the consequences. They just wish Pharaoh wasn't such a jerk, right? They really liked living in Egypt, actually. They really liked the lifestyle they had there. It's just, man, Pharaoh was so mean, you know, and it's, you know, I really like the I really like my lifestyle, but man, the hangover on Monday is rough, right? I really like my lifestyle, but you know, uh, you know what? You know, you know, it's breaking you down. And so, you you leave, you you get justified. you, you know, you kind of come to church and you clean yourself up and you get some you get some law. You get a list of dos and don'ts from the church, right? You get a law. You get a law that says, "Thou shalt not smoke and thou shalt not drink and thou shalt not watch pornography. Thou shalt not cuss and thou shalt not cut your hair and wear pants if you're a lady." And we all and you know this is it's a list of dos and don'ts and it's a lot of thou shalt nots and thou shalts and you know you can sit there and you can mill around in that for 40 years and you will have never left Egypt actually because Egypt never left your heart. You're always just looking over your shoulder going, "Man, I just I liked my lifestyle. I just wish the hangover wasn't so rough." &gt;&gt; Right? And you know that's legalism. It's it's dos and don'ts. It's it's just the problem, you know, because the problem with legalism is that it's it's actually, you know, we have this idea that it's hyperrestrictive, right? Like it's it's you know, thou do you wicked person, thou shalt not, and I'm going to be all up in all of your business and and every little aspect of your life is going to be controlled and and and a lot of times it does turn into that, right? You can get like very legalistic type people who every little thing, every every time your shoes are untied, it's a condemnation. And you know, um [sighs and gasps] the reality is um Pharisees are lawyers. Lawyers know how to break the law. Okay? Or rather, lawyers know how to manipulate the law. Right? &gt;&gt; And so what happens is, you know, Pharisees, Pharisees are like the champion of legalism, right? No, you know, you think of a real legalist, you think of a Pharisee. And so Pharisees are the kind of people who are like, you know, on on Sabbath. And I and I did some research on this because it blew my mind when I heard this. You know, the Pharisees are the kind of people who are like, you know, on the Sabbath, you know, you shall do no work on the Sabbath day. And that includes I listened to a rabbi this today actually do some talking about this and the rabbi said that biblically they're allow so hang on let me back up. So on the Sabbath day uh a lot of Jews if they leave their home are under their law are prohibited to even carry car keys or push a baby in a stroller &gt;&gt; because that's work. That's the level of thou shalt not work on the Sabbath day. That's the level that they take it to, right? Like that's kind of oppressive, &gt;&gt; right? You can't even can't even push your baby in a stroller. Like that's work. I don't think it's work, right? You got an easy job if you think that's work. Um and and so, you know, that's the level they would take it to. Can't even carry something in your pocket. You keep, you know, your car keys can't you wallet in your pocket is is too heavy and to be, you know, and now it's considered work. And this rabbi, he was talking about this. He goes, "Yeah." So, actually, biblically, that's not prohibited, but rabbitically under under the law of the rabbis it is, right? So, they've taken the the, you know, the law of the Bible and gone way over here with it, right? Way more extreme. And so, here they are hyper extreme with what they can do. And then the whole reason is because there's this there's this concept, if I have it in my notes, because there's it's a Jewish word. Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Uh um I believe it's pronounced the Arav. It's E R UV if anyone wants to look this up if you don't believe me. So what they you see this in big cities like New York where there's large Jewish populations and they'll have their Jewish community and what they will do is they will take some fishing line and they will connect fishing line all around like a whole city block all the way this huge section of the city that goes out of their house. is way outside the house, the big old section of the city. And because the way it's connected and it connects back to their house legally speaking, everything inside that fishing line is part of their house. No joke, no lie. That's what it means. And so that means they can do all the stuff that they're prohibited from doing on the Sabbath day inside the fishing string. Like fool, God, what? No, that's not how that works. You didn't find a loophole, right? You didn't fool God with a fishing line because you think you found some loophole because God's judging your heart and your heart is saying, "I don't really want to follow the law, but I feel like I kind of got to. So, I'm going to I'm going to go find some edge case and just push it to its absolute limit so that I can just do whatever I want anyways." That's what legalism does. And you'll find this half the time when someone's hyper legalistic, you start looking long enough and you'll find some they'll have some fishing line around some big stuff, &gt;&gt; right? Like this is wild what people will do and then and then have all kinds of justifications for it, right? I have all kinds of reasons why their particular quote that they've like, you know, taken a a a razor blade and carved out all the context out of this quote and presented that or some scripture or whatever. And it's like, guys, I really feel like you're you're kind of missing the spirit of what's going on here, &gt;&gt; you know? Like, look, we say in the message all the time that the that the the the holiness standard, the Christian experience is not a list of dos and don'ts. We say that all the time. Okay. Now, it's not a list of dos and don'ts. That's true. That's accurate 100%. But that doesn't mean that it's there aren't dos and don'ts, &gt;&gt; right? Similarly to a marriage, right? Remember this whole thing is a pattern of a family. The relationship with Christ in the church is the same as a husband and a wife. And if me and my wife who I love very very much on our wedding day got the lawyers together to put together a you know our legal obligations to the marriage and you know these are my you know salary obligations and I'm going to pay for so many vacations a year and give her so much shopping money and and you know there's all the you know breach of contract clauses and then you know she's going to clean the house and the kids take care of the kids and cook me hot dinner as soon as I get home and all these different things. and we're putting this into some sort of legal contract. I really feel like maybe we oughtn't get married because there's no heart there. You're you're condensing. And the problem is if you try to condense all the infinite ways y'all are going to get on each other's nerves into a legal document, I guarantee you there's going to be a whole lot of stuff not on that list. I guarantee there's going to be a lot of stuff not on the list of dos and don'ts. And when you get a legalist and they find something not on the list, boy howdy, they're going to swing for the fences, &gt;&gt; right? You have And so if you try to condense a marriage down to a a formal contract, the minute you get a an edge case that can't that there's no guidance on, man, you're really going to stick it to that other person, &gt;&gt; right? Because there ain't nothing on the list. I can do what I want now. Well, hang on. If I love my wife, I don't need a list. I don't need to be told these things because I care about her and I might get some stuff wrong. I might even have to apologize for some stuff, which I do on a regular basis. However, I'm motivated to do that. I'm motivated to apologize. I don't need a list because everyone's going to do things wrong. The the the the law, you'll never never actually live up to the law. And you know, and like you you I'll give you here's a kind of a crazy example, a ludicrous illustration, right? If if you have if you're just breaking a marriage down to a list of thou shalt not and you know and and thou shalt not commit adultery and then you have say you have imagine some woman being like well thou shalt not commit adultery but there's this other man that is very handsome and he buys me dinner and we go on long walks to the beach and he buys me flowers and tells me how beautiful I am but we've never technically committed adultery. Okay. technically, but that seems really adulterous, right? &gt;&gt; It seems really wrong is obviously you your heart's checked out of your marriage. Your heart, your husband doesn't have your heart. This other man does and then you tell go fly a kite. You won't have anything to do with him, right? And so, you know, this is what happens when you get young people who are like, "Well, you know, I don't cut my hair. I burn it off with a curling iron." Well, that just shows you that you don't have the Holy Ghost, teenager. You know, well, you know, I have this reason why I can put makeup on my face. Well, okay. Go ask look at what brother Brandham said about having putting makeup on your face and tell me if you got the Holy Ghost and you can try to wiggle around that all you want to sister but um you know I think maybe you're just trying to wrap some string around that you know hey young man you know brother Brandham had a lot of really uncomfortable things to say about the way you cut your hair and you can sit there and say well you know brother Bandom used the Beatles as an example and their hair was you know 3/4 of an inch above their eyebrows and mine is a full inch and that makes me different. Really? Are you sure? Or are you just trying to wrap some string around it? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Are you just trying to wrap some string around it? Maybe you should just lay the string down and admit that you have a problem. &gt;&gt; Maybe you should lay the string down and say, "Lord, I you I have not given you my heart." &gt;&gt; You know, I maybe that's what's going on here. Because you can think that you have the Holy Ghost a lot. And and the problem is, you know, I I'm going to I'm going to read some quotes here just because I feel like maybe someone might not believe me. This is from Perseverance. It says, "We believe God by faith because God said so." Then what is it? Abraham was justified by Paul by faith, but by James by works. Abraham was talking what God saw and James was talking about what man saw. Show me your faith by your works. &gt;&gt; Then if you don't have works with your faith, it shows you haven't got faith. &gt;&gt; You're just talking from your mouth. But if you really got faith, you believe it and you act like it. Right? &gt;&gt; This is from presuming. But you say, "Well, I dance in the spirit. I spoke with tongues. I might have done uh I might have done these things." That's fine. Yes, sir. That's all right. But if that life hasn't straightened up, if you men still smoke cigarettes, tell jokes, take sociable drinks, lie, cheat, not honest with your neighbor, you know, you you you men who are out there doing work in the in the world, if you are lying to your customers, you might want to go find an author. If you are if you are doing if you are not a 100% clear with the and and upfront and honest in your business dealings, you might need to go find an author. &gt;&gt; Not even honest with your family. If you if you have one standard that you're living, dads, fathers, husbands, if you have one standard that you live in front of your family and a different standard that you live when they're not around, uh you might need to go find an altar. &gt;&gt; You might have a problem. You might just be putting on a front. Go listen to the message Pride. Brother Brandham says that a Pharisee is an actor. That's what he is. And if you're putting on a show for somebody that your Christian experience is one way in public and a different way in private, maybe you're a Pharisee and you need to stop cut the string out of your life. &gt;&gt; Lay that stuff down and be genuine. &gt;&gt; Go let get the let the Lord deal with your heart because something's wrong. &gt;&gt; He says, uh, honest with your neighbor, not even honest with your family. See, and claim to have the Holy Ghost. Don't you testify that no more, brother. &gt;&gt; Right? Because that's what he's talking about. People claiming to have the Holy Ghost and they ain't got the Holy Ghost. [snorts] Claim to have the Holy Ghost, but uh maybe you don't. And if you claim to have the Holy Ghost and you don't, God will judge you as if you do. There won't be grace for that for the things. You know, you see what I'm saying? You claim to be something you're not. And God will judge you based off of your testimony. This is also from presuming. Um, and you women that hasn't the common decency to let your hair grow out like God told you to. In case anybody was wondering about a curling iron, he just said grow your hair out. Didn't say anything about scissors. That's right. The Bible says that a woman that will bob her hair dishonors her head and that dishonors her husband. And you that will wear these little old garments like the rest of the world wears. The Bible says that he a woman that will put on a garment that pertains to a man is an abomination, filthy in the sight of God. And then you claim to have the Holy Ghost. You're presuming you've got it, but when you get it, it cleans you up. That's right. It makes you different. You that claim you have the Holy Ghost and you that's got long hair. Now, now notice you that claim Now he's So, he's just talked to the woman who got short hair and makeup and all these other things. Now, he's talking to this the woman that's got long hair. You that claim you have the Holy Ghost. and you that's got long hair and wear your dresses neat and everything like that and you'll stay home on Wednesday night to watch a program, a television program instead of going to church to prayer meeting. You're presuming you got the Holy Ghost. For when the Holy Ghost is there, the love of God is so constrained in you that you just can't stay away from those people. you that has to be forced to prayer and he just kind of trails off dot dot dot you know you that's got to be forced to pray I don't know about you know and so I would just as a bullet point in my notes you are not saved by your works this is obvious like in case you were didn't catch this is not me this is not the brother brand I'm speaking this is me you are not saved by your works and your works are not the evidence that you positively do have the new birth. &gt;&gt; However, a life of sin and ungodliness, a lack of dedication and sincerity is a pretty good indication that you do not have the new birth. &gt;&gt; Okay? Evidence that you do and evidence that you do not are not the same thing. Okay? A Pharisee can put on a show only God knows his heart. But you're not going to convince me or Brother Brandham that you can just go live any old kind of way and be like, "Well, I believe in my heart and my faith will save me." Your repentance may if you repent and repent, be baptized, and accept the new birth, then yes. But if you're just out there living any old kind of way and you're just disregarding the standards of holiness, well, man, I don't know that you've got you've passed from death unto life because if you love God, you'll keep his commandments, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It shows if you're out here finding edge cases, if you're out here running for just searching for loopholes so you can cram whatever you want into your lifestyle, I don't know that you really h have a love for God in your heart. The same way that if I'm out here looking for any excuse to go flirt with another woman, I don't have a good marriage, &gt;&gt; right? Clearly, this is the natural typing, the spiritual. If you're dead, not dedicated to your heavenly husband, you don't I'm sorry. I you should really question whether or not you have the Holy Ghost, you know, and I know that that seems harsh, but look, that's I would rather say something harsh that is accurate and true and be sure in what I know and what I believe than to go blundering blindly into a bear trap. &gt;&gt; Right? It's not. Love is kind and love is patient and loves a lot of things, but love is not so soft that it can't have confrontation with somebody when that person is going down a really bad path. &gt;&gt; Okay. If you see little Johnny playing in the street and there's a car coming and you just go, "Oh, well, you know, I don't want to like bother him and you know, he's he's living his life and I don't want to be seen as some sort of fanatic. Well, you can try to rearrange that as that you having love for little Johnny. But when little Johnny is splattered over the front bumper of that pickup truck, uh you didn't love him. &gt;&gt; You condemned him. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU LET HIM DIE CUZ YOU WERE SO CHICKENENED. You didn't want to have a difficult conversation. That's not love to say nothing when people are in danger &gt;&gt; because you don't want to be seen as judgmental or or a you know a legalist. [sighs] It's not listen you you being so soft that we that we can't or or rather being so un uh so so committed to niceness that we can't that we sacrifice the truth. That's not kindness. &gt;&gt; It's not love. &gt;&gt; That's that's that's that's hatred. &gt;&gt; That's actually sophisticated hatred. &gt;&gt; It's a very sophisticated form of hatred that gives the hateful plausible deniability against their own conscience. &gt;&gt; It lets you hate people actually behave hatefully towards them and not actually let your conscience bother you about it. That's the truth. And so, you know, when somebody says something harsh to you and it's said in love, you should probably listen, &gt;&gt; right? That's the most loving thing someone can do. Actually, it's one of the most loving things because man, it's not pleasant to have to be the person to say some hard truth. It's really difficult actually. Nobody likes it. This is from This is from God of This Evil Age. And Brother Brandham, I don't have the time to really read this whole thing. I'd be reading half the sermon if I did. But um Brother Brandham is kind of going down this list. He's he's kind of illustrating this point of the the world and how the world is being being duped and and conned and and and seduced by the god of this evil age and how they they they they love what he does, right? Satan tells them all the things that that kind of tickle their ear and and and and gives pleasure to their heart, right? that they he excuse me gives them the justification for all the things they want to do. Right? So he says she can wear shorts, wear paint and still belong to his religious group, meaning Satan's religious group, which is absolutely contrary to the word of God. He says it's all right. God said not to do it, but he does. And she believes him and she loves him for it. She hates God. Her own actions prove she does. She says she loves him, but she loves Satan. She worships the God of fashion, the God of the world, the Hollywood goddesses. She loves him, but she hates the true word of God, which is the only true word there is. Skipping down, he says, "Oh, look at him today. God is a good God. You're in his holy church. Why? You can't die, right? You can't die. Do whatever you want. If you're one of gods, he'll get you. He will. You will regret what you did, but he will get you. But that's the that's the God of this evil age whispering in your ear, "Oh, why? You can't die." But God said you would and that settles it. See him today? Oh, just belong to a church. It ain't what you do or this, that, or the other. Just come to church and be a good member. Cutting your hair, that's nonsense. And wearing shorts and putting on paint and going to dances and a little beer once in a while won't hurt you as long as you don't indulge in it. You know, Dad, it's been a long day at work. You know, you unwind a little. Careful. You watch it. That ain't going to stay that way. That's the god of this evil age trying to trying to feed you a line, right? Indulge in it. Frankly, I wish you children would take it so that they could learn whether they like it or not. Oh, doesn't that sound so logical? Isn't that so reasonable? There he is. The god of this age, this evil age. God is a good God. God is a good God. I've heard that so much till I get sick. God is also a God of justice. He ain't an oldie grandpa that can be pushed around and his grandkids don't have any sin. He's a God of justice and holiness. He proved it in the Garden of Eden by his first children. You cross that line of one of his words and you're dead. Same thing applies today. Okay. And so now we're coming down to the point where, you know, it's not about a list of dos and don'ts because a list of dos and don'ts ain't going to cut it. It's about whether or not God has your heart. &gt;&gt; It's about whether or not you're really dedicated. Because the fact of the matter is you nor I nor brother Jason or brother Matt or even brother Brandham was ever going to have a shot at actually being perfect on this side. Right? As long as you are shackled to this flesh, you're going to have problems. You're going to have to have new mercies every single morning. You're not going to get it right all the time. You're not. But, you know, if my wife does something maybe, you know, or or you know, me and my wife have a disagreement and one of us kind of, you know, just gets a little bit too um aggressive in our advocation for our perspective. Um [laughter] I don't know that I could. Um you know, and and you know, we we get a little too heated in the moment. We have each other's heart. And even though there may be hurt feelings, there's always going to be an I'm so sorry, honey. I didn't mean that. Please forgive me. I didn't mean to do that. And there's going to be a reconciliation there because there's a heartto-heart connection. There's a deep calling to a deep there, right? There's a there's a you know th these sorts of things. You're never going to be 100% right in everything. But if God has your heart, then he knows it was an accident. He knows it was a mistake. He knows it wasn't just you looking for an excuse, right? And so the moment that a marriage gets to the point where someone's looking for an excuse, boy, call the pastor because you need some counseling, right? You got a problem. Because if you don't get that under control, you're going to end up in family court, right? That's where that goes. When when one person in the marriage starts looking for excuses. And so you know what the the fact of the matter is in a marriage because ultimately all of this we can we can we can have a lot of discussion about deep dark things and and and mysteries and the spoken word and all these different things. But until we can really condense it down to the family and the way our family functions we have a lot of education and not a lot of practical experience. And you know, in a marriage, um, men and women are different. I don't know if anybody has figured that out. Men and women are very, very different, and we're called to different things. The Bible actually treats us very differently. Okay. Um, you know, here's a great illustration of this. Um, you know, in Proverbs 31, I'm sure everyone's familiar with Proverbs 31. It's the it's the chapter in Proverbs that deals with you know this is the ideal woman basically right this is the ideal this is God's standard for women and how women are to conduct themselves as wives and as mothers it's very great many many men have preached very many wonderful sermons out of Proverbs 31 and um the equivalent for men is the other 30 chapters go read proverbs every chapter like from Proverbs 1 to Proverbs 30 is like, "My son, do this." It's it's 30 chapters of God trying to get men in line and one chapter for women. &gt;&gt; Women have one chapter to live UP TO. MEN HAVE 30. The other way to look at this is this is, you know, book of Proverbs written for young men. It's it's it's a great book to read to kids because especially young men, you know, teenage boys. Hey, this is what you got. you know, this is how to pattern your life. It's written, it was intentionally written for young men as an educational tool. Notice how it's arranged. It's the last chapter that talks about what your life, your wife is supposed to be like. You don't even get to ask the question of what the woman's standard is until you get through the first 30 dealing with the man. the man. You husbands, you don't get to point your finger at your wife until you've gone through the first 30 chapters of Proverbs. Okay, that's the reality here. You bear way more responsibility than she does. Every her headship is on your shoulders. You are responsible for her. That means you bear way more burden here. It you've got th You got to live up to 30 chapters, right? That's what you've got. You It's 30 to1. That's the ratio for one thing she's got to live up to. You've got 30. &gt;&gt; Sisters, have some grace. have a little bit of of of understanding that, you know, this is why. Okay, I let's let's I'm gonna Oh boy, I'm gonna get rocks thrown at me now. Um, but we we got to do it. Um, let's turn to First Peter 3 and one. First Peter 3, chapter 3. Let me pull it up here. Do we have it on the screen? There we go. 1 Peter 3 and1 likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey your own husbands um that if any obey not the word they also may be without the word be one by the conversation of the wives while they behold your chasteed conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be that of outward adorning of platting of hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel, but let it be the hidden man of the heart, and that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is the sight of God great price. For after this manner in the old time, the holy women also who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands, even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord, whose daughters ye are, as long as you do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. Okay, let's turn to Ephesians chapter 5. All right. Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 22. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church, and he is the savior of the body. Therefore, as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything. Okay? And Genesis 3 and 16. And it says, "Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy and thy conception. in sorrow. Thou shalt bring forth children, and thy desire shall be unto thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. Now, I better have something real good to say because the fact of the matter is, you know, you read verses like this, you read scriptures like this, and a lot of sisters get their hackles up, right? You get you get you're like, "Okay, what this is?" And a lot of it has to do with just like sort of like the modern culture that we have this very feminist culture of like well you know if a woman is subject to a man that's like oppressive and that's like um not very feminist and you know this is the 21st century and you know women can vote now and you know look that's not what God intended. God never intended for any of his daughters to be strong, independent women who didn't need a man. Okay? That's not what he intended for anybody, right? God made the woman to be the helpmate of the man. And the problem is, you know, a lot of people get kind of on edge when you say things like this. A lot of women get very like, "Oh, I don't like that." they feel some kind of way, you know, whether or whether it's whether it's, you know, man, no man's going to rule over me and, you know, besides, my husband is this, that, or the other, and I just don't think he's very competent and I I, you know, I don't trust him. And most of the time it's it's it's most of the time it's I don't trust him actually. Um, or maybe it's, you know, um, maybe I wish I he would take charge in our relationship a little bit more, but he just won't, and he's just a little soft. Look, the fact of the matter is anytime a sister is having a negative reaction to the idea of her husband ruling over her, it's a big indication that there's a big problem in your marriage, it's a big old red flag because if the natural type is the spiritual, right? The natural, we all say this natural type is spiritual. And if this is supposed to be pattern after Christ and the bride, at what point at what point does a Christian say, well, you know, I think that, you know, God can be my savior and God can be my provider and my protector, but I don't think he should be my Lord. You know, I don't think I want to give God all of me. I don't want to give God total surrender. Well, man, I don't know that you're a Christian if that's your attitude, right? Well, sister, if that's your attitude that you're not willing to give your husband total surrender, have a problem. Something's going on there. Right now, granted, the problem in the marriage might be him. Right? He might be the problem. However, if your reaction is to go, "Well, it's definitely him." Uh, no, it's not. Right? And brothers, if your reaction to this is be like, h the women these days, ain't none of them want to be submissive. You're the problem. As a matter of fact, you both might be the problem actually. And usually in a marriage, you know who the problem is by whoever's pointing fingers at the other person actually. That in reality, [snorts] you're both right about each other. And the reality is it's not 50/50. No marriage ever is unless you're dividing assets in family court, right? That's the only time a marriage is 50/50 or you know that's where that that's where that ends. If a marriage is strong, it's 100. Both parties are 100% committed. Now the commitment that you have is a little bit different, right? Because the man is supposed to be head of the of the wife and it says Christ was head of the church. Well, what was Christ? Christ was 100% sacrificial. He was he was self-sacrificing. He laid his life down for his for his his bride. And you have the husband has to be 100% self-sacrificing. And if he's not, he's holding something back and like, well, I mean, I don't want to give 100%. If I sacrifice 100%, she's just going to take advantage of me. Well, okay, then that's just some prenup thinking, right? That's just like then you don't trust her. You have a problem. Go get counseling or something. I don't know. Go talk to each other. How about that? Start there. Right? If you want to look, if if the devil's going to break you, he'll break your communication first. Right? And that's honestly that's one of the big problems with marriages is because people don't communicate. Men think very differently than women. And when a woman says something, the man hears something very different than what she meant, right? and then he says something and she hears something very different than what he meant. Here's a great example. Um maybe some of you have experienced this. You're out and about and you're riding around in the car and then your wife says, "Hey, I'm hungry." And he says, "Okay, where'd you like to eat?" And she's like, "I don't know. You pick." He says, "Taco Bell." And she says, "No, not there." And he says, "All [snorts] right, well, when you figure it out, let me know and we'll go wherever you want. And then kind of drive in silence for a few minutes and then she kind of gets a tear running down her eye and she looks at him and goes, "Why did you marry ME IF YOU DON'T LOVE ME?" NOW, if this has never happened to you and you don't know what just happened, you're probably the man. And what actually happened is both of these people were in the same conversation and they heard entirely different things. Okay? Because what he heard his what his perception of the conversation was went something like she said, "Honey, I'm hungry." And he said, "My darling, my sweet, my everything, whatever you want unto the half of my kingdom, I will give you. I will lay my life down to give you whatever your heart desires. And she heard her conversation was, "Hey, I have a problem. Will you please help me fix it?" And he looked at her and said, "Fix it yourself." Right? That's what happens. And it's like because she's going, "Hey, I need you to help me solve this problem." And and what she actually wanted actually most of the time is she wanted you to ask her where she likes to eat when she's not hungry so that when she says, "Hey, I'm hungry." You can go, "Oh, I got you, boo. I know where we're going." Right? That's what's actually supposed um and if you do that, if you just because because she's trying to figure out if your heart is with her, she's giving you an opportunity to be a hero, dude. Right? She's giving you an opportunity to read her mind and you did that by asking questions like yesterday, right? Don't but but men don't think that way. This is like I heard somebody say one time that this is the this is the level of thinking that comes from the gender that thinks shaving off their eyebrows and drawing on new ones is a perfectly reasonable solution to already having eyebrows. You know, men don't think this way and women apparently do, but you know, it it doesn't make them women bad and it doesn't make men bad, you know. And the perception is that the women think that men are really dumb. Like, did you not get this? All you had to do was ask me what I wanted to eat like yesterday and you'd have known the answer. All you had to do was like care about me at all, man. Right? That's why she's going LIKE, "WHY DON'T YOU LOVE ME?" Because you because in her mind, you didn't do the stuff that you would need to do in order to prove that you loved her. You didn't show any interest in her because if you had, you'd have known that she doesn't like Taco Bell. She likes Del Taco. And you know, sister, because he thinks like problem solution, [snorts] and he's very uninterested in what he eats for lunch, right? Like it doesn't matter. It could have been Taco Bell. It could have been Wendy's. It could have been anything. It could have been like the the sketchy taco stand. It's really great, but man, it gives you indigestion, but it doesn't like he doesn't care. And so, when you come to him with a problem, he's going to think of a solution, and he's not seeing it as an opportunity to prove that he's a hero. He's at least the way you're thinking. And so, you're going to talk right past each other. And that doesn't make one or the other bad. It just means that you need to have a decent conversation and have some love one for the other. And when one gets their feelings hurt, the other one says, "Honey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that." And the other one goes, "I forgive you. I understand." And if you're not able to do that, you really got to fix that. Because what happens is here's what happens. When the wife, notice, and I read this this scripture in Genesis, right, where God says to the woman, "Your desire shall be under your husband, and he shall rule over you." You know what that means? It means that there is a God like spoken word link between headship and a woman's desire. Wowzers. She's never going to be able to submit to a man that she doesn't have a heart connection with. It's not going to happen. Hey husbands, you've got a real big job. And that job is to is to prove to your wife that you love her like every day. Every single day, right? You can't just let that go. You don't just get to be like, "Well, I told you I loved you once at the altar, and if it changes, I'll notify you." That's not how that's going to work. You've got to prove this on the regular cuz she forgets. She's got a totally different neurological package than you. And that's absolutely how that works, right? And man, I could go into the science on that, but we'd be here for a long time. Look, she's wired different than you are. You're wired different than she is. This is why this is why it can get really really dangerous for women. Okay, look. I saw a picture one time of a stop sign that had a tree growing out of the top of it, right? It's a pipe stop sign with a sign bolted inside of it. It's got like concrete poured under it and there's like a thing and like how in the world did this seed, this little seed of God was poured under concrete and it found the stop sign and even though it was a sign that said stop it, the seed didn't stop and it just blew out the top and there's a whole sapling growing out the top of a stop sign. When God spoke this that your desire should be under your husband and he shall rule over you, that's a spoken word of God that's going to come out somewhere. And in this modern day, we can pour concrete on top of that. We can put a big sign that says stop on top of that. It's not going to stop. It's going to come out somewhere. And if you don't do this in a godly fashion, if you don't find a way to have a heart-to-heart connection with your spouse and so that the wife can submit to her husband in a godly fashion that he can be a headship to her in a godly fashion as a gentleman, as kind and caring as Christ would and being sacrificial and doing all of these things. and that so that she can be totally submissive to him in in a godly fashion. If you don't do this, it'll come out somewhere else and it'll come out to twisted and it'll come out perverted and it'll come out as a Satan uh serpent seed alternative. That's where it'll come out and we know this like I'll give you a great example of this and I wower it got laid on me. I should have set a timer. Um, then I preached right through it. Um, the the Okay, so who here? Okay, I'm not going to ask for a show of hands. I'm going to assume that all of you have seen Beauty and the Beast or at least familiar with the concept. Beauty and the Beast was written by a feminist woman as a Disney princess to be a feminist icon to little girls. And Beauty and the Beast is a story of a pretty young girl whose father, her headship, is basically completely irrelevant. She basically disregards him. Like, I mean, she loves him. And there's like a whole side plot with that, but she's he has absolutely no impact on her romantic life. And she's an intellectual. She's very smart, and she's bookish. And she ends up getting kidnapped, captured against her will by a beast who walks on two feet. And you know the kind of beast who walks on two feet and kidnaps women. and she is kidnapped by this beast and she can't stand him and he's very clearly not a good person until one day he shows her an act of kindness and and they have like this little connection and then he shows her he has an actual great library in his house in this castle that she's been imprisoned in and then suddenly there's just something there that wasn't there before and woo and it's strange and a bit alarming why is it strange and alarming is because her head she knows in her conscience this is really really wrong but all the psychological buttons have been pushed and now she's folded like a lawn chair right that's what happens and so you know she ends up she by the end of this movie this predator who walks on two feet who has kidnapped her and won her heart apparently that everybody in the town knows is dangerous and she's going, "Oh no, he's not dangerous. He's just misunderstood because he wouldn't hurt me. He loves me." And you realize that this feminist icon, this icon for little girls is the story of Eve and the Serpent. It's a beast who walks on two feet and he wins her heart by imparting to her vast knowledge in the form of books. And by the end of it, she's going, "Oh, he's just misunderstood all of the all of the instru Oh, and by the way, this she only got here because she rejected the headship of her heavenly father." And this is a little cartoon that we show to little girls. And then we wonder like 90 whatever it was the 90s I don't remember exactly when it came out and this is the message that we give to little girls and then in like 15 years ago when I was a teenage boy like 15 you have half the women in the country including a lot of women in the message I might add having a genuine informed opinion on whether or not they're team Edward or team Jacob. Uhhuh. Okay, for those of you who aren't picking up what I'm putting down, a lot of women are getting having an opinion on whether or not they are you want to be romantically involved with a werewolf or a vampire. What in the world? There's clearly something twisted happening here. And it's only gotten worse from there. You go through all like I married to a former librarian's assistant. I have the inside track on these things. Modern romance literature, you know how how prolific this stuff is and like the number of modern romance novels involve a kidnapping, involve a man forcefully imposing dominion over the woman. And they're all written by feminists who would, if you would have said something like the husband is to be head of the wife, would burn you at the stake. But yet in all of their romantic literature that they just want this this you know stud mcunkley to sweep them off their feet, he's kidnapping them. What what's happened here? There's a seed of God that God said that your headship will rule over you. That your desire is going to be linked to rulership. And if you squash that, if you don't actually do this in a godly fashion, you're going to end up with something perverted. You're going to end up with a beast who walks on two feet and is a kidnapper and a predator. Someone who will ruin your life. And at the end of it, you're going, "Oh, he's just misunderstood." This is what happens. Dads with little girls, that's mean, by the way. You, oh man, that this one terrifies me. if you're not living up to the standard of Christ and you're being God in the flesh to that little girl that she can grow up and say and have a real genuine understanding of what a godly headship is supposed to be. That you are jealous over that little girl with a godly jealousy. That you're not just going to be disinterested in the boys she hangs out with. that you're not going to just be uninvolved when her heart is being wooed by some some man. If you're if if if that's not if that's if you're just going to abdicate that responsibility and just be like, "Oh, well, you know, if they're one of gods, God will get them." Yeah, God will. But boy, what kind of scars are they going to come back with? If you're a dad of a little girl and you're not from the day she is born fighting with tooth and nail to win her heart, you can because the fact of the matter is you can build you can build the garden of Eden around your children. You can build the garden of Eden around them. You can have tapes playing non-stop godly music. Do family altar night and day, you know, do devotions, uh, uh, take him to church, you know, Sunday and Wednesday and stream someone else on Friday. You can do everything that you can could possibly think of and and and have the spirit of God in your home. If you do not win their heart, they will leave just like Adam did. You didn't get their heart and their heart leaves your home. What was the point? All your piety does is serve to put a flaming sword between you and your children. That's not to say none of those things are good. You should do it 100%. Do your family altar. Do your devotions. Bring your children to church. Do all of the above. But make sure above everything else you get their heart. If you don't if you don't get that little girl's heart, I guarantee you. I promise you. I guarantee you by the word OF GOD, I PROMISE you there will be the devil's alternative waiting in the wings for her. If dad isn't there to win that little girl's heart and make sure she knows that there's a man who loves her and can give her be God in the flesh for her, some disciple of Andrew Tate will do it for you. And he's not going to be a gentleman about it. He's going to be a pervert pervert about it. And he's going to take what he wants from her and he will dump her on the curb. And you will be responsible because you didn't do your job. And dads of little boys, you have a responsibility to be a leader, to show that little boy what a gentleman does, to show that little boy how a gentleman behaves. to be a an example of what a leader is and not shy away from the fact that you're going to be in charge. Don't teach your little boys that you just got to cave over. And oh man, you know, we say, you know, like the whole happy wife, happy life thing, and it's true to a large part, but man, if that becomes a doctrine and you just get rolled over by your wife at every turn, and that's the example you give to your little boys, you're not a leader. You're just a follower. You're following. You've got the you've got the the the type completely upside down. Christ doesn't follow the church. The church follows Christ. If you're not being the leader, if you don't if you in your home cannot have any authority and your wife just tells you what to do and she's the boss, how spineless are you? And that's not to say that, you know, and granted it takes it takes the wife to submit. I get that. But if you're not even going to try, if you're just going to roll over because you don't want to have a difficult conversation, you don't want to have a confrontation. And that's the pattern you give to your young men. Don't be surprised when Andrew Tate teaches them how to be a man for you. And they're he's not going to do it the way you want him to. They're not going to come out the way you want them to be. Because at the end of the day, I'm sorry I've kept you on way too late. At the end of the day, um, can I let's get the musicians and we'll we'll button this up. At the end of the day, when it when everything's said and done, this has never been about the the specifics of what you do. Your Christian walk has never been about the specifics of what you do or don't do or the particular measuring line that you live up to. It's about where your heart lies. You can be a good dad or you can be a bad dad or you can be all kinds of things. You can have massive failures. I know I have. I've had cataclysmic failures as a husband in my marriage. But I will always pick up. I will always get back up and keep fighting. I will always fight with my tooth and nail to win that little pretty little red head's heart every single morning, every single day because that's what matters because there's a heart connection there. And every single time and you know you you know I we can't see I can't see your heart. God knows your heart. God can judge your heart. I can't. But the Lord knows when you're being honest with him. The Lord knows when you're just trying to run some string around your life and and cram something in there that doesn't belong. The Lord knows. And you know, at the end of the day, it's between you and God. At the end of the day, it's a it's a romance. The Bible's a romance. It's what it is. It's it's the it's it's a it's a it's a it's God's love letter to his to his wife. And he's trying to win your heart. So, let him do it. Don't be resistant to that. You know, I I the Bible calls it the foolishness of preaching. I feel that a lot. Sometimes I feel very foolish. Most of the time, every pretty much every time I feel very foolish and I'm sorry if I've offended anybody, if I've said something that bothered someone, I don't mean to be bothered. I don't mean to hurt anybody. If I ever said anything that hurt anybody, I'd never meant it to be hurtful. You know, there's a lot of places I'd much rather be than behind a pullpit. I never set out to be a preacher. Um, I honestly would rather be shot at most of the time than get behind a pull pit. Um, but it turns out the Lord can do things to you that are a whole lot worse than getting shot at. And you know, if I've said anything that pricked your heart, that made you consider, Lord, that I'm not in the right place, that I'm I'm following a pattern that's not accurate, that I'm off the mark, that wasn't me. I don't I'm nobody, you know? I I know the I know the ridiculousness of me giving anybody advice. I'm not a good person. I was never a good person. Most of the most of everything I've learned I've learned through making a train wreck. I I don't know I don't know what any advice to give anybody. All I know is that the word says things. The Bible says things and I can present to you what I see in the in the message and I can present to you what I see in the word and I can present to you what the Lord has put on my heart. And if that touches something in your heart, you can rest assured that wasn't me. I didn't do it. The Lord did. If this is if it if something that was said that addresses something that you've been dealing with, the Lord did that. I didn't say that. [music] You know, I I could never There's too many of you. I can't I can't I can't follow all of you around all day. I don't know what you guys are going what's going on in your lives. I've got my own life. I hardly know what's going on in that. So, you know, I say all this to say that, you know, this in this day and age, there's it's way way way too late in the game to be trying to just get by. It's way too late in the age where time is way too close to be unsure to be unconcerned about the relationship between you and God. you know, the the Lord the Lord, you know, that this that quote where that I read, you know, show me your your you know, James James says you're you're justified by your works and Paul said you're justified by your faith, right? And brother Ram said that the faith is what God sees and and and your works are what man sees. You know, if there's that that little pull in your heart and whatever it is, and you know, Look, I said this once before, not every single thing, not absolutely everything that you're going to need in life is going to is going to just be revealed to you as soon as you get the Holy Ghost, right? Sometimes you're just going to have to learn stuff. Sometimes it's going to come over the pulpit. Sometimes it's going to come through experience. Sometimes it's going to come from study. But the Lord wants your heart. Cuz if he has your heart, he's got the whole ball game, right? Me and my wife, we can have disagreements. We can have fights. We can we can butt heads. If any of you guys knew us when we were younger, you know, we buted heads like crazy. The amount of people that were like, "Wow, those te people should stay away from each other cuz they are really, really toxic." [music] And yet we're married. We love each other. And I wouldn't have it any other way. We don't We fight sometimes, but we don't fight like we used to. Fight. We're better at it now. Um but the fact of the matter is that girl had my heart and she had mine or I had hers and she had mine. And no matter how much we would butt heads, no matter how difficult things were, having each other's hearts the whole ball game. That's it. They they what's what's left? You'll get through anything. And the Lord wants your heart. He wants that dedication. Friend, if you know, brother Brandham said, if you those that need to be forced to pray, man, that so struck me that line, those who need to be forced to pray. Friend, when was the last time you prayed? When was the last time you woke up in the morning and said, "Lord, I'm going to spend some time just praying." When was the last time? How often do we do that? Let the Let the Lord build a relationship with you. Let the Lord get your heart. Because if he has your heart, man, it doesn't it's not about having a legal system. My wife doesn't have to put a gun to my head to make me love her. She's got everything. She's got my everything. She's got way more than I could ever give her. So, I guess, you know, I'll close. I' I've said enough. It's 9:00. If I could just say that, be really, really sure. Be really careful. Examine your life and make make absolutely certain you're not just trying to wrap string around stuff and just make loopholes for things. Be really dedicated. What you do matters to God because it's an indication of where your heart lies. Those little things, those little foxes that we just let in and say, "Oh, it ain't no big deal." They're a big deal. Little foxes turn into big foxes. You know that little that little thing, Dad. That little thing that you hide from your kids, they'll find it one day. They'll find it one day. No, you that bottle that you want to unwind with on the way home from work, they'll find the bottle. You thought you hid it in your truck. They didn't. You didn't. They'll find it. The devil will make sure your kids find all of your faults. And when he does, every problem that you have, your kids will find it. And the devil will do that so that he has a justification for why they don't need to listen to you. Young people, your parents are going to fail you. They're going to catastrophically fail you. They're going to do it and half the time they won't even realize because they didn't know. That is not a reason to give up on God. That is the reason you don't. They are the first representation of God that you will see. That's true. They're not God. They're going to fail. Don't let their failures be the reason that something that comes between you and God. God's trying to win your heart. Don't let the things of this world come between you and that. I'm done. Let's Let's stand. Kind of end my service with a word of prayer. Father Lord, we come before you this evening. I've said my heart. I've spoken the burden that you've put on my heart. I trust that it was not just a waste of time. Lord, though I may feel foolish sometimes, I I move forward and I say what's on my heart because Father, you're you told me to go and so I went. So, Father, if something was said this evening that would help somebody, I ask that you would go with that word, help it to grow, be with the people. as we dis turn to the prayer service this evening, Father, that those words that were said that would be of of help, Lord, that they would take root, that people would not be forgetful, that as they would face the world, as they would exit this evening, return to their jobs and their lives tomorrow, Lord, something would go with them. Give them encouragement. We ask these things in your holy and precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Let's all gather and we'll take up the uh Oh, well, didn't read the text.

Father, that that we know that she worked with children, Father, that Lord, that whatever bug or would be going around, Lord, that it would be stopped right now, Father, that' be you would be shut down. That Lord, that by your stripes, our dear sister is healed right now. We we thank you for this, Lord. We claim it. We ask that you would be with the people, Father, this evening that those who would have a need upon their heart, Lord, as they would go, they would uplift a hand to you right now, Lord, that you would be able to meet them here. That Father, no matter what it may be, whatever whatever they would have need, oh Father, that you would meet them here this evening, that Father, what that you said that you would be the meter of our needs, that you would be Jehovah Gyra, that you would see it and you would see to it, Lord, that you see our hearts. that that is that our faith would would cry out to you, Lord. And that you would that as the the the the deep of our heart would call out to you, that Lord, that there would be a deep in your heart that would respond to us. That though, Father, that you have our heart, Lord, but more but above that, Lord, we could have yours. We would have your heart living inside of us. That your spirit would guide us and direct us in all that we would do. that Father that as we would face the day, face the weak, face this evil age, Lord, that there would be a God of this evil age, there would be a raid against us, Lord. But by Father, by your word for this day, we could overcome, Lord, you would be with us as we would depart as we the people would go forward throughout the week. You would be with us, watching over us and keeping us as we would dismiss from this service. Lord, we would never dismiss from your hand. never dismissed from your presence. We ask this your holy and precious name Jesus Christ. Amen. Let's sing and end this [music] lengthy service. I apologize. Oh, let's see. Keep singing that. Create in me a clean heart.
