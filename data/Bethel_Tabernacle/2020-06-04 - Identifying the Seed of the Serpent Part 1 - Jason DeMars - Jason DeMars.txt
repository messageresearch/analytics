TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning everyone may the lord richly bless you we are for those who are watching on facebook right now we had some technical issues so i'm going live right on my phone apologize it's not the same quality and sound quality but we're doing our best here so let's all stand and pray gracious heavenly father we just come to you lord and we're so thankful and so grateful for your goodness to us lord that regardless of the things that we go through in our lives and the difficulties and struggles and trials you're you're with us you promise to never leave us and never forsake us and lord this is where we get our confidence from this is where we get our joy from lord we just want to ask that your spirit would come and speak to our hearts and deal with us lord help me to get out of the way and may your word come forth to every heart we ask these things in jesus name amen god bless you can be seated we're going to start a new a new series may just be a few uh probably just two two sessions but it's gonna be on serpent seed identifying the seed of the serpent so we have this i kind of want to present it and look at it with fresh eyes not necessarily looking at it like well we believe this you know for 30 years 40 years but look at it with fresh eyes from the scriptures in a way that somebody knew could hear and receive it so we have this strange story in the book of genesis about trees that can give eternal life or death a talking snake and so it it's so different from the character of the rest of the bible it should cause us to pause for a second and say the rest of the bible is dealing with such real solid things now we have something that doesn't seem to fit you know magical trees and and and um talking snakes so uh that there's it should speak to us and say there's a mystery here that god wants to unfold to us but we need to look at the rest of the bible to see what's happening here genesis 1 26 through 27 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them so this is god's initial charge to mankind this is where it starts and we have verse 28 and god bless them god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth so god's commandment to adam and eve was to multiply themselves god so so first of all god made them in his image and likeness we understand the two parts of creation one in spirit form then one into flesh but what they were they what god wanted them to reproduce was his own life so god put his life into adam and eve first he made them in spirit form then he put him in the flesh he said i want you to reproduce my life in human flesh so in a multiplied fashion and so this is what god charged them to do so then we look at the rest of the context of the scriptures we shouldn't lose track of god's first commandment because because what does god always do when he gives a command to us a test follows when god says i'm i want you to do this immediately who meets you there satan meets you there that's allowed and purposed by god because he doesn't he wants our faith to be solid right and un an untested person will never reach maturity an untested person never really has faith genesis 1 11 and 12 a principle that god sets forth in scriptures and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree tree yielding fruit whose seed was itself after his kind and god saw that it was good two principles here one is all life is in the original all that life that comes after is in that original seed that god had made and that doesn't just mean for plant life that also means for animal life and that also means for human life so god to produce after it's kind he doesn't want it to produce a hybrid he wants the original life propagated genesis 2 9. okay so right right here we have god creating god saying reproduce and the next thing we say here in genesis 2 9 and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil if you are looking at this verse right away it should stop you and say okay what is going on here yeah amen trees that are good for food i get it trees that are beautiful to look at i understand that but now you're telling me a tree of life and a tree of knowledge of good and evil it should again it should cause us to pause and say what's being said here is are these literal trees is there a hidden mystery here that the rest of scripture would reveal to us what is this all about genesis 2 16-17 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eat us thereof thou shalt surely die so again is it seem in incongruity with the rest of the scripture so we here we have god say multiply and replenish the earth his his commandment is to do that and to take dominion next we see mystical trees put forward one that brings eternal life one that brings death and and then then we're here look at this is how does this fit in to the big picture of what god is painting in the first three chapters of genesis can they be literal trees revelation 2 7 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh while i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god so where is the tree of life so god god never said he destroyed the tree of life in the book of genesis and here we find the tree of life is still in existence amen right all right so here are we talking about a literal tree eating of a literal tree of life that's in the midst of god's paradise so it's still in the same spot so if we're talking about literal tree literal geogra you know in a literal place of geography no doubt garden of eden was a literal place adam and eve were literal people not not disputing that whatsoever but what i'm saying is if the tree of life is a literal actual tree and it still exists in the paradise of god we should be able to find it we should be able to go to the middle east and search and locate the tree of life and we can take it and and no doubt it's multiplied since then there's more of them that and we can eat this fruit and have eternal life so you see it's these things are not incongruity with god's plan and god's program they're figurative trees this is obviously a figure of speech how do we how do we have eternal life well first of all if you're predestinated seed you always had eternal life you're simply recognizing when you when you recognize the savior and him who he is and accept that sacrifice god enters to you as you're saved but we always we always were saved we always had a part of that life but that life is a gift it's given to us by almighty god and it's not from eating a literal fruit genesis 3 14-15 and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel so again god said multiply and replenish the earth god said don't eat of these trees then the serpent comes causes the woman to eat from that tree and the next thing you know is there's two offspring okay so the eight of the tree now we're talking about two offspring so what does it mean to each of the tree genesis 3 1-2 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil i wanna just back up there a second we were talking about that progression and i want to emphasize that before i continue on and talk about what this serpent was so again we have god's commandment in the beginning multiply replenish the earth then he says don't eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil they do that and then what's the results when god comes to curse the serpent he's talking about offspring then he goes and we'll read it shortly then he goes to the woman and he says i will multiply your pain in childbirth so there's there's there's multiple things that fit together in perfection and there's one thing that's a mystery which is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil the rest of it's actually really clear that there was two two offspring involved god's commandment was to multiply and replenish the earth god's cursing her uh uh birth process with pain and so then we have this part that doesn't seem to fit the tree of the knowledge of good and evil the whole picture points to this one thing and that that those trees are not literal trees god wasn't saying don't eat a literal fruit but that it was a figure of speech very clear so then we go to the serpent and you see you'll see all the pictures and children's story story bibles and all this and it's either some kind of red lizard or a snake with a couple of feet on it and it's all complete nonsense no basis no basis in reality i want to read to you what adam clark a tremendous bible commentator from the late 1800s wrote about this account in as he was unpacking what actually this serpent was he says that whatever the nakhosh was he stood at the head of all inferior animals for wisdom and understanding so what he's what he's saying there is that this word that we translate to english as serpent which to any casual reader a serpent means a snake but what he's saying is that this so this term nakash if you look at it it's translated in many different ways throughout the old testament it's not just translated snake sometimes its meaning is crocodile sometimes its meeting is is brass sometimes its meaning is uh like a medium in in other words like a like a witch or a wizard right sometimes its meaning is uh adultery sometimes its meaning is uh like handcuffs basically this is what they would say and so the word changes based on the context that it's used in and so you have to see what is what is being spoken of based on the context so we'll pick up from there that whatever this nakhas was he stood at the head of all inferior animals for wisdom and understanding that he walked erect for this is necessarily implied in his punishment on thy belly i.e on all fours shalt thou go that he was endued with the gift of speech for a conversation is here related between him and the woman that he was also endued with the gift of reason for we find him reasoning and disputing with eve that these things were common to this creature the woman no doubt having often seen him walk erect talk and reason and therefore she testifies no kind of surprise when he accosts her in the language related in the text and indeed from the manner in which this is introduced it appears to be only a part of a conversation that had passed between them on the occasion yeah god said etc so we see here a bible commentary he didn't he didn't believe in the serpent seed doctrine but here he's looking at this serpent and he's saying we're not talking about a snake we're talking about something that walked on two feet that had was the most intelligent of all the animals that was able to speak and not only was he able to speak he was able to reason and these were normal things for this serpent to do if it wasn't if it wasn't something that the serpent did and all of a sudden satan magically gave him the ability to speak which god can god has done that and satan could do that we're not saying that that's not possible what we're saying is that if that was the case eve would have been like what's happening i'm running this is not right yeah but it wasn't it was the norm they had conversations they spoke together and and this was an ongoing thing brother branham says in questions and answers number one in 1954 and the serpent was not a reptile the curse made him a reptile he was just like a man he walked upright he was with this woman out there and she committed this adultery and brought forth her first son which was cain the nature of his daddy we spoke about it before but i'll read it here in john 3 john 3 16 genesis 3 16 unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee the bible says an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth in other words the punishment is to be commensurate to the crime so she committed a sin with that part of the body and therefore god places a curse upon that part of the body how ridiculous could it be she eats a fruit then then god goes to the serpent and says i'm gonna put a curse between your offspring and the woman's offspring and they're going what's he done what does he mean and then he says to the woman i'm going to increase your sorrow in childbearing hey i just ate an apple you're going gonna make me have pain when i give birth that's not fair god is just god is righteous god is holy he doesn't just change subjects all of a sudden from eating fruit he could have said they're in pain you will eat fruit and you'll have a toothache and you're you'll have stomach pains right when you eat this fruit he did he didn't say that he punished exactly this with the sin that they committed amen so god's command is to multiply and replenish the earth i know i'm repeating but that's part teaching you repeat repeat repeat god's command is to multiply and replenish the earth then god commands them not to eat from the tree of knowledge then god's putting in betw enmity between two genetic lines then god curses the birth process and puts eve's desire towards her husband so what does that have to do with eating fruit your desire will be to your husband well you desired that apple so now i'm going to have you desire your husband instead your desire went away from your husband now i'm putting your desire towards your husband it's simple second corinthians 11 2 and 3 for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtility so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ for if he that cometh preaches another jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted he you might well bear with him so let's go through this first the church is engaged as a verge don't read ahead church is engaged as a virgin to christ and he likens this to eve being engaged to as a virgin to adam but paul fears lest the church by adultery commits adultery by accepting a false word so he compares then he compares that to the original sin so if paul fears the church committing adultery and commit commits compares here it's assumed right there that people the people would understand that the original sin was adultery and not eating an apple proverbs 30 verse 20 such as the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith i have done no wickedness straight strange thing to say if you don't understand the original sin if you see what happened in the garden he likens that act of adultery unto eating song of solomon 4 12 a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a bring a spring shut up a fountain sealed away go northwind and come blow upon my garden that the spices thereof may flow out let my beloved come to his garden and eat his pleasant fruits i am come into my garden my sister my spouse i've gathered my myrrh with my spice i've eaten my honeycomb with my honey i have drunk my wine with my milk eat oh friends drink yeah drink abundantly oh beloved i'm not gonna offer any commentary on that i think you can read exactly what it's saying and it's likening those things unto eating so let's just uh bring it to a close there we stand and pray gracious father we love you and we're so thankful for a clear word in this hour lord for the revelation that you have brought to us to make known these mysteries of the scripture lord not to make us great wise and intelligent people lord but to make us more like jesus christ he said it's through you the revelation of yourself and your plan lord that you transform us lord as our mind is renewed that we've become more and more a reflection of jesus christ we ask your blessing upon each one we ask your blessing upon the service today lord be with brother aaron lord speak speak through and bless the the worship just move in a mighty way
