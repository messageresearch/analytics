========================================

all right good morning everybody let's all stand and have a word of prayer oh gracious father Lord we come together more than just two or three in this house father gathered in your name and so Lord we're inviting you and we we know that you always come when you're invited so father Lord we ask you would come down and bless the few words that I have Lord that father that you could speak through me that I it wouldn't just be me producing some words or some ideas that I would have but Lord that it would be you speaking through me father that I'd be able to step out of the way and put aside any any feeling that I would have any any nervousness or or or some idea or some some interpretation that I would have but father that it would be you speaking only what you would have said father that the people people's hearts would be open they could they could not simply have some dead letter on a page but Lord that it would become real to them that they could take it and live it and that become a a manifested word so father we we know that it is your will to do all of these things and we ask them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen um so I want to this morning Take A Part Two to to last week for those of you who were here um I'll do a for those of you who weren't or for those of you here who are here don't quite remember um I'm going to do a quick a quick summary of um of some of the points that I made last time and um before we do that we'll go ahead and read a scripture so youall can be seated um let's turn to Jeremiah chapter 2 and um if I can it is and we'll start at verse one and I'll wait for I have the benefit of having everything already saved on a device um it says um Jeremiah chapter 2 and verse one says moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem saying thus sayith the Lord I remember Thee the kindness of thy youth the love of thine espousals when thou wentest after me in the wilderness in a land that was not sown Israel was Holiness unto the Lord and the first fruits of his increase all that devour him shall offend evil shall come upon them sayith the Lord and we'll we'll be seated so I'm want to try to very quickly summarize um last week um and I'm just going to read a couple a couple things I had written down in my notes that kind of summarized um uh what we had said so to start with um to I I said to sort of if we could encapsulate the entire message of the hour of today uh we could say it like this perhaps um that the message of this hour is that God has come again to the Earth in human form and he looks like us right that that it would be God the Holy Spirit descending on people remaining in them and operating through them that their nature would be changed and that would be God living through them and and because they have the nature of God they would do the works of God right they would they would live like God would live they would do what God would do um and um I there's a you know we showed a sort of a type of how Jesus had you know the Holy Ghost descends on Jesus in the form of a dove at the River Jordan and now and that you know he he being perfect that the Holy Ghost descended and remained upon him and then when he dies that the Holy Ghost ascends to heaven and then descends again on the day of Pentecost onto the people amen and that once it descends upon the people then they start to doing the same works that Jesus did when he was on the earth to that and so that indicates that the same Jesus was alive again in them okay and that the same holy ghost that was alive and and working through the PE the the church at Pentecost was the same Holy Ghost working through William brandham here on Earth again because he's doing the exact same works again it's an indication of of the same life right and that to take it a step farther you know I I want to articulate it like this maybe that you know there's Christ the man and there's the Holy Ghost kind of on top of that um and brother brand talks about Jesus at at the tomb that he would cry and that that that when he would cry that would be a man but when he said Lazarus come forth that would be more than a man right um again you have say I I would kind of maybe take a different angle on it um that when Jesus goes to a well in Samaria and he's asking for a drink because he's thirsty he's that's the man asking for a drink but when he tells the woman at the well everything that she had done that was more than a man right when William brandom is depressed and is having because his wife and baby died and he's having a mental breakdown and ready to blow his brains out that's William brandom the man but when he turns his back on a crowd and starts telling people the things that he had done that he' never met before that's not a man that's more than a man right and to take it a step further the things that happen in my life you know you know if we leave the Holy Ghost on brother Brandon and we're missing what's happening in our day I personally have experienced where it's not just William brand telling people the things they had done I've met God in the back room of this very building in which Jason Watkins told me the things that I had done in a conversation that he was had no part of that IID had the day before and I met God and it wasn't because of Jason Watkins I mean I'm sure our pastors has faults and failures just like everybody else things he's not proud of but when he told me direct quotations from a conversation that i' had the day before that he had no part of that was more than a man right anytime you have a minister standing in the Pulpit telling you know preaching the word and the word begins to deal with things that you you know that preacher has no idea what he's what he's saying and yet he's saying exactly what you needed to hear that's not just a man standing there okay that's more than a man so uh to take it a step further says um but the again this is from last week that anytime you have a holy the Holy Spirit on the scene you have the devil presenting a counterfeit right it'll look so close that it'll deceive the very that it would deceive the very elect if that were possible but it it would look it would look close it would even be able to identify itself with the message yah looked at Cain how he would even name his own children Enoch as a as a as a as a a mimic of the true of of the actual Son of God named Enoch right there was a genuine Son of God named Enoch and the devil the this the serpent seed would would would try to identify himself with the raptured church for their for his day right um and but the the true Mark of the false seed of that serpent seed that Antichrist seed is that it can't be corrected that that it would where it would come off the word of God when when there would become a a a a conflict between the word of God and the desires of your heart if you're not willing to come under the correction of the word of God that's the Antichrist Spirit right um and so we moved on into um uh into Esther and it and we we talked about um Esther under the the ministry of Hagi teaching her to please the king in what she would do right and that there we had a Hagi in our day dressing the bride of Christ to meet her groom um and it says um I just wrote here it says if the true bride of Christ do only that which pleases the father because she has the nature of Christ in her the question becomes apparent how can we know what pleases the father God always sends his will for each age by the mouth of a single messenger so that the people can avoid confusion and ignorance Esther pleased the King by following the instructions of hagi hagi was the mouthpiece of the king to the women to instruct them on what pleased the king it says when he gave instruction to the women it was not simply his opinion or an educated guest he was the mouthpiece of the king there to convey the desires of the king to the women to disregard his teachings is simply an opinion showed that they could not be conformed to the will of the king because of their pride amen okay to ignore his teachings showed that they were made of the same material as vashy who also refused the word of the king that had come to her at the mouth of the king's seven chamberlains okay and that ultimately that all the women es Esther and all the other women who were going before the king all had a sensation they might have all jumped and shouted at a Revival meeting they might have all they all came under the same sanctification process they might have all been under the same Ministry of the same Messenger right that even even people under the under the ministry of William brandom can all at some point choose to disregard the teachings of that messenger in order to please their own desires and ultimately be rejected okay and so that's that's kind of where we where we ended so um man I am the worst about taking a a summary and making it way too long um so it says I want to so I want to start here in Jeremiah chapter 2 so with all this in mind I want to just take one key point one key takeaway that I want to really highlight is that there there was these PE these women in in in the Book of Esther where they're all looking to have receive something from the King they're all looking to be the king's bride they were all under the same sanctification they might have all cleaned their life up in a similar way they might have all been under the same Ministry they all had an experience with the king in a fa a to a fashion right they all met the king at some point and they all had some sort of relationship there but the king only stayed with one in particular and that was the one that anytime that the king's desires came in contrast to her desires she turned aside from what she wanted and did only that which the king wanted okay and ultimately that it was that it was the it was where the king remained right that that you could have an experience and not actually have God okay so I want to start here in Jeremiah chapter 2 and it says um you know where we read there says um go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem saying thus sayith the Lord I remember Thee the kindness of thy youth the love of thy espousals when thou wentest after me in the wilderness in a land that was not sown Israel's Holiness under the Lord and the first fruits of his increase all that devour him shall offend evil shall come unto them sayeth the Lord hear ye the word of the Lord oh House of Jacob and all the families of the House of Israel thus saith oh actually hang on I'm going I want to back up and and put some emphasis on this so it says hear ye the word of the Lord oh House of Jacob and all the families of the House of Israel okay so I want to emphasize here that it's speaking directly to the families okay that this is a family level thing this is not a nationwide problem this is a on the level of individual households okay because a nation is made up of families and likewise a church is made up of individual families okay and ultimately the family is made up of individuals so each individual is contributing to that family and likewise the family contributes to a church if if individual families no longer hold to the word of God then ultimately the entire church falls apart the entire church is no longer holding the word of God it really boils down to don't sit around waiting for another person or another family or another people in other people in your church to rise higher the solution is that you rise higher yourself take on of yourself you do that which you need to do and when everybody gets on that same page gets in that one mind in that Accord then you'll see Revival okay um it says um so it's but it's so it's to individual families it says thus sayith the Lord what iniquity have your fathers found in me that they are gone far from me and have walked after vanity and be are become vain okay so this is to fathers this is to dads and husbands okay this is to heads of households amen and it says um to walk after vanity and or become vain that word vanity would maybe more translate into more contemporary English as worthless that you have walked after worthlessness and are become worthless okay that it's just you you you're seeking after that the heads of households are seeking after worthless nonsense worthless entertainment worthless this worthless that I I I believe it was yesterday um the trying to remember off the top of my head um I we I read the evening devotional from Spurgeon and he's so beautifully put that so often times we think of vanity as you know in in back in those times maybe like you know uh entertainment to to see some some play or some some stage show or hear some music or something like that we see that oh that's just worthlessness that's vanity right right he said but anything that is not putting God first is Vanity and he said you can be uh you know sort of again to sort of paraphrase what he said it for more contemporary English that don't think of worthlessness as Simply Basic entertainment but you can be just as worthless at the bank as you can at the at the at a Broadway show am right you can be just as as worthless in your business Affairs as you can a at a theater if you're not putting God first in that okay ultimately God is your provider and so if you're leaning to the arm of the Flesh and thinking that what you do in your business is what ultimately what's is what's going to keep you then that's that's vanity that's just as worthless as wasting your time on anything okay um it says uh walked after vanity and it become vain verse six it says neither said they where is the Lord that brought us out of the land of Egypt that led us through the Wilderness through a land of deserts and pits through a land of drought and of the shadow of death through a land that no man passed through and where no man dwelt and so here was Israel completely ignorant of the fact that God had left them and they didn't care okay that the spirit of God had left there was no movement of the spirit you know they they would go to their church services go to their their their their offerings go to the go meet at the synagogue and God was not there and they didn't know it and didn't care it just just completely ignorant of the fact that God was no longer with them and nobody bothered to ask right and it says um verse 6 and I brought you out of a plentiful country to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof but when ye entered ye defiled my land and made my inheritage and Abomination the priest said not where is the Lord and they that handle the law knew me not the pastors also transgressed against me and the prophets prophesied by Baal and walked after things do not profit so even the ministry ultimately what this is the is laid at the feet of the ministry first but and that's true in this day we it is weakness in the pull pit that will ultimately cause weakness in the church right failure of leadership and I I'll if Lord willing and I have the time I'll get into get into that a little bit but I don't want us to just throw this that particular verse off onto the ministry Revelations 1:6 clearly indicates that we are all high priests before God right how many times we say that women are the pastors of their of the children in their home right this is not just something to be thrown off onto the pulpit it's for every everyone every lay person to recognize this is something that I can do okay this is this is this is to you know brother bandam has the has the story of the of the young the man who's dying and the little boy tells him you know put your name in the in in Isaiah 53 right well put your name in Jeremiah chapter 2 once right put put put it there recognize where you're not holding up lining up to the word of God and conform right and and just ask yourself put your look yourself in the mirror says um I'm going to I'm going to have to just get some of this for the sake of time it says ultimately I want to get to verse uh 13 and it says for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Water and hewed them out sists broken sisters that can hold no water okay the first portion of this is that so I find this interesting that they they have two sins here right that the first sin is that they rejected the Fountain of Living Water right which is an interesting point to me especially to Israel where one of their key founding fundamental moments is when they're in the desert and the rock is smitten and the the Fountain of loading water comes forth right we know Christ is that Christ is that Rock and we know that in the Bible anytime you're talking about water especially Living Water this is a type of the Holy Spirit and so here it is earlier in the chapter they're talking about no one's asking where's the where's the Holy Spirit no one's asking where's where's God moving in our in our midst and it's because they had rejected the source of the Holy Spirit they rejected God they they they didn't want him in their in their uh in their lives and the second thing that they did is that they had hewed out cisterns okay so if anybody knows what a sistern is it's a man-made structure it's a tank right some of you from out west or around cattle might know what a stock tank is very similar concept it's just a big hole in the ground or a big tank that when the rain comes they run all the rain water off into that tank and it collects water and then they pull your water out of that now anyone's ever seen a a sistern nobody in their right mind is drinking out of that thing it is stagnant it sits there it accumulates especially around here if y'all ever seen a tank full of water sit around open to the air out in buurt you know it gets full of nastiness real quick right it's full of pollution it gets full of bugs and and lizards and and and frogs and all the birds get in it and it's full of nastiness and germs and scum grows on it and it's gross okay and not only that but it's a broken sistern it's busted it doesn't even hold the water that it collects for very long and so it's it's so here we have this this this type where you have people who rather than having the Holy Spirit operating through them on a regular basis constantly renewing them constantly flowing out instead they would rather have this this man-made structure this this uh satanic substitute that'll excuse me make them think well it's sort of like having a fountain of water it's sort of like a holy ghost experience it's got some holy ghost in it but it's polluted it's full of Filth it doesn't actually clean up anything right you know you look at a fountain like a a real true genuine like artisian well of fresh spring of water where that water's coming out there ain't nothing growing there like no and I mean like no bacteria no no no no um uh pollution there's no because it's constantly washing all the that stuff away not only that but you know you don't you end up with frogs and lizards and things living in that stagnant water because it's full of things that they eat they eat the scum they eat the filth right and you have people who they reject the pure word of God because they like to eat the filth right they want that broken sistern they want that sistern they can't stand to have the word of God constantly washing that stuff away cuz then it it it cramps their lifestyle right it you know you can't man I am out of time quick um you know they they people don't want to listen to the The Fountain Of God wash away their sins when you know I I got a couple minutes left and I just I just got something I want to couple quotes I want to read so this is from I'm just going to very quickly read a couple of these because I I just feel like I I'm I'm so burdened to say this says um this is from handwriting on the wall it says he says it used to be wrong for Holiness women to wear pain on their face and now they just gobb it on anyway and sing and shout and praise the Lord like there was nothing to it okay y'all can just take that with no context okay I think the context is pretty clear says what a disgrace women sing in the choir with bobbed hair and the Bible said she's an unhonorable person paint on their face there was only one woman who ever painted her face in the Bible that was Jezebel God fet the dogs so you see what he thinks about it and when you come tell them about it next year come back they're worse than they was in the first place irreverent they have no respect no thoughts of decency and he says and he skips down because he he says makes a statement then he tells a story about how another Minister told him that he should stop beating up the people right not stop preaching this stuff and he says look brother brandom said why then people believe you to be a prophet I said I never said that I said I was did I he said but they believe you to be why don't you teach them women how to receive the Holy Ghost and how to receive gifts and do something instead of always Bing them out about the way they're dressing and what they're doing why don't you teach them the kind of things to help it I said said how can I teach them algebra when they won't learn their ABCs you know what ABC is always believe Christ that's right so here he is talking about he he'll preach Holiness because how can God move through you how can the Holy Spirit move through you if you're not holy to begin with right all you're going to do is end up polluting the fresh word of God the fresh water of the Holy Spirit moving through you with bugs and snakes and everything else okay amen all right moving on it says Can You Feel The Holy scream holy Spirit screaming out from you oh United States and the world how often I would have gathered you but you would not now your hour has come and your God of Pleasure your god of Filth your Sodom and Gomorrah God Has Come among you even our little kids Beetle haircuts and bangs across their face and little perverts starting out our women is gone it's beyond Redemption our men has become big sissies walk with little short pants on and acting like a girl and hair hanging down their necks and we are sodomites and the fire and the wrath of God Waits For Us ouch okay by the way do yourself a favor once and Google what the Beatles looked like in the 1960s cuz he said he refers specifically to the Be Beatles haircut as a homosexual Spirit over and over and over again it's not something to play with all right there was you know and he mentioned he mentions short pants I'm going to paraphrase what he said it used to be wrong in a message church for men to wear P wear wear shorts it used to be that way I don't I mean it still is thank you brother Luther it still is I'm sorry I don't care what you're doing brother brandham said that it was it was to for a man to pair put on a pair of shorts was as if he was putting on a pair of women's underwear I I don't I mean I don't know it's just we can make all kinds of excuses but men please explain to me what is the context in which you would put on a pair of women's underwear and that's the context you can put on a pair of shorts okay it says and American people want to be entertained they stay home on Wednesday night to see who loves Susi or ever whatever that program is that shows what's in your heart if you love God you'd be at church you've got to get back to the church back to the Bible back to Christ all right make the excuses you want if you are not at the house of God I don't know what a good excuse for that is okay I understand people get an ox in the ditch I understand there there instances which people just have absolute catastrophes where you literally cannot make it to the house of God people get sick you have problems but if this is a recurring theme where you haven't been to church in 6 months or a month or however long where you can make every excuse in the world and or or even just not to show up on time how about that how about the how many quotes does brother bandam say that if you want to have the spirit of God move in the church show up early get into get in the spirit first don't wait for the song leader to come get you into the spirit get there 30 minutes early pray repent clean your heart out consecrate yourself to God before the song even starts okay because it shows that people don't actually have a desire for the word of God they're just showing up for an obligation just so they can show their face so they don't have somebody calling them to wonder where they're at you know they can they can just sort of appease their conscience maybe not actually interested in the spirit of God moving because if it did it would wash away all that carnality that they've got going on says um man I'm like out of time so I'm G to I'm going to read this last quote and and we'll quit um says God knows we need more women like that he's talking about zachus his wife praying for her husband who was not serving God yeah and he he pray she prayed for him constantly that he could uh meet Jesus and and and become a Christian says God knows we need more women like that today when Womanhood is broke the backbone of the nation is broke when women get get to a place that our American women are today is a disgrace the way our American women act I got a clipping out of the paper that I believe it was about 60% of the boys that went overseas in this last war was divorced from their wives before they came back their wives running off with somebody else in these defense plants working she has got no business in a defense plant a woman's place is at home with her children and when she now if her husband's sick and she has to work that's different but women's place is at home in the kitchen and when she leaves when she leaves that she's out of her place exactly right ouch right these things matter this is the instruction of Hagi our instructor and if we want to disregard it and say well that's just his opinion that's just an old-fashioned way of thinking that's just some sort of fanaticism well frankly when it comes to making a Rapture I'm a bit of a fanatic okay when it comes to displeasing God I'm a bit of a fanatic you know when it comes to making sure that my life is 100% in line with the word of God I am a fanatic we have you know that you know people have no problem calling themselves a sports fan or a fan of whatever entertainment they want to come up with right I'm for I'm I'm a fan of this team I'm a fan of that team I'm a fan of this musician I'm a fan of that movie star I'm a fan of this whatever well the term fan is just short for fanatic so we'll happily call ourselves a fanatic for the Dallas Cowboys or happily call ourselves a golf fanatic or or or a a hunting fanatic or whatever happily do that happily call ourselves a fanatic for whatever for whatever you know music that we want to come up with whatever new movies coming out whatever TV show we want to watch but try to be a ftic for the word of God once I mean it's it's hard but friends is ain't no time to play am anyways that's let's stand and pray before I get off the rails here gracious father Lord we thank you for this opportunity to bring your word the people father I I know it's hard sometimes father I you know that I've only ever said anything cuz I wanted to help people and God if I said anything that would hurt people or would be too harsh Lord that you would you would soothe it over lord and you would make sure the people understand that it's only for their good and Lord if there would be anybody who would be calling after you father that you would help them come to your word Lord that anything that that people would be offer the mark Lord that you would reveal to where they're wrong and that they would have the the heart to seek after you father amen father we ask that you would be with us through the reing of the service that they would be with the the hearts would be open and and longing for your word as the musicians come and and and lead the worship Lord and that ultimately the greatest form of worship is the hearing of your word we long for your for your word and long for what you have for us we ask these things and pray this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
