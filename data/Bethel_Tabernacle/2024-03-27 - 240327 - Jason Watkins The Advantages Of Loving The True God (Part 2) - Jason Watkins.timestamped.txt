[24:47] message

[25:05] tonight hopefully the Lord will allow me
[25:07] to get to it all amen I've had it on my
[25:10] heart to carry on with that thought uh
[25:14] since I preached it I knew I only got
[25:15] about halfway down amen so uh I figured
[25:19] I owed the Lord another shot at it amen
[25:22] praise the Lord and so I actually um
[25:26] pushed brother Mattis out he owes us
[25:28] part two to last Wednesday so uh we'll
[25:31] be looking forward to that amen amen but

[25:44] all in one piece amen and there's a lot
[25:47] to report we've been getting little
[25:48] Snippets of it and so the Lord is doing
[25:51] some tremendous tremendous things um
[25:55] right right away it's it's happening in
[25:57] real time so I just think we're close to
[26:00] home friends I just believe that with
[26:02] all my heart it's very exciting uh to be
[26:05] a believer uh at this hour Sarah good to
[26:09] see you here God bless you amen Luke
[26:12] chapter 1 and we're going to read verses
[26:15] 26 through through 38 a little bit
[26:18] lengthy it's very familiar to us you've
[26:21] been reading this since the days when
[26:22] you were in Sunday school Luke 1:
[26:27] 26-38 and in the sixth month the angel
[26:30] Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of
[26:34] Galilee Nam uh named Nazareth to a
[26:38] virgin espoused to a man whose name was
[26:41] Joseph of the House of David and the
[26:44] virgin's name was Mary and the angel
[26:47] came in unto her and said hail Thou Art
[26:50] highly favored the Lord is with thee
[26:54] blessed art thou among women when she
[26:57] saw him she was troubled at this saying
[27:00] and cast in her mind what manner of
[27:03] salutation this should be the angel said
[27:06] unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast
[27:09] found favor with God so this is this is
[27:13] a point that the angel really wants her
[27:17] to absorb you are highly favored you
[27:21] have found favor now she's going to need
[27:24] to believe
[27:26] that for what's coming coming cuz she's
[27:29] about to hear something quite impossible
[27:32] but when you're highly favored and when
[27:35] you're doubly highly favored that's then
[27:38] all things are possible amen verse
[27:41] 31 and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy
[27:44] womb and bring forth a son shall call
[27:47] his name Jesus he shall be great and he
[27:50] shall be called the son of the highest
[27:52] and the Lord God shall give unto him the
[27:55] Throne of his father David and he shall
[27:58] reign over the house of Jacob forever
[28:01] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[28:05] then said Mary unto the angel how shall
[28:08] this be seeing I know not a man and the
[28:12] angel answered and said unto her the
[28:15] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the
[28:18] power of the highest shall overshadow
[28:20] thee therefore also that Holy thing
[28:24] which shall be born of thee shall be
[28:26] called the son of God and behold thy
[28:29] cousin Elizabeth she hath also conceived
[28:32] a son in her old age and this is the
[28:35] sixth month with her who was called
[28:38] Baron for with God nothing shall be
[28:42] impossible and Mary said behold the
[28:45] handmade of the Lord be it unto me
[28:48] according to Thy word and the angel
[28:51] departed from her Mary as you know is a
[28:54] perfect uh type of the Bride of today
[28:59] you have all kinds of examples you can
[29:00] go back you can pick up Sarah you can
[29:03] pick up Rahab you can pick up Esther you
[29:06] can pick up Ruth but Mary is really
[29:09] where brother brandham brought it to for
[29:12] the Bride of the last day those other
[29:14] ones also type the bride in in various
[29:17] ways but this one here is the most
[29:19] poignant for us so we're going to look
[29:22] at it from this angle tonight let's
[29:25] pray father we thank you for your
[29:28] divinely revealed truths Lord we thank
[29:31] you for the hearing the reading and the
[29:33] hearing of your word read we thank you
[29:36] for your anointing throughout the the
[29:39] afternoon Lord as I co pondered Lord and
[29:42] thought about this thought and it's been
[29:44] on My Heart Lord to bring this second
[29:47] portion this second installment Lord it
[29:49] still Burns in my heart and I pray
[29:51] tonight that you'll give us hearing
[29:53] Hearts tonight to see and hear and
[29:56] understand all that you you are doing
[29:59] and accomplishing in this hour we commit
[30:02] ourselves into your hands for service in
[30:04] Jesus name amen God bless you as you're
[30:16] seated we found out last time and I just
[30:19] want to take a few minutes and just
[30:22] bring back to your memory some of the
[30:24] points that we made last time we found a
[30:27] great advant AG uh of loving a true God
[30:31] and and the and a and even a as if it
[30:34] were icing on the cake or the cherry on
[30:37] top having that true God love you back
[30:41] and in fact is we found out that he in
[30:44] fact first loved us and he loved us in a
[30:48] in a rather um a rather amazing way when
[30:52] we were pretty much unlovable and when
[30:55] we were lost and we were undone and we
[30:58] had no chance and we were on our way to
[31:00] hell and there was nothing we could do
[31:02] about it God loved us during that time
[31:06] and we found out that in our opening
[31:08] text last time we read from Proverbs 3
[31:11] and we found out that that if we will
[31:13] but acknowledge God in all of our ways
[31:17] then he would direct our paths now you
[31:20] know there there's you know there's
[31:21] there's friends and then there's real
[31:23] friends there's friends that are friends
[31:26] in the good times and in the bad AB
[31:28] times they're friends not just fair
[31:30] weather friends but they are friends
[31:32] forever and they have your best interest
[31:36] and a real friend will always tell you
[31:38] the truth that's a real friend a real
[31:40] friend won't just um try to butter you
[31:44] up for Advantage but a real friend is
[31:47] somebody that'll that you can count on
[31:49] to walk with you down the paths of life
[31:52] and tonight you know we're talking about
[31:56] not just any friend but I want to give
[31:58] you this phrase tonight that if we have
[32:01] a friend in Jesus and that being the
[32:04] case is he your
[32:06] friend then good news you have a Divine
[32:10] friend now it's one thing to have a
[32:12] human friend it'd be one thing to have a
[32:14] rich human friend it'd be one thing to
[32:16] have a powerful human friend but if you
[32:18] have a Divine friend you have somebody
[32:21] with more riches and more power than can
[32:24] be measured he is a Divine friend and a
[32:28] friend indeed he's willing to direct our
[32:31] paths these are some of the advantages
[32:34] that we looked at last time there's we
[32:37] found that there's Great Value the Bible
[32:40] talks about where we read in James 2 how
[32:43] that Abraham believed God and he was
[32:46] called the friend of God we found the
[32:50] Great Value in knowing Christ as a close
[32:54] friend we found out that that he had
[32:57] commissioned IED you know his family he
[33:00] commissioned Abram he commissioned
[33:02] Joshua he's he's he's good about
[33:05] commissioning his family and he said to
[33:08] Abraham now just look in every direction
[33:11] and I want you to walk through the land
[33:13] Abraham because everywhere you walk I'm
[33:16] going to give it to you he said to
[33:19] Joshua you know uh your footsteps
[33:22] everywhere you put your footstep he'
[33:24] said it to Moses he said it to Joshua he
[33:27] has said to you a night and night a
[33:29] prophet picked it up in this day and
[33:31] said footsteps mean possession you know
[33:34] it'd be one thing to have a really uh
[33:38] powerful human friend you might have a
[33:40] politically connected friend you might
[33:42] have a financially connected friend but
[33:45] I will assure you that none of those
[33:49] friends can give you eternal life
[33:52] there's only one friend that can do that
[33:55] and in order to get eternal life your
[33:57] friend has to be a Divine friend because
[34:00] there's only one form of eternal life
[34:02] and that's God's life and that's Divine
[34:04] Life and so it's one thing for somebody
[34:07] to say to me hey here's some acreage and
[34:10] everywhere you walk I'm going to give it
[34:12] to you well and fine okay thank you but
[34:15] it's going to Ash and Cinder in the
[34:17] tribulation period it ain't going to do
[34:19] me a lot of good then I'd like to have a
[34:22] land that's given to me that can never
[34:25] perish that no one can ever take it away
[34:27] away from me and that here's the
[34:29] beautiful part all I had to do was give
[34:33] him control of my life and he promise to
[34:36] lead me and guide me to that reward amen
[34:41] everywhere that I would walk would be my
[34:43] possession we found out last time that
[34:47] he you know the the the requirement
[34:49] would be that we would keep our lives
[34:52] free from the things of the world we
[34:54] found out that it's to keep ourselves
[34:56] free from anything and this is good
[34:59] advice for you tonight it's good advice
[35:02] for you tomorrow it' be good advice for
[35:04] your family be good advice for their
[35:06] family who aren't even arrived in the
[35:08] earth yet go ahead and put this in your
[35:12] tool bag that if you want to give your
[35:15] loved ones advice that that is that has
[35:18] that has some value is tell them to keep
[35:21] their lives free from anything that is
[35:25] not the tree of life amen
[35:28] we live in the world we make use of the
[35:31] world but we we showed you last time how
[35:34] that while it is that we use the world
[35:37] we don't use it as abusing it as Paul
[35:40] taught the Corinthian Church in 1
[35:42] Corinthians 7 he said in one as those
[35:46] who deal with the world as though they
[35:48] had no dealings with it now that that's
[35:51] an amazing way to say it he said in the
[35:53] in the KJV and they that use this world
[35:56] as not abusing it for the fashion of
[35:59] this world passes passees away there's
[36:03] no better advice that you can give your
[36:06] loved ones than to say don't chase this
[36:09] world because it's passing away set your
[36:13] affections on things above there's no
[36:15] better counsel you can give your
[36:17] children but I'm here to tell you
[36:19] parents if they don't see those words in
[36:22] your life those words will ring
[36:25] hollowed so we we find then that the the
[36:29] whis translation had said those who are
[36:31] making use of this world as not making
[36:35] excessive use of it for the temporary
[36:37] fashion of the world is passing
[36:40] away colossian Church set their
[36:43] affections on things above and not on
[36:46] things of the earth and we found out
[36:48] things like you know we here here's
[36:51] something that that really meant a lot
[36:52] to me last time and we find that God's
[36:57] guidance and wisdom is offered to us
[37:01] that we are told by Solomon to trust in
[37:03] the Lord with all your heart don't lean
[37:07] to your own understanding and all your
[37:09] ways submit to him say what will I get
[37:12] here's the beauty you're going to get
[37:14] something you ready he will make your
[37:16] path
[37:18] straight now that's good since straight
[37:21] is the gate and narrow is the way that
[37:23] leadth to life I need somebody to make
[37:25] my path straight
[37:28] Hallelujah we found out that he's unlike
[37:31] these arrogant monarchs of History he
[37:33] doesn't need he's not on some Power Trip
[37:36] he actually is he's he's he loves a
[37:39] contrite heart he loves love he loves
[37:42] Faith he loves his family and we found
[37:46] out that Jesus has a very generous
[37:48] Spirit but here was something that we
[37:51] cautioned you of last time and and I
[37:54] used you know my own self as a as a as a
[37:57] kind of
[37:58] in contary distinction to God he's not a
[38:01] doie
[38:03] grandpa so you know the the thing you
[38:06] know ad doie grandpa will sometimes give
[38:09] grandchildren things that aren't
[38:11] necessarily good for them things that
[38:13] are give them cavities and things
[38:14] that'll spoil them and things that'll
[38:16] make it hard on Mom and Dad but things
[38:19] that don't that'll you know give them
[38:21] the wrong idea about life being a free
[38:23] ride it's not a free ride I'm glad that
[38:26] Christ is very generous in spirit but we
[38:30] found out he still has a royal heart and
[38:34] he's not used to being dictated to he is
[38:36] a king your friend is a king see and so
[38:41] so we realize then that he he he he
[38:46] understands emotions this is what we
[38:48] discovered last time we reminded you not
[38:50] only does he understand your feelings
[38:53] sometimes we can get in a place where we
[38:55] think nobody understands us I'll promise
[38:58] you he does he understands feelings he
[39:03] understands emotions we said to you last
[39:05] time he invented
[39:08] them I'd say the inventor of emotions
[39:10] and feelings understands them he has
[39:14] supreme power we found out that it's in
[39:16] perfect control and this is what he has
[39:20] called you to if you want to be his
[39:21] friend then he he's calling you to give
[39:25] him control of your life so that he can
[39:27] make make your path straight so that he
[39:29] can leave you lead you from Darkness
[39:31] into light and so that so that you can
[39:34] actually be a partaker you're join AES
[39:38] uh with Christ you're Heirs of God but
[39:40] join AES with Christ see so we're
[39:43] partakers with him we found out that he
[39:46] is our refuge and our strength David
[39:48] said he knows listen this this was to me
[39:53] this was so beautiful last time when we
[39:56] read that Psalms 46 one of my favorite
[39:59] Psalms God is Not will be not may be God
[40:06] is our refuge and strength he's a very
[40:11] present very present help in time of
[40:14] trouble I want you to understand that he
[40:17] knows what Satan has done to you he
[40:20] knows that you were born in sin he knows
[40:23] that the devil has taken advantage of
[40:25] that he knows that God God is a loving
[40:28] God and he knows that Satan as Paul
[40:31] taught us in the Book of Romans that
[40:33] Satan used the law that was meant for
[40:36] our good and he manipulated it against
[40:39] us because we couldn't keep it and
[40:40] therefore he bound us and Paul said that
[40:43] which was supposed to be for my life was
[40:45] actually for my death I want you to know
[40:48] Jesus understands that I want you to
[40:51] know this Divine friend knows that Satan
[40:54] trapped you in in your birth he knows
[40:57] that Satan got you to do all kinds of
[40:59] things that tonight you'd say I regret
[41:01] those things I wish i' had never done
[41:03] them I'm here to tell you something
[41:05] friend God understands these things he
[41:09] understands how Satan has manipulated
[41:11] the world he Satan has seen to it has
[41:14] seen to it that the bride in the last
[41:17] day she has to live uh daily in a world
[41:21] that is so polluted and so filthy and so
[41:24] Godless and so vile but I want you to
[41:28] know you've got a friend in
[41:31] Jesus you've got a friend who cares and
[41:35] a friend who understands a friend you
[41:37] say but what about the devil and what
[41:39] about what I did and what about my
[41:41] weaknesses and what about my problems
[41:43] I'm here to tell you that because you
[41:45] got a Divine friend he takes every
[41:47] charge that the enemy brings against you
[41:50] and throws it out of his courtroom
[41:52] before Satan can even bring the charge
[41:55] my friend the judge toss it is the
[41:59] case my friend the
[42:02] judge won't hear
[42:05] it and it's already dismissed before the
[42:08] devil can even bring the
[42:10] charge this Divine friend is ready to
[42:13] save to the utmost that's where we
[42:16] finished last time that he's ready to
[42:18] save to the utmost he's ready to forgive
[42:21] and he's not only ready to forgive I
[42:23] want you to know this friend is ready to
[42:26] forget it
[42:28] he's not just here to forgive your sins
[42:30] he's here to forget your sins he's here
[42:32] to absolve it he's here to bring you
[42:36] back to a virgin condition because he
[42:38] only recognizes the image he saw of you

[51:18] to strengthen you so I say to you
[51:21] tonight don't let them weaken you cuz
[51:25] that's the devil the devil likes to use
[51:27] trials to weaken you that's not why God
[51:29] sends them if you want a test fail
[51:33] one you want to you want to get a test
[51:36] from the Lord fail one I promise you
[51:39] you'll take that test again and again
[51:42] and again until you pass it you got a
[51:46] faithful
[51:50] friend he doesn't want you to live in
[51:52] weakness although at times and for
[51:54] certain seasons and for his own reason
[51:56] he may allow you to be weak at times
[51:59] it's so that he can be made strong
[52:01] generally his eternal plan just
[52:03] understand no matter what the devil
[52:05] tries to whisper to you his eternal plan
[52:06] is that you be in health and
[52:08] prosper brother Brandon there there
[52:11] direct quotes you know I I remember as a
[52:13] young Minister and this maybe this will
[52:14] help the young Ministry team you know
[52:17] when I first started preaching I was I
[52:19] had a concern a needless concern I
[52:22] didn't need to worry about it and the
[52:23] Lord straightened me out and I never
[52:24] worried about it again and I always
[52:27] worried about you know the whole whole
[52:29] thing about you know I'd heard brother
[52:31] brandham say you know you got to be
[52:32] careful he's talking about his office as
[52:33] a prophet and that Authority that the
[52:35] angel said if you if you get them to
[52:37] believe nothing will stand before your
[52:39] prayers and and brother brandham got in
[52:41] trouble with that because he said he
[52:44] said I he would actually stop the prayer
[52:46] line and if he had a devil that was
[52:48] resistant and he wouldn't let that
[52:50] person pass until he healed him he said
[52:51] I KN I knew the strength of the promise
[52:53] the angel had made me and the angel
[52:56] correct Ed him on that and brother Bram
[52:57] admits it on tape don't throw something
[52:59] at me he admits it on tape and he said
[53:02] he pointed out to me he said you're
[53:04] doing something in your services in your
[53:07] meetings that the Lord Jesus didn't do
[53:09] in his Earthly
[53:11] Ministry said he walked into a to a to
[53:14] the to the pool and healed one man and
[53:16] left everybody else said the son does
[53:18] nothing but what he sees the father
[53:20] doing first and brother brandham said I
[53:22] made up my mind right then and there he
[53:23] said I would pray for everybody but I
[53:26] would let Jesus decide who he was going
[53:28] to
[53:30] heal and so you know he say you know you
[53:32] got to be careful with that kind of a an
[53:34] anointing and that kind of power and he
[53:36] said somebody come along and God's got a
[53:38] curse on them and you take it off said
[53:40] you get in trouble with God and you
[53:41] cause the pro the the the problem to be
[53:44] worse and so I you know I had all of
[53:46] this all these Shadows oh my goodness
[53:47] what do I do you know and I'm just just
[53:49] you know Mis understanding how brother
[53:51] Brandon was explaining it all about his
[53:53] own Ministry and the things that he had
[53:54] to learn and I realized one day you know
[53:56] the Lord just spoke to me in my heart
[53:57] and I said Lord I you know is it what
[53:59] what if I'm praying for somebody it's
[54:00] not your will to heal them but yet I
[54:02] would find quoes where brother Bron
[54:04] would say he would say now you see all
[54:06] those people lined up on that wall
[54:08] they're they they had them lined up down
[54:10] the wall sometimes they'd be lined out
[54:11] the door and down blocks and he said
[54:14] they're coming through the line to be
[54:15] prayed for and brother Brandon would say
[54:17] on tape he said I'm just as sure that
[54:19] it's God's will to heal every last one
[54:21] of them as anything see because it's
[54:24] always his will but but all but a lot of
[54:27] times his will works through folds of
[54:30] his purpose and he has to bring a
[54:32] certain purpose in your life and he h he
[54:35] knows the future he's all powerful he's
[54:38] all wise I promise you you can just put
[54:41] your life in his
[54:42] hands I promise you you can just put
[54:45] your life you can just close your eyes
[54:47] and just walk forward and say Lord take
[54:50] my hand lead me on Hallelujah You' got a
[54:55] friend in Jesus
[54:58] and I realized you know the Lord said
[55:00] you know and and suddenly that begun
[55:02] began to be so clear to me and I thought
[55:04] lord it's not up to me to decide who's

[56:49] just going to overrule it you understand
[56:53] so so he beckons to you he calls to you
[56:56] that's what he did to Israel when Israel
[56:58] ended up out in the wilderness and he
[56:59] found her sitting in her own blood and
[57:01] she was half dead and and he said he
[57:04] said I will coup to her I will call to
[57:07] her I will draw her unto me I'm here to

[57:12] friend you have is full of love and full
[57:15] of compassion and he wants to help you
[57:17] his terms are that you must allow him to
[57:20] be Lord of your life and then when you
[57:23] allow him to be complete Lord of your
[57:25] life that's when he can make you a new
[57:27] creation in Christ Jesus there's no
[57:30] question that he loves you with a deep
[57:31] love there's no
[57:34] question there's no question that he
[57:36] loves you with a deep love and he
[57:39] desires to share his eternal life with
[57:42] you he desires to share his entire
[57:46] Kingdom with you he you know that's what
[57:48] he said to Esther to the half of my
[57:50] kingdom the half of my kingdom is an
[57:53] Eastern way of monarchs saying I'll
[57:56] share it all with you it's not that's
[57:58] not their way of saying I'll have half
[58:00] and you have half they're saying to the
[58:03] to the half of my kingdom in other words
[58:05] everything I am you'll be all of my
[58:07] position you'll have we'll we'll we're
[58:09] going to share this thing together a
[58:11] king and a queen
[58:14] Hallelujah he desires to share his
[58:17] entire Kingdom Universe wide with you he
[58:20] desires to place you in a position of
[58:22] usefulness he desires to place you in a
[58:25] position of authority
[58:26] he wants to be able to trust
[58:30] you so he tests you and he tries you to
[58:35] strengthen you as I said that's why
[58:38] Trials come don't let them weaken you
[58:40] amen don't let them weaken you that's
[58:42] not why they
[58:44] come he's training you and you must be
[58:47] willing to come through his training and
[58:51] sometimes friends there are things that
[58:54] God is training you for that I would
[58:56] just say it like this it it'll be a
[58:59] lifetime of
[59:02] training because you remember as I've
[59:05] said to you so many times over the years
[59:07] this life ain't about this one it's
[59:09] about the one coming and so your whole
[59:12] lifetime there are things in my life
[59:14] that I'm still being trained on and
[59:16] every time I think I've got it figured
[59:18] out I get a whole new textbook and as
[59:21] soon as I memorize all that one I get a
[59:23] whole another textbook and I realize
[59:25] this is training for life because he's
[59:28] training me for an eternal
[59:30] life the choice is yours it always is
[59:33] it's always up to you put as simply as I
[59:35] can the only decision to be made is
[59:39] yours because you already know his I've
[59:41] proven it to you in the Bible
[59:44] amen last time we covered a lot of
[59:47] scriptures I don't want to go back over
[59:49] all of those again I'm just going to
[59:51] mention a few briefly God's love and
[59:53] compassion are seen in the Book of
[59:55] Romans Paul uh that's one of the
[59:57] greatest books The Book of Romans is the
[59:59] book Martin Luther said every Christian
[1:00:01] should memorize I guess in Luther's eyes
[1:00:04] I'm not quite a Christian because I
[1:00:05] ain't memorized it but it but they but
[1:00:08] it said that if you were deserted on a
[1:00:10] on a on a deserted island and you could
[1:00:12] only have one book out of the entire
[1:00:13] Bible you'd want the book of
[1:00:15] Romans uh and it is it is a profound
[1:00:18] book but we find that Romans 5'8 says
[1:00:21] God demonstrates his love for us he
[1:00:25] doesn't just say it's not just
[1:00:27] Whispering sweet nothings he just
[1:00:28] doesn't say I love you he actually
[1:00:31] demonstrates his love in this that while
[1:00:34] we were still sinners Christ died for us
[1:00:38] what more proof do you need verses 9 to
[1:00:42] 11 go on to show how that we were
[1:00:44] justified by the blood of Christ and
[1:00:46] that we were saved from God's Wrath and
[1:00:50] we have been reconciled back to God
[1:00:52] through Jesus Christ through repentance
[1:00:54] and faith and we're now Justified and
[1:00:57] reconciled we become New Creations no
[1:01:00] longer think about being a new creation
[1:01:02] you're no longer an enemy of God you're
[1:01:05] no longer lost in sin you're no longer a
[1:01:09] tool of the devil thank God thank God I
[1:01:12] don't want to be a tool of the devil I
[1:01:15] don't want to be that I want to be in
[1:01:17] the hand of almighty
[1:01:19] God we found out that in Paul taught the
[1:01:23] Corinthian Church in the 15th chapter of
[1:01:26] First Corinthians that in Adam all die
[1:01:28] but in Christ all are Made Alive your
[1:01:30] your natural birth you were doomed face
[1:01:33] it I'm sorry don't let that hurt your
[1:01:36] feelings don't let that put you in a bad
[1:01:38] mood I know you got great parents and
[1:01:41] you might be a great person but because
[1:01:43] of the way you were born you're a dead
[1:01:45] person you're dying and you're dying and
[1:01:48] when you're done dying you're dying more
[1:01:51] but I'm here to tell you that you can be
[1:01:53] made alive in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:57] we found out in first John chap 1 that
[1:01:59] salvation and forgiveness comes through
[1:02:01] him if we confess our sins he's faithful
[1:02:04] and just to forgive our sins and to
[1:02:07] cleanse us from all
[1:02:09] unrighteousness we found out that when
[1:02:11] you're a new creation as Paul talks
[1:02:13] about to the Corinthian Church in 2
[1:02:15] Corinthians 5 how that you have a new
[1:02:18] life of righteousness and that that that
[1:02:21] in fact is you are now in Union with God
[1:02:24] in Union with God
[1:02:27] you talk about
[1:02:28] new a new creation th this is a this is
[1:02:33] the renewal of a person's entire
[1:02:37] identity and not only your entire
[1:02:39] identity but a whole renewal of your
[1:02:41] entire
[1:02:42] purpose do you Embrace that here tonight
[1:02:45] friends you say oh I I I thank you for
[1:02:49] saving me Lord see you in heaven nothing
[1:02:51] you're a new creation in Christ your
[1:02:54] whole identity's changed your whole
[1:02:56] purpose is
[1:02:57] new this isn't a social gospel you
[1:03:00] didn't come here just to believe some
[1:03:02] Doctrine you come here to receive
[1:03:04] eternal life you come to have a friend
[1:03:07] in Jesus you come to have he's going to
[1:03:10] share his kingdom with you why would he
[1:03:14] let you why would he give you to share
[1:03:15] his kingdom and you keep your own
[1:03:19] purpose what who would do
[1:03:22] that you want to keep your own purpose
[1:03:24] and your own identity and
[1:03:26] and who you were you don't want to you
[1:03:28] don't want to change or be
[1:03:30] changed see so when you're going to
[1:03:33] become a new creation in Christ This is
[1:03:36] a renewal of your entire identity we
[1:03:39] find out that God has reconciled all
[1:03:42] things to himself that's beautiful in
[1:03:44] Colossians 1 because it explains that
[1:03:47] when God reconciled all things to
[1:03:49] himself then our past sins no longer
[1:03:52] Define
[1:03:54] us what what a friend we have in
[1:04:00] Jesus think about that friends that that
[1:04:04] when you're reconciled because God God
[1:04:09] reconciled you to himself now all your
[1:04:13] past sins I don't care what they were
[1:04:16] they no longer Define you amen you don't
[1:04:20] owe the devil nothing you don't have to
[1:04:24] explain nothing you from here on you
[1:04:26] don't have to account for nothing you
[1:04:28] don't need to please him you don't need
[1:04:30] a treaty with him you're a new creation
[1:04:32] in Christ old things have passed away
[1:04:35] you don't need anybody's permission to
[1:04:36] be happy you don't need anybody's
[1:04:39] permission to have faith you don't need
[1:04:41] anybody's permission to have peace that
[1:04:43] passes understanding you can have all
[1:04:46] things of from the kingdom of
[1:04:48] God he's a help in time of trouble as we
[1:04:51] found out in Psalms 46 he's a refuge and
[1:04:54] a strength very present help he's full
[1:04:58] of love and compassion Psalms 103 the
[1:05:01] Lord is compassionate and gracious slow
[1:05:03] to anger abounding in
[1:05:05] love we found out that that that that
[1:05:09] when a wicked person he tells Ezekiel in
[1:05:12] the 18th
[1:05:13] chapter where it said that if a wicked
[1:05:15] person turns from their
[1:05:18] sins is all you got to do turn from your
[1:05:22] sins turn your eyes Eyes Upon
[1:05:28] Jesus look full in his wonderful face
[1:05:33] you know what happen the things of this
[1:05:36] world will grow strangely
[1:05:40] dim they just begin to lose their appeal
[1:05:43] you don't you don't like them anymore
[1:05:45] you don't want that kind of stuff
[1:05:47] anymore you a you actually get to a
[1:05:49] point where you turn and he said whoever
[1:05:52] will do that whoever is W whoever is a
[1:05:54] wicked person if they'll just but turn
[1:05:57] from their sins they will live and not
[1:06:01] die I'm giving you the word of the
[1:06:05] Creator turn from your Wicked Ways say
[1:06:07] I've been pretty wicked just turn say
[1:06:10] but if you only knew what I've done well
[1:06:12] if God gets a hold of your life nobody's
[1:06:14] ever going to know because it's going to
[1:06:17] go out completely off the records and
[1:06:19] annals of human history and on the other
[1:06:22] side I'm going to tell you something
[1:06:24] friend you'll never have to get an
[1:06:25] account for any of that stuff
[1:06:28] amen friendship with God my what a
[1:06:32] friend we have in Jesus we're partakers
[1:06:36] of his kingdom he's a help in time of
[1:06:38] trouble he's Lo loving and compassionate
[1:06:42] he forgives sins he has every provision
[1:06:45] you know thing everything that you'd
[1:06:47] expect from a friend who cared about you
[1:06:50] and had the power to do something about
[1:06:54] it
[1:06:56] you know in our text when I think about
[1:07:01] Mary you know
[1:07:03] Mary knew like no other could really
[1:07:09] Mary knew what couldn't be fully
[1:07:13] explained now Mary could tell what was
[1:07:17] said she could relate the story she
[1:07:20] tried to tell everybody she told Joseph
[1:07:22] told her family told the community but
[1:07:24] nobody believed
[1:07:26] her Mary actually could could you know
[1:07:30] could go over it verbatim she could
[1:07:34] actually write a record of it and say I
[1:07:37] was in my room it was this certain time
[1:07:39] on this certain day and and you know the
[1:07:42] the Bible only gives us a little bit of
[1:07:44] the idea of the time of it but Mary
[1:07:46] could have actually detailed out it was
[1:07:48] about 70 degrees in Palestine and it was
[1:07:51] coming on to evening and I had just had
[1:07:53] my supper and I was in my room suddenly
[1:07:55] I heard a noise and and suddenly a
[1:07:58] dimensional window opened in my room and
[1:08:01] a man stepped through
[1:08:03] it Mary could explain it she could tell
[1:08:06] what was said to her she could she could
[1:08:09] make plain the teaching she could dot
[1:08:11] every eye she could cross every tea but
[1:08:14] that's not the same as as having the
[1:08:19] experience I want you to understand that
[1:08:21] Mary which is a type of us the perfect
[1:08:24] type of the bride at the end time had to
[1:08:26] go through
[1:08:28] it Mary had to experience
[1:08:31] it it it wasn't I mean isn't that where
[1:08:34] we are sometimes we we try to teach
[1:08:37] somebody Doctrine we try to answer their
[1:08:40] questions what is it you believe where
[1:08:42] do you go to church what do you teach
[1:08:43] there what and you you try to tell them
[1:08:45] well this that and the other well what
[1:08:46] about this well you know the Bible says
[1:08:48] well well what's this about a prophet
[1:08:50] well the Bible says and we can tell all
[1:08:52] about it we can even tell our testimony
[1:08:54] we can say you know the Lord revealed it
[1:08:55] to me and I was in a bar and the Lord
[1:08:58] came and met me and brought me out and
[1:09:00] brought me to this glorious truth and
[1:09:02] and you you can actually dot the eyes
[1:09:03] and cross the tees but but that's still
[1:09:07] somebody hearing your words they're
[1:09:09] still not
[1:09:11] experiencing they hear your words you
[1:09:13] can teach them the words but there you
[1:09:16] got to go through this you got to be
[1:09:20] here it's not going to be enough friends
[1:09:21] on the other side it's not going to be
[1:09:23] that I'm I'm going to they're going to
[1:09:25] say remember brother B talks about how
[1:09:27] that that last group that Leota group
[1:09:30] how that there will be such a hush go
[1:09:32] over the people that let the Bride of
[1:09:34] leot SE arise and when the Bride of leot
[1:09:37] arises what an a struck scene then the
[1:09:40] people will say how how did you make it
[1:09:43] we looked in that age and we thought
[1:09:45] it's so dark no one could survive it and
[1:09:48] here you are how did you do it and
[1:09:50] you're not going to try to teach them
[1:09:52] the seventh seal you're not going to
[1:09:53] talk to them about water baptism you're
[1:09:55] going to say I don't really know all all
[1:09:57] I know is I went through it and I kept
[1:10:00] going and I kept pressing and something
[1:10:02] wouldn't let me go I experienced
[1:10:06] it I'm here because of an experience
[1:10:10] that I
[1:10:11] had she knew like no other Mary knew
[1:10:14] that she you know the she knew she
[1:10:16] hadn't been
[1:10:17] touched Mary knew that nobody believed
[1:10:20] her but she knew like no other that she
[1:10:23] didn't do that she hadn't started it
[1:10:26] Mary Knew by experience she hadn't
[1:10:29] started
[1:10:30] it and she knew by
[1:10:32] experience she couldn't stop
[1:10:36] it she told everybody about it she
[1:10:40] endured all that came by from people who
[1:10:42] didn't believe it and couldn't
[1:10:44] understand it all the
[1:10:46] questions all the
[1:10:49] slander you know something we deal with
[1:10:52] that today all the questions all the
[1:10:55] false accusations all the slander you
[1:10:59] know but Mary's my type Mary couldn't
[1:11:01] worry about that I can't worry about
[1:11:04] that Mary knew she needed you know what
[1:11:06] Mary knew Mary knew she needed to take
[1:11:09] steps to make sure that this was a
[1:11:12] healthy pregnancy and a healthy delivery
[1:11:15] I I I'm bringing forth the Son of God
[1:11:18] I'm bringing forth the Christ child I'm
[1:11:20] bringing forth the word I ain't got time
[1:11:22] to listen to slander I ain't got time to
[1:11:25] worry about criticism I'm not going to
[1:11:27] answer every question I'm saying this

[1:12:26] easy it was
[1:12:28] Supernatural it was the power of God but
[1:12:32] it wasn't going to be
[1:12:34] easy what what do we want sometimes yeah
[1:12:38] brother brother Brandon would often you
[1:12:40] know quote that poem and it's actually a
[1:12:42] lengthy poem it's very beautiful and he
[1:12:45] would often just quote that brother
[1:12:46] brandham loved poetry and he would quote
[1:12:49] that one part over and over and over you
[1:12:51] know must I uh be on a flowery bed of
[1:12:54] eeds While others fought to win the

[1:13:54] can
[1:13:59] yeah the physical things Mary would have
[1:14:02] to go through the social things she
[1:14:04] would have to endure the psychological
[1:14:06] trials would be epic she was she was
[1:14:09] making a
[1:14:11] claim that was was unfounded in
[1:14:15] history this is ridiculous
[1:14:18] Mary no human has ever done what you're
[1:14:24] saying
[1:14:29] but Abraham
[1:14:31] knew in Genesis
[1:14:33] 22 when he called the place Jehovah Gyra
[1:14:37] he knew the Lord would provide
[1:14:41] amen God's provision and blessing are
[1:14:44] established in the New Testament
[1:14:46] Philippians 4 my God will meet all your
[1:14:49] needs according to the riches of his
[1:14:52] glory in Christ
[1:14:54] Jesus hey you believe
[1:14:57] that I mean either you do or you
[1:15:00] don't my God will meet all your
[1:15:04] needs according to the riches of his
[1:15:07] glory in Christ Jesus Philippians
[1:15:10] 4:19 Malachi 3:10 God promises to open
[1:15:13] the windows of heaven and pour out a
[1:15:16] blessing Mary was going to need a a door
[1:15:18] to open in heaven Mary was going to need
[1:15:21] that dimensional Doorway to open this
[1:15:24] age needed that he said I I I he set an
[1:15:27] open door at the end of the
[1:15:29] Philadelphian age right in that lap over
[1:15:31] time going into the leoan age because
[1:15:33] that open door anytime God opens the a
[1:15:36] door in heaven anytime you see the
[1:15:39] heavens open that's always God bringing
[1:15:41] a
[1:15:42] revelation that's what Mary was going to
[1:15:45] need see that's what happened that's
[1:15:47] what Ezekiel Saw Ezekiel standing by the
[1:15:50] river chebar and he said the heavens
[1:15:52] were opened and what was happening
[1:15:55] started bringing down a revelation next
[1:15:56] thing you know Ezekiel starts talking
[1:15:58] about those that Amber color starts
[1:16:00] talking about those living creatures
[1:16:02] those cherubs around the throne starts
[1:16:03] describing the throne what does it do an
[1:16:06] Open Door starts bringing a
[1:16:07] revelation what what what happened with
[1:16:10] what happened with John the Baptist John
[1:16:11] the Baptist is standing there and the
[1:16:14] heavens opened and the spirit of God
[1:16:16] descended and gave him a revelation this
[1:16:18] is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to
[1:16:21] dwell what what did Stephen see he said
[1:16:24] I see see Heavens open and the Christ
[1:16:26] sitting on the right hand it was a
[1:16:28] revelation the last thing that God did
[1:16:30] what did Peter see he saw the heavens
[1:16:33] open and a net let down with every kind
[1:16:35] of unclean beast and he said Lord I'll
[1:16:37] not touch that it's unclean the Lord
[1:16:38] said don't you call unclean what I have
[1:16:41] cleansed see so so John John comes to
[1:16:44] the End of the Age we at the End of the
[1:16:46] Age and and and and brother B shows it
[1:16:50] how that at the end of chapter three he
[1:16:53] the church goes up and and and and you
[1:16:56] see John a door is open in heaven and so
[1:16:59] the church goes up brother R said the
[1:17:00] church goes up at the end of chapter 3
[1:17:02] because that's the end of leoa meaning
[1:17:04] there's not going to be another church
[1:17:05] age and she's not seen again until
[1:17:08] Revelation 19 when what happens the
[1:17:10] heavens are opened and out she comes see
[1:17:13] you see and that that was a that was and
[1:17:15] what would that be to the world a
[1:17:16] revelation of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:17:19] you you understand that so so brother
[1:17:22] brandham explains that in chapter four
[1:17:25] and five God C the Lord is showing how
[1:17:29] he pulled it off how he got that church
[1:17:30] perfected how he was moving all the time
[1:17:33] in the church now he had already showed
[1:17:35] that in Revelation 2 and Revelation
[1:17:37] three but we were coming to a day that
[1:17:39] was unique a day that unlike any other
[1:17:42] day just like Mary to an impossible time
[1:17:45] to a Time unprecedented in human history
[1:17:48] where where Lucifer listen here's where
[1:17:50] you live you want to you better have a
[1:17:52] friend in Jesus you're living living in
[1:17:55] an age that's Satan's Eden no other age
[1:17:58] faced that Satan's now had 6,000 years
[1:18:01] to build his Eden just like God had
[1:18:03] 6,000 to build his Lucifer has been
[1:18:07] elected by the people to be the god of
[1:18:10] the
[1:18:12] age that's never happened th this is a
[1:18:15] time of the great apostasy this is the
[1:18:17] time of the man of sin being revealed th
[1:18:20] this is the time when the dead in Christ
[1:18:22] come forth and the bride is perfected
[1:18:23] and taken and arest oh friends what an
[1:18:26] hour that we live in and this is exactly
[1:18:29] what would happen to H this is what
[1:18:31] would have to happen for Mary it would
[1:18:33] it would literally take the opening of
[1:18:35] Heaven to her and an angel stepping
[1:18:38] through a door and coming from that
[1:18:40] world into her world with a message of
[1:18:43] Grace that's exactly what's happened to
[1:18:46] you she was told she was told we read it
[1:18:49] in our text you read it with me you are
[1:18:52] highly favored friends when when she's
[1:18:55] told she's highly favored remember that
[1:18:59] Grace you're you're highly
[1:19:02] favored we know that Grace is the unmar
[1:19:06] favor of God so what was he saying to
[1:19:09] Mary Mary you're highly
[1:19:12] graced that's why the prophet said in
[1:19:14] this day that's why Mary's such a type
[1:19:17] because the headstone comes crying Grace
[1:19:19] Grace unto it you are highly graced say
[1:19:23] I got a weakness you're highly graced
[1:19:25] I don't know how I can pull it off you
[1:19:27] can't he can you're highly
[1:19:31] favored this is his
[1:19:34] doing no wonder she was a type for our
[1:19:36] day all she could do was keep going all
[1:19:39] she could do was just keep holding

[1:20:04] special powers there's no secret I just
[1:20:08] held on Amen and I held on till the
[1:20:12] storm was over I don't claim to be a
[1:20:15] hero and I don't have all the answers
[1:20:20] but I held on till the storm was over
[1:20:23] not because I'm good not because I'm
[1:20:26] great not because I'm
[1:20:29] strong I just held

[1:20:47] in Revelation

[1:26:05] many times just like Mary I've said how
[1:26:09] can this
[1:26:10] be I've had to look at my own failures
[1:26:14] in bitter anguish and say how in the
[1:26:16] world can this be how will I
[1:26:18] ever bring forth the Perfection of the
[1:26:22] word and and bring this body and mind so
[1:26:26] subject to God that it'll one day be
[1:26:29] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:26:33] an eye Lord I have resolved so many
[1:26:37] times that the answer is I can't do
[1:26:41] it I just can't I'd like to be able to
[1:26:45] say I could but I'm just like Mary all I
[1:26:49] can say is be it unto me according to
[1:26:53] your word
[1:26:55] she said behold the hands made of the
[1:26:57] Lord in other words here I stand I can
[1:27:00] do nothing more you've said
[1:27:04] it you're the one showed up you're the
[1:27:07] one who stepped through that dimensional
[1:27:08] doorway you opened Heavens to me he
[1:27:11] opened heaven to us friend he gave us a
[1:27:13] revelation of his word if he loves us
[1:27:16] that much will he not finish this job oh
[1:27:20] Master Lord this world so impossible and
[1:27:24] I I say again Lord our our task is even
[1:27:27] more difficult even more impossible than
[1:27:31] Mary's all she was doing was bringing
[1:27:34] forth a natural child that's god brother
[1:27:36] brandham said even the even the human
[1:27:38] natural birth was more amazing than what
[1:27:40] Mary did that I I have never thought to
[1:27:44] say that that's what a prophet said a
[1:27:46] human birth is more amazing than what
[1:27:49] happened to Mary cuz brother bam said
[1:27:51] because that's just God God can do
[1:27:53] anything but how does a man and a woman
[1:27:55] come together seed is exchanged an egg
[1:27:57] is fertilized and a child grows from it
[1:27:59] and becomes a human being with a living
[1:28:01] Soul how this Mystery of Life Lord how
[1:28:05] much more incredible will it be that a
[1:28:08] bride can go down in in the into the
[1:28:11] history books this Bride of the last day
[1:28:15] that she came on the scene in a time of
[1:28:18] impossibility of complete darkness total
[1:28:22] apostasy even Christ even put out of his
[1:28:25] own
[1:28:27] church Satan elected by the people to be
[1:28:30] the god of the age
[1:28:33] impossible total Satan's Eden with
[1:28:36] control over every facet and every
[1:28:39] aspect of our human lives and we walk
[1:28:42] around in this impossible Darkness
[1:28:45] yet your word Can't Fail thank you all I
[1:28:49] can do is believe your word all I can do
[1:28:52] is hold on today and hold on on tomorrow
[1:28:54] and hold on the next day and hold on the
