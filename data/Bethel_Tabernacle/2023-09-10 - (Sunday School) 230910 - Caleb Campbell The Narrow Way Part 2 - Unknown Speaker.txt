TRANSCRIPT
========================================
presence here Lord father God many times Lord as a speaker father we can get in our own way father Lord but I pray that the same amount of inspiration Lord and anointing that you laid on my heart for this Lord would Lord come off of the page and into the hearts of your people here this morning Lord we love you and again and we just invite your presence Lord the most important thing here father in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Saints let's open and open to our Bibles here in the Book of Matthew this is going to be a part two from last week so uh Matthew the seventh chapter Matthew 7 we're going to read just two two verses here Matthew 7 13 through 14. amen it says enter ye at the Straight Gate for wide as the gate and Broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in there at because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it now if we turn over into the Book of Numbers way back numbers 14 and 41 we're going to read a few verses there to tie in to our part 2 here numbers 14 and verse 41 says as Moses said wherefore now do ye transgress the Commandment of the Lord but it shall not Prosper go not up for the Lord is not among you that ye be not smitten before your enemies for the amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you and ye shall sword because ye are turned away from the Lord therefore the Lord will not be with you but they presumed to go up under the hilltop nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and Moses departed not out of the camp then the amalekites came down and the Canaanites which dwell in the hill and smote them and discomforted them even unto horma amen you can be seated this morning as the Lord blesses the reading of his word the subject was the narrow way with a subtitle today we're going to subtitle emphasizing the message and I have a lot a lot of material again this morning but I don't have a lot of time to recap last week's but we'll make some references as we go along there in numbers it talks about how the people came to Moses and Moses gave them this direction to go not up for the for your for the Lord is not going to be among you and you're going to be Smitten by your enemies but even though they add the word of the Lord and they had this message from their Prophet at the time they presumed to go up under the hilltop anyway and brother random picks that up in that sermon presuming he preaches a few times and that word presume is to be to supposed to be without proof supposed to be true without proof to take for granted Webster says it means to venture without actual Authority or to take it for granted to do something before you were authorized to do it and without the actual authority to do it the Israelites were here went off to a place where Moses said the Lord wouldn't be and he warned them don't go up there but they did it anyway and they left the prophet and the Ark there they left the word and the only thing that it was the only thing that protected him the whole their whole journey and they left it somewhere and went on their own way and we touched on this last week but you know that's a big portion of the modern gospel today they pursue because they they take a part of what the Bible says but they're venturing out on the on their own for the rest of it they think they're on the right path but it's actually a path to destruction he says and he doesn't want to go out on that you know the quote we read last week got Christ as the mystery of God revealed God doesn't want anybody to go out on that path he he says that quote literally says that the Gates of Hell have to spread open to receive them brother Branham says in presuming 1962 he says you hear so much today I say again about being a good god there was a teenage boy I said not long ago you know the Lord just loves me so well he lets me do anything my friends he is a good god and I'll admit that but he is a God of Justice he is a God that requires Justice how can that be just and how can he be just and disobey his own laws how can he defile his own holy laws if he is just he has to stick by what he said if he will require this of you and you don't come to that point if he isn't just then why didn't he let Eve get by with that one little misconstrue of the word and one of the one of the misconstrues of that when they're up on that Hilltop you know he's not trying to be uh you know uh you know trying to put his put his fist on you and say don't do this he says no I'm warning you I can't go into this place with you don't go don't go on your own way you know you know God isn't isn't a mean God he's a loving God he wants to do everything for you he wants to give you a word he wants to give you Revelation but sometimes we go and we presume to go on our own way without our own in our own thinking but there's only one way we can go John 3 5 says verily verily I say unto you except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that another quote there in paragraph 165 of presuming says and that's what's the matter of today you're trying to preach the gospel with soft gloves on and presuming it's all right what the church needs today is to be shut down come back to the gospel you're presuming it's all right I'm Pentecostal I'm this that or the other that's all right it's not all right it's not according to the word you've got to come to the word such a good God they don't presume that he is a God of Justice moving further into what brother Branham says here moving past just denominations because I believe many of us here probably have never been to a denominational Church you know they didn't we didn't come out of denominations we we've grown up but that same exact construct can take place in a message church we can't presume that it's all right to live any old way and then come to church or to live a watered-down version of the Gospel is our life matching up with the word brother random says if it's not all right it's not according to the word you've got to come to the word the prophet says brother Jason preached a sermon a few weeks ago that marveling into mystery and he talked about the importance of emphasizing God's word through his prophet in our lives and Ma what a sermon um if you didn't if you didn't listen definitely go listen just to give some reference from Material there from part one the Lord spoke to a man some thousand years ago his name was Noah he sent him a message build a boat preach it live it and construct it just the way I tell you to do it with these instructions with these material with a specific type of wood and we've read that Sunday School Story you know our whole lives you know God sent a flood but the only thing that people seem to remember about that story is that there was a rainbow after it happened and even that beautiful representation of God's promise to us is now misrepresented in a culture of sinful living you know they wave this rainbow they stole that from a holy God and just like Satan does they perverted it the Lord spoke to a prophet in our day he gave him the materials to get us out of our our way of thinking and our way of life so that we could get home and I believe that that message that he gave is what we should eat and breathe I believe with all my heart we ought to get back to emphasizing the importance of this precious message listening to it studying it reading it you know I wasn't sure on how to go with this but I was just so inspired to go down this simple path studying the message should be such a priority in our lives those that have gone before us you know they lived and they they breathed this message my grandparents you know they were around before we had instant access to the messages you know at the click of a finger they were there when they were still transcribing the books and you know they would get a month's worth of books and you know my goodness they would dive into those things this was God's word this is this is fresh to us it was God's message you know and brother Branham was the one that God sent to give it the vessel the voice of which he chose to use Matthew 10 40 says he that receiveth you receiveth me he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward you know young people middle-aged people old people I hope this can stir our hearts this morning the message studying this message is is way better than than binge watching TV shows it's way better than video games it's way better than those things I promise you you get to witness the supernatural in our in our day do you have those slides brother if you could bring those slides up the first the first one you go read in Life Magazine I had a friend of mine uh give give me an actual copy of this and it's a it's a printed copy in 1963 I know we're probably all familiar with it but Dr James McDonald's a meteorologist at The Institute of the atmospheric physics in Tucson did trigonomic calculations and discovered that the cloud was 60 or 26 miles high and 30 miles across and it was titled A Kai cloud ring of mystery these kind of things this is God appearing to his bride these kinds of things are exciting the next slide you know what about the time that Jesus in the form of a pillar of fire comes and allows a camera to take a photo of them and with the prophet at the Houston Coliseum I don't know if you have that next slide brother that photo still sits in the Library of Congress my parents went there and actually saw it for themselves and I love that picture because it hangs in my house not because it's just a picture of the Prophet it's a picture of the Lord Jesus himself pictured with the prophet that's why it's so important and it's documented scientific proof that it's unexplainable something Supernatural but we can explain it thank the Lord and it was Jesus himself what about the time that you know brother Branham was up there in Sabino Canyon and the sword appeared into his hands you know just to dramatize here for a minute brother Benham does it the best he says and I had my hands out and all at once there in the seventh seal something hit my hand I don't know I can't say it did I go to sleep I don't know did I go into a trance I don't know was it a Division I can't tell you only thing I can say is just the same thing like them Angels was it struck my hand and looked and it was a sword it had a pearl handle real pretty and had a guard over it with gold the blade looked like something like a chrome or like silver it was real shiny it was so feather edge sharp oh my I thought isn't that the prettiest thing just fit my hand I thought that's awful pretty I said hey I'm always afraid of them things a sword I thought well what will I do with it and just then a voice shook down through there rocked across the Rocks it's the sword of the king and then I came out of it the sword of the king now if I said a sword of the king but it said the sword of the king now there is only one the king he says and that that's God and he has the sword and his sword that's what I've lived by so help me God standing over there his holy desk with this holy word laying here it's the word amen what we're doing is we're what a day we're living in what a great thing oh the mystery and the secret the handle was made of pearl the guard was gold the it was razor sharp glistening silver a voice that shook down oh my Saints I don't know about you but this kind of stuff gets me excited it gets me thinking about man the lord loves us so much that he's doing these things in our lives and he's he's showing it and he's allowing these things to happen in our lives and this is the god that we read about in the Bible he's moving in our day you know what about the the light if we have that third picture the light I sent this uh there's a testimony of this there's a light that that comes across after brother Brandon preaches the church ages that draws the each of the moon phases there at the back of the the the Tabernacle there you know brother brother branham's deacon at the time told a story to his son it was a first-hand account this is like the Bible times when Daniel in the Book of Daniel when the hand appeared and supernaturally wrote on the wall many many tarkle a Parson and that was a hand of warning at the time but this was a hand of vindication confirming to the people that this is my word you know that picture hangs you know in many churches um you know some of these things these are just these are just the highlights these are just these are just Parts this is just a part of it and I don't want us to ever fall into the state and I know that we're we're all guilty of this to fall into a state where this is common stuff this is Supernatural this is God sent this is powerful and it's more than just some awesome historical events or Supernatural events laid within it is depths of a revelation that God wants to give to us at every time in our lives we have a question about it we have we have uh we have questions in our hearts we we pray for things and and then something is laid upon someone's heart to maybe Minister that thing and then he uses a a quote from the prophet at this time to minister this and then that answers something in your heart everything that God ever has is laid within his word and everything that he has for you is already there for you somewhere it's just the right time in the right place and the right season that it has to come Jesus says there in Matthew 13 verse 11 he answers the son of them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given but blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them many will see and not understand or hear and not grasp what's laid within the word but thanks be to God we are a people that do and many people desired to see the things that we've seen and I'm just so thankful for it I believe that any Divine message that the Lord wants to give to me I believe it's important and it's something that I want to hear amen now if we're honest with ourselves we can just transition here for a second if we're honest with ourselves how many of us have listened to more than one message this week and going even further than that if we did listen to a message was it just on in the background or was it something that you listen to that you studied that you gave your heart to now this is convicting this is convicting to me too what distracts you what takes your time lay it down Saints it's not worth it we have to the scripture says we have to lay down those weights we have to stop making excuses you know I can be the most guilty of the bunch but I believe we ought to be honest with ourselves and really get back to the basics of Walking with God you know brother Branham is one of the best preachers you'll ever listen to if you go through one of his messages a majority of his messages are titles from scriptures to the word and then he expounds and he brings those scriptures to life even in just preparing for this Sunday school I was going through two or three sermons there mostly in 1963 and he references at least a dozen scriptures in each sermon and when he references it I open up my Bible or my Bible app and I go and I read that scripture and I make a study out of it sometimes then by reading those scriptures then it inspires me to read the rest of the chapter and then by reading the rest of the chapter the Bible turns into a study and that study turns into some Revelation that the Lord has been wanting to give to me and so listening to One message becomes an entire Bible study so that's that's the way God wants to do it in our lives he wants us to read the word he wants to make a study he wants to give you Revelation but he wants us to make an effort to do it amen he loves speaking to us through his word he loves to do that but there are so many distractions that can take take our mind away from just the basics of of Bible study you know Mike I was just fellowship with my uh my cousin the other day and we were just talking about it and you know there the book of Acts when they had to you know sit there for 10 days and wait imagine the distractions now we can't even sit for 10 hours and if that was if 10 hours of waiting you know if we were able to do that in today's world it would be an absolute miracle and it's true it's funny but it's so true it's you know there's so many things that lay there but this message is God's material touching back on last week we talked about the Rich Young Ruler you know presumed the rest of his life that if he kept on living the same way that he had been living that it would probably be okay but scripture says that he ended up in hell we can't let a modern Social Gospel deceiving us into thinking that the gate is now any less narrow than it was when Jesus preached that Sermon on the Mount he's the same yesterday today and forever in Noah's time brother Brenham says in 1962 presuming he says in Noah's time they presumed if it came uh if it came up come a flood like Noah said it would do well the only thing they'd do is jump in their own boat but there was only one boat that was God constructed we can't jump in our own boats this morning even in our lives you know we take something God says and maybe we compromise it with it not even realizing sometimes we do we let reasoning step in and say well that's not exactly like the world and and you know and what I dress or in in the decisions I make or what we allow to enter our homes or in our in our team in our entertainment excuse me and we compromise a reason and say that it's you know it's really not that bad but if you're not careful you become exactly like those Israelites standing up there and says well you know your word says this but you know we're living we're living in this modern time now so I think it's probably okay to go and do this well that's not what the word says that's not that's not what the Bible says the Bible says that he is the same yesterday today and forever and he has a way and he doesn't want anybody to go a different way he has that it's it's a narrow way but it's the way of Jesus Jesus is the way he is the truth he is the life he goes on to say in paragraph 212 of that same sermon he says but what would they do they don't try to have wisdom of their own they can't figure it out you're not supposed to figure it out you're just supposed to believe it say when he's referring to Noah he says said take shitam wood it's just as light like a sponge but now notice after he got all the of wood destroyed destructed constructed rather he said go and take pitch and soak it up how did they get pitch in them days they took another kind of tree pine tree they beat it until the pitch run out of it what's it a type of the Timber God has got today empty out all your old fanatic stuff empty out all your organizations get real light and just lay before God then he beat one of us he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities he was beaten wounded bruised recovery that his Spirit might pour upon you when you have nothing the next the next paragraph he says and then that boat the ark when he set up there even a nail couldn't be driven into it that's the reason the big logs hitting against it wouldn't bust a hole in it why Oak Pine or nothing else would not hold like that see it was already soaked and the pitch was already inside and out that's right that's the way a Christian is he empties himself I don't want to know what anybody I want to know what the Lord I want to know you I want you your life then God just soak up in Christ here's a real simple yet a profound lesson from the the prophet just soak up in Christ how do we how do we soak up in Christ it's not you know just manufacturing something it's not trying to force yourself into this life it's it's laying before the the lord it's it comes with these instructions verse uh Ephesians 4 from the word says but ye have not so learned Christ if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that ye put off concerning the former conversation of the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind that ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness so you put on a new man you put on a new a complete new person and that is the person the Bible says that God creates in righteousness and in true Holiness so there there's a way to have true Holiness there's a way to have righteousness in this life and it's through God it's through his spirit that be you put it on you put it on a new man what is Paul saying there how do you how do you put on your new man you learn the things of the Bible some basic Bible instructions here Ephesians 5 1 be therefore followers of God as dear dear children and walk in love as Christ hath loved you and hath given himself for us as an offering for us as a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savior be their followers of God learn the word learn the message soak it up soak up Christ every time you can any any opportunity you get to to even listen to a few minutes and and dive into the word and dive into what God has said in our day through the message of the hour those kind of things are what soak up Christ in US and then uh Ephesians 5 going on it says about fornication and uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as become a Saints neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks for this she know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetousness man who isn't a dilator hath any inheritance into the kingdom of Christ and of God and let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience Galatians 5 16 says this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh but these are contrary to one one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that you would but if ye be led by the spirit ye are not under the law so you can't even do the things that you want to do without the spirit of God so you need to have the spirit amen now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these things adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath Strife seditions heresies envings murders drunkenness revelings and such like all of those things those are just your former life if you're not sure if what your former life was is in there uncleanness anything unclean that's your former life and it says uncleanness in there of which I tell you before as I have told you in times past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance and against such there is no law and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and the lusts it says and if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit some of these some of these closing argument quotes here from a couple of messages straight As the gate 1959 paragraph 102 says didn't Jesus say that the spirit speaks expressingly in the last days that they would be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truce Breakers incontinent Fierce and despisers of those that are good having a form of godliness now there's so many classifications laid within that that those verses there the lovers of lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God lovers of pleasure just means that you love entertainment more than you love spending time with the Lord you enjoy you know you enjoy watching movies you enjoy playing video games you enjoy these things more than you enjoy the things of God truce Breakers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good and having a form of godliness remember but denying the power of God having a form of godliness going to church doing these things but then not having the spirit of God put on that new man inside of you speak with tongues he says you can shout you can speak with tongues faith will cast out devil see but that ain't what we're talking about then you would say to me brother Branham what is the mark of a Christian who will be saved will you brother Branham I'm trusting that to God I don't know I'm believing that I am listen to this but I'm comparing my life daily with the word if it don't live up to this word then there's something wrong I've got to go back and get right yeah that is just some basic instructions right there I am comparing my life not weekly not monthly daily with what the word and if something doesn't live up to the word then let's go back and let's get it right find out what it is find out where it is you know and even even when you're born again of the spirit of God there's still things that line up without the word so that's why we you know we have a walk with Christ and he he puts up puts things on our hearts and he convicts us and says don't do this or maybe go this way or there's things that you can do there's growth there's every stage you are at in your Christian walk there's there's growth unless you're walking with God like Enoch there is growth for you to have in your life and if there's something in your life that doesn't seem to be matching up exactly if there's ever a question in your heart or in your mind even a just a slight question go compare it with the word and if it even just slightly sits on the edge Give It Up give it to the Lord I've got to go back and got to get it right there's nothing more important than that life in Christ are you comparing your life daily with the word he says this in the next paragraph which is night uh paragraph 130 this is The Showdown this is the time when God is a doing things this is when the Messiah is on Earth this is when the power of God is moving in his people they call them holy rulers crazy insane such as that but the hour is here there is sure going to be some great disappointments at the Judgment now when we opened up our text last week that you know in Matthew 7 he says they're going to come in that time and say did not I prophesy in your name did not I did not I cast out devils in your name but he says depart from me you workers of iniquity because in their hearts they didn't ever had a true relationship with God they wanted to do the works of God but they didn't have a true relationship with God The Bootlegger oh he knows where he's going to be at judgment so does The Beer Hound and know he's going to be so does the prostitute know where she'll stand so does the Gambler know where he'll stand so does the drunkard know where he'll stand he'll not be disappointed so the unbelievers know where they're going to be it's the make-believers so but when paragraph 133 but where the disappointed is going to be is those who thought they were right those were the disappointment when they got up there and said sure we cast out Devils we're preachers we belong to certain churches we we've done great Miracles we preach why I've been a steward in the church I've been a I've been a bishop I've been this he'll say depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you there you are that's the discipline he said the children of their children will come in set down in the kingdom and said we've got a right to be here and they'll be cast into outer Darkness where they'll be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth to life and few will be that find it here's just one more quote here he says to you my dear people this morning listen to this I've never made this up I'm responsible for telling it that's all I'm responsible for if I never preach another sermon in my life this is the truth there's just going to be a few people saved now just remember that just a very few so you he he makes a statement there and then there's a period and then you read that and you're like man there's just a few he says but you be one of them amen so it doesn't matter where your brother or your sister you be one of them you put on the mind of Christ you put on that new man you walk with God you start listening to the messages don't worry about what your friend or your brother you do it you put on these things amen who are they brother Benham I don't know nobody else knows but we work out our salvation with fear and trembling Philippians 2 says that work out your salvation with fear and trembling he says but you be lined up with God if your heart doesn't beat just right with that Bible then there's something wrong there's something wrong no matter what the church says you go you can't go in by that you go in by what God says this is the book you'll be judged for from the Bible stay right with it if your hearts don't be just right with the Bible then there's something wrong this is the book he says if I don't ever preach another sermon there'll just be a few but you be that for you amen let's just stand and just closing he says from that other quote he says let's compare our life daily with the word and if we don't lived up to it then I've got to go back and I've got to get it right let's have that some instructions this morning Heavenly Father Lord I pray that father you would just Lord anoint the reading of your word Lord and I pray that it would seed into our hearts Lord God that it wouldn't be Lord uh just a correction father it was a correction for me father but I pray that it would just be life to us Lord that we would go from here Lord and that we would want to have our lives and our hearts beat right with the word be with us today Father be with your minister I pray that you'd anoint him father I pray you be with the musicians the song leader Lord I pray that you'd anoint each ear to hear father today what you have to say for us we love you and we ask all these things now in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you
