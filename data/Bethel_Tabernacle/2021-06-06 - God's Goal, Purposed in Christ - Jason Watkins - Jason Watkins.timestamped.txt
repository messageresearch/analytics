[43:22] and the lord will create upon every
[43:24] dwelling place of mount
[43:26] zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and
[43:29] smoke by day
[43:31] and the shining of a flaming fire by
[43:34] night

[43:37] defense

[43:41] lord

[44:14] master
[44:15] believing that you will feed your people
[44:17] i have such a confidence
[44:19] because you have proven so reliable to
[44:21] do that so we commit it now to you in
[44:23] jesus name
[44:24] lord we remember our families who are
[44:27] out traveling not with us today
[44:29] and we remember our sick lord who are
[44:32] afflicted and we're
[44:33] remembering particularly this morning
[44:35] our dear brother joe
[44:37] lord and and uh brother mark there with
[44:39] him lord streaming the service may the

[44:59] in the hands of jehovah we can rest lord
[45:02] because you
[45:03] are in control of it all so we commit it
[45:05] to you now
[45:06] and commit the reading the hearing of

[45:09] into your hands
[45:10] in jesus name amen god bless you friends
[45:13] you can be seated
[45:17] i guess this must have gotten red
[45:19] acquire practice directly after surface
[45:21] okay very good
[45:27] so i i desired today
[45:31] to take
[45:34] this thought and and if possible then i
[45:37] would also
[45:38] like to give it a subtitle
[45:42] of a great love story and i believe that
[45:46] the plan of redemption is no doubt
[45:50] the greatest love story ever written
[45:53] and it's not just written it's it's not
[45:56] a novel
[45:57] it's a happening and it's been happening
[46:01] for millennia so we look to the lord now
[46:05] and we want you to just consider these
[46:07] passages that we've read
[46:09] i just want to make sure i'm all in
[46:10] order here so
[46:13] brother branham would first address this
[46:16] prophecy that we found
[46:19] in verse 1 and in that day so we needed
[46:23] a prophet to identify to us what day
[46:25] that would be now
[46:26] that's not this is not to dismiss that
[46:28] it had an application
[46:30] in the days of israel in the old
[46:31] testament uh but
[46:33] but even even almost all scholars agree
[46:37] that this
[46:37] is really forecasting uh the tribulation
[46:41] period
[46:42] when when we're at the end and god is
[46:44] going to
[46:45] finally not only purge israel he's going
[46:48] to
[46:48] he's going to purge the whole world and
[46:50] those that
[46:51] survive and who are left in zion and in
[46:54] jerusalem
[46:55] they will be the uh the holy of the lord
[46:58] they will be redeemed
[47:00] i i'm glad that i count myself in that
[47:02] number
[47:03] that i'm i i battle here and i battle
[47:07] constantly that my life can be holy
[47:10] i'm glad that on that day the battle
[47:12] will be over
[47:14] hallelujah it's a fight that i'm all too
[47:16] happy to fight
[47:17] and i intend to keep fighting it i don't
[47:19] intend to back up
[47:20] backslide go backwards i intend to go
[47:22] forwards
[47:23] and every day and if i stumble i'll get
[47:26] up
[47:26] i'll repent i'll dust myself off and
[47:29] i'll pick up my sword
[47:30] and i'll go forward again i'll never
[47:33] stop
[47:36] never stop satan needs to get that i
[47:38] will never
[47:39] stop fighting and so
[47:43] brother branham addresses this the first
[47:45] time that i could find
[47:47] in 1954 this prophecy he's asked the
[47:51] question brother branham can you
[47:52] interpret
[47:53] this is in 1954 questions and answers
[47:56] can you interpret
[47:57] this passage in isaiah 4.
[48:00] and so this of course is nearly two full
[48:04] years to the day almost
[48:06] almost to the day before america
[48:10] would cross the separating line between
[48:12] mercy and judgment
[48:14] and brother branham would would indicate
[48:17] that this was a prophecy
[48:19] concerning the day and hour that was
[48:21] right now
[48:22] and he was saying this prophecy is
[48:25] already coming to pass
[48:26] and it's going to continue to come to
[48:28] pass and he cites the immorality of
[48:31] women particularly
[48:33] um and and he puts that forward as
[48:36] evidence
[48:37] since the time of the first woe in the
[48:39] book of revelation which we know to be
[48:41] world war one and brother branham simply
[48:44] goes back to
[48:45] statistically and says notice that uh
[48:48] that that their that the stats show that
[48:51] gis who came home from that beginning at
[48:53] that war and also happened again
[48:55] in the second woe of world war ii that
[48:57] they they got all these dear john
[48:58] letters and they they came home to
[49:00] find out they were divorced and their
[49:02] wives were with other men who had not
[49:04] gone to war
[49:05] and so brother branham talks about how
[49:08] that
[49:08] you know ever since that time the fall
[49:12] the the thing that broke the back of the
[49:14] nation was the fall of motherhood
[49:16] because
[49:17] you know we had you know rosie the
[49:19] riveter you know during these world wars
[49:21] and
[49:22] let's lead all the women into the
[49:23] workforce and you know and
[49:25] and i mean it's just it in one way
[49:28] humanly speaking it made some
[49:30] sense somebody needed to man the
[49:31] factories and most of the men were at
[49:33] war
[49:34] but you understand that that it was it
[49:37] was the devil
[49:38] using the curse of sin to take advantage
[49:40] and bring
[49:41] and bring down the ruination of this
[49:43] nation
[49:45] and he certainly was successful and we
[49:48] find that from that from that hour
[49:51] divorce rates spiked and have
[49:53] continued to rise to their highest
[49:56] levels in history and
[49:57] until finally you know during the uh
[50:00] you know the the social upheaval and the
[50:03] sexual revolution of the 1960s
[50:06] people just stopped getting married and
[50:09] they just started shacking up and living
[50:11] together and
[50:12] and the citizens of this nation you can
[50:14] see it happening from the time of the
[50:16] first woe particularly
[50:18] you can see that the the citizens of
[50:20] this nation
[50:21] you know have been constantly since that
[50:23] day reaching forever increasing
[50:26] levels of filth and the general
[50:28] degradation of humanity the world over
[50:30] friends i mean that i'm not making this
[50:32] up history
[50:33] shows this to be true
[50:37] you know it was already very pervasive
[50:40] in 1954.
[50:41] i was my wife and i we were fueling up
[50:44] the truck yesterday
[50:45] not just having it fueled for the
[50:47] weekend and and i i'm pulling in
[50:49] you know to what i have the right to do
[50:52] i've got a right to pull my truck
[50:53] into a gas pump and get out and not be
[50:56] assaulted
[50:58] and and i'm not talking about physically
[51:00] i can't even get to the gas pump
[51:02] and there is a young woman so vulgar
[51:05] dressed so vulgar i
[51:06] i have to keep my head down where's my
[51:08] door handle let me not look where's my
[51:09] where's my gas lever and and she's just
[51:12] parading around like she owns the place
[51:14] i'm here to tell you
[51:16] that's that's the curse of sin see
[51:19] it's already pervasive in the world
[51:22] and and and and it's and it's everywhere
[51:25] and you know here we have to fight this
[51:28] fight constantly and it's
[51:30] it's it's been an ever increasing thing
[51:32] since that time
[51:34] in 1954 since the first woes
[51:38] of 1918 and and even before and
[51:41] after that you find that that that's why
[51:44] you when you look at the book of
[51:45] revelation and you see
[51:46] compound meanings where you remember out
[51:49] of the bottomless pit
[51:51] rolled locusts with with hair like women
[51:54] with stings in their tail
[51:56] and they tormented the and brother
[51:59] branham said they tormented they were
[52:01] sent to torment the women
[52:03] who had cut their hair off and so you
[52:06] have a you have
[52:07] actually and i don't not teaching on
[52:09] this today
[52:10] that is certainly got a future
[52:12] fulfillment of a full magnet a full
[52:14] manifestation and tribulation
[52:16] but parts of that were coming under the
[52:18] first woe
[52:19] because that was the torment that's when
[52:22] bobbed hair
[52:23] started bobbed hair that even that term
[52:26] the bob started right there just before
[52:29] the outbreak of the first woe
[52:32] and so now what it what what are the
[52:34] women doing now they're paying a price
[52:36] they're being tormented
[52:37] because now under the judgments of the
[52:39] first woe their sons and their husbands
[52:42] and their dads are being slaughtered
[52:44] on the battlefield so you you can see
[52:47] all of these various multiple
[52:49] applications and various
[52:50] layers that are being fulfilled already
[52:53] have been
[52:53] in fulfillment and are continuing to
[52:55] unfold
[52:57] don't don't put everything off to the
[52:58] tribulation period friends the judgments
[53:01] of god are already falling
[53:04] brother branham that's thus saith the
[53:05] lord since 1964
[53:07] in the alaska earthquake the judgments
[53:10] begin
[53:11] pre-tribulation and won't let up and
[53:13] only are getting worse
[53:14] into the tribulation and then worse is
[53:16] an understatement
[53:18] you don't want to be here trust me i
[53:20] don't plan to be how about you
[53:24] so since that time and every day forward
[53:26] man has come up with new
[53:28] and inventive ways of sinning i heard
[53:30] brother matt speaking about it this
[53:31] morning those things from the tree of
[53:33] knowledge of good and evil and
[53:35] and and and how that brother branham
[53:37] then speaks to it again as i can find
[53:39] the next time
[53:41] in 1963 shortly after the opening of the
[53:44] seals he
[53:45] takes this this prophecy again
[53:48] in the flashing red light of the sign of
[53:50] his coming
[53:52] and in this passage brother branham
[53:55] doubles down on his interpretation
[53:57] and describes the gentile world now
[54:01] fully returned again to the days of noah
[54:04] and the days of lot
[54:05] and he's doubling down on that prophecy
[54:07] in 4-1 and he
[54:09] mentions that and he starts talking
[54:11] about the evidence of it
[54:12] is that we see the same things happening
[54:15] in the days of noah
[54:16] and that happened in the days of sodom
[54:18] and now we have a convergence
[54:20] and you're fighting it on two fronts see
[54:24] and then and then lastly as i can find
[54:27] um
[54:27] he mentions it again in 1964 the future
[54:31] home of the heavenly bridegroom
[54:33] and the earthly bride wherein he
[54:35] confirms
[54:36] that his worst fears have come to pass
[54:40] that the nation and the world are indeed
[54:44] doomed they cannot be saved that
[54:48] uh they're they're they're they're on a
[54:50] certain irreversible
[54:52] irrevocable path to destruction
[54:56] and no one's coming to save them or stop
[54:58] it
[54:59] and and and it's it's man is largely
[55:01] doing it to himself it's
[55:03] it was all to happen just before so
[55:06] brother branham now has this scripture
[55:09] seven women shall take a hold of one man
[55:11] and he's showing consistently
[55:14] prior to the seals prior to the nation
[55:16] crossing the line
[55:17] after the seals and he's showing that it
[55:20] was
[55:20] all happening just before the greatest
[55:23] moment
[55:24] in human history when god would finish
[55:27] this thing
[55:29] i'm glad he would take an elected bride
[55:32] elected gentile bride and and an elected
[55:35] jewish
[55:36] remnant and start a whole new oh
[55:38] millennium of
[55:39] peace and righteousness oh my what an
[55:43] hour that's going to be but of course
[55:46] now
[55:46] so this prophecy is also descriptive of
[55:49] israel
[55:51] just before her renewal the millennium
[55:54] which of course in the millennium will
[55:56] be a permanent
[55:58] renewal so the prophecy deals with that
[56:01] four thousand years
[56:03] for israel four thousand years of
[56:07] on again off again blessing and
[56:10] punishing
[56:11] will be over four thousand years of on
[56:14] again off again trials and tribulations
[56:17] it'll all be ended in that day shall the
[56:20] branch of the lord
[56:22] be beautiful and glorious
[56:25] look up friends your future is bright
[56:29] amen in the gospel transformation study
[56:33] notes the author picks this up and he
[56:36] says this one
[56:38] whose name is the branch will build the
[56:40] temple of the lord you know you can read
[56:42] that in zechariah 6
[56:43] and that's very very clear he said he
[56:46] will build the temple of the lord and as
[56:48] such
[56:48] he will bring renewal and shalom
[56:53] to the land and i just thought about
[56:55] that term
[56:57] shalom to the land and i just thought
[57:00] with thousands of
[57:02] recent hamas rockets i think they said
[57:05] above 4 000
[57:07] recent hamas rockets raining down on it
[57:10] and
[57:10] seemingly all the world turning against
[57:12] it even america even american jews
[57:17] then i i doubt this little track of
[57:19] promised land has
[57:21] ever appeared so the opposite
[57:25] of shalom to the land
[57:28] he goes on to say the result will be a
[57:30] changed people they will be holy
[57:33] for god shall have washed away their
[57:35] filth when god
[57:36] comes now listen as i found such
[57:38] affinity i so agreed with this statement
[57:41] when god comes and rescues how many have
[57:44] been rescued by him
[57:46] amen see if you haven't been rescued by
[57:49] him then you're doomed
[57:51] because you can't save yourself only he
[57:52] can save you
[57:54] and so he says when god comes and
[57:56] rescues now catch it i hope you agree
[57:59] i hope i'll get an amen he does not
[58:01] leave us
[58:02] as we are but purifies us
[58:05] and changes our lives don't call
[58:09] yourself a christian unless you have the
[58:11] life of christ living inside you
[58:16] see this grace of god
[58:20] finds full expression the author says
[58:23] in the work of christ and his spirit
[58:26] makes us
[58:27] new creatures his life living
[58:30] in and through us accomplishing
[58:34] our sanctification so
[58:38] god has rescued this bride today he has
[58:41] called you out
[58:43] of a doomed system called you out of
[58:45] doomed politics
[58:47] doomed ecumenical systems doomed social
[58:49] circles
[58:50] he's called you out of doomed uh of
[58:52] doomed entertainments and doomed
[58:54] recreation
[58:54] he's called you to life and to liberty
[58:58] and so i would say have liberty and the
[59:00] life
[59:01] that he gives see it literally produced
[59:05] a bride
[59:06] who in this hour is we understand that
[59:10] she's
[59:10] invisibly united with with the crucified
[59:14] and the risen lord jesus
[59:18] brother branham describes this
[59:20] prominently
[59:21] in the message all through the message
[59:23] he talks about
[59:24] that in that union that that oneness
[59:27] with christ and
[59:28] until he he can't even he can't hold it
[59:30] back anymore and finally he's got to
[59:31] preach a whole sermon called the
[59:33] invisible union
[59:34] of the heavenly bridegroom and the
[59:37] invisible union of the heavenly brigand
[59:38] and bride of christ
[59:40] the invisible union friends
[59:44] it was a message that god placed on his
[59:46] heart he wished it you know
[59:48] brother branham said i wish it was
[59:49] someone else's message to give
[59:52] people think that that the prophet took
[59:54] pleasure in
[59:55] in messages like the indictment and and
[59:58] god of the civil age or
[1:00:00] satan's eden and and uh you know
[1:00:03] i remember i remember one time i was
[1:00:06] working on a job and we were painting
[1:00:07] house dad and i
[1:00:08] and we used to always have to get there
[1:00:10] early quickly we had to beat the
[1:00:12] carpenters because they would always get
[1:00:14] there with their radios and they'd be
[1:00:15] playing hank williams or they'd be
[1:00:17] playing
[1:00:17] you know ac dc or whoever depends on
[1:00:20] what crew was there
[1:00:21] and so i would always get there really
[1:00:22] quick and get our big tape recorder out
[1:00:24] and put on brother branham so it'd be
[1:00:25] blasting everywhere
[1:00:27] and made them listen to preaching all
[1:00:28] day it was
[1:00:30] funny hey man i was just big enough they
[1:00:33] didn't try to defy me
[1:00:35] and so uh i remember one day i was in a
[1:00:37] working in the garage and the homeowner
[1:00:39] showed up she wanted to show she had her
[1:00:41] her friends with her to show the new
[1:00:43] remodel in the house
[1:00:44] and oh man i had brother branham i think
[1:00:47] i was playing something like satan's
[1:00:48] eden
[1:00:49] and he was just giving them the what for
[1:00:51] these women
[1:00:52] you women you know you bob of your hair
[1:00:55] you wear these tight clothes and
[1:00:57] hey you don't call yourself a christian
[1:00:59] you're not even a lady and you know he
[1:01:00] goes all back and forth
[1:01:02] and he's just letting them have it and
[1:01:04] and those women are kind of walking
[1:01:05] around looking in the garage and he's
[1:01:07] right there
[1:01:08] blasting them and i'm on the outside
[1:01:11] painting and i'm thinking brother
[1:01:12] brandon made me run off this job you may
[1:01:14] be run over this job
[1:01:16] and uh finally you know they they won't
[1:01:18] even they won't even look it's right
[1:01:20] there just cooking them and they're kind
[1:01:23] of going
[1:01:24] well maybe we should just move on and
[1:01:27] they kind of
[1:01:28] walked on in what are y'all staring at
[1:01:30] it's right there
[1:01:33] oh my what a day that was i remember
[1:01:36] that so clear
[1:01:37] but we didn't get fired we got to finish
[1:01:38] the job and we got paid
[1:01:40] amen and so uh and i wasn't uh
[1:01:45] though the worst brother eddie would
[1:01:46] take uh the van speaker and set it out
[1:01:49] on the window and just point it right at
[1:01:50] the house
[1:01:52] so you know i it was those were
[1:01:54] wonderful days
[1:01:56] but um but brother branham
[1:02:00] you know he he would say that he would
[1:02:02] say
[1:02:03] you know god he said i don't mean to
[1:02:04] offend people i'm not trying to be
[1:02:06] different
[1:02:08] this is a man who loved people and
[1:02:10] wanted
[1:02:11] unity and he said you know but god has
[1:02:13] given me
[1:02:14] a message and i must be honest and he
[1:02:17] said i wish it wasn't mine to give
[1:02:20] i wish somebody else had this burden see
[1:02:24] paul describes it see in in galatians 2
[1:02:28] 20
[1:02:28] i am crucified with christ nevertheless
[1:02:32] i live yet not i but christ
[1:02:35] liveth in me this is the invisible union
[1:02:39] you get me galatians 2 20
[1:02:42] is the invisible union i am crucified
[1:02:45] with christ
[1:02:46] nevertheless i live yet not i but christ
[1:02:49] liveth in me
[1:02:50] and the life which i now live in the
[1:02:52] flesh i
[1:02:53] live not not in not in the faith but
[1:02:57] by the faith not in the son of god but
[1:03:00] the faith of the son of god who loved me
[1:03:04] and gave himself for me i don't just
[1:03:06] have faith in him
[1:03:07] i have his faith i'm invisibly united
[1:03:11] and that's why
[1:03:11] when a message came in this day i'm
[1:03:14] sorry but it couldn't hold
[1:03:16] back it couldn't fail to declare
[1:03:19] and it could not shun to declare the
[1:03:22] whole council of god
[1:03:23] because this invisible union had to be
[1:03:26] restored
[1:03:27] i'm glad for a faithful messenger
[1:03:28] because i got restored
[1:03:30] and i'm invisibly united back with it
[1:03:33] again that's why i'm an oddball to the
[1:03:35] world
[1:03:36] that's why i don't fit
[1:03:40] if the opposite of that is true that's
[1:03:42] maybe why you do fit
[1:03:44] amen amen but if that's true
[1:03:48] that's why you don't fit all right
[1:03:53] so isaiah then is making it clear
[1:03:56] that god would bring what he determined
[1:04:00] for his chosen people to completion
[1:04:03] in the future god shall redeem israel
[1:04:07] friends i'm here to tell you we look for
[1:04:10] the rapture of the bride of christ but
[1:04:11] understand that
[1:04:13] you're an event on the way to an event
[1:04:16] that he's coming back for benjamin but
[1:04:19] he can't get the benjamin
[1:04:20] with you in the way so just like i've
[1:04:23] showed you about the
[1:04:24] the golf pro and i forget wherever who
[1:04:26] it was fuzzy zeller or palmer one of
[1:04:28] those guys
[1:04:29] okay somebody who could drive might have
[1:04:30] been jack who could drive it really long
[1:04:33] one of the old guys and they asked him
[1:04:35] said how do you drive the ball so far
[1:04:38] it's almost unheard of how do you do
[1:04:39] that he said because i'm not trying to
[1:04:41] drive the ball far
[1:04:43] he said i'm only trying to get a perfect
[1:04:44] swing the ball's just in the way
[1:04:49] he said so the ball's in my path of my
[1:04:51] perfect swing i'm telling you
[1:04:52] he's swinging for benjamin you're in the
[1:04:54] way you're in the path
[1:04:56] i just say swing away lord knock me
[1:04:58] right on out of here
[1:05:00] hallelujah i'm ready i'm ready to get on
[1:05:03] with the millennium friends
[1:05:04] i i you know my wife and i were talking
[1:05:06] about it yesterday i don't i'm not still
[1:05:08] not looking for a shortcut i don't want
[1:05:09] to leave with my job half
[1:05:11] done i that's that's not that
[1:05:14] i was taught better as a work ethic by
[1:05:16] my dad than that
[1:05:17] it doesn't matter it might be quitting
[1:05:19] time normally but we're so close to
[1:05:21] being done we're
[1:05:22] gonna stay and finish this thing i'm not
[1:05:23] coming back tomorrow for a little bitty
[1:05:25] 20 30 minute finish up we're gonna stay

[1:05:31] i want to be there
[1:05:33] but i i don't want to leave here till
[1:05:34] i'm done
[1:05:36] till i'm finished hallelujah and i
[1:05:38] believe we got more to do friends and we
[1:05:40] need to be up and at it we need to be
[1:05:42] about the father's business
[1:05:45] amen
[1:05:48] he's going to redeem israel and i
[1:05:50] believe that's going to be soon
[1:05:52] the will we find that the winds of
[1:05:56] war and winds of judgment have already
[1:05:58] begun a century ago
[1:06:00] under the first world wars
[1:06:03] and so we find here that you know among
[1:06:06] the gentile
[1:06:07] i mean just look at what has transpired
[1:06:10] in in history it's already history parts
[1:06:14] you know there's not a there's not i
[1:06:16] can't even find
[1:06:18] a bible teacher old or current
[1:06:22] that that that teaches anything other
[1:06:25] than
[1:06:26] the four horsemen of the of the book of
[1:06:30] revelation
[1:06:30] in chapter 6 are future for the
[1:06:33] tribulation
[1:06:35] and they're completely oblivious to
[1:06:38] that the first three have already
[1:06:41] happened
[1:06:42] and they're already history amen
[1:06:45] and they're oblivious to the fact that
[1:06:47] it's all the same writer
[1:06:49] and that the last pale one is the
[1:06:51] conglomeration of all the previous three
[1:06:54] and they don't realize that it's already
[1:06:57] brought them to their knees
[1:06:58] right in the churches until they have
[1:07:00] completely crucified
[1:07:03] for the second time christ the word
[1:07:06] and they've already been indicted amen
[1:07:10] there's already been a second
[1:07:12] crucifixion there's already been
[1:07:13] an indictment and the judgments have
[1:07:15] already begun to fall
[1:07:17] starting with a good friday earthquake
[1:07:20] paralleling matthew 27 flawlessly
[1:07:24] and the world must get worse and worse
[1:07:26] i'm not i'm not here today
[1:07:28] preaching a message of doom i'm
[1:07:29] preaching about god's goal
[1:07:31] that he purposed in christ i'm here
[1:07:33] preaching a love story
[1:07:35] amen
[1:07:38] so we find that the world must get
[1:07:42] worse and worse till jesus comes and
[1:07:45] takes it all back and i'll just ask you
[1:07:46] a question
[1:07:48] if the world is doomed and headed for a
[1:07:50] certain destruction and it's only
[1:07:52] getting worse and can't get better and
[1:07:54] must get worse
[1:07:55] and then jesus comes down and rescues
[1:07:57] you out of it that's not the greatest
[1:07:58] love story
[1:08:00] that you've ever heard i mean
[1:08:03] it's it's one thing if i got a fire in
[1:08:06] the fireplace
[1:08:07] and a fireman breaks in to drag me out
[1:08:08] of the house what are you doing
[1:08:10] but if my whole house is engulfed and
[1:08:12] i'm unconscious and he's dragging me out
[1:08:15] this man is important to me from going
[1:08:16] forward you see
[1:08:19] so we find that we're living
[1:08:22] in it now it's all happening around us
[1:08:24] in real time
[1:08:26] humanity has certainly lived out the
[1:08:28] words that brother branham
[1:08:29] said we're living right now in the
[1:08:31] fulfillment of things that he said like
[1:08:33] never before
[1:08:34] how the whole world would go insane
[1:08:36] we're there
[1:08:38] how it wouldn't even be safe i mean if
[1:08:39] you don't have the holy ghost friends
[1:08:41] it's not even
[1:08:42] you're not safe to walk down the street
[1:08:43] without a firearm
[1:08:45] see and and and and and then it's
[1:08:48] it the whole world has upside down and
[1:08:50] it's changed all of its laws and that
[1:08:52] and that's what the beast system was
[1:08:53] supposed to do
[1:08:55] see and so we find that the promise of
[1:08:58] christ is among us again
[1:09:01] with the full word which is such a
[1:09:04] comfort to me
[1:09:07] it's such a comfort to me to hear a
[1:09:09] prophet say
[1:09:11] we're only ripening we're only scouring
[1:09:14] for that last seed
[1:09:16] i'm not looking for another revival i'm
[1:09:18] looking for the coming of the lord
[1:09:20] that is so comforting to me i can face
[1:09:23] today
[1:09:24] and i can face however many more
[1:09:25] tomorrows there might be
[1:09:28] if there needs to be but
[1:09:31] but i can tell you friend that my sense
[1:09:33] of scale and my sense of comparison to
[1:09:35] prophecy tell me
[1:09:36] that it won't be long now i'm here to
[1:09:39] tell you
[1:09:40] it can't be long now what does your
[1:09:42] spiritual senses tell you
[1:09:46] see i'm not talking about your knowledge
[1:09:49] you better look deeper than that you
[1:09:51] better look deeper into your spiritual
[1:09:53] senses you know look look at the current
[1:09:57] level of your spiritual life let that be
[1:09:59] your barometer
[1:10:00] amen come on take some honest
[1:10:02] introspection today
[1:10:03] paul said let a man examine himself see
[1:10:07] when you come to the house of the lord
[1:10:09] and that'll tell you who
[1:10:11] you know and where more importantly
[1:10:12] where you really are
[1:10:14] and you know i i regret to have to say
[1:10:17] that some need their whole life awakened
[1:10:19] from a
[1:10:20] spiritual slumber you know you should
[1:10:23] pray that god grant it to you
[1:10:26] amen you should pray that god granted
[1:10:29] i spend time i spend time praying
[1:10:32] that he will grant it to you i spend
[1:10:35] time
[1:10:36] praying that he'll grant it to your
[1:10:37] families and to your children will you
[1:10:39] help me pray for you
[1:10:41] will you help me pray for you how i'd
[1:10:44] love to have somebody walk up to me
[1:10:45] after today
[1:10:46] maybe days to come and say brother jason
[1:10:48] i went home and i
[1:10:49] opened up my old prayer closet again and
[1:10:52] i'm helping you pray for me
[1:10:53] and i'm helping you pray for my children
[1:10:56] hallelujah oh i need your help friends
[1:11:01] i can't get us there all by myself i'm
[1:11:03] i'm fighting hard to this is an
[1:11:05] age where we need a full court press
[1:11:09] this is an age where we need all hands
[1:11:10] on deck everybody
[1:11:12] manning their battle stations everybody
[1:11:15] man your weapons today
[1:11:16] come on preachers deacons officers laity
[1:11:19] parents grandparents teenagers
[1:11:22] man your battle stations the war is on
[1:11:24] and we're right near the finish
[1:11:26] line friends hallelujah
[1:11:29] we're almost home isaiah's words assure
[1:11:35] that israel's destiny would be glorious
[1:11:39] the author finishes here in spite of
[1:11:43] intervening judgment you see joseph
[1:11:47] loved benjamin
[1:11:49] i mean he loved all of his brother they
[1:11:51] were his half brothers but benjamin was
[1:11:53] his full-blooded brother
[1:11:56] and his bowels his bowels mean his
[1:11:58] yearnings
[1:11:59] his his deepest feelings
[1:12:02] see and so he loved benjamin and
[1:12:05] you know god loved his gentile bride
[1:12:08] christ loved his gentile bride joseph
[1:12:10] loved his gentile bride that had been
[1:12:12] given to him by the king
[1:12:13] of egypt the pharaoh see and you know
[1:12:17] and so the bible tells us that those who
[1:12:19] were not his people
[1:12:21] became his people and were made his
[1:12:23] bride and i just thought about that i
[1:12:25] just thought wow was there ever
[1:12:27] was there ever a greater love story than
[1:12:29] this
[1:12:30] i mean ever ever a greater love story
[1:12:33] told among men
[1:12:36] can you think of a greater love story
[1:12:38] ever told among men
[1:12:40] than when god laid aside his crown
[1:12:44] laid aside the creator of the world and
[1:12:46] the universe laid aside
[1:12:48] everything and took upon him the form of
[1:12:51] a man
[1:12:52] and he absorbed every sin you've ever
[1:12:54] committed he absorbed every sin you
[1:12:56] would ever commit
[1:12:59] oh my a life that no one could take from
[1:13:03] him
[1:13:04] he freely did that they couldn't force
[1:13:06] him to do it
[1:13:07] you understand he freely did that was
[1:13:10] there ever
[1:13:11] a greater love story was there ever a
[1:13:13] greater love was there ever a greater
[1:13:15] lover
[1:13:16] than jesus christ was there ever a
[1:13:19] greater hero
[1:13:21] in any story any story you've read have
[1:13:24] you ever read
[1:13:24] a greater hero than this
[1:13:29] you should think about it friends he
[1:13:30] came at the price of blood
[1:13:34] he saved you at the cost of his own life
[1:13:38] think about that next time the devil
[1:13:40] tells you he's your buddy
[1:13:44] satan can't die for you wouldn't do him
[1:13:45] any good he wouldn't do it anyhow
[1:13:47] remember
[1:13:47] he wouldn't even redeem uh uh ruth
[1:13:51] wouldn't redeem her it would imperil his
[1:13:53] own
[1:13:54] heritage i'm glad that she got redeemed
[1:13:58] i'm glad boaz was there
[1:14:02] but he saved you at the cost of his own
[1:14:04] life his own creation
[1:14:07] would sell him out this is part of the
[1:14:10] love story
[1:14:12] this is part of the greatest story ever
[1:14:14] told
[1:14:15] his own creation his masterpiece
[1:14:18] would betray him the very work of his
[1:14:20] hands that turned on him david speaks
[1:14:23] about it i don't have time to get
[1:14:25] going down that line today you know his
[1:14:28] even
[1:14:28] even in the days of his human
[1:14:31] incarnation
[1:14:33] and the 70 left him
[1:14:36] well you know the 12 stayed with him and
[1:14:39] one of them was the devil
[1:14:41] and then that devil finally betrayed him
[1:14:43] in the garden of gethsemane
[1:14:45] you know and and the the 11 had stayed
[1:14:47] with him promised that they would stay
[1:14:49] with him forever
[1:14:50] but when it came to skin they all fled
[1:14:54] some of them jumped out of their clothes
[1:14:55] getting away
[1:14:57] ran off in the night half naked
[1:15:00] see
[1:15:03] peter followed him hurt his trial
[1:15:07] could see and hear
[1:15:10] that he was being falsely accused that
[1:15:14] witnesses were
[1:15:15] lying these witnesses were lying peter
[1:15:18] knew them
[1:15:19] you're lying he knew this was a
[1:15:22] religious
[1:15:23] kangaroo court he he
[1:15:27] he he i mean he he should have done he
[1:15:30] could have made some kind of move
[1:15:32] to defend him you know it it it
[1:15:35] i i i i'm so glad that that's why
[1:15:38] brother branham comes in this day and
[1:15:41] preaches a message called the trial
[1:15:43] and he says tonight i'm gonna give my
[1:15:46] lord a fair trial he didn't get a fair
[1:15:48] trial
[1:15:49] when he was here 2000 years ago tonight
[1:15:50] i'm going to give him a fair trial
[1:15:53] hallelujah that's the very series of
[1:15:55] meetings my dad was in a prayer line got
[1:15:57] my
[1:15:58] of my divine healing of an incurable
[1:15:59] disease during that series there in
[1:16:02] birmingham
[1:16:03] says i'm going to give my lord tonight a
[1:16:05] fair trial because he didn't get a fair
[1:16:07] trial
[1:16:08] you know what i found out at the end of
[1:16:09] that trial you know what i found well
[1:16:11] you know what you found out at the end
[1:16:12] of that trial
[1:16:13] he was innocent you know what we found
[1:16:15] out we were guilty
[1:16:17] he was innocent and he gave his life god
[1:16:20] traded the innocent
[1:16:21] for the guilty tell me that's not the
[1:16:23] greatest love story you ever heard
[1:16:26] tell me this one isn't worth serving and
[1:16:28] worth your life
[1:16:31] peter could have made a move my goodness
[1:16:34] he didn't defend him at all
[1:16:36] i mean gee he he could have it he could
[1:16:39] have at least organized a protest and
[1:16:42] organized marches and carried signs
[1:16:46] i mean he didn't even whisper around
[1:16:47] start a rumor mill
[1:16:51] he should have done anything but stand
[1:16:52] there and let it happen
[1:16:54] he he cursed and swore he didn't even
[1:16:56] know him
[1:16:58] you see every servant of god has failed
[1:17:00] him
[1:17:02] from the least to the greatest they've
[1:17:04] all failed him somewhere
[1:17:06] but oh my i'm here to tell you in jesus
[1:17:10] god had a servant that wouldn't fail him
[1:17:12] i'm so glad for election i'm so glad for
[1:17:15] election today
[1:17:17] oh he gave his life so that he could
[1:17:20] send it back upon his church and
[1:17:22] live inside of his people and seal them
[1:17:24] into safety until the day of your
[1:17:26] redemption imagine that
[1:17:28] lucky you you're sealed into safety
[1:17:31] until the day of your redemption and you
[1:17:34] won't you won't you won't give
[1:17:36] god make him the center of your life and
[1:17:38] you won't get him make him first
[1:17:40] you want to make him second and third
[1:17:43] and brother branham let me tell you
[1:17:44] william branham who knew him very well
[1:17:46] talked to him a lot he said he don't
[1:17:47] want to be second
[1:17:50] he don't want to be second he don't want
[1:17:52] to be
[1:17:53] jesus don't want to be second he paid
[1:17:56] too high a price
[1:17:58] for you to do him that way
[1:18:01] he wants to be first in your life
[1:18:07] what did the world do with the holy
[1:18:10] ghost that god sent them in the new
[1:18:11] testament
[1:18:13] isaiah says it right here seven women
[1:18:15] see here's
[1:18:16] all down through seven church ages a
[1:18:18] woman represents the church
[1:18:20] all down through seven women shall take
[1:18:23] a hold of one man
[1:18:24] saying we will eat our own bread and
[1:18:27] wear our own apparel
[1:18:29] only let us be called by thy name to
[1:18:31] take away our reproach you okay still
[1:18:33] with me
[1:18:35] only let us be called by thy name to
[1:18:38] take away our reproach
[1:18:41] seven women you know who
[1:18:46] seven church ages of humanity
[1:18:49] seven church ages of people who merely
[1:18:52] wanted his name but
[1:18:54] not a relationship amen i'd like to be
[1:18:57] called a christian
[1:18:59] in some circles it's vogue i'd like to
[1:19:00] be called i'm born again
[1:19:03] see they wanted to take his name but not
[1:19:06] really a relationship
[1:19:07] seven church ages that only wanted his
[1:19:10] blessing
[1:19:12] but never never willing to bring forth
[1:19:15] his seed
[1:19:17] that's that's why you have this
[1:19:20] this wasn't made this to stay this
[1:19:24] this will be finished someday and
[1:19:26] brother branham said when it's closed
[1:19:28] the last time why because this will be
[1:19:30] flesh
[1:19:32] this came like this to become this you
[1:19:36] understand
[1:19:36] this didn't he didn't give you this for
[1:19:38] memorization
[1:19:40] it's not a memory drill this came to
[1:19:42] live
[1:19:43] this is a seed this is impregnated with
[1:19:45] life if you feed on it and believe it
[1:19:47] and surrender to it you'll start being
[1:19:50] like this
[1:19:51] hallelujah that's why the message of the
[1:19:53] arcane that's why we have an invisible
[1:19:55] union
[1:19:56] that's why you're a believer that's why
[1:19:57] you're a christian and believe the
[1:19:58] message of the hour
[1:20:00] see don't be one who just wants his name
[1:20:02] only
[1:20:05] amen you're not supposed to take the
[1:20:07] name of the lord
[1:20:08] in vain you're not supposed to do that
[1:20:13] don't want his name only
[1:20:16] matt give me exodus 20 verse
[1:20:19] uh 7 down through
[1:20:24] 11 i think probably somewhere around in
[1:20:26] there
[1:20:27] thou shalt not take the name
[1:20:30] of the lord thy god in vain
[1:20:34] for the lord will not hold him guiltless
[1:20:36] that takes his name in vain
[1:20:37] now we're not just talking about sailor
[1:20:40] talk
[1:20:42] you get me not talking about you know
[1:20:45] cussing
[1:20:46] i'm talking about saying seven women
[1:20:49] taking a hold of one man and saying just
[1:20:52] give me your name
[1:20:53] i don't want a relationship i just want
[1:20:55] to be i just want to be
[1:20:56] named i don't want to bring forth your
[1:20:58] seed i don't want my life to be like
[1:21:00] your life i just want your name
[1:21:03] there's a there's social advantage i
[1:21:05] want to go to the mega church i want to
[1:21:07] i want to have my kids in their program
[1:21:09] i want to be part of that
[1:21:10] they got a nice food pantry they got a
[1:21:12] nice choir they got a nice televangelism
[1:21:14] they got it all over the world no no no
[1:21:16] no i'm not interested please
[1:21:18] give me somebody with itching ears i'll
[1:21:20] heap to myself teachers
[1:21:21] who just tell me what i want to hear
[1:21:23] don't really tell me what this says
[1:21:27] but thou shalt not take the name of the
[1:21:29] lord thy god in vain
[1:21:32] for the lord will not hold him guiltless
[1:21:34] that take his name in vain you remember
[1:21:37] in the in the ephesian age
[1:21:41] that the false church said they were the
[1:21:44] church they were the ecclesia
[1:21:47] god said okay fine if you're going to
[1:21:51] say
[1:21:51] that you're the church then i'm going to
[1:21:53] hold you responsible
[1:21:54] to be the church remember when jesus was
[1:21:57] there in the temple and they
[1:21:58] and he's telling about dead men's bones
[1:22:00] and men walk over you and they don't
[1:22:02] realize they're walking over
[1:22:03] graves and and these i don't remember if
[1:22:06] it's lawyers or pharisees or who it was
[1:22:08] and they said are are we dead also
[1:22:12] and jesus says well said that
[1:22:15] you know i'll just give it to you in in
[1:22:17] in in easy language
[1:22:19] you know if you actually were you know
[1:22:22] if you if you actually
[1:22:24] were just in ignorance then
[1:22:27] you you'd have some kind of excuse to
[1:22:28] give god at least
[1:22:30] you could at least plead ignorance but
[1:22:32] since you say
[1:22:34] we see your guilt remains
[1:22:38] because you may you take the name of the
[1:22:40] lord and you take it in vain
[1:22:42] you're not supposed to do that seven
[1:22:44] women shall take a hold of one man
[1:22:46] at the end time at the end of seven ages
[1:22:48] that's been happening for two thousand
[1:22:50] years
[1:22:50] and it was it's come to full fruition in
[1:22:53] this hour listen friends don't don't
[1:22:54] lose that
[1:22:56] that's why we've had 266
[1:22:59] popes that's why there's 1.2 billion
[1:23:02] roman catholics
[1:23:03] that's why there's 2 billion protestants
[1:23:05] that's why there's a staggering global
[1:23:08] 45 000 denominations
[1:23:11] why because through seven ages they only
[1:23:14] took his name and never wanted to bring
[1:23:16] forth his life
[1:23:17] but you're not supposed to take the name
[1:23:19] of the lord thy god in vain
[1:23:23] verse 8 son remember the sabbath day
[1:23:27] what is the sabbath day the holy ghost
[1:23:31] remember don't take the name of the lord
[1:23:33] in vain because the holy ghost is a
[1:23:35] sabbath it's a rest it's a holy day it's
[1:23:38] a holy thing
[1:23:40] you don't just take my name you become
[1:23:43] you allow me to it to to impregnate you
[1:23:47] with
[1:23:47] my seed so that you can bring forth a
[1:23:51] child like mary did
[1:23:54] you bring forth his life living through
[1:23:56] your life
[1:23:57] don't take the name of the lord thy god
[1:24:02] in vain i give it to you in kentucky
[1:24:04] language if you're not going to live
[1:24:06] like a christian
[1:24:08] said a kentucky prophet stop calling
[1:24:10] yourself a christian
[1:24:12] because you only bring a reproach
[1:24:16] i tell you something friends that is
[1:24:19] against every
[1:24:20] fiber of my being to try to claim i'm
[1:24:24] something that i'm not
[1:24:26] i'd rather just go out and eat drink and
[1:24:28] be merry for tomorrow i die
[1:24:30] i'm not here to be a fake christian or a
[1:24:33] fake believer i'm not here to be an
[1:24:36] underachiever that
[1:24:37] grinds on me more than any other
[1:24:40] weakness in my life
[1:24:42] is to underachieve and i say lord god
[1:24:44] forgive me i pray it daily
[1:24:46] help me to let let this day be a more
[1:24:48] success than the day before
[1:24:50] let me charge for it let me be more i
[1:24:52] want to be more
[1:24:53] not just do more remember i want to be
[1:24:56] more
[1:24:59] verse 9 six days shalt thou
[1:25:03] labor and do all thy work see so
[1:25:06] so so i leave it right there so i
[1:25:09] i hope you're hearing the voice of god
[1:25:13] today i don't talk about my voice
[1:25:14] i'm not talking about it on a screen i'm
[1:25:16] talking about in your soul today
[1:25:18] i hope you're hearing the voice of god
[1:25:21] you know
[1:25:22] hear the lord calling to you
[1:25:25] from his word today and he's saying to
[1:25:28] you
[1:25:29] you have a life see in in in view of
[1:25:32] verse 9
[1:25:33] 6 days thou shalt labor the lord gives
[1:25:36] you a life
[1:25:37] he gives you a life you understand you
[1:25:40] have a life
[1:25:42] and you are to live in this world but
[1:25:44] you aren't given this life to abuse it
[1:25:46] in this world as paul taught us you
[1:25:49] don't abuse it you're here you can't get
[1:25:51] out of here you can't escape it
[1:25:53] paul had wrote to them in his first
[1:25:54] letter you know you need to be separate
[1:25:56] from the world and they wrote him back
[1:25:57] paul gee how do we i mean we have jobs
[1:25:59] and careers we're in school we have
[1:26:00] families
[1:26:01] we're in the market what do you mean
[1:26:03] well you want us to build a community
[1:26:04] paul says no no he writes back in the
[1:26:06] second letter and clears it no i didn't
[1:26:08] mean that
[1:26:09] because in order to in order to be
[1:26:10] completely separate you just have to go
[1:26:12] out of the world
[1:26:13] because no matter where you go you go
[1:26:15] out and live with the indians there's
[1:26:16] bad indians live in the wilderness
[1:26:17] there's still demons out there
[1:26:19] you understand so he's saying i didn't
[1:26:22] mean you know you'd have to leave the
[1:26:23] world but what i'm saying to you is
[1:26:25] you do live here but understand you're
[1:26:27] not from here
[1:26:29] you're in the world you're not of the
[1:26:30] world see you you have life in the world
[1:26:33] six days thou shalt labor i give it to
[1:26:35] you
[1:26:36] and do all thy work so in other words
[1:26:39] have your life but but don't forget that
[1:26:42] you're
[1:26:42] you're called to a rest also
[1:26:47] you're not just here for your life do
[1:26:48] you hear his voice calling to you today
[1:26:51] see son daughter
[1:26:54] don't you know that you're the temple
[1:26:57] of my dwelling place i'm in here too
[1:27:02] so don't live your whole life just with
[1:27:04] your six days of life
[1:27:05] there's a sabbath there's another day
[1:27:08] there's a
[1:27:08] there's a holy ghost that you should
[1:27:10] live by
[1:27:12] see
[1:27:16] i hope you hear his voice calling today
[1:27:20] i gave you six days
[1:27:24] you can't give me one amen
[1:27:28] i give you six days you can't give me
[1:27:30] one
[1:27:32] one i mean some people can't even give
[1:27:34] him one out of six days to come to
[1:27:36] church
[1:27:37] they don't give him one out of six and
[1:27:40] he gives them
[1:27:41] everything all
[1:27:44] good things and gifts come down from
[1:27:47] the father above in whom is no
[1:27:50] variableness no
[1:27:51] shadow of turning all good gifts come
[1:27:54] down from him any good gift you've got
[1:27:56] in your life he gave you
[1:27:59] and he says i give you life and i give
[1:28:00] you blessing and i give you six days to
[1:28:03] live
[1:28:03] i give you you know almost you know but
[1:28:06] hey i
[1:28:06] i live in there too see
[1:28:10] don't you know that that i'm in you
[1:28:12] because i
[1:28:13] you're my temple so that i can have an
[1:28:15] expression through you that's why i'm in
[1:28:17] you
[1:28:18] don't take my name in vain i'm here for
[1:28:20] a reason there's a
[1:28:21] sabbath there's a rest there's a holy
[1:28:24] ghost
[1:28:25] see verse 10. but the seventh day is the
[1:28:30] sabbath of the lord thy god
[1:28:33] in it thou shalt not do any work
[1:28:38] so don't make your life
[1:28:42] about only your life
[1:28:47] don't take the name of the lord
[1:28:51] in vain don't make your life
[1:28:54] only about your life the seventh day
[1:28:58] is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it
[1:29:02] thou
[1:29:02] shalt not do any work see thou
[1:29:06] nor thy son nor thy daughter so don't
[1:29:10] don't run your family in a way that does
[1:29:13] that
[1:29:15] don't teach that to your children by
[1:29:17] your way of living like that
[1:29:20] because you're training them that life's
[1:29:22] about this life and life's not about
[1:29:23] this life
[1:29:24] life's about the next one coming
[1:29:26] hallelujah
[1:29:27] amen oh come on don't get quiet on me
[1:29:29] friends
[1:29:30] just because we turned a little bit
[1:29:32] inward
[1:29:34] you know see thy manservant nor
[1:29:38] thy maidservant nor thy cattle so even
[1:29:41] your business and all your blessings
[1:29:43] that come down to you from above
[1:29:45] they should openly this is what god is
[1:29:48] saying your life
[1:29:49] and your business and your family and
[1:29:51] everything that has to do with living
[1:29:53] it should bring me glory and his people
[1:29:56] should recognize
[1:29:57] my presence inside you amen
[1:30:02] and when you live in a way that doesn't
[1:30:05] bring me
[1:30:06] glory and people don't know my presence
[1:30:08] is there and i'm just sitting in there
[1:30:09] twiddling my thumbs because you won't
[1:30:11] give me expression
[1:30:14] amen say amen oh my old me something
[1:30:22] god is saying that to you today friends
[1:30:24] i hope you're catching it
[1:30:26] i'm the god who gives you these things
[1:30:29] i'm the god who makes you successful
[1:30:32] amen
[1:30:32] i'm the god who saved you from doom i'm
[1:30:35] the god who rescued you i'm the god
[1:30:37] who's going to make you beautiful in the
[1:30:38] world to come
[1:30:41] see so he says thy
[1:30:44] thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor
[1:30:48] thy
[1:30:48] cattle i mean friends even the saints of
[1:30:50] god's family who are
[1:30:52] who are so journeying here with you
[1:30:54] struggling
[1:30:55] struggling along with you are we all in
[1:30:57] this together
[1:30:58] and we're all struggling this together
[1:31:00] even they should be able to find in you
[1:31:03] are refreshing
[1:31:04] amen amen oh lord i'm about to switch
[1:31:08] gears everybody locking up on me
[1:31:11] they should be able to find a refreshing
[1:31:13] this is this
[1:31:14] is part of why we assembled this part of
[1:31:16] why we open the doors
[1:31:17] see you're hearing a trumpet sound
[1:31:20] when those doors open it's not about a
[1:31:23] church schedule
[1:31:24] you're hearing a trumpet sound you're
[1:31:26] being called to the master's table
[1:31:29] you're being called to a feast this is a
[1:31:30] feast day
[1:31:34] a feast day see
[1:31:37] i give you six days but i have a seventh
[1:31:40] and that's a sabbath
[1:31:42] hallelujah oh my
[1:31:45] it's a spiritual feast it's a holy
[1:31:47] convocation
[1:31:48] this is why paul says in first
[1:31:50] corinthians 5.
[1:31:52] beginning verse 7 christ our passover is
[1:31:55] sacrificed for us verse 8
[1:31:57] therefore let us keep the feast not with
[1:32:01] old leaven
[1:32:02] neither with the leaven of malice and
[1:32:04] wickedness but with the unleavened bread
[1:32:07] of sincerity and truth
[1:32:10] see so thy manservant a maid servant
[1:32:14] i cattle nor nor the last part of verse
[1:32:17] 10 back in
[1:32:19] exodus 20 last part of verse 10 nor thy
[1:32:22] stranger that is within thy gates
[1:32:27] see so so your public testimony should
[1:32:31] reflect
[1:32:32] his presence in your life
[1:32:36] listen this is to the old and young
[1:32:37] married or single
[1:32:39] teenagers parents grandparents
[1:32:42] officers preachers your your your
[1:32:46] your everything should be done
[1:32:50] so that it brings him glory
[1:32:53] so that people see
[1:32:56] your public testimony that your public
[1:32:59] testimony declares his presence in your
[1:33:01] life
[1:33:02] not not merely teaching not merely
[1:33:05] doctrine that don't win no body
[1:33:09] but his presence should is what should
[1:33:12] be recognized
[1:33:14] in your life verse 11 for in six days
[1:33:18] the lord made heaven and earth the sea
[1:33:22] and all and all that in them
[1:33:25] is everybody say all and
[1:33:28] all that in them is and rested the
[1:33:30] seventh day
[1:33:31] wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath
[1:33:33] day and
[1:33:34] hallowed it see
[1:33:38] so we don't we don't take his name
[1:33:41] vainly
[1:33:43] that's not why he saved you this is the
[1:33:46] greatest love story ever told
[1:33:49] we're living in a world that betrayed
[1:33:51] him
[1:33:52] and even every servant betrayed him yet
[1:33:55] he you know
[1:33:56] he he made a promise through david and
[1:33:58] david fell horribly it
[1:33:59] jesus still came the promise still
[1:34:02] happened
[1:34:03] see i'm that's why paul said nothing can
[1:34:05] separate me from the love of god
[1:34:07] not heighten or death nor apparel famine
[1:34:10] sword anything
[1:34:11] not even me can separate me see
[1:34:14] so how many are willing today to help me
[1:34:17] pray for you
[1:34:19] help me pray for your children help me
[1:34:21] pray for your business help me pray
[1:34:23] we're trying to get us all home friends
[1:34:25] and this you're living in the hour
[1:34:29] of the culmination the complete zenith
[1:34:31] the complete apex
[1:34:34] of that prophecy at the end of seven
[1:34:37] ages
[1:34:38] you've got a pale horse rider ready to
[1:34:40] ride you've got a flying
[1:34:42] eagle anointing anointing a bride
[1:34:44] anointing a bride to do what
[1:34:46] shalom anointing a bride to be invisibly
[1:34:50] united with christ
[1:34:51] anointing a bride so that her life so
[1:34:54] that his life
[1:34:55] in her life can live out through her
[1:34:57] life
[1:34:58] is that the desire of your heart see
[1:35:01] that's
[1:35:02] that was his desire when he
[1:35:05] you remember brother branham tells one
[1:35:07] of the i'm going to close with this
[1:35:10] you and it's familiar to you i won't
[1:35:13] even
[1:35:13] bother reading the quotes on it but
[1:35:16] brother branham tells the story
[1:35:19] of the rancher member the armor packing
[1:35:23] and the son who went out west and he
[1:35:26] left the east because he
[1:35:28] he couldn't find anything but fake women
[1:35:30] and he wanted to go out to the prairies
[1:35:31] and
[1:35:32] find him a uh a wilderness girl
[1:35:35] who was and brother branham said he
[1:35:37] wanted to find a real
[1:35:39] a real woman see he wanted brother
[1:35:41] brandon talks about how that
[1:35:44] you know he he comes out there i love
[1:35:46] reading that story man
[1:35:47] because it's so romantic and it's so
[1:35:50] adventuresome and it's so
[1:35:52] you know and how that you remember how
[1:35:54] that he he noticed her
[1:35:56] and she didn't know he was watching and
[1:35:58] she was like cinderella
[1:36:00] you know all she all the evil
[1:36:01] stepsisters had made her the slave
[1:36:02] remember she was a cousin
[1:36:05] and uh and all those other ones remember
[1:36:07] all the other cousins and they were
[1:36:08] brother graham said they were all trying
[1:36:09] to vamp him and
[1:36:10] they were all trying to you know impress
[1:36:12] him through you know
[1:36:13] tight-fitting clothes and and too much
[1:36:16] cleavage and a lot a ton of makeup and
[1:36:18] but he had already seen that he didn't
[1:36:19] want that that's why he was there
[1:36:21] he wanted he wanted a holy girl he
[1:36:24] wanted somebody pure who would be a real
[1:36:26] mother a real
[1:36:26] mother to his children a real wife who

[1:39:21] verse 2 isaiah 4 verse 2 and 3.
[1:39:26] here is god's goal
[1:39:29] that was purposed in christ
[1:39:32] in that day shall the branch of the lord
[1:39:36] be beautiful and glorious
[1:39:39] and the fruit of the earth shall be
[1:39:41] excellent and calmly for them that are
[1:39:43] escaped of israel
[1:39:44] and it shall come to pass that he that
[1:39:48] is left in zion and he
[1:39:50] that remaineth in jerusalem shall be
[1:39:52] called holy even
[1:39:54] every one that is written among the
[1:39:57] living
[1:39:57] in jerusalem this is the eternal aim of
[1:40:01] god
[1:40:02] in all of it so i'm finishing where i
[1:40:04] started today i'm coming back full
[1:40:06] circle
[1:40:07] this is god's goal to bring you to
[1:40:10] something
[1:40:10] where brother brown said someday you
[1:40:12] you're here you hear the preaching
[1:40:14] you're hearing the service you feel the
[1:40:16] anointing god blesses your life
[1:40:18] something good happens you get a little
[1:40:19] taste he said you think it's so good
[1:40:21] he said someday he and that word
[1:40:25] will become what you never dreamed
[1:40:26] possible
[1:40:29] that's what we're headed for friends
[1:40:31] that's why i serve it because it's a
[1:40:32] living
[1:40:34] gospel let's stand brother matt bring
[1:40:36] your t i'm sorry brother bradley bring
[1:40:38] your team back
[1:40:39] amen this morning praise the lord
[1:40:42] amen wow that's thank god i feel
[1:40:45] completed
[1:40:46] praise the lord i actually had another
[1:40:48] sermon i wanted to preach i was driving
[1:40:49] this morning
[1:40:50] telling my wife i said i'm really
[1:40:52] looking forward to my material today but
[1:40:53] boy do i wish i could preach something
[1:40:55] different she's like
[1:40:56] wait what what what and i said well i'm
[1:41:00] gonna enjoy this i've been working on it
[1:41:01] i said but wow
[1:41:03] i've got another thought burning on my
[1:41:04] heart but
[1:41:06] i pledged the lord many years ago when i
[1:41:08] just uh just started not ministering i'd
[1:41:09] never do that i'd never pick and choose
[1:41:12] what to preach i would always go with
[1:41:13] what he told me and never position it to
[1:41:16] where i thought that
[1:41:17] you know i want to is what i want to
[1:41:18] preach no
[1:41:20] and i've never broke that never
[1:41:22] knowingly but jack my whole life
[1:41:24] never knowingly since the day i started
[1:41:26] very early i was preaching a year or two
[1:41:28] and uh and i had one of those situations
[1:41:31] where you hear me
[1:41:32] talk about how well i was coming to
[1:41:34] remember church i
[1:41:35] i'll say i was coming to church i had a
[1:41:37] sermon i got hijacked on the way
[1:41:38] and so we're going to preach something
[1:41:39] different today this is one of those the
[1:41:41] first time that ever happened to me and
[1:41:42] thank goodness it don't happen often
[1:41:44] because it's unnerving and i was i
[1:41:46] wasn't even at my home church
[1:41:49] yeah i was at i was at uh i was in
[1:41:51] colombia
[1:41:52] and i was at benny perry's church first
[1:41:54] time i'd ever preached i've been
[1:41:55] preaching maybe a year
[1:41:56] and i was in the back and they were
[1:41:58] getting ready to call me out
[1:42:00] and i had my had my sunday morning notes
[1:42:02] my sunday night notes ready to go
[1:42:04] and i'm just ready to walk out the door
[1:42:05] and the lord says you're going to flip
[1:42:07] that
[1:42:08] and i said flip what you're going to
[1:42:10] preach sunday nights
[1:42:11] this morning and this morning's tonight
[1:42:14] and i almost didn't do it
[1:42:16] and i just said lord ah you know for me
[1:42:18] it's all about preparation
[1:42:20] and but then i remembered i could hear
[1:42:23] it playing in my head i'm gonna hear it
[1:42:25] tell you something friends let me give a
[1:42:26] piece of advice
[1:42:27] this has served me there are several
[1:42:29] statements
[1:42:31] that i i've been listening to tapes
[1:42:32] since uh like
[1:42:34] my earliest memory as a little child
[1:42:37] my mom wore out multiple reel-to-reel
[1:42:40] recorders
[1:42:41] the whole neighborhood got to hear
[1:42:42] brother brandon
[1:42:44] she played them around as soon as one
[1:42:46] would stop she'd thread through another
[1:42:48] and wind it up and the way we would go
[1:42:50] and and and so you remember certain
[1:42:53] statements that brother branham would
[1:42:54] make and they become almost like a
[1:42:56] hallmark
[1:42:56] almost like an ancient landmark in your
[1:42:58] mind
[1:43:00] and i could hear bro and this one has
[1:43:02] served me well many times i can hear
[1:43:04] brother branham saying
[1:43:05] he's telling a story and and he was a
[1:43:07] little bit questioned
[1:43:08] about it he said and he said like this
[1:43:10] he said but i knew better than to
[1:43:11] disobey that voice
[1:43:13] brother jack that served me at that
[1:43:15] moment i was just a young preacher and i
[1:43:17] was
[1:43:17] really not wanting to do that but i
[1:43:19] heard that it come back
[1:43:21] see jesus said what i do now you don't
[1:43:24] know but you'll know her after the holy
[1:43:25] spirit will bring it back
[1:43:26] and i can hear brother random saying but
[1:43:28] i knew better than to disobey that voice
[1:43:30] and i said
[1:43:30] okay we'll flip it oh my
[1:43:34] and sin i said lord help me never and to
[1:43:37] this day
[1:43:38] 30 years later in ministry i've never
[1:43:41] that i know of never knowingly broke
[1:43:43] that promise to the lord
[1:43:45] i've been tempted to several times but
[1:43:47] never
[1:43:48] never have i let that go it's been good
[1:43:50] to be in the house of god today
[1:43:52] i'm gonna say something i said in a long
[1:43:54] time if you want to
[1:43:56] turn around shake hands with somebody
