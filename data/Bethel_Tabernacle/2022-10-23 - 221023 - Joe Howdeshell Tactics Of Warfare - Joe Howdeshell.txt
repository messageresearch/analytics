[Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] thank you foreign [Music] man we're happy to be here and I wanted to just open the service and make a few announcements amen as we just get started here today I want to welcome um see that better wait till they're in here I don't see sister mom and her family in here yet but another I think okay here here they come in here no that's actually not sister Gene that's my Aunt Connie who only looks like my sister it looks like such a team and that's her daughter Deborah and um and uh who there's someone else here is it your daughter oh yeah oh yeah Rachel's sitting right here behind the how to shells amen happy to have them here today also uh sister Jean's neighbor Sister Evelyn with us again I just saw her looking right at her oh she's sitting right there sister yeah God bless you yeah you almost have to jump up and down to get my attention amen happy to have her here as well again in the house of the Lord with us amen sisters yeah okay praise the Lord God bless you don't know who this is but praise the Lord we're happy to have you here today also Sister Sarah King and the family is here Sister Sarah Turner flip jump run she's not in the sanctuary just yet but we're happy to have her in she's been in town she's going to be working helping with the camp and she brought her a tribe along to go to the camp so we're happy to have all of them here with us sister Sarah's home folk amen there she comes amen praise the Lord everybody turn around and stare at her right there so we're happy to have her here today amen with us as well um I want to make just a few quick announcements before we turn brother Tony loose because once you turn him loose there ain't no stopping him amen but um there our midweek service for this coming week will be on Tuesday as opposed to our normal Wednesday service the reason being is because so many of our team members will be gone headed to the camp to get set up that's such a herculin effort that it takes over there and it's a it's a big event and so this is only our second annual camp I thought our first one was smashing in its success the Lord blessed it mightily and so uh this is our second annual camp and so so many will be gone on Wednesday we're going to hold the midweek service on Tuesday and I'd like to be able to at the end of the service maybe gather everybody kind of in the old way of the way we used to do it before pandemic kind of gave us pause on that but um amen we might as I have to go back to that somebody mentioned it to me recently I remember who now who it was saying my goodness let's go back was that you Caleb somebody mentioned it to me said man we need to go back and start gathering around the front again and it's like yeah you got my vote man but the we would have never stopped it but the planned demonic stopped it and uh amen but we're not going to give credit to the devil so we enjoy gathering around and so we're going to do that this Tuesday night to pray for our young people that the Lord will come on the scene mightily amen so quite naturally you can imagine brother Jason would certainly be expecting all of the parents Amen to be involved in that this this coming Tuesday night but it's a regular service come one come all and the there will be no live service here next Sunday on the 30th the camp services all of them should be live streaming we have the the stuff set up for that and we should be having a good even a better one than we had last year last year it wasn't all that great but we've added some equipment hopefully that'll come out better this year I will be posting myself or brother Matt will be posting a link to the Bethel Tabernacle WhatsApp chat for the live streaming of the entire Camp I would encourage everyone to hear it and be a partaker of it amen not just a a spectator but a partaker amen so we're looking forward to that um Brother Brad submitted a praise report today to praise to our lord for helping Rebecca and I find a nice place to live helping us through the transition we were all praying with them amen you remember that God answers prayer friends my goodness you start praying prayer this changes everything amen and uh says we found a nice place in helping us through the transition God be praised and just want to say how much I appreciate our ministry in Beaufort me too amen praise the name of the Lord I want to give you a quick just a quick brief update on our current where we are in the building phase now as you know we finished phase one I think it looks amazing and uh phase two has been underway for a little while now brother Kenny was actually going to give a presentation today but we couldn't get that together we didn't have enough information for that but what I would just like to kind of put as a as a thought in your mind is that there has been activity going on behind the scenes almost like it's almost like the silence under the seventh seal there's a that you don't look like A lot's going on but A lot's happening behind the scenes amen and uh but this is this is the uh The Unsung Parts where all the brothers are working behind the scenes and there's planning there's plans there's meetings with the city which we've had there's permits that have to be gotten there's there's drawings there's architectural there's engineering stamps and this all has to go about and then you you have to you just have to go at the pace that you can and I just want you to know lest you think nothing's been happening uh quite a bit has actually already been accomplished and we've also been saving money the trustees felt like that they wanted to get at least to the fifty thousand dollar range before we start that's not going to build our second phase but I have every confidence that once we get once the people start seeing that again then a spirit to give you're already been giving it's been accumulating and all of your stuff that you send in weekly has been uh you know inching it up and up and up and we should have that threshold met in fact as we're probably there now and so that's enough to get us started but we're still working on uh some plans and some engineering and and the permits from the city so just keep that in prayer that the Lord will uh you know keep that moving forward it is going forward so I just want to make that announcement to you now I want to come to another announcement my final announcement I'm not going to minister today we have brother Joe how to show who's going to carry the service for us today and um I had a little bit of a troubling symptom this morning as you all know the history that I've dealt with uh with a heart situation I feel perfectly fine it was just a mild symptom and I did a a an ECG on my on my watch which sister Meredith and brother Andrew felt just enough caution with the accompanying symptom which was really just heartburn and the reason that's a symptom for me is because I don't I don't ever get heartburn ever and so I indigestion and that's a different thing that's that was The Telltale sign when I first started having problems that is not back I haven't had that all is good I'm exercising fine I have no problem with it whatsoever but this morning I had a terrible bout of the of heartburn and I couldn't get it to stop and that's what was alarming and then they looked at the ECG and said and that's only one lead because a watch has technically Savvy as it is is only one lead so they recommended I go to get a 12 lead I did I went right to the fire department right behind my house they took me right in EMTs and everything was normal that said everything looked good and there there was no nothing that concerned them at all brother Andrew conferred with the they actually knew each other the EMT and they conferred and they said nothing jumped out at them at all everything looked good brother Andrew's words where it looks very good so I feel perfectly fine but just as a as a matter of caution and as a better part of wisdom they both recommended that I not Minister today and get through the weekend take it easy maybe the Lord knew I just need needed some more rest I have been very tired and been going just almost at a supernatural Pace this entire year and it's been quite unusual to me I will assure you I promise you I've only taken the meetings that I've felt leded to take and I have disregarded many other invitations but then we've I've also had a lot of of unscheduled stuff tucked in I've had to leave town and go preach funerals I've had to leave town and for my wife's parents and and we just got back from that and so you know there's probably been a half a dozen unscheduled trips tucked in between all of the many scheduled meetings that I've taken this year haven't taken so many since my days of evangelizing amen and so it's uh it's caught up to me maybe the Lord knew I needed to rest today maybe it's all of the above maybe brother Joe's got something and I'm going to be listening for What the Lord Has for me today now you need to take that as a personal challenge to say Lord what do you have for me today because I know that there are no accidents there are only God sentence amen and so we're looking forward to that today so I'm going to be right here on the platform pulling hard amen and uh me and brother Luther we get a we get an echo of amen's going and then and then brother Joe comes over here in his shouting corner and brother Charles and different ones of y'all some of y'all are are more loud than others and I wish all of you were more loud than each other amen so amen I love to a good pull on the word of God and I just wanted to say that to you personally so you can see that I am totally fine feel perfectly fine uh and this is just kind of uh taking a better safe than sorry but the Lord knows all about it amen so God bless you today Amen brother Anthony come lead us amen praise the Lord Brother God bless you yeah [Music] how many happy to be in the house of the Lord amen amen let's stand and sing this is my

the most privileged people on the face of this Earth you know the whole world is just a desert they don't know which way to turn they've got bombs in the hangers with the fueled up ready to go Jets on the runways and ships out in the ocean the whole world seems like it's going insane [Music] but I'm so glad that we have an oasis that we can run to Amen in a dry and desert land amen do you know that song sister oh God he's my Oasis you're my Oasis I'll just try to sing it acapella and y'all just jump in try give me a d Maybe [Music] oh God you're my Oasis and in dry places you make flowers grow

is Living Waters for one more time oh God foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm so glad this morning we haven't Oasis amen if you have your Bibles while you're standing we'll go ahead and read a verse of scripture Matthew chapter 16. verse we'll just start with verse uh 16. Matthew chapter 16 verse 16. and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art to Christ the son of the Living God this was the answer to the question that Jesus gave him who do men say that I am some say you're John the Baptist Elias and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church in the gates of hell shall not Prevail against it let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord as we stand here so thankful Lord for your blessings and thanking you Lord that we're here for another opportunity Lord to stand and to minister to your people Lord the precious purchase of your blood Lord as Lord So Unworthy Lord of anything that you would give us Lord but we stand here father with open arms and Open Hearts Lord ready to receive your word o God and Lord let it not just come into US Lord but flow through us oh God come in and grow Lord that we can Proclaim this gospel to others Lord and show it to our brothers and sisters father in Jesus name we pray amen you can be seated now just as a little uh Foundation here and I wanted to read this scripture because what many people think that the church uh the Catholic church was built upon Peter because it says in Thou Art Peter but we know that Jesus wasn't saying the church is built on a man but when you ask him who do you who do men say that I am he said you are the Christ the son of the Living God he said Upon This Rock the revelation of who Jesus Christ is that's where I'll build my church see it's the Revelation and so that's the very Foundation we have to go all the way back to the very Foundation if you want to start off right so now Jesus is telling Peter he says and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it now I don't know about you and the and the the title of this sermon this morning is the tactics of warfare all right but I've never seen a gate ever attack anybody a gate is a fortification yeah so what is Jesus referring to when he's talking to Peter here that the Gates of Hell won't Prevail against you or it won't Prevail against this revelation see so what is the gates of hell all right so in our bodies in our lives and and all that we have our strongholds that that when we're born again of the spirit of God the Holy Spirit comes in and our life is changed but there's a little bit of something that's left in there now why don't we turn to Second Corinthians 10 and we'll read about what Paul says here now I Paul beseech myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who in presence and base among you but being absent and bold toward you but I beseech you that I may not be bold when I'm present with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold against some which think up to us we walked according to the flesh for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds see now when he says that the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal that means it's not psychology you can't get a self-help book to make you better it might make you a better citizen or a better Democrat or a debt a better Republican or whatever it will be but it's not going to pull down those strongholds in your life there's only one thing that'll do that as the weapons that God has provided for you this day they're not carnal and also the strongholds are not your brother and sister amen we don't try to tear down one another we try to build each other up [Applause] amen as Paul was saying I may not be bold when I don't want to I don't want to come and do these things with confidence we're with that thing to be bold against some which think of as we walked according to flesh for though we walk in the flesh we don't war after the flesh what he's saying we had to live in these bodies in these pest houses that we have oh we don't live according to the Flesh of this world we've got a an answer this morning oh my God we've got an empty grave that we can look to [Music] Because He Lives now we have an oasis amen that we can run to get a Cool Drink of Water amen now we want to talk about that how that and all right let's go ahead in Ephesians 6 and I'm just going to cover this right fast and we'll we'll go ahead and read that one Ephesians 6 10. keep your Bibles in your laps this morning did you bring your sword with you [Applause] [Laughter] oh my we don't go into battle without a sword do we amen this is your weapon this morning amen we're gonna find out exactly what the what weapons that we need finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that he may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand therefore having your loins go to about with truth we ought to have the truth you can't walk in there you've got to have the truth that's the foundation you can have all kind of ideas about things feel good stories or whatever but you better have the truth and that's something that's something that is so they can't even nail down what truth is anymore I can't even tell you what a man and a woman is anymore I saw they when they were um interviewing the woman to be the the uh the uh Supreme Court a woman who's going to be um deciding the the cases that's going to impact all of our lives in the in the nation and they asked her what is the definition of a woman yeah and here she is a woman calls herself one she said I can't even tell you that it's it's not a politically expedient same argument is going what's going in Jesus day when he's talking to Pilot pilate said what is truth so these philosophers have been doing this for years wow trying to obscure the lines and and blur the lines between right and wrong good and evil what's up is down now what's down is up and the Bible tells us that it would be that way in this day that they would call good evil and evil good if you stand for what's right you're considered a bigot and a hater is that right but every time that there's ever a battle so we want to go back to the battlefield the tactics of warfare so brother Branham he typed when they run into the promised land a lot of folks think well that's when we die and go to heaven but that's not what he typed it as when they entered into Canaan land that was receiving the Holy Ghost foreign they had to fight for every inch of ground that they had but now anytime that uh that a nation invades another nation and we see what's going on in Russia and Ukraine that every time that even though there's a a overwhelming Force that'll take it and I think about in in the days of uh when Germany attacked Poland and attacked France and attacked Russia and the different nations and took them over they had little groups in those every one of those areas and in Russia they had the partisans which was um they were like guerrilla warfare they would like blow up the Rail lines they would um they would try to do everything they could to uh to slow down the advance of the enemy that was called a pocket of resistance and any time that ever happens is always it's there to just worry and agitate it it doesn't really do a whole lot in the scheme of the war but it does help behind the lines if they need a bridge blown or or to interrupt the supply line and see that's the same as you and I when we receive the Holy Ghost he comes in an overwhelming for us but see there's still some things left in US little pockets of resistance is left little partisans in the in the French call it the French Resistance and they were well they were well trained well equipped and they had a purpose yeah and that purpose was to disrupt the enemy now the pockets of resistances in US is is demon powers it's the old man the Old Devil that's still in there and even when they took the the promised land they still had the jebusites and the Hittites and the parasites and the Canaanites amen yeah that they had to fight he's one of them although they were in The Promised Land and just because you received the Holy Ghost does not mean that you're immune from battles doesn't mean that you're immune from these these uh pockets of resistance in your life and in each one of these little strongholds is in your life is the enemy and he can stay there and he could send out little forces send out strike teams strike parties and disrupt everything in your life a lot of times me and he'll that little pocket of resistance called lust he'll send out a Strike Team and the next thing you know he said cut off your supply line brother Branham asked Paul Rader one time he preached like 2 000 messages in a row he said how do you do it he said as long as I don't get a kink in the hose it just flows right on down let me tell you something the devil's here to put a kick in your hose this morning in any way that he can out if it's with your job if it was with finances if it's with your family it was with somebody at church maybe maybe you thought they said a little something and it hurt your feelings see God the the devil's always there to try to put something between you and that supply line from God [Applause] we don't need to get that hose kinked up this morning young people if you're listening to me let me tell you something less supply line ain't in Facebook it ain't in tick talking it ain't in whatever the mother's media platforms are [Music] let me tell you something I just heard too and I didn't know this that that Tick-Tock thing comes from China and they they actually program an algorithm and the algorithm that their children have in China is how to be a better person how to achieve at school how to do this that another but the algorithmic program for the United States is absolute foolishness it's sexual it's dancing it's it's it's funnest jokes and practical jokes to corrupt the minds of the young people don't you think Satan they owned the war he's on his job this morning I had no idea that they could do that there's certain algorithms yeah let me tell you something the devil's got an algorithm he knows exactly he's using those programs I don't believe all that's the mark of the beast but I tell you what um the devil can certainly use it he can use anything we gotta stay focused on the Lord amen I like Facebook my face in this book amen foreign that's my Facebook I've got Facebook but let me tell you it's just it's just if I can't say nothing on it that's going to encourage you or that's going to edify or lift up the name of God I'm not going to put it on there amen you know a lot of folks say well we don't even need it at all let me tell you something it is it's here and it ain't going nowhere so I can wish it away or I can just learn how to what is that manage it yeah right see we have to deal with these things in life yeah yeah and let me tell you something just because you might cut off the internet to your kids they gonna find a way if they want to to find something older people too if you've got in your heart you can take a man out of the city and put him in the middle of the Rocky Mountain somewhere won't see another woman won't see a bottle of whiskey won't see a marijuana joint but it's still in his heart even though he's isolated away from it right it doesn't matter he still got it there and as soon as he gets around it boom picks it right back up again you see men in prison all the time they go to prisons they can't get it but it doesn't take away the desire see what we need this morning is a is a heart change [Applause] back in my back in my Wild and Woolly days as a Young Man I used to listen to a rock group and I hate to even call the name of them but they were good guns and roses and they had a a a album called Appetite for Destruction well I'm so glad this morning God changed my appetite amen I have an appetite for those things [Applause] it doesn't matter what if you take it away from if they've still got the appetite they're still going to Crave it gotta change the appetite help me Lord this morning oh my God but here's what you got to do here's what the enemy wants to do and this is a military cut off the beans bullets Band-Aids and then you get the bad guys beans is the food bullets is ammunition Band-Aids and medical supplies let me tell you something that's a tactic of warfare that's the three B Four B's beans bullets Band-Aids and bad guys y'all always remember that for the rest of your life you see we got to do that yeah we've got to cut the enemy off too you see this resistance Works in both ways we got to cut their supply line off is in your heart that's feeding that thing cut it off amen Jesus said if your eye feeds you plug it out now that's a metaphor we all know what a metaphor is but also it could be a medical terminology because if you get gangrene in your finger you better cut it off because it's going to poison your whole body if you get in the military a lot of times in the Army in the Civil War they get gangrene to arm or leg cut it off maybe that's what Jesus was referring to if it offends you if it's going to kill you you better get rid of the thing yeah if you stop by brother at a little convenience store and there's a there's a sweet-eyed young lady in there that bass her eyes at you every time you come in there and buy that Coke and pack of nabs that's what we call it packing naps cheese crackers and you start and you start kind of lacking that attention you start kind of liking that attention you better stay there you go you better take you another route yeah if you start getting on the Internet and you start seeing things that are that algorithm that's popping up better cut the thing off [Music] let me tell you something because what it's going to do is is it's going to cause you and I'm speaking from experience we've all dealt with this mess what it does is it causes you to start craving after that mess it's dopamine that's released in your brain it's a it's a physical thing that's actually going on yeah it's a it's an instant immediate reward to what you're looking at is it's a drug you can actually get addicted to these things and people do get addicted just all right this morning but let me tell you something the devil ain't playing paintball he ain't playing flag football he's playing for keeps he wants you he wants me he wants my children he would love nothing better than to see this church completely gone because we're we're standing in his way this bride in this world is standing the only thing holding him back it's the only thing holding that incarnate devil from standing on this Earth and being worshiped is God the Incarnate Satan will be standing in shoe leather is what we call it I mean incarnate devil will be but incarnate God will too that's you and I yeah you want to see Jesus this morning just look just look at your neighbor oh if we could just see Jesus in each other let me tell you something I want to see Jesus when I look in the mirror I don't see the old man oh my oh God I want to I want him to die I won't even be buried and rotten and never come up again that old man I don't want to just put on a a chain turn over a new Leaf this morning put on a new suit of clothes I won't exchange my life for his life [Applause] and the only way I know to do that is die to myself I was talking the other morning about prayer how that we we say prayer and we say things and it's like well it's a wish list well bless me and give me this and give me that oh oh Lord give me a Mercedes Benz all my friends have them I don't pray that but sometimes that's what prayer becomes well what prayer really is is a relationship it's a dying out of you and letting him come in more it's a conversation with the Lord talking to him oh God search my heart first off God I'm acknowledging you as Lord Of My Life I'm putting aside everything I'm shutting out all the voices I'm shutting out all the things in this world that takes my time away from you Lord I want to listen to you this morning what do you have to tell me [Music] can we find time in the morning to do that oh just for a little while I know we worked and we got things but just spend a little bit of moment just quietly alone like brother Jason was saying before you grab your phone before you turn on the the weather or anything else just pick up your Bible and say Lord what would you have me to read this morning what would you have me to say to read this morning and to take it to my old God I read your word now watch over that word in my heart hide it oh God let it grow Within Me Lord let me say something today that'll edify your kingdom God take away everything in me that's not like you let me hate what you hate and love what you love Lord dinner I know you're going to give me all the things that I need I'm not even asking for that but oh God as Jesus said give us this day our daily bread so Lord give me all that I have need of yeah but I love you just have a communion with him let me tell you something if you want to grow with God you read your Bible and you pray every day I'm not up here to here to see some great swelling thing that's the most simple thing that you can do and the devil will keep you from it every time he'll get you so busy and if you can't get you busy he'll get you depressed he'll get you mad about something he'll get you anxious about something he'll do everything that he can to keep you away from God's word my there's a blessing and Brokenness you know that [Music] how would you know how God feels about Sin how would Hosea have known if his wife hadn't went off so many times and he had to go get her he was hurt he wanted to divorce Israel because of what they did but he said look at what I look at what I'm putting up with Hosea I'm sorry you've got to go through this but this is what I'm dealing with every day and his wife would sell herself into into sexual sin and he would have to go buy her back every time and that's how sometimes we have to go through things to know how would we ever know what sin well how God failed until we hell we had to to uh deal with heartache we've got to go through pain and struggles in life that's the same thing that God feels every time you and I fail every time we sin he said it in his word amen but there's a blessing in that that we can grow now I want to talk in just a minute about letting them in the spirits in and I said this before but now and I want to say this as a before I get started if you have a cat this ain't nothing against you I'm not saying you can't have cats I like cats I like them outside but they're all right they're fluffy and furry my son he loves catself he loves every cat he sees so don't get me wrong this is just an allegory it's a big word ain't it yeah this is an allegory I have said metaphor a minute ago it said allegory so one time we moved into this house and we We inherited a cat no fault of our own just like we're born in this life and in sin no fault of our own that's just the card were dealt right so this cat's name was Snowball should have been Fury or demon or something else but it was snowballed and the people that had the house before us let the cat in all the time and and there's one thing I found out about a cat and if you laughing you'll know I'm telling the truth if you ever let him in one time you won't never get him to stay out again that's the truth you ever let him in and pet him and got him on your lap he thinks he's entitled then he's got a right to come in he'll climb you scream he'll cry out the door he'll get up in the windowsill he'll do all kinds of things and you're like hey you ain't coming in because snowball will come in and he had a bad habit of scratching up the furniture didn't know how to use a litter box and see there's a there's a thing about having cats in your house that maybe you may not know it because when you smell it long enough you don't smell it anymore but everybody else that comes over can smell it amen I can walk into somebody's house it's usually a lady and um and I know she's got cats I don't have to see a hairball I don't have to see a toy a litter but I just knows it because I can smell it and that's like you and I if you let something in your life you might hide in a little while but let me tell you something people that's you know not that close to you like some kind of wrong about Steve right now he ain't acting the way he used to act see you start you don't even realize it but there's something going on in your life you start kind of emitting little vibes especially if you're spiritual you can pick up on things like that one you know I just don't understand there's something going on but the ones that you got to really worry about and then them I could pray for Brother Steve and say well Lord there's something going on but it's the ones that's gotten them cats and these are the ones that they get me because I've never seen this before growing up but people can have cats and you don't even know they got them they're clean no smell at all they vacuum no hair or nothing else and that's just wonderful but let me tell you something what if that's a demon in your life that's like that and you can hide it so well that nobody else ever knows it see there's a spirit that you let in now you might get fed up with um Garfield and you want to toss him out well he's gonna try to get back in every time that's just like a spirit if you cast that you maybe you come to church you hear the preaching of the Gospel that thing's been bothering you boom it's gone but Jesus said that when the devil is cast out of a man it walks in dry places that's right now dryness and wetness the only thing I can figure is that water represents Humanity seas and Waters so it didn't have anybody else to go into so he's just walking around but then he said now I find my house is is well swept where I just came from and he goes back in and brings more with him now there's something else about a cat if you ever have one you ain't never got one you're gonna end up with two three four five I've seen it at so many times yeah it happens every time you feed one you're gonna have 15 before you and then they're gonna be calling you the crazy cat lady in the neighborhood I I've lived through it so I know what I'm talking about I ain't up here just telling you stories I'm telling you history unfortunately and so that old cat he would run soon as we would open the door and see that's what you do you sometimes you are you ain't coming in but you might crack that door just a little bit I'm not going to look at that little website but then it'll pop up and you crack that door just a little bit oh you talk about fast they'll come in between your legs and they're gone just like that right there yeah and now you got to deal with how you gonna get him so it'll run under the bed and we had carpet and how you gonna get that cat he's under that bed he's like looking at You Got Claws you know and it's just like if you want to get rid of him now you might call somebody to come in and get I need this demon gone well now you've you've called the preacher you've called another brother to come now that thing's going to be it's going to be fighting like crazy to get out from under that bed especially if you rap about the tail you ain't never seen a fight it's going to dig its claws into that carpet it ain't going nowhere see is that okay yeah y'all just think about your own life for a minute now you think about the things that you've let into your life cigarettes chewing tobacco alcohol you know movies all kind of it's music oh let's not even talk about music or let me rephrase that what they call music This Day foreign beats it's all here's a Beat let me tell you something the devil uses that stuff if you don't think he uses music to get the young people you're naive yeah yeah so now you try to get the cat out and you've called somebody to come help you and they help you get it out I try to get rid of this thing Brothers I need you to pray for me and to help you get it out but here's what happens a lot of times you walk outside maybe you're walking around the house and I don't even know what time I started brother I gotta I gotta try to finish this up and you're outside see now you've walked out a little bit you're like well I don't really feel like going to church tonight it's it's Wednesday it's raining so and so supposed to be preaching I sure don't go hear him [Applause] brother Tony ain't gonna be there at least singing y'all laughing because you know it's the truth but then what happens you go outside and and that cat's out there oh he's so sweet he comes up to you rubbing your leg got that little tail up in there turns that motor on he's rubbing up against your leg first thing you do y'all little sweet little kid he started rubbing him Petty pick him up oh I'll just take you in for a little while right back at it again there you go again how many's ever done that before in the spiritual life I'm done with that thing and then there it is again bring it right back in again but you know what an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure ain't it yeah you know the best way to keep a cat out of your house get you a dog [Applause] brother Branham top the dog is the Holy Spirit remember that Old Prospector he had that whole he had that dog and he kept warning him waking him up in the middle of the night finally he got rid of it didn't he but why don't we get the holy spirit in our hearts amen and every time that cat tries he'll chase him right out of the house again amen he'll watch over you I pray God watch over your word in my heart keep me from evil Lord lead me not into temptation oh God deliver me from evil um that's where I want to be yeah so now we've got to arm ourselves properly and we got to take up have our loins go to about with truth wherefore taking your whole armor of God back in Ephesians 6 stand therefore having your loins good about with truth put having the breastplate of righteousness oh God sanctify me righteousness means right living if I live a holy life son the wrong and do the right I know the Lord will make a way for me we got to live right we can't just put on can't just come to church and then well I've done all I need to do and then the rest of the week you live like any old thing you want to well they say there's plenty of churches out there that let you do that well you can do it here but you ain't gonna grow and on top of that you're going to hinder the rest of us because let me tell you something I have purpose in my heart to not be here when that when the Lord comes I I want to go with him when that fire falls I want to go [Applause] y'all got quiet not be here at church I mean be here when my mind was thinking faster than my mouth could go that's a that's a common problem with me I stuttered oh my each shoe leather a lot of times anybody ever stuck your foot in your mouth speaking of that have your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace I want it shod with the preparation I want peace to come out of my mouth not fighting not not fussing and carrying on and worrying about Democrat and Republican who cares let me tell you something they so worried about the red and the blue States it's like the crew members of the Titanic rearranging the deck chairs well they need to go over here no they need to go over what there is all going down [Applause] man hey man above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith Yar you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked now I read that back then you know we see in the in the pictures they had Shields of of iron but a lot of times it's wooden Shields and they would coat them with leather and they would soak them in water and that was to when they shot those fiery arrows at them it would quench those arrows you ever heard that amen take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God now I want to tell you something else I've I've was reading about David y'all might have heard of him David and Goliath and so but you know we all face Giants in our life don't we that was a classic that was a Warfare battle they started trash talking each other I'll feed your your the buzzer's gonna eat you and this that I'll you know whatever and so it was just a good old-fashioned you know Throwdown and so what did what did David do he picked out that stone any any Lodge and let me tell you something a little hundred pound 110 pound guy sling I don't care how fast he could have slung that rock would not have killed Goliath it would have he would have bounced off of him you're talking about a 10 foot 11 foot 12 foot guy yeah that's not gonna do anything but let me tell you something that happens and that's in your life also when you come up against something that you just can't get over you come against a mountain or a giant in your life that that you just can't get past it you can't defeat it when that thing comes in your life and try this the next time but when that thing comes up and that Temptation comes you just say oh God just like David picked up that stone and a stone is a sign of judgment it's also a symbol of Memorial so God I I'm not strong enough to fight this battle okay first off David said the battle is not mine but Lord I give it to you God it's your battle but when that thing comes up in your life you put that stone of faith of judgment and of a memorial of what God has done for you you think about that stone that they laid in front of the Tomb that they sealed they thought they had him Satan thought he had him let me tell you something on Sunday morning the angel rolled that stone away Lord I take that stone Satan thought he had you but you're the Risen Savior this morning I don't have any strength in my life I don't have any strength of my own because the weapon is not of warfare is not carnal amen so God I can't fight it just on my own I can't read self-help books I can't read this book or that book God I need you to fight this battle for me amen let me tell you something when David took up that that rock and he gave the battle to God when that stone left that sling I could imagine that it sounded like a 30-06 breaking the sound barrier when it went there and it hit that giant and knocked him right on his back and he cut his head off and that's the same thing that'll happen to you because you don't have any strength of your own but our Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it then they're safe amen mm-hmm now Ephesians 5 15 tells us that we were to walk circumspectly how many of you knows what circumspectly means I had to look it up I've always you know nobody knows what circumspectly means that's a military terminology they'll tell you when you're walking on patrol Keep Your Head on a swivel that's what it means Look up the word circuit means taking account of everything that is around you above you down below you being ready at any time for the devil to come so you walk with your head on a swivel you're looking this way you're looking that way amen we don't need to get caught off guard oh my I think I've already covered that pretty good now actually let's go ahead and go to Acts 2 36. we usually read 238 but I just want to stop at 236 for just a moment is this okay this morning about five ten more minutes Acts 2 36 and this is after Peter the day of Pentecost and he's preaching to these people I mean he's letting it go and this is what he says he says therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ now here's the one I want you to get now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart sit down to Peter into the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do now hold that place and turn to Ezekiel 11 19. can you do that real fast I'll turn with you I hear some pages turning if the brother can get it up there Ezekiel he could probably do it faster than I can Ezekiel 11 19 some of you may already know where I'm going and I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you and I will take the Stony heart out of their flesh and will give them and heart of Flesh so they had a Stony heart all right all of us have Stony hearts until God comes in and perform surgery on us [Applause] now here's the thing that I want you to see hold that all right you know go back to acts now I want you to go over to acts 7. it's just two pages over if you have a Scofield act seven and what is that 50 54. and and Stephen is preaching a holy ghost sermon right here he was preaching and just kind of he was kind of extolling them and telling them about the things about Egypt and and and and and Moses and Abraham but then something happens and the Holy Ghost takes over it I've read this scripture so many times you know exactly when the Holy Ghost takes over and Stephen stops talking that's right here in for in 48 I'm sorry 51. yeast stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do you which of the which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the just one of whom you have now I have been now the betrayers and murderers who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept when they heard these things they were cut to their heart and they gnashed on them with their teeth see there was a difference when Peter preached to that 3000 because they they were genuine believers they said what must we do to be saved it was a different circumstance for these Pharisees they didn't all they were just trying to find a way to accuse Stephen and to kill him see they still had those Stony hearts but the other ones were open they had their hearts they had a heart of Flesh God had already started dealing with them see he starts on both ends he starts working over here then he had Peter stand up full of the Holy Ghost preaching and the Bible says now I'm going to use a allegory he took that sword of the spirit and what is that the word and he's and he stuck it right to their hearts now what that did when they were print to their heart they cut away all the all the old uh ideas and all the old denominationalism it cut away all the fleshism and all the traditions and it went straight to the heart and it bricked it and they were oh God we receive it and three thousand men were added to the church in one day but there's something different that happened when Stephen was preaching it because the Bible says they were cut to their heart and after it cut through the traditions and cut through everything and it cut through all their ideas and their man-made Creeds there was nothing else there but a Stony heart and that was revealed to them they knew he was telling the truth it reminds me of that young girl that that rejected everything that brother Brown tried to get her to do he tried to get her to stop going to the dances try to get her to quit running around these boys and she said oh she went down to another church and he said it was okay let me tell you something anything you want to do in life you can find somebody they'll tell you it's okay to do it she kept going down to that little old church and before you know it she got a venereal disease for running around and sleeping around and ended up dying in the hospital and what happens when the devil's got you and he knows he's got you she was dying and that demon said I've done my job I don't have to stick around so that all that anointing that she had and it just pulled off of her and then she knew her eyes were open and she's told that preacher she said you deceiver you deceived me because there was nothing in her heart everything had been cut away it'd been Stripped Away and there was nothing left now but judgment for her and she realized it and these men did the same thing when Stephen preached they realized they had nothing all that was there when the word came and cut away all the Traditions there was nothing there but Blackness and a Stony heart God this morning don't let me be that way oh God let me have if I've got if I've got anger if I've got a little unforgiveness in my heart and somebody if I've got anything Lord take it out of me oh God give me a heart of Flesh this morning one that you can mold one that you can prick me this morning Lord with your word oh God thank you Lord any good to us now I want to talk to you just a minute just a few more minutes I was talking about how Germany invaded in Russia and they had a diabolical plan when they uh surrounded the town of Leningrad which is now Saint Petersburg millions of people were in the city and they didn't want to expand the ammunition and the and the supplies it would take to go in and take the city and the Manpower so they were just going to just build a little hedge about around it and wall the entire city in it's called laying Siege to a city and they laid Siege to the city of Leningrad and and they starved them and they wouldn't let any supplies in and I wondered this morning if the devil's laid Siege into your life but sometimes those little things in our heart those little pockets of resistance can break out and might even take control of your life the next thing you know you don't even feel like going to church you don't feel like reading the Bible you don't feel like fellowshipping when your brothers and sisters now you're seized off Satan's got you hemmed around he's got you cut off oh my so Germany did this to the Russian people and they were dying they had wonderful beautiful works of art they were selling for just a handful of flour to eat they were chopping up their their beautiful pianos and things and and just use it for firewood just to stay alive and when it seemed like it was the worst time ever they were right to the back of the city was the Baltic Sea and it was got so cold that winter it was one of the coldest winters and that was that winner is what actually defeated Germany because the ground froze and then the Russian Vehicles could come across but also something that happened was the very thing that that held them and kept them from escaping the very thing that had been bound was the Baltic seed but something happened in the middle of winter it froze over yeah and they started bringing in trucks of Wheat and trucks of of bread and food and and they it was a lifeline and to the people of Leningrad and it saved the city it saved the people until they could come in and switch the enemy away and this morning maybe you've got to the lowest point that you can get to I think about the Hebrew children when they went into the fire and I know they're having a play about this up at the camp but I just always think about this this scenario when they walk into the fire and it's like the darkest time of their life have you prayed up yes I've prayed up are you going to buy we're not going to Bow God's able to deliver us but even if he don't we're not going to bow and when they got into the middle of the fire old brothers and sisters remember this the only thing that burned on them the only thing that burned not even a smell of smoke on them the only thing that burned on him was the roof that had him bound maybe God's taking you through the fire this morning maybe he's taking you through a trial or a battle to loosen the very thing that's had you bound you don't even realize why oh God I pray this morning that's the case that he'll loosen those things on you he might take that fiery trial to let you realize where you're at with him maybe you need a closer walk maybe you need to pray more maybe you need to be more sincere maybe it's the thing that's held you Bound for so long God's able to deliver you this morning you believe it oh my um you're loving this morning I got one more story I want to tell and this this always as far as fighting a battle sometimes it didn't always a fight you know the best way to fight a battle with the Lord it's surrender the international sign of Victory is what is it the international sound surrender is what is both the same I Surrender now I have victory I surrender all the Lord now I have victory but there was a picture I saw one time many of you might have seen it and uh it's always stuck with me and I've never forgot I read the fox's book of Martyrs and and those stories just rip your heart out and I was looking at this painting and it was if you can in your mind's eye just imagine this it was a uh Scene It was the Roman Roman Coliseum and they had you can see the sky this it was kind of the sun was going down it was almost dark because right at dusk but the beautiful painting the kind of like those clouds there you can see but it was getting dark and inside the the Coliseum was really dark except for lights like the Torches rolling around and then you start looking at the Torches and you realize those are people and they were hung on the cross and they say that they should take the women the the Christian sisters because they wouldn't Bob their hair off and things like that and they would take them they would dip their dip their heads down in the pitch and tar and they would light them on fire and that's what they used to light the Coliseum with and in the middle of the Coliseum was a group of Christians sitting there and they were they were all in their hands and knees probably maybe 20 or 30. and there was one old man standing up with his hands lifted up to heaven they all were praying he had his hands up to God and you can look over here on this side of the painting and there was lions they were getting ready and they just opened the gate and the lines were coming out and I've often looked at that picture and it's it's just it impacted me so much because I think about oh God you know where were you and all that where were you but I know that God took those people that sacrifice and they gave everything that they had they would not bow they would not relent they would not recant to the church or the paganism at the time but they stood fast and stood strong and even though their blood was spilled on that ground it made it sacred that grounded this day to me is still sacred it's Hallowed Ground where those Martyrs died oh my and I think about my own life and I think about my trials and my old card am I any better than them when I I'm in the midst of a trial or battle and I'm like oh God am I I mean am I any better than what they went through God forgive me help me Lord help me to be stronger help me to trust in you help me to not give up not let up but let me stay up pray up and then God you take me up I want to go up amen where the musicians come up here brother Tony whoever's coming do you love him this morning I just sometimes I feel so ashamed of myself I feel like oh what was me I guess I'm the only one in here woe is me but I know one thing he's faithful and he's true and he'll deliver you yeah maybe it's God's will that whatever trial you're going through is to be a blessing to somebody else but he'll make this trial a blessing and let me tell you something too let me tell you something too there's a song even the valley is higher ground and that's so true when you go up in the mountains we go we used to live in Virginia you go up Fancy Gap mountain and you're at 3 000 feet that's the valley for the rest of the mountains the rest of them are six and seven thousand feet up in there but once you're in the valley you're still 3 000 feet above down here and that's the life of a that's the Christian Life you may not always be on the Mountaintop there's an old song that says nothing grows high on top of the mountain you can't stay up there all the time and the mountaintops are really small areas you know it's not up there where you grow you go up there to worship and the praise and the the blessings of God are just moving in your life and you're just like man I'm on top of the world and the next thing you know wow the road just got pulled out from under your feet that's happened to me time and time and time again but you know what it's down in that Valley through the trials and temptations that's where your soul is restored oh we can't understand well Lord I'm in a valley well I led you here Psalms 23 he leadeth me beside the Still Waters the Lord leads you down that way sometimes well you can't always stay up there on the high amount and you ain't really going nowhere you're just there you can't really feed your sheep up there can you they got to come back down with the pastures of Green Meadows sometimes you don't want to be there but that's where you need to be and I thank the Lord for the the mountaintops I thank you for the valleys I thank you for the cliffs I feel like I've been on sometimes Lord I Thank you y'all for all of it do you love him why aren't we staying this morning [Music] good right there [Music] what do you got bro the name of the Lord amen a strong tower the

not right just think about it for just a moment say Lord is there anything in my life that would hinder you speaking to me and and hinder the you speaking to others at that camp and I just want us to
