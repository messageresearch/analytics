[15:23] Oh my hope
[15:25] [Music]

[15:52] Are you thankful for that? To offer
[15:56] healing and forgiveness.
[16:00] Yes, Lord.
[16:02] And those who trust in him will find
[16:07] their hearts at rest.
[16:11] My hope

[17:11] Oh,
[17:14] amen. Want to sing that song? Well, keep
[17:16] it in G. Is that okay? So, forget about
[17:19] yourself. I love this song. Lord just
[17:23] brought this song to me yesterday and I
[17:25] sang it all day yesterday. Sang it all
[17:27] day to today, this afternoon. It's an
[17:30] oldie, but it's a goldie. And I just
[17:33] think that the words mean so much. We
[17:36] have come into his house to magnify his
[17:40] name and to worship him. Is that the
[17:42] reason why you came tonight?
[17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[17:53] part of it we're going to sing that
[17:55] says, so forget about yourself.
[17:59] Man, you know, sometimes that's what we
[18:00] need to do. I think the biggest thing
[18:03] that gets in the way of worshiping the
[18:04] Lord sometimes is our self. We think
[18:06] about oursel. Well, it ain't about us.
[18:09] Amen. Forget about yourself. Concentrate
[18:12] on him. Amen. And then you can worship
[18:15] him.

[31:20] his healing
[31:22] of his cleansing power,
[31:25] revealing
[31:27] how he made the lame to walk again. And
[31:32] he calls the blind to see.
[31:37] Oh, and then I cried,
[31:40] "Dear Jesus,

[34:06] of praise for that. Hallelujah. Think
[34:09] about it, friends. He loved me before he
[34:12] knew me.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; He already loved me. Amen. Aren't you
[34:16] God for that? But the Bible says his
[34:18] love was shown to us in this way that
[34:21] while we were yet sinners, Christ died
[34:24] for us. Say, when did he die for me? For
[34:26] my sins? When I was at an altar? When I
[34:28] was, you know, repented and cleaned up?
[34:31] No. He looked at you at your worst
[34:33] moment and said that there you are worth
[34:36] it to die for in this condition. How

[36:54] Every step that I take,
[36:58] every move that I make,
[37:02] every tear that I cry. Oh, he knows my
[37:07] name when I'm overwhelmed by the pain.

[37:26] I don't know what tomorrow will bring.
[37:31] I can't tell you what's in store. I
[37:35] don't know a lot of things.
[37:39] Is that how you feel? I don't have all
[37:42] the answers to the questions of life.
[37:48] Oh, but I know in whom I have
[37:53] and he knows my name. Oh, every step
[37:57] that I take and every move that I make,
[38:04] every tear that I cry. Oh, and he knows
[38:09] my name. When I'm overwhelmed by the
[38:13] pain,
[38:15] I can't see the light of day.
[38:19] I know I'll be just fine cuz he knows my
[38:24] name.
[38:25] [Music]
[38:28] [Applause]
[38:30] And
[38:31] Amen. Let him know he's welcome. Praise
[38:34] the Lord. Or you want to make sure he's
[38:36] in your midst. Amen. That's what makes
[38:38] it count. You can gather anywhere,
[38:40] anytime, but if you got him in in your
[38:43] midst, it almost doesn't matter where
[38:45] you gather as long as he's there. Amen.
[38:48] God bless you this evening. I'm going to
[38:50] invite you right into the scripture to 2
[38:52] Corinthians chapter 4. May I greet you
[38:54] in the name of the Lord. Happy to have
[38:55] you in the house of God on a midweek
[38:58] service. Praise the Lord, Sister Don.
[39:00] Good to see you and your family here.
[39:01] God bless you. Amen.
[39:04] Want to by the help of the Lord continue
[39:06] on from last Wednesday. We were we took
[39:09] part one of sin comes from sinful ways.
[39:13] And I um I was able by the help of the
[39:16] Lord to get through um the the real
[39:19] initial burden of my heart on that. And
[39:22] we had a wonderful time and the Lord had
[39:25] a lot of feedback from that sermon. And
[39:27] when the amount that I got back let me
[39:30] know that it that we really are all in
[39:32] this thing together. Amen. We really
[39:35] are. Everybody had an affinity uh with
[39:38] that. And I know and I I had several
[39:40] people uh even before I could get gone
[39:42] from the church say, "Brother Jason, you
[39:44] were preaching to me." And I said to one
[39:46] brother, I just put my hand on his
[39:47] shoulder. I said, "Brother, that was
[39:48] preaching to me." Amen. Amen. Praise the
[39:51] Lord. So, I want to continue tonight and
[39:54] I want to catch some of the um maybe I
[39:57] would call it the practical side of that
[39:59] thought that we didn't have time to get
[40:01] to last Wednesday. But I think these
[40:03] things are good. The Bible is for our
[40:06] instruction, for our admonition. Amen.
[40:08] Uh the the lives of the people are
[40:10] examples that we learn from. And so I
[40:14] want to look at that part of it tonight.
[40:17] 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and we're going
[40:20] to read verses 1-6. If you have it, say
[40:23] amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. 2
[40:25] Corinthians 4 1-6.
[40:31] Therefore, seeing we have this ministry,
[40:35] as we have received mercy, we faint not,
[40:39] but have renounced the hidden things of
[40:41] dishonesty,
[40:43] not walking in craftiness, nor handling
[40:46] the word of God deceitfully, but by
[40:48] manifestation of the truth, commending
[40:51] ourselves to every man's conscience in
[40:55] the sight of God. But if our gospel be
[40:58] hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in
[41:01] whom the God of this world hath blinded
[41:04] the minds of them which believe not,
[41:07] lest the light of the glorious gospel of
[41:10] Christ, who is the image of God, should
[41:13] shine unto them. For we preach not
[41:16] ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord,
[41:19] and ourselves your servants for Jesus'
[41:22] sake. For God who commanded the light to
[41:25] shine out of darkness, hath shined in
[41:28] our hearts, you happy for that?
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Has shined in our hearts to give the
[41:34] light of the knowledge of the glory of
[41:37] God in the face of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[41:40] Let's pray.
[41:42] Father, we stand before this redeemed
[41:46] audience tonight, Lord, and there's many
[41:49] things that could be said. You're the
[41:51] word of God is just a unlimited Lord in
[41:55] its in its breadth and its height and
[41:57] its depth and Lord it's a it's a like a
[42:01] sea with no bottom. It just comes Lord
[42:04] and it just keeps coming and we are
[42:07] thankful for that. Now in all of that uh
[42:11] sea of word that could be said tonight
[42:14] we believe Lord that we have exactly
[42:16] your mind for the service tonight. a
[42:19] portion of your word, Lord, that we
[42:21] might learn better of thee. I pray
[42:24] tonight for myself in body that you
[42:26] would touch me and strengthen me. Bless
[42:28] the audience, Lord, speaker and hearer,
[42:31] that let nothing hinder your word going
[42:33] forth. We pray and commit it to you,
[42:35] Lord. I have such a confidence in you
[42:38] and your word, and I know that it will
[42:40] accomplish everything that it's intended
[42:42] to accomplish. Ours, Lord, is to relax.
[42:45] Let the Holy Spirit be the speaker. And
[42:48] I do just that right now Lord in Jesus
[42:50] name. Amen. God bless you friends. You
[42:52] can be seated.
[42:59] It's very interesting when you read the
[43:03] passages there from Paul's letter to the
[43:07] Corinthian church his second letter and
[43:10] he makes a comment in that fourth verse.
[43:14] in whom the God of this world hath
[43:16] blinded the minds of them which believe
[43:19] not lest the light of the glorious
[43:22] gospel of Christ who is the image of God
[43:25] should shine unto them. So we know that
[43:28] Christ is his word and his word Christ
[43:31] shines to the people through his word.
[43:33] Jesus isn't here corporally walking the
[43:36] shores of Galilee uh presenting himself
[43:39] to people. He's here in the form of his
[43:41] word. He's here in the form of his holy
[43:43] ghost. He's here in the form of his
[43:45] bride family. Amen. And and ours it is
[43:49] uh to to be a reflector of his life. And
[43:54] the Holy Ghost who is the enforcer of
[43:56] the word is here to bring God's word to
[44:00] pass in everyone who will believe it. So
[44:03] who all believes it tonight?
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, you're you're fortunate
[44:07] because
[44:09] there's a there's there's another power
[44:12] loose in the world who's actually a god
[44:14] with a small G. And verse four makes it
[44:18] clear that there's a God beside the God.
[44:22] Besides him, there's another one who has
[44:26] been by popular demand of the
[44:29] populations of the earth has been
[44:31] elected to be the leader to be the god
[44:35] as Paul said the god of this world. And
[44:38] so when brother Brandham would come
[44:39] along, he would take that as a theme and
[44:42] he would preach a message the god of
[44:45] this evil age. And you know we we were
[44:49] looking at last time and just to recap a
[44:52] small portion of that I noticed on the
[44:54] archive that it missed the first about
[44:56] the first 10 12 15 maybe 10 to 12
[44:59] minutes of the sermon. So I was and all
[45:02] I had done in those 10 minutes was to
[45:05] talk uh to establish the um the flow
[45:09] between natural warfare and spiritual
[45:13] warfare. Now, we know that we're
[45:14] fighting the greatest battle ever
[45:16] fought, but we know that's a spiritual
[45:18] warfare. We know that the battle we
[45:21] fight is not against flesh and blood,
[45:23] but it's against principalities. It's
[45:25] against powers. They're real powers of
[45:28] the air. There there are evil forces
[45:31] that Paul is referring to here. And we
[45:34] dealt with it last time how that under
[45:36] the fifth trumpet, the lid was torn from
[45:38] hell, a star fell from heaven. Exactly.
[45:41] uh Isaiah's prophecy concerning Lucifer.
[45:44] How art thou fallen from heaven, oh
[45:46] Lucifer, son of the morning. And he had
[45:48] a key to the bottomless pit. He opens
[45:51] the pit and that that in history and
[45:53] prophecy correlating prophecy to
[45:55] history, we know that was right around
[45:57] the time of the turn of the 20th
[45:59] century. And you can see it because
[46:01] since that time, before that time, we
[46:05] had had wars and rumors of wars, but we
[46:07] had never had world war. And from that
[46:10] time in the early part of the 20th
[46:12] century, you can see that the world
[46:15] digressed into uh a worsening situation
[46:19] of chaos, sin, anger, warfare, political
[46:24] drama, stress, uh nation against nation.
[46:28] Signs of the time, signs that Jesus said
[46:31] the last age would see. Now, you say,
[46:33] "Well, the last age, we've had a bunch
[46:36] of generations since the turn of the
[46:38] 20th century." But don't forget
[46:40] something, friends, that with with God,
[46:43] uh, it takes a thousand of your of our
[46:47] earth years to equal one day in his
[46:49] time. And that doesn't mean, don't ma
[46:52] misunderstand, that doesn't mean that
[46:55] one of his days is like being here for a
[46:58] thousand years. to him from his
[47:00] perspective it's a day
[47:03] &gt;&gt; much like you have a day but you know
[47:05] and they they have proven that Einstein
[47:07] proved that in his special theory of
[47:08] relativity and later on his general
[47:10] theor theory of relativity I mean if you
[47:13] this is this scientific fact which if
[47:16] you were able theoretically it's
[47:18] impossible to do we don't have the
[47:19] technology for it but if you were able
[47:21] to stand nanometers away from an event
[47:25] horizon of Sagittarius A
[47:28] one minute of that time. And that's at
[47:30] the center of the Milky Way. It's a
[47:32] black hole center of the Milky Way. It's
[47:34] 10,000 times the the size of our own
[47:36] sun. And and and if you were able to
[47:38] stand there in front of Sagittarius at
[47:40] the event horizon for one minute, if you
[47:43] could hover over it for one minute,
[47:46] 700 Earth years would pass
[47:49] &gt;&gt; while you were there for one minute. And
[47:51] to you, it would just seem like one
[47:52] minute. And back here, it would be 700
[47:54] years. So you can see why brother
[47:57] Brandham when he would correlate that
[47:59] that that the Bible says in the last
[48:02] days and brother Brandham would
[48:03] interject and say the last 2,000 years.
[48:07] The last two days, the last 2,000 years.
[48:11] So time doesn't mean the same thing to
[48:13] God that it means to us. We're dropped
[48:16] down into a negative time, a little loop
[48:18] down from eternity. You know, we've got
[48:20] a scripture here shortly where Luke is
[48:24] describing. Matthew doesn't catch this.
[48:27] Matthew, uh, when you go to Mark or you
[48:29] go to John, they don't really, John
[48:31] doesn't deal with the the temptation of
[48:33] the wilderness. Then, um, Mark deals
[48:36] with it a little bit more. Uh, but he
[48:38] doesn't talk about the time where Satan
[48:40] showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the
[48:42] world. You get that from Luke. You get
[48:44] that from Matthew. But Luke gives the
[48:46] most detail. And Luke says actually that
[48:49] Satan showed him all the kingdoms of the
[48:53] earth from start to finish. The ones
[48:57] that had been, that were, and that would
[48:59] and that would come. And the Bible says
[49:02] he showed them to the Lord in a moment
[49:04] of time.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; So, so when you're dealing with those
[49:09] eternal realms, it doesn't mean exactly
[49:11] the same thing. Our perspective, uh, you
[49:13] just realize here you're living in a
[49:15] shadow. And the reason that that's
[49:17] important, friends, is because when you
[49:20] can realize that, then you know that
[49:22] God's got all of this. He's already got
[49:24] it. You're already fixed. It's it's
[49:26] already signed, sealed, and secured. And
[49:29] you're you're God is not going to lose
[49:31] you. A God that can dwell in that kind
[49:33] of a realm isn't worried about you get
[49:36] worried about what you go through last
[49:38] week, this week, or maybe next week.
[49:40] He's not worried at all. He already sees
[49:41] the whole thing. He's already got the
[49:43] whole thing fixed out.
[49:46] So we go through it. Why then? Why do we
[49:48] go through it? For our training. I don't
[49:51] know why you'll go through certain
[49:53] things that I might not have to go
[49:54] through. I don't know why I have to go
[49:57] through certain things you might not
[49:58] have to go through. But on the other
[50:00] side, you don't know yet what you'll be
[50:02] doing. Whatever is going to be your your
[50:06] position there. And if you go into the
[50:09] Old Testament, you can see that
[50:10] everybody's got a position. It's not
[50:12] just sitting around on a cloud playing a
[50:14] harp. We're going to we're going to
[50:16] live. We're going to life. We're going
[50:18] to a civilization that'll never end.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; And if you look in the Old Testament,
[50:23] everybody had a job when they were
[50:25] building the temple. You you you
[50:27] everybody had a position in Nehemiah's
[50:29] day. Everybody had a position. So, I'm
[50:31] glad to know that I'm not just, you
[50:34] know, going through life figuring it out
[50:36] and God is just saying, "Okay, you're
[50:38] saved. See you in heaven." It's not
[50:40] that. He's very much involved in my life
[50:43] in heavily involved in your life and you
[50:45] can take confidence in that.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; We were showing you last time
[50:54] how that this spiritual warfare that we
[50:57] face
[50:58] and we we were we were talking about the
[51:01] theme of sin coming from sinful ways. I
[51:05] want to really take a practical look at
[51:07] that tonight. Uh because the laws of
[51:11] nature dictate that if you put apple
[51:14] seed and sew apple seed, you'll grow an
[51:17] apple tree. And if you sew a weed seed,
[51:22] you'll grow a weed. Whatever you sow,
[51:26] that's what you will reap. That's a law
[51:29] of the physical universe. That's the
[51:32] laws of nature that have been going on.
[51:35] What whatsoever you sow, that's what you
[51:38] reap. Now, the the the rub of that is
[51:41] the both the glory and the rub is that
[51:44] if you sow the wrong seed, that whatever
[51:47] seed you sow when you reap it, you reap
[51:49] a whole lot more than you sowed.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; You take just a couple of seed to and
[51:56] but you get a whole ear of corn.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. a whole a whole uh head of wheat
[52:01] with many seed. So if you have sowed
[52:04] poorly then that's why the Bible says
[52:07] when you sow to the wind you'll reap the
[52:09] whirlwind. You don't just get the wind
[52:11] back you get it becomes a whirlwind. Now
[52:13] the flip side of that is is when you sew
[52:15] to the kingdom of God it multiplies
[52:17] itself back to you. When you sew
[52:20] according to the word, then you can be
[52:24] just as assured as a farmer is, whatever
[52:26] seed he puts in the ground, it's going
[52:28] to come up and it's going to have a
[52:29] manifold manifestation. And so, I want
[52:32] to spend every every moment I can sewing
[52:34] the word of God. Sewing the word of God.
[52:37] Sewing the word of God. And if you have
[52:40] spent parts of your life uh sewing uh
[52:44] Hey, hate to turn you around, bud. I
[52:46] need some water. Yeah. Amen. You're not
[52:48] a rookie, but you're out of practice.
[52:50] Amen.
[52:53] Amen. Praise the Lord. I had one on my
[52:56] desk if you was going to bring me that
[52:57] one. Amen. Praise the Lord, brother
[52:59] Matt. Amen. So, so we find then that
[53:04] that in this law of nature that
[53:07] sometimes we we go down our lives and we
[53:11] we find that we have sown seed that we
[53:14] wish we hadn't have sown. And a lot of
[53:17] times we find ourselves praying for a
[53:19] crop failure.
[53:22] Well, listen. You remember when when
[53:27] Esther came before a hazarus and it was
[53:29] through a deceitful tactic that that
[53:32] evil wicked Hmon co ha caused the king
[53:37] to decree a hazarus decreed a law that
[53:40] was the like the law of the me and
[53:42] Persians and couldn't be retracted. And
[53:44] the law was that on a certain day all
[53:48] the Jews could be killed. Every the
[53:50] whole nation could rise up and kill all
[53:51] the Jews. The problem was Esther was a
[53:55] Jew. No one knew that. The king didn't
[53:58] even know that. She finally outed her
[54:00] own self. I also will perish with my
[54:03] people. And so, so we realize that that
[54:07] she the king says, "Well, what do you
[54:08] want me to do?" And she says, "Change
[54:10] the law." He says, "Esther, I can't do
[54:11] that. That's the laws of the Mes and
[54:13] Persians. Even I can't take back my own.
[54:16] You under you see the the type the
[54:18] spiritual type. God said whatsoever you
[54:21] sow, that's what you reap. That was his
[54:23] law. And you say, "But Lord, I sowed bad
[54:25] seed and the devil made me do it and all
[54:27] this kind of stuff." And Paul
[54:28] acknowledges that that the law which was
[54:30] for my good became for my death because
[54:33] Satan took advantage of it. And so this
[54:36] is what Hmon did. He took advantage of
[54:38] the situation and caused a death
[54:40] sentence to now be on Esther. And so God
[54:43] is saying, you know, you God is saying,
[54:45] son, child, daughter, son, I can't take
[54:49] back my word. If you, if this seed has
[54:52] been sown, it will have to come forth.
[54:55] And so there now, what are you going to
[54:57] do? And Esther's going to die. But what
[55:00] a Hazarus said, but here's what I can
[55:02] do. I can make another law. And I'll
[55:05] make a law that since all the Jews, and
[55:08] I don't remember the dates, I don't
[55:10] remember. I think it may be the 29th,
[55:12] whatever PM is. And he said, "So on the
[55:15] let's just call it the 29th of that
[55:17] month when you can be killed. I'll make
[55:19] a law that on the 28th of that month,
[55:22] all the Jews can arm themselves and kill
[55:24] all their enemies."
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; So now on the 29th when the sun rose up,
[55:29] that law was still in effect. But the
[55:31] the other law over the top of that law
[55:34] had destroyed the effect of that law.
[55:37] Remember Jesus said by your traditions
[55:40] you've made the word of God of no effect
[55:41] to the people. And so so now you say
[55:45] Lord I I did I I I swed bad seed. I have
[55:48] such regret. What can I do about it?
[55:50] Just start sewing good seed over the top
[55:52] of it.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Just start say Lord help me. Get in get
[55:54] in my life. Live through my life. Let me
[55:56] sew good seed over the top of it. And
[55:58] when it comes up I'll never even know
[56:00] it. No one will even know it. It won't
[56:02] have any effect on me. Amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; And the only one it will affect because
[56:06] you repented of it is brother Brandham
[56:08] said it goes back on the head of the
[56:09] devil and he has to stand trial for it
[56:12] while you're seated on the throne with
[56:14] Christ.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. So, so yes, we are
[56:20] fighting a terrible spiritual battle,
[56:22] but we have a fantastic general and he
[56:26] has equipped us and he has supplied us
[56:29] in this battle in this spiritual warfare
[56:32] that we fight.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; I asked you last time a very sensible
[56:37] question. Would you go to war? Just
[56:40] think now, natural war. Would you go to
[56:42] war against a highly advanced, highly
[56:45] conditioned, and highly trained army
[56:47] that was at with supplied with the most
[56:50] advanced weaponry? They were highly
[56:52] trained. They were highly advanced. They
[56:55] were highly conditioned. Would you go up
[56:57] against them with no training, no
[57:00] conditioning, and no weapons? And the
[57:02] obvious answer is of course not. Because
[57:04] if you did, uh, you would you if you
[57:07] didn't die, if you weren't annihilated
[57:09] in the first few minutes of the battle,
[57:12] you would very quickly be taken a
[57:13] prisoner of war. You would have
[57:15] basically less than no chance against an
[57:18] army like that if you went out
[57:20] unprepared. And so we found that many of
[57:24] God's people, uh, God's children, that
[57:28] God never intended for them to become
[57:30] PS.
[57:32] God never intended for you to get bound
[57:34] by your flesh. God never intended for
[57:37] you to be a weak Christian. God never
[57:39] intended for you to have a besetting sin
[57:41] that you couldn't beat. But some people
[57:43] get those and they're children of God.
[57:46] And I and that was the real big point I
[57:48] was trying to make last time. I'm, you
[57:50] know, I know brother Brandham talks
[57:51] about, you know, people who live in
[57:54] various varying degrees of
[57:56] sanctification like the foolish virgin,
[57:58] the unwise virgin. They don't actually
[57:59] have the oil. They're not actually born
[58:01] again, but they have had an experience
[58:03] with the Holy Ghost. They they have
[58:05] received salvation from destruction, but
[58:08] that's not the same as redemption.
[58:10] Redemption means I don't have to go to
[58:11] the tribulation at all. I don't have to
[58:13] go to the judgment bar. When I get
[58:15] there, my sins have already went ahead
[58:16] of me. They've been met in Christ, and I
[58:19] just I just get my assigned seat on the
[58:21] throne.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; You don't want to have your sins follow
[58:25] you there because then you have to stand
[58:27] trial. Now, every man will get a fair
[58:29] trial, but I don't want to stand trial.
[58:31] I'd rather I'd rather have my judgment
[58:33] now be in Christ. So, so even if you
[58:37] were, and I made that point, if you were
[58:39] foolish enough to go into a battle like
[58:42] that, you wouldn't survive very long.
[58:45] And and and and so then I I asked the
[58:48] and we went down a whole list. I went
[58:50] down a whole list. There were there was
[58:52] a number of rights reporting literature
[58:54] that you can find online.
[58:56] and and we know that if an American
[58:57] service member is captured, it's it's
[59:00] not so bad if it's a state that captures
[59:03] him that that that recognizes the Geneva
[59:06] Convention and and different uh rules of
[59:09] war. But if he's captured by a rogue
[59:11] state, thank you, sir. If he's captured
[59:13] by a rogue state that rejects basic
[59:15] human rights and international norms,
[59:18] then the danger is not merely his loss
[59:21] of freedom, which it would be if it was
[59:23] a a civilized state. He would still lose
[59:26] his freedom. But if it's a rogue state,
[59:29] he's going to he's in way more danger of
[59:31] losing more than just his freedom. And
[59:32] we went out a whole list of things the
[59:35] UN have reported that people have been
[59:37] tortured and abused and all kinds of
[59:40] things like that. And I and my whole
[59:42] burden tonight was that God did not put
[59:45] you here to believe a message to be a
[59:47] prisoner of war.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; God didn't put you here and give you a
[59:51] gene of God and give you the Holy Ghost
[59:53] and open your mind to his word to see
[59:55] you bound.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Whom the Son hath made free,
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; not set free. Whom the Son hath made
[1:00:04] free is free indeed.
[1:00:11] Because we find that Satan
[1:00:15] is the head of a rogue nation that is
[1:00:17] global.
[1:00:20] And because, and I say it that way on
[1:00:22] purpose because when you go to Matthew 4
[1:00:25] or Luke 4,
[1:00:28] Satan, the Bible doesn't say Satan
[1:00:32] showed Jesus the nations. It says he
[1:00:35] showed him the kingdoms.
[1:00:38] And so we're not just talking about uh
[1:00:41] uh Satan being the head of a rogue
[1:00:43] nation. He is the head of this nation.
[1:00:45] And this nation is quite rogue now from
[1:00:47] the word of God. It used to be founded
[1:00:49] on the principles of God. It went rogue
[1:00:51] many decades ago. And in fact is it was
[1:00:54] the last one that hadn't gone rogue and
[1:00:57] now the whole world has. And Satan is
[1:00:59] the god of the entire age and all the
[1:01:03] kingdoms of civilization that are on the
[1:01:06] face of the earth.
[1:01:08] So,
[1:01:10] so I'm glad when I read the Bible that I
[1:01:15] find that the promise tells me that the
[1:01:18] kingdoms of this world, it doesn't deny
[1:01:22] that the kingdoms of this world belong
[1:01:24] to somebody besides Christ. That even
[1:01:27] Satan, brother Brandon points that out
[1:01:29] in Luke 4, Matthew 4. He said when Satan
[1:01:32] said, "All of these kingdoms, they're
[1:01:34] mine. I'll give them to you if you'll
[1:01:35] fall down and worship me." He said Jesus
[1:01:36] never argued that point with him. He
[1:01:39] never denied, "Oh, they're not your
[1:01:40] kingdoms, they're my kingdoms." Jesus,
[1:01:42] but Jesus knew they were Satan's
[1:01:44] kingdoms under his control. But we find
[1:01:47] that Jesus knew he would come heir to
[1:01:50] them someday. So, Brother Brandon would
[1:01:52] say in in who is in the Israelite worthy
[1:01:55] of the gospel, Satan never Jesus never
[1:01:57] screamed at devils. He didn't have to.
[1:01:58] He knew who he would. He knew who he
[1:02:00] was. And he knew, brother Ram said he
[1:02:03] knew that his word would finally
[1:02:05] conquer. And I'm glad to know that while
[1:02:08] this world I, you know, is is controlled
[1:02:11] by Satan, but I'm glad to know that the
[1:02:14] kingdoms of this world will become the
[1:02:17] kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ,
[1:02:19] of his bride. And by the way, may I say
[1:02:22] that he's the Satan might be the the
[1:02:25] kingdoms of this world, but I'm not from
[1:02:27] this world.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; I don't have an allegiance to this
[1:02:30] world. I come from another world who and
[1:02:32] I have an allegiance to that king
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; and he has not put me here to be in
[1:02:38] bondage to this king
[1:02:41] that God does not intend for me to live
[1:02:44] in bondage and subjugation to the god of
[1:02:47] this evil age.
[1:02:49] Brother Brandham says notice this is how
[1:02:51] he Satan became the god of the age. They
[1:02:53] the people exalt him above all that's
[1:02:55] called God.
[1:03:00] And I'm not going to read it tonight,
[1:03:01] but brother Brandham had dealt with
[1:03:03] second Thessalonians. Doesn't second
[1:03:05] Thessalonians say they would do it? It
[1:03:08] does. It teaches that. And he's he's
[1:03:11] going to be worshiped as the Bible said
[1:03:14] above all that is called God. So he as
[1:03:18] God sets in the church of God proving
[1:03:22] that he is God because he's got the
[1:03:24] people worshiping him. God is the word.
[1:03:28] And so he exalts himself above all
[1:03:31] that's called God. How does he get to be
[1:03:34] a worshiped being like a God? How does
[1:03:37] he get treated like a God? Because he
[1:03:39] has placed himself above the word and
[1:03:43] people believe him instead of the word.
[1:03:46] You see how that works? So now he's the
[1:03:48] God because he has exalted himself above
[1:03:52] that which is called God. And when the
[1:03:55] people believe him instead of this, then
[1:03:57] he becomes the elected God of the age.
[1:04:03] He's praised for it. Oh, let the people
[1:04:06] God see that deception. He is praised
[1:04:10] for it and solemnly believed by the
[1:04:13] people of this evil age. Now, do you see
[1:04:15] the God and his servants of this evil
[1:04:18] age? Now, let's watch it be manifested.
[1:04:21] He says he is making a better world for
[1:04:25] them to live in. That's the promise of
[1:04:28] education and technology and and
[1:04:31] abundance and wealth and all this kind
[1:04:32] of stuff. That's the promise they make.
[1:04:34] It's funny, they've never been able to
[1:04:36] achieve it uh in 6,000 years of human
[1:04:39] history. And whenever they got close to
[1:04:40] it, it all fell apart right away. But he
[1:04:43] says here, he says he's ma, he says he's
[1:04:47] making a better world for them to live
[1:04:49] in by his knowledge apart from the never
[1:04:54] failing word of God. You know, my
[1:04:56] opinion, he's made a better world to sin
[1:05:00] in
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; instead of live in. And I'm here to tell
[1:05:04] you something, friend. A marker, a major
[1:05:07] marker of a real bornagain child of God
[1:05:11] is where you come down on those two
[1:05:13] differing opinions. The world has the
[1:05:15] opinion this is a better world to live
[1:05:17] in. But a prophet had a different
[1:05:19] opinion. Said no, it's a better world to
[1:05:21] sit in. Now what's your opinion on it?
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Because whatever your opinion that will
[1:05:27] testify, your life will testify which
[1:05:30] opinion you subscribe to.
[1:05:33] That kind of hits us between the eyes,
[1:05:34] doesn't it?
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Told you we were going to really look at
[1:05:37] these things practically.
[1:05:40] We know that decisions are made in the
[1:05:42] heart. As a man thinkketh in his heart,
[1:05:44] so is he. And meaning that, you know,
[1:05:46] that that that heart has a nature.
[1:05:48] Brother Brandham said it's governed by
[1:05:50] one of two natures, faith or unbelief.
[1:05:52] Either you are converted or you're not
[1:05:54] converted. You can you can have uh
[1:05:57] experiences in the Holy Ghost that don't
[1:06:00] lead to your conversion.
[1:06:02] The Holy Ghost can anoint your flesh. It
[1:06:04] anointed the flesh of Elvis Presley.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; You can have an anointing. You can have
[1:06:09] a work of the Holy Ghost on your spirit
[1:06:11] and it'll it'll give you a varying
[1:06:13] degree of sanctified life and it'll make
[1:06:16] you stop lying. It'll make you start
[1:06:17] going to church. You'll start become an
[1:06:20] honest man. The and the world is filled
[1:06:22] with good people. And God and God will
[1:06:24] have a place for that. You can read it
[1:06:26] in the book of Matthew the 25th chapter.
[1:06:28] There's a whole section of humanity that
[1:06:31] come to the judgment, the great white
[1:06:34] throne judgment, who are not born again.
[1:06:37] They do not have eternal life, but they
[1:06:39] lived as saints.
[1:06:42] They lived as righteous people and that
[1:06:45] because that their record shows that
[1:06:48] they that they had the right kind of
[1:06:50] heartfelt response to the word of God.
[1:06:52] Now, it wasn't earning your way. It's
[1:06:54] not about, you know, ex, you know, um, a
[1:06:58] balance scale. It's not that. I've got
[1:07:00] 900 good deeds and 850 bad deeds, so I
[1:07:02] get in. It's not that. You can't earn
[1:07:04] your way to eternal life like that.
[1:07:05] You'll never be granted eternal life on
[1:07:07] that basis. It was their what the king
[1:07:09] was looking at was their heart's
[1:07:12] response to the word when whenever they
[1:07:16] faced it, even when they didn't know
[1:07:17] they were facing it. Because if you'll
[1:07:20] notice that this group that was that
[1:07:22] perished tried to list their works and
[1:07:25] the king didn't deny their works. He
[1:07:28] just said your heart is full of
[1:07:30] iniquity. So it was a judgment of their
[1:07:32] heart. And these other people had done
[1:07:34] things and and because of how they had
[1:07:37] responded to the word maybe when they
[1:07:39] met you or they helped the bride or they
[1:07:41] were kind to the bride or maybe they
[1:07:43] just were went about the world as
[1:07:44] righteous people. You can see that in
[1:07:46] the Old Testament. You can see that Lot
[1:07:49] was a perfect type of that. He was never
[1:07:51] going to get Abraham's revelation. You
[1:07:53] can see Aimilec. The Bible says of Lot,
[1:07:57] Sodom vexed his righteous soul.
[1:08:00] You can see Aimilec, the Philistine
[1:08:02] king. He was never going to get
[1:08:04] Abraham's revelation. But yet God came
[1:08:07] to him and warned him. Said, "You've got
[1:08:08] another man's wife." And he said, "Lord,
[1:08:10] my goodness, you know the integrity of
[1:08:12] my heart. I would have never done that.
[1:08:13] That man lied to me. You know me, Lord."
[1:08:15] And the Lord acknowledged that. Yes, I
[1:08:18] do know the integrity of your heart.
[1:08:19] That's why I'm trying to keep you alive.
[1:08:21] Here's what you're going to have to do.
[1:08:22] You're going to have to take that man's
[1:08:23] wife back to him. Ask him to pray for
[1:08:25] you. That lying prophet. Yeah.
[1:08:29] I need to get this lying prophet to pray
[1:08:31] for me.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Or you won't be forgiven if you don't.
[1:08:34] Wow. Okay. I'll do it. Because Aimilec
[1:08:37] was used to doing whatever God told him.
[1:08:39] And it saved his nation. Saved him.
[1:08:43] Saved his kingdom. As they say, saved
[1:08:45] your bacon. I don't know what that
[1:08:46] means, but that's an old saying we used
[1:08:48] to say. And so it saved his whole nation
[1:08:52] of people. And and and we now we know
[1:08:55] that he was never going to get Abraham's
[1:08:57] revelation, but God recognized him. So
[1:08:59] you can see you can see Nicodemus
[1:09:02] uh in the in the Gospels. You can see
[1:09:05] all of these uh different ones that are
[1:09:08] you can see Galial, you can see all
[1:09:10] these different ones who didn't exactly
[1:09:12] have the full truth. never were never
[1:09:14] saw it, but yet they were they were
[1:09:17] sincere in what God had revealed to
[1:09:19] them. And God there's a there's a record
[1:09:20] of that. God keeps a record of that.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; See, and so those people didn't even
[1:09:26] know at the judgment bar what they had
[1:09:28] done to etern inherit eternal life. They
[1:09:30] were glad. I mean, it'd be like you and
[1:09:32] me. Lord, I really don't remember doing
[1:09:35] I mean, I'm glad I did it, but I really
[1:09:36] don't remember doing it. But if you say
[1:09:38] I did it, praise the Lord, I'll take it.
[1:09:41] And the Bible said, "Enter into the joys
[1:09:43] of the Lord prepared for you since the
[1:09:45] foundation of the world." Now, not
[1:09:46] before the foundation of the world,
[1:09:48] because that's only to Christ and his
[1:09:49] bride. Before the foundation, Ephesians
[1:09:51] 1. Every other place, uh, when it's not
[1:09:54] speaking of of the of the bride, it's
[1:09:57] since the foundation of the earth. But
[1:09:59] to Christ and to his bride, it's before
[1:10:01] the foundation of the world.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; All right? So this is how your name
[1:10:05] would be on the book of life, but yet
[1:10:07] also have your name in the in the
[1:10:09] special section of the lamb. That's
[1:10:11] that's election by origin. So that's
[1:10:14] God's doing. Now I got to keep moving.
[1:10:18] So So either you are converted or you're
[1:10:20] not inside of your soul, if you've got a
[1:10:24] gene of God, then that gene has become
[1:10:27] alive. The Holy Spirit revealed himself
[1:10:29] to you, revealed Christ, revealed the
[1:10:31] word. And in that revelation re revealed
[1:10:34] to you, not only did he give you the
[1:10:38] word to believe, but he gave you the
[1:10:41] faith to believe it.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; See, so it's not human faith. It's not
[1:10:48] faith uh uh just in the son of God. The
[1:10:52] unwise virgin have faith in the son of
[1:10:54] God. This is next level. This is the
[1:10:56] faith of the son of God, the Bible says.
[1:10:59] So he not only gave you the word to
[1:11:01] believe, but he gave you the faith to
[1:11:04] believe it. And that was a revelation.
[1:11:06] That's the mind of Christ. And that's a
[1:11:08] new birth. It's a personal revelation of
[1:11:12] Jesus Christ personally to you.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; And when that has transpired, then death
[1:11:19] nor hell or nothing can ever separate
[1:11:21] you from God. Height, death, famine,
[1:11:23] sword, peril, nothing can ever separate
[1:11:25] me from the love of God. I have passed
[1:11:27] from death to life. I could never come
[1:11:29] into the judgment.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; I am I am I am unindictable. I am a
[1:11:34] diplom I have diplomatic immunity. I'm
[1:11:36] no longer from here. I have a heavenly
[1:11:38] passport. I cannot be indicted. I cannot
[1:11:40] be arrested. I cannot be charged. I am
[1:11:42] an emissary of another kingdom.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; And and there is now therefore no
[1:11:48] condemnation to them which are in
[1:11:50] Christ. It's not even possible. God
[1:11:51] won't even hear the case. Can't even
[1:11:54] accuse God's family in front of him.
[1:11:57] So we find then that
[1:12:00] so so in your soul then you only have
[1:12:04] one of two natures either the one you
[1:12:06] were born with which is fallen that's
[1:12:08] why you have to be born again there's a
[1:12:10] number of things that Jesus has taught
[1:12:12] us that you must do and probably the
[1:12:17] foremost commandment is you must be born
[1:12:21] again
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; fail at every other thing But you must
[1:12:26] be born again. So,
[1:12:31] so when we see that it comes to
[1:12:33] believing the word of God and that is a
[1:12:35] revelation and then you are born again,
[1:12:37] then Paul's Paul admits that at one time
[1:12:40] we all just like everybody else had a
[1:12:42] fallen nature. We were all the children
[1:12:44] of wrath. This is why we don't judge
[1:12:46] people because we were all just like
[1:12:47] them. If God had not left us a seed, we
[1:12:50] would too would be alltogether like unto
[1:12:52] Sodom and Gomorrah. So we don't judge
[1:12:54] the world. We try to persuade them that
[1:12:57] there's another way. You don't have to
[1:12:58] die. Why would you die? Come to Christ
[1:13:00] and live. See, so we're not we're not
[1:13:03] here to judge the world. I know people
[1:13:05] think that sometimes because we preach
[1:13:07] the gospel. Um and and and we we do have
[1:13:11] the right to to identify fruits and
[1:13:14] things by the word of God simply because
[1:13:16] we have the book so clear. But you know,
[1:13:19] I'm not I said I remember one time, you
[1:13:21] know, somebody saying to me, "Oh, you're
[1:13:23] you're judging me." you know, I'm
[1:13:25] speaking about their lifestyle. I said,
[1:13:26] 'N no, I'm not judging you at all. Your
[1:13:29] lifestyle is between you and God. I'm
[1:13:31] only telling you what the word says,
[1:13:34] what God likes and what he doesn't, and
[1:13:35] what he says he'll do about what he
[1:13:37] doesn't like and what he says he'll do
[1:13:39] about what he likes. It's up to you.
[1:13:41] It's not up to me to make you believe
[1:13:43] it. I'm not. And in fact is I'm not
[1:13:45] judging you. I'm actually judging me.
[1:13:48] I'm simply saying the lifestyle you're
[1:13:50] living, I don't want that. I'm judging
[1:13:52] me that that lifestyle is not what I
[1:13:54] want. I want this kind of a lifestyle.
[1:13:57] And if that sounds to you like I'm
[1:13:59] judging you, well, I'm sorry. If the
[1:14:01] shoe fits, then wear it. And if the shoe
[1:14:04] uh you know, if you don't and if you
[1:14:05] don't like the shoe, then grow and then
[1:14:07] it won't fit anymore.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Just just get some
[1:14:12] spiritual growth to you and the word
[1:14:14] won't beat you up so bad.
[1:14:17] Let me change. Word won't spank you so
[1:14:19] so so often.
[1:14:22] So either you are converted or you're
[1:14:24] not converted. But the the Holy Ghost,
[1:14:27] the Zoey life of your converted nature.
[1:14:32] Now here's a big practical point. You
[1:14:35] ready for this? Say, "I'm born again."
[1:14:38] How many believe you're born again? Now
[1:14:40] you already know that's a gene of God
[1:14:41] coming to life. See? Say, "All right,
[1:14:44] then I've had a nature change." Praise
[1:14:46] the Lord. I've got I've got a gene of
[1:14:49] God. Zoe life and it's come to life and
[1:14:51] it's the seed of God. Amen. All right.
[1:14:55] But the Holy Ghost, the Zoey life of
[1:14:58] your converted nature feeds on the
[1:15:02] things of God in order to be strong.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; In order for it to be strong against the
[1:15:11] still fallen nature of your flesh.
[1:15:15] You're still in an unredeemed body. You
[1:15:19] still have unredeemed senses. Your
[1:15:21] sight, your smelling, your tasting, your
[1:15:24] touching, your all your hearing, your
[1:15:26] memories, your reasoning, your
[1:15:28] conscience, your affections, your
[1:15:30] imaginations, they're all unconverted.
[1:15:33] And when you're when you're born in sin
[1:15:35] and go through life, you have no battle.
[1:15:37] All three levels, body, spirit, and soul
[1:15:39] are all dark. But when you become born
[1:15:42] again by the spirit of God, now you've
[1:15:44] got an insight of the inside different
[1:15:46] kind of a life that is that and now it's
[1:15:49] all for control of the mind if in the
[1:15:52] spirit in your heart because now you've
[1:15:54] been converted but but your memory
[1:15:57] reason conscious imagination still want
[1:15:59] to do evil. Paul said when I would do
[1:16:01] good evil is still present.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; See and so how can I overcome it? I
[1:16:06] thank God by Jesus Christ. So the only
[1:16:08] way you'll be an overcomer is to feed on
[1:16:11] the life that gave you life.
[1:16:16] It's the greatest battle ever fought.
[1:16:18] And you need to win it
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; if you're going to be successful.
[1:16:25] God equipped you with every necessary
[1:16:28] resource to do just that. But Satan's
[1:16:32] Eden, hear me, Satan's Eden isn't going
[1:16:36] away.
[1:16:39] You have to distance yourself from it.
[1:16:43] It ain't going nowhere.
[1:16:45] You have to distance yourself from it.
[1:16:50] We know that the armies of heaven, the
[1:16:52] Bible speaks of, have always been the
[1:16:54] elected sons and daughters of the great
[1:16:56] king, who is the same as the King of
[1:16:58] Kings. He rules all the heavens above
[1:17:00] and the earth below. And for over 4,000
[1:17:03] years covering the uh era of the Old
[1:17:06] Testament, he he led his kingdoms
[1:17:09] through prophets, both major prophets
[1:17:11] and minor prophets, and to ga and and it
[1:17:14] was their job to gather his seed from
[1:17:16] wherever they were uh in the earth. Now,
[1:17:20] the remaining 2,000 years of earth's
[1:17:23] history would be a time that he would
[1:17:25] use to gather a gentile bride. And
[1:17:28] that's where John when he saw the throne
[1:17:31] room, he saw seven spirits of God
[1:17:33] standing near the throne in in
[1:17:35] Revelation chapter 4. And that is seven
[1:17:38] manifestations of the Holy Ghost that
[1:17:40] would work in concert with the seven
[1:17:43] stars that were held in the hands the
[1:17:45] right hand of God, which would be seven
[1:17:48] earthly messengers anointed through
[1:17:50] those seven spirits of God.
[1:17:52] You follow that?
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; It was a brilliant plan. It worked
[1:17:57] flawlessly over seven ages, seven church
[1:18:01] ages of times. Now, these seven stars in
[1:18:05] his right hand who were who were
[1:18:08] anointed by the seven spirits of God,
[1:18:10] the Holy Ghost to anoint them for their
[1:18:12] age, they they were generals, you know,
[1:18:15] as it were. We talked about warfare and
[1:18:18] and and I remember, you know, the
[1:18:20] beginning of last time we we talked
[1:18:22] about why why would you why would you
[1:18:24] think spiritual warfare was different
[1:18:26] from natural warfare? You said you
[1:18:28] wouldn't go into a natural warfare
[1:18:30] against a superior enemy unequipped and
[1:18:32] untrained. Why would you do that in in
[1:18:35] spiritual warfare?
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Why do you think you would have any more
[1:18:38] success in spiritual warfare?
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Wow. if you wouldn't have it in natural
[1:18:42] warfare. You yourself said you knew you
[1:18:45] would die in the first few minutes of
[1:18:46] battle or get captured and lose your
[1:18:49] freedom and even worse. And I hate to
[1:18:51] see God's family as PS.
[1:18:55] So, so we realize then that God sent us
[1:18:58] these seven generals and and and these
[1:19:02] seven generals were subject to the king
[1:19:04] at all times. I remember some time ago I
[1:19:06] stumbled quite accidentally upon a
[1:19:08] humorous clip. I have no idea what it
[1:19:10] was. It was a a real that I I was
[1:19:13] looking at something else and it popped
[1:19:14] up and and it was supposed to be funny
[1:19:17] and I played it and I don't even know
[1:19:19] what it was or who it was. So don't ask
[1:19:20] me after church cuz I couldn't tell you.
[1:19:22] But I remember this cuz it was it was
[1:19:23] amusing to me. And some CEO is giving,
[1:19:27] you know, telling he's got one of his
[1:19:29] his junior vice presidents in his
[1:19:31] office. I need you to do this and this.
[1:19:32] I need you to go here. I need you to do
[1:19:33] that. Do this. And the guy's kind of
[1:19:35] objecting. Sir, you know, I don't Are
[1:19:37] you sure it's a good idea? I don't know.
[1:19:38] Yeah, just trust me. Just go do it. Just
[1:19:40] go do it. And the guy walks out the door
[1:19:43] and he go and he turns around and he's
[1:19:45] got one last harrah. And he says, he
[1:19:48] says, "But sir," he says, "you know, you
[1:19:51] you hired me to do this to be in this
[1:19:53] position and you know, are you sure? Why
[1:19:56] are you giving me an order? Why why did
[1:19:57] you hire me for it?" And the CEO walks
[1:20:00] over to him and he says says, "Oh, I am
[1:20:05] so sorry. I I apologize. I realize now I
[1:20:08] made that sound like a request
[1:20:15] and you did what I did. It was funny.
[1:20:17] But the the thing that I want I want you
[1:20:20] to understand is that when orders are
[1:20:22] issued from the royal throne down to his
[1:20:26] generals who relayed them down to to the
[1:20:30] command staff which we said last time
[1:20:32] was five-fold ministry who then relay
[1:20:34] them to the fighting force which is you.
[1:20:37] Then when that happens, they come as
[1:20:39] royal decrees, as royal directives, as
[1:20:43] royal commands. And the Holy Ghost, the
[1:20:46] supreme allied commander of all heavenly
[1:20:50] armies, expects that you will obey them.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; They're not requests.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; They're commands. And you know, I wanted
[1:21:01] to say to you tonight, friends, for some
[1:21:03] for some people who, you know, chafe
[1:21:06] under that, you love his commands. David
[1:21:09] loved his his commands. David loved his
[1:21:11] laws. David loved his words. And you
[1:21:14] love his words. And I'm here to tell you
[1:21:15] something, friends. They work in your
[1:21:18] favor. the the the scripture the
[1:21:21] scriptures alone describe a a a a level
[1:21:25] of divine favoritism that is
[1:21:28] unparalleled and unequaled in the world.
[1:21:31] You say favoritism is a good thing when
[1:21:34] God has it. It it's a good thing. And
[1:21:36] God chose you before the foundation of
[1:21:39] the world. He chose you in Christ and
[1:21:42] positionally placed you. You talking
[1:21:44] about favoritism? Amen.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; See, he offers a legitimate chance to
[1:21:49] all men to save themselves from
[1:21:51] destruction. But that's but his family,
[1:21:54] that's a whole next level. See, so we
[1:21:58] love those laws. The B, listen, the
[1:22:00] Bible tells us in the first chapter of
[1:22:02] Revelation, uh, he hath made us kings
[1:22:06] and priests unto God. You love that one.
[1:22:08] And we shall reign with him forever and
[1:22:10] ever. You love that one. Hey, he told
[1:22:13] the devil, don't see, you know, touch
[1:22:15] not the oil and the wine, which is which
[1:22:18] is God's revelation of his word to you
[1:22:21] and the joy you get out of believing it.
[1:22:23] And so that no matter how hard the trial
[1:22:25] gets and no matter what God allows the
[1:22:27] devil to to do to you or puts you
[1:22:29] through, he's commanded, don't touch the
[1:22:31] revelation,
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; at the end of the day, they're still
[1:22:34] going to have the joy of the revelation.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; You love that law. You love that the
[1:22:41] devil has to obey that.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; so that means that no matter what the
[1:22:47] trouble is, no matter what Satan can do
[1:22:49] and whatever trial it is, I know it'll
[1:22:52] be for my good. It cannot touch that
[1:22:54] revelation. I love that command. So, so
[1:23:00] don't don't find yourself
[1:23:04] only loving the commands of God's word
[1:23:06] that you like.
[1:23:09] Wow.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Love all of them.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; And if you've got a problem with some of
[1:23:15] God's laws, why don't you just say,
[1:23:16] "Lord, tonight, change my heart, oh God.
[1:23:20] Change my heart, oh God. Cause me like
[1:23:22] be like David. I want to love your law.
[1:23:25] I want to love your words." See, so
[1:23:31] humanity would finally come to an end of
[1:23:34] all of its years. 4,000 years of Old
[1:23:36] Testament, 2,000 years of New Testament,
[1:23:39] the last uh lives being lived out. And
[1:23:43] when the last lives are being lived out
[1:23:46] that were to ever be on the book of
[1:23:49] life, then I'm here to tell you there
[1:23:52] won't be any more names added to that
[1:23:54] book. And life as we know it will
[1:23:57] change. It will end for many. And we
[1:24:01] call it the end of the world. But here
[1:24:03] here's here, you know, and it's often
[1:24:05] called the the last days. We call it
[1:24:08] that, the last days. And it's mankind's
[1:24:10] 6,000-year run in a fallen condition.
[1:24:12] You've heard me call it that before. And
[1:24:14] it's going to come, according to the
[1:24:15] Bible, 6,000 years is going to to come
[1:24:18] to a a very sudden and inglorious end.
[1:24:22] But the beauty of it is is it wouldn't
[1:24:25] be the end for everyone. For some, it
[1:24:29] would be the beginning. And that's me.
[1:24:31] It's not an end. The the last days are
[1:24:34] not my end. The last days mean I've got
[1:24:36] a new beginning coming.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; See, it's a brand new beginning that
[1:24:40] will never end.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; A joy unescribable
[1:24:45] even from this side. a prophet. My a
[1:24:47] prophet I mean if it's a joy almost
[1:24:50] indescribable on this side and a prophet
[1:24:53] went to the other side and and and and
[1:24:56] when he when he comes back he tries to
[1:24:58] describe it tries to describe that joy
[1:25:02] but he couldn't even find the words to
[1:25:04] say. See so so I I I know I came from
[1:25:09] the mind of God but I haven't went
[1:25:11] there. I haven't perfectly um
[1:25:14] experienced that like a prophet did, but
[1:25:16] I've heard about it. I've heard about
[1:25:18] it. That same general that did that uh
[1:25:21] he he reported how one of these days
[1:25:23] when I cross over, I'll I'll I'll be on
[1:25:26] the other side and might think of
[1:25:27] something that I was so worried about on
[1:25:29] this side and sit down under a tree and
[1:25:31] just laugh about it.
[1:25:33] Won't that be a time, friends, to just
[1:25:36] think that your trials here, as Paul
[1:25:38] said, they won't even be worth
[1:25:40] discussing.
[1:25:42] Oh my goodness. So, I know this that the
[1:25:45] love of God was projected to me. I know
[1:25:48] that grace took over my life. It saved
[1:25:50] me from a devil's hell. And like Job,
[1:25:52] like Job says in Job 42, I have heard of
[1:25:55] thee by the hearing of the ear, but now
[1:25:58] mine eye seeth thee. That's the desire
[1:26:02] of my heart tonight, friends, is that
[1:26:05] you will see God more clearly and that
[1:26:07] you will see that this war first that we
[1:26:10] are in a war. And I remember last time
[1:26:13] in part one of last Wednesday, I I asked
[1:26:17] you which would you be more concerned
[1:26:19] about, natural war, spiritual war? And
[1:26:22] it was a legitimate question. Natural
[1:26:25] war is tanks and planes and guns and
[1:26:27] bombs and missiles and drones and and
[1:26:29] poison, radiation, all this kind of
[1:26:31] stuff and you know and machine guns and
[1:26:33] you get killed and don't even you don't
[1:26:35] hear it coming. Which is worse to you in
[1:26:38] your mind? Natural war, spiritual war.
[1:26:41] Now in our human frailty, we would all
[1:26:44] go, "Man, natural war, well that's
[1:26:45] pretty scary. I'd be pretty scared. But
[1:26:47] spiritual war, I can just keep fighting
[1:26:49] the devil." But actually, Jesus was just
[1:26:52] the opposite. He said, "Don't even fear
[1:26:54] the one that can hurt your body, but
[1:26:56] fear the one that can take your body and
[1:26:58] your soul to hell." So, the spiritual
[1:27:01] warfare, and I and I put this to you,
[1:27:03] and I hope it didn't hurt your feelings,
[1:27:06] but I did it I said it to help you. If
[1:27:09] you if you're of the school of thinking
[1:27:11] that natural war is worse than spiritual
[1:27:14] war, that natural warfare is worse than
[1:27:17] spiritual warfare, then that might help
[1:27:20] explain why you fail. So often in
[1:27:22] spiritual warfare
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; because you don't put it as as more
[1:27:26] important than natural warfare, you
[1:27:29] don't realize that that that the the
[1:27:31] Holy Ghost inside you feeds on the word
[1:27:34] of God and contaminants of the world
[1:27:37] poison that. You say, "But I thought I
[1:27:39] had the Holy Ghost. I thought I was born
[1:27:41] again." You're still in an unredeemed
[1:27:42] body. And that Holy Ghost, Brother
[1:27:45] Brandham said, it's like the white dog,
[1:27:47] black dog. Which one's stronger?
[1:27:48] Whichever one I feed the most. These are
[1:27:50] practical truths that we have to absorb
[1:27:53] if you want to be an overcomer. Or do
[1:27:55] you what would you rather live a life of
[1:27:56] a prisoner of war? I'm done being a
[1:27:58] prisoner of war. I don't want I don't
[1:28:00] want to be I don't want you to be a
[1:28:01] prisoner of war. I want to see the pride
[1:28:03] of Christ free in the spirit of God.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Not a prisoner to Satan's tyranny.
[1:28:11] So,
[1:28:19] I want to come to this before I close.
[1:28:20] I'm going to wrap it up in seven
[1:28:22] minutes.
[1:28:25] When I when I study the people of God in
[1:28:29] the Bible and I I ponder this the
[1:28:32] statements that brother Brandham and
[1:28:34] other great servants of the Lord have
[1:28:37] made along with my own personal
[1:28:39] experience and I'm here to to share some
[1:28:41] because I've got a lot of it got a lot
[1:28:43] of personal experience and and I can see
[1:28:46] friends that even if you are now I I I'm
[1:28:51] going to I'm glad I'm ending with this
[1:28:53] because I I want I want I'm going to
[1:28:55] leave you with this penetrating thought
[1:28:59] that I can see from my own experience,
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; from things I've heard brother Brandham
[1:29:05] say, from things other great men of God
[1:29:07] have said, from things in the scripture,
[1:29:10] I can see that even if you are his
[1:29:13] elected child, there's a path that's not
[1:29:18] exactly the Lord's perfect path for you,
[1:29:22] but it's a path that he will let you
[1:29:24] walk on if that's your choice.
[1:29:30] It's not exactly, you know, a perfect
[1:29:33] path. And and and and you'll be a
[1:29:37] believer.
[1:29:38] See, and you you'll live at and I I
[1:29:42] wanted to use a different word because I
[1:29:44] don't want you to correlate if I say
[1:29:45] varying degrees of sanctification.
[1:29:46] That's a that's a a a mashup that
[1:29:50] Brother Brandham used for the unwise
[1:29:52] virgin, the foolish virgin. I'm not
[1:29:54] talking about them. I'm I'm Let's make
[1:29:56] that real clear. I'm not talking about
[1:29:58] There's plenty of sermons I can preach
[1:29:59] to people who have never been born
[1:30:01] again. That's not what this sermon is
[1:30:02] about tonight. That's not what it's
[1:30:03] about Wednesday night. I'm preaching to
[1:30:06] people who are his children, who do have
[1:30:08] a seed of God, who have believed the
[1:30:10] word, who have had an experience of the
[1:30:12] new birth, whose gene of God has come to
[1:30:14] life. Even you still need to feed the
[1:30:18] Holy Ghost
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; the things of God.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; And you need to stop poisoning him with
[1:30:23] the things of the world.
[1:30:26] And there is a path even to you believer
[1:30:28] seed gene bearer, son and daughter of
[1:30:31] God who's passed from death unto life.
[1:30:34] There is a path that God will allow you
[1:30:36] to walk on that's not exactly his
[1:30:39] perfect path for you. And he'll allow
[1:30:41] you to walk on there for a little while
[1:30:42] if that's your choice. And when you do
[1:30:45] that, you'll find yourself up and down
[1:30:48] and in and out and on and off. And
[1:30:53] you'll find yourself way up
[1:30:56] and you're great until you're not. And
[1:30:58] you're crashing all the way down.
[1:31:02] And you live a life as a child of God
[1:31:05] with a gene of God who's had an
[1:31:07] experience of God. But yet you you
[1:31:10] choose to let the God of this evil age
[1:31:14] woo you into this quasi no man's land
[1:31:17] where you're not a believer. You haven't
[1:31:18] lost your your reward. Yeah. But you
[1:31:21] know there's a lot of things about the
[1:31:23] joy of your salvation that Satan can
[1:31:25] tamper with. And David was keenly aware
[1:31:28] of that. Lord, you know, we we dealt
[1:31:30] with that last time. Create me a clean
[1:31:32] heart. Renew a right spirit in me. I'm
[1:31:34] glad that the Holy Spirit is is a
[1:31:36] renewing factor. But I'm here to tell
[1:31:38] you something, friends. We have got to
[1:31:40] come to a place right here in these last
[1:31:43] days, these last closing scenes of
[1:31:45] history. I am not interested in walking
[1:31:47] in some no man's land of of up and down
[1:31:51] and and on fire and then I'm cooled off
[1:31:53] and I'm on fire and then I'm cooled off
[1:31:54] and then I'm in and then I'm out and
[1:31:55] then I'm on and then I'm off. Then I'm
[1:31:56] up and then I'm down and then I'm in
[1:31:58] church and then I'm not and then I'm I'm
[1:32:00] you know, I'm doing what I need to do
[1:32:01] with my family until I'm not. I I I I
[1:32:03] believe that the bride of the last day
[1:32:05] needs to be walking in the step of the
[1:32:07] gospel, marching onward. Christian
[1:32:10] soldiers, there's a rhythm to that song.
[1:32:12] There's a beat to that song. And you
[1:32:14] don't get off beat or everybody knows
[1:32:16] it.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Get off beat. Get out of tune. Get out
[1:32:19] of key. Break the rhythm. Everybody that
[1:32:22] are the musicians of the heavenly choir
[1:32:24] will know you're not hiding it from
[1:32:26] anybody. The only person you might be
[1:32:28] hiding it from is your own self. But God
[1:32:31] has not called you to that. God has
[1:32:33] called you to be free. God has called
[1:32:36] you to soar as eagles.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; It's true, isn't it?
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; It's true. That in between area
[1:32:46] where you're certainly a believing child
[1:32:48] of God truly believes
[1:32:51] with all your heart. But sometimes we
[1:32:55] allow our overall life to be one that I
[1:32:58] might put in caps tonight called
[1:33:01] spiritual ease. You're not a hypocrite.
[1:33:05] You're not a secret sinner. But it's a
[1:33:08] path that though a a halfway no man's
[1:33:11] land that has you living just under real
[1:33:17] ferveny for the Lord and you know it.
[1:33:22] The Lord still speaks to you.
[1:33:25] The Lord still visits you. But he often
[1:33:29] finds you languishing along the edges of
[1:33:32] carnality
[1:33:35] for comfort's sake, for acceptance sake,
[1:33:40] for social acceptance sake.
[1:33:44] I
[1:33:46] I don't want him to find me like that.
[1:33:48] Wow.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; That's that's a real burden of my heart,
[1:33:52] friends, in this last day. And I know I
[1:33:55] know you're quiet. And that's how I felt
[1:33:56] when I started studying this. I got real
[1:33:59] quiet. And I just said, "Lord,
[1:34:03] I
[1:34:04] I don't want that to be my world.
[1:34:08] I want to be like an eagle. I want to
[1:34:12] soar in the heavenlies. I don't want to
[1:34:15] just be a believer. I don't want you to
[1:34:17] I don't want to have you where you you
[1:34:19] oh you still speak to me. You still
[1:34:21] anoint me. You still hear my prayers.
[1:34:23] You still bless me. You still do all
[1:34:24] these things. But you often find me
[1:34:27] languishing along the edges of
[1:34:29] carnality. Friends, why don't you bow
[1:34:32] your heads with me across the building
[1:34:33] tonight?
[1:34:37] Brother Matt, bring your team quietly.
[1:34:44] Lord Jesus,
[1:34:46] tonight, Master, we are in your
[1:34:50] presence, Father, and we're grateful to
[1:34:52] be so.
[1:34:54] And I am so aware, Lord, of the the
[1:34:59] gripping truths that come out of your
[1:35:01] word last Wednesday. Tonight, now, Lord,
[1:35:04] we've taken another portion of it.
[1:35:08] And I think about Lord uh uh uh brother
[1:35:11] Brandham talking about that now was the
[1:35:14] time that we need to be walking a
[1:35:16] straight line.
[1:35:18] Lord, one of the last messages of his
[1:35:20] ministry. He's just he's less than a
[1:35:23] month from leaving the scene. December
[1:35:26] 1965.
[1:35:28] That's what we have to do as soldiers of
[1:35:30] the cross. He says, see, he says, he
[1:35:34] says, you you had a time making your
[1:35:37] first couple steps. You toddle and fall
[1:35:39] and you get up and try it again. Then
[1:35:41] after a while, you get so you can walk a
[1:35:43] straight line. And that's what we have
[1:35:45] to do as soldiers of the cross. Now is
[1:35:48] time to walk a straight line right down
[1:35:52] that highway to glory.
[1:35:59] Sinful transgressions, friends, while
[1:36:02] your heads are bowed,
[1:36:04] hear me.
[1:36:06] Sinful transgressions
[1:36:10] come into your life
[1:36:12] from living
[1:36:14] in sinful ways.
[1:36:17] And I don't mean they have to be heinous
[1:36:19] sins, just those edges of carnality
[1:36:23] that we feed on that and we don't we
[1:36:26] don't give ourselves a diet of the word
[1:36:29] of God like we should and we know it.
[1:36:32] We're all guilty. We're all with our
[1:36:34] heads and hearts bowed in this building
[1:36:36] tonight. I'm sure out across the
[1:36:37] airwaves, hands are up and hearts are
[1:36:40] bowed also before the Lord. And I just
[1:36:43] want to invite you with me.
[1:36:46] And tonight when we come forward to take
[1:36:50] up our prayer request to the Lord, could
[1:36:53] we start by just let's just rise up out
[1:36:56] of our seats right now and walk down
[1:36:57] here and say, "Lord, I'm coming down
[1:37:00] tonight. I want to stand with the family
[1:37:02] of God." Come on, if you feel this way,
[1:37:04] say, "Lord, I want to stand with the
[1:37:06] family of God that's pure, that's
[1:37:08] strong." Come on forward, friends. Don't
[1:37:11] be afraid. I'm going to come down here
[1:37:13] and meet you right here because that's
[1:37:14] the great desire of my heart
[1:37:19] to come together as the family of God to
[1:37:22] we're going to take up our prayer
[1:37:23] request just in a moment. But I just
[1:37:26] want our hearts and minds and it's
[1:37:28] perfectly fine if if you're seated where
[1:37:30] you are just stay right there and be
[1:37:32] prayerful.
[1:37:34] I understand we have people in positions
[1:37:37] that can't even leave their post, but
[1:37:39] everybody just be prayerful.
[1:37:42] For those of you who can come on up as
[1:37:43] close as you can. Amen. Amen.
[1:37:48] Now bow your heads with me once more.
[1:37:52] Master, now I bow my head with these
[1:37:55] people.
[1:37:57] We stand before you, Lord, as honest as
[1:37:59] we know how.
[1:38:01] We look within ourselves, Lord God.
[1:38:03] We're believers. We sure are. I sure am.
[1:38:08] I'm a believer for real. And I know
[1:38:10] these people are. I know they love you.
[1:38:13] I know I do. I know they really do. I
[1:38:17] really do love you, Lord. I really do.
[1:38:20] We really do believe every word. It is
[1:38:23] our desire to be the word made alive. We
[1:38:27] want to be written epistles read of all
[1:38:29] men. Lord, we walk around in this
[1:38:32] Satan's Eden. It's such a dark place.
[1:38:34] We're in unredeemed bodies. Oh, we feel
[1:38:37] like the Apostle Paul, when I would do
[1:38:39] good, evil is present. Who shall deliver
[1:38:42] me from this body of death? There's only
[1:38:45] one answer that came to the mind of your
[1:38:47] apostle and that was in Jesus Christ.
[1:38:51] So Lord, may you show us tonight, each
[1:38:55] and every one of us individually, may
[1:38:57] you write, come up alongside of us,
[1:38:58] Lord, as a doctor and write us an
[1:39:01] individual prescription. The
[1:39:02] prescription you write for me might not
[1:39:04] be uh the one you'd write for brother
[1:39:06] Mark. The one you'd write for brother
[1:39:08] Mark might not be the one you'd write
[1:39:09] for brother Ken. You might write a
[1:39:11] different a completely different one
[1:39:13] that you'd write for Sister Jean. You
[1:39:14] might write a totally different one to
[1:39:16] Sister Brenda. But whatever you need to
[1:39:19] write on that prescription and say,
[1:39:20] "Child, I know you love me. I know you
[1:39:23] believe me. I know you're a believer.
[1:39:25] You are my child. You're not wrong. You
[1:39:28] are. And I've got a prescription I'm
[1:39:30] going to write out here. and it's just
[1:39:32] to you alone. And when I write it and
[1:39:34] give it to you in your heart, you're
[1:39:36] going to know what you need to do. It's
[1:39:39] not going to be a mystery to you. You're
[1:39:41] going to be able to think of ways that
[1:39:43] you know I have found you along the
[1:39:45] edges of carnality all too many times.
[1:39:49] And I'm I'm writing you. I'm your great
[1:39:52] physician. And I'm writing you a
[1:39:54] spiritual medicine that you can get and
[1:39:56] the Holy Ghost will fill it. Just hand
[1:39:57] it to him right at the counter and he'll
[1:39:59] fill it for you right on the spot. Lord,
[1:40:02] may it be so tonight. I know what my
[1:40:04] prescription says. I can read it clear
[1:40:06] as a bell. I know every gap, every hole,
[1:40:10] every low place in the road of my life.
[1:40:12] Lord, I know where the I can see the
[1:40:15] road. I can see it. But my flesh
[1:40:18] oftentimes wants that side trail. Lord,
[1:40:20] don't let that be my life. Don't let
[1:40:23] that be our lives. Lord, we realize we
[1:40:25] are at the closing scenes of this
[1:40:28] world's history. And I want to know that
[1:40:31] I'm not walking in a permissive way. I'm
[1:40:33] walking in the perfect light of God's
[1:40:36] word for me.
[1:40:39] I pray you'll grant it, Lord, tonight. I
[1:40:41] didn't expect, Lord Jesus. You know,
[1:40:43] it's not anywhere in my notes. I didn't
[1:40:46] expect to end the service like this
[1:40:48] saying these things, but it comes to me
[1:40:51] under inspiration, and I know it's
[1:40:53] helping people. sure is helping me. So
[1:40:56] Lord, we commit these things into your
[1:40:58] hands. I commit last Wednesday's
[1:41:00] service, tonight's service, every
[1:41:02] service of course, but these two
[1:41:04] particular part one, part two, sin, sin
[1:41:07] comes from sinful lives. Transgression
[1:41:11] comes from these things.
[1:41:14] God, you want us to be free. You want us
[1:41:16] to live above it. You want us to fly
[1:41:18] high.
[1:41:20] the the God of this age should have no
[1:41:22] sway in my life.
[1:41:26] So I commit it to you now, master, the
[1:41:29] remainder of this evening, all the
[1:41:31] coming days, Lord. I've so I' I've
[1:41:34] preached the word now. I've swn it like
[1:41:35] a seed and I know it's good seed. It's
[1:41:38] the gospel seed and it'll come forth.
[1:41:40] May the Holy Spirit water it day and
[1:41:42] night, Lord. I pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:41:46] Amen. Sing for us, brother.
[1:41:52] [Music]

[1:41:58] saturate
[1:42:01] my thirsty soul.

[1:42:26] you now.
[1:42:28] Pour your spirit
[1:42:30] out
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; again. Hallelujah.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Pour it, Lord.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, I seek you.
[1:42:41] Help me find you.
[1:42:45] How I need your touch.
[1:42:51] [Music]
[1:42:53] Find my dry and
[1:42:58] broken places
[1:43:02] thirsty for your love.
[1:43:10] Lord, forgive me
[1:43:14] if I've wondered
[1:43:19] far away from you.
[1:43:23] [Music]
[1:43:27] You are all I
[1:43:31] ever needed.
[1:43:35] Come and make me new.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; You pour your spirit out on me.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Fall just like the rain.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's worship him, friends. Raise up
[1:43:51] those hands and worship.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Saturate
[1:43:55] my thirsty soul.
[1:43:59] Come and fall aresh on me.
[1:44:04] Fill my cup again.
[1:44:07] [Music]
[1:44:09] Heal my heart
[1:44:12] and make me whole.
[1:44:18] I need
[1:44:20] you now.
[1:44:22] pour your spirit
[1:44:25] out.
[1:44:29] Brother Luther writes, "Let's remember
[1:44:31] Sister Angie Heth in Montana.
[1:44:35] Had a scat scan two days ago, is on her
[1:44:38] way to a doctor's appointment. Doctor
[1:44:40] may want to put her on meds again. She
[1:44:42] isn't sure what to tell him. She's
[1:44:44] believing for a clear cat scan. Also,
[1:44:48] I'm under the weather today. dry,
[1:44:49] scratchy throat, low-grade fever, runny
[1:44:51] nose, bit of a cough. Brother Bruce
[1:44:53] Parish writes, "Please remember Sister
[1:44:55] Linda in prayer this evening as she's
[1:44:58] been suffering with a severe headache.
[1:45:00] Thanks and God bless you." Katie Watkins
[1:45:03] uh has a request for Oakley, her dog
[1:45:05] tonight. He got into something, got very
[1:45:07] sick for the last day, day and a half,
[1:45:10] not eating, drinking, uh acting very
[1:45:12] strange. They think he ate something or
[1:45:15] got in contact with something. They
[1:45:16] don't really know. all day today. She
[1:45:18] was just just trying to decide whether
[1:45:21] to take him to the vet. I was praying
[1:45:23] for him. Chris tells me the Lord has
[1:45:25] touched him and he's made some
[1:45:27] improvement. Want to keep praying for
[1:45:29] him tonight. I also know that many of
[1:45:32] you tonight um would have an unspoken
[1:45:36] request to the Lord. You want to raise
[1:45:37] up that hand to the Lord. Amen. God sees
[1:45:40] all of those unspoken request. Amen.
[1:45:43] Join with somebody standing near you.
[1:45:45] Let's pray.
[1:45:47] Amen. Amen.
[1:45:52] Matt, why don't you come help me here,
[1:45:53] son?
[1:45:55] And um
[1:45:57] these are that's the one from brother
[1:45:59] Luther, brother brother Bruce Katie and
[1:46:03] and um
[1:46:06] we have unspoken request also. Amen. Go
[1:46:09] ahead.
[1:46:13] Brothers and sisters,
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; great for you as you said to Abraham. Is
[1:46:20] anything too hard for the Lord? Lord,
[1:46:22] truly nothing is too hard.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Father, all these needs that have been
[1:46:26] written down from brother Luther, Lord,
[1:46:28] you see this need, this Lord, this
[1:46:31] issue. Father, we're just believing with
[1:46:33] our sister, Lord, our brother, for a
[1:46:36] clear cat scan. You can do it, Lord
[1:46:38] Jesus. We believe that you're the God of
[1:46:40] miracles. You're the same yesterday,
[1:46:42] today, and forever. Lord God, you said
[1:46:44] in your word if you would believe and
[1:46:46] ask anything in my name. And don't
[1:46:48] doubt. You'll have what you ask for. So
[1:46:51] Lord, we come asking in faith, Lord.
[1:46:54] Father, agreeing in faith together,
[1:46:55] Father, of one mind, one accord. May you
[1:46:58] move, Lord. May miracles take place,
[1:47:00] Lord. Even on the wings of this prayer,
[1:47:03] Lord. I pray, Lord, for our brother
[1:47:05] Bruce Paris. Lord, wrote in for Sister
[1:47:07] Linda this evening, suffering with a
[1:47:10] headache. God, great physician, may you
[1:47:12] go to our sister just now, Lord, and may
[1:47:15] you relieve this headache. We pray,
[1:47:17] Lord, Oakley, Father, continue this,
[1:47:20] Lord. You love the animals there, Lord.
[1:47:22] You love what we love, Lord. And this is
[1:47:24] a dear animal to Chris and Katie.
[1:47:27] Father, I've watched you do it with our
[1:47:28] own animals. Lord, you're Lord. You're
[1:47:31] you're sufficient, Lord, in these kind
[1:47:33] of situations, Lord. I pray that you
[1:47:35] would move on the scene. Father, for
[1:47:37] every heart, Lord, that's unspoken
[1:47:39] tonight. Those that raised up their
[1:47:41] hands, Lord, to represent a need, I
[1:47:43] raise my hand up just now, Lord God,
[1:47:46] representing that need, Lord God, that
[1:47:48] you know is upon my heart. I pray,
[1:47:50] Father, that you would just move in a
[1:47:51] special way. Lord, may you sew the seed
[1:47:54] of the word which we heard tonight in
[1:47:56] our hearts. Lord, may it bring forth.
[1:47:58] Lord, we know your word won't return to
[1:48:00] you void, but your word says it will
[1:48:03] accomplish that which it was sent out to
[1:48:05] do. Now God, all of these needs that
[1:48:07] have been written down, have been
[1:48:09] spoken, Lord. We've we've announced
[1:48:11] them. We've brought them, Lord, before
[1:48:13] your throne. We're believing, Lord God,
[1:48:15] that you're going to do it, Father. It's
[1:48:17] something we can't do. All we can do is
[1:48:19] pray and ask, Lord, but you are the need
[1:48:22] meter. I pray, God, that you would move,
[1:48:24] Lord, in a special way on these needs,
[1:48:26] Lord. The ones that are written down,
[1:48:28] the ones that are unspoken.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; We ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:48:32] Christ.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:35] Pour your spirit out on me.
[1:48:40] Fall just like the rain.
[1:48:44] Lift it up now. Saturate
[1:48:48] my my thirsty soul.
[1:48:52] Come and fall aresh on me.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Oh yes Lord.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Fill my cup again.
[1:49:02] Heal my heart
[1:49:04] and make me whole.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; I need I need
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; I need you now.
