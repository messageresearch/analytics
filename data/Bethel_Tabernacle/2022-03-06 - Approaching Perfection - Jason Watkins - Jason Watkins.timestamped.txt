[29:13] looked beyond my faults and saw a seed
[29:17] hallelujah you can be seated god bless
[29:19] you for a moment
[29:22] amen just wanted to uh before we
[29:26] turned our scripture
[29:27] i just wanted to try to say something
[29:30] about
[29:31] last evening
[29:32] now i was thinking about this coming to
[29:34] church and i thought you know
[29:36] i really wouldn't know where to start
[29:40] which is a problem because
[29:42] then if i start i don't know where to
[29:44] stop
[29:45] and i'd end up taking all my
[29:48] ministry time to do it but i i realized
[29:50] that i would i would need all of my
[29:52] ministry time
[29:54] just to try to express to you
[29:56] what that meant to myself and my wife
[30:02] um i i truly have never been so
[30:04] surprised in my entire life and i spent
[30:06] a lot of time trying to think i try to
[30:08] think it's got to be a time that's equal
[30:09] to this and there has been no time
[30:12] in all my years
[30:14] that i have had an equal to that
[30:17] shock and surprise amen
[30:20] so i want to thank you i want to thank
[30:22] everybody who made that possible
[30:24] um you know it's
[30:28] you you want to say this person that
[30:29] person this person
[30:31] but really it's it's the whole family
[30:32] the whole bethel family
[30:35] and i i guess that's probably the
[30:37] greatest
[30:38] accomplishment
[30:40] um that if i i don't i don't feel like i
[30:43] have too many
[30:46] you know things that i can
[30:48] and just quietly sit and think wow i
[30:50] really got that right in 27 years of
[30:52] pastoring but one thing that
[30:54] the lord has allowed my wife and i to
[30:57] accomplish together and it took took us
[30:59] doing it together
[31:01] is we have fostered
[31:03] the whole feeling it's not just a
[31:05] thought cliche or a saying a motto
[31:08] it really is how we feel this is a
[31:10] family
[31:11] this whole church is a family
[31:14] amen and i
[31:16] i always wanted it that way i i remember
[31:19] even in the years when i thought i would
[31:21] never be a pastor and didn't want to
[31:23] ever be one but i thought if i ever was
[31:27] the last thing i would want
[31:30] i don't mean this to sound disparaging
[31:32] so just try to hear my heart when i say
[31:36] it i just always thought that if i ever
[31:39] was a pastor i i would not
[31:42] want to be a pastor of just a
[31:45] just another message church on the
[31:47] corner
[31:48] amen
[31:49] you know we we have plenty of that i
[31:51] thought you know i want it to be
[31:53] something that reflects
[31:55] my vision of a church and a family and
[31:58] camaraderie and all for one and one for
[32:01] all y'all ever heard me say that
[32:05] amen
[32:07] so
[32:08] it was really i mean it's this morning
[32:10] quite impossible
[32:12] to tell you how i feel about last night
[32:14] i know that it was also
[32:18] equally
[32:21] heartwarming to my family and to my
[32:23] mother to my children my grandchildren
[32:26] amen my grandchildren already think i'm
[32:28] the greatest human in the world but that
[32:30] really

[32:52] all unworthy all just bawled up into one

[33:00] of my
[33:02] self sister debbie and my entire family

[35:12] amen i think they're more concerned
[35:14] about the broadcast and i am too we like
[35:17] to make sure that that has a really good
[35:18] sound
[35:20] um so i'll just hey once i get going
[35:22] you'll wish i'd have moved it away
[35:24] amen so
[35:26] praise the lord
[35:29] um
[35:31] hebrews chapter 6 and we're just going
[35:34] to catch
[35:37] thanks
[35:39] hebrews chapter 6
[35:42] we're going to catch paul coming now to
[35:44] this subject
[35:46] of he's carrying on with this subject of
[35:49] melchizedek i should rather say
[35:51] and
[35:52] he picks up in the 17th verse
[35:56] and we'll read down through the end of
[35:58] of chapter 6 and we'll go a few into
[36:00] chapter 7. so chapter 6 verse 17
[36:08] wherein god willing more abundantly to
[36:11] show unto the heirs of promise
[36:14] the immutability of his counsel
[36:16] confirmed it by an oath
[36:20] that by two immutable things
[36:23] in which it was impossible for god to
[36:25] lie
[36:26] we might have a strong consolation
[36:29] so by two things first that he said it
[36:33] secondly that he can't lie
[36:35] all right
[36:36] right so it's uh it's a double
[36:37] confirmation
[36:39] um that we might have strong consolation
[36:43] who have fled for refuge to lay hold
[36:47] upon the hope set before us now i just
[36:49] want to say that that
[36:50] that's god looking out for you in this
[36:53] impossible age
[36:55] because when it comes to melchizedek his
[36:58] whole
[36:59] existence is most poignant most
[37:02] important most
[37:05] forward right now
[37:07] amen as brother branham talks about a
[37:09] greater than solomon is here
[37:12] actually paul is going to to begin to
[37:15] show that
[37:16] under the new covenant of christ that it
[37:18] really is
[37:20] it's greater than melchizedek because
[37:23] melchizedek is going to become jesus
[37:25] christ and if that wasn't going to be
[37:27] greater why become it
[37:30] you see so every time it's going forward
[37:32] it's going to be greater all right
[37:34] all right now let's carry on
[37:38] which
[37:39] hope verse 19 we have as an anchor of
[37:42] the soul
[37:43] both sure and steadfast and which
[37:46] entereth into that within the veil
[37:49] whether the forerunner is for us entered
[37:52] even jesus
[37:53] made an high priest forever after the
[37:55] order of melchizedek for this
[37:57] melchizedek king of salem priest of the
[38:00] most high god who met abraham returning
[38:03] from the slaughter of the kings blessed
[38:04] him
[38:05] to whom
[38:06] also abraham gave a tenth part of all
[38:09] first being by interpretation king of
[38:11] righteousness and after that also king
[38:14] of salem which is king of peace and that
[38:16] beautiful without father without mother
[38:19] without descent having neither beginning
[38:22] of days nor ending of life but made like
[38:25] unto the son of god abideth the priest
[38:28] continually
[38:30] now that's important
[38:32] because
[38:34] when you understand
[38:37] the application
[38:39] of melchizedek as it relates to you
[38:43] amen
[38:45] remember jesus melchizedek became jesus
[38:48] christ
[38:49] jesus christ became mrs jesus christ you
[38:52] follow me
[38:53] so as it relates to you and i
[38:56] it's extremely important that you
[38:58] realize you're in this verse without
[39:01] father without mother without beginning
[39:04] of days without ending of life
[39:06] amen that's the ministry and it fits you
[39:12] and only you
[39:13] because you began in the mind of god
[39:18] so you see the significance all right
[39:20] let's pray
[39:22] father we thank you
[39:24] for your word now we ask your blessing
[39:27] to be upon it we commit ourselves into
[39:30] your hands in jesus name
[39:33] amen god bless you friends you can be
[39:34] seated
[39:47] we would just like to make a quick note
[39:50] to you concerning the saints
[39:53] in ukraine we have been actively sending
[39:56] everything that comes in straight over
[39:58] we're using
[39:59] brother barry coffee's established
[40:01] pipeline there's no need to reinvent the
[40:03] wheel
[40:04] his is working
[40:06] and it's pretty much a miracle that it's
[40:08] working
[40:09] but it is and we've already received
[40:12] reports back from the believers that
[40:13] they're receiving what we're sending and
[40:16] what other churches are sending
[40:18] and uh it's it's their their gratitude
[40:21] is
[40:22] is thick and so i just wanted to pass
[40:24] that along to you we still have not a
[40:27] single report of any believer suffering
[40:29] casualties or even an injury

[40:37] pray for them
[40:38] and they're still um they're still
[40:41] holding services and they're still
[40:42] holding prayer meetings and even with
[40:44] shells falling amen so we thank the lord
[40:48] for his saving grace and his protection
[40:51] amen praise the lord

[42:38] she'd be the child of a of a niece of
[42:40] mine and they had to take her to the
[42:42] hospital up in north carolina with rsv
[42:44] rsv or whatever they call that
[42:47] respiratory problems
[42:48] and so we're praying for that as well
[42:51] amen now
[42:53] let me get straight into
[42:55] my sermon today and i wish to
[42:58] take a title called approaching
[43:01] perfection and
[43:03] maybe if they can give me my power
[43:06] powerpoint brother caleb thank you
[43:08] kindly and i guess i'm going to fire it
[43:10] from here amen let's see if i'm um
[43:14] uh working here yep perfect so we're
[43:17] gonna get into that all right we'll
[43:18] leave it there for just a moment
[43:20] approaching perfection and we're dealing
[43:23] with the subtitle the final days of the
[43:27] omega bride is that you
[43:29] now
[43:31] it's interesting here in our text
[43:33] reading
[43:34] because we we find out that paul
[43:37] had
[43:38] previously right in the fifth chapter of
[43:41] hebrews before coming to what we read in
[43:44] our text this morning he actually goes
[43:47] and begins to try to condition their
[43:49] mind uh he's gonna take that whole fifth
[43:52] chapter and show them how that god was
[43:54] you know how that god himself was
[43:56] willing to lower himself uh down to
[44:00] become a temptable man uh so that he
[44:03] could feel what we feel so that he would
[44:06] be a faithful high priest to know your
[44:08] struggles
[44:09] so you don't have to explain
[44:12] what it's like to be you know a human
[44:15] under the temptation of the enemy and
[44:17] under the trials and tribulations of
[44:19] life and under stress and tiredness and
[44:21] sickness and anxiety
[44:22] jesus knows firsthand what that feels
[44:26] like
[44:26] and so paul is trying to get the church
[44:29] in that fifth chapter to understand that
[44:31] you know if there if there ever was a
[44:33] reason to not lose hope or to not give
[44:36] up that that that's the reason that we
[44:39] have a faithful high priest
[44:41] and so don't don't let yourself be
[44:44] discouraged the bible even says that you
[44:46] know if things get really too thick and
[44:48] too hot and hard and heavy you start to
[44:51] feel down you start to feel like life's
[44:53] unfair the apostles said look just
[44:55] consider jesus
[44:57] who suffered such a contradiction
[44:59] against of sinners against himself he
[45:02] was innocent
[45:03] and we were guilty and yet god swapped
[45:07] you swapped him for you
[45:10] that's that blows my mind
[45:12] that god traded the innocent for the
[45:15] guilty see
[45:17] and so so he is here we realize that you
[45:21] know he knows what i'm going through and
[45:23] this was paul's great burden that the
[45:25] hebrew nation understand that he knows
[45:28] what we're going through that he
[45:30] understands you want to know today
[45:32] and i can say for me and i can say it's
[45:35] true for you he understands my
[45:37] frustrations
[45:39] he understands your frustrations
[45:43] at least half of which we bring on
[45:45] ourself
[45:47] amen
[45:48] he understands i want you to know that
[45:50] he knows
[45:52] what we are going through
[45:54] and he's here to help he's here to help
[45:57] me
[45:58] he's here to help you he's not here to
[46:02] destroy us
[46:03] as satan would have us believe sometimes
[46:06] preaching can get pretty rough sometimes
[46:08] it can get what brother branham would
[46:09] call gun barrel straight and you know it
[46:12] can seem at times
[46:14] you know where it's it's really coming
[46:16] down hard but
[46:18] just always remember
[46:20] he's not here to destroy you that's what
[46:23] satan would have you believe
[46:26] satan does that to get you to feel like
[46:29] giving up yes amen
[46:32] i'm here to tell you friends we live in
[46:33] a real world and you're a real person
[46:36] and there's no sense coming here and
[46:38] painting ourselves as if we're the
[46:40] perfect people who never have a problem
[46:43] who never make a stumble nonsense
[46:46] we just throw that stuff out we're all
[46:48] just we're all just we're all just a
[46:50] bunch of no goods who god loved
[46:53] amen and somehow even while i was a
[46:57] sinner he loved me
[46:59] amen and so i i just throw that back in
[47:02] the face of the enemy
[47:04] when he tries to remind me of my
[47:07] failures i just remind him that god
[47:09] already knew
[47:11] my failures that i would make before i
[47:14] made them before i was born before
[47:16] before anything god already knew and
[47:19] christ died for me
[47:22] anyway so
[47:24] now brother branham begins to talk about
[47:27] this uh priesthood this this melchizedek
[47:32] um and he's going to deal with the
[47:34] claims that some say this some say is
[47:36] merely a priesthood some say he wasn't a
[47:38] real man it's hard to believe but people
[47:41] can actually believe that he he just uh
[47:43] i i heard our biggest our biggest mega
[47:46] church in this town and that doctor of
[47:48] divinity with more letters behind his
[47:51] name than some of our names
[47:53] and he said no he was just a normal man
[47:56] lived and died i'm like why do you not
[47:58] believe the bible i mean when i read the
[48:00] bible don't come telling me he was a
[48:02] normal man who lived and died i'm
[48:04] reading in a bible that he had no
[48:05] beginning of days
[48:07] nor ending of life and abideth
[48:08] continually
[48:10] see
[48:11] so
[48:12] brother branham goes on here and who is
[48:14] this melchizedek
[48:15] one of the schools are claims he's just
[48:18] a myth he wasn't actually a person and
[48:20] others say
[48:21] it was a priesthood that was the
[48:24] mount that was the melchizedek
[48:26] priesthood that's the most likely one
[48:28] they hold better to that side than they
[48:30] do the other is because they say it was
[48:34] a priesthood
[48:36] it can't be that
[48:38] for in the fourth verse it says he was a
[48:41] person
[48:43] a man so in order to be a person he has
[48:47] to be a personality a man not an order
[48:50] but a person
[48:51] so he was not just a priesthood order
[48:54] see
[48:55] so he was not just a priesthood order
[48:58] neither was he a myth he was a person
[49:02] you're getting it all right you're
[49:03] following now watch
[49:04] and the eternal and the person is
[49:07] eternal if you notice he had no father
[49:09] he had no mother he had no time he ever
[49:11] began he had no time he ever ended and
[49:13] whoever it was is still alive tonight
[49:16] because the bible said here that he had
[49:19] neither father or mother beginning of
[49:21] days or ending of life so it would have
[49:23] to be an eternal person is that right an
[49:26] eternal person so it could only be one
[49:29] person that's god because he's the only
[49:32] one that's eternal all right you agree
[49:34] with that i'm sure you agree with that
[49:36] see all right now
[49:38] and now the thing that i contend is that
[49:41] he was god because he's the only person
[49:44] that can be immortal and now god
[49:46] changing himself
[49:48] into a person and that's what he was no
[49:52] father no mother no beginning of life no
[49:55] ending of days
[49:58] the whole bible
[50:00] is the revelation of god
[50:03] the whole church is built upon the
[50:06] revelation of god there's no other way
[50:09] to know god only by revelation to whom
[50:12] the son will reveal him revelation
[50:16] everything is revelation so to not
[50:19] accept the revelation then you're just a
[50:22] cold theologian and there is no hope for
[50:25] you
[50:28] now
[50:29] could there be anything
[50:31] sadder than that
[50:33] you know it's one thing
[50:34] if you were tomorrow to have a doctor
[50:37] say to you you have a terminal illness
[50:40] and i'm sorry to say there's no hope for
[50:43] you
[50:44] that would be bad enough but to actually
[50:47] have a prophet tell you that there is no
[50:50] hope for you now you have to understand
[50:52] if you go to listen to the tape brother
[50:54] branham is relating a story about a he
[50:56] was in a in a conversation with a man
[50:59] who's a minister
[51:00] and you know he was arguing with brother
[51:02] branham and said you know it's
[51:03] revelation and the man said i can't
[51:05] receive revelation
[51:06] i got to be able to read it exactly in
[51:09] the text and i can't i can't
[51:12] rely on revelation and brother branham
[51:14] says well then you cut yourself off from
[51:16] god
[51:17] see because if you can only read what's
[51:20] on the line but you have no revelation
[51:23] for what's between the line then you're
[51:25] just a cold theologian
[51:27] all you've got is head knowledge see
[51:30] and so so we realize that brother
[51:32] branham if you listen to him on the tape
[51:35] he's not reveling in that it and we
[51:37] should not revel in that it was a sad
[51:40] resignation in his heart as he's telling
[51:42] the story so because he's trying to help
[51:45] the man who he was speaking to
[51:47] nonetheless this is true both in a
[51:51] principle and application because
[51:53] because when you refuse you know you
[51:56] because if you find yourself where you
[51:59] become satisfied
[52:02] to just merely be filled with knowledge
[52:05] but but you never
[52:07] come to a real
[52:09] changing power
[52:11] in your life that's a sad state
[52:14] see
[52:15] and this is this is what a cold
[52:17] theologian is you you've memorized a lot
[52:20] of bible you know it by heart you can
[52:22] quote it forwards and backwards you
[52:23] understand great mysteries
[52:26] but you've never really
[52:28] felt what it feels like to have the
[52:30] power of god come into your heart and
[52:33] change your whole nature away from the
[52:36] world and turn you toward god's
[52:38] righteousness see
[52:40] and this happens because refusing to
[52:42] allow
[52:44] the spirit to reveal himself further to
[52:46] you
[52:47] you you you never become different you
[52:50] only generally become more religious
[52:53] you start going to a church
[52:55] you you know you stop lying you start
[52:58] going to church you
[53:00] you know little things like that that's
[53:02] all good that's all fine you need to
[53:04] stop lying you need to stop stealing let
[53:06] him that stealeth steal no more says the
[53:08] bible and so you know you need to follow
[53:12] the dictates of of holiness but as as
[53:16] old mace jackson used to say sitting in
[53:18] a church won't make you a christian any
[53:21] more than sitting in a a garage would
[53:23] make you an automobile
[53:27] oh brother mays and and and so we find
[53:30] then that that what that what happens
[53:33] the end result is that you can go many
[53:36] many years
[53:38] accumulating doctrinal knowledge
[53:41] but yet you you're never really able to
[53:44] see
[53:45] you're never really able to see your
[53:47] life threaded into the life of god you
[53:50] know there's not that blending and you
[53:52] know it's not there you know what you
[53:55] know what you believe mentally but you
[53:57] but you when you close your eyes at
[53:59] night you know
[54:00] that somehow it's not stitched into the
[54:03] fabric of of your psyche of who you are
[54:06] it's not really having an impact or a
[54:08] directional uh efficacy on your personal
[54:12] life
[54:13] it's not really ever changed your
[54:14] desires
[54:16] you don't want to go to hell of course
[54:17] you don't
[54:18] who does you don't want to miss a
[54:20] rapture nobody who hears about it would
[54:22] want to miss it but but it's got to go
[54:26] further than that and this is what the
[54:28] ministry of melchizedek is here to
[54:31] accomplish because that was god living
[54:34] in a mortal man
[54:36] and so we realized then that he later
[54:40] brother branham says he he's alive today
[54:42] he said whoever he was he's alive
[54:44] tonight and yet brother branham would
[54:46] say
[54:46] that we don't hear no more about him
[54:51] because he became something different
[54:53] say well wait a minute i thought he's
[54:54] still alive tonight he is
[54:56] but he he in morphed himself and became
[54:59] jesus christ god as brother ram said
[55:01] jesus christ god changing himself into a
[55:04] person see so now then you realize that
[55:07] was he done there no that was not the
[55:09] end of god's plan
[55:11] that's not what melchizedek was showing
[55:14] oh my
[55:15] melchizedek was showing that there's
[55:16] going to be a whole kingdom of people
[55:19] who are the word living as a human being
[55:22] that the word is now made flesh in their
[55:25] lives and that's that's why he abideth
[55:28] forever he's he'll he never has a
[55:30] beginning of days he never has an ending
[55:32] of life he just kept changing stations
[55:35] kept changing manifestations he was in
[55:37] the nazarene who walked the shores of
[55:39] galilee but god was never planning
[55:43] to stay bottled up in one human walking
[55:45] the shores of galilee
[55:47] jesus even said except the corn of wheat
[55:49] died abideth alone and the whole plan of
[55:52] redemption was so he wouldn't abide
[55:53] alone that's the reason the whole thing
[55:56] started he didn't want to abide alone he
[55:58] wanted to be a family
[56:02] and this now
[56:04] this brings the order of melchizedek
[56:06] upon your life when you're born again of
[56:08] the spirit of god
[56:11] see
[56:13] so you know it's
[56:15] it's it's it's your life you realize
[56:18] that your life we talk about
[56:20] an unfolding mystery of god in our day
[56:24] but i i i'm going to show you paul's
[56:28] words in the book of ephesians
[56:30] and i'm going to give you a clue what
[56:31] you're looking for all right
[56:33] because i'm i'm not here to tell you
[56:37] neither was paul
[56:39] merely interested
[56:41] in in this unfolding mystery of god just
[56:45] be data to you
[56:47] amen
[56:48] right
[56:49] because he's actually going to show you
[56:52] that this mystery
[56:54] wants fellowship with you
[56:57] so it's not data
[56:59] it's not just knowledge it's a person
[57:02] and he's unfolding himself and that's
[57:04] why the world is unaware of who he is
[57:07] and what it takes to please him because
[57:09] they don't even realize he's living in a
[57:11] body in the earth right now
[57:15] see so paul desired you to become a part
[57:18] of the mystery watch
[57:21] ephesians 3 very wonderful
[57:24] ephesians is not really um
[57:26] a book paul's not really
[57:29] teaching a lot of doctrine it's it's a
[57:31] really a book to encourage the church
[57:33] here at ephesus to really show them who
[57:35] they're who they are in their position
[57:37] that is in christ a little bit different
[57:39] from the book of corinthians in that
[57:40] regard
[57:41] paul says how that by revelation he made
[57:44] he made known unto me the mystery as i
[57:46] wrote a four and a few in a few words
[57:49] whereby when you read you may understand
[57:51] my knowledge in the mystery of christ
[57:53] what's this all about paul what's this
[57:55] mystery of mystery of christ what are
[57:56] you talking about which in other ages so
[57:59] it's something
[58:00] that in other ages was not made known so
[58:02] it's a something to be made known
[58:05] and in other ages it was not made known
[58:07] unto the sons of men as it is now
[58:09] revealed unto his holy apostles and
[58:11] prophets by the spirit see by revelation
[58:13] of the spirit what is it can you can you
[58:16] give us a clue here it is
[58:18] that the gentiles should be fellow heirs
[58:20] and of the same body and partakers of
[58:23] his promise in christ by the gospel the
[58:25] jews never imagined that happening
[58:27] whereof i was made a minister according
[58:30] to the gift of great the the grace of
[58:32] god given unto me by the effectual
[58:35] working of his power unto me
[58:37] who am less than the least of all saints
[58:40] is this grace given that i should preach
[58:42] among the gentiles the unsearchable
[58:46] riches of christ
[58:49] and to make all men see
[58:52] what is the fellowship of the mystery
[58:56] which from the beginning of the world
[58:58] hath been hid in god who created all
[59:01] things by jesus christ to the intent for
[59:04] the purpose that now
[59:06] unto the principalities and powers in
[59:08] heavenly places might be known
[59:10] by the church the manifold wisdom of god
[59:13] watch now all right let me let me stop
[59:16] right there before i go to that quote
[59:17] now
[59:18] the manifold wisdom of god if paul would
[59:21] go on to say
[59:23] that what is this great mystery it's
[59:25] christ
[59:27] in you
[59:29] that's the hope that's the purpose
[59:31] that's the reason that's what
[59:33] melchizedek is showing and that's why
[59:35] brother branham
[59:37] that's that's why when when nicodemus
[59:39] comes to jesus at night and he says now
[59:43] we know
[59:45] you have to be of god the counsel knows
[59:48] because
[59:49] no one can do
[59:50] what you're doing
[59:52] except he be of god because you see they
[59:56] had not seen
[59:58] that level of the word made flesh since
[1:00:01] the days of abraham when he met
[1:00:02] melchizedek and the king of salem who
[1:00:05] was the priest of the most high god when
[1:00:07] abraham met him and they and they and
[1:00:09] their and he discerned the thoughts in
[1:00:13] in the in the heart of sarah behind him
[1:00:16] now it's not to say
[1:00:17] prophets hadn't come that discerned
[1:00:19] people's thinking that's not what it's
[1:00:21] just saying it's not saying you know
[1:00:23] there's this miracle of discernment but
[1:00:25] what it's saying is we've never seen
[1:00:28] that combined in such a way
[1:00:30] that literally the promise of god is
[1:00:34] living behind human skin
[1:00:36] and we we know that you have to be
[1:00:38] because
[1:00:39] this is exactly what our father abraham
[1:00:42] saw and your your evidence that that was
[1:00:45] true and you must be true well i'm here
[1:00:47] to tell you something today that's why
[1:00:49] brother branham would constantly go and
[1:00:51] pull that forward and he'd come to saint
[1:00:53] john 4 every time in a prayer line here
[1:00:56] a man and a woman and he starts
[1:00:57] discerning her heart what is he doing
[1:00:59] what's happening what is brother branham
[1:01:01] trying to get the people to understand
[1:01:03] in this hour that the purpose of what we
[1:01:06] see in melchizedek which was seen in
[1:01:08] jesus christ must be seen in within us
[1:01:12] you must see god in you you must see it
[1:01:16] amen
[1:01:18] you must see that you must see that
[1:01:20] prophecy cannot fail see now watch now
[1:01:24] i'm going to go on with brother branham
[1:01:25] all right watch
[1:01:28] and that's what god did
[1:01:31] it's the same god all the time
[1:01:34] god in the form of the father the spirit
[1:01:36] the pillar of fire see
[1:01:39] the same god was made flesh and blood
[1:01:41] among us in morphe brought out so he
[1:01:43] could be seen
[1:01:44] and now that same god
[1:01:46] is the holy ghost and that simple
[1:01:49] he moves on notice like the sculpture he
[1:01:51] hides with a mask over it that's what
[1:01:53] god has done to this age it's been hid
[1:01:55] all these things has been hid and it's
[1:01:58] supposed to be revealed
[1:02:00] in this age now the bible says
[1:02:03] they will be revealed in the latter
[1:02:05] times it's like a sculptor keeping his
[1:02:07] piece of work all covered over until the
[1:02:11] time he takes the mask
[1:02:13] off of it and
[1:02:15] off of it and there it is all right
[1:02:18] now that's what the bible has been
[1:02:23] it's been a work of god that's been
[1:02:26] covered up
[1:02:27] and it's been hid since the foundation
[1:02:29] of the world and its seven-fold mystery
[1:02:32] and god promised
[1:02:34] i'll tell you something friends
[1:02:36] you don't get this in the average
[1:02:38] american pulpit on a sunday morning
[1:02:41] this is this is almost completely
[1:02:44] unintelligible to them they're like huh
[1:02:46] what
[1:02:47] wait what but to us we read this and we
[1:02:50] realize our portion in it because we've
[1:02:51] been taught these things and we realize
[1:02:53] my goodness i am actually part of the of
[1:02:56] god's godhead i'm actually part of the
[1:02:58] family of god i'm actually here and my
[1:03:00] whole life has a purpose behind it i'm
[1:03:02] not just here
[1:03:03] i'm not just trying to be a better human
[1:03:05] i've actually got a greater i've got a
[1:03:07] greater heritage than that see that's
[1:03:10] what the devil don't want you to know
[1:03:13] see but knowing this is what helps you
[1:03:15] to persevere and to keep pressing and
[1:03:18] i'll press today and i'll press tomorrow
[1:03:20] and i'll press the next day and nothing
[1:03:22] is going to stop me from pressing
[1:03:24] because i understand this
[1:03:27] that's where your strength lies see
[1:03:30] it's been a work of god it's been
[1:03:31] covered up all right what a glorious
[1:03:34] he would uh and and god promised in the
[1:03:38] last day at the age of the laodicean
[1:03:40] church he would
[1:03:41] oh i was thinking like it said let me
[1:03:43] see here and god prophesy
[1:03:45] at the age of this latest in church he
[1:03:46] would take the mask off the whole thing
[1:03:49] and we could see it
[1:03:51] what a glorious thing all right last one
[1:03:54] here now
[1:03:55] god
[1:03:56] in morphe
[1:03:58] ma
[1:03:59] masked in the pillar of fire
[1:04:02] brother brown said like a stage actor
[1:04:03] he's got the same actor who goes
[1:04:05] backstage and changes his outfit he
[1:04:06] comes out as a different character but
[1:04:08] it's the same person see
[1:04:10] god in more faith and a man
[1:04:13] called jesus you believe that
[1:04:16] you believe that god in morphe was in a
[1:04:18] man called jesus
[1:04:20] does that give you hope and courage
[1:04:22] does that give you power over the devil
[1:04:24] when you say in the name of jesus
[1:04:26] because you know what you're talking
[1:04:27] about all right read on and what god in
[1:04:31] morphe in a man called jesus god in
[1:04:34] morphe in his church
[1:04:36] god above us god with us god in us what
[1:04:39] is it it's the condescending of god
[1:04:44] that's what we're a part of here today
[1:04:47] that's why this is not just a social
[1:04:49] gospel that's why this is not just
[1:04:51] legalism do's and don'ts you can't join
[1:04:54] this church it's a body you have to be
[1:04:56] born into it
[1:04:58] see
[1:05:00] and then there's power within that
[1:05:02] family see
[1:05:04] so now we realize that he's
[1:05:07] he's living
[1:05:08] in his body
[1:05:10] uh in the earth
[1:05:12] is this one the one that yeah perfect
[1:05:14] so he's living in his body
[1:05:18] in the earth friends
[1:05:19] the the exact same god just in a
[1:05:22] different form
[1:05:24] and in a different position
[1:05:27] because while the bride while christ
[1:05:30] means the anointed word so that's in
[1:05:32] that way brother branham would say so
[1:05:34] jeremiah was christ this is why jesus
[1:05:36] was christ and this is why christ exists
[1:05:39] in the body the bride is the word made
[1:05:41] flesh again in the earth see what's the
[1:05:43] difference between me as christ and him
[1:05:46] as christ he's both lord and christ so
[1:05:49] it's it's it's just it's just a
[1:05:51] different form of the same god with a
[1:05:54] different position paul
[1:05:56] could see it all clearly
[1:05:58] and he he so desired to impart that to
[1:06:02] the church but the church in paul's day
[1:06:05] became relaxed and dull of hearing and
[1:06:07] that's what paul goes on in that fifth
[1:06:09] chapter to say now i i really got a lot
[1:06:13] to say to you
[1:06:15] about melchizedek
[1:06:17] but but
[1:06:18] it's hard to s it's hard to say
[1:06:21] because you're dull of hearing see
[1:06:25] it's it's difficult on me i thought i
[1:06:27] had that verse um
[1:06:29] [Music]
[1:06:31] i thought i did thought i did thought i
[1:06:32] did um yes of whom we have hebrews 5 11
[1:06:37] of whom we have many things to say and
[1:06:39] hard to be uttered
[1:06:42] seeing ye are dull of hearing i get that
[1:06:44] as a preacher
[1:06:45] you know when you're when you just feel
[1:06:47] like you're just it's just going over
[1:06:48] everybody's head and and when you feel
[1:06:50] like when you when you're trying to
[1:06:52] preach the power of the kingdom of god
[1:06:54] and everybody's just starting to
[1:06:56] backslide and live carnal and this is
[1:06:57] what paul was facing the church was
[1:06:59] relaxing
[1:07:01] unbelievers and make believers were
[1:07:02] infiltrating the congregations
[1:07:04] i mean there i go i know that brother
[1:07:06] branham said you know every group has
[1:07:08] three kinds of believers in it but even
[1:07:10] that statement has to be qualified
[1:07:12] because there certainly weren't three
[1:07:13] kinds of believers in the upper room
[1:07:15] when 120 got the holy ghost
[1:07:17] all 120 of them were solid believers and
[1:07:19] 120 of them got born again
[1:07:21] now a little while later you see ananias
[1:07:23] and sapphira coming in mingling in you
[1:07:26] know like i said to you before and
[1:07:28] today it's it's hard on us because
[1:07:30] churches are everywhere and
[1:07:32] denominations are in the thousands
[1:07:34] there's more than 30 000 different
[1:07:36] denominations and independent movements
[1:07:38] that actually have a charter but but in
[1:07:41] but in the days of the apostle paul
[1:07:43] every church was a message church there
[1:07:45] was only one gospel
[1:07:47] one lord one faith amen one baptism one
[1:07:50] god father above all who is it all amen
[1:07:53] so so we realize that that the church
[1:07:56] began to slip away and paul could see
[1:07:58] all of this clearly in melchizedek but
[1:08:01] as the church began to slip away
[1:08:03] that that that they were never able paul
[1:08:07] kept talking about this vision how that
[1:08:09] he's he's trying to get that church
[1:08:11] there that alpha church to say now
[1:08:12] listen this is all going to culminate in
[1:08:15] a body change you know we that the dead
[1:08:19] in christ shall rise everybody's like
[1:08:20] really when soon and we which are alive
[1:08:23] and remain shall be caught up we'll be
[1:08:26] changed how fast in a moment in the
[1:08:27] twinkling of an eye and we'll ever be
[1:08:30] with the lord now it just sounds like oh
[1:08:32] my he's just going to be here next week
[1:08:34] but that church started to slip away
[1:08:36] that church started to backslide and and
[1:08:39] and they failed to keep going but i'm
[1:08:43] here to tell you that this message this
[1:08:45] is precisely what has been brought back
[1:08:48] to us everything paul was trying to get
[1:08:51] them to come to
[1:08:53] and you the omega bride have been called
[1:08:55] back to this glorious truth to do what
[1:08:58] to fulfill that word a body change
[1:09:03] it must be
[1:09:05] it has to be see
[1:09:07] no matter it doesn't matter what your
[1:09:09] eyes see
[1:09:10] about you
[1:09:13] your eyes
[1:09:15] your eyes can look sometimes people's
[1:09:17] let their eyes look at their neighbor
[1:09:18] and go he's never going to make it
[1:09:23] and what you
[1:09:24] are too prideful to admit i heard
[1:09:26] brother jd talk about pride this morning
[1:09:28] what you're too prideful is me to admit
[1:09:30] is you lay in your bed at night and
[1:09:31] think you're not either
[1:09:34] i've always said show me an overly
[1:09:35] suspicious person i'll show you a
[1:09:37] dishonest one
[1:09:38] because they expect everybody to be like
[1:09:39] them
[1:09:41] see
[1:09:41] and oh everybody must be liars that's
[1:09:43] because you're one and you think
[1:09:44] everybody else is see
[1:09:46] and i you can't believe how many times
[1:09:48] i've seen people get so mad lose their
[1:09:51] cool lose their temper get irritated
[1:09:53] grieve the holy spirit and and the whole
[1:09:56] thing that they try to pass it off onto
[1:09:57] is righteous indignation because they
[1:09:59] see oh that sister her skirt or that
[1:10:01] young man or that married couple or this
[1:10:03] person and really really
[1:10:06] too often times i'm sad to say i found
[1:10:09] that it's really because the person
[1:10:10] wanted to do it themselves but they were
[1:10:11] too afraid to go to hell so they
[1:10:13] wouldn't do it themselves but they
[1:10:14] craved it and they were jealous that
[1:10:15] that person could do it and they wanted
[1:10:17] to do it but they didn't want to be seen
[1:10:18] doing it
[1:10:20] oh come on friends
[1:10:22] oh we're all just a bunch of no goods
[1:10:24] we're here by the grace of god
[1:10:28] oh my
[1:10:30] and so i'm here to tell you that this
[1:10:32] prophecy will come to pass it doesn't
[1:10:35] matter what you see
[1:10:36] even within yourself listen abraham
[1:10:39] didn't see a whole lot
[1:10:41] when melchizedek comes and makes the
[1:10:43] promise to him he didn't see a whole lot
[1:10:45] he had to go 25 years going in the
[1:10:48] opposite direction aging out getting
[1:10:50] older getting further away from
[1:10:52] possibilities sarah the same way i mean
[1:10:55] she couldn't even have children when she
[1:10:57] was a young woman
[1:10:59] and now she's only getting further from
[1:11:01] it how's it and abraham just knew it's
[1:11:03] going to be a greater miracle you know
[1:11:05] and and so he didn't see a sign of it
[1:11:08] but his change was underway
[1:11:10] her change was underway there wasn't one
[1:11:12] sign they could look at but it was
[1:11:14] happening
[1:11:16] i don't always see it i don't know how
[1:11:18] i'm gonna make it i just have to say
[1:11:19] like john what love is this i don't even
[1:11:22] know what i am but here's what i know
[1:11:24] when he appears i will be like him
[1:11:26] because i'm believing his word and his
[1:11:28] word is changing me
[1:11:31] hallelujah
[1:11:32] the trumpet will sound and we will be
[1:11:35] changed
[1:11:37] and what seems obscure to us will be
[1:11:39] made plain as the bible says we shall
[1:11:41] know as we are known amen
[1:11:45] we'll go from what brother branham used
[1:11:47] he
[1:11:48] put two terms together and called it
[1:11:50] partial realization
[1:11:51] you know as opposed to perfect
[1:11:53] realization which was
[1:11:55] really just the uh all it does is
[1:11:57] express his perfect realization as an
[1:11:59] idea
[1:12:00] as contrasted with partial realization
[1:12:02] so
[1:12:03] so in in john jesus said in john uh 6 i
[1:12:07] don't think i have any of this
[1:12:10] no i didn't but let me just quote it to
[1:12:12] you he said in in john 6 32 moses gave
[1:12:16] you not that bread from heaven but my
[1:12:19] father giveth you the true bread from
[1:12:20] heaven so moses was saying
[1:12:23] that or jesus was saying that bread
[1:12:26] i'm not saying moses didn't give you a
[1:12:28] bread
[1:12:29] i'm not even saying it didn't come down
[1:12:31] his angels food from heaven
[1:12:33] what he under jesus was saying what i'm
[1:12:35] trying to get you to understand is that
[1:12:37] was only a partial type
[1:12:39] of what i am in perfection
[1:12:41] you see
[1:12:42] hebrews 9 24 for christ is not entered
[1:12:45] into the holy places made with hands
[1:12:48] which are the figures of the true
[1:12:50] but into heaven itself not to appear in
[1:12:52] the presence of god so moses built a
[1:12:55] tabernacle in the wilderness solomon
[1:12:57] built a temple for him but that was only
[1:12:59] partial realization even though the
[1:13:01] spirit of god came down and lived in it
[1:13:03] and spoke to him from the tabernacle of
[1:13:04] the congregation and the shekinah was
[1:13:06] there for real
[1:13:09] and i mean it blessed people
[1:13:11] and people who defied it and killed them
[1:13:13] and and it caused a rod to bud that was
[1:13:16] just an old dry stick so it was for real
[1:13:18] it wasn't just a metaphor that temple
[1:13:20] that tabernacle was real but it was
[1:13:23] partial compared to jesus when he came
[1:13:26] he was the perfect realization of all of
[1:13:29] that you see
[1:13:31] so even in first corinthians these are
[1:13:33] examples brother branham uses for now we
[1:13:36] see through a glass darkly paul says in
[1:13:38] first corinthians 13
[1:13:40] but then
[1:13:41] face to face
[1:13:43] now i know in part but then shall i know
[1:13:46] even as also i am known
[1:13:49] and so so what we find then is brother
[1:13:52] branham tells us in the church in the
[1:13:54] church age book he says partial
[1:13:56] realization
[1:13:58] will be made perfect realizations making
[1:14:00] sure i didn't have that on the slides he
[1:14:03] says
[1:14:05] partial realization will be made perfect
[1:14:07] realization in other words completed
[1:14:10] realization hallelujah
[1:14:12] we we have been
[1:14:14] looking through a glass darkly but soon
[1:14:18] it will be face to face a prophet
[1:14:19] picking up first corinthians 13 12 and
[1:14:22] saying that's a scripture for this hour
[1:14:25] that we have been looking at the church
[1:14:28] in a partial realization we've seen the
[1:14:31] holy spirit come into the church we've
[1:14:33] seen the power to heal the sick and
[1:14:35] raise the dead we've seen the power to
[1:14:37] discern the unbelievers we've seen all
[1:14:39] of that but there's coming an hour where
[1:14:41] it's not just something that will be a
[1:14:43] partial thing that we see occasionally
[1:14:46] what it's going to become is an every
[1:14:48] moment reality when a bride stands in a
[1:14:50] perfect body with the perfect word in
[1:14:52] her mouth
[1:14:56] this is exactly the vitamins and
[1:14:59] nutrients of the word that god is trying
[1:15:01] to get to you that satan is trying every
[1:15:04] way he can to distract you from
[1:15:07] see
[1:15:09] so he says
[1:15:11] we have been going forward we we have
[1:15:14] been going from glory to glory
[1:15:17] but soon
[1:15:18] it will be right in the glory
[1:15:21] and in his glory will shine
[1:15:24] we shall be like him
[1:15:26] wondrously
[1:15:28] like him
[1:15:29] here's a beautiful promise
[1:15:31] one day
[1:15:32] we will be changed in the atoms
[1:15:36] we will put on immortality
[1:15:39] you believe that we'll be swallowed up
[1:15:42] in life
[1:15:44] see this is what happened
[1:15:45] in the days of john coming as john the
[1:15:47] baptist is coming as elijah
[1:15:50] and the bible said that
[1:15:52] that
[1:15:53] the bible talks about this prophecy of
[1:15:55] christ coming i believe in hosea uh that
[1:15:58] might stand correction i think it is but
[1:16:00] he says
[1:16:01] the one you're looking for
[1:16:03] will suddenly come to his temple
[1:16:06] and i mean you know here's all these
[1:16:08] believers following john and they're
[1:16:09] just going to church
[1:16:11] oh it's church john john's preaching at
[1:16:12] the river today come on honey get up get

[1:16:22] the river and hear him every day

[1:16:50] bought we rolled up to the river got out
[1:16:52] walked up and stood in the crowd and
[1:16:54] john took a different text
[1:16:56] there wasn't no words going on with our
[1:16:58] pastor and he said the one i've been
[1:16:59] telling you about is standing among you
[1:17:01] right now
[1:17:02] i'm like wait wait what what is he even
[1:17:04] saying and it wasn't even very long he
[1:17:06] goes there he is
[1:17:08] there he is the one who you expect will
[1:17:11] suddenly come to his temple i'm here to
[1:17:13] tell you it'll be just like that friends
[1:17:15] one of these mornings are going to come
[1:17:16] on a sunday morning and i'm going to say
[1:17:18] there he is he's here we're going home
[1:17:23] hallelujah
[1:17:26] oh my he will suddenly appear
[1:17:29] see
[1:17:31] that's that's exactly when you go back
[1:17:32] to abraham i mean once that ministry of
[1:17:35] melchizedek came on the scene the change
[1:17:37] came on quickly see
[1:17:39] it was just it's really just a
[1:17:42] one more year i think after that he said
[1:17:44] this time next year about the time of
[1:17:46] life
[1:17:46] she's gonna conceive
[1:17:48] and and you know something that
[1:17:50] deliverance you're talking about
[1:17:52] shall suddenly appear
[1:17:54] she
[1:17:55] overnight the change came overnight
[1:17:59] there was hardly one sign of anything
[1:18:02] all they had was their faith
[1:18:04] and all abraham and sarah could do every
[1:18:07] time they went to church was claim the
[1:18:08] promise
[1:18:10] all they could do is keep claiming the
[1:18:12] promise and keep claiming the promise
[1:18:14] and they had bills to pay and they had
[1:18:16] you know
[1:18:17] servants and a headquarters and a home
[1:18:19] and and and and here he had he had one
[1:18:22] child and and he's and he's got all
[1:18:24] these complications everybody's got a
[1:18:25] promise
[1:18:26] just like you and i we got families and
[1:18:28] we got jobs and we got careers and we
[1:18:30] got church and we got this and that and
[1:18:32] we buy groceries and go out to eat but
[1:18:34] i'm here to tell you that that change
[1:18:36] came overnight
[1:18:38] they went to bed old and woke up young
[1:18:41] no wonder a prophet said it'll come like
[1:18:43] between six and nine in the morning oh
[1:18:46] let it be right away oh god i'll go to
[1:18:49] bed hurting and achy and tired wake up
[1:18:51] new
[1:18:53] hallelujah
[1:18:54] oh my we're in the days of abraham all
[1:18:57] over again
[1:18:58] see
[1:19:01] in his presence friends
[1:19:05] that's when we see ourselves as he does
[1:19:09] that's the secret
[1:19:12] of
[1:19:13] surviving
[1:19:14] in this discouraging tiring
[1:19:17] draining day
[1:19:20] is to steal away into his presence
[1:19:23] because it was in his presence
[1:19:26] that's when god
[1:19:27] added deity to his name to his wife's
[1:19:30] name added an h
[1:19:31] and he goes from abram to abraham she
[1:19:34] goes from sarai to sarah and god adds an
[1:19:36] h because an h in the old testament
[1:19:38] stands for deity
[1:19:39] and god comes in and in that presence
[1:19:42] they're they're beginning to understand
[1:19:44] who they are that they are literally the
[1:19:46] promise that's going to come to pass
[1:19:48] because that's where we see ourselves as
[1:19:52] he does
[1:19:53] this is exactly why no one is going to
[1:19:55] cry cry
[1:19:56] foul as i've said to you before no one's
[1:19:59] going to cry foul at the judgment bar
[1:20:01] because in his presence they will know
[1:20:05] themselves as he does
[1:20:07] see
[1:20:09] putin's going to know that one day
[1:20:11] american politics are going to know that
[1:20:13] one day popes are going to know that one
[1:20:15] of these days when they stand in his
[1:20:17] presence they'll know exactly who they
[1:20:18] are
[1:20:19] because when you're in his presence
[1:20:21] that's why nobody's crying foul that's
[1:20:23] why nobody's crying unfair injustice
[1:20:25] nobody's marching and holding up signs
[1:20:26] at that trial
[1:20:28] there's no protesters outside because
[1:20:30] everybody knows i'm busted you can't
[1:20:32] come in his presence i want to tell you
[1:20:34] something friends get into his presence
[1:20:36] constantly
[1:20:37] constantly let that be your every day
[1:20:40] get into his presence because in his
[1:20:42] presence it's when he can really show
[1:20:43] you who you are where you are and what
[1:20:45] you need
[1:20:46] see
[1:20:47] and so we find then that
[1:20:50] when you know when he descended in our
[1:20:52] day that's what came to us we came into
[1:20:54] his presence and
[1:20:56] he washed us with the bleeding word and
[1:20:58] and now we see ourselves
[1:21:00] as he does
[1:21:02] see and and that's where your victory
[1:21:04] renews itself
[1:21:06] every day
[1:21:07] is seeing yourself
[1:21:09] as he sees you
[1:21:10] but when you when you go long periods of
[1:21:13] time and you're not in his presence
[1:21:15] you're going to get very discouraged
[1:21:17] very discouraged
[1:21:18] brother branham talks about how that
[1:21:21] our scientists tell us it's three
[1:21:22] minutes to midnight you know they've
[1:21:24] been saying that for a long time brother
[1:21:25] branham said it's it's long ago
[1:21:28] we were three minutes to midnight
[1:21:30] but we know this is an amazing statement
[1:21:34] he says but we know
[1:21:36] the hand of god has stopped time
[1:21:40] to wait
[1:21:42] just long-suffering
[1:21:44] like he was
[1:21:45] in the days of noah
[1:21:47] see
[1:21:48] so
[1:21:49] so you you know when you when you track
[1:21:51] it back you can see that god has been
[1:21:54] causing time to move
[1:21:57] at the space at the pace of prophecy
[1:22:01] see now i've taught on this before and
[1:22:03] i'm not going to take a lot of time and
[1:22:04] get bogged down here but when we study
[1:22:06] the trumpets you realize that everything
[1:22:08] was running at a certain pace
[1:22:10] until you get to the fifth trumpet
[1:22:12] and in the fifth trumpet a star falls
[1:22:14] from heaven that brother branham
[1:22:16] attaches to isaiah and says it's lucifer
[1:22:18] however they're fallen from heaven o
[1:22:20] lucifer's son of the morning
[1:22:22] and so that star that falls from heaven
[1:22:25] has got a key to the bottomless pit and
[1:22:27] he opens a bottomless pit now what is
[1:22:28] this what is this illustrating it's
[1:22:30] illustrating that there everything had
[1:22:32] been running at a certain pace but now
[1:22:33] it's time to pick up the pace
[1:22:36] and he's given this angel the keys to
[1:22:38] the bottomless pit so he can kind of
[1:22:40] let's get on with this
[1:22:42] we need to increase the tempo you know
[1:22:44] you got you got you got a drummer
[1:22:46] playing at a certain tempo you say hey
[1:22:48] speed it up
[1:22:50] and that's exactly what happened and and
[1:22:52] what does he do he releases the the the
[1:22:55] has the key to the bottomless pit he's
[1:22:56] been given an extra little bit of power
[1:22:58] extra little bit of authority that he
[1:23:00] never enjoyed in the earth and what's
[1:23:02] why why why because the first was coming
[1:23:06] it's right around the turn of the
[1:23:07] century and and if you'll notice because
[1:23:09] the bible says
[1:23:10] that when the enemy comes in like a
[1:23:12] flood
[1:23:14] he raises up a standard
[1:23:15] so as soon as he gives lucifer a little
[1:23:18] extra power to go and un unlock the
[1:23:20] bottomless pit and release these demons
[1:23:22] he he grabs a hold of parnum and grant
[1:23:25] and all these guys and daddy seymour and
[1:23:27] he starts the azusa revival
[1:23:29] see because when this when the enemy
[1:23:31] comes like a flood god raises up a
[1:23:32] standard so god's keeping this thing
[1:23:34] balanced oh my god
[1:23:35] he's keeping this thing balanced friends
[1:23:37] because what did it do and that that ran
[1:23:39] all the way till it ran the first woe
[1:23:41] out in the and the first wall would have
[1:23:42] just kept going first of all the second
[1:23:44] third woe but what did he do he stopped
[1:23:46] time he's throttled it he's got his hand
[1:23:48] on a governor
[1:23:49] and he's saying okay we need a little
[1:23:50] prophecy we need a little movement okay
[1:23:52] let's go look okay stop stop stop stop
[1:23:54] okay let's go let's go okay stop stop
[1:23:55] stop stop and that's why you see the
[1:23:57] history and the way you do suddenly the
[1:23:59] whole world is a big conflagration and
[1:24:01] the whole world goes to war over nothing
[1:24:04] over nothing uh uh you know here's a
[1:24:07] leader of austria gets assassinated as
[1:24:09] if leaders don't get assassinated and
[1:24:11] next thing it starts as a world war
[1:24:15] are you kidding
[1:24:16] and you you've even got you've even got
[1:24:19] king george and you've got kaiser
[1:24:21] wilhelm and you've got nicholas in
[1:24:23] russia and you've you've got the the
[1:24:25] french king and they're all they're all
[1:24:26] cousins
[1:24:27] they're all related
[1:24:29] and they're all writing each other
[1:24:30] letters and and and you know they're
[1:24:32] they're writing now george we don't want
[1:24:34] to fight oh oh come on we'll willy willy
[1:24:37] we don't mama don't want us to fight
[1:24:39] come on call your armies oh yeah no
[1:24:41] problem and somebody somebody write to
[1:24:42] nikki and ask nikki to stand down and
[1:24:44] and we'll everything will be good and
[1:24:46] you know what when you've got the whole
[1:24:47] leaders and the kings and the czars and
[1:24:49] everybody trying to stop it and nobody
[1:24:51] can stop it over one assassination
[1:24:55] and you think history's an accident i'm
[1:24:57] here to tell you it's driven by prophecy
[1:25:01] and now what are you living in you're
[1:25:02] living in an accelerated time under the
[1:25:05] lasting effects of the second woe which
[1:25:07] are going to run all the way into the
[1:25:08] tribulation period and you're finding
[1:25:10] that's why there's been no cessation of
[1:25:12] global war since the end of world war ii
[1:25:15] i mean they're those men in iwo jima
[1:25:17] were just a few years later fighting in
[1:25:19] korea and their sons fighting in vietnam
[1:25:22] and their sons fighting in the persian
[1:25:23] gulf and their sons fighting in
[1:25:24] afghanistan and now you got ukraine i
[1:25:26] mean you've got bosnia you've got all
[1:25:28] these things it's never going to be
[1:25:30] peace now
[1:25:32] because why the third woe cometh quickly
[1:25:35] hallelujah and god has his hand
[1:25:38] modulating it god has his hand on the
[1:25:40] throttle governor it speeds up it slows
[1:25:42] down it speeds up it slows down why
[1:25:44] because god has been preparing a bride
[1:25:47] out of this day to take a flight home
[1:25:49] and i'm here to tell you it's coming on
[1:25:52] time
[1:25:53] it's not going to be one day late the
[1:25:56] rapture is coming exactly when it needs
[1:25:58] to come
[1:26:03] absolutely
[1:26:06] that's what you see happening in ukraine
[1:26:08] listen friends
[1:26:10] i'm here to tell you
[1:26:11] i can tell you the future
[1:26:14] and i'm not a prophet don't need to be
[1:26:17] see
[1:26:18] i
[1:26:19] i can look at prophecy just like just
[1:26:21] like when kobe first hit i said hey
[1:26:23] let's not live in fear because there'll
[1:26:25] be five more behind that one
[1:26:27] ten more behind those
[1:26:29] that's what we've seen
[1:26:30] the world's ending
[1:26:33] the the world order not the planet the
[1:26:35] world order
[1:26:37] i've said to you man's six thousand year
[1:26:39] run
[1:26:40] his six thousand year run in a falling
[1:26:42] condition is coming to an end
[1:26:45] god's restoring us to eden
[1:26:47] we're going back friends
[1:26:49] just as sure as anything it can't stop
[1:26:51] it
[1:26:52] and i i mean i don't know i i have no
[1:26:54] prophecy or quotes to tell you the
[1:26:56] outcome of what's going to happen in
[1:26:57] ukraine but that that that's that's
[1:27:00] and i don't mean to minimalize it but
[1:27:02] i'm i'm here to tell you there's a much
[1:27:03] larger picture going on
[1:27:06] you know what you know what you know
[1:27:07] what putin is finding out right now
[1:27:10] you can't fight the beast
[1:27:14] and i've been watching the headlines and
[1:27:15] i've been reading very very closely and
[1:27:18] constantly they're making these
[1:27:20] statements about this this cooperation
[1:27:22] between western powers and even even now
[1:27:26] even baltic states and and even nato and
[1:27:29] non-nato countries are starting to go
[1:27:31] yeah yeah come on you know cut off their
[1:27:33] money
[1:27:34] pinch them bring sanctions and it's not
[1:27:36] just sanctions i mean they had sanctions
[1:27:38] on korean sanctions in 2014. just little
[1:27:41] just little
[1:27:43] bad boy
[1:27:44] vladimir
[1:27:46] shame on you
[1:27:48] give back crimea no okay whatever
[1:27:53] but now
[1:27:54] see it's not about fighting with armies
[1:27:57] the bible tells us in revelation chapter
[1:28:00] 13 our chapter
[1:28:02] that that it is this beast that gives
[1:28:05] power to the image
[1:28:07] you understand nobody can defeat that
[1:28:09] dragon
[1:28:10] and you know what's happening you know
[1:28:11] what you know what's actually happening
[1:28:13] russia is learning
[1:28:15] that
[1:28:16] that eventually it's going to get now it
[1:28:18] can't get there yet because we're still
[1:28:20] here so it can't come to its fullness
[1:28:23] but he's learning that you can't buy or
[1:28:25] sell except you agree with the beast
[1:28:27] unless you're willing to work with the
[1:28:29] beast system unless you're really
[1:28:31] willing to work and take a mark on your
[1:28:33] forehead or your hand and either agree
[1:28:36] with us or work or work with us then
[1:28:38] guess what you're not going to buy or
[1:28:40] sell and oh my they're trying to change
[1:28:42] their currency to the gold standard and
[1:28:43] try to stabilize the ruble against the
[1:28:45] dollar and they're trying to make deals
[1:28:46] with china and deals with north korea it
[1:28:48] ain't going to matter
[1:28:50] i'm here to tell you china's going to
[1:28:52] find out also north korea is going to
[1:28:54] find out also the radical islam is going
[1:28:56] to find out also you can't fight this be
[1:28:59] system it rules the world
[1:29:03] and how does it do it through commerce
[1:29:06] through craft through business
[1:29:09] hallelujah friends these things aren't
[1:29:11] an accident ain't because somebody had a
[1:29:12] good idea we better get all together and
[1:29:14] so at the end time russia might go crazy
[1:29:16] we better have something to do this is
[1:29:18] all god with his hand on prophecy
[1:29:21] this is all god he sent a prophet
[1:29:23] exactly on time he say i wish he'd have
[1:29:25] found me when he found you exactly when
[1:29:27] he needed to find you i wish this that
[1:29:29] it never happened god knew exactly what
[1:29:31] needed to happen in your life and i'm
[1:29:33] here to tell you melchizedek that that
[1:29:36] priesthood that baptism of the holy
[1:29:38] ghost that continuation of god moving in
[1:29:41] the earth it's coming to its climax
[1:29:48] that's what's going to happen
