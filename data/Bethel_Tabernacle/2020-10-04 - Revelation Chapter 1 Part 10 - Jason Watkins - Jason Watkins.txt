TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uh praise the lord good morning greetings to you all in the name of the lord we're going to begin this morning back in our series on the book of revelation and we are trying to if by the help of the lord i want to get through chapter one and kind of make a bridge kind of uh hit the breach here that's going to connect the ages before you actually need before we start into the ages i want to make a few connections so we'll begin reading i think last time we stopped at 11. um let's start from there revelation 1 11. i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus unto smyrna and to pergamos under thyatira onto sardis and unto philadelphia and unto laodicea and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with the garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice says the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength when i and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of death and of hell write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter the mystery of the seven stars which thou saust in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches may the lord bless the reading of his word now we when we were ending last time a couple of sundays ago we're just kind of sharing the sunday school class duties uh with brother jason demars and and so and also brother matt'll no doubt be taking part in that as well but we're looking to try to get through the book of revelation as i've explained to you in the uh recently that we're not doing as exhaustive of a search as we will on the podcast i'm doing more in overview so we'll move quite a bit quicker i just want to hit major points we were ending last time on the need to operate in the spirit because the principle that we've discussed for revelation the book of revelation is it is the bride's book of the end time when we find and that's why you'll find paul not quoting from it because when john brings it back paul has already gone home it's not sent to re-establish new teaching or further teaching it's sent to quantify and qualify everything that had been up to that point remember that the book of revelation is the continuation of the ministry of jesus christ only now in his church whereas it had been god moving above israel and then god walking in jesus christ we remember various points to give us clarity on the godhead and it's these points of why many don't understand the godhead and that is because that when we look at and we say the word christ everybody automatically just thinks of jesus of nazareth but we realize that he was his name was jesus long before he was ever born the book of ephesians in the third chapter tells us and teaches us that that jesus is the one who created the world uh and but yet genesis says god did it so we find that john will tell us that there was not anything made that was made outside of jesus christ making it we realize that it's simply god expressing himself so when we begin to look at great servants of god and we consider moses moses was a was jesus christ in a portion and he was christ the anointed word he was not the nazarene he was christ the anointed word that's why a prophet in this day would say referring to jeremiah jeremiah was christ only meaning that he was a portion of the anointed word on display we find that when jesus was born of a woman he was then the fullness of that godhead entirely in a human body he was all the prophets priests and kings he didn't make him a second person it made him the fullness of the original person now made manifest as a kinsmen redeemer but we realize that jesus there was never a plan when they wanted to move him into his king and make him a king and he knew that that couldn't happen at that time because the kingdom would be a kingdom of saints and there's got to be saints born and now the only way that you can be born is you are a saint means a sanctified one and that only comes by the life of christ because that only god's life is the only life holy enough that for god to accept god cannot accept the life of any man he can only accept his own life and so we realized that now god has got to get his life that's the task how does god get his life into his family's life because they're born in sin enter jesus christ amen he comes in and he he says the except a corn of wheat die it abideth alone so we see that god was never intending to stay bottled up in a single man walking the shores of galilee now comes the book of revelation because now we find that the holy ghost has come and the book of revelation is sent to explain god's working now not in a nazarene walking the shores of galilee but working in his body the church the bride as john would refer to her the elect lady so this is what the book of revelation is all about this is hence the instructions that john says i was in the spirit on the lord's day and so we realized we've proven already don't need to go back over this morning that we are in the day of the lord this is the lord's day and therefore this book becomes prominent to our age it was written sealed up that first stage fell away they couldn't go on to the to the resurrection of the bodies they couldn't get their body changed that's where they were headed they had a perfect ministry they had the full jubilee they had the full abstract they had the full token they had the uh they had the mighty god unveiled they they were ready for invisible union but they begin to fall away after the death of the apostles hence christ must sit down seal the book in seven seals sent back down on the throne rather than stepping forward to take his bride he now must intercede for her across 2000 years of church history promising at the end time that he would once again step forward come forward take the book loose the seals and bring it down to his seventh messenger and then that messenger would take it and feed it to a bride who then now we find ourselves picking back up at the apex where the first age begin to decline we carry it on to the body change this bride of this last day like unlike every other age she's the only one uniquely predestinated to not fall eve fell israel fail when they chose a king they they they the wife of adam fell the wife of jehovah fell when they sought the prophet for a king and the king the prophet tried to tell them god is your king but they wanted man made a system of religion they wanted somebody ruling over them and so they chose a king they chose human government and they committed adultery against god as calling him their true husband we find that the bride of jesus christ fell as she began to fall away by the time you reach the the third age it means married and then the fourth age opens up that she's now they've triple crowned a false prophet and she's dead now god can begin the restoration because that's what he promised he would do all right so just just overviewing a bit uh as we move forward i'm just trying to watch my time so when we come down through our scriptures we find that he's speaking this letter this revelation that god gave unto christ so that christ could give it to the churches all right so now we realize it's not a different god it's just god working in various stages so john says in verse 12 i turned to see the voice notice he didn't turn to see a man he says i turned to see a voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven lampstands seven golden candlesticks this would represent the church of which christ was walking in the midst of you read that in verse 13. but we find that in verse 13 he's in the midst of seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man so we realize then that one likened to the son of man gerd about the paps shows that now it's entering into he's not gerd about the waste like the priesthood would do offering sacrifices now we're at the time of the day of the lord this is the day of the lord now he's coming in his church she's gird about the paps because it identifies it as a woman but it's christ but it's christ in her and it's the time of the the end it's the day of the lord it's the time when the judgments are coming and so now he his head verse 14 his head and his hairs are white like wool now we're back to daniel the seventh chapter the ancient of days that sat on the throne this is where brother branham had such a hard time understanding this one whose hairs were white as wool as white as snow white like wool as white as snow and brother branham said you know he's he's a young man how is he look like an old man this was this was jack's um you know his friend brother jack tried to give him that brother branham said but that just that just didn't seem to work out until the spirit led brother branham back to daniel and he picks it up and realizes that this is the ancient of days come for judgment and so we realize now that that the that the judgments are upon the earth but we realize that the last horse rider uh the pale horse rider cannot begin his full ride he's named by the prophet he's identified as death and a prophet and a prophet in this day shows that it's the conglomeration of all the previous horses but thank god we also have all the previous anointings the lion the ox the man and it's all in the eagle because the eagle is not an earthbound creature the lion the man and the ox are earthbound this is the age that takes a rapture this is the bride under an eagle and and the pale horse rider cannot begin his full ride in earnest until this bride is taken out of the way but before she can be taken out of the way christ must wait and intercede for every name that's still on that lamb's book of life and when that last name is called then we're taken in a physical rapture and we believe in a physical rapture brother branham to his dying day believed in the corporal return of the lord jesus christ we meet him in the air we are changed into glorified bodies that's what believers believe brother branham said so we realized then but now but now we're so now we're finishing up we're reestablishing the original teaching had to be re-established because the full token has to come the full abstract has to return back remember that we found him the alpha and the omega and brother branham shows us in numerous places it doesn't say he's in the middle now of course he's in he's in the in between because you can read it christ is in the midst of the seven lamp stands but he so he is in the midst of his church but it's simply saying that the why he only says alpha and omega and not any anything in between simply means that in the alpha he's in his fullness and in the omega he's in his fullness but the in between while he's in the in between not everything in the in between is him because by this time men have added their doctrines and creeds and dogmas and the church has become polluted she went into the ground god's going to raise her back up but clearly we are at the end time the judgment day his head and his hairs are white like wool verse 15 his feet like undefined brass these are the areas i'm not going to dive down deep into we'll get these in the podcast his voice says the sound of many waters we're at the age where we've had 2 000 years so it's many waters we are today uh carrying the baton that was handed off to each new age and now the whole package has been handed back to the hands of the bride and so now the whole world god will be just and condemning him because they didn't have the voice of a few waters they've had the voice of god through 2 000 years the voice of many waters it's his voice it's the judgment brother branham showed us all right verse 16 in his right hand seven stars out of his mouth sharp two-edged sword there's a lot we could break down in there his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength if as long as you keep daniel in play you'll understand revelation i think there's only uh i don't think there's see how does this go everything that is covered in daniel is covered in revelation and in all of revelation only two chapters don't refer back to something out of daniel so we find that these correlate together and the study of daniel really brings out this verses especially 12 down through uh 16. all right and so um verse 17 and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not i'm the first and the last verse 18 i'm he that liveth and was dead and behold i live forevermore he's got the keys of death in hell verse 19 he's writing the things watch this now the things which must be seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter so we find then of course the mystery he gives the mystery in verse 20 of the stars and the candlesticks so the things which then must be hereafter you find that when he when he's writing write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter so we're realizing it's prophecy so revelation 1 and 3 uh blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy prophecy is future revelation 1 19 write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter so that's prophecy so that's why brother branham could place so much of this and say this is the day of these things because it's mostly prophecy chapter 22 and 7 behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book 22 18 for i testify under every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book revelation 22 19 and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy constantly it's prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book so we see then that it's foretelling because it starts out for telling and it's going to show jesus in his future works of what he as the word is going to do in future ages not what he's only done in three and a half years of human ministry but what he as the word now not as the nazarene the same christ and as the word in a people he's going to move all right and we find him you know uh all the way over in you know all the way over in the in the end of the book still declaring it's a book of prophecy all right he deals with revelation 1 20 the mystery of the seven stars and the golden candlesticks and there's seven angels and seven churches and so you know this is this is exactly what god said to abraham when he said to abraham look to the stars tell me can you count them so i can't count them said well that's your seed those stars represent your seed galatians 3 and 6. we read that now to abraham look now to abraham galatians 3 16 and his seed were the promises made he he saith not unto seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ and so so now out of all uh those that are in christ watch this now so out of all those that are in christ out of all of those stars of god out of all the seed of abraham out of all the believers seven of them are held particularly in his right hand to be deployed in the seven church ages and so now they are for god's purpose they are angels they are messengers to the seven ages they're not supernatural winged creatures we we find that out these are men that god has taken a hold of for a purpose so john 13 20 verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me lot more to say on that perhaps in the service later today and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me so we realize that if these seven messengers are seven stars in the right hand of god and he sends them to an age then to receive their message is to receive christ and we realize then that that people who try to say i believe in jesus of nazareth but then they reject the messenger god has sent you can see the log jam that that puts them they have failed the very first word test and so we find them that that god's family the seed of christ are seen as stars he's got seven of them in his right hand for a particular purpose but it's why do you receive the messenger of a star because you're part of the constellation see and so revelation 1 20. i'm going to start winding it up here for today so revelation 1 20 starts the unveiling of the symbols so the candlesticks are the churches seven stars of the messengers seven candlesticks of the sevenfold glory of his person all right his hand in his hair all right represent a judge his eyes are as a flame of fire why because it's the day of the lord and so this is the this is the day he's in judgment you know it's it's it's not the it's not to the world who have rejected him and indicted him he's a judge he's not the gentle lamb he's a judge see but to the bride he's still the lamb of god he's still her atonement he's still her intercessor he's still her companion and you're going to need him until you get out of here trust me and so now you've got to understand that you've got a dual thing happening he's speaking to the bride by the word and the word only which means no mongrelizing of man-made idea it's back to the pure word it's not teaching and teaching only paul said i came not to you in in teaching or word only but in power and demonstration of the holy ghost so back to word and word only you've got to have that to get the restoration of the full complete power so now we realize that his feet then his feet are not like the ones that walk the streets of jerusalem offering grace but rather they're like brass that burned in a fire and he why are they because they're here to stomp out everything that gets in his way everything the enemy does in this last age i'm here to tell you you don't have to worry jesus walks right over the top of it so his voice is the voice of many waters preachers through the ages what's in his right hand stars what about his mouth his mouth his mouth has the word of god his countenance was as the sun shineth in its strength so so then when we when we realize as we're going now to chapter two which is where we're going to break into next time you've got to so every age you're going to find several things consistent every age has their test of the word so so we find out that that whatever the word however it's manifested you've got to build off of that revelation just like you know how how to build the ark there's probably all kinds of boat ship builders in the days of noah but noah wasn't building a ship he wasn't building a mercy hospital ship he was building an ark an ark is what they put the testaments in the ark of the covenant why it represents christ it doesn't represent man-made ingenuity you'll never escape the judgments on man-made ingenuity you're going to have to pass the word test and receive god in the form of his word and so we realized from abraham and lot right on down to the time of jesus those others were parts of jesus but jesus was the fullness of the word he comes to the jews they were the elected people the fullness of the word and then and then so now being the elected people he presented himself to them first but paul picks up in the 13th chapter talking to the jews in their day and we'll stop here then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles so so the jews rejected it but god had already said they would yeah amen in isaiah god was already going to blind them and paul speaking of that blindness talks about how that what then israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for romans 11 7 but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded so the reason he blinded them was so that god could turn from the jews to the gentiles because the scripture said had declared that god would take out of the people a bride for uh from the gentiles so he calls israel his wife to jehovah but he calls the true church the bride of christ amen so that's where we'll stop today we're just trying to get launched in that's that chapter one really has to be established firmly in your mind before we move heavily into chapters two and three because that covers the ages let's pray father we thank you for your word today thank you for the audience here among us and those streaming at home we commit the rest of the service and the balance of this day into your perfect control we commit it to you in jesus christ's name amen god bless you thank you for being here today god bless you we'll see you shortly with the main service god bless
