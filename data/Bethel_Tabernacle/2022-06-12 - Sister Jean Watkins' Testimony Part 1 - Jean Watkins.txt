========================================

okay i'm not used to this i'm so glad y'all came [Music] senior youth especially uh actually what happened i said i wanted to give one of my testimonies to the other testimonies from the senior use and it went up in the sanctuary so anyway i'm a senior except i'm an old singer so um i wanted i wanted to share my testimony with y'all as you can see on the screen it's just a portion of my journey it's not my whole journey uh we'd be here this time next week if i tell the whole journey but um most people can remember back till they're two and a half three years old some people feather some people not as far i remember something and i think matthew has a picture i want to see if any of y'all recognize this picture poisonous oh i'm sorry i'm not a preacher jesus needed a sanctuary they teased me enough about me well i was a pastor one time but they grew up on me so anyway so you got them pictures matthew so anyway i remember back when i was two and a half or three years old most of you do if you add i'm gonna tell you this is my story you all passed yes i don't care how old you are everybody has a story and if you look go back in your life as far as you can think and this is where mine starts does anybody know who this lady is if i recognize him all right christopher that's not fair well i tell you who it is it's my grandmother it's my grandmother that's as far back as i remember i would have been about that was my daddy's mom i would have been about two and a half three years old or something like that i remember going to grandma's house one day and she had a good cook stove and we all lived on the same street we lived on west 15th street in north carolina grandma lived a couple houses below us i was in her house one day and she had a wood cook stove most people did and i remember what are you doing she was putting something in the stove and she was making cookies i know we got a lot of cookie making grandmas in here now i was not a cookie making grandma i confess that you can ask my boys i was not but i when i went to the store i bought them the best cookies that store had the us that was mine well anyway that was my grandmother the next thing i remember back in my youth i was exactly three and a half years old i have documents for that that's how i know how that was i went to grandma's house and it something was strange to you gotta think three and a half year old thought something was strange it was different all the furniture had been moved out of the room and then set up some folding chairs and i looked and over on one side of the wall was a casket someone lifted me up literally my grandmother hefner in the casket that was my first experience with you come into the world you're gonna die if you don't go in the rapture that was 1944 the war was still going on during that time world war ii now america we didn't have fighting over here but our voice was fighting in the other country and it was a scary time for a child i think about them little kids in ukraine they're never going to get over this because you just don't get over it because we didn't have words that i was terrified because we had blackout curtains during the war you had blackout curtains i remember seeing my dad and put up a blackout curtain dead what weren't you doing that for you had to close all your all your windows no car lights no street lights everything pitch black because we were under threats of wartime and the cold war after that and if if a plane flew over with bombs you didn't want to be a target for them that's why we had blackout birds then as a child you know you hear talk as a child i never hear him talk about a jew oh what's a jesus i never heard that name before that's the first time i've ever heard the name of a jew and so anyway have any of y'all ever saw a flying saucer are you going to see one now 1947 the same time israel was becoming a nation and the angel of the lord was appearing to brother brown an airline pilot saw something in the sky and he called it a flying saucer now we know it's not they know now it's ufos unidentified flying objects we know it's investigating angels so i'm six years old and i go outside where's that flying saucer i don't i didn't see the flying saucer but there was a great fear on me because i was a child you hear talk about war and every little sound i would hear in the night it was a plane going to drop a bomb on us i remember one night in particular we lived in a two-story house on old house and mama slept with the little ones then the bigger one slept in another bed and you had to go clean around the other side of the house to go to bed daddy's bed he had a half bed between bed i woke up one night terrified i was just i was about four or five years old and i was trembling i was so scared well if because i guess i heard noises and i thought was gonna be bombed or something i don't know if i can just get the daddy and get in bed every day we all know how protective daddy's hard well i couldn't get better mama other kids was in there well if i'm just getting better daddy i'll be okay so i get up in the dark pitch black spooky house and walked all the way around today's room if i'm just getting better with daddy off i'll be okay there was daddy in the bed sound asleep so was my little brother in the bed i couldn't get in bed with daddy he only had a twin so i stood there just shaking shaking and daddy woke up i don't know why but daddy woke up and asked me what i wanted to drink water so he put me back to the bedroom where i slept and he went out on the porch because our our water was out on the back porch uh we called it a spigot i don't know what you'll call it today but we got water out of it so anyway that that was that was really a scary time my mom and dad didn't go to church they weren't christians they were good people mom and dad were good upright citizens worked hard took care of those kids but they weren't christians but my ain't that that was the picture of my mom and dad when they were young they weren't christians but my aunt now did and she lived right up the street from us and she was daddy's sister and around about a block on 13th street was a methodist church and she would combine because we walked everywhere she would come by on sunday morning and take me and my little brother to to sunday school that impacted us i still have the certificate where i got from that sunday school 1947. and ain't now still to this day has a special place in my heart for taking me to sunday school and then 1948 come back and in 1948 before they come out with the polio vaccine every summer parents were terrified for their children adults too but mainly children and my mama had a younger brother me and him were the same age we were seven years old he took polio now we were children couldn't go nowhere you couldn't leave your house you couldn't leave the yard adults not children and he died with polio within a matter of days and so did his little playmate that was the same age they both died with polio i'm thankful for the that we're not troubled with that a lot anymore then a little bit longer i was in the third grade and just got in the third grade and we moved out to the country in a place called potty woods now y'all are not going yeah we lived in a chicken house it was mentally ill they told us it was a little we moved from a two-story house it was a little four-room house they said it used to be a chicken house and they made it we lived in it so we lived there when i was in the third grade we moved there when i was in third grade and then in the fourth grade they you know how schools have events i guess they still they did back when i was a kid you know you'd have special events um that wouldn't have a lot of musical events um they would come through and hold whole things and then they would have talent contests so i was in the fourth grade so they knew my son so they wanted different ones more than me to enter the shower contest so well okay but i didn't have a way we was out in the country on the dirt road but the neighbors were going and the neighbors invited me to ride with them now i'm walking up to their house i'm 10 years old i'm walking up to their house on the dirt road and i'm praying now where did i learn to pray not for my mom and dad they weren't christians and i prayed a prayer i don't know why i prayed it but i prayed it i said lord if you just let me win this contest i promise i'll go to church well i won that contest did i go to church no i didn't have a church to go to we were out in the country we didn't have a car then and there was no church available so no but you know god expects us even as children to keep our word now where did i learn to pray and ask god i'll go back i got that from my nail taking me to sunday school it's very important to take children with something school it marked me for life wow you got a pastor today because of that and grandson because that folks some great grandsons one day hopefully i know you're right started off real good [Music] anyway we moved back into town we moved a lot we moved back into town and when we moved back into town my mother and daddy both worked in cotton mills we had a lot of factories back there and that is you could two three minutes you could be at daddy's work well there were men at daddy's work from the baptist church and they were wanting to hold a prayer meeting in our home and so um they were i guess trying to get members for the baptist church and they were going around that when they said a prayer meeting it wasn't getting down and praying it was little many church services that was what it was so anyway during that time that was going on i was 11 years old and i was playing with one of my friends in the neighborhood one day named katie and then her were playing and her family had an old gentleman to come visit i don't remember his name i just remember he come out talking to me and k and he taught us how to play patty cake probably a lot of you girls know how to play that we didn't know how but we sure wore it out after he taught us well he taught us something else that i've never forgotten stuck with me all my life he taught us about a drunk a man named tom gray back then you could write a song about people and call their name nowadays you probably get lawsuits but his name was tom gray and he was a bad drunk matthew he was a bad drunk that's beautiful really so now here's the story he told about concrete tom gray lay down on the bar room floor having drank so much he couldn't drink anymore and he fell asleep with the trouble grown to dream that he rode on the hillbound train the engine with blood was red and down and dismal lit the brimstone mount an elk for fuel was shoveling bones and the furnace roared with a thousand grounds the boiler was filled with lag or deer and the devil himself was the engineer the passengers made such a motley crew church members also gentle and few richmond and broadhoff and bakers and rags handsome young ladies and weather dope hats yellow and black men red and white chained off together a horrible sight faster and faster the engine flew wilder and wider the country grew louder and louder the thunder clash brighter and brighter the lightning flashed hotter and hotter the air became too close were burned from each quivering frame and in the distance was hurting to cry oh ho crook the devil we're here in hell oh how passengers shriek with pain begged the devil to stop the train but he scampered about him he danced with glee and laughed and joked in their agony my faithful friends you have done my work and the devil can never a painful shirt you voted the weak you brought the poor and the hungry brother have turned from your door you've gathered up gold brick haters rust and given free bent to your hellish lust you've drank and rotted and murdered in light and mocked at god in your health on christ get faithful fair so i'll carry you through for it's only right that you get your due for every labor is worth his hair so i'm glad you say in my lake of fire where my pharynx will torment you forever all in vain you will cry for a savior then tom wilker with an awful cry his clothes soaking wet his hair standing high and he prayed as he never prayed before to be safe from heaven the devil's power his crying and praying was not in vain for he never more rude on that hillbound train about that same time those men where my daddy worked they wanted to hold a prayer meeting our home and they did but i was out playing probably right doing this and they held a prayer meeting in their home i was 11 years old and my mom and daddy both give their lives to the lord they both got saved that's looking back that's where we started and here we come then jason and jonathan and matthew christopher all of y'all jonathan gideon all y'all that's where you started with my mom and dad for my nail too mom and daddy both got saved did they get the real goods yes they did mom and daddy really changed it really changed their life so we started going to church our church was clean across town east first met this church that's the exact church right now that i went to and because and we had you know little ones we couldn't walk it's a good two miles maybe maybe more and so they had a church bus and they were serving we went there service we did not miss a service we loved church so they'd send the church bus after us and we we go to church and and and i had become a real lover of reading books biographies mostly and i was at the library knowing stop getting books and just different things like that i met a girl in school become a friend i go visit her we go visit my grandma moves so we had kind of a really a full life because we were in church all the time i studied in church and i loved church we loved church one sunday um mama had a sister lived up towards the mountains they rose and she got a chance to go visit her well daddy never went but we all went that day and that night or that afternoon we got back on sunday and i'm thinking i gotta get back i gotta get back in time uh the church of us will come and daddy will go and i go i gotta go i gotta be there i'm i might have been 12 years old 11 or 12 something like that so i'm rushing him on my mind i gotta get back i gotta go to church with daddy so we got back and daddy was gone i was devastated then church message doesn't come daddy was coming well it was probably a good two miles it's getting dark but i took off running now i could run i and so i took off another sidewalks all the way in in the houses everywhere i wasn't alone because it was a lot of houses a lot of sidewalks i run run run and then you get to the end of the sidewalks and there's a road just like this no sidewall over here is pitch black woods dogs bark and howling on this side in more woods in little field dogs pitch black it's dark it's nice what am i gonna do i could see the church up here because i could see its lights but everything between was spooky dark dogs dark in heaven i was terrified it's another mile and a half back home and it's pitch black back home i was in a dilemma you know what i did i took off running you would have never caught me i run so fast there was a church i run across the yard up the steps in the church i was saved so anyway i love church didn't want to miss church one time now it was in warm weather um daddy worked on second shift and so they had a revival now we were baptist uh that was the church we went to east 1st street baptist church good little church good people wonderful people and we went to this little pentecostal church revival now we knew better but we didn't then mom and daddy were brand new christians the visiting preacher was a woman it was a woman preacher she was pretty good so we went and and they said there was a man there come in with crutches and live without but we've never heard nothing like that before so we went back again and i don't remember if we went two times or three times but the last night we were there they had a service and they had of some sort of an altar called but remember exactly what it was and now i'm 11 years old this time and there's a great desire and need to go to the answer never had that before didn't know what to do about it but i had just a deep desire go to the altar go to the altar so i turned to my friend janie the preacher's daughter i was sitting by her and her mother the preacher's wife and i told jamie i said jenny i feel like i need to go to the doctor i never knew nothing about more than the auditor mom and daddy got saved in the house so and i wasn't even naked but anyway she said we'll go on it no no no no no i'm about to look her about myself and so her mother said come on we'll go with you so they got in they took me up to the altar okay we get to the altar now what really julia had never been before now so we got up there and we got down and down so now this is something we don't do but these are pentacles and they were they were the real people so i just followed their instructions his mother her mother here jamie here just say hallelujah so they started saying i never heard that word before that was greek to me i never heard the word hallelujah before in my life so they started saying hallelujah hallelujah okay i started saying it hallelujah hallelujah then something happened all of a sudden from out of nowhere i jumped up and screamed hallelujah and run around the pulpit she gave me the strongest look but i guess it was strange i didn't do that that was a supernatural experience god led me to go to that altar it was a force i didn't feel it all i knew was and i screamed and i run around and i it was a warm preacher i knew it was not a good move we were kind of isolated i'm a teenager i'm about 14 15 years old and you don't isolate a teenager and you don't take them more i went to the library two or three times a week i had no library to go to we didn't have a car we didn't have a phone we didn't have to we had nothing and we also didn't have church because the church bus didn't come out that far so here we were and you know you must go to church you will spiritually die you will wither away i saw my mama get in that condition not my daddy so much as my mama because daddy was gone at work a long time along during the day he wasn't home that much during the day he was at work and fellowshipping with his baptist friends but me and mama and it was just not it was just not good and i didn't understand my mama and my mama didn't understand now on up till then men momma had a very good relationship but once we moved to the country and got out of church and things were bad i didn't understand a moment she didn't understand me and i actually wanted to run away from home i didn't get the nerve up that's a good thing i didn't sometimes it's gonna be a little chicken run away from moments if somebody come to me come on let's run away from home we went i hated i literally hated my whole life and i become convinced my mama hated me now i know better now and later i knew better but you know teenagers it could be a problem i got very depressed very discouraged very bitter and then mama was out of work daddy had surgery and he was out of work pretty bad so when i was 16 and a half i went job hunting and i found a job in a factory i was away from home that was good so i enjoyed i enjoyed my job because it got me away from home and daddy got us a car and then uh daddy taught me how to drive a car and then mama went back to work and she got off from work at 10 o'clock at night so what i would do when i come home from work i would get in the car while it was still daylight and drive into town and me and my cousin would hang out shirley jean was my cousin and then hazel come along daddy's sister which i knew hazel we were friends as children and uh so we all started hanging out together until 12 o'clock at night and then i'd have to i'd have to go pick up mama from work and then mama go home and that was every day through the week because i wouldn't drive let them come to roads and dark by myself so anyway we just hang out and do that well during that time my future husband had been in north africa in the navy and he he come home he was getting ready to get out and so he started riding around with us and you all know the rest so anyway so in 1958 we got married and uh two years later we had our first child lisa and then eddie come from a divorced family and uh it was not good because well it just wasn't good he come from a divorced family when he was very small and he always looked out for his mother he uh he went to work when he was 12 years old and then when time he was 16 17 he was working two jobs to help help his mama and his baby sister hazel and then he went into the navy and he was sending her home money from the navy he watched out after his mother then in 1961 at 50 years old she had a heart attack and she died and when she died he had always all his life you well you couldn't find a harder worker than my husband was from time he was a little boy he was still trying to work on up to the lord took him he lost his weight he started rifting he didn't leave home but he wasn't there for us and it made it made it hard and then we moved into this little furnished apartment and it was really not good because lisa was just i was pregnant with my second child and lisa was maybe 15 months old something like that and he would he would go and leave home and do his thing all day long every day and being hurt there by ourselves no tv no books no nothing i cried she cried i cried we both cried and it was very gloomy well i got very suicidal i was suicidal i had to get out i couldn't take it no more i just had to get out of the situation i didn't know no way out so then five months later eddie's brother-in-law died 31 years old and when he died his name was bob keener and when he died he left a wife with four young boys and it was suggested to us because we didn't have any certain dwelling place because eddie still was drifting loss we would stay with lena and the boys temporarily i was seven months pregnant we would just stay with her temporarily you know and then and then help her when she first lost her husband she worked also so we did that and um that was rough too because she was gone all day eddie was gone all day still drifting and here i am pregnant with a toddler and four little boys and it was just it was just not it was just bad for me and i'm sure it wasn't easy for lena so what happened then leona like she was the oldest sister of the family and she took the place of a mama and she talked to him and he listened to her eddie you've got to get to work you've got to get a place for your family to live and he did so when the baby was born when he was two weeks old we moved into an apartment with lena's health and she was a wonderful sister-in-law wonderful person somebody had to work somebody had to have money coming in i had felt trapped now i'm not trapped anymore i'll get a job i had a a five-week-old baby a 17-month old toddler and eddie come down with double pneumonia for two weeks he was been faced so me and my sister-in-law eddie's brother's wife we went job hunt we found a job but it was quite an ordeal just to get to it it was in several different towns we had to go through and we had to take the babies to my family and my sister took care of them we didn't get off 12 o'clock at night so that was hard and and we've done it for a while and then jane it would just become impossible for her to do it so we had to move closer in because when she left for work she could just pick me up so that's what we did we we rented an old house in newton the town i was raised in during the time when we were moving into the house spent two nights at my mom and daddy's house it was an old farmhouse and upstairs mom and dad slept upstairs and they had an extra bed up there so me and lisa and timmy his name was timmy timothy and um we slept and so now i'm working till 12 o'clock at night i'm exhausted i'm tired and sleepy a baby here a baby here well i couldn't go to sleep i'd roll over on so it was a restless night well the next night eddie stayed there and mama had a brand new auction couch just brand new her first one ever and um during the night so in order to get some sleep i left the little baby down in the chair because he was small enough he could fit in the chair and eddie could watch him and i'd have lisa and i could i might get a little sleep and i must have went sound asleep because in the night my daddy started hollering at me jing jing go see about that baby what's wrong with that baby i didn't even hear that baby i was so gone so i staggered down the steps and i guess for some reason mama followed me and when we got down there um eddie smoked and he dropped a cigarette and it caught on his couch on fire and he was laying in the fire now that baby timothy means guardian angels and from god save all of our lives that night wow me and mama liked to not got eddie up because he was so out we drug him off the couch and thrown him outside and well anyway we didn't spend another night at mom once i was here [Laughter] my daddy crazy house i'm getting out of here so okay but wind's moving in his other house so we were working we were like ships passing in the money because i worked till midnight we were too late we didn't see that where he had been drifting we had also drifted um i don't if if we hadn't got saved i doubt we'd stay together over time we'd probably been a typical divorce like a lot of them are thank god we got saved but anyway we moved into this old house and one night um on this side there are some rooms over here but on this side there was living room bedroom kitchen living room bedroom kitchen and so we went to go to bed that night tired and more out put the babies to bed and eddie turned over towards the kitchen i went to turn over towards him and i happened to look and there was the door from the living room to the bedroom there was a light on the door it was an old house the house was dark there was a strange light on the door now you don't heard me tell you how much of a scaredy cat i was but when you're tired and sleep you're probably more out you you just gotta go to sleep so i saw that light and i asked eddie i said what's that like he said i don't know and he tried to think i said no no we didn't know what it was it was unusual light he said it's a street light not in the street like three light lights a whole room and it wasn't doing that it was solid being so tired and sleepy i just turned over going back to sleep with him when i did i heard that light leave the door i was not a christian i described it like that and then i'll describe it like that now i don't don't make a lot of sense i don't know another way to describe it it was like an angel left that door and flew away right across the foot of our bed and slammed into the baby crib and shook the whole house i'm trying to turn and look at it i can hear it flying wow i can't move i can't speak i don't need to see what's going on scare the cat that i was i wanted to see it something was after me i wanted to see what it was after it sounded like he hit the crib shook the whole house i was able to move i was able to speak and the light was gone there was a present in the house not a good president a full woman it's hard to explain that presence but it was not a good presence they are two after that we both worked i worked on 12 o'clock i don't remember what time his hours were like i said we were drifting ships in the night but this particular night the factories everywhere was taking inventories they do that off and when they take inventory you don't work so i wasn't working he wasn't working because our factories were taking inventory so we sat on the couch that night and for the first time in a long time we were connected it felt good to be there together and every little bit whatever was watching on tv every little bit i'd go check on the babies make sure this house was cold old house make sure they're covered up not kick their covers off they were fine both of them were fine the tv went off back then about 11 11 30 12 o'clock i forget it didn't play all night like it does now we got ready to go to bed and uh went to bed uh checked on the babies and at least lisa would have been uh 20 months solid bleaches and something like that she was at the point of death that quick so we didn't have a car we didn't have a phone so eddie took off running to my sister's house and borrowed her car and he was back just it scared us it scared us she was right at the point of death within a matter of minutes he grabbed her up and he took her to the hospital and of course i couldn't go jimmy couldn't go so we i set up all night my own holding timmy now it's march now we don't have it here and i'm glad because it really bothers me they have what they call march wins and especially my own house i don't know about the new ones all night long real spooky real scary and i'm sitting up all night home holding that baby and that what's going on no way to contact me nothing and i don't know what in the world's going on and i'm scared and so i'm just sitting there holding the baby so the next day the next morning he'd come back and lisa had they called it the remembrance crew the hospital was full of they had to put her out in the hall they didn't have removed for and as soon as she got there they put her in the option in her medicine and she was in there for a week and she started coming back around uh by the next day she was playing a little bit but she still was sick and so uh he he come back and we took the baby he was three months old took him to my sister's house she was to keep him and i was to spend the day at the hospital with lisa and eddie had to go and i don't remember now what he had to do if he had to go to work or why but anyway that's what we did i went and spent the day at the hospital with lisa and my sister had timmy all day well that night you know we hadn't had no rest no sleep and that night i guess about 11 o'clock maybe 12. um my sister sent the baby back to me eddie's sister lina the oldest sister she was going to come and spend the night with lisa at the hospital and let me and eddie go home and get get some couple hours sleep we we were sleep deprived tired or more out so here they come and it was an old hospital it was not like it is today doctors didn't stay there like they do today so um we got there and my my sister said word i need to have the baby checked because he was creepy too this is what it did we took him into the er and had him checked out to make sure he's okay because his sister's in the hospital and so they said it was fine and that if i still worried about him bring him to the office in the morning okay that's what we'll do so then the plan was lena had to go to work in another town at seven o'clock the next morning we had her car we had the plan was we would be back to the hospital in time for her to get in her car and go to her job she had four boys to support so we went home got him something to eat got got the baby ready for bed and he had just really learned how to smile real cute and he was sound asleep and i said i wish he'd wake up give me that smile and he did he woke up and looked at me and smiled and you know right back to sleep so then we put him in the bed and um eddie crawled in the bed the front of the bed our bed was against the wall and the baby's crib was gosh that baby crib was that close to us at the foot of the bed and so i went to get in the bed behind him and when i did a stop okay what's wrong i don't know i'm worried he said what you worried about i don't know i'm just just worried maybe i shouldn't have left lisa he said well if you haven't been phyllis you'd worry about timmy well that's true i couldn't beat both of them so i crawled up in the bed and as soon as my head hit that bed i was gone well the next morning we overslept eddie jumped straight up jimmy bumper slept gene timmy's dead and i went to the crib and he was about the time i was saying i'm worried the angel of the lord was taken that's what that lock was on the door that turned our lives around he was guardian angel sent from brother brown said he's a minor savior he saved us twice he saved us from a fire and he saved our soul from a burning fire well i was so uh distraught they they give me a pill that put me to sleep and i don't i can't take stuff like that even today but i didn't know so they put me to sleep because i to calm me down and uh when i woke up they tried to give me another one this is no hope you're not going to get a second one in on me i got those pictures my mama had a baby sister named doris my indoors this was the house we lived in they they brought the the deceased to your house back then and my endorse took those pictures or i wouldn't have them i wouldn't have them and the one where he was smiling i and lisa in the hospital i took them the week before i wouldn't have had any pictures i took them the week before so anyway then the baptist preacher preacher keller a wonderful man wonderful family he come in he held the funeral and when he come in i lost it i want to go to heaven let me tell you kids we have a transgressor's heart don't think it's not it's very hard so i told the lord i'd go to church why wasn't i in church i had confessed to be a christian as a little girl what was going on well anyway we started a church badminton east first street baptist church whenever service eddie worked at night so he couldn't go through the week but we we went every service loved church and and one got saved he got safety turned our whole lives around the morning god saved and the lord started dealing with me about things that puzzled me i was a typical american girl i was just turned 21 years old uh that's my picture with my daddy and the picture with my mama that was in december i turned 21 in december so anyway he began dealing with me about wearing a pants i thought that's all because they wore pants he began dealing with me wearing makeup and i thought they weren't they got it puzzled me but i was still trying to do it so i okay i know what it is it's not my pants it's my shorts i got rid of all the shorts i still have my pants said that patient one time i said hey i don't wear pants no more the lord took them from me she said well you've got them on right now you know the lord knows how to cheat you might not want that was eddie's sister so and uh but anyway then um i only wore lipstick i don't want eye shadow okay that's what it is it says eye shadow i couldn't wear an eye shadow it still didn't leave me was a couple people in the church if i can express this right that i considered to be special i was never special but i sure wanted to be there was miss lighty she was the piano player she'd sit there and play and cry my heart would burst in first there was a young girl and her husband would get up behind the pulpit and sing and she would start crying and go clean down to the floor my heart would burst then i knew this girl from school and i seen her do that and i thought i don't get so bad there are special people in the world that seem like are higher than i just need more but what is the my oh god oh but i'm not special you got to be special about that time the lord was going through our family my sister jewell got saved at that time and she got saved in her kitchen you don't have to go to the altar i went to the altar because i wanted to be a christian and i thought you had to go to the altar to be a christian because every every service they had an altar call and so i i couldn't get the nerve up to go so finally i got the nerve up to go and i run to that altar and got down and some of the women come and prayed with me and i didn't pray i didn't pray because i didn't know what to pray i didn't know what to say i just let them pray and then when they stood up and stood me up i saw that's why caleb's when i saw caleb campbell give his life to the lord that brought back a lot of memories he saw he saw i did too i think i outright him but all them years of that deep ache they grieved that total despair in one second it was wow and in his place was a tender hallelujah delicate peaceful feeling i've never had in my life i really got saved because i really you know i know a lot of people they start out when you go we have a transgressors hard when i went i'm in business i wanted to be a christian period i've never never desired anything different i know some people have you know their struggles i never didn't have that struggle thanks to god but i come a lot of people have come a lot harder but no one has come in more depth of grief and sorrow and discouragement and suicidal than i did and god delivered me but i wanted more i didn't know there was more my sister margaret the oldest of our sisters bless her heart she's in glory she also gave her life to the lord at the same time in margaret jewel all around the same time and she felt like me she she wanted more but she didn't know she said mama i always said if i was going to be a christian i wanted to be in a special that's one word i could think special well her neighbor a little message church probably 40 people more or less moved into our team about a year or so before and her neighbor went to it and she invited margaret to go with her to church and margaret went she went to the altar again when she come back she glowed she absolutely blew she would come to her house and she said i know when i die i'm going to heaven well now i'm a christian now but i told eddie i said i don't know when i die i'm going to heaven i couldn't say that like she could so she invited me to go i finally was able to go with her unbeknownst to me my 15 year old sister connie had already went a couple times i didn't know that so that particular night i know the first time i walked into a message church now they were message believers um but they were out of pentecost so still a lot of things haven't been put in order you're talking 1962. and so uh anyway um trying to think where i was at so when i walked into that church you could have knocked me with a failure i was astounded everybody in that church was special they were all worshipping god oh oh god that's what i don't know that and so the preacher because that's kind of what he did within uh we were sitting up towards and the preacher come out there after preaching and laid hands on connie connie started shouting and screaming i was i was beyond i can't that's my sister she's special i don't know what she's got but it's one of my hearts voting for i run to the office nobody had to take me when i got up there the preacher wanted me i didn't know there was such a thing as a holy ghost i said i wanted to i wonder what he did with her he prayed for me nothing happened see i expected to do like the rest of them if i was special i'm gonna do like them doesn't happen church service come up again since church was over anybody by now i'm

i didn't i didn't realize anybody was around me other than i knew the preacher was preaching and before me was a scene just as plain as i'm looking at y'all and in that scene there were two figures walking arm and arm looked like a little narrow street dressed in white robes well the one on the left looked like was carrying some kind of a wand a candlestick or something and a blazing fire on the end of it what is that well it wasn't in focus and then the one on the left become in focus and it was me dressed in a white robe and i was the one with in wow you know what that means i didn't then but i didn't know then the other one on the right leading me come into focus and it was the lord jesus i didn't see him front ways i saw them at an angle like uh you saw the walks with me it's kind of like that now i'm caught up in that i didn't know what was going on i didn't know about visions and all i had i'm just brand new in that church so after church we went downstairs to get baptized and

um so i dripping wet cold freeze and step back towards the corner and the veggie was her time now she walked up the steps walked down the steps she got baptized she liked toward that pool apart apartment she jumped cleaned out of that baptism i pulled on my cement floor and they had a time everybody but me i'm standing in the corner dripping wet broken hearted that's what i want i wasn't special i just wasn't and this wasn't special i want to tell you kids you're all special every one of you special i didn't know it i'm special too but i didn't know what i thought i just knew i wanted it sunday night went back to church anybody with the holy ghost and this time the pastor got pretty wore outward he called upon the church everybody in that little church come up praying they were best i was desperate i could feel hands all of them show how we do everything one hand particularly stood out to me and that hand kind of vibrated and it was on the small of my back and it was vibrating and it stood out to me and out of all those hands all up down my shoulders and everything i had vibration and then that vibration went to my body and my whole body was vibrating did i shout yes i did i shouted i screamed i'm in the message today because of that seek after the holy ghost it is real it will keep you you are special i was special i guess god let me go through that just so i could tell it to all y'all so now all you all your kids your seniors and if pennies live i have i have something here for you if you all come and get it good first go you nice sign your name mason and this is your peach steak forever okay just say your name on the front of the book so don't nobody get it y'all come on everybody i brought you all one this is the baptism of the holy ghost you are special that's why you must have the holy ghost you've all heard it now you heard my testimony a portion of it we'd be here this time next week if i code it off thank you sure god bless god bless you jackson put your names on it so don't everybody take your book avery now if we don't have enough rachel has ordered some they're not here yet and um that this is it the rest of you there will be some more as soon as rachel gets them in okay that's all i had i think that was about 19 and so thank y'all for coming it's been an honors pleasure to add my testimony how god saved me y'all have got some wonderful testimonies i've heard most of them maybe all of them and i have served i just wanted to add money to god bless you amen [Applause] i have to make a confession here i probably at least fifty percent of that i was hearing for the first time wow well how i never know i knew generally i went but there was so much at least so i'm sure you enjoyed it i know it was a great blessing to me amen if you enjoyed it let sister gene see your hand go along there's more all over i just hope it inspires us all more and more we're all inspired always a little bit more inspired we're all special y'all are all special it feels pretty bad when you think you're not special when you find out you're special it's it's wonderful predestination amen amen praise the lord i know how that feels must get annoyed at trying to stop [Applause] it's all good amen so uh she's the clean mother of the church so we're happy happy to have this gene with us and it's special for me let's all stand back to our feet you know i i it's amazing when you think about how the hand of god leads lives and generations hope i mean now here we are today and you know probably a a good quarter of this church well there's i don't know it's probably not that many but at least there's uh 15 or so of us i think um something like that i think when we get together we're like 15 strong or something like that something that that number and that's all because of the stories that we have just now god dealing with a little girl who even though she didn't go to church i mean that should speak about the gene of god that begins to cry out even from a child because here she is going up a dirt road 10 year old girl praying to wedding singing contest and she wanted hey man sister jane actually used to sing on the radio which is a little girl she sunk so good they had her singing she was part of the the church service they would have live broadcast she'd go there and help the preacher by singing amen so we're loving hearing that amen and i i'm i'm looking forward to the day when all of you all are able to hear a young 20 year old sister gene again amen and so she still sings to me so beautiful but i remember how she sounded also as a young woman and closest sound of running water you ever want to hear just a beautiful soprano voice and uh sung at brother brown's tabernacle for years with his daughter rebecca and sister hannah graham and so i tell you what i i believe and i i i who will second this motion sister for this testimony that we've heard lord it is inspiring it is inspiring lord to have these young people hear an eyewitness lord of your love and how that you begin dealing with someone as a small child and you guide their life and you watch over them you keep your hand upon them sorrow sadness tragedy sure these are the things of life that mold our characters we come through them i'm glad lord that you preserved her i'm glad this whole church is glad that you preserved her lord and wouldn't let the enemy tried to take her down a dark road wouldn't let him wouldn't let him have a victory in that board today we are the beneficiaries of your grace and sister gene's life i thank you for it lord we now i want to commit these young people their hearts now father while this is on their hearts i pray that they will speak to you lord in in very real and very meaningful ways master and that you will show them also of the great plans that you have for their life now i committed to you lord and on that other side lord there will no doubt be some who'll come up and say sister gina was in that live service and i'm hearing glory today because of your testimony or maybe they'll hear it on the recording they'll hear it on a recorded art pattern and they'll say from that day i purposed in my heart i made up my mind i want to take that path as well so lord we thank you for that a life well-lived a life rich rich in love and grace and peace father i committed now all of these things into your hands in jesus name and i just want to encourage you all while you know this testimony is fresh on your heart read that book sister gene took the time to get it for you it's her gift to you this what you're going to read in this book is the thing that changed her life amen and there was two or three i think at the end of the line didn't get one so we'll get you some yeah rachel's got it all right you know amen so it's mom that talk the church where the whole church came up to pray for you was that that same little church there that i went to as a teenager no that was the brick church no it was there on main street it was an old cafe okay and i don't have a picture of it okay so i never went to the church no well yeah you did and as a little tiny baby okay praise the lord so y'all heard what y'all heard was why they they called me the holy ghost baby because i was like john the baptist amen praise the lord i was the reason i was asking is because it was in a it was another church that when we came back to north carolina from living in jeffersonville for seven years and it was in that little church where i was healed of this terrible back injury i'd actually broke the base of my spine and couldn't hardly stand up straight or walk straight and i was probably 14 maybe some 15 14. yeah i looked right right right under my legs and uh i ended up cracking the vertebrae in my spine and so uh i was went up for prayer and i had the same exact experience preachers gathered in front of me and someone stepped up behind me and put a hand on the small of my back and after service and i was healed instantly immediately right then and there and i asked my mom later i said hey who walked up behind me i said no i mean coming up to pray for me who came up and stood by and put their hand on my back she said there was no one a hand in my back and that was amen so i'm a witness also the love of god praise the lord it's been wonderful thank you all for coming to say god bless you you can be dismissed god bless you you you
