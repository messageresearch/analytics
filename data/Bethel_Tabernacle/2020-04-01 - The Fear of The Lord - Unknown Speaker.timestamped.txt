[40:23] let's go to 2nd Kings chapter 6 I have
[40:26] to turn e 2nd Kings chapter 6 and we
[40:31] just want to begin reading here amen
[40:34] praise the Lord I don't have any
[40:37] PowerPoint today so we we just have a
[40:40] lot of scriptures so brother Joe or
[40:42] whoever we have amen that's the fastest
[40:45] on that on that machine you're gonna
[40:47] need to be real quick today because
[40:49] though we got we got quite a few to get
[40:51] to amen just the way the Lord dealt with
[40:53] my heart and I'd like to just speak to
[40:55] you here tonight on the fear of the Lord
[40:58] the fear of the Lord
[41:00] 2nd Kings chapter 6 and let's go ahead
[41:02] and look here and then we'll look let me
[41:07] just find where I want to begin verse 9
[41:09] and the man of God sent in to the king
[41:12] of Israel saying beware that thou pass
[41:15] not such a place for thither the Syrians
[41:17] are come down and the king of Israel
[41:19] sent to the place which the man of God
[41:21] told him and warned David to himself
[41:23] there not once nor twice therefore the
[41:27] heart of the king of Syria was sore
[41:29] troubled for this thing and he called
[41:31] his servants and said unto them will you
[41:33] not show me which of us is for the king
[41:36] of Israel and one of his servants said
[41:38] none my lord o king but Elisha the
[41:42] Prophet that is in Israel tell us the
[41:45] king of Israel the words that thou
[41:47] speakest in thy bedchamber and he said
[41:50] go and spy where he is that I may fetch
[41:53] him that I may that I may send and fetch
[41:55] him and it was told him saying behold he
[41:58] is in Dothan therefore sent he threw
[42:00] their horses and chariots and a great
[42:03] host and they came by night and
[42:04] compassed the cities about
[42:07] and when the servant of the man of God
[42:09] was risen early and going forth behold a
[42:12] host compassed the city both with
[42:15] chariots both with horses and chariots
[42:17] and his servant said unto Him alas my
[42:21] master how shall we do and he answered
[42:24] fear not for they that be with us are
[42:28] more than they that be with them and
[42:31] Elijah prayed and said Lord I pray thee
[42:34] open his eyes that he may see and the
[42:37] Lord opened the eyes of the young man
[42:39] and he saw and behold the mountains was
[42:43] full of horses and chariots of fire
[42:45] round about Elijah and when they came
[42:48] down to Hill meal I she prayed unto the
[42:50] Lord and said smite this people I pray
[42:52] thee with blindness and they smote them
[42:54] with blindness according to the word of
[42:56] Elijah one more scripture scripture
[42:59] proverbs chapter 9 and verse 10 its
[43:02] proverbs chapter 9 and verse 10 give you
[43:05] just a second to get there mm-hmm very
[43:09] familiar Scripture but we thought just
[43:11] for our context here tonight it would be
[43:13] important to read it proverbs chapter
[43:15] proverbs chapter 9 verse 10 the fear of
[43:18] the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and
[43:22] the knowledge of the holy is
[43:25] understanding Lord Jesus we just bow our
[43:27] heads here before you Lord as your
[43:29] humble servant father I pray Lord we've
[43:32] we've worshipped you in our homes in
[43:34] this church no doubt Lord across the
[43:36] airwaves as I speak tonight many in
[43:38] different locations in different places
[43:40] Lord but your prophet told us distance
[43:43] doesn't mean a thing to you Lord it
[43:45] doesn't matter father he said that some
[43:47] of his greatest victory some of his
[43:49] greatest success was actually over a
[43:51] telephone praying for somebody Lord
[43:54] because distance doesn't mean anything
[43:56] to you Lord it doesn't physical the Holy
[43:58] Spirit doesn't matter the physical
[44:00] proximity we are to each other
[44:02] Lord wherever two or three are gathered
[44:04] in your name there you'll be in their
[44:06] midst so lord I pray right now father
[44:08] that you would go on the wings of this
[44:10] prayer may your spirit Lord touch every
[44:13] life that will hear this sermon here
[44:15] tonight whether it's recorded Lord or
[44:17] here live bless it now we ask in Jesus
[44:19] Christ's name
[44:20] amen you can be seated thank you
[44:22] musicians an amazing story here that we
[44:25] find in second Kings chapter six and the
[44:28] Bible speaks here and we're gonna we're
[44:30] gonna refer back to this here in just a
[44:32] moment but I just want to bring the
[44:34] context out of this as the Lord has just
[44:37] led me in this direction
[44:38] Benna dad was the king of a country car
[44:41] the the country of Syria and the Bible
[44:44] says that he had declared a war against
[44:47] Israel and the scripture says that he
[44:50] had gathered all of his generals in his
[44:52] armies and he was going to attack Israel
[44:55] and the scripture says that he gathered
[44:57] them in his strategy room and he began
[44:59] to lay out a strategy and a plan of
[45:01] attack and the scripture says that two
[45:04] on two different times that after his
[45:06] Syria would go and invade and try to
[45:08] attack that it just seemed like that
[45:10] Israel was always one step ahead of him
[45:13] they always knew what was gonna come
[45:15] before it came they always was receiving
[45:18] warning before judgment and he couldn't
[45:21] figure this out and he said ah I don't
[45:23] know what's happening and and so he
[45:25] gathers all of his men and he says which
[45:27] one of you is a spy for Israel and which
[45:30] one of you is a traitor and they said
[45:32] none my lord there's none of us or a
[45:34] traitor but there's actually a man named
[45:36] Elijah who's a prophet and he hears the
[45:39] words that you speak in your bedchamber
[45:42] friend do you realize the ability of a
[45:45] prophet a seer God sent us a prophet in
[45:48] this generation and that prophet exposed
[45:51] the tactics and the strategies of the
[45:53] devil that's why the Bible that's why
[45:56] brother Brandon said Satan above
[45:57] everything hates the revelation of the
[45:59] Word of God but we love it because it
[46:02] exposes the strategy of Satan let me
[46:05] tell you God has not been taken by off
[46:07] guard he's not caught by surprise by
[46:10] anything that's happened in our world
[46:11] today nothing God is not shocked he is
[46:14] not alerted but he already knew it
[46:17] before it would come and my brother my
[46:19] sister we shouldn't be alarmed we
[46:21] shouldn't be surprised we should have a
[46:23] shalom arrest knowing that before the
[46:26] devil ever strategizes a plan to afflict
[46:30] or to attack God has already exposed him
[46:34] says show me the trader none my lord
[46:36] there's no trader here but there's a
[46:38] prophet in Israel and and so now that he
[46:41] knows this the scripture says that Benna
[46:44] dad says go and fetch him seek him and
[46:46] fetch him and so he you know go to
[46:48] Dothan him and find him and so he
[46:51] dispatches horses and the Bible says
[46:54] horses and chariots and they go to
[46:56] attack to try to capture Elijah I'm just
[46:59] gonna take this jacket off here they go
[47:02] to try to capture this prophet the seer
[47:06] who's exposing all of his plans and the
[47:09] scripture says he says go to go to
[47:10] Dothan and and and capture him and and
[47:13] so the Bible says that they go in the
[47:15] night and then the cover of darkness and
[47:18] they they surround the city and the
[47:21] scripture says that Elijah away Elijah a
[47:24] servant woke up you know what they were
[47:27] trying to do is they were trying to take
[47:29] you light ship by surprise take him off
[47:30] guard but the Bible says that that they
[47:33] surround him and Elijah serve it woke up
[47:36] early in the morning and he sold that
[47:38] the scripture says a host which means a
[47:41] mighty army had surrounded all of is all
[47:44] of all of Israel and the scripture says
[47:47] he runs to Elisha the prophet him and
[47:49] he's terrified he's in panic he's and
[47:52] fairies and pandemonium and and he says
[47:54] alas my master what shall we do we are
[47:58] surrounded this was his words we are
[48:00] surrounded and you know confident there
[48:03] was a confidence that he likes you had
[48:05] he wasn't worried he wasn't stirred he
[48:07] wasn't in panic he just looked at his
[48:10] servant and he said fear not pick it up
[48:13] here in verse and look at 2nd Kings
[48:15] chapter 6 brother Joe and and look here
[48:17] he says fear not for they that be with
[48:20] us are more than they that be with them
[48:24] I should pray notice and said Lord open
[48:28] his eyes that he may see and the Lord
[48:31] opened his the eyes of the young man and
[48:33] he saw and behold the mountains was full
[48:36] of horses and chariots of fire not out
[48:40] in front not behind but surrounding him
[48:45] when the devil thinks he's got you
[48:47] surrounded
[48:48] God has got you surrounded by an army of
[48:50] angels and chariots says that he's
[48:52] surrounded with chariots of fire round
[48:55] about Elisha you know this was something
[48:57] that David could say a David had such an
[49:00] assurance when he Lysa would say fear
[49:03] not it was with confidence there was an
[49:05] assurance because Elijah had peered into
[49:08] the dimension he had peered into another
[49:10] dimension you notice it wasn't it wasn't
[49:13] he wasn't telling Elijah or the servant
[49:15] you know to open his eyes to look
[49:17] physically because when he looked around
[49:19] him physically around the world it
[49:21] looked like pandemonium it looked like
[49:23] he was surrounded it looked chaotic but
[49:26] he said open his eyes in other words let
[49:29] him look into another dimension let him
[49:32] realize that this battle that we face is
[49:34] not a flesh and blood battle you know
[49:36] they've labeled this coronavirus kovin
[49:38] 19 they've given it a name but the
[49:41] prophet of God told us and said that
[49:43] that that those are just scientific
[49:45] medical terms they give but what we
[49:48] understand is that it's a demon spirit
[49:50] out of the fourth dimension it's a
[49:52] satanic assault we don't fear we don't
[49:56] fight flesh and blood we fight
[49:58] principalities spiritual warfare
[50:00] spiritual wickedness in other in another
[50:03] dimension and so Elijah's not saying I
[50:05] want you to I want you to open his eyes
[50:08] naturally but he's saying open his eyes
[50:11] give him this confidence open his eyes
[50:13] into another dimension and let him
[50:16] realize that while there may be demons
[50:18] there's also angels while there may be a
[50:20] devil there's also a God who's still on
[50:23] the throne and who still has authority
[50:26] and power in this generation Elisha
[50:29] David could have the same exact type of
[50:31] confidence david says in psalms chapter
[50:34] 3 verse 6 he says i will not be afraid
[50:38] of ten thousands of people that have set
[50:42] themselves against me we're gonna need
[50:44] to be fast here I'm gonna just go
[50:45] through these like a blaze he says I
[50:48] will not be afraid of ten thousands of
[50:50] people that have set themselves against
[50:53] me round a bow this is the confidence of
[50:56] the psalmist I'm not going to be afraid
[50:58] I don't fear like the world fear
[51:01] though and notice what he says in Psalms
[51:04] 27 verse 3 he says though a host should
[51:08] encamp against me a host meaning an army
[51:11] he says though a host should encamp
[51:13] against me my heart shall not fear the
[51:17] war should rise against me and this will
[51:20] I be confident Psalms 55 verse 18 he
[51:24] says he hath delivered my soul in peace
[51:28] from the battle that was against me for
[51:31] there were many with me Psalms 55 18 he
[51:36] hath delivered my soul not my body your
[51:39] subject to fear in this fallen flesh but
[51:42] in the midst of that fear God can
[51:44] deliver your soul in peace and you can
[51:47] have a peace that passes understanding
[51:48] and he says he's delivered my soul how
[51:51] because there were many with me he's
[51:53] speaking of an angelic host I say here
[51:55] tonight is a preach to you and maybe
[51:58] this would be your desire in your prayer
[51:59] Lord in the midst of all this chaos in
[52:02] this panic open my eyes Lord that I can
[52:05] see and behold that in another dimension
[52:07] while there may be spirits I object
[52:10] neither make spirits assaulting and
[52:13] invading the world there's an angelic
[52:15] army of angels to those who fear the
[52:18] name of the Lord you know the Old
[52:20] Testament Saints knew God in this
[52:22] special way in the end and then the
[52:24] Bible says that you know that we know
[52:26] him as what is we know him as Savior we
[52:28] know him as Lord we know him as son of
[52:30] man we know him as the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:33] but you'll notice there's a term in the
[52:36] Old Testament that you find all the way
[52:38] from the book of Samuel all the way to
[52:40] the book of Malachi God is referred to
[52:43] over 200 times as the Lord of hosts Lord
[52:49] of hosts will pick up just a few of
[52:52] these in Psalms 46
[52:54] 7 the Lord of Hosts is with us the God
[52:58] of Jacob is our refuge and sums 89 verse
[53:02] 8 Oh Lord God of hosts who is strong who
[53:09] is a strong tower like unto thee or to
[53:11] they or to thy faithfulness round
[53:14] about Lee that was some 89 8 and somes
[53:18] 84 8 he says Lord God of hosts hear my
[53:24] prayer these are just a few of these
[53:25] David would refer to him as the Lord God
[53:29] of hosts in Psalms 24 and verse 10 David
[53:34] says the Lord of hosts he is the king of
[53:37] glory so they understood him by as this
[53:41] name the Lord of hosts the scripture
[53:46] says that David would wax great and
[53:48] greater and greater in battle because
[53:50] the Lord this is the verse because for
[53:52] the Lord was with him he was he was with
[53:56] him in a specific attribute of his
[53:58] character and that attribute was the
[54:00] Lord of Hosts or the Lord who surrounds
[54:06] the Hebrew word for host and I don't
[54:09] know Hebrew so I'm probably going to
[54:11] pronounce this with some good southern
[54:13] English understanding but the Lord of
[54:16] Hosts this word host is spelled TSB aah
[54:19] oh you could pronounce it BA the Lord of
[54:22] hosts and I only say that because their
[54:24] significance in the meaning of this name
[54:27] the Lord of hosts it means an army an
[54:31] army that's important right they're an
[54:33] army
[54:34] ready and poised for battle
[54:37] an army ready and poised not now think
[54:41] of this definition when David would say
[54:43] Oh Lord God of hosts he would say the
[54:47] Lord God of hosts is with us not a
[54:52] singular but an army ready and poised
[54:55] for battle
[54:56] it means soldiers horses chariots army
[55:01] ready at any moment to do war for the
[55:04] Lord
[55:05] an army assembled and waiting for
[55:09] instructions this is how Elisha had
[55:13] could have confidence because he knew
[55:15] the Lord of Hosts this is how David
[55:18] could have confidence because he knew
[55:21] the Lord of Hosts yareta in Hezekiah and
[55:25] this is Hezekiah who is king of Judah
[55:28] you can read over in the book of second
[55:29] chronicles and the scripture speaks here
[55:31] we can turn there if you want and second
[55:33] chronicles chapter 32 brother Joe if you
[55:36] could pull that up Hezekiah was when he
[55:39] was surrounded very much like Elijah he
[55:41] was surrounded by an Assyrian army an
[55:44] army much greater in Sun size and a
[55:47] number and the Bible says that Hezekiah
[55:49] was surrounded by the Assyrians and
[55:52] second chronicles 32 verse 7 notice what
[55:55] he says here this is the words from
[55:57] Hezekiah hey wait for you to have it
[55:59] Jones is too good second chronicles
[56:01] chapter 30 scepter 32 verse 7 second
[56:06] chronicles there we go thank you he says
[56:08] be strong and courageous be not afraid
[56:12] nor dismay now this was mentioned by
[56:17] Hezekiah it was mentioned by David it
[56:19] was mentioned by Elisha but it was
[56:22] actually they were only repeating they
[56:25] didn't think of this it wasn't a sudden
[56:26] thought David wasn't repeating the words
[56:29] of Elijah
[56:29] they weren't repeating the words of each
[56:31] other but this was actually a command
[56:33] that God had given to the children of
[56:35] Israel under Moses and he said this was
[56:39] a command it wasn't a suggestion it
[56:41] wasn't some good advice this was
[56:44] actually a command that the Lord gave
[56:46] him and said don't fear don't be afraid
[56:52] it was a command don't be afraid jesus
[56:56] said the same thing in matthew 10 he
[56:58] said don't fear Him who can destroy the
[57:01] body but fear Him who can't read both
[57:03] the body and soul this was a command
[57:06] that he was giving them don't fear
[57:09] that's what David would repeat it fear
[57:11] not that's why I see as soon as he's
[57:13] seen a server who was panicked and in
[57:15] chaos he likes you immediately the first
[57:17] words he doesn't say calm down he
[57:19] doesn't say hold on a minute
[57:21] he doesn't say what's happening he says
[57:23] fear not that'll always drive the spirit
[57:28] of fear out of your life fear not notice
[57:32] what he says should be strong and
[57:34] courageous be not afraid
[57:36] door nor dismayed for the king of
[57:39] Assyria nor for all notice
[57:41] this nor for all the multitude that is
[57:45] with him for there be more with us than
[57:49] with him now here's an important part
[57:51] with him is an arm of flesh but with us
[57:56] is the Lord our God to help us and to
[58:03] fight our battles what a promise don't
[58:09] be afraid with film as an arm of flesh
[58:12] with helm as an arm of flesh but with us
[58:14] is the Lord is what with us as chariots
[58:18] no with us as an as a vaccine no with us
[58:22] is with us as some army some great
[58:24] trained fighters no but here's what we
[58:27] do have the Lord of Hosts the Lord
[58:32] mighty in battle he says here know the
[58:36] Old Testament noticed this this was a
[58:38] rest and I noticed what it says here he
[58:40] says the king of Judah verse 9 brother
[58:42] Joe he says a little meeting I'm sorry
[58:44] go back I'm sorry verse 8 notice this he
[58:47] says with him is an arm of flesh but
[58:50] with us is the Lord our God to help us
[58:53] and to fight our battles and the people
[58:56] rested themselves upon the words of
[58:59] Hezekiah the king of Judah what did we
[59:02] receive in this generation it wasn't
[59:04] some doctrine or some good ideas or some
[59:06] theology but we received Shalom rest
[59:10] little bride and we can have rest in the
[59:13] midst of calamity we can have peace to
[59:16] our delivered to our soul doesn't mean
[59:20] that you're not listen my brother my
[59:21] sister yeah it doesn't mean that you're
[59:23] not you can't you're always susceptible
[59:26] to be afraid that's part of your fallen
[59:27] nature but God is saying don't fear fear
[59:31] not fear them not for the Lord of Hosts
[59:33] is with us then you notice they would
[59:36] rest upon the words they would rest upon
[59:40] this vision because they couldn't see it
[59:43] with her eyes I want you to catch this
[59:45] here today they couldn't see it
[59:47] physically and you can't see an army of
[59:49] angels physically but they rested on the
[59:52] Asian that the word was giving them this
[59:55] word projects a vision to you you don't
[59:58] ever have to see with your eyes or touch
[1:00:00] it with your hands but it's pretend
[1:00:01] projecting a vision and their rest was
[1:00:04] upon the vision that the word created in
[1:00:07] their spirit and they would rest upon
[1:00:10] this Lord of Hosts the Lord you know
[1:00:14] what that means it means the god of
[1:00:16] Angel armies the god of angelic armies
[1:00:21] and notice here they would rest upon
[1:00:24] these it was an unseen but it was a
[1:00:27] prepared and poised for battle for their
[1:00:30] protection and sums 121 and verse 5
[1:00:35] David would boast and notice what he
[1:00:38] says here in Psalms chapter 121 brother
[1:00:40] Joe versus private I'm gonna wait for
[1:00:42] you to pull it up Psalms 1 21 verse 5 he
[1:00:47] says here the chariots of God notice the
[1:00:52] chariots of God sums 1 21 verse 5 this
[1:00:59] is really good oh it's too too good just
[1:01:01] to miss Psalms 121 if you have a Bible
[1:01:05] that'd be good you could you could use
[1:01:06] that notice the chariots of God psalms
[1:01:10] 121 I got that wrong I'd I have it Psalm
[1:01:13] 68 17 I'm sorry Joe I had my next one so
[1:01:16] get that one ready also listen to this
[1:01:18] sums shout psalms psalms chapter 68
[1:01:23] verse 17 Psalm 68 and notice good notice
[1:01:28] the chariots of God this was the vision
[1:01:30] of the Almighty the chariots of God are
[1:01:34] 20,000 even thousands of angels son army
[1:01:40] even thousands of angels and the Lord
[1:01:44] this is the best part is among him and
[1:01:48] the Lord is among them who is the Lord
[1:01:51] he's the same one who appeared to Joshua
[1:01:53] he said are you forced to fry adversary
[1:01:56] said neither I'm the captain of the
[1:01:58] Lord's host I'm the general of the army
[1:02:00] the Lord is among him
[1:02:04] notice what he says here he says he says
[1:02:06] there 20,000 Lord is among them
[1:02:07] now Psalms chapter 20 21 verse 5 brother
[1:02:10] Joe Psalms 1 21 and verse 5 notice what
[1:02:14] he says here he says he says the Lord is
[1:02:18] thy keeper the Lord is thy shade upon
[1:02:22] thy right hand the Lord is thy keeper
[1:02:28] this is really important here Peter
[1:02:30] would use the same exact word and and in
[1:02:33] 1st Peter chapter 1 and verse 5 Peter
[1:02:36] would say in PA first Peter 1 in chapter
[1:02:39] 5 a virtue first Peter chapter 1 verse 5
[1:02:42] he says we are kept by the power of God
[1:02:46] through faith unto salvation we are kept
[1:02:51] this is the same word that David uses
[1:02:52] and said the Lord is thy keeper
[1:02:55] he's thy shade upon thy right hand this
[1:02:58] is first Peter he says he says here we
[1:03:01] are kept by the power of God through
[1:03:05] faith unto saving unto salvation unto
[1:03:11] salvation ready to be posed are you with
[1:03:16] me an army waiting ready for battle we
[1:03:20] are kept by the power of God through
[1:03:22] faith unto salvation ready to be
[1:03:24] revealed in the last time that's a
[1:03:27] prophecy for right now you see last time
[1:03:30] you say right now I notice what he says
[1:03:34] here even Jesus and in John 17 turned
[1:03:37] there and John 17 verse 12 Jesus would
[1:03:40] use the same word here and he would say
[1:03:43] father he begin to pray this and he says
[1:03:45] in John 17 verse 12 he says when I was
[1:03:47] with him I kept them there's that
[1:03:51] keeping power when I was with while I
[1:03:54] was with him in the world I kept them in
[1:03:58] thy name when I was with them I kept
[1:04:04] them in thy name those who thou has
[1:04:08] given me I have kept and none of them is
[1:04:12] lost none of them is lost so the Bible
[1:04:17] doesn't say that
[1:04:18] sciples were keeping themselves when
[1:04:20] they were even with Jesus they're in
[1:04:21] flesh but Jesus says I've been keeping
[1:04:25] them I've been protecting them I've been
[1:04:29] keeping them they didn't you better not
[1:04:31] be keeping yourself in this generation
[1:04:33] but you better be kept by the power of
[1:04:35] God ready to be revealed in the last
[1:04:37] days they're kept by what by an angelic
[1:04:41] army else they are kept by something
[1:04:44] outside of themselves they couldn't have
[1:04:47] made it one single day without this
[1:04:49] promise while I was in the world those
[1:04:51] whom thou give us me I have kept and not
[1:04:54] one of them is lost what a prayer he
[1:04:57] says in in verse 15 he says I pray not
[1:05:00] that thou should take vil notice this
[1:05:03] year I pray not that thou should has
[1:05:06] take them out of the world why Jesus we
[1:05:10] can all say Lord just rapture us right
[1:05:13] now Lord just take us home right now why
[1:05:16] do we even got to go through this Jesus
[1:05:18] says huh you got a purpose here I know
[1:05:21] I'm not gonna pray that that I take you
[1:05:23] out of the world but here's what I'm
[1:05:25] gonna pray he says I'm not gonna pray
[1:05:28] not that thou should take them out of
[1:05:29] the world but that thou should ask EEP
[1:05:32] guard protect surround surround them
[1:05:37] from the evil
[1:05:38] you know evil as evil as a part of
[1:05:42] prophecy in the Bible we know that the
[1:05:45] world is unraveling that's what we're
[1:05:47] seeing here today we're seeing a runnin
[1:05:48] raveling a complete and total unraveling
[1:05:51] of the entire world systems even Jesus
[1:05:54] would predict this in Luke chapter 21
[1:05:56] verse 25 Jesus would predict this and
[1:05:59] say that that that the last day the end
[1:06:02] times would be a day of unprecedented
[1:06:05] fear in fact it would be said the fear
[1:06:08] you think the people are afraid right
[1:06:09] now and in panic right now jesus said
[1:06:12] the fear would become so potent that
[1:06:15] their heart would stop from fear he says
[1:06:19] in Luke 21 verse 25 brother Joe he says
[1:06:22] that there would be an age of
[1:06:24] unprecedented fear notice what he says
[1:06:26] here he says upon the earth distress of
[1:06:29] nations distress
[1:06:31] with perplexity men distress perplexity
[1:06:35] would be too good words to describe the
[1:06:37] looks upon the
[1:06:42] conference distress and perplexed the
[1:06:47] sea in the waves Rory noticed this is a
[1:06:49] period of a prophecy of the tribulation
[1:06:50] here men's hearts failing them for fear
[1:06:53] and for looking after those things which
[1:06:57] are coming on the earth for the power of
[1:07:00] heaven shall be shaken right Matthew 24
[1:07:04] he answers three different questions but
[1:07:06] when he answers not that when he answers
[1:07:08] the question there he gives warnings
[1:07:10] also of what would happen and what would
[1:07:12] come what will be the sign of that
[1:07:14] coming water will be the end of the age
[1:07:16] and Jesus answers the question and he
[1:07:20] says nation will rise against nation
[1:07:21] Kingdom against Kingdom there shall be
[1:07:23] famines and pestilences and earthquakes
[1:07:25] and then he says all these are the
[1:07:28] beginning of Sorrows now the brides
[1:07:31] raptured right before that verse before
[1:07:34] the beginning of Sorrows or gone praise
[1:07:38] God men shall betray one another they
[1:07:41] shall hate one another false prophets
[1:07:43] are gonna rise deceiving many we know
[1:07:46] that was false anointed ones
[1:07:47] Jesus says iniquity is going to abound
[1:07:50] then he says he says that the love of
[1:07:52] many is going to wax or grow cold this
[1:07:56] was all prophecies then shall be Great
[1:07:59] Tribulation such as never eyes nor shall
[1:08:04] ever be for there there shall arise
[1:08:07] false Christ's and false prophets and
[1:08:09] shall show great signs and wonders watch
[1:08:11] notice watch therefore for you know not
[1:08:15] what hour your Lord doth come what
[1:08:20] you're seeing today in the entire world
[1:08:22] is a state of of no matter whether it's
[1:08:26] believers or unbelievers or saved or
[1:08:28] unsaved you're seeing the entire world
[1:08:30] witness the birth pains the contractions
[1:08:35] of tribulation I heard a you know the
[1:08:39] brother who wrote the poem there and for
[1:08:42] the mother from Africa said it's this is
[1:08:43] welcome to the dress rehearsal what a
[1:08:45] fitting way to describe what's happening
[1:08:47] right now heard another brother had
[1:08:49] preached it and he said it's he said
[1:08:50] it's like a what you're witnessing today
[1:08:53] said it's a precursor it's
[1:08:55] they said it's like a you ever watched a
[1:08:57] storm off in the distance and he says
[1:08:59] and you could see you're not in the
[1:09:01] store maybe it's still sunshine where
[1:09:02] you're at but he says you see the
[1:09:04] darkness the clouds get darker and
[1:09:06] darker as they gather he said you can
[1:09:08] even start to hear the Thunder in the
[1:09:11] distance and he said you can see the
[1:09:14] lightning even begin to strike though
[1:09:16] it's not there he said this is what do
[1:09:17] you want to know what this cove at 19
[1:09:19] it's the brewing of the tribulation it's
[1:09:23] the coming that's not here yet but it's
[1:09:25] brewing these aren't tribulation or
[1:09:27] plagues because I'm still here and
[1:09:29] you're still here but it's the brewing
[1:09:33] of a storm it's a learning before
[1:09:36] judgment and the entire world is in
[1:09:41] panic and they're in fear and they're in
[1:09:43] perplexity and if you're not careful my
[1:09:46] brother my sister you may not have
[1:09:48] coronavirus you may not get coronavirus
[1:09:50] you you may not be in panic and buying
[1:09:52] toilet paper and paper towels and you
[1:09:54] may not be doing any of that but if
[1:09:57] you're not careful you can ingest the
[1:10:01] atmosphere of fear just by turning on
[1:10:03] your television if you're not careful
[1:10:06] just by taking in so much always looking
[1:10:08] for what's on the news and what's
[1:10:10] happening now on and and aunt Lee in
[1:10:12] answer I am guilty as well watching
[1:10:15] every picture here the press conference
[1:10:16] here the governor did you hear that
[1:10:18] president hear what they said and y'all
[1:10:20] can almost just and if you're not
[1:10:21] careful you begin to ingest so much of
[1:10:24] that that you may never physically fill
[1:10:27] it but in your spirit you starting to
[1:10:30] feel that that little unease and unrest
[1:10:33] we got to be careful it's good to be
[1:10:35] informed but you better be balanced with
[1:10:36] how much you're taking in I'd say with
[1:10:39] every minute of the press conference you
[1:10:40] better be reading a minute of the Word
[1:10:42] of God a better ever every minute you
[1:10:44] hear the governor you better have a
[1:10:46] minute here in the prophet of God here
[1:10:48] in the Word of God that's your Shalom
[1:10:50] that's your rest notice it was there's
[1:10:55] an age of fear and and worry and and and
[1:10:59] you know what it is even Americans it's
[1:11:01] so amazing to me you know why the all
[1:11:03] this panic and pandemonium because
[1:11:04] America's such people's rights and that
[1:11:07] in a not just America but the end
[1:11:08] world as the age gets darker they
[1:11:11] worship life this life
[1:11:14] they literally worship this life and
[1:11:17] they do anything they can to prolong
[1:11:20] this life as much as they can that's why
[1:11:23] you don't see you you and I'm not
[1:11:25] getting into this this vain of thinking
[1:11:27] but you don't you don't you don't see
[1:11:29] the kind of precautions we're taking
[1:11:31] today you didn't see it and in the
[1:11:32] 1800's when they had the Vietnam when
[1:11:35] anyone but whatever that virus was
[1:11:37] called his Fanus flew and and you know
[1:11:40] all about all the different things it
[1:11:42] wasn't it wasn't you know you know what
[1:11:43] it was there wasn't as much worship of
[1:11:46] life as there is today they looked at
[1:11:48] death as a doorway to a better life
[1:11:50] say brother man is it wrong to want to
[1:11:53] live no by no means that's inside of you
[1:11:55] that's natural to want to live because
[1:11:57] you're gonna live one day and never die
[1:11:58] and live one day and never die but but
[1:12:04] we worship we worship material things
[1:12:07] think about this the people are an
[1:12:11] absolute rebellion people especially in
[1:12:14] the south or an absolute rebellion even
[1:12:17] our own governor other other governors
[1:12:19] shutting down quarantine shelter in
[1:12:21] place
[1:12:21] stay in your homes and arrow even our
[1:12:23] own governor I'm doing everything you
[1:12:25] can to impose to impose that and not not
[1:12:28] in put any kind of strict regulations
[1:12:30] and and try to just bid try you know
[1:12:31] let's just stay positive goes go as far
[1:12:34] as we came with precaution as to
[1:12:36] maintain some decent happiness what are
[1:12:40] they afraid of being in their houses my
[1:12:45] brother my sister if we're not if we'd
[1:12:48] be honest we can be guilty of the same
[1:12:49] thing to where we're almost stir-crazy
[1:12:52] what's happened to us we've gone if
[1:12:54] we've just on the treadmill of life
[1:12:56] we've gotten so used to go go go go go
[1:12:59] go go go go go go and then God says
[1:13:01] Paul's and everyone's just like I can't
[1:13:05] do this I got a snack I gotta go we
[1:13:07] gotta go we gotta go we gotta go
[1:13:08] can't stop Trump saying can't stop we
[1:13:10] got to keep it going all right we got to
[1:13:11] get to get this country back on gotta
[1:13:13] get it going what is it they love that
[1:13:14] treadmill they love that rat race
[1:13:18] want to go go go go go don't stop don't
[1:13:21] slow down I'm chasing something I'm
[1:13:23] seeking something you're messing up my
[1:13:24] plan they're not ready for this
[1:13:29] even just a little 15-day 30-day
[1:13:32] quarantines stay in your homes everyone
[1:13:33] shelter in place for 15 days it's just
[1:13:35] it's just unbelievable they could never
[1:13:37] fathom it should tell you where we're at
[1:13:41] in this country and it's and it's
[1:13:46] getting worse the world is constantly
[1:13:48] evolving they're getting worse and worse
[1:13:50] and worse and a panic and ependymal and
[1:13:53] you look even as you see it there's
[1:13:54] there's a rapid acceleration and I know
[1:13:57] you know you can go off balance with
[1:13:59] this but let me just say this there's a
[1:14:00] rapid acceleration in the world if you
[1:14:03] just follow weather look at the weather
[1:14:04] patterns we've had here in Buford with
[1:14:06] hurricanes over the last just few years
[1:14:08] we've been here twenty-something plus
[1:14:10] years and we've had warnings of
[1:14:12] hurricanes but never real any damage
[1:14:14] only in these last few years that we had
[1:14:15] hurricane after hurricane after
[1:14:16] hurricane unpredictable weather patterns
[1:14:20] you think that's what is he said by than
[1:14:22] that what does that mean it just means
[1:14:24] the Bible once again has been proven to
[1:14:26] be true that the scripture says nature
[1:14:30] is traveling groaning within itself even
[1:14:33] even death nature even nature's groaning
[1:14:36] and travailing within itself ready to be
[1:14:40] delivered birth pains contractions ready
[1:14:44] to rid itself of sin we see it in the
[1:14:47] world it's a a number of you could think
[1:14:50] of calamities and hurricanes and
[1:14:52] tornados and earthquakes and and if you
[1:14:54] watch earthquakes happening more rapidly
[1:14:56] now right now you say global warming God
[1:14:59] believe in global warming a hundred
[1:15:01] percent I'm a believer in global warming
[1:15:03] now let don't believe it's caused by
[1:15:06] what the Democrats say it's caused by
[1:15:07] but the world is absolutely falling
[1:15:11] apart this was what the Prophet told us
[1:15:13] your body's falling apart the earth is
[1:15:16] falling apart man has destroyed the
[1:15:20] earth why would why why would we be
[1:15:22] surprised by that it's right in the Word
[1:15:24] of God
[1:15:27] probably going to get in trouble for
[1:15:29] that one
[1:15:29] okay it's it's it goes it right in line
[1:15:33] with what I believe the world's falling
[1:15:37] apart and it's happening just over the
[1:15:42] last few years you can see a rapid
[1:15:44] acceleration towards just disaster after
[1:15:46] disaster after disaster things happen
[1:15:49] and so you know what the Bible says in
[1:15:51] Ecclesiastes it said in much wisdom is
[1:15:53] much grief and he that increaseth and
[1:15:56] knowledge increases in sorrow and the
[1:16:00] more man has fed upon the tree of
[1:16:03] knowledge and good and evil the more
[1:16:04] sorrow has increased in the world and I
[1:16:08] preached on that here today but I
[1:16:09] believe it's absolutely true it's a
[1:16:11] world ingested and panic and pandemonium
[1:16:14] and in fear you notice even when Moses
[1:16:18] is going to give the Ten Commandments
[1:16:20] and they come down to the very end of
[1:16:22] that if you look all the way down there
[1:16:24] and maybe maybe just to do it we'll just
[1:16:26] turn to it brother Joe let's turn to
[1:16:30] Exodus chapter 20 and and notice what it
[1:16:33] says there next is chapter 20 and this
[1:16:35] I'm just gonna read the very in and
[1:16:36] verse 18 it says in all the people Moses
[1:16:39] gives all these Commandments and it says
[1:16:41] and all the people heard the thunderings
[1:16:44] and they seen the Lightning's and and
[1:16:46] they they hear the noise of the trumpet
[1:16:48] in the mountains smoking it when the
[1:16:50] people saw it they remove they step back
[1:16:52] they stood afar off they said unto Moses
[1:16:54] - don't stones you need you don't do
[1:16:57] that again you need to be the one to
[1:16:58] speak to us they were afraid they were
[1:17:00] quaking in fear and he says but don't
[1:17:03] let God speak to us lest we die and
[1:17:05] Moses notice verse 20 and Moses said
[1:17:08] unto the people fear not for God has
[1:17:12] come to prove you which means to test
[1:17:14] you and that that his notice that his
[1:17:18] fear so there's a unhealthy fear but
[1:17:23] then there's a healthy fear we love to
[1:17:26] quote the scripture that the angels of
[1:17:28] the Lord are surrounding us that that
[1:17:30] word that word that were surrounded but
[1:17:32] the Bible says it this way the lord
[1:17:34] encamps them that fear him
[1:17:40] so you want to have a press not just
[1:17:42] given to anybody I'm a son of God I'm a
[1:17:44] daughter of God so the Lord you know it
[1:17:46] just surrounds me no the Bible says
[1:17:48] there's a the Angels in camp around
[1:17:50] those who fear the Lord who feared the
[1:17:53] name what is that fear remember what we
[1:17:55] said last Sunday in Sunday school it's
[1:17:57] not a terror like Saul the Bible says
[1:18:00] Saul was in terror he was in panic he
[1:18:02] wasn't he was in fear but fear fear is
[1:18:06] not fear like this in the sense of being
[1:18:08] afraid but fear is the awareness of the
[1:18:12] presence of a living God that's what it
[1:18:16] means to fear the Lord that you
[1:18:18] recognize that he's real that you're
[1:18:23] accountable then that did not what did
[1:18:25] what is the following verse a he says
[1:18:26] that his fear may be before your face is
[1:18:29] that here's the purpose that you sin not
[1:18:32] if you don't believe the Lord is as he
[1:18:37] says his fear may be before your faces
[1:18:39] his presence his glory that he's here if
[1:18:41] you don't believe in that then you just
[1:18:43] live any way that you want to live but
[1:18:46] if you fear the Lord you're aware of a
[1:18:48] hull of a holy God you're aware of a
[1:18:51] righteous God who desires righteousness
[1:18:53] and holiness from your life the fear of
[1:18:55] the Lord is to recognize that say Lord
[1:18:58] you're here in the midst of it all
[1:19:00] you're here I have an awareness that
[1:19:03] you're here that you never leave me you
[1:19:05] never forsake me it's an awareness
[1:19:07] brother Branham said they don't
[1:19:08] recognize they don't reverence the
[1:19:10] presence of God because they don't
[1:19:11] recognize the presence of God are you
[1:19:14] here so there's a healthy fear an
[1:19:16] unhealthy fear he says that he says that
[1:19:19] you may receive this is what he says
[1:19:22] that his fear may be before your face is
[1:19:25] that you send up now notice how Paul in
[1:19:28] Hebrews do brother Joe hebrews chapter
[1:19:29] 12 and verse let's just read here verse
[1:19:32] 18 he's gonna parallel this notice what
[1:19:36] he says here Hebrews chapter 12 verse 18
[1:19:39] for you are not come unto the mount that
[1:19:42] might be touched and that burned with
[1:19:45] fir you're not coming to the mount that
[1:19:46] might be touched and that burned with
[1:19:48] fires speaking there what we just read
[1:19:51] an exodus nor until blackness and
[1:19:52] darkness
[1:19:53] contempt us and the sound of the trumpet
[1:19:54] the voice of words which voice that they
[1:19:57] that heard and treated that the words
[1:19:59] should not be spoken to them anymore for
[1:20:01] they could not endure that which was
[1:20:03] commanded and if so much as a beast
[1:20:05] touch the mountain it should be stoned
[1:20:06] or thrust with the dart and so terrible
[1:20:09] was the sight that Moses said I
[1:20:11] exceedingly fear and quake but you are
[1:20:17] come to Mount Zion and to the city of
[1:20:21] the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem
[1:20:24] and to an innumerable company you know
[1:20:31] the company is the Bravo Company the
[1:20:33] Alpha Company you're come to the
[1:20:36] innumerable company
[1:20:38] it's a heavenly host that's why God says
[1:20:42] the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his
[1:20:45] name the Lord is a man of Gerrits are
[1:20:49] are thrown in and going through the
[1:20:51] entire world today streaming in all the
[1:20:54] world in another dimension
[1:20:55] it's an angelic battle that's taking
[1:20:58] place right now he says you're come on
[1:21:00] to Mount Zion I'm so glad for that to an
[1:21:03] innumerable company of angels to the
[1:21:06] General Assembly in the Church of the
[1:21:08] firstborn which are written in heaven
[1:21:09] and to the God and to God the judge of
[1:21:12] all and this to the spirits of just men
[1:21:14] made perfect and to Jesus the mediator
[1:21:17] of the New Covenant blood of sprinkling
[1:21:19] that speaketh better things than that of
[1:21:20] Abel notice this here he says in verse
[1:21:23] 26 whose voice then shook the earth but
[1:21:27] now he have promised saying yet once
[1:21:28] more I shake not the Earth but also only
[1:21:32] but also heaven and this word well yet
[1:21:35] once more signifies the removing of
[1:21:37] those things that are shaken as of
[1:21:40] things that are made that those things
[1:21:42] which cannot be shaken may remain
[1:21:43] wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[1:21:47] cannot be moved let us have grace
[1:21:51] whereby we may serve God except ibly
[1:21:55] with reverence and godly fear so we said
[1:22:01] the entire world is shaking it's a cloud
[1:22:04] of panic it's a cloud
[1:22:06] of pandemonium it's a cloud of chaos and
[1:22:10] uncertainty it's paralyzing the entire
[1:22:14] world that we're living in let me tell
[1:22:17] you what Jesus says here is we just turn
[1:22:19] a corner and we close notice what Jesus
[1:22:21] says here and I want you to turn to
[1:22:23] Matthew chapter 10 quickly their brother
[1:22:26] Joe if you've got it Matthew chapter 10
[1:22:29] I want you to notice what he says here
[1:22:31] in verse 28 he says and fear not them
[1:22:36] which kill the body but are not able to
[1:22:40] kill the soul but instead fear him which
[1:22:46] is able to destroy both soul and body in
[1:22:51] hell now notice how he follows this up
[1:22:54] this is this is a command to the
[1:22:55] disciples fear not
[1:22:57] he says notice he injects this right
[1:23:00] here are not two sparrows two sparrows
[1:23:05] sold for a farthing and one of them
[1:23:09] shall not fall on the ground without
[1:23:11] your father but the hairs now is gonna
[1:23:15] change from sparrows to hairs but the
[1:23:17] hairs of your head are all numbered fear
[1:23:23] you not therefore you are more valuable
[1:23:29] than many sparrows whosoever therefore
[1:23:33] shall confess me now notice this he uses
[1:23:35] this example in fear not and he's gonna
[1:23:38] use this Sparrow right a book of a man
[1:23:41] who was speaking about the sparrows it
[1:23:42] was so powerful some of the some of what
[1:23:45] if you study just a sparrow and this is
[1:23:48] the word bird
[1:23:59] you
[1:24:19] of sparrows and and and notice what it
[1:24:23] says it's this it's this delicate bird
[1:24:26] this little this is the bird Jesus uses
[1:24:28] this little delicate Sparrow sparrows
[1:24:32] known for their music you ever go out in
[1:24:35] the morning and you hear the sparrows
[1:24:36] just if you have bushes especially you
[1:24:38] could hear them just you don't see them
[1:24:40] but you can just hear them and they're
[1:24:41] singing and cooing and they all have
[1:24:42] different Tunes and different melodies
[1:24:44] sing in different pitch but they they're
[1:24:46] known for their music they actually sing
[1:24:49] in as many as 22 Birds
[1:24:51] there's song sparrows larks vesper
[1:24:55] sparrows white-throated Sparrow z-- and
[1:24:57] all of them have to do with their names
[1:25:00] have to do with music and so notice if
[1:25:03] you look at the anatomy of a sparrow
[1:25:05] it's a thin I almost had a picture here
[1:25:07] but I didn't have time to put it up
[1:25:08] there bones are small little bones
[1:25:11] strong and they're there they're
[1:25:13] specifically designed for flying even
[1:25:15] scientists today has not matched or
[1:25:18] mimic or been able to replicate the
[1:25:20] anatomy of it the structure of a spare
[1:25:24] of how how smooth they fly and they they
[1:25:29] might say they they can they can fly and
[1:25:32] migrate over 2,000 miles every year a
[1:25:37] sparrow has between one thousand three
[1:25:40] hundred to two thousand and six hundred
[1:25:43] feathers over 2,600 feathers they're
[1:25:47] detailed you know why cuz we had a
[1:25:50] detailed God who detailed ly he designed
[1:25:54] them by detail every bone they're
[1:25:56] perfect every feather and the Bible says
[1:25:59] he counted every single one every single
[1:26:04] fair every single sparrow and you know
[1:26:08] miss sparrows love to nest in the ground
[1:26:10] and so when those days you know that
[1:26:12] they would trap them this is why you
[1:26:13] hear David in Psalms 91 when David would
[1:26:16] say we all should not be afraid of the
[1:26:18] snare of the Fowler you've heard of the
[1:26:21] snare of the Fowler in the Bible it's
[1:26:23] because in biblical days they didn't
[1:26:25] have a shotgun
[1:26:31] the ground and and Jesus could look in
[1:26:33] the market even there they were selling
[1:26:35] sparrows he's speaking to them he would
[1:26:36] use common things around them and he's
[1:26:39] speaking of these of these sparrows that
[1:26:41] would become trapped and they would they
[1:26:44] would become trapped in these traps him
[1:26:46] and they would be today what they would
[1:26:48] be I killed and then and notice what he
[1:26:50] says here Jesus says out of all these
[1:26:53] birds out of all the birds in the earth
[1:26:56] your father now
[1:27:05] you
[1:27:40] blanket the human head and I know some
[1:27:43] of you have lost some of the host and
[1:27:44] that's not your number and maybe you
[1:27:47] have way less of a number but even even
[1:27:50] even a person who is bold they're
[1:27:52] Sciences feathers even avail us of hair
[1:27:54] which is unseen by the human eye it has
[1:27:57] thousands of hair underneath it and
[1:28:00] Jesus says notice it wasn't just hair
[1:28:03] wasn't just yet God didn't give you hair
[1:28:04] just just a you know furred for beauty
[1:28:15] you
[1:28:26] over your eyes are there to prevent
[1:28:29] sweat
[1:28:33] but from going directly into your eyes
[1:28:35] because if you read sweat in your eyes
[1:28:36] and you
[1:28:39] bribe browse a few have extraneous
[1:28:41] workout
[1:28:45] the eyebrows were there God put them
[1:28:47] there for a purpose to keep sweat even
[1:28:49] the eyelashes they
[1:28:53] too close to your eyebrow that senses
[1:28:56] those nerves since it in your eyes
[1:28:57] closed tiny little bitty hairs inside of
[1:29:00] your ear inside of your nostrils to
[1:29:03] prevent particles and things that would
[1:29:04] be harmful for you come in and turn
[1:29:07] inside of your body
[1:29:08] what was it every even if you look at a
[1:29:10] picture of hair and you look at an acre
[1:29:12] scope it has a circular of veins going
[1:29:16] through it a little cylinder cells that
[1:29:18] go around that hair total deep down into
[1:29:22] the skin to read there's a around each
[1:29:25] one of those hair has little blood
[1:29:27] vessels that nourish each one of those
[1:29:29] hairs every hair and muscles nerves
[1:29:32] clans that support it it's amazing if
[1:29:38] you look at in the encyclopedia look at
[1:29:39] a picture could you could look at it
[1:29:41] Wikipedia and you can see the human hair
[1:29:43] in the cross sections that that go
[1:29:45] through in the mirror has different hair
[1:29:47] the little rings of tissues that
[1:29:48] surround every single chunk of hair even
[1:29:50] the way that color is determined the
[1:29:53] colors determined by by a system I'm not
[1:29:58] even going to try to pronounce some of
[1:29:59] these scientific words but a little
[1:30:01] small cluster of glands drains into
[1:30:05] every single hair that that produces a
[1:30:08] certain chemical that gives your hair a
[1:30:10] certain color God is intricately
[1:30:12] designed it and remember Matthew 10
[1:30:16] they're not and he's going to use the
[1:30:18] sparrow and he's gonna say even the
[1:30:20] hairs of your head are numbered you know
[1:30:25] what now I know why David could say I am
[1:30:27] he says I am fearfully and wonderfully
[1:30:30] made the God took time he took plan and
[1:30:36] in Jesus formed the human body he
[1:30:38] numbered every single hair Colossians
[1:30:41] says for by him we're all things created
[1:30:44] without him was nothing created and in
[1:30:47] him through him do all everything both
[1:30:51] animate inanimate consists and has its
[1:30:55] beam you know Jesus could have looked at
[1:30:58] Peter and he could have he could have
[1:31:00] absolutely looked at Peter and said
[1:31:01] Peter let me tell you something don't
[1:31:03] fear let me tell you something on
[1:31:04] yourself Peter you have two hundred
[1:31:06] thousand

[1:31:18] left eye you have you have you know 439

[1:31:23] disciple on him he could he could start
[1:31:24] telling them how many hairs they have on
[1:31:27] their body he could have looked at him
[1:31:28] and said James there's over there's over
[1:31:31] 100 27 tire 2,000,000 339,000 sparrows
[1:31:36] in the world today and in the market
[1:31:39] right now there's 933 of them for sale
[1:31:42] you know Holly could have said that
[1:31:44] because he said I've numbered every one
[1:31:46] of your hairs I've counted every single
[1:31:49] sparrow and I see every one that falls
[1:31:52] not one falls to the ground without your
[1:31:55] father in Heaven's knowledge that's why
[1:32:00] I says be careful for nothing
[1:32:02] don't be anxious over anything you worry
[1:32:06] over food and rain knit and clothing and
[1:32:08] coronavirus and these viruses that come
[1:32:10] in the world and the world's falling
[1:32:12] apart
[1:32:12] don't fear there's a God who sees every
[1:32:17] Sparrow counts every hair and let me
[1:32:19] tell you something what Jesus said he
[1:32:21] says you're more valuable than every
[1:32:23] sparrow I've put more value I've put
[1:32:27] don't be careful for anything trust me
[1:32:30] Peter trust a God who can number the
[1:32:34] hairs on your head
[1:32:35] trust the God who can count every single
[1:32:37] sparrow trust him in the middle of your
[1:32:39] calamity trust him in the middle of the
[1:32:41] storm trust him in the middle of
[1:32:43] perplexity upon the world fear not that
[1:32:48] was his words fear him David picks this
[1:32:54] up and I'm running out of time can I
[1:32:56] have just a few more minutes
[1:32:57] I heard I've ready at home said preach
[1:33:01] for the man Psalms chapter 40 verse 5
[1:33:05] notice what David says here Psalms
[1:33:07] chapter 40 verse 5 he says many Oh Lord
[1:33:10] noticed this many Oh Lord my God are thy
[1:33:13] wonderful works which thou has done and
[1:33:15] thy thoughts which are to us-ward they
[1:33:18] cannot be reckoned up in order the
[1:33:20] thoughts that you have towards us cannot
[1:33:22] be reckoned up in order into the if I
[1:33:24] would declare and speak of them they are
[1:33:26] more than can be numbered and Psalms 139
[1:33:31] verse 17 how precious also are thy
[1:33:35] thoughts unto me O God how great is the
[1:33:38] sum of them if I could count them
[1:33:41] they're more in number than the sand the
[1:33:45] precious thoughts God's has towards you
[1:33:48] and you're worried even in Jeremiah we
[1:33:53] know the scripture there in Jeremiah
[1:33:54] chapter 29 verse 11 he says I know the
[1:33:57] thoughts that I think toward you saith
[1:33:59] the Lord thoughts of peace and not of
[1:34:02] evil to give you an expected in God
[1:34:05] thought of you when you were born he
[1:34:07] thought of you before you were born did
[1:34:11] you realize that even before you were
[1:34:13] born David says in Psalms chapter 20 a
[1:34:15] charged chapter 139 notice what David
[1:34:18] says here in Psalms 139 verse 16 he says
[1:34:22] thine eyes did it see Psalms 139 then
[1:34:25] Psalms 139 verse 16 the verse right
[1:34:27] before that brother Joe he says thine
[1:34:30] eyes did see my unformed substance yet
[1:34:34] being and all thy book all my members
[1:34:38] were written when his yet they were none
[1:34:41] of them even before I was made you
[1:34:43] already thought of me and already seen
[1:34:45] me he says in Psalms 22 verse 9 thou
[1:34:49] took me out of the womb thou did make me
[1:34:52] hope when I was upon my mother's breast
[1:34:54] I was cast upon thee from the womb thou
[1:34:57] are my God from my mother's belly
[1:35:01] thou art my god from my mother's belly
[1:35:09] that's what the lyrics of the song say
[1:35:12] I'm no longer a slave to fear from my
[1:35:14] mother's womb you have thought of me
[1:35:16] you've called me your own you place me
[1:35:18] you claim to me you've protected me
[1:35:20] you're keeping me you're watching me
[1:35:22] there's a host of angels surrounding me
[1:35:25] at all times are you glad for that
[1:35:29] Saints
[1:35:30] Lord thinks of you every part of you he
[1:35:33] thinks of your health he thinks of your
[1:35:36] well-being mentally emotionally
[1:35:37] physically spiritually he's a God who
[1:35:41] cares he's the God who keeps he's a God
[1:35:44] who protects us glad I got his
[1:35:46] protection over my life I can't
[1:35:49] comprehend that that God knows in
[1:35:51] numbers every single one of my hairs I
[1:35:53] can't even fathom that that he knows
[1:35:57] every Sparrow that falls I can't fathom
[1:35:58] that but here's the vision of the word
[1:36:00] of the Lord coming to me you're more
[1:36:03] valuable than all of that
[1:36:05] place more value on you those that fear
[1:36:09] the name of the Lord there's a host
[1:36:11] surrounding them at all times
[1:36:13] he keeps them he's the Lord thy keeper
[1:36:21] John I pray that thou should not take
[1:36:23] them out of the world but as thou should
[1:36:25] has keep them from the evil
[1:36:26] you know what keeping English has
[1:36:28] meanings there it means to retain
[1:36:30] possession to protect and preserve but
[1:36:33] when Jesus said I pray that thou shalt
[1:36:35] first John or John at first John but
[1:36:37] John 17 verse 15 he says I pray not that
[1:36:41] thou should has take them out of the
[1:36:42] world but that thou should keep them
[1:36:44] from the evil keep them from the evil
[1:36:50] that word keep in the Greek I don't know
[1:36:53] Greek I'm gonna pronounce this word
[1:36:55] wrong it's Furio it means this is what
[1:36:58] it means when he says don't take him out
[1:37:01] of the world but keep them to keep means
[1:37:04] to establish a military outpost to guard
[1:37:09] to him in to protect with a garrison
[1:37:13] it's second definition means to
[1:37:15] establish a fortress with a full
[1:37:18] military fortress with a full military
[1:37:22] apparatus it's third meaning means to
[1:37:26] discern the enemy father in advance and
[1:37:29] protect from Jay danger this is the
[1:37:32] prayer Jesus prayed over you don't take
[1:37:34] him out of it but while they're in an
[1:37:36] evil world that's falling apart
[1:37:38] surround them Oh God
[1:37:42] protect them Oh Lord the name of the
[1:37:45] Lord is a strong tower that the
[1:37:47] righteous run into and are safe glad I'm
[1:37:52] safe here today but I got safekeeping a
[1:37:56] God who keeps me protects me he's the
[1:37:58] god of Angel armies as I close here
[1:38:04] today I and I could got much more wicked
[1:38:08] we could even read David just as the
[1:38:10] Psalms are just filled with it but I
[1:38:14] just I want to come to a close here you
[1:38:16] know even before this we we had our just
[1:38:19] surround just gathered there with with
[1:38:22] my wife and children there at home and I
[1:38:24] begin to we just was doing just a little
[1:38:26] devotion and a little morning Bible
[1:38:28] study with the kids and the Lord the
[1:38:30] night before it came to me at Friday
[1:38:32] this is lie about a week ago Lord he
[1:38:34] came to me and I'm not a dreamer don't
[1:38:36] believe I have the gift never seen a
[1:38:38] gift of Dreams in my life and there was
[1:38:39] not even anything that was you know
[1:38:41] prophecy of any kind but the Lord just
[1:38:43] all night long I just was like one dream
[1:38:46] after the next after the next and and
[1:38:47] there that you know they weren't wasn't
[1:38:49] there wasn't really any necessarily
[1:38:52] anything any rhyme or reason to the
[1:38:54] connection between East each of them but
[1:38:56] the Lord has begin to deal with my heart
[1:38:58] I woke up morning and and the Lord took
[1:39:01] me to Joseph in Egypt and and there he
[1:39:05] is and and the Bible says that there he
[1:39:08] is in prison and and the and the Baker
[1:39:10] you know the story the baker and the
[1:39:11] butler and then the butler comes back he
[1:39:13] go he he gets out of jail and Joseph
[1:39:16] still in jail and and he and he comes to
[1:39:18] the King begins to have these dreams the
[1:39:21] dreams of the you know the fat cows and
[1:39:24] and and he says there were seven fat
[1:39:25] cows and he says seven skinny cows and
[1:39:29] he says and then the fat cows there's
[1:39:31] the skinny cows ate the fat cows but
[1:39:33] they didn't become fat and then he said
[1:39:35] there were seven heads like of wheat and
[1:39:37] he says and they were all withered all
[1:39:39] set
[1:39:48] you
[1:40:54] any
[1:40:58] it's Joseph over
[1:41:02] since idiot II he
[1:41:06] there's of plenty when there were
[1:41:07] increased
[1:41:10] Hey and put away and he built
[1:41:16] during that time and he builds up and
[1:41:18] builds up when it seemed Joseph don't we
[1:41:20] have enough keep throwing it in keep
[1:41:21] throwing and then seems like a bad gonna
[1:41:23] be big get more build them higher
[1:41:28] Bible says later in the story that
[1:41:30] famine those seven years and in the
[1:41:32] seven years of famine and drought
[1:41:36] Joseph could see ahead and in the good
[1:41:40] times could have wisdom to put up for a
[1:41:47] and we know I had a great
[1:41:52] but the Lord began to tell me
[1:41:58] oceans there and I just begin to say you
[1:42:01] know I don't know
[1:42:04] the Lord just begin to
[1:42:11] our pastor spoke about the treadmill and
[1:42:13] I thought was
[1:42:16] he's he's turned
[1:42:20] at a million miles an hour
[1:42:24] times how fast your life is going not
[1:42:29] the nation we live in
[1:42:32] but our life is just going at a million
[1:42:35] miles an hour it's almost like a you
[1:42:37] know
[1:42:40] that when they're making a movie and you
[1:42:42] know they say action and everyone's
[1:42:44] moving and there's a
[1:42:48] then suddenly hey I cut and
[1:42:54] we'll stop rollin in the camera stop
[1:43:01] and I said in that just feel like that's
[1:43:03] exactly what's happened to us here
[1:43:08] go inna you know just as fast as it can
[1:43:11] go in that car I said you can get in the
[1:43:13] car
[1:43:16] now our down the highway and if your car
[1:43:18] will allow you to
[1:43:22] we'll stay right there moving in a
[1:43:24] hundred and thirty miles
[1:43:28] in and out of the car and and and move
[1:43:31] your position
[1:43:34] say stay smooth
[1:43:38] and that coffee
[1:43:42] for everyone's turned up
[1:43:46] this is what it feels like that
[1:43:50] and I'm sure all of you filled
[1:43:56] our children that were at school or at
[1:43:58] home
[1:44:02] slowed and and some of you who
[1:44:06] slowing down and some people
[1:44:10] you're home all the time and it just
[1:44:12] feels like your your routines you were
[1:44:15] in
[1:44:18] chasing your next opportunity chasing
[1:44:21] the next thing raising kids raising life
[1:44:23] looking ahead which you should be doing
[1:44:25] all of these things but suddenly that
[1:44:27] does it just the the director says cut
[1:44:31] and then
[1:44:34] and that car comes to a screeching halt
[1:44:38] and I said I just felt like everything
[1:44:40] has just been turned upside down but the
[1:44:42] voice
[1:44:44] well voice the Lord begin to say take
[1:44:47] take an opportunity out of this time to
[1:44:51] put things in order that maybe have been
[1:44:53] out of order for a way too long
[1:44:58] I've said cut just for a moment and then
[1:45:01] and and and the routines of life are
[1:45:04] disposed and slowed down here for a
[1:45:05] moment and the Lord began to speak and
[1:45:07] say start putting things in order start
[1:45:10] changing things look and assess your
[1:45:12] life assess everything around and the
[1:45:14] Lord said I'm going to stop the vehicle
[1:45:17] because there's certain things you need
[1:45:18] to or rearrange that you couldn't
[1:45:20] rearrange you tried but you couldn't
[1:45:22] rearrange them when you were going a
[1:45:24] million miles an hour
[1:45:25] but now I've given you this reprieve
[1:45:27] don't look at the I told my family I

[1:45:51] reaction to everything that's happened
[1:45:53] in the world today and and let me say

[1:45:57] this this this pandemic that's striking
[1:45:59] that the nation it means something to
[1:46:01] the world and maybe it doesn't mean the
[1:46:04] same thing to us but it does mean
[1:46:06] something and I'm not trying to put
[1:46:09] significance to what it means but it
[1:46:11] should I asked my family I said what
[1:46:13] what should we need to ask the Lord and
[1:46:15] I challenge you here tonight to say Lord

[1:48:38] all really praising and shouting here
[1:48:40] just a minute ago
[1:48:41] it's just that it's just it's it's a
[1:48:43] question I'm asking myself I'm not
[1:48:44] putting you out now I'm computing my own
[1:48:47] selfie what is what we all want the
[1:48:50] protection but what is our life look
[1:48:52] like you think God's gonna protect you
[1:48:54] and you ain't got the token applied to
[1:48:56] your home I see Lord let me let me let
[1:49:03] me take an opportunity let me change the
[1:49:06] things that need to change while the
[1:49:09] show is paused
[1:49:11] let me put things in order in my life
[1:49:13] what can I go through and look at and
[1:49:16] and and and take a inventory and take a
[1:49:19] candle and go through the home and try
[1:49:21] to find 11 in the house I just tell me
[1:49:24] what the Lord told me and said you could
[1:49:26] you try to change these things in your
[1:49:27] life before and you couldn't so I've
[1:49:30] stopped everything and I'm giving you
[1:49:32] just a minute times don't go all the way
[1:49:34] through this thing and the treble start
[1:49:36] and you didn't change anything but I
[1:49:38] said Lord what can I grow from this the
[1:49:41] press conference I heard the the press
[1:49:43] the president something I think it was
[1:49:45] the
[1:49:46] they're the FDA doctor there and and
[1:49:48] they said you know well what's gonna
[1:49:51] what's gonna happen are we ever gonna go
[1:49:52] back to normal well things ever go back
[1:49:54] will we ever gather back in here and and
[1:49:56] sort of a rhetorical question there but
[1:49:58] are we ever gonna you know his things we
[1:49:59] go ahead and Trump has said well no I he
[1:50:01] said I think I think there will be
[1:50:02] certain things that are changed forever
[1:50:04] he said I think there are certain things
[1:50:06] that will never go back to we're gonna
[1:50:09] look at hygiene differently we're gonna
[1:50:10] look at when we shake someone's hand
[1:50:12] differently he says well I think
[1:50:13] everything is going to be he says I
[1:50:15] think there's going to be changes that
[1:50:16] you see that'll it'll be beyond cova 19
[1:50:19] the Lord just spoke to me right there
[1:50:21] and said there needs to be things that
[1:50:23] you change now that are never the same
[1:50:27] when this thing resumes there needs to
[1:50:34] be certain ways that you look at certain
[1:50:37] things I tell you what it's going to
[1:50:38] change our approach and our attitude to
[1:50:39] come into the house of God to give a
[1:50:42] fresh appreciation for the family of God
[1:50:44] and one another and each other and
[1:50:46] fellowship and in harmony being here not
[1:50:49] just on Sundays but on Wednesdays being
[1:50:52] at prayer meetings because we can't have
[1:50:54] them right now
[1:50:55] got those men's breakfast we love them
[1:50:58] we can't have all right now you don't
[1:50:59] know what you got till you lose it but
[1:51:03] the Lord began to speak to me in to say
[1:51:05] change things now because it's gonna
[1:51:07] start again and those things I've given
[1:51:10] you this moment of reprieve to put
[1:51:12] things in order that have been out of
[1:51:15] order in your life musicians could you
[1:51:18] come stand to your feet let's just bow
[1:51:19] our heads together amen Lord Jesus at
[1:51:23] homes father in this church here Lord
[1:51:27] we've been affected by your word Lord
[1:51:31] we've been we've been challenged here
[1:51:32] tonight what is the fear of the Lord
[1:51:34] there's a good fear Lord you've taught
[1:51:36] us and then there's an unhealthy fear or
[1:51:40] not we don't fear what they fear Lord we
[1:51:43] don't we don't we don't panic like they
[1:51:45] panic we don't look at these things like
[1:51:47] the world looks at these things we have
[1:51:49] a different perspective we have a
[1:51:51] different way to look at it Lord but let
[1:51:53] us here tonight take a fresh look and
[1:51:55] say Lord but is what does it mean to
[1:51:57] fear the Lord does my life reflow
[1:52:00] this is mine is my reaction to all of
[1:52:04] this calamity in the world does it speak
[1:52:07] of the trust and the hope and the
[1:52:09] confidence I have in in the in and in
[1:52:11] the Lord or is my reaction been that of
[1:52:14] oh oh Lord the world's not looking for
[1:52:17] more doctrine Laura's not looking for
[1:52:19] the world's not looking for a better
[1:52:22] explanation of the creation Lord the
[1:52:27] church world does that they do good at
[1:52:28] that they debate the atheist and they
[1:52:30] debate the days of creation the debate
[1:52:32] the age of the the years and the the age
[1:52:34] of the earth and they do it Lord that's
[1:52:36] not what the world's hungry for they're
[1:52:38] not hungry for more doctrine or or how
[1:52:41] much knowledge we have or the better
[1:52:43] understanding or explanation or proof of
[1:52:46] of different things Lord but they're
[1:52:49] looking for somebody who could stand in
[1:52:52] the midst of calamity they're looking
[1:52:54] for a people who could stand in the
[1:52:56] midst when the rest of the world is
[1:52:58] shaking there's a bride who's resolute
[1:53:01] there's a people that is unfazed who
[1:53:06] doesn't fear though this thing who
[1:53:07] doesn't have a have a panic over what's
[1:53:11] happened in the world but has a strong
[1:53:13] assurance and a God who surrounding her
[1:53:16] a God who is protecting her a God who
[1:53:18] watches her and keeps her that's what
[1:53:21] the world's looking for Lord they're
[1:53:24] looking for a people who has faith and
[1:53:27] confidence and the promises of their God
[1:53:32] they're looking for someone who fears
[1:53:34] the Lord someone who has an awareness
[1:53:39] of a reality of a God who saves who
[1:53:43] keeps his alive who's the same yesterday
[1:53:45] today and forever O Lord I lift my hands
