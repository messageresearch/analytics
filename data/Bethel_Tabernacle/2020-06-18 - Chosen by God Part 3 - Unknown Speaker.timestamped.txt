[27:55] spirit form face to face
[27:57] we're as looking in a mirror amen and
[28:01] being changed to the same image from
[28:04] glory to glory but there'll be a day
[28:06] where we see him physically face to face
[28:10] and by every trial every trouble every
[28:14] difficulty we face will instantly be
[28:18] worth all of it amen let's pray gracious
[28:22] Heavenly Father we're so thankful for
[28:24] your grace to us Lord that you gave us
[28:28] hearts to respond to you that you opened
[28:33] our eyes of understanding to the reality
[28:35] of yourself in this day Lord that you
[28:39] caused us to come to you you called us
[28:43] you filled us with your spirit and your
[28:47] working Lord to change us and transform
[28:49] us by the renewing of our mind as we
[28:52] feast upon the word so Lord let it be in
[28:56] us tonight may we lay aside the
[28:58] distractions of life and the things of
[29:00] life and may we enter into the word
[29:03] which is changing us Lord we love you we
[29:09] need not just mic mechanics though we
[29:12] need it but we need the dynamics to come
[29:14] upon the word Lord as we heard such a
[29:18] incredible message on Sunday that if we
[29:22] just even just intellectually believe it
[29:25] that's good
[29:26] but the mic the dynamics need to come
[29:29] Lord and so if any are in that condition
[29:32] we ask the dynamics would come upon them
[29:34] even now that they might have the power
[29:37] to walk in newness of life so Lord we
[29:41] just want to step out of the way and ask
[29:43] you to work tonight we ask these things
[29:44] in Jesus name Amen
[29:47] so our just want to welcome our visitors
[29:51] again brother Tim and sister Kay Calhoun
[29:55] got to spend some time with them this
[29:57] week and sure appreciated it and really
[30:00] really good to know you so don't be
[30:02] strangers come on back so we're gonna
[30:06] look in the scriptures we're gonna
[30:07] continue on the series of chosen by God
[30:09] and we're gonna look at Ephesians 1
[30:16] verse 11 and tonight we're gonna buckle
[30:24] up everybody we're gonna be going
[30:26] through a ton of scriptures again so in
[30:29] whom also we have obtained an
[30:32] inheritance being predestinated
[30:34] according to the purpose of him who
[30:37] worketh all things after the counsel of
[30:39] his own will may the Lord had the
[30:41] blessing to the reading of his word you
[30:43] can be seated so God God doesn't merely
[30:49] make a plan and then the universe just
[30:53] follows in suit without him things
[31:04] - what for the perp for his purpose
[31:08] after the counsel of his own will where
[31:12] it says their work if it's the Greek
[31:15] word energy ale and it means to be
[31:20] active to be efficient so God is
[31:24] actively working
[31:26] he's efficiently working in his creation
[31:30] amongst his children what's the whole
[31:33] universe how abouts every atom amongst
[31:36] every molecule to accomplish his own
[31:40] will he says I'm muted I'm not muted so
[31:52] I'm just gonna turn it off rebooting is
[31:56] always good alright anything fails just
[32:03] reboot it so God is applying his energy
[32:11] his activity into accomplishing his
[32:15] purpose in the universe the word there
[32:20] where it says purpose is prothesis in
[32:24] Greek and it means a setting forth or an
[32:28] intended proposal in other words it
[32:32] speaks of a planned intent God's purpose
[32:35] is not generic there's a specific
[32:39] targeted planned intent that he has in
[32:44] in your life in every circumstance in
[32:47] your life and so he is putting his
[32:50] energy towards his plan which is
[32:55] accomplishing what your will his
[32:59] creations will know his own will and so
[33:07] we have to look at that and see that
[33:09] that God's plan in the earth it isn't
[33:14] based upon what you and I do
[33:16] it is him responding to us it's us
[33:21] responding to him and so it isn't us
[33:25] choosing and then God saying I ordained
[33:28] that choice it's God making a plan an
[33:31] intended plan that he is going to work
[33:36] out an accomplished on the earth so and
[33:40] he's putting his energy his power
[33:41] towards accomplish accomplishing that
[33:44] purpose so election predestination you
[33:52] know we use those words but we get many
[33:54] many times just use them and don't
[33:57] understand what we're talking about the
[33:59] election looks back to his foreknowledge
[34:02] foreknowledge is not just knowing what's
[34:06] going to happen it's planning and
[34:09] accomplishing a specific intended
[34:12] purpose so his foreknowledge is for
[34:15] ordination is really what it's speaking
[34:17] about not merely knowing what could
[34:19] happen we talked about before the
[34:22] difference between Calvinism and
[34:25] Arminianism
[34:27] both of them believe in predestination I
[34:32] know modern-day Baptists and charismatic
[34:35] Pentecostal will tell you they don't
[34:38] believe in predestination any church
[34:41] that believes says something like that
[34:43] pastor says something like that run from
[34:45] them as far as fast as you can because
[34:48] they're confessing they don't even
[34:49] believe the Bible
[34:51] that's dangerous our minion ism says
[34:54] God's choice is based upon your choice
[34:58] only so God sees what you chose and
[35:02] therefore ordains that to be so versus
[35:05] the Calvinist side says God works all
[35:10] things after the counsel of his own will
[35:12] God plans and purposes everything you
[35:15] coming to him is his work drawing you to
[35:18] himself he didn't look forward and say
[35:21] oh you chose me I'm gonna choose you in
[35:23] fact the Bible says the opposite the
[35:26] Bible says you haven't chosen me
[35:28] I have chosen you and ordained you to
[35:31] bring forth fruit so it's got our coming
[35:34] to christ is not based upon our choice
[35:37] it's based upon his choice before the
[35:40] world ever began and we'll look at that
[35:42] more clearly and establish it much more
[35:45] much more than what we have there in the
[35:48] sermon the rapture or the Branham says
[35:51] this now so you were in if you've got
[35:54] eternal life you were in God before
[35:57] there ever was a world you're a part a
[36:00] son of God an attribute of God he knowed
[36:03] the very age you were coming he
[36:05] predestinated you to that age to take
[36:07] that place and no one else can take it
[36:10] don't care how many impersonators and
[36:12] things you've got to be there because he
[36:14] knew you would be there now you are made
[36:16] manifest now you can fellowship with him
[36:19] and that's what he wants so it even
[36:24] really goes far beyond the fact that he
[36:27] chose us scripturally he chose us that's
[36:31] communicating to us in terms that we
[36:34] understand the fact is we are a part of
[36:38] his life a part of his attributes God is
[36:41] God is who he is he never changes he
[36:45] can't have a new thought if God has a
[36:48] new thought he's changed so God never
[36:51] has a new thought he never has a new
[36:54] attribute he is does not change so you
[37:00] were actually in him for eternity you
[37:05] and it was in him to manifest those
[37:09] attributes so you had to be had come
[37:13] come and be predestinated to a new body
[37:17] to a new purpose you it's not as though
[37:21] he said he looked around the world and
[37:23] said you know there's just a following
[37:25] bunch of people that happened and I'm
[37:26] just gonna grab this one that's not what
[37:29] God's plan and purpose was he is
[37:32] manifesting his own life his own
[37:36] attributes so you were in him before
[37:40] there ever was a creation
[37:42] not even just before it eternally if you
[37:46] have eternal life you never had a
[37:49] beginning and you'll never have heavy
[37:52] end the essential you who you are in the
[37:55] soul your flash out of beginning your
[37:58] even your spirit man had a beginning but
[38:00] that that gene of God which is in the
[38:03] soul never had a beginning never has an
[38:07] end it was a part of his thoughts and
[38:09] his thoughts are eternal John 3:16 for
[38:17] God so loved the world and I'm repeating
[38:20] some things and that's because I'm
[38:22] trying to repeat it so you remember it
[38:24] for God so loved the world that He gave
[38:27] His only begotten Son that whosoever
[38:28] believeth in him should not perish but
[38:31] have everlasting life this is what all
[38:34] my armenian and friends and college
[38:35] would argue with me it says whosoever
[38:38] will absolutely whosoever will who is
[38:42] whosoever will acts 13:48 and when the
[38:47] gentiles heard this they were glad and
[38:50] glorified the word of the lord and as
[38:52] many as were ordained to eternal life
[38:55] believed so who believes who is the
[38:59] whosoever will that believes in jesus
[39:01] christ the ones were ordained to eternal
[39:04] life and no one else exodus 33:19 and he
[39:13] said i will make all my goodness pass
[39:14] before thee and i will proclaim the name
[39:17] of the lord before thee and will be
[39:20] gracious to whom I will be gracious and
[39:23] will show mercy on whom I will show
[39:26] mercy isn't it interesting this is Moses
[39:28] saying I want to see I want to see you I
[39:31] want to say I want to see you and God
[39:34] says I will manifest myself to you I
[39:37] will reveal myself to you but I'm gonna
[39:40] do it on my choosing I'm gonna do it in
[39:43] my way I'm not doing it just because you
[39:45] asked I'm doing it because I will have
[39:47] mercy on whom I will have mercy what
[39:51] does that have to do with anything he's
[39:52] gonna manifest himself to those whom
[39:55] he's chosen
[39:56] to manifest himself too and we'll see
[39:59] that more clearly as we look at the
[40:01] words of Jesus in John so we'll look at
[40:06] that right away John 17 verse 6 I have
[40:10] manifested thy name unto the men which
[40:12] thou gavest me out of the world
[40:15] thine they were and thou gave us them me
[40:18] and they have kept thy word manifest is
[40:22] named everybody only the ones that he
[40:25] chose to have mercy and to be gracious
[40:27] to and here it says the men which thou
[40:31] gavest me I manifested your name what is
[40:38] what does that mean manifested your name
[40:42] it was the very presence of Almighty God
[40:45] on display before the people that's the
[40:48] name of God God placed his name in his
[40:52] son Jesus Christ but it's more than just
[40:55] a word a name it's a living presence
[41:00] it's it's a living reality they're
[41:03] manifested before the people the same
[41:06] can be applied to the bit to today when
[41:08] the Son of Man is revealed to us he was
[41:12] manifested to the one the men and women
[41:15] that were given to him out of the world
[41:18] it's not manifested it's not for
[41:20] everyone it's only those ones that God
[41:23] said I want mercy on whom I will have
[41:26] mercy
[41:28] Ephesians 2:10 for we are his
[41:31] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[41:34] good works which God hath before
[41:37] ordained that we should walk in them
[41:39] isn't that astounding even the good
[41:42] works that we do we can't claim that to
[41:46] be the originators of him we can't claim
[41:50] to be the offered author of them God
[41:53] Himself is actually the author of even
[41:57] your good works so the reality is you
[42:00] can't you can't do good works in
[42:06] yourself
[42:08] humanly speaking you can do good but
[42:11] that's not what God is talking about
[42:14] good works is his work his the only
[42:19] thing that he is qualified is the
[42:21] righteousness of God you say I'm a good
[42:23] person got nothing to do with it
[42:25] I know there's many good people has
[42:27] nothing to do with that God does not
[42:31] accept good people because there the
[42:34] fact is there isn't any
[42:36] there's no good there's no one good no
[42:40] not one there's none that seeks after
[42:43] God so it's it's him calling him drawing
[42:49] him even ordaining your good works that
[42:53] we should walk that we should walk in
[42:56] them what are you walking in today what
[43:00] works are you walking in today I hope
[43:04] God's works
[43:05] amen if it's God's works it's his
[43:08] righteousness being revealed through you
[43:12] Genesis 18 verse 19 for I know him that
[43:16] he will command his children in his
[43:18] household after him and they shall keep
[43:21] the way of the Lord to do justice and
[43:23] judgment that the Lord may bring upon
[43:25] Abraham that which he hath spoken of him
[43:29] that is God working other according to
[43:34] the purpose of his own will he says I
[43:36] know Abraham how did he know any bruh
[43:41] ham because Abraham was one of his
[43:45] attributes being manifested on this
[43:47] plate and part of that attribute was
[43:49] he's gonna teach he's gonna teach his
[43:51] children I know I know that he's gonna
[43:53] pass the truth on to his children and to
[43:56] his household after him and in doing
[44:01] that God will bring everything that was
[44:04] spoken of Abraham upon him
[44:07] 1st Corinthians 1:26 through 28 for you
[44:15] see your calling brethren how that not
[44:17] many wise men after the flesh not many
[44:20] mighty
[44:21] not many noble are called ouch what are
[44:26] you saying about me Paul can't can't I
[44:30] want him to say some nicer things but if
[44:33] you see after the flesh that's the truth
[44:38] not many mighty not many noble are
[44:41] called the nobility the big rich people
[44:43] you know don't have need for God got
[44:47] everything in this life but God has
[44:50] chosen the foolish things of the world
[44:53] to confound the wise and God hath chosen
[44:57] the weak things of the world to confound
[44:59] the things which are mighty did you ever
[45:02] think about this verse that probably in
[45:05] their lifetime
[45:07] none of those rich people were really
[45:10] confounded or confused but there's
[45:13] coming a day at the judgment they're
[45:17] gonna be confounded and confused
[45:19] confused why because the very people
[45:21] standing in front of them to judge them
[45:23] are the ones that they considered Retton
[45:26] refuse garbage and filth and here they
[45:29] are gonna be standing in fine linen
[45:32] clean and white judging them according
[45:36] to their works
[45:37] astounding he'll do God is gonna do it
[45:40] he's gonna confound him that promise
[45:42] might not have come to pass in those
[45:44] people's lifetime and it may not come to
[45:45] pass in our own lifetime but it's going
[45:49] to come to pass Abraham did not receive
[45:51] a city or an inheritance in his lifetime
[45:54] but he's going to still hasn't received
[45:57] it in fact but he's going to and base
[46:03] things of the world and things which are
[46:05] despised has God chosen yea and things
[46:08] which are not to bring to nothing things
[46:12] that are isn't God's choosing incredible
[46:16] we look at it and wonder at ourselves
[46:18] and say what what there's nothing about
[46:21] me
[46:21] yeah that's why God chose you because
[46:25] he's gonna use you to confound the
[46:29] mighty and the noble and the wise men so
[46:34] it's not it's not a
[46:35] wonder that we look at ourselves and say
[46:37] we're not a big deal exactly exactly
[46:46] that's what God that's how God works
[46:48] that's what he does he said that's what
[46:50] he chose so don't be confused about it
[46:53] just rejoice Deuteronomy 7 7 and 8 the
[46:59] Lord did not set his love upon you nor
[47:02] choose you because you were more in
[47:03] number than any people for you were the
[47:05] fewest of all people but because the
[47:09] Lord loved you isn't that incredible he
[47:13] doesn't really explain why he loved them
[47:17] he said I didn't chose I didn't choose
[47:19] you based upon who you were what you
[47:22] look like or what position you had I
[47:24] mean if God was gonna do it as man does
[47:27] it he would have chosen the Egyptians
[47:29] and my he would have written could have
[47:31] revealed himself and taken over the
[47:33] whole world and the Millennium would
[47:35] have been right on that's not God's Way
[47:38] God doesn't do work that way he wants to
[47:41] receive glory unto himself that's why he
[47:45] chooses people like you and me to reveal
[47:48] himself through but because the Lord
[47:52] loved you well why did he love me
[47:54] because he did I will have mercy on whom
[47:59] I will have mercy I will love who all I
[48:02] love it's his choice it's his choosing
[48:05] it's his plan it's his purpose but
[48:10] because the Lord loved you and because
[48:11] he would keep the oath which he had
[48:13] sworn unto your father's why did God
[48:18] choose you he chose you because of
[48:20] himself isn't that it's astounding so
[48:24] when you think about the the big picture
[48:27] of your life God chose you God gave you
[48:31] his spirit God is working in you for
[48:34] what for what purpose because he's
[48:37] centered on you not really he's centered
[48:42] on himself God is looking to accomplish
[48:45] his own will his own purpose
[48:48] his own glory and because of that he's
[48:52] gonna make sure that you come to the end
[48:56] in holiness and righteousness with a new
[49:00] body because he'd keep the oath which he
[49:06] had sworn unto your father's hath the
[49:09] Lord brought you out with a mighty hand
[49:11] and redeemed you out of the house of the
[49:13] bond of a bondman from the hand of
[49:16] Pharaoh king of Egypt he did it because
[49:19] he chose to do it he wanted to manifest
[49:21] himself even hardened Pharaoh's heart so
[49:25] that he could be sure that he received
[49:27] full glory for what happened James 2
[49:33] verse 5 hearken my beloved brethren hath
[49:38] not God chosen the poor of this world
[49:40] rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom
[49:43] which he had promised to them that love
[49:46] him you see our thinking many times is
[49:49] so wrong we look at God's blessings and
[49:52] we think about finance cars houses bank
[49:58] accounts stock market but that's not
[50:01] God's value rich in faith not rich and
[50:08] stuff your approval your blessing from
[50:13] God has nothing to do with your
[50:15] financial standing what your position
[50:18] you are in this world whether you get
[50:20] ahead or whether you don't get ahead
[50:22] God's value upon you is because he chose
[50:26] you and he's working in your life and he
[50:29] chose you rich in faith and that matters
[50:31] more than anything else in this world
[50:34] the world tries to tell us something
[50:36] else the world tries to force us into
[50:38] some box based upon what position life
[50:42] we're at where we live what culture were
[50:44] under but we don't have to be limited by
[50:48] that
[50:50] let your faith swing out to the Word of
[50:54] God in the place that he wants to have
[50:56] you in yeah he took chose the poor of
[51:00] this world rich in faith and heirs of
[51:03] the kingdom which he had promised to
[51:05] them that love him Matthew 2:1 21 and
[51:17] she shall bring forth I was just looking
[51:21] at these verses and I want you to think
[51:23] about especially in this verse is who
[51:28] did Jesus come to save who did he die
[51:33] for and she shall bring forth a son and
[51:36] thou shalt call his name Jesus for he
[51:41] shall save who his people from their
[51:46] sins Christ died for his people the
[51:53] Bible says in another place that he died
[51:54] for the sins of the whole world so why
[52:00] do we have the tension between these two
[52:01] verses what world is he talking about
[52:05] you're not of the world so that mean he
[52:08] didn't die for us no he's talking about
[52:11] a different world he's talking about the
[52:14] other another Kingdom another people not
[52:17] that not the whole people of the earth
[52:19] he definitely died for those that were
[52:22] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[52:24] before the foundation of the world
[52:28] familiar verse Matthew 22:14 for many
[52:30] are called but few are chosen
[52:34] the word goes forth to many though the
[52:39] truth is preached to many but few are
[52:42] chosen to hear and receive it John 10 26
[52:48] through 29 but ye believe not because
[52:53] you are not of my sheep as I said unto
[52:57] you why don't they believe
[52:59] why don't they accept Jesus why can't
[53:01] they hear the truth
[53:03] because they're not of his sheep verse
[53:08] 27 my sheep hear my voice and I know
[53:11] them and they follow me
[53:14] so his sheep hear his voice but the
[53:18] other sheep they don't hear it they
[53:20] can't receive it they're not ordained to
[53:23] receive it verse 28 and I give unto them
[53:27] eternal life and they shall never perish
[53:30] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[53:34] my hand my father which gave them me is
[53:37] greater than all and no man is able to
[53:39] pluck them out of my father's hand I and
[53:43] my father are one aren't you glad Jesus
[53:47] and the father are one in what are they
[53:49] one in we usually take this to the
[53:53] doctrine of the Godhead and that's
[53:55] absolutely applicable but this verse
[53:57] actually is speaking about their oneness
[54:00] in the fact that he will keep us to the
[54:04] end will never perish and no one will
[54:09] pluck us out of his hand does that can
[54:12] you pluck yourself out of his hand
[54:15] no one can not even you can pluck
[54:19] yourself out of his hand no one can take
[54:21] you away from Jesus Christ
[54:23] no devil in hell not yourself not your
[54:28] family not false believers not demonic
[54:34] governments which is every government so
[54:39] who who can really separate us from the
[54:42] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[54:45] Lord no one no one John 17 - as thou has
[54:53] given him power over all flesh that he
[54:55] should give eternal life to as many to
[54:59] everyone know to as many as thou has
[55:03] given him so eternal life goes to the
[55:06] ones that God gave to Christ were chosen
[55:09] in Christ before the foundation of the
[55:11] world were a part of his life he's given
[55:14] us eternal life
[55:16] those ones that the father gave to him
[55:19] second Timothy to verse 10
[55:23] therefore I endure all things for the
[55:26] elects sake that they may also obtain
[55:28] the salvation which is in Christ Jesus
[55:31] with eternal glory
[55:34] so Paul there as a minister understands
[55:41] that he can do he can go through
[55:43] everything every trial every difficulty
[55:47] every beating he can take all of that
[55:50] imprisonment for the elects sake because
[55:54] you know there's a there's Pete there's
[55:56] predestinated seed out there that are
[55:58] going to hear what if it was an Arminian
[56:02] gospel Paul would say I you know I'm
[56:06] perfecting my preaching style so that
[56:10] more people will listen we're getting a
[56:12] better worship program so that more
[56:15] people will hear we're me we're putting
[56:17] a coffee shop in the lobby so that we
[56:21] can draw a bigger crowd we're putting
[56:24] our song leader brother Brad we're
[56:26] getting them in a leather jacket leather
[56:28] coat and some skinny jeans so I can
[56:32] appeal to the young people that's what
[56:37] they're different that's what the world
[56:38] is doing that's what they're doing I can
[56:41] do they're saying I'll do all these
[56:42] things because we don't know who's gonna
[56:45] respond anybody could respond and it's
[56:47] based on our efforts
[56:49] you know how well we do it that causes
[56:51] the people to respond to Jesus Christ
[56:55] but Paul was the opposite he said I'll
[56:58] go I'll go to hell itself preaching the
[57:01] gospel because I know on my way on my
[57:04] way there there's people are gonna
[57:06] listen I'll go to the gates of Hell and
[57:09] preach that because people the elect
[57:11] will hear I mean how how terrible would
[57:16] it be you know for her for a missionary
[57:19] to go thinking it was based upon his own
[57:22] efforts its proclaiming the word you can
[57:25] endure the hard things for the sake of
[57:29] lect why because he's chosen them they
[57:32] will hear if he's sending you he scented
[57:35] you for a purpose someone's going to
[57:37] hear so let's look at Romans chapter 9
[57:41] if you want to I able to pull that up
[57:42] brother Romans chapter 9 verse 10 and
[57:45] we're gonna go through verse by verse
[57:47] verse 10 and not only this but when
[57:53] Rebekah had also conceived by one even
[57:57] by our Father Isaac verse 11 for the
[58:00] children being not yet born neither
[58:03] having done any good or evil that the
[58:06] purpose of God according to election
[58:07] might stand not of works but of him that
[58:12] calleth now I want you to I want to look
[58:14] at this verse more deeply because in the
[58:18] Armenian understanding that God is
[58:20] basing his choice upon our choice
[58:23] we look here Paul is emphasizing the
[58:27] children not being yet born
[58:30] they weren't even born not not only they
[58:34] weren't even born but they haven't done
[58:37] any good or evil so God is not choosing
[58:40] them based upon what good or evil he
[58:44] knows that he's planned that Jacob and
[58:47] Esau will do he is choosing them simply
[58:50] according to election he's saying that
[58:55] he's making this choice that the purpose
[58:58] of God according to election might stand
[59:00] and then so that we're not confused he
[59:03] adds it even further and says not of
[59:05] works but of him that calleth so that
[59:13] God the sort says might stand speaks
[59:17] there in the Greek of to stay in a given
[59:21] place state or relationship of
[59:24] expectancy so in other words he wants
[59:28] his purpose of election to be made clear
[59:30] he wants it to be he wants it to be so
[59:34] that we understand you know those things
[59:37] that happened back then it was for that
[59:39] purpose then but it was also as an
[59:42] example to us so Paul could take it and
[59:46] show us the true doctrine of election
[59:48] now it shouldn't be any confusion now we
[59:52] don't have to misunderstand what's being
[59:54] said it's God's purpose of election not
[1:00:00] so man's free will might stand you hear
[1:00:02] so much in in theological debates people
[1:00:07] exalting man's free will we have to have
[1:00:10] free will we got you know man has free
[1:00:12] will
[1:00:13] what about God's free will does anybody
[1:00:16] care about that does anybody concerned
[1:00:19] about God accomplishing his purpose
[1:00:21] now people people make a god after their
[1:00:26] own imagination that's what they do and
[1:00:29] they you know they they make God in
[1:00:32] their own image the God that people are
[1:00:35] serving is extremely human no that's not
[1:00:39] how it works
[1:00:40] the God who declares who he is became
[1:00:44] human he wasn't a human God created by
[1:00:48] man in our image
[1:00:50] he has got alone he is perfect he is
[1:00:54] wise he's all-wise he's completely holy
[1:00:57] he's totally different than you and I
[1:01:00] his free will will stand our free will
[1:01:05] has to bow in worship before him so in
[1:01:11] order that God's purpose of election
[1:01:14] might stand verse 12 it was said unto
[1:01:17] her Rebekah the elder shall serve the
[1:01:21] younger as it is written Jacob have I
[1:01:24] loved but Esau have I hated
[1:01:29] God chose Jacob before he was born
[1:01:32] before he did anything God chose to hate
[1:01:36] Esau before he had done any good or any
[1:01:42] evil verse 14 what shall we say then is
[1:01:46] there unrighteousness with God god
[1:01:49] forbid for he saith to Moses I will have
[1:01:52] mercy on whom I will have mercy
[1:01:55] and I will have compassion on whom I
[1:01:57] will have compassion so then it is not
[1:02:00] of him that willeth nor of him that
[1:02:02] runneth but of God that showeth mercy I
[1:02:06] think I mentioned this before but I'll
[1:02:07] repeat it if God people say it's not
[1:02:12] fair that God chooses to have mercy on
[1:02:15] some and chooses not to have mercy on
[1:02:19] others it's a funny statement in my mind
[1:02:23] and it's full of human emotion but
[1:02:28] lacking desperately in any logic
[1:02:31] whatsoever if God is fair would we be
[1:02:36] talking about mercy in the first place
[1:02:38] mercy by definition means that he is
[1:02:41] overriding justice he's overriding
[1:02:46] fairness if God was fair all sinners
[1:02:50] would be sent to the lake of fire God is
[1:02:54] fair God is just but because of his plan
[1:03:01] salvation because of the fact that he is
[1:03:03] a savior he chooses to have mercy on
[1:03:07] some that that's his choice mercy is by
[1:03:13] definition not fair
[1:03:16] mercy He has given as a pardon and
[1:03:19] saying it would be fair for me to
[1:03:22] condemn you to hell but because I love
[1:03:26] you
[1:03:27] I'm having mercy upon you it's not of
[1:03:33] him that willeth you know if it was us
[1:03:35] if it was God's looking and saying you
[1:03:38] know brother Tim Calhoun he's a great
[1:03:40] guy I see he's really nice he's really
[1:03:43] kind to people and therefore I choose
[1:03:45] him to eternal life that would be a
[1:03:49] reward right that would be a reward for
[1:03:53] good behavior but manat it's not a
[1:04:00] reward it's grace its grace and you know
[1:04:04] you know it talks about that in Romans
[1:04:08] chapter 4
[1:04:09] with Abraham will evil turn there yeah
[1:04:24] verse one what shall we say then that
[1:04:27] Abraham our Father as pertaining to the
[1:04:29] flesh hath found or if Abraham were
[1:04:31] justified by works he hath whereof to
[1:04:33] glory but not before God for what saith
[1:04:37] the scripture abraham believed God and
[1:04:40] it was counted unto him for
[1:04:41] righteousness
[1:04:41] now to him that worketh is the reward
[1:04:44] not reckoned of grace but of debt but to
[1:04:47] him that worketh not believed but
[1:04:49] believeth on him that justifieth the
[1:04:51] ungodly his faith is counted for
[1:04:54] righteousness it it's not a debt
[1:04:57] salvation is not a debt that God owes to
[1:05:00] us salvation is mercy if it was a debt
[1:05:06] and it was by works then we would have a
[1:05:09] reason to boast but we don't we don't we
[1:05:13] all know that we don't have a reason to
[1:05:14] boast and and very very basic rules of
[1:05:19] Justice means if a person is a good
[1:05:22] person but commits a murder
[1:05:23] you're not trying him for being a good
[1:05:25] person and murder you're trying him for
[1:05:28] murder that's it and so when we break
[1:05:31] God's laws which the fact is we do every
[1:05:35] day we still do every day we are worthy
[1:05:40] of the punishment that God set forth
[1:05:42] which was in the beginning death but God
[1:05:47] pardons us but God gives us mercy so
[1:05:51] back to Roman's 916 which we read I'm
[1:05:56] gonna read a quote before we go to verse
[1:05:59] 17 from who is this Melchizedek brother
[1:06:03] branham says and remember you your eyes
[1:06:05] your stature whatever you was you're in
[1:06:07] his thinking at the beginning and the
[1:06:09] only thing that you are is the
[1:06:11] expression word after he thought he
[1:06:14] spoke it and here you are if it isn't if
[1:06:16] he wasn't in his thinking there's no way
[1:06:18] at all for you to ever be there for he
[1:06:20] is the one that
[1:06:21] give its eternal life you remember how
[1:06:23] we read the scriptures not him that
[1:06:25] willeth or him that runneth but God and
[1:06:27] that his predestination might stand true
[1:06:29] he could choose before any time who God
[1:06:32] is sovereign in his choosing did you
[1:06:34] know that God is sovereign
[1:06:35] alright then on to verse 17 for the
[1:06:39] scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for
[1:06:41] this same purpose have I raised thee up
[1:06:43] that I might show my power in thee and
[1:06:45] that my name might be declared
[1:06:47] throughout all the earth therefore hath
[1:06:51] he mercy on whom he will have mercy and
[1:06:53] whom he will he hardens so really both
[1:07:01] sides are predestinated double what they
[1:07:06] call it double predestination or double
[1:07:09] the election both sides he's chosen some
[1:07:14] to receive mercy he's chosen some many
[1:07:19] most to receive condemnation now we'll
[1:07:26] say verse 19 now will say unto me wide I
[1:07:29] think yet find fault for who has
[1:07:31] resisted his will nay but o man who art
[1:07:35] thou that repliest against God shall the
[1:07:37] thing formed say to him that formed it
[1:07:39] why hast thou made me thus hath not the
[1:07:43] Potter power over the clay of the same
[1:07:45] lump to make one vessel unto honour and
[1:07:47] another unto dishonour what if God
[1:07:50] willing to show his wrath and to make
[1:07:52] his power known endured with much
[1:07:54] long-suffering the vessels of Wrath
[1:07:57] fitted to discretion destruction and
[1:07:59] that he might make known the riches of
[1:08:01] his glory on the vessels of Mercy which
[1:08:04] he had a for prepared unto glory
[1:08:08] so God ordains vessels of Wrath and he
[1:08:13] ordains vessels of mercy why does he do
[1:08:18] that because he's willing to do it
[1:08:22] that's what it says
[1:08:23] God willing to show his wrath it's God's
[1:08:28] purpose to reveal the nature the
[1:08:32] attribute that he has of Wrath
[1:08:35] it's also God's purpose to reveal the
[1:08:38] nature that he has of mercy and we have
[1:08:43] to have we have the to juxtapose against
[1:08:46] one another because one reveals the
[1:08:49] other without wrath we don't understand
[1:08:52] mercy without wrath we don't understand
[1:08:55] love these both of these things have to
[1:08:59] be there for us to really know who God
[1:09:04] is and what he's done for us otherwise
[1:09:07] his purpose to reveal himself as a
[1:09:09] savior is almost meaningless it's not
[1:09:13] understandable we spoke about this
[1:09:16] earlier but I'm gonna read the quote now
[1:09:18] the eternal thoughts of God let me ask
[1:09:20] you are the thoughts of God eternal this
[1:09:23] is from the church ages book if you can
[1:09:25] see this you will see many things God is
[1:09:27] unchangeable in both essence and
[1:09:29] behavior we have studied that and proven
[1:09:31] that already God is infinite in his
[1:09:34] abilities so therefore he must he as God
[1:09:37] must be omniscient if he's omniscient
[1:09:39] then he's not now learning nor is he
[1:09:42] taking counsel even with himself nor is
[1:09:44] he at any time adding to his knowledge
[1:09:46] if he can add to his knowledge than he's
[1:09:48] not omniscient the best we could say
[1:09:50] that it that is that some time he will
[1:09:53] be but that is not scriptural he is
[1:09:54] omniscient he has never had a new
[1:09:56] thought about anything because all his
[1:09:58] thoughts he has always had and always
[1:09:59] will have and knows the end from the
[1:10:02] beginning because he's God thus the
[1:10:04] thoughts of God are eternal they are
[1:10:06] real they're not simply like a man with
[1:10:08] the blueprint he has drawn up in which
[1:10:11] one day will be translated into
[1:10:12] substance and form but they are already
[1:10:15] real and eternal and part of God what a
[1:10:21] beautiful beautiful statement John 6:44
[1:10:31] no man can come to me except the Father
[1:10:34] which has sent me draw him and I will
[1:10:37] raise him up at the last day that always
[1:10:41] amazes me he starts that sentence was
[1:10:44] such a really a negative thought
[1:10:48] no man can come to me take that in for a
[1:10:52] minute we roll that roll over that -
[1:10:55] unless they drop unless we're drawn but
[1:10:57] what about the hopelessness of that
[1:10:59] first statement no man can come to me
[1:11:03] you in your ability you you and your
[1:11:07] choosing you and your desires would not
[1:11:11] come to him you wouldn't desire him you
[1:11:17] it's it's our nature that were born with
[1:11:19] - not like God to hate God you say well
[1:11:26] I was predestinated see that was in his
[1:11:27] mind the scripture in Romans three read
[1:11:32] through Romans three is very clear we we
[1:11:36] don't by nature born in this world love
[1:11:39] God we by nature reject him turn from
[1:11:43] him run from him it disobey him at every
[1:11:48] chance that we possibly can we are born
[1:11:51] rebels but it takes this what is it
[1:11:56] what's the exception how can people come
[1:11:59] to him the father which I sent me draw
[1:12:03] him said it before but I'll repeat it
[1:12:06] again this word in the Greek literally
[1:12:10] means to drag it's not just come here
[1:12:15] and we say okay it's grab you by the ear
[1:12:18] and say I'm dragging you I'm opening
[1:12:24] your heart and your mind so you can do
[1:12:26] nothing else all you can do is hear and
[1:12:29] receive this word so if the father
[1:12:34] doesn't drag us to Christ we won't come
[1:12:39] to him
[1:12:41] we won't it has to be him exerting his
[1:12:47] grace upon us
[1:12:53] John 15 verse 16 you have not chosen me
[1:13:00] but I have chosen you and ordained you
[1:13:04] that you should go and bring forth fruit
[1:13:07] and that your fruit should remain that
[1:13:09] whatsoever you shall ask of the Father
[1:13:11] in my name he may give it so beautiful.i
[1:13:16] we didn't choose him wasn't our choosing
[1:13:19] wasn't our desire it was his choice of
[1:13:23] us just look at how Jesus brought his
[1:13:27] disciples to himself were they running
[1:13:29] to sign up with him
[1:13:32] no one was running to sign up with Jesus
[1:13:36] did he just put a sign up and everyone
[1:13:38] came he went to them and in one way or
[1:13:42] another he manifested himself to them
[1:13:44] and when he said follow me it was like I
[1:13:47] couldn't do anything else
[1:13:49] how do something else from what I what
[1:13:52] you've shown me how can I do how can I
[1:13:55] do anything other and even when he tried
[1:13:59] to send him away in John 6 which we read
[1:14:02] he he told the people unless you eat my
[1:14:07] flesh and drink my blood you have no
[1:14:08] life in you everybody was equally
[1:14:12] confused and when they asked him they
[1:14:17] tried to clarify that by saying well our
[1:14:20] fathers ate manna in the wilderness and
[1:14:22] so we know this is a parable that you're
[1:14:25] just telling it you know like it's like
[1:14:27] a spiritual thing and Jesus says very
[1:14:31] truly truly I say to you unless you eat
[1:14:35] my flesh and drink my blood you have no
[1:14:38] life into you in other words he's saying
[1:14:40] no I'm not gonna explain a thing to you
[1:14:42] and he comes to everybody leaves him he
[1:14:48] comes to his twelve and he says will you
[1:14:51] go you want to go to there's the door
[1:14:54] everybody you're welcome to walk through
[1:14:56] it and Peter the spokesmen rise up it
[1:15:00] says who - who would we go he didn't say
[1:15:03] where would we go
[1:15:05] isn't that beautiful - whoo it's a
[1:15:08] person he's a person that we're
[1:15:11] following it's the same today he's a
[1:15:14] person that we're following to whom
[1:15:16] would we go you and you alone have the
[1:15:19] words of eternal life they didn't have
[1:15:22] the explanation of it he didn't come and
[1:15:25] bring him us like other times where he
[1:15:27] come and explain the parable to him
[1:15:29] this time he didn't explain it he just
[1:15:31] said you want to go they said who would
[1:15:37] we go to why he were the heat they were
[1:15:42] the ones that he manifested his name
[1:15:44] unto because the father gave them to him
[1:15:47] and even one of them was a devil Jesus
[1:15:49] said
[1:16:00] let's look at Jude chapter 1 and verse 4
[1:16:22] for there are certain men crept in
[1:16:26] unawares who were before of old ordained
[1:16:31] to this condemnation ungodly men turning
[1:16:33] the grace of our God into lasciviousness
[1:16:36] and denying the only Lord God and our
[1:16:41] Lord Jesus Christ so what did it start
[1:16:45] with started with the fact that they
[1:16:47] were ordained to condemnation they were
[1:16:50] ordained to be condemned so as a result
[1:16:54] of being ordained to be condemned when
[1:16:56] they were confront they're confronted
[1:16:58] with the word what do they do well some
[1:17:04] people look like they're receiving it
[1:17:06] because it says that these people crept
[1:17:09] in unawares they came in they looked
[1:17:14] like they were fish they looked like
[1:17:18] they were good fish they weren't good
[1:17:20] fish remember the parable of the wheat
[1:17:24] and the tares let them grow together
[1:17:26] until the harvest so they crept in
[1:17:31] unawares what are they what do they do
[1:17:34] with the Word of God they turn it into
[1:17:40] lasciviousness they turned god's grenade
[1:17:43] they take God's grace and they make it
[1:17:46] what a disgrace
[1:17:47] they take God's grace and they say we
[1:17:49] can do anything we want to and that's
[1:17:51] true but what is the anything you want
[1:17:54] to its live like the world then you
[1:17:58] don't have the Holy Ghost it's look the
[1:18:00] whole if you have the Holy Ghost you do
[1:18:01] whatever you want to and it reflects the
[1:18:03] righteousness of God and so these people
[1:18:06] they take the word and they pervert it
[1:18:09] into a license to do whatever sinful
[1:18:13] behavior that they want to what hour are
[1:18:16] we living in Laodicea there's the
[1:18:21] there's the true church and the false
[1:18:23] church false church puts him out kicks
[1:18:27] him out
[1:18:27] they're rich increased in goods and have
[1:18:30] need of nothing but don't know they're
[1:18:33] poor blind
[1:18:34] and naked and and they don't it says
[1:18:40] denying the only Lord God and our Lord
[1:18:43] Jesus Christ but it says they're a part
[1:18:47] of the church so ultimately by their
[1:18:52] lifestyle by the life that they're
[1:18:54] leading what are they doing denying God
[1:18:57] denying Jesus Christ it's not that they
[1:19:00] say Jesus isn't Lord they say that
[1:19:05] who's the ones that are saved at the end
[1:19:08] Matthew 7 says he that does the will of
[1:19:11] my father not all that say to me Lord
[1:19:14] Lord shall enter the kingdom but he that
[1:19:18] does the will of my father how do we
[1:19:21] know the will of his father of his word
[1:19:23] he that does and keeps the word Jesus
[1:19:27] says that over and over again if you
[1:19:29] love me keep my Commandments and thank
[1:19:33] God we don't have to keep his
[1:19:34] Commandments in our own power but it's
[1:19:37] by that Holy Ghost that he gives to us
[1:19:39] that enables us to keep his word he
[1:19:43] places that love for him inside of you
[1:19:47] you know the scripture says blessed are
[1:19:50] you when you hunger and thirst for
[1:19:54] righteousness for you shall be filled
[1:19:58] well scripturally you can't do that as
[1:20:02] an unregenerate person you can't do that
[1:20:06] unless God has placed that desire inside
[1:20:10] of you so if you have a desire for him
[1:20:13] it shows that he's calling you might not
[1:20:18] be living the way you should but that
[1:20:20] desire inside of you is calling you to
[1:20:24] live the way you should and that desire
[1:20:28] will lead to the power to live the way
[1:20:31] you should but there are some there
[1:20:35] ordained they might hear hear they hear
[1:20:38] the word they even respond to the word
[1:20:40] but they're ordained to condemnation
[1:20:43] they're ordained to be what
[1:20:49] not wheat but tears the rain falls and
[1:20:55] they rejoice they're there amongst them
[1:20:58] amongst amongst the church but they're
[1:21:00] ordained to condemnation 2nd Peter
[1:21:04] chapter 3 and verse 9 the Lord is not
[1:21:21] slack concerning his promise as some men
[1:21:23] count slackness but is long-suffering to
[1:21:25] us-ward not willing that any should
[1:21:29] perish but all should come to repentance
[1:21:33] oh boy now you got a contradiction
[1:21:37] brother Jason well let's read it let's
[1:21:42] read it again the Lord is not slack
[1:21:46] concerning his promise no problem as
[1:21:49] some men count slackness but is
[1:21:51] long-suffering - who what us word who
[1:21:57] that who's he writing to LeBron James
[1:22:06] the the Egyptian government
[1:22:08] maybe it's the American government no
[1:22:12] he's not writing to them he's writing to
[1:22:15] Saints so God is he's not slack
[1:22:20] concerning his promise to us word
[1:22:24] doesn't have a promise to the world does
[1:22:27] it have promise to those who are deigned
[1:22:29] to condemnation he has a promise to his
[1:22:32] elect and he's not slack he's not late
[1:22:36] he's always on time
[1:22:39] he's not willing that any should perish
[1:22:42] while he's ordained some to condemnation
[1:22:44] but he sought not ordained any of the
[1:22:47] elected Bride of Christ to condemnation
[1:22:50] none of us will perish he's giving us
[1:22:53] all space to repent but that all should
[1:22:55] come to repentance who's going to come
[1:22:58] to repentance
[1:23:00] the people that are ordained a
[1:23:02] condemnation know the predestinated seed
[1:23:07] that were chosen in him before the
[1:23:09] foundation of the world they will hear
[1:23:11] they will come to pre penance in in the
[1:23:20] sermon influenced 1963 where the Branham
[1:23:24] said God will take his anointed and you
[1:23:25] cannot impersonate that office God
[1:23:28] anoints he chooses who he wills he
[1:23:31] condemns who He wills it's God that does
[1:23:33] the justifying it's God that does the
[1:23:35] choosing and he raises it up God
[1:23:38] condemns who he wills has mercy on whom
[1:23:40] He wills Ephesians 1:13 through 14 in
[1:23:51] whom he also trusted after that ye heard
[1:23:53] the word of truth the gospel of your
[1:23:55] salvation in whom also after that he
[1:23:57] believed you were sealed with that Holy
[1:23:59] Spirit of promise which is the earnest
[1:24:01] of our inheritance until the redemption
[1:24:05] of the purchased possession unto the
[1:24:08] praise of his glory and then he feed his
[1:24:10] 430 and grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[1:24:13] God whereby you're sealed until the day
[1:24:17] of redemption
[1:24:20] we're sealed until the day of redemption
[1:24:22] those ones that he's not slack
[1:24:26] concerning his promise he will see them
[1:24:29] through he sealed them till the day of
[1:24:32] eternal redemption what is the day of
[1:24:33] your redemption so when you get a new
[1:24:35] body then you could then then you'll
[1:24:38] never fail never fall because you're a
[1:24:40] jet you're immortal you can't you can't
[1:24:43] even die it's not even possible and the
[1:24:45] fact is if we understood it correctly in
[1:24:47] this life we cannot die we just passed
[1:24:52] from one form to another
[1:24:57] we shouldn't be uncertain about death
[1:24:59] should we yet somehow we have a fear
[1:25:04] there but we shouldn't be uncertain if
[1:25:07] God has called you if you know who you
[1:25:11] are
[1:25:12] then there's no possum
[1:25:14] that you can lose you no one can pluck
[1:25:19] you out of God's hand no one can take
[1:25:22] you out of can you find someone more
[1:25:25] powerful that can overpower God can you
[1:25:29] find someone more powerful that could
[1:25:31] take you out of his will not even death
[1:25:36] death is just a servant for you and I
[1:25:40] death just passes us from this pest
[1:25:43] house to my father's house so we
[1:25:48] shouldn't we shouldn't be afraid let's
[1:25:50] not be so tied to this world let's not
[1:25:53] be so tied to the stuff of life to our
[1:25:57] plans our ideas what we want let's just
[1:26:01] be let's just get ourselves out of the
[1:26:03] picture say God I belong to you whatever
[1:26:06] you want to do through me and in me let
[1:26:09] it be done I'm not gonna fight anymore
[1:26:11] I'm not gonna resist anymore because
[1:26:14] ultimately you aren't you want to do it
[1:26:17] the hard way
[1:26:18] or you want to do it the easy way do you
[1:26:21] want to surrender now or you do do you
[1:26:24] want God to make you put you to your
[1:26:29] knees we've all we've all been through
[1:26:31] that where we listen right away and it
[1:26:35] was smooth sailing difficulties people
[1:26:38] spoke against us but it just worked and
[1:26:41] we've all I have heard from the Lord and
[1:26:47] it took years for God to break me down
[1:26:52] until I was saying I have mercy I'll do
[1:26:55] it brother branham tells the same
[1:26:58] stories he's subject to the same thing
[1:27:02] he was subject for the same things that
[1:27:04] we were God broke him down and broke him
[1:27:06] down and broke him down Feli was simply
[1:27:08] just a vessel that God just passed
[1:27:11] himself through to the people that's
[1:27:13] what we want to be musicians if you'd
[1:27:15] come
[1:27:21] God is always going to and we read it we
[1:27:27] read it work everything according to the
[1:27:30] counsel of his own will that means even
[1:27:32] the smallest detail of your life the
[1:27:37] smallest thing you're experiencing God
[1:27:40] is intimately involved and he's working
[1:27:43] why don't you just a let yourself see it
[1:27:47] that way
[1:27:47] why don't you let yourself believe that
[1:27:51] God is in that control I mean think
[1:27:52] about I always go back to what I was
[1:27:54] talking about in Sunday school I look at
[1:27:57] the life of Jesus and he was there
[1:27:58] standing before Pilate and it's just
[1:28:02] astounding to me how aware he was of the
[1:28:07] father's hand and power in his life and
[1:28:10] how he stood he stood there and he says
[1:28:13] don't you Pilate says don't you know I
[1:28:15] have power over you says you wouldn't
[1:28:19] have any authority over me unless it was
[1:28:22] given you from above and I think we we
[1:28:27] need to remember that in our lives God
[1:28:30] is in control whatever situation we find
[1:28:32] ourselves in if you're a Christian if
[1:28:35] you're a believer God is right there
[1:28:38] he's he's ordained every fiber of the
[1:28:43] situation that you're in see him see his
[1:28:47] purpose see his plan but don't just see
[1:28:51] it as a fatalist see it as God is
[1:28:54] working in me God is using and using me
[1:28:58] in this situation it's not just you're
[1:29:01] not an active participant the Bible says
[1:29:05] we're participators together with God
[1:29:09] he wants to work and you let him do it
[1:29:13] and then let's stand up let's pray
[1:29:20] Heavenly Father we love you so much Lord
[1:29:26] we want we want to see you more we want
[1:29:30] these truths not just to be words on
[1:29:32] pages that make us feel good Lord but we
[1:29:37] want these things to be just ingrained
[1:29:41] in our very soul so that we understand
[1:29:45] your sovereignty understand your hand in
[1:29:48] our life that we see every situation and
[1:29:52] we can live with a calm assurance and
[1:29:58] peace and rest this world wants to get
[1:30:02] us so worked up
[1:30:04] so upset but let this reveal truth Lord
[1:30:11] pour into each one's soul Lord that we
[1:30:18] could take courage that we could find
[1:30:20] strength that we could find that peace
[1:30:24] which passes all understanding Lord we
[1:30:28] love you we asked Lord as we turn to a
[1:30:31] time of prayer and worship that you
[1:30:36] would just come and inhabit the prayers

[1:42:07] 48 hours before just taking many of the
[1:42:10] questions right out of our out of our
[1:42:12] control which was so much of a blessing
[1:42:15] and just come down in every every little
[1:42:18] thing that was just too numerous to go
[1:42:21] into he is just right on time my ears
[1:42:42] are clogged up so don't talk any y'all
[1:42:48] know I had to go in the hospital some
[1:42:50] time ago yeah I'll start with a cold and
