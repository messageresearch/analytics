great honor and responsibility and a great opportunity and so we um but you know um if we could there's things that we could say and you know there's uh things that God has dealt with us and put on our hearts but how many would just like for the Lord to speak tonight and amen I I I believe that one word from him would make all the difference so amen let's just bow our hearts together and look to him now you pray amen let's just ask God to come Among Us Lord Jesus Lord we just thank you for this privilege and opportunity to come and gather with your children and Lord I look across this audience and I see Believers and Lord I I look at the young people Lord and and Lord I I see that there a they're a product of the message that You' have sent to us in this this this end time and Lord we're so thankful God that we we know Lord that your word can never return unto your Void but it has to accomplish the thing that you sent it to do and Lord I believe that you sent this message to us to to give a bride rapturing faith and rapturing Grace in this hour and Lord a message to turn our hearts back and Lord we're so thankful God that Lord I'm looking at at some people that are the they have received that message and Lord as they have received that message they have received the benefits of that message and so God we're just asking tonight that you would just come now and Lord we're surrendering our hearts to you we're giving our Lord the the gift that we have Lord we just Lord we know it's your gift and and Lord there's nothing special about us and so God we're we're realizing that tonight and we're very conscious of our of our littleness and so God we just ask Lord that as we humble oursel in your presence that you would just come and Lord that you would begin to speak and you would begin to minister Lord because Lord that would make all the difference here tonight and Lord I pray that Lord that you would just begin to walk up and down the Avenues of the hearts and Lord discern the needs that Lord we don't know what the needs may be but you know all things you're the omniscient God and so God we're just asking that you just come in a special way now Lord speak to your children through your word and Lord we'll give you all the thanks and all the praise for we ask it in Jesus precious name amen amen amen amen I don't know um I'm going to try my best to not use that because it's kind of cutting out but amen if you can keep that where it's at right now that'll be just fine and so uh we we do greet you in the name of the Lord tonight how many has enjoyed the services so far amen we appreciate our brother Andrew and um I tell you I'm glad that uh that God still got some men that he can put his hands on and that'll preach the word with you know the way that the I I believe that that God sent us a message and it don't need to be dressed up and prettied up and amen you're the generation amen I'll just ask you tonight as a as as this this fresh generation amen do you want a watered down version of the message of the hour amen do you want something do you want something that's you know watered down and fixed up and amen or do you just want it the way God said it amen how many would say that I just want it the way God said it the way that God sent it that's good enough for me and I believe that's what we've heard preached here the last couple nights and so we certainly appreciate the word of God if you have your Bible we'll just turn to the book of Acts in the 20th chapter I know I don't have to tell you that I'm a little bit nervous but uh I'm a nervous person I'm always nervous and so when I get behind the pull pit I'm ex extremely nervous and uh but you know as I said we um we just count it such a an honor to be here we appreciate brother Jason brother Matt and all the ministry here for giving us this opportunity tonight Acts chapter 20 and verse 18 and I also want to read from one place and uh 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter we'll start here in Acts chap 20 and the 18th verse and when they were come to him he said unto them you know from the first day that I came to Asia after what Manner I have been with you at all seasons serving the Lord with all humility of mine with many tears and temptations which befel me by the laying in weight of the Jews and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have showed you and have have taught you publicly from and from house to house testifying both to the Jews and also to the Greeks repentance toward God and Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ and now behold I go Bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there save that the Holy Ghost witnessed in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me but none of these things move me neither count I my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God 1 Corinthians 15 and verse 58 yeah the Apostle Paul writing here which is the same one that we were reading about in Acts 20 1 Corinthians 15 and 58 and he writes therefore my beloved Brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord may God add His blessings as you're seated tonight get rid of this if I can thank you brother I want to speak to you for the next few minutes by the help of God I want to thank Daniel Cross for this beautiful pull pit that I can't fit all my notes on so thank you brother he probably did that hoping that it would help uh shorten the service but amen but you know we're we're just going to amen how many wants the Holy Spirit to have his way tonight amen I want to speak to you just for the next few minutes on uh out of Acts 20 there in the 24th verse where Paul says but none of these things move me none of these things move me in the Book of Psalms in the 16th chapter in the 7th verse David said I Will Bless The Lord who hath given me counsel my Reigns also instruct me in the night season he said I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved amen I have set the Lord before me and because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved that word there in the Hebrew it means to to totter or to shake or to slip or to be shaken or to be moved or to be overthrown so David is saying I have set the Lord before me he said and because he's at my right hand I shall not be shaken I shall not slip I shall not be overthrown amen and so I believe that if if David uh said that uh that there in the Old Testament how many believes that that we can also set the Lord before us amen and I believe that if we set the Lord before us even as brother Barry was sharing this morning about always being conscious of the Holy Spirit and and how that we would walk and and we never want to grieve the Holy Spirit and see amen I believe that that that's so important for us to to put the Lord before us at all times amen but David said because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved or I shall not totter or slip or or be shaken now in the message the absolute brother B would say and what the Christians need today is in this atomic age and in this time of uncertainty you need something besides just an experience of joining Church how many can say Amen to that you need an anchor see an absolute to know because churches will fail and people will fail but Christ cannot fail amen he's the he's the absolute to the believer amen and Christ is your absolute you're tied to him and he's your absolute and you're tied to him see then you're tied to the word he said now that this tells whether or not you got the right absolute see if you can read in the scripture something that Christ has ordained or commissioned us to do and because of some twisting around or someone would tell you that that was for the disciples or somebody else and then you don't hold on to that see then Christ is not your absolute he said amen the person who led you out of the way is your absolute then so in other words the prophet is showing if somebody comes along and and Lead You Away from the word he said then that person has now become your absolute amen because anything that's contrary to the word of God Amen anything that's leading you away from the word of God see amen the prophet of God said if the word is your absolute amen anything that begins to try to lead you away from the word you'll hold on to the word amen listen if it cost you friendships amen if it cost you popularity amen it don't matter what you cost you amen if you're tied to the and the word is your absolute if Christ is your absolute amen you will hold to that word in spite of everything else is that right amen so watch what the prophet said if the word Christ still holds there then he's your absolute and we mustn't let anything stir us out of the way of the word amen as he goes on to say in in another uh uh in another time that he preached the same message same sermon he said now when I was looking this text up he said I somebody uh keep saying you know that's absolute or the truth or it's absolute and this is it and I thought what is that word what does it mean absolute and when I went to the dictionary to find out what it meant Webster said it's perfect within itself it's Unlimited in its power it's primarily an ultimate amen so so see if is Unlimited in his power is perfect within itself now we know that only the word of God is perfect within itself how many can say Amen to that amen only the word so only the word can be our absolute now we know that you know there's all kind of debates and argument well what is the absolute is it is it the Bible or is it but listen friends I'm going tell you every every every denomination out here amen they hold to the Bible and they will hold up a Bible and they will say this is my absolute amen but really and truly in real ity amen what is absolute to you is what has been revealed to you out of that word amen because when the word becomes a revelation in your heart then listen it's not just something that somebody has told you it's not just something that somebody has explained to you or talked you in or convinced you of but when the word becomes an absolute in your heart amen it becomes a revelation to you personally then now it is an absolute to you it's something that your Soul Is Anchored to or di to and nothing can move you off of that is that right amen so the prophet would say he said now every great achievement is tied to an absolute in the day that we're living in now everything is so breaking up and so fragile and so carried away he said and I think that this message would be very appropriate it be a very appropriate thing especially to Christians when they're going through their deep Waters now the Christian church is passing through the deepest water is had for over the last 2,000 years because we're coming to a spot to where there's something presented to Christians something that they're going to have to make a decision on and I think that the Christian Church ought to have something that they know that they are tied to instead of just floating about like a leaf on the water with the wind see the Bible says carried about with every wind of Doctrine the Christian Life ought to be a stable life it should be something that's a principal see that you're tied to that it's more than life itself and you must have something that you're tied to he says he goes on to say he says now certainly the Catholic Church they would take their anchor their Northstar for their achievements and and it it is what whatever the Pope says see it's an infallibility to the Roman Catholic Church in the Protestants they have a bishop or some Creed and their denominational beliefs and so forth amen but you know I feel like Paul amen when he said here I as I'm looking at the scripture in Acts 20 and 24 he said none of these things move me he said amen why for he was anchored he had an absolute he says since I met him out there on the road to Damascus amen he had listen friends I want to tell you Paul didn't meet uh Paul didn't come in contact amen with another Doctrine Paul didn't come in contact with just a better idea Paul met the pillar of fire on the road to Damascus like brother Andrew was preaching to us last night he met amen something in the middle of the road that changed his life amen and it turned him around Paul was on his way to persecute the Christian church is that right amen thinking that he was doing God a service thinking that he was in the will of God Paul was a religious man Paul was a well-taught man he set at the feet of Gia hey Paul knew scripture amen but when he met the pillar of fire amen and a voice begin to speak to him out of that Pillar of Fire amen that changed his life forever and from that that day forward Paul had an absolute hallelujah amen I tell you what friends amen I hope that every person in this building comes in contact with the same Pillar of Fire that Paul met on that road because the prophet of God said that five minutes in the presence of God Amen F he talked about Moses when he met amen when he met God On The Backs side of the desert in the form of a burning bush he said five minutes in God's presence done more for him amen than 40 years of training in Egypt amen 40 Years of theology amen had failed Moses and left him a failure but five minutes in the presence of God changed a man amen it didn't just change Moses but the prophet of God said because one man took God at his word amen it didn't just change a man it changed the whole world at that time because somebody got in the presence of God hallelujah I tell you what it did amen it anchored him to an absolute it tied him to an absolute now the Bible says amen uh in Hebrews chapter 6 verse 16 for men verely swear by the greater and an oath for confirmations is to them an end of all Strife where in God willing more abundantly to show under Under The Heirs of the promise the immutability ility of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it is impossible it is impossible I think this is beautiful it is impossible are you hearing me tonight it is impossible for God to lie amen God cannot lie hallelujah amen that we might have a strong consolation who fled for Refuge to lay hold o upon the hope that is set before us which hope we have is an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entered in with in the veil whether the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made a high priest Forever After the order of mezc watch what Paul is is writing here is showing us here which hope we have for an anchor of What Not Our flesh the anchor is not our for our flesh the anchor is not tied to your spirit amen listen for you ought to be thankful for that tonight cuz there's going to be days in your flesh you going to feel good and there's going to be days that you're not going to feel good you're going to have good days you're going to have bad days you say brother you talking about even somebody born again absolutely even born again Believers have bad days do you realize even Christians get sick as a matter of fact the Bible says many are the afflictions of the righteous so when God saved us and give us the Holy Ghost amen that does not mean that we're not going to ever go through tests and trials and and problems and and troubles and amen and you're going to have disappointments and discouragements and and there's and there's going to be times that you're not at a youth camp and you're not surrounded by a bunch of kids that believe what you believe and and you're not going to have peers amen around you supporting you amen you're not always going to live in a church atmosphere but but you're going to you're going to have bad days you're going to you're going to face disappointments and troubles and and situations let me I'm not trying to paint a real bad picture for you tonight but I'm just telling you a as young people tonight amen the days that lay ahead of you are not all going to be beautiful and sunny and and wonderful and you're going to go through some troubles and some problems and amen just like Paul amen there in Acts 20 amen listen for is from the time he met God on the road to Damascus until the time that that story was being told in the book of Acts he had nothing but trouble Paul was beaten and whipped and threw in prison and even the Christians had a hard time trusting him can you blame them I mean they struggled for a while to accept Paul's Ministry because this is the very man that just a few days before was persecuting them amen Paul amen and the Jews hated him though amen because Paul was one a great man among them at one time and and so it looked like everything had turned against Paul but you know what Paul said he talked about tears many tears he talked about tribulations and and all these things but his testimony was this none of those things move me and he said I don't even know what lays in front of me I don't even know the things that I may have to suffer I don't even know except amen that that God has witnessed by the Holy Ghost amen that that bonds and imprisonment amen is what laying in front of me but do you realize amen Paul amen had already caught a vision and God had already spoke to him that he would go to Jerusalem amen and that he would a vision eventually end up in Rome and he didn't care what it cost him or what he had to go through amen Paul amen was going to be obedient to the heavenly vision and so he said none of these things move me why because he had his soul was tied to something let me tell you your Soul's got to be tied to something and that anchor got to be connected listen I'm glad that it's not connected in on this side in my flesh or or even in my spirit amen because I'm going to tell you the flesh is an Emy with the things of God that's the that's the scripture amen and amen but but that Soul amen the prophet of God said that Soul amen because he talks about the endet of the Flesh and the five senses the endet of the spirit and all those things Satan uses and works in those areas how many knows that's true but in the soul it's either Faith or doubt amen and it's a beautiful thing because amen when when your Soul Is Anchored to the word of God Amen it don't matter what's going on around you amen the prophet would type it with a with a Tabernacle in the wilderness he said see when they was coming in in into the outer courts there amen that was a flesh because remember it was in three uh categories or or three uh uh uh you know there was three uh places there in the Tabernacle the outer Court the inner Court the holies of holies and the probably type that because you're a triun and being amen you're made up of a of a flesh body and then you got a spirit and you got a soul and the man that was in the outer Court was subject to the elments amen there was uh there was sunny days and then there was cloudy days there was sunny days and there was rainy days amen there was all kind of amen and and and because he was subject to those elements amen then the then the the weather could actually impact his amen his experience amen the sunny days and amen uh you know when on the sunny days he was on the mountain the cloudy days he didn't even know if he was a Christian that's what that's what it's like trying to serve God just in a Justified state then you move into the inner court now you're moving into the spirit and and and in that place there's a lampstand and and and there's you know there's a light of the lampstand which is a better Light No Doubt amen but the prophet said even that would get Smoky at times even that would go out at times even that sometimes the smoke would would cloud over the amen over the the light of the lamps amen and you could still amen be impacted amen by but listen friends amen there's another place it's called the holiest of holies Hallelujah which represents the soul that's on the inside of you that part that come from God hallelujah amen that part of you amen that's anchored to Eternity Hallelujah and the light that's in there amen is a light from the pillar of fire itself the very Shan of glory and it never goes out Hallelujah and it's not dependent on any man to keep it burning Hallelujah so if that's where your experiences tonight amen there's nothing that can happen around you that can impact your experience with God hallelujah amen amen if they walk away it will not affect you if your friends leave the message it will not affect you Hallelujah if if the pastor fails you'll still stand if the church fails you'll still stand if everybody walks away you'll still [Applause] stand Hallelujah because you got an anchor you got a tie poost it's connected to your soul anchor behind the veil he said the prop the Prophet said oh I wish the church could see that all the arguments and strife would be over amen that would be the Supreme Court the Northstar Hallelujah the end of all Strife it's the end of all questions listen friends it's the end of all Strife it's the end of all all questions amen you don't you're not you're not here let me tell you something Amen Let Me just preach to you on this point for for just a few minutes amen because listen friends we are not here to vindicate the message or to prove the message or even to figure out what part of the message we can believe what parts Vindicated what parts I feel a little push back so I'm just like brother brother Andrew said last night amen if you don't want me to preach don't push amen cuz I know where I'm standing at tonight and I tell you this amen amen we don't have to prove the message right or wrong the message is already proven the message you believe is already Vindicated Hallelujah and let me just say this I'm not belittling you I'm not diminishing your testimony but I'm going to tell you something very straight tonight the message is the truth whether I believe it or you believe it or anybody else believe it this message don't need my approval this message has God's approval Hallelujah listen you show me any other message show me any other man pick show me one show me a message show me a man that'll stand and preach and take his Bible and open it up and go through the scriptures and when he's at the end of the sermon say stand and say now if I've told you the truth let him come Hallelujah if I if what I said is the truth then God will come and back it up let me tell you some church amen God himself said amen to this message amen and if God Amen the message I want to put my amen with the amen of God and say I believe it ain't nothing but the truth we are not following amen cunningly devis fables tonight we are following a Vindicated word through a Vindicated Prophet that will give a bride rapturing Grace and it will change our bodies the prophet said improving his word he said I'm so glad today in the shifting age that we're living in where you can hardly put confidence in anything how many can say Amen to that listen you can't trust uh news media you can't trust politics you can't trust you can't put your trust in anything he says but we have a kingdom that cannot shift it cannot move it's the unmovable it's not the rock of of jalter it's Amen but our faith can rest solemnly upon the Rock of Ages Upon Jesus Christ the unmovable Rock of Salvation watch what Paul was saying Hebrews 12 Hebrews 12 and 25 you know these scriptures he says see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he ha promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signify the removing of those things that that are shaken of things that are made that th those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire hallelujah amen watch what Paul is saying here amen there's a shaking coming and God saying I'm not going to just shake the Earth I'll shake the heavens and the Earth Hallelujah and he says and everything that can be shaken will be shaken amen but I'm glad that that's not the end of the verse amen because there's some things that cannot be shaken Hallelujah and in this great shaking time when everything amen that is sh that can be shaken will be shaken brother when the dust settles and it's all over amen there's going to be something that's still standing Hallelujah because there's some there's some things that cannot be shaken Hallelujah and and Jesus said Upon This Rock will I build my church amen what rock was he talking about the rock of Revelation and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it glory to God the prophet of God said it shows us two things very clearly the Gates of Hell will be against the Church of the Living God Amen how many can say Amen to that all hell is against this message all hell is against this bride all hell is against these young people but if you're built on the Revelation the divine revelation of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen all hell is against you amen but all heaven is for you and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail Hallelujah because you receive a kingdom that cannot be moved brother R said this is a time to shake people this is a time that God said there come a time that he shook Mount Si one time that there be a shaking again and he said it wouldn't only shake the mountain but he Shake everything that could be moved but did you notice the rest of the scripture but we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved Hallelujah everything that can be shook will be shaken the heavens will shake the Earth will shake heavens and earth will pass away but the word of God will never pass away for Upon This Rock will I build my church Hallelujah amen what is the word of God himself the kingdom the kingdom which is the word of God himself a kingdom that cannot be moved he said it's unshakable brother Barry was speaking about it this morning teach us to pray thy kingdom come is that right amen thy kingdom come amen thy will be done in other words a kingom there's going to be a reflection of thaty Kingdom on the earth amen watch he said the kingdom of God Christ The Mystery of God revealed the kingdom of God is within you amen what what do they say and Jesus say Amen where is this Kingdom where is this Kingdom amen Jesus be listen it don't come with observation amen it's not amen I can't point you to a certain church or a certain location order amen I can't point you to a certain place where is this Kingdom and Jesus made it very real and very plain the kingdom of God is within you amen listen for this by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the kingdom of God is now within the believer Kingdom the kingdom the prophet said he said see we're not a denomination amen we don't belong to a church we don't belong to a system are you with me amen We Don't Belong no he said but they come and ask brother brown one time said what what church you belong to he said I don't well well what denomination you I don't amen he said well what do you belong to a kingdom hallelujah amen I belong to a kingdom amen watch what the prophet of God said he said the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in your own life bringing to pass every promise in this day world's falling apart amen there in 1963 he said friends we are not promised a system we are promised amen what was promised a kingdom how do you get into it by one Spirit we are all baptized into this Kingdom it's the kingdom of God a kingdom of eternal life with an eternal King giving his his Eternal Word with an eternal people predestinated to eternal life how many say I'm a part of that Kingdom tonight the kingdom of God is within you see why all these man-made systems Must Fall not once more I'll shake the world but I'll shake the heavens and those things that cannot be shook amen is what will remain we receive a kingdom receiving a kingdom that cannot be shook or moved that's the kingdom of God not a system not a political will not a denomination amen but a kingdom we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved all these other things are falling apart America's falling apart Europe's falling apart Asia's falling apart the world is falling apart amen but listen for how many has a testimony that Paul had none of these things move me let me tell you something friends it's not just the world out there falling apart religions falling apart churches are falling apart you're living in a day when the church is out there trying to figure out you know what their greatest debates are now or it's whether or not to accept homosexuals or whether or not they're going to let that in there not just in their Church in their Pulpit you can say listen friend amen I I I I'll just tell you this amen amen the you know I don't I don't need a a bunch of jumping up and down and all that but give a good hearty Amen to the word because I'll tell you what a prophet said he said that as as long as there's somebody with enough God in their heart to say Amen no matter who's around them or what their neighbor thinks he said it proves that Jesus Christ is still alive because when the high priest went behind the veil amen noise was a sign of life and they were out there listening amen for the noise of the baell and the pomegranate and they knew if there was some noise coming from behind that Veil that the high priest was still alive let me tell you if noise was a sign of life back there noise is still a sign of life amen let me tell you Church it don't you let no amens ringing out in the house of God bother you tonight it's just a proof that Jesus Christ our high priest is still alive behind the veil Hallelujah as long as somebody has got enough of God in their heart to say Amen Amen to the word of God your amen is a proof that Jesus Christ is still alive Hallelujah with that in mind why don't you just ring out a good amen tonight Hallelujah listen church I'm telling you the world's falling apart churches are falling apart religions falling apart I'm hey I'm going to tell you something I don't even blame them out there they're sick of religion I don't even blame them amen because because people are looking for something that's real and I'm going to tell I'm looking for something that's real me don't give me no powerless bloodless you can have dead religion brother Bram even said God hates a poweress religion you can have it am mean you can have all the all all your theology and amen listen and they're trying to figure out ways to make it more acceptable for uh for more groups and so they'll take the blood out over here and and they'll take this part out over here and they'll take this scripture out over here and they're taking Holiness out and let me tell you the word of God is still the word of God and and everything's falling apart and everything will be shaken but there's something that will remain amen because there's a kingdom that cannot be moved hallelujah amen the prophet of God said all these other things are falling apart but the but the kingdom that you have received cannot be moved how many can say now I have received that Kingdom amen Colossians 1:12 Paul says giving thanks unto the father who has made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints and light who has delivered un us from delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us hallelujah into the kingdom of his dear son amen you've been translated into the kingdom of his dear son hallelujah amen the prophet of God said amen we are right now seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in an eternal Kingdom with an eternal King and we're in his presence where all things are possible there's healing in this Kingdom there's Deliverance in this Kingdom there's Holy Ghost in This Kingdom Hallelujah amen there's joy in this Kingdom there's liberty in this Kingdom you know you know what a kingdom is a kingdom is a place where the will of the king I I is is realized a kingdom is a place where the word of the king is in power that's what a kingdom is you can't have a king om without a king and the prophet said in the church age book he is our King and we are his kingdom a kingdom is a Dominion a kingdom is a place a Dominion where the will of the king is lived Hallelujah where the law of the of the king or the kingdom amen is enforced is that right and we are amen his kingdom his eternal possession watch what the Bible says Revelations 15:3 and they sing the song of Mo or they and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways Thou King of saints how many can say he's my king tonight the the Bible says he's King of Kings Hallelujah and brother B would come along and says amen he's three kings he's King God he's King theophany he's King Jesus listen real amen you know what he just did right there he just showed you that for Jesus Christ to be king over his kingdom he doesn't have to be physically present hallelujah amen because amen he's King word and where the word of the king is there's power Hallelujah listen for he's King theophany tonight amen and you have received the revelation of who is this MDC and listen I'm going tell you something amen when Jesus went down to Hell amen and broke the door off the hinges and ripped the keys off of Satan's neck and conquered hell he did it as king theophany he did not go down there as a flesh man he went down there in a theophany amen as the word and he conquered hell as king theop you know what that's telling me tonight friends he does not have to show up in this building in a physical body to defeat your enemy to deliver you to heal you Hallelujah if the word is is here tonight if Jesus is here in the form of the word if King theophany is here among us every Power of hell is [Applause] Broken Hallelujah do you believe it's the truth the prophet says Church age book again he's dealing with this Revelations 15 and3 he says and they sang the song of Moses the servant of God the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty just and true there says watch what he says do you see it the lamb the lamb the high priest holding his blood as an atonement Over The Mercy Seat for our sins is the Lord God Almighty that's his present office that's what he's doing right now putting the blood for our sins but one day the lamb will become the lion of the tribe of Judah he will come for forth in the power and glory and take his his authority to reign as king he is is the coming king of this Earth of course that does not say he is not King now for he is our king king of saints right now it is a spiritual Kingdom hallelujah it's not of this world system even as we are not of the world can you say Amen we are not of this world Jesus said amen they are not of the world even as I am not of the world that's why friends you ought to look different you ought to talk different you ought to dress different our church services ought to be different our worship ought to be different amen God did not call us to this message to pattern ourself amen after a denominational Church come on Friends amen we are not here Amen to be the next form of entertainment amen no we are called out we have received a message come out of her my people that you that you be our partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plx hallelujah amen listen I might as well just go Ahad and say it tonight amen our singing ought to be different amen Our Praise ought to be different amen everything that we do ought to be different and I tell you what friends amen there ain't nobody Hallelujah you are not here to compare yourself with that out there because as far as Hollywood is concerned we ain't no match for what they got but as far as God is concerned there ain't nobody that can worship God like the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah there ain't nobody that can play the music like The Bride there ain't nobody that can sing like the bride there ain't nobody that can preach like the preachers that's been called to this [Applause] message we are not of the [Applause] world the prophet of God said our citizenship is in heaven we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth where Jesus is the king Hallelujah that's why our women don't dress in men's clothing or cut their hair or use the cosmetics and the things that the world like so much that's why our men don't drink and smoke and carry on in sin our Dominion is a dominion over sin and it's enforced to the power that's in the spirit of Christ that dwells in us every Kingdom on Earth is going to be torn down but ours will remain Hallelujah that's why you that's why you girls let your hair grow listen brother Jason told me heck all night he took a 5our in I probably shouldn't have told him that on him but he's back there taking yeah he offered me one somebody said please don't but listen amen you know I was reading I've been going through John at home and I was reading over there where in John 18 they come to take Jesus and and and Peter you know because Peter he'd already told the Lord I'll die I'll never I'll I'll die before I I I'll leave your side Jesus said you're going to deny me three times before the end of the night jerked out his sword cut the uh servant of the high priest ear off and brother Bown comes along he says see he said he knew how to duel with the sword but when it come to real Christian Courage he didn't have none at all let me just tell you something there's a lot of people can get in quote battles and there's a lot of people can debate and there's a lot of people that that can get they know how to deal with the sword but when it comes to real Christian Courage to take that word and live it to take it in your school to walk in Walmart come on church I'm going to ask you a question tonight who you figures got the most courage some preacher that knows a bunch of quotes and can argue and debate and fight amen or one of these girls with their long hair and their long dress that ain't as shame to walk in Walmart or a Schoolhouse Hallelujah I believe I'm looking at some young people that's got some courage amen not just to D and debate the word but to act take this message in 2023 when it's the most unpopular when the world don't agree with you when our everything else is against you but none of these things move you because you're anchored to an absolute Hallelujah you're a part of a kingdom with a king glory to God

different no he sleeps with the rest of he eats what they eat he works in the same field well what's the difference over in the Homeland his daddy is a king and it don't matter where he is or what his circumstances or what surrounds him he conducts him himself as a son of a king Hallelujah let me tell you something that's why listen you're under the influence of the kingdom of your birth not your first one you're right one amen when you were born again the way you should have been born the first time amen amen and you're reflecting the kingdom of your birth amen and listen friend amen and you know what that's why amen it don't matter where you're at the culture of the kingdom is not in a in a in a land or a geographical location that's why you ain't got to go listen you don't have to go to Mexico to eat Mexican food you know why because there's Hispanic people that live here and they have the culture and they had the food come on friends you ain't got to go to China to eat Chinese you know cuz there's there's there's Asian people that live here and the culture is in them and you ain't got to go to heaven to see a Christian you ain't got to go to heaven to see Sons and Daughters of God because the culture is in you the kingdom is in you Hallelujah and you are here tonight reflecting the kingdom of your birth Hallelujah and listen friends Jesus Christ has coming to this Earth as

Shepherd a Shepherd loves a sheep listen friends power without character satanic we know this I I can't preach all night but but listen there was some people David didn't go straight to the throne and matter of fact he was not accepted he was rejected let me tell you something right now Jesus Christ is King he's not going to be one day he is right now but right now he's rejected King this world has rejected him this lay out of C and H has put him out come on friends that's your Bible he's been put out of the church he's a rejected King but there were some gentiles the Bible calls them distressed and indebted amen they it was all they there was a rugged bunch of people but they begin to gather themselves around David you know why CU they recognize the anointing that laid on him and they didn't wait for the day that he took the throne to declare him as their King David was their King even when he was rejected just like Jesus listen friend just like Jesus Christ is your king even as rejected King and one day they was out there in a battle and some of them guys got to fight and David just kind of you know he just kind of said something he didn't he wasn't giving no command he just kind of

Gentile Warriors that had gathered around him amen that had already recognized his anointing amen they heard that whisper coming out of their King's mouth and the king's desire become their command and they got Anointed with the king's desire listen amen I'm going to tell you something tonight he was nobody making them do it they just knew the king wanted it and they said if the king wants it I'm going to give it to him I don't care what I got to do how hard I got to fight if my king wants a drink I'm going to give him a drink and I can hear a prophet say oh is there any Mighty Gentile Warriors that that'll come and stand by my side Jesus wants a coold fresh drink of Pentecostal water tonight amen my king wants some praise my king wants some worship he wants a clean drink coming out of a clean heart and I want to tell you something tonight I don't care what I got to do I'm ready to draw my sword cut through every complex every and give my king what he wants Hallelujah well I feel

fight Hallelujah and give him what he desires and listen it ain't just a shouting Church you live the way you live because it's his desire don't try to serve God out of legalism you'll never do it but if it ever becomes a love affair between you and Jesus and you ain't trying to live right amen May because of some command or some rule Amen to work your way into heaven but you know that's what Jesus wants and that's how he wants me to dress and that's how he wants me to live amen if that's what he wants that's what I'm going to do Hallelujah if that's it and you become Anointed with the desire of the king Hallelujah friends I tell you that'll do what legalism has failed to do amen when it becomes a love affair in your heart I should have bed a uh I should have bored a timer can you give me just a few more minutes listen amen the psalm the psalmist writes in Psalms 46 God is our refuge and our strength of very present help and trouble therefore we will not fear though our heart be though or sorry though the Earth be removed and though the mount be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof amen there is a river Hallelujah whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved let me tell you something tonight that That's What Makes You Different that's what set you apart from any other youth group it's not your sincerity I me listen friends we got to be sincere not saying it's not I'm just telling you this brother Bown said Israel was just another Nation you take God you separate Israel from God they were just another Nation he said you take the holy ghost out of the church it's just a it's just a it's just another building with God's name attached to it take the spirit of God out of your life amen you're just like anybody else he said you take the the Holy Ghost off of Samson he was just another man is that right what makes you different is God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved the Heathen rage the kingdoms are moved he uttered his voice the Earth melted the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge you believe it tonight I'm just going to turn a corner real quickly for the next few minutes because I preached a long time showing you how that we cannot be moved we will not be moved but I want to tell you there is something that will move a real believer a little while back a brother shared something with me I thought was powerful it's actually sermon notes from brother brandham and I believe that it was uh published by brother George Smith maybe years ago but the sermon notes um brother Brown writes this notice him Elijah in the cave he said the Oneness storm Billy Graham the uh he said the one is Storm rather that's the first part Billy Graham the Earth shaking C campaigns or Roberts the Pentecostal rushing wind never moved the prophet he said they were only effects of his passing by but what attracted the Prophet Elijah it was the glory of his voice word revealing his glory plans the prophet waited on his office seat notice a type not long then to the rapture he was only near in the wind and in the earthquake and in the fire but the man of God waited for the manifested reality Vindicated word abiding Glory brother bham is actually referring to the scripture there Amen in in First Kings 19 of course but watch what brother B would say in the message what hearest thou Elijah he said listen brother you might have a lot of noise but I wonder how much spirit is behind it see that's what what I'm wondering it it isn't the noise that makes the spirit see I've seen people that could jump and run and shout and play bands and run up and down the platform and didn't have enough real true Faith to stop a toothache but see it's that still small voice of God that operates the power of God that makes the real amen makes things real and brings life to the church that's what I'm speaking of it ain't the noise that counts it's the Vindication the spirit of God that makes the difference it's been here night each night performing signs and wonders and miracles among the people it's true he said I don't see how these Pentecostal people who claim to have kissed the cup of the golden blessings of Jesus Christ can sit still hardly when the Holy Ghost is moving in such things because it ain't got no noise behind the SE the noise went first then the still Small Voice amen we've had those things it was all God's way listen now and listen close God was attracting the attention of Elijah Elijah represents the church he was making him listen but now when the time come for the voice to speak that's something in our heart Hallelujah he said some time ago I seen a picture in Germany called the cloud picture he said it looks horrible when you look at it it looks like a big mess of clouds and he said he says all all these clouds wated together it looks like a horrible thing but when you get closer to it the closer you get you find out it ain't clouds it's angel's wings beaten together rejoicing the Praises of God and you've seen the Pentecostal experience and you looked at it from afar off and you say oh listen at that and all this and the Thunders and the rushing winds but if you'll just get close to it and get in into it you'll find out the closer you get the more real it becomes and that still small voice of God brings out the Angelic part of God and speaks to his people it's not as rough as it looks amen it's the glory of God but you're standing off looking at it amen you see what brother Bram is saying he's talking about all the commotion and and all of the noise and the rejoicing there ain't nothing wrong with it brother B ain't trying to do away with that he's just saying look that's not what moved the prophet amen listen that's not what that's not what's going to move you to a true experience he said but listen if you stand a far off and look at it all you're going to see is the noise and the excitement and you're going to look at it and say that's just a workup and that's just a motion he said but if you'll get close enough and get in [Music] it then you'll hear the still small voice of God speaking to your heart and then you begin to realize wait a minute this ain't a motion this ain't a workup this is God speaking to my heart Hallelujah and listen re in all the noise and in all the rejoicing in all the excitement you've got to hear the still small voice he said that's what moved the prophet that's what moved the prophet that's what'll move the bride let me tell you something friends it's not that we're un unmovable we cannot be moved off the word is that right amen we can't be moved off the word and that but there's but there is something that will move move this bride amen is the Holy Spirit by the word I prove it to you amen because a amen how many remembers amen that the that the Holy Spirit sposed to the prophet pick up your pin and write and as he's writing that remember he said the bride will have thus sayith the Lord or she'll keep still is that what he said the bride will have thus said the Lord or she'll keep still in other words she's not going to be moved by everything she's not going to be moved by every little new doctrine that rises up amen the latest greatest amen Revelation that comes along that's not going to move the real bride amen she's going to have th say the Lord or she'll stand still can I show it to you in the scripture second Samuel 523 and when David inquired of the Lord he said Thou shalt not go up but fet a compass behind them and come upon them over against the mberry trees now David is getting listen the enemy has come to fight against Israel and no doubt amen amen the Army is wan to stand their ground they're wanting to go and fight they're wanting to defend the land amen they're want listen friends and they're no doubt looking back and they're say it's ours it's been given to us by promise amen and all these things but David say we're not going to we're not going to move an inch until we first inquire of the Lord yes and God said don't go down move around amen and and fetch a compass behind them and come over against him in the mberry trees and let it be when thou hearest the sound of the going in the top of the mberry trees amen then that then Thou shalt bester thyself for then shall the Lord go out before thee to Smite the host of the Philistines and David did so as the Lord had commanded him and he smok the Philistines hallelujah amen the prophet said in the message absolute again he said said how David when he was going to battle and the opposition was great and David laid under the tree and sweated out until he heard the sound going through the mberry bushes then it was different David Rose up and went out because he had an absolute he knew that God was going before him Hallelujah they come along and said I'm I'm I'm I'm closing but David but they come along could you imagine they come along ask David David what's your battle plan what's your battle plan David you mighty warrior I mean Saul has killed his thousands David his tens thousands you know you mighty what David what's your battle plan well I'm just going to sit here and watch these trees what in the world are you talking about DAV what's your plan what we just going to say here and watch the trees but listen is amen because God had spoke to him and could you imagine amen and somebody come on and says David don't you see what the enemy's doing no I'm watching these trees and David turned his back to the enemy he says I'm not going to watch that and I really don't care what they're doing and I'm not going to keep my eyes on on all the criticisms and I'm not going to look at the websites I ain't going to read their books I'm not watching the enemy I'm watching them trees Hallelujah and then all of a sudden some moved across the top of them trees and somebody looked and said the wind's blowing David said no that's the angels of God hallelujah he said rise up amen pull your swords because God is going before us hallelujah and let me tell you something tonight I ain't watching the enemy I'm not looking at the critic I'm not listening to the devil I'm looking at the Vindicated word hallelujah and I'm not waiting on the rustle in the mberry tree I got the word of a prophet the move is on for the bride that's thus sayith the [Music] Lord hallelujah the bride will have thus sayth the Lord I shall keep still but we have thus sayith the Lord tonight listen to me young people this ain't the time to quit this ain't the time to lay down this ain't a time to back up this is the time to draw your sword Hallelujah I hear the sound I hear the rustle in the moay bush tonight the mve is on the angels of God what you felt they sweep through this build the last two nights that wasn't just a win that wasn't just a workup that ain't just an emotion that's the angels of God and thus sayith the Lord the move is on as a mus musicians come tonight I tell you what moves I tell you what moves the bride it's the faith of God and we're moving towards a a prayer line tonight from what I understand brother the brother has it on his heart to do listen friends I'm going to I'm I'm closing the service with this but I'm giving you something to take home with you cuz you're going to some of you is going to come up here you're going to move up here and God's going to do something for you but I promise you the devil's going to be right there and Monday and next week and a few days from now Devil's going to be right there on your shoulder and he's going to say you just got excited in Camp you just got a little work up cuz you know it was just it was it was just a preacher pulling on you or all these all these things this this is where the devil's going to work on you in this but brother Brown in perfect Faith he said Jesus what gave him such Faith was he had confidence in who he was because of what the word said about [Music] him he was the word made flesh he said if he could have that confidence he said could did you not have the same confidence as a Believer and he said a Believer is a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you the believer is the faith of God listen I want tell you there ain't but one the faith brother B said that's the faith that was once delivered to the Saints Paul said the life that I now live amen I live by the faith of the Son of God not in the son of God the Son of God it's not your faith it's his faith in you and brother Brown said a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you let me tell you something one day disciples was out on on a boat and there a great storm come and in the middle of that storm Brother David Jesus come walking on the water now when Jesus come walking on that water they the Bible says they were afraid brother R would say the very thing the only thing that could actually help them there was afraid of it they looked at thought man this is a spirit and this is it was Supernatural you see something they couldn't reconcile in their mind or understand in that way so they were afraid of it and Peter I love Peter I tell you he's one of my favorite favorite Bible characters cuz I so identify with him he makes all kind of mistakes and says things he shouldn't say when he the wrong time and any of y'all ever feel that way but you know in spite of all the mistakes Peter made you got give him it was something special about that Peter had because he looked out there and he said Lord if it's you bid me come and brother Brown said when Jesus spoke the word come he said the word told Peter he could walk on the water and Peter's faith in that word moved him out of the boat onto the water listen some of y'all might be sitting in the seat tonight and you might be wondering is this real or is this the spirit of God is this is this reality or is this just a an excitement of a meeting or just what is this why don't you just say in your heart tonight Lord if it's you bid me come and you let God speak to you and that Stills my voice and if you move down here tonight and you come in this prayer line you come because God spoke to your heart and the word of God spoke directly to you and you move by the faith of God and when the Devil comes next week and says oh you just got excited you look at that devil and say no devil it wasn't emotion that moved me it wasn't excitement that moved me it was God's word that spoke to my heart say you might be saying well brother Josh I've tried this before well there another time Peter was out fishing and they had told all night you remember that and they had done everything they could and tried as hard as they could and failed they fished all night and at the end of the night they were just disappointed with empty Nets Jesus come along and said why don't you launch out in the deep and drop your nets Peter said but Lord see he couldn't understand it but there was something in him and you know what I love he said he said nevertheless at Thy word at Thy word listen friends let them let the word move you tonight and let the faith of God in your heart move you and the god of heaven will answer let's stand our feet Hallelujah only believe that all things are [Music] possible believe holy believe ohy [Music] believe that all things are [Music] possible only could you sing it this way Lord I receive and Lord I

atmosphere now we believe even if you can't feel him even if you can't see him you know no matter what you feel tonight your feelings don't have anything to do with it friends we've met the requirement of God's word and now we take God at his word and say Lord whether I can see you or feel you I'm going to raise my hand and say I believe that you're here I believe you're here to meet my expectation you'll get what you expect you come through this pray line have an expectation say Lord I believe faith brother bam said doubt can accumulate and Demon spirits of Doubt will try to accumulate unbelief but also did you know Faith accumulates and you put your faith together with mine why don't you raise that hand up say Lord I'm applying my faith I'm bringing my faith in the Son of God of the Son of God right now and I'm saying holy spirit let Faith accumulate in this building let my expectation come and reach out from the depths of my despair whatever my need is tonight Lord I want Faith to accumulate around me I don't want any unbelief in my heart but I'm going to expect that God will meet me on the basis of his word amen you heard the preaching of the word of God
