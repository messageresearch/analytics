believe that all things are possible [Music] only amen amen certainly believers today praise the lord preach in the name of the lord we're happy to have you here in the house of god with us today amen and trusting that the lord will bless you mightily already has no doubt and we had a nice sunday school class this morning i appreciate the people who were able to make it out and uh just greetings to our visitors once again today amen happy to have casey and her friend here today again greeted her in the sunday school and uh shanira i understand standing there with sister back amen this is who brother caleb took to the river and baptized her in the death burial and resurrection of christ amen so we're happy to have her here today amen praise the lord we want to look um at in our scripture right away but i want to make this announcement to the especially the parents of the senior youth and brother matt posted this in that chat but if you're if your senior youth have a desire to attend camp but are facing financial difficulties that would prevent them from getting to go there are sponsors right here in our assembly who are willing to cover their camp fees please contact myself or brother matt directly i would just say contact brother matt directly hey man he's heading that up we had to charge for this one because it's uh done on a much larger scale we incurred quite a bit of expense i just would maybe just mention to you about the past youth meetings that we had that wasn't really a camp because we uh people were staying in motels there wasn't a lodging and uh there wasn't a tuition to cover or can't fee to cover any of the costs this time we're charging it consequently uh we spent about ten thousand dollars uh on your senior youth amen now thanks be to the lord i had plenty of reserves saved up for that because i knew that would be costly i've seen how those things go and we were happy to do it we fed everybody and we had tent rentals and chair rentals and we wanted to make sure we gave the minister a good love offering and uh just a lot of lot of expenses involved in that we asked the parents uh of the senior youth to please donate to that and most of them did not all so i would imagine they're stunned some still that may be planning to do that i hope and then i would also like to recommend to the senior youth who hold down jobs you know you need to be uh donating to that because it was for you and so we want to we want to let the parents know that it was an investment let the whole church know uh we did we haven't given you an opportunity uh as a church to to give back for to recoup some of that we took up an offering on the sunday morning and with what has come in from the parents and what came in on that sunday morning i've recovered about eighteen hundred dollars of that ten grand so uh if the lord would lay it on your heart to give uh just earmark market uh for the past youth gathering that we have we'd like to see uh some of that come back in to resupply our ministry fund ministry fund pays for a lot of stuff any any and everything related to ministry uh even the purchase of this organ because it deals with the ministry so we didn't even ask the trustees to cover that that's part of the ministry every musical instrument in here all the equipment in that sound booth and every upgraded all the software everything comes out of the ministry out of your ties that you pay support of the ministry love offerings for ministry all of that comes out of that fund so we were happy to do it and i just want to ask you to be praying and if the lord would have you to do something now again uh this next one we are going to be charging a fee to cover won't cover everything we'll still have uh no doubt quite a bit but hopefully it won't be to that level but it's going to be amazing and so we wanted to make sure that your children um you know say brother jason that seems like a an absurd amount hey it's just the cost of when you try to run a meeting like that you want to house everybody but listen our senior youth are worth it they are the future bethel tabernacle if the lord should carry on in generations to come so i think it was a grand investment i'd do it all over 100 times amen so we just want to make you aware of a little bit of church business there and give you the opportunity because like i say we haven't officially asked the church as a whole certainly parents should be donating to that and you senior youth should be but we want to also ask the church in general those who are streaming amen just want to make you aware of that so praise the lord we're happy for the lord's blessing amen we don't make big pulls for money we don't believe in that brother didn't believe in that we don't do it we've never been guilty of it the lord takes care and he always has so god bless you uh as the lord would speak to your heart on that but we just want to make you aware that if if there's a financial burden and your senior youth can't quite come up with that because it's 189 ahead and that covers all the activities and meals in the camp and everything and if you can't we do have sponsors here in this assembly have already come forward said we will sponsor anyone who can't afford it so god bless you i just want to make that announcement we're going to look right into first corinthians excuse me chapter 3. i beg your pardon the devil just still battling me i mean some people are fantastic liars and he's like the king of all liars so he keeps trying to lie to me and say i've got a head cold and i just keep giving it back to him tell him he don't know what he's talking about amen he said well you've got the symptoms i say well the symptoms have anything to do with it i'm looking at a promise by stripes i'm already healed so i i just the more and more i go friends the more and more i just remind the devil satan you ain't nobody you don't make one decision about my life you got no say in my life amen i'm here i work i'm in service to his majesty the king and that's all that matters and so the king's business requires haste and we want to be up and about the father's business amen first corinthians chapter three we're going to take from our text last week on master builder we want to take part two of that today first corinthians chapter 3 verses 9 to 16. we are laborers together with you with god start again verse 9 for we are laborers together with god ye are god's husbandry ye are god's building according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth theron but let every man take heed how he buildeth their upon for other foundation can no man lay than that then that is laid which is jesus christ now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hey stubble every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is so the bible just simply saying some people build on gold silver and precious stones and that will survive the fire everything you invest in god's kingdom will survive the judgments of the world but some people build on wood hay and stubble and they the the the principles of god's kingdom to govern their lives and their families and their activities god's principles are secondary to them and paul is warning you build like that he's not saying you're not a son of god daughter of god he's saying build like that and you'll lose it all because the the fires of this day the judgments are just too hot and too heavy they're coming from too many different directions and your your life your family your everything you've invested in and you built with some of the finest wood and the finest choice hey and the finest stubble you could find but it won't survive and that's the warning of the scripture all right so verse 16 know you not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple you are let no man deceive himself if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise amen let's let's pray father we again thank you for your word master and we pray that it will be a living bread of life to us we commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless you as you're seated amen praise the lord thank you for covering piano day sister ruth will get you on your brand new unit over there next week sister deborah and sister elaine are out visiting um brother dale and the family there in arizona praise the lord amen so we were discussing last time in preaching about this idea where paul calls himself a master builder and we made quite to do over you know being a master builder and knowing your way around a set of blueprints and specifications and understanding all the symbols and and we found that that we were we're all not just preachers but we're all master builders and this is why paul would say to us as individuals you know you are the temple of god and therefore god thinks sir god is trying to get control of his temple which you are and you're not your own you were bought with a price and i i i've told you the story before i was in in the ukraine and family camp meeting there in the ukraine and marbella belarus i don't remember which i think the ukraine and we were there was uh where we had to go to get uh phone service or internet service because the camp didn't have either and there was an office building office complex and there's a young woman there in her early 20s and she's she's quite friendly at first and she knows that we're ministers and uh you know we're just trying to be cordial to her and show her a a right christian attitude and spirit weren't there to judge her by any means we're there to help her if we could and i i remember one day after going in two or three days together as a group of ministers and she began to kind of you know make a little bit of a brag and she was a little giddy over it you know she was making her brag about how she had been out that night and and had her partying going on and she was just so much fun she just had so much fun and and uh you know and and she she talked about how that was really living it up and and of course that's just a little more than a good preacher could take and i i wasn't gonna try to you know condemn the young woman but i just wanted to let her know because obviously no one else had told her the truth that that's not life that's actually death and that if you keep giving yourself to that you'll be destroyed that you're made in the image of god you were made to be the temple of the holy spirit and it was the enemy that had turned the world into that and you know and right away her defense was i hear it all time you hear people say it this is laodicea laodicea it means people's rights everybody's got their rights uh and she said you know she just put up her hand just to stop me she in her broken english my body it's my body and and of course that's more than a preacher can handle too and i said well who who who told you that i thought wow you've been lied to now you're really being lied to and i said who told you it was your body and she just looked at me i think i could tell she'd never been asked that question before i said did you build your body did you put it here or did it come from somewhere did somebody give you life or can you keep your life right now if the one who gave it decided to take it do you think you could hang on to it do you think you could keep the breath in your lungs who told you it was your body don't you know that jesus christ purchased your body to lit to have as his temple at calvary and you're not your own you're bought with a price do you know that just the grace of god has given you life and it's the grace of god trying to save you who has lied to you so viciously to make you think that your decisions don't have consequences see if you live in this body the bible says let everything that hath breath praise the lord amen in other words your life should praise the lord or you should stop breathing amen if you won't let your life praise the lord stop breathing you're you're a thief you're you're a trespasser you're using breath that god gave you and you're using life god put in your body and you're not bringing it you're not letting it glorify him this was the whole one of the themes that we talked about last time how that you know master builder somebody who had come along as a master builder and said oh i can build zion you know they they they read a little bit of the blueprint in the book of revelation and they knew it was 1500 miles square they got that much and you know and every gate was a pearl they could see some of the details but when they when they hired on to build it told the lord i'm a master builder and then when they got done they'd build a cube and the lord looks at it and says i can't use a cube oh i can't use a cube because the walls would go all the way to the top and hide my glory you understand that city is a is a symbolism of you there is going to be a real city and it is going to be 1500 miles square but john says i was told i'll show you the bride the lamb's wife and he was shown a city coming down so the correlation is whether it's the city or whether it's you whether it's that temple or whether you're the temple you're built to give god glory and so it was spo he's you know and we we we we argued on behalf of the of this builder who claimed to be a master builder and pulpits today are filled with men who claim to be master builders but they don't build according to paul's instructions and the master of all master builders told them you can't deviate whatever i've built you've got to build it according to the revelation of christ and so they built 10 people into people thinking they're christians when they're not at all a christian and they're they're not at all a temple of the holy ghost they don't house god's presence they they don't change anything in their lives they just go to church and have their name on a book and they're warned in the in the in the specifications book they're warned that that that brings death that that's going to end in destruction that's not going to end well see so and and that's why you can't join a church you have to be born into the church of christ you have to have the holy ghost and when the holy ghost comes into you then you house his ten your temple housing his presence and then he gets to live his life through you amen that's abc's of christianity that's what a christian has always been for 2 000 years it was only man-made ideology that ever changed it and today you've got 45 000 different protestant denominations all claiming to be master builders and building the temple of god but there's only one one blueprint specification we can go by there's not another there's not another gospel you can't change it and hope to get god to give you the promises he put in his book see and so so so we we find that that it had to be built and we showed you that a symbol on the blueprint was found in isaiah and it was supposed to be built like a mountain and now any master builder should know that the only way to build a a a a wall a city and walls with a square foundation with four square foundations fifteen hundred fifteen hundred fifteen hundred fifteen hundred and yet and yet and and yet allow it to look like a mountain is you got to build it not like a cube but like a pyramid and so the walls angle over so then several hundred couple hundred miles of the of the city goes above the walls and you can see it because his light lightens the whole world the bible teaches us see so there's something to be said about why god needed to send a message in this day what was it to do bring a new gospel certainly not you you you'd be destroyed believing a different gospel it was merely to restore the original gospel to to to take the 45 000 who say they've got it and say i'm sorry you don't here's the original and if you're going to be his temple and if you want to live in his city you're going to have to be built according to his designs drawings and specifications amen and so now this principle even comes down into his family because you know the we we talked about the the the person you know in in ii samuel who ran without a message and there's a brother branham said that's the real problem they ran they were good men but they ran without a message i'm glad today that we had a runner to go and he he understands everything that went on he understands the mystery the the first runner he knew that there was a victory he didn't know what happened you know how it happened and he couldn't bring peace to david he couldn't give the answer to the people there was no shalom in his message because he didn't have all the mystery and it took the next man to come along the one who actually was sent with the full message and said you know and then he could answer all david's questions and then he could put every all fears to rest then he could put all doubts because the the holy spirit is a dissolver of all doubts amen so when the holy spirit is revealing his word to you you don't doubt it if you doubt it then it's not him revealing it to you amen that's abc's that's just simple deductive understanding and so so we found that a major part of the message to the world at the end time was a message concerning the book of redemption that was sealed up in the book of revelation and it had to be opened at the end time because that unveiled the mighty god the mighty god was hidden to the world he said he would be and he was and that's why you get 45 000 different denominations and and and that's and that's that's and and so it would be the book would be open the seals would be broke and the mighty god would be unveiled and when he got unveiled then that unveiled his bride his family and it unveiled the true church of christ amen so so this was a major uh point that that that is incumbent upon us to expose to the world because you know the world unknowingly is chasing the wrong thing and god has given the message to you to fix it to straighten out their understanding you're not doing a very good job of straightening out their understanding if you're living and acting just like they are it really wouldn't matter what you say your life speaks so much louder i mean how how how are you going to give them a book to read or a tape to hear and what they hear doesn't match what they see in you and you claim to be a follower of that i mean you're you're going to hinder their faith right off the right trying to help them you're going to harm them listen friends the only the only mission you're here to accomplish of course we were saying we were saying last time that of course heaven will be filled millions of people who never believed the message of the unwise virgin don't believe the message but they're still righteous virgins i get it but that's up to god that god will make that decision at the great white throne i'm not here to to save them god god will give them eternal life see he'll judge their heart and if they were righteous and not iniquity then then they'll be granted eternal life that's but that's not my mission my mission is to preach the full gospel to not fail to declare not only in word but indeed i'm to declare in word and indeed what god has done in this day so i'm not here to preach or live a watered-down message there is no such thing as message light there's michelob light there's bud light there's no message light and man i'm sorry for that crude analogy i just want to get you understanding my my terminology there is no such thing as that people have created it and that's just nothing more than creating another denomination there's only the full word in this day there's no partial and i'm not here to try to explain it partially or partially livid i'm here to be the full temple the full manifestation the full word that's what that's why we preach in this pulpit that's why we're holding outreach that's why we've got other plans for outreach our outreach isn't to show a compromised version it's to show the real version because that's what real mercy is not not the real virgin to condemn but the real version to help not the real version to judge them but the real version to open their understanding to say hey you've been told 45 000 different lies i'm here to give you the whole counsel of god if you're not doing that then you're you're harming trying to do outreach that's why i'm so glad to see outreach going on i'm so glad but let's make sure that we present the right image otherwise you're harming you're you're falling in the trend of the two messengers that blinded laodicea that blinded the sodomites remember because that's what the two messengers did in this day they told they sold to the people that all you had to do was have a mental acceptance of that day on calvary and mentally accept the historical figure of jesus christ that he was the son of god and died for your sins but but john made it clear that that historical figure was the word in the beginning and he's the word today and so if you if you say i really have accepted that man then you're accepting this now and if you're not accepting this now you're not accepting that man you're accepting an idea of that man he was the son of god you're not wrong in that he did die die for the sins of the whole world you're not wrong in that but he his his his secret to the to his disciples was a little while and the world won't see this historical man and the apostle picks that up and said there was a time when we we know today we know no man after the flesh merely i'll inject that merely we don't know he said not even the man christ jesus we don't just know him after the flesh anymore you'll never i'm here to tell you the world is never going to see the galilean walking the shores doing going about doing good the only because that man doesn't appear on this earth until the end of the of the tribulation in revelation 19. the that that man appears in the sky to receive the bride and the world misses that he comes like a thief the only version of that man they will see today is in you in his bride you're the flesh that they will see and encounter now amen so that is the major message that's a major part is to explain how the book of redemption what it has uncovered and so the whole bible then we find a bible teaches of its own self that its principles and its doctrines and its teachings and everything about it that that and even even the family of god where their names were put in a book before the foundation of the world that's what the bible teaches us and there's nothing that can change one single line of it now jesus said that's why jesus could say heavens and earth will pass away before any of my word will pass away now the only the the if you think that through this could only be true if jesus is saying heavens and earth will pass away but not my word see the heavens and earth would pass away before my word would pass away so the only way that could be true is if the word was written before the foundations of the heaven and earth heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away that's only possible if the word existed before the foundations of heaven and earth and so if it existed before the foundation of heavens and earth and i'm finding out that i'm a part of it then i existed in god in the mind of god before the foundation of the world and so god knowing by experience how all creation would do how all history would go and here's the beauty of the revealed word is is is what's really behind all the history it's one thing to know the history it's one thing to know the history of calvary but i do you know what's behind it do you understand what it's all about you understand how god led up to that and then accomplished that and then has went forward since that time see and so if you're missing that then you're missing the whole enchilada because you can't you're not going to gain the only way the bible teaches us very clearly very clearly and i could preach a whole sermon starting from right now and take you to scripture after scripture after scripture the new birth only comes by revelation of the word that's always how it comes it's god revealing himself personally to you in his word and you accept it you're like mary you say amen to the word it's revealed to her she caught it she said amen and she practiced her amen and so so so we find that that it's not about being convinced of right or wrong teaching that i mean teaching you know we all sometimes get our teaching a little skewed and we have to get corrected that happens to me as a preacher and i've been studying it since a boy i still find things where i find an old note and go hmm that was pretty true but let me sharpen my lens on that a little bit and i have to add an addendum to that or sometimes do a line item veto you know of my former thought and i go well that's good until that line scratch that out you know i'm having i don't have any pride keeping me from that i'm i humble myself to the word of god i'm like paul i know nothing and want to know nothing save jesus christ and him crucified because i'm aware that that's the only way i can survive that's the only source of life is christ in his word see so i'm not here to have a different version of the word or compromise the version that god sent see so so we find then that the question becomes you know where do you want to find yourself today yes amen what is it make up your mind what is it you want from god why are you a believer why are you in church see why why have you embraced something that is so in such a minority and largely derided by the world as a cult and as and they they there's no way i get it of course they can't prove that they not by the bible anyway you can't and i've challenged it around the world there's no no chance to disprove a single teaching of this message not not using your bible if you're going to try to challenge the the message teaching you better find a different book not this one this one eats you up trying to do that one and i've i've that that's been there done that got the t-shirt got tro got got t-shirts galore over that so there there's no i can hear i'm here to tell you friends as a student of the scripture we have not believed cunningly devised tales it is all certainly and not only provable doctrinally and theologically but it's provable in our lives it it literally turns people into this image into the image of this and that's what paul is talking about this is all gold and silver and precious stones but if you're not careful even as a child of god you'll build your life and your family and your activities and and and your career and what you're chasing whether it's the american dream the global dream the whoever's dream you know uh and and you'll find that it's all wood hay and stubble and the age and the fires of judgment that are falling upon us what you've built won't survive you yourself will paul makes that clear you that the person might survive because they're a child of god but i you know i don't want to run in vain i'm glad i'm a child of god i'm glad i'm a son of god i'm glad he revealed his word to me and i want to show my gratitude to the world for what he has done for me see and so you have to decide where you want to find yourself today for me i choose that record written in heaven that's for me in my house i choose this record not interested in the fortune and glories of the world you know reality defies expectation very often we find in the world today i want to read you some statements brother and i made in the legacy and church age and we we find here that he makes this statement let me let me let me catch this first part of it so he says in the laodicean church age in the church age book god says this church of the laodicean age is wretched now that's scripture you can read it for yourself the word comes from two greek words which means endure and trial and it has nothing to do with the trials that come to a true christian for god describes a christian in trial as blessed amen amen and his attitude in a trial one of joy whereas the term the description is phrased wretched and miserable so clearly that's not talking about a christian not a person who's born of the spirit of god it might be talking about the 45 000 different so-called and in fact is it is talking about those systems of man that that produces wretchedness see and and that's not something william branham invented that you can read it in your own bible that church of the last day was not called glorious she was called blind she was not called virtuous she was called naked see and she didn't have christ in her midst because she kicks him out and he's found on the outside knocking calling to individuals come out of her my people if you'll open the door if you'll open your heart to me i will come into you and we'll have fellowship i'll sup with you oh the plan of god is so divine i love it it it it soothes me it gives me peace and understanding of what's happening in the world today it's how i sleep at night peacefully tie rise it doesn't matter what the headlines say i already know what's behind it all so he says a cr so he says and it has nothing to do this this word uh wretched the word comes from two greek words which means endure and trial has nothing to do with uh the trials that come to a true christian uh for god describes a christian in trial as blessed and his attitude one of joy whereas the description is phrased as wretched and miserable how strange now listen watch how strange remember i'm talking about reality often defies expectation you know all should be well but it's not and you know we've got a world falling apart and ripping apart at the seams and and then yet in this modern age you know we we have such such wealth and such technology and such civilization we have so much civilized law and civilized standards and and there's so much you know modern medicine and and and wealth and it's it's all over the world and yet you know in this modern age we should have ease until reality smashes you in the face and you realize what's wrong something broken here and brother branham says how strange in this age of plenty in this age of progress in this age of abundance how can there be trials well now it is strange but in this age of plenty and opportunity when everyone has so much and there's so much more to be had what with all the inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure now it's so good you don't even have to work they'll just keep paying you and nobody wants to work anymore i had a the manager of kroger tried to explain to me the other day i'm at the customer service to exchange a refund that i've i've brought all the way from buford and there's no one working there and he says i'm sorry i had to take the customer service lady and put her on the on the cash register because we got lines going down people are standing in line and i said well when will she be back he said i can't tell you i said well how do i get a refund he said you have to do it there and i'm like so he goes i'm sorry sir he says we can't find anybody wanting to work and there's a man from new york from new york visiting and he pipes up and he goes yeah he said i just saw it in the paper today he said up north he said if you if a man and a woman were don't anybody moved to new york finding this out said if a man and woman who were both employed or now are now staying at home and they're collecting unemployment plus plus the free stimulus money that the government's handing out he says their salary right now is a hundred thousand dollars to stay home a hundred grand why would they go to work see and so so he says with all of our inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure now brother bran was saying this is what i mean we should have utopia i mean this should be shangri-la my goodness we got machines to do our work we got money we got and and everything we've got we've even got opportunities to even have more depends on how much we want to you know go to the grinder wheel and i mean you can you can chase your dream and have at it and be all you can be and go for it and just do it and they've got every slogan out there encouraging you and brother branham says how strange it is that when right in the middle of all of this suddenly we find a mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation and that was in the 60s when it was cub scouts today the mental illness is un it's indescribable that every day in this country we have a mass shooting on average and so supposed to be saying oh he was my neighbor and they were he always seemed to be fine a fine man i can't believe that she did that and conspired with a boyfriend and did all this and and killed and and then babies and children and and and i mean and and a prophet said back then back then in the 60s said the world's going insane that wasn't his opinion that was prophecy and nobody else was pointing to it but a lone prophet was saying it's going to get worse and worse until jesus comes till the whole world will go completely insane i'm here to tell you something friends you've arrived and you're not going to want to be building your life off of wood hay and stubble at this time at this juncture we have arrived at probably the greatest juncture of time of all junctures of all time god is getting ready to translate a bride off of the earth when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about millions are taking sedatives at night pet pills in the morning rushing to doctors entering institutions trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol he goes on and on and on and on and on so he says yes this aids boasts catch it this age boasts of its tremendous stores of worldly goods but the people are less happy than ever this age boasts of its spiritual attainments but the people are less sure of themselves than ever this age boasts of better moral values and it is more corrupt than any age since the flood amen you know this is true you live out there with me you know this is true it talks about its knowledge in science but it's fighting a losing battle in all fields for the human mind and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or keep abreast with all the changes that have come upon the earth in one generation we've gone all the way from horse and buggy age to the space age and we're proud and boastful about it but inside is a dark void cavern that is crying out in torment and without a known reason men's hearts are failing for fear and the world is so dark in that this age could well be called the age of neurotics it boasts but it cannot back it up it cries peace and there is no peace it cries that it has great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire there is no peace saith my god to the wicked my he makes a statement and i'm not gonna read it because i just want to keep moving he makes a statement about the age we live in how that it's an age of pressures and and a great burden of the last age was this neurotic age that we live in amen and you know he he talks about how that you know the great burden of the last stage now catch this this is astonishing he first compares the the burden of the martyrs in the church ages who went to the lion's dens who were burned at the stake who were torn asunder you know uh by by martyrdom and he says now that's not our burden that was a burden of that age they had a knox anointing to get them through that today we have an eagle anointing to keep us soaring above all the darkness and chaos see and so but he says now the burden of the last age is the pressures of riches the pressures of it not only to have and have more and have all you can get and have half of everybody else's that's left laying around and i mean the the like brother ernie would say you're you're in the little you're in the little rat in the spin wheel and you're going as fast as you can you ain't going anywhere he says even if you win the great rat race you're still a rat oh i want to be an eagle soaring off the off the earth and so he says the example the great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches one soft living two and nervous tension now catch what he's connecting the pursuit i said years ago isn't it funny that everybody goes crazy trying to pursue to become the thing that jesus said would be almost impossible to go to heaven as isn't that amazing and yet satan has us on that treadmill trying to become the very thing determined to become the very thing that jesus said would be almost impossible even to go to heaven as and everybody wants to be that see and so he attaches the pursuit of riches soft living and he connects it with nervous tension what what a what a trifold thing that is and he says soft living and nervous tension in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in amen amen now if if you're not born again of the spirit of god that just that makes no sense to you because the the spirit of the world says be all get all go for it just do it run hurry quickly and nobody takes responsibility anymore and dishonesty is now the norm and and you know nervous tension of the world but for the christian we realize that wow this i seem unfitted to live here you know i see i see my neighbors and what all they're doing and i'm not trying to be weird i'm not trying to stand out i just feel like i don't belong in this world anymore it's gone cuckoo the laws they're passing the the things i see in the headline and the things people are marching over and rallying around and you know this agenda and that agenda and this political move and that political move i did i finally quit reading the headlines i said i'm so unfitted for this and yet i and yet i'm here so you know when i decided i thought well my goodness then then if i gotta be here i'm sure gonna run it correctly i'm sure gonna try to live it right so that i can try to help somebody because i realize that that the world is being destroyed and i i'm going into a rapture and i would really like to take everybody with me that i possibly can and so you can rest assure that's why i'm building my life out of gold out of gold silver and precious stones that's exactly why i don't build my life out of wood hay and stubble and why i preach to you that you shouldn't do that either see stop chasing this world a christian's unfitted to even live in it see the further the age see this fourth age seems to have had a clear-cut burden it was to defy rome stand up for the word even unto death and so that's in the thyatiran age so you know i i just wanna i just wanna speak to you from my heart now you've heard what the prophet said this complex age that as believers as real christians born of the spirit of god we seem unfitted to live in and i wonder if we have a full appreciation of just how unfitted this world has become amen for a true believer to live in are we have we become like the frog slowly boiled in oil boiled in water and the temperature just goes up slowly until he doesn't even realize he's being cooked alive because the new the higher temperature was unnoticed it's just more normal just more normal and then finally his last thoughts are oh my goodness it's so hot and then he's gone see and i wonder today friends here in near the end already almost halfway through another year here we are halfway through 2021 and i wonder if we have a full appreciation of over the last half century since the opening of the of god's word i wonder if we have a full appreciation of just how unfitted this world has become it might explain when i think about this question it helps to explain to me you know how i see people who i believe to be true children of god and yet not accomplishing their mission too well all right this is just in shepherd's heart speaking to you this is my job this is my duty all right my sister melissa i think years ago i still have it in my office gave me a plaque and it is the duty of a pastor to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable but sometimes it helps me to explain how i see people who i believe to be true children of god yet they're not really accomplishing their mission too well lots of visible wear and tear i'm just telling you as a shepherd who overlooks your life who's here as a guide and as a bishop for your soul as the bible calls me i take that job very seriously see and i i cannot i cannot hold back sometimes i i say things and i'm i'm i'm not immune from saying them in the wrong way but i always try to at least say what's true and i'm definitely guilty of not always using the right tact and not having the right bedside manner but but i but i have taken the hippocratic oath to do no harm i am a doctor i am a doctor that's what i do here's my medical book and i i'm trying to bring because the word of god is health to all your flesh so i'm a dispenser of health see so a lot of times i i might have to be you know just put it to you straight hey keep doing that you're going to die and and sometimes people don't like to hear a doctor say that you know but i'm trying to get you to take this medicine so that because i know if you don't then doane down the line i got more meds but they get more nasty have more side effects and i don't want to see you get all the way to the bottom of my doctor's bag and the best answer i've got for you is a bad one i'm sorry you should have took the medicine at the top of my bag it would have fixed the problem and you wouldn't end it up where you are see and now the medicine i got it'll work but man are you gonna have some side effects man is it gonna be bitter going down see and so i you know i see visible wear and tear on people who i firmly believe to be children of god i see a lot of wear and tear and life habits that are questionable by the holy ghost you know the holy ghost will question you don't think he won't he questioned balaam who's this in your house lord uh i got this question i need to ask you and you know can i do this can i do this can i do this and god never even regarded his question he just said he answered his question with a question who's in your house why are these people why are you talking to them well they offered me they they shouldn't even be under your roof their whole motive and objective their modus operandi is to is to curse my people to do harm to my family why would you have anything in your home that does harm to my family why would you have a lifestyle that's harming my family see and so i he quite remember he questioned david sent nathan what do you say david i'm such and such a case and david says that man needs to die and nathan said well hate to break the bad news to you you're the guy i'm actually talking about you david see and so i you know i see i see church habits with tremendous wear and tear my goodness with tremendous wear and tear sometimes i scarcely can identify the the person that i once knew i can scarcely compare their past to their present i've seen whole families to where here's a former way they used to look and now here's where and i go my the wear and tear that has taken its toll on this whole family oh this brother this sister they used to have such a sincerity such a prayer life such a dedication that family was such a way and now it's now this person this dad this mom this pastor this deacon this this young person that those children they're they're whole you can see their whole mindset is now changed don't lock up on me bethel tabernacle i'm preaching about master builders i'm trying to be a master builder today i'm trying to help you not trying to hurt you not trying to make you mad i'm not trying to make you feel you know awkward i'm trying to help you see i see mental and emotional wear and tear to the point of collapse on some and some actually have can i remind you today if sermon i preached a couple wednesdays ago you are high value real estate amen you are worth a lot to god your body is his temple your home is his dwelling place your life is to be a a reflection of his word to a blind wretched complex neurotic age chasing the wrong things and your life is supposed to be an example of the polar opposite so that they can look at their chase and and know that the turmoil they feel in their lives and look at you and say gee how do you don't even have as much as me i got way more money than you but man you have more peace than me how's this working i i you know i sent my kids to the best school and i got psychiatrists for all of them but i see your children are just full of love and kindness and how did you how did you pull that off see now's your opportunity to be a preacher say well i'm glad you asked you got a little while i can tell you how this happened didn't happen because i got a lot of virtue or wisdom but i but i but the mighty god was unveiled in this hour and he told me how to apply the token to my home and told me what to get rid of and told me what where i should go and to do and not do and today you got people who don't even care what a prophet said about those things have completely dismissed it as just well that was just his opinion i don't even need to do that anymore oh my goodness keep building off a wood hand stubble everything you're building is going to burn to the ground i'm here today to try to persuade you if if if i have to wave my arms and raise my voice or get soft and try to if i have to cry whatever i have to do i want to persuade you stop building your life out of wood hay and stubble you yourself might be saved but everything you're you're going to waste it all you're going to have problems you can't even solve without bitter medicine i want to tell you today there's a master builder who has a plan and you are valuable the real estate you're built out of the soil of the earth and god has had many times you know very high value real estate let me let me come to a close here in the next seven or eight minutes in genesis god sectioned off a very high piece of earth he picked a place where three rivers converged and he said of all the earth i'm going to build a garden right there of everywhere he could have built it he went all around the earth and said um right there i'm gonna build up my headquarters and i'm gonna build a beautiful garden and i'm gonna put my son and his bride there and i'm gonna give them godship over the earth there's another time god carved out a high value piece of real estate in the middle east and he promised it to abraham and to his descendants the only time in the only time in human history that i know of everybody runs around and says they've got they own land and on this and on i don't know that i don't have any record that the creator of all the land gave it to anyone other than he gave a piece of land to israel i don't even know i know even the native american claims oh you took my land okay well why who where how is it your land you know i only know of one piece of land that actually the creator of all the land gave to a people and titled it to them and deeded it to them and it's their land and when they say this is our homeland they're the only ones who authoritatively can even say that see so that's a high value piece of land in the middle east that everybody wants he gave it to his family for a dwelling place to live with him forever in in it in this land god pushed up a high value piece of real estate called mount moriah and there he met abraham and there abraham built an altar he pushed up uh you know in the wilderness he pushed up in the wilderness the mount sinai and there god came down imagine in the dawn of time when volcanoes were moving and the earth was being formed and created and god says he has okay somewhere down through history i'm going to meet abraham and so i need a mountain right here okay perfect stop right there okay now let it cool down and in a couple thousand years my servant will go there and i'll i'll be a ram caught in a thicket behind him and then someday 400 years later i better build me another mountain because my people are going to be in bondage that's part of my plan i'll let that man know when he gets there that's going to be 400 years and when it finally gets there then i'll have another prophet and i'll need him to take him to a place and i'm going to tell him now you're going to go to this place and i'm going to build a mountain i've had it built for a long time and i don't need you to go anywhere else in the world but right where i built if you say why do i got to go to that mountain because i'm going to be there why is it important that mountain because that's the mountain i'm coming down on to talk to you and if you're at another mountain you're going to miss the visitation if abraham would abraham said well i go yonder to that mountain i and the lad and i and the lad return returned your imagine if he to win uh in any many many moats catch a mountain by his toe it you know where you want to go i like that mountain it's green and covered and i think i could probably find water and game up there no there was one mountain see it was high value real estate near jerusalem near a garden called gethsemane god pushed up a small rather lonely rather non-descript hill there's nothing this hill was perfectly unremarkable to history the hebrews would later call it by the name golgotha and and that's that's a fitting name because it literally meant a graveyard or burial place that's what golgotha as a noun means in other words here's a sentence they put it in this is a golgotha of decaying bones i thought to myself what a perfect place for men who are dying to come to and be renewed and be reborn and this this nondescript you know nothing nothing about it you know nothing nothing no interesting features are going to be on this mountain yet when god was forming the earth he made that small lonely hill and he knew someday the lamb of god would hang to death on it and we find that you know it made it a perfect place for fallen man you know to to shame and destroy the most viable piece of earth ever known which was the lord jesus see they didn't desecrate the hill they desecrated the piece of earth being killed on the hill jesus remember i read you the quote this is my body this is my part of the earth and i'm living inside him and here jesus is a part of that earth you're a part of the earth and he had to become a part of what you're a part of because you had to be the same kind of species the only way he could be kinfolk to you to die as a kinsmen redeemer is he had to become a human like you see and he he walks that hill and here they destroy the most viable piece of earth ever known here they would vandalize and and tear apart the most precious gift god had ever bestowed on human men on humankind that hill that came to be called calvary luke says in luke 23 and when they were come to the place which is called calvary there they crucified him the male factors one on the right hand and other on the left brother branham picks it up in the indictment the greatest religious city the most religious people the most religious people of all the races in the most religious city and the most important time of their feast they crucified him the most precious thing the most in the most religious city at the most religious feast the most religious people killed the greatest offering god had ever offered a human to humanity here god would raise an ensign for all the world to see jesus said if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me all men all men all men all men good men bad men indifferent men he's here to draw them all how's he going how's he going to draw listen how's he going to draw this age if you won't be him amen are you you're going to have him come back and go and die again i'm here to tell you he's not supposed to have to come back and be crucified again he's supposed to be living in you and me so that he can do what draw all men good men bad men and different men wounded men ruin men hurt men so he can draw all men the best thing you can do for a ruined man is be christ the best thing you can do for a bad man is to portray the true image of the word be a master builder see the beauty of it all was that no matter how ruined a man or woman is god was basically saying if you come to me there if you'll come to me at calvary i'll bury all your sins in the sea of god's forgetfulness forever if you'll come stand with me at golgotha then you'll stand with me on zion that's why we're master builders friends i feel such compassion for those who who have followed builders who weren't master builders and they have a misconception of what the real word is if you and i don't give it to them in our lives then what's the point of your life why are you even here and after all god is given and done i'm here to tell you friends sometimes we get a lot of wear and tear on us but i'm glad there's somebody here who can rebuild why don't you stand up with me stand up with me as our musicians come i thank you for being patient and we had some business to take care of today and and uh make some announcements about offerings and things and the camp coming and young people who need assistance and um so you just keep those things in prayer just bow your heads with me all over the building as the musicians return and just play something uh of your choosing brother brad amen brother anthony everything okay with mom okay all right she's good now though all right let's let's bow our heads just place something softly for me sister ruth thank you lord thank you for allowing me to finish this thought and this burden of the word for the people i feel quite unburdened of it now lord and now i want to i want to think of its ramifications lord in my life and what it all means to me it wasn't just a sermon lord that's that's such a mistake that they made there in the old testament to um to jeremiah and he wondered why the people wouldn't listen to his message it depressed him he didn't he got to where he didn't want to preach anymore and he said i i just done i quit i can't it's just too much stress and and and yet he said but it but it was like a fire was shut up inside my bones and i couldn't be still i couldn't be quiet and you explained lord to your prophet that here's one of the problems prophet the the people just view you they view your sermons as just a beautiful song you're eloquent and you're you're you're you're part of the royal line and and they admire you and you they they like you as a person but that word that you're bringing so so they just choose to believe you're just a great singer and they don't have to take it seriously they can just sing those melodies and and but it doesn't really need to have an impact on their lives don't let that be today lord let it be that this word will have great impact upon the people lord everyone in the under the sound of my voice that's people in this building out of the building lord across the internet across the archives and live stream lord i you sent a master builder in this day you he didn't run without a message he didn't come to bring another denomination forty five thousand and one not interested in that lord he wasn't interested in that he was only interested in dressing the bride in the garments of the word that was his greatest joy and his greatest accomplishment he didn't need a college named after him he didn't need fortune and glory didn't need wealth he refused all of that many many times had by far many times over a greater ministry that's admitted to by historians today but he never he never wanted it for that reason lord he wanted to dress your bride in the garments of the word lord help us teach us show us show us how to be a real true light not a w lord when when a ship when a ship is on the raging storm we sea and it's loaded with people innocent people who are just trying to get to safety in the harbor and the storms are raging and it's dark and it's nighttime and there's no light father that lighthouse on a hill shining its beam it means everything to them lord you you wouldn't dim that light trying to save people how did that thinking ever creep into the message that somehow we have to turn the light down let's turn the candle watt power down so we don't stand out no we're a lighthouse we're supposed to stand out we're supposed to the beam we need to brighten the beam not dim it to shine it lord brighter than it's ever been shown because the world is darker than it's ever been what kind of thinking how upside down it would be to say i'm gonna i'm gonna live an example that is is less distinct and i'm gonna have a compromise so that i don't put people on edge and i i don't weird them out no lord i i'm trying to find your children i want to shine a bright light i'm trying to save these people they're being tossed on the sea of life and the only way is if my light beam is bright enough to cut through the darkness so help us lord we've got such tremendous inspiration you've given us to for outreach lord and there's a revival moving in our youth and they're wanting to be a light in the community and we have business people i i think of i think of the the burden that's on brother ken's heart and the outreach that urban brew is doing i think about
