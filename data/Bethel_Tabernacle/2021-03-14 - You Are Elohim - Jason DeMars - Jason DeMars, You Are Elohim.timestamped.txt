[0:14] do
[1:39] good morning everyone god bless you
[1:41] let's stand pray
[1:45] gracious heavenly father we come to you
[1:47] in the name of jesus christ and we ask
[1:48] that your spirit would be with us this
[1:50] morning
[1:51] lord i pray that you'd move upon your
[1:53] word
[1:54] make it a living reality in our hearts
[1:56] lord and may our
[1:58] may our faith be continually quickened
[2:01] by the spirit
[2:02] father be with us in every way
[2:05] through the through the sunday school
[2:07] worship preaching of the word
[2:09] may your name be lifted up and glorified
[2:11] we ask in jesus name
[2:13] amen amen we're going to turn in
[2:16] to psalms chapter 82
[2:20] and i'm going to start a new topic today
[2:23] 80
[2:23] psalms 82 verse 6
[2:27] and my topic is you are elohim
[2:32] all right psalm 82 6. i have said
[2:37] ye are gods and all of you are the
[2:39] children of
[2:40] the most high may the lord have the
[2:43] blessing to the reading of his word you
[2:44] can be seated
[2:49] i have said you are elohim
[2:53] and all of you are the children of the
[2:55] most high
[2:56] and i'm going to look at a study here
[2:58] today and you're all of your familiar
[3:00] brother branham talking about this i'm
[3:02] just going to be honest with you every
[3:04] time i would hear
[3:05] brother branham say you are gods
[3:10] your deity i would go
[3:14] ah where is that i can't and he would of
[3:17] course he explains it and goes through
[3:19] it
[3:19] and i want to take that back to the
[3:21] scriptures and see
[3:23] that in detail it's really beautiful
[3:26] actually
[3:27] if you see the big picture from old
[3:29] testament to new testament in the fourth
[3:30] seal brother branham says
[3:33] where it had been lost by adam and eve
[3:35] and went back after they forfeited their
[3:37] rights of the word the promises their
[3:39] inheritance they remember they control
[3:41] the earth
[3:42] he was an amateur god for he was a son
[3:45] of god and a son of god is an
[3:46] amateur god now that ain't contrary to
[3:49] the scripture i know that sounds strange
[3:52] but jesus said if you call them who the
[3:53] word of god came to and what does the
[3:55] word of god come to
[3:56] prophets if you call them with the word
[3:59] of god
[4:00] come to god's how can you condemn me
[4:02] when i say i'm the son of god see
[4:04] and now they were gods and man if you
[4:07] become
[4:07] born in the family of your family name
[4:10] you are a son
[4:11] and part of your father and then when
[4:13] sin came in we found out that the man
[4:15] crossed the chasm
[4:17] and the blood of bulls and goats covered
[4:19] but did not remit until the real
[4:22] bleach came that could take the stain of
[4:25] sin and break it completely to pieces
[4:27] and send it back upon its original
[4:29] perverter that was satan
[4:31] when it got back to satan he waits his
[4:33] time of eternal annihilation now that
[4:35] shows what we believe we believe that he
[4:36] will
[4:37] be absolutely be done completely away
[4:39] and annihilated i believe that sin will
[4:42] be broke up and when it's confessed upon
[4:44] the basis of the blood of jesus christ
[4:46] it's like dropping a drop of black ink
[4:49] in a bunch of clorox bleach it just
[4:51] breaks it into the chemicals and sends
[4:52] it plum back to where it come from see
[4:54] and that's the way the blood of jesus
[4:55] christ
[4:56] does then that sets a man across
[4:59] the chasm again as a son of god
[5:02] and then he becomes he uh why even he
[5:05] the creative power of god is in him
[5:07] and at least whenever god command can
[5:09] command it to be done it'll be done
[5:12] and we get back that's from the fourth
[5:14] seal
[5:15] so let's let's that's the basis of what
[5:18] i'm talking about now
[5:19] um at least for this sunday school
[5:21] probably probably
[5:22] more genesis 1 1 that's where we start
[5:26] in the beginning
[5:26] elohim created the heavens and the earth
[5:31] elohim from the strong's
[5:34] concordance dictionary
[5:38] plural of allah
[5:41] it's god's
[5:44] in the ordinary sense but specifically
[5:47] used
[5:48] uh of the supreme god occasionally
[5:51] applied by way of deference to
[5:54] magistrates and sometimes as a
[5:56] superlative
[5:58] angels god goddesses great judges
[6:01] mighty etc and we'll look at that
[6:04] scripturally
[6:05] first kings 8 23
[6:10] i just want to establish what this means
[6:12] when brother branham says
[6:14] we are gods he does not mean we are
[6:16] objects of worship
[6:17] so he's not using the term god in the
[6:20] sense of the english word
[6:22] which simply means an object of worship
[6:25] i believe he's using it in the
[6:26] scriptural sense
[6:27] of elohim and we'll see
[6:32] what what that means as we go forward
[6:36] he's also not saying that we have the
[6:39] same
[6:40] attributes as god we are an
[6:43] attribute of god but we in ourselves
[6:47] are not eternal in god we have eternal
[6:50] life
[6:50] but we in ourselves are not eternal we
[6:53] are
[6:54] not all-knowing we are not omnipresent
[6:58] we we we aren't those things you know
[7:02] god alone is that so first kings 8
[7:06] 23 and he said and i'm just gonna i'm
[7:09] going to take this
[7:10] it says lord god of israel but yahweh
[7:14] elohim of israel just so you get the
[7:16] picture
[7:17] yahweh elohim of israel there is no
[7:20] elohim like thee in heaven above
[7:23] or on earth beneath who keep his
[7:26] covenant and mercy with thy servants
[7:28] that walk before thee
[7:29] with all their heart there is no elohim
[7:34] that has attributes and in nature like
[7:38] jehovah there's no one like him
[7:41] isaiah 44 6.
[7:47] thus saith yahweh the king of israel and
[7:51] his redeemer yahweh of hosts
[7:54] i am the first and i am the last and
[7:56] besides me
[7:57] there is no elohim
[8:01] isaiah 45 verse 5
[8:08] i am yahweh and there is none else
[8:11] there is no elohim beside me i girded
[8:14] thee though thou
[8:15] hast not known me there is no elohim
[8:18] beside me
[8:19] exodus 20 2
[8:23] through 5.
[8:27] i am yahweh thy elohim which have
[8:30] brought thee out of the land of egypt
[8:32] out of the house of bondage
[8:34] you shall have no other elohim
[8:38] before me you shall not make unto thee
[8:41] any graven image or any likeness of
[8:43] anything that is in heaven above or that
[8:45] is in the earth beneath
[8:46] or that is in the water under the earth
[8:48] thou shall not bow down thyself to them
[8:50] nor serve them
[8:52] for i yahweh thy elohim am a jealous
[8:55] elohim visiting the iniquities of the
[8:58] fathers upon the children unto the third
[9:00] and fourth
[9:01] generation of them that hate me
[9:04] what are the gods of the other nations
[9:07] called
[9:08] in the bible elohim
[9:13] uh scripture is first kings 11
[9:20] 33.
[9:27] because that they have forsaken me
[9:31] and and have worshiped ashtrays
[9:34] the elohim female female version
[9:37] of the zedonians chimash the elohim of
[9:40] the moabites
[9:41] and milkham the elohim of the children
[9:43] of ammon and have not walked in my ways
[9:45] to do that which is right in mine eyes
[9:48] and to keep my statutes and my judgments
[9:50] as did
[9:51] david his father all right
[9:55] let's keep going deuteronomy 32 17.
[10:05] they they sacrificed
[10:08] unto devils not to god
[10:12] to elohim whom they knew not
[10:15] to new gods that came newly up whom your
[10:17] fathers
[10:18] feared not so here even the
[10:21] the devils the demons are called
[10:25] elohim all right first samuel
[10:29] 28 11 to 13.
[10:33] don't get stumped we'll tie it together
[10:35] just follow me follow me along it's the
[10:37] scripture
[10:38] you don't have to get mad at me just if
[10:40] you're mad at something now
[10:42] you're mad at god all right because it's
[10:45] the bible
[10:46] so just just slow it down all right
[10:50] first samuel
[10:51] 28 and it's 11-13 and then the woman
[10:54] then said the woman
[10:56] the witch of endor the medium of endor
[10:59] whom shall i bring up unto thee and he
[11:01] said
[11:02] bring me up samuel and the woman and
[11:05] when the woman saw samuel she cried with
[11:07] a loud voice and the woman spake to saul
[11:09] saying
[11:10] why hast thou deceived me for thou art
[11:12] saul and the king said unto her be not
[11:15] afraid
[11:16] for what sauce thou and the woman said
[11:18] unto saul
[11:20] i saw elohim ascending out
[11:23] of the earth not gods in plural elohim
[11:29] it was one person that was coming it was
[11:31] the prophet samuel
[11:32] the prophet samuel is now referred to as
[11:36] elohim psalm 89
[11:39] 5 through 8 and you could pull that up
[11:42] in the king james i'm going to read it
[11:44] out of the esv
[11:48] let the heavens praise your wonders o
[11:51] yahweh your faithfulness in the assembly
[11:54] of the holy ones
[11:58] for who in the skies or in the heavens
[12:00] can be compared to yahweh who among the
[12:02] heavenly beings is
[12:04] like yahweh an elohim greatly to be
[12:08] feared in the counsel
[12:10] of the holy ones and awesome above
[12:13] all who are around him o yahweh elohim
[12:17] of hosts who is mighty as you are o
[12:19] yahweh with your face
[12:20] faithfulness all around you now we're
[12:24] seeing an assembly
[12:26] in the in the heavens an assembly of
[12:30] holy ones keep that in your mind there
[12:33] we'll keep going
[12:35] psalm 8 4 through 6.
[12:40] this is also referred to in the new
[12:42] testament
[12:43] but it's very interesting what is said
[12:47] what is man that thou art mindful of him
[12:49] and the son of man
[12:50] that thou visitest him for thou has made
[12:53] him a little lower than the
[12:56] angels i'm not sure why they put angels
[13:00] there
[13:01] because the word is elohim
[13:06] you have made him a little lower than
[13:08] the elohim
[13:10] and has crowned him with glory and honor
[13:12] thou madest him to have dominion over
[13:14] the works of thy hands thou has put all
[13:16] things under his feet
[13:17] well i can tell you why they did and
[13:20] that's in hebrews 2 6 and 7.
[13:25] wait till you pull that up brother
[13:32] george
[13:37] yeah but one in a certain place
[13:39] testified saying what is man
[13:42] that thou art mindful of him or the son
[13:44] of man that thou
[13:45] visitest him thou madest him a little
[13:48] lower than
[13:49] the angels that's for sure in the greek
[13:52] angelos
[13:53] angels thou crownest him with glory and
[13:56] honor and did set him
[13:58] over the works of thy hands
[14:01] so there should there should be a
[14:04] connection starting to form a little bit
[14:06] there
[14:06] in your mind the angels the elohim
[14:12] genesis 3 4 and 5
[14:24] and the serpent said unto the woman you
[14:26] shall not surely die
[14:28] for god doth no for
[14:31] elohim doth know that in the day eat
[14:34] thereof
[14:35] then your eyes shall be opened and you
[14:37] shall be as elohim
[14:39] knowing good and evil
[14:43] so this is the temptation of the devil
[14:47] tempting them with being like elohim
[14:52] the fact is they were already made in
[14:53] the image and likeness of
[14:56] elohim they come off of him they're a
[14:59] part of him
[15:00] they were made to have dominion over the
[15:03] earth
[15:04] what more could they have been asking
[15:07] for
[15:08] they already were elohim
[15:12] exodus 7 verse 1
[15:19] and the lord said unto moses see i have
[15:21] made the elohim
[15:23] to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall
[15:26] be
[15:26] thy prophet psalms 82
[15:31] we're going to read through the whole
[15:38] chapter
[15:42] god standeth in the congregation of the
[15:45] mighty
[15:46] the word mighty there is the singular
[15:49] term for god
[15:50] l god standeth in the congregation
[15:54] of el so again this is
[15:57] another terminology or the assembly we
[16:00] saw that before
[16:02] the council of the holy ones this is
[16:06] sound probably sounding strange and
[16:08] weird and like you've never heard it
[16:09] before yeah
[16:11] yeah seems it was for me too
[16:14] so but this is this is a picture that's
[16:16] in all through scripture
[16:18] um and you'll see that so there's an
[16:20] assembly of
[16:22] l he judgeth among the
[16:25] elohim
[16:29] so in in esv it says god has taken his
[16:32] place in the divine council
[16:35] in the midst of the gods he holds
[16:38] judgment in the midst of the elohim
[16:40] and i want to go for go further verse
[16:43] two how
[16:44] long will you judge unjustly and accept
[16:47] the persons of
[16:48] the wicked selah now we're going to come
[16:51] right back to this
[16:52] but this verse that we should go back to
[16:55] this verse in exodus 21 verse 6.
[17:03] exodus 21 6
[17:12] then his master shall bring him unto the
[17:15] judges
[17:17] his master shall bring him unto the
[17:20] elohim
[17:22] he shall also bring him to the door or
[17:24] unto the doorpost
[17:25] and his master shall bore his ear
[17:27] through with an all and he shall serve
[17:29] him forever
[17:32] so here we have judges people are set up
[17:35] as judges what are they called
[17:37] elohim all right back to
[17:41] psalm 8 verse 3.
[17:48] defend the poor and fatherless do
[17:50] justice to the afflicted
[17:51] and needy deliver the poor and needy rid
[17:54] them out of the hand of the wicked
[17:56] they know not neither will they
[17:58] understand they walk on
[17:59] in darkness all the foundations of the
[18:01] earth
[18:02] are out of course i have said you are
[18:05] elohim and all of you are the children
[18:08] of the most high
[18:10] but you shall die like men and fall like
[18:12] one of the princes arise
[18:14] o elohim
[18:17] the one true and living god judge the
[18:19] earth for thou shalt
[18:20] inherit all nations
[18:24] amen so let's look a little bit more
[18:28] at what we talked about this divine
[18:31] council it should be it should remind
[18:34] you of several things
[18:35] first is the story of michael
[18:38] first kings 22 19 through
[18:42] 23
[18:45] it's not strange it's not a strange idea
[18:47] it seems like a strange idea maybe
[18:49] because you haven't heard it spoken of
[18:50] in this way
[18:51] before but this is the scriptural way of
[18:54] speaking about it
[18:55] however we hear it in in another
[18:58] sense and you'll you'll see that as i
[19:00] read a few more quotes and a few more
[19:02] scriptures first kings 22
[19:04] 19 through 23 and he said hear thou
[19:07] therefore the word of the lord
[19:10] i saw the lord sitting on his throne
[19:13] and all the hosts of heaven the council
[19:16] of the holy ones the divine
[19:18] counsel and all the host of heaven
[19:21] standing by him
[19:23] on his right hand and on his left
[19:26] and the lord said look at the council
[19:29] who will persuade ahab just think about
[19:31] it god is sitting upon a throne
[19:34] in theophonic form he's around him is
[19:37] the angels
[19:38] the host of heaven on his right hand on
[19:40] his left the divine
[19:42] counsel is there and he says
[19:46] who's going to deceive ahab we think of
[19:49] it simply as
[19:50] god decides god and god sends but god is
[19:55] with us he wants us to participate
[19:58] in the plan of salvation right
[20:01] he uses men but he also uses angels and
[20:04] he wants them
[20:06] to participate in the plan of redemption
[20:08] we all have ministering spirits
[20:11] around us to minister to those who are
[20:14] heirs of salvation right
[20:16] they're participating in that process
[20:18] like we are
[20:20] receiving and participating in the
[20:21] process for others
[20:24] uh who will persuade ahab that he can go
[20:27] up and fall at ramos gilead
[20:29] and one said on this manner and another
[20:32] said on that manner so even even god has
[20:34] a council meeting and he allows people
[20:36] to speak
[20:37] angels to speak freely to him
[20:41] we should do this oh we should do that
[20:44] didn't
[20:44] didn't didn't strike a chord with the
[20:46] lord at all
[20:48] and the lord said unto him and there
[20:50] came forth a spirit
[20:52] and stood before the lord and said i'll
[20:54] persuade him and the lord said him i
[20:56] said unto him
[20:58] how wherewith how how will you do it and
[21:00] he said i will go forth and i will be a
[21:02] lying spirit in the mouth of all his
[21:04] prophets
[21:06] and he said you will per you shall
[21:08] persuade him and prevail also go forth
[21:10] and do so
[21:11] now therefore behold the lord has put a
[21:14] lying spirit
[21:15] in the mouth of all these thy prophets
[21:17] and the lord has spoken evil
[21:19] concerning the
[21:23] daniel 4 17.
[21:35] this matter this is one of the strangest
[21:37] verses
[21:38] you you ever read without getting a
[21:41] glimpse of this big picture
[21:43] it's talking about nebuchadnezzar and
[21:45] nebuchadnezzar's
[21:47] situation where he is going to be sent
[21:50] into the wilderness
[21:52] and and eat grass like an animal
[21:55] so that's what the that's what matter is
[21:58] being spoken of
[21:59] this matter is by the decree
[22:03] of the watchers the word watchers means
[22:07] the
[22:07] awake ones i would refer this back to
[22:11] what brother branham said and
[22:12] said
[22:17] left my brain
[22:21] you think the ufos are coming down and
[22:23] they're not
[22:24] ufos they are investigating angels
[22:29] the watchers it means they're awake ones
[22:34] means they're always watching you hear
[22:35] about a recording angel he's there
[22:37] recording everything that's happening
[22:39] so now they're saying this is by decree
[22:42] of the watchers well we understand
[22:43] what that means actually wasn't them
[22:47] that said it who's behind it jehovah
[22:50] elohim
[22:51] but this is saying this is a decree of
[22:54] the watchers
[22:55] and the demand by the word
[22:58] of the holy ones to the intent that the
[23:01] living may know that the most
[23:03] high so what is the divine council makes
[23:06] this decree
[23:07] why so that the living will know that
[23:09] the most
[23:10] high rules in the kingdom of men and
[23:12] gives it to whomsoever he will and sets
[23:15] up over it
[23:16] the basest of men
[23:20] in revelation chapter four
[23:24] uh in 1961 brother branham is uh
[23:28] speaking here on isaiah chapter six
[23:32] in the year that the king uzziah died i
[23:34] als i saw also the lord sitting upon the
[23:36] throne
[23:37] high and lifted up and his train filled
[23:39] the temple glory
[23:40] what's his train there it is
[23:44] angels beings his train that followed
[23:47] him the trains that what come behind see
[23:49] his train filled the temple
[23:51] and above it stood the seraphims and
[23:52] each of them had six wings with twain he
[23:54] covered his face with twain he covered
[23:55] his feet and with twain he did fly
[23:57] and one cried unto another and said holy
[23:59] holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole
[24:01] earth is full of his glory
[24:03] and when the post of the door moved at
[24:04] the voice of him that cried in the house
[24:06] was filled
[24:08] with smoke and
[24:11] continuing from the same sermon here's
[24:14] the throne
[24:15] now the first at this throne is for the
[24:17] four living creatures
[24:18] outside of that is 24 just like that
[24:21] elders sitting upon
[24:22] the throne upon their thrones little
[24:25] thrones under and around
[24:26] this is great hosts of angels around the
[24:29] throne see what i mean they're everyone
[24:31] different one from another there's
[24:32] angels
[24:33] here's elders here is living
[24:37] creatures amen
[24:44] see
[24:46] okay so you see the picture there
[24:49] that's being painted god
[24:52] has angels that participate in his
[24:55] program we call them
[24:57] angels angels is a function right
[25:00] we think of angels that's the spiritual
[25:01] beings that watch over us they're
[25:03] they're
[25:03] spirits right they're they're uh
[25:08] spiritual beings some of them are
[25:11] seraphim
[25:12] they're not angels they're the throne
[25:14] guardians
[25:15] in the in the in revelation four
[25:19] five and six we see them and they're
[25:21] called living
[25:22] creatures or simply living beings
[25:24] they're not brother bands they're not
[25:26] beasts
[25:27] the four beasts they're not actually
[25:29] beasts they're living
[25:30] creatures living beings
[25:34] there but they're not those are not
[25:37] angelic beings
[25:38] angel is a function a spiritual being
[25:40] can become an angel when it brings a
[25:42] message
[25:43] to a human a human can become an angel
[25:46] when he brings a message
[25:47] to people so there's different orders uh
[25:50] in that but within the spiritual beings
[25:53] that god created
[25:54] there's different orders and i didn't
[25:57] add the scripture in
[25:59] to this but i'm going to pull it up i
[26:01] believe it's in
[26:04] ephesians 6 and also in
[26:07] colossians let me just do a quick
[26:10] search it's the word principalities
[26:21] yeah colossians 1 16
[26:27] for by him were all things created that
[26:29] are in heaven and that are in earth
[26:31] visible and invisible whether they be
[26:35] thrones or dominions or principalities
[26:37] or powers
[26:39] all things were created by him and for
[26:41] him so there is both
[26:43] visible and invisible
[26:46] thrones dominions principalities
[26:50] and powers you see in
[26:53] the prince of persia is one of the one
[26:56] of those
[26:57] beings those evil spirits that's spoken
[27:00] about
[27:00] in the book of daniel the prince of
[27:03] persia resisted
[27:05] gabriel from come and bringing a message
[27:08] to daniel
[27:08] and michael had to come and fight with
[27:11] gabriel
[27:12] in order to overcome the prince of
[27:14] persia so
[27:15] gabriel could come and deliver the
[27:17] message to
[27:19] daniel so there's different orders
[27:22] of created spiritual beings
[27:25] if you see it was uh the archangel
[27:28] michael
[27:29] did not dare to bring a railing
[27:31] accusation against
[27:33] satan why
[27:36] because satan was what what was he
[27:38] originally made to be
[27:40] what brother branham says something that
[27:43] to our minds seems radical but he says
[27:45] did you know that satan one day was
[27:47] co-equal with god
[27:50] why he's on he's on the highest level
[27:53] of spiritual beings that were created
[27:56] and so even michael the archangel says
[27:59] jehovah rebuked you he's not using his
[28:02] own authority he's using the authority
[28:04] of the one that's above
[28:05] all and so you have
[28:08] these different layers and levels of
[28:11] both visible and invisible authority
[28:18] and so there's those who are part of the
[28:19] assembly
[28:21] of the council of el and there's other
[28:24] spirits
[28:25] both good and evil spirits that come
[28:28] and have access to that throne
[28:31] to speak the accuser of the brethren
[28:35] what is he doing he's coming amongst the
[28:38] host
[28:39] of heaven to do what to accuse
[28:42] you and me
[28:45] all right i think i have to quit there
[28:49] we'll continue on but i want you to
[28:50] understand what brother branham said to
[28:53] say that
[28:54] we when we are redeemed we become
[28:58] sons of god and we are god we have we
[29:00] are deity
[29:02] he even says that these things are
[29:04] perfectly scriptural
[29:07] absolutely scriptural they're not
[29:08] they're not fantastic he's not saying
[29:10] we're objects of worship
[29:12] he's not saying some new age doctrine
[29:14] he's saying an old old
[29:16] doctrine that's from the old testament
[29:19] and the new testament
[29:20] it's beautiful let's stand
[29:26] heavenly father we just come to you now
[29:28] lord and i pray you just take these
[29:29] things and
[29:30] and uh may each one of us just search
[29:33] through the scriptures search through
[29:34] the message
[29:36] and get a better grasp and understanding
[29:39] of this
[29:40] lord i know there's much more to be
[29:43] spoken about it there's much more to go
[29:45] in
[29:46] and there's there's matters of great
[29:49] thankfulness and rejoicing that go on
[29:51] with
[29:51] go along with this lord and so we we
[29:53] just ask that your spirit would be
[29:55] present with each one you bless the
[29:58] service today that you'd move amongst us
[30:01] we ask it in jesus name
[30:02] amen god bless you
[30:32] you
