[0:00] Good morning everyone. God bless you.
[0:03] We'll start with a word of prayer.
[0:07] Heavenly Father, we just come before you
[0:09] Lord and we thank you so much for your
[0:11] goodness and mercy. Lord, we ask that
[0:13] your presence would be with us, Lord.
[0:16] That you'd bless the Sunday school, the
[0:18] service today, that you'd move in our
[0:20] hearts. Father, we ask these things in
[0:22] Jesus name. Amen. All right.
[0:26] Go ahead and pull up the PowerPoint for
[0:29] me, Noah.
[0:31] And uh we're going to look at the
[0:34] timeline that I put together looking at
[0:36] the future home.
[0:37] Amen.
[0:38] As we go forward, um we're going to just
[0:42] continue to break this down. So, in the
[0:45] beginning, God created the heavens and
[0:46] the earth. Paradise begins on earth.
[0:51] God sets it up. Comes to the seventh
[0:53] day. He rests and paradise is there.
[0:59] However, we understand that even in
[1:01] paradise there was an enemy
[1:04] right there. The God didn't subtract the
[1:08] devil. So it shows from the very
[1:10] beginning his intent and purpose was to
[1:13] bring redemption
[1:14] and he puts before them two trees and
[1:18] the two trees represent the test. I've
[1:22] called you to multiply and fill up the
[1:24] earth. All right. How are you going to
[1:27] do it? How will you multiply and fill up
[1:30] the earth? And they fail the test. A a
[1:35] foreign life is injected into that. And
[1:38] in that failure, everything changes.
[1:40] Paradise is now lost.
[1:43] Right? And so we look at we look at the
[1:46] the u
[1:49] full picture of the curse and we
[1:51] understand the whole universe was put
[1:53] under the curse.
[1:54] Amen.
[1:55] And we're going to we're going to look
[1:56] at the scriptures for that. So I don't
[1:57] want to get caught up there. I just want
[1:58] to briefly go through this. Then we look
[2:01] at this paradise being and lost. Now the
[2:06] intermediate heaven begins. So Abel is
[2:10] the first one that goes there. This be
[2:13] interesting to think about. Abel walks
[2:16] in. Where am I? Where is everybody?
[2:20] He's alone. This is not what God's
[2:22] original and is not what his final
[2:25] purpose is to create this intermediate
[2:28] heaven. That that came about. It's not
[2:31] as though it's a creation. It came
[2:32] about. It's a creation in the sense that
[2:35] God separated. It's the result of the
[2:37] fall. Heaven and earth are separated. It
[2:40] wasn't God's intention for these
[2:43] dimensions to be separated, but because
[2:45] of the fall, they're separated. Now, the
[2:47] intermediate heaven begins. And in fact,
[2:49] it started in the heart of the earth, as
[2:51] we spoke about before. It's not until 30
[2:54] or 33 AD depending on what ca what
[2:58] calendar and what interpretation you go
[3:00] by. One of those years uh you that's
[3:05] when that paradise that was in the heart
[3:07] of the earth emptied out. Now it's in
[3:10] what we call heavenly places.
[3:13] Right?
[3:14] Coming soon will be the millennium.
[3:17] Millennium is not the full redemption.
[3:20] The millennium is not
[3:23] the ultimate redemption. The millennium
[3:25] is the reign of Christ over the earth.
[3:29] It's the seventh day rest for the earth.
[3:33] But nevertheless, Christ and the saints
[3:35] must rule with a rod of iron. Why do
[3:39] they rule with a rod of iron? Because
[3:41] full redemption hasn't come in place
[3:44] yet. There's still
[3:47] sin.
[3:48] the full process hasn't come to
[3:52] fruition. That is the new heaven and the
[3:55] new earth. That's where the intermediate
[3:58] heaven ends and now there's a new heaven
[4:01] and a new earth. The question people
[4:02] always go to. We understand already the
[4:05] answer is it's not as though God create
[4:07] destroys this earth and recreates the
[4:10] new recreates a new brand new earth. No.
[4:14] What does he do? Just like he redeems
[4:16] us, he redeems the earth.
[4:17] Amen. He does when he gives us a new
[4:20] body, he doesn't create a brand new
[4:22] body. He takes the elements of this body
[4:26] and changes them into that immortal
[4:28] body. Amen. So Genesis 3:17,
[4:34] "And unto Adam he said, because thou has
[4:36] hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and
[4:38] has eaten hast eaten of the tree of
[4:41] which I commanded thee, saying, Thou
[4:43] shalt not eat of it. Cursed is the
[4:46] ground for thy sake." and sorrow shalt
[4:48] thou eat of it all the days of thy life.
[4:51] It's amazing that the Lord puts this
[4:53] curse in this way. Adam is the steward
[4:57] of just earth.
[5:00] The whole universe.
[5:02] God creates Adam to be what we uh what
[5:07] we call in English a go a small God. But
[5:11] really, we look at this word. He's a
[5:14] he's created to be a mighty one on the
[5:16] earth, an Elohim on the earth. And he is
[5:20] to take dominion and he's to refill the
[5:24] earth.
[5:25] Doesn't mean he's an object of worship.
[5:26] When we say that Adam was an Elohim or a
[5:30] God, if you look closely in the Old
[5:32] Testament, uh you'll see that angels and
[5:36] human rulers are referred to as Elohim
[5:39] all throughout scripture. And brother
[5:41] Brandham picks that up and says the same
[5:43] thing. He was a he was a small god on
[5:47] the earth, not an object of worship like
[5:49] we think, but he fell. And brother
[5:53] Brandham says he lost his godship. He
[5:55] lost he forfeited his godship. He
[5:57] forfeited his sunship and he lost his
[6:01] privileges as a son of God. And not only
[6:05] he lost it, everything
[6:09] everything changes when Adam sins. And
[6:13] if we look at this, it's not just the
[6:15] earth. It's not just the ground. It's
[6:18] every
[6:20] atom, every molecule, every quark, every
[6:24] proton, every neutron is changed. The
[6:29] the laws of nature are changed. When God
[6:33] created it, he didn't make this. He
[6:36] didn't create the second law of ther
[6:37] thermodynamics.
[6:39] He didn't create these these things that
[6:42] lead to death.
[6:44] Amen. Romans 8:20 says, "For the
[6:46] creature, or the creation, all of
[6:49] creation was made subject to vanity, not
[6:53] willingly, but by reason of him who has
[6:56] subjected the same in hope."
[6:59] Amen.
[7:00] This is not a science class, but if you
[7:02] look at the second law of
[7:03] thermodynamics, this is when it comes
[7:05] into play. Second law of thermodynamics
[7:08] says in a closed system, everything
[7:10] increases in entropy. Well, what is
[7:12] entropy? It speaks of everything going
[7:15] from order to disorder from the matter
[7:22] and the energy in the system degrading
[7:25] over time. That's that's what that is.
[7:28] God did not create this in the original
[7:31] creation. That's why I say when atoms
[7:33] fell, God put the second law of
[7:37] thermodynamics into place. Everything
[7:40] increases in entropy. That's why you're
[7:44] getting older. That's why you got to buy
[7:46] a new car. That's why if you just let
[7:49] everything go in the field, what does it
[7:51] what increases? Entropy. It doesn't
[7:55] increase in order. It increases in
[7:58] disorder. And that's the same way down
[8:00] even to the molecular level. Thing get
[8:03] things things get older and weaker. The
[8:06] the cells in our body get weaker and
[8:09] decrease in energy. Yeah. Amen.
[8:12] Even to the very mitochondria within
[8:14] your cell, all of that, it gets weaker
[8:17] and slower.
[8:19] Amen. You know that we get older, right,
[8:21] Brother Luther?
[8:22] Yes, sir.
[8:25] Amen.
[8:28] Even upon all of this, there is still
[8:31] beauty in God's creation.
[8:34] And there's still order in God's
[8:36] creation. And people say, well, how how
[8:39] could God be a good God or how could God
[8:42] be real if there is such chaos and
[8:46] disorder? See, the second law of
[8:48] thermodynamics
[8:50] and the fall in the garden, it's plain
[8:52] as the nose on your face. Anyone that
[8:53] would say that is showing their total
[8:56] ignorance to say it in a very kind way
[9:01] because
[9:03] the fact that there is disorder and
[9:06] chaos proves to us that there is
[9:09] something called sin.
[9:11] Amen.
[9:11] And that there's a God who is a judge of
[9:14] all and who judges sin. Right there it
[9:17] should put a person in fear.
[9:19] This is the result of sin. This is
[9:22] punishment on a world that tends towards
[9:26] sin.
[9:26] Amen.
[9:27] Amen.
[9:32] Genesis 3:22. And the Lord God said,
[9:34] "Behold, the man has become as one of us
[9:37] to know good and evil. And now, lest he
[9:40] put forth his hand and take also of the
[9:42] tree of life and live forever."
[9:45] Therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[9:48] from the Garden of Eden to till the
[9:50] ground from whence he was taken. So he
[9:52] drove out the man and he placed at the
[9:54] east of the garden of Eden cherubims and
[9:57] a flaming sword which turned every way
[10:00] to keep the way of the tree of life.
[10:06] So again, we look at we look at the book
[10:09] of Genesis in particular, chapter 3, and
[10:12] we see a great deal of um
[10:16] mystery hidden there. There's no
[10:18] physical place on planet Earth that you
[10:22] can find on the east side of a garden
[10:25] that there's an angel. There's a
[10:27] cherubim waiting with the flame of sire
[10:29] fire to prevent you from coming there.
[10:33] back up from 10,000 ft. What happened as
[10:37] a result in the Garden of Eden? God
[10:41] separated his presence and he separated
[10:44] heaven from earth.
[10:46] This is what happened. And so when you
[10:48] see God placing this picture, he drove
[10:50] out the man. He drove him out of the
[10:53] garden.
[10:54] That's sin separating God and man.
[10:58] Amen. Now there's this gulf fixed where
[11:01] we can't we can't pass into the presence
[11:03] of God
[11:04] on our own.
[11:06] Amen.
[11:08] He's eaten. He says he's eaten of this
[11:10] tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[11:12] He's just like God and his angelic
[11:16] beings. They know good and evil, right?
[11:20] They've experienced, they've seen good
[11:22] and evil. And now the man is like us.
[11:27] Let's not. We can't allow him to
[11:30] reproduce his God's own life
[11:35] so that people would live eternally. So
[11:37] we prevent them from coming to the
[11:40] presence of God. We pre prevent them
[11:43] from producing immortal children. So
[11:46] what was lost? Immortality, access to
[11:49] the presence of God, access to heaven.
[11:51] So this is a picture showing us that
[11:56] fact. Again, it would be very difficult
[11:59] that as we read at the end, where is the
[12:02] tree of life? The Bible says it's still
[12:05] in the midst of the paradise of God.
[12:08] So, if it's a literal tree, then we
[12:10] should find a literal place on earth
[12:13] where this tree is and there's an angel
[12:16] there standing preventing you from
[12:18] coming there. I promise you that would
[12:20] be a fantastic thing that we would
[12:22] probably know about. But the fact is
[12:25] that's not what God is telling us here.
[12:27] He's telling us just what just what I
[12:29] said. You don't have you're not you're
[12:31] no longer immortal. You cannot reproduce
[12:34] children with immortality and you have
[12:36] no access to to heaven anymore.
[12:40] The holy God could not dwell amongst a
[12:43] sinful and unholy man.
[12:47] Looking at it from another direction,
[12:49] Adam had the title deed to all of
[12:52] creation.
[12:53] to the family of God.
[12:56] What did he do? He lost it. So where did
[12:58] it go? To Satan's hands. Could never.
[13:01] It went back to the original hand.
[13:04] The creator's hand. And it shows there
[13:07] has to be a second Adam to take that
[13:10] title deed back
[13:12] by living a perfect sinless life,
[13:16] shedding his blood, being an innocent
[13:19] sacrifice.
[13:20] And then he can take that book and claim
[13:23] it. And then he'll one day
[13:27] come back to a perfect earth with a
[13:30] perfect people.
[13:39] Christ has redeemed us now. We are we
[13:41] are now redeemed, but he's not claimed
[13:43] his possession yet. Now, you might
[13:45] differ with that, but just hold on a
[13:46] minute. See, we'll see. See, he hasn't
[13:49] claimed it. See, if he took the book of
[13:51] redemption, everything that Adam had and
[13:53] everything that he lost, Christ redeems
[13:57] back. Amen. That's from the breach.
[14:02] And he's already redeemed us, but he
[14:04] hasn't took possession yet. He cannot
[14:07] until the time appointed. And then he
[14:08] will then will come the resurrection.
[14:10] And then the earth will be renewed
[14:12] again. And then he'll take possession
[14:14] his possession which he got when he
[14:15] redeemed us. But we'll do it at the
[14:17] appointed time. Oh mind. We understand
[14:20] this is this is a process.
[14:22] The seventh seal is the ending of all
[14:24] things. It's even the ushering in of the
[14:26] millennium. And we so we see here when
[14:28] the the the it's at the end of the
[14:31] millennium. Then there's the white
[14:33] throne judgment. Then there's the new
[14:35] heaven and the new earth. So we have in
[14:37] in a in one sense the seventh seal is
[14:39] spanning over a thousand years of time.
[14:42] Amen.
[14:43] When we look at it that way. And so the
[14:45] full fruition
[14:47] of the seventh seal coming to totally to
[14:50] pass is when he fully claims his and
[14:54] totally
[14:56] redeems his possession.
[14:58] He's he's redeeming us now. Redemption
[15:00] is going on now unlike it has any other
[15:04] time because he's descended with an open
[15:06] book and he's revealing himself and he's
[15:08] manifesting himself in his bride, right?
[15:12] But he's going to he has to change our
[15:13] bodies still. That hasn't happened yet.
[15:15] And he's got to take possession of
[15:18] earth. He has the title deed, but he
[15:20] hasn't taken possession yet. It's still
[15:22] under Satan's dominion. But soon he will
[15:25] take take that dominion. Then he rules
[15:28] and reigns for a thousand years. Then he
[15:31] hands the kingdom back to the father.
[15:34] And then God becomes all in all in the
[15:36] new heaven and the new earth.
[15:37] Amen.
[15:39] Again,
[15:41] God does not, as we started several
[15:45] months ago, God does not bring us to a
[15:49] spiritual heaven to leave us somewhere
[15:53] off in the clouds. This is this is
[15:56] talking about redemption.
[15:58] It's bringing it back to its original
[16:00] condition. In fact, he brings it not
[16:02] only brings it back to its original
[16:04] condition, but he brings it to its
[16:06] mature condition. Because God's purpose
[16:08] wasn't to leave Adam and leave Adam and
[16:10] Eve in a position of innocence.
[16:13] Otherwise, why did he leave the devil
[16:14] there? His his purpose was to bring them
[16:18] from innocence to maturity.
[16:20] That had to take place. That was God's
[16:22] purpose from the very beginning.
[16:25] And because of sin, because of evil,
[16:28] well, God ordained it this way.
[16:31] If God could have made a better earth
[16:35] and a better plan, he would have done
[16:37] that. But his his in order for his
[16:39] attributes to be manifested,
[16:42] there has to be evil confronted by evil
[16:45] and sin and and sickness and fallen
[16:50] humanity.
[16:52] In order for you as his attribute to
[16:54] reach maturity, you also have to be
[16:57] confronted with evil and suffering and
[17:00] difficulties and trials because you'll
[17:02] never reach maturity without it.
[17:05] Amen.
[17:06] And then think about that further is in
[17:08] the zenith of Satan's Eden that we're
[17:12] living in. And it's hard to imagine that
[17:14] it could get more, but it will as long
[17:17] it will keep getting worse and worse
[17:19] until the rapture takes until Christ
[17:21] descends down on this earth and destroys
[17:24] the whole thing with his bride.
[17:27] But
[17:28] in this time where we can imagine it
[17:30] could get worse,
[17:32] he is perfecting his bride.
[17:34] It's not a coincidence. It's not by
[17:37] mistake. It's not it's not as though
[17:40] well just despite how bad it is I'm just
[17:42] going to figure it out. It's because in
[17:44] order to reach maturity you have to be
[17:47] confronted with this level of evil and
[17:50] deception.
[17:52] Right? It's not a mistake. It's created
[17:54] for you to become who you're supposed to
[17:58] be. Oh my. That's a whole other sermon.
[18:01] Acts 3:19. Repent ye therefore and be
[18:04] converted that your sins may be blotted
[18:06] out when the times of refreshing shall
[18:09] come from the presence of the Lord. And
[18:12] he
[18:14] and he shall send Jesus Christ which
[18:17] before was preached unto you.
[18:22] Whom the heaven must receive until the
[18:24] time of restitution or restoration of
[18:27] all things which God has spoken by the
[18:30] mouth of all his holy prophets since the
[18:32] world began. So there first must be a
[18:35] spiritual restoration. But there also
[18:38] must be a full physical restoration. So
[18:42] God spoke of the time where what he
[18:45] would be fully manifested in his people.
[18:48] That's God's purpose from the beginning.
[18:50] That's that's the first part of this.
[18:52] But the full part of this is God has
[18:54] promised that he would crush the head of
[18:56] the serpent.
[18:57] Amen.
[18:57] That he would destroy the works of the
[18:59] devil. So that means everything has to
[19:01] be restored.
[19:03] Amen.
[19:03] Not just you and me, not just the bride.
[19:06] Everything is going to be restored.
[19:08] That's what's promised and spoken by the
[19:11] mouth of his holy prophets since the
[19:12] world began.
[19:16] We were created to, again, it's the
[19:19] restoration of all things. We were
[19:22] created to live on an earth, not to
[19:24] float through heaven.
[19:26] Amen.
[19:27] We're created to have a perfect body on
[19:30] a perfect earth. We're created to take
[19:33] righteous dominion over it. and enjoy
[19:36] the glory of God on this earth
[19:40] without end.
[19:42] That's God's purpose. And again, and
[19:45] again following that principle, it's
[19:47] restoration. It's not destruction and
[19:50] recreation.
[19:51] Where is it destruction and recreation?
[19:53] It's always restoration.
[19:57] Romans 8:19, "For the earnest
[19:59] expectation of the creature, the
[20:01] creation, waits for the manifestation of
[20:04] the sons of God. For the creation was
[20:07] made subject to vanity, not willingly,
[20:10] but by reason of him who has subjected
[20:12] the same in hope."
[20:14] Amen.
[20:15] Because the creature or the creation
[20:17] itself also shall be delivered from the
[20:19] bondage of corruption into the glorious
[20:22] liberty of the children of God. For we
[20:24] know that the whole creation groans and
[20:26] travails in pain together until now. And
[20:31] not only they, but ourselves also, which
[20:33] have the first fruits of the spirit,
[20:36] even we ourselves grown within
[20:38] ourselves, waiting for the adoption to
[20:42] the redemption of our body. That is what
[20:45] the ultimate adoption is. We receive now
[20:48] the spirit of adoption, right? The
[20:52] ultimate adoption that we're going to
[20:53] receive is when this body is redeemed.
[20:56] Amen.
[20:56] But go back and and think about that
[20:58] again in the context is that this
[21:02] creation
[21:03] is groaning,
[21:05] right? How can how can it be that God
[21:08] destroys this planet, creates a new
[21:11] planet if this creation itself is the
[21:14] one that's groaning to be delivered from
[21:16] the bondage of corruption?
[21:18] that it wouldn't make sense to to say
[21:20] for Paul to write that this creation is
[21:23] groaning. He would just simply have to
[21:25] write, "Well, God's going to wipe this
[21:27] one out and restart all over again."
[21:30] That's not what he's saying. There needs
[21:31] to be a deliverance. This creation
[21:35] that's in bondage to evil, in bondage to
[21:38] the sin that we are committing
[21:41] must be delivered and set free. That's
[21:45] why it's not an a a a destruction and
[21:49] recreation, but it's it's a restoration.
[21:53] It's a transformation is another way to
[21:55] put it.
[21:58] Philippians 3:20, but we are citizens of
[22:00] heaven where the Lord Jesus Christ lives
[22:03] and we are eager eagerly waiting for him
[22:06] to return as our savior.
[22:08] Amen. He will take our weak mortal
[22:10] bodies and change them into glorious
[22:14] bodies like his own using the same power
[22:18] with which he will bring everything
[22:20] under his control.
[22:24] This very physical body that we're in
[22:27] will be changed. Again, I think what
[22:30] what what ends up happening is there's a
[22:32] whole uh philosophical history that goes
[22:35] into this from the Catholic Church on
[22:39] down. You know, if you look and study
[22:41] the history, um, in the early, you know,
[22:45] the the 3rd and 4th century, right
[22:49] around the time of the Nyine Council,
[22:51] there was many philosophers that ran
[22:55] schools of philosophy, whether it be in
[22:57] in Egypt, in Greece, in Rome, and
[23:02] different places actually converted to
[23:04] Christianity,
[23:06] but they didn't repent and leave their
[23:08] philosophical ical school. They turned
[23:10] it into a half philosophy and half half
[23:13] theology school. And so what these
[23:17] people did and you can see that as you
[23:19] read the early the the church fathers is
[23:22] they tried to amalgamate
[23:24] Plato and Aristotle into Christianity.
[23:29] And so this the idea in philosophy is
[23:33] that uh that which is incorporal or what
[23:38] we would say spiritual is good and that
[23:43] which is physical is evil. And so this
[23:47] this platonic principle of good and evil
[23:51] compared with physical and spiritual
[23:54] that understanding started to grab hold
[23:58] in the church. And as as you fast
[24:02] forward into that is the idea that
[24:05] heaven will be an incorporal place, a
[24:08] spiritual place. And so this idea comes
[24:12] along and so the viewpoint became that
[24:15] God will merely destroy this earth
[24:18] completely and we'll live in a truly
[24:21] good place which is only spiritual and
[24:24] we won't there people don't have bodies
[24:26] and all these different things and
[24:27] that's why you see brother Brandham
[24:28] saying I always was scared to go to
[24:30] heaven because I thought I would just be
[24:32] a little cloud a little spirit hanging
[24:34] there and so and of course popular media
[24:40] uh adopts this idea, puts it in the form
[24:43] of cartoons, then this idea starts to
[24:46] impact our minds and we think heaven is
[24:49] some other worldly place. That's not
[24:52] what God created. There's no picture of
[24:54] that in the Bible
[24:56] from the be at the beginning. He says
[24:58] there's an earth without sin. If you if
[25:00] you want to understand what heaven is
[25:02] like,
[25:04] picture this earth without sin and
[25:06] without evil, without pain, without
[25:09] sickness and without sorrow. This
[25:11] beautiful, I mean, it's so beautiful. We
[25:13] go, you go different places and you're
[25:14] just in awe of how beautiful this earth
[25:17] is. Just fathom what it would be without
[25:19] the second law of thermodynamics.
[25:22] just fathom what it would be without a
[25:24] devil tempting you and hurting people
[25:27] and bringing sickness and sorrow. That
[25:30] is what the earth is. And so that many
[25:33] of those things is is this
[25:36] popularizing of the Platonic mythology
[25:40] passed down through Catholicism and the
[25:42] Orthodox Church. It has created this
[25:46] idea especially for young people. Heaven
[25:48] is boring. We just we just sit in some
[25:53] uh boring place and stare at the wall
[25:55] forever. I mean, it's like this is so
[25:58] far from the reality.
[26:00] Amen.
[26:01] God made us to move.
[26:03] God made us to work. God made us to
[26:07] enjoy his creation.
[26:10] Amen.
[26:11] He gave us all things richly to enjoy.
[26:14] If he did that now, even under sin, just
[26:18] imagine what it is without sin. And and
[26:21] God God didn't create us to be sad and
[26:24] sorrowful. Now, godly sorrow leads to
[26:27] repentance. So, if there's sin in your
[26:29] life and you need to repent, understand
[26:31] there's going to be sorrow through those
[26:33] things and there's going to be sorrow.
[26:35] Jesus Jesus promises that. But the human
[26:38] heart wasn't created to be unhappy
[26:41] in the beginning. God takes and
[26:44] harnesses that unhappiness and that
[26:46] sorrow to accomplish his plan and
[26:49] purpose in our lives. But with that
[26:51] said, he didn't that's not his original
[26:54] plan and that's not how he's going to
[26:56] finish it. We are we are going to a
[26:59] place of joy. We're going to go to a
[27:01] place where our bodies will be able to
[27:03] move unlike anything we ever can
[27:05] imagine.
[27:07] And I'm getting way ahead of myself, but
[27:09] it's it's hard not to. You know, we're
[27:12] going to be at bodies that can fly
[27:14] through the air at terrific speed.
[27:16] Brother Brandham says
[27:17] we'll be able to pass through a wall.
[27:19] We'll be able to just by our thought be
[27:23] in what? Be in another place.
[27:25] Amen.
[27:26] It's hard for us to compre comprehend
[27:29] these things. I guess it's a little
[27:30] easier if you w if you've read any of
[27:33] the Marvel comics, but um I hope I don't
[27:38] encourage you to do that. But uh the
[27:41] these different things that we we see
[27:43] that people imagine in their minds is
[27:46] actually going to be a reality
[27:48] for the saints of all ages being in in
[27:51] in bodies that are uh impermeable to
[27:55] harm and damage.
[27:56] Amen.
[27:58] And it's it's things that we just can't
[28:00] fathom, can't comprehend. And he made
[28:03] our bodies to move. He made them to
[28:05] work. and he made it to be a place of
[28:09] joy.
[28:10] Amen.
[28:11] You know, um, young people often think
[28:14] it's a boring place. I think we h we
[28:17] really have to get that out of our
[28:19] minds. I think the number one problem is
[28:21] is that we miss the fact that even our
[28:24] worship services should be a place of
[28:27] just so much joy.
[28:29] Amen.
[28:30] So much rejoicing. just let go of all
[28:33] the fears and worries of what other
[28:35] people are talking about. Even even our
[28:37] worship shouldn't be just this boring
[28:40] stale thing where we're chanting out
[28:44] whatever
[28:45] uh form that we're supposed to be
[28:48] chanting. It's like really understand
[28:50] what God is doing for you and that the
[28:54] creator of the universe loves you. I
[28:56] mean, what what kind of joy should that
[28:59] create in our lives?
[29:01] Amen. Let's stand and pray.
[29:07] I don't know how many screens I got
[29:09] through, but I think I have 170 some and
[29:12] I probably only got through maybe 15 or
[29:15] 20 this time. So, we'll just keep going
[29:19] by his grace. So, Father, we just come
[29:22] to you, Lord, and we're so thankful for
[29:24] your promises, Lord. We're so thankful
[29:27] for the for the joy that it brings to
[29:29] our heart, Lord.
[29:31] Amen.
[29:32] We're so thankful, Lord, for your
[29:34] presence with us now, Lord, which is
[29:35] such an assurance of our eternal
[29:39] inheritance.
[29:41] Thank you, Lord. We ask your blessing
[29:44] upon each one, Lord. We ask your Holy
[29:46] Spirit would move through the the
[29:47] worship, through the preaching of the
[29:49] word, and that you'd be glorified, Lord.
[29:51] move every demon power out of the way,
[29:53] Lord, that your Holy Spirit can have
[29:56] free course in our hearts. We ask in
[29:57] Jesus name. Amen.
