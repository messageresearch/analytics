========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen God bless you Saints let's all just stand and have a word of prayer this morning amen let's just bow our hearts Heavenly Father Lord we're so grateful and so thankful Lord Jesus just to be gathered in your house this morning Father we pray that Lord you could be with us here Lord as we open up your word father we pray that you could be with Lord Pastor as he brings the word later on father I just pray that you'd be with the the listeners father the Lord the speakers father we love you now we ask all these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if we'd like to turn in our Bibles we're going to go to Jeremiah the 17th chapter this morning Jeremiah 17 we're going to read actually two portions of scripture out of Jeremiah amen so Jeremiah 17 we're going to start in the ninth verse and it says the the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it I the Lord search the heart I try the Reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doing and if we turn over in Jeremiah the 29th chapter just a few pages over it says Jeremiah 29 and vers um we'll start at verse 10 it says for thus saith the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place for I know the thoughts that I think towards you sayeth the Lord amen thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an an expected end then shall ye call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me now listen to this principle when you search for me with all of your heart and I will be found of you sayeth the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether I have driven you sayeth the Lord and I will bring you again to the place where I caused you to be carried away captive God bless you as you take your seats this morning I'm going to take a thought out of those two scriptures uh the thought is going to be examining the intentions examining the intentions of the wicked heart in the Book of Daniel which is the Captivity that Jeremiah is talking about here Daniel comes in the very beginning of the book with one of the most critical principles that we're supposed to take as Believers Daniel the first chapter the Lord actually had set things in motion for Daniel to have a position in the King's house I know some of us may be familiar with the story but the king had this decree to give them a daily provision of meat and wine and then at the end of the three years to bring the appointed ones before me but Daniel took the position in Daniel the 1st chapter: 8 he said said but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the Unix that he might not defile himself he purposed in his heart to serve the Lord and he chose the harder way in doing that and then throughout all the rest of Daniel's life this principle stayed with him the whole time brother enam says in the handwriting on the wall 1956 he said oh how tricky the devil is how Sly he is Friends watch him out in the scope of the little Ministry that the Lord has given me around the world in different nations and seeing that Sly hand of the devil so tricky how easy he can upset you and make it look like it's the truth yes sir the biggest lie that was ever told had the truth in it the first lie that was ever told had truth in it the first lie the devil told Eve had a lot of Truth in it said she would be open dyed she would have she would be wise she'd have more knowledge and all that was true then he said surely you'll not die but God said you would die so that just settles it keep true to the word and Daniel was going to purpose in his heart that he would be true to God and God's word and while he was down there the Lord could use him see how brother Bon put it while he was down there the Lord could use him why could he use Daniel because he had purposed in his heart and if you want to be used of God purpose in your heart that you'll love him and that you'll serve him and everything will be just fine amen Psalms 119 says wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed there unto according to the word with my whole heart have I sought thee oh let me not Wonder from thy Commandments Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee blessed art thou oh Lord teach me thy statutes and with my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth and I have rejoiced in the way of the of thy testimonies and as much as in all riches I will meditate in thy precepts and have respect under thy ways I will Delight myself in thy statutes I will not forget Thy word so the psalmist here declares you know how can I cleanse my way how you know he's this young man how can I how can I live an undefiled life you know I I have this yearning in my heart which I'm sure every one of us do this morning you have a yearning in your heart you want to live but for the Lord you want that Lord how can I do it how can I cleanse my ways it's one of the most simple yet most important principles of living that Christian Life it's laid within that verse it says take heed according to Thy Word in another translation it says by guarding it according to your word in other words staying focused tying it to your bed post as David would put it you know just as as uh the opening scripture says says in Jeremiah seeking him with your whole heart the Amplified Bible puts it like this with my whole heart have I sought you this is Psalms 119 the 10th verse in the Amplified with my whole heart have I sought you inquiring for and of you and yearning for me or yearning for you now look at how they put this next verse oh let me not Wonder or step aside either in ignorance or willfully from your Commandments in ignorance or willfully just laying this kind of a foundation here if we if just kind of going to bounce around here if that's all right but God looks at the heart the Lord came to Samuel the prophet in the Old Testament while he was searching for the right king of Israel he told him don't look at the countenance of a man don't look at the outward but rather know that I look at the heart of a man 1st Samuel 16:7 says but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance nor the height of his stature because because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as a man seeth for a man lookth on the outward but the Lord lookth on the heart thank the Lord for that I know you know I'm I'm jumping around here but we're going to look at a man in the Bible there was a man in the Bible by the name of balum that I'd look at like to look at this morning balum actually had a prophetic gift of operate you operating in his life and at that time in history just to set the background of events for a moment Israel was on the move and the rumor of the victories that the Lord had manifested among them were beginning to spread through those neighboring Nations the battle the battles won against the Canaanites and the amorites had spread through the land and the Israelites were actually in route to the land of Moab and the moabit king at the time was a man by the name of Balo son of zippor and he was desperately afraid the Bible says of the Israelites because of their numbers and because they he knew that they had defeated those neighboring Nations so he heard of a prophet that had a good reputation numbers 226 says come now therefore I pray thee curse me this people for they are too Mighty for me per Adventure I shall Prevail that we might Smite them that and I and that I may drive them out of the land for i w that ye whom thou blessed is blessed and whom thou cursed is cursed so he recognized the gift that was operating in balam's life and he said I know that whatever you bless balum is blessed and I know whatever you curse is cursed so I'm going to take that gift I I I want you to come to my nation and I want you to curse this nation that's going to come up a rise rise against me Bayo Bao knew Bayo knew from the beginning what his intentions are he he said from the from the beginning I want you to curse this nation and balum started off with what seemed to be right he inquired of the Lord and the scripture says the message of the message message from God was plain and simple God said unto balum Thou shalt not go unto them numbers 22:12 Thou shalt not curse this people for they are blessed so he got the word from the Lord he inquired of the Lord he got the word of the Lord and he told uh balum told The Messengers look I can't go what God God says is blessed I can't go and curse What God Says is blessed so he sent the messengers away um but that didn't stop the the king of Moab so then he sent I know this is probably a familiar a familiar story for most of us but he then sent another group of Messengers over to balum but for this time he had a more enticing offer I will promote you he says to unto great honor and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me come therefore I pray thee and curse me this people and you see this the request was the same as before but this time he came with something greater you know I I I'll I'll give you what you want I'll give you I'll give you land I'll give you riches I'll give you these things and instead of balum sticking to what God had said the first time he inquired of the Lord again this time the Lord said to balum go ahead and go and brother Brandon picks this up and shows that you know God's word the first time was God's perfect will and his word the second time was his permissive will because he wanted to balam obviously had it in his heart to go and so the Lord wasn't going to wasn't going to stop that he just said now look brother Brenham says in the children of Israel 19 47 now look there is a perfect will of God there's a permissive will of God and God permitted his Prophet to go yet it wasn't his perfect will it was his permissive will and that's because God doesn't want to force us any into anything he told he said bam you can go and you do this but if you choose to do that you can only prophesy the words that I give unto you you see the Lord searched the heart and the intentions of Bam's heart and brother Brenham refers to Bam and we know know this probably uh very familiar he refers to him as a hirling prophet even though out of his mouth were coming words of Prophecy that what the Lord had said um his actions proved that somewhere in his heart he wanted to go down to Moab he wanted to go do that and uh you know his heart wasn't focused on the the right thing you see that's why we can't ever base our uh base things solely on feelings or base things on intentions because you could have the purest of intentions and it not being according to the word right you could have the purest intentions in your heart maybe you know just to bring it down to our level maybe to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't know the Lord and you have intentions in your heart that you know down the road that you know I want this person to be of God but and those intentions are good but it's not lying up with what God's word says be not unequally yolked you want them to come to the Lord and that you know that old saying follow your heart you know that's just a lie from the enemy Jeremiah teaches us as we read that your heart is deceitful and wicked above all things you see and even when you're born again of the spirit of God brother Matt was talking on it Wednesday night wonderful sermon you you still have that sticky nature right you still have that thing and sometimes your flesh man the Fallen nature that you still live in sometimes it leads you somewhere and thinking you know the whole time that it's the right decision and you have the purest intentions but it's out of God's perfect will even when you're born again of the spirit of God because we live in the Fallen nature that we live in right so and then you can enter into the land of God's permissive will I know I never want to be in that land um just to go through some of some more of the story with Baum he says um after going back to the Lord and asking again again the Lord allows him to make his own decision so scripture says that he saddled his donkey he departed towards Moab and it says that the Lord's anger was kindled against BM and you know just to take that from a different angle for a moment you know the Lord's anger was kindled against him because God cares about you he cares about the decisions you make he cares about the path that you take he doesn't want you to go down his permissive will because he sees his thoughts are higher than our thoughts his ways are higher than our ways so he sees that that path is going to lead to something so destructive in your life so his anger was kindled against balam because maybe you know he saw what was going to come about this later on read balam ends up being on the side of Moab and being being slain with with the enemies in the enemy's land and in the Book of Revelation you know it he's made an example of you know he he was just used used by the enemy God cares so much about you scripture says he formed you before before he formed you in the womb he knew you and he crafted out your life so going further with the story you know the angel of the Lord anoints the eyes of a donkey you know the donkey saw the angel standing in the way and three different times the donkey turned aside from the path three warnings from the Lord to stay clear of this destructive path but balam's eyes were so fixated on something that you know maybe he thought in his own life would have been you know something constructive but he was so fixated he had the wrong int maybe he had the right intentions but his heart was in the wrong place maybe maybe he thought the Lord could use this situation for good and finally after striking the the the donkey several times starting to kill it know that story quite a funny story actually the Lord anointed the donkey to speak to balam and while he was speaking to the donkey the Lord actually opened balam's eyes to see the angel numbers 22 it says the Lord opened the mouth of the ass and he said unto balum what have I done unto thee that thou smitten me these three times bam said to the ass because thou has mocked me I would that there would be a sword in mine hand for now I would kill thee and the ass said unto balam am I not an ass upon that thou which has ridden ever since I was thine unto this day was I ever want to do so unto thee and he said nay then the Lord opened the eyes of balum and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in his way and his sorn drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and fell flat on his face and the angel of the Lord said unto him wherefore H hast thou smitten thine n these three times behold I went out to withstand thee because look listen to this because thy way is perverse before me and immediately balam fell to the ground he worshiped the Lord and just to uh save just some time here the Lord asked him why are you going to go into this place when I clearly told you the first time not to go um you know balam's answer spoke of his intentions if it displeases you Lord then I can turn around but you see all those warnings all those things you know God still let him chose his own path bam said unto the angel of the Lord I have sinned um and the angel of the Lord said unto balum go with the men but only the word that I speak unto you Thou shalt speak so balum went with the princes of baac and he went there and we see where it led balum eventually he gave in he helped the moabites give counsel against the Israelites and what happened to balum not much later we find him on that side slain um numbers 31 and they slew the king of Midian um five Kings of Midian balam also the sons of beor they slew with the sword um Joshua 13 says balum also the son of beor the soothsayer the Bible says did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them and they were slain by the Israelites and we find him in Revelation 2 as an example he it says because but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught Balo to cast a stumbling in Block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so you see now in Revelation years later that what had happened is that balum had actually given in and and given Bayo something to to cast a stumbling block before Israel right what did balum do in this story is he didn't hold the word of the Lord he didn't take heed according to the word as that scripture says and it wasn't first and foremost in his life a commentator writes God sees your heart so heed his call and this Wayward uh bent of balam's heart that continued in wickedness is a telling tale of the inability to hide our hearts from god wow even in the New Testament we see the true character of balum recalled in first second Peter the second chapter um but he was rebuked for the wrongdoing by a donkey an animal without speech who spoke with a human voice and restrain the prophet's Madness second Peter chapter 2 so he sees your heart amen and he knows that there will be times where it does Lead You astray because he knows that we live in that Fallen flesh but he doesn't leave you there to stay thank the Lord Psalms 139 says oh Lord thou has searched me and known me search me oh God and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and Lead Me into the way Everlasting amen look at David's attitude there Lord search me know my heart try me try my thoughts I you know I have this I have this thought on My Heart Lord I have this intention and Lord it seems to be pure it seems to line up with your word it seems to be pure to its core but Lord I'm going to check it with your word anyway Lord please just come and come and manifest yourself to me and make sure that there wouldn't be any wicked way found in me amen cuz the Lord sees the path he sees the beginning of the path and he sees the end of the path so maybe he can discern something in your life that will cause you to not stumble down the road amen the Lord so often times sends his word to correct our path you know he makes his he makes it straight you know but God doesn't ever Force his word on us just just as we read in there in with balum he you know he sent the prophecy he sends the angels to warn him then he anoints the animal but he still chose his own way and in those situations where you know you think that you're just you're on that path we have to Humble ourselves enough and keep our pride in check in those situations and be ready and willing to make those paths straight amen and because our intentions even though driven by the sincere heart and the psalmist says how can a young man cleanse his ways take heed according to the word even if it stops you in your tracks take heed according to the word and do what Daniel did and purpose in Your Heart Take Jeremiah's instruction seek him with your whole heart this story actually reminded me of the the Rich Young Ruler when brother Brenham dives into that story and shows that the rich man that looked up from Heaven uh you know that was correlated with the Rich Young Ruler the Lord searched out his heart and there was something in there that was taking him from fully surrendering we did a Sunday school on it several weeks ago but he searched his heart saw his possessions held a higher standard in his life than the Lord did and he never did surrender to that thing and then one day the Lord saw uh saw him looking up begging for a glass of cold water and he he asked Abraham please send someone to warn my brothers Abraham said if they won't believe the prophets they'll never believe me if I send someone from the grave Luke 16 he says I pray thee father that thou would send some someone to my father's house for I have five Brethren that he may testify unto them lest they come under this place of torment and Abraham said they have Moses and the prophets let them hear that and they said nay Father Abraham but if one went up from the dead they will repent and he said if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one raise from the dead the Lord sends his word he you know he sent his word to balum he he sends everything that he can according to the word he even opens up the eyes of balum on his path to see the angel of the Lord and yet balum still did not surrender and heed to that word you know the rich man tried to send someone from the grave to to to to to warn his brothers but we can see that you know their even if even if someone rose up from the grave Abraham said if they won't take heed according to Thy word from the prophets and from the word that I give on the earth even if I raise someone up from the dead they won't give heed to it you know and um it says that scripture that to try your Reigns that scripture means to examine your secret motives and interestingly enough it's the verse right after the Lord tells us that our heart is deceitful and wicked above all things so he gives us the the word and and then he gives us the answer to the word and each and every time if we can take heed according to that word and examine our hearts Jeremiah 15:16 says thy words were found and I did eat them and Thy Word was unto me the joy and the rejoicing of my heart for I am called by thy name oh Lord God of hosts that that scripture your words were found and I ate them I read this commentary and it really struck me the other day it says I have said that Jeremiah lets us into a secret his outer life consisting of his Perpetual faithful Ministry was to be accounted for By His inward love of the word which he preached if you go back and you read the the book of Jeremiah just just recently got done reading it it's time after time there there's prophecy after prophecy a warning after warning and you know there it gets to a point where Jeremiah gets so discouraged in one of the chapters he gets so discouraged that he says I can't even I can't even talk about you anymore Lord I I can't even prophesy in your name anymore I'm so discouraged in my heart but then he says but their words were found as as a fire in my bones because I can't not prophesy I can't not give the word and his inward love of that word which he preached gives us something that we can look to and we can we can the the commentary keep goes on to say it is a very different thing from saying Thy Word was found and I did admire it or Thy Word was found and I did criticize it or Thy Word was found and I did divide it and make a sermon out of it that is a Minister's Temptation you know how many times can our hearts be honest and say that we found his word we heard his word we heard what was preached and we did eat it we didn't we didn't just listen to it and admire it with just a a solemn heart but we ate it and we allowed it to digest into our inward man amen Psalms 1 says blessed is the man that we just got a few minutes left blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night amen Psalms 1119 says teach me oh Lord the way of thy statutes and I shall keep it unto my end give me understanding and I shall keep thy law yay I shall observe it with my whole heart make me to go into the path of thy Commandments for therein do I Delight incline my heart unto thy testimonies and not to covetousness so he sees David sees that you know sometimes my heart can be inclined to Covetous things but I want you Lord to Incline my heart unto thy testimonies the Bible says turn away mine eyes from beh holding vanity and listen to this word and Quicken thou me in thy way establish Thy word unto thy servant who is devoted to thy fear turn away thy approach for thy judgments are good behold I have longed after thy precepts quicken in me thy righteousness that word Quicken means to make alive so we pray the prayer to Quicken and make alive thy way and thy rightous in us and so then when we have those intentions when we are on a path it doesn't matter what path that you're on we have to make sure that we keep this word ever before us and we constantly check it with Lord is this is this where you want me to be is this where you need me to be Lord then we then we have to submit our pride a little bit and just say Lord I I'm on this path and it seems so right it seems my intentions are so proper but Lord I don't know for sure so can you look down for me and then can you Quicken me in thy righteousness what was balam's mistake he didn't trust God's word he didn't seek him with his whole heart he didn't follow these statutes and neither did that the Rich Young Ruler but those that did they knew that the only way that it could be done is help from the almighty amen establishing Thy Word in thy heart says the psalmist turn my way eyes from beholding in vanities you know we can't check our decisions I said this before but we can't check our decisions or the road that you're on uh you know with how pure your intentions are or perceive something to be how it may look on the outside we have to check it with the word what does God's word say about it have you prayed about it you know your heart your flesh man it's wicked in every way it leads you away from trusting God just because that's the nature of our of our inward of our outward man it points you down sometimes the wrong direction you know it compromises because compromise sometimes is just the easier way to go it doesn't even you know you don't sometimes choose I'm going to compromise it just sometimes seems like the easier the the easier of two paths to take so then your flesh man will then go down that path amen but if you set your focus on the right thing and you bring that flesh man into captivity and if you set your heart to search only the word and seek him with your your entire heart the Bible says that he will be found of you saith the Lord even if you take the wrong road sometimes even if your heart leads you astray if you're willing to submit he will lead you into the way Everlasting amen glory to God let's all stand together this morning Heavenly Father Lord we're thankful and grateful for your word this morning Father we pray that you could just anoint the song leader as he comes out here father anoint the musicians Lord Jesus pray you could just father Lord set your uh your presence here father be welcomed here I pray in the name of Jesus Lord we love you and ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless youall for [Music]
