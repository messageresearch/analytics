[5:27] and continuing on speaking about a word
[5:30] family and we're looking at 1
[5:34] Thessalonians 5 and verse
[5:41] 14 I will therefore that the younger
[5:44] women marry bear children guide the
[5:46] house give none occasion to the
[5:48] adversary to speak reproachfully let's
[5:52] pray Heavenly Father we just come before
[5:54] you now and we want to commit this time
[5:56] to you in the name of Jesus Christ and
[5:58] we ask that you'd be with us Lord that
[6:01] you'd take your word and and place it
[6:04] correctly in our hearts Lord as we
[6:06] approach this topic we ask for your
[6:08] anointing and your wisdom for each one
[6:10] of us we ask in Jesus name amen you be
[6:16] seated
[6:18] so we're living I believe in an hour
[6:21] that is so twisted and perverted the
[6:25] minds of people that it's almost
[6:28] difficult to rise above it see above it
[6:31] see through it see through the
[6:33] deception but I believe that's what the
[6:36] preaching of the word is and that's what
[6:38] the Holy Ghost will guide us and lead us
[6:41] into each of us as
[6:44] individuals um if you look at 1 Timothy
[6:47] chapter 5 of course we understand he's
[6:50] speaking about the uh uh the widows and
[6:56] who should be taken in to the number of
[6:59] support
[7:00] for Elisha God bless you he's uh he's
[7:04] our friend from Minnesota he's in the uh
[7:07] uh in the Army in Georgia and I I I hope
[7:10] we'll see him here and there so really
[7:13] good to see you amen
[7:16] um so looking at looking at this he's
[7:20] speaking about who should be taken into
[7:23] the the number of widows who that we
[7:25] support so if if the conditions are met
[7:29] then she should be taken into that but
[7:31] Paul is saying not not the younger women
[7:33] don't just take all the widows in if
[7:36] they have family if the F if the man
[7:39] doesn't support his F his extended
[7:42] family says he's denied the faith and
[7:44] worse than an Infidel that's another
[7:46] part in there then he goes forward and
[7:48] says and about the younger women this is
[7:50] what I want them to do because they're
[7:53] widows their husbands passed away they
[7:54] have every right to remarry says marry
[7:57] bear children and guide the home
[8:00] right and so when we look at this we can
[8:03] understand this isn't actually just a
[8:06] command concerning widows it's not like
[8:09] well the the younger widows should
[8:11] remarry but you know the younger sisters
[8:14] no no don't don't do that do something
[8:17] else so when we can re when we can kind
[8:19] of get that context of that and
[8:22] understand go God's purpose for
[8:25] Womanhood we've spent Five series
[8:28] looking at what Womanhood is the purpose
[8:31] of Womanhood the vision of Womanhood and
[8:36] it's so it's so critical I believe in
[8:38] this hour just to say it
[8:41] direct why is the vision for young
[8:45] ladies to go and get a career I I don't
[8:48] know why that has become a permeating
[8:51] thing I'm not saying that's 100% of
[8:53] people but as as I observe and listen to
[8:56] people talk the first vision is I must
[8:59] find college and a career the heart of
[9:03] motherhood somehow becomes missing in
[9:06] such an hour there should be in a nurt a
[9:10] family should nurture and encourage and
[9:14] put in front of their daughters the
[9:17] glory of motherhood the glory of
[9:21] homemaking the glory of being a wife and
[9:23] a mother and that it isn't something to
[9:25] be ashamed of or oh oh you know uh I
[9:29] have to apologize because I don't have a
[9:32] career I just stayed at home with my
[9:34] children like it's something to be
[9:35] ashamed of the other part is to be the
[9:38] part to be ashamed of is that we're that
[9:40] our culture is producing a bunch of girl
[9:43] bosses that want to work on spreadsheets
[9:46] in some man's office instead
[9:49] of understanding the greatness of the
[9:52] calling that God has placed upon women
[9:55] to keep a home to be mothers
[9:59] to take care of children it is the
[10:02] greatest thing that a woman can do and
[10:05] it is her highest calling now I
[10:07] understand there circumstances and
[10:09] situations and we'll read brother
[10:10] brandham speaks about
[10:12] that but again the circumstances aren't
[10:15] and situations aren't well the American
[10:17] culture demands it our society it's
[10:20] difficult to do it any other way well I
[10:23] mean being a Christian is difficult so
[10:25] should you just become a liberal
[10:28] Christian I'm a liberal Christian cuz
[10:30] it's easier for me to be woke slch
[10:32] Christian at the same time how far
[10:34] should we take this descent into
[10:38] apostasy how about we not take the
[10:41] Descent how how about we stand on God's
[10:43] word and say this is what the word says
[10:46] even if I have to drink as the prophet
[10:49] said lay in the street and drink Branch
[10:51] water and eat soda crackers I will
[10:54] follow God's word regardless of what
[10:58] comes
[11:00] not to look every situation and say
[11:02] that's an exception that's an exception
[11:03] here's an exception here's another
[11:06] exception no we we can't look at it at
[11:09] like that and we can't approach it like
[11:11] that if we're restored back to the
[11:14] original faith I believe this is part of
[11:16] the original faith and I'm going to read
[11:18] some things today the way brother
[11:20] brandham speaks and it's going to offend
[11:22] the modern mindset badly but let it be
[11:26] so let it be so because the reality is
[11:29] the modern mindset doesn't work it's not
[11:32] functional our society is broken and
[11:35] it's literally on the scent on on the
[11:37] direction of total
[11:40] disintegration if you even look at you
[11:43] you say well it doesn't matter that much
[11:45] even uh the birth rates in America are
[11:49] crumbling so much that if the Lord
[11:52] terries and there's a few generation 100
[11:54] 120 years from
[11:56] now there's not going to be
[11:59] and America based upon the the the birth
[12:02] rates here there's not going to be a
[12:04] Europe based upon the birth rates right
[12:07] now so understand
[12:09] that this is very important not just to
[12:14] us as individuals but to societies to
[12:17] the Christian faith as a whole God does
[12:20] not want us with the attitude that
[12:22] children are a burden if we have the
[12:25] mindset children are a burden children
[12:27] are difficult I'd rather have a cat
[12:30] oh I'd rather have a
[12:31] dog and as as the prophet said women are
[12:35] have the nature to mother so they're
[12:37] going to they're probably mother their
[12:38] husband and their cat amen instead of
[12:42] mothering what God has ordained for them
[12:45] to mother and it's it's not it's a
[12:48] shameful thing that our society has come
[12:50] to this place that children are burdened
[12:53] they're difficult and uh I saw I saw a
[12:56] little thing on social media the other
[12:58] day and it said in the past
[13:01] uh people looked at it was I'll have as
[13:04] many children as God will God
[13:07] wills and now it's like well I have cats
[13:11] and dogs that's all I need in the past
[13:15] in the past they would say you know we
[13:18] we look at we look at the world and we
[13:20] don't have enough rain and our crops are
[13:22] suffering let's go sacrifice our
[13:24] children to molok is has things haven't
[13:27] changed amen right at all they say we
[13:30] have global warming let's go abort all
[13:32] the children amen it's the same exact
[13:35] Spirit yes the spirit of molok on the
[13:38] world and upon the nation and it's
[13:41] disgusting amen uh the if you look at
[13:44] the number one issue for women in
[13:46] America if you want to find out why
[13:48] brother brandham said women shouldn't
[13:49] have the vote number one issue for women
[13:51] in America is I want to be able to kill
[13:54] my unborn baby amen that's right amen
[13:58] can you imagine that
[14:00] it is it is the world that we live in
[14:03] it's disgusting it's perverted it's men
[14:05] have refused to be men and women have
[14:08] been refused to be women and even
[14:10] Christian women are scared to boldly
[14:14] Proclaim this is God's purpose and will
[14:18] and function for me and men are scared
[14:21] to step out in faith and say I will
[14:23] provide for my home you're not going to
[14:25] work but but but it's going to be hard
[14:28] okay
[14:29] fine let it be so I'd rather it be hard
[14:32] and do it God's way than it to be easy
[14:34] and do it the world's
[14:37] way questions and answers brother
[14:39] brandham has asked brother brandham are
[14:41] women allowed to work in public affairs
[14:42] when they have a healthy husband and
[14:44] children I'm asking this question for
[14:46] someone
[14:49] else
[14:52] okay this person's hoping that brother
[14:55] brandom will preach on these people that
[14:57] are sitting in in the place
[14:59] place he says well I I I don't know
[15:02] about that I can't say but I just have
[15:04] this feeling let me say this I believe
[15:07] if I was a woman and I know that my
[15:09] husband was healthy and had a good job
[15:10] working I believe it would be a great
[15:13] pleasure to me to stay home take care of
[15:15] my children and make the and take care
[15:17] of my children and raise them up and to
[15:19] love the Lord and if I had any time from
[15:21] Washington things that I was going to do
[15:23] I think I would teach my children how to
[15:26] serve the Lord now if you've got a debt
[15:29] or something you're trying to help your
[15:30] husband pay for or something like you
[15:32] have to do well I think that's fine if
[15:34] you'll try to help him and you live a
[15:36] lady and I I think it's hard no man
[15:38] that's got good understanding wants his
[15:41] wife to get it in a bunch where there's
[15:43] a bunch of vulgar dirty men and things
[15:45] like that but if woman has to get in
[15:47] that I think that she ought her husband
[15:48] ought to know that she's a genuine
[15:50] Christian that can that can be trusted a
[15:53] trustworthy woman but now as to say that
[15:56] she shouldn't work I don't know see
[15:58] there's no scripture to back that up I'm
[16:00] just passing that opinion but I think if
[16:02] a woman wants to work and she wants to
[16:05] now I'm certainly against women working
[16:06] in these offices where all these
[16:08] businessmen they carry on tell them
[16:10] dirty jokes and a nice clean woman
[16:12] sitting there and all these smudy dirty
[16:14] things told around like that I'm against
[16:17] that I think you ought to come out from
[16:19] among such stuff as that but now if a
[16:22] woman can hold herself as a real lady
[16:23] and trying to help her husband do
[16:25] something to meet some clothes for the
[16:26] kids to go to school or pay off a bill
[16:29] or something like that and she wants to
[16:30] work till that's over now this is not
[16:33] the Lord cuz I don't have scripture for
[16:34] this I'm just saying that' be my opinion
[16:37] but otherwise I wouldn't think just CU
[16:38] she wants to work just to run around and
[16:40] have or more money to spend run around
[16:43] and run to barrooms or drink smoke and
[16:45] carry on I don't think she should do it
[16:47] I think she should stay home try to be a
[16:49] lady and take care of her house
[16:54] amen and so
[16:56] again looking at this he's bringing
[16:59] forth the exceptions and when he
[17:00] preaches on this directly in the sermons
[17:02] he'll mention from time to time the
[17:05] exceptions difficulties trials hardships
[17:10] and at the same time we can take that as
[17:14] permission to do whatever we want to do
[17:17] and again we have the perfect will of
[17:19] God and the permissive will of God we've
[17:21] gotten out into our life in a situation
[17:23] it doesn't mean go out and run up a
[17:26] bunch of debt and overspend and say my
[17:28] wife's got to work work forever that's
[17:30] right amen this is like and brother
[17:32] bram's put putting it in the sense of
[17:35] let her do that until right until the
[17:39] thing is taken care of it's not let her
[17:42] do that
[17:43] forever right all right so let's
[17:46] continue to
[17:47] read he says now I'm not much of this
[17:50] modernistic taste of women working when
[17:53] I see these women with these Uniforms on
[17:55] riding around in the city on motorcycles
[17:57] as police it's a disgrace to any City
[18:00] that will let a woman do that see see as
[18:03] many men that's without work it shows
[18:05] the modern thinking of our city it shows
[18:07] the degrading we don't have to have them
[18:10] women out there like that they ain't got
[18:11] no business out there like that when God
[18:14] gave a man a wife he gave him the best
[18:15] thing he could give him outside of
[18:17] salvation but one when one goes to
[18:19] trying to take a man's place then she's
[18:21] about the worst thing that he could get
[18:23] a hold of now that's
[18:26] right amen
[18:28] she's got no place in a defense plant a
[18:31] woman's got place is at home with her
[18:34] children and when she now if her
[18:36] husband's sick she has to work that's
[18:37] different but Woman's Place is at home
[18:40] in the kitchen and when she leaves that
[18:42] she's out of her place exactly
[18:46] right continuing on there's there's
[18:48] quite a number of quotes it'll be a lot
[18:49] of reading so just bear with me when I
[18:52] say this with with respect ladies when a
[18:55] woman gets out of the kitchen she's out
[18:56] of her place that's right that's where
[18:58] she belongs outside of that she has no
[19:01] place and now I'm not hard on them but I
[19:03] just tell what's the truth and what the
[19:05] Bible used to be the man was the head of
[19:07] the house but that was in Bible days he
[19:09] isn't no more he's a puppet or or the
[19:12] babysitter or something and now they
[19:14] want to take care of the dogs practice
[19:15] birth control and pack a little old dog
[19:17] around in their arms all the time so you
[19:19] can run around all night I'm not talking
[19:22] about mother God bless them that's what
[19:24] holds the nation together halfway is a
[19:27] real good sacred God God saved mother
[19:29] that's right but the shame of how
[19:31] degraded that our women is I got a piece
[19:33] out of the paper I cut after this world
[19:35] war number two that said where has the
[19:38] morals of the American women gone that
[19:40] after 6 months overseas four out of five
[19:43] soldiers was divorced from their wives
[19:45] and they had married some other man and
[19:47] couldn't even wait for them to come back
[19:48] from overseas soldiers over there dying
[19:51] on the battlefield that person that does
[19:53] that is not worthy to be called mother
[19:55] that sacred name no it isn't so I've
[19:57] always been called woman hater but I'm
[19:59] not I think a woman is a wonderful thing
[20:01] and a mother especially but they should
[20:03] be their places and not take the place
[20:05] of man and not take the place of God
[20:09] amen
[20:11] amen Titus
[20:13] 2 again this is Paul's instructions to a
[20:18] uh to Titus on setting the church in
[20:21] order setting the families in order and
[20:25] so he comes and says the aged women
[20:27] likewise that they be in Behavior as
[20:29] becometh Holiness not false accusers not
[20:32] given to much wine teachers of good
[20:35] things so not only your lives but your
[20:38] words should be teachers of good things
[20:41] not teaching the men
[20:44] right that they may teach the young
[20:46] women to be sober to love their husbands
[20:49] to love their children to be discreet
[20:52] chased keepers at home good obedient to
[20:55] their own husbands that the word of God
[20:58] be not
[20:59] blasphemed it's amazing to me as we look
[21:02] at this and uh there is a place where
[21:06] the older sisters should be giving the
[21:08] vision of Womanhood to the younger
[21:11] generation amen not just by example but
[21:15] by words and by plotting forth the
[21:19] direction of a young of of the do of
[21:22] their daughters lives showing them
[21:24] teaching them training them how to be a
[21:28] god godly woman am and it it I'll just
[21:32] say it there's no sign of University
[21:35] there's no sign of going after a career
[21:37] the career of
[21:39] Womanhood is being a mother is being a
[21:43] wife is being a homemaker this is the
[21:47] biblical Vision it doesn't matter what
[21:50] culture says and cultures all around the
[21:53] world teach perverted things amen but
[21:56] God's word brings not bondage but real
[22:01] Freedom you know is it the it's come to
[22:05] this place where the modern feministic
[22:08] mindset has said how can you be in
[22:11] bondage to be a homemaker you you you
[22:15] mean to tell me you're going to stay at
[22:18] home and serve your husband and take
[22:21] care of your children and take care of
[22:23] the home I mean look at
[22:26] me I work for a corporate operation I'm
[22:29] climbing the corporate ladder and I'm
[22:32] all alone all by myself and I get to do
[22:34] whatever I want to
[22:36] do it sounds like one person that's
[22:39] saying the other person's in bondage is
[22:41] actually in bondage themselves to a
[22:43] system that's destroying them perverting
[22:46] them and turning them into something
[22:48] that they're not even designed by
[22:50] almighty God to be and that's that's at
[22:53] that's at the core of understanding this
[22:56] this is not A Woman's Place is not a
[23:00] result of the fall and of sin it is a
[23:03] result of God's created
[23:05] order a woman being hurt and abused 100%
[23:09] is a result of the fall and of of sin a
[23:13] woman rebelling against headship is a
[23:16] result of the fall and of sin but a
[23:19] woman being the the nurturing ground the
[23:21] betting grounds of life is not a result
[23:24] of the fall this is God's original
[23:27] design or original creation she's under
[23:30] headship because God created her second
[23:34] secondly after after Adam Adam was
[23:38] created what did Adam do God brought the
[23:40] animals in front of them he named them
[23:42] it shows Authority then he brought then
[23:45] he brought forth from him what the woman
[23:50] her she's named woman why is she named
[23:52] woman cuz she's taken out of man who
[23:56] named her woman
[23:58] her husband it shows Authority not only
[24:01] did he name her then he gave her another
[24:03] name later Hava which means the
[24:07] lifegiver so twice he named his wife for
[24:11] her purpose and for her function woman
[24:14] was not woman was made for the man this
[24:18] is what Paul says this is the clear
[24:20] order of creation he was alone it wasn't
[24:22] good that he was alone and he couldn't
[24:24] multiply himself so God took from Adam's
[24:26] side and made him a helper amen for a
[24:31] woman to enter into that position as a
[24:35] helper as a mother and as as as a
[24:39] homemaker she's actually entering into
[24:43] the position she was created
[24:46] for this was God's original creation
[24:49] God's original
[24:50] purpose and when we can really
[24:53] understand that as the prophet said it
[24:55] wasn't so from the beginning right but
[24:58] it will be at the end because the
[25:00] restoration of the word in the bride
[25:04] it's not enough to just talk about it or
[25:07] say Amen to it at some point we have to
[25:11] come in subjection to it and live it
[25:13] amen
[25:14] Amen brother brandom says put the woman
[25:17] back in the kitchen where she belongs
[25:19] then everything will be all right but
[25:21] you put her out in the public work she's
[25:23] gone and I don't I don't say that the
[25:26] American woman Snicker up their nose and
[25:28] say there's nothing to that and you show
[25:31] me certainly you've got to do it because
[25:32] the Bible predicted you would do it you
[25:35] have to do
[25:36] it and here when it used to be a long
[25:38] time ago in a Methodist Church if a
[25:40] woman cut her hair she was put out of
[25:41] the church certainly they did it yes
[25:43] indeed he Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness
[25:45] Pentecostals all of them used to do it
[25:47] what happened you know why you got some
[25:49] sissies behind the pulpit that's exactly
[25:51] right somebody's afraid their meal
[25:53] ticket afraid you'd excommunicate them
[25:55] run them out of the church they didn't
[25:58] have the very audacity to stand stand on
[26:00] God's word whether it Hur or whether it
[26:02] didn't that's exactly right listen here
[26:04] the man is the ruler don't you think
[26:06] you'll rule the house you're the ruler
[26:08] of the house you're absolutely you're
[26:10] not a slave now but you're a helpmate
[26:12] and Adam the man has ruled over his wife
[26:14] and he's responsible solely for his wife
[26:17] God makes the man answer for his knife
[26:20] for his wife now you read and see if it
[26:23] says that now absolutely the truth and
[26:27] we have such a problem in that's
[26:29] proliferated now in our society that all
[26:33] of the church world has feminized
[26:36] church and church services the the
[26:39] worship is touchy feely feminine
[26:42] appealing worship and the men sitting
[26:45] there going what in the world is this
[26:47] song weird song
[26:49] about Jesus is not my
[26:53] boyfriend he's my Lord and Savior he's
[26:56] my king amen
[26:58] and yes we are the bride to the
[27:01] bridegroom but not everything in the
[27:04] scripture is presented in a feminized
[27:08] way and church isn't to to lean only
[27:12] towards it it certainly meets the needs
[27:14] of sisters right but it also meets the
[27:18] need of men meets the need of their
[27:20] heart the need the the those needs are
[27:24] different the approach is different and
[27:27] God meets
[27:29] need but it isn't a cissified
[27:32] gospel it isn't a feminized gospel it's
[27:36] a it's a manly
[27:39] gospel it's one that produces strength
[27:42] that produces not a jellyfish amen but a
[27:46] solid rock standing there upon the rock
[27:48] of
[27:51] Revelation what business has a woman got
[27:54] being a police policeman wrestling with
[27:57] drunks and things out there that ought
[27:59] to be a man's job if they put some of
[28:01] these women back in the kitchen where
[28:03] they belong men would have more jobs and
[28:05] there there'd be more of them yeah amen
[28:09] amen you see when you look at these
[28:12] things you realize Deuteronomy
[28:14] 225 it speaks about this uh we think
[28:18] it's just merely speaking about garment
[28:21] it says men should not put on the cloak
[28:24] of a
[28:25] woman It also says women should not
[28:28] put on the attire of men when it speaks
[28:33] of the attire of men it's actually
[28:35] speaking about
[28:38] military it's of course it's in general
[28:40] putting on man's clothes in general but
[28:43] very specifically they were not to be in
[28:46] the military and any country that would
[28:49] put the female forward in the military
[28:54] is a perverted
[28:56] country what kind of man what kind of
[28:58] man when an intruder is coming or
[29:01] there's danger says honey go ahead you
[29:03] you deal with
[29:04] it not a good man not a godly man he
[29:08] knows he's the first one to take the hit
[29:10] and he's going to hide his family behind
[29:13] him to defend and protect them not to
[29:16] put the woman out there so putting a
[29:18] woman on the police force putting a
[29:21] woman out in active duty in the military
[29:25] is a total perversion it should never
[29:27] been allowed in a
[29:30] America God said let every word be a lie
[29:33] and his be true my wife wears dress she
[29:36] picks in the garden she has no trouble
[29:38] about it and anyhow a woman ain't got no
[29:40] business with a bunch of men out there
[29:42] hurting up cattle anyhow she be ought to
[29:44] be in the kitchen where she belongs
[29:46] that's right they're just trying to
[29:50] find God's word is woman that's born of
[29:53] the spirit of God will and a man that's
[29:55] born of the spirit of God won't let his
[29:56] wife act like that
[29:58] what did he say she that cuts her hair
[30:00] dishonors her head and her husband is
[30:02] her head she is
[30:05] dishonorable
[30:07] amen when a woman gets from behind the
[30:10] table in the kitchen in the house taking
[30:12] care of her own little Ministry God gave
[30:15] her her babies she's out of the will of
[30:18] God I don't know how that it can be said
[30:21] more plainly than
[30:24] that all right
[30:30] let me see where I'm at I should
[30:32] consider if I should stop at this
[30:35] place I think I can get through this in
[30:38] five minutes brother brandham says the
[30:40] fifth Vision had to do with the moral
[30:42] problem of our age centering mostly
[30:45] around women God showed me that women
[30:48] began to be out of their place with the
[30:49] granting of the vote so I'm just going
[30:52] to say right now repeal the 19th
[30:56] Amendment that's what we ought to do do
[30:58] am things things in our country would
[31:01] change drastically if that Amendment
[31:03] were repealed all right God showed me
[31:06] that women okay I got that then they cut
[31:09] off their hair which signified that they
[31:11] were no longer under the authority of a
[31:13] man but insisted on either equal rights
[31:15] or in most cases more than equal rights
[31:18] she adopted men's clothing and went into
[31:20] a state of undress until the last
[31:23] picture I saw was a woman naked except
[31:25] for a little fig leaf type apron with
[31:28] this Vision I saw the terrible
[31:30] perversion and moral plight of the whole
[31:33] world and if you remember brother bham
[31:34] also spoke about the fact that this
[31:36] would cause the nation to elect the
[31:40] wrong
[31:41] person and so when when you can really
[31:44] put that together and realize that woman
[31:46] getting the vote it's again it's not a a
[31:50] problem with Holy Ghost filled
[31:54] women the problem is is we understand
[31:56] that in a nation the majority of women
[31:58] aren't going to be holy ghost filled
[32:01] women amen nevertheless
[32:05] nevertheless A Woman's Place is not in
[32:08] politics either either being a
[32:10] politician or voting in politics it's a
[32:14] place for the head of a household yeah
[32:18] and the head of the household should
[32:19] look and he realizes his duty is to
[32:24] protect his
[32:26] wife and his sons and his daughters so
[32:30] when he's voting he takes this all into
[32:33] consideration if he's a if he's a good
[32:35] man he's going to he's going to look at
[32:38] that but what what we have today is when
[32:42] the W woman's vote and if you if you
[32:44] read some of the the literature for
[32:47] those arguing against women's suffrage
[32:49] and I'll do that when I start the next
[32:51] time I just don't have time to do it now
[32:53] is that they realized that what if a
[32:56] woman got the vote it would immediately
[32:57] medely take her out of her position and
[32:59] would insert her into the middle of
[33:02] politics and everything would change she
[33:04] would no longer be in the position that
[33:07] she's supposed to be in the home
[33:10] influencing and raising the children of
[33:12] the family then she would now be subject
[33:16] to every politician coming by and
[33:20] seeking to secure her vote as you see
[33:24] today uh I'm I'm getting into
[33:27] illustrations and into politics you
[33:29] forgive me but I think it's it's
[33:30] applicable to what we're talking about
[33:32] here is even today now you have a
[33:35] Republican party that's moving to the
[33:38] left on abortion and saying oh uh yeah
[33:42] you know early abortion shouldn't be
[33:44] allowed but the rest of it should be
[33:45] allowed and if if even the the the
[33:49] nominee from the party is saying if a
[33:52] abortion ban came to my desk and I was
[33:53] President I would veto that so they why
[33:56] are they doing that it's not because men
[33:58] are asking for that it's not that it's
[34:01] not because they're appealing to the
[34:02] vote of men what are they doing they're
[34:05] appealing to the vote of women because
[34:07] why because every poll tells you that
[34:11] the most important thing for women is to
[34:13] be able to murder their babies as I said
[34:15] before so that is why Republicans are
[34:18] pulling that side but put it repeal the
[34:20] 19th Amendment they're not they're not
[34:22] going to be appealing to Women Voters
[34:25] and trying to say you know you can do do
[34:27] this and you can do that and all these
[34:30] horrible things that are now allowed in
[34:32] our society wearing
[34:34] bikinis uh in public wearing yoga pants
[34:37] in public this all should be illegal and
[34:40] people that do it should be taken to the
[34:42] insane asylum and when you dress in a
[34:45] dress because the world has totally lost
[34:48] its mind to this feminism you you you go
[34:51] out in a dress and dress properly they
[34:53] say look at that uh
[34:56] fanatic and we're looking back at them
[34:58] and look at those insane
[35:00] idiots dressing like they're out of
[35:03] their minds no godly man wants his wife
[35:07] to perade her body out before other men
[35:10] no Godly father wants his daughter to
[35:13] parade her body in front of
[35:16] man it's a total perversion and why do
[35:19] we have this perversion the prophet said
[35:21] it because it started with woman getting
[35:24] the vote it's not a radical thing that
[35:27] brother brandom said we might have
[35:29] thought it was a radical
