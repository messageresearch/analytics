will praise the Lord one more time I will praise the Lord [Music] yes I will praise the Lord no matter what tomorrow brings for what it has in St I will praise the Lord amen no matter what happens right amen let's just turn to our scripture real quick I going to go to Mark chap 10 starting with verse 17 we'll just get right into it I know it's a Wednesday night I don't want to hold you too long I've only got 19 pages so that shouldn't take too long right amen go ahead brother amen Mark 1017 you there just say amen amen Okay and like you said I'm nervous so forgive me and uh my jacket I usually wear out gromy I've shrunk so it's bigger so I can't wear it any longer so just forgive me for that too the Bible says when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness do not defraud honor thy father and thy mother and he answered and said unto him master all these things I observed from my youth then Jesus beholding him and I like this because he he loved him yeah and brother Bram said he must have had something good quality about him that he loved this man yes and he said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me amen and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions Jes Jesus looked around about and sath unto his disciples how heartily shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God I want to skip down to verse 28 then Peter begin to say unto him Lo we have left all and have followed thee let's bow our heads gracious heavenly father as we approach your word this morning this evening there is no man that I know of that's able to handle it only you yes amen amen and Lord if you don't come and speak to us tonight and I've done no good at all but Lord may your spirit come and anoint our hearing and our ears and Lord anoint my lips for without that Lord you know my heart when I was a young man I tried to preach and I was it was terrible but when you come and you speak we see things move yes we see people healed Lord we see people delivered yes and Lord this church here God it's such I feel so humbled around the ministry that he's already got here what a body of Believers Lord bless them I pray anoint me now in Jesus Christ name amen amen you can be seated I also want to turn to 2 Corinthians chapter 4 starting with verse one I do a lot of scripture I hope that's all right therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received Mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the sight of God but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost amen yes now brother Brandon in unveiling of God I'm going to read this quote it's out of paragraph 21 and part of 23 he said I hope and trust that you have a spiritual understanding of what that God had been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out see it's a thing sometimes we have to say things such as a way that it might thin down it might bring some to go out yeah some to leave and some to ponder over but it's done purposely it must be done that way I hope we understand this morning I know most of us here are grown up I hope right so people come in some leave yeah amen then it might be the same would say you mean God would purposely do a thing like that he certainly did amen I'm going to leave it there that's not my message on who's leaving and coming but that's you'll get the Gest of what I'm going to go to here in just a minute minute yeah and the sermon forsaking all [Music] 1962 paragraph 76 I know yall don't know me some going do this usually I don't tell where I'm getting it from but tonight I'm going to my first time here Jesus said on the scripture said he that loves the world or things of the world the love of God is not in him right it takes forsaking all there when you are with willing to forsake all and follow him then see forsaking all the rich man could not give up his riches he could not forsake something and that's the way it is with us a lot of times we forget that forsaking all means getting rid of everything you know I was listening to some uh gospel singers a what few years back and they told me that they or it was on the radio they said that they got their inspiration from country and western music now this is Southern gospel country and western What Spirit was behind that yeah brother it's not a good one right they would not forsake the worldly things amen now John 15:1 says I am the True Vine the father and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now you can cling now ye are cling through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you and the branch cannot be bear fruit except it abide in the vine no one can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing amen now we know who he is right right he's the word John 1:1 if a man abideth not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you now how many believe God's bring us a perfect word in this age amen how many of you here is filled with the Holy Ghost amen some of this isn't for you then amen because you have forsaken all is that right you have forsaken your own thoughts you have forsaken your own ideas you have forsaken everything that the world has come at you with to follow Christ is that right so if we have forsaken everything then we can ask God anything we want within his will and we can have it if we can believe amen I believe God said he would come to us yes and give us all that we have need of he says he not forsake his people is that right right you got a need then ask him for it if you have a need I'm going to say it again ask him for it but then what are you going to do when you ask him for it you've got to Bo believe what does that mean that means forsaking every other thought that would come into your mind that would cause you to doubt [Applause] that oh my you have to forsake it you know we got people I preach for a little while not too long I guess like some of these ministers here but have a little bit but have come across people that want to serve God yeah without forsaking everything amen they're still hanging on to things of the world and then they want to know why or wonder why their life isn't in the position it should be when they have a need amen now don't take what I'm saying wrong we all go through cows and tribulations amen that don't mean you're not doing what God wants but there's too many of us that sometimes we get to that place that we have not forsaken everything to the place God can move through us and when we talk to him and we ask him something he gives it to us amen listen to this John 15:17 says if you abide in me and my words my words abide in you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you if what abides in me his word well who's the word Jesus Christ where did that come from he went to heaven he's sitting on the right hand of God what is it that life that was in him as the spirit of God came back down on the day of Pentecost is now is in you amen then if that is in you the word is in you you cannot deny one thing that the Bible says or the prophet said that when God sent a prophet to very ver ify that word to us is that right now if you have doubts you need to get on your knees and find out where the doubts are coming from or you need to do what the Bible says and cast those things down and leave them there by the side of the road hearing my father is glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples going back into forsaking all again in 62 brother brand if you've not listened to the sermon for a while you need to go back and listen to it it's just phenomenal sermon I think amen if he says if you abide in me my words in you you can ask what you will and it will be done for you but you cannot knowing that those things are wrong you know they're wrong so if you're doing something you know is wrong you can't ask now let me give you just a few things he says is wrong the Bible is against them card playing cigarette smoking drinking wearing inmoral clothes and then claiming to be a Christian if that spirit in you does not condemn that then there is something wrong with that with the spirit that's in you good well that means there's a different spirit because the word of God wrote the word God who wrote the word is the word the word is in you and it condemns you it's got to and if it doesn't you are being deceived now let me ask you something I don't want no one to raise their hands here how many of us have ever done things we know we shouldn't have done and paid for it I'm going to raise my hand cuz I know I have amen amen like I said I'm not asking you to raise your hands but I have you pay for it because God will discipline you if you're his child is that right he says he disciplines every one of his children that comes to him and if you're not being disciplined by God you're none of his that's right amen well I enjoy the discipline amen I enjoy it more if I don't need the discipline amen now you can he says you're being deceived how can the Holy Spirit write something and you turn around and do contrary to it and the Holy Spirit is leading you you can't do it see you can't you can't say rock and roll of the world or is of god rock and roll is of the world Amen now I want to stop there just for a minute cuz all you people that's listening to the message brother brandom didn't say rock and roll lyrics right brother he said rock and roll music and I notied that some so-called gospel music has went rock and roll amen there's a spirit behind it yeah am some of us enjoy the spirit that's behind some of the music I'm just being honest here if your pastor thinks I'm wrong he can correct it then I'll take it but it's the truth anyway as far as I know rock and roll is wrong just like country and western true you got such an anointed song leaders around here that come up here and leaden that's what you need you want to dance to something there's something to dance to God will give you a Spirit of Dance listen to this real see you can't you can't say rock and roll is of god rock and roll is of the world any of those dances and filtered nasty filthy things rather is out of the world it's all of the world you can't say bobbed hair for women is of God the Bible says it isn't so it's the filth of the world if you love The One Speck of the world the love of God is not even in you can I say something else I hope I don't hurt no one's feelings I believe we're all all right here we're grown a little bit but you also can't connect yourself to an unbeliever in marriage amen come on if you're flirting around with worldly women or men or boys or girls or whoever you are you are going into a very dangerous area that's going to cause you such a harm spiritually and you better be careful even if they claim to be a Christian because I know a lady girl I know several people that married so-called Christian boys they found out that they weren't so Christian and they end up single by themselves raising children prayer what what am I trying to say c cast down all reasoning cast down anything that's contrary to the word of God and lift yourself up into his word look at who he is like I said I hope I don't hurt no one's feelings [Music] but I've skipped a lot already but I know we got to he said what's that well that's drawing it it's drawing something down on the inside drawing I like what brother Brown puts this the soul is drawing your resource through the outside down through the spirit into the soul and if the soul loves the world it's deaden so I like to check myself every so often what is my spirit drawing on is it drawing on the world that's good is it drawing on movies more than it is the word of God is it drawing on the worldly things and the things out there that we shouldn't be drawing on oh my you know I like what your pastor said just the other Sunday I believe it was the other Sunday it was one of the Sundays anyway how many times are you reading your Bible you know I I people say oh I read my Bible every day you find out they read one verse that's not enough right or how how often have you prayed this week oh we pray every day when we go to bed for five minutes if they get lucky for five and then they want to know why their spiritual life is dead they're drawing on the RO wrong things they're not talking to the God right they're not listening to what God has to say to them you know why they're not listening they can't hear him any longer forsaking all he says if the soul loves the world it's dead I don't care how it's anointed anointed ones at the end time just go back and listen to that and if you don't what he's talking about here my father was one of those very anointed man behind the pull pit seeing people healed curse you out after church so I know what I'm talking but I live through it and and it confused me as a kid amen and I went into the world because of and I told God I don't know what's right and wrong so I'm till you can show me I'm I'm leaving and did for a long time God kept drawing on me and I kept pushing him away he kept drawing I kept pushing him away but he made a liar out of me because he didn't show me what was right until after I got saved and then he led me to that sermon anointed ones at the end time God make you a liar you think you can do whatever you want to God will make you a liar amen amen actually you're making yourself one but you know what I mean listen to this I said I hope I hope this ain't too harsh he said it's drawing on something it's something down on the inside drawing the soul is drawing your resource through the outside through down through the spirit into the soul and if that soul loves the world it's dead I don't care how it's anointed amen now that's for ministers and I've seen ministers that way but that's not just for ministers that's for Lay people musicians song leaders it's for all of us he's talking to everyone here not just a certain group right so we need to check what we're drawing on I'm talking about myself I have to check what I'm drawing on I don't care how it's anointed it is out here and how religious or righteous it is out here don't care how righteous it looks down in here it's dead for he that loves the world or the things of the world the love of God is not even in him no matter how religious right he says the true filter that way will set all those things out and bring nothing but tress of God the word into the real true Soul if you want to know what he's talking about filters there most of us probably listen to it thank you man's filter go listen to it it's very good sermon then how do we get into the real word of God how do we get it let's just go to 1 Corinthians 1213 you ministers know where I'm going for by one Spirit you are all baptized into one body whether you be jew or Gentile whether you be Bond or free and have all been made to drink into one one one Spirit not two Spirits not a worldly spirit in his can't serve two masters one Spirit whether you be Bond or free or have all been made to drink into one Spirit First Corinthians 10 or 2 Corinthians 10:1 now Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who in the presence am among based among you but being absent and bold toward you I like that because it makes it sound like he's talking to me he's absent from me but here he is Paul's talking to me tonight but I beseech you that I may not be bold when I am present with you that confidence wherewith I think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh is that right right for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to pulling down of strongholds now this is a huge key here he's going to tell you how to pull them down you young people need to listen to this casting down imaginations so do you older people yeah and I'm talking about myself too and every High thing yeah not just the low things every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ amen what's Christ the anointing what's the anointing the spirit of God bringing all things into C captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled now I wanted to look at a couple of words here in verse six it says Revenge I looked it up in the Greek to vindicate one's right do one Justice to protect defend having in all read in Readiness to Revenge all what Disobedience listen to what that word means a hearing a misso casting down all imaginations the hearing a Miss how many times have we listened to ministers you know because I I stream some every once in a while I'm talking about nominal ones because some of them's got some good thoughts I I I listen to there's a few I'm listen to once in a while but if you listen close you hear a Miss what do I do with that I cast it down amen amen amen sure brother casting down anything but look look I like the way he says it here and having in a Readiness to Revenge amen revenge is hard I mean we're talking about to do one's Justice to avenge a thing to punish how do you punish in a Miss because you cast it down you stomp on it you get rid of it what about healing you know we've talked about healing here at the church before and I know your pastor done a lot better job than I'm going to do tonight on it but healing how do you get healed amen well by everyone says Oh by faith faith does it it that's true and I'm not making light of that fa but what's Faith what's believing what's believing casting down anything that's contrary to it am brother brandom says in in the let me go back over here like I said I skipped quite a bit but then the unveiling of God I believe it was the sermon go listen to it he says to look to get what you need he says you got to do something he says he's talking about when he had to throw the stone up in the air and it started a whirlwind well here there's another sermon I can't remember which one it is you brothers that are ministers and read the sermons you'll know what I'm talking about but also said that in one of the prayer lines he had he had Tommy Osman come up in a prayer help him pray and he says Tommy Tommy asked said may I may I say something he says sure brother so Tommy gets up behind the mic and he goes brother and he says now when you come up to get prayed for he says if you've got a you know something wrong with you start using it if you got a bad hand or an arm you know start moving it amen don't just get prayed for and walk away like this you've got to do something you've got to exercise your faith amen You Know Jack Co I know a lot of people may not have liked him very much but brother Brown said he was a good man you know I I I've watched several his videos there's a woman that had a cancer on her face you can still see it he goes up and he takes this and he starts doing this comes off in his hand he did something there was a man who was crippled over bent over like this he goes over there behind him grabs him puts his knee in his back now I don't recommend us doing this don't take what I'm saying wrong God's leading this man to do it or it wouldn't have done and he puts his knee in his bang starts straightening him up and bending him over straightening him up bending him over straighten him up the guy out the straight of board my point behind that is if Jack didn't do it for him he should have done it himself you start doing what God tells you to do because by faith you're starting to believe that the word of God said do it then he said I by his stripes ye were healed not that you're going to be healed it's not a futuristic thing but you're healed right now thank you and I'm just going to be real blunt cuz brother your pastor already knows I had two shots in my back yesterday because I got a real bad back but I don't let it stop me cuz the doctors told me years ago I should be in a wheelchair and I refuse the go set amen and I've told the people that I Pastor for all those years if I get in the wheelchair God's going to bring me out of it it's where you're going to put your faith are you going to put it in you know we got a precious brother in Virginia's fighting cancer amen he hasn't stopped there ain't no one of us should feel sorry for ourselves listening to that testimony I love that brother he come and spoke for us one time in Illinois precious brother love brother Spencer may not know this but even got brother from Tennessee to come and speak for us once answered a lot of questions for us forsaking all and those Brothers come with nothing because we had nothing they paid their own way and came we were such a small church I mean we give them something but it wasn't near enough God to bless him for that in eternity forsaking all let's get back to this I'm sorry there when you are willing to forsake all and follow him then if ye abide in me and my word abides in you whatever you ask shall be done Mark 16:14 and I'm going to close it out with this here but I want you to listen carefully afterwards he appeared into the 11 as they sat at meat and up braided them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they belied not them which had seen him after he was risen that's very important because some of us went in brother bram's meetings none of us was back here during Jesus's walk on earth but some of us believed many more does not he up braided them because they would not believe what the others had seen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name name I ain't pointing to myself here Christ in me in my name Jesus Christ in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpant a lot of us got rid of the tongue talking I ain't talking about your church here but they preach against it it is because Bible tells us Paul taught us that in the pr of our Clos that is an intercession for us and him amen amen it will intercede for you that spirit of God will intercede if you'll let it flow he'll intercede for us I woke up in the middle of the night one night hearing myself speaking to something I didn't know what I was talking something was interceding for me think of that thank you Jesus but we've gotten rid of that stuff not here I know that church world has practically they shall speak to with Tong they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken to them he received up into heaven and sit on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached every everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following musicians you can come forward I've got many more pages here but I'm not going to get to it tonight because it's going to it'd be another hour and a half probably so I I put a little note here says stop I know that most of you know this and I'm not preaching to you that know it this is a reminder amen I'm not trying to PE preach you into something you didn't know I'm giving you a reminder cast down and you have to do this every single day of your life Satan's not going to stop just because you cast it down today tomorrow you're going to have to cast it down again whatever thought comes to you that is not of the word of God H cast it down and get rid of it put it aside oh my brother amen Give the Lord a hand clap of [Applause] Praise amen that's all stand did you appreciate the word of the Lord amen what a u such a simple thought to say forsaking all but you know I believe that that in this age that we live in today it's it's more and more important that every day we say Lord I'm going to forsake everything I think brother brandom in that message forsaken all one of my favorite uh quotes in there brother brandom talks about you might have read it Brother David or something close to it but he talks about how that we want to he said so many times we want to follow Jesus and hold on to everything at the same time and he says you know sometimes the Lord wants you to follow him and let go of let go of everything and he says because sometimes times you got to put both hands on him and you can't put both hands on him until you let go of everything and say Lord I'm going to let it all go so I can hold on to you amen you need a promise tonight let go of everything and grab a hold with both hands amen amen wow my goodness Brother David If You Preach like that and my goodness you preached it's only 8:15 they're going to be

understand what was going on I just knew something was wrong I was very nauseous all the time I couldn't even ride in a car even 20 miles I would get so car sick I mean Jason and Debbie would have to give me nausea medicine to even go to my sister's funeral well I talked to Meredith with thought my blood pressure medicine I cut it in half the doctor approved uh we couldn't figure out what was wrong So eventually I just decided to come up for prayer and Jason called all the ministers up I told Jason I just need prayer for my body I don't know what's wrong with it and that's been about a year or so ago so then um I called sister Deborah and I said or I think I called Matthew I said uh would you like me to help with a Christmas little children's program she does I'll tell the the birth in the manger story on Christmas Eve that was Sunday well y'all mostly know I love to tell stories stories I don't get nervous telling stories I love doing it especially Bible stories well but I'm a type of person I got to know where I'm going and what I'm doing before I do it and I kept asking Matthew okay Matthew how do I what do you want me to do out there on the steps that Sunday morning Matthew come up he didn't know why he did it put his arm around me and started praying for me for my nerves I thought well okay Matthew I'm not nervous but something was going on in my body when I come out here and most of y'all were here and I told that Christmas story of the birth of Christ there was something going on in my body I couldn't explain it it was like an anxiety bubbling bubbling bubbling and as soon as I left and went out of the platform my chest hurt the rest of the day that wasn't unusual I've had it before and it usually I pray and it goes away that was on Sunday Monday we had Christmas Tuesday I'm wiped out cuz I went over to Jason and Debbie's the family I'm wiped out and I think well it's just I've got a lot going on so I'll get up in the morning and I'll feel better after a good night's rest I got up in the morning on Wednesday morning and fullblown own heart attacks and I called Jason we went to the walk-in clinic they sent me to the ER and he called brother Andrew and brother Andrew had already left the hospital so he called one of his doctor friends told him to take care of me and he did I wound up I had two stance put in my heart I had a 90 blockage and a 80 blockage which they said was a Widow Maker or or Widow wor maker and you know the doctor come in to me that day cuz they kept me overnight and I told him about Sunday about that going on and this is Wednesday he said yeah this is Wednesday now God spared my life for another year for some reason and I think it's all y'all's prayers and I definitely think it's Matthew's prayer and the church's prayers and for whatever reason I'm still here and the doctor said yeah and this is Wednesday I should have died and that would have been okay I mean 83 years old it's okay but I just but I just wanted I just wanted to thank all y'all and let you know how God so intervened and I know when Jason sent out the notice sister Jean in the hospital y'all was probably all praying so hey it got
