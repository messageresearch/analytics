[37:15] God's going to choose for his army the
[37:17] best weapon that could be given and he
[37:21] chose it and it was his word God gave
[37:25] his army the best equipment that it
[37:27] could could ever
[37:29] use and ever could use and would never
[37:32] have to be changed he's never changed it
[37:36] since you don't improve it it Remains
[37:40] the Same it's God's words that he
[37:42] fortified his people with no matter how
[37:45] many things Satan gets and Satan is
[37:48] constantly getting things he's got more
[37:50] things today than he had when I was a
[37:52] young person he's got these things
[37:55] now when before you had to go sneak
[37:59] somewhere but now you should stay home
[38:01] where nobody can see you Satan has a lot
[38:04] of
[38:05] devices if I want to you know sneak
[38:08] around we did have headphones we had our
[38:11] little walkman's we had our little
[38:12] cassette tapes when you go somewhere you
[38:14] got whole case of C tapes you're
[38:16] carrying with you that we used to listen
[38:18] to what are you listening to a good
[38:24] music
[38:26] hello test test one
[38:31] two we'll move on how many things any
[38:34] other Army gets or anything it can never
[38:37] take the place of God's
[38:40] choice his word he gave them his word
[38:43] his promise and said stay with
[38:46] it that's the best he could be known so
[38:50] we're to put on the whole
[38:51] armor this armor is the Holy Ghost we're
[38:55] not to go armed partly
[38:57] we just can't have the Holy Ghost on our
[38:59] spirit expect to make it in we've got to
[39:01] get the Holy Ghost down inside of our
[39:05] soul you know in in a country in a real
[39:08] war a country don't send a soldiers out
[39:10] with no
[39:12] weapons okay you're going to go fight
[39:14] but we're not gonna give you anything to
[39:15] fight with God's not going to put you in
[39:18] this battle and not give you something
[39:20] to fight
[39:23] with he's prepared his best for you he's
[39:27] not going to send you out with something
[39:29] that's not going to help
[39:30] you he's not going to send you some more
[39:33] Baptist
[39:34] Doctrine or even some message Doctrine
[39:37] he's going to send you out with his word
[39:40] he's going to send you out with
[39:41] something you can actually fight
[39:44] with a person needs all the armor to
[39:47] fight the battle of the Lord and if he
[39:50] lacks one of these weapons that God has
[39:52] appointed you are
[39:54] defeated we have armor protecting every
[39:57] every part I like the way Paul says
[40:00] every part except our back he didn't put
[40:03] nothing on our back because we're not
[40:06] supposed to be facing no devil we're
[40:08] supposed to be looking right at him like
[40:09] here we're not supposed to be running
[40:10] from him don't turn your back on no
[40:13] devil because he he'll stab
[40:18] you it's to show that the Christian
[40:21] should never quit but always face the
[40:24] enemy I me we always there's times we
[40:27] y'all feel like just
[40:29] quitting am I the only one sometimes you
[40:33] feel like I'm I'm just I'm
[40:37] done hallelujah you're quiet
[40:41] why we're always to face the enemy
[40:44] there's no cowards in God's
[40:46] Army we're not to be running from the
[40:49] devil we got to run at the
[40:53] Devil don't let him get the surprise
[40:55] tack you do it
[40:57] he likes to surprise
[40:59] you put on the whole armor of God that
[41:02] you may be able to stand against the Ws
[41:04] of the
[41:06] devil the word WS means that is traced
[41:09] out method that which is well laid out
[41:13] skill
[41:15] cunning the devil's skillful he's
[41:18] cunning he knows you better than you
[41:20] know
[41:25] yourself WS of the devil trying to same
[41:29] do the same thing he did to
[41:31] Eve surely God has
[41:34] said he added one word to it the same
[41:39] tactic he used in the Garden of Eden he
[41:41] tries to use
[41:43] today but he's looking at a second Eve
[41:46] that won't
[41:47] fall that won't fall to his cunning
[41:51] lies Satan doesn't carry on an open
[41:54] Warfare he's not going to confront you
[41:56] face to face the face but he likes to
[41:58] sneak around you know you heard of
[42:00] gorilla
[42:01] Warfare he likes to sneak around the
[42:03] bushes where you can't see him and look
[42:05] around the corner at
[42:06] you attack you when you're not ready
[42:10] attack you when you're at the weakest
[42:11] moment attack you when you're at in bed
[42:13] at night all the lights are off and
[42:15] you're on your
[42:18] phone what you looking
[42:21] at Mama's not here daddy's not around
[42:27] woo
[42:29] hallelujah it's necessary to be
[42:32] constantly armed to meet him you got to
[42:36] be ready whenever the tack is made
[42:38] you'll say well I'm not fighting
[42:40] anything today praise
[42:43] God but be
[42:46] ready Monday's
[42:49] coming that'll be a sermon you can
[42:51] preach one time Monday's coming
[43:01] a man who has to contend with a visible
[43:03] enemy may feel
[43:07] safe if he only prepares him to meet him
[43:09] in the open
[43:10] field but it's different if the enemy is
[43:15] invisible he'll still Among Us like I
[43:18] said he'll sneak around in the
[43:22] bushes what a foe we have a great foe
[43:28] that we're fighting against and almost
[43:30] all of the Christian struggle is a
[43:33] Warfare against his strategies and WS he
[43:36] plans
[43:38] everything he said I'm going to get you
[43:42] when you least expect it I'm going to
[43:43] get you so we always got to be watching
[43:46] and
[43:48] waiting he likes to get you in your
[43:51] mind when suddenly you come across this
[43:54] old
[43:56] website brother Brown was a false
[43:58] prophet there's things that he said was
[44:02] wrong he likes to mess with your mind

[44:07] right what if brother Bram was a false
[44:09] prophet what what what what if what if

[44:15] ones who ain't got the Holy Ghost he
[44:17] likes to tell them stuff in their minds
[44:19] these people are
[44:23] crazy he'll invite you to Pleasures that
[44:26] seems to be
[44:27] harmless and lead you into indulge in
[44:30] sin until we have gone so far that we
[44:33] cannot
[44:34] Retreat he has offered everything to
[44:38] you he's promised you a life full of joy
[44:41] no more fighting no more you you'll just
[44:44] be free I've known people who left this
[44:46] message says I am so free of course you
[44:50] are the devil ain't fighting you no more
[44:59] Hallelujah don't give
[45:02] in don't give up keep
[45:07] fighting don't give in to the young to
[45:09] the to the devil young
[45:11] people you are GNA take our places one
[45:14] day some one of you might be a pastor
[45:17] here one of you might be a song
[45:19] leader one of's about to be a Sunday
[45:21] school teacher whatever you may be but
[45:24] don't give in the devil stand against
[45:27] those that try to corrupt
[45:29] you you've been taught cuz the of
[45:32] child the way they should go they should
[45:34] never depart so if you're taught right
[45:36] there's
[45:38] hope you know just like the devil tried
[45:41] the first church he had them
[45:44] killed he I'll shut him
[45:46] up didn't work did it he thought it did
[45:49] because then then all a sudden through
[45:51] the Dark Ages you look it looked very
[45:53] Bleak and then here come a man said the
[45:56] just shall live by Faith here comes the
[45:58] Army starting to build back
[46:01] up for we wrestle not against flesh in
[46:05] blood that word wrestle means you know
[46:07] what wrestle
[46:09] is a contest between two in which each
[46:12] Endeavor to throw the other which is
[46:16] decided when the Victor is able to hold
[46:18] his opponent down with his hand on his
[46:23] neck you see wrestling that fake stuff
[46:27] you seen some real stuff too what they
[46:29] try to do they try to pin you down so
[46:32] they'll pin you down I say I think it's
[46:34] three seconds so hold your shoulders and
[46:36] neck down for three seconds you're the
[46:38] Victor we're in a battle we've got to
[46:42] wrestle with the
[46:44] devil I'm not going to pull up brother
[46:46] Aaron up here and wrestle
[46:49] him there's no
[46:52] way so brother Aaron we're not wrestling
[46:55] against flesh and blood
[47:02] like I said when you're wrestling the go
[47:03] is to pin your opponent to the ground
[47:06] you have to get the opponent on the
[47:08] ground you just can't grab his leg I won
[47:12] no he's still
[47:17] free no you got to put his neck on the
[47:19] ground you got to hold him down you get
[47:23] the point and the referee counts one two
[47:26] three
[47:28] Victor but in this battle you pin one
[47:32] devil down you might have you might be
[47:34] fighting with Lion demon your whole life
[47:37] all of a sudden you have victory over
[47:38] him and you put him down you're like
[47:41] thank the
[47:43] Lord I overcome that
[47:45] devil I'm free then a gossip demon pops
[47:49] on
[47:51] you demon after demon after de you you
[47:55] you think you're winning but here comes
[47:57] another one so we got 200,000 after so
[48:00] let's keep pinning the devil down let's
[48:01] hold him
[48:03] down they'll not be not one devil
[48:07] conquered sorry about that every devil
[48:10] will be conquered when we lead this
[48:11] world even death we'll have death pinned
[48:15] under us only thing death is is
[48:17] something to get us out of
[48:21] here but how are we going to win this
[48:24] match we've got to it's not
[48:27] power it won't be by our power brother
[48:30] Mark I can't do this on my own there's
[48:32] no way that I Brad Ys can beat the
[48:37] devil I've got to have a hidden power
[48:39] from down on the inside of me a h just
[48:42] like Samson had Samson had a hidden
[48:46] power when they had him all chained up
[48:48] and him sitting right here making fun of
[48:50] him he looks over and sees a jaw onone
[48:53] he grabs it and slays a thousand
[48:55] Philistines a hidden Power Burst forth
[48:57] out of him a hidden power come out of
[48:59] shamgar one day when 600 Philistines
[49:03] come after him he got tired of the devil
[49:05] stealing his Joy he got tired of the de
[49:08] devil stealing his Peace So what he do a
[49:11] hidden power from on the inside of
[49:17] him you've got the same hidden power
[49:20] inside of
[49:21] you
[49:23] if you got the Holy Ghost you've got the
[49:26] same hidden power of God that could
[49:29] overcome every devil same power David
[49:33] had when he killed Goliath the same
[49:37] power Jesus had when he died and Rose up
[49:39] on the out of the Grave on the third day
[49:41] that same hidden powers in you so what
[49:45] devil can stand in front of
[49:48] you not
[49:53] one wherefore take unto you the whole
[49:56] armor of God that you may be able to
[49:58] withstand to stand
[50:01] against stand therefore having your
[50:04] loins G about he's going to give us some
[50:05] stuff to put on you got to have your
[50:07] breastplate then you got to have your
[50:09] feet shot with the preparation of the
[50:10] pieace and I probably said this here
[50:12] before the Roman
[50:14] soldiers their shoes had spikes on them
[50:18] so when they
[50:19] marched they had firm foundation so
[50:23] wherever they marched their feet was
[50:24] sticken
[50:26] you have spikes on you today spiritual
[50:30] spikes on your
[50:32] feet not only do you have the devil Pinn
[50:34] down by your by your hand you've got him
[50:36] by your feet you're marching you're
[50:39] walking on the devil so wherever your
[50:42] foot goes that's where the devil
[50:45] is just
[50:48] dragging what's got you what's bothering
[50:51] you this morning put it under your feet
[50:54] and drag him around don't lift him up
[50:58] so if the devil's not there he's out of
[51:00] his
[51:04] place but you got to remember that the
[51:07] devil has no Authority outside of that
[51:10] which God has given
[51:13] him he knows he has a short rain so he's
[51:16] on a rampage he's seeking whom he may
[51:21] devour he knows he has a short Reign you
[51:24] know the devil's like a dog behind a
[51:26] fence
[51:27] all he can do is just
[51:29] bark long as he behind the
[51:33] fence you're safe as long as you stay
[51:36] away from that fence but once you open
[51:38] the door and let the devil in that dog
[51:41] will eat you
[51:48] up leave the devil on the other side of
[51:50] the
[51:52] fence watch him he'll try to draw you
[51:55] into his trap
[52:00] it's like I think I think I did tell
[52:01] this here before about this dog behind a
[52:04] fence I went by a fence one day that had
[52:07] a dog behind
[52:08] it gate was closed I just kick that
[52:10] fence just RW that dog up make him
[52:14] mad so he was that dog ever gets me I'm
[52:18] I'm
[52:19] hurting but I come by that fence one day
[52:22] and didn't know that the gate was open
[52:30] I got out there just in
[52:33] time he tells you that the pleasures of
[52:36] sin is so much
[52:40] fun tells you that you don't have to
[52:42] live this
[52:44] word you can listen to what you want to
[52:47] it's got the name Jesus in the
[52:50] song yeah but you're going down the road
[52:54] headbanging all right
[52:59] amen he uses anything and everything
[53:03] that he can do to bring us
[53:05] down above all take the shield of Faith
[53:09] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[53:11] all the fiery darts not just some of
[53:14] them not all of
[53:17] them all the fiery darts of the wicked
[53:21] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[53:23] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[53:25] God pray in
[53:28] always our greatest weapon is prayer
[53:32] prayer changes things the word of God
[53:35] will I love this saying the word of God
[53:38] will defeat the Devil
[53:41] anytime any place anywhere under any
[53:47] circumstance but the only
[53:50] way you've got to get the Holy Ghost you
[53:54] got to get the full armor of God
[53:58] cuz when the weakest Christian gets on
[54:00] their knees to pray Satan
[54:07] trembles you have to be watching
[54:10] constantly guarding ourselves watching
[54:13] and studying the
[54:16] devil you've got to study him CU he sure
[54:19] studies
[54:20] you he knows a lot about you but you got
[54:24] to understand his ws and what he's going
[54:26] to throw at you because he's got that
[54:28] one punch at you and he knows what each
[54:32] one of us what punch we
[54:42] got all right I know what I'm doing we
[54:45] have to be equipped with the same armor
[54:49] that the apostles
[54:52] had the Holy
[54:54] Ghost but before you take it put this
[54:56] Armor All You must see your need of it
[54:59] and that you are in a battle you got to
[55:02] recognize you're in a
[55:05] battle and you got to recognize that he
[55:07] is mightier than we
[55:09] are talk about the Devil he's mightier
[55:12] than we
[55:14] are by ourselves not talk about God with
[55:18] us we are no match for him unless we put
[55:22] on that whole armor of God and place our
[55:26] trust trust Into His holy
[55:29] name he's not going to fight
[55:32] fair he won't give you even break he's a
[55:35] liar he's a
[55:38] deceiver he'll come with you at all
[55:40] kinds of different
[55:42] disguises he'll come at disguise as a
[55:46] brother or a
[55:50] sister want to cause trouble you watch
[55:54] out you watch out
[55:58] out he'll come to you in many different
[56:00] disguises titing you to disobey the
[56:03] Lord and he's a lot smarter than you
[56:06] are there's a reason why Saints should
[56:09] be strong in the Lord and why they
[56:11] should put on the whole armor of God and
[56:14] prepare for
[56:16] battle since our enemies are described
[56:18] as not flesh and
[56:22] blood for we wrestle not against flesh
[56:25] our enemy isn't each other it's the
[56:29] devil when a brother and sister does
[56:31] something to you it's not that brother
[56:33] and sister it's the
[56:35] devil we don't need to add our brother
[56:37] and sisters to the fight we need our
[56:40] brother and sisters to help us
[56:44] fight 1 Corinthians 9:25 says every man
[56:47] that striveth for Mastery is temperate
[56:50] in all
[56:51] things now they do it to tame the
[56:54] corruptible Crown but we and Inc
[56:56] corruptible so Paul said I therefore so
[57:00] run not as
[57:02] uncertainty he said I'm run a race and I
[57:05] know I'm going to
[57:06] win so fight fight I not as one who
[57:11] beateth the
[57:12] air you know you're growing up you
[57:14] pretend like you're in a boxing match
[57:17] you know you all going around all the
[57:18] time and just kind of boxing you're not
[57:20] hit nobody you're Shadow
[57:22] Boxing Paul says I'm not Shadow Boxing
[57:25] cuz when whenever I swing my hands I'm
[57:27] hitting
[57:31] something he says I
[57:35] fight not has one beaten the
[57:39] air so he's making contact with whoever
[57:41] he's punching but I keep under my
[57:46] body when I see I got this definition
[57:49] last night keep
[57:51] under it means to beat Black and Blue
[57:59] to Smite to craw to cause bruises it's
[58:03] like a boxer when they're punching at
[58:06] you they're always aiming at your face
[58:07] they're punching right here because this
[58:09] right here is easy to turn black and
[58:12] blue to beat one out to wear one
[58:16] out so I beat my body black and
[58:23] blue to bring it unto
[58:27] subjection so I'm going to beat my body
[58:31] into a subjection black and blue
[58:33] subjection means I'm going to enslave it
[58:36] so my body is going to do what I tell it
[58:39] to if it don't I'm going to beat it
[58:42] black and
[58:43] blue you're going to get up and go to
[58:45] church this
[58:47] morning you're going to Worship the Lord
[58:49] this morning when a song leader says
[58:51] raise your hands and worship God I'm
[58:53] going to raise my hand you're going to
[58:55] do it
[58:57] if you don't you're going to
[58:59] pay because I'm going to beat you black
[59:01] and
[59:05] blue but I keep under my
[59:10] body and bring it into subjection lest
[59:13] by any
[59:14] means when I have preached to others
[59:17] myself may be a cast
[59:22] away subjection that's the only time
[59:24] this word is even used in the Bible
[59:28] bringing this body under subjection it's
[59:30] going to do what I
[59:33] said that's
[59:35] overcoming when from the inside of you
[59:39] you control what happens right
[59:42] here to overcome but you got to know who
[59:45] you're fighting against first Peter says
[59:48] be sober and be vigilant because your
[59:50] adversary your
[59:51] brother your adversary your sister your
[59:55] adversary your husband or wife but know
[59:57] your adversary the
[59:59] devil walketh about seeking whom he may
[1:00:03] devour he's not our
[1:00:06] friend he's our
[1:00:11] enemy and I love this quote I read it a
[1:00:15] lot I think brother Caleb might have
[1:00:17] read it some not too long ago
[1:00:20] overcome means to recognize the devil in
[1:00:25] every one one of his tricks you know a
[1:00:28] lot of people say there's no devil it's
[1:00:30] just a thought don't you believe that
[1:00:33] there's a real devil and he's just as
[1:00:36] real as you are or
[1:00:39] anybody a real devil and you must
[1:00:43] recognize him real you must know he is a
[1:00:47] devil then the same time that you
[1:00:51] recognize
[1:00:52] him and know that he's a devil
[1:00:56] and he's against you then to overcome
[1:00:59] you must recognize that the god in you
[1:01:03] is greater and mightier than he
[1:01:08] is that the one that you have in you has
[1:01:13] already overcame
[1:01:15] him and by his grace you are more than a
[1:01:20] match for him that's real overcoming
[1:01:24] when you recognize
[1:01:27] but by ourselves we can't do it we must
[1:01:30] have someone greater down on the
[1:01:34] inside not only is God here this morning
[1:01:38] but the devil's here too the devil's the
[1:01:41] most faithful member in this
[1:01:46] church he always feels like coming to
[1:01:49] church cuz he knows what he's going to
[1:01:51] do he comes more than we do
[1:02:01] hello have we ever seen
[1:02:04] God have you ever seen the effects of
[1:02:07] him though we feel his effects we feel
[1:02:10] him when he comes down to a service when
[1:02:12] his anointing is here you can feel the
[1:02:14] presence of almighty God you can feel
[1:02:16] that Joy you can feel that
[1:02:18] peace but y'all can feel the effects of
[1:02:20] the
[1:02:21] devil tries to bring you drown tries to
[1:02:23] get you trying to get you addicted to
[1:02:26] the things of the
[1:02:29] world we'll go ahead and tell him today
[1:02:31] brother Mark I'm
[1:02:33] addicted I got addiction I'm GNA confess
[1:02:35] it to you I'm addicted to
[1:02:37] church I'm addicted to God I'm Addicted
[1:02:41] To His holy ghost I'm addicted to his
[1:02:43] Joy I'm addicted to his
[1:02:47] peace this is the kind of addiction your
[1:02:49] pastor can approve
[1:02:52] of but we're in a battle
[1:02:56] to know your enemy we must know who it
[1:02:58] is we fight
[1:03:00] against you know Satan has fought
[1:03:02] against God his people since the
[1:03:04] beginning of
[1:03:07] time you know Satan before his name was
[1:03:10] Satan he was
[1:03:11] Lucifer and he was a great cheram up in
[1:03:14] heaven a cherubim guarded a
[1:03:17] throne cherubim guarded The Mercy Seat
[1:03:20] he protected the throne and you couldn't
[1:03:22] approach the throne without coming
[1:03:23] through
[1:03:24] Lucifer that's what kind of a being he
[1:03:28] was was Ezekiel 28 says Thou Hast been
[1:03:32] in Eden the Garden of God every precious
[1:03:35] stone was thy covering and he says the
[1:03:38] workmanship of thy tabs and thy pipes
[1:03:40] were prepared in thee the day thou was
[1:03:46] created Created so anything created has
[1:03:50] an
[1:03:53] end we weren't created
[1:03:56] we go way back before the devil
[1:04:01] does we go back before there even was a
[1:04:04] star we were in the back parts of God's
[1:04:07] mind before he even started this thing
[1:04:09] so we always were with God cuz we got
[1:04:12] the eternal life in US eternal life is
[1:04:14] God's life living through you Zoe we
[1:04:17] always were
[1:04:20] Eternal so this right here Luther was
[1:04:22] putting in charge of the music in heaven
[1:04:26] he says Thou Art the anointed cherub
[1:04:28] that coverest I have set thee so thou
[1:04:32] was upon the holy mountain of God thou
[1:04:36] Hast walked up and down in the midst of
[1:04:39] the stones of
[1:04:41] fire how can somebody do that and turn
[1:04:45] out the way he
[1:04:47] was thou was perfect in the way in thy
[1:04:51] ways from the day thou was created
[1:04:55] until iniquity was found in
[1:04:59] you Isaiah 14:12 I know this is very
[1:05:02] familiar how art thou fallen from Heaven
[1:05:05] oh Lucifer son of the morning Lucifer
[1:05:09] the lightbearer The Shining one if you
[1:05:13] look this is the only time this Lucifer
[1:05:16] was mentioned in the
[1:05:18] bible Lucifer had a name
[1:05:20] change so you find him on later on he's
[1:05:23] called Satan the Devil the Dragon the
[1:05:26] old serpent he lost his identification
[1:05:28] in
[1:05:32] heaven we also had us a name
[1:05:35] change we've been we was one day called
[1:05:37] Miss Baptist Miss Catholic Miss
[1:05:42] message one day we got married to Jesus
[1:05:44] Christ we had us a name change B said
[1:05:47] did you know Satan was co-equal with
[1:05:50] God sure was all but a Creator he was
[1:05:54] everything he stood the right hand of
[1:05:56] God in the heavens the great leading
[1:06:00] cherubim Satan was the original
[1:06:03] Archangel of God he once dwelt in heaven
[1:06:07] he once was the greatest person in
[1:06:10] heaven outside of
[1:06:13] God he was God's right-hand man to
[1:06:17] Fellowship but what happened he got
[1:06:20] puffed up in his heart he wanted to
[1:06:23] build a United Kingdom a greater
[1:06:26] Splendor and seemly more cultured a
[1:06:30] greater Kingdom than Michael Christ
[1:06:33] had so he could do anything but
[1:06:38] create but he know he wanted something
[1:06:41] more he didn't like being second in
[1:06:43] command he wanted to be the boss
[1:06:49] man like what in the world made him
[1:06:51] think he could take over God's throne
[1:06:56] but he got all puffed up and full of
[1:06:57] Pride he thought he could do God's
[1:07:01] job Satan Saidi so tired of all this
[1:07:04] overshadow on the throne it's my turn to
[1:07:06] sit there I'm going to exalt myself
[1:07:09] above the sons of God I want to rule
[1:07:13] over them I will be their
[1:07:17] God first sin was in heaven Satan fell
[1:07:22] through Pride that should tell us what
[1:07:24] happens if we get Pride
[1:07:26] prideful God will do to us just like he
[1:07:29] did to
[1:07:30] Satan B said Pride such a cursed thing
[1:07:34] so awful so evil is pride he says
[1:07:38] there's another little door called Pride
[1:07:40] oh what a horrible little black devil is
[1:07:42] all pinned up in there thinking you're
[1:07:45] better than somebody else he said I'd
[1:07:48] rather degrade my social standing in the
[1:07:50] community than to rub my name off the
[1:07:53] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:07:55] amen that little pride holds him
[1:07:58] out oh Jesus I'll join the church I'll
[1:08:02] accept you but don't look into my
[1:08:06] closet you can sit in the chair by the
[1:08:08] door but don't look in my
[1:08:12] closet then he can't be your lord he has
[1:08:15] got to have access to every room in the
[1:08:18] house every compartment all the little
[1:08:22] secret things of Life he's got to have
[1:08:24] access to every bit then he becomes
[1:08:31] Lord so here comes your first sin for
[1:08:34] thou Hast said in thine heart I will
[1:08:36] Ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[1:08:38] throne above the stars of God I will sit
[1:08:41] in the Mount of the congregation I will
[1:08:45] Ascend above the heights of the clouds I
[1:08:47] will be like the most high the original
[1:08:51] selfie I I I he probably no doubt took
[1:08:55] his
[1:08:58] iPhone
[1:09:00] woo thank God I got a Samsung
[1:09:05] Galaxy it's my pull pit this
[1:09:10] morning and take a picture no doubt him
[1:09:13] right here by God's Throne this is my
[1:09:15] place right here I'm G to sit here
[1:09:18] that's who we're fighting
[1:09:21] against but thank God yet Thou shalt be
[1:09:25] brought down to Hell to the sides of the
[1:09:32] pit the first battle that were fought
[1:09:35] was not fought on Earth it was fought in
[1:09:37] heaven Michael had his angels against
[1:09:40] Lucifer and they were kicked out of
[1:09:42] heaven then the great Army of the devil
[1:09:45] and all his imps fell upon the Earth and
[1:09:48] God know there's going to be a
[1:09:50] battle I believe he know from the very
[1:09:53] beginning everything that would ever be
[1:09:56] he's
[1:09:59] infinite that great first battle that
[1:10:01] was ever fought begin in
[1:10:04] heaven when Michael and his angels
[1:10:06] fought against Lucifer and his angels
[1:10:09] the first battle was in heaven so sin
[1:10:11] and did not originate on Earth it
[1:10:13] originated in heaven and then he was
[1:10:15] thrown down from
[1:10:16] heaven that battle got brought down to
[1:10:20] Earth where Satan walking the
[1:10:23] Earth seeing what God would was doing he
[1:10:25] heard that God wanted to live in a
[1:10:28] man somehow he found out maybe one of
[1:10:30] the days he was overshadowing God's
[1:10:32] throne and God maybe was looking through
[1:10:34] his book through his
[1:10:36] album he seen Chris
[1:10:39] Watkins they was like who's
[1:10:42] that I ain't telling
[1:10:46] you just showed Satan just enough to wet
[1:10:49] his
[1:10:52] appetite Satan says something's going to
[1:10:55] happen
[1:10:55] happen that somehow he found out that
[1:10:58] God was going to live in man and so
[1:11:00] what' he do he injected his into
[1:11:07] Eve but said the saddest scripture in
[1:11:10] the Bible don't get nervous I'm taking
[1:11:12] this off
[1:11:18] now man
[1:11:27] up a little
[1:11:29] bit said the devil works the same way he
[1:11:32] comes and tries to find something what
[1:11:33] God has did and then try to find
[1:11:35] something to counteract it but God never
[1:11:38] has to change
[1:11:40] his because he
[1:11:42] gave them his word at the beginning he's
[1:11:45] infinite he cannot change it's still his
[1:11:48] word
[1:11:48] today it never changes from his word
[1:11:51] there he is in the word his church is
[1:11:54] fortified by the word
[1:11:59] word his first person was
[1:12:04] fortified Eve but when she stopped just
[1:12:07] a moment to listen to the devil tactics
[1:12:11] so what was his tactics he said it's
[1:12:13] reasoning she just
[1:12:15] reasoned so whenever you hear anything
[1:12:18] that reasons against the word get away
[1:12:21] from
[1:12:22] it it's the devil don't care how
[1:12:26] oldfashioned it
[1:12:28] is how strange it looks When God says so
[1:12:32] it's settled
[1:12:35] eternally get away from anything that
[1:12:38] reasons against the
[1:12:39] word so what happened we're going
[1:12:43] skipping a lot but going into Jesus when
[1:12:45] Jesus was on the earth because Matthew
[1:12:47] 4:1 say Jesus was led up into by the
[1:12:49] spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted
[1:12:51] of the
[1:12:52] devil I'm gonna throw this in here so
[1:12:55] Temptation doesn't come from God it
[1:12:58] comes from the
[1:13:00] devil so when Jesus was up there for 40
[1:13:03] days and 40 nights he was
[1:13:06] hungered and so when the tempter came to
[1:13:09] him says if thou be the Son of
[1:13:11] God command that these Stones be made
[1:13:15] bread he could have done
[1:13:18] it Satan used the word a part of the
[1:13:22] word on Jesus
[1:13:26] but Jesus is going to fulfill the rest
[1:13:28] of it he said you didn't say all of
[1:13:30] it yeah I could turn the stone into the
[1:13:33] bread but it's also written man shall
[1:13:35] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:13:37] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:13:42] God R says yes Thomas after you seen me
[1:13:46] you felt me and put my hand put your
[1:13:49] hands in my side you believed but how
[1:13:52] much greater is their reward who have
[1:13:54] never seen SE and yet believe he's a
[1:13:58] good God he'll give you desire of your
[1:14:00] heart I like this that's the death
[1:14:04] stroke to
[1:14:06] Satan when a man takes God at his
[1:14:11] word that'll kill Satan every
[1:14:17] time that's the hardest hdden that Satan
[1:14:21] can
[1:14:22] get when a man will take God at his word
[1:14:26] so then the devil took him up to the
[1:14:28] holy city and sit upon the Pinnacle of
[1:14:31] the
[1:14:32] temple if thou be the Son of God throw
[1:14:36] yourself down because it is written the
[1:14:39] angels have been charged over thee last
[1:14:41] you dash your foot against the stone
[1:14:42] will catch you before you
[1:14:46] fall Jesus just looks at him again says
[1:14:48] but it is written again Thou shalt not
[1:14:52] tempt the Lord thy God
[1:14:55] and again the devil taken him into an
[1:14:57] exceeding high mountain and showed him
[1:14:59] all the kingdoms of the world and the
[1:15:01] glory of them all this will I give you
[1:15:04] all you got to do is bow down to
[1:15:08] me the devil tried to give Jesus all the
[1:15:11] kingdoms without a
[1:15:16] Calvary because the whole world is
[1:15:19] controlled by Satan every Kingdom in the
[1:15:21] world is ruled by Satan we hate to think
[1:15:24] that that's the scripture the enemy
[1:15:27] taken our Lord into a high exceeding
[1:15:29] Mountain exceeding high and showed him
[1:15:32] all the kingdoms of the world and and he
[1:15:34] said they're all mine he wasn't
[1:15:37] ly they were all
[1:15:40] his Jesus stayed with the
[1:15:43] word he knew he'd fall air to them I
[1:15:46] thank God that he
[1:15:49] didn't that Jesus went on the calvary to
[1:15:51] claim this world because where would we
[1:15:53] be
[1:15:55] brother Travis where would you be this
[1:15:57] morning if Jesus had bowed right then
[1:15:59] and took the
[1:16:00] kingdoms he took it without a Calvary
[1:16:03] none of us would be
[1:16:06] saved but Jesus was tempted to do so he
[1:16:10] knew his
[1:16:11] in he knew what was going to happen
[1:16:14] three and a half years down the
[1:16:18] road Jesus could with his
[1:16:21] power flipped the devil
[1:16:25] but he didn't use his power right he
[1:16:28] used his
[1:16:31] word he didn't overcome the devil as God
[1:16:34] he overcome him as a man to show you how
[1:16:37] you're going to do
[1:16:40] it Jesus said get thee hence Satan for
[1:16:44] it is written Thou shalt Worship the
[1:16:46] Lord thy God in
[1:16:49] him only shalt thou serve and then the
[1:16:52] devil leaveth him
[1:16:55] and behold the Angels Came and
[1:16:56] ministered unto
[1:17:00] him but say showed that how the weakest
[1:17:04] of
[1:17:05] Christians can defeat Satan with just
[1:17:09] the
[1:17:10] word you mean Jesus became a weak
[1:17:16] Christian think about
[1:17:20] it if he showed that how the weakest of
[1:17:22] Christians can defeat Satan with the
[1:17:24] word
[1:17:25] what that make what what make him at
[1:17:27] that
[1:17:28] moment it's like when he was in the
[1:17:30] Garden of Eden when the spirit of God
[1:17:31] left him and he was sitting there crying
[1:17:34] like a man if it be your will let this
[1:17:37] cut pass from
[1:17:41] me he wanted something else but thank
[1:17:45] God he overcome
[1:17:48] himself not thy will but my but not my
[1:17:52] will but thy will be done
[1:17:56] he had powers he could have smoked Satan
[1:17:58] any way he wanted
[1:18:00] to but he didn't use it he just took the
[1:18:03] word and defeated him with it it's
[1:18:06] written it's written everywhere it's
[1:18:10] written so he defeated Satan by the
[1:18:13] word that shows that you can do the same
[1:18:16] thing this
[1:18:17] morning what is bothering
[1:18:21] you what's bothering you
[1:18:26] I don't know what it is you know what it
[1:18:29] is and you know how to defeat
[1:18:32] it it might be hey make these Stones
[1:18:36] bread we know how to answer that
[1:18:37] question don't
[1:18:39] we Bow Down and Worship me well we know
[1:18:42] how to answer that
[1:18:44] question so if you got questions we've
[1:18:47] got
[1:18:49] answers but we don't read it
[1:18:52] enough Move Along
[1:18:57] we believe that God was Tabernacle in
[1:18:59] the flesh so when he met the devil he
[1:19:02] never tried to use any of his powers yet
[1:19:05] the father could have spoke anything
[1:19:07] through
[1:19:08] him and he never used it he used the
[1:19:12] father's written
[1:19:16] word he never used his powers but he
[1:19:19] used God's word it is written man shall
[1:19:23] not live by bread alone
[1:19:25] so he tacked Jesus in his mind just like
[1:19:27] he tacks
[1:19:30] us he tried to get Jesus again in the
[1:19:32] garden to
[1:19:33] Gethsemane when God left
[1:19:36] him we know the story we ain't got
[1:19:40] time
[1:19:43] uhoh my watch is
[1:19:47] vibrating so Jesus for our sins died and
[1:19:49] went to hell
[1:19:54] we all know the story very well so he
[1:19:57] walks up to hell and knocks on the
[1:20:01] door on brother said on down into the
[1:20:03] region of demons on down to the very
[1:20:06] Gates of Hell Jesus took our sins if you
[1:20:10] got burdens today bring it up to the
[1:20:12] Altar and lay it on him because he
[1:20:14] already took it down to hell for
[1:20:18] you he took our burdens he looked down a
[1:20:21] year 2024 and knew what we'd be burdened
[1:20:24] down with
[1:20:25] and said devil I'm going to go ahead and
[1:20:27] give
[1:20:28] you Ethan's
[1:20:32] burdens he's not he's it's going to be
[1:20:34] 2,000 years before he's even born but
[1:20:36] I'm GNA go ahead and give you everything
[1:20:38] that he goes
[1:20:40] through he took everything you go
[1:20:42] through then and gave it back to the
[1:20:47] devil oh I my bird I'm burdened down by
[1:20:51] this what happened to the burden I told
[1:20:53] you what happened to it get rid of the
[1:20:55] burden it's already been gotten away
[1:20:57] from you by God
