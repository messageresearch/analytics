fresh and anew again lord and lord we just commit the service into your hands in the wonderful name of jesus christ we pray that church say amen amen praise god if you have your bibles let's turn to second chronicles second chronicles chapter 36 second chronicles 36 and i want to um i'm going to read it i'll start reading that verse 22. ii chronicles 36 verse 22. now the bible says now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of the lord spoken by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a proclamation throughout all the kingdom and put it into writing thus saith cyrus king of persia all the kingdoms of the earth hath the lord god of heaven given me and he hath charged me to build him a house in jerusalem which is in judah who is there among you of all his people the lord his god be with him and let him go up amen job 32. job chapter 32 and verse 8 job 32 verse 8. the bible says but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding amen may the lord bless you reading of his word you can have your seats amen tonight by the grace of god i want to use for a subject inspiration you know and and and i almost want to put it in the format of a verb catch the inspiration or see the inspiration you know but first of all let's just define inspiration you know and what it means to be inspired you know um throughout the throughout the world throughout the bible men have always been inspired but i want you to understand one thing about inspiration there's two kinds of inspiration there's a good inspiration and there's a bad inspiration now you can be inspired but what are you being inspired by you know and as we look in the scripture you know we could see that the king cyrus of persia he was being inspired but where was that inspiration coming from you know as as we look let's just let's just look at what it means to be inspired the definition of inspired is to fill with an animating quickening or exalting influence see let's just take the word animating if you use the word animating that means it's not usual that means it's a little different hallelujah animating means it's not the normal hallelujah so inspiration a lot of times is not what would normally happen hallelujah so when we take the inspiration of god is not something that happens on a day-to-day basis but it's something that in that moment god is inspiring in that believer's life hallelujah but what i want you to catch is it's a quickening hallelujah it's something that you cannot steal from that individual hell yeah it's something that has been made alive so i'm saying tonight if god ever inspires you to do something it don't matter what the people in the church say hallelujah you can say god told me to do it hallelujah god quickness god made this live in me hallelujah in the next part it says or exalting influence hallelujah to be inspired it's an exalting influence that means no matter what's going on in your life this inspiration has the power to control everything how many know what it means to be inspired by god how do you to be inspired by god it is an exalting influence hallelujah not to put you in the grave but to rise you higher amen hallelujah church tonight we need to catch that inspiration that inspiration hallelujah that influenced us hallelujah above sickness above trials above defeat harley above a lack of understanding hallelujah this inspiration hallelujah it comes upon you and you may not even understand what you're being inspired by amen hallelujah abraham was inspired and didn't even understand it hallelujah god told me you could have a son you have a son and and and and you and sarah and i know y'all oh but hallelujah listen this is what i'm saying church hallelujah to be inspired what is it it's just like king cyrus the bible says right here with king cyrus look what god did in in this verse right here it says it says now in the first year of cyrus king of persia the word of the lord spoken by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished what did god do that the word might be accomplished the bible says he stirred up cyrus spirit when god wants things to take place he stirs us up hallelujah think about that church amen it's not us doing things on our own but it's god stirring us up hallelujah it's god stirring up the pot but you know what a lot of times the only way we can tap into the inspiration is to have trouble in our lives trouble hallelujah brings forth a powerful inspiration hallelujah but you look right here um when you think about god stirring up king cyrus and cyrus he didn't even know what was going on why did he want to do this for the people why did he want to set the people free why did he want to do this particular thing in the kingdom as the king it was god stirring up the spirit to fulfill the word that was spoken already by jeremiah hallelujah so church what i'm saying right now holy god is sending forth or sent forth an inspiration to stir up this church that we may fulfill what brother branham has already preached we're not being inspired hallelujah bye-bye by by just a man from kentucky we're not being inspired by how he dress or how good he talks we're being inspired by the word that was spoken hallelujah it's a quickening it's an exalting influence hallelujah and throughout time men were always stirred up hallelujah men were always inspired and we know our prophet was a man of history and you know when you go back and you look let's look at some men that were inspired before we go back to abraham you know before the inspiration got to us in our day other men had to be inspired holly luther was inspired but what made that inspiration come it was the trouble he saw in the catholic church it was all the things that he saw were going wrong harley and something began to stir up his spirit what was it it was god hallelujah who's the one just saying i'm sick of going to church i'm sick of some sick no god began to stir up his spirit why because he had a word that only luther could bring forth in that day and it was the just shall live by faith so god began to stir up his spirit so he could catch the inspiration why because there were people on the earth at the same time that would catch the same inspiration hallelujah so his thought wasn't just for him here there were a lot of other seas laying dormant in the catholic church hallelujah right there where some were catching the inspiration to be a catholic that would others catch the inspiration to be a lutheran so right under the same umbrella you had some being inspired by god and you had some being inspired by the antichrist [Music] and by god's grace we're gonna show you we're still in that same mode you look luther was inspired but he was the inspiration on luther had limits wow hallelujah this is the inspiration he caught he had limits on it he can be inspired to live by faith but still smoke a pipe he could be inspired by faith but still have a dirty life hallelujah not saying that the inspiration wasn't right but his inspiration had limits on it churchill there were a lot of great men of the world who was inspired one guy i love to talk about he's known all the way throughout history he's known from ages to ages and generations to generations and as long as we have a world his name will be mentioned and it's called his name is adolf hitler do you understand hitler was inspired he didn't just one day say i hate jews no he caught an inspiration but church i want you to understand something holly it may have looked like that hitler was a wicked man but what was he catching he was catching the inspiration that the jews had to go back home on eagle's wings so you're either going to fulfill the good by inspiration or the bad by inspiration just so it was hitler's lot to fulfill the bad but he was definitely inspired and he thought that the germans or or or caucasian race was superior to any other race that was the wrong inspiration because when god created man he created and created all of us equal so what god did to show hitler that he caught the wrong inspiration hallelujah they got inspired hallelujah to have the olympics in germany how many know your history they got inspired to have the olympics in germany because hitler wanted to show how great his inspiration was he wanted to show that his race was a superior race you know what was you know what was stirring hitler up harley his father the devil had the same inspiration amen where he he put all his eggs in a basket built on race and that's what the devil did hallelujah he put it all on race he looked up in heaven and he saw a superior race but what he did he put it on skin color when the superiority wasn't in skin color it was in the seed holy that's how he caught the wrong inspiration just like his father the devil got the wrong inspiration you know what he said he said how you know what i'm gonna get into this race and my seed hallelujah gonna mingle with with the woman's seat and so forth y'all know the story holly but he was catching the wrong inspiration to be like god holly has nothing to do with your flesh god's superior race is in your spirit hallelujah it's in your soul hallelujah it's in your seed hallelujah the right inspiration hallelujah you can't see from the outside amen so when you go back in history you can see they built this big old nice stadium in germany and hit the hallelujah you know he had to not sit marching all that stuff and we're superior we're superior and you know what there was a man hallelujah who was very insignificant hallelujah there was a man it just so happened if y'all don't mind me saying it was a black man and this black man was going to prove to hitler that you got the wrong inspiration that your race is not superior hallelujah it's not her the size of the dog in the fight hurry up it's the size of the fight in the dog and even though hallelujah jesse owens [Music] even though jesse came from hallelujah province conditions and slavery conditions and all these things he had the heart of a lion amen and there was something that stirred him up to be the best that he could be so you know what church when it came time to run jesse trained and trained why did he train so hard he was catching the inspiration wow he was catching the inspiration earlier to prove hitler wrong amen so look at it if hitler was inspired by the devil who was jesse inspired by [Music] hold my church so you know what he trained and he trained and he trained real hard now let's fast forward now they're at the olympics hallelujah and they begin to run the race hallelujah and hitler put his best man out there hallelujah and he was out there running against jesse and you know what has happened jesse smoked him amen oh i know sometimes we we get a little too young jesse won the race hallelujah every other person the best of the best they got smoked by jesse hallelujah and you know what hitler all he could do was sit up there and take it so he put out the next man hallelujah see you can't stop the inspiration of god once it gets to rolling it's like a runaway train it won't stop until it's finished until it meets its destination so you know what happened to jesse did this just win one time it was two times it was three times all the way to six gold medals what a way to shut down the wrong inspiration till it was so hot see when god ever inspires you holy it makes the devil look silly holy teal church jesse won six gold medals i believe it was six six gold medals and after he won hitler was so mad he didn't even shake his hand but that didn't change the fact that jesse won the race church it doesn't matter what the devil is doing in our day no the message is not a mess it's still truth hallelujah it's still scent of god hallelujah it's still vindicated amen and no matter what the devil is saying we're here and inspired by god to make it live again hallelujah but he looked at inspiration and he got the wrong inspiration but there were men on the earth who caught inspiration and it tied right into what god was doing hallelujah you know there was a man hurley who got tired of riding just the horse alone he put it on a buggy said i don't just want to ride by myself but i want to take somebody where i'm going hallelujah so he took the horse and put it to the carriage he was inspired to do that and then there was somebody else who caught his inspiration hurry up but it had a greater value to it hardly why the person that created the horse and buggy he was limit just to that earlier so the next man came along which i believe was henry ford hallelujah and caught the inspiration of the automobile hallelujah a little bit more horsepower but he's still riding on the same inspiration he just got a greater height hallelujah and then there's somebody who came along hey man two brothers called the wright brothers who said you know what the inspiration to drive is all right but i want to get there a little bit faster do you see now i'm gonna say something that's gonna shake your boots say man church we should be listen to me good now we should be inspired hollywood if not on the same level but a little bit greater than the prophet was and he's in the scriptures you ain't in the scripture hallelujah remember he finished his scripture first then we take over hallelujah so church if there's a glory that excels that other glory hallelujah what should we be hallelujah if the glory of moses hallelujah was close was glorious hallelujah what about when we understand that it's god behind that veil amen remember when you catch the right inspiration you know it was god using brother branham and you won't worship the man that's when you catch the right inspiration amen he said as long as the people couldn't go past moses he stayed veiled but when they saw the lord the veil was lifted in church that's where we are hallelujah the veil should be lifted when you read this message you see christ when you read this bible you should see christ when you look in the mirror you should see christ when you see your pastor you should see christ when you come to church you should see christ when you sing songs you should hear christ look look the trouble brought forth more inspiration the need brought forth more inspiration listen hallelujah let me let me read something to you oh my oh my oh my listen inspiration to fill with an animating quickening or exalting influence to produce or arouse hallelujah see church when inspiration comes it's supposed to produce something or it's supposed to arouse something but if it's producing or if it's arousing what is it producing and what is it arousing amen if it's god inspiring it has to be god arousing god or inspiring god hallelujah because god can only connect with himself [Music] listen church listen what he says he says now look the word has to be inspired hearing it recognizing it and acting upon it many people will hear it but won't recognize it in church look for us to to live this message we had to hear it and recognize it that's the problem with people leaving the truth they can't see themselves in the word they don't recognize that the revelation of this message is speaking with you and your relationship with christ you have to see yourself as a part of the word hallelujah look church the uh the prophet of god when he began to talk about moses at the burning bush he said he said what was it he said moses heard his name but then god began to talk to he said it was the word seeing the word amen amen so it's more than just god sent the prophet it's the word seeing the word remember the bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with god hallelujah and you know you drop down to the 12th verse it says and the word became flesh so all the things that we know god is became flesh holy so we should be catching the same inspiration of god holy if you are inspired you're inspired hallelujah as a human no you're not inspired as a human right no we're inspired to be children of god we don't want some earthly inspiration that will perish but we want hallelujah divinely exalting influence most of the people in the scripture when they cut and don't get nervous on about the clothes most of the people in the scripture when they caught the inspiration it was something that wasn't even written it was something that never happened before now let me ask you a question does god change does this inspiration change so you know what church i'm not looking to create squirrels i got my own inspiration i got my own need hallelujah and besides i'm not a hunter so that'll never happen hallelujah i got no need of squirrels hallelujah glory but you look church most of the men and women of god when they were inspired hallelujah they were inspired to bring forth something that did never exist amen oh my church let's go back to abraham remember god told abraham you're going to be the father of faith but for abraham to get that out he had to be inspired but i want you to understand sarah caught inspiration but she caught the wrong inspiration she said yeah we heard what the lord said but i'm going to help it go forth see inspiration is not premeditated inspiration is not you looking in the mirror saying you know what if this happens i'm going to speak the word that's good you might be thinking like that hallelujah but then that might be you hallelujah that might not be god real inspiration it's a stirring it's an arisa is god coming on the scene it's people and i'm gonna say this is people when that inspiration strikes you to fulfill that part of god in your life is people looking at you like you crazy think about it once abraham caught the inspiration he was looking for isaac and he was 90 something years old and you know everybody probably was looking at him and sarah like they're crazy but they caught the inspiration you know before before that sarah she says okay i'm gonna help god hey god this is what i want you to do i want you to take my husband and y'all have a baby and we'll catch the inspiration that was the wrong inspiration because it produced the wrong thing hallelujah how do you know when it's god when it comes forth you see god in it amen you know a lot of times people want to do things they say but god led me god led me and you you don't see any fruits of god he's like a man who says god is leading me just leading me to start a church and he starts a church hallelujah and the church goes on for 15 years and it's just him and his family it's hard for me and this is brother diggs it's hard for me to say that god inspired him to do that with no fruit because if god is inspiring you to do something there will be fruits of god's life coming out of it amen oh you say well you know i think i'm going to buy me a brand new car holly brother matt i'm going to get that maserati hallelujah and i drive up to charlotte i get the maserati and about a month later sister watkins i say man these payments killing me i wasn't inspired by god if that's the outcome if you get something and you're not happy with it don't blame that on god that's your fault hallelujah you caught the wrong inspiration you probably shoulda got a honda hallelujah but if you're inspired we're gonna take it up another notch if you're and god tells you to go get it it can be an r r hallelujah it can be a rolls royce say man but if god has inspired you to get it it don't matter how much it costs you'll be happy driving at the church holiday glory people be looking at you they'll say oh he don't need that he just showed up you say hey i was inspired all is well god is good but when you when we go out and do things and then we reap the repercussions of it you caught the wrong inspiration amen listen um this is the part i like when you look at abraham abraham was he got to a place to where his troubles begin to inspire him to look for answers from god can i get amen has anybody walk down that road now this is gonna shock you but i'm gonna say something that we don't like to hear troubles are a blessing hallelujah troubles are a blessing because no matter what's happening the scripture says it works out for your good so no matter what you're going through no matter what the situation if you are a believer you have a promise that is working out for your good you might not see it in the moment hallelujah but if you stay true to god it will work out for your goodness i wrecked my car it will work out for your good all right oh bro diggs cover 19 made me lose my job it will work out for your good amen are we believers or not are we believers or not see church i'm finding out that some people are just church goals who are you behind the mask hey man we all look alike with a mask on but who are you behind the mask are you really hallelujah a child of god or are you hiding behind the mask are you luke skywalker or are you darth vader god uses trouble to inspire us to catch what he has for us in that moment so that's why my subtitle is catch the inspiration because when you look in the bible most of the time when people says of god got in trouble god was trying to inspire them to go to a higher level church look at moses trouble he's he's he didn't brought the people out the whole time he had the people they were complaining trouble trouble trouble complaining complaining preachers rising up in the church causing confusion trouble trouble trouble his sister and his brother mad at who he married trouble trouble trouble the whole journey was trouble how could he be inspired god put him in a place where he hardly couldn't control god put him in a situation where all he could do was talk back to god and sometimes god put us in a place where all we can do is talk back to him amen your pastor can help the ministry can't help your parents can't help your wife your husband can't help your children can help all you can do is talk to god either it's either it's trouble or it's death but the prophet of god said hallelujah god puts a bit in his mouth and rides it into the presence of god think about that your troubles are carrying you into the presence of god come on somebody god is doing something in our lives and i'm gonna say it again i said it a couple months ago but thank god for the blessings of kovis 19. because this virus is showing who we really are do you believe in isaiah 53 or not do you believe that god is a provider or not do you believe that he's a deliverer or not and as we see the lord approaching do you want to fellowship the more or not because streaming is available that doesn't mean god wants to stay away from each other i don't know about y'all but i love driving these two hours i shouldn't say that i had to use a mountain dew to get down here but i love coming to be with the saints i love seeing brother jason and shaking his hand and brother matt and the different sisters and brothers i love seeing y'all amen and it does mean much more justice seeing you in person than looking at you on a stream from my house why hallelujah because i don't have a scripture for online preaching so i don't get no inspiration from that but i do have a scripture that say we ought to fellowship the more as we see the day approaching so think about the church the more we gather even like this holy in the climate of cobalt 19 inspiration is still here god is still among us hallelujah the virus didn't push god out but the virus brought god closer he's here church hallelujah what else covey did covet has increased our prayer life since watkins i almost gave you a high five just now and you know that would have been god moving if she would have got up and gave me one i know she got it in her spirit holiday once she get home she probably gonna give it to brother jason that's all right sister i take that my church look at covet covet hallelujah holly could it be god stirring up our spirits just in case y'all didn't realize this but this isn't the first epidemic that the world has [Music] they've had epidemics of crack they've got epidemics of crack epidemics of heroin the age epidemic ebola epidemic hallelujah all these different epidemics so what's so different about this i'll tell you more people are believing in the effect of it amen more people are giving it power because the only power sickness has is what we give to it label me a fanatic but hey it is what it is listen listen i might have said this last time listen it's something shaky about this whole thing because how you gonna tell me three months from now they're gonna be more sick people how can you predict sickness if you ain't help pushing it that's like one of you guys walking up to me right now say uh next year december you're gonna have the flu i look at you like you crazy because literally what you're doing you're predicting my future [Music] the devil wants to be so much like god he's trying to predict the future and these unbelievers are believing him amen i'm sorry y'all i know we're supposed to have socialists but let me ask you a question how are you going to distance yourself from god everywhere you go he's there when you wake up he's there when you go to sleep he's there when you're in your car he's there when you're in your church he's there there is no distancing yourself from god amen i'm sorry i'm about to close but church hallelujah there's something real shaky about this whole thing numbers are skyrocketing and now they got people have been inspired like never before they got devices where they just shoot you on the head and tell your temperature i don't know about y'all but i don't like stuff like that like what what what the hell what you doing do my hand put that thing up to my head and i'll do this you just steal my body see if you can get it from my hand why you got to shoot my head call me crazy but that's just me i don't trust nothing that man creates it's always something a little shaky behind it but anyway let me get off there because you know i know we got the people who say well brother dave god gives us a mind he gives us a mind to to to make wise decisions but where's your wisdom coming from come on i gotta ask i got an answer for you the prophet already preached on it wisdom versus faith holy and he said the first time you add your knowledge to it it dies right there oh my i'm just you know i'm just i'm just tired of all the power yeah people are giving this spirit it's just a spirit and just what jesus did in the same day devil come out of them he still his spirit will still do the same thing saint come out of them you call it what you want to covet over know of it whatever 19 20 21 it's all the same a now spirit me ask you something before this covet 19 how did you handle those six periods amen just like you said by the word so what's any different from this you still ought to live by the word holy hey look church hallelujah think about it amen why the inspiration why there are so many people catching the inspiration of sickness our governor hallelujah caught our inspiration he said church is essential hell yeah some of us are trying to cower down but god got the worldly people in our corner telling us no you're going to keep serving god people want to quit but they're keeping the doors open and our president is just on a whole nother level i don't think i've seen one picture one interview anything with him with a mask on and it was if it was such an epidemic you wouldn't protect the leader of the country think about it i know he crazy but think about it think about it i shouldn't say crazy i should say defiant because he's gonna do what he want to do and he'll have the mass in his hand like this swinger well i had it on when i first came in let me let me wind us down church but look what i'm saying church that we've had this message for over 50 years hallelujah so the inspiration should be producing heavenly thoughts we should be seeing hallelujah of body change hallelujah because look what changes our body the word we hear and some of us have been hearing truth divine truth for 20 30 40 years hell yeah so you should see yourself changing into something how by what you're being inspired by amen it's the word that changes us listen this this this this particular quote right here is just so powerful he said look now we say inspiration is is it's an arousal it's god stirring us up it's a it's a uh divine influence but listen this is the prophet he said inspiration is a paradox hallelujah inspiration is a paradox see hollywood you just can't catch it but it's inspired and god moves it right into holly's place just at that hour when you think not now holy if inspiration is a paradox let's listen to a paradox a paradox is something that's unbelievable amen but yet true yeah but did you mean to tell me in this hour of kobe 19 you feel that much more inspired earlier i can't explain it as a paradox yeah i feel even closer to god through all my trials through all my tribulation hallelujah i feel like brother matt how i felt when i just got saved remember when you just got saved you were on fire for god amen that's how i feel inspiration is a paradox it's unbelievable yet true so that's unbelievable but true hallelujah he says how can god take a sinner arrogant high-tempered fussy man and make a saint of god out of him amen it's a paradox what happens that man or that woman gets inspired inspired to live higher life that's what we all church hallelujah listen every time hollywood the saints got inspired it was calling for a higher living from luther to wesley higher living from wesley to to seymour in the saints higher living from brother branham to us you notice i didn't put us in the same category because we're a whole nother generation yeah just like the saints did in the olden days they quoted moses hallelujah for what he had but it was a whole other generation church and we are like i said 50 years post the prophet being here a whole nother generation so it should be requiring a higher way of living a higher life a greater understanding hallelujah look church all the things paul was inspired to preach to his church we understand it [Music] we got the inspiration of preachers that preached years before our prophet preached and then our prophet comes and he says hey will paul's group be there he says because i preached what he preached brother brenham caught the same inspiration but what did he do to believe was life it fulfilled a higher calling because look paul's church at corinth they couldn't walk into love but our message gives us perfect love the hebrew church or the ephesian church they were struggling with adoption hollywood but adoption is our inheritance see church when we really catch the inspiration of this message hallelujah it calls us to a higher standard of living i'm not saying we're comparing ourselves to ourselves no what i'm saying is you should see more of god in your walk listen he says how can he take a woman that's so low till the dogs won't even turn hallelujah to her on the street and make a saint out of a saint of god out of her i can't tell you but he did it it's a paradox sure it is all great works are paradoxes in my closing if we catch the inspiration what i'm saying tonight i want to i want to wrap it up in this last little bit of what i'm saying catch the inspiration for your moment because all of us are in a place we're in a place in our lives hallelujah but we are supposed to catch the inspiration for that moment holy noah cut the inspiration for his moment what was it it was to build a ark to go through the tribulation holy but enoch got the inspiration for his moment and it wasn't to go in the ark it was for the rapture hallelujah both on the earth at the same time but one got the inspiration for something higher than the other one although they both were children of god amen although they both heard from god but they had different moments catch your moment yes amen let's look at abraham holly i know i've said it about five times let's look at abraham church hallelujah god came to him and said abraham i want you to walk before me and be thou perfect amen now he had to catch the inspiration that he could become perfect that he could walk before god and be perfect holy church how did he get there through all the things he went through amen look he leaves him and sarah walking down into abimelech's kingdom the king y'all know i like talking about this the king looking at grandma's again great day grandma fine man i got to have her whoa grandma whoa grandma got it going on you know how the young girls do when they see when they see a nice tall dark hamstring oh he's hot and that's what that's what brimley d looked at sarah he's like oh she's hot i got to have a he's saying this people okay go down there and acquire who she is but look abraham is catching the inspiration holding it but he put it in the wrong filter he's catching the inspiration that sarah hurlia is going through a body change but he missed that body change was for him not for the king amen amen but he was willing to let go of the promise that god gave him holy because he was afraid at the same time he's being inspired but he's catching the wrong inspiration he said sarah you know what you're my sister now you know that's the worst thing you can do you could be a person that halfway lie yeah well you know he really didn't lie because you know they will have sister brothers you know you know how we do sometimes well i really didn't lie i just said it a different way you know your children do that you ask them a question and they won't answer your question direct they go all around your question they trying to answer you without telling the lie say did you go and take that refrigerator well um when i didn't actually win i asked you did you did did you take what day you talking about but church look abraham now he's he's catching the inspiration he's catching the inspiration that his wife has been changed but he got fear connected with it so he can't elevate his living so the king comes down and the king catches his inspiration the king catches his inspiration and comes down and says hey you know i'm looking at this this lady right here she's gorgeous i got to have her and abraham say yeah that's my sister go ahead and take her and king say okay praise god come on come on granny he takes her and then god steps in hallelujah see even in his trouble hallelujah god will not let his promises fall to the ground so even when we mess up the inspiration hallelujah god will bring it back around to the truth why why did god do that because god had to protect himself amen because of the king hallelujah would have got sarah hallelujah and married her and so forth hallelujah it would have made god look like he lied amen so god protects his inspiration amen anyway god comes down tells you y'all know the story said give it back are you good as a dead man so abraham keep going you know not him a lot separating not get down there and sodom you got to go down there fight for life all this trouble all this trouble god comes in god said you know what i'm gonna destroy the whole place and abraham say you know he got inspired he said what if there's 50. well there's 40 30 20 10. he was inspired to save life but all he could save was lot oh my church it was already in him to reflect god and be a savior see the inspiration was there church but look let's fast forward abraham and sarah finally has isaac but he's still supposed to be inspired they finally have isaac and you know then god comes and god want to see did he really catch the inspiration god comes and he says hey i want you to kill him go take them burn them up put them to the stake chop them up do everything you know how you sacrifice so abraham he says okay god gets up off his knees raises up the next morning but now in the midst of everything he heard from god he catches some inspiration wow he heard what god said go offer your son up but then there's a higher inspiration that comes this way holy something that god didn't even say to him amen something that has never been spoken before hallelujah but he's being inspired hallelujah and he he he he gathers up all the bags and everything he tells isaac come but before he leaves he looks at his servants and he says i'm the lag gonna go and now the lag gonna turn what was that that was inspiration god didn't tell him that where did it come from it was the nature of the seed coming out in the midst of trouble church in the midst of your trouble who do you reflect amen and because abraham was the father of faith that's who he was in the midst of his trouble all he could do was reflect that he is the father of faith so church from there he's inspired and he tells us she tells his servants i'm the last gonna go and out of that gonna turn gonna return now that's in the air the spoken word has went out holy and you know the bible says hallelujah that no word will return unto god void nothing will come back but it'll go out and accomplish that which he's sent it out to do holly so now abraham is speaking as a god he's inspired he says how to let him go out of the leg return so he gets out there he gets to the spot he sees the area he starts to build y'all to hallelujah he's inspired he's building an altar he tells isaac go gather some wood isaac go gathers the wood holly now isaac is looking around and he's catching the inspiration he says hey something right he says hey dad we got the altar we even got the wood but where's the sacrifice here comes the inspiration he says god shall provide himself a sacrifice and right there in that moment those words of inspiration created what he needed in that moment what about you in your moment he's still god it's still he's still inspiring us but you know we do we're so afraid of being wrong if it's real inspiration it's not you it's god amen let me close i got a lot of things i can say but i think you got me listen when the prophet of god was talking about job he said job was trying to catch the inspiration he said while he was going through all that different stuff he was trying to catch the inspiration he said when you know you've doubted every dotted every eye and crossed every t he said that's when you hold still and you know that god is with you no you have to be certain of god then that's when you catch the right inspiration but when you catch it for your moment holy there'll be things that take place hallelujah that may not even be written on paper amen church a couple weeks ago we was having church and after we had church it turned into a praise service and we worshiped and we sung for about another hour and a half and it was a sister visiting because one of the brothers one of the brothers had had a wedding and it was a sister visiting from up north north northern south carolina her and her daughter they were visiting and i was preaching a message that sunday morning called god turning your negative into a positive amen and i was saying that morning that you have to go through the negative before you get to the positive because it's the negative hallelujah that makes the positive what it is hallelujah you know we'll say a lot of times no no i just i just want the blessings of god no holy it's the things you suffer that brings forth the character it ain't the mountaintops experiences it's the valley lows holly but anyway i was preaching about the negative it's negative and negative and so much and turn into a positive and look hallelujah church i made a statement and i said hey you could have the nicest car in the parking lot you have gas spot plugs every stuff all that but if your battery is not grounded to the negative the car won't move so would you be who you are without the negative experiences you've had i'll say it again like i said earlier thank god for my trouble it was rehab prostitution that led her to escape it was a woman being a harlot hallelujah he was the other woman being a prostitute that led her the way of the alabaster box it's the trouble church but anyway i was preaching i was preaching in that service it was that same sister she said god spoke to her and told her you're gonna get your healing today and we were just worshiping and praising god and everything and she said i kept saying you got to go through the negative you got to go through the negative and she said god she was sitting in her seat and god was saying to her you're going to get your healing today right in the service you're going to get your healing today hold it and let me tell you something we didn't even pray for amen god was inspiring her just accept it right here right now just accept it right now hello so church she caught up hallelujah her daughter told us mama get up and tell what god is doing tell your testimony her daughter told her she said no i don't know these people she said she said mama don't miss your chance to testify about what god is doing amen so she got up and she started to testify and she said you know what y'all god told me that i'm gonna get my healing right here in the service holidays hallelujah and the doctors told her she had breast cancer or something like that hallelujah turf when she went back to that was sunday when she went back that tuesday to get her examination hallelujah she was cancer-free if god is inspiring you is not to fail is to try out amen church i'm i'm excited what god is doing i i i just thank god the lord is so good i got a testimony but i'ma hold it i'm gonna hold it because it's just whoa wow god is so good he's just working church amen working hallelujah hold on let me close come on musician over and over and over again we ought to be able to see the hand of god in our lives you know i was laying in a bed matt and the lord was just showing me my life and you know what god it with me and i'm not being arrogant i'm not boasting on myself but i'm boasting on god what the lord shared with me is you have lived a supernatural life amen amen by god's grace i've lived a supernatural life hallelujah church i've come through all kinds of sicknesses that been pronounced hallelujah i've seen god providing ways hallelujah like never before churching at some of my weakest moments i i felt like strength come in like angels and god has been saying to me keep pressing [Music] church may the 29th in the midst of all this cobra 19 stuff we was having service and we had powerful service and after the service assist not after the service but doing the song service a sister song and then after she saw she was singing the song praises what i do and as she finished singing a song she started speaking in tone and then she started interpreting first thing she said hallelujah she started dressing my pasta and it was god saying she said she said that the voice coming from her say pastor anderson it is i who told you to keep this church open because i'll be honest church we didn't even do like y'all we just kept coming pastors getting criticized people using scripture all kind of stuff you know obey season and do all this stuff you know what i mean but he just felt glad to keep the doors open keep coming then the prophecy comes forth and tells everybody be quiet i'm god i told him to keep this church open because there are people who want to worship and they need some place to worship he said so i led him to keep the doors open hallelujah and said some more things to my pastor hallelujah and then through the same interpretation and start addressing me [Music] and god began to speak to me and begin to tell me hallelujah that your footsteps have been ordered now what am i going to do am i going to complain or am i going to rejoice [Music] hallelujah god comes and he begins to speak to you talk to you call you by name and tell you keep pressing my son hallelujah keep pressing my son holy don't look to the left or to the right but you keep pressing my son hallelujah i have ordered your footsteps hallelujah and then he came and he said i have heard your desire amen finish he said it is i who upholds thee so i ain't keeping myself god told me it's him keeping me know what that did for me [Music] church from that moment it didn't matter what i was going through after that god comes and tells me sister washington it's me i'm in control i could have been walking with a broke arm and then god comes and says it's me i'm in control [Music] oh my church i'm telling you church we ought to be looking for more of god let's pray lord jesus father we

appreciate the word of god you may give him a hand clapping praise hallelujah amen thank you brother dick that was just wonderful amen that was awesome amen just what i needed amen i say lord i want to be inspired by the right thing you know i was thinking just last week i've read a couple scriptures in romans 9 7 the bible talks about pharaoh and says for this same purpose speaking of pharaoh the pharaoh who persecuted the egyptians i mean the israelites out of egypt and uh and and you know you know the entire story of the exodus and paul says for this purpose god said for this purpose i raised you up so there was an inspiration that someone had to fulfill and he was raised up for a purpose i thought of the same thing about judas and over in acts it says acts 1 16 says men and brethren this scripture speaking of judas must needs have been fulfilled which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spoke before concerning judas which was which was to guide them that took jesus i thought about that and thought everyone has to play a part everybody the republicans has to play a part the democrats have to play a part the catholic church has to play a part the evangelicals have to play a part you know brother branham said there's three kinds of believers and he said there's a mate believer there's an unbeliever and then there's a believer and you know brother diggs after hearing that tonight i'll just go further and say that there's an inspiration for the unbeliever to not believe there's an inspiration for the make believer to make believe but i'm glad there's an inspiration for the believer and it's to believe the word of god and i say lord let me play my part let me not be a pharaoh let me not be a judas amen let me come under the right inspiration amen that was wonderful brother diggs thank you so much i know that was a blessing to all of those amen online who couldn't be here tonight i trust the word was amen was uh was a blessing to you amen we have
