[37:35] and darkness comprehended it not think
[37:37] about how privileged you are to to be
[37:40] here tonight and to be able to
[37:41] comprehend the light of this hour now he
[37:44] made two points Jesus makes two points
[37:46] and you're going to decide right now
[37:49] which one you're
[37:50] in he said the world who loves sin hates
[37:56] the light
[37:58] and the reason for that is is because
[38:01] the light exposes their sinfulness so
[38:04] they don't want nothing to do with it
[38:05] but he talks about that the righteous
[38:08] love the light and they come to the
[38:11] light now I don't want my problems
[38:15] exposed to you and you don't need your
[38:17] problems exposed to the person beside
[38:19] you but I sure want to be exposed to me
[38:21] I want to know if I got a problem I want
[38:24] to come to light how many say Lord I

[38:28] I'm willing to submit myself to the to
[38:32] the to the microscope to the spotlight
[38:34] of the Holy Spirit and say Lord let your
[38:36] word shine down into my heart tonight
[38:41] and show me what I need how many how
[38:43] many is that the category you want to be

[41:09] amen but there's a whole house full of
[41:10] Believers tonight amen that believe that
[41:13] he is the same yesterday today and

[41:19] made that promise that we're two or
[41:20] three are gathered together he would be
[41:22] in their midst he said but it's he said
[41:24] it's really depending on the attitude of
[41:26] the two three that's there towards the
[41:29] one who's in their midst and I wonder
[41:31] tonight how many say Lord just give me

[44:54] and helping them and working out of the
[44:56] church there there and evangelizing and
[44:58] so brother Matt said to be sure and
[44:59] bring his greetings here I'm sure we'd
[45:01] have probably had some young folks from
[45:02] the church here this weekend but we're
[45:04] actually uh having meetings there this
[45:06] weekend so amen I preach there Wednesday
[45:08] and come over here on Thursday so amen
[45:10] it's an honor to be here and we want to
[45:12] thank the Lord again for this
[45:14] opportunity to be speaking with brother
[45:15] Donnie amen a real man of God a friend
[45:17] of ours and a buddy how many appreciate
[45:19] that word last night amen wasn't that a
[45:23] masterpiece amen amen I tell you I
[45:27] sitting there I sitting there listening
[45:29] to brother Donnie preached last night
[45:30] about halfway through that I thought the
[45:32] devil's probably hating the fact that he
[45:33] sent that hurricane amen through these
[45:36] mountains amen CU he didn't know a Son
[45:38] of God was going to take what he'd done
[45:40] in the natural and take it to the
[45:41] spiritual and expose that devil amen but
[45:43] we say God bless you brother Donnie
[45:45] thank you for your labors and we know it
[45:47] is a real sacrific for him to be here
[45:48] this weekend and of course all the
[45:50] ministry all the ministering Brothers
[45:51] God richly bless you all and amen we
[45:54] love the Lord tonight if you have your
[45:55] Bibles we want to go to the book of
[45:57] Psalms the 132nd chapter but first
[46:01] rather we're going to go to Psalms
[46:02] 23 I know this is a very very familiar
[46:06] scripture to us tonight in Psalms 23 and
[46:09] then we'll go to Psalms 132 and also
[46:12] Philippians chapter 4 amen you love the
[46:15] Lord
[46:16] tonight amen as I said this is a
[46:19] familiar Psalm I believe even brother
[46:21] Donnie referred to it last night but in
[46:23] Psalms chapter 23 and verse one David
[46:27] here is writing he says now the Lord is
[46:31] my shepherd He says I shall not want
[46:35] when you look at the definition of that
[46:36] word want it means to diminish for a
[46:39] lack of need so David is saying I have
[46:42] needs but the Lord is my shepherd and my
[46:45] needs are not going to cause me to
[46:47] decrease or to diminish so we could say
[46:49] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[46:51] diminish for a lack of something to
[46:54] supply my need now in the book of
[46:56] proverb Psalms 132 Psalms 132 I want to
[47:00] read a portion of scripture there in
[47:03] Psalms 132 and beginning at verse number
[47:06] 13 David here again is writing in Psalms
[47:10] 132 and verse
[47:12] 13 and he says for the Lord hath chosen
[47:16] Zion so this is not something he's doing
[47:19] but it's something he's already done for
[47:21] the Lord hath chosen Zion and he hath
[47:24] desired it for his habitation this is my
[47:27] rest forever here will I dwell for I
[47:32] have desired it now watch verse 15 I
[47:35] will abundantly bless her provision and
[47:38] I will satisfy her poor with bread
[47:42] notice who's doing this the Lord I will
[47:45] also clothe her priest with salvation
[47:47] and her Saints shall shout Al loud for
[47:51] Joy there will I make the Horn of David
[47:54] to Bud for I have ordained a lamb for my
[47:57] anointed I love Verse 18 his enemies
[48:01] will I clothe with shame but upon
[48:04] himself shall his crown flourish in
[48:06] other words David's enemies would be
[48:08] clothed with shame but David would be
[48:11] exalted in the book of Philippians
[48:13] chapter 4 I want to read one verse there
[48:16] in Philippians chapter 4 I know that's
[48:19] another very very familiar reading to
[48:21] you but in Philippians chapter 4 and: 19
[48:24] Paul here writing he says but my God
[48:27] shall supply all your need according to
[48:31] his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus
[48:34] let's just read that verse together but
[48:36] my God shall supply all your need
[48:39] according to his riches and Glory by
[48:43] Christ Jesus we ask the Lord this
[48:45] evening to add the blessing to the
[48:46] reading of his word as you can have your
[48:48] seats here this afternoon I want to by
[48:50] the help of the Lord for just a few
[48:51] moments tonight if I would take a title
[48:54] here tonight I want to talk to you for a
[48:55] few moments here on Zion accepting God's
[48:59] provision Zion accepting God's provision
[49:03] now we read there in Philippians chapter
[49:05] 4 and verse 19 and I just want to share
[49:07] that verse to you uh from the Amplified
[49:09] Bible if that'd be okay he says there in
[49:11] Pro Philippians 4:19 he says my God will
[49:15] liberally Supply he will F until full
[49:18] your every need amen my God will
[49:21] liberally Supply he will F until full
[49:24] your every need according to his riches
[49:27] in glory in Christ Jesus now I I just
[49:30] want to read a quote here to lay a
[49:31] foundation
[49:32] 1963 accepting God's provided way at the
[49:35] end time he says and now for a text I
[49:38] would like to speak from this on this is
[49:40] accepting God's provided way for the end
[49:43] time he said now let me quote that again
[49:45] because on the tapes I believe they're
[49:47] taping these messages how many's
[49:48] thankful for the tapes amen he said and
[49:51] all these tapes that we have we have
[49:52] some 500 texts that I guess I've
[49:54] preached from he said now they've got
[49:57] something similar to that amen but not
[50:00] exactly this see they've got something
[50:02] similar to that but not exactly this
[50:05] accepting God's provided way at the end
[50:08] time now you that studied the message
[50:10] you know he preaches God's provided way
[50:12] for healing and God has made a way he
[50:14] preaches many sermons even back in the
[50:16] 40s and the 50s leading up to this time
[50:19] preaching on God providing a a way but
[50:22] in 1963 right at the change of the
[50:24] ministry he says now God has provided a
[50:27] way at the end time so he's no longer
[50:30] just saying what God has done amen but
[50:33] now he's saying what the god done back
[50:35] there amen he is able to do here because
[50:37] we're no longer in the beginning amen
[50:40] but we've now come to the end he said
[50:42] now you know there's many ways that
[50:44] people can take but really he said
[50:46] there's only two ways that a man can go
[50:48] he said that's the right way and the
[50:50] wrong way and all of us here tonight he
[50:52] said we're on those roads the right or
[50:54] the wrong one see there's no middle
[50:56] ground because Jesus said you cannot
[50:58] serve God and Mammon which he meant the
[51:01] world he said we're either right or
[51:03] we're wrong he said now if we'll just
[51:05] get away from our own way is the only
[51:08] way that we can get into God's way I
[51:10] want you to think about that looking
[51:12] here tonight maybe 350 400 people amen
[51:15] there's there's many different ways amen
[51:18] represented here tonight like you have a
[51:19] way you do something you have a way you
[51:21] do something and that's in the natural
[51:23] amen but if we turn it to the spiritual
[51:25] if you're going to see God do anything
[51:27] in the in the meeting or in the services
[51:30] you got to come out of the way you think
[51:31] it ought to be done and you've got to
[51:33] come into what God has established by a
[51:35] Vindicated Prophet see he said God has
[51:38] made a way amen provided a way for
[51:40] everything he has provided the way he
[51:43] said and where we get in trouble is not
[51:45] following that way and injecting into it
[51:48] our own ways and that makes a perversion
[51:51] and anything that is that is perverted
[51:54] amen is not dependable so any way out
[51:56] side of this message amen is a
[51:58] perversion therefore it's not Dependable
[52:01] therefore it should not have any time in
[52:03] our services or in our lives God Amen
[52:06] has made a way now when God makes a way
[52:09] man as always usually amen rejects the
[52:12] provided way of God Amen and begins to
[52:14] try to add to the way or to improve it
[52:16] or to amen take something out of it but
[52:19] let me just say this God's ways amen are
[52:22] perfect amen they're not they're not
[52:23] imperfect they're not partial amen but
[52:26] God 's ways are perfect therefore amen
[52:29] how can you add to or take away from
[52:31] Perfection amen if you take away from it
[52:34] it's no longer perfect amen and if you
[52:36] add to it it's no longer perfect amen
[52:38] because perfect is perfect whether you
[52:40] think it is or not I think of Solomon's
[52:43] words when he said there in Proverbs
[52:44] 14:12 he said there is a way amen which
[52:48] seeth right unto a man amen but the end
[52:51] thereof are the ways of death now I just
[52:53] want to say this there is a vast
[52:55] difference a in something that seeth
[52:58] right amen and knowing something is
[53:00] right right amen it's one thing to think
[53:02] something is right or to feel that
[53:04] something is right or to amen have some
[53:06] type of inclination that something is
[53:07] Right amen but when you can stand there
[53:09] and say I know this is right amen you
[53:12] have now gone beyond the element of
[53:14] presuming and you have stepped over into
[53:16] Authority now you know as brother Donnie
[53:18] said last night there's many
[53:20] denominations amen and every one of them
[53:22] are walking Amen in the way which seeth
[53:25] right amen unto a man very funny thing
[53:28] to me that people say the people the
[53:29] message amen are following a man amen
[53:32] but in reality the Baptist or baptizing
[53:34] the way a man thinks they ought to
[53:36] baptize amen the Pentecostals are
[53:38] breaching the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[53:40] based on Amen the way a man thinks the
[53:42] Holy Ghost should be identified in the
[53:44] life of a Christian but here a Prophet
[53:46] come among us and said see all these
[53:48] denominations are walking amen but they
[53:51] don't have an absolute and so because
[53:54] they don't have an absolute amen they've
[53:56] G got to find something or make a choice
[53:58] or somebody has got to raise up among
[54:01] them and say this is the way to go and
[54:02] this is the way to baptize amen are you
[54:04] hearing me tonight what they do is they
[54:07] choose to walk Amen in a way that seeth
[54:10] right but a prophet said see you've got
[54:12] to come amen not the way that seems
[54:15] right amen but the way God says is Right
[54:18] amen see and that's the way of the Cross
[54:21] amen we ought to just get it out in the
[54:22] open tonight there's no other way a man
[54:24] can be saved amen out side of the shed
[54:27] blood of Jesus Christ that is coming in
[54:29] this age amen by the preaching of the
[54:32] Cross of Calvary there is no other way
[54:34] amen joining a church is not God's way
[54:37] it's a way that seems right amen just
[54:39] accepting that God has sent a prophet
[54:42] amen is not God's way it is a way that
[54:45] seems right amen now let me just go
[54:47] ahead and say it amen just going to a
[54:49] certain church or following on a certain
[54:50] Ministry amen and getting some idea that
[54:52] I'm okay amen that's not God's way God's
[54:56] way is the cross I say then tonight that
[54:59] the way of God Amen is right because
[55:02] it's the way amen of the word brother
[55:04] said what a Christian needs today in
[55:06] this atomic age this time of uncertainty
[55:09] amen you need something besides just an
[55:12] experience amen of joining church he
[55:15] said what you need is an anchor what you
[55:17] need is an absolute that you know
[55:20] because churches will fail and people
[55:22] will fail but Christ amen cannot fail he
[55:25] is the ABS absolute to the believer and
[55:27] if Christ is your absolute you are tied
[55:30] to him and if he is your absolute you
[55:32] are tied to him then you're tied to the
[55:35] word now that tells whether we got the
[55:37] right absolute or not see if you can
[55:39] read it in the scripture amen something
[55:42] that Christ has ordained or commissioned
[55:44] us to do and because there's some
[55:46] twisting around if someone would tell
[55:48] you well that was for the disciples or
[55:50] that was for someone else you don't need
[55:52] to hold on to that amen then Christ is
[55:55] not your absolute
[55:56] the very second a person tells you
[55:59] something amen contrary to the word of
[56:01] God and you begin to walk in what
[56:03] they've told you amen you're no longer
[56:05] walking with an assurance amen that the
[56:08] way you're walking in is right he said
[56:10] the person amen who led you out of the
[56:13] way is your absolute he said but if that
[56:15] word Christ still holds amen see then
[56:18] he's your absolute and we mustn't let
[56:21] anything stir us amen out of the way of
[56:24] the word I really don't care care what
[56:26] Hollywood thinks I really don't care
[56:28] what denomination thinks I really don't
[56:30] care what Society thinks listen God has
[56:33] sent a message in this generation and it
[56:35] is not something that has been done in a
[56:37] corner somewhere it has been Vindicated
[56:40] around the world seven times if there's
[56:42] ever been a time that we ought to come
[56:44] back Amen to the homeland of the church
[56:46] amen the message of the hour amen the
[56:49] absolute that has been brought to this
[56:50] age I say now is the time to do it I say
[56:53] thank God tonight we are not walking
[56:55] amen in a man's choice we are not
[56:58] walking in a man's way but we are
[57:00] walking in God's choice he said all
[57:02] these denominational ages 900 and
[57:05] something amen different Protestant
[57:07] denomination he said each one of them of
[57:09] course you could see their idea he said
[57:11] I can't blame them amen each one claims
[57:13] that they are the truth now think about
[57:15] that they're everyone claiming that they
[57:18] are the truth he said that they have the
[57:20] truth and the people that belongs to
[57:23] those churches should believe that
[57:25] because they have St amen their
[57:27] destination listen their Eternal
[57:30] destination upon the teaching of that
[57:32] church and they're so much different one
[57:35] from the other till it makes 900 and
[57:37] something different questions therefore
[57:39] being 900 and something different
[57:41] questions there's got to be one correct
[57:43] answer listen 900 denominations amen but
[57:47] every one of them has their own answers
[57:49] amen but there's only really one correct
[57:51] answer he said listen and I would like
[57:53] for us tonight amen being that we are
[57:56] trying to go to heaven and to meet our
[57:58] lord Jesus who we all love he said I
[58:01] would like to search in the scripture
[58:03] Amen to find that one correct answer
[58:06] listen I know you may not think it's
[58:07] very important what you believe amen but
[58:10] let me just tell you tonight amen what
[58:12] you believe amen will make a journey and
[58:15] that Journey has a destination and I
[58:17] don't know about you I'm not headed for
[58:19] tribulation I'm not headed for hell I'm
[58:22] not headed for the world Amen I have
[58:24] come from God and I've got to go back to
[58:26] God you have come from God you got to go
[58:29] back to God and there's only one thing
[58:31] that can take you back amen is what God
[58:34] has provided to get you there listen
[58:36] friends I want to say it as plain as I
[58:37] know how our destination is
[58:40] heaven amen our destination is heaven
[58:43] and the prophet of God said don't be
[58:45] afraid no matter how many atomic bombs
[58:47] they have how many hydrogen bombs they
[58:49] have how much they speak of this and

[59:42] message of Grace amen Grace is going to
[59:46] take us to our destination if there is a
[59:49] Bible question then there should have a
[59:51] Bible answer well let me just say what a
[59:53] prophet said he said notice being
[59:55] personally identified by the original
[59:57] headship amen we have the answer to the
[1:00:01] devil's question amen glory we have the
[1:00:03] answer it is he Christ is risen and has
[1:00:07] paid the price and is raising up the
[1:00:10] body and the devil can't stand it he
[1:00:13] said that's the reason these ecumenical
[1:00:15] kingdoms are setting up that's the
[1:00:17] reason they're doing what they're doing
[1:00:18] now amen that's the reason the devil is
[1:00:20] howling the way he is is his wickedness
[1:00:23] his scheme has been uncovered amen by
[1:00:26] the resurrected Christ in the headship
[1:00:29] over his body listen as long as it's a
[1:00:32] headless body it does not have a
[1:00:34] Direction but when a head comes to a
[1:00:36] body wherever the head goes amen there
[1:00:39] is where the body will go oh young
[1:00:42] people thank God tonight we're not
[1:00:44] following 900 different denomination but
[1:00:47] there has been a resurrection in the end
[1:00:49] time it has come the rising of the Sun
[1:00:52] and we now have original headship
[1:00:55] returned to the church listen we're not
[1:00:57] following this man and following this
[1:00:59] program we're following the same Pillar
[1:01:01] of Fire that led Moses out of Israel
[1:01:04] that led Paul to the road Damascus and
[1:01:06] changed him from Saul to Paul has come
[1:01:09] right here Amen to Carolina points on a
[1:01:11] Friday night Amen to meet somebody who
[1:01:14] is a part of the rapturing Church of
[1:01:17] Jesus Christ and their bodies shall come
[1:01:19] subject to the absolute that has been
[1:01:21] revealed in the age we're living in
[1:01:24] listen we're not following the first
[1:01:25] pull it's already fulfilled we're not
[1:01:28] looking for a repeat of the second pull
[1:01:30] it's already fulfilled our pool is a
[1:01:33] third
[1:01:35] pull come on young people our pull is a
[1:01:38] third pull brother said see in that
[1:01:40] Vision he said I heard him speak he said
[1:01:42] now I'll meet you in
[1:01:45] there now you young people know that
[1:01:48] there's been a lot of people add to that
[1:01:49] and take away from it amen and they've
[1:01:51] got this idea and they got that idea but
[1:01:53] let's just say what a prophet said he
[1:01:55] said and there there would be a Time
[1:01:57] come forth when he could express himself
[1:02:00] in the fullness of his godhead amen
[1:02:03] deity through his church listen the
[1:02:06] third pull is the revelation of the word
[1:02:09] coming into the Flesh of the church and
[1:02:11] Christ for the first time in 2,000 years
[1:02:15] having Supreme preeminence in a redeemed
[1:02:18] body he said see through his church
[1:02:20] having the preeminence in this church he
[1:02:23] said what the anointed man am but now
[1:02:26] the anointed people oh my to bring back
[1:02:30] amen the anointed bride and the
[1:02:32] bridegroom he said anointed by what what
[1:02:34] are we anointed by are we anointed by
[1:02:37] the music are we anointed by fancy words
[1:02:39] are we anointed by cliches are we
[1:02:42] anointed by a preacher's personality
[1:02:44] listen we are anointed amen by accepting
[1:02:47] what Eve turned down and Adam see coming
[1:02:51] back with the anointing of the word
[1:02:53] because he said that my word is spirit
[1:02:56] see it's the anointed with the word
[1:02:58] listen what Eve turned down he will come
[1:03:01] back and we accept what Eve turned down
[1:03:05] will return and we will accept it no
[1:03:08] wonder a prophet stood there and said
[1:03:10] accepting God's provided way in the end
[1:03:14] time he knew what they rejected in the
[1:03:16] beginning but there was a promise if
[1:03:18] there was a first Adam there would be a
[1:03:20] second adom if there was a first Eve
[1:03:23] there would be a second Eve oh young
[1:03:25] people you are the second Eve tonight
[1:03:27] who has come in contact with the return
[1:03:31] of the authority of the Resurrection In
[1:03:33] the Flesh of the redeemed
[1:03:35] Church my my my listen Eve turned it
[1:03:39] down but it's going to come back and
[1:03:42] somebody's going to accept it well I
[1:03:44] want to put that devil on notice I'm a
[1:03:47] part of the second Eve I'm a part of the
[1:03:50] Church of the firstborn I refuse to
[1:03:53] accept a man's idea I refused to accept
[1:03:56] the denomination I have been privileged
[1:03:59] to accept the original word in the power
[1:04:02] of its Authority listen according to
[1:04:04] Matthew 5 my Bible says this blessed are
[1:04:07] they that do hunger and thirst after
[1:04:09] righteousness for what they might be
[1:04:12] filled there's a possibility they might
[1:04:14] get something no my Bible says they
[1:04:17] shall be filled he said if God has given
[1:04:20] us that blessed promise then the only
[1:04:22] thing that would keep us being filled
[1:04:24] with everything we thirst for for would
[1:04:26] be because we do not believe it we could
[1:04:29] just believe now that God will give the
[1:04:31] very thing that we're here for we'll all
[1:04:34] go home tonight and be happy and
[1:04:36] satisfied I'm so glad that he supplies
[1:04:39] our every need he promised he would do
[1:04:42] that he said now he never promised that
[1:04:45] he would Supply our wants but it was our
[1:04:48] needs that he would Supply he said I'm
[1:04:51] so glad of that because there's many
[1:04:53] times here a prophet now there's many
[1:04:55] times that we want things that's not
[1:04:58] good for
[1:04:59] us there's many times that we want
[1:05:02] things that's not good for us now amen
[1:05:04] it's Youth Camp so can I just preach a
[1:05:06] little bit amen you know what you want
[1:05:08] sometimes you want a new iPhone you want
[1:05:11] a new iPad or a new computer or a new
[1:05:13] video game or you get to that age amen
[1:05:15] amen that little car that you just so
[1:05:17] happy to get five months ago you get
[1:05:19] embarrassed of it you know you know what
[1:05:21] I'm talking about you start warning
[1:05:23] things can I say this there's a
[1:05:25] difference and our wants and our needs
[1:05:27] let me say this we want a new car or we
[1:05:29] want a new boat or we want a new iPad we
[1:05:32] don't need a new iPhone we don't really
[1:05:34] need a new iPad if we really let the
[1:05:37] rubber hit the road what we need is a
[1:05:39] Rapture what we need is a body change
[1:05:41] what we need is a resurrection what we
[1:05:44] need is this world Amen to pass away and
[1:05:47] come underneath the Redemption process
[1:05:49] of the word of God what we really need
[1:05:51] is to go to heaven what we really need
[1:05:53] is to see our babies saved what we
[1:05:55] really need to see is the Holy Ghost
[1:05:57] amen fill every hearts and fill every
[1:05:59] life I say oh God come among us this
[1:06:01] weekend as the god of Abraham Isaac and
[1:06:04] Jacob who swore he would give us the
[1:06:07] things that we have need of yes sir see
[1:06:09] that's the confidence of the believer in
[1:06:12] his maker is he promised to meet the
[1:06:14] need now I haven't left my title amen
[1:06:17] Zion accepting God's provision look at
[1:06:20] this word provision Webster says it is
[1:06:22] the action of providing or supplying
[1:06:26] something for use right so when
[1:06:29] something is a provision it's not just
[1:06:32] there to be there but it's there for use
[1:06:35] see it's an amount or things supplied or
[1:06:38] provided it means to supply with food or
[1:06:40] to drink amen or equipment especially
[1:06:44] for a journey so brother John there is a
[1:06:46] direct connection between amen amen our
[1:06:49] provision our journey and our
[1:06:52] destination our provision our journey
[1:06:55] and destination in Psalms 132 David says
[1:06:58] these beautiful words he says the Lord
[1:07:01] hath chosen Zion 1964 future home
[1:07:05] brother comes along and says now
[1:07:06] remember amen Zion is always the bride
[1:07:10] so I could very well say Amen the bride
[1:07:14] accepting God's provision in Psalms
[1:07:16] 132:15 he says I will abundantly bless
[1:07:20] her provision Church of the Living God
[1:07:23] you want something to shout about amen
[1:07:25] amen it ain't a new song It Ain't a hot
[1:07:28] guitar it ain't a good set of drums amen
[1:07:30] if you want to shout about something
[1:07:32] amen you ought to be shouting that God
[1:07:34] who is rich in Mercy has provided an
[1:07:38] abundance of provision in the age you're
[1:07:40] living in when denominations have dried
[1:07:42] up when the world has fallen apart when
[1:07:45] systems have reached their end when men
[1:07:47] have gone crazy trying to fix the
[1:07:49] problems of the world but in the days of
[1:07:51] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:07:53] shall begin to sound there will be a
[1:07:56] message that will tie all the loose
[1:07:57] hands together and there will be a table
[1:08:00] that will be set in the presence of my
[1:08:02] enemies I will feed on a seven course
[1:08:05] meal I will feed on the Seven Seals you
[1:08:08] will feed on the Revelation in an age
[1:08:10] that's in a famine God has provided an
[1:08:13] abundant provision look at this word
[1:08:15] provision you know what provision is
[1:08:18] it's a food
[1:08:20] supply oh brother R said look he said if
[1:08:23] we're going to have an understanding of
[1:08:24] God it must come out of God's word for
[1:08:27] the word is what God has gave us to feed
[1:08:31] our hungry
[1:08:32] souls and the holy spirit amen was sent
[1:08:36] to take the word of God and to feed us
[1:08:39] by the word you see it the holy spirit
[1:08:42] is sent from God to take the word of God
[1:08:46] and to give it to us as we have need now
[1:08:49] I'm so glad that God has made a
[1:08:51] provision like
[1:08:53] that aren't you
[1:08:56] that he would feed us David goes on to
[1:08:59] say I will abundantly bless her
[1:09:01] provision and I will satisfy look at
[1:09:03] this word satisfi it means to be
[1:09:06] fulfilled it means to have one's feel of
[1:09:09] it means to have an excess so here David
[1:09:12] is saying God will give us an excess
[1:09:15] amen I will satisfy her poor look at
[1:09:18] this word poor it means to be in want to
[1:09:20] be needy to be chiefly poor amen I think
[1:09:23] that's amazing amen that David uses a
[1:09:25] word that says chiefly poor and then
[1:09:27] Paul writes and says I'm the chief of
[1:09:30] Sinners David goes on to say a person
[1:09:33] who is subject to oppression and abuse
[1:09:36] and is needing help come on church amen
[1:09:40] a deliverance from trouble especially as
[1:09:43] delivered by God this is a general
[1:09:46] reference Amen to the lowest class so if
[1:09:49] you think you're high class this don't
[1:09:51] affect you if you think you're better
[1:09:53] than somebody else this won't affect you
[1:09:55] if you think you got it all figured out
[1:09:57] because some man has come up with a way
[1:10:00] that seems right to walk in then you
[1:10:02] have no need for this sermon but if
[1:10:03] you're like me and the rest of us who
[1:10:05] was the lowest of lows who was the down
[1:10:08] of the Downs who was the broken of the
[1:10:10] broken who was the Lost of the lost but
[1:10:13] God who is rich in Mercy fulfilled his
[1:10:15] word by supplying a bread that would
[1:10:18] feed the hearts of those who was in a
[1:10:20] time of need my brother says in the
[1:10:24] absolute 196 3 he says Lord I pray that
[1:10:27] you'll bless us today as we further go
[1:10:30] into this service he said that you would
[1:10:32] break to us the bread of life which is
[1:10:36] the revelation of Christ my I want to
[1:10:39] stop and Shout for 30 minutes right
[1:10:41] there are you hearing me amen I will
[1:10:43] feed amen her poor I will satisfy her
[1:10:47] poor with bread and a prophet comes
[1:10:49] along and says what is the bread it's
[1:10:52] the revelation
[1:10:55] I will satisfy those who are oppressed
[1:10:58] who are abused listen he didn't say he
[1:11:01] would do it by an emotion he didn't say
[1:11:03] he would do it by feeling he didn't say
[1:11:05] he would do it by gift he didn't say he
[1:11:07] would do it by sensation he said but I
[1:11:09] will provide a bread and that bread will
[1:11:12] be a revelation it will be the staff of
[1:11:15] life it will be the food that will put a
[1:11:17] vitamin power in the hearts of the young
[1:11:19] people that they can stand up on their
[1:11:22] own two feet and say Satan I Know Who
[1:11:24] You Are I'm not following a man I'm
[1:11:27] underneath the original headship and
[1:11:29] everything you know every scheme you've
[1:11:31] got every trick You' playing has been
[1:11:34] exposed by the revelation of Jesus
[1:11:37] Christ in the power of the authority of
[1:11:39] the word listen friends we are promised
[1:11:42] an abundance of Joy well I think it's
[1:11:44] time amen God bless you brother Drew
[1:11:46] forny I think it's time to kick that
[1:11:48] Rousy Rousey wo poor pitiful me devil
[1:11:51] right out of the house of
[1:11:53] God Amen it ain't spirit spiritual to be
[1:11:55] sad it ain't spiritual to be oppressed
[1:11:58] it ain't spiritual to be downtrodden and
[1:12:00] you know what else it ain't it ain't
[1:12:01] spiritual to be formal
[1:12:03] either well glory to God are you hearing
[1:12:06] me we ought to kick that devil out of
[1:12:08] here and remind him who we are we are
[1:12:11] the sons and daughters of Abraham we are
[1:12:13] Abraham's seed and we have Abraham's
[1:12:16] faith and we have a right by the blood
[1:12:19] to walk in the provision that God has
[1:12:23] made we have an abundance of joy we have
[1:12:26] an abundance of Peace we have an
[1:12:28] abundance of life we have an abundance
[1:12:31] of
[1:12:31] Health come on we have an abundance of
[1:12:34] healing we have an abundance but the
[1:12:36] greatest one of them all amen Eli is we
[1:12:38] have an abundance of
[1:12:41] Revelation that means we don't have to
[1:12:43] have one dead church
[1:12:44] service I know people say dead church
[1:12:47] services that churches ain't doing
[1:12:48] certain things but let's just say what a
[1:12:50] prophet said he said the last plague to
[1:12:52] strike Israel was spiritual death he
[1:12:55] said and spiritual death come because
[1:12:56] they lost their ability to discern
[1:12:59] between what was right and what was
[1:13:00] wrong and so when things come in rather
[1:13:02] than feeding on the Revelation that give
[1:13:04] him strength well can I preach amen that
[1:13:07] give him strength to stand up listen now
[1:13:09] amen Devil's coming around and saying
[1:13:11] you know it really don't matter if you
[1:13:12] wear a little makeup it don't matter if
[1:13:14] you paint your nails it don't matter if
[1:13:16] you put a pair of high heel shoes on it
[1:13:18] don't matter if you wear shorts boys
[1:13:20] that was just brother braham's opinion
[1:13:22] well let me say this I refuse to leave
[1:13:24] the the table of the Seven Seals I
[1:13:27] refuse to leave the table where there is
[1:13:29] a bread of his presence by the revealing
[1:13:33] of the son of man I refuse to begin to
[1:13:36] feed on a way that seems right when God
[1:13:39] has spread a
[1:13:41] table it's an abundance of Revelation to
[1:13:44] give you a strength to withstand the
[1:13:46] devil that's coming against you let me
[1:13:48] just say it like this in other words we
[1:13:51] are living in the
[1:13:53] Overflow brother Peter in other words we
[1:13:56] are living in the Overflow now you all
[1:13:59] know amen I hate to ask this but it's
[1:14:01] getting a little cold up here if they
[1:14:02] could turn that up amen there was a
[1:14:03] natural Israel amen but then there was a
[1:14:06] spiritual Israel brother said see as the
[1:14:08] Lord met with natural Israel he is
[1:14:11] meeting with us because they were on a
[1:14:14] journey they were on a journey so they
[1:14:16] were going somewhere but in order to get
[1:14:19] to their destination they must have a
[1:14:22] provision he said now what Israel was in
[1:14:24] the natural is what we are in the
[1:14:27] spiritual he said God is leading Israel
[1:14:31] naturally is what he doing for us
[1:14:34] spiritually
[1:14:35] today the lowest class of people on the
[1:14:39] face of the Earth are being led by the
[1:14:42] highest General that's ever
[1:14:44] been the most rejected class of people
[1:14:47] are being led come on church do you
[1:14:50] realize right now that our world I don't
[1:14:52] want to get in politics but just let me
[1:14:53] preach a second amen our world has
[1:14:55] forgot that a nation that turns against
[1:14:58] Israel is a nation that God will turn
[1:15:00] into the pits of Hell come on now
[1:15:03] because God is with Israel do you
[1:15:04] realize it's been over a year since them
[1:15:07] bunch of devils in invaded Israel and
[1:15:09] slaughtered and massacred and just
[1:15:11] tortured lives amen but today Israel is
[1:15:14] still fighting you mean they've been
[1:15:17] fighting for a whole year come on in
[1:15:19] other words it's been a whole year since
[1:15:21] bethl
[1:15:23] camp in 2020 three and some of you all
[1:15:26] are back here again this year and you
[1:15:28] still got a sword in your hand you still
[1:15:31] got a shield in front of you you still
[1:15:33] got a song in your heart you still got a
[1:15:35] Hallelujah in your voice you still got
[1:15:37] an amen in your soul you know why
[1:15:40] because you're not just church members
[1:15:42] You Are Spiritual Israel and if God can
[1:15:45] take Natural Israel and keep them in a
[1:15:47] battle for a solid year and every
[1:15:50] General that rose up against them they
[1:15:52] have
[1:15:53] slain might as well preach do you
[1:15:56] realize how bad it's getting amen Hamas
[1:15:58] can't even get Generals in fast enough
[1:16:00] before Israel takes them
[1:16:02] out they can't even get somebody
[1:16:04] installed in officially placed before
[1:16:06] Israel takes that leader out and they
[1:16:08] have to go get somebody else oh I feel
[1:16:11] like preaching right there what about
[1:16:12] you young people the devil has got Kings
[1:16:15] of lust he's got Kings of pornography
[1:16:18] he's got Kings of unbelief and kings of
[1:16:20] depression and kings of anxiety and
[1:16:23] every one of them he's put in power Amen
[1:16:25] to try to defeat you you have overcome
[1:16:28] because you're not just following a man
[1:16:31] you're following General Jesus you're
[1:16:33] following the King of Kings and the Lord
[1:16:35] of
[1:16:36] lords well I want to tell that devil God
[1:16:39] is on my side hey God is on my side and
[1:16:43] as long as God is fighting for little
[1:16:45] Israel she will
[1:16:49] prevail a solid
[1:16:51] year and they're still fighting brother
[1:16:54] Donnie a solid year and they're still
[1:16:57] getting up every morning and laying out
[1:16:58] there every
[1:17:00] night I got to move on I'll stay there
[1:17:02] too long you know why because they got a
[1:17:04] promise they got a destination see what
[1:17:07] Moses did in the natural was he led them
[1:17:10] in their journey by a god-given promise
[1:17:12] brother said now they were going to a
[1:17:14] promised land they were coming out of a
[1:17:16] chaos into a Promised Land from the
[1:17:19] ridiculous to the sublime see God had
[1:17:23] chosen Israel same as God has chosen
[1:17:25] Zion to fulfill his promise through
[1:17:29] therefore if he has chose us to be a
[1:17:32] part of the greatest battle that has
[1:17:35] ever been fought then that tells me that
[1:17:37] we are his responsibility fully so in

[1:18:41] from The World God supplies our good
[1:18:44] times so you mean in this battle we're
[1:18:47] going to need something in our journey

[1:18:52] to need a good time so you know what God
[1:18:54] said he said okay I'll give you a good
[1:18:56] time you won't have to go to the bar to
[1:18:58] find
[1:19:00] it you won't have to go to The Honky
[1:19:02] talk to find it you don't have to go to
[1:19:04] a club to find it you don't have to go
[1:19:06] to a joint or some or some or or some
[1:19:09] medically approved drug you don't have
[1:19:12] to go there listen if you'll come under
[1:19:14] my head SHP if you'll allow me to be
[1:19:16] your absolute if you'll walk in the way
[1:19:18] that I've proven to be right then on a
[1:19:20] Friday night I'll let you get your drunk
[1:19:22] on the holy ghost that you forget get
[1:19:24] your name and listen when you get done
[1:19:27] drinking you'll still be able to pick up
[1:19:28] a sword and
[1:19:30] fight well I feel like shouting on that
[1:19:32] one hey you get a man drunk in the
[1:19:34] natural he ain't very capable of picking
[1:19:36] up a sword the next morning because he
[1:19:38] can't discern what his enemy is but if
[1:19:41] you get a man drunk of this new wine
[1:19:43] listen it'll make you fight
[1:19:46] better come on it'll make you fight
[1:19:48] better you know what the part of God
[1:19:49] said he said you'll get so drunk you'll
[1:19:51] love
[1:19:52] everybody you want to fight the devil
[1:19:54] falling over Jesus and fight that Devil
[1:19:56] by loving your brother and loving your
[1:19:58] sister and forgetting who offended you
[1:20:01] and forgetting who let
[1:20:03] you he promised to supply our good times
[1:20:07] he promises to supply our bread he
[1:20:09] supplies everything that we have need of
[1:20:12] listen God Amen has revealed his secrets
[1:20:15] to this age and God has manifested which
[1:20:18] that word manifested is an action his
[1:20:21] word amen God Amen God has manifested
[1:20:25] his word and by manifesting his word he
[1:20:29] has brought a
[1:20:31] provision into existence for the church
[1:20:35] to use now you know in every scripture
[1:20:37] we find brother in scripture we find
[1:20:39] that there are seven compound Redemptive
[1:20:41] names of Jehovah how many knows
[1:20:43] that he says now what he appeared amen
[1:20:46] as God to the human race in the
[1:20:48] beginning so in the beginning he has to
[1:20:51] continue on under those names
[1:20:55] and under that provision so there is a
[1:20:58] connection between the food supply of
[1:21:01] the church and the name of God if he
[1:21:04] didn't then he certainly told something
[1:21:07] that was wrong when he appeared to the
[1:21:09] human race and said that's what he was
[1:21:11] and look what You' make God then just a
[1:21:13] man you would make him a liar he said if
[1:21:16] those Redemptive names did not apply to
[1:21:19] Jesus then he isn't the Savior and if
[1:21:22] all those Redemptive names was in Jesus
[1:21:24] well then he's the same yesterday today
[1:21:28] and forever in your journey you have
[1:21:31] some yesterdays in your journey you have
[1:21:33] some today's but you also have a
[1:21:36] destination or a future listen he's the
[1:21:39] same yesterday today and forever now
[1:21:41] this is what I love brother Ronnie
[1:21:43] there's no way out of
[1:21:46] it testing one two there's no
[1:21:50] way there's no way
[1:21:54] there's no way out oh God there's no way
[1:21:58] out of it they are inseparable if
[1:22:01] Jehovah appeared as Jehovah that will
[1:22:04] provide the sacrifice then he appeared
[1:22:06] as Jehovah that will heal he appeared as
[1:22:08] Jehovah our Banner Jehovah our Shield
[1:22:11] Jehovah our strength Jehovah Our Praise
[1:22:13] all these different names he appeared in
[1:22:16] he has to remain that because he
[1:22:18] introduced himself to the human race
[1:22:21] amen by those names what name name was
[1:22:24] it Jehovah he said now watch God his
[1:22:28] attitude towards the people amen from
[1:22:31] Eden now listen Back to Eden is wrapped
[1:22:35] in the seven Redemptive names what Eve
[1:22:39] turned down would return in the end time
[1:22:43] and there would be a bride who would
[1:22:45] accept
[1:22:46] it and there's no way out of it can I
[1:22:50] just say it like a prophet said it he
[1:22:52] said there I was out there the other day
[1:22:54] in the those in those in those squirrel
[1:22:56] woods and I was out there hunting he
[1:22:58] said and all of a sudden the Revelation
[1:23:00] came it's in the message of Grace if you
[1:23:02] want to hear the whole testimony he said
[1:23:03] all of a sudden the Revelation came and
[1:23:06] here it is the Jehovah of the
[1:23:09] old is the Jesus of the new so a
[1:23:14] revelation what is
[1:23:16] bread it's Revelation so a bread of his
[1:23:20] presence came to a prophet who recorded
[1:23:23] on books and TBL
[1:23:24] and send it out to the bride who is
[1:23:27] spiritual Israel which is a type of Zion
[1:23:30] because it would be more than just a
[1:23:32] word in 1961 but it would be a food to
[1:23:36] feed on in 2024 in the middle of the
[1:23:39] Youth
[1:23:41] Camp you say brother Andrew Jehovah amen
[1:23:44] yes the one we know so well amen is
[1:23:46] Jehovah Gyra right amen now let me just
[1:23:49] say something to you I'm not going to
[1:23:50] read it to you I'm going to preach it
[1:23:51] amen Jehovah Gyra appeared to Abraham
[1:23:54] right right now do you all know that
[1:23:55] Abraham took his son Isaac who he had
[1:23:58] waited for young people he had waited
[1:24:00] brother brother John Moses he had waited
[1:24:02] for years for this child to come into
[1:24:04] existence amen and one day he's told by
[1:24:07] the Lord Tanner he says take Isaac up on
[1:24:10] the mountain and offer him as a
[1:24:12] sacrifice now there's something that
[1:24:13] stands out to me is when Isaac and
[1:24:16] Abraham when they took off walking
[1:24:18] Abraham looks over oh God he looks over
[1:24:21] at him and he says I and the lad will go
[1:24:23] Yonder worship and I and the lad will
[1:24:27] return okay but I but Abraham you're
[1:24:30] going up there Amen to slay Isaac so you
[1:24:34] will return but Isaac won't but see
[1:24:37] Abraham had a revelation that somewhere
[1:24:40] oh god brother Jason I got to thinking
[1:24:42] about this other day amen somewhere
[1:24:44] between the time Abraham and Isaac left
[1:24:46] Abraham had this revelation God is going
[1:24:49] to provide something between here and
[1:24:52] there so I can bring my son back
[1:24:57] here somewhere from the beginning to the
[1:25:01] ending God somewhere from the alpha to
[1:25:04] the Omega somewhere something is going
[1:25:07] to come into existence and it's going to
[1:25:09] be a provision and it's going to allow
[1:25:12] me to bring my son back he didn't know
[1:25:14] if it was going to be a resurrection he
[1:25:16] didn't know if he got up on that
[1:25:18] mountain there would be another child
[1:25:19] laying there but there was a revelation
[1:25:21] in his heart because he had been feeding
[1:25:24] on a bread as a part of the Israelite
[1:25:26] race oh church and said my God will
[1:25:29] provide something between here and there
[1:25:32] and my and my son will return so they
[1:25:35] both went together and it came to PL
[1:25:37] pass when they got to the place which
[1:25:39] God told him of that Abraham built an
[1:25:41] altar there and he laid the wood in
[1:25:43] order and bound Isaac his son and laid
[1:25:46] him on the Altar and Abraham stretched
[1:25:48] for his hand and took the knife to slay
[1:25:51] his son and the angel of the Lord come
[1:25:53] on in the room Lord he called unto him
[1:25:56] out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham
[1:25:59] he said here am I he said lay not thy
[1:26:02] hand upon thy lad neither do thou
[1:26:05] anything unto him for now I
[1:26:09] know for now I know that thou fearest
[1:26:13] God seeing thou Hast not withheld thine
[1:26:16] only son can I just say something to you
[1:26:18] young people God was not looking for
[1:26:21] Isaac he was looking for Abraham's
[1:26:23] obedience to what he would
[1:26:26] provide come on church he was looking
[1:26:30] amen for Abraham to believe that what he
[1:26:32] would provide in the stad of his son
[1:26:35] would be sufficient to fulfill the
[1:26:37] prophecy that I and the lad will go
[1:26:39] Yonder and worship and I am the lad will
[1:26:41] return brother said see what obedience
[1:26:44] is it's what God wants you realize what
[1:26:46] obedience does it produces more than we
[1:26:49] realize he said see look Abraham called
[1:26:51] the name amen the place of Jehovah Gyra
[1:26:55] now let me just ask you something okay
[1:26:57] Abraham is up on top of the mountain
[1:26:59] there's no water there there's no food
[1:27:01] supply and all of a sudden he looks over
[1:27:04] and there's a
[1:27:07] ram can I ask you a question how could a
[1:27:11] ram get up there when there was nothing
[1:27:13] to grow one up there there was no water
[1:27:16] for it to live up there listen what the
[1:27:18] prophet says he said the text explains
[1:27:21] it he's Jehovah Gyra he spoke the ram
[1:27:24] into existence that's the reason Abraham
[1:27:26] called the place of the name Jehovah
[1:27:28] Gyra because if God has made a promise
[1:27:31] then God can provide the thing for that
[1:27:34] promise when God makes you a promise he
[1:27:37] doesn't leave anything up to you Amen to
[1:27:39] fulfill to bring that promise to pass
[1:27:42] when I say that what I mean is if he
[1:27:44] says I am the lad will go Yonder and
[1:27:46] worship and I am the lad will return
[1:27:48] then God will not get you up there and
[1:27:51] make you work something up or make you
[1:27:52] try to fast something up or try to beat
[1:27:55] something out of the altar he will
[1:27:56] provide something by the authority of
[1:27:59] his spoken word listen the only thing
[1:28:01] you have to do is accept what he
[1:28:07] provides oh I'm trying to behave God is
[1:28:10] able this morning to send in our midst
[1:28:12] the Holy Ghost he's able to send the
[1:28:14] power to heal the sick to save the lost
[1:28:17] to do anything that he has spoken of
[1:28:19] listen he is a true Messenger from God
[1:28:22] if he is he believes that God is able
[1:28:25] these stones to rise children unto
[1:28:27] Abraham he said he holds on to that
[1:28:30] listen Jehovah Gyra God will provide
[1:28:33] how's it going to happen brother Brandon
[1:28:35] I don't
[1:28:37] know there was a man of God stood here
[1:28:39] behind this pull pit last night and said
[1:28:41] God was going to deliver some of
[1:28:43] you are you hearing me now listen it was
[1:28:46] more than just a sermon it was a burden
[1:28:48] on his heart to stand here and say the
[1:28:51] spirit of the Lord spoke to my heart and
[1:28:53] said to deal with that right brother
[1:28:54] Donnie to deal with that spirit of
[1:28:55] suicide listen brother Donnie didn't
[1:28:58] come here knowing who had it he didn't
[1:28:59] come here knowing amen who had it how
[1:29:01] they was going to lose it but he came
[1:29:03] here as a man of God under an authority
[1:29:06] by the bread that he's been feeding on
[1:29:08] as the revelation of Jesus Christ and he
[1:29:10] stood behind that pull pit and he held
[1:29:12] the Word of Deliverance up to you listen
[1:29:14] friends I don't know how God does it but
[1:29:17] I just raised my hands and say Lord I've
[1:29:19] seen you do it too many times to believe
[1:29:22] you're still not able to do it again
[1:29:24] I've seen him save I've seen him heal
[1:29:27] brother the end I've seen him give the
[1:29:28] Holy Ghost I've seen him take lives that
[1:29:30] were shipwrecks and transform them by
[1:29:33] the renewing of their mind and the power
[1:29:35] of transformation oh let me say it with
[1:29:38] everything within me if he did it before
[1:29:40] he can do it again if he saved before he
[1:29:43] can save
[1:29:46] again Hallelujah I'm not a crazy man I
[1:29:49] am a Seed of Abraham who believes my God
[1:29:52] is still Jehovah

[1:30:59] don't know how he's going to bring you

[1:44:28] ago amen a bread of this presence to
[1:44:30] feed
[1:44:32] on and when you start eating on this
[1:44:35] food you start looking for the
[1:44:41] devil my Bible says you have a
[1:44:45] boldness to enter into the
[1:44:51] Holy by the blood of Jesus Jesus not an
[1:44:54] old way but a new and the living way but
[1:44:57] said that was the dead way in order of
[1:44:59] law but
[1:45:01] now we enter by
[1:45:05] grace through the holy spirit it's not
[1:45:10] what you do it's what he does for us by
[1:45:13] Grace we just accept it
[1:45:23] brother digs picked it up this morning
[1:45:24] I'm going to pick it up
[1:45:26] tonight flood relief is
[1:45:31] here it's
[1:45:33] here it's
[1:45:36] here Christ takes away the sin we
[1:45:40] believe it hear the gospel believe it
[1:45:42] accept it then if we truly accept it
[1:45:45] from the depths of our heart God gives
[1:45:48] us the Holy Ghost as a witness I brother
[1:45:50] sister I don't want you to think I'm a
[1:45:51] Fuster at other churches and trying to
[1:45:53] put that Pat this church what I'm trying
[1:45:55] to do is get the
[1:45:58] carnality out of the
[1:46:00] church he said the churches when they
[1:46:02] organize their churches the things they
[1:46:04] do they block the blessings of God by
[1:46:05] their theology that God cannot break
[1:46:07] through to bless his people they get
[1:46:09] their church so formal and so stiff and
[1:46:11] so starchy till the Holy Spirit can't
[1:46:14] even come into the church and then when
[1:46:16] the devil seen he had that made and some
[1:46:19] was going to break through anyhow then
[1:46:21] he let them open other channels that was
[1:46:22] was at the gospel and run them off in
[1:46:25] fanaticism they either get to a bunch of
[1:46:27] Fanatics or a bunch of starches but in
[1:46:29] the middle of the road brother Jason
[1:46:32] Bears the gospel of the Lord Jesus
[1:46:35] Christ can I go ahead and say it the
[1:46:37] gospel is not a
[1:46:41] Frolic and neither is it a funeral
[1:46:44] procession but a prophet of
[1:46:47] God's a prophet of God said it's a feast
[1:46:53] it's
[1:46:54] a it's a so what do you do at a
[1:46:58] feast you Feast at a feast you feast and
[1:47:05] you get
[1:47:07] full my God shall supply all of your
[1:47:10] needs he shall liberally fill until
[1:47:13] you're
[1:47:16] full come on Church you know what I can
[1:47:19] I have a liberty here you know what I'm
[1:47:21] talking about amen you come to church
[1:47:23] and you come in on Wednesday night or
[1:47:24] Sunday morning and you get in there and
[1:47:26] even maybe here in this Camp you come in
[1:47:28] and sit down and the world's on your
[1:47:29] shoulders in this problem in this
[1:47:30] situation and she didn't look at you and
[1:47:32] he didn't like
[1:47:33] it it's Youth Camp come
[1:47:36] on are you hearing me well I thought I
[1:47:38] was a part of this click and I thought I
[1:47:40] he you come in here with all that on
[1:47:43] you and really what you're in is you are
[1:47:47] in a
[1:47:48] prison you're in a flood as you heard
[1:47:51] last night you're over loaded as you
[1:47:53] heard this
[1:47:55] morning what you need is a way
[1:48:00] out what you need is a way out brother
[1:48:03] said look he said see the old pasal lamb
[1:48:06] passed away he said and today they've
[1:48:08] crucified the word he said but look
[1:48:11] that's just been recently they've
[1:48:13] accepted a Creed in the stead of the
[1:48:16] word he said that's the day the word
[1:48:19] come into full effect that's just been
[1:48:22] read recently he said see and now if the
[1:48:24] churches would forget their Creeds
[1:48:26] forget their dogmas and just take the
[1:48:29] Bible and plead the promise then the
[1:48:32] promise would become effective to them
[1:48:34] see well that's the same thing with your
[1:48:36] Traditions they make the word of God un
[1:48:38] effect he said the spiritual bride of
[1:48:40] today the so-called Church she takes the
[1:48:43] word of God but she won't accept
[1:48:47] it so she takes it but she won't accept
[1:48:51] it no she accepts dogmas of it
[1:48:54] instead so the words not effective to
[1:48:58] her so in other words she don't realize
[1:49:02] the prophet of God said it's already
[1:49:05] provided for you to accept now can I
[1:49:08] just say something to you barema sat in
[1:49:11] a
[1:49:12] prison okay they were offering Pascal
[1:49:15] Lambs down at the
[1:49:17] temple but brother Donnie up on a cross
[1:49:21] there was the Lamb of God who was dying
[1:49:23] for the sins of the world brother Diggs
[1:49:27] they were down there in the temple
[1:49:29] underneath the law offering a sacrifice
[1:49:33] killing a lamb when Jesus hung on the
[1:49:36] cross and cried it is finished the very
[1:49:40] minute he spoke those words it is
[1:49:43] finished this become of none
[1:49:49] effect so to stay there you went out the
[1:49:52] same way you come in because now The
[1:49:55] Mercy Seat has changed from here to
[1:49:59] there but let me tell you something the
[1:50:02] only way you can see that there is you
[1:50:04] got to lift up your
[1:50:08] head you got to lift up your head from
[1:50:12] looking down at where he has been and
[1:50:14] start looking up to where he
[1:50:17] is are you hearing me in other words if
[1:50:20] you're in a valley if you're going to
[1:50:22] see the top of the mountain you got to
[1:50:24] look up brother said see what is this
[1:50:26] bride she is a special designation of
[1:50:30] himself he's the creator of that church
[1:50:33] he created the bride his own bride in
[1:50:35] other words this bride has been
[1:50:38] predestinated and designed by
[1:50:40] predestination to be accepted in the
[1:50:43] Beloved let me let me I'm I'm going to
[1:50:45] I'm going to give you a loaf of bread
[1:50:46] and we're going to go home okay or or
[1:50:49] wherever having predestinated us unto
[1:50:52] the adoption of children by not a loaf
[1:50:55] by Jesus Christ himself according to the
[1:50:58] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[1:51:00] to the glory of his grace wherein he
[1:51:03] hath made us accepted in the Beloved
[1:51:07] look at this word accepted to be highly
[1:51:09] favored to pursue with Grace brother B
[1:51:14] said then just by accepting it won't

[1:51:18] back that he has accepted you see you

[1:57:32] had more Revelation than
[1:57:39] mistakes he had more Revelation than
[1:57:42] mistakes some of you all have left the
[1:57:45] devil silence your voice when it comes
[1:57:47] to quoting the promises of God because
[1:57:49] you made this mistake and you made this
[1:57:51] failure and you have this blund and this
[1:57:54] is in your history and this is in your
[1:57:56] past well I want to tell that devil this
[1:57:58] is a church full of a bunch of Simon
[1:58:01] Peters we got mistakes we got failures
[1:58:04] we got shortcomings but we got more
[1:58:07] Revelation and we got mistakes we got
[1:58:10] more Revelation the full word has been
[1:58:13] delivered to this age and we fed on
[1:58:19] it hallelujah hallelujah
[1:58:22] I accept the
[1:58:24] Revelation I accept
[1:58:26] [Applause]
[1:58:31] it because
[1:58:34] Revelation
[1:58:36] Revelation I got here too late
[1:58:39] Revelation brings
[1:58:43] hope as our musicians are coming
[1:58:47] tonight y'all remember Joshua and Israel
[1:58:51] you know the Bible says that God as
[1:58:53] we've already said God was on their side
[1:58:55] right they were a promised people of
[1:59:00] Victory brother sister they were never
[1:59:03] supposed to go into one
[1:59:05] battle and walk out
[1:59:08] defeated every battle they went into
[1:59:12] because of who they
[1:59:14] were and
[1:59:15] whose they
[1:59:17] were they were to carry out the
[1:59:20] victory so one day
[1:59:22] they go fight that great old big Battle
[1:59:24] of
[1:59:25] Jericho brother one probably the biggest
[1:59:27] battles and they win it I mean man they
[1:59:31] went to
[1:59:32] bethl
[1:59:34] 2023 and they fought that devil they got
[1:59:38] the victory they fought that devil and
[1:59:41] prayed through and the Holy Ghost
[1:59:43] come and then they went to another
[1:59:45] battle like Israel who went to the
[1:59:46] Battle of AI and though it's not
[1:59:48] artificial
[1:59:50] intelligence they went to the battle of
[1:59:52] AI right after the biggest battle of
[1:59:54] their history Jericho and lost
[1:59:59] it they went from the biggest
[2:00:03] battle to one of the smallest battles
[2:00:06] and lose
[2:00:07] it and Joshua said well I guess that's
[2:00:10] just you know I guess that's just the
[2:00:11] way it is I mean I guess we just accept
[2:00:13] defeat I guess we just see what next
[2:00:15] battle holds I guess we'll just keep on
[2:00:17] floating along till something changes
[2:00:19] Joshua said hold it a second he said
[2:00:22] listen there's something wrong somewhere
[2:00:25] you know what he did he fell on his face
[2:00:27] and began to pray in Joshua 710 the Lord
[2:00:30] said un Joshua get thee up wherefore
[2:00:32] thou has line upon thy face Israel has
[2:00:35] sinned and they have also transgressed
[2:00:37] my Covenant which I command them for
[2:00:39] they have even taken the accursed thing
[2:00:41] and have also stolen and disassembled
[2:00:43] also and they have put it oh
[2:00:46] [Music]
[2:00:47] God let me just say it like this aens
[2:00:50] who he's talking about and they brought
[2:00:52] a golden wedge into the tent and put it
[2:00:55] even among their own
[2:00:57] stuff so televisions come back in homes
[2:01:03] and I know it's not popular no more but
[2:01:05] it's still in the message so let's just
[2:01:06] let's just preach the bread okay
[2:01:09] therefore the children of Israel could
[2:01:10] not stand before their enemies but they
[2:01:12] turned their back before the enemies and
[2:01:14] they were accursed but Joshua hears the
[2:01:17] Lord sanctify yourselves sanctify the
[2:01:19] people for thus say the Lord of God if
[2:01:21] Israel there there is a cursed thing in
[2:01:22] the midst of thee oh Israel thou can't
[2:01:24] stand before thy enemies until you take
[2:01:27] away the cursed things from among you so
[2:01:29] brother Jason Joshua figures out it was
[2:01:31] the golden wedge in the camp that was in
[2:01:34] the home of aen you know what he done
[2:01:36] they went down there and they burned
[2:01:39] Aken they burned his family they took
[2:01:42] the burned Ashes to the valley and
[2:01:46] spread them and upon and spread the
[2:01:49] ashes and covered up with the Rocks then
[2:01:52] they went back to the battle and was
[2:01:53] Victorious now will you go with Joshua 7
[2:01:56] to the book of Hosea with me there's a
[2:01:58] story of redemption and it's Hosea a
[2:02:00] prophet asking the Lord Lord with all of
[2:02:04] Israel's mistakes and with how they
[2:02:06] backslid and things they've got involved
[2:02:08] in and things they've done things
[2:02:09] they've done all that how can you still
[2:02:12] love Israel can I can I just break this
[2:02:15] down in simple other word terms for you
[2:02:17] in other words Hosea you go marry
[2:02:19] yourself a harlot and you have kids by
[2:02:22] her and then you'll understand how that
[2:02:24] I cannot turn my back on my own seed and
[2:02:28] you'll understand why with Israel and
[2:02:30] all of her mistakes I cannot throw her
[2:02:35] away Israel goes back into her whoredom
[2:02:38] and her all the problems but in Hosea
[2:02:40] chapter 2 and verse1 14 I want to read
[2:02:43] this to you therefore behold look what
[2:02:45] he says I will Allure her and I will
[2:02:50] bring her in the wilderness and I will
[2:02:52] speak comfortably unto her who's her can
[2:02:56] I say that you look at this word Lord it
[2:02:58] means to attract it means to be open oh
[2:03:02] God so brother Ronnie he will open
[2:03:05] something and what he opens will get
[2:03:07] their attention and it will Allure her
[2:03:10] to the valley oh god brother said look
[2:03:14] Christ vindicates his word the word of
[2:03:16] God attracts the bride of Christ so he
[2:03:19] will Allure her verse 15 and I will give
[2:03:21] her Vineyards from fence and the valley
[2:03:24] of acor for a door of
[2:03:31] hope so you've been in the flood waters

[2:03:54] in the days when she came up out of the
[2:03:57] land of Egypt listen in other words what
[2:04:00] happens is God said I love Israel enough
[2:04:03] I will give her a place to deal with her
[2:04:06] sin and I will cover it or I will hide
[2:04:09] it and I will bring her back to Victory
