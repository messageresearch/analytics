[46:07] request if you're online you have a
[46:09] request get it to me directly by
[46:12] whatsapp that's the first place i'll
[46:13] look and a lot of times i'll get back to
[46:16] my office and realize somebody tried to
[46:18] sneak one in under the finish line and i
[46:19] missed it so we don't want to miss it
[46:21] i'd like to get it so if you have a
[46:23] request just send it to me
[46:26] personally and i'll get that amen praise
[46:28] the lord in saint john 6 we want to
[46:32] continue tonight and i i i didn't really
[46:35] think this morning
[46:37] a little ways after 8 a.m
[46:40] that this sermon would connect to my
[46:42] series on the coming of the lord
[46:45] but uh you know it just it broke open to
[46:48] me so beautifully
[46:50] and as i studied it throughout the day
[46:52] particularly in the afternoon i realized
[46:54] my goodness it exactly fits and so
[46:57] the lord uh knew amen i was telling
[47:00] sister debbie i wasn't scheduled to
[47:01] preach tonight but i sure wanted to
[47:04] and uh so the lord made a way for that
[47:06] so we're happy
[47:08] amen i want to take a subtitle tonight
[47:11] as i announce to you um on the
[47:13] church-wide chat from bitterness to
[47:16] sweetness

[47:34] verily verily i say unto you he that
[47:36] believeth on me hath everlasting life
[47:40] i am that bread of life that's a pretty
[47:42] bold statement isn't it your fathers did
[47:44] eat manna in the wilderness and are dead
[47:47] this is the bread which cometh down
[47:51] from heaven that a man may eat thereof
[47:54] and not die
[47:56] i am the living bread which came down
[47:58] from heaven
[48:00] so what do you do with bread it's not a
[48:02] a
[48:03] a wall ornament
[48:05] it's not a shelf decoration bread is for
[48:07] consuming
[48:08] amen that's right off the bat bread is
[48:11] for consuming you need to eat it that's
[48:13] that's the reason you have it all right
[48:16] and i am the living bread verse 51 again
[48:18] that the living bread which came down
[48:21] from heaven verse 51 if any man
[48:24] eat of this bread he shall live forever
[48:28] and the bread that i will give is my
[48:30] flesh
[48:31] which i will give for the life of the
[48:33] world in that beautiful
[48:37] the jews therefore strove among
[48:39] themselves saying
[48:41] how can this man
[48:42] give us his flesh to eat
[48:45] then jesus said unto them
[48:47] verily verily i say unto you
[48:50] except ye eat the flesh of the son of
[48:52] man and drink his blood you have no life
[48:56] in you
[48:57] whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[49:00] blood hath eternal life and i will raise
[49:04] him up at the last day
[49:06] for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood
[49:10] is drink indeed
[49:12] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[49:15] blood
[49:16] dwelleth in me and i in him
[49:20] catch that now read 56 again
[49:23] he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[49:26] blood
[49:27] dwelleth in me
[49:28] and i in him
[49:31] as the living father what kind of father
[49:34] as the living father hath sent me
[49:38] and i live by the father
[49:42] so he that eateth me
[49:44] even he shall live by me
[49:48] this is that bread which came down from
[49:51] heaven not as your fathers did eat manna
[49:54] and are dead he that eateth of this
[49:57] bread
[49:58] shall live forever
[50:01] amen
[50:02] let's pray father we thank you for your
[50:04] word now
[50:05] and i commit the reading of it and the
[50:07] hearing of it into your hands
[50:10] lord
[50:11] let me have the path of anointing that i
[50:13] can deliver this thought lord i am sure
[50:17] that it it came upon me early this
[50:19] morning as if it just fell out of the
[50:22] heavens lord and i
[50:23] just
[50:24] just uh from my morning bible study
[50:27] listening lord and sitting and other
[50:29] ministers and commentary and different
[50:31] things that were going and suddenly
[50:33] something struck me and i raced to the
[50:36] bible and quickly i read it and i said
[50:38] my goodness
[50:39] how have i looked at that in reverse my
[50:41] whole life lord and so i
[50:43] i'm just thanking you for it today and i
[50:45] pray that you will let it be a benefit
[50:48] to every hearer now we commit it to you
[50:51] in jesus name amen god bless you friends
[50:54] you can be seated
[50:58] brother caleb if you will give me
[51:01] please
[51:02] from the book of revelation
[51:05] and the 14th chapter
[51:07] i want to catch one verse which will be
[51:10] the eighth verse revelation
[51:13] 14
[51:14] and 8.
[51:15] now i want you to notice the scripture
[51:17] and it will become important as i go
[51:19] along
[51:20] and there followed another angel
[51:23] saying
[51:24] babylon is fallen is fallen
[51:28] that great city
[51:29] because she made all nations drink of
[51:33] the wine of the wrath
[51:36] of her fornication it's an amazing
[51:39] amazing statement that you're going to
[51:41] understand as we get going in it i'm
[51:44] going to read it for you again and there
[51:45] followed another angel saying
[51:48] babylon has fallen is fallen
[51:51] that great city because she hath made
[51:54] all nations drink of the wine of her
[51:57] fornication
[51:59] now we've been
[52:01] breaking down
[52:03] revelation the 10th chapter quite a bit
[52:06] in this little series on the coming of
[52:08] the lord and i have said and say again
[52:12] how much i have personally enjoyed it
[52:14] and and gleaned from it myself it's been
[52:18] quite a delicious meal for me full seven
[52:21] course meal kind of like
[52:23] in case y'all can't tell i like food
[52:25] amen praise the lord and and i love the
[52:29] spiritual food that we have gleaned out
[52:32] of that 10th chapter and
[52:34] we've been breaking down the importance
[52:37] of what god did
[52:38] in that chapter
[52:40] as it relates to you and i today because
[52:44] had it had it not been for the
[52:46] restoration of that word there would
[52:48] have we would have we would have
[52:50] remained a church that could not go in
[52:53] the rapture
[52:55] and that's where brother branham said
[52:56] that was the conundrum that was the
[52:58] problem that that the church
[53:01] could not go in the rapture in the
[53:04] condition that it was in and since the
[53:07] last age had dismissed jesus from their
[53:10] assembly and gave him the boot and
[53:12] kicked him out and he stood outside
[53:15] first the only gener the only age to do
[53:18] that
[53:18] then because that they kicked him out of
[53:21] the church then they couldn't get any
[53:23] better they couldn't improve so when you
[53:25] already are in a state where you can't
[53:28] go in a rapture that's bad enough
[53:31] but as if that's not bad enough they
[53:33] can't get any better so you're hopeless
[53:35] you're not you're not just helpless at
[53:38] that point you are without any hope
[53:41] and so when god came that mighty angel
[53:44] descended this ought to bring us to our
[53:48] feet rejoicing this ought to
[53:51] thrill us to say my i couldn't make it
[53:54] no one could make it but now i can make
[53:57] it because one came down and and we've
[54:00] showed you the necessity of that verse
[54:03] seven that seventh angel messenger and
[54:06] we showed you but then now of course
[54:08] we've also shown you
[54:10] uh with great care that that there is
[54:13] far more
[54:15] written about the bride eating the book
[54:18] and prophesying than than there is
[54:21] written about the seventh messenger the
[54:22] seventh messenger occupies a single
[54:25] verse
[54:26] amen
[54:27] but you you occupy verse eight verse
[54:30] nine verse ten verse eleven
[54:34] you understand and so so now we have the
[54:37] ministry of the son of man again in a
[54:41] many-membered bride we literally we have
[54:44] that ministry now the there's a
[54:45] difference as we've taught you many
[54:47] times there's a vast difference between
[54:49] the office of son of man and the
[54:51] ministry of son of man the office of son
[54:53] of man is a prophet the ministry of the
[54:57] son of man is the word made flesh
[55:00] amen and therefore now that we have
[55:03] taken the book and eaten the book
[55:06] then we now are in possession of and we
[55:09] are operating i don't care how you feel
[55:11] about you
[55:12] how discouraged you might be with you
[55:15] according to god's scripture we are now
[55:18] fulfilling the ministry of the son of
[55:22] man
[55:23] say well but don't we need a prophet we
[55:25] we we we had a prophet who who completed
[55:28] his assignment and the bible tells us
[55:31] that the testimony of jesus christ
[55:34] is the spirit of prophecy so because now
[55:37] you have the full word you are you are
[55:40] singularly have the full testimony of
[55:43] jesus christ therefore the spirit of
[55:46] prophecy is on you amen
[55:50] now this is exactly why we have went
[55:53] down and we have shown you that it can't
[55:56] just be a metaphor it can't just be a
[55:58] cliche it can't just be
[56:00] doctrine it has to translate into a life
[56:03] it has to become material there was no
[56:07] writing on the white stone when brother
[56:10] branham pulled the lid off of that
[56:13] pyramid rock there was white stone on
[56:16] which there was no writing and of course
[56:18] there wouldn't be any writing because
[56:20] this mystery was going to be written not
[56:23] on paper but behind skin
[56:26] it was going to be you the living word
[56:29] made flesh amen
[56:30] because the because we realize that that
[56:33] though that the word as a prophet taught
[56:36] us the word interpreted is a revelation
[56:39] of the name of god and it was in the
[56:42] white stone that he said i'll write a
[56:44] new name
[56:45] and and i'm here to tell you something
[56:47] friends you're it mrs jesus christ amen
[56:52] so it must become a lived life
[56:55] and the problem that too many people
[56:57] face is they go years sitting in a
[56:59] message church without the message in
[57:01] them
[57:02] amen
[57:03] and doesn't do you won't do you any more
[57:05] good to sit in a church that won't make
[57:08] you a christian as oh as old mays
[57:10] jackson used to say won't make you a
[57:12] christian any more than sitting in a
[57:13] garage i'll make you an automobile
[57:16] you've got to be born again you've got
[57:18] to have an experience and you
[57:21] lucky you fortunate you elected you
[57:23] chosen you you have arrived at the age
[57:27] when it's no longer just a dip of the
[57:29] holy spirit but it's the holy ghost
[57:31] himself
[57:32] the full token restored the full
[57:34] abstract the jubilee has been returned
[57:37] to us
[57:38] the book has been unsealed
[57:41] so it must become a living life
[57:44] and
[57:45] and i'm gonna take a photo of it tonight
[57:47] that i haven't i haven't hit you this is
[57:50] why
[57:50] it shocked me when i realized this is
[57:52] actually part of my series because i
[57:56] realized i've talked about our
[57:58] lifestyles and being the living word and
[58:00] how it ought to affect us and and how it
[58:02] ought to be a guide to our life but
[58:05] there's another element that i want to
[58:06] get to tonight that we haven't talked
[58:08] about yet that is also a very necessary
[58:11] element in identifying god's family in
[58:15] the earth
[58:18] amen see
[58:19] that is a family who will overcome
[58:23] every trial
[58:25] every affliction every persecution every
[58:28] separation every kind of conflict the
[58:32] true bride of jesus christ is just as
[58:35] much predestinated to go into trials and
[58:38] tribulations as she was to receive the
[58:41] engrafted word and get a body change
[58:44] amen
[58:45] amen
[58:47] so we've been breaking down then verse 1
[58:50] of chapter 11 showing
[58:53] you know where he says there was given
[58:54] me a reed like and unto a rod and i'm
[58:56] going to watch my time very closely
[58:59] and there was given me a reed like unto
[59:01] a rod and the angel stood saying rise
[59:04] and measure the temple of god
[59:07] and the altar and them that worship
[59:09] therein
[59:10] so
[59:11] what's being measured now is the place
[59:14] of true worship
[59:16] and there's only one place in true
[59:18] worship for with true worship that and
[59:20] it's the same place with true fellowship
[59:23] it's the same place where the living
[59:25] blood is amen and so there's only by
[59:28] blood do we have redemption there's only
[59:30] fellowship through redemption
[59:33] amen
[59:34] and there's only true worship in
[59:36] redemption
[59:37] and the bible teaches us that many
[59:40] will rise and jesus spoke of it that
[59:44] many will worship him
[59:46] and and but yet it won't count
[59:50] and they won't get any credit for it
[59:52] because it's not a complete worship it's
[59:55] a it's a partial worship having rejected
[59:58] the fullness of who he is i mean how do
[1:00:00] you cl how would you worship up
[1:00:04] something that you don't even receive as
[1:00:07] true
[1:00:08] amen
[1:00:09] amen of course your worship would be
[1:00:11] artificial
[1:00:13] if you're rejecting him as as any part
[1:00:15] of him as that you don't believe that
[1:00:17] and you don't think it's true and it's
[1:00:19] not valid then what do you think of him
[1:00:23] then how do you claim you're worshiping
[1:00:25] him but denying the reality of who he is
[1:00:28] and the things he taught in his word
[1:00:30] that i mean a child would understand
[1:00:32] that doesn't compute
[1:00:34] see
[1:00:35] and so the only way that true worship is
[1:00:38] received
[1:00:39] is in spirit
[1:00:41] and in truth
[1:00:43] it wouldn't matter where the church was
[1:00:45] it wouldn't matter what nation you lived
[1:00:47] in there that it used to matter
[1:00:50] it used to be at a temple in a certain
[1:00:52] city and they couldn't go anywhere else
[1:00:54] and and that was the sin you know of of
[1:00:57] dan and and of the sin of jeroboam when
[1:01:00] he put altars in and dan and and ephraim
[1:01:03] and the people worship said oh
[1:01:05] jerusalem's too far the journey but i'm
[1:01:07] here to tell you something friends the
[1:01:08] journey to heaven is never designed to
[1:01:11] be an easy journey it ought to cost us
[1:01:14] something it ought to require an
[1:01:17] investment of our life in it
[1:01:20] it if you gained it with the precious
[1:01:22] blood of the most precious person to
[1:01:25] ever live this gospel is not a cheap
[1:01:27] gospel
[1:01:29] that's why we preach it that's why we
[1:01:30] won't compromise because it's not a
[1:01:33] cheap gospel it costs the blood of
[1:01:35] millions of martyrs it costs the blood
[1:01:37] of christ it costs the blood all the way
[1:01:40] down of saints of god and i'm here to
[1:01:42] tell you today i defend it
[1:01:45] i stand for it
[1:01:47] i strongly and admonish you and and i
[1:01:51] remind you of the scripture when you
[1:01:53] don't want to obey the word i remind you
[1:01:55] the scripture says obey them that have
[1:01:57] the word over you
[1:01:59] that have rulership of the word over you
[1:02:01] they they're not here to hurt you
[1:02:03] they're here for your soul
[1:02:07] amen
[1:02:08] so i know sometimes you want the
[1:02:10] preacher to leave you alone he can't
[1:02:13] amen that's right because the fire of
[1:02:16] god burns in him and god won't leave him
[1:02:18] alone
[1:02:21] so we have to pass the fire
[1:02:25] amen
[1:02:26] amen
[1:02:30] all right now
[1:02:35] so we found then
[1:02:38] that the bride of the last day this is
[1:02:40] the last thing we see of her
[1:02:43] we've shown you how that revelation 11 1
[1:02:45] validates the 10th chapter it validates
[1:02:48] the mighty angel it validates the
[1:02:50] earthly strong angel it validates the
[1:02:53] bride's action it validates the message
[1:02:55] was true this first verse validates it
[1:02:58] because literally we see that the bride
[1:03:01] has become the measurable perfection
[1:03:04] reflecting the image of christ and so
[1:03:07] we're coming then to a place
[1:03:09] uh where we have we have now when you
[1:03:12] read this you realize that the bride is
[1:03:14] now ready for her body change she's
[1:03:17] become the living tabernacle of the
[1:03:19] living god's presence in the earth
[1:03:23] in the earth i'm not going getting to
[1:03:26] heaven before i demonstrate the visible
[1:03:29] perfection of the word of god i'm here
[1:03:31] to make a voice in the earth
[1:03:34] amen and so having reached this
[1:03:37] this position then of course the the
[1:03:40] pyramid is capped the bright tree has
[1:03:42] come back to full bloom with fruit
[1:03:45] growing in the top of the tree seed has
[1:03:48] come back to seed completing the harvest
[1:03:50] cycle the saints of the uh
[1:03:53] of the church ages for 2 000 years are
[1:03:56] raised from the dead
[1:03:58] and we receive glorified bodies with
[1:04:01] them like un unto his glorified body
[1:04:06] revelation 11 1 now here's something
[1:04:08] that i want you to catch and i'm going
[1:04:10] to start to really angle into my thought
[1:04:12] tonight
[1:04:13] revelation 11 1 is preceded
[1:04:17] by
[1:04:18] the necessity of eating the book in
[1:04:22] revelation 10 8. yes amen you're never
[1:04:25] going to fulfill revelation 11 1 if
[1:04:28] you're refusing to eat the book of
[1:04:30] revelation 10 8.
[1:04:32] and then when we eat the book in so
[1:04:34] doing we become the book because the
[1:04:37] book is the lamb's book it's the lamb's
[1:04:40] book of life the book is christ the
[1:04:43] revealed word and we found out that the
[1:04:46] book is no longer in the hands of the
[1:04:48] angel it's inside the bride
[1:04:52] amen she is him as the living word she's
[1:04:57] the final voice this is exactly
[1:05:00] the great mystery plan that god devised
[1:05:03] for us to be as saint paul said
[1:05:06] filled with
[1:05:08] all
[1:05:09] the fullness
[1:05:11] of god
[1:05:13] amen
[1:05:14] he said that to the church he said that
[1:05:16] to a church in ephesus who had been
[1:05:19] believers for 30 years
[1:05:20] and he's saying now i but i i want to
[1:05:23] see you become all the fullness i want
[1:05:25] to see you filled so this this actually
[1:05:28] became an unrealized desire of his heart
[1:05:31] paul himself falling asleep and wading
[1:05:34] through seven church ages for this time
[1:05:37] when your perfection
[1:05:39] will deliver him back to the earth again
[1:05:42] and a body of flesh
[1:05:45] that's what they desire
[1:05:47] they here we are in this broken down
[1:05:49] body desiring that theophany but brother
[1:05:52] branham shows us those in that theophany
[1:05:54] are desiring to come back here as much
[1:05:56] as you're desiring to get there they're
[1:05:57] desiring to come back here hallelujah
[1:05:59] friends it's going to move the heart of
[1:06:01] god one of these mornings
[1:06:03] oh my
[1:06:06] so ephesians 3 19 and to know
[1:06:09] the love of christ this is preaching to
[1:06:11] born-again people
[1:06:14] to know
[1:06:15] the love of christ which passeth
[1:06:17] knowledge
[1:06:18] that you might be filled with all the
[1:06:21] fullness of god he goes on in the fourth
[1:06:23] chapter till we all come into the unity
[1:06:25] of the faith and under the knowledge of
[1:06:27] the son of god
[1:06:28] unto a perfect man unto the measure see
[1:06:32] there's another measurement under the
[1:06:34] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:06:38] of christ so we already eat the book yes
[1:06:41] amen
[1:06:42] that's why we're here we are to eat the
[1:06:44] book you know when you eat when do you
[1:06:48] normally stop
[1:06:49] when you're full
[1:06:52] amen
[1:06:53] i want to tell you something friends
[1:06:54] when you have me over for dinner
[1:06:56] you might set out some appetizers to tie
[1:06:58] me over till the full meal comes but
[1:07:01] they're not to tie me over till next
[1:07:03] time i come to your house to eat
[1:07:05] see so can i say to you tonight don't
[1:07:08] don't sit here at the table of the lord
[1:07:10] and nibble at the food and eat just
[1:07:12] enough to get you by the next sunday
[1:07:15] come on paul was desiring that you come
[1:07:17] into the whole fullness that you gain a
[1:07:20] knowledge that that's something that
[1:07:21] surpasses normal knowledge that the love
[1:07:24] of christ becomes so in you i mean
[1:07:26] that's what the capstone was that that
[1:07:29] perfect love that perfect fellowship
[1:07:31] that perfect god coming down and
[1:07:34] tabernacling himself in a people
[1:07:38] yeah when i'm at your home i'm there to
[1:07:40] get full you've invited me to come over
[1:07:43] and eat my fill
[1:07:45] so paul's desire then in ephesians 3 9
[1:07:48] was
[1:07:49] was that we might be filled with all the
[1:07:51] fullness of god jesus said in in matthew
[1:07:54] 26 and 20 uh 20 chapter 26 verse 26 and
[1:07:59] 27 take eat
[1:08:01] this is my body
[1:08:03] and take the cut and he took the cup and
[1:08:07] gave thanks and gave it to them saying
[1:08:11] drink ye
[1:08:12] all of it amen
[1:08:15] amen amen
[1:08:17] these aren't just accidental
[1:08:19] wording
[1:08:20] there's not a single word in the bible
[1:08:22] that's an accident it's all
[1:08:25] purpose written
[1:08:27] by a god with a purpose
[1:08:30] and he wrote it like he wrote it on
[1:08:32] purpose and he wants you to believe it
[1:08:34] on purpose
[1:08:36] so that when you get a body change it'll
[1:08:38] be on purpose
[1:08:40] you won't stumble into it it's not an
[1:08:41] accident hallelujah you can't
[1:08:44] accidentally have it you've got to be
[1:08:45] driven by the purpose of almighty god
[1:08:47] [Applause]
[1:08:49] so take heat as paul said that you might
[1:08:52] be filled with all the fullness of god
[1:08:54] jesus said take heed this is my body
[1:08:57] he took the cup and gave them he gave it
[1:08:59] to them saying drink you all of it as
[1:09:01] wonderful then as revelation 11 1
[1:09:05] shows us
[1:09:06] that we find that it is preceded by
[1:09:09] revelation 10 8 to 9. give me that
[1:09:12] brother caleb put that up and we're
[1:09:13] going to look at it now
[1:09:14] now
[1:09:16] as he puts it up
[1:09:18] we can't we'll first catch the eighth
[1:09:19] verse all right very familiar to us
[1:09:22] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[1:09:25] spake unto me again
[1:09:28] i'll just stay right there until i tell
[1:09:29] you to go to nine stay right on eight
[1:09:31] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[1:09:33] spake unto me again and said go and take
[1:09:35] the little book which is open in the
[1:09:37] hand of the angel which standeth upon
[1:09:39] the sea
[1:09:40] and upon the earth now
[1:09:43] there's not hardly anyone in here who
[1:09:45] almost couldn't close their eyes and
[1:09:47] quote the next line
[1:09:49] so i asked for the little book don't
[1:09:52] turn yet caleb so i asked for the little
[1:09:54] book and he said to me it'll be sweet on
[1:09:57] your lips but it'll be bitter in your
[1:09:59] belly
[1:10:00] haven't we read that
[1:10:03] i've read that all my life
[1:10:05] until i realized i hadn't
[1:10:09] what's that verse 9
[1:10:12] and i went unto the angel and said unto
[1:10:14] him give me the little book and he said
[1:10:16] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[1:10:19] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[1:10:22] be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[1:10:25] the
[1:10:25] the and brother now watch brother
[1:10:27] branham says
[1:10:29] so so let me let me let me make this
[1:10:32] point to you
[1:10:33] that
[1:10:34] the bitterness
[1:10:36] is not the last thing he wants you to
[1:10:39] remember
[1:10:41] amen amen and i as a preacher
[1:10:45] every preacher i've ever heard
[1:10:47] and i'm pretty sure even brother branham
[1:10:49] on tape puts it in reverse order
[1:10:51] that it'll be
[1:10:53] i've heard it since a boy it'll be on
[1:10:54] your lips sweet as honey but when it
[1:10:56] gets down into your belly oh it's going
[1:10:57] to be
[1:10:58] bitter it's going to be hard it's going
[1:10:59] to churn and brother branham says here's
[1:11:02] what here's what bitterness in the belly
[1:11:03] means you ready
[1:11:04] when you have to digest it then it gets
[1:11:07] bitter
[1:11:08] everybody's against you everybody
[1:11:10] telling you you're a holy roller you're
[1:11:12] this that or the other see
[1:11:15] you're off your head
[1:11:19] so it's hard to digest it now watch
[1:11:23] but when but when you're testifying of
[1:11:25] his glory it's sweet in your lips
[1:11:29] that's all see
[1:11:31] and when you stand up in a meeting you
[1:11:33] say glory to god hallelujah oh when
[1:11:36] you're going through that great siege
[1:11:40] you know what a siege is that's what
[1:11:41] cinecrib encircled jerusalem and
[1:11:44] hezekiah had to keep the people
[1:11:46] encouraged because they uh siege you
[1:11:48] know you know you're not going to try
[1:11:49] you don't even build all of that siege
[1:11:51] equipment to just you know expend all
[1:11:54] your men rushing the walls and get them
[1:11:56] all slaughtered that's a last resort
[1:11:57] battle tactic what you want to do is
[1:11:59] wait them out
[1:12:01] starve them out
[1:12:03] discourage them you know tell them
[1:12:05] you're going to lose tell them you got
[1:12:06] to butcher them tell them you're gonna
[1:12:07] kill their family and their children and
[1:12:09] if they'll just open the gate you'll
[1:12:10] spare you'll spare everybody and you
[1:12:12] don't have any food and you're in a
[1:12:14] terrible trial and it's a horrible
[1:12:16] affliction give up it's a siege that's
[1:12:18] what the devil does
[1:12:20] when you're in the midst of a trial it's
[1:12:22] a siege of the enemy and he has
[1:12:24] surrounded your mind to say oh this
[1:12:27] problem and that problem and this
[1:12:28] problem and that problem and this person
[1:12:30] in that trouble and this affliction and
[1:12:32] nobody loves you and god's forsaking you
[1:12:34] and oh you're going to lose and you're
[1:12:35] going to die i'm here to tell you that's
[1:12:37] just the enemy in a siege tactic
[1:12:41] amen
[1:12:41] brother branham says but then
[1:12:44] when you're going through that great
[1:12:45] siege it's hard a prophet acknowledges
[1:12:48] it's hard but when you're out of that
[1:12:51] great siege you can testify of it then
[1:12:55] it's sweet in the lips that's right
[1:12:57] that's this book of redemption amen see
[1:13:01] so the bitterness of trials is first but
[1:13:04] friends
[1:13:06] remember that it is the bitterness of
[1:13:08] trials that teach us such
[1:13:12] beautiful things
[1:13:14] such beautiful wonderful they mature us
[1:13:17] they grow us they strengthen us you're
[1:13:20] going to help me preach tonight isn't
[1:13:22] that true i'm not making that up you're
[1:13:24] human beings you go through trials isn't
[1:13:27] it true
[1:13:28] that when we come through the siege and
[1:13:30] out the other side we look back yes it
[1:13:33] was painful yes it hurt yes i wouldn't
[1:13:36] wish it on my enemies but i i wouldn't
[1:13:38] change it for the world
[1:13:41] because i realize now that i've come
[1:13:43] through it i got victory and it's made
[1:13:45] me stronger and it's made me wiser and
[1:13:47] it's made me love god more
[1:13:51] bitterness isn't the last thing he wants
[1:13:53] on your on your in your memory he wants
[1:13:55] the joy of the lord and when you come
[1:13:58] through you have a testimony that the
[1:14:00] trial was sweet
[1:14:02] [Applause]
[1:14:04] see
[1:14:07] they mature us
[1:14:08] troubles they grow us
[1:14:12] they strengthen us
[1:14:14] so much so that they leave a
[1:14:17] a lasting sweetness in our mouth for
[1:14:19] having gone through them
[1:14:21] [Music]
[1:14:22] i speak from deep experience
[1:14:25] you could speak from deep experience
[1:14:26] today
[1:14:27] i was talking to my
[1:14:29] grandson today and we were talking about
[1:14:31] this very topic
[1:14:32] and i said you know giddy and i said
[1:14:35] you know at my age me and ma'am all we
[1:14:37] we've been we've been through a lot more
[1:14:38] trials than you we've been through a lot
[1:14:40] more heartaches and a lot of more
[1:14:42] heartbreaks and i can tell you that life
[1:14:45] sometimes doesn't seem fair and it's
[1:14:47] actually by design it's not ever
[1:14:48] supposed to be fair because this life's
[1:14:51] not even about this life i said don't
[1:14:53] don't forget that g don't forget that
[1:14:55] now this life is just a training ground
[1:14:57] that's all it is it's all about the next
[1:14:59] one coming where there's worlds and
[1:15:01] worlds of worlds of worlds where there's
[1:15:04] a plan where there's a kingdom where
[1:15:06] there's a christ where there's a royal
[1:15:07] family oh my friends i'm here to tell
[1:15:10] you our future is very bright
[1:15:16] i've experienced these kinds of trials
[1:15:18] many times personally
[1:15:21] and
[1:15:22] i look back on them and i
[1:15:24] i wouldn't wish one of them on any of
[1:15:26] you amen i went with some on my enemies
[1:15:29] because sometimes they were very bitter
[1:15:32] they were very hard to endure
[1:15:34] life seemed wretchedly unfair life
[1:15:36] seemed uh you know i i remember
[1:15:39] times when you know when my boys were
[1:15:42] little and and i'm not going to get
[1:15:44] telling stories tonight but but just
[1:15:47] you know
[1:15:48] and i remember that we made a decision
[1:15:51] you know and we lived in an area we
[1:15:52] lived right in an area where
[1:15:55] where
[1:15:56] where women working in the factories in
[1:15:58] the mills they went to work with their
[1:15:59] husbands and carried their lunch pail
[1:16:01] and worked side by side
[1:16:03] see and i'm not here preaching about you
[1:16:05] know work or women working i understand
[1:16:07] the needs of society i'm not even
[1:16:09] talking about that i'm talking there's
[1:16:11] greater and lesser greater and lesser
[1:16:14] noble things and brother brandon was
[1:16:15] against certain things of women working
[1:16:18] completely and so but then there was
[1:16:21] things that were allowances were made
[1:16:23] and so i'm not here to preach on that
[1:16:24] i'm just trying to give you a testimony
[1:16:26] that but i remember that we made a
[1:16:28] decision and all of our friends all of
[1:16:30] our other friends who were our age you
[1:16:33] know and he and some of them even
[1:16:34] younger than us and they were a couple
[1:16:36] of years they had been the younger
[1:16:37] generation and deb and i grew up we got
[1:16:40] married and then they grew up and got
[1:16:41] married and and by by that by the time
[1:16:43] you got you're an adult four or five
[1:16:44] years difference doesn't mean anything
[1:16:46] and you know how that goes
[1:16:48] and
[1:16:49] you know they
[1:16:50] they were all working and because they
[1:16:52] were all having a two income household i
[1:16:55] mean they had all the nicest trucks and
[1:16:57] all the boats and all the all the all
[1:16:59] the jet skis and all the land and and
[1:17:02] the horses and the and the and the
[1:17:04] vacations and the big bucks and here we
[1:17:06] were just struggling living in cold
[1:17:09] rental houses trying to make ends meet
[1:17:11] but we made a determination that i would
[1:17:13] leave the mother at home with my
[1:17:16] children
[1:17:17] and and and and the most she ever did
[1:17:19] one time in the wintertime went and went
[1:17:22] with some church sisters to clean burn
[1:17:24] houses for some company where they'd
[1:17:26] catch on fire and you go in and wipe off
[1:17:27] everything which is what
[1:17:29] you know she was used to doing and and
[1:17:31] she did that one time through one to a
[1:17:33] single winner but but other than that we
[1:17:36] had to watch our our friends and many of
[1:17:38] them younger than us
[1:17:40] excel
[1:17:42] and excel
[1:17:43] and just seemed like the sky was the
[1:17:45] limit and every week we were just barely
[1:17:47] making it every week barely making it
[1:17:50] borrowing a little money from a mother
[1:17:52] or dad here borrowing a little from a
[1:17:53] mother-in-law or falling in love here
[1:17:54] borrowing from a friend trying to make
[1:17:56] ends meet but you know you want me to
[1:17:58] tell you can i fast forward to today
[1:18:01] i go back to those couples and almost
[1:18:04] all of them are in the world almost all
[1:18:07] of their children are in the world
[1:18:09] almost all of their grandchildren are in
[1:18:11] the world and today i got a home that
[1:18:14] loves god and i got children that love
[1:18:16] god and i got grandchildren that love
[1:18:19] god i'm here to tell you i went god's
[1:18:21] way
[1:18:23] and it was a hard trial but i wouldn't
[1:18:25] change that trial for nothing
[1:18:28] i'm so glad that i stuck it out that way
[1:18:31] hallelujah when my boys come home from
[1:18:34] school and burst into the house and say
[1:18:36] mom there's a mother there to greet them
[1:18:39] i tell you there's no substitute for a
[1:18:41] mother she's the greatest thing ever
[1:18:43] invented
[1:18:44] hallelujah friends
[1:18:46] i've had times in ministry where people
[1:18:48] rise against you and i've had terrible
[1:18:50] things and lies said about me and and
[1:18:53] all you can do is take the high road you
[1:18:54] can't fight that stuff you have to let
[1:18:56] jesus defend you and he will
[1:18:59] he always will he always will
[1:19:03] and i am i am here to testify today that
[1:19:06] every time i was attacked wrongly and
[1:19:08] innocently i stood quiet and the lord
[1:19:11] defended me every single time and i've
[1:19:14] been through hard deep cutting times and
[1:19:16] trials
[1:19:18] amen
[1:19:20] but i look back on them and my wife and
[1:19:22] i talked about it today
[1:19:23] i said you know honey
[1:19:25] we wouldn't change one of those trials
[1:19:28] she said nope not one of them i wouldn't
[1:19:31] even go back and alter one
[1:19:34] i wouldn't i wouldn't change it at all
[1:19:36] because now on this side of the siege
[1:19:40] it's so sweet on my lips
[1:19:42] jesus has become so sweet to me i know i
[1:19:46] can trust him and and the only way to
[1:19:48] know that is by experience of things
[1:19:50] that we have to go through and that's
[1:19:52] why i say they mature us they strengthen
[1:19:55] us you know we had we stood and come on
[1:19:58] let's be honest here today amen
[1:20:02] had we
[1:20:03] had we stood at the head of our trials
[1:20:05] and afflictions and
[1:20:07] looked down the path and
[1:20:10] the lord would have let us
[1:20:13] you know see all the suffering we were
[1:20:15] going to go through and the hardships
[1:20:17] you know we'd have tried to go around it
[1:20:21] come on all you holy people
[1:20:23] wouldn't we
[1:20:25] hey we're all in this together we can be
[1:20:26] honest
[1:20:27] we'd went around it
[1:20:29] if the lord would have stood there at
[1:20:30] the trail head and said that's what's
[1:20:31] going waiting out i said okay thank you
[1:20:33] and as soon as he left out i went okay
[1:20:41] though we'd miss the training
[1:20:44] we'd miss the growth
[1:20:46] we'd miss the maturity
[1:20:48] uh that that that was given to to bring
[1:20:51] us growth and maturity the trial that
[1:20:54] was given to bring us these things we'd
[1:20:56] never walk down the path of pain
[1:20:57] willingly no no no we're human beings we
[1:21:00] want the path of least resistance
[1:21:03] standing at the trail head of a deep
[1:21:05] trial friends now let's be real honest
[1:21:08] i would certainly try to avoid it
[1:21:13] amen but
[1:21:14] the lord in his kindness
[1:21:16] doesn't show us
[1:21:19] amen he doesn't show you what you're
[1:21:22] going to suffer
[1:21:25] what happens is we find ourselves in it
[1:21:28] we get through it
[1:21:30] and we're grateful to him for it
[1:21:33] this is just as much a part of eating
[1:21:36] the book
[1:21:38] as passing from death to life as getting
[1:21:40] a new body change as becoming the word
[1:21:42] made flesh in this day this is part of
[1:21:45] that process just as much as holiness
[1:21:47] living and the ways that we live and the
[1:21:49] things we don't do and don't go and
[1:21:51] don't say and don't participate in i'm
[1:21:53] here to tell you something friends we're
[1:21:55] not here to ask the lord jesus never
[1:21:57] promised you it would be easy only that
[1:21:59] it would be worth it yes amen see
[1:22:04] because
[1:22:04] the trail that we're on though it may be
[1:22:06] very
[1:22:08] troublesome
[1:22:09] but i want to tell you where it leads
[1:22:11] hebrews 12 22
[1:22:13] but ye are coming to mount zion
[1:22:16] and unto the city of the living god
[1:22:20] isn't that beautiful you got that caleb
[1:22:22] hebrews 12 22 but we are common to mount
[1:22:27] zion unto the city of the living god
[1:22:31] the heavenly jerusalem and to an
[1:22:33] innumerable
[1:22:35] company of angels
[1:22:40] you know
[1:22:42] i i
[1:22:43] had a really nice trip here recently and
[1:22:46] i've
[1:22:46] never done a lot of wilderness hiking
[1:22:48] and
[1:22:49] we took off out west to see my sister
[1:22:52] and john and martha
[1:22:54] there are big hikers and they they took
[1:22:56] me on some trails and
[1:22:58] and my i so enjoyed it this was after
[1:23:00] i'd had that episode and i wanted to
[1:23:02] just see
[1:23:03] you know if the doctors if what they
[1:23:05] were saying was true that i should be
[1:23:06] able to go right back to it and i was i
[1:23:08] was able to you know run up and down
[1:23:10] those trails and really was watching my
[1:23:12] heart rate and i was just so enjoying it
[1:23:15] but i learned some things about hiking
[1:23:17] you know when you're standing at the
[1:23:18] trailhead of some long trek through the
[1:23:20] wilderness
[1:23:22] you're always going to have like a map
[1:23:24] and they're going to have signs you know
[1:23:26] no you can't have a dog on this trail
[1:23:28] you can't smoke on this trail you can't
[1:23:30] take alcohol you can't camp you can you
[1:23:32] know no no motorized vehicles you'll
[1:23:34] have all these signs and placards and
[1:23:35] then you have you'll have the map and
[1:23:37] you have elevations you have turns you
[1:23:39] have distance and when you're standing
[1:23:41] there you know you're looking at that
[1:23:42] map and as you study the turns and the
[1:23:44] elevations and the the total distance in
[1:23:47] and the total distance back and you know
[1:23:49] you have some natural wonder that you
[1:23:52] want to see and experience perhaps it's
[1:23:54] a some summit you want to stand on top
[1:23:57] of
[1:23:58] and look down over some sweeping vista
[1:24:00] some seascape some beautiful you know
[1:24:03] cascading valley and nature and and
[1:24:07] and and it's just uh it's a glorious

[1:27:07] the food of revelation 10 9
[1:27:10] that we read take the book and eat it
[1:27:13] and it shall be in thy belly bitter but
[1:27:15] upon thy lips it shall be sweet as honey
[1:27:20] the food of revelation 10 9 is the exact
[1:27:22] same food
[1:27:24] that jesus spoke of in our text in john
[1:27:28] 6. amen
[1:27:30] it's the exact same food whoso eateth my
[1:27:34] flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal
[1:27:37] life and i will raise him up at the last
[1:27:40] day but now you notice something that we
[1:27:42] also read
[1:27:44] in revelation chapter 14
[1:27:46] you remember this and there followed
[1:27:48] another angel saying babylon has fallen
[1:27:50] has fallen that great city because she
[1:27:53] made all nations drink of the wine of
[1:27:56] the wrath of her fornication i'm here to
[1:27:58] tell you something friends mankind has
[1:28:01] reached a unique hour that has never
[1:28:03] been in the earth you've got the perfect
[1:28:05] word and you've got satan's eden and
[1:28:09] you've got a beast system and mankind is
[1:28:11] facing two choices and two choices only
[1:28:14] you either will eat the body word of the
[1:28:16] son of man with its life-giving
[1:28:18] nutrients or you will drink the
[1:28:21] wine of the wrath of her fornication and
[1:28:24] i'm here to tell you her wine has no
[1:28:27] life-giving sustenance
[1:28:29] i want you to know that young people it
[1:28:31] has no nourishment no minerals no
[1:28:35] spiritual vitamins for you
[1:28:38] her wine
[1:28:40] has no life-giving substance or
[1:28:43] sustenance whatever only a drunkenness
[1:28:47] that will lead you
[1:28:49] to destruction amen
[1:28:52] and there followed another angel saying
[1:28:55] babylon is fallen
[1:28:58] is fallen
[1:28:59] that great city
[1:29:01] because
[1:29:03] she made all nations drink of the wine
[1:29:06] of the wrath of her
[1:29:08] fornication but i want you to know
[1:29:10] something friends if we eat the body
[1:29:13] word of the son of man you not only you
[1:29:16] not only get all the food and the
[1:29:19] nourishment and nutrients that you need
[1:29:21] but it's also the drink you don't need
[1:29:24] her wine because jesus said for my flesh
[1:29:28] is meat indeed and my blood is drink
[1:29:32] indeed i want to say in the words of
[1:29:35] jesus drinking all of it
[1:29:38] that's the that's the problem that too

[1:29:42] all i don't know i don't know the path
[1:29:45] of heartache uh you know that that he
[1:29:47] may take you down but drinking all of it
[1:29:50] i don't know what might happen tomorrow
[1:29:52] i don't know what sad story you might
[1:29:54] hear i don't know what trial you might
[1:29:55] go into or you might continue into from
[1:29:58] one you're in right now but drinking all
[1:30:00] of it
[1:30:01] hallelujah eat upon the body word of the
[1:30:04] son of man because his body is his food
[1:30:06] indeed and his blood is drake indeed
[1:30:10] hallelujah it won't leave you hungover
[1:30:12] from drunkenness it'll leave you with
[1:30:14] joy unspeakable and full of glory it'll
[1:30:17] leave you with stimulation of revelation
[1:30:20] it'll give you a peace that passes
[1:30:21] understanding i don't care what the
[1:30:23] trial is
[1:30:25] i don't care what the affliction is
[1:30:28] eat upon him drink upon him
[1:30:30] how many want that tonight how many won
[1:30:33] that part of revelation eat the book
[1:30:36] take it it'll be bitter in your belly
[1:30:38] but don't worry joy comes in the morning
[1:30:42] it'll be sweet and honey when you have a
[1:30:44] testimony when the siege is over
[1:30:48] amen
[1:30:50] i want you to know something friends the
[1:30:52] devil can't hold you in the siege

[1:31:00] dawn joy comes
[1:31:03] in the morning for my flesh is meet
[1:31:05] indeed and my blood
[1:31:08] is drink indeed

[1:31:12] friends and say lord
[1:31:14] i want to have that water that flows
[1:31:16] from the rock i want to have the body
[1:31:19] word i want to eat the book i want to
[1:31:21] become the book i want to have my whole
[1:31:23] life committed to it lord god

[1:31:42] you eat the body of the sun or you eat
[1:31:44] the flesh

[1:37:56] the lord did something really special
[1:37:58] for him at the camp some of you
[1:37:59] teenagers he's testified to you you know
[1:38:01] about it
[1:38:02] and he just gave me the whole breakdown
[1:38:04] of how it went at the camp and then
[1:38:05] afterward and then
[1:38:07] you know the enemy coming and
[1:38:09] and he he said he was
[1:38:11] you know making commitments to god and
[1:38:14] just determination but yet the enemy
[1:38:17] fighting him and fighting him i told him
[1:38:18] i said gee you need to give that to the
[1:38:20] whole church i said everybody love to
[1:38:21] hear what god did for you
[1:38:23] and
[1:38:24] he's driving up over the bridge here
[1:38:27] headed over onto ladies island are
[1:38:29] coming back i don't remember which one

[1:38:49] and
[1:38:50] and suddenly

[1:38:53] experience at the camp and afterwards
[1:38:55] another experience and now he's driving
[1:38:57] and
[1:38:59] and he says you know he said i there was
[1:39:01] still just something not fully there
[1:39:03] and that's exactly how brother branham
[1:39:05] explained it your justification
[1:39:06] sanctification then you go on to receive
[1:39:08] the baptism of the holy spirit

[1:39:22] and it had to make a really hard
[1:39:23] decision and separate himself from
[1:39:25] friends and associates who weren't
[1:39:27] believers
[1:39:28] and he said lord

[1:39:54] praise you in the storm i'll praise you
[1:39:56] in the storm it won't matter what the
