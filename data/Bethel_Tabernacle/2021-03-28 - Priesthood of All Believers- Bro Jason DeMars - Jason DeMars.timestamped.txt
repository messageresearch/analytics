[0:08] we're so thankful for how you've given
[0:10] us your spirit
[0:12] lord you've changed our lives and you're
[0:15] moving in a mighty way in our hearts
[0:17] lord and we're so thankful
[0:19] we pray that you'd continue this move
[0:23] amongst your people lord draw us near to
[0:27] you
[0:27] move in hearts lord bring healing
[0:30] deliverance
[0:33] spiritual strength to your people lord
[0:37] we need you to come to confirm your word
[0:40] in the hearts of the people
[0:42] lord that it would that we would become
[0:44] those living
[0:46] written epistles read and known of all
[0:49] men
[0:50] we ask these things in jesus christ's
[0:52] name amen
[0:55] for this sunday school i'm going to be
[0:56] speaking on the priesthood of
[0:58] all believers and first scripture i want
[1:02] to look at is exodus 28
[1:05] and verse 1.
[1:13] and take thou unto thee aaron thy
[1:16] brother
[1:17] and his sons with him from among the
[1:19] children of israel that he may minister
[1:21] unto me
[1:23] in the priest's office even arab nadab
[1:26] aaron nadab and abihu eleazar and
[1:29] ithamer
[1:31] aaron's sons amen can be seated
[1:38] so just to give a little bit background
[1:40] to this priesthood of all
[1:43] believers and we'll talk about it more
[1:45] in detail as we go along but
[1:47] in in the the history of the church
[1:52] the ministry office began to be spoken
[1:55] about
[1:56] as a priest right
[1:59] and so time went on this took on
[2:03] so many different forms that basically
[2:05] he was a mediator between
[2:09] god and the laity
[2:13] and so this is like the nic the fruition
[2:16] of the nicolaitan spirit to conquer
[2:20] the laity and so the priest now is the
[2:22] only one that can interpret the bible
[2:25] you can't even you a laity person can't
[2:27] even read the bible
[2:29] because it would bring him so much
[2:30] destruction in his life
[2:32] that's the belief system that they had
[2:35] and so then through the sacraments of
[2:37] the church the grace of god
[2:40] through the priest is given to
[2:43] the people and so that's the
[2:46] thing that it took took on and luther
[2:50] uh in his work that he wrote to the
[2:53] um the the german people
[2:56] he he said that every believer
[2:59] is a priest and it was a
[3:03] radical departure from
[3:06] the understanding of the medieval church
[3:10] in the dark ages but it was
[3:13] scripture amen and so we want to talk
[3:16] about that and and look at that
[3:18] so looking at the priesthood
[3:22] the word the word there in exodus 28
[3:27] is kahan usually it's cohen
[3:30] so this is like the act of being a
[3:32] priest so priests office
[3:33] office it means to mediate in religious
[3:37] offerings so right within the concept of
[3:41] a priest
[3:42] it's speaking of a mediator
[3:45] so under the old covenant there were
[3:48] three divisions of priests there was the
[3:50] high priests
[3:51] there was the priests and then there was
[3:54] the levites
[3:55] the high priest and the priests all came
[3:57] from the family of
[4:00] aaron and aaron only so the people that
[4:03] offered
[4:03] sacrifices that did offer the incense
[4:07] all those activities was all done by
[4:11] aaron's family and descendants one
[4:14] person
[4:15] was chosen from the from that family
[4:18] to be the high priest then the rest they
[4:21] had their different orders and
[4:23] and and hierarchy developed
[4:26] and all these things developed over time
[4:29] that you
[4:29] that you see that that we arrive at in
[4:31] the new testament
[4:32] where jesus is confronting them and you
[4:36] have the
[4:36] the chief priests so it's like a family
[4:39] of chief priests and sort of a rotation
[4:42] all of these things these then there's
[4:44] multiple hierarchies that they made
[4:46] they're not scriptural they're developed
[4:48] after the fact
[4:50] just like we have hierarchies developed
[4:53] in the church they did it with the
[4:55] levitical priesthood
[4:59] so the function of priests of the high
[5:01] priest priest levites
[5:02] priests and a high priest had a specific
[5:05] duties
[5:05] he was also the leader of the priests
[5:08] and then the priests had
[5:10] many many different duties and then
[5:12] there was the levites the levites could
[5:14] be from any
[5:15] levitical family and they were
[5:18] in charge of sacred things uh they were
[5:22] they were the ones when the ark of the
[5:24] covenant was to be moved
[5:26] they weren't were never to touch it but
[5:28] they would put poles through it and
[5:30] carry it so that was their duty when
[5:33] they wrapped up the tabernacle now it
[5:35] changed
[5:36] and it when there was a temple built and
[5:39] it's in one structure
[5:40] but still they the same responsibilities
[5:44] basically continued on
[5:47] the function of priests was not just to
[5:50] offer
[5:51] sacrifices but it was also to teach
[5:54] and to judge in scriptural matters
[5:59] in people's lives as i said time went on
[6:03] they developed hierarchies and they
[6:06] developed parties sects denominations of
[6:09] priests etc
[6:12] let's look at hebrews 5 verse 1.
[6:22] for every high priest is taken from
[6:23] among men
[6:26] is ordained for men in things pertaining
[6:29] to god that he may offer both
[6:32] gifts and sacrifices for
[6:35] sins okay so the priest is taken
[6:39] from among men of course we understand
[6:41] in the old testament it was
[6:42] aaron's family and
[6:45] but they're taken from among men and
[6:47] they're ordained
[6:49] for men in other words they're there
[6:52] for the purpose of serving
[6:55] men and in things pertaining to
[6:59] god in other words it's a minister it's
[7:01] a servant
[7:02] it's a place to be a mediator between
[7:06] god and men hebrews
[7:09] 3 verse 1. in the old testament
[7:12] they had many high priests succession of
[7:14] high priest they had
[7:16] a family of high priests it was like a
[7:18] almost like a a
[7:21] genetic monarchy where it went from one
[7:24] to one to one
[7:25] they had some changes in there due to
[7:27] the sins of eli and his family
[7:29] but basically it was it was a
[7:33] passed on from from father to son
[7:38] hebrews 3 1 wherefore holy brethren
[7:40] partakers of the heavenly calling
[7:43] consider the apostle and high priest of
[7:45] our profession
[7:47] christ jesus now under the new covenant
[7:52] who's the high priest it's jesus christ
[7:56] first timothy 2 verse 5 says there's one
[7:59] god
[8:00] and one mediator between god and men the
[8:03] man christ jesus
[8:06] there's only one mediator there's only
[8:07] one high priest and he didn't offer
[8:10] a sacrifice distinct from himself
[8:14] and continually do it as we find in
[8:16] hebrews he offered himself
[8:18] once for all he's not continuing
[8:22] why because it was a perfect sacrifice
[8:24] that accomplished
[8:26] something that was perfect amen that was
[8:28] complete
[8:29] nothing needed to be added to it so he
[8:32] as that high priest
[8:33] still stands as a mediator between
[8:37] us and god
[8:40] amen first peter 2 verse 9. but ye are a
[8:54] chosen generation
[8:56] a royal priesthood a holy nation
[8:59] a peculiar people that you should show
[9:01] forth the praises of him
[9:03] who hath called you out of darkness into
[9:05] his marvelous
[9:07] light now
[9:10] who is a chosen generation who is a
[9:13] royal priesthood
[9:15] is it only the five-fold ministry no
[9:19] every believer now is
[9:22] anointed by the holy ghost
[9:25] to be a priest is it just men
[9:29] just the brothers or priests does it
[9:32] give some distinctions
[9:34] no it's every single believer is now
[9:38] a priest but we truly only have one
[9:42] high priest and we truly only have
[9:45] one mediator but i want you to look at
[9:47] it differently
[9:49] because under the old testament did
[9:51] those priests have the baptism of the
[9:52] holy ghost
[9:54] no what is what do we have in the new
[9:57] testament
[9:59] christ in you the hope of glory
[10:04] why are we priests because the high
[10:06] priest is living inside of us
[10:10] so then what what are we what do we do
[10:13] um let's let's look at ii corinthians 5.
[10:17] 18
[10:25] and all things are of god who hath
[10:27] reconciled us to himself by jesus christ
[10:30] and hath given to us the ministry of
[10:33] reconciliation
[10:35] to wit that god was in christ
[10:37] reconciling the world unto himself
[10:40] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[10:42] and hath committed unto us
[10:44] the word of reconciliation now then we
[10:47] are ambassadors for christ as though god
[10:50] did beseech you by us we pray you in
[10:53] christ
[10:53] that be reconciled to
[10:57] god i want to ask a question
[11:00] do you believe that these verses are
[11:02] merely limited to the five-fold ministry
[11:05] i wouldn't deny that the five-fold
[11:07] ministry has a special
[11:09] calling within that but these verses are
[11:12] not
[11:14] limited to that because right before
[11:17] we read this it says we are a new
[11:19] creation
[11:21] if any man be in christ he's a new
[11:23] creation old things
[11:25] passed away behold all things are become
[11:28] new and he's
[11:28] then the next person says and he's given
[11:30] to us
[11:31] the ministry of reconciliation
[11:34] and but but who is doing it
[11:37] who is performing it
[11:40] is it is it god in heaven and then
[11:44] uh between god you have the mother of
[11:48] god and then you have
[11:49] christ and then angels and then another
[11:52] group of angels and then you got the
[11:54] pope
[11:54] and archbishops and cardinals and
[11:58] and bishops and priests
[12:01] that's the that's the that's the old
[12:03] viewpoint
[12:04] but here's we have a problem and and you
[12:07] say well we don't have a problem with
[12:08] that
[12:08] we're message believers we listen in
[12:10] every day to brother branham condemning
[12:11] that
[12:13] but we maybe we do have a problem a
[12:15] little bit of a problem
[12:16] we see nicolet and preachers raise up
[12:19] and they
[12:19] misuse the understanding of the fivefold
[12:22] ministry
[12:23] and they start taking that and putting
[12:25] it upon this priesthood oh
[12:27] we have a priesthood again the fivefold
[12:30] ministry and if you don't
[12:31] and the pastor is the supreme authority
[12:34] true true
[12:38] but that doesn't make him now the priest
[12:41] mediating between you and god but that's
[12:44] the viewpoint
[12:46] that preachers and nicolaitan preachers
[12:49] in this message
[12:50] have put forth you've got to
[12:53] listen to your pastor to be saved
[12:58] your pastor is a tool in god's hands
[13:01] to build your faith but it's not your
[13:04] pastor
[13:06] that's leading you to salvation
[13:09] the holy spirit does that work
[13:12] me your pastor we are
[13:16] simply a voice to remind you of what's
[13:19] in here and to help you better
[13:22] understand
[13:23] what's in here but you
[13:26] have to be like the bereans
[13:30] you're like the bereans you're not like
[13:32] they were in the old testament in the
[13:33] old testament
[13:34] they are waiting for a sacrifice to
[13:36] happen we're waiting for this
[13:39] man to do his duty before god
[13:42] and then we can receive god's blessings
[13:46] no no you can go in your closet
[13:50] in your bedroom you can lay on your bed
[13:54] and approach god and he can talk to you
[13:56] and he can reveal this message to you
[14:00] does he use preachers i sure hope he
[14:02] does
[14:04] i sure hope he does and i know he does
[14:08] that's scriptural i believe he does
[14:12] but remember this is not what i'm saying
[14:16] is not my words doesn't accomplish your
[14:19] salvation
[14:20] christ has already accomplished your
[14:22] salvation
[14:24] and you believe that you don't need me
[14:26] to get to christ
[14:28] and and that that that is an issue
[14:32] and that is a misunderstanding even
[14:34] sincere people
[14:36] very sincere people but they they
[14:39] misunderstand and say
[14:41] my pastor is going to lead me into the
[14:44] rapture
[14:44] is there a quote that says something
[14:46] like that well not really
[14:49] but people have quoted it as though it
[14:52] says that
[14:53] but it don't say that it says
[14:56] when you have difficult situations in
[14:58] your church and people are fussing and
[15:00] fighting with each other
[15:01] brother brahms referring to brother
[15:03] neville and he says stay with your
[15:05] pastor
[15:06] he's ordained to lead you through well
[15:08] brother neville was a good godly
[15:10] man that brother branham knew by
[15:12] experience could lead them through
[15:14] what if the preacher was not a good
[15:16] godly man
[15:17] and he was an ornery guy and all he did
[15:19] was damage people should we stay bar
[15:21] by our pastor so that he would lead us
[15:23] through through what
[15:25] he's the problem
[15:31] and so this is the this is the issue is
[15:33] that a real
[15:34] preacher understands his role simply as
[15:38] to be a tool
[15:39] to communicate god's word with you but
[15:41] he doesn't bring you salvation
[15:45] the word that he preaches can accomplish
[15:47] salvation
[15:48] but god is dealing directly with you as
[15:51] an
[15:51] individual he's not dealing with you
[15:54] through me
[15:55] in order to get to god you got to come
[15:57] through the preacher that's not
[15:58] scriptural
[16:00] amen that's not correct god uses the
[16:03] preacher
[16:04] god sends the preacher as a gift but his
[16:06] words are to communicate
[16:08] god's words directly to you and
[16:11] it isn't even him he needs to understand
[16:13] that
[16:14] and you need to understand that it isn't
[16:16] even him
[16:17] he is supposed to merely be a vessel and
[16:19] a tool for god
[16:21] to get to you because god is working
[16:24] in you directly and this you know the
[16:29] these things it takes balance by the
[16:31] holy spirit
[16:33] and when we there's a thousand different
[16:36] directions you can go
[16:38] the wrong way there's one right way
[16:42] and it's it's very important you can't
[16:45] take this and say we don't need
[16:46] preachers i'm staying home
[16:48] i don't i don't need anything i just
[16:50] read the bible
[16:53] that's not scriptural but people will
[16:55] take this idea
[16:57] that's a direction that a ditch that
[17:00] people go into
[17:01] the other ditch that people go into is
[17:02] we need the five-fold ministry
[17:04] and the five-fold ministry now becomes a
[17:06] mediator between
[17:07] god and men and that's not it
[17:11] that's not it you are a mediator between
[17:14] god and men if you really want to look
[17:16] at it every believer is
[17:19] every single believer is why because
[17:22] he's committed to us
[17:23] the word the ministry of reconciliation
[17:28] to each of us anyone that's a new
[17:30] creation in christ
[17:32] has the word of reconciliation committed
[17:34] to them so that
[17:35] now you are a go-between between god
[17:39] and man no you didn't offer the
[17:41] sacrifice you're not a high priest
[17:45] you're you're you're one you're one of
[17:47] the priests
[17:49] you're you're a priest you're part of
[17:51] the order of melchizedek
[17:53] if you want to put it that way we're all
[17:55] a royal priesthood
[17:57] so i just wanna i'm gonna kind of back
[18:00] up to what i was talking about before
[18:01] and not that we can
[18:03] completely need this but i think some of
[18:05] the history is helpful just to see
[18:08] balance these things out this is reading
[18:11] from the gospel coalition
[18:13] website talking about the priesthood of
[18:14] all believers the medieval church taught
[18:17] that god works exclusively through a
[18:18] select class of priests as they
[18:20] administered the seven sacraments of the
[18:22] church
[18:23] protestants on the other hand believe
[18:25] that all people in the church are
[18:26] priests or in the language of the 16th
[18:28] century
[18:28] reformer martin luther the priesthood of
[18:31] all believers
[18:32] what are the difference differences
[18:34] between these two views
[18:36] in short the medieval view rests on the
[18:38] teaching of church tradition whereas the
[18:40] protestant view
[18:41] grows out of scripture medieval
[18:42] christians believe that the church was a
[18:44] part of a celestial hierarchy
[18:46] where everything in the heavens and
[18:47] earth had its place in a great chain of
[18:49] being
[18:50] the great chain begins with god then
[18:52] archangels angels heavenly hierarchy
[18:54] finds its earthly parallel through the
[18:56] sacraments those who are inspired by god
[18:58] to comprehend them and those initiated
[19:00] by them
[19:02] god passes his knowledge and grace down
[19:04] the chain
[19:05] to the angels you see how it's a it's a
[19:08] means to control
[19:10] right it's a means to control that's all
[19:13] it is who in turn invests this
[19:14] information
[19:15] in the sacraments and those who
[19:17] administer the sacraments the priests
[19:19] who then give them to the laity
[19:22] salvation chiefly comes through the
[19:24] sacraments and the priests who
[19:25] administer them
[19:27] and the priests are a unique class of
[19:28] individual have been gifted by god to
[19:30] contemplate the things of god
[19:32] they are of a higher order than ordinary
[19:34] people who have no
[19:36] capacity for such sublime truth this
[19:39] view of hierarchy prevailed in the
[19:41] church
[19:42] through the middle ages until the 16th
[19:43] century protestant reform
[19:45] reformation luther challenged this
[19:48] prevailing notion because he rejected
[19:50] the church's claims he believed the
[19:51] church
[19:52] rested its idea of the unique priestly
[19:54] class on tradition rather than the
[19:56] authority of scripture
[19:57] luther instead believed that offering
[20:00] the sacrifice of the mass did not make
[20:01] one a priest but rather anyone who had
[20:03] faith in christ
[20:05] our great high priest was indeed a
[20:08] priest of god
[20:09] in lit luther's typical pithy manner he
[20:12] claimed faith alone as the true
[20:13] priestly office luther's idea of the
[20:16] priesthood of all believers versus the
[20:18] priesthood of only a select few
[20:20] rests in the priestly office of christ
[20:23] and in the believer's blessing
[20:25] to share in all that christ is through
[20:28] union
[20:29] with him that is where we secure
[20:33] our blessing through christ it's not
[20:36] through
[20:37] me it's not through your pastor
[20:41] with any all of us are merely tools
[20:44] in god's hand not just the preacher all
[20:47] of us
[20:50] my wife is a tool in the hand of god
[20:53] to help me right even my children
[20:57] are a tool in the hand of god these
[20:59] things the
[21:02] god i think the thing is i want you to
[21:04] understand
[21:06] god is working in you god is working the
[21:09] teenager
[21:10] that's filled with the holy ghost it
[21:13] doesn't it doesn't have to be
[21:14] well now you have some great
[21:16] qualification god will use you
[21:18] if you have the holy ghost god can use
[21:22] you
[21:24] ephesians see
[21:28] ephesians chapter 4.
[21:34] verse 11 and 12 and he gave some
[21:37] apostles and some prophets and some
[21:39] evangelists and some pastors and
[21:41] teachers
[21:42] i want you to watch this for the
[21:43] perfecting of
[21:45] the saints perfecting is not the same
[21:49] word that is translated in other places
[21:51] as
[21:52] as perfect or which means complete
[21:55] here it's it it it contains part of that
[21:59] but the whole word is complete
[22:01] furnishing

[22:16] you the materials you need to fight
[22:19] in that war so for the perfecting of the
[22:23] saints
[22:25] for what purpose for the work of the
[22:27] ministry
[22:29] so you are called to a ministry the
[22:31] five-fold ministry is to equip
[22:33] the ministry of the church
[22:37] the ministry of you each one of you
[22:41] so that that is the correct
[22:43] understanding
[22:45] and balance of what the purpose of the
[22:48] ministry is and what the purpose of you
[22:50] is revelations 5.
