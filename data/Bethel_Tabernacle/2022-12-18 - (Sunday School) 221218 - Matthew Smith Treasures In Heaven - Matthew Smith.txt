TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign foreign foreign foreign um wanna turn to um Proverbs 22 in verse 3 start off with um wait for there we go um I'm gonna try to go kind of quick because I'm afraid I'm gonna run out of time um it says a prudent man for seeth the evil and hideth himself put the simple pass on and are punished and you all can be seated um so I want to I want to talk a little bit about um maybe as a as a parable um as a type um investment and and sort of money and and things like that um we know brother Brands many times talked about you know God has an economy and and um thing and and whatnot and that how that we would invest in that economy and that there would be there would be Returns on that investment um but I wanted to I wanted to take a story and and maybe tell a little bit of a story and I'm sure it's one that many if not all of you are familiar with because I'm sure many if not all of you have lived through it in some way or another and um that's the story of 2008. um that that story uh the farther you look into it the more I mean use as a human not necessarily looking at it spiritually but just as a person and to and to look at that it really is a head scratcher on how there wasn't a civil war over that um because of the amount of just corruption that happened there was you know you had people who for any of you who aren't really aware of how that whole financial disaster happened effectively you had Banks issuing people mortgages that they knew couldn't be paid back those the people who got the mortgages they were Bad Mortgages that they knew there was no chance those people were ever going to be able to pay that mortgage a lot of times it's because they had effectively lied to the people about what that mortgage entailed um you know they didn't read the fine print or didn't disclose the fine print that you know in three years the mortgage payment was going to go from 900 a month to 7 000 a month um and because and they made that that they sold the people those mortgage because they knew they were going to turn around and sell that mortgage to an investment Bank who isn't going to take that bad mortgage and package it up into a bigger product called the mortgage-backed security where they take thousands of mortgages put them in a big box and sell them to a pension fund because the pension fund says well who doesn't pay their mortgage everybody pays their mortgage this box of several thousand mortgages isn't going to fail and it's going to pay certain percent of interest every year and and people's pensions were backed by this um you had stock people in the stock market who were using these Securities mortgage-backed Securities which were the ratings agencies said were as secure as the federal government AAA couldn't fail and they use those as collateral and invested in the stock market with loans that were backed by as collateral these uh securities well the problem is the Securities were junk nobody knew it but they were junk they were going to fail it was guaranteed it was mathematically guaranteed to fail and yet everybody was resting on this there's huge sex I mean people had had paid 30 40 years into Pension funds and and IRAs and 401ks that were backed by garbage and they had no idea there was no way to know for the average person right and you know for us simple-minded people who you know we're just doing the Dave Ramsey thing and paying into our IRA and and you know doing what we think is prudent we're simple people and yet we get punished for it right because the reality is in a society that is completely eaten up with corruption and when you're paying into an economy and you're investing into economy that has corrupt all the way to its core it's gonna collapse there isn't there isn't a way that's not going to collapse right um and so I wanna you know and we like I said we at the end of all this where you had people who who were in fact we're committing fraud they were outright committing fraud because they were taking these bad Securities you know these Bad Bad Mortgages that they knew were going to fail and they're putting them in Securities they knew were going to fail and then you think well how do they rating agencies put their name on that and say well these are AAA they're as good as As Good As It Gets well it's because they committed fraud outright like that's not a that's not a not conspiracy theory that's just go read the New York Times They openly talk about it they straight up committed fraud and they allowed to they lied to everybody um and at the end of it nobody went to jail nobody nobody there was one guy out of thousands of Bankers they took one guy and threw him under the bus and he got a couple years in the clink and he was doing exactly what everybody else was doing and and not only that not only did nobody go to jail they went to Congress and Congress paid off all their debts all their bad debts on the checkbook of the American people and they still got their bonuses out of American tax dollars and you think wow this is horrifying how did this happen in a previous era if people would have committed that level of theft and that level of fraud they would have been executed like straight up I mean they used to hang horse thieves you think they wouldn't hang people for for defrauding people but we're living in a in an era like and so to the human mind you think well how does this happen how does how does this level of corruption happen and nothing nothing no one is punished there's no recompense there's no justice well this is this is this is Satan's economy what did you expect did you think there would be Justice in Satan's economy right did you think there would be Justice for for those people who who defraud people in Satan's economy there isn't any justice these people nobody's nobody's going to to um to make right exactly and so that's why that's why we take scriptures like Matthew 19-21 where Jesus says lay not up for yourselves treasure upon Earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves Treasures in heaven heaven or neither moth nor rust death corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal nor corrupt Wall Street Executives to fraud you um for where your treasure is there will your heart be also because the problem I mean if you think about it I'm not saying that you shouldn't put money into your retirement fund you should right it's just prudent to do that but if you're putting your spiritual investment into that if that's where your security is and that's where well I'll be all right I'm doing all the right things and I'm I'm and I'm pretty smart guy and I'll I'll depend on my arm of the flesh to make all the right investment moves well you can do that but it's only a matter of time before that thing blows up and you're out on the street right it's only a matter of time before you're gonna need something a little bit more than the arm of the Flesh and so you should be investing in something a little bit more than what you can do um and the other side of that story and this is the kind of the side of the story that maybe less people are familiar with about the 2008 story is there was a very small number of people very small number of people um who were smart enough they were maybe it was just good circumstances but they actually realized what was going on um one guy very famously I'm sure you could all Google them if you've never heard of him by the name of Michael burry um who ran a small really small uh investment firm and he realized that the mortgage-backed security thing was a racket he realized they were all it was a lot of bad debt because he did what somehow nobody else did and just read all the mortgages went I mean most people can't even be bothered to read their own mortgage payment when they sign it when you got a stack of documents as I he read thousands of them and realized that they were all bad and he could predict to within like a couple of months when the entire economy was going to collapse because he knew when all their their terms were going to come due and so he did the unthinkable and he did what he in in sort of Wall Street terms he did what's called shorting the housing market right he went to a bunch of Banks and basically made made up contracts with them um where they would pay him if the Securities failed and they would pay him out to the tune of like 25 times his initial investment right and they were willing to do this because they're like well it's not going to fail they're Triple A rated if these things failed then everything fails they're not going to fail and on top of that he's going to pay us like 75 000 a month for as long as this contract is is good as far as they're concerned I mean he's just offered to pay them 75 000 a month just to donate it to their Bank sure why not right absolutely you know we'll take your money and so he does it he goes to all these different banks and gets all these contracts and he go and by the way of course he he decides to collect coffee cups with their logo on it they have you know sitting on the counter because he wanted a record that these Banks would still exist in 10 years because they weren't going to exist in 10 years and he knew that and the entire time and so he started this in like 2004. and for the next three years he's shelling out thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars every month to keep these to keep into the in into his investment because he knew at some point in 2007 late 2007 it mathematically has to fail and the entire time his investment his investors were freaking out and calling him and saying everybody was calling him insane the banks were calling him crazy and and he had Wall Street guys trying to put pressure on him to sell because they knew what what was going on and they knew he was going to take their shirt but you know so they're trying to put pressure on him to collapse and but he knew his position and he he refused he had to liquidate basically his entire company just to hang on to those contracts but he knew he sold off of everything everything else got sold off right he sold all that he had because he knew there was this one particular pearl of great price that was going to pay out phenomenally at some point but there was a lot of fear uncertainty and doubt that was crushing him and every day he's got to go to work with a knot in his stomach for years for three or four years he has to have faith that he knows that this that the society around him is going to collapse but he's got a way out and Christians can't hold on for like three days right we'll like pray for something and we we know we've invested in God's economy we know we've we've gone Against the Grain we've gone against what society says and like three days of pressure and we're like ah okay fine and we'll just we'll just walk away from our faith this dude is hanging on for like three or four years with people calling him screaming at him saying we're gonna sue you we're gonna throw you in jail and he's like no I'm not gonna sell I'm not gonna I'm not gonna give up and and we're sitting here looking at you know brother bran says you know when what you see in the in the you know the natural types of spiritual this is a lot of different ways we kind of as a shorthand say the natural types of spiritual and like I said previously a lot of times we think oh natural types of spiritual that means the natural is like a metaphor for the spiritual it's not exactly what that means what it means is the natural is a shadow of the spiritual as in what you're seeing in the natural is literally in some way a direct representation of what's happening in the spiritual so when you see in this in in the natural world you see a massive economic collapse on some level this is an indication of on the spiritual world there's a spiritual collapse that's happening and what happened in that same time frame you know you have people because the you know the 2008 collapse happened over the course of like 30 or 40 years it happened very slowly and then very suddenly right it took 30 40 Years of fraud to get to that point and over that same time frame you have this the the social moral collapse of America right and the and the the eight the people that were supposed to be in place who are supposed to call out the fraud you know the rating agencies were in on it and they said you know because afterwards they went to the the people who were supposed to say well why did you rate these AAA they were garbage why did you rate them AAA well they said well because we were getting paid to do it and if we didn't if we didn't rate these what they asked for they would have gone to our competitors well how many churches are going well we can't call out the the nonsense of society because if we do our congregation will go to our competitor and we'll lose our meal ticket you know how and so we've have this massive this massive so like spiritual economy implosion absolute collapse and everybody's wondering well why right why does this why does this collapse you know most people don't understand I I read um I I think that on some level in in the same way you know you have all these these mortgages that people bought that were bad bad debt and it was it's the secret underlying thing that nobody's paying attention to but it's actually the thing that's going to fail right I've on there's a lot of different ways you could kind of approach this but I think I think I like the way Solomon writes this in Ecclesiastes this is Ecclesiastes chapter six one through seven this is a different translation than King James because Ecclesiastes is kind of hard it's kind of clear as mud sometimes because of the translation but um I like this the way that it says this um says there's another evil I have seen under the sun and it weighs heavily upon mankind God gives a man riches wealth and honor so that he lacks nothing his heart desires but God does not allow him to enjoy them instead a stranger will enjoy them this is futile and a grievous affliction a man May father a hundred children and live for many years yet no matter how long he lives if he is unsatisfied with his prosperity and does not even receive a proper burial I say that a stillborn child is better off than he for stillborn child enters in futility into Parts in darkness and his name is shrouded in obscurity the child though neither seeing the son nor knowing anything has more rest than that man even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his Prosperity do not all go to the same place all a man's labor is for his mouth yet his appetite is never satisfied and this is the underlying failure of modern society this is the underlying thing that no modern society is not taking into consideration that they can chase they can chase the world they can chase riches they can chase Fame they can chase whatever it is but if there's no there's no security on the spiritual side there's no they've not invested in anything concrete right they're not invested in anything spiritual they're not invested in their soul they might as well have been stillborn for all the good it's going to do them right if anything the stillborn would have been better because at least they don't got to live 75 years of misery right you know I mean you're gonna you think well this is Satan's Eden well what kind of Eden is Satan going to make nothing that anyone's gonna have a whole lot of fun in not not permanently right you know you think you think uh you know all these people who chase if you're out there chasing chasing um you know a party and a chasing a good time and chasing all this stuff and that's what you live for then what does that say about your life when you're not chasing that but when you don't have that yeah right it means your life is nothing outside of that high right but so I guess what I'm trying to you know in so many words trying to try to present to you is the spiritual investment opportunity of Christ right when when you're gonna when you're gonna short this evil spiritual Society of Satan's Eden that means you have to sell off of everything right if you have any anything that you have that's not invested in in the Kingdom of Heaven is going to burn down so don't have anything invested in that pull out of that cut off all of that invest in the Kingdom of Heaven because that's what's going to pay out at the end of the day and this is the reason why this is such a good investment opportunity folks it pays dividends right when you're invested in a stock that pays dividends that means you get a check every month right it pays you it pays you back well when you invest in the Kingdom of Heaven there's dividends that get paid out right there's healing that gets paid out right brother said that healing Divine Healing is the earnest on your body change right what does that mean it means there's a body change somewhere over there and to prove to you that there is body change he'll change a little bit of your body right now right the same Divine creative power that created a perfect perfect body for you to live in will perfect your body here on some level you know and that and like we said you know the last time I I ministered your spiritual body and your flesh body aren't so different right you have mind battles you have spiritual battles in your mind of depression of anxiety of addiction of of whatever that thing is that you're trying to to free yourself from that thing that's got you got a chain around your neck there's healing for that right there is healing for that but you have to be invested in that economy you can't you know to be invested I had a um a uh where I work as a a maintenance guy property manager um at an apartment complex there were during it was uh I was there while they changed ownership and um the vice president came down to kind of Overlook at the Overlook the property and and one of the things that he told me he's like you know when you if you're gonna actually basically have to Soul guy this property I'm the only person keeping the whole thing floating he's like look if you're going to do this you have to be invested in this it's like I need you to invest like I what they call as emotional buy-in right you have to put a little bit of your emotions on the line for this property because otherwise you're not going to have the motivation to do the hard work that's going to take to do this it's really hard right and if so many times where we don't buy in all the way right well you know we we we're we're afraid that it's gonna it's not gonna work out or something like that or we're looking for a plan B you know it's like well I'll pray about it and if it don't get better I'll just go to the doctor it's like well okay well you should have gone to the doctor first he might have been able to help you because if that's the level of your faith I don't know that your prayer is going to do a whole lot right because you have a plan B your faith is obviously in the doctor otherwise it wouldn't have come up right now you can pray for the the Lord will be with a doctor that's fine right absolutely because that's where your faith is your faith is in the doctor and and we know that the Lord heals through doctors that's I mean the Lord anoints doctors but that I mean so if that's what your faith is that's fine but if you're looking for a miracle then you can't have a plan B right miracles happen for people who don't have options right miracles happen for people who that's what makes it a miracle right if it's if it's and so that's I mean if I could kind of run out of time here um and so I I guess I would would just kind of like to um uh I'll wrap up with with this um you know like I said so many times you have when you have somebody who who sees the sees what's going on like that the man who who held even though everybody was trying to trying to get him to to shake there was a moment where the time frame that he knew everything was going to blow up actually came and all of his investors are like okay man we we we stuck with you until now because you said it was everything was going to fail right here and all the headlines come out and he was right all the headlines that right within those couple months all the headlines come out that all the mortgages are failing but somehow the Securities that those mortgages were packed into didn't fail in fact they went up in price and you're thinking well how does that happen right how did how did they make that work well like I said the secret ingredient was fraud um that's what that's what that's what why that happened it's because the ratings agencies just refused to devalue the the Securities even though they knew beyond any shot of a doubt that they those mortgages were defaulting and so here he is in a time frame where he made a prediction that at this time his his investment was going to pay off but it's not paying off because there was fraud right but he still had to hold on through that and he did he did manage to hold on through it it took a couple months but so many times there's there's with us whatever it is that you're praying for whatever is that you're needing Deliverance for whatever it is that you've invested in you've invested your faith in you've hung on and you said you know no matter how much doubt the devil throws that you've hung on and then you think there's gonna be a moment okay well I'm gonna break through and this is going to be it and then it doesn't happen that's the sticking point that's where you really gotta hold that's where you gotta that's the moment where you gotta go okay the secret ingredient here is fraud right the devil has defrauded me right my faith says that this is going to happen and because it's not happening it's because somebody lied and it's the devil right and so that's when you got to hold through because there's a promise and I want to I and I'll and I'll I'll wrap up with this As Romans 6 15. um and verse 22 and it says but now being made free from sin and become servants to God ye have found your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord and don't forget that even though the entire world has been racking up a massive bill of death right they've been playing with sin and you got to pay the piper eventually because you've you've you've sold off of that off of that market you're not subject to that you there's a there's a gift of eternal life that's waiting for you that has interest now that you have access to and so that's I think we're out of time now we'll stand and have a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we want to thank you for this opportunity that maybe that my jumbled and mixed up words father that would be able to help somebody Lord and it's all I would ask for that if somebody could be helped that they would their faith would maybe hold on a little bit longer whatever it is that they're they're praying for father that whatever they've whatever they've invested their faith in Lord that no matter what kind of lies that the devil would tell them Lord that you would you would carry them through Lord that it would be an encouragement that they would be able to hold on just a little bit longer that that that big payoff Lord is coming that we know that your kingdom is going to be made manifest father so we ask these things in your holy and precious name Jesus Christ amen [Music]
