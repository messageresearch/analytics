perfecting your bride and making us ready for the rapture help us to humbly submit to your word and believe every word of it and say amen to every word of it lord we want you to be glorified in our lives lord we ask these things in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you can stay standing for a few minutes glad to be in the house of god tonight so thankful for his grace i'm going to be speaking on the coming of the son of man tonight taking a teaching on this topic and first scripture is luke 17 and verse 22 just read one verse and he said unto the disciples the days will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and you shall not see it amen may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word he can be seated so i think it was last month and the part of the month before brother jason spoke on the coming of the lord and this is kind of what inspired me to go in that direction i i really enjoyed and appreciated his his ministry on that topic and there's a i was remembering while he was preaching on it some of the points he was making i i think i had heard him speak a special meeting years ago maybe when brother tim pruitt was dedicating the new building i think is when it was and that sermon that i listened to him preach inspired me uh a message that i brought to the saints in uh in turkey and so then just recalling that and then and then brought me back to study a little bit more i have spoken on this topic elsewhere previously but just kind of tweaking things and adding things as as we all grow right we all grow in the lord we all get more revelation from the word i hope we do we should be that's what we're here for amen but looking at it both um looking at it both past tense and then bringing it forward to present tense and so you know we can we can just look back and be so enamored and and impressed and excited about what god has done in the past through brother branham's ministry and we just kind of sit and twiddle our thumbs and and don't enter into what god is doing today and you know some might think that what do you how can you say that what are you talking about that's the message for today it is the message for today it doesn't change but we actually have to grow into that word it's not enough to just say god sent a prophet that's great that's knowing a fact about history god sent a lot of prophets but that doesn't mean that the word of that prophet is living inside of you that just means you're educated enough to read and come to a logical conclusion that's not a supernatural revelation a supernatural revelation it changes you and makes the word live present tense without the word living present tense not in a place that you know about in you not the word living present tense in the pastor in the deacon in your body the word has to live present tense and be manifested in you the bride body of christ is not a bunch of preachers amen it's everybody it's everyone who's been filled with the holy ghost it's not for just the preachers to manifest the presence of christ in this day it's for each of us all right so i want to look at this the token brother branham says we we think the token they say it's just the baptism of the holy ghost it's more than that it's more than just the baptism of the holy ghost the the token himself is here amongst us amen so this is from uh november 28th the token 1963. but the true token of the blood speaking out speaks speaks of a living resurrected presence jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever right living right now among us amen it speaks better from not dead forms and creeds but a living token of a living resurrected christ that lives in us no they deny there is such a thing but we know it's true but we who believe the word know that god promised it and he keeps his promise no it is his living presence for he does as he did that's something more than just your and i baptism of the holy ghost there is a presence of jesus christ dwelling in his people that's different than any other age the fullness of god is here what did brother branham talk about he explained about the logos and he went into the teaching of the logos and the history and how how that logos came forth and he said it's a light begin to form why do you think he was telling that story and he said it that way a light began to form what was it that was appearing in his meetings over and over and over again a supernatural light a pillar of fire what is he trying to say the presence of the very god that created heaven and earth is here amongst the people veiled behind human flesh in 1962 to take on the whole armor of god brother branham says in his army he presents his army in the form of five offices first apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanding officers all with the baptism of the holy ghost waiting out there to to meet the enemy on any grounds he comes upon to meet the enemy with the word of god amen each one backing one another up with him the chief captain not out there in front up here above back back behind but in them that's the army vindicating vindicating what his resurrection by the proof of his works john 14 12 jesus said he that believeth in me the works that i do shall he do also what is it it's god in the church in these five predestinated offices backing up every word that he said with the holy spirit himself in there which is the word made manifest proving his resurrection proving that he lives all other religions are dead their forms are dead there's only one that's right and that's christianity because christ is a living in the church of christ amen making his words manifest free is the same it's the same work it'll do the same thing and show the same works and the same signs amen amen that isn't to say that it's limited he that believe he that believes in me the works that i do shall he do also do you think that brother branham's saying that's only the five-fold ministry it's not look up that look up that terminology or look up john 14 12 and see every single time brother branham talks about it he says any anyone that would believe that word the works that i do shall he do also it's not just one person it's not just the five-fold ministry it's every one of us and what did what did what did he say over and over again such a simple truth but extremely profound and one that should put us on our knees he said if i if if if i have the spirit of jesus christ and living inside of me just like if i had the spirit of john dilliger inside of me i would do the works of john john dillinger i'd be a crook and a murderer but if i have the spirit of jesus christ inside of me i'll do the same works that he did that's part of what he does in us the same works that he did it's not that's not limited to the fivefold ministry only but it sure better be the five-fold ministry having that works in in their lives seeing the spirit of god move this in their lives the same way that that he did in the lord jesus life amen all right so i'm trying to i want you to see it it's it's it's it is past tense through the life of william branham but that word is working present tense in the bride it's a pro it's a process all right i'll leave that there now we're going to go look at look at history so speaking about the coming of the son of man the coming of the lord you look through history the jewish people were waiting for a messiah right they were looking for the messiah to come they believed he would be a man and they believed they had many beliefs based on scriptures about about him and they actually if if you believe it or not they had it all laid out with precision what would happen when messiah would come so if if you've ever read zechariah chapter one at the end of zechariah chapter one it speaks about four horns that scattered israel in other words scattered them throughout the earth away from jerusalem and from the the the territory of israel scattered them throughout the earth right and then it's then it stops about four craftsmen after that and it says the four craftsmen will cast out the power of the four horns which scattered israel so the jewish people say they they in in history and even today they're still waiting for this they believe that there's going to be four messianic figures that appear they believe that elijah will first come then will come messiah the son of joseph who is the suffering servant he will die in a military battle and then you know there's a messiah ben david which is who will ultimately be the king and then the fourth member of that four four um craftsmen is the godly high priest and so they had it all set out exactly you can go study that and it had they had with precision set up how that was going to happen the military battles that would take place they have the all these thank you all these things laid out from scripture and it was scripturally based and it was the orthodox viewpoint this is how it must happen and there was different factions but the majority faction this is how they believed it would happen well when it did happen is that how it happened it was completely contrary to the first coming of christ and so what is my point why am i bringing that up it's because the very same people today have books upon books upon books of how it's going to happen exactly how it's laid out there's movies about it and you know of course you have the dispensationalist view and then you have other views outside of that but the majority view is dispensationalist and so movies and books upon books upon books about it and everybody's looking for it to come in that specific way and it's already taking place and they have no absolutely zero clue of what's happening it was the same in those days they might have known about it roughly but they certainly didn't believe that it could possibly be this man from nazareth could possibly be the messiah we have it all set out how dare these people try to make some interpretation that messiah will come differently god interprets his word by how sending a theologian someone super smart and he knows the parsing of scripture and he knows how to put together the verb tenses of greek hebrew aramaic he knows five languages and boom then we then we have our understanding there's thousands tens of thousands of doctors of theology in the world today and they all bitterly disagree with each other so god has to have a way that he's going to do it how does he do it he brings his word to pass god interprets his own word by bringing it to pass here are some of the prophetic scriptures you try to put it all together in your own mind of course you'll easily do that because it's already fulfilled messiah comes riding on the donkey zechariah 9. messiah comes in the clouds of heaven daniel 7. messiah has wounds in his hands from the house of his friends zechariah 13 isaiah 53 he was wounded for our transgressions messiah's soul will not be left in hell psalm 16 psalm 110 messiah is to sit at the right hand of god and we can go on and on and on this the prophetic scriptures speak of the coming of christ who put that to who put all that together john james matthew luke no god put it together by bringing it to pass all they had to do was know this old testament scripture which they did they studied it they knew it and they just watched what happened in jesus life and they could write down what happened there it is that's fulfilled that's fulfilled that's fulfilled that's fulfilled we know there's a second coming how is god going to fulfill his word the same way he did it before did god did god let the people know did he give them clues about it in the old testament absolutely he did what did they do made their own interpretations and said this is how it must come if it doesn't come this way it's not right it's unscriptural all right so we read the scripture you'll desire to see jesus speaking to his disciples you'll desire to see one of the days of the son of man and you'll not see it and when he speaks of his coming his his revealing of himself he refers to the title son of man the coming of this as it was in the days of noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the day that the son of man is revealed all right so those are the scriptures he's using we're seeing he's saying the son of man what is son of man number one we think of son of man as well that's just a human being he's the son of a man okay that's that's basically what well-paid theologians think about this verse psalm 8 verse 4 what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou vist him what is so god is mindful of man but the son of man he put something different what does he say he visits him isn't that interesting when we when we look at the scripture how many times over and over and over and over again it and the word of the lord came to the prophet and the word of the lord came to the prophet so what is the son of man the word of the lord comes to him god visits god visits the son of man in other words son of man is accompanied this this title is accompanied by the very presence of almighty god he is there he is with them ezekiel is referred to as the son of man by god 90 times ezekiel 2 1 says and he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and i will speak unto thee so son of man what is ezekiel ezekiel is a prophet so what title does god give ezekiel son of man we understand that there is a son of man which is a prophet which is any prophet is a son of man but then there is the son of man and we can only refer to that as being jesus christ so they're looking at son of man you it's a prophetic ministry accompanied by the anointing of the presence of god himself the very logos of god comes to that prophet he visits them ultimately it's a messianic title what does messiah mean anointed one what is a prophet he's an anointed one so again not every language has that terminology the anointed one a anointed one so if you any of you want to preach on this topic in the middle east it's not going to work saying v and a they won't make any sense at all they'll stand and stare at you like i have no idea how to translate that but for us it makes sense and that's what the prophet told us right a son of man revealing the son of man so again we read that verse the days will come you'll desire to see one of the days of the son of man and you shall not see it in other words it's not free it's not for your time of life it's for the future but what is one of the days of days of the son of man interesting terminology isn't it the days of the son of man and it continues on as you read through that the days of lot and the days of noah are both likened unto what in luke the days of the son of man interesting to wait to speak of it so what did they want to see if jesus is speaking and he says you'll want to see one of the days of the son of man what do they want to see his ministry in action right his prophetic ministry that's that's what they've known him right as a healer as someone who tells the thoughts of people's hearts as someone who foretells things that are about to happen so what were they going to want to see we're going to want to see that telling someone's name and their father's name telling someone what happened to them without even being in the same vicinity turning the water in into wine discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart knowing about people's lives in history of their lives discerning diseases and healing they're wanting to see that all right so let's back up even further let's look at deuteronomy 18 verse 15. i'll do a little study of this and a few other verses the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me unto him you shall hearken according to all that thou desirous of the lord thy god and horeb in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of the lord my god neither let me see this great fire any more that i die not and the lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they have spoken i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that i shall command him and it shall come to pass that whoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name i will require it of him so this this series of verses is particularly a pro a prophecy of the messiah the prophet that's going to be like unto moses is speaking of jesus christ but in general it's a principle because what was the principle they said don't speak to us from this great fire anymore we don't want to die we're going to die if you do this so stop that speak through moses and we'll hear him so god says you you said right i will speak through a prophet so there's a there's a principle that this is how god speaks god will speak to us through a prophet and there's this prophecy which is there's going to be a prophet comes that i will raise up and he'll be like moses moses was faithful in all his house he was he was like a steward of the house of god but jesus is a son over that house right if you think if think of hebrews so moses being a steward but jesus being a son over that house he's the he's the lord of that house amen and so continuing on think about think about this more in more detail god appeared to them on that mountain right the the the there was a visible manifestation and a void there was a fire and a voice of words and so the people say cancel cancel that that's going to kill us we're going to die so can you speak to us through moses so now god is actually changing his veil from the pillar of fire to what a man so the prophetic ministry in office is now to become the visible representative and spokesman for god instead of god appearing directly among the people god veils himself behind a man to speak his words through that man to us again the emphasis this is god doing this right we can emphasize on the veil the man and go a million miles wrong we don't want to emphasize on the veil god will do this and this is god speaking the man is there praise the lord for the man we love the man but we don't worship the man we don't obey the man we realize that it's god speaking through the veil amen so this prophet is to speak god's words in his name in other words as you see throughout the old testament thus saith the lord and god will then require it of us to obey the words of the prophet as though it's the very words of god himself the qualifier again the qualifier in the scripture is the prophet speaks in the name of the lord a prophet is a man he speaks many things he does many things we we see that about elijah we see that about in moses but when that prophet said thus saith the lord it was not the prophet speaking it was not his thoughts it wasn't his ideas it wasn't his interpretation it was god speaking and god will require that of us deuteronomy 18 20 but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which i have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that prophet shall die and if thou say in thy heart how shall we know the word which the lord has not spoken oh this is good because you have two people come and say thus saith the lord how shall we know when a prophet speaks speaks in the name of the lord if the thing the word where it says thing there uh in the english that's that word is debar in hebrew which means word if the word follow so follow not nor come to pass so if the word follow not um or come to pass that sounds repetitive right if it doesn't follow or come to pass that's kind of in a way repeating itself in other words it's fulfilled what the prophet spoken is fulfilled that's what it seems like it's saying but in in the hebrew it says if the word is or exists not nor comes to pass in other words it's referring to something that's now something that's future all right so that seems like okay what's the big deal you'll see what the big deal is in a minute that is the thing which the lord has not spoken but the prophet has spoken it presumptually thou shalt not be afraid of him that word where it says afraid it means you shall not assemble yourself together with him so again god speaks a word and that word exists or comes to pass all right present tense in other words you'll see what it you'll see what it is i'm not going to skip ahead bear with me a second get my note straightened out here so so think of it this think of it in this verse this way the prophet will speak of those things that exist what are those things that exist it's the secrets of the heart it's the things that are in people's minds and in their hearts it's knowledge about some something that's in a person's heart or an event that has taken place in their life that the prophet couldn't get in a human through human means it would have to be a supernatural means in the bible you can think of some examples one of that would be i believe it's um elisha correct me if i'm wrong who knows what the king of um syria speaks in his bed chamber right that's the things that are the prophet knowing the thing there's no possibility that's hundreds thousands of miles away from where the prophet is only by the spirit of god could he know that um of course in the ministry of jesus christ it's you know when you meet someone and tells them their name and something about their life so the prophet can speak a prophecy and how would we know if he's speaking the truth to us if you think think about it that way it's a prophecy it's of the future nine times out of ten if you look at prophecies in the scripture you can't tell if it's pr past present or future you sometimes it's very clear and it's easy to understand other times you say i don't even know what he's talking about let alone whether it's come to pass or not it's very mysterious and this can be the case with past prophets or present prophets a thing that a prophet says about the future could be very different than what the literal interpretation of the words that he speaks really is in other words we can't be sure because what is it god interprets his own word so if a prophet foretells sometimes it's very simple other times it can be very mysterious when you're telling about a vision you had and it's all in symbols what does it mean well we all can come up and know of hundreds of interpretations of brother branham's symbolic visions what symbol does it mean well i have my interpretation no my interpretation's right god will bring his interpretation to pass in the season that he wants to bring it to pass and you know what i'm talking about i'll ride this trail one once more the tent vision so on and so forth wonderful things have been spoken about this it's not up to us to bring it to pass it's not up to me to interpret it i need to have a spirit of discernment to know if it's come to pass right but god will let us know god has a way to let us know and it hasn't changed so if god has something more for us then he'd have to just this is god's prayer i'm not saying this is what going to happen but god's principle we should pray and ask god to speak to us and how will he speak to us through a prophet so if god wants to further interpret brother branham's message i think he'll send us another prophet and then god will vindicate that the prophet it's bible principles right but then if we if that were to happen now we have an eighth messenger and we have another prophet and that doesn't work that way does it god has sent his word the prophet is off the scene the message is finished now it's got to get off of the books and the tapes and get into our lives so that we are the living manifestation of that message you are the message that's what the message is the me why are you the message because that word is living itself through you okay so we don't need to interpret brother branham's future prophecies because the same principle that he applied to the biblical prophecies applies to his okay well we don't have to kick each other upside the head with our interpretations of prophecies of brother branham we could just leave them alone and stick with the things that are clear and live a godly life i think that's something brother branham said don't try to interpret it but live a godly life amen so how do we know okay the prophet gives a thousand future prophecies writes them all down how do we know if he's a true prophet should we wait 800 years like isaiah you can't wait 800 years you have to make a decision right now is this a true prophet or not how do we know the things that he speaks now what he says the things that exist if the thing exists not then he's not sent by god amen because the the purpose of this is the prop in the old testament this was about whether the prophet should be put to death or not so if he's going to be put to death we have to know we have to have some knowledge of this we have to have some understanding we don't just do it based on our emotions or feelings if you forward it to the new testament we decide whether we decide that we believe that brother branham's a true prophet or not we have to have some standard it can't be our own emotions it can't be our own feelings it has to be the word of god and brother branham told us to search what he said by the bible over and over and over again but if we examine examine this examine brother branham's ministry the things that he spoke about that exist we see that there's an infallible gift not only do you see that through through reading his messages listening to his messages but you hear that in the testimonies of those who are there with him that saw him discerning the hearts of the people thousands and thousands of times and i want to just for the sake of time look at numbers 12 but i'm not going to read the whole part i want to get to verse six so miriam and aaron spoke against moses because of the ethiopian woman whom he married and because of that they said god didn't only speak through moses he spoke through us too and then the lord came down in the pillar of of cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle and called aaron and miriam forth numbers 12 6 and he said not here now my words if there be a prophet among you i the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream my servant moses is not so who is faithful in all my house with him will i speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches and the similitude of the lord shall he behold wherefore then were you not afraid to speak against my servant moses so here he puts a difference differentiates between a regular prophet and moses he says the regular prophet i will give visions i'll speak to in dreams but with moses i'm not going to do it that way so even even there you see a division between types of prophets remember is saul counted among the prophet prophets well saul wasn't what we would call a major prophet even though that division between major and minor prophets is not actually real all the prophets that we have listed in the old testament and we have their books were major prophets god was working through them in their lives in that age to bring a message to the people for that age and for future times so so someone that has an anointing they can have a vision they can have a dream but moses is different my my he'll look he'll look and see the similitude of the lord in other words the image of the lord the very manifestation of god he'll look and see see it he'll see that and i'll speak to moses face to face so that's something completely different than what god was dealing with moses and aaron yeah you guys i spoke to you in dreams and visions very nice but you should be a little bit more afraid because i don't just speak to moses in dreams and visions i speak to them like we're buddies that's complete something completely different and remember that jesus is a prophet like unto moses so think of it think of it even further as jesus was not only speaking to god face to face he was the face of god he was the visible manifestation of god to us amen the unveiling of god brother branham says moses was the veil the living word of god veiled behind human flesh the pillar of fire was in moses of course speaking what was to be veiled later behind skins you see amen so again this prophetic ministry is to be repeated this that type of prophetic ministry that moses had is to be then repeated how was it repeated it was repeated in jesus christ but then what did jesus say you'll desire to see one of the days of the son of man but you'll not see it so think forward push it forward what the things that i've said and spoken about seeing the image of god manifesting the presence of god veiling god that was done in moses now it was to be repeated there's going to be a prophet like moses jesus christ fulfilled that and now jesus says there's going to be a time on earth called the days of the son of man and during that time what's going to happen you're going to see the coming of the son of man the revealing of the son of man again we we spoke about the identification of the ministry of jesus christ he told them the thoughts and intents of their hearts he told them the secrets of their lives all right that's what the people were looking for he was he was not merely declaring future things right he was declaring the things that were hidden in hearts things that god could only know and soon soon they would desire to see one of those days but it wasn't for them let's look and let's turn there to luke 17 and we're going to look at verse starting at verse 24. now we'll back up we'll start at verse 23 and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them for as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day in other words it's not going to be something that's hidden in some out in some desert place where you have to go to one particular place in order to witness the coming of the son of man it's going to be a worldwide phenomenon but but but first and i want to look at that lightning a little bit closer as we go on but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and as it was in the days of noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man so the days of noah are likened unto the days of the son of man so how long were the days of noah there doesn't have to be an exact parallel but the days of noah was what a period of time 120 years from the time he started building the ark until the until all that process was finished so it's a period of time so why do why does jesus then refer to his well in other places he calls the coming here he refers to it as days the days of the son of man well i thought it was gonna be like lightning and it's gonna just come instantly like that in two seconds how can you have lightning in one verse and the other verse say the days of the son of man maybe lightning is not referring to something that's just instant maybe it's referring to what lightning does but first he must suffer many things as the days of noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed again the days of lot it's a period of time before leading up to the destruction of the world it's not an immediate and instantaneous event like the denominational systems have to have you to believe they believe that the coming of the lord is just that instant the rapture that's it and we meet the lord in the air we go to the marriage supper tribulation period hits and then he comes down to earth at the end of that tribulation period here we see it referred to as a period of time how long we don't know it's been going on a while now hasn't it but how long will it be that these days of the son of man or as it's referred to in matthew the coming of the son of man how long will it be wouldn't you like to know i'd like to know but it'd probably make me live pretty lazy right now and not be going through the things that i need to be going through to get get myself in position for the rapture so it says the the son of man will be revealed that's the word apocalypto which literally means to uncover or unveil the son of man so in other words he's he's hidden from the people and he's going to be unsealed and revealed to the people there will be a time coming when the son of man will be manifested to the world as we saw that verse the lightning it lightens out of one part under heaven and shines to the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day what do you hear brother branham say so many times regarding that verse the same sun that's shown in the east to the jewish people is the same sun that will shine the same lightning that will shine in the west to be revealed to the gentiles but what does lightning do it brings illumination when you're driving down the road and you kind of have open spot which there's not many here in south carolina but if you ever run across that somewhere else and you're driving and there's an open spot and the lightning comes immediately everything is illuminated and you see all the things that are around you that's what the son of man is to do in his day during a period of time when he's being revealed he will bring illumination amen that unveiling itself brings the illumination in a dark age it's the son of man ministry discerning names past events sicknesses healings but beyond that it's the unveiling of the word taking the things that were hidden through the church age opening them up to us so that they're revealed to us in the unveiling of god brother branham says look don't you see it's been veiled through these ages according to what god said and it will be opened in the last days those seven seals would be broken the full thing would come into the interview of the people what's took place all along the hour of the seventh angels message all the mysteries of god should be made known in that elijah this last hour how that christ is put out of the church son of god how he's his revealed as the son of man again how that church is to be put in order and everything for the last day no creed no denomination just absolutely the word living in the individual amen isn't that beautiful the things that were veiled through the ages what did he do he opened those seven seals he broke them open so that the full thing could come into view that was the purpose of that of the message the message that we're feeding on is to make make known all the mysteries of god for us in our day amen first thessalonians 4 16 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first brother branham says this in the rapture message a shout what is the shout now y'all that didn't grow up in the message when you read this or heard it for the first time you were flabbergasted you about fell out of your car or your chair or your couch or whatever you were sitting on when you heard this the first time i know i did i started sweating almost what is he saying this is incredible never heard anything like it in my life those of you that grew up in the message yeah okay let it shock you the shout what is the shout out well it's just a loud noise you know the brother preacher over in germany just says it's a loud noise that happens at the rapture don't pay attention what brother branham said what is the shout it's the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride now next what does brother branham say if you've listened to the rapture message you'll remember but he says now god has a way of doing things and he never changes his policy he never changes his policy he's the unchanging god in amos 3 7 he said he would do nothing on the earth until first he revealed it to his servants the prophets but were promised in the last days according to malachi 4 that there would be a return again a prophet in the land that's right a shout that shout is the message going forth first then that message has to get into a many membered bride and i believe it becomes the voice of the archangel in that bride but it's the same message it's not a new message that message in his people so back up a second what did the verse say the lord himself shall descend from heaven with uh so that means the shout tells us what what happened before that the lord has what descended from heaven uh-oh brother branham you mean that yeah in fact he says in in this sermon when you see god come from heaven and stand before groups of men and stand there and declare himself just as he ever did that's the truth with this bible open well what did you no one saw god come down from heaven right there's one person that saw god come down from heaven the prophet saw saw god come down from heaven but what does the prophet do he explains it to you he's the mouthpiece to say god has failed behind human flesh this is the coming of the lord but it doesn't just stop with that one man isn't that amazing it goes on to a many membered bride but his purpose was to veil god so that we would hear what what the prophet has to say so that we know we're in the phases of the coming of the lord matthew 24 verse 36-39 but of that day an hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only if you're if you remember this was part of the seventh seal brother branham says the the the silence in heaven for the space of half hour is equated to the angels not knowing anything on the the father only but as the days of noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be did we just read that the days of noah and the day and the days of the son of man here a new term is introduced and it says the coming of the son of man for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and knew it and knew not until the flood came and took them all the way so took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be so again a period of time leading up to destruction that's what the days of the son of man is that's what the coming of the son of man is i'm just wanting to grab yeah in 1958 in the sermon that called out brother branham speaking on these verses he says jesus said when the son of man is revealed from heaven let me close by saying this that the son of man is now being revealed from heaven will it come after a while brother branham it is now and i won't i i hope i won't have to make this so personal of this own meeting but that your spirit within you that's given you by god can read what i'm talking about take a deep breath because this should this should make you real for a little bit it's amazing the son of man has already come from glory and is revealing himself for the past few years to his church in mercy showing them his great presence doing the same things that he did when he was here on earth revealing himself like he did to abraham before the destruction he has come now in mercy revealing himself to the church it's being laughed at and scoffed at it still is the next time he reveals itself it'll be in judgment on the world and the nation that's forgot god in sin their way of grace their day of grace rather away because they have forgotten god and they're doing the same thing that they did to the angel of the lord back there mocking and making fun fun of it but he's here now in mercy isn't that beautiful i'm just going to repeat that sentence again because it's so awesome the son of man has already come from glory again step back for a second here's a man who has a ministry and it's unique and it's incredible what god is doing an angel met him just as a observer all right and you're sitting in the audience and you've been there and you've seen him and he's telling the people that come on the platform and then he's telling people in the audience what's going on in their lives telling what they've been praying about that's an incredible thing to think about right there you praying in in secret things that happen i was just listening to a sermon today told a lady what was happening in her bathroom just so you know that it was the lord this happened in your bathroom yes yes yes she says on you can hear it on the tape so that's that's what is happening in front of the people and here he is who should explain what's happening who should be the one that should explain maybe i should come along and give my interpretation of what what god was doing through this ministry no the man that god was working through probably could explain what was happening and i'm telling you this what he's saying here is radical it's a radical departure from anything that anyone has taught will teach it is incredible the son of man has already come from glory and is revealing himself for the past few years to his church in mercy showing them his great presence doing the same things that he did when he was here on earth revealing himself like he did to abraham before the destruction he's come now in mercy revealing himself to the church amen musicians if you'd come would try to close here shortly so when you're listening to the tapes and you're hearing the discernment and what's happening it's not just a discernment it's not just a gift of the spirit it is god himself revealing himself through a prophet it's the coming of the son of man it's the son of man come in mercy revealing himself to his church and so what did god do all those miracles for well let's let the man explain it and the sermon be not afraid 1960 he says we are strangers to one another now that ought to settle it for the whole group of you does that confirm that i'm preaching the truth how would god let me tell something wrong and stand up with my very message these things these things so these things he's saying is he's been discerning people's hearts and lives and praying for them to be delivered says these things are only to indicate a divine vindication that my theology is right that's exactly right the word of the lord come to the prophets so the son of man ministry manifests the presence of god it unveils god and brings that illumination to the elect but then what happens what happens then we have that illumination right we have that illumination from the message so we're just supposed to get really revelated and full of knowledge no that revelation comes why to prepare us for the rapture to make us ready for the rapture the the message that god brought through that man is to make us ready so what should we do we should be preaching it on this pulpit and we should be feeding that on that word on a daily basis don't make it a side dish make it your main course on a daily basis let's stand up heavenly father we're so thankful for the revelation of these things lord you've indicated this message to to let us know that you are here as the prophet said my ministry is different my ministry is to declare him that he's here and now we know lord that your your coming is in phases just like your first coming it took place over a period of time [Music] and now it's taking a place again over a period of time lord and you're continuing to call your elect and reveal yourself to them lord and and so thankful that we can be a part lord not only just be revealed to but we can be we can become as we take that word and feed upon that word we can become the very manifestation of the son of man in this day lord let that word live in us father not just a past tense
