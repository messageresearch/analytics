[23:34] I think I told the booth we're going to
[23:36] begin at verse 25 that' be the best
[23:39] place Hebrews
[23:41] 12 25 you have it say
[23:47] Amen see that ye refuse not him that
[23:52] speaketh for if they escaped not who
[23:55] refused him that spake on Earth much

[24:01] away from him that speaketh from Heaven
[24:04] amen whose voice then shook the Earth
[24:07] but now he hath promised saying yet once
[24:11] more I shake not the Earth only but also
[24:15] heaven and this word yet once more
[24:18] signifieth the removing of those things
[24:20] that are shaken as of things that are
[24:23] made that those things which cannot be
[24:26] shaken May remain
[24:29] amen so when when the world is finished
[24:33] shaken only God's family will be left
[24:36] standing amen wherefore we receive a
[24:40] kingdom which cannot be moved thank God
[24:44] let us have Grace whereby we may serve
[24:48] God
[24:49] acceptably with reverence and godly fear
[24:53] for our God is a consuming fire I can
[24:58] tell he wants all of
[25:00] you and he'll either you'll either allow
[25:04] him to be Lord of all or he is not going
[25:07] to be willing to be Lord at all and uh
[25:10] you know I was just listening um before
[25:13] coming to church and sister Debbie and I
[25:15] were listening to a tape there and that
[25:17] I'm using tonight in this sermon number
[25:20] of statements from IT world falling
[25:22] apart where brother brandham said you've
[25:25] got to meet his conditions if you want
[25:27] him to meet your needs so you can't
[25:30] expect him to just you know you've heard
[25:33] me say before he ain't a vending
[25:36] machine right he's not Santa Claus see
[25:39] so it's not you know get in a crisis
[25:41] drop few quarters and say Lord I need
[25:44] some Deliverance if you I I first of all
[25:47] I want more than 75 cent worth of
[25:49] Deliverance I want I want I'm I'm like
[25:52] Ruth I don't want just a few handfuls I
[25:54] want the whole field I want all the
[25:57] possession amen
[25:59] so I'm certainly uh greedy in that way
[26:02] and uh I want everything that the Lord
[26:05] has for me amen let's bow our heads
[26:08] father we thank you for this service
[26:12] tonight and I ask for your divine
[26:14] blessing Lord as I just have spent Lord
[26:18] the entire day pondering this thought
[26:21] and Lord and putting it together in my
[26:24] mind and walking it through the
[26:27] scriptures and the things your Prophet
[26:29] said Lord we want to be sure that we
[26:32] have your exact mind for tonight uh so
[26:35] Lord I just commit myself into your
[26:38] hands right readily right now and ask
[26:40] you to take complete control of the
[26:42] service and I will just rest in that
[26:45] Assurance commit it to you in Jesus name
[26:49] amen God bless you friends you can be
[26:50] seated
[27:09] amen and
[27:10] amen excuse me and get all my uh ducks
[27:14] in a row here get everybody
[27:18] cooperating
[27:20] amen
[27:22] [Music]
[27:23] tonight I'm going to deviate from my
[27:28] series that I thought all week that I
[27:30] would probably get back to um but uh
[27:35] yesterday what are you doing machine
[27:39] yesterday um it was either yesterday or
[27:41] the day before very early in the morning
[27:44] the Lord dropped a a different thought
[27:46] in my heart and I I'm I'm I'm calling it
[27:52] competing Powers
[27:55] now I almost decided to call it a false
[27:59] Messiah but I figured with the events of
[28:02] of last night and today that would be
[28:04] like clickbait so I decided not to get
[28:07] accused of using a title uh that would
[28:10] be clickbait for U um people watching on
[28:13] YouTube and plus you'd think if I did
[28:16] that you'd think that I was going to
[28:17] preach on the Donald tonight but I'm not
[28:23] I'm not actually at all um I'm I'm going
[28:26] to
[28:28] use the events because they are epic
[28:31] events of what happened last night as a
[28:34] as a side note or more as what they
[28:36] would call a footnote but I got this
[28:38] burden before a day and a half maybe at
[28:41] least before anyone knew the outcome of
[28:44] any kind of election and it was uh down
[28:47] to the wires what they were saying it
[28:49] would be it would be very close it ended
[28:51] up not being and I think that's
[28:54] providential as well so the last thing
[28:57] that I'm interested in doing tonight is
[28:59] stepping up and and giving a political
[29:02] speech amen we're here for the word of
[29:04] God so but but it does bring us to a
[29:09] reality of competing powers in this day
[29:13] now let me kind of cut to the chase a
[29:16] little bit and take you into the message
[29:20] that brother brandom said and this might
[29:22] be getting ahead of myself it's okay
[29:23] it's the way I feel led to do it brother
[29:25] brandham comes just um uh later on in
[29:29] 1963 after he's preached the seals and
[29:31] some very uh amazing sermons and he
[29:35] comes to the
[29:36] end of
[29:38] 1963 just like we're coming to the end
[29:40] of 2024 hard to believe but he preaches
[29:44] a message called the
[29:46] world is falling apart later on he would
[29:49] take the message the world is again
[29:51] falling apart so obviously the Lord had
[29:55] quite a bit in these sermons that that
[29:58] we needed to get our minds around and in
[30:03] the first his first run with it in the
[30:05] world is falling apart in November the
[30:09] 15th uh
[30:11] 1963 brother brandham actually will
[30:16] contrast Alexander the Great with the
[30:21] Lord Jesus Christ amen and he will point
[30:24] out how in that sermon how that and you
[30:28] understand now why I'm starting with
[30:30] this because I remember my title is
[30:33] competing Powers all right and so he he
[30:37] contrast how that Alexander was a great
[30:40] you know lived uh many many years prior
[30:44] many centuries you know prior uh to
[30:48] Christ coming on the scene this was the
[30:50] the beginning of the rise of the Grecian
[30:52] Empire it would be many centuries later
[30:55] before that would diminish and the Roman
[30:57] EMP Empire would come on the scene who
[31:00] were in power at the time of the Lord
[31:03] Jesus amen and so we find then that many
[31:07] centuries separated their lives but
[31:10] brother brandham draws a contrast
[31:12] between both of them as conquerors yeah
[31:17] amen and ironically or not so much
[31:20] ironically because personally and this
[31:22] is just brother Jason I I wonder if the
[31:26] Lord didn't do it exactly on purpose uh
[31:29] to to show exactly the contrast between
[31:33] a World Conqueror who would who would
[31:37] start out his life as a
[31:40] prohibitionist but then who would become
[31:43] decadent in his power because when you
[31:45] have absolute power but you have no
[31:48] character that becomes evil that's a
[31:50] recipe for evil and so we realize then
[31:53] that when you when you take you can look
[31:56] down through history every despot that
[31:59] ever lived every Tyrant that every live
[32:01] that ever lived gained tremendous power
[32:05] but had no character and so it becomes
[32:08] satanic in other words not the person
[32:11] becomes Satan but that person leans into
[32:15] uh the the Fallen nature that they're
[32:18] born with and Satan ends up with all of
[32:20] that power Satan ends up with
[32:24] it see now I want you to understand a
[32:26] great principle that we would not have
[32:28] known had had brother brandham not given
[32:31] us this insider trading knowledge this
[32:33] top secret spiritual military uh inside
[32:38] knowledge and that is this and the devil
[32:40] didn't want anyone to know it but a
[32:42] prophet declared it and put it on a tape
[32:43] and I heard it amen prise God and now it
[32:46] can't be taken back that's right and he
[32:48] says this that a demon is almost
[32:52] powerless unless he can find somebody to
[32:56] work through see so a demon all by
[32:59] himself although he has brother brandom
[33:02] talks about how that Satan conjured up
[33:04] that storm he is the prince of the power
[33:05] of the air don't imagine he doesn't have
[33:07] any power he's got real power brother
[33:10] bradam when he was there in that big
[33:12] tent meeting and those witch doctors
[33:14] came in and he said they sat down and
[33:16] they began turning their cutting their
[33:18] feathers and turning them and saying
[33:20] father son Holy Ghost father son and
[33:23] actually using Three Holy words a as it
[33:27] were uh from the word of God and
[33:30] Conjuring a storm said we'll conjure a
[33:32] storm that'll blow this tent away and
[33:34] brother brandham said believe it or not
[33:36] the storm came yeah just like Jesus
[33:39] asleep in the boat and the demons swore
[33:42] this is our chance let's kill him and so
[33:44] they begin to stir the winds and the
[33:46] waves so it's not that Satan doesn't
[33:49] have any power say but I thought Jesus
[33:52] stripped him of all of his power
[33:54] understand that that Satan is equal to
[33:57] Christ except in creation what he's
[34:01] lacking is authority over
[34:05] you amen so he is in effect powerless
[34:10] unless you give him
[34:12] Authority so his only weapon against you
[34:16] not the world look it's obvious that
[34:18] he's the God of this evil age by the
[34:21] popular demand long before any
[34:23] politician won a vote Satan had already
[34:26] won the vote of the population of the
[34:28] Earth and he's now worshiped as the god
[34:31] of the
[34:32] age and so we realize then that that he
[34:36] doesn't he doesn't have any authority
[34:39] over you and I everything that all of
[34:41] his interaction with God's family
[34:44] anything that we go through as we've
[34:45] said before Satan must get permission
[34:48] from our heavenly father but now
[34:50] remember there's also the side of this
[34:53] that he might come to you and say you
[34:56] know I need you know you should do this
[34:58] and tempt you to do it and you might do
[35:01] it and then try to say the devil made me
[35:04] do it and brother brandham says no right
[35:08] he never because you were sealed into
[35:10] Christ and he couldn't get to you he
[35:12] said you stepped out to
[35:14] himen you stopped and listened to
[35:17] reasoning and then because you became a
[35:20] participant a co conspirator then you
[35:23] say well why did the Lord let me get
[35:25] punished I'm here to tell you you
[35:27] brought it on
[35:28] yourself see so when your when things
[35:31] like your prayer life your church
[35:33] attendance your fellowship when those
[35:34] things wne and the devil is able to use
[35:37] his very simple tactic it's astonishing
[35:41] how much success he has with this over
[35:43] God's family he uses a very simple out
[35:47] of the-box tactic called
[35:49] distraction and he just fills up your
[35:52] life with distraction oh yeah amen and
[35:54] he'll fill up your life with digital
[35:56] distraction and career distractions and
[35:58] and and entertainment distractions and
[36:01] Recreation distractions and and any one
[36:04] of them or all of them and and we just
[36:07] almost like the the children who
[36:09] followed the P Piper we just like follow
[36:11] along like we're hypnotized and then we
[36:13] come to our senses and we go oh Lord
[36:16] Jesus forgive me and he will because if
[36:19] we confess our sins he's faithful and
[36:21] just to forgive us amen but we
[36:24] understand that we bring so many
[36:26] consequences that maybe God didn't have
[36:29] planned for you he's aware of it and he
[36:33] will help you in your time of need but
[36:35] come on can we just own our own
[36:37] involvement sometimes friends that this
[36:40] whole power struggle you know is is
[36:43] really as brother brandham said it's
[36:45] it's for it's God and Satan vying for
[36:48] control of your mind amen cuz if Satan
[36:52] can control your mind he can control
[36:54] your actions control the minds of the of
[36:57] the people you'll control their actions
[36:58] that's a well-known uh
[37:02] trick that governments use and
[37:05] politicians use win the hearts and minds
[37:07] of the people where you think that came
[37:09] from amen see God's design is to win
[37:13] your hearts and Minds Satan's design is
[37:16] to win your hearts and Minds we go into
[37:19] an we go into an enemy Nation we what
[37:22] are we trying to do win their hearts and
[37:23] Minds only we go about it wrong instead
[37:26] of bringing them the the gospel that
[37:28] could really change their nature we just
[37:29] give them money and all kinds of things
[37:31] and they end up hating us even
[37:33] more
[37:35] right so brother brandham talks about
[37:38] how that Alexander You Know by the time
[37:42] he's 33 he's an
[37:44] alcoholic there's history records about
[37:47] 7 to 8,000 probably I think brother Bram
[37:50] used the the word the the the number
[37:52] 7,000 that's pretty close historically
[37:56] uh it's there it's somewhat subjective
[37:58] I'll take it but there were 7,000
[38:01] prostitutes following his army right
[38:04] right this was one of the things that
[38:06] Jon of Arc you know got rid of you know
[38:09] when she was being used for God used by
[38:12] God in France she said we've got to get
[38:14] rid of these things it's the only way we
[38:16] can have the blessing of God and and she
[38:18] wasn't wrong so so we find then that by
[38:22] the time he's
[38:24] 33 he has conquered the known world
[38:28] conquered everything that they knew
[38:29] about that was worth anything there was
[38:31] still lands they know he wasn't on on he
[38:34] wasn't in North America wasn't even know
[38:36] understood you know by his armies but
[38:39] everything that was worth conquering he
[38:41] had conquered and then he died at
[38:45] 33
[38:47] Conquering the known world that had any
[38:51] value but the contrast was that Jesus
[38:55] look here's here's the thing to get they
[38:58] both died at
[39:01] 33 and one of them is still
[39:04] dead but one of them came back to life
[39:08] and when he ascended on high he
[39:10] conquered death hell the grave Heaven
[39:13] Earth the universe he conquered
[39:16] everything at 33 I'll take that
[39:20] leader to
[39:22] me that power has already conquered my
[39:25] heart and my mind I hope you're here
[39:27] tonight and you're not still playing the
[39:29] the game of of of competing Powers I
[39:32] want to tell you something today don't
[39:34] don't don't give don't let this be a
[39:36] competition give your whole heart and
[39:38] mind to the Conqueror who conquered
[39:41] everything is still alive and is still
[39:45] in
[39:53] control brother brandham and here is
[39:58] where I'm trying to come down now to I
[40:01] want to try to go quickly because it's a
[40:04] Wednesday
[40:06] and brother brandham talks about it in a
[40:08] number of places he says here and this
[40:12] is a little sooner than a little before
[40:15] a few months before the world falling
[40:16] apart this is in July of 63 and I've
[40:20] only got some highlighted Spots I'm
[40:22] going to read that's why I didn't put
[40:23] them up because I didn't want to get
[40:24] slowed down with with whole quotes but I
[40:26] just want to read some
[40:29] Snippets brother brandham says we are at
[40:32] the end
[40:34] time there is not one hope left now this
[40:39] is by this is just July
[40:43] 1963 amen and we know that
[40:48] 1956 ended the call to America and by
[40:52] the time the sun rose on January 1 1957
[40:57] America as a nation had rejected God and
[41:01] crossed the line and judgment was
[41:03] pronounced upon her and she has declined
[41:06] ever since
[41:07] amen now it's not about oh well her GDP
[41:11] is up her Army has conquered this it's
[41:13] not about that like brother brandham
[41:14] said sure he said anytime you denominate
[41:17] said the Holy Spirit leaves it God puts
[41:20] it on a shelf and he said and he said
[41:22] and then I'll ask any historian show me
[41:25] any church that ever denominated if it
[41:28] didn't die right there but then he
[41:30] concedes the fact because it's a
[41:32] pointless fact he says you say oh well
[41:36] but we've increased our numbers he said
[41:38] sure of course you've increased your
[41:40] numbers that's not the point you could
[41:42] quadruple you could go grow 10 times a
[41:45] 100 times over your numbers but if God
[41:48] has left that organization then all you
[41:51] have is dead
[41:52] people and and worse than dead you have
[41:55] no way to bring red Redemption because
[41:58] the light that brings Redemption has
[42:00] already moved on and the only hope that
[42:03] anyone has in that past movement is to
[42:06] hear the draw is to let the sunlight
[42:08] draw them out of there and follow after
[42:11] the light just like you your brother M
[42:14] says you pour concrete over it and the
[42:16] grass will grow out sideways and come up
[42:18] along the edges no matter what you do
[42:20] it's reaching up for the
[42:23] Sun and in every age and including this
[42:26] age there was a number of people in a
[42:28] dark day who the sun rose and they have
[42:31] ever since that day been reaching up for
[42:34] the sun I'm reaching up for it tonight
[42:37] friends I don't want to live one day
[42:39] without it the warmth of its raise it's
[42:43] life-giving
[42:46] raise so he's already
[42:50] declaring we're at the end time there is
[42:53] not one hope
[42:55] left we cannot build bu Upon This Nation
[42:59] this nation is based on
[43:02] politics politics is finished yes
[43:07] amen half the nation is having a big
[43:11] Jubilee party yeah the other half of the
[43:14] half the nation is is in their whiskey
[43:17] celebrating another half is in their
[43:19] whiskey
[43:22] crying what a miserable State of Affairs
[43:26] the this world is not my home I'm just
[43:29] passing through
[43:33] Hallelujah politics is finished
[43:37] yes he says on here in the world falling
[43:40] apart every so often the world gets in
[43:45] such a chaotic condition until there is
[43:49] this is a strong statement until there
[43:51] is nothing can help it yeah amen it's
[43:55] already gone so now won't at this point
[43:58] now we're not talking about what God can
[44:00] do because God has already it's already
[44:04] crossed a line for God to help it so now
[44:08] all it's got is its science and its
[44:10] politics it's government and its Army
[44:12] and its money suppose
[44:14] it so so he says and the and the and the
[44:18] truth of it is and history proves it
[44:22] once it goes beyond God's mercy then
[44:25] nothing can help it and it'll just
[44:27] Decline and Decline and
[44:29] Decline and so he says we've had that
[44:32] this several times these preludes he
[44:34] calls them we find that each time when
[44:38] it meets this condition and it causes
[44:40] people to start praying and they feel
[44:43] that everything has played itself out
[44:46] and all of our systems and everything
[44:48] that we have play itself to the
[44:53] end politics and other things things
[44:58] just comes to its end there is no more
[45:02] to it and I think all that's done by God
[45:06] he says and I think all that's done by
[45:09] God for a purpose to kind of rejuvenate
[45:14] a kind of bringing back it has a way of
[45:17] renewing itself now civilization has
[45:21] done that down through time one
[45:23] civilization Rises up and then it fades
[45:25] out in another one replaces it the the
[45:28] bottom line is people Humanity has
[45:30] managed to just keep finding new
[45:32] civilizations they've managed to just
[45:34] get new countries they managed to just
[45:36] keep going and the whole thing has
[45:38] become Global and and the world thinks
[45:40] well we've survived you know world wars
[45:42] we've survived everything looks like
[45:44] we're we we all we've got to do is try
[45:46] to build a secure future but what they
[45:49] don't realize is is that the last Nation
[45:52] all of those the reason it kept going
[45:54] forward is because it had to get to the
[45:56] last Nation the sun had to get all the
[45:59] way to the to the west and that has
[46:01] happened and now that nation has
[46:03] rejected it now there's no more Super
[46:06] Nations to
[46:10] come there is a
[46:12] superpower but it ain't a
[46:15] nation see certainly not politics in the
[46:19] traditional
[46:21] sense so he he goes on to
[46:24] say everything has just played itself to
[46:28] the
[46:28] end politics and other things just come
[46:31] to its end it's kind of a re a
[46:33] rejuvenating a renewing of itself and he
[46:36] says it like this it's just a law of God
[46:39] see amen so brother brother Matt has
[46:42] preached uh there from the uh Church age
[46:45] book about the you know the whole thing
[46:48] of of Revival and death and that cycle
[46:50] of Revival and death and we've seen it
[46:52] go all the way down through time brother
[46:55] brandham comes into this day the
[46:57] scripture is fulfilled now this is 1965
[47:00] I'm jumping near to the end of his
[47:02] ministry and he says Jesus referring
[47:05] back to the day that we are living in
[47:07] right now this day right now see rich
[47:11] leoda and yet rotten in politics yes
[47:16] Church politics amen see National
[47:19] politics amen just as rotten as it could
[47:22] be and then he said as it was in the
[47:26] days of thought so shall it be in the
[47:29] coming end time notice what he said
[47:31] there in the day when the son of man
[47:33] will be revealed now we have the son of
[47:35] man the day of the son of man revealed
[47:37] again th this is exactly why I was so
[47:40] appreciating brother brother Joe Adams
[47:42] sermon from Sunday because he he took
[47:45] such such pains and cares and time to
[47:49] explain how that you know that he said
[47:52] we're not talking about isua get isua
[47:54] out of your mind he said when we say
[47:56] we're going back to Pentecost we're not
[47:58] talking about isua that was just one of
[48:01] a four-stage plan that God had to
[48:03] restore the brid tree there was
[48:05] justification sanctification the isua
[48:07] Revival which brother Ram said just
[48:09] brought a little more power that was
[48:10] missing in the church and it it it amped
[48:13] things up and some gifts started to flow
[48:15] again and some more power started to
[48:17] turn loose it was not the long awaited
[48:19] restoration that would put fruit in the
[48:21] top of the tree because because it
[48:24] proved it wasn't CZ it denominated just
[48:27] like Luther did just like Wesley did the
[48:29] Asuza fathers denominated so when
[48:31] brother brandham says that you can't mix
[48:34] Pentecost with this message he's
[48:37] certainly not talking about the upper
[48:40] room
[48:42] experience he's talking about what the
[48:45] azuza Revival
[48:47] became and that's true you can't mix
[48:51] because it denominated and that's
[48:53] exactly why people have tried people who
[48:56] claim the message people who preach the
[48:58] message and have had denominational
[49:01] spirits and you can't mix that kind of a
[49:04] spirit with the message cuz it's not a
[49:06] dead letter it's a living
[49:09] God it's a person of Christ the the
[49:12] message has is not and has never been
[49:15] books and tapes and quotes that's just a
[49:17] vehicle that God used but the message is
[49:19] a person of the word it's Christ now
[49:22] living inside of his
[49:24] people and brother brandham talks about
[49:27] how that that's why this is a
[49:29] restoration as brother Joe would say he
[49:32] said Sunday people say oh we have the
[49:36] revealed
[49:38] word don't lose sight of the fact please
[49:43] that the re that the
[49:45] Revelation the revealed word the
[49:48] Revelation that we have is a restored
[49:53] word that it has restored us back to the
[49:56] original faith of the fathers it has
[49:59] taken us back that's why brother
[50:00] brandham said that first age that Alpha
[50:03] age they had the Jubilee they had the
[50:05] abstract title they had that was the
[50:07] token was there that was the
[50:09] continuation of the ministry of Jesus
[50:13] Christ where they had not only the
[50:16] office of a son of man like we had in
[50:18] our day but they had the ministry of the
[50:20] son of man because an office is a
[50:22] prophet but the ministry is the word
[50:23] made flesh and that's where brother Bram
[50:25] says it was once again the word like in
[50:28] Christ in one man walking the shores of
[50:30] Galilee now the word was made flesh in
[50:33] an entire body on the earth starting at
[50:35] Jerusalem and moving out to Judea and
[50:37] Samaria and to the uttermost part of the
[50:39] earth and then that went down in the
[50:41] ages and has been brought back in this
[50:44] hour and so we've been restored back to
[50:47] the original faith of the fathers that's
[50:50] a perfect Faith because that's the mind
[50:51] of
[50:54] Christ see
[50:57] so so we find in that the fact that here
[51:01] we
[51:02] are with the restored word that's been
[51:07] revealed in this day and that's why
[51:11] that's why only the bride can see it
[51:13] because the the the the rest of the
[51:16] world outside of election can only
[51:19] believe what they
[51:21] read and can study a student comparing
[51:25] verse with verse but the bride the elect
[51:28] lady is not limited by what she can read
[51:32] and understand in reading or Scholastics
[51:36] but but to her she while the world
[51:39] understands what it can read the bride
[51:41] understands what has been revealed so
[51:43] it's not just something you read but
[51:45] something got revealed to
[51:47] [Applause]
[51:49] you you say well how do you know that it
[51:52] was the word revealed because it turns
[51:54] the reader and the believer and the
[51:57] person revealed into the image of this
[52:03] book it causes you to love God it causes
[52:06] you to hate sin it causes you to re say
[52:08] Amen to every word and not try to second
[52:10] guess it it causes you to not only
[52:13] receive but to accept and pursue the
[52:16] power and demonstration of the Holy
[52:20] Ghost
[52:21] amen so he goes on in the anointed ones
[52:24] at the end time
[52:28] he says he says he says here and he
[52:31] reads the scripture there from from the
[52:33] gospels for there shall
[52:35] arise Matthew 24 false
[52:38] Christ and false prophets talking about
[52:40] at the very last day and he says a
[52:44] Believer knows that we are now at the
[52:48] end of the history of the world Amen say
[52:53] well goodness that was 70 years ago that
[52:55] a that's just minutes and seconds to God
[52:59] that's nothing see we've been here 2,000
[53:02] years Einstein proved that difference in
[53:03] time relativity see and so to to what
[53:07] has been two 20 centuries to us to God
[53:09] just a couple days see so we're told
[53:14] that in the last days and brother
[53:17] Brandon would say the last 2,000 years
[53:20] he says now believer a Believer knows
[53:22] that we are now at the end of the
[53:24] history of the world there will be no
[53:27] use of writing it didn't say they
[53:29] wouldn't just said it ain't going to
[53:30] serve a lot of purpose there' be no use
[53:32] of writing it because there won't be
[53:34] anybody to read it it's at the end of
[53:37] the time just when I do not know just
[53:41] how long it would be not even the angels
[53:43] of heaven knows that minute or that
[53:47] hour so he's talking about politics have
[53:50] come to their end this is
[53:53] 1960s society's at an end history is at
[53:56] an end now I I I I came across an
[54:01] article by a a very astute woman very
[54:05] smart actually I'm I subscribed to her
[54:07] Channel because of my fascination with
[54:09] physics and science but her name of
[54:12] course is Sabine hossenfelder she's
[54:15] wellknown she's a theoretical physicist
[54:18] she's a science Communicator she
[54:20] explores the role most often of of
[54:23] aesthetic criteria in the development of
[54:25] physical theories and argues and here's
[54:27] her main
[54:29] argument that that
[54:32] because that physics and I'm just going
[54:34] to give you the the short version it's a
[54:36] whole book she wrote a fantastic book
[54:39] called Lost in the math and she has many
[54:42] YouTube um about this she's held in some
[54:45] derision by physicists because she they
[54:48] don't want her telling what she's
[54:49] telling but she's a brilliant woman
[54:51] she's
[54:52] German and and um she says
[54:56] that that physics has just done nothing
[55:02] in the last 50
[55:05] years that caught my attention because I
[55:07] remembered brother brandham saying
[55:09] science has come to its end politics
[55:11] come to its end the Earth's come to its
[55:13] end and here she's admitting that we've
[55:16] done nothing she says now oh I know
[55:18] you're going to say well we've developed
[55:20] string theory and we've developed chaos
[55:22] and we've developed you know um all you
[55:25] know all of these different positions
[55:27] and and all kinds of quantum physics she
[55:29] said yeah yeah yeah yeah that's true she
[55:32] says but it's all just beautiful
[55:36] Theory she said we we haven't we haven't
[55:40] substantially proven any of it right in
[55:44] the last half century amen
[55:47] wow and it it caught my mind because I
[55:50] remember it's like for instance you can
[55:52] take today one of our great minds is
[55:55] Elon Musk and his goal is a moon colony
[55:59] and then on to
[56:00] Mars now you say Do you think that can
[56:03] happen I do not the reason I do not do
[56:06] do I think they could eventually do that
[56:08] absolutely but from the Tree of
[56:09] knowledge of Good and Evil if they
[56:11] didn't run out of time just like brother
[56:13] Brenham says Luther would have came to
[56:14] this message but he died he ran out of
[56:17] time he couldn't he didn't live long
[56:19] enough Wesley would have become it but
[56:21] he didn't live long enough you see so
[56:23] they will but they won't live long
[56:25] enough because we've already reached the
[56:27] end of Politics the end of history and
[56:29] now even top physicists are saying we
[56:32] really reached the end of of scientific
[56:34] development and we've done nothing but
[56:36] guess at
[56:38] things amen and and and another thing
[56:41] and and when I think about musk saying
[56:44] oh we're going to have a moon Colony
[56:45] we're going to go to Mars when I look
[56:48] back at a prophet's seven
[56:50] visions and they covered different
[56:53] things they covered social trends they
[56:54] covered politics they covered you know
[56:57] the the the women and the and the and
[56:59] the morals and things like that they
[57:00] covered World War and different nations
[57:03] and powers and brother bram's prophecies
[57:06] have just hit with stunning accuracy
[57:09] Amen to the to the Limit that the only
[57:12] one remaining unfulfilled is he said I
[57:15] heard a terrific explosion and I turned
[57:17] and as far as I could see across the
[57:19] landscape of America just smoldering
[57:22] debris and ruin and blown to Pieces yes
[57:24] amen and you say well what is that going
[57:27] to be anything it would be as
[57:28] speculative and and I'll just say I
[57:31] don't know but that's okay cuz I plan to
[57:33] be somewhere
[57:35] else lot's children have to deal with
[57:37] that not Abraham's children I know that
[57:40] when we come back we walk out on the
[57:42] ashes of the wicked and that seems to be
[57:45] what brother Brenham saw just ashes just
[57:47] smoldering said as far as I could see
[57:50] just nothing but blown up places and
[57:53] smoking and and just like there had been
[57:55] a TR terrific and we preached here some
[57:57] time ago you know on just the
[57:59] destructive power of a one Megaton
[58:01] nuclear bomb and it took our breath away
[58:05] the destructive power of just one just a
[58:08] one Megaton and so so we when when I
[58:12] look at all of his categories one of the
[58:15] categories he dealt with was science
[58:18] yeah and and invention and the last
[58:21] thing he saw in the in the progression
[58:24] of scientific achievement was the
[58:26] driverless
[58:28] car that had no steering wheel and going
[58:30] down super highways under its own power
[58:33] we I mean and they've had that car and
[58:35] that whole concept for decades but now
[58:38] you are living in the days of the
[58:40] implementation of that yeah amen and
[58:43] we're literally they've already got I
[58:44] was just in Phoenix it shocked me I'd
[58:46] heard that Phoenix was one of the big
[58:47] cities of weo and everywhere I go
[58:50] there's wayo Cars Moving and no no
[58:52] driver in it and they're and they're now
[58:55] releasing in cars that have no steering
[58:57] wheel and you just get in it and the
[58:59] family faces each other exactly
[59:01] according to brother Brandon's Vision he
[59:03] didn't see Moon colonies and he didn't
[59:05] see us getting to Mars he saw what we
[59:07] are seeing right now I'm here to tell
[59:10] you look up because your Redemption draw
[59:16] n and in fact as I saw another article
[59:19] just
[59:20] today and and and I I don't know if I'm
[59:23] pronouncing this right but it's it's uh
[59:26] uh
[59:28] parthenogenesis and it's actually they
[59:30] now have this article because now
[59:32] they're forced to discuss the ethical
[59:34] and scientific question surrounding the
[59:37] creation of human embryos without the
[59:40] use of of of egg or sperm from the man
[59:43] or the woman that it's
[59:46] completely uh generated from stem cells
[59:49] alone and and so now there's this big
[59:52] ethical question well is that a human
[59:54] and it's actually the cell is developing
[59:57] DNA and starting to develop and they're
[59:59] they're stopping it because they say if
[1:00:01] this grows into a person and and they
[1:00:04] make it very clear we're not we're not
[1:00:06] trying to grow a baby we're just trying
[1:00:09] to understand creation and life I'm here
[1:00:11] to tell you they've reached the maximum
[1:00:14] and your Redemption is soon friends
[1:00:16] science is admitting they have not
[1:00:19] actually been developing they've got
[1:00:21] theories and you know the thing that
[1:00:23] that that that Sabine points out in this
[1:00:26] caught my mind she said the
[1:00:29] reason that the scientific community in
[1:00:32] in physics has
[1:00:35] stalled with definitive proof of all of
[1:00:38] these theories is because these theories
[1:00:41] have been focused on
[1:00:44] beauty and it's all mathematical Beauty
[1:00:48] and they want to make it so so eloquent
[1:00:51] and so elaborate and oh it's just
[1:00:53] beautiful and they get mesmerized cuz
[1:00:55] they can line it all up mathematically
[1:00:57] and it's a beautiful thing and I thought
[1:00:59] to myself that's exactly what Cain did
[1:01:01] he went after Beauty that's exactly what
[1:01:03] brother bradam said the problem was with
[1:01:04] the churches they want Beauty Satan
[1:01:07] lives in Beauty and it has and that's
[1:01:10] why politics has come to an end that's
[1:01:12] why science is maxed out that's why
[1:01:14] we're almost home I'm here to tell you
[1:01:16] something friends don't bother writing
[1:01:18] history books there won't be soon anyone
[1:01:20] to read it but there will be a recording
[1:01:24] of This Bride on the the other side and
[1:01:27] there will be a hall of history of the
[1:01:30] great warriors of the faith and I want
[1:01:32] to see your name there in my name there
[1:01:35] that we survive Leo
[1:01:40] toia
[1:01:43] hallelujah amen so he goes on
[1:01:47] down just want to catch a few more of
[1:01:51] these so you find then that he brother
[1:01:55] Brenham and the exposition of the seven
[1:01:56] Church ages in the
[1:01:58] resume he makes this statement right
[1:02:02] now the church is plural
[1:02:07] amen that are
[1:02:09] controlling politics he's talking about
[1:02:12] churches churches
[1:02:15] plural that are controlling politics and
[1:02:18] he says that's happening right now amen
[1:02:21] now it's no secret I don't think anyone
[1:02:24] would would deny
[1:02:26] that it is churches who put Donald Trump
[1:02:30] in office yes that's right because that
[1:02:33] he had enough if he didn't have the
[1:02:35] Conservative Christian Movement
[1:02:38] so-called he would have never even
[1:02:39] probably won the Primary right because
[1:02:42] the man has made so many statements and
[1:02:44] actions that are so egregious to human
[1:02:46] intelligence and as I said to you last
[1:02:49] time I'm not Prejudice I hate both of
[1:02:52] them that's a joke of course I I I hope
[1:02:55] let the Lord to get a hold of their
[1:02:57] lives
[1:02:58] somehow and and but I know this that God
[1:03:00] is in control say who's going to win the
[1:03:03] election and we and we were all saying
[1:03:05] it come on we were we were saying
[1:03:06] whoever God has picked it's not going to
[1:03:09] be the world is going to have an
[1:03:10] election they're going to spend
[1:03:11] gazillions of dollars on it and people
[1:03:13] are going to get on and Talking Heads
[1:03:14] are going to argue and fight over it
[1:03:16] you're going to have a pre-election and
[1:03:17] election and a postelection and this
[1:03:19] thing's going to go on for years and
[1:03:21] they're already figuring out 2028 I'm
[1:03:23] here to tell you God already knows who
[1:03:25] the 10 a gold president would be who the
[1:03:27] one we're replacing the one we're
[1:03:28] getting the next one if there's a next
[1:03:30] one I'm just so glad we know who is in
[1:03:38] control so he
[1:03:40] says he calls them churches now of
[1:03:43] course these are the
[1:03:44] ones that he had he had that's in the
[1:03:47] resume because he had already the resume
[1:03:50] is a resume of all of them and backing
[1:03:52] up going to the th tyon age you remember
[1:03:54] we've read it before where brother
[1:03:56] Brenham deals with that in the Book of
[1:03:58] Revelation chapter 3 and he speaks to
[1:04:00] the churches and we've read this before
[1:04:02] brother Brenham says in the th tyan
[1:04:04] Church age now why does he call these
[1:04:06] churches his churches even though they
[1:04:09] are the false Vine the truth of the
[1:04:12] matter is that they are Christians but
[1:04:15] they are not Christians of the
[1:04:18] spirit they are Christians of the flesh
[1:04:22] they are bearing the
[1:04:24] name so brother br said they're they
[1:04:27] they and he goes on and I've read it
[1:04:29] before they they appreciate the the fine
[1:04:31] qualities of Jesus
[1:04:34] see yeah I don't have that one but it's
[1:04:36] okay and and so so they subscribe to the
[1:04:40] fact that Jesus is the son of God born
[1:04:42] of a virgin can't died to save Sinners
[1:04:44] died to save the world every bit of
[1:04:46] that's true every bit of that's true but
[1:04:49] that's just the letter of
[1:04:50] truth that's that's not the spirit that
[1:04:53] therefore he says they're not Christians
[1:04:56] of the spirit they are Christians of the
[1:04:58] flesh because they can read about it and
[1:05:01] in this book and in other books and
[1:05:03] discover the history of what Jesus of
[1:05:05] Nazareth did and subscribed to the Fine
[1:05:08] qualities of his life and they've built
[1:05:10] churches and by this time now we've got
[1:05:12] north of
[1:05:13] 33,000 north of that 33,000 differ
[1:05:18] interpretations of the Gospel amen amen
[1:05:22] so take your pick you know pick one get
[1:05:24] in line somewhere I'm glad that I've got
[1:05:27] the original
[1:05:28] one Hallelujah and so so we find then he
[1:05:32] says they do bear the name but Jesus
[1:05:35] warned the Earth in the seventh chapter
[1:05:39] of the Gospel of Mark in the seventh
[1:05:42] verse how be it in
[1:05:44] vain see they do bear the name but how
[1:05:48] be it in vain do they worship me
[1:05:51] teaching for doctrines the Commandments
[1:05:53] of men he doesn't say
[1:05:56] in vain do they they worship me because
[1:05:58] they're bad people he says they they're
[1:06:01] they worship me in vain because they're
[1:06:04] not following the word of the hour and
[1:06:07] what they're doing is is they follow the
[1:06:09] Commandments of men and there's nothing
[1:06:11] in here that's a commandment of a man
[1:06:15] this is the this is a book written by
[1:06:17] God himself see and so as soon as you
[1:06:20] start getting an ad mixture of man-made
[1:06:23] Theory then you it's all it's all it
[1:06:26] becomes mongrelized at that point and
[1:06:28] I'm here to tell you that was never
[1:06:30] going to bring the ministry of the son
[1:06:32] of man back to the people it's going to
[1:06:34] have to take a complete restoration of
[1:06:36] the word and not just the word but the
[1:06:38] life inside the word the spirit would
[1:06:40] have to
[1:06:42] Fallen amen so he says you know we are
[1:06:47] living in the end time it's a
[1:06:51] statement you know we are living in the
[1:06:53] end time
[1:06:55] it is in this age that the churches are
[1:06:58] going to come
[1:06:59] together and as they are even now
[1:07:01] controlling World politics it's still
[1:07:03] churches see amen they are controlling
[1:07:07] World politics they will soon control
[1:07:09] the finances of the world then if you
[1:07:12] don't belong to the world organization
[1:07:14] of churches you won't be able to buy nor
[1:07:17] sell now at that point we're gone yes
[1:07:21] amen so then we're somewhere between
[1:07:25] that that and they are even now
[1:07:27] controlling World politics they will
[1:07:29] soon control the
[1:07:31] finances so we're somewhere between
[1:07:34] they're in control of world politics but
[1:07:37] they can't enforce except you by
[1:07:39] yourself because the bride is still here
[1:07:41] so we're we're just right in the in
[1:07:43] right in there where that comma
[1:07:46] is you understand friends that's what
[1:07:48] it's come down to we've come down and
[1:07:51] everything has come to an end and the
[1:07:53] next event can't come until we're gone
[1:07:56] Hallelujah and then when we're gone
[1:07:59] you're going to then he says he says now
[1:08:02] those those of the of the unwise Virgin
[1:08:05] is who he's speaking of he says you will
[1:08:06] lose
[1:08:07] all those who stay true to God so
[1:08:11] because there will be yes amen now if
[1:08:14] there's if there's people in the
[1:08:18] tribulation who stay true to God then it
[1:08:22] often obviously meant they were already
[1:08:24] true to God as far as as they knew that
[1:08:27] they were true righteous people who were
[1:08:30] living as best they understood now
[1:08:33] they're obviously not the bride because
[1:08:34] they're in the
[1:08:36] tribulation so you understand the world
[1:08:39] is filled with good people who are who
[1:08:41] are not they're not about what I'm about
[1:08:44] to read listen to this description those
[1:08:47] who stay true to God and keep their
[1:08:49] garments clean from the defilement of
[1:08:52] this world system of church ERS will be
[1:08:57] physically bereft those are the ones
[1:08:59] that'll get hunted down like dogs and
[1:09:01] killed now I always wondered how is that
[1:09:04] going to work um because how would the
[1:09:08] Constitution of the United States allow
[1:09:10] people to be killed for their religious
[1:09:14] belief and I I knew it was in the word I
[1:09:16] could see it in the Book of Revelation I
[1:09:18] just thought man there must just be such
[1:09:20] a throwing down of the Constitution and
[1:09:23] brother Brandon was saying already in
[1:09:25] the we don't even have a constitution
[1:09:27] anymore they they've just they've
[1:09:29] they've been breaking it and all it does
[1:09:30] is get worse and worse every year so now
[1:09:33] you when you think about it in those
[1:09:35] terms you
[1:09:36] realize that that that when you and and
[1:09:41] here here's something I just saw
[1:09:42] recently you know that Donald Trump took
[1:09:46] in Robert Kennedy took in RFK yeah right
[1:09:51] and so he he took in uh Bobby Kennedy I
[1:09:55] guess would be his son or maybe it's
[1:09:58] nephew thank you yeah and so one of the
[1:10:02] things that he and I heard it with my
[1:10:04] own ears he was at at one of the
[1:10:07] political speeches and he was saying
[1:10:11] that the that the current Administration
[1:10:13] he was just blasting his own
[1:10:16] Democratic um um people and so he was
[1:10:20] saying and he called them by name Biden
[1:10:23] and Kamala have have found he said they
[1:10:26] have just pushed through a law for the
[1:10:31] very first time in American
[1:10:36] history and I thought wow this is RFK
[1:10:39] I'm gonna pay attention to what he's
[1:10:40] about to say and they've got it now and
[1:10:43] it's already on the books and ready to
[1:10:45] be enforced and the law simply states
[1:10:48] that in times of national crisis anyone
[1:10:52] who publicly speaks against the
[1:10:56] government it can be put in prison yeah
[1:11:00] and completely confined to prison I'm
[1:11:03] here to tell you something friends it
[1:11:04] won't take much more after that to just
[1:11:07] put them to death and brother bradam
[1:11:08] said they will be hunted down like dogs
[1:11:11] oh hide me in the cleff of the rock oh
[1:11:14] I'm so glad for a message that's going
[1:11:16] to take me out of here before that day
[1:11:19] amen so he says they will be physically
[1:11:21] bere now watch this now he's going to
[1:11:24] talk about those who are Miss the
[1:11:26] Rapture but who are not living they're
[1:11:30] that they're just Christians of the
[1:11:31] flesh watch this there will be a great
[1:11:34] there will be presented to them a great
[1:11:36] temptation to give in Preachers will
[1:11:38] give in with the excuse that they will
[1:11:41] serve God within the framework of the
[1:11:43] Antichrist Beast system because the
[1:11:45] option is close your doors and don't be
[1:11:47] a church
[1:11:48] anymore so they will reason that well
[1:11:50] I'll operate within the framework of the
[1:11:52] Antichrist Beast system they will will
[1:11:55] give in to the flatteries and
[1:11:57] blandishments of the hierarchy and the
[1:11:59] people will follow these false Shepherds
[1:12:04] right into the slaughter but in the
[1:12:07] Judgment they will be found naked they
[1:12:11] will not be given those white robes amen
[1:12:15] the foolish virgin will get white robes
[1:12:19] and that's not you they wash their robes
[1:12:21] in the blood of the Lamb that's not the
[1:12:23] bride it's the foolish virgin who wash
[1:12:25] their robes in the blood of the Lamb
[1:12:27] because as far as the bride brother
[1:12:29] brandham said you are the blood of God
[1:12:31] by the spirit we don't have to wash our
[1:12:34] robes I've already passed from Death to
[1:12:36] life I already have the righteousness of
[1:12:39] Christ upon my
[1:12:41] life but those unwise virgin will stay
[1:12:44] true and they are holy people they're
[1:12:46] Holiness people they're righteous people
[1:12:49] as best they understand as best they
[1:12:52] understand the word of God they're
[1:12:54] sincere are Sav from destruction amen
[1:12:57] and they'll be granted eternal life
[1:12:59] they'll be given white robes they'll
[1:13:01] wash their robes in the blood of the
[1:13:02] lamb but brother brandham is saying that
[1:13:04] the rest which is the majority in the
[1:13:07] Judgment they will be found naked they
[1:13:08] will not be given those white robes
[1:13:10] neither will they walk with him you
[1:13:12] can't walk in spotted garments of the
[1:13:14] world holding hands with the devil here
[1:13:17] and then expect to be with God can I say
[1:13:20] that again you can't be found in the
[1:13:23] world holding hands with the devil here
[1:13:26] and expect to be with God you cannot
[1:13:28] live here and hold hands with the devil
[1:13:31] and expect to live with God you
[1:13:34] understand friends you cannot live here
[1:13:36] and hold hands with the devil and expect
[1:13:38] to live with God that's never going to
[1:13:45] happen so so now so then and of course
[1:13:49] this makes sense to me this whole thing
[1:13:50] I thought about it and why I got to
[1:13:52] close this whole thing makes sense to to
[1:13:55] me because when brother brandham is
[1:13:59] talking about his day and even to this
[1:14:00] day right at this moment the
[1:14:05] churches are in control of politics yes
[1:14:09] so this makes sense because it's not yet
[1:14:12] Rome it's Rome through her daughters yes
[1:14:16] amen see amen because Rome is the Beast
[1:14:20] system that takes it all and sets up an
[1:14:23] image to the Beast and the pope is in
[1:14:24] the driver
[1:14:26] and that's where the the Book of
[1:14:27] Revelation shows that when Satan is cast
[1:14:30] out of Heaven the bride goes up Satan is
[1:14:32] cast down he incarnates the false
[1:14:35] prophet which is the which will be the
[1:14:38] pope of Rome and then he become brother
[1:14:41] Bram said he becomes an incarnate devil
[1:14:45] where he's now the false prophet he's an
[1:14:47] incarnate devil but prior to that uh
[1:14:50] there's a there's a there's an image
[1:14:52] erected to the Beast which is all of the
[1:14:55] daughters building an image to the Beast
[1:14:58] amen oh my goodness friend you are to be
[1:15:01] rejoicing to say I'm so glad I can see
[1:15:03] all of this and I know how to avoid it
[1:15:05] and this is not part of my future and
[1:15:08] and why is this so relevant because the
[1:15:10] whole world is running now thinking
[1:15:12] they've got the Savior thinking it's all
[1:15:13] going to be good thinking it's all going
[1:15:15] to be fixed now we've got peace and
[1:15:18] safety right brother you know
[1:15:21] something here's here's brother Jason
[1:15:23] thinking out loud to you
[1:15:25] you good with
[1:15:26] that here is 40 years probably 45 years
[1:15:31] of studying the word of God intently and
[1:15:34] studying The Book of Revelation verse by
[1:15:36] verse about three and a half four years
[1:15:38] ago I started on online on a on a on a
[1:15:42] coast to coast it actually goes around
[1:15:44] the world a a group of teachers and I
[1:15:46] gathered and we started breaking down we
[1:15:49] started doing in a deep dive on the
[1:15:51] entire Book of Revelation verse by verse
[1:15:54] amen
[1:15:55] and and I get questions all the time I
[1:15:58] get I get calls all the time ministers
[1:16:00] calling me what how do you see this
[1:16:01] because they know that I've studied it
[1:16:03] so closely for the last several years
[1:16:06] and when I when I begin to look at how
[1:16:08] the whole thing is beginning to shape up
[1:16:11] it is not lost on me amen that sometimes
[1:16:14] we we say well there's going to have to
[1:16:18] be a big Financial collapse and then
[1:16:22] Rome that's how Rome is going to take
[1:16:24] over
[1:16:25] okay can I just point out something to
[1:16:28] you that I think
[1:16:29] about when I read the
[1:16:32] last remnants of a description of
[1:16:36] leoa she's not she's actually believes
[1:16:39] she's still rich and increased with
[1:16:43] goods and has need of nothing see so
[1:16:47] however that flips and switches and we
[1:16:52] say we yeah but but the the Rome's going
[1:16:54] to use the gold and buy it all out
[1:16:56] because they're going to make a deal
[1:16:58] with Wall Street and that's the Jews and
[1:17:00] then they're going to break the Covenant
[1:17:02] just okay great I because that's the way
[1:17:04] I see it too that's the way brother
[1:17:05] brandham saw it but even but even
[1:17:07] remember even brother brandham as a
[1:17:09] prophet when he's asked in C about that
[1:17:12] brother Brandon where in the scripture
[1:17:14] does it talk about Rome is going to make
[1:17:15] a deal with the Jews in Wall Street and
[1:17:17] then they're going to break it and
[1:17:19] brother brandham says well he said it's
[1:17:20] not in the scripture he said but but
[1:17:23] what is in the scripture causes me to
[1:17:26] conclude that that's the only thing that
[1:17:27] could happen because we do know that
[1:17:30] what the scripture does teach is that
[1:17:32] she'll rule through through uh craft and
[1:17:36] through flatteries see and so and we do
[1:17:39] see the terrible things that are coming
[1:17:41] upon the world in the tribulation
[1:17:43] they're going to I'm here to tell you
[1:17:45] don't imagine that this world is going
[1:17:46] to survive in the current sit in the
[1:17:48] current way you see it something is
[1:17:50] gonna happen and and and all I know is
[1:17:53] is right now the churches are
[1:17:55] controlling politics and they're working
[1:17:57] right in the hands of God to put whoever
[1:18:00] they need in office and and I'm here to
[1:18:02] tell you don't the whole reason I'm
[1:18:05] saying this is so you don't sit back and
[1:18:07] say I'm just going to wait till it looks
[1:18:09] like a collapse you're going to be found
[1:18:12] oh my you're going to be found missing
[1:18:13] out because this age is Rich and
[1:18:16] increased with Goods at least it thinks
[1:18:18] it is and I'm here to tell you that I'm
[1:18:20] not going to be a part of this system I
[1:18:23] don't care about the the World Order of
[1:18:25] the system I'm looking to make my home
[1:18:28] in a new world I'm looking to have
[1:18:31] Christ come among
[1:18:34] us see and so this is why this is
[1:18:38] exactly why and brother Brandon when he
[1:18:41] goes
[1:18:42] to to comes to the end of the world
[1:18:45] falling
[1:18:46] apart and and we come down to to this he
[1:18:50] comes down to this and I'm going to come
[1:18:52] to this part and I'm going to close for
[1:18:54] tonight
[1:19:00] he's dealt
[1:19:02] with
[1:19:03] Alexander and
[1:19:06] Jesus he's dealt with in this sermon
[1:19:10] World
[1:19:11] politics he's dealt with church politics
[1:19:16] amen and and now he's going to come down
[1:19:19] to speak to the true church because
[1:19:23] that's why he's there a prophet is not
[1:19:26] using his valuable limited time to try
[1:19:30] to persuade the world they're never
[1:19:32] going to be persuaded he's trying to
[1:19:34] bring the word to the elect lady now he
[1:19:39] doesn't exactly know who all she is he
[1:19:40] admits that in in in Chicago in 63 and
[1:19:44] he says Lord according to that Vision
[1:19:46] the other day talking about seeing that
[1:19:47] those little girls in the preview of the
[1:19:49] bread he said according to that Vision
[1:19:50] the other day he said I I I I I I know
[1:19:53] she's out here here he said now I don't
[1:19:55] know who she is but we're just sewing
[1:19:58] seed oh Hallelujah I'm so glad that I
[1:20:02] got a hold of some of that seed I'm so
[1:20:04] glad that it spoke to me from an inside
[1:20:07] way that's something I can't even put in
[1:20:09] words but something in here matched
[1:20:11] something in here and I said I that's
[1:20:14] what I want to
[1:20:15] be
[1:20:17] Hallelujah and so now he's going to he's
[1:20:20] going to come and try to bring some help
[1:20:22] for you and I because now he's just he's
[1:20:25] left it standing to say we're at the end
[1:20:27] politics at the end uh Church politics
[1:20:30] National politics and now we're we're
[1:20:32] realizing science is even has even
[1:20:34] limited themselves because now they've
[1:20:36] chased after Beauty yeah we find out
[1:20:39] that they're trying to create to to try
[1:20:41] to think you know is there a possibility
[1:20:44] of creating humans W without even using
[1:20:47] uh the normal me method I'm here to tell
[1:20:48] you friends it's Satan's
[1:20:50] Eden and and it's come back full circle
[1:20:53] again and you are alive and remain and
[1:20:55] it's those who are alive and I'm here to
[1:20:57] tell you I'm not just alive but I remain
[1:21:00] a Believer I remain committed to
[1:21:05] God and so he comes now he's dealt with
[1:21:08] all of that and now he comes to
[1:21:10] this he goes back to the Corinthian
[1:21:14] Church because they've got a problem
[1:21:16] they always had a problem Corinth had a
[1:21:18] terrible problem and their problem in a
[1:21:22] nutshell was balance
[1:21:25] amen they just couldn't stay balanced
[1:21:27] Paul was constantly having to correct
[1:21:30] their
[1:21:31] balance and they they were a true church
[1:21:34] they were the elect lady but they're you
[1:21:37] know they're chasing after this one and
[1:21:38] chasing after that one and this gift and
[1:21:41] that power and this tongue and this
[1:21:42] thing and and Paul's constantly having
[1:21:44] to put out Little Brush fires and try to
[1:21:46] call them around and and then and then
[1:21:48] they're they're even they're even found
[1:21:50] giving in to to powerless teaching yeah
[1:21:55] you know like brother Joe was talking
[1:21:57] about you know the the such a
[1:22:00] misunderstanding just like I was showing
[1:22:02] you the other night about brother I'm
[1:22:03] said you don't need a prayer line with
[1:22:04] perfect Faith you w need a prayer line
[1:22:06] and I showed what a silly argument that
[1:22:08] is to use that to say we shouldn't have
[1:22:10] a prayer line what a ridiculous thing to
[1:22:12] say and this bride isn't isn't babies
[1:22:15] anymore she's a mature lady she's ready
[1:22:17] for her body
[1:22:18] change and so we're not arguing over
[1:22:20] those kinds of things it when I I I
[1:22:23] spent plenty of time explaining exping
[1:22:24] why we do it and and now that I've seen
[1:22:27] how God works in it we saw it at the
[1:22:29] camp we saw it here Sunday don't come to
[1:22:31] me saying that there's no power in those
[1:22:33] things because we saw God Shake young
[1:22:36] people to the core we saw God move
[1:22:38] adults to the core and we're seeing the
[1:22:41] power of God
[1:22:43] moving and then the the the word and the
[1:22:46] word only and that one gets me the most
[1:22:48] I can't believe the imbalance that some
[1:22:50] people try to suggest that brother
[1:22:52] Brandon was meaning that's almost as
[1:22:54] ridiculous as brother brandham saying we
[1:22:56] can't mix Pentecost with the message and
[1:22:58] thinking that means the upper room
[1:23:00] experience how
[1:23:01] ridiculous that's completely ridiculous
[1:23:04] brother Brandon spends his whole time in
[1:23:05] this sermon arguing for that experience
[1:23:08] and he says that's what we need more and
[1:23:10] more in the
[1:23:11] church and he says they say well we've
[1:23:13] got the word and the word only all that
[1:23:15] means friends is that we no longer have
[1:23:17] an ad mixture we no longer have a
[1:23:20] mongrelized word we've got thus sayith
[1:23:22] the Lord we've got the word and the word
[1:23:24] only the word alone no man-made Theory
[1:23:27] it's the pure unadulterated word of God
[1:23:30] but the problem brother Bram is trying
[1:23:32] to help the church with he says he goes
[1:23:34] back to Corinthian and Paul to the
[1:23:36] Corinthian Church and he says Paul said
[1:23:39] I never come to you with the Excellency
[1:23:42] of
[1:23:43] words and wisdom of this world because
[1:23:45] you'll build your faith on that see and
[1:23:49] so during the time of Christ's first
[1:23:51] coming one of the leading problem
[1:23:54] problems we find in the in the in the
[1:23:57] early church that Paul was dealing with
[1:23:59] especially at Corinthia one of the early
[1:24:02] problems was a desire for Excellency of
[1:24:06] words see uh it was it was the
[1:24:09] Corinthians who as I said they used up
[1:24:11] so much of Paul's precious time always
[1:24:14] with problems and spiritual balance and
[1:24:17] he told the Corinthian Church I never
[1:24:20] come to you with the Excellency of words
[1:24:22] and wisdom of this world and so we
[1:24:25] realize that what he's trying to get
[1:24:26] them to understand is that the answer is
[1:24:29] not in word only I never came to you
[1:24:32] with Excellency of speech but I came to
[1:24:35] you in power and demonstration of the
[1:24:39] dynamic Spirit of the Living God listen
[1:24:42] friends that's what the Jubilee was all
[1:24:44] about you understand why they had to
[1:24:46] wait till the 50th day because the
[1:24:49] Jubilee was what had been promised all
[1:24:52] through the Old Testament God had been
[1:24:55] promising them through Millennia someday
[1:24:59] I'm going to live down inside of you I'm
[1:25:01] not just going to be above you I'm not
[1:25:03] just going to be with you but I'm not
[1:25:05] and I'm not just going to be word only
[1:25:07] I'm going to be the Living Word with
[1:25:09] Dynamic power that's going to come down
[1:25:12] into the church and the ministry of the
[1:25:14] son of man will walk the earth and it
[1:25:16] won't just be a temporary thing
[1:25:18] happening through a prophet but it's
[1:25:20] going to be an entire people who now the
[1:25:23] Holy Spirit can flow through to a dying
[1:25:27] world that's where we are friends the
[1:25:30] dynamic power of the Holy Spirit do we
[1:25:34] have the word we sure do and we thank
[1:25:36] God for it but it's not just a dead
[1:25:39] letter it's a living
[1:25:41] experience it doesn't specify any
[1:25:44] certain emotion or any certain
[1:25:46] manifestation but what it does is it'll
[1:25:49] change your heart and it'll change your
[1:25:51] mind and it'll change your walk and your
[1:25:54] talk and your entire life will be
[1:25:58] changed and that's what we want and
[1:26:00] that's why we saw a camp and that's what
[1:26:02] we saw here son Hallelujah I'm a witness
[1:26:05] of these
[1:26:08] things do you want that Bal
[1:26:11] Tabernacle is that the direction we're
[1:26:13] going in we're not going after dead
[1:26:15] letter we're not going after word with
[1:26:17] no Spirit the word and the word only is
[1:26:20] the very life of almighty God
[1:26:25] yeah if it wasn't the word and the word
[1:26:27] only you couldn't get the
[1:26:31] token amen you understand because the
[1:26:35] display here's another here's another
[1:26:38] teaching from The Book of Revelation the
[1:26:41] display of the Holy Ghost has always
[1:26:45] been parallel to the word that was
[1:26:50] revealed that's why it didn't make
[1:26:52] Luther stop drinking beer right amen but
[1:26:56] yet brother brandham said don't say he
[1:26:58] wasn't born again he certainly was don't
[1:27:00] say he didn't have the Holy Ghost he
[1:27:02] certainly did but the but the
[1:27:04] possibility of the level of experience
[1:27:07] they were that they could get access to
[1:27:09] the Token had not been seen since the
[1:27:12] days of the Jubilee in the early church
[1:27:15] when they had an abstract title and they
[1:27:17] were on their way to a Rapture now it
[1:27:19] had to be the seed had to go into the
[1:27:21] ground we know that a prophet showed us
[1:27:23] that the seed had to go into the ground
[1:27:26] but here here at the end time friends
[1:27:28] we've come Beyond Luther we've come
[1:27:29] Beyond Wesley we've come Beyond isua
[1:27:32] we've come back to the full word and the
[1:27:35] full token can now be on display and
[1:27:37] that brother brandom said is what will
[1:27:39] bring the dead for hundreds of years out
[1:27:43] of the
[1:27:44] Grave oh that's what I want to see
[1:27:46] friends I don't care about who's a
[1:27:49] president who's elected it's all going
[1:27:52] to the Beast system I just want know
[1:27:54] that that that Jesus is my
[1:27:59] king rise up to your feet friends that's
[1:28:01] what you want to pursue that's what you
[1:28:04] want to chase young person young man
[1:28:07] young woman you want to make something
[1:28:08] out of your life pursue the king
[1:28:11] hallelujah we're not here to be
[1:28:13] political activists oh this world is not
[1:28:17] my home I'm just passing through my
[1:28:20] treasures are laid up somewhere beyond
[1:28:23] the blue the Angels beckon me where from
[1:28:27] Heaven's open
[1:28:28] door because of that I can't feel at
[1:28:31] home in this world anymore
[1:28:35] am oh I love that song and we're going
[1:28:37] to have to come back to our Jubilee
[1:28:39] again that brother Tony had us jumping
[1:28:41] with praise the Lord friends list
[1:28:44] listen I the the one thing that that I
[1:28:47] so strive for and is it's Paramount to
[1:28:52] me is that we have
[1:28:54] bance in the word of God
[1:28:57] Amen an imbalance is one of the most
[1:29:01] detrimental aspects aever a real one a
[1:29:05] bonafied one born again of the spirit of
[1:29:07] God but with an imbalanced understanding
[1:29:10] and I just say Lord God let me be clear
[1:29:12] let me be understood and let me come
[1:29:15] with the word with a balanced approach
[1:29:17] believing everything a prophet said
[1:29:19] about it is that you bethl Tabernacle is
[1:29:22] that what your vision of a true church
[1:29:24] church is I'm here to tell you God
[1:29:26] confirms it God was confirming it at

[1:30:03] perfect Faith that's what's going to
[1:30:05] give you overcoming power and I'm here
[1:30:07] to tell you it will defeat the Devil I
[1:30:09] don't know you know when I when I look
[1:30:11] at that and I just say you know he he
[1:30:14] came in such a way that he even he even
[1:30:18] left room there in the scripture he left
[1:30:21] room for our human weaknesses
[1:30:25] amen you believe that oh yeah because it
[1:30:27] it it deals with us in general but it's
[1:30:30] not an absolute word I I I I don't want
[1:30:32] to open up my my iPad and go back to it
[1:30:35] again but God is here to bring you to
[1:30:39] every position that he saw of you before
[1:30:42] the foundation of the world and that
[1:30:43] should be your prayer say Lord bring me
[1:30:46] today this day bring me a little closer
[1:30:49] to the
[1:30:51] image you saw of me
[1:30:54] can you can you have that kind of faith
[1:30:58] can you believe he saw you before the
[1:31:01] foundation of the world if you can
[1:31:03] believe that because remember in perfect
[1:31:05] faith brother B said that's one of the
[1:31:07] there's several there's three or four
[1:31:08] five main points in one of them is you
[1:31:10] got to believe who you are you got to
[1:31:12] believe what he has said about you that
[1:31:15] you're the Spotless unadulterated Virgin
[1:31:17] Queen you're a bride of all of Christ he
[1:31:20] wouldn't have chosen you had you not
[1:31:22] been I don't know what kind of past
[1:31:24] you've had I don't know what kind of
[1:31:26] trouble you might be in but I'm here to
[1:31:28] tell you the word can call you up out of
[1:31:30] it into a higher place not just a word
[1:31:33] not just a teaching not just a Doctrine
[1:31:36] but teaching that comes with the power
[1:31:38] of the word of God am it's why I'm so
[1:31:41] glad for the ministry we got here we got
[1:31:42] a team of preachers who who teach and
[1:31:45] preach the word of God with power and
[1:31:47] demonstration of the Holy Spirit and we
[1:31:50] see it move and I'm say Lord God pour it
[1:31:53] on Hallelujah you won't that say Lord
[1:31:55] pour it on let our church go grow even
[1:31:58] higher in the spirit of God we're not
[1:32:01] trying to write a prescription on on
[1:32:04] whatever kind of sensation emotion or
[1:32:06] demonstration whatever just let God do
[1:32:09] it people people get sometimes worried I
[1:32:11] was discussing this with a brother just
[1:32:13] the other day very very sincere asking a
[1:32:16] question you know what about the gifts
[1:32:18] and I said brother brandham said write
[1:32:19] in that sermon WR in you I mean he's
[1:32:23] preaching the world is falling apart
[1:32:26] amen and in that message of all
[1:32:29] messages he's going to say the gifts
[1:32:33] operate in the church to keep the church
[1:32:35] clean yeah see that's why they operate
[1:32:38] to keep the church clean why would I be
[1:32:40] worried about gifts when we're a mature
[1:32:43] bride I understand the bride went
[1:32:45] through a babyhood she was an infant she
[1:32:47] had to grow up we we we we got it wrong
[1:32:50] many times and brother Bram talks about
[1:32:52] the Lord said you can't teach these
[1:32:53] things to Pentecostal babies well we're
[1:32:56] not Pentecostal babies anymore we were
[1:32:58] infants of the word but the bride has
[1:33:00] risen now to to a mature woman I just
[1:33:03] say Lord whatever you need to do what
[1:33:05] however you need to work let it work
[1:33:08] we're not here to put him in a box and
[1:33:10] limit anything that God can do why would
[1:33:13] I worry about it we're not immature
[1:33:15] anymore we know how we know how to how
[1:33:17] to we know the will of God brother

[1:44:48] amen I got one I'm going to give brother
[1:44:49] Chris all
[1:44:51] right our dog we uh we have a boxer
[1:44:54] that's uh almost three and he uh he had
[1:44:56] a series of episodes throughout the last
[1:44:58] three years where he collapsed and is
[1:45:00] like a seizure or something we don't
[1:45:02] know but we took him to a specialist and
[1:45:05] he saw a heart doctor and the
[1:45:06] cardiologist said that you know he had a
[1:45:09] potentially a condition that boxers can
[1:45:11] get that they typically grow out of but
[1:45:14] they don't always and sometimes they
[1:45:16] require medicine so long story short we
[1:45:18] uh had a prayer cloth prayed over and
[1:45:20] put it on his collar a couple weeks ago
[1:45:22] and took yesterday to the cardiologist
[1:45:24] and just want to give God thanks she she
[1:45:26] said his heart's absolutely perfect God
[1:45:28] and so no condition whatsoever she said
[1:45:30] in fact his blood pumps like really good
[1:45:32] he's amazing and so I just thankful for
[1:45:35] that amen praise the
[1:45:39] Lord who you pointing that brother oh
[1:45:42] Chris there you
[1:45:44] go okay I wasn't going to give this but
[1:45:47] the sister that just spoke about the
[1:45:48] hurricane made me have to say it so um
[1:45:51] probably like a month ago a few days
[1:45:53] after Hurricane Helen um for anybody who
[1:45:56] doesn't know I'm a plumber and so me and
[1:45:58] my coworker went to a job where there
[1:46:00] was a tankless water heater that got hit
[1:46:02] by a tree and knocked it off of the the
[1:46:04] the house wall um everything was still
[1:46:07] hooked up so we were told to rehook it
[1:46:09] up or remount it to the wall anyway it
[1:46:12] all happened really fast but my
[1:46:14] cooworker wanted to see if it's still
[1:46:17] functioned because everything was hooked
[1:46:19] up and
[1:46:20] um if for anybody who doesn't know
[1:46:23] tangless water here is on demand so once
[1:46:25] you run water it automatically ignites
[1:46:28] so he hit the relief line to make water
[1:46:30] come through the heater and apparently I
[1:46:32] guess there was an internal leak well
[1:46:34] the water heater exploded in our faces
[1:46:36] oh my and it was about as loud as a
[1:46:38] cannon so it was louder than a gunshot a
[1:46:41] neighbor came and checked on us but my
[1:46:43] coworker's hand was literally on the
[1:46:45] heater as it exploded and I was standing
[1:46:47] right beside him and we left unscathed
[1:46:49] untouched praise the Lord thank the Lord
[1:46:51] for that
[1:46:55] amen praise the lord lord watches out
[1:46:58] for his people amen and he work he he he
[1:47:01] he favors your co-workers if you happen
[1:47:03] to be standing near
[1:47:04] them amen praise the Lord anybody else
[1:47:08] before we go
[1:47:09] tonight all right so coming into church
[1:47:12] so sister Debbie and I were driving and
[1:47:15] you know we were we always say oh my
[1:47:17] goodness once the clocks go back then we
[1:47:19] got to drive to church in the dark and
[1:47:21] it's just a whole different thing and
[1:47:22] then it was rain training and so we're
[1:47:24] driving and so we were excited to be at
[1:47:26] church to get here sing songs clap our
[1:47:28] hands and enjoy the presence of God so
[1:47:31] we're pulling leaving s Point Road go
[1:47:34] across the intersection and I'm headed
[1:47:37] up with you know Publix on this side and
[1:47:39] and U Wells Fargo on this side and right
[1:47:41] as I'm picking up speed I'm probably at
[1:47:43] 40 45 miles an hour and a car comes like
[1:47:47] leaving Publix or the the road up above
[1:47:49] it and he comes in and he's going to do
[1:47:51] that thing where he gets in in the
[1:47:53] middle and then waits for traffic to
[1:47:54] clear except he didn't wait in the
[1:47:56] middle and he decided to not wait in the
[1:47:58] middle when I'm 3 feet coming by him
[1:48:01] he's doing 10 miles hour and I'm doing
[1:48:03] 45 and there's an F-150 right on my I
[1:48:06] got a wingman right here and and it all

[1:48:24] contact for sure and I didn't contact on
