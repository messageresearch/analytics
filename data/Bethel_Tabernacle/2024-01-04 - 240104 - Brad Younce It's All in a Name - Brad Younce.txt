knows your name a lot of people don't know me I'm thank God tonight that he knows who I am how many's thankful how many than thanks that God knows who you are I don't care if Donald Trump don't know who I am as long as Jesus Christ knows me that's all that matters is this yours if you have your Bibles let's turn to Proverbs Chapter 18:1 I sent the booth about three scriptures I'm just going to read one scripture each so if you don't get to it I'll just I'll just read it so Proverbs 18 in verse 10 the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous runthe and is safe so the name of the Lord is a place of safety and refuge so Acts chapter 4:12 this is Peter talking of Jesus he said neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under Heaven given among men whereby you must be saved Amen in Philippians 2:9 says wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name may God add a blessings you can have your seats for a title this evening a little simple little thought it's all in a name it's all in a name you know a name carries an identity it's an authority or a legacy so throughout the scriptures names are significant because they reveal character and purpose you know brother brand off to emphasize the power of the name of Jesus noting is authority over sickness sin and Satan it's all in a name I thought this was pretty interesting I looked up what's What's the phrase actually mean it's all in a name you heard the saying it's all in a name it's all in name means the essence or key understanding of something in is directly implied by its name suggesting that the name itself fully explains the nature or purpose of something without needing further explanation essentially the name tells you everything that you need to know so when you hear somebody's name you just know when you hear a name of something you just know it's like a race car when you hear somebody say race car your mind don't go to a little Pinto your mind don't go to a little Volkswagen but your mind goes to something that was built for racing something that's built to run fast amen the company there's a company called Healthy Choice when you think of Healthy Choice you don't think of Big Macs Double Quarter Pounders so healthy choice makes you think of healthy foods I'm going somewhere hang on when someone says Lowe's or Walmart it's all in the name you know what they're saying if somebody says Lowe's we're going to go to Lowe's and buy some stuff for the house when you go to Walmart you're going shopping it's all in the name we know what's going on when someone says do side we know it's Seafood it's all in the name amen you're like what in the world that don't need an explanation when I say Walmart you don't need explain to you what Walmart is you automatically know when there's knocking at your door and somebody says open up it's the law you don't go by and say what who's the law you know you better open up there's something about a name you are identified by your name your name tells who you are when someone says Donald Trump we know who he is we know he's the next president of the United States we don't need somebody to really explain who Donald Trump is everybody knows who he is it's like when somebody says LeBron James we know who he is Elon Musk We Know by his name who he is so if you're out somebody says do you know brother Jason Watkins like yeah we know who he is we know who he when you hear his name you know he's the Pastor bethl Tabernacle we don't need no introduction when somebody says Donnie Reagan we know who he is hello you don't have to explain it these people are welln well-known people we don't have to explain who they are there's a lot of people that don't know my name the mayor of Buford don't know who I am the governor of South Carolina don't care who I am and surely Briden don't know who I am but it don't matter my name will never be on a billboard my name is not on the who's who list down here but I thank God my name's on who's who in heaven you keep on naming all those great people you know if they happen to hear my name Brad y they'll say who who's Brad y who is that my name don't mean nothing to them but if you just say my name to Sarah she knows who I am I'm her husband when I hear her name I know who she is I don't need to ask who is Sarah Lord if I do y'all watch out you know when my mom and dads hear my name they don't need to ask who I am they know who I am I'm their son when God hears my name he don't have to look hey Gabriel who's Brad y God knows who I am when he hears my name he knows who I am when God hears your name brother Chris he knows exactly who you are you're the apple of his eye what's the apple of the eye the apple of one's eye refers to someone who is deeply cherished or valued by another so when I say I'm the apple of God's eye I am cherished by God so when God gives a name to something he has something special for that person when God speaks your name he has something special planned for you you know like in the Book of Genesis when it said in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth he spoke the Earth's name because he had something special made for the Earth you know he didn't say in the beginning God created the heavens and Jupiter or Pluto or Saturn their nam's not even mentioned in this Bible in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth he's got something special for this place we know what it is God will even change your name there's several in the Bible had a name change says if there's something there isn't if there isn't something in a name then why as long as Jacob was called Jacob which means Sur planter deceiver that's who he was God couldn't use Jacob while he was a deceiver but God had to come down and he had to get wrestling with him and change his name so we used to think we hear the name Jacob we think he ain't nothing but deceiver but we we now we hear his name Israel we hear Prince of God Amen Hallelujah Abraham had had to get a name changeed where he was Abram he could not receive a promise until he had a name change until his name become Abraham then he can fulfill the promise you get where I'm going what about Paul when he was he was Saul going and killing the Christians and arresting them he had to have a name change for God to even do God say this is going to be the first my prophet of the age but I got to change his name it's all in a name he couldn't be Saul no more he had to be Paul it's like Simon Peter his name his name was changed from Simon to Peter which means little Stone their names was changed because what you are called is something about it there is something about what you are called someone says it's all in the name they're indicating that it's in itself is significant and gives you all the information you need to understand it so if I was to stand here tonight and say Jehovah Gyra what am I saying the Lord is my provider if you hear me say Jehovah Rafa you know he's my healer when you hear me say Jehovah Shalom you know the Lord is my peace when you hear me say Jehovah nii the Lord is my banner when you hear me say Jehovah T his canoe the Lord is my righteousness it's all in a name when you hear me say Jehovah Shai you know the Lord's with me Hallelujah I'm so thankful God knows who I am that's all that matters he knows who you are he knows every one of you sitting here tonight he knows all about you it's all in that name people always saying be careful big brother's watching you don't look too long at that iPad they'll know what you're wearing but I'm glad I had have a friend that Stith closer than a brother I have somebody watching over me all right sticketh means to adhere to to join every person that will go back and watch this service God knows who they are those that listens to criticize he knows who you are God Knows My Name there's a lot of people out there that doesn't know their name they think he does but God knows who we are he knows our name because we have taken on his he has given us his name so the only way to take his name is you got to be married to him you know sisters when you that man you married you might have been his girlfriend you got engaged but you still didn't have his name you could take his check and go down to the bank and cash it your name you you can sign your name all you want to there say but I'm engaged to him it don't do any good you can't have what that man's got until you forfeit your own name she had to get rid of howchin she had to Forfeit everything that name stood for and when she took on my name heaven forbid she took everything that my name stood for good or bad notice I said bad last when you come up here on your wedding day and he says give me a symbol of your token of your love I say here's a ring and you slipped that ring on her finger then that preacher said in as much as a husband and wife have consented together in holy my wedlock and have witnessed to sing before God in this company and have pledged their love one to another I know this is simple and have witnessed before God in his company have pled to love one to another and have declared the Same by joining hands and giv and receiving of rings I pronounce them man and wife hallelujah what God has put together no man put us under he says you may kiss your bride he says I now present to you Mr and Ms Jason Watkins then everything that he has belongs to her now it's all in his name she lost her identity your wife loses her identity when she picks up yours oh oh my goodness when you on your spiritual wedding day you might have gone to some Youth Camp got all worked up you come back the same or go on to special meetings and got all worked up come back your life still running the same it was before you went something happened you can't say God I want to get engaged right now Gideon gets on his knees and says Lord where Gage will you marry me God says it won't work work that way I got to call you we're going to get engaged eventually when he's ready to ask you some of you's been dating for years finally did get engaged looking around see who I was looking for you're not married right then when God calls you you come and get Justified and Sanctified you're just engaged you're engaged to God you're not married just yet but you come up God says you said I want the Holy Ghost and then God slips that ring of unmar favor upon your hand God and God performing a wedding vow do you take this man yes yes I do when Jesus is brought before you do you take this man to your lawfully weeded husband and the church says I do hallelujah it's come our turn bride to be do you take this man to love to cherish to obey and the church says I do then you take on the name of Jesus and then God says as much as Jesus and the bride consent together in holy wedlock and have witnessed the same before God in the company of witnesses and have pledged their love to one to another and have declared the Same by join the hands I pronounced them husband and wife together in my name Hallelujah so what God has put together let no devils take us under so God just turns around says I pronounce you husband and wife you may kiss your bride Hallelujah we all know what a wedding does if it's your first one is special if it's your 15th one it's still special where in the world that come from and God says I present to you mister and Ms Jesus Christ we turn around we get a nice little hand clap from the crowd praise the Lord yeah this guy's crazy so everything he has is now yours all because you took on the name of Jesus Christ everything that belonged to God now belongs to you because it's all in a name everything that is so Associated to his name is yours if he is associated his name it's yours if deliver is associated his name it's yours we go on and on we have god-given privileges they're your promises when you receive that new birth and God slips that ring on your finger and everything that you have need of is in you then amen hallelujah we're a special people he's called us brother liking a church to a bride taking on the name of her husband Jesus Christ this signifies Unity Authority and inheritance the bride operates under the authority of his name continuing his ministry on the Earth so when the bride takes his name she takes his authority she is one with him operating in his stead on the earth yes sir now we start preaching it's all in a name his name brings power power in his name power to overcome power to overcome every devil every sickness power to claim his promises it's because you are a child of God you have took his name God's promised it God ain't like us we'll promise all kinds of things we'll say we'll do all kinds of things it's like yesterday I told Brother Matt I'd be his house working today I wasn't there cuz I had to be up here tonight so we we we make promises brother Gideon we break we're humans but God When God Says something when God makes a promise you guarantee it it's going to take place it's going to happen all things are possible to them that believe he says we got untapped resources of God at our hands to display God right Hallelujah we are Sons and Daughters of God so healing is yours Deliverance is yours what do you have need of tonight it's yours there's power that comes with that name what happens when the name of Jesus Is Spoken what happens we know what happened the first time it was spoken we're com up on Christmas season she might as well say something about it when Mary was told she's gonna have a child she gets all excited and goes to Elizabeth because Elizabeth was also expecting too but her baby was dead six months Mary's all excited she goes I'm going to have a baby and his name's going to be Jesus Oh Brother the first time that name was ever mentioned a baby received the Holy Ghost that baby who had been dead for six months came to life y don't know how excited I am it's all in that name power in his name you remember the story when Jesus sent the 70 out to preach and heal the sick and cast out Devils what they did they come back rejoicing Lord the devils are subject unto us through thy name he's okay they like Whoa man what power power we have we just mentioned your name Jesus and Devils flee they couldn't believe it the Devils were subject to the name of Jesus it's all in that name in his name there is power so the only way you're going to have power over Satan is take his name the Bible says look unto me and be ye saved all the end of the Earth for I am God and there is none else I have sworn by myself and the word has gone out of my mouth in right and shall not return that unto me every knee shall bow every tongue shall swear one of script we read wherefore God is O exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow things in heaven things in Earth things under the Earth so every Devil's gonna have to bow before that name it don't matter who they are atheist is going to Bow every person will bow what a name such a powerful name that he named his family after the name of Jesus brother brother said what think you of Christ but it was what Jesus did and what he was who was Jesus he was a very Heart Of God what makes his name so reverent tonight that all the family in heaven is named after him in the second seal he said he died the cruelest death didn't have a place to lay his head and when God exalted him so high till he has to look down to see Heaven God in humility he gave him a name so great that the whole family of Heaven is named after him and every family on the earth is named after him all the family Earth is named Jesus all the families in heaven is nam Jesus and such a name that every knee will bow amen if you're a part of God I just said your name was M Jesus Christ BR Brown says this there's many fine women in the building tonight fine loyal women but there's only one Mrs brandham she's the one that goes home with me she's the one that's my wife he's there fine people in the world fine churches but there's one mes Jesus Christ and that's who he's coming for that's where his name lays this is where his worship is in her and her alone Hallelujah that is true that's why we all we do in word or deed we do it in the name of Jesus Christ there is no other name given under heaven for salvation but the name of Jesus Christ so what is your name what are you named after whatever you're whatever you're named after you'll manifest it you'll act like it oh wow so if you're named after God you're a God you are identified by what and who you are so if you smoke cigarettes you're a what you're a smoker simple if you drink alcohol what are you you're a drunk if you look like the world what are you you're worldly just a bunch of addictions that all that is it's all in that name when I say Satan we know who he is so if your name's Satan tonight you your will is do his will if your name is Satan T that why you doing in church you'll talk like him you'll act like him you'll be him Lord have mercy just like these old Earthly addictions if you're addicted to the devil you will manifest his attributes you'll cuss you'll lie you'll act like the devil Hallelujah but if you're named after God you'll follow God you'll be God you'll act like God all that God does you'll do you'll love everybody somebody comes to you and starts gossip about people you'll zip it cuz God oh Hallelujah I'm just addicted to God I'm addicted to my husband I walk like him I want to talk like him I want to be him I want to be so much like God and when I go into Walmart into Lo or wherever I go somebody says there's something about different about that man there's something different about him I remember being working back in John in the hospital I'd go in the operating rooms people start cussing talking dirty in front of me I didn't have to say a word somebody don't even know me says I don't think this man likes to hear that stuff maybe we should keep it clean in here that worked for about five minutes and they forgot about me but I want that testimony it's all in his name that's the only reason I can do it Brad y can't go around act like God I got to have a name change power in his name in my name they shall cast out Devils that's the name of the father he put his name in Jesus Christ and in him he meets to Worship in him he meets to cast out devils in him he meets to heal the sick in him he meets to save in him he meets to save and fill with the Holy Ghost that's God's only place to meet people for worship now we find that Jesus said that the word the name Jesus he says means Jehovah savior Jehovah the savior in you is where God puts his name how many wants the devil to know who you are tonight don't worry he already does he already knows who you are he's watching the video scan the audience so the devil knows who's all here oh he's here he's sitting back in the back back there brother Luther kick him out we don't want to be like the sons of ska remember remember the story there they try to cast out the devil huh don't thing them devil says Paul we know who are you oh gosh I'd hate that to be asked me if I go laying my hands on somebody the Devil comes out says who are you I believe I hit the altar do you want to get the devil's attention start casting out his demons he don't care if you come to church it's when you start defeat him and start overcoming everything he throws against you then he hate you then he's attacking you long as you sit here and you're still doing the things of the world you're not completely surrendered the devil ain't fighting you these people left this message say I'm so free I don't have to fight a battle I'd hate that to be my testimony brother Steve what happened to Peter when he preached on the day of Pentecost 3,000 got saved the devil didn't say a word it wasn't until the very next day when he was walking by the gate and seen that man that no doubt Jesus walked by dozens of times Jesus could have healed him but he wanted somebody to use his name Peter says Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have in the name of Jesus so the first time this name was used in that way a crippled man be crippled for years rose up and walked all by the power of the name of Jesus the power of the name of Jesus that got the devil mad they who is this man just a few days ago he did not even knowing who Jesus was I don't even know the man's name till he got in the upper room he become the name he becomes the name Peter and John healed the lame man by invoking the name of Jesus it was not by their power but through faith in his name brother said faith in that name unlocks every promise of God it's not magic abracadabra it's not magic it's a relationship with the one who B s that name what happened after Peter healed by the word of God healed that man we find out he gets a boldness about him you know we I said before but Peter had denied him even knowing him he got bolded when he got the Holy Ghost he got power he got boldness about him he got the devil stirred up he went to the temple started preaching he said you're the one that crucified him his name is Jesus he's the only way you can get saved oh they got mad and threw him in prison am got the devil worked up I like to work up the devil tonight I the devil know who I am I'm not Brad y i stand here representing Christ I am Vis Jesus Christ Jesus wasn't surprised about the devil fleeing out of these people Jesus wasn't surprised the disciples come back says I just said your name and every demon fled from me I just surprise Jesus what he said I beheld Satan's lightning fall from Heaven he ain't nobody I was there when I kicked him out Jesus said I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven to be a spectator of so God witnessed himself kicking Satan Out of Heaven Hallelujah I'm hurrying behold I have given to you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions he has given you privilege he has given you superum you're a superhuman Chris we got more than what Superman's got he might con see through buildings one day we're going to fly through them oh Hallelujah you have authority you got the authority by his name you got authority to trample on every serpent you have the authority to trample on every devil there is power in us to say no to the devil Hallelujah you know when you growing up kids I don't know if they still do it now but brother Michael we was in school they had us saying say no to drugs we can to have a slogan today say no to the devil when the devil says oh Lord I forgot to set my alarm that's what the devil says the devil will say go ahead you're by yourself in your room no nobody ever know wow where'd that come from you have the power to overcome this these are a curse these are a blessing that's right between these two things right here alone I have over 80 Bibles right so these things can do a lot of good Power To Tread On The Serpent you know you say power Satan has a power the only Power the devil has over you is death oh you want to quote Satan has a power and that power is death he has a power of death and Satan is the only one that can take your life when God will let him do it but God can hold your life and Satan cannot take it until God lets him he can only use that power as God will let him use it I like he say isn't that wonderful and the church said death you know someone said what is death God harnessed death up to a buggy here's only Power Satan's got on you he'll just harness death up to a buggy the only thing death can do is pull you into the presence of the maker Hallelujah we found out his power he had power and that power was nothing but death he had no power beyond that so death ends his power I'm G say it again you've been given authority to defeat the Devil you have the authority Jesus says not withstanding this Rejoice not oh Hallelujah I laid hands on somebody was blind and it opened up their eyes what a miracle seen Miracles you've done them your brothers pray for people seen God move for them I remember down in Nicaragua praying for a young girl who couldn't speak or hear we had prayer for her and in 15 minutes that girl was doing both don't tell me God don't do Miracles I've seen him with his own eyes Hallelujah don't get excited because you see all that but Rejoice that your names are written in heaven that's why you got power cuz your name's written there your names are written written means to grave your name is engraved in the palm of his hands can a woman forget her child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yay they may forget but I won't forget you oh what a love he has for us what a love he has for us you are what brought God down to earth it was you who he took up a piece of Flesh stepped into a little bit baby for you Hallelujah so he can give you his name Hallelujah where's our love for him sometimes we can't even come to church I'm so tired I am too where's the love for him we should have so much love that we can't wait for the doors to be unlocked we should be sitting here waiting on brother Charles and get that back door unlocked we should be beating on the door let us in we want to hear some from God tonight that was in here behold I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hands that's to hack you remember Jesus died on the cross they put that Nails in his hands he looks at those scars you're engraved in there you're engraved in there I might said this before over 20 years ago happened I was ripping a piece of plywood on a table saw and is a big 4 by8 sheet which is crazy to do by yourself don't don't do it I was pushed through and it fell over and i r my hand across there to stop it and when I did the blade caught these two fingers went to the bone with them it's been over 20 years every time I look at those scars it's like I just did it yesterday I remember sometimes if I hit it just right you can still feel it the cold hurts it sometimes I remember what I did I haven't done it again I'm scared of that them table saws I seen sister Rachel ripping some by herself today I was like oh dear [Laughter] Jesus but when God looks at that scar he remembers we forget my wife will tell me I need to pick something up from the store I'll say well I tell you what at 4:00 text me I won't read your text because I know I got to pick something up because I open a text I I just close it don't read it and I forget all about it so I got to set myself an alarm as well pick up some paper towels Hallelujah but when God looks at that he rememb remembers that blood dripping down his head he remembers gosh when he looks at he doesn't forget you when you get a scar there's blood involved there was definitely blood involved when I got this there was blood on the walls blood on freshly painted ceilings Blood on the carpet there was blood involved when Jesus got this scar in his hands there was blood involved Hallelujah he can't forget you he looks at his hand and sees your name written there my Father which gave them to me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my hand let's go ahead and remind the devil I like to do this every time just remind the devil that before he was you were your name was associated with Jesus when he was slain before the foundation of the world he's not going to forget you before there was Angels before there was Stars before there was an earth before there was a devil you were there with God before there was a devil your name was wrote in the Lamb's Book of life Jesus was slain before the world even had the first Speck of dirt laid Jesus was already slayed why because God he said here it is God by for knowledge when he was the word in the beginning he perceived the thought now it's just a thought when he spoke it he said it shall be Jesus Jesus was slain the very minute God spoke that word then what 4,000 years later he came and paid that price all the devils in Hell couldn't keep him from coming CU God had already spoken God says I'm going to have a bride who's going to have my name no devil in hell can stop it it's going to happen because he spoke it have you got your joy shoes on he says listen to this if you're a CH somebody does if you are a Christian if you are a truly a God child how many God Childs are here tonight what about the rest of you if you are truly a God child your names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world the same time that God the same time that c that God said Christ will be slain he wrote your name with hisen he didn't go to the board and say Jesus Christ Brad y Ethan was no when he wrote Jesus Christ your name was right there on that first line because your name Ethan is not may not be Ethan in heaven because you GNA have a new name what is going to be our name I don't know brother Matt might know he could tell you later when he wrote Jesus Christ's name he wrote your name right then we've heard all these before but I'm not here to bring nothing new I'm here to stir up your mind in a way of remembrance Hallelujah there you are your name was written God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life by his spoken word and sent Christ to buy it the same God that before the foundation the world called your name and wrote it in the Lamb's Book of Life in the book from the foundation of the world has already made a place in glory for you so why do we go with our head down worryed about things that we can't do nothing about oh God you going to be able to help me can you help me God I don't know from before the foundation I'm giving you another one for the foundation of the world God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life all the devils in hell can't erase it it's God's word he already spoke it Hallelujah we just walk around our heads depress depressed we're so depressed we let anxiety sit in oh come to me that's what Jesus says come to me your name's written in heaven I'll take care of that anxiety your name's written in heaven I'll take care of that depression your name's written in heaven I'll take care of that lust Hallelujah when your name is written in heaven in the Lamb's Book of Life sin is not imputed to your name Hallelujah scripture Romans 4:8 says blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin he don't even think of you that way Brother Don he don't even think of your old past life Hallelujah this is what God thinks of you before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee before thou cometh forth to the womb I sanctify thee for I know the thoughts that I thinket toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of Peace not of evil to give you an expected end it's an end he knows what he's expecting it he can't wait for it to happen and expected in his thoughts of you are Eternal he don't think anything bad of you well we think a a lot of bad about ourselves because our mind is constantly on you did this the other day Satan rushing up into heaven your name done this today Hallelujah but I thank God brother Matt that when I ask forgiveness for something I truly repent it's in the sea of God's forgiveness to be remembered no more yet we remember and the devil will use that against us the devil will use it against against you I know I know what I'm talking about then you shall call on me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you we'll skip a little bit I want one more quote the same time the lamb was spoke to be slain and the blood stain was appropriated then your name was associated with it at that very time and put in the Lamb's Book of Life think of it before the world was ever formed when the Lamb's Book of Life was spoke back there your name was Associated to it amen your name was associated with the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ what are you scared about he says he's up there on the receiving end oh Hallelujah that reminds me of brother Brandon talk about being lost in the world Wilderness I'm a God there's no
