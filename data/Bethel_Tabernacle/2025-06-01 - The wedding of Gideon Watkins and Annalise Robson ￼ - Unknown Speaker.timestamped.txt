[15:14] friends and
[15:15] family gathered here today in the sight
[15:18] of God and this company who loves and
[15:21] cherishes Gideon and Anna. But there's
[15:24] something very special, very sacred, a
[15:28] covenant between a man and a woman
[15:30] that's by the people who have shaped
[15:33] them, loved them, raised them, and
[15:36] prayed for this very moment to happen.
[15:39] We know that marriage is not just a
[15:41] beautiful ceremony, but it's a divine
[15:44] institution created by God himself.
[15:48] Apostle Paul taught us that marriage is
[15:49] honorable and holy. It's a picture of
[15:53] God's union between him and his bride.
[15:56] Jesus honored marriage and he performed
[15:58] his first miracle at a wedding. So, we
[16:01] know he celebrates these kind of
[16:03] moments. We recognize today that true
[16:06] love, the kind that last for
[16:09] eternity, is in and of itself a miracle.
[16:12] It's more than affection. It's more than
[16:15] attraction.
[16:17] It's a deep sacred love that only God
[16:20] can give and he pours it into our hearts
[16:23] by his
[16:24] spirit. This kind of love where one man
[16:27] loves one woman, one woman loves one man
[16:31] exclusively, faithfully, and forever.
[16:35] It's not something that we enter into
[16:37] lightly, but it should be entered into
[16:39] and approached very reverently with
[16:42] prayer and with deep respect for the one
[16:45] who designed it. Today, my son Gideon
[16:49] and Anna have come not just to be
[16:52] celebrated, but to be joined together in
[16:55] this holy covenant before
[16:58] God. At this time, if there's anyone who
[17:00] knows of any reason why these two should
[17:02] not be joined together, you're asked to
[17:04] speak now or forever hold your peace.
[17:07] And also, I ask this of both of you,
[17:09] Gideon and Anna. You know, of any reason
[17:12] of this union would be unlawful before
[17:15] God speak.
[17:19] Who gives this woman to be married to
[17:21] this man?
[17:36] turn face each other.
[17:42] Today is a very very special day for me
[17:47] and um it's been quite emotional already
[17:49] and for me and Rachel just to see Gideon
[17:52] here and Anna all of our here. We had
[17:55] just a moment before we came
[17:57] out just to in celebration of this
[18:00] moment that we're sharing in as I have
[18:03] the privilege of burying my oldest son
[18:05] Gideon that we are so proud of what the
[18:09] Lord has done in his
[18:10] life.
[18:13] Gideon, this is an awesome moment. What
[18:16] an incredible moment. One that really is
[18:19] better than any Hallmark story. one that
[18:22] really only the Lord could have put
[18:25] together. Gideon, it was just last
[18:28] October, just last October that Anna
[18:32] came into your life. I can't speak very
[18:34] much because that was very much helpful
[18:36] at work very quick and the arrow of love
[18:40] struck your heart and uh Anna he just
[18:44] simply hasn't been able to think about
[18:45] anything else but you from that
[18:49] moment getting me and
[18:51] mom vividly remember you may be seated
[18:54] here we vividly
[18:57] remember that night if you did just uh
[19:01] last October
[19:03] almost 2:00 in the morning. We were
[19:05] exhausted, ready to go to bed. Didn't
[19:08] want to do anything but go to sleep.
[19:10] Exhausted from just the day. But Gideon
[19:12] wasn't going to take no for an answer.
[19:14] He had to see us. He had to see us right
[19:17] then and there. We had to sit in the
[19:19] car. He had to tell us because he was
[19:21] bursting and exploding with uh joy. He
[19:25] wanted to tell us to say get dad, mom, I
[19:28] know that I know that I know that he
[19:30] said it 10 times that I have found the
[19:32] one God has for
[19:34] me. And we knew that you knew that you
[19:36] knew that you knew that you had found
[19:39] the right one. But Gideon, you had just
[19:40] met her just at that moment. What we
[19:43] said, Gideon, are you sure? But boy, he
[19:46] was sure. Dad, I know. I know. God has
[19:48] shown me this is the real one. And you
[19:50] know what? You were right, Gideon. You
[19:52] were right. Anna, it was just this
[19:54] February, just this February or January,
[19:57] the end of January, you were surprised
[20:00] on a trip to North Carolina when Gideon
[20:02] asked you to marry
[20:04] him. I'll never forget that moment you
[20:07] guys return home from that trip, us
[20:11] knowing you were engaged, and you all
[20:13] come in the door 10:00, all the kids
[20:15] filed in, and here comes Gideon. And
[20:18] something happened that uh I can't
[20:21] explain. just as the Lord. But when you
[20:24] walked in the door, I can describe it as
[20:28] is that the way I looked at you was not
[20:30] as my son's girlfriend or fiance, but it
[20:33] felt like one of my daughters. That was
[20:35] a very special moment. And I know that
[20:38] God has truly brought grandson life when
[20:41] he gave us.
[20:43] Brother Brandham, in the sermon, Kinsman
[20:45] Redeemer 1960 says, "Hatred had a
[20:48] beginning, so it has to have an end.
[20:52] Love had no beginning, so it has no end.
[20:55] Hatred is forever. Love is eternal.
[20:59] Hatred begins and hatred will end. Lover
[21:02] love never did begin. It will never end.
[21:05] See, it was eternal. And when a man
[21:07] loves a woman and marries her just
[21:09] because she's pretty, there will be an
[21:10] end to that. But when a man finds a
[21:13] woman that he loves, he don't know why,
[21:14] but he loves her. She finds a man that
[21:16] she loves. No matter what he looks like,
[21:18] he he loves her. She loves him. That's
[21:20] an eternal fate. In glory, death nor
[21:23] nothing else can ever separate them
[21:26] because they are from eternity. They
[21:29] stepped out into the space of time and
[21:32] will return back to eternity. Eternity
[21:35] is dropped down into a body called time.
[21:38] Then it goes right back up.
[21:41] [Music]
[21:47] This time we're going to just have to
[21:50] repeat after
[21:55] another.
[21:57] Gideon, will you have this woman Hannah
[22:00] to be your wed wife to live with her in
[22:04] the holy covenant of marriage? Will you
[22:07] love her, comfort her, honor and protect
[22:10] her in sickness and in health, in joy
[22:14] and in sorrow, and forsaking all
[22:22] others? Anna, will you have this man
[22:25] Gideon to be your wed husband to live
[22:28] with him in the holy covenant of
[22:30] marriage? Will you love him, support
[22:33] him, respect and stand beside him in
[22:35] sickness and in health, in joy and in
[22:38] sorrow, and forsaking all others, be
[22:40] faithful to him as long as you both
[22:42] shall live. I do.
[22:45] I want you to repeat after me. I Gideon
[22:48] take you, Hannah. I Gideon, take you
[22:50] Hannah, to be my wed wife. to be my wed
[22:53] wife. According to all of God's holy
[22:55] ordinance. according to all of God's
[22:57] holy ordinance. I promise to lead you to
[23:01] the leadership from the Lord. with the
[23:03] leadership from the Lord. with love and
[23:05] humility from this day forward. with
[23:07] love and humility from this day forward.
[23:09] To have and to hold. To have and to
[23:11] hold. To love and to cherish. To love
[23:13] and to cherish. For better or for worse.
[23:15] For better or for worse. For richer, for
[23:17] poor. For richer. And sickness and
[23:20] health. And sickness and health. I take
[23:26] that. Repeat after me. I am to I am to
[23:31] be to be my wed husband. to be my wed
[23:35] husband. According to God's holy
[23:37] ordinance according to God or to submit
[23:40] myself to your leadership to submit
[23:42] yourself to your leadership as unto the
[23:44] Lord and unto the Lord. And to walk
[23:46] beside you as my covenant to
[23:48] [Music]
[23:51] walk in this
[23:59] [Music]
[24:06] sickness until death do
[24:23] [Music]
[24:28] Maybe that's
[24:33] [Music]
[24:40] [Music]
[24:45] These rings are simple in design but
[24:47] rich in meaning. They're circles without
[24:50] an end symbolizing love that is unending
[24:53] and
[24:57] eternal. Let's pray.
[25:00] Lord Jesus, we ask your blessing on
[25:03] these
[25:04] rings, symbols of your eternal
[25:07] love. Lord, may they be a host
[25:10] of the sacred promises that are made
[25:12] this day. Bless this Lord in Jesus name.
[25:18] Amen.
[25:26] Repeat after
[25:29] with this ring I be wet in the name of
[25:33] the Lord Jesus
[25:34] [Music]
[25:39] Christ with
[25:41] this I
[25:44] the name of the Lord Jesus
[25:46] Christ let's
[25:49] pray
[25:51] Jesus nameus
[25:54] that cannot be broken. Seal this
[25:57] covenant, Lord, by your spirit. May
[25:59] their marriage be a testimony of your
[26:01] grace in Jesus name. Amen.
[26:07] [Music]
[26:10] Because Gideon and and Anna have made
[26:12] their vows to each other, have sealed
[26:14] them with rings, and have committed
[26:16] yourselves to this covenant before God.
[26:18] These witnesses, by the authority given
[26:21] to me as a servant of the Lord, I now
[26:24] pronounce you husband and wife in the
[26:27] name of Jesus Christ.
[26:30] Oh yeah, you can kiss your
[26:35] [Music]
[26:39] Family and
[26:40] friends, it is my great honor and joy to
[26:44] present to you Mr. and Miss Gideon
[26:49] [Applause]
[27:02] Watkins. Work on the road. They took
[27:06] forever on the road like memories of the
[27:11] miles we shared
[27:14] between the place you learn to say your
[27:18] prayers. The place I took to
[27:21] praying in breaking down my
[27:25] road dreams.
[27:28] Come before we ever made a
[27:49] direction and
[27:53] never

[27:58] And I ain't a
[28:00] lion and I'm all
[28:03] yours. You're all mine. There ain't two
[28:08] ways around it. There ain't no trying
[28:11] about
[28:13] it. I'm all
[28:16] yours. You're all mine.
[28:20] [Music]
[28:39] [Music]
[28:49] boards. If you're able, you please bring
[28:51] your chair with you to the reception
[28:53] area. Also, the outhouse restroom is
[28:55] located right behind the garage.
[29:20] Yes, absolutely.

[29:50] actually you
[29:52] guys want
[30:12] Hey, bro.
