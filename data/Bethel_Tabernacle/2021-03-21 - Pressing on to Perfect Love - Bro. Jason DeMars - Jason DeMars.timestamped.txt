[35:22] thank you lord man
[35:27] amen god is so good
[35:30] let's uh let's turn to romans
[35:33] chapter 12 verses 9 and 10.
[35:38] this is from a sunday school that i did
[35:41] on love and friendship a while
[35:45] a while ago that brother jason wanted me
[35:47] to to repeat in a regular service
[35:50] and so some of you might have seen me
[35:52] preach at
[35:54] when i was visiting other churches
[35:57] so maybe this is the third time fourth
[35:59] time you've heard it well it's like the
[36:00] eighth time i've preached it
[36:02] and i'm going to confess i still need to
[36:05] hear it
[36:06] so if you've heard it multiple times
[36:08] it'll probably come out a little
[36:09] different as it does every time but
[36:12] i think i still need it we still need it
[36:15] so
[36:15] we're still here so amen talking about
[36:18] pressing on to perfect
[36:20] love romans 12 9
[36:23] and 10 let love be without dissimulation
[36:28] abhor that which is evil cleave
[36:31] to that which is good be kindly
[36:34] affection one to another with brotherly
[36:36] love
[36:37] in honor preferring one another
[36:40] amen let's pray heavenly father we just
[36:44] come to your lord and we're so thankful
[36:45] for your
[36:46] beautiful word we're so thankful for
[36:51] the spirit of god that dwells within us
[36:54] by the baptism of the holy ghost and the
[36:56] new birth
[36:59] lord and that spirit which guides us
[37:01] into all truth
[37:03] so lord would you come and and be our
[37:05] teacher today
[37:07] would you come and dwell within us lord
[37:09] and
[37:10] and speak to us in a mighty way lord and
[37:13] and deal with our hearts in a mighty way
[37:16] lord we thank you so much for all the
[37:18] good
[37:19] gifts that you give to us lord and in
[37:22] the form of
[37:23] the people that are amongst us lord and
[37:27] the singing and the musicians and the
[37:29] specials lord we're
[37:31] we're so blessed we we thank you lord
[37:35] and
[37:35] we ask that you would be glorified and
[37:37] your name would be lifted up we ask in
[37:38] jesus name
[37:39] amen god bless you can be seated
[37:44] so let love be without dissimulation let
[37:47] it be without
[37:48] hypocrisy
[37:51] so it's not a it's not a fake love that
[37:54] paul
[37:55] is calling for he's calling for a
[37:57] genuine
[37:58] thing from the heart
[38:03] not something that has a put on not
[38:05] something that's a show
[38:07] but this something that's the same at
[38:09] home
[38:11] and at the church and at the office
[38:15] and on the street something that's
[38:18] genuine real
[38:21] from the heart not because you have to
[38:25] but because god has put it inside of you
[38:29] then he says in in this thank you
[38:32] brother tony
[38:32] abhor that which is evil and
[38:36] cleave to that which is good isn't it
[38:39] strange
[38:40] he says let love be without
[38:41] dissimulation hate
[38:44] what is evil
[38:47] cleave hold on to what is good
[38:51] so how does that work we have to have
[38:53] love and we have to hate evil
[38:56] at the same time how does it work we
[39:00] have a god
[39:02] who is full of love full of compassion
[39:04] we have a god
[39:06] who loves even even the sinner
[39:09] he provides for their needs he does good
[39:11] to them he's merciful to them
[39:14] and at the same time he hates what
[39:17] they're doing
[39:18] or even says he hates the workers of
[39:20] iniquity
[39:21] amen but he provides for their needs
[39:24] he's good to them his mercy
[39:27] endures long and suffers long in other
[39:30] words he's offering something to them
[39:32] over and over and over and over and over
[39:34] again and he still doesn't condemn
[39:37] he's slow to anger so
[39:40] how can we do that because the god
[39:44] that does that lives inside of us
[39:48] cleave to that which is good it's like
[39:50] grab a hold of it and hold on to it with
[39:52] all your might
[39:54] be kindly affection one
[39:57] to another with brotherly love
[40:01] be kindly affection we'll talk about
[40:03] that more later i don't want to go into
[40:04] that that's
[40:05] that's going to be connected to
[40:06] something else so this is from
[40:09] adoption 1960. brother banham says
[40:13] thus saith the lord so we should stop
[40:16] and go okay
[40:18] i'm listening this is not brother
[40:20] branham speaking
[40:22] this is god speaking it'll take perfect
[40:25] love to put you in that place
[40:26] for that's all there was there no matter
[40:29] what money
[40:30] how much religious demonstrations how
[40:33] many good deeds you've done or whatever
[40:34] you've done
[40:35] that won't count nothing on that day
[40:38] it'll take perfect love so whatever you
[40:41] do you lay aside everything else until
[40:44] you're just so
[40:45] filled with the love of god till you can
[40:47] love those who
[40:49] hate you
[40:53] wow perfect love
[40:57] not just the ones that are nice to you
[41:00] that fit the mold of being a correct
[41:04] message believer but everybody
[41:07] the rotten ones the filthy ones the ones
[41:10] that get on your nerves
[41:13] everyone the ones that despise you that
[41:16] speak your name as a curse word
[41:21] you're supposed to love those ones too
[41:24] your heart and attitude shouldn't
[41:26] change between them
[41:29] the world that we live in and even
[41:32] christians are constantly
[41:34] trying to redefine what love
[41:38] is of course this world order this world
[41:41] system
[41:41] has totally perverted it it simply means
[41:45] lust it's a feeling
[41:48] it's an emotion but it's way
[41:52] light years beyond that it's completely
[41:56] different from that you can there
[41:58] there's emotions that come
[42:00] with love there's things that follow
[42:04] love but they are not love they're just
[42:07] outworkings of love
[42:10] in the new testament there's four
[42:13] different words that are used for love
[42:15] one is storge
[42:16] which means family love one is filio
[42:18] which means
[42:19] brotherly or friendship love there's
[42:22] eros which is
[42:23] love between a couple passion and then
[42:26] there's agape which is
[42:28] unconditional love
[42:31] so when i was i just want to share a
[42:34] testimony i was working at
[42:37] u.s bank in in minnesota and i
[42:40] just to give you a picture of let love
[42:43] be
[42:44] without dissimulation abhor that which
[42:46] is evil cleave to that which is good
[42:48] um so you can understand what it means
[42:51] to
[42:51] to be strongly opposed to something
[42:55] and yet still love that person and it's
[42:58] not because it's me
[43:02] it's not because it's me it's because
[43:04] this is what the lord did in this
[43:05] person's life
[43:07] in my life i probably more than anything
[43:10] but i was working with a homosexual
[43:12] guy and he was just out in the open
[43:15] just um talking about it and so forth
[43:18] and
[43:19] when i was there working with him we
[43:20] worked in a it was one of those grocery
[43:22] store
[43:23] branches so it's small everyone knows
[43:26] everything about everyone's life kind of
[43:28] places
[43:30] and so one one day i think it was on a
[43:34] saturday just the two of us were there
[43:37] working the teller line and opening
[43:39] accounts and so forth
[43:40] and we were talking and of course he
[43:42] knew my testimony he knew
[43:44] what i believed and we were talking
[43:46] about
[43:48] why the trinity was false and we were
[43:50] talking about
[43:52] denominations and uh he was really
[43:56] actually enjoying the conversation and
[43:58] then uh
[44:02] we started he started talking about his
[44:04] life
[44:05] and i just mentioned i said well as a
[44:08] bible-believing christian i'm
[44:09] sure you're aware of what my
[44:12] understanding of
[44:13] homosexuality is that's it's a sin
[44:17] it's it's not something that's it's not
[44:19] right he's like well i know that
[44:22] and he said i've been to i've been to a
[44:24] catholic
[44:25] um priest to be
[44:28] have an exorcism and i've been to a
[44:31] pentecostal charismatic church and he's
[44:33] like nothing
[44:35] none of that stuff worked and i just
[44:37] said well have you ever been to jesus
[44:40] have you ever come to him wow and
[44:43] he got kind of got shocked for a second
[44:46] and i said
[44:49] look i you know you know
[44:52] that i believe that what you're doing is
[44:54] wrong and it's a sin
[44:55] but you also know that i love you and i
[44:58] care about you
[45:00] and and i said god god can deliver you
[45:03] the
[45:03] question is is it coming to jason or the
[45:06] priest
[45:07] or the pentecostal uh evangelist
[45:10] that's not going to save you it's coming
[45:14] to jesus christ he's the one that can
[45:17] change your change your life well
[45:19] this conversation ended he appreciated
[45:22] he was he was grateful for me pointing
[45:24] him in the right direction
[45:25] i don't know whatever happened to him
[45:27] but later on we had an
[45:29] atheist that worked in this this branch
[45:31] also
[45:32] he really hated me and he was always
[45:36] trying to fight with me he was always
[45:38] trying to to
[45:39] stir up something and then he would talk
[45:41] behind my back to the other
[45:43] employees well he was doing that to this
[45:46] homosexual man
[45:47] and the homosexual man tells me well
[45:51] he tells this guy you are you cannot
[45:54] speak
[45:55] like to jason about jason like that in
[45:58] front of me
[46:00] and he's like why not you're you're
[46:03] you're homosexual he said jason is the
[46:07] most tolerant person
[46:08] i have ever met and i thought what in
[46:12] the world i told the guy
[46:15] it's a sin and you're going to hell
[46:18] if you continue in sin and yet
[46:22] he could see beyond that that i cared
[46:24] about
[46:25] his soul his heart and i think that's
[46:28] what
[46:29] that is not me i'm not trying to lift
[46:32] myself up
[46:33] because i've i could tell you about all
[46:34] the times i've failed too
[46:36] but in this circumstance the lord was
[46:38] gracious to me
[46:39] and allowed me to be a testimony to to
[46:42] this man
[46:44] and i think that's that's what the lord
[46:47] wants us to be he wants us to be a
[46:49] presence
[46:51] of truth but overarching
[46:55] love so that once someone comes into
[46:57] your presence like we talked about
[46:59] creating an atmosphere you're a little
[47:02] elohim
[47:04] you're a little god an amateur god there
[47:07] should be a supernatural
[47:09] atmosphere of love permeating from your
[47:12] life
[47:13] from your family so that other people
[47:15] walk into it
[47:17] and they're brought to tears because of
[47:19] it
[47:20] because they don't see that another
[47:22] place
[47:23] love that's that's what it should be not
[47:26] that this guy's always rebuking me every
[47:28] time i see him
[47:29] it might be that too sometimes people
[47:32] are angry with god and they just come
[47:34] around you
[47:35] and they can't stand it you never
[47:37] rebuked him you're just living a godly
[47:39] life and
[47:40] it rebukes them so there's all these
[47:42] responses
[47:43] but overarching they should know that
[47:46] person loves me
[47:50] not that we're rebuking him all the time
[47:52] that person hates me
[47:54] there could be rebukes absolutely i gave
[47:57] the man
[47:58] the homosexual man a rebuke but that's
[48:00] not how he received it because there was
[48:02] something behind that
[48:04] that went to his heart amen
[48:10] love is not find its source in emotions
[48:14] emotions change right emotions are like
[48:18] this
[48:19] all of us probably went like this this
[48:21] week
[48:22] and then and then
[48:26] and then maybe maybe you were just like
[48:27] no brother jason i was just like this
[48:29] really low the whole week brother luther
[48:32] is really
[48:33] on the top level cloud nine
[48:37] every time i see him text him talk to
[48:39] him
[48:40] but someday he might go down just a
[48:42] little bit
[48:44] and when you go down just a little bit
[48:46] you'll need this message brother luther
[48:52] but our emotions they get weaker they
[48:54] get stronger
[48:55] they ebb they flow in marriage
[48:59] which one of you has always 100 of the
[49:02] time had butterflies
[49:03] in your heart for your wife
[49:06] if you raise your hand or your husband
[49:09] if you raise your hand
[49:11] i won't say what you are
[49:19] the fact is we get upset we get
[49:21] frustrated
[49:22] people do things we don't like and it
[49:25] wrangle
[49:25] wrangles our feathers and that is where
[49:29] real love comes
[49:32] and it has to be there in our hearts
[49:34] romans 5 verse 5 brother gideon
[49:38] it cannot be merely an emotion because
[49:41] love is not merely an emotion
[49:45] true love both filio
[49:49] and agape are not merely emotions
[49:53] there's something deeper there romans 5
[49:57] verse 5 and
[49:58] hope maketh not ashamed because the
[50:01] love the agape of god is shed
[50:04] abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost
[50:06] which is given unto
[50:08] us our love for one another finds its
[50:11] source in the love
[50:12] of god that's been placed within us
[50:15] by what by the baptism of the holy ghost
[50:17] the true
[50:18] and genuine baptism of the holy ghost
[50:21] not just merely an anointing
[50:23] but the real thing the agape of god is
[50:26] placed in our hearts so now when you
[50:29] have the holy ghost you're a candidate
[50:32] to grow into perfect love
[50:36] this word shed abroad there means to
[50:39] to pour forth to gush out to run
[50:43] greedily out so this is the love of god
[50:46] it's poured
[50:47] into us as a vessel and then how does it
[50:50] get to other people
[50:51] it just spills out because it's just
[50:53] pouring and pouring and pouring into us
[50:56] and it's gushing over and it's getting
[50:57] on other people
[51:00] first thessalonians 3 verse 12
[51:06] and the lord make you to
[51:09] increase and abound in love
[51:13] one toward another and toward all men
[51:16] even as we do towards you
[51:20] so the lord make you increase in other
[51:22] words
[51:23] you have the love of god but we have to
[51:26] grow
[51:27] we have to increase in the love of god
[51:30] you can't just
[51:31] any person that says well i have the
[51:33] love of god
[51:34] what are you talking about i don't need
[51:35] to grow in the love of god
[51:38] i don't have the love of god to start
[51:39] with all of us
[51:42] realize our own weakness
[51:45] that we need or we should if you don't
[51:47] pray that you do
[51:50] but you need each of us need to grow in
[51:54] the love of god increa it has to
[51:56] increase
[51:58] and when it increases what does it need
[51:59] to do abound
[52:02] towards towards one another and toward
[52:05] all men
[52:06] oops not just towards believers not just
[52:09] towards bride
[52:10] everybody who are we supposed to love
[52:12] who's this neighbor that we're supposed
[52:14] to love
[52:16] every single person on planet earth
[52:20] that's our neighbor that we're supposed
[52:21] to love
[52:25] matthew 5 43.
[52:35] you have heard that's been said you
[52:38] shall love your neighbor and hate your
[52:39] enemy
[52:41] but i say unto you love your enemies
[52:45] okay all right here was here's what
[52:47] we're supposed to do
[52:48] love your enemies bless them
[52:51] that curse you so people that speak
[52:54] against you
[52:55] that hate you that curse at you
[52:58] what should you do get angry and fight
[53:00] back right
[53:03] bless them in other words god bless you
[53:06] i have heard it said
[53:07] i wouldn't want to say god bless you to
[53:09] that person because of
[53:10] dot dot dot and i get that there's a
[53:12] scripture that says don't
[53:14] someone that has is a false teacher
[53:17] don't even wish them
[53:18] god speed but all things in balance
[53:21] there are circumstances for that but
[53:23] here someone is cursing you
[53:25] and jesus says bless him
[53:28] god bless you
[53:31] do good to them that
[53:34] hate you and pray for them which
[53:36] despitefully use you
[53:38] and persecute you our heart should not
[53:40] merely be
[53:42] loving people in other words doing nice
[53:44] things for people
[53:46] because they can do it back to us
[53:50] jesus says when you make a feast invite
[53:52] people
[53:53] that cannot pay you back in other words
[53:56] invite people that can't invite you to
[53:57] their feast
[53:59] invite and i'm guilty
[54:03] we invite our friends we write our
[54:05] buddies but what about the people that
[54:08] get on our nerves that frustrate us
[54:12] we should be inviting them
[54:17] pray for them that despitefully use you
[54:19] and persecute you
[54:21] when someone's persecuting you what is
[54:23] what is the first thing we want to do
[54:26] clarify our motives and objectives
[54:29] and then what's the second thing we want
[54:31] to do argue with them
[54:34] right that's human nature but what does
[54:37] god want us to do
[54:40] pray pray for them first pray for them
[54:44] next find a way you can do something
[54:46] nice for them
[54:48] and wish them god's blessing upon
[54:51] their life why should we do that
[54:55] brother jason why should we do that that
[54:58] [Music]
[54:59] you may be the children of your father
[55:02] which is in heaven
[55:06] let that sink in for a second do you
[55:07] want to be a child of god
[55:10] then you need to do this this is what
[55:13] your life
[55:13] we understand under the gospel this is
[55:16] not something you're doing
[55:17] in your own power right you're not doing
[55:20] it
[55:21] in your own power this is not just up to
[55:23] you to do it this
[55:24] is what the spirit of god is doing in us
[55:29] not might do amen is doing in us
[55:33] you say it's not doing it in me then you
[55:35] need to get the spirit of god
[55:37] because it will do that in you that you
[55:39] might be the children of your father
[55:41] which is in heaven
[55:42] for he makes his son to rise on the evil
[55:45] and on the good
[55:46] and sends his sends rain on the just and
[55:48] on the unjust in other words god does
[55:50] this too
[55:51] he does good to his enemies too for if
[55:54] you love them which love you
[55:56] what reward have you do do not eat does
[55:59] not even the irs do the same thing
[56:04] oops doesn't even the tax collectors do
[56:07] the same thing
[56:09] and if you salute or the word means
[56:11] welcome if you welcome
[56:13] your brethren only what do you more than
[56:16] others
[56:18] don't even the tax collectors do the
[56:20] same
[56:22] be therefore perfect even as your father
[56:25] in heaven
[56:26] is perfect
[56:30] in other words you're called to
[56:31] something higher than pharisees and tax
[56:33] collectors
[56:35] what is that human nature says well i
[56:38] really like being around brother travis
[56:40] i will only invite brother travis to my
[56:42] house
[56:44] that's not scriptural
[56:47] that's not scripture i'm not trying to
[56:49] tell you who to invite to your house
[56:51] i'm just using it as an example what's
[56:54] in your heart what's in what's in your
[56:56] what's in your mind what what is our
[56:58] attitude
[57:00] to to the people that are not good to us
[57:03] we need to welcome and love
[57:07] no matter what
[57:11] in influence 1963 brother branham says
[57:14] reverence we ought
[57:15] to honor one another respect one another
[57:18] as brother sister and love one another
[57:21] with undying love
[57:23] you say well i just can't well
[57:26] just stay here in the presence of god a
[57:29] little longer and then you'll like
[57:31] people too
[57:33] you'll love those who doesn't love you
[57:35] that's real that's a really a good
[57:37] sign of christianity when you can
[57:40] from your heart love those who does not
[57:44] love you
[57:45] love the unlovable from your heart
[57:49] now that gets me
[57:52] we might be able to by wrote say jesus
[57:55] said
[57:57] love those who hate me
[58:01] pray for let's see let's get the list
[58:03] out
[58:04] love pray bless okay do good all right
[58:08] i can but i really this frustrates me
[58:12] these people make me mad no
[58:16] it's it's from your heart brother
[58:19] branham says
[58:20] and that takes it to a whole other level
[58:23] because a lot of these things it's just
[58:25] a reaction
[58:27] that person cut me off that person's
[58:30] driving like a dummy
[58:31] which happens a lot in the low country
[58:33] by the way
[58:38] what is it god's testing us to bring us
[58:42] into perfect love
[58:45] by sending bad drivers our way
[58:52] love he says love the unlovable
[58:56] jesus said if you just do favors for
[58:58] those that do favors for you well the
[59:00] publicans do the same thing but see
[59:02] you must be kind to those who are unkind
[59:04] to you
[59:06] do good for those that would do evil to
[59:08] you
[59:10] always remember that keep that before
[59:12] you that god is watching you
[59:15] remember god was good to you and you
[59:17] were evil to him
[59:19] while you were yet sinners christ died
[59:22] for you and i want to say
[59:23] that doing this it takes a special
[59:28] kind of gift in a life
[59:32] a gift of the holy ghost
[59:35] and it's for all of us it's not just for
[59:37] a few people but it takes something
[59:39] where you need to have
[59:42] a tender heart and a tough skin
[59:47] because people will treat you bad people
[59:50] will treat you wrong
[59:51] people will do things that frustrate you
[59:53] and you can't let that harden your heart
[59:57] towards them but your skin
[1:00:00] has to be tough otherwise it will
[1:00:02] destroy you
[1:00:04] it will put you in it'll put you into
[1:00:06] sickness
[1:00:07] it'll put you into bad health it'll make
[1:00:10] your nerves so bad
[1:00:11] you can't even hardly function that is
[1:00:14] not what jesus is talking about just
[1:00:16] take it and
[1:00:17] you've got bad nerves and you're sick
[1:00:19] and you can't even
[1:00:20] no it's from your heart you do it you
[1:00:23] overcome from your heart and it's
[1:00:25] it's not brother branham talks about
[1:00:27] that that these things
[1:00:28] should come automatically the
[1:00:32] dove of the holy ghost it's an oil on
[1:00:34] the inside
[1:00:35] cleans it from the inside out we don't
[1:00:38] need to go to church
[1:00:39] and get re-baptized every week because
[1:00:41] we messed up
[1:00:43] we don't need to go clean ourselves with
[1:00:45] some external thing
[1:00:47] but the holy ghost inside of us is
[1:00:50] working in us so that these things
[1:00:52] are an automatic reaction instead of the
[1:00:55] opposite one
[1:00:56] i think that's the beauty of what
[1:00:58] brother branham is talking about this is
[1:00:59] not
[1:01:01] an outward show it's not love with
[1:01:04] dissimulation it's love without
[1:01:06] dissimulation
[1:01:07] that comes from our heart so this is
[1:01:09] like this is like a really good
[1:01:11] barometer
[1:01:12] is when people treat you bad how do you
[1:01:14] respond
[1:01:16] it does it tear you up yeah that tears
[1:01:19] me up
[1:01:21] sure i get nervous i get tore up
[1:01:25] and i say lord what do you how do you
[1:01:26] want me to respond to this
[1:01:28] and he just reminds me of the same thing
[1:01:30] every single time
[1:01:32] when you were in turkey and they were
[1:01:34] trying to destroy your character
[1:01:36] what did i tell you to do okay lord
[1:01:39] when i came back and i was depressed
[1:01:42] i could barely function i thought
[1:01:44] everything was ruined
[1:01:46] you you told you showed me the psalm
[1:01:48] that says my enemies have
[1:01:50] gathered together they're round about me
[1:01:52] but i've given myself to prayer
[1:01:55] oh wow okay lord i'll give myself to
[1:01:57] prayer then i turn and look and and see
[1:01:59] what the quote of the day was and
[1:02:00] brother branham is saying
[1:02:01] sometimes you'll reach a place that you
[1:02:03] hit hit the wall there's no place to go
[1:02:05] it says don't run this way don't go that
[1:02:07] way don't try to go over it
[1:02:09] keep walking and god will make a way
[1:02:11] right through it
[1:02:13] and i just thought oh my good okay lord
[1:02:16] i just keep walking you'll you'll you'll
[1:02:19] take care of the rest
[1:02:21] lord give us that heart that's not
[1:02:24] always my
[1:02:24] reaction but it's always what the holy
[1:02:27] spirit reminds me
[1:02:29] of over and over and over again
[1:02:34] let's not defend ourselves we're not
[1:02:35] here to defend
[1:02:37] jason to mars we're not here to defend
[1:02:40] our own personal standing our own
[1:02:43] personal
[1:02:44] way we're not here to hire an
[1:02:47] image consultant
[1:02:50] we are here to reflect the image of
[1:02:52] jesus christ
[1:02:55] and it's his glory that we're working
[1:02:57] for and if people spit on us and hate us
[1:03:02] that they have to deal with that they
[1:03:04] have to deal with that
[1:03:05] it's up to us to say father
[1:03:09] we forgive you we forgive them forgive
[1:03:12] them
[1:03:14] um
[1:03:17] in the sermon living dying buried rising
[1:03:20] coming in 1959
[1:03:23] brother branham says he showed what he
[1:03:24] did to the whole human race the way god
[1:03:27] represented himself in jesus christ
[1:03:29] he expressed his opinion to the human
[1:03:31] race to forgive and to love those who
[1:03:34] were unlovable
[1:03:35] and i wonder on this easter morning how
[1:03:37] short we fall of that
[1:03:39] we could love those who love us but he
[1:03:41] loved those who did not love him
[1:03:43] he was the greatest the first
[1:03:45] representation of love
[1:03:47] that ever hit the earth and was despised
[1:03:50] of those who lived on the earth to whom
[1:03:52] he loved
[1:03:52] no man could ever love like him and no
[1:03:55] man was ever hated like him
[1:03:58] they hated him and despised him and
[1:04:00] rejected him
[1:04:01] but it did not stop his love
[1:04:04] the last when he was hanging on the
[1:04:06] cross after that life he had lived
[1:04:08] been nothing been done nothing but good
[1:04:10] things forgiving the guilty healing the
[1:04:12] sick and just
[1:04:13] things that were good when he was his
[1:04:15] last breaths on the cross with the
[1:04:17] vulgar mocking spit of them who stood by
[1:04:19] hanging from his sacred face he cried
[1:04:21] with a heart full of love
[1:04:23] father forgive them for they know not
[1:04:25] what they do
[1:04:27] he could understand being god he
[1:04:28] understands that's why he could love us
[1:04:31] when we were unlovable because he's god
[1:04:34] and he
[1:04:35] understands amen
[1:04:39] amen it just becomes very common to us
[1:04:43] that we love our friends we love those
[1:04:46] that are agreeable to us
[1:04:48] that's the norm of the whole planet
[1:04:52] but we're not supposed to live
[1:04:54] spiritually in this dimension
[1:04:56] there's another dimension that we're
[1:04:58] called to live in to walk in
[1:05:01] and that in that dimension we love
[1:05:04] all whether they meet the standards that
[1:05:08] we have
[1:05:09] for who should be loved and who
[1:05:11] shouldn't be our standards need to
[1:05:13] change to reflect the standards of our
[1:05:16] father
[1:05:19] a few scriptures to read just real
[1:05:21] quickly you don't need to turn to them
[1:05:22] luke 6
[1:05:23] 35 but love you your enemies and do good
[1:05:26] and
[1:05:26] land hoping for nothing again and your
[1:05:29] reward shall be great and you shall be
[1:05:30] the children of the highest
[1:05:32] for he is kind into the thankful
[1:05:34] unthankful
[1:05:35] and to the evil john 13 34 a new
[1:05:39] commandment i give
[1:05:40] unto you that you love one another as i
[1:05:43] have loved you
[1:05:44] that you love one another
[1:05:48] i i so often think of the scripture in
[1:05:50] ephesians 5
[1:05:52] husbands love your wives even as christ
[1:05:54] loved the church
[1:05:57] amen to that this is saying the same
[1:06:00] thing to each other
[1:06:02] we're to love one another as christ
[1:06:05] loved the church my how did he love us
[1:06:10] the very last breath
[1:06:13] he breathed was loving us and he rose
[1:06:17] again
[1:06:17] loving us he lived
[1:06:21] loving god and loving us and giving us
[1:06:24] all
[1:06:25] that's the kind of love that we're
[1:06:27] supposed to have for each other
[1:06:30] in the token brother branham says oh
[1:06:32] take this solemnly we should love one
[1:06:34] another oh my we should be so
[1:06:36] in love
[1:06:39] amen oh yeah that's awesome don't never
[1:06:42] speak evil against one another oh
[1:06:48] there's a lot that goes into that small
[1:06:50] phrase
[1:06:51] don't never speak evil against one
[1:06:54] another
[1:06:55] i'll let you think about it if somebody
[1:06:59] makes a mistake
[1:07:00] pray for him right quick
[1:07:03] we are together in this
[1:07:06] with god we are brothers and sisters
[1:07:10] that is a extremely packed
[1:07:13] quote and i'm going to read it again
[1:07:16] because it's awesome
[1:07:18] oh take this solemnly we should love one
[1:07:20] another oh my we should be so in love
[1:07:23] don't never speak evil against one
[1:07:25] another if somebody makes a mistake
[1:07:28] pray for him right quick we're together
[1:07:32] in this with god we're brothers and
[1:07:34] sisters
[1:07:36] i love that in expectations brother
[1:07:39] branham says
[1:07:40] simeon the great this great old saint of
[1:07:42] god he was a man of great reputation
[1:07:44] oh today they happen to say but wait a
[1:07:46] minute sir i'm a businessman i'm a
[1:07:47] doctor i'm a professor
[1:07:49] you're no better than anybody else
[1:07:52] and whenever you think you're better
[1:07:53] than somebody else then you're nothing
[1:07:55] that you ought to be
[1:07:58] the scripture says see when you get to a
[1:08:00] place you got to you how can you have
[1:08:02] faith
[1:08:03] when you're expecting honor one from
[1:08:05] another see
[1:08:06] you must prefer one another always
[1:08:09] that's
[1:08:10] the life of christ to prefer your
[1:08:11] brother sister
[1:08:13] and if they're wrong
[1:08:17] what is he gonna say next and if
[1:08:20] they're wrong
[1:08:24] that's all right you'll never make them
[1:08:28] any better by kicking them around
[1:08:31] put an arm around them pick them up i
[1:08:33] like this old time religion
[1:08:35] i'll tell you what it'll do it'll make a
[1:08:38] tuxedo
[1:08:39] suit set by a pair of overalls and put
[1:08:42] her
[1:08:42] arm around one another and call each
[1:08:44] other brother that's right
[1:08:46] it'll make a calico dress and a silk one
[1:08:48] call one another sister it sure will
[1:08:50] it's gun barrel straight
[1:08:52] and sky blue and it's it'll certainly
[1:08:55] do it i love that he put that statement
[1:08:58] it's gun barrel straight and sky blue
[1:09:01] right along with speaking against sin
[1:09:07] right along with love and you're no
[1:09:10] better than anybody else
[1:09:13] you're all the same whether you've got a
[1:09:14] tuxedo on you're rich in other words
[1:09:16] whether you're rich
[1:09:18] or whether you're poor that shouldn't
[1:09:19] change anything
[1:09:22] that shouldn't change our attitude that
[1:09:23] shouldn't change of our view of ourself
[1:09:25] that shouldn't change the view of other
[1:09:27] people
[1:09:31] i'm just going to read through first
[1:09:33] corinthians
[1:09:34] 13 4
[1:09:38] 4 through 7 and i'm going to read it in
[1:09:42] the
[1:09:42] in the esv just quickly go through it
[1:09:45] because you get a picture we
[1:09:48] we hear a lot love is corrective
[1:09:51] it is corrective amen but that's not all
[1:09:55] it is
[1:09:57] there's more right love is corrective
[1:10:00] god loves us and when we're wrong he
[1:10:02] corrects us
[1:10:05] and if we love one another we'll we'll
[1:10:07] in love
[1:10:10] not anger in love
[1:10:13] correct each other and when you correct
[1:10:16] each other
[1:10:16] you'll feel respected honored and loved
[1:10:21] not belittled and kicked in the dirt
[1:10:24] love is patient and kind love does not
[1:10:26] envy or boast
[1:10:28] it is not arrogant or rude it does not
[1:10:32] insist on its own way it is not
[1:10:35] irritable or
[1:10:36] resentful it does not rejoice at
[1:10:38] wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth
[1:10:41] love bears all things believes all
[1:10:43] things hopes all things
[1:10:45] endures all things
[1:10:49] amen
[1:10:52] second corinthians 12 15.
[1:11:02] and i will very gladly spend and be
[1:11:04] spent for you
[1:11:06] though the more abundantly i love you
[1:11:10] the less i be loved
[1:11:14] think about that for a second i mean
[1:11:15] it's easy to read these
[1:11:18] verses and and just go to the next one
[1:11:21] but look at what is being said i will
[1:11:25] spend in other words i'm going to take
[1:11:27] my resources
[1:11:30] and spend them for who
[1:11:33] believers the corinthians
[1:11:36] and again remember that the corinthians
[1:11:38] were a mess
[1:11:40] they were a mess but didn't change
[1:11:43] paul's attitude towards them
[1:11:45] it didn't change the way he felt about
[1:11:47] them
[1:11:48] i will spend and i will spend myself
[1:11:52] for you even though your love goes this
[1:11:56] way
[1:11:57] you decide we don't like paul i never
[1:11:59] really liked his preaching his letters
[1:12:01] are
[1:12:02] frustrating us and upsetting us says
[1:12:06] it doesn't matter i love i'm going to
[1:12:08] love you
[1:12:09] even more galatians 5
[1:12:13] 13-15
[1:12:18] for brethren you have been called unto
[1:12:20] liberty
[1:12:21] only use not liberty for an occasion to
[1:12:24] the flesh
[1:12:26] but by love serve one another for all
[1:12:29] the law is fulfilled in one word even
[1:12:32] this
[1:12:33] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:12:36] but if you de bite and devour one
[1:12:40] another
[1:12:41] take heed that you be not consumed
[1:12:45] one another by love
[1:12:48] serve one another how do we how do we
[1:12:51] express
[1:12:52] our love for one another again it's not
[1:12:54] just a
[1:12:55] feeling it's not just an emotion we sit
[1:12:57] in church i sure love these people as we
[1:12:59] clap together and sing to sing together
[1:13:02] that's that's fine
[1:13:03] it's good to feel that but that's not
[1:13:05] really what love is talking about it's
[1:13:07] talking about
[1:13:08] serving it's talking about
[1:13:12] spending yourself it's about expending
[1:13:15] your energy your money your time
[1:13:18] on other people
[1:13:21] and that means your family too
[1:13:25] not just outside of your family on your
[1:13:27] family too
[1:13:28] giving yourself as a sacrifice
[1:13:32] for other people
[1:13:35] for we want to fulfill the law how do we
[1:13:38] fulfill the law
[1:13:40] by having that love for other people
[1:13:43] love
[1:13:44] your neighbor as yourself it's pretty
[1:13:47] simple right
[1:13:49] we learn that from the time we're little
[1:13:50] babies in the jewish
[1:13:52] in the jewish faith they learn the shema
[1:13:56] and with the shema is hero israel the
[1:13:58] lord our god the lord is one
[1:14:00] shall love the lord your god with all
[1:14:01] your heart with all your soul with all
[1:14:03] your mind with all your strength
[1:14:05] and you shall love your neighbor as
[1:14:07] yourself they repeat this from the time
[1:14:09] there
[1:14:10] can even just speak right it's so simple
[1:14:13] and yet
[1:14:14] what is the thing that the lord through
[1:14:17] this
[1:14:18] beautiful message the opening of the
[1:14:20] word
[1:14:21] the great revelations that have come
[1:14:23] forth what is god
[1:14:24] giving us that for
[1:14:28] to do in us to bring us to that simple
[1:14:31] thing
[1:14:33] perfect love loving one another
[1:14:37] loving our enemies from our
[1:14:41] heart not because we have to but because
[1:14:45] we want to because god has placed it
[1:14:47] within us
[1:14:48] and it just is our it's our reaction
[1:14:51] it's our supernatural i was going to say
[1:14:52] natural reaction
[1:14:54] but it's our supernatural reaction to
[1:14:56] whatever
[1:14:57] comes in front of us so i think this is
[1:14:59] where jason has come it's
[1:15:01] this is a great place for me to stop
[1:15:04] so i'm going to hand it right i'm going
[1:15:05] to pray and hand it right over to you
[1:15:08] heavenly father we thank you so much for
[1:15:10] your word
[1:15:11] lord we pray you would allow this this
[1:15:15] life which is in the word to come into
[1:15:18] us
[1:15:19] lord i believe it's there within us by
[1:15:22] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:15:25] but we need to increase and abound
[1:15:28] in this love towards one another
[1:15:32] help help us to get ourselves out of the
[1:15:33] way help me to get myself
[1:15:35] out of the way and let you
[1:15:38] flow through me to others we just want

[1:17:48] wife
[1:17:49] and even with the glories of heaven and
[1:17:51] view and my
[1:17:53] knowing that in all likelihood my hand
[1:17:55] was on the door
[1:17:57] that would have crossed me to the other
[1:17:58] side but uh
[1:18:00] and you know you've heard me say as much
[1:18:03] as i'm looking forward to heaven
[1:18:06] i mean i don't want to take a shortcut i

[1:18:20] you're going in the rapture and there's
[1:18:21] nothing you can do about it

[1:18:31] i want to live my life in sincerity and
[1:18:33] serving

[1:18:39] you that quick update everything is
[1:18:41] every day i'm progressing feeling better
[1:18:44] and better and better
[1:18:46] and so um so i
[1:18:49] there's nowhere to start but start from
[1:18:50] the beginning and if you'll give me
[1:18:52] about 20-25 minutes
[1:18:54] just like to testify to the glory of god
[1:18:57] amen so i guess now it would have been
[1:19:03] not the past monday but the monday
[1:19:05] previous to that
[1:19:08] i had um just come off of a 30-day
[1:19:11] rather radical diet to drop some pounds
[1:19:14] amen and i packed them on i gained the
[1:19:17] whole
[1:19:17] entire cove at 19 pounds and and
[1:19:20] plus some additional ones and so uh
[1:19:23] so and then you know i i'd kind of been
[1:19:26] a little bit sequestered caring for my
[1:19:28] darling and
[1:19:29] so she's good now and the lord had me
[1:19:31] back i was losing weight
[1:19:33] and uh and so all was well so monday i
[1:19:37] decided to get back
[1:19:38] out on that monday um uh i guess
[1:19:41] be almost nearly a fortnight ago um
[1:19:45] but we as i went back started back with
[1:19:48] my cardio walking in the mornings
[1:19:52] it all began when i noticed a strange
[1:19:55] um it felt like indigestion
[1:19:58] it didn't feel like pain and
[1:20:01] it felt like i had you've been standing
[1:20:03] near me uh i would have said hey anthony
[1:20:05] he got a toms on you i would have said
[1:20:07] something like that
[1:20:08] and so i noticed and i walked pretty
[1:20:10] briskly i walked fast naturally
[1:20:13] second fastest walker that i know the
[1:20:15] only one faster than me is brother
[1:20:16] eugene
[1:20:17] brown and he i have to almost skip and
[1:20:19] hop to keep up with him
[1:20:20] it's those long legs i think but uh
[1:20:24] but but i walk fast normally and
[1:20:27] and so i my friends used to always you
[1:20:29] know we'd be
[1:20:30] teenagers going to the mall and i'd just
[1:20:32] be walking because i you know that for
[1:20:33] me why are we going to the mall okay
[1:20:34] let's go
[1:20:35] shopping let's go walking around and my
[1:20:36] friends are always saying slow
[1:20:38] down man you're supposed to cruise i'm
[1:20:40] like why are we here i'm not here to
[1:20:42] cruise let's go walking
[1:20:44] so i always walk fast and so
[1:20:47] i noticed that that was starting to
[1:20:49] happen in my chest and it was going
[1:20:50] it wasn't going anywhere else wasn't
[1:20:52] going up or over
[1:20:54] it was just going through to my middle
[1:20:56] back and it was quite uncomfortable
[1:20:59] and so i naturally just slowed down just
[1:21:03] naturally because i thought i was
[1:21:04] thinking about that i realized i'd
[1:21:06] slowed down well
[1:21:07] when i slowed down it stopped and i went
[1:21:10] that's not a good sign so
[1:21:13] so tuesday i went back out there it was
[1:21:17] again
[1:21:18] and uh i slowed down and it was still
[1:21:21] there i slowed down a little more and it
[1:21:23] went away
[1:21:25] and i thought well that's not
[1:21:29] a good thing and wednesday
[1:21:32] i went out and i couldn't walk slow
[1:21:35] enough
[1:21:36] to not have it happen
[1:21:39] so um i you know i'm
[1:21:42] monday and tuesday and wednesday i'm you
[1:21:45] know
[1:21:47] you know writing a letter to my sons and
[1:21:49] saying hey
[1:21:50] you know i'm gonna stick a letter in my
[1:21:52] wall safe here's the combination and
[1:21:54] it says you know do not open unless the
[1:21:56] unthinkable happens and
[1:21:58] and and there you know my wife hears me
[1:22:00] talking to what are you doing i'm like
[1:22:01] well you know it's a prudent thing
[1:22:03] you know you want to i should i should
[1:22:05] have a living will and that's true
[1:22:06] that's still true
[1:22:07] i still need to do that nothing wrong
[1:22:09] with that and so
[1:22:11] so i still need to do that but you know
[1:22:14] i just told my boys i said hey
[1:22:16] on this paper is the keys to all my
[1:22:17] kingdoms it has all my passwords all my
[1:22:20] computer accounts all my
[1:22:22] all my uh cloud servers has everything
[1:22:25] um every all of my business here's the
[1:22:28] uh passwords to all of it
[1:22:30] and i put it in there it's still there
[1:22:32] and uh
[1:22:34] just in prudence probably leave it there
[1:22:36] because i'm
[1:22:37] i'm i got a lot of i'm i'm i'm that guy
[1:22:40] who
[1:22:40] backs up his backup to his backup and so
[1:22:44] i have
[1:22:44] so many cloud servers and they're all
[1:22:46] just backing up the uh one or two that i
[1:22:48] use mainly
[1:22:49] so you know in the event um that
[1:22:52] something would ever happen i mean it
[1:22:53] would be a nightmare
[1:22:55] for my family to try to decipher
[1:22:56] everything that you know i have going on
[1:23:00] so but i you know i
[1:23:03] and i know i know i'm guilty of
[1:23:06] under playing things and sometimes you
[1:23:09] know i'm
[1:23:10] i'm i'm i tend to be positive minded i
[1:23:12] get that from brother eddie thank
[1:23:14] the lord i don't really suffer
[1:23:16] depression if depression ever comes on
[1:23:18] me it lasts
[1:23:19] almost a whole day and goes away and
[1:23:21] then i'm fine because i just shake it
[1:23:23] off and move on and
[1:23:25] you know my life and times are in his
[1:23:27] hands anyway so
[1:23:28] i'm just never going to give the devil
[1:23:30] credit that he's anybody
[1:23:32] as far as i'm concerned he ain't nobody
[1:23:34] and i don't live by his mercy and he
[1:23:36] don't make decisions about my life
[1:23:38] my father makes all my decisions
[1:23:42] and uh i don't need a treaty with the
[1:23:44] devil i don't need to make a deal with
[1:23:46] him
[1:23:46] um you know i i'm just going to attack
[1:23:49] him because he's going to attack me
[1:23:50] anyway
[1:23:51] there's no need for you to back up in
[1:23:53] spirituality the devil's not going to
[1:23:54] give you a break
[1:23:56] you know don't go thinking i'll just
[1:23:57] i'll just relax spiritually i won't be
[1:24:00] so you know i'll just get a little
[1:24:01] carnal
[1:24:02] maybe i'll get a little relief i promise
[1:24:04] you that won't happen
[1:24:05] the devil will just keep piling it on
[1:24:07] piling it on until he has you completely
[1:24:10] you know under his feet and that's
[1:24:12] nowhere for a child of god to live
[1:24:15] amen so where eagles were meant to be
[1:24:17] soaring
[1:24:19] so um so wednesday
[1:24:23] um coming to church and i think you were
[1:24:26] preaching that night hey yeah you were
[1:24:27] in the back and so i walked in and sat
[1:24:29] down
[1:24:30] and this has been going on now for three
[1:24:32] days and
[1:24:33] um i'm taking you know i'm using my uh
[1:24:36] my watch to
[1:24:37] take an ecg it's it's really an
[1:24:39] effective tool but it's only one lead
[1:24:41] it's not like the 12 lead they can put
[1:24:43] on you uh
[1:24:44] although it is it does work really well
[1:24:46] and i'm sending that
[1:24:47] in and you know getting um you know
[1:24:51] people that are close to me or look a
[1:24:53] little concerned and
[1:24:54] and i and i and i i know that i'm
[1:24:57] feeling a little bit of nervousness
[1:24:59] of course i'm not gonna that's probably
[1:25:00] the last thing in the world sister
[1:25:02] debbie would need to hear
[1:25:03] so i'm keeping it firmer you say well
[1:25:05] you know you're being dishonest hey hold
[1:25:07] on
[1:25:08] i got brother branham said that when
[1:25:10] abraham
[1:25:11] when god told abraham take your son and
[1:25:14] go
[1:25:14] and sleep and brother branham says in
[1:25:17] its own tape
[1:25:18] of course he didn't tell sarah because
[1:25:20] she would have screamed
[1:25:23] okay so that that's not a a carte
[1:25:26] blanche to keep things from your
[1:25:28] wife and family brothers but but you
[1:25:30] know i was just trying to exercise a
[1:25:32] little wisdom
[1:25:33] and um and plus i was trying to be
[1:25:35] positive because that's how i defeat the
[1:25:37] devil
[1:25:38] friends i've been all over the world
[1:25:39] i've seen him defeated so many times
[1:25:41] i could stand up here and use up all my
[1:25:43] time just giving you testimony i've seen
[1:25:45] the blind eyes open i've seen epileptic
[1:25:47] demons cast off of people
[1:25:48] i've had those things happen all over
[1:25:50] the world i've seen
[1:25:52] people write while the preaching of the
[1:25:53] gospel be healed of incurable diseases
[1:25:56] testified to it after service
[1:25:58] you know i've seen people give their
[1:25:59] hearts to the lord teenagers filled with
[1:26:01] the holy ghost
[1:26:02] while peter yet spake these words the
[1:26:04] holy ghost fell on them
[1:26:07] so i've seen that happen i know what god
[1:26:10] is capable of i am not a man of fear i
[1:26:12] don't
[1:26:13] fear anything and so uh you know and i
[1:26:16] and i've just i just say it like this
[1:26:19] you can't
[1:26:20] make you can't you can't frighten a man
[1:26:23] who's not afraid to die
[1:26:26] period and so you know that's just how i
[1:26:28] look at it and
[1:26:30] i'd rather look at it like that i'd
[1:26:32] rather see the glass half full i'd
[1:26:33] rather try to find that silver lining
[1:26:35] around every dark cloud
[1:26:37] you know so uh i'm always looking for
[1:26:40] the positive always
[1:26:41] trying to figure out you know the lord's
[1:26:43] got this and so
[1:26:45] that's really what was going on i wasn't
[1:26:47] being careless
[1:26:49] i was just being me and it served me
[1:26:52] well and i don't plan to change that
[1:26:54] but but um facts were the facts and the
[1:26:58] facts
[1:26:59] were and i didn't know it at that time i
[1:27:01] had a problem
[1:27:03] and um i knew of course brother eddie
[1:27:05] had um had heart disease and uh he had
[1:27:08] had a triple bypass at 60
[1:27:10] mom 64. and
[1:27:13] um and he had to stay on statins and the
[1:27:16] rest of his
[1:27:17] his days and uh and uh and then his
[1:27:20] mother
[1:27:20] she died at 58. 50. wow
[1:27:24] his mother passed away at 50 suddenly
[1:27:27] so um i knew that there was that
[1:27:30] element of it and so uh and i've i've
[1:27:34] i'm not i'm not the best when it comes
[1:27:36] to eating right and
[1:27:37] getting good sleep and exercising i will
[1:27:40] admit that
[1:27:41] that's how i was then it's not how i am
[1:27:43] now
[1:27:44] and so so i so i i knew that was all in
[1:27:48] my mind so i i
[1:27:49] you know i i had said i thought well you
[1:27:52] know here's a good idea
[1:27:53] so i thought you know i'll have doc
[1:27:55] meredith bring
[1:27:57] her blood pressure and stethoscope and
[1:28:00] als
[1:28:00] and i'd actually tried to um figure out
[1:28:03] how to
[1:28:04] we could meet sooner but we just decided
[1:28:06] okay wednesday night at church
[1:28:08] so she's all set i'm all set you know
[1:28:10] just i'm just taking precautions she's
[1:28:12] going to come back and and check vpn
[1:28:15] and heart rate and listen and and i can
[1:28:17] do an ecg here and there's a lot of
[1:28:19] different things
[1:28:20] uh well so i walk in because i'm
[1:28:24] this is this is going to be the first
[1:28:25] two things that happened
[1:28:27] together that were incredible because
[1:28:30] what i have discovered friends
[1:28:32] is that what is evident now
[1:28:35] what i didn't know then is that demon
[1:28:38] forces were
[1:28:39] moving trying to eliminate me
[1:28:43] but in a realm i couldn't see angels
[1:28:45] were moving to interdict
[1:28:47] and at every movement the devil would
[1:28:49] try the angel would interdict
[1:28:51] and and here you're about to hear two of
[1:28:53] the first ones
[1:28:54] so when i came to church i'm sitting in
[1:28:57] the in the back office
[1:28:59] and just walked in and i just sit down
[1:29:00] and matt's sitting there preparing
[1:29:02] and i i just thought well you know um i
[1:29:05] have a lot of confidence in matt's
[1:29:07] prayer should just have him
[1:29:08] offer prayer for me so i said hey son
[1:29:10] you got a minute he said yeah sure dad
[1:29:12] and he backed away from his notes
[1:29:13] and i just began to tell him what
[1:29:15] happened
[1:29:16] i said you know you probably were
[1:29:18] wondering about the the
[1:29:20] letter i sent you and your brothers and
[1:29:22] i said so monday and then this happened
[1:29:23] tuesday and then this happened wednesday
[1:29:26] and and i and and i said it felt like
[1:29:28] indigestion and it feels like when i
[1:29:30] walk it's worse when i sit down it goes
[1:29:33] away
[1:29:34] and he he's he was like
[1:29:38] what he's like you're not gonna believe
[1:29:40] what happened to me today and i said
[1:29:42] what
[1:29:42] and he said he was in a conversation
[1:29:44] with the man who i know well
[1:29:46] and that man was standing there giving
[1:29:49] him
[1:29:50] those exact same words and now he's been
[1:29:53] i guess in and out of the hospital over
[1:29:55] some heart and stress and different
[1:29:57] things that are going on in very
[1:29:59] poor health and was literally almost he
[1:30:02] said you're
[1:30:03] almost using the exact verbiage the same
[1:30:05] words
[1:30:06] and he's like dad you got to go to the
[1:30:07] hospital right now right now you got to
[1:30:10] leave and go and i'm like oh
[1:30:13] i'm not doing that oh my goodness you
[1:30:16] know and
[1:30:17] what do they know anyway and so
[1:30:20] and so uh but that's just me trying to
[1:30:22] play it off i hate
[1:30:23] making a federal case out of things
[1:30:25] making a big deal it gets away with me a
[1:30:27] little bit
[1:30:28] i probably get that from sister mom back
[1:30:30] there i'm a private person and
[1:30:33] so so i um so he's like he's
[1:30:37] and so he gets up and walks out man
[1:30:39] little did i know
[1:30:40] he was going to get reinforcements next
[1:30:42] thing i know he unlocks jd
[1:30:44] in walks chris and they're both standing
[1:30:46] over me like thugs and i'm thinking
[1:30:48] okay what is about to happen here and so
[1:30:51] he just he relates everything to him
[1:30:54] and uh and so they had prayer for me
[1:30:57] standing right there and
[1:30:58] and and now so the fact that he had had
[1:31:02] he had
[1:31:03] that very day had had that conversation
[1:31:04] with that man is what made him feel so
[1:31:06] urgent
[1:31:07] even with me trying to play it off and
[1:31:09] he just wouldn't he wouldn't have it
[1:31:11] and so i i just kept making excuses now
[1:31:14] you know what have happened friends
[1:31:17] i was planning for doc meredith to come
[1:31:20] and check me out and that's what i would
[1:31:23] have done
[1:31:24] i can tell you right now i would have
[1:31:26] said hey don't worry
[1:31:28] but on the way i think to church
[1:31:31] sister meredith had sent me a text
[1:31:33] saying
[1:31:35] with no plausible ex reason it's never
[1:31:38] happened before brother john wouldn't do
[1:31:40] this
[1:31:41] but he literally took her equipment out
[1:31:43] of the car before they left for church
[1:31:46] and you've never done that brother john
[1:31:49] or certainly would know not to do
[1:31:50] something like that
[1:31:51] but yet had he done that and had she had
[1:31:55] that stuff
[1:31:56] i would just let her come back and you
[1:31:57] know what she would have found the same
[1:31:59] thing that the er found when i went
[1:32:02] my heart was fine it sounded good
[1:32:04] everything was working good
[1:32:06] um while i was in the hospital over
[1:32:08] those
[1:32:09] three days including the the er that
[1:32:12] night
[1:32:13] um they they probably did a 12-lead ekg
[1:32:16] on me
[1:32:17] probably 20 times they'd come in every
[1:32:18] four hours all through the day and night
[1:32:21] taking they test my blood i went i went
[1:32:23] on because
[1:32:24] but you see because now watch how this
[1:32:26] chain of events works
[1:32:27] so matt has that conversation now he's
[1:32:31] concerned
[1:32:32] now i can't get out of it because she
[1:32:34] don't have her stuff so okay
[1:32:35] i'll go so chris you know and chris
[1:32:39] he wasn't going to have it matt wasn't
[1:32:40] going to have it brother jason was
[1:32:42] standing there they were praying for me
[1:32:44] and uh so chris took me uh popped me in
[1:32:47] his jeep we went up there while y'all
[1:32:48] were in service here
[1:32:50] and uh sure enough you know i had i'd
[1:32:53] done that one
[1:32:54] other time and you know they said they
[1:32:57] told me the same thing well you know we
[1:32:59] did your blood there's no enzymes
[1:33:01] there's nothing if you'd had a heart
[1:33:02] event it would be showing
[1:33:04] or you seem to be fine you have the
[1:33:05] heart of an athlete i've heard that many
[1:33:07] times
[1:33:08] i do have a strong a very strong
[1:33:10] ejection fraction in my heart very
[1:33:12] strong heart
[1:33:14] and so even at the emergency room that's
[1:33:16] what they're telling me
[1:33:18] and uh and so i'm saying well okay okay
[1:33:21] well praise the lord i guess i'm
[1:33:22] i'm okay and uh and i said well i'll
[1:33:25] i'll be
[1:33:26] y'all gonna get me checked out he goes
[1:33:27] well we'd actually like to keep you
[1:33:29] overnight for observation i was like
[1:33:32] i'm not doing that i said get get the
[1:33:34] papers ready i said i'm out of here i
[1:33:36] said if you've checked me out and i'm
[1:33:38] fine there's no reason
[1:33:40] uh to stay and so um
[1:33:43] the doctor was kind of um you know and
[1:33:47] it was so amazing i was texting brother
[1:33:49] andrews i'm going to the hospital hey
[1:33:50] doc
[1:33:51] you're working i'm coming up that way
[1:33:52] and he wasn't responding and i and i'm
[1:33:54] just texting him bombing him where are
[1:33:55] you at where you at
[1:33:56] and chris said daddy's on the piano
[1:34:00] he's playing piano he's just on the
[1:34:01] stage with him like oh okay never mind
[1:34:06] and so uh so but you know
[1:34:09] you know however that would have went
[1:34:10] but it turns out i had a different
[1:34:12] care provider and so
[1:34:16] uh i and so they told me they come in
[1:34:18] there and they said okay we're gonna let
[1:34:20] you go
[1:34:20] we know we can't stop you but
[1:34:23] understand that you're going home under
[1:34:25] us extremely heightened alert if you
[1:34:29] have anything no matter
[1:34:32] how mild if that comes back you've got
[1:34:35] to promise you'll come straight back

[1:34:43] to get in my truck i start feeling it
[1:34:46] and i get in and as soon as i sit in the
[1:34:48] truck it goes away

[1:36:36] minutes if you could be here in three
[1:36:37] minutes i said
[1:36:38] i'll be out the door in five minutes and
[1:36:40] i'll be there
[1:36:41] you understand friends god little things
[1:36:44] moving behind the scenes
[1:36:47] and so you know i got into the doctor
[1:36:49] and you know that guy's funny man i i
[1:36:52] like him a lot and
[1:36:54] and um and so uh they
[1:36:57] i i don't i could be completely wrong i
[1:36:59] don't have a clue if he's on the
[1:37:00] spectrum i think he's high functioning
[1:37:02] autistic myself
[1:37:04] because he's so odd and the nurses all
[1:37:06] said oh he's kind of mean and rude
[1:37:08] and as soon as i start talking to him i
[1:37:11] realize he's not mean and rude
[1:37:13] he's just he he and i thought to myself
[1:37:16] i've seen this before
[1:37:18] and he has he has an oddity about him
[1:37:20] because he's on the
[1:37:22] if if so be that he's on that upper end
[1:37:24] of the spectrum which i have no i
[1:37:26] no idea if that's true but he was he was
[1:37:29] uh
[1:37:29] he's a brilliant man he reminded me of
[1:37:31] mike gonzalez
[1:37:35] brother michael and brother michael's a
[1:37:37] different kind of a dude and you have to
[1:37:38] understand brother mike when you're
[1:37:40] talking to him
[1:37:41] brilliant guy but uh you know brother
[1:37:43] michael has a a very high functioning
[1:37:46] level on the spectrum that's why he's so
[1:37:47] good at his job
[1:37:49] and so uh and i thought well i know i
[1:37:52] know i've seen this before
[1:37:53] and so then i started realizing how to
[1:37:55] deal with him and then
[1:37:57] you know it it started going good from
[1:37:59] right there
[1:38:00] and so i um but i'm still trying to play
[1:38:03] it off
[1:38:04] and you know he's listening to my
[1:38:07] symptoms and he's listening to me
[1:38:08] describe everything and he's like
[1:38:11] you're scaring me to death he said
[1:38:15] you need to go back to the hospital
[1:38:17] right now
[1:38:19] and i was like oh you know i don't know
[1:38:22] about that he goes he said i
[1:38:23] i don't even want to finish this visit
[1:38:26] he said
[1:38:27] you know you're telling me he said
[1:38:29] you're giving me the worst thing a
[1:38:31] cardiologist can hear
[1:38:32] you have pain when you walk in your
[1:38:34] chest and when you stop
[1:38:36] it stops and i said yeah he goes
[1:38:39] i said well but i only have a little bit
[1:38:42] he said well i don't have any
[1:38:45] and he looked at his assistant he said
[1:38:46] do you have any and it says no and he
[1:38:48] looked at matt
[1:38:48] do you have any man's like nope and so
[1:38:52] so i said he said you got i'm going to
[1:38:55] call
[1:38:56] you go right you're going to be admitted
[1:38:57] i'm going to call ahead and then i'll be
[1:38:59] right behind you after i
[1:39:00] finish up so
[1:39:04] so i go out to the car and you know
[1:39:06] matt's right on my heel okay let's go
[1:39:08] okay dad
[1:39:09] and i'm like okay listen matt i'm gonna
[1:39:11] i'm gonna go home first i'm not prepared
[1:39:13] to go and his dad
[1:39:15] that's it i was gonna have to fight him
[1:39:17] he said you're
[1:39:18] not that's not gonna happen you're going
[1:39:21] i'll go to your house and get all your
[1:39:22] stuff
[1:39:23] you're going straight to hospital i said
[1:39:25] mom don't even know i need an overnight
[1:39:27] bag mom will get all that
[1:39:28] i'll get all your stuff and uh he said
[1:39:31] you
[1:39:31] leave here and go straight there and
[1:39:33] i'll take my truck and go to your house
[1:39:34] right away
[1:39:37] oh well here we go so i go to back out
[1:39:40] his truck he had parked when he met me
[1:39:42] there he parked around the back because
[1:39:43] we thought that's where we would go in
[1:39:45] so i gotta give him a quick lift around
[1:39:48] the building
[1:39:49] and and now i'm just trying to back up
[1:39:51] and i can't you know there's cars on
[1:39:53] both sides
[1:39:54] i'm at a way far remote into the parking
[1:39:56] lot and so i'm carefully starting to
[1:39:58] back out i don't see anything in my rear
[1:39:59] camera
[1:40:00] i don't see anything doing this right as
[1:40:02] i back out like this
[1:40:04] to go that way as soon as i back out oh
[1:40:07] i'm sorry there's a car and and some guy
[1:40:11] and he's just come to a stop and he
[1:40:13] doesn't look happy
[1:40:14] and people are so uh you know uptight
[1:40:17] these days
[1:40:19] my goodness the guy was already red in
[1:40:21] the face and
[1:40:22] older man than me and and uh
[1:40:25] you know i mean i just looked so i you
[1:40:28] know how you you know how sometimes
[1:40:30] where it's
[1:40:31] more makes more sense rather than do the
[1:40:34] american thing to go around the right
[1:40:36] it's more british and better just to go
[1:40:38] left and let him go that way because
[1:40:39] you're already kind of
[1:40:40] jacked up in that angle a little bit and
[1:40:43] so i just said oh
[1:40:44] i waved i'm sorry and i went to go left
[1:40:46] so he could slip around me
[1:40:47] and he man he's looking through his
[1:40:50] windshield at me and he's like one
[1:40:55] and i and i just thought what in the
[1:40:58] world and you know i i'm
[1:41:01] real laid back and easy going and
[1:41:05] and uh and and that in it and it was
[1:41:07] something like that
[1:41:08] wouldn't have bothered me until it
[1:41:10] occurred to me
[1:41:12] goodness gracious he's doing that on
[1:41:15] purpose
[1:41:16] this guy is like on purpose won't move
[1:41:20] and it's trying to block me well
[1:41:23] that don't work for brother jason and so
[1:41:26] the next thing you know i'm all up in
[1:41:28] the air and he's up in the air and
[1:41:29] matt's jumping out of the truck and
[1:41:31] trying to talk to him you know get out
[1:41:33] of the way and you know we got to go to
[1:41:34] the hospital and some other different
[1:41:35] things but
[1:41:37] it whatever got said he finally
[1:41:40] reluctantly moved out of my way
[1:41:43] and and and matt you know jump back in
[1:41:45] he goes you see that
[1:41:46] you're definitely going to the hospital
[1:41:47] now you're definitely
[1:41:50] going right now and so um so i did
[1:41:55] and um you know they started their
[1:41:58] battery of tests and they
[1:41:59] my goodness i've never been stuck poke
[1:42:02] stabbed
[1:42:02] bled tested scanned in
[1:42:06] in my life and i was giving you a little
[1:42:08] bit of updates and
[1:42:09] every test was coming back right as rain
[1:42:13] all my ekgs were coming back normal all
[1:42:15] my blood they were taking blood every
[1:42:16] four hours all coming back normal
[1:42:19] um had a little high a little bit of the
[1:42:22] i guess there's two kinds of cholesterol
[1:42:23] and my bad one was a little high
[1:42:25] and so um other than that and blood
[1:42:29] pressure was a little moderate my blood
[1:42:30] pressure been that way for 30 years
[1:42:32] always on the
[1:42:33] what they call a moderate high or
[1:42:36] something like that
[1:42:37] not never life-threatening but you know
[1:42:40] my
[1:42:40] brother eddie always used to tell me i
[1:42:42] should get that treated i never did
[1:42:45] and uh and then you know they did they
[1:42:47] were doing every kind of scan they
[1:42:48] nuclear scans and and they took me down
[1:42:51] to nuclear medicine and
[1:42:53] they did a uh a calcium scan and even
[1:42:55] the even the cardiologist came back and
[1:42:58] he stood in my room and he said you know
[1:43:00] he said i'm really shocked he said um
[1:43:03] he said i really expected with your
[1:43:05] blood pressure and you haven't treated
[1:43:07] it for 30 years
[1:43:08] he said i expected your heart and aryan
[1:43:11] valves i guess whatever that works
[1:43:13] to have a lot of calcium buildup and he
[1:43:15] said you really didn't have any
[1:43:18] he said i was stunned by that he said i
[1:43:20] did see one small area
[1:43:22] but he said it looks very very slight
[1:43:24] i'm not really worried about it
[1:43:26] and i was sitting there thinking i
[1:43:28] thought well you know
[1:43:29] brother matt brother chris and brother
[1:43:32] jason and the whole church
[1:43:34] you know i knew was praying for me so i
[1:43:37] just
[1:43:37] i just say glory be to god because it
[1:43:39] even surprised him
[1:43:42] and so they were doing every other kind
[1:43:44] of test and
[1:43:45] everything was coming up good and uh
[1:43:48] so on the last day they decided to do
[1:43:51] the
[1:43:52] uh nuclear stress test and they had
[1:43:55] actually did some of the nuclear parts
[1:43:56] of it the night before
[1:43:58] to get that out of the way and the next
[1:43:59] day that i guess i was going to do the
[1:44:01] treadmill part
[1:44:02] hooked up and then they combine oh i'm
[1:44:04] not sure how it works i guess they
[1:44:05] combine all the data
[1:44:07] but it's the most effective one i guess
[1:44:09] better than just
[1:44:10] you know doing the regular stress test
[1:44:12] so i was getting the best of care and
[1:44:14] they weren't taking any shortcuts
[1:44:17] but we were encouraged my wife my family
[1:44:20] the church i was telling you hey all the
[1:44:21] tests are coming back good thank you for
[1:44:23] your prayers
[1:44:24] and while i was on the machine
[1:44:28] and um they had they had it speed
[1:44:31] sped it up pretty good and i was doing
[1:44:33] just fine
[1:44:35] i'd had a lot of anxiety over doing it
[1:44:37] until i got going i thought this is
[1:44:38] nothing this is easy
[1:44:40] and this is almost not much faster than
[1:44:42] i walk because i
[1:44:43] power walk a lot and so but
[1:44:46] then i started feeling it and i
[1:44:50] said to the technician and and you know
[1:44:52] what the
[1:44:53] i didn't realize i saw the technician
[1:44:55] trying to look over his shoulders he
[1:44:56] said
[1:44:56] wow do what do what do we owe this great
[1:44:59] privilege because the cardiologist had
[1:45:01] actually come down
[1:45:03] to to witness it he doesn't usually do
[1:45:05] that they were surprised he was in there
[1:45:07] he said i just wanted to see how mr
[1:45:08] watkins would do
[1:45:10] so he's standing behind me she's to here
[1:45:11] and there's another technician back over
[1:45:13] here
[1:45:14] and i said hey you know i'm starting to
[1:45:15] feel that a little bit and he spoke up
[1:45:17] behind me he said you feel it right now
[1:45:19] and i said yeah right this minute and he
[1:45:21] was looking at the at the scans as it
[1:45:23] was because it does it live
[1:45:26] and uh he said could you speed up and i
[1:45:29] said
[1:45:30] sure yeah go for it and you know then
[1:45:32] they really cranked it up and then i
[1:45:34] went right along and he said you feel it
[1:45:35] and i said yeah definitely i feel a lot
[1:45:37] right now
[1:45:38] he goes okay i've seen enough and they
[1:45:40] stopped he said
[1:45:41] i'll take all this data back to my
[1:45:43] office and
[1:45:44] i'll make a decision this afternoon what
[1:45:47] to do
[1:45:48] and when he went back he looked at
[1:45:50] everything looked at all the studies
[1:45:53] and everything from the night i'd been
[1:45:55] into the er
[1:45:56] and he he felt good about it all
[1:46:00] but just in an abundance of caution he
[1:46:03] called me and talked to me on the phone
[1:46:05] and in an abundance of caution he said
[1:46:07] i'm going to do that he said
[1:46:09] let's just do one last thing just so we
[1:46:11] can be
[1:46:12] sure when he said that i was glad
[1:46:14] because i thought i want to be sure
[1:46:16] you know i would like to know uh and if
[1:46:19] that's not what it is then what is it
[1:46:21] and so and when they when
[1:46:24] you know they have me and you they don't
[1:46:25] actually put you to sleep and
[1:46:27] i was so glad he's the only cardiologist
[1:46:29] that goes through here
[1:46:31] rather than through a groin and up like
[1:46:32] he goes up through here and over and
[1:46:34] down in
[1:46:35] and as soon as he did he i i could
[1:46:38] kind of see him and there was a screen
[1:46:40] and another screen but i could see him
[1:46:42] and he he's right there and he's looking
[1:46:44] and he goes mr watkins you have
[1:46:46] you have a blockage wow he said a big
[1:46:48] blockage he said 95
[1:46:51] and then he revised it to 99
[1:46:54] and um and then i had two others which
[1:46:57] were not consequential they didn't even
[1:46:59] bother with them at all uh diet and
[1:47:02] exercise could handle them
[1:47:04] um but and for my age it wouldn't even
[1:47:06] be that uncommon where they
[1:47:08] were but that one was my main artery
[1:47:11] and um and they call it the widow maker
[1:47:14] artery
[1:47:15] and i would through that main artery my
[1:47:17] heart was getting about one percent of
[1:47:19] its
[1:47:20] needed blood and that's why when i would
[1:47:22] walk fast it was starving my heart was
[1:47:24] starving for for oxygen and blood
[1:47:26] and i was literally friends probably
[1:47:29] within hours or days of passing away
[1:47:32] suddenly to the cataclysmic shock of my
[1:47:35] family
[1:47:36] to the shock of you as my church as a
[1:47:38] church
[1:47:39] and um you know but i just say that
[1:47:44] that the lord who spared my life must
[1:47:47] have
[1:47:47] more for me to do and can i say it like
[1:47:50] this the lord must have more for us to
[1:47:52] do
[1:47:54] how about it how many will join that
[1:47:56] with me and say brother jason the lord
[1:47:58] must have more for us to do
[1:48:00] amen and so you know i i said
[1:48:04] a few comments you know i think
[1:48:05] wednesday about you know i realize that
[1:48:08] i'm trying to concentrate on quality
[1:48:09] over quantity it's not works for the
[1:48:11] sake of works
[1:48:13] remember my testimony to you many times
[1:48:16] and from years ago
[1:48:17] when i'm asking the lord to let me do
[1:48:19] more for him remember that
[1:48:20] i said lord i just want to do more i
[1:48:22] just want to do more for you
[1:48:24] and the lord spoke to me in one of the
[1:48:25] clearest ways i've ever had happen and
[1:48:28] the lord said i don't need you to do
[1:48:30] more
[1:48:31] i need you to be more you do the be and
[1:48:34] i'll do the doing
[1:48:36] is what he said and and so now you can
[1:48:39] well imagine that with a deeper
[1:48:41] sincerity
[1:48:42] uh than ever before to get us all home

[2:33:06] [Music]
[2:33:16] well i am here very unexpectedly
[2:33:24] um okay
[2:33:27] well so a very long time ago
[2:33:31] 20 some years ago the lord put promise
[2:33:33] above my heart
[2:33:36] and i was that woman that went to the
[2:33:39] lord
[2:33:40] and had to touch the hem of his garment
[2:33:45] for a special need in my life
[2:33:48] my marriage had been destroyed
[2:33:54] and he promised to restore it
[2:34:00] so i've just had
[2:34:03] an experience with the lord where i had
[2:34:05] the cancer last year
[2:34:07] and the lord used ministry to
[2:34:11] direct me and give me special things
[2:34:14] that
[2:34:14] helped me so much
[2:34:18] and just gave me direction and um
[2:34:21] it was like one service after another
[2:34:23] lord put on my heart and i didn't even
[2:34:25] know these services
[2:34:26] existed but the lord directed them to me
[2:34:30] on youtube and they would pop up and it
[2:34:32] would be this ministry and that ministry
[2:34:35] it was just what i needed and the first
[2:34:38] one
[2:34:39] started with one here in october
[2:34:42] that our brother jason demars preached
[2:34:47] he didn't know it but the lord spoke to
[2:34:49] me in that service
[2:34:52] telling me that i was going to go
[2:34:54] through something but that i was going
[2:34:55] to be okay
[2:34:56] so it put a faith in me that there was
[2:34:58] just no fear
[2:34:59] at all from the from the moment i found
[2:35:01] out that i had melanoma
[2:35:05] and as you all know that the lord just
[2:35:07] brought me through that amazingly
[2:35:09] um and i'm 100 um
[2:35:13] the lord's been doing that to me with
[2:35:15] this restoration of my marriage
[2:35:17] um there's been a lot of events that's
[2:35:19] been taking place that
[2:35:22] just it's just been amazing
[2:35:25] um but i stand here today
[2:35:28] knowing that it doesn't matter what i
[2:35:30] see with my eyes
[2:35:33] it's just knowing what i know in my
[2:35:34] heart the lord has promised
[2:35:37] so i'm not standing here telling you
[2:35:39] this because everything looks good and
[2:35:41] everything looks peachy
[2:35:42] i'm standing here i was standing back
[2:35:45] there and
[2:35:46] because i'm not supposed to be in a
[2:35:47] group of fifty so i'm very social
[2:35:48] distance so
[2:35:49] i'm i'm good um but um
[2:35:56] uh brother matt preached the other night
[2:35:58] and um
[2:36:00] and he was at the end of the service um
[2:36:02] he was just going into you know the holy
[2:36:05] spirit going out after your family and
[2:36:08] then of course that's just one of the
[2:36:11] things that was said
[2:36:12] um but it's just touching my heart right
[2:36:15] where god wants it touched
[2:36:17] because it's putting a deeper burden
[2:36:22] and then brother branham's message
[2:36:26] when i lived in tennessee before the
[2:36:28] lord brought me here
[2:36:29] for his specific purpose
[2:36:33] this particular service was one that god
[2:36:36] directed me to hear that i needed at the
[2:36:38] time and it was telling me
[2:36:40] there's a time and a season and when
[2:36:43] it's his season that's when it's going
[2:36:45] to come
[2:36:45] to pass and
[2:36:49] i'm two years down the road since the
[2:36:51] lord directed me to that
[2:36:53] menace to that to that sermon
[2:36:57] and that sermon came to me just the
[2:36:58] other day i was like oh my goodness
[2:37:01] the same is just on my heart all day and
[2:37:03] i was like oh god thank you
[2:37:06] and there's been some things that's
[2:37:08] progressed in
[2:37:10] his life that's you know just made me
[2:37:12] you know recognized that you know
[2:37:14] god does one thing and then he'll do
[2:37:16] another and he has to do it all in a
[2:37:18] certain order in order for it to all
[2:37:19] work out the way it wants to
[2:37:21] and
[2:37:24] i didn't have no intention of doing this
