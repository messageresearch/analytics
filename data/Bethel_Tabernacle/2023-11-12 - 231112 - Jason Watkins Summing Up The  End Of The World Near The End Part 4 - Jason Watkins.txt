shake hands with somebody give them a hearty greeting nicest thing you can say to somebody God bless you amen praise the Lord by happy Christians today am joy in your salvation you have a right to amen don't let the devil take that Joy from you amen God bless you we're going to invite you to um just a second have a seat amen I want to give um a little bit of an update extended testimony before I go to the word and it's what I'm saying today will likely have to be updated again because it's it's it's under active um it's it's kind of Galloping forward but um I've had a lot of questions uh both domestic and foreign from overseas Brothers asking me uh concerning the sharks swimming in the May building in Downtown Los Angeles amen uh This was um not something that brother Brandon prophesied and told on tape but it's a personal testimony of brother Billy Paul and testimony was that there he wouldn't be an old man before sharks would swim in and out of that building so that you know that and I and that has kind of went around because now that brother Billy has went on to be with the Lord and uh we have known for years that that prophecy was fulfilled in the early 1970s amen now In fairness to brother Billy I asked him about that and they he he didn't have a um an agreement or disagreement that that was the Fulfillment of it but he didn't really know he said you know and I said you know and I there's a quite a backstory to it but I I'll just I just kind of want to give a fresh testimony while it's being streamed on the internet today because I've been asked about it a number of times and brother Tim puit some time ago gave a little um little kind of a synopsis of it and uh so I want to give a little bit more detail today um there is somewhat of a backstory that I will need to tell you because I I sat down with brother Billy personally and asked him about this some years ago quite a number of years ago um probably more than a couple decades ago and we were talking about it and I asked him about that story of his dad saying to him Billy where are you standing I'm in front of the May building downtown Los Angeles you won't be an old man before shark swim so brother Billy said to me he said now there's a little bit of a you have to understand what's behind that and what had been behind that which actually ends up making it even more confirmed um is that when brother brandham began the Lord spoke to him concerning sister Florence shakarian you remember brother Deus sharan sister and that uh brother brandham saw in a vision that she was she was uh sick and not going to live and that the Lord was bringing her home there was nothing wrong as far as why the Lord did that it was just her time and the Lord was bringing his daughter home she has a wonderful brother brandham said a wonderful Christian sister and brother brandom at first thought that he you know you can hear him on tape he said I I knew she wasn't going to be he he said but I just couldn't tell Deus I he couldn't bring himself to do it but eventually brother brandham did let it be known thus sayith the Lord that she was not going to live she was going to die and that she would die at 4 a.m. in the morning 4:00 in the morning and she would go quietly and peacefully well sometime after that brother Billy began to relate how that they were in meetings and and and there began to be prophecy moving through that Pentecostal Gathering and concerning sister Florence sharan and they began to testify you know people falling and speaking in tongues uh you know to the effect of in brother Billy's words that was to the effect of you shall not die God hath heard your prayers and you shall live thus sayeth the Lord and that's not uncommon for that to happen you remember in the days of Jeremiah when Jeremiah prophesied concerning Israel going into captivity for 70 years and another Prophet who was a real Prophet see now bear in mind you you can be a real Prophet that doesn't necessarily make you a true Prophet yeah amen you can be a real one balum was a real one but he wasn't a true one and Hanah was a real one but he wasn't a true one because he prophesied contrary to the words of Jeremiah and said they'll only be there to you years when Jeremiah had said 70 years and Jeremiah didn't argue with him he just said amen so be it let the Lord perform your words but remember there was a prophet before us my Prophet matches him because that was the prophecy of Elijah concerning the king of Israel and and what would happen to them and so we know that Jeremiah compared his prophecy to Jeremiah compared Rema to logos yeah amen amen amen we're going to continue in that today amen so Jeremiah's Rema was compared to the logos which was the established word and that the logos now that the that Elijah had prophesied was now that anointing falling on Jeremiah and that word became Rema same word but now it's living in flesh again yeah and it's going forward so when they began to prophesy that sister Florence would not die the Lord had heard her prayer something to that effect um the meeting concluded and the next day as I remember brother Billy telling me they were walking down the street in Los Angeles down apparently I'm assuming it would be Broadway because that's where the May building is located and we find that South on South Broadway and we find that Billy told me that brother Billy told me that he was very upset in his spirit and he said you could never never hide that from Daddy you couldn't hide anything from him and as we're walking along he said I and just as a sidebar Perry green testified one time that um he had troubled about something and brother brandom called him and told him what he was troubled about and you know don't worry about it said said brother Perry don't worry if if if you if you you know if uh if there's anything wrong I'll call you brother Perry said imagine living under that for two years there's anything anything wrong I'll call you and so uh so he says you know Billy what's wrong brother Billy told me he tried to blow it off and say Oh Daddy nothing and he said Paul and he said no whenever he called me Paul he was serious he wasn't it wasn't dad anymore this was a different gear and he said Paul what's wrong and brother Billy knew he couldn't hide it and he said well Daddy in that meeting you know you you all those people were saying she's going to live and the Lord has heard her prayers and it's going to be great and the people were rejoicing and you just sit there you didn't say a word and and and brother brandham said to him said Paul I already told them what God told me there's no need to say it different no need to repeat it no just like when they come to Jesus and said okay now tell us plainly no more Parables no more messing around who are you just just say it there's not a new answer there no new revelation I'm the same one I already told you who I am and you didn't believe me you didn't believe John you didn't believe me you don't believe me now so so he said I he said Paul I already told them what the Lord said to me there's no need to debate and argue with them if that's what they believe now uh he he and he and he said and and he said Paul where are you and brother Billy knew this was a different kind of a moment and he at first he said I didn't know what Dad meant what do what do you mean where am I I'm on the street no Paul where are you and brother Billy confessed to me that he actually felt a little bit of frustration not irritation at all but but a little bit like I don't know what are you what are you asking I what do you mean where am I he's like and he said so I just I just went I'm standing in front of the May building in Downtown Los Angeles and brother brandham just said that you just for you Billy as a confirmation about what I said about sister Florence the same one that told me that sister Florence will pass away at 400 a.m. the same one who told me about sister Florence tells me to tell you now you won't be an old man before sharks will swim in and out of that door and he came out of it and they walked on and I said so brother Billy do you think and I asked the question everybody wanted to ask I said do you think that cuz by the time I'm talking to him he's already an old man and I said do you think it's possible that brother Brandon meant you would have crossed over hence you'd be in a young body and hence you wouldn't be an old man and brother Billy said to me he said brother Jason I I don't know the answer to that he said all I can do is tell you that at the time he told it to me I didn't take it that way that's not that's not what I took him to mean I took him to mean at that moment he said now if that that's how it turns out that's how it turns out but all I'm telling you is that's not how it struck me I didn't think that was his meaning at the time that I wouldn't be an old man before it would actually happen and so and then of course sister Florence did just a little while later wasn't very long after that all of those false prophecies proved false and brother bram's word proved true while he's in the meeting he got a note sister FL lawence has passed away and he sent the man back to say go call him back and ask them what time and they went and called sure enough for in the morning she slipped away and it was confirmed 100% so now we deal with this situation where what brother Billy is told by his dad in the name of the Lord it was no doubt about it it was told to him as Prophecy in the name of the Lord so we first found out and I I heard brother Ronald Dean speak testified that in the 1970s when he was young that his mom and dad brother Charlie who I knew and his mother who I knew very well knew them since a a child a te a young teenager I knew his parents and and knew of them and then got to meet them and they were wonderful Christian people brother Charlie was the pastor there in Christiansburg for years and he's went on to be with the Lord now and brother Ronald Dean testified that they were listening to the radio in the kitchen and they were listening to Paul Harvey news everybody half the world listened to Paul Harvey because he always had these little weird news stories you'd never hear in the mainstream and he had a way a you know Homespun way and people liked him I remember hearing him as a child there's actually repositories with some of his uh his his radio shows he is nationally syndicated and he started telling a story that brother Charlie brother and sister Spencer both witnessed that he told a story in the 70s about how that there had been flooding in the downtown area of Los Angeles and that sharks had been seen in the water in the May building yeah and they heard that listening to his radio broadcast they heard it with their own ears and they turned to each other then and said there's BR there's what brother Bram said to brother Billy and in the and in the 1970s Billy was not an old man see and so so then that that that we were in the fellowship hall probably some years ago maybe I would say seven or eight years ago and um um was that didn't he think brother George brother thought it about seven years ago we were talking yeah yeah that's right we were in the fellowship hall talking and uh you remember when Brother Gary Hall and sister Jan Hall were here and brother Gary was our lead guitarist sister Jan played rhythm guitar and we got talking about that and Gary said that his older sister Bonnie had worked in the May building yeah and we wondered out loud I wonder if she would have a recollection of that and he said well she worked there in the 70s I know that he said I could I could find out so I said Brother Gary do that so the next thing we know is that Brother Gary and sister Jan came back to report that he had talked to his sister and and he and and sister Jan were witnesses that she remembered it precisely and she remembered it specifically Brother Gary says and I have his recorded testimony that and I'm going to I'm going to post that but that the reason she remembered it so much is because he said I hate to say it but my sister cared about money she was you know she was she knew certain people in the Hollywood area she was kind of in those circles she was the second highest ranking officer they actually wanted her to be the manager of the May Company but their mandate in the 1970s prescribed that it had to be a man and so they made her the second ranking officer and and fi come to find out the reason she remembered it so vividly is because she didn't miss work because if she missed work she lost money and she remembered she said I went to work on a on on he said what year was it she said it was 1974 she remembered it crystal clear and brother Gary and sister Jan both witnessed this to me she remembered it vividly said yeah I I drove to work that day and that when I when I went to go into the underground parking lot to my parking space there were guards stopping everybody and they stopped me and said you can't go in because the whole lower part is all flooded the basement the parking everything is your car first of all your car will flood out it's deep and we have actually seen sharks swimming in the water and it turns out that that her testimony was that it had something to do she remembered that it had something to do with storm drain backup now their their drains their storm drains drained into the ocean and so because that there had been some for some reason she couldn't remember a backup that actually see water had rushed into the city through the drain through the what had been supposed to go that way and had flooded the area and water invaded the buildings in that area of Broadway and the May building was flooded and marine life from the ocean including sharks had been seen swimming in the water and she absolutely testified to it that it was 100% Tru she remembered it vividly in 1974 now um is that accurate Brother George how I'm relating that now there's there's another detail you should know brother George after was standing there hearing Brother Gary give us that testimony yesterday because I went back I wanted to get it from him fresh and and and we and when he gave us the testimony brother George actually went onto a government website weather.gov and he and and he found where the government weather website tracks I didn't know they did it they track these kinds of of flooding or any kind of thing to do in nature and they and he he he narrowed it down to Southern California and turns out brother George uncovered an entire PDF released by the government that dated all the way back into the 1800s didn't it brother George I think it started where they started tracking it and they literally had every kind of weather anomaly that had struck that area and as I'm scrolling down I'm looking and I knew brother George had sent it to me for a reason and I came down to 1974 I think there were three instances in 1974 and was it March in March 1974 they had severe heavy rains that had caused the storm drains to back up and water had had flowed in reverse and blew 200 lb manhole covers off in the streets as water rushed forward and so now we actually have a government website correlating Bonnie's testimony that it was in 1974 and that she was told sharks were in the water and Paul Harvey reported the story and Billy Paul says his daddy told him that in the 1960s I'm here to tell you something friends that prophecy was 100% fulfilled Amen in 1974 and Billy was not an old man so you know I I I'm I'm not needing to convince any of us as Believers but I just like being able to correlate and see these things and God has caused them who knew that the government kept that kind of detailed records that it act and now and then here's something else brother George that you didn't know so this morning I looked at the address of the May building on South Broadway and I look and I had formerly looked at the address of the azuza Revival did I preach it yet here about when I was telling you all I can't remember I know I've taught it somewhere where brother brandham constantly talked about you know I don't think this was his word cuz but it he talked about God is going to sink Hollywood you that it says and he he he emphasized that it cabbaged down on like Hollywood would be the epicenter he said God because it's all heaped up on the west coast we used to get our Fashions from Paris yeah I remember preaching here now and now we he said now they come to us because it's Hollywood and and he says God is going to sink Hollywood that's why he's going to do it because of the filth that has went around the world from Hollywood and it's heaped up to where again and that's the gospel going to go back to the Jews so in in in one type all right now so so I you remember I told you that I measured where the seventh Church age Revival started in ausa yeah and I've been on Aza Street and I went and I pinpointed it on maps Apple Maps and Google Maps and they both and you remember I told you that from where the Holy Ghost fell on isua Street to Hollywood was seven miles seven not six not eight seven well I tested where Broad Street where the May building was and it was actually over respectively it was just up and over but both of them to Hollywood are exactly seven miles amen right where a prophecy goes forward sharks swim right here and we all thought it was because of the California earthquake it wouldn't have anything to do with that but God is going to sink that and both that Prophecy of the May building and where the isus of Revival fell are exactly 7even miles to Hollywood I want to tell you something friends you can't make that stuff up that's not an accident God is in control of everything do you believe it amen I want to have that on on record so uh God bless you whoever will will see this you're welcome to share it with whomever let's stand back to our feet and I want to invite you to Revelation 21 and I'm I'm going to do better this Sunday than I did last Sunday I have to now that I've taken up a lot of my time with the testimony I just want to go a little further and I I've got I'll have at least two more parts to it so uh if you've missed any of the parts go back and get them today should be part four Revelation 219 and I'm going to try today to do my best in impression of brother Harold Becket and who just speaks in a nice evening doesn't really get excited and and and because I've paid stop [Laughter] laughing and so so I I I I've paid a price all week um with with a swelling feeling in my eye but I appreciate brother Luther's prayer this morning and uh you should know that I have claimed my complete deliverance of it and I not change that I'm absolutely going to be free of it completely absolutely and everything about my eye is going to go back to previous levels Lord amen amen praise the Lord Amen Brother John we're both going to confess our eyes back to perfect health your body will obey your confession sure will amen Revelation 21 and we'll catch 9 to1 and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife so this is the exact same angel that you read of in Revelation 10:7 this is the exact same tour guide that John was given in Revelation chapter 1 all right this is the signifying Angel verse 10 and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain now bear in mind he's going to show him the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great high mountain and he showed me that great City think about that he's going to take him to see the bride the Lamb's wife and he takes him to a high mountain and shows him the great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God so you can see the correlation between the bride and the city she's going to live in verse 11 having the glory of God and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone love this clear as Crystal amen let's pray father we commit ourselves into your hands for service now Lord and I pray that you will give us uh hearing Hearts today open our understanding of your word and Lord I I ask ask you to be with me in body and help me to be circumspect and use wisdom Lord for the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet so I'm going to exercise some of that today Lord with your permission I commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated praise the Lord we'll get as far as we need so I want to look at this 11th verse again having the glory of God you can go ahead brother Mark and put my PowerPoint up though I won't need the verse put up again and uh perfect we'll start right there turn it back on so I have a fresh cycling so he has taken J taken John to see the bride the Lamb's wife and he shows her he shows him a city and there's not a contradiction in the scripture what you're reading is actually a testimony it's a testimony concerning the bride amen because you're going to find out that these characteristics that describe the city also describe the bride because her record is now clear as Crystal she is even like a jasper stone that original Stone see and so we find that this is this is actually a perfect correlation of the city and the bride that's going to live there now so I'm going to say it like this the the inhabitants match the city the city matches the inhabitants Hallelujah and this is exactly why that the Bible says there will not be anything in that City and just paraphrasing the scripture that is contrary to the word no hor mongers no murderers no thieves there will be nothing in that City but Holiness and righteousness amen now if that's the case and the city is clear as Crystal then I'm here to tell you something friends your future is quite good because you're going to inhabit you're going to habitate in that City and your future is clear your testimony is clear and in fact the very word that we have here uh having the glory of God this actually this word in the in the Greek that they're using the glory of God is from we we read it most ministers know this it is the Greek word doca if I'm pronouncing that correctly and it has several derivatives and root words and meanings and doxes and Deo and but but what it means basically that having the glory of God having the doca of God this bride this city that bears the doca the glory of God is a root word that basically means to think or suppose and in in you know in in atmology when if you ever in Bible school atmology is the study of Words Their origin and their development over history amen is that easy going keep this real simple so so in atomology so so the the lexical says here etom atomically the word primarily means thought or opinion all right so it's an opinion uh as especially ially favorable human opinion and thus in a secondary sense reputation or or praise or honor that is bestowed upon you somebody holds you in high reputation amen they have a favorable opinion of you they are acknowledging Glory see it's not a presumptuous prideful thing the bride is there because she her reputation is glorious amen her the assessment of the Bride that inhabits that city is she was a Believer she reached Perfection she's Crystal Clear there's nothing against her she's in the image of Christ and the image of the bride and the image of Christ and the image of the city are all the same amen see so it means pray praise it means honor it means Splendor means light Perfection and now so thus doca of man now here's the problem you have the doca of man which is a human opinion of you but the problem with human opinion is that it's shifting amen yeah it could be up today down tomorrow amen that's that's how shallow the world is it doesn't matter how heroic you will be in the news tomorrow make a mistake or say the politically incorrect thing and watch cancel culture you know he say but but but I was a hero I did this and the answer that comes back from society is well what have you done for me lately yeah amen and that is a spirit on the age it's shallow it's ungrateful it it it don't that's why I say friends don't check face fortune and Glory of this world it's worthless amen amen it's so worthless that Jesus would not even accept it amen and they they come asking him you know who tell us you know they'd ask him one time by what Authority do you do this and then that became a discussion where they wouldn't answer his question he wouldn't answer theirs and then they're coming back you know and they're they're saying your witness is not true you're supposed to have a witness tell us who your Witnesses are that you're the Son of God and Jesus just looked him right in the eye and he said I don't accept the testimony of men first of all I don't accept it my father is my witness and that's it and you'll either believe his witness or you you'll you won't and he said and you won't see and you're going to die in your sins because you won't believe me you won't hear my words see and so so we find then Paul picks that up in the Book of Romans and he shows and I think I've was showing you this very recently that Paul says not only does a real servant of God not depend on the plotts of men he doesn't depend on acceptance of society not only does he not accept it he doesn't Chase it amen he doesn't try to get it he doesn't think about it the real servant of God cares nothing when brother brandham gave the analogy when that violinist was playing and he finished his piece the audience erupted in Applause and threw roses on the stage and they reporters noticed that he was ignoring the audience and he was looking up at the bo at the at the Box because there was Maestro there was his teacher and he only cared what his teacher thought Hallelujah it it what this is fine they're applauding they're clapping they're throwing roses but he was that meant nothing to him he wanted to know would his teacher rise and applaud and when he did then the man received see and so the we the beauty of this word is that that it is it is not the glory of people it's the glory of God Amen in other words it's not the world's opinion of you amen and I'm going to I'm going to go further it's not based on your opinion of you because sometimes I wonder whose opinion about me is worse the world or my own that's right when I look in the mirror and say you ungodly man how in the world you need to go to repent right now and and how come on is that right but I'm here to tell you that God is Not basing this on what you think of you he's not basing it on what others think of you it's his own opinion the glory of God was seen in her you say oh yeah it means God's glory no it means God's opinion of his bride it's God's opinion of you and me because we have believed the word after all it's God's opinion that marks the true value of things you see because that they're coming there's a reason for that why is it that you should just rest in the fact that it only matters what God thinks and the reason you should do that is because his you say but I I I've made so many mistakes and I'll probably make some more tomorrow but the beauty of it is no kidding his mind is eternal he already knows every mistake you all have made he already knows what you are now and he already knows every mistake you will make and he still says the glory of God is seen in her amen see so this is this becomes the beauty of the whole thing so brother brandham I'm going to give you a series of quotes here from brother brandham and well I must not have made that in WID screen apologize that's so narrow normally I I make that in in widecreen I apparently didn't do it but I think you'll be able to make it out so we're preaching today we're taking this logos becoming Rema it's part four in my series logos becoming Rema and here's what you should clearly understand by now the word becoming flesh amen I'm saying the same thing the top and the bottom are saying the same thing the word becoming flesh is the logos is this established word becoming this this moving and living through this that is the logos becoming Rema amen all right it starts out as an inspiration it comes as an anointing the the Lord brings forth a word that's sealed up completely and it's been sitting there for 20 centuries but then there comes a time when a prophet is on the earth and Time meets prophecy and God unseals it and Believers now read it with understanding and when they read it and they hear the interpretation they something within them says amen and you know that it's supernatural because it doesn't stop at mental agreement it literally begins reshaping your life remolding your character Hallelujah and so the word literally becomes flesh because when the books are closed for the last time Prophet said the word will be flesh yeah amen as I've said to you before that God never intended for his word to stay bottled up here this is the third iteration this is the third iteration the first iteration was in the stars the second one was in Enoch's pyramid the third one is in a written book that's been preserved by God for 2,000 years but I'm going to tell you something Jesus never had to carry this amen Jesus was this amen that's why he astonished the doctors said he's only 12 what school did he go to he hadn't been to any school he came from God he was God he was the word see but you there your your life operates under the Holy Ghost I'm going to prove it to you your life operates under the leadership of the Holy Ghost in ways that even you can't explain to someone from this book that's right amen and people say you know why are you this and why are you that and sometimes you can have a well because the Bible says this the Bible says that but there's so much about our life that can't be brought down to black and white text but you know like job I know whom I have believed I know my redeemer live it and and there's something driving my life in this direction and and I can try to explain it to you you may not even agree with it but I can't go back that's right amen hallelujah see amen now there's a reason that it happens like that and it's not because you became convinced mentally right the false church that the Bible speaks of has a form of godliness amen they as brother brandham said they actually admire the fine qualities of Jesus and so they they it creates a form of godliness in them but but to have the the real power take over their lives and start transforming them into the into this in flesh form they're not for that they have a form of godliness but they deny the power in other words I just believe it mentally I'm not going to alter anything I just agree with it and those are the ones that Jesus will say the king will say depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you and their testimony will be goodness we preached in your name and we did all these things in your name how have you not known us because they they they they they failed to accept the warning of the Holy Spirit they failed to accept the the the plan of God's provided way amen God has a prophet said one provided way of escape and that is to receive all of his word see say well I just I just you know I just believe Jesus wonderful so do I but do oh you know I I asked one determined unbeliever one time he said you know all I need all I need is Jesus at Calvary Calvary plus nothing and I said sure I agree with that to a certain point meaning that there's nothing I can do it's Calvary completely I had no way to save myself but that's not the whole program of God that's not all of redemption he said well how do you figure that Jesus said it's finished yeah Jesus said it's finished meaning that the purchase price had been paid but the claiming work still isn't done John was crying in the Book of Revelation because no one had claimed the book amen and John was standing on Calvary so close that he had a conversation with Christ you're not going to get more of a front row seat than John and even Jesus spoke to him son beh Behold thy mother speaking of Mary woman Behold thy son you couldn't get more of a front row seat than John and John watched him die and John met him again after he was born after he raised from the dead and John was on the hill when he ascended and John was in the upper room when his life came back you understand but yet John is only the island weeping because he knows that although the purchase work is completed if no one claims me I I my name's in that book but I can't don't do me any good it's sealed up I got to have somebody with authority who can step forward and say that's my book and open it and reveal and now John said Oh Heaven heard me shouting and praising God so you know I I I said to this young man I said imagine if you were standing there with John on okay you see yourself yeah you see Jesus dying yeah you believe in him yeah what's your testimony if you could speak to him what would it be Lord I believe you and trust you you know even even the thief said Lord remember me when you come in your kingdom right and I said now that's wonderful he said right so I'm finished I said okay wait I got another question after you left Calvary and after the day of Pentecost which is in the Bible and then the disciples his Apostles start writing letters and Paul starts pinning The Book of Romans and then he starts pinning First Corinthians and second Corinthians he goes on down through the list and starts pinning to Ephesians and Philippians and Colossians and goes on down and then Peter starts writing letters and first Peter and second Peter and first John and second John and third John and Jude wres and and I said do you think that you could find right standing in the presence of God by saying on the day of judgment well Lord I just believed you at Calvary but as far as Paul and Peter and John all those guys I didn't need them I didn't need all those letters Lord I believe you I didn't need their teachings I didn't need their doctrines you think that's going to pass the mustard no no sir I'm telling you what you're going to go to straight to hell because you have to take all the word of God you see friends that's why that's exactly why on the day of J listen brother brandham talks about that this bride at the end time will write another book of Acts you know when we write the last chapter we're writing it right now I'm about to prove it to you in the quotes you we're writing chapters uh continuation the book of Acts you got the book of Acts uh pre- Church ages and a book of a continuation of the book of Acts post Church ages amen and and this one is still being written yes amen and in fact is it when we it it's it's the record of Christ in Redemption so it'll that's why time continues on in the Millennium the account still continues on the Millennium we're still where the the the Heathen are raised up and civilization will carry right on but at the Judgment bar there's going to be one last chapter before Redemption is done and then the book of the last chapter of the of the book of Acts can be written and that will be on the day of judgment when your logos that became Rema and became flesh stands as a witness like Jesus said that on that day the queen of the South will rise in Judgment of this generation for she traveled at Peril of her life on that day the the people of Nineveh will arise and condemn this generation because they repented and that was just Nineveh and that was just that was just Jonah that was just a queen and and we talk about the days of Solomon he said but a greater than Jonah's here a greater than Solomon is here I'm here to tell you something friends on that last day the last chapter will be God will be just God will be righteous in that he will bring forth not his written word but his living bride and say My bride is proof that my word was true Hallelujah amen and it will be the testimony of Our Lives that the just judge can say you had the chance they lived right across from you they met twice a week you heard them on the Internet you saw their lives before you and you you only wanted the fine qualities of Jesus you had a form of godliness but you denied the power thereof depart from me you worker of iniquity sir because the word is being made flesh in you yes amen amen because of that that's good because they see your chased conversation amen not only your speech but your behavior they see your actions and reactions to the word of God saying Amen to the word is not just a verbal testimony it's a living experience on display that's what John saw he said come I'll show you the bride the Lamb's wife and he said he took me to a high mountain showed me that great City having the glory having the testimony of God saying this is my bride she matches my City My City matches me she matches me I match my word she is my word oh Hallelujah see amen so this is why it's so Paramount for us to always try to strive to be like Jesus and do always that which pleases the father Amen brother brandham says here an identification and I've got these these first ones in chronological order I'm going to drop back on the last ones but here it is and this is a prophetic challenge now this is the first of two that we're going to read about you ready for the first one amen 1963 I challenge you and the name of Jesus Christ to believe that this message of the holy spirit in this last days is the closing out of the world's history I challenge you to believe that I taught it to you tonight you believe that God sent me am amen amen so when it comes across like that there's really only one of two responses yes or noad I challenge you to believe that you believe that God sent me and this message that I'm bringing from the Holy Ghost is the message before the end of the world in the last days the closing out of the world's history amen you accept the challenge he comes th this was just prior to the seals he comes right after it now in this last day God has sent back the Holy Spirit which if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday day and forever then he is still the same Messiah and the and the life of Christ is in his church vindicating his word so now that that that invalidates any modernization yeah of the church amen any modernization because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday day and forever I remember when brother Ernie came out of he was first he was Church of Christ and then he I think was at UPC and at UPC was the the last one he moved before he moved into the ranks of the message and brother Ernie you know they they said to him oh brother Ernie you're going off in a cult you're you're going off the deep end you know we we have the revealed word of the hour and brother Ernie said okay well I got a question if somebody can just answer me this question please it'll help me maybe I maybe I'm making the wrong decision okay brother Ernie what's your question he said now we know historically and it's not hard because we only got started in the 19 in the 1900s we know and you don't have to look back very far that when the Pentecostal movement first began women didn't cut their hair and we know that women didn't wear garments that pertained to a man they didn't do that they observed the 2,000-year old custom of the church that women wore dresses they didn't wear pants they didn't cut their hair our Godly sisters in the original didn't paint their face up with war paint like Jezebel and hang all kinds of earrings and and and and look like brother M said look like you went through a five and dime with a magnet on Amen and he said our men didn't use to smoke and drink and and drink socially and curse when they get mad they didn't use to run gambling joints and casinos we didn't used to do those things in Pentecost now historically they couldn't deny that so brother but that wasn't brother Ernie's question that was just he was building his foundation to ask his question he says so here's my question did we start wrong or are we finishing wrong that's right my amen do not pass go do not collect $200 go directly to jail answer the question question right don't beat around the bush answer the question did we start wrong or are we finishing wrong I happen to believe they're finishing wrong because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and when the world sees you Godly sisters living like sisters always did And when they see you Godly Brothers Living Like Brothers always did then they won't have an excuse on the day of judgment because the word became flesh so and the life of Christ So Yesterday day and forever then he is still the same Messiah try to deny that and the life of Christ is in his church vindicating his word that's how God was in the earth in the form of Jesus Christ being the word to make the word live you catch that that's how he was the word because he made the word live he was a man man but he made the word live perfectly no one had ever been able to do that see and the holy now watch say oh yeah how great Jesus that was but watch and the Holy Spirit is today in flesh making the word of God live to every promise and every wonder and everything that he promised it's there now he promised more than Malachi 4 amen he promised more than Revelation 107 he also promised that in verses 8- 11 a bride John representing would call and take the book and eat the book and become the book so a prophet went home doesn't matter it doesn't stop Jesus Christ being the same yesterday today and [Music] forever see he goes on uh um week later the world is again falling apart he told Abraham now I'm just I'm giving you quotes that are all saying the same thing he told Abraham that's exactly what he would do and there watch this and there had to be someone come on the scene at that time to make the word just making sure I'm staying with myself here if I'm off course I shouldn't be but somebody get my attention so he says he told Abraham that's exactly what he would do and there had to be someone come on the scene at that time to do what to make the word live right before them so God gave the promise to Abraham so Abraham had to fulfill it brother brother said God would have never gave Abraham an unconditional Covenant like that do you realize what exposure God would have I mean that's that's business suicide you're talking about exposure of your company to to liability you know you know you got to have rules and regulations and you got to be able to hire and fire if somebody breaks uh goes outside the lines God came down to Abraham and said Abraham I'm going to sink my whole Kingdom on you and it has it's not going to it's and to make it sure he said it's not about what you've done or even what you will do I'm just here to tell you what I've already done I chose you that's it you're going to be my man and Abraham was and even Abraham himself backslid and went down to Egypt picks up Hagar brother Brandon talks about that and see does not air with a shook picked up that egyp Egyptian maid Israel is still to this day paying for that sin see CU through Hagar came Ishmael and so and that was a wild man but but we find that that didn't stop Abraham he got caught lying and cheating that didn't stop the promise he goes back and finds the king of the Philistines and starts doing the same thing starts lying and cheating trying to save his own hide that didn't stop it either that God plagued that King for getting lied to and God told that king that's his wife but Lord I'm an honest man the Integrity of my heart you know he told me it was his sister and the Lord said you're right I do I know you're a righteous King therefore I'm I'm trying to save your life restore his wife and ask him to pray for you and I'll forgive you so I got to wait a minut let me get this straight man lies to me comes into my territory lies to me and then now my my kingdom is plagued and I got to go to this liar this coward who was about to let me take his own wife and he's got to pray for me are you are you're going to finish me yep friends forget what the devil says about you do you understand God has already testified about this bride and what she is coming to and there is not enough devils in hell that can stop it that you are Sign Sealed you are already sitting in the presence of almighty God you're already believing the word that'll put you in that City someday so he says um so there had to come on the scene at that time to make the word live right before them that's why you're here God had sent his Moses down there and the very thing that he promised to do he did it because it was the anointed word for that hour you getting the picture amen you getting the picture he said it would judge the world God's word said I'll judge this that Nation with Great Mighty wonders and signs God said that to Abraham 400 years prior so Moses comes down the SC no wonder brother brandham said that morning he came down the trail that morning headed for his sheep that that headed for Jethro sheep he said that morning was different that morning when Moses came down the trail the pillar of fire was waiting on him come on Amen because time had met prophecy I'm here to tell you friends why are you a Believer cuz time met prophecy it said there'd be a bride here and she's here said she'd believe it she does said she'd become the word she is hallelujah yes sir see God's word said I'll judge the nation with Great Mighty wonders and signs there stood a man just an ordinary man like you or I got the word from God and went out there and spoke creation into existence picked up the sand and said let fleas come from the earth and the word of God through that prophet's mouth being it was right in the hour that it was supposed to be fleas covered the whole earth he covered the Earth with frogs he covered the with frogs and with lice he covered it with all kinds of PES exellence and things because God made the promise and the hour was there for it to be anointed the anointed word for that hour that they live in that's what we need today is not back in some Seminary system but anointed word for the hour that we live in to bring forth Jesus Christ to the world again to anoint you to do what right build a ciner no to bring Jesus Christ back to the world to display the truth how do how is it fair to the world if God destroys them and they never saw the revealed word I'm here to tell you something friends I know you don't feel like you deserve it I sure know we don't feel like we earn it but I know he has spoken and I know I believe it and I know it's becoming me every day I know that every day I'm ready to die aresh every night I'm ready to pin again every time I fail I'm ready to get back up what do you think's doing that cuz you're of some great caliber person no they we're all Sinners but God rich in Mercy placed a deposit of the word down inside you and you can't stop you I'm not talking about this you I'm talking about the other you the more real you won't let you be lost won't let you stop won't let you quit won't let you give up won't let you [Applause] disbelieve hallelujah praise God beautiful yes sir yes it is so he says right there at 67 that's what we need today is not back in some Seminary system but anointed word for the hour that we live in to bring forth Jesus Christ to the world again the same what are you bringing forth the same yesterday today and forever there is a program laid out for this day a promise of God and the only way will ever be able to get right is to let that word be anointed amen uh yeah to let that's what we need today is not back in some Seminary system but anointed word for the hour that we liveing to bring forth Jesus Christ to the world the same yesterday today and forever there is a program laid out for this day amen a promise of God and the only way that we'll ever be able to get right is to let allow permit now you've got Elijah speaking in Paul's language Let the mind which was in Christ be in you said to the Colossians that was to the Philippian to the Colossians he said let the word dwell in you richly are you willing am great are you are you doing it amen one thing to believe it it's one thing to be willing they said brother Ram said you say oh brother brand and we sure enjoyed that sermon brother R said thank you that's wonderful but my question is will you do it amen amen because you can block it why would he say let it if you if you didn't have to let it let the word dwell in you richly he comes a little later now we're in 1964 he's in the token the new token is the new life that comes through Jesus Christ when his blood was shed to sanctify a church fill it with his presence that why that why why we got token that he might manifest his word and his promise to the people say why do we have a token to give me overcoming power sure why do we have a token so I can go in the Rapture yeah why do we have a token so that I can have strength and be a believer yeah but why else do we have the token why are you here why did he give you his life so that you can so that he might manifest his word are you letting him token people token people how many got a token are you letting him it's up to you he won't take your token away but he's asking you a question will you let it see amen will you let that word be anointed or will you give your life over to Fortune and Glory come on is the is the primary purpose of your life higher education more money and social station you might be a token person but you're not doing that because you've got the wrong priorities in your life is the is this the house of correction does correction start at the house of the Lord is that where judgment starts so you're not mad at me are you I had to endure this studying it see so that's what the new the the the new token is for that he might manifest his his promises to the people now watch him go back into Hebrews God in sunry times and divers manners Hebrews 1 said he spoke to the fathers through the prophets now hold on how did he speak to them through flesh he anointed men this was prior to the sacrifice of the Lamb prior to the holy ghost coming upon God's family in fact is it's it's so prior that that the anointing couldn't even stay on the prophets amen that's why John was told upon whom you see the the spirit of God descend and remain that's a prototype that's a new kind of person you ain't seen that one see there was a time when that Pillar of Fire could could be with Adam and it it it could be there continually but now but now for 4,000 years that's been lost but there's coming a just one and when he comes and gives his life and ascends to the father to lay that body on the sacrifice the the altar of Mercy then he can send that life back in and now he can have a whole body around the world who are manifesting his word just like he did when he was in the earth oh my how could people not want that kind of a truth amen so he so how did he do it he spoke through prophets see but in the last days through his son now brother brandham is going Old Testament he's in the Keystone of the gospels where Jesus fulfilled that Paul's talking about Jesus Christ what now what what is his son the word amen the word was made flesh and dwelt among us this is why you are a son of God Amen you say I'm a Son of God because I've been born again how'd you get born again well because because I chose no no wait Jesus looked right at his disciples said you did not choose me I chose you amen you understand that you as I've said to you before the Book of Life brother brandham shows it's in two sections it looks like when you read it from the scripture sometimes looks like two different books brother brand said no it's not the same book but it's got a special section it's got an the Lamb's Book of Life has a section of election that that's his or origin that's his tribe that's his kin that's his family they come from him they were when when the pillar of fire was with God and was God you were the same was in the beginning with God why is he repeating himself cuz it's the whole family I was in Christ when that Pillar of Fire before the heavens and earth were even formed brother Brenham says before there was Stardust you existed de Hallelujah when he was with God and he was God and the same was in the beginning with God I came from God I go back to God why am I a Believer why do I have a token because I'm elected how am I elected because of the origin I came from him and and that's why only the predestinated are considered in Redemption we're not talking about basic salvation from destruction the foolish virgin or save from destruction heathens are raised up in the Millennium save from destruction to hear the gospel but I'm not saved just merely saved I'm redeemed so why am I so that once again the word can be flesh and dwell in Among Us I mean this is this is this is what is seen when the firstborn son son was expressed when he said let us make man he made brother said he made his whole family made all man his whole kingdom was in his mind all of his future sons and daughters down down to the all the way down to the consummation of everything he's not going to lose one amen see so I mean little wonder you know that I was seen in Christ before the formation of the heavens and the Earth and and I mean the that that's a real conundrum for Baptist Theology and because that's why they hate the word predestination yeah see because to them logically you understand logically to them well wait a minute if Christian if Christian if Christianity is believes in predestination then everything's already fixed and nobody really has free choice and that's why they have a problem with it yeah that's that's why they they can't get past that because because they they could say if everything is already fixed then what then what's the point of Acts two when they said to Peter what must we do and the implication was to be saved what we've killed the Messiah you told us there's still a chance it wasn't possible the grave could hold him God made him both Lord and Christ so what do we do now and Peter said repent why if I'm predestinated what's the point be baptized why and that's the Baptist argument it invalidates everything we're told in the Bible if predestination is true then it's all fixed and there's really no human Choice ultimately then why repent why do anything Paul picks up that exact human argument they they Paul Paul said you know you're going to argue you silly nut you're gonna argue that why don't I just go if if my evil and then God can save me makes God glorified then I should go commit some more evil and Paul said you're a fool to talk like that you know and then and they said well Paul if it's predestination then who hath resisted his will I'm only being why does he find fault with me if I was supposed to be a sinner and I am then he should be happy make sense humanly and Paul said you're an idiot he said you're C crazy to think like that amen you see the element that they're missing the reason it's such a jam in their mind is because they don't understand election amen that God provides a legitimate opportunity for all men who are in the Book of Life all Humanity everybody gets a legitimate chance to save themselves from destruction and God will grant them eternal life at the Judgment they've got a they can do that they and and it's even almost some very minimal requirements but but that's just salvation Redemption means he already owned you lost you then he brought you back that's why only the predestinated are considered in Redemption because the section of the Lamb's Book of Life has nothing to do with a choice I made or choice you made or I was a goody two shoes or I was evil had nothing to do with it I started in God I believe God I'm going back to God it is a it is the master of my life is his word amen and that's they don't understand that that that true election is fixed in origin see so so so for his family they they didn't choose to be his children they were always his children see all right I I got to stop in five minutes going to do it this time and this Revelation the completeness of Christ am whoever will add one word to it or take one word from it the same will be taken his part out of the book of life now he obviously says that because people do it yeah amen it's if people do it then it becomes apparent that there will be people who don't do it amen and it's not about Doctrine right it's about you being the word so that's why message light can't work amen that's why a watered down message that that seeks to to be mingled with M we need to update our thinking you know this was back in the 60s well that's nothing that's just young this thing goes all the way back 2,000 years ago I'm still believing 2,000 years ago why would I not believe from the 60s you got to be kidding how dumb is that it's even it's even closer to me I'm here to tell you you can't change you don't move the ancient landmarks the same yesterday day and forever you can't change yourself into something halfway between the word and halfway between the world you're not even in the economy of God if you do that you need the Holy Ghost you need to get to an [Applause] altar there is a revelation we only need the token with us to make make that word live again that's what he sent the token for am it's give us the state gives us a statement that we know is the truth let me let me let me read that real quick find my place yeah all right so in Paradox he he moves on now what is it Christ coming to his body word Christ in the word we all know the anointing is Christ that one that comes on the word that makes the word live see so it's it's not uh not putting an anointed word in us all right this I I accidentally put that inside the quote that's actually my own note that part right there so so it's so brother bam says the anointing is Christ that comes on the word that makes the word live so it's not putting an anointing an anointed word in us but anointing a word seed already in us from birth see and so so so so that's that's what he's showing here is that right that is the anointing Christ is the anointing the spirit that comes upon the word that makes the word live okay I think I oh I see why I did that so Christ is the anointing you with me the spirit that comes upon the word that quickens the word to make to make it live now the word is in your heart and you believe in Divine Healing whatever more see and Christ the anointing coming to his body see the connection there you you find he's looking for you to see a connection like husband and wife to become one GL now the church has got to get to the ministry until the church and Christ become one he can anoint you for every blessing that's in the Bible all of it is yours everything is Promised at this age is yours when we leave anything out see then if anointing strikes that it will anoint it you with me you believe it now today I'm finishing up he is still alive he is still here he is proving himself by his word the word is God you believe it amen and then this word is allotted here for this day that's got to be somebody amen somebody it's not a Doctrine it's a body it's got to be somebody come by that that word can become quickened and make that word live amen amen now Challenge number two and we're going to stop right here Anthony get get your team ready you ready for this second challenge amen you ready to accept it amen you going to believe every word promise you mean it I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of son of

recycle the Earth after mankind destroys himself from it and the bride will be in glory at a table thousands of miles long while The Madness of man becomes full and complete and he destroys his own self against his better judgment I don't want to be here I don't want you to be there at that time I want to be at that table thousands of miles long I want to come back when when the reboot occurs

Lord we want to confess our trust in you today Father we want to renew our allegiance to you Lord we've looked into the word of God today and we've seen some astonishing things we've seen that your plan is to is to sum it all up at the end time by having a bride walking in the so much in the way of your word that a prophet said so much so that it'll bring the Dead for hundreds and hundreds of years it'll bring them right out of the grave and it'll change us in a moment in the twinkling of an i we'll go to meet the Lord in the air we're in the process of that right now Lord the world is

by a message of the hour that it's all the word it's all the word it's all the word in just different forms whether it was the one that was with God or was God or the same was in the beginning with God whether it's the logos in our Bibles the established word whether it's the Rema acting out through flesh as long as it's the word of God and the Holy Spirit moving according to the word then that is the word Made Alive made flesh amen it it chokes the world Lord they can't grasp that but we joyfully we joyfully say oh God let me be a part of that Lord I raise my hands today father if there's anyone in here today who knows that they need to they we need to assess Lord deep down and say am I letting am I letting the word dwell in me richly am I allowing the anointing of God to come upon me
