========================================

feet go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we just want to open this service up today Father with Lord an invitation Lord for your presence to come and be welcome here father Lord I pray for each one Lord who sit in the pews here today Father Lord we've come to receive a word from you Lord so I pray that you could speak to us father Lord get both vessels out of the way father Lord and just Lord help us be conduits for your word father we love you and ask all these things now we dedicate them now to your service in the name of Jesus amen amen good morning Saints let's go and turn into our Bibles to Matthew the seventh chapter Matthew 7 and we're going to start at verse 13. Matthew 7. verses 13. and 14 it says enter ye at the Straight Gate for wide as the gate and Broad is the way that lead us to destruction and many there will be which go in there it because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it if we skip on down to verse 21 it says not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and then in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name have done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity we have one more just portion of scripture that I'm not even sure if we'll make it to today but I want to just to lay the foundation numbers 14. numbers 14 41-45 and it says and Moses said give you a second to turn there Moses uh numbers 14 and 41 says and Moses said wherefore now do ye transgress the Commandment of the Lord but it shall not Prosper go not up for the Lord is not among you that ye may be smitten before your enemies for the amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you and ye shall fall by the sword because ye are turned away from the Lord therefore the Lord will not be with you but they presumed to go up under the hilltop nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and Moses departed not out of the camp so Moses wasn't with him the prophet and the word of the Lord wasn't with him but they still decided to go then the amalekites came down and the Canaanites which dwelt in that land and smote them and discomforted them even unto horma you can take your seats this morning I just have a lot of material here before me so this will probably end up being two parts but Brother JD did schedule me twice this month so praise the Lord my subject this morning is the narrow way coming from the opening scripture there in the Book of Matthew when Jesus was actually preaching The Sermon on the Mount and he gave us some very vital directions and instructions if you want to hear an incredible sermon brother Branham picks that scripture up in 1959 preaches a sermon titled straight As the gate highly recommend it it's a convicting sermon we're actually going to go through several quotes and scriptures this morning I hope that's okay and the sermon Investments brother Branham talks and picks apart when the Rich Young Ruler uh came to Jesus in The Book of Mark Mark 10 17. and when he'd gone forth in the way there came running kneeling down to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit internal life and Jesus said unto him why callist thou me good there is none good but one and that is God so thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother he answered and said to the master all of these I have observed from my youth then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way and sell all that thy have and give to the poor and thou shalt have Treasures in Heaven and come take up thy cross and follow me and it says that he was sad at this saying and went away Greed for he had great possession we're all familiar with that story by Discerning the heart of this young man he recognized what was missing in his heart his true he had Treasures on Earth his possessions his lifestyle was keeping him from moving all the way with with what Jesus had wanted for him in his life so he had a knowledge of the scripture he obviously followed the Commandments he followed them he said it followed him since since he was a boy and he had the opportunity to take the way with the Lord Jesus he Jesus discerned his heart and says look this is what you're missing this is the missing link and and why you're feeling this way this is it just do this just want this one thing and he couldn't do it he couldn't bring himself to do it he had Treasures on Earth and it kept him in the place that he was at and he went away grieved in his heart didn't make the right choice one of the many deceptions I believe with the modern gospel we hear today is making your way into Heaven by being a good person and Jesus absolutely tears that argument apart in that scripture he says that there is no good there is not one good and save God alone and when Jesus comes in the latter part of his Sermon on the Mount after saying that the way is narrow and only a few will be that find it Jesus because he's all-knowing he knew that when the time came for everyone to come to that great white throne in judgment every single person would have to give an account of their life and the things they did and we're with the scripture we read it says Lord Lord did I not prophesy in Your Name Lord did I not preach your gospel and one of the one of the deceptions is they'll say I you know I profess Christianity on Earth I said I was a Christian I went to church I gave tithes you know I lived a pretty good life I gave to the poor I was a pretty good person overall you know that's that's a deception I was a pretty good person overall there's there's none good no not one he would say to them depart from me you workers of iniquity because he's Discerning their hearts their hearts wasn't it he provides a way out of that life he sent his son he sends his word he lays it on you know a preacher's heart to get up on Sunday mornings to teach Sunday school to give an opportunity to find out what the narrow way is and how to escape that kind of Destruction yet many continue in a worldly lifestyle Jesus said you prophesied my name but your life proved that you wanted nothing to do with me because by their fruits you shall know them the word that word straight straight is the gate it's actually not spelled like straight it's actually spelled s-t-r-a-i-t which means a narrow passage of water and so the only way through this narrow passage of water is to be Washed by the Water of the word and that's the word that we have here the Rich Young Ruler lived a pretty good life I would say he probably lived a better life than most Christians Christians do today he followed all the Commandments of the law since he was a boy he was sincere but sincerity does not prove your obedience to the word of God he lived he lived right but he knew something was still missing in his heart there was a missing link and he wasn't connected to God in the way that he knew he should be and Jesus gave him that Missing Link he gave them the remedy the final step Surrender Your Life For Me live for me abandon your life of comfort but he was comfortable he couldn't come to a full surrender and when he comes to the end of his life his life the scripture and brother random picks us up he says he looked up from hell it said he looked up from his torment and he called out Father Abraham he was conscious of who he was and where he was and the incredible story The Incredible thing about the event in history rather random accounts when he sets the drum up doesn't say that he backslid at that point and just to speculate I I would think that he probably kept living that way he probably kept going to church he probably kept doing those kind of things and and after a while that conviction that the Lord had put on him just started to to die out a little bit and after a while of ignoring conviction that the Lord places on your heart it begins to become less and less and eventually it just won't be there anymore maybe he still went to church maybe he still professed God but when there came a time to show what was truly in his heart he denied it you know we can't pick and choose what we want to follow in God's word and expect to be real Christians the Bible said the path is narrow and few will be that finds it you know this new age I hope this is all right I know this is a little a little hard this morning but it just what the Lord placed on my heart the new age version of Christianity that expresses love and acceptance but doesn't condemn sin I'm here to declare that that is absolutely wrong that is not the gospel it is against the Bible if it's not line upon line and precept upon precept like the word says then real true born-again Christians should want nothing to do with him you know modern day preachers uh they're they're preaching this that's leading people to hell and destruction you know I serve I serve a holy God I've seen some of some of the more modern day preachers I was watching this excerpt from this video not too long ago they get behind a a this sacred desk which I I think is the most sacred desk that you can get behind and they preach to thousands where and whatever they want to wear they're laying on on the ground there's no reverence to God laying on the stage making the gospel a show when the gospel is not a show I believe that this gospel requires reverence there in the book of Isaiah when he had the vision of the Lord the Holy Angels had to cover their sinless faces to stand in the presence of God angels that knew no sin had to cover their faces to stand in the presence of God how much more should we as Sinners saved by grace give reverence to our holy Lord to respect his presence first Peter 4 says for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what shall the end of them be that obey not the gospel and if the righteous listen if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and The Sinner appear the righteous scarcely be saved my goodness it's a narrow way Saints and to even think about disrespecting him the way that they do sometimes and to stand there and express that they follow Jesus and then preach and teach on things that are an Abomination to God preach that same-sex marriage is allowed when it's against the order of God's word preach that living on any old way dressing in the old way is okay when the Bible I read says true believing Christians have a standard to uphold and not because they just want to or desire it or manufacture it it's because if you're truly Born Again by the spirit of God it's literally The Life of Christ Living Through you brother Branham says this an influence a powerful sermon he says even Christians today who claim to be Christians smoke and drink and cheat and found dishonest why it's no wonder that Christianity is one of its as is at it's one of its low Ebbs in all time it's the influence the church has placed upon men that hasn't received Christ men wants to maintain their testimony and then live any old way they want but that's the reason the holy spirit is a a definite must in this day because it is the one that lives your life for you you don't live it yourself it's Christ in you then after you have received the Holy Spirit and if he doesn't have the preeminances in your life then you just remember at the sound under anybody under the sound of my voice if you're not sure if you have the Holy Ghost just remember the prophet teaches if you not if you're not sure if he doesn't have the preeminence of your life you just remember you have not received the Holy Spirit because if he is in you he'll live his own life and you're no more of your own young young people and and anybody who had that question you know do I have the Holy Ghost here's simple instructions from the prophet of God if he doesn't have the preeminances if he is not at this at the Forefront of every decision that you make then you have not received the Holy Spirit is he preeminent in your life this morning is he more important than your job is he more important than your Recreation is he more important than your social life you are dead and your life is hidden God he says through Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost so there is no way at all for you to be yourself no more what you were there's just no possible way to be your old self again if it's just profession then your actions and your life will declare it and buy your fruits that the things that you do by the way you act by the way you live they will declare whose spirit is living in you you know I've heard several times people in conversation say that Jesus came to take away our sins and had abolished the Old Testament laws but it did just the opposite of that or they'll say because Jesus knew that we couldn't be without sin that's why he died but that's a misuse of his grace and mercy it magnified those laws brother random says Christ came to magnify the law he says in 1958 the baptism of the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Spirit paragraph 35 he says and Christ came to magnify the law he said you've heard them say of Old Times Thou shalt not kill but I say unto you whoever is angry with his brother Without a Cause has killed already magnified it you heard him say of Old Times doubt shalt not commit adultery that was the ACT but I say unto you whoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery magnified it thousands of times Well if it's taken 14 generations of that to fade out then what about the magnifying glass of God is thrown on it he says this in Christ is the mystery of God revealed wearing shorts and slacks and those things the Bible said any woman that will oh you say that put on a garment that pertains to a man it's an Abomination to God filthy dirty like an old stinking bathroom somewhere see oh my the filth in God's nostrils and then you pray or offer up prayers and such a thing as that God refuses it and turns it away that's right well you say now wait a minute brother random you're talking about the Old Testament he is the same yesterday today and forever and it's the full revelation of God God ever says anything he can never change it he always magnifies it never changes it the law was magnified not changed whoever commits adultery shall be guilty of death but whosoever now magnified looketh upon a woman to lust after he never changed the Commandment he magnified it and that's moving down to paragraph 411 he says and they would not hear it and they wagged their heads and walked away for their denominations uh-huh this is the refreshing see magnifying the Sabbath day to you sabbatarians and so forth Oh my he don't change he magnifies it and hell has spread her gates open to receive them my goodness by magnifying it he gave the Holy Ghost because it would seem impossible to be able to maintain a life like that but by magnify it magnifying it then he gave the Holy Ghost so that we could obtain a life that his life could keep through us the Old Testament had laws and but they didn't have they didn't have a holy ghost living on the inside to keep their sinful nature from such things they had experiences of God and experiences of the Holy Ghost but never an indwelling like we have access to today the Bible teaches us in Matthew 24 37-39 that as it was in the days of Noah then so shall it be at the coming of the son of man in Noah's day God gave a message to Noah that you are to build a boat with this specific wood with these specific dimensions and this is how you will be saved and he preached that message for 120 years and no doubt people started looking at Noah's boat and started mocking him maybe at some point they started to get their own ideas and how they would build their own boat you know they got their ideas maybe maybe Noah's wood didn't seem like the kind of wood that they would use so that maybe they're all that that's that doesn't make sense to use that kind of wood but the thing was Noah's boat it was that it was God constructed I hope these quotes are okay I love quotes brother Branham says in 1962 and the way that with people today they say I belong to a church I do this I do that but there's only one group that's God constructed and that's not a denominational construction it's a word Construction in Revelation of his power God constructed boat don't presume just believe God's word I don't think we'll have time to get into it today but he says in this message presuming when you look into numbers you know you see how these Israelites they presumed that God would go with them because God was a good God and and we're his people but he had a way in order and he said don't do that he gave them warning and they went and did it without the prophet and without the the Ark of the Covenant or without the ark and they died Noah constructed that vote out of a certain kind of wood wish we had time to go into it but we don't it's lighter than Balsa he says it's the lightest wood but that's the way God does it he just pulls them right over there they set their ignorant at jackrabbits he says it was cut from something that seems unreasonable but it was cut from God's word there's a whole lot of boats today and there's a whole lot of messages out there but are they cut from God's word are they cut from God's word are there critics sure there are are there websites websites and people who you know spend their precious time trying to get everyone to disbelieve is there criticism from family members about the way we live about the way we dress about the things we do or most often maybe the things that we don't do sure sure there is but we ought to thank God for those things because anything that is sent from Jesus ought to look like Jesus and the Jesus that I read was an outcast the message of Jesus was unpopular people who said that they were followers of Jehovah in the Old Testament they denied Jesus and his ministry and people do the same thing today they say that they are Christians they go to church but their life proves they don't want anything to do with the Jesus of the Bible the Bible I read is where Jesus condemns sin and sin for living the Bible I read says when Jesus started preaching Doctrine if you go reading the gospels that's when most of his disciples or when most of his followers stopped following him when I see preachers so when I see preachers and teachers that are on movements of Jesus Culture and you know brother Jason preached on it and brother JD has preached on it you know preaching a modern day Christianity that does not condemn sin you know big name preachers married two or three times what is their life produced by their fruits you know them but then I see a Ministry like like brother branham's Ministry lived a clean life what does his ministry demonstrate through message Believers Godly living honorable people sanctified people people that looked a whole lot like the Bible that I read about people who looked a whole lot like the Saints in the Old Testament in the New Testament amen Godly living then all the criticism all the doubt all all that stuff it vanishes because it's the whole it's the Holy Ghost producing those lives it's not anything that I I can do or manufacture it's not anything that we can do it's God in you it's not your pastor it's not your brother it's not your sister it's the Holy Ghost In You proving that living his life through you that looks to me like the Jesus of the Bible and I don't know about any of you this morning but that's who I want to identify with there's all kinds of identity crisis now going on we can you can Google things like that and I you know identifying as anything and everything but I want to identify with the Jesus of the Bible that's who I want to identify with glory to God there's only one boat that's going to get us out of here and that'll be a ward construction word constructed message sent unadulterated vote it'll be cut from the materials of the word of God it'll line up so exactly with what God's word says to do how it says to live how it says to act you know I've heard brother brother Jason preaches for years as I've grown up you know dying doesn't it just changes your Dwelling Place you don't die and then some more magic formula takes place and you're taken to heaven and then all of a sudden you're changed into a holy being your heart is pure you're you're living a life of of of Holiness under the Lord now that happens here we submit ourselves unto the unto God and the leading of God's spirit he comes in he clean cleanses us out now that of course we have mistakes and we fall but then we come running to the altar when that kind of thing happens because we want to be right with God because that Holy Ghost is living in us he can't live in an unclean vessel so we submit ourselves to the leading of God's spirit and then when he comes in he cleans us up and he makes us holy amen not by you not by anything you do but it's by God living in you that's what makes you a holy creature unto God by purifying now right now this is our purification time by the washing of the water of the word continually every single day that quote brother Branham says there it just I mean if there was ever a question in anybody's heart if I do I have the Holy Ghost it's it this instructions are simple does God have preeminence in everything you do does he have preeminence in the decisions you make and the job you choose in the places you go and the people that you see and the things that you allow into your mind in the entertainments of this life in the in in everything does he have preeminence would he feel comfortable going where you go would he feel comfortable being with you at all times do you have you know do you do you live a life that is that is Holy unto the Lord and if you don't maybe it's time to to re-examine what's on the inside of our hearts and re-examine who we're living for re-examine the Bible that that you're reading because the Bible I read says that there's a Holiness that we live under the Lord and it's not by what's what you do it's by what God does through you amen I think this is a good uh us a good stopping point I've got a lot a lot of more here this morning but um let's just all stand to our feet this morning I love you I love you all amen praise the Lord let's just bow our hearts Heavenly Father Lord we're so grateful and thankful father for your word Lord we pray that it could just seed into our hearts Lord and change us and mold us and shape us Lord let us just be let us have materials that are God constructed in our life father God just give us something Lord God today and service father I pray that you just wash Us by the water of your word I pray that you anoint your servant Lord as he comes out here in just a few moments Lord Jesus I pray that you'd anoint the the music team father as they come out here Lord let their let their Atmos Let Your Atmosphere be so welcome here father God we just lay aside every weight Lord everything that besets us now and we just offer up Lord Praises unto you our God In The Name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you all
