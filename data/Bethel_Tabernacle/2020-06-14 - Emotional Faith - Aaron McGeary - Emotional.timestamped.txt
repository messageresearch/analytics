[42:54] down there now but you might it might
[42:57] have changed his mind let's just take
[43:00] her Bibles that turn to second
[43:01] Corinthians chapter 10 very happy to be
[43:04] here together with you today and
[43:08] considered a great honor yesterday's
[43:10] ministers meeting was tremendous for
[43:12] myself personally I told brother Tim I
[43:15] felt just for myself that the trajectory
[43:18] of the men's meet the ministers meetings
[43:20] and what they had been doing over these
[43:21] many years just Lord knew that I would
[43:24] intersect at this juncture and it was
[43:26] just perfect for where I'm at in my life
[43:28] I'm very very grateful for it and the
[43:30] different ones that supported it I
[43:31] considered a great honor again to be
[43:33] here in fellowship with you today and
[43:37] we've expressed before just how much we
[43:38] appreciate the ministry here brother
[43:40] Jason and sister Debbie have just been
[43:42] very very good friends to sister
[43:43] Elizabeth and I have been instrumental
[43:44] and the Lord leading us and guiding us
[43:46] you have tremendous ministry here in the
[43:48] church and even if I think about brother
[43:50] Dale the Lord used him in my life
[43:53] appreciate his ministry and then now
[43:55] that he's pastoring in Arizona I think
[43:56] it's just a compliment to to the church
[43:59] here and then the Jason de maras
[44:02] ministry I've enjoyed his friendship
[44:04] ministry and then I think I'm on hold
[44:05] with brother Matthew still right now in
[44:07] the office but his friendship and
[44:10] ministry I just think of my God's really
[44:12] blessed this assembly with wonderful
[44:15] ministry and myself personally I've been
[44:16] benefited not only by the ministry but
[44:18] the friendships and so I just I want to
[44:20] just express that if I haven't said it
[44:21] before how much we love you and we've
[44:23] appreciated the gifts and your assembly
[44:25] and the friendships that they've been to
[44:26] us so I wanted to say that this time
[44:29] since we had another chance to do it and
[44:31] we love you and thank you for the
[44:33] opportunity to be here second
[44:34] Corinthians chapter 10 verses 4 & 5 we
[44:39] know that the book of Corinthians both
[44:41] books are books
[44:42] correction and Paul is having to deal
[44:46] with a lot of carnality in the church
[44:47] and in verses 4 and 5 year of 2nd
[44:51] Corinthians chapter 10 it says for the
[44:53] weapons of our warfare are not carnal
[44:54] but mighty through God to the pulling
[44:58] down of strongholds and I believe this
[45:01] is so instructive to this church that
[45:03] was operating largely in the flesh and
[45:05] carnally casting down imaginations and
[45:08] every high thing that exalteth itself
[45:10] against the knowledge of God and
[45:12] bringing into captivity every thought to
[45:16] the obedience of Christ
[45:18] if we could just bow our heads in prayer
[45:20] gracious Heavenly Father thank you for
[45:21] the privilege we have of being assembled
[45:24] in this sanctuary
[45:25] Lord a mindful of those in the alphabet
[45:28] who just by just by prudence and wisdom
[45:31] the the church here has agreed the
[45:34] pastor together with those that labor
[45:36] with them and the assistant pastor that
[45:38] Labor's with you Lord made the decision
[45:40] to divide it among the alphabet Lord we
[45:43] just pray for those of this assembly who
[45:44] aren't here that where they are you
[45:47] could just come to them Lord in and and
[45:52] make them feel a part of this for we
[45:55] know that this the separation this
[45:56] distance is difficult Lord and preaching
[45:59] here I know that there's Arizona
[46:00] believers streaming in father that that
[46:03] are hungry for the word of God and and
[46:05] desirous to have you speak to them so
[46:07] Lord we just pray that wherever they may
[46:08] be Lord wherever they might be right now
[46:11] we just pray that they would feel a part
[46:13] of this service law part of the larger
[46:15] body of Christ if not the Assembly hear
[46:17] and speak to them from your word for the
[46:19] time that we're living in we commit all
[46:21] thanks to you now and ask this in the
[46:23] name of Lord Jesus Christ amen and you
[46:26] may be seated
[46:33] yeah I got the my title is emotional
[46:37] faith and before you assume we're where
[46:43] I'm going with this subject or you think
[46:45] wow if he's preaching on emotional faith
[46:46] this is where he's going to end up
[46:48] I'd like you to broaden broaden your
[46:51] expectations a little bit because I plan
[46:53] on going there and everywhere else too
[46:55] and just try to be right down the middle
[46:57] of the road in this subject and
[46:59] emotional faith is the title but I'm
[47:02] also wanting to make intellectual faith
[47:05] akin to emotional faith and I'd like you
[47:08] to see that connection as we go forward
[47:10] because I'm speaking about emotional
[47:12] faith and I think that we ought to
[47:13] connect intellectual faith as well to
[47:17] emotional faith and it's a broad subject
[47:19] but I want to approach it in a way to
[47:21] encourage genuine faith in Christ just
[47:24] to reassure you about the faith that you
[47:25] have in the word of the Lord how God
[47:28] confirms that faith and just how we are
[47:30] this is a walk of faith if God has
[47:32] birthed his church in faith and going to
[47:35] and then one day is gonna take her off
[47:36] the earth it's going to be faith that's
[47:39] why brother BAM said the rapture is a
[47:40] revelation and he also said the new
[47:43] birth is a revelation and we know faith
[47:44] is a revelation so if you begin in faith
[47:47] and this ends in faith then God's not
[47:49] gonna abandon the principle of faith to
[47:51] get us out of here and in intellectual
[47:55] faith I want to start perhaps with just
[47:57] defining this because I think we have
[47:58] maybe their own ideas when it comes to
[48:01] emotional faith but if we were to define
[48:03] intellectual faith it resides within the
[48:06] human emotions and that's why I want to
[48:08] make them synonymous intellectual faith
[48:10] and emotional faith it this kind of
[48:13] faith resides in our human emotions it's
[48:15] a faith that's more related to our human
[48:17] spirit and our minds as opposed to
[48:20] genuine faith which resides and is
[48:22] anchored in our soul so being we being
[48:24] soul spirit body there can be an
[48:26] intellectual and emotional faith that is
[48:29] in that spirit realm of the man and
[48:31] maybe even just in the physical sense
[48:33] something is transpiring that the spirit
[48:36] the spirit of a man identifies with and
[48:38] that gives him some sort of confidence
[48:40] and that would be the intellectual
[48:42] emotional faith we're talking about but
[48:44] genuine faith from God
[48:46] anchors in the soul and it's actually
[48:48] independent of any sort of sensation or
[48:51] emotion that a person may be having in
[48:53] their spirit or in their body there's
[48:55] times that you have to go by faith apart
[48:58] from what your affection is telling you
[48:59] your memories telling your imagination
[49:02] is telling you all those different
[49:03] things you know and faith anchors in
[49:05] your heart it's apart from all those
[49:07] other things and so intellectual faith
[49:11] emotional faith is both dead and formal
[49:13] on one side but then also emotional and
[49:17] seemingly fanatical on another and so we
[49:20] often maybe just pin one on intellectual
[49:23] faith it's just all cold and formal but
[49:24] intellectual faith can be dead and
[49:27] formal on one hand but it also can be
[49:29] very expressive and energetic on another
[49:31] hand and so intellectual faith will
[49:34] manufacture either emotionalism or
[49:36] formalism it's not that it only tends to
[49:39] one it'll do both intellectual faith
[49:41] will manufacture emotionalism where
[49:43] there's a lot of sensation a lot of
[49:45] expression but that it can also
[49:46] manufacture formalism where there's a
[49:48] restraint or a barrier to expression but
[49:52] genuine faith produces expressive
[49:54] emotions and then also a quietness of
[49:56] stillness and a confidence in genuine
[49:59] faith it can produce expressive worship
[50:01] genuine faith can produce a signs and
[50:04] wonders that might be in terms of gifts
[50:06] and and manifestations but then it can
[50:09] also bring a real steady reverence and a
[50:11] resolve and a quietness to somebody but
[50:14] how that faith is working is from the
[50:15] inside out and I want to just add this
[50:21] as we begin I'm not preaching against
[50:22] the against emotional faith and
[50:25] certainly not preaching against emotions
[50:27] because we are emotional beings and to
[50:31] preach against emotions would just be
[50:32] the pre preach against the very way that
[50:34] God made man and the and the very fact
[50:37] that we that there's fruits of the
[50:39] Spirit and if you look at the fruits of
[50:41] the spirit they're connected with human
[50:43] emotions and so if we try to take
[50:45] emotion out of the gospel emotion about
[50:47] our experience and we're actually just
[50:48] trying to make us non-human but what's
[50:51] important is to understand that our
[50:53] emotions must align with the word and
[50:56] that's maybe more what I'm looking at is
[50:58] just trying to pull from different
[51:00] to show that we must be aligned in the
[51:02] word and if we're in the word and under
[51:04] the word then that's the proper channel
[51:06] that our emotions can be expressed
[51:08] because there's gonna be times when
[51:09] you're gonna have disappointments and
[51:11] and sadness and emotions of
[51:13] discouragement and it's okay to have
[51:15] those emotions because God will actually
[51:18] use those emotions to deal with you that
[51:20] the feeling the feeling of godly sorrow
[51:22] it's an emotion leads one to repentance
[51:25] so without even the feeling of sorrow
[51:27] you could not appropriately repent and
[51:29] God will even use regret to cause you to
[51:32] moderate behavior and he'll deal with us
[51:34] in our emotional realm but he does it
[51:36] not that we may remain emotional or
[51:38] become subject to the emotions but
[51:40] identify that God is wanting to lead us
[51:43] by dealing with us in that realm to
[51:45] bring ourselves subject to the Word of
[51:47] God and there'll be times in your lives
[51:49] when you experience great loss and
[51:50] hardship and sorrow estrangement from
[51:52] family and you can't bury that emotion
[51:55] and say there's nothing to it we know
[51:56] it's very very real very very raw and it
[51:58] can be very visceral the way we want to
[52:00] express it but what we must do is make
[52:02] those emotions subject to the word now
[52:06] brother branham makes this statement and
[52:08] earnestly contending for the faith he
[52:11] says Paul was down here in the natural
[52:13] realm with his PhD he had an
[52:15] intellectual faith but he didn't have a
[52:17] divine faith there's quite a difference
[52:20] in me having an intellectual faith than
[52:23] a divine faith there's where you he says
[52:25] my Baptist friends fail to go on so he's
[52:28] identified if we look at that
[52:30] theological II that the Baptist are
[52:32] really good at believing but they they
[52:34] put a period on it and they remain in
[52:36] that realm of intellectual assent or
[52:38] acknowledgement of truth
[52:39] he says you get the intellectual faith
[52:42] by that but it must be a divine
[52:44] revelation of Jesus Christ to you that
[52:47] just come out of the heart intellectual
[52:50] faith is not enough not to say it's not
[52:53] enough means it is something but it's
[52:55] not sufficient it's good to have but you
[52:59] want more that's alright but it only
[53:01] brings you to the Holy Spirit the Holy
[53:05] Spirit is a personal experience of the
[53:08] birth the new birth regeneration making
[53:12] a new creature in
[53:13] Christ so you can believe but there must
[53:17] be a going on and I realize this is very
[53:19] very basic and fundamental to you and as
[53:21] I've said before it's not a cheap trick
[53:22] to try to get a lot of amens it's just
[53:24] to kind of walk you through these things
[53:26] so you know where I'm beginning to know
[53:28] where I'm going so I said you can have
[53:30] intellectual faith it brings you to the
[53:33] door of the Holy Ghost so to speak it
[53:35] brings you to that place of surrender
[53:36] but there must be a greater surrender
[53:40] and a yielding to then come to the birth
[53:43] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so
[53:46] he's saying that's what you come the
[53:47] Holy Ghost is a personal experience of
[53:49] the new birth it's a personal revelation
[53:51] of Jesus Christ to you so intellectually
[53:55] believing the message does not give you
[53:57] a Holy Ghost experience no matter how
[54:00] convinced you are about the message and
[54:02] you may not reason with it you may not
[54:04] argue with that you may not ever debate
[54:06] it you may be absolutely convinced of it
[54:08] but that in itself is not a personal
[54:11] experience of the new birth I realize
[54:14] this can kind of get turned around on us
[54:16] so we get a little bit confused because
[54:18] there's only one evidence of the baptism
[54:20] of the Holy Ghost and that's to have a
[54:21] clear understanding and there's only one
[54:24] evidence of the Holy Ghost and that's
[54:25] the believe the word for your day
[54:27] there's no other evidences of it no
[54:28] other sensations emotions or anything
[54:30] else but you have to realize that just
[54:32] that might seem to be a little bit of a
[54:34] paradox but what what must be understood
[54:37] is there must be an anchor of a personal
[54:40] experience with the word that this
[54:43] intellectual faith has brought you to
[54:45] where in you our birth into the body of
[54:47] Christ you become a new creature in
[54:49] Christ Jesus your soul and God locked
[54:51] together and you become one and no
[54:54] matter what you go through in life your
[54:55] ups and downs and your different
[54:57] standings and no matter how
[54:58] shell-shocked you get there's a part of
[55:00] you that can say I know I've met him
[55:02] face to face and you know where you're
[55:06] standing just as Paul instructed those
[55:09] that he came in contact with in Acts
[55:11] chapter 19 he said have you received the
[55:14] Holy Ghost since you believed and he's
[55:16] asking this question because he says it
[55:19] well he's asking them about the Holy
[55:21] Ghost cuz that's the promise of the day
[55:22] and you knew they were believers but he
[55:27] won
[55:27] to know if they had received the Holy
[55:28] Ghost since they believed and they say
[55:32] well we have not even so much have heard
[55:34] as whether there was a Holy Ghost so
[55:36] then he's thinking well how have you
[55:37] been taught but to what we had you've
[55:39] been baptized too because he understood
[55:42] that the problem even now brother
[55:44] Branham told us that if you don't have
[55:46] the Holy Ghost he says I'm not scolding
[55:47] your friends but God's obligated to give
[55:49] you the Holy Ghost as soon as you've
[55:51] obeyed his word in repentance and
[55:53] baptism and the name of Lord Jesus
[55:54] Christ he says you're either mist taught
[55:56] you don't understand or something's
[55:58] wrong somewhere
[55:59] because God's obligated to give it to
[56:02] you so here Paul begins to look at how
[56:04] they were taught and they were not
[56:05] taught appropriately so he then
[56:07] appropriate that faith and takes that
[56:10] intellectual faith that they had and
[56:12] then brings the revealed word of that
[56:14] day and then that faith dropped down
[56:16] into a revelation and they're baptized
[56:18] they received the Holy Ghost and are
[56:19] baptized correctly and so this is a
[56:22] pattern we see in the scripture
[56:24] something brother branham amplifies
[56:25] quite a bit through his ministry it's
[56:27] not just believing but it's receiving
[56:30] the Holy Ghost as a confirmation of that
[56:32] faith the genuine experience of the new
[56:35] birth is the seal of your faith that is
[56:38] what that is what brings the seal is
[56:40] your faith listen no matter how how you
[56:43] want to cherry-pick from the message
[56:45] brother Branham is very clear on this
[56:46] the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is
[56:49] the new birth is the seal of your faith
[56:52] he's not sealing your good works she's
[56:55] not sealing the fact that you sanctified
[56:57] yourself he's not sealing the fact that
[56:59] she erased your Spotify playlist and
[57:01] he's not he's not he's not he's not
[57:03] sealing the fact that you deleted
[57:05] Netflix from your iPad he's sealing your
[57:07] faith in God seal in your faith in the
[57:11] word and this cannot be substituted it
[57:15] cannot be substituted it cannot be
[57:17] substituted through through apologetics
[57:19] to where we have everything outlined in
[57:21] the message every T crossed every I
[57:23] dotted everything just wrapped up very
[57:25] perfectly even his brother Jason was
[57:27] mentioning yesterday just some kind of
[57:29] unifying theory to everything where it
[57:31] all makes sense and you go I approve I
[57:33] second that motion
[57:34] you've got to have a new birth
[57:36] experience
[57:37] and that Pentecostal experience which
[57:40] was instituted into the body of Christ
[57:41] and birthed the body of Christ on the
[57:44] day of Pentecost the very moment that
[57:46] God brought that Pentecostal experience
[57:48] that experience has been a part of every
[57:51] single bride members life from the
[57:53] beginning brother Bram said every age is
[57:56] the age of the Holy Ghost for the
[57:57] believer and so every individual
[58:00] regardless of what the dispensation was
[58:02] tight as every individual has had to
[58:04] have a Pentecostal experience in order
[58:07] to be a part of that body and the
[58:11] Pentecostal experience is based upon the
[58:13] Word of God in nothing else when this
[58:17] Pentecostal outpouring happened in the
[58:19] book of Acts it was it was an experience
[58:22] with the word it was according to the
[58:25] word they have to understand that those
[58:28] that and even when we talk about those
[58:31] that in the Pentecostal organizations
[58:33] today they're trying to somehow repeat
[58:36] what happened in approximate and
[58:38] simulate what took place in the book of
[58:40] Acts but yet they're not recognizing
[58:42] that when they went to the upper room
[58:45] they were doing it according to the
[58:47] revealed word of that day the the climax
[58:50] of the ministry of Jesus Christ was a
[58:52] hundred and twenty people in an upper
[58:55] room scared to death but under a
[58:57] commandment that the Holy Ghost would
[58:59] come and when that happened that brought
[59:02] forth the new body the of the Jesus
[59:05] Christ it birthed the church and then
[59:07] from then on that experience is for as
[59:10] many as the Lord our God would call and
[59:14] that experience has continued even in
[59:17] the age that we live in now but we
[59:19] realize now that the revealed word of
[59:21] the hour is not pointing us to an upper
[59:23] room experience but pointing us to a
[59:25] meeting in the air and at the very
[59:27] climax of the Christ in this day is it
[59:31] is to take a body change and to be
[59:33] translated
[59:36] so with this experience it cannot be
[59:39] based upon intellect it cannot be based
[59:42] upon emotions upon sensations or any
[59:44] kind of feelings and we cannot have
[59:47] bring to bring any other evidence in
[59:50] view and I was and I I feel like as
[59:57] believers we've really maybe we've moved
[59:58] on a little bit from kovat 19 and the
[1:00:01] sense that we're not worried about it
[1:00:03] and we probably should have never been
[1:00:04] to be we shouldn't have been to begin
[1:00:05] with I have caught maybe a personal
[1:00:08] revelation about what the 19 is in kovat
[1:00:10] 19 its the 19 pounds I gained and I'm
[1:00:15] just thanking God they didn't name it
[1:00:16] the Cova 30 but and I share this knowing
[1:00:24] that no doubt that these things have
[1:00:25] been ministered on because it was
[1:00:27] necessary for ministry to address these
[1:00:30] things that were taking place at the
[1:00:32] time they're in March and April and even
[1:00:33] into May with these things but there
[1:00:36] were different ones who took this
[1:00:37] attitude based upon certain things that
[1:00:38] brother banner had said that if you have
[1:00:40] the Holy Ghost don't worry about getting
[1:00:42] coronavirus and it might have been the
[1:00:45] intent of it might have been to create a
[1:00:47] faith to say hey don't worry bride
[1:00:49] you're gonna be okay brother BAM said
[1:00:50] those with the Holy Ghost don't have to
[1:00:52] worry about these diseases coming but
[1:00:54] you realize what you have done is you've
[1:00:56] arbitrarily and humanistically created a
[1:00:59] false evidence of the Holy Ghost and in
[1:01:02] doing so you only weaken the faith of a
[1:01:04] genuine sealed believer because now
[1:01:06] they're presented with another evidence
[1:01:08] that will actually confirm whether or
[1:01:10] not they have it so instead of being
[1:01:12] certain according to the word by faith
[1:01:14] that they have it because they've
[1:01:15] received the word for their day and are
[1:01:17] walking in it now it's like well now the
[1:01:19] real test is coming and it's gonna be
[1:01:21] proven by a you know cotton swab being
[1:01:24] shoved up your nose or an antibody test
[1:01:26] no there was there is no truth to that
[1:01:29] thought that those with the Holy Ghost
[1:01:30] will not get coronavirus because that
[1:01:33] becomes another evidence of the Holy
[1:01:35] Ghost and we only have one evidence of
[1:01:38] the Holy Ghost
[1:01:39] there is one disease that the bride is
[1:01:42] among mune - spiritual death she is
[1:01:45] immune to deception she's immune to
[1:01:48] being deceived that's the disease that
[1:01:50] has fallen upon all the world that the
[1:01:52] bride is immune to alone that's the last
[1:01:54] plague that hits the earth that proves
[1:01:57] between electone Ani lek that the world
[1:01:59] would know that I the LORD have put a
[1:02:01] difference between the bride laodicea
[1:02:04] she will not be to see now ever I have a
[1:02:13] lengthy quote to be a part of this
[1:02:14] lengthy sermon but you all are pulling
[1:02:17] so well today my my goodness if if we
[1:02:20] were if we were just if we were digging
[1:02:23] rardy just really really deep here and
[1:02:26] so once you get halfway you just got to
[1:02:28] go all the way all the way through to
[1:02:30] the other side in Satan's Ino try to
[1:02:33] read this quickly it's lengthy but
[1:02:35] follow how brother branham attracting
[1:02:36] this I heard brother Neville say this
[1:02:38] morning someone might have been asking
[1:02:40] him why I didn't preach on the Holy
[1:02:41] Ghost why didn't I do this here it is
[1:02:44] now based upon what he says here and I'm
[1:02:46] just inject I don't like maybe I don't
[1:02:49] like to express my own thoughts but let
[1:02:52] me share it for myself personally and
[1:02:53] you can allow the Lord to deal with you
[1:02:55] but as I read this you realize there had
[1:02:58] to be some impression in the person's
[1:03:00] mind about what the Holy Ghost would
[1:03:03] look like and why brother Branham wasn't
[1:03:05] preaching on it and as he answers that
[1:03:07] you realize that they probably were
[1:03:09] coming from the viewpoint of why don't
[1:03:11] we see more manifestations of gifts why
[1:03:14] don't we see more enthusiasm why don't
[1:03:15] we see more excitement I mean brother
[1:03:17] Branham when he preaches he never has to
[1:03:19] tell the people to be seated
[1:03:21] but brother Browns preaching it's not a
[1:03:23] bunch of shouting going crazy and people
[1:03:25] running on his prayer lines are not not
[1:03:28] the way that they were thinking they
[1:03:30] should be the way these other
[1:03:31] charismatic guys were doing them and
[1:03:33] brother Craig Brewer pointed out to me
[1:03:35] one time he said brother Aaron it
[1:03:36] strikes me I hope he's okay with me
[1:03:38] sharing this and he said it just strikes
[1:03:40] me we don't do our prayer lines like
[1:03:42] brother Branham did him the reverence
[1:03:45] that was there and the faith that was
[1:03:47] evident and he was just expressing this
[1:03:49] from his heart and I imagine that in
[1:03:51] some ways that was kind of what brother
[1:03:52] Brad
[1:03:53] was being asked about is hey how come
[1:03:55] there's not just more of these
[1:03:56] manifestations and brother ban says here
[1:03:59] it is the holy ghost is the action in
[1:04:02] you it's a life not an emotion and
[1:04:05] that's why I feel that brother Branham
[1:04:07] this question was asked to brother
[1:04:08] Brandon why don't you preach preach on
[1:04:10] the Holy Ghost they were looking for
[1:04:11] emotions in the outside realm and
[1:04:14] brother BAE I'm saying it's not an
[1:04:15] emotion it's an action in you not some
[1:04:18] sort of fleshly evidence but it is a
[1:04:20] person Jesus Christ the word established
[1:04:24] in your heart to quicken every word of
[1:04:27] this age Amen I want to know what the
[1:04:30] word is for this age now I think we I
[1:04:32] want all the word but I definitely want
[1:04:35] all the word for this age that's because
[1:04:37] what's promised for this age that maybe
[1:04:39] other ages didn't have I want you to be
[1:04:42] cooking for this age he says right watch
[1:04:43] the Holy Ghost in action not so much in
[1:04:46] demonstrations outward emotions outward
[1:04:49] expressions but in action what it does
[1:04:52] according to the word so it's what it
[1:04:56] does according to the word that's the
[1:04:57] Holy Ghost in action so we look at the
[1:04:59] word and the word says it then we
[1:05:01] believe it and then we want the word
[1:05:02] made manifest
[1:05:03] not so much in things that may be
[1:05:06] expressive or demonstrative but what it
[1:05:08] does according to the word and then he
[1:05:11] backs up to show in addressing this why
[1:05:15] does it brother been a preach on the
[1:05:16] Holy on the Holy Ghost and as he
[1:05:19] expresses this he says now notice the
[1:05:21] Holy Spirit of God's holy word had a man
[1:05:24] and a woman naked and didn't know it how
[1:05:27] beautiful life of the word the seed the
[1:05:28] word God said there's a tree in the
[1:05:30] midst of the garden the woman in the
[1:05:32] midst of the garden is this tree don't
[1:05:34] haven't even touch it
[1:05:35] for the day you eat thereof that day you
[1:05:37] died they were wholly veiled from him
[1:05:41] didn't know nothing about it
[1:05:42] darris to touch it they were wholly
[1:05:44] veiled they were safe in god's pavilion
[1:05:47] they were alive i had somebody tell me
[1:05:51] one time they said they were they were
[1:05:53] they said now god's always been high hid
[1:05:56] behind a hole lavell I said thank God
[1:06:01] he's been unveiled in this hour
[1:06:04] he said they were alive died had no
[1:06:06] death around them hallelujah they had
[1:06:08] perfect love for it the other perfect
[1:06:10] life forever
[1:06:11] they had perfect love perfect
[1:06:13] understanding of the love of God they
[1:06:16] had God's Word and kept it they were
[1:06:18] alive and safe in God's Eden with no
[1:06:21] death at all all around them then Satan
[1:06:24] got Eve to listen to his gospel of
[1:06:27] theology the gospel of knowledge higher
[1:06:29] school in higher ethics better
[1:06:31] civilization higher education and so
[1:06:33] forth then he got her to stop and listen
[1:06:36] to him a minute to his reasonings now
[1:06:41] brother branham is trying to identify
[1:06:43] that this was the basis this was the
[1:06:47] basis for her acting and heard and in
[1:06:52] responding it was it was through
[1:06:54] reasonings that caused her to act it was
[1:06:56] reasoning that caused her to disbelieve
[1:06:58] and he's giving us this example by
[1:07:01] introducing it with this question why
[1:07:03] doesn't brother Branham preach the Holy
[1:07:05] Ghost why didn't I do this why don't I
[1:07:07] do that and he says because it's not
[1:07:09] emotion so they're looking for emotion
[1:07:12] Brother Bear says it's not emotion it's
[1:07:14] the word and then he says in the
[1:07:15] beginning Satan used reasoning and
[1:07:18] intellect to deceive Eve so he's
[1:07:20] connecting emotions with intellect he
[1:07:25] says which we are he says he got her to
[1:07:28] stop a minute to listen to him to his
[1:07:29] reasonings and so the reasonings appeals
[1:07:32] to the flesh something that feels good
[1:07:34] to the flesh it seems reasonable it's
[1:07:37] something that the flesh a sense to so
[1:07:39] it's good there's going to be some
[1:07:40] Accord or satisfaction within your flesh
[1:07:43] that that makes you think that makes
[1:07:46] sense so if there's some dissonance if
[1:07:47] there's some disagreement if there's
[1:07:49] some way that your spirit wouldn't agree
[1:07:51] with it then it's not reasonable but
[1:07:53] through reasons it can actually cause
[1:07:55] even your emotions and your human
[1:07:56] emotions to accept what's being said and
[1:07:59] it's not faith it's all built in an
[1:08:01] emotional realm so it talks about
[1:08:05] reasoning don't divorce that from your
[1:08:07] emotions because some people can be very
[1:08:09] staid very stoic very reasonable very
[1:08:12] logical and their approach to things and
[1:08:14] that's not so much being emotional
[1:08:16] but rather they're using this knowledge
[1:08:18] or logic to bring their motions and
[1:08:21] subject to their reasoning but then
[1:08:23] somebody who has no logic they might
[1:08:25] just react in passion and they react
[1:08:27] just how they're feeling and want to do
[1:08:29] things and it may be a little bit
[1:08:30] chaotic but they're both exist within
[1:08:32] the same intellectual human spirit realm
[1:08:36] when he got her to listen he says now
[1:08:38] looky here the church is so-and-so it's
[1:08:40] been established for so long we're one
[1:08:42] of the oldest churches in the country
[1:08:44] brother Branham just certainly Satan
[1:08:47] didn't say that then right but he's the
[1:08:51] same old devil now in this age saying
[1:08:53] this very thing he says he's saying
[1:08:56] though oldest churches in the country
[1:08:58] the mayor the city goes he goes I don't
[1:08:59] care what it is if it's against God's
[1:09:02] Word be against it that's your enemy
[1:09:06] anything that against the word is your
[1:09:09] enemy
[1:09:10] everything that's for the word is your
[1:09:13] brother and we can get real legalistic
[1:09:16] on this and say if they deny the word
[1:09:17] they're not your brother but the Bible
[1:09:20] says love your enemies do good to those
[1:09:22] who who hates you despitefully use you
[1:09:24] so they shouldn't be able to tell the
[1:09:26] difference so it doesn't change how we
[1:09:28] treat them it just changes our
[1:09:29] understanding so everything that's for
[1:09:32] the word is your brother he's a part of
[1:09:33] you notice he pulled off the holy veil
[1:09:35] to see what sex really was compare that
[1:09:38] what lust really would do so now the
[1:09:41] results of this intellectual reasoning
[1:09:43] is now being expressed in a physical
[1:09:45] realm and feelings and sensations so
[1:09:48] he's just walking us right through this
[1:09:49] process she pulled the veil from off her
[1:09:51] eyes and that the holy thing that God
[1:09:54] had put over her eyes she wanted
[1:09:56] knowledge to know what it was all about
[1:09:57] so he pulled the veil off to see what it
[1:10:00] was all about she listened to the devil
[1:10:01] and noticed what a place it put her in
[1:10:04] because now through intellect there's
[1:10:06] passion there's excitement there's
[1:10:07] there's feeling there's emotion there's
[1:10:09] sensation
[1:10:10] he says she listened to the devil and
[1:10:12] notice what a place that put her in
[1:10:14] they'll they have done the same in each
[1:10:16] age thereafter always taking the
[1:10:19] intellectual side and has now built a
[1:10:22] kingdom of Satan knowledge his seed that
[1:10:24] he sowed and has took the world to be an
[1:10:26] Eden of death
[1:10:29] the intellectual side always appeals to
[1:10:32] human emotions regardless of how it
[1:10:34] might express itself it is rooted in
[1:10:37] human emotion therefore it can be
[1:10:39] subject to human passion to lust to
[1:10:42] perversion it can be subject to feelings
[1:10:44] of it can actually be subject to to a
[1:10:47] lack of emotion and hardness and
[1:10:49] rigidity and a formalism but reasoning
[1:10:55] lead to lust because it's rooted in the
[1:10:57] flesh and often intellectual faith is
[1:11:01] viewed as being without emotion viewed
[1:11:03] as being dry and having no outward
[1:11:05] expression but that's not true the
[1:11:08] intellectual side has a cult has a has a
[1:11:11] cold formal confession in one sense but
[1:11:14] also emotional sensations in another it
[1:11:18] has it can be called informal it can
[1:11:20] also be a energetic and exciting and
[1:11:23] emotional but neither way is right in
[1:11:26] the channel or can be outside the
[1:11:29] channel but mmm says and I have heard
[1:11:31] but now I see says no selfish thing will
[1:11:33] work your motive and objective has to be
[1:11:35] exactly perfectly right then you have
[1:11:37] faith to ask if our hearts condemn us
[1:11:40] not then we have confidence see we've
[1:11:42] got to have confidence I want this to be
[1:11:45] the honor and glory of God then faith
[1:11:48] has a channel to move into he says if it
[1:11:51] doesn't then you've got mental
[1:11:52] intellectual faith in not genuine faith
[1:11:56] from God the that intellectual faith
[1:11:59] will get you nowhere now we can and we
[1:12:03] can rightly teach the intellectual faith
[1:12:07] it is reserved that it doesn't move it
[1:12:11] uh it's formal it doesn't have life
[1:12:14] it'll never lead you to a birth and it
[1:12:16] can be characterized like maybe in a
[1:12:18] sense like the Baptist you know they
[1:12:20] just believe and that's it and there's
[1:12:21] no there's nothing that follows and
[1:12:23] you're right you can be right to deduce
[1:12:25] that in and and the word could discern
[1:12:28] that in and correctly give the diagnosis
[1:12:30] that's the problem
[1:12:32] but brother Branham is going to show
[1:12:33] that how this relationship works he's
[1:12:36] saying that you want to have faith and
[1:12:37] you want faith to move into this right
[1:12:39] channel where you're more
[1:12:40] of an objective is right he says he says
[1:12:42] if you got mental intellectual faith and
[1:12:44] not genuine faith it'll get you nowhere
[1:12:46] then he says it might get you emotional
[1:12:50] but it won't get you the healing that
[1:12:52] you're looking for so intellectual faith
[1:12:55] can bring emotions it can bring
[1:12:58] enthusiasm it can bring sensations but
[1:13:01] it won't bring you the feeling and
[1:13:05] that's that's brother branham connecting
[1:13:06] now this intellectual faith in this
[1:13:09] mental faith with emotional faith and
[1:13:12] God keeps his word he says now just a
[1:13:14] moment everyone be reverent don't move
[1:13:16] stand still pray with all your heart
[1:13:18] this is very you know he's trying to get
[1:13:21] the people revered to let the angel of
[1:13:22] the Lord come and there could be
[1:13:24] manifestations of healing he says don't
[1:13:27] be emotionally have faith so don't be
[1:13:31] emotional have faith your emotions will
[1:13:34] never build and and if I could finish
[1:13:37] the sentence form if I could fill in the
[1:13:39] blank I would say your motions will
[1:13:40] never build the right kind of faith that
[1:13:42] your emotions will never build you to a
[1:13:44] place of healing it'll never build
[1:13:46] confidence to receive your healing he
[1:13:48] says it'll build a material intellectual
[1:13:50] faith but it'll never build faith in
[1:13:53] your heart so says your emotions will
[1:13:55] never build faith in your heart but
[1:13:57] emotions can build intellectual faith in
[1:14:00] your mind emotions could do them so in
[1:14:03] one hand he's saying that intellectual
[1:14:05] faith might get you emotional now he's
[1:14:08] saying emotional motions can get you
[1:14:10] intellectual faith he says it'll never
[1:14:12] build faith in your heart let the words
[1:14:14] sink down just believe God if you can
[1:14:16] believe all things are possible so
[1:14:19] emotions build intellectual faith
[1:14:21] because you're placing your confidence
[1:14:23] in your emotions or your emotional
[1:14:26] expression he say well I feel good that
[1:14:28] I must have it I feel good so something
[1:14:30] must be happening and there could be
[1:14:32] this thought of uh well I'm placed in my
[1:14:34] confidence in the fact that things are
[1:14:36] feeling different or you're placing your
[1:14:38] confidence in some outburst or
[1:14:40] expression and all too many times and
[1:14:42] far too many times there's been people
[1:14:45] experienced I'm sort of refreshing and
[1:14:47] reviving as the Holy Spirit is being
[1:14:49] poured out and they feel this expression
[1:14:51] and they blow out
[1:14:52] all the steam and it makes them feel
[1:14:54] really good but they stop there and
[1:14:57] never go on to a birth and I feel well
[1:15:01] what how could you explain being slain
[1:15:03] in the spirit
[1:15:04] how could you explain running around how
[1:15:06] could you explain this how could you
[1:15:07] explain that so well that was the
[1:15:08] outpouring of the Holy Ghost my goodness
[1:15:12] let's be careful that when the when
[1:15:13] something's moving that we don't just
[1:15:15] always say well that was just some sort
[1:15:16] of a carnal that was just the Antichrist
[1:15:19] a devilish spirit moving through no God
[1:15:22] God pours out his spirit upon all flesh
[1:15:24] and so there's a there's a rejoicing
[1:15:27] there's praise there's shoutings and
[1:15:29] people get caught up in it and then they
[1:15:31] go outside that realm like man I felt
[1:15:33] like I had the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:34] brother man says yeah you can have every
[1:15:36] day of your life and still be lost and
[1:15:38] go to hell because you're saying this
[1:15:42] emotion it doesn't build the right kind
[1:15:44] of faith because it obscures things that
[1:15:47] deviates you and some of you just taking
[1:15:49] him at his word that the devil can
[1:15:52] pervert for every fruit of the Spirit
[1:15:54] the devil has a perversion of it that
[1:15:57] can be a negative perversion with
[1:15:59] gentleness which is being the ability to
[1:16:02] rejoice when someone else is blessed you
[1:16:05] could have it you can have jealousy and
[1:16:08] then so the devil can pervert those
[1:16:10] emotions but then he can also
[1:16:11] impersonate any fruit of the Spirit now
[1:16:17] would you be able to say amen to that
[1:16:18] raise your hand that that's brother
[1:16:19] Branham that teaches out the devil can
[1:16:22] impersonate every single one of the
[1:16:24] fruits of the spirit I'm so emotions
[1:16:28] only build an intellectual faith an
[1:16:30] intellectual faith can only build
[1:16:32] emotions but genuine faith is in the
[1:16:34] word and by the word genuine faith is
[1:16:37] connected with the word and the word
[1:16:39] builds faith faith cometh by hearing and
[1:16:41] hearing by the Word of God Paul writes
[1:16:43] in Romans 10:17 faith genuine faith
[1:16:46] comes by hearing and hearing by the Word
[1:16:48] of God brother man says faith is not
[1:16:50] mythical something mentally worked up
[1:16:52] it's an absolutely fundamental result
[1:16:55] that happens in a person's heart when
[1:16:57] faith is appropriated then it's
[1:16:58] something in the person's heart but it
[1:17:01] can't be based on say well go touch a
[1:17:04] tree and you'll get well pray to the PO
[1:17:07] he says it's got to have a foundation
[1:17:08] now here it is I want you to get it how
[1:17:11] much more foundation could you place
[1:17:12] your faith on any level than the Word of
[1:17:15] God what more could you put faith in
[1:17:17] faiths final resting place is on the
[1:17:20] Word of God we realize without faith it
[1:17:23] is impossible to please God for he that
[1:17:25] cometh to God must first believe that he
[1:17:27] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[1:17:30] that diligently seek Him
[1:17:31] so if you want to seek God you have to
[1:17:33] do it by faith if you're gonna find them
[1:17:35] and when you find them you have to also
[1:17:37] believe you'll be rewarded by him and
[1:17:39] all of that happens by faith apart from
[1:17:41] any other evidence you can't say God I
[1:17:46] believe you'll bless me when you bless
[1:17:48] me I'm gonna believe that it's so when
[1:17:51] it's so no that's why when they say
[1:17:53] seeing is believing well that's the
[1:17:55] intellectual side that's the carnal side
[1:17:57] but faith is actually an evidence of the
[1:18:00] unseen and that's where God is wanting
[1:18:03] to bring his bride in this last days is
[1:18:05] to believe him absolutely apart from
[1:18:08] sight apart from sensation apart from
[1:18:10] anything fleshly or carnal generalize
[1:18:13] that to the Jews he had to reveal
[1:18:14] himself in flesh as a physical Messiah
[1:18:17] but to the bride it's not a physical
[1:18:19] union but an invisible union and that
[1:18:21] the Gentile bride receives a messiah
[1:18:24] absolutely and totally by faith without
[1:18:27] sight without hands touching flesh and
[1:18:29] she doesn't doubt it and she's actually
[1:18:32] telling people that she's been invisibly
[1:18:35] United with the present Jesus Christ
[1:18:37] without seeing thorn Prince without
[1:18:39] seeing nail scars but she believes the
[1:18:42] revelation of the Son of Man has United
[1:18:44] the word to the bride in this hour
[1:18:47] [Applause]
[1:18:49] that's the bride's faith that's what he
[1:18:52] wants us to walk in and so faith is not
[1:18:56] mythical it's something not mentally
[1:18:59] worked up it's absolutely a fundamental
[1:19:00] result in a person's heart faith is an
[1:19:03] evidence let me encourage you today if
[1:19:06] you have any fear in your heart just
[1:19:08] know this fear is no evidence that's
[1:19:12] where faith fear lies to you you give in
[1:19:14] to the fear your fear can create
[1:19:17] it'll bring the thing bring the very
[1:19:19] thing you're fearing and the only reason
[1:19:21] why it does that now just bear with me
[1:19:23] as you ponder this the only reason why
[1:19:26] it does that is because you let your
[1:19:27] faith operate it how else can fear how
[1:19:32] else can the very thing job fear come
[1:19:35] upon him unless job took this righteous
[1:19:37] faith and placed it on the wrong thing
[1:19:43] and when we miss appropriate our faith
[1:19:45] and we put it on the wrong thing it can
[1:19:47] actually bring materialize the things
[1:19:48] that we fear but not because fear has
[1:19:50] that kind of power but because your
[1:19:52] faith isn't placed right fear is no
[1:19:55] evidence if you're believing for your
[1:19:56] healing today and your symptoms have you
[1:19:59] worried look at your symptoms and say I
[1:20:01] may be worried I may be scared but let
[1:20:03] me tell you something you're no evidence
[1:20:05] of unbel unbelief because I believe lord
[1:20:08] I believe help my unbelief your no
[1:20:10] evidence that I'm not going to be healed
[1:20:12] your no evidence that I'm gonna be a
[1:20:13] failure your no evidence that God's Word
[1:20:15] isn't true my fear is no evidence even
[1:20:19] though I may acknowledge it I'm bringing
[1:20:21] it subject to the promise and say fear
[1:20:25] you may be real but you're not greater
[1:20:28] than the power of God inside of it
[1:20:29] you're not greater than he who's given
[1:20:32] the promise so you could take this
[1:20:36] principle of faith being connected with
[1:20:38] the word and I now express this and
[1:20:41] believe it was when the Lord dealt with
[1:20:43] my heart about fear that this whole
[1:20:44] subject opened up to me then I was I was
[1:20:48] amazed at how powerful fear was and I
[1:20:50] realized that we can feed our fears and
[1:20:55] just listen just by looking at the Cova
[1:20:58] 19 graphs and tweets that go out and
[1:21:01] browsing Reddit and all these social
[1:21:03] media thing listen I think Facebook's
[1:21:04] done more to feed fear than it has been
[1:21:06] to connect us with their classmates in
[1:21:08] our and our colleagues in our family
[1:21:10] because the things we read the things
[1:21:12] were digesting you wonder why you're
[1:21:14] nervous you wonder why you're scared you
[1:21:15] wonder why you're tore up mentally and
[1:21:17] you wonder why some of the health things
[1:21:19] that we succumb to it's because what our
[1:21:21] emotions are being battered by all these
[1:21:23] things we're feeding on the things in
[1:21:25] the world we'll build a fear it grows
[1:21:27] increases your fear the
[1:21:28] the word increases your faith change
[1:21:30] your diet and things will change and so
[1:21:41] we must feed our faith and you can apply
[1:21:43] this principle to anything you can do it
[1:21:44] to salvation acts 2:38 put your faith
[1:21:47] right on that you can do it to healing
[1:21:50] by His stripes I'm healed appropriate
[1:21:52] your faith just Isaiah 53 you can do it
[1:21:55] by healing to look at the James chapter
[1:21:56] 5 the prayer of faith
[1:21:58] Colio is the prayer faith shall save the
[1:21:59] sick you're placing it on the word yeah
[1:22:04] you're not even you're not even thinking
[1:22:05] well my who could I have pray for him if
[1:22:07] we could just get brother Qadri here and
[1:22:09] he can lay hands on me her brother
[1:22:11] jeweller
[1:22:11] oh my brother Jason do you think you
[1:22:13] could get brother Ron Spencer here the
[1:22:15] God is honored his faithfulness and his
[1:22:17] gift and the dynamic power that's
[1:22:19] followed and can you bring him here so
[1:22:21] that I can receive a healing just like
[1:22:23] he did when she he laid his hands on her
[1:22:25] when he did this for them and all these
[1:22:27] great things and you notice your faith
[1:22:28] is on the things that have been done and
[1:22:30] not the promise that did it and you want
[1:22:35] you want a dynamic man of God like
[1:22:37] brother Qadri to come to lay hands on
[1:22:39] you but if you've taken your faith and
[1:22:41] you've based upon an instance where a
[1:22:43] person was healed by his hands that have
[1:22:45] you caught the revelation that he was
[1:22:47] only doing it according to the word and
[1:22:49] that's what will do it for you brother
[1:22:52] Branham preached the meeting I believe
[1:22:54] it was in Kansas and there was a man who
[1:22:55] had been crushed by her in an accident
[1:22:57] he said all God would just give me a
[1:22:59] vision to go lay hands on him he'd come
[1:23:01] out of that hospital and be well and the
[1:23:02] Lord spoke to him said the same faith
[1:23:04] that you put in that vision to lay your
[1:23:06] hands on him is the same faith you use
[1:23:08] when you lay your hands on them without
[1:23:10] a vision and that's the place that God
[1:23:13] wants his bride to walk in not where we
[1:23:16] need the vision not where we need the
[1:23:18] sensation not where we need the Builder
[1:23:20] but God said it that settles it
[1:23:23] [Applause]
[1:23:26] and we direct our faith to the word take
[1:23:29] God at His Word don't reason it out I
[1:23:35] believe God's my healer while you were
[1:23:37] in the kitchen I by His stripes I'm here
[1:23:41] when it's been don't don't want to hear
[1:23:44] it no matter what they say well you
[1:23:48] realize this runs in your family
[1:23:50] yeah that's why that's why I needed a
[1:23:53] new birth genetics doesn't have the
[1:23:57] final say
[1:23:59] family history doesn't have the final
[1:24:01] say listen can we just settle the
[1:24:03] argument death doesn't even have the
[1:24:05] final say why because a blind man could
[1:24:10] testify and say hey man I was blind and
[1:24:13] I got healed I really encourage you and
[1:24:16] in another person you say well I was
[1:24:18] lame and now I could walk and and all
[1:24:20] these different people could testify but
[1:24:21] then they could actually look at the
[1:24:23] situation in your zit and I don't know
[1:24:24] that's a rough one how long have you had
[1:24:27] it how difficult is it - it looks too
[1:24:29] bad and I'm just so glad that brother
[1:24:32] Rodney Griffin wrote the song for
[1:24:33] greater vision said that Lazarus stepped
[1:24:35] forward and said excuse me a moment
[1:24:36] can I testify you just take comfort from
[1:24:40] Lazarus testimony listen no matter how
[1:24:42] far gone you think it is no matter how
[1:24:45] far out there your children are no
[1:24:47] matter how broken your marriage is no
[1:24:48] matter how bad your finances are no
[1:24:50] matter how bleak the situation looks let
[1:24:53] Lazarus
[1:24:54] testify there's no situation too far
[1:24:57] gone for this my faith in God's Word
[1:24:59] take God at His Word believe them for
[1:25:03] the impossible now I want to just go
[1:25:10] further than this I'm having a good time
[1:25:13] is it alright if you're just here for my
[1:25:16] fun my goodness I'm enjoying myself if
[1:25:25] we if we begin just to dissect this
[1:25:27] further there's a difference between
[1:25:30] being rational and rationalizing and so
[1:25:35] when we don't reason it out
[1:25:37] that doesn't mean we don't have some
[1:25:39] reason and that we have a godly
[1:25:42] reasoning that we have we have something
[1:25:44] in our minds that is a that is aligned
[1:25:46] with reason because there's a what we
[1:25:48] acted in faith may seem unreasonable to
[1:25:50] the world but it seems absolutely
[1:25:52] reasonable to us as Christians so we're
[1:25:55] not operating without reason we're not
[1:25:57] app operating without an understanding
[1:25:59] and so we're not being we're not
[1:26:02] rationalizing babari being rational
[1:26:04] according to the word we're being a if
[1:26:07] it's scriptural logic so to speak it's a
[1:26:09] it's a godly reasoning and so we want to
[1:26:12] approach the word rationally we don't
[1:26:15] need to amend it with our emotions we
[1:26:19] don't need to supplement it when God
[1:26:22] says if we believe this Bible to be true
[1:26:26] and we were convinced of it if God for
[1:26:29] some reason aloud allowed the bride to
[1:26:32] go a stretch let's just say we're just
[1:26:34] being we're just hypothetically speaking
[1:26:36] if we allowed the entire body of Christ
[1:26:39] to go ten years without one miracle it
[1:26:42] wouldn't change the truth and so God's
[1:26:47] Word can be believed without evidence
[1:26:49] God's Word can be believed without
[1:26:51] substance up lament but thank God he's
[1:26:55] given us precedent he hasn't left us
[1:26:58] without precedent but the precedent is
[1:27:01] connected with the word when a brother
[1:27:03] testifies God's done this and someone
[1:27:05] else testifies God than that that gives
[1:27:07] you faith to believe that that word that
[1:27:10] God confirms his word he backs it up but
[1:27:12] I could say we're in the absence of
[1:27:14] precedent our faith can believe God's
[1:27:17] Word absolutely because we approached it
[1:27:21] rationally in understanding God said it
[1:27:25] better BAM says in question and answers
[1:27:28] in August of 64 he says what's the use
[1:27:29] of jumping up and down and shouting and
[1:27:31] speaking in tongues if you don't know
[1:27:33] what it's all about he says you got to
[1:27:35] understand why you were there yeah
[1:27:37] there's got to be understanding to it he
[1:27:41] says you can't headlong long plunge into
[1:27:43] something that you when you don't know
[1:27:44] where you're going you've got to know by
[1:27:47] faith now he's in this prayer
[1:27:51] he's telling a story about a woman when
[1:27:53] he came to pray for her he says sister
[1:27:55] do you remember me and she was trying to
[1:27:56] open her eyes she said who is it I said
[1:27:59] brother branham and watch this she says
[1:28:01] and she started crying tears swollen
[1:28:03] face young woman about twenty-two old
[1:28:05] brother branham shake my hand shake my
[1:28:07] hand
[1:28:07] hey sis now just don't be hysterical
[1:28:09] sister
[1:28:10] I took a hold of her hand I said I come
[1:28:13] to have prayer she said oh and I said
[1:28:16] now be quiet be quiet don't get all
[1:28:19] emotional wait till God heals you and
[1:28:23] then get emotional he says and so I said
[1:28:29] come solid saintly listen to me now
[1:28:34] here's a sister that needed healing and
[1:28:36] she's getting hysterical she's getting
[1:28:38] emotional she's getting worked up and
[1:28:40] brother Bannon realizes that won't that
[1:28:42] won't bring faith if you pondered this
[1:28:45] that brother Branham said there was
[1:28:46] people that were healed at Beatles
[1:28:48] concerts then the the mechanics of that
[1:28:53] and even to accept the dynamic it is in
[1:28:56] an emotional realm in an excitement even
[1:29:00] a misappropriation of confidence or
[1:29:02] belief and it produces he's the one that
[1:29:05] indicates it that there's some
[1:29:07] expression of deliverance or healing in
[1:29:09] that in that setting not I mean maybe I
[1:29:13] mentioned it in a where it it deserves a
[1:29:16] sunday-school so you might have to come
[1:29:18] back and clean up my mess I'm just kind
[1:29:20] of just throwing it out there like hey
[1:29:22] what do you think about that we'll see
[1:29:23] you guys later it causes you to wonder
[1:29:26] why that's that's that's amazing and
[1:29:29] brother man who realizes now you can get
[1:29:31] all worked up may feel better but that
[1:29:33] won't bring a permanent healing because
[1:29:35] soon as you lose that enthusiasm what
[1:29:37] happens you just be sick again so he
[1:29:40] says you got to come sane sane ly
[1:29:42] solidly you got to listen to the word so
[1:29:46] there has to be some sense there should
[1:29:48] be a sub sameness that has to be the
[1:29:50] emotions have to be brought in a line
[1:29:52] there has to be some harmony emotional
[1:29:54] harmony so that you're not leaning to
[1:29:56] any extreme and there's a balance for
[1:29:59] that moment for you to accept the Word
[1:30:01] of God take him at his word
[1:30:03] that's exactly what the word preach does
[1:30:05] it aligns our spirits with the word it
[1:30:09] brings our emotions under subjection to
[1:30:11] the word for our faith to operate
[1:30:14] preaching is not meant to whip us into a
[1:30:16] frenzy preaching is not meant to get us
[1:30:20] all worked up through emotionalism but
[1:30:22] it stood it's to tie us to distr sup
[1:30:25] deeply within our souls for something
[1:30:27] within your soul to rise up say I take
[1:30:29] God at His Word
[1:30:30] I believe him for his word and there's a
[1:30:33] way that the word could the gospel can
[1:30:35] be presented where it is at the on the
[1:30:38] majority stirring you up and the
[1:30:40] majority of people are being stirred up
[1:30:42] emotionally but yet if the word is
[1:30:44] coming behind it and in that channel
[1:30:46] things that may be working only
[1:30:48] emotional on some people can actually be
[1:30:51] received deeply in the soul of another
[1:30:53] and you can have a whole church that's
[1:30:55] slain in the spirit and then just a real
[1:30:57] quiet sister back there being delivered
[1:31:00] of cancer because you just say thank you
[1:31:02] thank you because the word drops down
[1:31:06] into that channel and so the preacher of
[1:31:09] the word is not to get us worked up
[1:31:10] emotionally but to bring our emotions
[1:31:12] subject to the word and again I'm on a
[1:31:16] call back to what I said in the
[1:31:17] beginning I'm in no way preaching
[1:31:19] against emotions we are emotional beings
[1:31:21] and the Word of God the Word of God be
[1:31:23] in the scripture and the message
[1:31:25] recognize that and identify that and do
[1:31:27] not try to strip emotions from our
[1:31:29] experience and and do not strip the word
[1:31:31] from dealing with our emotions as a
[1:31:33] matter of fact in my heart I see the
[1:31:36] majority of the Word of God being
[1:31:39] directed towards the born-again believer
[1:31:41] so that their character can be perfected
[1:31:44] and their spirits may be perfected in
[1:31:46] order to match the perfect body because
[1:31:48] it's a God who hath redeemed our souls
[1:31:50] and will one day redeem our bodies and
[1:31:52] is right now redeeming our spirits and
[1:31:55] so so much of the word is aligning our
[1:31:58] thoughts and our affections and teaching
[1:32:00] us how to treat our wives teaching us to
[1:32:02] not be harsh towards our children it all
[1:32:04] deals in an emotional realm so I'm not
[1:32:06] disregarding emotions at all as a matter
[1:32:08] of fact I'm trying to say that our
[1:32:10] attitude for so long that basically said
[1:32:13] well if you've got a problem just you
[1:32:14] just need the Holy Ghost
[1:32:16] time's misses the point that yes you
[1:32:18] need the Holy Ghost but the word needs
[1:32:20] to deal with our emotions first so he
[1:32:22] can get the Holy Ghost
[1:32:25] could you imagine telling an adult who
[1:32:31] struggled and struggled and struggled
[1:32:32] and knows they need the Holy Ghost and
[1:32:34] tells you they got this problem that
[1:32:35] problem and they come to brother Jason
[1:32:37] Jason III you're the assistant pastor
[1:32:40] but I know the pastor speaks to you but
[1:32:42] I gotta just ask you and I've got this
[1:32:44] problem and that problem my lifestyle
[1:32:46] this my life's done that and buddy she
[1:32:47] just goes well you just need the holy
[1:32:49] guys you know what the person probably
[1:32:54] say I know that you know I know that I
[1:32:59] don't know what it is though that's
[1:33:01] keeping me from it what is the Holy
[1:33:04] Spirit do it can go right down in there
[1:33:05] and find to get that person in that
[1:33:08] right state of mind when they have that
[1:33:12] clarity what a brother man talk about
[1:33:13] that one sister now when you see she
[1:33:15] said oh and she heard mine came back to
[1:33:18] her he said right now sister look to
[1:33:20] Calvary right now I you're in your right
[1:33:22] mind look to Calvary what is the
[1:33:25] dynamics of the word putting the person
[1:33:27] in the right emotional state not that
[1:33:29] the right emotional state was the final
[1:33:31] product but putting in her place where
[1:33:33] she could receive the promise and so a
[1:33:36] lot of times we're dealing with people
[1:33:38] and their experience and we're telling
[1:33:39] why you need the Holy Ghost they know
[1:33:41] they need the Holy Ghost but they need
[1:33:42] the word to put them in the right
[1:33:43] emotional state to get the Holy Ghost
[1:33:45] and could you imagine how defeating that
[1:33:47] would be if the assistant pastor told
[1:33:49] this person well brother you just need
[1:33:51] the holding go she says Jason I thought
[1:33:53] I had it I thought I had a new birth
[1:33:56] experience I I don't have any sin in my
[1:33:58] life I that I any repetitive sins or
[1:34:01] habitual sins I love the Lord I've been
[1:34:03] faithful just really struggle with this
[1:34:04] and I've had this problem I got angry at
[1:34:06] work or whatever why you just need the
[1:34:07] holy God and in both instances the words
[1:34:11] not addressing the need this might be an
[1:34:15] adult that needs to let go bitterness it
[1:34:16] might be somebody that's had some route
[1:34:18] to follow them and it did word needs to
[1:34:20] the word needs to take this and deal in
[1:34:21] an emotional realm do some gardening so
[1:34:23] to speak brother branham is telling a
[1:34:28] story it when he preaches a sermon lie
[1:34:29] to 1957 how he visited a world a girl in
[1:34:32] an insane asylum as she was a Christian
[1:34:35] girl if I recall and that she had I
[1:34:37] might even been that her passion her dad
[1:34:38] was a preacher I may be kind of
[1:34:40] amalgamating different things together
[1:34:42] do I put 25 cents in a jar someone told
[1:34:45] me about him when a lawyer uses the big
[1:34:46] word he has to pay throw something in
[1:34:48] the jar so 20 cents cheaper uh and and
[1:34:52] how his brother BAM said that she'd went
[1:34:54] to college and their colleges professor
[1:34:56] had perverted her and she'd gone crazy
[1:34:59] and brother says this now him being a
[1:35:01] psychiatrist he swung the girl's mind
[1:35:04] until now she becomes so evil so bad
[1:35:07] till she didn't even want to hear the
[1:35:08] name of Jesus spoken in her presence and
[1:35:09] even her father mother can't even see
[1:35:11] her no more she had lost her mind and
[1:35:14] this next week we'll go to the
[1:35:16] institution for shock treatment it's
[1:35:18] because that she turned her thoughts
[1:35:20] from Christ
[1:35:22] she turned her thoughts from Christ unto
[1:35:25] what that psychiatrist was moving her
[1:35:28] mind to where was he was moving her mind
[1:35:30] now let's establish this very clearly
[1:35:33] what happened to this young girl is what
[1:35:35] how she was thinking was turned from the
[1:35:38] things of God to a perversion it's swung
[1:35:41] her - she went crazy and he says that
[1:35:43] the psychiatrist swung the girls mind
[1:35:46] so through psychology through what his
[1:35:49] his a discourse they're working on her
[1:35:51] mind he swung her mind from the thoughts
[1:35:55] of Christ to thoughts of the world and
[1:35:57] her and she went insane now we might
[1:36:00] make the mistake then that if she's gone
[1:36:04] crazy in her head then what she needs is
[1:36:08] I need to take this hand and plant it
[1:36:10] firmly on the middle of her forehead and
[1:36:12] rock it back and forth in the name of
[1:36:14] Jesus Christ and shut that nasty devil
[1:36:17] out of her my dad tells the story he'll
[1:36:25] appreciate this he tells the story when
[1:36:27] he first came to the message he wasn't
[1:36:28] Pentecostal and he said the sister was
[1:36:30] coming through the prayer line
[1:36:33] and he said rated blaze this has to
[1:36:35] bless God heal her neck and she went
[1:36:38] straighten right out and he's like
[1:36:39] hallelujah
[1:36:41] now she was he didn't know that was just
[1:36:43] how you how they worship and so in our
[1:36:48] in our minds and our thinking we're
[1:36:50] thinking this devil needs to be cast out
[1:36:51] of her we would think psychology and the
[1:36:54] turning of her mind perverted her so we
[1:36:57] would maybe run the other way listen to
[1:36:59] brother Browns words and that's what we
[1:37:01] are here for this morning is to move
[1:37:04] your mind the devil accomplished the
[1:37:09] perversion in this girl's life by
[1:37:10] swinging her mind and turning her
[1:37:13] thoughts and then brother BAM says I'm
[1:37:15] here to do the same thing today I'm here
[1:37:17] to move your mind I'm here to swing your
[1:37:20] thoughts that's what we're here for this
[1:37:22] morning is to move your mind and your
[1:37:24] thinking from the things of the world
[1:37:26] until the things of God which are
[1:37:28] eternal unto the things of god which are
[1:37:30] eternal and that's what preaching is for
[1:37:32] is to pervert the thinking to a higher
[1:37:36] and better into a place where Christ is
[1:37:39] until you become converted then your
[1:37:42] mind reaches for those things which are
[1:37:44] above my goodness programs in the very
[1:37:47] mechanics and dynamics of preaching is
[1:37:49] that the word is preached so that your
[1:37:51] mind is first turned from worldliness to
[1:37:54] godliness
[1:37:55] it's swain of the mind from bad thoughts
[1:37:58] to pure thoughts so the first thing that
[1:38:00] happens by preaching the word is it lies
[1:38:02] that channel up so the word can get to
[1:38:05] your soul the first thing preaching is
[1:38:09] he says to pervert so it's to change
[1:38:11] preaching and change it from one thing
[1:38:13] to another preaches to revert your
[1:38:15] thinking it's it's not as if you're
[1:38:19] going to sit there in your mind thinking
[1:38:20] there's nothing to this there's nothing
[1:38:21] through this is nothing to this and also
[1:38:22] in your soul goes wow praise the Lord
[1:38:25] the mind descents the mind agrees the
[1:38:29] channel opens up so then your mind
[1:38:32] reaches out so the word deals with our
[1:38:35] emotions it does it to make them subject
[1:38:39] to the word bringing us are in the right
[1:38:40] mind to decide a right time to decide
[1:38:43] that's why when the spirit is moving
[1:38:45] with the word has come forth you find
[1:38:46] yourself in
[1:38:47] places of clarity and peace with God
[1:38:50] it's in that moment that you that you
[1:38:52] want to stand upon faith it's the moment
[1:38:53] you want to make that decision make that
[1:38:55] confession brother Branham says and just
[1:39:00] once more Lord coz this'n we could
[1:39:01] settle for just a cleansing of our
[1:39:03] spirits we can settle for just a washing
[1:39:04] out we can settle just because we see
[1:39:06] crowd Calvary but it's in that moment
[1:39:08] you've got to make the decision even
[1:39:10] when it comes right down to putting what
[1:39:12] you say you believe into practice and
[1:39:14] willing to confess the wrong they don't
[1:39:15] do it it just isn't there they don't
[1:39:17] have it well that's real conviction
[1:39:19] that's what we need we've long left a
[1:39:21] long time ago and swapped in prayer and
[1:39:23] confession and conviction we've swapped
[1:39:25] it for emotion a shaking or a jerking or
[1:39:27] jumping up and down that's the reason
[1:39:30] there is no holding tight because
[1:39:32] there's nothing there to hold them until
[1:39:34] you come upon the basis of God's Word
[1:39:37] now notice not without emotion he says
[1:39:40] of godly sorrow ready to repent so
[1:39:43] that's a feeling that's a readiness of
[1:39:45] mind and make anything right and do
[1:39:47] what's right ready to live so he's
[1:39:50] referring to your intent he's referring
[1:39:51] to your motive and objective he's
[1:39:53] dealing with the person's emotions their
[1:39:55] thoughts and feelings that bring them to
[1:39:56] the right balance in order to go forward
[1:39:58] and their experience with Christ let's
[1:40:01] not settle for that moment when we feel
[1:40:03] better when we feel better that's the
[1:40:06] time to go another step
[1:40:07] maybe we're just always coming to that
[1:40:10] place where we feel better when you feel
[1:40:11] better go forward don't be in the cycle
[1:40:14] of feeling good feeling bad feeling good
[1:40:16] feeling bad take a step higher I feel
[1:40:18] good I want to get gooder I feel good I
[1:40:22] know there's more I don't listen we're
[1:40:25] gonna walk until better becomes best so
[1:40:28] I want to get better I want to get
[1:40:29] better I want to get better until better
[1:40:31] comes becomes best listen once you've
[1:40:33] been sealed into the body of Christ it's
[1:40:35] good getting gooder
[1:40:37] if you're not sealed it's bad getting
[1:40:39] battered listen you either need a new
[1:40:42] birth experience or go forward with it
[1:40:48] says you know I heard some time in a
[1:40:51] meeting here long ago someone said just
[1:40:53] let your mind go blank now he said just
[1:40:57] look right straight up towards the skies
[1:40:59] let your mind go blank you'll get an
[1:41:01] experienced service there's no doubt
[1:41:03] like what you would that's right you get
[1:41:06] an experience but what an experience you
[1:41:09] see when you do that you just open your
[1:41:10] soul to Satan he'll give you something
[1:41:12] that's true but I think a person coming
[1:41:15] to Christ should come with all the
[1:41:18] intelligence they got quoting in their
[1:41:22] mind when they come to him every promise
[1:41:25] in the scripture you're sitting in your
[1:41:28] emotions on crisis you're making the
[1:41:31] word the focal point they says with all
[1:41:33] the intelligence you have quoting the
[1:41:35] promise keep your mind alert when you
[1:41:37] come to Christ don't let it go blank
[1:41:40] the devil will make you do anything
[1:41:43] they'll give you a sensation he can do
[1:41:46] that too but you want an experience
[1:41:48] something that the Bible teaches
[1:41:50] something that's real it's anchored in
[1:41:54] the promise he says you've gotten that
[1:41:56] I'm just gonna start just naming a few
[1:41:57] here he goes
[1:41:58] you've got to come first sanely soundly
[1:42:00] and god's provided way of approach to
[1:42:02] him and in that place father they come
[1:42:04] sanely moving up not emotionally just
[1:42:07] come soberly and no place I believe
[1:42:10] God's fixing to do something great but
[1:42:12] now we got to approach it sanely
[1:42:14] intelligently and write in the Word of
[1:42:17] God it's taking that emotional faith
[1:42:21] that intellectual faith and place it
[1:42:23] upon the word and being focused about
[1:42:25] the promise in not the things of the
[1:42:26] flesh not even what's transpiring around
[1:42:29] you there's the times of the Holy Spirit
[1:42:33] of God is moving in a dynamic way in
[1:42:36] meetings and conventions especially in
[1:42:38] youth camps and you'll hear the cry the
[1:42:40] cry go out and a shouting and screaming
[1:42:43] and if you don't pick up the sound of it
[1:42:46] and the message it's actually torment
[1:42:49] it's actually an outburst and you could
[1:42:53] sense it sometimes they'll just give you
[1:42:54] chills and not because it's the
[1:42:56] rejoicing of a saint
[1:42:57] but it's summon wrestling with spirits
[1:42:59] wrestling's with demons and they just
[1:43:01] yell out a very tormenting cry and then
[1:43:03] another one does the same thing and
[1:43:05] another one does the same thing and we
[1:43:06] might be going oh praise the Lord in
[1:43:08] that wonderful but it's it's it's in the
[1:43:11] wrestling it's in the battle it's in
[1:43:14] that moment that they need the prayers
[1:43:15] of God they need their mind to be
[1:43:16] focused on the promise not all just let
[1:43:18] it out let it go vent yourself sister
[1:43:21] just pour it out oh it's been hard
[1:43:23] life's been hard yeah just VIN it out
[1:43:25] you've made mistakes just spit it out
[1:43:26] and then when you it's like almost
[1:43:28] prophetic weights like I've expressed it
[1:43:31] I've gotten it out this and I'm in that
[1:43:34] moment
[1:43:34] oh just spring it out but yet they
[1:43:38] didn't come according to the world where
[1:43:42] Branson works his faith express he says
[1:43:43] if he promised that he has to do it
[1:43:45] because he has to keep his word and he
[1:43:48] promised you the same thing that is if
[1:43:50] you would believe that it would happen
[1:43:51] if you can't believe it just won't
[1:43:53] happen now I can't make you believe
[1:43:55] neither can you make yourself believe
[1:43:56] God has to give it to you it's a gift of
[1:43:59] God to believe not your faith God's
[1:44:02] faith says your intellectual faith might
[1:44:05] believe it fine but unless the faith of
[1:44:08] God is done in your heart and I love
[1:44:10] this balance see your intellectual faith
[1:44:13] can accept it do that so if your
[1:44:17] intellectual faith can accept it do that
[1:44:20] what I'm emphasizing today is if your
[1:44:23] intellectual faith believes the message
[1:44:24] then reject it know if it can do that I
[1:44:29] mean you do a lot that a lot of people
[1:44:31] can't do you're still unreasonable to
[1:44:32] the world even though it's intellectual
[1:44:34] but you still haven't met God's
[1:44:36] requirements he says if you can
[1:44:38] intellectually accept it do that and
[1:44:40] just keep believing it with all your
[1:44:41] heart until dark God does reveal it to
[1:44:43] you just keep believing it until God
[1:44:46] does reveal it so if all you can do is
[1:44:50] intellectually believe it then just keep
[1:44:52] believing her just keep holding on to it
[1:44:56] and that's what Paul is expressing to
[1:44:59] the Corinthians he says our weapons are
[1:45:01] of our warfare are not carnal but mighty
[1:45:02] through God to the pulling down of
[1:45:04] strongholds
[1:45:04] so he says casting down imaginations
[1:45:06] every high thing that exalteth itself
[1:45:08] against the knowledge of God bringing
[1:45:10] into
[1:45:10] captivity every thought to the obedience
[1:45:12] of Christ imaginations it's a wreck and
[1:45:16] it's a calculation in your mind it's a
[1:45:17] reasoning which opposes God's Word and
[1:45:19] he's saying that we have to take any
[1:45:21] thought that's in competition to God's
[1:45:24] Word and we must cast it down and we
[1:45:28] don't do this by being loud we don't do
[1:45:30] this by being emotional
[1:45:31] we don't do this by saying well I'm just
[1:45:32] going to walk seven times around my
[1:45:34] computer it's not anything that we work
[1:45:36] up and we may try through emotions to
[1:45:38] get yet get to the place where we can
[1:45:40] deny something and accept something but
[1:45:42] it won't work you have to do it on the
[1:45:44] basis of God's Word we cannot try to
[1:45:49] manufacture faith in his word through
[1:45:50] emotionalism that won't last but mom
[1:45:55] talk she says it this way they had to
[1:45:57] have a little feeling or something
[1:45:58] little sensation one this and that and
[1:46:00] the other and they depended on that he
[1:46:02] couldn't teach them the deep things so I
[1:46:05] think it's a it's great when you get a
[1:46:07] people that you can teach deep things
[1:46:09] and the Holy Spirit can wind these great
[1:46:12] truths and anchor it into the people's
[1:46:14] hearts so that they know where they're
[1:46:15] standing sensation or no sensation
[1:46:19] prophecy or no prophecy and whatever it
[1:46:21] might be this is what brother Branham
[1:46:24] desires this is what he desired in his
[1:46:26] own ministry says but when they have to
[1:46:28] have a little feel in a little sensation
[1:46:29] this that and the other and they depend
[1:46:31] upon that he couldn't teach them the
[1:46:33] deep things it says if you get I love it
[1:46:38] we have a people you can teach deep
[1:46:39] things where the word can just be
[1:46:41] rightly divided it anchors in the hearts
[1:46:43] and they know where they're standing
[1:46:44] sensation and OH sensation you so much
[1:46:50] we just wanted to express here Paul
[1:46:54] writes in Romans chapter 10 he said they
[1:46:56] had a zeal speaking of Israel he said my
[1:46:58] heart's desire that God would bless him
[1:47:00] he said they have a zeal of God but not
[1:47:02] according to knowledge zeal that's not
[1:47:05] channeled towards present truth zooming
[1:47:08] is an excitement of mine an ardent
[1:47:10] fervor of something fervor of spirit but
[1:47:12] he's saying it's not stimulated by the
[1:47:13] word its enthusiasm but it's Genesis
[1:47:17] isn't the word coming to pass
[1:47:18] but the visco made her statement one
[1:47:20] time he said true worship is connected
[1:47:22] with the Word of God being fulfilled
[1:47:24] it never left me I thought that is the
[1:47:26] only way you could truly worship it has
[1:47:28] to be connected with the Word of God
[1:47:30] otherwise what is being worshiped what
[1:47:32] is being exalted it became a revelation
[1:47:35] to me one time I went into a charismatic
[1:47:37] service and literally everyone will
[1:47:39] stand around talking punching each other
[1:47:40] on the shoulder man they were just all
[1:47:42] having a good time and also the song
[1:47:44] leader got up there and he just went
[1:47:45] boop boop boop boop Pat it on the mic a
[1:47:47] little bit and immediately everybody was
[1:47:48] like wow and I caught me off guard
[1:47:51] because immediately they were just
[1:47:53] shouting and praising and everything I'm
[1:47:54] like my goodness what just happened and
[1:47:56] I realized they're shouting trying to
[1:47:59] find God they're trying to work
[1:48:01] something they got to build themselves
[1:48:02] into a frenzy
[1:48:03] so when they've worked up a sweat and
[1:48:05] somebody passes out in somebody dances
[1:48:07] and they get so wild and crazy the
[1:48:08] preacher can't preach they can say my
[1:48:10] goodness didn't got to have his way and
[1:48:12] I realized we've got it in the exact
[1:48:15] opposite it's it's after the word that
[1:48:19] has gone forth that we find ourselves
[1:48:20] the most expressive in worship and it
[1:48:24] doesn't have to be an excitable service
[1:48:26] it's just once the words gone forth we
[1:48:28] find ourselves our spirits are aligned
[1:48:30] we have a harmony with the word and we
[1:48:32] just feel we man we've been brought back
[1:48:33] to Center we believe God's Word and we
[1:48:35] begin to worship a present Christ not
[1:48:37] trying to find him somewhere not trying
[1:48:40] to call him out of heaven like they did
[1:48:41] on Mount Carmel but because he's a
[1:48:43] present God who just made himself known
[1:48:45] to us through the Living Word what - is
[1:48:49] our God that deserves praise this is a
[1:48:51] God that deserves worship and we don't
[1:48:53] just sit and service just twiddling our
[1:48:55] thumbs for whatever the song leader can
[1:48:56] get back up there and when are we gonna
[1:48:58] get our worship no bill worship is
[1:49:00] building as the word goes forth it's
[1:49:04] building as the word goes forth and
[1:49:06] you're saying hey man I believe that
[1:49:08] that's nothing but the truth hey man and
[1:49:11] as it's coming for something build
[1:49:13] something build it's something built and
[1:49:16] when you give vent to that revelation
[1:49:17] it's not merely just a shout of wonder
[1:49:21] but it's AIT's like I believe this this
[1:49:24] is life to me oh thank God for this
[1:49:30] they had a zeal without knowledge
[1:49:34] excited emotional listen they had zeal
[1:49:36] they were so zealous they killed a man
[1:49:39] that they thought opposed their faith
[1:49:44] they were so zealous they would rather
[1:49:46] have a murderer than a blasphemer and a
[1:49:53] zeal without knowledge can be excited it
[1:49:55] could be emotional but it's not in
[1:49:57] harmony with the word because its zeal
[1:49:59] without knowledge
[1:50:00] it's zeal when God hasn't spoken its
[1:50:04] enthusiasm as a prophet saying go down
[1:50:07] there you can do it you can do it and
[1:50:09] everyone saying go you can go and then
[1:50:10] one man with the words thing don't do it
[1:50:13] he's so excited so emotional you can
[1:50:16] just slap the bride right across the
[1:50:18] face slap the word right across the face
[1:50:20] and say where did the Spirit of God go
[1:50:22] when it went from you you talk about
[1:50:25] enthusiasm boldness and emotion but God
[1:50:29] hasn't spoken our zeal and enthusiasm
[1:50:31] must be according to the word of the
[1:50:34] time in the day no other source no other
[1:50:38] interpretation brother Brennan speaking
[1:50:41] aloud to Saint Church eggy says now this
[1:50:42] false Church has zeal make no mistake
[1:50:44] about that
[1:50:45] but it is a wrong zeal for it is it is
[1:50:50] for the house of their own building it
[1:50:53] is for their own creeds dogmas and
[1:50:56] organizations their own righteousness
[1:50:58] you can say about Jesus when he went
[1:51:01] brother BAM even said about Jesus when
[1:51:03] he braided those whips and purged the
[1:51:05] money changers from the house of God he
[1:51:08] said he wasn't operate in the fruits of
[1:51:09] the Spirit and he puts it in that
[1:51:12] context I think we might have Minister
[1:51:13] on that before and I know all of you
[1:51:14] just remember perfectly when we preached
[1:51:16] on love a decade ago or whatever and we
[1:51:19] point out that Jesus wasn't operating
[1:51:21] the fruits of the spirit when he did
[1:51:23] that but yet he was operating according
[1:51:26] to prophecy so even though it might look
[1:51:29] like anger even though it might look
[1:51:30] like an extreme and even though it might
[1:51:32] look like fanaticism the zeal of thine
[1:51:34] house hath eaten me up
[1:51:36] it was thine house and it was prophecy
[1:51:38] that made him to act so it wasn't out of
[1:51:41] he says but they have a house of their
[1:51:43] own building it's for their own creeds
[1:51:44] dogmas organizations their own
[1:51:45] righteousness they have put the word out
[1:51:47] for their own ideas they deposed the
[1:51:50] Holy Ghost and made men into leaders
[1:51:52] they have put aside eternal life as a
[1:51:54] person and made it good works or even
[1:51:56] church conformity rather than good words
[1:51:59] listen if I can say this don't live to
[1:52:02] go to church go to church to live your
[1:52:04] life isn't about this but but God has
[1:52:08] put this in your life for life we just
[1:52:11] don't live for our church experience but
[1:52:13] our life includes this we go to church
[1:52:16] to live we have the proper balance
[1:52:18] yes our life isn't these four walls and
[1:52:20] we just don't live for it for Bethel
[1:52:22] Tabernacle but we go to Bethel
[1:52:24] Tabernacle to live because we see it has
[1:52:27] a place in the Word of God that there's
[1:52:28] more to it than just hearing preaching
[1:52:30] let's be a part of the body part of a
[1:52:32] move of God part of a local fellowship
[1:52:35] and I realize that God ordains this not
[1:52:37] that this could be the all-in-all but
[1:52:39] that's through this I could reach the
[1:52:41] all and all that this is part of the all
[1:52:43] and all that through these organics and
[1:52:45] dynamics of this I will one day change
[1:52:47] my body by the faith that I have I will
[1:52:51] have a power to do it I will have power
[1:52:53] to be changed and I'll meet the Lord in
[1:52:55] the air this isn't the result of it
[1:53:00] that's just church conformity it's not
[1:53:06] just good works and church conformity my
[1:53:08] goodness we could get to the place where
[1:53:09] we just determined which works are the
[1:53:11] best well brother Jason I hear you're
[1:53:13] building church in Uganda who you think
[1:53:15] that's spiritual guess what I'm doing
[1:53:18] over here I'm feeding the poor in my
[1:53:19] local community let me start competing
[1:53:22] over who's actually doing something
[1:53:24] right when what's the measure you feel
[1:53:26] led to God to do to start a school you
[1:53:28] feel that of God to send instruments to
[1:53:30] the Philippines you feel that of God to
[1:53:32] go over in Muslim countries and do this
[1:53:34] you feel that of God to host these
[1:53:35] things and do these things
[1:53:37] bless may God bless you may God bless
[1:53:39] you may God bless you you better do your
[1:53:41] part because I'm doing mine I can only
[1:53:43] do mine and if you do yours and I do
[1:53:44] mind we're getting out of here but when
[1:53:47] I want to criticize your job and
[1:53:48] criticize yours job and act like I'm
[1:53:50] doing mine the
[1:53:50] this I ain't done my job yet wrong
[1:53:54] motive wrong objective even though it
[1:53:56] might be the word I haven't done my job
[1:53:58] yet listen whatever God reveals to you
[1:54:00] to do and you do it by revelation if you
[1:54:03] expect it through legalism for somebody
[1:54:05] else to do it you lose the blessing of
[1:54:07] your revelation God's revealed to me to
[1:54:09] do this well you better do it listen
[1:54:11] whatever blessing he wanted to give you
[1:54:13] in obedience you deprive yourself of it
[1:54:16] when you through legalism expected of
[1:54:18] somebody else play the part that God's
[1:54:21] called you to listen I can't be a
[1:54:23] dynamic man of God that sees cancer's
[1:54:26] follow that brings the place of the
[1:54:28] people to places where their things are
[1:54:31] revealed and things happen I may not
[1:54:32] have that kind of ministry but I cannot
[1:54:34] aspire to be that and miss out on what
[1:54:37] God's called me to i will not fulfill
[1:54:39] God's purpose so I'm happy to be what
[1:54:42] he's told me to be and I'm happy you are
[1:54:45] what you are because there's no way I
[1:54:48] could do my job if it wasn't for the men
[1:54:51] that are doing very no one person has it
[1:54:54] all figured out
[1:54:55] well my ministry can give you everything
[1:54:57] you need I've got the healing I've got
[1:54:59] the teaching I got the dynamic I'm all 5
[1:55:01] in 1 you're probably not one of them
[1:55:15] please don't judge me by your gift I'll
[1:55:19] fall short every time I'm not gonna
[1:55:22] judge you by my gift will fall short
[1:55:26] every time be what God's called you to
[1:55:29] be do you mind if I finish alright
[1:55:36] that's that sounds like a quorum brother
[1:55:42] Jason gave up this is the downside of me
[1:55:49] being able to see you now you can give
[1:55:51] me the non visual clues yeah no he says
[1:56:00] religious oh my they outshine the elect
[1:56:02] in effort and zeal but it is Laodicean
[1:56:05] not of christ don't confuse yourself
[1:56:08] with effort and zeal there's times and
[1:56:11] let me just be very direct there are
[1:56:14] certain gatherings around false doctrine
[1:56:17] that'll be much more charismatic and
[1:56:20] dynamic than any service we have and
[1:56:23] they use the charisma and the dynamics
[1:56:26] as vindication that they're right and
[1:56:29] then they say you don't you don't have
[1:56:32] this because what are they entered on
[1:56:36] and he says Africa's ill he says it's
[1:56:39] lay over seeing out of Christ for it
[1:56:40] looks for big crowds big programs
[1:56:41] startling signs among them they preach
[1:56:44] and I'm just let this be real rich to
[1:56:45] you they preach the second coming of
[1:56:47] Christ but deny the advent of the
[1:56:50] Prophet messenger are you picking up
[1:56:53] what he's laying down are you filling
[1:56:56] them it's a third pull he can't just
[1:56:59] come right out and say yeah they
[1:57:01] preached the Second Coming but they
[1:57:03] denied the very introduction
[1:57:06] though in power and signs and true
[1:57:09] revelation he eclipses them all yes this
[1:57:13] false spirit that in the last days is so
[1:57:15] close to the real can be distinguished
[1:57:17] only by its deviation from the word we
[1:57:23] only needed one prophet I don't need
[1:57:25] another one
[1:57:26] I had my messenger but this false peer
[1:57:30] can only be known not by its lack of
[1:57:33] signs and wonders but by its deviation
[1:57:35] from the word and whenever it is caught
[1:57:37] in being anti word it falls back on one
[1:57:41] argument we have already shown to be
[1:57:42] false we get results don't we we have to
[1:57:46] be of God
[1:57:48] that's intellectual faith that's
[1:57:51] emotional things well don't come
[1:57:53] challenging me that I don't believe the
[1:57:55] message look at the results I get look
[1:57:58] at the fruits of it and instead of
[1:58:00] saying well let's be one with the word
[1:58:02] let's identify ourselves with the word
[1:58:04] this must be God and we believe this is
[1:58:07] God but there's more word let's walk in
[1:58:08] it they fall back on this excuse that
[1:58:11] the results are enough for them to deny
[1:58:13] the word there's Villas not according to
[1:58:16] knowledge that hasn't been centered I
[1:58:19] might want to say it hasn't been birthed
[1:58:20] by the word of the hour but it hasn't
[1:58:22] been calibrated imbalanced it hasn't
[1:58:24] been brought into harmony with the floor
[1:58:26] to the our our emotional intellectual
[1:58:29] faith is not enough if that's all we
[1:58:32] have keep doing it till the revelation
[1:58:34] comes but we must have a revelation of
[1:58:37] the word of this age the wrong zeal can
[1:58:41] actually as I mentioned before crucify
[1:58:44] the word for its day it can be dogmatic
[1:58:49] here's brother Jason DeMars I'm getting
[1:58:52] used to the brother JD but it's brother
[1:58:54] Jason to Mars
[1:58:55] who said that there's times when we're
[1:58:57] very dogmatic where God allows
[1:58:59] differences and allow differences where
[1:59:01] God's dogmatic and we shouldn't do that
[1:59:03] and there's people that get dogmatic and
[1:59:07] they're so dogmatic they persecute
[1:59:10] the Sunday School lesson could just be I
[1:59:13] hear is hearing incorporated by
[1:59:14] reference what was all that will live
[1:59:17] godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:59:19] persecution and we're suffering because
[1:59:21] all hell is against this revelation that
[1:59:24] you have the truth alone and so zeal
[1:59:28] enthusiasm it can persecute it can bully
[1:59:30] it can intimidate but what matters is
[1:59:35] the word I'm not preaching against
[1:59:38] emotions I'd be a hypocrite because I'm
[1:59:42] getting emotional what if my preaching
[1:59:44] against it
[1:59:46] but well I'm wanting to place them on
[1:59:48] the right foundation I let me finish
[1:59:55] with this thought who's trying to find
[1:59:58] it identify this place of rest here if
[2:00:09] our emotions come from the word then
[2:00:12] there is no disorder our excitement our
[2:00:17] enthusiasm our worship our praise our
[2:00:18] amens if they're birthed by the word
[2:00:20] then then we it's it's it's in
[2:00:23] continuity with the spirit there's times
[2:00:27] where we are we are challenged even the
[2:00:31] dynamics of preaching say amen to that
[2:00:33] and and we might find ourselves they
[2:00:35] then pulled it right out of you will you
[2:00:40] say praise Lord pray Lord it's just kind
[2:00:44] of its kind of pulled out in you if I do
[2:00:46] it if I tell you to say man just
[2:00:48] something you can't say a man to just
[2:00:50] bite your lip and I'll just give you the
[2:00:53] Liberty no I won't it's my brother
[2:00:56] another brother says can you say amen to
[2:00:58] that and you can't just go no brother
[2:01:02] I'm right here with you I'm following
[2:01:05] you I hear what you're saying but no can
[2:01:06] say Amen that because we don't want to
[2:01:08] be pulled into some and there's some
[2:01:10] activity that it's just this isn't that
[2:01:13] responsive a reflex of the word of God
[2:01:16] that Amen and you find yourself excited
[2:01:19] by the word invigorated by it don't you
[2:01:22] love the fact that you can come to
[2:01:23] church looking forward to it
[2:01:25] is anybody ever been in a church we just
[2:01:27] didn't look forward to going to it don't
[2:01:29] raise your hands honey and you weren't
[2:01:32] excited about it you're like whoa I'm
[2:01:34] gonna have to do this I'm gonna have to
[2:01:35] do that and I'm gonna have to yeah and
[2:01:37] it's it's the worst thing in the world
[2:01:38] that's wonderful to come to church and
[2:01:42] have an excitement and enthusiasm and
[2:01:44] that word to keep building it and
[2:01:46] building and where that is in harmony
[2:01:48] and where that is in your heart then
[2:01:50] praise an expression with if the words
[2:01:52] first then let it come let me just say
[2:01:57] this I'm bringing it to a close the
[2:01:59] seals are opened what wouldn't we
[2:02:01] worship we're taught after they're open
[2:02:04] everything is worship we've got reason
[2:02:07] to praise we've got reason to shout
[2:02:09] we've got reason to dance we've got
[2:02:11] reason to live the life we've got reason
[2:02:15] we'd listen I love a ministry that makes
[2:02:17] the Seventh Seal relevant on Monday to
[2:02:19] Saturday
[2:02:19] not just appropriate on Sunday morning I
[2:02:21] love it when it hits home and it makes
[2:02:24] sense every day and it does it just
[2:02:26] doesn't result in charismatic services
[2:02:28] or conventions I love a message that's
[2:02:30] relevant in my daily life and that's
[2:02:33] what Lucia Smita praise that's what
[2:02:36] gives me living in the come to church
[2:02:37] and know this isn't hypocrisy this is
[2:02:40] coming from my life live by the word
[2:02:43] [Applause]
[2:02:47] well the best is everywhere you found
[2:02:49] Jesus you found a little noise the seals
[2:02:52] reveal Christ he is those seals that
[2:02:55] were open he said that kind of fits my
[2:02:59] Irish disposition and especially when
[2:03:02] it's been changed what does he
[2:03:05] acknowledge that some of us are
[2:03:06] predisposed to it excitement enthusiasm
[2:03:09] noise may fit your disposition that's
[2:03:14] why even without a berth you can enjoy
[2:03:16] certain services even without a berth
[2:03:19] you enjoy songs even without a berth you
[2:03:23] could take young people raised in the
[2:03:25] message who are sanctified who are
[2:03:28] living clean lives and without a berth
[2:03:30] you can you can have certain songs that
[2:03:33] work them to a place of worship and it's
[2:03:36] entirely through an emotional realm
[2:03:39] nothing wrong with it at all nothing
[2:03:41] wrong with it at all we just it can just
[2:03:44] fit our disposition and it's so if it
[2:03:46] doesn't fit your disposition
[2:03:48] don't be critical of it if it just if it
[2:03:53] doesn't fit if you're not Irish if
[2:03:54] you're more German brother man said hey
[2:03:56] where Jesus is there's a lot of noise if
[2:03:57] it's my disposition it may not fit yours
[2:04:00] but my goodness don't be critical of
[2:04:03] Jesus I mean inject this I mean I've
[2:04:09] taken maybe I've made the mistake of not
[2:04:11] making myself clear sometimes when I've
[2:04:13] preached on Pentecost and Pentecostalism
[2:04:15] and some people just maybe default to
[2:04:17] say well Pentecostalism that's them
[2:04:18] that's a way of worship it's a way it
[2:04:20] expresses no it has nothing to do that
[2:04:22] Pentecostalism is a failure to walk
[2:04:24] further in the Word of God has nothing
[2:04:26] to do with how you how you conduct your
[2:04:27] song services it has nothing to do with
[2:04:29] your expression and worship someone can
[2:04:31] be just as Pentecostal and never one
[2:04:33] time raise their hands they could be
[2:04:36] they could be fully possessed by
[2:04:38] Pentecostalism and never want to shout
[2:04:40] Amen because it Pentecost was not
[2:04:44] walking further in the revealed word of
[2:04:45] the hour where Jesus is there's always
[2:04:50] noise so it's not whether you're
[2:04:54] predisposed to emotion or whether or not
[2:04:56] you're making a lot of noise are you in
[2:04:58] the word it's the only way you're gonna
[2:05:01] know if you're walking in truth only way
[2:05:03] you're gonna know is if you're in the
[2:05:04] word so everywhere Jesus appears in the
[2:05:07] message who is Jesus there's usually
[2:05:08] somebody there to hear him and before he
[2:05:12] got there he heard a noise so we want to
[2:05:15] hear him not the noise but recognize
[2:05:18] that where he is there's noise and they
[2:05:21] were singing all kinds of song glory to
[2:05:23] God in the highest and all these fine
[2:05:25] hands they were singing in some
[2:05:26] screaming and shouting he says isn't it
[2:05:28] strange where Jesus is there's always a
[2:05:31] lot of noise so where Jesus is there's
[2:05:36] always noise but the message isn't in
[2:05:39] the noise the message is in his voice we
[2:05:43] appears he wants to speak and there's
[2:05:45] always someone there to hear him so we
[2:05:47] know that where he is there's noise
[2:05:49] but I don't want to be satisfied with
[2:05:51] the noise I want to hear him listen the
[2:05:55] wind the fire and the earthquake
[2:05:57] declared the presence of God he passed
[2:06:00] by and there was an earthquake he passed
[2:06:02] by and there was a wind he passed by and
[2:06:05] there was an earthquake but the message
[2:06:07] was in the still small voice he was made
[2:06:09] known in the voice I don't I don't want
[2:06:12] the knocking I don't want the noise I
[2:06:14] want the voice but I recognized that the
[2:06:21] noise comes before the voice and when
[2:06:24] he's describing this same what
[2:06:26] scriptures being fulfilled he comes
[2:06:28] riding in and fulfillment scripture
[2:06:29] Hosanna glory to God in the highest the
[2:06:31] shouting singing praises to him and
[2:06:34] turned right around and with the same
[2:06:35] mouth shout crucify oh brother BAM said
[2:06:39] phew recognized him to be the anointed
[2:06:42] word of the day
[2:06:45] what were they worship even him in the
[2:06:48] enthusiasm of the moment not even
[2:06:50] realizing what they were doing and we're
[2:06:53] not just worshiping in the enthusiasm of
[2:06:55] it we're not worshiping in a glare we're
[2:06:56] not worshiping under some kind of
[2:06:58] manufactured Pentecost we have the
[2:07:00] original Pentecost
[2:07:01] we've been restored back to Pentecost
[2:07:03] it's not a dirty word it's not the
[2:07:06] possession of a domination it's not some
[2:07:07] other it's not some man's idea it's the
[2:07:09] bride's and we're worshipping in
[2:07:12] Revelations five we're worshiping in
[2:07:15] Revelations 10 we've recognized they
[2:07:19] don't know two words for this day there
[2:07:21] was noise there was commotion but really
[2:07:24] how many solved the attraction Jesus
[2:07:30] said is the spirit that quickeneth the
[2:07:31] flesh profiteth nothing the words that I
[2:07:33] speak unto you they are spirit and they
[2:07:35] are life it's the word first let the
[2:07:40] word bring the healing let the word
[2:07:43] bring the praise let the word bring the
[2:07:45] manifestations but Aram said jesus never
[2:07:49] distressed the importance of works as he
[2:07:51] did the word he knew that the people got
[2:07:54] the word the works would follow that is
[2:07:58] Bible
[2:08:01] if the people got the word the works
[2:08:03] will follow we'll invite the musicians
[2:08:05] to come he said Jesus didn't stress the
[2:08:10] importance of works over the word and so
[2:08:14] he didn't and he didn't downplay one or
[2:08:17] the other he just put it in order he
[2:08:20] knew that people got the word the work
[2:08:22] should follow so why would you preached
[2:08:24] against works
[2:08:26] it's what follows the word and so if you
[2:08:29] preach against works you only hinder the
[2:08:31] word but if he preached works first you
[2:08:35] still hinder the word it's got to be in
[2:08:38] order so if it seems like Mambro the
[2:08:41] errand has just been like a pendulum
[2:08:42] swing well I'm just trying to pull from
[2:08:44] here trying to pull from they're trying
[2:08:46] to bring right in the middle to make you
[2:08:47] realize we've got to be centered on the
[2:08:49] Word of God it's got to be right in
[2:08:53] harmony with the truth of it as a young
[2:09:00] man it ran in the it ran in our family
[2:09:06] manic depression spirits of melancholy I
[2:09:10] remember going back and reading my
[2:09:12] great-grandmother's diary and I would
[2:09:16] read her words and I'd feel the same
[2:09:18] feeling she was feeling and it was
[2:09:20] almost haunting I I know I know how she
[2:09:23] feels the blue she had to think she was
[2:09:25] experiencing and I say I know a place in
[2:09:31] Christ that changes all that
[2:09:35] there's joy in this message one of my
[2:09:40] favorite sayings and all the messages at
[2:09:42] the very very end of the church age book
[2:09:44] it's not prophecy it's reality and may
[2:09:48] his coming rejoice your heart we're
[2:09:52] living in a reality that gives us joy
[2:09:55] and my joy comes from him my rest comes
[2:09:59] from him it's not based in Laodicea
[2:10:02] forgive me I don't mean this
[2:10:04] disrespectfully it's not even based upon
[2:10:06] an uncommon uncommon promise it's rooted
[2:10:09] in a reality it's based upon his the
[2:10:12] forgiveness of sins the baptism of the
[2:10:15] Holy Ghost the newness of life and
[2:10:18] nothing stimulates me more and gets me
[2:10:21] more excited than the Word of God
[2:10:23] nothing thrills me more than this
[2:10:25] message and there's nothing more
[2:10:27] invigorating and stimulating for you
[2:10:30] believers may be coming out of the
[2:10:32] shadow these stay-at-home orders in the
[2:10:34] specter of a pandemic that is trying to
[2:10:37] bring us low listen it's time for us to
[2:10:40] put shoulders back and heads up and
[2:10:42] rejoice and praise and be loosed because
[2:10:46] we're not bound by fear we're not bound
[2:10:48] by politics we're not waiting for the
[2:10:50] cycle of an election to know which way
[2:10:52] we're gonna praise which way we're gonna
[2:10:54] run and what we're going to do we're
[2:10:56] going up we're going up and this bride
[2:10:59] is enjoying the stimulation of
[2:11:02] Revelation the power of Revelation
[2:11:08] brings stimulation to the believer the
[2:11:11] power of natural wine stimulates brings
[2:11:15] a person that's all slumped down to
[2:11:17] stimulation he goes Weldon now there's a
[2:11:21] power of Revelation of the word that
[2:11:24] distillations of joy to the believer
[2:11:27] stimulation of satisfaction stimulation
[2:11:31] that it's vindicated it's proved
[2:11:33] as natural wine reveals itself and
[2:11:36] stimulated power so does the new one as
[2:11:39] it reveals the Word of God which is
[2:11:41] spirit the word itself is spirit on 6:63
[2:11:45] the word itself is spirit its spirit in
[2:11:47] Word form then you see when it's
[2:11:51] quickened are brought to life the spirit
[2:11:53] of the word goes to work and acts you
[2:12:00] have the stimulation of Revelation
[2:12:02] behind you that's the joy you have
[2:12:05] though the random in the easter cele
[2:12:07] says there's a lot of people that really
[2:12:08] think they got it when they haven't a
[2:12:10] lot of people do it because they've got
[2:12:12] some false impression of what they seen
[2:12:14] other Christians do Satan can
[2:12:17] impersonate any event we don't want to
[2:12:20] have like a mimetic compulsion that's
[2:12:22] what all these means are dealing with
[2:12:24] and it's some kind of it's like a we say
[2:12:27] it goes viral yeah it's referring to an
[2:12:28] infection and everybody starts doing the
[2:12:31] same thing what are you doing if you
[2:12:34] ever wonder why your kids are over there
[2:12:36] doing these funny things
[2:12:37] it's tick tock don't worry about it well
[2:12:39] maybe you should worry about it but
[2:12:42] they're all wondering can you do this
[2:12:43] dance can you do that can you do this
[2:12:44] and it infects them and they all begin
[2:12:47] to act and we see that compulsion work
[2:12:50] through social media and apps like
[2:12:51] snapchat and kick talking these things
[2:12:54] and what is it doing it's working in a
[2:12:56] round to cause human nature to mimic and
[2:13:00] we can do the same thing as an
[2:13:04] impersonator of the real within Christ
[2:13:06] don't settle for an impersonation get
[2:13:09] the real thing don't shout because she
[2:13:12] shouted you shout because you've got it
[2:13:14] chat with nobody else's dance when
[2:13:17] nobody else does
[2:13:18] does praise when nobody else is praising
[2:13:20] smile and nobody else to smiling why
[2:13:22] because I got it that on the inside
[2:13:28] he says as missionaries you can see it
[2:13:31] in person it shouting dancing speaking
[2:13:33] in tongues all these things you can see
[2:13:35] it impersonating anywhere absolutely
[2:13:37] amongst heathens and people who deny
[2:13:39] there's even such a thing as Jesus
[2:13:40] Christ being the son of God and they do
[2:13:42] all these things themself but the real
[2:13:45] true quickening spirit that comes to a
[2:13:48] believer quickens them to God's Word
[2:13:50] that's back to Eagles food again hey man
[2:13:55] look I think about how excited we get
[2:13:57] when we go to eat we get on you know
[2:14:02] chippy hey man hey how's it going you

[2:14:14] body word of the son of man now we're
[2:14:17] back to Eagles food again I wanna soar
[2:14:20] above all these carnal things Carl
[2:14:22] impersonations
[2:14:24] so our above intellectual faith so our
[2:14:26] above emotionalism floor above formalism
[2:14:28] I want to be balanced as an eagle
[2:14:30] soaring into the heavenlies and the
[2:14:34] revelation of the manifestation of the
[2:14:36] word of this hour
[2:14:37] has stimulated me stimulates the
[2:14:40] believer not an interpretation not an
[2:14:43] impersonation but the very manifestation
[2:14:45] of the vindicated promise today it
[2:14:48] stimulates me I won't repress and I
[2:14:52] won't mimic I won't do anything but
[2:14:54] yield to the power of God listen if your
[2:14:57] mind is clear right now before God if
[2:14:59] through these things we've wondered back
[2:15:01] and forth of the word if you feel you
[2:15:03] have an emotional alignment with the
[2:15:05] Word of God whatever you have need of in
[2:15:07] this very moment why don't you take God
[2:15:09] at His Word and receive it not in the
[2:15:12] work up of it not in the enthusiasm of
[2:15:14] it even disregard my fervent sing now
[2:15:17] and just merely look to the promise by
[2:15:19] his stripes come him God gave the
[2:15:22] promise that I'd be safe he'd give me
[2:15:24] the baptism of the holy accept it now in
[2:15:26] the name of the Lord
[2:15:28] let's stand to our feet as real
[2:15:31] believers we accept these things we
[2:15:37] believe it what is it listen I oh my
[2:15:44] goodness what a pullings bunch well I
[2:15:53] know why you cancel the evening service
[2:15:55] you just heard why you don't have one
[2:15:56] because you you're likely to preach into
[2:15:58] the evening it's good thing you didn't
[2:16:02] preach brother Danny I've heard it
[2:16:10] preached before I mean no disrespect to
[2:16:11] the way that it's typed but the story
[2:16:15] when Jesus visited the Pool of Bethesda
[2:16:17] the angel the Lord would come and stir
[2:16:19] the waters and whoever got in got healed
[2:16:23] and we can accurately we can preach the
[2:16:29] angel the Lord is stirring the waters
[2:16:31] get in but the truth that was revealed
[2:16:35] in that instance was even a that without
[2:16:38] the waters being stirred Christ is here
[2:16:42] to meet your need because that's exactly
[2:16:46] what happened he said I don't have any
[2:16:47] way to jump into the stirring of the
[2:16:48] waters and here was the way the truth
[2:16:50] the life here is the one who could heal
[2:16:53] him in his need and it wasn't the
[2:16:54] stirring of the waters anymore it was at
[2:16:58] one time but now Christ had come to the
[2:17:03] elective Christ had audience to the one
[2:17:07] who was ordained the one who had a need
[2:17:11] for many many years and it wouldn't be
[2:17:14] met in the stirring of the waters where
[2:17:16] anyone would come in but now where
[2:17:19] people misunderstood the love and
[2:17:21] compassion of God Christ comes down in
[2:17:24] the midst of the confused and perverse
[2:17:26] in chaotic age and he comes only to the
[2:17:29] elect to give them the healing they need
[2:17:31] I love it when the waters are stirred
[2:17:34] but
[2:17:35] right now Christ the word has made
[2:17:37] himself known to you receive him take
[2:17:43] him at his word no I believe devil says
[2:17:49] wow you got a little bit of work well
[2:17:51] okay that's just in this flesh that's
[2:17:53] evidence of nothing greater is He that
[2:17:57] is in me
[2:17:59] greater is He that is in man listen the
[2:18:04] trick the devil's played on us is we've
[2:18:07] taken what seems great and it is big but
[2:18:12] we've made it greater and you might have
[2:18:15] in yourself I have a little bit of faith
[2:18:16] brother here and I have a little bit of
[2:18:18] faith to believe but got a whole lot of
[2:18:20] doubt and it's a forced perspective of
[2:18:24] the devil that makes the doubt look
[2:18:27] bigger than faith because if you have
[2:18:30] the least amount of faith it's greater
[2:18:33] than all the doubt in the world so you
[2:18:37] take what you have this morning whatever
[2:18:40] the least is you take it and you fight
[2:18:43] whatever is great and you say it's
[2:18:45] greater it's greater its greater this
[2:18:48] strength is greater it may not seem like
[2:18:51] much but it's greater why it's connected
[2:18:54] with the eternal it's Treg connected
[2:18:57] with the endless let's bow our heads in
[2:19:00] prayer just thank them now for his touch
[2:19:07] thank him now for the victory thank him
[2:19:12] now for the healing thank them for the
[2:19:14] deliverance thank him for the assurance
[2:19:17] how could you give that in the absence
[2:19:20] of an evidence or manifestation faith
[2:19:23] moves me to worship faith moves me to
[2:19:26] praise faith moves me to worship under
[2:19:29] the revelation that's why I'm walking
[2:19:33] the way that I'm walking
[2:19:36] or blessed be the name of the law maybe
[2:19:41] you could just play the song bless the
[2:19:42] Lord O my soul oh my gosh up the Lord a
[2:19:46] little bit thank you Jesus thank you

[2:20:28] make yourself known to your daughter and
[2:20:31] your son you knew before the foundation

[2:20:45] Ghost say I have heard you'll cry and I
[2:20:50] am come down to deliver you may it be
[2:20:56] base solidly upon the promise may they

[2:23:26] worshipers of the Living God and he's

[2:24:46] contend you're the only God whose name
[2:24:51] and raise would never end and you're the
[2:24:57] only God who's worthy of everything we
[2:25:02] can give oh you are God and that's just
[2:25:07] the way
[2:25:13] from before time began you are on death
[2:25:19] row in the good times and fire

[2:28:16] [Applause]
[2:28:18] [Music]
[2:28:21] it's wonderful to know that God has sent
[2:28:25] a word so powerful that it dismisses all
[2:28:28] other arguments I don't care what other
[2:28:31] argument your symptom is shouting at you
[2:28:34] I don't care what other argument your
[2:28:35] mind may be telling you I realized today
[2:28:37] I have a new appreciation for brother
[2:28:39] Branham saying the right mental attitude
[2:28:41] toward any promise of God because
[2:28:44] sometimes we got to have the word to get
[2:28:46] our mental attitude right so that's not
[2:28:49] perfect faith but that's so perfect
[2:28:51] faith King Tom how many perceived
[2:28:53] perfect faith today take this mental
[2:28:57] attitude toward the promise of God it's
[2:28:59] more powerful than your sickness more
[2:29:02] powerful than your trouble more powerful
[2:29:04] than your circumstance say but my
[2:29:06] circumstance is real I was fine I'm to
[2:29:08] say they don't matter the only thing
[2:29:11] that matters is his word and that he's
[2:29:14] in control of it all so I love I love I
[2:29:18] don't think I've ever heard it said like
[2:29:19] that that sure say well my fear feels
[2:29:22] real yeah but it's not an evidence yeah
[2:29:26] but the circumstances it's quite this
[2:29:27] circumstance I'm in brothers quite real
[2:29:29] but that's no evidence think about a
[2:29:32] word that came in dismisses all evidence
[2:29:34] contrary to God's Word then I don't have
[2:29:37] to argue with the devil then I can just
[2:29:39] dismiss it I can truly say Satan you
[2:29:43] just don't matter and the circumstance
[2:29:45] fine whatever but it don't matter
[2:29:48] I believe the word I accepted for me
[2:29:52] today in my circumstance I'll praise it
[2:29:57] right in the trial I'll praise don't
[2:30:00] wait till it's over that's an insult
[2:30:02] don't wait till it's over don't wait
[2:30:04] till the victory comes crazy now Amen
[2:30:08] give vent to your faith by worshipping
[2:30:11] God in the midst of the trial in the
[2:30:14] midst of the storm you notice in the
[2:30:17] midst of the storm the disciples are
[2:30:18] terrified Jesus wasn't at all terrified
[2:30:20] he didn't have to wait till he rebuked
[2:30:23] the storm he woke up not terrified in
[2:30:27] the story he went to sleep in the storm
[2:30:31] you know what he did he just you know
[2:30:33] why cuz the Bible said God giveth his
[2:30:35] servants rest so you know what he was
[2:30:37] took not at his word when sleep and when
[2:30:40] he woke up and they said Lord don't you
[2:30:42] care that we perish nobody was gonna
[2:30:44] perish Jesus was in the boat nobody was
[2:30:47] gonna perish can you just accept that
[2:30:50] today so he's in my boat I ain't
[2:30:52] perishing hallelujah I got the master of
[2:30:55] the wind so it doesn't matter come what
[2:30:58] may whatever he's allowed fine brother
