[44:47] name
[44:48] amen
[44:52] i'm not a very deep preacher you all
[44:54] know that so if you come to hear
[44:56] something deep just come back this
[44:57] weekend
[44:58] brother jason will be preaching
[45:02] so i am who i am
[45:06] and the same day when the even was come
[45:09] he saith unto them let us pass over unto
[45:11] the other side
[45:13] and when they had sent away the
[45:14] multitude they took him even as he was
[45:17] in the ship
[45:19] and there were also with him other
[45:21] little ships
[45:22] and there rose a great storm of wind and
[45:24] the waves beat into the ship
[45:27] so that it was now full
[45:29] and he was in the hinder part of the
[45:31] ship asleep on a pillow
[45:33] and they awake him
[45:35] and say unto him master carest not
[45:38] carest thou not that we perish
[45:41] and he arose and rebuked the wind and
[45:43] said unto the sea peace be still
[45:46] and the wind ceased
[45:48] and there was a great calm
[45:50] and he said unto them why are you so
[45:52] fearful how is it that you have no faith
[45:55] and they feared exceedingly
[45:58] and said one to another what manner of
[46:01] man is this that even the wind and sea
[46:03] obey him
[46:05] may god have the blessings to his
[46:06] reading you have your seats
[46:12] so who is this man in your boat
[46:16] what manner of man
[46:18] that even the winds and the ways obey
[46:20] him
[46:22] but in order to see who he who he was
[46:25] you gotta we gotta go back we gotta go
[46:28] back to where there was
[46:30] no universe
[46:32] no star
[46:33] no atoms no molecules
[46:36] back before god was even god we know
[46:39] last week last wednesday brother joe
[46:40] mentioned a little bit about this but
[46:42] genesis said in the beginning god
[46:45] created the heavens and the earth
[46:47] that was who's in that boat god the
[46:49] creator of the universe the one who
[46:52] spoke things into existence
[46:54] the self-existing one
[46:56] the one who was along with no one to
[46:58] worship him because we know god is an
[47:00] object of worship
[47:01] there was no one there so we created the
[47:03] angels and the cherubims to worship him
[47:06] they cry holy holy holy all day long
[47:08] worshiping god but that wasn't what he
[47:10] wanted that was part of it but he needed
[47:13] something further
[47:14] god created them brother branham said
[47:17] and this is a pretty lengthy
[47:18] lengthy quote
[47:20] but
[47:21] the fir in his question answered on
[47:23] genesis
[47:24] the first creation was god himself
[47:28] and then out of god came the logos which
[47:30] was the son of god
[47:32] then out of the logos which was the word
[47:35] out of the logos came forth the man
[47:37] oh i got a beautiful picture of my mind
[47:39] he says
[47:40] if you could take just a little trip
[47:43] let's take a little trip and go back a
[47:45] little while
[47:46] let's go back about 100 million years
[47:50] before there ever was a star moon or
[47:52] anything in the world
[47:53] there was time
[47:55] when there was nothing here it was just
[47:57] all forever and eternity
[48:00] and all
[48:01] of ever and eternity was god
[48:04] he was there in the beginning
[48:06] now no man has seen the father at any
[48:08] time no man can see god in bodily form
[48:11] because god is not in body form god is a
[48:13] spirit
[48:14] notice there's nothing
[48:16] just space
[48:18] no light
[48:19] no dark no nothing it just seems nothing
[48:23] but in there is this great supernatural
[48:25] being jehovah god who covered all space
[48:28] and all places of time he was from
[48:31] everlasting from everlasting he is the
[48:34] beginning of creation that's god
[48:37] you can't see nothing he can't hear
[48:39] nothing
[48:40] not a move of adam in the air
[48:42] nothing
[48:44] but yet god was there
[48:47] that was god no man has seen that that's
[48:50] the father that's god the father notice
[48:52] then after a while i began to see a
[48:54] little sacred light begin to form a
[48:57] little halo or something you could see
[48:59] only see it by spiritual eyes while
[49:02] we're looking the whole church now
[49:04] we're standing on a great big banister
[49:07] watching what god's doing
[49:10] now
[49:10] no one has seen god he keeps saying this
[49:13] and now the next thing we see by the
[49:16] eyes of supernatural looking we see a
[49:18] little white light forming out there
[49:21] what is that
[49:23] the bible reader you know it is is logos
[49:26] or anointed or the anointing and i'm
[49:28] going to say the part of god began to
[49:31] develop into something so human beings
[49:34] could have some type of idea of what it
[49:36] was
[49:37] hallelujah was a little light moving
[49:41] that was the word of god
[49:43] john 1 1 says in the beginning was the
[49:45] word and the word was with god and the
[49:48] word was god god gave birth to himself
[49:52] to this son which was before there even
[49:54] was an adam or heir to make an adam
[49:57] jesus says glorify me father
[49:59] hallelujah with the glory that we had
[50:02] before the foundation of the world
[50:04] hallelujah logos holy spirit
[50:08] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[50:10] among us
[50:11] god unfolding himself down to a human
[50:14] being now watch how he did it
[50:17] back there when this little halo comes
[50:20] he can't see nothing yet
[50:22] but just by eyes of just supernatural we
[50:24] see a halo standing there that's the son
[50:27] of god the logos
[50:29] now i can see him playing around like a
[50:31] little child before the father's door
[50:34] this is who's in your boat this evening
[50:37] did all of this with all eternity and
[50:40] then his imaginary makeup he began to
[50:42] think of what things would be
[50:45] he thought of you
[50:47] he thought of what you're going to be
[50:49] he thought of what you're going to want
[50:51] to be
[50:52] hallelujah he had these attributes he
[50:56] he wanted to be a healer
[50:58] he want to be a savior he want to be a
[51:00] father oh he wants you to keep going on
[51:03] there's all kinds of things that god
[51:04] wanted to be but all of a sudden
[51:07] he said let there be light
[51:10] and we know what happened a little
[51:12] clinker come off of this logos and went
[51:14] down and god said let it drop for a few
[51:16] million years and all of a sudden he
[51:18] says stop
[51:19] is about the size of the earth
[51:24] dropped it in a perfect atmosphere
[51:26] and we know that the the planet earth is
[51:29] the only one that's named in this bible
[51:32] there's no other promise for no other
[51:33] planet
[51:35] adam bursted the sun came into existence
[51:37] she whirled for hundreds of millions of
[51:39] years forming little clinkers burning
[51:42] forming it is today still burning still
[51:44] breaking atoms watch beautifully says he
[51:48] made the sun then the first thing you
[51:50] know the big clinker fell off of it
[51:52] and just about the size of the earth
[51:54] which
[51:55] that's the logos here the son of god is
[51:58] watching it
[51:59] he he watched it dropping he just said
[52:01] stop
[52:02] hallelujah come on he's got something in
[52:06] his mind
[52:07] and what he's doing he's just writing
[52:09] his first bible
[52:11] oh
[52:12] when his first little clinker come off
[52:14] and it was earth god spoke to it let
[52:17] there be seed let there be water in a
[52:19] land and all let's let there be man he
[52:21] put adam on the earth
[52:23] this is who we serve
[52:26] this is who's in your boat
[52:28] hallelujah gotta get this thing off
[52:31] brother jason let me i take the tie off
[52:37] this is who jesus is
[52:39] that's the one you have in your heart
[52:41] he's the creator the very one who spoke
[52:44] things into existence in your life
[52:46] tonight
[52:48] oh hallelujah
[52:50] why do we worry
[52:53] why should we fear
[52:55] that very same jesus is standing right
[52:58] here
[52:59] all we have to do is open up our
[53:01] spiritual eyes and we can see it
[53:04] hallelujah
[53:05] glory to god why do you worry about a
[53:08] bill
[53:09] when the one who spoke let there be
[53:10] light
[53:12] can speak healing into your body if
[53:14] you're sick
[53:15] can bless your finances all you got to
[53:18] do is speak it

[53:39] had created the heavens and the earth

[56:14] one day we won't have to worry about
[56:15] that no more
[56:17] we know where sin is going
[56:19] sin is going to be in hell while we're
[56:22] celebrating in the millennium
[56:24] peace for a thousand years
[56:27] my mind can't comprehend that
[56:29] i can't comprehend a thousand years
[56:31] peace and millennium and then eternity
[56:33] after that
[56:34] hallelujah but we're only going to go
[56:36] back to the garden we got to fulfill
[56:38] that thousand years that the devil stole
[56:40] from them
[56:41] hallelujah there's no sickness no death
[56:43] no worries no sin nothing could bother
[56:46] them in that perfect place
[56:49] how long to go back there

[56:52] all if the wind would come up he would
[56:54] go oh it's a little cool
[56:56] i would just say peace be still
[57:00] we'll hear that again later
[57:02] he had authority he had the same
[57:04] authority that god had we god spoke to
[57:07] the wind told it to calm down
[57:10] oh if you have god in your heart you
[57:11] have that same authority
[57:14] you have sickness speak to it
[57:16] hallelujah when it all seemed lost adam
[57:19] fell we know the story it had to happen
[57:22] because god had attributes he needed to
[57:24] redeem people
[57:25] adam and eve crying as he left
[57:28] no doubt god crying as he left
[57:30] seeing the lambskin slapping her legs
[57:33] and blood running down right before they
[57:34] got out the gate of the garden he
[57:36] stopped them
[57:37] said hold on a minute i'm gonna make a
[57:41] way for you to come back here
[57:43] and brother and sister we could be
[57:45] listed 12 hours away from a rapture
[57:51] to bring us back to there we could be
[57:54] three and a half years from that spot
[57:58] hallelujah
[58:00] but we know what happened four thousand
[58:01] years later
[58:03] the promise was fulfilled a virgin shall
[58:05] conceive
[58:07] and jesus was born of the spoken word
[58:11] the holy ghost they called his name
[58:12] jesus he wasn't born a woman
[58:15] he wasn't born from sex desire he was
[58:17] born of god
[58:18] hallelujah jesus mary was conceived by
[58:22] the holy ghost
[58:24] if you have been saved and baptized and
[58:26] filled with the holy ghost you're
[58:27] conceived the same way
[58:30] hallelujah
[58:31] okay that's the foundation now i'm ready
[58:33] to preach
[58:36] oh i forgot to turn my timer on
[58:39] but anyway you know jesus ministry back
[58:41] to our scripture jesus ministry
[58:44] he was in his early stages
[58:46] and he got
[58:48] preaching and he was healing and sick
[58:51] and casting out devils and raising the
[58:53] dead and these people they loved it
[58:55] because the miracles
[58:57] they were crowding and their story took
[58:59] place they were crowded and jesus had to
[59:01] step into a boat
[59:02] he had to get some air
[59:04] he couldn't breathe
[59:06] so jesus got his boat started preaching
[59:11] but he was tired
[59:14] he was a man
[59:16] man get tired i couldn't imagine how
[59:18] tired jesus was
[59:21] after he healed the sick all day and
[59:22] preached the gospel and all the things
[59:24] that he'd done that day right before he
[59:26] got in this boat
[59:28] i know how tired i am after 45 minutes
[59:30] an hour up here i couldn't imagine how
[59:32] tired jesus was
[59:34] i look
[59:36] they were they people were pulling on
[59:37] him
[59:38] to perform miracles
[59:39] they seen all that he done
[59:42] they seen him raise a dead man
[59:44] they seen him break the bread
[59:46] and feed five thousand they seen all the
[59:48] miracles
[59:49] oh they loved all that
[59:51] but we may find out if we get to it
[59:53] that he had to do something to get rid
[59:54] of half these people
[59:56] because they weren't seed but that's
[59:58] something else they were pulling on
[1:00:00] jesus pull to perform miracles he was
[1:00:02] very tired verse 36
[1:00:05] we'll go back to that when they had sent
[1:00:07] away the multitude they took him even as
[1:00:10] he was in the ship
[1:00:12] and they were also other little ships
[1:00:14] the bible says they took him
[1:00:16] meaning they didn't prepare for the trip
[1:00:19] they didn't have time to go into town
[1:00:21] and buy food
[1:00:23] take clothes
[1:00:24] they didn't have time to get the right
[1:00:25] kind of boat
[1:00:28] according to history this boat these
[1:00:30] disciples got it that jesus had stepped
[1:00:32] in to preach was a fishing boat
[1:00:35] had the dips in the sides
[1:00:36] it wasn't made for going out on the sea
[1:00:38] on long trips
[1:00:40] especially in storms but god knows what
[1:00:43] he's doing
[1:00:44] hallelujah
[1:00:45] he knows what he's what disciples didn't
[1:00:47] know but in a spiritual realm
[1:00:50] jesus had heard a man across the river
[1:00:53] screaming for help
[1:00:56] oh he knew he would need his strength
[1:00:58] so jesus he just gets in the boat
[1:01:00] he goes back there and he just goes to
[1:01:02] sleep
[1:01:06] jesus tired
[1:01:08] he was needing his rest
[1:01:10] he would need his strength for what was
[1:01:12] coming
[1:01:13] across the sea
[1:01:15] a man was crying for help and jesus was
[1:01:17] going over there
[1:01:19] 30 37 there rose a great storm
[1:01:22] and the waves beat into the ship that it
[1:01:25] was now full
[1:01:26] but said i could see him that night
[1:01:28] crossing the sea
[1:01:30] oh my the waves are roaring
[1:01:32] why did that man take that chance after
[1:01:35] setting teaching all day and healing the
[1:01:37] sick and we find him now at that little
[1:01:39] ship coming across the sea because over
[1:01:42] in another land in gattera
[1:01:44] one soul was calling for him
[1:01:47] think across the sea in a mighty storm
[1:01:52] all through those dangerous perils as he
[1:01:54] went that night to save one soul
[1:01:56] to heal one person he'll come from one
[1:01:59] side of the lake through the storm
[1:02:01] all night long until the next day
[1:02:04] to storm that great tide that night to
[1:02:06] heal one person
[1:02:08] and he'll say i say this my brother
[1:02:12] he'll come down from glory
[1:02:14] this evening
[1:02:15] to set each one of you free
[1:02:18] that's right he'll come down through
[1:02:20] every church he'll go past every fanatic
[1:02:22] and every critic
[1:02:24] and everything else to heal you tonight
[1:02:28] or to make you right
[1:02:30] do you believe it
[1:02:33] if god was mindful of one man's need
[1:02:37] he will leave the throne tonight
[1:02:40] come down from glory
[1:02:43] and meet whatever you have need of
[1:02:45] it don't matter what it is
[1:02:48] god's in your boat
[1:02:50] this is a man
[1:02:52] all you got to do is cry out like the
[1:02:54] man from gatteri
[1:02:56] god heard him cry
[1:02:59] now this storm
[1:03:00] is a they call it a layla
[1:03:03] it's a wind that is suddenly whirled
[1:03:04] about upwards and downwards and it's
[1:03:07] said to be a storm it's like a hurricane
[1:03:12] the sea of galilee sits about 600 feet
[1:03:14] below sea level with mountains on both
[1:03:17] sides
[1:03:18] so you got hot air and cold air just
[1:03:21] swirling around and meeting
[1:03:23] and when that happens you have sudden
[1:03:25] storms
[1:03:27] i text brother jason
[1:03:29] he's talking about the weather earlier
[1:03:30] this afternoon
[1:03:32] and i was actually looking at this
[1:03:35] and all of a sudden there's a crash of
[1:03:37] thunder
[1:03:38] rain pouring against my house it's like
[1:03:41] where in the world that come from all of
[1:03:43] a sudden
[1:03:44] a storm appeared
[1:03:46] that's what this storm was all of a
[1:03:48] sudden you'll be able to see a gallery
[1:03:49] all cleared all of a sudden the storm up
[1:03:50] here

[1:03:59] you might be healthy
[1:04:03] i don't want to say this
[1:04:06] you might even have your bills being
[1:04:08] paid on time

[1:04:18] there's a storm of brewing
[1:04:21] we got to be ready
[1:04:23] we got to be ready to call on jesus
[1:04:25] because there's a man in your boat
[1:04:27] brother charles
[1:04:29] but satan was mad
[1:04:32] he was a mad dude
[1:04:34] after a while jesus exposed him through
[1:04:36] the parables of the sower the seed he
[1:04:38] just told right before this telling who
[1:04:40] that sower the evil seed was
[1:04:43] and then cast him out of people he's
[1:04:45] pretty mad now he knows where jesus was
[1:04:46] going
[1:04:48] he had a man over named legion that had
[1:04:50] 2 000 demons on him
[1:04:53] he was going to try to stop jesus and
[1:04:55] everybody's in that boat
[1:04:58] but he couldn't
[1:05:00] satan said i have i have him and all his
[1:05:01] preachers in one little boat
[1:05:03] i'm going to sink them he's i can't let
[1:05:05] me across that water because if they do
[1:05:08] a maniac was going to be delivered
[1:05:10] he knowed
[1:05:12] he knowed he's going that that may not
[1:05:14] be delivered if jesus ever made it to
[1:05:16] him
[1:05:17] that devil may have tried to stop you
[1:05:19] from coming tonight
[1:05:21] he may have tried to put weather on this
[1:05:23] place to try to stop it
[1:05:25] we're here
[1:05:27] it don't matter what you faced you're
[1:05:29] here
[1:05:30] you have arrived
[1:05:31] hallelujah
[1:05:33] the devil may have tried to stop you
[1:05:35] because he knows if you do
[1:05:37] you'll be set free
[1:05:39] hallelujah he tried to sink that boat
[1:05:41] disciples got scared
[1:05:43] they had forgotten
[1:05:45] who was asleep in the boat
[1:05:48] they had forgotten what jesus had told
[1:05:50] them
[1:05:51] get in the boat we're going to the other
[1:05:53] side
[1:05:54] they forgot all about that during this
[1:05:55] storm
[1:05:57] when a storm hits you don't forget it
[1:06:00] jesus says we're going to the other side
[1:06:02] hallelujah be ready
[1:06:05] they had lost their faith they'd
[1:06:07] forgotten the creator
[1:06:08] was asleep
[1:06:10] in the boat
[1:06:12] creator might be sleeping in your boat
[1:06:14] tonight
[1:06:15] like i said a little bit ago things
[1:06:16] might be going good
[1:06:19] but when the ways all you got to do is
[1:06:21] cry out to jesus
[1:06:23] the storm was a raging
[1:06:25] psalms 89 said doubt rules the raging of
[1:06:28] the sea and when the waves thereof rise
[1:06:30] doubt stealest them
[1:06:33] the storms were rages the disciples
[1:06:35] forgot who they had in the boat
[1:06:37] the same one they seen heal the sick
[1:06:40] the same one they seen raise a dead boy
[1:06:43] the one that seemed working all kinds of
[1:06:45] miracles they had forgotten that
[1:06:49] all they had all they could recognize
[1:06:51] they had the remedy right there in the
[1:06:53] boat
[1:06:54] that's who this person was a remedy for
[1:06:57] every storm a remedy for everything
[1:07:00] i know i did this a few months ago but i
[1:07:02] love this definition of remedy
[1:07:04] i'm here just refresh your memory anyway
[1:07:06] definition
[1:07:08] it's a medicine
[1:07:09] an application
[1:07:11] a treatment that relieves or cure
[1:07:12] disease something that corrects it or
[1:07:16] counteracts
[1:07:19] the legal means to recover a right or
[1:07:21] prevent
[1:07:23] obtain redress for a wrong to cure
[1:07:26] relieve or heal
[1:07:30] to restore it back to your natural
[1:07:34] or proper condition
[1:07:37] oh this jesus is here to restore us back
[1:07:40] to what we were before the foundation of
[1:07:43] the world
[1:07:44] i believe he already has
[1:07:46] the soul
[1:07:48] he's returned this back
[1:07:50] he's gonna restore you back to where you
[1:07:51] were at the beginning though a thought
[1:07:53] in god's mind
[1:07:55] predestinated seed of almighty god
[1:07:58] he's the remedy for the new birth
[1:08:00] that's who jesus is
[1:08:02] hallelujah
[1:08:04] verse 38 he was in the hinder part of
[1:08:06] the boat
[1:08:08] asleep on a pillow and they awaken
[1:08:11] and said unto him master
[1:08:13] carousel not that we perish
[1:08:17] now the sudden they decide they're going
[1:08:18] to call on him
[1:08:25] hallelujah
[1:08:28] they tried to do everything themselves
[1:08:29] with the storm hit
[1:08:31] no doubt they had their buckets out
[1:08:33] getting the water out
[1:08:35] getting the water out
[1:08:37] i was they just realized
[1:08:39] i can't do this
[1:08:41] i can't do this on my own
[1:08:44] i'm going to see peter probably if i
[1:08:45] look over john says hey bro
[1:08:48] we can't do this
[1:08:51] oh hold on a minute there's somebody in

[1:11:13] you've got children's lost
[1:11:17] jesus is here

[1:11:21] hallelujah
[1:11:25] or i don't know what happened to my
[1:11:26] handkerchief oh it's my pocket
[1:11:28] this is who jesus is
[1:11:30] god in the flesh
[1:11:33] he went through everything you went
[1:11:35] through
[1:11:36] everything
[1:11:39] he was tempted by drinking
[1:11:41] he was tempted by women popularity
[1:11:46] hebrews 4 14 seeing that then that we
[1:11:48] have a great high priest that is passed
[1:11:51] into the heavens jesus the son of god
[1:11:54] let us hold fast our profession
[1:11:56] for we have not a high priest
[1:11:59] which cannot be touched by the feeling
[1:12:02] of our infirmities but was in all points
[1:12:05] tempted
[1:12:06] as we are yet without sin
[1:12:11] in that flesh body he wanted to know
[1:12:13] what you felt like
[1:12:15] he won't know what a little baby felt
[1:12:17] like when he burned up with a fever
[1:12:20] that way he could have compassion on
[1:12:21] them
[1:12:22] when you pray god heal my baby
[1:12:25] he knows what it's like
[1:12:28] he knows what it's like to feel alone
[1:12:31] you don't feel like you got a friend in
[1:12:33] the world jesus knows how you feel
[1:12:36] jesus is the best friend any man can
[1:12:38] have
[1:12:41] hallelujah
[1:12:44] jesus even grown with a headache
[1:12:47] i know how that feels
[1:12:49] i get them
[1:12:50] but jesus gives a headache so he can
[1:12:52] heal you
[1:12:55] he got sick so he knows how you feel so
[1:12:57] he can have compassion for you to heal
[1:12:59] you
[1:13:01] when you're tempted god will help you
[1:13:03] through that
[1:13:05] but temptation doesn't come from god
[1:13:07] they come from the devil james 1 13 said
[1:13:10] let no man say when he is tempted
[1:13:12] i am tempted of god
[1:13:14] for god cannot be tempted with evil nor
[1:13:17] tempted he any man
[1:13:19] you're tempted by every man who's drawn
[1:13:22] away on his own lust
[1:13:24] and enticed
[1:13:26] brother i'm saying god in his word god
[1:13:27] doesn't tempt men but god tries men test
[1:13:30] them god cannot tempt you but contest
[1:13:33] you
[1:13:34] and every son that cometh to god must be
[1:13:36] tested and child trained before he can
[1:13:38] be a son
[1:13:40] disciples finally realize
[1:13:42] wake up jesus
[1:13:45] verse 38 again and he said in the inner
[1:13:47] part of this he was in the hinder part
[1:13:49] of the ship asleep on a pill and they
[1:13:51] awake him
[1:13:52] and said master
[1:13:54] don't you care that we perish
[1:13:57] they should see the water coming in
[1:13:58] can't you see the storm's coming in
[1:14:00] we're going to die here jesus
[1:14:07] he was a man
[1:14:09] when he was laying in that ship
[1:14:11] that night so tired that the waves
[1:14:14] were so big they didn't wake him
[1:14:17] i believe ten thousand devils of the sea
[1:14:19] swore to drown him
[1:14:22] the little boat was tossed around like a
[1:14:24] stopper
[1:14:25] a little piece of cork on the water the
[1:14:27] devil says i got him now
[1:14:30] and he was a man laying there asleep
[1:14:32] and when he woke up and put his foot on
[1:14:35] the brow
[1:14:36] of the boat
[1:14:38] looked up towards heaven
[1:14:41] and said peace be still
[1:14:43] and the winds and the ways obeyed him
[1:14:46] that was more than a man
[1:14:48] that was god
[1:14:51] he was a man when he he was hungry
[1:14:54] give me something to eat

[1:14:57] loaves of bread he was god until he took
[1:15:00] those br he was man he took those bread
[1:15:02] he become god and fed five thousand
[1:15:05] he was a man at the well thirsty
[1:15:09] when he told the woman bring me a drink
[1:15:12] he was god when he saved her soul from
[1:15:14] hell
[1:15:16] hallelujah
[1:15:20] he was a man when he stepped up to
[1:15:21] lazarus grave
[1:15:24] weeping
[1:15:26] jesus wept
[1:15:28] but he stood up there and throwed his
[1:15:30] throat his shoulders back
[1:15:32] and said lazarus come forth that was god
[1:15:37] glory to god
[1:15:38] he was a man in the garden of gethsemane
[1:15:42] he was a man when he went got beaten
[1:15:45] he was a man when he crucified him
[1:15:50] oh my word
[1:15:53] he took those beatings for you
[1:15:57] for each one of us
[1:15:58] he took those beatings for you for your
[1:16:00] sin for your sickness for everything you
[1:16:02] go through
[1:16:04] yet he spoke not a word
[1:16:07] that was a man
[1:16:09] he was a man when he said i give up my i
[1:16:11] give i command into my hands i commend
[1:16:13] my spirit
[1:16:15] as a man
[1:16:17] but as god

[1:17:07] he put his foot upon the brow of a boat
[1:17:12] when he arose

[1:20:12] crown
[1:20:13] every billion stars that hung in the
[1:20:15] earth
[1:20:16] every star that's millions of miles
[1:20:19] beyond when they look through that glass
[1:20:22] out yonder
[1:20:23] they could see a hundred and twenty
[1:20:25] million years of life space
[1:20:27] this was brother random
[1:20:29] he said i'll follow that now all those
[1:20:31] billions and billions of stars was his
[1:20:34] crown and he left them
[1:20:38] to take a crown of thorns
[1:20:42] who would do that
[1:20:45] what man would do that
[1:20:49] nobody
[1:20:50] but god did it
[1:20:52] eternal was his robe
[1:20:54] he was rode with eternal life he never
[1:20:57] had a beginning
[1:20:59] and he he didn't start in bethlehem
[1:21:04] he had no beginning
[1:21:05] rolled with eternal life and just pushed
[1:21:07] it aside to take on an old dirty robe of
[1:21:10] earth
[1:21:13] to become human
[1:21:14] for you and i
[1:21:18] this was a man that was in the boat
[1:21:20] that's what manner of man this is
[1:21:23] this is the kind of man that you want in
[1:21:24] your boat
[1:21:26] if you don't have him get him
[1:21:30] there's room
[1:21:33] in john 6 35
[1:21:35] jesus will tell you who he is
[1:21:37] i am the bread
[1:21:39] of life and he that cometh to me
[1:21:42] shall never hunger
[1:21:44] he that believeth on me shall never
[1:21:47] thirst
[1:21:48] and i say unto you that ye also seen me
[1:21:50] and believe not
[1:21:52] talking to him all that the father
[1:21:54] giveth me shall come to me and him that
[1:21:58] cometh to me i will in no wise cast out
[1:22:03] it don't matter
[1:22:05] it don't matter how low down you are
[1:22:09] a lot of us know a lot of us were low
[1:22:11] down
[1:22:13] god stooped all the way down to pick you
[1:22:16] up and he'll do the same thing this
[1:22:18] evening
[1:22:20] he says for i come down from heaven not
[1:22:22] to do my own will but the will of him
[1:22:24] that sent me
[1:22:26] and this is the father's will which has
[1:22:27] sent me of all which he had given me i
[1:22:30] should lose
[1:22:32] nothing
[1:22:34] hallelujah but should raise it again in
[1:22:37] the last day
[1:22:38] and this is the will of him that sent me
[1:22:40] that everyone which saith the son
[1:22:45] are you looking
[1:22:46] and believeth on him may have
[1:22:47] everlasting life and i'll raise him up
[1:22:50] in the last days
[1:22:51] seven times in this book of john where
[1:22:54] jesus said of himself
[1:22:57] jesus knew who he was
[1:23:01] i am
[1:23:03] i am the bread of life
[1:23:05] he told moses who he was
[1:23:09] just telling moses that i am that i am
[1:23:13] the same i am
[1:23:14] that spoke with moses the same i am that
[1:23:17] walk the shores of
[1:23:18] galilee meaning
[1:23:22] not only i am what i am at present but i
[1:23:25] am what i have been i am what i shall be
[1:23:29] and shall be what i am
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:23:33] think about that one for a while
[1:23:36] [Music]
[1:23:37] he was a pillar of fire that led the
[1:23:38] children of israel out of egypt
[1:23:41] this is who's in your boat
[1:23:43] he crossed the sea and the disciples
[1:23:45] have been very weary and he's still to
[1:23:47] see for them crossed all the way over to
[1:23:49] gattera where there was a maniac taking
[1:23:52] the chance of crossing the stormy sea
[1:23:55] where the devils of the sea swore that
[1:23:56] drowning
[1:23:58] but he went over there in a cry of one
[1:24:00] person
[1:24:01] one poor maniac had lost his mind
[1:24:03] perhaps was a good man
[1:24:06] one time walked up right before god
[1:24:09] but probably got in the wrong crowd
[1:24:13] maybe started drinking or something
[1:24:16] lost his mind
[1:24:19] simple as that and now he lives out in
[1:24:21] the tombs
[1:24:23] 2 000 demons on him
[1:24:27] when i couldn't get to him
[1:24:30] he came to me
[1:24:33] you couldn't get to him
[1:24:35] you can't come here and say one day i
[1:24:37] grabbed on the
[1:24:39] hold of these steps of this altar
[1:24:41] and i sought god
[1:24:43] no
[1:24:45] more like god grabbed you and throwed
[1:24:47] you down here at the altar
[1:24:50] i couldn't come to you lord
[1:24:53] but you sure came to me
[1:24:55] and i thank him for it
[1:24:59] hallelujah
[1:25:01] and they mark chapter five verse one
[1:25:06] and they came over to the other side of
[1:25:08] the sea into the country of the
[1:25:09] gatherings
[1:25:10] and when he was come out of the ship
[1:25:12] immediately there met him out of tombs a
[1:25:14] man with an unclean spirit
[1:25:16] who had his dwells among the tombs
[1:25:19] and no man could bind him
[1:25:21] not with chains because they had that he
[1:25:24] had been often bound with fetters and
[1:25:25] chains
[1:25:26] and the chains have been plucked asunder
[1:25:28] by him
[1:25:29] how strong is that
[1:25:32] the prophet said he had the man had a
[1:25:34] wife and kids
[1:25:36] but he got hanging around the wrong
[1:25:37] crowd
[1:25:38] got one devil on him
[1:25:42] another one
[1:25:43] another one
[1:25:44] he kept playing around with them
[1:25:50] you imagine what a man would look like
[1:25:51] with 2 000 demons on him
[1:25:56] lord have mercy
[1:25:59] that devil's a real being
[1:26:00] he'll like nothing better than to
[1:26:02] destroy you
[1:26:04] listen young people
[1:26:06] he'll lock at nothing better to destroy
[1:26:08] you
[1:26:10] don't let him
[1:26:11] [Music]
[1:26:13] he sees what you make in the mood of god
[1:26:14] he'll try to discourage you
[1:26:17] but don't let him
[1:26:20] put a muzzle on him
[1:26:23] oh but every now and then this man would
[1:26:24] come to himself
[1:26:26] and cry out for help
[1:26:28] and those demons would take over
[1:26:31] no doubt it's probably this moment
[1:26:33] that he came to himself that jesus had
[1:26:35] hurt him
[1:26:36] i got to get to him
[1:26:39] he would be naked and running around the
[1:26:40] tombs
[1:26:43] that's what happened when demons get on
[1:26:44] you
[1:26:47] makes me
[1:26:48] wonder what's on these people is running
[1:26:51] around these streets naked
[1:26:54] they got demons on them
[1:26:58] if a man
[1:27:00] it was so possessed
[1:27:02] could break chains
[1:27:05] what can a man do
[1:27:08] that's filled with a holy ghost
[1:27:11] what kind of power lives inside of you
[1:27:15] there's more power
[1:27:16] living in you than they were on him two
[1:27:18] thousand demons
[1:27:21] bruh said if a man possessed with an
[1:27:23] evil spirit could break chains
[1:27:25] what can he do if he was completely
[1:27:27] surrendered to god
[1:27:29] with the power of god possessing him
[1:27:31] like that he could straighten every
[1:27:33] crippled leg
[1:27:35] he would do great things if he could
[1:27:37] just be so anointed with god's power
[1:27:42] god let me be anointed with that power
[1:27:47] did you notice the devil was so
[1:27:49] completely ahold of that man until he
[1:27:52] even confessed jesus
[1:27:56] oh my
[1:27:57] we know who you are holy one of god
[1:28:00] who cometh to torment us before our time
[1:28:05] but if we get so completely surrendered
[1:28:08] god till he can use your tongue
[1:28:11] to speak in other languages to preach
[1:28:14] the gospel to sing the gospel to speak
[1:28:17] with visions
[1:28:18] that we're looking at and the mysteries
[1:28:20] of god if we just completely surrender
[1:28:22] to the power of god
[1:28:26] and if the devil can get a manner his
[1:28:28] control and do that what can god do
[1:28:31] with one
[1:28:33] under his control
[1:28:37] my goodness
[1:28:40] verse five always day and night he was
[1:28:42] in the mountains and the tombs and
[1:28:43] crying and cutting himself with stones
[1:28:46] and when jesus saw when he saw jesus
[1:28:48] afar off he ran and worshiped him
[1:28:53] he'll make the devil worship him
[1:28:56] every day is going to bow
[1:28:59] every tongue is going to confess
[1:29:02] that jesus christ is lord
[1:29:06] oh the devil pleasers one god
[1:29:09] they believe in tremble
[1:29:12] and they confess that jesus of nazareth
[1:29:14] who was born of the virgin according to
[1:29:15] human nature as the son of god according
[1:29:17] to the divine nature
[1:29:20] wow where'd i get that at i'm gonna read
[1:29:22] that again the devils believe there is
[1:29:25] one god and tremble at him and they
[1:29:27] confess that jesus of nazareth who was
[1:29:30] born of a virgin according to the human
[1:29:32] nature is the son of god according to
[1:29:36] his divine nature
[1:29:39] and cried out with a loud voice
[1:29:41] what have i do to thee jesus
[1:29:45] thou son of the most high god
[1:29:49] amen
[1:29:50] i jersey by god don't torment me
[1:29:54] the demons recognized
[1:29:56] who jesus was in other versions of this
[1:29:59] they said have you come to torment us
[1:30:01] before our time
[1:30:04] they've read the back of the book
[1:30:07] they know what happened
[1:30:10] don't destroy us before our time
[1:30:15] and when jesus told the storms peace be
[1:30:17] still
[1:30:18] the disciples were slow to recognize the
[1:30:20] sonship of god
[1:30:22] disciples wondered what kind of man this
[1:30:24] is
[1:30:25] the devil even seeing jesus walking up
[1:30:27] out of the boat up on the shore
[1:30:29] knew exactly who he was
[1:30:32] it didn't take him long
[1:30:34] the devils recognized him
[1:30:37] that was recognized him that he was
[1:30:39] jesus that threw him out
[1:30:41] that threw lucifer out of heaven
[1:30:45] he wanted to be like the most high
[1:30:49] leave us alone luke's version
[1:30:51] what have we do with these thou jesus of
[1:30:53] nazareth or thou come destroy us i know
[1:30:55] thee
[1:30:57] who thou art
[1:30:58] the holy one of god
[1:31:02] recognize who he is
[1:31:05] hallelujah
[1:31:07] the devils believe in tremble
[1:31:10] the demons also recognize jesus as the
[1:31:12] one who someday will judge and punish
[1:31:14] them
[1:31:17] mark 5 8 for he said unto them come out
[1:31:19] of a man thou unclean spirit and when he
[1:31:22] asked him what is thy name he answered
[1:31:24] my name as legion for we are many
[1:31:27] so jesus wasn't talking to the man
[1:31:29] himself
[1:31:30] the man couldn't tell him who his name
[1:31:32] was
[1:31:33] but the devil spoke out of him
[1:31:36] i'm legion
[1:31:38] there's two thousand of me in here
[1:31:42] no doubt jesus probably just laughed at
[1:31:43] him
[1:31:45] really that's all
[1:31:48] two hundred thousand demons been
[1:31:50] released out of the river euphrates upon
[1:31:51] this bride
[1:31:53] is that all
[1:31:56] you got jesus in your boat is that all
[1:31:59] why shouldn't you worry
[1:32:02] we have nothing to fear from that devil
[1:32:05] i might be like brother matthew i might
[1:32:07] wake up in the morning with a with a
[1:32:09] infection
[1:32:10] that's why he preached on sunday or done
[1:32:13] sunday school
[1:32:15] who cares
[1:32:16] i ain't gonna fear no devil
[1:32:20] he's under our feet
[1:32:22] hallelujah
[1:32:24] that's what happens when we get full of
[1:32:25] the devil
[1:32:27] the devil controls you he'll tell you
[1:32:28] where you're going
[1:32:30] oh you're going to go over here you're
[1:32:31] going to drink this much you're going to
[1:32:33] smoke this much
[1:32:35] you're going to boogie woogie all the
[1:32:36] things you want to do
[1:32:38] that's what devil does he's got to
[1:32:39] control your body
[1:32:41] what happens when jesus gets control
[1:32:46] i'm standing right here
[1:32:49] what do you
[1:32:50] what are you going to do with jesus
[1:32:52] control your body you might speak in
[1:32:54] tongues
[1:32:55] you might you might run around the
[1:32:57] building
[1:32:59] you might start stomping around
[1:33:02] how many be willing to do it
[1:33:07] brother aaron get up
[1:33:10] start stomping the devil that's what
[1:33:13] my brother jason let's do it jericho
[1:33:14] march
[1:33:16] let's show the dad we're afraid of no
[1:33:17] emotion
[1:33:19] it ain't about emotion
[1:33:20] we'll get up running around with the
[1:33:21] best wrestlings
[1:33:23] but we'll sit here and cry what can god
[1:33:25] do with you with your under the power of
[1:33:27] the holy ghost
[1:33:29] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:33:31] they shall recover
[1:33:34] not might they shall recover
[1:33:39] mercy
[1:33:41] i'm feeling good
[1:33:43] i'm skipping don't worry
[1:33:46] revelation 23 tells us what happens
[1:33:48] it's a bomb was pit
[1:33:50] so the devils know where they're going
[1:33:53] and i saw an angel come down from heaven
[1:33:54] having the key in the bottomless pit and
[1:33:55] a great chain in his hand and he laid
[1:33:57] hold on the dragon
[1:33:59] the old serpent the devil
[1:34:02] satan
[1:34:03] he's going to call him everything
[1:34:05] he's a dragon he's a serpent he's a
[1:34:07] devil he's satan bound him for a
[1:34:09] thousand years
[1:34:11] and cast him into the bottomless pit and
[1:34:13] shut him up
[1:34:22] that's later
[1:34:24] isaiah god tells lucifer where he's
[1:34:26] going
[1:34:28] you're going to the bombest pit
[1:34:30] you want to be exalted but i'm going to
[1:34:32] put you down
[1:34:33] you're going all the way down
[1:34:35] recognize who you who's living in your
[1:34:37] boat
[1:34:40] you might be a little boat
[1:34:42] you might be a
[1:34:44] big boat
[1:34:47] but god's in it
[1:34:49] it don't matter
[1:34:52] my rebrand said notice when that man
[1:34:54] that maniac was so completely
[1:34:55] surrendered to god
[1:34:59] surrender to say i'm sorry satan used
[1:35:01] his tongue and said we're legion she
[1:35:02] said who are you and the man couldn't
[1:35:04] speak himself satan spoke through him we
[1:35:06] are legions for we are many
[1:35:09] jesus just simply said hold your peace
[1:35:12] and come out of him
[1:35:14] and when the maniac was healed
[1:35:16] the devil said the devil says
[1:35:19] well don't send us back
[1:35:21] to the abyss
[1:35:23] we still have a few more people we want
[1:35:25] to torment
[1:35:29] they knew it wasn't their time
[1:35:31] to be destroyed
[1:35:33] but let us go into the hogs
[1:35:37] that's what we used to be
[1:35:39] we used to be running around like a
[1:35:40] bunch of hogs
[1:35:45] that'll be good
[1:35:47] and there was nine to the mountains a
[1:35:48] great herd of swine feeding
[1:35:51] and all the devils besought him saying
[1:35:54] send us into the swine that we may enter
[1:35:56] them
[1:35:58] and for with jesus gave them leave and
[1:36:00] the unclean spirits went out
[1:36:03] and entered into the swine and the herd
[1:36:05] ran violently down a steep hill steep
[1:36:08] place into the sea
[1:36:10] they're about two thousand
[1:36:13] and we're choked in the sea
[1:36:16] the devil's helpless unless he has a
[1:36:18] body
[1:36:19] to work
[1:36:22] in i think the hogs have more sense than
[1:36:25] some of us has got
[1:36:28] some of us will hard harvest
[1:36:30] a demon of addiction
[1:36:32] no matter what it is
[1:36:34] don't matter what it is
[1:36:37] we won't get rid of it
[1:36:40] at least the hogs had systems that jump
[1:36:41] off a cliff and kill themselves i'm not
[1:36:43] saying go jump off those cliffs
[1:36:46] but there's a way we can get rid of the
[1:36:48] devil
[1:36:52] don't jump off the cliff just jump on
[1:36:53] rock jesus
[1:36:56] that'll take care of everything
[1:36:58] whatever demon it is it don't care if
[1:37:00] it's rock and roll i don't care if it's
[1:37:02] alcohol or cigarettes or pornography or
[1:37:04] country music or christian rock or
[1:37:07] whatever demon is on you
[1:37:10] step up on jesus
[1:37:13] you say why you say the bad ones well go
[1:37:15] say gossip
[1:37:18] do anything contrary to god's word
[1:37:20] step on jesus it's all a devil
[1:37:23] and when the and there that fed the
[1:37:25] swine told in the city in the country
[1:37:27] they went out to see what was done
[1:37:29] and they come to jesus
[1:37:31] we don't want you here
[1:37:37] you're nothing but trouble
[1:37:40] you just our livelihood just drowned in
[1:37:42] the sea
[1:37:44] maybe they wanted what was on them hogs
[1:37:48] those demons could have easily left left
[1:37:50] legion and went right to them people
[1:37:52] they didn't think of that did they
[1:37:55] jesus he'll leave if he's not invited
[1:37:57] he'll go
[1:38:01] that's what i have when jesus comes on
[1:38:02] scene to get we get our right mind
[1:38:06] jesus comes in your boat you'll get in
[1:38:07] your right mind
[1:38:09] you'll clean up
[1:38:13] you'll put your clothes
[1:38:14] on you kick out your televisions
[1:38:25] think about it
[1:38:28] kick out your televisions
[1:38:33] it ain't the big screen you got in your
[1:38:35] room
[1:38:37] it's these little bitty ones right here
[1:38:41] that nobody knows what you look at
[1:38:45] in the stillness of the night
[1:38:50] kick them out
[1:38:52] somebody knows
[1:38:55] verse 16
[1:38:56] and when they saw it told them how it
[1:38:59] fell to him who was possessed with the
[1:39:00] devil and also conservative swine they
[1:39:01] begin to pray get out of here
[1:39:04] leave our coast we don't want you here
[1:39:06] you won't know how powerful god is
[1:39:09] in the book of luke it tells us how
[1:39:11] powerful our god is
[1:39:14] and what god does to the devil
[1:39:16] luke 11 20
[1:39:18] but if i
[1:39:20] with the finger of god
[1:39:24] cast out devils
[1:39:26] no doubt the kingdom of god is come upon
[1:39:29] you
[1:39:33] the finger denotes power
[1:39:36] that's how puny the devil is tonight
[1:39:41] one finger god can cast out a devil
[1:39:48] hallelujah
[1:39:49] just think about it
[1:39:51] what little devil's bothering you
[1:39:54] he ain't no bigger than a little fly
[1:39:57] a little flea
[1:40:00] what do you do with a finger when you
[1:40:00] got a little bug on your desk
[1:40:03] just flip it
[1:40:06] you got a demon of sickness
[1:40:10] demon of lust
[1:40:12] whatever it is
[1:40:14] just flip it

[1:40:20] one finger i could cast out a devil

[1:40:29] yeah i did
[1:40:31] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:40:33] they shall

[1:40:38] we're going to say he was cast out evil
[1:40:39] spirits and heal the sick and jesus said
[1:40:42] they said you're blaspheming because
[1:40:44] they say he has a devil
[1:40:46] when he was healed and sick
[1:40:48] how can satan cast out satan
[1:40:51] if satan cast out satan his kingdom
[1:40:54] his kingdom's just
[1:40:56] but he said if i cast out satan we're to
[1:40:58] know it's by the finger of god
[1:41:02] i've seen satan cast out by a finger
[1:41:04] before
[1:41:07] come out of the boy
