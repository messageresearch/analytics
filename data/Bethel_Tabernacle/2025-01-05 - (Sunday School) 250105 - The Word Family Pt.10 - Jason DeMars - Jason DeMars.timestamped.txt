[0:01] let's pray Heavenly Father we come
[0:03] before you Lord and we want to just
[0:05] Commit This Time in Sunday school to you
[0:07] Lord may your hand be upon each one of
[0:10] us Lord speaking to us leading us
[0:13] teaching us Lord May our hearts be open
[0:16] to the word Lord and may your your life
[0:19] and your anointing flow through us we
[0:20] thank you for these things in Jesus name
[0:23] amen we're going to go ahead and continu
[0:26] Us Part 10 of a word family we're going
[0:28] to look at Genesis chapter 3 read verse
[0:35] 16 unto the woman he said I will greatly
[0:38] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[0:42] in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth
[0:44] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[0:46] husband and he shall rule over thee amen
[0:49] may the Lord add the blessing to the
[0:50] reading of his word you can go ahead and
[0:52] be
[0:56] seated so as we begin to as we've read
[1:00] before and as you read through the Book
[1:03] of Proverbs you find uh throughout it
[1:06] that sons are encourage to listen to the
[1:09] teaching of their
[1:12] mother and of course daughters should as
[1:14] well not just Sons but in in Proverbs
[1:18] it's written to the son a son and so
[1:22] they're encouraged listen to the
[1:23] teaching of your mother hold it in your
[1:26] hearts and we find even that wisdom is
[1:28] personified
[1:30] as a female a Godly woman of
[1:34] wisdom amen the Bible says she cries out
[1:37] in the streets wisdom lady wisdom cries
[1:40] out in the streets and those gathered in
[1:42] the city Gates and calls calls to the
[1:45] simple ones to listen to her advice and
[1:49] correction amen now it's not encouraging
[1:53] The Godly woman to be a Street
[1:55] Preacher but that the wisdom that's
[1:58] taught within the home
[2:00] then is to be applied on the streets so
[2:03] that when you're on the streets you've
[2:05] been taught you've been established in
[2:07] the word then when you're out on the
[2:09] street when you're in public life you
[2:12] know how to behave and and and act
[2:15] because you've had a mother that's
[2:17] instructed you and taught you in
[2:19] wisdom amen Proverbs on the other side
[2:23] Proverbs also advises young men to stay
[2:25] away from a seductive and promiscuous
[2:28] woman don't listen to her words
[2:30] don't stop to speak with her and never
[2:33] enter into her house this is the
[2:35] continual instruction of the Book of
[2:40] Proverbs so young men be advised by The
[2:44] Book of Proverbs look for character
[2:47] isn't that what the prophet taught us
[2:50] your first and foremost thing is to look
[2:51] for character because that is the home
[2:53] that you're going to
[2:55] establish and you may you may say I
[2:58] never want to establish a home I never
[2:59] want to get married sorry you're going
[3:01] to establish a home anyways because
[3:03] you're going to live somewhere you're
[3:05] going to have a lifestyle you're going
[3:06] to have a certain type of life and and
[3:09] what you what you let allow to come into
[3:13] your heart and come into your mind
[3:14] that's the life that you're going to
[3:16] live and so if you you eventually let
[3:19] yourself in with one of these ungodly
[3:22] women out that are looking that are
[3:25] focused on the outward that are thinking
[3:27] about the outward and they're wanting to
[3:29] use the outward to and snare a man
[3:33] that's the type of life that you're
[3:35] building that's the type of type of home
[3:38] you're
[3:39] establishing
[3:42] amen though the lips of a wicked woman
[3:44] are sweet as honey in the end Proverbs
[3:47] tells us it's bitter as poison and
[3:51] dangerous as a double-edged sword amen
[3:54] she says she leads you to the Grave
[3:57] ultimate ultimately it's to Le leading
[4:01] to death stay away from the ungodly
[4:05] immodest girl or woman don't stop in the
[4:09] streets don't don't say oh I'm going to
[4:12] look not just in the streets now on the
[4:14] internet don't stop and look don't stop
[4:17] and stare don't let it come into your
[4:19] heart why because it's poison you're
[4:22] drinking poison you can't drink poison
[4:24] and not have ultimate results you might
[4:28] not immediately die but what it's what
[4:30] is it going to do just like when you
[4:32] feed your body with processed food
[4:34] continuously what are you going to have
[4:36] you're going to be unhealthy you're
[4:37] going to have sickness you're going to
[4:39] have disease just like we have in our
[4:42] society today going everywhere so you
[4:46] might drink the poison that doesn't kill
[4:48] you immediately but it's going to build
[4:49] a life on the foundation of
[4:53] poison amen the Bible says don't drink
[4:57] poison It also says drink water
[5:00] from your own well share love only with
[5:04] your wife that's the only place that
[5:06] it's undefiled and that it's pure not
[5:09] with strangers from the streets or
[5:11] strangers from the internet ultimately
[5:14] This Will Destroy and bring down a man
[5:17] so you see the picture that the Bible is
[5:19] painting you can bring a woman into your
[5:21] life and she can build you up and help
[5:25] establish your life based upon
[5:28] wisdom all right of course a man is to
[5:31] be a leader but
[5:33] nevertheless the atmosphere that you
[5:35] have in your home is also going to be
[5:37] based not just on your leadership but on
[5:40] the leadership that's
[5:42] received from the husband to the wife
[5:46] the atmosphere that's created there so
[5:48] if you want to build your house right
[5:49] seek a woman of
[5:53] wisdom not that doesn't mean you have to
[5:56] seek a woman who has a college degree
[5:58] what is wisdom wisdom is the revelation
[6:01] of the word applied to your life so seek
[6:04] a woman whose life is built upon the
[6:06] revelation of the word and as a woman
[6:09] seek to be a woman whose life is built
[6:12] upon the revelation of the word that is
[6:15] what wisdom
[6:16] is amen the Bible says now now that you
[6:21] have found the right thing it says let
[6:24] let your wife be a fountain of blessing
[6:26] for you and rejoice in the wife of your
[6:29] youth says to always be Capt captivated
[6:34] by her
[6:35] love right that's from a Godly woman a
[6:39] Godly husband and a Godly wife are to
[6:43] produce Godly
[6:46] fruit all right now but the immoral wife
[6:52] immoral wife what does the bible
[6:53] presented her as she's Brash Brash she's
[6:57] rebellious she's never content to stay
[6:59] at home she's always in the streets and
[7:02] Marcus markets and flirting with men
[7:04] everywhere now she's on the internet
[7:07] trying to uh put herself out for
[7:11] everyone else besides what's what where
[7:13] where is she supposed to
[7:17] be all right now we can get the
[7:20] PowerPoint going see
[7:23] here so as we read Genesis 3:16 I'm
[7:26] going to go ahead and look at it in the
[7:29] uh in LT then he said to the woman I
[7:31] will sharpen the pain of your pregnancy
[7:33] and in pain you will give birth and you
[7:36] will desire to control your husband but
[7:39] he will rule over you so so as we've
[7:43] established before God's original
[7:45] intention in creation was he made man
[7:47] first and he put him in the position of
[7:51] leadership he gave adam the authority to
[7:54] name his wife two different
[7:56] times and he gave adam the word to pass
[7:59] on to his wife and when Eve sinned when
[8:03] they both
[8:04] sinned he he said he didn't go to Eve
[8:07] and say what did your husband do he went
[8:09] to Adam and say what what have you done
[8:12] did you do what I told you not to do so
[8:16] the fall then produces this is the curse
[8:20] upon the
[8:21] woman so what is her desire now her
[8:23] desire is not to submit to her husband
[8:26] the sinful desire of of women is to
[8:30] overpower her husband and to usurp the
[8:34] authority of men so we could see then
[8:35] feminism itself is a result of the fall
[8:40] and of sin and of evil but then on the
[8:43] other side is you have he will rule over
[8:46] you and if you look at this verse it's
[8:48] speaking he will dominate over you so a
[8:50] man's desire is to rule as a dictator
[8:54] sinful desire is to rule as a dictator
[8:57] to manipulate and control his wife and
[8:59] his wife on the other side her desire is
[9:02] to manipulate and control her husband
[9:05] and this is a perversion of the word
[9:09] Proverbs 14:1 says every wise woman
[9:12] builds her house but the foolish plucks
[9:14] it down with her hands so a wise woman
[9:19] her through her behavior how she treats
[9:21] her husband how she manages her home how
[9:25] she builds her life what does she do he
[9:27] she builds up her own house she she
[9:30] encourages them she strengthens them but
[9:32] a foolish woman what does she do she
[9:35] she's nagging she's controlling she's
[9:38] beating everybody down to the point
[9:40] where they they they just want to run
[9:42] from her that's why you have all these
[9:45] funny uh uh Tik toks and and reals and
[9:50] the men are finding ways they they're
[9:51] going to the Home Depot they can't wait
[9:53] to get to the Home Depot they're getting
[9:55] in their truck they spend 16 hours in
[9:57] their truck avoiding their family
[9:59] avoiding their wife that's not the
[10:01] atmosphere that a woman should be
[10:03] creating when her husband gets home that
[10:06] should be the place that's his Oasis not
[10:08] the place where oh Lord have mercy here
[10:11] it comes
[10:12] again that's not the atmosphere that God
[10:15] wants to
[10:17] have in a home Proverbs 11 verse 22 as a
[10:24] jewel of gold in a swine snout so is a
[10:27] fair woman with which is without
[10:30] discretion it's quite a statement but
[10:33] God wants a woman to have discretion she
[10:35] wants to have her her to have
[10:38] discernment to understand what to let
[10:41] near her what kind of how to how to
[10:43] speak how to act how to behave how to
[10:46] order herself according to the word it's
[10:50] not saying that a fair woman is de facto
[10:54] evil right brother brandom says you're
[10:56] supposed to use your beauty to further
[10:58] the king of God right not to further
[11:02] selfish ends and to lead men to
[11:07] destruction Proverbs 21:9 it's better to
[11:10] dwell in a corner of the Housetop than
[11:13] with a brawling woman in a wide
[11:18] house verse 19 it's better to dwell in
[11:21] the wilderness than with a contentious
[11:24] and an angry
[11:26] woman it's better to dwell in the Cor
[11:29] corner of the Housetop and with a
[11:31] brawling woman in a wide house three
[11:33] times Proverbs repeats this so three
[11:37] times is like a an
[11:39] emphasis if if it repeats it twice it's
[11:42] emphasizing it if it repeats it three
[11:45] times now it's like saying hey pay
[11:47] attention we're shouting here now it's
[11:50] better to live alone in the wilderness
[11:52] in the corner of a rooftop in a tiny
[11:54] little home it's better to be alone is
[11:57] what it's saying so in this in in gen
[11:59] Genesis it says it's not good for a man
[12:01] to be alone but if he gets himself the
[12:03] wrong type of wife that's brawling and
[12:06] contentious and fighting and nagging
[12:08] better for him to be alone is
[12:10] essentially what uh Solomon is telling
[12:13] us let's
[12:15] let's again again we this is kind of
[12:18] marriage
[12:19] 101 every Christian owes their full
[12:23] allegiance to
[12:25] Christ we owe full obedience to Christ
[12:29] not full obedience to Christ if you're
[12:31] under a good
[12:33] pastor if you're in a positive church if
[12:36] everything is going your way then you
[12:38] owe full obedience to Christ no you full
[12:41] owe full obedience to Christ even if you
[12:44] have the worst Pastor in the
[12:46] world even if you have a manipulative
[12:48] and controlling Pastor even if you have
[12:50] a horrible husband even if you have a
[12:53] horrible wife even if your entire life
[12:56] is falling apart right in front of your
[12:58] eyes
[13:00] God doesn't say okay now now you your
[13:03] whole life is falling apart so go ahead
[13:05] and be disobedient and wicked and
[13:09] angry that's not what the word says so
[13:12] if you have a perfect wife then you can
[13:15] be a good man if you have a perfect
[13:17] husband then you can be a good woman
[13:20] no if you have if you have a a horrible
[13:24] spouse God wants you to walk and live
[13:27] with the right spirit and in obedience
[13:31] it won't be easy but the holy spirit is
[13:34] there to help you to walk in
[13:38] obedience Proverbs
[13:41] 27:15 a continual dropping in a very
[13:44] rainy day and a con contentious woman
[13:46] are alike whosoever hides her hides the
[13:51] wind and the ointment of his right hand
[13:54] which berth
[13:57] itself so what in the world does that
[13:59] mean let's look at the NLT to help us
[14:02] stopping her complaints is like trying
[14:03] to stop the wind or trying to hold
[14:06] something with greased
[14:09] hands so that that is a contentious
[14:15] woman you're not going to you're not
[14:17] going to close her
[14:19] mouth and you're not going to force her
[14:21] to stop she's going to continuously be
[14:23] like that now again we talked about I
[14:26] talked about that before a woman many
[14:29] times is a reflection of her
[14:31] husband so if she is reflecting back to
[14:34] you if by all accounts and purposes your
[14:37] wife is
[14:40] normally a Godly woman and suddenly
[14:43] she's the most frustrating woman you've
[14:45] ever experienced you might want to look
[14:48] in the
[14:49] mirror now if you married her and she
[14:51] was always orary like that that's your
[14:54] that's your issue but if she normally is
[14:58] doing all right
[15:00] it's a pretty good wife and suddenly
[15:02] there's a change it's probably something
[15:04] to do with the
[15:06] mirror it's probably the type of
[15:08] leadership the type of attitude the type
[15:10] of approach that's and she's just
[15:12] reflecting some or right back at
[15:16] you amen because as we said before the
[15:21] the man is the glory of God and the
[15:24] woman is the image and glory of the man
[15:28] so the man is the reflected glory of God
[15:31] the woman is the reflected glory of the
[15:33] man so she is reflecting back she's
[15:36] going to reflect the vision that a man
[15:38] has been given by God so he is under God
[15:42] under the headship of Christ he is to
[15:44] channel the vision and heart of Christ
[15:47] to be fully surrendered then she can
[15:49] Channel and uh manifest and reflect what
[15:53] she's supposed to reflect from the
[15:57] man things
[16:00] so we can know for sure things that God
[16:02] doesn't want to see in a woman number
[16:06] one lacking discernment about what is
[16:08] right and wrong number two angry or man
[16:12] manipulative uh behavior that always is
[16:15] ready to argue with her husband and
[16:18] ultimately she's getting in her own
[16:24] way let's look at what brother brandham
[16:26] speaks
[16:30] and now you see a little old man coming
[16:32] down the street and the little Jezebel
[16:34] with a cigarette in her mouth puffing
[16:35] along like that she say well she hollers
[16:38] scat and he jumps through jumps through
[16:42] to the door that's right and at night
[16:43] time she's sitting out there with them
[16:46] pretty red fingernails till it looks
[16:48] like eagle claws and been eating raw
[16:51] beef steak with it standing out there
[16:53] she won't wash the dishes cuz she's
[16:55] afraid the paint will come off while her
[16:57] poor husband is scrubbing the dishes
[16:59] after washing like that and her sitting
[17:02] in there sucking a cigarette and he's
[17:04] taking care of the baby right that's
[17:05] rank isn't it sounds ridiculous but it's
[17:08] the Bible and the truth just exactly
[17:10] right how could you ever eat a pan of
[17:13] biscuits with a woman that made them
[17:14] with that big long fingernails I
[17:16] couldn't I tell you it turn my stomach I
[17:18] just couldn't do it so anyhow but oh my
[17:21] it's all right but you little weakling
[17:24] man I'm ashamed of you as Christians
[17:25] Brothers will let your wife do such a
[17:27] thing as that it shows what you are made
[17:30] of made out of that's
[17:33] right now you women you ought to say
[17:35] amen after fussing at you like that
[17:37] because he's the ruler that's right and
[17:39] the way he let you live it's his fault
[17:41] God's going to hold him responsible for
[17:43] it that's right if you ain't man enough
[17:45] to take up and put your own house in
[17:47] order God be merciful to you that's
[17:49] right because the Bible said in in the
[17:51] very beginning that he shall rule over
[17:54] thee
[17:56] now uh now let's
[18:00] see now she's a she's not a doormat now
[18:03] she's your sweetheart see but you should
[18:05] sit down and talk to her and reason it
[18:07] with her and tell her and read the Bible
[18:10] and pray together these things wouldn't
[18:12] be in the church then if you done that
[18:14] that's right amen as I said before
[18:18] brothers that say well I'm not a teacher
[18:20] I can't teach my family right right
[18:23] here you have to be able to instruct
[18:26] your family it is your duty and your
[18:28] responsib ability as a man to instruct
[18:30] your wife because she's supposed to Inu
[18:33] instruct the children you have to
[18:35] instruct your wife and your CH children
[18:38] and lead them and teach them and show
[18:41] them in the Bible brother bham is not
[18:43] saying now you shame on you men you you
[18:45] need to enforce this in your homes now
[18:48] he's saying beat your family beat your
[18:50] kids manipulate them control them he say
[18:53] no don't do that you sit down with the
[18:56] word and you teach and you teach and you
[18:59] teach and you do it with
[19:02] patience the teacher in the Bible it it
[19:05] makes clear to do it with
[19:09] patience but you don't leave it alone if
[19:12] you have to teach on modesty for 365
[19:15] days in a year to your family then
[19:18] patiently open the Bible open the
[19:22] message and do it we have no
[19:25] excuse and women that aren't dressing
[19:29] modestly shame on
[19:31] you but double shame on your husband
[19:35] because you're supposed to instruct when
[19:37] brother Brandon preaches it so hard and
[19:39] he's shouting and yelling we think
[19:41] suddenly this is how we have to handle
[19:42] it at the
[19:44] home I promise you that's not how
[19:46] brother brandham was dealing with it at
[19:48] his home and the scripture makes it
[19:50] clear if you're a teacher you must do so
[19:54] with patience and Men sorry you didn't
[19:58] know you were signing up to be a teacher
[20:00] when you got married but you
[20:03] were that is your duty to be a teacher
[20:06] of your family and to be instructor it's
[20:08] fantastic that we have good preaching at
[20:10] the pulpit but if husbands aren't
[20:11] leading their home the preaching at the
[20:13] pulpit is not going to do any B any true
[20:16] benefit in the long
[20:19] term because it is supposed to be
[20:21] established and put forth in the home by
[20:25] men so God's purpose is for a woman is
[20:29] she must be
[20:31] wise
[20:32] discreet discreet means to have
[20:35] discernment and judge critically of what
[20:37] is correct and proper as we as we've
[20:40] said multiple times before and as the
[20:43] scripture tells us woman is more easily
[20:45] deceived than a man however we can come
[20:49] and tell you that the gospel brings
[20:53] something different to the hearts of the
[20:55] people what is what is that the elect
[20:58] won't be
[21:00] deceived so especially in this hour that
[21:02] we're living in the Holy Ghost comes
[21:04] upon us that is creating and bringing
[21:08] wisdom and and discernment within the
[21:10] hearts of men and
[21:13] women all right God God's desire for a
[21:18] woman is also to be respectful to be
[21:21] obedient to be quiet and to be
[21:24] meek and these are all these are all not
[21:27] qualities that we are born
[21:30] with the natural man these things are
[21:33] foolishness to
[21:35] him but through the power of the Holy
[21:38] Spirit these qualities through prayer
[21:42] and through through the feeding on the
[21:44] word these qualities and attributes are
[21:47] developed and built within every woman
[21:52] of
[21:56] God see where am I at
[21:59] in the choosing of a bride brother
[22:00] brandham says for me I'd take not the
[22:03] pretty thing up on top the hill I'd take
[22:06] this character down here as you remember
[22:08] the story he's referring to he's
[22:09] referring to the rich couple arguing and
[22:12] fighting and and the poor couple where
[22:16] she loved him with all her heart and he
[22:18] did everything he could to provide and
[22:21] take care of her with all his heart and
[22:22] they loved each other he says I'll take
[22:25] that thing down there as a real
[22:27] Homemaker so somebody that loved me and
[22:29] stayed with me somebody tried to make to
[22:31] make a home and not bleeding you for
[22:34] everything for fineries and somebody
[22:36] that was with you and part of you amen I
[22:40] love that and it shall be even as it was
[22:43] told me he says well everyone thinks
[22:46] about their mother you know I think
[22:48] mother the good true mother is the Fifth
[22:50] Gospel Matthew Mark Luke John mother
[22:53] mother gets them first and that's the
[22:55] one who brings them up first is Mother
[23:01] amen they Little Treasures that God has
[23:04] given you the
[23:05] responsibility of raising and I've
[23:08] always said and made this kind of a
[23:09] saying to mothers we know written of
[23:11] four gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John
[23:13] but there's a Fifth Gospel Unwritten
[23:15] that's mother she gets them before
[23:17] Matthew Mark Luke and John's teaching
[23:19] gets them so the responsibility is
[23:21] placed upon you mothers and you fathers
[23:23] to raise these
[23:24] children for the kingdom kingdom of God
[23:27] and I'm sure that's your heart
[23:30] desire uh
[23:32] again a woman is designed to be under
[23:35] Authority she's to have a Meek Spirit a
[23:39] Meek and quiet spirit is what what the
[23:41] scripture says Meek doesn't mean
[23:43] weakness Meek meekness doesn't mean a
[23:47] lack of faith or a lack of strength what
[23:50] it actually means is willing to be led
[23:53] the C the capability and the willingness
[23:56] to be led just as Moses Moses was strong
[23:59] he was a strong man of
[24:01] God right I mean he he had the
[24:03] capability of murdering a man right that
[24:07] was coming against someone he had the
[24:09] capability of defending the daughters of
[24:13] of Jethro he wasn't weak but what was it
[24:17] he was the meekest of all men which
[24:19] means he was able to be under
[24:22] leadership so a woman is is
[24:25] designed for meekness which means means
[24:28] she's to be under the authority of her
[24:31] father and then her
[24:36] husband I mean if you really I'm gonna
[24:38] have I'm just going to have to quit
[24:41] right there because I'm transitioning
[24:43] into another aspect of this subject of
[24:47] Womanhood and it won't do any good to
[24:50] just get one quote into it so let's
[24:52] stand and
[24:55] pray Heavenly Father we thank you so
[24:57] much for your
[24:59] your love for us Lord we thank you so
[25:01] much
[25:02] for what you're what you're doing within
[25:04] us Lord to conform us unto the image of
[25:09] Christ Lord each one I pray Lord that
[25:12] you would just continue to move and work
[25:15] in our service today Lord May each one
[25:21] musician those
[25:23] playing uh leading songs and preaching
[25:26] Lord each one may we all everyone get
[25:29] out of the way so that you'd be
[25:30] glorified and your people would be built
[25:32] up Lord we commit ourselves to You For
[25:34] Your Glory we ask in Jesus name amen God
[25:37] bless you
