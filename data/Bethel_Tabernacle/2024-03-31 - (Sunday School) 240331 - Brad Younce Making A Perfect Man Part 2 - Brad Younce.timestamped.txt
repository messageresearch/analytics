[1:05] prophets and some evangelists and some
[1:08] pastors and
[1:09] teachers for the perfecting of the
[1:11] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:14] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[1:17] we all come in unity of the faith and of
[1:20] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:22] perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:26] Statue of the fullness of Christ may God
[1:29] has blessings you can have your seats
[1:31] you know for a
[1:32] title it's going to be the making of a
[1:35] perfect man part
[1:36] two you know we know Jesus
[1:39] says and we said this last time we go
[1:42] real quick be ye therefore perfect even
[1:45] as your father which is in heaven is
[1:47] perfect and that word perfect was
[1:50] brought to its end it's finished it
[1:53] means you don't need nothing else
[1:56] everything you have you've already got
[1:58] you don't need your your you're perfect
[2:01] you're wanting nothing necessary to
[2:04] completeness is anyone here at this
[2:06] point in your life are you
[2:09] perfect are you perfect as god is
[2:13] perfect cuz what Jesus says be ye
[2:15] therefore perfect even as our father in
[2:18] Heaven is
[2:20] perfect I want to be
[2:23] perfect you know you come to church this
[2:25] morning before you came to church you
[2:28] put on your best clothes you looked up
[2:30] you looked in the
[2:32] mirror I have reached
[2:35] Perfection brother Caleb did you do that
[2:37] when you looked in the
[2:38] mirror
[2:40] no we've reached the goal there's an
[2:44] ultimate goal that we're we're trying to
[2:45] attain and that go is what we need to
[2:47] obain to be a stature of a perfect man
[2:50] and that definition again was a stature
[2:52] was quality or a status gained by growth
[2:56] a development or an
[2:58] achievement you know when you first get
[3:02] saved and receive the Holy Ghost you're
[3:04] just a little
[3:06] baby you haven't reached your full
[3:08] potential when you get first get saved
[3:10] you're not a full mature
[3:11] bride we're not what we're supposed to
[3:14] be we're not a full mature as as soon as
[3:16] we get saved you know it's like a baby
[3:18] when it's born you know you mothers you
[3:20] bring it out of the hospital you're
[3:22] sitting there carrying it all that sweet
[3:24] little
[3:25] thing what do you do all right you're
[3:29] born you're a human there's the car go
[3:32] walk in it go walk to the car get it and
[3:34] drive it we're going to Dockside for
[3:38] lunch no the baby has to have milk first
[3:42] he can't have dock side to start out
[3:43] with he's got to have milk so the baby's
[3:45] growing it's a it's a a state of growth
[3:48] but you're holding that baby you're
[3:50] going to have to take care of that baby
[3:52] you're going to have to nurture that
[3:54] baby so it's what God's doing to us when
[3:56] we first get saved he nurtures us he
[3:59] sits in Hope Us in his arms you know
[4:01] when you first get saved everything is
[4:02] so easy amen you know what I'm talking
[4:06] about you know that song bring back to
[4:08] New Again you remember how it was you
[4:10] first got saved you listen to every tape
[4:12] you could you read every every book of
[4:15] the Bible you prayed all the
[4:17] time what happened Lord sometimes I want
[4:19] to bring back the new again Lord bring
[4:22] back that feeling that feeling of
[4:25] newness not back we don't want to go
[4:27] back to being a baby in the word but we
[4:28] want that newness that fullness that
[4:30] building I'm talking about a perfect
[4:33] body but you're not going to put that
[4:35] baby down and say all right go walk to
[4:37] the car no you're going to carry that
[4:39] baby to the car that's what happens when
[4:41] we become born again you're like a baby
[4:43] we don't become a full mature bride as
[4:45] soon as we're born again you know you'll
[4:47] look at look at things new when you
[4:50] first get saved you're looking at things
[4:51] it's all new oh man predestination
[4:54] that's a new thing it's like a baby you
[4:56] watch your baby they're all the time
[4:58] looking around and they'll find
[5:00] something they'll sit and stare at it
[5:01] trying to figure out what it is don't
[5:03] look in that light because you can't see
[5:07] nothing I can't even see what I got
[5:09] wrote down here that's what happens when
[5:11] you get born again remember how it used
[5:13] to be when you first got saved but
[5:15] you're carrying this little baby then
[5:16] all of a sudden they're grown up and
[5:18] that sweet little baby has turned into
[5:22] Jackson it's grown it's a man stature a
[5:27] full grown adult of full age a mature
[5:29] bride
[5:30] the making of a perfect man how do we
[5:34] get there I'm going to tell
[5:37] you God has a have the image he has to
[5:41] have an image that he's going to produce
[5:43] it's not going to be brother Brown's
[5:45] image it's not going to be brother
[5:46] Jason's or some great man he's going to
[5:48] be in the image of almighty God God
[5:51] wants us to be perfect so what does he
[5:53] do he don't choose a moral man he
[5:55] chooses one person that was perfect and
[5:57] that was a Jesus Christ that's who who
[5:59] the image were be if God uses a man
[6:01] it'll be a
[6:04] mess but God wants us to be perfect so
[6:07] what does he do so what did he do he
[6:10] came down says I'm going to have have a
[6:12] body born of a virgin I'm going to go to
[6:15] the Cross I'm going to be
[6:18] beaten I'm going to take these Stripes
[6:20] I'm going to die I'm going to go to hell
[6:22] take my take your sins to Hell he's
[6:24] going to raise again on the third day
[6:27] that's the image of a perfect man is
[6:29] Jesus Christ but this image won't come
[6:33] easy making this image won't be easy you
[6:37] can't just say I've got the Holy Ghost
[6:39] I've reached
[6:41] Perfection God says no you haven't now
[6:45] that I've got your soul sealed it's time
[6:47] for testing there's going to be testing
[6:50] and trials that's going to come with it
[6:52] there's going to be molding and
[6:55] beatings we don't like that part of it
[6:57] do we amen BR says you know in the o old
[7:00] time when they used to
[7:02] make gold before they had a smelter to
[7:05] burn it out they used to beat the goat
[7:07] out they beat out the sludge the the
[7:09] iron and the copper and the stuff out
[7:10] they just keep beating and they'll turn
[7:12] it over and keep beating it you said the
[7:15] Indians do that now beating the gold and
[7:18] they beat it you know how they could
[7:19] tell that the iron was out of it and all
[7:23] the dirt and stuff and the Dres out of
[7:25] it when the one that was beating it
[7:28] could see his own reflection
[7:30] like a mirror in it it was clean and
[7:34] clear enough that it reflected the
[7:36] beater that's what God does he takes
[7:39] this gold that he's found in the earth
[7:41] and he beats it by the Holy Spirit
[7:44] turning it over and over and over and
[7:47] beating it until he can see his own
[7:52] reflection and that's what we're
[7:54] supposed to do to reflect the Son of God
[7:57] God look look at me and see yourself
[8:01] that's the making of a perfect man of
[8:02] second
[8:03] Peter chapter 1 verse three according as
[8:08] his divine power hath given unto us all
[8:12] things that pertain unto life and
[8:15] godliness through the knowledge of him
[8:18] that has called us from to glory and
[8:21] virtue whereby are given unto us
[8:25] exceeding
[8:27] great more than great
[8:30] Beyond Great the greatest we can't
[8:33] receive no
[8:34] greater our minds can't even comprehend
[8:37] that whereby are given unto us exceeding
[8:42] great and precious
[8:44] promises we know what precious is it's
[8:47] valuable it's costly esteemed beloved
[8:49] honorable most
[8:52] precious precious promises that by these
[8:56] ye might be
[8:58] partakers
[9:01] partakers which is a partner your
[9:05] associate you're a companion you're a
[9:07] share in everything because we heard
[9:10] brother Jason talk about Wednesday night
[9:12] he says the king in the old days will
[9:14] say I'll give you half of my
[9:17] kingdom it was just half his kingdom he
[9:19] was a share of all of the Kingdom so
[9:22] it's what God has done to us he has
[9:25] given what's you know the king says
[9:27] what's mine is yours you know Sarah
[9:29] always goes around says what's hers is
[9:31] hers and what's yours is mine so
[9:35] everything I have Sarah's
[9:37] got everything God's got it's yours
[9:43] amen partakers you're a
[9:46] partner all that God has it youres we
[9:49] are partakers of God's divine nature and
[9:52] all that he has belongs to us so ye
[9:55] might be partakers of divine nature the
[9:58] nature of God haven't escaped the
[10:01] corruption that is in the world through
[10:03] lust we have escaped the corruption we
[10:07] have permission to escape you know when
[10:08] you're a prisoner you go to jail you
[10:11] ain't getting out they try they try to
[10:14] get out but most the time they ually get
[10:16] caught sometimes they'll get away but we
[10:17] have permission for to break our chains
[10:20] to escape this world of
[10:24] corruption then when you do all of that
[10:27] then you will become part partners with
[10:30] that divine
[10:32] nature and besides this given all
[10:35] diligence
[10:37] speed eagerness be Earnest you need it
[10:42] haste and besides all this give
[10:44] diligence add to your
[10:48] faith add to your faith so he's not
[10:50] saying take your faith and add it to
[10:52] something you got to start somewhere you
[10:55] got to start with your faith your faith
[10:58] is a persuasion a Reliance upon Christ
[11:00] for
[11:02] salvation it's your belief it's your
[11:05] belief in
[11:07] God and and now Faith and Hebrews 11
[11:10] says faith is the substance of things
[11:11] hoped for and the evidence of things not
[11:14] seen you know we can't even please God
[11:16] without faith that's what it says in
[11:17] Hebrews 11 but without faith it is
[11:20] impossible to to please him for he that
[11:24] cometh to God must believe that he is
[11:26] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[11:28] Dil ently seek
[11:31] him there's that word again
[11:34] diligent because faith is a foundation
[11:37] you know there's a process when you go
[11:38] build a house you just don't get a piece
[11:41] of property and see a nice piece of land
[11:44] and throw your a wall on
[11:46] it well Travis it's going to fall over
[11:49] you got to put a foundation in so when
[11:52] when you're building this statue of
[11:53] perfect man you can't say I want
[11:55] brotherly kindness first that seems to
[11:58] be easy I can be kind to to
[12:00] people no you got to start Foundation
[12:03] why is the foundation so big it's got to
[12:06] hold up this man so you got to have
[12:08] perfect Faith the faith of God not not
[12:11] our human faith our human faith that
[12:13] gets us in trouble but we got to have
[12:15] the faith of God you heard that song
[12:17] have faith in God have faith of God so
[12:21] there's there's a
[12:23] process you can't say I'm going to get
[12:25] brother kindness first there's there's
[12:26] an easy one there's an order to build
[12:28] this house
[12:29] you got to put the foundation in first
[12:31] because the house won't stand there's an
[12:34] order we need this foundation and Christ
[12:36] is that foundation so besides this giv
[12:39] all diligence add to your
[12:42] faith so once you got faith you got to
[12:45] add something to it when you get a
[12:47] foundation to the house you just say
[12:49] there's my concrete I'm moving
[12:51] in it's not ready there's things you
[12:55] have to do so you got to put the walls
[12:57] up so you got to get
[13:00] virtue what's virtue you got to have the
[13:03] same virtue that Christ has it's his
[13:06] power you know when Jesus was walking by
[13:08] in the crowd and this woman with the
[13:10] issue of blood reached out and touched
[13:11] the him of His Garment Jesus stops say
[13:14] somebody touch me cuz I felt virtue
[13:16] leave me do we have that kind of virtue
[13:18] when somebody else is in need that they
[13:21] can come to you and you won't sit and
[13:23] make fun of them and drag them down but
[13:25] they can actually draw the strength from
[13:27] you draw strength strength from you
[13:30] amen Jesus says virtue has left me the
[13:34] woman took of his
[13:36] strength
[13:38] hallelujah or do we just look at
[13:40] somebody I don't have time for you but
[13:43] do we have strength that somebody can
[13:44] actually be around you and they leave a
[13:48] better
[13:48] person they said man I I was around I
[13:52] was around brother Travis and when the
[13:54] time I left I was walking on clouds amen
[13:57] Travis has that effect on people
[14:01] if you had talked to Travis talk to him
[14:02] for a
[14:04] while you'll leave our feeling strength
[14:07] that's the
[14:08] virtue that's the virtue you
[14:11] need and add to your faith virtue and to
[14:15] your virtue
[14:17] knowledge know what you're talking about
[14:20] you know what you believe
[14:23] in you got to believe every word
[14:27] knowledge is saying Amen to every word
[14:29] not just the parts that we love but the
[14:31] parts that hurts us some of the parts
[14:33] that cuts us deep that molds
[14:36] us so add to your
[14:41] knowledge add to your knowledge free me
[14:44] from
[14:47] alcohol that ain't what it
[14:49] said Temperance that a't get yourself
[14:52] free from alcohol you should have
[14:53] already been free from alcosol when you
[14:55] got
[14:56] saved Hallelujah
[15:00] I'm getting rid of drinking that's not
[15:01] it you're going to add
[15:04] self-control that's what Temperance is
[15:07] temperance is self-control you don't fly
[15:09] off the handle when somebody pulls out
[15:11] in front of
[15:19] you y temper somebody says something
[15:21] about you you want to get at them let me
[15:23] at them
[15:25] oo Temperance have the temperance of God
[15:29] what do you do when somebody somebody
[15:30] pull out in front of you put on your
[15:33] brakes God bless
[15:36] you preaching to
[15:40] me boy somebody gets your seat you come
[15:43] to church I've been sitting in that seat
[15:45] for
[15:45] years and these people move in and take
[15:48] my
[15:51] chair
[15:55] Temperance God's
[15:57] temperance it's like when he was being
[16:00] beat and that beard plucked out and that
[16:04] whip Bea in his
[16:05] back when he was nailed to the cross he
[16:09] didn't say a word can we do that can we
[16:14] honestly say when people are sitting
[16:16] talking about you or saying awful things
[16:18] and you know it's not
[16:20] true can we just stand there and not say
[16:22] a word amen
[16:25] Temperance
[16:27] temperance
[16:30] and to Temperance patience Lord I want
[16:34] patience and I want it
[16:38] now how many prayed for patience
[16:43] lately you pray for patience you're
[16:45] going to get
[16:46] tested I believe that's the that's the
[16:49] one you get tested on the most is our
[16:51] patience I'm a pretty patient man till I
[16:53] get behind the wheel of a
[16:56] vehicle and then I lose it
[17:00] cuz everybody on the road idiots but
[17:04] me
[17:06] patience God help
[17:09] me patience with each
[17:13] other when somebody does you wrong you
[17:15] got patience for them Lord forgive them
[17:19] they don't know what they do whoa where
[17:21] that where we hear that
[17:23] before when Jesus was on the
[17:26] cross forgive them Lord for they know
[17:29] not what they
[17:30] do he has patience and to your patience
[17:35] godliness amen Pi piety you're devoted
[17:39] to this you have a reverence you're
[17:43] devout it's your duty you're obedient is
[17:47] Holiness is to be like
[17:49] God and to Godless brotherly kindness
[17:53] love of your brothers and sisters kind
[17:56] to one
[17:57] another not just the people you
[18:02] like but those that done you wrong you
[18:06] be kind to amen so you got to add all
[18:10] these together they stick
[18:12] together BR
[18:14] says talk about Jesus he had a gift he
[18:17] knowed all things for in him was the
[18:19] fullness of the godhead bodily they had
[18:22] even seen him perform Miracles by
[18:24] telling people what was wrong with them
[18:26] and so forth they put a rag around his
[18:29] head like that around his eyes and hit
[18:31] him with a stick and said prophesy and
[18:34] tell us who hit you we'll believe you
[18:36] see he had
[18:38] Temperance if you got it like that add
[18:40] it to your faith if you still blow up
[18:43] and Sass and fuss and stew and carry on
[18:47] uhhuh you ain't got
[18:49] it you can't add that cause it won't add
[18:53] it won't vulcanize right amen vulcanize
[18:57] is to treat with so and
[18:59] heat imparting strength and greater
[19:03] elasticity and
[19:06] durability vulcanize you know it sounds
[19:09] like something from Star
[19:13] Trek that's the explation behind this
[19:15] word has more to do with ancient
[19:17] mythology than it does with science
[19:19] fiction it evolved from heating rubber
[19:22] is where this word come from in a
[19:24] combination with
[19:26] sulfur they have they even named it
[19:28] after the Roman god
[19:31] Vulcan
[19:33] oo who was a god of fire and skills that
[19:37] use fire such as metal
[19:39] working so when Charles goodwi goodear
[19:43] discovered that high heat would result
[19:45] in stronger rubber he called the process
[19:49] vulcanization after the god of fire so
[19:53] high heat what's it do it vulcanizers
[19:57] you so if you get high heat you add to
[19:59] your faith virtue it
[20:01] sticks you add your Temperance and
[20:03] patience and godliness and brotherly
[20:05] kindness it sticks it's
[20:08] vulcanized says you can't take a piece
[20:10] of rubber you know and vulcanize to a
[20:12] piece of iron it just won't work it's
[20:14] got to be flexible just like the rubber
[20:17] is so when your faith and your
[20:19] Temperance becomes the same kind of Holy
[20:21] Ghost Temperance that he had that it
[20:24] will vulcanize with him you you're added
[20:27] to it
[20:29] so when your virtue is like his add to
[20:31] it when your knowledge is like his
[20:34] knowledge I come to do thy will oh God
[20:36] see with the father's word he defeated
[20:39] every devil heavens and earth will pass
[20:42] away but the word will not when you're
[20:45] that kind of knowledge it'll vulcanize
[20:47] with your faith and with the right kind
[20:49] of temperance like he had it'll
[20:51] vulcanize if you haven't just a man-made
[20:55] halfway SED up belief or temperance
[20:59] oh I ought to slap him but maybe I
[21:02] better not cuz they might put my name in
[21:05] the
[21:06] paper that ain't that kind of temper
[21:08] he's talking about don't try to add that
[21:11] it won't work but when you can really
[21:14] with a sweetness of your heart forgive
[21:17] every man hold your peace and let it be
[21:21] gone it'll voize and you can add to that
[21:24] to your
[21:26] faith even one time he says when that
