TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and then little book of Zephaniah just want to take one scripture from there then I'll have you be seated Zephaniah chapter 3 verse 9 we're going to teach this morning on God's language God's language for then I will turn this is Zephaniah 3:9 for then I will will I turn to the people a pure language or this is the word return I will return the people a pure language that they may all call upon the name of the Lord to serve him with one consent you can be seated this morning it's incredible um brother brandham out of the uh Church age book and we're just going to sort of be uh all over the place this morning all over the map I should say I don't really have uh notes I've not taught Sunday School in a long time so y'all are going to have to forgive me for uh being Rusty I'm not don't consider myself a teacher but none of the other brothers who are apt to teach are good at uh good teachers were available so I'm the spare tire this morning but um we just want to um just cover this just here for a moment the God's language brother Brandon says that the Book of Revelation and we're speaking about God's language he says that the Book of Revelation is the revelation of the seven Church ages so we know that in the scripture the Bible would refer to this uh it would refer to it as the fullness of the Gentiles and so remember that word Gentile means other nations or nations so the way that God views not the way that man but the way that God views Humanity as he views Humanity as one lump as brother brandham said out of one lump uh as a Potter would take one lump of clay he makes vessels of Honor vessels of Dishonor and he makes Jews and Gentiles Nations people that are non-jews and he shows how that the fullness of the Gentiles the seven Church a would be called the seven Church ages and so we know that the way that God views time is very different than uh well let me say it this way the way God views time is the only way that matters it's the only way that matters how we understand time or history really doesn't matter how philosophers teach history doesn't really matter it's how God views history or his story and so we know that God's way of viewing time time is through this time this this this uh Gentile time is called ages or dispensations Seven Ages and brother brandham says for out of the Revelation now remember this this say how he says this the Revelation uh The Book of Revelation is the revelation of the seven Church Ages which is the fullness of the Gentiles for out of the revelations out of Revelations uh the revelation of the seven ages comes every other Revelation and so this is the way God always communicates he doesn't communicate through intellect or knowledge or education but God actually speaks very specifically through Revelation now you you you have to you you can find this all throughout the Bible you could find it from in the Old Testament uh all the way through prophets the way that that prophets would speak it's even incredible to me even the Book of Daniel and what's what's amazing I'm going to say some things today that maybe would surprise you uh but uh it surprised me too when I when I learned them but I think it's important to understand these types of things that Christendom as a whole or the opes of Christendom and when we're talking about that that encompasses everything that encompasses uh Evangelical non-denominational denominations all the way through Christendom uh um up until present time that the way that they approach God or the way that they approach the Bible the way that they approach salvation the way that they approach uh church is is categorically very different than how a True Believer does and you'll find this all the way in the beginning through Cain and Abel who had two ways to approach God two totally different ways and so I I want you to I want to make it as simple as we can this morning to to say it this way there is only two approaches to God there was always only two approaches to God and you'll find that number running in parallel to the prophet of God would say there's the mark of the beast or the seill of the Holy Ghost am there's only two there's nothing in the middle there's no multiple choice there's one or the other in this age the mark of the beast or the Seal of God and brother Bram says it this way you'll take one or the other think about how important that is here for a moment every human Jew Gentile Muslim atheist doesn't matter will take one or two approaches to God the mark of the beast or the seill of God which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we see this all the way correlated in Genesis at the very beginning that there were twins there were two boys and one was of the seed of one was of the seed of God one was of the seed of The Serpent and we know that this would carry on past Cain and Abel how did it all begin past Cana and Abel then you had a Seth you had a nimrod you had God's seed following all the way throughout history and then uh Satan's seed and so there was always two approaches Cain's approach was not satanic as we would call what we would call satanic or ritualism or or Ouija boards or Voodoo or witchcraft that wasn't the way of Cain Cain wasn't a devil the Bible uh brother bam said that Cain had in his heart he wanted to serve God he wanted to worship God and Cain here's Cain and Abel here's two two but notice this is something that God was setting in Foundation remember that everything that you see presently is only a fruit of the original seed and so the the Genesis remember is the seed chapter it's the book of Beginnings it's every you want to know how to understand everything in the world today everything in your life go back to the seed chapter you'll understand that everything that you're seeing today and I mean everything that covers everything is only a fruit or the fruition of that seed chapter of Genesis and so we notice that there was always two approaches to God a way of Cain that Jude refers to and then the way of the sons of God the seed of Seth uh and and and it was the seed line of God and so that one way we're not teaching on that here this morning and we'd get bogged down on it but we know quite simply that one was a way of blood and one was bloodless I could I could condense it down to that one was a bloodless way approach to God one was a way that came through blood or the shedding of blood and so we know that this would all I want you just to some of these we have 30 minutes so it's a you know it's a it's a uh just you have to just sort of hit highlights here and let let it let Revelation drop in but remember that that it's always two the way of Cain a bloodless way the way of Abel uh the way of the blood or the way we could say of intellect and reasoning rationalism common sense you have all of these things the the the human mind the you know through education through science civilization all of those things and then you have the way of Abel which was a way that was revealed unto him let me say this Abel didn't have a book he didn't have a teacher he didn't se he didn't he couldn't study a scroll but God was going to communicate through what what Zephaniah refers to through pure language what is that language you asked brother Matt well you'll find that all the way throughout the bible let me just give you a couple because I I I just want to I think if I give these two examples rather than trying to lay a huge Foundation it'll just bring you right up to where I'm at think of something in your Bible you have the Book of Daniel now now Daniel it's so incredible and I don't want to we're not going to take a lot of time with this but I'm just going to give you two I think two would be good two good examples to to illustrate uh the language of God and I know I've taught on this before and so just give me a moment just just uh to to be able to uh to to say this without taking up uh the entire Sunday school so um what's incredible uh give me just a moment to find my place here uh what's incredible is that you can divide The Book of Daniel into two halves this is just one example I'm going to use you could actually divide the Book of Daniel uh into two halves and you could you you'll understand that actually the Book of Daniel is written in two languages did you know that originally now you have it in your King James Bible and it's all in English you said brother Matt what are you talking about here well the original Book of Daniel was actually written in two languages because Daniel could be divided into two halves we could say and so Daniel the introduction of Prophecy when he begins to talk about prophecy um he's actually referring to Daniel chap 11 So Daniel 11 and on take you could take notes if you want on this um the the the first The Book of Daniel covers 75 years of d Daniel's life from chapter 1 through chapter 10 you're going to catch 75 years of his life but then after Daniel 10 Daniel 11 and on covers thousands of years because Daniel is actually going to turn from speaking of Daniel I want you to catch this he's it's going to speak of Daniel and then it's going to speak of Prophecy that would outlive Daniel or go beyond Daniel and so it covers thousands of of of history and so Daniel sees way off into the distant uh future actually with such accuracy now listen with such accuracy that 2third of Christian not atheist Christian Scholars today say that that part of Daniel was inserted after and is not inspired now that may shock you but it's true large large uh portion of biblical Christian men view the The Book of Daniel that Daniel there's no way the Book of Daniel could have recorded some of the historical things that would take place years after Daniel leaves the sea we're not teaching on that today but if you go and read some of the things that Daniel prophesies concerning Antioch as Epiphany specifically who is the Antichrist of BC or before the Common Era before Christ comes on the scene and you have Judah mccabes in the book of the hasmonean Empire that rose up to come against the salusin empire and hel helenistic culture that had invaded the Jews not preaching on that don't get lost in that I just want to tell you that if do a little research in history you'll find that Daniel laser accurately prophesies of this and he doesn't just stop there the the the the the the empires that would raise up that Daniel has of the Giant stature of Daniel's vision would go through every Empire that would come in the world and what does men do with that they they have a choice you either have to believe that God has a language that he speaks that is beyond human knowledge or intellect or you have to conclude that Daniel's not inspired and sadly many people do and it wasn't always that way in fact that was a generational shift that happened in what we call the enlightenment you read literature surrounding the Bible and you'll watch that the attitudes of Scholars changed and there's two key things that they change on not the text not the scroll not the dialect not the language but what choked them was two things Miracles and prophecy those are the two things that are unexplainable because they don't they don't it's not speaking our human language you follow me and so Miracles and prophecies are used or considered to be proofs of the inspiration of the Bible and so uh uh uh used to be considered Miracles and Prophets that are used to be considered proofs of the Bible and so you'll see these that people uh you know look at the miraculous and they look at the prophecy and the Prophecies of the Bible and they consider them you know uh that it would be impossible and so people say well if you just cut out the Miracles and cut out the prophecies I could believe the Bible and so instead of helping people to believe it's God's book it actually hinders people you say who what people brother Matt the intellectual mind or the way of Cain's approach to knowledge to understanding to God's word and so they treat them Miracles as fiction rather than fact as myths actually in Legends I know I taught on this here uh before but it was incredible when we we we spoke about the modern uh archaeological fine of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah you remember that and you could watch that video some people requested it from me I'll just note this just for a moment that these were two Scholars these were two Christian Seminary trained men that had stumbled upon these cities of sod this archaeological dig where they had found the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and these archaeologists had said we believe we found the ancient Dead Sea cities and here they come they ask them were there arrowheads no there were not then what destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah these Christian men pressed these archaeologists and they didn't want to answer the question and when they finally pressed them enough the archaeologist said well we call it a heat event and they said well what's a heat event what do you mean by a heat event how what's a heat event well you know it was it was it was natural disaster okay well what do you mean heat of it and he said well when we looked at the pottery that we found in the Dig we we thought that it was tainted because on the back of the pottery there was glazing the pottery was glazed raise your hand if you've heard this okay good that's about half so let me just quickly Breeze over this they found that the pottery was glazed and so they they thought the Dig is Tainted this is not the ancient city of Sodom and Gomorrah because it couldn't be because te Pottery glazing didn't happen until the Byzantine period Well after this the you know the ancient period of Sodom and Gomorrah but these men these archaeologists sent the pottery off to a lab and said Analyze This glazing what is this and the pur the the the scientists came back and said that's not glazing that's and I could say this wrong because it's been a while I'm going to give you a word that you won't understand and I don't understand because they argued that man didn't even understand it I believe it was called trinitite and they said what you're seeing is not glazing it's trinitite and he said what in the world is trinitite and she said oh that's easy trinitite is what happens to Pottery when it reaches nuclear bomb temperature and she pointed to the the bomb in New Mexico that they blew up and she said this is what they found is that Pottery looks laaz he said what are you saying she said sir what I'm saying is whatever piece of pottery you found has been in heat equivalent to a nuclear bomb and so you say brother Matt what does that mean well they conclude Sodom and Gomorrah was nuked and it was but not man's nuclear bomb God's nuclear bomb and so but I don't I say all that to say it was incredible because you say well that validates the Bible Well I didn't need that to validate the Bible now if I only spoke the language of human intellect and reasoning then yeah I would need that to validate my understanding but I understood because God spoke to me and revealed it to me in a way that wasn't revealed through scientific archaeological evidence and these two Christian men were laughing saying isn't it so awesome and the one man says to the other these are Christian Scholars the one man says to the other it's so encouraging because I my whole life have just looked at the story of Sodom and Gomorrah as one of those mythical parts of the Bible now you see how rub that rubs I don't know about you friend that rubbed me the wrong way the mythical part I'll just say it this way if I believed that there were mythical parts to God's Bible I wouldn't believe it no and so so they they said it's mythical part so this is the way that they approach these kind of stories it was you know it's validated so they believe the woman at the well was added and and Mark 16 was added they study textual criticism and textual variance through manuscripts and they try to DCT deduct it down they they've missed it that God doesn't reveal himself that way and if you try to find God that way you might find it to your own satisfaction but you won't be able to satisfy the carnal mind Beyond any certainty of what we call certain because you're speaking of things that aren't from this Dimension and so they're not validated yeah are brother Matt do you believe that the Bible's validated and proved I do Beyond A Reasonable Doubt let me just go further and say that I don't believe the message that way either but some we talk about the way of knowledge the way of Cain some have just understood the message through this deduction and reason intellectual understanding but when you hear God's language it reveals it to you in a way that studying and comparing scripture to scripture and and quote to quote can never give you and so they cut out these two things even the even the the the the woman at the well you know they say was at and this is how that they they they the modern mind treats God this is how they treat even the Book of Daniel but what you'll find even about the The Book of Daniel that's so amazing is that um the first half chapter 7 let me let me give you this so you'll find that that chapter let me just cover it fast chapter 1-6 of the Book of Daniel um you'll find This Book of Daniel you remember me doing this before and I'll do it again you could take the Book of Daniel not the Bible because remember the Bible the the to the to the Jews these were Scrolls one scroll you could take it and divid it hold it in half and you'd have two halves of this book the first half is Miracles and the second half is prophecy all of the first half is M miraculous all the second half is Daniel prophesying of Kingdoms that would come Kingdom that would raise kingdoms that would end and so those who have difficulty with the supernatural don't know what to do with the Book of Daniel it's the same way that Christian men treat the Book of Revelation it's not important was it part of the cannon maybe most of them don't believe that it was so what do they focus on Matthew Mark Luke and John say brother Matt do you believe in that absolutely but you understand that that's history hello so mankind always doesn't have a problem the human mind doesn't have a problem if you can keep God contained in a box of History they're okay with that they'll create religions and churches and pull pits and people and they'll be good moral people because you put a God in history who doesn't speak anymore he doesn't talk anymore he already spoke and we just now analyze what he said but when you say God did speak yes we look at what he said but I also believe God is still speaking then it becomes dangerous because now God is still speaking he still has a pro he still has a voice he's still using gifts hold on see it's easy to contain God Hebrews uh 9 I believe it is says it this way uh uh it says that uh refuse not him who speaketh for if they they escape not who refused him who spake from Heaven how can we escape from him who spoke from the earth another words don't people don't have a problem refusing they don't refuse the God who spoke they refuse the God who speaks and so so Daniel the chapter uh Daniel 1 through let me go fast through this so the first six chapters are easy to understand and we know them all well from Sunday school Daniel and the lions den Shadrach Meshach and abedo we know you know Meo TI you far and all the handwriting on the wall you know all of those stories that you hear from Sunday school but then if you turn your Bible over to chapter 7 through chapter 12 it's much harder to understand most can't quote anything from Daniel 7 to 12 most be because you think what is in there well because the human intellectual mind loves to hear the story story story Daniel linon but then that human mind goes prophecy what is that oh but to a Believer it's their language and so the second 7 to 12 chapters interesting fact as we said chapter here's what's here's what's interesting I remember I spoke I told you I'm just going to use two examples here they are here's one and I'm going to give you the second one chapters 1 through six of Daniel is written in the third person go read your Bible you'll find that Daniel he and D Daniel said it's always the third person chapter 7- 12 there's a shift and it says I Daniel so now it's not the third person it's the first person remember we're talking about God's language let me say it to you this way chapter 1-6 was written for the whole world chapter 7-2 was only written for those who had an ear to hear am and so 7- 12 are I Daniel the so we could say the first half of the books of Daniel is all about him the second half is by him the first half is what happened in Daniel or during Daniel's life the second half is what happens after Daniel's life and some of it we could say happened some of it is happening and some of it will happen long after we're gone so the first half is present we could say the second half of Daniel is future why did God write the Bible this way because God has a language am and so the most unusual difference between those two halves is that the first half chapter 1 through6 and the second half chapters 7-2 has something so incredible about it the first this is you're going to you're going to get a tongue twister here so listen close the first chapter of the first half is written in Hebrew the language of Hebrew which was the language of the Jews but the next five chapters are written in Aramaic which was commonly understood by everybody the masses it's the official language of that time it was used everywhere in the ancient world Aramaic so why God would you write because one was meant to be read and understand by one group of people all Humanity but then another was to be understood only by one people amen and so the first chapter is another key the first chapter of the second half is the reverse it's written in Aramaic and the next five chapters are written in Hebrew you say brother Matt what are you saying it tells you where the chapters were meant to be read or who they were directed towards so you could tell which parts were meant to be read widely and then which parts I hope you're catching it friends there's parts of your Bible that is meant and written for the whole world to understand then there's portions that are only written to you I got one thing to say thank God I've got an ear to hear and eyes to understand because I'm a better person no I'm smarter that's surely not true but because of one what is the reason brother Joe Grace Grace God's grace and so so that's the first first let me let me give you another example of this have you ever called Matthew chapter 14 look there quickly if you could we're going to close here Matthew chapter 14 Matthew chapter 14 let me hear those Bibles Bibles Bibles Bibles bring your Bible to Sunday school preach brother Matt you didn't bring yours no I didn't so if you got a phone and you got that that's fine too Matthew Chapter 14 verse 13 you got that for me Gideon Matthew chapter 14 put that up verse 13-2 1 this is something incredible and it's about the multiplication of the fishes and Loaves Matthew 14 when Jesus heard of it parted
