[41:21] opposing the Judgment of Heaven part
[41:24] four and I'm taking a subtitle tonight
[41:26] living under the new law of Liberty we
[41:29] were talking quite a bit about uh the
[41:32] new law of Liberty all right so here is
[41:35] our reading whoops let me turn it
[41:38] on Amen all right Acts chapter 2 verses
[41:42] 1 to
[41:44] three and when the day of Pentecost was
[41:47] fully
[41:48] come they were all with one Accord in
[41:52] one place and suddenly there came a
[41:55] sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty
[41:58] Wind and it filled all the house where
[42:01] they were sitting and there appeared
[42:04] unto them clothing tongues like as of
[42:07] fire and it sat upon each of them amen
[42:13] let's pray father we commit ourselves
[42:15] into your hands now Lord you see the
[42:18] thought that's on my heart father and
[42:20] I'll have to just be very careful to go
[42:23] along at a certain clip to get through
[42:25] it so I just as ask for your mercy Lord
[42:28] that you'll anoint me to what needs to
[42:30] be said tonight father to this audience
[42:33] present to the audience streaming and
[42:35] even those who would hear it at a later
[42:37] time father we commit ourselves into
[42:40] your hands very grateful Lord to have
[42:42] you helping Lord you're you're more than
[42:45] a help Lord we're here to help you it's
[42:48] it's all about you father and so I pray
[42:51] now that you will reveal yourself to the
[42:54] people Lord and let it burn on their
[42:56] hearts as that has burned in mind commit
[42:59] it to you in Jesus name amen praise the
[43:01] Lord you can be
[43:12] seated we have been
[43:18] endeavoring we've been endeavoring to
[43:22] establish a point for the last number of
[43:25] sermons over over the last number of
[43:28] weeks and I think that it would be fair
[43:31] to say and I'm sure you would agree that
[43:33] the word that we have been trying to
[43:36] establish so distinctly so clearly is
[43:41] that Christ and his word are the same
[43:45] thing and I have said to you and I have
[43:47] expressed to you and stressed to you
[43:50] that I believe and it is my belief that
[43:52] the Lord is continually bringing this
[43:56] and I promise you it's not just at this
[43:58] pull pit I ran into it in the men's
[44:01] meeting we ran into it at a Minister's
[44:02] meeting everywhere I go preachers that I
[44:05] talked to we realize that that that
[44:08] there is such a a relaxing of this idea
[44:13] in the world today and we really dealt
[44:15] with it very closely on Sunday that was
[44:18] a great blessing to me
[44:22] that see not just understand what's
[44:26] happening in the Christian world and the
[44:28] abandonment of the Living Word by the
[44:31] Christian world to to now you say that
[44:34] that's a rude thing to say well I'm not
[44:37] the one who said they would put Christ
[44:40] out
[44:41] right brother Brandon was not the one
[44:43] who said they would do that a prophet
[44:45] only identified that that scripture had
[44:47] come to pass and that he was found on
[44:50] the outside of his church knocking and
[44:53] we're going to look further in that
[44:55] tonight and and we found out that that
[44:58] there was no possibility to separate God
[45:02] from his word and that's the point we've
[45:06] been stressing so as you might imagine
[45:08] I'm going to hit two quotes here uh that
[45:11] make just exactly that statement as we
[45:13] move on in our material tonight brother
[45:16] brandham in the spoken word is Original
[45:18] Seed he says I believe the Bible is the
[45:22] word you should never wonder what
[45:24] William Brandon believed about the Bible
[45:27] I believe the Bible is the word the
[45:30] whole truth and Jesus is the word made
[45:34] manifest he and his word is one and the
[45:39] same there should be no doubt there
[45:41] should be no confusion there should
[45:43] certainly not be any room in the
[45:46] believer's mind at least those who plan
[45:49] to go in a
[45:52] Rapture
[45:54] the thank you those who plan to go in a
[45:58] Rapture there should be no doubt in your
[46:00] mind there should be no room in your
[46:04] mind to entertain that you could have a
[46:07] life that didn't match the word and
[46:10] still call yourself a Believer believing
[46:13] you're going to go in the
[46:14] Rapture this is this is really becoming
[46:19] the dis the
[46:20] identifying feature of those who are
[46:23] born again of the spirit of God and that
[46:26] is that the token will and must be on
[46:30] display and so he goes on now this is I
[46:33] want you to notice this this is uh March
[46:37] the 18th 1962 all right he comes now
[46:42] about uh 10 months later in
[46:45] 1963 in the message an absolute and that
[46:50] title uh blew up in my mind just before
[46:54] I walked out here so what I'm about to
[46:57] say it's just before I walked out here
[46:59] am all right so because I hadn't noticed
[47:03] it as much as I've been uh staring at it
[47:05] and creating this I was I come up off my
[47:08] knees in the office and sat down began
[47:10] to look over my notes again for the 10th
[47:12] or so time and suddenly the Lord began
[47:15] to I began to notice something that left
[47:18] me astonished in the absolute Here and
[47:21] Now notice that it is January the 27th
[47:25] 1963
[47:27] all right this is just prior to the
[47:29] seals he says in St John the 5th chapter
[47:32] the 24th verse he that heareth my word
[47:35] my words and believeth on him that sent
[47:38] me has everlasting life and shall not
[47:41] come into the Judgment but has passed
[47:44] from Death unto life notice what he says
[47:47] that's
[47:49] absolute thank God that's absolute if
[47:53] you've passed from Death to life you
[47:55] shall never come into to the Judgment
[47:57] that's absolute see that's it he
[48:01] says now not him that maketh
[48:06] believe but he that believeth now we've
[48:10] got to have an absolute I love that
[48:13] we've got to have an absolute all right
[48:17] you believe that now uh he says he he
[48:20] says um we've got to have an absolute
[48:23] and he is the absolute and he and his
[48:28] word are the same we can't separate them
[48:34] he and his word are the same all right
[48:38] so now he when I looked at this and I
[48:41] thought my goodness this is January the
[48:45] 27th I and he's coming to the seals and
[48:49] this is his absolute on his way there
[48:53] and actually that what you will find is
[48:55] that exactly s Sundays later exactly 49
[49:01] days later from this statement on a
[49:04] Sunday morning back in his home church
[49:07] he will begin a series that will turn a
[49:11] corner in Earth's Christian history on
[49:15] that Sunday morning he will bring God in
[49:20] Simplicity and in the evening he will
[49:23] bring the breach between the ages and
[49:26] the seals it will be the last time that
[49:30] he comes to a pull pit as merely the
[49:34] seventh angel to the Church of
[49:39] leoda when he comes back to the pull pit
[49:42] on Monday to begin the first seal the
[49:46] ministry of Elijah will be in full steam
[49:50] and it will no longer be just the angel
[49:53] to the church age Hallelujah it'll be
[49:57] the last time on this 7th Sunday this
[50:00] 49th day and he's preaching as far as
[50:04] that angel messenger can go the breach
[50:08] between the ages and the seals and the
[50:12] ages is the church and the woman and the
[50:15] seals are Christ and the man and a
[50:18] prophet has gone after from this
[50:20] statement he's gone 49 days seven
[50:24] Sundays and on the 50th he hallelujah oh
[50:28] my friends there's nothing more to be
[50:31] said to the Church of leoda the
[50:33] messenger can't go any further on
[50:36] exactly the 50th day later he will he
[50:40] will he will be a participant in the
[50:44] unveiling of the first
[50:46] seal
[50:48] Hallelujah exactly the 50th day later
[50:52] after seven Church ages and nearly 2,000
[50:56] years years the church system of
[50:59] man-made Creed is a dead
[51:03] system and it's time to call out a bride
[51:08] Pentecost could not receive those seals
[51:10] they had already made their choice and I
[51:13] have made
[51:15] mine
[51:17] Hallelujah Let It Be notable to you as
[51:20] it was to me that 50 days prior to that
[51:24] event God's prophet is absolutely sure
[51:28] he's an absolute he's absolutely sure
[51:32] that Christ and his word are the same
[51:36] thing God has an Elijah Prophet who's
[51:39] ready to come to the seals who is
[51:42] absolutely after 30 years of ministry he
[51:45] is
[51:46] certain that Christ and his word are the
[51:51] same
[51:55] thing to this
[51:58] degree we we
[52:00] realize this evening friends that
[52:04] brother brandham now will go and I'm
[52:06] going to show you the next quote there
[52:09] uh because the next time he's making
[52:11] this statement it's going to be after
[52:13] the seals and you're going to see in
[52:16] these next number of quotes after he was
[52:19] prior to the seals absolutely sure that
[52:23] he and his word are the same
[52:25] thing and now he's more sure than ever
[52:28] that he and his word are the same thing
[52:32] and it is based on
[52:35] that it is based on that indisputable
[52:41] fact that his that his
[52:44] fullness that if it is if it is not
[52:48] being displayed on your
[52:51] outside then it may be time for you to
[52:55] question his presence on your
[53:00] inside because it's not about a Creed
[53:03] anymore he's done with that system it's
[53:06] not about works or ideology of mankind
[53:10] this is about who has received the body
[53:13] word of the son of man and who has now
[53:16] become a partaker in the body word and
[53:19] you're feeding on the body word of a son
[53:22] of
[53:24] man he says in calling Jesus on the
[53:29] scene my on my birthday no
[53:34] less he and his word are the
[53:38] same let his word identify him that's
[53:43] the way he said you could prove he was
[53:47] God is't that amazing that's the way he
[53:49] said you could prove he was God because
[53:53] that the works that God gave him to do
[53:56] was done done by him if I do not the
[53:58] works of my father then don't believe me
[54:01] see that's how it identified him that's
[54:06] how that's how to identify you if you
[54:11] say you're a Christian and the
[54:13] identification of a Christian the Bible
[54:16] Christian is not worked in you then
[54:19] there is something wrong see these signs
[54:23] shall follow them that believe
[54:27] yes sir not maybe they will they
[54:32] will and I'm not talking about calling
[54:35] fire down out of heaven or speaking
[54:37] swirls into existence I'm not I'm not
[54:40] talking about any physical sensation you
[54:42] could have I'm talking about is your
[54:45] faith anchored in the word that God has
[54:48] brought to us in this hour are you just
[54:51] as absolutely sure that Christ and his
[54:54] word are the same are you as sure as a
[54:57] prophet was
[55:00] sure if you are then he'll come to you
[55:03] like he came to
[55:06] him
[55:08] see brother Brenham comes to the Rich
[55:12] Young
[55:13] Ruler this is the portrait we have
[55:16] Jesus reasoning with the Rich Young
[55:19] Ruler and brother branam takes that
[55:22] young man in a number of sermons one of
[55:24] my favorites is his last message of
[55:27] leadership his last text sermon in the
[55:29] world before he goes home he'll preach
[55:31] communion there in Arizona but uh
[55:34] leadership there in cavina California is
[55:37] the last text sermon that he'll take and
[55:40] it's always been very special to me
[55:43] because you know that's the sermon where
[55:45] brother brandham comes down and and he
[55:48] he he's he the whole thing is you know
[55:50] at one time you know your mother LED you
[55:52] and then your father LED you and then a
[55:54] teacher LED you and then a Sunday School
[55:56] LED you and then a pastor LED you and he
[55:58] said now who's leading you now see and
[56:03] so I and and that as a young man that
[56:06] always gripped me who's leading you now
[56:09] and I always could say Lord I want it to
[56:12] be you leading me and I know I don't
[56:15] always follow your leadership but I
[56:17] always come back to it again and say
[56:19] Lead Me
[56:20] Lord
[56:22] hallelujah to me it was so tender how
[56:25] that brother brandham he comes down and
[56:27] you can listen to it yourself you can go
[56:29] and hear the tape one of the clearer
[56:31] tapes and brother Bram starts singing at
[56:33] the very end of it till we meet till we
[56:36] meet till we meet at Jesus feet and he
[56:40] comes down and the last the last bars
[56:44] the last time you hear his voice this is
[56:46] the last text sermon he'll preach as a
[56:49] full text sermon and he says now now God
[56:55] be with with you till we meet
[57:00] again and that always grips my heart and
[57:02] I just say I'm going to meet him
[57:05] Hallelujah because I know the same God
[57:07] he knew I've feasted on the same word
[57:10] he's feasted on I have the same perfect
[57:12] faith and a perfect God who kept a
[57:14] perfect promise Hallelujah and it's
[57:17] going to bring me to a perfect condition
[57:19] and it is in spite of me it is and he's
[57:22] doing it to you in spite of you he's
[57:24] doing it to you
[57:28] now he comes here to the Rich Young
[57:30] Ruler and I want you to pay Keen
[57:31] attention to these words
[57:34] here he says the
[57:37] world the world
[57:40] began it ends the the the world began it
[57:46] ends Jesus heavens and earth will pass
[57:50] away but my words shall never because he
[57:54] is the word he is the word and that is
[57:58] eternal so you can't change it it
[58:01] doesn't matter that people have tried to
[58:03] change it it doesn't matter that they've
[58:05] imagined it changed it hasn't changed
[58:07] it's Eternal and all those who are
[58:10] Eternal are Eternal with it
[58:15] Hallelujah and that word in
[58:19] you produces the Life of Christ if I
[58:23] could take the life out of a peach tree
[58:25] and put it in a pair wouldn't it
[58:26] wouldn't bear peaches anymore it would
[58:28] have pears on it because that's the life
[58:30] in the tree would produce what it is the
[58:33] life that's in you shows what you are
[58:36] your life testifies so loud in you until
[58:38] your testimony is not heard your life is
[58:40] louder than your than your lips you see
[58:43] so so this this explains so much why the
[58:47] world makes such a claim with their lips
[58:50] about loving Jesus but their life
[58:52] doesn't match that they love Jesus they
[58:54] love a concept of Jesus they love an
[58:57] idea of Jesus they they admire the fine
[59:00] qualities of Jesus but they Reserve to
[59:04] themselves the right to deny his power
[59:06] why would they deny that because they
[59:08] don't want to have their life changed
[59:10] and and the power of God changes
[59:13] lives
[59:15] amen they know what you
[59:18] are by the life you live and the things
[59:22] that you do if the Life of Christ I love
[59:25] this now
[59:27] if the Life of
[59:29] Christ if the Life of Christ is in you
[59:31] then therefore the works and Life of
[59:33] Christ you live because that's his life
[59:36] living through you you're just in a
[59:38] vessel to carry on the work of God what
[59:41] a rash thing he says what a rash thing
[59:45] this young man did when he wasn't
[59:48] interested in such an investment he had
[59:51] great wealth we're told but the wealth
[59:54] of the world has to to perish listen to
[59:57] me young people you're just starting out
[59:59] in your careers here here a
[1:00:02] prophet here here Jesus trying to reason
[1:00:05] with this rich young
[1:00:06] man and he brother brandham said in
[1:00:09] leadership he he turned down the
[1:00:11] leadership of eternal life and he's
[1:00:14] standing on his roof one day looking out
[1:00:16] over his kingdom and he's thinking and
[1:00:18] know I've got so many so much stuff I
[1:00:21] got to tear all my barns down and build
[1:00:23] bigger ones and I'm going to take your
[1:00:25] ease Soul take your ease you're loaded
[1:00:27] it's all it's all Easy Street from here
[1:00:30] on and he didn't know there's an angel
[1:00:32] standing behind him you fool you don't
[1:00:36] even realize today this day you're going
[1:00:38] to give an account for your
[1:00:42] soul and so he
[1:00:45] says he says he had great wealth we're
[1:00:48] told but the wealth of the world has to
[1:00:52] perish what about the young man's
[1:00:54] condition today wonder where he's at
[1:00:56] that he turned down the opportunity he
[1:00:59] had yet he was a Christian believer or a
[1:01:01] Believer we would say to be more
[1:01:05] fundamentally he was a Believer he was
[1:01:08] walking in all the light that the law
[1:01:10] had and probably a loyal member of some
[1:01:13] great congregation but yet knew that he
[1:01:16] lacked eternal life now brother Brandon
[1:01:19] points that out he knew that he could
[1:01:21] tell that young man although he had kept
[1:01:23] all the Commandments he still asked
[1:01:25] asking Jesus what do I do to get eternal
[1:01:28] life so in spite of all of his good
[1:01:31] works and his fine congregation that he
[1:01:34] went to he knew he was still missing
[1:01:37] eternal life all right now he had seen
[1:01:42] something in Jesus that he never saw in
[1:01:46] other men he saw his priest seen his
[1:01:50] people he had seen good men but there
[1:01:55] was something
[1:01:56] special about Jesus
[1:01:59] Christ oh I love that you see friends
[1:02:03] because that the Original Seed will
[1:02:07] always grow the original life like it
[1:02:10] did in Genesis then therefore we can
[1:02:13] establish that the token will be on
[1:02:16] display you see you understand it's not
[1:02:18] about you trying to put a token on
[1:02:21] display if if the seed that was in
[1:02:24] Genesis grew if that same seed is in you
[1:02:26] it'll grow it's the spoken word it's the
[1:02:29] Original Seed and if you have believed
[1:02:32] if you've heard it and you've believed
[1:02:33] it and you've accepted it I promise you
[1:02:36] it's not about gritting your teeth and
[1:02:38] trying to produce something it's about
[1:02:40] relaxing in the Holy Spirit and just
[1:02:43] saying Lord take over my
[1:02:45] life Hallelujah that's why you're here
[1:02:48] that we read those quotes here recently
[1:02:51] about brother Bram going all the way
[1:02:53] back there in Job 38 and before when
[1:02:56] morning Stars sang together and sons of
[1:02:58] God shouted for joy and brother Brenham
[1:03:00] said you don't remember it but you were
[1:03:02] there you saw Redemption that's why you
[1:03:04] were shouting you just believe the lie
[1:03:06] then you just believe it now Hallelujah
[1:03:09] I want to tell you something friends
[1:03:10] that gives you a whole new perspective
[1:03:12] of life and I just say I know why I'm
[1:03:15] here and I know what I'm supposed to do
[1:03:18] Hallelujah and it's not trying to be a
[1:03:20] rich young ruler it's trying to give my
[1:03:23] life to his majesty and I'm going to
[1:03:25] have eternal life waiting for me
[1:03:28] Hallelujah this life's not about this
[1:03:32] life you chase after the things of this
[1:03:34] world you'll regret it
[1:03:37] bitterly the token will display itself
[1:03:40] because the Original Seed because the
[1:03:44] Original Seed will grow the original
[1:03:46] life just like it did in
[1:03:48] Genesis the seed we realize has power in
[1:03:53] it as a potential
[1:03:56] am and that's important it has power in
[1:04:00] the
[1:04:01] seed as a
[1:04:05] potential brother brandham says here in
[1:04:08] later on in
[1:04:11] 1965 God's power to
[1:04:15] transform when that seventh
[1:04:18] morning when God looked upon it all and
[1:04:21] he said it's good I love this I I'm
[1:04:26] pleased with it yeah I'm glad I did it
[1:04:30] and I thought about that I thought about
[1:04:32] the all knowing god knew from the
[1:04:35] beginning Every Act of sin I would
[1:04:38] commit before I was redeemed and he knew
[1:04:41] every stumble I would ever ever make
[1:04:44] after I've been redeemed including the
[1:04:46] ones I haven't stumbled at yet and he's
[1:04:48] all he's still saying I'm glad I did it
[1:04:52] I'm glad I put Jason on the earth here
[1:04:54] I'm glad I got bethl tacle I'm glad I
[1:04:56] got these people yes they've had
[1:04:58] problems yes they've stumbled yes they
[1:05:00] and they will again but I don't regret
[1:05:03] it I'm here to tell you God doesn't
[1:05:05] regret you he's glad he did
[1:05:08] it
[1:05:10] Hallelujah Jehovah Eagle is glad he
[1:05:13] found you he'll never not be glad he
[1:05:16] found
[1:05:18] you and it's all now under
[1:05:21] control and I have put my trust in my
[1:05:24] son and his wife life that they will
[1:05:28] make them head of IT see he says he he
[1:05:30] made them the head of
[1:05:32] it that that they will watch over it all
[1:05:36] and see that it's all right that
[1:05:40] everything will bring forth of its
[1:05:44] kind now he has the power to do
[1:05:49] that God then said well if it's all so
[1:05:54] good and it can't can't be anything else
[1:05:57] because it's my own desire it's the way
[1:06:00] I want it and I have spoke it that way
[1:06:04] and my words has brought it just exactly
[1:06:07] the way I wanted it and there it is it's
[1:06:10] all good and I'm here to tell you
[1:06:13] something friends he's never changed his
[1:06:15] mind about his Original
[1:06:18] Seed it's all
[1:06:23] good that's why he took Enoch off the
[1:06:27] Earth Enoch a type of the Bride took him
[1:06:29] off before the Judgment he took Noah and
[1:06:33] the righteous seed a type of the 144,000
[1:06:37] brother brandham taught us there and
[1:06:38] brother Bram covers that in 10 virgins
[1:06:40] and proving his word in different places
[1:06:43] 1964 and uh and and he says Enoch was a
[1:06:46] type of the Bride Noah of course was the
[1:06:49] type of the 144,000 who are who are in
[1:06:52] the Ark of Safety right as the judgment
[1:06:55] is ready to commence see so but Enoch
[1:06:58] escaped home before the Judgment began
[1:07:01] and so he says here so he says and God
[1:07:04] and so he says now all right so we've
[1:07:07] read that and there it is it's all good
[1:07:12] and everything under control to bring
[1:07:15] forth of its kind now remember to bring
[1:07:19] when he put the seed in the Earth the
[1:07:21] seed can only come forth with the power
[1:07:23] of life within it to trans transform it
[1:07:26] from a seed to a plant or whatever it
[1:07:27] was his transforming power now God put
[1:07:31] the seed in
[1:07:33] there with
[1:07:37] potentials that it would be what he said
[1:07:41] it would be say
[1:07:43] well okay that's pretty good news but
[1:07:47] I'm a little uncomfortable with the word
[1:07:48] that it's just the
[1:07:50] potential well don't fear there's a way
[1:07:53] to make it sure
[1:07:56] and as long as it stayed in its right
[1:07:59] category it would be just exactly what
[1:08:02] God said it would be it had to be that
[1:08:05] way because he made it that way and made
[1:08:09] a channel see don't lose that and he
[1:08:12] made a channel in his line of word it
[1:08:16] will have to bring forth exactly like
[1:08:18] his word said it would do it cannot move
[1:08:20] from there it's channeled just exactly
[1:08:23] right so with everything
[1:08:26] in the trust of his own son that it
[1:08:28] would be that way then God said it's all
[1:08:32] good so I'll just rest we were talking
[1:08:34] Sunday about our opportunity to prove
[1:08:37] that we're not like Eve we are the
[1:08:40] second Eve we're not like that Eve that
[1:08:42] fell this is the Eve that won't fall

[1:12:15] room and they were a bunch of
[1:12:18] cowards I'd never I'd have been too much
[1:12:21] of a coward to say that
[1:12:25] they were brother brandham called him in
[1:12:27] another place mechanic filled
[1:12:32] cowards here's what I want you to grasp
[1:12:35] as
[1:12:36] I turn the corner and race for the
[1:12:39] Finish Line tonight at least as far as
[1:12:41] we'll get
[1:12:43] tonight these
[1:12:45] cowards these sneaking around corners
[1:12:48] trying not to be
[1:12:49] noticed hiding away in a locked up
[1:12:53] room where our brothers and
[1:12:56] sisters they were children of God all
[1:13:00] 120 of
[1:13:02] them and at this point they're mechanic
[1:13:06] filled
[1:13:08] Believers they're mechanic filled
[1:13:12] cowards a cowardly little Bunch whoops a
[1:13:17] cowardly little Bunch sneaking around
[1:13:20] the corner locked themselves in an upper
[1:13:24] room they were a bunch buch of cowards
[1:13:26] look at that they had God on the
[1:13:32] outside they knowed all the Creeds and
[1:13:36] the formulas and
[1:13:38] everything can I change that quote I I
[1:13:41] don't mean change it not change the
[1:13:43] meaning of it can I add something for
[1:13:46] your Clarity I promise I won't change
[1:13:47] the meaning I'm going to add some
[1:13:49] clarity I want you to own it that where
[1:13:53] you need to own it tonight can I read it
[1:13:55] like
[1:13:56] this those 120 precious Saints knowed
[1:14:01] all the Creeds and the formulas and
[1:14:07] everything they knowed it all
[1:14:10] friends and yet they were mechanic
[1:14:14] filled
[1:14:16] cowards when I think about that when
[1:14:18] when when that goes through my mind and
[1:14:21] I I I think about you know is there
[1:14:24] anyone in here
[1:14:25] tonight now I want to get real personal
[1:14:27] is that
[1:14:29] okay I'm only taking you where I went
[1:14:33] studying
[1:14:35] this because we have a lot of
[1:14:39] potential and we we know we're
[1:14:43] Believers I know I am I know I am I know
[1:14:48] I fail but I know I'm a
[1:14:50] Believer I know that when I do fail it's
[1:14:54] not because because I desired that
[1:14:56] lifestyle it's just something in my
[1:14:59] flesh got the better of me wasn't prayed
[1:15:01] up enough wasn't in my Bible enough
[1:15:03] wasn't at church enough whatever
[1:15:04] whatever whatever any one of us tonight
[1:15:07] could write out a whole board full of
[1:15:10] reasons but I'm here to tell you you've
[1:15:13] got more potential than that I'm here to
[1:15:16] tell you there is a gene of God that's
[1:15:19] ready to come on display I'm here to
[1:15:21] tell you you you're just on the you're
[1:15:23] you're just at that point where where
[1:15:25] you can operate under the law of Liberty
[1:15:28] and which means as we showed you Sunday
[1:15:30] it's finally where you're finally a full
[1:15:33] free moral agent and you can actually
[1:15:35] choose to live in the image of
[1:15:38] God hallelujah because nobody's a free
[1:15:42] moral agent they are free moral agent
[1:15:44] but not fully because when they're born
[1:15:46] in sin their mind is enmity against God
[1:15:48] it's hostile against God Amen that's
[1:15:51] what we were showing you Sunday but I'm
[1:15:53] glad there's a way past that I'm glad
[1:15:55] there's a power greater than the power
[1:15:57] of sin I was born under there's a power
[1:16:00] that can deliver me out of
[1:16:02] that and release the potentials that's
[1:16:05] down inside me and all do I ever want
[1:16:08] those released I want them on display I
[1:16:10] want it to be on my life I want the
[1:16:12] devil to know it I want my family to
[1:16:14] feel it I want the world to shake under
[1:16:16] it say oh you're trying to make
[1:16:17] something yourself nothing doing I'm
[1:16:19] just trying to be all that he has a
[1:16:21] vision of me whatever is his vision I
[1:16:24] want to be be all of
[1:16:28] that but of course I find as you find
[1:16:31] tonight that we don't always maximize
[1:16:34] our potential I thought about this
[1:16:37] tonight is there anybody here tonight
[1:16:40] that could relate
[1:16:41] to to to these
[1:16:45] 120 of our precious brothers and sisters
[1:16:48] am anyone who loves the
[1:16:53] Lord like the deciples did but finds it
[1:16:57] hard to overcome their fear of standing
[1:17:01] up and standing out for the name of the
[1:17:04] Lord standing strong and standing on
[1:17:09] display like these 120 like the
[1:17:13] disciples loved the Lord loved the Lord
[1:17:16] believed him they were there because
[1:17:19] they believed him but they were
[1:17:22] afraid they they were believers they
[1:17:24] were genan seed people but yet they were
[1:17:28] afraid they had
[1:17:30] potential but they needed something more
[1:17:32] they had to have something Beyond
[1:17:34] themselves to set that thing off is
[1:17:37] there anybody in here tonight who like
[1:17:39] that like the disciples love the Lord
[1:17:42] like the disciples did but find
[1:17:45] sometimes it's hard to overcome a fear
[1:17:46] of standing up for Christ or standing
[1:17:48] out for Christ and taking on the name
[1:17:51] and taking his word and standing
[1:17:53] publicly for it not now I'm not talking
[1:17:55] about the politically correct Jesus
[1:17:57] because Jesus is anything but
[1:18:00] politically correct I'm talking about
[1:18:02] the real one that was rejected by the
[1:18:04] masses the disciples were afraid for a
[1:18:09] reason they were afraid for a
[1:18:12] reason they weren't they weren't afraid
[1:18:15] because Jesus was
[1:18:17] popular they weren't afraid because he
[1:18:19] was hip and he was accepted by the
[1:18:22] masses just the opposite of that
[1:18:26] see like
[1:18:28] Peter like James like
[1:18:31] John maybe just like Peter James and
[1:18:35] John you've had a relationship for years
[1:18:38] with the Lord you believe in him you
[1:18:42] love him with a very genuine love and
[1:18:46] you believe You' die for
[1:18:50] him Peter felt that Peter felt all of
[1:18:54] that
[1:18:55] just before he denied
[1:18:58] him just before under intense pressure
[1:19:03] he denied
[1:19:04] him you've read that sad part of Simon's
[1:19:08] history we started hearing about his
[1:19:10] denial as children in Sunday school
[1:19:13] class you know it was a mistake you knew
[1:19:17] it as a child I learned what Peter did
[1:19:20] there as a boy and I thought he
[1:19:21] shouldn't have done that
[1:19:25] we've all agreed that he shouldn't have
[1:19:28] done that and and and and yet you you
[1:19:32] you find sometimes yourself
[1:19:35] also somehow afraid to really stand up
[1:19:39] for Jesus to really be willing to step
[1:19:42] out and represent his name
[1:19:46] authentically authentically we're not
[1:19:49] talking about the social gospel friends
[1:19:51] we're talking about a a deep sincerity
[1:19:54] where you're willing to stand out from
[1:19:55] the crowd and and and and and if you're
[1:19:59] like me you you lament the times when
[1:20:02] you as brother brandham talks about lot
[1:20:04] he said lot was a righteous man and the
[1:20:07] Bible says it vexed his the sins of
[1:20:09] Sodom vexed his righteous Soul daily
[1:20:12] every
[1:20:13] day but brother brandham said like like
[1:20:16] like such a sassr kcki and would say he
[1:20:21] just didn't have the plain nerve to
[1:20:24] stand against
[1:20:27] it sometimes we're like Peter James
[1:20:31] John sometimes we love him but we lack
[1:20:34] the plain nerve to stand up for him we
[1:20:37] believe him but sometimes we find
[1:20:40] ourselves unwilling to not look like
[1:20:42] we're denying him we love him with all
[1:20:45] of our heart like those 120 did with and
[1:20:49] and we're talking about a love with an
[1:20:50] oldfashioned love of God and a love of
[1:20:53] Holiness before before God and before
[1:20:55] his people I'm going to I'm going to
[1:20:57] tell you something friends like brother
[1:20:59] brandham said they were cowards because
[1:21:02] they they had an experience with the
[1:21:04] Lord on the outside and I just thought
[1:21:06] tonight that if there's anybody in here
[1:21:08] and you say I'm too much like Peter
[1:21:10] James and John I'm too much like those
[1:21:12] 120 before the experience of the Holy
[1:21:15] Spirit came and and and I want to say to
[1:21:17] you tonight you need to get that outside
[1:21:20] relationship down on the
[1:21:22] inside that's what they need friends
[1:21:25] they couldn't stay with just an outside
[1:21:28] relationship they had had that for
[1:21:32] years and oh my how many of us and I say
[1:21:35] I'm right there with you how many times
[1:21:37] I've said Lord all I need is more of you
[1:21:40] on the inside because if I can get more
[1:21:42] of you on the inside there'll be more of
[1:21:44] you showing on the outside and that's
[1:21:46] what I'm here for that's why I was sent
[1:21:49] to the world that's my mission that's
[1:21:51] why you're here do you know why you're
[1:21:54] here you're not here to chase the Leo to
[1:21:56] S dream you're not
[1:21:59] here go all out but understand why
[1:22:03] you're here and understand what you're
[1:22:05] to do this is just a approving grounds
[1:22:08] this is just a training field we've got
[1:22:10] a whole another life laying out in front
[1:22:12] of us
[1:22:15] friends your prayer should be Lord move
[1:22:19] from an outside relationship down to my
[1:22:22] inside amen
[1:22:25] they why why would he not be on the
[1:22:27] inside why is he only on the outside
[1:22:29] brother Jason I've been a Believer like
[1:22:31] for years so is Peter but I really love
[1:22:34] him so did the
[1:22:36] 120 but I believed him I and I've walked
[1:22:39] with him so had James and
[1:22:41] John oh friends my they had all opened
[1:22:45] their heart to the Lord and I would say
[1:22:49] tonight if you love him and you wonder
[1:22:51] why maybe he's not more of him on the
[1:22:53] inside Maybe he's came as far as he can
[1:22:56] because you're hindering
[1:22:59] him now I'm now I'm crossing now I'm
[1:23:02] going to cross you know o over into the
[1:23:05] side where we are born of the of the
[1:23:07] spirit of God because even even after
[1:23:10] Peter was born of the spirit of God he
[1:23:11] still had a few Hang-Ups even after the
[1:23:15] Holy Ghost came you even find you know
[1:23:17] God forbid that this would sound
[1:23:19] critical but you even find Paul and
[1:23:21] Barnabas debating and arguing so great
[1:23:24] was their argument they had to go their
[1:23:26] separate ways they couldn't they had to
[1:23:28] break fellowship and Brotherhood I don't
[1:23:31] say they were in sin or had some amazing
[1:23:33] failure I just simply say I believe like
[1:23:36] God did in our in our in our modern day
[1:23:38] prophet he showed just enough of his
[1:23:40] hinder parts to give me courage to give
[1:23:42] you courage because I know that Moses
[1:23:44] made mistakes and David made mistakes
[1:23:46] and Abraham made mistakes I know the
[1:23:48] brother Brandon made mistakes I know the
[1:23:50] apostles made mistakes but Jesus makes
[1:23:52] no mistakes and his word puts you in a
[1:23:56] mistake-free condition and once you
[1:23:58] allow him to be on the
[1:24:02] inside open your heart today you know
[1:24:05] what I'd do if I were you I'd just say
[1:24:06] Lord come on
[1:24:08] in come on in I don't want just an
[1:24:11] outside relationship I want an inside
[1:24:16] relationship ask him to burn all the
[1:24:18] desires of the world out of you replace
[1:24:20] all of those fears and give you some
[1:24:22] courage I'm going to hear I'm going to
[1:24:24] tell you something friends do you know
[1:24:25] what the richest fuel for courage is the
[1:24:28] joy of the
[1:24:30] Lord It's your
[1:24:32] strength I mean when you have the joy of
[1:24:35] the Lord the glory is so great you want
[1:24:38] to tell everybody you're not a mechanic
[1:24:41] filled coward you're not hiding you want
[1:24:43] to tell everybody I'm not saying we
[1:24:44] abandon wisdom but I'm going to tell you
[1:24:46] something you'll become a fisherman and
[1:24:48] you'll be fishing every day and you'll
[1:24:50] be you won't you won't you won't be
[1:24:52] throwing away wisdom you'll be throwing
[1:24:53] that lure and you'll be trying to reel
[1:24:55] them in and if you don't get a bite
[1:24:57] throw it another spot and throw it
[1:24:58] another spot but you won't be a mechanic
[1:25:01] filled
[1:25:02] coward
[1:25:04] Hallelujah you'll keep tossing that lure
[1:25:06] every chance you
[1:25:08] get you'll you'll you'll scheme for ways
[1:25:13] to throw that
[1:25:15] lure you'll drop a little word here and
[1:25:17] there like brother Brandon used to do on
[1:25:20] purpose you'll do you somebody got a
[1:25:22] nice car and you'll start talking about
[1:25:23] a nice car next thing you know it's
[1:25:25] about the love of God who gave him that
[1:25:27] nice
[1:25:28] car you'll scheme and connive why
[1:25:31] because you're being as wise as a
[1:25:33] serpent but you're being as harmless as
[1:25:35] a dove while you're doing it they know
[1:25:39] all the
[1:25:41] Creeds they knowed all the Creeds and

[1:49:06] somehow I knew it was an angel I'm still

[1:49:11] slipped under I landed exactly on my
[1:49:15] knees and uh nothing happened to me
[1:49:19] which was kind of shocking to me because
[1:49:22] uh it was there in the shower and I I
[1:49:24] should have hurt something pretty
[1:49:26] bad but uh as I come to church here
[1:49:30] tonight and I'm part of this beautiful
[1:49:32] service that we had tonight I realized
[1:49:35] that uh you know God's in everything the
[1:49:37] natural type of spiritual but I was here
[1:49:40] in the altar on my knees and I said Lord
[1:49:44] you're so wonderful because uh I don't
[1:49:48] know it was a fall or what but you know
[1:49:51] he protected me and uh he protects us
[1:49:54] all but I just landed on my knees and
[1:49:56] without nothing being hurt anything
[1:49:58] happening to me and it was just a shock
[1:50:02] so I'm I'm grateful to have been here
