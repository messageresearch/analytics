[1:44] it
[1:48] you love him this morning maybe he could
[1:51] just meet the computer or the bread
[2:17] wonderful amen let's just read here
[2:20] genesis chapter 12. i'd like to
[2:23] speak this morning and i'd like to just
[2:25] teach on this as
[2:26] a little bit of time that we have i'd
[2:29] like to title this
[2:30] the scandal of particularity and we're
[2:33] going to see here
[2:34] just what we're speaking about here when
[2:36] we read our scripture let's read verse 1
[2:38] now the lord had said unto abram get me
[2:41] out of thy country and from my kindred
[2:42] and from my father's house
[2:44] unto a land that i will show thee and i
[2:47] will make of thee a great nation and i
[2:48] will bless thee and make thy name great
[2:51] and thou shalt be a blessing and i will
[2:53] bless them that bless thee
[2:55] and curse him that curseth thee and in
[2:58] thee
[2:58] shall all families of the earth be
[3:00] blessed galatians chapter three one more
[3:02] scripture and then we'll have you be
[3:04] seated in galatians 3 verse 29 just one
[3:08] scripture there one passage we preached
[3:11] on this
[3:12] a couple wednesdays ago galatians 3
[3:14] verse 29
[3:16] and if you be christ's then
[3:19] are you abraham's seed
[3:23] and heirs according to the promise
[3:26] you can have your seats this morning the
[3:27] scandal of particularity
[3:30] is a term used by uh scholars
[3:33] and it's a uh we're not at all gonna
[3:36] break down or get into what it is but
[3:38] just uh to touch it just for a moment
[3:40] because i believe it's important
[3:42] you're gonna find that in close to
[3:45] almost 24
[3:46] be two dozen places in the bible
[3:49] especially the old testament but also
[3:50] the new testament
[3:52] god refers to himself as the god of
[3:55] abraham isaac and jacob
[3:59] i'm sure you've read that before in your
[4:00] bible and
[4:02] you find it in genesis 12 abraham
[4:05] receives this blessing
[4:06] and god gives him this promise and
[4:08] promises him i'm going to bless you
[4:11] and it's it's going to it's going to
[4:13] surpass and transcend you it's going to
[4:15] go all through all the generations of
[4:16] the earth
[4:18] god reaffirms that same promise that he
[4:20] gave to abraham
[4:22] to his son isaac and then god affirms it
[4:24] again
[4:25] to isaac's son jacob and
[4:29] even in the book of acts you'll find
[4:31] this
[4:32] that god that peter after he heals the
[4:36] lame man
[4:37] declares that it was done by the god of
[4:39] abraham
[4:40] isaac and jacob so we know it's a
[4:42] covenant
[4:43] that god makes with abraham and
[4:46] it's important to us just to to briefly
[4:50] say this it's pertinent important to
[4:53] us because we are abraham's seed
[4:57] and we're abraham's children now not
[5:00] naturally speaking we're not natural
[5:02] jews but as we read a couple wednesdays
[5:04] ago
[5:05] brother branham says when you leave the
[5:07] world and you separate yourself from
[5:09] everything
[5:10] and you're called out by god he said you
[5:12] are a spiritual
[5:14] jew right so it was a it was a covenant
[5:18] that god
[5:18] gives to abraham you're going to find
[5:21] two threads
[5:23] uh that and and they they both uh
[5:26] are connected to each other running all
[5:29] the way through the old testament
[5:31] and you one thread is the two threads
[5:34] i'm gonna give you the one thread
[5:36] is that god is that the god of the
[5:39] jews the god of the jews
[5:43] is the god of the whole universe
[5:48] everything the stars the galaxies
[5:52] and that thread you'll find throughout
[5:54] the whole old testament that the jews
[5:58] proclaim this you'll find it in job
[6:00] you'll find it a lot in dave when david
[6:02] speaks about the god of jehovah that
[6:04] he's the god of israel so one thread
[6:06] that you'll find running throughout the
[6:07] whole old testament is that the god of
[6:09] the unit
[6:10] the god of the jews is the god of the
[6:12] whole universe and
[6:14] to understand that in those days every
[6:16] nation
[6:17] had a god you'll find in genesis 1
[6:19] through chapter 11
[6:21] all of the nations of the earth and all
[6:23] of the different tribes and all of the
[6:25] different peoples
[6:26] the bible calls them that they had their
[6:28] own
[6:29] god they they they were religious all
[6:32] humanity was religious
[6:34] they were they believed in something
[6:36] whether it was the god of baal and that
[6:38] was the national god or the god of
[6:40] asteroth and that was the national god
[6:42] the god of
[6:43] of isis even uh in the bible
[6:46] that's actually a name of a god uh was a
[6:49] god of the people it was a god of the
[6:51] nations you read about god
[6:53] uh the god of moloch you've read about
[6:56] that before
[6:57] so all wars that happened
[7:00] were religiously motivated
[7:03] they were religious wars about whose god
[7:07] was
[7:07] the most powerful god when you went to
[7:09] war you went
[7:11] by the with your priests you went with
[7:14] your singers
[7:15] you went with whatever kind of religious
[7:18] things that they had to drum up their
[7:20] god or summon their god
[7:23] israel had the ark of the covenant and
[7:25] it was representative of something it
[7:27] was not just
[7:28] a piece of furniture but it was
[7:30] representative of
[7:31] jehovah that when they went to war
[7:34] jehovah went
[7:35] before them and so all wars were
[7:38] religious between one god and another
[7:40] one god one people's god and another so
[7:43] israel
[7:44] was a nation and israel's god was
[7:47] yahweh or jehovah
[7:50] which simply means constant or
[7:54] always jehovah and so
[7:58] the the the the but but differently
[8:02] than any other nation different than the
[8:04] god of the nations of
[8:06] canaan or the nations of the height the
[8:08] hittites or the
[8:09] perizzites israel made a claim to
[8:12] something that no one else did
[8:14] and what israel claimed is that her god
[8:17] was the god of all gods
[8:21] and that's actually in the bible you'll
[8:23] find that phrase in the old testament
[8:24] the god of all gods you go read the
[8:26] isaiah
[8:27] i think it's chapter 40 and isaiah just
[8:30] declares that he's the god of all gods
[8:32] and in fact they go
[8:33] further than the god being uh in fact i
[8:36] think the word is the god above all gods
[8:38] that's the word the king james uses
[8:40] that he's the god above all gods
[8:44] they went further than that and israel
[8:46] said that not only is he the
[8:48] god above all gods but our god is the
[8:51] only god
[8:54] that all of the gods are of human uh
[8:56] imagination
[8:57] that they're not real that our god is
[8:59] the god of
[9:01] all gods but he's also the only god
[9:04] and they went further than that and said
[9:07] that
[9:08] not only did our god create but he also
[9:12] maintains the entire universe and that
[9:15] god who created the entire universe
[9:18] and maintains the entire universe is our
[9:20] god
[9:22] it's a bold claim it's a big claim
[9:26] our god is not just you have your gods
[9:28] our god is
[9:29] not just the god of all gods he's the
[9:31] god what god referred to the one who
[9:33] created the world
[9:34] the one who created the stars the one
[9:36] who created the existence of humanity of
[9:38] all the trees of everything that you see
[9:41] israel says that's our god now you may
[9:44] have yours of wood hay and stubble and
[9:46] you may have moloch and bell and
[9:48] asteroth but this is our god
[9:50] and our god is the god above all gods
[9:52] isaiah chapter 40 is the
[9:54] is the is the chapter there where you'll
[9:56] find isaiah declaring that job declares
[9:58] that
[9:59] david especially as we said in the
[10:01] psalms
[10:02] declares that so that's one thread the
[10:05] thread being
[10:06] that the god of the jews is the god of
[10:10] the whole universe
[10:12] the other side of that thread is that
[10:15] the god of the universe
[10:17] is the god of the jews say what's
[10:20] different from the man
[10:21] because it's one thing for the jews to
[10:23] say
[10:24] our god is the god of the universe it's
[10:26] another thing for the god of the
[10:27] universe to say
[10:29] i'm that people's god amen
[10:32] and so you'll find those two threads
[10:34] running throughout the old testament
[10:36] that
[10:36] the jews are saying our god is the god
[10:39] is the only god above all gods he's the
[10:41] god of the universe
[10:42] the other threat is that the god of the
[10:44] universe is the god of the jews
[10:46] and they were really claiming the jews
[10:49] that the creator of everything the stars
[10:51] the galaxy everything that you see
[10:54] that that god actually made a very
[10:58] personal relationship and
[11:01] intimate relationship with
[11:04] one family amen wow now i hope you
[11:08] follow this
[11:09] that that this was their claim that that
[11:11] one god
[11:13] all nations have their gods that one god
[11:16] had a personal intimate relationship
[11:19] with
[11:19] one little group of people
[11:23] on the whole earth that the god
[11:27] of the stars that the god of the
[11:30] galaxies that the god of orion and the
[11:32] god of the moon and the god of the sun
[11:35] had became the god of the jews
[11:40] and the bible actually identifies him
[11:42] and god identifies himself
[11:45] as one with that family god
[11:48] identifies and god let me say this way
[11:50] god was not embarrassed or ashamed
[11:53] to actually call himself because as we
[11:55] said it was one thing for them to say
[11:57] that
[11:57] but when god reveals himself to moses
[12:00] god reveals himself and says i am the
[12:03] god
[12:04] of abraham isaac and jacob
[12:09] and so god is not embarrassed but
[12:11] actually identifies himself
[12:13] think about this he identifies himself
[12:16] with a grandfather
[12:18] a father and a son
[12:21] three people abraham
[12:24] isaac and jacob and god identifies
[12:28] himself as the whole god of the universe
[12:30] and it doesn't pick the entire spectrum
[12:32] of the whole planet and everybody who's
[12:34] breathing air
[12:35] but he says i'm the god of these three
[12:38] individual
[12:39] men these generations of men
[12:43] the god of the entire universe was now
[12:46] calling himself
[12:47] the god of abraham isaac amen
[12:51] and jacob incredible
[12:54] let me go just a little bit further can
[12:56] you imagine
[12:58] how that was so offensive
[13:01] to other people oh yeah amen imagine how
[13:04] offensive that would be
[13:06] to other nations and other people wow
[13:09] that you were claiming he's our god
[13:11] we're his people and
[13:12] worthy that god identifies himself only
[13:15] with one family with the one people
[13:17] it's an incredible claim and so
[13:21] uh what what you'll find is as we said
[13:24] these two threads run through the entire
[13:26] bible that the god of the jews is the
[13:27] god of the universe and the god of the
[13:29] universe is the god
[13:30] of the jews and so you understand
[13:34] this by the book of genesis because it's
[13:37] in the book of genesis that you ex get
[13:39] the explanation
[13:41] of a god of abraham isaac if you don't
[13:43] have the book of genesis
[13:45] imagine your bible if you started with
[13:46] exodus
[13:48] you would just think it's just a it's
[13:49] just about this god
[13:51] uh you you would just think this claim
[13:53] is just it's just about
[13:54] exodus on through would just be about a
[13:56] god of the jews
[13:58] but genesis says no it's the god of the
[14:01] whole
[14:01] universe who has become the god who
[14:04] created the world
[14:06] and created the stars in this days of
[14:08] creation has become the god of this
[14:11] jewish people
[14:13] you get that from the book of genesis
[14:16] and that god calls himself by just three
[14:19] men who belong to a tiny group of people
[14:21] called the jews now remember this is
[14:24] just a little bit of teaching here
[14:26] the book of genesis let me just pull
[14:28] this up on my phone here
[14:30] the book of genesis
[14:34] covers a massive span
[14:39] of history in fact the book of genesis
[14:43] covers
[14:44] more time than every other book of the
[14:47] bible put together
[14:50] one book that time has been
[14:53] compressed into because it's going to
[14:56] cover
[14:57] centuries and centuries and generations
[15:00] and generations
[15:01] of people and so
[15:04] let me just find my place here so
[15:08] you you find this from exodus to
[15:11] revelation let me just get that
[15:13] from exodus to revelation it covers
[15:16] about
[15:16] give or take 1500 years if you if you if
[15:19] you study
[15:20] uh what scholars believe covers exodus
[15:22] to revelations about 1500 years
[15:24] whereas genesis covers the entire
[15:26] creation of the world
[15:28] covers the entire creation days of
[15:31] creation the existence of mankind
[15:33] from the beginning all the way to joseph
[15:37] so it's massive much longer centuries
[15:40] and centuries
[15:41] of people and so what you realize when
[15:44] you read the book of genesis is that
[15:46] time has been compressed
[15:48] in the book of genesis it covers
[15:50] centuries
[15:52] as compared to the rest of the bible uh
[15:55] it's a much
[15:55] longer period of time genesis chapter
[15:59] one
[16:00] we all know really well through chapter
[16:03] 11 and let me just if i had this on a
[16:06] chart i would
[16:06] i could show you this visually but just
[16:09] i'm just going to say it here
[16:11] genesis chapter 1 through chapter 11
[16:15] that's a very short section of your
[16:16] bible if you just if you open your bible
[16:18] and you hold to chapter 1 to chapter 11
[16:21] it's a very small
[16:22] portion especially genesis you have
[16:24] chapter 12 through chapter 50.
[16:26] so chapter 12 through chapter 50 is a
[16:29] much larger portion of the book and
[16:30] what's interesting
[16:31] is that chapter 1 through chapter 11
[16:35] is a covers a massive amount of time
[16:39] i mean centuries of time in just 11
[16:42] chapters
[16:43] and it covers many people just mentions
[16:47] them
[16:48] it doesn't give all the history of
[16:50] everything you don't find the history of
[16:51] every nation and everybody and what
[16:53] everybody did and the record of every
[16:55] act
[16:55] we couldn't contain that in the book but
[16:58] it covers
[16:59] many nations many people uh uh and
[17:02] and and many many many uh in a in a
[17:05] massive amount of time that's chapter 1
[17:08] through chapter 11. but then chapter 12
[17:13] through chapter 50
[17:16] actually only covers a very short amount
[17:18] of time
[17:19] amen and it basically only really speaks
[17:22] about
[17:23] four men really that's it chapter 11
[17:26] through 11 covers
[17:28] many people many nations and a massive
[17:30] amount of time chapter 12 through
[17:32] chapter 50 covers just a little
[17:35] space of time about four men abraham
[17:39] isaac jacob joseph
[17:42] and joseph is completely different than
[17:43] the rest of the three god never calls
[17:45] himself the god
[17:46] of joseph there's a reason for that
[17:48] there's a significance about joseph
[17:50] that was very different we're not going
[17:51] to get into that today but god
[17:54] calls himself by these three men abraham
[17:58] isaac and jacob you say brother matt why
[18:00] is that chapter 1 through 11
[18:01] massive amount and all the history of
[18:03] the earth and all the history of
[18:05] creation
[18:06] and then you come to chapter 12 and what
[18:08] god does very deliberately i want you to
[18:11] realize it's very deliberate
[18:13] god zooms in amen
[18:16] and he focuses on one family
[18:21] he zooms in from the entire world
[18:24] and all of its people down to just one
[18:28] family you say why is that important
[18:30] because you're seeing
[18:32] history from god's perspective
[18:36] this is how god looks at history this is
[18:39] how god looks at
[18:40] you may not like it may not you may
[18:43] think it's unfair
[18:44] god was going to zoom in on one family
[18:46] but it's what god chose to do
[18:48] and he zooms in very deliberately on the
[18:50] lives
[18:51] of these men and gives you the life of
[18:54] abraham
[18:55] who let god gives a promise to and he
[18:56] leaves the land of er and he promises in
[18:59] you
[18:59] i'll bless you and all the nations of
[19:01] the earth be blessed and then he covers
[19:02] the life of isaac
[19:03] and he gives that same promise to isaac
[19:05] then he goes to the life of jacob
[19:07] and you get all these chapters about all
[19:09] these stories about all these men no one
[19:11] else
[19:11] everybody else is left out mostly
[19:16] and he covers this zoomed in perspective
[19:20] and god begins dealing god has a purpose
[19:24] god has a plan remember the bible is is
[19:28] is the is the answer or the solution to
[19:30] god's problem
[19:31] not man's problem man's man thinks that
[19:34] the bible oh
[19:35] you need jesus you you're feeling
[19:37] desperate i got something for you it's i
[19:39] got the the answer to your problem
[19:41] you're feeling lonely got the answer to
[19:42] that got a man who could help you
[19:44] but it's it's really the god the the
[19:46] bible
[19:47] is about god's solution to his problem
[19:51] how do you get an entire creation of
[19:53] people in humanity who are disobedient
[19:55] to you
[19:58] who don't listen to you
[20:01] i heard a preacher one time say he said
[20:02] it's amazing he says the
[20:04] you know the god says to the god says to
[20:07] the uh
[20:08] to the flowers bloom and they blew and
[20:10] he says then god speaks to the trees
[20:12] grow and they grow
[20:14] he says then god speaks to the wind blow
[20:16] and it blows
[20:17] god speaks to the rain rain and it rains
[20:20] god speaks to man and
[20:21] man says no
[20:25] it's the only part of creation who says
[20:27] no and becomes disobedient to the
[20:29] creator
[20:31] and so what does god try first god you
[20:34] say how do you
[20:35] you get man who's so corrupted and man
[20:37] goes so far off in depravity
[20:40] and after after the fall uh the bible
[20:43] says that men begin to call upon the
[20:45] name of the lord the children of seth
[20:46] begin to call upon the name of god
[20:48] and those people who call upon the name
[20:50] of the lord are important to god
[20:52] because those are the people who god can
[20:54] accomplish his purposes through
[20:58] and god begins to and man corrupts
[21:00] himself and so what does god do
[21:04] god first wipes them out wipes them off
[21:08] destroys the earth by a flood
[21:12] you know what happens no one gets off
[21:14] the ark he gets drunk
[21:18] and exposes himself so
[21:21] does wiping it out starting from scratch
[21:24] fix the real problem
[21:25] no because the real problem is a nature
[21:28] a lull of sin
[21:30] inside of man amen and so wiping it out
[21:33] and start from scratch the problem will
[21:35] still exist
[21:36] so what does god decide after the flood
[21:38] god reveals himself
[21:39] and god has a promise and he starts to
[21:42] accomplish his purpose
[21:44] because god has a purpose and god has a
[21:46] plan and he starts to very deliberately
[21:49] deal with this
[21:50] the entire uh uh uh plan and purpose of
[21:54] god
[21:54] all the way through the constant me all
[21:56] the way through redemption
[21:58] with abraham god begins his promise
[22:02] and says get up get thee out of thy land
[22:05] and out of that country
[22:06] unto a land that i will show thee and he
[22:10] reveals himself when moses
[22:12] as we said at the beginning god reveals
[22:13] himself by that name
[22:15] god chose one family to bring his plan
[22:18] through
[22:19] the scholars as we said the scholars
[22:23] call this the scandal of particularity
[22:26] and you can go and and read all about it
[22:28] i'm not going to teach
[22:29] on this on the you know the uh the
[22:32] intellectual point of view from that
[22:34] but the basis is why did god choose the
[22:38] jews
[22:40] why why would he choose
[22:44] one people and if he was going to choose
[22:47] one people
[22:48] and one nation why abraham
[22:52] why the jews in our rationale we always
[22:55] have to have an answer for everything
[22:57] there had to be something why didn't he
[23:01] choose the chinese that's the scandal of
[23:02] particularity why didn't he just choose
[23:04] the chinese to save the chinese
[23:06] why did he choose the americans that
[23:07] would save their own self then he would
[23:09] choose the you know the the british to
[23:12] save the british why
[23:13] one nation to save the whole world
[23:16] because that is what god that is god's
[23:18] plan
[23:19] i hope you catch that that is god's plan
[23:22] god was going to use one family to save
[23:25] the rest of the world
[23:27] through one seed everybody else would be
[23:29] redeemed
[23:33] they're one family through one promise
[23:35] one promise god made it to men
[23:37] but why did god choose to save the whole
[23:40] world through one
[23:42] jewish people two two poets
[23:46] wrote very short little one's name was
[23:48] william norman
[23:50] ooher i hope i'm pronouncing his ur name
[23:53] last name right
[23:55] and one of them was called cecil brown
[23:57] two poets who
[23:58] wrote very short poems
[24:02] and william norman ooher wrote this poem
[24:04] it's very popular
[24:06] with the scandal of particularity it's a
[24:07] very popular poem it's very short
[24:09] very simple and here's his poem
[24:13] how odd of god
[24:17] to choose the jews that's it
[24:23] how odd of god
[24:26] to choose the jews so along came cecil
[24:29] brown and he was going to add a second
[24:31] verse to that poem and here's what cesar
[24:34] brown said
[24:35] but not so odd as those who choose
[24:40] a jewish god but spurned the jews
[24:47] amazing so
[24:51] you say brother matt why didn't why did
[24:53] god choose to choose
[24:56] let me give you the most profound answer
[24:58] get your pins
[25:00] get your get your ipads get your
[25:02] smartphones get ready to take it down
[25:04] here's why god
[25:05] chose the jews because
[25:09] that was his
[25:12] choice
[25:17] and people don't like it but it's his
[25:20] choice
[25:22] and and and educational systems decry
[25:26] against it
[25:27] social justice cries against it
[25:30] god would choose one people and one
[25:32] nation but here's why
[25:34] it was god's choice that's why he's
[25:37] calling himself
[25:39] the god of abraham the god of isaac the
[25:42] god
[25:43] of jacob and so genesis just as we close
[25:46] genesis chapter 12 through chapter 50 as
[25:49] we said
[25:50] are basically the stories of four men
[25:52] abraham isaac and jacob and joseph
[25:55] and three of them grouped together one
[25:57] is very different
[25:58] three generations of people
[26:01] and and what's amazing is as you look at
[26:04] these three men
[26:05] there's a counterpoint for each of them
[26:08] for each
[26:10] abraham isaac and jacob there's a
[26:12] counterpoint for
[26:14] each of them the counterpoint to abraham
[26:17] is his nephew lot
[26:21] amen right remember how brother branham
[26:25] talked about in the book of revelations
[26:26] he says that the spirit speaks to both
[26:28] the true vine and the false vine
[26:31] remember that and he says so in the book
[26:34] of revelation you're hearing god
[26:35] speak to both lines remember in the
[26:38] beginning
[26:38] was twins brother adam says there's
[26:41] twins out of every revival there's two
[26:43] lines running throughout all of the
[26:45] beginning of history
[26:46] runs through the middle of history runs
[26:48] to the end of the old testament the new
[26:50] testament begins with those same two
[26:52] lines and it ends all the way in the
[26:54] book of revelation with those
[26:56] same two lines they're not physical
[26:58] bloodlines because if it comes down to
[27:00] physical
[27:00] blood man we are all in trouble
[27:03] all of us as we're a mixture of
[27:07] of of all kinds there's no pure
[27:10] bloodline god's not looking for a
[27:12] natural pure bloodline
[27:14] but there was a line of children jesus
[27:17] calls them of obedience
[27:20] and children of disobedience
[27:23] the children of the light the children
[27:26] of the darkness
[27:27] it's amazing when you look at this even
[27:30] in abraham's life
[27:31] there was lot as a counterpoint to
[27:33] abraham
[27:34] abraham lot
[27:38] then there was a counterpoint to isaac
[27:40] isaac
[27:41] and then his stepbrother ishmael
[27:45] and then there was a counterpoint to
[27:46] jacob jacob
[27:50] and his twin
[27:53] you see that yeah it goes from nephew
[27:57] to stepbrother to twin
[28:00] a little bit closer and closer and
[28:04] closer
[28:06] it's like the relationships of those
[28:07] from nephew to step brother
[28:09] to twin get closer and closer you know
[28:12] what it's showing it's showing as we
[28:14] said throughout the entire bible
[28:16] there's two lines running through the
[28:19] human race
[28:21] and they're in stark contrast
[28:24] to each other and you
[28:27] throughout the entire bible it's an
[28:29] invitation to line yourself up with
[28:32] one of two lines are you in abraham
[28:36] or are you a lot are you a jacob
[28:40] or are you an isaac or are you an
[28:42] ishmael
[28:43] are you a jacob or are you an esau
