[45:35] remind us of
[45:36] the wound
[45:38] and

[45:43] agreeing with satan
[45:45] and uh forgetting to look at the

[45:49] what he's actually pointing at is
[45:51] actually healed over and it's a scar now
[45:53] so it's not a wound
[45:55] so uh
[45:57] it's pretty much he's he's putting out
[45:59] his own he's pointing out his own
[46:00] failure

[46:39] her
[46:40] music and her fashion
[46:42] her hollywood and passion
[46:45] can stimulate the flesh
[46:48] just like wine
[46:52] [Music]
[46:55] and all the while she pulls us all away
[47:00] from
[47:00] everything divine
[47:06] but i have
[47:08] heard voice
[47:11] calling me
[47:12] out of babylon
[47:16] [Music]
[47:19] to a higher place
[47:23] there's a mountain i can live upon
[47:31] and i have made my choice

[48:21] she stands against revival
[48:24] the truth within the bible
[48:28] binding hungry hearts with chains of
[48:31] fears
[48:36] and somehow makes confusion of the word
[48:41] god
[48:43] [Music]
[48:52] calling me
[48:54] out of babylon
[48:59] [Music]
[49:01] to a higher place
[49:05] there's a mountain i can live upon
[49:13] and i have made my choice
[49:17] jesus
[49:21] [Applause]
[49:26] babylon will never

[1:26:22] we haven't even
[1:26:23] made a a call but people have come
[1:26:26] and you know
[1:26:28] that's god
[1:26:30] moving on hearts you can't
[1:26:32] remember paul said the human mind is
[1:26:34] enmity against god i could never agree
[1:26:36] with god you can't force a young person
[1:26:39] really a teenager in that awkward state
[1:26:41] with all their peers around to step out
[1:26:44] come up and in front of everybody
[1:26:45] weeping and crying and all the audience
[1:26:48] weeping and crying you can't it takes
[1:26:50] god to do that
[1:26:52] brother john doesn't have enough
[1:26:53] charisma to make that happen he's got it
[1:26:56] but he doesn't have enough to do that
[1:26:57] but that is god doing that i'm always
[1:27:01] keenly aware that it takes the holy
[1:27:04] spirit to do that
[1:27:06] so i want to say thanks and we've still
[1:27:08] got this service and then afternoon

[1:35:35] and we've saw this
[1:35:37] the lord jesus use your church this week
[1:35:40] this hasn't been a local meeting
[1:35:42] it's been uh for many that has gone some
[1:35:45] have already gone away back to their
[1:35:47] home churches and are song leading and
[1:35:50] in their local assemblies and it hasn't
[1:35:52] been a local meeting
[1:35:54] this has been uh all of us
[1:35:56] even the services that's been spoken
[1:35:59] there's been hundreds hundreds of people
[1:36:01] that have viewed those services so it's
[1:36:03] not just
[1:36:04] those on this property or at this
[1:36:06] address
[1:36:08] you know um
[1:36:10] there was a lot of lyft drivers and
[1:36:13] uber and taxi cab drivers last night
[1:36:16] that came by here and
[1:36:18] hallelujah picked up all you drunk
[1:36:20] people
[1:36:22] hallelujah y'all woke up in your motel
[1:36:24] or in your house and but isn't it great
[1:36:26] to serve the lord
[1:36:29] if you don't know what i meant you have
[1:36:30] to go back and hear the service amen
[1:36:33] we want to fall in love with jesus
[1:36:36] i i know many in this local church isn't
[1:36:39] even here today
[1:36:40] they're streaming and they made room for
[1:36:43] us
[1:36:44] and we really appreciate that
[1:36:47] and uh
[1:36:49] i shook hands with a father that's at a
[1:36:51] motel with his wife and
[1:36:54] streaming he wanted his children to be
[1:36:56] at the service he didn't want to hinder
[1:37:00] but they're streaming so their young
[1:37:01] people can be here and sit and i think
[1:37:03] that's good sometimes
[1:37:05] young people just need to hear the word
[1:37:07] with
[1:37:08] out a dad or mom or somebody screaming
[1:37:10] behind him i'm not saying that's
[1:37:12] negative i'm just
[1:37:13] saying sometimes we just need to get our
[1:37:15] children in an atmosphere so
[1:37:18] the physician can touch them
[1:37:20] you understand what i mean
[1:37:22] i had two things on my heart
[1:37:24] for this morning
[1:37:26] and uh praying and i was getting ready
[1:37:28] in my room alone and
[1:37:31] i said lord it would take a miracle it
[1:37:34] would just take god to do those things
[1:37:37] and already today it's already happening
[1:37:40] the very people that we were praying for
[1:37:43] and i said brother jason it was going to
[1:37:46] take a miracle
[1:37:47] i can't even do that
[1:37:49] the lord's already done it in the
[1:37:50] service
[1:37:52] two people specifically
[1:37:55] isn't he great
[1:37:58] so this is our last meeting and
[1:38:01] we don't want to be long
[1:38:03] and so let's just stand and turn to the
[1:38:06] book of psalms chapter 103
[1:38:09] and and then malachi chapter 4
[1:38:15] uh two places
[1:38:17] psalms 103
[1:38:20] these are some of the greatest times of
[1:38:21] your life
[1:38:24] sacred sands like this and
[1:38:26] meetings like this and
[1:38:28] to have a church open
[1:38:31] hallelujah
[1:38:34] i mean will people want to pray with you
[1:38:36] people love you
[1:38:39] people want you to go on the rapture
[1:38:42] no one's bitter
[1:38:44] no one's against you
[1:38:46] you just come in and
[1:38:48] it's all good like here's your chair
[1:38:50] here's your seat
[1:38:52] what can we do to make you feel
[1:38:53] comfortable
[1:38:56] because we want you to go out change
[1:39:02] we don't want you to be the same
[1:39:06] that's why we have these meetings and we
[1:39:07] come
[1:39:08] is because we want all of you to make it
[1:39:14] and if there's anything we've said
[1:39:16] or done that's offended anyone i'm sorry
[1:39:19] sometimes we have to become fools
[1:39:23] in front of you so that we would maybe
[1:39:25] win somebody's heart
[1:39:27] you understand
[1:39:30] sometimes we have to like be foolishness
[1:39:34] to win somebody over
[1:39:37] and that's okay i think you understand
[1:39:41] psalms 103 verse 1 to 5
[1:39:44] this is the psalm of david he said bless
[1:39:47] the lord o my soul
[1:39:49] and all that is within me bless his holy
[1:39:51] name
[1:39:53] bless the lord
[1:39:54] o my soul
[1:39:56] and forget not all his benefits
[1:40:00] hallelujah
[1:40:03] his benefits don't forget them this
[1:40:06] morning
[1:40:07] verse 3 who forgiveth
[1:40:09] some
[1:40:10] of your iniquities
[1:40:13] is that what your bible says
[1:40:15] no who forgiveth all thine iniquities
[1:40:19] those are things that you did that you
[1:40:21] knew was wrong that you shouldn't have
[1:40:23] done you did it anyway
[1:40:25] god says i just forgive you
[1:40:28] and there's things that you're not doing
[1:40:29] that you should have been doing and
[1:40:31] you're neglectful
[1:40:32] and you say man that's going to do me
[1:40:34] forever and god's saying nope i'm going
[1:40:36] to forgive you of that
[1:40:38] isn't that great
[1:40:40] who healeth all
[1:40:42] thy diseases
[1:40:44] praise god
[1:40:46] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[1:40:50] who crowneth thee with loving kindness
[1:40:53] and tender mercies
[1:40:55] isn't this wonderful
[1:40:57] god's dress where amen
[1:41:00] god's armament
[1:41:03] um god's speaking to you in a certain
[1:41:05] way
[1:41:06] because he loves you
[1:41:08] and he puts gifts in the church
[1:41:10] that can say things a certain way
[1:41:13] to just you know
[1:41:16] he's crowning you with loving kindness
[1:41:18] and he's tender
[1:41:21] he's wonderful
[1:41:22] he's in this building right now
[1:41:26] verse 5 who satisfieth thy mouth with
[1:41:30] good things so that thy youth
[1:41:34] is renewed
[1:41:35] like the eagles
[1:41:37] isn't that wonderful
[1:41:39] david saw this he was a shepherd so he
[1:41:41] knew what it was like to have sheep
[1:41:43] that needed to go by
[1:41:46] cool waters and waters that were just
[1:41:48] like uh
[1:41:50] he leadeth me beside still waters
[1:41:52] because
[1:41:53] sheep get nervous
[1:41:55] and you can't have them always going by
[1:41:57] rushing
[1:41:59] water it's still water it's just rushing
[1:42:01] fast and the currents going
[1:42:04] david knew
[1:42:06] that sheep needed to go by waters that
[1:42:08] were just
[1:42:09] slowly or just barely moving because
[1:42:11] they're nervous lions are after them
[1:42:14] tigers are after them
[1:42:16] foxes and you just need to come by a
[1:42:18] place where you can hear the word
[1:42:21] and it can impact you
[1:42:23] hallelujah
[1:42:25] malachi chapter 4
[1:42:28] i had you seated
[1:42:30] earlier so you'd have a little strength
[1:42:32] to just stand with us as we read malachi
[1:42:34] chapter 4
[1:42:38] verse 1
[1:42:40] the last chapter of the old testament
[1:42:44] for behold
[1:42:45] let's say behold
[1:42:47] the day cometh that shall burn as an
[1:42:50] oven
[1:42:53] and all the proud
[1:42:55] yea
[1:42:56] and all that do wickedly and brother
[1:42:58] branham stopped here
[1:43:00] and said when he when the bible says all
[1:43:03] the proud and he says like the americans
[1:43:06] and so forth
[1:43:09] so they're all proud
[1:43:11] and then they all have it on their
[1:43:13] church signs and out on their signs when
[1:43:15] there's an emergency pray pray pray but
[1:43:18] when things get back going
[1:43:20] no they're just right back to their
[1:43:22] worldly things
[1:43:24] so
[1:43:25] there is a day coming though
[1:43:27] when all the proud ye and all that do
[1:43:29] wickedly shall be stubble and the day

[1:47:01] knowing that god has a word for us
[1:47:04] do y'all remember last night brother
[1:47:06] branham was remembering speaking to
[1:47:07] young people
[1:47:09] several months later on june the 1st
[1:47:11] 1963
[1:47:13] he said i remember when those angels
[1:47:15] came down on the mountain i remember
[1:47:17] what was said and especially about the
[1:47:20] young people so any real ministry
[1:47:23] that is uh working operating in the
[1:47:26] third pool ought to be dealing with
[1:47:28] young people there ought to be a feeling
[1:47:30] there ought to be a heart
[1:47:31] there ought to be compassion there ought
[1:47:34] to be a willingness to lean down
[1:47:36] anybody that's great knows how to humble
[1:47:38] themselves
[1:47:40] get out of the way so that our children
[1:47:43] our grandchildren
[1:47:45] you that are coming in or maybe you've
[1:47:47] heard it before
[1:47:49] and you just maybe
[1:47:51] have slid away a little bit it's time to
[1:47:53] come back
[1:47:55] it's time to be restored
[1:47:57] all that you've been hearing all that
[1:47:59] you know
[1:48:00] it's time to put it in and say god make
[1:48:03] it real in my life
[1:48:05] here's a psalm of david speaking from
[1:48:08] his soul and all that is within me
[1:48:10] but david said in psalms 103
[1:48:14] bless the lord o my soul and forget not
[1:48:16] all his benefits let's all say benefits
[1:48:20] everyone wants to make you know
[1:48:22] six figures hundred thousand two hundred
[1:48:25] thousand they're worried about their
[1:48:26] salary but don't forget about the
[1:48:28] benefits
[1:48:30] you can make a lot of money but you got
[1:48:31] to have gas you're going to have
[1:48:33] insurance you're going to have others
[1:48:34] and if you have a company say i'll pay
[1:48:36] this amount and i'll pay you benefits
[1:48:39] you ought to have a smile on your face
[1:48:40] and say thank you lord
[1:48:43] hallelujah today we ought to say thank
[1:48:45] you lord
[1:48:47] don't forget his benefits that means his
[1:48:49] dealings i put it on the bottom of the
[1:48:51] screen for you don't forget the way that
[1:48:54] god recompenses or he brings benefit to
[1:48:57] your life
[1:48:58] dealing of one's hand upon the way that
[1:49:01] god has handled you as a young lady or
[1:49:04] as a young man has been bright
[1:49:08] even when you've been mishandled things
[1:49:10] have not handled been right or something
[1:49:14] harsh or i want to say this word
[1:49:16] misunderstanding has happened in your
[1:49:18] life god always brings another way to
[1:49:21] restore you back
[1:49:24] god change our attitudes today give us a
[1:49:26] right mental attitude
[1:49:28] toward every promise of god
[1:49:31] all of us have had bad things happen to
[1:49:33] us
[1:49:34] i'm going to get into that and just nail
[1:49:36] it down before we leave one another that
[1:49:38] you can't be a victim the rest of your
[1:49:40] life
[1:49:41] think everything's against you and
[1:49:43] always looking sideways and you know
[1:49:45] crossing bridges before you get there
[1:49:48] and and always thinking somebody's
[1:49:50] following you and and you just get
[1:49:52] nervous and you can't you know be it
[1:49:54] dark because there's always
[1:49:56] you know it's amazing how as a young
[1:49:58] person
[1:50:00] children are like wet cement whatever's
[1:50:03] been impressed upon them is what they
[1:50:05] become
[1:50:07] you put your hand down in concrete like
[1:50:09] that
[1:50:10] and pull it out that's what's going to
[1:50:12] be in the concrete and children are like
[1:50:15] young people are like wet cement
[1:50:17] whatever is impressed upon them is what
[1:50:19] they become
[1:50:20] so thank the lord that in our youth god
[1:50:23] has impressed himself upon our lives
[1:50:26] david said early will i seek thee
[1:50:30] that's early in the morning
[1:50:32] early in the day
[1:50:34] it's good to talk to the lord i'm just
[1:50:36] speaking to you right now good to pray
[1:50:38] in the morning good to have devotion in
[1:50:40] the morning start out with five minutes
[1:50:42] start out with 10 minutes you already
[1:50:44] spent that much time on your cell phone
[1:50:46] anyway before you got to the bathroom
[1:50:48] most of you this morning had already
[1:50:50] checked your cell phone
[1:50:54] can you just pray a little bit before
[1:50:56] you turn on your cell phone you know
[1:50:58] it's just habits it's just daily will i
[1:51:01] seek thee early early in the morning
[1:51:04] early in my youth early when god starts
[1:51:07] dealing with your life
[1:51:09] can the older ones say amen back there i
[1:51:11] mean the scars of life and the things
[1:51:13] that happen and you get run through the
[1:51:16] ring or backwards you know and nobody
[1:51:18] calls you up to sing and you had a song
[1:51:20] ready or you know you have an attitude
[1:51:22] about that why are they already saying
[1:51:24] that person sang three times this
[1:51:26] morning or two times or whatever well
[1:51:28] these are just bad attitudes you know
[1:51:31] but we can get it kind of
[1:51:33] something in our spirit and we just need
[1:51:35] to let that go
[1:51:38] don't forget god's benefits and how he
[1:51:41] has fully dealt with us
[1:51:45] god's been good to
[1:51:46] you does anybody have anything against
[1:51:49] the lord
[1:51:52] i'm asking a question
[1:51:54] because tuesday night it better not be
[1:51:56] where we're lord this lord lord you know
[1:51:59] people have done that adults have done
[1:52:01] that
[1:52:02] lord why and why well we just need our
[1:52:05] hearts god didn't cause all that
[1:52:08] satan brings death
[1:52:10] satan brings trouble
[1:52:13] none of us have a reason to get angry
[1:52:15] with god and just anger and bitterness
[1:52:18] and hatred and you get opposite
[1:52:22] that's what the holy spirit is just
[1:52:23] purging us from in these meetings
[1:52:26] praise god we're sitting right here
[1:52:28] being washed and you might not think a
[1:52:30] lot's happening right now but god is
[1:52:32] just washing somebody
[1:52:35] just cleansing their minds he's like
[1:52:37] weaning a child or weaning a little baby
[1:52:40] it's like god's saying to the young
[1:52:42] people it's time to step into your
[1:52:44] position now
[1:52:46] i put it in my notes days ago to come
[1:52:48] this sunday morning because the lord had
[1:52:50] already laid this on my heart i wrote
[1:52:52] down friday night saturday night and
[1:52:54] sunday morning's title days ago
[1:52:59] and so he had dealt with us to encourage
[1:53:01] the young adults i want to encourage you
[1:53:04] don't leave it all behind the pulpit and
[1:53:06] leave it to the preachers and the older
[1:53:08] ones they've ran their race
[1:53:11] brother john's 49 years old and i've
[1:53:13] said this publicly i'm past my prime i'm
[1:53:16] over the heel
[1:53:19] you might laugh but in the old testament
[1:53:21] at 50 they put the high priest out the
[1:53:24] pasture
[1:53:26] and another pastor said no brother john
[1:53:28] you're in your prime i already know i'm
[1:53:30] over my prime
[1:53:31] i don't need nobody to tell me
[1:53:33] that there's better ministers out there
[1:53:36] there's more young men that are coming
[1:53:38] up and we want to encourage them brother
[1:53:40] matthew
[1:53:41] we don't want to stifle and discourage
[1:53:43] the song leaders
[1:53:45] we need to encourage them and brothers
[1:53:47] that are finding their wings we need to
[1:53:49] give them their wings and
[1:53:51] strengthen the
[1:53:52] church somebody say amen with me amen
[1:53:56] you know we talk a lot about young
[1:53:58] people and young people's meetings
[1:54:00] but sometimes we need older people's
[1:54:02] meetings
[1:54:05] it's like the young people have a
[1:54:06] problem or something we're having youth
[1:54:08] meetings young people special whole you
[1:54:10] know i think sometimes the older ones
[1:54:12] need a change in their attitudes
[1:54:15] come on young people you can say amen
[1:54:16] that's all right
[1:54:18] come on
[1:54:19] sometimes they get stiff and starchy and
[1:54:21] cold and indifferent and always pointing
[1:54:24] fingers at the young people well we're a
[1:54:26] product of them
[1:54:29] the young people is a product of the old
[1:54:31] people's revelation
[1:54:33] so i don't need to know a lot about your
[1:54:36] pastor or your church i've solved the
[1:54:38] young people i already know what goes on
[1:54:40] in this church and other churches in
[1:54:42] this region by seeing your young people
[1:54:45] amen
[1:54:46] for just a few minutes
[1:54:49] you can tell whether they really are
[1:54:51] connected to god
[1:54:53] or is this just church or are we just
[1:54:55] coming together and
[1:54:56] i'm more interested and down next week
[1:54:59] than i am right now
[1:55:00] we need
[1:55:01] men and women to get connected to god so
[1:55:04] that
[1:55:05] monday tuesday wednesday they're
[1:55:06] overcoming they're they're battling the
[1:55:09] the food that came to the prophet in the
[1:55:12] mountain fed him for 40 days
[1:55:15] he didn't need to be traveling to the
[1:55:17] next youth meeting next weekend and the
[1:55:19] next weekend like he he for 40 days the
[1:55:22] fiber of what they were going through

[1:56:03] well jump in

[1:56:06] faster the minute i feel like there's
[1:56:08] kind of something something you know

[1:56:16] channel with me stay focused
[1:56:19] here it is i've had this since friday
[1:56:21] night
[1:56:22] out of the church age book brother
[1:56:24] branham said we see a seventh age
[1:56:26] messenger coming and he's a prophet
[1:56:29] not only do we see this messenger coming
[1:56:31] here in
[1:56:32] revelations 10 7 but we find that the
[1:56:35] word speaks of elijah coming before
[1:56:38] jesus returns
[1:56:39] matthew 17 10 and his disciples ask him
[1:56:43] saying why then say the scribes that
[1:56:45] elias must first come
[1:56:47] and jesus said elias truly shall come
[1:56:50] first and restore all things
[1:56:52] and brother branham said before the
[1:56:54] coming of our lord elijah must come back
[1:56:57] for a work of restoration in the church
[1:57:02] this is what malachi 4 5 says
[1:57:04] behold i will send you elijah the
[1:57:06] prophet before
[1:57:08] let's all say before
[1:57:10] hallelujah the coming of the great and
[1:57:12] dreadful day of the lord and he shall
[1:57:14] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[1:57:16] children and the heart of the children
[1:57:18] to their fathers lest i come and smite
[1:57:21] the earth with a curse
[1:57:24] god help us tonight may there not be one
[1:57:27] person in this building miss the rapture
[1:57:31] we've talked about a rapture for a long
[1:57:33] time we've had meetings for a long
[1:57:35] you've heard a lot of preaching but i
[1:57:38] don't want to be here five minutes after
[1:57:40] the rapture happens
[1:57:42] five minutes the first five minutes
[1:57:45] after the rapture happens and a person
[1:57:47] realized they missed it
[1:57:49] that'll be enough hell
[1:57:51] for someone that's been raised in the
[1:57:52] message
[1:57:53] [Applause]
[1:57:56] to know that all they sang about talked
[1:57:58] about
[1:58:00] they missed it
[1:58:02] y'all know what i'm talking you talk
[1:58:04] about the something coming over you
[1:58:06] you'll feel like blowing your brains out
[1:58:08] the bible talks about they'll cry for
[1:58:11] the mountains to fall on them but they
[1:58:13] won't be why it's in tribulation then oh
[1:58:17] my loving brother and
[1:58:18] sister let's make sure we're in the
[1:58:21] bosom
[1:58:22] of someone that's not going to cast you
[1:58:25] the next morning like a wadded up piece
[1:58:27] of paper into another garbage can like
[1:58:29] you're another number
[1:58:31] that's what the world treats you that
[1:58:33] that's what sex will do for a young
[1:58:35] person before they're married
[1:58:37] you're just another number you're just
[1:58:39] another lust
[1:58:40] spirit that's been manifest and then you
[1:58:43] have unborn children and you have things
[1:58:45] that go on scars for years god's trying
[1:58:48] to protect some of you don't go that way
[1:58:52] i'm looking down the road to some of
[1:58:54] your marriages and some of your families
[1:58:58] that's why i preach like this
[1:59:01] it's not a feel-good gospel sometimes
[1:59:03] it's it's a rugged road
[1:59:06] it's a rugged road
[1:59:08] and the martyrs brothers and sisters
[1:59:10] before you and i they were going to the
[1:59:12] stake
[1:59:14] like this to be burned at the stake
[1:59:16] these are young people and they're just
[1:59:18] leaning over saying you don't need to
[1:59:19] tie my hands
[1:59:23] that's the spirit that was on them
[1:59:25] to lay down their life i'm not going to
[1:59:27] run i'm not going to run away you don't
[1:59:30] need to tie my hands and they just some
[1:59:32] of them they just gave and they just
[1:59:33] stood there and the flames are licking
[1:59:35] up around them and they just gave their
[1:59:37] life freely
[1:59:39] some of us run and maybe run in this
[1:59:41] morning
[1:59:43] and you have it so easy
[1:59:46] why would you delay another afternoon
[1:59:48] without the lord jesus
[1:59:51] i think this would be a fantastic
[1:59:52] afternoon
[1:59:54] for the whole weekend and everything
[1:59:55] just to be right that you can just say
[1:59:57] lord
[1:59:58] put your arms around me
[2:00:00] fill me i want to go home with something
[2:00:03] in my script bag in my little bag and i
[2:00:06] want to feel those stones of strength
[2:00:09] and revelation that god's given me
[2:00:12] personally
[2:00:14] put oil in me so that i'm not always
[2:00:16] needing it for someone else
[2:00:18] the wise virgins had oil
[2:00:21] and there'll come a time when you'll go
[2:00:23] to a brother or sister at a special
[2:00:25] meetings wanting the holy ghost and you
[2:00:27] won't get it it's too late
[2:00:33] and we sense the spirit of god lifting
[2:00:35] off even the meetings and and people
[2:00:37] wonder why the enthusiasm and why the
[2:00:39] fire spiritually and why the lack you
[2:00:42] know it can be like this all wonderful
[2:00:44] but what what are you talking about in
[2:00:46] your dorms what are you talking about in
[2:00:48] your
[2:00:49] motel rooms what are you talking about
[2:00:51] in your bedrooms when you're with one
[2:00:52] another what kind of pictures are you
[2:00:54] sending what kind of words are you
[2:00:57] texting what kind of
[2:00:59] movies are you watching i shouldn't even
[2:01:01] say that
[2:01:02] [Applause]
[2:01:04] brother branham said blow it out with a
[2:01:05] shotgun well some of you would have a
[2:01:07] hard time getting a shotgun down on your
[2:01:09] watch that's on your arm
[2:01:12] your little apple watch or your little
[2:01:13] whatever you're more connected than
[2:01:16] people were years ago there was dick
[2:01:18] tracy moby dick whatever they was like
[2:01:21] some sci-fi thing today some of you or
[2:01:24] teenagers or young people have more on
[2:01:26] your arm than they did years ago and
[2:01:28] brother brown said blow it out with a
[2:01:29] shotgun
[2:01:32] some of you are texting in church shame
[2:01:34] on you
[2:01:35] i'm talking about people that are in the
[2:01:37] congregation
[2:01:40] we ought to be connecting to god
[2:01:42] [Applause]
[2:01:43] if that device it takes up more of your
[2:01:46] time and just look at it i don't want to
[2:01:48] offend you but have has it drawn you
[2:01:51] closer to the lord
[2:01:56] this is the time of your youth
[2:01:58] don't waste it and look back you know in
[2:02:01] your 20s and say man i was so foolish i
[2:02:04] i just was so foolish i didn't
[2:02:06] understand it hadn't really hit me
[2:02:08] that's what i was doing to the lord
[2:02:10] jesus but may it strike us now
[2:02:12] let's get more serious about god i'm
[2:02:15] encouraging you today
[2:02:17] this is a revival
[2:02:21] so brother branham quotes the scripture
[2:02:23] there is absolutely no doubt
[2:02:25] that elijah must return before the
[2:02:27] coming of jesus he has a specific work
[2:02:30] to accomplish and that work is the part
[2:02:33] of malachi 4 6
[2:02:36] and i want everyone to listen
[2:02:38] he will turn the hearts of the children
[2:02:40] to their fathers
[2:02:44] the reason that we know this is his
[2:02:46] specific work to do is that
[2:02:48] is because he has already accomplished
[2:02:51] the part that says
[2:02:53] he shall turn the hearts of the fathers
[2:02:55] to the children
[2:02:57] when elijah when the elijah ministry was
[2:03:00] here in john the baptist
[2:03:03] because luke 1 17 says he shall go
[2:03:05] before him in the spirit and power of
[2:03:08] elias to turn the hearts of the fathers
[2:03:10] to the children and the disobedient to
[2:03:13] the wisdom of the just to make ready a
[2:03:15] people
[2:03:17] prepared for the lord in the ministry
[2:03:19] here it is
[2:03:21] in the ministry of john
[2:03:24] the hearts of the fathers
[2:03:26] were turned to the children yeah amen
[2:03:29] i'm just doing a little bit of teaching
[2:03:31] because i'm fulfilling joel 2 that in
[2:03:34] the same month there will be a former
[2:03:36] and ladder rain there'll be teaching
[2:03:37] there'll be a rain there'll be teaching
[2:03:39] there'll be inspirational don't worry
[2:03:41] i'll get there but right now we need to
[2:03:43] grow and say god
[2:03:45] i'm willing to tread some water i'm
[2:03:47] willing to bear the yoke i'm willing to
[2:03:49] be taught here
[2:03:50] part of malachi is the hearts of the
[2:03:53] fathers would be turned to the children
[2:03:56] but we're living in the last part this
[2:03:58] is what i'm trying to get to you
[2:04:00] we know that because jesus said so it
[2:04:03] does not say that the hearts of the
[2:04:05] children were turned to the fathers this
[2:04:07] is yet to take place
[2:04:10] the hearts of the last day children will
[2:04:13] be turned back to the pentecostal
[2:04:15] fathers
[2:04:16] not the hollywood fathers
[2:04:21] not what movie you're watching or where
[2:04:23] you're going to school or what your
[2:04:25] career is and who you're going to marry
[2:04:28] god wants to turn your heart back to the
[2:04:30] word to our pentecostal fathers
[2:04:34] john got the fathers ready for jesus to
[2:04:37] welcome the children into the fold now
[2:04:40] this prophet william branham
[2:04:43] [Applause]
[2:04:44] is that okay
[2:04:46] i'm not adding to the word it's it's
[2:04:47] peter standing up saying this is that
[2:04:52] it's not just brother jason demars that
[2:04:55] needs to say that i believe in a prophet
[2:04:57] that's come to term you ought to be able
[2:04:59] to say
[2:05:00] god has sent me a prophet
[2:05:03] i'm talking about you
[2:05:05] i send you that ought to be so personal
[2:05:07] and wonderful
[2:05:09] and you're not ashamed of it
[2:05:11] and i don't care if they make 387
[2:05:14] websites more this year than last year
[2:05:16] against it
[2:05:18] you don't have time for it you're
[2:05:19] focused in you're lasered in
[2:05:22] god sent me a prophet that's turning my
[2:05:26] heart back so that's why i listen to it
[2:05:29] every day
[2:05:34] now this prophet upon whom the spirit of
[2:05:36] elijah falls will prepare the children
[2:05:39] to welcome back jesus let's all go like
[2:05:42] this
[2:05:43] welcome back jesus you say how are you
[2:05:45] all going to get ready god sent us a
[2:05:47] message god sent us a prophet
[2:05:50] you're a predestinated seed
[2:05:52] even though you've wondered
[2:05:55] you've wondered
[2:05:56] and even though you've wondered you've
[2:05:58] wondered
[2:05:59] god has not forsaken you
[2:06:02] and he has not treated you nor i the way
[2:06:05] we deserve to be treated
[2:06:08] somebody say amen to that
[2:06:10] if you were treated the way you deserve
[2:06:12] to be treated we'd all deserve hell
[2:06:15] but god rich in mercy says i'm going to
[2:06:18] forgive you of your iniquities
[2:06:21] and your sins and your transgressions
[2:06:24] see
[2:06:24] that's where you know i'm not into just
[2:06:26] always having to read three chapters a
[2:06:28] day or five chapter you know just stop
[2:06:30] right there and say god has forgiven my
[2:06:33] iniquity
[2:06:34] when you read isaiah when it says by his
[2:06:37] stripes you are here say by his stripes
[2:06:39] i am healed
[2:06:41] and i have an acne issue i have a a a
[2:06:44] learning disability i have a problem
[2:06:47] sleeping my mind is just going crazy
[2:06:50] lord i need peace
[2:06:51] what if some of you actually started
[2:06:53] praying like this lord give me your
[2:06:55] peace
[2:06:56] not as the world giveth but give me your
[2:06:59] peace
[2:07:00] it's not just here today and gone
[2:07:02] tomorrow and up
[2:07:04] naturally we will struggle through life
[2:07:08] and battle certain seasons when satan
[2:07:10] comes against us
[2:07:13] and there's times we need doctors
[2:07:15] there's times we need nurses
[2:07:17] brother branham believed in medicine
[2:07:21] there was a man that brother branham was
[2:07:23] close to that
[2:07:25] started having problems and it's because
[2:07:27] the man thought he had so much faith and
[2:07:30] he just thought taking medicine was
[2:07:33] not having faith and brother branham
[2:07:35] picked that up and i think it was a
[2:07:36] phone call and his first question was
[2:07:39] this have you been taking your medicine
[2:07:42] amen
[2:07:44] and we need to remind ourselves that
[2:07:46] luke was a physician
[2:07:49] and they actually used that against i
[2:07:51] think it was paul
[2:07:53] that why are you carrying around with
[2:07:54] you a physician when you're saying we
[2:07:56] believe in divine healing
[2:08:00] moving on
[2:08:04] in topeka kansas brother branham said if
[2:08:06] we could only do that tonight people
[2:08:09] if we could only realize that he let's
[2:08:12] say he
[2:08:13] he is appearing to us in these meetings
[2:08:16] for one purpose
[2:08:18] that's to release our desires
[2:08:21] that we have in him
[2:08:24] to us
[2:08:27] that's the reason why he appears in
[2:08:29] youth meetings
[2:08:31] like this
[2:08:32] is to release our desires that we have
[2:08:36] in him
[2:08:37] to us
[2:08:38] say but i don't have that
[2:08:40] i don't have that that's why he's
[2:08:42] appearing to us in these meetings is to
[2:08:45] release it to us
[2:08:47] somebody say praise the lord that's why
[2:08:50] i said receive it receive it because
[2:08:52] it's god trying to help you
[2:08:54] brother brown said people would be dying
[2:08:56] on the doorsteps
[2:08:58] the hospital is inside the physicians
[2:09:00] and your help's on the inside and
[2:09:02] they're dying on the on the doorsteps
[2:09:08] but
[2:09:09] we've got to recognize his presence
[2:09:13] and now
[2:09:14] how you recognize his presence is when
[2:09:16] the promised word for this age
[2:09:19] this age
[2:09:21] is made manifest not the promised word
[2:09:24] for moses age or any of the other ages
[2:09:28] but the promise of the word for this age
[2:09:32] oh i just feel inspired right there
[2:09:34] you are the generation
[2:09:37] in the message
[2:09:38] that's alive right now that's going to
[2:09:41] be here at the coming of the lord
[2:09:44] amen god knew that he predestinated that
[2:09:47] so
[2:09:48] you're not second class you're not third
[2:09:51] class you're not god has not forgotten
[2:09:53] you
[2:09:56] when you feel like you're all alone
[2:09:58] you're not alone he said i will never
[2:10:00] leave you i will never forsake you and
[2:10:03] you got to do school by zoom or you
[2:10:06] you've been distanced for a while some
[2:10:08] of you need to learn to get back to
[2:10:09] worship and praise and feeding off the
[2:10:12] word and saying hallelujah because
[2:10:14] you've been in your room you've been
[2:10:15] distancing you've been can't go to
[2:10:17] church can't have youth meetings and
[2:10:19] sometimes it's like an eagle we need to
[2:10:21] stretch our wings
[2:10:23] and let the renewing power be released
[2:10:26] on us
[2:10:28] hallelujah just let it flow some of you
[2:10:31] in this building have taken drugs before
[2:10:33] i know i've heard some testimonies you
[2:10:35] know what it's like to be on a high
[2:10:38] oh man y'all are quiet
[2:10:42] or y'all are angels right y'all were
[2:10:44] born with the holy ghost you have no
[2:10:46] problem you've never gone down that
[2:10:48] pathway
[2:10:50] drugs and alcohol where a person's just
[2:10:52] under the influence
[2:10:54] well what's that's on the negative
[2:10:56] that's what satan has done to pervert
[2:10:58] the human where they just get under the
[2:11:00] influence and then they come out and
[2:11:02] they can't even be normal so they want
[2:11:04] that high again well what's wrong with
[2:11:06] that in the spiritual where you just
[2:11:08] feed on god and love his presence and
[2:11:11] cry a little bit and praise him a little
[2:11:14] bit
[2:11:18] you might as well start feeling
[2:11:19] comfortable around here because this is
[2:11:21] what heaven's gonna be like and
[2:11:24] if you're just kind of always you know
[2:11:26] kicking against it and
[2:11:28] you know
[2:11:29] then you're not going to feel
[2:11:30] comfortable in heaven this is heaven
[2:11:33] this is heavenly places
[2:11:35] he's trying to bring it down to you
[2:11:38] and i to release to us
[2:11:42] we're not earthlings we're not human
[2:11:44] beings only we're sitting in chairs some

[2:18:34] there's needs in the body that he's
[2:18:35] trying to get you to get out of the way
[2:18:39] so that he can use you to touch somebody
[2:18:42] else that's down the pew
[2:18:44] it's not all the preachers
[2:18:46] we don't need superstar preachers they
[2:18:49] have it in sports they have it you know
[2:18:51] they'll come out and they'll fill
[2:18:52] stadiums to see their star
[2:18:56] that ought to stop in the message
[2:18:59] we're superstar preachers and then you
[2:19:01] know draw a crowd it ought to be
[2:19:03] following
[2:19:04] jesus that ought to be where we're
[2:19:06] lifting up jesus where
[2:19:09] he's all i need
[2:19:14] where he's he's cultivating love in our
[2:19:16] life and aspirations and longings and
[2:19:19] wishes something deep that's why he's
[2:19:21] appearing to us in these meetings is to
[2:19:24] do these things that i've put on the
[2:19:25] screen for you
[2:19:27] do you all appreciate this the reason i
[2:19:29] put these on the screen is i think you
[2:19:31] get more out of it
[2:19:33] if we could only do that tonight people
[2:19:35] if we could only realize he's appearing
[2:19:37] to us in these meetings for one purpose
[2:19:40] i put it on twice
[2:19:42] to release our desires things that were
[2:19:44] in you that you didn't even know about
[2:19:46] but it's there
[2:19:49] i wanted to go back a little bit and
[2:19:50] show you something from the welsh
[2:19:52] revival
[2:19:55] 1904 is this okay
[2:19:59] something that happened
[2:20:01] and it wasn't an ordinary church service
[2:20:04] it was
[2:20:05] a bunch of young people
[2:20:07] that had got together because they were
[2:20:09] hungry and thirsty for a revival
[2:20:13] and even the late the young lady that
[2:20:15] her pictures in front of you probably
[2:20:17] wouldn't win a beauty contest can you
[2:20:19] all see that
[2:20:20] she wouldn't be miss america or miss
[2:20:22] peru or miss whatever
[2:20:25] of the universe
[2:20:28] probably wouldn't win that but here's
[2:20:30] flora evans
[2:20:32] she was a teenager
[2:20:34] between 16 18 years old from a certain
[2:20:37] place who in this meeting
[2:20:40] she publicly confessed that she loved
[2:20:42] the lord jesus christ with all her heart
[2:20:46] she did this in the morning youth
[2:20:48] meeting at her church
[2:20:50] her simple words
[2:20:52] and this is what happened flora
[2:20:54] was in the service and all of a sudden
[2:20:56] she just lifted up her hands and stood
[2:20:59] and said lord i love you with all of my
[2:21:01] heart
[2:21:04] and in that meeting when she said that
[2:21:08] those simple words were the spark that
[2:21:10] lit revival fire in her church
[2:21:14] and in the west wales area this is the
[2:21:16] wales welsh revival
[2:21:19] a fire that would soon become national
[2:21:21] in its scope these words were spoken on
[2:21:24] sunday february 14 1904 were to be the
[2:21:27] first drops of an international downpour
[2:21:33] not a preacher not a pope not some it
[2:21:36] was a young lady she was a teenager she
[2:21:38] lord i love you with all of my heart
[2:21:42] and the holy spirit fell there in wails
[2:21:45] and over a hundred thousand souls were
[2:21:47] one to christ
[2:21:49] here's another man that probably most of
[2:21:51] us would pass over he needs to maybe
[2:21:53] trim his mustache a little better
[2:21:55] brother seth i love you but this is back
[2:21:58] in these days
[2:22:02] and it's september of the same year 1904
[2:22:05] where an evangelist his name was seth
[2:22:07] joshua was addressing a convention which
[2:22:10] included these young people is this all
[2:22:12] right
[2:22:13] i'm trying to influence 2021 young
[2:22:16] people i'm trying to influence
[2:22:18] the message young people i'm trying to
[2:22:20] show you revivals in the past how god
[2:22:22] used young people
[2:22:24] and and this
[2:22:26] uh evangelist was speaking at a
[2:22:28] convention and some of these young
[2:22:29] people they had young ladies and young
[2:22:31] men that were in prayer meetings and
[2:22:33] they were singers at the certain place
[2:22:36] and seth himself had been praying for
[2:22:38] years
[2:22:40] that god would raise up a young man from
[2:22:42] the pits the coal pits is what he's
[2:22:44] talking about the pits to revive the
[2:22:47] churches
[2:22:48] little d did he know that on thursday
[2:22:51] september 29 1904 his prayer was to be
[2:22:56] answered in a life-changing experience
[2:22:58] for one
[2:22:59] 26-year-old student his name was evan
[2:23:02] roberts
[2:23:05] here's evan
[2:23:06] i'll show you
[2:23:09] i've seen a documentary on evan
[2:23:11] he was just possessed it was like he
[2:23:13] tried to go to school he tried to work
[2:23:15] it just he had to work in the pits he
[2:23:18] tried to go to school and he's just
[2:23:20] just in his mind he was just possessed
[2:23:22] with the revival the coolness of the
[2:23:24] church it's cold and
[2:23:26] things and evan roberts just a man that
[2:23:29] was
[2:23:30] 26 year old a student and so during 1904
[2:23:33] this evangelist seth joshua had been
[2:23:35] holding missions all over wales
[2:23:37] including one at newcastle emeline where
[2:23:40] he first came in contact with evan
[2:23:42] roberts
[2:23:44] it was a prayer
[2:23:47] so brother seth is having a convention
[2:23:50] some of these young people were there in
[2:23:51] this certain city
[2:23:53] let's just say beaufort
[2:23:56] south carolina
[2:23:58] but this was a place in wales
[2:24:01] and seth was praying
[2:24:04] and it was in this prayer that seth
[2:24:06] begin to pray
[2:24:08] bend me o lord
[2:24:15] bend me o lord
[2:24:21] bend me
[2:24:25] it was like a groaning like he wasn't
[2:24:28] satisfied and going in the same
[2:24:30] direction bend me oh lord
[2:24:34] where are the young people
[2:24:36] now brother john's coming into this
[2:24:38] building speaking to you right where are
[2:24:40] the young men
[2:24:42] where are the young ladies
[2:24:44] and brother seth was at a convention but
[2:24:47] it was in a prayer he just been me
[2:24:50] he didn't care about the crowd or how
[2:24:53] much money the offering was or what
[2:24:55] people thought about him he'd got far he
[2:24:57] was broken he was just humbled he was
[2:25:00] weeping
[2:25:03] bend me lord
[2:25:05] is there someone is there a young man
[2:25:08] that can take this torch
[2:25:14] and evan roberts was in that service and
[2:25:16] it so affected him it so touched him
[2:25:19] that became a prayer and a motto so what
[2:25:21] was in the older generation was passed
[2:25:24] to the younger generation of fire and
[2:25:27] love and i want to show you here this
[2:25:29] was the revival with youth on fire
[2:25:34] young men yes and young women
[2:25:36] i was up this is what i was doing
[2:25:38] between one and two i was putting his
[2:25:40] name sydney evans and annie davies on
[2:25:43] this slide so somebody in this building
[2:25:45] could say god i want that fire
[2:25:48] that's what brother john was doing after
[2:25:50] one o'clock i was putting i put it on
[2:25:52] there so that you all could see it a
[2:25:54] little bit i knew the pictures are a
[2:25:55] little hazy i'm not preaching history
[2:25:59] i'm trying to put some flame into
[2:26:00] somebody's heart what what he did before
[2:26:03] he can do today
[2:26:04] he's doing today
[2:26:06] this is another book of acts
[2:26:12] sydney evans and even annie you'd say
[2:26:14] annie annie needs a little song or she
[2:26:16] needs a little revival that's fine but
[2:26:19] i'm showing you a photo these were real
[2:26:21] young people
[2:26:22] this was the welsh revival this was over
[2:26:24] a hundred thousand souls were one to
[2:26:27] christ
[2:26:28] in that generation and i just want to
[2:26:30] stop right here because i know this is
[2:26:32] our last service god send us a holy
[2:26:34] ghost revival
[2:26:36] [Applause]

[2:26:42] it's already happening
[2:26:43] brother john already said that on friday
[2:26:45] night this year of 2021 has been a great
[2:26:48] outpouring of god's spirit with young
[2:26:51] people and youth meetings and churches
[2:26:53] that are hungry they're thirsty god we
[2:26:56] don't want to get in a rut we don't want
[2:26:58] to get cold and indifferent and i and i
[2:27:01] hear the cry
[2:27:03] and i believe your cry has touched the
[2:27:06] heart of god

[2:28:30] then going in the valley living on the
[2:28:32] mountain going

[2:28:39] mountain
[2:28:40] fruits are growing in the valley
[2:28:44] i'm speaking to you
[2:28:46] i'm like a doctor in the room talking to
[2:28:48] you privately

[2:28:52] it gets cold that's where the snow is i
[2:28:55] live near a mountain mount baker and
[2:28:57] there's snow up there most the time of
[2:28:59] the year
[2:29:00] i don't live in the mountain
[2:29:03] i might go visit the mountain
[2:29:05] and we've had fantastic experiences in
[2:29:08] the mountain but i've got to leave the
[2:29:10] mountain
[2:29:11] and come back home

[2:29:39] potatoes and get the fruits of the
[2:29:41] spirit it's not on the mountain
[2:29:45] god gives us mountaintop experiences but
[2:29:48] whenever you get to the mountain you'll
[2:29:50] always see that there's more
[2:29:51] mountaintops there's more valleys
[2:29:54] and you've got to leave the mountain and
[2:29:56] go down into the valley
[2:29:58] and none of you wanted to hear that this

[2:32:29] off
[2:32:30] satan knows he's got his last chances

[2:32:36] slippery slope of snow and he's grabbing
[2:32:39] for every person and everything that he
[2:32:40] can but he's not gonna grab you you need

[2:33:21] on somebody i don't care what your name

[2:33:34] up in a service and say i love you lord

[2:33:45] thinks
[2:33:47] lord give us this generation a holy
[2:33:49] ghost revival
[2:33:51] and burn me up lord if you've got to put
[2:33:53] me down and set me aside you'll raise up
[2:33:56] somebody else

[2:34:00] preaching to your young people invite
[2:34:02] them next year brother matthew
[2:34:05] don't invite me
[2:34:07] there's another brother that's in the
[2:34:08] channel can catch what the people need
[2:34:10] what the young people need that can
[2:34:12] minister not over their heads but in
[2:34:14] their hearts then you invite that
[2:34:15] brother we're not fooling around
[2:34:18] and it might be somebody that don't
[2:34:20] agree the same as matthew or brother
[2:34:22] jason or brother jason it might be
[2:34:24] somebody else that maybe opposes you or
[2:34:27] is different but they can reach the
[2:34:29] young people invite them
[2:34:33] it's amazing we can talk about preachers
[2:34:35] and talk about the pastor and
[2:34:37] everything's negative and nothing's ever
[2:34:39] good
[2:34:40] and you wonder why your young people
[2:34:41] have no trust in no one
[2:34:44] we need to shut up our mouth sometimes
[2:34:46] that might be the very brother that can
[2:34:48] help your young lady
[2:34:50] or we'll reach your young man six months
[2:34:53] from now
[2:34:55] to too much bad things too many murders

[2:35:03] as we should so it's around the kitchen
[2:35:05] bar or around your little snack or a
[2:35:07] little comment

[2:38:55] how did we get on baseball you've taken
[2:38:57] five minutes out of the service
[2:39:00] no wonder we've been preaching two hours
[2:39:01] honey sorry baby
[2:39:07] because you all must be on your cell
[2:39:08] phones and playing baseball and football
[2:39:10] and i'm not against none of that i'm
[2:39:11] just talking your language
[2:39:13] but when we come to the house of god god
[2:39:15] give us a real revival
[2:39:17] so that when we go home there's
[2:39:19] something burning
[2:39:20] something burning
[2:39:22] youth that care youth that are gripped
[2:39:25] youth that are excited youth that are
[2:39:27] interested
[2:39:28] youth that are engaged and by the way i
[2:39:31] have that in my notes so
[2:39:33] i'm reading my notes i'm staying focused
[2:39:35] youth that are focused
[2:39:37] youth that respect youth that are
[2:39:39] patient youth that admire youth that are
[2:39:42] humble maybe i'm speaking some
[2:39:44] attributes that you need to be we'll
[2:39:46] just reach out and grab it
[2:39:49] why is he appearing to us in these
[2:39:50] meetings it's to awaken these desires
[2:39:54] make us humble make us patient make us
[2:39:56] willing to learn
[2:39:58] let us be willing to be quiet and shut
[2:40:00] our mouths and listen
[2:40:03] and listen
[2:40:05] i need to do better than that if you
[2:40:07] ever get married
[2:40:10] you're going to have to learn
[2:40:13] i'm not looking at my wife
[2:40:15] you're going to have to learn how to
[2:40:16] listen
[2:40:18] shame on us we don't listen very good
[2:40:21] well just turn up your hearing aid
[2:40:22] brother john you know i don't have a
[2:40:24] hearing aid i probably need one
[2:40:29] god give us a group of young people that
[2:40:32] live deeper
[2:40:33] and aren't a bunch of surface feeders
[2:40:38] forgive us if we've been lazy
[2:40:41] forgive us if we're proud for or
[2:40:42] sarcastic
[2:40:45] i'm coming into your prayer life these
[2:40:48] are things that at the end of the
[2:40:50] service
[2:40:51] when they close that you just kind of
[2:40:52] bow your head and say i'm just going to
[2:40:54] linger here for a minute
[2:40:55] lord forgive me for being lazy
[2:40:59] forgive me if i've been sarcastic
[2:41:02] forgive me if i've been rude and hasty
[2:41:05] and arrogant lord
[2:41:07] forgive me if i've been a bad dude with
[2:41:10] a bad attitude
[2:41:12] and i hope my three year old grandson
[2:41:15] ain't listening
[2:41:17] we have this little phrase he's a cool
[2:41:19] dude with an attitude
[2:41:20] and then he started saying it i said
[2:41:22] lord forgive me
[2:41:24] i finally changed it to he's a great big
[2:41:27] man with a great big plan
[2:41:31] because he's going around he's a cool
[2:41:33] dude with a manitou
[2:41:39] we influence one another i'm like oh
[2:41:41] lord forgive me jesus
[2:41:44] isn't it great to serve the lord
[2:41:45] [Applause]
[2:41:47] and so i did a little video clip of him

[2:41:51] brother john's over here talking about
[2:41:53] you got shoes i got shoes yeah oh god
[2:41:56] and he i get a little video of my three
[2:41:58] year old grandson sitting at the table

[2:42:03] praise god
[2:42:06] hallelujah
[2:42:08] we all girls got sandals boys got shoes
[2:42:14] right no
[2:42:16] nice sandals
[2:42:17] birkenstock
[2:42:25] i know sister your goodness is
[2:42:27] i don't know
[2:42:31] my neither
[2:42:33] don't be ashamed of him in this
[2:42:34] generation
[2:42:36] sinful perplexed
[2:42:38] the last generation that'll ever be on
[2:42:40] the earth is sinful adulterous full of
[2:42:43] petrified source
[2:42:45] oh everything that's been decent has
[2:42:47] become indecent this is your prophet is
[2:42:49] that true
[2:42:51] national politics filth nations are
[2:42:54] broke up
[2:42:55] way back in the jungles of africa and
[2:42:58] safari hunters they had to take
[2:43:00] high-powered radios to hear elvis
[2:43:03] presley pat boone and them guys with
[2:43:05] that rock and roll and the twist and the
[2:43:08] natives trying to see them act along
[2:43:10] jerking
[2:43:12] jerking
[2:43:13] their head and acting like that the
[2:43:15] natives stood and looked at him but you
[2:43:17] see
[2:43:18] they're not americans like pat boone and
[2:43:20] elvis presley
[2:43:22] and ricky nelson
[2:43:26] amen and i'm trying to think of some
[2:43:28] popular singers you know
[2:43:31] justin bieber and whoever
[2:43:34] he thinks he's a christian
[2:43:38] he's deceived
[2:43:40] if he's going to be in the rapture and
[2:43:42] in heaven right beside you then why
[2:43:44] would god hold you to another standard
[2:43:48] if all the women in the world that wear
[2:43:50] pants earrings and this live a lot and
[2:43:52] smoke
[2:43:54] i had a manager one day when when i was
[2:43:56] younger she smoked she wore pants
[2:43:59] cut hair and everything i'm going to
[2:44:01] heaven she said i know i'm going to
[2:44:03] heaven
[2:44:04] if that's what we believe then why do we
[2:44:07] hold such a standard
[2:44:09] why is there such a holiness it's
[2:44:11] because not all those people that say
[2:44:12] they're going to heaven are going to
[2:44:14] heaven
[2:44:15] and even people with dresses and long
[2:44:17] hair and if our attitude stinks and uh
[2:44:20] and our spirit's wrong we're not going
[2:44:22] to the rapture either
[2:44:24] so it's not how you dress and what you
[2:44:26] do but if you have the holy spirit it'll
[2:44:29] come out in your
[2:44:30] dress so they're not americans like
[2:44:33] these other things but they're not
[2:44:34] judases of that type but they're
[2:44:38] see
[2:44:39] it's a spirit
[2:44:41] he's putting his finger right on it
[2:44:43] it's a spirit
[2:44:46] and the spirit is not only in america
[2:44:49] this is 1965.
[2:44:51] the spirit is not only in america
[2:44:54] it's been spread itself out over the
[2:44:56] world to bring them to the battle of
[2:44:58] armageddon now if that's true on the
[2:45:01] negative what about the positive
[2:45:04] can god do something that's global
[2:45:08] it's a global wave
[2:45:11] it's a global
[2:45:12] revival you're not an elite group
[2:45:15] because you're in america i'm sorry
[2:45:18] i'm really sorry
[2:45:20] we're not elitist
[2:45:24] hey
[2:45:25] amen
[2:45:29] i got about half of you with me
[2:45:32] america is not the promised land
[2:45:35] and the american dream
[2:45:37] yep it's had a huge pin put in the
[2:45:40] bubble
[2:45:42] the economy the you talk about a little
[2:45:45] virus has shut down the world
[2:45:48] and not just churches shut down stadiums
[2:45:54] amen so you think oh man it's getting a
[2:45:57] degree it's making money yeah a lot of
[2:45:59] those people just sat at home and
[2:46:01] collected unemployment or whatever
[2:46:04] it's more of jesus we need
[2:46:08] if it's gone global in the negative then
[2:46:10] there's a global revival
[2:46:12] happening amongst the message young
[2:46:14] people
[2:46:15] they act like that whatever nation they
[2:46:17] come from africa india wherever it is
[2:46:20] that vulgar and stuff
[2:46:22] that's a lot of stuff
[2:46:25] when the lord comes don't worry about
[2:46:27] your stuff
[2:46:29] that's luke 17.
[2:46:31] jesus said
[2:46:32] don't go back and get your stuff
[2:46:35] remember lot's wife she looked back
[2:46:39] she wanted to cut her hair
[2:46:41] she wanted to be part of a society
[2:46:44] she thought she could wear those kind of
[2:46:46] skirts and get away with it and she
[2:46:48] didn't know that the
[2:46:50] pages of adultery
[2:46:52] that she's going to stand at the day of
[2:46:54] judgment
[2:46:55] of of people that have committed
[2:46:57] adultery with i've never committed
[2:46:59] adultery with that person but you did
[2:47:02] and the only way to erase those pages is
[2:47:06] to ask god to forgive you
[2:47:08] and put it under the blood
[2:47:10] that's the only way you can be saved
[2:47:14] i know i'm long this morning
[2:47:17] but if the blood covered every single
[2:47:19] person wouldn't that be fantastic
[2:47:21] wouldn't that be great if the death
[2:47:23] angel came through beaufort and just
[2:47:26] passed over pass over when i see the
[2:47:28] blood i'll pass over you
[2:47:31] because the pentecostal church and these
[2:47:33] other churches there they they quit
[2:47:35] after a certain time and they go out and
[2:47:37] they're
[2:47:37] smoking out back the young girls
[2:47:41] and they're just running off doing this
[2:47:42] and that yeah we got them all fooled
[2:47:44] yeah yeah yeah and they're going on a
[2:47:46] fast track in the wrong direction thank
[2:47:48] god for conviction
[2:47:50] thank god for a mom or dad that will say
[2:47:52] just a second here you know some of you
[2:47:54] need to go back home and say mother i

[2:48:06] but don't stumble over the simplicity
[2:48:11] it's been spread all over the earth by
[2:48:13] just one man starting it
[2:48:15] negative
[2:48:17] one man started it
[2:48:18] so has the gospel and the power of god
[2:48:21] almighty god has spread around the world
[2:48:24] and the separation time is now taking
[2:48:27] place hello everybody wake up everybody
[2:48:32] the separation time has now taken place
[2:48:35] where god is calling a bride and the
[2:48:38] devil is calling a church

[2:48:42] bride and the young people said
[2:48:46] let me part of the bride

[2:49:45] that's real and they they want to feel a
[2:49:48] part
[2:49:48] of something that's winning
[2:49:50] i wrote this in the last days coming
[2:49:53] into these meetings i'm going to say
[2:49:54] them before i close
[2:49:56] every person has been made to be part of
[2:49:59] something that's winning
[2:50:00] that's why they wear t-shirts property
[2:50:02] of blah blah blah and that's why they
[2:50:04] stand and cheer that's why they want to
[2:50:06] identify with a winner that's why
[2:50:08] they're attracted to sports
[2:50:10] that's why they are attracted to romance
[2:50:13] because they want love
[2:50:15] that's why people are attracted to
[2:50:16] social media and internet addiction
[2:50:19] they're it's like connected it's like
[2:50:21] we're connected
[2:50:22] it's because god has made you
[2:50:24] to feel connected to someone somewhere
[2:50:27] and you can be in your little room and
[2:50:29] feel like you're connected to so and so
[2:50:31] and so and so and i put out this and i'm
[2:50:33] going to the
[2:50:34] washroom i ate cheer and people want to
[2:50:37] post and people want to post and
[2:50:39] and
[2:50:43] they have a need to feel connected
[2:50:45] and they're not connected
[2:50:48] they're so socially
[2:50:51] um yes but
[2:50:53] they don't even know how to talk
[2:50:55] they try to go out and have a
[2:50:56] conversation
[2:50:58] they can't look you in the eye
[2:51:00] they're embarrassed
[2:51:03] you know they're looking buzz
[2:51:06] and they're so
[2:51:07] nervous and they got to get out of this
[2:51:09] it's because of internet social media
[2:51:11] and you don't even realize it's a side
[2:51:13] effect
[2:51:15] and they can't carry on a conversation
[2:51:17] and they're nervous and yeah okay we
[2:51:20] gotta go where you going i don't know i
[2:51:21] just gotta go
[2:51:24] and they rush by you and they'll drive
[2:51:26] really fast here
[2:51:28] and then you meet him at the red light
[2:51:29] you pull up
[2:51:33] and their truck is going
[2:51:35] [Music]

[2:52:05] what's on that device i always thought
[2:52:08] if someone from 300 years ago was
[2:52:10] resurrected
[2:52:12] and and looked at people on the
[2:52:13] airplanes or in their and they just
[2:52:16] caught a little video through their into
[2:52:17] their office and they've been sitting
[2:52:19] there in front of this object what is
[2:52:21] that thing i don't know but they've been
[2:52:23] looking at it for the last hour and 28
[2:52:25] minutes

[2:53:10] that's about how foolish it is
[2:53:13] it would be like one of those martyrs
[2:53:15] that gave their life
[2:53:17] and they see some of us and what we do
[2:53:19] in our spare time

[2:54:41] they want to feel like they're important
[2:54:44] and they have an important part to
[2:54:46] fulfill wouldn't it be fantastic
[2:54:48] if we all changed our attitude
[2:54:50] and just felt like every person that we
[2:54:53] met today and this afternoon is very
[2:54:55] very important
[2:54:57] god bless you brother
[2:54:59] it's nice being with you this weekend
[2:55:01] god bless you brother what's your name
[2:55:04] god bless you brother

[2:55:13] hallelujah you're brave to be on the
[2:55:15] front row man god bless you
[2:55:18] if we just had a little bit more
[2:55:20] compassion and feeling
[2:55:23] you say brother john you're really
[2:55:24] strange no brother branham talked to his
[2:55:26] own wife like this
[2:55:28] and they were walking down the streets
[2:55:30] of of uh jeffersonville doing some
[2:55:33] shopping
[2:55:34] and and and then somebody walks by and
[2:55:36] sister bryan went like this smiled and
[2:55:38] hey that lady that lady she you didn't
[2:55:41] greet her she was wanting to greet i
[2:55:42] smiled at her oh man brother brown said
[2:55:45] what's wrong with a good handshake
[2:55:49] yeah give me some skin
[2:55:51] matthew's going to start that give me
[2:55:52] some skin
[2:55:54] a few months ago i was like
[2:56:01] we couldn't have had this a year ago
[2:56:03] this these meetings
[2:56:07] and and two months from now it might be
[2:56:09] shut down
[2:56:10] they talk about another wave or another
[2:56:12] variant
[2:56:13] but what's wrong with another wave of
[2:56:15] the holy ghost
[2:56:17] just another wave
[2:56:18] another way
[2:56:20] another way
[2:56:25] so it's time for us to go brother
[2:56:27] jason's already back there he's already
[2:56:29] supporting me
[2:56:31] i told the brothers in the booth start
[2:56:32] going like this
[2:56:34] he said i would never do that oh
[2:56:37] okay
[2:56:39] so this weekend i introduced you to this
[2:56:41] place
[2:56:42] that one year ago this coming week my
[2:56:45] mother and father's anniversary i took
[2:56:47] them to olive garden
[2:56:49] i mean maybe this is for you brother
[2:56:51] rhett
[2:56:53] and i we're at the olive garden and i
[2:56:56] looked across and saw this place
[2:56:58] and i started to read care
[2:57:02] and the wound healing center
[2:57:04] the wound healing center
[2:57:07] the wound healing center
[2:57:10] huh
[2:57:12] and i thought that's amazing
[2:57:14] do you mean the people in the world
[2:57:16] have a place that people can go to
[2:57:19] when they got wounds
[2:57:21] and
[2:57:22] from that time
[2:57:24] be healed
[2:57:26] and i started to think of young people
[2:57:28] in the message
[2:57:31] is there a place that young people can
[2:57:33] go to
[2:57:34] to be healed
[2:57:37] and notice the title healing
[2:57:40] wound healing we're not here to puncture
[2:57:43] your wounds and punched at your bruises
[2:57:45] i'm not here jesus's ministry was is to
[2:57:48] help those that had been bruised
[2:57:50] the wounded
[2:57:52] you all know luke i think it's luke i've
[2:57:53] come to the brokenhearted that's the
[2:57:56] ministry of jesus
[2:57:59] your heart's broken
[2:58:01] i wish i had another service
[2:58:05] a broken heart
[2:58:07] a person can literally die of a broken
[2:58:10] heart
[2:58:11] physically die
[2:58:13] because their heart's broken
[2:58:21] his broken heart
[2:58:26] but we don't have another service but if
[2:58:28] that's you this morning god will give
[2:58:30] you a new heart and a new spirit
[2:58:34] and brother jason found out a few weeks
[2:58:37] ago
[2:58:38] he could have kept living his life
[2:58:40] thinking everything's okay
[2:58:42] even though i'm breathing a little bit
[2:58:44] kind of i can't even hardly wha
[2:58:46] but if he wouldn't have had some help
[2:58:51] this church might be without
[2:58:53] him being the assistant pastor
[2:58:56] he could have been gone and sister
[2:58:58] debbie we could have been visiting a a
[2:59:01] neighborhood cemetery and maybe brother
[2:59:03] matthew would have been
[2:59:04] the pastor
[2:59:08] but god rich in mercy
[2:59:11] had a doctor
[2:59:12] that was trained
[2:59:14] to put in a splint
[2:59:16] and allow that blood to flow
[2:59:18] and that heart can beat and he can walk
[2:59:20] and he can breathe and he can be your
[2:59:23] pastor a pastor that would invite us all
[2:59:26] to come this weekend and be supporting
[2:59:29] us and cheering us on
[2:59:31] thank you jesus
[2:59:33] and i thought if someone in the world
[2:59:36] can have a wound healing center
[2:59:38] what what about the young people in the
[2:59:40] message that are wounded
[2:59:42] i'm not talking about pediatrics and the
[2:59:45] birthing center
[2:59:47] that's another subject
[2:59:49] i'm talking about young people
[2:59:51] that need healing in another area
[2:59:54] brother brothers brother john has come
[2:59:56] here this weekend with that in our
[2:59:58] hearts
[2:59:59] i hope you understand
[3:00:01] and as i was reminded of this and i
[3:00:04] looked across the parking lot i thought
[3:00:05] surely lord
[3:00:07] you have something for the young people
[3:00:09] of the message
[3:00:10] that they can be healed
[3:00:13] of their wounds healed of
[3:00:16] deep wounds
[3:00:18] scars that happen and things that have
[3:00:21] been said and
[3:00:23] things that have people that's walked
[3:00:24] away from the message and then they make
[3:00:27] big declarations
[3:00:30] by the way that a lot of those came from
[3:00:32] a church that
[3:00:34] that we're right close to our church
[3:00:37] the song leader the the leaders of they
[3:00:40] oh i'm not even going to give them
[3:00:42] credit by giving their website
[3:00:44] but they've turned anti-message and even
[3:00:47] people in this city that used to follow
[3:00:50] the prophet william branham have walked
[3:00:54] away
[3:00:54] because of an influence from thousands
[3:00:57] of miles away
[3:00:59] it's what i just read a few minutes ago
[3:01:01] about it's a spirit
[3:01:03] and it wasn't a few thousand miles ago
[3:01:06] wait it was from the pit of hell
[3:01:08] and it has tried to destroy some of you
[3:01:11] it's put a question in your mind
[3:01:14] that's right it's made some of you have
[3:01:17] to challenge and even ministers take
[3:01:19] whole series
[3:01:20] to try to def and hear what i am to say
[3:01:23] today you don't want those people's
[3:01:26] private life
[3:01:28] you don't want to be married to them you
[3:01:30] don't want to be their son or their
[3:01:31] daughter
[3:01:33] because i can tell you where they're at
[3:01:34] today
[3:01:35] they have gone more crazy
[3:01:37] than just no people that's out in the
[3:01:39] world that you'd say that's a normal
[3:01:41] person out in the they've gone further
[3:01:43] than that
[3:01:45] i'm just giving a testimony if that's
[3:01:48] where you want to go you're just
[3:01:49] dabbling off this and that no you're
[3:01:51] feeding from some fruits that have a lot
[3:01:54] of sin behind it
[3:01:56] no they'd never tell you
[3:01:58] we found jesus
[3:02:00] we've never been so free
[3:02:02] they're free to do whatever they want to
[3:02:04] do just like every single person here
[3:02:07] but i'm happy to be a prisoner
[3:02:10] of jesus christ
[3:02:20] don't worry i'm already part of the hall
[3:02:21] of shame so i don't need to be
[3:02:23] embarrassed about being on the internet
[3:02:27] and here you see
[3:02:28] stages
[3:02:30] of people after a wound
[3:02:33] and if you tried to shake hands with
[3:02:35] this person today on the left
[3:02:38] it'd be blood oh it's tender ooh brother
[3:02:40] sorry
[3:02:42] and volleyball yesterday
[3:02:44] you know
[3:02:48] but you just let some time go by god
[3:02:50] will heal that
[3:02:53] i i was able to look into someone's eyes
[3:02:55] this morning and say i understand
[3:02:59] what they're going through
[3:03:01] because i do understand
[3:03:03] where someone else that hasn't gone
[3:03:05] through that i'm praying for you brother
[3:03:07] and i hope the lord but
[3:03:10] but when you've experienced that kind of
[3:03:12] pain
[3:03:16] amen
[3:03:18] scars
[3:03:20] scars that happen
[3:03:22] it's only evidence and this is where
[3:03:24] when our brother stood over here and
[3:03:26] gave that little short word about the
[3:03:28] song of uh scars what was the title
[3:03:30] again
[3:03:32] he'll say it out loud
[3:03:36] did you really say that
[3:03:37] sing that
[3:03:38] heal the wound
[3:03:40] but he'll what he'll heal the wound but
[3:03:44] are you really serious
[3:03:46] you're willing to have a scar the rest
[3:03:48] of your life
[3:03:50] you think i'm talking to them i'm having
[3:03:52] them repeat it for you
[3:03:54] some of us i don't want that scar
[3:03:56] brother
[3:03:57] i don't want that to happen i live my
[3:03:58] life i'd rather stay in my room because
[3:04:01] there could be an accident there could
[3:04:02] be something happen
[3:04:03] you could get a sickness well if that's
[3:04:05] how you're going to live
[3:04:07] can god really use you
[3:04:09] it's time to have faith and get out of
[3:04:10] your cave and go serve the lord
[3:04:13] die on the front lines
[3:04:16] say that's misaligned faith no it's not
[3:04:18] that's holy ghost revival
[3:04:20] that's what evan roberts had that's what
[3:04:23] seth joshua was preaching at the
[3:04:24] convention bend me lord ben bend us lord
[3:04:28] that's why he's appearing to us in this
[3:04:30] meeting and so that somebody would go
[3:04:33] home and look down at their scar and
[3:04:35] instead of saying ah they're saying oh
[3:04:37] god to god be the glory
[3:04:40] use this for your glory lord
[3:04:43] use the scar use this incident i don't
[3:04:46] know why it happened i don't want it to
[3:04:48] happen again but can you use this for me
[3:04:50] to touch somebody else lord
[3:04:53] because it's something that happened in
[3:04:55] the past but it didn't take your life
[3:04:58] you're still here today
[3:05:00] do i have an audience that's alive
[3:05:03] it's breathing
[3:05:06] then you're not part of that young lady
[3:05:08] that drank too much last night and
[3:05:10] crashed on her way home flipped upside
[3:05:12] down she's gone today you were in a holy
[3:05:15] ghost field meeting you thought you're
[3:05:18] in bondage you thought your brother john
[3:05:20] is just being funny holding you till you
[3:05:22] know 10 o'clock 11 o'clock what are we
[3:05:24] standing here people's coming let's just
[3:05:26] go well maybe god spared you from a
[3:05:29] drunk driver
[3:05:31] our precious prophet was taken by a
[3:05:33] drunk driver
[3:05:38] amen
[3:05:40] if he would have just went to the
[3:05:41] restroom
[3:05:42] at denny's
[3:05:45] that his family ate their last meal
[3:05:47] together brother branham didn't feel to
[3:05:48] eat that last meal
[3:05:51] and he just got in the car and drove
[3:05:53] and billy paul passed his father
[3:06:00] then here comes a card that it's getting
[3:06:02] toward evening time
[3:06:04] and brother billy paul thought it was
[3:06:06] maybe a morning a motorcycle because
[3:06:07] it's just one light coming down and and
[3:06:10] he didn't realize it's a headlight out
[3:06:12] on the driver's side i mean and he
[3:06:14] swerved around and and then all of a
[3:06:16] sudden
[3:06:20] and he looks in his rearview mirror
[3:06:22] that's dad
[3:06:24] that's your prophet
[3:06:26] you see that couldn't have happened our
[3:06:28] prophet not not all mangled up and i've
[3:06:31] seen the car
[3:06:32] all mangled up and and brother brad i'm
[3:06:35] pinned under there and
[3:06:38] she's gone she's gone mother's gone just
[3:06:41] reach my hand over so i can touch her
[3:06:44] do you all know that happened
[3:06:47] and where's my hair billy get my hair
[3:06:49] piece you say
[3:06:51] the paramedics are coming the please get
[3:06:53] my hair piece i don't want to be seen
[3:06:55] like this
[3:06:57] he's about he's in trouble and trauma
[3:07:00] and he's thinking about his hair piece
[3:07:01] you say oh so so vain
[3:07:04] you're the same
[3:07:05] i'm the same we think about our looks
[3:07:08] and how we present
[3:07:10] it's not
[3:07:12] unrighteous
[3:07:14] he's in the last hours of his life he
[3:07:16] wasn't even going to live another week
[3:07:19] amen
[3:07:21] i don't know why i'm saying this
[3:07:23] but it's scars it's wounds
[3:07:27] it's things that happened
[3:07:30] and let me just say this to clarify
[3:07:32] brother branham was not killed by a
[3:07:34] drunk driver
[3:07:36] it was god's will
[3:07:38] that he go at that time
[3:07:40] because if he would still be alive today
[3:07:43] and in jeffersonville there'd be a
[3:07:45] stadium that would seat 180 000 and we'd
[3:07:48] all be living there wanting to see
[3:07:50] brother branham wheeled out on a
[3:07:51] wheelchair
[3:07:53] that's how we all are
[3:07:55] i don't want to offend nobody but god
[3:07:57] took his prophet so that we could have a
[3:07:59] church in beaufort church in florida
[3:08:02] church in georgia church in north
[3:08:04] carolina church
[3:08:12] and so these scars is something that's
[3:08:15] happened in your life but it didn't take
[3:08:17] your life
[3:08:20] and these burns that happen in issues
[3:08:23] and it might take 120 days it might take
[3:08:26] four months for you to come out of this
[3:08:28] brother i'm not going to stand here and
[3:08:30] lie to you
[3:08:33] but greater is he
[3:08:35] that's going to be in you now
[3:08:38] than he that's in the world
[3:08:40] we're not trying to mind over matter
[3:08:42] throwing out the cigarettes and watching
[3:08:45] the fence post that go by so that
[3:08:47] tomorrow when i have the urge i'm gonna
[3:08:48] come back and get because i paid 5.88
[3:08:52] cents plus tax for that brother
[3:08:56] no
[3:08:57] it's saying god take this desire out of
[3:09:00] my life
[3:09:01] give me a nature like yours lord
[3:09:04] bend me lord
[3:09:06] give me a love for your word
[3:09:08] that's greater than these other things
[3:09:11] it's not out it's not
[3:09:13] complicated this you that came forward
[3:09:15] last night a lot of you if you noticed
[3:09:16] brother john said that it's not
[3:09:18] complicated right we me
[3:09:20] we we just think
[3:09:22] it's not complicated sim just believe
[3:09:25] god's word
[3:09:26] drink and push out
[3:09:28] keep drinking the word and push out
[3:09:31] so here this morning as we close

[3:09:42] we're about to leave this afternoon and
[3:09:45] say goodbye
[3:09:47] but for some of you you really need to
[3:09:48] hear these closing remarks
[3:09:51] so i'm going to give them to you

[3:10:31] uh they've taken down that care part
[3:10:34] they've moved away from this medical
[3:10:36] group that was called care
[3:10:40] i don't know why i just gave you some
[3:10:42] information
[3:10:44] it's still the wound healing center
[3:10:47] but i'm glad god never takes away the
[3:10:49] care
[3:10:51] but there has to be time that you went
[3:10:53] in there with a need you talked to the
[3:10:55] receptionist you walked down the

[3:11:08] he talked to you privately
[3:11:10] he left the room you put your clothes
[3:11:13] back on

[3:11:33] and rest
[3:11:35] and stop staying up till two in the
[3:11:37] morning it's killing you
[3:11:39] and you wake up with a headache i'm
[3:11:41] gonna give you a big mystery and unveil
[3:11:43] it you need to drink more water
[3:11:46] i'm serious

[3:11:49] brother john has prayed for thousands of
[3:11:51] people
[3:11:52] headaches migraine headaches let's just
[3:11:54] go to first base
[3:11:56] drink some more water today
[3:11:59] i know that's deep and that's not out of
[3:12:01] the seventh seal page 847 but
[3:12:04] drink some more water
[3:12:07] i don't know where that comes from
[3:12:08] sometimes you know
[3:12:10] but it's time for some of you to leave
[3:12:15] it's time for some of you to know that
[3:12:17] your your calling and position in life
[3:12:20] cannot be the address of this wound
[3:12:22] healing center that's across the parking
[3:12:24] lot from olive garden
[3:12:27] that brother john looked across and saw
[3:12:29] this brother jason and i said
[3:12:31] immediately i thought about our young
[3:12:33] people and i thought if they can have a

[3:14:40] well what about my friends and what
[3:14:42] about this it won't even come in your
[3:14:43] mind if they're not a predestinated part
[3:14:46] of god's mind you won't even think about
[3:14:48] it oh brother john when we're gonna sit
[3:14:51] at the marriage supper and be crying and
[3:14:53] weeping it's because my friend didn't
[3:14:55] make it that's not tears

[3:15:00] my friend missed it
[3:15:03] it's gonna be tears of joy that you made
[3:15:06] it and that friend that person won't
[3:15:09] even come into your mind
[3:15:11] that trouble that you're dealing with
[3:15:13] today and your soul like this about and

[3:15:32] i don't know about scars jesus even when
[3:15:35] he was changed he showed thomas his
[3:15:38] scars
[3:15:39] so i don't understand all that and i
[3:15:41] don't need to know

[3:16:01] revelation myself
[3:16:04] unless i see the scars on his hand i'm
[3:16:07] not going to believe
[3:16:08] so jesus you know he's just like jesus

[3:18:26] brother
[3:18:27] [Applause]
[3:18:38] because as we go home this afternoon
[3:18:41] this is what satan wants to do to all of
[3:18:43] us
[3:18:44] he's trying to jump on us
[3:18:47] gang up on us
[3:18:50] and what they're doing is they'll bite
[3:18:52] the back flanks of the big animal
[3:18:55] it could weigh more than
[3:18:56] them but they if they can just get this
[3:18:58] animal bleeding
[3:19:01] that's why i circled that and they jump
[3:19:03] on the back of these and they'll jump on
[3:19:05] the back of elephants
[3:19:08] they're trying to get them unstable
[3:19:10] because if they can get this elephant
[3:19:13] on its side and start going for the
[3:19:15] juggler
[3:19:16] within moments it's gone
[3:19:19] huge animals huge
[3:19:21] and it'll go for the juggler
[3:19:23] and it'll just latch right on and
[3:19:25] they'll shake and shake and all they're
[3:19:26] doing is just shaking more
[3:19:30] and it's not long
[3:19:35] and on the bottom photo
[3:19:37] what this uh animal will do it'll run
[3:19:39] behind someone and then it'll flick out
[3:19:43] its paw like that while it's running and
[3:19:44] that animal will topple
[3:19:47] after running running running running
[3:19:49] satan's got you alone you're wounded
[3:19:51] you're out by yourself and then he
[3:19:52] starts running after you the devil's
[3:19:54] after and then he's go and he'll just
[3:19:59] and then before you know it you're
[3:20:00] tumbling tumbling your head is hitting
[3:20:02] your ears your your brain and then just
[3:20:04] tumbling tumbling and then that and
[3:20:06] it'll go over a latch a hold of
[3:20:08] your throat
[3:20:11] and gasping and gasping
[3:20:23] and spiritually that's what a lot of
[3:20:24] people become they've become a product
[3:20:27] of satan
[3:20:29] and they'll run around in the field and
[3:20:31] they he's got you he's got you he's
[3:20:33] coming after you you need some help
[3:20:39] and this is what's called the hamstrings
[3:20:41] on the back of you he'll get the
[3:20:43] hamstrings and brother branham said the
[3:20:45] hamstrings is your prayer life
[3:20:48] and he'll grab your hamstrings
[3:20:51] so then i got my arms i got my
[3:20:54] i i got my feet i'm so strong i'm so
[3:20:58] able to do things and satan's going for
[3:21:01] your hamstrings
[3:21:02] your prayer life
[3:21:06] and this is like a
[3:21:08] a night vision camera took these photos
[3:21:10] of
[3:21:11] this deer
[3:21:12] and the wolves and the coyotes they got
[3:21:14] them going in circles and they bite at
[3:21:17] their flanks and they bite it there
[3:21:19] because this is a sensitive part
[3:21:22] and they're biting
[3:21:24] at the hamstrings and they're biting
[3:21:25] that in that tail in the backside then
[3:21:28] they get so weak and they lose their
[3:21:30] blood they start losing the life
[3:21:32] and then they fall down and those wild
[3:21:35] dogs and coyotes and those just start
[3:21:38] pulling out they literally pull out the
[3:21:40] intros of the animal while it's still
[3:21:43] alive
[3:21:44] they say oh brother john change the
[3:21:46] picture that's what he's doing to young
[3:21:47] people
[3:21:48] he's literally pulling out the insides
[3:21:56] and they're living they're smiling give
