[Music] is [Music] everybody [Music] [Music] [Applause] and we thank the lord for his goodness to us all amen i'm going to continue on this subject knowing god and while you're standing we'll just do our opening scripture john chapter 4 and verse 22 through 24 ye worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall work worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeks such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth amen let's pray gracious heavenly father we're so thankful we ask that your spirit would just come now just give us rest in your presence lord pray i pray that you would take these words lord that it would be beyond words and that it would be spiritual revelation to the depths of our souls lord take it and make it alive to each one of us help us each to get ourselves out of the way the the cares of this world the frustrations of the day that may we lay him aside lord and just take a deep breath and focus our hearts upon you just for a few minutes here today lord help us give us strength give us the energy that we have need of the father we ask it in jesus christ's name amen god bless you you can be seated so of course this is jesus speaking to the samaritan woman and it's such an astounding verse there jesus comes and really messes up society and cultural norms and he comes and he sends his disciples away he went to some they were going to another place he needed to go to samaria before they went to that other place so we went way out of the way in order for to hit one rejected person and he he went there and he didn't mince words these were she was a samaritan her background was that they combined a little bit of worship of jehovah with a little bit of worship of pagan gods and so they knew about jacob they knew about the stories of the bible but they also had heathen superstition mixed in with their faith they knew about messiah coming as well even though they had various superstitions mixed in with that and he tells he tells he tells her straight you don't even you don't you're ignorant you don't even know who you're worshiping you and all your people are in ignorance he says we know what we worship salvation is from the jews we have the temple we have the law we have the promises etc but then he turns and give tells this is stunning because he didn't go and tell this to the public this is a samaritan woman and he tells her a secret something's changing something is going to be different the hour is coming and now is when the true worshipers they don't need to go to the temple they don't need to go to the synagogue they can worship him right here right in this place in spirit and in truth he says the father is seeking what was he doing with the samaritan woman the father was seeking her he was looking for her because god is spirit he's not limited to a building he's not limited to one space he'll meet you wherever the true sincere non-hypocritical heart will seek him and we must worship him in that spirit and in that truth and what we find today is a similar situation in america what is it what is it people don't know god they have a concept about god they have an idea about god today god is a grandfather god is oh it's okay i mean i don't like you to sin but it's okay if you do i just kind of wink at wink at your sinning just go on sinning because i'm so merciful that any sinner off the street is is saved it doesn't matter how much he drinks how much he smokes how much he curses god he has his funeral and now he's in heaven because he was baptized as an infant in the lutheran church or the catholic church or some nonsense and this is the god that's held over the people god is love god is mercy that's true that's absolute truth and we hang our souls on that but without presenting the other part of it that what is why does he need to be merciful god is just merciful and he just hands out mercy to everyone that's not how it works again we we spoke before we know god as he reveals himself in his word and also through the means which he has chosen to reveal himself through the ministry of the word that he's anointed and called and sent forth through his mess his chosen messengers he reveals himself that's what he's declared all through history we don't know him as our heart knows him our heart is deceitful we don't know him as popular culture declares him to be on the hallmark channel at christmas time we know god as he's revealed in his word and we don't just take the part of the word that we like that's easy easy to hear that's that tickles our senses if we do that we're not we don't know god we're not seeking god and what is what is what is it when we pervert the truth of god it becomes idolatry it's not just a little mistake it's not just well they're a little off on their theology but their heart is right um god is a god of his word god is just god will take vengeance on sin the the the bible says the wages of sin is death that's not a joke that's not hyperbole that's not a a punishment like parents will give out you you promise some huge terrible punishment to your child hoping to scare them out of that behavior so when you have to deal with giving them a spanking or whatever it is god is not doing that he is he says what he means and he means what he says and he is faithful to his word fulfill it when we sin we die the day you eat thereof that day you die brother branham in the token 1964 says god is a good god that is true but he is a god of anger too he's a god of judgment he's a god of wrath we fail to get that you make him so good till you make him some old dodie grandpa he's not no dodie grandfather he's almighty god and he don't have no grandchildren think about these things he brought his judgment upon all of creation all of creation was made subject to vanity when adam sinned and it was not for multiple sins it was for one sin for one sin he cursed canaan in all his generations for one sin moses was excluded from the promised land for one sin elisha's servant was struck with leprosy for one sin usia was struck with leprosy and lived with it the rest of his life for one sin ananias and sapphira were struck down dead god commands saul to utterly destroy all the men women children animals and all possessions of the amalekites and he does most of that but not all of it and because of it god removes the kingdom from saul removes the anointing removes all of that from him korah dathan and abyram rebelled against moses and god didn't just say you're going to die one day and be judged he literally opened up the earth and it swallowed and they went alive into hell this is the god that declares himself in the bible it might be hard to hear it might be difficult to hear but if we don't hear it we don't understand who god is we don't understand the gospel we don't understand his mercy we don't understand what we are saved from because what are we we're saved from something the wrath of god luke 13 1-5 that were present at that season some that told him of the galileans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices and jesus answered said unto them supposedly that these galileans were sinners above all the galileans because they suffered such things i tell you nay but except you repent ye shall all likewise perish for those eighteen upon whom the tower and siloam fell and slew them think he that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish he didn't mince any words he spoke it just as it is that's a fact they died a terrible death and because they died a terrible death everyone assumed these were sinners and this was god's wrath poured out on upon them and jesus is saying your thinking is false you deserve the same death you we all deserve the same death don't get it wrong not just them you and i deserve the same death don't don't don't misunderstand this applies to you and me this is what we're worthy of if you want to get what you deserve this is what you and i deserve god's wrath and judgment we all we all sin and we are not struck dead instantly are we the whole world does the same and because of this they begin to take for granted the fact that with one sin we deserve to be struck dead immediately we take one more breath by god's purpose by god's will by god's mercy anyone that's still alive on this earth today after they've sinned god's mercy is still there for them what what do most do they trample it under their feet they they despise it they say they don't want it because how do they say they don't want it of course everyone at the end of the road says they want the mercy of god but god has a he has an offer for mercy and he has a way to receive mercy and the world doesn't want it that way they want to live any way they want and then get god's mercy at the very end and it doesn't work that way again this concept that we all have especially an american mindset we all think that we deserve mercy i was a good enough person that i deserve mercy mercy is not something you deserve it is the opposite of what you deserve mercy is god saying i freely release you from the punishment that you so richly deserve deuteronomy 32 39 through 42 see now that i even i am he and there is no god with me i kill and i make alive i wound and i heal neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand for i lift up my hand to heaven and say i live forever if i wet my glittering sword and my hand take hold on judgment i will render vengeance to mine enemies and will reward them that hate me i will make mine arrows drunk with blood and my sword shall devour flesh and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy this is speaking of god's wrath and his wrath is eternal and his hatred of sin is eternal i should say let me put it this way god's wrath is his eternal hatred for sin his wrath only lasts for a moment i said i mis spoke said that wrong his wrath says his last only for a moment his wrath is not eternal but his hatred of sin is eternal his wrath is not a malignant or malicious anger poured out without consideration as though he's reacting to various outside forces that cause him personal damage we we sometimes get that misconception israel sins and moses moses is there and what he declares to moses my anger is burning against them i'm going to destroy them and so we get this picture that all of us god's just i'm so mad at you no that's not what's happening number one god is working in moses's life he's he is angry with them he's full he's full of anger his his anger was hot against them but it wasn't a reaction it was he saw them sin he knew that they were going to sin before the world was ever created but he saw them sin and he begins to act upon his wrath against their sin why because he wants moses to step in and request mercy why does he want moses to step in and request mercy because he's going to have a son that's born that will be the mediator and moses was a type of that so rather than it being god's just really mad and he's just oh i'm gonna beat you guys up no it's god purposed planned set things forward spoke to moses in such a way that would elicit moses to say lord take me don't take them why because he had it in his plan to put forth a type right there in the bible for us to see what the messiah would be all about and what kind of attitude that you and i should have towards sinners towards people around us god's wrath is his just equity or his just payment that he has towards sin and evil god is holy and so because god is holy he's morally perfect and his law the same he set forth the ten commandments and his expectation is that we keep them perfectly and when we don't we sin that's sin and when we sin when we go against god's moral perfections the result is his wrath when we sin we deserve death we deserve wrath that's what it's just the natural following one plus one equals two when you put forth an equation that's the depth of my equations i'm not up on algebra anymore or anything but some of you are good mathematicians and could write out a in-depth equations with a lot of steps but when you do this equation it always it always works out to this answer at the end the same thing is with god's god's uh god's word god's law because god is holy his law we break his law it equals this which is his punishment it always follows god is not wrathful because he's somehow choosing to be malignant it's a result of the actions of his creation god's anger is an attribute that is a result of his holy character meeting the with the evil character of his creation god's holiness activated against sin again we we go through these stories in the scripture the flood is a nice little story we have that we tell our children it's a bathtub like device that's filled with animals and it's just a really fun story about animals except that it's not and somehow the devil has inserted this into so many of children's books that it's a cute little story it's not a cute little story it should it should scare us to death this is god's wrath he literally destroys the whole everyone that's in existence and everything that's in existence on the planet up until that point with only a few that he saves to repopulate the earth billions of people perished in the flood amen why did they perish in the flood because god's holiness became active against wickedness we're living in an hour where his mercy is still extending his mercy is still there but there's coming a day when his fire it's not going to be water it's going to be fire that comes out and it's going to destroy just about everything romans 1 18 says this for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness god's wrath is revealed it's already revealed it's not in the future going to be it's already revealed and you can read that in in romans 1 18 through 32 verse 32 says who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them we've come to such an hour once again that wickedness is celebrated they have pleasure it's a good thing that which is evil is spoken of as a positive people are celebrated on the front of magazines as heroes for being perverts for for going against the will of god that's that's the state that we're in today and the wrath of god is already being revealed in fact in the fact that he's given them up to their lusts he said okay i was i was extending my mercy i was preventing you from doing these things but now i le i'll take my hand off you can do any i'll let you do any perversion that you want to do and they do and then what do they do they rejoice and they celebrate one another that's what this verse says that they do in all of this we have to be careful not to devise a picture of our god in our soul that's not based on scripture number one is people can take god being a wrathful god and totally use that in in a way to bring forth legalism to bring forth all kinds of manipulation control bad attitudes that's not what this is about this is about understanding who god is and the power of the gospel of jesus christ if we that's a perversion of understanding the wrath of god people will say that something bad happened to me because it was god was just angry at me and it's people say that i've i've heard it on the missions field i've heard even immature believers say that and it's completely perversion of understanding the wrath of god when you're when when you're a believer the wrath of god has been swallowed up in christ he's not pouring out his wrath on you if you experience something difficult in your life as a born-again spirit-filled person you're you're not experiencing the wrath of god you're you're experiencing his love in the form of what correction but not even that sometimes it's not even correction some sometimes it's simply you need this experience in your life to make you more like jesus christ has nothing to do with correction and it's simply that this is what you need to be more like him he was christ was perfected through the things the things that he suffered it wasn't correction it wasn't correction it was simply this is necessary for you to be in that state of maturity to go to gethsemane and calvary so don't get this misunderstood when we talk about the wrath of god rightly divide the word don't let the devil twist the scriptures the wrath of god is real the wrath of god is what we deserve but remember that was that's the blood of christ solves that completely we've passed for past from death unto life not because of anything that we've done but because of the blood of jesus christ and the gift that god gives to us which is faith faith in him alone so don't get it confused don't get it mixed up we must understand the wrath of god but we can't we rightly divide the word of truth the next one is it to me is so interesting the the one of his attributes speaking of the jealousy of god it's one we don't think about often but look at what he says about himself in exodus verse exodus 20 verse 5 he says thou shalt not bow thy self down thyself to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me so he says i'm a jealous god and then exodus 34 14. it says for thou shalt worship no other god for the lord whose name is jealous is a jealous god so here he's he says this is my name this is one of the why don't we have this as one of the compound names of jehovah in the old testament but he says my name is jealous in other words my character and my reputation is jealous because your name represents who you are right so here his name is jealous in our day and age jealousy is always associated with something negative right in our day and age jealous speaks of suspicious apprehensive of rivalship uneasy through fear that another has withdrawn or may withdraw from one the affections of a person he loves or enjoy some good which he desires to obtain etc so it's it's like a suspicion a suspicious type of thing and it's always negative and usually for us the characteristic of jealousy is it's a soul-robbing destructive character flaw that literally ruins everything in its path right but god not only says he's jealous but he again says his name is jealous so we need to be able to reconcile these two different things because we can't throw out the scripture because our culture says this thing is is not right and you'll even see people who are atheists railing against you know what kind of god says he's a jealous god this is just terrible but god delights in being jealous he's not ashamed he says it right there close to the ten commandments and then he repeats it again and says my name is jealous so he's not ashamed of it neither should we be ashamed of it god is a jealous god deuteronomy 4 24 says for the lord thy god is a consuming fire even a jealous god deuteronomy 6 15 says for the lord thy god is a jealous god among you lest the anger of the lord thy god be kindled against thee and destroy thee from off the face of the earth so let's consider jealousy in the context of scripture exodus 34 6-7 you know we can't any of these attributes like if you just focus on the wrath of god but never look at the mercy of god the love of god you'll have things out of order you always have to have these attributes in their full picture not just one part of it and so exodus 34 6 and 7 says and the lord passed by before him and proclaimed the lord the lord god merciful and gracious long-suffering and abundant in goodness and truth keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's trinity children under the third and fourth generation so god is merciful he's gracious long-suffering abundant and goodness abundant in truth forgiving iniquity transgression and sin punishing the guilty and he's also jealous so we can't we can't run away from it we can't say well let's let's dismiss that so that i guess the question comes down to this how can jealousy be a virtue in god when it is a moral vice in men so first of all the word jealousy used in the bible for god is really uh what we term as like an anthropomorphism in other words you're you're saying you're speaking about god in human terms that you and i can understand even though god really transcends these human terms that we're using in other words if we define if we if we take jealousy and define it the way our human understanding brings it then we'll be perverting god's word we need to define god's word based on god's word not based on what we think it might mean so the first thing is james 1 20 says for the wrath of man works not the righteousness of god but the wrath of god is the judicial outworking of god's righteousness so the wrath of man is does not accomplish god's rights our anger is not going to accomplish and set forth the righteousness of god it's only going to pervert it but the wrath of god actually establishes and goes out because of the righteous his righteousness so we have to look at this and see this that god's jealousy is actually a positive thing it's not a combination of anger and frustration envy and spite that's human jealousy god's jealousy is a praiseworthy zeal in fact if you look at one of the meetings in one of the translations of the word jealous it also speaks of zealous or zeal to burn hot so god's zeal or god's jealousy speaks of the preservation of something that is precious above all things number one and that's his glory his character so he's jealous because he wants to preserve the thing that is most precious in all the world it's him if we act that way we have a serious mental problem i think we have a president that kind of acts that way right now that everything is done for to preserve one's own standing character etc is bad for us for god to preserve himself and act to glorify himself is he's only doing the right thing that everyone should do so also there's two kinds of jealousy in humans really if you look at it closely there's a wicked jealousy which comes from a hatred for others a selfishness you want what someone has taken away from you or what you feel like it belongs to you but there is a godly jealousy that we would have for one another that a husband or a wife would have to their spouse i'm not talking about a spiteful jealousy i'm talking about the attitude that we have that we say my spouse is my spouse it's not your spouse don't touch my spouse don't touch my wife don't say bad things to my wife and i don't want my wife going with anybody else she doesn't want her husband going with somebody else that's that is a good form of jealousy now that can turn and be suspicion and anger and manipulation and control i'm not talking about that that's what we're talking about in the first time wicked jealousy that you want to control something because you're so scared of losing it so you'll you'll grab it and squeeze it to death and ruin it and ruin what you had in the process not talking about that i'm just talking about the basic agreement that a husband and wife have with each other we're exclusive and we watch and we're careful and we're we have a great amount of zeal to be sure that it stays that way in our relationships that's a good thing that's a godly thing and god's jealousy is the latter that what we're just talking about the second jealousy is a virtue and it shows a correct understanding of the marriage covenant and it's the same thing with god towards us he enters that covenant with us that marriage covenant with us and we belong to him he does not want us looking to another he doesn't want us to put anyone before him he says i'll have no other gods before me ezekiel 8 3 says and he put forth the form of a hand and took me by a lock of mine head and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven and brought me in the visions of god to jerusalem to do to the door of the inner gate that looks towards the north where was the seat of the image of jealousy which provokes to jealousy again these people are supposed to be worshipping god in the temple instead they they have idols up secretly worshiping and he calls it an image of jealousy that provokes to jealousy provokes who to jealousy him god so god's jealousy first starts with his love for his own glory and secondly for his love for us he seeks to preserve his love and he seeks to preserve his bride for himself and he goes to every length to be able to do that we understand though his love is elective it's not an emotion he's chosen us by his sovereign grace and because of that he's jealous over us not only that but it's god's jealousy is to fulfill his purpose to fulfill his righteousness and judgment isaiah 9 7 says of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever what does he say the zeal it's the same word the zeal or the jealousy of the lord of hosts will perform it ezekiel 5 13 says thus shall my anger be accomplished and i will cause my fury to rest upon them and i will be comforted and they shall know that i the lord have spoken it in my zeal when i have accomplished mine fury in them so god god has a zeal has a jealousy to accomplish his purpose in us and in the world in the world it speaks of a a red hot fervor well he wants us to have the same attitude towards him he's our husband right so we he wants us not to be lukewarm he doesn't want us to be cold he wants us to be on fire hot full of zeal for him i don't have it down here but there's a there's i believe it was elijah the lord asked where are you going elijah he said i've been very jealous for the lord my god and that should be our attitude we should be jealous for the same things he is jealous over we should have the same red hot zeal for his glory for his work to go forward for his purpose to be accomplished in the earth and it should move us to act to speak to pray to do something not just to sit but it should move us elijah wasn't just sitting someplace off in the distance he was praying he was seeking god and god moved him to do something and so as he's moving after this great great mighty work for god god asked him where are you going i've been very jealous with the lord god i love that isaiah 42 verse 8 says i am the lord that is my name and my glory will i not give to another neither my praise to great graven images and then isaiah 48 11 says for my own sake even for my known sake will i do it for how should my name be polluted and i will not give my glory unto another that's the basis of god's jealousy he wants to see his name first his name glorified he be the first one in our hearts and in our minds and he works continuously to make sure that is the case let's look a little bit at the couple different things they kind of blend together the supremacy of god and then the sovereignty of god we'll see if we get to the sovereignty of god but so the supremacy of god supremacy means the state or condition of being superior to all others in authority power or status first chronicles 29 verses 11 and 12. thine o lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine thine is the kingdom o lord and thou art exalted as head above all both riches and honor come of thee and thou rainest over all and in thine hand is power and might and in thine hand it is to make great and to give strength unto all god reigns overall now not in the future in the millennium he reigns over everything now whatever he desires to accomplish that's what he accomplishes because he's the supreme being he makes some rich he makes some poor he puts some in power he gives some to no power makes some strong he makes some weak second chronicles 20 verse 6 says and and said oh lord god of our fathers art not thou god in heaven and rule us not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee do you have troubles in your life do you have difficulties this is a great verse to speak over it because god is in control of everything and sometimes we just need to speak it over ourself to remember that god is in control of our circumstances nothing's happening out of chance this isn't some random act some random thing that's happened god is working mightily in your situation in what's going on with you job 42 verse 2 i know that thou canst do everything and that no thought can be withholding from thee you can do everything or in other words the way to say is you can do anything god can do anything that he pleases there's no one to stop him there's nothing that can prevent him jeremiah 32 17 says ah lord god behold thou has made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm and there's nothing too hard for thee proverbs 21 verse 1 the king's heart is in the hand of the lord as the rivers of water he turns it whithersoever he will i just want to comfort you for a minute right here we look at what's going on today i i've just been ignoring politics i've been ignoring as best as i can election disputes and speeches of this one and that one because it just drags your heart to the wrong place time and i'm not saying stick your head in the sand not saying that at all but when you do update yourself be sure that you have the scripture right here written somewhere on your device or in front of you if joe biden as president we're not all going to die if joe biden is president god still provides for your needs it has nothing to do with trump trump didn't provide for your needs and neither will joe biden provide for your needs god will provide for your needs would i rather have trump as president yes does it make a difference to me as a christian not really and if it does god come please come to the altar and repent and let me repent because the reality is this is not this is not where our ultimate citizenship is yes we live here yes if you feel led to you should vote yes you should be a responsible person yes you should help in every way you can in this society and the people around you but remember that's not what you're called to do that's not your primary position in this world not even your job as your primary position your primary position is to be an ambassador for jesus christ and your god provides for you if we turn into a communist dictatorship overnight god will provide for you and our church will be a lot better for it i think because we will suffer and we'll actually share our faith and will actually begin to grow by leaps and bounds because of the suffering so i don't believe that's what's going to happen i'm just saying what if the worst thing that we as americans could think of happened what if and i say so what god has decreed that that happened what should my attitude be well we're americans we should have the second amendment and we should have this yeah we do we have those things and we thank the lord for that but nevertheless who is the one the kings the presidents the scotus the speaker of the house's heart is in the hand of the lord as the rivers of water he turns it however he wants to so don't fear because the one who loves you controls the hearts of the evil people of this world and he will provide for you if you're obedient to him if you follow his scriptural principles you will have food you'll have clothes and he'll take care of you so there's nothing to be afraid of there's nothing to get so worked up about okay i get worked up too right i'm not saying i don't i'm saying don't do that our eyes are getting my eyes your eyes they get on the wrong thing and it becomes a hindrance to the practice of your faith oh no it isn't yes it is because you're supposed to make a difference you're not supposed to wait for the president or the supreme court to make a difference in this world you're supposed to make a difference in people's lives right here the little things the small things around you the little things that you only can do to serve to help to show the love of christ to others that's what you're supposed to do you're not going to change who's president amen god has decreed that he is going to put that person in there i'm not saying you shouldn't vote but i'm saying you by taking thought by worrying are not going to change anything keep your eyes on things above not on things on the earth romans 11 36 for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen god is supreme all through history we do read about people that defy god even scripture says so and so defined god and we see it today in the world they're defying god but what they're doing is they're actually defying the external word of god they're not defying the sovereign decree or plan of god their very defiance is a fulfillment of that plan romans 9 22 says what if god willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long-suffering patience the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction and jude 1 4 says for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god in our lord jesus christ they were ordained before the world began to be people who are in defiance of the word of god god has a purpose in all that don't get worried about it don't get upset pray pray for them but ultimately we know the people that continue to resist and defy god's word will experience god's wrath but even jesus on the cross prayed for those who continually defied god and crucified him he still prayed for them i won't get through it all but i'm gonna gonna just start to speak on the sovereignty of god the sovereignty of god is the exercise of his supremacy so we read scriptures like this over and over again psalm 135 verse 6 says whatsoever the lord pleased that did he in heaven and in the earth and in the seas and in the deep places so god does what he pleases nothing can stop him from doing that i'm just going to skip some parts here just to look at the outworking of god's sovereignty proverbs 16 33. it says the lot is cast into the lap so that i'm going to re read from the esv the lot is cast into the lap but it's every decision is from the lord put it into modern terms dice are rolled but whatever they come up with it's from the lord so god is sovereign over every bit every small thing every small decision they used to cast lots in order to make decisions or say this is the right thing to do and this is the right day to do it on in other words god's saying it's from him god is sovereign over nature you know in jonah what did he do commanded the fish to swallow him he commanded a plant to grow and then he commanded a worm to destroy the plant that he commanded to grow so god is sovereign over worms god is sovereign over plants i tend to kill him too often he's sovereign over that he didn't give me that gift i'm trying to learn but i'm not gifted that way god is sovereign over the supernatural realm satan came before job or came before god regarding job and he was only given certain permissions he could only go so far exodus 4 11 and the lord said unto him who hath made man's mouth or who makes the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not i the lord this is a little tricky place but put it into our terms god is sovereign over who is born with disabilities who has disabilities and so maybe that sounds bad but i want to i want to bring it on the other hand is that if you're born with a disability god has purpose in it and through it and he will use it for his sovereign purposes in the lives of your family in the lives of others god knows what he's doing and he's not doing it out of anger or malice he's doing it out of love so those who have disabilities it's not outside of god's control god has a purpose in it because he says i'm the one that make them first peter 4 19 wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as unto a faithful creator god is sovereign over our suffering again these things should bring comfort if you know god if you don't know god i doubt they'll bring comfort but if you know god it shouldn't say oh my goodness what is he talking about doesn't he know how much i hurt god loves you you know that you know him personally you know how he's led your life you know how he's been with you so if you're suffering you can rest in his sovereign hand amos 3 6 and i'm going to read from the esv to give a little bit deeper sense in this is a trumpet blown in a city and the people are not afraid does disaster come to a city unless the lord has done it god is sovereign over natural disasters and he has a purpose in them and he has a purpose to accomplish in them if he wants if he if he wants to he can quickly push a storm away make it disappear completely even from the radar everywhere but if he doesn't want that to happen he has another purpose he'll do that as well deuteronomy 32 verse 2 39 see now that i even i am he and there is no god with me i kill and i make alive i wound and i heal neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand the grim reaper is not in control of of death god is in control of both life and death every breath that we take every time our heart beats god ordained how many that we have before the foundation of the world james 4 13-15 go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we will go to such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow for what is your life it is even a vapor that appears for a little time then and then vanishes away for that you ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do this or that god is sovereign over our financial situation amen the success or failure of our work or business ventures god is sovereign over that and he will accomplish his purpose for his glory whether that's failure he'll use that to help you to grow to help you to rely on him more whatever his purpose is through that or to direct you somewhere else that's okay we just say thank you lord and keep moving on matthew 10 29 are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father even of the smallest most insignificant animals god knows about their death and god took and put forth a plan regarding their life and their death it's just astounding to think you know you see the swarms of animals and birds and every single one of them god knows that bird more completely than any scientist could possibly know them and he not only knows that but he knows the individual traits of that bird and it's it's the same and yet it's different from all the birds that are just like it it's astounding to think about musicians if you come first timothy 5 21 i charge thee before god and the lord jesus christ and the elect angels god is even sovereign over who are the angels that fall and who are the angels that didn't fall completely sovereign over them and a verse that i can usually not really read without crying so i'm going to try for the first time to read it without crying but joseph and the circumstances of his life and he comes there his father has passed away and his brothers are afraid that joseph is now going to declare his true colors and kill them all torture them all just like they did to him and he comes to them and he says but as for you you thought evil against me just think about that think about the things that have happened think about the crooked schemes the devil has tried to play on you has played on you the suffering that you've gone through the things that people have done against you spoken against you says you thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this i didn't make it to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive we look at things and we see things from the exterior and say joseph suffered a lot he was in a position to be a wealthy man in a wonderful uh a wonderfully wealthy family he was going to take over all of that and he had a life of comfort and ease just commanding people what to do and it was easy but god didn't want it easy for joseph he didn't ordain it to be easy for joseph and he it was god that allowed those men to do that to their brother it's terrible to think about what they did but god allowed it god had his hand over every situation they weren't going to kill him they had no there was no chance that they were going to kill him because god saw joseph basically on the throne in egypt in charge of everything they're administering by the wisdom of god and saving people alive in order for what god is moving the puzzle pieces everywhere in order that the children of israel would be in egypt so that god could manifest himself in such a incredible way by bringing them out by bringing egypt to its knees by crossing the red sea all of this good amazing good that happened everything really everything that followed in the plan of god really came down to this was joseph was thrown into a pit and he thought he was going to die save me save me somebody said oh let's sell them they sell them not knowing this set what it set forth something so marvelous so incredible stories uh that constantly daily touch people's lives and help them to walk more in faith and trust they thought it you thought evil against me but god meant it for good amen let's pray heavenly father we love you so much and it's so astounding to think lord this exercise of your sovereignty in the world and in our lives lord we let us just rest in that what's happening today is not out of your control it's not without purpose it might be upsetting our our minds and frustrating our plans and our our purposes but it's not frustrating you and it's not frustrating your purpose in our lives many things many things have been changed been blocked and and things that were normal for me i can't do anymore but you knew that lord and you purpose that all of these things that we see in our lives it's the working of your sovereignty and though some things are very difficult and very problematic and and bring suffering in our lives and yet you're working for good not only for our good but for the good within your entire plan of salvation we're coming to the very fruition of your plan of salvation and redemption and here we find ourselves in the midst of lockdowns and shutdowns and inability to travel internationally and all these things it's part of your plan lord we know that help us to see truly the place that you have us to be and help us to be all that we can be in christ just like what joseph was every situation he had success because he was walking in obedience walking with you lord let us continue to walk let us have lord a genuine red hot zeal as elijah i've been very jealous for the lord god of hosts can that be said about us can that be said about me lord let's just let's just take this time help us lord to just search our hearts just as you are jealous over us lord would you cause us to be jealous over you we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen
