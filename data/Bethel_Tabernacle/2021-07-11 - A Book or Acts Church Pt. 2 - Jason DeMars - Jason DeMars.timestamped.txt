[4:24] good morning everyone god bless you
[4:27] let's stand and pray
[4:32] gracious father we come to you now lord
[4:34] and we ask that your presence would be
[4:35] with us
[4:36] throughout the day today lord that you
[4:38] would anoint us with your holy spirit
[4:41] lord give us ears to hear lord help us
[4:45] all to get ourselves out of the way lord
[4:46] that your spirit would flow
[4:49] through us that you would be glorified
[4:50] that people would be healed
[4:52] touched delivered in every way
[4:55] they have need of father we ask these
[4:58] things in the name of the lord jesus
[4:59] christ
[5:00] amen all right i'm going to start on
[5:04] a book of acts church part two
[5:07] and we're looking at mark 13 verse 10
[5:13] to start with what is our commission
[5:17] what was their commission in the book of
[5:18] acts
[5:20] and the god and the gospel must first be
[5:23] published
[5:25] among all nations all right then
[5:29] matthew 24 verse
[5:32] 14 and this gospel of the kingdom
[5:36] shall be preached in all the world for a
[5:38] witness
[5:40] unto all nations and then shall the end
[5:44] come amen may the lord add the blessing
[5:46] to the reading of the word
[5:47] can be seated we talk about
[5:51] there's going to be another book of acts
[5:53] if if that
[5:54] original branch ever puts forth
[5:58] another branch which will produce fruit
[6:01] it will write another book of acts
[6:03] behind it
[6:04] and i think and maybe maybe it's just me
[6:07] but often i think oh
[6:09] uh the miracle isn't supernatural that's
[6:11] what's being referenced but
[6:13] that's not that's only a part of it
[6:16] right that's not the whole picture
[6:19] that's that's
[6:20] that's only a small portion
[6:24] of it the purpose of the miracles is not
[6:26] just to say hey
[6:27] we're we're a pentecostal church the
[6:30] pentecostal
[6:30] denomination has miracles the
[6:33] charismatic
[6:34] denomination has miracles it's not just
[6:37] that
[6:38] it's the nature behind that it's the
[6:40] purpose behind that
[6:41] brother branham says the pentecostal
[6:43] church cannot
[6:45] accomplish the great commission in the
[6:48] condition that it is
[6:49] today right the pentecostal denomination
[6:53] so in other words there's a great
[6:55] commission to be
[6:56] accomplished and there has to be a
[6:59] church that's in
[7:00] condition to accomplish it and so we
[7:03] have to be
[7:05] in that same condition and have that
[7:07] same heart
[7:08] it's not merely miracles and
[7:10] supernatural
[7:11] and healing services that's not what the
[7:13] book of acts is about the book of acts
[7:15] is about
[7:16] jesus christ being proclaimed among the
[7:19] nations
[7:20] and because he's being proclaimed among
[7:22] the nations because he's supernatural
[7:24] the supernatural
[7:25] follows but what if the church
[7:28] settles in and gets confused and says
[7:31] another book of acts is just miracles
[7:36] are they another book of acts there's
[7:38] another pentecost
[7:40] and so that's the danger is you're
[7:44] you're looking at the gifts instead of
[7:47] the what the giver has asked us to do
[7:50] and focusing on what the giver would
[7:52] have us to do
[7:53] now we all have a different calling
[7:57] we all have a different purpose so just
[8:00] like when we preach
[8:01] to a specific sin
[8:05] might not be talking about you but this
[8:08] might be talking to someone
[8:10] right there might be someone who the
[8:12] lord is working
[8:13] a commission in their lives maybe
[8:15] they're resisting maybe they're not
[8:16] hearing
[8:17] and they need to go forth nevertheless
[8:21] in the small scale and in the big scale
[8:23] of missions
[8:24] all of us need to have the heart
[8:28] what was that what what did brother
[8:29] branham say one of what if we took one
[8:31] of the
[8:32] one of the evidences of the holy ghost
[8:34] what did he say it was
[8:36] the people sighing and crying for the
[8:38] abominations
[8:39] done in the city and what did he put
[8:42] that onto
[8:43] a burden for lost souls there should be
[8:46] a burden
[8:47] in each of us for lost souls not just to
[8:50] have
[8:51] good youth programs and good youth camps
[8:54] and
[8:54] it's it that's good that's just the mc
[8:57] that's that's the
[8:58] mechanics what behind it needs to be a
[9:02] heart
[9:03] to see people saved and delivered and
[9:07] set free
[9:08] if we get our focus on the mechanics
[9:10] what is it it's just
[9:11] it's another program and brother branham
[9:13] continually
[9:15] condemned looking at it like that we
[9:17] have a program we had this many come in
[9:19] we have this
[9:19] so what what if you just are sent one to
[9:23] one place and it's just for one person
[9:25] are you disappointed or you say thank
[9:27] you lord that i accomplished the purpose
[9:29] you sent me for
[9:32] it might just be for one soul you you
[9:35] might labor
[9:36] and work and sacrifice everything and
[9:38] there's just one person
[9:41] that you've won to christ but your heart
[9:43] through all of that
[9:45] was to see souls transformed
[9:50] when jesus christ is proclaimed in truth
[9:53] the supernatural follows
[9:55] but don't get it out of order don't be
[9:57] so focused and say
[9:58] well we have to have the supernatural
[10:00] that you become
[10:01] pentecostal denomination nothing
[10:04] we want we we know that miracles follow
[10:07] goodness
[10:08] i that testimony the service we had on
[10:11] wednesday night i i thought why is
[10:14] everyone just
[10:15] staring forward we should be hanging
[10:17] from the
[10:18] from the ceiling the miracles that god
[10:21] did
[10:22] and my goodness some of the miracles
[10:25] that were done is just
[10:26] it's like astounding
[10:29] why what is that why why are there
[10:32] miracles why is there supernatural
[10:33] because
[10:34] we're following the word signs follow
[10:38] the word but don't get your focus on the
[10:40] signs that you missed the word
[10:43] the purpose for it all is proclaiming
[10:46] jesus christ
[10:49] all right scriptural signs of the times
[10:53] in 1964
[10:55] brother branham says we all claim to be
[10:57] in christ
[10:58] but when we come in there with the
[11:00] denominational creed we live by it
[11:02] that's right
[11:03] but if that tree ever brings forth
[11:05] another branch it'll be another book of
[11:07] acts wrote behind it it'll be like the
[11:08] first branch was that
[11:09] that come forth it'll be holy ghost
[11:11] filled holy ghost inspired holy ghost
[11:14] there'll be no creed to it it'll be a
[11:16] word
[11:20] so book of acts church they gave up
[11:24] everything to follow christ
[11:29] they built their lives around the word
[11:31] and prayer
[11:33] they anticipated and expected to be
[11:37] applauded lauded as heroes
[11:42] no in fact they were told specifically
[11:46] by jesus you'll be hated you'll be
[11:49] persecuted
[11:50] you'll be spoken against in other words
[11:52] made fun of
[11:53] and to top it all off the cherry on the
[11:56] top is you'll be killed
[11:59] okay when they were told to stop
[12:02] preaching about jesus
[12:05] did they run and hide at a corner
[12:08] they said well should we obey god or
[12:11] should we obey men
[12:13] they continued preaching about jesus
[12:17] they labored and were sent to reach
[12:20] every nation
[12:23] now don't get this wrong but they didn't
[12:27] spend their all
[12:28] so that they could go to a special
[12:29] meeting
[12:32] and be made to feel good no
[12:35] or get patted on the back again i'm not
[12:37] speaking against special meetings
[12:39] i'm not speaking against camps but what
[12:42] do we spend our all on what do we give
[12:44] our all on
[12:47] they didn't do that in the book of acts
[12:50] they spent their all for what
[12:52] nations and people that hated and
[12:56] despised them
[12:58] that didn't want them there
[13:01] that fought against them why because
[13:03] there was a predestinated seed
[13:06] amongst those nations that needed to
[13:08] hear the gospel
[13:09] and they were willing to give their all
[13:11] for that
[13:14] they turned the world upside down right
[13:18] they died as martyrs almost 100 of them
[13:23] amen hallelujah another book of acts
[13:33] another book of acts it's only miracles
[13:37] right we only want miracles we're in
[13:38] america we're soft
[13:40] we're sissified just give me miracles
[13:43] that's what the book of acts is
[13:45] you're you've never read the book of
[13:46] acts apparently
[13:50] greater than solomon is here in 1963
[13:52] brother branham says the church needs
[13:54] tonight
[13:56] not a soft hybrid something soft and
[13:58] flabby like the church is
[14:01] a confession be baptized and you're
[14:03] christian to be a christian is
[14:05] self-denial denial
[14:06] deny yourself take up your cross and
[14:08] follow me daily
[14:10] today it's so soft and people call
[14:12] themselves christians
[14:14] when it used to mean death to confess
[14:16] christ and you had to depend on him
[14:18] daily for everything you had
[14:20] need of
[14:27] god is identified by his characteristics
[14:29] in 1964.
[14:32] today we got hotbed plants called
[14:34] christians
[14:36] somebody you have to spray and baby and
[14:38] humor oh
[14:39] and will you give me fellowship will you
[14:40] cooperate will you do this
[14:43] oh you bunch of hot bed plants
[14:46] we need some genuine christianity born
[14:48] of the spirit of god
[14:50] and that will take no cooperation no
[14:52] nothing else they don't want nothing
[14:55] listen to that they don't want nothing
[14:58] what do they want
[15:00] christ they don't need a promise
[15:03] they don't need someone to pat him on
[15:05] the back they don't need someone say oh
[15:07] oh we'll give you a position we know
[15:08] you've we're sad you have
[15:10] you're upset we have to give you this
[15:12] and pat you on the back
[15:14] no no that's sissified christianity
[15:19] we toughen up we're not called to be
[15:22] hybrid plants
[15:24] we're called to be able to grow in the
[15:26] hot
[15:28] sun with the heat
[15:31] of difficulties and trials beating down
[15:33] on us
[15:34] and that should actually make us thrive
[15:37] should strengthen us
[15:38] not weaken us and desire for
[15:42] oh someone come pat me on the back we
[15:45] don't need
[15:46] a human being to approve us
[15:49] we are looking for one person to say
[15:54] well done
[15:56] we i love you all i know you love me
[15:59] i hope maybe not after this but
[16:05] it doesn't no regardless regardless i
[16:07] want to please christ
[16:10] i want to live for christ and whether
[16:12] anybody
[16:13] recognizes or disrespects or throws
[16:16] tomatoes at me
[16:18] i want to serve christ i want to be
[16:21] faithful to him
[16:22] not worrying about oh my feelings are
[16:24] hurt
[16:25] which part of the book of acts was that
[16:27] in my feelings are hurt
[16:33] and yet feelings get hurt and now what
[16:38] now what are we hotbed somebody come and
[16:41] spray that one you got to spray them no
[16:44] let's be rugged let's be strong let's be
[16:48] tough
[16:49] brother branham says in another quote
[16:52] let's take the word
[16:55] just as it is preach it lay it out and
[16:57] he says real christians
[16:59] love it they're not offended by the word
[17:03] being preached
[17:04] in its fullness they love it because why
[17:08] it makes me right with him that's what i
[17:10] want that's what i may
[17:11] oh aim my whole purpose is
[17:16] john 12 24 and 25 verily verily i say
[17:19] unto you except the corn of wheat
[17:21] fall into the ground and die it abideth
[17:23] alone but if it die it brings forth much
[17:25] fruit
[17:26] he that loves his life shall lose it and
[17:29] he that hates his life in this world
[17:31] shall
[17:32] keep it unto life eternal
[17:37] brother branham quotes this verse and he
[17:39] says and the people
[17:40] in the sermon why in 1962 and the people
[17:42] don't want to die
[17:44] you want to be alive in the world and
[17:47] still you want to be religious so you
[17:49] accept
[17:50] an intel intellectual conception of it
[17:52] and then when you do that you're still
[17:54] dead
[17:55] in sin and trespasses don't listen to
[17:57] that and say that's in denominations
[18:00] the message the messages coming to us
[18:05] and these things are coming to us people
[18:07] will take an intellectual conception
[18:10] in this message and they
[18:14] they don't want to be confronted they
[18:16] don't want to die to themselves
[18:18] they want to be they want to have a form
[18:22] of truth a form of truth
[18:27] and yet be a little bit like the world
[18:31] but not like christ
[18:35] or the conception or maybe it would be
[18:37] more this way
[18:39] our conception of christ is this
[18:42] but the reality is christ is here
[18:45] knocking at the door of your heart
[18:48] speaking forth his word
[18:49] it's not about our conceptions of who
[18:51] christ is
[18:53] how accepting he is how open he is yes
[18:56] he is and yet when he was accepting an
[19:00] open of those who were
[19:02] broken sinful destroyed
[19:05] what did he tell them go and sin some
[19:08] more
[19:10] go and sin no more it was it was about
[19:14] meeting that soul and bringing them to
[19:16] repentance
[19:17] not just meeting that soul and bringing
[19:19] them in and loading up the church
[19:22] there needs to be repentance
[19:26] what happened to the church
[19:30] are we waiting for the lost and dying to
[19:33] come to us
[19:36] are we hoping that people are that are
[19:38] opposing the message
[19:40] they'll just stop opposing the message
[19:44] or are we willing to take our stand are
[19:47] willing to stand up for truth and
[19:50] preach the truth no matter what
[19:53] opposition comes
[19:57] i want to speak about some
[20:00] men of god a few men of god through
[20:02] history that
[20:05] uh had did an incredible did incredible
[20:08] things for the gospel
[20:11] william booth of the salvation army we
[20:13] know the salvation army today and that's
[20:14] the place where we drop off our clothes
[20:16] right
[20:16] that's not what the original salvation
[20:20] army was and where it was
[20:21] if you if you get a little bit
[20:23] background of this it's just
[20:25] incredible the heart that william booth
[20:27] had
[20:28] and i want that same kind of heart
[20:31] one memorable day in july 1865 after
[20:35] exploring the streets in an east end
[20:37] district
[20:38] so how many are familiar with 1800s
[20:41] london east end you've never been there
[20:44] so
[20:45] i'll tell you neither have i i guess
[20:48] uh not that old kids josh you're
[20:51] thinking that
[20:55] um 1865 east end of london was this
[20:58] absolute slum it was filthy
[21:02] dirty full of drunks society was broken
[21:05] children running around without parents
[21:07] living on the streets
[21:09] just absolutely beyond beyond
[21:13] awful beyond terrible
[21:17] so one memorable day in july 1865 after
[21:20] exploring the streets
[21:22] in an east end district where he was to
[21:24] conduct a mission
[21:25] the terrible poverty vice and
[21:27] degradation of these needy people struck
[21:29] home to his heart
[21:31] he arrived at his hammersmith home just
[21:34] before midnight and greeting his waiting
[21:35] catherine with these words darling
[21:37] i have found my destiny can you imagine
[21:42] he went to the place that no one wants
[21:45] to go
[21:46] and he comes home yes
[21:50] yes i found my destiny now
[21:54] that is christ in a man
[21:58] she understood him together they
[22:00] administered god's grace to god's poor
[22:02] in many places now they were to spend
[22:04] their lives bringing deliverance
[22:06] to satan's captive captives in the evil
[22:09] jungle of london slums
[22:13] one of his he had a one of his sons was
[22:16] named bramwell
[22:18] so one day william booth took bramwell
[22:20] his son into an east end pub
[22:22] okay just imagine imagine that for a
[22:25] second picture
[22:27] in 1800s east end slum how
[22:30] how bad it smells
[22:34] the the filthy talking that's going on
[22:38] the drunkenness the sin that's taking
[22:40] place
[22:42] in this pub so he
[22:45] takes his son into an east end pub which
[22:47] was crammed full of dirty
[22:49] intoxicated creatures seeing the
[22:52] appalled look
[22:53] on his son's face he said gently
[22:56] bramwell
[22:57] these are our people the people i want
[23:01] you to live for
[23:03] isn't that amazing what a beautiful
[23:06] thing these are the people
[23:08] i want you to live and suffer
[23:11] and bring out of captivity to satan
[23:15] that's the heart of christ
[23:19] how many have ever heard of ct stud
[23:23] that's a pretty awesome name though
[23:24] isn't it
[23:26] he's a pretty awesome guy ct stud
[23:30] was like at the time maybe would say
[23:34] like
[23:35] kevin durant or or
[23:38] aaron rodgers he was a superstar
[23:42] in cricket very important sport in
[23:45] england at the time
[23:47] everyone loved and lauded ct stud
[23:51] his father was an extremely wealthy man
[23:56] multi-multi-multi-multi-millionaire in
[23:57] today's money
[23:59] and when
[24:02] the lord called him
[24:06] he inherited all that money and he
[24:08] already had a calling to be a missionary
[24:11] wouldn't you think oh my goodness how
[24:13] wonderful
[24:14] now all my missions work will be taken
[24:16] care of from now on
[24:18] do you know what ct stud did with all
[24:20] those
[24:22] multi-millions of dollars he gave every
[24:24] single dime
[24:26] to dl moody
[24:29] every single dime to him
[24:33] and he went to the missions field
[24:34] penniless
[24:36] trusting god and so he
[24:40] he had a ministry and he in
[24:43] in china in india
[24:46] in africa and
[24:49] he was working to raise up
[24:53] other missionaries and stand with them
[24:55] and help them get get started
[24:58] as missionaries in these far-off places
[25:01] and so he wrote a little pamphlet called
[25:04] christ's etc
[25:06] in other words christ's nobodies
[25:09] christ's
[25:10] the castaways of the world people that
[25:13] no one cares about no one's concerned
[25:15] about
[25:15] and he was saying this is what i am
[25:18] christ's etc
[25:20] i'm not important i'm not nobody i'm not
[25:22] trying to be anybody
[25:24] i just want to see souls saved
[25:27] and heathens have a chance to hear the
[25:29] gospel
[25:31] so he he writes in his little pamphlet
[25:34] can it be the years of christ's soldiers
[25:36] are deaf to the call of god and the
[25:39] cries of the dying souls of men
[25:42] king nicholas declared to his wartime
[25:44] rivals that his montenegrins would
[25:46] henceforth spill their blood for
[25:48] their persecuted compatriots when shall
[25:51] god be able to say have you seen my
[25:52] christians of today
[25:54] no longer they seek for gold or pleasure
[25:56] for honors or ease from henceforth my
[25:59] christians will spill their blood
[26:01] for the love and cause of my beloved son
[26:03] and the salvation of the neediest of men
[26:06] yes when when indeed shall we see a real
[26:10] church militant here upon the earth
[26:14] he says we should go crusading for
[26:16] christ we have the men the means and the
[26:18] ways
[26:19] the doors of the world have been opened
[26:21] wide for us by our god so believing that
[26:23] further delay
[26:24] would be sinful some of god's
[26:26] insignificants and nobodies in
[26:28] particular but trusting in our
[26:29] omnipotent god
[26:31] have decided on certain simple lines
[26:33] according to the book of god to make a
[26:35] definite attempt
[26:36] to render the evangelization of the
[26:38] world and accomplish fact
[26:40] for this purpose we have banded together
[26:42] under the name of christ etc
[26:45] and invite others of god's people to
[26:47] join us in this glorious enterprise
[26:50] we are merely christ's nobodies
[26:52] otherwise christ etc as we rejoice in
[26:55] and thank god for the good work being
[26:57] carried on in the already occupied lands
[26:59] by god's regular forces
[27:01] we seek to attack and win to christ only
[27:04] those parts of the devil's empire
[27:06] which are beyond the extremist outposts
[27:09] of the regular army of god
[27:11] oh i love that our method is to search
[27:15] and to find out what parts of the world
[27:17] at present remain unevangelized and then
[27:19] by faith in christ by prayer to god
[27:21] by obedience to the holy spirit by
[27:23] courage determination and supreme
[27:25] sacrifice to accomplish their
[27:27] evangelization
[27:28] with the us most dispatch
[27:32] paul writes romans 15 20 and 21 yea
[27:36] so have i strived to preach the gospel
[27:38] not where christ was named lest i should
[27:40] build upon another man's foundation
[27:42] but as it is written to whom he was not
[27:44] spoken of they shall see
[27:46] and they that have not heard shall
[27:48] understand
[27:52] and you shall be mark 13 13 you should
[27:54] be hated of all men for my name's sake
[27:57] but he that shall endure to the end the
[28:00] same shall be saved
[28:02] paul says for me to live is christ and
[28:05] what
[28:07] to die is gain
[28:12] second corinthians 5 8 he says we are
[28:14] confident i say and willing rather
[28:16] to be absent from the body and to be
[28:19] present
[28:20] with the lord that's a different
[28:23] world focus isn't it i'm ready
[28:27] to go out of this body i don't count it
[28:30] as a sacrifice i counted it to something
[28:32] that's a gain
[28:36] he also says in first corinthians 6 20
[28:38] for you are bought with the price
[28:41] therefore glorify god in your body and
[28:44] in your spirit which are gods
[28:47] romans 14 8 for whether we live we live
[28:50] unto the lord and whether we die
[28:51] we die unto the lord whether we live
[28:54] therefore or die
[28:55] we are the lords it seems in a way
[28:58] isn't that a little bit of cavalier
[29:00] statement towards life and death
[29:04] seems like it but the reality is he
[29:07] wasn't living
[29:08] for this space of time he was living to
[29:10] glorify christ no matter what the cost
[29:13] might be knowing that there was a
[29:16] greater reward for him if he dies
[29:19] in service to the king
[29:23] do we have this heart are we ready to
[29:27] live
[29:27] and die in service to christ
[29:32] that was the heart of the book of acts
[29:35] church
[29:36] that was what behind the preaching of
[29:38] the gospel
[29:40] and the supernatural that took place it
[29:42] was this kind of heart
[29:45] is it ours
[29:50] be not afraid brother branham says god
[29:52] goes to the gutters
[29:53] let's stand god
[29:56] goes to the gutters goes out into go out
[30:00] into the streets and highways and compel
[30:02] them to come in
[30:04] and remember that was the last call
[30:08] the church has gone off without him see
[30:11] you've gone off on tantrums let's not go
[30:14] off on tantrums
[30:16] let's not go off without christ let's
[30:19] be a part of the last call which is
[30:22] go into the highways and byways and
[30:25] compel them to come in
[30:26] go into the gutters let's pray
[30:30] heavenly father we asked lord that
[30:35] there would be a a true book of acts
[30:39] heart
[30:40] in us that would produce another book of
[30:44] acts behind it lord
[30:46] if any of us me included
[30:50] have gone off on tantrums gone off
[30:53] in the direction that we should not have
[30:56] gone and focusing on things that
[30:58] we shouldn't focus on lord please
[31:01] please help us please deliver us please
[31:03] correct us
[31:05] please give us this heart
[31:08] help us to be rugged christians not
[31:11] needing to be
[31:12] patted and babied but looking for the
[31:14] approval
[31:16] of you lord not of man
[31:20] lord you're our leader you're the one
[31:23] who guides us you're the one who directs
[31:25] us
[31:26] and we want to be led by you in
[31:28] everything father and when we know that
[31:30] each of us
[31:30] as individuals are led by your spirit it
[31:33] produces
[31:34] what a beautiful harmony and unity but
[31:37] when we step out
[31:39] and are not led by your spirit that
[31:42] creates such a disunity among us lord
[31:46] and it's like pulling pulling in the
[31:49] wrong direction
[31:51] but lord may your holy spirit just come
[31:53] upon us give us that
[31:54] book of acts vision and nature
[31:58] lord that burden for lost souls
[32:01] that passion lord we ask these things in
[32:04] jesus name
[32:05] amen god bless you
