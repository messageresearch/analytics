[5:52] that we have to come to your house
[5:55] we thank you Lord because we know how
[5:58] different this day could have been
[6:00] we offer prayer Lord for the Saints
[6:04] um Lord down in western Florida
[6:07] Lord who suffered such a Devastation to
[6:11] their cities we thank you for the
[6:13] reports that the Believers are all well
[6:15] and Lord we're thanking you for sparing
[6:17] Our Fair City once more as you have done
[6:20] so many times in the past we give you
[6:22] thanks this morning we ask you now to
[6:24] take us into your word Lord lead us and
[6:27] guide us now and to everything that you
[6:30] have for us in Jesus name amen God bless
[6:33] you friends let's turn to the Book of
[6:35] Psalms chapter 47.
[6:39] praise the Lord
[6:43] I
[6:45] was secretly
[6:46] coveting to
[6:49] take the Sunday school class today and
[6:53] it turned out to my favor at the last
[6:55] minute
[6:56] and so um
[6:58] I was asked if I could jump in brother
[7:00] Matt had a wonderful lesson lined up for
[7:02] us but we had a few technical issues he
[7:05] needed to attend to and I was just
[7:07] wanting so bad to teach the Sunday
[7:09] school class so I thank the Lord both
[7:11] Tom I think he heard my prayer and saw
[7:13] the burden on me amen happy to have
[7:15] sister Amy's family here with us today
[7:18] amen and so let's look in in Psalms
[7:22] chapter 47 and we're just going to read
[7:24] one verse and we will let you be seated
[7:27] straight away Psalms 47 and 4 you have
[7:31] it say Amen
[7:32] excuse me
[7:35] he shall choose our inheritance for us
[7:39] isn't that beautiful look at it again he
[7:42] shall choose our inheritance for us the
[7:46] Excellency of Jacob whom he loved Sila
[7:50] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[7:53] word you can be seated
[8:03] praise the Lord
[8:06] now
[8:08] when we look into prayer and I want to
[8:12] take today a title the way of prayer
[8:16] there it is the way of prayer the lord
[8:19] gave me this thought actually some time
[8:21] ago and uh just ruminating on it and a
[8:26] little here a little there amen until it
[8:29] seemed like the Lord just rushed in on
[8:31] me the other morning up early and just I
[8:34] thought wow I sure would love to take
[8:36] the Sunday school but I guess I'll carry
[8:37] it for Wednesday night but amen and I'm
[8:40] careful not to do that on purpose
[8:41] because I promised Lord many years ago I
[8:43] would never do that if he gave me a
[8:45] thought for a sermon I wouldn't play the
[8:47] human part and go I'm going to save that
[8:49] for a lot of people or a big crowd of
[8:52] the service I want to preach it in and
[8:54] the Lord knows that's one of the
[8:57] promises among the few that I've kept
[9:00] for him and never kept to him and never
[9:02] broken I've broken plenty of them but
[9:03] never that one by his grace
[9:06] I don't know if you have the Amplified
[9:08] version there on the on the machine
[9:10] Brother Jay but if you could put that up
[9:13] if you do I'm going to read it
[9:14] regardless I want you to think about
[9:16] this 47th Psalm this fourth verse of the
[9:20] 47th Psalm and the Amplified it reads he
[9:24] chose our inheritance for us the glory
[9:29] and pride of Jacob whom he loves and
[9:33] you'll notice that word see law that
[9:35] means to pause and calmly think on that
[9:39] and I would like for you to do that this
[9:41] morning uh I'll just give you a few
[9:44] moments to pause and think about what
[9:47] he's saying here he chooses our
[9:51] inheritance for us
[9:56] isn't that wonderful think about that he
[10:00] chooses our inheritance for us then how
[10:04] should we pray
[10:06] what should be the approach angle when
[10:09] we pray what should be on the front of
[10:12] our mind not just in the back of our
[10:14] mind well hey I know he chooses my life
[10:16] but I got these needs and I got these
[10:18] desires and I'm going to go to prayer
[10:19] and ask him for him wait a minute
[10:21] he chooses our inheritance
[10:25] for us and catch it the glory and
[10:29] Excellence of Jacob so this is like a
[10:31] love letter of God saying listen I love
[10:34] you so much that I'm just going to go
[10:37] ahead and choose all your inheritance
[10:38] for you and set it out in front of you
[10:39] and I'm going to put you on the path and
[10:41] if you just follow me and trust me
[10:45] everything will turn out great
[10:48] Jeremiah chapter 29 I love this it's of
[10:52] we probably could almost quote this from
[10:54] our days and Sunday school class
[10:55] Jeremiah 29 11 brother Jason
[10:59] for I know the thoughts that I think
[11:03] toward you saith the Lord thoughts of
[11:07] peace and not of evil to give you an
[11:10] expected end think about that to give
[11:13] you an expected end in other words you
[11:17] know there there's one um uh the the one
[11:21] translation from Eugene Peterson's
[11:23] translation called the message I love it
[11:25] he says this is what God is saying to
[11:28] you in Jeremiah 29 11. I know what I'm
[11:31] doing
[11:32] yeah
[11:33] I have it all planned out
[11:36] plans to take care of you
[11:39] not abandon you
[11:41] plans to give you the future you hope
[11:44] for
[11:45] now I'm I'm not so uh you know spoiled
[11:49] as to think that that I want what I want
[11:53] regardless of the cost I know this I
[11:56] want to stand and sing on that Shore
[11:59] that's what I know that's my hope forth
[12:02] I say Lord that's my All My Hope Is I
[12:05] stand and sing on that Shore and the
[12:07] Lord is saying to me I know I know the
[12:09] thoughts that I think towards you saith
[12:11] the Lord thoughts of peace and not of
[12:14] evil to give you an expected end to give
[12:17] you that desire of your heart
[12:21] many Haskins years ago Point
[12:26] wrote a poem called God knows it's one
[12:28] of my favorite poems of all time and I
[12:31] love poetry and especially of the
[12:34] spiritual kind and and she lived from
[12:38] 1875 to 1957. this is actually King
[12:42] George at the beginning of World War II
[12:45] read uh from a portion of this poem as
[12:51] England was committing its sons and uh
[12:54] and uh to war knowing that there would
[12:57] be the loss of millions and and so it
[13:01] refers to the man who stood at the Gate
[13:03] of the year now that's a metaphor uh you
[13:06] know we're coming to a new year and
[13:09] we're actually approaching a new year a
[13:11] year we never thought we would approach
[13:13] but we are so I just say let's fight on
[13:16] see he he he he's got it all planned
[13:20] amen
[13:22] so you can see why Jesus would would say
[13:24] be anxious for nothing all right because
[13:27] when you get anxious and and this is uh
[13:30] brother Branham talked about that and
[13:31] brother Branham called it a plague the
[13:34] nervousness of this age it's a nervous
[13:37] neurotic time of anxiety and anxiousness
[13:40] and brother Branham called it a part of
[13:42] the plague that that's upon this it's
[13:45] part of that seventh vial that affects
[13:48] the minds of men we've been preaching on
[13:50] but she she talks about it in this way I
[13:53] love this is the portion I'm always fond
[13:55] of quoting
[13:57] so she's in a metaphorical position
[14:00] coming to the man who stands at the Gate
[14:02] of the year and she's got to go through
[14:04] the gate you know and into the new year
[14:07] and so she says Miss Haskins says and I
[14:12] said to the man who stood at the Gate of
[14:14] the year
[14:15] oh if I can get through this give me a
[14:18] light that I may tread safely into the
[14:21] unknown
[14:22] and he replied
[14:24] go out into the darkness and put your
[14:27] hand into the hand of God that shall be
[14:30] to you better than light and safer than
[14:33] a known way
[14:35] so I went forth and finding the hand of
[14:38] God trod gladly into the night and he
[14:42] led me toward the hills and the breaking
[14:45] over the day in the lone East so heart
[14:47] be still what need our little life our
[14:52] human life to know if God hath
[14:54] comprehension in all the Dizzy Strife of
[14:58] things both high and low God hideth his
[15:01] intention
[15:02] amen
[15:04] God has a secret will
[15:08] and God doesn't always reveal his will
[15:11] to you up front that's why I read psalms
[15:14] 47 and Jeremiah saying I know my I've
[15:18] got it all fixed I've got it all planned
[15:20] I know my thoughts for you they're not
[15:22] evil they're for your good see
[15:25] so God has a secret will that he doesn't
[15:29] always reveal to us on a day-to-day
[15:31] basis he might not reveal the next
[15:34] several hours of future to you or the
[15:38] next several days or weeks or months or
[15:40] years but he is saying to you I will get
[15:43] you home
[15:45] he doesn't always explain his plan for
[15:48] you in any particular situation so now I
[15:53] come back to my to my basis how should
[15:57] we pray
[15:59] what should be our attitude in prayer
[16:03] how should we approach it what should be
[16:05] our expectations see
[16:07] you know it's all about
[16:09] your attitude
[16:11] you know you know as parents a child's
[16:14] attitude in a request can be the
[16:17] difference between life and between
[16:19] getting it and not getting it
[16:21] [Music]
[16:23] between getting it and not getting it
[16:26] amen
[16:28] um let me stop right there not going to
[16:30] go to husbands and wives
[16:31] [Laughter]
[16:36] but he doesn't always explain his plan
[16:38] for you in a particular situation in
[16:41] fact is you may get you may get no
[16:44] advanced warning
[16:46] of something coming and you may get no
[16:49] explanation at all after it has happened
[16:52] something that you did don't favor
[16:55] something you wouldn't have chosen for
[16:57] yourself you go down a path you say I've
[16:59] had I known I would have never well
[17:02] someone knew see and it's very likely
[17:06] the one who built the path
[17:09] God has a will that he keeps secret why
[17:12] why does he do that so he can bring it
[17:15] to pass without you running ahead of him
[17:18] and interfering
[17:19] that's really even on the good things
[17:22] because I can promise you you can't make
[17:24] anything come out as good as God can
[17:28] and you can look at an opportunity and
[17:30] say man I know how to maximize this no
[17:32] you don't
[17:34] you're totally inexperienced in future
[17:37] planning
[17:38] but you see trust put your hand in the
[17:41] hand of God you don't need a light I'm
[17:43] going to give you an idea of something
[17:45] that'll be better than a light
[17:47] and it'll be safer than a known way
[17:50] see
[17:52] so sometimes he he does that to keep you
[17:56] from running ahead to keep you from
[17:57] interfering as many Haskins said God
[18:00] hideth his intention
[18:02] but he always now and I want to say this
[18:06] because you know her she ends that part
[18:09] of it with God hides his intentions now
[18:11] I want to say to you with more perfect
[18:13] understanding from the scripture he
[18:16] always actually he he hides sometimes
[18:19] what he's doing and he hides what's
[18:22] about to happen to you he hides his
[18:24] plans he has them
[18:26] but he hides them but what he doesn't
[18:29] hide really is his intention by that I
[18:33] mean he never hides his motive and his
[18:35] objective his his objective is for your
[18:38] Perfection he says that in the Bible
[18:39] don't think it's strange the fiery
[18:42] trials that come your way because
[18:43] therefore you're good that's his goal
[18:46] Therefore your perfection even if
[18:48] they're fiery
[18:51] he says that
[18:53] I I have plans for your good we read it
[18:56] in Jeremiah not for evil so no I
[18:59] actually do know his intention even if I
[19:02] don't know his plan
[19:04] and even if I didn't get a pre-warning
[19:06] and even if it's bad and even if he
[19:08] won't tell me why I do know his
[19:10] intention
[19:11] his intention is love
[19:14] so how should we pray
[19:15] [Music]
[19:18] that's my subject today
[19:20] how should we pray
[19:25] his revealed will brother Branham has
[19:28] taught us is always his word
[19:31] and he gives his word to mankind to lead
[19:34] him and God will never reveal something
[19:36] to you contrary to his word
[19:41] amen if you think that you have an
[19:43] understanding of God's will you're going
[19:47] to have to make sure to qualify it by
[19:49] the word of God because God will never
[19:52] go outside of his will this is why
[19:54] brother Brandon would say anything
[19:55] outside the line in order of his word
[19:57] fails so you want to make sure that your
[20:00] life is going forward that you're living
[20:02] the kind of life according to his word
[20:05] you're living the kind of life he can
[20:07] get behind
[20:08] and prosper that life he has a will and
[20:12] a prescribed path for our lives to
[20:16] follow and very often it can be kept
[20:19] secret at the start a will sometimes
[20:23] that he makes clear by measure but in in
[20:28] in all of it he wants us
[20:30] to trust him
[20:33] so how should we pray
[20:37] he wants us to trust him when we say
[20:41] thy will be done that's what Jesus said
[20:43] he was the Prototype he gave us an
[20:46] example
[20:47] see he was Jesus the Christ and and the
[20:51] Christ is the anointed word some Jesus
[20:53] life was a blueprint for when it would
[20:55] be your turn to be the word made flesh
[20:58] so when he says thy will be done
[21:02] see that's how he taught us to pray he
[21:05] set the example in the Garden of
[21:06] Gethsemane when you don't know God's
[21:10] will and you're in a terrible fix in a
[21:12] terrible situation and you say brother
[21:14] Jason I've prayed and God won't reveal
[21:17] his will to me I don't know what to do
[21:19] well you can always fall back on not my
[21:22] will but thine be done
[21:25] amen so there's no out here
[21:27] you're not going to do an end around on
[21:29] God God has this lesson today is about
[21:32] teaching you the approach to prayer and
[21:35] what should be our attitude see and so
[21:39] when we say thy will be done you need to
[21:42] understand that we are agreeing to his
[21:45] secret will for us
[21:48] so when you pray they said Lord teach us
[21:50] how to pray Our Father Who Art in Heaven
[21:52] and he goes on down this prayer you know
[21:55] you know and and and he we're looking to
[21:58] make the Earthly image match the
[22:01] Heavenly image see that's that's that's
[22:03] what his prayer is All About You Know
[22:06] Thy will be done on on Earth in this
[22:08] Earth as it is in heaven whatever is
[22:10] your word whatever is your vision for my
[22:12] life that's my prayer that this life
[22:15] matched that one
[22:17] whatever it takes to get me to that do
[22:20] it here
[22:23] so we are agreeing to his secret will
[22:25] for us to be you know to be slowly
[22:28] revealed and it will be slowly revealed
[22:31] but oftentimes by unfolding as we
[22:34] continue to trust and follow
[22:37] amen
[22:39] regardless of circumstances wow
[22:43] God first tells the Exiles give me
[22:46] Jeremiah 29 again
[22:48] brother Jason and let's look at verses
[22:51] 10 and 11.
[22:53] Jeremiah 29 10 11 for thus saith the
[22:57] Lord that after 70 years be accomplished
[23:00] at Babylon I will visit you and perform
[23:03] my good word toward you in causing you
[23:06] to return to this place
[23:09] for I know the thoughts that I think
[23:12] toward you saith the Lord thoughts of
[23:14] peace and not of evil to give you an
[23:15] expected end they're headed into 70
[23:18] years of imprisonment
[23:20] of Babylonian captivity where their
[23:23] hearts become so sad that they sit by
[23:25] the river and the Babylonians say wow
[23:28] when we first took you guys in my
[23:30] goodness you had all these songs and you
[23:32] played these wonderful instruments and
[23:34] you had the joy of your God in you and
[23:36] man you you you you made you made all of
[23:39] Babylon Mary and and we were we were
[23:41] almost happy to capture you and but you
[23:44] know play play for us those songs again
[23:46] and the Jews said how can we
[23:49] how can we sing the songs of joy and
[23:52] happiness when our hearts are broken
[23:54] because we're held captive here
[23:58] what what we're starting to learn is
[24:01] is that God first tells the Exiles what
[24:05] he will do
[24:06] and why see he's actually telling them
[24:10] here's what I'm going to do and here's
[24:13] you know why I'm doing it I made it
[24:15] clear in my Prophet Jeremiah has already
[24:18] told you
[24:19] you went away from me you backslid it
[24:22] from my will you're here for punishment
[24:24] uh Hannah lied to you he was a he was a
[24:29] false anointed person he was a true
[24:31] anointing but a false messenger because
[24:33] he prophesied you contrary to my will
[24:35] and told you contrary to what Jeremiah
[24:37] told you he told you two years that's
[24:40] not going to happen I killed him
[24:42] yeah amen amen and what I told you is
[24:46] going to come to pass you're going to be
[24:48] here for 70 years and now you know
[24:52] what's going to happen and now you know
[24:54] why it's going to happen and therefore
[24:56] what should be the attitude of their
[24:59] prayer
[25:01] they should pray accordingly and then
[25:05] verse 12 give me verse 12.
[25:08] then shall you call upon me and ye shall
[25:11] go and pray unto me and I will hearken
[25:15] to you so he first tells them what he'll
[25:17] do he then tells him why he did it and
[25:20] then they are to pray accordingly and
[25:22] then God will hear them pray accordingly
[25:24] pray according to his will I'm going to
[25:27] be here 70 years he doesn't want me to
[25:30] ask him
[25:32] yeah let me go in 20 years
[25:35] that's not his will
[25:37] he's already gave them his will he's
[25:39] already told them what he's doing it
[25:41] he's already told them it's to restore
[25:43] them and he will restore them and they
[25:45] need not fear it but they need to say
[25:47] thy will be done that should be their
[25:53] prayer what should be your prayer
[25:57] friends see
[25:59] so those who seek God
[26:02] where the whole heart will find him look
[26:04] at verse 13 and 14 brother Jason verse
[26:07] 13 and ye shall seek me and find me when
[26:10] ye shall search for me with all your
[26:12] heart and I will be found of you isn't
[26:14] that beautiful saith the Lord and I will
[26:16] turn away your captivity after 70 years
[26:19] and I will gather you from all the
[26:22] nations from all the places with her I
[26:23] have driven you saith the Lord and I
[26:25] will bring you again into this place
[26:26] once I caused you to be carried away
[26:30] captive so those who seek God with a
[26:33] whole heart will find him those who are
[26:36] willing to accept his will for their
[26:38] life and pray I'm gonna I got a little
[26:40] bit to say about that in the main
[26:42] service today I don't want to jump into
[26:43] that but but you know we shouldn't
[26:45] complain about the way that God has set
[26:47] for us
[26:48] see
[26:50] he knows what he's doing
[26:53] and so prayer is not trying to get God
[26:56] to do something he might not otherwise
[26:58] do
[27:00] I want to say that again prayer is not
[27:02] something it's not a tool
[27:04] to be used to try to get God to do
[27:07] something he might not otherwise do
[27:10] it's not like you're rushing into the
[27:12] throne and saying God I got a better
[27:13] idea than you how about this
[27:16] yes sir
[27:19] not amazing I mean how many times have
[27:21] we done that
[27:24] yeah
[27:26] it's not trying to get God to do
[27:28] something he might not otherwise do
[27:30] rather I gotta hurry rather it is
[27:33] aligning our thoughts
[27:36] our desires and and and and and our
[27:41] thoughts and our desires and our will
[27:44] with God so that's the primary function
[27:49] of Prayer
[27:52] not not to fix God to fix you
[27:56] see
[27:57] not that he needs an attitude adjustment
[28:00] you do not that he needs to understand
[28:02] what's really going on I promise you he
[28:05] understands it infinitely better than
[28:06] you do see
[28:09] yes and so you know we we must align our
[28:13] thoughts and our desires with God's
[28:15] revealed will as we consider our
[28:18] circumstances
[28:20] consider our circumstances in light of
[28:24] what he has revealed to us so if his
[28:27] revealed will is for you to have more
[28:30] love and more patience and more faith
[28:33] then don't pray against the methodology
[28:35] he uses
[28:37] to get you there
[28:38] and question him
[28:41] amen
[28:43] see we're learning we're learning how to
[28:45] pray aren't we
[28:48] so we ask him to do his will
[28:52] uh give me Matthew 6 10 brother Jason
[28:56] let's look at this one verse here in
[28:57] Matthew 6 10.
[29:00] thy kingdom come
[29:03] thy will be done in earth this Earth
[29:09] and in my life
[29:11] in Earth in my life in this body as it
[29:15] is in heaven so we ask him to do his
[29:18] will God speaks first God speaks and we
[29:22] respond to his word
[29:26] amen see
[29:28] so he initiates
[29:30] prayer how does God what is what is what
[29:34] is God when he's
[29:35] calling upon you to pray he initiates
[29:39] Prayer by revealing his will because
[29:42] true prayer is always that that God will
[29:46] fulfill his revealed will so I don't
[29:50] need him to spell out what's happening
[29:52] tomorrow or what's happening today I
[29:55] don't need to know the why see I just
[29:57] when I go to prayer my my goal is is to
[30:02] build up my faith to trust in him he
[30:07] hears me when I pray and I and I know if
[30:10] I ask according to his word that he
[30:13] heareth me the Bible says that that you
[30:15] can know that he hears you and when you
[30:17] know that he hears you you know what you
[30:19] have what you've asked for what should
[30:21] we be asking for Lord align my will with
[30:24] your will my life with your life help me
[30:27] that's that's what prayer is four
[30:31] is to get you conditioned to walk in
[30:36] faith because whatsoever is not faith is
[30:38] sin
[30:40] so when we don't know the details of his
[30:43] will
[30:44] as I said to you we can follow the
[30:47] example of Jesus yet not what I will but
[30:50] what you will you can read that in Mark
[30:52] chapter 14. as his adopted children
[30:55] that's what we are
[30:57] we are adopted through the faith of
[30:59] Abraham we are adopted into the family
[31:01] of Christ I want to tell you something
[31:03] friends you can rest confident that
[31:05] whatever he ordains will ultimately be
[31:09] for our joy and His glory
[31:15] now could you want a better outcome than
[31:17] that
[31:18] say Lord I don't know all the why I
[31:21] don't even know the what I'm not even
[31:23] sure what's the question that I need to
[31:26] ask
[31:27] but but here's what I know I know what
[31:30] your intentions are I've read in the
[31:32] Bible that you have ordained my path
[31:34] I've read in Psalms 47 I've read in
[31:36] Jeremiah 29 29 that that that you have
[31:39] thoughts of good and not for evil
[31:42] Psalms 47 do you have the NLT New Living
[31:46] Translation Jay Psalms 47 1.
[31:51] in the NLT come everyone
[31:55] clap your hands
[31:57] shout to God with joyful praise for the
[32:01] Lord most high is awesome he is the
[32:05] great king of all the Earth he subdues
[32:08] the Nations before us putting our
[32:10] enemies beneath our feet he chose the
[32:13] promised land as our inheritance the
[32:17] proud possession of Jacob's descendants
[32:19] whom he loves
[32:22] Sila interlude think on that God has a
[32:27] plan God knows what he's doing with our
[32:30] lives
[32:31] and that my friends
[32:34] is the way of Prayer
[32:36] God bless you we'll have an intermission
[32:38] I went one minute over apologize to
[32:40] brother Tony God bless you we'll see you
[32:43] in the main service
