[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] let's pray father we thank you very kindly for our wonderful beautiful morning that we have here beautiful outside inside and all around Lord and we have the beauty of thy presence here this morning and we are looking now father to go into your word and break down this lesson for our Sunday school class this morning we're praying for all of the various families Lord who are out traveling in Ministry team deployed around ministering be with us here now I pray in Jesus name amen God bless you friends we're going to invite you to Second Corinthians chapter five and we'll just catch um a couple of verses here and then I'll let you be seated and we'll carry on brother Matt and I have swapped today and I'll give a little bit of an update on my continuing battle with the devil amen the shingles outbreak that I had about four weeks ago as continues to fight against me and then a lot of other different complications have Arisen because of it mostly medication extended medication so I covet your prayers amen right Amen brother Donald I know I can count on your prayers for sure and so um just trusting the Lord for it I um I'm going to say it now and I'm going to say it again if I can think about it in all of this on all of this trial I have I have a brand new not brand new because I've had it before but I have a further appreciation for the fact that the devil ain't nobody amen and I see that now more than anything and I think that burns him because I don't I don't consider him I'm not afraid of him he's no threat to me amen amen so we are trusting in the Lord for his grace second Corinthians chapter 5 I want to take a lesson this morning persuading you to live higher persuading you to live higher Paul speaking in second Corinthians 5 verses 10 11 for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in this body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad verse 11 knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but but we are made manifest unto God and I trust also our made manifest in your consciences amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated thank you I want to catch another scripture here Paul's saying here in our in our opening text concerning how that he persuades men and you know that's that's the very title Paul's saying here that knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade Men Moving to Galatians the first chapter Paul again speaking verse 9 and 10. as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then that ye have received let him be accursed for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men for if I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ and so Paul is trying to make a couple of points here that I'm chaining together one is that he's not afraid to try to persuade men and when we talk about persuading persuasion I want to look at a number of things today but we're we're we're certainly going to be talking about far more than just psychology we're talking about more than just mental persuasion now there's a there's a necessity of that because even the right mental attitude towards the word of God brings it to pass and brother Branham has taught us that Revelation starts in the mind it starts here you have to come to an agreement by God's grace you can't do it on your own the human mind is enmity against God but God by his grace allows you to agree with his word and brother Brown said as soon as he can get you to agree with his word then that then that then that annihilates the old nature and a new birth occurs and then that that drops down into your heart from your head to your heart and it becomes a revelation which when we say the word revelation we mean a living Revelation a living reality I believe that it should change our lives there are many ways to persuade someone to live at a higher standard in their life I think about this a lot as a minister of the Gospel how can I persuade people how can I beg how can I plead how can I find a way to be a counter offensive a counter tactic to the enemy because I know the enemies in your ear I know for sure the enemies in your teenager's ear and so uh you know I I'm not afraid to engage him and get in your ear also because I have a supernatural weapon and you know there are a number of persuasive ways and there's a lot you know a lot of you know a lot of this stuff I you know they they tried to cram in me in marketing school and things like that but but you know uh I'm a gospel preacher you know and that stuff I'm like I'll just go right by bypass all that stuff because I want to cut to the word amen I I find that in the word of God there is the superpower there is a persuasion called economic persuasion where you know if you're trying to persuade someone you can let them know that hey you know you you need to take this deal because here's an economic persuasion this thing this deal is only going to last so long and you could miss out on a great opportunity to save some money or miss on an opportunity to make some money the whole world gets persuaded daily by economic Persuasions good and bad ones real and false ones there is the what they call the moral persuasion where you know you you let the the person know that that by by by by coming to um to improve themselves that they can make the world a better place they can make those around them uh have a better atmosphere I think the moral persuasion is a good one I think that you know I'm not I'm not worried about economic persuasion uh because that's just the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and Satan's a god of economics and don't ever imagine he's going to let it go smooth for God's family but I'm glad we got promises but I love the moral persuasion to say to you that you know I want to encourage you to live a higher standard that's what I'm speaking on today persuading you to live higher there is the social persuasion this is an interesting one uh it's basically saying uh you need to do this because everybody else is doing it and uh you know the devil loves that when he uses that one you know well and I just say well if he uses that one well you know why shouldn't I use it because you know I I'm not here with his kind of of of social persuasion to say to you you know all the say to you sisters all the Hollywood starlets are doing it why don't you do it too that's the devil's argument my argument is listen sisters there's other sisters around you striving you're not in this alone Brothers there's other men striving I want to give you today a social persuasion you have a family of God gathered around you I say to young people you have parents you have ministers let me persuade you to say that there are other people who are overcoming I remember when I asked our resident superhero sister Gene how in the world she was so okay and I quite seriously I was so shocked you know here she loses a husband of 60 plus years and a son of 50 years and all in the space of 13 months and I and I said to her I said Mom and people are asking me how is she she just seems so strong I said Mom how are you okay and she said you know she said I I have my times when I cry she said I I'm I'm grieving she said I said but how do you how do you how do you come out every day and you just seem okay she said Jason I have to be okay and I said what is that what does that mean she said I'm not the first daughter of God down through centuries to lose a husband and lose a child she said there have been many Gallant women Mighty women of God before me who lost husbands and who lost sons and who lost more than I've lost and they pressed on and they kept carrying on oh it was such an inspiration to me you know that there are people around you striving there are people around you pressing the battle to reach the millennial world to finish the race you know the people who reach it will have completed a race I think about that you know that that I didn't step aside with the world and come up short I want to make the millennium I want to I want to finish this race I don't want to be stepped uh moved aside uh and you know pull off into an emergency Lane and Coast to a stop because I'm all out of gas or or My you know I haven't maintained my Christian Life no I want to run this race and I want to persuade you to live higher with me I want to persuade you to say let's press on to the millennium see and so you know we there's all kinds of ways we could go on and on about you know talk persuading people you know serving God is a way of expressing our love and our gratitude to him uh you know for all that he has done for us so when I am persuading people to live higher you know I I want to remind people just how very much that you owe the Lord say how much do I owe him nothing short of everything that we were all on our way to hell and no way to stop it except God rich in Mercy and so when we when we when we segue to that and we say serving God is a way expressing our love and our gratitude then according to the Bible we and I want to just give and I'm not going to take you into the scriptures today because you're there you trust me they'll be familiar to you I'm just going to quote from them somewhat in paraphrase but according to the Bible that there are a number of ways to serve God first of all loving him with all your heart and all your soul and all your mind you know Christianity has sometimes standardized answers almost sometimes I think sometimes it almost comes across as canned answers almost like wow surely there's more to it than just a you know a canned answer I think that you know we talk about loving our neighbor as ourself we talk about being kind to strangers we talk about praying for those in need we talk about you know sharing things and and and and and Jesus talks about if someone needs this and give them that plus this and if they ask you to walk this far you walk that Farm you know we you know we think about widows and orphans and and all of these things but a lot of times those can become not so much um they are a higher standard not against those things but I think that it ought to come from our heart it ought to not just to be a higher standard to me I guess is what I'm trying to say is that a higher standard is not just regulations that you can move up the the list and live uh higher standards than that you know you know we can talk about being holy and avoiding sin these are ways to live higher discovering and being willing to use and as the Bible says exercising our gifts you know Christianity to me is an active lifestyle it's not passive it's not just you know I I'm just I I you would never know I'm a Christian unless I tell you I am no I believe a Christian lifestyle is an active I think it has an aura I think it projects I find that when love projects Grace takes over and so so when we when we think about being willing to go the extra mile and being willing to exercise our gifts and being willing being willing to reach out there and and expend our energy and expend our resources that's what being a Christian really is see doing everything here's another good one doing everything now catch this doing everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ whatsoever you do in word or deed you're supposed to do all to me that has always said to me that whatever I cannot do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I should not do if there's ever a question in your life and say is this right or wrong just ask yourself can I can you say that cruel cutting sentence to a friend in the name of Jesus Christ could a husband cut a wife down or a wife cut a husband down could you do that in the name of Jesus Christ teenagers could you could you mistreat one another in the name of Jesus Christ could you disrespect the ministry in the name of Jesus Christ I think not I think not could we find ourselves out living a life of carnality so that the world doesn't really notice a fervent lifestyle I don't think you can do that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so so we need to do everything we need to be steadfast we need to be immovable abounding in the work of the Lord presenting our bodies as Living Sacrifice this is me today persuading you to live higher to live more mature to live more spiritual to to present your bodies a Living Sacrifice to be steadfast to be immovable to be abounding in the work of the law Lord not just when it's convenient to me this is exactly why the most important way to serve God is to love him to me that has to be the basis of it all to love him with all of our heart as I said with all of our soul and all of our mind it's it it literally loving God let me say it like this loving God is what makes your works perfect because if you're just doing them as Works they're they're of no use to God your best efforts are filthiness to him so the only way to have your works perfect is to love God and if you if you work out of love for God then it doesn't really matter what the work is it doesn't matter you don't have to do everything I do I don't have to do everything you do we love God see and so so to me this is what Jesus said was actually the greatest commandment and is really to me the natural everyday life of a Christian when we love God I find that in my experience that I naturally obey him it it's it it's it's not even second nature it is my nature because my love for God and even if I Stumble I I I I I'm very quick to correct and repent and ask the Lord to help me see because because loving God is the foundation of my service to him it means it means more than anything in the world to me it's everything and so so so you know when I say that I love God I'm saying that I love him with all of my emotions I love him with all of my desires I love him with all of my affections can you say that today to say my affections are set on things above you know not on this world but with all of its distractions and and sidebars it means to have a passionate Devotion to him and and I and and I say a delight in his presence for me friends I can tell you this many years walking this road as a Christian man there is nothing more refreshing than the presence of God there is nothing more strength giving nothing more cleansing nothing more invigorating and renewing of my mind nothing will alleviate stress and anxiety that's a plague you know that's released in the atmospheres that we live in today if brother Branham called it a plague a neurotic age and there is no remedy uh to cure that for the world the only way you deal with that is to escape it into the presence of God see so you're you're it's not you can't pray and say Lord take this from the earth that's not going to happen the Earth is going into madness and you you can't say Lord stop letting the devil put put anxiety on me that's not a prayer God can answer because God has already agreed with Satan to make your mind the Battleground so now he can't very well say to Satan sorry you can't trouble his mind anymore because he asked me not to let you the agreement was the the mind would be the Battleground so so you can't cure the neurotic age and you can't you can't get an injunction against Satan for trying to trouble you what you can do is escape to Jesus what you can do is lift up as an eagle and fly up into higher Realms oh I'm I hope I'm persuading you today to live higher oh my and so you know loving him with all of your heart and all of your soul means to love him with your mind it means to love him with your reasoning it means to love him with your Intel intellect to bring all of your thoughts subject to the word of God loving God with your whole heart your whole mind to me is the greatest commandment because because it's literally if you think of it like this it's literally the foundation of all of other Commandments that loving God with your whole heart and your whole mind and your whole soul that is the foundation of all other Commandments and yet people go at Breakneck speed to do service for God but the love of God is missing from their heart and and and and we there's only one way to get the love of God in your heart it has to be poured in there by the Holy Ghost see and so so we need God's grace and God's power to help us to love him you know as he deserves to be loved because it's you know it I mean really Jesus is the only one if you think about it like this you have no chance to do this Jesus was really the only one to love God perfectly to me what I am aware of that and I realize that I I never can make make that great I Can't Get Enough altitude to do that I can't I I wish I could say that you know the the enemy cometh but he findeth nothing in me there's plenty that he finds in me but when he came to the Lord he had no chance Jesus served God perfectly and the beauty of it is he did it on my behalf and your behalf how could I not love him how could I not want to lift higher see so you know brother Branham May makes this statement here watch he says here in things that are to be now he says let me let me get myself said he says if we I'm doing good man I'm doing good praise the Lord he says now if we are are those attributes of God we cannot live by Creeds say Amen to that we cannot live by denominationalism we can't we can't it's not in us it's uh you know that that eagle has to have a certain kind of food he just can't eat the diet of other foul we must live by the word because the bride here's why because the Bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband see and so so when when there's when there's that love affair going on between a husband and a wife it's it's it's a love affair to the exclusion of all other loves that it loves supremely in it and and it willingly stands to take a vow I will keep to thee only you know and because that's the desire of the heart imagine how Amplified that becomes when you become a living reality of the Holy ghost-filled person and the literal Life of Christ is now living in you as brother JD said permeating throughout your body taking over your thoughts and your mind and your reason reasoning and your intellect and and informing your thinking how that you can go about your daily life and live Higher and Higher and Higher and every day you can wake up and say today I want to live higher than I did yesterday and tomorrow I want to live higher than I do today friends that's got to be let me persuade you today that's got to be a deeply rooted down inside of our soul that we owe him everything that he is our everything he is my everything as we sing the song so we find that we must live by the word because that you're an eagle if you don't feed on the word you won't live very good see you have to eat to live but an eagle can't just eat anything and if you really want to soar higher he's not going to hit those high altitudes if he's not eating good and if you want to have those high altitudes then you know what we must live by the word because the bride because the Bride is a part of the bridegroom so quite naturally this is why brother brothers whole point I can't live by man-made denominations there's no way I can't live by Creeds that that's that that's that's microwave food that's reheated I don't no forget that I gotta have I gotta have a fresh seven course meal see and so so he goes on to say watch he says here and when a child of God when that predestinated seat I love this statement when a child of God when that predestinated seed that you was to be and God called you and that little Eagle seed in there heard the word of God it will build on top one word on top the other one on top the other one on top the other one it'll not mix with any Creed ask God I love this statement here's how you can live higher today ask God to pie a word on top of word like that until you become the full stature a Son of God or a daughter of God I don't have to live this low altitude life I actually can ask God like like the disciples said Jesus for their day how do we meet the challenges Lord teach us how to pray and and and and now here we've got a prophet coming into this day to say listen it's got to be the Holy Ghost has got to come in you and and it begins to grow and I I didn't even put the whole quote on here but brother Branham is referencing if you go back and catch this quote he's referencing your New Birth by the Holy Ghost and he's he he's he's showing you it's got to grow it's got to grow I don't know why that gets lost sometimes on preachers who just who just get this mentality get this tunnel vision that you've got to have this electrifying experience that's a one-off and that's it and you're done and and once you get that you're good no this thing is a daily this thing is a growing this thing is every day yes it starts with an initial New Birth but I'm going to tell you something friends I I'd like to believe that I've come a long way from the day when I receive the Holy Ghost I'd like to believe that I have grown in the stature and the grace of of almighty God do you want to believe that about yourself today say Lord help me how can I how can I overcome Lord how can I reach these high altitudes and when I I was listening to that yesterday and brother Branham just makes it so clear and he says ask God ask him go ahead you've got a prophet's Commission today I'm bringing you a prophetic commission ask God lord how can I live higher how I I feel persuaded how can I move higher and and have my mind and my intellect and my reason and my conscience and my desires and my my goals and my works and my every every facet of my life how can I love you more how can I serve you more how can I be more effective how can I get to the millennium amen are do you feel a little bit persuaded today friends
