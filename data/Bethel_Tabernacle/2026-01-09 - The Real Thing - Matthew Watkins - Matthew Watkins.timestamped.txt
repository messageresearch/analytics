[9:09] Praise the Lord, saints.
[9:11] Happy to be in the house of the Lord
[9:12] tonight. Could we stand and let's just
[9:15] have a word of prayer. Just going to
[9:18] read the book of Psalms 124 if you want
[9:21] to find it.
[9:25] We serve a wonderful God. Amen. Don't
[9:28] you love the Lord? All the wonderful
[9:31] things that he does for us, how he takes
[9:33] care of us.
[9:36] Let's just bow our heads and have a word
[9:37] of prayer.
[9:39] Almighty God, it's always a privilege
[9:41] and an honor. Lord,
[9:44] we thank you, Lord, for this night
[9:45] tonight.
[9:47] Lord, we just thank you for your great
[9:49] words of salvation and light and hope,
[9:53] Lord, and your wonderfulness and your
[9:56] goodness and your grace and your mercy,
[9:59] Lord. I just pray, Father, from the
[10:02] depths of our soul that you would help
[10:04] us tonight to worship you in spirit and
[10:07] in truth. Lord,
[10:10] Father, we thank you for your great and
[10:12] mighty works that you do in each one of
[10:14] us, Lord. We just pray that you'd bless
[10:17] us tonight and just help us now. We
[10:20] thank you for everything.
[10:22] Just pray now in the name of Jesus
[10:24] Christ that you'd bless this service.
[10:28] Amen. And amen. And in the book of
[10:30] Psalms 124, it says, "If it had not been
[10:34] for the Lord who was on our side, now
[10:38] may Israel say, "If it had not been the
[10:41] Lord who was on our side, when men rose
[10:44] up against us, then they had swallowed
[10:47] us up quick. When their wrath was
[10:49] kindled against us, then the waters had
[10:53] overwhelmed us. The stream had gone over
[10:56] our soul. Then the proud waters had gone
[10:59] over our soul. But blessed be the Lord
[11:03] who hath not given us as a prey to their
[11:06] teeth. Aren't you glad for that? Our
[11:10] soul is escaped as a bird out of the
[11:13] snare of the fowlers. The snare is
[11:16] broken and we are escaped.
[11:18] Our help is in the name of the Lord who
[11:22] made heaven and earth. Amen.
[11:27] Let's just worship him tonight.
[11:31] Thank you, dear God.

[11:49] when all things that surround become
[11:53] shadows

[18:49] and you crush it or a flower and aroma
[18:52] comes, right?
[18:55] That's what's supposed to happen to us.

[41:13] read a portion of scripture. Then I'll
[41:15] have you be seated.
[41:17] Acts chapter 2.

[41:57] said unto them,"Repent and be baptized,
[41:59] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[42:02] Christ for the remission of sins, and
[42:04] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[42:07] Ghost, for the promise is unto you and
[42:09] to your children, and to all that are a
[42:12] far off, even as many as the Lord our
[42:15] God shall call." And with many other
[42:18] words did he testify and exhort, saying,
[42:20] "Save yourselves from this untored
[42:23] generation." Notice here in verse 41,
[42:25] then they that gladly received his word
[42:29] were baptized. Aren't you glad that
[42:31] something in your heart could receive
[42:33] his word.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. They that were gladly received
[42:36] were baptized in the same day that were
[42:39] added unto them about 3,000 souls. Amen.
[42:43] I just would uh have you maybe turn to
[42:45] the book of Galatians chapter 3. We'll
[42:47] just read one more scripture before you
[42:49] have you be seated.
[42:54] Amen.
[42:55] Let's just read a few portions. I may
[42:57] get to Galatians 3. I may not tonight
[42:59] depending on time. Brother Brad, when
[43:00] you go to the back, if you could grab my
[43:02] phone. I left it there on the back.
[43:04] Thank you. Oh, foolish Galatians who
[43:07] hath bewitched you that you should not
[43:09] obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus
[43:12] Christ hath been evidently set forth
[43:15] crucified among you. This only what I
[43:18] learn of you. received you the spirit by
[43:22] the works of the law or by the hearing
[43:26] of faith.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Notice verse three. Are you so foolish
[43:30] having begun in the spirit? Are you now
[43:34] made perfect by the flesh?
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Have you suffered so many things in
[43:40] vain,
[43:42] if it be yet in vain?
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Notice verse five. We'll just read these
[43:46] two verses and I'll have you be seated.
[43:48] He therefore that ministerth to you the
[43:51] spirit and workketh miracles among you
[43:53] doth he by the works of the law or by
[43:56] the hearing of faith. Even as Abram
[43:59] believed God and it was accounted to him
[44:03] for righteousness. Lord we just bow our
[44:05] heads together now Lord as one family
[44:09] Lord just your children seed of Abraham
[44:12] Lord we believe that by faith you've
[44:14] passed that promise down to us Lord God.
[44:17] And I pray that you would just come,
[44:19] Lord, make yourself real and alive by
[44:21] your word. I pray, God, that you would
[44:23] help me to deliver this burden that
[44:25] you've placed upon my heart. I pray,
[44:27] God, that you would allow me to
[44:28] communicate it, Lord, in such a way,
[44:30] Lord, that someone could see you more
[44:32] clearly. I pray that you would come and
[44:34] be with us now, one and all. We ask it
[44:36] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You can be
[44:39] seated. God bless you, brother Doug. So
[44:41] good to have you. Amen. Here with us.
[44:43] Good to see you. Amen. I'd like to just
[44:46] begin here and I'm ministering to you,
[44:48] brother Brad. I do have my phone if he
[44:50] hears that. I just had it out of my
[44:51] eyesight there. So, I'm just trying to
[44:54] um Amen. make sure I have that. Good.
[44:57] Amen.
[45:03] Amen. I want to preach to you on the
[45:06] real thing. Now, we know that brother
[45:09] Brandham when he would speak about the
[45:10] Holy Ghost and he takes many different
[45:13] topics, I'm sorry, many different
[45:15] sermons on this and I there there's so
[45:19] many such a a wide uh subject here and
[45:22] so many things that we could say. Um,
[45:24] but I just want to just maybe key in on
[45:27] just a few things and uh and then we'll
[45:29] see where the Lord has it and where the
[45:31] Lord sort of takes us from here. I want
[45:33] to show you something because brother
[45:34] Brandham over and over uh would speak
[45:37] about these three works of grace that
[45:40] happens in the believer's life.
[45:43] Justification and sanctification
[45:47] and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[45:49] and the prophet makes such a statement
[45:51] here and there's a man that can turn on
[45:53] the light in 1963 in December. He said
[45:55] justification served its time in
[45:58] justification under Luther. Then it had
[46:01] to become sanctification through Wesley
[46:04] and sanctification served its time till
[46:07] it become the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[46:10] And the baptism of the Holy Ghost served
[46:13] its time until the Holy Spirit blends
[46:17] into the church and the church into
[46:21] Christ and it makes Jesus Christ
[46:24] reflected on the earth what he promised
[46:26] here in the Bible might not believe it.
[46:29] I can't make you do that. I'm only
[46:30] responsible for the word. So he says
[46:34] justification served its time and then
[46:37] sanctification had to come and then that
[46:39] served its time and he says till it
[46:42] become the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So
[46:44] we've told on this many times here
[46:46] before that we know that brother
[46:47] Brandham wasn't saying that the age of
[46:50] the Holy Ghost would stop to the
[46:53] believer that we would somehow stop
[46:55] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[46:58] But brother Brandham was going to show
[46:59] us that in the restoration of the word,
[47:02] there would come a stage uh that would
[47:05] be called the restoration of the gifts
[47:08] back to the church. And he types this
[47:10] with what he's calling the baptism of
[47:13] the Holy Ghost or what we would say a
[47:15] baptism that is upon our flesh and our
[47:18] flesh only. What we understand is that a
[47:21] baptism on the flesh is a wonderful
[47:24] thing,
[47:25] &gt;&gt; but it's not enough. it doesn't get you
[47:28] in the rapture. And friends, that's
[47:30] really all that I'm interested in.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; And so, a work of the Holy Ghost is a
[47:36] wonderful thing. It's wonderful that God
[47:38] works in your life, but there's got to
[47:40] be something more than just a gift of
[47:43] the Holy Ghost. But, as we heard on
[47:45] Sunday, the giver of the gift must
[47:48] indwell your life. Can you say amen?
[47:52] &gt;&gt; And so, we know this because there's two
[47:54] types. There's actually two baptisms
[47:57] that is actually important for us to
[47:59] receive. One of water and one of spirit.
[48:03] So we live in a western world today in
[48:06] our economy and our politics and our
[48:08] education system. Many times we suffer
[48:11] from a very western view uh or a western
[48:15] understanding through perception and
[48:17] education because our western world is
[48:20] based upon Greek philosophy. You can
[48:23] this is uh permeates our entire culture.
[48:26] It it permeates our our education system
[48:29] and it's not based upon and the reason
[48:31] why that's important and important
[48:33] distinction is because the Bible is not
[48:35] written from a Greek mentality but it's
[48:38] written from a Hebrew mind. And so to
[48:41] understand what God was communicating
[48:43] through the Bible, you can't approach it
[48:46] from your western way of thinking.
[48:48] You've got to go into the Hebrew mind to
[48:51] know what the Bible meant was how it was
[48:54] written to the intent that it was not an
[48:56] education based I'm sorry not a a word
[48:59] based upon Greek philosophy but on
[49:02] Hebrew thinking and oh how different
[49:05] Hebrew thinking is than Greek thinking
[49:08] is it might be hard for you to
[49:10] understand say brother Matt I don't see
[49:11] how that really affects us but the
[49:14] difference between the two is that the
[49:16] Greeks could never tie the natural into
[49:20] the spiritual. So to the Greek, they're
[49:23] two different way, two different things
[49:26] that have no connection to each other.
[49:28] They're always separate. You have the
[49:31] world, the ma or you would call it
[49:33] today, they call it the maverse, the a
[49:35] supernatural unseen realm. And a Greek
[49:38] mind would believe in that unseen realm.
[49:41] But then they believed in a physical
[49:43] realm or a physical dimension, but that
[49:45] there was never any contact between the
[49:48] two dimensions or any connection. So in
[49:51] other words, nothing that you could do
[49:53] naturally could ever affect anything
[49:56] heavenly or vice versa, nothing that
[50:00] could happen in heaven could have any
[50:02] effect on earth. But they're two
[50:04] different spheres and two different
[50:06] circles. And this was a way that that
[50:08] the the the the the mind of the idoltor
[50:11] was that that God had was just a distant
[50:14] god that he wasn't acquainted with
[50:16] natural people or natural ways or
[50:19] natural life. But what we understand
[50:22] that brother Brandham taught us is that
[50:24] the natural actually types the
[50:26] spiritual.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; How many have heard brother Brandham say
[50:29] that nature runs in continuity?
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, brother Brandon would
[50:34] always point to the natural things or
[50:36] things natural as they were a type of
[50:40] something that was taking place in the
[50:41] spiritual. We know this. This is all
[50:43] throughout the message. I don't have to
[50:44] teach on that here tonight. We know
[50:46] brother Brandon preaches countdown four
[50:48] or five times. And in all of those
[50:49] sermons, Brother Brandon makes it so
[50:51] clear that what you see in the natural
[50:53] is only a a evidence, an echo, if you
[50:57] would, of what God was doing in the
[50:59] supernatural. How many members that that
[51:01] he takes the horse and buggy and the
[51:03] discovery of the horse and buggy and he
[51:05] says it was man learning transportation.
[51:08] They move from the horse and buggy to
[51:09] the automobile and then they move from
[51:11] there to the jet aircraft to the
[51:12] astronaut age. And brother Brandon would
[51:14] type that and show that all the way all
[51:17] down throughout history. Science has
[51:19] always just been reflecting what God is
[51:22] doing. So in other words, what you see
[51:24] happening in earth is only because
[51:27] something has taken place in heaven.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:30] Hello. Amen.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; And so what we see going on even in our
[51:34] world today and technology and I'll just
[51:36] say this just uh here I believe that
[51:38] we're even in man has always been in a
[51:41] state of metamorphosis and whether he
[51:44] realized it that the the the it's always
[51:46] a changing ever evolving world.
[51:48] Technology is evolving. Sin is
[51:51] increasing. Sin is maturing. It's what
[51:53] the scripture teaches us that sin is
[51:55] always Satan's Eden is becoming more
[51:58] polished. It's becoming more mature. And
[52:00] so Satan isn't just static and he's just
[52:02] waiting somewhere, you know, back and
[52:04] and and going by the same playbook he
[52:06] did a 100 years ago. No, but actually
[52:08] his Eden would get to such a place to
[52:11] where it would be a a perfection. It
[52:13] would come to its its maturity. And so
[52:16] the tactic that the devil is using today
[52:18] though we can identify it by a spirit
[52:21] that's ancient but his tactic and the
[52:24] way that that's why technology today is
[52:26] moving in the pace that it is.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Remember brother Brandham said this I
[52:30] think this is so profound. I'm just I
[52:32] shared this actually with a brother here
[52:34] recently and I he was sent me just a a
[52:36] video and it was very a great blessing
[52:38] to me of the how the artificial
[52:40] intelligence had created uh the Bible
[52:43] and it and asked it to create the Bible
[52:45] in 5 minutes and it was a pretty
[52:47] powerful video and I and it just struck
[52:50] me when I seen some of the uh some of
[52:52] the way that technology is moving and
[52:55] the way that things are happening at
[52:56] such a rapid pace and I I just I was
[52:59] just writing the brother back and told
[53:01] him that I believe things are moving
[53:04] faster. And and let me just say this,
[53:06] it's going to continue to speed up.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; And and I just I asked myself because he
[53:11] sent me this near Christmas Eve and
[53:13] we're just sitting there, you know, in
[53:14] all of this video of this. Everything
[53:16] that I'm seeing is artificial
[53:18] intelligence. It's, you know, these
[53:19] people that you're seeing look like real
[53:21] actors and real humans and they have the
[53:23] same features and you'd never know the
[53:25] difference that they were that it wasn't
[53:27] real. and he was he was just commenting
[53:30] on can you believe this is this is what
[53:32] our our world has you know has come to
[53:34] to where you can't tell what's fake and
[53:36] what's real and and and a video that
[53:38] looks so real yet it's created by a
[53:41] prompt uh on a computer and then a
[53:43] computer generates that what you've said
[53:46] and I and I just said to him I said it's
[53:48] amazing and I just asked the question I
[53:50] wonder what we will be watching or what
[53:53] will we what we will be in awe of come
[53:56] 2026 December December Christmas of this
[53:58] year.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; It's unpredictable. And so, Brother
[54:02] Brandham says this in the in the seven
[54:04] church ages. He says this in the legacy
[54:05] and church age. And I I don't have any
[54:07] of these up here. You can take that down
[54:09] for now. Uh and just keep that blank.
[54:11] The prophet of God says, "Now the age in
[54:14] which we are living, notice, is going to
[54:16] be a very short one.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Events are going to transpire very
[54:23] rapidly."
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So events, things that we live in
[54:27] is going to be a very short one. Events
[54:30] are going to transpire very rapidly. And
[54:34] we see that here today that technology
[54:37] has reached a place to where it's moving
[54:39] at such a rapid pace, you almost can't
[54:42] keep up. I mean, you're in the stone
[54:44] ages with by the end of the year, your
[54:46] phone is outdated and and uncapable and
[54:49] and you know, not just your phone, but
[54:51] any part of technology. Listen what he
[54:53] says here in the same message. He says,
[54:54] "How strange in this age of plenty, in
[54:57] this age of progress, in this age of
[55:00] abundance, how can there be trials?"
[55:02] Well, now it's strange, but in this age
[55:04] of plenty, opportunity, when everyone
[55:07] has so much and there is so much more to
[55:10] be had with what all the inventions to
[55:14] do our work, I don't know that brother
[55:16] Brandham even knew. I believe his words
[55:18] being prophetic, uh, we see the really
[55:20] what that really means. Now today
[55:22] artificial intelligence is replacing our
[55:25] work.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Modern inventions to do our work for us.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; And he says with all the inventions to
[55:32] do our work and so many things to give
[55:35] us pleasure, suddenly we find mental
[55:38] illness taking such a toll as to alarm
[55:41] the nation when everybody ought to be
[55:43] happy with really nothing to be unhappy
[55:47] about.
[55:49] Amen.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; I mean, if it's so modern and so so
[55:53] advanced
[55:55] &gt;&gt; and everything's so easy, why would
[55:57] anybody be unhappy? This is what brother
[55:59] Adam's saying here, and this is in the
[56:01] 60s. And he says, "Suddenly, we find
[56:03] mental illness when everybody ought to
[56:04] be happy with really nothing to be
[56:07] unhappy about. Millions are taking
[56:09] sedatives at night, pet pills in the
[56:12] morning, rushing to doctors, entering
[56:15] institutions, trying to drown out
[56:17] unknown fears by alcohol.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Yet this age boasts of its tremendous
[56:23] stores of worldly goods. But the people
[56:26] are less happy than ever.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; This age boasts of its spiritual
[56:33] attainment. Spiritual attainment. And he
[56:36] says, "But the people are less sure of
[56:39] themselves than ever. This age boasts of
[56:42] moral values, but it's more corrupt than
[56:45] any age since the flood." It talks about
[56:49] knowledge and science, but it's fighting
[56:52] a losing battle in all fields. Notice,
[56:55] for the human mind and soul and spirit
[56:58] cannot comprehend or keep a breast with
[57:02] all the changes that have come upon the
[57:05] earth.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; In one generation, notice just in one,
[57:10] in one generation, we have gone all the
[57:12] way from the horse and buggy age to the
[57:15] space age.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; And we are proud and boastful about it.
[57:20] But inside is a dark void cavern
[57:25] &gt;&gt; that is crying out in torment.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; And without notice a known reason, men's
[57:31] hearts are felling for fear.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; And the world, brother Brandham says, is
[57:38] so darkened that this age could well be
[57:41] called the age of neurotics.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; It boasts, but it cannot back it up. It
[57:48] cries peace and there is no peace.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; It cries that it has a great multitude
[57:55] of all things but it keeps burning with
[57:58] desire like an unsatisfied
[58:01] fire.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because the Bible says
[58:04] there is no peace to the wicked.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; And everything that they have in this
[58:10] perfect Eden is just a very thin facade.
[58:16] And and so this is the age that that we
[58:18] live in that it's it's a we we're we're
[58:21] this this is a world that has moved very
[58:23] fast. Education is I'm sorry uh uh
[58:27] intelligence has moved to a place to
[58:29] where we have artificial intelligence
[58:32] and we don't know what's real anymore.
[58:34] We we we you don't know what a picture
[58:36] you could define what is even a picture
[58:38] anymore. What is a photo? It used to be,
[58:41] you know, a negative and a positive and
[58:43] taken with light in a lens. Now it's,
[58:45] you know, you could be looking at
[58:46] something and react to something and
[58:48] it's not even real. It was made
[58:50] digitally. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT NOTHING
[58:52] ABOUT IT. Though it looks real though,
[58:54] though it would, you know, it has all
[58:56] the same features. They could fake the
[58:58] lighting that you could tell AI to put,
[59:00] you know, this person and and take the
[59:03] 8K with studio lighting and the light
[59:05] coming from here. And man, you look at
[59:07] that picture and think, "Oh man, that's
[59:09] a REAL PHOTO." YOU KNOW, TAKE A PERSON
[59:11] to say, "Take this photo of this person.
[59:13] Remove all the pimples and remove all
[59:15] the wrinkles and remove all the gray
[59:17] hairs and the yellow in his teeth, make
[59:19] it white, and suck up his belly a little
[59:22] bit to get rid of that triple chin, you
[59:24] know, make him look really nice." And
[59:26] man, just in a moment, you have a photo
[59:28] AND YOU THINK, "WOW, THAT'S SUCH A WOW."
[59:31] AND YOU SEND THAT TO SOMEBODY. No one
[59:32] would know the difference that they not
[59:34] seen you. But I'm going to TELL YOU WHAT
[59:36] IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT THE REAL THING.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to TELL YOU WHAT WE HAVE
[59:41] IN THIS generation is fake Christians
[59:44] who go to church, sing the songs, get
[59:46] up, sing specials, doesn't matter.
[59:48] Listen, friends, I don't care how much,
[59:50] how gifted you are, if you're a
[59:51] preacher, if you're a song leader, if
[59:53] you're just a PEW WARMER, UNLESS YOU'VE
[59:55] GOT THE REAL THING LIVING DOWN ON THE
[59:58] INSIDE OF YOU. I JUST WANT TO SAY, GOD,
[1:00:00] I IN 2026, I WANT THE REAL THING, LORD.
[1:00:03] I want it FOR MY FAMILY, LORD. I WANT IT
[1:00:06] FOR THIS CHURCH. I WANT TO BE GENUINE
[1:00:08] PEOPLE, NOT A NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS
[1:00:11] MAN-MADE, SOMETHING THAT IS GOD MADE.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; And so the the world WOULD THE NATURAL,
[1:00:19] AS brother Random said, would tight the
[1:00:21] spiritual. How many members, brother
[1:00:22] Adam saying, that all nature runs in
[1:00:24] continuity. And so what what we find is
[1:00:27] against the Greek and the Hebrew mind is
[1:00:30] that the Hebrews knew that actually the
[1:00:32] two worlds were only separated by time
[1:00:36] or we could say speed
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; because that dimension is just moving a
[1:00:42] little bit faster than this dimension.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; And brother BRANDHAM WOULD SAY IT SO
[1:00:47] MUCH THAT WHEN you die, you don't go off
[1:00:50] a million miles. And he SAYS DEATH
[1:00:54] changes nothing except your dwelling
[1:00:57] place.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; And he says and what you are there is
[1:01:03] what you were here
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; and he says the character that's what he
[1:01:08] says there
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; and he says all that you have to take
[1:01:10] WITH YOU. SO WE NOTICE IT IN THAT other
[1:01:12] dimension that other dimension is just
[1:01:14] one step just right across the chaos.
[1:01:17] That's what brother I'm going to say.
[1:01:18] Brother man, I'm going to say just on
[1:01:19] the other side of the la of your last
[1:01:21] breath, just on the other side of this
[1:01:22] thin veil
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; is a real world with real people and
[1:01:26] real life and real atmosphere
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; and a real God.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; And so the Hebrews could understand that
[1:01:33] our God who is supernatural is spirit.
[1:01:36] He was the one who made the physical
[1:01:39] world, right?
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; And so if God created time, then God
[1:01:43] must be outside of time. How could he
[1:01:45] not be? If the creator made time and
[1:01:48] matter, then he exists outside of time
[1:01:50] and matter, right? But we being
[1:01:53] creatures of time that have been called
[1:01:55] into this little hickey, as brother
[1:01:56] Brandham calls it, this little space of
[1:01:59] time, this little aotment of time that
[1:02:01] seems like uh, you know, our entire life
[1:02:04] because that's how we view it. It's our
[1:02:06] entire existence.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; BUT TO GOD, IT'S JUST A LITTLE SPECK,
[1:02:09] just a little dot on the map.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:13] And so so brother Brandham said it would
[1:02:14] the natural and the physical would run
[1:02:16] very closely together. So that western
[1:02:19] thinking affects us to think that the
[1:02:21] physical a physical event can't have any
[1:02:23] kind of spiritual effect. That's why
[1:02:25] people have trouble fitting water
[1:02:27] baptism into salvation
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; because they can't see how a physical
[1:02:32] event can have a spiritual effect. Not
[1:02:34] saying it will, but it can.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I know that it's just to
[1:02:39] obedience, but you know, you have to be
[1:02:42] careful because you don't want to you
[1:02:45] could teach baptism in such a way that
[1:02:48] we would almost teach that as long as
[1:02:49] you've been under people could almost
[1:02:51] think that as long as they get baptized,
[1:02:52] I go under water, then that's it.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; But as as we've said many times, you can
[1:02:56] go down a dry center, come up a wet
[1:02:57] center, and there's no change in your
[1:02:59] life.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:01] But in in the same way, you don't want
[1:03:02] to just dumb it down to baptism means
[1:03:04] nothing
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; and that it doesn't have any effect.
[1:03:07] Well, that's not true. The Bible is full
[1:03:09] of the correlation between the physical
[1:03:12] and the spiritual. Let me give you just
[1:03:13] a few. Whatsoever you bind on earth, it
[1:03:18] shall be bound in heaven.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Natural, supernatural.
[1:03:23] If you say, not if you think, not if you
[1:03:27] try, but if you speak, that's why your
[1:03:30] words have value, NOT EVEN PRAY. BUT
[1:03:33] JESUS SAID, IF you speak to if you say
[1:03:36] to this mountain,
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; be thou removed and cast into the sea.
[1:03:40] Why did non have to dip one time, two
[1:03:43] times, three times, four times, five
[1:03:45] times to be healed of his leprosy?
[1:03:47] Because there was a connection between
[1:03:50] the physical Amen.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; And the non-physical.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; I don't want to lose you here because
[1:03:56] it's very important.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; This is why we believe it's important to
[1:04:02] come to church.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Not stream.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; But come to church. This is why brother
[1:04:10] Brandon would even say and make comments
[1:04:12] along this and I don't have the quotes
[1:04:13] here before me that he says you he this
[1:04:17] is why we teach so many times that the
[1:04:19] anointing of God flows from the platform
[1:04:22] down to the people.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; That's why you ought to sit up closer to
[1:04:26] the front.
[1:04:28] Now, you laugh at that, but I'll show
[1:04:30] you a quote where brother Brandham is
[1:04:31] talking about the balcony and he says,
[1:04:33] "You know, not one time have I ever
[1:04:35] watched this the he says,"The spirit of
[1:04:37] God, the angel of the Lord up here on
[1:04:39] the platform. I've watched it go to
[1:04:40] person on this row, that row, that row."
[1:04:42] He said, "I've never seen it go all the
[1:04:43] way to the balcony."
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Now, you just think about that for a
[1:04:47] moment.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; You might sit in a different seat next
[1:04:50] next Sunday.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; You stay in the sound booth now. We need
[1:04:54] you up there. Okay? Amen.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; And so the natural types, the spiritual,
[1:04:59] it's a very simple point, but it's
[1:05:00] profound that that that brother BRANDHAM
[1:05:03] WOULD SAY TO HADTIE, RIGHT? YOU KNOW,
[1:05:04] when she's sitting there, he's talking
[1:05:06] about Jehovah Gyron. And and brother
[1:05:08] Brandham's talking about, you know, Mark
[1:05:10] uh can't recall the scripture right now
[1:05:12] that greater work shall you do for I go
[1:05:14] unto the father. And brother Brandham's
[1:05:15] talking about Jehovah Gyron, the
[1:05:16] squirrels. And he says, "Hatty, you
[1:05:18] know," he says, "I don't know other what
[1:05:20] it was, Sister Haddie, other than than
[1:05:21] Jehov the same Jehovah Gyra." And sister
[1:05:24] Hadtie said, "Amen, brother Brandon.
[1:05:26] That's nothing but the truth." And when
[1:05:28] she spoke the right words, she said the
[1:05:31] right words.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon, you know, I could give
[1:05:35] you example after example. When Jesus
[1:05:38] and you know, goes to heal the blind
[1:05:40] person, you know, he he he spit on the
[1:05:43] dirt, he made clay, he rubbed it into
[1:05:46] Why do you go through ALL OF THIS? WHY
[1:05:48] NOT JUST SPEAK? HERE'S the Lord. HERE'S
[1:05:50] THE SON OF GOD, THE GIFT of God. But he
[1:05:53] goes through all of the PROCESS OF
[1:05:55] SPITTING ON THE GROUND, TAKING THE MUD,
[1:05:58] PUTTING IT ON THE man m on THE MAN'S
[1:06:00] EYES. WHAT ABOUT THE MAN? HE TELLS HIM
[1:06:01] TO GO TO THE POOL OF SILOMME and wash
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; the blind man.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Because there was a evidence that the
[1:06:10] natural types the spiritual.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; So in other words, what you do naturally
[1:06:17] is very important. This is why we don't
[1:06:21] just repeat a sinner's prayer. This is
[1:06:24] why we don't just have a mental
[1:06:27] agreement. It's wonderful to ra, you
[1:06:29] know, to, you know, to raise your hands
[1:06:31] to the word of God, but there's got to
[1:06:32] be something more than just even
[1:06:34] something that you do physically. It's
[1:06:36] got to move something into an unseen
[1:06:39] realm spiritually. Yes,
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; I want to move through through through
[1:06:44] this, you know, because we we we got I
[1:06:46] got so much to cover that I I don't want
[1:06:48] to get bogged down uh here with some of
[1:06:51] this. So, you help me uh just pray for
[1:06:53] me tonight that I can just be uh
[1:06:56] sensitive to where the Lord where the
[1:06:57] Lord wants me to go and what we'll save
[1:06:59] for next time. So, baptism is an event
[1:07:02] that can have a spiritual effect. So you
[1:07:05] can see, you can begin to see how the
[1:07:07] Hebrew thinking of how burying,
[1:07:11] that's what we call it, burying someone
[1:07:13] and washing someone in a bath of water
[1:07:15] can clean them on the inside. It can
[1:07:18] wash their conscience. It can give them
[1:07:21] a fresh start.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; It could give them a clean slate. That's
[1:07:25] why we do it. That's why we believe in
[1:07:27] it. That's why we serve communion,
[1:07:29] another ordinance. It's why we have foot
[1:07:31] washing.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can make a, you know, I I I I
[1:07:36] don't want to make light of that at all
[1:07:37] because I I believe that God instituted
[1:07:40] these things into the church because
[1:07:42] they were REAL PHYSICAL things
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; that we have to do to be obedient to
[1:07:49] God.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; As brother Brandham says, we'll do these
[1:07:52] things. Jesus said that do this as often
[1:07:54] until I come in remembrance of me.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; And so we take communion. We search our
[1:08:00] lives. It ought not to be taken. We just
[1:08:02] took it. it ought not to be taken
[1:08:04] lightly.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; And and and and I think sometimes that's
[1:08:08] what what what we need is is because
[1:08:11] it's amazing because that that time when
[1:08:14] you know that you're about to take the
[1:08:15] Lord's supper and you're searching your
[1:08:17] life and you're turning over every stone
[1:08:19] and you're repenting of your sins and
[1:08:21] you're asking God to clean you, asking
[1:08:23] God to take anything that's you're
[1:08:25] you're surveying, you're taking
[1:08:27] inventory because that's what Jesus was
[1:08:29] teaching them.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. And he says, "Let a man
[1:08:33] examine himself."
[1:08:36] And so, let him look at his life. Let
[1:08:38] him look at HIS DESIRES. LET HIM LOOK at
[1:08:41] his ambitions. Let him look at his
[1:08:43] habits. Because out of those THINGS OF
[1:08:46] YOUR LIFE WILL TELL YOU. YOU DON'T NEED
[1:08:48] A PREACHER TO TELL YOU. You don't need a
[1:08:50] vision from God to tell you. Look at
[1:08:52] your life. It'll tell you whether you
[1:08:55] have the real thing or you don't.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; I said, "Look at your life. It'll tell
[1:09:00] you whether you have the real thing or
[1:09:02] you don't.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; You got you you that you know it's very
[1:09:08] very very very simple. We make it
[1:09:09] sometimes so complicated but it's really
[1:09:11] not.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; You know I'm just going to stop here
[1:09:15] just for a moment. I just want to say
[1:09:17] some of these things because you know
[1:09:19] let me just say let me give you seven
[1:09:21] let me just give you seven things. We
[1:09:23] always talk about evidence of being born
[1:09:24] again. Let me give you seven signs that
[1:09:27] you're not born again. Can I do that? Is
[1:09:29] that okay? Amen.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Because many people assume salvation
[1:09:33] because of baptism
[1:09:36] or a prayer or a church membership as
[1:09:39] brother Brandham said. They shake the
[1:09:42] preacher's hands and they they they put
[1:09:45] their name on a book. And brother said
[1:09:47] that'll make you no more a Christian.
[1:09:49] And he says then then then then anything
[1:09:51] doesn't matter how many churches how the
[1:09:53] church that you've joined who your
[1:09:54] pastor is because a true new birth a
[1:09:57] true the real thing IS NOT ABOUT A
[1:10:00] MOMENT. LET ME SAY IT THIS WAY. IT'S NOT
[1:10:02] A MOMENT IT'S A MIRACLE.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; It's actually a miracle that happens in
[1:10:09] your soul.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; WE BELIEVE IN THE MIRACLE for the body.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; We believe in healing FOR THE BODY.
[1:10:15] WELL, THIS IS A MIRACLE THAT TAKES PLACE
[1:10:18] THAT HEALS YOUR SOUL.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; And so the evidence of transformation,
[1:10:25] not reformation, but the evidence of
[1:10:28] transformation must be present.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Must be.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to slow down because now
[1:10:35] I'm coming to the real thing that the
[1:10:37] Lord put upon my heart. And so
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; I almost I almost just felt led to
[1:10:45] um
[1:10:47] in some ways just to read this, but I
[1:10:49] won't.
[1:10:51] I want to give you seven signs that
[1:10:53] you're not born again
[1:10:56] because I believe that the utmost
[1:10:59] important thing in our lives is that we
[1:11:03] have the real true new birth.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. there could actually be nothing
[1:11:09] more important than I could teach my
[1:11:11] kids, nothing more important than I
[1:11:12] could teach uh uh uh you know my family.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; So you say, "What is what is an
[1:11:19] evidence?" I'll tell you one evidence
[1:11:20] that you've that you might have had a
[1:11:22] work of the Holy Ghost, but you've never
[1:11:23] truly been born again. There's no hunger
[1:11:26] for the word. Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; I want these just to sink in here for a
[1:11:31] moment as they did me because the Bible
[1:11:34] says in 1 Peter 2:2, can you turn to
[1:11:36] these Gideon just quickly as you as I
[1:11:38] read some of these? I want to read them
[1:11:40] together. 1 Peter chapter 2 and uh
[1:11:48] I'll just pull them up also here just so
[1:11:50] that we can make sure we have them. I'm
[1:11:53] going to read them quickly. But 1 Peter
[1:11:55] 2:2 talks about a newborn baby. As
[1:11:59] newborn babes desire the sincere milk of
[1:12:04] the experience,
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; speaking in tongues, shouting, dancing,
[1:12:10] jumping.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:13] As newborn babes desire the sincere milk
[1:12:18] of church,
[1:12:20] youth groups, youth camps,
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; this is what a true the real thing looks
[1:12:28] like.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; You desire the sincere milk of the word
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; that you may grow thereby.
[1:12:39] So a true believer, a true experience
[1:12:43] craves the word.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; I I you know I I I I I just want to say
[1:12:50] that you know can I just suggest maybe
[1:12:52] just possibly
[1:12:55] can I can I just suggest this and I want
[1:12:56] to be careful how I say this. Can I
[1:12:58] suggest that sometimes we need a revival
[1:13:01] of reading our Bible
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; that I believe that that that we need to
[1:13:07] get back to this book
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; cuz I believe this is a lifechanging
[1:13:12] book
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; and I'll just go ahead and you give
[1:13:14] brother Matt's opinion. This is brother
[1:13:16] 2026 opinions of brother Matt. They
[1:13:18] might change in 2027 but this is mine.
[1:13:21] You can take it or leave it. I don't I I
[1:13:23] I I would I I don't believe that reading
[1:13:25] the Bible I believe if you've got a
[1:13:27] phone that's a good thing. You read the
[1:13:28] Bible from your phone, that's a good
[1:13:30] thing,
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; but that is not the same as reading it
[1:13:32] from this book.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Now, that's my opinion. Take it or leave
[1:13:36] it.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; But I believe that your phone serves
[1:13:40] many purposes.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; It's a phone. It's a texting device.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; It's a check my social media device.
[1:13:47] It's a check my email device. It's a
[1:13:49] check my work schedule device. It's a
[1:13:51] check the score in the game device.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; It's a check their location device. It's
[1:13:57] a what did I miss device. But I tell you
[1:14:00] what this is. This doesn't have a check
[1:14:02] my text device or check the score
[1:14:04] device. This is a mirror
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; that I get to look at my soul
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; and ask my ask myself the question,
[1:14:13] where am I? Where where do I stand? Am I
[1:14:16] in the faith? Amen.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; So when you read the word from this
[1:14:20] physical book, it's very different than
[1:14:22] reading it from your phone.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; We ought to get back in our churches to
[1:14:25] where when the preacher opens his Bible,
[1:14:28] everyone opens a Bible with him.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, you tuned me out. It's all
[1:14:35] right. We'll keep going.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; I believe it'll do you some good. Can I
[1:14:39] just be honest with you? I need a fresh
[1:14:41] revival of this.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; So I'm not preaching at you. I'm preach
[1:14:45] and write it myself. I believe this is
[1:14:47] the only Listen friends, this is not a
[1:14:49] novel. It's not a history. It has lots
[1:14:52] of good history in it. Could be one of
[1:14:53] the greatest novels ever. But this is
[1:14:55] the Bible says this is the spirit of
[1:14:57] wisdom.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; So you want wisdom? Wisdom is knowledge
[1:15:01] is something you gain. Wisdom is a gift.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; And this is the only thing that'll give
[1:15:06] you real wisdom.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; So a newborn baby, can we get back to
[1:15:12] it? craves the word.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; You lay in the word. NOT JUST PREACHERS.
[1:15:17] THAT'S WHY YOU'RE listening to God's
[1:15:18] prophet. That's why you're in your
[1:15:20] Bible. That's why you're reading the
[1:15:21] word of God. That's why you're doing
[1:15:23] that. Because you're craving it.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO BE CORRECTED. YOU WANT TO BE
[1:15:29] CHASTISED. YOU WANT TO BE CHALLENGED.
[1:15:31] Come on. DO I HAVE ANY CHRISTIANS HERE?
[1:15:33] YOU WANT TO BE RENEWED. YOU WANT TO BE
[1:15:35] RESTORED. YOU WANT ANSWERS TO YOUR
[1:15:36] QUESTIONS. YOU WANT TO KNOW THE WILL OF
[1:15:38] GOD. YOU WANT TO YOU WANT YOU WANT
[1:15:40] PROBLEMS SOLVED. YOU WANT THE REAL
[1:15:42] THING. THIS IS WHERE YOU GET IT FROM.
[1:15:45] From feeding on the word.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Let me just say it this way. IF THERE IS
[1:15:50] NO HUNGER, THEN THERE IS NO LIFE.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Because there is no baby that is born
[1:15:59] that is alive that doesn't hunger.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Tell you another sign that you're not
[1:16:07] born again. You're comfortable living
[1:16:09] with sin.
[1:16:12] 1 John 3:9. Can you turn there with me?
[1:16:14] I hear Bibles maybe a little bit now.
[1:16:17] First John 1 John 3, chapter 3, verse 9.
[1:16:22] Uh, some of you don't even know how to
[1:16:23] get there in your Bible.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; First John, come on. Go right past
[1:16:28] James,
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; right past Peter. Keep going till you
[1:16:32] get to First John. Listen to this here.
[1:16:34] 1 John chapter 3. Let's just begin
[1:16:37] reading. Whosoever is born, someone say
[1:16:40] this with me, born. Whosoever is born of
[1:16:43] God, doth not commit sin, for his seed
[1:16:49] remainth in him, and he cannot sin
[1:16:53] because he is born
[1:16:56] of God.
[1:16:58] So, one of the evidences and I'm saying
[1:17:00] not not that a believer or a person
[1:17:02] who's really born again can't stumble.
[1:17:04] You will stumble. You will have
[1:17:05] mistakes, but you can't make peace with
[1:17:08] that stumbling.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; There will be something in your life
[1:17:12] that repels that part of you
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; in so much. Not just that you're a lot
[1:17:18] because a lot was a was a borderline
[1:17:20] believer
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; who was vexed by sin. There's a
[1:17:23] difference in being vexed by sin in your
[1:17:25] life. Brother Brandham says he was vexed
[1:17:27] by it, but he he didn't have the plain
[1:17:30] backbone to do anything about it.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. A true new birth won't let you
[1:17:35] stay in the vexed stage.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; It'll take you to the extermination
[1:17:40] phase to where you annihilate that sin
[1:17:43] in your life.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; And indifference towards sin is a
[1:17:47] terrifying sign that there's no spirit
[1:17:52] within
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; because grace doesn't give permission to
[1:17:55] sin. Grace gives you power to overcome
[1:17:58] sin.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Titus chapter 2 verse 11. Titus chapter
[1:18:02] 2. I'm going to wait on these. I feel
[1:18:04] like it's good to read them. Titus
[1:18:06] chapter 2 and we'll just read from verse
[1:18:08] 11 and also verse 12. You have that
[1:18:11] Gideon. For the grace of God that
[1:18:13] bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
[1:18:16] men. Verse 12, teaching us that denying
[1:18:20] ungodliness and worldly lives, we should
[1:18:23] live soberly, righteously, and godly in
[1:18:26] this present world. So true grace
[1:18:30] teaches us to deny ungodliness. Can you
[1:18:33] say amen?
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; I'll give you another sign that you're
[1:18:36] never have never truly been born again
[1:18:39] or that you don't have the real thing.
[1:18:42] Spiritual fruit, this is a tough one, is
[1:18:46] absent in your life.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; The fruit of the spirit. Galatians 5 22.
[1:18:53] Let's read it together. Galatians 5
[1:18:56] verse 22. You love the word.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad you do. I'm glad these
[1:19:01] aren't my words. These are the Lord's.
[1:19:03] But the fruit of the spirit is love,
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; joy, peace,
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
[1:19:12] faith, meekness, temperance.
[1:19:16] So, YOU SAY, "BROTHER M, DOES THAT mean
[1:19:18] that IF I'M NOT ALWAYS MEEK, I'm not
[1:19:19] born?" That's not what I'm saying at
[1:19:21] all. I'm saying that if none of these
[1:19:23] fruits are a part of your desire that
[1:19:26] you're craving and and thirsting and
[1:19:28] saying, "God, express yourself through
[1:19:31] love, through temperance, through
[1:19:32] meekness, through gentleness, through
[1:19:34] joy, through peace, through
[1:19:35] longsuffering."
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; If none of those are bearing fruit from
[1:19:40] your life, it's an evidence there's no
[1:19:43] life there.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; You can't take You can You can fake, let
[1:19:47] me say it this way, gifts. You can You
[1:19:49] can fake a gift. You can't fake real
[1:19:52] true the true nature of Jesus.
[1:19:57] Let me give you another sign. The love
[1:19:59] for the world over the love of God. This
[1:20:02] is one we know very well. 1 John chapter
[1:20:04] 2:15. 1 John 2 and verse 15. I love
[1:20:09] this. We know it very well. Someone read
[1:20:12] this with me. Love not the world,
[1:20:15] neither the things of the world. If any
[1:20:19] man love the world, the love of the
[1:20:21] father
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; is is not in him.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; This is as clear as it gets to me.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; The love of the father, love not the
[1:20:33] world, nor the things of the in the
[1:20:35] world. If any man love the world, the
[1:20:37] love of the father is not in him.
[1:20:43] So, friendship of the world, James 4:4,
[1:20:46] is enmity with God.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Let me just say it TO MAKE IT CLEAR. A
[1:20:51] real true new birth will never let you
[1:20:54] comfortable, make you comfortable.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; And have a place of comfort to where
[1:20:59] you're just happy to be here and you're
[1:21:01] ready just to kick it up, you know, you
[1:21:03] just kick your feet up and, you know,
[1:21:04] forget the rapture, forget heaven, man.
[1:21:06] I just rather just prolong this life as
[1:21:08] long as I can.
[1:21:12] A true believer feels out of place in
[1:21:14] this world. Can you say amen?
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; I'll give you just another real simple,
[1:21:18] these are all real simple right out of
[1:21:19] the Bible. Another sign of no life is
[1:21:22] that there's no real transformation of
[1:21:25] life. 2 Corinthians 5:1 17 and I have it
[1:21:30] here if you can just pull it up quickly.
[1:21:32] Gideon 2 Corinthians chapter 5:1 17.
[1:21:34] Let's read it together. Therefore, if
[1:21:37] any man be in I can't hear hear you. He
[1:21:40] is a new creature. Old things are passed
[1:21:44] away. Behold, all things are become new.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; So salvation, true change, the real
[1:21:55] thing brings visible visible visible
[1:22:00] token on display.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Old habits are broken. New desires are
[1:22:08] formed inside of that newborn baby. It's
[1:22:12] not perfection that I'm talking about.
[1:22:14] You say, "Brother Matt, I'm not you
[1:22:14] talking about perfection. I'm not
[1:22:15] talking about perfection. I'm talking
[1:22:17] about progression.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about not letting yourself
[1:22:20] stay the way that you are, but you're
[1:22:23] moving on to something to be transformed
[1:22:26] by the renewing of your mind." Is that
[1:22:29] what the Bible says? To be transformed
[1:22:31] by the renewing of the mind. because
[1:22:34] guilt or emotion. Let me just say this.
[1:22:36] It's wonderful to have guilt over sin
[1:22:38] and then you get emotional over that
[1:22:40] guilt. But but you can get emotional
[1:22:42] under the right preaching. Someone
[1:22:43] that's why brother Brandham says we
[1:22:45] don't believe in that beating someone on
[1:22:46] the back and you know mama going up
[1:22:48] there to the altar. That's all
[1:22:50] wonderful. But friends, for a real true
[1:22:52] new birth, it's something that happens
[1:22:54] outside of mama, daddy, what preacher
[1:22:57] says, it's something that strikes your
[1:22:59] soul. It's something that comes inside
[1:23:01] of you to where you're so sick and tired
[1:23:03] of yourself and your old ways and you
[1:23:06] want to die to yourself and your passion
[1:23:08] and your pride. You don't want to be you
[1:23:10] anymore. You you don't want to be the
[1:23:13] old self. You want to crucify who's ever
[1:23:16] in Christ is a new creation in Christ.
[1:23:18] AND I JUST SAY EVERY DAY, LORD, LET THE
[1:23:20] OLD MAN DIE. LET THE OLD HABITS DIE. LET
[1:23:23] THE OLD DESIRES DIE. I WANT TO HAVE A
[1:23:25] NEW h a new life. GIVE ME A NEW HABIT. A
[1:23:28] HABIT OF READING MY BIBLE. A HABIT OF
[1:23:30] PRAYING TO GOD. A HABIT OF COMING TO
[1:23:32] CHURCH.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; SO, IT'S NOT PERFECTION. It's
[1:23:36] progression. A baby that has life grows,
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; matures.
[1:23:43] It grows. Philippians 1:16, he that hath
[1:23:46] begun a good work in you will complete
[1:23:49] it. Can you say amen?
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so th those were just seven
[1:23:54] just very quick, very simple, very
[1:23:57] basic, which is just the way I wanted it
[1:23:59] to be, the way the Lord put it upon my
[1:24:01] heart. You see, because true
[1:24:03] justification by faith is one of the
[1:24:07] foundational truths that we hold true.
[1:24:10] Not just the evidence or the baptism of
[1:24:12] the Holy Ghost, but there's got to be a
[1:24:14] state that you come to to where you are
[1:24:16] justified,
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; sanctified.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll never you'll never get to
[1:24:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the real
[1:24:24] thing, if you're never truly justified.
[1:24:26] Can I just slow down here for a moment?
[1:24:28] You can't even know true peace
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; and true rest until you are convinced
[1:24:34] that you could never be made right in
[1:24:36] the eyes of God by your own works. Amen.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; You will live in a constant state of
[1:24:43] toil and torment where the devil is
[1:24:47] always beating you up over your mistakes
[1:24:49] until you are justified. Listen, that's
[1:24:51] brother Brandham says that's that's the
[1:24:53] what is that? That's the That's not the
[1:24:55] judge looking at you and saying you were
[1:24:58] guilty. I know you murdered the man. You
[1:25:00] were guilty, but I'm going to choose to
[1:25:01] pardon you. That's wonderful. But he
[1:25:03] says real justification is when the
[1:25:05] judge says you were never guilty in the
[1:25:07] first place. You were trapped into it.
[1:25:10] You're not a murderer. That's not your
[1:25:12] identity. And you don't live with the
[1:25:13] conscious of that guilt. The worshipper
[1:25:16] once purged is free from the
[1:25:17] consciousness of sin.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; So if you don't understand that the
[1:25:21] perfect righteousness of JESUS IS YOURS
[1:25:25] BY FAITH,
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; you'll lead a life of toil, sweat, spend
[1:25:30] your days trying to please God through
[1:25:32] outward works. And good works. And good
[1:25:34] works are good works. They're just that.
[1:25:36] It's good that you do them, but they
[1:25:37] won't save you.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Not at all. Let me say it this way. God
[1:25:42] wants our righteous works.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Don't ever mistake that and say, "Our
[1:25:46] works are filthy righteousness, so we
[1:25:48] ought to not have works." That's a
[1:25:49] misinterpretation of the scripture.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; God wants your holy, righteous works,
[1:25:54] but they alone won't save you.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; But if you've really been saved, you'll
[1:25:58] produce. That's what James was saying.
[1:26:00] You'll produce real works. If there's a
[1:26:03] real saving faith, that saving faith
[1:26:05] will produce works in your life. And so
[1:26:08] this this God doesn't despise good
[1:26:11] works. He wants our righteous works. But
[1:26:14] if you think your good works is what
[1:26:16] allows you to merit salvation,
[1:26:20] I I just wish I could teach this so so I
[1:26:23] hope this is so clear.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, young people. Listen to me
[1:26:30] because this question gets asked so
[1:26:32] much. You hear all these phrases
[1:26:34] sometimes. I I just wonder sometimes if
[1:26:36] it's like a blur. You hear it so much in
[1:26:39] the Holy Ghost and new birth and the
[1:26:40] real thing and justification say and you
[1:26:43] know you can almost get to the point to
[1:26:44] where you just sort of tune those things
[1:26:46] out
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; and and then church is just becomes a
[1:26:50] ritual and a cycle that you that you go
[1:26:52] through.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; I think we've lost a lot of people that
[1:26:56] way.
[1:26:57] We lost a lot of people who sat in
[1:26:59] churches, sat there for years hearing
[1:27:01] good preaching, preaching under the word
[1:27:03] of God, preach, you know, good teaching,
[1:27:05] solid, grounded,
[1:27:08] but were just tuned out.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Never really engaged.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Never really that moment to where you're
[1:27:16] you're you're making your calling an
[1:27:18] election sure.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; So, let me just in in in saying that,
[1:27:24] let me just slow down here for a moment.
[1:27:28] Because if you think good works merits
[1:27:30] your salvation, that they somehow allow
[1:27:33] you to stand holy because you've done a
[1:27:35] holy thing. As as God says, I think it's
[1:27:38] in Isaiah, that your righteousness is as
[1:27:41] filthy rags.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Filthy rags. A stench
[1:27:46] in my nostril.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; And And you know what? That we feel
[1:27:49] good. I'll just be honest with you. We
[1:27:51] feel good when we do good things.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:56] We feel good. You know, you you you get
[1:27:58] this moment of victory that, you know, I
[1:28:00] you know, I've resisted temptation and I
[1:28:02] resisted that thing and I feel good
[1:28:04] about myself, you know, and I didn't do
[1:28:06] it. I didn't fall. I didn't give into
[1:28:08] this and you know, I did the right thing
[1:28:09] and I could have thrown my temper, but I
[1:28:11] didn't do it. And
[1:28:16] must be a good Christian. There's
[1:28:18] probably days when you think you've
[1:28:19] overcome. Man, I've really overcome. And
[1:28:21] I'm a real overcomer. You know, I that
[1:28:23] little thing that always snag me up and
[1:28:25] always gets me. And you know, for a
[1:28:26] moment you feel I think God sometimes
[1:28:28] does that just for a moment you feel
[1:28:29] righteous.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; God's favor's upon me. I must be going
[1:28:34] the right direction. You know, the
[1:28:36] problem is that you're setting yourself
[1:28:38] up
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; if you think it had anything to do with
[1:28:41] you.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Because then the next day when you fail,
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; You know, your your faith is
[1:28:47] shipwrecked. Yeah,
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; you fall back into it and then suddenly
[1:28:50] your joy is linked and your praise is
[1:28:53] linked and now we link our salvation to
[1:28:55] whether we make a mistake or not.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; See how the devil attaches that and then
[1:29:00] he keeps a person in a constant cycle of
[1:29:03] beating you up, you know, over things.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; And and and this is exactly what sin
[1:29:11] does. It's causes you to begin to hide
[1:29:13] from God.
[1:29:15] This is what sin did in the garden. It
[1:29:17] caused man to hide from God. Adam, Adam,
[1:29:20] where aren't you? I was afraid, so I hid
[1:29:23] myself. It's what David did when David
[1:29:25] fell in sin with Ba Sheeba. What started
[1:29:28] in secret and he kept it a secret and he
[1:29:30] allowed to nurture that sin. And that
[1:29:33] sin became more than a thought. It
[1:29:35] turned from a thought into a deed, an
[1:29:36] action.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; And then it gets worse cuz sin always
[1:29:39] gets worse.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Sin is like a snowball going down the
[1:29:43] mountain. It just gets bigger and bigger
[1:29:44] and bigger and bigger. And before you
[1:29:46] know it, David's not only fallen out of
[1:29:48] in sin with Bath Sheba, now he murders
[1:29:50] the her husband, has him killed, covers
[1:29:52] the whole thing up. It's a big secret.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; And and then tries to live in that lie.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; And he says later, is it Psalms 56? And
[1:30:04] he's starting to say, I you know, when I
[1:30:06] was silent about my sin, my bones achd.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; He says they achd all night long.
[1:30:14] And it it started to affect him. He
[1:30:16] couldn't sleep and he was living with
[1:30:17] that thing
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; and and then it snowballs from that and
[1:30:21] then they have a baby and then the whole
[1:30:23] thing the whole cover up and here comes
[1:30:25] the prophet and he gives the story about
[1:30:27] the lamb and you know the rich man you
[1:30:30] know you know took of the poor man's
[1:30:33] lamb and and and he says he loved that
[1:30:35] lamb who he loved and he nurtured and he
[1:30:37] raised and drank ate at his table. This
[1:30:39] is what Samuel is saying to David. That
[1:30:42] lamb was precious to him. He's talking
[1:30:44] about Uriah and he's and he's and he's,
[1:30:47] you know, he took of the poor man's lamb
[1:30:49] and didn't take of his own, but took of
[1:30:50] the poor man's lamb instead instead. And
[1:30:53] David in his self-righteousness.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Amen.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; It's amazing how sin is so can hide
[1:31:01] itself so much that he's HE'S LIVING IN
[1:31:04] OUTRIGHT SIN. HE'S LIVING IN OUTRIGHT
[1:31:07] ADULTERY.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; AND YET HE'S A CHRISTIAN. Yet he's a
[1:31:10] believer. YET HE'S HE'S GOING TO GET
[1:31:11] INDIGNANT.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE SOMETIMES SIN CAN SO
[1:31:17] DESENSITIZE A PERSON TO WHERE THEY
[1:31:19] THERE'S so many layers and there's just
[1:31:21] layers upon layers of religion AND
[1:31:24] CHRISTIANITY AND REPUTATION AND PEOPLE
[1:31:27] AND FRIENDS. CAN I JUST SAY I JUST FEEL
[1:31:29] I FEEL THE UNCCTION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[1:31:31] I'D RATHER BE A A DRUNK. I'D RATHER BE A
[1:31:34] SINNER ON ON THE STREET KNOWING THAT'S
[1:31:36] WHO I AM AND EVERYBODY KNOWING WHO THAT
[1:31:38] THAT'S WHO I AM THAN TO BE A A PERSON
[1:31:40] WHO NAMES THE NAME OF CHRIST AND AND
[1:31:43] SAYS I'm a Christian but living a
[1:31:45] SEPARATE LIFE AS THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID
[1:31:47] LET ME DIE LET ME DIE A SINNER BUT NOT A
[1:31:50] HYPOCRITE. DON'T EVER LET ME STAND
[1:31:52] BEFORE GOD. LET ME BE WHO I AM AND SAY
[1:31:56] GOD THIS IS THE REAL ME AND I need the
[1:31:58] real thing. THIS IS THE REAL PERSON AND
[1:32:01] I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A DISGUISE OR A
[1:32:03] MASK ANYMORE. I WANT TO TAKE MY MASK OFF
[1:32:06] AND SAY, "GOD, I'M A SINNER. I I I need
[1:32:09] salvation. I need the real THING IN MY
[1:32:11] LIFE." OH, GOD. THAT'S THE KIND OF MAN
[1:32:13] GOD can fill with the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; But help us to be real.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; OH, HOW MANY WANT THAT WITH ME? Let me
[1:32:21] be real, Lord.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Let me be who I really am, not a fake.
[1:32:26] AMEN.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; GOD CAN'T EVEN DEAL WITH THE FAKE.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Be who you are.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; David gets MAD AND ANGRY. LET THIS MAN,
[1:32:37] THE MAN WHO HAS DONE THIS THING, he
[1:32:40] shall surely die.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; And Samuel says, "You are the man."
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Now, I didn't tell you where a real
[1:32:48] Christian stands. That David could have
[1:32:50] got mad. How dare you, Samuel. You could
[1:32:54] have waited till we were in the back
[1:32:55] room in the back office. You did it
[1:32:57] right out here in church and everybody
[1:32:59] was watching and everybody was
[1:33:00] listening.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; How dare you expose me? That's not what
[1:33:04] a true a real Christian does.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; A real believer
[1:33:09] a real believer begins to repent. And
[1:33:12] the Bible says that David after he was
[1:33:14] confronted with Samuel fell to his face.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Begin to call out to God.
[1:33:24] this this justification. I'm getting God
[1:33:27] 48 minutes. I've got 12 left. You just
[1:33:29] stay with me.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; You love them. You love the Lord.
[1:33:34] And he says, you may this is this is
[1:33:36] this is really, you know, because this
[1:33:38] is where we get to to where it's a
[1:33:39] roller coaster ride of emotional highs
[1:33:41] and emotional lows and you think the
[1:33:44] Lord's angry with you. And
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; you know, I I I I I got to that place. I
[1:33:50] was even even witnessing this is back
[1:33:52] here some number of months ago right
[1:33:54] before youth camp and I was I was going
[1:33:57] to baptize and and marry a couple and
[1:34:00] I'm just you know they they wanted to be
[1:34:02] baptized and I just I sat down with them
[1:34:04] and I here's what my whole message to
[1:34:06] them was. said, "Before we baptize,
[1:34:08] before we take you to the water, it's a
[1:34:10] wonderful thing. You're wanting to be
[1:34:12] baptized. Start your, you know, I asked
[1:34:15] him, why do you want to be why are you
[1:34:17] wanting to be baptized? What's your
[1:34:19] what's your reason?" Well, had a
[1:34:21] wonderful, wonderful desire. Real
[1:34:23] sincere said, "We've we've done things
[1:34:26] the wrong way up to this point. We're
[1:34:28] about to get married. We want to do
[1:34:30] things the right way. We want to start
[1:34:32] the right way." What a noble desire.
[1:34:36] And I'll never forget sitting there in
[1:34:38] that living room with them and I told
[1:34:39] him, I said, 'You know, here's what I
[1:34:41] here's where here's where my heart is. I
[1:34:44] so bad don't want you to be
[1:34:46] disappointed. I said, disappointed?
[1:34:49] That's probably what they were thinking.
[1:34:51] I said, because so many times people can
[1:34:55] have such an expectation
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; that it's just a one time I get
[1:35:00] baptized, go in the water, pray a
[1:35:02] prayer, come up to an altar. Come on,
[1:35:04] friends. We're a lot of times we're no
[1:35:06] different.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; You know, just that one time we we're
[1:35:08] going to go to this certain meeting,
[1:35:09] this certain preacher and going to feel
[1:35:11] this certain moment and that's going to
[1:35:12] settle it all. And then what you find is
[1:35:15] because there is no real change. There's
[1:35:19] no growth. There's no craving of the
[1:35:21] word. There's no there's no real true uh
[1:35:25] um if I could say real true honesty with
[1:35:29] self. and it's just all about a moment
[1:35:32] or something they can do. I said, so
[1:35:35] many people start off that way and think
[1:35:36] it's all over and then the battle really
[1:35:39] begins
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; and then they leave because they're they
[1:35:43] leave disappointed
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; cuz they didn't get the real thing.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; And they they they they go on this
[1:35:51] endless roller coaster. And I told him,
[1:35:53] I said, "I I want to make sure that we
[1:35:55] do this right because unless your
[1:35:57] baptism is started with real repentance,
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; and I just talked to them for probably
[1:36:03] 30 minutes about what it really means to
[1:36:05] repent, what it really means, not just
[1:36:08] even a prayer that you pray, but when
[1:36:10] you really face yourself for who you
[1:36:13] really are, that in you there is no good
[1:36:15] thing. and you don't want to be you you
[1:36:18] you're you're not looking for anything
[1:36:20] that you can do other than admit and
[1:36:23] come to a real honest confession
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; to say, "Lord, I am I am I have been
[1:36:30] wrong. I am wrong. There's nothing about
[1:36:32] me good and I'm sick of sin. Not the
[1:36:35] effects of sin, but I'm tired of sin.
[1:36:37] I'm tired of pleasure. I I don't just
[1:36:40] WANT TO BE A I LISTEN. GOD DIDN'T JUST
[1:36:42] COME TO take us to heaven. But he he
[1:36:44] came to even while we're here on earth
[1:36:46] to deliver us from this present world.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; This is really what I'm preaching to you
[1:36:51] on that the real thing delivers you from
[1:36:54] this present world.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Because if not, it's a roller coaster of
[1:36:59] up and down and hot and cold and sin and
[1:37:01] confess and sin and confess and repent
[1:37:03] according to how everything's based upon
[1:37:04] how good or how bad or how good your
[1:37:06] track record is. And maybe on a
[1:37:08] particular day you're doing good, but on
[1:37:09] another day you're doing bad. You're up
[1:37:11] one day you're down another day.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; But when we turn to the Lord, can I say
[1:37:21] with real true saving faith is a faith
[1:37:24] that is you turn to the Lord and you
[1:37:26] empty out yourself.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; You empty out. You become one with the
[1:37:33] Lord.
[1:37:34] And and that and that in and of itself
[1:37:37] is what credits you because the
[1:37:39] righteousness of Jesus, as brother
[1:37:41] Brandham said, is credited to your
[1:37:43] account.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; All your sins are washed away because of
[1:37:49] his work, not our work.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; And we're one, as the Bible says, JOINT
[1:37:54] HES. AND NOT ONLY ARE WE ONE IN JESUS,
[1:37:57] can I say we are complete in Jesus.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, can I get a Christian to help me
[1:38:01] preach? Because at the cross, our old
[1:38:04] man was crucified with its fleshly
[1:38:06] desires and its fleshly lust and all of
[1:38:09] its self-righteousness and all of its
[1:38:11] striving and all of its toiling. IT WAS
[1:38:13] ALL DONE AWAY WITH IN GOD'S EYES WHEN
[1:38:16] GOD SAID ON THE CROSS, "IT IS FINISHED."
[1:38:18] HE WAS SAYING, "YOUR WORK IS FINISHED.
[1:38:20] YOUR TOIL IS FINISHED."
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; And now you can stand before me as a
[1:38:26] righteous, perfect, righteous man in
[1:38:28] Jesus.
[1:38:31] Because all who are in him are forgiven.
[1:38:33] Someone say forgiven.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Accepted
[1:38:38] and counted as righteous
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; in the sight of God. We are justified.
[1:38:44] That's what true justification is. To be
[1:38:46] made right in God's sight by our faith
[1:38:49] in the work that Jesus did on the cross.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Because the Lord accepts nothing but his
[1:38:55] righteousness. And there's only way to
[1:38:57] have perfect righteousness and that's
[1:38:58] the righteousness of Jesus Christ
[1:39:00] because he perfect he perfectly
[1:39:02] fulfilled the demands of justice that
[1:39:05] were demanded by the law. His death
[1:39:08] satisfied forever the justice of God
[1:39:12] regarding sin.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad that I can I'm glad, you
[1:39:17] know, for my good days. But let me just
[1:39:19] tell you, they're not all good days. But
[1:39:20] I'm so glad that there's a grace to
[1:39:22] cover me when I don't have a good day.
[1:39:24] There's a go. I'm glad because I don't
[1:39:26] always feel like I'm a good Christian.
[1:39:28] BUT EVEN WHEN I DON'T FEEL LIKE A GOOD
[1:39:30] CHRISTIAN, IN GOD'S EYES, I'M PERFECT IN
[1:39:32] CHRIST JESUS.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; OH, YOU OUGHT TO LET that give you joy
[1:39:36] tonight TO SAY IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I
[1:39:38] FEEL LIKE. BECAUSE A LOT of times I
[1:39:40] don't feel like much, but that doesn't
[1:39:42] matter cuz his word says I am free in
[1:39:45] Christ.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; My sin was judged on the cross. Yes.
[1:39:49] Praise God.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; And so, NONE OF THOSE THINGS, NONE OF
[1:39:52] THOSE THINGS you can count. You can't
[1:39:54] count on any good work. I'm just
[1:39:57] preaching you very simply on
[1:39:58] justification. And this is all we'll get
[1:40:00] to tonight. We'll move on next, Lord
[1:40:02] willing. Uh uh the next time. Oh, all of
[1:40:06] those things. You can count any of those
[1:40:08] things. I don't care what you want to
[1:40:10] name here tonight.
[1:40:14] You're good. You know, the the the the
[1:40:16] good people. And and you I'm I'm not I'm
[1:40:18] not even making a distinction between
[1:40:20] that, but you know, good, clean, moral,
[1:40:23] faithful people, folks who don't cheat,
[1:40:25] folks who don't lie, steal, drink,
[1:40:27] smoke, drugs, gamble, you know, uh uh
[1:40:30] gossip,
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; all of those things Christians ought to
[1:40:34] live. You say, "Brother Matt, what is
[1:40:35] that?" That's what a Christian ought
[1:40:36] that's how a Christian ought to live.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; But let me just say, none of those
[1:40:40] things will will get you through.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; None of those things will save you. None
[1:40:44] of those good works will get you in a
[1:40:45] rapture. Amen.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; You can't count on any of them to obtain
[1:40:49] favor or acceptance with God.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Somehow people think that they'll stand
[1:40:54] before God on the basis of their good
[1:40:57] work so that they were good to animals.
[1:40:58] I've heard a man tell me that before.
[1:41:00] He's he'll go to heaven because he was
[1:41:02] good to animals.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; That's good to be good. It's good to be
[1:41:06] good people. It's good to be good to
[1:41:08] animals. Good to be good good you. But
[1:41:09] but you know it's one thing to be good
[1:41:13] to animals. How about that you take that
[1:41:14] same love for people? Amen.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; But none of those things matter. That's
[1:41:20] my sermon. That's that's not part of the
[1:41:23] real thing.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Those things are good, but none of them
[1:41:26] really matter in God's sight.
[1:41:30] We all have to understand one simple
[1:41:32] truth. We can be justified only by a
[1:41:36] revelation because faith is a revelation
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; of the work. What is the baptism of the
[1:41:42] Holy Ghost? It's a revelation of Jesus
[1:41:44] Christ to you personally.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Is that what God's prophet taught us?
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation of Jesus to you
[1:41:52] personally that he died for your sins.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; That he rose and when you he rose, you
[1:41:58] rose with him
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; and you're justified by faith. Not by
[1:42:02] works, but by faith in Christ.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; That simple work justifies. It's not
[1:42:08] enough to be justified, but you ought to
[1:42:10] be justified. You got to be justified.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; And this is where so many Christians,
[1:42:16] you can even say this because let me
[1:42:18] just tell you the rest of the story. I I
[1:42:21] it's if you go no further than
[1:42:23] justification
[1:42:25] and BY FAITH. IF YOUR DOCTRINE if all of
[1:42:28] your life ends to say I'm justified with
[1:42:30] Christ by faith and then that's all that
[1:42:32] I need. Let me just say friend you that
[1:42:35] you're in you're in great danger in that
[1:42:37] spot. And in fact, you're more in more
[1:42:39] danger than before God justified you.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Because because let me just say this.
[1:42:47] I'll be careful how I say it, but
[1:42:50] one of the most dangerous places that a
[1:42:52] person can be is clean but empty.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; You You'd been better to be dirty and
[1:42:58] full of sin than to be clean
[1:43:01] but devoid of the spirit of God.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Is that what your Bible says? says it
[1:43:07] Matthew chapter 8 and Jesus says when
[1:43:09] the unclean spirit goes out of a man he
[1:43:11] he he you know he goes in a dry place he
[1:43:13] comes back the house is swept clean but
[1:43:15] he findeth no one there then he goes and
[1:43:16] gets him seven other spirits worse and
[1:43:18] he says Jesus says the state of the man
[1:43:20] is worse
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; clean and empty than before when he was
[1:43:25] dirty and full
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; because one of the most dangerous places
[1:43:28] to be is in church
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; say brother Matt did you say that right
[1:43:34] one of the most dangerous places to be
[1:43:36] is in church Yeah.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Because you're held accountable for the
[1:43:40] truth that you
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; hear. That's right.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And so as truth is being preached,
[1:43:46] you've got a choice to either reject it,
[1:43:48] resist it, or humble ourselves and
[1:43:51] accept it.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; And so here's where Christians fail.
[1:43:56] They say, "I'm righteous because of
[1:43:58] Christ
[1:44:00] or or I I am the righteousness." Let me
[1:44:03] just let me just say it this way. The
[1:44:05] perfect righteousness of Christ is not
[1:44:08] infused or somehow poured in as we can
[1:44:10] say it that way. BUT WE ARE ACCOUNTED
[1:44:13] RIGHTEOUS. ABRAHAM WAS IT WAS ACCOUNTED
[1:44:16] unto him OF RIGHTEOUSNESS BECAUSE GOD'S
[1:44:19] EYES WASN'T LOOKING AT ABRAHAM. NOR IS
[1:44:21] HIS EYES looking at you. But when he
[1:44:23] looks at you, he sees the blood. AND THE
[1:44:26] BLOOD IS WHAT JUSTIFIES ME. NOT MY
[1:44:28] WORKS. It's the blood. I'VE GOT A
[1:44:31] PERFECT SACRIFICE. YOU SAY, "BROTHER
[1:44:32] MATT, ARE YOU PERFECT?" I'M NOT. BUT
[1:44:34] I'VE GOT A PERFECT LAMB. AND WHEN GOD
[1:44:36] LOOKS AT MY SIN, HE DOESN'T SEE IT. HE
[1:44:38] SEES MY SACRIFICE.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WHAT ABOUT YOUR WORKS? IF IT'S
[1:44:42] A BAD DAY, DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S A DOWN
[1:44:45] DAY, a low day, an out day, God's blood
[1:44:48] still atones for my sins."
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; And so that that this is this is what
[1:44:54] Paul was preaching. This revelation of
[1:44:57] being justified by the perfect
[1:44:59] righteousness of Christ. I've been one
[1:45:01] hour. I'm going to close right here.
[1:45:04] And so this is what it really means. As
[1:45:07] brother Brandham says, true
[1:45:09] justification by faith. Listen, I'm just
[1:45:11] going to read a few things and I'm just
[1:45:13] going to close.
[1:45:16] That when God comes in you and
[1:45:18] regenerates your life,
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; because brotherham taught that the true
[1:45:24] Holy Ghost, the true baptism, the real
[1:45:27] thing, the real thing. You say, "Brother
[1:45:29] Matt, I heard all of this as a child.
[1:45:31] Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost, Holy
[1:45:34] Spirit, Holy Ghost, new birth. What is
[1:45:37] it? Let me make it simple. I'm going to
[1:45:39] give you simple because I because we
[1:45:41] received it simple by a simple prophet.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Who made it so simple?
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is literally literally
[1:45:50] the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; coming to dwell in you.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the Holy Ghost.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; It is literally the literal life. What
[1:46:06] is the Holy Ghost? It's what brother
[1:46:07] Brandham says here. What is the Holy
[1:46:09] Ghost? What is the Holy Ghost? It is the
[1:46:12] spirit of Christ in you. It's the seal.
[1:46:15] It's a covenant. It's a sign. It's the
[1:46:18] spirit of Jesus Christ in you. In other
[1:46:22] words, the Holy Ghost is the comforter
[1:46:24] that Jesus promised that he would send.
[1:46:27] Christ's own spirit returning to indwell
[1:46:32] his people. Brother Adam says it this
[1:46:34] way. I love this so much. And what is
[1:46:36] the Holy Ghost? He says it's God's open
[1:46:39] door.
[1:46:41] It's a sign. It's a seal. It's a
[1:46:44] comforter. It's an advocate.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; That means it's my lawyer. It's my
[1:46:50] attorney. It speaks for me.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; It is the assurance. It is rest. It's
[1:46:56] peace. It's goodness. It's healing. It's
[1:46:59] life. It's God's open door to Christ.
[1:47:02] So then a true believer, listen, a true
[1:47:06] believer, the Holy Ghost is the very
[1:47:08] presence of God, the pillar of fire, the
[1:47:10] spirit of God living inside, bringing
[1:47:13] new life, craving for new new things,
[1:47:16] craving that you say, Brother Matt, what
[1:47:17] craves the word of God in you? Not me.
[1:47:19] The Holy Ghost inside of me is craving
[1:47:22] to feed upon the word,
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; bringing new life, bringing the power of
[1:47:27] God into the believer's life. Brother
[1:47:29] Brandham says that that same Holy Spirit
[1:47:31] would was sent to continue the works of
[1:47:34] Jesus in the church. He says here, if
[1:47:37] that spirit living in Jesus Christ made
[1:47:40] him do and act the way he did, you'll
[1:47:44] have some general idea how he'll do when
[1:47:46] it's in you.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that life cannot change.
[1:47:52] Say, "Brother Matt, what what is make it
[1:47:54] make it clear? The Holy Ghost is Christ
[1:47:58] himself in spirit form coming to the
[1:48:01] believer as a seal
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; of redemption,
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; an earnest a down payment
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; of a future full redemption."
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When God changes our body,
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; musicians, could you come?
[1:48:22] Say, "Brother Matt, who can receive it?
[1:48:24] Who's it for?
[1:48:29] Repent, every one of you, and be
[1:48:32] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:48:35] the remission of sins, and you shall
[1:48:38] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:48:41] For the promise is unto you, to your
[1:48:43] children, to them that are a far off,
[1:48:46] even as many
[1:48:48] as the Lord our God shall call.
[1:48:52] As many
[1:48:54] as he
[1:48:56] shall call.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. across all time, all families, all
[1:49:01] generations.
[1:49:04] God, brother Brandham says, will fill
[1:49:06] every soul that's earn that earnestly
[1:49:10] hungers for the Holy Ghost.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:15] And I just want to say, Lord, maybe as
[1:49:17] we just preached here today, and I'm
[1:49:18] stopping now, every head bowed and every
[1:49:21] eye closed,
[1:49:22] maybe just a real simple prayer you
[1:49:25] could pray.
[1:49:29] And maybe it would just be this. Lord,
[1:49:32] will you make me to hunger
[1:49:34] and make me to thirst?
[1:49:37] I can't do that, Lord, but you can.
[1:49:43] May the Holy Ghost so hunger,
[1:49:47] so thirst to get to such a place, Lord,
[1:49:52] that it's more than my daily bread.
[1:49:55] That I thirst for it more than I thirst
[1:49:58] for water. That I hunger for it more
[1:50:03] than I hunger for life.
[1:50:05] Make me to hunger, Lord.
[1:50:08] It's a gift. It's freely given, but and
[1:50:12] it's an experience I could have, but
[1:50:13] even after I have it, I've got to feed
[1:50:16] the Holy Ghost inside of me.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; I've got to feed it. Lord, that's my
[1:50:20] sincere prayer out of a sincere place in
[1:50:22] my heart. Could you stand to your feet
[1:50:24] tonight, everyone around, and raise your
[1:50:26] hands up and say, "Lord, I that's my
[1:50:28] sincere request, my sincere desire is I
[1:50:32] want the real thing, Lord. I want the
[1:50:35] real thing. Not a generated,
[1:50:39] not not just a dress code, not just a
[1:50:42] rule book, not just a church I was
[1:50:44] raised in, not just something my parents
[1:50:47] taught me, not something that the I've
[1:50:48] heard the preacher talk about, not cuz I
[1:50:50] fear going to hell, not cuz I fear
[1:50:52] tribulation. That that that's that may
[1:50:54] be one stage in your life. That's why
[1:50:56] you come to church. You're afraid of
[1:50:57] missing the rapture. afraid of. But
[1:50:59] friends, oh but can I say a relationship
[1:51:01] with Jesus when you really know him, you
[1:51:04] don't love him out of fear. You don't
[1:51:05] serve him out of out of fear and what'll
[1:51:07] happen if you you know it's not cuz you
[1:51:09] fear hell. You've got a revelation
[1:51:10] you'll never go to hell. You've got a
[1:51:12] revelation you're part of him. But when
[1:51:14] you really know him, it's just like your
[1:51:17] best friend. Someone you can talk to.
[1:51:20] Someone you could pour your heart out
[1:51:21] to. Someone you could pour your burdens.
[1:51:24] Take your needs to. Say, "Lord, I want
[1:51:27] to know you. Here's my simple prayer.
[1:51:29] Lord, I want the real thing. I don't
[1:51:33] want something fake. I don't want to be
[1:51:36] a fake. I don't want to be a hypocrite.
[1:51:38] I want to be who I am, Lord. And I want
[1:51:41] the real the real evidence, Jesus.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Not what someone has told me, but not
[1:51:46] just a work, not chasing an emotion, not
[1:51:49] chasing some kind of thing. I WANT TO
[1:51:50] KNOW THAT I'VE GOT A HOLD OF THE real
[1:51:52] thing.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; I want to know it. Lord Jesus, your
[1:51:55] prophet told me it ain't a hope. So,
[1:51:58] it's a no. So, and I want that no so
[1:52:01] down in my soul. I want to be so
[1:52:04] justified in my heart as though I never
[1:52:07] did it in the first place. My legal
[1:52:09] status has been changed in the eyes of
[1:52:11] God. I'm accepted based upon his perfect
[1:52:15] sacrifice. Jesus,
[1:52:17] grant to every heart, every life, every
[1:52:20] hand that was raised. I pray God that
[1:52:22] you would take these words, Lord, that
[1:52:23] I've spoken, God, and may they just
[1:52:25] begin to work in someone's heart, Lord.
[1:52:28] How could it be, Father, that Lord,
[1:52:30] maybe it would be that someone would
[1:52:32] hear this here tonight, Lord, that would
[1:52:34] start just something down on the inside,
[1:52:36] maybe push back the darkness just enough
[1:52:39] to let the word, the light of the word
[1:52:41] of God, shine down into that seed, and
[1:52:44] it just starts something maybe so small,
[1:52:48] Lord, but may it lead to a life that
[1:52:50] surrenders to you, dedicates their heart
[1:52:53] to you. That's why we preach. That's why
[1:52:57] we gather. That's why we study. That's
[1:52:59] why we pour out our lives, Lord. It's
[1:53:02] God's for one simple purpose. So that
[1:53:05] someone might know you
[1:53:07] in the power of salvation and the power
[1:53:10] of true saving faith.
[1:53:13] In the power of real transformation,
[1:53:16] the real thing.
[1:53:18] Grant it Jesus. Grant it Lord.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:26] From this time on
[1:53:30] and ever more.
[1:53:33] Oh my hope
[1:53:37] is in the Lord
[1:53:41] forever
[1:53:43] more.
[1:53:46] Oh, let's sing this. I stand in all. I
[1:53:49] stand in awe within the presence of the
[1:53:54] Lord. In whom and whom the wisdom of the
[1:53:59] aes
[1:54:01] lie.
[1:54:03] Oh, in whom the raing of the sea
[1:54:08] subside,
[1:54:10] the living sacrifice, living sacrifice,
[1:54:15] the only source
[1:54:18] of life. My hope
[1:54:21] always is in the wall.
[1:54:26] From this time on
[1:54:30] and never
[1:54:34] my hope, yes it is, is in the Lord
[1:54:41] forever
[1:54:43] more.
[1:54:45] His tender mercy, oh his tender mercies
[1:54:50] come with every rising sun to meet to
[1:54:56] meet the sinner in his brokenness
[1:55:03] to offer healing and forgiving.
[1:55:08] Oh, and those who trust, this is a
[1:55:11] promise.
[1:55:13] Oh yes, will find their heart. Oh, let's
[1:55:17] raise our hands now. My hope
[1:55:22] is in the Lord.
[1:55:26] From this time on
[1:55:29] and ever more.
[1:55:32] Oh
[1:55:34] my hope. Yes, it is. Oh, I want to let
[1:55:38] the world know
[1:55:40] forever
[1:55:42] more.
[1:55:44] Oh, let Jesus know. My hope is in the
[1:55:46] Lord. Oh, my hope. Oh, my hope is in the
[1:55:52] Lord.
[1:55:55] From this time on
[1:55:59] and ever more.
[1:56:02] Oh
[1:56:03] my hope
[1:56:06] is in the Lord
[1:56:10] forever
[1:56:12] more.

[1:56:59] recovery. Amen. We want to have

[1:57:10] remember those meetings. Got a youth
[1:57:12] camp just like we have there. Those
[1:57:14] believers are gathered and so we just
[1:57:16] want to be praying the Lord moves in a
[1:57:17] mighty way. Continued prayer also for
[1:57:20] sister Deborah Lowry for perfect healing

[1:57:37] father and son trip. And so they're

[1:57:59] you just want to raise your hand to the
[1:58:00] Lord. Jesus, my hands up right now.
[1:58:03] Lord, I identify with this song. My hope
[1:58:06] is in you, Lord. It's not in myself, not
[1:58:09] in my works. Lord, I'm so glad of that.
[1:58:13] So glad to know I've been forgiven. So
[1:58:16] glad to know my sins are in the past.
[1:58:19] They're covered by the blood. All the
[1:58:21] ordinances that were written out against
[1:58:23] me, you nailed to a cross. And as the
[1:58:26] song says, I will bear them no more.
[1:58:29] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. It is
[1:58:32] well with my soul. My sin. Oh, the bliss
[1:58:35] of that glorious thought. My sin, not in
[1:58:38] part, but the whole.
[1:58:41] Jesus, I'm gr I'm grateful tonight,
[1:58:44] Lord. Maybe in a way that I've never
[1:58:46] been before for that atonement that you
[1:58:49] made for me on Calvary. I want a new
[1:58:51] revel. I want a new revival, Lord. Let
[1:58:54] this book, let this Bible, give me a
[1:58:56] revival, God, to pick it up, to make it
[1:58:58] my daily bread, to make it the compass
[1:59:00] of my life, Lord. Not just a I'm not,
[1:59:03] not just to read it, Lord, but for you
[1:59:05] to speak through it, Jesus, that I may
[1:59:08] hear your spirit talk to me, leading me,
[1:59:10] guiding me, answering questions,
[1:59:12] dissolving doubts, removing fears,
[1:59:14] removing complexes. I pray, God, that
[1:59:17] you'd give our church that. May we fall
[1:59:19] in love with you all over again.
[1:59:23] I pray that you'd give our young people
[1:59:25] the real thing. Give my children the
[1:59:27] real thing that if they don't have it,
[1:59:29] Lord. Give all of our young people, all
[1:59:31] the old wouldn't matter, Lord. Lord, how
[1:59:33] long we've been in this journey. We want
[1:59:35] the real thing. Jesus.
[1:59:38] I believe it's drawing more and more,
[1:59:40] Lord, to a place, God, at time wrapping
[1:59:42] up and moving so fast, Lord, we ought to
[1:59:45] every day, as the Bible says, to make
[1:59:48] our calling and election sure. Let it be
[1:59:51] Jesus, for that foolish virgin and that
[1:59:54] wise virgin, the difference was that she
[1:59:56] was she had oil, Lord, and she was
[1:59:59] burning with oil. She was burning the
[2:00:02] midnight oil. I want to say, God, let me
[2:00:04] go into this year burning with a fresh
[2:00:06] zeal. Oh, how many wanted in here
[2:00:08] tonight to SAY, "LET IT. LET this year
[2:00:11] be a year I'm more zealous than I was
[2:00:13] last year. I'm more on fire, more
[2:00:16] fervent, more passionate than I was,
[2:00:18] Jesus. I want to see you more real in my
[2:00:21] life. Pray that you would do it, Jesus.
[2:00:24] Grant these requests to those that are
[2:00:26] still recovering. Sister Kathy. Lord, I
[2:00:29] pray God that you would your angel of
[2:00:30] healing would just do a complete work in
[2:00:33] her life.
[2:00:35] God, may she stand here amongst the
[2:00:37] saints and the tabernacle, the
[2:00:39] congregation, Lord, in worship with us,
[2:00:41] Father, and freedom of that sickness. I
[2:00:44] pray for Brother Brad, brother Zachary
[2:00:46] there in Honduras. May you just move
[2:00:48] even now, God, in the service. I pray,
[2:00:50] Lord, may you use our brothers mightily.
[2:00:53] Anoint them, God. Father, use them as
[2:00:55] tools in your toolbox. Lord, I pray for
[2:00:58] sister Deborah also not here, God,
[2:01:00] suffering in her back. God, I I can
[2:01:02] identify with that. So many of us can.
[2:01:05] You're my healer. You're Jehovah Rafa.
[2:01:07] Lord, I pray that you would go to our
[2:01:09] sister just now on the wings of this
[2:01:11] prayer, Lord. And may you restore her
[2:01:13] completely, totally whole. Do a back
[2:01:16] surgery, God. I pray, Lord, one so good,
[2:01:19] Father, that she never suffers from it
[2:01:21] again. I pray also Lord Jesus for
[2:01:24] brother Joe Carter also can Lord just to
[2:01:27] call out his name not here tonight. I
[2:01:29] just lift up his name brother Joe Carter
[2:01:31] tonight God may you go to him even maybe
[2:01:33] streaming this service maybe not Lord
[2:01:35] but may you just Lord I pray God this
[2:01:38] continue to do a work of healing in my
[2:01:40] brother's life Lord God till he's
[2:01:43] completely set free. I pray Jesus also
[2:01:46] for my mother Lord sick or not sick but
[2:01:49] in her back and her hip God we're all
[2:01:51] needy all these needs that I've read
[2:01:53] here tonight Lord I'm so glad that
[2:01:55] you're a healer of our body Jesus may
[2:01:58] you just come and be real Lord God and
[2:02:00] may you do a work I pray God that would
[2:02:03] we could testify about for brother
[2:02:05] Travis brother Mason Lord as they leave
[2:02:08] next week on this trip I pray God that
[2:02:10] your spirit would be ever near to them
[2:02:12] Jesus may you use it Lord God, for a a
[2:02:15] time, Lord God, of of refreshment to our
[2:02:18] brother, Lord, to Mason. I pray that you
[2:02:20] would keep them, Lord, protect them,
[2:02:22] watch over them, Lord. May a peace, not
[2:02:24] a fear, Lord, but a peace just settle
[2:02:26] down over their hearts. I pray, God, in
[2:02:28] their home. May you just be be the watch
[2:02:31] over it, Lord. You're our portion.
[2:02:33] You're our defender. You're our refuge.
[2:02:35] You're a strong and mighty tower, Lord.
[2:02:37] And we look to you now for all of these
[2:02:39] needs on behalf of all these unspoken
[2:02:41] requests.
[2:02:43] We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:02:46] We're going to let you be dismissed at
[2:02:48] your own leisure. Amen. Lord willing,
[2:02:50] we'll see you. Okay. Okay, I'll do it.
[2:02:53] Amen. You can stop here for a moment. I
[2:02:55] I did get a reminder. I tried to get
[2:02:57] this in on Sunday, but I wasn't able to.
[2:02:59] So, I I would be remiss not to share it
[2:03:02] now. And for those that haven't heard,
[2:03:04] and maybe those on the online can hear
[2:03:05] it, the Lord just did something uh
[2:03:07] really spared our life. The devil's
[2:03:09] always uh prowling and always trying to
[2:03:12] um do anything. Brother Brandham said
[2:03:14] that he said if he could take me out,
[2:03:15] he'd do it. And so, but the angels of
[2:03:17] God, I believe, are watching over his
[2:03:20] children watching over us last Saturday
[2:03:22] um about sometime in the day. I make
[2:03:25] this as maybe briefing. Gideon text me
[2:03:27] if I get it anything wrong or say leave
[2:03:30] something out. He's good about keeping
[2:03:32] it. Uh I'll and I mean that because I'll
[2:03:34] skip over things and uh don't mean to.
[2:03:37] But um we had our out there on property.
[2:03:40] We have a propane tank and uh they had
[2:03:42] came out the uh uh it was told to fill
[2:03:45] it when it hit 30%. So after
[2:03:47] Thanksgiving and all the cooking of
[2:03:49] Christmas, I went out there and checked
[2:03:50] it and it was at 25 between 25 and 30.
[2:03:53] Had a man come out initially said he
[2:03:55] needed me to clear a little pathway.
[2:03:56] Couldn't fill it. Then I had Saturday,
[2:03:58] it was Friday, Saturday, a man called me
[2:04:00] and from Frell and uh he uh said he
[2:04:03] wanted to come out fill the tank. I
[2:04:05] said, "Well, we need to clear a path."
[2:04:07] He said, "Uh, you know, I can get to it.
[2:04:09] Don't worry about it. I'll fill it, you
[2:04:10] know, fill it up for you." I said,
[2:04:12] "Well, I'm not home." You know, he said,
[2:04:13] "Is anybody home?" I said, "Yeah, my
[2:04:15] wife's home. You can go there. It'll be
[2:04:16] fine." So, he went out there and he and
[2:04:18] he uh filled the tank. He called me
[2:04:20] back. He said, "I put 85 gallons in it
[2:04:22] and you're good to go. You're, you know,
[2:04:23] you're good. You know, you left the
[2:04:25] receipt with your family." So, I got
[2:04:27] home about 6:00 p.m. I don't know what
[2:04:28] time it was around 6:00 that evening, me
[2:04:30] and Ethan. And uh and I I I the garage
[2:04:35] door before I'd gotten home had got left
[2:04:36] open apparently, but when I got home, it
[2:04:39] was closed. So I I I was in the house.
[2:04:41] We were just about to cook maybe start
[2:04:43] dinner and I was going to take a shower
[2:04:45] and I went out before in my in my
[2:04:47] garage. I have a refrigerator with some
[2:04:50] um uh just some refreshments. And so I
[2:04:52] went in there and and grabbed a a soda
[2:04:54] and I a drink and I I when I opened the
[2:04:57] garage door, I smelled really really
[2:05:00] strong smell of propane. and with the
[2:05:02] garage door shut and I thought, "Wow,
[2:05:03] you know, I'm a plumber. I smell gas,
[2:05:05] especially, you know, that smell all the
[2:05:07] time." Immediately knew what it was. And
[2:05:09] uh and so uh I I thought I told Rachel,
[2:05:12] I said, "There's there's a there's um a
[2:05:15] really strong smell of um of gas in my
[2:05:18] garage in the garage." I said, "Is there
[2:05:20] a propane tank, a cylinder maybe from
[2:05:21] the turkey fryer or something we left?"
[2:05:22] She said, "No, there's nothing." She
[2:05:23] said, "I smelled it, too. Really, really
[2:05:25] strong smell." And so I um I said,
[2:05:28] "That's" She said, "That's You sure
[2:05:29] that's gas?" I said, "Yeah, that's
[2:05:30] definitely gas." So, I'm looking around.
[2:05:32] Are you sure there's no propane tank in
[2:05:34] here? And she said, "Well, the garage
[2:05:35] door was left open and they filled the
[2:05:37] tank up today." So, I said, "Okay." I
[2:05:38] raised the garage door. I walked
[2:05:40] outside. It was dark and I just smelled
[2:05:42] as best I could right there in my
[2:05:43] driveway and couldn't smell nothing.
[2:05:45] Tank's about 30 ft away in the woods.
[2:05:46] Didn't smell anything. So, I went back
[2:05:48] in, took a shower, closed the garage
[2:05:50] door, and I thought, I better just go
[2:05:51] check that tank just to make sure. It's
[2:05:53] how propane is, for those of you that
[2:05:55] don't know, is is not like natural gas.
[2:05:57] Natural gas is lighter than air, so it
[2:05:58] lifts. propane does and it's heavy and
[2:06:00] it and it stays on the ground. It'll you
[2:06:02] know if it if the due point's real low
[2:06:04] it will really just spread out and uh
[2:06:07] and it's real dangerous. It's highly
[2:06:09] explosive way more dangerous than
[2:06:11] natural gas. And um and so I uh I went
[2:06:15] as I'm you know just getting out of the
[2:06:17] bathroom I I thought well I'm going to
[2:06:19] go out there and check it. So I get
[2:06:20] dressed. I get my flashlight and I start
[2:06:22] walking how family's just doing things.
[2:06:24] I walk towards the tank. I didn't get
[2:06:26] just right when I got to the wood line,
[2:06:27] I smelled it really strong. And I
[2:06:30] thought, "Wow, that's that's a bad leak.
[2:06:32] That's a really bad leak. I know what a
[2:06:34] bad leak is. That's a bad leak. It's
[2:06:36] really thick and strong." And so I
[2:06:38] immediately just turned around and I'm
[2:06:40] worried now. I learned later that it
[2:06:42] thankfully it's not, but we have a our
[2:06:44] house is way off the road, so we have a
[2:06:46] big old green box transformer. And I
[2:06:48] thought maybe it could be a source of
[2:06:50] ignition. Good to know. They're not.
[2:06:51] They're made that way to not be, but I
[2:06:53] thought and that's only 20 feet from my
[2:06:55] tank. I'm thinking if that gas propane
[2:06:57] is very explosive. And so if it gets
[2:07:00] over there and ignites, we're in
[2:07:02] trouble. And um and so I immediately
[2:07:04] called called the gas company emergency
[2:07:06] line. They said, you know, the on call
[2:07:08] techni technicians, you know, coming uh
[2:07:11] he'll call you. And so I I I get a call.
[2:07:14] I called the fella, you know, that uh
[2:07:16] anyway, move on past that. But the the
[2:07:18] man calls me on Call Tech and he says,
[2:07:20] "Hey, uh, you know, my name is this."
[2:07:22] And he says, "I'm on my way out." And he
[2:07:24] says, "You think you got a gas leak?" I
[2:07:25] said, "No, I know I got a gas leak." I
[2:07:27] said, "I'm a you know, I'm a plumber. I
[2:07:28] smell this all the time. There's
[2:07:29] definitely a real strong gas leak. A
[2:07:31] good a goodsized one." And I said, "I
[2:07:33] don't know if it's even safe to be
[2:07:34] here." He says, "Well, do you see a
[2:07:36] plume uh of smoke, you know, of of, you
[2:07:39] know, because that's what propane looks
[2:07:40] like. It looks like a Halloween scene.
[2:07:42] If you ever seen it really leaking out,
[2:07:44] it has like a mist and a fog." He says,
[2:07:46] "There are white plume." So, I shine my
[2:07:48] flashlight from my back porch about 30
[2:07:49] ft away and there's nothing. So, I'm on
[2:07:51] the phone with him. I go back in. He
[2:07:52] says, "Look at the receipt. How many
[2:07:53] gallons did he put in it?" I said, "So,
[2:07:55] I look at the receipt. I'm looking and
[2:07:57] and it says 85.6." And I said, "85.6."
[2:08:00] He said, "Okay, well, you know, 250 and
[2:08:02] you know that's 85." He said, "That's
[2:08:03] good." You know, and he he says, "You
[2:08:05] sure there's no white plume?" So, I
[2:08:06] said, "Well, let me go check." So, I
[2:08:07] open the door again and while I'm
[2:08:09] standing out there, I hear um what if I
[2:08:12] just rather than imitating if you've
[2:08:14] ever unplugged an relief valve on an air
[2:08:17] compressor, that's exactly what it
[2:08:18] sounded like. And the blowoff valve,
[2:08:20] which is only is an emergency valve that
[2:08:22] goes on a propane tank and expels at 150
[2:08:25] PSI the gas blew on that thing. This is
[2:08:29] loud. He heard it on the phone. And and
[2:08:32] when he heard that, he he he really got
[2:08:36] panicky and he started yelling saying,
[2:08:38] "Get your family out of your house now.
[2:08:40] Run. Get out of there. Call 911 now. Get
[2:08:42] away from the home." So we go into mode
[2:08:45] of getting everybody quick. I I realized
[2:08:47] my family needs to practice some stop,
[2:08:48] drop, and roll. And
[2:08:53] need to do some fire drills. And uh
[2:08:55] because we we you know anyway um and I'm
[2:08:58] not good. I'm I'm not good. Uh I'm I
[2:09:00] take after my mom. I'm I'm probably not
[2:09:03] good in in in you know I'm not the guy
[2:09:05] who's cool and calm and collected when
[2:09:07] it's when it's really uh need when I
[2:09:10] need to be. And so I was really
[2:09:11] panicking and I said get out everybody
[2:09:13] get out now. I'm on the phone. I hang up
[2:09:15] the phone. I'm trying to dial 911. He's
[2:09:17] telling me call the fire department.
[2:09:18] They got to shut it down. We go off with
[2:09:21] the animals and we're going up Jasmine
[2:09:23] Hall Road just as fast as barefooted. Me
[2:09:25] I think me and Ethan didn't have
[2:09:26] nothing. No didn't have no socks on.
[2:09:28] everybody's, you know, just running up
[2:09:30] the road trying to get away. And, you
[2:09:32] know, in your mind, you're thinking, you
[2:09:34] know, it's going to be just blowing up
[2:09:36] right behind you. And uh and so we get
[2:09:38] all the way down the road. We start
[2:09:40] walking up Jasmine Hall Road just
[2:09:42] waiting for the fire department. Now I'm
[2:09:44] trying to call Dominion to tell them,
[2:09:45] "Shut your transformer off, source of
[2:09:47] ignition." Here comes the fire
[2:09:49] department. We hadn't been on that road
[2:09:51] for 5 minutes, and here it comes. You
[2:09:54] could smell the propane on the road a
[2:09:57] thousand feet away from my house.
[2:10:00] And um you could smell it so strong.
[2:10:02] Fire department got there. They parked
[2:10:04] on the road. Several trucks. He's
[2:10:06] firefighters running at me. Where's the
[2:10:07] tank? Where's the tank? I'm trying to
[2:10:09] explain to him and where the tank is. He
[2:10:11] goes running. They go running up the the
[2:10:13] road and and uh they get it off. He
[2:10:16] comes back. He says, "Thank God we got
[2:10:18] it off." He says, "It's you, you know,
[2:10:20] it's not safe to go back right now." uh
[2:10:22] of you know whatever he said there, you
[2:10:24] know, we we didn't feel it was with all
[2:10:26] the smell and you could still smell it
[2:10:27] real real strong and um and so you know
[2:10:32] time elapsed and we I think we were out
[2:10:34] there um I think it uh yeah we couldn't
[2:10:37] start our our cars um you know because
[2:10:40] it would have it could have caused been
[2:10:42] a source of ignition and um I called my
[2:10:46] neighbor right away Steve the one
[2:10:48] closest to us are you guys home he said
[2:10:50] no we're in North Carolina said thank
[2:10:51] god got a situation. And so, uh, the
[2:10:54] firefighters got it off. He comes back
[2:10:56] and he and he and he and he, you know,
[2:10:58] after I think it was over two hours,
[2:11:01] something like that, we were on the road
[2:11:03] and, um, trying to hold the dogs down,
[2:11:05] trying to keep everybody calm. I was
[2:11:08] getting bit by fire ants and have no
[2:11:09] shoes on.
[2:11:12] And and so, so we finally make our way
[2:11:14] back and and it's safe to go back.
[2:11:16] Firefighters, you know, different ones
[2:11:18] are filling the effects. get checked out
[2:11:20] by EMS, feeling the effects of real
[2:11:22] drowsy Gideon was. Prayed for him. He
[2:11:25] was, you know, filling, you know, the
[2:11:26] effect of being under with all that
[2:11:28] propane, just everything. And and so um
[2:11:31] the the firefighter got off. Then the
[2:11:32] feral gas man showed up and uh he looked
[2:11:35] at it and he's trying to solve why did
[2:11:36] it blow why did the blowoff valve go
[2:11:38] off? What's wrong? The tank was just
[2:11:39] filled. What started this? How could
[2:11:41] this have happened? And and so he's
[2:11:43] looking at it and thank God I had
[2:11:45] brother Joe how shell and uh so thankful
[2:11:47] for for brother Joe and and I I called
[2:11:50] him cuz he couldn't the man couldn't
[2:11:52] solve it. And so he says something to
[2:11:54] Joe about 85 gallons in a 250. And Joe
[2:11:57] says that's not a 250 that's a 120.
[2:12:01] And he said what?
[2:12:04] He said that's a 120. Well, for those of
[2:12:06] you who don't know, you can't fill a
[2:12:09] propane cylinder up over 80%. Because
[2:12:12] it's liquid and vapor and with any kind
[2:12:13] of heat or anything, it turns it it it,
[2:12:16] you know, evaporates and vaporizes and
[2:12:19] and if there's no wear, no room for it
[2:12:23] to go. If the blowoff valve, the man
[2:12:25] said if the blowoff valve wouldn't have
[2:12:26] worked, you'd lost your home and your
[2:12:28] neighbor's home. And he said, "Thank God
[2:12:30] the blowoff valve worked to blow the gas
[2:12:33] out. That's the point. It's a safety
[2:12:35] device. And if you watch a video of it,
[2:12:37] it it's a like a nuc it's like a mini
[2:12:40] nuclear bomb. It's what it looks like.
[2:12:41] Big mushroom clown. And he said this is
[2:12:44] he said this is really the grace of God.
[2:12:46] That's what the propane man told me. He
[2:12:48] said that you guys were home could call.
[2:12:50] He said this could have been a
[2:12:51] catastrophic event. And um and they
[2:12:54] found out that the man who filled it
[2:12:56] mistook it for a 250 and it was a 120.
[2:13:00] So when we did the math, we had 115
[2:13:03] gallons in a 120galon tank. And so it
[2:13:06] was just the grace of God. I just want
[2:13:08] to give God thanks. Amen. That he kept
[2:13:11] us and watched over us and protected our
[2:13:14] family. Amen.
[2:13:17] Amen.
[2:13:19] And so uh we're thankful to God. Aren't
[2:13:21] you glad God keeps watch over his
[2:13:23] people? Amen. We're going to let you go.
[2:13:26] We'll see you, Lord willing, this
[2:13:27] weekend. You are great. You do miracles
[2:13:33] so great.
[2:13:36] There is no one else like you.

[2:14:07] else
[2:14:08] like you.
[2:14:11] You deserve the glory. You deserve the

[2:15:11] There is no one else like
[2:15:17] you.
[2:15:32] Oh,
