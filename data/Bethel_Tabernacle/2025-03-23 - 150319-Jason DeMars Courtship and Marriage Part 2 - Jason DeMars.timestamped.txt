[0:00] do.
[0:03] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we just
[0:05] come before you, Lord, and we ask that
[0:07] your presence would be with us, Lord.
[0:08] That you'd take your word and write it
[0:11] upon our hearts and in our minds. Lord,
[0:13] reveal yourself to us, Lord. We want to
[0:16] we want to see you in every line and in
[0:18] every place through the scriptures. We
[0:21] thank you, Lord. We commit ourselves in
[0:23] this time to you in Jesus name. Amen.
[0:26] Amen.
[0:26] Amen. If you want to go ahead and bring
[0:28] up the the PowerPoint, you got the
[0:30] PowerPoint, just not in the back.
[0:32] They're working on some issues. So,
[0:36] um, you can be seated. Forgot that I
[0:40] wasn't going to read the scripture just
[0:41] to start. So,
[0:44] that's my that's my usual tradition, but
[0:46] you got a little exercise. Got a squat
[0:48] in.
[0:52] So
[0:54] looking at
[0:56] uh courtship, you know, it's it's a
[1:00] journey to finding the love of our
[1:02] lives. And I think when we when we start
[1:05] to look at courtship, we can get very
[1:08] very serious about it and um severe
[1:11] about it. And of course, as we talked
[1:12] about last time, you know, it's really
[1:14] critical that we in in our lives, in any
[1:17] situation, any decision that we make
[1:19] that's so big like this, that we have
[1:22] the fear of the Lord. You know, that's
[1:24] the beginning of wisdom. Without the
[1:26] fear of the Lord, you're you're lacking
[1:28] even this foundation stone, the start of
[1:32] wisdom. And of course, when we approach
[1:34] finding the love of our life, we want to
[1:36] approach it with wisdom.
[1:39] Amen. And it's a lifelong commitment and
[1:43] it must be centered and surrendered
[1:47] completely to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:51] Um
[1:53] and so on the other hand is it can it
[1:56] can come and become something like uh
[1:58] especially for young men this is the
[2:00] formula. I don't ever have to talk to a
[2:02] girl. I can just go to her dad and uh it
[2:05] it it is a relationship of love, right?
[2:09] There is some kind of spark but we
[2:12] understand sparks can come and sparks
[2:14] can go. Really love is a lifelong
[2:17] commitment.
[2:19] Love is marriage is a covenant for life.
[2:23] You know people approach to it and what
[2:24] is the doctrine of marriage and divorce?
[2:26] What is my way out? Well, if you're
[2:28] Christian, you don't look at it that
[2:30] way.
[2:30] Amen. If you're a Christian, you you
[2:33] view marriage fundamentally as something
[2:36] that is a commitment for life. You don't
[2:39] give up. No matter how hard it is, you
[2:42] you don't quit.
[2:44] You're if you're a man, your wife runs
[2:46] away from you. You run with her.
[2:50] You don't you don't quit. You don't give
[2:52] up. You don't say, "I can't make it
[2:54] work." That's that's what the devil and
[2:56] the world speaks. It's a commitment for
[2:59] life. Brother Brandham says, 'Now that
[3:01] you know the teaching, don't never do
[3:03] that again. What in the world does he
[3:05] mean? Does he does he mean for us to
[3:08] make a huge mistake and say, 'Oh,
[3:10] I won't do it again. Well, you already
[3:12] did it.
[3:14] He preached it in 1965.
[3:17] So we should understand the teaching
[3:19] that it that marriage there is there is
[3:23] really uh I don't want to go too deep
[3:26] into this maybe I will later but
[3:28] marriage is a commitment for life. It's
[3:30] a covenant for life. The only real way
[3:33] to qualify for real marriage that we can
[3:35] say without a doubt is if your spouse
[3:37] has has passed away.
[3:40] If you're going another way you're
[3:42] trying to make an excuse here and I'm
[3:43] making an excuse here. Many times me uh
[3:46] men they don't love their wives. They
[3:48] don't treat their wives right and their
[3:50] wife leaves them and say ah he can she
[3:53] can't I can get remarried. She did that
[3:56] because you are such a jerk.
[3:59] And so now you think in the sight of
[4:02] God, you have an excuse for any reason,
[4:04] you can go ahead and get remarried when
[4:06] you were the cause for the pain and the
[4:09] affliction and the struggle and the
[4:11] trial because you refuse to do your
[4:13] God-given duty to be a man and to lead
[4:17] your family and to love your wife the
[4:19] way God calls upon you to love your wife
[4:20] and your family. No, that's that's not a
[4:23] scriptural way out. God intends for
[4:27] marriage to be for life. That is his
[4:29] purpose. It was not so from the
[4:32] beginning and it won't be until the end.
[4:33] That's what the prophet said when when
[4:35] talking about divorce. So if we really
[4:38] have a revelation of the message, I know
[4:39] you could say, "What about this
[4:41] situation? What about this situation?
[4:42] What about this situation?" If you're a
[4:44] young person and you haven't been
[4:45] married yet, take this as God speaking
[4:47] to you right now. There is no such thing
[4:50] as an out. There's no such thing as
[4:52] divorce. Otherwise, you're admitting
[4:54] that you are not an overcomer. You're
[4:57] you failed. I'm going to overcome in
[4:59] everything but this one. Oh, but it's
[5:01] this and this. Everything is an excuse
[5:03] and a mistake and you're a victim.
[5:06] Would you please be quiet?
[5:09] Stop crying. Stop whining and and do
[5:13] your duty before God.
[5:16] Times get hard, times get difficult, you
[5:18] want to quit and you want to give up.
[5:20] But if you have the spirit of God, you
[5:22] something will rise up within you to
[5:25] help you to overcome. What about this
[5:26] situation? And what about that? There's
[5:28] many situations. I understand that. I I
[5:31] can't preach about every situation in
[5:33] here. I am not condemning anyone here. I
[5:36] have no one in mind. But I'm trying to
[5:38] set forth the teaching.
[5:39] Yes.
[5:41] Correctly, especially to young people,
[5:43] but also to old people. So you can
[5:45] counsel young people correctly. There's
[5:47] no such thing as a divorce for a
[5:49] Christian.
[5:50] What about this situation? What about
[5:52] that situation? Stop.
[5:55] We we cannot base
[5:58] the teaching of the word of God upon
[6:00] this situation. We're looking for an
[6:02] exception. You're That's what the devil
[6:04] is trying to do. He's trying to give you
[6:06] an exception. What about this? I know
[6:08] this sister. I know this brother. I do
[6:11] too.
[6:11] Yeah. Amen.
[6:13] I do too. But we want to order our lives
[6:16] God's way.
[6:18] I know that sin comes in the picture,
[6:20] but sin will not have dominion over me.
[6:25] Have that confession,
[6:26] have that belief. God ordains the you
[6:30] for you young people. Not knowing the
[6:32] teaching of the word of God,
[6:34] understanding the the the strictness of
[6:36] this, there's a great joy.
[6:40] There is a great joy of learning
[6:43] to love someone. You say, "It's a spark.
[6:47] It's a It's a It's a this. It's the
[6:49] soulmate. It's all this." That's all
[6:51] well and good.
[6:53] There's some truth to that. Every lie
[6:55] has a little bit of truth to it. And so
[6:59] the modern world obviously through
[7:01] Hollywood, through the birth of
[7:03] Hollywood, and I'll say the opening up
[7:05] of the blowing of the fifth trumpet
[7:07] where hell was released upon the world
[7:12] through World War I.
[7:15] Even I don't want to get sidetracked,
[7:17] but what happened in World War I, if you
[7:20] study the history, it literally makes no
[7:22] sense. The only way you can make sense
[7:25] of it is when a prophet tells you that
[7:26] the first woe, the fifth trumpet is the
[7:30] the releasing of of the demon powers
[7:33] from the bottomless pit. Because none of
[7:35] it makes sense. It's a total departure
[7:37] from what everything that happened in
[7:39] the world prior to that. Hell is opened
[7:42] up. It took away it. It it brought forth
[7:45] women with the vote. It brought forth
[7:47] weak weak men that couldn't lead that
[7:51] allowed feminism and perversion to take
[7:54] place. It opened up
[7:57] insane decisions by kings and prime
[8:00] ministers to go to war for basically no
[8:04] reason. It's it was the demon powers
[8:07] releasing upon the earth. And at the
[8:08] very same time, what comes on the scene?
[8:11] Hollywood.
[8:13] So this is all part of the bottomless
[8:15] pit opening up and those demon powers
[8:18] streaming into the world and hell began
[8:21] to press itself into this dimension.
[8:25] And of course it's affected everything.
[8:28] It's also affected the courtship and
[8:30] marriage process.
[8:32] You know at one point in time we
[8:34] wouldn't really have to teach much about
[8:35] this. Our whole culture would be
[8:36] surrounded by doing it a biblical way.
[8:41] Now we have to teach about it. And many
[8:42] times you you you find out young people
[8:45] have never even heard a teaching on it
[8:47] before. Never understood it from the
[8:49] scripture. And so we got to go back
[8:52] not just assume that everybody knows it
[8:55] but really go into the scripture and
[8:57] show the biblical principles.
[9:00] You know when when the world departs
[9:03] from biblical principles what is the
[9:05] thing that happens is that hell takes
[9:07] its place.
[9:09] And every time Satan does it with a
[9:12] gradual process. It's always a gradual
[9:14] process. It starts out and you go back
[9:16] and you say, "Oh, it wasn't so bad then,
[9:18] but now this is the results of what we
[9:20] have today. We understand of course it
[9:24] is a journey of love. There is romance
[9:28] involved. There is joy involved. It's ne
[9:31] it's never to put that aside or dismiss
[9:34] that. It's fun. It's exciting. It's
[9:36] enjoyable. But that's not the main
[9:38] thing.
[9:40] That's that's the outworking of doing
[9:42] things the way God has designed for you
[9:44] to do.
[9:47] The the but the world has taken those
[9:50] portions of the outworking and turned
[9:52] that into this is everything.
[9:56] This is everything. And when that has
[9:58] happened, what when when the feelings
[10:00] and the emotions and all of that becomes
[10:02] the absolute, what ends up happening is
[10:06] the whole system fails.
[10:10] Mar the marriage covenant fails. Now
[10:13] many young people are aren't even
[10:16] thinking about getting married.
[10:18] They they don't see the value of it.
[10:20] They don't see the importance of it. Of
[10:25] course, we're trying to find the love of
[10:27] our lives. Of course, there's a lot of
[10:29] emotions that go along with it. I don't
[10:32] want to go back to finding finding a
[10:34] wife. Man, those those emotions are
[10:37] those are hard. And even when you find
[10:39] someone, it's up and down and you're
[10:41] just like the your cortisol levels are
[10:44] through the roof. I don't want to go
[10:46] through that. And yet, we we as as a as
[10:49] a married person over 20 years of
[10:51] marriage, you still face trials. You
[10:52] still face difficulties, but you face it
[10:55] together. And and out of those trials
[10:58] and difficulties, there's great joy and
[11:00] there's great peace in sharing a life
[11:02] together.
[11:04] But again, emotion is
[11:09] is the is what follows
[11:12] doing it God's way. It's what follows
[11:15] the covenant. We don't follow emotion.
[11:18] We follow Christ.
[11:20] Amen. When we follow Christ, we know
[11:22] emotion follows. All kinds of ones, bad
[11:24] ones, good ones, in between ones.
[11:28] But we can't be of the world because the
[11:32] world allows emotions to override the
[11:36] leadership of Jesus Christ.
[11:39] And that's where the great danger comes
[11:40] in. We'll we'll we'll go into that
[11:44] more later.
[11:47] I will use this PowerPoint. Judges 14
[11:51] 1-3. So let's let's kind of look at a
[11:54] few love stories in the Bible and how
[11:57] how they happened, how they went to p
[11:59] came to pass. And again, I'm I'm I'm
[12:03] looking at these not so much as this is
[12:06] how you know it has to be an arranged
[12:08] marriage or it has to be this type of
[12:10] arranged marriage, but I'm looking at it
[12:12] for the principles that are there behind
[12:14] that. Different cultures do marriage
[12:16] differently.
[12:17] Yeah. in in in ancient Israel, they did
[12:20] it. It was always an arranged marriage.
[12:23] You know, you see these see these movies
[12:25] and things and they're going back to
[12:26] ancient history and they look at that
[12:28] and they say, "Well, um,
[12:32] we want to just marry for love like the
[12:34] common people." Well, that that's funny.
[12:37] That's really funny. If you think that's
[12:40] how that actually worked for all of
[12:41] history, it's not how it actually
[12:43] worked. It's a new thing. You know, this
[12:46] is a this is a 20th and 21st century
[12:49] idea and ideal. Though there is an
[12:52] aspect to that where those things could
[12:54] did happen from time to time, the the
[12:57] norm was not that and it wasn't how
[13:00] people thought.
[13:02] So looking at Samson and Samson went
[13:04] down to Timnath and saw a woman in
[13:06] Timnath of the daughters of the
[13:08] Philistines. And he came up and told his
[13:11] father and his mother, and said, I've
[13:12] seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters
[13:15] of the Philistines. Now therefore, get
[13:17] her for me to wife. Then his father and
[13:19] his mother said unto him, Is there never
[13:21] a woman among the daughters of thy
[13:23] brethren, or among all my people, that
[13:25] thou goest to take a wife of the
[13:27] uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson
[13:30] said unto his father, "Get her for me,
[13:32] for she plea pleaseth me." Well, so of
[13:36] course you see here Samson sees a woman,
[13:39] wants to marry her, goes to her, goes to
[13:41] her mom and dad, make an arrangement,
[13:43] make an arrangement. And Samson is given
[13:48] godly advice,
[13:50] the right scriptural advice. Uh, I think
[13:52] you should marry a believer
[13:55] from from Israel. Nope, I don't care. Go
[13:57] get her for me. And of course,
[14:02] uh, Samson is an exceptional person.
[14:04] Everything about him is exceptionally
[14:06] weird and strange and don't follow in
[14:11] the footsteps of Samson.
[14:13] But nevertheless, we see even even for
[14:16] Samson,
[14:17] he understood there was a process. There
[14:20] was a there was a way to approach this
[14:22] scripturally.
[14:24] Genesis 24 1-4.
[14:28] And Abraham was old and wellstricken in
[14:30] age. And the Lord had blessed Abraham in
[14:32] all things. And Abraham said unto his
[14:34] eldest servant of his house, that ruled
[14:36] over all that he had, put, I pray thee,
[14:38] thy hand under my thigh, and I will make
[14:40] thee swear by the Lord, the God of
[14:42] heaven, and the God of the earth, that
[14:43] thou shalt not take a wife unto my son
[14:46] of the daughters of the Canaanites,
[14:48] among whom I dwell, but thou shalt go
[14:50] unto my country and to my kindred, and
[14:53] take a wife unto my son Isaac."
[14:57] So here we have a completely blind
[15:01] arranged marriage. And again, the bi I
[15:04] would I would say from being a student
[15:06] of the scripture, the Bible doesn't
[15:07] advocate for an arranged mar mar mar mar
[15:09] mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar
[15:09] mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar
[15:09] mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar
[15:09] mar mar mar mar mar mar marriage.
[15:10] Neither does it advocate against an
[15:12] arranged marriage. There's there's
[15:14] message believers today all across the
[15:16] globe that they have arranged marriages
[15:19] and there's process in Africa they have
[15:22] a little bit of different process and
[15:23] that can be different in by country in
[15:27] the Middle East they have a different
[15:28] pro everybody has a a little bit of a
[15:31] different process and that's okay as
[15:34] long as we're not following the
[15:36] direction and order of the world world
[15:38] and violating the scripture completely
[15:42] and So
[15:46] Abraham sends out his servant to find a
[15:49] wife. Abraham's servant wasn't really
[15:52] concerned necessarily about if she could
[15:54] have fun with Isaac.
[15:57] He didn't he didn't watch and look look
[15:59] at all these uh young ladies who has the
[16:01] right personality.
[16:04] He didn't go and say, "Hey, will you
[16:05] take this personality test? I need to
[16:08] find out if you uh align with Isaac."
[16:12] He didn't say, "What's your son sign?"
[16:15] Oh boy, that's not going to be good.
[16:16] You're not going to make a good match
[16:18] there.
[16:20] What did he do? He wanted the will of
[16:21] the Lord and the blessing of the Lord.
[16:25] Right? That's that is first and foremost
[16:30] young men, young ladies, you shouldn't
[16:32] be looking out and searching out for a
[16:33] husband. Right? We we'll talk more about
[16:37] that scripturally. Young ladies are
[16:39] given in marriage. Young men fi go out
[16:43] they leave their father and mother and f
[16:46] and go to find a wife. But the center of
[16:51] that is are you finding the will of the
[16:53] lord and the blessing of the lord.
[16:57] Then what was the next step? The next
[16:59] step was that servant went to the family
[17:01] of Rebecca told his testimony. this is
[17:04] the leadership of the Holy Ghost in my
[17:06] life and requested the permission to
[17:09] take Rebecca to Isaac.
[17:12] Then through the testimony they saw this
[17:14] was the will of God and gave her to the
[17:17] servant to bring to Isaac. Of course,
[17:20] this is obviously an arranged marriage.
[17:23] And again, it doesn't have to be done
[17:26] precisely this way. I don't I don't
[17:29] condemn it and I don't uh I don't say it
[17:32] must be done this way.
[17:34] But it's a wonderful outline that we
[17:36] have there. And it's important
[17:41] to understand two things. Is it the
[17:43] leadership of God?
[17:45] And then does the father give his
[17:47] daughter to the headship of another? And
[17:51] understanding that's not that's a
[17:53] process. The father giving the headship
[17:56] to another is a process. It's not just
[17:58] we're dating and we're going out and
[18:00] we're doing all this stuff and then at
[18:01] the end you say, "Can I have permission
[18:03] to marry your daughter?" It's it's from
[18:05] the beginning. It's from the start. It's
[18:07] a it's a respect from the start that
[18:10] courtship should take place.
[18:13] All right.
[18:15] So, looking at the past century, we're
[18:18] going to kind of start looking at uh
[18:20] some of the history. We won't have
[18:22] enough time to go through everything
[18:24] here, but this time and then the next
[18:26] time we'll start to look at some of the
[18:30] developments in Western culture. Again,
[18:32] it's important to emphasize Western
[18:34] culture because, you know, I've been to
[18:36] places where they absolutely if they use
[18:40] don't do it the way the Americans do it.
[18:42] They c they absolutely will condemn
[18:44] their children and when they preach
[18:46] they'll say don't do it the way the
[18:47] Americans do it because they feel like
[18:50] that's such a departure and a perversion
[18:52] from from the way that's God God does
[18:55] it. Don't date like those Americans.
[18:57] That's what they say in Egypt.
[19:00] So in the past century, Western culture
[19:02] has taken a completely new experiment.
[19:07] It's been a cultural journey uh starting
[19:11] with chaos is what it is centered but
[19:14] it's centered around how do we deal with
[19:17] these matters of the heart.
[19:21] We've witnessed
[19:23] the gradual formation of a mythology
[19:25] that encourages us to follow our hearts
[19:28] and it insists that true happiness lies
[19:31] in falling in love.
[19:35] But unfortunately, this this path often
[19:38] leads to a cycle of casual dating. I'll
[19:41] date this one, then I'll date that one.
[19:43] I'll date this one and date that one.
[19:45] And the whole point is follow your
[19:46] heart. Instead of as a Christian, we
[19:49] understand we don't follow our heart. We
[19:51] follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost.
[19:53] Amen.
[19:55] It's a huge, you know, any any young
[19:58] people under the sound of my voice or
[20:00] that would hear this. Um,
[20:03] this is not something you don't just run
[20:05] from one girl to one girl to one girl.
[20:07] You, if that's what you're doing, you
[20:09] yourself are a big red flag.
[20:12] And any godly father is going to say,
[20:14] "Stop. What is happening?"
[20:19] And even that even that in itself
[20:21] jumping from girl to girl to girl shows
[20:23] that there's fathers uninvolved with
[20:26] their daughters and with their sons
[20:29] which is a is is horrible
[20:34] in this system of casual dating. You
[20:38] could start anytime. You know, they
[20:40] start when they're little kids,
[20:42] practically
[20:44] pro progressing from a date to kissing
[20:46] and everything else that goes with that
[20:49] and then when the initial uh spark fades
[20:53] onto the next person, repeating the
[20:55] process.
[20:57] But the question is that is that even
[21:00] for a society, is that model
[21:02] sustainable?
[21:04] Unsurprisingly, it's not rooted in in
[21:07] scripture.
[21:08] And also, this cultural experiment has
[21:11] given rise to a 41%
[21:14] divorce rate in the US.
[21:18] And you look at that and understand that
[21:20] many people just aren't getting
[21:21] divorced. They just move in with each
[21:22] other
[21:23] and they consider that the the the
[21:26] commitment
[21:27] shacking up with one another. Of course,
[21:30] among message believers, we don't follow
[21:32] the world's systems.
[21:35] But then the question is, are we just
[21:37] doing like the the churches are? The
[21:39] churches are 10 years behind what the
[21:41] world is doing, right? They're always 10
[21:44] years. So then then are we as message
[21:48] believers 15 years or 20 years behind
[21:50] what the world is doing?
[21:52] That's not the standard.
[21:54] Amen.
[21:54] We don't we don't follow just if as long
[21:57] as we're more conservative than the
[21:59] world, we're fine.
[22:04] You you you didn't like that one very
[22:05] much. Neither do I.
[22:08] It's not scriptural. It's not the way we
[22:10] should be. We should be prophetic
[22:13] visionaries.
[22:14] This is the e We're living in the eagle
[22:16] age.
[22:18] We're We're living in the age of strong
[22:20] meat. Eagles don't eat milk. I didn't
[22:23] know if you knew that.
[22:25] Eagles are feasting on
[22:28] maybe when they're babies, they feast on
[22:30] a little bit of meat, but they're
[22:32] feasting on meat, right? And so that's
[22:35] the age we're living in. We can't be in
[22:37] the place where we're just a little bit
[22:39] behind what the world the churches are,
[22:41] a little bit behind what the
[22:43] denominations and the world is behind.
[22:46] You know, this this is something
[22:48] different. We have to be see
[22:50] prophetically into the scriptures and
[22:52] deliver ourselves from the world system.
[22:56] We as parents actually are the
[23:00] gatekeepers of this.
[23:02] So both parents and the five-fold
[23:04] ministry are the gatekeepers of biblical
[23:08] courtship because our kids are kids.
[23:11] They're going to grow up in the
[23:12] environment that we create for them. If
[23:15] we create an untethered environment
[23:18] where we're uninvolved and we got our
[23:19] own stuff going and our own
[23:21] entertainment and our own life and our
[23:23] kids are off just doing whatever they
[23:24] want to do, then what ends up happening
[23:27] is they're going to just do it however
[23:29] they want to do. And if we don't create
[23:32] the atmosphere through teaching them,
[23:34] you know, this shouldn't be a mystery
[23:36] and and suddenly you solve it at 15
[23:38] years old. This should be something
[23:40] that's being laid in from the time that
[23:42] they're little
[23:43] that you're teaching, that you're laying
[23:45] forth, that they're understanding so
[23:47] that when they it comes to the time that
[23:49] they're confronted, we don't have all
[23:50] these little boys trying to go behind
[23:52] father's backs to get a girl's phone
[23:55] number.
[23:57] They would already understand, well, I'm
[23:59] 13. What am I going to do with the girl?
[24:00] I can't I can't get her a home. I can't
[24:02] take care of her. What am I trying to
[24:04] have a relationship for? They should
[24:06] have been taught that. And it's it's um
[24:09] as brother Brandham
[24:12] said, people say it's
[24:15] child delinquency. Said, "Well, maybe
[24:18] it's parent delinquency." Well, he says,
[24:20] "No, that's what they say it is, but
[24:22] I'll say it's pulpit delinquency,
[24:25] and it must be taught. It must be laid
[24:27] in. It must be understood." And and and
[24:30] the five-fold ministry is there to equip
[24:32] the believers for the work of the
[24:34] ministry. We're we're to equip the
[24:37] saints.
[24:38] Amen.
[24:38] We're equip men to lead their homes, to
[24:41] lead their households to so that the
[24:44] children, this isn't a surprise. It
[24:46] isn't a shock.
[24:48] When it comes to a teaching on courtship
[24:50] that oh, the fathers are laying it in,
[24:52] the fathers are teaching that it's not a
[24:55] mystery.
[24:58] Well, praise the Lord.
[25:01] And
[25:01] that's what we want to examine, I guess,
[25:03] next time.
[25:04] because if I go much further, I'll be
[25:07] way way into the vi way way way into
[25:11] this. So, obviously, we understand,
[25:14] brother Brent, as we read last week,
[25:16] finding the love of our lives is the
[25:18] second most important decision we'll
[25:20] make our an entire lives outside of
[25:21] salvation.
[25:23] Love is a wonderful thing, but we have
[25:25] to remember there's a difference between
[25:27] filelio love, aeros love, and agape
[25:31] love.
[25:32] Amen.
[25:33] There's a difference between lust or
[25:36] falling in love with someone in an
[25:38] emotional situation and genuine love
[25:41] which means commitment.
[25:45] When we speak about falling in love,
[25:46] it's not as though we required some kind
[25:48] of uh virus.
[25:53] That's infatuation. Infatuation comes
[25:56] and goes.
[25:58] But it also this infatuation can often
[26:00] lead you to giving your heart to someone
[26:03] prematurely before there's any kind of
[26:07] commitment that takes place.
[26:10] And when you give your heart to someone,
[26:12] you're leaving a little bit of yourself
[26:14] behind. And when there's no commitment,
[26:17] they decide they don't want to be with
[26:18] you anymore. then you will suffer the
[26:21] consequences and the pain of having
[26:24] prematurely committed you yourself to
[26:27] someone that it wasn't the leadership of
[26:29] the Holy Spirit. That's when we say in
[26:33] courtship in relationships number one is
[26:36] it the leadership of God?
[26:38] Amen.
[26:38] When when Abraham sent his servant out
[26:41] the servant wasn't trying to find
[26:43] compatibility for Isaac.
[26:46] He was trying to find the will and the
[26:48] blessing of the Lord. Amen.
[26:50] That was first. And second, he went and
[26:54] said, "We do you give Rabi Rebecca to
[26:58] Isaac?
[27:00] Will you give permission for this
[27:01] daughter to go and be married to another
[27:04] and come under the headship of someone
[27:07] else?" Because ultimately, that's what
[27:08] marriage is. It's it's a daughter being
[27:13] given from the headship of her father
[27:16] unto the headship of another,
[27:19] her her mate for life, her husband for
[27:22] life, and it is a lifelong commitment.
[27:24] And so, how how much do we need the
[27:26] leadership of God above
[27:29] emotion? Again, emotion follows just
[27:32] just like in your Christian walk. You're
[27:35] not saved by emotion. You're not saved
[27:37] because you had had a a funny feeling
[27:40] come across you. You're saved because
[27:43] you believe because God is dealing with
[27:45] you. Because God has changed your life.
[27:48] Right?
[27:50] And then from that change comes all
[27:53] sorts of emotions.
[27:54] Amen.
[27:55] But the emotion isn't the proof.
[27:59] The the leadership of God in your life
[28:01] by the Holy Ghost is the proof.
[28:05] And so, of course, there's there's a lot
[28:08] more to this and that's why this is
[28:10] going to take probably 15 parts to get
[28:13] through it. So, let's stand and pray.
[28:21] Heavenly Father, we just want to thank
[28:23] you for your word. We want to commit
[28:24] ourselves to you. We ask that you would
[28:26] lead us by your spirit. We ask you bless
[28:28] the worship and the preaching of the
[28:29] word that you'd be glorified and lifted
[28:31] up in our midst. We ask these things in
[28:33] Jesus name. Amen.
[28:35] Amen.
[28:35] God bless you.
