[45:58] already thank you brother
[46:00] Mark we'll go directly to the word I'm
[46:02] calling this uh overcoming depression
[46:05] part two uh part one I think was over
[46:08] two years ago so I'm sure you all
[46:11] perfect recall so I'll be going over a
[46:14] lot of things that I covered back then
[46:17] but with a little bit different uh angle
[46:19] and this will be part two probably of a
[46:23] number of them going forward so let's
[46:28] look and we're going to read Proverbs 12
[46:33] verse 25 then you'll be able to have
[46:35] your
[46:36] seats anxiety in the heart of man causes
[46:40] depression but a good word makes it
[46:43] glad amen may the Lord add the blessing
[46:46] to the reading of his
[46:47] word
[46:50] amen so I'm to understand this is a nogo
[46:53] this
[46:54] morning
[46:55] okay all right I won't be walking around
[46:58] you know me I'll have to it'll be tough
[46:59] to stay
[47:06] stationary yeah the handheld if I want
[47:08] to start moving around I'll grab the
[47:10] handheld but the likelihood of that is
[47:12] not
[47:14] good sure appreciate brother Matthew's
[47:17] Sunday school this morning um what a
[47:20] blessing it was and how fitting it was
[47:23] tying into what I wanted to talk about
[47:27] this morning now going into it just to
[47:30] lay the
[47:31] groundworks God is a great healer and a
[47:35] deliverer and we want we are going to
[47:37] we're going to look into the scriptures
[47:39] and into the message and show this
[47:41] clearly Welcome to our guests forgot
[47:44] that appreciate you being here may God
[47:47] bless you
[47:50] um but I want I want to look at
[47:54] depression I want to look at the age
[47:55] that we're living in and the unique
[47:58] circumstances that we have around us and
[48:01] I want to look at the remedy that God
[48:05] gives to us through the scriptures God
[48:07] Is A
[48:09] Healer amen
[48:12] and at the same time God gives us keys
[48:16] to this Warfare because it is a it is a
[48:19] spiritual warfare and if we just treat
[48:22] it as thank you we need Deliverance oh
[48:25] I'm depressed I I need Deliverance I'm
[48:27] depressed I need
[48:28] Deliverance you'll keep you'll have
[48:30] you'll get healed and then you'll come
[48:32] back for another reason then you'll get
[48:33] healed and you'll come back for another
[48:34] reason and I say that because this is
[48:38] not this is a there is Specific
[48:41] Instructions from the scripture of how
[48:44] to handle these things amen and of
[48:47] course we understand mental health is is
[48:51] constantly surrounding us it's in the
[48:54] news it's in schools yeah and it's
[48:57] pushed and thrust Upon Us on Tik Tok on
[49:00] Facebook Instagram reals everywhere
[49:03] they're talking about their version of
[49:06] what mental health
[49:10] is
[49:11] and even that in itself is a great
[49:16] danger and we'll talk about why that is
[49:19] brother brandham says in letting off the
[49:22] pressure it's just a builtup pre
[49:25] pressure it's the age we're living in a
[49:27] neurotic age where people don't know
[49:29] what to do where they're going and the
[49:32] doctors don't have the answer for it
[49:33] because the psychiatrist is being
[49:35] doctored by the
[49:37] psychiatrists so they have not the
[49:39] answer but there's some answer surely
[49:42] somewhere where could we where where we
[49:45] could deal on it for hours but I was
[49:47] just thinking that God has the answer if
[49:49] they could just set in place like this
[49:52] takes off the pressure see with people
[49:53] who are entered into eternity we're not
[49:56] going into it we're already in it that's
[49:59] right amen all
[50:02] right yes sir I got abundant
[50:06] water now I want to start by saying
[50:09] there is real trauma that people go
[50:13] through that can result in long-term
[50:16] impact upon mental health There's real
[50:19] depression there is real anxiety there
[50:23] is also a real living Supernatural God
[50:28] that heals and delivers and gives us the
[50:31] keys to walk in overcoming power
[50:35] overcoming power is not just being
[50:38] pressed through a straw it's not being
[50:41] just well God healed me that sure that's
[50:46] a start but overcoming power is knowing
[50:49] how to defeat the enemy and keep his
[50:52] punches off you and even turn it into an
[50:55] offensive attack against the devil amen
[51:00] and so I I never want to diminish what
[51:02] someone's going through There's real
[51:04] demons am let's just put it that way
[51:07] there's real demons that people are
[51:09] suffering through and there's real dark
[51:12] places that people's minds go to and it
[51:16] is real but it's not more real than God
[51:19] and it's not more real than the word of
[51:23] God Psalm 34 ver verse
[51:28] 15 the eyes of the Lord are upon the
[51:31] righteous and his ears are open unto
[51:34] their cry the face of the Lord is
[51:36] against them that do evil to cut off the
[51:38] remembrance of them from the earth the
[51:41] righteous cry and the Lord hears and
[51:43] delivers them out of all their
[51:46] troubles the Lord is nigh unto them that
[51:48] are of a broken heart and save such as
[51:52] be of a contrite spirit praise the Lord
[51:57] so that's someone with a broken heart
[51:59] that's someone who is suffering they're
[52:01] they're sad they're in sadness they're
[52:03] in
[52:05] depression they're they're they're
[52:07] facing anxiety they're anxious and and
[52:11] the Bible says the Lord is near
[52:14] them the Lord comes near to them you
[52:17] don't have to think I'm alone God's
[52:19] abandoned me you actually have the word
[52:21] on it that when you're facing that God
[52:24] is near you all you have to do is call
[52:26] upon him Lord help me and save me yes
[52:30] and deliver
[52:32] me and he'll do it amen Psalm 69:20
[52:37] reproach has broken my heart see a
[52:40] broken heart
[52:41] again and I'm full of heaviness and I
[52:44] look for some to take pity oh my but
[52:48] there was none and for comforters but I
[52:50] found none my goodness well today
[52:55] there's all kinds of people that will
[52:56] take your pity for a
[53:01] fee you can keep going and keep going
[53:04] and keep going for a fee and they will
[53:06] have all kinds of
[53:09] pity and they will have all kinds of
[53:12] quote unquote Comfort
[53:14] okay I don't want I don't want you to
[53:16] think I'm against a psychiatrist I don't
[53:19] believers who are social workers
[53:22] psychiatrists and God can use them but
[53:25] not if they follow what the world is
[53:27] telling them to
[53:29] do and what the the unbelieving ungodly
[53:32] University is telling them to do God
[53:34] brings Deliverance by people that care
[53:37] and that love people and I don't stand
[53:39] here and say well Psy psychiatrists and
[53:42] social workers and counselors are just
[53:45] evil they do it because they want to
[53:47] help but there is a system look at that
[53:51] and there is a program and Satan is
[53:54] involved in
[53:55] it and there's a great danger in in all
[53:58] of that and you know we can look and say
[54:00] we're super spiritual we got the baptism
[54:03] of the Holy Ghost we don't have any
[54:04] problems are you
[54:10] nuts the Holy Ghost is the start of the
[54:15] Warfare the Holy Ghost is the beginning
[54:18] of of troubles but it doesn't have to be
[54:21] a continuation of troubles you've
[54:23] entered into the Warfare as a babe in
[54:25] Christ when you get the baptism of the
[54:27] Holy Ghost but you don't have to stay
[54:28] there you don't have to stay in a
[54:30] position of
[54:32] weakness all
[54:34] right I will praise the name of God with
[54:36] song and will Magnify Him with s
[54:39] Thanksgiving so here here the psalmist
[54:41] is saying I was alone no one was there
[54:44] to comfort me as a different
[54:47] age but there was no one there to
[54:49] comfort him sometimes we feel like that
[54:51] I'm alone no one understands no one can
[54:53] comfort me so what's the next step
[54:55] psalmist
[54:57] praise the name of your God with a song
[55:00] Magnify Him with Thanksgiving you can't
[55:03] stay unhappy
[55:05] long when you're giving thanks to God
[55:07] when you're remembering the great things
[55:10] that he's done for
[55:12] you this also shall please the Lord
[55:15] better than an ox or bulock that that
[55:17] has horns or hoofs the humble shall see
[55:20] this and be glad and your heart shall
[55:24] live that seek God for the Lord hears
[55:27] the poor and despise
[55:30] not his prisoners he heals the broken in
[55:33] heart and binds
[55:35] up their wounds amen you see God Is A
[55:40] Healer God is a deliverer and we that is
[55:43] that we have to start as Christians we
[55:45] have to start with that understanding
[55:48] whatever we're going through whatever
[55:51] situation we're facing however we
[55:54] feel we start with this God is a living
[55:59] God he's near you when your heart is
[56:02] broken all you have to do is call upon
[56:05] him and he will deliver you amen say Why
[56:09] didn't it happen
[56:11] instantly you know that better than
[56:14] that you know better than
[56:18] that God's not a vending
[56:22] machine God has a season and a purpose
[56:25] and a plan Jo job went through what he
[56:27] went through God didn't just snap his
[56:29] fingers the minute he said oh this is
[56:31] hard to deliver me from this there's a
[56:34] purpose there's a plan there's something
[56:37] that's God's doing you say I don't know
[56:39] what it is I I my heart is broken why
[56:42] doesn't he just step in now I don't know
[56:45] none of us know right amen but we do
[56:48] know the character of the one who is
[56:51] allowing us to go through this we know
[56:54] that he loves us we know that he wants
[56:56] want something even better for
[57:01] us as I was with Moses 1951 do you
[57:04] believe with all your heart that God
[57:05] will make you well oh heavenly father I
[57:07] pray you'll take this demon away from
[57:08] this woman come out of the woman in the
[57:10] name of Jesus Christ look lady you've
[57:12] been bothered a long time haven't you
[57:15] mental nervous depression is that right
[57:17] demons something haunts you and scares
[57:18] you is that right you accept me as God's
[57:21] Prophet raise up your hands and say
[57:22] thank the Lord for my healing go off the
[57:24] platform and forget all about it be well
[57:28] amen amen he's a
[57:31] Healer in faith Africa
[57:34] report are you the patient patient lady
[57:37] yes all right do you believe do you
[57:38] believe that God will reveal your
[57:40] troubles to me that's all I can do by
[57:42] the gift is that right now look you're a
[57:44] Believer filled with the spirit and now
[57:46] look you have a nervous condition a
[57:49] strain which is due to the time of it is
[57:52] with you and then another thing is you
[57:54] got a stomach trouble is that right
[57:55] that's right and your nervousness has
[57:58] caused the stomach trouble which is an
[57:59] ulcer in the stomach causes uh souring
[58:04] and so forth and swelling and sometime
[58:06] flurrying of the heart and your mental
[58:08] conditions and that you feel strained
[58:10] and upset all the time depressed is that
[58:12] right and many times Satan has told you
[58:14] you've crossed over the line and all
[58:16] those is that right but he's lied he's
[58:18] lied Jesus Christ has healed you do you
[58:21] believe that go eat what you want to eat
[58:23] then in the name of the Lord Jesus
[58:24] Christ bless you all right
[58:27] man so you see he is a
[58:29] Healer that lady had all those TR
[58:32] Troubles Down the Line believe it
[58:35] started with what was in her mind the
[58:37] anxiety and depression she was facing
[58:39] was bringing this upon this upon this
[58:42] upon
[58:43] that but God was mindful of her he knew
[58:46] what she was going through and he
[58:48] touched and healed her and delivered her
[58:51] amen amen in Hebrews chapter 2 1957
[58:56] brother Bram says the Bible said he
[58:57] ascended on high and gave gifts unto men
[59:00] there was an atmosphere hung over the
[59:02] Earth of Darkness of Gloom of death and
[59:04] weary the prayers couldn't come up
[59:07] because the atonement wasn't made but he
[59:08] broke through that Veil he opened up the
[59:10] way he broke the veil of sickness he
[59:12] broke the veil of sin he broke the veil
[59:15] of weary he broke the veil of depressed
[59:17] he broke every Veil and made a highway
[59:19] for the wayfaring man walking up the
[59:22] King's Highway amen
[59:26] God's word is what brings us healing
[59:28] thinking back on the first uh verse that
[59:31] I read anxiety in the heart of man
[59:35] causes depression but a good word
[59:38] delivers him from it amen what is that
[59:42] good word you could say it's positive
[59:45] well yes it is I believe it's this word
[59:47] right
[59:49] here God's Living Word revealed to our
[59:54] hearts brings healing yes amen a prayer
[59:57] line will do it laying hands upon the
[59:59] sick a gift of the spirit will do it the
[1:00:02] Holy Ghost in you in your home asking
[1:00:05] God will do it but more than that God
[1:00:08] actually has the remedy for us if we'll
[1:00:11] see what it if we can see what it is
[1:00:13] right in the
[1:00:14] scripture it's so
[1:00:17] simple now looking at this I want to go
[1:00:21] a little bit deeper into the problem
[1:00:24] that we're facing in this age and the
[1:00:27] atmosphere that is around us we know
[1:00:30] we're living in a nervous age brother
[1:00:34] bandam says traveling around from Nation
[1:00:36] to Nation I find that everyone seems to
[1:00:38] be nervous and the psych WS are filling
[1:00:40] up and the people are down the street
[1:00:42] there seems to be so much anxiety and
[1:00:44] rust just as hard as they can that they
[1:00:45] don't have courtesy even one for another
[1:00:48] and I've noticed it amongst all people
[1:00:50] amen
[1:00:53] amen we're living
[1:00:56] in an age that's plagued with anxiety
[1:01:00] and depression people are constantly
[1:01:02] facing
[1:01:04] demons that take their minds to dark
[1:01:07] places they even know
[1:01:09] it they may not be Christians but you
[1:01:12] say are you as to a young person
[1:01:14] teenager are you facing demons they'll
[1:01:15] say
[1:01:16] yeah really I'm facing demons they don't
[1:01:20] know anything about what that actually
[1:01:21] means but they they know that they're
[1:01:23] facing facing demons
[1:01:26] and it's taking people's minds into very
[1:01:30] dark places and we're living in this
[1:01:32] atmosphere and we have a mind too
[1:01:35] amen and people become plagued with
[1:01:39] anxiety Then that
[1:01:41] anxiety develops into depression that
[1:01:44] depression turns into dark thoughts of
[1:01:46] self harm even harming others we see
[1:01:49] that people become so uh uh traumatized
[1:01:53] in their own minds that they want to go
[1:01:55] and shoot up a school or whatever it is
[1:01:57] that they put the blame
[1:02:01] on in the 1950s and
[1:02:05] 1960s they say it was considered very
[1:02:08] rare for anyone to be suffering from
[1:02:09] depression in
[1:02:11] America under 1% almost negligible the
[1:02:14] amount of people that actually suffered
[1:02:16] from major depressive disorder or
[1:02:19] whatever they want to call it now in
[1:02:22] America we have 15% of the young people
[1:02:25] aged 12 to 17 and 8% of adults that are
[1:02:29] suffering from major depressive order
[1:02:32] and now they tell us one in five
[1:02:35] Americans suffer from a me mental
[1:02:38] illness 70% of Americans suffer from
[1:02:42] some form of
[1:02:44] anxiety this is the age the neurotic age
[1:02:49] that brother brandham told us about and
[1:02:51] it's only increasing now it's it's very
[1:02:55] strange
[1:02:56] that the awareness of Psych Psychiatry
[1:02:59] and mental illness has gone up
[1:03:01] exponentially and the occurrences of
[1:03:04] mental illness has gone up
[1:03:06] exponentially
[1:03:09] wow this is demonic forces breaking out
[1:03:13] upon the people and the ultimate purpose
[1:03:17] of this is to prevent people from
[1:03:20] repenting and turning to Christ and
[1:03:23] living for him amen it is a spiritual
[1:03:28] war the devil does not want to be C
[1:03:32] Christ to be manifested in his people
[1:03:34] again and he's sending every demonic
[1:03:37] Force against us and though the world is
[1:03:40] being impacted by it the purpose of it
[1:03:43] is to hinder
[1:03:45] us and I want to say especially the
[1:03:48] younger
[1:03:51] Generations uh my kids and th those
[1:03:54] those ones that are in their 20s 30
[1:03:57] early 30s and and under this is a scorge
[1:04:03] upon mankind that has
[1:04:07] happened
[1:04:09] Beyond this specific atmosphere of
[1:04:13] mental health
[1:04:16] awareness uh the enemy has created a
[1:04:19] world that
[1:04:20] creates a great deal of Uncertain
[1:04:23] certainty after Co it's very clear that
[1:04:26] the government is continuously and
[1:04:29] constantly deceiving the public it's not
[1:04:32] hard you don't have to be a conspiracy
[1:04:33] theorist anymore to understand this I'll
[1:04:36] leave it at that social media leads to
[1:04:39] fear of missing out and anxiety over not
[1:04:42] having the perfect life just like so and
[1:04:45] so has the perfect life perfect example
[1:04:48] is recently uh there was a woman who did
[1:04:51] a Tik Tok and she was crying over the
[1:04:53] fact that she uh had to make a cake for
[1:04:56] herself cuz she was a single
[1:04:58] mom and I had to make a cake for my own
[1:05:01] birthday and she's crying on the Tik
[1:05:04] Tock weeping cuz that way my kids can be
[1:05:08] happy and for singing Happy Birthday to
[1:05:10] me her H her ex-husband comes on and
[1:05:13] says this woman doesn't even have
[1:05:15] custody of the our
[1:05:18] children then everybody comes along and
[1:05:20] says this guy is
[1:05:21] abusive oh my they're all nuts
[1:05:28] this is social media that is social
[1:05:30] media that is social media it is a front
[1:05:34] it's not
[1:05:35] real no not well some people do but no
[1:05:39] it not everyone's posting every meal
[1:05:41] that that they're having some people eat
[1:05:43] craft macaroni and
[1:05:46] cheese some people eat ramen
[1:05:49] noodles some people they've got to stay
[1:05:51] home and work believe it or not
[1:05:58] you can't just be on continual vacation
[1:06:01] very rare people that do that even
[1:06:04] retired people sometimes stay
[1:06:07] home and don't even get dressed for that
[1:06:09] day it's not very
[1:06:11] glamorous but we think oh everything is
[1:06:14] just man amazing and uh if we don't have
[1:06:17] oh so and so's here that that one's over
[1:06:20] here my heart's palpitating why why
[1:06:23] don't I ever get this yeah you're in a
[1:06:28] delusion we're in a this is a it's a
[1:06:31] fake created World a good things can
[1:06:34] come of it
[1:06:35] certainly
[1:06:36] but what what the devil does within our
[1:06:39] minds is
[1:06:42] dangerous young people use their phones
[1:06:44] to bully one another things they would
[1:06:46] never say face to face they
[1:06:48] say uh on the phone old people use their
[1:06:51] phones to troll and mock one another
[1:06:56] and and so no wonder we're living in
[1:06:59] such an atmosphere but then it even gets
[1:07:01] worse that's just that's just on that
[1:07:04] level amen now we have to have a hyper
[1:07:09] awareness and we have to diagnose
[1:07:11] ourselves with mental health health
[1:07:14] issues and we have to be fixated on am I
[1:07:18] happy I'm am I happy am I I don't think
[1:07:22] I'm happy
[1:07:26] okay and we're fixated on it as though
[1:07:28] it is an end and of it in and of
[1:07:31] itself everyone's gives themselves their
[1:07:34] own diagnosis I'm this I'm that you're
[1:07:37] identifying yourself with a diagnosis
[1:07:40] based on Tik Tock Facebook re article
[1:07:45] you read a social worker you talked to
[1:07:47] your friend who is really well educated
[1:07:50] in psychiatrist and
[1:07:52] Psychiatry and again I'm not here here
[1:07:56] to put blame on any individual person
[1:07:59] people want to
[1:08:01] help but unless it's by the word we have
[1:08:04] a
[1:08:05] problem and we're going to be back with
[1:08:07] a
[1:08:10] problem Oh
[1:08:14] My and we identify ourselves as such and
[1:08:20] such I'm
[1:08:22] a this I'm ADHD I'm this I'm that I have
[1:08:29] PTSD I have this and we go on and on you
[1:08:34] are not your diagnosis you are not that
[1:08:38] thing you are not your you are not the
[1:08:42] depression you are not the anxiety It's
[1:08:44] actually an
[1:08:46] enemy that you have to battle
[1:08:50] against and then this is the atmosphere
[1:08:54] the world has then we offer you a
[1:08:56] solution go to a
[1:08:57] therapist and again they want to help
[1:09:00] and in some cases they
[1:09:03] can but often uh the therapist
[1:09:06] encourages the people to ruminate and
[1:09:09] think about and never really move on
[1:09:12] from what happened amen the public
[1:09:15] school hospital social workers will ask
[1:09:19] questions that lead people down a
[1:09:21] deceitful
[1:09:23] Road and they're trying to help
[1:09:25] but the deceitful road
[1:09:29] is I'm seeking after this ever elusive
[1:09:34] happiness that we're supposed to live in
[1:09:36] all the time right amen even on Apple
[1:09:40] Health open up your Apple Health app and
[1:09:41] they'll ask you what's your state of
[1:09:49] mind and we should think about our
[1:09:53] thoughts and we should identify
[1:09:55] ourselves with our thoughts if you know
[1:09:57] how the devil works you should know how
[1:09:59] dangerous that is the devil speaks to
[1:10:03] us into our
[1:10:05] minds and so we have to be careful to
[1:10:08] remember that at all
[1:10:11] times if it's against the word it's not
[1:10:14] of God it's from the
[1:10:17] devil
[1:10:20] and now we've produced a generation in
[1:10:24] the into the workforce
[1:10:26] that they have to take time off for
[1:10:27] mental
[1:10:28] health oh I'm just I can't get any work
[1:10:31] done because I've just got some mental
[1:10:33] health issues I'm dealing
[1:10:35] with okay real or
[1:10:37] perceived it's real
[1:10:41] okay it's real but it's because there's
[1:10:43] a there is a worldview and an
[1:10:46] overarching system that Satan has put in
[1:10:48] place that is deceiving
[1:10:52] people you you if if if they if you go
[1:10:56] to the hospital and if there's any
[1:10:58] concern that there's mental health
[1:11:00] issues they give the the National
[1:11:03] Institute of Mental Health gives the
[1:11:05] practitioners a list of questions to go
[1:11:08] through I don't even want to read them
[1:11:10] because there's kids here but they want
[1:11:12] to and if it's a kid they will separate
[1:11:14] that kid from their parents parents go
[1:11:16] away now I'm going to ask you about
[1:11:19] these very dark thoughts that you may or
[1:11:22] may not be having well I didn't have
[1:11:23] them before but now I do
[1:11:28] and maybe they were struggling many
[1:11:30] young people are because of the
[1:11:32] atmosphere that they're put in and that
[1:11:34] they're raised under and this this uh
[1:11:38] situation is not just at school it's not
[1:11:41] just on Tik Tok is how parents are
[1:11:43] raising their children as well and we
[1:11:46] have to be careful not to fall for pop
[1:11:50] psychology nonsense
[1:11:55] you know a CH child having dark thoughts
[1:11:58] that would get these five questions
[1:12:00] asked for them would have the seeds
[1:12:03] planted in their minds for even darker
[1:12:05] and worse
[1:12:07] thoughts
[1:12:09] and when they're in therapy and when
[1:12:12] they're with social workers and even
[1:12:15] sometimes as parents there's this need
[1:12:18] they're constantly indoctrinated to
[1:12:21] think about how they
[1:12:23] feel and that any things off you're not
[1:12:26] happy there's a problem and parents
[1:12:29] raise their children oh my kid's not
[1:12:31] happy well when I was growing up I
[1:12:33] wasn't even consulted about much of
[1:12:38] anything I was told what's going to
[1:12:43] happen and you know I don't think we
[1:12:45] should
[1:12:46] be uh disconnected from how our children
[1:12:50] are feeling however we shouldn't be
[1:12:53] governed by how they're feeling and
[1:12:54] that's the that's the problem that we're
[1:12:57] facing with is everything must be
[1:12:58] governed by how I'm feeling and what my
[1:13:01] mental health situation is well what if
[1:13:03] the whole
[1:13:05] picture of what mental health means is
[1:13:09] perverted and is of Satan what if that
[1:13:12] whole teaching about that is not of
[1:13:16] God what if God has a different program
[1:13:20] amen
[1:13:25] our our feelings how we feel about
[1:13:28] something becomes our
[1:13:31] absolute becomes our final
[1:13:35] Authority raise children based upon how
[1:13:37] they feel things like spanking or making
[1:13:41] decisions on their behalf that's
[1:13:45] abusive I'm
[1:13:47] traumatized because my mom spank me I am
[1:13:49] not
[1:13:50] traumatized because my mom spanked
[1:13:54] me brother Charles say many times his
[1:13:56] mom spanked
[1:13:57] him and and he was spanked probably a
[1:14:00] lot harsher than I was
[1:14:02] spanked and and we thank the Lord
[1:14:06] because these things of discipline and
[1:14:08] consequences for our actions are are
[1:14:10] critical and this is not about raising
[1:14:13] children but I guess I'll just say it is
[1:14:16] children we have boundaries children's
[1:14:19] need boundaries as well and if they
[1:14:20] cross cross them they have to first have
[1:14:25] this kind of consequence and as they get
[1:14:26] older the natural
[1:14:28] consequence instead we deliver them from
[1:14:30] everything because God got to be is my
[1:14:32] child
[1:14:33] happy are they H oh again there's
[1:14:37] nothing wrong with knowing that but
[1:14:40] there is a problem when that's how we
[1:14:41] govern
[1:14:44] everything instead of seeking up to
[1:14:47] raise them in the way they should
[1:14:50] go we raise them up with a false
[1:14:55] understanding of even what produces
[1:15:00] happiness if they want to wear makeup if
[1:15:02] they want to get earrings they want to
[1:15:04] disrespect mom Ah that's fine makes
[1:15:08] they're they're happy you know it's not
[1:15:11] going to work for this Dad disrespect
[1:15:14] mom nope it's not
[1:15:17] happening if they want to disobey their
[1:15:21] consequences regardless of tears and
[1:15:23] sorrow and sadness be sad be sorrowful
[1:15:26] Godly sorrow leads to
[1:15:31] repentance and we can't deliver our
[1:15:34] children from all consequences but
[1:15:36] that's what this therapeutic approach to
[1:15:40] raising children has done deliver them
[1:15:42] from consequences do everything for
[1:15:45] them let them dictate everything in the
[1:15:47] home because their happiness is our
[1:15:50] absolute
[1:15:52] okay well what what is this produced
[1:15:55] we can see the fruit of it oh yeah the
[1:15:58] first generation in America of children
[1:16:00] raised so incredibly gently and what do
[1:16:04] they do they hate their
[1:16:06] parents because of all the terrible
[1:16:09] childhood trauma that they
[1:16:11] faced they had the PS4 not the
[1:16:19] PS5 they they gave me craft macaroni and
[1:16:22] cheese they didn't take me out for sushi
[1:16:25] every day what I
[1:16:27] wanted they're spoiled rotten that's the
[1:16:30] problem they didn't get a
[1:16:36] spanking it's the first generation of
[1:16:39] children that don't want to have
[1:16:40] children can you imagine that they don't
[1:16:44] want to have children and they mock
[1:16:46] people that do want to have children why
[1:16:48] would you want to have children you were
[1:16:51] raised so gently it should be the should
[1:16:53] have been the greatest experience of
[1:16:54] your life
[1:16:55] right children raised with all kinds of
[1:17:00] psychotherapy have become a generation
[1:17:02] of young adults full of Despair in the
[1:17:04] most unhappiest and depressed
[1:17:06] Generations
[1:17:09] ever young adults are not prepared for
[1:17:11] jobs to live on their own or to be
[1:17:14] responsible even in the remotest way
[1:17:18] they need safe safe spaces and time off
[1:17:21] to take care of their mental
[1:17:23] health and I I don't want want to
[1:17:25] denigrate anyone that might be raised in
[1:17:28] this situation and that are facing these
[1:17:31] things God has a Deliverance but you
[1:17:33] have to repent and you have to come and
[1:17:36] look at this situation the way God looks
[1:17:38] at it and not the way you've been taught
[1:17:41] and uh indoctrinated to look at
[1:17:47] it they've been taught and and you can't
[1:17:50] blame them they've been taught and it's
[1:17:52] been emphasized you have to
[1:17:54] considerately constantly consider your
[1:17:57] mental health and your state of
[1:17:58] happiness and you have to allow your
[1:18:01] feelings to dictate the terms of
[1:18:04] everything in other words they've been
[1:18:06] taught to be led by their human Spirit
[1:18:09] which is governed by the desires of the
[1:18:12] Flesh and this overarching approach to
[1:18:15] life causes them to see everything
[1:18:18] Through The Eyes of
[1:18:20] victimhood and a lack of personal
[1:18:23] responsibility amen
[1:18:25] amen I want to look and
[1:18:28] examine
[1:18:30] Ecclesiastes for a little
[1:18:32] bit because I think this directly has to
[1:18:35] do with the situation we find oursel in
[1:18:44] today Ecclesiastes 1 vers one the words
[1:18:47] of the preacher the son of David King in
[1:18:51] Jerusalem vanity of vanity sayeth the
[1:18:53] preacher vanity of vanities
[1:18:56] all is
[1:19:00] Vanity what prophet hath a man of all
[1:19:02] his labor which he takes Under the
[1:19:08] Sun the word
[1:19:10] vanity in Hebrew means
[1:19:13] emptiness it figuratively means
[1:19:16] something transitory or unsatisfactory
[1:19:20] the word vain means empty worthless
[1:19:23] pointless lacking value unsatisfying
[1:19:27] amen so understand God made everything
[1:19:30] good he didn't intend for work to be
[1:19:32] vanity he didn't tend for companionship
[1:19:35] to be vanity he didn't intend for
[1:19:38] anything to be meaningless but because
[1:19:41] of
[1:19:42] sin things have become vanity things
[1:19:45] have become
[1:19:47] vain God made everything
[1:19:50] good and when everything was completed
[1:19:52] he said it was very
[1:19:55] good but
[1:19:57] sin marred it and now things are vain
[1:20:01] the Bible says it's made subject to
[1:20:03] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:20:07] him who subjected the same in
[1:20:11] hope so even even the the what the
[1:20:14] meaninglessness that you find God was
[1:20:16] going to turn around and and and solve
[1:20:18] all that so I want to look at this word
[1:20:22] in the sense of meaning
[1:20:25] L when you say vanity of vanities it's
[1:20:29] talking about meaning or purpose it's
[1:20:32] meaningless so why is it
[1:20:36] meaningless Jeremiah 179 the heart is
[1:20:38] deceitful above all things and
[1:20:41] desperately wicked who can know
[1:20:44] it so because of sin our heart is
[1:20:49] governed by evil desires and those evil
[1:20:53] desires do what what we cause us to seek
[1:20:57] after pleasure for the sake of pleasure
[1:21:02] itself let's look further in
[1:21:05] Ecclesiastes all things verse eight All
[1:21:09] Things Are full of Labor man cannot
[1:21:11] utter it the eye is not satisfied with
[1:21:14] seeing nor the ear filled with hearing
[1:21:18] verse 13 and I gave my heart to seek and
[1:21:21] search out by wisdom concerning all
[1:21:23] things that are done under
[1:21:26] Heaven this sore travail hath God given
[1:21:29] to the sons of man to be exercised
[1:21:32] therewith so
[1:21:34] what Solomon is saying here is my
[1:21:39] conclusion of looking at everything I've
[1:21:41] done is Vanity of vanity so he's
[1:21:43] starting with his conclusion but he's
[1:21:46] going to then go through the Book of
[1:21:48] Ecclesiastes and tell you how he arrived
[1:21:50] at that point amen so first he's saying
[1:21:55] I became a
[1:21:57] scholar I'm studying everything under
[1:22:00] heaven to become an expert at
[1:22:03] it I have seen all the works that are
[1:22:05] done under the sun and behold all is
[1:22:09] Vanity and vexation of spirit I commune
[1:22:12] with my own heart saying Lo I'm come to
[1:22:14] Great Estate I'm very wealthy and I've
[1:22:16] have gotten more wisdom than all they
[1:22:19] that have been before me in Jerusalem
[1:22:20] yay my heart had great experience of
[1:22:23] wisdom and knowledge and I gave my heart
[1:22:25] to no wisdom and to no Madness and Folly
[1:22:28] I perceived that this also is vexation
[1:22:31] of spirit for in much wisdom is much
[1:22:34] grief and he that increases knowledge
[1:22:37] increases
[1:22:39] sorrow so here he's trying to find
[1:22:42] meaning in wisdom and he Fe finds out as
[1:22:47] he studies every natural thing he comes
[1:22:51] to the end is this is Vanity and
[1:22:53] vexation of spirit
[1:22:55] it Ecclesiastes 2:1 I said in my heart
[1:22:58] go to now I will prove thee with mirth
[1:23:01] therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this
[1:23:04] also is Vanity so he said okay now I'm
[1:23:07] going to seek after every pleasure that
[1:23:09] I can possibly seek after and what is
[1:23:12] the result what did I find
[1:23:14] out it's vanity it's
[1:23:17] meaningless I said of laughter it's mad
[1:23:20] and of Mirth what does it do
[1:23:24] I sought in my heart to give myself un
[1:23:26] wine yet acquainting my heart with
[1:23:28] wisdom and to lay hold on to Folly till
[1:23:30] I might see what was good for the sons
[1:23:32] of man which they should do under he the
[1:23:35] heaven all the days of their life thank
[1:23:37] you Solomon we don't have to figure that
[1:23:39] out yourself everybody Solomon has
[1:23:41] already discovered that drinking too
[1:23:43] much
[1:23:45] alcohol is no
[1:23:49] good he was way richer than you he was
[1:23:52] richer than the richest people on the
[1:23:54] planet planet today he had everything
[1:23:56] that he could possibly dream of and
[1:23:58] Beyond and his results are as this is
[1:24:04] crazy I made me great works I builded me
[1:24:07] houses I planted me Vineyards I made me
[1:24:10] Gardens and Orchards I planted trees in
[1:24:12] them of all kinds of fruits I made me
[1:24:15] pools of water to water there with now
[1:24:17] you think it's just this he he literally
[1:24:19] made lakes that fed into lakes which fed
[1:24:21] into lakes and he surrounded them by
[1:24:23] with fruit
[1:24:25] uh uh fruit uh Orchards so that those
[1:24:28] pools of water would then uh feed in and
[1:24:32] water the the
[1:24:36] trees he bought
[1:24:38] slaves and maidens he had servants born
[1:24:41] in his house he had POS great
[1:24:44] possessions of Great and Small cattle
[1:24:46] above all that were in Jerusalem before
[1:24:49] me I gathered me also silver and gold
[1:24:51] and the peculiar Treasure of kings and
[1:24:54] of the provinces i g me men singers and
[1:24:56] women singers and the Delights of the
[1:24:58] sons of man as musical instruments and
[1:25:01] that of All Sorts he got the best
[1:25:03] musicians he got the best music he got
[1:25:05] the he got the best farming he got the
[1:25:07] best uh uh uh Orchards he got the best
[1:25:12] slaves he got the most wives he got the
[1:25:15] most
[1:25:16] concubines I mean what else could he do
[1:25:19] he got the best
[1:25:21] wine what was the results
[1:25:25] so I was great and increased more than
[1:25:26] all that were before me in Jerusalem
[1:25:28] also my wisdom remained with me and
[1:25:32] whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not
[1:25:34] from them I withheld not my heart from
[1:25:37] any joy for my heart rejoice in all my
[1:25:39] labor and this was the portion of all my
[1:25:43] labor then I looked on all the works of
[1:25:45] my hands that my hands had wrought and
[1:25:47] on the labor that I had labored to do
[1:25:49] and behold all was vanity and vexation
[1:25:51] of spirit and there was no profit
[1:25:54] Under the
[1:25:57] Sun for what what hath man of all his
[1:26:00] labor and the vexation of his heart
[1:26:01] wherein Heath labored Under the Sun for
[1:26:04] all his days are sorrows and his travail
[1:26:06] grief yay his heart takes not rest in
[1:26:09] the night this also is Vanity so we see
[1:26:15] seeking after Happiness by becoming a
[1:26:18] scholar it's vanity seeking after
[1:26:20] happiness that's the end that we're
[1:26:22] talking about
[1:26:24] it's it's not saying that there's
[1:26:26] there's there's no good in work there's
[1:26:29] no good in
[1:26:31] wisdom he's saying seeking after that to
[1:26:34] find meaning by seeking after that is
[1:26:40] meaningless seeking after Happiness by
[1:26:43] by going after Central pleasure sex food
[1:26:46] alcohol he says it's vanity
[1:26:50] am seeking ha H Happiness by giving
[1:26:53] yourself over to work work completely
[1:26:57] vanity of course Solomon encourages
[1:26:59] finding wisdom he encourages working he
[1:27:02] en encourages enjoying the the fruits of
[1:27:05] your work good food nice home Etc he
[1:27:09] encourages finding companionship but he
[1:27:11] discourages us from seeking to find
[1:27:14] meaning in them as an end in and of
[1:27:19] themselves let's look at the Tanakh oh I
[1:27:23] didn't include it did
[1:27:26] I let me
[1:27:29] see no I'm going to read directly from
[1:27:32] Ecclesiastes 12 13 and 14 this is
[1:27:38] what conclusion Solomon comes to the end
[1:27:40] of the matter all having been heard so
[1:27:44] this is the results of all his searching
[1:27:47] all his studying all his examination
[1:27:49] what is it the end of the matter fear
[1:27:52] God and keep his Commandments for this
[1:27:56] is the whole man for God shall bring
[1:27:59] every work into the Judgment concerning
[1:28:01] every hidden thing whether it be good or
[1:28:03] whether it be evil now in the KJV it
[1:28:06] says the whole duty of man and many
[1:28:09] other translations say the whole duty of
[1:28:11] man but the Hebrew doesn't include the
[1:28:13] word
[1:28:15] duty this says this is the
[1:28:18] whole man in other words the whole man
[1:28:22] is what what is his purpose what did God
[1:28:25] Place us here for to fear God and to
[1:28:28] keep his Commandments this is the whole
[1:28:31] man so if a if you want to be a whole
[1:28:34] person what should you do fear God and
[1:28:38] keep his
[1:28:39] Commandments that is man's purpose that
[1:28:42] is man's function that is the place that
[1:28:45] man finds his meaning when he himself is
[1:28:48] wrapped up in the purpose of God that's
[1:28:52] where he finds happiness you never will
[1:28:54] find happiness by seeking after
[1:28:57] happiness how many times have you
[1:28:59] thought that new pair of shoes you need
[1:29:02] to get that new laptop that you work so
[1:29:06] hard and saved for you'll become happy
[1:29:09] that new piano then I'll be happy and
[1:29:13] it's like sand you're grabbing sand with
[1:29:16] your fingers open where is it where is
[1:29:19] that happiness happiness is not coming
[1:29:22] from things happiness is not coming from
[1:29:26] situations in life I've seen people
[1:29:29] who've had the most miserable lives be
[1:29:33] the happiest people that I've ever
[1:29:38] met and we all know in our
[1:29:41] society we we have so much stuff we have
[1:29:45] so much wealth and people are not
[1:29:48] happy if the if if if the if having
[1:29:52] stuff and having the best food and the
[1:29:54] best whatever resulted in happiness then
[1:29:57] we would be overflowing With It in
[1:29:59] America but we are
[1:30:00] not then they'd be overflowing with it
[1:30:03] in Europe they're not either we're the
[1:30:06] most
[1:30:07] depressed Society on
[1:30:11] Earth it isn't the ones that are poor
[1:30:14] that are the most
[1:30:16] depressed they have their struggles too
[1:30:19] everyone does but what is it when we
[1:30:22] have taught every everyone to seek after
[1:30:26] happiness as the end and of itself and
[1:30:29] is the most important thing we have
[1:30:31] destroyed the minds of
[1:30:33] people and until they get the Holy Ghost
[1:30:36] and their mind is even baptized with the
[1:30:39] Holy Ghost they can never really come to
[1:30:43] that place of peace and contentment amen
[1:30:47] I encourage everyone to listen to the
[1:30:49] sermon life in
[1:30:51] 1957 by brother brandham I'm going to
[1:30:53] read an extensive quote from this and
[1:30:56] I'm doing that and taking up time to do
[1:30:59] that because it is absolutely incredible
[1:31:02] and perfect along with what we're
[1:31:03] talking
[1:31:05] about all right if we're and I don't
[1:31:08] bring it up there because um I want I
[1:31:10] want to take my time he says if we're
[1:31:14] rejoicing over the world and the evil
[1:31:16] things our minds and our souls are
[1:31:18] inspired by below Boogie woggie dances
[1:31:22] heart heartaches drinking and all these
[1:31:24] other things that we run after it's from
[1:31:27] below but if we rejoice in the spirit
[1:31:31] that we have eternal life and we raise
[1:31:32] our emotions to God and praise him then
[1:31:35] we have joy then we have joy Jesus said
[1:31:38] that your Joys might be full but not
[1:31:40] full of the perverted life but full of
[1:31:43] eternal life above so you can see it
[1:31:46] depends on what you look at now just for
[1:31:49] instance for the psychology part of it
[1:31:50] psychiatric now let's notice just a
[1:31:52] moment the psych view here is the
[1:31:55] picture of Christ and here is an
[1:31:56] electric fan it depends on which one I
[1:31:59] look at see if my emotions is moved this
[1:32:02] way or my emotions is moved that way if
[1:32:05] I look at that and long for that and
[1:32:08] desire that my emotions is set towards
[1:32:11] the
[1:32:12] fan but if I look this way my emotions
[1:32:15] and desires is set that way that's the
[1:32:18] reason Jesus said whoever whosoever
[1:32:20] lookth upon a woman to lust after her
[1:32:22] has committed adultery with already in
[1:32:24] his heart see it's where your emotions
[1:32:27] is set where your thought is and then we
[1:32:31] can Rejoice on because that we are
[1:32:33] children of the promise on that great
[1:32:36] Eternal Church of God who has Christ's
[1:32:37] own promise it can't fail that's right
[1:32:40] the world thinks we're crazy oh this is
[1:32:44] life
[1:32:45] whoee remember that story that brother
[1:32:47] bham
[1:32:50] tells women half-dressed drunk drunk and
[1:32:53] partying and so this is life my
[1:32:56] goodness he said I'm this this day to
[1:32:59] see a young lady who went to a
[1:33:00] psychiatrist she's 35 years old never
[1:33:03] smoked never drank in all her life a
[1:33:04] very fine girl her people are Christians
[1:33:07] her father is a doctor and she she gave
[1:33:10] her life to Christ in the early stage
[1:33:12] and what did she do she goes out and she
[1:33:14] finally gets to a place to a college
[1:33:16] where she was teaching and a
[1:33:18] psychiatrist there he sit down to talk
[1:33:19] to her and he said do you mean that you
[1:33:21] never been kissed by a boy she said not
[1:33:24] one time in all my life you mean you've
[1:33:26] never had a little drink and been in a
[1:33:28] party never said girl you don't know
[1:33:31] what you're missing now him being a
[1:33:33] psychiatrist he swung the girl's mind
[1:33:36] until now she has become so evil and so
[1:33:38] bad till she don't even want to hear the
[1:33:40] name of Jesus spoke to her in her
[1:33:43] presence and even her father and mother
[1:33:44] can't even see her no more and she has
[1:33:47] lost her mind and this next week will'll
[1:33:49] go to the institution for shock
[1:33:51] treatment it's because that she turned
[1:33:53] her thought thoughts from Christ unto
[1:33:55] what that
[1:33:56] psychiatrist was moving her
[1:33:59] mind and that's what we're here for this
[1:34:01] morning is to move your mind and your
[1:34:03] thinking from the things of the world
[1:34:05] unto the things of God which is
[1:34:07] eternally and that's what preaching is
[1:34:09] for is to pervert the thinking to a
[1:34:12] higher and better and to the place where
[1:34:15] Christ is until you become converted
[1:34:18] then your mind reaches for those things
[1:34:19] which are
[1:34:21] above now but life in this other Place
[1:34:24] gets to this girl they're thinking she
[1:34:25] might take poison at any time sure life
[1:34:29] becomes so miserable that type of life
[1:34:32] until they kill themselves take poison
[1:34:34] and everything now but God in his great
[1:34:37] economy for mankind has made man in the
[1:34:40] way that he wanted man to be he made him
[1:34:42] to thirst now you see another place that
[1:34:45] he's getting to first he's talking about
[1:34:47] where is your F Focus where is your mind
[1:34:50] going now he's coming on why is that
[1:34:53] important because he made us to
[1:34:55] thirst and you see that this
[1:34:58] poor
[1:35:00] girl I'm I'm just going to dramatize in
[1:35:03] a minute she grows up in a Christian
[1:35:05] Christian home her parents are godly
[1:35:09] people she goes off to the university
[1:35:12] she begins to take some college courses
[1:35:15] and in the college courses they they
[1:35:17] bring her to a teacher who turns her
[1:35:20] mind around on psychology and using
[1:35:24] psychology attacks her Christian
[1:35:28] virtue and because now he sets her mind
[1:35:31] on a different way of thinking and
[1:35:33] approaching life right now what what's
[1:35:37] happened she's gone on into depression
[1:35:40] so what good was the learning about
[1:35:43] Psychiatry she was fine to begin with
[1:35:47] she went to learn this other way what is
[1:35:49] it science civilization education are
[1:35:53] all of the devil and brother Bram says
[1:35:55] it's making the people like
[1:36:04] ragweeds all
[1:36:06] right did you notice what David said
[1:36:09] here said my soul thirsts for thee oh I
[1:36:12] love that as in a dry lands where
[1:36:14] there's no water just imagine said my
[1:36:15] soul is so thirsty God I'm thirsting for
[1:36:17] you just like I was in a land where
[1:36:19] there was no water he must find water or
[1:36:21] perish my soul is thirsting for thee now
[1:36:25] God made Man With The Thirst that's a
[1:36:27] part of the H human being is his thirst
[1:36:29] but God made The Thirst in man to thirst
[1:36:32] for God Amen just what Solomon said obey
[1:36:36] God fear God and keep his
[1:36:39] Commandments made us to thirst for God
[1:36:41] and the devil has perverted it and make
[1:36:44] it a thirst for his kingdom for the
[1:36:46] world do you get it The Thirst in man is
[1:36:48] Godly for God made the man to thirst but
[1:36:52] thirst for God amen and how dare some of
[1:36:55] you would be so little to try to quench
[1:36:57] that blessed thing of Thirst by trying
[1:36:59] to satisfy that with drinking and
[1:37:02] smoking and television and running and
[1:37:04] carrying on and reveling around trying
[1:37:06] to satisfy that Godly thing that God put
[1:37:08] in you to thirst for him you are
[1:37:11] polluting the fountain that God has
[1:37:12] placed in you to receive his spirit and
[1:37:15] you're drowning it with the things of
[1:37:16] the world and they do not satisfy and
[1:37:19] they will never
[1:37:21] satisfy and that's the reason you put
[1:37:23] put a pistol to your brains to blow them
[1:37:25] out is because that things that go go
[1:37:27] the way they do and the world is on the
[1:37:29] great suicide and a perversion and a
[1:37:31] homosexual and the crime is in the land
[1:37:33] the way it is is because you're
[1:37:35] perverting the very thing that God give
[1:37:37] you and trying to satisfy it with the
[1:37:39] evil of this
[1:37:40] world take that blessed holy spirit that
[1:37:43] God placed The Thirst in your soul to
[1:37:45] call for and you satisfy it with an the
[1:37:47] nightclub
[1:37:49] somewhere no wonder you got a headache
[1:37:51] the next morning you'll take a case of
[1:37:53] beard and go to your house and sit down
[1:37:55] and drink it try to satisfy that Godly
[1:37:57] thirst that God put in your soul to
[1:37:59] thirst after him and take the devil's
[1:38:02] slop and try to satisfy The Thirst that
[1:38:04] God put in you to thirst after him how
[1:38:06] can you receive anything but Eternal
[1:38:08] separation from the presence of almighty
[1:38:10] God when he made you to thirst after him
[1:38:13] and David surrendered himself and said
[1:38:15] my th soul is thirsting like I was in a
[1:38:17] dry land where there's no water I thirst
[1:38:19] for thee Oh god there you are David said
[1:38:21] I seen thee in thy sanctuary and my soul
[1:38:23] Soul thirst for that power there you are
[1:38:25] that's the difference that's what makes
[1:38:27] the difference is The Thirst that God
[1:38:29] give you is you satisfy it with
[1:38:32] water all right now again I'm going to
[1:38:36] repeat what brother Matthew brought this
[1:38:38] morning is sometimes we're satisfying
[1:38:42] that thirst it's not so black and white
[1:38:45] we're not watching pornography we're not
[1:38:48] watching some something horrible but
[1:38:51] we're watching something that is not
[1:38:52] Redeeming the the time it's just for the
[1:38:55] pure sake of
[1:38:57] entertainment now is it is it okay to
[1:39:01] watch things for the sake of
[1:39:03] entertainment if it's a Godly thing I
[1:39:05] think so but when that becomes the
[1:39:08] focus when we focus on the game when we
[1:39:12] focus on another thing besides on Christ
[1:39:17] we're going after happiness from
[1:39:19] something that is like sand seeping
[1:39:21] through our fingers
[1:39:24] we're we're never to try to satisfy our
[1:39:27] thirst with the things of the
[1:39:30] world even if it's something that is
[1:39:34] maybe in the middle and it's not so
[1:39:36] bad even that can be bad because it
[1:39:40] isn't the right thing it's a thing it
[1:39:43] might be bad it might be good but it
[1:39:45] isn't the thing that we're supposed to
[1:39:47] be going after the person that we're
[1:39:50] going after
[1:39:53] Satan has inserted something into this
[1:39:56] generation to pollute it so terribly we
[1:39:59] cannot even stand another generation to
[1:40:02] go
[1:40:03] further where we've come
[1:40:05] to the world's atmosphere young people
[1:40:08] are raised in the entertainment World
[1:40:12] plunges them into
[1:40:14] this garbage pop psychology it blames
[1:40:18] everything on the parents it breaks
[1:40:20] relationships and ruins homes leads them
[1:40:22] further in despair this is the world
[1:40:26] that our kids are surrounded by it's
[1:40:29] Satan's Gospel of
[1:40:33] psychology in the classroom in the home
[1:40:35] on social
[1:40:37] media let's focus on our mental health
[1:40:40] to the point where we're crippled by it
[1:40:43] you know that's you realize that that's
[1:40:45] what's happening you have focused on you
[1:40:49] to the point where you are crippled by
[1:40:51] you
[1:41:00] how could you ever find happiness by
[1:41:05] trying to I found happy you know I've
[1:41:07] really achieved Victory I'm I'm Tony
[1:41:10] Robbins I F I found Happiness by
[1:41:12] focusing on my happiness you know i'
[1:41:16] I've been a stay-at-home mom and I
[1:41:17] really been focused on you know serving
[1:41:20] my husband and my children but you know
[1:41:22] I decided I decided I'm going to focus
[1:41:24] on me and everybody's like you go
[1:41:29] girl come
[1:41:31] on really they do you've seen it I'm
[1:41:36] going to focus on my
[1:41:38] happiness and you're going to become the
[1:41:40] most depressed person that we
[1:41:48] know next we do is we train children to
[1:41:53] find the trauma in their life this
[1:41:57] trauma happened because my dad did this
[1:42:00] this trauma happened because my mom said
[1:42:02] this hey every parent here has made
[1:42:05] mistakes and lots of them there's no
[1:42:07] perfect parent except for our heavenly
[1:42:09] father the rest of us got problems and
[1:42:12] we make mistakes and we say dumb stuff
[1:42:14] and guess what a real child that's
[1:42:16] raised up with the Bible as the absolute
[1:42:19] forgives and moves
[1:42:20] forward I mean you you you hurt your
[1:42:24] six-year-old feelings who they who can
[1:42:26] forgive and love you better than that
[1:42:29] little one it's incredible but what have
[1:42:31] we done we've undone forgiveness we've
[1:42:34] undone deliverance and healing and we've
[1:42:37] caused people to say so un soul is bad
[1:42:39] to me growing up therefore I am like
[1:42:41] this I'm sorry you're not a victim as a
[1:42:44] Christian you are you have victory in
[1:42:46] Christ no matter what somebody did to
[1:42:48] you you don't have to live in bondage to
[1:42:50] what they did to you you are not what
[1:42:53] they did to you you are a son of God or
[1:42:57] a daughter of God you are free and you
[1:43:01] don't have to be haunted by that anymore
[1:43:07] amen I have I have much more to say by
[1:43:10] that but time is getting short and I
[1:43:13] really need to get on to
[1:43:16] Philippians chapter 4 we'll cover that
[1:43:19] those things in the
[1:43:21] next time I preach
[1:43:25] because this is really I want I want to
[1:43:26] spend the last 15 minutes or
[1:43:30] so going on this because this is God's
[1:43:34] remedy
[1:43:38] amen and as I'm approaching this this is
[1:43:41] not just inspiring words this is the
[1:43:43] Bible it's a command to you just as
[1:43:46] Deuteronomy 225 is a command to you this
[1:43:49] is a command to you and I'm just I'm I'm
[1:43:53] trying not to overemphasize this but I
[1:43:55] can overemphasize this is if you want to
[1:43:57] be
[1:43:59] free from the oppression that the enemy
[1:44:01] is putting on on you put this into
[1:44:04] practice you will be free you will have
[1:44:06] Victory and the devil will be running in
[1:44:09] fear from you when you wake up in the
[1:44:12] morning be careful for nothing it
[1:44:16] literally means don't worry about
[1:44:18] anything
[1:44:20] am but in everything by
[1:44:23] prayer and supplication with
[1:44:26] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[1:44:29] known unto God
[1:44:31] so what Paul is speaking about to the
[1:44:34] Philippians in this is
[1:44:37] peace peace is a lot better than
[1:44:42] happiness happiness is elusive sometimes
[1:44:45] I'm happy sometimes I'm not the more I
[1:44:47] think about it the less I
[1:44:51] am that that's really not the end and of
[1:44:54] itself being finding fulfillment or
[1:44:58] peace in Christ is much more
[1:45:03] valuable than being happy happy will
[1:45:05] come and go it's up and down it's here
[1:45:07] and there sometimes we're supposed to be
[1:45:10] sorrowful there's a in in every there's
[1:45:12] a season for
[1:45:14] everything a time to laugh a time to
[1:45:16] mourn all of these things is part of the
[1:45:19] human condition you're not supposed to
[1:45:21] cry at a wedding you're supposed to cry
[1:45:23] at a funeral these are different things
[1:45:25] that we go through it's it's it's normal
[1:45:27] we've all experienced it on some level
[1:45:30] or another in different ways that's
[1:45:33] normal but you can find
[1:45:36] peace and
[1:45:39] meaning real purpose no matter the
[1:45:42] circumstances now the devil will try to
[1:45:44] take that away from you that's why we
[1:45:45] need
[1:45:47] this do not worry about
[1:45:50] everything pray about everything yeah so
[1:45:53] we have two things going on they're both
[1:45:55] in the mind and they're both done in
[1:45:57] secret
[1:45:59] place and they're both engaging actually
[1:46:01] the same thing the soul Faith or
[1:46:06] unbelief Faith or
[1:46:09] unbelief what is what is worrying is
[1:46:12] simply
[1:46:13] unbelief it's seeing circumstances and
[1:46:16] engaging in your imagination in unbelief
[1:46:20] towards the
[1:46:21] circumstances and then you feed that and
[1:46:24] then it becomes a pattern and then
[1:46:26] there's a well-worn pattern in your
[1:46:28] brain of worry anxiety and fear I am a
[1:46:32] worrier would you shut up
[1:46:36] devil are you identifying as a
[1:46:42] sinner as you are you're identifying I'm
[1:46:44] an
[1:46:46] unbeliever I'm sorry I'm not doing that
[1:46:50] anymore don't worry about anything if is
[1:46:53] a command from the word of God so when
[1:46:56] we're engaging and worrying we're
[1:46:58] disobeying our heavenly
[1:47:00] father so what am I supposed to do
[1:47:02] instead pray about
[1:47:03] it oh that doesn't seem like very uh
[1:47:08] mysterious Revelations coming forth from
[1:47:10] the pulpit pray about it am I don't care
[1:47:14] what it is or what it
[1:47:16] isn't it's very simple worrying engages
[1:47:20] the same thing that prayer does
[1:47:23] just going NE another Direction instead
[1:47:26] of using the
[1:47:28] imagination your your soul right your
[1:47:31] soul that's the nature of your spirit
[1:47:34] it's either Faith or unbelief right and
[1:47:37] that that Soul has inlets it works
[1:47:40] through inlets of the
[1:47:43] spirit and so it uses those inlets and
[1:47:45] so if those are all clogged up by what
[1:47:47] the psychologists and the social justice
[1:47:50] Warriors and the the victim mentality
[1:47:53] and all that stuff is being put before
[1:47:56] you how can
[1:47:58] you not worry about
[1:48:02] anything God go if God says it it's
[1:48:05] brother brandham says this if God says
[1:48:06] it he has to make a way for it to
[1:48:09] be so first get the baptism of the Holy
[1:48:12] Ghost you'll never be able to do this
[1:48:15] without Christ's in you the hope of
[1:48:18] glory so start with that is you need a
[1:48:21] nature change
[1:48:23] if your nature is still the old nature
[1:48:25] and the nature of the world you can use
[1:48:28] psychology good psychology to fix
[1:48:30] yourself but that isn't the transforming
[1:48:33] power of God Amen you can be right back
[1:48:36] in the same position
[1:48:38] later the transforming power of God
[1:48:41] makes us subject to the
[1:48:43] word so pray about everything tell God
[1:48:47] what you need and thank him for what
[1:48:49] he's done
[1:48:53] this is so simple but the reality is the
[1:48:55] devil gets our eyes off of that we start
[1:48:57] to worry this this this this this could
[1:48:59] happen this could go this way what if
[1:49:01] this happens why did this person say
[1:49:02] this why did all these things come to
[1:49:05] our minds stop slow
[1:49:07] down don't
[1:49:10] worry pray amen then trust God and thank
[1:49:15] him that he's given you the answer
[1:49:17] already because he has given you the
[1:49:20] answer all right
[1:49:23] and the peace of
[1:49:25] God or then the peace of God which
[1:49:29] passes all understanding shall keep your
[1:49:31] hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus
[1:49:34] many times I looked at this and saw what
[1:49:37] a what a wonderful verse I want the
[1:49:39] peace of God to that passes all
[1:49:41] understanding to keep me but I forgot
[1:49:43] that it's connected to this verse so you
[1:49:45] can't expect verse seven to come to you
[1:49:48] if you're not doing verse
[1:49:51] six so you verse six verse 7
[1:49:55] comes this is not a magic wand this is
[1:49:58] doing what God has said to said to
[1:50:01] do again I spoke before God Is A Healer
[1:50:04] and a deliverer you come to the platform
[1:50:06] of depression God will heal you you go
[1:50:09] back with the same habits in your mind
[1:50:12] you'll come back again to be delivered
[1:50:14] from depression for something
[1:50:16] else the purpose of the Bride is to come
[1:50:18] to maturity to be Overcomers so that we
[1:50:21] can walk in faith never
[1:50:26] doubting and be delivered and not have
[1:50:28] to experience these things yes ups and
[1:50:32] downs come but we have we have the ammo
[1:50:35] in our gun to fire at the
[1:50:38] Devil it's a peace that passes all
[1:50:41] understanding that means it's a peace
[1:50:43] that actually doesn't even make sense
[1:50:45] considering the
[1:50:47] circumstances and that peace will keep
[1:50:50] your hearts and Minds through Christ
[1:50:52] Christ Jesus he doesn't stop there
[1:50:55] finally
[1:50:58] Brethren finally Brethren whatsoever
[1:51:00] things are true whatsoever things are
[1:51:03] honest whatsoever things are just
[1:51:05] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[1:51:07] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[1:51:09] of a good report if there be any virtue
[1:51:12] and if there be any praise think on
[1:51:15] these
[1:51:18] things so Paul is telling us this is
[1:51:21] what you need to think about if you want
[1:51:24] peace you need to be thinking about the
[1:51:26] right things if you're thinking about
[1:51:28] things with anxiety fear and worry you
[1:51:32] won't have peace
[1:51:33] amen and remember this is not just a
[1:51:37] human thing this is a spiritual battle
[1:51:40] and warfare the devil is trying to rob
[1:51:43] you of Peace he's trying to take away
[1:51:46] your Authority in Christ he's trying to
[1:51:47] make you useless for the kingdom of God
[1:51:51] Amen and and God is giving us tools to
[1:51:54] fight the enemy so we you have to guard
[1:51:57] what your thoughts what you allow
[1:51:59] yourself to think about you can't stop
[1:52:02] the birds from flying by but you can
[1:52:04] keep them from
[1:52:05] roosting we hear that that means you
[1:52:08] control your thought
[1:52:10] life you don't say I have no control
[1:52:13] over
[1:52:14] this if you're in Christ you do if
[1:52:17] you're not in Christ I can agree with
[1:52:19] you but if you're in Christ you have
[1:52:22] control and you you have power and you
[1:52:23] have authority to take dominion over
[1:52:26] your thoughts yes amen those things
[1:52:29] which you have both learned and received
[1:52:33] and heard and seen in
[1:52:35] me do and the God of Peace shall be with
[1:52:40] you and I want you to understand that
[1:52:43] walking in victory has to do with not
[1:52:47] just thinking it's also doing amen amen
[1:52:51] when we sit
[1:52:53] and ruminate about our thoughts and our
[1:52:56] hurts and our pains and what people have
[1:52:58] done to us what ends up happening is
[1:53:02] you're creating an atmosphere around
[1:53:05] yourself of unbelief of bitterness amen
[1:53:09] of
[1:53:10] anger ultimately you become in our
[1:53:14] society today I am the victim of what
[1:53:17] other people did to me and then what's
[1:53:19] the next thing you do you run from
[1:53:20] church to church to find somebody that's
[1:53:22] going to live up to your
[1:53:23] expectations and no one can live up to
[1:53:25] your expectations because your
[1:53:27] expectations are
[1:53:30] wrong because in your mind you're the
[1:53:32] victim you're not an overcomer you're a
[1:53:34] victim so and so did me wrong and so and
[1:53:36] so everybody has been done wrong
[1:53:39] everybody has been hurt in church in the
[1:53:42] nicest church with the nicest people
[1:53:44] someone's going to hurt you okay so what
[1:53:48] what how are you going to handle it yes
[1:53:50] amen are you going to be a victim are
[1:53:51] you going to be a gossip
[1:53:53] or are you going to do what the word
[1:53:55] says Paul says that part of having God's
[1:53:58] peace again it says and the God of Peace
[1:54:01] it could just as well be translated then
[1:54:04] the God of Peace shall be with you so if
[1:54:06] you in other words flip that around if
[1:54:09] you want the God of Peace to be with you
[1:54:11] the things that you've heard and learned
[1:54:15] and received don't do them so if you're
[1:54:18] not walking on obedience to the word you
[1:54:20] can't expect expect the peace of God to
[1:54:21] be with you
[1:54:23] if you're trying to do your own way with
[1:54:25] your own
[1:54:26] thinking you we we'll pray for you to
[1:54:28] have peace certainly but it's not
[1:54:32] coming it'll be temporary it won't be a
[1:54:35] real lasting
[1:54:39] transformation do it's not in thinking
[1:54:41] it's in
[1:54:43] doing all right musicians if you'd come
[1:54:47] I got a lot more material which I
[1:54:49] expected I would
[1:54:55] I'm going to skip to the last
[1:55:01] portion this is what Paul is telling us
[1:55:03] and this is the way to victory over
[1:55:08] depression don't do not engage your mind
[1:55:11] in worry when anxious and worried
[1:55:14] thoughts come treat that as an
[1:55:16] enemy that's a foreign combatant he's
[1:55:19] not welcome here he's going to be he's
[1:55:21] going to be shock on sight
[1:55:24] amen instead pray worship give thanks to
[1:55:28] God for the answer in
[1:55:31] faith father these worried thoughts are
[1:55:34] coming to me I cast them down in the
[1:55:37] name of Jesus Christ Lord this is the
[1:55:40] situation I'm feeling concerned about
[1:55:42] would you come would you move in that
[1:55:43] situation would you would you heal would
[1:55:46] you give wisdom would you would you
[1:55:48] protect us whatever it might be and then
[1:55:51] we say thank you God for healing for
[1:55:53] delivering for
[1:55:56] protecting then the next thing the enemy
[1:55:58] is not going to give up he's going to
[1:55:59] come back and he's going to try to give
[1:56:01] more thoughts then you just
[1:56:04] say I remember that time I was sick and
[1:56:06] laid down in the
[1:56:08] hospital God delivered me from from
[1:56:10] death oh my how he how how the Holy
[1:56:14] Spirit came and showed me those things
[1:56:16] how we start to think about the the
[1:56:18] blessings oh my look at the wonderful
[1:56:21] children God is bless me with and how
[1:56:23] they're growing and the F the the the
[1:56:25] family of God I have around the things
[1:56:27] that you can be be thankful
[1:56:29] for th those are the things that you
[1:56:31] should start to think about anything
[1:56:33] that's excellent and worthy of Praise
[1:56:36] think about
[1:56:38] that then next Jus you have to make sure
[1:56:42] you're doing you're walking in obedience
[1:56:44] you're putting into practice the things
[1:56:47] that you've learned and heard from the
[1:56:49] messenger of the age in the word h
[1:56:53] then the God of Peace will be with
[1:56:56] you
[1:56:59] amen again I I just I want to
[1:57:04] [Music]
[1:57:06] uh I just want to say to those
[1:57:10] maybe maybe you're listening in maybe
[1:57:13] you're not here maybe you're listening
[1:57:15] in and you've been raised up in this
[1:57:19] Society that's valued your feelings and
[1:57:22] your happiness above the truth above
[1:57:26] real healing and real
[1:57:28] Deliverance I'm not I I'm never trying
[1:57:30] to talk down to anybody that would be
[1:57:32] suffering in their minds and in their
[1:57:34] hearts but I'm trying to give you the
[1:57:37] right way of looking at the world yes
[1:57:41] Through The Eyes of almighty
[1:57:44] God there's always healing there's
[1:57:46] always
[1:57:47] Victory if if if you if if your eyes are
[1:57:51] on focused so focused on
[1:57:54] yourself then why don't you do something
[1:57:56] for someone
[1:57:58] else amen why don't you stop thinking
[1:58:00] about yourself and go serve someone
[1:58:02] who's been broken just like you
[1:58:05] have there's countless stories women who
[1:58:09] are in prostitution their whole life
[1:58:11] sold into prostitution as little girls
[1:58:14] they get they get
[1:58:16] delivered uh someone comes to help them
[1:58:19] a missionary comes overseas baby comes
[1:58:21] to help help them what what happens what
[1:58:24] happens they end up serving the very
[1:58:27] people that they were
[1:58:29] before and what are they they're they're
[1:58:31] full of
[1:58:32] joy they're full of Peace they're full
[1:58:34] of Happiness why because it's not about
[1:58:37] not about us it's not about what we're
[1:58:39] feeling or thinking we're here to live
[1:58:42] for others we don't earn our eternal
[1:58:45] life by living for others but if you
[1:58:47] have eternal life if you're a possessor
[1:58:49] of eternal life you will live for others
[1:58:52] eternal life is living for others amen
[1:58:56] giving
[1:58:58] out the devil will try to take you into
[1:59:01] depression he'll make you run from
[1:59:03] church run from fellowship run from
[1:59:05] talking to other
[1:59:08] people stop listening to brother brandom
[1:59:11] stop listening to sermons stop having
[1:59:14] devotions and on and on and
[1:59:17] on he'll he'll put you into conflicts
[1:59:20] and and you'll just turn into a gosp and
[1:59:23] become a victim instead of handling with
[1:59:25] the way the word word says resolve your
[1:59:27] conflicts with the person directly amen
[1:59:30] just talk about it it's
[1:59:32] fine what's be that's that's much better
[1:59:35] than going down this line and turning
[1:59:37] yourself into a victim of your
[1:59:41] circumstances that's not
[1:59:44] scriptural God wants to heal you and
[1:59:46] deliver you more even more than you want
[1:59:50] to be delivered
[1:59:53] and maybe the problem is well I was
[1:59:56] delivered once but now it's come back
[1:59:58] maybe you haven't put the word to
[2:00:02] practice maybe you haven't let's keep
[2:00:05] the devil's punches off of us now let's
[2:00:07] not just say well the devil's got a
[2:00:09] Punch coming and just stand there with
[2:00:10] our with our hands down I mean if Mike
[2:00:13] Tyson is coming to punch you you better
[2:00:14] put your hands
[2:00:15] [Music]
[2:00:19] up you don't stand and let the devil
[2:00:22] beat on you you keep the punches off and
[2:00:25] you learn to punch
[2:00:28] back because you're not a victim you're
[2:00:30] an overcomer that's right not in your
[2:00:34] own power but in the strength of the
[2:00:35] Holy Ghost in
[2:00:37] you he's not pressing you through a pipe
[2:00:42] right he's giving you the keys to walk
[2:00:46] in
[2:00:47] Victory let's stand
[2:00:52] Heavenly Father we thank you so much for
[2:00:54] your word we thank you so much for your
[2:00:56] light for your life we thank thank you
[2:00:58] for your healing power
[2:01:00] Lord father I just pray for anyone
[2:01:04] who's suffering in their mind and their
[2:01:08] emotions Lord I pray that you would
