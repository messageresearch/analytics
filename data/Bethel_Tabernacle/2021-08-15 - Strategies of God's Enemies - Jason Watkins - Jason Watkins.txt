TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] praise the lord good morning america amen let's just stand our feet and open in prayer and put my presentation up folks father we thank you for this morning thank you for the group gathered out here master now of course we have material laid before us but lord without the anointing of the holy spirit it would just be word only lord but the word lord it came in power and demonstration it wasn't in just a word only that would lord deal with the conscience of man but it must reach down into the soul and of course only you can do that so we commit ourselves to you right now humble our heart before you lord and in your presence may you teach us your word we committed to you in jesus name amen praise the lord amen so um okay so i'm gonna drive it here amen amen we have um i believe i have my all of my uh powerpoints or i mean all of my slides with the scriptures that we will need so we're looking today you can be seated i'm terribly sorry strategies of god's spiritual enemies now i think that that i you know as you've heard me say before i don't take titles lightly um titles to me because i i i'm very much aware that if you don't get the meaning right off the bat sometimes uh then that can really be costly and by the time you catch up especially on a sunday school lesson like this then we're already already ahead of you and it's difficult to gather it all so when we look then at this topic i want to take and i believe i have it in my very first slide first timothy 4 1. i don't know if that screen is like angled up or something it doesn't look right somehow so maybe between services like needs to come over amen it can crash all at once but don't hurt my big boy there took me forever to find him years literally in the in the hunt around the world and i finally found him so amen i usually walk out and you good yeah me too yeah good okay first timothy 4 1 and so we read here now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils now one of the first things that i want you to to realize is that you can see that the word apostasy is there and that's quite intentional uh by the authors in the in the version of the bible that i use the king james bible i have the the editor put that there but i want you to notice something that apostasy is not limited to just the end time a lot of times we say that we go the great apostasy we go oh yeah at the end time but he even here speaks about the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils now granted our scripture is dealing categorically and rather specifically with the latter times how many believe we're in that but you want to understand that we're not saying oh you know wow news flash there's a great apostasy at the end apostasy actually began um even as far back as the early church and so when we think about apostasy we're talking about how that you know this is where uh anything that begins to pull away from the word of god from the very earliest days was apostasy apostasy means the abandonment of a religious or political belief it could mean the renunciation and so you know it's synonymous in fact is with renunciation of belief abandonment of belief and so you can have paul talking about in the early church where he would say you know i tell you today even weeping that many have departed from the faith and actually paul said have become enemies of the cross now it's it's always been a lesson to me a very deep lesson to my spirit that paul says i tell you that even weeping because there's a very natural tendency to have to have righteous indignation to say they've become enemies of the cross then they're my enemies but this wasn't something that that that angered paul this broke paul it broke his heart and you know i was just listening uh yesterday to brother branham in the sixth seal which we're gonna go along those lines in the main service and brother branham says you know he says at one point in in the first part of the sermon he says how that he says something happened in the room there today said it nearly took my breath and he said i had to walk outside and just walk around he doesn't elaborate on it until he gets to the end when he begins to break it down some more and what he was actually seeing was not some astonishing doctrine he had already got that but he the lord was actually showing him the people and friends that he knew and rubbed shoulders with how that they had missed it and were gonna miss it and even dark shadows were already hanging over their lives he doesn't call any names but it it literally he had to get up and walk around because the impact to say surely not that brother surely not that sister surely not that church and yet we find that the words of jesus are not going to be annulled that that broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many will go therein and there will only be a very few find the straight and narrow way amen but it should inform our thinking when we read paul's reaction to apostasy that it it shouldn't always just make us rise up and ready to draw a sword and cut somebody's head off and say okay you're done you're out of here forget you we never want to see you again no it it maybe there's nothing we can do about it that's not what i'm talking about but i'm talking about what's the reaction of our heart yeah see what what should be the attitude remember that it is the jew who says give me vengeance brother branham says the gentile says father they know not what they do forgive them they know not what they do now the lord is going to forgive who he will he told moses that i'll have mercy on whom i will and even in times of of when you when you trace revelation um chapter 7 and you go back and trace it with ezekiel chapter 9 there at this opening scene of the tribulation period under the sixth seal you find that that it's so terrible that even ezekiel falls on his face and pleads with god you're going to wipe everybody out have mercy on us my goodness you're killing all of us and the and and you know a lot of times we think well that was ezekiel surely the lord would say okay ezekiel i like you so much i'm gonna do it he didn't do that to moses and he loved moses above everybody but he said moses i will have mercy on whom i'll have mercy and whom i will heart and i'll harden whom i'm going to destroy i'm going to destroy and you remember even even david here you find david with the father's love running trying to save the life of absalom i get it it's his son he who he loved but here david is trying to save a man whom god had already determined to destroy and there wasn't gonna it wasn't gonna happen and so ezekiel begins to plead with the lord and the lord just says they've had their chance ezekiel i've heard their tears before i've always relented i've always spared them i'm not doing it anymore we've reached the end and that's where the tribulation period that's facing the world that was ezekiel 9 and revelation 7 are speaking about the the two witnesses um going there just it correlates with revelation 11 revelation 14 those 144 000 and so you want to real realize friends that those who who go into apostasy do so by their own choosing and that's that you've got to maintain that or it really casts god in an incorrect light that those people are bringing upon themselves retroactive judgment amen and that's huge i remember talking to a magistrate one time at the sheriff's department or somewhere i was talking we were in a conversation and he was saying how that many young men and young women come had come before him and he would often times if he felt compelled to have mercy maybe they had an exceptional case and he just felt a twinge of you know this this warrants a a second chance and so he said more often than not he said i would go ahead and find them guilty according to the evidence he said that was never in question that they were guilty was pretty easy to show he said but then i would sentence them to the standard sentence and say okay this is i sentence you to five years in jail he said however i will under my authority suspend that sentence and that means that that sentence hangs over your head and it's not going to be enforced by anybody because i'm suspending it nobody can enforce it on you the only way that sentence can fall on your head is if you go back out and do that again but if you keep your nose clean and you you stay in the straight and narrow then after after five months that'll go off for you and it'll go away and then you're completely out from under the threat of it and so you know god has in the tribulation period and so so this judge would say when people would come back you know here they got caught doing it again now they're back in front of me say okay you know there's your sentence and they go oh you know you shouldn't do that to me and he said i would always point out to them young man young lady i'm not doing that to you you did that to you i told you last time it was hanging there it was suspended i had mercy but if you did it again you would reach up there and release the cord it's you doing that and so you remember we we read a scripture uh i think last time i was hearing the pulpit of how that people chose the pleasures of they chose sin as their pleasures that they made that conscious choice to do that and that's where apostasy comes in fact is when you go into the bible knowledge commentary you find this as the repository and guardian of the truth the church must be aware of the strategies of the truth's enemies it is crucial then for the church to understand what god has revealed about these enemies all right uh according to this teaching my screen keeps vanishing here for some reason according to this teaching the situation will degenerate as christ's return approaches spiritual error and this is a very large point in fact is i'm almost basing everything in my sunday school lesson today on this next line spiritual error is seldom due to innocent mistakes it is more often due to the conscious strategies of god's spiritual enemies all right now let's look at these statements from brother branham god's power to transform brother branham says she is naked under the word of civilization higher education better civilization higher ethics imagine that even even sometimes they they pass laws with the intention of we need a higher ethical standard here but it doesn't it doesn't change the system you see and and so he says let me be sure that this soaks in and these quotes now here friends especially to youth and young men and young women just starting with their plan for life look at what he says here let me be sure that this soaks in it's all of the devil and will be destroyed at the coming of the lord he goes on further in the invisible union he says when scientific education everything is absolutely contrary to god the whole system of civilization that we have now is absolutely antichrist educational system is antichrist civilization is antichrist it's against god he says further here in leadership oh you see it's this intellectual day that we're living in education civilization and the modern trend of the day is all of the devil civilization of the devil yes sir the bible said it is this civilization has death so who do you imagine it's of see this civilization has death will we have a civil uh civilization like this in the other world no sir we'll have a different kind of civilization education all these things they're of the devil science perverting the natural things making something else finally in the message i knoweth it not now watch the spirit following it there will come a time in the name of the lord that people will go completely insane the bible says so so the bible teaches us that so so it's not um you know it's we we we when we think about a certain scripture that i'm gonna get to here in a minute uh let me go ahead and get it maybe so we can read it first peter 1 13 wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of jesus christ right let me back up again so wherefore gird up the loins of your mind in other words there is coming a grace at the end time there is coming a special grace you better be thankful to god because you live in an age where it is impossible the earth is too dark too wicked the the gross darkness on the minds of the people men's minds going insane uh civilization education science politics social issues name it whatever you want to name the bible shows us prophetically that it's all orchestrated by and under the control of the antichrist system of the devil all right so so when we think about this time this special grace given for god's family at the end time now it i i want you to to to really get a hold of this fact that god is showing you there's actually a special grace i mean do you realize that this last age unwise virgin from the old testament through 2000 years of new testament none of them have to go through the great tribulation period not one of them amen only the last age say gee that's unfair it's not unfair brother branham showed us because this is the age that has the has the greatest the greatest unfolding we have a time you know here before the bride you know that that that we have such a combined understanding of the word made and i mean even a combined understanding i'm not talking about an understanding that we have greater than saint paul but i'm talking about we have a combined perspective we have the history of 2 000 years to look at just our combined perspective uh we have a a manifestation of the bride becoming the word do you realize that that's where the omega church excels beyond the alpha church not in the un not in the revelation of god but the bride actually becoming the word that early church fell away before they could get very far they only went maybe 20 years and it was already corrupting now we've had here friends more than half a century and instead of instead of growing up getting cold and growing away we're getting more we're getting warmer we're getting on more understanding we and and just by virtue of contrast just by the fact that you live in the in the most unique hour unparalleled in history unprecedented in history the convergence of noah and and lots day the lid torn off of hell the atmosphere is filled with demons demon power streaming through the earth amen amen satan is now the god of the evil age it's now satan's eden there has never been a people and just by the fact that you've been called to so much and the age is the worst it's ever been how are you going to do it god said don't worry there's a grace coming when the revelation of jesus christ comes realize you won't be able to meet the the great but don't worry i've got a grace that i'm going to apply to your lives see now that being the case then you begin to look at at how this grace is is given to us and then i can promise you that however you imagine and if you hit it right on the head and say okay it's coming by you know by going to church it's coming by hearing the preaching it's coming by playing tapes it's come by reading my bible it's coming by fellowship it's coming back by prayer it's all of the above yeah amen all of the above check box every one of those make sure you got a check box in every one of those because don't think the devil don't know how it's coming to you that's right see and so remember that that the enemy and knowing how it's coming to you is going to meet you right at that place in your mind to try to take you away from all of those check boxes because if you if you get drawn away from those check boxes then you're then that grace is going to be largely ineffective on your life and you might wonder why i don't not have more overcoming power i thought i had a grace coming at the revelation of jesus christ i don't know i've received it i believe it yeah but but how is it affected in your life it's affected by coming to church it's reflected by hearing the gospel it's affected by playing the tapes it's affected by reading your bible it's affected by prayer time fellowship time amen amen and so so when we look at these scriptures now first peter we read it all right look at it again wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end gird up the loins of your mind because this is how the grace coming has an effect in your life how many want its effect right there it is there is a grace that is to be brought unto you see that is to be it's something held for the end time amen because you're going to need it amen there is a grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ so all right what do i do do i just sit down and it's going to fall on me no you've got to gird up your mind see watch here is the from the nlt prepare your minds for action and exercise self-control amen see so this isn't just oh where there's there's just a some magical mythical legendary grace some i don't know kind of thing that's going to move and i'm going to breathe it in maybe rub it on me like lotion or you know i don't know what what's it going to come no it's coming by the word into your mind amen and so there's where the devil's going to attack so the bible says listen it's coming make sure you people hey you people at the end it's coming make sure you exercise your mind amen have yourself ready for self-control see so prepare your minds for action action hearing recognizing acting on the word of god you can think healthy thoughts but if you don't practice healthy lifestyles you won't be healthy yeah and wishing won't make it so i wish it would but it won't and so he says put all your hope in the gracious salvation that will come to you when jesus christ is revealed to the world see watch put all your hope there this is why i read those quotes where brother brad i'm talking about the insanity of the world and all civilization and government education everything's of the devil don't put your hope there we live there we function in that we have to have the functions of living i'm not saying let's go build a commune and let's live apart from the world no that's not even the commission jesus sent you in and sheep among wolves that's the commission of the church going to all the world in any condition i will be with you always see but you but there is an action here put all your hope in the gracious salvation that will come to you when jesus christ is revealed to the world look at here it is in the uh eugene peterson's message translation roll up your sleeves like that put your put your mind excuse me in gear be totally ready to receive the gift that's coming when jesus arrives amen i mean what good does it do me to bring you something you're not ready to receive it you have no preparation you know i i'm gonna bring you some great thing you don't even have a way to avail yourselves of it see so so the the apostle is saying hey you people of the end time it's going to be crazy out there you're going to need this grace good news don't panic breathe everybody calm down it's coming he's going to send it it's a special grace but you're going to have to be prepared to use it you're going to have to be prepared you can't use it very effectively if your whole life is caught up in everything that the antichrist controls right so you see its balance friends of course we work jobs and get education have careers of course we do nothing wrong with that whatsoever but but it's all about balance it's about you understanding who you are versus who the rest of everybody else is what your future is versus the other future i'm not saying we judge i i'm saying i do this i judge to make sure i'm in yeah amen i want to judge let a man examine himself and you know and and that he be not judged that's where i want to be today i'm not here i don't have no time to spend you know uh telling the world oh you're out too bad but i'm here to say i'm in and i can get you in if you'll just listen amen and so so we realize here that he says roll up your sleeves not many people want to do that today people don't want to work people don't want to labor they don't want to take the responsibility that it takes to have a spiritual home a spiritual life a spiritual family it's work on purpose it's that way see he says and i uh and i love how eugene peterson puts that in there a future in god if you're going to have a future in god here's the instruction manual amen roll up your sleeves how many want a future in god roll up your sleeves roll up your sleeves you want a future in god roll up your sleeves get ready to be totally ready to receive the gift that's coming finally this week's translation i love this one the best wherefore having put out of the way once for all everything that would impede the free action of your mind be calm and collected in spirit and set your hope perfectly holy and unchangeably without doubt and dependency upon the grace that is being brought to you upon the occasion of the revelation of jesus christ i absolutely love that wherefore having put out of the way this is past tense say brother jason i love the last part of that i love when it talks about the grace on this great occasion this revelation that's coming but he's and we all love that but the the precursor the the the prerequisite is having past tense put out of the way once and for all everything that would impede the free action of your mind so don't let the devil find his way into your life impeding what god wants to do with this grace in your life finally i want to read brother branham from the seventh seal he says i thank him for jesus christ for without sending him for the propitiation of our sins we'd all be a big muck of sin with no hope now how many can get off their high horse and say amen amen amen it requires you to look at that humbly we're going to read it again but you're going to have to be humble to accept it i thank him for jesus christ for without sending him for the propitiation of our sins we'd all everybody say all we'd all be in the big muck of sin with no hope but by whose grace his remember the grace to be given to you at the revelation of jesus christ see but by his grace his blood cleanses all sin just like the drop of ink in a bucket of clorox you'd never find the ink again when our sins are confessed it's put in the blood of jesus christ they'll never be known again amen god forgets them i didn't without a prophet i didn't know that was possible how does an omniscient god forget something see you know you know you know people say you know you hear the old saying people believe what they want to believe right well god forgets what he wants to forget amen so you just take comfort in that say why did he forget it because he wanted to because he because i don't like thinking of of of any negative thing in my children or my grandchildren i like just looking at them as perfect amen and and if they do something i'm i'm the first one to try to smooth it over and say oh well it's all right let's just press on and you're still perfect amen look at what he says god forgets them they never was even done now only god can do that because you can't even if you you can't even reverse time like that they they never was even done and as long as that sacrifice is laying there in an atonement for us then that's all that's it see we're not sinners no more we're christians by what the grace of god remember in our own selves we'd probably be just as bad as we ever was but see the grace of god has applied to us and that's what has made us what we are today christian brothers and sisters amen god bless you today we'll have our intermission and the regular service will start shortly god bless you
