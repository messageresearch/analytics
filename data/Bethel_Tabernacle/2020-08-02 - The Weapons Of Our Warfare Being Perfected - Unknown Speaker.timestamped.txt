[2:20] so
[2:36] good morning god bless you
[2:40] let's look right into the scripture this
[2:43] morning
[2:44] our familiar reading in revelation
[2:46] chapter one
[2:48] amen
[3:00] we're trying to get a um connection over
[3:02] in the house
[3:03] guys and it's not working that computer
[3:05] won't connect
[3:06] so davey's going to need that this
[3:08] morning so if that could get resolved
[3:10] i apologize for coming in late i was
[3:12] over there trying to do it myself
[3:16] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[3:19] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[3:24] things which must shortly come to pass
[3:27] and he sent
[3:28] and signified it by his angel unto his
[3:31] servant john
[3:32] who bear record of the word of god and
[3:35] of the testimony of jesus christ and of
[3:37] all things that he saw
[3:39] praise the lord may the lord bless the
[3:42] reading
[3:43] of his word this morning now we've been
[3:46] looking
[3:47] at these verses and we want to try to
[3:50] make our way
[3:52] through this first verse it's vitally
[3:54] important
[3:56] as we've been stressing that we get the
[3:59] understanding of the revelation of jesus
[4:01] christ and what he's meaning now
[4:04] there's two parts to that and let me
[4:05] just say um
[4:07] as i'm leading in i've been backing up a
[4:10] little bit and rehearsing but
[4:13] you have the archive and uh so
[4:16] i only have a 25 minute class so i don't
[4:18] want to
[4:20] keep backing up and recovering stuff we
[4:22] have the archives and i want to keep
[4:24] moving on
[4:25] i want the first thing i want to notice
[4:26] this morning in our reading
[4:29] is that in that very first verse there's
[4:31] two
[4:32] uh what would i call maybe uh two angles
[4:35] of looking at that
[4:36] to maybe a compound meaning and that
[4:39] is that what is
[4:42] the understanding of jesus christ
[4:46] and who he was and what was his
[4:48] relationship
[4:49] to the father how do we explain his
[4:52] humanity
[4:53] and his deity being uh together
[4:57] in one vessel and that's exactly what he
[4:59] was
[5:00] he was a hundred percent of both he was
[5:03] uh the god man and uh you can't really
[5:06] attribute him
[5:08] and you can't use any other model in
[5:10] scripture
[5:11] perfectly because he's the first of this
[5:14] brand new type of person
[5:15] he's the first he's the beginning of
[5:17] this creation
[5:18] he's the only begotten of the father and
[5:21] that's going to give him unique
[5:23] qualities
[5:24] and we're we've talked about that
[5:26] extensively
[5:27] teaching on the godhead but i want to
[5:30] uh catch the second angle to look at
[5:33] when you read
[5:34] the verse the revelation of jesus christ
[5:38] that you want to realize that since the
[5:41] term
[5:41] revelation is apocalypse and apocalypsis
[5:45] and
[5:45] and that greek word means an uncovering
[5:48] or an unveiling or let me give you this
[5:52] word unfolding just like
[5:55] it's it's held in scrolls and when the
[5:58] seals are broken the scrolls are
[6:00] un unwound and in this case
[6:04] that we're finding that jesus himself
[6:08] is becoming identified the the
[6:11] revelation of jesus christ is not
[6:14] merely who he was as the god-man though
[6:17] that's
[6:17] a very fundamental part of it but it is
[6:20] describing to you
[6:22] what what god is doing in
[6:25] jesus christ in the ages to come
[6:29] we made the statement to you last time
[6:32] that the revelation of jesus christ
[6:36] that we read in the book of revelation
[6:39] this is the this is the unfolding
[6:42] or the uh continuation
[6:46] of his future work which is not
[6:50] the work of the nail scarred man that
[6:53] body as we've said lays as an atonement
[6:56] for us on the altar of god
[6:58] so it's not the body of the nail scarred
[7:01] man
[7:02] that in that office he completed his
[7:06] earthly assignment
[7:07] on the cross he said it is finished and
[7:10] indeed the purchase price for his family
[7:14] in redemption was finished he never has
[7:17] to come back and go to calvary again
[7:19] he died once for sin the bible says and
[7:22] neither do i have to go to calvary
[7:24] because
[7:25] by the holy ghost i'm identified in
[7:27] christ as going to calvary with him
[7:29] and i was literally within him and so
[7:33] we it we're not talking about that it's
[7:35] not a continuation
[7:37] of the work of the lamb we're not saying
[7:40] it's not a continuation of the logos in
[7:42] fact it is both of those
[7:44] it is the continuation of the lamb of
[7:46] god
[7:47] the intercessor the the the redeemer
[7:50] our savior the logos that god
[7:54] that was the form god was in when he
[7:56] created the world
[7:58] so it's still the work of the lamb all
[8:00] the way to the millennium
[8:02] he is forever our intercessor and thanks
[8:04] be to god
[8:06] and so we realize that what is he doing
[8:08] in the book of revelation
[8:10] the revelation of jesus christ is
[8:13] describing his
[8:14] continuing work but now in a new body
[8:18] which is the church all right so we
[8:20] realized that
[8:21] he finished the work of redemption at
[8:24] calvary
[8:25] paying the price now the the full work
[8:28] of redemption
[8:29] still has to have a claiming part that's
[8:32] going to happen at the end time
[8:33] and we're not rushing ahead to that
[8:35] we'll get to it as we go along in our
[8:37] study
[8:38] but what you see here in this term the
[8:41] revelation of jesus christ
[8:43] is that is that now he is going
[8:46] to do uh he accomplished the father's
[8:49] will in his nail-scarred body
[8:51] but now he's going to bring forth
[8:54] the second eve because because he's
[8:57] doing it in eve
[8:58] uh so so you've got to keep that in mind
[9:02] it's not jesus with the nail scarred
[9:04] hands
[9:05] that body was the word made flesh amen
[9:09] and so this is christ the logos
[9:12] the continuing of the word and it's now
[9:15] christ
[9:15] in his church a new body all right
[9:18] that's important a new body working
[9:22] all the way through the book of
[9:24] revelation that's what the book of
[9:26] revelation
[9:27] is about is the continuing work of
[9:29] christ
[9:30] in a body so christ in you
[9:34] in that new form the logos so he
[9:37] finishes his work
[9:38] as a in redemption to purchase and the
[9:41] scripture
[9:42] calls him the last adam in that regard
[9:45] so he's going to do the work now in the
[9:48] book of revelation to recreate
[9:51] the last eve the whole program of god
[9:54] is to take adam and eve back
[9:57] to eternity again those are important
[10:00] points
[10:01] so he unveils himself through the church
[10:04] ages he displays his
[10:06] attributes that's what the world is
[10:09] seeing
[10:10] he has revealed himself and that's what
[10:13] the revelation is all about he's
[10:14] revealed himself in his
[10:16] attributes now we realize
[10:19] that that when it comes down uh to
[10:23] what the scripture describes in
[10:26] about the body of christ or the second
[10:29] eve
[10:29] is we find that uh several things we
[10:32] find that
[10:33] we are a mini membered body and so
[10:37] when when jesus is coming to bring this
[10:40] revelation to john
[10:42] he's saying look john you know me you
[10:45] saw me
[10:46] you lived with me you walked with me and
[10:48] now what what you're about to see
[10:51] is the same me but i'm gonna be
[10:54] it's gonna be me in you on the earth
[10:58] and that's why the apostle would say
[11:00] that you
[11:01] are written epistles seen
[11:04] and read of all men and and basically
[11:08] paul is is saying in the in the thus
[11:11] saith the lord coming from christ your
[11:15] written epistles peter deals with this
[11:17] that you are lively stones
[11:19] and that that your that god is saying to
[11:22] you your written epistles in other words
[11:24] you're me in the earth i was in that
[11:27] body now i'm in your body
[11:29] that was me now you're me all right and
[11:32] that
[11:33] is the idea that we get in the mini
[11:36] membered body
[11:37] and so we realize that that the
[11:40] revelation of jesus
[11:42] christ is the fullness of the godhead
[11:45] bodily on earth again this is in fact
[11:49] the whole plan of god is to work this
[11:52] program
[11:53] that the the word which is living out
[11:57] now it's further part which is jesus
[12:01] because the bible shows us that jesus is
[12:04] the name of the word
[12:07] jesus is the name of the word we read
[12:09] that in ephesians
[12:10] 3 9. so when we come to this we're
[12:14] beginning to talk about the principle
[12:16] now of the book of revelation
[12:19] and and this is a bright age we call it
[12:21] a bright age we call it the bride's book
[12:24] because this this was a beginning
[12:27] in the alpha age and the the bible
[12:30] talked about how it would fall away
[12:32] and then how it would be restored but in
[12:35] each age
[12:36] even during the falling away time even
[12:38] during the restoration
[12:40] time that that god was bringing
[12:43] his body into a form of him to identify
[12:47] himself
[12:47] in the word because when you read in the
[12:49] book of revelation
[12:51] one of the first things that john
[12:53] observes is that he's walking
[12:55] in the midst of seven lamp stands
[12:58] and so where the purpose then is to
[13:01] bring the bride at the end time
[13:04] the elect you know not just at the end
[13:07] time
[13:07] but all down through the ages was to
[13:10] give the bride
[13:12] in every age rest now this is the same
[13:15] rest the type of this
[13:16] we find is in the old testament where
[13:19] when he
[13:20] brought them out of egypt the promise
[13:22] was
[13:23] i'll take you to a land of rest it's a
[13:25] land flowing with milk and honey it's
[13:27] actually your inheritance that god
[13:30] designed
[13:31] for you before the foundation of the
[13:33] world now there's trespassers there
[13:36] because sin came in you're going to go
[13:38] and you're going to dispossess them
[13:40] because i've given you that land to rest
[13:43] in now
[13:44] we're born just like that was a land
[13:46] this is a land i'm made out of the earth
[13:48] and i was i was intended that this body
[13:51] would live in the presence of god
[13:53] however because of
[13:55] sin there's trespassers living in this
[13:58] body
[13:58] there's the works of sin that are in my
[14:01] flesh and therefore the baptism of the
[14:03] holy ghost
[14:05] which only comes by a revelation of the
[14:07] word
[14:08] in every age that's how the holy ghost
[14:10] came
[14:11] we talk about the token and we talk
[14:13] about a dip of the holy ghost in the
[14:15] ages
[14:16] i get all of that but but bear in mind
[14:19] christ is walking in the seven lamp
[14:21] stands
[14:22] and every age he is revealing a portion
[14:25] of himself
[14:26] and faith in that portion revealed
[14:29] entitled
[14:30] every believer to the holy ghost and
[14:32] gave them
[14:33] rest the same way that israel was to go
[14:36] into rest and they would have
[14:39] rested had they believed the word amen
[14:42] it's evident that that's what they
[14:44] didn't believe at cadence barnea
[14:46] they did not believe the word and
[14:49] therefore they didn't go into the rest
[14:51] and all down through the ages including
[14:53] this one
[14:54] when people don't believe the word that
[14:57] god sends for the age
[14:59] there's no way to enter into rest we
[15:02] have the word of this
[15:04] hour and we want to thank god and
[15:06] rejoice
[15:07] because in this same way this message
[15:10] which came to us by grace it's all
[15:14] by grace and it it's to bring us over
[15:17] the jordan
[15:18] jordan signifies death we're to go
[15:20] through the death
[15:21] and the resurrection in the land of the
[15:23] holy ghost
[15:24] placing us in a position to be
[15:28] ready for a body change and that is what
[15:30] our generation
[15:32] is all about it's about coming to a body
[15:35] change
[15:36] uh brother branham let me have my
[15:38] powerpoint uh brother georgian
[15:40] we'll go to slide 23 as you can see
[15:42] today is
[15:43] chapter one lesson five i only want to
[15:45] read this one quote on our next slide
[15:48] this comes from the end time evangelism
[15:50] net catch it
[15:52] end time evangelism the end time message
[15:56] is to get the bride ready and prepared
[15:59] for the rapture what can it do according
[16:03] to malachi 4
[16:04] is bring them back to the faith that was
[16:07] once delivered to the saints
[16:09] bring them back to the faith of the
[16:11] fathers the pentecostal part
[16:14] in the restoration time i will restore
[16:17] saith the lord that's real event end
[16:20] time
[16:21] evangelism so so we find that in this
[16:25] that in the last age the bride is
[16:28] not really trying to do necessarily what
[16:32] all the other ages did
[16:33] her evangelism is different she has an
[16:37] end time evangelism and she's not really
[16:40] trying to do
[16:42] what all the other ages did because they
[16:44] were ongoing
[16:45] they were the third age was going to be
[16:48] followed by the fourth followed by the
[16:49] fifth
[16:50] followed by the six but we realize that
[16:52] that in our day we
[16:54] are in the climax of the ages this is
[16:57] the age
[16:58] when there will be a people in this
[17:00] generation
[17:01] that will never taste death and so end
[17:04] time
[17:05] evangelism say well shouldn't we still
[17:07] be holding outreach of course brother
[17:09] branham did
[17:09] shouldn't we go into all the world
[17:11] absolutely we go into all the world
[17:14] the whole the whole rapture is held up
[17:18] until we find that last seed
[17:21] so clearly we still need the power of
[17:24] god
[17:24] revival outreach mission work it must go
[17:28] into all the world because jesus
[17:29] predicated
[17:30] the end upon the fact that that gospel
[17:34] he was preaching
[17:35] which christ was the word christ was the
[17:37] fullness of the word
[17:39] so jesus is saying when the fullness
[17:42] of the word is now in all the earth then
[17:45] the
[17:46] end can come so yes we do
[17:49] evangelize we do missionary work we do
[17:52] preach and teach
[17:53] we do believe in the power of god but
[17:55] what we understand
[17:57] now is that we're not building for
[17:59] another age to come
[18:01] this is the climax age this is the age
[18:04] that leaves and so
[18:05] we're not looking and this is why this
[18:07] is so important
[18:08] because we're not looking for another
[18:12] revival
[18:13] the revival promised to the bride was
[18:16] the fulfillment of malachi 4.
[18:18] and the fulfillment not just god sent a
[18:20] prophet
[18:21] but the message that that prophet
[18:23] brought and the
[18:24] opening of the seals and the bride
[18:27] eating on that book
[18:28] and becoming the final voice to the
[18:30] final age because
[18:31] the second verse references everything
[18:35] that would be seen
[18:37] and so we find that the earth is to have
[18:40] a visual they are to see what god
[18:44] is doing in our age so second
[18:47] corinthians 15
[18:48] 52 in a moment in the twinkling of an
[18:51] eye
[18:52] at the last trump for the dead for the
[18:55] trumpet shall sound
[18:56] and the dead shall be raised
[18:58] incorruptable and we
[18:59] shall be changed so this is the
[19:02] age of the resurrection this is the
[19:05] resurrection age
[19:06] this is the catching away age we're not
[19:08] putting it off into the future
[19:10] we're not waiting for another revival
[19:13] the
[19:14] bride's revival is here now
[19:17] and our task is to daily
[19:20] enter into rest and how do you enter
[19:22] into rest by believing the word
[19:24] and what does that do it dispossesses
[19:27] the enemy
[19:28] and so what is the bride's revival
[19:31] dispossessing this the enemy from out of
[19:34] this flesh
[19:35] and coming into the living image of the
[19:37] living god to be the final voice to the
[19:40] final age
[19:41] and that's the message jesus was saying
[19:43] when the world sees that
[19:46] amen when the world sees the fullness of
[19:49] the word
[19:50] come back again that's the sign of the
[19:53] end time when the world has that
[19:55] the end will come so so we realize that
[19:59] the world
[20:00] is to be in the condition of sodom and
[20:03] gomorrah
[20:04] that's according to luke as it was in
[20:06] the days of lot
[20:07] even so so shall it be when the son of
[20:10] man
[20:10] is revealed so we see that the world
[20:14] is fulfilling its part perfectly
[20:17] amen now if you can see that on the
[20:20] streets
[20:21] you can now i can i can tell you no one
[20:24] got in line to fulfill that it wasn't
[20:27] like hey
[20:27] hey world let's go fulfill luke 17 30.
[20:31] they weren't attempting to fulfill it
[20:33] trying to fulfill it
[20:34] but there were events happening in the
[20:37] supernatural realm
[20:39] that was bringing this world
[20:41] irreversibly to that fulfillment and it
[20:44] didn't matter who they elected
[20:45] or what church or what preacher rose up
[20:48] the world was coming to just what jesus
[20:50] said it would do
[20:51] and if that's the case then the bride
[20:54] also
[20:55] is it doesn't matter how you feel she is
[20:57] coming
[20:58] to that perfection so the bride
[21:02] is getting into the place where she will
[21:05] leave this world
[21:06] and go in to another dimension now
[21:10] we realize that when we talk about the
[21:12] rapture and the bride
[21:13] going into another dimension we're not
[21:15] talking about
[21:16] flying off into the milky way we're
[21:19] talking about
[21:19] just simply stepping into another
[21:22] dimension
[21:22] and it's not going to be a big step i'm
[21:25] thankful to god today
[21:26] to believe that because of the bride's
[21:29] revival
[21:30] being among us that we are now a short
[21:32] step away
[21:34] from the body change amen i'm not
[21:36] looking for
[21:37] anything else to perfect me i already
[21:40] have the other unfolding message
[21:42] it's still unfolding christ is still
[21:44] being made known
[21:45] i'm still dispossessing enemies so
[21:49] that is the bride's revival dispossess
[21:52] the enemies that's what the word came
[21:54] for uh when
[21:55] when when all the world sees the
[21:58] fullness of the word
[22:00] in flesh again the end will come
[22:03] god bless you god bless you let's pray
[22:05] father we thank you
[22:06] for our lesson today we commit it to you
[22:08] now to the hearts and minds of the
[22:10] people
[22:11] in jesus name amen god bless you
[22:30] [Music]
[22:45] testing there we go good morning saints
[22:49] can we just stand and have a word of
[22:51] prayer
[22:52] are you happy to be in the house of the
[22:53] lord
[22:56] god is good all the time
[23:00] amen let's just bow our heads
[23:04] almighty god father it's always a
[23:07] privilege
[23:08] lord to be able to come before your
[23:11] throne lord
[23:13] knowing that we have a god that cares so
[23:15] much for us lord
[23:18] knowing that lord for heart is right and
[23:21] we just

[57:41] sure have been enjoying uh the ministry
[57:44] we had a good time
[57:45] ministering the sunday school class i
[57:47] just apologized for that we can't let uh
[57:50] what's one of the
[57:52] classes that we had to say no live
[57:54] audience i'm just sorry for that i know
[57:56] there's a lot of people who enjoy coming
[57:57] to that in the live audience but
[57:59] you have the archive you're able to
[58:01] stream it live
[58:02] um either if you're on the um
[58:05] other half of the alphabet and you're
[58:07] not here today you were able to stream
[58:09] it i'm sure
[58:09] and if you were on your way to church
[58:11] you could probably catch it a lot of
[58:13] times when i can't catch the
[58:14] video driving because the signal's all
[58:17] over the place
[58:18] sometimes the audio will work so that's
[58:20] just a little a little
[58:22] note there sometimes you can catch the
[58:23] audio

[59:00] we walk in the flesh now we'd rather not
[59:02] be in this flesh
[59:04] but we are okay so here's the advice
[59:09] we do not war after the flesh so my
[59:12] all of my energies
[59:16] ought not to be worrying over this flesh
[59:20] and fussing over it and trying to trying

[59:32] of the world's warfare
[59:36] no i read that wrong for the weapons of
[59:39] the antichrist
[59:41] are not for the weapons of who
[59:46] our warfare are not carnal
[59:49] but mighty see they're not carnal but
[59:51] they are mighty
[59:53] through god to the pulling down
[59:56] of strongholds casting down
[1:00:00] imaginations and every high thing
[1:00:04] that exalteth itself against the
[1:00:07] knowledge of god
[1:00:09] and bringing into captivity did you know
[1:00:12] you were to go capture something
[1:00:14] bringing into captivity every thought
[1:00:17] to the obedience of christ do you know
[1:00:20] why you have to capture it
[1:00:22] because it won't come into the obedience
[1:00:23] of christ naturally
[1:00:26] because it lives in a fallen body with a
[1:00:29] fallen mind
[1:00:30] you understand the womb of our soul the
[1:00:33] nature of our spirit has been
[1:00:35] changed that's god that's zoe
[1:00:38] but my memory conscience
[1:00:41] reason affections imaginations
[1:00:45] all fallen see that's why
[1:00:49] my sight can he can so tempt me through
[1:00:51] my sight

[1:04:35] everybody in here would admit it
[1:04:37] lord we need your help the world is just
[1:04:40] in a
[1:04:41] chaotic state and my we don't even
[1:04:44] hardly know how to make sense of it all

[1:05:37] amen
[1:05:40] praise the lord
[1:05:44] so the weapons of our warfare we can
[1:05:48] talk about weapons of our warfare and we
[1:05:51] would
[1:05:52] we would bring up you know faith this
[1:05:55] might say
[1:05:56] and say what's a great weapon faith
[1:05:59] you know trust that's a weapon
[1:06:03] prayer that's a weapon
[1:06:07] people don't leverage it often but it is
[1:06:10] a great weapon
[1:06:12] in fact his brother branham called it
[1:06:15] the greatest weapon he makes
[1:06:18] reference to love
[1:06:22] being the greatest power so i think i'd
[1:06:25] like to have the greatest power
[1:06:28] the world you know hollywood has gone
[1:06:32] crazy with all of this superhero stuff
[1:06:36] and every kid's got his favorite
[1:06:37] superhero he wants to be
[1:06:40] there are superheroes in the world
[1:06:43] and it's god's family there are people
[1:06:47] who are eternal beings living here
[1:06:50] living among us we're it
[1:06:55] i love this quote was posted by one of
[1:06:58] the ministers in minister's chat early
[1:07:00] this morning
[1:07:01] it's a quote from spurgeon says i just
[1:07:03] love this never heard it before as many
[1:07:05] as much as i've read of charles spurgeon
[1:07:07] spurgeon says when asked what is more
[1:07:11] important
[1:07:12] praying or reading my bible now reading
[1:07:15] your bible is a weapon
[1:07:18] they asked brother branham how do we get
[1:07:19] closer to god now would you imagine
[1:07:21] that's an important question how do i
[1:07:23] get closer to god
[1:07:27] is that important come on is that
[1:07:29] important
[1:07:30] do you want to be closer do you feel
[1:07:33] like you need to be
[1:07:35] so i'm i'm i'm i'm feel pretty close to
[1:07:38] him good i'm glad
[1:07:39] but it's nuts out there
[1:07:43] come on hey how about we just stay in
[1:07:46] simple common sense preaching today
[1:07:50] not going to take you into ethereal
[1:07:51] heights today let's just let's just keep
[1:07:53] it simple
[1:07:54] and let's just all agree wow the world
[1:07:57] in its condition
[1:07:58] i really need to be close to god
[1:08:03] reading my bible and praying
[1:08:06] is what brother branham said so the
[1:08:08] question is a fair
[1:08:10] one when a prophet of this age is
[1:08:12] answering the question
[1:08:13] how do i get closer to god read your
[1:08:15] bible and pray
[1:08:17] spurgeon says when asked
[1:08:20] what is more important praying or
[1:08:23] reading the bible
[1:08:24] i ask what is more important breathing
[1:08:27] in
[1:08:28] or breathing out you tell me
[1:08:33] you tell me tell me which one you could
[1:08:35] do less of
[1:08:38] breathing in or breathing out read your
[1:08:42] bible and pray which one's more
[1:08:43] important which one's more important
[1:08:44] breathing into breathing out
[1:08:47] i thought that was a remarkable
[1:08:50] statement
[1:08:52] love is the greatest power prayer is the
[1:08:55] greatest weapon
[1:08:56] reading our bible is a necessary element
[1:08:59] faith
[1:09:00] capturing thoughts contrary to the word
[1:09:02] there's a big one
[1:09:05] don't entangle yourself with the affairs
[1:09:08] of the world
[1:09:08] that's a big one think about all the
[1:09:11] things that paul could have advised
[1:09:13] timothy on and he picked that one he
[1:09:16] said listen timothy
[1:09:17] you're in a war i'm getting ready to
[1:09:19] depart the time of my departure is at
[1:09:21] hand
[1:09:21] you're going to you're going to be here
[1:09:23] after i'm gone now i'd like to be with
[1:09:25] you timothy for your whole life but
[1:09:27] that's not going to happen god doesn't
[1:09:28] have it
[1:09:29] planned that way so when i'm gone
[1:09:32] grievous wolves are going to come in
[1:09:34] among you and i'm going to tell you how
[1:09:35] to handle this
[1:09:36] whatever you do recognize you're in a
[1:09:38] war and
[1:09:39] when you're in a war recognize that you
[1:09:42] don't want to be entangled with the
[1:09:43] affairs of life
[1:09:45] now hey we got we got to have jobs we
[1:09:47] get educations we run
[1:09:49] businesses we raise families we do live
[1:09:52] here
[1:09:53] so the bible you know when paul talks
[1:09:55] about them
[1:09:56] you know you know going you know leaving
[1:09:58] the world coming out of the world
[1:09:59] and they write paul back you know how do
[1:10:02] we do what does that look like what do
[1:10:04] you mean i mean
[1:10:04] do we do we build a convent and we just
[1:10:07] cloister ourselves
[1:10:08] and paul writes back in his second
[1:10:09] letter and he references that now when i
[1:10:11] said to you about leaving the world of
[1:10:13] course
[1:10:13] i didn't mean you go out of the world
[1:10:15] you live here but you don't live here as
[1:10:17] abusing it
[1:10:18] you don't you live here knowing you're
[1:10:20] not from here
[1:10:22] amen this is a common sense way
[1:10:26] that you're going to keep victory in
[1:10:28] your life
[1:10:29] and i don't know about you but i want
[1:10:31] all the victory i can get
[1:10:33] yes say how much
[1:10:36] is enough more than i got
[1:10:40] when will you be satisfied when i don't
[1:10:43] need to fight anymore
[1:10:44] when i can lay my burdens down
[1:10:48] when i can lay my burdens down and like
[1:10:50] thomas
[1:10:51] like like like like stonewall jackson
[1:10:53] said
[1:10:54] when he he was he was passing away and
[1:10:57] the last words that came out of his
[1:10:59] mouth and
[1:10:59] they they the the the guy who wrote his
[1:11:02] life story who was there
[1:11:04] said you know as if he was inviting all
[1:11:06] of us to go with him
[1:11:08] he said come friends let us cross the
[1:11:11] river
[1:11:12] and set under the shade of a tree oh he
[1:11:15] knew where he was going he knew his
[1:11:16] redeemer lived i'm going to tell you
[1:11:18] something friends when i don't have to
[1:11:19] fight anymore
[1:11:20] i i want victories until while i'm
[1:11:23] fighting i want to
[1:11:24] win i don't like not
[1:11:27] winning
[1:11:31] without love there's no need to prophesy
[1:11:36] there's no need to give your body to be
[1:11:39] burned
[1:11:41] there's no need to be a martyr if you
[1:11:44] don't have love
[1:11:46] there's no need to preach great
[1:11:48] mysteries of god
[1:11:50] if love is not the primary life force
[1:11:54] in your life now we're not talking about
[1:11:56] human filio love that's
[1:11:58] that's just really intense friendship
[1:12:00] that that
[1:12:01] a lot of times is the levels of that are
[1:12:04] predicated by
[1:12:05] you know what have you done for me
[1:12:06] lately that's the
[1:12:08] attitude of the world that's why
[1:12:10] husbands and wives better get married on
[1:12:12] more than just
[1:12:13] filial love because when bad times roll
[1:12:16] in the love wanes
[1:12:18] and naturally so you're not going to
[1:12:20] like somebody that's not
[1:12:22] being nice to you you understand
[1:12:25] so there's got to be an agape love
[1:12:27] there's got to be and there's only one
[1:12:28] form of that and that's god remember
[1:12:30] as i've told you bible doesn't declare
[1:12:32] god has love the bible declares he is
[1:12:34] that actually
[1:12:35] he is love so
[1:12:38] if there's no real love of god which
[1:12:41] only comes by
[1:12:42] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:46] that's what the bible teaches the love
[1:12:48] of god is poured into you by the holy
[1:12:51] ghost
[1:12:52] amen so this kind of love only comes by
[1:12:56] being born again
[1:12:57] that's why you can't fake it the devil
[1:12:59] see right through it
[1:13:01] see but he but he does recognize that
[1:13:04] light when he sees it glowing in you
[1:13:06] amen he's very much afraid of that light
[1:13:10] so you know brother branham talks about
[1:13:12] things like prayer and he says you know
[1:13:14] prayer keeps you from being sticky i
[1:13:17] love that old southern term
[1:13:19] like you know you're like a a a burr
[1:13:22] you ever get around well let me let me
[1:13:24] not go there
[1:13:27] i don't want to i don't want to be a
[1:13:29] bird under your saddle amen i don't want
[1:13:32] to be sticky
[1:13:34] i don't want to be sticky to my friends
[1:13:35] to the family of god i don't want to be
[1:13:37] sticky to the neighbors
[1:13:40] i don't want to be sticky to i don't
[1:13:42] want to be sticky
[1:13:44] here's a here's a statement going to
[1:13:45] blow your mind i wouldn't want to
[1:13:47] come across sticky to antifa amen
[1:13:52] i'd want to stand in the face of all of
[1:13:54] their rage and
[1:13:55] tell them about the love of god and
[1:13:58] say they'd spit in your face they spit
[1:14:00] in his face
[1:14:01] see antifa is not new
[1:14:05] antifa started in heaven where demons
[1:14:08] got got got together and that battle
[1:14:12] spilled over into the earth and those
[1:14:13] demon spirits got in people
[1:14:15] that's what brother branham taught us
[1:14:17] all right antifa is a modern word but
[1:14:19] it's
[1:14:19] it's the same old same old devil
[1:14:23] so we get so sticky when we're away from
[1:14:26] his presence now that's a big one
[1:14:28] there's a weapon coming into his
[1:14:30] presence you know why you're here today
[1:14:31] to sharpen your weapon sometimes your
[1:14:35] weapon needs some maintenance
[1:14:37] that's why you come together we come we
[1:14:39] gather together in a building
[1:14:41] to get our weapons maintenanced
[1:14:45] so we get sticky when we're away from
[1:14:48] the presence of love
[1:14:50] because the reality is that we live
[1:14:54] in a sinful flesh with a sinful mind
[1:14:58] amen i'm trying to move this up because
[1:15:01] i'm keep getting wind noise in it
[1:15:03] so i think you can hear me all right
[1:15:04] with it at that level okay good
[1:15:10] so the 10 senses as we said just as we
[1:15:13] were
[1:15:13] getting started the 10 senses
[1:15:18] uh that we're born in they they remain
[1:15:21] perverted i'm sorry i'm not trying to
[1:15:24] insult you to say
[1:15:26] you have a perverted mind
[1:15:29] i'm i'm not trying to insult you that
[1:15:31] your imagination is perverted
[1:15:35] your memories your conscience your
[1:15:37] reasonings
[1:15:39] they are subject to perverse thoughts
[1:15:43] perverse notions perverse ideas
[1:15:46] you'll never get faith in your heart to
[1:15:48] be perverted
[1:15:50] because that's only god brother brandon
[1:15:52] said in the heart there's only one or
[1:15:53] two it's either faith or doubt
[1:15:55] it's either the the fallen condition
[1:15:58] you're born in
[1:15:58] in that case it's dark it's of the devil
[1:16:01] or it's born again
[1:16:03] and it's god and in there there is no
[1:16:07] doubt but in my mind i can reason the
[1:16:09] word of god away and end up
[1:16:11] with a reasoned out word of god that's
[1:16:14] not anything like the word of god
[1:16:17] the devil can can
[1:16:20] work through my eyes if i'm not careful
[1:16:24] and make and and my eyes gaze at
[1:16:27] something
[1:16:27] and then the devil come and anoint my
[1:16:29] imagination
[1:16:31] amen you understand and brother branham
[1:16:34] talks about that and he says the natural
[1:16:36] progression of that
[1:16:37] he says you and he says you thinking
[1:16:40] you're just thinking this is all it is
[1:16:42] you haven't done anything
[1:16:43] he said you you men you see some
[1:16:45] half-dressed woman out on the street
[1:16:47] and you get thinking maybe i could make
[1:16:48] a date with her see you get thinking
[1:16:52] he said it'll cost you your soul boy
[1:16:55] amen she's she's uh she's
[1:16:58] she's there she doesn't realize it maybe
[1:17:00] she'll get saved somewhere down
[1:17:02] the road but until she done until she
[1:17:04] does she's a weapon
[1:17:06] in the hands of satan
[1:17:09] come on we're going to be real today oh
[1:17:12] it's going to get more real
[1:17:13] amen you good all right
[1:17:19] here's a second thing that i have from
[1:17:21] spurgeon today i thought it was ironic
[1:17:22] i'd find that one this morning
[1:17:25] i pulled this out of some of his memoirs
[1:17:27] says virgin
[1:17:28] says
[1:17:32] speaking of the bride of christ
[1:17:37] he says when she has not been ashamed
[1:17:41] to put the cross in the forefront
[1:17:45] and she has never had to be ashamed
[1:17:49] of that the bride of christ listen
[1:17:52] friends
[1:17:53] i know the world might sneer at you
[1:17:56] but you got nothing to be ashamed
[1:17:59] of putting the cross of christ in front
[1:18:01] of somebody
[1:18:03] you ought not to be backwards or
[1:18:05] embarrassed over that
[1:18:07] see the crucified you say oh
[1:18:10] well but the crucified christ might
[1:18:14] might get me rejected might get you
[1:18:16] laughed at it might
[1:18:17] also because the crucified christ
[1:18:21] also has irresistible
[1:18:25] do attraction understand that if god is
[1:18:27] trying to pull somebody out of the world
[1:18:30] the best thing you can present them with
[1:18:33] is a crucified christ
[1:18:36] because that that has such a such a
[1:18:39] a pull on a man's heart who already
[1:18:43] feels guilty about his sin because he
[1:18:46] knows he's wrong
[1:18:48] and then you begin to tell him about how
[1:18:50] that god loves him anyway
[1:18:52] and that god came down and took on the
[1:18:54] form of sinful man
[1:18:56] and died on a cross so he would never
[1:18:58] have to and took every sin he's ever
[1:19:00] committed
[1:19:01] and pitched him off in the sea of
[1:19:02] forgetfulness i'm here to tell you
[1:19:04] that's an attractive message
[1:19:07] don't ever think it's not just because
[1:19:10] you see someone
[1:19:11] brother branham you might see a
[1:19:13] prostitute on the street corner brother
[1:19:14] branham said how do you know
[1:19:16] which all she might need is an
[1:19:18] invitation
[1:19:19] to church a handshake to say god bless
[1:19:24] you young lady
[1:19:25] let me invite you to church i can tell
[1:19:26] you about somebody who can change your
[1:19:27] life
[1:19:28] take you off of the street corner make a
[1:19:29] real lady out of you she might not want
[1:19:31] that but she might
[1:19:34] see
[1:19:37] so spurgeon says the crucified christ
[1:19:39] has irresistible attraction
[1:19:42] i love this term never heard it the city
[1:19:44] of man's soul
[1:19:48] the city of man's soul is captured
[1:19:51] before the siege begins when the prince
[1:19:54] emanuel
[1:19:55] uncovers the beauties of his dying love
[1:19:58] before the eyes of the rebellious ones
[1:20:01] catch it again the city of man a man's
[1:20:05] soul
[1:20:05] the city of man soul is captured before
[1:20:08] the siege begins
[1:20:09] when the prince emanuel uncovers the
[1:20:11] beauties of his dying love
[1:20:13] before the eyes of the rebellious ones
[1:20:16] christ
[1:20:16] is drawing all peoples to himself
[1:20:19] by the power of love
[1:20:23] brother brahm said it was the greatest
[1:20:24] power on earth the only crime spurgeon
[1:20:27] concludes
[1:20:29] the only crime that could ever be
[1:20:32] laid to jesus's charge was that of
[1:20:36] loving beyond all reason
[1:20:39] and beyond all bounds
[1:20:43] so he says to us today let me let me let
[1:20:46] you hear his words
[1:20:47] from hundreds of years ago hear the
[1:20:49] words of this great servant
[1:20:51] always keep a dying christ to the
[1:20:54] forefront
[1:20:55] the cross without christ is no cross at
[1:20:59] all
[1:21:00] amen
[1:21:03] so love you know friends love is the key
[1:21:07] to eternal life
[1:21:09] love is the key to eternal life it's
[1:21:12] it's love is how a church stays unified
[1:21:17] i mean you know it's think about the
[1:21:21] possibilities of the devil when a
[1:21:24] a corporal body of people
[1:21:28] come in a corporate environment and all
[1:21:32] come together
[1:21:33] and we all got it we're all different
[1:21:36] we all got different backgrounds from
[1:21:38] different places
[1:21:40] different you know raising different
[1:21:43] preaching that we heard in years past
[1:21:45] and now yet we've got the the uh the
[1:21:48] amazing task to come together
[1:21:50] and we're we're compelled that come
[1:21:53] together
[1:21:54] first come together and be in one mind
[1:21:58] and be in one accord fallen humans from
[1:22:01] every diverse aspect of life
[1:22:04] i mean the the whole smorgasbord the
[1:22:07] merry-go-round of life
[1:22:08] and we all going to come together really
[1:22:11] and all of us are going to
[1:22:12] are going to lay aside all of our
[1:22:15] idiosyncrasies and we're going to be in
[1:22:17] one mind and one accord
[1:22:18] so that god can have so that god can be
[1:22:21] preeminent
[1:22:22] i'm here to tell you you can never do
[1:22:24] that the only one that can do that is
[1:22:26] love when the love of god is shed abroad
[1:22:29] jesus said if i be lifted up i'll draw
[1:22:32] oh men to me
[1:22:36] i don't need to draw men to me i need to
[1:22:39] draw men to him
[1:22:41] and the best way for me to do that is to
[1:22:44] let him live inside me
[1:22:46] but a lot of good it does him to give
[1:22:48] you the new birth
[1:22:49] if you put him and make him sit in a
[1:22:51] corner
[1:22:52] thank you for my new birth now please
[1:22:54] sit still and don't interfere with my
[1:22:55] life
[1:23:00] did you know he'll do that brother brad
[1:23:03] that's
[1:23:04] that's a quote brother branham said he
[1:23:06] he
[1:23:07] he wants all of you but he'll take
[1:23:09] whatever you give him
[1:23:11] he says as much as you will get out of
[1:23:13] put the world out
[1:23:14] and make room for him he'll fill that
[1:23:16] spot
[1:23:17] he won't force he won't kick any of your
[1:23:19] doors in but as much as you will make
[1:23:22] room for him he'll occupy it
[1:23:24] see he loves his family but his desire
[1:23:27] has never been
[1:23:28] okay you're born again see on the other
[1:23:30] side his whole purpose was so that you
[1:23:32] could be
[1:23:33] a conduit between heaven and earth
[1:23:36] see so
[1:23:39] a lot of times you know when we the
[1:23:41] bible says
[1:23:43] you know bring every thought subject
[1:23:45] because you're going to have a bunch of
[1:23:46] them
[1:23:47] and you've got to bring them subject to
[1:23:50] the word of god
[1:23:51] because the devil is always going to be
[1:23:53] trying
[1:23:54] to fill our mind with thoughts that are
[1:23:57] contrary to his word
[1:23:58] and we have to stay unified you know we
[1:24:02] as as a church here here's a here's
[1:24:05] something i'm sure
[1:24:06] everybody will own this this is just a
[1:24:09] fact
[1:24:10] we can we can become critical of others
[1:24:14] who don't walk like we walk who don't
[1:24:17] observe their christianity exactly like
[1:24:19] i do
[1:24:19] and buddy let me tell you i happen to
[1:24:21] know that my way's the perfect way
[1:24:23] and y'all just need to be like me
[1:24:28] but come on isn't that easy don't we
[1:24:31] have to guard against that
[1:24:33] come on humans come on don't we have to
[1:24:35] guard against that
[1:24:36] and sometimes we don't guard against it
[1:24:38] and then you know what happens criticism
[1:24:40] starts
[1:24:41] i'm glad that we've been largely free of
[1:24:43] that 25 years
[1:24:45] i i appreciate in in some cases brother
[1:24:48] branham said the church will take the
[1:24:49] spirit of its pastor
[1:24:50] people think that's always a bad thing
[1:24:51] it's not always a bad thing if if the
[1:24:53] pastor is a gentle loving kind
[1:24:55] affectionate man then the church will
[1:24:57] take that spirit and i'm glad
[1:24:59] i'm glad that you love one another and
[1:25:01] that you love me and we're all in this
[1:25:03] together and we're like one big family
[1:25:05] i love it thank you thank you thank you
[1:25:08] those
[1:25:09] are watching today who weren't allowed
[1:25:10] to be here god blessed you for that
[1:25:13] i'm so proud of that it makes me feel
[1:25:16] like because i i feel like i've hardly
[1:25:17] done nothing for the lord but at least i
[1:25:19] can point the devil
[1:25:20] and say devil look at them they love one
[1:25:23] another they love me
[1:25:26] and even even when we get away from our
[1:25:30] prayer time get away from our gathering
[1:25:32] come on come on
[1:25:34] sometimes we let the the affairs of the
[1:25:36] world we're not supposed to get tangled
[1:25:37] up but we do
[1:25:40] and we get a little sticky and we get a
[1:25:43] little critical
[1:25:45] we still love one another we're just
[1:25:47] being sticky
[1:25:49] and you're not supposed to do that but
[1:25:52] you have to take
[1:25:53] steps to not do that
[1:25:56] it's not a magic wand or pixie dust
[1:25:59] you have to take steps to
[1:26:02] to let the love of god reign supreme
[1:26:07] we get critical of others who don't walk
[1:26:10] like we walk who don't
[1:26:12] praise how we think they should praise
[1:26:22] you know people we've had over the years
[1:26:26] every kind and
[1:26:30] i'm glad that the ones that were
[1:26:32] ordained to be here
[1:26:33] will be here amen and the ones that
[1:26:36] ordained to be somewhere else are
[1:26:37] somewhere else
[1:26:40] because my ministry can't feed the world
[1:26:44] i'm glad that god gave me some people to
[1:26:46] preach to
[1:26:47] amen praise god
[1:26:50] but you know there's people who who
[1:26:53] don't even attend this
[1:26:54] church any longer who who
[1:26:57] who have got angry and stormed out of
[1:27:00] the building
[1:27:01] angry because a song was sung they
[1:27:04] didn't like
[1:27:07] a song because it wasn't
[1:27:10] the way they were raised it wouldn't be
[1:27:13] a song they don't think that song should
[1:27:15] be
[1:27:15] chosen do you you want me to tell you a
[1:27:17] little secret y'all might not know
[1:27:18] because you're not a pastor
[1:27:20] did you know that in my experience every
[1:27:22] pastor i've ever met without the
[1:27:24] exception of one
[1:27:25] has had that kind of problem in his
[1:27:26] church amen
[1:27:30] some of the some of the schisms that get
[1:27:32] started in churches i can tell you
[1:27:35] 60 to 70 of the time conservatively
[1:27:38] is over the disagreement about a song
[1:27:43] does that shock you i'm telling you it's
[1:27:45] the truth
[1:27:46] in my experience and the experience of
[1:27:48] other pastors i talk to
[1:27:50] i've talked to pastors who you know i
[1:27:52] could name them they're very well known
[1:27:53] around the world have churches much
[1:27:55] larger than this one
[1:27:56] have have told me and said you know i
[1:27:59] had a situation
[1:28:00] where i i needed to make a change but i
[1:28:03] had to be careful because
[1:28:04] this person is strategic and and
[1:28:08] and yeah i need to do it but if i do it
[1:28:10] the wrong way i'm going to injure 9 or
[1:28:12] 10 or 11 other people
[1:28:14] so i got to be really prayerful on how i
[1:28:16] go about it you'd think
[1:28:18] man pastor just do it and this was a
[1:28:21] senior pastor to me saying no you don't
[1:28:23] you don't just do it
[1:28:26] you're dealing with people you got to be
[1:28:27] careful you got to consider yourself
[1:28:31] see oh y'all didn't know that kind of
[1:28:33] stuff goes on in churches did you
[1:28:34] [Laughter]
[1:28:36] probably because we're so perfect we
[1:28:38] don't deal with that
[1:28:40] we ain't we something
[1:28:46] oh they they didn't want to hear a song
[1:28:49] that was sung
[1:28:52] you know we're we're different
[1:28:56] come on aren't we
[1:29:00] we got i was in the in the musicians
[1:29:02] meeting the other day we were talking
[1:29:03] about this very thing and i said and i
[1:29:05] started comparing
[1:29:06] i said look at our look at we got four
[1:29:08] worship leaders and they're all as
[1:29:10] different as knight is from day they
[1:29:12] don't they're not anything alike
[1:29:14] i said you know some of them are are
[1:29:17] yankees
[1:29:18] i said you know brother kenny we pretty
[1:29:20] much made him into a southern
[1:29:21] southern gentleman brother brad was a
[1:29:23] super yankee and so
[1:29:25] it's took we've had to work on him and
[1:29:27] he's he's turned into a complete
[1:29:30] southern cream puff
[1:29:34] he's got that southern charm to him amen
[1:29:37] sister rebecca sent me a check for that
[1:29:38] one
[1:29:39] amen no she didn't really brother matt
[1:29:43] brother anthony completely different
[1:29:46] in their styles one from another and
[1:29:49] you're all different one from another
[1:29:51] we're all different but we all love the
[1:29:53] lord
[1:29:55] see you know a lot of times crowd
[1:29:58] mentality crowd mentality let me call it
[1:30:00] that
[1:30:00] where everybody just okay what's the
[1:30:03] crowd let me just take the crowd
[1:30:04] mentality you know
[1:30:06] crowd mentality is where driven cattle
[1:30:09] find
[1:30:09] comfort driven cattle find comfort and
[1:30:13] crowd mentality what's everybody doing
[1:30:15] okay let me just do that
[1:30:16] you know but but you know if you start
[1:30:19] messing
[1:30:20] with our you know we we get this idea
[1:30:23] hey
[1:30:23] let's everybody just be alike okay
[1:30:26] because if you start messing with our
[1:30:28] with our mold then then we start getting
[1:30:30] uncomfortable
[1:30:32] we get end up being around people who
[1:30:34] are different than
[1:30:35] us i'm going to keep preaching y'all
[1:30:38] might as well just stay right with me
[1:30:42] i'm going to keep this smile on my face
[1:30:44] the whole time
[1:30:47] because you know why my face is smiling
[1:30:48] because my heart is
[1:30:50] i mean that very sincerely i mean that
[1:30:55] i said to the lord if you want me to
[1:30:56] preach something like this you're going
[1:30:57] to put a smile in my heart
[1:31:02] so a lot of times when we start messing
[1:31:04] with our church mold
[1:31:06] people get their mold messed with you
[1:31:08] know everybody just needs to get in my
[1:31:10] mold
[1:31:13] you know some people are northern some
[1:31:15] people are southern some people are
[1:31:16] western we talked about
[1:31:18] brother dale leading singing here and
[1:31:19] brother dale was as redneck western
[1:31:21] jarhead as you can get
[1:31:23] doesn't sing very good but one of my
[1:31:25] favorite song leaders in the world
[1:31:28] because you just get bowled over by
[1:31:31] brother dale's sincerity
[1:31:33] he loves god he just starts singing and
[1:31:36] sometimes he's off key and out of tune
[1:31:38] and
[1:31:38] has to joanne or deb has to help him and
[1:31:41] but oh
[1:31:41] he loves worshiping god
[1:31:44] it ain't like i worship god i wish i
[1:31:47] could worship god like that
[1:31:49] amen so we
[1:31:53] sometimes we get out of our mold you
[1:31:56] know they
[1:31:56] they don't they don't come right out and
[1:31:58] say it a lot of times but
[1:32:00] but the feeling that often gets
[1:32:02] projected is you know why must you be
[1:32:05] different
[1:32:05] why can't you just be like i am
[1:32:10] well you don't know the cost of the oil
[1:32:14] in my alabaster box
[1:32:17] you don't know you weren't there
[1:32:20] when he when jesus found me you weren't
[1:32:24] there when
[1:32:24] when the lord wrapped his loving arms
[1:32:26] around me you don't know the cost of the
[1:32:28] oil in my alabaster box
[1:32:32] let me be who i am let me love him for
[1:32:35] how i love him
[1:32:36] let me worship him in spirit and in
[1:32:39] truth according
[1:32:40] to the feeling of my heart
[1:32:44] people get so judgmental people get so
[1:32:46] critical i say you weren't there
[1:32:49] you don't know you don't know you say i
[1:32:51] don't think you should
[1:32:53] you should sing like that well you don't
[1:32:54] know you weren't there when jesus found
[1:32:56] me you don't know what i came from
[1:32:58] maybe you were raised in a cloistered
[1:33:00] environment i wasn't
[1:33:03] see not speaking of me i'm speaking the
[1:33:05] third person
[1:33:06] and and people get so judgmental because
[1:33:08] people aren't like they
[1:33:10] are and i just say god has a bouquet of
[1:33:12] people
[1:33:13] and he saves them from the uttermost to
[1:33:15] the gutter most
[1:33:16] and he brings them from near and far
[1:33:19] hallelujah
[1:33:20] jesus has a table spread where the
[1:33:22] saints of god are fed
[1:33:24] he invites all of his chosen people come
[1:33:26] and dine
[1:33:29] don't judge me by your experience
[1:33:32] you weren't there the night jesus found
[1:33:34] me
[1:33:36] as the cece winans sings you
[1:33:40] you did not feel what i felt when he
[1:33:42] wrapped his loving arms around me
[1:33:45] you know what that woman wanted when she
[1:33:48] brought that alabaster box and
[1:33:51] brother branham said she went into that
[1:33:53] store and took all of her earnings and
[1:33:55] she said
[1:33:56] he'll know where i got this money
[1:33:59] he'll know what kind of woman i am he'll
[1:34:01] know this is dirty money
[1:34:04] but i don't care and she walked in and
[1:34:06] piles it down
[1:34:07] i want the best that you have
[1:34:11] and brother branham said give him your
[1:34:13] best
[1:34:14] he he don't make him second said jesus
[1:34:18] don't want to be second and he don't
[1:34:20] deserve to be
[1:34:22] second give him your best
[1:34:26] don't put him down the list of
[1:34:27] priorities in your life he needs to be
[1:34:29] the top priority
[1:34:31] he needs to be the center the hub of
[1:34:33] every spoke of your life
[1:34:35] [Music]
[1:34:39] if you want a a smooth perfectly round
[1:34:42] wheel
[1:34:42] don't dent the spokes
[1:34:46] that thing a wobble jesus wants to be
[1:34:49] the center hub with
[1:34:51] perfect spokes reaching out to every
[1:34:53] facet of your life
[1:34:54] so that you roll smoothly through life
[1:35:00] what we need a lot of times friends what
[1:35:03] we need if we're honest if we're honest
[1:35:04] how many want to be honest
[1:35:06] what we need sometimes is a fresh dose
[1:35:09] of the love of god
[1:35:11] in our hearts
[1:35:16] we're not to get entangled as paul said
[1:35:18] wow
[1:35:19] if there was ever a time that has an
[1:35:21] enticement to get entangled it's now
[1:35:23] with this political environment
[1:35:25] we're looking at it it's hard to resist
[1:35:29] come on let's on it you get involved it
[1:35:32] gets your dandruff you want to say
[1:35:33] something

[1:41:39] you'll do also
[1:41:41] i've looked in the mirror and said shame
[1:41:42] on you and then i looked back in the
[1:41:43] mirror and said thank you for saying
[1:41:45] that yeah
[1:41:46] amen amen and the next image in the
[1:41:50] mirror was me on my knees
[1:41:52] the love of god has been shed abroad
[1:41:58] so much has happened when listen friends
[1:42:02] let me just ask you some gentle
[1:42:04] questions
[1:42:06] these are the questions the lord asked
[1:42:08] me
[1:42:10] when does love silence our human
[1:42:12] reasoning
[1:42:14] when does it silence our out-of-control
[1:42:18] human emotions when does love finally
[1:42:21] put that down
[1:42:25] amen i don't you say well what's the
[1:42:28] answer
[1:42:29] well i know what i'm praying i'm saying
[1:42:31] lord
[1:42:32] every hour of every day let love
[1:42:35] put my emotions to silence let love
[1:42:39] put my human reasoning to silence
[1:42:42] when does love live in us
[1:42:46] and set aside our rights when are you
[1:42:48] willing to say
[1:42:50] not my will i'm not here for my rights
[1:42:53] i'm here the son of man came not
[1:42:56] to be served but to serve
[1:42:59] the son of man came not to be ministered
[1:43:02] to
[1:43:03] but to minister
[1:43:09] all those kinds of human right demands
[1:43:12] and our incredulous reactions
[1:43:15] do you know where that comes from your
[1:43:17] other nature yeah
[1:43:19] amen i read you a quote just a couple
[1:43:21] maybe several services ago
[1:43:22] i don't have it in front of me but
[1:43:24] brother branham talks about when you go
[1:43:25] off into those kind of tangents and
[1:43:27] things like that
[1:43:28] and he said you're living in your other
[1:43:30] nature
[1:43:32] he said you're letting the flesh control
[1:43:34] your mind your reasonings your actions
[1:43:36] and your reactions and it's almost
[1:43:37] always
[1:43:38] our reactions more than our actions that
[1:43:40] get us in trouble
[1:43:42] it's the easiest one to step out and
[1:43:44] displease the holy ghost and
[1:43:46] send the dove spirit to a limb to wait
[1:43:48] on you to calm down
[1:43:50] it's from the fallen side of you
[1:43:55] you know i see i won't change gears i've
[1:43:58] about locked you up with that one let me
[1:43:59] let me change gears might get worse
[1:44:06] my heart's still smiling
[1:44:09] i see but jason what do you see in all
[1:44:13] this global pandemic
[1:44:15] i see a divine work of god
[1:44:20] in this global pandemic say wow brother
[1:44:23] jason i know you're always the half
[1:44:26] glass half full guy i know you always
[1:44:28] try to find a silver lining around the
[1:44:30] darkest cloud and you're right and i do
[1:44:32] and i think that's a better way to live
[1:44:33] i'd rather believe the best
[1:44:35] and if i get wrong well get found out
[1:44:37] wrong that i'm just wrong but i'd rather
[1:44:39] believe the best
[1:44:41] i'd rather hope that it'll get better
[1:44:43] amen
[1:44:46] and and i i would rather i would rather
[1:44:49] let the weak say i'm strong
[1:44:51] amen so i see
[1:44:55] a silver lining i know the covenant 19
[1:44:59] is the work of the devil i get that
[1:45:00] i get that god don't put sickness on his
[1:45:03] people
[1:45:04] it's a work of the devil but i see god
[1:45:07] remember the bible says that all things
[1:45:09] work together for
[1:45:10] our good god will even take bad things
[1:45:13] and make them work together if you'll
[1:45:14] just be patient and trust him
[1:45:18] and to me say what possible silver
[1:45:22] lining can you see
[1:45:23] and the global pandemic of covet 19 well
[1:45:26] once again
[1:45:28] i see it that god has shown to us
[1:45:31] shown his love to us in that
[1:45:35] you know one of the things he's taught
[1:45:36] us and i was just
[1:45:38] like a little kid in a candy shop to
[1:45:40] realize this
[1:45:41] that our spirituality isn't bound
[1:45:45] to church schedule alone
[1:45:50] you can't even come but to have the
[1:45:51] services if you wanted to
[1:45:54] you understand i i'm i'm i've it's been
[1:45:58] such a release for me to to not just
[1:46:01] let my emotions you know fall into grand
[1:46:04] canyon because so and so didn't where
[1:46:07] was so and so why
[1:46:08] why weren't they in church oh my
[1:46:09] goodness for years i've
[1:46:11] those kind of things bother you because
[1:46:12] you put in so much work and
[1:46:14] you you you know you you want to see a
[1:46:16] dividend come back and
[1:46:18] and and when you don't you get all
[1:46:20] twisted up but you know what i've seen i
[1:46:21] found out that
[1:46:22] that when this global pandemic hindered
[1:46:25] our gathering
[1:46:26] you know what we found out uh we we and
[1:46:29] we so needed to find out
[1:46:31] was that when we were hindered from from
[1:46:33] coming here
[1:46:34] you know what we did we just increased
[1:46:36] his presence in our homes
[1:46:38] we we increased we increased it in our
[1:46:40] homes we increased it in our daily lives
[1:46:42] and we found out that coming in these
[1:46:45] four walls isn't the end-all
[1:46:48] it's a tool it's a weapon but i got a
[1:46:50] whole arsenal of weapons
[1:46:51] and maybe i needed to find out that that
[1:46:54] that i can't depend on coming to this
[1:46:56] building two times a week
[1:46:58] maybe i need to increase make my home a
[1:47:01] church
[1:47:01] make my life a church
[1:47:05] because it might get worse before it
[1:47:07] gets better and it may never get better
[1:47:12] even cut off from one another we found
[1:47:15] new ways to grow
[1:47:16] spiritually right in the midst of
[1:47:18] something that satan intended for our
[1:47:20] harm
[1:47:22] i'm gonna tell you something friends
[1:47:23] today if you have
[1:47:25] found a way to increase your
[1:47:26] spirituality with coming to church
[1:47:28] less and you've found a way to increase
[1:47:30] your spirituality
[1:47:32] you get to laugh in the devil's face
[1:47:36] and you are to make it a belly laugh a
[1:47:39] big one that he can hear running away
[1:47:44] you know he say is there a precedent for
[1:47:47] that you know sure
[1:47:48] sure sure there is that when daniel and
[1:47:50] his companions
[1:47:52] stepped out in faith and they stopped
[1:47:54] eating
[1:47:55] the healthy nice good nutritious food
[1:47:57] from the king's table
[1:47:58] and they ate this little bit of almost
[1:48:01] nothing food
[1:48:02] and the steward who was over them he
[1:48:05] wanted to let him do it
[1:48:06] and he said but you're going to get me
[1:48:07] killed if you show up to the king after
[1:48:09] this
[1:48:10] after this many days and and you're pale
[1:48:13] because you haven't been eating i'm
[1:48:14] going to have my head took off because
[1:48:15] i'm supposed to take care of you
[1:48:16] and daniel said don't worry said let me
[1:48:19] and my brothers
[1:48:20] stop eating the dainties of his table
[1:48:23] and eat our own simple food that god
[1:48:24] provides
[1:48:25] and then you examine us in seven days or
[1:48:27] ten days or however many days it was
[1:48:29] and when he came back to examine them
[1:48:31] their cheeks were more rosy
[1:48:34] they were their their flesh was more
[1:48:36] supple it was
[1:48:37] they were they had increased so let me
[1:48:41] tell you something friends
[1:48:42] that that that that you know it god has
[1:48:46] ways to supply his family god knew we
[1:48:48] would end in a pandemic
[1:48:50] god knew that we wouldn't all be able to
[1:48:52] meet like we always have
[1:48:55] but god has made a way there's my silver
[1:48:58] lining
[1:48:58] what silver lining i have found other
[1:49:01] ways to be more spiritual
[1:49:03] because i realize now i couldn't rely on
[1:49:05] coming to a four wall building as much
[1:49:07] as i used to
[1:49:10] see i wasn't going to be able to get all
[1:49:12] your licks of fire gathered around me at
[1:49:14] once
[1:49:15] we can't do it
[1:49:24] but that silver lining hasn't applied to
[1:49:26] everybody
[1:49:30] it hasn't been the story for some of
[1:49:32] god's family
[1:49:33] i hope you heard how i said that god's
[1:49:35] family
[1:49:37] i'm still giving you credit for being in
[1:49:39] god's family
[1:49:41] i'm just saying you might have missed
[1:49:43] the silver lining
[1:49:44] and so the the pandemic that satan
[1:49:47] brought
[1:49:48] boy he's wiped you out with it when it
[1:49:51] need not have been
[1:49:53] god provided a way that you could turn
[1:49:54] it around on him and make it a weapon of
[1:49:56] victory
[1:49:57] but you didn't do it you played into the
[1:50:00] way of the pandemic satan
[1:50:02] hoped it would work on you
[1:50:09] the coronavirus has certainly taken its
[1:50:11] physical toll we've talked about that
[1:50:13] but
[1:50:15] and even some in god's family we've
[1:50:18] talked about that
[1:50:20] but many more who never caught the
[1:50:23] physical sickness have been
[1:50:24] devastated by the spiritual impact
[1:50:28] devastated
[1:50:32] for the most of us it's been a great
[1:50:34] learning experience a great
[1:50:36] growing experience in god but for some
[1:50:38] it's been just the opposite and that's
[1:50:40] sad
[1:50:41] that's sad satan i'm sad to say today
[1:50:46] that satan has been fabulously
[1:50:49] successful
[1:50:50] in damaging some of your spiritual walk
[1:50:55] sapping you of your spiritual strength
[1:50:58] he's managed to
[1:50:59] fill you with more carnality than you
[1:51:01] already had
[1:51:02] before the pandemic and all that's
[1:51:05] happened now
[1:51:06] because you don't even you don't even
[1:51:08] use the weapon of coming to church
[1:51:10] half the time amen
[1:51:14] see and we even we even have social
[1:51:16] distancing and we wear masks
[1:51:19] and we have hand sanitizers and this is
[1:51:21] one of the safest places
[1:51:23] you could be in
[1:51:27] and he's been fabulously he's he's
[1:51:29] managed to fill up your life with more
[1:51:31] carnality he's kept you from the house
[1:51:33] of god
[1:51:34] more successfully than than at any time
[1:51:37] in your christian experience
[1:51:39] why have you let him do that amen see
[1:51:43] say you're preaching to us we're sitting
[1:51:45] here well i'm not just preaching to you
[1:51:47] i'm preaching to an audience there and
[1:51:48] i'm preaching on an archive that goes
[1:51:50] around the world
[1:51:54] he's kept you from the house of god more
[1:51:56] successfully
[1:52:00] in extreme love in a
[1:52:04] and a i'm going to have a fit of extreme
[1:52:06] love here
[1:52:08] because it's difficult to say these
[1:52:11] kinds of things
[1:52:13] but i i work for somebody
[1:52:16] and i don't get a choice
[1:52:21] so let me say it as gently
[1:52:25] don't get up and go get a lemonade
[1:52:27] please
[1:52:28] don't cut me off don't and you can still
[1:52:31] sit there and cut me off don't cut me
[1:52:32] off in your mind
[1:52:34] i'm trying to help you
[1:52:37] so let me just say gently
[1:52:41] and kindly with love
[1:52:45] you've decided that you won't go to
[1:52:47] church
[1:52:49] fear anxiety carnality
[1:52:55] i i'm angry over my civil rights being
[1:52:57] violated
[1:52:58] we got it all other people just like
[1:53:02] i just don't like going to church so i'm
[1:53:04] just going to use this for an excuse to
[1:53:05] not
[1:53:06] i'd rather go do something else
[1:53:10] and you don't avail yourself of this
[1:53:12] great weapon that god has given us even
[1:53:14] with a 50
[1:53:16] schedule you still go to work
[1:53:20] say oh i can't come to church it's not
[1:53:22] safe

[1:53:50] like going to department stores when
[1:53:51] there was no pandemic
[1:53:56] oh here's going to be a big one because
[1:53:58] 75
[1:53:59] of the men in the church know i'm
[1:54:00] talking to them you still go to
[1:54:02] contractor supply stores
[1:54:06] you still work inside customers homes
[1:54:11] you stop on the street and talk to
[1:54:13] people
[1:54:15] but you won't come to church
[1:54:20] you forfeit a major weapon
[1:54:24] okay oh my little honey pies
[1:54:30] my darlings in the gospel let me give
[1:54:33] you
[1:54:34] a very sincere benefit of the doubt and
[1:54:36] acknowledge i'm gonna let's take the
[1:54:38] fear side for a minute
[1:54:40] let's acknowledge maybe you have a very
[1:54:43] real
[1:54:44] fear maybe has nothing to do with
[1:54:45] carnality maybe i'm completely off base
[1:54:47] on that
[1:54:47] maybe you're listening to this sermon
[1:54:49] right now and saying but jason it's not
[1:54:51] that you got me wrong
[1:54:52] well you know i i really have a a fear
[1:54:56] and and and and and i don't now
[1:55:00] if you say it's a real fear okay i don't
[1:55:04] i don't then i don't understand why you
[1:55:05] can do all those other things
[1:55:08] but let me give you some grace and
[1:55:10] acknowledge that you may have an
[1:55:12] authentic fear that i just can't
[1:55:13] understand here's what i can say to help
[1:55:16] you because i'm only trying to help
[1:55:18] you how many believe that
[1:55:22] this is a very relevant sermon friends
[1:55:23] we don't know what's going to happen
[1:55:24] tomorrow
[1:55:26] i do know what i i can predict the fit
[1:55:28] the future
[1:55:29] if you give me a six-month window i can
[1:55:32] tell you with 100
[1:55:33] certainty say
[1:55:36] okay what's it going to be worse than it
[1:55:38] is
[1:55:41] worse than it is if you give me
[1:55:44] 12-month window i can give you 100
[1:55:46] certainty it's going to be
[1:55:48] much worse than it is
[1:55:52] here's what i can say to help you
[1:55:55] if you do have a genuine fear though i
[1:55:57] can't understand that because
[1:55:59] you still go to those other places but
[1:56:02] here's what i can say satan gave you
[1:56:05] that fear
[1:56:07] that's a hundred percent sure satan gave
[1:56:10] you that fear
[1:56:11] he's filled you with fear
[1:56:14] amen hold on hold on hold on
[1:56:18] you allowed it
[1:56:21] he gave it to you and you allowed it
[1:56:25] a spirit of fear did not come
[1:56:28] from god we're not given the spirit of
[1:56:33] fear we're given the spirit of a sound
[1:56:36] mind
[1:56:39] it came from satan who
[1:56:42] showed up with the delivery and you
[1:56:45] signed for it amen
[1:56:50] i'll tell you your future by the word
[1:56:54] i'm not a prophet
[1:56:56] now hear me this line's heavy
[1:57:00] but i'm going to tell you your future
[1:57:04] if you don't soon return to cinder
[1:57:08] on that package you're going to find
[1:57:11] that what you
[1:57:11] signed for you agreed to a lifetime
[1:57:15] payment plan
[1:57:18] and when you're gone and not and not
[1:57:21] here anymore your children will still be
[1:57:22] paying those payments
[1:57:24] your children's children will continue
[1:57:26] making those payments
[1:57:28] i'm here to tell you you'll never pay it
[1:57:31] off
[1:57:32] the interest alone will bury you bury
[1:57:35] your children
[1:57:36] bury your children's children if the
[1:57:38] lord should tarry
[1:57:39] oh friends throw it off today we're not
[1:57:42] giving the spirit of fear we're giving a
[1:57:45] sound mind we're given the mind of
[1:57:47] christ
[1:57:49] it's going to get much worse if you're
[1:57:51] if you can't run with the footman how
[1:57:53] you going to handle the horse
[1:57:55] [Music]
[1:57:59] where is the thankfulness that's what
[1:58:02] i'd like to ask some people
[1:58:03] who just don't even come back to church
[1:58:06] anymore
[1:58:08] where is the thankfulness to the lord
[1:58:10] for his blessings on you
[1:58:15] i still got a few minutes where just ask
[1:58:19] yourself now think friends because i'm
[1:58:20] not browbeating you
[1:58:22] i'm asking you to think this is just
[1:58:23] brother jason saying think about it
[1:58:26] okay where is the thankfulness to the
[1:58:30] lord
[1:58:31] for his blessings on you amen
[1:58:34] i see you living in nice homes i see you
[1:58:37] growing your business
[1:58:38] making money raising kids happy and
[1:58:42] blessed of god
[1:58:43] i see him pouring showers of blessing on
[1:58:46] you
[1:58:47] drenching you in success
[1:58:50] amen where is coming to the house of god
[1:58:53] just to return thanks for that
[1:58:57] just as a testimony among the saints
[1:59:02] too many i'm afraid
[1:59:05] are not allowing the lord to be more in
[1:59:08] their lives
[1:59:09] like kovid taught us we could do coven
[1:59:12] 19
[1:59:13] taught us he could be more in our homes
[1:59:15] sadly in some cases he's not
[1:59:17] covered 19 taught us he could be more in
[1:59:19] our lives and needed to be
[1:59:20] and in some cases that's not the case
[1:59:25] he can be more in your homes more in
[1:59:27] your families
[1:59:29] and and we've realized it and we needed
[1:59:31] to we needed to realize it
[1:59:33] and i but my fear is that you haven't
[1:59:35] realized that because i don't
[1:59:37] see you even willing to come to the
[1:59:39] house of god and let your light
[1:59:41] shine amen
[1:59:44] say brother jason they might close the
[1:59:46] doors to that church down and we
[1:59:48] could never come back there again well
[1:59:51] then those who have
[1:59:52] made their homes a sanctuary in their
[1:59:54] lives of sanctuary will be okay
[1:59:56] you'll get worse and worse and worse
[1:59:59] because you haven't learned to do it
[2:00:00] during the footman
[2:00:02] how are you going to do it during the
[2:00:03] horseman see
[2:00:09] gather you know not willing to gather
[2:00:12] with the body of christ
[2:00:15] which he told us through paul that we
[2:00:17] needed to do
[2:00:18] amen we needed to do more as we see the
[2:00:20] day approaching
[2:00:22] i i i don't even see you gathering it
[2:00:24] for no other reason than
[2:00:26] just for thankfulness for his blessings
[2:00:29] wow that's tough ain't it you say you
[2:00:33] don't you don't know pastor
[2:00:35] you're judging me you're judging me
[2:00:41] you could be right maybe i could be
[2:00:47] or maybe maybe it's that you just need
[2:00:49] to stop lying to yourself
[2:00:54] amen telling yourself that you're okay
[2:00:58] maybe you're not okay
[2:01:03] maybe i'm right oh yes
[2:01:06] see
[2:01:09] sold out christians come together
[2:01:12] sold out christians sing songs of
[2:01:15] worship together
[2:01:16] sold out christians praise god together
[2:01:19] hear the word together
[2:01:21] say amen together pull on the preaching
[2:01:23] together
[2:01:25] adam where art thou adam
[2:01:28] it should have been the opposite it
[2:01:31] should have been adam hearing him come
[2:01:32] and running lord help me
[2:01:34] but instead he ran the other way and
[2:01:36] he's hiding in god in his love
[2:01:39] god in his love adam today has chased
[2:01:41] you into your living room saying where
[2:01:43] are you son
[2:01:45] where's your home where's your family
[2:01:47] what about your kids
[2:01:52] oh my you might need to stop drop and
[2:01:55] roll
[2:01:57] oh yes amen might need to run as
[2:02:00] fast as you can to an altar
[2:02:04] don't pass go one more time around the
[2:02:06] board don't collect another 200
[2:02:08] of god's blessings go directly to an
[2:02:11] altar
[2:02:12] and pray and stay there
[2:02:16] until you fill back up with the fire you
[2:02:18] once
[2:02:19] knew hallelujah
[2:02:23] amen we i'm i'm closing i'm not going to
[2:02:26] get finished i can already see
[2:02:27] i'm just going to stop we are going to
[2:02:31] need
[2:02:32] these weapons finely tuned
[2:02:35] love faith
[2:02:38] prayer gathering all they'll let us
[2:02:42] while they'll let us we need to do it
[2:02:46] we need to be building our homes into
[2:02:48] sanctuaries building our lives into
[2:02:50] sanctuaries
[2:02:50] because they've already limited us to
[2:02:52] half and it might get worse
[2:02:54] we have had times where it was zero and
[2:02:56] only a preacher and a broadcast crew
[2:02:58] what if we go back to that
[2:03:00] where's your homes where's your heart
[2:03:02] where's your mind
[2:03:03] what's your life what's your activities
[2:03:06] come on i see the blessing of god
[2:03:07] reigning on you where's the gratitude
[2:03:09] back to god for that
[2:03:14] we're going to need the power of love
[2:03:16] and the weapon of prayer
[2:03:18] this world is in a chaotic time
[2:03:21] but sometimes friends the greater truth
[2:03:25] is that we're the one in the spiritual
[2:03:27] chaos
[2:03:29] of our innermost being
[2:03:33] so you ask yourself you you see
[2:03:36] you've let me just type the natural to
[2:03:38] the spiritual you got another three
[2:03:39] minutes five minutes
[2:03:41] you see it like i see it we see the
[2:03:43] chaos on the streets
[2:03:45] the madness the rioting the looting i
[2:03:48] get that they've hijacked peaceful
[2:03:49] demonstrations i get that some people
[2:03:51] were there for peaceful demonstrations
[2:03:52] that's their american right
[2:03:53] soldiers bled i've stood in i've stood
[2:03:56] in the graveyard
[2:03:57] in the philippines and seen white rose
[2:04:00] you talking you think if you've ever
[2:04:02] been to washington dc and i have and
[2:04:03] ever been to arlington and i have
[2:04:05] it almost i know it sounds crazy it
[2:04:08] almost can't compare to the one that
[2:04:10] they've got in the philippine islands
[2:04:13] that one is just rolling hills and
[2:04:15] rolling hills and as far as the eye can
[2:04:18] see
[2:04:18] of white crosses and star of david where
[2:04:21] men bled out there and we're buried
[2:04:23] there
[2:04:23] never got never even come back home
[2:04:27] some of their remains just some of them
[2:04:28] are just a a marker so
[2:04:31] many men and and service people and
[2:04:34] women included even back in world war ii
[2:04:36] and nurse corps and and things like that
[2:04:38] gave their lives
[2:04:40] so that people could peacefully
[2:04:42] demonstrate and address their grievances
[2:04:45] to the government i like what a federal
[2:04:47] judge says he said you ought to be
[2:04:49] standing on the steps
[2:04:51] shouting your grievances not shouting at
[2:04:54] the building and trying to burn it down
[2:04:57] that's not what the fathers had in mind
[2:05:01] to redress grievances
[2:05:05] we see the chaos
[2:05:10] in the world right now we see a portrait
[2:05:15] of fallen flesh and fallen mind
[2:05:18] and we see as i said this this spiritual
[2:05:21] warfare these demons that are working in
[2:05:23] those people
[2:05:24] who are just sheer anarchists don't even
[2:05:26] have a cause
[2:05:28] they're just full of the devil and have
[2:05:30] hijacked
[2:05:32] noble call noble uh uh
[2:05:35] demonstrations and have hijacked it
[2:05:39] and the devil has so captured and i'm
[2:05:42] not here to argue
[2:05:43] the politics of it i already told you i
[2:05:44] don't care about it anymore
[2:05:48] but what what but what i do see is
[2:05:50] something that informs my thinking about
[2:05:53] my own fallen flesh
[2:05:55] if it's not brought under the love of
[2:05:57] god now that's the point i'm making
[2:06:02] we see the characteristics of these
[2:06:05] following
[2:06:05] fallen elements they know no restraint
[2:06:10] they resist all authority
[2:06:14] rebellious to all instruction
[2:06:18] say yeah we need to put them in prison
[2:06:22] well let me tell you something this
[2:06:24] whole idea
[2:06:25] of knowing no restraint and resisting
[2:06:28] all authority
[2:06:29] and rebellions to all instruction and
[2:06:31] injuries to all things that are good
[2:06:34] this is the wretched man that paul said
[2:06:36] i
[2:06:37] am amen amen i'm that way you're that
[2:06:41] way
[2:06:42] we're no different than them you'd be
[2:06:44] right out there with them but why aren't
[2:06:45] you the love of god has constrained you
[2:06:48] but don't be fooled and think you're not
[2:06:51] still in a fallen condition
[2:06:52] don't go thinking you don't need to pray
[2:06:54] and read your bible and come to church
[2:06:56] don't go thinking that you don't need to
[2:06:58] hear the preaching
[2:07:01] because paul said i'm still a wretched
[2:07:04] man
[2:07:04] in my members there's no good thing amen
[2:07:12] when he he did what a lot of us need to
[2:07:15] do he took a full dose of honest
[2:07:17] introspection in the presence of god
[2:07:20] that's a fancy word we used to call it
[2:07:22] soul-searching
[2:07:25] back in the time of our innocence and we
[2:07:27] were
[2:07:28] fresh minted christians hallelujah
[2:07:33] we're going to need the weapons of our
[2:07:36] warfare friends

[2:08:00] an altar where's your family in relation
[2:08:02] to the spirituality
[2:08:03] that god has exposed that we could have
[2:08:07] and satan brings in covet 19 locks the
[2:08:09] world down and god goes
