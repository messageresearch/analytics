[7:53] the God of all power. Let's pray.
[7:57] Lord, I pray that you would use my lips

[8:06] that the power of the Holy Spirit

[8:15] May she be able to rest. Father, Lord,

[8:19] healed.
[8:21] Father,
[8:22] healing is a process. We look to you,
[8:25] Father. Lift her up before you, Father,
[8:28] in the name of Jesus Christ. Give her
[8:31] sleep. Give her rest. Give her strength,

[8:37] requests upon the hearts today,
[8:40] Father. It's not a flesh and blood
[8:42] battle, but prince of powers of the air.
[8:47] But you are the God of all power.
[8:50] I love you this morning. I thank you for

[9:58] again.
[10:01] [Music]
[10:03] What will it be like?
[10:07] When my pain is gone
[10:11] and all the wories of this world just
[10:15] fade away.
[10:19] What will it be like
[10:23] when you call my name?
[10:27] In that moment when I see you face to
[10:32] face.
[10:33] [Music]
[10:35] I'm waiting my whole life for that day.
[10:43] And I will live my life to hear you say,
[10:50] "Well done. Well done,
[10:55] my good and faithful one.
[10:59] Welcome to the place where you belong."

[11:32] when tears are washed away
[11:36] and every broken thing will finally be
[11:40] made whole?
[11:43] Oh, what will it be like when I come
[11:47] into your glory?
[11:50] Standing in the presence of a love so
[11:55] beautiful,
[11:57] [Music]

[12:18] good and faithful one.
[12:22] Welcome to the place where you belong.
[12:26] [Music]
[12:28] Well done. Well done,
[12:33] my beloved child.
[12:36] For you have run the race and now your
[12:40] home.
[12:42] [Music]
[12:44] Welcome to the place where you belong.
[12:49] [Music]
[12:50] What will it be like
[12:54] when I hear that sound?
[12:59] All of heaven's angels crying out.
[13:05] They're singing, "Holy,
[13:10] holy,
[13:14] holy
[13:16] are you, Lord."

[26:56] Turn around. Shake hands with somebody.
[26:58] Greet them in the name of the Lord. Say,
[27:00] "God bless you, pilgrim." Nicest thing
[27:03] you can say to a believer is, "God bless
[27:05] you." And that carries a lot of weight

[27:10] there's nothing like the blessing of the

[27:41] specials. Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm all

[27:53] working on it. Okay. Hurry up. Don't
[27:55] make me get on you.
[27:58] Amen. Praise the Lord. Um, we want to go
[28:02] by the help of the Lord today into the
[28:05] time of the unsealing part four. I hope
[28:07] to finish the series today. We'll see.
[28:10] But I want to go uh go about it just
[28:12] jump straight in here this morning. We
[28:14] have a number of ministry team members
[28:17] preaching out today. Uh, we're going to
[28:19] be in prayer for them. Brother Amy and
[28:22] us, brother Jesus Jamie headed home
[28:24] today. So, they should get in late
[28:25] tonight. Want to be praying for them,
[28:27] which I've missed them. My goodness.
[28:29] Amen. And I keep looking back there to
[28:30] see them and I just have to visualize
[28:32] they're sitting back there. Praise the
[28:34] Lord. They're not in the audience, are
[28:35] they? Okay. No. Okay. Good. They're
[28:37] coming in tonight as best I can
[28:38] remember. And um others different one
[28:41] other different ones are out ministering
[28:43] today. Praise God. So we're here and uh
[28:47] we love the Lord and love the word and
[28:49] we want to look right into it this
[28:50] morning in Mark's Gospel
[28:54] chapter 1. And I don't remember any
[28:56] other announcements I needed to make and
[28:58] I have no prayer requests that were sent
[29:00] to me this morning. So, let's go right
[29:01] into the word. Mark chapter 1.
[29:05] Um,
[29:08] you know, I I meant to say 11. I'm I'm
[29:11] terribly sorry. I know the Thank you,
[29:13] Buds. Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Noah. You were
[29:15] scrambling, weren't you? Yeah. Okay.
[29:18] Mark 11. Mark 11. Oh, I know now why I
[29:21] why I said Mark one, but we'll get to
[29:24] that shortly. We're going to use it, but
[29:26] you won't have to find it. No, I'm just
[29:28] gonna make a statement about it. Mark 11
[29:32] and verse one uh through six. You have
[29:35] it? Say amen.
[29:36] Amen.
[29:39] And when they came nigh to Jerusalem
[29:42] unto Beth and Bethany, at the Mount of
[29:46] Olives, he sendeth forth two of his
[29:48] disciples,
[29:50] and saith unto them, Go your way into
[29:53] the village over against you. And as
[29:56] soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall
[29:59] find a colt tied, whereon never man set,
[30:03] loose him, and bring him. If any man say
[30:06] unto you, why do you this? Say ye that
[30:11] the Lord hath need of him, and
[30:13] straightway he will send him hither. And
[30:16] they went their way, and found the colt
[30:19] tied by the door, without in a place
[30:22] where two ways met, and they loosed him.
[30:24] And certain of men that stood there said
[30:26] unto them, "What do you loosing the
[30:28] colt?" And they said unto them, even as
[30:32] Jesus had commanded, and they let him
[30:34] go. Amen. Let's pray.
[30:39] Father, we thank you for your word this
[30:42] morning.
[30:44] You see the purpose in my heart, Lord,
[30:46] and I'm standing here this morning to
[30:48] try to keep my mind very tightly
[30:51] controlled and concentrating on the
[30:54] leadership of the Holy Spirit. I pray
[30:56] that you will grant it to me today Lord
[30:59] that the word can go forth unhindered by
[31:02] the human instrumentality. Give give
[31:05] blessing to the speaker. Give blessing
[31:07] to the hearers. We commit it to you in
[31:09] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[31:12] You can be seated.
[31:16] So they let them go as soon as they gave
[31:18] them the word of the Lord.
[31:21] Amen. It's amazing. You know, sometimes
[31:24] we we can read certain things and we,
[31:28] you know, can wonder at at God's
[31:31] movements. I remember years ago when I
[31:35] studied, and I know it's unusual to see
[31:37] me with multiple screens, but I have
[31:39] something I'm going to try to do today
[31:40] if I can not uh mess it up, but um um I
[31:45] just thought it might be easier on me to
[31:47] do it this way. So, we'll see. Amen. I
[31:50] I'm going to largely ignore you today. I
[31:53] hope that doesn't offend you. But I I've
[31:56] just got to keep you blocked out and my
[31:59] worries that you know that uh you know
[32:01] what do you got to do today and you got
[32:03] to be there and so that doesn't mean I'm
[32:05] going to preach a marathon sermon. It
[32:07] just means that I'm going to concentrate
[32:09] on what uh and and I and and to do it
[32:12] the way I'm going to do it and jumping
[32:14] to this, I'm going to have to um have to
[32:18] just stay very very focused right here.
[32:20] Amen. You don't have to be afraid. Amen.
[32:23] Those of you who if we've got any
[32:25] visitors, I'm not a long-winded
[32:26] preacher. Um but uh I def I definitely
[32:29] would like to get all my thought out
[32:31] today by the help of the Lord. We kind
[32:33] of going to do it in a little bit of a
[32:35] strange way that I've been actually
[32:36] telling you about. We did it once before
[32:38] and it went really well where we took
[32:40] the story brother Random on his hunt,
[32:42] you know, to for the caribou caribou and
[32:44] the grizzly. And so today we've been
[32:47] talking about bringing him uh into the
[32:49] woods. We're going to go into the woods
[32:51] today with brother Brandon. That be all
[32:52] right.
[32:53] Amen. Praise the Lord. It's going to be
[32:56] uh quite a ride. So just hang on. We're
[32:58] going to say some things today that we
[33:00] hope are as uh astonishing to you as
[33:03] they have been to me. Uh I think that
[33:06] that's necessary. I think the word
[33:07] should impact you.
[33:09] You know, I think it should be more than
[33:10] just a dry letter. I think it should
[33:12] have something behind it. And I don't
[33:14] just mean, you know, high octane
[33:16] preaching. High octane preaching will
[33:18] entertain me for about 15 minutes and
[33:20] then you better have something to say.
[33:22] And so we're not interested in just high
[33:24] octane delivery. Uh but we we want to
[33:27] really I love that but we want to make
[33:29] sure that we get into the word and and
[33:32] make it effectual to you. Amen. Because
[33:35] it is the effectual fervent prayer that
[33:38] avails. See and so when we when we are
[33:42] looking at this thought today uh I'm
[33:44] trusting the Lord that he will grant it
[33:47] to me the way that it came to me that I
[33:50] can deliver it to you. And so I, as I
[33:52] was saying, I remember studying the word
[33:55] of God as a very young man, began
[33:58] studying the word very young. Uh even as
[34:00] a boy, you know, learning the Bible at
[34:03] the knee of my mother who told me the
[34:05] Bible stories and thrilled my young
[34:07] heart. Oh my goodness, what a
[34:10] storyteller Sister Jean is.
[34:12] Incidentally, she's getting ready to do
[34:13] her third part to her testimony. So,
[34:16] we're going to be very excited about
[34:17] that. And uh I think that's next week.
[34:20] Hey, Sister Mom. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[34:22] So looking forward to that. She's been
[34:24] working on it a lot. And uh but I but
[34:27] even even beyond that as I that put a
[34:30] love for the word of God in my heart and
[34:32] I I you know I studied it from very
[34:34] young. I you know you know even as a
[34:37] young teenager.
[34:39] I would head off into the woods with my
[34:41] dogs and my Bible and go to my praying
[34:43] place and the place where I would spend
[34:45] time with the Lord. It was in that very
[34:47] place that a a rushing wind blew through
[34:49] in an impossible place where no wind
[34:51] could come and blew my Bible open as I
[34:54] was praying with my Bible on my knees. I
[34:57] was on my knees and you know sitting in
[34:59] a back and I had it on me on my knees
[35:01] and my legs and the wind come rushing
[35:03] through and I'm praying. I had my hands
[35:05] up and I'm praying about my ministry.
[35:08] Lord, what is this call on my life?
[35:10] You've dealt with me since I was a child
[35:12] and you know this call to the ministry.
[35:15] you know, is this a call to the
[35:16] ministry? And and and and and as I had
[35:20] my hands up, my eyes were closed. True
[35:22] story. And all of a sudden, this wind
[35:23] came in in an impossible situation. If
[35:26] you'd have saw where I was, you could
[35:27] have walked right past me. You'd have
[35:29] never knew I was in there. And and and
[35:32] the wind comes and I could hear my my my
[35:36] pages going,
[35:38] "WELL, I love my Bible. I didn't want
[35:40] the pages to tear." And so, as I'm
[35:42] praying, I just put my hand to keep it
[35:44] from ripping. and finish my prayer.
[35:46] Lord, what is this about my life? And I
[35:48] opened my eyes and looked down. But you
[35:50] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost
[35:52] has come upon you, and you shall be a
[35:54] witness unto me in Jerusalem, Judea,
[35:56] Samaria, the uttermost part of the
[35:58] earth. And so, Amen. Well, there was no
[36:02] getting out of it then.
[36:04] Amen. So we but I I I I I I said all of
[36:08] that to say that you know I as I as a
[36:11] young student of the scriptures many
[36:14] times I would come across passages that
[36:16] would just leave me astonished and I
[36:18] would just think you know wow that is
[36:20] just strange that's not how it's not
[36:23] what I would have expected you get
[36:25] people asking God questions they'll come
[36:27] to Moses hey we got a situation you know
[36:30] there's no specific law written out you
[36:32] haven't give us any instruction this
[36:34] just kind of just jumped up and uh we
[36:36] need the Lord to advise us. And Moses
[36:38] would say, "Okay, I'll go pray. I'll
[36:40] take your question to the Lord." And
[36:42] then and sometimes I remember in those
[36:44] early days, I would say, "I wonder what
[36:47] the answer's going to be." And I would
[36:49] just be like a kid in a candy shop
[36:51] waiting. I'm reading and reading and
[36:52] reading and here comes the answer of the
[36:54] Lord back. And I'm like, "Wait, what?
[36:58] THAT'S THAT'S THE ANSWER? WOW, THAT'S
[37:01] NOT THE ANSWER I WAS EXPECTING." AND YOU
[37:03] KNOW, GOD DOES IT like that. You're
[37:06] going to see today, you know, a prophet
[37:09] have to go through that. And the reason
[37:10] that I'm doing that
[37:13] is because we're living in the day when
[37:16] everything that you see happening in the
[37:18] lives of the people in the Bible,
[37:20] including all the way up and including
[37:22] the prophet of this age. You're going to
[37:24] find that that was all building a road
[37:27] map for you right now.
[37:29] Amen. And those things that were
[37:31] happening even when we talk about the
[37:33] third pull in brother Brandham's
[37:35] ministry you have five instances six if
[37:38] you count the squirrels twice which it
[37:40] did happen twice once in Indiana once in
[37:42] Kentucky one was red squirrels one was
[37:44] gray squirrels a smaller species and uh
[37:47] but but we find that he said now it's
[37:49] just to identify its presence among you
[37:51] it's not going to be used in a great way
[37:53] until you know other things have to
[37:55] catch up we've kind of ran out ahead of
[37:57] the program and you can't run ahead of
[37:59] God's program so we've We got to drop
[38:00] back. Carry on preaching. Carry on in
[38:03] evangelism. We got to wait for this
[38:05] other. What other? The ecumenical
[38:07] movement, the political movement, the
[38:10] social trends, Satan's Eden, because
[38:12] it's all got to go forward together. We
[38:15] learned that, you remember when we
[38:16] studied the seven vials, we learned that
[38:19] the trumpets and the seals and the vials
[38:20] and the woes and they all were in a
[38:22] cluster and they were all overlapping
[38:24] and connecting one to another and
[38:26] advancing and it all kept advancing
[38:28] together. And so I'm here to tell you,
[38:30] we we finally have to hit a place,
[38:32] friends, where we, you know, we got to
[38:34] stop saying when the squeeze comes, I
[38:36] mean, it's here.
[38:40] You know, A REVIVAL'S COMING. IT'S HERE.
[38:43] THERE'S GOING TO BE A GREAT POWER OF
[38:44] GOD, A GREAT SWEEP, A GREAT A FRESH
[38:46] SURGE. I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S FALLING.
[38:48] NOW,
[38:49] YOU SAY, "WELL, I'M NOT SURE I FEEL IT."
[38:51] WELL, WALK OUT ON THE STREET AND LOOK AT
[38:53] THE CRAZINESS
[38:54] BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT IF THAT'S
[38:56] HAPPENING OUT THERE, GOD'S DOING
[38:57] SOMETHING UP THERE THAT'S HAPPENING HERE
[38:59] AMONG US.
[39:02] This is what learning the Bible teaches
[39:04] us. You don't always have to go by
[39:06] experiences and feelings. Away, Brother
[39:08] Brown said, away with experience as your
[39:10] measuring line. See, we don't we don't
[39:12] chase sensations as we were talking
[39:14] about on Wednesday. You know, uh that
[39:17] that this is a walk. This is a daily
[39:19] walk. And why I better get I better make
[39:21] some tracks here. I'm already burning up
[39:22] my time. Brother Brandham makes a
[39:25] statement a couple of statements here in
[39:26] Why Christ speak. I'm not going to read
[39:28] them uh exhaustively, but I'm going to
[39:30] skip through them. He's going back to
[39:33] the time when Moses, you know, uh was
[39:37] anointed with faith and you know, they
[39:39] came to the Red Sea and it's barring
[39:42] their path forward. And Moses comes to
[39:44] the Lord and he's crying and the Lord
[39:45] says, "Why cryst thou unto me? speak and
[39:48] to the children of Israel that they go
[39:50] forward, you know, AND I MEAN, LOOK,
[39:53] YOU'RE YOU CAN PUT YOURSELF right there
[39:55] with Moses. Come on. He was a human
[39:57] being.
[39:58] I mean, if I would have been there, if
[39:59] you would have been there, I'd And THE
[40:01] LORD SAID, "SPEAK AND GO FORWARD."
[40:04] You know, there's an ocean IN FRONT OF
[40:05] ME.
[40:06] YES. GO FORWARD.
[40:09] OKAY, we're going to go forward. How
[40:12] How's this GOING TO WORK? STRETCH OUT
[40:14] YOUR ROD.
[40:15] OH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. SEE, BROTHER
[40:17] BRANDHAM SAID THAT THAT ROD IN THE HAND
[40:19] OF MOSES WAS THE WORD OF GOD IN YOUR
[40:21] HAND TODAY.
[40:22] Said if THEY COULD HAVE EVER GOT THAT
[40:24] ROD AWAY FROM HIM, THEY COULD HAVE
[40:25] WHIPPED HIM. DON'T EVER LET THE DEVIL
[40:27] TAKE THE WORD OUT OF YOUR HAND.
[40:29] SEE, AND HE STRETCHED OUT HIS ROD. YOU
[40:32] GOT A SITUATION TODAY. STRETCH OUT THE
[40:34] WORD. STRETCH I DON'T MEAN THE LETTER. I
[40:36] MEAN FAITH
[40:37] IN THE WORD OF GOD AND SPEAK IT AND
[40:39] CLAIM IT AND PUT THE DEVIL IN HIS PLACE.
[40:44] That's what the third pull's about. It's
[40:46] this power of the spoken word. Now, it's
[40:48] more than that. I'm just going to deal
[40:49] with that aspect of it today. It's souls
[40:51] in prisons, all that. I get that. But
[40:53] but but we're we're speaking about the
[40:55] power of the spoken word that is to be
[40:59] handled hand that's supposed to be hand
[41:01] in the in the hand of the people that
[41:04] that receive the the mystery of the
[41:07] seven thunders, which that's what we
[41:09] have now. Not the little narrow view of
[41:12] the thunders that came on the seven
[41:13] heaven. I ain't talking about that. That
[41:15] was just a little narrow golden pot at
[41:17] the end of the rainbow and people got
[41:18] disillusioned by a lot of that. A lot of
[41:20] truth in it. Tremendous amounts of
[41:22] truth. BUT NOW TODAY WE HAVE THE WHOLE
[41:24] BOUQUET. WE UNDERSTAND IT WAS
[41:26] EVERYTHING.
[41:27] IT WAS THE MIGHTY GOD UNVEILED. IT WAS
[41:29] THE MYSTERY OF GOD. IT WAS THE
[41:31] IDENTIFIED CHRIST OF ALL AGES.
[41:34] SEE, it's the brother Ram called caught
[41:36] it the mystery of God working in his
[41:38] people.
[41:39] See, and that's what was held for all
[41:41] those years. But but the the revelation,
[41:44] the seven thunder revelation under the
[41:46] seals. Once the seals were broken,
[41:47] remember the seals weren't the weren't
[41:50] the message. The seven thunders was the
[41:52] message. The seals bound the message.
[41:55] Nobody could get to it UNTIL IT WAS
[41:56] UNBOUND. AND AND AND the and when THE
[41:59] MESSAGE WENT FORTH, IT WAS THE UNVEILING
[42:01] OF GOD. AND WHEN IT UNVEILED GOD, IT
[42:04] UNVEILED HIS BRIDE. IT UNVEILED
[42:05] REDEMPTION.
[42:07] MY IT GAVE US A PURPOSE. IT'S NO WONDER
[42:09] WE'RE NOT A DENOMINATION.
[42:12] AMEN.
[42:13] Cuz we're we're liquid. We're moving.
[42:15] We're in motion.
[42:16] We're going forward. WE'RE NOT STATIC.
[42:18] WE'RE WE'RE GOING FORWARD FORWARD.
[42:20] FORWARD.
[42:23] SO HE SAYS HERE, NOW WATCH, SEEING THE
[42:25] SCRIPTURE. MOSES SAW IT. IT POINTED
[42:27] RIGHT STRAIGHT TO IT. AND HE and and and
[42:29] THE SPEAKING OF GOD AND HE HAD ALL THESE
[42:32] EVIDENCE. He had the word. He was a he
[42:34] WAS A PECULIAR CHILD. And and he had THE
[42:37] PROMISE. AND GOD HAD SPOKE TO HIM, TOLD
[42:39] HIM TO DO IT. AND AND AND HE SAID,
[42:41] BROTHER M SAID, IT ANOINTED THE FAITH HE
[42:44] HAD IN HIM TO GO TO WORK. That friends
[42:48] is the is the holy grail of why you're a
[42:51] believer.
[42:53] The the that you you don't realize that
[42:55] the the purpose and plan is of God is in
[42:58] you. You have a gene of God in you. And
[43:01] that everything you have need of for a
[43:03] rapture is in you.
[43:05] Amen. And all YOU NEED IS A HAND OF
[43:07] FAITH to make it operate.
[43:10] See, so that becomes THE RUB. OKAY, HOW
[43:13] DO I GET TO THAT? You can't.
[43:17] You have to surrender. He has to do it.
[43:21] You can't chase it.
[43:22] IT'S NOT ABOUT CHASING SOMETHING. It's
[43:25] not about trying to be something or
[43:28] we're GOING TO TRY TO CONJURE UP
[43:29] SOMETHING. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE this
[43:31] thing work. You can't do that. 60 years
[43:34] has proven to us.
[43:35] A LOT OF GREAT MEN ROSE UP THINKING we
[43:38] could do that. WE HAD SOME GREAT NEW MAN
[43:40] AND SOME GREAT NEW MYSTERY AND SOME
[43:41] GREAT NEW CAMP AND WE FIGURED THIS IS
[43:43] GOING TO DO IT. THIS IS GOING TO DO IT.
[43:44] AND ALL IT DID WAS DISILLUSIONED PEOPLE
[43:46] CUZ THEY THEY NEVER THEY IT NEVER DID
[43:48] IT.
[43:49] AND SO 60 YEARS WE'VE GROWN AND WE'VE
[43:51] BECOME A MATURE BRIDE AND WE REALIZE
[43:53] THIS IS HIS DOING.
[43:56] THIS IS HIS GRACE. THIS IS HIS MERCY.
[43:59] MY MY ROLE IS TO SURRENDER MY WAY TO A
[44:03] BODY CHANGE.
[44:06] It anointed the faith he had in him.
[44:08] See, Moses had to get himself out of the
[44:10] way. That's really all he needed to do.
[44:12] Lay down his fears, stop crying, speak,
[44:16] and go forward.
[44:17] See, God was always going to do it. So,
[44:21] BROTHER BRANDHAM USES THAT EXAMPLE OF
[44:23] MOSES. He says, "What ought that to do
[44:25] to us?" Now watch this now because when
[44:29] when when A PROPHET IS IN THIS SERMON
[44:31] WHY CHRIST SPEAKING HE'S TELLING ALL
[44:32] KINDS OF EXPERIENCES. He does it again
[44:34] in in uh in in another message uh speak
[44:37] to the mountain and various other places
[44:39] where he's telling all the these
[44:41] examples of the third pole and it's his
[44:42] new ministry coming and my goodness when
[44:45] he starts telling those STORIES ALL
[44:47] THOSE PENTECOSTALS MAN THE AND BROTHER
[44:49] BRANDHAM WAS ONE OF THEM AND MAN THE
[44:50] HAIR RAISED ON THE BACK OF THEIR NECK
[44:52] DID MINE TOO. I MEAN, JUST listen to it
[44:54] AND AND BY THE TIME IT'S ALL OVER, MAN,
[44:56] THEY'RE READY TO HAVE A ROMP AND STOMP
[44:58] AND JUBILEE. LET'S CLAP AND DANCE AND
[44:59] RUN AND SCREAM AND HOLLER AND SPEAK IN
[45:00] TONG AND LET'S MAKE IT WORK. HALLELUJAH.
[45:02] PRAISE GOD.
[45:03] AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, "WHAT WE NEED
[45:05] IS HE SAYS WHAT IT OUGHT TO DO IS WE
[45:07] NEED A REPENTANCE.
[45:10] WE NEED A REVIVAL." NOTICE HE PREFACED
[45:13] REPENTANCE AHEAD OF REVIVAL.
[45:15] THIS THING AIN'T ABOUT JUST JUST HAVING
[45:17] A A A PEP RALLY AND WORKING US ALL UP
[45:20] INTO A LATHER. THIS IS ABOUT A HUMILITY.
[45:23] THIS IS ABOUT A REPENTIVE HEART. THIS IS
[45:26] ABOUT SINCERITY. THIS IS ABOUT
[45:27] DEDICATION. THIS AIN'T ABOUT YOUR GLORY.
[45:31] THIS IS BRINGING HIM GLORY.
[45:34] HALLELUJAH.
[45:35] IT STARTS, YOU WANT A REVIVAL, IT STARTS
[45:37] WITH REPENTANCE.
[45:39] BROTHER BRANDHAM IS SAYING, I'M SAYING
[45:42] MYSELF.
[45:44] So don't ANYBODY STAY ON YOUR HIGH HORSE
[45:46] today because the prophet is saying, I
[45:48] need it
[45:49] MYSELF. SEE, I NEED A SHAKING. And you
[45:53] can hear all those people. They were at
[45:55] one minute they're just shouting, ready
[45:56] to run around the church. And all of a
[45:58] sudden, everything's getting quieter and
[45:59] quieter. And Brother Brandham is now
[46:01] turning the He's giving them what they
[46:03] didn't expect.
[46:05] YOU I I TELL YOU ABOUT ALL THESE STORIES
[46:07] AND YOU WANT THAT. YES. PRAISE THE LORD.
[46:09] We want that. Let's do it. He says, "All
[46:11] right, it's going to have to start with
[46:12] A REVIVAL." ALL RIGHT. PRAISE GOD. LET'S
[46:14] HAVE ONE. IT STARTS WITH REPENTANCE.
[46:16] AMEN.
[46:17] And then you get the crickets. Amen.
[46:20] See,
[46:22] I'M SAYING MYSELF,
[46:24] I NEED a shaking.
[46:28] ARE WE HONEST ENOUGH SOMETIMES, FRIENDS,
[46:30] TO SAY I NEED A SHAKING, LORD?
[46:32] I NEED SOMETHING. I SAID I WAS SPEAKING
[46:35] TO MYSELF THIS MORNING OR ABOUT MYSELF.
[46:37] I AND I LOVE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES
[46:39] WHERE I LOVE THE FACT THAT THEY LEFT
[46:41] THE, you know, the I I I I IN THERE. HE
[46:43] SAYS, I I I NEED AWAKENING UP. I SAID,
[46:48] "BROTHER BRANDOM, I I NEED I NEED
[46:51] AWAKENING UP THIS MORNING."
[46:54] MOSES WITH HIS GREAT FAITH AGAIN COULD
[46:56] SAY, YOU KNOW, HE COULD SAY NO TO THE
[46:59] PRESENT THINGS OF THE PRESENT world and
[47:02] make a righteous choice.
[47:04] That is the key to opening the Red Sea.
[47:12] Amen.
[47:13] without that in place where he COULD
[47:17] WITH HIS GREAT FAITH SAY WHERE DID HE
[47:19] GET IT? He said no to the present world.
[47:25] He made a righteous choice.
[47:28] Amen.
[47:29] I have been repeating that to you over
[47:31] and over again in this series. This
[47:34] thing isn't about all of us trying to
[47:36] run off halfcocked and all enthused.
[47:39] this we have arrived at Satan's full
[47:42] Eden and we have the power of the spoken
[47:44] word among us but I'm here to tell you
[47:46] it's going to REQUIRE BROTHER BRANDON
[47:48] WAS TOLD YOU'LL HAVE TO BE MORE SINCERE
[47:51] THAN YOU HAVE EVER BEEN IN YOUR LIFE
[47:54] BECAUSE THIS MAMBA THAT'S ON THE LOOSE
[47:56] ONE BITE IS DEATH
[47:58] SO I I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IF THERE WAS
[48:00] EVER A TIME FOR PREACHERS TO BE SINCERE
[48:03] IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME FOR PARENTS TO
[48:05] BE CONSECRATED IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME
[48:07] FOR TEENAGERS TO DEDICATED. I'M HERE TO
[48:10] TELL YOU FRIENDS, YOU YOU HAVE ARRIVED.
[48:12] IT'S GOING OFF A CLIFF AND YOU CAN'T
[48:13] STOP IT.
[48:16] You're either going off the cliff or
[48:18] you're going to go up.
[48:20] See,
[48:22] so if I don't get finished today, I I I
[48:25] it'll be all right. We'll go to part
[48:26] five.
[48:28] I'm not going to rush.
[48:30] Amen.
[48:32] He chose
[48:34] to suffer afflictions with the people OF
[48:36] GOD. HE CHOSE TO GO WITH IT. WHY? HIS
[48:39] FAITH. HE SAW THE PROMISE. HE SAW THE
[48:41] END TIME. I LOVE THIS STATEMENT. HE SAW
[48:43] over into tomorrow. Oh, I have found
[48:47] more strength than that. Let me tell
[48:48] you, I'll testify to you today, young
[48:51] people. You want to know where strength
[48:52] lies? Get your eyes off of this world
[48:55] and start looking to tomorrow. Start
[48:58] looking to the world that's coming.
[49:00] Start living for THAT LIFE. THIS LIFE
[49:02] WILL SEEM VERY UNIMPORTANT TO YOU IF you
[49:04] do that. I'm here TO TELL YOU I'M, YOU
[49:06] KNOW, AND I I WAS EVEN I WAS EVEN
[49:08] LISTENING to to uh to uh um I don't
[49:12] remember how to pronounce his name. Uh
[49:14] Jung, I think is he's a famous uh a very
[49:17] famous uh psychologist, psychiatrist
[49:19] actually. Um he was a a friend of Sigman
[49:22] Freud and and uh you know I I was
[49:24] listening to an to a um a talk he gave
[49:27] and he was talking about the whole
[49:29] aspect of you know looking long range.
[49:33] He said, you know, when people start
[49:34] aging out, he himself was an old man. He
[49:36] said, when they start aging out and they
[49:38] start looking at their end and they fix
[49:39] their eyes, well, there's my end. And
[49:42] he's NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE world to
[49:43] come. He was a great believer in God and
[49:45] he believed in the next world,
[49:47] you know, and so uh very very much uh
[49:49] opposite of Freud in that way. AND SO HE
[49:52] HE ACTUALLY WAS A VERY SINCERE MAN. And
[49:54] he he says, YOU KNOW, THEY THEY LOOK AT
[49:57] THEIR LIFE COMING TO AN END. AND HE
[49:58] SAID, RIGHT AWAY, THEN THEY START
[50:00] GETTING SICK, THEY START AGING OUT, THEY
[50:02] START DYING, THEY START SLOWING DOWN,
[50:04] THEY START crippling over, and the next
[50:05] thing you know, they're just gone. AND
[50:07] THEY SAID, WELL, WHAT SHOULD YOU DO TO
[50:09] DEFEAT THAT? HE SAID, LOOK AT YOUR LIFE
[50:11] GOING ON AND ON AND ON. AND THEY SAID,
[50:15] WELL, HOW LONG? HE SAID, CENTURIES.
[50:17] IMAGINE YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE FOR
[50:18] CENTURIES. PUT THAT LISTEN I AM GOING TO
[50:22] LIVE FOR CENTURIES
[50:24] I'M PUTTING MY MIND IN THAT DIRECTION
[50:27] AND THE MORE I DO THE LESS THIS WORLD IS
[50:30] MEANING TO ME I'VE TURNED MY EYES UPON
[50:34] JESUS
[50:36] THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD HAVE GROWN
[50:38] strangely dim
[50:41] I want more of it I want it for you I
[50:44] want it for your children your families
[50:46] your marriages your homes
[50:49] SO HE SAID THESE ARE THE CHOICES MOSES
[50:52] MADE. HE HE LOOKED PLUM OVER INTO
[50:55] TOMORROW.
[50:56] Prophet says if you look at the present
[50:58] world you make a choice with it.
[51:03] Now if id have said that you'd have a
[51:04] right to go let me think about that.
[51:07] Send me the little emoji of the guy
[51:08] going
[51:10] this is a prophet.
[51:12] There's a prophet saying
[51:15] if you look at the present world people
[51:18] if people could only
[51:20] do that didn't see the present world
[51:22] like Moses if you look at the present
[51:24] world you make your choice with it hide
[51:27] listen HOW A WHAT AN ACTIVE WORD THIS
[51:29] ISN'T PASSIVE HIDE your eyes from THAT
[51:34] AND LOOK AT THE promise way over into
[51:38] tomorrow
[51:40] you KNOW I I SOMETIME IN FACT, I JUST
[51:42] TOOK THAT LITERALLY. I SAID, I'm going
[51:44] to be more careful at what I hide my
[51:48] eyes from
[51:49] and what I open them up to.
[51:51] And I AS SOON AS I STARTED DOING THAT
[51:53] AND STARTED BEING MORE CONSCIOUS ABOUT
[51:55] THE THINGS THAT I GAZE AT, BECAUSE THE
[51:57] BIBLE TELLS US, YOU'RE TRANSFORMED into
[51:59] the things you gaze at.
[52:01] YOU THINK THE DEVIL DOESN'T KNOW THAT
[52:03] WITH SOCIAL MEDIA? YOU THINK HE'S
[52:05] IGNORANT OF THAT? HE invented it.
[52:07] You see, YOU THINK HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT
[52:09] WITH HOLLYWOOD AND BOLLYWOOD AND AND
[52:11] EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON. YOU THINK SATAN
[52:13] DOESN'T KNOW THAT.
[52:15] YOU THINK HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO GET YOU
[52:18] SEE? AND SO I I AND AND AND YOU KNOW
[52:21] WHAT I FOUND? I FOUND A STRANGE THING
[52:23] HAPPENING. THE MORE I TURNED MY EYES
[52:25] TOWARD JESUS, THE MORE I WANTED TO. THE
[52:27] MORE I TURNED AWAY, THE MORE I WANTED TO
[52:29] TURN AWAY. OH, I SAID, "LORD, IF I'M
[52:32] BECOMING A FANATIC, THEN PRAISE THE
[52:34] LORD. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A
[52:36] FANATIC.
[52:37] HALLELUJAH.
[52:39] MY
[52:41] SO HE SAID, "YOU MAKE YOUR CHOICE. LOOK
[52:45] AT THE PROMISE OF GOD WAY OVER INTO
[52:47] TOMORROW. AND IF YOU'RE, YOU KNOW, THERE
[52:48] THERE'S ONLY ONE REAL CHURCH. YOU DON'T
[52:50] JOIN IT. YOU'RE BORN INTO IT.
[52:52] IF YOU'RE BORN INTO IT, THE LISTEN
[52:54] LISTEN. IF YOU'RE BORN INTO IT, NOW THIS
[52:57] ISN'T TRUE IF YOU JUST JOIN ONE.
[53:00] That's just membership. That's not
[53:03] that's not the family of God
[53:05] necessarily.
[53:06] We don't have a membership. You can join
[53:08] here. But he says here, he says if
[53:12] you're if you uh if you don't join it,
[53:16] you're born into it. AND IF YOU'RE BORN
[53:19] into it, the living God works himself
[53:22] through you.
[53:27] Making himself known. Yes. Amen.
[53:31] That's You know why? Because that's
[53:33] where God dwells.
[53:35] Hallelujah.
[53:36] In his church.
[53:38] God, I love this. God goes to church
[53:41] every day.
[53:44] Amen.
[53:44] See, just lives in church. He lives in
[53:50] you.
[53:51] You're his church.
[53:56] He repeats it. You are his church. Say,
[53:59] is that scriptural? You are the
[54:01] tabernacle
[54:03] THAT GOD DWELLS IN. You are the CHURCH
[54:06] OF THE LIVING GOD YOURSELF.
[54:10] SEE, AND IF THE LIVING GOD LIVES in his
[54:15] living being, THEN YOUR ACTION IS OF
[54:18] GOD. IF IT ISN'T, THEN GOD ISN'T IN
[54:20] THERE. HE WOULDN'T MAKE YOU ACT LIKE
[54:23] THAT WHEN HE SAYS IN THE WORD HERE HIS
[54:26] BLUEPRINT, DON'T DO IT, AND YOU GO AND
[54:28] DO IT. SEE, that's wrong. When you deny
[54:30] it, then that shows the life isn't even
[54:33] in you.
[54:36] Now, that's a that's a tough statement.
[54:38] AND YOU KNOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM IS NOT
[54:41] DISMISSING THE fact that you still live.
[54:46] You're a TRIUNE BEING, AND ONLY ONE OF
[54:48] THEM IS IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD. THE
[54:49] other two are still steeped in sin.
[54:52] That's what the Holy Ghost is given for.
[54:54] Out of your belly shall flow rivers of
[54:56] living water the moment you are born
[54:58] again. Your desires change. That's why
[55:00] we read you THAT QUOTE THE OTHER NIGHT
[55:01] AND THE VERY GODLY SISTER. BUT BROTHER
[55:03] BRANDHAM, I MAKE SO many mistakes. But
[55:05] see, SISTER, THAT DOESN'T MATTER. GOD
[55:06] DON'T SEE THOSE. IT'S YOUR HEART, YOUR
[55:08] DESIRE, WHAT YOU WANT TO BE.
[55:10] SEE, I'M THANKING GOD FOR THAT. SO,
[55:13] BROTHER BRANDHAM IS NOT NECESSARILY HERE
[55:15] DEBATING, YOU KNOW, the the gene of
[55:18] election that may be in your may be in
[55:20] you OR EVEN OR EVEN THAT YOU'VE HAD A
[55:22] NEW BIRTH. HE'S NOT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT
[55:24] THE QUOTE ISN'T THAT NARROW. HE'S HE'S
[55:26] LOOKING AT WHERE YOU LIVE.
[55:28] SEE, BECAUSE BECAUSE WHERE YOU LIVE,
[55:33] THAT'S AS FAR AS THE HOLY GHOST CAN
[55:35] OPERATE.
[55:38] You might be A GENE OF GOD. YOU MIGHT BE
[55:39] BORN AGAIN. I WILL SAY YOU'VE HAD A A
[55:41] NEW BIRTH EXPERIENCE BY A REVELATION OF
[55:44] JESUS CHRIST, BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU,
[55:46] YOU'VE GOT TO EMPTY OUT OF THE WORLD.
[55:48] PAUL IS SAYING TO PEOPLE WHO WERE HAD
[55:50] BEEN BORN AGAIN FOR 30 YEARS, AND HE'S
[55:52] SAYING TO THEM, I WOULD THAT YOU BE
[55:54] FILLED WITH ALL THE FULLNESS OF THE
[55:56] KNOWLEDGE OF GOD.
[55:59] AND PETER'S SPEAKING TO A CHURCH THAT
[56:01] HAD THE SAME HOLY GHOST EXPERIENCE HE
[56:03] HAD. HE'S SAYING TO THAT SAME CHURCH WHO
[56:05] HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE HE HAD, YOU NEED
[56:07] TO ADD TO YOUR FAITH AND YOU NEED TO ADD
[56:09] TO YOUR VIRTUE. YOU NEED TO ADD AND ADD
[56:11] AND ADD. YOU YOU NEED TO GROW AND MOVE
[56:13] HIGHER AND HIGHER.
[56:15] SEE?
[56:16] SO,
[56:18] so it's IT'S IT'S WHERE THE HOLY GHOST
[56:20] CAN OPERATE. AND IT'S YOU. CAN I SAY
[56:23] THIS TODAY? IT'S YOU HINDERING HIM,
[56:27] NOT GOD FAILING TO KEEP A PROMISE.
[56:31] I'm here to defend HIM TODAY. I'M NOT
[56:33] GOING TO UH UH I'M NOT EVER WILLING ON
[56:36] THE STREETS AT HOME IN THIS BUILDING IN
[56:39] IN AN INTERVIEW WITH YOU. I'M NOT HERE.
[56:41] YOU WON'T FIND A TOLERANT PASTOR JASON
[56:44] WHO WILL LET YOU BLAME GOD.
[56:47] GOD ALWAYS KEEPS HIS WORD.
[56:50] BUT WE HINDER HIM. IT'S NOT HIM NOT
[56:53] KEEPING HIS WORD. IT'S YOU HINDERING
[56:54] WHAT HE WANTS TO DO IN IN YOUR LIFE.
[56:57] AMEN.
[56:58] YOU HAVE TO ALLOW THE MIND OF CHRIST AND
[57:01] THE WORD TO DWELL IN YOU RICHLY. YOU
[57:03] HAVE TO ALLOW IT TO COME. I MEAN, YOU
[57:06] HAD TO DO THAT TO GET A NEW BIRTH.
[57:08] AMEN.
[57:09] You had to do that to get A NEW BIRTH.
[57:10] YOU HAD TO SURRENDER YOUR OLD LIFE AND
[57:13] SAY AMEN TO THE REVEALED WORD.
[57:15] SEE, SO SO YOU KNOW SAYING AMEN TO THE
[57:20] TO THE WORD AND IF THAT BROUGHT YOU TO A
[57:22] NEW BIRTH THEN THEN THEN THEN I SUPPOSE
[57:25] WHY I WOULD SAY WHY WOULD YOU THEN STOP
[57:27] DOING that
[57:31] and still expecting God
[57:34] to do more in your life?
[57:38] I mean can somebody explain that madness
[57:40] to me? you you let's YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE
[57:44] PAUL SAID TO THE GALATIANS OH YOU
[57:45] FOOLISH Galatians who hath bewitched you
[57:49] know ARE YOU SO FOOLISH HAVING BEGUN IN
[57:51] THE SPIRIT ARE YOU NOW MADE PERFECT BY
[57:53] the flesh have you suffered so many
[57:54] things in vain if it be yet in vain AND
[57:57] THEY WERE BORN AGAIN BY THE SPIRIT OF
[57:58] GOD AND THEY HAD FAITH AND GRACE AND
[58:00] THEY AND SUDDENLY SOMEBODY COMES IN WITH
[58:02] A BUNCH OF LEGALISM AND THEY THINK OH
[58:03] THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET BORN AGAIN
[58:04] AND PAUL SAYS GOOD GRIEF
[58:06] YOU YOU YOU YOU DIDN'T GET BORN AGAIN BY
[58:09] DOING THAT WHY ARE YOU ALL WORRIED ABOUT
[58:11] THAT NOW AMEN.
[58:12] SO, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT A
[58:14] DIRECT PARALLEL, BUT IT'S THE SAME TYPE
[58:15] OF A SITUATION. YOU HAD TO BELIEVE EVERY
[58:18] WORD OF GOD. YOU HAD TO SAY AMEN. YOU
[58:20] HAD TO ALLOW THE MIND. YOU HAD TO ALLOW
[58:22] THE WORD TO DWELL IN YOU RICHLY. THAT'S
[58:24] WHAT GAVE YOU A NEW BIRTH. AND AND AND
[58:26] SO THEN SO THEN SO THEN IF YOU IF YOU
[58:28] STOP DOING THAT, THEN HOW DO YOU HOW IS
[58:31] IT THAT YOU IMPUGN GOD BECAUSE HE'S NOT
[58:34] DOING MORE IN YOUR LIFE?
[58:36] AMEN.
[58:37] AMEN.
[58:39] Am I right or AM I NOT RIGHT? SEE? YEAH.
[58:42] WOW.
[58:43] SO, SO WHEN WE YOU CAN SEE FRIENDS WHY
[58:46] EXACTLY why
[58:48] this series is is really personal to me.
[58:52] So, the third pull AND WE WE TALKED
[58:55] ABOUT THIS in previous lessons. The
[58:58] third previous three um
[59:02] sermons we preached. Third pull we saw
[59:05] it remember prefigured in Genesis.
[59:07] Amen.
[59:08] Because everything is Genesis. Genesis
[59:11] is the seed chapter.
[59:12] And so we we saw Abraham
[59:16] speaking a word that created a
[59:19] sacrifice.
[59:20] Amen. And that's why brother Brandon
[59:22] when he comes out of the woods and ends
[59:23] up in Hadty Wright's house that next day
[59:27] and they're sitting there having had a
[59:29] meal and he's telling the story of the
[59:32] squirrels and here's a poor old woman
[59:37] and she says, "Brother Brandom, that's
[59:39] nothing but the truth."
[59:40] Hallelujah.
[59:41] AND AND BROTHER BRANDHAM, YOU KNOW WHAT?
[59:43] YOU KNOW WHAT HE HAD JUST FINISHED
[59:45] SAYING?
[59:46] HE HAD JUST FINISHED SAYING, "THE ONLY
[59:49] THING I could think it to be would be
[59:51] this." When God was trying to tell
[59:54] Abraham how he was going to bless him.
[59:56] And when he he says, "Take your son,
[59:58] your only son." I mean, this is real
[1:00:01] life.
[1:00:02] This isn't a story. This is real life.
[1:00:05] Take your son, your only son. Didn't
[1:00:07] even acknowledge Ishmael, your only son,
[1:00:11] and
[1:00:12] and destroy him. The son I waited 25
[1:00:15] years for. Yes. The son you've let live
[1:00:17] in my life for all these 11 years and
[1:00:19] now I've my whole heart is in him and
[1:00:21] now this is it.
[1:00:23] Is this a cruel joke? Don't don't think
[1:00:26] of Abraham as some superhuman who didn't
[1:00:28] have feelings.
[1:00:30] See, but but but this was a man who was
[1:00:34] who had trained himself for years to
[1:00:38] walk by faith.
[1:00:41] And Paul picks it up. And I'm glad we
[1:00:43] had a prophet Paul who could do it and
[1:00:46] shows how that Abraham, this is what
[1:00:48] Abraham figured. He gave him to me from
[1:00:50] one who really I couldn't have a son. I
[1:00:53] was as good as dead. My wife was as good
[1:00:54] as dead. So I surmise that if I do
[1:00:58] sacrifice HIM, THE LORD WILL RAISE HIM
[1:01:00] UP BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY TOLD ME THIS IS
[1:01:02] THE PROMISED SON UPON WHICH THE SANDS of
[1:01:04] the sea THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH GRAINS OF
[1:01:06] SAND TO EQUAL THE AMOUNT OF MY
[1:01:08] OFFSPRING. AND THE STARS OF HEAVEN DON'T
[1:01:11] CONTAIN. SEE? AND SO ABRAHAM KNEW. SO BY
[1:01:14] FAITH HE PUT DOWN EVERY HUMAN SENSE AND
[1:01:18] REASONING AND OBEYED GOD.
[1:01:20] AMEN.
[1:01:21] SEE, AND HE SAYS HERE THE THE THING THAT
[1:01:25] ABRAHAM NEEDED. SEE, SO ABRAHAM HAD
[1:01:28] SAID, "THE LAD AND I SHALL go and the
[1:01:31] lad and I shall return." He's got a
[1:01:32] command to go kill him. He said, "And we
[1:01:34] shall return." Yeah. Amen.
[1:01:36] And when he and when you remember we
[1:01:38] dealt with this, I think in part one or
[1:01:39] part two. And Isaac said, "Father,
[1:01:41] behold the wood. Behold the fire.
[1:01:44] Behold the wood." But where's the lamb?
[1:01:46] And Abraham speaks. See, third pull.
[1:01:48] Brother Ram ties it right back to that.
[1:01:50] He said, Abraham needed what Abraham
[1:01:52] needed was a sacrifice instead of his
[1:01:55] son.
[1:01:56] Amen.
[1:01:57] Oh, you talk about being being invested
[1:01:59] in this God, the one who had made him a
[1:02:02] promise years before. And now the thing
[1:02:05] he loves more than his own life, TH THIS
[1:02:07] TREASURED CHILD, A A PROMISE OF GOD THAT
[1:02:11] HE HAD WAITED SO LONG TO SEE. AND NOW
[1:02:13] THE THE THE THE VERY TREASURE OF HIS
[1:02:16] HEART, HIS LIFE IS ON THE LINE. LISTEN,
[1:02:20] FRIEND, SAY, "BROTHER JASON, WHY IS THAT
[1:02:21] SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?" BECAUSE THAT'S
[1:02:23] WHERE I LIVE.
[1:02:24] I GOT LOVED ONES AND I HEAVEN WOULDN'T
[1:02:27] BE HEAVEN WITHOUT THEM. AND I CAN'T
[1:02:28] IMAGINE NOT HAVING MY HERITAGE. AND AND
[1:02:32] I AND I I NEED A SACRIFICE. I NEEDED
[1:02:34] SOMEBODY WHO COULD COME AND SPEAK A
[1:02:36] WORD. I NEEDED A GOD WHO COULD GIVE A
[1:02:39] PROMISE AND SPEAK A WORD AND IT COME TO
[1:02:42] PASS.
[1:02:43] AND IT WOULDN'T MATTER WHAT HAPPENED IN
[1:02:45] THIS LIFE. NO POWER ON ON EARTH. NOT
[1:02:48] ENOUGH DEVILS CAN STOP ME OR THE PROMISE
[1:02:50] THAT GOD GAVE ME.
[1:02:53] HALLELUJAH.
[1:02:54] AMEN.
[1:02:55] THAT'S WHERE I LIVE.
[1:02:57] AMEN.
[1:02:58] MY I NEED A I NEEDED A GOD who could
[1:03:01] speak a word.
[1:03:03] Yes.
[1:03:04] So the DAY OF ABRAHAM HAS COME AGAIN.
[1:03:08] Impossible situations face me.
[1:03:10] Impossible situations face you.
[1:03:14] But we were given a promise in the word.
[1:03:18] But but we can't make it happen.
[1:03:21] But there's one among us
[1:03:23] who can make it happen.
[1:03:28] We have been there as parents and
[1:03:29] grandparents and looked at situations
[1:03:31] and it broke our heart and we we bled
[1:03:35] tears constantly
[1:03:37] and there was nothing we could do but
[1:03:39] pray and love and pray and love and pray
[1:03:42] and love. We were powerless to do
[1:03:44] anything else. I needed a God who could
[1:03:47] come and speak a word. I needed a word
[1:03:50] that could overstep every devil. I
[1:03:52] needed a word that could SUBDUE UH THE
[1:03:54] HEART OF OF A YOUNG MAN OR A YOUNG
[1:03:56] WOMAN. WE'VE NEEDED IT AND GOD HAS
[1:03:58] PROVIDED IT. AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE
[1:03:59] AFRAID TODAY. I WANT YOU TO TAKE EVERY
[1:04:01] PART OF YOUR INHERITANCE AND SAY, "IT'S
[1:04:03] MINE AND I'M A BELIEVER IN THE WORD OF
[1:04:06] GOD. I DON'T CARE WHAT I SEE."
[1:04:09] THERE'S NO CIRCUMSTANCE THAT CAN STOP
[1:04:11] GOD'S PROMISE TO ME. AMEN.
[1:04:13] SEE,
[1:04:16] SO WE SEE IT IN ABRAHAM, THE SIGN OF THE
[1:04:18] SON OF MAN, which of course connects us
[1:04:21] right to Luke 17 in the days of the son
[1:04:24] of man. So, SO, SO, SO THAT'S HOW WE
[1:04:28] know because THAT'S HOW WE KNOW THAT
[1:04:31] WHERE WE ARE. THAT'S HOW I CAN SAY TO
[1:04:35] YOU THE WORLD IS PLUNGING INTO MADNESS
[1:04:38] BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN
[1:04:39] ABRAHAM'S day in the son of man.
[1:04:41] Amen. and he went down to Sodom. THAT
[1:04:44] WAS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WHAT WE FIND
[1:04:46] HAPPENING THAT JESUS PROPHESIED IN LUKE
[1:04:48] 17 that as it WAS IN THE DAYS OF NOAH
[1:04:52] and that was the world being destroyed
[1:04:55] as it was in the days of Lot and WE SEE
[1:04:57] HOW THAT DESTRUCTION WAS COMING AND THAT
[1:05:00] AS THE WAS IN THE DAYS OF ABRAHAM IT'S
[1:05:02] GOING TO BE IN THE DAYS WHEN WHEN THE
[1:05:04] WORLD IS GOING INTO CHAOS AGAIN
[1:05:06] WHEN THE WORLD IS BEING DESTROYED IT'S
[1:05:08] TEETERING ON THE BRINK AND ABOUT TO GO
[1:05:10] OVER THE EDGE AND THE WHOLE THING IS
[1:05:12] DISINTEGRATING. OH, BUT I'M HERE TO TELL
[1:05:14] YOU, I GOT A JOURNEY THAT I'M HEADED
[1:05:16] UPWARD. I'M NOT HEADED DOWNWARD. I'M
[1:05:18] HEADED UPWARD, ONWARD, AND UPWARD.
[1:05:24] SEE,
[1:05:25] SO I I KNOW WHERE I AM. SO, SO NOW WE
[1:05:28] KNOW THAT THAT THAT'S WHEN THE POWER WE
[1:05:31] KNOW BY THE BIBLE THAT THIS IS WHEN THE
[1:05:33] POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD WAS TO BE among
[1:05:35] us
[1:05:36] like it was in Abraham,
[1:05:39] like it was in Jesus. He stepped up to a
[1:05:41] tree and said, "No man eat from thee
[1:05:44] from this day."
[1:05:46] And and
[1:05:48] brother Ram said, "You know, when he
[1:05:50] first spoke it, it looked like anything
[1:05:51] happened." You ever done that?
[1:05:55] Believed God? Absolutely.
[1:05:57] Knew you had a revelation from God and
[1:05:59] spoke it, nothing seemed to happen. He
[1:06:02] says, "But way down in the roots where
[1:06:04] no one could see, it started to die."
[1:06:08] And once that cycle of death set in
[1:06:10] there, it didn't take too long after
[1:06:12] that friends. Oh my. See, so
[1:06:17] so so WE CAN SEE THEN that we know that
[1:06:20] THIS IS THE TIME WHEN THIS power
[1:06:23] of the spoken word operating perfect
[1:06:26] faith. WE KNOW THAT THAT'S TO BE IN
[1:06:29] OPERATION. PERFECT FAITH BECAUSE IT'S
[1:06:32] THE MIND OF CHRIST. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT
[1:06:33] POINT.
[1:06:35] PERFECT FAITH FOR YOU TO SPEAK THE WORD
[1:06:38] IS NOT YOUR HUMAN FAITH DECIDING WHAT TO
[1:06:41] SAY.
[1:06:42] AMEN. IS THAT'S WHAT PUZZLED BROTHER
[1:06:44] BRANDON WHEN HE WHEN HE WOULD GO to to
[1:06:47] Mark 11 we we didn't go we didn't READ
[1:06:49] IT ALL BUT WHEN HE WOULD GO TO MARK 11
[1:06:51] AND HE SAID IF YOU say to this mountain
[1:06:54] because you KNOW HE CURSES A TREE AND
[1:06:55] THEY SAID THE NEXT DAY MASTER LOOK AT
[1:06:57] look at this it's dying and he said you
[1:06:59] know DON'T DOUBT BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAY
[1:07:01] EVEN IF YOU SAY TO A mountain be cast in
[1:07:03] the sea don't doubt IN YOUR HEART BUT
[1:07:05] BELIEVE WHAT YOU'VE SAID YOU'LL HAVE it
[1:07:08] and brother Brandham said you know he
[1:07:09] said I couldn't I couldn't understand
[1:07:12] that for years, I wouldn't preach on it
[1:07:13] because I I thought I had always
[1:07:15] preached everything has to be in the
[1:07:17] atonement. So that it's really not, you
[1:07:20] know, you doing it. It's God doing it.
[1:07:22] It's all paid for you at Calvary. You
[1:07:23] didn't get saved, you know, at an altar.
[1:07:25] You found out that work was done 1900
[1:07:27] years ago. You weren't healed yesterday.
[1:07:30] You found out that work WAS DONE 1900
[1:07:32] YEARS AGO THAT DAY ON CALVARY. SO HE
[1:07:34] SAID EVERYTHING HAS TO BE IN THE
[1:07:36] ATONEMENT. AND I CAN'T IMAGINE NOW THIS
[1:07:38] IS HE'S NOT SAYING you know this is
[1:07:41] SOMETHING IN THE ATONEMENT HE'S SAYING
[1:07:42] IF YOU SAY NOW IT'S NOW IT'S PUTTING IT
[1:07:44] BACK ON THE PERSON.
[1:07:45] AMEN.
[1:07:46] And brother Brandon WAS LIKE WOW HOW
[1:07:48] DOES THAT EVEN WORK? I DON'T EVEN KNOW.
[1:07:50] I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THAT. I GUESS
[1:07:52] MAYBE BECAUSE WHEN HE SAID IT THE
[1:07:54] ATONEMENT HADN'T COME. JESUS HADN'T
[1:07:55] DIED. MAYBE THAT'S IT. THAT'S WHAT I'LL
[1:07:57] SAY IF SOMEBODY ASKS ME. And he's
[1:07:59] troubled over that for a number of
[1:08:01] years. He won't even preach on it
[1:08:02] because he don't know the answer.
[1:08:06] AND GOD BEGINS TO DEAL with him, starts
[1:08:08] dealing with his life, starts bringing
[1:08:10] these things of the third pole and
[1:08:12] particularly, you know, this this whole
[1:08:14] deal with the squirrels and speaking
[1:08:16] them into existence and Hadiites
[1:08:19] children and and you know, the the fish
[1:08:21] and there there there's those Jehovah's
[1:08:23] Witness coming to the Lord because
[1:08:25] they're seeing it and he he's dealing
[1:08:27] with all of these things and speaking a
[1:08:29] tumor and speaking to a STORM AND IT'S
[1:08:32] GOD, WHAT'S GOD DOING? TRAINING HIM.
[1:08:35] SAY, "WELL, BUT HE WENT OFF THE SCENE,
[1:08:38] SO HE MUST BE GOING TO COME BACK TO USE
[1:08:41] UP ALL THAT TRAINING." MM- NO, HE
[1:08:44] DOESN'T NEED TO COME BACK. HE FINISHED
[1:08:46] HIS JOB.
[1:08:47] IT'S A ROAD MAP FOR YOU.
[1:08:50] IT'S AN INSTRUCTION MANUAL FOR YOU AND
[1:08:53] ME. WE'RE THE ONES WHO ARE SEEING THE
[1:08:55] WORLD GO OFF A CLIFF.
[1:08:57] WE'RE THE ONES WHO HAVE THE WHO HAVE
[1:08:59] THAT POWER. YOU HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY.
[1:09:01] GOD WON'T FORCE IT ON YOU, BUT YOU HAVE
[1:09:03] THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE SPOKEN WORD
[1:09:05] OPERATING IN YOUR LIFE WHERE NOTHING CAN
[1:09:07] STAND BEFORE YOU. BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE
[1:09:10] REVIVAL AND THAT'S GOING TO TAKE
[1:09:11] REPENTANCE. IT'S GOING TO TAKE SINCERITY
[1:09:14] AND HUMILITY
[1:09:16] AND NOT CHOOSING THE WORLD AND TURNING
[1:09:18] YOUR EYES UPON JESUS AND STOP LOOKING AT
[1:09:21] THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. AMEN.
[1:09:26] SEE, so don't forget you sit here today.
[1:09:32] And this isn't in my notes, but it comes
[1:09:36] to me strong.
[1:09:37] You s you might be here today
[1:09:41] and I'm thinking of no certain person.
[1:09:43] Trust me, this is just fresh.
[1:09:46] And you
[1:09:48] you might not feel the urgency
[1:09:52] to kick yourself into gear and follow
[1:09:56] you. You're thinking of you still got
[1:09:58] your eyes on too much of this world. And
[1:10:01] you say, "I I agree, Brother Jason. I
[1:10:03] believe that, but I just don't seem to
[1:10:06] have the gumption. I don't really
[1:10:07] exactly want to do that right now, and
[1:10:09] I'm just comfortable where I'm at." I'm
[1:10:11] just going to say to you, you're not at
[1:10:14] the Red Sea with an army behind you
[1:10:16] about to be killed yet.
[1:10:19] But take my word for it. You will end up
[1:10:23] at the Red Sea
[1:10:25] because that's where Moses had to stop
[1:10:27] crying and he had to speak the word. And
[1:10:30] when you're sitting there and you're
[1:10:32] trapped in the mountains and you've got
[1:10:33] an ocean in front of you and an army
[1:10:35] trying to murder you, you'll remember.
[1:10:38] And I'm going to tell you, that'll bring
[1:10:40] some desperation. THAT'LL BRING SOME
[1:10:42] REAL FAST HUMILITY. I WOULD IMPLORE YOU
[1:10:45] TODAY, DON'T WAIT UNTIL THAT HAPPENS.
[1:10:50] TODAY IS THE DAY OF SALVATION.
[1:10:55] SO, SO WE FIND HIM COMING HERE. OH, I
[1:10:58] GOT TO HURRY. I think I know where I'm
[1:11:00] going to get to today. So, we're just
[1:11:01] going to aim at that and we'll pull the
[1:11:04] parachute and jump out.
[1:11:08] So, so it, SO PERFECT FAITH, BECAUSE
[1:11:11] THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT YOU'RE GOING
[1:11:12] TO SEE HERE IN A MINUTE. IT'S THE mind
[1:11:14] of Christ. It it's the mind of Christ
[1:11:16] operating in you. It's not your mind.
[1:11:19] So, SO THE SQUIRRELS AND THE FISH, TH
[1:11:23] THOSE WERE EXAMPLES OF THINGS TO WORK
[1:11:25] THROUGH THE BRIDE. I SAID THIS TO YOU
[1:11:26] LAST TIME, AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
[1:11:28] POINT. CREATING ANIMALS BY THE SPOKEN
[1:11:31] WORD
[1:11:33] AND RESURRECTING MARINE LIFE. That's not
[1:11:36] the lesson.
[1:11:39] THAT'S NOT THE LESSON.
[1:11:41] AMEN.
[1:11:42] YOU SEE THE THE THE THE THE COMMON
[1:11:45] THREAD IN ALL OF IT FROM ABRAHAM TO
[1:11:48] ELIJAH TO US NOW WHO ARE ALIVE AND
[1:11:52] REMAIN THE COMMON THEME OF OF THE HERE'S
[1:11:56] THE LESSON A DEDICATED LIFE.
[1:11:59] THAT'S WHAT ALLOWED THAT TO HAPPEN. SO,
[1:12:02] IT'S NOT LIMITED TO A AN AQUATIC ANIMAL
[1:12:06] UH BEING GIVEN HIS LIFE BACK. IT'S NOT
[1:12:08] LIMITED TO YOU BEING A SUPER, YOU KNOW,
[1:12:10] A STORMCHASER. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ABOUT
[1:12:13] THAT.
[1:12:13] IT'S ABOUT DEDICATION SO THAT WHATEVER
[1:12:16] HAPPENS IN YOUR LIFE,
[1:12:19] you are more than prepared.
[1:12:22] More than a match.
[1:12:26] SO WHEN WE LOOK AT IT THIS WAY, WE COME
[1:12:28] DOWN AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY I was I WAS
[1:12:31] SAYING TO YOU HOW THAT YOU KNOW EVEN
[1:12:33] brother he was dealing with and the Lord
[1:12:36] was teaching him all this stuff. Some of
[1:12:38] it just didn't make sense to me.
[1:12:40] REMEMBER WE DEALT with um we dealt with
[1:12:44] the the mother praying over her son
[1:12:46] there the ground
[1:12:49] was walking and he leaves his room to go
[1:12:53] down SOME LETTERS AND THE SAYS, "START
[1:12:56] WALKING." REMEMBER THAT?
[1:12:58] AND HERE'S WHAT HERE WAS A POINT THAT I
[1:13:01] KEPT MAKING YOU
[1:13:03] EXPLAIN TO HIM.
[1:13:06] HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW GOD HAD
[1:13:10] PILOTS IN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL.
[1:13:16] And supposed to
[1:13:18] misses that flight, it's going to be A
[1:13:19] PROBLEM. AND GOD JUST SAYS, "Keep
[1:13:21] walking." He's walking away from his
[1:13:23] obligation to catch
[1:13:25] and he's giving him no
[1:13:30] situations in
[1:13:33] HE WAS TESTING AN ACTION TO A REACTION.
[1:13:37] AMEN.
[1:13:37] That's what happen.
[1:13:49] AND SO HE'S TRAINING HIM TO JUST TRUST.
[1:13:52] I don't have to explain everything. Just
[1:13:55] learn to obey what I tell you.
[1:13:58] And so, YOU KNOW, HE COMES DOWN THERE.
[1:14:00] WE TALKED ABOUT THAT LAST TIME. HE COME
[1:14:02] DOWN and she says
[1:14:06] and she says, "But
[1:14:09] I didn't stop."
[1:14:15] So, you know, you know, you know what I
[1:14:18] really love about those stories and the
[1:14:19] reason that I told We rehearse the story
[1:14:24] and mother
[1:14:30] and she's praying.
[1:14:32] I'm thinking to myself, well, I guess I
[1:14:34] missed my
[1:14:36] whole thing
[1:14:42] to get you to understand this is just
[1:14:45] real life.
[1:14:47] So stop LOOKING FOR SOME PIE IN THE SKY.
[1:14:50] THIS IS REAL LIFE IN REAL TIME by real
[1:14:53] people.
[1:14:55] And so we're not LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
[1:14:58] WITHOUT FIREWORKS AND EVERYTHING. IT'S
[1:15:00] HERE
[1:15:02] THAT THE WORLD'S GOING TO CHASE THAT
[1:15:03] INTO
[1:15:06] THE BIBLE TELLS THEM THAT THEY WILL
[1:15:07] THEY'LL MARVEL AT THE BEAST WHO CAN MAKE
[1:15:09] FIRE OUT OF THE
[1:15:12] AND THAT'S TECHNOLOGY THAT STARTED WITH
[1:15:15] THE ATOMIC DESTRUCTION OVER OVER
[1:15:17] HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI.
[1:15:20] BECAUSE it's it's revelation 13 AND FROM
[1:15:22] THERE IT JUST IT JUST GOES ON AND ON AND
[1:15:24] ON ON THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE HAS BEEN
[1:15:25] GIVEN US ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER ONE
[1:15:27] thing after another and THE WHOLE WORLD
[1:15:28] IS MESMERIZED
[1:15:31] OH BUT THERE'S A SIMPLE HUMBLE PEOPLE
[1:15:33] WHO ARE JUST MARCHING TO THE STEP OF THE
[1:15:35] GOSPEL who living every day as believers
[1:15:38] and humble lives and I'M HERE TO TELL
[1:15:40] YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ON CHASING IT'S
[1:15:42] HAPPENING AROUND YOU THE WORLD IS
[1:15:44] COLLAPSING AROUND YOU AND THE PRESENCE
[1:15:46] OF GOD IS AROUND YOU AND THE WORD IS
[1:15:47] HERE AROUND YOU AND TO GO FORWARD.
[1:15:52] HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:55] HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. HE WANTED TO
[1:15:57] UNDERSTAND IT ALL, YOU KNOW, UNAWARE
[1:15:59] EVEN AS THE PROPHET OF THE AGE THAT HE
[1:16:02] HE WAS UNAWARE
[1:16:04] THAT HE'S ACTUALLY WALKING IN A VISION.
[1:16:11] I mean, IF YOU
[1:16:14] WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET INTO Kentucky
[1:16:15] Woods today.
[1:16:19] Let's go to Let's go to
[1:16:23] he
[1:16:38] told the doctor's
[1:16:42] next
[1:16:49] healthy woman.
[1:16:53] And so,
[1:16:56] YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW HOW I MEAN, YOU KNOW
[1:16:58] THE STORY. He's going to pray and pray
[1:17:00] and pray. It's going to get worse and
[1:17:01] worse and worse. He's going to pray and
[1:17:03] pray and pray. It's going to get worse
[1:17:04] and worse and worse UNTIL FINALLY SHE'S
[1:17:07] GOING TO THE DOCTOR. HE'S NOT EVEN HOME.
[1:17:10] YEAH.
[1:17:11] AND HE HE'S DOWN ON HIS KNEES IN A
[1:17:13] LITTLE APARTMENT AND HE'S SAYING, "LORD,
[1:17:16] AND REASONING WITH GOD. I love prophets
[1:17:18] do that. Don't ever hesitate to talk to
[1:17:20] God like a friend.
[1:17:22] You don't got to have all these and
[1:17:25] that's fine. I do the same thing.
[1:17:27] Sometimes I'm feeling particularly pious
[1:17:29] in prayer. But sometimes I just say
[1:17:36] come down AND SIT DOWN HERE AND I'LL SIP
[1:17:38] ON MY COFFEE AND YOU'LL HAVE A
[1:17:40] DISCUSSION BURDEN ON my heart.
[1:17:43] I NEED I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT IT.
[1:17:47] OH FRIENDS, LET ME TESTIFY TO YOU. HE'S
[1:17:51] SO FAITHFUL TO COME.
[1:17:53] YOU INVITE HIM. JESUS ALWAYS COMES WHEN
[1:17:56] HE'S IN.
[1:17:57] He always keeps his appointment. YOU
[1:18:00] WANT TO KNOW HIM? TELL HIM. I WANT TO
[1:18:02] KNOW YOU MORE.
[1:18:04] I WANT TO HAVE A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP. HE
[1:18:06] WANTS TO HEAR THAT.
[1:18:10] He's real. HE'S PERSONAL. HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:15] He cares.
[1:18:19] Oh, brother takes that whole sermon. He
[1:18:22] cares. You care. Does he care?
[1:18:25] Does he care?
[1:18:28] BIBLE STORY.
[1:18:30] DOES HE CARE? LOOK AT WHAT HE DID FOR
[1:18:32] THIS ONE. DOES HE CARE? HE TALKS ABOUT A
[1:18:34] YOUNG BOY COMING IN, COMING TO CHURCH,
[1:18:36] GAVE HIS HEART TO THE LORD, WENT AWAY.
[1:18:38] THE DEVIL ATTACKS HIS MIND. HE'S LOSING
[1:18:39] HIS MIND. AND BROTHERS TO TO HIM AND THE
[1:18:43] DEVIL AND SAID, "SEE, IN A MINUTE, HE
[1:18:45] WAS IN HIS RIGHT MIND AGAIN." SAID,
[1:18:47] "SEE, JESUS CARED ABOUT THAT YOUNG MAN."
[1:18:50] I'm here TO TELL YOU, YOUNG MAN, HE
[1:18:51] CARES ABOUT YOU. YOUNG WOMEN, YOUNG
[1:18:54] SISTERS, HE CARES.
[1:18:56] OH, THAT I MAY KNOW HIM, THE POWER OF
[1:18:59] HIS RESURRECTION.
[1:19:01] HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:03] This is THIS IS THE RESULT OF LETTING
[1:19:07] you in Christ. I mean, THAT'S WHAT
[1:19:09] THAT'S WHERE THAT GOES.
[1:19:11] WAS SAYING THAT I MAY KNOW HIM IN THE
[1:19:13] POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION. HE'S GOING TO
[1:19:15] TIE IT RIGHT TO YOU GOT TO ALLOW THE
[1:19:18] MIND OF CHRIST THAT WHAT THAT MIND THAT
[1:19:20] WAS IN HIM LET IT BE IN you
[1:19:23] so that you CAN KNOW HIM NOT ONLY JUST
[1:19:26] KNOW ABOUT him
[1:19:28] you can even know him in the fellowship
[1:19:29] of his sufferings being made for
[1:19:34] and so he he's pleading laying out his
[1:19:38] case
[1:19:41] and I look how many times I've come in
[1:19:44] I've been gone
[1:19:46] and she just gives me a kiss and hands
[1:19:48] me my wife for days and she's never
[1:19:52] complained always there. She's between
[1:19:54] me and the public maturely. She's been
[1:19:58] loyal. She's been faithful. took care of
[1:20:01] me and he's POURING HIS HEART OUT.
[1:20:05] And now by train
[1:20:16] in the woods that's what
[1:20:18] he understands
[1:20:29] and he says he scripture
[1:20:33] bringing that to me. You know, I DON'T
[1:20:36] KNOW WHAT THAT IS. WHY DO YOU KEEP I
[1:20:38] CAN'T UNDERSTAND. HE'S HAVING A
[1:20:40] CONVERSATION. THERE'S A BEING STANDING
[1:20:41] THERE. HE CAN'T SEE LOOKING AROUND
[1:20:43] TALKING. He said, "Where's that light? I
[1:20:45] see that." HE FINALLY GETS SO BESIDE
[1:20:48] HIMSELF THAT THE STRESS AND THE PRESSURE
[1:20:50] OF THESE SQUIRRELS IS SO GREAT. HE'S
[1:20:52] SAYING, "WHERE ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT
[1:20:55] WITH ME?
[1:20:57] WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING? AM I CRAZY?
[1:21:02] He said, "YOU KNOW, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
[1:21:04] THAT SCRIPTURE." HE SAID, "HOW HOW IS IT
[1:21:07] THAT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? HOW IS IT
[1:21:09] THAT IT'S ON A MAN TO do it? I'VE ALWAYS
[1:21:13] PREACHED EVERYTHING HAD TO BE THE
[1:21:14] ATONEMENT." And
[1:21:20] when you're on the platform
[1:21:22] and you're discerning people's lives, is
[1:21:25] that you doing that?
[1:21:32] He goes, "When you're speaking
[1:21:39] or is that me doing that for you?"
[1:21:42] And then he goes, "Oh, isn't it funny?
[1:21:45] in a moment and he starts saying, "Lord,
[1:21:48] oh, you're right now. I get it. It's not
[1:21:50] about ME DECIDING. IT'S GOD WORKING
[1:21:53] THROUGH A SURRENDERED VESSEL. SAY WHAT
[1:21:57] YOU WILL." WHAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS IS
[1:22:00] YOU'RE YOU'RE ONLY UNDER THE CONTROL OF
[1:22:02] THE HOLY SPIRIT. YOUR WILL IS HIS WILL.
[1:22:04] HIS WILL IS YOUR WILL. HIS MIND IS YOUR
[1:22:07] MIND.
[1:22:09] BECAUSE WHY? YOU MADE A CHOICE TO LIVE
[1:22:11] THAT DREAM.
[1:22:13] AMEN.
[1:22:14] You made a choice
[1:22:16] to turn your eyes away from Jesus.
[1:22:19] Turn your eyes away from the world
[1:22:20] towards
[1:22:24] it. He says, "All right."
[1:22:33] Stand up.
[1:22:37] Say what it'll be. He said I say I say
[1:22:42] that before she's going to the doctor
[1:22:46] and she can't hardly even walk and the
[1:22:50] surgeon's hand touches her.
[1:22:55] She got it
[1:22:58] down the road
[1:23:03] with it.
[1:23:05] had to get help getting up on the table
[1:23:07] with it. Laid down with it. The doctor
[1:23:10] walked in. SHE STILL GOT IT. HE WALKED
[1:23:12] THREE or four FEET TO HER. MRS. BRANDON,
[1:23:15] HOW ARE YOU TODAY? SHE STILL GOT IT. ALL
[1:23:17] RIGHT, LET'S SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT. AND NOW
[1:23:19] HIS HANDS ARE GOING. SHE STILL GOT IT
[1:23:21] UNTIL HIS HANDS COME DOWN AND SHE don't
[1:23:32] anymore.
[1:23:34] HALLELUJAH. HAS THE POWER THAT THAT GOD
[1:23:36] HAS RESERVED FOR YOUR LIFE AND FOR MY
[1:23:39] LIFE. AND YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT. YOUR
[1:23:41] KIDS ARE GOING TO NEED IT.
[1:23:43] I IMPLORE YOU TODAY. LET THIS MIND WHICH
[1:23:46] WAS IN CHRIST
[1:23:48] you
[1:23:52] think. LOOK AT THE BACKSTORY ON THAT.
[1:23:56] THAT WHOLE EPISODE STARTED MONTHS AHEAD
[1:23:59] OF THAT
[1:24:00] WHERE BROTHER BRANDON WAS GONE ALL THE
[1:24:02] TIME. HE GO TWO OR THREE MONTHS AT A
[1:24:04] TIME AND AND BECAUSE HE YOU KNOW HE COME
[1:24:06] IN AND JOSEPH NEEDED A HIDING AND HE A
[1:24:09] LITTLE WHIPPED AND HE COULDN'T DO IT
[1:24:10] BECAUSE HE he hadn't seen him in two or
[1:24:13] three months and his said honey
[1:24:16] you know he's just a little boy and she
[1:24:18] said you know she had ENOUGH
[1:24:25] place and and and SHE SAYS AND YOU KNOW
[1:24:28] WHAT SHE DOES a she's never done
[1:24:33] She raised her voice and says, "WELL, IF
[1:24:35] YOU HAD TO LIVE WITH HIM ALL THE TIME,
[1:24:36] YOU wouldn't
[1:24:41] look at the backtory." YOU KNOW WHAT
[1:24:43] THAT WAS?
[1:24:58] a prophet
[1:25:01] who was prayed up. Brothers, you ready?
[1:25:06] Ready, brothers?
[1:25:09] prophet who was prayed up who had his
[1:25:11] wife raise her voice and slam the door
[1:25:14] in his face
[1:25:19] man
[1:25:30] up said
[1:25:47] up to a moment when a doctor's hand
[1:26:07] Do my heart touch my anointed. Go tell
[1:26:12] and you know with the mind of Christ.
[1:26:14] Now, here's an angel GAVE HIM A DIRECT
[1:26:17] ORDER. DON'T TELL HER ANYTHING LIKE
[1:26:19] THAT. BUT A prophet with the mind of
[1:26:21] Christ said he decided, "Well, I'm not."
[1:26:39] Listen friends, the mind of Christ,
[1:26:43] the third
[1:26:45] has a lot more to do with your everyday
[1:26:49] life
[1:26:50] than it does moments
[1:26:58] into
[1:27:07] [Music]
[1:27:10] the sons of God.
[1:27:14] And it's all working
[1:27:22] I feel in my heart that I would like to
[1:27:24] say while I still have you here is that
[1:27:28] you know
[1:27:36] you know let's just say that God worked
[1:27:38] it out perfectly
[1:27:40] say it that way I don't want to put that
[1:27:42] on the mind of
[1:27:43] Let's just say that and that's A BETTER
[1:27:46] WAY BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU MIGHT NOT ACT
[1:27:48] PERFECTLY BUT GOD WILL STILL WORK IT
[1:27:50] around perfectly.
[1:27:51] Amen.
[1:27:53] So I don't want any slamming doors and
[1:27:55] saying
[1:28:05] all he needs, all he's ever
[1:28:16] leave this one up, guys. See, so we had
[1:28:19] a mic still running.
[1:28:21] Let's bow our heads.
[1:28:26] Lord, here I stand. And
[1:28:29] I still didn't get to that that I wanted
[1:28:31] to so bad. I've been trying so hard. But
[1:28:34] at the same time, I felt governor on me
[1:28:39] to say what we did say. And I I think
[1:28:42] that we have accomplished enough. I
[1:28:44] certainly stand here and feel completely
[1:28:46] satisfied that you are satisfied with
[1:28:49] everything that was said.
[1:28:52] And I'm asking right now, Lord God, that
[1:28:54] the people under the sound of my voice
[1:28:55] who heard this sermon, who or who will
[1:28:57] hear it,
[1:28:59] that they will take these words to heart
[1:29:01] and ponder them deeply,
[1:29:03] that they will realize that God is
[1:29:05] wanting to walk around in their shoes.
[1:29:10] God is wanting to strap that apron on,
[1:29:13] sister, in you.
[1:29:15] God is wanting to grab that toolbox,
[1:29:17] brother, in you.
[1:29:20] God, teenagers, God is wanting to ride
[1:29:24] with you in your car in you.
[1:29:27] God is wanting to live everyday life in
[1:29:30] our life. We are his church. He goes to
[1:29:33] church every day
[1:29:36] because we are the temple of the Lord.
[1:29:40] We are the we are the living tabernacle
[1:29:44] of the living God's dwelling place.
[1:29:48] Father, I pray today that we will take
[1:29:50] these things to heart and be mindful of
[1:29:52] them in days to come. We still have much
[1:29:54] more to say, but Lord, I I I have
[1:29:56] endeavored and I feel so happy because I
[1:29:59] I feel successful
[1:30:02] in demonstrating to the people just by
[1:30:06] telling these just by reliving and
[1:30:08] reminiscing these stories of of Abraham
[1:30:11] and these stories of Moses and these
[1:30:14] stories. Lord, we we opened OUR TEXT
[1:30:16] WITH A STORY.
[1:30:18] WE OPENED OUR OUR WHOLE TEXT WAS YOU
[1:30:20] TALKING TO YOUR DISCIPLES AND THEY
[1:30:22] STEPPED INTO A VISION. DIDN'T EVEN KNOW.
[1:30:24] HERE'S A HERE'S A CULT TIED CULT HAS NO
[1:30:26] IDEA. HE'S PART of a vision. He's part
[1:30:28] of thus sayeth the Lord. Here's people
[1:30:30] going to stand around. The Lord already
[1:30:32] knows what they're going to say and
[1:30:33] already knows the answer to give them
[1:30:35] and it's going to work.
[1:30:38] You provided everything that the
[1:30:40] disciples would need to fulfill your
[1:30:41] word. You do that every day in the lives
[1:30:45] of the of the disciples, in the lives of
[1:30:48] Lord of of of your prophet of this day,
[1:30:50] walking around in normal life, learning
[1:30:52] how to surrender to you.
[1:30:57] And that's the real lesson of it, Lord
[1:30:59] God. You are calling for greater
[1:31:02] sincerity.
[1:31:03] We are at the crossing over point. We
[1:31:06] are at the end of the end and heaven is
[1:31:09] before us.
[1:31:12] And your word has a mission to
[1:31:14] accomplish and you desire to accomplish
[1:31:16] it within us. But that it's NOT ABOUT
[1:31:19] IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A QUESTION. Lord I I
[1:31:21] have certainly been born again of the
[1:31:23] spirit of God. I certainly have received
[1:31:27] a revelation of Jesus Christ personally.
[1:31:30] You gave it to me personally.
[1:31:33] I was born again in the glorious baptism
[1:31:35] of the Holy Spirit. But now, Father,
[1:31:38] it's up to me to to allow you complete
[1:31:42] unfettered access to every facet of my
[1:31:45] humanity,
[1:31:46] everything that I can muster, which I
[1:31:48] can't muster a whole lot. That's why it
[1:31:50] takes prayer and a lot of it. IT TAKES
[1:31:53] OPENING UP MY BIBLE AND A LOT a lot of
[1:31:56] it. It takes pushing play and often. IT
[1:31:59] TAKES COMING TO CHURCH ALWAYS. IT TAKES
[1:32:02] THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE SAINTS
[1:32:03] CONTINUALLY.
[1:32:06] It takes daily dying.
[1:32:09] It takes self- crucifixion.
[1:32:12] IT IT REQUIRES TURNING LIKE MOSES,
[1:32:15] REFUSING to look at the world, but
[1:32:18] rather cast his eyes on the promise of
[1:32:20] God and took the way with a much
[1:32:23] despised people.
[1:32:26] So I I feel that that's been
[1:32:29] accomplished in these four parts and we
[1:32:32] we want to continue. Lord, there's much
[1:32:35] more material to talk about and things I
[1:32:38] want to speak to the people about. This
[1:32:39] series, Father, has been probably more
[1:32:42] of a heartfelt series than I've had in a
[1:32:44] long time because it's I guess maybe
[1:32:46] because it's so personal to me because I
[1:32:49] see myself. I'm right there. I'm living
[1:32:53] regular life in real time and I'm trying
[1:32:56] to serve you every hour and I'm I'm I'm
[1:32:59] I'm consumed with coming closer to you.
[1:33:02] I'm whatever it takes, Lord. Whatever I
[1:33:05] got to surrender, whatever I got to
[1:33:07] change, whatever I got to give up, I'm
[1:33:09] asking for the the wherewithal to do
[1:33:12] that, Lord. Help me now. HELP US ONE AND
[1:33:15] ALL to that we might press forward into
[1:33:18] these things. Please remember that we're
[1:33:21] but dust. That's all we are. We're dust
[1:33:24] and we need you, Jesus.
[1:33:26] So, I commit it into your hands today.
[1:33:29] The word has gone forth now in Jesus
[1:33:32] name. Let's sing. Brother Anthony
[1:33:35] [Music]
[1:33:42] upon Jesus

[1:35:28] way.

[1:35:35] [Music]
[1:35:36] of earth
