you turned there daniel chapter 12. send a powerpoint to the email brothers you can just have that ready let's look at daniel chapter 12. that's actually our sunday school title this morning this is just daniel 12 and um we're going to take this over the next few sunday schools let's begin here today verse 1 at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life some to shame and everlasting contempt and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteous the stars forever and ever but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased then i daniel looked and behold there stood other two the one on this side of the bank of the river and the other on that side of the bank of the river and one said to the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders and i heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river which he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and swore by him that liveth forever that it shall be for a time times and a half and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished and i heard but i understood not then said i o my lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end let's keep reading many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the abomination that maketh desolate set up there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days blessed is he that wadeth and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days but go thy way till the end be for thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot at the end of days you can be seated you could just have that power point for me if you could i just want to read from it and brother brad i'm speaking here in the beginning and ending of the gentile dispensation and listen to what he says right here he says now at this time at that time the 12th chapter and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince that standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such was never since there was a nation even to that time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book oh my listen to what brother branham says here aren't you glad your name is on his book daniel over here saw him come to the ancient of days whose hair was as white as wool and he opened up the books and they were judged every man out of the books the great white throne judgment now daniel is given the assurance that at the end of the gentile dispensation when you go home tomorrow read the 11th chapter i want to pause right there underline this when i read this i want you as your homework to this class to go read the book of daniel and specifically chapter 11 on all the way through the end of the book of daniel we're going to be covering a lot of it here let's just pick up brother branham says you can see how the king of the north is coming down which is nothing else but russia coming down to press against it like a whirlwind now brother branham uses that word like a whirlwind because if you read daniel chapter 11 that's exactly what he's referred to as the king of the north will come like a whirlwind and the great battle of armageddon will be fought right there near the gates of jerusalem there's been a lot of interest in people questioning and asking about russia and ukraine and the war that's happening right now and immediately when things like this happen our mind as believers go straight to the prophet and what did what did brother adam say about this and so there's a lot that he did say and i think there could be a sometimes a lot of misunderstanding and a lot of confusion well didn't brother branham you hear this statement a lot well didn't brother branham say something about that over here and you know it's funny you never really chase those things down and find out what did he say so you just sort of stay in wonderment and wonder what exactly did he say well i'd encourage you go back and find out what he said because there's some very specific things that brother branham said about and you were not we you're you there's nothing that the lord desires greater than to give you clarity where there's confusion on any matter whatever it is the lord wants to because we have an answer and i'm so glad that we do we have an answer specific answer and so i don't want to really get bogged down in that uh this morning but i just want to say that uh the there is a context in which you talk about russia there is a context in which you type in which you correlate that with the king of the north in the book of daniel but there's no scripture that speaks of ukraine and russia going to war now there's a lot of things you see in in highlights and maybe setting the stage for certain things um even someone forwarded uh someone's forwarded that i didn't know if i could uh i don't think i had it written in my notes but someone had forwarded a video yep someone had forwarded a video of of biden um in poland as he just went there u.s president uh there went to poland and if you watch his speech he begins his speech uh with the words be not afraid and he's quoting from pope john paul now here's a u.s president quoting from a pope i i'll share you the um the first pope of poland i should say in 1978 and i could i could forge that video if you want to see it it's pretty incredible an american president using the words quoting the words of a pope in poland and you look at the beast power that's raising up and really what as we heard over the last uh maybe two sundays ago what putin is finding out is that you can't make war with the beast that's what the bible says who could make war with him and so a lot of these things you don't you you want to go home and actually read and and and so i encourage you to go back and read the book of daniel from 11 on and you're going to find out why i picked that chapter and on here in a minute notice let's follow along here he says coming down to let's go back back to the slide there coming down to press against it like a whirlwind and the great battle of armageddon will be fought right there near the gates of jerusalem notice oh i love this and at that time they thy people shall be delivered every one that's been found written in the book the lamb's book of life michael the great prince shall stand up for what for thy people and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake win when these times take place some to everlasting life some to shame and everlasting contempt and he ends with verse 40 and at that time of the end shall the king of the south push at him and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind with chariots with horsemen and with many ships and he shall enter into the countries and shall pass over so you this amazing book of daniel is filled with stories that you know very familiar daniel in the lion's den it has shadrach meshach and abednego belshazzar's feast and and all of these stories that uh you know you hear the the writing the handwriting on the wall many men will take many many take a you farce and all of the stories that you hear from sunday school but then you move after chapter 10 and you have all the stories of the life of daniel daniel from captivity because the book of of daniel covers about 75 years of daniel's life about 75 years of it what's incredible is though it covers 75 years of daniel's life it actually covers thousands of years of human history because there's two types of history did you know that there's two types of history there's that which is past that's already taken place and then there's that which is future you say brother matt future history yep it's called prophecy because prophecy is future history in other words in the mind of god it's already taken place and there's a prophet who's already seen it and has already spoken of it and it's historic in the mind of god do you realize that friends that everything that's going to happen in your lifetime and in after your lifetime if there's an after your lifetime has already taken place in the mind of god it's all just a drama taking place and it's all of uh it's up to us to find our place in that drama and so he covers he covers 75 years of daniel's life because the but what you have it all the way from chapter 1 to chapter 10 is is daniel's life and daniel coming through and you have all the stories of daniel but then in chapter 11 it changes to prophecy and that's why when you read here in daniel 12 and we're reading the 11 and you're hearing things about the end time you're hearing about armageddon you're hearing about the king of the north and the great white throne judgment and those that raised to shame and those that raised to life what you find is is that daniel's saying i don't understand i don't have understanding then god says seal it up daniel for it's not not it's not at this time you're going to lay in peace you'll lay in your lot you're going to die you want to see it but it's not for you right now but god was going to speak through this prophet and he was going to prophesy about things that have happened since daniel has went off the scene and since you've been born it's pretty incredible really when you think about it how relevant it is to your life so as we said god can tell uh the future as god looks at the future as history that's why the bible says the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world and so daniel sees into this future he sees way beyond his life he doesn't understand how far beyond his life this is going to happen but he he sees it he has no idea he sees it past his life he actually sees past your life and he sees all the way over into the end of all things the climax the finality of everything the finality of all time and so i just want to skip through some of these notes to make sure we cover um so what you'll find is is that in daniel chapter 11 especially with chapter 11 we read chapter 12. but you're going to have vivid vivid specific i love god the way that god writes this in the book of daniel the way he writes prophecy is so specific it's not generic there's no there's no room for miscalculation of dates there's no room for well he could've and and it's so funny to me i was watching a um a pentecostal uh word of prophecy so i posted up on facebook somehow a feed of of a man who was uh uh pro something something something prophetic ministries and he's in a church and he's discerning uh the people and he's got it on his own facebook and his own feed and he's he's in this church and he's saying you there you're he says you there in the back right there sir what's your name sir and the man gives him his name and he says what's the woman beside you and then he starts going over these uh uh you've been through some trouble and some hard times and and and i'm thinking haven't we all been through some trouble in some hard times and then he asks them their name and and and who what's your name and and where and where are you from and you're not now it's amazing because in my mind i'm contrasting this to a real true gift of a prophet who doesn't ask anyone their name he tells them their name doesn't ask them where they're from he tells them what street they're on what address they're on gives them an address two addresses gives them one address and a sister comes back to the woman afterwards says sister you don't live there she says you you've she he she says well sister she says i've moved from that address that was that was you remember the story that the brother branham tells of the woman and she says i had moved from there yesterday from that she says you don't live there brother branham gives her the address of her new home and the sister didn't even know she had moved he says actually move that is my address and it's amazing because god doesn't do anything generic it's very specific unquestionable and so daniel is vivid detailed prophecy about 200 over over roundabout depending on what how you how you uh categorize it there's about 200 specific details in the book of daniel chapter 11 all everything of those 200 specific details don't happen in daniel's lifetime they happen centuries later and they happen exactly as daniel said they would happen you say brother matt what does that mean it means that it wasn't a book written by man it was inspired of god beforehand right for i am god and there is none other i am god he says in isaiah there's none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things that are not yet done so it's amazing because you you go through some of these and i just want to cover some facts of these because you could almost and i know we've taught on this before but i'm teaching specifically on chapter 11 and chapter 12 daniel could be cut into two halves so the first half of daniel daniel 1 through 10 is all about miracles and things that took place in daniel's lifetime and then chapter 11 on uh is all a book about prophecy and so the first six chapters uh you you you understand all from sunday's school the life of daniel the lion's den the shadrach meshech and the bendigo daniel being caught up in the court of darius and all of those things that you can read about but then you go from chapter six and then chapter seven all the way to chapter 12 um are things that maybe you probably haven't heard of before you haven't read because you don't read those parts of the bible you read the good stories about the lion's den and the shadrach meshach and abednego then you get to those parts and it's like whoa wait what's he talking about hold on a minute let me just stop you and say when you get to that moment pull out your table app and i've done this to the men's breakfast go to the exact search and search some of those things that you're reading you'll be amazed at how much is there that brother branham gave understanding on those things that you don't understand i believe we should have a desire to understand those things right and so he says in se i just want to make sure i cover uh the portion here i want to get to um yes first half one through six second half set i want to make sure i had that right seven through and so what's incredible about this book is the first half of daniel this is amazing the first chapter i should say because you have the first half the book of daniel we did this last time we talked on this and i took the book of daniel and held it in two halves the first half of daniel chapter one through chapter six and then the second half chapter seven through chapter twelve as something pretty incredible the first half the first chapter sorry of the first half is written in hebrew the language of hebrew but the next five chapters are written in aramaic you follow that yeah so the first chapter in daniel is written in hebrew the next five two three four five are written in aramaic now aramaic is the official language of that time it was the common language it was used everywhere in the ancient world the first chapter of the second half right so after chapter five of the second half is written in aramaic the next chap but the next five chapters are written in hebrew again it's amazing they've changed the language the language is written originally in hebrew and in aramaic and so it tells you what you say why is that significant it tells you where the book was supposed to be read who it was intended you write something and the writer has an audience in mind he has someone he's going he's planning on reading this portion of the book so it tells you where the chapters were meant to be read and who those chapters were directed towards so you can tell which parts were meant to be read widely amongst everybody and anybody can read it and anybody could understand it but then there were certain parts of daniel that were written in a different language so that only hebrews could understand and could read i hope you followed that some of daniel is written for everybody to read and understand then there's certain parts only you understand there's certain parts of the bible that are written for the whole world to understand in fact the whole bible at a certain level but i want you to understand that to his bride there are certain parts that is meant for you to understand and everybody else may read it and go ah don't really see anything there but to you it means everything and so so don't don't criticize someone who can't see what you see because maybe they don't understand that language because they weren't meant to understand that language you say brother matt this is very similar what jesus said when he said jesus lord master why do you speak in parables very simple answer because to you it is given to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven to them it's not given blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they hear so even in daniel there are portions that were written to the common everyday language where everybody in the world could understand and then there were certain portions that were written only for god's family to be able to understand because god hides himself from the wise and the prudent and he reveals himself unto babes and i believe that if anything any attitude we could always have and keep and maintain before god is never a know-it-all i know everything i can't be taught anything but keep a teachable spirit before the lord because that's the spirit of a babe such as would learn this never brother branham said don't ever put a period put a comma there let god open himself up more to you can you say amen to that and so you go beyond this and all the way through chapter 12. what's amazing is that he's going to go he's going to go and i'm going to skip some of this details through chapter 1 through chapter 5. chapter 11 is going to include details about empires kingdoms uh it's going to talk about different developments in the political sphere and end time powers that would affect the jews and the jewish people and so the the the through chapter 10 i'm just going to read this from verse 1 of chapter 10. in the third year of cyrus the message in the third year of cyrus king of persia message was revealed to daniel whose name was called bell to chazar the message was true but the appointed time was long and he understood the message at ha and had understanding of the vision so you go through chapter one it's all about the deportation uh of of of of the jews to babylon the royal court of babylon and daniel's one of those hebrew boys that were deported off of the land into babylon and they're all given babylonian names daniel's given a babylonian name uh misha is given a babylonian azariah is given a babylonian name uh michiel those are shadrach meshach and abednego that wasn't their real names that was babylonian names that the king had given them and so daniel you go through chapter two and then you have this dream of this great giant statue of a man and nebuchadnezzar calls all of his prophets into the room and says can you tell me the meaning of this dream and he calls all the wise men to give me the interpretation and they couldn't and so now you find daniel in chapter 2 coming along to give the interpretation of this great stature and it's this great giant and as you notice all the way and i don't have the the slide that we had before but you've seen the slide of the picture and you go down all the way down this great giant stature and you'll notice the quality of materials go down all the way from gold to silver to iron and then in the feet it's mixed in with iron and clay and we know that all of those different materials represent a different empire whether it was the greeks and then it goes moves on down to the iron which was rome and then it moves into the clay mixed with iron and so that nebuchadnezzar daniel gives him the interpretation to nebuchadnezzar of this dream that this entire figure that you've had in your dream of this great stature and the different uh the different materials of this great stature daniel's interpretation was king this is speaking of empires that will outlive you much greater than you well this dream that you've had this whole entire figure is the unveiling of future empires that will replace babylon and so babylon will be replaced by the medes and the persians and then under cyrus and darius and then that happened uh but they were they were never in the great in the in the grandeur and the splendor of babylon then they would be followed by the greek empire under alexander the great and daniel speaks of the little horn and we don't have time to get into that but it's it's amazing details uh about that empire who would conquer the persians and the medes and then alexander the great went all the way uh all the way to india and he builds builds uh persopolis the capital and he has this great victory and and it conquers the conquers what you would think is the entire world and and then the greeks would replace be replaced by the romans and then that empire would rise and that empire would fall and then the the uh and then there it would be a great army that would be followed and mixed with uh clay and iron and he saws then he sees a stone that's taken from the mountain and it's god's first warning to this one king nebuchadnezzar king you might be in charge of your dominion but i'm in charge of the whole world and i'm in charge of all of history and i calls kingdoms to rise and i cause kingdoms to fall biden's not in control neither was trump in control of the nation and putin's not in control of russia people say oh man it's putin pushes that button let me tell you something let me just get you put your minds at ease no man that may be a physical man who's anointed to do something but no man has the say-so of when that button is pushed there is a man who's got his finger on the button and his name is jesus and he decides to say time shall be no more and the end of all things so your life in my life isn't in the control of kim jong-un or some tyrant over in russia my life is in control and my life has been called up into another entire sphere not of this world not part of it and so you go through all of this and what's amazing is that daniel sees all the way and you move on chapter 3 chapter 4 all the way into daniel 11 and it's incredible because daniel sees he sees the messiah prince and we know that the prophecy of daniel 70 weeks and he sees all the way to the coming of the messiah prince all the way down to the day he rides in jerusalem and daniel in the book of daniel you find the exact to the amount to the to the to the very day that jesus comes writing in and daniel sees this messiah he sees the time in a.d and then in bc all of time and daniel sees the coming of jesus and he sees what happens to the jews before that coming and he sees right before at the ending at the ending of bc before christ right before christ comes daniel sees a tyrant an evil man an evil man that is more evil to the jews than any other nation or any other leader had ever been and daniel sees destruction and you can go in historically you read about antiochus epiphanes and if you study the the maccabean revolt and the book of maccabees you'll learn all about this man antiochus epiphanes in history who who and you you have judah benjamin jude i think is his name in the book of maccabees and you have all of this history that takes place and then you have jesus and daniel sees the coming of this messiah prince down to the day down to the day that he's cut off and then it's like it's like daniel stops there he he he stops speaking about the messiah prince and he goes straight into the end the white throne judgment and the battle of armageddon and the the end time end of all end and the climax of everything he skips thousands of years of history in which you're a part of that history and he moves if you read in the book of in the in chapter 12 he moves all the way from jesus the messiah prince and then he immediately it's sort of like two binocular if you look through a pair of binoculars and you have a i'm just going to close here because we're out of time you have a mountain and you're looking at a mountain range you know if you take those binoculars and you're looking at a mountain range and you see a peak right here right you see a peak right here and you're looking this way and then there's a higher peak beyond it you know what it's going to look like to you it's going to look like all one big mountain what you can't see is that in between those two peaks is a large gap and daniel's seen the
