surrender to the K Let the worshipers [Música] le darí un aplauso al Señor esta mañana [Aplausos] él ha sido bueno con nosotros hasta el día de hoy él ha tenido cuidado de nosotros nos ha dado todo aquello de lo cual hemos necesitado tenemos muchas razones por las cuales servirle tenemos muchas razones por las cuales cantarle a Y tenemos muchas razones Así que reciban Saludos esta mañana de parte de la iglesia que estamos atendiendo tenemos una iglesia muy preciosa allá en Honduras y me encanta mucho que el hermano Luis hermano her Hero se hayan enamorado de esa iglesia porque nosotros también les amamos a ellos ellos han sido de mucha bendición para nosotros allá a través de nuestros hermanos los que mencioné antes el Señor nos ha edificado a través de la palabra hemos visto el señor restaurar vidas y yo les agradezco mucho hermano J también y agradecemos a él dar la oportunidad a estos ministros para que estén con nosotros hemos tenido un tiempo maravilloso con nuestros hermanos gracias a nuestro hermano Luis y su familia que está con nosotros que a través de ellos pues pudimos venir acá también entonces es un placer y un privilegio estar con ustedes podría decir muchas cosas acerca de Honduras pero es mejor que ustedes vayan allá [Música] que vamos a ir a la escritura Agradezco al hermano Jason la oportunidad de poder hablarles a ustedes yo sé que han tenido muy buenos predicadores acá pero yo creo que la novia también se goza con las cosas pequeñas Así que si esta mañana son cosas pequeñas le vamos a decir amén y si son cosas grandes tambén vamos al libro de los romanos en el capítulo 12 en el verso un queremos hablar un poquito esta mañana acerca del Dios que sobrepasa la materia una vez que lleguen por ahí pueden indicarlo con un Amén la palabra del señor dice así que hermanos os ruego por las misericordias de Dios que presentéis vuestros cuerpos en sacrificio vivo Santo agradable a Dios que es vuestro culto racional no os conforméis a este siglo sino transformaos por medio de la renovación de vuestro entendimiento para que comprobéis cuál sea la buena voluntad de Dios agradable y perfecta digo pues por la gracia que me es dada a cada cual que está entre vosotros que no tenga más alto concepto de sí que el que debe tener sino que piense de Sí con cordura conforme a la medida de fe que Dios repartió a cada uno una escritura conocida en segunda de Corintios [Música] en el capítulo 4 verso 15 lo tienen porque todas estas cosas padecemos por amor a vosotros para que abundando la gracia por medio de muchos la Acción de Gracias sobreabunde para gloria de Dios por tanto no desmayamos Antes aunque este nuestro hombre exterior se va desgastando el interior no obstante se renueva de día en día porque esta leve tribulación momentánea produce en nosotros un cada vez más excelente y eterno peso de [Música] Gloria No mirando nosotros las cosas que se ven sino las que no se ven pues las cosas que se ven son temporales pero las que no se ven son eternas porque sabemos que si es si nuestra morada terrestre este tabernáculo se deshiciere tenemos de Dios un edificio una casa no hecha de manos eterna en los cielos el verso 51 inclin nuestro rostros padre celestial Gracias te damos esta mañana Señor por la oportunidad de estar frente a tu pueblo un domingo de resurrección un domingo de victoria un domingo cuando tú te levantaste de entre los muertos y diste esa promesa por cuanto yo vivo vosotros también viviréis Señor gracias esta mañana te pedimos que inspires nuestros labios nuestros pensamientos y también los corazones que recibirán tu palabra Señor gracias por todo encomendamos el servicio en tus manos para honra y gloria tuya [Música] am tomen asiento también reciban saludos de mi esposa había olvidado decirles eso entendemos que estamos en el tiempo del fin Las edades Las edades están concluyendo las edades han terminado la puerta de los gentiles se está ahora mismo cerrando y Dios está preparando un pueblo para poder llevárselo a casa llevárselo en un rapto glorioso Y eso es lo que nosotros estamos esperando el profeta dijo que las profecías se han cumplido y la única cosa que queda la única cosa que resta y que nosotros estamos esperando es el rapto de la iglesia porque sabemos que el mundo se está preparando para un evento de este lado podemos ver al mundo preparándose para lo que viene para ellos pero en el otro lado podemos ver un pueblo también preparándose para lo que viene a recibirlo a ellos el mundo se está preparando para un tiempo de angustia el mundo se está preparando para ese evento llamado la gran tribulación todo está preparándose todos ellos están preparándose para eso su su vista Solamente les permite ver la gran tribulación Ellos no saben lo que está pasando Ellos no saben lo que viene hacia ellos pero hablemos un poco del grupo que está al otro lado esos son ustedes nosotros no estamos esperando gran tribulación porque el profeta dice antes que las plagas vengan Nos iremos a casa el profeta dijo antes que las bombas azoten la tierra Nos iremos a casa todo esto se está terminando Las edades están acabando Dios ha enviado su mensaje Dios enviado su profeta Dios nos envió el profeta que necesitábamos para este de la iglesia yo no espero un profeta más estoy esperando un octavo Ángel mensajero estamos esperando la venida de nuestro señor Jesucristo avivami más grande que el avivamiento Pentecostal un Avivamiento que va a cambiar mi cuerpo un Avivamiento que va a cambiar mis canas un Avivamiento que va a levantar a los muertos de la tumba un aviamiento para la novia del cordero y eso es para usted y eso es para m eso es lo que esto solamente vea lo que hay en el mundo es triste ver la imagen que hay en el mundo están en esclavitud dice el profeta No hay cosa más triste que ver a alguien que es esclavo él no hace lo que él quiere hacer él él hace lo que su dueño le dice que le haga eso es lo que es el mundo Ellos están en esclavitud el profeta Dice que allá en cincinati él fue un zoológico y miró muchos animales ahí qu mir un león quizás mir un tigre pero hubo algo que llamó la atención de él hubo alguien que tocó su corazón una y í estaba un águila dice el profeta es la imagen más triste que yo haya visto esa águila estaba golpeándose en contra de esa jaula ella quería volar ella quería irse pero ella no podía porque había una jaula que la estaba encerrando dice alguien malvado le había robado la libertad el problema no estaba en sus alas porque sus alas eran fuertes para volar el problema no estaba en en las plumas de ella el problema no era en la naturaleza Ella tenía la naturaleza de águila aleluya ohy yo le digo esta mañana Usted no tiene la naturaleza de un halcón usted tiene la naturaleza de un águila usted tiene las alas de un águila usted tiene las plumas de un águila y esta mañana usted tiene la revelación de una u no hay jaula que pueda mantenerlo atado Somos libres esta mañana la biblia dice todo aquel que elijo libertar será verdaderamente libre Oh para eso vino la palabra para eso vino el mensaje no para atarnos en credos y dogmas no para atarnos en legalism pero para liberarnos en la libertad gloriosa hij de Dios [Aplausos] gloria sea dada al Señor hay depresión que nos ata muchas veces atados por nerviosismo atados por depresiones atados por ansiedad y usted va al doctor y el doctor le dice le voy a enseñar algunas técnicas de relajación para que usted pueda vivir con eso profeta de Dios dijo toda enfermedad es un [Aplausos] demonio usted no puede vivir con un demonio al lado tenemos un Dios que sobrepasa la luz que sobrepasa la materia que no nos enseña a vivir con las enfermedades él nos dijo que por su llaga hemos sido sanados somos libres esta mañana es solo ir al Calvario porque cuando vamos al Calvario ual no hay grandes y pequeños en el calvario Ah es que él es un predicador él puede ir al Calvario él predica bonito entonces él puede ir al Calvario pero yo no puedo ir al Calvario yo no tengo habilidades para ir al Calvario dé decirle algo esta mañana en el calvario todos somos iguales no hay predicador en el calvario todos somos pecadores en el calvario todos necesitamos de algo en el calvario no hay grandes en el calvario en el calvario estamos viendo directamente a la obra de alguien mayor que nosotros El Predicador alguien mayor que el pastor alguien mayor que el director de alabanzas yo estoy contento esta mañana porque puedo decir que soy salvo con la obra de alguien mayor alguien que derramó su sangre en la cruz del Calvario para que pudiera tener compañerismo con él esta mañana dice amoria sea al señor todos somos iguales en el calvario pero vamos al mensaje si no me voy a tomar do horas hoy van a recamar hermano Mateo trajo un predicador tan extenso todo esto comenzó allá antes de la fundación del mundo cuando Dios dice el profeta ni siquiera era Dios él era él era la fuerza él era el autoexistente él era Elohim él habitaba en sí mismo podemos ir allí atrás en el pasado dice el profeta parémonos en Los barandales de la eternidad y veamos lo que pasó en el principio yo no creo que somos más que nadie pero tenemos una mente profética y con la mente deo podemos ver lo que pasó allá ese Dios eterno ese Dios que todo lo puede ese Dios que lo llena to todo todo todo ese dios quería darse a conocer esa F de vida eter só una luz la Biblia le llama la palabra la Biblia le llama el verbo pero en el griego la Biblia llama el logos [Aplausos] descendió cond descendió y moró en esa luz era eso era Dios dándose a conocer Los Ángeles lo [Aplausos] vieron inmediatamente comenzaron a adorar supieron la única fente de vida ese Dios en ese momento amados hermanos estaba pensando en usted y estaba pensando en m Yo quiero decirle el es un mentiroso porque llega y le dice Tú no eres importante Tú no vales nada decirle desde el principio Dios pensó en usted antes de que Dios creara aú un ángel nosotros estábamos en la mente eterna de Dios é no se detuvo ahí él no se detuvo allí arriba en la eternidad él cond descendió y se hizo un cuerpo él creó materia porque nosotros vivimos en tiempo luz y materia materia es todo aquello que podemos tocar esto es materia el parlante que está aquí es materia la guitarra que está aquí es materia el pedazo de papel acá es materia todo lo que podemos palpar es materia el púlpito es materia él es materia también yo soy materia también usted es materia eso es lo que Dios hizo Dios hizo la materia y y cuando hizo esta tierra é él puso leyes en esta tierra hay una en la física estudia las leyes que hay en la Tierra pero aunque Dios haya hecho la materia a mí me encanta el Dios que servimos porque él no está atado a las leyes de la materia él va más allá de las leyes de la materia hay una ley aquí en la tierra que dice que mis pies deben permanecer en el suelo llama la fuerza de gravedad es una ley y pero pero a Dios no le importa la ley de gravedad los científicos dicen que Dios no puede romper las leyes de la física pero mi Biblia dice que a Dios no le importa las leyes de la gravedad hubo un hombre en el libro de Génesis tu hacer fue caminar con Dios y la ley de gravedad perdió su fuerza delante de yo creo yo s de un pueblo esta mañana que está caminando con Dios y un de estos la ley de gravedad perderá y los que hayamos quedado seros levantados y le veremos a él en el aire tocaremos a él le abrazaremos a él y estaremos para siempre con él alguien lo cree esta mañana dale a Dios a Dios no le importan las leyes de la materia las leyes de la materia me dicen que cuando este cuerpo pierde toda su energía está muerto y ahí termina la vida no hay amenes a eso es que eso no es para ustedes esa ley no no aplica a Dios Y tampoco aplica al pueblo de Dios cuando Dios se hizo materia no lo pudieron entender lo mal entendieron dijeron her Yo tengo un problema y se lo voy a decir yo he encontrado un error en usted y el hermano br dijo Yo espero que solo sea uno El problema es que usted hace mucho alar del Señor Jesús ese es el problema que tien hermano br Esa muchachita era una maestra de escuela dominical y ella su fe estaba basada en la cómo se llama se llama ciencia ciencia cristiana y la ciencia cristiana enseña algo que la mente está por encima que si usted tiene un dolor de cabeza y usted dice no tengo nada no tengo nada todo está en mi mente su mente es capaz de sanarlo a usted eso es lo que explica la ciencia cristiana pero profeta dice no es la ciencia sobre la materia es fe es el poder de Dios para sanar le dijo al profeta Jesús era solamente un hombre profeta dijo dem sus argumentos es que é lloró era un problema para ella pero nosotros lo entendemos esta mañana tenemos un mensaje que es la palabra revelada y ese mensaje nos dice que él era hombre en la carne pero era Dios en el espíritu el profeta dijo ella solamente estaba viendo al hombre cansado estaba viendo al hombre [Aplausos] llorando y a mí me encanta como lo dice el profeta pero yo puedo ver cuando él endereza sus hombros Oh cuando él se para de frente a la tumba de laro ese no era un hombre ese era la resurrección y la vida cuando él dijo Lázaro fuera la muerte no pudo retenerlo más Hay Poder en su palabra Era ese hombrecito muriendo en la cruz pero un domingo por la mañana unas mujercitas iban para la tumba llevaban especias y llevaban perfumes porque quizá el cuerpo ya estaba oliendo mal pero qué sorpresa cuando llegaron allá iban buscando alguien muerto le pregunto esta mañana Quiénes vinieron de la denominación Quiénes vinieron acá levant la mano Sin quizá cuando usted vino acá usted decía Quiz otro credo quizás otro dogma porque ygas hechos por el hombre Yo no quiero ser duro pero están muertos el único lugar donde hay vida la palabra no con algo hecho por el hombre pero con la palabra viva Y esa palabra hoy esta mañana está viviendo en un pueblo que se está [Aplausos] preparando ell llegaron a esa tumba y él estaba vivo el día de hoy iglesia él está vivo todavía quiero decirle esta mañana que él no solamente él se materializó pero también a nosotros a nosotros nos puso en un cuerpo de materia y ese cuerpo está sujeto a fallas Y cómo hizo esa materia nuestra lo hizo del polvo de la tierra yo traje un poquito acá yo voy a herir sus sentimientos esta mañ pero me van a seguir [Risas] amando Yo quiero decirle hermano Luis esto lo que tengo aquí Esto es lo que usted es si él es orgulloso se va a sentir mal conmigo Yo quiero decirle hermanito esto es usted parece que no le gusta hermano Perdóneme pero esto es lo que es usted no se ría usted también hermano usted es esto que usted también hermano Hermano Jason Lo siento eso es lo que usted es ese hermano nos dijo que éramos tierra yo no lo digo lo dice la Biblia yo no lo digo lo dice el profeta de Dios hermana sar Esto es lo que hay una imagen ahí hermano tal vez la podemos ver hay 16 elementos acá el profeta Menciona algunos de ellos yo nunca encontré que él mencionara los 16 completos Pero eso no me hace pensar que él esta herrado si él dijo que eran 16 tenían que ser 16 sabía dónde lo había tomado Así que Yo investigué busqué una enciclopedia y yo encontré esos 16 elementos yo Quiz Usted lo sabe en la escuela quizás los miró pero para que nos recordemos lo que somos aquí están en esta pantalla ustedes un poquito de hidrógeno usted es un poquito de oxígeno usted es un poquito de carbono de nitrógeno y todo lo que está aquí calcio fósforo potasio magnes si nos duelen los huesos corremos a comprar potasio porque lo Estamos perdiendo sio Fall nuestro organismo calcio necesito sodio necesito zinc porque usted sabe a partir de los 25 años nada vuelve a ser igual todo cambia y esos elementos empiezan a decrecer y necesitamos conseguirlos en algún lugar es algo de adentro buscando algo que está afuera Gloria a Dios pero no solamente somos estos porque dentro de nosotros hay una Simiente de vida y también necesita algo que está fuera y no encontramos en Iglesia Bautista no lo encontramos en los pentecostales Ah lo que somos Lo siento aquí hay un poquito de y crear vida de ahí pueden traer a Einstein pueden traer cualquiera Y decirle aquí hay 16 elementos los mismos 16 que están en mí Haga vida crea un ser humano de acá no puede hacerlo pueden hacer robot pu pueden hacer ciudades inteligentes pueden hacer teléfonos inteligentes pueden hacer Inteligencia artificial pero no pueden crear vida porque solamente hay una fuente de vida y tiene un nombre nuestro señor Jesucristo [Aplausos] Qué necesitamos en estos ingredientes necesitamos algo que se llama luz cósmica Y eso no lo venden en Walmart eso no lo venden en [Risas] eso no lo encontramos ahí hermanos Dios tomó del polvo de la tierra y puso ese aliento de vida puso luz cósmica hermanos y unió todos esos elementos y y y creó a un ser humano se llama luz cósmica ahora esa luz cósmica están poniendo atención dice el hermano que me vine vestido como profesor entonces pongan atención yo trabajo de profesor en H Entonces esta mañ usted quiere saber cómo está compuesta esa luz cósmica quieren saber está hecha por cuatro rayos yo voy a leer del sonido incierto el profeta de Dios dice ahora cuando fuimos hechos cuando fuimos hechos y ellos acaban de dar cuenta recientemente que el cuerpo de ustedes está lleno de luz los rayos x prueban eso los rayos x No tienen su propia luz es la luz de ustedes la que usa Escucha esto después de un tiempecito digamos que a los 25 años de edad Quiénes tienen 25 años [Risas] 25 ya pasó de los 25 d decirle d decirle usted acaba de perder un rayo de esos cuatro que tiene No se preocupe que tiene tres sigue diciendo y a los 35 años otro Rayo se pierde de esa luz cósmica yo acabo de perder el segundo Rayo sigue diciendo y a los 40 años otro Rayo se pierde ayer perdió uno y hasta [Risas] celebramos y finalmente cuando ustedes pasan como a los 65 esc cuando pasa los están viviendo en su último Rayo Qué cosa más tremenda allá en Panamá yo predi esto y una anciana se acercó a mí y me dijo Yo estoy viviendo en el último rayo y siento que se está encendiendo y apagando Estoy a punto de irme Entonces qué qué va a pasar conmigo Porque estos 16 elementos necesitan los cósmica pero nosotros Eso es para el Humano común nosotros no vivimos solamente de luz cósmica porque la revelación de la palabra nos dice que el día que venimos a Cristo el día que usted nació de nuevo esa luz eterna no luz cósmica luz eterna luz eterna está viviendo en usted Este cuerpo muestra que la luz cósmica se está acabando a mí no me importa eso porque dentro de mi alma hay una luz eterna que no puede ser acabada apagada los cielos y tierra pasarán pero su palabra no pasará y su palabra está viviendo en ti su palabra está viviendo en usted aleluya gloria a Dios eso es Dios el Dios que sobrepasa la materia él es Luz él sobrepasa la luz cósmica y presenta delante de nosotros luz eterna Gloria a Dios dale un aplauso al Señor esta [Aplausos] ma y si algo pasa con esa materia Dios puede repararlo él puede repararlo para que usted siga su camino y siga creciendo su en el señor alguien cree que puede hacerlo Yo creo que puede hacerlo una vez esa luz una vez esa luz se hizo carne y caminó entre nosotros y se encontró con un hombre ciego no había perdido la vista había nacido sin ojos se acercó a él y le dijo los discípulos le dijeron a él qué pasó con este hombre quién pecó pecó él o pecaron sus padres el mundo siempre está buscando explicaciones explicaciones él trae la solución al problema Dios es acción Dios no es teoría Dios es acción é dijo No se preocupen yo puedo repararlo ni él pecó ni sus padres pecaron es para que la gloria de Dios sea manifestada hay cosas que ocurren iglesia no por pecados no por errores es porque Dios está esperando que usted pueda creerle a él y tomarlo en su palabra Gloria a Dios él tomó tierra de los tomó polvo de la tierra Porque porque ese ciego había hecho había nacido o había sido hecho de la Tierra lo que iba a reparar era materia entonces iba a tomar materia y escupió Oh qué cosa más asquerosa lodo hecho con saliva y vas a dejar hombre ciego que él te ponga esa saliva en los ojos eso se ve feo V a dejar lo que lo haga él sabía que era la única forma de venir tomó saliva tomó polvo de la Tierra y la puso en sus ojos y aqu empezó empezó a materializarse y a crear ojos cuando Dios necesitaba reparar materia el cuerpo de un hombre usó materia Pero cuando Dios necesita reparar el alma de alguien Oh él no va a usar polvo de la tierra va usar su palabra es por eso que venimos a la iglesia porque porque su palabra es predicada ahí y el libro de salmos dice que él ha enviado su palabra Para sanar nuestras enfermedades y librarnos de la ruina aleluya gloria a Dios Usted dice eso fue hace 2000 años en los 60 uneta [Música] cuenta que tampoco tenía ojos y se acercó al siervo de Dios el mismo Dios que el mismo Don que estaba en Cristo estaba en su profeta cuando la muchachita se acercó y le dijo Yo quiero recibir mi vista é le dijo tú crees que Dios puede hacerlo Ella dijo claro que Dios puede hacerlo él se agachó y empezó a orar por ella y empezó a decir señor crea señor crea crea ojos espera un momento qué color quieres los ojos hermanos quizá yo estoy loco porque yo no vi esa cosa pero yo lo creo yo no vi a Jesús pero yo le creo yo no vi a William br pero yo creo que este es su mensaje y que Dios se movió ahí Y sabes por lo creo porque él es el mismo Ayer hoy por todos los siglos Jesucristo [Aplausos] me llené de tierra pero me dijeron que estaba en casa sabes qu puede hacer Dios si el problema es con la materia Dios puede Dios puede reparar eso voy a terminar acá hace casi do años nació mi segundo hijo y yo estaba contento porque iba a abrazar a mi segundo hijo el mayor de mis hijos está aquí conmigo pero el pequeño olam nació el año pasado el año antepasado Y entonces cuando él nació fue una sorpresa no agradable que vino con él porque cuando lo vimos parecía que todo estaba bien mi esposa pudo quien estaba con mi esposa me mandó una foto del niño yoes comencé a ver la fotografía dije quiero que te fijes en las orejas del niño y cuando ella se fijó ella me mandó a llamar sucede que los conductos estaban cerrados y una de sus orejas estaba más pequeña que la otra nosotros no sabíamos qué hacer sa los hospitales en Honduras ellos no ellos no dan explicaciones ni siquiera sabían lo que estaba pasando mi esposa tenía una cesárea entonces esa misma noche conseguimos la orden para llevarlo llevar a mi niño a otro doctor el pediatra lo revisó y dijo no podemos hacer nada ahorita váyanse a casa y a los días a los meses y ustedes hagan este este y este examen vayan con un audiólogo Cuando llegamos a la primera cita con el audiólogo él ella revisó eh al niño estaba tan cerrado el canal de su lado derecho del lado derecho de mi niño que casi no podía ver lo que había dentro el otro oído tenía el agujero un poquito más grande Así que puso un aparatito allí adentro y él dijo ella dijo no veo el tímpano y parece allá adentro que que que no se formó el oído interno Y en el otro oído metieron algo muy delgado y cuando vieron adentro Ella dijo No veo nada tímpano cuando ella nos dijo eso mi esposa empezó a llorar ella le dijo No se preocupe vamos vamos a hacer una prueba para ver si él está recibiendo sonido emp a ver su máquina pori horas enviando señales de sonido a los oídos del niñ despu horas hauch y está y el oído interno no se formó Cuántas son madres aquí se imaginan cómo se sintió mi esposa estaba destrozada inmediat el domingo siguiente yo empecé a mandar textos a los ministros y a los amigos que tengo en otros lugares la iglesia comenzó a orar hermano Luis y la iglesia de él comenzaron a orar empezamos a orar a orar y a orar por dos meses porque nosotros veíamos que no podíamos aceptar lo que los médicos estuvieran diciendo Yo recuerdo que mi niño estaba dormido el perro estaba ladrando fuera mi niño mayor estaba jugando y tira la puerta y mi niño no se despertaba yo recuerdo que me acercaba al oído de mi niño y yo le decía Jesucristo es el mismo Ayer hoy por todos los siglos hermano yo no voy a hacer largo esto yo solo voy a decirle algo Dios es capaz de sobrepasar todo lo que la carne significa mi niño no tenía no tenía tímpano su oído interno no había sido desarrollado Así que fuimos hacer otro test otra prueba porque estábamos viendo algo que el niño estaba balbuceando entonces algo estaba pasando ahí cómo es que el niño no puede oír pero est balbuceando así que lo llevamos a otro doctor y lo llevamos con la referencia de la primer doctora él no puso todos los aparatos que puso la primera doctora solo miró con esa cosita que ellos tienen adentro y dijo volvió a ver no tiene tímpano losos interno no se formar y volví a ver volvió a agarrar y volvió a ver y me dijo tómele una foto a la computadora porque en toda mi experiencia toda mi experiencia me dice que es es un tímpano [Aplausos] usted dice quizás se equivocó el doctor No señor eso es lo que el enemigo podría decirme A mí ayer hablé con mi hijo y me dijo papá y me dijo Adi y me dijo good Aleluya Ese es el Dios que yo Teo Ese es el Dios que yo le presento a usted el Dios que está sobre toda la materia sabes qué Ora por mi hijo porque cuando vamos en la calle y él escucha rap é le hace [Risas] él está escuchando Así que si usted piensa que la historia de Jesús reparando la materia hace 2000 años y el testimonio del hermano bram trayendo ojos existencia es demasiado viejo que hay en Honduras tenemos un caso Gloria a Dios podemos testificar que es el mismoy hoy por todos los sigos Aleluya ahora si él puede hacer eso con la carne Si él puede hacer eso con la materia traiga su alma a la palabra traiga sus necesidades a la palabra es el mismo Ayer hoy por tod un aplauso al señor no importa si se acaban esos cuatro Rayos de la luz cósmica usted y yo tenemos esa luz eterna no puede apagarse pal padre amado Gracias te damos por tu bondad Gracias por tu misericordia se señor esta mañana ha sido un privilegio estar en este lugar y hablar a esta gente tan amorosa señor si algo fue dicho perdónanos que ellos se queden con lo que los ministros están enseñando y otra cosa padre si alguien está enfermo en su
