TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you good morning everyone god bless you we are going to stand and pray to start i'm going to continue my subject on christian character part 11 and this time though it will be on the theme of humility let's pray heavenly father we come to you now lord and we ask that you would just move in our hearts lord take your word and just reach it down deep deep into our souls lord that we might be pleasing to you that we might glorify you with our lives lord help us just to empty ourselves get ourselves out of the way lord that we each of us both speaker and hearer can be a vessel used for your glory we ask these things in jesus name amen first scripture we're going to look at as you're standing is isaiah 14 and we're going to look at 13 through 15. strange verse to start your subject of humility but i think you'll see where i'm going this is satan speaking for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shall be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit then genesis chapter 3 verse 4 and 5 and the serpent said to the woman you shall not surely die and i'm going to read from the esv here for god knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like elohim you'll be like god knowing good and evil amen may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated pride is the root of sin the first sins both in heaven and on earth starts with pride so if we take the up reverse of that what is the reverse of that humility humility and pride go together what they're the opposite of each other let's let's look more closely humility in the definition in webster dictionary says in ethics freedom from pride and arrogance humbleness of mind a moderate estimate of one's own worth in theology humility consists in lowliness of mind a deep sense of one's own unworthiness in the sight of god self-abasement penitence for sin and submission to the divine will so then we need to define pride webster's dictionary also this is from pride is inordinate self-esteem an unreasonable conceit of one's own superiority in talents beauty wealth accomplishments rank or elevation in office which manifests which manifests itself in lofty heirs distance reserve and often in contempt of one another andrew murray says this about humility the root of all virtue and grace of all faith and acceptable worship is that we know that we have nothing but what we receive and we bow in deepest humility to wait upon god for it i think humility is too often an overlooked characteristic of a believer but if you look closely and what what andrew murray just said is absolutely true it's the root of holiness and it's the foundation for the christian life without humility you're not even you can't even go to baptism you can't even be born again because it starts with repentance you you hear the word of god and it causes you to say oh i'm a sinner i'm i'm deserving of nothing but death and pain i repent of my sins i turn to without humbling ourselves you can't even take the first steps towards salvation so humility is really the root of every good work in a christian's life i want to think i want you to think about pride and humility together really it's a measurement those two things are a measurement of self think of our thermometer when the mercury climbs that means it's it's the temperature is getting higher right so when the mercury drops the temperature is getting lower so think of that as self when the mercury grows goes up self is getting filled up you're getting filled up with self it's a measure really pride and humility is a measurement of how much god is in your life so if there's if there's self there's no god but we're at the same time we're all in a process we're learning to get more and more and more and more humble christian growth doesn't make you more haughty more selfish christian growth makes you less on self and more on god and others so when the mercury goes down and it empties out now there's humility now there's room for god in your life the lower that mercury is the more there is of god the the more there in other words the more there is of humility emptying of self more god can flow through james 4 10 says humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up that's the christian ethic if you want to be successful lose yourself in god you don't want to establish the self fight for the self you want to be in that position where you're getting you're surrendering yourself it's not it's not like buddhism where the self is erased and there's no more self and now you're one with the universe we're not talking about buddhism we're talking about christianity which is self surrender it's not that the self doesn't exist the self continues to exist it's just that the self now is totally satisfied in god because it's fully surrendered its life everything in its life to god that is where we find humility john newton the author of amazing grace says i'm persuaded that love and humility are the highest attainments in the school of christ and the brightest evidences that he is indeed our master john wesley says humility and patience are the surest proofs of the increase of love and andrew murray again in his book on holiness or his book on humility is here is the path to a higher life down lower down just as the water always seeks and fills the lowest place so the moment god finds men abased and empty his glory and power flow in to exalt and to bless do you want a revival in your life in the church this is the key it's not shouting and screaming it's surrendering more of yourself and saying i am nothing what i think what i want to do means nothing the only thing i want is god when that happens then you'll have a revival and you'll have a rival and you'll have a revival god himself is revealed in simplicity or humility if you go back and look at that sermon brother branham again over and over again interchanges the words god humbles himself god is revealed in humility psalm 113 5 and 6 says this who is like unto the lord our god who dwelleth on high who humbles himself to behold the things that are in heaven and in the earth so god dwells on high and even looking on what's going on in heaven and on earth god is humbling himself so imagine god is coming to you to reveal himself to you he is coming in humility and further than that god always takes as paul says he takes the base things the things that are nothing in order to use them to reveal himself through in easton's bible dictionary it says that humility is a prominent christian grace it's a state of mind well pleasing to god it preserves the soul and tranquility and makes us patient under trials christ has set us an example of humility we should be led there too by a remembrance of our sins and by the thought that it is it is the way to honor and that the greatest promises are made to the humble it is a great paradox in christianity that it makes humility the avenue to glory in the world in the world pride and self promotion i mean think about social media think about our our republican president what what what do they do point to it's pointing to me our famous picture today is the selfie think about that i'm not saying don't take take pictures of yourself uh i'm just saying what's the what what is in our heart are we are we humble or are we just pointing to ourselves the the whole spirit of the age is point to yourself show off yourself self is most important it's the opposite of christianity don't young people old people all people don't get caught up in this self-centered life it's not about you god wants to use you to help other people that should be our focus in life is not ourselves but god and others so let's look at the example of humility that christ set starting with looking in philippians chapter 2 and we're going to look through verses 3 to 11. let nothing be done through strife strife means selfish ambition and it implies rivalry so don't do anything through selfish ambition to get a leg up to get to be better than other people and then it says or vainglory vainglory means pride without proper basis empty conceit but in lowliness word lowliness means humility but in lowliness humility of mind let each esteem other better than themselves okay this is this is a start how are you going to look at the world how are you going to look at those around you what is your attitude of mind towards those i'm better than them i'm better than this one that's antichrist thinking god tells us commands us to think of other people as better than ourselves that that doesn't mean that we need to have we need to just hey i'm terrible i'm evil i'm bad you know people that that's false fake humility that that's a sure sign that they think a lot of themselves but no one else does and i'm feeling sorry for myself that's not humility humility is not thinking less of ourselves i think it was c.s lewis that said that it's not thinking uh thinking less of ourselves it's thinking of ourselves less in other words it's not about it's not about me and what i want i exist for the betterment of others verse 4 look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others this isn't saying that we need to abandon all property and and all concern about taking care of ourselves and our family what it's saying is of course you're going to think about the things that you need to take care of for yourself and for others that's part of our giving glory to god is taking care of our soul and presenting our our bodies as a living sacrifice presenting our cells outwardly which would reflect the reality that's on the inside it's not saying anything about that we shouldn't think about that what it's saying is when you're thinking about your own things don't just think about your own things also also think about the things of others in other words what is it saying back to the verse before think about the betterment and the help and the blessing of others in other words observe what's going on in the lives of people around you doesn't mean observe it and go tell everybody about it it means observe it and take action and start with prayer god what would you have me to do i see this person is lonely i see this person has a need i see this person needs a b and c lord what would i what should i do about that and he says do this then go do that it's not about looking on it and then spreading that to others or even going to the pastor and saying you need to do something it's it's saying pay attention to what's going on around you and help meet the needs of those who are hurting look not every man on his own things but every man on the things of others then he says let this mind it's the same subject it's not a different subject let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus so here he's bringing the example who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god in other words he didn't think it was a prize to be grasped and held on to to be equal with god he just was that's what he was but he knew that the way of being equal with god was this but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men so his his response to being found in the form of a man was to take upon himself the form of a servant brother branham tells us he was god jesus was god on morpha god in form he was the visible expression of god he never stopped being that he it wasn't as though he put that aside when he was humble when he was serving when he was submitting himself that was expressing the the invisible god that was expressing the heart of god and was made in the likeness of men verse 8 and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross satan's way is to exalt self to gain prominence by putting yourself forward pushing yourself thrusting yourself into power and authority god's way of exaltation is lowering yourself and saying i'm i'm a lamb i want the dove god to lead me to lead me to the place that i'm going to be what was god's will for jesus christ death on the cross and he said not nevertheless not my will but thine be done it should be our prayer daily not my will thine be done humble yourself wherefore verse 9 god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father the way i think the prophet puts it this way the way up is down the way to success and exaltation is to humble yourselves to lower yourself down what does that look like though you know i hear the word humble and if some it for some reason it feels very intangible to me how do i really grasp what it means to humble myself how do i go about doing that there's a there's a false humility paul talks about it in the in his letter to the philippians there's a false humility that a person can put on but then there's a reality a real humility let's look at the life of jesus it'll tell us exactly what humility is john 5 19 then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things so ever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise i can do nothing of myself john 5 30 i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which has sent me john 6 38. for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me john 8 29 and he that sent me is with me the father has not left me alone for i do always those things that please him do you want the presence of god in your life i do what's the secret jesus tells us for i do always those things that please him verse 50 of the same chapter john 8 50 and i seek not mine own glory there is one that seeketh and judgeth john 14 verse 10. believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works we want to be one with god we want to have and to do that we have to have true humility and we want to be a vessel that he uses for his glory this is the key let's look at what jesus says i can do nothing i didn't come to do my own will i do always those things that please him i seek not my own glory i speak not of myself and i do the will of the father that sent me that is humility that it is not it is not again thinking you're terrible it's understanding who you are and and understanding the purpose god has for you and it's knowing that whatever that whatever you have comes from him and whatever you do you don't want to do anything unless it's him guiding you and leading you to do it in other words you've lost all sense of your own desires your own plan your own dreams you've thrown them in the dust and said i'm gods i am god's and we understand that that's not a path of joyless drudgery that's a path to happiness that's the path to joy the only real one the only one that lasts for all eternity brother branham says this in 1961 perfect strength by perfect we weakness but we must all come in one way that's come knowing that we are nothing and he's all and being willing to surrender ourselves to him in order to receive benefits from him listen to this man who was a warrior had stripped himself amen if there's anything that our schools needs today if it's anything our churches needs today is a stripping of themselves of your own thoughts and your own abilities strip yourselves before god unless you try to do something within yourselves wow i hope you that gets down deep to us both here and the tape world too that you realize that you've got to become nothing not a know-it-all not a great somebody but a nobody amen i love that let's join the band of nobodies i want to be the first member i'm a nobody i'm nothing i'm not a know-it-all i'm not a great somebody you've got to get to a place that you you know that you're nothing and don't never rise above that for as soon as you rise above above it you rise above god wow when when we leave the path of humility we leave the path of god matthew 8 verse 18 verse 4 whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven luke 14 11 for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humble himself humbleth himself shall be exalted if you humble yourselves that's the way to success with god if you take pride in yourself in who you are that's the way to be a based to put down in the dust in the sermon three witnesses in 1951 brother branham says what is it friends jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever be humble let yourself be the lowest of all don't ever exalt yourself if you do you're going to become a beast humble yourself and god will lift you up don't figure that god owes you anything remember you owe him all right and we're not under obligation or god's not under obligation to us we are under obligation to god amen let's stand and pray gracious heavenly father we thank you lord for your word we asked lord that in in this humility that your power would come and be man manifested in us and through us lord help us to remember that we are nothing and that we would never rise above that place lord i pray that you would fill each one with your spirit that you would move in the service today lord as as you sow will to move help us to just push ourselves and our thoughts and our ideas out of the way that you might flow through us we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen
