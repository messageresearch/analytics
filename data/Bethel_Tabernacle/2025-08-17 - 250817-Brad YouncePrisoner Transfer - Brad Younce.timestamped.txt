[0:00] happy to be in church. Let's all stand.
[0:02] Let's bow our heads and have a word of
[0:04] prayer.
[0:06] Father, we just thank you for this day
[0:08] you give us, Lord. This opportunity to
[0:10] come into your house again. Father, I
[0:12] just pray you'd be with us today.
[0:14] Father, bless this portion of the
[0:16] morning service. Lord, bless the main
[0:18] service, our preachers when we speak
[0:20] into us today. Father, we need your
[0:22] anointing to come down the service
[0:23] today. Father, your people has many
[0:25] needs, Lord. May you grant their needs
[0:28] according to your riches and glory.
[0:29] Father, we just love you in Jesus name.
[0:31] Amen.
[0:33] Um I want to read in Colossians chap 1
[0:36] verse 12 and 13.
[0:41] This is uh all of a sudden
[0:44] brother Matthew Smith was supposed to
[0:46] this morning but
[0:48] I think he's got sick or something. And
[0:51] so
[0:53] I kind of told Brother Jason, I kind of
[0:55] woke up early this morning
[0:59] on my mind. You're doing Sunday school.
[1:01] I said, "Whoa, I better do something
[1:03] real quick." Then I seen that text and I
[1:06] kind of waited to see if anybody would
[1:08] take it, but nobody nobody did. But it's
[1:14] this is the will of the Lord. Colossians
[1:16] 1:12, giving thanks unto the Father,
[1:18] which hath made us meat to be partakers
[1:20] of the inheritance of the saints in
[1:22] light, who hath delivered us from the
[1:24] power of darkness, and hath translated
[1:27] us into the kingdom of his dear son. And
[1:31] God bless you. Have your seats. You
[1:33] know, for a title, I title this a
[1:36] prisoner transfer.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:40] Colossians 1 at 11:13 again it says who
[1:42] hath delivered us from the power of
[1:44] darkness and hath translated us into the
[1:47] kingdom which that word translate means
[1:50] transfer removed from one place to
[1:54] another
[1:55] &gt;&gt; it's a change of situation or a place
[1:59] you know you know Paul he he always like
[2:00] to tell people he was a prisoner
[2:03] &gt;&gt; I'm a prisoner I Paul am a prisoner of
[2:05] Christ you know there's several places
[2:07] you know like over here in Filimon
[2:09] chapter 1, Paul says, "I'm Paul."
[2:14] That's the way he introduced himself.
[2:16] Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ. So,
[2:19] what a way to introduce yourself.
[2:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21] &gt;&gt; Good morning. I'm Brad Jce and I'm a
[2:24] prisoner of Jesus Christ.
[2:28] &gt;&gt; You go around this way to introduce
[2:29] yourselves. I'm a prisoner of Christ.
[2:32] You're going to be somebody's prisoner.
[2:34] But Rama says in in a prisoner he says
[2:37] I'd like to make this statement that God
[2:39] always has to take any man that will
[2:42] serve him truly to be his prisoner. A
[2:45] man has to surrender every ambition he's
[2:48] got, everything that he is, everything,
[2:52] his life, soul, body, will, ambitions,
[2:56] and everything else, and became and
[2:59] become a complete prisoner to Christ,
[3:02] who is the word. So, you must know
[3:05] exactly what it means to be a prisoner.
[3:08] &gt;&gt; We're all sitting here this morning, a
[3:10] prisoner.
[3:11] &gt;&gt; You're a prisoner to something.
[3:14] You might not have any chains on you,
[3:16] but if your eyes were opened
[3:17] spiritually, you see, you either got
[3:18] chained by the devil or you're chained
[3:20] by God.
[3:22] Are you a prisoner? A prisoner is a
[3:24] captive.
[3:26] Just simple as that. You're in bonds.
[3:28] You're a prisoner. A prisoner is someone
[3:30] who is physically confined, locked up in
[3:33] a jail, under arrest,
[3:37] deprived of your freedom by another
[3:39] power.
[3:41] You're restricted. You're unable to move
[3:43] about freely and subject to the
[3:45] authority
[3:46] &gt;&gt; of whatever holds you.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; It could be a spiritual or emotional
[3:51] prison. A prison always have to be
[3:54] behind bars. People can be prisoners of
[3:55] sin.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; We're bound by habits. We're bound by
[3:58] addictions or some kind of guilt that
[4:01] controls your life. John 8:34 says,
[4:04] "Whosoever committh sin is a servant of
[4:06] sin."
[4:07] &gt;&gt; So, we're prisoners of circumstances.
[4:09] We're trapped in some kind of fear,
[4:11] worry, or some kind of past mistakes.
[4:15] Prisoners of Christ. We're a prison. How
[4:17] many is a prisoner of Christ this
[4:18] morning? Apostle Paul often called
[4:20] himself a prisoner of of Jesus Christ
[4:22] because Ephesians 3:21 3:1 says, meaning
[4:25] he willingly surrendered his will and
[4:28] freedom to serve Christ.
[4:31] This is a positive imprisonment where
[4:33] love binds the believer to God. You
[4:36] know, sometimes people say, "I'm just a
[4:38] prisoner to my job or a prisoner to my
[4:40] own thoughts." You've heard that. People
[4:42] say that. It means that they feel
[4:43] trapped, restricted, unable to live
[4:45] freely in some area of their life.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; So to be a prisoner means your freedom
[4:50] is restricted and you are held under the
[4:53] control of someone,
[4:55] &gt;&gt; amen,
[4:56] &gt;&gt; or something.
[4:58] &gt;&gt; Either by force like he was in jail or
[5:01] willingly, like Paul was being a
[5:02] prisoner of Christ. So, you're going to
[5:04] be someone's prisoner.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; I'm a prisoner today.
[5:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; But there's things that had to happen in
[5:10] order. You know, when Paul said, "I'm a
[5:12] prisoner of of Christ," things had to
[5:14] happen to Paul.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; Because you know what Paul Paul did
[5:17] before he was a prisoner of Christ. He
[5:20] was a prisoner of of the devil. Because
[5:22] he had, you know, when Stephen was
[5:24] sitting there being stoned, Paul was
[5:26] holding the coats of the people
[5:28] &gt;&gt; witnessing this. And Paul would get up
[5:30] and he would go arrest the Christians.
[5:32] and he he would go persecute them. But
[5:35] one day, Paul was traveling down a road.
[5:39] It was time for a prisoner transfer.
[5:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:41] &gt;&gt; Where Paul was walking around in
[5:43] darkness, headed to a prison.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; To put other people in prison. But
[5:48] somehow here come Jesus walking down in
[5:51] a light. Who are you, Lord? I'm Jesus
[5:54] whom thou persecutest.
[5:56] &gt;&gt; Prisoner transfer. It's from prisoner to
[5:59] from darkness to light. If you belong to
[6:00] God, it don't matter. If you're a
[6:02] prisoner of the devil, that there can be
[6:04] a prisoner transfer.
[6:07] Hallelujah. Of course, one prisoner is
[6:09] prisoner is moved from one p prison to
[6:12] another like from darkness to light.
[6:14] When somebody accepts Christ, you're
[6:16] leaving the devil. You're going toward
[6:17] toward God's liberty because who hath
[6:20] delivered us from the power of darkness
[6:21] has translated us into the kingdom of
[6:23] his dear son. So, you're going from sin
[6:25] to grace. Now a prisoner, Paul says, now
[6:29] a prisoner of Christ from earthly bonds
[6:32] to heavenly freedom. That's where we are
[6:36] on a spiritual transfer is moving from
[6:38] one master to another.
[6:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; And the greatest transfer is when Christ
[6:44] takes us out of Satan's jail and binds
[6:48] us with his love. Thank the Lord.
[6:52] &gt;&gt; Saul was headed to arrest some
[6:54] Christians and put them in prison. But
[6:55] while he was on the road, a light
[6:58] appeared and it knocked Saul down. Saul
[7:01] was like, "Who are you?" He says, "I am
[7:03] Jesus whom thou persecutest."
[7:06] Saul was on his way to get to arrest
[7:08] some Christians. But himself got turned
[7:09] around and got arrested himself. God
[7:12] said, "His name is on my book. It was
[7:14] time for a change. It was time for a
[7:16] prisoner transfer."
[7:19] Jesus had blinded his eyes and Saul had
[7:21] a name change. Hallelujah.
[7:25] Jesus will cross our path one day. Oh
[7:27] yeah.
[7:27] &gt;&gt; And our name was changed.
[7:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; Well, we might have been called Miss
[7:31] Baptist, Miss Catholic, Miss
[7:33] Pentecostal, Miss
[7:36] &gt;&gt; But one day we got arrested.
[7:40] You know, when you get arrested, I don't
[7:42] care who you are, if you're a
[7:43] businessman, if you're a professional
[7:45] athlete, if you're just a normal person,
[7:48] when you get arrested,
[7:51] you lose all your identities.
[7:54] When they are sent to prison, they lose
[7:56] their identity. They take on a new one.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; You're no longer if you're President
[8:02] Trump and somehow you get arrested, put
[8:04] in prison, you're not called Trump. You
[8:06] got a number.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; You get a number put on your on your on
[8:10] your garment here. They're no longer
[8:12] their own person. Praise the Lord. When
[8:15] we got saved, we no longer became our
[8:17] own person. We do what he says. a change
[8:21] in the atmosphere. It'll change your
[8:23] life to live the way he wants us to
[8:25] live.
[8:27] We were out living a normal life. You
[8:30] work, you come home, day after day, we
[8:33] have a life we live. But when you are a
[8:36] prisoner, you have a life change.
[8:40] A prisoner is completely dependent on
[8:43] his capttor.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; When you are a prisoner, you're not your
[8:46] own person.
[8:48] You'll go to bed when they tell you to.
[8:50] You'll get up when they tell you to.
[8:52] You'll say, "It's time to go outside."
[8:54] You'll go when they tell you to. You'll
[8:56] come back in when they tell you to.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; You're a prisoner. You can't do what you
[9:00] want to do.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're going to go outside. You're
[9:03] going to exercise for a while. It's what
[9:04] they tell the prisoners. If you don't
[9:06] want to, you're going anyway. When
[9:08] you're a prisoner, you are marked.
[9:10] You're given a different identification.
[9:12] But when we become a prisoner of Jesus
[9:14] Christ, we become completely dependent
[9:17] on him.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; You know, I can't walk without him.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; I can't talk without him. I can't live
[9:23] without him.
[9:25] I've got to have him every day, every
[9:27] hour. Not every hour, every second. I've
[9:31] got to have him in my life. So, he gives
[9:33] you a choice. You could choose whose
[9:35] prisoner you want to be today.
[9:40] Have we made the right choice?
[9:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're going to be a prisoner to
[9:43] someone, the devil or God. It's our
[9:46] choice. It's it's a decision time.
[9:49] It's prisoner transfer time. If you're
[9:52] going to be a prisoner of something,
[9:53] you're going to be in bondage to the
[9:55] devil or to God.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; You have that choice. That choice is set
[9:59] before us. Exactly. What are you going
[10:02] to do about it? Whose side are you on?
[10:05] &gt;&gt; You have that choice of whose side
[10:07] you're going to be on? One leads to
[10:09] death, the other leads to life. There is
[10:12] no in between. There's no fence sitters.
[10:15] You can't sit be sitting on no fence. I
[10:17] heard a story one time where a man was
[10:20] sitting on a was sitting on the fence
[10:22] and the devil was standing there looking
[10:24] at him and God was on one side going,
[10:27] "Come on. Come on. Get off the fence.
[10:30] Get over here on my side." He looked
[10:32] over at the devil. Devil wasn't even
[10:33] doing anything. But God kept saying,
[10:35] "Come on. Come on. You're on my side.
[10:38] Get on my side of the fence. Come on."
[10:40] He looked back at the devil says, "Why
[10:42] ain't you telling me to come to your
[10:43] side?" He says, ' Because you're already
[10:45] on the fence. You're on my side.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; So there's no fence sitters in this
[10:49] thing. You're going to be a prisoner to
[10:51] something.
[10:53] When you're a prisoner to the devil,
[10:55] he'll tell you to smoke, you'll go
[10:56] smoke. He'll tell you to drink, you'll
[10:58] go drink. He'll tell you to listen to
[11:00] something and you'll listen to it. He'll
[11:02] tell you all kind. He'll say, "Oh, it's
[11:03] just it's just a love song. It don't
[11:06] There's nothing wrong with a good love
[11:07] song.
[11:10] Wow.
[11:13] Dress and act any way you want to when
[11:15] you're by yourself.
[11:18] &gt;&gt; You're not. You're a prisoner.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; You're a prisoner. Oh, go ahead. Mama
[11:23] don't know. Daddy don't know. Husband
[11:25] and wife don't know. Pastor don't know.
[11:27] The church people don't know.
[11:30] Devil tells you to do stuff. But if
[11:32] you're a prisoner of God, God will tell
[11:33] you how to act. God will tell you who
[11:36] you got to act in holiness. You're going
[11:38] to be a prisoner. Let's be bound by God.
[11:40] &gt;&gt; God demands holiness.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; We're not to like to look like the
[11:44] world.
[11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:44] &gt;&gt; But you're going to be someone's
[11:46] prisoner. We don't want to be like
[11:47] Samson.
[11:49] Says Samson gave God his strength to
[11:51] use, but he didn't give God his heart.
[11:54] He gave his heart to Delilah and gave
[11:57] his strength to God. But you've got to
[12:00] surrender
[12:01] soul, body, spirit, strength. So
[12:06] everything you are to the will of God
[12:09] and become a prisoner to him.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; So you're going to be somebody's
[12:14] prisoner.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; You don't belong to yourself. You're
[12:18] somebody's prisoner. You're either a
[12:20] prisoner of the devil knowing this is
[12:22] truth and won't surrender to it or a
[12:24] prisoner to the world and surrender to
[12:26] God. One or the other. You're either the
[12:28] devil's prisoner to sin or you're God's
[12:31] prisoner to righteousness. You're one of
[12:34] the other.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Samson thinks of all his
[12:37] great victories that he had won. And no
[12:39] doubt it come to his mind how that when
[12:41] he was a little boy that God had
[12:43] vindicated him, told his mother how that
[12:46] she must do, not drink strong drinks,
[12:49] watch her die, that she was bringing
[12:50] forth a Nazerite, how she had combed his
[12:53] hair, and told him, "Son, through these
[12:54] locks is a covenant with you that God
[12:57] that your strength will be laid in
[12:59] there. Don't never give it away. Don't
[13:02] never give away your secret. Don't never
[13:04] surrender it. Whatever you do, stay with
[13:07] it. Samson had all this in his mind
[13:10] thinking about all this. But Ephesians
[13:13] 4:1 says, Paul says, "I therefore, the
[13:15] prisoner of the Lord,
[13:18] &gt;&gt; beseech you that ye walk worthy of the
[13:20] vocation wherewith you are called."
[13:24] &gt;&gt; A vocation is just a calling.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; What are you called to? So, it don't
[13:29] matter what you are this morning. If
[13:31] you're a deacon, a trustee, a preacher,
[13:34] a husband, a wife,
[13:37] walk worthy of it.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; If you're a prisoner of Christ, that's
[13:42] what you will do. I therefore, the
[13:44] prison of the Lord beseech you that you
[13:46] walk worthy of the vocation where you're
[13:47] called with all loneliness and meekness.
[13:51] Take, you know, take my yoke upon me and
[13:53] learn of me for I am meek and lowly in
[13:55] heart. That's what Jesus says. And you
[13:57] shall find rest unto your souls. So with
[14:00] all low and longsuffering forbearing,
[14:03] putting up with one another. I mean
[14:06] that's a prisoner. That's part of being
[14:08] a prison. Yeah. Putting up with one
[14:09] another.
[14:11] And brother Bram says in Christ the
[14:12] mystery of God revealed.
[14:14] Love one another above everything.
[14:18] Love one another. No matter what the
[14:20] devil tries to say. You're all one great
[14:24] sweet group now.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; But remember my warning. Satan won't let
[14:28] you stay that way.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; He'll shoot everything he has to bring
[14:33] somebody in to make his target. He'll
[14:36] bring some critic or unbeliever in, sit
[14:39] him down, cause him to fellowship with
[14:41] you under the quietness and things. Then
[14:43] he'll shoot that guy with some kind of
[14:45] poison and he'll start through the
[14:47] church with it. Don't you take sides
[14:50] with it. Don't you have nothing to do
[14:52] with anything else. you stay right,
[14:55] loving, sweet, and kind to one another.
[15:00] Pray for that man that he'll be saved,
[15:02] too.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; Can we do that?
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Remember, he says the enemy will come
[15:08] and when he does, just cling that much
[15:10] closer together.
[15:12] You're going that bond and that one that
[15:14] the devil is using for an enemy will
[15:16] either get out or come in and be one of
[15:19] you.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; Don't make yourself clanish.
[15:23] We are one.
[15:25] I can't say left hand, I'm mad at you.
[15:28] I'm going to take you away because
[15:29] you're not a right hand. He's my left
[15:31] hand. I want him to stay there.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; Even the little tip of my finger, I want
[15:37] to stay right there. Every little part
[15:39] of my body stay right there. And God
[15:42] wants us as a body of believers to stay
[15:45] right exactly
[15:47] with one another. Right with one
[15:50] another.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:52] Because Ephesians 4:3 says, "Endeavoring
[15:55] to keep the unity of the spirit in the
[15:58] bond of peace." Endeavoring is a
[16:01] spiritual union.
[16:04] There is a union between God and his
[16:06] people, between Christ and his members,
[16:09] between the saints, between the saints
[16:12] and the saints.
[16:14] When I first read this, I was like,
[16:16] "What?"
[16:18] But he says God and his people between
[16:21] Christ and his members and between his
[16:23] saints and his saints
[16:25] &gt;&gt; and the bond of each union is love that
[16:29] is which knits and cements them
[16:31] together. The saints are united under
[16:34] one head and are members of one and the
[16:37] same body and should be the same mind
[16:39] and judgment
[16:40] &gt;&gt; and of one accord and heart and
[16:43] affection. This is called the unity of
[16:45] the people. You know, like what happened
[16:47] on the day of Pentecost when it's all in
[16:49] one accord. We we won't go there.
[16:52] In the bond of peace, the Arabic version
[16:55] of this says, "By the bond of love and
[16:57] peace, by maintaining peace among
[16:58] themselves and seeking those things
[17:01] which tend to make for peace, it's
[17:03] called a bond."
[17:07] &gt;&gt; So, we're prisoners of love. That's what
[17:10] brother Christ the mystery got revealed.
[17:12] And see, God himself made himself known
[17:16] and pulsated himself through the life
[17:19] that you're a prisoner to him. Now you
[17:23] are his love prisoner.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; How many love prisoners do we have this
[17:27] morning?
[17:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When you become a
[17:31] prisoner, you become what God wants you
[17:33] to be. It's no longer you.
[17:37] You become that stature of a perfect
[17:38] man. When you're a prisoner of God,
[17:40] you'll do what God wants you to do.
[17:42] You'll walk like him. You'll talk like
[17:44] him. You'll act like him. You'll be him.
[17:46] So, when Paul wrote about being a
[17:48] prisoner of Jesus Christ, he was in
[17:49] prison, chained to a guard, like we
[17:52] mentioned last week.
[17:55] He couldn't go anywhere. You know, some
[17:57] of us are chained to Christ. Some are
[17:59] chained to the devil. Some are refused
[18:01] to be chained. So, if you're refused, we
[18:04] know who what you're chained by. Ain't
[18:06] nobody going to tell me what to do.
[18:08] Bless God.
[18:13] &gt;&gt; You don't know you're chained by the
[18:14] devil already.
[18:16] &gt;&gt; You're like that man in the in the
[18:17] gather rings. He gets chained, but they
[18:19] break the He broke can't breaking the
[18:21] chains. He was so demonpossessed. That
[18:23] should tell you where you're at. If you
[18:24] don't want no chains, but when you're
[18:25] chained, you're harnessed.
[18:28] It doesn't It don't matter to you. You
[18:31] know, when you skydiving, you're getting
[18:33] ready to jump out of a plane. How many
[18:34] skydive in here?
[18:36] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. Nobody.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; When you jump out of a plane, you're
[18:43] harnessed to something.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; When you bungee jumping, you better
[18:48] thank the Lord. You're harnessed to
[18:49] something.
[18:51] It don't matter what you're doing,
[18:52] you're harnessed to it. Paul, brother
[18:55] says in a prisoner, Paul knew what it
[18:57] was. He found out that he was harnessed
[19:00] to something. You know, a horse is a
[19:02] harness is to pull something. But he
[19:04] realized that God had chosen him and
[19:06] hath harnessed him by the Holy Spirit.
[19:09] The experience that he had to pull the
[19:12] gospel to the presence of the Gentiles.
[19:14] The spirit itself harnessed him.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; So today as servants of Christ, we
[19:20] become harnessed, hooked up. We can't go
[19:23] anywhere without it being with us.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. We can't go anywhere
[19:28] without him being with us. We're
[19:30] harnessed to the word. No matter what
[19:32] anyone says, you're harnessed to it.
[19:34] There's something about it that you just
[19:36] can't get away from it. You've been
[19:39] yolked up by the Holy Ghost has yolked
[19:42] you to the word. No matter up, no, no
[19:46] matter what anyone else says, it's the
[19:49] word that's always harnessed up to it.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Put it in the yoke with it. That's the
[19:54] word in the spirit. He was harnessed. So
[19:57] he he says we must come back to the
[19:58] Bible times for this day. They failed to
[20:02] I'll skip that. But
[20:05] that's something else. What a great time
[20:08] Paul. He's talking about he knew that he
[20:10] could not go to places that being
[20:12] harnessed to this that he would not go.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; There's places you can't go when you're
[20:17] harnessed up to Christ.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; When you're hooked up to Christ, you're
[20:21] chained to him only. You'll go where he
[20:23] goes.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; Okay, come on. We're going to church.
[20:27] God makes us go to church. We're going
[20:29] to go. You only look at what he looks
[20:31] at.
[20:33] So when you pick up your phone and
[20:35] you're looking at stuff,
[20:36] &gt;&gt; is that what Christ would look at?
[20:40] &gt;&gt; You only do what he says do. You are
[20:43] harnessed to Jesus Christ.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; So whose prisoner are you?
[20:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
[20:55] I want to read this this scripture or
[20:58] this quote again we just read at the
[20:59] beginning and I like to make this
[21:01] statement
[21:04] that God always has to take any man that
[21:06] will serve him truly to be his prisoner
[21:09] a man has to surrender every ambition
[21:13] &gt;&gt; he's got everything that he is
[21:15] everything his life soul body will be so
[21:20] that's everything
[21:21] &gt;&gt; he ain't leaving anything out and
[21:24] everything else and become a complete
[21:27] prisoner to Christ who is the word
[21:32] to serve God.
[21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
