TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning everyone lord bless you let's stand up happy easter i guess everybody's still uh at home preparing finishing up the last second preparations of food so for this afternoon amen let's pray heavenly father we just come before you now lord and we ask that your holy spirit would be with us speaking to us teaching us lord guiding us into all truth and convicting our hearts of sin lord we just we want you to be glorified and magnified and lifted up this morning we ask in jesus name amen or the markets the other the pride and his prisoners part three that's gonna be my topic this morning continuing on that i'm looking at proverbs 16 verse five and we'll have that up on the screen in a moment everyone that is proud in heart is an abomination to the lord though though hand joined in hand he shall not be unpunished amen may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so pride is a as the prophet said pride such a cursed thing so awful so evil is pride and i want to just address something you know there's as with any word there's multiple different meanings you know you you might say to your child i'm so proud of you today well that's not a bad thing but it can become a bad thing it can become something that's such a such a focus and such a all-consuming thing that it becomes bad um it comes becomes a negative thing but being proud of your child for an accomplishment or for the person that they are that's just that's just fine that's wonderful um i think it was brother brother brad campbell texted me after the part one i did of this he said i'm so proud of your what a good job you did and i had to laugh because of course using a play on words because we have different meanings for different words today the world has tried to redefine the meaning of the word proud and it's almost always a positive statement in this world as christians we understand it's a bad it's it's a negative word it's not something that we want to be around and be involved with because of what we've talked about before of god's attitude towards pride but today they have they're proud of every kind of fetish and evil desire and gay pride and trans pride and this pride and that pride and it's such a strange thing i mean really when you when you think about the reality of it it's it's a strange thing you're you're proud you know in this in this world you're proud of your sin and in fact you're celebrated you know by the left wing world you're literally celebrated and hollywood you can't hardly watch anything even something quote unquote clean coming out of hollywood they're going to have homosexual agenda or transsexual agenda perversion shoved down our throats constantly and so this this pride in sin of course is prophesied woe unto them that call evil good and good evil what is what does our world's media do to a staunch bible-believing christian they hate him the whole the whole mechanism of hollywood and media is aimed with a gun pointed against a committed born-again christian it's a joke it's a joke to them that's that's what it is it's so absurd it's a joke to them and yet we'll have islamophobia addressed and homophobia addressed and all these things addressed in in hollywood and by media and what what is it this is rebellion against god and that's the heart of what pride is pride is rebellion against the almighty and it doesn't matter what form it comes in as we as we're going to read in the unity of the one god in the church i think this is the fourth screen perhaps brother mark brother branham says that's what happens to these meetings when people go forth in revival and and men are just led to an intellectual conception he goes off and joins some church and let it go at that satisfied that's all right there's nothing to all this other nonsense we should not have it bastard says oh that's all that was way back in another age and the first thing you know that devil returns back with seven other devils and he becomes a religious devil then he's really filled then he's got pride and jealousy so again of course that's religious pride the person is not an unbeliever and this is in the religious pride in the realms of denominationalism we don't believe in the power of god moving in the church we don't believe in miracles we don't believe in supernatural we don't believe in divine healing we have all that we want we're baptist or we're presbyterian or we're lutheran all right that's a religious thing it's it seems like the same spirits are trying to get into the message today either it's either as brother jason's been talking about it's either we don't believe in the miracles and things that was for brother branham's ministry or it's that's all we think about that's all we talk about it's not about the word there's a balance we want both we want the power of god moving in our lives and we want all of the all the word speaks to us pride would push us to one way or another pride over what pride over the movement that we're a part of the church we're a part of pride over the pastor that we're following the minister that we're following oh and he has wonderful points and he has a thousand quotes to back up his side both sides have a thousand quotes to back up their side why because it is an aside there's a truth right down the center because both things are true we want the power of god we want the word we don't want to live on emotions but we understand that emotions follow i can't hardly make it through a service here without crying without rejoicing without all the different spectrums of emotions going through me why because i love the lord and it moves me but i don't live based on that i say oh i wasn't emotional therefore i'm not saved no we don't live by that we don't go by that we go by the word and that word brings power cs lewis writes according to christian teachers the essential vice the utmost evil is pride unchastity anger greed drunkenness and all that are mere flea bites in comparison it was through pride that the devil became the devil pride leads to every other vice it is the complete anti-god state of mind it is pride which has been the chief cause of misery in every nation and every family since the world began what a statement i think it bears re repeating i've said it multiple times in each of these messages you have two sides of the of of measurement you have pride and humility pride and humility is a measurement of self just like we talked about the the thermometer not the current thermometers young people you know the old ones that have mercury in it and goes up and down okay so those thermometers as it as it fills up temperature gets hotter that's self filling up that's pride and as it goes down it's emptied out it goes to the bottom goes out that's humility right and so pride we can all be in some different state of that because it's a process of being changed and transformed by the renewing of our mind you know brother branham shows this you can be you can be a religious person and be full of pride you know you've submitted yourself to the word to a certain point but then for the sake of something in your mind you refuse to go any further with god right and that that can be that can be a state even in a person that's born of the spirit of god it's a it's a process of god getting pride out of our lives and we have to submit and surrender that's why paul says i die daily we have to die to ourself every day it's not something that we can do i did it once and it's over with i don't have any pride in my life anymore no it's a continual constant battle and fight waging war against the enemy to be in a position where pride isn't ruling over us because when pride rules over us there's fighting there's there's there's anger there's all these different things that flow out of it so the root the the root of godliness is humility the root of ungodliness is pride romans 12 3 says for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god has dealt to every man the measure of faith it's very interesting when you look at this verse look how many times paul uses the word think or another another way to put it is to be minded so we have to be very careful how we think what kind of thinking we have in our life and this is about ourselves how we think about ourselves is very important that's a whole another message in itself but you you you learn to talk to yourself in a certain way from young ages and it's shaped by the world around you whether it be parents classmates schoolmates and if you're not careful you start to talk use talk to yourself in a way that is putting yourself in a position that's different than what god has put you in we don't have any right to think about ourselves differently than the way god thinks about us you know the scripture says not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think and it goes without saying or more lowly than he ought to think but to think soberly the word sober means to be modest think modestly or you could say balanced think in a balanced way so he uses think think think every three times so if you look at that we have that up on the screen paul is in the in the previous uh go forward again brother mark paul is using sort of a play on words not to be high-minded above what he ought to be minded but so to be minded as to be sober-minded so he sees it's almost impossible to translate what he's doing in the greek language to english but that's probably as good as you can get it we're not to be high-minded we're not to think big things great things above ourselves but we should be minded so that we are thinking of ourselves the way god thinks about us and [Music] anyways who you are what you are is a result of god dealing to you the measure of faith now we have a basic there's two different things we have a basic understanding of ourselves as humans that's been trained to us through through our lives and through our lifetime basic level needs to be transformed by the renewing of our mind so that we think about ourselves the way god thinks about us this the the way we talk about ourselves if someone else did it we'd punch him in the face or a husband would punch someone else in the face of the of their wife if they talk to their wife that way but each of us have a way that we talk to ourselves so negatively and we shouldn't do that because what it hinders us in so many ways in our lives and what is it ultimately it's just it's just pride in a different form it's pro pride and it's you're resisting what god says about you [Music] okay i'll i'll speak on that another time i'm gonna lay that down that'll be the next sunday school think the way god has dealt the measures of grace he's given everybody gifts in the body of christ and he wants us to think the way he thinks about us in testimony brother branham says those arkansas people are poor as they can be but brother under that now i'm going to go into a number of quotes and the purpose of going these quotes is not just to have a lot of information to read but for you to catch god's attitude about pride through the prophet and look at the different circumstances that he identifies uh pride with those arkansas people are poor as they can be but brother under them old blue shirts beat some real good true holy ghost filled hearts yes sir i'd rather have one of them with me any time than maybe a slicker with his collar turned around in the back and i couldn't trust him out of my sight yes indeedy yes indeed just i tell you this old time religion brother it straightens you up that's right it'll make a silk dress and a calico put their arms around one another and call sister is that right it'll make a tuxedo suit and a pair of overalls call each other brother that's what it'll do brother it'll clean you up it'll make no difference in you it tears down that self and starch and pride that we've got amen that's what the holy ghost does it tears down you're not from my group let's let's let's just change the wording up a little bit you're not from my group you're not from my movement in the message oops you don't believe like i do we're going to treat you different wow that's pride it's pride it's self-centered pride protecting your own self your own ideas you'd never thought maybe you're wrong and maybe the person has a point maybe you should pray about what's happening and ask the lord to give you his mind and his glasses and his thought in the unwelcome christ brother branham says this big that big pharisee asked my lord to come and let him set over there with that dung on his feet wouldn't give him any oil let him set their stinking unattended unrefreshed unwelcomed and all of them looking on oh look at him oh god have mercy on the sinful world what a horrible curse pride is oh you're too good sure we got a church that knows better than that we don't believe in divine healing ah we have nothing to do with that pharisee jesus is in your town amen entertain him love him embrace him and love him oh i see him sitting there with head bowed he's usually unwelcome among the rich they got so much of the world they don't have time for jesus great religious orders they don't have time for him so there he sets unwashed feet nobody paying any attention to him you know that kind of spirit still exists oh sure pride it's a cursed thing pride it's an incredible statement it's easy to shovel it off on denominations or somebody else but you know we've come a long way from that place and we're far removed from even this denominational type of thinking and i don't believe god just sets that there he put this in the message and just oh it just leaves there and doesn't have any application to us it's so easy in any movement it doesn't have to be an official denomination to have this attitude of pride in self and looking down on other people it should find no place amongst true believers to look down at people that don't believe like you don't dress like you down don't act like you you understand that you would be just like everyone else unless god came by his grace opened your eyes changed your heart changed your life it took god from the start to the finish it wasn't because of how good you are did he choose jacob because jacob was better a better dude than esau no he chose jacob because he chose jacob he loved jacob because he loved jacob and he loves you because he chose to love you nothing to do with your goodness nothing to do with what you've accomplished nothing to do with your parents the church that you're in the list can go on he didn't choose you for that purpose now he brings the surrounding circumstances in order to accomplish something in your life but that has nothing to do with value god has already established every single person's value when he said we're made in his image and likeness we're to be a reflection of his life and his character and he's made everyone everyone to be that okay so if you look like a human you're designed to be that way now we understand he chose some for eternal life and he chose some for not having eternal life that's scriptural but that's his own choosing and it's nothing to do with the with the va with how good you are it's his love and it's his grace and we have no right to think better of ourselves than other people we we should look at everyone and say that we are their servants and our purpose exists so that they could get saved you pray and pray and pray for revival and when revival gives begins to break out somewhere you say not in my church have nothing to do with that over there oh you actor pride head up in the air hypocrite shame on you just let that sit there let the the holy spirit brood over us i stand at the door and knock brother branham says there's another little door called pride oh what a horrible little black devils is all pinned up in that heart of pride listen to the way the prophet is speaking about this a horrible little black devil is pinned up in a heart of pride thinking you're better than somebody else well i wouldn't send my children over here they don't dress right the people who goes there isn't in my class what a horrible little devil if christ is in your heart we're all one class because of one spirit we're all baptized into one body pride feels just a little a little complex you have oh you don't want jesus to touch that because it would degrade your social standing in the community and the queen of the south brother branham says the same thing was thought when jesus was born in bethlehem they never sang hosanna is when the king was born but the angels sung it not the kings and potentates but the shepherds on the hillsides he wasn't born in a fine decorated hospital room with pink dressings hanging down he was born in a stinking manger how could they ever go to hear a man like that no matter what he done you see what pride and selfishness does it shuts you out from the kingdom of god i wonder sometime as we think what will happen to this generation from the doors inside the door then there's a another little door and that little door is called pride oh that's a hard one to get open you know it's just human beings are just prone to think that maybe they're just a little better than the joneses you know especially here in america you just paint your steps red watch your neighbor paint his red new sister wear just a little certain thing on your hat when you go to church your neighbor just can't stand it in the message to the laodicean church brother branham says now we need to let him in when he comes in worship him and said come in lord be my savior be my god be my ruler be my healer he might be all that i want to know in life be be my lord take everything that i've got lord and rule it take my emotions i will not get ashamed anymore take my pride stand in the door and clothe me lord with your word going to see a revival start then he says stand in my private life lord make me what you'd want me to be let me not take my own thoughts but take yours god lead me o lord he will never take you from the word he will keep you right in his word not because the baptist do it the pentecost do it presbyterian do what got me but because god's word said so you believe it amen amen second timothy 3 1 so speaking of the lat the perilous times in the last days verse 2 says for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away so here we have a powerless religion that's what we end up with but what does it start with all these other attributes of course all time through history if you read this go back to second timothy three verse two all time through history of course we had people that loved their own selves that were covetous boasters proud people did these things verse three verse four all these different things you see that was all through history but paul is telling timothy in the last time there's going to be a concentration of all of this in the church it's a spirit working on religious people in this day that would produce such wickedness and it's a powerless religion that produces that wickedness oh don't you know that there's message people that confess to believe this message but what they're believing is a powerless religion and you cross up them and doctrine one time they'll fight you as hard as they can the love of god won't come out it'll be just a total fight it's a shame behold i stand at the door and knock sermon but i'll but you'll let the devil push every old ungodly thing you can down in that soul and be satisfied with it that's true and right oh don't fool my private life and don't have nothing to do with my little pride you know i got some pride i'm a southerner i am too but brother when we become a christian we lose all of that that's right we must be christ-like in the sermon all the days of our life now we hear so much today about we are free this this quote really struck me we are free oh we live in a beautiful america we are free oh the air is full of it books and a road of it thousands of them but you're a million miles from being free you're not free don't you be deceived by that america is one of the greatest deceived nations and in more bondage than any place i know of they're worse in bondage than communism could put them in communism can only hurt the body they can only put the body in bondage but when the devil comes in he puts the soul in bondage and man is a slave america is a bunch of slaves you may be a slave to pride that was that was so stunning to me looking at that at that quote just to really think this is god's viewpoint about it you're more we're more in bondage in this nation everyone you go on you go on the news and you watch the different fox news cnn all the other alternative news places and what what you see is a deceived world both sides of the coin entirely deceived worse than what communism could total bondage total slavery to sin and wickedness and the main uh promoter of it worldwide i'm proud to be an american or at least i know i'm free okay what does the prophet have to say about that what it takes to over outcome all unbelief our faith and today when the church is sick the sickness is piled up and the people because of intellectual pride and so forth is getting away from divine healing getting away from the holy spirit god still hears the cry of his people somebody's got to go in the sermon the way back and the holy spirit is that leader the one who leads him by still waters and gives him everlasting life when they seen these people lose all their pride they got to dancing in the spirit they got to speaking in tongues four tons of fire flying out of them and here they all come out a bunch of galileans speaking in every language under heaven they didn't know what all this meant those doctors of divinity was really surprised they didn't know what had happened but they had been inoculated you know they got to asking what all this means in other words this the power of god falls and people through pride say i don't want that i don't need that that'll make me look silly we when the power of god falls we just say amen lord whatever you want me to do that's what i want to do get all the starchiness and pride out of me in the pergaman church age i'm closing shortly brother branham says too often when men are signally used of the lord they become lifted up with pride and he says but not so with martin amen and let it not be so with us when we're used of the lord may may we just get more and more humble all right i'm just going to finish with james 4 6. moreover he gives greater grace this is from the west translation he gives greater grace for this reason he says god sets himself in battle array against the arrogant and haughty but gives grace to the humble and lowly amen let's stand and pray gracious father we just come before you now and we're so thankful for your word and your life we asked lord that your holy spirit would just have have your way this morning in the worship and the preaching of the word may you be glorified and lifted up lord help each one of us to get get ourselves out of the way lord and just be under expectation we ask these things in jesus name amen amen we'll dismiss shortly and be back with the song service in a few moments [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you
