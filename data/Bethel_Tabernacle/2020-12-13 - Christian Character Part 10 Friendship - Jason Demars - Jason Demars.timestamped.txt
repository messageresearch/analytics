[0:43] [Music]
[1:33] good morning everyone let's stand up
[1:38] let's pray heavenly father we thank you
[1:42] so much for your mercy and your grace
[1:44] we thank you lord that you have poured
[1:46] your love out upon us lord by the holy
[1:49] ghost and
[1:50] i pray that you would help us to grow
[1:52] more
[1:54] in this love help us to see the reality
[1:57] of what you've called us to in this day
[1:59] as your bride
[2:02] lift our faith to new levels lord new
[2:04] places that has never gone before in
[2:06] this hour
[2:07] we ask it in jesus name amen
[2:10] all right let's look at our opening
[2:12] scripture we continue on christian
[2:14] character part 10
[2:16] looking at friendship continuing to
[2:21] first thessalonians 4 9 and 10.
[2:26] but as touching brotherly love that's
[2:29] philadelphia
[2:30] you need not that i write unto you for
[2:33] ye yourselves are taught of god to
[2:35] love agape one another and indeed you do
[2:39] it toward all the brethren which are in
[2:41] all macedonia but we seek you bret
[2:43] we beseech you brethren that you
[2:46] increase
[2:47] more and more may the lord add the
[2:49] blessing to the reading of his word
[2:51] could be seated so
[2:55] this is paul's beseeching or begging
[2:59] them increase more and more
[3:03] in this philadelphia this brotherly love
[3:07] which god teaches you to walk in by
[3:11] putting his agape love into our hearts
[3:14] again we
[3:14] said it before we love from overflow
[3:19] the love of god is shed abroad in our
[3:21] hearts by the holy ghost so
[3:23] we get filled up with his love and as a
[3:25] result
[3:26] the love spills out on everyone around
[3:30] us
[3:32] and again friendship we're talking about
[3:36] friendship
[3:37] and that really comes from the word
[3:40] filio
[3:41] friend is filos filio is the act of
[3:45] loving as a friend filos is being
[3:49] a friend and so they're so connected
[3:52] together and i think it's very
[3:54] interesting i just as
[3:55] as i've been studying this more and more
[3:58] how
[3:59] significant the relationships we have in
[4:01] our lives
[4:02] and we really don't think of it in in
[4:05] terms and we look back at the scripture
[4:07] how much
[4:08] it speaks about friendship and how
[4:11] important friendship is
[4:15] it's absolutely critical in our lives
[4:19] and you know we've we've said it before
[4:22] but the right kind of friends
[4:26] what it means if you understood what it
[4:27] means to be a friend you'd be so careful
[4:30] about the people that you surround
[4:32] yourself
[4:34] proverbs 27 17 again kind of reviewing
[4:37] it we're going to take a step further
[4:39] um what i want to do ultimately after we
[4:41] do this short review is
[4:43] to look at the friendship of jonathan
[4:46] and david as a real
[4:47] example of what friendship is supposed
[4:50] to be
[4:51] so proverbs 27 verse
[4:54] 17.
[4:58] iron sharpeneth iron so a man
[5:02] sharpeneth the countenance of his friend
[5:06] again sharpening a sword in the ancient
[5:08] world took persistence
[5:10] and careful striking against
[5:13] against itself in order to sharpen it
[5:16] it didn't just take a few seconds it
[5:19] took time
[5:21] and so you look at this proverb it's
[5:24] speaking of the importance of
[5:26] persistence in friendship that we need
[5:29] to give
[5:30] loving constructive
[5:34] correction and criticism to one another
[5:36] to help each other grow but not only
[5:38] that just
[5:39] conversations about godly subjects
[5:42] cause us to grow
[5:46] why because it challenges the way we
[5:48] look at things
[5:50] and we get so sometimes so stuck inside
[5:52] of ourselves
[5:54] that we need to get out we need to have
[5:55] conversations with godly people
[5:58] because immediately god begins to work
[6:00] and bringing revelation and i can't tell
[6:02] you how many times the lord has worked
[6:04] just in personal conversations with
[6:06] people one-on-one not ministers just
[6:09] everyday everyday folks how the lord
[6:12] moves
[6:13] in my life in their life i think that's
[6:16] the
[6:16] almost the biggest way that god works
[6:21] in my own experience wonderful through
[6:23] the pulpit a blessing
[6:25] but god takes those things and really
[6:27] writes it on our heart as we fellowship
[6:29] with one another even just
[6:31] the the discussions that my wife and i
[6:34] have
[6:35] how how much it helps you to grow
[6:38] as you talk about the word together a
[6:41] genuine
[6:42] friend is faithful over time to offer
[6:45] their criticism and instruction
[6:48] and a genuine friend does not give up
[6:50] the first time his friend doesn't take
[6:52] his advice
[6:54] he doesn't get angry he's patient he
[6:57] says that's all right
[6:58] we just keep we keep chipping away we
[7:00] keep sharpening
[7:01] each other and
[7:05] it is it's through that
[7:08] real fellowship real fellowship not just
[7:11] having a bunch of fun together
[7:12] but real fellowship together
[7:16] that were sharpened
[7:19] again something came up to me that i i a
[7:21] point that i didn't
[7:23] bring out as we were fellowshipping
[7:24] after the service
[7:26] that you don't just sharpen your sword
[7:30] one time after you use it you have to
[7:33] come back and sharpen it again
[7:34] in other words it takes continual
[7:37] follow-up
[7:38] to stay continually sharp that's what
[7:41] that's what friendship
[7:42] requires it's not just every once in a
[7:46] while or i
[7:47] we're friends and then i abandon you
[7:50] it's
[7:50] continual friendship continual follow-up
[7:53] continual contact with each other
[7:57] to build each other up
[8:00] proverbs 27 21
[8:03] as the fining pot for silver and the
[8:06] furnace
[8:07] for gold so is a man
[8:10] to his praise it's a very interesting
[8:14] scripture if you really look at it
[8:19] so is a man to his praise in other words
[8:22] you're
[8:22] you're refined
[8:26] by the type of praise that you get
[8:31] i i looked at this and i thought my
[8:33] that's very interesting
[8:35] this is what john gill writes about it
[8:39] uh if he is praised by good and virtuous
[8:42] men
[8:43] he may be thought to be so himself and
[8:45] if by wicked men
[8:47] he may be concluded to be so likewise
[8:51] if it swells him with pride and makes
[8:53] him haughty
[8:54] conceited and overbearing he will appear
[8:56] to be a weak and foolish man
[8:59] but if he continues modest and humble
[9:01] and studious and diligent
[9:03] to answer his character thankful to god
[9:06] for what he has
[9:07] and to whom he gives all the glory he
[9:09] will approve himself as a wise
[9:12] and good man what does that have to do
[9:16] with friendship everything
[9:19] everything because your friends
[9:20] encourage you and build you up
[9:22] towards the right things
[9:25] bad friends build you and encourage you
[9:28] to do the wrong things and and
[9:32] it literally refines you to be
[9:36] what that that praise is is
[9:39] putting out in you to go further think
[9:42] about it in
[9:42] in any relationship we speak life
[9:46] or death with our tongue and we can
[9:48] speak life into those around us
[9:51] or we can speak death into those around
[9:53] us
[9:54] and then for ourselves as we hear that
[9:57] we assimilate that we start speaking the
[9:59] same things
[10:00] back to our own selves and so that
[10:04] shapes then who we are because then we
[10:07] speak the same way
[10:09] we think the same way how critical it is
[10:13] examine who are your friends
[10:16] who are your fellowshipping with because
[10:18] that's going to shape you
[10:20] that's going to create the reality that
[10:22] is you
[10:25] proverbs 18 24
[10:28] a man that hath friends must show
[10:30] himself friendly
[10:32] and there is a friend that sticks closer
[10:34] than a brother
[10:37] adam clark writes on this one love
[10:39] begets love and
[10:40] love requires love as its recompense
[10:44] if a man does not maintain a friendly
[10:47] carriage in other words a friendly uh
[10:50] outward disposition he cannot expect to
[10:53] keep his
[10:53] retain and keep his friends friendship
[10:57] is like a good plant
[10:59] but a friendship is a good plant but it
[11:01] requires
[11:02] cultivation to make it grow
[11:08] you you you realize that if
[11:11] i i've brought this up before but
[11:15] people by their disposition and their
[11:17] demeanor
[11:19] either they'll repel people or they're
[11:21] attract people
[11:23] and if you come to church expecting
[11:26] everyone
[11:27] to take care of you everyone to
[11:31] follow up with you and for like force a
[11:34] friendship down your throat
[11:37] you're going to be very disappointed
[11:39] it's up to you
[11:40] you want friends show yourself friendly
[11:43] be friendly do the things that friends
[11:46] do text each other call each other
[11:50] invite them for coffee invite them to
[11:52] your home and if they don't reciprocate
[11:56] text them call them take them out for
[11:59] coffee and invite them for your home
[12:01] and if you feel frustrated that they're
[12:03] not reciprocating text them
[12:05] call them take them out for coffee
[12:08] invite them to your home
[12:10] just don't you don't give up we don't
[12:13] give up on one another
[12:14] we keep going we keep pursuing we keep
[12:18] loving why because that's what christ
[12:21] does
[12:23] we don't sit with our arms folded angry
[12:25] and frustrated
[12:27] no one is taking care no one is being my
[12:29] friend
[12:30] what verse of scripture is that from
[12:36] what doctrine is that from it's from a
[12:38] false doctrine
[12:40] it's called selfishness
[12:41] self-centeredness but but but the church
[12:43] should be
[12:44] you're the church so you start being
[12:46] what the church should be
[12:48] and you be the example if it isn't the
[12:50] way it should be
[12:51] then you start something you can't wait
[12:54] for other people
[12:56] if god has laid it on your heart why are
[12:59] you looking for someone else to do it
[13:01] you do it you start it you be a
[13:04] difference maker
[13:05] that's what god wants you to be he gave
[13:07] you that insight not to criticize
[13:10] but to pray and do something amen
[13:15] if you if you get an insight about a
[13:17] problem
[13:18] god is not saying would you just
[13:20] complain about that
[13:21] a lot he's giving you an
[13:25] a supernatural insight into something to
[13:28] take action
[13:30] but the people but but but but
[13:36] would you just do what god says to do
[13:39] and leave the results up to him
[13:43] i think probably one of the most
[13:47] beautiful illustrations of
[13:49] friendship is in the bible is david and
[13:51] jonathan
[13:53] um it's just phenomenal i'm gonna do a
[13:56] lot
[13:57] of reading of scripture and a little bit
[14:00] of
[14:00] talking about those scriptures but i
[14:02] want you to see just a living example of
[14:05] friendship
[14:06] first samuel 18 1-4
[14:10] and it came to pass when he had made an
[14:12] end of speaking unto saul now this is
[14:14] after
[14:15] david had killed goliath and shown
[14:17] himself to be a
[14:19] incredibly valiant faithful
[14:23] faith-filled young man
[14:27] all right and it came to pass when he
[14:28] had made an end of speaking unto saul
[14:31] that the soul of jonathan was knit
[14:34] with the soul of david and john jonathan
[14:37] loved him
[14:38] as his own soul two souls
[14:42] knit together i think that's a beautiful
[14:45] description
[14:46] of godly friendship two souls
[14:50] knit together this word knit is the same
[14:53] word that speaks of when rahab
[14:55] tied the scarlet cord outside
[14:59] of her window that the soul of jonathan
[15:02] was
[15:02] tied together
[15:05] with the soul of david
[15:08] and the result of that tying together
[15:11] was that
[15:12] jonathan loved david as his own soul
[15:16] verse two and saul took him that day and
[15:19] would let him go
[15:20] no more home to his father's house then
[15:22] jonathan and david
[15:24] made a covenant because he loved him as
[15:27] his own
[15:27] soul look at jonathan
[15:31] jonathan was in the position of power
[15:33] right
[15:34] jonathan was the son of the king he had
[15:37] all the cards look what jonathan did
[15:42] jonathan stripped himself of the robe
[15:44] that was upon him
[15:45] and gave it to david and his garments
[15:48] even to his sword and to his bow and to
[15:49] his girdle you know that david was
[15:51] already anointed
[15:52] king by samuel by this time
[15:56] what is jonathan doing totally
[15:59] selfless it was him
[16:03] that was being robbed of the kingdom
[16:05] quote unquote
[16:06] by the behavior of his father of course
[16:08] not by david
[16:10] but humanly speaking jonathan
[16:13] had everything to lose by this this
[16:16] fellow right here
[16:18] all his position all his authority
[16:20] absolutely everything
[16:22] was going to be lost to david it didn't
[16:25] impact jonathan
[16:27] he took his sword off he took his bow he
[16:29] took his girdle
[16:30] he took his robe and put it on david
[16:34] that's that's selflessness
[16:37] jonathan not only was selfless but he
[16:39] also
[16:40] this was part of jonathan rejoicing in
[16:43] what god
[16:44] did through david he wasn't jealous
[16:47] he wasn't upset he was like this is a
[16:50] this is a man just like me
[16:53] a valiant man a man that loves god that
[16:56] loves
[16:57] his country that loves his people that
[17:00] will fight
[17:01] to the death for it and he and he puts
[17:03] his faith in god no matter what
[17:06] the circumstances wow i love
[17:09] this and their souls were knit together
[17:13] there was no jealousy
[17:16] there there was just pure rejoicing
[17:20] in the achievement of god through
[17:22] someone else
[17:25] even though it was to jonathan's own
[17:28] personal detriment
[17:30] first samuel 19 1-7 and saul spake to
[17:34] jonathan his son and to all his servants
[17:36] listen that he should kill david
[17:40] that they should kill david
[17:43] but jonathan saul's son delighted much
[17:45] in david
[17:46] and jonathan told david saying saul my
[17:49] father seeks to kill thee now therefore
[17:51] i pray thee take heed to thyself until
[17:54] the morning and abide in a secret place
[17:55] and hide thyself
[17:57] and i will go out and stand beside my
[17:59] father in the field where thou
[18:00] art and i will commune with my father of
[18:03] thee and
[18:04] what i see that i will tell thee and
[18:06] jonathan spake
[18:07] good listen a lot to lose right here
[18:12] in his relationship with his father a
[18:14] lot to lose
[18:16] in fact the person that his father is
[18:18] trying to kill
[18:19] is likely doing it for the very benefit
[18:22] of his own
[18:23] son jonathan and jonathan is
[18:26] personally fighting against the purpose
[18:29] of his father to defend his friend
[18:34] incredible
[18:38] and jonathan spake good of david
[18:41] unto saul his father and said unto him
[18:44] let not the king
[18:45] sin against his servant against david
[18:47] because he has not sinned against thee
[18:49] and because his works have been to thee
[18:51] word very good
[18:53] for he did put his life in hand and slew
[18:55] the philistine
[18:56] and the lord brought a great salvation
[18:58] for all israel
[19:00] thou sawest it and dits rejoice
[19:03] wherefore then will thou sin against
[19:05] innocent blood to slay david without a
[19:07] cause
[19:09] now that's a friend to take a stand for
[19:12] his friend
[19:13] to be loyal
[19:17] at his own co at the cost of his own
[19:20] benefit
[19:22] that is selfless selflessness and saul
[19:25] hearkened
[19:25] unto the voice of jonathan and saul
[19:28] swear as the lord liveth he shall not be
[19:30] slain
[19:31] and jonathan called david and jonathan
[19:33] showed him all those
[19:34] those things and jonathan brought david
[19:37] to saul and he was
[19:38] in in his presence as in times
[19:42] path past the amount of selflessness in
[19:46] this friendship
[19:48] is absolutely stunning to me
[19:52] to think about that and and when we're
[19:54] looking at this is an example
[19:57] friendship true friendship godly
[20:00] friendship
[20:01] requires being selfless
[20:04] requires saying i'm going to seek the
[20:06] good of someone else
[20:07] to my own detriment
[20:11] that's christian friendship i'm going to
[20:14] give of myself
[20:15] until it hurts until it really really
[20:18] hurts until it's really really painful
[20:21] isn't that what jesus said no greater
[20:24] love hath no man than this that he would
[20:25] lay down his life
[20:27] for his friends what did jonathan do
[20:30] time and time again
[20:32] first samuel 20 verse 1
[20:36] and david fled from nyoth and rama and
[20:39] came and said before jonathan
[20:42] what have i done what is my iniquity and
[20:44] what is my sin before thy father that he
[20:46] seeks my life again
[20:48] this is a friend opening his heart up
[20:52] speaking about his difficulties his
[20:54] trials
[20:55] with his friend that's what that's
[20:58] another part
[20:59] important part of friendship being able
[21:01] to share your heart where you're at
[21:03] what you're going through with a friend
[21:06] but that takes trust
[21:08] and trust isn't built in an instant it
[21:10] takes time
[21:13] and he said unto him god forbid thou
[21:16] shalt not die
[21:17] behold my father will do nothing either
[21:19] great or small but
[21:20] he will show it to show it me and why
[21:23] should my father hide this thing from me
[21:24] it is not so
[21:26] and david swear mo moreover and said you
[21:28] know there's a
[21:29] there's a disagreement in a friendship
[21:31] right
[21:34] david's saying he's going to take my
[21:35] life no he wouldn't do that unless he
[21:37] told me
[21:38] and here david comes back your father
[21:40] certainly knows
[21:42] that i have found grace in thine eyes
[21:44] and he saith let not jonathan know this
[21:46] lest he be grieved but truly as the lord
[21:48] liveth
[21:49] and as thy soul liveth there is but a
[21:51] step between
[21:52] me and death so here we
[21:55] see that basically david's saying is
[21:58] your dad doesn't trust you anymore he
[22:02] doesn't trust you because he knows that
[22:03] you're fighting to protect me
[22:05] and this is a shock to jonathan it's
[22:08] shocking
[22:10] no doubt it hurt to hear this but
[22:12] david's speaking the truth to him and
[22:14] and this is what jonathan goes
[22:17] and does then said jonathan unto david
[22:20] whatsoever thy soul
[22:22] desireth i will even do it for thee okay
[22:24] i take your word for it
[22:26] and david said unto jonathan behold
[22:28] tomorrow is the new moon and i should
[22:30] not fail to sit with the king at meat
[22:32] but let me go that i may hide myself in
[22:34] the field unto the third day
[22:36] if thy father at all miss me then say
[22:38] david earnestly asked leave of me that
[22:40] he may run to bethlehem his city
[22:42] for there is a yearly sacrifice there
[22:44] for all the family
[22:45] if he saith us it is well thy servant
[22:47] shall have peace but if
[22:49] he be very wrath then be sure that evil
[22:51] is determined by him
[22:52] therefore thou shalt deal kindly with
[22:55] thy servant
[22:56] for thou has brought thy servant into a
[22:57] covenant of the lord with thee
[22:59] notwithstanding if there be in me
[23:01] iniquity slay me thyself
[23:04] for why should should you bring why
[23:08] should ist thou bring me to thy father
[23:10] and jonathan said
[23:12] far be it from thee for if i knew
[23:13] certainly that evil were determined by
[23:15] my father to come upon thee
[23:17] then would i not tell it thee then said
[23:20] david to jonathan who shall
[23:22] tell who shall tell me or what if thy
[23:23] father answereth thee roughly
[23:25] and jonathan said unto david come and
[23:27] let us go out into the field and they
[23:29] went out both of them into the field
[23:31] and jonathan said unto david o lord god
[23:33] of israel when i have sounded
[23:35] my father about tomorrow any time or the
[23:38] third day and behold if there be good
[23:40] toward david and i then send not unto
[23:43] thee and show it thee
[23:45] the lord do so and much more to jonathan
[23:47] but if it please my father to do the
[23:49] evil
[23:50] then i will show it thee and send thee
[23:51] away that thou mayest go in peace
[23:54] and the lord be with thee as he hath
[23:56] been with my father
[23:57] and thou shalt not only while yet i live
[24:00] show me the kindness of the lord that i
[24:02] die not
[24:02] but also thou shalt not cut off thy
[24:04] kindness from my house forever
[24:07] no not when the lord hath cut off the
[24:09] enemies of david everyone from the face
[24:12] of the earth
[24:13] so jonathan made a covenant with the
[24:14] house of david saying let the lord even
[24:16] require it at the
[24:18] hand of david's enemies and john
[24:20] jonathan caused david to swear again
[24:22] because he loved him for he loved him
[24:26] for he loved him as he loved his own
[24:29] soul that's that's real friendship
[24:33] right there no and if there's any
[24:36] confusion this
[24:37] this seals it up jonathan knew
[24:41] that david was anointed to be the next
[24:43] king jonathan knew
[24:44] he was not going to inherit the kingdom
[24:48] from his father
[24:49] and jonathan said i'm going to stand
[24:51] with my friend
[24:52] david even at my own
[24:56] at my own loss it's incredible and time
[24:59] and time again
[25:00] jonathan has offered easy situations
[25:03] where
[25:04] he could turn david over to his father
[25:07] very easy and he every time refused to
[25:10] do it and not only refused to do it
[25:12] but went to speak to his father
[25:16] on his on david's behalf and so we look
[25:19] further for samuel 20
[25:23] 27 through 42 and it came to pass on
[25:25] tomorrow which was the second day of the
[25:27] month
[25:28] that david's place was empty and saul
[25:30] said unto jonathan his son
[25:31] wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to
[25:33] meet neither yesterday nor today
[25:36] and jonathan answered saul david
[25:38] earnestly asked leave of me to go to
[25:40] bethlehem
[25:42] and he said let me go i pray thee for
[25:44] our family at the sacrifice in the city
[25:46] and my brother he hath commanded me to
[25:48] be there and now if i have found favor
[25:50] in thine eyes let me get away i pray
[25:52] thee and see my brethren
[25:53] therefore he cometh not unto the king's
[25:55] table then
[25:56] saul's anger was kindled against
[25:58] jonathan and he said unto him
[26:00] thou son of the perverse a rebellious
[26:02] woman do not i know that thou
[26:04] has chosen the son of jesse to thine own
[26:06] confusion and unto the confusion of thy
[26:08] mother's nakedness
[26:10] for as long as the son of jesse liveth
[26:12] upon the ground thou shalt not be
[26:13] established nor thy kingdom
[26:15] wherefore now send and fetch him unto me
[26:18] for he shall surely die
[26:20] and jonathan answered saul his father
[26:22] and said unto him wherefore shall he be
[26:25] slain
[26:25] what hath he done and saul cast a
[26:28] javelin at him to smite him
[26:30] whereby jonathan knew that it was
[26:32] determined of his father to slay david
[26:35] so jonathan arose from the table in
[26:37] fierce anger and did eat
[26:39] no meat the second day of the month for
[26:40] he was grieved for david because his
[26:42] father has
[26:43] had done him shame and it came to pass
[26:46] in the morning that jonathan
[26:48] went out into the field at the time
[26:50] appointed with david and a little lad
[26:51] with him and he said unto
[26:53] his lad run find out the arrows which i
[26:55] shoot and as the lad ran he shot an
[26:57] arrow
[26:58] beyond him and now when the lad had come
[27:01] to the place of the era which jonathan
[27:02] had shot jonathan cried after the lad
[27:04] and said
[27:04] is not the arrow beyond thee and
[27:07] jonathan cried after the lad make speed
[27:09] haste stay not and jonathan's lad
[27:12] gathered up the arrows and came to his
[27:13] master but the lad knew not anything
[27:15] only jonathan and david
[27:17] knew the matter and jonathan gave his
[27:18] artillery unto his lad
[27:20] and said unto him go carry them to the
[27:22] city
[27:23] and as soon as the lad was gone david
[27:25] arose out of the place toward the south
[27:28] and fell on his face to the ground and
[27:29] bowed himself three times
[27:31] and they kissed one another and wept one
[27:34] with another until david
[27:36] exceeded and jonathan said to david go
[27:38] in peace for as much as we have
[27:40] sworn both of us in the name of the lord
[27:43] saying the lord be between me
[27:45] and thee in between my seed and thy seed
[27:48] forever and he arose and departed and
[27:50] jonathan
[27:51] went into the city and then 23
[27:54] 16 through 18 and jonathan saul's son
[27:58] arose and went to david into the wood
[28:01] and strengthened his hand in god
[28:05] not beautiful
[28:08] that's real friendship david no doubt
[28:11] being depressed
[28:12] distressed and jonathan being
[28:16] being basically the one that was his
[28:18] father causing the trouble jonathan
[28:20] gets out there and says and goes to
[28:22] encourage him
[28:24] and he said unto him fear not for the
[28:26] hand of saul my father shall not find
[28:28] thee
[28:28] and thou shall be king over israel and i
[28:30] shall be next unto thee
[28:32] and that also saul my father knoweth and
[28:35] they too made a covenant before the lord
[28:37] and a david abode in the wood
[28:39] and jonathan went to his house and then
[28:43] in closing second samuel 1 26
[28:47] and 27 this is after the death
[28:50] of saul and jonathan and this is the
[28:54] psalm that david sang he said i am
[28:58] part part of the psalm that he's saying
[28:59] i am distressed for thee my brother
[29:01] jonathan
[29:02] very pleasant has thou been unto me thy
[29:05] love to me was wonderful
[29:07] that word wonderful is the same word
[29:10] that's used for
[29:11] miracles it was miraculous
[29:14] his love was supernatural is what david
[29:17] is saying
[29:18] passing the love of women
[29:22] how are the mighty fallen and the
[29:24] weapons of war
[29:26] perished that's a friendship
[29:29] right there brothers and sisters and
[29:31] that's the that's what god has called
[29:34] supernaturally endowed us with the
[29:36] spirit of god
[29:37] to be those kind that kind of friend to
[29:40] one another that we would lay down our
[29:42] lives that we would set ourselves
[29:45] aside our own desires our own position
[29:49] our own place in in order that someone
[29:52] else
[29:54] might have it that someone else might be
[29:57] blessed
[29:58] let's stand and pray
[30:04] heavenly father i i feel greatly
[30:07] challenged by these words
[30:10] lord and i see just a their living
[30:13] example
[30:15] in the scriptures of jonathan laying
[30:18] down his life for his friend and how
[30:22] that
[30:24] their hearts were knit together and that
[30:27] he loved him as his own soul
[30:29] lord would you please
[30:33] help us to love that way love one
[30:35] another that way
[30:38] just move by your spirit in our lives
[30:43] set aside lord in us
[30:46] all the hurts and the frustrations of
[30:49] the past that cause us to be
[30:52] too reserved too drawn back
[30:55] through focused on self help us to give
[30:59] out
[31:00] to our own peril we commit ourselves to
[31:03] you
[31:04] we ask it for your glory in the name of
[31:06] jesus christ
[31:07] amen amen god bless you
