[27:39] all right um y'all
[27:42] gideon i had my powerpoint already
[27:43] pulled up did you see it
[27:45] all right let's uh go ahead and turn
[27:47] right to the word
[27:48] um
[27:49] turn to genesis chapter one
[27:52] and you can just go straight to
[27:53] powerpoint we're just going to read one
[27:55] one short verse of scripture here
[28:04] so genesis chapter 1 and verse 26
[28:09] um
[28:10] uh
[28:11] yeah
[28:12] and god said let us make man in our
[28:15] image after our likeness and let them
[28:18] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[28:19] over the fowl of the air and over the
[28:21] cattle and over the earth and over every
[28:23] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[28:25] earth
[28:26] so god created man in his own image
[28:29] god created he him male and female
[28:31] created he them
[28:32] and god blessed them and god said unto
[28:34] them be fruitful and multiply and
[28:36] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[28:38] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[28:40] and over the fowl of the air and over
[28:42] every living thing that moveth upon the
[28:44] earth
[28:45] amen let's have a word of prayer
[28:48] father i come before you this this
[28:50] evening
[28:51] and i ask that you would be with me
[28:53] allow me to step out of the way give me
[28:55] the strength
[28:57] to be open
[28:58] and to be
[28:59] to be clear that i would not have maybe
[29:01] some obstruction to what you would have
[29:03] to say
[29:04] that any any spirit or nerves that i
[29:06] would have that it wouldn't
[29:08] create a an obstruction that you'd be
[29:10] able to speak clearly to the people
[29:12] father
[29:12] that they would be able to take some
[29:14] word from you not of anything that i
[29:15] would be able to to concoct or contrive
[29:18] or or write or put together but it would
[29:21] be that it would be completely
[29:23] made by you to speak to the people that
[29:26] they would hear something from you
[29:27] father that because it is only by your
[29:29] words that we live
[29:30] it's only by your word that we will
[29:33] survive this dark day father
[29:36] i ask these things
[29:38] in the holy and precious name of the
[29:39] lord jesus christ amen y'all can be
[29:41] seated
[29:43] so um i want to
[29:45] as a title i would take the dominion
[29:47] of the seed
[29:48] and um
[29:51] i want to uh oh where's where's my
[29:54] clicker
[30:01] i have the power
[30:03] all right
[30:05] all right um
[30:07] so uh i wanted to this is a familiar uh
[30:10] scripture um if for y'all y'all who um
[30:14] uh were in my sunday school classes
[30:16] about um biology and stuff i know we
[30:18] read some of this so a little bit of
[30:19] this is gonna be recap right at the
[30:20] beginning just because it's been a
[30:21] minute since i did that and maybe some
[30:23] of y'all weren't here for that so
[30:24] um this is genesis chapter 1 verse 11
[30:27] and god said let the earth bring forth
[30:29] grass and her building seed
[30:30] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
[30:32] kind whose seed is in itself upon the
[30:34] earth and it was so and the earth
[30:36] brought forth grass and herb yielding
[30:38] seed after its kind of the tree yielding
[30:40] fruit whose seed was in itself after his
[30:43] kind and god saw that it was good
[30:45] and then verse 21 and god created great
[30:47] whales and every living creature that
[30:49] moveth which the waters brought forth
[30:51] abundantly after their kind and every
[30:53] winged fowl after his kind and god saw
[30:56] that it was good and god blessed them
[30:58] saying be fruitful and multiply and fill
[30:59] the waters
[31:00] in the seas
[31:01] and let fowl multiply in the earth or in
[31:04] the air yeah in the earth
[31:07] excuse me um
[31:08] is uh am i not holding this mic high
[31:10] enough do i need to am i good okay
[31:13] drop my my uh monitors if you wouldn't
[31:16] mind i don't like hearing myself and it
[31:17] weirds me out
[31:18] um
[31:20] so uh and then and then where we um in
[31:23] verse 24 here and it says god said let
[31:24] the earth bring forth the living
[31:25] creatures after his kind cattle and
[31:27] creeping things and beasts of the earth
[31:29] after his kind and it was so and god
[31:30] made the beast of the earth after his
[31:32] kind and cattle after their kind and
[31:33] everything they creeped with upon the
[31:35] earth after his kind and god saw that it
[31:37] was good
[31:38] and god said let us make man in our own
[31:40] image and
[31:42] in our likeness and we'll skip down
[31:43] because we already read this and god
[31:44] blessed them and god said unto them be
[31:46] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[31:48] earth and subdue it and have dominion
[31:50] over the fish of the sea and over the
[31:51] fowl of the air and over every living
[31:53] thing that moveth upon the earth
[31:55] and so
[31:57] we see this progression and and um what
[32:00] there's a couple i would say key
[32:02] principles that i i see in these verses
[32:04] um the first one
[32:06] is this
[32:07] idea that we would might sum up as very
[32:09] simply as every seed bring it forth
[32:10] after its own kind right it's god
[32:12] commanding every type of creature every
[32:14] type of living thing
[32:16] that he has put a a seed
[32:18] an instruction manual inside of it on
[32:20] how to live and how to how its nature
[32:22] should be fulfilled how its nature
[32:24] nature should be expressed what it would
[32:25] look like what it would do what it would
[32:27] act like how it would live and how it
[32:29] would then would also reproduce that
[32:31] seed and multiply that seed
[32:34] and
[32:35] he tells every type of creature every
[32:37] type of living thing to be fruitful and
[32:40] multiply in one way or another right
[32:42] um and so the the the
[32:46] the um
[32:47] the sort of the the driving force
[32:50] behind all of nature is the sort of the
[32:52] replication of the seed
[32:54] okay
[32:55] and so um
[32:58] so the the
[32:59] the
[33:01] uh
[33:02] what you know we talked about with the
[33:04] with the seed inside of us that you know
[33:05] it sort of controls the nature that that
[33:08] you know if you get off that seed then
[33:10] you get mutations you get cancer you get
[33:11] all sorts of diseases uh like viral
[33:13] infections are are actually a hijacking
[33:15] of the seed expression systems once
[33:17] inside of people and it's the
[33:19] introduction of what we would think of
[33:20] is like a seed of discrepancy
[33:22] um
[33:23] and so it's all back to expressing that
[33:25] seed in the way that god intended it to
[33:27] be expressed okay if you get off of that
[33:30] then you're going to have major problems
[33:31] right the creature won't live and
[33:33] likewise the cri in the in the body of
[33:35] christ if if people get off of off of
[33:37] the word the seed word that god put
[33:39] inside of us you're gonna end up with
[33:41] all sorts of mutations all sorts of all
[33:43] sorts of catastrophe and it's gonna be a
[33:45] huge problem
[33:46] right cancer and everything else you
[33:48] know spiritual cancer you know people uh
[33:52] you know we might have talked about this
[33:53] before but really what cancer is is is a
[33:55] particular kind of cell oftentimes
[33:57] reading bits of the dna that it wasn't
[33:59] intended to actually fulfill
[34:02] right this is where you get you know
[34:04] somebody uh
[34:06] taking scriptures that doesn't apply to
[34:08] them
[34:09] you know it's all part of the word but
[34:11] it doesn't really apply to you and
[34:12] trying to fulfill something that god
[34:13] never called them to right and then you
[34:15] end up you know with a liver cell trying
[34:16] to be a pancreas cell or an eye cell
[34:19] well you don't want an eyeball in your
[34:20] liver things go badly if that happens
[34:22] um
[34:23] right
[34:24] um
[34:26] and you also don't want a liver in your
[34:27] eyeball that's also a problem
[34:29] the um
[34:31] but you know and so you see how when
[34:32] people get out of their order get out of
[34:34] out of place
[34:35] it causes a bunch of chaos and
[34:36] destruction
[34:38] and so
[34:39] one of the things that that struck me
[34:41] that i struggled with a lot you know i
[34:42] had a background in biology and and sort
[34:44] of pre-medical science and stuff and
[34:47] especially as a new christian one of the
[34:48] things that i really struggled with was
[34:49] how is it
[34:51] that
[34:52] you know
[34:53] i know that you know that maybe the
[34:54] theory of evolution is wrong but all of
[34:57] medicine all of biology is based on it
[34:59] right i mean they no you don't go into
[35:00] the medical field without
[35:02] it just sort of being assumed that
[35:04] that's how everything came to be and yet
[35:06] there's so much of biology that isn't
[35:09] wrong
[35:10] right in the small scale like it's it's
[35:12] actually true and they get a lot of
[35:14] mileage out of that theory of evolution
[35:15] yet somehow it's wrong
[35:17] right
[35:18] and so it i struggled with this
[35:21] until you know i was it just never made
[35:23] sense to me and so i was reading through
[35:25] this and it occurred to me
[35:27] um
[35:29] uh so
[35:30] on this first bullet you know one of the
[35:31] key principles here is we call the
[35:32] central dogma of biology that's the
[35:34] phrase that the medical or the
[35:36] scientific world uses for this idea that
[35:39] every genetic code every set of dna
[35:42] reproduces itself
[35:44] right
[35:45] the central dogma of biology is just a
[35:47] sort of scientific medical phrase for
[35:50] every scene breaks brings forth after
[35:51] its own kind
[35:53] right
[35:54] and so
[35:55] the reason it's the central dogma of
[35:56] biology is because it's also the thing
[35:58] that kind of props up the theory of
[35:59] evolution
[36:00] right
[36:01] the
[36:02] and so really what the theory of
[36:03] evolution did is the reason they get so
[36:05] much mileage out of it is because it
[36:07] actually has biblical principles in it
[36:09] but they try to snip god out of the
[36:11] picture
[36:12] right they took a a razor blade and cut
[36:14] got out of the picture and then
[36:17] so they do get some truth out of the
[36:19] deal right they can get a certain
[36:21] measure of truth but it's never going to
[36:22] be
[36:23] they're going to struggle right
[36:25] and so
[36:26] what we see um
[36:29] you know in this sort of this idea that
[36:32] um
[36:33] part of this you know central dogma of
[36:35] biology and you know uh that that every
[36:37] creature has this drive to sort of
[36:38] reproduce the seed
[36:40] is we get some
[36:42] it once you think of it in that
[36:43] perspective that every creature is
[36:45] their goal and motivation is to
[36:47] reproduce their the seed that god put
[36:49] inside of them and fulfill that first
[36:51] commandment you know god did not command
[36:53] all creatures all of nature to live a
[36:56] long and happy life
[36:57] he said be fruitful and multiply
[37:00] right like it's
[37:01] you know sort of implicit in that is
[37:03] maybe live a long and happy life you
[37:04] can't really be fruitful multiply if
[37:06] you're dead um but
[37:09] the
[37:11] the actual command there was to really
[37:13] reproduce
[37:14] you know let that seed manifest and not
[37:17] just stay with you but to express out
[37:19] into the world
[37:21] and because of this once you think of it
[37:23] in this in this context a lot of stuff
[37:25] in nature starts to make sense it
[37:26] doesn't really make a whole lot of sense
[37:28] right so for instance you take something
[37:31] like um a peacock
[37:33] doesn't make a whole lot of sense if
[37:35] you're trying to live a long and happy
[37:36] life because he's got all this giant
[37:38] plumage that requires a bunch of he's
[37:40] going to eat a lot of food to grow these
[37:41] giant feathers it gets stuff caught in
[37:43] it so he's got to groom it all the time
[37:45] it's a giant thing that predators can
[37:46] snatch and eat you know eat the bird
[37:49] with and he tries to fly away and he's
[37:50] got a parachute behind him right like
[37:53] it's it's a it's a real problem
[37:55] why would he do this well it's because
[37:57] if he doesn't have those that plumage
[37:59] he's gonna you know kind of sidle up to
[38:01] that that pee hand and be like how's it
[38:03] going and she's gonna be like well you
[38:04] are the ugliest woman i've ever seen and
[38:07] you know and and the he's he's
[38:10] doesn't stand a chance right and this is
[38:12] this is
[38:14] his purpose is not gonna be fulfilled
[38:16] there
[38:17] right that that command that he has
[38:19] that's that's driving him his purpose of
[38:22] being
[38:23] can never be fulfilled without that so
[38:25] it's it's
[38:26] if he lived to be a hundred years old
[38:28] without that plumage he might live to be
[38:30] a hundred years old but he's not going
[38:32] to fulfill his purpose
[38:34] right
[38:35] and
[38:36] likewise we get i mean you get all kinds
[38:38] of crazy stuff you know
[38:39] things like lions kill each other over
[38:42] over you know control over over mating
[38:44] rights i mean if you're if you're trying
[38:47] to live a long time don't get into the
[38:48] conflict you don't want to die right
[38:50] right but because it's important to you
[38:52] the the right um you see this a lot in
[38:55] the insect world
[38:56] bug and insects the males get their
[38:58] heads ripped off and eaten
[39:00] that doesn't make any sense at all
[39:03] right
[39:03] if my purpose was survival
[39:06] i'm not going anywhere near that
[39:09] but my purpose isn't survival
[39:13] it's fulfilling
[39:14] the drive that god put in me to
[39:17] reproduce the seed
[39:19] and this is
[39:20] where you know i i in a phrase the
[39:23] purpose of the creature is not the
[39:24] creature
[39:25] rather the purpose of the creature is
[39:27] the seed
[39:29] okay
[39:30] what's really the life here
[39:33] is it me with my thoughts and ideas and
[39:35] whatever or is the seed inside of me
[39:37] that's actually controlling all that
[39:39] right
[39:40] is it this flesh guy or is this flesh
[39:42] guy just sort of a meat robot that the
[39:44] seed is driving around in order to
[39:45] fulfill the purpose that god put in it
[39:47] right
[39:49] like what's what's really happening here
[39:51] who's whose life is really here
[39:55] right
[39:57] and
[39:58] i'm gonna take a drink of water here
[40:09] and um so there's another moving on
[40:11] there's another thing here is that
[40:14] um unfortunately i didn't
[40:16] have time to put it in my notes or in my
[40:18] powerpoint here but um
[40:20] brother branham says several times
[40:21] throughout the message he talks about
[40:22] it's just as an allegory you know um god
[40:25] you know the fish has a fit on his back
[40:26] because there was a water if there
[40:28] wasn't a water firm to swim in then he
[40:29] never would have a fin on his back there
[40:31] had to be an earth for the tree to grow
[40:32] in before there could have been a tree
[40:34] things like this
[40:35] um and so
[40:37] it's this notion and you see it in in
[40:39] genesis in as it progresses you know god
[40:41] makes the earth and he you know
[40:43] separates the waters from the land
[40:44] before he plants the trees and then once
[40:46] the trees are planted then
[40:48] you know the fowls of the air and things
[40:49] like that can grow there had to be
[40:51] oceans that separated before the fish
[40:52] could grow in there excuse me there had
[40:54] to be plants
[40:55] and herb yielding seed and fruit-bearing
[40:57] trees
[40:58] existed before
[41:00] the beasts of the field could come along
[41:01] to eat them you know like there has to
[41:03] be this environment set up before
[41:05] the creatures can really live in it
[41:07] and um
[41:09] it's showing that every creature is sort
[41:11] of a model after its environment
[41:13] right you you you're you're fit you're
[41:16] built to live in a certain kind of
[41:18] environment amen
[41:20] which
[41:22] um
[41:23] sort of by extension
[41:26] you would say
[41:27] if the life
[41:29] if the real purpose of the creature was
[41:31] a life living inside of it
[41:33] then you are the environment that god
[41:35] built to live in
[41:36] there had to be a you before there could
[41:38] be a god in you
[41:39] right
[41:40] and so
[41:42] but but going at this um
[41:44] uh
[41:45] yeah creatures are modeled after
[41:46] environment so we see pictures like this
[41:49] right
[41:50] um the little desert lizard there uh the
[41:52] horn toad there's our cool little
[41:54] critters all over the southwest got the
[41:56] leaf bug there in the corner and then i
[41:58] really like that picture of the snow
[41:59] hair because it's kind of in the middle
[42:01] you know kind of transition right these
[42:03] are all creatures that you don't really
[42:05] necessarily need to see their
[42:06] environment to know what they are you
[42:08] you know what their environment looks
[42:09] like without having to actually see the
[42:10] environment you could just see the
[42:11] creature and know what it looks like
[42:13] right
[42:14] likewise um people
[42:17] you can look at people and you can see
[42:18] the things that they're expressing the
[42:19] things they do and the way they act and
[42:21] you can see the environment that they've
[42:22] built for themselves you don't have to
[42:25] know anything about it
[42:26] right
[42:28] you know i've heard you know brother
[42:29] burley's i remember when being young and
[42:31] he he made this this point you have you
[42:34] see a little girl
[42:35] and
[42:36] she's got um she's got her baby doll and
[42:39] she's beating the tar out of that baby
[42:41] doll telling it how wretched it is
[42:43] right
[42:45] she saw that somewhere right the
[42:48] something happened that caused that i i
[42:51] the environment that i work in i see
[42:53] this all the time
[42:54] um i you know work with a lot of people
[42:58] who have a lot of broken homes and it's
[43:00] you see that the
[43:01] i can look at somebody's kids and know
[43:03] the way they treat those kids and the
[43:04] way they act around those kids you know
[43:07] you got an eight-year-old kid
[43:09] that has a vocabulary that'll make a
[43:10] marine blush
[43:13] and then you're like what in the world
[43:16] how did
[43:17] you can't even spell yet like
[43:20] how do you know what any of this is and
[43:23] then you go into the home and you hear
[43:25] the mom screaming at her kids
[43:28] using that kind of language like okay
[43:30] right the the environment that you build
[43:33] around yourself those kids are a model
[43:35] of the environment that they were put in
[43:37] right
[43:38] likewise parents if you see something
[43:40] that your kids are doing that you really
[43:42] don't like
[43:44] just consider and i know there's that
[43:46] whole thing of like
[43:47] well number one the guy who doesn't have
[43:49] any kids telling parents how to raise
[43:50] their kids and two
[43:51] um
[43:53] two also god was like how are you gonna
[43:55] say that god wasn't a good parent and
[43:57] his kids rebelled too i get it the point
[43:59] you know teenagers especially like to
[44:01] rebel but also seriously you know you
[44:03] you
[44:05] do not just throw your kids into the bus
[44:06] and just say they're rebellious
[44:07] teenagers
[44:08] i mean you ultimately are sort of
[44:11] responsible for the environment
[44:13] and um
[44:15] but yeah so we look at at people here
[44:17] and so we see guys like this right it's
[44:19] a picture of some guys and we can see
[44:20] this is pretty obvious what they do
[44:22] right they're they're construction
[44:23] workers it's you didn't wouldn't have to
[44:25] see them on the job site you could just
[44:26] see them with their hats and their their
[44:28] high visibility vests and their you know
[44:31] muddy boots and you would know their
[44:32] purpose you would know what their goals
[44:34] in life are you know a whole lot about
[44:37] them just by their outfit right
[44:40] you got this guy it's pretty clear what
[44:42] this guy does
[44:43] right
[44:44] pretty obvious you don't need to know a
[44:46] whole lot of you don't even you can't
[44:47] even see really an environment in this
[44:48] picture yet you know what kind of
[44:50] environment he's expecting to be in
[44:52] right he's a
[44:54] soldier
[44:55] right here's this guy he's got his nice
[44:59] vote for me smile and his vote for me
[45:01] button he's a criminal like this is
[45:04] this is
[45:06] um
[45:07] right i mean you know a lot about these
[45:09] people's environment based on the way
[45:10] they dress and their purposes and their
[45:12] motivations in life
[45:14] you know these guys are building stuff
[45:15] this guy i mean so look so just
[45:18] something that i noticed he's got night
[45:20] vision on his helmet
[45:21] what does this tell you about what kind
[45:23] of battle he's looking to fight
[45:24] right you know you can tell the way
[45:26] people people behave
[45:28] you know um the other thing that stuck
[45:30] out to me is not only he's a soldier
[45:32] he's a modern soldier
[45:33] he's looking to fight a fight a
[45:35] cutting-edge war
[45:37] not he's not dragging some outdated
[45:40] technology to go fight his battles
[45:42] right
[45:43] how many christians are walking around
[45:45] with their whole armor of god outdated
[45:48] technology they're dragging some wooden
[45:50] shield of faith out of luther's day to
[45:52] fight the devil
[45:54] and he's not throwing fiery darts
[45:56] anymore
[45:57] he's got armor-piercing round you know
[45:59] armor-piercing incendiary rounds right
[46:01] he's gonna blow right through that
[46:03] like you you better be carrying some you
[46:05] know level four titanium reinforced
[46:08] ballistic shield of rapturing faith or
[46:10] you're done
[46:12] right
[46:13] like it's it's over
[46:15] amen
[46:17] you know
[46:18] and and furthermore you know uh
[46:22] when brother berry was here he did the
[46:23] the men's um breakfast and he talked
[46:25] about
[46:26] how god will test you you know with the
[46:28] for those men that were there the with
[46:29] the bicycle tire you know
[46:31] he patched it and put the air in it and
[46:33] you you find the leak then you patch it
[46:34] and you test it again after it's been
[46:36] repaired to ensure
[46:37] that the repair stuck
[46:40] and
[46:41] when he said that it recalled to me a
[46:43] sermon that my dad preached many years
[46:45] ago about the acid test right
[46:48] about how when you're testing gold you
[46:50] put a mark you test take the piece of
[46:52] gold and you put acid on it and the
[46:54] different grades of acid
[46:56] if that gold breaks down under a certain
[46:59] grade of acid you know what kind of gold
[47:01] like how pure that gold is you know is
[47:03] it you know 12 14 18 karat 24 karat gold
[47:06] right
[47:07] um and so he makes this he made this
[47:09] statement and always stuck with me and
[47:11] he says look
[47:12] why is it that god puts people
[47:16] to the test if god knows everything
[47:19] right because it's not he knows whether
[47:21] you're going to pass or fail it's not
[47:22] for god to know it's so that you can
[47:24] know
[47:25] right it's so you can know it's so that
[47:27] when you encounter some it's god is
[47:30] letting you know hey you thought you
[47:32] were at a certain level
[47:34] and maybe you didn't quite make it so
[47:36] you need to you need to fix your patch
[47:38] and go back into the tank
[47:40] okay
[47:41] or alternatively is to let you have
[47:44] faith in the power of god to grow you as
[47:46] a christian
[47:47] right it's and so often times you
[47:50] know as christians look in the mirror of
[47:53] god's word
[47:55] everybody thinks that they know
[47:56] themselves so much but you don't know
[47:58] what you look like because you can't see
[48:00] your own face
[48:02] right
[48:03] nobody can look at their own face
[48:04] without a mirror look in the mirror of
[48:06] god's word and it'll tell you what you
[48:08] actually look like and it'll tell you if
[48:09] you're dragging some outdated technology
[48:11] out it'll tell you if you're if your kit
[48:14] if your your gear is not in line if it's
[48:17] not up to snuff
[48:18] because you want to check it with the
[48:20] mirror of the word before you check it
[48:21] on the battlefield
[48:23] right
[48:24] so
[48:26] um and this guy's just a crook um
[48:28] so um i wanted to
[48:31] kind of
[48:32] tell a little story here
[48:35] um
[48:39] i i
[48:40] one of the things that that stuck out to
[48:42] me
[48:43] um that i learned about is uh pigs um
[48:47] everybody kind of knows if i you know
[48:49] say what a pig look you ask you to think
[48:50] of a pig you look a sing from something
[48:52] like this kind of a pink
[48:54] little creature that is kind of fat and
[48:56] oinks and has questionable building
[48:58] practices and a long-standing blood feud
[48:59] with a big bad wolf right like this
[49:02] isn't he's he's a particular kind of
[49:04] thing and he has a particular kind of
[49:06] attitude
[49:07] however
[49:09] god didn't really invent that creature
[49:12] right
[49:12] um god invented that creature okay these
[49:17] two creatures are genetically identical
[49:19] the seed inside of them is the same
[49:22] okay
[49:23] the difference
[49:25] is that the one on the left
[49:27] has been run through thousands of years
[49:30] of domestication
[49:31] that there was a man-made system farming
[49:33] industrial system that came into place
[49:35] that said
[49:36] this creature on the right
[49:38] which by the way is just to make a point
[49:40] here
[49:42] nobody's scared of the guy on the on the
[49:43] left right
[49:44] he's he's docile he's
[49:46] he's not scary the guy on the right will
[49:49] kill you
[49:50] okay
[49:51] pigs are kind of a joke now they weren't
[49:53] a joke a couple thousand years ago um
[49:56] i mean it was typical typically you find
[49:59] in archaeological sites you find
[50:01] iconography of a wild boar as associated
[50:04] with like the most powerful and crazy
[50:06] warriors like you would think of like a
[50:08] dragon or a snake or a tiger or
[50:10] something like that um i once heard a
[50:13] story i mean i don't know it's a hunting
[50:15] tale through a couple different peoples
[50:16] who knows if it's true but um the it was
[50:19] a story about a guy some old farmer in
[50:21] arkansas who was hunting um had some
[50:24] giant like
[50:26] razorback up in the arkansas hills
[50:29] up on his farm and he was trying to hunt
[50:31] this thing down and eventually when he
[50:32] got it cornered up in its lair
[50:35] um
[50:36] is this enormous bore
[50:38] and when it was all said and done that
[50:40] boar killed 19 dogs and three horses in
[50:42] one go
[50:44] okay by himself
[50:46] these creatures are nothing to mess with
[50:49] but yet
[50:51] and when i look at this i fear i feel
[50:54] like
[50:57] how has
[50:59] the man-made system this this sort of
[51:01] farming
[51:02] industry complex that has cropped up
[51:04] across the world has taken this
[51:07] undominable warrior creature and turned
[51:10] it into a bacon machine
[51:12] right that no one is afraid of and it's
[51:16] it's because
[51:17] we put them in a pin
[51:19] and we feed them sweet corn and they
[51:21] don't have to work and they just lay in
[51:23] their pen in their slop and they don't
[51:25] have to do anything they don't have to
[51:26] fight there's no big bad wolves coming
[51:28] for them
[51:29] and it's easy
[51:31] and it's soft
[51:32] and it's relaxing
[51:34] and there's lots of carnal entertainment
[51:36] to feed on
[51:38] and
[51:40] you know um this creature that this
[51:42] warrior beast of faith that britain
[51:44] brother bram talked about faith with
[51:46] muscles and hair on its chest
[51:48] is gone
[51:49] it's been completely crushed
[51:52] they both have the same seed that guy on
[51:54] the on the left
[51:56] he's got everything within him to be
[51:58] this warrior beast
[52:01] and he's not because his outside has
[52:03] been completely conformed
[52:06] to
[52:08] the man-made system
[52:10] right
[52:11] to the to the man-made purpose
[52:15] god had a purpose for him but man had a
[52:17] purpose for him too the devil had a
[52:19] purpose for him too and the devil
[52:21] conformed his flesh man into something
[52:24] completely out of line with the seed
[52:26] within him
[52:27] okay
[52:29] and um
[52:31] and you know
[52:33] so and it took i mean granted it took
[52:34] thousands of years right for thousands
[52:36] of years to do that
[52:38] but over time it happens and by now
[52:42] we who were born in laodicea were born
[52:45] little pink pigs
[52:47] right we're born that way we'll grow up
[52:49] that way
[52:50] we will
[52:51] die that way and our kids will be that
[52:53] way
[52:54] and that's it right that's just
[52:57] there's nothing else that they have to
[52:58] do as long as they keep them in the
[52:59] right environment they will continue to
[53:01] reproduce
[53:03] even though their seed doesn't dictate
[53:05] this they will continue to reproduce in
[53:08] the form that the devil intended for
[53:10] them
[53:11] okay so
[53:13] i
[53:14] when i
[53:15] this was in my mind and i
[53:17] i decided that i wanted to tell a a
[53:19] story um if my clicker will decide to oh
[53:22] there we go i had katie draw this for me
[53:24] um i'm gonna tell you the story of the
[53:25] two little pigs um so i have in my i had
[53:29] in my mind like this this this image
[53:31] like a parable maybe
[53:33] of this
[53:34] these two pigs right and they grow up on
[53:36] a farm the farm is called laodicea
[53:38] and they're little pink pigs and they
[53:39] grow up and they they live on this farm
[53:42] and every day they go out another pig
[53:43] pen and they eat their carnal
[53:45] entertainment brand pig feed and sweet
[53:48] corn and they live in their you know
[53:50] laodicea environment and you know farmer
[53:52] lucifer keeps them well in line and
[53:54] growing them up to be
[53:56] to serve the purpose of lucifer and the
[53:59] and the laodicean farm
[54:01] and um
[54:04] we'll call
[54:06] i don't know one of them will be named
[54:07] peter and the other one will be named
[54:09] napoleon because
[54:11] why not um
[54:13] so
[54:14] uh peter and napoleon are going along
[54:16] living their lives
[54:17] and um
[54:19] one day peter's like you know um
[54:22] i don't i don't know why but
[54:24] i really feel like this is wrong
[54:27] something about the system feels wrong
[54:30] like there's something on my insides
[54:32] that doesn't really align with this
[54:35] i can't put my little paw on it
[54:37] but i can tell
[54:39] that there's something this is like a
[54:41] hatred for this like a rage inside of me
[54:43] that wants to
[54:45] kick get rid of this get away from this
[54:48] because
[54:49] i just feel and i and i know that there
[54:51] used to be a time
[54:52] when
[54:53] christians didn't behave this way
[54:56] christians didn't live in this kind of a
[54:57] system right we were built
[55:00] for something different
[55:02] we were built for a different kind of
[55:03] environment a system that wasn't so
[55:06] civilized didn't have a bunch of
[55:08] civilization and technology and we have
[55:10] a nice nice a lot of luxury to live in
[55:13] and it's nice but man it really doesn't
[55:15] seem like it's produced
[55:17] something in line with what we were
[55:19] built to be
[55:20] and napoleon's like
[55:22] whatever dude just eat your food
[55:24] right like whatever like what are you
[55:26] complaining about we have
[55:28] so many nice things are do you really
[55:29] want to revert back to the stone age you
[55:31] know like is that really what you're
[55:33] wanting
[55:34] you know like what are you trying to be
[55:35] amish
[55:36] and the and he's just like no i just
[55:38] feel like this is wrong and so they you
[55:40] know they go on
[55:41] well one day they're just eating their
[55:43] feet and and they're they look over the
[55:45] fence
[55:46] and to their shock in amazement there's
[55:48] another pig out there
[55:50] and this pig doesn't look like they do
[55:53] this pig is all hairy
[55:55] and he's got tusks
[55:57] and it's
[55:58] kind of pretty in a weird sort of way
[56:01] and
[56:03] he's like
[56:04] wow i didn't know girl pigs could look
[56:05] like that anymore
[56:07] and there's something about this and and
[56:10] napoleon's like dude
[56:11] she's they're they're weird they're like
[56:13] in a cult don't look at them right like
[56:16] they're just weirdos they live some sort
[56:18] of old-fashioned pig lifestyle
[56:20] um
[56:21] you don't want any part of that right
[56:22] they're gonna you're gonna you're gonna
[56:23] end up in like a cabin in the woods and
[56:25] it's just gonna be horrible
[56:27] and the and he's like yeah i know but
[56:30] whatever's inside of me says that's
[56:32] right
[56:33] right there's something said inside of
[56:34] me that says that was more what we were
[56:36] intended to live as
[56:38] and i can't feel fulfilled doing what
[56:41] i'm doing every day
[56:43] this lifestyle that i've built where we
[56:45] just kind of play fast and loose with
[56:47] morality and and sort of just treat
[56:50] people any old way
[56:51] doesn't really click with me because
[56:53] there's something wrong about it i don't
[56:54] know why but i just can't doesn't feel
[56:57] right to me and it's just sort and he's
[56:59] like
[57:00] napoleon's like my brother my precious
[57:02] sweet brother
[57:03] do not get caught up in a cult i don't
[57:04] want to have to go after you
[57:06] just
[57:07] just just don't
[57:09] just don't think about it he's like i
[57:10] can't i can't not a couple days later
[57:13] peter
[57:14] just can't take it anymore and he makes
[57:16] a run for it and he runs off into the
[57:18] woods
[57:19] and napoleon's like oh no they got him
[57:21] right my poor
[57:23] sweet brother has been
[57:25] brainwashed
[57:28] he's been brainwashed by this cult and
[57:30] who knows what's gonna happen he's gonna
[57:31] get eaten by wolves and it's terrible i
[57:34] am here in this farm perfectly safe
[57:37] a couple weeks later there's his brother
[57:41] he sees him
[57:42] peter come over here
[57:44] dude where did you go what happened to
[57:45] you why did you disappear everybody's
[57:48] been worried sick about you you know
[57:50] it's such luxury why do you live the way
[57:52] that you do
[57:53] you know
[57:56] everything's so prosperous over here you
[57:58] know if you're playing
[58:00] you know edging the line of what's
[58:02] morally right in your business you know
[58:03] you have a lot of luxury i have a nice
[58:05] barn to live in and a prosperous
[58:07] lifestyle because i don't care if my
[58:08] wife raises her kids in the in the godly
[58:10] calling that she god gave her in the
[58:12] bible and we just sort of let the but
[58:14] the world and the system raise our kids
[58:16] to become just like we were born you
[58:19] know we don't we don't worry so much
[58:21] about what
[58:22] you know and so it gives us a lot more
[58:24] money we can go on a lot more vacations
[58:26] because we have a two-income household
[58:28] see you're so worried about
[58:30] just some archaic notion that you know a
[58:32] nuclear family should
[58:33] be in line with the bible and that the
[58:35] mother should raise the children and so
[58:38] now
[58:39] you know um
[58:40] you're struggling financially and having
[58:42] to you know scrape around in the dirt
[58:44] whereas we have this nice you know we
[58:46] have this delicious corn this delicious
[58:48] carnal entertainment brand sweet corn
[58:50] pig feed
[58:51] you know it's delicious it's wonderful
[58:53] and you're telling me that you don't
[58:54] want to eat it isn't it wonderful isn't
[58:55] it delicious don't you like it
[58:57] right and peter's like
[59:00] look
[59:02] i think there's you're you're missing
[59:04] something here okay
[59:06] i think there's some there's parts of
[59:08] this
[59:09] that you're really not
[59:11] understanding my brother napoleon you're
[59:13] living on this farm but i think there's
[59:15] more to that than you really you really
[59:16] know and
[59:19] napoleon's like forget about it
[59:21] everybody loves me here we have a great
[59:22] society the cows and the chickens and
[59:24] the dogs and everybody loves me just the
[59:26] other day i went to the county fair and
[59:28] they put a big blue ribbon around my
[59:29] neck i have social i have social
[59:32] acceptance i'm i'm i'm first prize
[59:35] everybody loves me
[59:37] and peter's like
[59:40] did it ever occur to you that that blue
[59:41] ribbon has some implications that you're
[59:43] not considering
[59:46] right
[59:48] the fact that the farmer really likes
[59:50] you
[59:51] might have some implications that you're
[59:52] not considering the fact that laodicea
[59:55] and all of society really likes you
[59:57] might have some implications that you're
[59:59] not considering
[1:00:01] right
[1:00:02] this society that openly declares hatred
[1:00:05] of god and is built by satan to hate god
[1:00:09] if they really like you there are some
[1:00:12] implications to that that you are not
[1:00:14] considering
[1:00:16] right
[1:00:20] and peter says brother napoleon
[1:00:23] you see i've come out of that system
[1:00:26] and i'm looking at it from the outside
[1:00:29] that system keeps you
[1:00:31] in a nice pretty pen and it's clean and
[1:00:33] there's a lot of luxury in it and it's
[1:00:35] soft and it's easy and it's nice and
[1:00:36] it's pretty comfortable and there's not
[1:00:38] a lot of
[1:00:40] hardship that goes with that and yes
[1:00:42] it's very nice
[1:00:43] but i can see the other side of the barn
[1:00:45] and you can't
[1:00:46] and the other side of the barn is a
[1:00:48] slaughterhouse
[1:00:50] right
[1:00:51] right
[1:00:53] the chickens give eggs the cows give
[1:00:55] milk what do the pigs give the farmer do
[1:00:58] you really think he's pouring a bunch of
[1:00:59] blessings and prosperity on you because
[1:01:01] he likes you that much
[1:01:03] are you just his favorite
[1:01:06] if if society and everything's going so
[1:01:08] well and wonderful and the bleh you know
[1:01:10] oh i'm just doing so well and everything
[1:01:12] that i do just seems
[1:01:14] you know society just loves me what is
[1:01:16] this telling you
[1:01:18] do they really like you that much
[1:01:22] is is is this farm system this system
[1:01:25] designed to crush any manifestation of
[1:01:29] the seed of god inside of you
[1:01:31] does it really like you that much or
[1:01:33] does it have its own purpose for you
[1:01:36] right and napoleon says brother
[1:01:40] you're crazy
[1:01:42] i don't know what to tell you
[1:01:43] i just can't see it why would they like
[1:01:45] me this much right
[1:01:48] and besides i mean you're kind of high
[1:01:49] and mighty you're acting like you're the
[1:01:51] only christian here um
[1:01:52] you know i'm also a christian i go to
[1:01:54] church
[1:01:55] you know why
[1:01:57] why are you so much better
[1:01:59] well
[1:02:02] i had this this
[1:02:04] when i was i was putting my notes
[1:02:05] together for this
[1:02:07] um last night and i um
[1:02:10] i was
[1:02:11] i needed something to listen to i like
[1:02:12] to listen to music you know gospel music
[1:02:14] when i'm when i'm putting my notes
[1:02:15] together and stuff
[1:02:17] and um
[1:02:19] i had this it's an old you know gospel
[1:02:20] song i don't want to say what it is um
[1:02:24] and i i
[1:02:25] i wanted to listen to it and i didn't i
[1:02:26] just typed it into youtube right just to
[1:02:28] pull up some version of it to listen to
[1:02:30] and
[1:02:32] i type it in and just kind of click on
[1:02:33] the first result and not really look and
[1:02:36] tab out and go back to my notes
[1:02:38] and the music was pretty good you know
[1:02:39] it was pretty typical kind of a little
[1:02:41] bit of a
[1:02:43] sort of a contemporary vibe to it but
[1:02:45] whatever it wasn't egregious
[1:02:49] and
[1:02:52] you know it it is you know it was it was
[1:02:54] okay but for whatever reason i just got
[1:02:55] compelled hey click tap back over to
[1:02:57] that and watch the video
[1:02:59] and so i watched the video of the people
[1:03:00] performing this song and again the music
[1:03:03] wasn't crazy the people weren't dressed
[1:03:05] crazy it wasn't a bunch of
[1:03:07] pyrotechnics people didn't have purple
[1:03:08] mohawks it wasn't a christian rock band
[1:03:12] right
[1:03:13] but
[1:03:16] got really weirded out because the
[1:03:19] people on the stage
[1:03:21] are the way they're moving their bodies
[1:03:24] not sensual it wasn't like some sort of
[1:03:26] like sexy erotic thing
[1:03:29] it was a
[1:03:32] it was the sort of movement that i've
[1:03:34] seen before
[1:03:36] i wasn't always a good christian boy i
[1:03:38] went to a lot of rock concerts
[1:03:40] i've seen people move like that before
[1:03:43] and it happens in two places one when
[1:03:45] someone's completely cracked out on some
[1:03:47] sort of drug
[1:03:48] or two when they've completely given
[1:03:50] their body over to the devil at a rock
[1:03:52] concert that's the only time i've ever
[1:03:54] seen that
[1:03:56] and here are these people
[1:03:58] playing gospel music
[1:04:00] not in a particularly egregious way
[1:04:03] and moving their bodies in a way that i
[1:04:06] know is associated with satanic worship
[1:04:10] okay
[1:04:13] this is from satan's eden the god of
[1:04:15] this world today the worship person of
[1:04:17] this world today is satan and the people
[1:04:19] are ignorant of worshiping satan but
[1:04:22] it's satan impersonating himself as the
[1:04:24] church see as the church they worship
[1:04:26] satan thinking they are worshiping god
[1:04:29] through the church but it's but it's the
[1:04:31] way satan has done it
[1:04:34] okay you have people
[1:04:36] in this day who will worship satan they
[1:04:39] sing all the right words they raise
[1:04:41] their hands and say hallelujah they say
[1:04:43] praise the lord and the entire time they
[1:04:45] are not worshiping jehovah
[1:04:48] okay i don't care what comes out of
[1:04:50] their mouth i don't care how pleasant
[1:04:51] the words are i don't care how nice they
[1:04:53] are
[1:04:54] and how good morals they have
[1:04:57] they are worshiping satan why
[1:05:00] notice
[1:05:01] you say but wait a minute we preached
[1:05:04] the word
[1:05:06] look back here at my text tonight satan
[1:05:09] was the one that preached the word to
[1:05:11] eve first
[1:05:12] god hath said see
[1:05:16] people
[1:05:17] and by the way
[1:05:18] we will say we're in a message church we
[1:05:21] preach the word
[1:05:23] right
[1:05:24] we preach the word don't we
[1:05:28] so how you know what's
[1:05:30] it's that misconstruing that part of the
[1:05:33] scripture that applies to the day he'll
[1:05:35] tell he'll let you know all jesus did
[1:05:38] was perfectly well he'll let you know
[1:05:40] that moses did was all perfectly well
[1:05:42] but when you take the promises that they
[1:05:45] gave for this day
[1:05:47] then that was applied to another age
[1:05:51] that's the criteria for worshiping satan
[1:05:54] thinking you're worshiping god
[1:05:57] okay it is when people
[1:06:00] look at the promises of god
[1:06:02] right that's all he has to do see is to
[1:06:05] get the people to believe it that way
[1:06:08] and that's all
[1:06:09] you can't take one word away from it or
[1:06:11] add one word to it but that's what he
[1:06:13] does if he can get people
[1:06:16] even in message churches to say well
[1:06:18] that was for brother branham or that's
[1:06:20] for the ministers or that's for someone
[1:06:22] anyone other than me
[1:06:25] right
[1:06:26] then guess what i don't care how loud
[1:06:29] you hallelujah in church i don't care
[1:06:31] how long your skirts are how
[1:06:34] you know how sanctified your speech is
[1:06:36] on the job site it doesn't matter
[1:06:39] if you're if there's somewhere in your
[1:06:40] life where you're not
[1:06:42] taking god at his word if you're not
[1:06:44] living up to the seed that's in you
[1:06:48] right you have a seed inside of you and
[1:06:49] if you're sitting there going oh that's
[1:06:52] not for me we don't i mean we don't want
[1:06:54] to be fanatical after all you know
[1:06:57] you know i don't want to you know we
[1:06:58] don't want to look like some muddy old
[1:07:00] wild pig i mean goodness we have to live
[1:07:02] in a society in this you know
[1:07:04] slaughterhouse society
[1:07:06] you know we have to fit in with this we
[1:07:08] have to conform we can't we can't offend
[1:07:10] people who might want to slaughter us
[1:07:15] really
[1:07:16] you know
[1:07:17] i mean
[1:07:20] look
[1:07:25] all
[1:07:26] we we look at something like the
[1:07:27] holocaust right
[1:07:28] i think this is horrible and it is i
[1:07:30] mean you can't you can't
[1:07:33] look at some of the documentation the
[1:07:35] photographs the stories the written
[1:07:37] testimonies of like some of the the
[1:07:38] soldiers who who found those camps
[1:07:40] and you look at that and go this is i
[1:07:42] mean this is literally
[1:07:44] the it's some of the most horrific
[1:07:45] things you can think of and it's not
[1:07:47] just the holocaust they did something
[1:07:48] like this in the soviet union um i mean
[1:07:51] actually some of the most like the most
[1:07:53] horrible things i've ever seen didn't
[1:07:56] actually come out of the holocaust came
[1:07:57] out of out of russia
[1:07:58] um
[1:08:00] you know a lot of different places right
[1:08:03] no country has clean hands right if you
[1:08:05] think that oh we're americans and we're
[1:08:06] free from that oh be don't be so sure um
[1:08:11] everybody every nation has dirt on their
[1:08:12] hands because every nation is human and
[1:08:14] every nation
[1:08:15] has the potential to be evil
[1:08:18] right
[1:08:20] and we
[1:08:22] we look at these things and think how
[1:08:24] horrible it is and like wow those people
[1:08:25] just gave themselves over to the demonic
[1:08:27] spirits
[1:08:28] but don't forget
[1:08:30] that all the spirits
[1:08:32] that
[1:08:33] drove the people of the world the
[1:08:35] various tyrants of the world to
[1:08:37] slaughter people in mass in the most
[1:08:39] cruel and horrific ways you can think of
[1:08:42] those same spirits the same intellect
[1:08:45] that was that orchestrated the genocide
[1:08:47] is still around
[1:08:49] it's still here it didn't go away when
[1:08:52] hitler died
[1:08:53] it's still here and it's
[1:08:56] not targeting jews
[1:08:58] it's targeting you
[1:09:00] the devil isn't here
[1:09:02] to spoil the whipped cream for your
[1:09:04] strawberries okay
[1:09:06] the devil is here to kill you
[1:09:10] and
[1:09:12] harm your children
[1:09:14] okay
[1:09:15] this is what the devil's plans are
[1:09:17] and he's going to do it we think to
[1:09:20] ourselves oh it's a spiritual fight it's
[1:09:22] not real somehow because it's somehow in
[1:09:24] this ethereal realm and not in the flesh
[1:09:26] and blood where we can see it oh okay
[1:09:30] what do you call it exactly when a
[1:09:33] teenager overdoses
[1:09:35] right are they any less if they end up
[1:09:38] dying in a hospital bed because they
[1:09:40] couldn't get them hit with narcan fast
[1:09:41] enough
[1:09:42] are they any more or less dead than the
[1:09:45] kid who died in the
[1:09:46] holocaust right
[1:09:49] you know
[1:09:50] this system
[1:09:52] isn't just here
[1:09:55] to
[1:09:56] to ruin your day like it's not just here
[1:09:58] to to to make things inconvenient it's
[1:10:00] here to make things very convenient
[1:10:02] right up until the point they're not
[1:10:05] right
[1:10:06] because you know we'll continue our
[1:10:08] little story here
[1:10:09] napoleon
[1:10:11] he goes on he never leaves the farm
[1:10:14] and one day he goes to walk out of his
[1:10:17] little barn to go to his pig pen and eat
[1:10:19] his little corn feed
[1:10:21] the door's not open
[1:10:22] there ain't no way out
[1:10:24] every single day that he that every day
[1:10:27] of his life that gate was open and he
[1:10:29] could have walked out the door
[1:10:32] but instead he turned to turn and walk
[1:10:34] over to his trough and keep eating his
[1:10:36] carnal entertainment and feeding on all
[1:10:39] kinds of things that were not that were
[1:10:41] not in line with his seed the things
[1:10:46] do you really think the devil hasn't
[1:10:48] engineered facebook and twitter and
[1:10:51] youtube to not suppress your seed
[1:10:56] do you really think do you really think
[1:10:58] that farmer didn't engineer that pig
[1:11:00] feed to produce the sort of body and
[1:11:03] lifestyle in that pig that he wanted
[1:11:07] right
[1:11:08] didn't do you think he didn't make it so
[1:11:10] that that pig would be so addicted to
[1:11:13] that thing he would never turn and walk
[1:11:15] away
[1:11:16] that every day he got up he could just
[1:11:18] walk and stuff his face you know stuff
[1:11:20] his face full of more of it instead of
[1:11:22] walking away and going the other way and
[1:11:24] going to the the environment and the
[1:11:25] diet that god intended for him
[1:11:28] of course he didn't he engineered it
[1:11:30] specifically to where he wouldn't be
[1:11:32] able to drop it he would and so every
[1:11:34] day he goes and he stuffs his face until
[1:11:37] one day he walks tries to walk out the
[1:11:38] door and goes oh the barn door's closed
[1:11:42] you know
[1:11:42] and now i can't get out
[1:11:45] that every day that he could have walked
[1:11:48] out until he couldn't
[1:11:51] and then when he's sitting there
[1:11:52] and here's the farmer sharpening his
[1:11:54] knife
[1:11:55] and the chain hoy's going clink clink
[1:11:57] clink clink clink clink clank and a big
[1:11:58] old meat hook on the end of it he's
[1:12:00] going oh
[1:12:02] peter was right
[1:12:04] should have listened
[1:12:05] and the thing and oh he's gonna run
[1:12:07] around and they're gonna be weeping and
[1:12:08] wailing and all kinds of gnashing of
[1:12:10] teeth and wee wee wee wee all the way
[1:12:11] around the barn
[1:12:12] and
[1:12:13] too bad not getting out
[1:12:16] right
[1:12:17] you know the farmer's going calm down
[1:12:19] little pig what did you expect this was
[1:12:22] your choice
[1:12:23] you could have walked out anytime it's
[1:12:25] time to pay the piper little pig i gave
[1:12:28] you all kinds of of a fun and i put a
[1:12:32] roof over your head and i put all kinds
[1:12:34] of luxury in your life and now it's time
[1:12:36] to fulfill your purpose
[1:12:38] right
[1:12:40] and one day there's going to be a lot of
[1:12:42] people who wake up going oh no
[1:12:45] those crazy people were right
[1:12:47] that little man was right and it's time
[1:12:50] to fulfill our purpose
[1:12:52] and there's no way out of the barn now
[1:12:56] right
[1:12:57] now
[1:13:01] i said there's a story of two little
[1:13:02] pigs and i i know that that's that
[1:13:04] particular little
[1:13:05] thing is kind of like ah scary right we
[1:13:08] everybody like a lot of times i know you
[1:13:10] know when i'm sitting over there i get
[1:13:11] like almost like um
[1:13:15] you're not gonna really get a lot of
[1:13:16] people like like conversions don't real
[1:13:18] not strong ones don't happen from fear
[1:13:20] right when you scare the people half to
[1:13:22] death it's like yeah how long is that
[1:13:24] going to last really right
[1:13:26] i'm not here to scare you guys i'm not
[1:13:28] here to terrify you and think you know
[1:13:30] repent or perish though i mean you
[1:13:31] should repent or you will perish that is
[1:13:33] the truth however
[1:13:35] i want to say
[1:13:38] if i could
[1:13:39] don't think about napoleon let's tell
[1:13:42] the other side of that story
[1:13:44] right let's look at his story because
[1:13:46] his story was not one of when he's in
[1:13:49] the farm
[1:13:50] peter when he's in the farm he's not
[1:13:52] looking around seeing a slaughterhouse
[1:13:53] he sees fun and happiness and joy and
[1:13:55] luxury just like everyone else
[1:13:57] all he sees
[1:13:59] his motivation was not i'm running from
[1:14:02] destruction
[1:14:04] it was i'm running towards a fulfillment
[1:14:06] of a purpose within me
[1:14:08] right i am i am and he and he burst
[1:14:11] through that he
[1:14:12] he
[1:14:13] takes that first step of faith outside
[1:14:16] of that pig pen and he runs for that
[1:14:18] tree line as hard as he can go and it's
[1:14:20] liberating and it's wonderful and he's
[1:14:22] going freedom as he runs the whole way
[1:14:24] you know when he gets to the woods
[1:14:26] and it's really exhilarating and then it
[1:14:28] gets hard
[1:14:29] right because you realize oh yeah
[1:14:31] actually um life was kind of easy when
[1:14:33] all of society was sort of
[1:14:36] you know
[1:14:36] i wasn't going against the grain of
[1:14:38] society
[1:14:39] you know when this system designed to
[1:14:41] push me into a slaughterhouse i'm no
[1:14:43] longer going with that flow i'm now
[1:14:45] going against that float things get hard
[1:14:48] right
[1:14:49] your flesh doesn't like it too good the
[1:14:51] nights are a little bit cold when you're
[1:14:53] not adapted to the weather your body
[1:14:55] isn't is all hairless and built for a
[1:14:57] barn
[1:14:59] night you know cold rainy nights are
[1:15:01] kind of tough you know
[1:15:02] there ain't no there is no
[1:15:04] carnal entertainment trough to go feed
[1:15:06] out of you gotta go dig around in the
[1:15:08] dirt
[1:15:09] you know but
[1:15:11] you know his nose hurts you know pigs
[1:15:12] they have that snout
[1:15:13] which i kind of want to drop back to
[1:15:15] that cause i wanna you can come on
[1:15:20] yeah
[1:15:21] i mean when you look at the differences
[1:15:23] here that that wild pig
[1:15:25] he's got that that thick fur i mean that
[1:15:27] stuff is
[1:15:29] i know you always ever use like a boar
[1:15:31] brush
[1:15:32] boar brussel brush i know katie has she
[1:15:33] loves them but she might be the only one
[1:15:36] because an old-fashioned type of thing
[1:15:37] um
[1:15:38] but uh anyways i mean you can brush your
[1:15:40] hair with that those bristles i mean
[1:15:41] they're they're stiff they're thick they
[1:15:44] are um those pigs those wild boars their
[1:15:47] snout is like rock hard because they
[1:15:48] have to dig they will uproot trees
[1:15:51] to get it at the things that they eat
[1:15:52] right
[1:15:53] and that that farm pig when he first
[1:15:55] gets out in the woods life is tough at
[1:15:57] first it's hard his flesh has to
[1:15:59] sacrifice a lot
[1:16:01] right his his snout bleeds and gets all
[1:16:04] calloused and
[1:16:06] blistered from having to dig around but
[1:16:09] guess what he's now feeding on the diet
[1:16:11] that god intended him to feed on
[1:16:13] he's now feeding on
[1:16:15] what you know he's in the environment
[1:16:17] yeah it's not so easy it's not so
[1:16:19] luxurious but it's the environment that
[1:16:21] god intended to him to
[1:16:23] to be in
[1:16:24] and now
[1:16:26] excuse me first of all
[1:16:28] he's not he's no longer that he suddenly
[1:16:30] has a a deep
[1:16:32] happiness and a fulfillment within him
[1:16:35] because that thing down inside of him
[1:16:37] that was hungering for this kind of
[1:16:38] lifestyle is now satisfied and he's
[1:16:42] the temptation to turn around one night
[1:16:44] when no one's looking and run back and
[1:16:46] stick his head through the bars the
[1:16:47] fence you know eat some of that sweet
[1:16:49] corn
[1:16:49] it's there because his flesh likes it
[1:16:52] right his flesh likes it if it wasn't
[1:16:54] enticing to his flesh his ancestors
[1:16:55] never would have got caught on it in the
[1:16:56] first place
[1:16:58] right
[1:16:59] it's designed to do that
[1:17:02] but if he will stay in that environment
[1:17:05] if you'll stay in that environment
[1:17:08] and let
[1:17:09] that seed be fulfilled within him
[1:17:13] something crazy happens right that's why
[1:17:15] i chose pigs
[1:17:17] you know what happens and i just read
[1:17:18] this off of i didn't put it on the on
[1:17:20] the powerpoint but i read it from the
[1:17:23] department of the dnr for arkansas
[1:17:25] because it's one of those states where
[1:17:26] this is an actual issue
[1:17:28] what happens when a domesticated pig
[1:17:30] gets out in the woods
[1:17:32] right
[1:17:33] 90 days
[1:17:35] in 90 days or less it can be as short as
[1:17:38] 30 days that pretty pink farm pig will
[1:17:41] turn back into that wild boar in 30 to
[1:17:44] 90 days
[1:17:46] every one of those genes that god put
[1:17:48] inside of it that had been suppressed by
[1:17:51] that man-made laodicean farm system
[1:17:54] reactivate they all come back
[1:17:57] right he's no long like
[1:18:01] he's not this
[1:18:02] this runt this thing that can be kicked
[1:18:04] around that goes running from the big
[1:18:06] bad wolf he's this
[1:18:08] faith warrior monster who's got tusk
[1:18:10] sticking out of his mouth that'll rip
[1:18:12] monsters to pieces they grow this this
[1:18:14] hide on their across their shoulders
[1:18:16] that you can't cut with a knife it's
[1:18:17] like an armor right that hide is thick
[1:18:21] they're waterproof i mean these things
[1:18:23] are monsters
[1:18:24] and he doesn't go running wee wee from
[1:18:26] the big bad wolf the big bad wolf goes
[1:18:28] running from him right you know the
[1:18:30] farmer and all of his dogs can go chase
[1:18:32] him in the woods but it's the farmer and
[1:18:34] the dogs that are go running away
[1:18:36] right why because he's now in line with
[1:18:40] the seed that god intended to him to
[1:18:41] have back in eden he was this way in
[1:18:45] eden he wasn't some pink pink hairless
[1:18:48] weakling
[1:18:49] right he had dominion over his domain
[1:18:52] right you ever hear you know it's you
[1:18:55] he was something to be to be reckoned
[1:18:58] with
[1:18:59] and a real powerhouse
[1:19:01] and that's what he goes back to just by
[1:19:04] going back
[1:19:05] like
[1:19:06] by going he he gets back into his eating
[1:19:09] condition by feeding on the eden on the
[1:19:12] eden
[1:19:13] diet and the eating lifestyle living
[1:19:15] that eden lifestyle and his body will
[1:19:17] naturally change
[1:19:20] look
[1:19:21] when he goes back in the woods
[1:19:24] he doesn't walk out in the woods and go
[1:19:27] trying to push out his his fur you know
[1:19:29] he's not going
[1:19:30] give me tusks
[1:19:32] right
[1:19:33] he can sit there and strain and get blue
[1:19:35] in the face and get a hernia
[1:19:37] trying to trying to do this
[1:19:40] and it won't happen
[1:19:42] because it's not by his
[1:19:45] not by his straining and trying all he
[1:19:48] does is just stick to that that seed let
[1:19:52] the seed have dominion over his behavior
[1:19:55] and the body change was in him the whole
[1:19:57] time
[1:19:58] right it was there the whole time he
[1:20:01] didn't have to do anything other than
[1:20:04] follow the instructions of the seed
[1:20:06] follow that that word that god put
[1:20:09] inside of him and the body change was
[1:20:11] there the whole time
[1:20:14] right
[1:20:20] now
[1:20:23] this is a cnn headline
[1:20:26] um that i saw the other day
[1:20:28] the binging button in fact scientists
[1:20:30] can reverse aging in mice the goal is to
[1:20:32] do the same to humans or for humans now
[1:20:36] why is this
[1:20:39] how does this work right
[1:20:41] um oh that text is kind of small um you
[1:20:44] might not be able to read that um what
[1:20:47] time is it
[1:20:49] well i'll give you kind of a synopsis
[1:20:51] you don't have to read it so much um the
[1:20:53] overview is basically
[1:20:55] some scientists figured out that the way
[1:20:56] the aging process works there's certain
[1:20:58] there's certain things called
[1:20:59] epigenetics these are basically tags in
[1:21:01] your dna that turn genes on and off at
[1:21:03] certain times okay
[1:21:05] functionally speaking if you eat a bunch
[1:21:07] of sugar your pancreas says we need you
[1:21:09] know your pancreas is supposed to
[1:21:10] produce insulin so you can process that
[1:21:11] sugar and when that sugar enters your
[1:21:13] bloodstream it triggers hits an
[1:21:15] epigenetic tag in your pancreas cells
[1:21:17] and your pancreas that tag activates
[1:21:19] your insulin gene and your insulin gets
[1:21:21] produced and it deals with your sugar
[1:21:24] okay
[1:21:26] same thing happens that's how your body
[1:21:27] works with everything okay
[1:21:29] even aging your body knows that as you
[1:21:32] age there are certain genes that need to
[1:21:33] be turned off or on like if you're a
[1:21:35] little kid and you need to grow up into
[1:21:37] an adult there are genes that turn on so
[1:21:39] that you grow and then once you grow and
[1:21:41] hit
[1:21:42] you know however tall you're supposed to
[1:21:44] be those genes turn back off and you
[1:21:46] you know stop growing
[1:21:48] well
[1:21:50] this stuff happens for everything and um
[1:21:55] the scientists figured out
[1:21:57] we can go back through some
[1:21:59] you know woohoo science
[1:22:01] um we can go in and reactivate genes
[1:22:04] that deactivated in your youth
[1:22:07] and they did this with mice
[1:22:08] and what they did was they took a young
[1:22:10] mou an old mouse
[1:22:13] and they put
[1:22:14] um
[1:22:15] they activated the genes
[1:22:16] in his eyes because his eyes he'd
[1:22:18] basically gone blind from age right he
[1:22:20] got you know that that happens
[1:22:22] um and when they reactivated those genes
[1:22:25] for his eyes
[1:22:27] it turned his eyes back to a young
[1:22:29] mouse's eyes
[1:22:31] okay
[1:22:32] and so he makes some statements
[1:22:35] um
[1:22:36] so if we reverse aging these diseases
[1:22:38] should not happen we have the technology
[1:22:40] today to be able to go into your
[1:22:43] hundreds without worrying worrying about
[1:22:45] getting cancer in your 70s heart disease
[1:22:47] in your 80s and alzheimer's in your 90s
[1:22:50] sinclair told an audience at life itself
[1:22:53] a health and wellness event presented in
[1:22:54] partnership with partnership with cnn
[1:22:57] this is the world that is coming it's
[1:22:59] literally a question of when and for
[1:23:01] most of us it's going to happen in our
[1:23:04] lifetimes
[1:23:05] sinclair told the audience
[1:23:07] somehow the cells know the body can
[1:23:09] reset itself and they still know which
[1:23:12] genes should be on when they were young
[1:23:15] sinclair said we think we're tapping
[1:23:17] into an ancient regeneration system that
[1:23:20] some animals use when you cut off the
[1:23:22] limb of a salamander it regrows the limb
[1:23:25] the tail of a fish will the tail of a
[1:23:27] fish will grow back a finger of a mouse
[1:23:29] will grow back
[1:23:30] that discovery indicates that there is a
[1:23:32] backup copy of youthfulness
[1:23:35] information stormed in the body he added
[1:23:39] we believe we have found the master
[1:23:42] control switch a way to rewind the clock
[1:23:44] he added the body will then wake up
[1:23:47] remember how to behave remember how to
[1:23:49] regenerate and we'll be young again even
[1:23:52] if you're already old and have an
[1:23:54] illness
[1:23:56] science has discovered the rapture
[1:24:01] okay
[1:24:02] science has discovered what the system
[1:24:05] that god put in place since the
[1:24:07] foundation of the world that every human
[1:24:10] has within them the ability to
[1:24:12] regenerate back to their eden condition
[1:24:14] the genes are there it's not just some
[1:24:16] fairy tale
[1:24:18] the scientists are proving it
[1:24:21] you live in that eaten condition you
[1:24:23] live with that even eaten lifestyle you
[1:24:25] have a relationship with the tree of
[1:24:27] life
[1:24:29] and that tree of life will reactivate
[1:24:31] those genes and your body changes here
[1:24:34] the whole time okay
[1:24:40] i mean
[1:24:41] am i the only one who wants to jump up
[1:24:42] and down um
[1:24:44] i mean i think that's a pretty good
[1:24:46] place to end this you know musicians can
[1:24:48] come on back
[1:24:49] um you know
[1:24:52] think of that if you know when you're in
[1:24:54] every day when you're thinking to
[1:24:56] yourself
[1:24:57] how shall i
[1:24:59] live my life today
[1:25:01] right as my my dad always said if you're
[1:25:03] preaching
[1:25:04] it's all nice and wonderful to give
[1:25:06] people deep dark mysteries but if you
[1:25:07] can't tell them how it helps them put
[1:25:08] their pants on and go to work on monday
[1:25:10] morning you wasted their time okay
[1:25:12] so i'm telling you if i could help you
[1:25:14] put your pants on on monday and go to
[1:25:16] work right
[1:25:19] get
[1:25:20] understand that
[1:25:22] let your
[1:25:23] let your life be in line with that eaten
[1:25:25] condition because
[1:25:27] the eden condition was not that they
[1:25:29] lived in paradise
[1:25:30] it wasn't that they
[1:25:32] had no pain and sorrow that was part of
[1:25:34] it but that wasn't that was a symptom
[1:25:37] the actual eden condition is that they
[1:25:40] had a communion with the tree of life
[1:25:42] the actual eden condition was a
[1:25:45] relationship
[1:25:48] okay
[1:25:49] it wasn't
[1:25:50] it wasn't a um you know we get so caught
[1:25:53] up on the on the paradise we forget who
[1:25:55] made the paradise
[1:25:57] right
[1:25:59] you can live in an eaten condition now
[1:26:02] your physical body doesn't have to
[1:26:05] change for you to get back to that even
[1:26:07] condition because the
[1:26:09] you know that that veil was ripped in
[1:26:12] half one day that flaming sword that
[1:26:14] guarded the path back to eden is no
[1:26:16] longer there
[1:26:18] you can go back to that tree of life and
[1:26:20] have that relationship so every day when
[1:26:22] you wake up you ask yourself how will i
[1:26:26] have a relationship with god today
[1:26:29] how will i live my life today
[1:26:32] you know make those decisions
[1:26:34] as tempting as it may be remember
[1:26:38] that
[1:26:39] that seed
[1:26:41] that seed of god is expecting
[1:26:43] a certain kind of relationship it's a
[1:26:45] certain kind of lifestyle
[1:26:47] and you as long as you as you stay in
[1:26:50] line with that
[1:26:52] that is the secret to to the to
[1:26:54] fulfilling the uh you allow that seed to
[1:26:57] have dominion in your life
[1:26:59] and not squash it with the things of the
[1:27:02] world not let the carnal things get in
[1:27:04] your way
[1:27:05] right not let
[1:27:07] anything come between you and christ
[1:27:09] because the moment you do
[1:27:11] you're gonna be back on the farm
[1:27:14] you know
[1:27:15] so that's we'll we'll have a have a
[1:27:17] all stand and sing a song we have a
[1:27:20] do we have a song
[1:27:22] it is no secret what god can do
[1:27:27] is give me a key
[1:27:30] see is no
[1:27:33] secret
[1:27:35] [Applause]
[1:27:38] what
[1:27:39] god can do
[1:27:44] [Music]
[1:27:53] he'll do for
[1:27:56] you
[1:27:58] [Music]
[1:28:05] [Music]
[1:28:10] you
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:21] what god

[1:29:03] [Music]
[1:29:12] is
[1:29:20] [Music]
[1:29:25] [Applause]
[1:29:27] [Music]
[1:29:35] my mind aren't you glad for that
[1:29:40] [Music]
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:29:57] [Applause]
[1:29:58] [Music]
[1:30:03] yes
[1:30:05] [Music]
[1:30:06] [Applause]
[1:30:08] [Music]
[1:30:18] wow
[1:30:19] amen hallelujah
[1:30:27] i remember years ago when i first
[1:30:29] started preaching
[1:30:30] i'd only been preaching probably three
[1:30:32] months and i preached my first sermon at
[1:30:34] happy valley big audience and
[1:30:37] brother donnie made a statement behind
[1:30:39] me i never forgot it and every once in a
[1:30:41] while i get to live it like tonight i
[1:30:43] got to live it
[1:30:44] brother donnie come up behind me and he
[1:30:46] said there's only two things that will
[1:30:47] make a preacher want a microphone
[1:30:50] somebody ahead of him who either can't
[1:30:52] preach
[1:30:53] or somebody ahead of him who really can
[1:30:57] and i really wanted the microphone
[1:30:58] tonight for the second reason
[1:31:01] i wish i would have said that i wish i
[1:31:03] had to preach that and i will
[1:31:07] amen just letting it over the mat praise
[1:31:10] the lord i'm glad that
[1:31:12] no minister has a copyright on the word
[1:31:14] of god it came from the mind of god did
[1:31:16] you enjoy
[1:31:17] that tonight i i would start
[1:31:20] going down my notes but i just i i i was
[1:31:23] blown away by some of that stuff that
[1:31:25] was
[1:31:26] that was a bit of all right and i you
[1:31:29] know at the end there especially
[1:31:31] well listen to me i say at the end but
[1:31:33] you can see all my red in between the
[1:31:35] black where the these are me taking off
[1:31:38] on my own sermons in between his notes
[1:31:40] amen so i do that
[1:31:42] but um
[1:31:44] you know
[1:31:45] it's always been curious to me
[1:31:48] and i've talked about this with a number
[1:31:49] of brothers
[1:31:51] over the years
[1:31:52] how that
[1:31:54] when brother branham saw those seven
[1:31:56] visions and those visions represented
[1:31:59] everything that would happen
[1:32:02] all the way up to the annihilation
[1:32:05] of the united states
[1:32:07] which the bride doesn't see she's
[1:32:09] already in glory
[1:32:11] so you can see that there were visions
[1:32:14] that he showed him about what would
[1:32:16] happen in politics and nazism and
[1:32:18] fascism communism he showed him visions
[1:32:21] about what would happen to the to the
[1:32:23] social fabric to the morality of the
[1:32:26] people and the fall of women showed him
[1:32:28] all of those social issues
[1:32:31] and then he came and showed him
[1:32:33] uh a realm of science
[1:32:36] and was showing and the last thing that
[1:32:38] brother branham saw that
[1:32:40] science would accomplish
[1:32:42] before the last vision which was the
[1:32:44] seventh one
[1:32:45] was the pilotless car
[1:32:48] a vehicle driving down super highways
[1:32:51] with no steering wheel in it and we have
[1:32:54] that
[1:32:55] and it's moving and migrating toward
[1:32:57] mass production and mass mass usage
[1:33:01] and we are already living
[1:33:03] in the last i know they talk about you
[1:33:06] know
[1:33:06] building a colony on the moon and going
[1:33:09] to mars but god didn't show the brother
[1:33:10] branham any of that
[1:33:12] they've got a way now that science has
[1:33:15] discovered
[1:33:16] how that they can
[1:33:17] suddenly they've got you said science
[1:33:20] and has the rapture amen
[1:33:22] but you know but now my mind was
[1:33:24] thinking i thought to myself they'll
[1:33:26] never make it
[1:33:28] because the last thing that science
[1:33:30] would ever achieve that would be big now
[1:33:32] there's lots of things science would
[1:33:33] achieve that brother m didn't see but
[1:33:35] the last big item was driverless cars
[1:33:39] and we're here
[1:33:40] and i thought to myself tonight and i
[1:33:42] jotted this down in my note and this is
[1:33:44] going to be a brainstorm for me to go
[1:33:46] the next couple days and think about if
[1:33:47] you call me
[1:33:48] and i sound distracted this is why
[1:33:52] and
[1:33:53] because i know that
[1:33:55] god
[1:33:57] chased adam and eve out of the garden of
[1:33:58] eden
[1:34:00] lest they partake of the tree of life
[1:34:02] and live forever in a fallen state
[1:34:04] so they could have broken into eternal
[1:34:06] life but it would have been perverted
[1:34:07] thing you see
[1:34:08] god stopped them at the tower of babel
[1:34:11] after testifying this they've begun to
[1:34:14] do and now nothing can be restrained
[1:34:16] even whatsoever they've imagined and
[1:34:17] brother branham says they were trying to
[1:34:19] break back into heaven and
[1:34:21] apparently when i read the scripture god
[1:34:23] is saying i'm going to have to stop this
[1:34:26] i'm gonna have to interrupt this program
[1:34:27] or they're gonna make it
[1:34:29] and now here they're saying we can
[1:34:31] produce what the rapture can produce i'm
[1:34:32] here to tell you they're not going to
[1:34:34] make it because god's going to stop the
[1:34:36] process because we are already ready for
[1:34:39] a rapture
[1:34:41] amen and even if they accomplished it i
[1:34:43] thought to myself
[1:34:44] even see because if they accomplished it
[1:34:47] it would be
[1:34:49] it would be
[1:34:50] a perversion
[1:34:52] it would be a perverted
[1:34:54] result
[1:34:55] if adam and eve had done that it would
[1:34:57] have been a perverted result had they
[1:34:58] had they broke back into heaven and
[1:35:00] eternal life it would have produced a
[1:35:02] perverted result and what they're
[1:35:03] showing in science every time because
[1:35:05] it's true of knowledge good and evil
[1:35:07] will produce a perverted result
[1:35:10] does that sound crazy to you
[1:35:13] i mean that that's that is that is such
[1:35:15] way out there thinking and i wouldn't
[1:35:17] even be thinking like that except here
[1:35:20] are the leading scientists of the world
[1:35:21] saying it's going to happen in in your
[1:35:23] lifetime i'm here to tell you something
[1:35:25] friends the rapture is happening in your
[1:35:27] lifetime
[1:35:30] is me and matt the only ones who want to
[1:35:32] run and jump
[1:35:35] oh hallelujah friends uh the day look up
[1:35:38] your redemption draweth not amen
[1:35:43] wow
[1:35:44] say it backwards wow
[1:35:47] oh my
[1:35:49] oh i just i can't even go on i'll just
[1:35:52] i'll keep preaching all night long we're
[1:35:54] going to take up a couple of prayer
[1:35:55] requests the only
[1:35:57] uh two that i that i got for tonight and
[1:36:00] other than brother brad we wanted to
[1:36:02] remember um your friend is named carl uh
[1:36:05] it's carl
[1:36:07] rebecca's friend yeah
[1:36:10] okay it's okay and uh he is uh he's
[1:36:13] facing open hearts
[1:36:16] okay and then the situation with the old
[1:36:19] house
[1:36:20] yeah all right
[1:36:21] so we we've got to remember brother brad
[1:36:23] and sister rebecca and i mean i get i
[1:36:26] get what the
[1:36:27] what the owners are doing hey it's it's
[1:36:30] business
[1:36:30] uh but uh but brother brad says rebecca
[1:36:33] are facing a real life problem
[1:36:35] so call it what you want but this is a
[1:36:37] real crisis for them
[1:36:39] so let's pray god will give them another
[1:36:41] place right away there's so many of us
[1:36:43] in here that can testify that god has
[1:36:45] done that so many times amen so let's
[1:36:47] believe that he'll do it for them also
[1:36:49] this man carl that sister rebecca works
[1:36:52] with also
[1:36:54] we've got a request in online please
[1:36:56] keep sister peggy whitehead from georgia
[1:36:59] in prayer she and several family members
[1:37:02] have coveted they've come down with
[1:37:04] cover they're asking for prayer that
[1:37:05] came in over the internet now but the
[1:37:08] jack writes
[1:37:09] and he says i got a prayer request
[1:37:13] he's been witnessing to a man it happens
[1:37:14] to be his name as jason was going to
[1:37:17] meet him to dig a pond and he and his
[1:37:20] wife have coveted so they caught covet
[1:37:21] as well
[1:37:23] and and i told him we would have prayer
[1:37:25] for them
[1:37:26] and and i felt impressed to tell him
[1:37:29] what god done
[1:37:31] in our age you don't have to give
[1:37:32] brother jack but a slight little open
[1:37:34] door he's like brother rodney or sister
[1:37:36] gene you better get ready to hear a
[1:37:38] sermon amen and so
[1:37:41] so he says i felt impressed to tell him
[1:37:43] what god has done in our age he told me
[1:37:46] his wife and daughter was going to be
[1:37:49] baptized so that opened the door for me
[1:37:51] to tell him the right way
[1:37:53] to be baptized praise our lord i love
[1:37:55] telling people the real word amen so
[1:37:59] so brother jack is asking for prayer
[1:38:01] amen let's believe that brother jack
[1:38:03] will rescue these people from a false
[1:38:05] baptism and teach them the right way to
[1:38:08] be baptized amen that's the only request
[1:38:11] that i saw if one came in uh and i
[1:38:14] missed it um
[1:38:17] okay that's not one uh so i apologize to
[1:38:20] you you should always try to get them to
[1:38:22] me uh early i appreciate the people who
[1:38:24] do and i i try to get them immediately
[1:38:26] put up because i'll forget if i don't
[1:38:28] and i think i've got them all
[1:38:30] as i remember appraisal we had we've had
[1:38:33] some from past services we've been
[1:38:35] praying about i'm sure you've still got
[1:38:36] those on your heart

[1:38:42] the the the bones healed back
[1:38:45] wonderfully
[1:38:46] he wasn't terribly affected by the

[1:38:55] for brother mason amen talk to brother

[1:38:59] trust and believe the lord
[1:39:01] for a complete reconstruction of his of
[1:39:04] his shoulder uh so that he doesn't have
[1:39:06] to let a doctor do it he'd rather have
[1:39:08] the great physician do it how many be
[1:39:10] praying for our brother i told him we
[1:39:11] will keep praying that the lord will
