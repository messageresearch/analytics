know one day we'll understand all these things better by and by we'll have to just greet each other and and say sometimes I just don't understand all always wide things have to happen and why this has to happen but we'll understand it one day amen I've been singing that song for days now I just I we have a promise though we have an absolute in this day we don't have to just wander about and worry and and like the world does and oh what's going to happen here what's going to happen there but we have an absolute amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to Malachi the third chapter foreign it's a very short reading for I am the Lord I change not therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed heavenly father as we come here tonight Lord so thankful to be gathered once more with the precious purchase of your blood Lord that you you paid the awful ultimate price for it how we come here Lord just to gather together and so glad Lord to be in this this house has been set aside Lord for worship that's been dedicated Lord to thee and and for the purpose of coming here Lord and we're so thankful to have a place Lord to be able to come out of the weather and oh God we're so thankful for so many things Lord we just asked tonight Lord that you would just be with us as a song was sung earlier about Holy Spirit you're welcome in this place oh God feel that just fill the entire atmosphere Lord God that's what we come here for it's not just to be seen or to check off a a box Lord for the week but we come here Lord expecting to hear from you Lord we come here Lord expecting to lay down our burdens Lord one more time and take up that precious mantle of Salvation Lord of righteousness and walk out of here oh God different from when we came in Lord may that be the the testimony in the prayer of each person in here tonight father that we wouldn't leave the same way we came in Lord that we would all leave Lord high in higher Heights Lord and deeper depths with thee father God granted us our prayer we love you may you add your blessings to the reading of the word tonight in Jesus name we pray amen you can be seated and I certainly thank the Lord for his word and and I'm so glad that we have a constant my title for the sermon tonight is the unchangeable god and I'm so glad that we have something in this world that's unchanging I'm the Lord and I change not and you know I was just thinking about going down the road and I um you'll many times will go different places and we'll see where there used to be Woods or there used to be a place where we'd go hunting big Warehouse or it's a shopping center or we look and see where so and so used to live or we maybe we'll look back in Nostalgia and we'll say hey we used to I used to go into the uh the store with a dollar and I used to get a for a one dollar I could get a Coke and a candy bar and a whole sack full of Penny Candy there's no even such thing as that anymore there's no such thing as Penny Candy but things change and and we see things like that and going up 16 you see how that used to be just a bunch of wilderness all the way to the matter right the people for Metter now it's it's um it's it's already they've got the big thing going up the the electric car planning and so we see changes all the time and and and I'm so glad that we have something in this world that doesn't change and we've got um and I think about how that nothing lasts forever not one thing on this world is going to last forever thank you brother I was uh reading about I thought it was very interesting of a um a story about how when we go to the grocery store now y'all stay with me for just a minute I don't I don't try to lose you and get lost in the weeds give me just a second I'm going to go ahead and do this before I even get started coming up down here there we go now I can preach so I heard about I heard about this when we go to the grocery store and you buy a pound of of hamburger right it's measured out well under whose standard okay so you've got to have a standard somewhere so if you if you measure it by the standard of uh of a kilogram or a pound or whatever but it's got to go back to the original there's got to be an absolute somewhere and for 130 something years our absolute for measurement somebody probably knows this already was a a hunk of platinum and a hunk of iridium made by the French people because they had tried to have many different metals they tried steel they tried gold they tried water they tried all kinds of different things and everything would fluctuate it would never hold the same weight it was dependent on the atmosphere it was depending on the surrounding around it maybe the magnetic pool I don't know what it was but everything would fluctuate until they they came down to this one piece of metal that was absolute the absolute and it was platinum and iridium and it's called the international prototype kilogram and since 1889 every time you buy a pound of hamburger it's based on that hunk of metal over in France I didn't even know that but it's based upon that that is the absolute for measurement for for mass in the United States and the whole world until recently because they found out that even for 130 something years that was the absolute but they realized that it's not the absolute because they've realized now that that it starts that matter releases little Trace Amounts little by little and it's taken 130 years but that that what they call the Big K the kilogram has now lost the amount of mass that'll equal about your eyelash in 130 years now that's pretty good but that's not perfect so what have they done they have now based it upon quantum physics and quantum mechanics and they've left off the Earth and they've gone into the atmospheres they've gone into the universe where they're getting their measurement from I'm like well they could have done that a long time ago see because even now they're realizing that nothing on this Earth nothing in the natural world lasts forever not one thing and the way they measure it now is by how fast it depletes because that now they know that it's gonna deplete and they can anticipate the depletion and they've got that down to a science and it starts with a decimal point and 33 zeros behind it then it starts with a number now that's somebody's got a whole lot more time than I do to try to figure out if I'm going to get a good deal on my hamburger or not but we've got to have a uh an absolute somewhere and if we try and and they even said that I remember reading this that back in the old days that if a a vehicle ever got up to the great speed of 30 miles an hour that it would leave the Earth and fly off into space that's what they believed boy have they proven that wrong and all the time science books are being proven every day they're having to go back and rewrite it and rewrite it all the things that we used to hold um as the absolute are no longer you know governments are falling things that the the foundations of our very government is being washed out from under we can see wave after wave of of of the of the the Communists and the and it started if you go all the way back you've got to go back and I remember talking the other day about how that women first started bobbing their hair off in the 20s that was right after World War One and how that it started that Spirit of rebellion and that was a spirit of rebellion on the on the woman's part that she didn't want to be under the headship of a man anymore it was a women's lib movement and they were smoke like bro oh brother Branham hated it he said I'd rather see my wife drunk on the floor than smoking a cigarette but that was part of that women's Liberation they got the vote they wanted to vote and be just like the man have all the things but it was a spirit of rebellion that was upon them not wanting to be under the subjection of a man or a husband or what they called the patriarchal society and that so it started in the I would say farther back then the brother was talking the other night about all the different changes even from the 1800s and and uh and coming on up into the philosophies and and now we've then we came up into you know you had Karl Marx and different ones and everybody had a better idea for a society and and so so in the 20s it started but there's a funny thing that happened in 1928. and this was in Germany does anybody know what happened in 1928 in Germany it was the invention the invention of the magnetic tape recorder that the rest of the world knew nothing about but the Germans had it it was top secret and nobody knew about it and the rest of the world didn't even have it the Germans had it and then the war started and then we was in the midst of the war and then not until after the war did the United States get its hand upon it because they went in and they and they took the bunkers and they took the headquarters and they found the machinery and they found the tape recorders and they found the equipment and brought it back to the United States so tonight we have the ability to hear the very voice of God through our prophet courtesy of Nazi Germany amen oh I love how God does things he's the unchanging God but he comes in unexpected ways amen do you believe that the unchangeable god but uh you go back and I don't mean to yell and bust your eardrums if I do just say Hey Brother come on brother but I preach at the other church and can't nobody hear me over there so after church I had a brother he's like brother can you speak a little louder I'm like oh you you think I need to speak a little louder okay all right well praise the Lord I'll try but that Spirit of rebellion that got started back there and and we know that it's a spirit because it came on up and into the into the 20s and the 30s and you had the music and started off with the with the Ragtime oh it was kind it was harmless but it had a little striptease that went with it and the little little dance of the woman little Ragtime music get out and do the Charleston or whatever they did back then it was synonymous with the with the prohibition and the drinking the liquor and all these things like that and then from there it came on up to Jazz and then that was a little more seductive and they and they would have the the dances and the fan dancers and the different things like that and you see where this progression is going our society is getting a little bit more but the but the culture is going down science is going up culture goes down and so we know it's a spirit because in the what was it the 40s or 50s you had James Dean and he made a movie called Rebel Without a Cause he was just a rebel to be a rebel and and so that just tells you that was that Spirit of rebellion and it came through the rock and roll music it came up and it changed the culture of the United States and the world forever and so we see now we come all the way up from the 50s and the 60s and now you see what we've got now it's a conglomeration of just oh my and now we've got the Millennials and the different ones and this is happening every generation I'm sure that is as you get older um everybody wants to blame the generation before them for all their problems now the young people say well it's because my daddy did this there was a movie that came out back in the 80s and I I saw it years ago back then but I went back and watched it a few years ago and it was called The Breakfast Club and on this movie every kid on that movie was mad at their mama and daddy and all they blamed all of their problems on everything that their dad had done or their mom had done and that was a spirit of the age and where that was coming up and now we've seen it in full manifestation and so that just tells you about where everybody's at where the where the um where the cultures at it's not taking responsibility for your own actions it's not it's not saying well I've done this so now I've got to pay the consequences no I did this but it's because it's your fault that I'm in this shape that I'm in now see that's the spirit of this age nobody wants to take um responsibility amen and we see how that it comes and the Satan comes in and waves but then as a wave comes in the wave will recede you'll have a tide of Communism and then the conservatives will come in and then it'll come back a little harder in the 60s then he'll go back out and all the while just like a wave on the beaches is washing out the foundation of a of a home out there or it's washing out the road or a bridge little by little wave after wave and it goes back and you say oh well that's one wave it's it's okay the bridge is still here I'm all right the house is still here but another wave comes in and then another wave will come in and now the very foundations of our nation are being attacked they've torn down statues well they had the low-hanging fruit that was easy to go after the Confederate sort of go after Stonewall Jackson or go after Robert E Lee and everybody's a whole yeah that's fine I don't have a problem with that but now they're going after Thomas Jefferson they're going after Abraham Lincoln they're going after George Washington the very foundations of the nation are being stripped out from under the people and and so now everybody's saying wait a minute hold on just a second but now see it's already in motion so what are you going to do about it see so folks they say well I've got an exit strategy I'm going to do this or I'm going to do that or we need a we need Donald Trump back in there or we need Ron DeSantis or we need JFK Jr or whoever he is I don't know Robert who is that some other Kennedy I don't know that's all we need is another one and everybody's looking for that to be the answer oh we need a savior we need a somebody to stand up and rescue us you know the Democrat the Republicans want a good uh a good retort you know the Democrats are always coming in with with a wave of of of some kind of liberalism or some kind of attack against against conservative values against the family against the home and what the conservatives want is they want a Superman politician who can stand and go toe-to-toe with them and get the media to finally get on their side it's never going to happen never going to happen but you know that's a smoke screen that Satan's got for the entire world brother Brandon all it is is communism brother bam said don't you worry about communism see while we're over here worried about uh who hit John or or whatever's going on over here and some kind of a new bill that they're coming out with and they're getting you all tore up and you're watching the news and and you're fighting your fingernails watching Tucker Carlson or biting your fingernails and watching Fox News oh what are we going to do what are we going to do is that they've got they're coming for the guns or well we know they are what are you getting all upset about prophets already said it why in the world are we worried about these things getting all upset about these things but while the whole world is biting their fingernails wondering what are we going to do Rome's over here sharpening up their knives see brother Ram said don't worry about communism worry about romanism well I don't worry about him he said watch them look out for him that purple Beast over there amen Scarlet Beast she's getting power again you don't think so you just look around for the first time in hundreds and hundreds of years Switzerland is no longer neutral they've always been neutral in every conflict always been neutral except for this one they're no longer neutral they they absolutely froze the bank accounts of Russia how many knows that that happened sure they've always touted us oh no we're out of it we're out of it hmm you know it's kind of a funny thing has anybody ever noticed their Swiss guards that guard the Vatican see there's a there's things that are going on in this world that the devil's got everybody running after this and he's got you running after that and it's right under you nose you're not even seeing it but I'm so God I'm glad that the unchangeable god has came to us in an unexpectable way amen we don't have to worry about these things my goodness how long have I been up here already somebody tell me what time I started anybody gone praise the Lord see that's what's the matter today reason our schools are letting down no ministers coming in see oh we don't need preachers anymore this is 1962. no ministers coming in young men interested we have needs some more of you praying fathers and mothers is what we need to make our schools fill up young men's Hearts burning with Zeal to take the gospel is what we need but things are changing see brother Brown said that we need young man whose hearts are on fire young man who's who's got a zeal for the gospel oh I would I would that every young man every young woman that would come in every person that would come in to this church on Wednesday night on Sunday morning but you would come for one purpose in one person one purpose alone and that was to come and worship our heavenly father I don't mean just show up right I don't mean half-heartedly clap your hands come and warm this seat for an hour and a half or two hours I don't mean coming and be entertained by the music or come and be entertained by What speaker is here but come with a purpose in your life oh my god brother Jason preached a sermon called prayer and purpose I love it everybody's seeking after happiness oh I just want to get happy I I have a right to be happy I have a right to I want something I want new clothes I want to go shopping to make me happy I want a new car you know I want to buy a boat and a truck to pull it with that'll make me happy everything that that everybody wants to be happy but in chasing after happiness you never find it chasing after happiness is like a mirage when the Pioneers were out on the desert and they were looking for water and they would see a mirage and they kept running after it and every time they go farther it's get a little farther away and that's the way happiness is in your life when you're chasing after it but I read a quote one time I thought it was wonderful and it said this that happiness is what you stumble over on your way to serving God that's the only true happiness you'll ever find in this world you might I think you're happy for a little while you get your little bit of money in your bank account you get a new car you get a new girlfriend you get a new boyfriend you get a new job you get a new house but that old house is going to crumble one day that boyfriend might break up with you your money's gonna go that's just a given see none of those things bring happiness I've seen and read about rock stars oh they were ambitious yet they were ambitious they've ran over everybody to get they would do everything they could to get that audition in front of that right producer and they got there and boy they were they had arrived then they had sold out concerts and 50s 60 and 70 and 80 000 people people just screaming just to get a a glimpse of them screaming to grab a hold of their clothes all right and absolutely took up a gun and blew their own brains out adored by the world everything at their fingertips they could have any person they wanted in a carnal way they could have anything that they want any car any house any vacation but when they got to the top of this great Mountain that Satan had up there for him when they reached to the top of it they realize there's nothing there nothing but emptiness nothing but sadness is this all that there is when they get there and they'll die they'll try to quiet that that that thirst that God put in them yes they have a thirst every man woman and child born has a thirst but we'll set him we'll we'll quiz that thirst with the things of the world rock stars will do it with drugs and they'll start saying oh I need something I need a new drug that was a drug a song back out in the 80s or 70s I need a new drug one of them won't make me feel too high one of them won't make me feel too low yeah need a new drug I'm so glad I found a drug one day oh I don't need no narcotic [Music] I drunk from that Fountain and there's something about it there's something about drinking one time from that Fountain you'll never thirst again you'll never thirst for the things of the world you'll thirst for more of God your thirst oh it makes a thirst in you that you won't be satisfied until you've got more of him don't try to quench that thirst for the things of this world it'll never work it'll only bring you heartache and sorrow that's what the world says chase after this chase after that little bit just a little bit farther until you're running all the way I saw I believe it was a image one time of a man chasing the dollar and he and it and he kept running and he got a hold and finally there was a grave and he fell right in the grave chasing the almighty dollar what's your God tonight see watching TV watching movies let me tell you something I read this a long time ago television makes you want things you can't have and it makes you dissatisfied with what you do have think about it let me say that again it makes you want things you can't have and dissatisfied with what you do have if you're married if you're a man and you got a wife and you see a beautiful woman on there and she's seductive it'll cause a man to want that covetousness if a woman sees a man on there come on now y'all with me help me preach tonight amen if a woman sees a man on there and he's handsome he's clean cut oh he carries a bouquet and comes in the door on the Hallmark Channel it's always at Christmas time and it's and as always on a horse farm somewhere and his name is Gage or Luke or something like that oh but he's romantic see just like the devil was to Eve romantic you see what that does that makes that woman dissatisfied with her husband it makes her want what she can't have and the man well he's just dumb you know we're dumb anyway because all we gotta do is see something and that's it you don't have to hear nothing you don't have to no no a man is attracted by what he sees and we know that that's why it's so important young girls young ladies young women to be conscious of what you're wearing always remember that because we are made different men and women are made different women are attracted by a lot of times what they hear and and they and they're attracted to that but men are made different we're we are it's just a fact of of nature and so you've got to be conscious is your shirt too tight across the top is your skirt too tight you might have a skirt on but brother Brown said all these Pentecostal women with these dresses on it look like skin down wieners now that's what he said now what he meant by that was it's so tight you can't even tell where the where the the skin of the wiener starts and the wiener starts and that's about the size of it and you get a drink of water on them oh my God if you got a dime in your back pocket I don't want to be able to read the date on it but that's the spirit of this age you see him out in in yoga pants I'll guarantee you eight probably one percent of them doing yoga but they out there in them yoga pants for everybody to see and you ain't even got to even think about leave nothing to the imagination it don't even leave a thought left you gotta turn your head going into the store we don't have to we don't want to do that in the Church of God all we ought to look different we don't want to even ever get close to the world look nothing like the world all that all that I wouldn't care laugh at me mock me call me a Holy Roller call me whatever you want to comment and you don't have to dress out of an antique box brother Bram said you don't but you can dress modest ain't nothing wrong with that wear that badge I told the sisters up at the other church I said you sisters have a y'all have a wonderful opportunity people can see you in your long dress and your long hair and they immediately know your holiness they gotta hear us talk for a little while don't they most of us some of us the jury's still out on when you hear them talk because all it's about is Nascar or it's about this or about that and if you tied them down you might get them to admit that they're a Christian let our conversations be holy let our dress be holy oh God let our thoughts be holy I love what brother Jason said Sunday what his daddy told him any evil thought you bring that thing before the Holy Ghost and let him kill it I did that this week I told Brother Jason back in the study I've done it probably 10 times already and a thought well come in you know what I would do I would picture that thought as an old greasy hobo I don't know why poor hobo but just an old grimy nasty looking something and he and he comes up and I put handcuffs on him Paul said take that thing into captivity I'm putting handcuffs of the of the of the word of God on that thing and in my mind I'm leading it up here I'll say come on you coming with me and there's this jail cell over here and then that cell is a pillar of fire of the Holy Ghost and I put that thing in that cell brothers and sisters that thing is gone do that try it one time and see what happens bring it to the Holy Ghost and let him burn it out to make that concerted effort in your heart burn it out I don't want none of that in my heart only thing that's waiting for the Rapture is the Readiness of the church you say oh you're preaching clothesline you're preaching this I believe in holiness [Applause] we ought to all believe in holiness God is a holy God and he's going to have a holy church she won't have one spot or wrinkle she's not going to have a stitch of the world she's not going to have any of the suit of Hell upon her none of it she's going to be a spotless bride well we know we need to know what time it is because there's one thing that when a bride's getting ready there's one thing she's looking at the Bridesmaids are here it's fine all the other ones here but there's one thing she's looking at is that clock she's waiting waiting for time to go out and be married to her groom we need to know what time it is so already I believe it's already it's already almost midnight I think the second hand's already almost hit there in a minute it's just one one click away nations are breaking as brother Brandon would say many times Israel's Awakening the signs that the prophet's foretold we're at the end it's time to quit playing Church oh my let me get one more Amen on that one time to quit playing Church kind of get down to the brass tacks brother Brown I'm tired on the way back how do we go back it ain't some Doctrine it ain't some Dogma it ain't some Creed we got to have that love in our heart for our brothers and sisters amen amen well I've got one quote read already oh my this is gonna be one for the record books here but God he cannot change his decisions he cannot change it therefore if God's attitude toward one Sinner and wanted to repent Adam and Eve God made a way for them to repent and he forgave that Sinner and the next sinner comes God has got to do the same thing to that sinner or he did it wrong when he acted with the first sinner if a man was sick and God healed one man and then if ever another man comes to God he's got to do the same thing or he did it wrong when he healed the first one if he comes on the same ground what a resting place then for the soul that's seeking are you seeking him tonight we've got a resting place it's the unchangeable god it's not politics it's not money it's not any of these things out there it ain't even your brother and your sister that they'll make mistakes it ain't brother Jason he's he's he can fall just like anybody else but get your eyes on Jesus Christ amen the unchanging God sometimes it comes in unexpected ways The ecumenical World thought that he was going to come in in one of their denominations maybe maybe the Baptist thought he was going to rise up or the methodists or with a with a uh messenger that Wesley had or the Baptist that John Smith or or Campbell had see but he ain't coming any of those ways now I'm so glad that he came just like he did oh a little uneducated man from the middle of the country way back up in the woods I tell you what the world don't want him but I'll take him well I want a part of him but I'll take him I believe this message I believe is absolutely a perfect message 47 to 65. oh mama here's a promise too that we can think if he the one that said that has brought every word to pass then he's going to have a church to appear before him without a spotter wrinkle and it's going to behoove us brother sister to really be sure that we are right with God and then because there's going to be a church and we want to be part of that church amen that's the unchanging God hey man we want to be part of that church don't we I don't want to be a part of the church if anything goes I don't want to be as part of the Church of well we're known for our great music or we're known because we have a wonderful speaker and he just keeps your attention all the time but I want to be known oh brother Bram talked about a church out in I believe it's somewhere out in California maybe San Jose called the old Powerhouse is what he called it he said that that they were really praying people oh they were they he said that he came in one time and his wife was with him and they were singing a song and he heard it sounded like somebody was singing above them and it was angels well if he asked the brother afterwards the pastor of Church he said I sounded something High train voices and the brother said oh brother Brown that happens here often said that that they would come in and they would pray all night seeking God and then and that and that was like I believe that was a window of Heaven that was open in that little place oh I wish that Bethel Tabernacle was like that I want the world to say write about Bethel Tabernacle in Beaufort South Carolina it might have been a little but it was a Powerhouse why it wasn't nothing to do with the four walls wasn't nothing to do the lighting or the sound but it was a living God living in the people they came to church expecting something and wouldn't leave until they got it a lot of times we don't stay long enough we don't pray long enough we get out for just a little while and brother random saying when you get down and you start feeling the phone starts ringing or this starts happening or the or he said the birds will aggravate me or the stickers will stick me he said hold on he said God's getting ready to do something he comes in unexpected ways sometimes you don't know we think oh he's going to come in a Revival glory be to God but it might be on Monday morning it might be uh when you're doing your laundry sisters or brothers or you might be when you're on the road somewhere and you put on a tape or maybe you start thinking about something to happen or you're on the phone with another brother or another sister or something and something comes and oh praise be to God that Revelation strikes your heart I've been going down the road and just about stomped a hole in my floorboard before they say as a crazy man over there just leave me alone I'll be crazy I tell you what I hope the world calls me crazy because if they think I'm like them oh I'm in trouble I don't want to look nothing like them do you oh my God now we don't have to be odd but you'll be odd you don't have to make yourself odd you just get in love with him get it all over you don't worry about what this one says don't worry about what you're the person beside of you says but just get it all over you amen all right getting ready to close here I mean it now let's take Jacob now you remember okay now you must remember also that when God answers sometimes it's in an unexpected way he's unchangeable but he does things in unexpected ways let's take Jacob Jacob was running he got caught between two fires now he was going home and Laban his father-in-law was coming this way after him because his wife had stole their gods and then he finds out that Esau is coming this way after his brother who he had cheated now that was quite an unexpected time for God to visit him you thought it would have been in the middle of a Revival or something oh no it was in the middle of the one of the hardest times of his life sometimes God brings us down right down to the river he'll bring us right down to the very brink of it I've been there I felt like everything was going to fall apart I and just oh I've been I've I've tasted of this heavenly gift long enough to know that when everything looks like he's about to bust wide open it is God's getting ready to Break Forth on you you just hold home just a little bit longer don't you worry about it I've seen it too many times I've said the devil said oh it's time to give a whole no devil it's just time now you say give up I ain't giving up I ain't turning around by the grace of God I'll wear a shining Crown someday not turning round but oh he'll get you he'll get you your somebody make the boss mad at you he'll get this man he'll the dishwasher'll break the sewer is going to back up something's going to happen the car is going to break down something's going to happen and then oh it's terminal and you just feel it pressing just hold on God's fixing to do something the devil knows it I don't know how he knows it but he knows it and he tries every way he can to cut that off from you he tried with he tried with Jacob but Jacob found him a little spot he got over and all of a sudden the man came to him he started wrestling with that man that man was none other than God himself wrestle with that angel all night in the angel of the Lord and it got it was all coming on the morning it was the darkest time of the night but the sun started coming up see we're in the dark time right now and let me tell you something brother Brandon said this he said what causes it to get so dark he said it's the light that's pressing the darkness and what is it the light of God is coming let me tell you something brothers and sisters the light of God is in you you and I are causing this Darkness out there you say Brothers how in the world think about it God in you living in you written Epistles rid of all men the light of God in this Earth the only light that God has is you they're not they're not out there in that communical world they've got their Creeds they've got their dogmas they've got their organizations their denominations but it's in this little bride that's where he's tabernacled his kingdom is you you are his kingdom and that light is pressing the darkness now the light's coming the son of man is coming he's coming one of these days he's going to break the Eastern sky is that right now let me tell you say well what does it have to do with me how does Jacob wrestling a angel have to think about it that was his flesh wrestling with God your flesh every day you've got to wrestle with this word you've got to work out your own salvation you've got to wrestle with it you might have to get down it may have to take everything out of you but somehow or another you've got to let that word overcome you it's got to overcome this flesh you've got to let it overcome somehow you've got to die just like brother Jason said about uh Sampson when he finally gave up when he finally quit fighting and he and was ready to die that's you and I we've got to die out to our own thoughts we've got to die our outs our own ideas and let the word of God and the life of God come and live in US we've got to wrestle it out it's getting dark oh but the sun's coming up it's coming up any day now one of these mornings I was talking to brother Jack the other day brother Jack guess God bless you brother Jack I don't know which camera's on he's watching we got to talking about the resurrection I said oh brother Jack one of these mornings it's going to be real I know we talk about it now but one day we might hear a knock at the door we might be doing something we might be going down the road you might you're going to hear a voice one day it's going to be familiar hey man I believe that I got a quote that brother Branham said this I sent it to brother Jack you want me to read it to you say slow down a minute brother Joe you're running ahead of yourself let me see if I can find it here we go this is what brother Branham said he said oh the same holy spirit that saved the lutherans at that Sanctified the Methodist and baptized the Pentecostals is Now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus when it'll be so powerful think about it it'll be so powerful the Holy Ghost living in you living in this church it'll be so powerful that'll draw the rest of them from the grave there will be a resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost is for what is the Holy Ghost without us they cannot be made perfect they lived in one day under that we live in another day think about it friends power of God is going to be so perfect perfectly living in you no no tarnish of the world no Doctrine nothing like that it's going to be an absolute perfect spotless church just like the first church right back to the Ephesian Church all the way back to a perfect church and the Holy Ghost is going to be so powerful think about it the Holy Ghost on this Earth will be so powerful that the dead Saints won't even be able to stay in the grave brother bam said it'll draw him from the grave the Holy Ghost where living in you living in me oh my we've got to get to that place if it hairlips everything I don't care what it does if it if it tears a heart off of me if it skins me down Lord let it do it if he has to get home to me for my dress and get on to me for putting a little bit of brother Rim Top by that pancake makeup and he got it talking about that and had to paint the woman said she did it to cover up pimples but then she said that she came to brother Brandon she said brother random I heard what she said she said I washed it off he said praise God sister now you're close to the kingdom of heaven you say oh I got pimples just let them shine who cares I'd rather get the Applause of God than the admiration is somebody out there cares about a pimple or an acne scar do what the prophet said oh my I'm sorry is that all right I don't want to know part of the world I don't want to look like the world I don't want to dress like the world the Hebrew children I'm just about to close now they were caught in quite a predicament too they were caught in an unexpected place where they met God for God to come to them in a fiery furnace unexpected time and an unexpected way but God is the unchangeable unchangeable God and he does things that way in unexpectable place unexpectable time amen you want to talk about it they said oh we're not going to serve your gods and God is able to deliver us but nevertheless we're not going to serve your gods what are you think you get right down to the very end of it God will meet you there every time he'll do it I've been there so many times I don't care what the devil's got in front of me what he what he's reminds me of my past whatever he's saying and he's trying to get me to knock me off the trail I'm not turning around I'm going to keep pressing on moving on why I've got a promise amen we've got that promise I'll think about Jesus how when he had the burdens he said here and Jesus was here confronting the greatest test that he ever had and guess how many ain't none of us had a Gethsemane yet lay just before him where that once and final all sufficient tests must come when the burdens of the entire world laid upon his blessed shoulder there was no one in all Heavens or Earth could ever stood it but him and to know that all of the sins of past sins and present sins and future sins rested upon this decision and it was one of the most greatest victories that Christ ever won or proved his great messiahship as when he said to God not my will thine be done that was the greatest Victory he had ever won all the Demons of Torment was around to tempt him and try him oh my how can can we truly say that in our heart Lord not my will but thine be done I wanna I want that to be in my life I don't want my will to overcome but Jesus promised that he'd send the Holy Ghost he said I'll send the comforter to you I want to tell you what the performance is here it talks about the performance God's going to perform this it's the execution of an action it's something accomplished the Fulfillment of a claim promise or a request if you believe it God's going to perform it in your life he said on the day at Pentecost this promise promise is unto you and your children and to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call brothers and sisters that promise is still good tonight if you say brother brother Joe I've I believe I've accepted the Lord I maybe I'll I've received that justification I'm gonna tell you what justification is let me give you a real easy definition of it I was I I used to drive a truck and I was I had had electronic logs and and I went I forgot to go off duty and in electronic logs if you don't go off duty when you get up in the morning you've been on duty the whole time you were supposed to be off duty and you can't drive you can't go anywhere out there I was it was a mistake I didn't mean to do it see but I got up the next morning and I'm like I can't drive I can't go because the truck was locked you couldn't move it so I had to get on I had to call I had to make a a plea for help I was stuck I couldn't go nowhere and that's just how the devil's got you brothers and sisters he got you in a trap one time a mistake no phone if you're wrong he put that on you let me tell you something God's gonna put it right back on top of him when you repent and you've come to him and I said Lord he'll take it right away so I got the true definition of justification when I called that little lady and she said oh hang on just a minute she a little click of a button and just like that it was as though I had never done it oh my just that easy it's just that easy just as though I never even done it no record of it can't find it nobody could ever find it if you search all of the databases you would never find it it's not there and that's the same as your sin tonight no matter what the devil's trying to tell you is gone it's gone it can't be found they say some people say oh well God knows everything how can he I can remember how come God I don't care what you can remember the Bible says he can't remember we're finite he's infinite he has the ability to absolutely wipe it from record never happened what sins are you talking about Lord forgive me for what what sin there is no sin don't let the devil keep putting that on you day after day say oh I'm just trying to be humble don't be so humble that you walk over the blood of what it's done for you and never fully accept that great pardon that he's given to you I've had people that that would tell me I don't want to go up in communion I I just I don't feel like I'm I'm worthy no you ain't and you won't never be worthy I'll never be worthy nobody's ever going to be worthy I just oh you don't know what I've done no I don't know what you've done I don't care what you've done but I know what he did why don't you start looking at what he did and quit looking at what you've done [Applause] and walk up there with boldness and say Lord I know I'm I'm just a sinner but God I'm taking you with your word I've repented I believe oh God that you have taken my sins and threw them into the sea of forgetfulness now I'm walking up here by faith how are you saved you ain't saved by some book you're not saved by Church attendance you're not saved by him but but by the grace of God through faith you've got to take it by faith I said God I'm walking up there I know I'm nothing nothing in my hands I bring but oh God simply to the cross I cling and come boldly then and say oh Dell you get behind me I'm walking up there why because he said I'm forgiven he's saying my sins are gone I'm not listening to you anymore then move on walk on go you got Justified now let's walk on into sanctification let's just keep walking don't stop there don't stop until you get all the way up to the Holy Ghost and then oh my it's just miles brother random set up sky blue while we're seated in Heavenly places then in Christ Jesus hey man I was when I left Flagstaff the other day I remember hearing brother Tim uh I can't think of his name Pruitt yes the one and only and so brother y'all laugh when you get up here it's a different place I couldn't even think of

thinking about that and that was the highest mountain in Arizona is right there right there by outside the motel and like 12 000 something feet and as I flew I got on that jet plane and I was looking

even prayed for her but she just took God at his word and believed and she got her healing amen amen anybody gotta take come on somebody got a testimony there you go so about a week ago I went up to Jeffersonville and it was certainly a blessing to be up there I had never been in the past and just listening to the tapes and whatnot of the prophet and the certain locations that he had been and visited and just his hometown up there and just being up there you could certainly feel the anointing up there and just how incredible certain events you can imagine them there and it was certainly a blessing to be up there I met a couple Brothers up there that I have never met before and bless them thank you Lord it's just it's incredible what God is doing and not just eternally thankful certainly thinking this is so um this was last night we were actually getting we had just finished dinner and we were we usually we have this routine where Hazel falls asleep in bed with us and then we take her to her crib well last night John was like you know she seems really really tired I'm going to go ahead and put her in her crib and let her go to sleep on her own so while he was in there getting her down I was in the kitchen and I had made some applesauce and that day and I needed to put it in a cat in a container and some of y'all been in my house now so the there's a cabinet that's to the left of our sink and up on the very top it has some Pyrex glass bowls and they're all stacked within each other and so I thought well I'll just pull those out and I usually don't have a problem
