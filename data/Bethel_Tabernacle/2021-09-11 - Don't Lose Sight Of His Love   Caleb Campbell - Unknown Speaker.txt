here uh i was talking to a friend yesterday he told him i was coming to preach tonight he had a conversation about the lord and then later on that night he was like so what i was like well the love of the lord he's like is there anything else you like to talk about not really honestly so friends if you all just want to turn in your bibles with me we're going to start with um mark the 12th chapter and the 28th verse we're going to take a subject tonight don't lose sight of his love amen don't lose sight of his love mark 12 and verse 28 just want to say amen when you have it amen and one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is like this namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than this amen uh we got one more uh chapter we're gonna read out of if we're gonna turn with me in your bibles to first corinthians the 13th chapter there's about 13 verses we're going to read through them all and then take our seats amen is a familiar familiar scripture reading it says though i speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity i am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long and is kind charity envious not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up doth not behave itself unslamly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things and endureth all things for charity never faileth but whether there will be prophecies they shall fail whether they be tongues they shall they shall cease whether they'll be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i speak as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away my childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known and now by to faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is charity let's just bow our heads friends dear precious heavenly father lord we just approach your throne of grace and mercy tonight father we're lord just humbled to be here tonight father we're so happy to be lord just able to gather together lord god in the congregation father god just we just ask that your presence can just descend down now for just a few moments that you can feel welcome here lord as we talk about your love father god i just pray lord i have these notes i have lord these ideas i have these thoughts but lord i laid all that aside father god so that you can come and have preeminence here father lord so that you can move and lord so that we can just speak to the people lord god i pray that you would speak to their hearts i pray that you would speak to my heart father god lord we just surrender ourselves to you and we ask it all in the name of jesus christ amen amen you can have your seats friends i just want to talk about don't lose sight of his love i just want to talk a little bit about how this thought came to me one night while i was i was at work and i was listening to a portion of a sermon on a youtube and the holy spirit just started witnessing to me and man don't you just love it when that happens when you can just set your side of self set yourself aside and just bask in his presence for a few minutes and just listen to a tape or listen to some worship music or just listen to just something soothing and and his presence just descends down it amazes me friends when we can really shut out the world to open up that channel with the holy spirit miracles really take place you asked me what miracle took place that night a divine presence a divine presence that is in a perfect place spoke to me through his spirit that allowed me to house him his spirit in my earthly body friends when we all have that gift how much more miraculous can it get i just want to talk a little bit about the pathway to love and loving one towards another um some bullet points here you know having revelation you know it's it's important getting in line with the right doctrine is important good works are important these things are all what the scripture teaches to have having all these attributes are key to being christians but having the key element of of it all is the most important and there's no greater commandment than it than to love amen to love our our god to love one another in mark 12 we talked about that and without gaining that love in our hearts we will never to be we will never be able to step into our true positions in christ unlocking that that key element amen you want to turn in your your bibles with me to matthew 18 and verse 18. we're going to start with the king james version but i wanted to read a few versions of this the lord really spoke to me through matthew 18 and verse 18 verily say verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done of them of my father which is in heaven for where there are two or three gathered together in my name there i am in the midst of them amen in another translation i i read and there's going to be two we're going to read out of the message translation and the esv but they both really spoke to me matthew 18 and verse 19 and the esv says and again i say this to you if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask it will be done for them by my father in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there i am among you there i am among them amen friends so we have we're this is a key element we're god is giving us a chance he he's giving us an ability to when we bind together when we come together and we take away everything else ourselves we lay everything else aside and we just love one another we love him then everything else can come and and and and be made whole amen in the message translation um it says take this most seriously this is this is probably my favorite my favorite translation when it comes to this scripture it says take this most seriously a yes on earth is yes in heaven and a no on earth is no in heaven what you say to one another is eternal i mean this when two of you get together on anything at all on earth and make prayer of it my father in heaven goes into action amen friends isn't that beautiful when when two of us get together on earth and pray and make prayer of it my father in heaven goes into action and then when two or three of you are gathered together because of me you can be sure that i'll be there friends so we can be sure tonight that he's here because more than two of us are gathered together in his name amen to freely forgive in matthew 18 21-22 to freely forgive is the practice of christ's mercy and love amen it's what he teaches us it's the way it's the way of his love is to freely forgive it's what it's what he did for us when we were dead in our sins in trespasses he he forgave us amen in in the next verses in uh matthew 18 it there's a story that talks a little bit about forgiveness just going to read through this story for for just a moment and it says then peter came into him and said lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him till seven times and jesus saith unto him i say unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king which would take account of his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was bought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents but for as much as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and his children and all that he had and payment to be made the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying lord have patience with me and i will pay thee all then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him of the debt but that same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants which owed him a hundred pence and he laid hands on him and he took him by the throat saying pay me the what thou owest and his fellow servants fell down his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and i will pay thee and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay his debt so when his fellow servants saw what was done they were they were very sorry and came and told their lord that was done then his lord after that he had called him said unto him o thou wicked servant i forgave thee all thy debt because thou has desired us me should it thou not also have compassion on thy fellow servant even as i had pity on thee and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors thank you till he should pay all that was due unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother his trespasses amen friends so we see here that just the lord tells a parable how you know this this king he had he had a debt and and he forgave this debt the servant he forgave this debt but then he had people underneath him who also had a debt but he didn't forgive he didn't freely forgive the way that he was freely forgiven so sometimes friends you know we we can think about you know how the lord freely forgives us you know we were dead i mean i'm the greatest center of them all amen like we were we were dead in our sins and trespasses and he forgave us we all the way this step into the position that he wants us to is that we need to freely forgive just like he did amen we're unlocking something with this scripture amen god starts with a what if two of you get together on anything at all and make a prayer of it my father will go into action so that we have we have the substance of what we need to do we need to bind together we need to go together in prayer but how are we going to do that the only way to be able to do that to bind together is to is to loose everything else he finishes with the how and remember back to our opening text we were talking about the most important commandment which is love your neighbor have grace and have mercy on those who who makes mistakes it struck a thought to me that the more mature we can get in christ the more often we are to freely forgive someone of a wrong yes amen why is that because we have been in that person's shoes so many times we have myself i have been in that place so many times where i have stepped out of the line of grace or i've stepped out of of the line of his will and he's offered up his grace so freely amen we've stepped out or you know we've done wrong to somebody and you know we feel so bad about it we we you know we did a wrong to a brother or a sister or you know a friend or a family member and you know maybe we meant to do it maybe we didn't mean to do it but we feel so we feel so bad about it we we we step into that place um we we know that remorse amen we know what that feels like we walked a mile in those people's shoes and those in that person's shoes we can't lose sight friends of his love i broke down thinking about something just while i was at work that night i was just thinking to the lord and just praising him and thinking about what he's done for me in my life and i started thinking about back to my personal testimony about how he saved me i was just i was just a no-good rotten individual still in but by his grace i'm here amen and i remember when i gave my heart to the lord i hadn't completely fully surrendered yet i i i gave him part of me amen sometimes we can get to that place where we give him part of us amen i gave him part of me i just told him i'd give up the things that i that i that were that were hurting me i was in that i was in that phase where i didn't i didn't like the pain that i was around and i didn't i knew that something was happening and i was scared for myself so i had i had stepped halfway into into giving him myself he i wanted him to be my savior but i didn't i wasn't sure about him being my lord yet amen we all have that sometimes amen friends we want him to be our savior but sometimes it's hard for him to be our lord to be the lord of our life and i wasn't i wasn't completely there yet he was working on my heart continually working on my heart and i remember being at home one day and i just was having all kinds of physical issues emotional issues spiritual issues all kinds of things just going on in my mind and in my heart and in my life and i remember coming home and i hadn't asked for this in a really long time and if if since i was a young kid and i just asked my i went up to my parents they were they were just in their bedroom and i just asked i was like well you just will you guys pray with me i just was broken down in my spirit and i just i needed prayer and i knew that those were two people that i could turn to for that i knew that there was a solace place to go to amen so i went to them for prayer and what had happened friends is in first john 4 18 we don't have to turn to it but it says it it says because fear the second part of the verse it says because fear hath torment and he that feareth is not made perfect in love amen i was in torment friends we have all been in that place in torment in our hearts and in our lives and in our in our beings where we're in torment we're we the lord is working on us and maybe we we need to step into what we need to do and whatever it may be whatever it is that you're you're fighting whatever your spiritual battle is amen but when that force overtakes you there's something there's something there's a there's a gateway god god sends a gateway he sends he sends it there's a path to get out of it amen and i remember laying in my bed nights i would lay in my bed weeks on end and i would just i was thinking that this was going to be the yet for me the end for me i just my heart was racing and nights my mom would come in and she would just she would just pray with me amen she would just pray over me she would pray with me and it was just it was something that that i needed the lord was really working on me really dealing with me fear had overtaken me the first part of that chapter first part of that verse it says that there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear amen friends what was happening i was in torment because of fear but his love because his love wasn't in me yet amen i hadn't surrendered fully to him yet amen but there was someone close to me my mom who knew full well with that first part of that scripture all i knew was the worldly part of that scripture where fear had overtaken me but she knew the first part that there is no fear and love because perfect love casted out fear amen and in that scripture it says beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god amen i'm just going to build up to something here friends here in his love that not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if god so loved us we all we ought also to love one another no man has seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us amen hereby we know that we dwell in him and he and us because he hath given us of his spirit and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world and whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he and god and we have known and believed the love that god hath in us for god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him and herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment skip down to verse 18 for verse 19. we love him because he first loved us it's in moments like these where i was sitting in my sitting in my place of work and and a miracle took place where i consider myself and each one of us here tonight a living walking breathing talking miracle amen he gave us a chance he forgave us because he was crushed for our iniquities and he was wounded for our transgressions we each one have our testimonies that we've gone through in our life that we we build upon our relationship with the lord with because each step we take in our lives we can look back on the love that jesus had for us through the air through the air of of ourselves and he can still have a relationship with us because he wanted to one thing that we need to do is we can't lose sight of those times in your life where god's love was projected amen that was a time in my life where god's love was was projected to me i was sitting in my living room one day a couple weeks ago while i was studying this thought and jesus just allowed his his sweet presence just to descend down in the room and i just was typing on the computer and i just started to cry just it was just his presence just does that to you friends just was reminded of his never failing love in my heart i can think so often times we can get so distracted in our life our jobs our families our cars our homes our everything our school our phones that we lose the connection that we're supposed to have with the lord amen our love story doesn't stop the day that we surrender to him in fact that is just the beginning friends our love story with him is something for the ages he has an entire he has an entire love story written out for us and when we study the scriptures we can see god's divine plan we realize that love is projected to us and almost more importantly it is projected through us amen he wants his love to project through us completely and that is when the impossible becomes possible in our lives that's when our lives are changed and if we can keep our eyes fixed to that then all else will fall directly where it's supposed to be amen i just have a quote i wanted to read from 1951 the works that i do bear witness with me it says that after all i'd rather have the love of god sealed in my heart than all the gifts there is in the bible that's right i thought of that here just a few nights ago my little girl called me i told her she wanted me to come home to her she loves me oh she told me that i sent i told her i sent her a little doll but she didn't want the doll she said i want you daddy not your doll she wants me that's the way i think of jesus amen i love his gifts and things to help his people but i want jesus the love of god sealed in your hearts pressed in until the world's pressed out and you see nothing but the lord to love him as you love one another you love the lord if you don't love one another you can't love the lord he said so that's right and god can't move you so friends that's my that's my main thought tonight i want to tell i want to take and look at this you if you can't love one another you can't love the lord amen that's right god can't move into you there's there's this quote that he talks about and we're all familiar with the story it's the maniac that was out there in washington and he ran to the platform he was a big big grizzly man he was 260 70 pounds and he was crazy and he had done this before he had broken into different ministers uh platforms and and he had actually been in the insane asylum for for punching out actually another minister and he was in this he was in brother branham's meeting and uh he said he said i weighed about 128 pounds and he the guy ran up to him and said i was going to break every bone in your body and the police and the ministers fled away and i was left on the platform with the maniac and something happened and the maniac stood like that his teeth set together his eyes snake in the grass he said you snake in the grass up here pretending to be a man of god said i'll show you how much man of god you are i'll break every bone of your body and he drew back his big fist and he was well able physically to carry out this threat but something happened instead of despising this man hey man this is this is a great friend something happened instead of despising this man i felt sorry for him i thought you poor man you wouldn't treat me that way why you're just a man like i am you wasn't made to act like that you were made to love you were made to be a father of children to love them and to love all man you were made to be a son of god but the devil has taken a hold of you and i feel sorry for you amen what was the prophet doing in that time in that moment of time he was tapping into first john 4 18 where it says that perfect love casteth out fear amen he wasn't up there on the platform scared he wasn't up there you know trembling in fear perfect love had casted that out he knew that god was gonna take care of him no matter what amen he was tapping into mark 12 and verse 30 and 31 where there is no greater love than this and that's to love those who hate you love your neighbors and love god and project that love amen and he said he walked up close to me and brother brandon making that sound he spit in my face and i looked at him oh what happened with witch doctors and everything don't worry if god's with you who can be against you so so i looked the man i thought poor man i love you my poor lost brother never said a word and he walked up to me and raised his big fist back and the crowd setting breathless six thousand inside there pretty near that man standing in the rain he drew his fist back he had just struck a preacher like i was saying he was out of the insane institution he might ask the police there that was on the record to date and hit him he hit a minister and he broke his jaw on his collarbone he ran in there ran to the platform said i'm going to break every bone in your body and i looked at him not with hatred but with love and as he did and started towards me something inside of me said but tonight you'll fall over my feet fall over your feet he said i'll show you snake in the grass whose feet all fall over and he ran to me threw his fist back to strike me and i said satan come out of that man and his eyes set his head went back and he fell and pinned my feet to the floor the police had to roll him off oh friends that's it love amen when divine love is projected sovereign grace takes its place friends i wanna i want you guys to just look at this thought for a moment just step back and kind of getting ahead of myself here a little bit but we're just talking about love tonight and not losing sight of it and how how to step into the position that we're supposed to to be able to do the things that we're supposed to be do as believers as christians that we're supposed to do we have to surrender ourselves completely to christ which we did at one point but we have to keep surrendering ourselves as a in our daily walk in our daily self we in first corinthians paul talks about it says that he doesn't die once a week or once a month or once a year it says that i die daily and he uses that in the singular pronoun where it says that i am dying daily amen friends he dies daily that's what we're supposed to do we we're supposed to die daily so that god's love can enter into us and that we can project it to others amen that's what brother random was tapping into there and that's what so many prophets and teachers in the bible they tap into and we as christians as believers in this end time is what we're supposed to be able to tap into that's that's the main the capstone is what i've been reading the statue of a perfect man is this capstone is love we have to project that love to one another amen in in uh the book of acts the seventh chapter we're just gonna look at uh if you guys want to turn with me in the seventh chapter of verse 55 we're gonna look at just steven here amen and when they heard these things they were cut to their heart and they gnashed on their teeth gnashed on him with their teeth but he being full of the holy ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god and said behold i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of god then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran up upon him with one accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him amen and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was saul and they stoned see stephen calling upon god saying lord jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled down in his last moments in his last in his last breath he didn't curse them he didn't say why why why are you doing this to me he didn't he didn't do any of those things friends he kneeled down and he cried with a loud voice saying lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep amen friends he projected that love to them he didn't want to see he's he's received the gift of the holy ghost he received the gift of god he received god and he had his love inside of him and he was projecting that love to these people nobody when we when we are able to receive that gift of love from god that should be our main goal to give it out to others amen friends no matter no no barrier should break it break that down amen the bible is for our molding and just like to take these stories and take what we hear and just apply it to our lives amen in uh in john chapter 13 chapter 13 and verse 34 it says a new commandment i give unto you that you love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another and by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have loved one towards another amen friends that's that's what it that's what god is trying to get us to see this is how we are to be known as disciples to show love one another even when they don't deserve it we can't lose sight of that we we we remember i talked about a couple times ago last time i spoke up here about how we can't live in our our past experience we have to have our an experience every day and we can never lose sight of what god did for us and we are to be able to project that to others amen project what god did to us for others it breaks down barriers to move us forward to that higher calling in heavenly places paul said in first corinthians 13 it says though i speak with the tongue of men and angels though i have discernment though i have gifts to feed i take all my goods to feed the poor though i can move mountains with faith though i have knowledge to understand all things i am nothing till love comes in which is grace god has to do it you can do all these things and still be lost amen it's grace that saves you god's grace to the human race i think sometimes we can lose sight of his plan for us we can lose sight of his love i was just sitting there and i just was thinking about what he did for me and how that i can be a better testimony how that i can be a better witness how that i can project that love to all those people that i see on a daily basis and i just i was just praying my prayer was lord just lord help me step into that and help me just be who you want me to be who you've called me to be help me to take these scriptures and apply it to my life help me to be like stephen help me to be like these characters in the bible so that i can so that i can project your love so that because these things there's so many things in this in these scriptures that are important but it but in first corinthians 13 we looked at it it says if we don't have love then all those other things that we may possess those characteristics of christ then they don't they don't matter those nothing matters without god's love amen we're gonna we're gonna uh kind of take a little turn here and talk about talk about enoch and in hebrews in hebrews 11 it says by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death hebrews 11 5 he was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god friends i just was reading that scripture and i was like oh man i want to do that lord i want to be pleasing to you you know and as believers in this last day we're supposed to be types of enoch because we're going to be called up into a rapture amen but the only way that we're going to be able to do that is we're going to have to apply these words to our life amen we apply everything in this book to us but it says that the most important thing that we have to apply in our lives is his love we have to project his love we have to and how do we do that how do we have the testimony to please god like enoch had how do we how do we get to the place where god wants us to be amen friends he was translated because we please god can we say that we're supposed to friends we're supposed to get prepared for the rapture amen that's worse there's nothing else now except for his return amen so to get us to that place god has called us god has a plan for that it says this is from 1960 says he didn't displease him what the lord said do enoch done it now he was a type remember the ark is the type of jews the 144 thousand which is noah and his bunch but enoch went home just a little bit before the flood you know that so enoch kept just walking in the light so one day he felt his feet getting his he felt his feet getting off the ground he just kept walking he walked into glory without even dying that's right amen god took him away because he wasn't he was walking in the light with a testimony that he walked in the light of god amen he kept walking let's get our walking shoes on church let's get our walking shoes on to come where the and keep walking in the light in the beautiful light if we can step back for just a moment and we apply these things to our lives and we look back and we say lord i have to be like enoch so that you can come and and you can translate me up there so how do i get to that place father god how do i how do i project your love how do i do these things how do i we we have these we have all these these uh we have all these scriptures to do it we have to let the world around us just completely fade away amen and i was just i was i was sitting there and i was i was just crying i was just weeping because when he died for me when he when he did that 2000 years ago and and he called me back from it he called me back from my life of sin and from my life of transgression and from my life of of wrong the world started to fade away it started to become smaller everything that everything that that i started to do was just it was it didn't matter friends nothing nothing mattered that's what we that's the place that where we need to get to where nothing else matters we have to do things in our daily life i understand that i i completely do but we have to walk in the sight of god's love we have to step back into and commune with him and i just think about since there's not really too many scriptures that talks about enoch but we have but since we're supposed to be scripturally like enoch i just think of myself like him and i just think about his daily walk that he had with the lord amen friends just he just he just walked with the lord so he you know he just was he he had that love that first corinthians 13 talked about so he just he he just let everything else fade away it says that he was pleasing to god so everything else didn't matter to him so i just try to place myself in the in that place every time i wake up in the morning i just think to myself you know lord you know there's i got to get to work i got to do these things but lord i just i'm dying right now i lay down myself so that something you can do you can do something through me today lord use me use me to to say something for to to be a witness to whatever it is lord use me for the furtherance of your kingdom that should be our thought every moment of every day so that we can be used for the furtherance of his kingdom friends amen he's he stepped into what we've been talking about imagine just walking down the street and singing praises to god just communion communing with him praying fervently and just one day said he had his walk-in shoes on and he just just kept on walking and he didn't come back amen friends that's gonna be us one day we're just gonna walk into the sight of god's love and we won't come back amen people will wonder where we're at but we won't be here we're gonna be in god's eternal love at that point he walked so far into the sight of god's love that one day he went so far that god didn't want him to turn back that's where we need to be friends i want to be so far into god's love that he doesn't want me to turn back he he sees where we're at he sees the struggles that we go through there for our benefit he sees what we need to to to have in our lives he sees each one of us and we have a personal walk with him but he knows and he wants us to get to the place where we're walking in his sight where we're walking in the sight of his love enoch fulfilled second john 1 through 6 where it says and this is love that we walk according to his commandments and this is the commandment just as you heard from the beginning that you should walk in it he fulfilled ephesians 5 1 where it says be therefore followers of god as dear children and walk in love he fulfilled these scriptures before they were even written amen and he walked in the love as christ has also also loved us and hath given himself for an offering and a sacrifice to god for our sweet smelling savior that's ephesians 5 1. he walked in the love of god so steadfastly that one day he just kept on walking my prayer tonight is that we can just find the love of god around us so that we can be pleasing to him in everything that we do to walk with the lord so that when he comes down when he descends and he comes his second coming and takes us home that we're so ready to go that we just are translated amen that's what we're supposed to get to a prayer that prophet prays says i want god just now in his mercy for i'm in love with him and i want to give him such divine love that sovereign grace will send back the baptism of the holy spirit upon me to make me a different person amen i want to be that different person tonight anybody else with me tonight who else wants to be a different person i don't want to just pray that prayer and say words i want to be a changed human being i want to be a changed christian i want to be walking down the street when other people see me and when i have conversations with my co-workers and i want them to see the love of god projected through me because that is the that is the position that he has called us to get into i want to be not just your average different not just just oh you're a christian oh you're different oh you don't do this oh i want to be i want to be jesus different i want to be enoch different amen friends i want to be stephen different i want to be brother brain i'm different friends these these these people that i'm talking about they weren't accepted in in their day they weren't enoch wasn't accepted in his day he was pleasing to the lord which means that everybody else probably didn't think too much of him amen that's usually how it goes down if if if you have a close relationship with god you take anybody in the scriptures you take look at noah he preached for was it 120 years and nobody nobody got on the ark except except for his family amen nobody liked him oh this guy's just preaching rain and preaching well it's not gonna rain and and oh but one day guess what friends it started to rain oh friends we're we're we're talking about a rapture and we're preaching this that is going to take place we're preaching that it's going to that we're going to be translated in in the blink of an eye amen and one day just like it was in noah's day how the how the ark took place how the rain started falling just like enoch started walking one day with the lord and didn't didn't walk back from his heavenly walk that's one day is what we're going to get into friends amen i want to get to a point in my relationship with christ where there's such divine love projected through us that we can break through into what jesus called the most important commandment of loving one another and loving him which we excuse me which we read earlier if we can project the right kind of love through grace and mercy just like jesus did forgive 70 times seven bind together in prayer with that person so so there's there's a there's a step there's a process to do you have to when you're the lord says to forgive you forgive and forgive and forgive and forgive brother jason talked about it a few weeks ago it's you oh again you did the same you you messed up again we just do what the lord tells us to do we we project the love that he projected to us amen we have messed up hundreds and thousands of countless of times i'm just talking about myself i don't know about y'all that's just probably the number on me amen friends i mess up daily but he projects his love and his grace is ever abounding we have to do we have to step into that position as christians as individuals as believers to to project that towards other people amen where we forgive that many more times and once we do that that the next part of that is we bind together in prayer with that person amen and go in and go to the father with a need where anything is possible anything amen friends anything is possible and to take it even a step further to take it even one step further make that need that you're praying for after you forgive after you after you ask for his love after you do these things make that need be the souls of those around you because those are the what is most important friends that is what is most important is the souls of those around you there we can we can have good deeds it says it says that in scriptures but that's not the main thing the god wants he made a way for every man and it's through projection of that love that we can that we can bring people into the family amen and if we can bind together in prayer with those that we have forgiven bind together in prayer with our brothers and our sisters who may have done us wrong or who may have not if we just bind together and we believe enough then we can pray for the baptism of the holy ghost for a refresher filling for ourselves and for those around us for those people for those for those unbelievers for those for those in our family our friends our our loved ones whoever it may be we can bind together and we can stand in the gap and apply the token and and believe that they will be saved amen and they will be because it says that when we come together and pray that my father in heaven moves and it says when two or three together he moves even more quickly amen if we can just keep our sight on the love of the lord so much that we are like enoch when we can just put our walking shoes on be so pleasing to the lord that we just come right on to him amen friends he tells this story and it's just such a simple story and i'm just going to talk about it a little bit tonight but i'm sure that we've all heard it and i just just such a simple such a simple story such a simple story of love where brother branham was at home one day and he was just being with his family and a little possum just starts walking towards him and it was in the daytime which is not usually when possums are out they're nocturnal creatures and he noticed that it was it had gotten ran over and there was it was some infection in the leg and and there was but there was babies he saw the babies was in the pouch and his um his neighbor was a veterinarian and she said oh man that possum we just you know we should probably just put it down it's you know it's it's gonna die and those babies are all going to die their mouths aren't meant to be bottle-fed so they can't be they can't be saved and brother branham had just such a he had such a i can't do that i don't want to i don't want to do that to that poor little creature and it came in and it walked all the way to the threshold of brother branham's house and he sat there and he just the veterinarian and the husband um i think it was mrs wood and mr wood they came and they said oh brother you gotta you gotta billy you gotta get rid of that thing that's gonna and the and it had passed out and um the babies were were still milking from it and he said those babies are gonna die a terrible death and he said i know i just can't i just i don't i don't want to do it or something and i just can't do it and he said that he it laid there all night long and the next morning his little girl got got up and just said daddy you know that that possum is you know that's a real that's a real mother isn't it you know is is it gonna die are you gonna kill it she's just crying and you know he said i just can't maybe i just i can't kill it i don't know what it is i just i can't can't do it and something just starts to talk to brother rayne i mean starts to talk to him you you talked about this in your sermon you talked about this about this about this love why don't you pray for this little creature why don't you why don't you pray and he something changed in him a little countenance change and he said oh but lord i don't know if that's what i don't know if that's what you wanted me i didn't know that's what you wanted me to do oh my goodness okay oh lord i pray that just in in the name of jesus that you would just make this thing whole and that that it would stand up and that each one of the little babies would be well and it would walk away and this possum had been laying there all night and miss wood and the veterinarian came back that next morning and said you know if it was gonna get up it would have gotten up in the middle of the night but it didn't and it was it was pretty well close to dead and he prayed that prayer and that little possum got up and walked away and just as such a simple story of love friends that god the creator of everything saw such a such a little creature such a small creature with those little babies and through the through his prophet he projected a love and it and it showed the prophet it showed that even god loves even the smallest of creatures he loves even the smallest of each one of us amen i'm the smallest of of his of his family i'm the smallest but he loves even us friends and he sees that he sees our hearts he sees that and he wants to project his love to us if we just if we just approach his throne approach it with love and and apply these things to our lives and walk with him like enoch walked if god could think that of a possum how much more can he think of you and i when your love is produced and projected into the heart of the living god by instinct alone the opossum didn't have any soul it's just an animal it was if it could be done that way by instinct the holy spirit could lead the old mother opossum there knowing that he would have to pray for that old possum and her life would be spared how much more are you than that possum how much more are those lives around us than that possum how much more are our brothers and our sisters and our family and our friends and our co-workers and the people that we see every single day how much more are they to god he wants to see them in his family he wants to see us project his love so much so that we can step in line and so that those others can see his love projected through us amen he when they see that love they see something different inside of us and they want that they yearn for that amen and i want to project that love tonight amen because everybody just want to stand to their feet with me just have a word of prayer heavenly father we come before you tonight lord we just have a simple thought lord we pray that the love that we talked about lord the love in your scriptures lord your greatest commandment we pray that each one of these things that we can apply it to our lives father god that we can lord god just apply everything in this scripture to our lives so that we can walk in the love of jesus so that one day when it's time when it's time for you to call us home that we're already walking in the sight of god father we humble ourselves tonight lord god we're privileged to be gathered together lord just a group of believers a group of christians a group of group of friends lord jesus just in your congregation father lord we pray for each one tonight lord we pray for the needs out there we pray that lord your heavenly presence can just be made known tonight and in our hearts and that you would just speak to us father we love you and we just surrender each one of these words and into our hearts lord and ask it all in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen friends don't lose sight of his love for us amen thank you praise the lord you love the lord i've asked brother brad if he will sing that for us again i tell you i felt such an anointing off that song lord prepare me to be a sanctuary i think we are being a saint my let's sing let's sing some of that [Music] pure and holy [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] with thanksgiving [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's beautiful let's raise up our hands and sing it again now oh lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] lord will be your life [Applause] thanks you where [Applause] [Music] amen praise the lord what an encouraging sermon what an encouraging sermon i thought to myself right as brother kayla was getting going i i i was so appreciated his testimony because that that was really a question as you can imagine in the minister's heart and particularly a pastor i suppose you know sometimes you see people make a commitment and they come to the lord give the life of the lord come to an altar at a church at home in a car whatever and sometimes you can see that it's only a half measure and you almost can be like well that's not going to go anywhere but it can it can just carry on amen you know i i was reminded brother branham said however much now i i gotta tell you i wouldn't have never thought this would be true i would have never said it but a prophet said it he said as much as you will move out the world move the world out of you and make room for him he'll come in and take that space i mean we we tend to think it's just all or none but you know god's love just goes beyond our thinking doesn't it i'm so appreciative of that tonight and i i thought to myself that you know i love that statement brother caleb made and i i hope you caught it that god has an entire love story for our lives did you ever know that did you ever stop and think for a moment wow the lord has every part of my life he has a script a program a way to go that's going to project his love the real love amen not the marginalized and you know deluded love i mean the world today that that word has become so cheap it almost means nothing anymore you know and um it's just it's almost become completely marginalized in the modern world but i i'm glad that the lord still has the real thing available to me i appreciate that brother caleb we're going to go to prayer and we had a number of requests that i actually didn't get to um last wednesday and just to give you those uh right quick and we'll go to prayer we had a prayer request to pray for the sigmund family this is my wife's uh her aunt patsy and her second oldest son was tragically killed in a car accident and that whole family has had a lot of tragedy and has suffered quite a bit you can carry on sister ruth and they you know quite a lot of uh sadness there and and over the years we've watched uh you know a lot of a lot of resistance to the truth of god's word almost not just resistance but resentment and i tell you that stuff just catches up to you and we've watched that family unfold with tragedy after tragedy after tragedy sometimes people don't think they don't stop and think what they might be coming against amen and so but nonetheless we love them and i knew the young man quite well saw him raise up from just a small boy and um he was probably of of of the three children he was probably the best one but i i can't say that for sure because i haven't been around him in quite a few years but coming up he always seemed to have such a tender heart so we want to pray for my wife's aunt patsy patsy sigmund the whole sigmund family and ask the lord to be merciful to him sometimes you never know friends god can use those kinds of things and break off years of resistance and and change a heart in a time and a time of grief that's actually imagine this now what brought sister gene to the lord was a broken heart from losing a baby to sids losing a baby hell was timothy mom three months old loses loses him in the middle of the night to sudden infant death syndrome and that broke her heart so bad that the lord was able to deal with her and she gave her heart to the lord and has never looked back so i got a brother waiting on me a man that i get to meet along with another one over there who i'm gonna probably ring his neck when i first meet him but the one i'm gonna i'm gonna you know meet him for the first time amen so we love love the lord for these things we also had this come in from brother jack brother jason please have the church to remember steve harrison he has covered for four weeks now he's been real good to me and i told him we would have special prayer for him thanks and that's from brother jack had a request that come in that somehow i don't i'm not sure how this got missed but um it came in to our web through the email please pray for my mom lorraine's salvation and pray for her healing this is somebody from overseas

who might be listening audio we'll have a video archive for you to catch how many appreciated the word amen tonight coming from brother caleb amen sister grace good to see you tonight now you can see why we love this guy hey man happy to have her here tonight i saw her walk in and uh i asked for the camera said do you know grace is going to be here he said no so praise the lord i appreciated the word coming forth tonight amen why don't you join hands with someone standing near you and let's go to the lord in prayer for these needs master lord we're thankful for your word tonight such a lesson to us lord such a reality i appreciate it so much the the brother caleb's ability to make that real lord that it it wasn't some far-reaching complex thing to try to grasp somehow in our minds it just came across lord so penetrating and so real and it looked doable lord and that is such a such an ability lord of ministry to take the word of god something that's supernatural and really impossible for a human to ever achieve on their own and and presented in such a way to you you have hope to say i believe i can become that lord oh god fill up hearts tonight with that love that real not that not that marginalized deluded love that people don't even know what they what it means anymore but lord that real shekinah presence of god living in our lives it is our as brother caleb said it's our it is upon us lord it's only your bride she's the one saddled with the responsibility just like stephen it's us lord we are saddled with this responsibility to not only having to hold this love but to project it to the world there's no way we'll do that lord if our if our lives are filled up with carnality of the world father help us let us empty out his brothers said lord we die but we die daily every day more and more so that we can project because when we project that kind of love well then grace takes over oh that'll bring the holy ghost into our homes that'll that'll bring eternal life to our family and to our children that'll bind evil spirits and cast out evil spirits lord we need that in this hour that we live in may what we heard tonight become a reality daily in our lives father we've read out these requests to you we're thinking lord of this person who wrote in the email or we're praying lord for those that myriad of requests that they had lord all asking big things i'm thinking about a prophet saying you should ask for big things god wants to be asked he's a heavenly father and desires to do for his family lord may you grant every one of those requests down to the last detail i pray father for this friend of brother jack who's been very good and very kind to your to your servant to your son lord may you now show him that same love may it project back lord brother jack assuring him that we would have special prayer and here we stand lord asking for this man master that you would have mercy upon his life steve harrison father for the sigmund family you know the history of that you know the things we've witnessed over the years be that as it may that all notwithstanding we ask for mercy lord we ask for mercy we still in our heart hold a great love for my wife's aunt patsy lord i know her so well i've known her since uh since i was a teenager lord what a kind woman she's been and her children father have had many many many a heart struggle and i pray master that you'll be merciful and kind and help that family lord above all things open their eyes to to your to your perfect truth and perfect love may you grant it master we're thinking of our own sister and i tonight lord you know what that is i have no idea if doctors could even find it lord sometimes devils are elusive like that but they can't hide from you i pray lord you'll expose him and rebuke him and may our sister be well we're thinking of our sick tonight lord our own sister debbie our own sister rachel lord our own sister josie tonight any brother rodney lord any others that
