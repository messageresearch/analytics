TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all right good morning everybody so I'll Stand and have a word of Prayer oh gracious father Lord we're inviting you into this little Sunday school lore that you would come down and speak to our hearts Lord that these few words that I would have would be anointed by you father that I would say what you would have me say Lord that the people would be able to be edified by it and they'd be able to grow and and maybe hear something that would give him some encouragement and some medification father we ask these things in Jesus name amen you all can um let's let's go ahead and read a scripture while I got you standing um let's turn to um turn to Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 13. uh 13. Hebrews 6 13. um yeah it says for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise you all can be seated um so seems I was I was listening to um a um a news broadcast the other day and there was a guy he was talking about how the the news has changed a lot over the years how you know it used to be back in the day that people wanted to know what what was going on in the world you pick up a newspaper turn on radio or whatever and you get a news broadcast or a news report and that more or less tells you what's happening and you got it you know you had some division in in in the world being you know people having different opinions on what to do with what's going on you know different things happened people have a different opinion on how to approach it um but for the most part everyone more or less agreed that what you got in your newspaper was accurate right right like it was it was more or less the truth it was the same for everybody um and so it's a difference in in you know how we approach those facts but the facts are the same well this guy goes well you know that's differences of opinion are so 20th century here in the 21st century we have differences of facts right nobody can agree on what's even true anymore it nobody agrees that this is what happened you know you you you hear something you know was going on in the news you pick up a newspaper and depending on what newspaper you pick up the story is going to be very very different um depending on what news commentator you're listening to what the actual facts that matter are going to vary pretty wildly and you know this is it's a it's a sign that it creates chaos right I mean everybody nobody knows what's true anymore nobody knows how to approach anything anymore nobody has any sense of of what's concrete and nobody can can move forward and make any decisions because you don't know what's going on that everyone's just kind of blindly kind of shooting in the dark and it it it's it I think it's almost probably a sign of the age really because it extends so much farther Beyond outside of like news or politics um since 2015 the scientific world has been struggling with something they call it the replicability crisis or the replication crisis um so you know in science the way the scientific method was always supposed to function is that people would do an experiment all right you do an experiment get some results you write everything down and publish it and then the idea was that you had to be give very meticulous explanation of what you did and how it worked and what your results were so that some guy from across the world that's never met you has never been to where you are in his own laboratory could look at what you wrote down and repeat everything that you did step by step and get the same outcome right because if two people can do the same thing and get two different outcomes then someone didn't do something right right either what you're looking studying you have no idea what you're looking at or you didn't write something down right somebody lied somewhere right either the guy who did it initially didn't do it you know didn't actually report what he did or or Faked his data or the guy who did it the second time did something wrong regardless something's not right here if you can't repeat it every time if you don't get the same results every time and you know starting in you know when the scientific method and and scientism really kind of started kicking off and you started getting people to transition away from religion and more towards science as a as a their truth Discerning apparatus you really put science on a pedestal because you know you you get the scientific Community going oh well we don't need it we don't need religion right we have science to determine the truth we have this method you know religion is full of charlatans and fakes and con artists who will just tell you any old thing and and there's no way to verify anything and you know here in science we have we have the scientific method and we can we can you know replicate our results and all these sorts of things okay well now we have a crisis because science can't replicate its results in 2015 it kind of kicked off where a bunch of scientists started verifying a bunch of the results they said well wait a minute we've been publishing data publishing papers for like 50 60 years and no one's bothered to actually repeat the studies no one no one did it we just took it on on faith that the first time they did it was right and so they said all right well we're going to replicate they took a hundred of the biggest studies that they could find and and did replication studies on them couldn't replicate any of it and so they're all scratching their heads going okay folks we got a problem because we've been we've been doing Decades of research and Decades of conclusions off of papers that we can't we can't say with any confidence or accurate yeah right and because then because then what happens is these papers get published and then people do additional studies using those as the foundations and then you've got layers of falsehood stacked on top of each other well this so where's your where's your truth in science now nothing was replicatable and then it started it started in Psychology and then it it ended up in medicine even a lot of medical journals they're in big big research papers that they put out 50 60 years ago that have Decades of science stacked on top of it can't be replicated and this is medicine right and so for the replication crisis really kind of under the domains of of the social sciences and medicine I find that very interesting because that's the ones that deal with humans right it's the mankind trying to understand how his body and mind works and he can't determine anything true about either one of those things um you know and so we have this so now we we have the world in crisis because they're trying to figure out what's true and they can't because they can't they can't make any of the results stick and so you know that that's that's the world but in this time in this day the promise for the bride of Christ is that it would be a restoration right in this time when no one can determine what's true and the mechanisms that the world has used to determine truth can't be replicated nothing can be done over again yet the promise to the bride is that it would be done over again right that the whole idea of Malachi 4 was to restore the faith back to the original right that it would be it would be God proving that he was true by repeating his results to prove that he has something that they don't have right that there's truth there you know and so um I look at uh it's so it's so you know people people want to act like that there's there's no um you know these these things are for the for the past church right I mean I know here in the message we it's we've been hearing it for so many years it's almost become a cliche but truly the world does not believe in Supernatural things anymore you get some of it in the religious world but it's all very it's nothing like what we believe in it's really not you know you talk about how the Lord did something for you and people kind of raise their eyebrows at you you know like you know well I was I was healed of disease well brother you know that's um you know it's are you sure well I don't know it seemed pretty miraculous to me yeah you know um you know it's it's but what is it it's because we have a people who are taking God at his word and and it's showing that because ultimately you know I I that scripture that I read of where God swear by himself because there was nothing he couldn't lie right I kind of hit on this um last weekend but you know I've always kind of read that scripture and in my mind thought well God can't lie because he can't knowingly say something that's untrue right that's just not he's not able to do that um you know if if you know we had a red cup here he couldn't say that's a blue cup because it's false right that's always the way I kind of thought about it but I was reading that the other day and it kind of clicked in my head a little bit well obviously that is true I mean God can't lie in that sense but I think it's more than that because it's also the fact that God speaks with creative power God speaks and then worlds come into existence if God says if it's a blue cup and God says it's red maybe it just turns red right maybe maybe reality just conforms to what he said not and so when you know God can't lie because nothing he says can be made untrue right nothing he says can ever fall to the ground void it has to turn into something right you know we I I read that quote last week words brother Bram talking about how you know everything that we are the whole world the whole universe is ultimately the manifestation of God's spoken word it's his words made into concrete right the ground you're standing on is ultimately the word of God manifesting into into what it would be right and through this you know and so this is kind of the whole idea behind you know I know the men's prayer meeting has been going through spoken words The Original Seed and you know if you early on in that sermon brother Branham talks about how he you know he's like you know this is going to be this is going to be an explanation of why I believe all the things that I've preached right it's like I've preached a lot of things over the years that a lot of people don't understand but this sermon is going to be the explanation of all of that everything that brother Branham taught could be wrapped up in that sermon right or it's the it's the foundation for everything and the whole Foundation of all of it is that when God speaks it it's a seed there's something there's there's life and and and creative power in that word of God and when he speaks in the unadulterated word comes in contact with you it's going to manifest into something right it will produce something his words have to be made manifest that's why you have to have a a perfect word that's why you can't have a manipulated word um and here here's a a quote from the spoken words The Original Seed I was listening to it again this morning I've listened to it many times and it's fan it gets better almost every time um but he he he says this he says his words are the seeds of life and creation all of everything we are and see is the progress of God speaking he spoke and the universe became even though it took um a thousand years to come to pass oh sorry that was just what I was writing in my notes that's not what brother Brandon said I I've missed my delineation um this is this is where it starts this is that's the reason you can hybrid a donkey and a horse but it won't last it's death but the original has got life it comes back again I hope you can see it now the original has the life so that's the reason um I think that Cults and denominations and organizations die history proves um they're everyone dead they never did rise no more they never will they can't breed themselves back got nothing to breed with they're sterile that's why Eve's children dies so here's ultimately you know when God's spoken word that Original Seed right the original seed that that's that went and blossomed into the universe right that seed has to be perfect and the only the the unadulterated unhybrided word of God will come about with new life right use the illustration of the of the mule and the or the mule right you can breed a donkey and a horse together and you get a mule it's got some life in it right you can mule work hard as any animal you want to think of but it'll never reproduce whatever life it has is hybrid it can't make another mule right you know you can we um there's another crisis they had in the in I believe it was the 90s this happened after generations of genetically modifying corn and hydrating corn they eventually went to plant their corn and the corn didn't grow it came up with deformed mangled on it's nothing they just didn't it didn't produce anything that was corn it was just this pathetic deformity of a plant well why because after generations of hybriding eventually they got to something that wouldn't produce life anymore right at some point Humanity has taken the original Church we've the the the the Through the Ages people have taken the original doctrine of the church the original life that was in the church and manipulated it and conformed it to be something more palatable to what humans wanted right like with the corn original corn when the when the Europeans got to the North America you know the natives had maize which was you know let's corn kind of but if you ever try to eat an ear of maize it ain't nothing like what you think of as corn right it's hard it's unpleasant to eat it doesn't taste great but you know it takes a lot of work to get it to something that is really edible well it's a far cry from an ear of sweet corn that you can get at the grocery store today why it's because they've manipulated it they've grown it because man looked at something that was you know more or less the the creation of of God right this plant and said well this is not to our sensibilities right we want it to be sweeter and softer and nicer and produce more and it's going to be bigger and better and all these things that we want out of it and so after generations of manipulation they got sweet corn eventually they got sweet corn That Couldn't reproduce itself well likewise people have taken the word of God and yeah it's it's got a lot of nutrients and it and it's good for you but it doesn't taste too great sometimes right it's not it's not palatable to our sensibilities it doesn't feel nice to have the hide ripped off you when when you're looking at the mirror of God's word and recognizing that you're that you're wrong really wrong it's not pleasant But ultimately it's the only way you're going to reproduce the life because if you go down this other path and take some something that isn't really there because it fits your sensibilities and it fits what you like well that'll be fine for a while but eventually it won't reproduce you won't have there won't be life right you know the original word [Music] will keep reproducing life eternally you can just keep putting it in the ground and it'll keep coming up and you keep replanting and it'll keep coming up and it'll go over and over and over and over as many years as God allows to be on the earth that seed will keep reproducing but what you know this man-made stuff it won't do that and so your you know on that day on the Resurrection Day if you don't have a genuine Real Deal seed from the original you won't come up in the resurrection right it just won't it won't produce life because it can't because ultimately that's what that's going back to where we started right this is the this is the promise that God gave to the bride at the end was that it would be a restoration of the original right it's the promise that what we have now is the original and so it can it can come up in the resurrection it has life in it and it's God proving that the life that's in it is the truth it's the proving that it's that it is there's something true and genuine there because otherwise it wouldn't come up it wouldn't reproduce it couldn't reproduce in this day that's why you know that all of these other systems that are out there everything else that that's out there ultimately fails and falls apart and ends up wildly deviated from where it started because there wasn't there was something ungenuine about it in the first place right that's why you see when when people you know we've talked about this before you know people who've been in the messenger Christians for 50 60 you know maybe not 50 years but the point is a long time 20 30 40 years maybe and then boom one day they're just not anymore and have a meltdown well why is because there was something not genuine to begin with there was something wrong from the start and they might have been able to replicate they might have been able to replant their seed for 50 years but eventually it came up deformed their life didn't keep going right whatever whatever seed they had was was not the Original Seed um and so that's that's kind of where I feel like you know we are today in at this in this day and hour here we are as the bride of Christ we're having to recognize that where we are is is the original is is the life that was in Christ right where he could walk out on and do about go about his father's business and have the faith and the understanding that no matter what stood in front of him he could step out on on where he knew on who he knew that he was and can move forward and no nothing was going to come between him and what he was sent to Earth to do right nothing you know he could he could you know there's throughout the the scripture you know there's a lot of instances where it seemed like the Life of Christ was going to be cut very short right it they didn't just try to crucify him well I'll make an example here you know with Judas brother Brown talks about how Judas thought that he could get the money for in and betray Jesus but because Jesus had gotten out of it so many times before there had been many times when the Pharisees tried to Corner him and kill him right it's one they weren't just the first time it wasn't like one day they decided to do it no they've been doing this for years well you know every time they've done it before it just wasn't the right time so Jesus could go and and do things and know that nothing would happen because he had a promise that there was a certain way it was going to go right and it might no matter how how uh difficult things might be no matter how um dark things might be for us no matter how unclear things are um I you know I have a I wish I had it now I'd always always have things that happen to me could never never have the quote that I wanted when I when I'm up here um when it comes to me but you know there's a quote where brother Brands talking about how you know people it was talking about um responsibility how he has a responsibility to handle his gifts and things like that and he says you know people think of me he says you know you'll say to me well brother Brandon it must be so easy to be you because you know God just shows you everything in a vision and you just go about you know what you see in the vision he's like no I have to pray and struggle and and and and and and and scrape about for the will of God probably harder than you do it's like it's not like God just showed up and and showed him everything in a vision and then you know every single day his whole day's planned out because God laid his schedule out for him you know no it's not how it was at all brother Branham was was struggling and he's like and not only that he's like I have to struggle for for guidance probably stronger than you do and the weight of the the responsibility the the ramifications of me getting wrong is way worse than you guys right so ultimately you know and and so there's going to be times where it's not going to seem clear right you can you can absolutely be in the will of the Lord and have no idea right it's not it's not super clear it's gonna be super dark it's gonna be discouraging and fearful but that's what we take hold of the promise and say well yeah but the word says that it's gonna be like it was then the word even though maybe in and of myself I don't feel like I am you know the the literal Life of Christ manifested again well the word says that you are and so even if it doesn't look that way necessarily to your eyes you have to keep moving forward you can never let go of that it's it's always going to be um a distraction and it's you always have to have confidence that Eve because God spoke it right God spoke it and even if it doesn't look like it now even if you can't necessarily see it with your eyes we recognize that because God spoke it and no matter how dark we get right if the cup is blue when God speaks it turns red well if God says you're perfect and you can look at yourself and say well I'm unperfect well okay give it a minute right you know God spoke you know God spoke and said let there be light and it took a thousand years for that to manifest right we'll take a promise into our life and if it's not done in 35 seconds all right well that must not have been for me wow come on right it's a seed seeds take time to grow right you got to put it you got to sink it the promise into your heart you got to take that that word that he spoke you know of healing of salvation of of being a new creation of having your desires changed having these things take that promise and sink it into your heart and when tomorrow morning it's not sprouted you don't go ah man let me dig it up and make sure it's okay right no you'll never get anything that way you just leave it there and if you don't see it for a while okay keep pouring the water of the word on it keep feeding on the word keep reading and praying eventually it's going to come up right eventually eventually the life that's in it is gonna is gonna become prove itself true yeah so I guess that's we're out of time so we'll stand and have a word of Prayer father Lord thank you for this opportunity to maybe give some encouragement to your people Lord I trust that my words would have been something that the people will be able to take hold of and give them a a boost father to keep fighting and keep swinging their sort of Faith driving back the powers of the enemy Lord father as you would come with be with us Lord in this coming service we've be with us that we could praise your holy name and that you would hear our our praises and our worship Lord and that you would speak to us and commune with us in the coming service father we ask these things in your holy and precious name with the Lord Jesus Christ amen foreign
