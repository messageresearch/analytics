house of God tonight we're going to go into his word first you know I want to turn to Ephesians first let's go to Ephesians chapter 6. then we will double go on forward to First Peter 5. amen happy to be here and sure enjoying that worship and singing I just I missed Sunday and I jumped on the archive and my goodness all the worship and the singing and it was just wonderful I I was this afternoon almost feeling you know I don't know where it was coming from probably because the devil was battling me and the very thing I'm going to preach on tonight so there you go amen so um I I kind of caught that and I just said I got a remedy for that I'm gonna go to church and listen to people singing and I tell you it works like magic amen I just feel so eager to move into this lesson tonight I actually uh get to continue on in my family Series tonight I my plan was always as I announced to take the first Wednesday of the month but scheduled it and allow for that this month so I'm just now getting to it amen praise the Lord I want to take the thought coming back I want you to catch I'm saying this because I'm going to tell you what I titled it what I decided to title it 51-49 then I'm going to give you the 49 that lost out but I decided to title it coming back to the mind of the word and I almost titled it don't change the default settings of the word [Laughter] I did too it was a little bit nerdy and that's kind of me but uh or geeky I guess I'm more geeky than I'm nerdy amen right right sweetheart amen but um the one coming back to the mind of the word that's how it struck me when the Lord reigned it out of the heavens on me a couple of days ago like to just report that we had a wonderful time at the meetings in Swansea and the Lord moved very mightily it was wonderful to see some familiar faces up there and uh but I also know you had a wonderful time here sister Debbie told me when I got home I said my I was feeling sorry for for the Mac because I I knew there was going to be a lot of people out of town I had a group of them up there with me brother JD and Sister Amy were still away Brother Brad and Sister Sarah hadn't got back yet and my wife said it you couldn't tell she said if it was thin said it felt like a camp meeting and I said wow let me jump online and hear that and so I did and um man right I've got right into the middle of it or not in the middle I was about a third of the way through and brother Matt called me and I said hey I can't talk I'm listening to a preacher and so then I got back to it again later on and he called me again and I said this is the second time you have interrupted me from hearing a really good sermon hey man so I really enjoyed it and I could hear you all rejoicing you can always hear Brother Luther but I could hear everybody rejoicing that was really amazing I know you had a good time and I can tell you we had a wonderful time up in the Columbia area with brother Benny Perry it's been years since I've kind of renewed an old acquaintance with brother Benny it really did my heart good number of preachers there representing the Columbia churches so we just had a grand grand time word amen uh Ephesians chapter 6 welcome home to Brother Brad and Sister Sarah amen I thank brother Jason and Sister Amy came in and then they got drugged back to the camp brother Matt and sister Rachel led a team of our of our team members and workers to go take a fresh tour to kind of get the logistics and everything with our Our Youth Camp is coming up rapidly amen and so they went uh to get a good jump on that and make sure we've got everything in preparation so perhaps I would imagine they're not going into the camp till dawn's early light so they're probably streaming tonight say God bless to all of them amen second I'm sorry I keep determined to go to Peter Ephesians chapter 6 verse 10. and here I am but I'm determined greed Ephesians first oh yeah here we go that's actually a plagiarism of Dale Smith I already say that one time it's funny hey Manny Ephesians 6 10 verse 10. amen finally my brethren be strong in the Lord oh here we go this is why I wanted to read this one first finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might don't forget we're working on our family Series tonight finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might so that's simply telling you that don't just have strength but use it don't don't be passively strong be actively strong here here's why see here's what you need to do put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world boy there is a lot of powers of darkness in this world Amen against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand and therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace this is a lot I mean this is a lot Paul is serious about this above all as if he hasn't already piled a bunch on you above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked don't think he ain't going to shoot a mansion my goodness this is this is how you survive that all right and and this is how you get victory and take the helmet of salvation and the sword I love this one and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God and he goes on there with praying always with prayer and supplication uh First Peter chapter 5. laughs First Peter chapter 5 and I just want one quick verse here verse 8. first Peter 5 and verse 8. be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he made devour I don't read anything and hear where he takes a vacation I don't read anything nothing I've read in Paul's warning advice and admonition and Peter's warning and advice and admonition suggests even remotely to me that you might get a break from this this is a constant Warfare amen let's pray father we thank you for your word tonight and I'm grateful to you for this opportunity to cover this lesson tonight Lord It's meant a lot to me and in a personal way just I Lord we just I hate the devil I just be honest I hate him and I'm gonna really enjoy standing Lord and watching him kicked off into the Lake of Fire good riddance and goodbye forever and Lord I make no bones about that I want to see him destroyed I want to see the kingdom of God underway Lord oh my that's what we live for father now while we're here we need to be battle ready Lord because we are certainly going to be battle challenged father I we you've given us a word that is Battle tested and is proven Lord that it can bring victory that it can meet the challenge of the devil Anytime Anyplace under any condition or circumstance so I'm asking for your help tonight Lord that we might be instructed from your word in Jesus name amen God bless you as you're seated foreign the greatest battle ever fought brother Branham takes a theme of spiritual warfare between God's power and Satan's power and it's you know it's something that uh thank you brother Matthew it's something that the spirit of God felt very passionate about and brother Branham took quite a lengthy sermon you know to really come into this with both feet and he's he you know we've been working on the series uh in our men's uh prayer meeting I think we just recently finished it nearly six hours of teaching on the spoken word is the Original Seed and this is all similar in theme and brother Branham is working on how that we are to go about Warfare there is I want to First say this that this is a battle as brother Branham points out that there are only two Powers um and two kingdoms in this universe you have God's power of life and you have God's power of death now I'm going to give it the old Notre Dame try tonight to stay in a teaching mode um and we'll see how it goes my voice is a little bit raw and I'm trying to let it rest up first so I'll be back good for this weekend so it just works out perfect actually brother Branham I heard him saying the same thing in greatest battle he said I've just come in for meetings my voice is really you know hurting and he said so I just want to teach tonight but he didn't he didn't stay teaching and so I don't know how this would go but anyway we're gonna try I really want to and I want to watch my time very studiously so so I'm going to have to go very very quickly through these points to get to the real burden of my heart but these two Powers we find that this battle that we are facing is started in heaven brother Brandon that's one of the very first things behind the fact that there are two Powers uh God and the devil and one is life and one is death and they're both battling for control of God's kingdom Satan wants it uh and God's determined he ain't going to get it and so you know the battle starts in heaven of all places brother Branham emphasizes that it didn't start in the earth it started in heaven now I can't by any means I would love to take this over into Revelation 12 because that's really you know the the it's going to speak about the battle that started before uh Adam and Eve were even ever in the Earth or before there was an earth it spilled over into the Earth and brother Branham talks about makes a number of statements that you know in one place he says God and Satan decided uh to mutually agree upon a battlefield where are we going to fight and since the the the battle since the war was for the control of the kingdom and since the kingdom is God's family hello Kingdom see the Bible says that he hath made he hath made Revelation 1 6. he hath made us Kings and Priests see and so the oldest manuscripts say that he hath made us a kingdom see so we're a kingdom of Kings and Priests and might say a little bit more on at least on the priest aspect of it here in a moment but we find that brother Branham said the agreement was made that the Battleground for control of the Kingdom would be waged in the mind of mankind the mind of humanity so this is exactly why Satan can come and try to put a evil thought in your mind and make you feel like a hypocrite for thinking it but you know it you can't keep a bird from flying over your head but you can sure prevent him from building a nest on your head and so this is why we have to actively constantly cast down vain imaginations these are things that infect the spirit man that's where the mind is and we're not talking about your gray matter we're talking about the Mind as a man thinketh in his heart so is he say well I thought that's the soul remember friends the soul is the nature of the spirit all right it's a part of you you're born with a fallen nature thank God there's a gene of God that comes to life in the old Nature's annihilated and now your mind has a new nature to think about God and but we realize that it's uh it's it's in a no man's land where you it's it's a phenomenon really where you've literally got two different kind of people walking around in one body that's uh that's a paradox how that how is that even possible and we had to have a Prophet come and explain how Paul is breaking that down that you you know yours your spirit where your memory your reason your conscience your affection your imaginations are those along with your sight your senses all of that is all still in a fallen condition your imagination your conscience your memory your affection your reasoning but now you've got another inner voice you've got a new nature which is Zoe the life of God and now there's a battle before you're born again your battle is only with legalism you're you're living a legalistic life because you don't want to go to hell you don't want to miss the Rapture you know to do right you know it's God's word therefore you have a desire and you fight to do the right thing uh but but that is so exhausting and you know it's so much easier if you just go ahead and are willing to die and be born again and then you've got the inner the help of the Inner Man see you put him in the control tower but now that does bring really a greater battle in fact is it brings the greatest battle ever fought but it's a sum positive the summation is a is a net gain because you're because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world so you're better off fighting the greatest battle with the new birth then a lesser battle without it makes sense so be you born again see and then even when we're born again then we have all of these admonitions to cast down vain imaginations let the mind which was in Christ let his thinking work through you think his thoughts agree to it uh not only agree that it's true but agree to act on it see so this is all what that whole sermon was about how that it started in heaven with Michael and his angels fighting against Lucifer and his angels and he's cast into the Earth and it fell on human beings and the Battleground now for this war is the human mind where decisions are made and so there's where you know you have to start out that's where a new birth starts you first in your mind you have to accept the word of God and and that's why brother Brandon would say see if he can just get that mind to agree with him then then it annihilates that old sinful nature because you're you're not you don't you want you refuse to reason the word you hear it and the Holy Spirit anoints you he helps you he comes upon you opens your under the eyes of your understanding and then you're like the men on the road to Emmaus you're begging him to stay amen you don't want to be without him anymore see and so that's that's how the pattern works and then God begins to grow in your life and so you know that that mind that accepts the word of God by faith but because you're a free moral agent and you have free moral agency you can refuse the word of God you can just say it ain't for me or you can say well that's a really nice idea and it would be a good lifestyle I think I'll go ahead and adopt some of the principles of the brother random called them the fine qualities of Jesus and now to our shock and dismay to those of us who are born again the overwhelming majority of the world choose the other thing we scratch our heads how can you do that if you only understood what a glorious thing it is to have God living in you if I could if I could just open my heart and my mind and put it in you and you could see for just a moment it's just like if you could go to heaven brother Brandon went there and he said I come back he said I could never be the same for if you're not born again tonight oh if I could just get you to taste it for a minute you'd never want to go back to fighting the Battle of legalism again as we said the the fine qualities of Jesus are just that they're very fine they are very good for life if there was no Heaven I've made this statement unequivocally if there was no heaven and no eternal life I would still live the life of a practicing Christian because it's safer it's healthier it's more blessed it's a better life uh and and I avoid all of the pitfalls that try to kill me and make me ill and disease me and Destroy and take my money and take my marriage and take my children I'd much rather I'd much rather live the life of a Christian and so so we find out that you know this is a tremendous war and so the enemy then so so we find that given if I'd say it like this given that the Holy Spirit directs you know his Prophet to identify the mind uh as the battlefield where spiritual warfare takes place and and we can see that God God's word I mean it's all through the scripture and then in this day God anoints the prophet to go back and pull it out to you again and call it the greatest the greatest battle so God's word obviously places a tremendous a tremendous importance and you can read it we're not going to go through all of the places we can read we might refer to them and we already referred to a number of them such as letting the mind was in Christ be and you let the word of God dwell in you richly cast down vain imaginations bring anything that's contrary to God's word subject to the word amen remember all of that add to your faith virtue add to your virtue knowledge add add add for these things being you and abound they make you that you shouldn't either be Barren nor unfruitful right they actually can get you to the point where you never fall I'll take that wow that's a deal but you got to fight and you got to put you got a strap on the armor and you got to use it you got to equip yourself and you're never you're so so you can imagine that the enemies strategy then since he can't confront you directly on the word because he knows you believe it he can't he just can't come at you and try to get you to doubt this because you're my whole confidence is in it so he knows that he's real crafty and he's real smart so his strategy is I re is to relentlessly attack your mind since he knows that's where the battle is and since he also knows you actually can't pray him out of there because it's his god-given right God this God agreed the Battleground would be the mind so you can't say Lord please make him stop putting bad thoughts in my mind I'm sorry you say the Lord will say I can't do that I've already made a deal with him that that's the Battleground well Lord what can I do about it put on Armor it's not rocket science strap up come on Amen and so you're going to fight so he he can't take the word directly he knows you believe it too strongly so he wages a constant Battle of of misdirection distraction and what I'm just going to call busyness see anything that he can do to keep you from putting on the whole armor or casting down or praying without ceasing or coming to the house of God or reading your Bible and praying anything he can do to get you to get in a world to where you're making bad decisions which only exacerbate a problem and give him a better opportunity like a vicious cycle and he gets you on a Merry-Go-Round of failure after failure after failure next thing you know you're laying face down in the ground and and and and and we we roll you over and we pick you up and say what happened and you know you don't even know I felt so spiritual Sunday wow how what happened to me thank God I got a Wednesday night I can kind of get in here and get cleaned often you know come on oh yeah I'm a Christian that's right you are so it's all about coming back to the mind of the word in everything that's a that's such an important Point how that Satan is just going to attack you that way so relentlessly again and again and again you know I I I I read an article and I just want to mention a couple of little things tonight I don't have time I'm not a news man I'm not here to give you a science lesson or a psychology lesson but I read on a couple of Articles recently I just want to make a one or two comments from them and I I read one article very recently about you know they they they had a group of people I forget the I don't know if it was Gen X or gen Z I don't remember which but I think it was gen Z and they were saying you know can you give us a list uh it's very recent you might have seen it yourself they wanted a list of what was normal 20 to 30 years ago but is not now what was normal 20 to 30 years ago but is no longer normal and there was a whole list of them I only picked out three that that were remarkable to me I had such an affinity with and one person says I remember as a kid 20 to 30 years ago it was normal as a kid staying outside literally all day foreign yourself so we were we were pretty much free to do as we wished yeah we didn't have cell phones and we're just expected to check in at least once I remember that and I remember not checking in and getting the what for from Sister Gene and so but but you know we we're expected to check in and it's amazing that parents could even allow that you know I wandered all over my neighborhood and other neighborhoods and got on my 10 speed with my friends and would ride for miles but parents didn't have the same dangers to worry about and and and kids knew how to really play without all the technology and that that that is so abnormal today to play without Tech but they actually knew how to play without technology and and they knew how to socially interact without social media only a couple of few decades ago here was another one uh and I and I'm taking don't anybody say Amen you you'll embarrass yourself watching television for an ouch watching television for an hour and not seeing 24 minutes worth of medicine commercials I went wow I remember hearing a preach one time saying that those medicine commercials if you keep watching they'll almost get you to believe and you can't live without that stuff the third one I picked up and he says and this one really touched my heart he said back when Sundays were actually observed a few decades ago back when Sundays were actually observed well I remember this I remember as a child that stores were closed and commerce just didn't happen for many of us it was and Still Remains a day that reminds us of our faith for others it was a day to commune with family over a meal of pasta and meatballs and and and and and and sauce or gravy depending on your version of Italy it was it was lovely and we still honor this time-honored tradition I just thought wow that was that that should have never been lost I'm going to tell you something as a as a as a global population not just America but finally America Two we lost something America and the world lost something when they stopped taking one day to honor God and come together and stay with family and have spiritual food and natural food and I tell you something friends if you've lost that get it back take it back do whatever you got to do get it back that is a Monumental thing this is what I mean you know the fact that we don't have these things normally anymore is evidence that Satan fights us with busyness distractions you know because a memory can attack you directly so he uses all of these things I read a Surgeon General warning that it is recent and um it was a very interesting article if I can get to it here yeah and it was just several months ago and the U.S Surgeon General uh warned in a new advisory that that this is the Surgeon General now this isn't a message preacher okay this is the Surgeon General himself he's warning that widespread social media use among kids and teens poses a significant I want to underscore that word it's it poses a significant mental health risk that needs to be addressed immediately and it's it's on fire I mean technology now has already went to the next level AI has blowed the world up and changed everything see social media is used almost universally now this is a global number with up to 95 percent globally 95 percent of Youth between ages 13 and 17 report using it the Surgeon General warned in his new advisory um that let's see such advisories are and here's the reporter this is this is the reporter making this comment and he's saying these kinds of advisories from the Surgeon General when when the man himself comes forward and makes a public statement that he's the reporter is saying you need to understand that these kinds of things are as a matter of course reserved for significant public health challenges and they only do it when he's got something so urgent that it requires the nation's immediate awareness and action these are people at the head of IT are afraid where this is is headed and that it's already already deeply and so he's he goes on to say according to his the this report it says substantial review of the available evidence on the impact of social media this is a substantial review the report says that social media use in kids and teens can result in both a heightened emotional sensitivity which that can lead to lower life satisfaction and we've seen that everybody is in the instant gratification mode and you can't you can't hardly and and it's not just kids it's on adults you can't even hardly take a breath see and so where I'm saying to you tonight this is the devil's tactic and sometimes you have to just shake yourself and stay I need to get back to the mind of the word rather than the mind of this Tech or that Tech or this social strata or this political Hot Topic or this well you know I I you need the mind of the word and a majority of adolescents report now here's something that he also acknowledges a majority he's he's acknowledging to say that there can be a good side to it now I thought that's curious because how does anything from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil I guess you know to find out that it's good I get like this this is and I'm got a good use for it you know this is and I've got a good use for it but nonetheless it's it's still got death Associated this has no death associated in it so am I crazy for saying we need more of this and less of this am I crazy see and so he says the majority of adolescents report that social media helps them feel now then I understood you crafty devil now listen close I know your spiritual Minds will catch this a majority of adolescents report that social media helps them feel more accepted like they have people who can support them through tough times like they have a place to show their creative side this is 58 67 71 say this and more connected to what's going on in their friend's life that's 80 percent according to the report and I just thought to myself how is it that this that this is is is not these things that they list here what were they feeling more accepted support in tough times showing a creative side expressing themselves in creative ways connected you know to friends and family and I thought to myself how is it that this is not coming through the dynamic of a nuclear family it's coming through social media and somehow that's a good thing am I nuts and and he's saying well it is a good thing that they have all of these I'm going you got to be kidding do you think that's a good thing you're saying that they have to have that because they don't have this they don't have nuclear family they don't have token applied homes wake up America wake up word wake up search in general well you needed to come out with there is a report that there's not enough Bible reading in homes there's not enough family sitting across the table praying and breaking bread together see so I mean my goodness I mean this should be this should be part of the alarm that this back door way is what I call it you know for them to get the positive reinforcement that they need uh as they grow is not coming through wholesome family life but is coming through some substitutionary way from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil why are good grief you don't even know who's on the other end of that chat line just because they show you a picture well they already know that don't mean nothing it might not even be the gender of the person they show you you don't know nothing about that person and that's where you're getting your help through tough times really uh that's that that that's where you're you're feeling more accepted I mean that should have been red lights he should have had that above the other thing yeah I'm not I'm not dissing on the Surgeon General I appreciate his concern so still social media can he he says so still even with those advantages which I already don't think are advantages uh tell the president I can't take the car in it still social media use can be potentially harmful I'm thought you think leading to or exacerbating Eating Disorders low self-esteem depression and these are all according to rigorous studies from the surgeon general's office and he cites them all I'm not going to give you the citations so he says at this time now here's another thing that took my breath away he says at this time we do not yet have enough evidence to determine if social media is sufficiently safe for children and adolescents and we must acknowledge the growing body of research about potential harms increase our Collective understanding of the risk with social media use and urgently take action to create safe and healthy digital environments that minimize harm and Safeguard children's adolescents mental health as well as being critical stages of development and I you know it's I'm thinking to myself I'm glad that they're noticing they need to do something about it but you know he's just saying since we're now he goes on to say and I applaud him for it since we don't have all the evidence in which I that grinds on me because I'm thinking are you kidding look at the young person from the 50s to now look at the look at the nuclear family what it was before 1956 and the nation turned its back on God for the last time I I've shown graphs here on the screen where you you had crime and families and and low divorce rates and and and you know stay-at-home moms and all these and all of a sudden right after 1956 it doesn't just start going like that I showed a graph where it went like this yeah and it just took off like a rocket yeah and you have teenagers with such social anxieties and prescription medications are flying and brother Brandon said in a in a time where we have such plenty and you'd think that it would be almost Utopia but it's the exact opposite of that how much more evidence they need are they going to wait another 50 years and say wow it's probably a bad idea and he's saying you know it's since we don't know we should take action I applaud him for that but but he doesn't tell that here's the action to take it's just we need more time to have studies and you should probably limit the interactivity I'm here to tell you something friends it's not about limiting it's about creating a love affair for this over that and you don't have to take it or remove it or set up legalism you'll have young people who say I want to go to church I want to read my Bible I want to pray I want to have family all it takes is the Holy Ghost come back to the mind of the word tonight see so we need to return what does it mean brother Jason to returning returning my thoughts to the mind of the word I thought about that as a statement because that's how it came to me when it when the sermon began to develop in my mind and I just wrote a few I things down that it meant to me and I'm trusting it'll help you to have clarity you know to return my mind to the thoughts of the word means to turn my thoughts away from say oh he's going to name something he's going to go down a bullet list and clothesline us to death I'm actually not going to do that I'm going to give you such an all-inclusive statement you can make your own list how you like that this is the Kinder gentler version of me tonight not the maniac you had in the Pulpit here last Wednesday to return my mind to the thoughts of the word means to me to turn away from things that are not the word say what is that well whatever it is right that are not the word you need some more of that you need some more turning away proactively not just thinking of a beautiful thought I should do that or even just sitting here tonight saying amen you need to make some you need to put on some armor you need to take the sword which is the word see so that means that in the in the day-to-day things to think about and we have a lot of day-to-day things to think about life is busy and that's the devil's he plays in that see with distractions and busyness so I apply it to think and decide when I when I'm gonna take my day-to-day things that I have to think about I'm going to apply the word that is to say I apply it to think and decide correctly for every decision I make and every action I take I proactively work it out what is the way of the word in this decision or this action and and that's not a light thing and you you have to have to do that I'm here to tell you the Holy Ghost tells you to do it he won't do it for you this is something you have to decide to do and you know after 60 years of being a wrecking ball and limiting the blessing of God on my own life I've decided to just retire and give him full control so what have you learned after 60 years that right there that's what I've learned I've just decided that whenever I'm making decisions that I'm not Consulting his word and whenever I'm going in my own way and I forget I'm a good guy I love the Lord I'm a real Christian but sometimes I just get busy and forget you know like David wanted to bring the ark back great thing but he never consulted the prophet Nathan he consulted captains and guards and and and rulers and Nathan the prophet was right there see and so I I just decided that I'm gonna I'm gonna spend more of my brain power to try to figure out how do I how do I eliminate the world's thinking and I'm talking about sinful thinking I'm just talking about whatever's not the word you get me how many's with me why don't you retire now don't wait till you're 60. just retire now and say okay I'm gonna take your advice Pastor I'm just gonna from this day forward I'm going to consider the word and everything I think and everything I decide to do this is the prayer that I pray you know coming back to the mind of the word I don't know about you but that's the prayer I pray whenever I have found myself recovering from some spiritual stumbling or or maybe just when I'm trying to renew myself from stagnation or carnality I say to myself come back to the mind of the word oh you you can't believe how rapidly you can undo weeks and weeks of the devil's planning and maneuvering and get you into the certain place and spring the Trap and and five seconds of caught turning back to the word and undo all of his plans oh you have the power to to put on the helmet of salvation and the shield of Faith Hallelujah you have that ability friends use it sometimes you know it's something as simple as trying to plot my own course or make a life decision but without seeking his perfect will first ah no ma'am I'm okay I'm sorry I'm sorry I knew better than to wear this thing uh call okay sorry I forgot I forgot I knew there was a reason I should wear my Apple watch and I'm preaching and it doesn't have a Pentecostal blocker button and so a lot of times we're making these decisions without seeking his will first and come on you know as well as me more often than not we just make a a mess out of things and it'll just keep being a mess I can hear I'm here to tell you tonight by experience you can take my word for it it'll just keep getting Messier until you finally go down to your knees and raise up your hands and surrender and say Lord please just take over enough of me already my goodness Hallelujah you know bring me back bring me back lord to the perfect mind of Christ bring me back to your word and all things can that be a desire of your heart tonight friends can you really look at the larger picture and say Lord God bring bring me back to your word in all things in all things with the insanity of the world and goodness friends everything steals our minds away from the word of God doesn't it doesn't it it robs you every day it just sucks the spirituality but I'm here to tell you that what I'm preaching on tonight what I read to you from Saint Paul and if you go to listen to brother Brandon's practical brother Branham has a whole practical thing a list of things you can do that he relates back to scriptures I'm here to tell you it's the cure for what ails you I want you to know that tonight it's the absolute cure for what ails you you are you you know I I want to make this point I've had this point in my in my mind for a number of weeks and I I said it uh to myself and I've already said it to several people that I felt that it could help them you know you you are never you're never going to be able to grasp and take a hold of and and really get the benefits of following the message of the hour without a new birth you're missing out on on the bigger benefits see ing I mean you you can get good direction for Your Life by the message of the hour because it's all scriptural based you can get good life principles from the message of the hour because all it is the restoration of the word with all the debris of man-made theology moved aside that's what the message is two thousand years of church annity piled this under so much debris and the message just digs it out and gets back down to virgin virgin print that's what it is it's not a new gospel it's just the restoration of this see and and you can you can you can absolutely uh get some direction for your life and even without a new birth and some good principles for life even without a new birth but to reap the large benefits of having the mind of Christ that says Amen to every word you'll just never see those without a real surrendered heart and life saying Amen to every word of God requires deep resolve it not only that it it it it it brings a faith that is born of deep relationship with the Lord and it literally opens the windows of Heaven for you to build you literally have the ability to build your life into a Garden of Eden it doesn't matter what should befallen you or how much of a head start you didn't get how how hindered you've been how tripped you've ever been how how disadvantaged you've ever been I don't tell you something friends I've seen people go for decades and decades and decades and be midway through their life story and everything is chaos and wreckage and burning heaps behind them and give their life to God and God turn their life into a garden in three or four months just months God can erase 50 years in months Hallelujah I want to say to you young people don't even wait for him to need to do it that way make that decision now it's you know you you can make your life a Garden of Eden sure trials are going to come of course you know not every moment while we're marching design feels like a Garden of Eden right Believers not true I mean let's just be honest we have to be honest that not every moment marching distance just because I gave my life to the Lord for the rest of that actually makes you a Target but again it's a sum positive at the end of the day you have a net gain by doing it you're you have a net gain to have the Holy Ghost and fight the greatest battle ever fought then to not have the Holy Ghost and fight a lesser battle it's a Net game and so you know not but not every day we readily admit that that not every day marching you know in the in the admonition of the Lord feels like a Garden of Eden not every day you know and sometimes even many days you can go through as as Believers you can go through many reasons and and and you can actually walk many days through what feels more it's a Garden of Eden feels more like a wilderness feels more like I'm in a desert what are you talking about a Garden of Eden but I'm here to tell you even in the midst of Trials and troubles even if you're in that kind of a place the same faith that you had in the garden you'll have in the desert Hallelujah the same faith that you have in the garden you will have in the wilderness the same resolve that you have in good times it's still with you in the bad times the same determination that you have that you feel when blessings are pouring out is the same determination when you can't remember your last blessing I've been there I know what I speak of and all my trials and troubles today friends I find myself very honestly more determined today to press to the kingdom than I ever have before because I have found that the Lord is trustworthy The Trials come the troubles come the Wilderness part the Lord had to have a Wilderness part of his journey the church of Christ has had a Wilderness Journey for seven Church ages for 2 000 years but all the faith all the peace and all the trust remains with you no matter what there's nothing like being born again of the Holy Ghost brother Branham I want to come to this uh just just for a minute and I'm not going to get to my other part that's okay because I want to stop in four minutes so I'm going to read this quote and we're gonna stop and I'll pick it up at my next Family series let me just give you a little bit of background brother Adam comes to the seven Church ages and he's reading in the Book of Revelation where he hath made us Kings and Priests and without teaching on that tonight because it's an in-depth study I just want to say that your your um the the very grounds of your kingdom Authority is grounded in the fact that you're a priest amen remember do we agree Jesus is the king of all Kings but yet Melchizedek said thou art a priest forever and again I don't have time to go teaching on that tonight Melchizedek that story there in Genesis is the perfect type of the bride's ministry as brother Branham taught us so many times it's a type of the Bride the word made flesh in the ministry of the son of man but but it's all about being a priest because we're Kings toward Humanity remember brother Adam said God didn't make the Earth for him to rule he made the Earth for man to rule and the god rules the universe and in the Millennium we will be a kingdom of Kings and Priests and so we'll have a kingship Authority of of the king we will be the executors of his will will be the enforcers of his word will be the Sowers of his seed and and we're just talking about in the Millennium is just while it's still here on Earth because that's just a honeymoon but then we finally get to go home after the honeymoon uh and and and and that's not limited to the Earth see because what what God created was not just an earth he created a universe and worlds and worlds of Worlds and don't you think for a minute it's there just to look at and be pretty God has that for a reason of the increase of his kingdom there shall be no end of the increase of it so it's a Perpetual increasing they they say that they can't find the borders and parameters of the universe they think it may be even ever expanding and I just say that's good because an ever-expanding kingdom is going to need to never expanding universe but but that's how we're Kings but we're but the authority of our kingship what makes it look what legitimizes our our Authority is that we're priest unto God and brother Branham talks a little bit about priests and I if there's a lot more than what's in this quote but again I'm not going to go into that tonight I made next time probably will but brother Branham says in the seven Church ages he has made us priests did you ever know what a priest is now don't lose sight of this fact because I'm closing right here don't lose sight of this fact is that God has called you to be Kings right now and you say well what what's the job description what does that entail it means that you are to take authority over sin over the world over the Flesh and over the devil that's a lot of responsibility but I can tell you that you will never successfully do that outside of a a new birth because that's what empowers you and be a willingness to be a priest first uh a king over the world and sin and flesh and the devil Jesus said I've given you power over all the power of the devil because remember your power is original brother Branham said Satan's power is actually just a perversion of God's power you don't actually have any original Power did you know that you don't have any original Power it's a perversion of God's power you actually have authentic God power right so that's why Jesus could say I've given you power over all the power of the enemy in other words he's saying I've given you the kind of power that is more powerful than the power that the enemy has that makes sense don't lose sight of that next time he challenges you and and so we are Kings over flesh over sin over the world and over the devil because we are priest unto God because we intercede for the world for our family we lift up praises to God in worship we correct errors we we hear somebody say there's no such a thing as Divine Healing and we say no friend that's not true see I'm I'm I'm praising God I'm praising him to say that's not accurate let me teach you oh it's baptism and father Son and Holy Ghost no no sit down let's open our Bible see I'm being a priest see now watch here's another facet of it that's really going to hit home you ready seven Church ages 1954. he has made us priests did you ever know what a priest is what his office is a priest is to make sacrifice that's one to make intercession that's why he says and he quotes first Peter 2 9 where it calls us a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people see and then you'll notice that the prophet inverts the order and he says a holy nation peculiar people royal priesthood so your royal priesthood is is what is the authoritative Foundation of your kingship and the foundation of your priesthood is that you're To Be A peculiar people and a holy nation and that makes you an acceptable priest unto God offering hidden woman that comes to God enters into the veil that's a prerequisite that's the new birth if you want to be a king over the flesh the world the sin the devil then you've got to be a priest and if you want to be a real priest you've got to enter in Beyond the Veil where the Shekinah is what is it now spiritual sacrifices that is and he's going to name some categories he's going to give you some practical ways so you can really get it get your mind wrapped around what it means to be a priest because everybody loves power everybody loves Authority I'm a king I got power come here devil hold on you got to get the priest's part fixed first yeah see now otherwise the devil will laugh at you what is it now spiritual sacrifices that is here's one of them the fruit of our lips giving praise to his name so it you know I I witnessed it tonight I witnessed it Sunday you know a song leader comes up and starts singing and worship starts out across the building that's spiritual sacrifice see you could be using your pipes at a football game but you're instead you're here in church lifting praises to God that's why it's so that's why it's so embarrassing if the if the song leader has to Prime you and pump you see that that's not a priest all right brother I'm going to keep dealing with it he says now here's another facet of it all right here's one the fruit of our lips praising giving praise to his name now watch this when a little confusion comes in the church you don't run over to one side and pout you know if you do you need to get over yourself yeah he said when a little confusion comes in the church you don't run over one side and pout now if you are you sure ain't a priest see what I do brother Branham you pray through spiritual sacrifice the fruit of our lips giving praise to his name what's the spiritual fruit of my lips I'm praying through there's a confusion I don't pout I use my lips to pray through because why I'm a spiritual priest but they did me wrong right but you're a priest but I got a right to defend your priest but they need to get a peace of mind you're a priest somebody needs to die get a deacon you're a priest see you pray through the fruit of our lips giving praise to his name see what I mean while you say I just don't feel like going to church but you're a priest it's your duty you've got to be there you see listen friends Paul Paul talks about assembling yourselves more deceived the day approaching the evil day approaching so people who have slacked on their Church attendance either don't see the evil day approaching or they just don't they just don't have enough Faith to obey a prophet listen coming to church you're not coming here to get saved you're already saved you come here to get strength right you come here to get strength not to get saved you're already saved and you're you're in church everywhere you go but you come here with the Saints and the worship and the singing and the preaching to get cleaned up and tightened up and adjusted and strengthened John so so he says you say I I don't feel like going to church but you're a priest it's your duty you've got to be there well I just don't feel like taking a part in the service but you're a priest making a sacrifice a spiritual sacrifice when you see a Time coming that everybody blaspheming and saying these things and doing things wrong what do you do walk away you're supposed to stand there with a spiritual sacrifice saying the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses from all sin makes me a new creature in Christ Jesus and it's the power of God unto salvation I believe it what he says when you're confronting Blasphemous ways you say listen I believe in the power of God that this is what the Surgeon General needed to publish I thought that to myself this quote this is what this quote would do the nation in the world more good than all of his ten hun a thousand reports this is what he needs to publish this is what this is what the bride needs to keep our our assemblies moving to keep the Holy Spirit moving in our assemblies this is what we need to say I'm a spiritual priest this is what homes need this is what families need this is what this is what our this is what parents need to make sure that is in place that that the home is a place of spiritual sacrifice if it's not come back to the word if your assembly is God confusion come back to the mind of the word if your feelings have been heard cast it down come back to the mind of the word see this is exactly what the Lord uh needs to hear and that's when he can come in and do the most magical things that you more than you could even think to ask amen God bless you all you Kings and Priests let's stand we've got a couple of prayer requests I want to get to right away amen um um brother Matthew um the old song have thy known away Lord Have Thine Own Way Thou Art the Potter I Am the play find the words for that brother Bradley um brother Micah Curtis
