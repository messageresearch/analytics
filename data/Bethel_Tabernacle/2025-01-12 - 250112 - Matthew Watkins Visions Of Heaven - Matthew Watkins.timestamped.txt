[39:25] about but let me just say it's good news
[39:28] it's really good news it's you know the
[39:31] the the promise of the believer amen is
[39:34] really good news I want to speak to you
[39:37] and I'm going to title this visions of
[39:39] heaven or visions yes visions of Heaven
[39:43] 2 Corinthians chapter 12 then we'll read
[39:45] one more scripture in Matthew 6 and
[39:47] we'll let you be seated Paul says it's
[39:50] not expedient for me doubtless to Glory
[39:53] I will come to visions and Revelations
[39:55] of the Lord I knew a man in Christ above
[39:59] 14 years ago and this is the Apostle
[40:01] speaking of himself whether in the body
[40:04] I cannot tell or whe whether out of the
[40:07] body I cannot tell God knoweth such a
[40:10] one caught up to the third heaven and I
[40:13] knew such a man whether in the body or
[40:15] out of the body I cannot tell God
[40:17] knoweth how that he was called up into
[40:20] paradise and heard unspeakable Words
[40:24] which is not lawful for a man to utter
[40:27] of such a one will I Glory yet of myself
[40:29] I will not Glory but in my infirmities
[40:33] for though I would desire to Glory I
[40:35] shall not be a fool for I will say the
[40:37] truth for now I for forbear lest any man
[40:40] should think of me above that which he
[40:42] seeth me to be or that he heareth of me
[40:47] let's go to Matthew chapter 6 just turn
[40:49] back there in your Bible Matthew chapter
[40:53] 6 amen and let's just read it real
[40:56] familiar your
[40:59] scripture Matthew 6 and verse 19 through
[41:05] 21 Jesus says lay not up for yourself
[41:10] Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust
[41:14] doth corrupt and where thieves break
[41:17] through and steal but lay up for
[41:20] yourself Treasures in Heaven whether
[41:24] neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and
[41:27] where thieves do not break through nor
[41:30] steal for where your treasure
[41:33] is there will your heart be also Lord
[41:37] Jesus we just give you thanks One More
[41:40] Time Lord as we just open these words I
[41:43] can hear your Prophet say Lord one day
[41:46] we'll open this Bible for the last time
[41:49] one day Lord we'll sit in a church for
[41:51] the last time one day Lord God the last
[41:54] sermon will be preached could it be
[41:56] today today Lord could today Father be
[41:59] that last day we know there will be Lord
[42:02] if it is then God I just want to raise
[42:05] hands and say Jesus let your Holy Spirit
[42:08] scan every part of my being my body my
[42:12] soul my spirit Lord and if there would
[42:14] be anything that would be unlike you
[42:16] Lord would you purge it and take it from
[42:18] me just now God I pray that you would
[42:20] sanctify us Lord father I pray that your
[42:23] word would just come and speak to the
[42:25] hearts of your people let it Jesus we
[42:28] pray in Jesus name amen you can be
[42:30] seated
[42:38] amen these are real familiar words that
[42:41] we read here in Mark chapter 6 and uh I
[42:45] just want to pick up just here for a
[42:47] moment and we have some uh brother Mark
[42:51] or sister Esther you could put that up
[42:52] if you could just on the
[42:55] display we know that brother
[42:57] deals with this dimension of heaven and
[43:00] we could we we could look in many places
[43:02] throughout the Bible to speak about it
[43:05] and about life and where a person goes
[43:08] when they die I think it's amazing
[43:10] because you can see that you are as a
[43:12] person caught in between a dimension of
[43:16] heaven and a dimension of hell I love
[43:19] how brother Brandon makes it so simple
[43:21] and he says you are either influenced
[43:23] from heaven or you're influenced from
[43:26] Hell there's there's really no other
[43:28] influence that comes there's only two
[43:29] places that a person can dwell and that
[43:32] is either when they die and that is
[43:33] either heaven or hell and all influences
[43:36] in life come from either place even
[43:40] brother brandham would break down angels
[43:42] and beings and creatures that we don't
[43:44] have you know all we have is depictions
[43:46] of imagery and pictures with wings and
[43:48] things like that using descriptors that
[43:51] the Bible gives us but even the Bible
[43:53] says that Paul says that uh I hath not
[43:56] seen
[43:57] Nor Ear heard uh neither has it even
[44:00] entered the heart of man the things
[44:03] which God hath prepared for them who
[44:05] love him and so we know that the battle
[44:08] that we're in is a very spiritual battle
[44:11] it's a very it's a it's a it's a it's
[44:13] not a flesh and blood struggle but our
[44:16] life is caught between two dimensions a
[44:19] dimension or we could say voices or
[44:22] visions from heaven and also would be on
[44:25] display visions from hell I think it's
[44:29] amazing because you can think of this
[44:32] this this uh this this life and the life
[44:35] that we live and the breaths that we're
[44:38] breathing that one day we'll breathe our
[44:40] last breath on this side of Eternity and
[44:43] I know it's not a I know it's not a very
[44:45] popular or you should not even shouldn't
[44:47] say popular but it's not a very uh
[44:50] comfortable subject that we like to
[44:52] speak about when we talk about death but
[44:54] I think it's amazing that it takes the
[44:56] death of of someone for us to
[44:58] contemplate how fragile life
[45:02] is and how fleeting really life is uh
[45:06] you you you know even your steps the the
[45:09] Bible talks about that the footsteps of
[45:11] the righteous are ordered of the Lord
[45:14] that means God's in control of your life
[45:17] he's in control of your steps that you
[45:19] take he ordained your first step on
[45:22] Earth he ordained the age that you would
[45:24] live in he he ordained the family you
[45:27] would be born in he ordained the
[45:29] struggles that he would put in your
[45:31] human vessel that you would have to
[45:33] overcome because God as he said about
[45:35] Moses god equipped Moses for everything
[45:38] Moses needed was already inside of him
[45:42] right and so we look at this and and our
[45:44] life is even just a moment away even
[45:47] here today this morning as I speak and
[45:50] it just as I just want you to to let it
[45:52] Dawn on you the way that it dawned on me
[45:56] that after today that this could be your
[45:59] last day on this side of
[46:02] Eternity think about that just for a
[46:04] moment that that someone could walk out
[46:07] these Church doors for the last time
[46:10] there will be a last time and life is
[46:14] just that way it's it's so fragile David
[46:16] begin to contemplate this and and he and
[46:19] he realized that his life was so fragile
[46:22] and it was so fleeting it's a really
[46:24] profound thought when you think about
[46:25] that that in this this moment here you
[46:28] could be on this in this dimension of
[46:30] Earth in between influences and then in
[46:32] the next moment when you walk out the
[46:35] door you don't know what's waiting for
[46:36] you down the road uh uh you know not to
[46:39] not to uh you know to think in some kind
[46:41] of Bleak you know dark way but sometimes
[46:44] we ought to contemplate that of how
[46:46] fragile our life really is and and and
[46:50] let me just say this that the only way
[46:52] that you can go to heaven how many want
[46:54] to go to heaven there's only one way to
[46:56] go to to heaven and that's
[46:58] death now think of that just for for a
[47:01] moment the only way for you to go to
[47:03] heaven is that you die the Apostle Paul
[47:07] in 1 Corinthians 12 begins to talk about
[47:09] the distinctions of bodies he talks
[47:11] about the Earthly body body and how that
[47:14] it's made of Flesh and fleshy and and he
[47:17] talks about the body of animals and the
[47:19] body of different creatures and creation
[47:21] then he talks about the bodies of heaven
[47:23] and he points to the stars and he points
[47:25] to the moon and the planets in the in
[47:27] the atmosphere and he says those are the
[47:30] bodies of heaven but the bodies of of of
[47:33] of the heavens but he says then there's
[47:35] the spiritual body Paul says it's a
[47:37] theophany body a body not made with
[47:40] hands one that's prepared for you
[47:43] Eternal in the Heavens to be absent he
[47:46] says from the Lord is to be present to
[47:49] be absent from the body is to be present
[47:52] with the Lord and so there's only one
[47:54] way out of here we're all going to face
[47:57] death in one way or another say brother
[47:59] Matt well I believe that I'll you know
[48:01] go into translation aren't you uh
[48:03] leaving off first Thessalonians 4 you
[48:05] know aren't you leaving off that there
[48:07] will be a Rapture no I'm not leaving any
[48:09] part of that you see all of us will die
[48:12] some of us will die a mortal death where
[48:14] we breathe our last breath in this
[48:16] Mortal body others as brother brandham
[48:19] said that Cocker that's made up and he
[48:22] said that seed Gene of God is inside of
[48:25] that Cocker life and he says now that
[48:28] cockabur the body on the outside is not
[48:31] the germ of life it's just a vehicle
[48:33] it's just a holder of the real you of
[48:36] who you really are but he says one day
[48:39] you'll bury that cocko Barrow enough
[48:41] either PL it in the
[48:44] ground or you bury it with the word and
[48:48] brother bandam says and you bury that
[48:50] with the word and with the word and with
[48:51] the word to one day what is the
[48:53] translation or the body change it's this
[48:56] body becoming so under control of the
[48:59] Holy Spirit and so dead to the things of
[49:02] the world and this atmosphere in lady AA
[49:05] that the body changes from to what the
[49:07] soul represents on the inside of you
[49:09] which is who you really are before the
[49:11] foundation of the world and so the only
[49:14] way out of this life is death can you
[49:16] say Amen the only way out of this life
[49:19] is death I want to say it as as clear
[49:22] and as plain and I'm just feeling the
[49:24] weight of this sermon as I preach it
[49:26] today I want to say it as clear as I've
[49:28] ever said it before the only way out of
[49:31] this life is
[49:35] death imagine that imagine just for a
[49:39] moment because it's taken the life of
[49:41] many people young young people that
[49:44] never thought that they would be dead or
[49:48] gone from this life before they turned
[49:50] 25 years old 18 years old before they
[49:54] ever turned 18 they they never would
[49:56] have imag IM that their life would come
[49:58] to an untimely death or a tragic end
[50:01] whatever you want to call it you think
[50:03] of how many people get up every day and
[50:05] we live life and go through the motions
[50:07] of life and go through the motions of
[50:09] what we call you know almost like
[50:11] autopilot what we do every day in our
[50:13] daily rout routines am amen and we never
[50:17] imagine you never imagine you know you
[50:20] never imagine that but let me just say
[50:22] death can come suddenly death can come
[50:25] instantly death can come unexpectedly at
[50:28] any moment and I just want to say as I
[50:31] say it under the inspiration of the Holy
[50:33] Ghost are you ready to
[50:37] die amen are you ready can we ask
[50:41] ourself that question this morning on
[50:44] this Sunday morning beautiful day in
[50:47] January are you ready should you breathe
[50:50] your last breath on this side as brother
[50:53] bam says when you breathe that last
[50:55] breath you don't go Million Miles Away
[50:58] you simply change dimensions and what
[51:01] you are here is what you are there and
[51:05] he says the only thing that you'll take
[51:07] is your
[51:09] character the only thing that you'll
[51:11] take is the character that's been molded
[51:14] In You by submitting and repenting by
[51:17] submitting and repenting by submitting
[51:19] and repenting you see that's the life of
[51:22] a Believer the life of a Believer is
[51:24] repenting and submitting and repenting
[51:27] and submitting and I don't say Lord I
[51:29] want to die as Paul said daily I want to
[51:32] repent and submit to the word of God and
[51:36] so it comes unexpectedly it can come
[51:38] very suddenly and it doesn't take a
[51:41] there's no how can I say this it it
[51:43] doesn't it doesn't there's death is no
[51:45] respector of persons kings die Queens
[51:48] die rich die poor die the educated die
[51:52] the uneducated die the college educated
[51:55] the Theologian doesn't doesn't matter
[51:57] who you are or what your status is or
[52:00] who your friends are or who the club
[52:02] that you you're part of who your dad is
[52:04] who your mom is what your last name is
[52:07] it doesn't matter how much money you
[52:08] have in the bank it doesn't matter how
[52:11] healthy you are how strong you are how
[52:13] much you can brinch press come on
[52:15] somebody amen amen death doesn't
[52:22] discriminate and one day Hebrews 9: 27
[52:26] says it is appointed once unto man to
[52:30] die and then after the Judgment we will
[52:34] answer I I just want to stop here for a
[52:37] moment because I'm just feeling the the
[52:39] breakes of the Holy
[52:41] Spirit sometimes the holy spirit says
[52:44] go other times it just says stop here
[52:46] for a moment amen all of us will stand
[52:50] Paul says and give an
[52:53] account to God for the life
[52:56] that we
[52:59] lived all of us will stand and give an
[53:03] account all of us will stand before the
[53:06] Judgment seat of
[53:08] Christ some will stand before a white
[53:11] Throne judgment others will stand before
[53:14] the Judgment seat of Christ which is the
[53:16] word judging your life now I want to
[53:20] stand
[53:21] now I don't want to stand there I want
[53:24] to stand now and I know not preaching
[53:27] this today but I I'll just say it here
[53:29] again as I said last Sunday everybody
[53:31] will either come under the anointing of
[53:34] The Sixth Seal which is tribulation or
[53:36] the seventh seal which is the coming of
[53:39] the Lord all Humanity will fall under
[53:42] one of those two seals can you say
[53:47] amen and so we know this that all of us
[53:50] will stand there on that day and nothing
[53:54] nothing you can do nothing nothing no
[53:57] good gift no good work no good track
[54:01] record nothing can get you access into
[54:04] heaven uh let me say Church uh what
[54:07] church you're part of won't get you into
[54:10] heaven your status in life even me as a
[54:13] minister of the Gospel will not give me
[54:16] access into heaven come on somebody
[54:19] doesn't matter your money won't get you
[54:21] into heaven your your education won't
[54:24] get you into heaven how good and how
[54:26] much much you know the Bible won't get
[54:28] you into heaven how much you know the
[54:29] message won't get you into heaven
[54:31] there's one thing that will get you into
[54:33] heaven and that is the blood of Jesus
[54:36] Christ and it washes the Violet sinner
[54:39] clean it takes the darkest and the
[54:41] coldest and the the most hopeless and it
[54:45] transforms their life oh my brother my
[54:48] sister what we need is not a Reformation
[54:50] to make better people and better looking
[54:53] and better dress code and better
[54:54] Behavior we don't need a formation I say
[54:57] we need a transformation that starts in
[55:00] the very soul and the heart of a man who
[55:03] says God I'm willing to repent and
[55:06] submit yes
[55:08] Lord yes
[55:10] Lord there is no other way there is no
[55:13] other life there is no other name
[55:15] whereby men can be saved but the name of
[55:19] Jesus
[55:20] Christ Jesus said he says I go to
[55:23] prepare a place it's a real place uh he
[55:27] says he says you you you believe in God
[55:30] believe also in me behold I go to
[55:32] prepare a place and in my father's house
[55:35] are many mansions what's he doing he's
[55:38] describing using the scriptures to say
[55:40] this is a very real place it's not a
[55:42] figment of your imagination it's not
[55:45] something that you just dreamed up or
[55:47] something you've seen in a movie or
[55:49] something that you're you know that you
[55:50] just imagine in your mind but I want you
[55:53] to think here just for a moment that
[55:55] heaven is a very real place it has real
[55:58] people there's real mountains There's
[56:00] real valleys there's there's a real Sky
[56:03] there's a real there's there there there
[56:05] there's roads come on somebody there's
[56:08] roads there there there's there's
[56:11] highways it's a very real place Paul
[56:14] says I have not seen nor ear heard
[56:19] neither has it even listen neither has
[56:22] it even entered the heart of
[56:24] man what's he say and use your wildest
[56:28] imagination
[56:30] amen and you still wouldn't be able to
[56:33] Fathom what awaits those I'm talking
[56:37] about those who are believers who are
[56:40] who die in this life but they die a
[56:43] Christian amen they go into a place of
[56:47] rest Paul says that that uh uh Jesus
[56:50] says it that way it's a place of rest
[56:53] it's a place where he says I go to
[56:55] prepare let me just say there's a life
[56:57] that's beyond this
[57:00] life there's a dimension that's beyond
[57:02] this
[57:04] Dimension and in this Dimension we live
[57:06] with time and I
[57:09] forgot thank you Lord I'm going to set
[57:12] it for less than an hour I won't tell
[57:14] you how much less but I'm going to set
[57:17] it for less than an
[57:20] hour you love him praise God and so
[57:24] notice this here
[57:29] it's a real place I I I just want to
[57:31] stop here for a moment and just pause
[57:33] here for a
[57:35] second and I want to come to my slides
[57:37] if you have that sister you could you
[57:39] could display that and I'll be able to
[57:40] control it from
[57:42] here because before we can talk about
[57:45] heaven we must also talk about hell If
[57:48] Heaven is a very real place hell is
[57:51] every bit as much as real even brother
[57:54] bandham says that about the core of the
[57:56] earth and underneath us he says you know
[57:58] just underneath us is fire that's
[58:00] belching and the core of the earth you
[58:02] know coming from the Sun and and and you
[58:05] know and and and and all of that that it
[58:07] is and he but he says that you know that
[58:09] it's a it's a very real place even in
[58:12] Ephesians 6 you know the bi the the
[58:14] scripture very well when Paul says we
[58:16] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[58:19] against principalities against Powers
[58:21] against rulers of Darkness against
[58:24] wickedness and he uses these words
[58:26] in high places that word is not altitude
[58:29] that is not height like up in the
[58:31] heavens but actually if you go and look
[58:33] at the meaning of that word it is
[58:35] speaking that our battle that we wrestle
[58:38] against is in high atmospheres or other
[58:41] dimensions other environments other
[58:44] other worlds that are Beyond this world
[58:46] that we see with our five senses Beyond
[58:49] just the brother bam would say just
[58:51] beyond the the realm of the chasm of
[58:54] this life and he he goes and he says
[58:56] that them over there on the other side
[58:58] he says sight is not exactly as we think
[59:01] it is as we see here with our own eyes
[59:03] but he says the contact that they have
[59:05] through sight is so much greater than
[59:08] anything that we have here it's a real
[59:10] Dimension it's a real environment we
[59:12] spoke last time about that fourth
[59:14] dimension how that that fourth dimension
[59:16] was representative of Science and
[59:19] diseases flow through that Dimension
[59:21] television R radio waves even through
[59:24] even e you know even uh technology and
[59:27] and flows through that fourth dimension
[59:29] brother bam says that was the traveling
[59:31] or communication Dimension where Spirits
[59:34] could travel it's something that you
[59:36] can't see as brother digs preached it's
[59:38] something you can't hear you can't you
[59:40] can't because you can't tune into that
[59:42] but brother bham would say that even
[59:44] Jesus Christ the son of God who died for
[59:47] your sins is standing there with his
[59:50] arms outstretched and brother bam says
[59:52] if you could ever get so in tune with
[59:55] God you'd see the appearance of
[59:58] Jesus and so it's a very real place it's
[1:00:01] a dimension man lives in this
[1:00:04] multi-dimensional environment and so we
[1:00:06] know that the struggles that come to us
[1:00:08] in life are not human they're not they
[1:00:11] may have human uh you know attributes
[1:00:14] you may have very substantive things
[1:00:16] that you could talk about and so uh yes
[1:00:19] thank you brother Brad thank you for
[1:00:21] reminding me that I did not send my
[1:00:23] slides this morning that's okay I'll get
[1:00:25] them sent really quick I'm not a good
[1:00:26] multitasker so you'll just have to bear
[1:00:28] with me here just for a moment um thank
[1:00:31] you Lord you love him amen amen and so
[1:00:35] notice this here it's a very real
[1:00:38] Dimension as let me make sure this is
[1:00:40] corrected as it'll be called something
[1:00:41] else but you can just display it it's
[1:00:43] fine it's a very real place so Paul says
[1:00:46] our our battle is not against flesh and
[1:00:49] blood but against princes and
[1:00:51] principalities and rulers of Darkness of
[1:00:54] this present world and then Paul says so
[1:00:57] you're to do what you're to take on the
[1:00:59] full armor of God so that you can
[1:01:03] withstand the battle that is Raging the
[1:01:06] one that you can't see now I know a lot
[1:01:09] of times we put flesh and blood on it we
[1:01:12] put you know addictions you think of
[1:01:14] people that are addicted to alcohol and
[1:01:17] then you treat that as a very
[1:01:19] substantive problem and so what will you
[1:01:21] do for that person you'll do everything
[1:01:23] you can if all you have to deal with is
[1:01:25] just the flesh and blood disease uh
[1:01:27] whether it's cancer doesn't matter what
[1:01:29] disease it is brother bam says what do
[1:01:31] doctors do they use their medicines they
[1:01:34] use chemo they use instruments that God
[1:01:36] has given them and brother bam says and
[1:01:39] if they can fully eradicate that
[1:01:41] sickness then praise God that's
[1:01:43] wonderful and he says but beyond that
[1:01:46] outward physical battle or physical
[1:01:49] tumor if you want to call it cancer and
[1:01:51] he says living on the inside of that is
[1:01:53] a supernatural being called an angel
[1:01:57] that has fallen from heaven and he's a
[1:01:59] demon spirit that is now living on the
[1:02:03] life and that life or that person is
[1:02:05] just the host or the house that he lives
[1:02:08] in now if it's that way with cancer
[1:02:11] wouldn't it be the same way with
[1:02:12] depression wouldn't it be the same way
[1:02:14] with anxiety wouldn't it be the same way
[1:02:17] with sex or pornography or drugs it
[1:02:19] doesn't matter what what what you want
[1:02:21] to name here today malice Envy jealousy
[1:02:24] Strife cont ition don't you know that
[1:02:27] Paul said for those things will not
[1:02:29] enter the Kingdom of Heaven murdering
[1:02:32] Envy malice hatred he puts hatred and
[1:02:35] Malice right there with
[1:02:37] murdering and so all of those things are
[1:02:40] only outward
[1:02:42] manifestations of an inward struggle or
[1:02:44] battle that is taking place in the in
[1:02:47] inside of a human vessel and then we
[1:02:50] call it alcoholism so then we give them
[1:02:53] self-help book and Alcoholics Anonymous
[1:02:55] and AA and all of those things nothing
[1:02:57] wrong if that's all the tools that you
[1:02:59] have to fight with and that's you better
[1:03:01] use what you got but I'm so glad God
[1:03:04] didn't just stop with human me men men's
[1:03:07] instruments and men's tools because many
[1:03:09] times doctors don't have an answer for
[1:03:12] cancer many times they don't have
[1:03:14] anything to say but go home and prepare
[1:03:16] your things because your life is going
[1:03:18] to end I'm so glad that my life is not
[1:03:21] in the hands of a doctor it's not in the
[1:03:23] hands of medicine it's not in the hands
[1:03:25] of science but my life is in the hands
[1:03:28] of Jesus and until he says it's over
[1:03:31] Satan can't even touch me Hallelujah you
[1:03:34] ought to rejoice in that
[1:03:36] today and May so we we use many
[1:03:39] different tools and instruments that we
[1:03:41] have to try to help the problem but what
[1:03:43] we need to recognize is that it's not a
[1:03:46] flesh and blood
[1:03:48] issue it is actually a supernatural
[1:03:51] battle that because of unbelief cuz
[1:03:54] brother Adam said that was the only only
[1:03:56] way the devil could have access to a
[1:03:58] Believer it's through the channel of
[1:04:01] doubt and he uses fear and oh boy does
[1:04:05] he ever use fear amen and he generates
[1:04:09] pictures images things that have never
[1:04:12] taken place oh yes and he used this fear
[1:04:15] in our mind of what would happen maybe
[1:04:18] what's waiting down for you and you know
[1:04:20] come on friends I'm not the only one who
[1:04:21] does that
[1:04:22] to you know you get a little pain in
[1:04:25] your body and and something weird and
[1:04:27] you you immediately like the devil just
[1:04:29] starts big creating an entire story of
[1:04:31] how your life's going to
[1:04:34] end and it because it's from another
[1:04:37] atmosphere it's from a we used this here
[1:04:39] you know the other day it's a demonic
[1:04:41] real I love chat GTP for what it can be
[1:04:44] used for good things I said chat create
[1:04:46] me an image of a demonic satanic Army
[1:04:49] that was bound at the river Euphrates in
[1:04:51] Revelations 9 and poof this came up like
[1:04:54] it did a pretty good job
[1:04:56] amen I showed that had that but before
[1:04:59] me that winter you or chat I realized
[1:05:01] after a while it was really getting some
[1:05:02] young people you know they staring at
[1:05:04] the image but this is what the devil
[1:05:07] does he creates and generates images in
[1:05:09] our mind things that have never taken
[1:05:11] place things are stories that will never
[1:05:14] unfold but the devil's job is to get you
[1:05:17] to believe them and then live in them
[1:05:20] and it's something that will never
[1:05:22] happen in your life it's something that
[1:05:24] will never oh you're God's you know
[1:05:26] what's going to happen because you did
[1:05:27] this and Satan begins to argue and
[1:05:29] begins to ra you know wrestle with your
[1:05:31] mind oh because you did now you got
[1:05:33] cancer now that's going to happen now
[1:05:35] your child's going to leave you yeah
[1:05:36] this is going to take place that child
[1:05:38] you know because you did this and you
[1:05:39] did that they'll never come to God
[1:05:41] they'll never serve the Lord you know
[1:05:42] you'll die in that condition you know
[1:05:44] this is what the devil does he generates
[1:05:47] and paints pictures and he reads dramas
[1:05:49] and stories and then we believe
[1:05:53] them and if we don't ever believe them
[1:05:55] then we start to commune with them in
[1:05:58] such a way to where it affects our
[1:06:00] attitude it affects our worship it
[1:06:02] affects how we treat other people come
[1:06:06] on and we get depressed and we get
[1:06:09] anxiety and then we go on
[1:06:11] pills and all the while it was never a
[1:06:14] flesh and blood struggle it was a
[1:06:17] supernatural battle taking place in
[1:06:20] another
[1:06:22] dimension Paul says we wrestle not
[1:06:24] against flesh and blood but against
[1:06:27] principalities so you can look at
[1:06:28] addictions and think the problem is
[1:06:30] physical but it's not it's in another
[1:06:32] dimension it's in an underworld because
[1:06:34] it's a demon Spirit that's been given
[1:06:36] access through unbelief in that person's
[1:06:38] Spirit through some stronghold Maybe by
[1:06:40] doing something brother man said how do
[1:06:42] they get there brother Matt Maybe by you
[1:06:44] looking at the wrong thing and
[1:06:45] continuing to look and continuing to
[1:06:47] look and continuing to look and then you
[1:06:50] like Eve stick your head out from the
[1:06:52] protection of the word
[1:06:55] and then Satan builds a complex and then
[1:06:58] he uses that complex to infect the
[1:07:00] entire life and he'll destroy you if he
[1:07:02] can listen friends I realized a long
[1:07:04] time ago the devil can never take me out
[1:07:06] of Heaven because my soul's already been
[1:07:08] translated there and one day my body
[1:07:11] will be there but what he will try to do
[1:07:13] is destroy my life here on Earth so that
[1:07:16] I can't serve him in the way that God's
[1:07:19] ordain me to serve
[1:07:22] him and so we as Believers need to
[1:07:25] understand these aren't Flesh and Blood
[1:07:26] issues drugs addictions and you take
[1:07:29] that person who tries so hard to
[1:07:32] overcome that yet they go back to it and
[1:07:35] you try to help them and you try to help
[1:07:37] them you do everything you pour some of
[1:07:39] your life into them praying for them
[1:07:42] believing for them and if you could if
[1:07:45] you could you would deliver them of that
[1:07:48] drug addiction amen if you could you
[1:07:52] would push a button and it'll all be
[1:07:54] gone no different than you would cancer
[1:07:56] or any other kind of disease that's
[1:07:57] right yeah amen but the way that God has
[1:08:00] so structured it it takes the
[1:08:05] individual it takes the person with
[1:08:09] their own free moral agency his brother
[1:08:11] brandham is praying for a man and
[1:08:15] he you can go and listen to one of the
[1:08:17] most powerful sermons uh I'm TR trying
[1:08:20] to remember the name I was just
[1:08:21] listening to it the evidence of of maybe
[1:08:24] it was the presence of God recognized
[1:08:26] and brother Adam comes to to that prayer
[1:08:29] line and he begins to talk to his sister
[1:08:31] and he and and he just stops right in
[1:08:33] the middle of of of discernment and he
[1:08:35] gets real soft somber and he says sister
[1:08:37] and he goes and grabs her by the hand
[1:08:39] and he says you got cancer and yes yes
[1:08:42] he says now Sister oh it's much worse
[1:08:44] than you think it
[1:08:46] is and he says and God can deliver you
[1:08:48] of that and he said now I can pray for
[1:08:50] you and he says and I could actually
[1:08:52] take that cancer and destroy it out of
[1:08:55] your life
[1:08:55] life and he says but I can't keep it
[1:08:59] gone am amen it'll take you confessing I
[1:09:04] am I will I do believe that Jesus heals
[1:09:08] me now it'll take your confession to
[1:09:11] hold on to that healing that God gives
[1:09:13] you praise God and so this is the way
[1:09:16] God designed it even in Jude we can look
[1:09:18] through this and you could find this
[1:09:20] that this is a real spiritual battle a
[1:09:22] real army we use this picture here to
[1:09:24] describe that just as there's an army of
[1:09:27] of demons I love this so much because in
[1:09:30] Revelations 9 we read it the other day
[1:09:32] and it and it depicted these uh what do
[1:09:35] we read 200,000,000 200 million demons
[1:09:39] you say brother Matt that sounds like a
[1:09:40] lot of demon Spirits yeah but I want you
[1:09:42] to catch something they have a number
[1:09:45] they're numbered there's actually a
[1:09:47] quantity but did you know the Bible
[1:09:49] doesn't give a quantity to
[1:09:52] angels in other words that may sound
[1:09:54] massive but my God Is Bigger the angels
[1:09:57] and the armies of the Living God are
[1:10:05] innumerable and David says he's the Army
[1:10:07] he's the god the Lord of hosts that word
[1:10:12] means the God of angels or the God of
[1:10:14] Angel Armies Hallelujah and so notice
[1:10:18] this here this is this is what you find
[1:10:20] even in the book of Jude you find this
[1:10:22] in Ezekiel and it speaks about Lucifer
[1:10:24] says you were the signant of perfection
[1:10:26] let me pull it up on mine says you were
[1:10:28] the signant of perfection full of wisdom
[1:10:31] perfect and Beauty you were e in the
[1:10:33] garden of God every precious stone was
[1:10:34] your covering you were an anointed
[1:10:36] Guardian cherub I placed you you were on
[1:10:39] the Holy Mountain of God in the midst of
[1:10:41] the stones of fire you walked you were
[1:10:43] blameless in your ways from the day you
[1:10:46] were created until unrighteousness was
[1:10:50] found in you so this is who your enemy
[1:10:54] is
[1:10:56] he was an anointed
[1:10:58] cherub you know brother mam says a lot
[1:11:01] about this in and greatest battle ever
[1:11:02] fall I could just preach a whole sermon
[1:11:04] on that but it was the anointed
[1:11:07] cherub you you say what is a demon
[1:11:10] spirit it's just a fallen angel even
[1:11:13] Jude speaks of this here and you know
[1:11:16] the scripture really well it says and
[1:11:18] the angels who did not stay within their
[1:11:21] own positions that King James says who
[1:11:25] did not keep their first
[1:11:27] estate of authority but left their
[1:11:31] proper dwelling he has kept in Eternal
[1:11:35] chains under gloomy Darkness until the
[1:11:39] Judgment of the great day amen did you
[1:11:42] know that even as there's angels that
[1:11:45] are
[1:11:46] Supernatural and then there's angels
[1:11:49] that are very natural as the Bible says
[1:11:52] Messengers and brother Adam picks that
[1:11:54] up about Messengers
[1:11:56] and he says notice unto the angel of the
[1:11:59] Church of Sardis right so you have you
[1:12:02] you have to realize that the Bible
[1:12:04] speaks of angelic supernatural beings as
[1:12:08] Angels but it also speaks of
[1:12:11] men who are messengers listen friends
[1:12:15] when you are carrying the message of God
[1:12:18] to people you are an angel messenger
[1:12:21] amen amen listen sometimes we it's not
[1:12:24] an Angel like a supernatural being but
[1:12:26] Angel simply means
[1:12:29] messenger and so a demon just as a
[1:12:32] person can be a messenger for the throne
[1:12:35] of God so also can people become Angels
[1:12:40] or let me tell you how the Apostle Paul
[1:12:42] says it he says even Satan does
[1:12:45] transform his
[1:12:47] Messengers into angels of
[1:12:51] light say who who are they some can be
[1:12:55] preaches yes that's
[1:12:57] right hello amen some can be people even
[1:13:02] brother Bandon when he talks about in
[1:13:04] Revelations 12 and it speaks about the
[1:13:06] dragon who was cast out the Michael the
[1:13:09] Archangel and all of this war that took
[1:13:12] place in heaven and then you go read
[1:13:14] Revelations 12 and it says and the
[1:13:16] dragon Drew with his tail and it took a
[1:13:20] third part of the angels of the Stars
[1:13:24] right amen hello somebody read your
[1:13:27] Bible do I have it there yeah it was
[1:13:29] Revelations 129 the Great Dragon was
[1:13:31] thrown down the ancient serpent but
[1:13:33] notice this pick this up here he says
[1:13:35] and the Great Dragon with it who's the
[1:13:38] dragon Lucifer the devil the serpent the
[1:13:41] enemy the anointed
[1:13:44] cherub don't think of a ghoulish you
[1:13:46] know kind kind of creature these are
[1:13:49] just descriptors the dragon it was his
[1:13:53] description but the Bible says he drew a
[1:13:56] third part of the stars with his tail
[1:14:00] but brother Brandon picks it up under
[1:14:01] prophetic vision and says it wasn't his
[1:14:03] t a i l it was his t a l
[1:14:08] e because it was his tail it was what he
[1:14:11] preached to them to get them to believe
[1:14:14] in brother ROM says an angel has free
[1:14:16] moral agency and it chose to believe
[1:14:19] Lucifer's
[1:14:21] lie and you know who brother brandham
[1:14:23] calls those third part he says notice
[1:14:25] Abraham's promise that your seed shall
[1:14:27] be as the stars of the heavens they're
[1:14:30] innumerable and your seed shall possess
[1:14:32] the Gate of your enemy and brother
[1:14:34] Brandon says notice who those stars were
[1:14:36] they were sons of Abraham and the dragon
[1:14:39] because he told them his tale is t l e
[1:14:43] he deceived a third part of the stars of
[1:14:46] Abraham and brother bham says it was
[1:14:48] those sons of Abraham who crucified
[1:14:52] Jesus was the third part of the stars of
[1:14:56] Heaven that Revelations 9 speaking of
[1:14:59] Amen so people listen people not talking
[1:15:04] to this about angels and demons
[1:15:05] somewhere in another dimension but those
[1:15:08] Spirits influence people and those
[1:15:11] people become messengers of God or
[1:15:14] messengers of Satan that's right
[1:15:18] amen second Peter two for if God did not
[1:15:21] spare Angels when they sin but cast them
[1:15:23] into hell and commit them in to change
[1:15:24] of Darkness to be kept into the Judgment
[1:15:27] the Great Dragon we read about it was
[1:15:28] cast down and so this is the the battle
[1:15:31] that that that is Raging this is what's
[1:15:34] taking place it's a it's a just for a
[1:15:37] moment a vision of heaven and a vision
[1:15:39] of Hell two influences and your life is
[1:15:43] caught in the middle amen and you will
[1:15:45] decide not if you will be influenced by
[1:15:48] an Angel you'll only decide what angel
[1:15:51] will influence you cuz you will under
[1:15:55] the influence of one or the
[1:15:58] other and notice this here as brother
[1:16:01] bam says light matter time and brother
[1:16:04] man begins to break down the seven
[1:16:05] dimensions and he says now light matter
[1:16:08] time our five senses even light being
[1:16:11] something that Thomas Edison didn't
[1:16:13] discover was electricity it was the
[1:16:15] electromagnetic field discovered way
[1:16:18] before him men knew even by lightning
[1:16:20] what was light it was something greater
[1:16:23] than what man could even today they
[1:16:25] don't they you can't harness the power
[1:16:28] in in the way that the the way that God
[1:16:31] ordained or designed it from the
[1:16:33] beginning we only have scratched the
[1:16:36] surface yes amen and the that what you
[1:16:38] see in this world with light light bulbs
[1:16:41] and lightning and and and and and all of
[1:16:44] those things are only a just a a shadow
[1:16:47] of what the real is so brother B says
[1:16:50] light matter and time and our five
[1:16:51] senses contact them dimensions and
[1:16:54] listen to what he say here brother digs
[1:16:55] read this on Wednesday night and our
[1:16:57] feeling contacts matter and so forth now
[1:17:00] but we have contact through science the
[1:17:02] fourth
[1:17:03] dimension as it was becoming because
[1:17:05] coming right through this P building
[1:17:07] right now comes pictures voices of radio
[1:17:09] we heard that and I won't do it again
[1:17:12] the Dick's phone playing the music but
[1:17:14] it's there all the
[1:17:15] time I want you to wake up to a reality
[1:17:19] here today that the voice of influence
[1:17:21] from hell is there all the time
[1:17:26] but I want you to also Rejoice that the
[1:17:28] influence and the vision and the voice
[1:17:30] from Heaven is there all the
[1:17:33] time brother Ram says notice what is
[1:17:36] that feeling that you get sometimes and
[1:17:38] you just do the wrong thing you don't
[1:17:40] know where it came from that came from
[1:17:42] an influence from hell and if you listen
[1:17:45] to that as James 2 says when lust every
[1:17:48] man is tempted when he is Led away after
[1:17:51] his own lust he's enticed but then when
[1:17:55] that's that's one thing none of us can
[1:17:57] can can get rid of that but you can stop
[1:17:59] it right there because then the Bible
[1:18:01] says but then when lust has conceived it
[1:18:04] brings forth sin and When sin is
[1:18:06] finished it brings forth death and so
[1:18:08] light matter in time our senses we have
[1:18:11] contact through the fourth dimension cuz
[1:18:13] coming right through this room right
[1:18:15] through this building right now is the
[1:18:17] voices of people and listen what brother
[1:18:19] vam says he says you ever feel that
[1:18:20] feeling you know you make a mistake and
[1:18:23] you don't even know where that came from
[1:18:24] he says then you notice other times
[1:18:25] you're in church and the the maybe just
[1:18:28] the music maybe just the singing maybe
[1:18:30] you're singing you know as brother Tony
[1:18:32] was singing it today all my life you
[1:18:35] have been faithful all my life you have
[1:18:38] been so so good your goodness is running
[1:18:41] and brother man says you feel that
[1:18:42] atmosphere you feel that he says all of
[1:18:44] the sudden out of nowhere you just feels
[1:18:47] like you just want to cry maybe at the
[1:18:49] preaching of the word and he says
[1:18:50] there's a something in you that's just
[1:18:52] belching just coming out and he says you
[1:18:55] just want to cry other times you want to
[1:18:57] shout it'd do you some good sometimes if
[1:18:59] you
[1:19:00] did sometimes you just want to get out
[1:19:02] of your seat and stand up and raise your
[1:19:04] hands and say Amen to the word of God
[1:19:07] brother B says what is that he says
[1:19:10] that's that other Angelic Dimension and
[1:19:13] you're bumping into
[1:19:15] it and he says what is it it's Angels
[1:19:18] trying to energize your
[1:19:21] faith he says they have a tube or
[1:19:23] Crystal that pick fix that up and he
[1:19:26] says so you see right in this building
[1:19:28] right now is live actions of people
[1:19:31] voices they're here we know it they're
[1:19:33] absolute the truth the only thing you do
[1:19:34] is they catch it I understand the
[1:19:35] mechanics of those things science has
[1:19:37] invented but we know that it proves us
[1:19:39] there's a fourth dimension let me get
[1:19:41] through some of this now The Fifth
[1:19:43] Dimension is where the sinner the
[1:19:45] unbeliever dies and goes to so brother
[1:19:50] Baron takes a long time to break this
[1:19:52] down and he says if you're a Christian
[1:19:55] if you're a Believer now not that you
[1:19:58] put your name on the book not that you
[1:20:00] shook a preacher's hand
[1:20:03] amen not that you just go to a message
[1:20:05] church but if you have died in Christ
[1:20:09] I'm not talking about you know so many
[1:20:11] times we point we want to point to so
[1:20:13] many things what what what was it you
[1:20:16] know that what what was the experience
[1:20:18] where I knew I was filled with the Holy
[1:20:20] Ghost and so many times we point to so
[1:20:21] well it was what maybe we want to point
[1:20:23] to experience
[1:20:25] es maybe a feeling a sensation that's
[1:20:27] all wonderful and God can do that in the
[1:20:29] book of Acts they were the Bible says
[1:20:31] that God confirmed them with signs and
[1:20:33] wonders but can I tell you just where my
[1:20:35] heart has been lately I think if we're
[1:20:37] going to point to any moment in time
[1:20:41] when when God changed our life we
[1:20:43] shouldn't look at some outward
[1:20:45] expression of emotion but we should be
[1:20:47] able to point down to an altar maybe not
[1:20:50] a physical one but a moment where you
[1:20:53] repented amen
[1:20:56] amen because you can have all the
[1:20:59] experiences in the world but if there's
[1:21:01] no repentance there's no
[1:21:07] change is that clear can I make that
[1:21:10] clear I'm not I'm not against
[1:21:12] experiences I'm not against people
[1:21:14] pointing to where they spoke in tongues
[1:21:16] that's wonderful I'm not pointing to you
[1:21:18] know to say anything against any
[1:21:20] sensation but I feel sometimes we've
[1:21:22] become like the Pentecostals who brother
[1:21:25] Ram says they were missing something and
[1:21:27] what were they missing they were missing
[1:21:29] an altar repentance where they died
[1:21:33] where they were changed where they lost
[1:21:35] their hatred they lost their malice they
[1:21:38] lost their jealousy they lost their eny
[1:21:41] amen come on
[1:21:43] somebody those things are important amen
[1:21:47] but if you're a Christian a real
[1:21:49] believer and you've been born again
[1:21:51] brother bam says when you breathe your
[1:21:52] last breath you go into that sixth
[1:21:56] Dimension and he says it's a
[1:21:59] paradise and and I was just hearing
[1:22:01] brother brandham just this morning and
[1:22:03] he says if you die and you're a Believer
[1:22:05] and you breathe your last breath you go
[1:22:07] into that sixth Dimension and he says
[1:22:09] it's a place of paradise where the dead
[1:22:11] in Christ go and he says and he says and
[1:22:15] you live in a Celestial body waiting for
[1:22:18] the day for the Lord to come and return
[1:22:21] in a Rapture yes amen and he said and
[1:22:24] and then you go back and pick up that
[1:22:27] mortal body you put in the ground Paul
[1:22:30] says it this way he says that when you a
[1:22:32] Believer dies he says when a Believer
[1:22:36] dies and you bury them you're literally
[1:22:40] burying a seed in the ground amen and he
[1:22:44] says and at the resurrection that seed
[1:22:47] that you buried will come up out of the
[1:22:50] ground oh friends I just am so glad that
[1:22:53] I can say I've been buried in
[1:22:55] Jesus amen I've been brought to newness
[1:22:58] of life and he says you go back he says
[1:23:01] you come back into a glorified body and
[1:23:04] you'll rule with Christ in the
[1:23:06] Millennium for a thousand years in a new
[1:23:08] Heaven and a new
[1:23:10] Earth brother bam says but if you're a
[1:23:13] sinner and you die and you say what was
[1:23:17] it brother Ram says if you never heeded
[1:23:20] the call not talking about whether
[1:23:22] you're on a bar stool this morning you
[1:23:23] could be sitting in a
[1:23:25] church and you never surrendered you say
[1:23:29] well I don't know really where it ever
[1:23:31] happened do I have it do I don't I don't
[1:23:33] I don't have an exact moment exact spot
[1:23:36] you know where I felt something that's
[1:23:38] okay you know where I I didn't feel any
[1:23:41] kind I didn't jump and run around the
[1:23:42] church that's okay but do you I want to
[1:23:45] ask you today do you have a
[1:23:47] moment where you know that your life
[1:23:51] changed
[1:23:53] amen where you repented of your sins as
[1:23:57] Peter says men and Brethren they said
[1:23:58] what shall we do
[1:24:01] repent that's the first step right
[1:24:06] amen
[1:24:08] repent I just feel the weight of this
[1:24:10] moment here as I just come to this part
[1:24:12] of my
[1:24:14] sermon because I think of how much with
[1:24:17] realities I have now of people who have
[1:24:19] lost what would I say to them now what
[1:24:23] could I have done what what words could
[1:24:26] I have
[1:24:29] spoken what what things could we say to
[1:24:32] so present Jesus in such a
[1:24:36] way to to present him and communicate
[1:24:39] him into such a way that would make a a
[1:24:42] sinner come under condemnation of their
[1:24:45] sins and want to serve him the rest of
[1:24:47] their
[1:24:50] life Prophet says if you die and you
[1:24:52] don't know the Lord you never received
[1:24:54] Jesus in your heart you never received
[1:24:58] him as your lord and
[1:25:00] savior then you go to a place when you
[1:25:02] breathe your last breath called The
[1:25:04] Fifth Dimension it's where the souls of
[1:25:06] the wicked are imprisoned awaiting the
[1:25:09] day of that great white Throne judgment
[1:25:12] to be judged according to the
[1:25:14] Deeds that were in your body done in
[1:25:17] your body brother Bram says oh I got it
[1:25:20] here and I'll read it The Fifth
[1:25:22] Dimension is where the sin of the
[1:25:23] unbeliever dies and goes to it's kind of
[1:25:26] well the horrible Dimension when a
[1:25:30] Christian dies he goes to the sixth and
[1:25:32] God is in the seventh you see when a
[1:25:34] Christian when he dies he goes under the
[1:25:36] altar of God right into the presence of
[1:25:39] God under the altar I love this and he's
[1:25:43] at
[1:25:46] rest to break it down when a man has a
[1:25:49] nightmare he's not altogether asleep
[1:25:50] neither is he awake he's between sleep
[1:25:53] and awake and that's what makes him have
[1:25:54] a horrible shaking and screaming because
[1:25:57] he's not asleep he's not awake and to
[1:25:59] take that shows where a man goes when he
[1:26:02] dies unconverted he's lived his time up
[1:26:06] he's dead on Earth and he can't go into
[1:26:09] the presence of God because he's not fit
[1:26:11] to go there without the
[1:26:14] blood and he's
[1:26:16] caught he's caught he's
[1:26:19] stuck he's in a
[1:26:22] nightmare he can't go into the presence
[1:26:25] of God to rest he can't come back to
[1:26:28] earth because his time's up he's in a
[1:26:31] nightmare and there he stays until the
[1:26:34] day of judgment a horrible thing to be
[1:26:37] and oh if I could just say this here
[1:26:39] today and let my voice ring out and and
[1:26:43] say that if you if you do anything in
[1:26:45] your life doesn't matter what education
[1:26:48] you get Release Yourself of your goals
[1:26:51] and worldly Ambitions just for a moment
[1:26:54] and understand that meeting Jesus is the
[1:26:58] most important thing that you can ever
[1:27:01] have in your
[1:27:03] life and nothing will mean anything
[1:27:06] there on that day other than do you have
[1:27:09] do you know
[1:27:12] him prophet of God says oh when I was a
[1:27:15] little boy he says I saw a vision of
[1:27:18] hell and brother Bron begins to talk
[1:27:20] about it how that he was shot and he
[1:27:22] doesn't tell it many places but
[1:27:24] he says I think it's in present stage
[1:27:26] and he says I he says I was there I was
[1:27:28] shot laying in a
[1:27:29] field and he says he says I seen that
[1:27:32] vision of hell and you remember he talks
[1:27:34] about those those women that were there
[1:27:36] and and and and he says painted like a
[1:27:39] wolf just paint all over their face what
[1:27:42] brother bam says you remember years
[1:27:45] later I think it was just maybe just not
[1:27:47] very long after that you know he has
[1:27:50] this Vision but but after he tells the
[1:27:51] story just later he's at in two on it I
[1:27:54] think it's JC Pennies and he sees those
[1:27:56] women coming down the escalator speaking
[1:27:58] Spanish and brother bam says and that
[1:28:01] Vision broke again and I could see them
[1:28:03] that makeup that was on their
[1:28:06] eyes you see you reflect
[1:28:09] something you reflect one place or the
[1:28:13] other
[1:28:15] place your life is just a reflection
[1:28:18] where you live here will determine where
[1:28:21] you will live there it's only a
[1:28:25] representation do you live in heaven
[1:28:28] here or do you live in hell
[1:28:31] here brother Adam says I've never told
[1:28:33] this before he says I was laying there
[1:28:35] shot dying in a field and and he says
[1:28:37] the only ple I could say to God is a
[1:28:39] little boy was Lord I've never committed
[1:28:41] adultery that's what brother bandam says
[1:28:42] he says a little boy even 15 years old
[1:28:45] he said I you know I tried everything I
[1:28:47] could to live right he says I couldn't
[1:28:49] hardly get a word out of my mouth blood
[1:28:52] you know just gushing he says Lord I H
[1:28:54] I've tried everything I can do to live
[1:28:56] right and brother bam says and he says I
[1:28:59] was I was laying there dying in a
[1:29:01] hospital I always knew there was a God
[1:29:04] and he says I remember that first prayer
[1:29:06] that I ever tried to pray the only thing
[1:29:08] I could say he says the only thing he
[1:29:10] said I could say was Lord I've just
[1:29:12] tried to serve you the best I've tried
[1:29:13] to live clean the best that I could and
[1:29:16] he says then laying there the do doctor
[1:29:19] walked away from the room and he says
[1:29:21] and then I fell into it and he saids say
[1:29:24] I started sinking below the bed and he
[1:29:26] says and I sank and I begin to fall and
[1:29:29] he says as I fell he says I could just
[1:29:31] he says I could just he says it would
[1:29:33] just looked like so dark all around me
[1:29:35] just darkness everywhere and he says I
[1:29:38] began to holler for Papa but there was
[1:29:41] no papa there I begin to holler for Mama
[1:29:44] and he says but there was no mama there
[1:29:47] and brother B there was no mama there to
[1:29:49] pray for me no mama there to help me
[1:29:51] there was no God there amen to talk
[1:29:55] to brother bam says oh I it was just he
[1:29:59] he says it was just endless just falling
[1:30:02] and falling and falling and a nightmare
[1:30:04] burning blazing hell and the prophet
[1:30:08] says falling I thought oh my over and
[1:30:10] over like this I he says I got into a
[1:30:13] place somewhere there was smoke and and
[1:30:15] he says there was fire and it was dark
[1:30:17] and there was just sickness all
[1:30:21] around oh he says such a fing it was you
[1:30:25] never imagine this but brother bam says
[1:30:29] this is what death felt like feels like
[1:30:32] for an
[1:30:34] unbeliever and he says I he says I could
[1:30:36] just see those women coming running up
[1:30:40] to
[1:30:41] me isn't it amazing that both hell and
[1:30:44] heaven there's women running up to
[1:30:48] him but these women are not the women in
[1:30:50] white gowns with long flowing hair
[1:30:52] saying our precious brother
[1:30:54] brother bam says these women had makeup
[1:30:56] mascara just all painted all over their
[1:31:00] faces and he says he says I could see
[1:31:03] them pain on their eyes remember that's
[1:31:05] been 45 years about 40 years ago anyhow
[1:31:08] going they was going
[1:31:11] ooh
[1:31:13] ooh and brother brandham says I stopped
[1:31:16] and I said am I to be here
[1:31:19] forever forever I said oh God if you'll
[1:31:23] let me me out of this place if you'll
[1:31:26] deliver me from this place I'll serve
[1:31:29] you my whole
[1:31:30] life he says I'll never be ashamed of
[1:31:33] you again
[1:31:35] Lord he says the first thing you know I
[1:31:37] felt myself coming back up starting to
[1:31:40] raise back up and he says the doctor was
[1:31:43] alarmed cuz my heart was beaten 17 times
[1:31:46] a minute I'd unbled on my blood out and
[1:31:48] everything I was laying in my old Blood
[1:31:50] Brother bam de begins to tell Al he goes
[1:31:52] to JC Pennies and he sees them speaking
[1:31:54] and he says brother sister let me tell
[1:31:56] you something it may seem funny now but
[1:31:58] once you get there it's a serious thing
[1:32:01] don't you ever go that way amen amen me
[1:32:07] as an old man a minister I preached
[1:32:09] around the world got millions of friends
[1:32:11] get away from the things of the world
[1:32:13] and if there's something in you and you
[1:32:15] still want to act like the world and do
[1:32:18] the things of the world remember you're
[1:32:20] none of gods you might be a church
[1:32:22] member right
[1:32:24] but until that deep calls to a deep and
[1:32:28] you
[1:32:31] respond brother bam talks about Lazarus
[1:32:34] I'm just taking here just a couple
[1:32:35] minutes talks about Lazarus and and how
[1:32:38] that the rich man in Lazarus and there's
[1:32:40] a goal fixed between us and brother B
[1:32:43] says I know people claim they pray you
[1:32:44] out of those places but don't you never
[1:32:46] believe it that's contrary to the word
[1:32:47] of God the way the tree tree leans is
[1:32:51] the way it falls Jesus said there was a
[1:32:53] gulf when when a man died went to hell
[1:32:54] he could not never come to Heaven no man
[1:32:57] ever crossed it and never would that
[1:32:58] settles it as far as I'm concerned when
[1:33:00] Jesus said that was it that's all of it
[1:33:03] so just remember now somebody say
[1:33:07] now now is your chance amen and it may
[1:33:13] be your last
[1:33:14] opportunity you say to me preacher is
[1:33:17] there remembrance of hell do you
[1:33:18] remember things oh yeah oh yeah Jesus
[1:33:21] said that there was he said talks about
[1:33:24] Lazarus the rich man and he says that
[1:33:26] you know Abraham he he says the rich man
[1:33:29] lifted up his eyes and in hell he saw
[1:33:31] Abraham and Lazarus in his bosom and
[1:33:33] said remember in your lifetime so
[1:33:35] there's Remembrance in heaven in hell as
[1:33:38] as how the law he says what an awful
[1:33:40] thing it would be to know that the great
[1:33:42] meetings that they had sat in and heard
[1:33:45] the mighty sermons of the anointed
[1:33:48] Ministers of God do we I stopped when I
[1:33:52] read this I said Lord
[1:33:54] are we cognizant of how many
[1:33:58] times Grace knocks on our
[1:34:04] door are we aware of how many times
[1:34:09] Grace just keeps reaching
[1:34:12] out trying everything to pull you
[1:34:16] in and while Heaven's pulling hell's
[1:34:20] pulling and brother bam says oh he says
[1:34:23] don't you ever think of how many times
[1:34:25] how many sermons they've heard how many
[1:34:27] anointed meetings they've been in to see
[1:34:29] the Wonders God's performed amongst his
[1:34:32] people and then remember all of those
[1:34:34] things and still somehow be lost it
[1:34:38] would haunt them
[1:34:41] forever brother Brandon begins to talk
[1:34:43] about this and he says and in this
[1:34:45] Vision I believe I was caught to that
[1:34:48] sixth Dimension looking back down here I
[1:34:52] could see back see sight isn't exactly
[1:34:54] with the eyes that's Earthly but sight
[1:34:57] is a greater thing the sight that they
[1:34:59] have there their contact is far beyond
[1:35:01] any contact that our natural senses
[1:35:03] would
[1:35:06] contact so notice as brother Brandon
[1:35:08] begins to describe this
[1:35:10] place and then brother bam has a vision
[1:35:14] I know we've talked about it here before
[1:35:15] I'm just going to close on
[1:35:18] this he talks it's not a vision he
[1:35:20] actually talks to a a girl
[1:35:24] and he and he's in a he's in a trying to
[1:35:28] think of the city there in
[1:35:30] Ohio and and brother benham's there at
[1:35:32] the insane
[1:35:35] asylum and and and he says and I'm there
[1:35:37] he says and oh man people just out of
[1:35:40] their minds he talks about you know one
[1:35:42] guy over the over against the wall just
[1:35:45] banging his head against a concrete wall
[1:35:46] and blood coming out some of them in
[1:35:49] straight jackets and he says and and he
[1:35:52] says they were just a haunted house just
[1:35:54] I sounds so
[1:35:55] haunted and he says oh I just began to
[1:35:58] get overwhelmed me a preacher a prayer
[1:36:00] of the sick and I'm there to pray for
[1:36:02] people and he says and I stopped and I
[1:36:05] said Lord where do I even
[1:36:08] start and brother Ram says a little girl
[1:36:12] said sir I wish you would start with
[1:36:15] me and brother bandam says you little
[1:36:19] woman and he says you surely you're not
[1:36:22] a patient here
[1:36:24] she says oh brother brandom I I am I
[1:36:28] wish you'd hear my story for a moment I
[1:36:31] thought I thought about that story so
[1:36:32] many times he preaches that message from
[1:36:34] that time and I thought to myself did
[1:36:36] she ever
[1:36:38] imagine did she ever as a little girl
[1:36:42] did she ever imagine while she sat in
[1:36:44] church maybe in Sunday school and her
[1:36:46] mother telling her about the things of
[1:36:48] God did she ever imagine when she was
[1:36:51] playing with dolls imagine and picturing
[1:36:54] her life how she would be married and
[1:36:56] have children and live in a home could
[1:36:58] she have ever imagined that her life
[1:37:01] would end and be in an insane
[1:37:03] asylum out of her mind alcoholic a
[1:37:08] prostitute had solded herself on the
[1:37:10] street did she ever imagine she would be
[1:37:12] there i' thought about that so many
[1:37:14] times sitting at that stoplight and
[1:37:16] there's a man on the side of the
[1:37:19] stoplight and he's holding a sign a
[1:37:21] beard you know down and scraggly and a
[1:37:23] disheveled look and I just have so many
[1:37:26] times looked into the eyes of that
[1:37:28] person and I thought where was you when
[1:37:31] you was when you was just a little boy
[1:37:33] amen amen you know many of them never
[1:37:37] would want to end up where they're at
[1:37:40] amen but the cruelty of sin got a hold
[1:37:44] of their life sold them a pize and they
[1:37:48] believed it
[1:37:50] right used messengers of Satan called
[1:37:54] friends
[1:37:55] amen amen and you thought they were
[1:37:58] friends and they
[1:38:00] weren't and every time you fed on that

[1:38:06] their company listen friends it doesn't
[1:38:07] have to be a physical friend it could be
[1:38:08] a video game it could be a website it
[1:38:11] could be an app that you download I
[1:38:13] don't care what it is there's some
[1:38:14] Spirit that's constantly trying to feed
[1:38:17] you and fil and and and influence you in
[1:38:19] some way to believe that lie amen
[1:38:25] I never would even imagine he thinks to
[1:38:27] himself I never would even imagine I'd
[1:38:29] be here addicted to some drug begging on
[1:38:32] the side of the
[1:38:34] street but I just stopped for a moment
[1:38:37] and thought God no man no man would not
[1:38:40] have an opportunity of
[1:38:42] mercy no human no life no man no woman
[1:38:47] somewhere in their life somewhere God's
[1:38:52] grace reached out to grab them amen and
[1:38:55] maybe they never turned it down or said
[1:38:57] I don't want nothing to do with it or ah
[1:38:59] maybe another time may they I'm not
[1:39:01] saying that they rejected it but the
[1:39:03] prophet of God said you being apathetic
[1:39:06] to it or just well you know maybe not

[1:58:54] what are you doing everything in my life
[1:58:57] the way I live my convictions that I
[1:58:59] hold the standards that I hold are for
[1:59:01] one reason I'm laying up my treasures
[1:59:04] not in this Earth but I'm laying them up
[1:59:07] in heaven amen prophet of God says and
[1:59:11] many he says oh there will be that light
[1:59:13] it begins to spread you imagine it on
[1:59:15] that
[1:59:17] day as light begins to spread and

[1:59:22] love this we'll know as we are known
[1:59:25] we'll
[1:59:29] understand how many want to have
[1:59:31] that how many want to say Lord I'll lay
[1:59:34] aside everything in this life as brother
[1:59:36] Adams told how many will do it as
[1:59:38] brother Adam's told lay aside everything
[1:59:40] until you get perfect love then let me
[1:59:42] do it God prophet of God comes to that
[1:59:45] other dimension and says whatever you do
[1:59:47] lay aside anything but don't miss this
[1:59:50] don't miss this moment
[1:59:53] when all Darkness flees and all trouble
[1:59:55] flees and no more hospitals and no more
[1:59:58] funerals and no more sorrow and no more
[2:00:00] trouble oh it's a wonderful place oh but
[2:00:03] can I read you this favorite part of
[2:00:05] this quote brother bam says and many
[2:00:08] there'll be many there that day when we
[2:00:10] look around that we didn't even think
[2:00:14] would be there amen for you know it's at
[2:00:19] that time that I believe that the bread
[2:00:22] that we have cast upon the human
[2:00:25] Troubled Waters will return to us on
[2:00:28] that day when we see the effects of Our
[2:00:32] Testimony on people that we didn't
[2:00:35] understand their actions towards it
[2:00:37] they'll probably be there what a day to
[2:00:40] see the seeds that we have SED not even
[2:00:45] thinking that they would do but here
[2:00:47] they
[2:00:49] are would you close your eyes and raise
[2:00:51] your hands with with me here today every
[2:00:52] head bowed and say
[2:00:55] God I'm going to sew my
[2:00:58] seed I heard a vision I Heard a Voice
[2:01:01] from Heaven I've caught a vision of
[2:01:03] Heaven this morning Lord I've caught a
[2:01:05] vision of how important that place is
[2:01:07] how special that place is it's not that
[2:01:09] I don't want to go to hell it wasn't
[2:01:11] hell it was that there was no God there
[2:01:14] so God today I'm casting my bread upon
[2:01:17] the human Troubled Waters might be
[2:01:20] children might be an uncle might be an
[2:01:21] aunt might be a dad a mother a father
[2:01:24] and say God I am laying up my treasures
[2:01:28] in heaven where moths and rusts don't
[2:01:31] corrupt where thieves don't break in
[2:01:34] nothing could ever take them from me
[2:01:36] that day prophet of God has given a
[2:01:38] voice there at that end of
[2:01:43] that he says
[2:01:45] I he says I begin to move from that
[2:01:49] joyful every head bowed now every eye
[2:01:50] closed
[2:01:53] as I began to move from that beautiful
[2:01:55] joyful place as far as my eyes could see
[2:01:57] people were coming towards me to embrace
[2:01:59] me suddenly I was back on the bed again
[2:02:02] I said oh God and I wonder if maybe
[2:02:05] you'd pray this I'm going to give you an
[2:02:06] opportunity to identify and lift the
[2:02:08] hand and say Lord that's my prayer maybe
[2:02:10] you'd pray with the prophet and say oh
[2:02:12] God help
[2:02:14] [Music]

[2:02:20] let me stay straight on the word I don't
[2:02:24] care what anyone else does

[2:02:32] joyful place I am more convinced than
[2:02:35] ever in my life that it will take
[2:02:36] perfect love to enter that place there
