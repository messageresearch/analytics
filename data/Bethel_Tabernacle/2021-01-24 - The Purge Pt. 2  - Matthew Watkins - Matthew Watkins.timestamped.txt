[0:03] [Music]
[0:15] you
[0:22] [Music]
[0:43] [Music]
[0:50] [Music]
[0:56] so
[1:07] [Music]
[1:10] um
[1:19] [Music]
[1:21] let's also enter our feet this morning
[1:24] first corinthians chapter 15 if you have
[1:26] your bible we're going to turn there
[1:27] first corinthians chapter 15. amen
[1:30] praise the lord
[1:31] i just want to continue on from where we
[1:33] were
[1:35] a couple sundays ago we spoke on
[1:38] the purge and so we'd like to take this
[1:41] in part two
[1:42] i believe it's a a lengthy subject and
[1:45] so we covered a lot of it
[1:47] last time i'm going to do a just a
[1:49] little bit of refresh
[1:51] on that and then we'll read some quotes
[1:53] some quotations here
[1:55] we'd like to discontinue this first
[1:56] corinthians chapter 15
[1:58] and i want to begin at verse 12. now if
[2:01] christ be preached that he rose from the
[2:04] dead
[2:04] how say some among you that there is no
[2:06] resurrection of the dead
[2:08] but if there be no resurrection of the
[2:10] dead then is christ not risen
[2:13] and if christ be not risen then our
[2:15] preaching
[2:16] is in vain and your faith also vain
[2:20] yea and we are found false witnesses of
[2:22] god because we have testified of god
[2:25] that he raised up christ whom he raised
[2:27] not up
[2:29] if so be that the dead rise not
[2:32] for if the dead rise not then is not
[2:35] christ
[2:36] raised and if christ be not raised
[2:39] your faith is vain ye are yet
[2:42] in your sins see how important the
[2:44] resurrection is
[2:46] then they also which are fallen asleep
[2:48] in christ are perished if in this life
[2:50] only we have hope in christ
[2:53] we are of all men most
[2:56] miserable notice he's not saying that if
[2:59] in this life only we had hope
[3:01] but he's actually saying that even if
[3:02] you believe in jesus
[3:04] in this life yet you don't believe
[3:07] in the next life you're still most
[3:10] miserable
[3:11] you follow that even if you're a
[3:13] believer but you don't believe in the
[3:15] resurrection that there's something
[3:16] after this
[3:17] he said i'm of all men most miserable
[3:20] and he says he says here verse 20
[3:24] but now is christ risen from the dead
[3:26] and become the first fruits of them that
[3:28] slept
[3:29] for since by man came death by man also
[3:32] came the resurrection of the dead
[3:33] foreign
[3:34] for as in adam all die even so in christ
[3:37] shall all be made alive
[3:39] but every man and his order christ the
[3:41] firstfruits afterwards they that are
[3:43] christ at his coming
[3:45] then cometh the end when he shall have
[3:48] delivered up the kingdom to god even the
[3:50] father
[3:51] when he shall have put down all rule and
[3:54] all authority
[3:55] and power for he must reign till he hath
[3:58] put all
[3:58] enemies under his feet
[4:02] you can be seated this morning
[4:05] he must reign verse 25 till he hath put
[4:08] all
[4:09] enemies under his feet
[4:12] so we know that some of those enemies
[4:14] will be put under the feet
[4:16] of christ where he's reigning and where
[4:20] is he reigning at right now
[4:21] in the heart of his children and so he
[4:24] says here he says the last enemy verse
[4:26] 26
[4:27] that shall be destroyed is death
[4:30] for he hath put all things under his
[4:32] feet but when he said all things are put
[4:33] under him it is manifest that he is
[4:35] accept he is accepted
[4:37] which should put all things under him
[4:39] and when all things shall be subdued
[4:41] unto him then shall the son of man
[4:43] also himself be subject unto him that
[4:45] put all things under him that god may be
[4:47] all in all
[4:49] he goes on all the way through this
[4:52] entire topic
[4:53] of the importance that we believe
[4:56] that something happened after the cross
[5:00] you see in the western culture in the
[5:01] eastern culture is
[5:03] is completely different if you travel
[5:05] east
[5:06] and you you here we are in the western
[5:08] world the focus
[5:10] uh is the cross that's why even in our
[5:12] protestant churches even our church we
[5:14] have a cross
[5:15] because culture or western culture has
[5:18] focused the catholic church has focused
[5:20] on the cross
[5:21] you go into churches today it's you'll
[5:23] see a crucified savior
[5:25] see a crucified jesus it's amazing if
[5:27] you go to the orthodox church in the
[5:29] east you won't see the cross
[5:30] you'll see a resurrected jesus with his
[5:33] arms reached out
[5:34] in the orthodox church and it's because
[5:37] they focus
[5:38] on something completely different and
[5:40] you know for me
[5:41] the the core and focus of my experience
[5:44] with the lord is not the cross
[5:46] it's the resurrection i'm i'm thankful
[5:50] for the cross but we just
[5:52] read if it wasn't for the resurrection
[5:54] that cross
[5:55] meant nothing right so he says that i
[5:58] want to key in on this word
[6:00] not to get sidetracked here but he says
[6:03] then shall the end let's read that again
[6:05] here
[6:06] verse 24 then cometh the end
[6:10] when he shall have delivered up the
[6:11] kingdom to god so we know as we spoke
[6:14] last a couple sundays ago on this the
[6:17] and we wanted this dive right back into
[6:19] the teachings of this
[6:20] that there were specific scriptures that
[6:23] speak of
[6:24] the the tribulation period very specific
[6:27] to them and a lot of things that brother
[6:29] branham says here
[6:31] about concerning that we're going to
[6:33] follow just a timeline and i don't have
[6:35] time to share this entire document but
[6:37] we'll cover some of it
[6:39] here today but we spent a lot of time uh
[6:42] showing you that the prophet of god
[6:46] had a bible view he had a church view
[6:48] sorry
[6:49] of the bible even his own bible that he
[6:52] studied and preached from
[6:53] was influenced by a baptist church
[6:57] so after the seals brother martin makes
[6:59] a comment and he says
[7:00] the bible became a brand new book
[7:03] and so he looked at everything
[7:04] differently so that's just a simple way
[7:07] to say that we don't
[7:09] toss out everything before pre-63 by no
[7:11] means
[7:12] but we understand it in the light in
[7:14] which he understood
[7:16] it and the way that the the the
[7:18] revelation of god was progressively
[7:20] given to him it's
[7:21] in it's it's unique we brother branham's
[7:24] ministry typed the ministry of the
[7:25] apostle paul the alpha messenger
[7:27] and he said that last ladies and
[7:29] church-age messenger would be just like
[7:31] paul
[7:32] you know but the difference we have to
[7:33] always keep in mind
[7:35] is that when we study the message it's
[7:36] very different than going back to study
[7:38] the letters from paul
[7:41] in that the letters of paul are the
[7:43] letters that are in the canon of
[7:44] scripture
[7:45] that were translated and chosen to be
[7:48] put in with brother branham
[7:49] we don't just have the pertinent letters
[7:51] that were spoken but we have recorded
[7:53] tapes of
[7:54] everything he said from 47 to 65.
[7:57] you don't have that with paul we don't
[7:59] have every word paul ever spoke or
[8:02] wrote recorded we don't have that
[8:05] we have what god wanted us to have and
[8:08] this is the
[8:09] the word is the revelation of himself
[8:12] but with the prophet of god we have
[8:14] in a recorded sermon for every story
[8:16] every hiccup every uh
[8:18] uh uh i i we have every everything the
[8:20] the entire length of it so
[8:22] god intended us not just to be parrots
[8:25] just
[8:26] say what he said and repeat and repeat
[8:27] and repeat but by god's spirit we
[8:30] discern
[8:31] the under and we get the understanding
[8:32] of the word by discernment by
[8:34] having the holy spirit which is the
[8:37] teacher
[8:39] so without the teacher you'll never
[8:40] understand the message
[8:42] you'll get a lot of stories and books
[8:43] and and and a lot of
[8:45] a lot of doctrines but you won't have
[8:47] the teacher who
[8:49] uh who gives you the revelation
[8:52] so brother the prophet of god says a lot
[8:55] of things prior to when we said this
[8:57] last
[8:58] with the two sundays ago the prophet of
[9:00] god something happens
[9:02] in the revelation of the seven seals
[9:06] at about 12 o'clock one o'clock in the
[9:08] afternoon
[9:09] brother branham says i was just writing
[9:11] on the first seal he said i was just
[9:12] writing down just to say it he had taken
[9:15] from larkin he admits that he taken from
[9:17] these writers over here and he had
[9:18] all of these now remember remember this
[9:20] is an important point
[9:22] brother adam says the bible became a new
[9:24] book and he had a church view a lot of a
[9:26] lot of things he he believed the white
[9:28] horse writer in the book of revelations
[9:29] was jesus christ
[9:31] now we don't get up here brother branham
[9:33] did say that
[9:35] but in the seals he corrects that he
[9:36] said i was just about to write it
[9:38] he said at about 1 pm the angel of the
[9:40] lord came into the room
[9:42] and corrected that amen and he says
[9:45] that's not the
[9:46] christ he says that's the antichrist
[9:50] complete reversal now say what he said
[9:53] do we get up behind our pulpits and
[9:54] preach that the white horse rider is
[9:56] christ
[9:57] even though brother madam said that no
[9:58] we take the progressive revelation of
[10:00] the way it was revealed to him
[10:02] and we preached the truth so something
[10:05] happened
[10:06] in the room at 1 pm before 12 o'clock i
[10:09] think he says early in the afternoon
[10:11] prior to preaching the seals he said i
[10:13] just written it down to say it and he
[10:14] said the holy spirit came and changed it
[10:17] so we accept that something happened
[10:20] that changed
[10:21] everything brother branham had seen
[10:23] about revelations before
[10:24] prior to that it changed everything
[10:28] now it wasn't that everything was wrong
[10:32] i remember this it wasn't that
[10:34] everything was
[10:35] always the church view we make that like
[10:37] a dirty thing listen the church had a
[10:39] lot of it right
[10:42] because truth was always truth but it
[10:45] had it had he wrote it and he wrote it
[10:47] and he wrote it and he wrote it but
[10:48] there were there was traces there was a
[10:50] lot of things
[10:50] even a lot of things that we hold to be
[10:52] true today
[10:54] are mirrored with the nominal church not
[10:56] everything
[10:57] that we believe is different
[11:00] i love how brother richie said that last
[11:02] night this is clarity
[11:04] it is a focusing uh i love my
[11:07] my father-in-law as a hunter and he did
[11:09] a lot of hunting out west he said i look
[11:11] he said you he i remember one day i was
[11:13] sitting with him and he said
[11:14] you see those deer over there on the
[11:15] side of the mountain here we were on
[11:17] over in
[11:18] you know in arizona there's no trees
[11:19] you're just on mountains and you've got
[11:21] you know big hills and he's had a he had
[11:24] a tripod with a big pair of schwarzkies
[11:26] binoculars and he's just sitting there
[11:28] glassing
[11:30] and i i didn't have a i had my
[11:32] binoculars but i hadn't had him set up
[11:34] he said oh dear there's a deer right
[11:35] there
[11:36] three three bucks right there on the on
[11:38] the the hill there
[11:39] about 400 500 yards away and i looked
[11:41] and i said where he said right by that
[11:43] yucca plant near that
[11:44] little mesquite tree you see it going up
[11:47] right there i said
[11:49] i don't see it he said yeah i said
[11:51] they're there i said are you sure he
[11:52] said yeah
[11:53] get your binoculars out so sure enough i
[11:55] get my binoculars and now
[11:57] through the binoculars i'm looking at
[11:59] the same mountain
[12:01] it's not any different mountain it's not
[12:02] another hill over i'm looking at the
[12:04] same mountain but now
[12:05] i have eyes now i have binoculars and
[12:08] i'm looking at the same exact thing
[12:11] but i spot something i had never seen
[12:13] before
[12:14] because of prophetic vision so what was
[12:16] the message it wasn't we got to be so
[12:18] careful how we get lay our foundation
[12:21] it wasn't a new teaching a new doctrine
[12:23] that it's not the message of william
[12:24] branham as we said that last time
[12:26] it's the message of jesus christ given
[12:28] unto a prophet
[12:30] to speak so brother and says so many
[12:33] things we're going to use all of our
[12:34] time for that so let's go to the squeeze
[12:36] document brother um
[12:38] brother uh josh i sent it i emailed it a
[12:40] pdf'd it you said you had it
[12:44] do you have it or not i just want you to
[12:46] open the document and zoom in on it and
[12:48] scroll with me you don't need to put it
[12:49] in the pro presenter
[12:51] so brother branham says many things
[12:53] about the squeeze here
[12:55] i made this document back in march of
[12:57] last year if you want it you can have it
[12:59] i made it as a help
[13:01] a guide to study some of the things
[13:03] because so much especially good just
[13:05] make it full screen
[13:06] command plus we'll zoom that in then you
[13:08] can scroll
[13:09] to make it large um you and so
[13:13] i made this don't look that way for a
[13:14] minute while they're getting that ready
[13:16] to scroll
[13:16] to the top because so many things had
[13:19] came out
[13:20] so many things especially when
[13:21] coronavirus had started
[13:23] it really caused a lot of believers to
[13:26] go in and begin to read some things and
[13:28] look at things that brother branham
[13:30] said and i heard this and you ever you
[13:32] ever said that before didn't brother
[13:33] branham say this
[13:34] didn't brother matt didn't he say this
[13:36] over you heard brother branham and you
[13:37] don't really know you just know he said
[13:39] something and
[13:40] you know we said this two sundays ago a
[13:41] lot of times you trace that back and
[13:43] it's
[13:43] based on something he said but then you
[13:45] had this preacher and this teacher and
[13:47] this brother
[13:48] they said this and by the time you get
[13:49] it all out it's
[13:51] not necessarily exactly what he said and
[13:53] it can cause a misunderstanding
[13:55] so it's important to go back to actually
[13:57] what it said and so
[13:59] the pandemic if it did anything at all
[14:01] for the believers for the bride
[14:03] it's to me it's a lot it's a lot like
[14:06] daniel
[14:07] who the bible says that
[14:10] he said i understood by books
[14:14] that the captivity you remember that the
[14:16] daniel understood by books and he starts
[14:18] realizing hey there's something written
[14:20] about
[14:20] here we're not going to be in babylon
[14:22] forever
[14:24] so it was babylonian captivity
[14:27] oppression upon god's people
[14:29] that cause daniel to start opening the
[14:30] books up and going wait a minute what
[14:32] did god say about this
[14:34] so very much the same this pandemic has
[14:37] caused believers to go
[14:38] let's see what the prophet of god said
[14:40] about it
[14:42] what you're going to find is that you
[14:43] have some teachings that are that
[14:45] that go around out of based upon good
[14:47] sincere godly people even myself
[14:50] even us all can admit we've we've said
[14:52] or believed many things that lord
[14:54] corrected us and showed us later and
[14:55] said okay i didn't have that exactly
[14:57] right
[14:58] and so he says here i i i say i guess i
[15:02] wrote this here
[15:04] uh the following is a compilation of
[15:06] various quotes categorized by topic
[15:08] and placed in chronological order of the
[15:11] year for the
[15:12] subject surrounding the teaching of a
[15:14] pre-tribulation
[15:15] physical persecution of the bride before
[15:18] the rapture
[15:19] and or things that must happen before
[15:21] the rapture can take place
[15:24] much time of exhaustive searching has
[15:26] yielded what you will read below
[15:28] but i am certain that it is not complete
[15:30] and more could be added to the topic
[15:32] not specific i'm not seeing that too
[15:34] well uh no specific thoughts are
[15:36] expressed here an
[15:38] emphasis by bolden underline are only
[15:40] added to highlight the point as it
[15:41] relates to the presupposition
[15:43] again this is not a list of quotes on
[15:45] persecution nor are any quotes added for
[15:48] a rebuttal or balance
[15:49] rather this is a list of quotes that
[15:51] have been used to support the teaching
[15:53] of a pre-tribulation physical
[15:55] persecution of the bride before the
[15:57] rapture
[15:58] and or things that must happen before
[16:00] the rapture can take place
[16:02] so let's go through some of these then
[16:04] we'll pause and i'm not going to get to
[16:05] the whole document
[16:06] this is 1963 very famous one here that's
[16:09] used a lot
[16:11] but it will not be used in a great way
[16:14] until this council begins to tighten up
[16:16] when it does the pentecostals and so
[16:19] forth can almost impersonate anything
[16:21] can be done
[16:22] but when that time comes when the
[16:23] squeeze there's that word
[16:25] when the squeeze comes down then you'll
[16:28] see what you've seen temporarily be
[16:30] manifested in the fullness of its power
[16:32] see
[16:33] see see it's tightening and when that
[16:36] time comes and the press
[16:37] comes to a place to where you're pressed
[16:39] out then watch what i'm fixing to tell
[16:41] you
[16:42] in a few minutes watch the third pull
[16:44] then see it'll
[16:45] absolutely to the totally lost but it
[16:47] will be for the bride and for the church
[16:50] so brother madam speaks i got this red
[16:52] highlighted here as to the topic
[16:54] the persecution coming 56 this is 1956.
[16:58] first thing you'll know they'll try to
[17:00] stop
[17:00] all of this try to quit praying for the
[17:03] sick and put a band on it
[17:04] just remember that when persecution
[17:07] rises the church
[17:08] it comes to its very heights then it's
[17:11] always the best yes sir god is working
[17:13] it all together
[17:14] 1958 why we are not a denomination
[17:17] what's
[17:18] not sure what's going on there guys i
[17:20] want to make sure
[17:21] they follow this here yeah there you go
[17:25] scroll down down down
[17:29] oh boy
[17:34] i'm in 1958.
[17:38] i just read 1956 there
[17:41] go up to the very top go up to the very
[17:43] top we're going to get it don't worry
[17:45] y'all all right this morning get it back

[17:56] all right so close it out restart
[17:59] when in doubt crash it out
[18:03] there you go i'm just going to keep
[18:06] reading they'll catch up
[18:08] so why are we nomina not a denomination
[18:10] but then after
[18:11] he had two little horns civil and
[18:13] ecclesiastical powers then he received
[18:15] power spoke like a dragon the dragon did
[18:16] before him
[18:18] so you just got to mark it down we are
[18:19] coming into a religious persecution with
[18:22] the same things that they did in pagan
[18:24] rome
[18:24] many years ago now notice how he says
[18:27] this for it's thus saith the lord that's

[18:46] first thus saith the lord a persecution
[18:48] coming
[18:50] next one 1961 scroll down and he says
[18:53] now you see why my voice is going to be
[18:56] stopped pretty soon
[18:58] but somebody's going to know yes why
[19:00] revelations 2 20 she called herself a
[19:01] prophetess you just watched the wave of
[19:03] sin happen now
[19:04] you watch core go plum to the core you
[19:07] watch
[19:08] modernistic watch ungodly things happen
[19:10] in the churches
[19:11] and finally there will come a
[19:13] persecution the bible says so thus
[19:15] saith the lord jezebel religion in 1961.
[19:18] now go to this i predict i think it's
[19:21] over i think it's you're going to have
[19:22] to go over the way you had it scroll up
[19:24] right there i predict that the two
[19:27] denominational groups pentecostal and
[19:29] evangelical groups
[19:31] will work together in a denomination
[19:33] we'll unite themselves together
[19:35] and we'll become a member all of them of
[19:37] the federation of the council churches
[19:39] or the council of churches
[19:40] they already belong to it all of them
[19:42] there will come through them a forcing
[19:43] or a
[19:44] boycott that will stop everything but
[19:47] what belongs to that union of churches
[19:49] the bible said that there would be a
[19:51] boycott even to such a way it would
[19:53] cause people to not
[19:55] buy or sell unless they had received
[19:56] this the mark of the beast
[19:58] which is romanism and the image of the
[20:00] beast which is protestant
[20:02] protestantism that the image the beast
[20:04] had power authority to give
[20:06] the image life to speak and and it did
[20:09] and that's the confederation of churches
[20:11] when they confederate themselves
[20:12] together now there's many young people
[20:14] here i don't know jesus
[20:15] may come this afternoon he may come next
[20:18] year i don't know
[20:19] when he'll be coming but remember if i
[20:21] do not live to see that day of his
[20:22] coming which i hope that i will
[20:24] and somehow believe i will now if i do
[20:28] not
[20:28] see it do not let this word ever depart
[20:30] from your ears in your heart
[20:33] just remember i speak in the name of the
[20:35] lord now i believe with all my heart
[20:38] that's the way it'll wind up there will
[20:40] be like a union a boycott all such
[20:42] places as this here will be closed down
[20:45] and you'll not be able to speak unless
[20:47] you got a permission or license from
[20:49] this federation
[20:50] of churches to hold a service it's
[20:52] almost it shows it does
[20:53] it shows it does that now even in the
[20:56] denomination it shows where it's at yes
[20:58] sir
[20:58] you have to have it that's where it'll
[21:00] wind up that's my prediction as a
[21:02] servant of christ through the
[21:03] understanding that i have over the word
[21:05] and the inspiration that's where it'll
[21:08] come all
[21:08] signs are pointing to the end
[21:12] you're following the thought here what
[21:14] brother and i'm seeing what he's saying
[21:16] when the persecution comes don't get
[21:19] scared
[21:20] there's a light said he would catch his
[21:22] people away shall not go through the
[21:24] tribulation she'll never do it he said
[21:25] she wouldn't she'll be called away
[21:28] how they gonna do it brother and it
[21:29] looks awful dark no matter how dark it
[21:31] gets you can't see your hand before you
[21:33] just remember there's a man
[21:34] here that can turn on the light he'll
[21:37] rapture the church
[21:41] christ is the mystery i'm just gonna
[21:42] read a couple more and we'll stop with
[21:44] this document
[21:45] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[21:46] and they're going to bring a persecution
[21:50] uh that's not it maybe oh maybe down to
[21:53] the next page
[21:53] i'm guessing i'm sorry guys it's not
[21:56] it's not the brother's fault back there
[21:57] it's how i sent it to him so
[22:01] he says they're going to bring a
[22:03] persecution on that's good there josh if
[22:05] you just scroll down to where i'm at
[22:07] if you just scroll down to where i'm at
[22:09] there uh
[22:10] right there this this the one on the
[22:12] bottom the second to last and just
[22:14] yeah right there he says then they're
[22:16] going to be they're going to bring a
[22:18] persecution on pretty soon
[22:20] notice now listen just listen don't pay
[22:21] attention to that listen listen here
[22:23] because this one's important
[22:24] they're going to bring a persecution on
[22:27] pretty soon
[22:28] and shut up all the churches
[22:31] see that in churches like this
[22:34] who's not a nomination they'll use them
[22:36] for a storehouse now
[22:39] these kind of quotes you could k if you
[22:42] go through this document
[22:43] he he goes all the way through to 1964
[22:48] and he makes these statements and people
[22:50] have good people
[22:52] have looked at these things and said
[22:54] this is what's going to happen this is
[22:56] what we're to be looking for this is our
[22:57] expectation
[22:58] and you watch things in the news now
[23:00] it's so important to understand
[23:02] something
[23:03] i'm just going to read it how i wrote it
[23:04] to myself because it was just a note
[23:06] that i
[23:06] that i had put down um it's so important
[23:10] here
[23:12] that we understand that there's
[23:14] something very unique
[23:16] there's something very unique about us
[23:19] the elective
[23:20] i was saying this yesterday at the men's
[23:21] breakfast there's something very unique
[23:24] because we look at everything our
[23:27] perspective of
[23:28] everything is different than the rest of
[23:31] the world
[23:34] i think our perspective of life our
[23:36] perspective of events that happen in our
[23:38] lifetime
[23:40] are very unique our world view if you
[23:42] ever s
[23:43] if you ever watch any kind of debates
[23:44] between atheists and christians or you
[23:47] muslims and christians
[23:48] you'll hear this term world view they're
[23:50] taught it in school it's how you look at
[23:52] the entire world what is your view of
[23:54] the world of time of the linear line of
[23:56] what we call history and time
[23:59] but the the world view that we have is
[24:01] very
[24:02] specific to the bride
[24:06] in fact we don't even share the same
[24:07] world view as the rest of the church
[24:09] nominal world
[24:10] we share some of it but not all of it
[24:13] that's why you'll find
[24:15] the the church nominal world almost
[24:17] believes that
[24:18] republicanism and christianity are
[24:21] synonymous
[24:22] that's a deception
[24:26] now be careful you're not deceived by
[24:27] that same spirit
[24:29] you'll get a lot of people are you a
[24:30] christian i'm a rep i voted for trump
[24:32] didn't i
[24:33] wow when trump is no more a christian
[24:37] than
[24:38] than uh joe biden
[24:43] he said well he did good things well he
[24:45] might have he's a good businessman he
[24:46] had maybe some good desires and good
[24:48] intents
[24:49] some good good desires but as far as
[24:51] being being how are you a christian
[24:53] you're born again by the spirit of god
[24:56] and so this nominal world view is almost
[24:59] very
[25:00] patriotic very you know we're we believe
[25:03] and and there are some things i'm not
[25:05] take dismissing there are some things
[25:06] that are laced in and out of that
[25:08] that are true but we got to be so
[25:10] careful we're not deceived by the
[25:12] deception that's deceiving the rest of
[25:15] the world
[25:16] that's why it doesn't matter who's in
[25:18] the white house doesn't doesn't matter
[25:20] didn't matter the country didn't get any
[25:22] better as far as an eternal perspective
[25:24] when in 2016 when trump was elected
[25:28] it's been in a downward spiral
[25:33] and so boy i'm going to run out of time
[25:36] here
[25:38] and so we don't have the same world view
[25:40] as the rest and you got to be you got to
[25:41] get careful you don't get wrapped up
[25:43] into that stuff
[25:44] and arguments and debates with people
[25:46] about elections and then
[25:48] you get so wrapped up you have to
[25:49] understand your your message
[25:51] is revelation 17 come out of her my
[25:54] people
[25:54] don't be a partaker of her sins so that
[25:56] you receive not our plagues
[25:58] and so but so we have a worldview that
[26:01] is unique it's based upon the revelation
[26:04] of the word of this hour
[26:05] but because of that we're always
[26:08] influenced by a prophetic
[26:09] understanding of everything especially
[26:12] end time events
[26:13] so we're sensitive as believers to
[26:15] anything
[26:17] any kind of out of the ordinary
[26:19] occurrence
[26:21] that relates to presidents or elections
[26:23] or gay marriage or
[26:25] israel or russia you look at those
[26:28] things and you're always watching you're
[26:29] attracted to them why because you have a
[26:31] prophetic understanding of things by the
[26:32] random state
[26:34] and so you're sensitive to those things
[26:36] where others maybe wouldn't be as
[26:37] sensitive
[26:38] and so many other issues and let me just
[26:41] say this
[26:42] we've been wrong about applying and
[26:44] placing things in the past we've been
[26:46] wrong about it before well it was
[26:47] hillary
[26:47] well it was you know it's this one it's
[26:49] over here it's you know it's
[26:51] and so we've been wrong and that's okay
[26:55] that's all right you say oh no we better
[26:56] not do it again why it's okay
[26:58] so long as we have the attitude to say
[27:01] lord
[27:02] you can i i admit i was wrong and we
[27:05] allow god a space to
[27:06] interpret his own word by bringing it to
[27:08] pass
[27:10] and so we've misapplied things and we
[27:12] leave it to god though to interpret it
[27:14] i will just pause that and say very
[27:16] briefly i i do believe that kamala
[27:18] harris at that at that
[27:20] inauguration was the fulfillment of
[27:22] brother adam's sixth vision
[27:24] i believe that emphatically i've never
[27:26] in my lifetime seen anything more
[27:28] clear of what brother branham says
[27:31] and i wish so bad i would have the the
[27:33] the images we haven't even displayed it
[27:35] here i know it got it floated around a
[27:37] lot
[27:38] but you have brother branham saying i
[27:39] seen her a woman
[27:41] she was president vice president wearing
[27:43] royal purple
[27:44] have you ever called purple royal no
[27:48] no one never called royal purple now
[27:51] when you refer to purple
[27:52] you say purple you don't say oh what are
[27:54] you you're wearing roy oh that's royal
[27:55] purple you say purple
[27:57] brother brandon was very specific when
[27:59] he said royal purple she had
[28:01] royal purple on he said i've seen her
[28:03] who came into great power in the united
[28:05] states he said you remember you young
[28:06] people remember
[28:07] brother branham said this it'll come to
[28:08] pass it's thus saith the lord or i'm a
[28:10] false prophet
[28:12] and here you have the vice president of
[28:14] the united states wearing
[28:16] what i didn't call it but i can give you
[28:20] news headline after news headline yahoo
[28:22] news nbc news cnn saying
[28:25] kamala harris's royal purple
[28:28] inauguration
[28:30] you think that was an accident no it
[28:31] wasn't an accident
[28:36] and so so a lot of the things that
[28:38] brother branham says about that we
[28:41] it's very unique we look at things
[28:43] completely
[28:44] differently so we there are so many
[28:48] things that the prophet of god said is
[28:49] we just read through some of this
[28:51] document but watch what happens pull up
[28:53] the sudden change
[28:54] uh powerpoint that you had there josh
[28:56] i'm just gonna i'm out of time so we
[28:57] just got to sort of
[28:59] uh pull the parachute here brother
[29:02] brandon
[29:02] begins to say through all of this you
[29:04] can get this document from if you want
[29:05] it's just to study all the way
[29:07] everything he said because
[29:08] good people that's where i was at good
[29:10] precious people
[29:11] have taken some of those things and
[29:13] they've misapplied them and said there's
[29:14] a persecution coming they're going to
[29:15] come and shut our churches watch what
[29:17] biden does watch what he does
[29:18] listen friends i'm not looking to what
[29:20] biden does or the
[29:22] white house does i'm looking to what the
[29:23] word says
[29:26] and so but but many people believe those
[29:28] things now it wasn't that brother
[29:30] branham said those things and they're
[29:32] not going to happen but
[29:33] where they take place is what's
[29:35] important
[29:36] because prior to the feast of the
[29:38] trumpets brother brandon preaches this
[29:40] that
[29:40] what we need today i believe is some
[29:43] good old-fashioned persecution to run us
[29:44] together we find out the church is
[29:46] really persecuted go to the next slide
[29:48] go to the next slide but i believe my
[29:49] brethren he says and absolutely today i
[29:51] hope that the people are spiritual
[29:53] he says that it hadn't been about 12
[29:55] o'clock today when the holy spirit came
[29:56] in the room go past that that was the
[29:58] seals there
[29:59] he says how are we going to lose this
[30:00] great race it's because we're divided
[30:02] how we going to do it we got to stay
[30:03] together we're all believers in god the
[30:05] holy ghost takes us all in it'll be a
[30:06] paradox if god ever gets us together
[30:08] but he will just trust him hold on the
[30:11] virgin birth he knows how to send the
[30:12] persecution that will run us together
[30:16] he says in a court trial and there is
[30:17] where i knew all the pentecostal groups
[30:19] come together then it will take a
[30:20] persecution now what you have to
[30:22] understand brother branham's part of
[30:23] that pentecostal group
[30:25] and he is believing himself a great
[30:28] persecution will bring all the church
[30:29] we'll all be together then
[30:31] we'll all stand together united as one
[30:33] church will all be one big united church
[30:36] what brother adam doesn't realize that
[30:38] god chose him later
[30:39] is that i don't intend to run you
[30:41] together
[30:43] but i actually intend to separate you
[30:47] and he preaches a message the seed shall
[30:49] not be heir with the shock
[30:52] and now his whole perspective of
[30:54] everything about united and coming
[30:56] together and denominational bears will
[30:58] be closed down
[30:58] brother branham realized no he's calling
[31:01] a people
[31:01] out of a people and he's not going to
[31:05] run them together will persecution come
[31:07] sure
[31:08] but not for that elected lady keep going
[31:12] watch this he says brother branham
[31:15] no keep going one more i want to read
[31:17] this one keep going
[31:18] keep going keep going right there oh
[31:21] don't you see where we're at
[31:23] now this is the trumpets pulse because
[31:26] remember
[31:27] just as in the seals something takes
[31:29] place and brother adam's understanding
[31:30] about the white horse writer about the
[31:32] entire bible
[31:33] something takes place before he preaches
[31:36] the feast of the trumpets prior to this
[31:38] message brother branham applies
[31:39] persecution's coming it's going to shut
[31:41] down our churches
[31:42] the squeeze is going to take place it's
[31:44] going to push us out church doors will
[31:45] close we got to be watching for that
[31:47] they're going to make them store houses
[31:49] but now watch what something happens
[31:50] here don't you see where we're at don't
[31:52] you see why them trumpets mean nothing
[31:54] to us they all sounded under the sixth
[31:56] seal you see now why the holy spirit
[31:58] wouldn't let me speak it
[31:59] the heavenly father knows with this
[32:00] bible before me that's the truth
[32:02] go to the next one didn't know it till
[32:05] yesterday
[32:08] didn't know it until yesterday so that
[32:11] means that
[32:12] everything prior to that yesterday he's
[32:15] referring to
[32:16] has to be taken into light of this quote
[32:20] here
[32:21] because i didn't know it till yesterday
[32:23] means the holy spirit revealed something
[32:25] to me
[32:26] in my room where he revealed it come to
[32:28] me and spoke to me i come back and said
[32:29] wife i got it now
[32:30] he just met me in there and told me here
[32:32] it is honey see there it is perfectly
[32:34] just in harmony keep going
[32:36] oh people without him getting quick it
[32:38] might be the last opportunity you'll
[32:39] ever be able to have you don't know what
[32:41] time he might come
[32:42] now the people say what about the so so
[32:44] now paul's that you can you can close
[32:46] that here we're out of time
[32:48] so brother adam goes on in that message
[32:50] feast of the trumpets and he says
[32:52] you see he says a man doesn't choose a
[32:54] wife
[32:55] to put her through suffering he says a
[32:58] man doesn't choose a wife just to beat
[33:00] her and
[33:00] and and persecute her he says she's
[33:02] already found grace in his eyes
[33:05] and he says and if anything comes he'll
[33:07] hold her hand to keep her from it
[33:09] and he says oh his grace is so great
[33:12] upon them
[33:13] and it's so great upon us we unworthy
[33:16] creatures deserving of death
[33:18] but grace kept us through it
[33:21] so brother branham's entire perspective
[33:24] changes
[33:25] on what takes place concerning the
[33:27] rapture and the tribulation
[33:29] and persecution say brother matt does
[33:31] that mean he doesn't teach anymore that
[33:33] there will be church storage clothes and
[33:34] no persecution no he preaches that
[33:37] but he's he places it differently he
[33:40] says the bride won't go through that
[33:42] she'll be raptured will this church
[33:44] close yes
[33:45] but i won't be here when it does
[33:49] will bombs fall yes but i won't be here
[33:52] when it does
[33:55] will they will there be a persecution
[33:57] yes there will but i won't be there
[33:59] when it happens will there be a squeeze
[34:02] there's already one taking place now
[34:06] but it's not physical it has nothing to
[34:09] do
[34:09] with our physical martyrdom but being
[34:11] martyred
[34:12] has nothing to do with physically
[34:14] suffering it has for the bride it's
[34:16] ecclesiastical meaning it's spiritual
[34:19] it's taking place
[34:20] inside of you right now there's coming a
[34:22] purge in the tribulation where plagues
[34:24] will fall and germ warfare and
[34:26] diseases and and they'll cry out for
[34:29] death and they'll look for death and
[34:30] they can't find it
[34:31] there's coming that type of purge but
[34:34] there's also a purge taking place
[34:36] now in the heart of god's elect purging
[34:40] out sin from our life
[34:43] right let's stand to our feet
[34:46] i thought i'd finish today and i'm not
[34:50] that's all right lord thank you for this
[34:52] morning father for last night the
[34:54] communion service
[34:56] i pray father that your word that was
[34:58] spoken last night
[34:59] the spirit the atmosphere that was in
[35:01] this place would just be a continuance
[35:03] today lord
[35:04] may you just fall upon us fresh again
[35:06] this morning
[35:07] and the worship in the singing lord and
[35:09] the ministering of your word in jesus
[35:11] name amen
[35:16] you
