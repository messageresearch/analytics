last wednesday talking about getting in the current of god and it reminded me of some i haven't thought of in a long time another time that the devil almost took my life so i wanted to share it with you tonight before we bring out brother matt if he wants to come out and change over the order of the service so i was a young marine a young marine out in san diego and uh invincible right brother luther right on and um you think you are anyways and i was at the beach and i had swam out way out deep into the pacific ocean not never been in the ocean before but my friend set up swim out as far as you can and i'll meet i'll i can go farther than you and i was like no way so i had to prove him wrong and i swam out as far as i could and left him behind he quit and i kept going and not knowing that he had quit and i was out there and got i tried to swim back and got caught in the curtain it took me under and i fought it and fought it and fought it and fought it and i i was out of strength and some it was i want to attribute it to god but told me just let go just let go stop fighting and i did and when i did the current carried me it carried me probably like almost a mile down the beach where nobody else was and i had to walk all the way back but then when brother jason was preaching on wednesday about getting in the current of god and it's the same thing saints just let go let go and let the current of god take you where it wants you to go wherever that might be and so that's what i'm doing now i'm just finding the current and getting in it and letting go and letting god amen would you stand with me and let's sing the song as we bring brother matt out now are you ready for the word are you ready to let go and let god amen [Music] way let go and let god have his way [Music]

thank you amen good to be here in the house of the lord amen trust you came with an expectation and been wanting to hear some from something from the lord amen i believe that god has something for us turn to psalms chapter 140 if you have your bible actually let's turn to ephesians 6 and i'll read psalms 40 once you're seated ephesians chapter 6 and just verse 10 we'll begin reading amen i'd like to continue on along the lines of where we were two wednesdays i think last wednesday or the wednesday before two wednesdays uh i spoke on never never surrender and i'd like to speak to you tonight along the same lines i'd like to title this the real enemy the real enemy ephesians chapter six finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god pray in always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints lord we just ask for your blessing now as you bow our heads lord and we just ask for your help lord i pray that you would come in a way father only which you can do that lord and that's in a divine way lord i pray for every person that's here each one that maybe would have a need upon their heart we just lift it up to you with hands raised lord asking for your help lord i pray father you'd give us lord your word that you intended lord may it be strength to face the journey of life lord that we're in i pray god that you would just take control of all things both the speaker and the hearer now lord as we commit it all to you in jesus christ's name amen you can be seated i'm going to turn in just a second to psalms 140 where we quoted and brothers you can have the powerpoint just ready uh you may just follow me uh here just for a minute with the scriptures is we're going to cover a few of them just preaching to you tonight on the real enemy and first timothy chapter 3 verse 7 you don't have to turn here i'm just going to quote some of these they can throw it up on the screen if he would if they would want to but the apostle paul speaks of the enemy and he's speaking here even in ephesians 6 of the enemy that we face and in first timothy he says lest he fallen into reproach and the snare of the devil and he gives us this word snare and what's amazing is this this word means a stratagem or a setup it speaks of the preparation like preparing for a trap and he speaks of satan how that he would try to entrap us or to try to snare us uh he says in psalms 140 this is david psalms 140 chapter 5 the proud have hit a trap for me they have set snares for me what you find here and we're going to read a lot of these scriptures is that the devil is a real person and it's not a it's not a we don't we don't use the word god as a uh sorry as we don't use the word the devil as a metaphor for evil all of us here could look at evil in the world and we can identify it you just can point your finger at uh just a multitude of things and you could easily identify that would be evil or that would be wrong you could look at just crime you could look at murder or any kind of evil deed that you'd see in people and you would say that would be evil but evil the the bible speaks of a person called the devil and when you give a person a name it speaks of a person or a personality and so satan is a real person and as much as jesus or we don't use god as a metaphor to describe everything that's good but god is a real person his name is jesus he's a real person he has a real personality and so satan has a real personality he's going to be held accountable as an individual now not as not as a group of we see the symptoms of evil or we see the results of evil and we see all the evil in the world but there's going to be a person who's held accountable for that evil going to be a a there's a real devil and this the bible speaks of film and this is going to be some of what we're covering here today you're going to recognize uh some of what we're just going to look at as things that we told on uh in his sunday school i want you to follow me real closely here in with your bible and they can keep it on the screen if you can't get there in first john chapter 2 verse 18 we're just going to read one verse and then we're going to go to first john chapter 4. first john 2 verse 18 little children it is the last time and as you have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time first john 4 chapter 4 two chapters over verse three beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist now not speaking of the person but speaking of the spirit of the person remember brother branham let's say if i had the spirit of beethoven i would compose music he said if i had the spirit of john dilliger i would i would have a gun and he says and if i had the spirit of christ then i would be meek and humble like christ i would produce christ and so you have a person and then you have the spirit of that person and then you have the works of that person and so he speaks here and he says this is the spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world and you see this all the way throughout the bible you'll see these names that he's referred to and calling him by different traits of his character uh it's all different traits but it's speaking of the same individual jehovah jireh jehovah rapha jehovah nissi those are not different persons but they're attributes of one person they're attributes of jehovah right follow and so the bible speaks of traits and at the same of the devil and it calls him in one place the son of the morning calls him the son of perdition the prince of darkness the man of sin the prince of the or the prince of the power of the air and so this is what the title that jesus gives him that he's the prince of this world he's a real enemy and you say brother matt why is that important because if you don't realize you're fighting a real person not a generic battle not just all of us in just a generic war but there's you've got a real person who is really fighting you really trying to destroy you really trying to corrupt you really trying to battle you it's who you face every day of your life as a believer and he's the bible speaks of that he's a he's the the the prince of darkness in fact jesus goes further and says he's the god of this evil age he's the man of sin the bible refers to him as the anti-christ and so what it speaks of is that in the book of revelations it says there's a a a a a a real devil a real serpent a real enemy who has a real plan who has a real blueprint who has a real idea or a real purpose and paul picks it up and says he's laid traps he has snares he studies you he watches you he knows how to entrap you or to entangle you he knows how to get at you more than anybody else can get at you the devil can yes amen and notice what he says here and i'm just going to take just a minute just to cover some of this just for foundation we know that there's the spirit of christ that works in the world and he's working with a purpose in the body in the mystical body today he's working in our lives he's accomplishing a purpose we have a savior a real man christ jesus the man don't ever think of him as some figment or some energy uh or or some good that you know that the uh the the modern spiritualist world uh worships today as some energy or some supernatural being and and they they they believe in some superpower but he's more than just an essence or more than just a power more than just an energy he's a real man he's a real person and he's right now alive living in glory right now he's he's alive right now he's a living person and and and and though we're though even though we're here on earth his spirit dwells within us that's why galatians 4 says because you are sons god hath sent forth his spirit into your hearts whereby we cry abba father and so yet we know there's another spirit at work just as much as this spirit of christ is at work there's an antichrist spirit at work and just as much as the spirit of christ is possessing and residing in the temples of people the spirit of the antichrist is living in temples of people do you believe that he's living and possessing people some of them christians and when we say christian i'm speaking of a a person who just claims the name or goes to church the world system the whole world today thinks that they're saved and that they're christians and born again because they go to church every sunday this is what john first john 4 3 says this is that spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world so john is saying you've heard of the antichrist coming it's been preached it's been told it's been spoken of uh and you've expected his arrival but beloved wake up amen because that spirit of antichrist is not only here he's working he's moving right now he's at work right now you're waging and fighting war now so we realize that they that antichrist spirit is not we're not waiting everyone's waiting for this uh you know this um this uh figure to appear and surely there will be a figure a false prophet an actual person who becomes satan incarnate but that's not what i'm speaking of here what we what we have to understand is that it's we're not waiting for the sudden appearing or this person to come on uh come on the scene and then suddenly uh you know he overwhelms and takes over churches and takes over people and everyone's worshipping him but right now his this his his workings are right now he's got a church right now he's got followers right now he's got cold apostate hearts that have given themself whether they know it or not over to his purpose and his plans now so rather than his spirit rather than in the future his spirit as much as the spirit of christ is at work his spirit is mysteriously at work now setting up his kingdom in cold hearts now you can you bear with me just a minute while i get through some of this before we get to a real thought and it speaks of the man of sin when he appears and the apostle paul warns of this and he says beloved try the spirits see if they be of god or not because the antichrist spirit is at work right now and so he said the last days there would come false prophets or false christs false anointed ones and they would infiltrate the church preaching another jesus one who we've not preached and and we've already seen the list of those false prophets who have you can look back and point even ones living now of false christs and false anointed ones who's deceived many millions of people and they're deceiving many millions of people right now and people follow them blindly without any discernment at all or whatsoever there's masses and millions of people who are deceived thank god that the bride won't be deceived thank god elected elected have their eyes opened and while the rest of the masses of the world are being deceived god said to elect it wouldn't be possible for them to be deceived listen to this here let no man deceive you by any means for the day that day shall not come except there cometh falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshiped so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is god who i love these words here who opposeth and exalted himself above all that is called god so satan opposes you amen and satan opposes me and satan opposes the true church right he goes after true worship that's what he wants as we said here before he's much more interested in corrupting the church than removing the church he's much more interested in corrupting your heart or your faith or how you view god or how you view the world he's much more interested in corrupting your mind and your spirit and keeping your faith in place then he is removing it all together because that's his desire that's his motive that's his purpose to shipwreck the faith of god's family and he has no more greater desire than to destroy pure worship he tries to destroy everything that's pure in the world he hates purity all the while he loves religion he loves church he loves church more than a lot of church people satan comes to church every wednesday and every sunday he shows up every time the doors are open he loves church he hates purity he hates pure worship but he loves worship he's all for it he's all for it as his brother jason preached on sunday it was just absolutely awesome if you didn't get a chance to hear it go back and hear that by archive the feminization of the church and worship he loves music he loves worship he loves church he loves people but he he despises purity he despises sacredness satan hates sacredness he hates holiness despises it and he wants to rob god of all holiness and purity and and and praise he and this is this is this he uses the systems of the world that's why he's hijacked science he's hijacked education he's hijacked professors and colleges why do you think he doesn't remove them he would rather keep them in place to use them as tools to deceive masses he would rather much rather keep it even though it's a tree of knowledge of good and evil and some of the things go against his purpose and his plans he'd rather keep it in place and he hijacks education he hijacks uh entertainment comedy and he's is and his purpose is to destroy all the sacred you know i thought about this there that is going to be off topic but it was just incredible that you think of even the ten commandments that god gives the children of israel it gives them the law and the ten commandments you know one of the principles one of the overriding principles of the ten commandments is respect it's not all about respect but one of the overriding principles i thought about this the other day is respect all of the ten commandments all of them all ten of them could really come down to that principle that god was establishing if you want a whole society and you want to you want a wholesome society and a wholesome nation and wholesome families he gives them these ten laws and it's all based upon respecting god and respecting each other respect for god respect for his name respect for his day the sabbath it's all about respect it's all about keeping something pure sacred or holy and then he speaks of respect for people respect for family life satan has no respect for family life christian family life that is uh honor your father and mother amen what is it it's respect for family life it's a sacredness a respect for life itself don't murder it goes further than that respect for marriage don't commit adultery respect for people's property don't steal respect for people's reputation don't bear false witness respect respect a healthy whole society this is what god was given is build upon respect and first you respect god that's exactly what hollywood in the world system is trying to destroy and trying to tear down is respect they hate anything sacred or holy or respectful even even a com a popular comedian i don't remember his name now he was just on on on tv and and made it made a statement and said we intend we intend to leave nothing sacred and that's what they've done with comedy they've removed all sacredness out of everything they've removed the sacredness of marriage that's why they attack marriage in the courtroom that's why they attacked marriage in their in their agenda they they attacked relationships the sacredness of of a marriage being between one man and one woman they they they want to this is their this is what he said we intend to leave nothing sacred and i thought that if that isn't exactly what the devil's primary motive is to strip the world of all sacredness and naivety to to take children and rob them of their purity amen and and he uses tv he uses you say brother matt he doesn't come right out there and do it no but through all of the the different devices as paul said will be not ignorant of his devices he uses television he uses youtube he uses facebook he uses movies and entertainment video games these are all devices that satan uses to try to strip people's minds of purity and respect amen and now they wonder why they've lost respect for police they've lost respect for authority they've lost respect for uh rules and regulations respect for the law what happens to a society when you lose the sacredness and the respect of god's word you want to know what happens turn on fox news and you'll see don't turn on anybody else no i'm just kidding read your local newspaper read just look around you look at the world around you this is what happens when you remove respect and this is the purpose of the antichrist spirit but god's law is based upon respect love god love your neighbor respect god respect your neighbor keep things sacred a loss of respect for god always leads to idolatry and immorality and injustice is when you lose respect of that right you could be educated find education have a great education but lose your respect for god lose your respect for his word and you've lost all sacredness and purity and satan hates purity are you here he hates it this is why paul said in second corinthians 2 lest we be ignorant of satan's devices for we he says satan should get an advantage on us and we become ignorant or he outwits us or he outsmarts us for we are not unaware paul says of his schemes of his planning and that's why paul says beloved try the spirits see if they be of god or not you know you should test everything we should as believers and christians we should have enough spiritual discernment to test and try everything in our life that we take in oh uh every every ingest point should be guarded by the word of god every ingest point because it's an influence upon you it's an influence upon your family and you don't even realize sometimes the way that the devil's using something to just influence you remember he just comes to eve and he gives one word just changes one little word and he uses the same exact schemes today it uses anything to get us and before we know it we're completely our mind how we view church how we view church habits how we view christianity how we view dress code how we how we how we view these things it's incredible sometimes that a man of god can preach straight from the word of god and believers get offended yeah amen amen it should be a wake-up call this man didn't give his opinion i mean i i'm just gonna say it here you heard brother jason preach straight from the bible straight from the word of god it's incredible to me that anyone would have any hard time receiving amen something straight from the word of god and we're believers and this should be our appetite this is this we should be hungry for this [Applause] [Music] oh friends i'm not judging you or condemning you i'm saying god help us to to protect and make sure we try the spirits make sure we clean out all of our channels so that if anything that would block us from receiving the word of god amen we should be able to receive that purely before you know it satan is so used hollywood and and and whatever whatever venue you want to give because that's not that's not everybody's battle but whatever way whatever point satan can give you before you know it he so clogs up the channels and deforms you and distorts your thinking that now you're hearing the word of god and and you're and it's like a log jam it's not it's not you're not taking it and it's like it's right here it's right in the most purest form yeah beloved try not this try not to believe not every spirit but try them see whether they be of god or not so we understand we're not contending against flesh and blood but against spiritual wickedness in other dimensions for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against spirit against principalities and powers in high places spiritual wickedness in other dimensions not ones that you can see but ones that are very much real very much real listen friends we're in a real war and a real battle we don't say we're in a war i'm not speaking i i i hope this sinks in here tonight i don't use spiritual war as a metaphor to describe what we're in i mean it literally you're in a spiritual war it's a real battle if anything real war or going to afghanistan or whatever you want to name or wars upon wars really that's only a metaphor to describe the real war if anything that's the that's just a metaphor to describe because human battles are only influenced or are happenings from spiritual wars or or or or no matter what you want to name in a physical realm it's only an attribute of an influence from a spiritual realm amen and a real spiritual world i read some i've read these before i just want to read them again lord just put it upon my heart here at the end if you want to display that powerpoint brother josh listen to what brother branham speaks of and these are going to be familiar to you but i want you just to read them uh if you could you have that powerpoint if not we'll just okay good now here notice what brother madam says here here's two spirits calling one to another i only wish that my lovely audience could be in this dimension and see this this woman standing here is suffering with the same thing that woman sitting there with her hands crossed like that and he says here's a dark line because the spirit that's on this woman is calling to this spirit for help and it's both the same disease arthritis which is a demon as brother adam said what is a demon spirit it means tormentor so demon is anything that would try to torment you and he uses arthritis to torment people he uses physical disease and he sends those to torment to torment you now we know that god uses that the same exact thing as paul was given a thorn in the flesh to keep him humble so satan god's purpose to give you a thorn remember this is never to torment you it's never a tormentor it's never to give you bitterness it could be to keep you humble or to put something in the way so that you don't go the wrong way but anytime satan gives you a sickness or attacks you in your marriage your relationship or your home or your health or no matter what area he attacks you in it's always to torment you because he's a tormentor and brother branham says the the spirit that's on this woman is calling to this spirit for help and it's both the same disease notice that here's two spirits now here's a prophet with a the vision to be able to the gift to be able to see into another dimension that's as real as the physical dimension these two women were in amen yet they couldn't see that there was something a spirit that was connecting with a dark line brother branham said there was a spirit that was connecting them and they had no idea wow had no idea that the same spirit that was on her was on her brother man says i only wish my lovely audience could see this listen to this as earnestly contending what if i told you that your heart trouble can be made well in jesus name you believe it then go just a minute and then brother madam says demons screamed something called for help demon power it come from the audience when this woman was killed that spirit screaming to one another for help it's the spiritual world we're not talking about the outside it's the spiritual you know why we we display these things to give you a peek just into another dimension in another world that is still here and is more active than it was in 1959 when brother adam preached 1962 when brother adam preaches this it's more active now more so than ever before because as time goes further and time goes further the bible says he has great wrath and great fury knowing that his time is short and so brother adam says notice demons screamed they screamed out they cried out in another dimension in another dimension listen to this friends they're just as real as you're real and i see them many times when they leave right i've seen them leave right from this platform here i see them some of them in shape of bats look like long hairs hanging on their legs but an epileptic demon looks like a tortoise with round legs some of us ought to be glad we can't see that of the dimension he says looks like a tortoise with round legs hanging up like that but usually a demon of oppression seems to be more of a cloud form a demon of oppression like a wave and it just makes a real funny sound when you're in that other dimension to see the spirit now these are just a few examples brother adam gives here of demon powers just a few these are just a couple little snippets notice what he says here he says now you may think that's wrong but some of these days you'll realize if you could only take a spiritual looking glass and look in your soul you doubt and you'd find out what it looks like and the greatest devil the chief of all devils is unbelief incredible so paul says there's beings they're they're real they're as real as you or i are they're angels of influence it's the who is it it's the real enemy it's not your brother it's not your sister it's not your problem that you think is so great in your life right now no matter who it is or who you want to name or what you want to name the real enemy is the devil and his real purpose is to defect you to destroy you to to distort you to deform you in any way that he can even if it's a small victory or a small way and satan knows all he can get is just a small little level of victory in your life trust me he'll take it amen he'll take it and he'll come in the form of a complex it'll come in the form of a fear it'll come in the form of a spirit of some of some activity or some recreation or something any kind of foothold he can get in your life to trap you and to ensnare you and to entangle you real beings in a real supernatural world that is there all the time you know it speaks of the devil and it says he's like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour not that he's a lion but he goes about like a lion in job where have you been satan oh just going to and fro in all of the earth now remember the earth is his kingdom this is his world hello hello jesus says this is he's the god of this world he's the god of this age this is his kingdom remember jesus said if this were my world if this was my kingdom my subjects would come and fight but that's that's that's coming but that's not now but now we're living in his world in his territory that's why he can control the white house that's why he can control politics that's why he controls the entertainment uh world of the of the world that's why he's the prince of the power of the air that fourth dimension and he he he operates in that dimension he operates in that unseen world and he preys upon complexes where have you been oh seeking going about seeking whom i may devour this is his world this is this is what he uses this is his game this is his plan this is his purpose and he says he's seeking whom i seeking whom i may devour he's like a lion seeking whom he may devour the bible speaks of him as a serpent i don't know i don't care understand people who like snakes i know why i don't like snakes i just read my bible and it says that old serpent called lucifer and i hate the devil and so i hate snakes you may like them i don't i kill everyone that i see unless it's a good one that i know is gonna you know kill rats and other animals there are there are i guess you could say i won't say there's good snakes but i'll say that there's snakes that serve a good purpose right and so but notice that it calls him us a snake he's a serpent he's like a prowling enemy the the bible speaks of him and calls him in one place and i think i have it here in my notes uh and one place is called abaddon let me just find it yes his names the bible refers to him as satan abaddon you know what that means in the in in in greek at me it's apollyon you know what it means destroyer destroyer would you ever attribute god to a title like destroyer no this is something there's a title given to the devil he's like he's a destroyer he's beelzebub if you knew what some of these names mean you would see how evil this is descriptors of how evil he is he's he's in one place called blile you know his name lucifer there's nothing good about those names he's just the descriptions of the of the of this man is subtle wicked unclean evil lying proud he's typed as different animals all throughout the bible a serpent a snake in the grass a red dragon and powerful a prowling lion now would you ever want to be locked up in a room a 10 by 10 room with a lion a snake and a dragon raise your hand young people would you ever like i know you think that'd be cool but really it wouldn't would you ever like to be in a room with a snake a lion and a dragon do you know that every time you're in your room and you pull up the internet and you pull up instagram and you pull up your facebook and do you realize that you're in that room with that little dragon and that lion and that snake say for the matter are you preaching again no i'm just i'm not preaching that against that at all i'm letting you know you should be on guard because you have a real enemy who will use any device or anything he can to destroy you brothers do you know every time you go you you go to prayer and you get on your knees and you bow your head and you say jesus and you enter into another spiritual dimension as much as there's as much as there's angels and a heavenly father there there's a there's a demon spirit and a destroyer trying to hinder you brother matt why is it so hard to pray well let me tell you he's the prince of the and has the power of the air the atmosphere so it's so hard to pray today because the atmosphere is against prayer it's against consecration it's against anything that's why you've got to sometimes you've got to labor you've got to you've got to work you you feel like you've got to really enter in or push in or pray through because this world is not my world it's not my home but you've got a real enemy do you realize every time i just want to bring clarification to that to go a little bit further every time you're in your your your own your uh no matter where you're at whether it's on a phone or not that spirit that comes to you and starts whispering to you and talking to you and trying to discourage you and depress you and oppress you he's subtle he's wicked he's unclean so anything unclean that comes in your mind came from him amen is this is what the devil speaks of him he's an entrapper he tries to ensnare and tries to entrap us i just just struggling to know which way to go and honest i'll go this this way just for a moment he speaks of this and he says in first timothy 3 7. let me read second timothy 2. if you have that pull it up on the screen second timothy chapter 2 and if you have your bible you can turn there with me too if they don't get it on the screen in time second timothy chapter two let's just read one verse i'm just going to read this just to save time this is verse 26 and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him notice that who are taken captive prisoner ensnared by him at his will we we read first timothy where it says lest he fall into the reproach and the snare or the entrapment of the of the devil and so you notice that satan is a schemer he's he's a planner you know many times satan has trapped us if we'd be honest i've been victim many times to his traps in my life lose my temper and then go back and lost my temper did something wrong and man i can just trace it after you get over it and you're done venting and you're repenting and your heart's humble again you trace it back and look all the back and go oh that dumb devil and you you you notice you watch the way he ensnared you or entrapped you and sometimes intricate intricate traps well-planned well-devised well-thought-out and listen to me brother and sister it's not a trap to go oh i got you no it has nothing to do with ha ha i got you it's all trying to destroy you he's trying to if he can't destroy you and take you off the earth he'll try to scar you or burn you or maim you he's burned many people and maimed many people maimed their marriages maimed their took them in childhood his teenage years and lives through the rest of their days with because of traps and ensnarements and places where satan has trapped them and snared them and now they lived with live with some of those scars are you here the wicked notice this is psalms 119 and you're going to have to be real good here with the um the scriptures i'm just gonna go through them quickly psalms chapter 119 notice this here in verse 1 110 psalms 119 this is what david says he says the wicked now who's the wicked the devil he's going to give him a name because we're speaking of a person we're not speaking of an energy we're not speaking of a metaphor to describe something bad but know your enemy call him out by name that's what brother branham said to do he said call him out boo devil speak to him as who he is he's not just some some wicked force but david says the wicked notice this this is satan have laid a snare for me yet i air not from thy precepts notice psalms 124 verse 7 our soul is escaped as a bird this is psalms 124 verse 7. our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers the snare is broken and we are escaped that's a testimony of a believer we have we've escaped thank god so notice he says these are satanic setups these are snares or entrapments ways to entangle you and if any way that he can he'll try to entangle you and entrap you and he'll use anything in your life notice i'm just gonna read this is a very familiar one be sober this is first peter be vigilant this is the warning to the christian be sober be vigilant you know that scripture he says because your adversary the devil first peter 5 because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour feast upon feed upon seeking whom he may devour this is why paul says don't be ignorant unless he get a an advantage on you don't be ignorant of his devices so satan comes to us and listen to me our enemy will come to us at all seasons of our life you think life is just particularly hard now it will be in the next season and it will be in the next season and it will be in your older season your younger season your middle-aged season because you always have an enemy and at any season whether it's good times or bad times high times or low times sick times healthy times satan will attack you in any season low high good bad and he traps us and ensnares us he uses camouflage he uses ways to disguise himself as maybe something that seems so harmless and it doesn't seem like there's anything wrong with he'll use he'll use trickery he'll use good people people that you love and he'll use bad people he'll use enemies good times and bad times and he'll try to track us try to trap us and ensnare us you say brother matt then what do we do we pray for spiritual discernment as believers to try every spirit see if they be of god or not let the word of god you know what will always expose the devil the word will always expose the enemy amen take it back to the word of god give it the word test as brother branham says it'll always expose the enemy and one of the greatest things we could do by the preaching of the word of god is to expose the devil in your life i say lord give us preaching give me give me the word of god that exposes the traps of the devil in my life and if he's trying to entrap me or ensnare me expose him lord expose him for who he is don't let him hide under the cover of camouflage but expose him in my life in every area of my life oh i just want to ask you could you raise your hands and say lord expose the devil and all of his workings in my life you know david walked right into a satanic trap an ensnarement i think we've learned more about the attack of the enemy by through david's life than any other man in the bible and david comes to a place in his life and you know the story very well when he walked right into a trap and he was caught he was called and you notice that if you read all the way through and this is this is this is important and i don't really have time to get into this here on a wednesday night but if you look and you read through first samuel before you ever read about the sin with bathsheba you know what you should do is go back and read the lead up to the entrapment because oftentimes that's more important than the trap itself when you ask what what happened how did you get to this place not just where you fell but what conditions were around your life what was happening that that led you to this place and you know what happens to david and he was this was at a time when he was that he was he wasn't he wasn't in the caves he wasn't running he wasn't hiding he was well to do he was well off he was healthy he was strong financially just fine you could say he was on the high he was he was on a high not on a low sometimes we're on a high and sometimes we're on a low this is david at a high amen remember he'll attack at any season of your life and he comes to david in what you could call a high time of his life to where he just seemed like he had everything he wasn't running no longer a fugitive no longer living in caves you know and and running from the enemy but now he's at a he's well established he's well he's he's he's secure he's solid his family his life is home i don't read anything that i could find that was necessarily what you could say is in disarray or out of order but david now he's not in depression he's not writing psalms of discouragement he's he's not writing psalms to you know of of of of of true of enemies trying to destroy him but he said a good time is when life seems to just be flowing right and everything's going good and he's blessed and he's prosperous and he's loved and he's adored and he's the great king and then satan comes right in the moment of that great victory right in the right in the moment of the height of that great victory of what you could say for david would be a high time in his life and david is victorious he's conquering he'd been fighting on the front lines you go read and in first kings i think it's chapter 12 and david had been fighting the chapters before that he had been fighting uh the philistines and and and he had been getting victory i forget the army that he had just defeated and he had not fully defeated them and he had he had gotten victory and they had almost wiped out the entire army but there were some left over and so a season goes by in his life and then the bible says and it came to pass at the time when kings go to war so here's a season of david's life when he's at war he's fighting and now winner comes and there's a time of peace and he's at home he's in the castle and there's no war and then it comes to pass at the times when every other year david would saddle up he'd get his armor he'd get a sword he'd get his shield he'd wait for his leaders and his commanders and his captains and he would go to battle except this time he stays home amen except this time david decides for whatever reason to stay in jerusalem and it's at this moment when the rest of the army are off battling and off to war that david finds himself in his castle not at war not fighting with his sword down remember not not necessarily backslidden i hope i can just just say this here today i i don't have the authority of the scripture to say this is exa we don't have the details to this but let me just just preach to you here for a moment to say it wasn't necessarily a time where david's backslidden or do anything necessarily wrong he's just not in his post of duty and you know it's so important to be at our post of duty doing what god has called us to do and not off on the sidelines somewhere you say brother and i but i'm not doing anything wrong not necessarily didn't say you were but are you doing what the lord has called you to do are you on the front lines when it's a time of war when god is when when god is expecting something and others are depending upon you amen but i'm not i'm not brother you don't understand brother man i stream i still stream and i'm i may not be there physically but i'm still streaming with you guys and i'm i'm still praying and i'm not backslidden i better preach this from down here they can still see me on the camera though but um i'm just but are you are you doing what the lord's called you to do when you should be at war when you should be standing with your comrades amen where are you at david where what what's what's happening in your life it wasn't necessarily he was backslidding off doing something that he shouldn't be doing but he wasn't at his post of duty when god had called him to war when god had called him and said in like ephesians 6 paul says put on the whole armor of god well why put on the armor if you're not going to war put on the whole armor put on the helmet of salvation put on the sword take the sword of the spirit helm the the the shield of faith amen with all prayer your have your feet shod with the gospel of the preparation of peace but why put on armor why have a breastplate why have a helmet why have a sword unless god intends that we're going to be in a fight we're going to be in a struggle then we're going to have to have something to quench the darts of the enemy said brother man what does that mean let means to wake you up to tell you god intends for you to be at war amen and a struggle i'm a disciple you're also called to be a soldier so we preached two wednesdays ago you're also called to be a farmer you're also called to be an athlete to run the race to fight the good fight of faith amen amen somebody amen somebody and and it's it's a it's a real war if you don't believe you're in war you won't be prepared for what's coming to strike your home and your family and your mind you'll be called ill-prepared if you don't realize that you're in a battle you don't realize you're in a war i want to say lord i want to be ready i want to be ready lord don't let me be called you know don't don't let me be called unprepared when the enemy comes knocking on my door let me be prepared for the battle amen let me be prepared for what's coming not disillusioned by this world or the devices of this world let me realize there's a real conflict happening in 2021 right now real hardship a real risk real suffering uh this is this is what jesus says he says that he says that you're to expect tribulation that in this world you should expect trials and tribulation your sheep in the midst or in the middle of wolves trying to destroy you living in the enemy's territory not at home not in jerusalem not in the castle but you're at war and you're not here to make peace or sign a peace treaty with the devil i'm not here to sign a peace treaty with the devil that if i give so much compromise you'll lay off my back i'm not here to sign any peace agreement i'm here to let the devil know i'm at war and i intend to fight i intend to fight and wage war to the last breath in this body i'll fight against the enemy we we spoke last time on churchill and played an entire video of of his just a compilation of some of his inspiring speeches you know that no matter how much he warned them and warned them and warned them with all of his all of his warnings and continual warnings of of germany and the and the threat that they were facing did you know that most of the the brit brit uh the british people and all the rest of the british leaders they called it warmongering that that's what churchill was doing and ended up signing the peace treaty yeah with the devil with the enemy you know what it got him it almost got him destroyed scientists signed a signed a peace treaty and and and you know what happened they eventually had to declare war anyway no matter all the peace talks that they tried eventually they realized it wasn't going to work let me just tell you right now no matter how much you think you can sign a peace treaty with the devil you'll eventually realize you're going to have to someday either be taken prisoner or declare war on the devil either you'll be taken prisoner completely captive with your family and your children and that's happened sadly to so many people or you'll take your sword of the spirit and the shield of faith and the helmet of salvation and say i might have lost some battles but i'm going to win the war i might have some scars and i might have messed up and i'm not going to sit here and cry about all my mistakes but here's what i'm going to do i'm going to take the sword of the spirit i'm going to charge the line of the enemy hallelujah you got to expect to be in a struggle in a fight in a war not a not not staying home in jerusalem david but on the front lines of the enemy on the front lines at your post of duty because others the whole rest of the army is depending on you it's dependent on me i'm dependent on you you know we are we we make up as a family as a body of believers this church is made up of families and i need you as the song says i need you to survive you need me to survive and what strength is that we we draw strength from each other you want strength from your family strength from the body of christ you've got to join with the body of christ you've got to assemble with the body of christ amen amen amen even though this is just one and i wasn't going to read this i'm going to read it even though large tracts of europe this is churchill and many old and famous states have fallen or may fall into the grip of the gestapo and all the idiots apparatus of nazi rule we shall not flag or fell let me just tell you right now i'm going to say it for the devil many preachers might have fallen aside many deacons might have fallen by the wayside many families may have turned their back on the truth and walked the other way but we shall not flag or fail we shall not surrender we're going to keep fighting until the last breath in our body we're going to keep contending and waging war and you say brother matt where are you going to fight you might have lost the beach so i'll fight in the field all right you might have lost the city streets i i'll fight in my prayer closet i'll fight in the pulpit i'll fight at work i'll fight at church i'll fight it done in the workplace but here's one thing i'm never going to surrender i'm never going to give in to the devil amen we're at war war against hell against hell against hell and all of its hellish demons and devils and spirits you're at war amen and none of us are exempt none of us no matter how spiritual or how non-spiritual you feel today not one of us are exempt all of us are fighting it at different levels in different ways and different avenues at different times and different aspects and some of us raising small children some of us raising teenagers some teenagers who are fighting real wars and real battles with us some older some elderly some young some spiritual some maybe not so much some may be this high and some maybe this high but let me just say this man your post stay at your post of duty find the devil where he's fighting you a wage war with the enemy don't surrender don't give up because i need you you need me we need each other and we've got to realize we've got a real enemy who wants to destroy us he wants to rob our church of real worship he wants to rob us if we're of real spiritual he wants to isolate us and separate us as much as he can amen you say brother matt what's really that's really what's on my heart just to say that to you today satan is trying to separate and destroy and distort and and lie and make any kind of schism or any listen friends let me just say it lord clean my channels today lord inspect every area of ingest point in my life no matter where it's at take it inspect every uh cavity of my mind and my spirit
