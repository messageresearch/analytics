[2:34] if you have your bible let's go to
[2:36] genesis chapter 11
[2:39] amen genesis chapter 11.
[2:43] i'd like to just look at something here
[2:45] just maybe for this morning that
[2:48] we were in a conversation some
[2:50] fellowship uh
[2:51] friday evening i think it was and the
[2:53] lord just started to uh
[2:54] put this upon my heart so i thought i'd
[2:56] cover it here today
[2:58] i'd like to speak to you on the mark of
[3:00] cain the mark of cain let's look at
[3:02] genesis chapter 4
[3:04] and brothers i have a pdf if you have
[3:07] that ready i sent you can just display
[3:09] it and scroll with me
[3:10] amen genesis chapter 4 and we'd just
[3:12] like to
[3:14] begin reading here let's begin
[3:19] at verse seven let's let's actually go
[3:22] back beyond that let's go all the way to
[3:24] verse four
[3:27] and abel he also brought up the first
[3:29] liens of his flock
[3:30] and of the fat thereof and the lord had
[3:32] respect unto abel and
[3:33] his offering but unto cain it is
[3:36] offering he had not respect
[3:37] and cain was very wroth and his
[3:39] countenance fell and the lord said unto
[3:41] cain why art thou wroth
[3:43] and why is thy countenance fallen if
[3:45] thou do as well
[3:46] shall thou not be accepted and if thou
[3:49] do is not well
[3:51] send lieth at the door and unto thee
[3:54] shall be his desire
[3:55] and thou shall rule over him and cain
[3:58] talked with his brother
[4:00] abel and it came to pass when they were
[4:01] in the field that cain rose up against
[4:04] abel his brother and slew him
[4:06] and the lord said unto cain where is
[4:08] that where is abel thy brother
[4:10] and he said i know not am i my brother's
[4:13] keeper
[4:14] and he said what is thou done the voice
[4:16] of thy brother's blood cryeth unto me
[4:18] from the ground
[4:20] and now are thou cursed from the earth
[4:23] which hath opened her mouth to receive
[4:25] thy brother's blood
[4:27] from thy hand when thou tilt the ground
[4:30] it shall not henceforth yield unto thee
[4:33] her strength
[4:34] a fugitive and a vagabond shall thou be
[4:38] in the earth
[4:39] and cain said unto the lord my
[4:40] punishment is greater than i can bear
[4:43] behold thou has driven me out this day
[4:45] from the face of the earth
[4:47] and from the faith and from thy face
[4:51] shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive
[4:54] and a vagabond in the earth and it shall
[4:55] come to pass that every one that findeth
[4:58] me
[4:58] shall slay me and the lord said unto him
[5:02] therefore whosoever slayeth cain
[5:04] vengeance
[5:05] shall be taken upon him sevenfold
[5:08] and the lord set a mark upon cain lest
[5:11] any finding him
[5:13] should kill him and cain went out from
[5:15] the presence of the lord and dwelt in
[5:17] the land of nod
[5:18] on the east of eden you can be seated
[5:21] this morning
[5:23] we answered the very simple direct
[5:26] question
[5:27] what was the mark that god put upon cain
[5:30] and i don't think we have
[5:31] uh we could speculate and all of us
[5:34] could could uh
[5:35] come up with a different revelated um
[5:38] you know broke down a type or idea that
[5:41] we can have we don't really know not
[5:43] that i'm aware of that we have
[5:44] any specific um uh definition that the
[5:48] bible gives us or the prophet really
[5:50] gives us though he gives us
[5:51] enough and i'd like to look at that here
[5:53] today just for a moment
[5:55] what was this mark and brothers i have
[5:58] that
[5:58] um i have that pdf if you can display
[6:02] that i'd like to look at a few things
[6:03] here that the prophet of god
[6:05] says because i think this ties directly
[6:08] in
[6:08] with the mark of the beast when you say
[6:11] the mark of cain
[6:12] you're referring to the mark of the
[6:13] beast so then we ask the question
[6:16] what is the mark of the beast and
[6:19] if you want to go into the weeds
[6:22] just google that one time and you will
[6:24] find about every definition
[6:26] uh and every idea that people have came
[6:30] up with about what the mark of the beast
[6:32] is
[6:32] there's a lot of conspiracy surrounding
[6:34] it you'll you'll find it today on the
[6:36] internet
[6:37] people constantly putting out something
[6:39] that the government does or some law in
[6:41] congress or something and it's
[6:43] it's always about this mark of the beast
[6:45] i think it's interesting because uh it's
[6:47] upon
[6:48] people's minds today now more than it
[6:51] ever has been before
[6:53] and you could you could kill that side
[6:54] screen if you can um
[6:57] yeah i wouldn't open it in the browser
[6:59] i'd go to the actual finder
[7:00] and then open it in uh and preview i
[7:03] wouldn't open it
[7:04] in the in the in the browser it's going
[7:05] to display that you we don't need it
[7:07] right this second
[7:08] so we look at this uh
[7:12] i have just some slides and we'll read
[7:14] some quotations from the prophet that i
[7:16] i just thought was real important to
[7:18] cover but what's important to understand
[7:20] is that
[7:21] here uh god drives out this wasn't just
[7:25] a specific location as we've said
[7:28] many times before but it's actually
[7:32] being expelled from the presence of god
[7:35] because that's what adam and eve uh were
[7:38] expelled from it wasn't just a garden or
[7:40] a physical location or geographical
[7:43] location
[7:44] but it was from the presence of god
[7:47] that adam and eve are driven from and
[7:49] then cain also
[7:51] says i'll be driven away and i'll be
[7:53] hidden
[7:54] from your face and so they're driven out
[7:56] from the presence of god
[7:58] a place where they had access to
[8:01] all of the spirit of god all of it 100
[8:04] of it
[8:04] whereas today we just have a portion and
[8:07] we we have access to the presence of god
[8:09] but we get that
[8:10] in uh we're not always living there
[8:13] there's times when we
[8:14] fill the presence of the lord in times
[8:16] when if we'd be honest
[8:17] um at a stoplight in traffic we're not
[8:20] always in that presence of god
[8:23] and so something something will happen
[8:25] to you and then immediately you realize
[8:28] just how close your carnal flesh uh can
[8:31] be
[8:32] amen but but here
[8:35] adam and eve had this constant access
[8:38] always in the presence of the lord
[8:40] you know that's really what eternal life
[8:42] is to know him is life
[8:45] and so he's the source of all life and
[8:48] so
[8:48] there was no death there was no there
[8:50] was no dying there was no
[8:52] uh no degrading no no
[8:55] corrupting there was no law of
[8:57] corruption in
[8:58] human beings at that time but sin brings
[9:02] in a law of corruption
[9:03] and and being driven from the presence
[9:06] of god
[9:07] brings in that law of corruption and so
[9:10] man becomes the bible says in genesis 3
[9:13] 23 you don't have to turn i'll just read
[9:15] it to you
[9:15] therefore the lord god sent him forth
[9:18] from the garden of eden to till the
[9:19] ground
[9:20] from whence he was taken so man becomes
[9:23] earthbound
[9:25] where he's there is there is there is a
[9:28] a a a a barrier now that wasn't there
[9:32] before
[9:33] there's a curse there that wasn't there
[9:36] before
[9:37] he's possessed when i say earthbound
[9:40] i mean it more than just the soil or the
[9:43] trees or the planet
[9:46] but this this is earth right here your
[9:49] body that you have
[9:50] is part of the earth amen
[9:54] so your your body is part of the earth
[9:56] so now you're bound to
[9:58] five senses you're bound to a carnal
[10:01] nature
[10:02] you're you're bound to carnality that's
[10:05] that's what sin
[10:06] really is a corruptible nature
[10:10] and so the the the the
[10:13] uh you have that ready gideon if you
[10:15] have that just go ahead and display that
[10:17] i want to read these
[10:18] right here so the prophet of god says
[10:22] here
[10:23] he says and remember that we found out
[10:25] that we found without one mistake
[10:28] that the mark of the beast is a mark of
[10:31] apostasy
[10:32] that's really clear the mark of the
[10:34] beast is a mark of apostasy there you go
[10:37] you can just display it full screen
[10:39] and then you can zoom in use the track
[10:41] pad and pinch the zoom there you go
[10:43] up up up more you've got to go a lot
[10:45] until they can see it
[10:48] there you go yep can you see that all
[10:50] right there in the back
[10:52] and then just try to scroll over so that
[10:54] it stays center
[10:56] good job good job
[11:00] and remember that we found without one
[11:02] mistake
[11:03] the mark of the beast is a mark of
[11:06] apostasy
[11:08] that is church members hanging to their
[11:11] churches
[11:12] instead of walking in the light boy that
[11:15] really brings it real simple and really
[11:18] close to home
[11:20] now it's not a microchip
[11:25] right now it's not something they insert
[11:28] in your skin
[11:31] the mark of the beast is a mark of
[11:33] apostasy
[11:35] it's a branding that's what brother
[11:37] branham calls it it's a branding
[11:39] and not not it's it's a sense of it's a
[11:42] it's a sign of ownership
[11:43] listen let's just keep going that is
[11:45] church members hanging to their church
[11:48] instead of walking in the light they
[11:50] reject
[11:51] light and there's nothing left by
[11:54] darkness that's right both
[11:56] catholic and protestant these are just
[12:00] split up in into different quotes here
[12:02] so we'll just read them as
[12:03] as as they come the mark of the beast
[12:06] question mark is to reject the holy
[12:09] ghost
[12:10] a mark of apostasy where do you say the
[12:14] mark of the beast begin
[12:16] now listen here where we just read in
[12:18] the in the garden of eden
[12:20] mark of the beast and the sill of god
[12:23] was performed
[12:25] in the garden of eden aha now paul's
[12:28] looked this way
[12:29] now we have a parallel here a mark of
[12:31] the beast
[12:32] and a mark of the holy ghost they're the
[12:35] same
[12:36] a mark of the beast and the mark of the
[12:37] holy ghost what do we what do what does
[12:39] the bible say grieve not the holy spirit
[12:41] whereby you are sealed and remember
[12:44] the random said that was the seal of the
[12:47] uh
[12:47] uh at the the railroad uh boxes he said
[12:50] he would seal that to give his stamp of
[12:53] approval that it was
[12:54] ready it was packaged and ready so when
[12:56] you're sealed with the holy ghost
[12:58] you're marked by the holy ghost
[13:03] right remember the bible speaks of a
[13:05] separated
[13:06] angel that would come and when the weed
[13:08] the wheat and the tares were growing
[13:10] together and jesus said don't try to
[13:11] separate them now
[13:13] and he said but later the angels will
[13:14] come and separate them
[13:16] and so there was what are they
[13:18] separating them mark
[13:20] and a seal both of them
[13:23] notice what he says here he says where
[13:24] did you say the mark of the beast and
[13:25] the guard of the beat the mark of the
[13:26] beast and the sill of god was performed
[13:28] in the garden of eden that's the very
[13:30] top if you're trying to find that
[13:32] next paragraph now we find out
[13:35] that the first marking of a human being
[13:37] started in genesis
[13:39] 4 15 god marked cain
[13:42] that's where the first mark of the beast
[13:44] was ever put out
[13:45] put on was put on cain he is the
[13:48] beginning
[13:50] of it so what is where did the mark of
[13:52] the beast if you say
[13:53] brother matt where did we find the mark
[13:55] of the beast revelation the book of
[13:56] revelations no you could actually go
[13:58] the complete opposite of that and find
[14:00] it in genesis
[14:02] when where the mark of the beast began
[14:04] was in the beginning
[14:06] in genesis when you have abel whose
[14:09] offering is accepted by
[14:11] revelation and cain whose offering is
[14:15] man-made religion so
[14:18] now you see what god was marking there
[14:21] was a separation there was a difference
[14:24] and we know these were these two boys
[14:26] were twins
[14:27] and the prophet of god says there's
[14:29] always been twins throughout the whole
[14:31] bible two lines two seed lines
[14:34] uh twins he says there's twins born out
[14:36] of every
[14:37] revival so twins born out of
[14:41] every revival ours excluded no not ours
[14:44] excluded
[14:46] but but but there's twins born out of
[14:49] every revival out of this revival
[14:51] there's
[14:51] twins how do you separate them
[14:54] one is going to be into you know all
[14:57] kinds of
[14:58] uh of he of uh heathenism and
[15:01] and uh and rock and roll and no no no
[15:04] they're
[15:04] both very religious both very religious
[15:08] everything all right back there guys
[15:10] good okay um i thought they were trying
[15:12] to get my attention
[15:13] so both very very religious
[15:17] kane as we've learned so many times the
[15:19] brother branham saying
[15:20] he was religious he he just like
[15:24] jacob and esau same exact thing twins
[15:27] uh but one despised the the birthright
[15:32] in other words one had no value
[15:35] of the birthright right
[15:38] y'all awake this morning he says
[15:42] let's just keep reading here he says now
[15:44] we find out the first mark
[15:46] that's where cain he says that's where
[15:48] the first mark of the beast was ever put
[15:50] on was put on cain he is the beginning
[15:51] of it
[15:52] now you say cain having the mark of the
[15:54] beast all right let's notice
[15:56] he said thy seed shall bruise the
[15:58] serpent's head
[15:59] and his head shall bruise thy heel watch
[16:02] the lineage of
[16:03] cain as cain come down become
[16:06] scientist smart men great men
[16:10] owned down like that but the seed of
[16:12] seth
[16:13] as it come down become peasants
[16:15] sheepherders farmers
[16:17] so you see there is notice he speaking
[16:19] of cain
[16:21] went out from the presence of god when
[16:24] he was
[16:24] marked two classes
[16:27] one will have the mark of the beast the
[16:30] other one
[16:32] have the seal of god just like canaan
[16:34] seth in the garden of eden comes to that
[16:37] thing
[16:37] many people has placed it way over into
[16:40] a day that's yet to come
[16:41] someplace in he says someplace it in
[16:44] this day but for myself
[16:47] i believe that it began at the same time
[16:49] the holy spirit
[16:51] fell now as this is a different quote
[16:53] referencing something else here
[16:54] that's what the bible said men of old
[16:57] foreordained to this condemnation to
[16:59] turn the grace of our lord into
[17:01] lasciviousness
[17:02] that's exactly right in jude the third
[17:05] verse of jude you can find it
[17:07] notice all those things proving that
[17:10] there is the mark of the beast
[17:12] that there's where it's at
[17:16] and and what's amazing is when you study
[17:19] the book of jude
[17:20] you get that parallel so clear
[17:24] that that that that twin that false
[17:28] church that false religion that false
[17:30] approach that way of cain
[17:32] is so interwoven and interwound
[17:36] with the with the way of god in so much
[17:38] that that even
[17:40] i'm almost tempted to pull it up and
[17:42] read it but you remember in the book of
[17:44] judy says they are
[17:46] spots in your cheat feast of charity
[17:49] and he says they're in other words
[17:51] they're right in church they're right
[17:53] intermingled with you two seeds
[17:56] cain and abel judas and jesus jacob and
[17:59] esau
[18:01] but it's not a physical not that here's
[18:03] what we can we can deduct for sure it's
[18:05] not a it's not a physical
[18:06] bloodline we're all
[18:09] mixed up and messed up all of us here go
[18:12] to ancestry.com if you don't believe me
[18:17] you can you can't trace yourself back to
[18:19] any one pure
[18:20] bloodline you got all kinds of of
[18:24] peoples and and nationalities all kinds
[18:26] of different things in your in your
[18:28] history and it's not about a physical
[18:30] this isn't
[18:31] it never was about a physical bloodline
[18:33] it's about a spiritual
[18:35] mark remember brother adam says the mark
[18:37] of the beast a sign it says a mark in
[18:39] the forehead and the sign on the hand
[18:41] and he says it wasn't
[18:43] he says what is that mark he says it's
[18:44] not a physical mark
[18:46] he said you're the mark in the head the
[18:48] forehead speaks of your revelation
[18:52] and he said in the mark in the hand is
[18:54] what you'll do about it
[18:56] the action that you'll take and he said
[18:58] because some
[18:59] some will just give up a place to the
[19:02] beast
[19:03] they'll do his work they'll do his will
[19:05] we're going to get to that here in a
[19:06] second but it wasn't about a physical
[19:08] uh bloodline or to trace it back to your
[19:11] physical blood
[19:12] but it was he says there's spots in your
[19:14] feast of charity
[19:16] uh feasting feeding themselves without
[19:18] fear
[19:20] raging waves foaming out of their own
[19:22] shame he says these speak
[19:24] these are he says these be they who
[19:27] separate themselves
[19:28] sensual this is this is going to be too
[19:30] much to not get pull up jude
[19:33] pull up jude i just want to turn there
[19:35] real quickly and have that ready to go
[19:37] right back up
[19:38] pro presenter and pull up jude and let's
[19:40] just read it just a few verses of this
[19:42] in fact i i need to pull it up here for
[19:44] myself so
[19:45] jude is just a wonderful little book and
[19:48] i believe it speaks so much to this and
[19:50] brother branham just reference that
[19:51] let's look at jude chapter one and i'll
[19:53] just
[19:54] we'll just go through some of these look
[19:55] at this separation because remember in
[19:58] jude you have the first
[19:59] church you have that first
[20:02] book of acts holy ghost filled
[20:05] fire breathing works and signs church
[20:09] in acts and under the apostles but
[20:12] now you come to jude right before the
[20:14] new testament
[20:15] goes into the book of revelation and
[20:17] then it's going to end and now you get
[20:19] sort of just
[20:20] a uh a a just a shot in time you get a
[20:25] a screenshot to be able to look and see
[20:27] what
[20:28] what's happening in that first church
[20:31] and he says here for there verse 4 of
[20:33] jude
[20:34] for there are certain men crept in
[20:37] unawares
[20:38] who were before of old ordained to this
[20:41] condemnation
[20:42] ungodly men turning the grace of our god
[20:44] into lasciviousness and denying the only
[20:46] lord god and our lord jesus christ and
[20:49] we'll just move on past this
[20:51] and he says in verse 10 but these speak
[20:53] evil of those things which they know
[20:55] not but what they know naturally as
[20:58] brute beasts
[20:59] in those things they corrupt themselves
[21:02] in those things they know
[21:05] naturally intellectually
[21:09] by rationale by deduction by theology by
[21:13] seminary by schooling
[21:16] what they know intellectually these be
[21:19] they let's read it again
[21:20] they speak evil of those things which
[21:22] they know not but what they know
[21:23] naturally
[21:24] carnally is really all it means what
[21:26] they know by their own carnal nature and
[21:28] what do we see in this age more than
[21:30] ever before
[21:31] people trying to to to worship and serve
[21:35] god and and and create a religion based
[21:38] upon
[21:39] education and not revelation what do you
[21:43] see
[21:43] abel and cain all over again
[21:47] is that clear to see and he says in
[21:50] verse 10 they know naturally as brute
[21:51] beasts and those things they corrupt
[21:52] themselves woe unto them for they've
[21:54] gone
[21:54] in the way of cain interesting he brings
[21:58] up this one figure he could have used
[22:00] anybody
[22:01] else but he uses cane right here they've
[22:04] gone in the way of
[22:05] cain so what do you see producing here
[22:07] again
[22:08] that twin out of every revival
[22:10] interwoven right in the church
[22:12] listen he says and greedily after the
[22:14] bail uh he says and and ran greedy after
[22:17] the air of balaam for a reward and
[22:18] perished in the gang said of course
[22:19] these are spots on your feast of charity
[22:20] when they feast with you without
[22:22] he says feeding themselves without fear
[22:23] clouds air without water carried about
[22:25] of winds trees
[22:26] fruit withers without fruit twice dead
[22:28] plucked up by the roots you
[22:30] try to identify this try to try to
[22:32] identify
[22:33] not people but the spirit
[22:36] because people die spirits don't die
[22:40] i said people die you're not going to go
[22:43] back and find these exact people that
[22:45] jude is pointing to he's thinking of
[22:47] specifics
[22:49] you won't find them they're dead but you
[22:50] what you'll find is the same spirit
[22:52] that after they died just jumped on to
[22:54] the next generation
[22:56] and that spirit is still here today and
[22:59] he says they're spots and feasts of
[23:00] charity
[23:01] when they feast defeat himself let's go
[23:03] to 13 raging waves of the sea foaming
[23:05] out their own shame wandering stars
[23:07] to whom reserve the blackness of to whom
[23:09] has reserved the blackness of darkness
[23:10] forever
[23:11] verse 16 these are murmurers complainers
[23:15] walking after their own lusts and their
[23:18] mouth speaketh great
[23:20] swelling words having men's persons
[23:23] in admiration because of advantage
[23:26] and that word advantage actually means
[23:28] skill or eloquence or
[23:30] gift
[23:34] having men's person's an aw admiration
[23:37] boy he just speaks so good what did
[23:40] brother adam tell us about
[23:41] the serpent he was a smooth talker
[23:46] eloquent and he says there he says
[23:51] but beloved but beloved
[23:54] remember ye the words which were spoken
[23:56] before the of the apostle of the lord
[23:58] jesus christ how that they told you
[24:00] there should be these people here should
[24:02] be here
[24:03] don't be shocked don't be alarmed don't
[24:05] be surprised
[24:07] they should be yeah and he says that he
[24:10] says but beloved remember the words were
[24:12] spoken before
[24:13] they told you there should be markers
[24:14] last time who shall walk after their own
[24:15] ungodly lust
[24:16] these now here he's going to continue to
[24:18] identify
[24:20] these be they now it's amazing because
[24:23] paul identifies people
[24:25] directly he identifies hymanius
[24:29] and filthus if you if i'm pronouncing
[24:31] that name right and others
[24:32] who he identifies by name but jude isn't
[24:35] going to
[24:36] there's you won't find a name here you
[24:38] just hear him say
[24:39] these be they they are they feed these
[24:43] they
[24:43] these they because as i said it's not
[24:46] people it's
[24:47] spirits
[24:51] and he says these be they who separate
[24:53] themselves
[24:55] then he uses a very interesting word
[24:56] here sensual
[25:00] sensual
[25:03] you know brother brandon talks about
[25:05] cain and abel
[25:07] and he says any and he begins to
[25:10] dramatize
[25:11] the the offering that cain has and the
[25:14] dramatizing the offering that
[25:16] that abel has and it's amazing when you
[25:20] go back and you listen to what the
[25:21] prophet of god says and he says here was
[25:24] cain he just had this beautiful
[25:28] just beautiful pleasing to the eyes
[25:33] very aesthetically pleasing and
[25:36] perfect and had everything just laid out
[25:39] in this garden and all of his flowers
[25:40] and a man all the
[25:42] you imagine what it must have looked
[25:43] like this how he was gifted he was get
[25:45] gifted to
[25:46] with the things of the of the earth of
[25:48] the ground and he says always just
[25:50] oh it's just so wonderful and emotional
[25:53] it's very emotional
[25:56] you know if we're not careful it's good
[25:59] to have an emotional worship for the
[26:02] lord it's good to have an emotional
[26:04] church service good to have an emotional
[26:05] singing emotional preaching
[26:07] but let's be careful that we don't just
[26:10] so
[26:11] become so emotional that we have no
[26:14] substance
[26:16] and so emotional that there's no real
[26:19] meat
[26:19] there's no real life there it's good to
[26:23] have emotion i hope you don't
[26:24] misunderstand me here today
[26:27] in fact i think that's the last thing we
[26:29] need to be preaching on we need more
[26:30] we need more of it we don't have enough
[26:34] of it
[26:36] but let me just say it's not just about
[26:38] an emotional
[26:39] pleasing aesthetically pleasing it's
[26:41] soothing to the ears we don't just need
[26:43] sermons that are just beautiful sermons
[26:47] because the difference between abel and
[26:49] cain was that abel's
[26:50] wasn't so pretty
[26:54] how very different it brother branham
[26:56] says you can hear that
[26:57] the the the screeching sound from that
[27:00] little
[27:01] that little sacrifice he says his cain
[27:04] took the knife and slit the throat of
[27:06] that
[27:07] little animal and he says and then blood
[27:10] began to come down what was it
[27:12] wasn't as emotional wasn't as beautiful
[27:14] wasn't as you know
[27:16] aesthetic to aesthetically pleasing to
[27:18] look upon and made it didn't make
[27:20] everyone very comfortable
[27:22] didn't make you comfortable when i just
[27:24] repeated it
[27:26] but it was acceptable to god
[27:30] by revelation abel offered a more plea
[27:34] more excellent sacrifice than that of
[27:36] king and god had respect unto abel's
[27:39] offering
[27:40] and so now now think of that here when
[27:43] jude put jude back up for me getting in
[27:45] there
[27:45] he says these be they who separate
[27:47] themselves sensual
[27:50] having here's the most important verse
[27:52] here verse 19 jude
[27:55] verse 19. these be they who separate
[27:57] themselves sensual
[27:59] having not the spirit
[28:03] that is the key differentiating
[28:07] mark of denotation there having not
[28:11] the spirit but you now he points to
[28:14] the spirit filled but you beloved
[28:18] building up yourselves on your most holy
[28:21] faith praying
[28:22] in the holy ghost keep yourselves
[28:28] in the love of god
[28:31] looking for the mercy
[28:34] of our lord jesus christ unto
[28:37] eternal life what
[28:41] an admonishment after just identifying
[28:45] cain's seed after just identifying
[28:48] the way of cain after just identifying
[28:50] this group
[28:51] sensual having out the spirit and you
[28:53] know and all of all of the
[28:55] beloved and believers are feeling pretty
[28:57] good about themselves right
[29:00] and he says hold on a minute but lest
[29:02] you unless you get a spirit of arrogance
[29:04] or a spirit of
[29:05] of of pride in your own self and he says
[29:09] keep yourself in the love of god keep
[29:11] yourself
[29:12] looking for the mercy not the
[29:14] condemnation not the judgment
[29:16] not just to say all the bunch of devils
[29:19] over there and we got god here and
[29:20] they're
[29:20] all all just worshiping the devil keep
[29:24] yourself in the love of god
[29:26] looking for the mercy of our lord jesus
[29:29] christ unto eternal life
[29:30] and of some have compassion making a
[29:34] difference
[29:35] and others save with fear
[29:38] pulling them out of the fire hating even
[29:41] the garment
[29:41] spotted by the flesh now unto him that
[29:44] is able to keep
[29:45] you from falling
[29:48] and to present you faultless before the
[29:51] presence of his glory i say lord
[29:53] keep me from falling and present me
[29:57] faultless before the presence of his
[30:00] glory with exceeding joy to the only
[30:02] wise god our savior be glory and majesty
[30:04] dominion and power
[30:05] both now and forever amen you can stand
[30:08] to your feet this morning
[30:10] lord we thank you for this teaching this
[30:11] morning didn't cover
[30:13] nearly what we wanted to but we just
[30:14] leave that to you lord i pray father
[30:17] that you would continue to
[30:19] lord just visit us here by your spirit
[30:21] lord in this church service today we ask
[30:23] in jesus name amen
