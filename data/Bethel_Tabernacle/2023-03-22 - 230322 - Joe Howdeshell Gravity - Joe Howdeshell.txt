control amen I want him to control every aspect of my life amen if you have your Bibles while you're standing let's turn to Psalm 119. verse 59. so good to be in the house of the Lord tonight it was a little bit of a uh kind of a short notice brother Matt wasn't feeling well he had to work over on Hilton Head and he asked me if I could fill in so I said well brother he said the Lord just gave him the unction so I said well I wouldn't go over that for nothing so let's amen and after you see the title of my message you'll know that the Lord's already working tonight just by the song Choices that amen verse 59 I thought on my ways and turn my feet unto thy testimonies let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful to be here tonight words can't express it Lord to be able to come and just be able to Fellowship Lord in in Freedom in a nice place Lord to gather together with people Lord of Light precious faith Lord we don't count that as a light thing Lord I hope we never take it for granted God we're so thankful to be here tonight and we're just looking and expecting Lord for you to speak to us in a mighty way father we commit this service to you tonight we just have many requests Lord that will bring to you tonight after the service and God would just ask that you would just help me to step out of the way Lord and may you speak in Jesus name we pray amen you can be seated now David is speaking here he said I thought on my ways and turned my feet unto my testimonies and brother Branham said he kind of gave a little a little bit of a um what you would call he called it a panoramic but I guess you could call it a um uh kind of a story that he told him but he talked about how that David was was running from Saul and Saul was after him and he said I could see David was maybe holed up in a house and he was pacing the floor and said every now and then he would go and he would open the lattice and he would look out and he was nervous and he was ringing his hands knowing that Saul was after him and he said that that knowing that any moment that an arrow could come through and Pierce his bosom and he said he got into thinking on his way and he said it's so sad many times that it takes trouble and it takes hardship for you and I to get to a point to where we really start reflecting on our way but that's okay because we sing that song Whatever It Takes Lord whatever it takes for my will to break sometimes God has to get us to a place to where we'll finally call out to him and I don't discount that at all but wouldn't it be great if we could just serve him all the time when the hard times come you're already ready you already prayed up you stayed up you studied up and when the enemy comes in like a flood the Lord's right there to raise up a standard against him but David you know he was thinking on his way and I was thinking many times I've got into situations myself and I've been maybe floating along I've been kind of complacent does anybody else ever get complacent in life you know complacency and I just wrote this down it comes from a place of not caring not being motivated not convinced it says I have time see maybe sometimes you think you got a little more time than what you do have and so you get a little complacent you get a little lacks in your Bible study you get a lacks in your church attendance you get a little lacks in your fellowship you get a little lacks into things that you start watching or the things that you start listening to you start letting down the bars brother Branham used to have a saying we let down the bars and let down the bars and would compromise with sin we let down the bars and the Sheep got out but how did the goats get in now I know any of you listen to tapes I've heard that many times but it's so true if you let down your standards if you let down then something's going to fill that vacuum if you don't keep it filled up with the word of God if you don't keep the Bible says to continually to have Psalms and spiritual hymns and these things going on in our minds not to fill it up with the garbage of this world see brother were y'all able to get that PowerPoint I sent it to an email but I don't know if you could get it or not Bethel Tabernacle at the sound booth okay that that's fine it's not a big deal short notice so we'll just we'll just go with it I told my wife I said I'm gonna grab my Bible and just go and that's the best way to be be instant in season out of season I tell you one thing you better be because you know what you don't always have a whole lot of time to be prepared but you know what better than a PowerPoint is the power of the Holy Ghost amen Lord just give me that tonight that's all I need amen whatever it takes Lord if it's laying me on my back if it's if it's causing me to lose my job lose my home children straying away all kinds of troubles come to us and we start thinking on our way we start maybe Trouble Comes maybe you got a diagnosis from a doctor maybe you just don't have the joy that you used to have all kinds of things can happen in your life and trouble sets in I'm so glad that we have a place that we can run to tonight we have a bomb in Gilead we've got a place that we can just run to amen God always makes a way he makes a way now I want to turn if you have your Bible take your Bibles and turn to first Samuel 30. we're going to read and we're going to see what else David did and this was so striking when I read this but David was running from Saul Chapter 30 verse 1 and he had back he had been on the run so long that he even sided up with the Philistines for a little while things got so bad and it came to pass when David and his men were come to ziklag see David wanted to go fight but they wouldn't let him they're like well we're afraid if you get in the battle with us then you might turn around and and uh and uh attack our rear so they wouldn't let David come with them they they locked him and all but they didn't trust him came to pass when David and his men were come to zip lag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the South and zeklag had smitten and burned it with fire now this is where he was holed up he went back to ziklag with a contingent of the Philistines and when he went when he got there the amalekites that came so the Philistines went out to fight Saul and while they were gone the amalekites came in to attack one of their cities and had taken the women captives that were therein they slew not any neither great or small but carry them away and went on their way wow could you imagine coming home and somebody had attacked your home and it burned your house down and it kidnapped your family you know we read these scriptures and we just kind of keep on reading but it's good to sometimes just stop and think for just a minute so this enemy had come in and had kidnapped their entire families all their wives all their children their daughters their sons were going to be slaves their daughters were going to be married off to the to the enemy it was a terrible time their homes were plundered and burned and destroyed my and just one one verse there and had taken the women captives and were therein they slew not in any either great or small but carry them away and went on their way so David and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire now the whole city was burned and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taking captives to be trafficked no doubt then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep wow that was some crying they squawed and they squalled and they had and they squatted and had more tears left and Ken just was grieving anybody ever had that much grief in your life amen you just didn't feel like you could get one more SOB out I've been there that's where David was didn't have no more power to weep and David's two wives were taken captives a hint on him the jezraelitis and Abigail the wife of nabel the Carmelite she was really something now and David was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but David this is the part that got me if that was today's situation a lot of times I know it says that David he went and bought some marijuana down at the Circle K it doesn't say that does it he went and got another prescription of Prozac everything was going so bad he had to find some relief somewhere he went down and he bought some Budweiser he went to the the Red Dot and bought him some liquor just to drown all of his sorrows huh it's not what it says it says that David encouraged himself in the Lord he is God I tell you right now we need to encourage ourselves and the Lord our God we need to lay down all the little besetting things that attack us day by day you know you can be addicted to gambling they got a hotline I have no idea how you get addicted to gambling but you can you can get addicted to all kinds of drugs pain medication alcohol pornography all these things and what all these things do they have a way of soothing your mind you see the devil has a false sense of soothing your soul he'll soothe it for just a little while and no if you ever known somebody who's addicted to cigarettes wait till they can't get one and see what happens it's like being around the Devil Himself they're so ill cantankerous I grew up with a whole family full of them and they'd run out of cigarettes and and I was like world war three it was terrible and what it was it was that demon that was plaguing them and harassing them until they satisfied that thing just as soon as they did everything was all right again puffing and a dragon but that's just about the way the devil does and no matter what the vice is in your life they all have a similar outcome it will harass you and it'll plague you until you give into it and then you go and you cry and ask the Lord to forgive you and he does why because he's faithful and he's true to forgive you many times we get caught up in maybe looking at something we shouldn't look at and I know it seems like I preach on this every time I get up here but there's an unction I Can't Describe there's a need that needs that needs to be met because we all have now we want the Dynamics to come into the church but there got to be a time when the mechanics are in line if you don't have the coil wire hooked up to the coil going to the distributor cap you're not gonna get no fire if you've got corrosion on the battery terminals you're not gonna get no fire if you're and and this is an old saying you watch a motor that starts missing pretty soon it stops and you look at people in the church when they start missing pretty soon they stop you don't see them anymore well where's Brother sewing so well he he quit he quit coming for a little while he started missing a lot of times I'll start backsliding all the way to the back door where they used to sit up at the front you can watch them start moving back and pretty soon to keep going back going back on out the back door I've watched it and so but what the devil wants to do is he wants to keep our minds saturated and occupied and entertained and in a drunken stupor because if you ever get convinced of what's getting ready to happen then you'll get concerned and that complacency will go out the window see many times we're not convinced oh we've heard it California is going to sink they make fun of it they even wrote a country song I bought some oceanfront property in California see I'm sorry Arizona that didn't make no sense oceanfront property in Arizona what is going to be one of these days ain't they but they want to make light of it and many times it's it's it's the old thing they'll even make fun of of of living holy they'll make fun of the Rapture they'll make fun of all of these things but one day they won't be making fun all the Laughing is going to stop one of these days ain't it David thought on his ways wonder if we could think on our ways tonight but here's the thing about it Satan has a gravity okay did it ever come up you never did get that that's fine don't worry about it the message that the title of what I was going to preach on is gravity and I thought about after the service singing that song I Feel the pool my brother Tony he beat me to it so we'll just have to sing something else so the devil has a gravity that continually tries to pull you down now anything that's that's trying to pull you down there's an old saying it's already under your feet see it's trying to pull you down it's a gravity it's a force and here's the I looked up the definition of gravity and it's a force that is pulling to a greater mass so if you're out in space and there's a planet the bigger the planet the more gravity it's going to have the more massive the planet not so much size but the mass of it will pull you into it now the devil's got a lot of mass out there and he's getting bigger and he's getting bigger and the Bible says Hell hath enlarged itself and we know that the spirit of antichrist is already here is brother Matt's been preaching that Spirit of antichrist is alive and well and it's working amongst the the world it's working amongst the church you see we have a three exoduses the first Exodus was uh Israelite of Egypt the second one was was the church out of Judaism but the third one is the bride being called out of denominationalism and see that's where that's where the rubber meets the road a lot of times that those spirits of denominationalism are still amongst the bride amongst this message not the bride but amongst this message churches but the complacency have you ever seen the uh that that gravity that I'm talking about so the gravity pulls the the river down stream and it's as it's pulling the water Downstream and many times we get tired and we're floating along we've been rolling and sometimes we just let we get complacent I've started drifting before I've just kicked back I've pulled the oars in and you just start drifting along anybody else ever done that I'm just talking to you tonight and I started drifting along but you can be sure that as long as as sure as I'm standing here as you're drifting down that River there's a waterfall down there somewhere there's destruction waiting for you somewhere now the things in our life that we have to overcome there are things that we must do to overcome of course the Lord like I said a minute ago when we do things and we're sorry for it the Lord will always forgive us of it always then don't beat yourself up about it you just get if you get knocked down get right back up again dust yourself off and say I'm still a child of God what he'll do what he loves to do is get you to fall if he can get you to fall if he can get you to to commit a little sin or commit a little mistake especially you men I'm gonna talk to your brothers for just a moment what if he gets you to to look in the wrong direction or maybe you're on your computer and something pops up and all of a sudden your mind goes to a certain thing you don't mean to do that but that's the devil putting that thing in front of you and if you don't immediately immediately right then and there stop and start praying and ask God to help you then that thing might take a hold of you see and a lot of times women maybe somebody said a little something or you get your feelings heard about something or something can happen in the church and maybe somebody said something and it'll cause a little hard feeling right then and there if you don't rebuke that thing and say I forgive him anyway I love them anyway I'm not going to let that come between me and that sister or me and that brother and hinder my walk with Christ because all that stuff hinders the church it does it has an effect on us and and if you've if you've been caught Brothers if the devil sends that thing by your way and the Bible says that that every man um uh is is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and now your own lust can draw you away but that's the word you've got to fight that thing brother Donnie was up here and he was talking about David and Goliath and you don't think that's a hard spirit in this last day am I talking to brothers or I'm just talking to the wind here it's a hard spirit in this day it's a wicked spirit it's a spirit of Jezebel in this day you say Jezebel how's it Jezebel look when Jezebel came against Elijah what was it that that was um the spirit that went out against him it was a it was a spirit but she used her her um her sex appeal to to get everybody in in Israel to wonder after those false gods she used her beauty and her influence over her husband Ahab and the very thing that when she came against Elijah and she said I'll have your head by tomorrow he ran at the threat and found himself held up in a cave what was it discouraged Lord they've all left us there's nobody else down there and God said there's seven thousand that hadn't bowed to need a bail but see that was the spirit of discouragement that went out and it anointed it went out and that that was that demon power that even affected the prophet in that day fast forward to John the Baptist he was another Elijah for they said Elias must first come but Jesus said Elias has already come and you did whatever you wanted to to him so when Elijah came again here comes Jezebel again demons don't die they don't die brother random said that's why he didn't believe in the death penalty for two reasons one capital punishment sent Jesus to the cross and two the demon don't die you just free him to get into somebody else I've never understood it conservatives I listen to conservative radio sometimes they're against abortion but yet they're for capital punishment capital murder and then on the other side the left-wingers therefore abortion and against capital punishment I'm against all of it see no man has a right to take another man's life I don't care what nobody says my so here's herodias now with the spirit of Jezebel owner you don't think she did oh yeah yeah life of the king and she what does she do she had a big party set up and she had her daughter to go out there and dance a seductive dance oh you better know it was seductive you better know it was because she got that King so tore up he said I'll give you whatever you want even up to half the kingdom and she ran back to her mommy and said what do I ask for she said the head of John the Baptist now as that Spirit was Warren against John the Baptist do you remember when he was in prison and brother Adam said that his Eagle Eye got filmed over just a little bit he wondered was Jesus really the one is he the one or not actually he was so anointed and the Holy Spirit came down and he said that's the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world but yet when he was in prison locked up he wondered what was even the one see that was that Spirit of discouragement that landed on John the Baptist and you and I fast forward another 2 000 years we had an Elijah and we're still fighting The Jezebel spirit in this day and he Wars against us in all manner of ways she does he does whatever you want to call it in this day and time it's trans it's a transgender demon I guess Jezebel I don't know what it is Hashem but what does it do what does it do it gets you it gets you into a place to where you'll listen to it for just a minute if you just stop for just a second it's already got you hold on just a minute all right all right don't worry about it I'll just read it can y'all take my word for it [Music] um but see here's the thing brother Donnie was preaching about David and Goliath and we've got a Goliath we've got the spirit of Jezebel that we're fighting in this day and it's it's it's worn against us in the in the spiritual realm and the Physical Realm in the entertainment realm in every realm that you can think of now you we now like we've been preaching brother Caleb's been preaching these different Brothers have been preaching on warfare spiritual warfare Brother JD brother Matt and brother Brad all these brothers have been preaching on knowing your enemy knowing your foe brother Matt Smith knowing your Foe and we've got to understand the enemy that we're fighting against because look yes we can do this okay well I said a minute ago if you sin you go pray and ask God to forgive you sure but there's something you've got to do too because if I'm on a diet all right and I and I'm saying Lord help me to lose weight but every day I go down to McDonald's and I get me a Big Mac and then when I'm done I'm satisfied and I'm full and I'm crying oh Lord I've done it again I'm sorry Lord help me one more time pick me up don't don't let them calories count against Me Lord hauling fat grams and then I had to have the apple pie and all that see the Lord will forgive you for it but until you make them a step in the right direction see you can keep praying and keep praying but there's something you got to do just like when Goliath was standing out there God could have just snapped his finger and his heart would have stopped and then the battle would have been over but that wasn't how he planned it he had a little little four foot nothing Jewish boy come up and say who is this a circumcised philistine two to five the armies of the Living God see he had to do something that Little Rock wasn't going to do nothing that big old giant but whatever he had in his hand God was going to multiply it amen like a Jawbone of a mule with Samson brother Bram said one hit and it would have just shattered to pieces that was a supernatural Jawbone it had a force field around it that just took out a thousand Philistines amen I bet Samson like Bruce Lee out there like a whirlwind it's a dust cloud now I don't know what's going on I'll see arms and legs over here when I'll settle in a thousand of them laying out there how did he do it amen little man from the tribe of Dan Hallelujah little Samson oh my we need to preach on that one of these days but he stood out there see he had to do something he had to make a step and we have to do the same thing you see brother Brandon preached this on making a way he'll make a way for you if you want him to hello God always makes a way of Escape every time sickness pins you in the corner Satan pinned you down to a place after you become a Christian maybe you've been a gambler you see the cards are on the table come on John we know what's in you see when you've been tempted when something's uh maybe you're an alcoholic he says here maybe you're an alcoholic or drunkard see Satan is there to tempt you but God in every time will make a way of Escape if you'll just accept it maybe you've been a drunkard and the glass is under your nose see now come on John now you want to head to that you now you if you if you want to heed to that voice you'll go right straight out to your wallow again see see where oh maybe it's well okay getting close there hey number 86 if you found it there it is yeah number 86 and then on down uh now I'm down to 80 and 89 but God see you're heading right on out to your Waller again oh my God brothers and sisters I ain't gonna stand up here and tell you that I'm holier than thou I'm just one beggar trying to tell another beggar where I found bread tonight because I'm just one bum on the corner trying to tell you where I found some change all right one panhandler to another because that's all we are amen but we've been made more we've made Kings and high priests we don't have to live like that anymore but I fell so many times how could I get up here and tell you about a testimony without a test I've had tests and I fell flat on my face Time and Time and Time and Time Again and I'll do it again I'm sure but I thank God for his grace tonight it's all sufficient Grace look I believe in holiness but I know a lot of times we've been in churches to where they substitute legalism for holiness anybody ever been around something like that Holiness is something that you live it ain't something you impose on somebody else you see that's when it becomes legalism what did you see did you see what she had on my goodness do you see what he you see his hair how long it was did you my good you know what I'm saying how about we clean up our own back door I guarantee you if you me and everybody else spend as much time worrying about us and him we wouldn't have time to see everybody else um that's what I want we need to get that love amongst us obey the word push play and obey we need to listen to those tapes we need to hear that voice say man you need to know what the prophet said we don't need to be carried or carried about by every win of Doctrine we grew up many times me and my wife were talking about this maybe many of you haven't I'm just talking from my experience of being around a certain Doctrine and when you go to church you're listening for that Doctrine good or bad you're listening if they gonna say something bad about them I ain't going back over there and if you listen if they say something well hey he's right down my alley right instead of listening to what maybe the holy spirit's saying to you you're just listening to see if they're going to preach on your pet Doctrine or not yeah well I'ma tell you right now I've got a Doctrine and that's Jesus Christ no law but love no Creed but Christ and no book but the Bible and we believe this message I believe it is absolutely a perfect message it don't I don't mean my scrutiny it's already been Vindicated by uh absolute Old Testament class prophet of the caliber of Moses of the caliber of Elijah they don't need my little uh blog spot on the Facebook or the internet giving my two cents about it but I'm going to tell you right now if I don't never preach again I'm going to tell you that if it's my last message I want my last message to say this is a perfect message I don't care who says what now if you want to go out and sin and the devil's gravity is pulling all of us all right many times some of us want to go on out there but we want to try to find a fault in this message to excuse it to ease our conscience about leaving church well they may he made a mistake or that really that cloud wasn't really taken out there or whatever kind of nonsense hogwash that they've come up with but I don't need scientific proof to believe the Red Sea parted I don't need scientific proof to know the pillar of fire came down on Mount Sinai and the whole mountain rumbled and it was on a smoke and the people cried and trembled and said oh don't let God speak to us no more but Moses you speak to us I don't need scientific proof to know that water came from a rock this is my proof right here I believe God's word that's enough for me since when did the people of God rely on government documents and scientific proof we need to believe his word and get it out of your mind if you're not convinced that he was the seventh Church AIDS messenger I don't know what else it'll take to convince you he was the messenger for this day he was absolutely thoroughly completely Vindicated Beyond any doubt Beyond any scrutiny as brother JD said there was no absolutely no um question of whether or not the supernatural was taking place in the meetings the question was when the Pharisees saw it they said it was of the devil and there were plenty Pharisees there but when the true bride saw it they said that's nothing but Jesus Christ we say the same thing tonight this message is a supernatural message oh it's so Supernatural the whole nation of Israel was Supernatural they came from a dead man basically he was as good as dead 100 years old reproductive organs gone wife couldn't nurse if she wanted to miraculous Israel so was his message we were listening to it with my daughter a couple years ago we listened to how the angel came to me oh my brother just went all over me I was sitting there listening to How brother Bram said he was there and he was just he said how foolish could it somebody be he was praying for God to take that thing away from those chances those visions and he said he was in that cabin there in that hunting cabin and he said a little light showed and he saw a man he heard footsteps way out in the dark in the woods that'd scare me to death wouldn't scare you scared him and he heard footsteps come walking up and he saw a barefoot in that light he looked up and he saw a man about six foot tall all of complexion brother Billy Paul said when he saw him he said if you could look if you could if if they were of a race they looked like the Armenian people is what he said Armenian kind of in between Middle Eastern and kind of like that oh my these words that he told him could you and I could just hear it brother I could hear it when he said it the angel said fear not for I'm sent from the presence of almighty God oh my what you need brother rap said Moses you showed that sign one time and they never had to do it again but brother Branham had to do it again and again and again and again and again still they didn't believe but more blessed are them that have not seen and believe amen I believe you believe tonight oh my God I believe it Hallelujah now so the church is going to have trouble we have hard feelings unforgiveness and all these things that's the gravity of the devil I already said about the all right so here's the weapon I wrote down had enough time to write down a few notes brother Matt but brother Donnie said this and this got me he said he said that when when he's knocked down Goliath with that stone brother Branham said it flew A Thousand Miles a second that's fast I did the math on it it comes up to Mach 4000. you know what that is mocks of Speed and Sound 4 000 times the speed of sound three million six hundred thousand miles an hour that's what it comes up to hey John didn't have a chance I don't care how little David was little as much when God is in it oh my you believe that little is much when God is in it but he said that he jumped up on that giant and he took the sword that he intended to slay David with the very weapon that he was going to kill him David took it out of his sheath and chopped that devil Giant's head off how many of he's got a Goliath in your life maybe a sickness maybe a besetting sin maybe a little something is a Glide there's a mountain that's always there but let me tell you something he said take the very weapon now here's the weapon the devil really don't have a weapon you've got a weapon you've got faith there ain't no greater weapon than that see you've got faith and you've got the word of God okay now here's what happens how do you take the Devil's weapon and use it against him now talking about this in the men's prayer meeting so they got to jump on you but at cage I was going down the road I said Lord how can I take the Devil's weapon how can I take his weapon how can I take the weapon how can I and I got to think of what is this Weapon It's doubt it's unbelief his weapon is to get you to doubt your weapon that's all his weapon is is to get you to discredit what you've got it's to get you to discredit and how does he do that through a thought the greatest battle ever fought was in the mind it began in the mind so wait a minute I'm not going to wait until I've already got you know I'm down on my back no you ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure we just read that with the kids last night Jesus was talking about that see he said if you're walking with somebody try to make peace with him then he said or not they're going to throw you in jail take you to the judge then the officer is going to deliver you so he's like then you're gonna pay everything to get out so my kids like what does that mean daddy he's like don't make a mountain out of a molehill and take care of things while they're little before it gets out of hand and it gets too big to deal with now that might not be your interpretation that was mine and the kids enjoyed it so I said well praise God they learned something but see don't let the little things get big things when a little thought comes in your mind what do you do you maybe you start entertaining it you start thinking about things and all of a sudden before you know he doesn't zone out going out oh no here's how you take his weapon me and the devil's prayer Partners now and he don't even know it I bet he's fuming mad screw loose or or peg leg or whatever his name is his Downer he's probably getting he's probably getting the third degree from the devil because he doesn't turn something loose inside of me because now every time he sends a thought my way it's my time to pray that's my weapon that's my I say thank you devil for reminding me to pray today thank you devil for reminding me to go to God thank you devil oh my let me tell you take that weapon he's trying to use against you and turn it right back around on him um stop that thing before it gets starts taking root because if it if it gets implanted you know it'll start growing and you got a lot of problems then it gets real big and then you got more problems just cut it off stop that thing now don't that sound easy Brothers it is easy and you got a good prayer life to boot and the devil's just over scratching his head but what do I do with him now I want to get to a place where the devil don't know what to do with me [Applause] that's where I want to be I want to get so deep in the Holy Ghost he can't even find me oh my I want this whole church to get so deep and the Holy Ghost the devil he'll be looking I've looked here I don't know where he's at Lucifer where I don't know where he's at either I don't know he's a he's hit he's hiding he's hiding in the cleft of the rock that's where he's at that dog on how to Shell that Matt Watkins he found the cleft in that rock I tried to keep him away from it but he found it anyway glory be to God hallelujah tonight oh wow find that cleft in the rock Hallelujah take that weapon and use it against the devil this is what brother Branham said here oh my he said now if you want to heed to that voice you'll go right straight out to the wallow again bring it back up there if you can brother 89 but God is always there do this turn your mind towards heaven this now he's talking about when he comes in when the trip when The Temptations come when the Trials come when the lust comes when the temptation to drink the temptation to get upset the temptation to get depressed the temptation to think that you're worthless the temptation to think that you're not pretty or that you got low self-esteem and nobody likes you and all these temptations that the devil is going to bring against you talking to somebody in here tonight just turn your mind towards heaven and look towards Calvary that this is what the prophet said Do you believe him say blessed Holy Spirit come to me I'm in need and he said watch what takes place God Will Make A Way of Escape every time for he will God will always do it or you always did it he'll do it but we've got to run to him we've got to run back to him just as hard as we can go oh my you believe it try not to hold you I gotta one more here now we want to talk about just a moment about that gravity of that Force John 12 and 32 turned there for just a second and I want to read you might some of you may know it already John 12 and 32 and we'll see what Jesus said y'all forgive me for getting too tore up please forgive me come on I just thought about unforgiveness brother oh my Sister Sarah up here that Sunday I told her I said I didn't have enough room for you to sing up here sister she was but bouncing up against them drum sets in the microphones and everything else I said Hallelujah Lord part let it pour on all of us like that I will tell you right now if you shout and you scream and you holler you don't make me nervous one bit not a oh no what makes me nervous is when you don't say nothing sitting there looking at me like brother Brown said a frog eating Buckshot or something well if it makes you mad at least it's making you think because I'm gonna tell you right now some of the greatest Revelations I've ever had it was after I got mad about it because you know what it upset my little apple car it upset my way of thinking I had it all figured out um I'll stay on the brother the other day I said about 20 years ago the distance between what I knew and what I thought I knew was about like from here to L.A that was a big difference but I'm glad that God's merciful and he's patient he's patient oh my God and Jesus said talk about gravity and if I be lifted up from the earth we'll draw all men unto me oh my gravity what is that that's a mass grader now see what's greater in your life are the pleasures of the world are the sins of the world is that what you really hunger for that ain't what you hunger for in here tonight is that what you really want is that the greatest thing that's going to draw you that way if you want a good time you want the party you want the lies that the devil tells you see he'll show you the Budweiser commercials and then I'm up there just getting down and having fun but he don't show you the cirrhosis of the liver he don't show you the date rape he don't show you the car crash into the tree see he shows you all the good times he shows you all these good things but he don't show you the outcome of going down that road oh yeah it feels good to get to get a little high I want to get a little high in here tonight too but I don't need no fermented yeast malt barley grapes or nothing else how old the new wine I was the Holy Spirit Wine um man we need some new bottles in here too don't we new wine and new bottles will be all right it ain't drunk as you suppose but this is that that was prophesied by Joel hey man this is that said I'll be lifted up I'll draw a man unto me this is what brother bran said he said but let's watch I'm gonna close here in just a few minutes but let's watch him as he stands there this is Jesus talk about gravitation now gravitational pull oh my I want that gravitational pull to go in a different direction you know they say the magnetic field changed in the earth it actually has a scientific proof it used to go sideways now it goes up and down they've proven it I could go into all the details but I don't want to bore you but gravitation loses its power see now watch as this is after he rose from the dead he appeared to the disciples he was seen right here of about 500 people at this moment they had it going away Gathering 500 people saw him he said there's a light beneath his feet he starts seeing daylight between his feet and the ground he rises higher and higher higher and higher gravitation lost its power just as death lost its power he was the center of gravitation oh my God he was the creator of gravitation he held gravitation at his own command as he held death at his own command let me tell you something brothers and sisters we've got to overcome the world in here before we can overcome the world out here we've got to overcome the Enemy Within before we can ever face the enemy out there we've gotten to fight we've got to we've got to press on we've got to press on we've got to overcome it's not a maybe it's not a hope so we must overcome in this day don't give up because there's a there's a gravity force that I'm pointing to now see I was pulled the other way but I was getting pulled down that waterfall it was a grave situation see gravity just keeps pulling you down it'll pull you down you get old your skin starts sagging pretty soon it pulls you right on down into the grave into the ground and then if you're you don't have anything that's anti-gravity anti-satian gravity see I believe in gravity but if you don't have anything that's anti then you're gonna keep going down and down and brother random he got shot when he was about 14 or 15 years old he was dying fail and he fell and he fell and he said I just kept falling and I kept falling and I kept falling being pulled towards the center of gravity of the of Satan himself but then he said oh God he said there wasn't no God there wasn't no mama there there wasn't no papa there he said if you just let me go back I'll be a good boy he said the only thing I could think of I never did commit adultery or fornicate I never did do that that's the only thing he could think of you think about that how that God well I know we all had trials but he had a prophet in this day who said don't ever drink and he let him be born into a family of bootleggers he said don't ever smoke and every one of them smoked and chewed and everything else don't don't run around and defile your body with women and he said there was girls up there getting liquor and stuff that was with men my age now and he was in his 50s when he said that young girls and he was brought up in that in that in that life but oh God he was an overcomer but he said I would have done all those things but it was God's grace that kept me but he said God if you let me go back I'll be good he said he started coming up and he get lighter and lighter and lighter and you know what he started his journey ain't getting on going amen he stopped down here for a few years and he worked and he labored and he did all he could for the kingdom of God and then one day on amarillo Highway he got his ticket home and then he went up and then he kept going up amen one of these days we're going to see him again we're going to see him again he's going to come back you say you're believing in return absolutely Paul is going to return irenius is going to return Colombia is going to return all these brothers Wesley Luther oh yeah they're going to return for we wish are alive and remain we ain't gonna We're Not Gonna hinder those asleep Paul do a secret we're not going to hinder them the dead in Christ are going to rise first oh what a day that's going to be think about it

US and that means a lot to me I can't remember all these requests I I have no way but God knows each one of them and I tell you what if they have enough confidence to believe that we can approach the throne and we can get a hold of that line for them we ought to do everything we can tonight to try to remember each one if we can and just ask God to meet each one of these needs let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father lord god Jehovah Jireh God you see to all these things yours Jehovah Rapha God you heal all of our diseases and Lord tonight God as we have ministered and we fellowship and we've

the Healer of all of these diseases father we know that by your stripes we were healed and God we know that with each stripe God each one was written down lord each stripe that you took upon your back lord one was for diabetes one was for heart disease one was for cancer I don't care if it's stage four I don't care what the disease is Lord you even raised a man from the dead he'd been dead for four days God there's nothing that's impossible with you and God was just reaching out by Faith Lord and we're taking hold of that line Lord we've got a hold of that Lifeline tonight Lord knowing by Faith Lord we've set our wings and we know dear God the holy spirit is here to answer all of our needs and our requests God you said who who what man would give his child a stone if he asked him for a piece

would not let him leave this earth Lord in that condition God we just Reach Out Lord by faith and just claiming for thee o God and for thy kingdom God may he Lord in somehow some way Lord maybe he already accepted you Lord we just pray that Lord I stood at a deathbed of a woman and she had done gone beyond her speech and I asked her I said to you accept the Lord Jesus and Lord you know that she's I said if you if you do just blink your eyes all she could do Lord was blink her eyes and God I believe that by that confession Lord and by that faith in you dear God that I'll see her again one

love you and we thank you we commit this service into thy hands Lord in Jesus name amen amen we still got a little bit of times anybody gotta testimony all right I just want to give a praise um the Lord put upon my wife's heart several weeks ago to pray for a prayer cloth over my brother-in-law Ray Reddington and she didn't really even know why but she did and she took it home and then she struggled over what to write in the card and she she finally sent it while unbeknownst to us he ended up in the hospital and um I called my sister and I said hey there's something in the mailbox for Ray I'm getting ready to go to the hospital I said would you please go get it before you go to the hospital and so she went outside and got it and it brought tears to his eyes when he read the card and he saw the prayer cloth and he knew the scripture and about a week later he had to go get a heart ablation and if they would have given him that heart ablation he would have died he had stenosis in the heart they did a test and they told him guaranteed there's no way you would have made it through this and so he made the doctor let him stay in the hospital and four days later he got a new valve replacement and he's already back home so God is good he cares and I'm just so thankful for it and then I got a I got another parade report uh we've been we had another doctor's appointment yesterday and it you know their doctors are just so uncertain but the next doctor's appointment we have is about a month from today and I am certain that that it's a work that's already been done and we we actually got better news than we've been getting yesterday and so I'm thankful for that report in one month that it's already done foreign a couple of weeks ago I was helping sister Brenda with a project at her house we were trying to unfold a table and pull the table leg out and the table legs were meant to extend as far as you needed them extend or go in as far as you needed them go in Table leg got stuck and I was pulling and pulling on it it wouldn't come loose and I thought well I'm gonna get this out so I yanked on it as hard as I could and when I did it popped completely out popped me in my left eye I mean hard when I tell you I was in pain I couldn't even hardly breathe it hurt so bad sister Brenda immediately grabbed me and she started praying and I knew when she started praying I was like that's not her praying that's God and we went in the living room and she gave me an ice pack Pride come to the house and he prayed and when I first opened my eye I could not see anything out of the left side of my left eye it was totally black and the middle the right side of my eye it looked like when you're a little kid you're playing like your cross side it looked like that it was just I couldn't see nothing out of my eye and we kept praying and praying kept that ice pack on there and when Brad came and prayed and he left to go get me a little eye patch to put on it because the light was hurting my eyes so bad but within about 20 minutes the Blackness went away on the one side of my eye but it was still very blurry and I couldn't still see very well but within a couple of hours the the I started dilating like it was supposed to all the blurriness pretty much went away by that night I went to bed got up the next morning there was barely a bruise on my eye it was barely puffy at all and I had a small little red spot in the bottom of it and by the end of the week it was pretty much everything was gone it was like nothing had ever even happened and I know that was a miracle okay all right go ahead bro and Matt was like we gotta go home it's no time enough I about jumped up was like hey hey wait a minute but I figured I better behave but uh the other night um Meredith was looking at Hazel and she opened her mouth and um Meredith's like wait what was that on her tooth and she looked she's like here get a light and so we got a light and we looked at it and there was behind one of her front teeth it was all black we thought well what is that is that a cavity or is that something on her tooth and she brushed her tooth and it was still black and we were like so she must have a cavity on her front tooth there you know and uh of course Meredith is in the medical field and she looks it up you know she's looking at it and she's like you know that could ruin her smile you know they'd have to work on that tooth it could mess up her teeth and ruin her smile and you know all that fear just starts what if and you know what if and I I was sitting there and you could just feel that just coming down oh my what are we gonna do we're gonna make an appointment and something just came over me and I said no sir I said Satan you're a liar shut up I was like we're not accepting that she's not gonna have that where she's well from now on WE that's what we're gonna testify is like if you gotta take her to the appointment fine whatever but we're not accepting that couple days later guess what it's gone praise the Lord [Applause] it's a little bit different I know we've already prayed and we've and we've prayed for brother Jason I'm sorry okay you got one I just want to say this before I give this to you so I want to I want to say this let's all say together thank you Lord because it's already done thank you Lord for healing brother Jason let's say so I'll say it together thank you Lord for healing brother Jason and now let's give him thanks for healing the baby of brother Caleb's sister Joy thank you Lord because it's already done it's a done deal we've already prayed we've given to him it's all it's already done amen so that night that we had gathered around and people the Lord was laying it upon people's hearts to have prayer cloths prayed over the Lord unction my heart to have a prayer cloth for my son and I got that sent in the mail to him and I didn't tell him nothing I waited I just wrote him a handwritten letter to tell him how that the Lord brought that about so he would understand that this was something that the Lord is giving him and I um and so anyway he read it and after that he called me several hours later and he said Mom I got that prayer cloth he said when I put that in my pocket he slid I slipped it down into my pocket and he said I felt the Holy Spirit I just thought I felt the Lord just move through my entire body and I was just like so excited because I knew that the Lord had spoke to me and you know it was that something that I had to go and get that and to think that I if I had ever pushed that down just because you hate walking in front of people at least I do and that was the gift for him and he had not been able to get any time with his daughter and he's been struggling with that he wants his time with his daughter so bad and she had been the mother had been unwilling to do anything for him like to give him anything hardly at all and that very day a couple of hours later after he got the prayer cloth he got a phone call he got the mother started negotiating so now he's not only got more days added to when he gets to spend time with his daughter he has overnights with her she spends the night two nights in a row he's just getting more and more and it's just been amazing and he told me he said Mom this happened after I got the prayer cloth so he was already given God the thanks and the you know the reason for all this even happening he was testifying to the fact that it this is working and so I was so excited and I know that personally I gotta say this I believe that God has way more in store for him than just that that was just the beginning yeah [Applause] it was anybody else we got time for one more anybody good all Hearts clicked all right let's let's just pray one more time and then we'll dismiss we'll let brother Gideon scene Heavenly Father Lord we just don't hardly want to go Lord we're so thankful that you came to visit us tonight and so thankful Lord that we were able to gather Lord with your the purchased Lord Of Your Precious Blood Lord we thank you for these testimonies that we've heard tonight just just a confirmation Lord that you are

just commit these other requests to you father for your safekeeping Lord and we certainly know Lord that you'll you'll see to everything Lord and God we just ask that you would just be with those that have to travel a long way tonight keep them safe on the highway Lord let no harm come to them God we know there's different ones that have to travel an hour or more hour and a half Lord largest watch over them send your angels before him to your father and God we pray for the prayer meeting tomorrow night dear God I pray that each brother that has a way to get away can come and Lord and be here
