tonight amen certainly glad to be here in this house Amen to be here on a Wednesday night I'm going to um send the booth my PowerPoint uh sister Esther if you could just uh be ready for that um going to send that to you right on time my PowerPoints usually come right when I'm walking out and so um the the devil really was fighting us just right before service and uh just trying to get my notes and prepped and then had to uh and I was what I'm going to be speaking on tonight I really felt impressed to have a lot of it up here on the slide so that you could read these things with me and uh right as I was just getting them prepared just uh the devil threw the kitchen sink at us and so uh but we got the victory amen and and those online can have sound and so we're thankful for that but it really just threw a wrench and uh my preparation I asked but the Tony could have give me just a couple extra minutes and so um so we just we believe the Lord has all things in control amen we're calm we're collected we're relaxed because we got the Lord on our side amen and that's the only reason we're here tonight amen it's because the Lord was on our side Joshua chapter 2 let's just begin reading very familiar script scripture here and I'm just going to read just um one just one verse here from verse 12 this is Rahab now therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token Lord Jesus we give you thanks for the reading of your word tonight believing Lord God that you control all things Lord God and that nothing's out of cater Lord nothing's out of step nothing's Out of Time Lord everything's fall into the Rhythm Of Your Divine Providence we believe that Lord with all of our heart God you've seen us Lord here you've seen the struggles that each individual Lord that's standing here tonight you knew every struggle they would go through Lord to to get them here in your house tonight Lord and father I believe that you've given us a word Lord that could come and minister to your children's Heart Lord may it bring encouragement may it bring refreshment Lord Lord if it if we need Revival then we just raise our hands and say send Revival Lord God I pray to every person that's here tonight Lord any of those that would listen by way of archive Lord or those that'll be streaming here tonight may you just add your blessing to it now we give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen you can be seated amen I'm going to minister to you tonight and I really don't uh I'm I'm just going to take tonight as more of a teaching session and uh we say that all the time minute doesn't really always go that way but we'll uh try to teach some of these things and so I believe teaching is important and so understanding some of these some things sometimes it's good to take a Wednesday night and be able just to cover some very basic things and uh one of those things that uh I believe is an important truth that was restored very vital to us in this end time in the age that we live in and that is the token amen amen the token would be a very important uh Revelation and very important subject and so we just have a lot we want to say on it tonight and I have some of these on the slides and some of them I don't and that's okay uh we just trust the Lord that what we did get up there is just fine and the Lord knows knows best we we have this uh subject of the token and I've read it out of Joshua chapter 2 and I'm not just preaching on the token preaching on the Supreme token and you you you that study the message will be familiar with that statement brother Brandon makes that we've received a supernatural Supreme token and so that quote I don't I have it at the very last slide um sister Esther if you could um I'll just I'll control it here actually I'll control it here so that we can just read it and follow it together so we know all of these things uh taught by the message um of what the true token was and and and Rahab we know asked this question to the spies and she asked for this true token she and they the Bible tells us how that they you know that God had said he would pass through Egypt and and that he would uh execute judgment and all of the firstborn uh would die and God says but the blood shall be for a token upon the house where you where you are when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt I love how brother Bram says this in the message the token and he says to the world it's a bunch of foolishness but to God it's the only way the only thing he requires is that token it must be there you cannot have the token until the fair is paid then you are a possessor of the token which gives you the privilege of a free pass if I see the blood I'll pass over you what a time what a privilege to know that you pack with within you the past what a statement when I see the blood I'll pass over you it's the only thing that he'll recognize it's nothing else that can take its place I brought something very special for y'all tonight and you're all going to love me a lot better even you people that are not Apple lovers will love this brother Mark he's not here but I got a little button on my Apple watch that I added and it's a 1eh hour timer and I'm going to click it right now and when it goes off I'm going to stop Fair agreement now don't now I want you to hold me to my word amen so let me just go for one hour amen from now and uh and so we'll just keep going sorry for that Interruption but I wanted to make sure I remembered that brother bham says it's the only thing he'll recognize it's nothing else that can take its place no substitute listen no substitute no denomination no nothing else it takes that God said that will I see so he's looking for something right he's looking for a token notice there was no substitute to it there was no other way there was nothing that would no matter how great or splendous uh you know uh no matter how great you would think it could be brother bam says God would take no substitute no matter how holy the person was on the outside no matter how perfect their walk was on the outside if they didn't have the token it really meant nothing amen right so holiness is good we thank God for Holiness we believe that we serve a holy God but let me say it this way Holiness won't get you in the Rapture talking about the outward Holiness the Bible says Be You adorned with the inward beauty of the Lord that's what David said it was the inward Holiness that really matters can you say Amen tonight so it had to be the token it was something that was visible that's why the Bible made it the the spies said it needs to be a Scarlet cord that was spoke of many things we could say on that but it represented the blood it was visible and it was it was something that was going to be a cord which the would the same spies would escape from it was we could say the means of Salvation this is what they gave Rahab when she said give me a true token so they gave her something that was visible come on somebody we're talking about we're talking about a true token a supreme token that we've received God didn't give us a dress code I'm thankful for a dress code but the dress code ain't the token I'm thankful for holy living I'm thankful for a home that I I've taken the trash out but listen that's not the token right I'm thankful for the blood of Christ but that's not the token the life that was in the blood is the token you can brother bam said I can have a vial of the literal blood of Jesus Christ that wouldn't do anybody any good but the life of the of the sacrifice would come back on the believer and that would make it the token that's what God was looking for so it was a means of Salvation you know what else I love about this token is it wasn't just for Rahab but it was for her whole family the token that God gives you in this day the Supreme token isn't just for you it's for your whole family a father can apply it a mother can apply it and it's for all of the children it's for the whole family so it was it was it was for the entire family when Jericho was destroyed Joshua said go into the harlot's house and bring her out and and and all the Bible says it this way and all that belong to her in accordance with your oath that you gave to her so Rahab we know this and I'm I I just want to spend just a minute on this because we got a lot to get to but a Rahab we know would be a type of a woman who was a complete alien she was she was from not only that she was a Canaanite meaning that she was from a cursed race she she lived from a cursed people she had no Heritage she had no lineage she didn't it didn't matter it didn't matter let me say it this way in this day it doesn't matter what your history is doesn't matter what family you came from doesn't matter what your past said because it was going to be faith that adopted her into the family of God and so listen Hebrews would list the most notable people in the Bible yet it puts this little woman Rahab the Harlot right with the heroes of the faith right in the midle middle of a bunch of renowned great Heroes like Abraham and and all of these great Heroes of Faith yet God inserts right in the company of this great people God inserts this little woman named Rahab who's known in the Bible back then as a harlot let me tell you what she's not known as Rahab the Harlot anymore Hallelujah so so you say brother Matt what's the point my point is is that God is no respector of persons we know that so you know what that what else else that means is that God doesn't see anything he doesn't see your last name he doesn't see your past he doesn't see where you came from he sees one thing Faith which is a revelation so she was a Canaanite this this by Nature meant that she was an alien from the Commonwealth she was from a cursed people a people that God said wipe out destroy them don't keep any of them so she was part of that Wild Olive Tree the Bible speaks of in the new test of that family that was grafted into the family of God what was it going to be it was going to be my representation it was going to be your representation that God could takeen nobody from nowhere with no name with no nothing of themselves that they could give yet God could save could take a seat of faith and place it inside of you and God would recognize that Faith oh friends what Grace what Amazing Grace she belonged to a heathen she was abandoned at as a harlot my goodness she was abandoned as a harlot listen friends this was her own choice I'm not preaching to you some woman that you know Misfortune and came to but this was her own choice it was it was it was but what was God doing God was singling out one person who was the most unworthy to receive Grace so that you can look at yourself and say I might be the most unworthy I might be unworthy un deserving but God by Grace by Amazing Grace oh sin did abound but how much more grace did abound in my testimony he singled her out it showed that by her own choice she was given up to the most viest life you could think of for a woman let me say it this way it was her own choice that that that made her a harlot but it was divine choice that made her a predestinated seed it was your human choice that brought you to sin but God made a Divine choice that overrode your choice it over Road your path you took in life and God said divine grace is going to come over and rewrite This Woman's life can you identify with that here tonight and so this is this was she was the most unlikely candidate a name that it should have been scrubbed out in judgment and destruction there was no sabbaths observed in Jericho there was no evangelist there was no preachers there was no there was she didn't have a chance there was no scripture reading even the Torah wasn't read in Jericho she didn't have a chance uh there was there was no Prophet sounding forth any message of warning uh if anybody should have never made it oh I could say if anybody should have never made it how many can say that with me if anybody never had a chance I didn't have a chance if anybody wasn't going to make it it would have been a would have been little sister Rahab amen how did the spies even think of how the spies even just so happened they came into this woman's house out of all the people in Jericho they came to one little woman you say why brother Matt because there was a predestinated seed before she ever made her first wrong choice God already made a Divine Choice oh Hallelujah even even these men how they located this woman will you brother Bron preaches a message one in a million so God literally LED these women to her house she couldn't get to God so God came to her the Bible says it this way the Lord knoweth them that are his Hallelujah and so so the Bible gives this you know this entire uh story here of Rahab and we just want to pause from that just for a moment I just want to bring a point that it was rahab's faith in the god that she heard about that saved her I said it was rahab's faith in a God she was told about another words she was of the kind or the type of person that didn't need a scientific explanation she didn't need some indoctrination she didn't need some human intellectual reasoning to rationalize it out but she heard about a living God and she believed in that Living God whom she heard about never had seen Jesus said blessed are you that have not seen and yet still believe friends do you realize tonight you have a seed gen of God down inside of you because you believe in a God that you've heard about Hallelujah that was the difference between Rahab and everyone else she wasn't where she should have been in life she wasn't doing what she should have been in life she was doing everything but searching for the Lord amen yet the Bible says she heard about a God and believed in that God so God gives her a token it's an identification it's something for I want to get these principles to you I know they're very simple but the token is something for you to see and something for God to see I said the token that God gives you is something for you to see and it was something for God to see so when God gives us the Holy Ghost it's something that God sees and death passes over and it's something we see as a transformation that comes to our heart it's work the Bible says that works is Faith expressed it's something for God to see listen brother bam says this is the evening time the age that we live in this is the evening time for the church this is the evening time this is the token in 1963 brother Brandon preaches this is the evening time for my Ministry this this is the evening time for my message I'm dying I'm going I'm moving out in the evening brother random says I'm dying I'm going I'm moving out in the evening time of the gospel and we've come through justification through sanctification and so forth but this is the time that the token has to be applied amen oh friends that that just feels like lightning bolts going through my body this is the time that the token must be applied this is the hour where the token must be on display you say brother Matt what is the token it is the literal Life of Christ it is the personal revelation to you Christ to you personally it is the Dynamics coming upon the mechanics it is come on somebody help me preach it is the wheat seed it is the Omega that was the alpha it is the baptism it is not a baptism it is not a gift of the Holy Ghost the token is the person of Christ himself and let me with that being said let me say this he must be on display brother bam says it must be applied I told you last Sunday i' something I want to talk to you about this is it the time that when you you can't just play with it it's got to be done if it's ever going to be done it's got to be done now we can see the Wrath is just about to ready to pass over this country we can see God's Wrath is just ready to the the cup is overflowing friends I don't know of an age ever lived in before where we could say it more true today that we're living at the coming of the Lord Jesus we're living right on the cusp of his wrath ready to be poured out we see it in the signs we see it in signs in the heaven we see signs on the earth we see signs of wars and rumors of War I I'm not preaching on that here tonight but if you ever were living with time fulfilling prophecy modern events being made clear by prophecy it's right now friend and let me say this the token must be on display he's looking for the literal life of Jesus Christ the literal life of Jesus Jesus Christ what part of him all of him which Doctrine all of his Doctrine which part of his character all of his character which part your brother Brandon brother Brandon would say oh if that if that church could only become a reflector of that first church I say God let me be a reflector of that first church let my testimony reflect the book of Acts church if there was ever an age where God's looking for the token to be on display at right now in our life I'm getting ahead of myself but I just I just want to pause so didn't you say brother Matt what is that Supreme token brother B says as the evening Shadows are appearing and the Wrath is ready to be poured out from on high from upon these ungodly Nations and upon ungodly unbelievers upon the professors without a possession upon these I've tried to unfold myself and live right among it to see where it was standing before I said these things we're living in the shadows and the Wrath is ready to strike and God is requiring a token that you yourself have received his token the Holy Ghost it's the only way and the only sign that God will ever pass because it is the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back into the believer therefore in the days of Luther and the days of Wesley in the days of Luther you had the water age in the days of Wesley you had the blood age brother bandam says but in this day now what is it going to be it's going to be not the water not the blood not not the gifts of the Spirit but actually the person himself the life of the Lamb comes back on the worshipper oh brother Brandon would say in the identified Masterpiece don't you know Abel died upon the same rock that his lamb was slain upon think about that friends Abel died on the same Rock he slay his lamb upon what was it representing to be identified with your sacrifice to be identified with Jesus Christ is to be identified with his death his barrel and his resurrection as Paul says that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering it's incredible to me how focused and I'm just hope I can say these things carefully enough to not uh say them wrong in in a way that would would cause a misunderstanding but but let me just say this it's amazing how how self-obsessed of a world we live in that is so self-obsessed with personal suffering can I just preach to you here just for a moment Paul says I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that's Romans 8:18 with the which shall be re revealed in us so so so this this is this is so opposite of the world that you live in a world that is so enamored and and and and as I said so taken in with inward inward everything's about you everything's about me everything's about what I've went through what I've suffered all the bruises I have all the things and all the troubles in my life don't you realize that's a spirit that was prophesied upon this generation that men would become lovers of their own self do you know that you can be a lover of your own self when you take a pity party about all the things that you've went through and all of the people that's treated you wrong and all the people that's offended you and all the people and that you say brother Matt well they really did I have no doubt they really did but listen friends God never asked you to be in the fellowship of your own sufferings he asked you to be in the fellowship of his sufferings and we live in a world that is self so so so intoxicated with self hope I could say that correctly spending so much spiritual energy on pain and hurts listen I I I believe in pain pain we preached on it broken but not bitter I pre I preached that here and I believe in 100% God wants to use the bruise that came in your life but if we're not careful friends we can become so self indulged in our own suffering that we forget this life isn't about our life and about all that we went through Paul said that I may know him in the fellowship of his sufferings Paul went through as much that just Jesus did as a human outside of the suffering you could even say is the beheading there there would be very few things that Paul didn't go through was Shipwrecked and beaten and stoned but but he never he never was he never boasted he it was never about Paul it was never about what he went through do you realize how quickly we can make our Christian Life about what what we've went through I know that's so backwards from maybe I hope I hope you don't misunderstand me I hope you know my heart but we can become so focused even the modern church today you read their books and books and books and books that have been New York Times bestsellers from Christian authors talking about hurt and pain and how other people hurt you and how to overcome the pains and hurts that you've received in your life life and I believe in all of that but do you realize friends if you're not careful you take that and you take a spirit of self-love when it was never God God is not at God is not here to put Band-Aids on everything that you've ever went through and just me this life is not about a perfect life and a perfect Eden with no pain and no hurt and no trouble hello somebody there's n numerous with so much compassion upon about the hurt of the of the suffering of humanity and I believe in all of it but if we're not careful we enter into the fellowship of our brother's suffering and we never enter into the fellowship of Christ suffering if you want to reign with him you've got to suffer with him brother brandham says he clearly shows that those who will reign with him must come the same way he came amen you think Jesus didn't have a right to be offended it's true when one member suffers the whole body suffers I believe in that I see nothing wrong with people uh G getting help for some of the things they've went through and things that their burdens that they've went in their life I believe in every single bit of that I believe it's scriptural I believe in that I you know I 100% but the problem is is that if we're not careful we become so selfishly and self centered and people can become so self-consumed by their own hurts you said booy brother Matt you took a turn we can become so self self- centered about the about our own pain and our own suffering that it's left us with little or no time to contemplate what Paul meant when he said that I may know him in the fellowship of his suffering hello notice this today and I I'm just going to pause from that maybe we'll preach on that some other time but uh but but we are preaching on that we're preaching on the Supreme token and what it means to be identified with your lamb let me let me just inject that here that do you know that the the things when you can go through your pain and your suffering and your torment and give Glory unto God and not make it make you bitter and and angry and callous do you know what you're doing you're being identified with your lamb who had a right to get angry but he opened not his mouth hello as we said it the L when we preach that message you you you say they hurt me they offended me and now's my chance to get back and get revenge no now's your chance to exercise true power amen so so what is this supreme token what is this token this supreme token careful now I'm I'm I'm really going to get myself into a pickle what is this supreme token brother Brandon would say this and I'm just going to fast forward down to the to the very last two slides here uh you're going to have to put that back up I went one too many my apologies but I wanted to get to the very last one let me just bring it down uh to these I want to read I actually got these a little bit out of order and that's okay I think this is it there yes now we have this is the token 1963 this is November different than the one we read from September but he says now we have a token in this day how many believe that we've been given a token which is an anti-type of that type make sure I didn't go uh I just lost it don't know what happened there you can click on the slide again yeah he says which is an anti-type of that type of that natural token we've been given the supernatural Supreme token how many loves that as much as I do all that foreshadowed had been given I love that all that that foreshadowed has been given to this generation has been given the token now we have the Holy Ghost is our token it is our identification that we have accepted the death of the Lamb Not only was Jesus just a human life to come back on us but it was God himself manifested in flesh that brought back upon us the adoption of sons that now we are Sons and Daughters of God that is the token it's our identification of the Passover it's our in identification that we have believed God and God has accepted so you notice brother Adam uses this word here that brought back God himself manifest manifested in flesh that brought back upon us the adoption of sons okay now let me start at the beginning I want to take you through some of these things that brother brandham mentions and we're just going to go through these uh uh as we feel L I may read from some more that I don't have up there and so uh but that's okay we just want to we want to just get to what the Lord wants us to and then we'll we'll close um and I've lost it here before me but that's okay so so brother bam says this uh in in the message leadership give me just one moment while I pull this up I'm gonna I'm going to need this okay thank you Lord so so there's a difference brother Brandon would make a a a a differentiation if I could say it that way he would differentiate some of these terms let me pull that back here just for a moment from where you go from him talking about the Supreme token or the supernatural token so I'm just going to take a a just a corner here just make make a turn maybe pull it down in gear from fifth gear just go a little bit slower because you're you're going to see some things that the prophet says here when he's preaching on this subject of adoption which is what we just read from when brother bam talks about adoption the adoption of sons and we know that this this phrase brother brandham could use could is one that could very easily be misunderstood let me just say something friends as I just begin here uh to speak about this you know this is just something that's so real to me the Lord has just made so real to me personally and and I don't just for not even for one minute say that I I understand everything in the message I don't there's a lot of things that I've got if you've seen my Google Docs uh Drive you'd see so so so many documents that I've put in there as questions for myself to study because there's so much that we don't understand there that me myself I don't have all the answers uh all the all of the the the the things figured out but let me say it this way I can only preach to you what God has revealed to me and youd only want me to preach what God has revealed to me but but let me just say if I say something and hear and especially to someone who would hear this you know I'm not I'm not dog I'm not going to be dogmatic about this and and and and just put a period here I'll put a comma if maybe you didn't don't see it this way then that's okay the Lord can help us both I just want to preach it as the Lord's given it to me and revealed to me and and so some of these things you may misund you may would misunderstand but I just I want to be clear on them because I look at the subject a as such a vital one to understand and that is the subject of the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and the true adoption of sons as being absolutely vital for every young person in our church every old person in our church and everybody in the middle to understand fully what it means to be an adopted son and there's so many things the messages I've I've even looked at for years now and the Lord even just just here recently Lord has just been opening things up by by Sovereign Grace I I believe the everybody could testify of that tonight the Lord shows you things that you didn't see before so thank I'm thankful for that and as brother randam says we should Above All Else pray for Revelation and so so but I I want to take from some of these things that brother bandham talks about when he talks about the adoption and the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're going to read from a quote in a minute where it talks about terminologies because you have to understand that the message the Bible became a brand new book to brother brandham at the opening of the seals how many know that here the Bible became a brand new book to brother brandham even some of the things that he said very early on became a became something that was brand new uh to brother bamman if you don't follow uh his terminology and the qualifications he makes of that terminology it's very very easy you could almost come away from certain things from the message as that brother Brandon was teaching that the adoption is a fourth stage or fourth work of Grace yet we know throughout the entire message how many how many believers do we have here brother Brandon preached on justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he preached those three works of Grace as the three works of Grace are all a work of the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost justifies Holy Ghost sanctifies the Holy Ghost also speaks in tongues and does many gifts but that's not the whole that's not the person that's his gift brother bandam says but when you receive him you don't just receive my ink pen and you say that's brother Matt's inkpen all you've done is receive my gift but when you receive Christ as the true Holy Ghost when you're really born again you're receiving not his gift you're receiving him so brother Baron would preach on three steps of Grace Three works of Grace in your life and he backed that up biblically he also preached on four stages of restoration four steps of restoration he took the scripture out of Joel too and showed how that just as for death Messengers ate the life out of the church you had it in the old church you had it in the Dark Ages you had it through the Reformation right God was going to restore it back in four stages and God was going to brother BR would take justifica go go brother BR was going to take Joel chapter 2 the all that the locer all that the Locust all that the pomor all the cankerworm all the caterpillars e my great Army will I restore back unto you so he taught three steps of Grace but four works of restoration back to the church right that through that four stage that four that four stages of restoration and he typed it with a wheat plant and he typed how that the first seed that went into the ground right was was at the day was was the first The Original Seed was at that when pentec the Pentecostal church that Alpha Church The Acts 2 church was the original church he would say in the Ephesian Church age what they had at Pentecost is her inalab right right you know these quotes very well Pentecost is the standard there is no other standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern what the church had in the book of Acts but then you take that word Pentecost and you take Pentecostal denomination and then people get struggle between the two because we're not talking about a Pentecostal organization or denomination we're talking about Pentecostal experience brother brand I would say that Pentecost is not denomination it's an experience right and so if you don't follow his terminology it's very easy to come away thinking that as there was four stages of restoration through through through Luther through Wesley and then brother bham did use the isusa street 1906 Pentecost as a stage of restoration that God is restoring back to the church the life messenger it was part of the restoration right and he would use that uh Pentecost he says but notice but that that even though it was part of the framework even though it was part of the restoration it wasn't truly a return back to the seed right it was actually the Shu now for those young people that would hear that word and go what are they talking about Let me give it to you and make it very simple brother bham would use the wheat plant and he would take that plant to tight that just in a weat swe plant how you have a stalk you have a seed that goes in ground you have a stalk you have a tossle a blade a sprout that would come then you'd have a shook then in that Shu when you'd pull it back like a corn a you know a a a a a a thing of corn you'd pull that Shu back you'd have the seed and when you have the seed now it's returned back to the original seed that went in the ground and is this clear can we make it any clearer and so brother random would say what happened in the book of Acts go open your Bible to Acts chapter 2 notice this how God first poured out his Spirit he all that was in Christ all that was in God he poured into Christ all that was in Christ he poured back into the church and he fulfilled Joel too that's why Peter said this is that which was prophesied by Joel saying in the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men will dream dreams your young men will see Visions right and so it was a fulfillment what was he what was he showing that what God did in the book of Acts Church in the beginning under the first Church age messenger god was pouring back the Pure Life and for a season they walked with the full abstract right they walked with the real baptism of the Holy Ghost listen friends the thing that you receive when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost ain't no different than what they received on the day of Pentecost what you receive when you receive the Holy Ghost ain't no different than what Peter received when he came out of The Upper Room when they came out of the upper room speaking in other tongues listen friends if we ain't got that we've missed everything we've got to have what they had not what a church had not what a denomination had not what grandpa had not what a generation I'm not looking to go back a 100 years I'm looking to go back all the way to Acts chapter 2 and so when you receive the real life of Christ you're receiving the same thing they received right amen but then we know that that seed what that first church the Ephesian Church would eventually fall away you have the Bible ending with the book of Jude and Jude saying earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints and so men have crept in unaware spots there are in your Feast of Charity when they Feast with you feated themselves without fear clouds without water uh who men of old who were for ordained of this condemnation what was it it was that Antichrist Spirit brother brandham said the True Vine and the false Vine growing together and the you go back through that down through that then you go into the Dark Ages then you go through the age of the reformation and brother bham says whenever the spirit would come in like a flood God would raise up a standard to fight against it so when he when he rose up a spear uh he he gave a lion an ox an eagle and a man anointing and so when they would come with a do with a spirit God would raise up a standard to fight against that spirit and to be born to be born again for Luther was different than what it meant to be born again for you you because a man could only live up to the full potential of the word that was given to them hello and so to be born again was to live to the fullness of the word that was revealed well only so much of Christ was given back to Luther that's why men like men like the in the Reformation age could believe in a trinity and God would weak at that but he won't weak at it for you now he now the Bible says now He commands all that all men must repent repent of what not just your sins all of your thinking right and so God was going to restore that back but isua now you have to watch and I'm just going to take take just a second to say this you have to watch because now you have a prophet Messenger on the scene you have the Elijah Ministry on the scene that's going to have a message that would turn the hearts of the children you me back to the original Apostolic Faith and he's there at the same exact time even under those Assemblies of God's Min Ministries he's under there under the same time after the isua street Pentecost after the the Holy Ghost falls on isua street there's a prophet Messenger on the scene amen and brother Barham would say that what they thought was the restoration of the book of Acts Church could not have been why because the prophet messenger hadn't even even came on the scene yet and he hadn't given the former Reign which was the teaching reain which was the message of the hour when you reject the message you're rejecting the teaching ring you're rejecting the former rain you ain't never going to get the latter rain if you don't take the former rain you can pray and pray and pray and fast and fast and Fast and live holy holy holy but if you don't have the former rain you'll never get it you'll get a harvest of what you put in the ground I tell you what friends you put this faith in this message in the ground you'll get a Rapture when the Harvest when the when the lad ring comes and that's what's falling now but when the latter rain truly comes it's not that rain comes back to the seed and it doesn't come to send us into seven more ages it comes to take the grain oh brother R said we're going in an elevator to the sky it's the Harvest rain it's the Rapture rain it's the fullness of adoption you say what is the fullness of an adopted son when your body gets what your soul already has my soul's already been translated but one day this body is going to put on what my soul already has inside [Applause] of Hallelujah you say brother Matt what are you doing now now God's honing me now you say brother Matt do you believe there's a process of adoption I believe that's what I'm going through right now but I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm an adopted son then why would you you say you're in a process because this old flesh is still painful still gets headaches still gets backaches still gets angry sometimes mad upset temper come on Friends what's God doing what's the work of the Holy Ghost doing in my life I'm not looking to be justified I'm already Justified as though I never done it in the first place I'm not looking to be Sanctified I've already set aside for service I'm not looking to be filled with the Holy Ghost I've already received it I'm not looking to get my adoption where my name is is you know where my name brother Ram says when you're born of the spirit your name is as good on the check as his you say brother matth then what are you looking for more what else more come on does anybody feel that way I'm looking for more of Christ less of me more of him brother brandom says when that headstone comes down to the body you can't even fit but just a razor blade through there because that Holy Ghost is honing out Hallelujah I say hone me down lord Jesus and so so so if you f don't follow it closely you'd think that adoption even brother bram's adoption series that he takes you'd say brother Matt well then there must be some adoption some fourth step that we need to get to there is and it's called a body change but let me say this once a person has been sealed by the Holy Ghost once a person has been sealed by the Holy Ghost ghost they are then and only then born again yet even after this somehow some have believed that after they're born again somehow that you know there's got to be some you know for thing to give me power to give me Authority listen friends you have all power and authority of Heaven backing up your testimony that the brother bandam says that when the you put the word of God on the mouths of believers it'll never fail right and so they so so let me just move on through some of this and so I believe to rightly divide the word it's crucial that you must follow brother brenham's progression of both the terminology and the understanding of these terms you can write them down if you want to Born Again New Birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost cuz if you don't follow follow it closely you'll get the three brother brandham interchanges them to me as if they stand in opposition of each other when actually they're the very same thing as brother brenham's early early on in his ministry if you study the message early on in his ministry he's still viewing the Bible from a church view notice I said a church view I no longer call you church I call you bride what was he saying come out of those systems come out of those systems brother Ram is still viewing the Bible when you read some of the message he's still viewing the Bible from whether it's a Baptist fundamentalist View and he hears men like Charles Fuller on the radio and he takes some of those things and you'll find brother bandam saying some of those things or or he can be influenced by the Assemblies of God Pentecostal UPC people even taking things from those men who he hears on the radio and preaching them with that with those things he teaches that the white horse rider is Christ now friends I'm not here not for one second am I here to disparage God's Prophet now for one second am I here to to to try to cast some doubt I'm not preaching to that I'm not in any way disparaging my if anything I'm doing I'm personifying the Lord Jesus in him and so so it wasn't it's not to disp him I'm just going to I think it's important to understand this to rightly divide because I've had people ask me and say M why did brother bandam say that you can be listen listen to what he says he says the Cocker many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven now hold on brother Matt you just said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth it's the cealing of the Holy Ghost you could no more be lost than God could be lost right many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell now I had a brother read this and he was a young brother very sincere and said I don't understand this so you see how important it is to understand these things the Bible says so uhhuh that's exactly right that's leadership 1965 know that not and now the reason that people today now don't don't forget this you you'll see what's you he says you'll see what the holy what the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is now people can live in the spirit they dance in the spirit they shout in the spirit they go to church in the spirit they can absolutely have the real spirit of God anointed aha anointed notice this they can absolutely have that they shout of the spirit they can have anointed on the spirit but still be lost and just as devil possessed as they can be with that spirit so what could you could have the isua baptism and go to hell because the isua baptism though it was a work of restoration was not the token I'm talking about the gift to speak in tongues they in fact took that and said it was the evidence of the Holy Ghost to speak in tongues you could brother B says I've seen Witch Doctor speak in tongues right and so when we read this that don't mean one thing you're going to heaven you can have brother random is not saying you can be born of the spirit of God and be lost right and he says be lost just as Devil's best thing can be brother ROM says this is the think men's filter now father continu to the message the God of this world the anointed ones in the last day that outside the middle Circle so he gives the circles the Outer Circle you know this very well greatest battle ever fought the Outer Circle who's the Outer Circle who's the Inner Circle memory conscience reason imagination affection your spirit but then that little Inner Circle is the soul that is you this is not necessarily you this is really you one day this will be real the real me right now it's still mixed up with sin brother R says now he goes back to the circles and he says the ano the outside middle circle the first Circle the human sin second circle is the spirit will self- will desire but the inside is the soul that Soul was predestinated so they can anoint the spirit to make the outside body come in subject to the spirit but the soul that sinth he quotes that shall die Soul shall die the soul that rejects in unbelief the word of God which it is a part of that Soul shall ET turn Ally has always the spirit can come out here and anoint you to do certain things and do that but that don't mean you're saved think of it Caiaphas prophesied Judas cast out Devils see the spirit anointed him this is what it means to have the Holy Ghost on your flesh and still go to hell that's right the rain falls on the just and the unjust the weeds can Rejoice with the wheat but it's what's at I love this but it's what is at the core Hallelujah AR you intellectuals can say I accept that sure that looks good I believe that that still don't do it no sir and the spirit can actually make witness of it and still it isn't so because Works Faith because if that Soul hasn't come from God it can make all the impersonations out here but it cannot be real you can act healing hello you can act like you have you can act like you receive it Christians can act like they're Christians and act and ever be so good at it boy have we ever seen this hello man that brother was a preacher then the next year he's in adultery and he's lost his church cuz he was sleeping with another woman and he was a pastor preaching the message you say brother Matt did he have the Holy Ghost I have no doubt that he had the Holy Ghost here and even had a spirit witness of it I I got the testimony of a pastor just two hours from here that had a man that fell into adultery to this day he's living in adultery and he was a prolific profound minister of the message uh in the in the message preachers powerful preacher living with another woman and now has went back to his church and trying to get them to justify his second wife and that Pastor not him not the man who did but another Pastor said what's so confusing is he says that I would invite that man to come preaching my Sunday night service this is long before live streaming or anything like that or phone they had no phone hookup and he said that man would come to my Sunday night service and preach everything I preach Sunday morning you want to talk about an anointing and he said and all the while he was coming to my church to see that other woman you see brother you say brother Matt why why is it so important that we rightly divide these things because if you don't then people become so confused to say well what is the Holy Ghost if that soul is a cover it can make all the impersonations out here but it cannot be real you can act healing you can act like Christians they act and be ever so good but that don't mean they're saved that's exactly right the spirit can be there the real genuine Spirit the Holy Spirit how many have heard false anointed ones at the end time listen real an anointing false vessels real the Holy Spirit can anoint you that still don't mean you're saved it's that inside Soul That Never Dies it's got the eternal life it always was eternal life see it comes from God it goes to God it's the soul notice it's got to be Faith five F AI t h outside Spirit j s u s on the inside y u see that's how standing here looking at you I don't know one of you the spirit can anoint me still I don't know none of you but when that inside of the inside breaks in that's God that's where the outside can reason you take a man and say well you know I know I'm not supposed to commit adultery listen to this take a man and say well I know I'm not supposed to commit adultery but you know when the spirit tells me I shouldn't commit adultery brother Bram says but you know when the spirit tells me I shouldn't commit adultery but you see way down in there is still that thing in there see it'll kind of govern around better watch it he's saying when you hear I know I shouldn't and I know I shouldn't I shouldn't do that brother man says what is that that's a spirit that but he says it's so let me just let the prophet say it but when it's directed from the inside it throws all the rest of it together that's the guide poost that's the control tower the inside of the inside the soul controls the spirit the Spirit controls the body so an outside whitewash don't make any difference them religious people back there that called Paul wet white Whited walls and so forth they were that there that Paul called Whited walls and so forth they were outward just every way of a Believer and they had prophesies prophecies among them and everything else but the inside of the inside the soul that disbelieve that's the reason I say people can jump up and down speak in tongues people can shout lay hands on the sick heal the sick heal the sick and so forth by faith and these great things there by the spirit still be lost anointed ones my goodness anointed ones you say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that don't mean that you're saved not by a long way look at here you're a Triune being and you are inside that little fella here is the soul the next is the spirit the next is the body now you got five sents in this body to contact your Earthly home you don't contact the rest of it you got five senses of the spirit here love and conscious so forth of that but in here is where you live that's what you are didn't Jesus say the rain falls on the just and the unjust put a cockabur out here and a weed out here and pour water on them and keep them under fertilized and things like that won't they both live by the same water amen sure well what is it one of them will bear a cockle bur cuz that's all he is the cocko will ra raise his hands and Shout just the same as the wheat so notice this here if you if you follow this brother Brandon would say you can you can have an isua baptism let me just go through a few of these uh that I have forgive me that I keep jumping back and forth but I didn't get it all on the screen I don't think I need to I don't think I need to read anymore to say that what the ausa Pentecostals thought was the return of Acts 21 was not they were still under the age of men under a man anointing the anointing of the reformers isua had an outpouring of the spirit just as Luther and Wesley did but the fullness hadn't yet come can I get an amen you could actually as we just read have the isua baptism you can have just the isua baptism today and be lost friends there was ever a time for the token to be on display it's now you can actually have that isua baptism because why brother mat because it wasn't the person of Christ you see there's such a difference between having his gifts and having his fruits and those are good and they will be there but there's such a difference in having him say Well it must be the fruits by their fruits I what is the evidence brother matthan by their fruits you shall know them brother says I I thought that too and they said brother ma they said brother Brandon what is the true evidence of the Holy Ghost brother BR said love when you really love brother BR said sounded good sounded right but he said the angel the Lord corrected me and told me Noe that's not it because I've seen Christian Science perform all the fruits of the spirit and they don't even believe in the deity of Jesus Christ then it must be his gifts no see witch doctors yeah speak with tongues then what is it brother Matt being able to say Amen brother and sister that doesn't mean amen I believe the message that man I just talked about said amen amen means to come obedient to all that Christ has said can you say amen amen so you'll find that brother brandham even the Bible becomes a new book under that under that before the message before the but brother Adam did not start his ministry even quoting Malachi 4 it wasn't until years later he seen his position in Malachi 4 as the Elijah Ministry what was it it was not yet time but when the seals were open and Christ took the book brother Bram says the Bible become a brand new book prior to that he teaches things like that the new birth that being born again and the baptism of the Holy Ghost are two separate things you say well my goodness brother he also teach the white horse rider was Christ do we think the white horse rider is Christ no because the angel of the Lord corrected that you see even the angel wouldn't allow brother brandom to be wrong but would correct his teaching he taught that there was a persecution that was going to come to run all the denominations together and they would throw down all their walls and all denominational walls and bearers if we could just tear down these walls what we realize later is brother brand would say actually God came to separate and bring a people out of denominations not run them together but to bring them out of denominations for his name Revelations 18:4 come out of her that's your message come out of her not be joined with her come out of her my my people be not partake her of her sins not so that you receive not her plagues so he had these these ideas those are just a few things I could point out but when the Bible become a new book do you realize that even the Jews even uh even the Passover that that God was going to do something so profound when he gave a token when they would come out of Egypt because that Exodus was going to type your Exodus that the Bible actually says God told Moses to tell the people to take your calendar and throw it out and he says because this day will become the beginning of the New Year for you do you realize I just read that today friends that God says this shall be the beginning of months what was going to Mark a brand new beginning the giving of the Lamb Hallelujah do you realize do you catch it friends the calendar became new everything became new when the word is given they were given a new day a new look a new idea everything became new and when God restored this word the entire world became a new world the book became a new book I became a different person I looked at myself differently I looked at the Devil differently I looked at God differently when God reveals himself to you oh somebody help me preach tonight when God reveals himself to you everything becomes brand new this shall be a beginning the beginning of the year the Jews literally took their calendar and ripped it up and God says from now on the Passover the Pascal lamb this will be a new day what was it marking that God was going to send a lamb one day and when he sent that lamb the entire world was going to change the Covenant was going to change it was going to change my death sentence to a life sentence it was going to change my destiny to from Hell To Heaven so the so so brother brandham would I got three minutes Siri says three minutes so stay patient oh better not do that brother John somebody else's alarm will go off I'm sure a few people said [Laughter] them and so you'll find that brother Brenham teaches his church that the new birth he calls it this believing or having faith in Christ is not the same as receiving the Holy Ghost and that you're born again the he would say that you're born again the moment you believe well we know that brother baram the continuity of the message would show you that that's not was not correct that brother bram's errors were corrected at the opening of the word is that all right you say well them brother Mar why would he say things like that because he had people in his Fellowship that believed they had the Holy Ghost when they hadn't even been Sanctified he would say he would say things like God now I'm not saying you're not born again I'm just saying you haven't received the Holy Ghost you see how much confusion that would bring us well then I I can be born again but not have the Holy Ghost no you're only born again when you receive the Holy Ghost right but he be had people would say I'm not saying you're not born again but you're still out here smoking go read Blasphemous names your your daughters are still cutting their hair name all these sinful things and say they were born again you say the out what was he trying to do he's trying to get them to realize you have received something I'm not taking everything away from you but I'm trying to get you to understand you must receive more than what you've received and so he teaches this I'm just going to move since we've just got one minute left it's going to move very quickly here and so brother bandam says so if a man listen listen to I just want to I'm going to skip all of that and we'll pick it up another time I just want to come to one quote that I think makes it so clear what we understand clearly because we have the privilege of having the message from beginning to end is the what we what we see clearly is that being able to study the message from the beginning to the end is that actually his teaching on sermons like Blasphemous names and return and Jubilee the key to the door stature of a perfect man even countdown in 1962 and he calls that message statue of per of a perfect man building the living Tabernacle for the living God's dwelling place is actually those messages of what brother Bam's calling Born Again are actually what we know is justification and sanctification this one quote and I don't have it but I'm going to read it I think I if I could if I could surmise it down into one quote that I think says It Best in comparing to his previous thinking before the Lord corrected him before the word was open I should say in 1963 this is now 1964 whyatt had to be a Shepherd why it had to be Shepherds now I know terminologies of what born again is but let's just watch what happened in the Bible when they were born again Peter was a Believer the apostles were Believers this is prior to being born again Peter was a Believer before he was born again hello and he says Peter was a Believer the apostles were for a Believer but they wasn't born again until after the Holy Ghost fell on them at Pentecost brother brandham clears it up even better in the saman church AG you say well then what's Galatians 4 and and the adoption of sons do you realize it's Galatians 4 that brother Ram uses to preach the Capstone the the triumphal in that that the the the let me read it as as he says it the triumphal Capstone listen to what he says he says now comes our triumphal Capstone on the baptism of the Holy Ghost Galatians 4 and he quotes it when the fullness of time was come God forth s s of son made of a woman made it the law to the red under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because we are Sons God has sent forth his Spirit of sent forth the spirit of his son into our hearts crying ABA father wherefore wherefore thou are no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ there it is Jesus this is the prophet there it is Jesus Christ came forth died upon a cross accomplish Redemption which means to restore hello somebody what is redemption to restore to the original owner by means of purchase or paying the price and thereby placed us as Sons he did not make us Sons for we were all already his sons when was you a Son of God brother Donald when you were in sin Brother Brad when were you a Son of God hallelujah that's right brother Ken when were you a son when were you a daughter of God when I was born and when I came up no that's not win you were already a son oh it makes it so clear when you get a revelation of that I was always a son so what did what did the baptism of the Holy Ghost give me it adopted me into the family it took a son that was an orphan it would took a son who was an alien from God but a son in the back part of God's mind before the foundation of the world and it placed me back into the family Glory he did not make us Sons for we were already his sons but he placed us as Sons for as long as we were in the world in the flesh we could not be Rec recognized as his sons we were held captive by the devil but we were Sons nonetheless oh don't you love this message friends you might have not look like it but you were a son take courage Mom and Dad they might not look like it but in the back part of God's mind before the foundation of the world before Satan ever put his hands on them they were Sons and Daughters of God and one day he'll place them back into his family Hallelujah for as long as we were in the world we were Sons nonetheless and hear this because you are Sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart whereby you cry father father upon whom did the Spirit fall at Pentecost Sons them at Corinth Sons cornelius's house sons while they heard the word what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost let's let brother Brandon answer it it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth it is the spirit of God coming in and filling you after you have repented having hear heard his word and been baptized in water as an answer of a good conscience towards God Amen stand to your feet are you thankful to be a son you thankful to be a daughter to be a son and daughter of God to be part of this family of God brother bram's teaching us that we were always Sons but like orphans away from God alienated by what brother Matt by not what you did listen friends what alienated you from God don't let me lose you I'm still preaching Siri might have said I'm dumb but I'm still going I got this little break right here you say brother Matt what what what made me an orphan what separated me from God listen friends not your sins your birth birth just being born right and breathing breath separated you from God that's why Paul says the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly in other words I didn't ask to come into this world in sin but I was made captive and a slave to sin when I breathed my first breath but as brother brandham says you don't have to stay that way God gave Mercy to make a way back you don't have to stay a center brother brandom says oh he says if you ever go to hell you have to fight every inch of your life you have to you have to break over every barricade jump over every barrier to go to hell you'd have to break over every Act of Mercy that God has put in your life you are a alienated but the Holy Ghost baptizes you or let me say this adopts you am back into the family this is exactly what the body change is your body gets what your soul has already received that's why Paul says all nature all creation granth and travaileth how many are how many can I identify with nature and say this is this is what the Earth feels all creation you think you think the Earth isn't talking about naturalists listen friends the Earth is every bit much of alive alive as you are brother Adam says the Earth was in the book of life before the foundation of the world God had the Earth in his mind and one day this Earth though it might be filled with sin right now one day will rid itself of sin it'll receive a fiery baptism and there won't be no more war on my Holy Mountain says God there won't be no more hatred there won't be no more evil there won't be no more bitterness there won't be no more anger there won't be no more tempers there won't be nothing else nothing to harm us oh I'm looking forward to that day when this body receives what my soul says amen Lord my soul says I believe it with all of my heart one day my body will get what my soul's already received I'm looking forward to that day all creation granth and travelleth together until now waiting for what the manifestations of the sons of God to wit the Redemption of the body the fullness of adoption what will it mean what are you working towards now brother Matt what what do you believe about adoption what do you believe about this supreme token I believe that God has given us a supreme token and that Supreme token is not just here to tell me who I was I'm thankful to know who I was not to tell me who I'm going to be I'm thankful for who I'm going to be but it's telling me who I am now it condemn it convicts me of sin are you thankful for that it tells me when I'm wrong it tell tells me you need to shape up it tells me you need to get up a little bit higher tells me you need to get up off the ground tells me you need to overcome that thing that's what the Holy Ghost is here to do the Bible says it's here to reprove what's it doing it's reproving sin it speaks to me and says you know that ain't right you got to make it right you know you didn't say that right go back and make it right that's not me that's not you that's the Holy Ghost inside of you that's what the Holy Ghost is doing now he's honing us you say brother Matt what's he trying to do he's trying to conquer this he's trying to overcome what was the greatest Victory Jesus ever overcame himself and I want to say Lord if the Supreme token could do anything tonight let it so overcome me how many would pray that with me with a hand uplifted let it so overcome My Flesh brother Bram would say in perfect strength by Perfect weakness often times we say I need to be more strong brother bandam says that's not right you actually need to become more weak and I just want to raise a hand and I'll invite you to do it with me to say Lord let this token that I have this Holy Ghost down inside of me let it reprove me of sin Let It rebuke me if I need rebuke let it chastise me if I need chastisement discipline if I need it God but Above All Else conquer this Humanity that I have inside of me in so much that one day you'll conquer it and it'll take a change it'll take a change and that outward man will take on the beauty of the inward man and this corruptible will put on incorruption and this Mortal will put on immortality how many want it say God overcome me so much Lord that I don't see me anymore I see Jesus and him crucified I have his nature I have his character I have his life I have his love I have the very literal life of Jesus Christ and everything that comes with that Lord I raise my hands tonight and say God everything that this token was to give me I accept it Lord Jesus everything that this supreme token wants to do in my life Lord I want to receive it tonight God if you need to hone out if you need to take a Lord take a a razor and chop down and chop down then God I'm raising my hand to say whatever it takes Lord whatever it takes God if I could say there's too much of me still living then Lord let me say like Paul I want to know you in the power of your resurrection and the fellowship of your sufferings being made conformable under your death Lord what we realize after we've served you that it's all about dying life is all about dying it's all about life that leads to death we're not talking about Lord a just a a Earthly death but if there was ever a time or we need a funeral on the dying the death of our self God it's right now I raise my hands and say Lord let me die to myself Paul said let me die daily Lord let me die to me it's quit blaming him and her and them and they and look inwardly tonight friends and say God let this Holy Ghost this reprover let him look down with his magnifying glass in my life and if there's anything that would be unlike you oh if there was ever a day where the token has to be on display lord it's now let it be God let it be Jesus let it be Jesus oh could we raise our hands and sing it now for your mercy
