[0:00] are the same yesterday today and forever
[0:02] your heart
[0:03] towards your people is the same and
[0:06] whatever Satan throws at us we know we
[0:09] know that we'll overcome
[0:12] every wave that comes will crest every
[0:14] bit of it Lord and will will come
[0:16] through Lord by your grace
[0:19] all the way to the very end Lord
[0:22] we don't know we don't know our path we
[0:24] don't even know necessarily the next
[0:27] step on our journey Lord but we know you
[0:29] and we know that you're faithful and we
[0:31] know that your promises are immutable
[0:34] unchangeable
[0:36] Lord and we cling to that with all of
[0:39] our heart Lord we pray your blessing on
[0:41] on those who are away at the men's
[0:44] meeting on brother Jason and the
[0:47] ministry team there at the men's meeting
[0:49] blessed them and bless each of the
[0:51] Saints the brothers that are here
[0:54] from here that are there Lord just may
[0:57] it be a great refreshing time for them
[0:59] and watch over them as they travel as
[1:02] well father we commit ourselves to you
[1:04] father we want to we want to step out of
[1:07] the way
[1:08] we want you to come
[1:10] we want you to take over
[1:12] we ask these things in Jesus precious
[1:14] name
[1:15] amen
[1:17] amen so our look at our first scripture
[1:20] and really we're going to be spending
[1:22] much of our time looking at this in
[1:26] Hebrews chapter 6.
[1:28] and brother Josh if you want to help me
[1:30] control it appreciate that
[1:34] and the small version came through I
[1:36] hope they are not all like that
[1:37] otherwise we might as well just take it
[1:39] down
[1:41] those of you in the front row if you
[1:43] want to come up here you can probably
[1:44] see it if you stand right next to the
[1:46] screen
[1:49] um
[1:49] amen Hebrews 6 verse 4 so I guess we're
[1:52] going to be old school you can if you
[1:54] have a Bible
[1:56] you could turn to that and if you're new
[1:58] school if you have a phone which you all
[2:00] do you can look at that
[2:04] for it is impossible for those who are
[2:06] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[2:08] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[2:11] the Holy Ghost
[2:12] and have tasted the good word of God and
[2:15] the powers of the world to come
[2:17] if they shall fall away to renew them
[2:20] again unto repentance seeing they
[2:22] crucify to themselves the Son of God
[2:24] afresh and put him to an open shame may
[2:29] the Lord add the blessing to the reading
[2:31] of his word you can be seated
[2:33] you say your your title is very strange
[2:37] married to the backslider and you read
[2:41] this scripture which can be sometimes
[2:44] looked at as a conundrum Hebrews chapter
[2:47] 6.
[2:49] and that's what I want to spend time on
[2:54] looking at this and looking at it in the
[2:57] context of the scripture and the message
[3:00] so when we're looking at this verse
[3:02] These verses it appears
[3:05] that's what it's saying is when if
[3:08] someone
[3:09] Falls away if they fall away
[3:12] the word following means to deviate from
[3:14] the right path
[3:17] they cannot
[3:19] be renewed in Repentance
[3:22] okay so that's taking the scripture just
[3:26] at face value
[3:27] without understanding anything beyond
[3:29] that you would look at that and say a
[3:31] person can have genuine faith
[3:34] genuine genuine experience with God and
[3:38] then fall away from this experience with
[3:42] God
[3:43] look at what it's saying if we go back
[3:46] there they were enlightened they were
[3:48] taste they tasted of the Heavenly gift
[3:50] they were made partakers of the Holy
[3:53] Ghost they tasted the word of God they
[3:56] tasted the powers of the world or the
[3:58] age to come
[4:00] so
[4:03] what is this telling us
[4:05] very strange it's almost you almost read
[4:08] it in it in a way it feels discouraging
[4:12] what hope do I have
[4:14] if if I would fall away I can't repent
[4:17] again I can't come back to Salvation
[4:19] because I'm I'm crucifying the Son of
[4:23] God a second time if I were to do that
[4:28] thank God these aren't the only verses
[4:30] in Hebrews chapter 6. or the whole Bible
[4:35] they are verses and they are true
[4:38] but until you look at the con the rest
[4:40] of the context you'll be confused and
[4:42] you see people that hold to that that
[4:45] are against
[4:46] eternal security
[4:48] perseverance of the Saints they always
[4:50] bring you this scripture oh I see what
[4:52] you're saying about predestination but
[4:54] this scripture proves all the rest of
[4:56] the Bible wrong
[4:58] oh okay interesting
[5:02] again it's it seems like this is saying
[5:04] two things a person has had an
[5:07] experience with God and they can fall
[5:09] away from the faith
[5:12] and a person that has fallen away
[5:14] cannot come back because it would be a
[5:18] second crucifixion of Christ
[5:21] but I want to show you scripturally
[5:24] these things are that's an impossibility
[5:28] so we can't take this verse and again
[5:31] this is a huge mistake that many people
[5:33] make whether it be a message believer or
[5:36] not a message believer is you take one
[5:38] verse or series of verses out of context
[5:42] and create a whole Doctrine surrounding
[5:45] this you knuckle down on two verses
[5:48] and then reinterpret the rest of the
[5:51] Bible or the rest of the message in
[5:53] order to arrive at the point that you're
[5:54] trying to make and that's that's a great
[5:56] error great mistake
[5:59] the subject matter could go on and on in
[6:03] the message you know a person could
[6:04] could take the few quotes where brother
[6:06] Branham says Jesus is is not God
[6:09] but then dismiss a thousand quotes that
[6:13] he says he was God
[6:15] and so you we never want to do that for
[6:18] anything
[6:19] we want to understand its context we
[6:21] want to understand how brother branham's
[6:23] understanding was developing over time
[6:26] the things that he taught when the sea
[6:28] when the seals were opened if the Lord
[6:30] showed him I've been I've been corrected
[6:32] on this thing again we take the whole
[6:35] context not our favorite context
[6:38] not the one that we like that arrives at
[6:41] our conclusion but we take the whole
[6:43] word of God
[6:45] that's critical
[6:48] if if if we take Hebrews 6 4-6 and make
[6:53] the point that I've made about it we
[6:56] would then have to dismiss an avalanche
[6:59] of scripture
[7:02] so again it's saying the person was
[7:04] enlightened they've tasted the Heavenly
[7:05] gift made partakers of the Holy Ghost
[7:07] tasted the word of God tasted the powers
[7:09] of the age to come seems like a very
[7:13] good experience doesn't it seem good to
[7:16] you does it doesn't it seem like
[7:18] something that you want
[7:20] absolutely
[7:24] person that has experienced
[7:28] justification in their lives they've
[7:30] been born of the spirit of God
[7:33] cannot fall away from the faith you can
[7:37] have ups and downs in your life you can
[7:39] backslide but you can never permanently
[7:43] fall away this would be dishonoring God
[7:46] in Christ and it would just demonstrate
[7:49] that God is Not omnipotent
[7:53] and it would show that the the Father
[7:55] and Son aren't in unity
[7:57] are in disagreement let's look at the
[8:00] next scripture John 10
[8:02] verse 28 and 29
[8:06] and and also verse 30.
[8:09] Jesus speaking and I give unto them
[8:12] eternal life
[8:14] all right so there there's our start he
[8:16] gives them he gives them eternal life we
[8:20] don't give ourselves eternal life
[8:22] we don't choose to have eternal life
[8:26] but he says I give my sheep
[8:31] eternal life
[8:32] and they shall never perish
[8:36] so
[8:38] if they've been given eternal life if
[8:40] they if they're in other words if
[8:41] they're enlightened they taste of the
[8:43] word they they're partakers of the Holy
[8:46] Ghost
[8:46] they fall away they could never renew
[8:49] themselves again to repentance must be
[8:51] speaking of something something
[8:52] different
[8:54] because here Jesus saying I give them
[8:57] eternal life they'll never perish it
[8:59] doesn't say anything about what we do
[9:02] doesn't say anything about us now this
[9:05] is the honor and glory of God through
[9:08] Jesus Christ I give them eternal life
[9:11] they will never perish there's he
[9:14] doesn't give any exceptions to that
[9:17] they'll never perish neither shall any
[9:20] man pluck them out of my hand
[9:24] so in other words there's going to be
[9:26] people that seek and there's going to be
[9:28] demon spirits that are going to try to
[9:30] pluck you out of Christ's hand
[9:34] but he says it's impossible
[9:38] the next verse
[9:43] My Father which gave them me
[9:46] is greater than all
[9:50] and no man is able to pluck them out of
[9:52] my father's hand
[9:54] all right so Jesus says the Son of God
[9:57] says no one I give you eternal life
[9:59] you'll never perish
[10:01] you'll not be plucked out of my hand my
[10:04] father is greater
[10:06] than all
[10:08] no one can pluck them out of his hand
[10:09] what is the next verse
[10:13] I and my father are one
[10:19] we're I Jesus and the father are in
[10:22] unity to the fact of this
[10:25] you'll never be lost you'll never perish
[10:30] that's just one scripture we have many
[10:31] more to talk about as we go on but I
[10:34] want to get back to Hebrews 6.
[10:37] a person that's been given eternal life
[10:40] cannot lose it
[10:43] you'll never perish you'll never be
[10:45] plucked out of his hand
[10:48] secondarily the other point we made is a
[10:51] person certainly can repent
[10:54] and receive restoration
[10:55] you can get saved
[10:57] you can backslide horribly
[11:00] God can call you to repentance and he
[11:04] and you respond with repentance
[11:07] and God will restore you completely
[11:11] how many believe that
[11:14] so we can't take Hebrews 6 to violate
[11:16] that principle of scripture either
[11:19] that's a misunderstanding to say well if
[11:22] someone has true salvation they
[11:24] backslide they're finished
[11:29] brother Luther
[11:31] it's unscriptural
[11:33] Jeremiah chapter 3
[11:36] verses 12-14
[11:39] go and Proclaim these words towards the
[11:42] North and say return thou backsliding
[11:45] Israel saith the Lord
[11:47] and I will not cause my anger to fall
[11:50] upon you for I am merciful saith the
[11:52] Lord and I will not keep anger forever
[11:56] only acknowledge thine iniquity that
[11:59] thou Hast transgressed against the Lord
[12:00] thy God and has scattered thy ways to
[12:03] The Strangers under every Green Tree
[12:05] and you have not obeyed my voice saith
[12:07] the Lord turn
[12:09] oh backsliding children saith the Lord
[12:11] for I am married unto you and I will
[12:13] take you one of a city and two of a
[12:15] family and I will bring you to Zion so
[12:18] that's God's heart
[12:20] this is this is a people of course it's
[12:22] speaking of a national identity
[12:25] Israel as as a nation but that's made up
[12:28] of individuals
[12:29] and so he's calling out to those
[12:32] individuals that make up that Nation
[12:33] you're not listening to me you're not
[12:35] hearing my voice you're not responding
[12:38] so my wrath is against you and I'm going
[12:40] to drive you from this land nevertheless
[12:43] he says you backsliders if you repent if
[12:47] you hear my voice you come back I'll
[12:49] receive you I will restore you I'll give
[12:51] you a city
[12:54] Hosea 14 4.
[12:58] I will heal their backsliding I will
[13:02] love them freely for my anger is turned
[13:05] away from him hosea's life is a perfect
[13:08] expression of that Hosea to Marry The
[13:11] Prostitute who kept running away from
[13:13] him and he he kept running after her no
[13:16] matter how rotten she was how terrible
[13:19] she was he kept running after her and
[13:22] that's the heart of God
[13:24] so again we can't take Hebrews 6. and
[13:27] and completely throw God's heart away
[13:29] God's heart is when someone turns to him
[13:32] no matter how bad it is
[13:34] I mean how much worse can you get than
[13:37] what Hosea
[13:38] Gomer did to Hosea
[13:41] and yet you can't get any worse in the
[13:43] relationship of a husband and wife and
[13:45] yet what happened he kept going after
[13:48] her why because it was supposed to
[13:50] express the heart of God
[13:55] first John 1 verse 9.
[13:59] how do we how do we look at and Define
[14:03] backsliding
[14:05] brother Branham says I backslide every
[14:07] day
[14:08] that's that in one sense in another
[14:10] sense you could say you know look at
[14:12] look at the children of Israel they
[14:14] worshiped idols
[14:17] that's like an unto the what happened
[14:19] between Hosea
[14:21] and Gomer
[14:22] they worshiped idols and God said if
[14:25] you'll just hear my voice and repent and
[14:27] come back I'll receive you and I'll
[14:29] bring you to Zion
[14:32] think of God's grace
[14:34] just just just comprehend that for a
[14:37] moment
[14:38] does he anyone that comes to him will he
[14:40] turn them away scripture says he'll
[14:42] anyone that comes to the son
[14:44] I will in no eyes cast out
[14:48] this is God's heart and even somebody
[14:51] says ask brother Brandon a question and
[14:52] answer
[14:54] I I've backslidden I've done terrible
[14:57] things can I come back he says if you
[15:00] want to come back it shows you can come
[15:03] back
[15:04] so again Hebrews 6 is something that
[15:08] many times it's it's absolutely the
[15:09] truth I'm not trying to denigrate the
[15:12] scripture I want you to see the context
[15:14] I'm emphasizing this so that we don't
[15:17] dislocate this scripture from the rest
[15:19] of it so that we do understand
[15:22] God loves the backslider he says I'm
[15:24] married to that backslider and I'm gonna
[15:27] go get that backslider and bring them
[15:29] bring them back because it's my glory at
[15:31] stake
[15:33] he said they'll never perish no one will
[15:35] pluck them out of my hands even if that
[15:38] sheep is doing his best to get lost he
[15:40] says 99 I'm going to leave and I'm going
[15:42] to go find that one
[15:44] and he doesn't it doesn't matter how
[15:46] bruised battered and broken that God
[15:48] himself gets through that he's going to
[15:52] find that sheep because he said I will
[15:55] never lose it
[15:58] so when we when we see this God when we
[16:01] confess our sins he's faithful and just
[16:03] to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
[16:06] from all unrighteousness
[16:08] I don't see any qualification I don't
[16:10] see any well if
[16:13] you do this if well if you did this
[16:15] there's no forgiveness if you did that
[16:17] there's no forgiveness he just says if
[16:19] you confess the only requirement is
[16:22] confession repentance
[16:25] and he will forgive and he's faithful
[16:27] and just to forgive us our sins
[16:30] and to cleanse us
[16:32] second chronicles 7 14.
[16:35] If my people which are called by my name
[16:38] very famous scripture shall humble
[16:40] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[16:43] turn from their Wicked Ways then will I
[16:45] hear from heaven and will forgive their
[16:47] sin and will heal their land
[16:50] that's God's principle he doesn't put a
[16:54] limitation on what the Wicked Ways are
[16:57] look if the Wicked Ways are like just
[17:00] like this
[17:01] then I can then there's forgiveness but
[17:03] if the Wicked Ways are like you know
[17:04] this and this and this never
[17:08] okay you say how about blasphemy of the
[17:11] Holy Spirit there's no forgiveness for
[17:12] that absolutely the truth
[17:15] if you blaspheme the Holy Spirit
[17:18] but the thing is about a person that
[17:19] blasphemed the holy spirit is they
[17:23] remain
[17:25] stubborn and steadfast in their
[17:28] rejection of the work of the Holy Spirit
[17:34] Paul the Apostle
[17:36] says he was a blasphemer Paul blasphemed
[17:39] the Holy Spirit
[17:40] and yet Jesus went after him because he
[17:42] was one of the elect
[17:43] and he forgived forgave his sins
[17:47] so really ultimately to a person that
[17:51] turns to Christ there is no limit
[17:54] to his forgiveness
[17:56] aren't you thankful aren't you glad for
[17:58] that I'm glad for that let's have that
[18:01] towards each other too let's remember
[18:03] that because in Hebrews 6
[18:06] a person many times Cults use this for
[18:10] fear to control the people if you go out
[18:13] from us if you go if you leave the group
[18:15] there's no repentance there's no
[18:18] there's no forgiveness I'm just telling
[18:20] everyone who's left Bethel Tabernacle
[18:22] and dislikes us and hates us come on
[18:26] back we love you
[18:27] there's forgiveness there's repentance
[18:30] and there's love amongst the people
[18:32] don't let the devil lie to you and say
[18:35] you won't be accepted here the people
[18:36] like me I did too much that's from hell
[18:41] can I can I get a raised hand and an
[18:44] amen to that
[18:45] I wish we had a camera right here to
[18:47] show everyone if they're listening in
[18:50] you're welcome here we love you you
[18:52] might have called us all kinds of names
[18:54] come on back we love you
[18:56] we love you no matter what
[18:59] we want we want to see God's blessing
[19:01] and God's best and we want to see you
[19:03] walking with him in Victory and joy and
[19:06] peace that's God's heart this is God's
[19:09] heart
[19:13] if you don't want to come then don't
[19:15] come nobody's forcing anybody
[19:18] we want to see we don't want to see a
[19:21] bunch of people whose hearts are far
[19:22] from God and living under the thumb of
[19:25] some perception
[19:27] get that perception out of your head the
[19:28] ministry team has no desire for any of
[19:32] this any of that nonsense we just want
[19:34] to see your heart so in love with Jesus
[19:39] Proverbs 24 16.
[19:43] for a just man fallest seven times
[19:47] in that wonderful
[19:49] and riseth up again
[19:51] but the wicked shall fall into mischief
[19:54] let's let's not be so holy around here
[19:58] that we think that you know our ministry
[20:01] team our leaders they never fall and
[20:04] make mistakes
[20:05] we all do
[20:07] but guess what we're getting up again
[20:09] and we're walking forward with God but
[20:12] the wicked fall
[20:14] and they remain where they fell
[20:17] that's the that's the difference
[20:19] everybody falls
[20:21] everybody sins
[20:25] but The Godly they stand up
[20:27] dust themselves off Lord help me I made
[20:30] a mistake I sinned against your word
[20:32] it's a serious thing we don't treat sin
[20:35] lately it's a very serious thing we but
[20:38] we dust ourselves off Lord forgive me
[20:40] cleanse me and we keep walking forward
[20:47] so if you backslide from the faith
[20:50] you can be restored
[20:54] this is not speaking the Hebrews 6 is
[20:57] not speaking of a person that's received
[21:00] genuine salvation and then they go to
[21:03] lose it
[21:04] and then they can't regain it no that's
[21:06] not what it's speaking of
[21:08] so let's look at the context a little
[21:09] bit more Hebrews chapter 6 back to that
[21:13] and we're going to read verses 7 and 8.
[21:19] this is a direct answer I believe to
[21:22] this for the Earth which drinks in the
[21:24] rain
[21:25] that cometh oft upon it and brings forth
[21:29] herbs meat for them by whom it is
[21:31] dressed receives blessing from God
[21:36] but that which Bears thorns and Briars
[21:38] is rejected and is nigh under cursing
[21:41] whose end is to be burned
[21:45] oh my
[21:46] so what are those two verses telling us
[21:49] so the ground what does the ground do
[21:51] when it rains
[21:52] soaks it up
[21:55] when it when it falls when it comes
[21:58] hopefully it soaks it up otherwise you
[21:59] have a flood but under normal
[22:01] circumstances we have
[22:04] that's providing nutrients and strength
[22:07] to the ground so that whatever is in it
[22:11] uh Sprouts comes to life grows
[22:15] so good good we're looking at good
[22:18] ground
[22:20] in verse 7
[22:22] this is good ground
[22:24] why because it brings forth herbs or it
[22:26] brings forth fruit for the farmer
[22:30] so the per the whom it is dressed that's
[22:33] the farmer
[22:34] and and that good ground brings forth
[22:37] good fruit and receives blessing from
[22:40] God
[22:41] but
[22:43] the evil ground the bad ground the bad
[22:46] field
[22:47] produces thorns and Briars and what the
[22:51] farmer does when his field produces
[22:53] thorns and prayers is he burns it up
[22:58] so it's nigh under cursing who's and
[23:00] whose end is to be burned it's going to
[23:02] be burnt so the context and the bigger
[23:04] picture that Paul is presenting is two
[23:07] kinds of fields
[23:10] one is a good field
[23:12] one is a bad field
[23:16] and so what is what is that outward
[23:19] Force that's coming upon it rain
[23:23] the Bible says the rain falls on the
[23:25] just and the unjust
[23:28] so the same rain that makes
[23:33] the fruit tree grow or the wheat grow
[23:36] also makes the thorns and the thistles
[23:39] grow
[23:41] so it's receiving the same rain these
[23:43] who are once enlightened
[23:45] none of those verses say they had
[23:47] eternal life
[23:48] I mean if we look back at at those
[23:50] verses in Hebrews four through six
[23:52] doesn't say they have eternal life
[23:54] it doesn't say that they have faith
[23:56] which causes them to endure to the end
[23:58] it says they were once enlightened
[24:00] tasted of the Heavenly are they uh made
[24:04] partakers of the Holy Ghost all of these
[24:06] things it speaks about none none of that
[24:10] says they have faith and hope that
[24:14] endureth to the end
[24:17] both Fields have all those five things
[24:19] they have enlightening the Heavenly gift
[24:21] partaking of the Holy Ghost tasting the
[24:23] word of God tasting the powers of the
[24:25] age to come they both experience
[24:29] that anointing
[24:31] but when that anointing comes on the
[24:34] good field it produces good fruit when
[24:37] that anointing comes under thorns and
[24:39] thistles it produces
[24:41] thorns and thistles
[24:44] both Fields experience the rain
[24:49] Matthew 7
[24:52] 21 not everyone that saith had to be
[24:55] Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom
[24:56] of heaven
[24:58] but he that doeth the will of My Father
[25:00] which is in heaven in other words it's
[25:03] not merely an outward confession
[25:06] but it's an out it's an outward
[25:09] confession that's accompanied by a life
[25:12] that is living in submission to the will
[25:15] of the father
[25:20] many will say to me in that day Lord
[25:22] Lord
[25:23] have we not prophesied in thy name and
[25:25] in thy name have cast out devils and in
[25:28] thy name done many wonderful works then
[25:31] I will profess unto them I never knew
[25:33] you depart from me ye that work iniquity
[25:38] so it isn't the one that can produce
[25:40] miracles
[25:41] it isn't the one that can point to
[25:44] something on the outside but it's it's
[25:48] the one that has something on the inside
[25:51] that's producing a life on the outside
[25:54] both groups have Miracles Matthew 7 Mark
[25:58] 16 these signs shall follow them that
[26:00] believe
[26:02] and those who are calling to him Lord
[26:04] Lord
[26:05] but don't do his will also have signs
[26:08] also have miracles
[26:10] in the anointed ones at the end time
[26:11] brother brother Branham says Moses a man
[26:14] sent from God with the word of God and
[26:17] on his journey taking Israel into the
[26:19] Promised Land
[26:20] strictly with the Commandment of God he
[26:22] met another prophet
[26:24] another anointed one that had a genuine
[26:27] anointing
[26:28] of the same holy spirit that was upon
[26:30] Moses that's right he was a prophet the
[26:34] Holy Spirit was upon this man his name
[26:36] was Balaam we're all acquainted with him
[26:38] well the very things the same things
[26:40] that the man said is still taking place
[26:42] about 2 800 years ago Thou Art like a
[26:44] unicorn of Israel whoever blesses you
[26:46] will be blessed but we know that Balaam
[26:49] was a false teacher and what was the
[26:52] fruit that he brought forth in his life
[26:54] Disobedience to God's word
[27:00] where does Jesus draw the difference
[27:03] in Matthew 7.
[27:06] obedience to the word the fruit of your
[27:09] life is obedience to the word you say
[27:11] what in the world does this have to do
[27:13] with backslider you'll see
[27:16] yeah you'll see you'll see the picture
[27:18] trying to do with God a service without
[27:20] it being his will
[27:24] it is possible a man or woman with all
[27:26] sincerity
[27:27] trying their best to do God a service
[27:29] and stirred it in the wrong way
[27:33] listen
[27:34] with a genuine anointing of the Holy
[27:37] Spirit upon them but stirred it contrary
[27:40] to God's plan for the age and Chaos the
[27:44] whole thing
[27:45] now if you believe that's the truth say
[27:47] Amen
[27:48] we just read it chaos the whole thing by
[27:51] not coming God's provided way to do it
[27:56] what's God's provided way to do it by
[27:58] the word
[28:00] it's it's people that they they have the
[28:02] same signs outwardly
[28:04] but what are they doing they're going
[28:06] contrary to the word
[28:08] we're talking about what Hebrews 6 4-6
[28:12] is talking about
[28:13] a person with an anointing a person
[28:15] that's religious a person a person that
[28:18] looks like they're trying to follow
[28:20] God's word
[28:21] a person that looks looks to me like a
[28:23] Pentecostal
[28:25] charismatic
[28:27] right
[28:28] they've got signs they've got demons
[28:30] being cast out they've got miracles
[28:32] they've got prophecy
[28:33] and we what is it they're contrary to
[28:36] God's original program and what do they
[28:39] do they chaos the whole thing
[28:43] thank you
[28:44] a thinking man's filter brother Branham
[28:47] says notice now woman they want to have
[28:50] bobbed hair they want to wear shorts
[28:51] paint makeup these little bikinis and
[28:54] things that way that they wear nowadays
[28:56] they want to do it and yet they want to
[28:58] go to church you see that anointing upon
[29:01] the spirit
[29:03] not upon the soul
[29:06] so what is the what is what is the
[29:07] difference between the anointing on the
[29:09] spirit and the anointing on the soul the
[29:11] anointing on the soul is what brings
[29:13] transforming power
[29:15] the soul is the nature of the spirit and
[29:18] God wants to get that nature that's
[29:21] inside of the soul to agree with his
[29:23] word and so when the when the true
[29:26] anointing baptism of the Holy Ghost
[29:28] comes upon that Soul it changes
[29:32] everything but when that anointing comes
[29:34] upon the spirit it brings what does it
[29:37] bring it brings change
[29:39] it rings it brings miracles
[29:43] but it doesn't bring transformation on
[29:47] the inside of the inside
[29:49] that brings religion
[29:52] trying to do God of service without it
[29:54] being his will now notice that in this
[29:56] now David thought he had everything in
[29:58] order and he was inspired see how the
[30:00] Holy Spirit can anoint a man but it's
[30:03] got to be in the order of the anointing
[30:04] the outside Spirit can be Anointed with
[30:07] the Holy Ghost
[30:08] and the Soul as dark as pitch my
[30:12] that's exactly what Hebrews 6 is talking
[30:16] about
[30:17] a person that is Anointed
[30:20] and it's a genuine anointing but it's in
[30:23] the wrong place
[30:24] the cockleberg grows on the same water
[30:27] that builds puts life into the wheat
[30:29] puts life into the cockle bird but at
[30:31] the bottom
[30:32] of the cocklebur it's a cocklebur life
[30:35] listen it's rejoicing and blooming and
[30:37] got life and doing everything that the
[30:40] wheat does but the soul of it is
[30:43] cockleberry see
[30:44] false teachers can rise teaching all
[30:46] kinds of trinitarianism and everything
[30:48] else and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost
[30:49] and prefer listen and perform just as
[30:53] many miracles as the true gospel can
[30:56] but by the word here that's what does it
[30:59] see what I mean
[31:02] that's what we we need to be looking at
[31:05] and understanding is we can have
[31:08] wonderful anointings we can have
[31:10] wonderful emotions I'm not against it
[31:13] one bit we should have that
[31:16] amen but the point being is you can also
[31:18] have that and not be right with God
[31:21] not be not have the not have the genuine
[31:23] New Birth
[31:24] not be not be following
[31:28] the truth of the word
[31:29] it can be a deception on the outside
[31:31] that doesn't mean we throw away emotion
[31:33] throw away Supernatural no that follows
[31:37] them that believe but we also understand
[31:39] that's that is the place where the devil
[31:43] will also deceive
[31:45] don't get it out in order and say oh we
[31:47] have Miracles we have signs we have
[31:48] Supernatural we have emotion in our
[31:50] services okay so what
[31:53] we should have that but that's not our
[31:57] absolute
[31:58] the word of God is our absolute and our
[32:02] first let your heart be
[32:06] aligned with the word then let the other
[32:09] things follow that
[32:12] when the anointing comes the
[32:15] enlightenment of the Gospel comes the
[32:16] tasting of the word all these things
[32:19] come and it can anoint the spirit
[32:22] of a man or a woman
[32:24] but not bring a genuine birth in the
[32:27] soul
[32:28] how does it do that very simply put is
[32:31] the only person that can have a genuine
[32:34] birth in the soul is the one that was
[32:37] chosen in Christ before the foundation
[32:39] of the world who's had the seed of God
[32:42] placed in their soul so that when the
[32:45] word is preached the light strikes that
[32:47] seed and it comes to life
[32:49] otherwise there's not a spot for them if
[32:52] you'd read in John 8
[32:54] Jesus tells the Pharisees my word has no
[32:57] place in you
[32:59] that's why they call him a devil that's
[33:01] why they call him the devil is because
[33:02] the word has no place in them just like
[33:05] if you're trying to send a Wi-Fi signal
[33:07] to a brick it can't receive it
[33:10] but if you have if you have an iPhone
[33:15] maybe an Android sometime to bless your
[33:17] hearts
[33:19] you can receive that signal
[33:26] you can receive that signal in in a
[33:29] phone or a laptop or a tablet
[33:33] or uh or or a computer you can receive
[33:36] that signal there's something in it to
[33:37] receive it but you try to send a Wi-Fi
[33:39] signal to a brick
[33:42] it can't it can't accept it
[33:44] can't take it and that's what the
[33:46] problem is the person can get the
[33:48] anointing on the spirit but there's no
[33:50] place for the word in their soul
[33:53] there's no predestinated seed there so
[33:55] they they get anointed they get
[33:57] religious they shout they speak in
[33:59] tongues they dance in the spirit and so
[34:01] does the real believer
[34:03] but yet what what is the ultimate
[34:06] brother Branham says but by the word
[34:09] here that's what does it not by miracles
[34:13] not by dancing not by tongues but by the
[34:16] word Jesus makes that same exact
[34:19] difference is he that does the will of
[34:22] my father that's the one who will be
[34:24] accepted when they say Lord Lord
[34:28] the Holy Ghost Reign it falls on the
[34:30] wheat seed and produces bread for the
[34:32] master's table the Holy Ghost Reign
[34:35] falls on a Thistle and it produces more
[34:37] thistles
[34:39] that's what it does and that's what
[34:40] Hebrews 6 is talking about he cannot be
[34:43] renewed again to repentance because
[34:44] there's no spot for repentance in him
[34:46] Esau
[34:48] he repented with tears right
[34:51] but he didn't find it
[34:53] no why because he wasn't predestinated
[34:55] to find it
[34:57] Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated
[35:01] Jacob could repent though it was a long
[35:04] time before he did finally repent he
[35:07] finally did repent
[35:08] Esau tried to but couldn't find it isn't
[35:13] it interesting well that's not fair
[35:15] God's not fair
[35:16] who are you
[35:19] the thing form
[35:20] to say to him that formed it why have
[35:23] you made me thus
[35:25] God is the Potter you're the clay
[35:28] you can't change a wheat into a thistle
[35:33] God has ordained it to be a wheat
[35:35] it will be a wheat
[35:37] no matter no matter how messed up it
[35:39] grows this direction that direction it's
[35:42] always going to be a wheat
[35:45] it might not be a very fruitful wheat
[35:48] but it'll still be a wheat right
[35:50] if it's a thistle you're not going to
[35:52] make bread from it I'm sorry as hard as
[35:55] you want as bad as you want to try you
[35:58] cannot it's not ordained to produce
[36:00] bread
[36:03] and it cannot repent it cannot be
[36:06] renewed to repentance because it can
[36:08] never do it in the first place
[36:13] in the indictment brother Branham says
[36:16] notice this they crucify to themselves
[36:18] the son of God afresh
[36:21] what did they do what by having a taste
[36:24] and knowing that it's at the it's the
[36:26] truth and then turn around and denying
[36:29] it what did it do it's impossible
[36:32] right so they they taste it they see it
[36:34] they see the Vindicated word brother
[36:36] Branham took this Hebrews 6 and brought
[36:39] it into something that was applied in
[36:43] the last age to the church age and the
[36:46] denominational system
[36:48] then and the people in it what did they
[36:51] do they crucified the word of God afresh
[36:54] by denying it they see it manifested
[36:57] they say oh that's a genuine Prophet
[37:00] yeah the Pentecostals did anyways but
[37:02] don't listen to the word
[37:03] don't take the word the very reason the
[37:05] Miracles came was to point us to the
[37:07] word
[37:08] that's out that's always to have
[37:10] preeminence any real brother bam says
[37:12] any real miracles of god produces a
[37:15] message
[37:19] so does that mean that someone that
[37:22] leaves the message
[37:24] says they don't don't agree with it can
[37:27] never come back
[37:28] that's again this is not talking about
[37:32] the predestinated seed
[37:34] this is not talking about the wheat
[37:37] plant that produces the bread on the
[37:40] master's table it's talking about a
[37:42] cocklebur
[37:47] Hebrews 6 9 but beloved again we're
[37:50] continuing the context
[37:52] he's talking about he talks about the
[37:53] two fields and we read about that
[37:56] and he says but beloved
[37:58] oh now who are we talking to we're
[38:00] talking to the Beloved
[38:02] the Beloved of God the elect of God we
[38:05] are persuaded better things of you
[38:09] and things that a company salvation
[38:12] though we thus speak
[38:15] you see this warning
[38:16] he's put the warning before him but he
[38:19] says there's better things for you I
[38:21] know I know that there's better things
[38:23] for you
[38:24] things that accompany salvation I like
[38:28] that we realize that there's things that
[38:30] accompany salvation
[38:33] there's things that go along with it
[38:35] if you have salvation there's things
[38:38] that accompany that it's not just
[38:41] salvation and there's no accompaniment
[38:43] to it there's salvation and things
[38:46] follow
[38:51] for God
[38:52] is not unrighteous to forget your work
[38:54] again he's not he's not going off and
[38:57] jumping off to a different subject
[38:59] he's talking about the same subject and
[39:02] he's trying to point out here is what
[39:04] I'm talking about here is the good fruit
[39:07] that the good field produces for God is
[39:10] Not unrighteousness unrighteous to
[39:12] forget your work
[39:13] and labor of love which you have showed
[39:16] towards his name in that you have
[39:18] ministered the Saints and do Minister
[39:20] and we desire that every one of you do
[39:22] show the same diligence
[39:25] to the full Assurance of Hope
[39:28] to unto the end that you be not slothful
[39:31] but followers of them who through faith
[39:34] and patience inherit the promises
[39:38] that's that that list of things that
[39:41] Paul is speaking about is quite
[39:42] different than the other list that he
[39:45] spoke about the ones enlightened tasting
[39:48] of the good word of God and and so forth
[39:50] and the powers of the age to come this
[39:53] one is speaking of things that accompany
[39:55] salvation
[39:56] it's one thing it's one thing to be
[39:58] religious it's one thing to have an
[40:00] anointing it's one thing to make a
[40:02] profession an outward profession I
[40:06] believe this message I believe in Jesus
[40:07] Christ I believe he's the same yesterday
[40:09] today and forever fantastic
[40:12] that's tasting that's being enlightened
[40:15] but that's not the same thing as the
[40:18] things that accompany salvation
[40:22] a true experience of eternal life
[40:25] a true experience with the person of
[40:28] eternal life produces these things we're
[40:30] reading about here
[40:32] what what does he say I'm
[40:34] God is not unrighteousness to forget
[40:37] your work your effort that word
[40:39] literally means effort
[40:41] so this is company salvation what a
[40:44] company salvation effort
[40:47] and labor of love the word labor there
[40:51] literally refers to troubles and trials
[40:55] so in other words the troubles and the
[40:57] trials that you face because of love
[41:03] and he says which you have showed
[41:05] towards his name towards the Lord Jesus
[41:07] Christ
[41:09] how so in that you have ministered that
[41:12] you've served
[41:13] the Saints and do serve
[41:18] so these are the things again reminding
[41:21] you they accompany salvation true
[41:24] salvation is accompanied by what Paul is
[41:27] pointing out right here
[41:30] and we desire that everyone you show the
[41:33] same diligence oh there's diligence
[41:36] diligence for what
[41:38] diligence to the full Assurance of Hope
[41:43] to the end in other words there's some
[41:45] something inside of you
[41:48] when you've received salvation it brings
[41:51] a diligence
[41:53] that brings you to that
[41:55] complet complete assurance
[41:58] you have completed your Assurance of the
[42:01] word of God because God cannot lie his
[42:04] promises never fail so I can have hope
[42:07] to the end again hope is not just a wish
[42:09] in the Bible hope is an Earnest
[42:12] expectation
[42:14] an Earnest expectation of what just some
[42:17] random thoughts that you had no an
[42:19] Earnest expectation of God's promises
[42:22] that he's made to you
[42:24] that you're going to endure to the end
[42:27] that he you don't have to you don't have
[42:29] to be in fear and worry oh I wonder if
[42:33] I'm one of those that's just been
[42:34] enlightened and tasted the good word of
[42:36] God and and I'm just going to ultimately
[42:38] fall away and know
[42:40] I believe God's promises I will be there
[42:43] at the end
[42:45] not because of anything I do but because
[42:47] the work that he's doing in me
[42:52] that you be not slothful
[42:56] you're not lazy
[42:57] so this is something that accompanies
[42:59] salvation
[43:01] it takes away all laziness slothfulness
[43:04] from you
[43:06] it causes you to be a follower of the
[43:10] Believers from the past that we have the
[43:13] example in the scriptures that they
[43:15] through faith and patience inherit the
[43:18] promises
[43:20] even the ones that never in this
[43:22] lifetime inherited them
[43:25] but We'll Inherit them in the age that
[43:27] is to come Abraham never got
[43:30] even a little bit of land had to buy
[43:33] just a burial spot that's really his
[43:35] only possession in the Promised Land
[43:40] but he endured with patience to the end
[43:43] a lot of mistakes did Abraham make a lot
[43:46] of mistakes
[43:47] God didn't account that to them he was
[43:49] faithful
[43:51] through faith and patience he inherited
[43:53] the promises what was the secret to
[43:55] Abraham we told you that before he fell
[43:57] down seven times and rose up
[44:00] eight
[44:02] amen so that that is that that is a
[44:05] great great difference between the one
[44:07] who's anointed
[44:10] merely on the outside and the one who is
[44:13] truly changed who has experienced
[44:16] genuine salvation
[44:19] Matthew 10 verse 22. I hope this is an
[44:22] encouragement to you
[44:27] and you shall be hated
[44:29] of all men for my name's sake
[44:33] but he that endureth to the end shall be
[44:35] saved
[44:36] you're going to be persecuted you're
[44:38] going to face trials and difficulties
[44:40] bad things are going to happen because
[44:42] of your faith sometimes sometimes you
[44:45] see people say well you know
[44:49] I if I do this if you know for example
[44:52] if I wear a skirt at work it's going to
[44:54] cause me troubles okay
[44:57] isn't that going to cause isn't being
[44:59] having faith in Christ didn't he say it
[45:02] wasn't cause everybody trouble
[45:05] he didn't say I've come so that your
[45:08] life would be so easy he said I didn't
[45:10] come to bring peace but a sword
[45:13] and so
[45:14] yes there's P abiding peace on the
[45:17] inside contrary to the circumstances we
[45:21] face on the outside
[45:24] amen but he that endures till the end
[45:27] will be saved so that looks to me like a
[45:31] conditional
[45:32] promise of salvation
[45:35] it isn't a conditional promise of
[45:37] salvation but it's saying there's things
[45:39] that accompany salvation if you have
[45:43] salvation you will endure to the end
[45:49] again
[45:51] in our in our picture in Hebrews 6
[45:54] it's not speaking of a backsiding
[45:56] believer that tries to repent it's
[45:59] speaking of a cocklebur
[46:01] that bears evil fruit in their life they
[46:05] believe with all their heart this is
[46:07] what brother branham's presenting it as
[46:08] if you go back look at anointed ones at
[46:10] the end time and the vision that the
[46:12] lord gave to him when he went to those
[46:15] Pentecost that Pentecost his first
[46:16] Pentecostal meeting he was shown and
[46:19] it's clear this is someone who believes
[46:21] they're doing right
[46:23] they believe they've got the real
[46:25] anointing they believe they're going in
[46:27] the right way but their life
[46:29] is producing something different
[46:31] remember the story about the two people
[46:33] one was speaking in tongues wasn't one
[46:35] was interpreting brother has brother
[46:36] Branham has the vision he sees one their
[46:38] life they're godly people another one
[46:40] he's running with some other woman
[46:42] both anointed
[46:45] but them but the man thinks he's right
[46:47] and he's hiding his sinful life
[46:51] a Believer a believer that falls
[46:55] is always welcome to repent by God
[47:00] if but if you do have salvation it's
[47:03] going to produce something in your life
[47:05] ultimately again there's ups and downs
[47:08] in everyone's life we see that clearly
[47:11] by example in the scripture
[47:15] there's falling there's failing if there
[47:16] wasn't there'd be no need for John to
[47:19] write if we confess our sins he's
[47:21] faithful and just to forgive us our sins
[47:23] and to cleanse us from all
[47:24] unrighteousness that would be unneeded
[47:26] because we as soon as you get the Holy
[47:28] Ghost you're perfect and you never sin
[47:30] the rest of your life well in God's eyes
[47:33] you never sin in the first place
[47:35] but that's not because of you that's
[47:37] because of the blood of Jesus Christ
[47:38] that was shed for you
[47:40] and you put your faith and trust in him
[47:42] only then that's washed away but by Our
[47:46] Lives we experience we we sin
[47:48] we have a a sticky nature and we'll have
[47:51] that until we have a new body
[47:55] but if you do have salvation it's
[47:57] producing the life of Jesus Christ in
[48:00] you
[48:03] II Timothy 2 verse 13. I have always
[48:07] read this scripture and it just
[48:09] continually stuns me
[48:13] if we believe not he's writing to
[48:15] Christians
[48:18] if we believe not yet he abides faithful
[48:22] he cannot deny himself
[48:24] people try to reinterpret this and say
[48:26] well
[48:28] you know if if you're not if you're not
[48:29] a Believer it doesn't affect God he's
[48:32] still faithful well why does he say he
[48:36] cannot deny himself at the end
[48:39] this the issue is himself
[48:41] him denying himself so in other words
[48:44] you as an elected child of God you might
[48:47] come to this place where your faith is
[48:49] so weak
[48:50] I came to this place about a year ago
[48:54] faith is so weak you couldn't trust God
[48:57] for anything
[48:58] right you're almost dead
[49:01] I I was laying in that hospital so weak
[49:05] my faith was I was I felt like I was in
[49:08] darkness
[49:10] what what did God do
[49:13] he couldn't deny himself
[49:15] God sent Mercy
[49:19] I love I love the expression God doesn't
[49:22] just throw uh throw a life vest to us in
[49:28] the ocean
[49:28] that's not our predicament we're not
[49:30] just lost in the ocean we're actually a
[49:32] dead body at the bottom of the ocean
[49:35] God dives off the ship to the Bottom of
[49:39] the Sea grabs our dead body brings us up
[49:42] to the shore and breathes new life into
[49:44] us
[49:45] and I feel like that's what the Lord did
[49:46] for me I I was I was done
[49:51] but he's faithful
[49:53] even when we're not faithful
[49:55] even when our faith is weak he cannot
[49:58] deny himself
[49:59] that's the god that we serve that's the
[50:03] god that we love
[50:05] he why why does he say he cannot deny
[50:08] himself
[50:09] because you're a part of him
[50:12] you're a part of his life if he denied
[50:14] you he would be literally denying
[50:17] himself
[50:18] isn't that glorious
[50:22] Philippians 1 6.
[50:24] and I am sure of this
[50:26] I'm sure of this Paul was sure of this
[50:31] that he who began a good work in you
[50:36] will be faithful to complete it until
[50:38] the day of Jesus Christ will bring it to
[50:41] completion
[50:43] he he is he started the work did you
[50:45] start the work
[50:47] did you call yourself
[50:49] did you call yourself to Faith did you
[50:52] search and find and look for God
[50:55] everywhere you could go I was running
[50:57] from God
[50:59] and God was running after me that was my
[51:01] experience
[51:03] I wasn't searching I was fighting my way
[51:05] as hard away from God as I could and God
[51:09] was fighting as hard as he could to grab
[51:12] me
[51:13] and open my eyes and open my ears and
[51:16] changed my life and that's what he did
[51:20] it was literally nothing that I did he
[51:22] chased me
[51:24] he caught me
[51:26] God never fails at his work does he he
[51:28] caught me he started the work
[51:31] I'm not the one that started it
[51:33] I'm not the one that's doing it
[51:36] and I'm not the one that's going to
[51:37] finish it
[51:39] he started it
[51:42] everyone has to remember that
[51:45] if he hasn't started the work in in you
[51:47] there's an altar
[51:50] there's a there's a place you can come
[51:51] to
[51:53] come to the Lord give your heart to him
[51:56] you know and and all it took for me I
[52:00] remember driving down the road on on the
[52:03] way home from a meal with friends that
[52:04] were talking to me about The Bible and I
[52:06] just said Lord I want to live for you
[52:09] and from that point all the burdens left
[52:12] my shoulders and my desire was for him
[52:15] I had a lot of problems I had to face I
[52:17] had a lot of transformation that I
[52:19] needed in my life
[52:20] but he he has done it
[52:23] and he's still doing it and he's going
[52:25] to do it until the day of Jesus Christ
[52:30] that's God's ultimate work in you and me
[52:34] I I cannot keep myself if it was up to
[52:37] me I would certainly Fall Away
[52:40] my faith would go weak and I would just
[52:42] go after the desires of the flesh but
[52:45] there's something on the inside of the
[52:48] inside that's preventing me from ever
[52:50] doing that
[52:57] some of my favorite verses series of
[53:00] verses in the entire Bible here in
[53:03] Romans 8.
[53:06] after he began he explains
[53:08] predestination and the fact that we're
[53:10] predestined to be conformed to the image
[53:12] of Christ Paul then says this what shall
[53:15] we then say
[53:17] to these things
[53:20] what do we say now
[53:23] if God be for us
[53:25] who can be against us
[53:29] he that spared not his own son
[53:31] but delivered him up for us all how
[53:35] shall he not with him also freely give
[53:38] us all things
[53:41] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[53:44] God's elect it's God that justifieth
[53:49] who is he that condemns it's Christ that
[53:51] died yea rather that is risen again
[53:53] who's even at the right hand of God who
[53:55] also makes intercession for us
[53:59] who shall separate us from the love of
[54:02] Christ shall tribulation
[54:04] or distress
[54:06] or persecution or famine or nakedness or
[54:11] Peril or sword
[54:13] I mean that's some heavy stuff
[54:16] that's some serious difficulties spoken
[54:18] of right there even the sword that comes
[54:21] to chop our head off is not going to
[54:22] separate you from the love of Christ it
[54:25] might separate your head from your body
[54:27] but it's still not going to separate you
[54:29] from the love of Christ
[54:36] as it is written for thy sake we are
[54:38] killed all the day long we are accounted
[54:41] as sheep for the slaughter nay
[54:44] in all these things we are more than
[54:47] conquerors through him that loved us
[54:50] I want you to see this
[54:52] what is a conqueror another way to say a
[54:54] conqueror is an overcomer
[54:56] why are we Overcomers
[54:59] what's the whole context of what he's
[55:00] talking about now he's not jumping to
[55:02] another subject he's talking about the
[55:04] same thing
[55:06] why are we Overcomers because nothing
[55:08] can separate us from the love of God in
[55:11] Christ Jesus
[55:13] that's why you're a conqueror that's why
[55:15] you overcome that's why you defeat the
[55:16] enemy because nothing could separate you
[55:19] from him from his love
[55:22] God it's God that justify us who is the
[55:24] one that condemns it's Christ that died
[55:27] nothing can separate you from that
[55:30] not even you
[55:33] sometimes we try hard but it's still not
[55:37] going to happen
[55:39] for I'm persuaded that neither death nor
[55:42] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[55:45] powers nor things present nor things to
[55:48] come
[55:49] nor height nor depth nor any other
[55:51] creature shall be able to separate us
[55:53] from the love of God which is in Christ
[55:55] Jesus our lord
[55:58] nothing
[55:59] there's no devil in hell
[56:01] there's no person on this planet
[56:03] that can take you away from his love
[56:07] and there's a lot that goes along with
[56:09] that that doesn't mean
[56:11] you can live any kind of life
[56:13] if you're if you have the love of God in
[56:16] your heart it constrains you to live a
[56:20] pleasing life to him
[56:22] so part part of this
[56:25] the love of God keeping us to the very
[56:27] end and nothing separating from that is
[56:30] the work that he's doing in our life
[56:32] again you know it's it's easy you know
[56:35] that you can become a a super calvinist
[56:39] and say hey I don't I can just I just
[56:42] believe and live any kind of life no
[56:45] if you believe
[56:48] it produces a different kind of life
[56:51] and it doesn't take it you you put your
[56:54] effort you put your strength you put
[56:56] your whole life into it but at the end
[56:58] you realize that the whole thing was God
[57:01] moving inside of you
[57:04] Paul made the statement that I work I
[57:07] work harder than all of the other POS
[57:09] the apostles
[57:11] and what is what is his next statement
[57:13] yet not I
[57:15] but Christ the grace of God in Me
[57:21] and so that's what's working the grace
[57:24] of God is Not merely a nice saying that
[57:28] says he passes over your sins or he has
[57:31] his favor on you but the Grace Grace
[57:33] speaks of him putting his Supernatural
[57:38] effort in power in your life to change
[57:42] you
[57:43] Grace means favor but when that favor is
[57:46] on you
[57:47] his hand is on you
[57:49] you know we read we read in in uh I
[57:51] think it's
[57:52] I think it's Psalm 34. though I could be
[57:55] wrong about David who he David says his
[57:59] hand was Heavy upon me
[58:03] my moisture is turned into the drought
[58:05] of Summer
[58:06] and yet the first verse is starts out in
[58:09] that chapter blessed is the man whose
[58:12] transgression Is Forgiven amen
[58:15] whom the Lord to whom the Lord does not
[58:17] impute sin but what preceded that was
[58:21] David
[58:22] keeping silence David not repenting not
[58:26] confessing his sin to the Lord so God
[58:28] put his hand heavy upon Him David falls
[58:31] into depression
[58:32] falls into sorrow what was that
[58:34] depression and sorrow that David went
[58:36] through that was God's love
[58:39] that was God's love to get him to open
[58:42] his mouth and confess his sin and repent
[58:45] to the Lord
[58:46] so that he could experience the blessing
[58:49] of being the man whom God does not
[58:52] impute sin to
[58:54] doesn't say that the man is sinless
[58:57] but it says the man doesn't have his
[58:59] sins counted to his account
[59:03] Psalm 34
[59:05] verse 22 and the ESV says the Lord
[59:08] redeems the life of his servants
[59:10] none of those who take refuge in him
[59:13] will be condemned
[59:16] isn't that beautiful that that that goes
[59:19] to our Point earlier if you have a heart
[59:22] to run and take refuge in Christ
[59:25] you won't be turned away you won't be
[59:26] pushed away you won't be condemned the
[59:29] Lord will redeem you it's the Lord's
[59:31] work salvation is of the Lord
[59:34] again he starts it he's doing it and he
[59:37] completes it
[59:41] John 6 39.
[59:45] and this is the Father's will which has
[59:48] sent me that of all which he has given
[59:50] me I should lose nothing but should
[59:53] raise it up again at the last day
[59:57] is Jesus going to lose anything
[1:00:00] he says you'll lose nothing so there's
[1:00:04] there's no way you can fall away
[1:00:06] from genuine salvation
[1:00:09] and this is the will of him that sent me
[1:00:11] that everyone which seeth the son and
[1:00:13] believes on him may have everlasting
[1:00:16] life and I will raise him up at the last
[1:00:19] day this is a promise
[1:00:22] this is a promise this is not a maybe
[1:00:25] this is not an if this is his work this
[1:00:29] is what he accomplishes he will do it
[1:00:32] Ephesians 4 30 musicians if you'd come
[1:00:36] and do not grieve the holy spirit of God
[1:00:40] whereby you are sealed
[1:00:42] until the day of your Redemption
[1:00:46] we certainly can grieve the Holy Spirit
[1:00:50] right
[1:00:51] otherwise Paul what what's the point of
[1:00:53] saying it we can do things in our lives
[1:00:56] we can have certain attitudes and it
[1:00:59] Grieves the influence of the holy spirit
[1:01:02] away from us but it doesn't grieve the
[1:01:04] holy spirit away from you because if
[1:01:06] you're sealed with it you're sealed
[1:01:08] until the very end
[1:01:10] but you can do things that grieve the
[1:01:12] Holy Spirit
[1:01:13] and that Holy Spirit is going to lay his
[1:01:15] hand heavy on you
[1:01:17] and he's going to lead you to repentance
[1:01:19] that's his love
[1:01:21] again it's don't get these things out of
[1:01:24] order
[1:01:25] don't get predestination out of order
[1:01:26] that somehow you can live any kind of
[1:01:29] life and you're going to make it in the
[1:01:31] end the true and you'll have ups and
[1:01:34] downs no question don't if you believe
[1:01:36] if you love the Lord Jesus with all your
[1:01:39] heart you'll be saved
[1:01:42] you will be
[1:01:43] don't but don't think that that doesn't
[1:01:46] carry consequences in it remember
[1:01:48] there's things that accompany salvation
[1:01:53] okay so you're you're saved then what
[1:01:56] your life just looks like the world
[1:02:00] no
[1:02:01] there's many things and we didn't get to
[1:02:03] the scriptures I've got probably
[1:02:05] 40 more
[1:02:08] Pages here so whenever I preach text
[1:02:10] I'll finish it but
[1:02:12] there's many more things we can look at
[1:02:14] and see
[1:02:16] but the react this is the thing is that
[1:02:18] when you believe
[1:02:20] when you have real salvation your faith
[1:02:23] again is not your work your something
[1:02:25] that you did
[1:02:27] it's by grace are you save through faith
[1:02:29] that not of yourselves it's the gift of
[1:02:32] God not of Works lest any man should
[1:02:34] boast
[1:02:35] go go back further what we talked about
[1:02:37] it's the seed predestinated seed being
[1:02:40] in the soul when the word comes to that
[1:02:43] it quickens it to life
[1:02:46] then there's ups and downs there's
[1:02:48] struggles there's trials but God is the
[1:02:51] one keeping you to the end
[1:02:54] if you can explain your life
[1:02:57] by your own by your own and your your
[1:02:59] walk with God by your own merits by Your
[1:03:02] Own Strength it's very doubtful you have
[1:03:04] the Life of Christ
[1:03:06] I personally can't explain what the Lord
[1:03:08] has done in my life
[1:03:10] how he's led me how he's kept me through
[1:03:12] all that we've all that all the ups and
[1:03:14] downs and the trials and tribulations
[1:03:17] he is I can't explain this he who began
[1:03:20] a good work
[1:03:21] in me
[1:03:23] will be faithful to complete it until
[1:03:25] the day of Jesus Christ
[1:03:29] you you that have that hope inside of
[1:03:33] yourself the Bible says you'll purify
[1:03:36] yourself even as he is pure
[1:03:39] that that word in you produces a life
[1:03:44] yes you can fall away yes you can make
[1:03:46] terrible mistakes
[1:03:48] terrible what did David do he was a
[1:03:51] predestinated seed of God no he didn't
[1:03:53] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[1:03:55] he committed adultery and murder and
[1:03:57] covered the whole thing up with a
[1:03:58] conspiracy
[1:04:00] and what did he do he repented and God
[1:04:03] received his repentance
[1:04:04] so
[1:04:06] we can go through all kinds of ups and
[1:04:07] downs but it shouldn't be in our heart
[1:04:09] to want to do that
[1:04:11] our heart will run from that turn from
[1:04:15] that and yet if you do
[1:04:18] God is there if you just turn to him
[1:04:21] if you say Lord I was wrong I said I
[1:04:24] sinned I made a terrible mistake please
[1:04:26] forgive me
[1:04:27] he will absolutely
[1:04:30] forgive you we we know that's the truth
[1:04:33] in the promise of god let's stand up
[1:04:35] we'll pray
[1:04:39] Heavenly Father we're so
[1:04:41] thankful and so grateful
[1:04:44] for your word Lord I pray this would be
[1:04:46] a
[1:04:47] encouragement and a strengthening to
[1:04:49] Believers Lord
