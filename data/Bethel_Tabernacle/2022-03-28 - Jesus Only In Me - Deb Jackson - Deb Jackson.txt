TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] sometimes i feel so far away from where i'm supposed to be the trials [Music] are flooding over me the burden of my heart a war within my mind but peace will come when i recall a desire deep inside his words in my mouth his hands reaching out his love in my life his way in my sight jesus only jesus only the path ahead of me is settled in my soul i'm anchored to the holy one and he will be my goal the mind of christ in me by this i shall prevail the only way to overcome every time i fail his words in my mouth his hands reaching out his love in my life jesus only jesus only his words in my mouth his hands reaching out his love in my life his way in my sight jesus only jesus only in me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
