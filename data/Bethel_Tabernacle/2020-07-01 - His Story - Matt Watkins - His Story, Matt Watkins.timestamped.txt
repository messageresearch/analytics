[39:34] none whatsoever I'm so glad we got the
[39:37] peace of Jesus here tonight amen I want
[39:40] you to look here with me in your Bible
[39:43] too Daniel
[39:44] we're just going to read just one verse
[39:46] here just a few verses here in Daniel
[39:48] chapter 1 and I just would like to take
[39:51] just for a moment here a thought that
[39:55] Lord just pressed upon my harp and I'm
[39:57] titling this his story his story and the
[40:03] real simple thought here tonight we're
[40:04] going to just take the first part of
[40:06] this and maybe just do a little bit of
[40:08] teaching and it may seem like a a just a
[40:12] little bit of a teaching lesson and I
[40:14] just felt led to do this felt impressed
[40:16] I won't stay in that gear probably the
[40:18] entire sermon but I would like to just
[40:21] look at something that I believe is real
[40:23] relevant for for right now and I believe
[40:27] that we have a word that is relevant
[40:30] always has always been but I do believe
[40:33] that there are things in the word that
[40:35] are specific for right now for the for
[40:39] not just this age lady see an age
[40:42] there's words there's there's things
[40:44] written in about the Lydia scene church
[40:46] age very specific there's a people
[40:49] that's written about that's very
[40:50] specific but I believe even fur
[40:52] than that God hasn't forgotten about us
[40:54] time is not just unwinding itself just
[40:57] like a clock that's been spun up but
[41:00] gods and he's sovereign and he's in
[41:03] control Amen right now today Wednesday
[41:06] night
[41:06] right now July 1st is it the first today
[41:09] God's in control right now
[41:11] amen I believe that let's look here in
[41:14] Daniel chapter 1 the third year of the
[41:15] reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
[41:18] Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto
[41:21] Jerusalem and besieged it and I just
[41:24] want to stop right there we'll just have
[41:26] you pray Lord we thank you Father for
[41:28] this service tonight we ask God for you
[41:31] to take your preeminence Lord only just
[41:33] a handful of people Lord in person Lord
[41:36] maybe those that weren't able to come
[41:38] father trusting that they are streaming
[41:41] Lord at home father whatever various
[41:43] place that they're in and that their
[41:44] Lord that they're participating in
[41:47] worship Lord for we believe now more
[41:49] than ever before your word told us that
[41:52] we should assemble ourselves more so as
[41:54] we see the Day approaching Lord and we
[41:57] truly see that day the coming of the
[41:59] Lord Jesus the soon coming Lord we see
[42:02] it approaching father we feel it more
[42:04] than we more than just seeing it Lord
[42:06] more than just reading about it
[42:08] we can sense it father in our spirit
[42:10] Lord and I pray God that you'd help us
[42:12] to be sensitive tonight Lord to your
[42:14] word may God you just be our help Lord
[42:17] we ask in all things in Jesus Christ's
[42:19] name Amen amen thank you musicians you
[42:23] can be seated I want you to hold your
[42:26] place there in the book of daniel and as
[42:29] i said bear with me just for a moment
[42:31] because i'm gonna draw something out of
[42:33] this that i believe is important for us
[42:37] to understand this book of daniel is a
[42:41] book that has came up a lot especially
[42:44] things that are happening in the world
[42:47] right now as we know were you know all
[42:50] there's more than just coronavirus now
[42:53] the entire world is just going crazy
[42:56] and and and now books like revelation
[43:00] people believers who hadn't looked at
[43:01] the book of revelations now
[43:04] looking at the Book of Revelations and
[43:06] people without understanding are looking
[43:08] for answers the world is looking for
[43:10] answers and I'm glad that we have them
[43:13] tonight we have answers clear answers in
[43:16] the word and you know maybe you know
[43:19] sometimes it takes a stirring like this
[43:22] that we're sensing right now and it
[43:25] takes a shaking like what we sense right
[43:28] now has happened in the world sometimes
[43:30] God uses that as a measure to stir even
[43:33] his own bride to even stir his own
[43:36] people we know that even the wise and
[43:40] foolish virgin both were the parable
[43:42] both were asleep now one had oil one
[43:45] didn't but both were in slumber even at
[43:48] the coming of the Lord behold the
[43:49] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
[43:51] and so we know that even us are we even
[43:54] us speaking of the elected seat of God
[43:58] still live in this world we're still
[44:00] subject to a body that's not born again
[44:03] that's not redeemed we still have a body
[44:06] that gives us trouble we have mistakes
[44:09] we have faults and we have failures our
[44:12] soul has been raptured and translated
[44:15] into the kingdom of his dear son as the
[44:17] Bible says but these bodies aren't born
[44:19] again and they give us trouble every
[44:21] single day now if y'all are going to be
[44:22] that quiet you might as well not come to
[44:24] church so you're here so use your voice
[44:27] that God gave you say Amen if I ever
[44:29] needed your amens now it's now so so
[44:33] pull on the Word of God don't sit there
[44:34] and go to sleep on me I'll come down off
[44:36] this pulpit and stand there in front of
[44:38] you and spit in your face you don't want
[44:39] me to do that do you
[44:40] you got masks on so what would it what
[44:43] would it harm you right all right
[44:44] brother Mack just get back to your
[44:46] sermon so we we noticed this here that
[44:49] that our bodies aren't born again as we
[44:51] said we still are subdue and become
[44:55] subjected to the age that we're living
[44:58] in even the panic and the fear and the
[45:01] pandemonium we can be we can ingest some
[45:05] of that as a believer but we have a we
[45:09] have something to stabilize this I'm
[45:11] glad for that and that's the word I want
[45:13] to just look here just for a moment and
[45:15] I want to look in this Book of Daniel
[45:17] and we're going to take
[45:18] is just a lesson we actually taught one
[45:19] lesson I think on Sunday school on this
[45:22] and we're gonna cover some of those
[45:23] points and then come to something
[45:25] preaching to you tonight on his story
[45:28] and you look at this this book that's
[45:32] filled with many stories that we have
[45:34] I'm going to go through some of these
[45:35] very quickly so just listen and be
[45:38] attentive as best that you can but there
[45:41] are parts of this book that we find that
[45:43] are very easy to comprehend very easy to
[45:47] read and understand you have the stories
[45:49] of Daniel in the lion's den you have the
[45:52] story of Shadrach and meshach and
[45:54] abednego and those are things that we we
[45:56] know very well and then there's parts
[45:59] that even as believers we tend to skip
[46:02] over some of the parts that we don't
[46:04] understand and when you get deep into
[46:05] the Book of Daniel there's parts of it
[46:08] that are symbol and it becomes very much
[46:10] like the book of Revelation where the
[46:13] book of Revelation is just it's there's
[46:15] so many symbols and symbology you better
[46:18] have a church age book you better have a
[46:19] sales book sorry that you can go back to
[46:22] and say what is this meaning right here
[46:24] because you can make the Bible mean
[46:26] anything you want it to mean you can
[46:28] give it whatever I think it means this
[46:30] but friends we don't have to think we
[46:32] have a clear vindicated word we can go
[46:36] to and say AHA this is what it means in
[46:39] the Book of Revelations when it speaks
[46:41] of this symbol this is how it translate
[46:43] and how I identify it today I'm glad for
[46:47] that and so Daniel is very much the same
[46:51] exact way that it's a book that covers
[46:53] 75 years of the life of this man Daniel
[46:59] it's unique it's the Old Testament book
[47:02] that Jesus refers to in prophecy in
[47:04] Matthew 24 he picks Daniels prophecy of
[47:07] the 70th week in the 70 weeks of Daniel
[47:10] Jesus refers to it so we know that out
[47:13] of all the books in the Old Testament
[47:15] there all of them are important all of
[47:17] them are interlocking they all support
[47:20] the overall story of redemption they
[47:22] they're all within the Canon of
[47:24] Scripture they're all profitable yet
[47:27] there are certain books in your Bible
[47:29] that are highlighted or they
[47:31] are specific for the day and age that
[47:34] you and I live in they're there they're
[47:36] in there in bold if I could say it that
[47:39] way they're larger not that they're any
[47:42] more important or at some books are less
[47:44] important but the Book of Daniel is
[47:46] gonna have something that's very unique
[47:49] above all the other books in the Old
[47:51] Testament and that it's going to go and
[47:54] transcend past the time of Daniels life
[47:57] and half of what Daniel is going to
[48:00] write will not happen in his lifetime
[48:02] but will happen in history or in his
[48:07] story that's what we're preaching on
[48:09] here tonight two types so we understand
[48:12] that that the Book of Daniel is we said
[48:15] it covers 75 years of Daniels life but
[48:18] it's going to cover thousands of years
[48:21] of what we call history or we call time
[48:25] we have many different words for what we
[48:27] call time generations and we we live
[48:30] only in the element of time so our own
[48:33] human intellect only understands time
[48:36] even when you try to express eternity
[48:39] when we look at eternity and when if you
[48:41] were to ask yourself what is eternity
[48:43] well our only human definition is no
[48:46] time it's just endless it's time it's a
[48:49] space but but that's that's really not
[48:51] what eternity is so much more than just
[48:53] no time but eternity is what it what
[48:57] everything that happened in time is all
[49:00] - to bring about eternity
[49:05] can you say man those of you on the
[49:08] Internet I'm glad you're saying a man at
[49:09] home maybe I'll just preach through the
[49:10] camera here tonight everybody must have
[49:12] been in the Sun a little too long come
[49:14] on friends say amen to the Word of God I
[49:16] know you got masks on that shouldn't
[49:17] stop you from give me a verbal amen
[49:19] praise God you love the Lord so there's
[49:22] two types of history we know that
[49:24] there's history that's in the past
[49:26] and then we know that there's a history
[49:28] which is future history and you say
[49:31] brother Matt how can we call the future
[49:33] history
[49:34] well because it's what the Bible refers
[49:36] to as prophecy and what you under have
[49:39] to understand about prophecy is prophecy
[49:42] is also history because it's our
[49:45] happened in the mind of God now it's not
[49:48] our history but it's the history of his
[49:51] story it's already done in the mind of
[49:54] God even the Bible says the lamb that
[49:56] was slain before the foundation of the
[49:58] world already happened before the time
[50:01] event took place and so only God can
[50:05] tell future such as history and and
[50:08] Daniel what Daniel is going to see when
[50:11] you read The Book of Daniel as Daniels
[50:13] going to see into the distant future and
[50:17] what's amazing about it is that it's
[50:19] unbelievably accurate unbelievably
[50:22] accurate in fact let me go further and
[50:25] sell say this that the book that the
[50:27] accuracy let me start over and say the
[50:30] Book of Daniel is going to reveal
[50:31] something very amazing about the human
[50:34] being
[50:35] it's going to reveal it to us a
[50:37] principle something that's astounding
[50:39] about the human mind and the
[50:41] intellectual approach to God or the
[50:45] intellectual approach to spirituality
[50:48] the intellectual approach to religion if
[50:51] you study just historical commentary and
[50:55] I'm not just speaking secular if you
[50:57] study biblical commentators and biblical
[51:01] historians and you look at any Bible
[51:04] based literature you'll find out that in
[51:06] our age and in our age alone there's
[51:09] been a shift in an in the approach to
[51:13] how they treat books like the Book of
[51:16] Daniel believe it or not even the book
[51:18] of Revelation and you'll see that even
[51:21] in biblical literature that you can pick
[51:23] up from the Bible bookstore you can
[51:25] nowadays this go to Google and what
[51:28] you'll find is is that the literature
[51:30] surrounding the Bible in the category in
[51:34] two categories has drastically changed
[51:38] from what they were even just 65 years
[51:42] ago and the two categories are prophecy
[51:47] and miracles there's been a shift when a
[51:53] modern bit on a lot of this as liberal
[51:55] scholars and there's liberal Christian
[51:57] scholars as well
[51:58] and then they're taught in seminaries in
[52:01] school or brother branham call them
[52:02] cemeteries and they miracles and
[52:05] prophecies used to be considered only 65
[52:10] years ago when you read about the
[52:12] miracle and the but when you read about
[52:14] a miracle in the Bible whether it's
[52:16] Jonah whether and the well or or even
[52:19] Merton further than that Jonah or
[52:22] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego Daniel in
[52:25] the lines and you look at any of these
[52:26] miracles there was a time when when
[52:31] someone wanted the proof of the
[52:33] vindication of the Bible they would
[52:36] point to miracles that you read about in
[52:39] the Bible as almost as if they were
[52:42] supportive proofs to the accuracy or the
[52:46] divinity of the Bible and you can read
[52:49] this in literate you can read it in if
[52:51] you go back and study arthur pink you
[52:53] study matthew henry you study john gill
[52:55] look at some of these men's from the
[52:57] eighteen seventeen eighteen nineteen
[52:59] OS they would they would they were
[53:01] weren't ashamed to speak about miracles
[53:03] they also treated the the category of
[53:06] prophecies of Biblical prophecy such as
[53:09] what you find in the Book of Daniel they
[53:11] treated them with a different attitude
[53:13] miracles and prophecies were considered
[53:15] to be proofs that if someone didn't
[53:17] believe the Bible that the inspiration
[53:19] of the Bible they would say we'll just
[53:21] look at the miracles just look at Daniel
[53:24] and the Lions then just look at what
[53:26] Jesus did turning water into wine open
[53:28] and blind eyes and if you don't believe
[53:30] that look at the prophecies the accuracy
[53:33] of Daniels prophecies that has been
[53:34] fulfilled in Gentile dispensations from
[53:38] the time Daniel spoke it that's how they
[53:40] approach that that's how they looked at
[53:42] it and you even look at Christian
[53:45] apologists for the Christian faith they
[53:47] would always point to miracles and
[53:49] prophecies in the Bible that the by to
[53:51] prove that the Bible is divinely
[53:53] inspired
[53:54] but now there's been a shift and it's
[53:56] important that it happened now it
[53:58] couldn't happen a hundred years ago but
[54:01] now there's been a demonic infiltration
[54:04] into the church that's labeled the
[54:07] Christian Church there's been a demonic
[54:10] blue
[54:11] or scheme or plan and as brother
[54:14] branham's would say that they that they
[54:16] would go to church thinking they're
[54:18] worshipping God and they're worshipping
[54:20] the devil and they don't even realize it
[54:23] and the shift has happened now I could
[54:26] give you literature if you'd like it
[54:28] from biblical today modern scholars who
[54:31] say that the books that the prophecies
[54:34] in the book of Daniel were inserted
[54:37] after the Bible was written after the
[54:40] Book of Daniel was written that they
[54:42] were later added and the reason that
[54:45] they give is because it's impossible it
[54:47] could be that accurate because Daniel
[54:49] when you go into chapter 11 gives
[54:51] specifics we're gonna get into a few of
[54:53] those here tonight uh nowadays miracles
[54:56] and prophecies are just brushed under
[54:58] the rug they're swept under the rug the
[55:01] days of miracles are passed you think
[55:03] that was a statement that brother
[55:04] Branham point he didn't you'll hear it
[55:06] today the Apostolic age is over brother
[55:08] Branham makes that comment and you say
[55:10] oh that was where you know he made that
[55:13] up he didn't make that up that's
[55:14] literally said and was said to me by a
[55:18] pastor of a church here in town biggest
[55:21] one we've got Apostolic age days of the
[55:24] Apostles is over now brother Branham
[55:27] Delon contended started continuing with
[55:29] that spirit but even today the in the
[55:32] Christian world nominal Christian world
[55:35] not all believers not all people who
[55:37] profess Christians we know that that
[55:40] we're not we don't have exclusive rights
[55:42] on own truth truth is a person we don't
[55:45] have exclusive rights on that person now
[55:47] the elected seat of God is the only one
[55:49] who have something to be able to see the
[55:50] fullness of the word but there's there's
[55:52] been light some people there's people
[55:54] not in the message of the hour who loves
[55:57] the Lord as much as you love the Lord
[55:58] but nominally in a in a grand scheme of
[56:02] things miracles and prophecies are
[56:06] almost considered a handicap when trying
[56:10] to prove that the divinity of the Bible
[56:13] amazing people will say almost if you'll
[56:16] cut out the miracles and leave out the
[56:18] prophecies then I could believe a book
[56:19] like the Bible it's human intellect
[56:22] trying to understand the
[56:23] cept of God when you Jesus said unless a
[56:27] man is born of the Spirit of God he'll
[56:29] never see the kingdom of God he can't
[56:31] it's impossible and so instead of people
[56:35] believing that it's God's book and
[56:37] actually the miracles and the prophecies
[56:39] because we live in what's called the
[56:41] scientific age and everything's got to
[56:43] be proven by a microscope they've got to
[56:46] observe it they've got to be able to
[56:47] look at it and monitor it and you've got
[56:49] to test it and examine it and put it
[56:51] through their tests and and so
[56:53] scientific minded people how do they
[56:56] deal with miracles and prophecies well
[56:58] miracles are you know they treat them as
[57:00] fiction rather than fact they treat they
[57:06] treat some of the stories you read about
[57:08] as myths legends allegories all
[57:12] allegorical it's pretty dangerous to to
[57:16] treat something that God meant literally
[57:18] as allegorically it's pretty dangerous
[57:20] when you say oh it was just the greater
[57:22] good it was just the moral of the story
[57:24] but not really the story it's amazing
[57:27] this shift that's happened in our age
[57:29] and I'm preaching to you on his story
[57:31] just stay with me here Daniel and the
[57:34] Lions Den has explained a way is that
[57:36] the Lions must have just been fed right
[57:38] before Daniel was thrown in in other
[57:40] words the stories that you read about
[57:43] don't have any historical they they
[57:45] didn't really take place they they never
[57:47] really happened there's no then out well
[57:50] then well then do you not believe the
[57:51] ball of course I believe the Bible I'm
[57:53] not I'm not suggesting that I'm just
[57:55] telling you that really you can't really
[57:57] read the Bible that way you've got to
[57:59] sort of this take the spiritual meaning
[58:01] out of it you can't really treat it
[58:03] factually because we live in a
[58:05] scientific age it's not really provable
[58:07] nothing's really provable and so you
[58:09] know modern liberal scholars have
[58:12] treated these prophecies as we said and
[58:14] they said they were inserted later on so
[58:16] now we we just have to take the moral of
[58:19] the story what's the moral value and
[58:21] that's why it's pointed the Sermon on
[58:22] the mountain and the golden rule and
[58:24] that's all they take of the Ministry of
[58:26] Jesus when that wasn't even the gospel
[58:30] that this is this is this is what we
[58:34] find today is that they've taken these
[58:38] and when you look at Daniel chapter 11
[58:40] particularly and if you haven't studied
[58:42] that if anything this Wednesday night
[58:44] should do is to inspire you to go home
[58:46] and read the Book of Daniel because I
[58:47] believe it's relevant it's important
[58:49] right now you know even it was Daniel it
[58:53] was the captivity of God's people that
[58:56] stirred a man named Daniel to pick up
[59:00] the books and the scrolls and realize a
[59:03] prophecy that God's people were about to
[59:06] leave captivity in Babylon
[59:08] so it was calamity that stirred the
[59:12] heart of Daniel what should calamity do
[59:15] to us and when you look at Daniel
[59:19] chapter 11 there's over 200 specifics we
[59:25] don't have the time tonight obviously to
[59:27] get into this there's over 200 specific
[59:32] prophecies that Daniel gives just in
[59:36] chapter 11 every single one of those 200
[59:41] happens after Daniel is gone all of it
[59:46] happens
[59:46] centuries later through time and and so
[59:50] so what we understand is you have to
[59:54] make a determination as a believer I
[59:56] either believe it or I don't believe it
[59:59] and let me tell you something today
[1:00:02] friend there's a class of people called
[1:00:04] unbelievers and they are anointed to
[1:00:09] unbelief there's also a class of people
[1:00:12] who are make believers and they are
[1:00:15] anointed to make belief but there's also
[1:00:18] a class of believers and they're
[1:00:21] anointed to believe it all depends on
[1:00:24] what class you are I say I'm a believer
[1:00:26] I believe every single word of it I
[1:00:29] don't question any of it and I'm
[1:00:30] anointed to believe it every one is
[1:00:33] going to fulfill apart
[1:00:34] everyone's gonna play a role in his
[1:00:37] story everyone's got a part what part
[1:00:39] are you playing this is what God says in
[1:00:43] Isaiah 46 verse 9 for I am God and there
[1:00:47] is no other I am God there is none
[1:00:51] like me declaring the end from the
[1:00:54] beginning and from ancient times things
[1:00:59] that are not yet done that's what God
[1:01:03] says about himself he says I'm going to
[1:01:07] speak of things ancient things and he
[1:01:10] said things that haven't even happened
[1:01:11] yet and then God would anoint a man like
[1:01:14] Daniel reveal it to Daniel and Daniel
[1:01:16] would begin to speak it now it's amazing
[1:01:18] to me how many people there are that
[1:01:21] want to treat the book the Bible like
[1:01:24] this but yet they somehow still want to
[1:01:27] hold on to the Bible I just say why if
[1:01:29] you can't believe it why do you still
[1:01:31] want to hold on to it and teach it if
[1:01:34] you want to question the miracles and
[1:01:35] the prophecies and say there that
[1:01:36] apostolic age is over and revelations
[1:01:39] just really meant nothing it's just so
[1:01:41] we can all go up I'm not really sure it
[1:01:44] was just there you know either you
[1:01:47] believe there's a divine interpretation
[1:01:48] to it or then why is it there right
[1:01:54] that's what I want to ask some people
[1:01:56] sometimes you you just believe that the
[1:01:59] gospel to the world that the entire
[1:02:02] revelation of God is contained within
[1:02:04] Matthew Mark Luke and John and that's
[1:02:08] the whole gospel you said for the man is
[1:02:09] that the gospel that's part of the
[1:02:11] gospel but it's not the full counsel how
[1:02:15] does acts 1 begin the former treatise
[1:02:18] what is he referring to Luke's Gospel
[1:02:20] the former treatise that I made unto you
[1:02:23] Theophilus of all that Jesus began to do
[1:02:26] and teach began but there's got to be an
[1:02:29] ending so in other words what was it
[1:02:31] saying the Gospels were about the
[1:02:33] beginning of the ministry of Christ and
[1:02:35] everything after that will be the second
[1:02:37] part of the Ministry of Christ the
[1:02:39] kingdom of God is not just what happened
[1:02:41] in Calvary the kingdom of God is what's
[1:02:44] coming and I'm afraid too many people
[1:02:47] are living for this world we're so
[1:02:49] concerned and what's gonna happen
[1:02:50] leading up to that event I say Lord let
[1:02:53] me be concerned of what's gonna happen
[1:02:54] after that event everyone gets so locked
[1:02:57] in on Lord what's it gonna be like is
[1:03:00] this the end of the world is what's it
[1:03:01] gonna look like the guys the coming of
[1:03:03] the Lord
[1:03:03] why don't instead of asking that say
[1:03:05] what's it gonna look like after you come
[1:03:07] and clean this world and fix this world
[1:03:09] where's my place in all of that Lord
[1:03:13] because we understand the kingdom of God
[1:03:15] is not just what happened it's not just
[1:03:18] what's happening it's also what's going
[1:03:20] to happen and Daniel is all about that
[1:03:23] you know and and as we said this is the
[1:03:26] reason you have this idea in the world
[1:03:29] today that you know you can keep the
[1:03:31] Bible well hi why do you still want to
[1:03:32] hold on to the Bible well you can keep
[1:03:34] it because it has good moral values has
[1:03:36] good spiritual those same people don't
[1:03:39] realize it but they're all that is is
[1:03:40] just secularism that that well then
[1:03:43] Buddha has good values Mohammed had good
[1:03:47] good knew the Muslims have good values
[1:03:49] if it's all about good value so it's a
[1:03:52] good book just cut out the miraculous
[1:03:55] and keep the moral part just cut out the
[1:03:57] prophetic and and that's exactly what
[1:04:00] the evangelical churches done today just
[1:04:01] cut out everything give me the gospel
[1:04:03] give me the cross let me see Jesus
[1:04:05] crucified and leave me right there at
[1:04:07] the cross I'm glad I'm glad there was a
[1:04:13] word that came with clarity in our
[1:04:14] generation just live by the Ten
[1:04:17] Commandments the Sermon on the Mount the
[1:04:19] miracles just forget the prophecy and
[1:04:20] miracles and prophecies the reason
[1:04:22] people can't accept the supernatural
[1:04:25] side of the Bible is because they cannot
[1:04:27] accept God and they think they've
[1:04:32] accepted God but they haven't they've
[1:04:34] accepted into an intellectual
[1:04:37] understanding because God is not in this
[1:04:41] not of this world it's in another
[1:04:43] dimension and if you believe in God you
[1:04:45] have to believe in the supernatural can
[1:04:48] you say men so what happens is the
[1:04:51] reason people Kenny as we said they
[1:04:52] really don't accept His Word they accept
[1:04:55] a story they don't accept him they don't
[1:04:58] accept they accept the history but they
[1:05:02] don't have the revelation of the his
[1:05:04] story
[1:05:05] what is what is history it's his story
[1:05:09] all of time right now is part of his
[1:05:12] story if they believed it if they really
[1:05:16] believed
[1:05:17] that if they really believed it let me
[1:05:19] go further if we really believed it make
[1:05:22] us live different but there's a built-in
[1:05:26] reluctance inside of the human mind to
[1:05:29] accept the supernatural dimension it's a
[1:05:32] and it's not just scientists some
[1:05:35] scientist scientism just in science that
[1:05:38] believes that we live in a closed you
[1:05:39] know that's exactly how science look at
[1:05:41] it we're letting a closed universe
[1:05:42] there's nothing outside of this there's
[1:05:43] no reality beyond this it's got to be
[1:05:45] put in a test tube it's got to be
[1:05:47] examined it's got to be investigated
[1:05:48] with our instruments and our tools you
[1:05:50] know and it's it's man's reluctance to
[1:05:52] accept what they can't understand so
[1:05:58] Daniel is written and if we're gonna go
[1:06:00] just a little bit further here Daniels
[1:06:02] book is written in two halves and we
[1:06:04] covered this in Sunday school are
[1:06:06] covered again it's literally split in
[1:06:08] two just like if I was to take this
[1:06:10] Daniel the original Hebrew if you go get
[1:06:14] a Hebrew Bible the books are actual
[1:06:16] books like this the book and so Daniel
[1:06:19] would be taken and you could split
[1:06:21] Daniel into two halves like this and the
[1:06:24] first half of the Book of Daniel is all
[1:06:26] about the life of Daniel it's all the
[1:06:29] first half is all about miracles and the
[1:06:33] second half is all about prophecy about
[1:06:36] what's going to happen miracles prophecy
[1:06:40] Daniel's life what happens after Daniels
[1:06:43] life are you with me and so the other
[1:06:46] half and then what happens is the people
[1:06:49] that have trouble with the supernatural
[1:06:50] part just take the first part and they
[1:06:52] leave out the state cut off the second
[1:06:54] part that's gotta have both gotta have
[1:06:57] both halves gonna have both parts and so
[1:07:00] it's written divided up and the first if
[1:07:02] you study this the first six chapters
[1:07:04] are easy to comprehend easy to
[1:07:06] understand as we said we know the
[1:07:07] stories from Sunday school but when you
[1:07:09] go to chapter 7 and 8 and 9 and 10 and
[1:07:12] 11 and 12
[1:07:13] it takes a shift and it's harder
[1:07:15] intellectually as the Book of
[1:07:17] Revelations you go to read it and you're
[1:07:19] just can you you know without an
[1:07:21] understanding of the message you just be
[1:07:22] guessing you'd be probing like men have
[1:07:24] done for for centuries and Daniel the
[1:07:27] last half of Daniel is very much the
[1:07:29] same exact way
[1:07:30] what's amazing too about the two halves
[1:07:33] so you have one half of the Book of
[1:07:35] Daniel that's miracles and the second
[1:07:38] half this prophecy what's amazing too if
[1:07:41] you if you've had for me I even when I
[1:07:44] remember reading this and I thought my
[1:07:45] goodness it's incredible the first half
[1:07:49] of the Book of Daniel is all about him
[1:07:52] everything is about him you go and you
[1:07:55] go and read the the 7 to 12 it's all
[1:07:59] about prophecies all prophetic all
[1:08:01] what's going to happen and also chapters
[1:08:03] 1 through 6 as written in the third
[1:08:07] person the whole thing you go read
[1:08:11] Daniel and he daniel said unto the king
[1:08:14] and Daniel he said it's all the third
[1:08:16] person when you go to chapter 7 through
[1:08:18] 12 it shifts and it's all the first
[1:08:21] person I Daniel everything shifts
[1:08:26] everything changes now follow this with
[1:08:28] me here just for a moment and so
[1:08:30] everything's written I had 12 so the
[1:08:31] first half is about him let me say that
[1:08:34] again the first half is about him the
[1:08:38] second half is by him it's Daniel
[1:08:41] writing it himself as God gave him
[1:08:45] understanding Daniel's going to have
[1:08:47] this dream and so some of it has
[1:08:49] happened already some of it is happening
[1:08:53] some of it is yet to happen we know that
[1:08:56] about the book of Revelation some of it
[1:08:58] has happened some of it is happening
[1:09:01] some of it is going to happen we know
[1:09:03] that about the seven seals some of it
[1:09:05] has happened some of it all of its
[1:09:08] revealed all of its been revealed I'll
[1:09:11] try it again all of its been revealed
[1:09:15] but not but but not all of it has been
[1:09:18] fulfilled we're not we're not living
[1:09:21] thank God the sixth seal has not been
[1:09:23] fulfilled weren't still here that's
[1:09:26] their tribulation seal it hasn't taken
[1:09:28] place yet so very much the same way
[1:09:30] Daniels written the same way half as
[1:09:32] have some has happened some is happening
[1:09:34] some is going to happen first have his
[1:09:37] present second have his future and
[1:09:39] what's amazing about the first half
[1:09:42] chapter 1 through chapter 6
[1:09:44] and then chapter seven through Chapter
[1:09:46] twelve is something so unique about it
[1:09:48] that I thought was just incredible the
[1:09:51] first chapter nether you got to follow
[1:09:53] me closer you're really going to be
[1:09:55] confused here the first chapter of the
[1:09:58] book of daniel when you read it is
[1:10:01] written in the Hebrew language just
[1:10:04] catch that so the first chapter of the
[1:10:09] first half let me give you a visual here
[1:10:13] this is the first half here's the first
[1:10:16] chapter the first chapters in Hebrew and
[1:10:19] the language of the you know what was
[1:10:22] the Hebrew language it was the language
[1:10:23] of the Jews was the Hebrew the God's
[1:10:26] people
[1:10:26] it's what language that they spoke but
[1:10:29] the next five chapters the next five you
[1:10:34] go read this for your silvery study this
[1:10:36] for yourself the next five chapters are
[1:10:39] written in Aramaic what does their make
[1:10:41] it was the common language spoken by
[1:10:44] everybody now it's amazing because it's
[1:10:48] the language that we used in the ancient
[1:10:49] world by everybody the first now when
[1:10:52] you go to the second half the first
[1:10:54] chapter of the second half and I think
[1:10:58] you already guessed it the first chapter
[1:11:00] of the second half is in our Aramaic and
[1:11:03] then the last five are in Hebrew weird
[1:11:07] in Hebrew a complete shift and reversal
[1:11:10] you think this was by accident it's not
[1:11:12] by accident at all it tells you where
[1:11:15] the chapters were meant to be read they
[1:11:18] were written for Hebrews because there
[1:11:20] was a portion of the Book of Daniel that
[1:11:23] was only for Hebrews and there was a
[1:11:26] portion that was for the rest of
[1:11:28] everybody else and let me just take that
[1:11:32] a little bit further there's parts of
[1:11:34] this Bible that's for the whole world
[1:11:36] but then there's parts that are just for
[1:11:38] you there are certain parts that are
[1:11:42] written in your language and unless you
[1:11:45] speak that language you can't understand
[1:11:48] those parts that's why the believer Higa
[1:11:52] he's been given a new language a
[1:11:53] heavenly tongue
[1:11:55] a heavenly understanding and unless you
[1:11:58] have that language which only comes by
[1:12:00] the spirit you can't understand that
[1:12:02] part of the word and so it tells you
[1:12:05] where it was written you can say you can
[1:12:07] tell which parts were meant to be read
[1:12:09] widely by everybody and understood by
[1:12:12] everybody by unbelievers and which were
[1:12:14] meant to be kept only for the people of
[1:12:17] God this is exactly why the Ministry of
[1:12:19] Jesus there were parts of it that were
[1:12:22] for the whole world and then there were
[1:12:24] parts that were only for those that had
[1:12:26] eyes to see that's why the disciples say
[1:12:29] why do you speak like this he says
[1:12:30] because it's very simple the whole
[1:12:32] mystery of God is this way to them it's
[1:12:35] not given to you it's given so blessed
[1:12:38] are your eyes for they see blessed are
[1:12:40] your ears for they hear because there's
[1:12:43] things that think that God has to say
[1:12:46] that are now listen everything is part
[1:12:49] of his story the heathens part of his
[1:12:53] story the Antichrist is part of his
[1:12:57] story
[1:12:58] the fall of the world is part of his
[1:13:01] story redemptions part of his story the
[1:13:04] Brides part of his story Ages were part
[1:13:06] of his story seals were part of his
[1:13:08] story we're all a part of his story the
[1:13:11] whole world's a part of his story but
[1:13:12] what part are you fulfilling are you
[1:13:17] here what part are you fulfilling as we
[1:13:21] said even with this pandemic it's
[1:13:23] affecting everybody everybody look
[1:13:28] around you all got masks on it's
[1:13:31] affecting everybody but what part are
[1:13:35] you fulfilling what part and what way
[1:13:39] what does this mean for the believer
[1:13:40] what does it mean for the rest of the
[1:13:42] world it means something completely
[1:13:43] different
[1:13:45] God's doing something we're still here
[1:13:49] we're still here and God's doing
[1:13:52] something in the world what are you
[1:13:54] listening to what voice are you hearing
[1:13:56] what perspective are you taking are you
[1:14:00] just drumming marching to the same
[1:14:02] drummer be this foxnews marching to the
[1:14:05] drumbeat of Facebook
[1:14:08] it's got a drumbeat and I'm not just
[1:14:10] talking about the liberal drumbeat I'm
[1:14:11] talking about the conservative one too
[1:14:13] it's got a drumbeat the whole world's
[1:14:15] being drummed to a certain sound and two
[1:14:17] parties two political parties
[1:14:19] diametrically opposed to each other and
[1:14:21] they're marching to that beat that
[1:14:23] Christian world's marching to that beat
[1:14:24] but the Bible's Jesus is the words of
[1:14:27] the message come out of her my people
[1:14:29] don't be a partaker of her sins so that
[1:14:32] you don't receive her plagues you've
[1:14:35] been separated unto God that's not your
[1:14:38] message that's not your calling
[1:14:40] we may have to watch as the rest of the
[1:14:42] world goes through and friends that may
[1:14:43] get worse than coronavirus this may just
[1:14:47] be the beginning
[1:14:50] in fact I dare to say that it is it's
[1:14:53] just the beginning
[1:14:55] uuuugh ask if you you tell me the
[1:14:57] children of Israel even though they were
[1:14:59] God's people even then go though God
[1:15:01] said I've heard the cries of my people
[1:15:02] I've come down deliver them they still
[1:15:04] were there when the plague started they
[1:15:05] still were there when the blood the
[1:15:07] river was turned into blood when the
[1:15:08] frogs when that when that when the
[1:15:10] locust now they were hidden away but
[1:15:12] they were still there God had not Exodus
[1:15:15] to listen friends there's not been a
[1:15:17] third exodus yet we're still here
[1:15:18] there's there's one coming but while I'm
[1:15:21] here I want to fulfill the part of the
[1:15:24] story that I'm supposed to be fulfilling
[1:15:27] and I don't want to synchronize myself
[1:15:29] with the rest of the world let's go a
[1:15:34] little bit further we're never gonna get
[1:15:36] to our throne here tonight oh lord help
[1:15:39] me it's 8:20 I mean that lord help me
[1:15:41] got to get through this I want I want to
[1:15:43] get to something and I just
[1:15:44] it's 8:20 already can you give me just a
[1:15:47] few minutes so you can tell notice this
[1:15:51] now I'm gonna skip some of this here and
[1:15:53] I wish we had time to cover some of this
[1:15:56] but but we just don't let me just let me
[1:15:59] just look through this when you look
[1:16:00] through the historical part of Daniel
[1:16:02] you go through all the beginning we can
[1:16:04] go through each book each chapter sorry
[1:16:07] but the the the prophecy of Daniel and
[1:16:10] Daniel 11 has amazing details about
[1:16:14] great empires I show the pictured
[1:16:15] brother Caleb if you could that first
[1:16:17] one that you have there he has this
[1:16:20] amazed
[1:16:21] using details of great empires these
[1:16:24] were political kingdoms political
[1:16:27] developments we could call them that
[1:16:28] endtime powers that Daniel sees and all
[1:16:32] of these would begin to affect don't
[1:16:34] worry that you can't read the words this
[1:16:36] is the vision that daniel has of the
[1:16:38] great mammoth the great statue and he's
[1:16:42] going to see and he begins to give
[1:16:44] details about all of these empires and
[1:16:46] these political leaders and developments
[1:16:50] and endtime powers that would affect the
[1:16:53] Jews in some kind of way they would they
[1:16:55] would have a direct correlation and so
[1:16:57] the introduction of when you go and look
[1:17:00] at Daniel chapter 11 it's given when you
[1:17:03] look at this it's all of chapter 10 it
[1:17:06] begins with this in the third year of
[1:17:07] Cyrus king of Persia a message was
[1:17:10] revealed this is Daniel 10:1 he says in
[1:17:13] the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a
[1:17:15] message was revealed to Daniel whose
[1:17:18] name was called belteshazzar the message
[1:17:20] was true but the appointed time was long
[1:17:24] and he understood the message and had
[1:17:29] understanding if you're not reading that
[1:17:31] you can read that I Daniel chapter 10
[1:17:33] verse 1 I'm gonna read it again I
[1:17:34] thought you were reading it there with
[1:17:36] me let's listen and the third year of
[1:17:38] Cyrus king of Persia message was
[1:17:40] revealed a message was revealed to
[1:17:43] Daniel listen to this whose name was
[1:17:45] called about the Shazzer the message was
[1:17:47] true there thank you brother the message
[1:17:50] was true but the time appointed
[1:17:54] now here's time the message was true
[1:17:56] revelation was true but the time wasn't
[1:17:59] yet he says but the time appointed was
[1:18:02] long and he understood the thing and had
[1:18:07] understanding of the vision and so
[1:18:11] chapter when you read through chapter
[1:18:12] one and chapter two we can come all the
[1:18:15] way to chapter two put the slide of you
[1:18:17] could brother Caleb back up and Daniel
[1:18:19] has this great dream of this massive
[1:18:22] monument this statue
[1:18:24] anny any Nebuchadnezzar has this dream
[1:18:26] and it's not games Nebuchadnezzar's
[1:18:28] dream and he sees this great statue he
[1:18:31] calls all of his leaders all of the whiz
[1:18:33] of the world at that time you know he
[1:18:35] was a great king had a great Kingdom if
[1:18:37] you see pictures of ancient Babylon it
[1:18:40] was just looks like what exactly what
[1:18:43] you would imagine New York City or some
[1:18:45] massive city would be in biblical times
[1:18:48] it was just stretched freh was a great
[1:18:51] flat a great plain there was no Hills
[1:18:53] there was no mountains it was a plain
[1:18:56] you could look at it today it's flat as
[1:18:58] a pancake this is exactly why when he
[1:19:01] Daniel or Nebuchadnezzar here X the
[1:19:03] golden image and it stood 90 feet high
[1:19:06] you could see it across and you put that
[1:19:08] in the flat and put that in the
[1:19:09] mountains no one could see it put it on
[1:19:10] a flat land 90 feet high everybody can
[1:19:13] see it and so so Dan Nebuchadnezzar has
[1:19:17] this dream and he's troubled and he
[1:19:20] brings all of his counselors and his
[1:19:22] wise men they tell him give me the
[1:19:24] interpretation of the dream and and they
[1:19:27] now what what happened was is that they
[1:19:29] couldn't they couldn't not tell him what
[1:19:32] the interpretation was so they bring
[1:19:33] Daniel in and I think it was I don't I
[1:19:36] don't remember if it was this this dream
[1:19:38] but Nebuchadnezzar had a dream I think
[1:19:40] it was the Statue and he couldn't
[1:19:41] remember he not only did he tell his
[1:19:43] counselors tell me the interpretation he
[1:19:45] also said I don't remember what I
[1:19:46] dreamed so tell me what I dreamed and
[1:19:48] then tell me the interpretation talking
[1:19:50] about a two tricks man they can maybe
[1:19:52] pull one they couldn't do - Daniel did
[1:19:54] both said this is what you dreamed and
[1:19:57] this is the meaning of the dream and so
[1:19:59] Daniel begins to tell him this dream of
[1:20:01] this giant statue and if you go down
[1:20:04] look there on your screen
[1:20:06] if you go down you'll notice that the
[1:20:08] quality of the material is decreasing
[1:20:13] it goes from gold notice this here it's
[1:20:16] a decreasing starts with gold all the
[1:20:19] way from gold and then it moves down
[1:20:21] into silver a little bit less quality
[1:20:24] and material and then it moves from
[1:20:26] silver to iron little less quality than
[1:20:28] silver then from iron it's going to move
[1:20:31] to clay and the interpretation of the
[1:20:34] dream is that the golden head daniel
[1:20:37] says is you O king this is the kingdom
[1:20:41] of Babylon the Babylonians and Daniel
[1:20:45] begins to interpret this dream
[1:20:47] and he's fixed and then a notice here
[1:20:49] it's gonna go through time Daniel's
[1:20:51] going to say this is you O king the
[1:20:52] golden head is Nebuchadnezzar but this
[1:20:57] whole figure is an unveiling of future
[1:21:01] coming empires now notice they're all on
[1:21:06] the statue of a man a strong gray statue
[1:21:09] a giant spoke of strength that the human
[1:21:14] empires and human kingdoms will raise up
[1:21:18] Babylon being the first the golden head
[1:21:21] a great Empire great superpower and and
[1:21:26] he says it's you it's your kingdom it's
[1:21:29] this great strength of your kingdom but
[1:21:32] the the entire figure is a portrait of
[1:21:36] of kingdoms that are coming a minds not
[1:21:40] saying gold and so the so that the
[1:21:42] golden head there the golden head it was
[1:21:45] it was a it was a it was a the
[1:21:47] Babylonian Kingdom noticed this here and
[1:21:49] so this whole figure is the unveiling of
[1:21:52] future empires and each one of those
[1:21:55] empires would replace Nebuchadnezzar
[1:21:59] this is what Daniel reveals to him
[1:22:01] you're going to be replaced by another
[1:22:03] King I know you don't like to hear that
[1:22:05] I'm sure he didn't but then guess what
[1:22:08] that Kings gonna get replaced by another
[1:22:09] empire and then that Empire is gonna get
[1:22:11] replaced by another Empire and then that
[1:22:13] Empire is gonna get replaced by another
[1:22:15] empire this is all human kingdoms all
[1:22:17] human empires and it's all his story or
[1:22:22] what the world calls history it's all
[1:22:26] going to happen in history and so
[1:22:30] Babylon is going to be replaced notice
[1:22:34] this here the gold the silver the brass
[1:22:35] the iron legs the clay the iron and clay
[1:22:38] mixed in the feet so what you'll see
[1:22:40] there and so Babylon is going to be
[1:22:42] replaced by the Medes and the Persians
[1:22:44] under a nother leader named Cyrus and
[1:22:48] also Durai asur Darius and and these are
[1:22:51] other this is the Kingdom that's going
[1:22:53] to replace Nebuchadnezzar and notice
[1:22:55] this here you
[1:22:57] go look historically this is this is the
[1:22:59] interpretation of the dream the kingdom
[1:23:01] of Cyrus and Darius was never as great
[1:23:03] as Nebuchadnezzar his kingdom because it
[1:23:06] was a different quality it was never his
[1:23:08] grant it stood in its glory but it was
[1:23:10] never as glorious as when Nebuchadnezzar
[1:23:11] was there that golden head and so they
[1:23:14] would be followed after that by the
[1:23:15] Greek Empire and and and that Greek
[1:23:18] Empire that that that Grecian Empire you
[1:23:21] notice there in the midsection it would
[1:23:23] be that Greek Empire under a man named
[1:23:25] Alexander the Great would be part of
[1:23:27] that greek empire that would conquer and
[1:23:30] he would rule he would be a great man
[1:23:32] who would conquer the Persians and the
[1:23:34] Medes and then Daniel says then a little
[1:23:38] bit lower than that the Greeks would be
[1:23:39] replaced by the Romans and that's why it
[1:23:43] was in the legs because the legs speak
[1:23:45] of military and Rome was known by its
[1:23:47] military the the iron legs of Rome that
[1:23:50] it was that was his force that was its
[1:23:53] power that was its strength this Roman
[1:23:56] Empire and you can see why they would be
[1:23:58] legs of iron it represents a great army
[1:24:00] Rome was known by that great army and
[1:24:03] then it goes further and they would be
[1:24:04] followed by a mixture of that clay and
[1:24:08] iron but then Daniel sees something else
[1:24:11] go to the next slide
[1:24:12] Daniel sees a stone that's taken q-not
[1:24:17] Hugh it's hewn out of the mountain not
[1:24:19] by men's hands
[1:24:20] was it hewn by man's hands and he says
[1:24:23] in that stone Daniel sees that stone
[1:24:25] comes and it crashes into the statue and
[1:24:29] the statue now what is the statue
[1:24:31] representing Oh human empires and all
[1:24:37] human kingdoms and all of their glory
[1:24:39] and all of their power and all of their
[1:24:41] might we know that even after that other
[1:24:43] empires Gentile empires would raise them
[1:24:45] it was it wasn't just speaking of did it
[1:24:48] went in with the Romans but others human
[1:24:51] empires have risen up there's others
[1:24:53] human kingdoms and political moves and
[1:24:55] political powers America is a superpower
[1:24:57] today well I wasn't always that way one
[1:25:02] day we were we the great shining light
[1:25:05] to the world was London maybe before
[1:25:08] that it was Great Britain maybe
[1:25:10] for that was France but now America
[1:25:12] becomes a superpower a super Empire and
[1:25:16] great military strength but he sees this
[1:25:19] and God gives a warning to never can
[1:25:22] either but it's not just going to be to
[1:25:24] Nebuchadnezzar it's going to be words
[1:25:25] that ring eternally true and Daniel
[1:25:29] warns Nebuchadnezzar and gives him a
[1:25:31] warning and this is the simple warning
[1:25:32] God says I'm in charge I know all these
[1:25:39] men are gonna think they're leading and
[1:25:40] they're in charge is all their strength
[1:25:41] and all their power and all their glory
[1:25:42] and all their great pomp and power but
[1:25:45] God says but ultimately you're just
[1:25:47] pawns on the chessboard and I'll move my
[1:25:50] pieces or I want to move my pieces and
[1:25:53] God says what it what is the entire
[1:25:55] story that God is sovereign over all
[1:25:59] human kingdoms let me say this God is
[1:26:04] sovereign over this human Kingdom that
[1:26:06] we have here today he's still in control
[1:26:09] and he says I'm in charge the whole of
[1:26:12] Daniel this is what God was saying if I
[1:26:15] calls the caifa Kingdom rises it's
[1:26:18] because I caused it to rise and if a
[1:26:21] kingdom Falls it's because I caused it
[1:26:24] to fall
[1:26:25] I didn't God say that I can say to one
[1:26:28] nation and and build it up and he said
[1:26:31] then I can take that same nation if they
[1:26:32] don't repent I can destroy them he was
[1:26:34] saying all nations that come all nations
[1:26:37] that go kingdoms come kingdoms go but
[1:26:40] it's God who decides when and it's God
[1:26:44] who decides how the whole world's want
[1:26:49] to know man what's Trump gonna do to us
[1:26:50] what's Trump gonna do oh man what's he
[1:26:52] what's he's just we got that guy in
[1:26:54] there we got to get him out so the
[1:26:55] Liberals are doing everything they can
[1:26:57] to get him out everything they'll go to
[1:26:58] any measure to get him out cuz they're
[1:27:00] so worried what's he gonna do what they
[1:27:03] don't realize is there's not that it has
[1:27:04] nothing to do with what Trump's gonna do
[1:27:06] it's what your hope is gonna do cuz when
[1:27:09] the world this world economy this world
[1:27:12] system will only fall when God says it's
[1:27:14] time it's time and Trump can't mess it
[1:27:18] up
[1:27:19] Obama everyone was worried the
[1:27:20] Republicans were worried Obama's oh no
[1:27:22] Obama
[1:27:23] oh no what's it doing to Social Security
[1:27:25] oh no what sir everybody's so concerned
[1:27:28] about man's kingdom gods this is the
[1:27:30] lesson Daniel teaches us you may think
[1:27:32] you're in control of something but I am
[1:27:34] sovereign I am supreme and I'm in
[1:27:38] control and all of it is his story
[1:27:47] history is his story and God has said
[1:27:54] I'll bring other empires after you
[1:27:56] Nebuchadnezzar mm-hmm no raise up
[1:27:58] they'll be great they'll gradually
[1:28:00] notice this gradually they'll become
[1:28:03] weaker gradually there's a weakening and
[1:28:06] human kingdoms are getting weaker and
[1:28:09] weaker weaker sinner sinner sinner more
[1:28:13] shallow than they've ever been before we
[1:28:15] should be able to recognize that here
[1:28:17] today our economy the good the dollar
[1:28:19] just immediately plummets stock markets
[1:28:21] crashed the whole world's going crazy
[1:28:23] that's how fragile it is st. 2019 that
[1:28:30] was just a few months ago I think
[1:28:35] January 2020 thanks February 2020 it
[1:28:39] wasn't till March suddenly just that
[1:28:41] fast March April May June July or in
[1:28:46] July that quick and all of the security
[1:28:50] and trust that everyone's put in this
[1:28:52] this Empire and this Kingdom lost just
[1:28:56] like that it's all history it's all his
[1:29:00] story human kingdoms with less and less
[1:29:03] and less but Daniels says but there's
[1:29:06] coming a kingdom that's gonna destroy
[1:29:08] and God's gonna set up a kingdom one day
[1:29:11] and it's going to destroy all human
[1:29:13] kingdoms now they're all profounder
[1:29:16] they're all patterned after that Kingdom
[1:29:20] but they're imperfect they're a
[1:29:21] perversion of what's coming all kings
[1:29:25] were a perversion of one king one
[1:29:30] sovereign one supreme we can go further
[1:29:34] into this into chapter five you go all
[1:29:36] the way through
[1:29:37] and and it's 8:30 already so I got to
[1:29:39] get through this but now we're just
[1:29:41] gonna have to put a put of Paul's there
[1:29:42] I want to I don't just want to dismiss
[1:29:45] this there's too much here we're at 8:34
[1:29:48] and I just want to get to something here
[1:29:50] so before we do I want to I wanted this
[1:29:53] fast-forward put that impulse here for a
[1:29:55] moment fast-forward all the way to today
[1:29:56] to this kingdom that we have here today
[1:29:58] to the world the world system that is
[1:30:02] shaking quaking
[1:30:04] the whole world's riveting and rocking
[1:30:06] and what I worried about another what
[1:30:08] about another wave I read a report today
[1:30:09] a new fear that they have as uh doctors
[1:30:13] realize a new fear of a second and a
[1:30:16] second disease second disease Darren
[1:30:21] Darren what so what could we do with two
[1:30:23] what would happen they they've gotten to
[1:30:25] thinking about those they though you
[1:30:26] know what what's good what would happen
[1:30:27] right now
[1:30:28] if suddenly some other disease some
[1:30:31] other some other a virus comes up that
[1:30:34] we don't have an answer for and we're
[1:30:36] dealing with two at the same time then
[1:30:38] what man's mind just goes and then that
[1:30:44] the the headline said doctors are in or
[1:30:46] in realize a new fear what do we do
[1:30:49] what's gonna happen let me tell you
[1:30:52] Isaiah prophesize of this and Isaiah 24
[1:30:55] 1 you don't have to turn we can we can
[1:30:58] get on the screen if they want they God
[1:31:00] he says and this is this is where it
[1:31:02] starts starts all the way in the Old
[1:31:03] Testament and God says in Isaiah 24 and
[1:31:06] verse 1 hey Isaiah begins to prophesy
[1:31:09] and he says that that there's going to
[1:31:11] be a rise up there's going to be a
[1:31:13] shaking that God says I'm going to shake
[1:31:15] the entire world and Isaiah begins to
[1:31:17] prophesy he says behold the Lord maketh
[1:31:20] the earth empty and turneth it upside
[1:31:23] down and scatter if it abroad the
[1:31:27] inhabitants thereof this is verse 11
[1:31:30] where the Calum of Isaiah 24 oh joy is
[1:31:33] gone it says all joy Isaiah says all joy
[1:31:36] is darker now this is a prophecy this is
[1:31:37] prophetic he says I mean he says it's
[1:31:40] gonna oh joy is gone the mirth of the
[1:31:43] land is gone verse 13 when thus it shall
[1:31:46] be in the midst of the people there
[1:31:48] shall be as
[1:31:49] shaking of an olive tree God says I'm
[1:31:52] gonna shake it
[1:31:53] this is prophetic in Isaiah I'm gonna
[1:31:56] shake it as the shaking of an olive tree
[1:31:58] and as the gleaning grapes when the
[1:32:00] vintage is done and so I'm gonna shake
[1:32:03] it till all the fruit falls off of it
[1:32:06] till everything that they have on the
[1:32:07] tree is off I'm gonna shake it to
[1:32:09] nothing
[1:32:10] this is prophetic here in verse 18 he
[1:32:12] says for the windows from on higher open
[1:32:15] the foundations of the earth to shake
[1:32:18] the earth has moved exceedingly the
[1:32:21] earth shall reel to and fro and shall be
[1:32:25] removed notice this he says flee from
[1:32:29] the knows of fear shall fall into the
[1:32:30] pit he that cometh out of the midst of
[1:32:31] the shall we take him in the snare
[1:32:33] that what verse is that brother Cain of
[1:32:35] verse 18 perfect go to verse 19 the
[1:32:38] earth has suddenly broken down the earth
[1:32:40] is clean dissolved the earth is moved
[1:32:42] exceedingly now this is prophetic of of
[1:32:44] the end time and verse 20 go to the next
[1:32:48] verse for the Caleb he says the earth
[1:32:49] shall reel to and fro like a drunkard
[1:32:51] and shall be removed like a cottage like
[1:32:55] a cottage the earth shall be removed
[1:32:58] like a cottage I've got to thinking
[1:33:02] about that thought this is how this is
[1:33:04] the greatness of God the earth is just
[1:33:07] like a little house like a little
[1:33:10] cottage and then that little bitty tiny
[1:33:12] tiny cottage is a is a man named Donald
[1:33:14] Trump who thinks he's in control of
[1:33:16] everything and then over in the house is
[1:33:18] Nancy Pelosi and she thinks she's in
[1:33:20] control it's just a little cottage it's
[1:33:22] a little bitty house
[1:33:23] God says foot you're done and you're
[1:33:26] done and God says I'll shake it all I'll
[1:33:30] shake heavens and I'll shake earth he
[1:33:32] says it'll reel to and fro every rule I
[1:33:34] get caught is a transgression there if
[1:33:35] she'll be heavy upon it and it shall
[1:33:37] fall and not rise again it's going to
[1:33:43] shake it so bad God begins to proclaim
[1:33:45] and says I'm gonna shake it it's I'm
[1:33:47] gonna shake it like a cottage and he
[1:33:49] says an inch and it shall rise it shall
[1:33:51] fall and it shall not rise again notice
[1:33:56] this here this prophecy and this is this
[1:33:58] is this
[1:33:59] Ezequiel now speaking in ezekiel 38
[1:34:01] verse 20 and this is god this is this is
[1:34:04] Ezekiel prophesied of the end of the
[1:34:06] world and he says he says it will shake
[1:34:10] the fury will arise when we shake all
[1:34:13] the men that are upon the face of the
[1:34:14] earth shall shake at my presence and the
[1:34:17] mountains shall be thrown down and the
[1:34:20] steep places fall and every wall shall
[1:34:23] fall to the ground every wall and I will
[1:34:27] be known in the eyes of many nations and
[1:34:31] they shall know that i am the lord you
[1:34:39] know further than that Joel Joel chapter
[1:34:41] 3 verse 16 the Lord also shall roar out
[1:34:43] of Zion and utter his voice from
[1:34:45] Jerusalem and the heavens and the earth
[1:34:47] shall shake but the Lord will be the
[1:34:49] hope of his people is that the hope of
[1:34:51] his people
[1:34:53] when the whole world shaking where is
[1:34:55] your hope let's try that again when the
[1:34:59] whole world is shaking where is your
[1:35:01] hope where is your hope today is it in
[1:35:05] the white house I hope not is that in
[1:35:07] the government I hope not is it in your
[1:35:09] bank account
[1:35:10] I hope not it better be in Christ when
[1:35:14] the whole world is shaking where is your
[1:35:16] hope this is notice what Joel says here
[1:35:18] he says but the Lord will be the hope of
[1:35:21] his people and the strength of this is
[1:35:24] Joel 3 verse 16 brother Caleb and the
[1:35:27] strength of his children the strength of
[1:35:31] the children of Israel the Lord shall
[1:35:33] wrought of Zion utter his voice drew
[1:35:34] some heaven desert south shake but what
[1:35:37] the Lord but the Lord I said Lord though
[1:35:40] the world shaken right now whole world
[1:35:43] shaken but you're my strength you're my
[1:35:49] hope the whole worlds swaying it's
[1:35:52] rocking we know it goes further than
[1:35:54] this we could read it in Haggai chapter
[1:35:56] 2 verse 6 for thus saith the Lord of
[1:35:59] Hosts yet once it is a little while and
[1:36:01] I will shake the heavens now you know
[1:36:03] who Jesus no no you notice who Hebrews
[1:36:06] was Paul was speaking of when he says
[1:36:08] once more I'll shake heaven this is who
[1:36:11] he was referring to
[1:36:12] Jia's prophecy for thus saith the lord
[1:36:14] of hosts yet once it is a little while
[1:36:16] and I will shake the heavens and the
[1:36:19] earth and the sea and the dry land and
[1:36:25] verse seven brother Caleb and he says
[1:36:28] and I will shake all nations and the
[1:36:31] desire of all nations shall come and I
[1:36:34] will fill this house with glory saith
[1:36:37] the Lord of Hosts now let's read Hebrews
[1:36:39] chapter 12 verse 26 yet once more I
[1:36:43] shake not the Earth only but also heaven
[1:36:49] that only notice this Hebrews chapter 12
[1:36:52] yes whose voice then shook the earth but
[1:36:54] now with promise yay once more I shake
[1:36:57] not of the earth only but also what we
[1:36:58] just read in Haggai verse 27 brother
[1:37:01] Caleb the next verse and this word yet
[1:37:03] once more signify through removing of
[1:37:05] those things that are shaken as of
[1:37:06] things that are made that those things
[1:37:08] which cannot be shaken may remain what
[1:37:14] did the Lord do news first coming in his
[1:37:17] first coming he brought salvation to
[1:37:18] people he saved people and he's still
[1:37:23] saving people but brother Branham said
[1:37:25] in the book of life wasn't just people
[1:37:26] it was also all creation and all of the
[1:37:30] earth and so he says what's he gonna
[1:37:32] have to do he's gonna have to send it
[1:37:34] through a nuclear holocaust just the
[1:37:36] same way that you're born again by the
[1:37:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost by the fire of
[1:37:40] God brother Branham said all the
[1:37:42] atmosphere will catch on fire what's it
[1:37:44] doing it's rid of itself of sin ridding
[1:37:47] itself of man who's destroyed the earth
[1:37:49] and God says I'm coming the second time
[1:37:52] not just to redeem my people I'm also
[1:37:55] gonna redeem the earth I'm also going to
[1:37:57] redeem creation and I'm part of creation
[1:38:00] you're part of creation and if I'm part
[1:38:03] of the earth I'm gonna be redeemed with
[1:38:04] the earth are you here tonight still and
[1:38:08] so God says I'm going to shake
[1:38:10] everything I'm going to shake everything
[1:38:15] all nations whole world whole world
[1:38:18] leader what we're seeing today right now
[1:38:25] is the world being shaken systems
[1:38:29] governments world leaders shaken Church
[1:38:33] world
[1:38:33] shaken the bride the believers shaken
[1:38:38] when the world shakes you shake Jesus
[1:38:42] said they'll shake he says but there are
[1:38:44] some things that even after the shaking
[1:38:46] they'll still remain the difference is
[1:38:49] is that after the world's done shaken
[1:38:51] and God's done shaking it there's only
[1:38:53] gonna be one thing left and that's God's
[1:38:57] people
[1:38:58] that's God's family I want to say Lord
[1:39:02] let me remain let me remain in the midst
[1:39:08] of all the shaking the Lord shakes and
[1:39:12] and and we've seen this throughout
[1:39:14] history we could go through a list and I
[1:39:17] don't want to do that just to save time
[1:39:18] we're already running out of time here
[1:39:21] but you can just go back in your mind
[1:39:23] before this pandemic that we have right
[1:39:25] now just go back in your mind just years
[1:39:27] before that you'll start remembering
[1:39:30] 9/11 planes crashing into the World
[1:39:34] Trade Centers what was that it was it
[1:39:36] was more of the result of sin and the
[1:39:38] and the shaking of the world and watch
[1:39:42] what look at the shift that happened
[1:39:44] even that we gave up even even as
[1:39:47] American citizen you gave up liberties
[1:39:49] at 9/11 you think you're giving up
[1:39:52] liberties now this isn't the first time
[1:39:54] you've killed people has given up
[1:39:55] liberties they've been given up their
[1:39:56] liberties and and and then after 9/11
[1:40:00] you have you have Hurricane Katrina you
[1:40:02] remember that
[1:40:03] Oh does anybody remember hurricane raise
[1:40:07] your hand if you were good I'm glad that
[1:40:09] wasn't a dream I had that really
[1:40:10] happened Hurricane Katrina
[1:40:12] uuugh you remember the hurt the
[1:40:14] earthquake that happened in Japan and a
[1:40:16] tsunami came and white almost wiped out
[1:40:19] all of Japan remember that it's like a
[1:40:23] it's like a chain reaction and when one
[1:40:25] thing one event start then just another
[1:40:27] one happened and then happens and then
[1:40:29] an earthquake and then a hurricane then
[1:40:31] a storm and now hurricanes are getting
[1:40:33] worse more than they've ever before
[1:40:35] we've lived here let me just let me just
[1:40:37] be a witness here for a moment twenty
[1:40:38] plus years it's only in the last three
[1:40:42] is it now three four years that we've
[1:40:45] started to actually be affected by
[1:40:47] hurricanes that come to Beaufort you
[1:40:49] think that's an accident I you might I
[1:40:51] don't you think it's that you you you
[1:40:55] notice what happens the entire world
[1:40:56] system just and then right before this
[1:40:58] you have North Korea and and we've every
[1:41:01] one's in a panic over what Kim Jong
[1:41:03] moons gonna do in the world's gonna go
[1:41:04] into we're gonna be in a nuclear war and
[1:41:07] then that was just like a little shaking
[1:41:10] and then it calms down and then oh we
[1:41:14] get back to normal and everyone's back
[1:41:15] to normal life and going about life and
[1:41:17] then right after that you have the the
[1:41:20] conflict in Syria and then a jetliner is
[1:41:24] blown up in Syria we're bombing Syria
[1:41:26] and we're wondered are we going to go
[1:41:27] into war with Syria and then you know
[1:41:33] what the reason I'm doing this is
[1:41:34] because sometimes we forget the world
[1:41:36] was falling apart before coronavirus the
[1:41:41] world's been shaking my brother my
[1:41:43] sister maybe this is what you we needed
[1:41:45] as believers to finally get us out of
[1:41:47] the slumber that some of us are in okay
[1:41:51] get us out of the slumber that we're in
[1:41:53] together and and sometimes God has to
[1:41:57] send certain things and certain things
[1:41:59] happen like this and suddenly we want to
[1:42:01] get oh you know oh what's going on oh
[1:42:03] you know I wish this whole thing else
[1:42:05] just a hoax and this ain't a hoax my
[1:42:06] brother my sister you know I I don't I'm
[1:42:11] not gonna go into conspiracy theory
[1:42:15] because that's what it is it's a theory
[1:42:16] and conspiracy theory does one thing it
[1:42:18] leads to more theories a lot more it has
[1:42:21] a all the car you watch any conspiracy
[1:42:23] and I'm not not just downing conspiracy
[1:42:25] theory videos I've watched a lot of them
[1:42:27] you know what I've done it's a lot of
[1:42:28] them you know what I do at the end I go
[1:42:30] Wow could it be maybe it could be you
[1:42:37] know what you're left with another
[1:42:39] theory another question mark more
[1:42:41] questions than you had before and and so
[1:42:46] notice this here follow follow this just
[1:42:49] here with me just for a moment what
[1:42:52] not now suddenly a pandemic now
[1:42:54] coronavirus and then we certain to that
[1:42:57] and everyone's thinking oh my goodness
[1:42:58] what's happening what's going to happen
[1:42:59] and could this be this is that the
[1:43:00] tribulation no it's not the tribulation
[1:43:02] then what is it it's I love the way
[1:43:04] brother Tim Pruett said it said it one
[1:43:06] of them in my opinion one of the best
[1:43:07] ways he said that it's like a he said
[1:43:09] you ever watched and you sat in a in a
[1:43:11] field and he said and looked way off in
[1:43:13] the distance you see a storm that's
[1:43:14] brewing that's coming you suddenly
[1:43:15] noticed dark clouds brewing and it's not
[1:43:18] here yet but it's in the distance and
[1:43:19] you're watching it and you can hear the
[1:43:22] Thunder you can see the lightning you're
[1:43:24] still in the sunshine but it's off in
[1:43:25] the distance and and that's what we
[1:43:28] watched and then it looked like we were
[1:43:29] going to come out of it and now suddenly
[1:43:30] we're all at church and only 10% of our
[1:43:33] congregation here and and the whole ten
[1:43:36] percent that's here we're in masks and
[1:43:38] people are wondering is we're gonna
[1:43:40] close church doors we're not gonna be
[1:43:41] ever gonna know what's gonna happen
[1:43:43] what's gonna happen and and and there's
[1:43:47] there's a lot more questions than
[1:43:48] answers and it's we say for the man what
[1:43:51] is it
[1:43:52] this is what I see behold I'll shake
[1:43:54] heavens and I'll shake earth not only
[1:43:57] earth uh not only the earth but also the
[1:43:59] heavens too and what's going to continue
[1:44:01] to happen as a shaking and more of a
[1:44:03] shaking I just say Lord let it shake but

[1:44:08] but let me remain give me something that
[1:44:11] I'm glad I have something and let me say
[1:44:13] Lord let my faith let my assurance let
[1:44:17] my consolation be based upon your word
[1:44:19] and not in any idea of a pull a
[1:44:22] politician or idea from some person or
[1:44:25] some church leader let my foundation be
[1:44:29] based in the word because we don't know
[1:44:32] what's happening we don't know what's
[1:44:34] going to happen next but here's my

[1:46:23] I'm about to tell you because I've told
[1:46:25] some men at a prayer group back in
[1:46:28] December second or third week of
[1:46:29] December perfect I want to share three
[1:46:31] specific dreams that I've had recently
[1:46:34] going back to December 2 that I've had
[1:46:36] this week both both Monday and last
[1:46:39] night Monday Tuesday night because I
[1:46:42] believe number one they are prophetic
[1:46:44] the first one that I had has kind of
[1:46:46] explicitly true based on the events of
[1:46:49] March through June which we're living
[1:46:52] and I do not claim to be a prophet by
[1:46:55] any means I understand those some dreams
[1:46:57] and visions by their nature have a
[1:46:59] prophet at Tennessee to them but I do
[1:47:01] believe I've seen things both that have
[1:47:03] happened as relevant by the first dream
[1:47:06] that I had and some things that I've
[1:47:07] seen recently so you can take what I'm
[1:47:09] about to say with a grain of salt
[1:47:11] you can pray about it you can think
[1:47:12] about it but I believe that I have a
[1:47:14] warning for the kind
[1:47:16] a warning for rural America a rule a
[1:47:21] warning for America overall here's what
[1:47:25] happened back in December I will had a
[1:47:27] dream and in that dream I saw a calendar
[1:47:30] starting January 2020 and it was being
[1:47:34] flipped then I saw January I saw
[1:47:36] February I saw March and when March came
[1:47:39] up the hand held that and I saw the
[1:47:41] thing that finger underlined the month
[1:47:43] of March and then tap it three times so
[1:47:47] underlined the month of March tapped it
[1:47:49] three times so to me it was emphasis
[1:47:50] something's gonna happen in March and
[1:47:53] then I saw April May June and when June
[1:47:57] came the hand underlined June again and
[1:48:00] tapped it three times then in the vision
[1:48:04] I saw people marching I saw protests
[1:48:08] I saw people wearing masks I saw lines
[1:48:10] going into hospitals
[1:48:11] I saw typical medical doctors with
[1:48:15] needles or syringes I saw people on
[1:48:18] ventilators I saw people who were very
[1:48:20] very sick very very ill I saw newspaper
[1:48:23] headlines trumpeting thousands of people
[1:48:26] getting sick
[1:48:26] I saw ambulances just flying down roads
[1:48:30] and then I saw I saw cities on fire I
[1:48:33] saw buildings being burned
[1:48:34] I saw protesters with masks I saw people
[1:48:39] who were had their fists in the air
[1:48:40] people who were yelling and screaming
[1:48:42] angry is at just at the world
[1:48:44] I saw courthouses I saw state houses
[1:48:48] surround that I saw people who were man
[1:48:50] at the world I saw I saw a gun shotgun
[1:48:53] specifically put in the air held like
[1:48:55] this and I saw barriers within cities
[1:49:00] I told several men in my church about
[1:49:03] this and I can confirm who those men
[1:49:05] were and they'll confirm that what I'm
[1:49:06] telling you is what I told them I saw
[1:49:08] absolute chaos and the other thing I saw
[1:49:10] was vultures flying over large cities
[1:49:14] not just the ones that were burning but
[1:49:16] I saw vultures flying over the cities
[1:49:18] and I saw smoke rising and I saw I saw
[1:49:21] people fearful I saw people terrified I
[1:49:24] saw people inside their homes and
[1:49:26] looking out the windows
[1:49:28] of the windows and have with guns in
[1:49:29] their hands because there was absolute
[1:49:31] fear then I heard the words brace
[1:49:35] herself embrace yourself so since
[1:49:38] December I've been hearing those words
[1:49:39] brace herself brace herself January
[1:49:44] February came didn't seemed too much I
[1:49:47] reminded the men of the dream and then
[1:49:48] in March boom Cobin nineteen yet and
[1:49:51] things started setting down churches
[1:49:53] were shut down business was shut down
[1:49:54] the economy shut down then we began to
[1:49:57] see the protests starting in might in
[1:49:59] May in Minneapolis and all those things
[1:50:01] began to go on so where we are at the
[1:50:03] end of the primary election here in
[1:50:04] Kentucky and now there's talk of more
[1:50:07] shutdowns I just heard the governor talk
[1:50:10] about schools opening back up and things
[1:50:12] of that nature but the things that I saw
[1:50:15] in a dream a vision back in December are
[1:50:18] the same things that I watched in the
[1:50:20] news almost every day since March
[1:50:22] through June all this time I kept
[1:50:26] hearing brace yourself brace yourself
[1:50:29] I spent time in prayer I spend time in
[1:50:31] the word I'm a pastor and it's not just
[1:50:33] my job it's something that I enjoy doing
[1:50:35] I love doing and I'm very interested in
[1:50:36] the news around the world
[1:50:37] I read 40 newspapers a day from all
[1:50:40] around the world I keep up with news and
[1:50:43] other parts of the nation's better than
[1:50:46] sometimes that I hear here because it's
[1:50:48] hard to know who to trust
[1:50:49] but I get news from all over the world
[1:50:51] all around the world from both liberal
[1:50:53] and conservative sources
[1:50:55] I'm very well-read I'm very
[1:50:57] understanding of how nations work
[1:50:59] travelled quite a bit and I'm not just
[1:51:01] making these things that I can confirm
[1:51:03] what I have said and with that in mind
[1:51:05] on Monday night I had another dream and
[1:51:08] it woke me from my bed I made notes
[1:51:10] about it I shot some video myself just
[1:51:12] making sure I can remember but here's
[1:51:15] what I saw I saw a calendar start with
[1:51:17] the calendar and as I was having this
[1:51:20] the calendar was up a white figure
[1:51:22] appeared and to me it was it was a
[1:51:27] representing God the Holy Spirit
[1:51:29] something pure something right just
[1:51:31] something true something holy because
[1:51:32] there was nothing nothing sinister about
[1:51:35] it nothing evil but I heard the voice
[1:51:37] say part 2 part 2 and I saw
[1:51:42] you go up I saw July I saw August and
[1:51:45] then I saw September and I saw the
[1:51:47] finger underneath the word September I
[1:51:50] liked emphasizing it and tapped it three
[1:51:52] times and then I saw October come up and
[1:51:56] then I saw November and this is when it
[1:51:59] got real to me in the dream I think the
[1:52:01] intensity accorded my Fitbit when I woke
[1:52:04] up my heart rate was about 180 so that
[1:52:07] was Monday night
[1:52:08] there's also night that I woke up not
[1:52:10] feeling very well at all I was up during
[1:52:12] the night not feeling well but anyway
[1:52:14] the minute the finger underlined
[1:52:17] November 3 times instead of tapping it I
[1:52:20] saw a fist ball up and it hit the
[1:52:22] calendar and literally the calendar
[1:52:25] exploded into the wall the numbers
[1:52:27] seemed that there were 3d and they were
[1:52:28] falling they were just flying everywhere
[1:52:29] and there was a cloud of chaos that
[1:52:32] started and then the next thing that saw
[1:52:34] was I saw I saw armed protesters I saw
[1:52:39] fighting in the streets I saw people
[1:52:41] pummeling one another I saw businesses
[1:52:43] shuttered and shut up I saw I saw
[1:52:46] schools closed
[1:52:48] I saw school rooms with cobwebs hanging
[1:52:51] in them and like things like papers
[1:52:53] falling off the wall and posta felt like
[1:52:55] no one had been in them for months
[1:52:57] I saw banks Bank buildings with the
[1:53:01] roofs being taken off and looked almost
[1:53:03] like alien abduction because money was
[1:53:05] just flying through the roof into some
[1:53:08] type of like a vacuum cleaner that
[1:53:09] sounds kind of strange but I was
[1:53:11] watching wealth just being taken
[1:53:13] I saw politicians in back rooms making
[1:53:18] deals with people patting you patting
[1:53:20] people in the back and laughing and
[1:53:22] smiling and smirking and I saw monuments
[1:53:24] I saw I saw Washington DC burning I saw
[1:53:28] Washington DC blazing I saw fires
[1:53:32] everywhere I saw people being rounded up
[1:53:34] I saw Chinese and Russian soldiers on
[1:53:39] the grant and Russian soldiers were
[1:53:41] telling the Chinese soldiers to go and
[1:53:42] pick up these people round up these
[1:53:44] people secure this quadrant secure this
[1:53:46] area I saw blue helmets of the UN I saw
[1:53:49] military things taking place
[1:53:51] I also saw no sign of President Trump
[1:53:56] I saw no sign of leadership in
[1:53:58] Washington DC but the vultures that I
[1:54:01] had seen were now like gargoyles and
[1:54:02] there were 10 feet off the ground 10 to
[1:54:04] 15 feet off the ground and they were
[1:54:07] just attacking people mercilessly
[1:54:10] I saw people hiding in their homes and
[1:54:14] garages
[1:54:15] I saw churches being burned I saw homes
[1:54:18] being burned
[1:54:20] I saw absolute chaos and the fist punch
[1:54:23] on the November of 2020 is what got my
[1:54:27] attention and then I heard the words
[1:54:29] again brace herself brace yourself brace
[1:54:34] yourself that has been something that I
[1:54:37] have heard for almost almost seven well
[1:54:39] seven months now starting if once we get
[1:54:42] the July it's gonna be seven months and
[1:54:44] once again I'm not claiming to be a
[1:54:46] prophet I'm not claiming to proclaim you
[1:54:47] know just well see what happens in
[1:54:49] November through November and see if I'm
[1:54:51] right about this but I know when I hear
[1:54:53] God's voice I know what God's voice
[1:54:55] sounds like to me I know when he speaks
[1:54:57] and I know when I have a dream that I
[1:54:59] know is him and the things that I was
[1:55:02] saying I don't say this to scare people
[1:55:04] but I say this to warn people that there
[1:55:06] are some pretty sinister things coming
[1:55:09] down the pike and not just for the loss
[1:55:11] but for God's people as well the second
[1:55:14] dream I had last night and it woke me up
[1:55:17] in this dream we just had a yard sale to
[1:55:20] help fund a and a team going to Ecuador
[1:55:23] this next year and we had a yard sale
[1:55:26] and I had asked our secretary to get us
[1:55:28] some change for that secretary that for
[1:55:30] that yard sale so in the dream that I'm
[1:55:34] having I walked to the bank I walk into
[1:55:37] the bank to get some change and on the
[1:55:39] door it says there's no change available
[1:55:41] I saw the sign at registered in my mom
[1:55:44] and I walked on in and the president of
[1:55:46] the local bank was at the teller station
[1:55:48] and she had she was gonna be taking care
[1:55:52] of business and I said I need to get $10
[1:55:56] in quarters for yard sale and she said
[1:55:58] I'm sorry
[1:55:59] but the US Mint is no longer making
[1:56:02] currency or making change like pennies
[1:56:06] nickels dimes quarters half
[1:56:07] we're not doing that anymore I said well
[1:56:09] what do you mean she said they've
[1:56:10] stopped doing it and I said well how are
[1:56:11] we gonna be able to charge a dollar 50
[1:56:13] for anything and she said prepare for
[1:56:15] hyperinflation and just charge $2 and
[1:56:19] then she said to me in the dream oh and
[1:56:21] by the way $1 and $5 bills will follow
[1:56:24] soon after that and then I heard those
[1:56:28] words brace herself brace yourself brace
[1:56:33] yourself and I woke up I wrote these
[1:56:36] things down I've never gone on video and
[1:56:40] a record of the dreams that I've had and
[1:56:42] I hesitated to not do the one I had back
[1:56:45] in December but everything I saw and
[1:56:48] that dream in December came true between
[1:56:50] March and June when in the dream I was
[1:56:53] showed March through June and so I don't
[1:56:56] think I would be doing anyone a service
[1:57:00] if I don't share what I saw in these
[1:57:03] dreams and visions and I believe that
[1:57:04] we're gonna see not just a second huge
[1:57:06] wave of cobia between September October
[1:57:08] November but we're gonna see major
[1:57:11] things with the elections we're gonna
[1:57:12] see major chaos in our country we're
[1:57:14] gonna see troops in our cities we're
[1:57:17] gonna see the protests get even worse
[1:57:20] we're gonna see buildings burn we're
[1:57:21] gonna see what could only lead to civil
[1:57:25] war in this country and so for my
[1:57:28] friends that are believers I'm here I'm
[1:57:30] just gonna show you what I what I think
[1:57:32] you need to hear first of all you need
[1:57:34] to be preparing food you make sure
[1:57:37] you've got alternative forms of currency
[1:57:39] like silver or gold or whatever I
[1:57:41] believe you need to have an ample supply
[1:57:43] of both guns and ammunition and that's
[1:57:46] not just the second amendment fan of me
[1:57:48] coming out that is the things that we're
[1:57:49] seeing there talk about defunding the
[1:57:52] police that means one thing you're on
[1:57:54] your own a lot of areas I also believe
[1:57:57] you need to be praying like you've never
[1:57:58] prayed before make sure your family
[1:58:00] knows what's going on where you are have
[1:58:02] some some communication between your
[1:58:04] family about if certain things happen if
[1:58:07] certain things go down I'm not saying
[1:58:10] get off the grid and I've never ever
[1:58:12] said anything like this in my church I
[1:58:15] have said I believe things that this
[1:58:17] could happen but I've never done what
[1:58:19] I'm doing
[1:58:19] now I'm telling you that between
[1:58:22] September and November of this coming
[1:58:24] year and you'll be able to check me know
[1:58:25] if if bout time these November nothing's
[1:58:27] happened or simmer first man you called
[1:58:30] you call me on this si Dana cover stone
[1:58:32] you were an absolute idiot and a fool
[1:58:34] for saying those things go right ahead
[1:58:36] but I realize I'm responsible for what
[1:58:39] I've spoken but I also know what I sense
[1:58:42] and I know the Holy Spirit's voice
[1:58:43] enough to know that what I've heard I
[1:58:45] believe is gonna happen and what I heard
[1:58:47] in December happened between March and
[1:58:49] June not because I'm a prophet because
[1:58:52] dreams have a prophetic edge to them
[1:58:54] sometimes I've been doing a whole series
[1:58:56] on dreams and visions I'm gonna finish
[1:58:58] that series up tonight on my our church
[1:59:01] and gonna talk about why dreams and
[1:59:03] visions are literally an extension of
[1:59:05] the spiritual gifts at first Corinthians
[1:59:07] chapter 12 because we're a wisdom or a
[1:59:08] knowledge the servant all those things
[1:59:09] are required for dreams and I pray Lord
[1:59:13] show me what these things mean that I
[1:59:15] have seen show me how to interpret them
[1:59:17] and what they are and right now as I
[1:59:21] speak this it is it was June 24th
[1:59:23] Wednesday night at 5:30 p.m. in
[1:59:27] Burkesville Kentucky I'm in my office at
[1:59:30] the church Limor ministries in Birch
[1:59:32] Hill Kentucky sharing this not to scare
[1:59:35] you because I believe you know look God
[1:59:37] gave the prophets of the Old Testament a
[1:59:39] lot of warnings not to scare people but
[1:59:41] to prepare them for what was coming and
[1:59:43] sometimes challenging you don't just
[1:59:46] throw my word away don't just think I'm
[1:59:48] some some preacher trying to get people
[1:59:50] to come that's not it either
[1:59:52] because look the Bible says last day is
[1:59:54] a bit great falling away Jesus tells
[1:59:56] people to endure to the end make sure
[1:59:58] you endure to the end why because people
[2:00:00] won't endure sound doctrine they're
[2:00:02] gonna they're gonna hear something you
[2:00:03] know some of you hear me and go oh man
[2:00:04] he is on drugs or something I'm just
[2:00:08] telling you the dreams I've had you can
[2:00:10] do with them you can interpret them the
[2:00:12] way that you want to but I'm going to
[2:00:14] declare that I believe we're gonna see
[2:00:16] between September and November
[2:00:17] incredible terrible awful nasty bad
[2:00:19] things happen this nation and for the
[2:00:22] people who are not prepared for it it's
[2:00:23] not just going to catch them catch them
[2:00:25] in a bad place it's gonna destroy a lot
[2:00:28] of faith a lot of harlot relationships a
[2:00:31] lot of people it's gonna the
[2:00:33] aim is to kill this nation because right
[2:00:35] now we are a nation that stands in the
[2:00:37] way of a lot of the Antichrist
[2:00:38] principles like freedom liberty justice
[2:00:41] First Amendment Second Amendment thus
[2:00:43] Antichrist doesn't want those things and
[2:00:45] yes I do believe the under Christ is
[2:00:46] alive and well on planet Earth and I
[2:00:49] don't like I don't I don't really care
[2:00:52] what people think about this video you
[2:00:54] can call me whatever you want you can
[2:00:56] say whatever you want about me but wait
[2:00:58] till December first to say it and if I'm
[2:01:01] wrong I'll be the first one to come out
[2:01:03] and say folks I don't know what I was
[2:01:04] thinking I don't want to hate that night
[2:01:07] I've never had two dreams like this I've
[2:01:10] never had a part 1 part 2 part 1 came
[2:01:12] fully true and part 2 I believe will as
[2:01:16] well so heed my words folks believers
[2:01:20] stop messing around if you're not living
[2:01:23] for the Lord like you need to because
[2:01:25] the press there's an Olive Press moment
[2:01:29] coming for the church in this country an
[2:01:31] Olive Press moment and we're gonna get
[2:01:35] crushed and squeeze and push down that's
[2:01:38] why I believe God keeps saying brace
[2:01:40] yourself he's saying this to me so I can
[2:01:42] say to you brace yourself for the things
[2:01:44] that are coming endure to the end no
[2:01:47] matter how hard it gets I'm not giving
[2:01:49] up the faith that I have in Christ I've
[2:01:51] come too far on this walk and too far in
[2:01:53] my life to do that but I want to make
[2:01:56] sure that others don't make that mistake
[2:01:57] and don't just walk away from it take up
[2:02:02] the cross deny yourself and follow him
[2:02:05] thanks for listening I could say a lot
[2:02:10] of things and I was affected by it
[2:02:16] watching it today I just thought it was
[2:02:18] astounding you said with a Matt well you
[2:02:20] know what if it doesn't come true well
[2:02:23] what if it doesn't and here's a man
[2:02:25] who's putting himself out there put it
[2:02:26] on his facebook his personal facebook
[2:02:29] first part says he's got a group of men
[2:02:32] he could name dreamed about everything
[2:02:36] we're seeing today protests Cove it the
[2:02:39] whole thing and it came to pass could it
[2:02:42] be could be you know God uses dreams
[2:02:46] we don't throw the entire Bible God use
[2:02:48] rooms think of us think of the dreams
[2:02:49] that brother branham tells attributes to
[2:02:51] his ministry that were given by other
[2:02:53] men junior Jackson and you know
[2:02:55] different ones brother brother
[2:02:57] he's but I'm trying to think of the
[2:02:59] other one who I was just reading about
[2:03:01] today and standing in the gap he heard
[2:03:04] that brother Branham tell us about the
[2:03:06] man who has that has the dream there
[2:03:08] where he goes with and they took off but
[2:03:10] you know God used dreams throughout the
[2:03:13] whole Bible think of Abimelech middle
[2:03:16] like with Sarah Abraham has a dream
[2:03:19] pilot's wife you know has a dream in the
[2:03:21] middle of the night says leave this man
[2:03:23] alone has troubled me in a dream all
[2:03:24] night God can use dreams God could speak
[2:03:27] to anybody and a lot of people say oh
[2:03:29] well you know who's this guy what I'm
[2:03:31] not espousing
[2:03:32] this this gentleman or that his dream is
[2:03:34] vindicated and it's gonna gonna come to
[2:03:36] pass I don't know all I know friends is
[2:03:38] the world is shaking and where is your
[2:03:41] refuge what is your hope where's your
[2:03:43] hope at what is what is your refuge
[2:03:46] where's your stability in times like
[2:03:48] this I think sometimes we it's good for
[2:03:51] moments like these to happen so that we
[2:03:55] even as the elected of God can check
[2:03:56] ourself and say Lord what beat am i
[2:03:59] marching to I I don't know when the
[2:04:03] coming to laura's no man knows the day

[2:04:07] happen tomorrow will happen in November
[2:04:08] September the rest of the year all I
[2:04:11] know is I want my hope to be in Jesus I
[2:04:13] want him to be that and nothing else cuz
