[0:00] quote but there was a part of it that
[0:02] had struck my heart that maybe he and i
[0:04] had mentioned it to him after the fact
[0:06] there's a particular aspect of it that
[0:08] he never covered and then he asked me to
[0:09] do a sunday school about it so when i
[0:11] told him kind of what i uh had saw there
[0:13] so i want to read the quote again and um
[0:16] uh says now why does god call these
[0:19] churches his churches even though they
[0:21] are the false vine
[0:23] the truth of the matter is that they are
[0:25] christians but they are not christians
[0:27] of the spirit they are christians of the
[0:28] flesh they are bearing the name in vain
[0:32] mark 7 7
[0:34] how be it in vain do they worship me
[0:37] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[0:39] of men
[0:41] but indeed they are christians for what
[0:43] else could they be
[0:44] and is muhammadan
[0:46] that is his religion no matter how he
[0:48] lives
[0:48] lives it because he subscribes in theory
[0:50] to what the qur'an teaches
[0:52] in the same way a christian is a
[0:54] christian as long as he subscribes to
[0:56] the fact that jesus is the son of god
[0:58] born of a virgin was crucified
[1:01] and died and rose again that he is the
[1:03] savior of mankind etc
[1:06] in fact in the late ocean age
[1:09] there will be those who call themselves
[1:10] christians because they subscribe to the
[1:13] fine qualities of jesus
[1:15] while reserving to themselves the right
[1:17] to deny his deity
[1:19] christian scientists have done
[1:21] that already as well as multitudes who
[1:24] preach a social gospel
[1:27] now
[1:28] brother branham uses the phrase social
[1:30] gospel regularly throughout the message
[1:32] uses it a lot
[1:34] and i
[1:35] growing up in the message i heard it a
[1:36] lot and i never
[1:38] had a um
[1:40] i didn't realize that there was a little
[1:41] bit more i always took it as a
[1:43] him just sort of saying that it's a
[1:45] socially acceptable gospel that we're
[1:46] gonna we're gonna modify the gospel
[1:50] um to sort of fit contemporary times and
[1:53] you all pray for me when i have to talk
[1:54] fast i got not a lot of time to get
[1:56] through a lot so um
[1:58] he i always kind of took it like and we
[2:00] kind of see this in modern times um
[2:03] if any of you have heard of a guy by the
[2:05] name of michael o'fallon he's a elder in
[2:08] the southern baptist convention i say
[2:09] elder i know he's an influential figure
[2:12] and he's been involved in a lot of the
[2:13] recent church dealings
[2:16] and he started pushing back really hard
[2:19] because of the
[2:21] major movement to
[2:23] have what you might call a socially
[2:26] progressive
[2:27] evangelical church um uh more
[2:30] colloquially we would say um
[2:32] uh like woke to the the church would be
[2:35] woke um and you're starting to see a lot
[2:37] of this um and i'm gonna just go through
[2:39] some of the different things
[2:40] um that the things that i've seen and
[2:42] stuff that um mr o'fallon kind of
[2:45] detailed and some of the stuff that he
[2:46] was doing really kind of helps
[2:47] documenting that kind of stuff but um
[2:51] just different things like
[2:53] i've seen stuff just on various social
[2:55] media platforms um one thing that
[2:57] absolutely horrified me was this kind of
[3:00] i used the largest air quotes possible
[3:02] but pastor who was telling people i mean
[3:05] just absolutely blasphemous doctrine
[3:07] about um i mean he outright said that
[3:10] there's you know multiple ways to to cr
[3:12] to to god ex outside of christ
[3:15] talking about
[3:17] let me just
[3:18] total acceptance of of sort of the trans
[3:21] agenda the gay rights agenda the whole
[3:24] the whole thing right
[3:25] um there's just a couple other things
[3:27] that um mr o'fallon was talking about
[3:30] that i had seen um
[3:34] some of you might have heard of
[3:34] something called resolution nine
[3:36] this was um
[3:38] put through the southern baptist
[3:40] convention
[3:41] um
[3:42] and
[3:43] um
[3:46] the
[3:47] in essence it's a little bit longer than
[3:49] what i can actually read but the long
[3:51] and short of it was that the southern
[3:53] baptist convention which is the largest
[3:55] protestant denomination in the world
[3:57] um
[3:59] has now officially accepted critical
[4:02] race theory as a an official lens
[4:05] through which to view the scripture
[4:07] now
[4:08] i don't know how educated everyone is on
[4:10] a critical race theory
[4:12] but
[4:13] put simply
[4:15] it's about as anti-new testament
[4:17] doctrine as you're gonna get
[4:19] um
[4:20] for the southern baptist convention to
[4:21] make that an official stance is i mean
[4:24] they they might as well declare
[4:26] themselves antichrist
[4:28] which a prophet already did but we won't
[4:30] go there um
[4:32] so
[4:33] you also have um so you had that
[4:36] also within um
[4:40] oh yeah you also had uh the gospel
[4:42] coalition um it's a large
[4:44] interdenominational organization uh put
[4:47] out an eight-part series on how the
[4:48] gospel uh how to view the gospel through
[4:51] the lens of um
[4:53] uh
[4:54] daredevil and foucault these are
[4:55] post-modernist philosophers anyone who's
[4:57] ever heard a single jordan peterson
[4:59] lecture is going to know what that is
[5:01] about um let's just say it's not good um
[5:04] it basically you're you strip any
[5:06] authority out of the scripture if you're
[5:07] viewing the scripture through that lens
[5:10] um
[5:11] you also have the uh
[5:13] presbyterian church um is dealing with
[5:16] critical gender theory um
[5:19] and you're just seeing this massive
[5:20] explosion of
[5:22] like i said what we would call sort of
[5:23] woke ideology within the church being
[5:25] accepted as doctrine um
[5:28] exactly what uh brother branham said
[5:30] here
[5:31] um
[5:32] in the italian church age in fact in the
[5:34] laodicean age there will be those who
[5:36] call themselves christians
[5:38] because they subscribe to the fine
[5:40] qualities of jesus while reserving to
[5:42] themselves the right to deny his deity
[5:44] christian scientists have done this
[5:46] already as well multitude through social
[5:48] gospel
[5:50] and also in mark 7 where it says how be
[5:51] it in vain do they worship me teaching
[5:53] the doctrines and commandments of men
[5:55] they're worshiping god
[5:57] claiming to while teaching
[6:00] foucault and dereda i mean it's it's
[6:02] complete
[6:03] it's a complete abomination
[6:08] and now you you've got to ask the
[6:09] question why are these churches that
[6:12] have been around for in some cases
[6:13] hundreds of years or well over 100 years
[6:15] anyways
[6:16] why are they suddenly shifting to this
[6:19] and it's because
[6:21] as the elder generation dies off
[6:23] um you're getting newer generations of
[6:26] church leadership
[6:27] who have all been educated in this stuff
[6:29] they've all went to college they've all
[6:30] been educated in this um you had um
[6:35] uh the f uh is the 45th moderator of the
[6:37] general assembly of the presbyterian
[6:39] church effectively he's the president of
[6:41] the presbyterian church openly say i am
[6:43] a critical race this is one of the big
[6:45] addresses to the whole sort of church
[6:47] leadership said i'm a critical race
[6:48] theorist
[6:49] and i believe that you can be a
[6:51] christian and a critical race theorist
[6:53] at the same time i personally disagree
[6:55] and i think paul would as well but
[6:57] i mean i mean a huge part of paul's
[6:59] ministry was
[7:00] um was
[7:03] smashing the divisions between
[7:05] jew and gentile and that there would be
[7:08] a roman church and a hebrew church and a
[7:10] greek church and that these would all be
[7:11] sort of racially segregated and sort of
[7:13] and and and not have some sort of um
[7:17] uh that they they wouldn't
[7:19] come together as a as a unified church
[7:20] under christ
[7:21] um and this is this is exactly what
[7:24] you'll get if you try to merge critical
[7:26] race theory and
[7:27] and scripture
[7:29] um
[7:30] uh
[7:31] anyways um i'm gonna skip over some of
[7:34] this
[7:35] um anyway so they're losing membership
[7:37] because what you're having is you're
[7:38] having the older generations
[7:40] die off they were
[7:41] you know regular members of all these
[7:43] churches and then they die and their
[7:45] kids
[7:46] went to college and became social
[7:48] activists and didn't come back
[7:50] and so you're getting church leadership
[7:53] going well
[7:54] we can't
[7:56] we can't properly
[7:59] you know spread the gospel to all these
[8:00] various communities
[8:02] because we're not packaging
[8:04] the gospel in
[8:06] social activism
[8:08] we can't
[8:09] we can't reach out to the younger
[8:10] generations because all they want to do
[8:12] they want to do their social activism
[8:14] work right they're they're more
[8:16] interested in in
[8:17] say gender theory or you know you know
[8:20] transgender rights than they are in
[8:22] anything that we have to offer so we
[8:23] have to repackage the gospel into that
[8:25] to get them to come to church
[8:28] um
[8:35] and one of the so i i saw an interview
[8:38] with a
[8:39] he's actually an atheist but he was
[8:41] talking with like i said uh mr o'fallon
[8:44] who's a member of the church and he's
[8:46] talking to this atheist because this
[8:47] atheist had already seen
[8:49] this
[8:50] exact same movement through the
[8:51] universities and how it just degenerated
[8:53] completely
[8:54] cored him out
[8:55] and he asked him well what do you think
[8:58] about this and he says well i think
[9:00] if i was back in the day when i was a
[9:02] really militant atheist i would be
[9:05] jumping for joy he said because i
[9:06] believed then that if you wanted to
[9:09] destroy the church you would start
[9:11] making
[9:12] woke preachers and sending them into the
[9:13] church because it will just eat itself
[9:15] from the inside
[9:17] and
[9:19] um
[9:20] so he's like you have a you have a big
[9:22] pretty wooden horse outside your gates
[9:23] is what you have and if you let it in
[9:25] it's going to kill you from the inside
[9:27] um now
[9:29] we're all pretty aware of this we all
[9:30] are aware of
[9:32] uh anyone who's been following culture
[9:34] the news or anything pretty aware of how
[9:36] this stuff works
[9:37] um or if not uh really in depth at least
[9:41] on the surface level
[9:42] but i want to go back to that quote
[9:45] where brother branham
[9:46] said
[9:49] in fact in the laodicean age
[9:51] there will be those who call themselves
[9:53] christians
[9:54] because they subscribe to the fine
[9:56] qualities of jesus
[9:57] while reserving to themselves the right
[9:59] to deny his deity
[10:01] christian scientists have done that
[10:03] already as well as multitudes who preach
[10:06] a social gospel now
[10:11] i was unaware until a couple months ago
[10:15] and i kind of forgot the brother brandon
[10:17] uses terminology
[10:18] and then i heard something else from a
[10:20] political commentator
[10:21] and then brother jason preaches the
[10:22] sermon where he reads that quote and
[10:24] it's like this light bulb goes off
[10:26] every we kind of sort of take this
[10:29] phrase the social gospel as just sort of
[10:30] like i said sort of like a socially
[10:32] acceptable new gospel but that actually
[10:34] referred to something specific there was
[10:36] actually a movement that started in the
[10:38] late 1800s i want to say about 1870 and
[10:41] ran up until the 1930s 1940s called the
[10:44] social gospel movement
[10:46] and
[10:48] um
[10:49] i just so
[10:51] one of the main
[10:53] thinkers in it was walter rosenbosch
[10:56] who in 1917 wrote what
[10:58] is considered
[11:00] the bible of the social gospels a book
[11:02] called um a theology for the social
[11:05] gospel
[11:07] and it the social gospel movement had
[11:09] such a massive widespread impact on
[11:12] american culture and politics that um it
[11:16] actually got a president elected uh
[11:17] woodrow wilson was a adherent to the
[11:20] social gospel
[11:22] and actually they were able to pass the
[11:24] 18th amendment that the 18th amendment
[11:26] which we would more refer to as the
[11:28] prohibition amendment amendment was the
[11:30] work of social gospel politicians
[11:33] um
[11:34] and so i want to read you some some
[11:36] excerpts from the theology of the social
[11:38] gospel
[11:39] because when you read this you suddenly
[11:42] realize that this whole woke thing ain't
[11:45] new
[11:46] it's old
[11:47] it's the same spirit
[11:50] repackaged on a different coat of paint
[11:53] the
[11:54] brother random say that uh god takes his
[11:56] man but leaves the spirit and the devil
[11:57] takes his man and leaves the spirit same
[12:00] thing
[12:01] um
[12:03] so this is this is just a couple
[12:04] excerpts from right beginning the book
[12:07] um and like i said this is uh rosenbosch
[12:10] in the theology of the social gospel
[12:13] if theology stops growing or is unable
[12:15] to adjust itself to its modern
[12:16] environment and meet its present tasks
[12:19] it will die
[12:20] many now regarded as dead the social
[12:23] gospel needs a theology to make it
[12:25] effective but theology
[12:28] needs the social gospel to vitalize it
[12:32] so this is a man who's claiming to be a
[12:33] christian
[12:34] who
[12:36] ostensibly believes in the eternal word
[12:38] of god but need thinks that the word of
[12:40] god needs a social movement to vitalize
[12:42] it
[12:42] that's interesting
[12:45] the argument of this book is built on
[12:47] the conviction that the social gospel is
[12:49] a permanent addition to our spiritual
[12:51] outlook
[12:52] and that its
[12:54] arrival constitutes a stage in the
[12:56] development of the christian religion
[12:58] we need not waste words to prove that
[13:00] the social gospel is being preached it
[13:04] is no longer a prophetic and occasional
[13:05] note
[13:06] it is a novelty only in backwards social
[13:09] or religious communities right only only
[13:12] those holy rollers believe in anything
[13:13] other than this um
[13:16] right you know only those those weirdo
[13:18] cultists believe in anything other than
[13:21] this new socially progressive gospel is
[13:24] that clock broken
[13:25] it hasn't moved in a while
[13:29] it's cortisol okay
[13:34] um the social gospel has become orthodox
[13:38] it is not only preached it has set new
[13:41] problems for local church work and has
[13:42] turned the pastoral organizing work of
[13:44] the ministry into new and constructive
[13:46] directions really
[13:49] well i thought the pastoral work and the
[13:51] church organization should be saving
[13:52] centers
[13:54] why is it in new directions now
[13:56] why what what new directions are we
[13:58] going in that
[13:59] that is you know you see you see what
[14:01] i'm saying um
[14:03] the church has always had or at least
[14:06] ostensibly has always had a focus on
[14:09] saving sinners and and promoting the the
[14:12] work of christ why are we changing it
[14:13] into new directions this is clearly
[14:16] not a christian movement
[14:18] this is something other than that it's
[14:20] paint got a coat of paint as a christian
[14:21] movement but it is not christian
[14:25] huh it has imparted a wider vision and a
[14:28] more statesmanlike grasp to the foreign
[14:30] mission enterprise
[14:33] the religious literature uttering the
[14:35] social gospel is notable both for its
[14:37] volume and its vitality and conviction
[14:40] the emotional fervor of the new
[14:41] convictions has created prayers and
[14:44] hymns of social aspiration
[14:46] prayers and hymns of social aspiration
[14:49] prayers
[14:50] not of worship
[14:52] not of praising god
[14:53] not of communing with the lord your
[14:55] savior but social aspiration
[14:58] and hymns were singing the praises of
[15:00] what exactly
[15:06] uh let's see
[15:08] um
[15:10] lost my place um
[15:16] so okay
[15:17] um uh for which newer handbooks are
[15:19] making room conservative denominations
[15:21] have formally committed themselves to
[15:23] the fundamental ideas of the social
[15:24] gospel and their practical application
[15:27] the plans of great interdenominational
[15:29] organizations are inspired by it it has
[15:32] become a constructive force in american
[15:35] politics
[15:36] not american religion
[15:38] or society or culture but politics
[15:42] this new orientation which is observable
[15:44] in all parts of our religious life is
[15:46] not simply a prudent adjustment of
[15:48] church methods to change conditions
[15:51] there is religious compulsion behind it
[15:53] those who are in touch with a student
[15:55] population know that the impulse to
[15:57] social service means to college men and
[15:59] women it is the most religious element
[16:02] in the life of many of them
[16:06] man
[16:07] you thought that was wrote in 2020 not
[16:08] 1920
[16:11] among ministerial students there is an
[16:13] almost impatient demand for a proper
[16:15] social outlet
[16:17] some hesitate to enter the regular
[16:19] ministry at all because they doubt
[16:20] whether it will offer them sufficient
[16:22] opportunity and freedom to utter and
[16:24] apply their social convictions
[16:27] for many ministers who have come under
[16:29] the influence of the social gospel in
[16:30] mature years it has signified a
[16:32] religious crisis and where it has been
[16:34] met successfully it has brought fresh
[16:36] joy and power and a distinct enlargement
[16:38] of the mind
[16:42] it has taken the place of conventional
[16:45] religion and the lives of many outside
[16:48] the church
[16:50] we i mean this is this is obvious
[16:52] anybody who's seen some of the stuff
[16:53] that's happened knows that the people
[16:55] who are
[16:56] acting the way that they are they see
[16:58] this is they don't have god in their
[17:00] lives but they have to worship something
[17:01] so they're worshiping their social
[17:03] activism and this is the reason they act
[17:05] like
[17:06] like zealots effect essentially i mean
[17:08] they they they will happily kill people
[17:11] in the name of their social activism so
[17:14] um yeah it's the most religious thing
[17:16] that a lot of people have right now and
[17:18] this is the core of the whole thing in
[17:19] case any of you had not quite figured it
[17:21] out yet
[17:22] as to what is the motivating force
[17:24] behind the social gospel
[17:26] he says it right here
[17:27] it constitutes the moral power and the
[17:30] propaganda of socialism
[17:34] this is explicitly a marxist
[17:37] ideology where they tried to package
[17:39] marxism in a in a christian robe
[17:42] because and think about what he says
[17:44] it's the moral power and the propaganda
[17:46] of socialism socialism is a political
[17:48] move social gospel
[17:50] is a moral
[17:51] position the gospel is moral it's not
[17:53] political gospel has never been about
[17:55] politics right jesus said give unto
[17:56] caesar what is caesar god unto gods
[17:58] separate your politics and your religion
[18:00] they're not the same thing
[18:02] and
[18:04] we
[18:06] and but what they're trying to do is
[18:07] merge the two because it gives their
[18:09] their
[18:10] frankly evil
[18:12] uh political ideology
[18:14] a moral core that they can that they can
[18:16] use to to
[18:18] dupe people into
[18:20] buying in
[18:22] and he goes on i i don't was that the
[18:24] time
[18:27] okay all right
[18:28] um i'm going to uh skip over some of
[18:31] this um but in effect he goes on to just
[18:33] talk about how um
[18:37] well i'll just read one little excerpt
[18:38] whoever wants to hold audiences of
[18:40] working people must establish some
[18:41] connection between religion and their
[18:43] social feelings and experiences this
[18:45] they packaged it then as well the church
[18:47] is dying and we have to change the
[18:50] gospel to meet some new political agenda
[18:53] to entice people into our churches
[18:55] because the church membership is dying
[18:57] and we're not going to appeal to those
[18:58] younger generations it's the same thing
[18:59] that they're doing now
[19:01] it's
[19:02] it is a
[19:04] political move
[19:06] disguised as a religious one
[19:09] the fact of the matter is
[19:11] um
[19:14] and i just want to go back to
[19:16] that quote
[19:17] um
[19:20] how be it in vain do they worship me
[19:21] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[19:24] of men
[19:25] we now have the churches shifting from
[19:28] what we read in acts 2 to repent be
[19:30] baptized and be filled with the holy
[19:31] spirit to repent be baptized do your
[19:33] social activism work and then be filled
[19:35] with the baptizement of the holy spirit
[19:37] right
[19:38] there there i mean
[19:40] in the um southern baptist church they
[19:42] literally had
[19:44] a
[19:44] um
[19:47] it was a it was a talk where they were
[19:49] teaching the the leadership about how
[19:52] they need to start including
[19:54] um
[19:55] like uh critical race theory activism as
[19:59] a
[20:00] sort of inclusion within sort of like i
[20:02] said that that gospel
[20:04] teaching that it's not just sinner saved
[20:06] sinners saved by grace it's sinners
[20:08] saved by grace and
[20:10] woke ideology
[20:12] it's it's it's the gospel plus right
[20:15] like i think brother jason mentioned
[20:17] that one time when he was preaching and
[20:20] i think that
[20:21] and i think we could all agree that this
[20:23] is
[20:24] uh well because
[20:25] uh when he says um
[20:28] in the latest churches they'll call
[20:29] themselves christians because they
[20:30] subscribe to the fine qualities of jesus
[20:32] while reserving themselves the right to
[20:33] deny his deity
[20:35] they'd have to deny his deity because if
[20:36] they accepted his deity there would be
[20:38] they would they would be ashamed to try
[20:39] to do this to try to package politics
[20:42] into the gospel to use the gospel as a
[20:44] political tool the gospel's never been
[20:46] about politics it's about saving sinners
[20:48] because it's about people who need help
[20:50] and and uh i was actually thinking about
[20:52] this
[20:53] um
[20:54] before i came out and when i was getting
[20:56] ready for church
[20:58] how i thought it was very fitting that
[20:59] jesus would come
[21:01] to earth
[21:02] as the son of a carpenter and work in a
[21:03] carpenter shop because he would he's the
[21:06] god of creation so he would create as a
[21:08] carpenter he would build things from
[21:09] nothing but he would also spend his life
[21:11] fixing broken things
[21:13] and the world is a we have a world full
[21:15] of broken people that need christ and
[21:17] that's what the good news was for that
[21:19] you could repent be baptized and fill
[21:21] with the holy spirit and have a life
[21:22] that wasn't yours and
[21:25] to
[21:26] to the reason at the end of the day the
[21:28] reason why you do not package politics
[21:31] into your gospel is because you dilute
[21:34] the gospel
[21:36] you you dilute the gospel and you make
[21:38] you give your politics unearned morality
[21:41] that it doesn't have
[21:43] you you take something evil i mean i
[21:46] would just like to point out that this
[21:47] this in case anybody was unaware
[21:50] though i mean if we want to put put you
[21:52] know rank the
[21:53] ideologies of evil socialism killed far
[21:56] more people than nazism ever did
[21:58] right
[21:59] so why are we why what kind of demonic
[22:01] spirit would attach that to the gospel
[22:05] it's it it cores out anything rips the
[22:08] morality out of the gospel
[22:10] strips away any ability to help people
[22:13] and tells them that what they need is to
[22:14] vote
[22:16] you don't need to vote you need god
[22:18] right
[22:19] like god is the only planet and by the
[22:21] way i just want to
[22:23] make another comment about um one thing
[22:25] that i didn't get to
[22:26] with the social gospel they explicitly
[22:29] said that the aim of the social gospel
[22:31] was to
[22:33] bring the kingdom of god to earth
[22:35] through social activism
[22:37] that by changing the politics because
[22:38] they could legislate morality
[22:40] and make everyone on earth a christian
[22:41] through force of law
[22:43] that's why that's why they passed the
[22:45] prohibition movement by the way the
[22:46] prohibition amendment it was we would
[22:49] all agree we don't think you know
[22:50] drinking is is morally acceptable
[22:53] we don't believe in that
[22:54] but if you enact it by the force of of a
[22:56] gun
[22:57] that's not a christian act at all right
[23:00] that should be a voluntary act done
[23:02] between you and god not because the
[23:04] state told you to if that if the only
[23:06] reason why you're not drinking is the
[23:07] state told you to then
[23:09] sad to say but you haven't repented at
[23:11] all
[23:12] right
[23:13] and
[23:15] the end result of that like i said they
[23:18] removed the deity of god they removed
[23:21] they removed
[23:24] they removed
[23:26] behaving in a moral way
[23:28] from doing it because you you loved god
[23:31] and had a relationship with god and
[23:33] attached it to a political motive
[23:35] and
[23:36] the end result of that
[23:38] was so unpopular that a few years later
[23:41] they had to repeal the amendment
[23:43] it got literally millions of people
[23:45] killed because of the the cartels and
[23:47] the the mafia that popped up out of that
[23:49] amendment
[23:50] it it was a complete disaster it didn't
[23:53] work it didn't stop anyone from drinking
[23:56] it was a complete failure why because it
[23:58] was man trying to crowbar
[24:00] god's plan onto people whether they
[24:02] liked it or not
[24:03] and that's never going to work the only
[24:05] way to to a new life to to walk away
[24:09] from the things of the world is to have
[24:11] a personal relationship with god
[24:13] that is it you're not going to achieve
[24:16] utopia
[24:17] by by voting it's not going to work the
[24:20] political system is corrupt it's all
[24:22] going to break down
[24:26] and and
[24:27] it's it's pointless
[24:29] to try to do this anytime you try to
[24:31] push
[24:32] christian virtue
[24:34] through politics it won't work
[24:37] and
[24:39] um i think i'm out of time and i think
[24:41] that's a good place to stop
[24:43] so uh thank you all for listening and um
[24:46] uh i guess we'll stand and pray
[24:55] lord we thank you for this word you've
[24:56] given us this morning ask that you
[24:58] blessed and anoint the people that they
[24:59] would be able to get something out of it
[25:01] and i know that i might not be able to
[25:03] help anyone with
