[0:01] [Music]
[1:30] morning everyone
[1:31] Stan gracious Heavenly Father we come to
[1:39] you in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:40] we're so thankful for your grace and
[1:42] mercy to us in this hour Lord for having
[1:45] your hand upon our lives for t being the
[1:49] teacher being the guide being our
[1:53] absolute being our all in all we asked
[1:56] Father that you would help us this
[1:58] morning to get ourselves out of the way
[2:00] get the things that perhaps are weighing
[2:03] heavy on our mind put them aside and
[2:06] take the time just to focus on you Lord
[2:09] and turn our hearts towards you Lord
[2:12] forgive us for our sins and trespasses
[2:15] against you cleanse our hearts and minds
[2:17] that we might be a greater reflection of
[2:20] Jesus Christ in this hour we ask these
[2:23] things in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[2:25] and we're gonna turn in the scriptures
[2:28] right away 2nd Timothy chapter 3 just a
[2:33] short verse there verse 12 yay and all
[2:37] that live godly in Christ Jesus shall
[2:40] suffer persecution amen you can be
[2:43] seated I want to start a new series
[2:50] called Christian character so this will
[2:54] be part 1 and part 1 the focus is going
[2:57] to be the paradox of Christian suffering
[3:00] so we looked at there and it doesn't
[3:03] give any exceptions all that live godly
[3:06] in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution
[3:10] everyone all right so are we to expect
[3:14] an easy life as a Christian is that what
[3:18] God promises to us an easy life are we
[3:21] to anticipate that we're gonna float to
[3:23] heaven on a cloud with effortless
[3:26] simplicity if we do we need to rearrange
[3:30] our thinking as God is God's purpose to
[3:35] make our life easier
[3:38] are we promised our best life now are we
[3:45] promised to have ease and luxury are we
[3:48] promised to have no trials no suffering
[3:51] no we just read the scripture not at all
[3:56] so as a result of this this requires
[4:01] something of us
[4:03] this requires secondary character traits
[4:08] within us and we're going to talk about
[4:10] that but I want to I want to look at a
[4:13] few things brother Branham said greatest
[4:15] battle ever ever fought this is a this
[4:18] is a challenge to us when we look at
[4:21] Christian character we're not we're not
[4:23] here just to say hey everybody where we
[4:25] are I'm all right and you're all right
[4:27] and everything's fine I don't believe
[4:29] that's the role of preaching in the
[4:31] first place okay so we're gonna be
[4:34] hitting it hard let's just put it that
[4:36] way brother Branham says this listen you
[4:39] soldiers of the Cross when you
[4:41] disbelieve one word of God's written
[4:43] Bible you're disarmed you surrender you
[4:46] jellyfish put on the full armor of God
[4:49] amen were in a battle God's not calling
[4:54] us to be jellyfish God's not he's not
[4:57] calling us just to flow with the tides
[5:00] he's calling us to take a stand he's
[5:04] calling us to be strong and courageous
[5:07] brother Branham says in believe us now
[5:10] this in 1950 what's the matter with
[5:12] Christians wishy-washy half jellyfish
[5:15] get a backbone in you and stand up for
[5:18] God and what's right and today stand for
[5:20] what the Bible says and believe it with
[5:22] all your heart so this is the sub I
[5:27] believe this is a song of modern-day
[5:30] American Christianity and I'm gonna read
[5:33] this it's from the little booklet titled
[5:36] chocolate soldiers by missionary CT stud
[5:40] I may have read this before but it
[5:42] applies again here today it's based on
[5:46] that song and my a soldier of the Cross
[5:47] you may remember brother
[5:48] I'm referring to that song many times
[5:52] but he says he writes it this way about
[5:55] what the attitude of Christians in the
[5:57] 19th century and it's only worse today
[6:00] he says this I must be carried to the
[6:03] skies on a flowery bed of ease let
[6:06] others fight to win the prize or sail
[6:08] through bloody seas marked I'm Christian
[6:11] heroes never go to war stop in mind the
[6:14] babies playing on the floor wash and
[6:17] dress and feed them 40 times a week till
[6:19] the roly-poly pudding so to speak round
[6:22] and round the nursery let us ambulate
[6:24] sugar and spice and all this that's nice
[6:27] must be on our slate that's the spirit
[6:32] of Laodicea that's the spirit on
[6:35] American Christianity which that version
[6:37] of Christianity is being proclaimed on
[6:40] the airways and is infecting Christians
[6:43] around the world Joel Osteen and the
[6:46] prosperity preachers are teaching that
[6:48] we can have our best life now and that
[6:51] literally where this is a quote God
[6:53] wants to make your life easier this is
[6:58] the doctrine of the prosperity gospel
[7:00] and don't kid yourself
[7:02] this is affected do you think the
[7:05] mainstream thinking of American
[7:07] Christians and I'm sad to say I believe
[7:09] it's infected the thinking of message
[7:12] believers today God wants you to have an
[7:16] easier life a simpler life that's what
[7:20] we're seeking that's what we're looking
[7:22] after we're looking for for better
[7:24] things and better stuff and to improve
[7:26] our self in this world a sign of success
[7:33] is an easy and financially blessed life
[7:37] that's the viewpoint we have why because
[7:40] that's Laodicea that's what's all around
[7:42] us even our own minds we struggle in
[7:45] this life to see ourselves as a failure
[7:47] if we don't achieve a certain status of
[7:51] financial success I'm rich and increased
[7:57] with Goods and have need of nothing
[7:59] but they're spiritually destitute
[8:02] spiritually naked and spiritually dead
[8:05] and don't even know it
[8:07] brother Branham says in the church ages
[8:10] books communion church age the cloudy
[8:12] skies and storms of life are no signs of
[8:15] God's disapproval so we we need to
[8:18] change our thinking to God's thinking we
[8:21] look and say so and so they're a mess
[8:24] their life is this they have this
[8:26] problem this problem that problem and we
[8:28] see that as a sign of a failure as a
[8:31] Christian now that doesn't mean we go
[8:33] and do dumb stuff and put ourselves in
[8:35] bad situations it's not st. it's not
[8:37] saying that saying that sometimes when
[8:40] you look at a person you shouldn't say
[8:43] well they don't have the things of this
[8:45] life so they're not successful that's
[8:47] that's completely wrong thinking so I
[8:50] will continue on the cloudy skies and
[8:52] storms of life are no signs of God's
[8:53] disapproval neither are bright skies and
[8:57] Stillwater's signs of his love and
[9:00] approval his approval of any of us is
[9:04] only in the beloved in Christ that's
[9:09] that's how we're justified
[9:11] we have nothing to offer to God even our
[9:15] best that we offer to God God says I
[9:17] can't that's filthy rags I will not I
[9:20] cannot accept that in my presence the
[9:22] only thing he accepts is the
[9:24] righteousness perfect righteousness of
[9:27] Jesus Christ so don't think that your
[9:29] successful life somehow earns you the
[9:32] moral right to heaven because it doesn't
[9:35] it doesn't and there's people in this
[9:37] world okay we live in America we can't
[9:39] help that we can't change that we do our
[9:42] best with what we have we we seek to
[9:45] excel for the glory of God the results
[9:48] are up to him but there's people around
[9:50] the world that are suffering they have
[9:51] nothing
[9:52] does that make you better than
[9:55] absolutely not it's not a sign of his
[9:58] approval or disapproval whether you have
[10:00] a little or whether you have a lot but
[10:03] that's the American spirit and in it
[10:07] unfortunately infects all of us
[10:11] and if we don't fight against it will
[10:13] immediately look down on someone that
[10:15] doesn't have much of this world's goods
[10:18] it's a shame
[10:20] so I want to look at the paradox of the
[10:24] Christians joy in suffering it's a it's
[10:29] a tremendous paradox when you look at
[10:30] these things I'm just gonna read some
[10:32] not gonna give you the references we'll
[10:34] do that later I'm just gonna read some
[10:36] phrases from Scripture and every 10
[10:38] phrases from scripture and I hope that
[10:41] it sinks in listen listen please closely
[10:44] we rejoice in our sufferings blessed or
[10:50] happy are you when you're persecuted
[10:54] blessed or happy are you and men revile
[10:57] you and say all manner of evil against
[11:00] you don't tune out it's heavy woe unto
[11:06] you when all men speak well of you count
[11:12] it all joy when you meet trials I am
[11:16] content with weaknesses and insults and
[11:20] hardships I will boast all the more
[11:25] gladly of my achievements no I will
[11:29] boast all the more gladly of my
[11:31] weaknesses I rejoice in my sufferings if
[11:37] you are insulted for the name of Christ
[11:39] you are blessed as sorrowful yet always
[11:45] rejoicing it's a paradox isn't it God
[11:52] has a purpose in our suffering God has a
[11:57] plan for us within our suffering it's
[12:02] it's not by mistake it's not an accident
[12:07] God is designing every circumstance in
[12:11] our life for a purpose Romans 5 3
[12:16] through 5 you can pull that up but I'm
[12:18] gonna read it from the ESV so I don't
[12:20] know if you can pull it up in the ESV
[12:23] not only that but we rejoice in our
[12:26] sufferings so we can rejoice in our
[12:29] stuff in it from sufferings Paul says
[12:31] why knowing that suffering produces
[12:35] endurance I don't want to have endurance
[12:40] I just want it easy that's not what the
[12:44] how this life works and it's not not
[12:46] what the life of a Christian is
[12:48] suffering produces endurance and you're
[12:51] gonna need endurance jesus said he that
[12:54] endures to the end the same shall be
[12:57] saved and endurance produces character
[13:02] we want we want to have Christian
[13:05] character how you gonna get it
[13:07] suffering which produces endurance
[13:10] endurance produces character and
[13:13] character produces hope a person without
[13:19] hope really is someone who is extremely
[13:23] miserable because in this life everyone
[13:27] has troubles everyone has trials any
[13:30] even the people who have I don't want to
[13:33] get off my topic but people who have
[13:35] achieved the heights of success without
[13:38] Christ in their life what happens
[13:40] they are so miserable and so depressed
[13:43] why because all that they dreamed of is
[13:46] right before them and what is the result
[13:50] misery why because they have no meaning
[13:55] in their life
[13:56] the first their meaning was to achieve
[13:59] success they achieve it the meaning is
[14:01] now God what is beyond what is beyond
[14:05] this for a Christian we have so much
[14:07] beyond that there's so much beyond that
[14:10] and we haven't we so we have a hope we
[14:14] have something that we don't have yet
[14:16] that we're waiting for that we're
[14:17] anticipating will come to us and hope
[14:20] does not put us to shame why because
[14:22] we're hoping in the promises of God and
[14:24] God is faithful he never he never walks
[14:27] back on any of his promises ever under
[14:29] any circumstances hope does not put us
[14:32] to shame because God's love has been
[14:34] poured into our hearts through the Holy
[14:35] Spirit
[14:36] who has been given to us now this might
[14:41] help a little bit to think of this there
[14:42] are three different kinds as I see it
[14:44] three different kinds of suffering
[14:47] suffering that is common to all of
[14:49] mankind we live in a fallen world so
[14:52] everybody experience some pain heartache
[14:56] frustration of some kind you're not
[14:58] gonna get around that not until Christ
[15:01] returns it sets up the Millennial
[15:03] Kingdom second there's suffering because
[15:06] of our sinful choices we make a sinful
[15:09] choice and as a result there is a
[15:11] consequence both natural consequences
[15:15] and supernatural consequences ones that
[15:18] naturally follow sin and ones that God
[15:22] supernaturally allows in our life in
[15:25] order to correct us three there is
[15:29] suffering because our walk with Christ
[15:31] is contrary to this world order and
[15:35] that's what Scripture is primarily
[15:37] looking at when it's talking about being
[15:40] persecuted and suffering for the sake of
[15:43] the gospel you know we're not supposed
[15:45] to be loved and applauded by the world
[15:49] that's not supposed to be our aim it's
[15:52] not supposed to be our goal it's not our
[15:54] purpose in life we're we're looking to
[15:58] please an audience of one we're looking
[16:01] to get ourselves out of the way
[16:02] surrender ourselves to him so that he
[16:05] can do what he pleases within us and
[16:07] with whatever circumstance we find
[16:10] ourselves in we can be content and we
[16:12] can walk in him and be a living
[16:15] sacrifice so we shouldn't suppose that
[16:19] the Lord will will not allow demonic
[16:23] forces to lay traps for us we shouldn't
[16:27] suppose that he won't allow pain in our
[16:30] lives or that when you choose to do the
[16:33] will of God that suffering will come
[16:35] well we shouldn't suppose that it won't
[16:37] come because he promises that it will
[16:44] you're gonna be made fun of you're gonna
[16:46] be laughed at
[16:47] you're gonna be questioned why are you
[16:49] doing this are you crazy you're going to
[16:52] be told that you're a fanatic you're
[16:55] gonna be told that what you're doing and
[16:57] saying is hateful
[17:00] that's this world's viewpoint
[17:02] why wouldn't they say that Jesus said My
[17:06] Kingdom is not of this cosmos out of
[17:09] this world order so why in the world are
[17:12] we expecting an easy life and simplicity
[17:15] and people to agree with us we just want
[17:18] people to agree with us then you're
[17:20] following the wrong religion because
[17:24] it's not from this world order not only
[17:28] that but when you choose to follow
[17:30] Christ it means you stop following
[17:33] another thing and you're leaving
[17:36] something behind to follow something
[17:39] else and that immediately brings
[17:41] friction it Britt and it brings can
[17:46] bring suffering it can bring pain Jesus
[17:48] said I didn't bring come to bring peace
[17:50] on the earth but a sword dividing
[17:53] families and so on and so forth oh it
[17:55] doesn't have to be that way we can we
[17:57] can go with wisdom but the fact is when
[17:59] you say I choose Jesus Christ it flies
[18:02] in the face of what this world does and
[18:05] wants to do Matthew 10 25 it is enough
[18:11] for the disciple that he be as his
[18:13] master and the servant as his Lord if
[18:16] they have called the master of the house
[18:18] Beelzebub how much more shall they call
[18:21] them of his household so Jesus was
[18:26] called the look you know what this word
[18:31] Beelzebub means it's the lord of the
[18:34] dunghill
[18:36] it's the flood it's it's it's fly it's
[18:39] speaking of flies so there I mean that
[18:41] is an unbelievable insult so if they
[18:43] call him that what are they gonna call
[18:45] you we should expect that
[18:51] you know it's one thing to talk about it
[18:54] and you say that's a good doctrine
[18:55] brother
[18:56] it is good doctrine but what about in
[19:00] your life on a daily basis what do you
[19:02] anticipate what do you expect what are
[19:05] you looking for Luke 6:26 woe unto you
[19:10] when all men shall speak well of you for
[19:12] so did their fathers to the false
[19:16] prophets ouch we want people to speak
[19:21] well of us and we're shocked and
[19:23] dismayed when they don't why are you
[19:27] shocked and dismayed when people don't
[19:29] speak well of you you're to express your
[19:34] you should anticipate that that's the
[19:36] case you should understand that that's
[19:39] going to happen no you're not looking
[19:40] for it your heart is a heart of love
[19:43] your heart is a heart of forgiveness
[19:46] your heart is a heart of joy but people
[19:50] are gonna speak against you what's the
[19:52] problem so what they killed your master
[19:56] for what he spoke what do you expect
[19:58] that be patted on the back that gee
[20:02] thanks for telling us the truth well you
[20:06] might get that in church and we
[20:07] appreciate that when we do but you also
[20:09] might get in church where people are mad
[20:11] at you when you preach the truth so what
[20:14] should you do preach the truth again and
[20:18] take a stand it's it's fine that's all
[20:22] part of being a Christian you have to
[20:25] understand we're not supposed to be
[20:27] swimming with the current of everyone
[20:29] else we're supposed to be we're supposed
[20:32] to have a guide and it your guide my
[20:36] guide is not you you're your guide is
[20:39] not me your guide is Christ he's that of
[20:43] the church and so our purpose is simply
[20:46] to speak what's true if you don't
[20:51] appreciate it then don't appreciate it
[20:52] I'm not trying to hurt any feelings I'm
[20:55] not going out that way I love you that's
[20:59] why I want to speak what's true
[21:02] so we read that scripture already all
[21:07] that live godly in Christ Jesus shall
[21:09] suffer persecution so you're living in
[21:12] the world's completely contrary to the
[21:13] Word of God again I said before the
[21:18] kingdom of Christ is not in the kingdom
[21:20] of this world there contrary to each
[21:24] other in fact they're at war with each
[21:26] other
[21:28] sometimes we miss this these two
[21:30] kingdoms are in a spiritual war against
[21:33] each other and you're right in the
[21:37] middle and you should expect to be
[21:40] involved in this war and and how does
[21:43] how do you wage war and how does the
[21:46] devil's kingdom wage war the devil wages
[21:49] war by insults by trying to destroy you
[21:54] by trying to silence you any way that it
[21:58] can okay is that how we're supposed to
[22:00] wage war are we supposed to fight fire
[22:04] with fire we totally don't do that
[22:08] Christ told us a completely different
[22:10] way but if we're living godly according
[22:15] to the character of Jesus Christ with
[22:17] his life expressing that life we're
[22:20] living a spirit contrary to this current
[22:23] world order and system therefore we you
[22:26] will suffer persecution if you declare
[22:31] yourself to be a Christian and live only
[22:34] in your comfort zone keep things easy
[22:36] don't confront confront don't say
[22:40] anything hard don't take a stand just
[22:45] try to make everything simple for
[22:46] everyone you're giving yourself a false
[22:50] sense of peace and of course you're not
[22:52] going to suffer any persecution why
[22:55] would you because you're just making it
[22:57] easy for everybody you're making it
[23:00] simple you're not expressing the Spirit
[23:03] of God your your conforming to the
[23:07] Spirit of the world and you say well I'm
[23:09] a Christian I got the Holy Ghost that's
[23:10] not possible yes Paul Paul was speaking
[23:13] and writing to Christian
[23:15] in Romans 12 and he said do not be
[23:18] conformed to this world so you can be
[23:22] conformed to this world as a born-again
[23:25] Christian you can also choose to be
[23:29] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[23:32] but it's up to you to choose you have
[23:35] the freedom to choose now that you've
[23:37] been set free by Christ before you
[23:39] didn't have the freedom to choose you
[23:41] had the freeze and freedom to choose
[23:42] only sin because that's what your heart
[23:44] was bent towards and my heart was bent
[23:46] towards now that you're free you can
[23:49] choose I'm gonna be conformed to the
[23:50] world or I'm gonna be transformed by the
[23:52] renewing of my mind so if we think
[23:55] there's no persecution just a second I
[23:58] want to back up we got in the in the in
[24:01] thinking about the rapture and the bride
[24:05] will not go through the tribulation
[24:07] period she will not suffer the wrath of
[24:10] God but we can't take that and say we're
[24:13] not going to be persecuted in this age
[24:15] we're not going to suffer we're not
[24:18] gonna have to no we're not gonna be
[24:19] thrown into where God is pouring out his
[24:22] wrath that's absolutely true but to say
[24:26] that we're not going to be persecuted
[24:27] and we're not gonna suffer that's
[24:29] against the scripture completely against
[24:32] those are two different things that
[24:33] we're talking about I mean if you want
[24:35] to look and go through go through the
[24:37] line you can can recall different prayer
[24:39] requests and testimonies of people who
[24:42] have they believe this message standing
[24:45] for this message filled with the Holy
[24:47] Ghost and they've been in jail you know
[24:50] people have had their houses burnt down
[24:54] people face danger continuously because
[24:57] of in in India because of the Hindu
[25:01] nationalists there you know that those
[25:05] overt types of persecution are happening
[25:08] to the message believers in the brine
[25:11] all around the world you know in Russia
[25:14] they banned certain sermons and brother
[25:16] Branham and so churches are going to
[25:18] suffer because of that they're in China
[25:20] believe there's preachers that are in
[25:23] prison right now as we speak so we're
[25:26] going to be persecuted for the sake of
[25:29] right
[25:30] that's different than going through
[25:31] God's wrath and the tribulation so I
[25:36] think it would be safe to say based on
[25:39] Scripture that if we're not suffering
[25:41] any type of persecution well let me back
[25:46] up and just say it a different way we're
[25:49] not looking to suffer persecution we
[25:51] don't enjoy it in that sense we're not
[25:54] sadomasochists I can't wait until I get
[25:57] tortured for Christ no no we don't think
[26:00] that way that's not what we're taught
[26:02] that's not what Christ is talking about
[26:04] that's not the Christian response to
[26:07] suffering that we're just going to you
[26:08] know run full-tilt and do everything we
[26:11] can to become persecuted but if we're
[26:17] living for him truly we're going to
[26:20] receive I'll put it in a wait there's
[26:23] gonna be friction there's going to be
[26:26] people that do not like what you're
[26:28] doing there's gonna be people that
[26:30] express that they do not like what
[26:31] you're doing you might lose a job you
[26:35] you might have people try to kick you
[26:37] out of your home you might there might
[26:40] be things that happen in your life that
[26:43] are because you're speaking the truth to
[26:45] people and they hate you but if you're
[26:48] in silent you never speak the truth
[26:51] you'd never share that share the gospel
[26:54] you're you're never open with what
[26:57] you're standing for then you won't
[27:00] suffer persecution what should it be our
[27:04] response to being persecuted Matthew 5
[27:07] 10 through 12 blessed are they which are
[27:09] persecuted for righteousness sake for
[27:11] theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[27:13] blessed are you when men shall revile
[27:15] you and persecute you and shall say all
[27:18] manner of evil against you falsely for
[27:20] my name's sake rejoice and be exceeding
[27:23] glad for great is your reward in heaven
[27:25] for so persecuted they the prophets
[27:28] which were before you I'm going to read
[27:32] one more scripture and
[27:36] Luke chapter 6 verse 22 and 23 blessed
[27:41] are ye when men shall hate you and when
[27:43] they shall separate you from their
[27:44] company and shall reproach you and cast
[27:46] out your name as evil for the son of
[27:49] man's sake rejoice ye in that day and
[27:51] leap for joy for behold your reward is
[27:54] great in heaven for in the like manner
[27:56] did their fathers unto the prophets so
[28:02] now the picture are sometimes I get in
[28:05] my head growing up I spent a lot of time
[28:08] watching Michael Jordan play basketball
[28:11] and so this was kind of home that I was
[28:14] raised in and so we we spend a lot of
[28:17] time watching sports and playing sports
[28:20] but the picture I have is after Jordan
[28:24] made the game-winning shot you know
[28:26] early in his career against the
[28:28] Cleveland Cavaliers and it clock expires
[28:33] he runs back and he's just leaping in
[28:35] the air pumping his fist over and over
[28:37] and over again because they won the game
[28:40] that's what I picture us as Christians
[28:45] should be doing when we're persecuted
[28:47] when people revile your name when they
[28:51] literally blaspheme your name because of
[28:55] the stand that you take when they kick
[28:57] you out none of us liked any of these
[29:02] things none of us want any of those
[29:04] things none of that none of us are
[29:06] setting out to do things to receive that
[29:09] but when we do there's something inside
[29:13] of us that should happen it should cause
[29:16] us to pray for those people it should
[29:20] cause us to love those people agape love
[29:23] it should cause us to forgive those
[29:25] people and then because of that we're
[29:28] suffering because of the name of Jesus
[29:30] Christ we should literally leap for joy
[29:33] because we've won a championship we've
[29:38] won the greatest honor in the world to
[29:41] suffer for the sake of the Son of Man
[29:44] and so I just I want to encourage you
[29:49] to change your mind about the suffering
[29:54] that you experience because of your
[29:56] faith I want you to change your mind
[29:58] change how you look at it don't be sad
[30:02] don't be upset don't be hurt summertime
[30:05] sometimes your greatest wounds comes in
[30:08] the house of that your friends what am I
[30:11] saying
[30:11] sometimes your biggest hurts are from
[30:13] church people that you love so much why
[30:16] because you opened your heart up to them
[30:18] don't stop opening your heart don't stop
[30:21] loving don't hate them
[30:26] love them pray for them and leap for joy
[30:29] because if you're getting friction
[30:31] because you're taking a stand for him
[30:33] and doing what he wants you to do it now
[30:36] if you're just being ordinary and people
[30:37] are upset at you that's a different
[30:39] thing but if you're if you're taking a
[30:42] stand for him and you're speaking truth
[30:46] to people with love then understand you
[30:50] don't have any reason to be upset or
[30:52] hurt don't be hurt why was Christ
[30:56] mortally offended when they called him
[30:57] Beelzebub we're to be molded into the
[31:00] image of Jesus Christ
[31:02] so let's our should we be mortally
[31:04] offended when somebody insults us come
[31:06] on we have I've got so much more to
[31:10] cover here but there's there's a reason
[31:15] for our joy in the midst of suffering
[31:18] there's a reason that we can love
[31:20] there's a reason we can forgive there's
[31:22] a reason we don't have to be mortally
[31:23] wounded when someone says something
[31:25] against us we have some another place
[31:28] we're living for and another person that
[31:30] we're living for in a different City
[31:32] we're looking to appear amen let's stand
[31:34] up and pray gracious Heavenly Father we
[31:39] love you so much Lord we just want to
[31:42] count it all joy we want to rejoice
[31:45] always Lord we don't we don't have to be
[31:50] full of sorrow because of suffering and
[31:52] difficulties we have a resource of joy
[31:57] that we can draw upon
[32:01] we have a heavenly vision a heavenly
[32:04] city that belongs to us we have a hope
[32:07] that you will wipe all tears away
[32:09] there'll be no more suffering no more
[32:12] pain so whatever we endure for the
[32:15] moment is just a momentary light
[32:18] affliction can't even be compared to
[32:21] what you have prepared for us help us to
[32:25] have this new vision help our minds to
[32:27] be renewed Lord we give ourselves to you
[32:29] in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[32:32] god bless you
