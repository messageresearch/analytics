TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Good morning. Good morning. That's better. Let's all stand. Have a word of prayer before we get started. Father, we just thank you for this time we have to come together. Lord, I pray may you be with this this portion of the service this morning. May your spirit just come and anoint the lips, anoint the ears. Father, may you bless the bless this day, Lord, and bless our brothers preparing for the main service. Father, I pray Jesus name. Amen. I want to read in Luke chapter 9 verse 23. And he said to them all, if any man will come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. May God have a blessing you to have your seats. for a title I for this little portion I want to speak on it's like crucified with Christ or I should say what the cross actually means to us you know we're in a season where we'll hear a lot about about Calvary a lot about the cross it's Easter coming we'll hear all kinds and we don't want to downgrade what the cross means to us because the cross means a lot to us you know you you hear Jesus when if you read in in the scriptures Jesus, he'll talk more about his cross than he did his resurrection. And he tells us in here's Luke that, you know, deny yourself, take up your cross and follow me. So he's there's a lot in a statement crucified with Christ. It means so much to us as a believer. You know, it means it's atonement for our sin. It means the cross represents the atonement of sin where Jesus took on the punishment for us. Took all of our sins upon himself. It also gives us a new life. Through the cross and the resurrection, we're offered eternal life with him. It's your identity and your belonging. So what's your identify? The cross signifies belonging to Christ. So we are identified with his sacrifice because we were in him when he died. I'll go ahead and say we were also in him when he resurrected. It's our hope and assurance. The cross is our source of hope, assurance of God's love and his promise of salvation. It's a call to follow him. We're his disciples. Because the cross serves as a reminder of of of a call to follow Jesus, which was in this scripture. It involves our sacrifice and taking up one's own cross. It's also a victory over sin and death. So the cross signifies God's love. Remember when God's love when he was in the beginning in the garden of Eden when Adam and Eve did what they did and fell and God put the lamb skins on them and they were leaving the garden. You know the prophet tells a very touching story of that that skin the skins were slapping their leg that some god had so much love he says I won't leave you that way I will make a way for you. So when he comes down for the cross signifies his love and his sacrifice and what a sacrifice that God did that God came down into a into a virgin woman and made himself a body and then what kind of sacrifice did he do for us you know we hear we'll hear the story of the garden of Gethsemane what he happened what happened there in the garden where Jesus was even praying and great drops of blood would the sweat would be like like drops of blood he was such agony and he was doing that just for us. And then when he went into Calvary or went to Pilate's hall and they beat him with the whips and the chunks of flesh was coming off his back was just for us. The importance of Calvary. That's being crucified with Christ. And he then he put those crown of thorns upon his head and that blood just dripping down. And what agony that he just did just for you, Enoch. He just did it for each one of us. What a sacrifice that he did because he knew what Calvary was going to do for us. because Calvary can do a lot. You know, how many believers do we have here this morning? Praise God. Or we're all believers. So, we're not down wanting to downgrade the importance of the cross because it's very important because the cross made everything possible for us. It brought redemption. It brought healing. It brought us power. Thank God. We need power in this day. All the things that the cross did made everything possible. So Jesus went to the cross one time. Now he didn't have to go every day for us. One time was enough for him to go to Calvary, but he was telling us that we need to go every day. That we need to because he says, "Take up your cross and follow me daily. Not just once a week. on Sunday when we come to church we'll crucify ourel but he said you need to die to yourself daily so what happened with Jesus he would take up what to take up that cross means he picked up that cross drug it down the streets of headed up toward Calvary for his death so that's what what we need to do we need to bring our cross and we need to come in here and we need to kill ourselves we need to take ourselves up to nail ourselves to the cross daily I need to take myself daily and nail my hands to the cross and kill this flesh. We should but you know we should glory in the crucifixion in such gory and you know such agony that we seem but we should glory in in the crucifixion because Paul says in Galatians 6:14 but God forbid that I should glory that God forbid that I should glory and what if you read the scriptures before this these men were telling the the people that they need to get circumcised and then then when they did they were taken to glory for It said they got it because I said so. And it's not it's like you hear I hear a lot of preachers talking which is a shame. I had this great meeting. I went to this meeting. So many people come to the altar when I was preaching the word and bragging on it. You know it's just a different you hear some people say you know I was preaching and God brought all these they gave glory to God but these men were bringing glory to themselves. Paul says, "God forbid that I should even glory in this, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world was crucified unto me, and I unto the world." I like the NLT version of this of this scripture. It says, "Has for me, may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ." because of that cross. He says, "My interest in the world has been crucified." Thank God. How many interests of this world? I have no interest in this world. It's dead to me. When you've been crucified with Christ, this world is dead to you. You know, when you when you when you got saved and used to be out in the world and your friends and you party and used to be the party animal, your friends, what happened to you? used used to be fun. You you you you hosted some awesome parties. We loved you. The world loved us cuz we were they love cuz we were we were fun to be around. We used to drink. What happened to you? A new man has been formed. The old man has been dead. The new man has come to life. You say, "Yeah, I used to do all those things, but not anymore because I have been crucified with Christ." What does crucified mean? It means to mortify. It's death. So when you must die to the world, be ye not conformed to this world, but transformed by the renewing of your mind. Because Romans 8:13 says, "For if you live after the flesh, you shall die. But if you live through the spirit, you do mortify, which is kill the flesh, the deeds of this body, and you're going to live. So I die daily. So mortification means to means death. So I'm going to kill myself so I can live. Lord, what do you do when someone dies? We have a funeral. They'll they'll they'll bring them right up here and set the casket in front of the front of the altar here. and you come by and you give your respects. You look down in here and you might shed a few tears and tell the family, "I'm so sorry. My condolences. Sorry for your loss. You, that man's buried. He's dead." So, what do we do? How many brought your casket here this morning? I brought mine. And I already got my headstone already prepared. Here lies Brad Y. He died today. Of course, Brad Jon says he's died several times this week because what Paul says, I die daily. So, we're crucifi we're being crucified. So, we're dying daily. Paul says, I protest by re your rejoicing which I have in Christ, Jesus our Lord. I die daily. He was expressing the idea of putting aside his own desires and his own ambitions to follow Christ more closely. It reflects a daily commitment to self-denial and spiritual growth, acknowledging the need to overcome challenges and remain faithful. So when Paul is saying, I am crucified with Christ, but yet I live, that's what Galatians 2:20 says, I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live, yet not I. So it's not I or anything that I could have ever done, but it was Christ that liveth in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, this new life that I live, even though I'm still in this flesh, he's saying, I live by the faith of the son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. The NLT verse says, "My old self has been crucified with Christ. It's no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. So I live in his earthly body by trusting in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me. Listen to what brother said about this. He said now if we don't if we want to see him he says if you ever expect to see how many wants to see him I'm going to tell you what you have to do. If you ever expect to see him, you'll never see him by joining a church, signing your name to some book, some creed you serve. You'll see him when you die. I'm not talking about the end of our road death. It's coming. But he says when you come to Calvary and are crucified to yourself, then you'll see Jesus. Thank the Lord. You'll find Jesus at the cross when you're crucified with him. You cannot find him until you die to yourself and accept him, the word. Then you find life. He says, "A real true disciple will bring you right straight into the presence of Christ. And from there, Christ will show you what you had to do." Ain't you thankful for real men of God? They won't lead. They're not leading you to themselves. Brother Jason, don't stand up here and point to himself. That's why he has the assistant pastor on his door back here. He's leading you to somebody, not himself. Brother Matt's not leading you to himself. Brother JD, who's going to be speaking a little bit. He's not leading you to himself. He's got all we all got one thing in mind. That's to lead you to Jesus Christ. We're not pointing to some church. We're pointing you to Christ. But it says, "And when you get a real disciple that appoints you to Christ, Christ will bring you to the cross where you are crucified with him." Romans 6:6 says, "Knowing this, that our old man, our old sinful selves is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should we should serve, we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin." So when we died with Christ, we were set free by the power of sin. So what happens when you're dead with Christ? I love this statement right here. His eternal life and your life meets together and your life dies and you take on his eternal life, then you're a son of God. Hallelujah. Jesus was Jesus pointed to his death saying I must die so you can live. But Jesus he he says in Matthew 16:25 verse 24 then said Jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me. He says, "I'll point you to a place where I'm going to be I'm going to be crucified for you. And in there, if you'll be crucified with me and take up your cross and follow me, you'll know who I am." So, we don't even know who Christ is until we're actually die to ourselves, till we're actually crucified. Until we go in there. What a statement. We're going to go in there with him. how different it is. He said, "But your life, your life and his life found each other." Thank the Lord. Not at not at the church, not in a building, not in some creed, not in your good works. We have a lot of good works, but you're not going to find Christ in our good works. The only way you're going to find Christ is at the cross, where you are crucified with him. That's where you find him. You won't find him by doing better. We won't find him by turn over a new leaf. Every New Year's Day, I'm going to be different. I'm turn over a new leaf this year. I'm going to be totally different what I was last year in January the 2nd. You're back the same way you were in December 31st. Amen. Everybody says again, a true servant takes you to him and he is the word. And you'll say, 'Well, brother Brandham, if Christ is on earth today, a real servant would take him would take him to him, Christ. Well, Christ is here in the form of his word, and the word brings life because he is the word. Because it's the spirit that quickth John 6:63 says, the spirit that quickth the flesh profitth nothing. The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life. So, the spirit alone gives eternal life. Human effort accomplishes nothing. And the very works I have spoken to you are spirit and life. So Christ is the word. He is the word himself. The true servant always takes you to the word. He is the word. He is he is this Bible made living. And when you die to yourself with Christ, it's like a corn of wheat, you know. Then the word lives in you and it brings forth the same results as it did that in that living corn of wheat that had to drop into the earth signifying Jesus dying going to earth and rising back up. This is what dying does. It makes you partakers of his resurrection. You're partakers with him. So when we die, this is what happens. We're partakers with him. some of his blessings on what he feels like given at the moment. All his blessings. He's not just going to give what he feels like. Well, I think you just deserve this. I'm not going to give you nothing else. He gives you all the blessings in all of the manifestations. You're partakers with him in all that he did. It's all because of Calvary. All because of Calvary. Now, if you're a son and daughter of God, then you were in God at the beginning. You're his attribute. If you weren't, if you weren't there then, you never were never will be. Sons and daughters of God that were in God in the beginning. Now look, you got eternal life. We believe it that we got eternal life. How many believes you got eternal life? So if you don't, don't leave here without it. There is only one form of eternal life and that's God. That's the only thing that is eternal. is God. Then if you got eternal life, that life that's in you always was and you were in the loins of God before there even was a world. Jesus himself was the word. And in St. John 1, it says, "In the beginning was the word and word was with God." We know the scriptures. So then you were in the loins of Jesus and you went to Calvary with him. You died with him. You raised with him. And so today you're sitting in heavenly places with him. That's what Ephesians 2 says. And raised us together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. For he raised us up from the dead along with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly in the heavenly places because we are united with him. that in the ages to come. Verse se verse seven, that he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through Christ. So God can point us to all future ages as example of his wealth of his grace and kindness toward us has shown in all he has done for us who are united with Christ Jesus. Today we're sitting in heavenly places in him filled with his spirit, sons and daughters of God. We die with him. We raise with him. Sure, we was in his own we was in God's own thinking. God the great spirit in the beginning before there was was a beginning. He was God. Did you know that you were in him then? If you are a Christian now, you were in him then. It's the whole Godhead shaped in you. All because of Calvary. All because of you being crucified with him. So when Jesus died at the cross, I died with him. For as as I was in him then, for he was the fullness of the word made manifest, knowing that he we would manifest that we would manifest later, and we were at Calvary with him. We went to the grave with him, and we were raised with him in his resurrection. Romans 6:3 says, "Know you not that as many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?" He said, ' Or have you even forgotten that we were joined with Christ Jesus in baptism? We were joined with him at at his death. Therefore, we are buried with him by his baptism into death like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of of the father. Even so, we also should walk in the newness of life. Re says, "Now we've ascended. We've ascended by his spirit to the throne of grace. We are today sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus always. You mean to tell me even though all hell is breaking loose, everything is going wrong, nothing goes right, we are still sitting in heavenly places. Man, it's powerful. He says, "For as a germ of natural life is brought down, germmitized from father to father to father." So who whatever you are was passed down from your great-grandfather to your grandfather to your dad to you and you'll pass on down to your son. So is the life of Christ germatized. The real you. This germ started in the Garden of Eden. It started there when Jesus made a sacrifice. When he took the lambs, he killed the He killed the lamb and put the the skins on them. He started something. He went on down through the to the bulls and goats. That germ seed bringing it on down from generation to generation till it come to Christ. And that germ seed went inside Christ when he died at Calvary. He sent that same germ seed of life to you on the day of Pentecost. So we actually have that today. So this germ was passed down from generation to generation is for you and your children or as many as our Lord our God shall call. That's the reason that God used Elijah's spirit five different times. It's a handing down of that same germ life. The handing down in where in Jesus God made me pay for my sins in him there and then he rose me with him in the resurrection. Now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil. That's what crucified Christ means to me. I have victory over everything. Over every devil. Not just one, every devil. He says if you could believe what God has given and you're not seated there and you don't have it. And if you're se if you're not if you're seated there and don't believe it and afraid to move, you'll never use it. But if you are seated there, you will use it. For you are ordained to do what you do. Just remember when you were in your father's loins, you were with him. Let me skip something here real quick. Luke 9:23, I'm about finished. He said to them, or I'm about out of time, not finished. He said to them, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself," which is means to disown, to have no acquaintance with. So you're supposed to have no acquaintance with yourself daily. Forget who you are. Jesus calls for every believer to live a daily life of commitment, sacrifice, self-denial. It don't mean that you're going to be beaten. But Josh, I ain't going to take a a whip and beat you this morning. It don't mean that, but it's something you have to do. You have to to to die daily. Self sacrifice. When you think about what God did for you, all that punishment, I said at the beginning, all that punishment that he went for for you, and sometimes we we can't hardly get out of bed on Sunday morning. Oh gosh, I got to go to church. Wednesday's even tough, too. I've worked all day. Sacrifice. We can go even further into that. We won't we won't do that. Every day should be a good Friday. I am crucified with Christ, but yet I live. Hallelujah. I'm going to stop right there. It's about time. God bless you. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
