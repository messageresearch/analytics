[0:00] gap
[0:01] and daniel's seen the first peak of the
[0:03] messiah prince and then he sees the
[0:04] second coming of that messiah when jesus
[0:07] comes back what daniel doesn't see is
[0:09] that in between the first coming of the
[0:11] messiah and the second coming there's a
[0:14] gap
[0:15] and that gap is called seven church ages
[0:18] and you live in that gap
[0:22] and daniel doesn't see any all daniel

[9:14] move on into the anointed word and
[9:17] father
[9:18] we have a presentation we want to bring
[9:20] to the church and there's been so much
[9:23] thought now put into it but where we
[9:26] know lord that it needs an anointing
[9:28] from you
[9:29] lord for the people to catch the same
[9:32] anointing and the same vision father we
[9:35] want to be all on the same page so we're
[9:37] asking that of thee this morning that
[9:40] you'll give our brother lord liberty to
[9:43] open his heart lord and speak to the
[9:45] people we commit it to you in jesus name
[9:48] god bless you friends you can be seated
[9:50] praise the lord god bless you brother
[9:52] good to have you here today amen
[9:54] different ones of you
[9:55] so uh
[9:57] we've been working on this for quite a
[9:59] while
[10:00] and
[10:00] brother kinney has
[10:03] really spent a lot of time
[10:05] um first he had to really digest and
[10:08] assimilate the vision
[10:10] that that i had and to try to really
[10:12] understand what we're moving toward
[10:14] and you know he's then then of course
[10:17] there's the preparation on how to
[10:19] communicate that to you because i think
[10:22] you want to know and i think that
[10:24] knowing is helpful and so i want you to
[10:27] give brother ken your undivided
[10:29] attention he's
[10:31] heading up our fundraising activities
[10:34] and
[10:35] our plans and ideas and it's still
[10:38] moving on you know we're always open to
[10:41] other ideas and we're not saying today
[10:44] that we're putting a period behind
[10:46] anything you're going to hear we're
[10:47] always open to good ideas continuing so
[10:51] i wanted us to ask you to give brother
[10:52] ken your undivided attention and he's
[10:55] going to take just a little bit and then
[10:56] we will start up the worship service
[10:58] straight away after that did you enjoy
[11:00] the sunday school class
[11:02] hey man i was enjoying it listening in
[11:04] the back praise god
[11:06] brother kenny come my brother
[11:11] and he'll just use this
[11:13] guys
[11:21] hey man is this the clicker i'm not sure
[11:24] how you use this
[11:35] all right good morning bethel family
[11:37] how's everyone this morning
[11:41] first of all i'd like to just say uh
[11:45] no questions brother jason specified
[11:47] that to keep the time under control
[11:50] if you have questions feel free to talk
[11:53] to me or brother jason or brother matt
[11:55] anytime after this
[11:57] we're going to try to keep this before
[11:59] you so there's going to be meetings mate
[12:02] or you know presentations maybe every
[12:04] few weeks
[12:05] keep everybody updated on how we're
[12:07] moving forward
[12:09] um
[12:10] so i just want to start by saying you
[12:12] know brother matt and brother jason have
[12:14] presented to the church their vision for
[12:17] the church moving forward
[12:19] talking about beautifying the church and
[12:22] possibly adding on to the church
[12:24] and i'm up here today to explain a
[12:26] little more about the direction moving
[12:28] forward
[12:29] as we fell out of the lord
[12:32] our building project started with the
[12:33] vision our ministry team
[12:36] has for the future of bethel tabernacle
[12:38] today we're going to talk about taking
[12:39] ownership of that vision
[12:44] so i just wanted to i presented made
[12:46] this presentation
[12:47] i'm not really a
[12:50] formal speaker at all and you're going
[12:52] to find that out over the course of the
[12:53] next 15 or 20 minutes i don't know which
[12:56] button to push here brother jason
[13:01] to go forward i see
[13:04] so i'm just i i copied and pasted a few
[13:06] of these pictures of the church
[13:10] that brother steve put together for us
[13:13] and i wanted to present these for us and
[13:15] then um
[13:17] move into the slide show that i
[13:20] created i'm taking ownership of the
[13:22] vision
[13:23] and scripture says in proverbs 29 18
[13:26] that without where there is no vision
[13:28] the people will perish well brother
[13:30] jason and brother matt
[13:32] have definitely got a vision for our
[13:34] church moving forward
[13:37] and they've tasked me and asked me to
[13:39] help create and facilitate this
[13:41] fundraising drive because of my
[13:43] experience doing that up in toledo
[13:45] and michigan area with brother paul
[13:48] and
[13:49] that was years ago
[13:52] since we relocated here to buffer years
[13:54] ago
[13:55] the brothers there in ohio and michigan
[13:58] they carried on with brother paul's
[14:00] vision and if you ask brother jason the
[14:02] lord has really blessed the church up
[14:04] there
[14:05] a member of the jason
[14:07] they have quite a facility of quite a
[14:09] church building and grounds there
[14:11] and not comparing ourselves to that but
[14:14] i just want to remind everyone if you
[14:16] have seen what they have going on up
[14:18] there with their building and their
[14:19] facility if you've watched any of their
[14:21] services online
[14:23] we serve the same god
[14:25] amen
[14:27] and we just we can't put past what god
[14:30] can do for us
[14:32] so i'd like to start off with the
[14:34] mission of the church
[14:37] so go go ye therefore
[14:40] and teach all nations baptizing them in
[14:42] the name of the father son and of the
[14:44] holy ghost and we know that by
[14:47] revelation of the hour that that means
[14:48] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[14:52] teaching them to observe all things
[14:54] whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i
[14:57] am with you always and even unto the end
[14:59] of the world
[15:01] so basically
[15:03] he's commanding us to go find the gene
[15:05] seed of god
[15:06] baptize them
[15:08] teach them to be like jesus and lead
[15:10] them to the baptism of the holy ghost
[15:13] when i asked brother jason what was his
[15:16] vision for the church and
[15:18] how you know as it relates to the great
[15:20] commission and and then preparing us as
[15:23] the bride of christ for the
[15:24] rapture so he's he uh
[15:27] his vision really astounded me
[15:30] but jason said you know and after i sent
[15:32] the text he said brother ken i really
[15:34] want to take some time to
[15:36] think this through because i don't want
[15:38] to give just a short answer i want the
[15:40] people really to catch what uh what my
[15:42] heart is and what the lord's given me
[15:45] and so this is what he sent me
[15:48] he said
[15:50] i have always envisioned a church as a
[15:52] vibrant base from which to work
[15:54] constantly for the master
[15:56] an assembly that is not merely another
[15:58] church on the corner instead one with an
[16:02] atmosphere
[16:03] pulsating with faith and activity
[16:06] 365 days a year not a mere meeting house
[16:09] a couple of times a week
[16:11] i think we all can agree that we're
[16:12] definitely not just a
[16:14] a meeting house a couple times a week or
[16:17] you know merely just another church on
[16:19] the corner and that we definitely create
[16:21] an atmosphere pulsating with faith and
[16:23] activity
[16:25] by the grace of god
[16:30] okay
[16:33] he said
[16:35] i see it as a place for gathering the
[16:36] family of god around the feast of the
[16:38] word fostering and fostering and
[16:41] propagating the work of the kingdom in
[16:43] every possible way a place where
[16:46] spiritual vision thrives and inspiration
[16:49] is multiplied in the hearts and minds of
[16:52] the saints who gather there
[16:54] so let's look at fostering and gathering
[16:57] that means
[16:58] nurturing encouraging and further
[17:01] spreading and growing so
[17:04] here we are trying to foster
[17:07] and propagate
[17:09] the kingdom of god in our hearts among
[17:11] one another but also projecting it to
[17:14] others amen
[17:16] a place where spiritual vision thrives i
[17:19] just said wow
[17:21] and how are you a church this is a
[17:23] question how are you thriving
[17:25] in the spiritual vision
[17:27] for the church
[17:28] and i want all of you to think about
[17:30] that as we go through this presentation
[17:37] all my life being raised in message
[17:39] ranks i have observed that the
[17:41] assemblies god blesses the most are
[17:44] those who constantly lift their eyes to
[17:46] the field of war of the world
[17:48] and have missions work on the forefront
[17:50] of their agenda bethel tabernacles
[17:52] should have a leading purpose to go or
[17:55] send someone and through the years we've
[17:57] done that saints of god we've always
[18:00] supported missions work overseas since
[18:02] i've been here i can testify to that
[18:05] as such we need an efficient facility
[18:08] maximizing every gift and office of the
[18:11] ministry and among the saints for
[18:14] foreign missions and local evangelism
[18:18] i'm going to read that again
[18:19] as such we need an efficient facility
[18:22] maximizing every gift and office of the
[18:25] ministry and among the saints of foreign
[18:27] missions and local evangelism
[18:32] that's powerful you know brother branham
[18:34] says
[18:35] he when he talks about the bride that
[18:37] they'll be sighing and crying for the
[18:38] lost
[18:40] are we doing that i just want to i just
[18:42] want to remember remind everybody that
[18:44] this is really important saints that's
[18:46] part of the great commission
[18:48] that's what we're here for
[18:51] we're here to be effective witnesses
[18:55] not just witnesses but effective
[18:57] witnesses we can be good witnesses with
[19:00] our with our words but if we're not
[19:02] living what we are saying the people
[19:04] won't catch it
[19:07] it's like you know if brother jason
[19:08] brother matt brother j.d you know
[19:11] brother any of these other ministers
[19:13] they get up and then they preach the
[19:15] word but then they go live in any old
[19:16] way we're not going to follow what
[19:18] they're teaching we're not going to
[19:19] catch that vision
[19:21] it'll be an intellectual you know
[19:23] knowledge we're gaining
[19:28] i envision a church as a place where
[19:30] people and families can come together to
[19:32] worship in spirit and truth
[19:34] and find the healing strength and
[19:36] confidence to be part of something
[19:38] larger than themselves serving an
[19:40] eternal purpose
[19:42] until the master calls us home
[19:44] it will be worth every effort all for
[19:47] one one for all a family of god
[19:51] isn't that beautiful
[19:54] being part of something larger than
[19:56] ourselves and serving an eternal purpose
[19:59] oh amen that's what i want
[20:04] so it's obvious that the ministry is
[20:06] laying a foundation of the vision of the
[20:08] church of today and tomorrow
[20:11] so our our us here today
[20:14] and then the youngins as they come up
[20:17] we've got uh we've all got to take part
[20:20] of this vision and take ownership of it
[20:22] parents you're doing you know you're
[20:24] doing this for your children and your
[20:26] grandchildren
[20:27] young adults and children this is for
[20:29] you
[20:30] this vision that brother jason has isn't
[20:33] just for us as a you know for a now this
[20:36] is for if the lord tarries we move
[20:38] forward
[20:39] so god's already raising up young
[20:41] preachers to carry this ministry up
[20:43] right here among us we got you know
[20:46] brother caleb brother matthew smith he's
[20:48] raising up you knew
[20:50] young musicians and singers we got
[20:52] brother mason on the drums brother enoch
[20:55] he's quite a singer
[20:57] amen
[20:59] and some of you other young people are
[21:01] and children are going to you know
[21:02] possibly be future trustees deacons
[21:05] wives of pastors sunday school teachers
[21:07] musicians all that
[21:10] church can you see the vision can you
[21:12] see yourself in this vision
[21:16] well i sure wish this was you up here
[21:17] brother george
[21:19] brother george is a much better uh
[21:22] speaker as far as presentations go amen
[21:27] so
[21:29] i believe with all my heart
[21:32] let me change this
[21:34] each of us
[21:36] must personally catch
[21:38] trust and agree with and operate in the
[21:41] vision of our pastor
[21:44] this is taking ownership of the vision
[21:46] you believe it
[21:48] all right
[21:53] so we are a body and as part of the body
[21:55] we all have a purpose
[21:57] we all must do something to be part of
[21:59] that vision
[22:00] we all can't be hands we all can't be
[22:02] feet and arms and legs we all are our
[22:05] separate
[22:06] part of that body and we all have a
[22:09] purpose
[22:10] i'm asking you this morning to think
[22:12] about what part you play what do you see
[22:15] yourself as in this vision
[22:21] so what is your vision of the church
[22:23] saints
[22:24] the rapture
[22:27] amen mine too ultimately
[22:29] amen we're all looking forward to that
[22:32] but we must keep planting potatoes and
[22:34] we should live like it's you know going
[22:37] to be tomorrow
[22:39] it left
[22:40] amen
[22:42] the rapture
[22:43] we should live like it's going to be
[22:45] tomorrow but playing like it's going to
[22:46] be a hundred years from now
[22:49] amen
[22:51] we also need to envision spiritual
[22:52] growth for all of us for each one of us
[22:55] as individuals
[22:57] to pray praying that we'll draw closer
[22:59] to the lord
[23:03] okay
[23:08] the low country
[23:10] and growth from new souls
[23:13] can you say amen
[23:16] i know brother i don't think brother
[23:17] rowan's here but i sure would love to
[23:20] see about 20 or 30 more brother rowan's
[23:22] walk in those doors
[23:24] amen and just catch the
[23:26] the revelation of what god is doing
[23:28] right now
[23:31] i want everyone to look around we have a
[23:33] nice group of young families here with
[23:35] young children that will be teens in a
[23:37] blink of an eye trust me on that
[23:40] men are all grown up now i have you know
[23:43] three grandchildren
[23:44] and hopefully more if the lord tarries
[23:48] i want you to think of this you know we
[23:51] have a nice group of of single young
[23:53] adults here right now that are of

[26:09] about half of our church here
[26:15] what happens if the lord tarries another
[26:17] year or two
[26:19] i mean on a regular sunday if everyone's
[26:22] here there's not enough room for
[26:24] everyone to sit as it is
[26:27] so you can see how this is all playing
[26:29] into the vision that brother brother
[26:31] jason brother matt have been talking
[26:33] about you can have your seats
[26:37] we have some amazing additions that the
[26:39] lord has brought to to make our
[26:42] church more complete we've brought some
[26:44] additional
[26:46] members to our worship team and great
[26:48] gifted singers here
[26:50] amen some additions to our ministry team
[26:54] we got brother jd and his sister amy
[26:56] here helping in that area
[26:59] amen
[27:02] let's see
[27:04] oh we can't forget brother brad and
[27:06] sister sarah
[27:08] amen
[27:10] we've got uh trustees and i texted
[27:13] brother mark and brother george and
[27:14] asked them how long they've been here
[27:16] it's been seven years already
[27:18] wow how time flies
[27:22] we've got deacon brother brother uh
[27:24] luther in the back there how long you
[27:26] been here brother luther
[27:29] [Music]
[27:30] it seems it seems like yesterday that
[27:33] brother luther got here amen we've got
[27:36] our young people taken over the booth
[27:38] for us that's growth within our own
[27:41] church that these brothers probably
[27:43] won't leave they'll be here and they'll
[27:46] have families
[27:47] just some examples of what god's doing
[27:50] how many prayer warriors god relocated
[27:53] here with us amongst you i'm not just
[27:54] mentioning the ones that are visual
[27:56] because god has body parts that can't be
[27:58] seen
[28:00] amen remember also brother jason talk to
[28:03] us about two or three more families that
[28:05] are planning to move here and join our
[28:07] assembly in the next few months in the
[28:09] coming months and one of those families
[28:11] has 10 believers
[28:13] amen and i've talked to other believers
[28:15] that go to this assembly and said rumor
[28:17] has it there are other families that are
[28:20] planning to move here and praying that
[28:22] the lord show them if this is where he
[28:24] wants them
[28:25] so where could we be
[28:27] in just a matter of three or four months
[28:31] not to mention a year or two or three or
[28:33] four if the lord tarries
[28:37] i want to talk about the visitors how
[28:39] many visitors we got here you won't have
[28:40] to stand up just raise your hand
[28:43] okay we got three four five and brother
[28:46] larry and y'all aren't really you're
[28:48] really not a visitor yeah but we got we
[28:50] got we got three visitors here this
[28:53] morning
[28:54] and that's probably getting too close to
[28:56] about average
[28:57] three to four visitors a week on sundays
[29:01] and that's wonderful but what happens if
[29:03] if we get out there and do the
[29:05] evangelizing of the low country how many
[29:08] more visitors will we have
[29:10] a week and isn't that the ultimate goal
[29:14] to bring people in here so that they can
[29:18] be watered if they're a seed of god
[29:22] amen
[29:23] that's where the vision's going saints
[29:26] some of the believers that are are
[29:28] visiting here they may even be from
[29:30] other churches
[29:32] that are in the message but they're just
[29:33] praying
[29:34] that the lord would god stir in their
[29:37] hearts maybe to make some changes
[29:39] like brother brad and sister sarah most
[29:41] recently god would stern in their hearts
[29:44] to
[29:45] to to to make some changes god was
[29:47] leading them here
[29:49] but when they you know but when the some
[29:51] visitors come in and they look on a
[29:53] sunday and they see
[29:54] there's only three seats available in
[29:57] the church and i got six in my family
[30:00] that's a discouragement
[30:02] so i know everybody understands where
[30:04] the part of the vision i'm going towards
[30:06] is that we need more room we need more
[30:08] square footage brother brother matt was
[30:11] talking about beautifying the inside but
[30:14] that also kind of types
[30:16] what god's doing to us he's beautifying
[30:19] us
[30:20] and we're all growing
[30:22] spiritually
[30:24] not just in numbers but as individuals
[30:26] so if you type that with the natural
[30:30] we're beautifying the church we are the
[30:32] church we're being beautified and we're
[30:34] beautifying the church
[30:36] we're growing as individuals as the
[30:38] church of god and i think it's time that
[30:40] this church grows
[30:42] in the natural
[30:44] amen
[30:46] so however you come here as a visitor we
[30:49] want to know that everyone that there's
[30:51] we want the visitors to know that
[30:53] there's room for them and comfortable
[30:55] not we're not piling up on one another
[30:57] amen
[31:00] all right
[31:01] so i'm gonna skip
[31:03] we're just gonna go through a few of
[31:04] these um pictures
[31:08] uh once again brother matt already
[31:10] presented them to us
[31:12] but
[31:13] we're gonna keep these in the forefront
[31:15] of our mind because
[31:17] this is um what we'd like to see the
[31:19] church become who wouldn't who doesn't
[31:21] want to see that raise your hand who
[31:22] doesn't want to see that
[31:25] all right
[31:28] so see you all you all are on
[31:30] board all right
[31:33] in such such i just want to say thanks
[31:35] again brother steve for the
[31:38] all the time and energy he's put into
[31:40] putting these things together plans are
[31:43] about ready so that we can get uh send
[31:46] them out to the contractors and get them
[31:49] uh
[31:50] get them to do some bids for us accurate
[31:53] bids so we can start looking at what the
[31:55] pricing and cost is going to be
[31:59] so how many so far wants to take
[32:00] ownership of the vision this morning by
[32:03] a show of hands i think there's a few
[32:04] out there that got their hands up brad
[32:07] come on
[32:09] i i'm showing you
[32:10] i'm showing
[32:12] you foreign all right
[32:16] so
[32:17] here i'd like to just share a couple
[32:19] examples of when god's people caught a
[32:21] vision and he had and they took
[32:23] ownership of it here in exodus 35
[32:26] it actually starts with verse five but
[32:28] we're just going to kind of skip through
[32:30] for time
[32:32] take you from among you and offering
[32:33] unto the lord whosoever is of a willing
[32:36] heart and i highlighted that because
[32:38] your heart has to be willing you can't
[32:39] give begrudgingly or else it doesn't
[32:42] count
[32:43] let him bring it an offering of the lord
[32:46] gold and silver and brass and blue and
[32:48] purple and scarlet and fine linen goes
[32:51] on
[32:52] and every wise hearted among you shall
[32:54] come and make all that the lord hath
[32:56] commanded
[32:57] the tabernacle his tent the ark and the
[32:59] staves thereof
[33:01] with the mercy seat and the veil of the
[33:03] covering and they came everyone whose
[33:05] heart stirred him up and everyone whom
[33:07] his spirit made willing and they brought
[33:10] the lord's offering to do the work of
[33:11] the tabernacle
[33:13] of the congregation and for all his
[33:16] service the children of israel brought a
[33:18] willing offering unto the lord
[33:20] every man
[33:22] not some men every man
[33:25] and woman
[33:26] whose heart made them willing to bring
[33:29] for all manner of work which the lord
[33:31] had commanded to be made by the hand of
[33:34] moses
[33:37] and then if we go a little bit further
[33:39] this is still the same situation this is
[33:42] being read in niv
[33:44] in exodus 36
[33:46] then moses summoned every skilled person
[33:49] whom the lord had given ability and who
[33:51] was willing to come and do the work they
[33:54] received from moses all the offerings
[33:56] israelites had brought to carry out the
[33:58] work of construction in the sanctuary
[34:01] and the people continued to bring free
[34:03] will offerings morning and morning
[34:05] morning after morning free will
[34:10] so all the skilled workers who were
[34:12] doing all the work on the sanctuary left
[34:14] what they were doing
[34:16] and moses said the people are bringing
[34:18] more than enough for doing the work of
[34:20] the lord commanded to be done
[34:23] then moses gave an order and they sent
[34:26] his word throughout the camp no man or
[34:28] woman is to make anything else as an
[34:31] offering for the sanctuary and so the
[34:33] people were restrained from being from
[34:36] bringing more because they were they
[34:38] already had was more than enough to do
[34:41] all the work
[34:43] we serve the same god
[34:45] so if we get behind this
[34:47] as a family and push into this vision
[34:50] it's going to require some sacrifice but
[34:52] i don't we don't want to overburden the
[34:54] church i can't emphasize that enough
[34:57] it will require some sacrifice
[34:59] of time
[35:00] a little bit of your finances probably
[35:03] but
[35:04] if we're going to move forward for our
[35:06] for our for ourselves for our church for
[35:09] our young for our young people our young
[35:11] adults our young children
[35:13] to make to give them a future should the
[35:16] lord tarry
[35:17] this is what we got to do
[35:19] and just look at what god did for them
[35:21] because they caught the vision
[35:23] god takes a little and turns it into a
[35:25] lot
[35:27] amen
[35:31] so there's something for everyone to do
[35:33] because we're a body
[35:35] and time is always the hardest thing to
[35:38] give because of the the
[35:40] you know it's easy to throw 5 10 20 into
[35:43] the basket so you know for most people
[35:46] but
[35:47] time and that's what we need mostly
[35:49] saints is your time so that we can we
[35:52] can pull together as a team
[35:54] to do these fundraisers that we're
[35:56] getting ready to talk about
[36:00] okay taking ownership of the vision
[36:04] so the first most important thing is
[36:05] pray for god's will to be done for the
[36:07] building fund
[36:09] and the construction project
[36:13] have a willing heart to help
[36:15] that's a must
[36:18] donating items time and energy and
[36:21] you'll understand that donating items
[36:24] a little more as we move into this
[36:28] financial support of course
[36:30] you know
[36:31] there's there's there's three types of
[36:33] of people for that that give
[36:36] there's those that usually will give
[36:37] like one lump sum
[36:39] for their giving there's another group
[36:42] that gives like a smaller amount but
[36:44] it's constant it's in every every month
[36:47] or every week they're giving the same
[36:49] amount
[36:50] and then there's the other ones who give
[36:52] sporadically because they love brother
[36:54] jason
[36:59] and then here so we're going to talk
[37:01] about pledging a regular amount monthly
[37:04] towards the building fund
[37:06] so what that is is what we're going to
[37:08] ask is for you to set aside a specific
[37:11] amount whatever you can afford above
[37:13] over and above your tithe and your
[37:15] offerings that you're already giving if
[37:17] you're already giving
[37:19] money to
[37:20] you know say the the missions field or
[37:24] for offer general offering for the
[37:26] building that we have right now or for
[37:27] the youth group whatever you're giving
[37:29] towards we don't want to quit giving
[37:32] to them we have to be happy givers
[37:34] but we don't want to rob peter to pay
[37:36] paul
[37:37] because that that just doesn't that
[37:39] doesn't
[37:41] help us to reach our goal
[37:43] anything additional that you would give
[37:46] has to be identified as building funder
[37:49] it won't go to that
[37:50] and
[37:51] even if it's only five dollars a month
[37:54] a little is a lot with god behind it
[37:57] so if you can't i don't understand
[37:58] everybody is living under us you know a
[38:00] tight budget right now with the price of
[38:02] everything going up but you know what if
[38:04] this is god's will that brother jason if
[38:07] god
[38:07] and brother jason are communing
[38:10] and then brother jason's sharing what
[38:11] god is communing with him god will make
[38:14] this happen
[38:16] we all we got to do is do our part and
[38:18] if all we can afford god knows our heart
[38:20] if all we can afford is five dollars a
[38:22] month god can turn that five dollars a
[38:24] month into a hundred dollars a month
[38:28] so
[38:32] enjoy your ownership of the vision i
[38:34] want everyone to to be uh enjoy what
[38:36] we're doing and what we're getting ready
[38:38] to move into i don't want it to be like
[38:41] a duty
[38:43] so participate in the fundraising teams
[38:47] encourage one another to
[38:50] actively take ownership of the vision if
[38:52] there's someone that maybe isn't getting
[38:54] involved then i need you know we all
[38:56] need to you know encourage one another
[38:58] hey come on let's do this
[39:02] get out of your comfort zone there's
[39:04] going to be a list of different types of
[39:06] fundraisers that i've come up with
[39:09] but in some of them you may not feel
[39:11] like oh i don't want to do any of those
[39:13] well
[39:14] you got to get out of your comfort zone
[39:18] and then if you have ideas outside of
[39:20] the ones that i present please share
[39:22] them because i'm you know i'm just part
[39:24] of this i'm not all of this
[39:26] everyone needs to work we're a family
[39:30] so here's some of the building fund
[39:32] drives so pop-up stores because impulse
[39:36] purchases are huge
[39:37] so what we were talking about brother
[39:39] jason and i and brother matt were
[39:41] talking about was like you know doing
[39:43] finds i just put a couple ideas up here
[39:46] bake sales t-shirts such stuff like that
[39:48] and we set up little pop-up stores out
[39:50] in front of stores i know many of you
[39:52] have seen this
[39:54] so maybe the sisters and the children
[39:56] and even men that like to bake
[39:58] and can bake i can't
[40:01] want to get together and make a bunch of
[40:04] food items i told brother jason we could
[40:06] set up pop-up stores right outside urban
[40:08] brew urban nest and i'm sure there's
[40:10] other small businesses in the community
[40:12] that would allow us to do that
[40:14] you know if we could make a hundred or
[40:16] you know 50 or 100 or 200 from each
[40:19] stand on a weekend that'd be great so
[40:22] but we need bodies to do that we need
[40:24] willing people willing to buy you know
[40:27] take you from which and maybe you can't
[40:28] give cash to the offering but maybe
[40:30] you're what you're giving is you're
[40:32] putting twenty dollars towards baking
[40:34] items so that the church can sell them
[40:37] and then the profits go towards the
[40:38] building fund
[40:39] and those are just a couple ideas so if
[40:41] you've got other ideas for pop-up stands
[40:44] just talk to us
[40:46] so a yard sale when we lived in ohio
[40:48] this was one of our biggest things that
[40:50] we did and they had a thing called
[40:52] sylvania junk days
[40:54] it was like a really rich neighborhood
[40:55] like hilton head would be and every
[40:58] every month during sylvania junk days
[41:01] they would set
[41:02] their junk which was like brand new
[41:04] stuff out to the road like exercise
[41:07] equipment all kinds of nice stuff
[41:09] in our church we would get four or five
[41:11] pickup trucks with trailers and we would
[41:13] drive around through the neighborhood
[41:15] and load stuff into our trailers and our
[41:16] trucks and we would store them and then
[41:18] we would have a great big yard sale
[41:21] literally we made i don't even remember
[41:23] the thousands amounts of thousands of
[41:25] dollars two three thousand dollars from
[41:27] one event that we did with that
[41:30] so there's things like that that we can
[41:31] do maybe there's not neighbor
[41:33] neighborhoods that we can do like that
[41:35] but we can go to thrift stores we can do
[41:37] different things a lot of our sisters
[41:39] are thrifty instead of buying it for
[41:40] yourself if you see it's it's worth it
[41:43] if it's a good item buy it purchase it
[41:47] bring it bring it and then we we can do
[41:49] a yard sale we can do
[41:52] facebook marketplace was another big one
[41:55] we could we could create a page for the
[41:57] church where we brought and we set up a
[41:59] facebook market uh marketplace and if
[42:01] you like if sister rachel purchased
[42:03] something or any of you purchased
[42:04] something
[42:06] we'll post it on the facebook
[42:07] marketplace but they would pick up at
[42:09] sister h's house so that we don't have a
[42:12] pla we don't have to rent a space to
[42:14] keep everything if that makes sense
[42:18] and these could that would also be for
[42:19] our donated items that we have so
[42:22] instead of us having a garage sale of
[42:24] our own stuff which we accumulate so
[42:26] much stuff we just donate it for the
[42:29] yard sale or for the facebook
[42:31] marketplace
[42:33] a candle sale this is an idea
[42:35] that i got because
[42:37] we make we get these
[42:38] locally made candles that we sell at
[42:40] urban brew and we could make up some
[42:43] sheets and send the people out who want
[42:45] to do it to you know you can either take
[42:47] them with you to work to fill out or
[42:49] school
[42:50] you can take them people can canvas
[42:52] areas of the neighborhood and and sell
[42:55] these candles i told brother jason i'll
[42:58] purchase the candles for through urban
[43:00] brew and then we can you know we can
[43:03] we'll give all the profits to the church
[43:05] you the church will just buy you know
[43:07] pay me back for the the purchase of the
[43:10] candle and whatever we can make on them
[43:12] we can make about 50
[43:14] profit on those candles
[43:16] so that's just an idea i know in the
[43:18] past when i was with the youth we did
[43:21] car washes a few times more than a few
[43:23] times to raise money for different
[43:25] things we wanted to do with the youth so
[43:27] car washes dog washes for people that
[43:30] like animals if you want to set up dog
[43:32] wash stations
[43:34] here's one a portrait fundraiser we got
[43:37] a few photographers in the church so
[43:40] basically what we do is we
[43:42] we we sell chits to people for ten
[43:45] dollars or whatever that cost would be
[43:47] they go they needed a nice place that
[43:49] we've just we've picked out here in
[43:51] beaufort
[43:52] we take some pictures of them and they
[43:54] for that ten dollars they get one
[43:56] portrait but if they want to buy a
[43:58] package
[44:00] we can sell them a package and then we
[44:02] just we take whatever the cost is and we
[44:04] add a few dollars to it and then
[44:06] whatever the profit is so if we got
[44:08] three photographers or more out there if
[44:11] we're doing this and we get a lot of
[44:12] families that could
[44:14] equate to a lot of money
[44:17] this is one we were talking about
[44:18] yesterday a five or a 10k run um travis
[44:22] and deborah are going to help with that
[44:23] one because they're the the runners in
[44:25] the church
[44:27] um this is something that we could be
[44:29] huge it could be really huge
[44:32] for anybody that's
[44:33] been you know did any of that running if
[44:36] you want to be involved with that just
[44:37] let travis and deb or me know
[44:41] here's something my wife thought of
[44:43] we were actually brainstorming ideas
[44:46] for urban brew to make more money and
[44:49] then when this all came into light of
[44:51] what church was going to do i just said
[44:53] babe what if we just
[44:54] took this and did this for the church
[44:56] instead of for us
[44:58] and she's like you know awesome idea i
[45:00] was thinking the same thing so what this
[45:03] is is a mother-daughter tea we set up
[45:05] urban brew we close it down on a sunday
[45:07] we always close on sundays we and we
[45:10] sell tickets for mother daughters of any
[45:12] age they come in they have like snacks
[45:15] and tea and rachel likes to go to these
[45:18] i've heard so maybe she could help with
[45:19] that
[45:20] and um
[45:22] and you know decorate it nice place nice
[45:24] music and we even talked about maybe
[45:26] bringing in a special speaker of some
[45:28] sort that could minister to mothers and
[45:31] daughters in some way
[45:33] you know form uh fashion
[45:36] that's just another idea i think would
[45:38] be a really
[45:39] a really and if it works and it goes
[45:41] over well we could do that time and time
[45:43] again
[45:45] here's one so the men don't feel left
[45:47] out and we don't really drink tea so we
[45:50] we like fraps
[45:52] so we can do a father-son frap and do
[45:54] something similar
[45:56] and coffee bean sale this is something
[45:59] that i'm kind of working on the backside
[46:01] for urban brew in urban nest
[46:04] purchasing a real large shipment of
[46:06] beans
[46:08] that i could never get rid of on my own
[46:10] and when i purchase them the church can
[46:12] buy some from me as a you know at cost
[46:16] or whatever and then whatever they sell
[46:17] them for
[46:19] same thing as the candles you can go
[46:21] door-to-door we can set up stands
[46:23] whatever it is and uh whatever profit is
[46:26] made the church can we'll split it with
[46:28] the church
[46:31] maybe a concert that be another idea
[46:34] we got so many gifts here why not use
[46:36] them
[46:39] how about put music on spotify i don't
[46:42] know how spotify works but maybe brother
[46:44] matt does i know that the lafontaine's
[46:46] put some music on spotify that could be
[46:48] something we could look into
[46:51] and then if you have any other ideas
[46:52] text me or call me with your ideas of
[46:55] brother jason brother matt not jason
[46:57] probably he's too busy but brother matt
[46:59] and i'll
[47:00] be pretty much heading this up
[47:04] i'm really excited about this vision
[47:06] saints and uh i hope all of you over the
[47:09] coming days and weeks will be in prayer
[47:11] of what god wants to
[47:13] how god wants to use you
[47:17] and then yield to that
[47:20] you know i guess
[47:26] the hardest part about putting all this
[47:27] together was is that i know the finance
[47:30] the financial times are tough but i just
[47:33] want to re-emphasize that
[47:35] we're not asking you to
[47:37] you know to
[47:39] put yourself in dire straits but it's
[47:41] more about giving of your time than your
[47:43] finances
[47:45] and but back to the pledges for those of
[47:48] you that are interested in doing uh a
[47:50] pledge which would mean you know once a
[47:52] month or whatever you're going to cut
[47:54] the church a check that's separate
[47:57] if that's something you're interested in
[47:59] after praying about it
[48:01] i think the best way to handle that
[48:03] would be for you to text brother jason
[48:05] individually
[48:07] privately
[48:08] an amount that you feel like you can
[48:11] you know without hurting yourself or
[48:13] your family or taking from your family
[48:15] an amount that you think you can do is a
[48:17] pledge and they don't have to be no one
[48:20] else is going to know who's involved in
[48:22] it you're just going to send that to
[48:23] brother jason and then it's between you
[48:25] brother jason and the lord what you if
[48:28] you follow through with that or not
[48:30] but if you make that pledge reminds you
[48:32] i want to remind you that you it's we're
[48:34] going to be counting on that
[48:36] so if you can't make a pledge and you'd
[48:37] rather just give individually as you can
[48:40] then that's fine too but for those of
[48:42] you that feel led to want to pledge five
[48:45] dollars a month 10.20 you know whatever
[48:48] it is how many of us go out to eat at
[48:50] least once a week you know if we go to
[48:52] every other week and we give that toward
[48:54] the vision brother jason has been given
[48:56] by the lord then
[48:58] you know i believe god will bless you
[49:00] and eventually you'll get that week back
[49:03] so i just want to say thank you i've
[49:05] taken enough time way too much time
[49:08] i apologize for that
[49:10] so god bless you

[1:18:04] fear gripped their hearts
[1:18:07] they thought they
[1:18:09] would die
[1:18:10] but they failed to remember
[1:18:14] that the master was not
[1:18:17] he spoke
[1:18:21] and the winds all stood still

[1:18:26] [Music]

[1:18:50] when this very same jesus he is always
[1:18:55] so near
[1:18:57] he lives in my heart

[1:19:17] how he walked with him
[1:19:20] brought light to the
[1:19:22] darkness when the way grew so dim
[1:19:26] how great it would be
[1:19:29] to have his footsteps in mind to walk
[1:19:34] with the master
[1:19:36] all of the time
[1:19:39] and when trials come
[1:19:43] and death seems so
[1:19:45] nice i'll call on the master
[1:19:49] i know he'll get there on time
[1:19:53] and when sickness comes and my body's in
[1:19:58] pain
[1:20:00] all i have to do
[1:20:03] call on his name
[1:20:06] so why should i worry
[1:20:09] why should i fear
[1:20:12] when the spirits think jesus is always
[1:20:17] so near he lives in my heart
[1:20:22] he hears me when i cry

[1:26:31] but brother kenny covered
[1:26:33] everything so thoroughly

[1:26:45] time i want you to do a thorough
[1:26:47] job because that was you never get a

[1:26:52] so we wanted to really lay out our
[1:26:54] vision there and i sure appreciate
[1:26:56] brother ken doing that and so i just
[1:26:57] want you to know
[1:26:59] and i let brother anthony know sing
[1:27:01] worship the lord amen uh
[1:27:04] we've got some baptisms at the end of
[1:27:06] the service today so i'll regulate my
[1:27:08] side of it amen the lord will help me
[1:27:11] amen i don't ever consider myself
[1:27:13] long-winded at any rate but uh we'll
[1:27:16] abbreviate just a little bit today but i
[1:27:18] have a definite burden i know you're
[1:27:19] lovers of the word
[1:27:21] amen so we want to look into the word of
[1:27:24] god revelation chapter 1
[1:27:26] and we're going to read verses 9 through
[1:27:29] 20. now what i will do is as i will
[1:27:32] we'll read verse 9 and 10 and then we'll
[1:27:35] let you be seated and then we'll keep
[1:27:37] keep reading from there
[1:27:41] so revelation chapter 1 verse 9. i
[1:27:44] john who also am your brother and
[1:27:47] companion in tribulation
[1:27:50] and in the kingdom and patience of jesus
[1:27:52] christ
[1:27:54] was in the isle that is called patmos
[1:27:56] for the word of god and for the
[1:27:59] testimony of jesus christ
[1:28:02] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[1:28:05] and heard behind me a great voice
[1:28:08] as of a trumpet amen father we thank you
[1:28:12] for your word today now i just committed
[1:28:14] and give it into your hands completely
[1:28:17] instruct us lord
[1:28:19] with what we have need of for today we
[1:28:21] commit it to you in jesus name amen god
[1:28:24] bless your friends you can be seated
[1:28:38] so
[1:28:39] i was in the spirit
[1:28:41] on the lord's day
[1:28:42] and heard behind me a voice says of a
[1:28:45] trumpet you know brother branham makes
[1:28:48] comments when he's doing his study on
[1:28:51] these chapters in the book of revelation
[1:28:54] and brother branham picks up this this
[1:28:56] idea of being in the spirit and it is it
[1:28:59] is so important to do that because
[1:29:01] brother branham actually would say
[1:29:03] before you do anything before you pray
[1:29:06] before you do anything
[1:29:08] get in the spirit so i when i read that
[1:29:12] from a prophet saying that before you do
[1:29:15] anything get in the spirit then that
[1:29:18] tells me that it is based upon uh you
[1:29:21] living in a in a higher realm higher
[1:29:24] than this natural realm that that's
[1:29:26] where the word of god is going to flow
[1:29:29] to you the best and god's going to be
[1:29:30] able to get behind your life and how
[1:29:32] many wanting behind your life amen i
[1:29:34] want god to be able to uh to verify and
[1:29:38] to vindicate that my direction is is
[1:29:41] correct that my attitudes are correct
[1:29:43] that my thinking is correct because this
[1:29:46] is a day of messed up thinking
[1:29:49] this is a day of
[1:29:50] you know perplexing and and the bible
[1:29:53] talks about perilous time and men's
[1:29:55] hearts failing for fear and mankind
[1:29:58] losing the ability to turn between right
[1:30:00] and wrong and he's heady and he's
[1:30:01] high-minded i'm going to tell you
[1:30:03] something friends if we ever needed the
[1:30:05] mind of christ to be functional
[1:30:07] in our lives this is the hour and i'm
[1:30:10] here to tell you that
[1:30:12] the holy spirit is the most functional
[1:30:15] uh being in existence but but but when
[1:30:18] he's working through you and i the
[1:30:21] problem is not in the holy spirit the
[1:30:23] logjam's not in the holy ghost the
[1:30:25] logjam sometimes is in us
[1:30:27] and our minds and our hearts and our
[1:30:29] attitudes uh it can be in complex as it
[1:30:33] can be it can be just somebody cuts you
[1:30:35] off in traffic
[1:30:38] and you haven't learned how to control
[1:30:40] your spirit to not grieve the holy ghost
[1:30:43] because i'm here to tell you something
[1:30:44] friends in this hour that we live in i
[1:30:47] don't think we should be out operating
[1:30:50] at any moment without the anointing of
[1:30:52] the holy spirit upon us
[1:30:54] leading us and guiding us i'm speaking
[1:30:56] to you today on the life
[1:30:59] in the word
[1:31:00] and i heard behind me a great voice
[1:31:04] as of a trumpet now
[1:31:06] we're not going to turn to it i want
[1:31:07] them to keep that on the screen right
[1:31:09] there but in numbers chapter 10 verse 2
[1:31:12] they were commanded make thee two
[1:31:14] trumpets of silver of course silver
[1:31:16] represents redemption
[1:31:17] make thee two trumpets of silver of a
[1:31:20] whole peace
[1:31:22] shout thou make them so the silver the
[1:31:25] redemption is made of of one thing
[1:31:29] both of them are made from one thing and
[1:31:32] that is the grace of god and he says
[1:31:35] that thou mayest use them for the
[1:31:38] calling of the assembly
[1:31:40] and for the journeying
[1:31:43] of the camps now we find that we have
[1:31:47] two trumpets here and of course we can
[1:31:49] we're not
[1:31:50] trying to do this as a bible study today
[1:31:53] we can correlate that because you have
[1:31:55] the trumpet
[1:31:56] of israel that is used to gather them
[1:31:58] but you also have and here's something
[1:32:00] the prophet pointed out that we have
[1:32:02] what we would call the gospel trumpet
[1:32:05] and it's a gospel trumpet in the ages
[1:32:07] and that's what john is hearing i heard
[1:32:09] behind me a voice sounded like a trumpet
[1:32:11] see and so there's a gospel trumpet in
[1:32:14] the ages that we hear
[1:32:16] during the preaching of the word in each
[1:32:19] age and so two trumpets made from one
[1:32:23] piece of redemption it's all the grace
[1:32:26] of god now let's i just wanted to drop
[1:32:29] that point in i'm going to move on verse
[1:32:31] 11
[1:32:33] saying i'm alpha omega the first and the
[1:32:35] last what thou seest write in a book and
[1:32:37] send it unto the seven churches which
[1:32:39] are in asia and ephesus and smyrna and
[1:32:41] pergamus thy tyrus sardis philadelphia
[1:32:44] and laocia verse 12 and i turned to see
[1:32:46] the voice that spake with me and being
[1:32:49] turned i saw seven golden candlesticks
[1:32:51] and in the midst of the seven
[1:32:53] candlesticks one likened to the son of
[1:32:55] man clothed with the garment down to the
[1:32:57] foot and gird about the pabst with the
[1:32:58] golden girl now here is your first in
[1:33:01] the very first chapter you're going to
[1:33:02] see it again in chapter 10 you're going
[1:33:04] to see christ and the imagery of the
[1:33:07] scripture is christ in his body in the
[1:33:10] church that's why brother branham would
[1:33:12] say gird about the paps like a woman
[1:33:14] would be and so we find that it's christ
[1:33:17] absolutely that's who john saw one like
[1:33:20] the son of man and brother branham's and
[1:33:22] brother branham is showing us that the
[1:33:24] bible imagery is christ in his church
[1:33:27] because christ is
[1:33:29] his body lays on the mercy seat the
[1:33:31] blood making a perpetual atonement or
[1:33:33] just reading it this morning fresh house
[1:33:35] brother branham said that you know
[1:33:37] sometimes we we get in life and we have
[1:33:39] different struggles and sometimes we
[1:33:41] find ourselves in weakness
[1:33:44] sometimes we stumble yeah amen sometimes
[1:33:47] we struggle uh to to keep our our life
[1:33:50] in the past of righteousness does it
[1:33:52] brother branham said sometimes you'll do
[1:33:54] wrong said you'll you'll it doesn't mean
[1:33:56] you're not a son it just means a lot of
[1:33:58] corrections on the way to which i say
[1:34:01] praise god
[1:34:02] hallelujah whatever lord by whatever
[1:34:05] means necessary i want to make sure that
[1:34:08] my life is a testament to your life
[1:34:12] and so brother branham was saying you
[1:34:13] know sometimes we do we make those
[1:34:15] mistakes and i probably should pull it
[1:34:17] up to not butcher it but but it just
[1:34:19] moved me because brother branham said
[1:34:21] just remember that he's a faithful high
[1:34:23] priest he knows what you're going
[1:34:25] through he knows sometimes temptations
[1:34:28] can get so strong you almost can't stand
[1:34:30] it he knows what the sin of the world he
[1:34:33] knows the
[1:34:34] influence of the devil and he said
[1:34:35] that's why he said he sits there at the
[1:34:38] right hand of the father to intercede on
[1:34:40] behalf of his family down in the earth i
[1:34:43] just said blessed be the name of the
[1:34:45] lord
[1:34:48] and so he
[1:34:50] he we see this imagery you see it again
[1:34:52] in revelation 10 1 so much imagery there
[1:34:54] in bible imagery that it's that it's
[1:34:56] christ is fetus pillars of fire and
[1:34:59] rainbow around around his head and oh my
[1:35:02] so much so much so we don't want to get
[1:35:04] sidetracked into that today but but that
[1:35:06] is as brother branham to use brother
[1:35:08] branham's words a bright coming of
[1:35:10] christ see remember the nail scarred man
[1:35:13] the earth doesn't see until revelation
[1:35:15] 19.
[1:35:16] that's the one they're looking for but
[1:35:18] they will never see that version before
[1:35:21] the rapture the only version of jesus
[1:35:24] christ the earth sees before the rapture
[1:35:27] is in his bride body
[1:35:30] see they see the nail scarred man in
[1:35:32] chapter 19 and they're wailing and and
[1:35:34] it's not a happy moment for them uh but
[1:35:37] it's it's a glorious thing for us isn't
[1:35:39] it
[1:35:40] so he goes on he says he describes in
[1:35:42] verse
[1:35:43] uh
[1:35:44] well let's skip down to
[1:35:46] verse 17 and when i saw him i fell at
[1:35:49] his feet as dead verse 17 and he laid
[1:35:52] his right hand upon me saying unto me
[1:35:54] fear not
[1:35:55] i am the first and the last i am he that
[1:35:57] liveth and was dead and behold i am
[1:35:59] alive forevermore amen
[1:36:01] and have the keys of hell and the great
[1:36:04] hell and of death
[1:36:06] write the things which thou has seen
[1:36:09] and the things excuse me which are and
[1:36:12] the things which shall be hereafter and
[1:36:14] he goes on to describe the mystery of
[1:36:16] the stars and the and the and the and
[1:36:19] the golden candlesticks as being the age
[1:36:21] of the churches and the messengers to
[1:36:23] those churches you know
[1:36:25] i was commenting last night uh how many
[1:36:28] are still just living off of wednesday
[1:36:31] night my what a move of the holy spirit
[1:36:34] what a word that came forth to challenge
[1:36:37] us and and lift us i'm here to tell you
[1:36:39] something friends the word of god is the
[1:36:41] only form of magic
[1:36:43] that whole stuff with harry potter
[1:36:45] that's nonsense that's demon demonic
[1:36:47] stuff i'm here to tell you there is a
[1:36:49] magic and it's the power of god and it
[1:36:52] is so powerful it can take human mortals
[1:36:55] and lift you into an immortal realm it
[1:36:57] can take people who who come from all
[1:36:59] walks of life and and brother branham
[1:37:02] talks about how that you travel you go
[1:37:04] somewhere in prayer there's a value in
[1:37:07] pressing into the spirit of god
[1:37:11] and it takes the word as as the word
[1:37:15] so much
[1:37:16] talks about in the bible out of the word
[1:37:18] he sent forth his word and healed the
[1:37:20] people
[1:37:21] so you're you should have no conflict
[1:37:25] with me
[1:37:26] if i should say to you
[1:37:29] there's nothing greater for you
[1:37:31] there's nothing greater i could give you
[1:37:32] than the word of god
[1:37:35] there's no possession you could have
[1:37:37] greater than a
[1:37:39] word of god not just a head knowledge
[1:37:42] not just an accumulation of knowledge
[1:37:44] but a living word and that means it's an
[1:37:47] anointed word that means it's a bleeding
[1:37:49] word that means it's spirit jesus said
[1:37:51] my words are spirit and life
[1:37:56] so we we we were rejoicing at the word
[1:37:59] that he sent his word and healed the
[1:38:01] people he we're washed clean
[1:38:04] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:38:08] the bible says that the word of god is
[1:38:11] health to all your flesh
[1:38:15] i mean that's everything that's your
[1:38:17] that's that's your that's this flesh
[1:38:19] that's your spirit man i'm here to tell
[1:38:21] you if you need your imagination healed
[1:38:23] today if you need your memories healed
[1:38:24] if you need your affections healed there
[1:38:26] is a word here that can bring healing
[1:38:29] inside your physical body and in your
[1:38:31] mind
[1:38:33] thank god he hasn't left us thank god we
[1:38:36] could have a preacher come up here and
[1:38:38] begin to preach and begin to labor and
[1:38:40] begin to push and demons start losing
[1:38:42] their grip and they start heading toward
[1:38:44] the back door and by the time the
[1:38:46] preacher's anointed demons are out in
[1:38:48] the street saying what happened what
[1:38:49] happened and the people in here are
[1:38:51] rejoicing under the power of god that's
[1:38:54] value beyond value
[1:38:56] there is no greater value that it
[1:38:59] wouldn't matter what kind of church we
[1:39:00] build or renovate or remodel or buy in
[1:39:02] the future whatever we need to do i'm
[1:39:04] here to tell you i want a place where
[1:39:06] the power of god moves and the people
[1:39:09] have an expectation
[1:39:12] that he lives
[1:39:17] much deeper than emotion
[1:39:20] it's much further than that
[1:39:22] it's a living reality that it's not
[1:39:25] natural
[1:39:27] it's super
[1:39:28] natural
[1:39:30] you understand that
[1:39:32] i mean as as a natural man born in sin
[1:39:36] your mind is enmity against god he could
[1:39:37] never agree with his word so it it
[1:39:39] literally
[1:39:41] takes the holy spirit
[1:39:43] to reveal himself to you
[1:39:46] and and i i remember commenting to
[1:39:48] brother brad in the
[1:39:49] back i said you know this is
[1:39:52] we look in prophecy as brother matt was
[1:39:54] doing such an excellent job today
[1:39:57] that what i don't know what his title
[1:39:59] was but i can tell you what you were
[1:40:00] hearing you're hearing modern events
[1:40:02] made clear in prophecy
[1:40:05] and we're not talking about modern
[1:40:06] events in the 60s but i believe that
[1:40:08] modern events is a sermon that has to be
[1:40:10] preached periodically i mean that that's
[1:40:12] exactly what they were that's what the
[1:40:14] prophet when when here you got one
[1:40:16] prophet saying we'll be in there 70
[1:40:18] years in captivity here's another one
[1:40:20] saying oh it's only two years but the
[1:40:22] true prophet of god went back to the
[1:40:24] word and interpreted that day's modern
[1:40:26] event by the prophecy
[1:40:29] said listen there's been prophets before
[1:40:30] us and they didn't prophesy there's no
[1:40:33] nothing in their prophecies to make you
[1:40:35] think that we're just going to get a
[1:40:36] two-year slap on the wrist that it's
[1:40:39] going to be 70 years because we have
[1:40:41] sinned and forsaken god and and and the
[1:40:43] prophecies of elijah do not portend
[1:40:46] happiness for us
[1:40:49] and so that was a modern event that's
[1:40:50] why brother brandon when he comes along
[1:40:51] modern events made clear
[1:40:54] in prophecy i'm going to tell you
[1:40:55] something friends we can't emphasize it
[1:40:57] enough that you see i remember i
[1:41:00] remember years ago a minister testifying
[1:41:03] how the lord moved on him that every
[1:41:05] time a seal was opened and a living
[1:41:08] creature said come and see and the holy
[1:41:10] spirit spoke to him said how can my
[1:41:12] people know me if they can't see me i'll
[1:41:15] tell you brothers you ministering
[1:41:17] brothers here it is incumbent upon us to
[1:41:20] lay in the presence of god and get the
[1:41:22] fresh kill of the word and bring it to
[1:41:24] the people because god's family will
[1:41:27] believe it and eagles will feed on it
[1:41:32] and we were just commenting on that this
[1:41:34] is the age we have reached an age here's
[1:41:37] a modern event made clear in prophecy
[1:41:39] not merely what's happening in china or
[1:41:41] north korea or ukraine or europe or the
[1:41:44] vatican
[1:41:45] those things are are moving at the at
[1:41:47] the at the pace of prophecy i was i was
[1:41:49] saying that yesterday in the men's
[1:41:50] breakfast and i've been preaching on it
[1:41:53] that that god moves at the speed of
[1:41:55] prophecy
[1:41:57] brother i'm talks about him
[1:41:58] stopping time speeding up time we've
[1:42:00] we've ministered on it here many times i
[1:42:02] don't need to go into it again today but
[1:42:04] he moves at the speed of prophecy he
[1:42:05] doesn't move by this
[1:42:07] he makes this obey this
[1:42:10] we've talked about that before so so we
[1:42:12] find that that we've reached an age
[1:42:15] where it is an age of total victory i
[1:42:17] want i want to encourage you today
[1:42:19] you're living in the day where the bride
[1:42:20] of christ comes to perfect faith where
[1:42:23] she comes to total victory where she
[1:42:24] comes to total deliverance where we're
[1:42:26] coming to that perfect image of god and
[1:42:29] why should we not have liberty why
[1:42:32] should we not have freedom in the spirit
[1:42:34] why should we not have overcoming power
[1:42:36] i say we should and that's what i want
[1:42:39] and that's the whole desire of my life
[1:42:44] the world is is much
[1:42:46] is far too challenging
[1:42:49] the the the things that's going on in
[1:42:51] the world today you hear me friends it's
[1:42:53] much too challenging
[1:42:55] to not
[1:42:57] operate in the spirit
[1:43:00] i mean you know this gospel that we
[1:43:02] preach alone we were
[1:43:04] talking about this yesterday in our
[1:43:05] fundraising ideas and how that we'll
[1:43:08] even have to really observe the
[1:43:09] scripture to be
[1:43:10] wise as serpents and yet harmless as
[1:43:13] doves
[1:43:14] because if there's one thing
[1:43:18] that's sure
[1:43:19] about the word of any age
[1:43:23] it is not pc sensitive to the age
[1:43:27] it doesn't care at all about political
[1:43:29] correctness
[1:43:30] it's not bothered by it's not afraid of
[1:43:32] cancer culture
[1:43:34] the word of god has always been straight
[1:43:36] and just comes forth and i mean why
[1:43:39] shouldn't it because it comes from god
[1:43:42] and god isn't subject to man to man's
[1:43:44] opinions
[1:43:45] and neither should he be i don't want a
[1:43:47] god who can be swayed by the popular
[1:43:49] opinion of mankind across the earth i
[1:43:51] wanted god to tell me the truth
[1:43:54] hallelujah friends i'm i'm not here to i
[1:43:56] get using wisdom i get that believe me i
[1:43:59] get using wisdom the bible talks about
[1:44:01] that that a lot of times a lack of
[1:44:04] wisdom you cut yourself off from being
[1:44:06] able to help the person at all and it's
[1:44:07] not even their fault it's your fault
[1:44:09] and so there is a certain amount of
[1:44:11] wisdom and and and you know i brother
[1:44:13] matt was giving me a testimony the other
[1:44:15] day of the of the gentleman him and
[1:44:17] brother travis went to see
[1:44:20] matt said he said i'm going to tell you
[1:44:22] something
[1:44:22] if you're going to go to war you're
[1:44:24] going to want travis jackson with you
[1:44:26] amen
[1:44:28] he said that brother is fearless
[1:44:30] amen he said he doesn't you know he's
[1:44:32] not even doesn't care who's around he's
[1:44:34] going to tell what god did for him i'm
[1:44:36] going to tell you why because it's real
[1:44:39] and it matters and i like telling you
[1:44:42] what god has done in my life i like
[1:44:45] bragging on the power of god i like
[1:44:47] promising you things that he has
[1:44:48] promised in his word and i want to
[1:44:50] encourage you to believe them
[1:44:54] there is no power like the word of god
[1:44:56] when it's anointed by the spirit of god
[1:44:58] see
[1:45:00] otherwise it can be just a dead letter
[1:45:03] which is just an accumulation of
[1:45:05] knowledge and the world
[1:45:07] impales themselves
[1:45:08] uh in in the pursuit
[1:45:10] of just knowledge the accumulation of
[1:45:12] knowledge they study the bible just to
[1:45:14] accumulate knowledge my goodness friends
[1:45:17] you you
[1:45:18] which what's more important to know the
[1:45:21] content or to know the author to know
[1:45:23] this book or to know the author of the
[1:45:24] book
[1:45:25] amen
[1:45:26] and so so we find that that the bible
[1:45:30] testifies that that knowing god is far
[1:45:32] more important even than knowing the
[1:45:33] bible itself
[1:45:35] and so we find so many so many
[1:45:38] uh situations where
[1:45:41] preaching the word of god
[1:45:43] the way it was intended to be preached
[1:45:46] can become very politically unco
[1:45:48] incorrect
[1:45:50] it can it can make it can cause you to
[1:45:53] be ostracized by even your blood family
[1:45:56] it can cause you to to be set aside it
[1:45:59] can cause you to miss career
[1:46:01] opportunities
[1:46:03] it can cause your it can cause your
[1:46:06] financial outcome to be less than if you
[1:46:09] went the way of the world that's why
[1:46:11] brother branham said if you want to be
[1:46:12] successful if you want to be in you know
[1:46:15] the business success and and or maybe he
[1:46:17] said you want to be a lady killer and
[1:46:19] you want to do all these things he said
[1:46:21] you better you better forsake this
[1:46:23] because this will destroy you if you're
[1:46:25] if that's your goal this will this will
[1:46:26] wipe you out you'll never be you'll
[1:46:28] never achieve those those
[1:46:29] accomplishments but i say i don't want
[1:46:32] those things i want this life because i
[1:46:34] know those things are going to pass away
[1:46:35] this will never pass away
[1:46:38] and the fruit of this will live on and
[1:46:40] on and on and i'm here to tell you when
[1:46:42] all the billionaire and zillionaires and
[1:46:44] and when they're all gone and the world
[1:46:47] is on fire i want to be at home in
[1:46:49] christ
[1:46:50] i want to know that my life mattered and
[1:46:53] it's continuing to matter
[1:46:58] jesus said in saint john 6
[1:47:02] oh give me that uh brother josh saint
[1:47:04] john 6
[1:47:05] 53 to let's just i'm not going to read
[1:47:08] it all but
[1:47:09] he says in saint john 6 53
[1:47:12] he talking about something that's
[1:47:14] politically incorrect jesus said unto
[1:47:17] them
[1:47:18] verily verily i say unto you
[1:47:21] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[1:47:23] man and drink his blood you have no life
[1:47:25] in you
[1:47:28] so you know i think that i could
[1:47:30] that i could persuade you today
[1:47:33] that if you're going to if you're really
[1:47:35] going to get life if you're going to
[1:47:37] choose life now you don't have to
[1:47:40] but if you're going to choose life
[1:47:42] then pretty much you're going to have to
[1:47:45] forsake the world
[1:47:47] because the the whole world is designed
[1:47:51] and it has one function to destroy
[1:47:55] you say well that's that's an audacious
[1:47:57] statement well that's pretty negative
[1:47:58] well look all i know is is that the same
[1:48:01] one who's the god of the evil age
[1:48:04] goes about seeking whom he may devour so
[1:48:07] you tell me
[1:48:08] you tell me what the spirit behind
[1:48:11] behind the world is today he's the god
[1:48:14] of the age
[1:48:15] and he goeth about like a roaring lion
[1:48:17] seeking whom he may devour he he'll here
[1:48:19] here's here's the spirit of the age and
[1:48:21] you know what he does he he seeks to
[1:48:24] kill and destroy
[1:48:27] you see so so i don't think i'm out on a
[1:48:29] limb today to say go the way of the
[1:48:31] world and you are going the way of
[1:48:33] destruction go the way of the word and
[1:48:35] you are going toward life
[1:48:38] amen
[1:48:40] there should be no doubt in your mind
[1:48:43] see he goes on in verse 60 tells how
[1:48:46] that
[1:48:47] many therefore of his disciples when
[1:48:49] they heard this said
[1:48:51] that's a hard saying who can hear it
[1:48:54] verse 63 here's jesus response it is the
[1:48:57] spirit
[1:48:58] that quickeneth
[1:49:00] the flesh profiteth nothing
[1:49:04] i mean he didn't even say prophets
[1:49:06] little he said it prophets nothing
[1:49:09] the word
[1:49:10] the words that i speak unto you
[1:49:13] they are spirit
[1:49:14] and they are life
[1:49:16] so now he's not mincing words
[1:49:19] that
[1:49:20] that
[1:49:21] that the flesh
[1:49:23] the the way of the world it's just like
[1:49:24] in the bible where
[1:49:26] it talks about how that
[1:49:28] you you can see that the difference
[1:49:30] between
[1:49:32] isaac and ishmael
[1:49:34] and the bible records i think the king
[1:49:36] james uses the word uh flesh that our
[1:49:39] desire i think it uses the word desire
[1:49:41] that ishmael was a product of the desire
[1:49:44] of the flesh of abraham but isaac was a
[1:49:48] product of the word of the promise i
[1:49:50] think that it uses the word promise so
[1:49:53] so you've got two boys
[1:49:55] you've got two human beings in the earth
[1:49:57] and one of them is is has been
[1:50:00] manufactured by the promise in the word
[1:50:03] and the other has been manufactured at
[1:50:05] just the desire the human fleshly
[1:50:07] desires of a man who took a woman and
[1:50:10] she got pregnant and had a child
[1:50:12] and and now you just correlate that over
[1:50:14] into the spirit then why the spiritual
[1:50:17] why would you want a man made
[1:50:21] after the desires of flesh that's what
[1:50:23] denominationalism is it's just man-made
[1:50:27] why would you choose that people say oh
[1:50:29] you're you're outcast you're a little
[1:50:30] cold i say my goodness
[1:50:33] if i'm that then what are you because
[1:50:36] i'm a part of the kingdom of god
[1:50:38] so where does that leave you i'll tell
[1:50:39] you where it leaves you leaves them and
[1:50:41] leaves them on the outside looking in
[1:50:45] it is the spirit that quickeneth flesh
[1:50:47] profit is nothing
[1:50:49] the words that i speak unto you they are
[1:50:52] spirit and they are life
[1:50:56] the word of god has power in it
[1:50:59] the preached word i've
[1:51:00] i've stood you know and and it can it
[1:51:03] comes in many different ways
[1:51:05] i've we've seen people
[1:51:07] stand here in front of this
[1:51:09] altar or this platform and we've laid
[1:51:12] hands and
[1:51:13] we've prayed for them we've anointed
[1:51:14] with oil some we have some we haven't
[1:51:16] some we laid hands on some we didn't
[1:51:18] some we just made a mass prayer you know
[1:51:21] but we've seen god move
[1:51:23] we've seen god heal we've seen god
[1:51:25] liberate and restore
[1:51:27] i've seen people come to christ with the
[1:51:29] baptism of the holy ghost with with no
[1:51:32] prayer at all just preaching
[1:51:34] like the house of cornelius the bible
[1:51:36] says while peter yet spake these words
[1:51:40] the holy ghost fell on him i want to
[1:51:41] tell you something friends i've been in
[1:51:43] services where that has happened and
[1:51:45] i've had testimony come back we've made
[1:51:46] we made no altar called no prayer line
[1:51:49] prayed for no one all we did was preach
[1:51:51] the word and people believed it and
[1:51:53] people rose up to their feet delivered
[1:51:55] of complexes and fears and depression
[1:51:58] and suicide demons and young people been
[1:52:00] filled with the holy ghost and people
[1:52:02] have been healed in their bodies we've
[1:52:04] seen that happen
[1:52:06] amen it just happened recently i just
[1:52:08] got a testimony back from a brother i
[1:52:10] won't say who but he he said he had a
[1:52:13] family member
[1:52:14] uh in lima where brother diggs and i
[1:52:16] were ministering
[1:52:18] just recently with brother paul
[1:52:19] lafontaine
[1:52:20] and there was a apparently a young woman
[1:52:22] who was a family member who had been a
[1:52:24] defector from the message and had
[1:52:26] backslid which they all do as soon as
[1:52:28] they leave it they end up backsliding
[1:52:30] and and sure enough true to form she
[1:52:34] she got a critical spirit she started
[1:52:36] backsliding went into the world and she
[1:52:39] heard brother paul was running special
[1:52:40] meetings and something pricked her heart
[1:52:42] to go and she'd come in sunday morning
[1:52:45] and she heard me ministering oh you know
[1:52:48] what's it what you wanna you wanna hear
[1:52:50] something amazing i was ministering on
[1:52:52] quantum mechanics
[1:52:55] i was ministering on quantum
[1:52:56] entanglement which is which is
[1:52:58] that that's that's god's creative
[1:53:01] connectivity of that's why brother
[1:53:02] branham would say all nature runs in
[1:53:04] continuity
[1:53:05] see that's because scientists don't
[1:53:07] understand that i needed a hillbilly
[1:53:08] prophet to understand it they they have
[1:53:10] a hard time even explaining it
[1:53:12] themselves they admit that it's hard to
[1:53:13] explain it's a concept you know because
[1:53:15] it's hard to explain how you take two
[1:53:17] entangled particles and and send them in
[1:53:20] different directions hundreds of light
[1:53:21] years apart but because they're
[1:53:23] entangled they have they they keep a
[1:53:25] constant connection and when one is
[1:53:27] observed its position this one will
[1:53:29] immediately snap into that position and
[1:53:31] they'll do that and i and i was talking
[1:53:32] about the sympathy uh sympathetic
[1:53:35] resonance i've preached on it here
[1:53:36] before and how that god it doesn't
[1:53:39] matter that he's in heaven and that i'm
[1:53:40] in earth i'm in sympathy with the holy
[1:53:43] spirit and when the holy s like the
[1:53:45] wheel within the middle of the wheels
[1:53:46] and when one went forward they all went
[1:53:48] forward and when one lifted up they all
[1:53:50] lifted up and i said god moves from
[1:53:52] heaven and we move on the earth and
[1:53:55] whatever the father does that's what we
[1:53:57] do and that young woman saw that and
[1:54:00] came to her senses and repented and
[1:54:03] wrote to her family said i'm a believer
[1:54:06] hallelujah hallelujah friends at what at
[1:54:09] the preaching of the word of god
[1:54:14] they said when the world happened to you
[1:54:15] she said i went to a service
[1:54:17] and i heard a sermon and when he got
[1:54:19] there talking about sympathetic
[1:54:20] resonance and he explained it that way
[1:54:22] said i never thought of it like that she
[1:54:23] said i realized that's a deep call to a
[1:54:26] deep that's god moving in my life
[1:54:29] see
[1:54:30] so don't ever
[1:54:32] give up friends don't write people off
[1:54:34] let's let god determine that the word as
[1:54:37] long as we're still here there's still a
[1:54:38] chance
[1:54:40] hallelujah then let's double our effort
[1:54:42] to be the living word let's double our
[1:54:44] effort to preach it without fear
[1:54:47] let's double our effort to call the
[1:54:49] spirit of god down in our services
[1:54:52] hallelujah
[1:54:54] bring him with you when you come
[1:54:57] amen
[1:54:59] the bible talks about people who are
[1:55:03] fools and slow of heart to believe
[1:55:04] everything that god has done and jesus
[1:55:06] used that sometimes even to speak to his
[1:55:09] own
[1:55:09] his own children
[1:55:11] cleopas and his companions on the road
[1:55:13] to emmaus got that rebuke
[1:55:16] they weren't the only ones jesus said
[1:55:18] you know he would just just say it in
[1:55:20] different ways he said
[1:55:21] you know
[1:55:24] here's the word of god
[1:55:25] in which you think you have eternal life
[1:55:29] and actually it testifies of me
[1:55:32] and so you have no problem seeing the
[1:55:34] written version but it's the living
[1:55:36] version you gotta you're stuck on
[1:55:38] see
[1:55:39] and and and jesus would say
[1:55:43] because they already had a faith in this
[1:55:46] but he said unless you believe that i
[1:55:50] am he you'll die in your sins
[1:55:53] see now that's another step
[1:55:55] that's asking someone to go beyond the
[1:55:57] natural to go beyond human
[1:55:59] uh constraint
[1:56:01] and
[1:56:02] that now you're starting to get to
[1:56:04] perfect faith now you're starting to get
[1:56:06] to total deliverance because i believe
[1:56:08] we've arrived at the age of total
[1:56:10] deliverance
[1:56:13] but sometimes people can be very foolish
[1:56:16] very slow of heart
[1:56:17] to believe everything that god has done
[1:56:21] we find you know here
[1:56:23] in the last day where
[1:56:27] i don't know it's it's kind of like man
[1:56:29] believes
[1:56:30] that he's his own highest achievement
[1:56:35] please
[1:56:37] and and
[1:56:38] you know he he chase you say well
[1:56:41] you know what are you going to base that
[1:56:42] on well the fact that he he continually
[1:56:45] chases after his own pleasure and
[1:56:46] happiness
[1:56:48] and disregards this
[1:56:50] that this is the true pursuit of
[1:56:51] happiness
[1:56:53] and so you know he
[1:56:55] he never he never ends up realizing that
[1:56:58] that he's just a tiny speck on a tiny
[1:57:00] little ball in an incomprehensibly large
[1:57:03] universe
[1:57:04] just a little tiny just a little tiny
[1:57:06] speck
[1:57:07] on a little tiny ball
[1:57:09] hanging in an in
[1:57:11] incomprehensible and it's
[1:57:12] incomprehensible
[1:57:14] how large and how vast the universe is
[1:57:18] you remember i i showed the
[1:57:20] that latest nasa um
[1:57:23] or it was actually a news it was uh i
[1:57:25] think it was a abc news interviewing
[1:57:27] nasa and they were talking about the
[1:57:29] hubble telescope just what it could see
[1:57:31] now they've released is it the web
[1:57:34] from from the scientist
[1:57:36] yeah and and now they're saying that's
[1:57:38] going to be like a hundred times more
[1:57:39] powerful and just with the hubble
[1:57:43] just with the hubble which is now ain't
[1:57:45] old tech
[1:57:46] they were able to see
[1:57:48] that there are more galaxies no one's
[1:57:51] not talking about planets and stars a
[1:57:52] galaxy contains millions
[1:57:55] each each galaxy the milky way is a
[1:57:57] small galaxy that they could that the
[1:58:00] hubble could identify
[1:58:02] and prove that there are more galaxies
[1:58:05] in the universe
[1:58:07] then are contained in all the grains of
[1:58:10] sand
[1:58:11] on all the beaches of the earth
[1:58:14] and the and you remember you saw it with
[1:58:16] me i played it here 15 minutes something
[1:58:18] another and the reporter said
[1:58:22] more than
[1:58:23] more than the grains of sand on a beach
[1:58:26] and he said more than all the beaches
[1:58:29] more than all the grains of sand on all
[1:58:32] the beaches
[1:58:33] they can see more galaxies than that
[1:58:38] our future is bright
[1:58:41] our future is bright i'll tell you some
[1:58:43] friends we're headed somewhere and i
[1:58:44] just say oh good he got a goody lord
[1:58:47] let's get on with it all but but i don't
[1:58:49] want a shortcut i want to finish my
[1:58:51] mission how many want to finish our
[1:58:52] mission
[1:58:54] say what is my mission to come to
[1:58:55] perfect deliverance to come to total
[1:58:57] faith perfect faith total deliverance
[1:59:00] to see a bride in his very image
[1:59:04] oh my trying to comprehend a god that
[1:59:06] can't begin to fathom
[1:59:09] and how that this great being
[1:59:11] offered mankind everything and he
[1:59:13] spurned it and the bible says in their
[1:59:15] wisdom
[1:59:16] they became fools
[1:59:19] all their fame i
[1:59:21] i remember commenting on this
[1:59:24] in the services i've been
[1:59:26] preaching
[1:59:27] so out so much that and it just keeps
[1:59:30] resounding in my in my spirit especially
[1:59:32] relevant to young people
[1:59:34] because you can take famous people
[1:59:37] and philosophers and people who have
[1:59:39] achieved great accomplishments
[1:59:41] i mean i'm glad there was a thomas
[1:59:43] edison i'm glad we got lights
[1:59:44] you understand i'm i'm glad for the
[1:59:47] automobile i'm i'm glad for the jet
[1:59:49] airplane i'm glad for these things but
[1:59:51] you know the thing about it is
[1:59:54] there's been millions of great people
[1:59:56] like that who left a great heritage that
[1:59:59] you and i enjoy
[2:00:00] and yet today they don't necessarily
[2:00:02] enjoy it
[2:00:04] unless they ever at one time committed
[2:00:06] their heart to the lord jesus christ and
[2:00:09] allowed a supernatural new birth to take
[2:00:11] place
[2:00:12] they're you're enjoying their heritage
[2:00:15] but their heritage for them is zero
[2:00:19] they get no benefit of it today
[2:00:22] because we can see in history that
[2:00:24] although they knew the word of god
[2:00:26] they they railed against it they said he
[2:00:28] wasn't real they spent their whole life
[2:00:30] trying to disprove it and i just say
[2:00:32] then no wonder the word would call you a
[2:00:35] fool
[2:00:36] you don't realize you're a tiny speck on
[2:00:38] a tiny ball in a vast universe and
[2:00:40] there's a great being who put all of
[2:00:42] this thing in prophet said he rolled it
[2:00:44] off his hand
[2:00:46] oh my friends you know we
[2:00:49] we find that all of their
[2:00:50] accomplishments
[2:00:52] how very sad for them because they they
[2:00:55] gain no value of it what value is there
[2:00:58] no matter how good
[2:01:00] no matter how good
[2:01:03] an accomplishment that you or i might
[2:01:05] make
[2:01:08] what value is it
[2:01:10] if it's not eternal
[2:01:13] because it's not eternal has to end i
[2:01:14] don't care how valuable you think it is
[2:01:16] it's going to end
[2:01:17] see
[2:01:18] and so so so we realized then that that
[2:01:21] that it's you know
[2:01:23] uh if it's not eternal
[2:01:25] then it is a it is a joy that must end
[2:01:28] in sadness because it'll have eventual
[2:01:30] loss now i get that i mean even true
[2:01:32] love always ends in loss it has to
[2:01:36] many of you today here have experienced
[2:01:38] the loss of loved ones true love always
[2:01:40] ends in loss it's it's always going to
[2:01:42] there's never a way that true love is
[2:01:44] not going to end in sad loss
[2:01:46] but then to say well then fine then i
[2:01:48] just won't love then if you don't love
[2:01:49] you don't live
[2:01:51] see so aren't you glad there's a heaven
[2:01:54] aren't you glad there's an eternal life
[2:01:56] aren't you glad brother branham said it
[2:01:58] like this and it sounds crazy aren't you
[2:02:00] glad there's something called death
[2:02:03] that can take us out of this pest house
[2:02:05] and put us in another world
[2:02:08] oh my where every day is the glory of
[2:02:10] god and there's no more anxiety and
[2:02:12] stress and sickness and pain and sorrow
[2:02:14] and parting it's all
[2:02:17] hallelujah i'm living for that hour
[2:02:19] friends i've got my whole life dedicated
[2:02:21] to that hour
[2:02:23] to that very moment
[2:02:25] where on the other side death is done
[2:02:27] away with forever
[2:02:30] separation and the the certainty of all
[2:02:33] good things coming to an end is done
[2:02:34] away with forever
[2:02:37] isaiah
[2:02:38] prophesies and here's here's material
[2:02:41] that brother branham
[2:02:42] was able to correlate to our modern day
[2:02:45] arise and shine isaiah 60 josh isaiah 60
[2:02:49] verses 1 and 2
[2:02:51] arise shine for thy light has come
[2:02:54] and the glory of the lord has risen upon
[2:02:56] thee
[2:02:57] for behold the darkness shall cover the
[2:03:00] earth and gross darkness the people
[2:03:03] but the lord shall arise upon thee and
[2:03:05] his glory shall be seen upon thee now
[2:03:08] it well i'm not going to take the time
[2:03:10] to do it today but
[2:03:12] if you if you just go up into into the
[2:03:14] chapter right before into chapter 59
[2:03:17] you'll read about the condition of the
[2:03:20] world at the
[2:03:22] dawning of this time when you uh
[2:03:25] when when isaiah 60
[2:03:27] one and two
[2:03:28] comes to pass and it has
[2:03:30] and we're we're in it we're in this
[2:03:32] fulfillment
[2:03:33] darkness over the earth and gross
[2:03:35] darkness over the people we're here
[2:03:37] it's happened you've arrived
[2:03:40] amen and there there there there's not
[2:03:43] an another one it's not going to get
[2:03:45] better
[2:03:46] there's not another cycle you're in the
[2:03:48] last one
[2:03:50] you're not got another revival coming to
[2:03:52] combat it you've got your revival
[2:03:55] to combat it
[2:03:56] after this it's an exodus
[2:03:59] wow
[2:04:00] and and when you go into chapter 59 you
[2:04:02] want to go home today and read it you'll
[2:04:04] be amazed at how how
[2:04:07] perfectly in line the 59th chapter is
[2:04:10] with the conditions we have in the world
[2:04:12] today yeah brother matt could have just
[2:04:14] took isaiah 59 and preached on modern
[2:04:15] events made clear prophecy and
[2:04:17] correlated everything right back to it
[2:04:19] and and i'm not going to take the time
[2:04:20] to do it i'm really out of time now but
[2:04:22] i i just want to press on just a little
[2:04:23] bit more
[2:04:25] but we find that it's going to show the
[2:04:27] condition of the age at the time of
[2:04:29] isaiah 60 because the the the beauty of
[2:04:33] isaiah 60 is that it calls forth a bride
[2:04:37] to become a perfection of christ to come
[2:04:40] into his very image to be the measured
[2:04:42] perfection of christ the tabernacle of
[2:04:44] the living god
[2:04:46] you know it's we would never know
[2:04:49] one great commentator made this
[2:04:51] statement we would never know the mind
[2:04:53] of god
[2:04:55] until we learn
[2:04:57] to know the voice of god
[2:05:00] and i thought about that for quite a bit
[2:05:02] and and he was actually
[2:05:04] he was actually
[2:05:05] you you you could see in his uh
[2:05:08] in his devotional that he's he's
[2:05:11] believing that there's got to come
[2:05:13] something more he can see the trouble
[2:05:16] within his own movement he can see that
[2:05:18] that revival of azusa hasn't quite it it
[2:05:22] seems to have stalled it seems to have
[2:05:24] gone off track and and and this this
[2:05:26] great leader among them was very
[2:05:28] troubled over it and he starts
[2:05:30] forecasting you can recon you can read
[2:05:32] it almost like reading between the lines
[2:05:34] you can see the longing of his heart to
[2:05:36] say you know i believe that there's got
[2:05:38] to come something
[2:05:39] i all hope is not not lost there's
[2:05:41] there's got to come something there's
[2:05:43] got to come a revival and he's and he
[2:05:45] says because we would never know the
[2:05:46] mind of god until we until we learn to
[2:05:49] know the voice of god and this is what
[2:05:51] god has provided for us he wasn't wrong
[2:05:55] he wasn't wrong god did exactly that has
[2:05:58] provided us a voice in this last day you
[2:06:01] know it here here's something that a lot
[2:06:03] of people miss is that
[2:06:06] jesus you know in one in one way he
[2:06:09] would say i've told you all things
[2:06:13] and i've withheld nothing
[2:06:15] and that same jesus would would look him
[2:06:17] in the eye at another time and go
[2:06:20] now what i do now you don't know
[2:06:22] but you'll know
[2:06:24] after
[2:06:26] see because
[2:06:27] the holy ghost will come he the holy
[2:06:29] ghost
[2:06:30] and when he comes
[2:06:32] he'll remind you
[2:06:34] he'll lead you and guide you into all
[2:06:35] truth and he'll remind you of what i'm
[2:06:38] saying now and you might forget it and
[2:06:40] then the bible sure enough it follows
[2:06:42] suit that the by the the here they go
[2:06:45] into a situation and the bible says and
[2:06:47] they remembered oh yeah that's what he
[2:06:50] no that's what he meant
[2:06:52] now we see it and you know what did that
[2:06:54] unfolding manifestation
[2:06:57] it wasn't that jesus needed to come back
[2:07:00] and preach more doctrine
[2:07:02] you understand
[2:07:04] what he preached was spirit and life and
[2:07:06] it was going to come into material
[2:07:09] and that's why you need the spirit of
[2:07:12] god upon your life not an eighth
[2:07:14] messenger
[2:07:16] you understand we don't need another
[2:07:18] super
[2:07:20] we're not even supposed to chase supers
[2:07:22] and and the bride gets let us let off
[2:07:24] the trap i've raised up in this message
[2:07:27] and my whole life i've seen one
[2:07:29] off left of center camp and another one
[2:07:32] and another one another i'm going what
[2:07:34] is wrong with you people
[2:07:36] that why why why why why are you what is
[2:07:39] in you or a better question is what's
[2:07:41] missing
[2:07:43] that you're always chasing after
[2:07:44] something like that
[2:07:46] the next greatest minister the next
[2:07:48] greatest camp the next greatest
[2:07:50] revelation the next greatest this the
[2:07:51] next greatest thing i'm here to tell you
[2:07:53] something friends it's all for one and
[2:07:54] one for all the ground is level at the
[2:07:56] foot of calvary and god is not a
[2:07:58] respecter of persons and you don't need
[2:08:01] you don't need me or another man you
[2:08:03] need christ
[2:08:04] to make his word alive inside your life
[2:08:09] lift you up above the shadows and set
[2:08:11] you on a higher plane
[2:08:13] this is what we're desiring friends this
[2:08:15] is what this is the life that is in the
[2:08:18] word this is what i'm pouring out my
[2:08:19] heart to you today it's it's there's
[2:08:21] life in the word of god but it's not
[2:08:23] accumulating knowledge and it's not just
[2:08:26] a it's not just the running wild of
[2:08:28] emotions but it's something real that
[2:08:31] has a balance to it and it seeks to know
[2:08:33] him in the power of his resurrection
[2:08:37] being in fellowship with his sufferings
[2:08:39] made conformable unto his death
[2:08:43] see and so it would take the holy spirit
[2:08:45] in the lives of the apostles to bring
[2:08:47] his teaching word
[2:08:49] into a form of manifested life and so
[2:08:53] therefore it's very very vital today
[2:08:55] for that exact reason it's vital today
[2:08:58] that we have an open book
[2:09:00] that would that we have a restored word
[2:09:03] that we have a mighty god
[2:09:05] unveiled
[2:09:07] unsealed because when when when christ
[2:09:10] was unsealed
[2:09:11] under the opening of the seventh seal it
[2:09:14] also unsealed the bride
[2:09:16] it when he was unveiled it unveiled her
[2:09:19] and i there's not a lot of quotes i
[2:09:20] could read to you today but i'm i i
[2:09:23] don't even know if i'm going to show
[2:09:24] them i uh
[2:09:25] i might run through them quickly but
[2:09:28] but we find that that it takes the holy
[2:09:31] spirit to do this
[2:09:33] brother branham describes it like this
[2:09:35] and this is a mashup of teaching from a
[2:09:38] couple of different sermons and i i
[2:09:40] probably i probably
[2:09:42] better at least give you a couple of
[2:09:43] quotes anyway today take that down
[2:09:45] brother josh and give me my powerpoint
[2:09:47] just so that
[2:09:48] just so that i can establish what i'm
[2:09:50] saying
[2:09:51] on a prophet's message because let me
[2:09:53] let me make this point too because i
[2:09:54] don't have this one in quotes but this
[2:09:56] is also
[2:09:57] something the prophet taught how that i
[2:09:59] don't remember it seemed like it's one
[2:10:00] of his easter seal sermons i don't
[2:10:01] remember which one
[2:10:03] and even that may stand correction but
[2:10:04] i'm pretty sure it was in one of them
[2:10:06] where brother branham describes
[2:10:07] something as sealed
[2:10:10] and he says now
[2:10:11] when when something is sealed
[2:10:14] he says it has something sealed up on
[2:10:17] the inside
[2:10:19] see now he's he's talking about the word
[2:10:21] of god coming forth all right the word
[2:10:24] for this hour and you're going to see
[2:10:25] that in these quotes in just a minute
[2:10:26] the word for this hour and what did it
[2:10:28] come to do what what was the opening of
[2:10:30] the seals you think oh that was just
[2:10:31] some just some by interpretation of of
[2:10:34] the book of revelation and
[2:10:36] all we did was translate some some
[2:10:39] apocalyptic symbols and told you what
[2:10:41] the red dragon was and who the mighty
[2:10:43] angel was my goodness friends it is so
[2:10:45] much more than that
[2:10:47] it's why the book of revelation is the
[2:10:48] bride's book i mean yet paul you don't
[2:10:51] see paul quoting from the book of
[2:10:52] revelation why he's already gone by the
[2:10:53] time john comes back with it there
[2:10:56] there's no there's no teaching on it at
[2:10:57] all it was it was reserved for the last
[2:11:00] day
[2:11:01] when a prophet would take it up and
[2:11:02] start with the revelation of jesus
[2:11:05] christ
[2:11:06] that's where he began that's where
[2:11:08] everything must begin
[2:11:10] the revelation of jesus christ that's
[2:11:13] not just knowledge that's the person of
[2:11:16] christ coming into you and that is the
[2:11:18] revelation that's how you know him
[2:11:20] because he's become one with you you've
[2:11:22] become one with him and brother brenham
[2:11:24] describes it in this way how that when
[2:11:26] the seal is broken
[2:11:28] it releases
[2:11:30] what's on the inside now when the seals
[2:11:33] broke what it released was his full word
[2:11:36] back to the church but now watch it's
[2:11:38] not just doctrine brother branham said
[2:11:41] then down comes an anointing
[2:11:44] upon that word to make it live inside
[2:11:49] your lives
[2:11:51] you see what i'm saying friends so it's
[2:11:53] not just the accumulation of knowledge
[2:11:55] word and neither is it the neither is it
[2:11:58] the exercise of frolic and emotions in a
[2:12:00] church service it's the word is spirit
[2:12:03] and life and it's received with people
[2:12:06] who love god and are willing to have the
[2:12:08] word of god sown into their life and
[2:12:10] become the image of the word and god
[2:12:12] moves in a living way among the people
[2:12:15] and it changes lives it makes teenagers
[2:12:17] live holy and dress holy it makes
[2:12:19] marriages come out of disorder into
[2:12:21] order it causes ministry to have signs
[2:12:24] following and an evident fruit of the
[2:12:26] ministry
[2:12:28] it produces something in your lives
[2:12:34] see that anointing that to make it live
[2:12:36] and you're going to see here the
[2:12:38] anointing is clearly it's a it's a
[2:12:39] person i'll just tip you off
[2:12:42] the anointing is not a fuzzy feeling
[2:12:45] it's a person all right watch
[2:12:50] oh let me turn on
[2:12:52] life in the word the anointing of not a
[2:12:55] spirit
[2:12:57] the spirit
[2:12:58] 1964 and i've got i'm going to read you
[2:13:00] one from 64 and 1165 i want to put them
[2:13:02] in chronological order paradox now what
[2:13:04] is it
[2:13:06] christ coming to his body
[2:13:08] christ is the word we all know
[2:13:11] the anointing is christ
[2:13:13] that comes on the word
[2:13:15] that makes the word live is that right
[2:13:17] is that right
[2:13:19] how many have proved that's right
[2:13:21] see
[2:13:24] that is the anointing christ is
[2:13:27] the anointing
[2:13:29] the spirit that comes upon the word
[2:13:31] that quickens the word
[2:13:33] to make it live now the word is in your
[2:13:37] heart you you believe in divine healing
[2:13:40] whatever more see

[2:14:00] you understand that's a connection
[2:14:03] just like husband and wife to become one
[2:14:05] now watch him flip it
[2:14:08] now here's his segue now the church
[2:14:11] has got to get to the ministry
[2:14:13] until to that level
[2:14:15] that's what we're that's our level of
[2:14:17] ministry to make this connection
[2:14:19] you understand
[2:14:21] that to get to the church and christ
[2:14:24] become one
[2:14:25] he can anoint you for every blessing
[2:14:28] that's in the bible
[2:14:30] all of it is
[2:14:32] all of it is yours everything promised
[2:14:35] at this age is yours i want you to have
[2:14:39] faith today

[2:15:00] can't help but be a christian it compels
[2:15:02] me to be a christian
[2:15:03] i can't i'm not going to be able to
[2:15:05] avoid a body change it's changing me
[2:15:09] hallelujah
[2:15:12] now he goes to 1965 power of
[2:15:14] transformation why don't you want that
[2:15:15] one
[2:15:17] be not conformed to the world but be
[2:15:19] transformed power of transformation let
[2:15:22] the holy spirit come upon any person
[2:15:24] that's truly got something down there a
[2:15:27] healing comes from the inside
[2:15:30] let that healing come from the spirit
[2:15:32] that's in you if it's a genuine spirit
[2:15:35] anointing the genuine seed
[2:15:38] it can't do nothing but bear a son or
[2:15:42] daughter of god
[2:15:45] what a confidence we should have today
[2:15:48] friends
[2:15:49] that this word that you've believed
[2:15:51] you've not followed cunningly devised
[2:15:53] tales you've not followed something
[2:15:55] that's that's just trying to tickle your
[2:15:56] ears you're not you're not following
[2:15:58] someone that's trying to be fancy or
[2:16:00] popular where you're following the body
[2:16:02] word of the son of man
[2:16:04] you're you're you're you're you're
[2:16:06] hooked in you're connected you're
[2:16:08] connected to heavenly places in christ
[2:16:12] jesus
[2:16:13] that's the life that's what the word was
[2:16:15] set to do
[2:16:18] see
[2:16:19] there's no conflict
[2:16:22] you know it's it's it's so crazy to
[2:16:25] to see
[2:16:26] that that some people joust back and
[2:16:28] forth between
[2:16:30] oh you're
[2:16:31] you know here's some emotion and you're
[2:16:33] too pentecostal and here's here's no
[2:16:35] emotion and you know but it's it's just
[2:16:38] the word we just want the word only and
[2:16:39] you guys are are a bunch of fanatics
[2:16:41] well but you guys are just a bunch of
[2:16:43] dead letter
[2:16:47] say which side you're going to defend
[2:16:48] today neither one
[2:16:51] because it's not neither one
[2:16:54] the bottom line is there ain't no side
[2:16:56] there's only one side
[2:16:58] and his spirit and his life and he's the
[2:17:01] word and he's an anointing and he lives
[2:17:03] hallelujah
[2:17:05] hallelujah it's not an emotion for the
[2:17:06] sake of emotion it's neither is it
[2:17:08] accumulating of knowledge it's a living
[2:17:10] breathing experience of the holy ghost
[2:17:13] that comes into your life and makes the
[2:17:16] promises of god come to pass
[2:17:18] i'm not here to declare a conflict i'm

[2:18:13] always the desire and it's always a fine
[2:18:15] thing i love doing it anyway i do it
[2:18:17] sometimes i only need a reason to it
[2:18:19] i'll get little kids deciding to start
[2:18:21] talking to them about spiritual things
[2:18:23] just to see where they're at
[2:18:26] i love children amen

[2:18:29] they're so wonderful and to see them
[2:18:30] grow up in the beauty of holiness
[2:18:33] and uh
[2:18:35] one mother said to you do you need to
[2:18:36] talk to him because i think mason got
[2:18:38] sprung on he said you need to talk to
[2:18:40] him uh before you baptize him i said no
[2:18:42] i was standing at the altar when he
[2:18:44] tears rolling down his face
[2:18:46] amen amen he wanted more god amen i want
[2:18:48] to tell you something friends that's
[2:18:50] what we're trying to accomplish here
[2:18:52] and i i've watched brother landon i've
[2:18:54] watched him grow i've watched his spirit
[2:18:55] in his nature and
[2:18:57] what what beauty
[2:18:59] i'm so appreciative of you families
[2:19:02] who take the time
[2:19:04] who put in the the the time
[2:19:07] and spend the effort
[2:19:10] to raise them
[2:19:12] to nurture them
[2:19:14] to to
[2:19:15] to demonstrate god
[2:19:17] to them
[2:19:19] to they see you remember brother brandon
[2:19:20] was such a sad story when brother brown
[2:19:22] tells it
[2:19:24] he said all my life
[2:19:26] i was raised to think god hated me but
[2:19:28] jesus loved me
[2:19:31] what a torture for a
[2:19:32] child i mean you see you see what that
[2:19:35] catholicism
[2:19:37] influence in his family had tried to do
[2:19:39] god hates you but jesus loves you
[2:19:42] what a conflict what a conflicted person
[2:19:45] brother branham was he was so conflicted
[2:19:47] he didn't even know god but he was
[2:19:48] terrified he was going to die
[2:19:50] without his mercy
[2:19:52] and he's he's laying there remember he
[2:19:54] tells the story he said i was out there
[2:19:56] i think around phoenix and he was
[2:19:57] pushing cattle on on a ranch and
[2:20:01] he said oh slim we sitting by the fire
[2:20:03] one night and said slim reached in and
[2:20:04] got that
[2:20:05] comb like a homemade harmonica almost
[2:20:08] and he said it had a reed on it and he
[2:20:10] started
[2:20:11] started blowing on that and
[2:20:13] you know some real tender
[2:20:15] song about the lord and christ i forget
[2:20:17] now which one it was
[2:20:19] and brother branham said i would just i
[2:20:21] would i'd pull the cover over my head i
[2:20:23] didn't want to hear that
[2:20:25] you know and jesus keep me near the
[2:20:28] cross or something like that
[2:20:30] and he said and finally they would quit
[2:20:32] and he said i would
[2:20:34] pull my cover back and he said i'd lay
[2:20:36] there
[2:20:37] and i'd look up at those stars that
[2:20:39] beautiful western sky
[2:20:42] and he said tears would roll down my
[2:20:44] face he said i could hear the wind
[2:20:46] blowing through the trees and it seemed
[2:20:47] to say adam
[2:20:50] where art thou son
[2:20:53] and he said i look up at those heavens
[2:20:54] and those beautiful celestials and he
[2:20:57] said tears would run down my face and he
[2:20:58] said i would say please sir
[2:21:00] please sir
[2:21:02] don't destroy me before i can have a
[2:21:04] chance to find you
[2:21:06] oh there's so much value
[2:21:08] in getting a child to surrender to the
[2:21:10] lord right off the bat
[2:21:12] there's so much value parents don't ever
[2:21:14] think you that that should be your
[2:21:16] primary focus that should be the zenith
[2:21:19] of all of your efforts everything you
[2:21:22] you
[2:21:23] try to achieve and strive for should be
[2:21:26] to be christ
[2:21:28] be an example be a living word raise
[2:21:31] them in the admonition of god train them
[2:21:34] bring them up in the ways of god don't
[2:21:37] make the spirit of god a foreign thing

[2:36:02] had a dream from god and said don't be
[2:36:04] afraid this is what you're going to do
[2:36:06] and he he woke up and immediately went
[2:36:07] and did it and brother donald saw
[2:36:09] himself in water
[2:36:11] and uh and the spirit of god speaking
[2:36:14] out to be baptized in the name of the
