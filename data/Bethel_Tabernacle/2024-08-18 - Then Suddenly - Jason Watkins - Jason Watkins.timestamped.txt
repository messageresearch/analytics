[43:47] Verse
[43:52] 54 and when he was come into his own
[43:55] country
[43:57] he taught them in their synagogue in so
[44:00] much that they were
[44:02] astonished and said whence hath this man
[44:06] this wisdom and these Mighty works is
[44:09] not this The Carpenter's son is not his
[44:12] mother called Mary and his Brethren
[44:14] James and Joseph and Simon and Judas and
[44:17] his sisters are they not all with us
[44:20] whence then hath this man all these
[44:24] things so it's obvious
[44:27] they knew him and he hadn't demonstrated
[44:30] any of this before until suddenly one
[44:34] day he did and they were shocked the
[44:37] Bible says they were
[44:38] astonished verse
[44:40] 57 and they were offended in him imagine
[44:44] that but Jesus said unto them a prophet
[44:47] is not without honor Sav in his own
[44:48] country and in his own house the Bible
[44:51] goes on to talk about many mighty Works
[44:54] he couldn't do because of their unbelief
[44:57] amen so you don't want to find
[44:59] yourself astonished to the at God in
[45:04] anything that he does or anything he
[45:08] allows in your life because he might
[45:10] suddenly let the world turn upside down
[45:12] on you or he might suddenly bring you
[45:15] out of a dark trial and suddenly the
[45:17] clouds break and the sun is out and
[45:18] you're not almost out you're not light
[45:20] at the end of the tunnel you're just out
[45:23] suddenly the world is about to
[45:25] experience the sudden secret coming of
[45:28] the Lord amen the bride is the bride is
[45:32] about to experience the sudden secret
[45:34] catching away of the Lord amen praise
[45:39] the Lord let's
[45:41] pray father we thank you for your word
[45:44] today and I just relax my own Spirit
[45:47] Lord I'm I'm an anxious to cover this
[45:50] material and I ask for your Divine help
[45:53] today may you be with me may you give us
[45:56] all quickened Hearts this morning to
[45:58] believe every word we commit ourselves
[46:01] into your hands in Jesus name amen amen
[46:05] God bless you you can be seated amen
[46:08] praise the Lord and the Lord touch
[46:11] brother Mark brother Jack and this lady
[46:14] for Brother Bruce Lord have mercy on
[46:16] that
[46:18] situation how many know him to be a
[46:20] merciful god amen he sure is my goodness
[46:25] he has come to me in at times where I
[46:28] got to the point where you know and God
[46:32] sometimes not only does he shock you in
[46:36] his
[46:37] suddenness but he astonishes you in how
[46:40] he does it I've had the Lord come to me
[46:43] before when I was suffering with a
[46:45] sickness I remember standing in brother
[46:47] Tim PR's uh guest bedroom and I had
[46:50] meetings there in lisiana and and I was
[46:53] scheduled to preach and it was starting
[46:54] that night Friday Saturday Sunday and I
[46:56] was just at the end with the stomach
[46:58] condition and I was on
[47:02] quadruple prescription medication and
[47:05] could not get relief and I was standing
[47:08] there in such Agony in my stomach that
[47:11] and when that happens to me it feels
[47:13] like the only way I've ever been able to
[47:15] describe it is if you can imagine
[47:18] swallowing a baseball and it's just
[47:20] stuck right there it's not heartburn
[47:23] it's pain that almost you can't function
[47:27] and so I just stood there and I had been
[47:30] praying and praying and praying I went
[47:32] to the meetings praying I got there
[47:35] praying I'm standing in the bedroom I've
[47:37] been praying all day I've been trying to
[47:38] study I'm Walking the Floor Services you
[47:41] know 45 minutes away we're getting ready
[47:44] to leave the house and and I just I'm
[47:47] standing there in the room and I just
[47:49] said Lord I can't go on you've got to
[47:55] heal me
[47:58] and suddenly very softly nothing there
[48:01] was no Thunder there was no lightning a
[48:04] voice just spoke just just a snatch less
[48:07] than an audible voice in the room that's
[48:09] how clearly I heard it and all it said
[48:12] was all right you're
[48:16] healed that was it and I stood there for
[48:19] a minute and I just
[48:21] went okay man said I'm Healed okay I'm
[48:25] Healed and I took a step and I was
[48:28] healed amen and I've had the Lord do
[48:30] that a number of times I remember in a
[48:32] deep dark trial one time impossible no
[48:34] way to get out of it a financial
[48:36] situation many years ago that I'd got
[48:38] myself into and I just said Lord you've
[48:41] got to deliver me I was laying there in
[48:43] the bed just tears because I knew I did
[48:45] it to myself and I said Lord you've got
[48:48] to deliver me a and that same exact
[48:52] voice said all right you're
[48:55] delivered and in 72 hours this happened
[48:59] this happened this happened and I was
[49:00] out and I don't mean light at the end of
[49:03] the tunnel I mean I was out and it was
[49:05] so sudden and so shocking and it left me
[49:10] astonished at the Lord Brother
[49:12] brandham said he preached a whole sermon
[49:15] and a number of other sermons similar to
[49:17] this one but he comes with a title and
[49:20] he says God
[49:23] moves uh God does the unexpected
[49:27] am in unexplainable ways in his Kentucky
[49:31] way of saying it I want you to catch
[49:33] that again God says brother BR says that
[49:36] God does the
[49:39] unexpected in unexplainable ways amen so
[49:44] now I want to just u pull up my
[49:47] PowerPoint we're going to jump right
[49:48] into it I I purposely put this up let's
[49:51] have my title slide Brother Jay and uh
[49:54] we'll we'll get going through it amen
[49:56] praise the Lord all right so I want to
[49:59] take this title today then suddenly and
[50:02] I'm taking for a subtitle God doing the
[50:06] unexpected in an unexplainable way amen
[50:10] all right now I just want to refer you
[50:12] to a few scriptures just to so you get
[50:15] your mind caught up with me on this
[50:17] whole idea of suddenly all right it's
[50:20] very familiar to us Acts 2 verse 1 and 2
[50:24] and when the day of Pentecost was full
[50:26] fly come they were all with one Accord
[50:31] in one place and what suddenly there
[50:36] came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing
[50:39] Mighty Wind and it filled the house
[50:41] where they were sitting I'm going to
[50:43] read you some commentary on that word
[50:45] suddenly from manage thinkers be
[50:48] brilliant Beautiful Mind of of ministers
[50:50] down Through the Ages who who have a
[50:52] take on this word suddenly why does why
[50:55] does Dr Luke write this word suddenly
[50:58] see and he's got a purpose in it and its
[51:01] own purpose it's intentional and he's
[51:03] trying to get your attention all right
[51:05] now here's another verse that doesn't
[51:09] use the word suddenly but it's going to
[51:11] be necessary in my
[51:13] sermon Job
[51:15] 14 but man dieth and wasteth way yay man
[51:21] giveth up The Ghost and where is he now
[51:23] that's been an age-old question people
[51:26] still asking that today and some of them
[51:28] conclude well you're just nowhere this
[51:30] is it when you're done here you're done
[51:31] there is no next see and so they think
[51:34] we're all fooling theirselves well
[51:36] they're wrong because I know my redeemer
[51:39] liveth see he say how do you know
[51:42] because I've met him I talked to him who
[51:44] do you think spoke to me twice and said
[51:47] okay you're healed okay you're delivered
[51:49] that was it and I was both times when it
[51:53] was impossible for it to happen
[51:56] he comes down to verse 14 here's the
[51:59] here's the here's the conundrum of
[52:01] humanity for Millennia multiple
[52:03] Millennia if a man die job could see the
[52:07] trees and the grass and they went down
[52:08] and they came back but if a man die
[52:12] shall he live again he's asking Lord is
[52:15] there an after this I is this it is
[52:19] there an after life now that's an
[52:22] important question because if there is
[52:26] then you need to think about what Jesus
[52:28] said concerning laying up Treasures for
[52:31] it if it's
[52:33] there now Jesus assured you it was there
[52:36] and the fact is I love brother Abraham's
[52:38] take on that he says I go away to he
[52:41] says in my father's house or many
[52:43] mansions and if it weren't so I would
[52:45] tell you and brother abam says you know
[52:47] Jesus was just so honest that he said to
[52:50] the people listen I if I was a fake I
[52:53] would just admit it if none of this was
[52:56] true I would just tell you I would just
[52:58] own it I'm not a deceiver but in my
[53:01] father's house are many
[53:03] mansions and I and guess what I'm going
[53:05] to prepare that place to receive
[53:08] you see so it's real and it's true and
[53:14] there is if a man dies shall he live
[53:16] again all the days of my of my appointed
[53:20] time will I wait till my change
[53:23] comes Joel would go on to catch a
[53:26] revelation by a vision he would see he
[53:28] said I know my redeemer liveth and on
[53:30] the last day I'll see him these eyes I
[53:33] myself will see it so it was the
[53:37] promise of a redeemer why is that
[53:41] important because when you die you're
[53:43] suddenly going to be somewhere
[53:46] else when Jesus was long enough in the
[53:50] Tomb he suddenly the Bible talks about
[53:52] there came an earthquake and there came
[53:54] an angel and rolled the stone away and
[53:56] and there was an an earthquake on his
[53:58] resurrection morning and out he come and
[54:00] it was so shocking that here you have uh
[54:05] here you have Mary talking to him and
[54:08] she thinks he's a gardener it's
[54:10] so
[54:12] inconceivable that this could be the
[54:15] Lord think of how astonished that she
[54:18] was think of how astonished you would be
[54:22] if you if you were talking to a person
[54:25] and sudden realize it's your lost loved
[54:28] one who crossed over years ago and now
[54:29] they here they aren't a young body
[54:31] imagine your shock when you suddenly re
[54:34] wreck oh my goodness
[54:36] see so so he goes on now watch here's
[54:40] another
[54:41] one behold Malachi 3:1 behold I will
[54:46] send my
[54:48] messenger and he shall prepare the way
[54:52] before me and the Lord whom you seek
[54:56] shall suddenly come to his Temple even
[55:00] the messenger of the Covenant whom you
[55:02] Delight in behold he shall come sayith
[55:05] the Lord of hosts and you know from the
[55:08] time Israel had its last prophet it's
[55:12] like
[55:14] 400
[55:16] years until finally John just comes out
[55:19] of the Wilderness nobody had seen him
[55:21] since a boy 9 years old his parents pass
[55:24] away he goes into the wilderness he's
[55:26] raised by the Lord like like like a wild
[55:28] man he comes out eating W you know wild
[55:31] locust and wild and and wild and honey
[55:34] and he's wrapped in a in Camel's hair
[55:36] and he looks anything but like a prophet
[55:38] at least what they were expecting I'm
[55:40] here to tell you God all always takes
[55:42] the form the world's not Desiring it to
[55:45] be in but it's still
[55:47] him the world because it's that's that
[55:51] doesn't mean there's the world's full of
[55:53] all bad people it just means that Satan
[55:55] is the god of the age
[55:56] and he's always wanted Christ's Kingdom
[55:59] he's always wanted it for himself and so
[56:02] he always goes after it in ways of
[56:05] beauty and ways of uh you know of
[56:08] education and ways of Science and ways
[56:10] of culture he has always done that he
[56:13] has never not done it that way I don't
[56:17] know why people would think today he's
[56:19] going to suddenly change his plan that
[56:21] he's been using very successfully may I
[56:24] end for 6,000 years
[56:26] and so he he managed to deceive the
[56:29] analivian world he managed to deceive
[56:31] Nimrod he managed to deceive all of the
[56:33] great conquerors down Through the Ages
[56:35] he managed to deceive the Caesars of
[56:38] Rome he managed to deceive the church he
[56:41] he man he's always and he comes down to
[56:43] the end time and I'm here to tell you
[56:45] the the word is not like what the
[56:48] general Christian world says it is and
[56:51] Christ is not like they portray him to
[56:53] be and Christians are something
[56:55] different than what the world and that's
[56:58] not abnormal that's natural that's
[57:01] normal it should be
[57:04] expected amen but when the world sees
[57:08] you they think you're
[57:10] weird how's that
[57:13] possible they think you're a cult really
[57:16] me us here here we are we we're
[57:20] wholesome families and love God and
[57:23] Holiness Reigns Supreme we have the
[57:25] token of applied to our home the
[57:27] supernatural Works Among Us people's
[57:30] lives are completely changed from
[57:31] Darkness to light and and somehow we're
[57:35] we're weird and we're CAU and we're
[57:36] wrong when has the Church the true
[57:39] church ever not been like
[57:43] us oh my yeah you're listen friends let
[57:48] me tell you young people let me tell you
[57:50] here me you have not followed cunningly
[57:52] devised Tales you're following a very
[57:54] ancient truth
[57:56] and it's and and all this message in the
[57:58] world is all it is in the world is what
[58:01] God promised he would do a restoration
[58:03] of the original truth it's not anything
[58:05] different than that see we didn't need
[58:07] to write another Bible like the Mormons
[58:09] we didn't need one we got this one this
[58:11] the one we go by we didn't need to come
[58:14] up we didn't need to change our name you
[58:16] know we didn't need to do like Jehovah's
[58:17] Witness where Jesus is just a prince
[58:19] he's not he's the king of glory he's God
[58:22] very God we don't everything we stand
[58:26] stand for is provable in this book I
[58:28] challenge the world to prove
[58:30] otherwise see so so it shouldn't be
[58:34] strange but it is strange and when he
[58:38] appears after we're gone to the wedding
[58:41] supper and he suddenly comes out riding
[58:45] on a white horse and the armies of
[58:46] Heaven following and then every eye
[58:48] shall see him it's sudden it's shocking
[58:51] and the people are astonished and they
[58:54] start wailing amen amen I've said so
[58:57] many times how would you imagine a
[58:59] Christian would see Christ and start
[59:02] wailing I mean what you does that inform
[59:04] your thinking does that weigh does that
[59:07] cause you to think about what would
[59:09] cause that these are Christians
[59:11] supposedly and they see Christ and
[59:13] they're afraid and they're wailing
[59:15] why what Christian wouldn't see Christ
[59:18] and both hands would go up and you start
[59:20] screaming
[59:21] Hallelujah
[59:23] see so there there's got to be something
[59:27] behind it now Brother brandham Talks
[59:30] quite
[59:31] extensively
[59:34] um Let me let me let
[59:37] me pause that for a moment did we read
[59:40] it all he shall suddenly come to his
[59:42] Temple right let's read it behold I send
[59:45] my messenger and he shall prepare the
[59:46] way before me and the Lord who whom you
[59:49] seek shall suddenly come to his Temple
[59:52] even the messenger of the Covenant we
[59:53] did read it whom you Delight in behold
[59:56] he shall come sayith the Lord of hosts
[59:59] so in the in this in this appearing it's
[1:00:02] going to be people who Delight in the
[1:00:05] Lord see not not everybody delighted
[1:00:08] when when he came to his Temple when
[1:00:10] Jesus came to his Temple the Bible says
[1:00:13] they were offended at
[1:00:15] him see and he said well a prophet's not
[1:00:18] without you know accepting his own He
[1:00:20] he'll have honor everywhere except the
[1:00:22] people who know him and so but yet even
[1:00:25] still
[1:00:26] when he went into the synagogue a place
[1:00:29] where they claimed they're worshiping
[1:00:30] him and he takes the book and set reads
[1:00:32] Isaiah's prophecy sits down all the eyes
[1:00:35] are fastened upon him and he said this
[1:00:37] day guess what suddenly you should have
[1:00:40] been expecting it I know what I'm about
[1:00:43] to say is going to astonish you but hang
[1:00:46] on breathe it's okay what's happened is
[1:00:50] is it may have snuck up on you I know
[1:00:52] it's been 400 years but you ought to
[1:00:54] have believed John
[1:00:57] you want to have believed I told you I
[1:00:58] would send Elijah before me I did he
[1:01:01] came here I am what's the problem and he
[1:01:05] says this day this scripture is
[1:01:07] fulfilled and they go to try to throw
[1:01:09] him over a
[1:01:12] cliff see you you they're so astonished
[1:01:15] they're so
[1:01:16] stunned that nothing is like they
[1:01:19] thought they knew it was coming it's not
[1:01:21] like they thought it would
[1:01:24] be see but he suddenly comes
[1:01:27] anyway brother brandham goes into a lot
[1:01:30] of detail let me make sure I don't want
[1:01:33] to go yeah correct we'll go there and
[1:01:36] we'll pause it brother brandham talks
[1:01:40] about we're going to read it here in
[1:01:41] just a little bit about how that you
[1:01:44] know historically they were the Jews
[1:01:47] were expecting a great political leader
[1:01:49] a great warrior a great Champion a great
[1:01:52] Soldier a great military General to come
[1:01:54] in and and give them back their autonomy
[1:01:57] reestablish them as a nation kick the
[1:01:59] Romans out and be able to reestablish a
[1:02:02] theocracy there uh in in Israel and
[1:02:05] brother bam didn't pull that out of thin
[1:02:07] air he people don't realize yeah he he
[1:02:09] only had a seventh grade education you
[1:02:12] know perfectly speaking but brother
[1:02:14] brandham if you ever seen his library
[1:02:15] and I have a list of all the books he
[1:02:17] read he has all the classics all the
[1:02:19] history and he read them all and he read
[1:02:21] a lot he was a very well- read man and
[1:02:24] and it didn't even take me just that
[1:02:26] long I didn't it didn't take me minutes
[1:02:27] to to figure out wonder where he got
[1:02:30] this claim that they were looking for a
[1:02:32] general and they were looking for a
[1:02:34] political leader but Alfred idim writes
[1:02:37] about it in The Life and Times of Jesus
[1:02:39] the Messiah Joseph clausner writes about
[1:02:41] it in the Messianic idea in Israel uh
[1:02:44] Julius Scott Jr writes about it in the
[1:02:46] Jewish background of the New Testament
[1:02:48] and but instead of a great political
[1:02:50] leader God did the unexpected they were
[1:02:55] expect in a great political military
[1:02:58] leader but God did the
[1:03:00] unexpected he humbled them by sending
[1:03:04] them a baby in a Manger instead amen now
[1:03:09] so so let's let's just talk let's just
[1:03:11] talk about some more sudden shocking
[1:03:13] astonishing moments we find that the
[1:03:17] Shepherds there in Luke's gospel when
[1:03:19] they were in the fields feeding their
[1:03:21] sheep and suddenly the angel of the Lord
[1:03:24] appears and and announces the birth of
[1:03:26] Christ and within moments a heavenly
[1:03:28] host of angels are suddenly everything
[1:03:30] lights up and there's a whole chorus of
[1:03:33] angels praising God and worshiping God
[1:03:36] and they're saying oh we bring Good
[1:03:37] Tidings of good news where we get the
[1:03:39] song Noel see it mean it's a it's a
[1:03:41] Latin word meaning there's been a birth
[1:03:44] see the savior is born and he's in
[1:03:46] Bethlehem and and this was this was
[1:03:50] astonishing uh to to these Shepherds
[1:03:52] they were astonished now because it had
[1:03:54] never happened
[1:03:56] before and all the chronicles of their
[1:03:59] history among all their Heroes I mean
[1:04:01] going all the way back to Abraham and
[1:04:03] even Beyond now Angelic visitations of
[1:04:06] course had not were not new but
[1:04:09] announcing the birth of
[1:04:12] Messiah wait what see so so that you
[1:04:18] know th this was this was you know
[1:04:20] because Abraham I mean we we we read
[1:04:23] about job that job had seen a redeemer
[1:04:28] amen you say those Shepherds should have
[1:04:30] known yeah they should have been
[1:04:32] expecting him because he had been
[1:04:36] prophesied job saw him Abraham had been
[1:04:38] told going all the way back to Abraham
[1:04:41] they knew that Abraham had been made a
[1:04:43] promise that your seed Not
[1:04:46] seeds seed singular Christ seed the word
[1:04:52] seed amen will produce a kingdom that
[1:04:56] that will be will outnumber the sand
[1:04:58] grains of all seash shores that this
[1:05:02] seed will bring forth a kingdom of
[1:05:05] saints that will outnumber the stars of
[1:05:08] heaven and they don't even know how many
[1:05:11] stars there are they they know there's
[1:05:12] more galaxies than there are grains of
[1:05:15] sand on all the beaches over all the
[1:05:18] Earth that's what they can see and then
[1:05:20] they they don't even know what they
[1:05:22] don't know yeah and so here
[1:05:26] Abraham has made this promise you would
[1:05:28] think that it wouldn't shock anybody
[1:05:30] that when it got announced yeah it was
[1:05:32] sudden but everybody should have just
[1:05:33] was said wow okay everything we've been
[1:05:37] waiting for I'm here to tell you
[1:05:38] something friends for 2,000 years the
[1:05:41] Christian church has waited for the
[1:05:42] Rapture and what the world is missing is
[1:05:45] it's already
[1:05:46] started and it's already in process and
[1:05:50] you talk about something shocking when
[1:05:52] you say that to people so this is not
[1:05:55] not just another announcement because
[1:05:58] like all prophecies announcing his
[1:06:00] coming these Angels were not announcing
[1:06:04] he's coming the angel of the Lord came
[1:06:08] to them to say I'm not here to tell you
[1:06:10] he's coming I'm here to tell you he's
[1:06:14] here that's exactly what he did at his
[1:06:16] second coming a prophet steps up and he
[1:06:18] says my Ministry is not to tell you he's
[1:06:21] coming the church has known that for
[1:06:23] 2,000 years I'm here to tell you he's
[1:06:25] here among
[1:06:28] us see so you know that should certainly
[1:06:32] speak to us as it relates to the
[1:06:34] ministry of William brandom that was
[1:06:37] constantly that he's not coming that
[1:06:40] he's here and what's what's a what's you
[1:06:43] know more ironic to me is that he would
[1:06:46] he would come to the end of a prayer
[1:06:48] line and this happened thousands and
[1:06:53] thousands of times
[1:06:56] you can hear 1,00 times just listing to
[1:06:59] tapes when brother brandham is going to
[1:07:00] start the prayer line and he's just
[1:07:03] talking away he'll say you know what I'm
[1:07:04] waiting for and then suddenly brother
[1:07:06] Brandon would say okay he's
[1:07:08] here I mean who had the audacity and the
[1:07:12] authority but not only could William
[1:07:14] brandham say he's here he could prove
[1:07:18] it and he proved it over and over and
[1:07:21] over and over and over and over did I
[1:07:24] say over over that's a lot of times and
[1:07:27] over more and more and more and more and
[1:07:29] he proved it around the world thousands
[1:07:31] of times said now he's here I take every
[1:07:34] Spirit under my control for the glory of
[1:07:36] God I'm here to tell you friends that
[1:07:38] one that came here has never left here a
[1:07:42] prophet went home but now he's here to
[1:07:45] to to be enthroned in your heart so that
[1:07:47] you can now take authority over every
[1:07:50] evil spirit for the glory of God you can
[1:07:53] take authority in your home in your life
[1:07:56] among your children don't unell what
[1:07:59] God's presence means to you in this
[1:08:02] moment of
[1:08:06] time so he taught us that his ministry
[1:08:10] was not merely to say he's coming but
[1:08:14] he's here Herod also when he received
[1:08:19] the announcement of the wise men two
[1:08:21] years later saying that Messiah is
[1:08:25] already born in the earth he's already
[1:08:27] here and you know he seemed shocked he
[1:08:30] seemed
[1:08:31] confused the all of his wise men he
[1:08:34] starts asking around and they're all
[1:08:35] running around they're all in confusion
[1:08:37] they they they the the sudden
[1:08:39] realization appears to have shocked and
[1:08:41] Confused everyone amen think of the
[1:08:45] runup now think of the runup and I'm I
[1:08:47] I'm going to try not to get too deeply
[1:08:50] in the in the details because I'm not
[1:08:52] really trying to correlate I just want
[1:08:54] to say that I'm not trying to perfectly
[1:08:56] correlate every type in Shadow here I'm
[1:08:58] just going to speak generally you
[1:09:01] good because the runup to Messiah you
[1:09:04] had all of these prophets coming on the
[1:09:06] scene and they're all talking about from
[1:09:09] the time of Abraham on and every time a
[1:09:11] prophet's coming he's got Messianic
[1:09:13] prophecies and the Old Testament is
[1:09:15] filled with Messianic promises about
[1:09:18] Messiah about he's coming he's going to
[1:09:20] be here and then Malachi comes and says
[1:09:22] the one whom you seek yeah we're all
[1:09:24] been seeking him since the days of
[1:09:26] Abraham well guess what he'll suddenly
[1:09:28] come to his
[1:09:29] Temple okay
[1:09:33] great where's he at man it's been an
[1:09:36] hour it was going to be 400
[1:09:39] years it's going to be a lot of hours a
[1:09:41] lot of generations were going to be
[1:09:43] going like that
[1:09:45] wow see so so you think of the of the
[1:09:50] runup to
[1:09:52] Messiah and then and then what do you
[1:09:54] get a long protracted
[1:09:58] lull like nothing's really happening
[1:10:01] Lots was
[1:10:02] happening but it didn't it it it looked
[1:10:05] like a l we're we can feel that way
[1:10:08] today we can we can say man seals were
[1:10:11] open we know that that couldn't have
[1:10:13] come to the ministry of the son of man
[1:10:14] we know the ministry of the son of man
[1:10:15] was the sign of mezc that was the last
[1:10:17] sign the world would see before the
[1:10:19] bride goes home that's not an opinion of
[1:10:21] a man or my opinion your opinion that's
[1:10:23] scriptural prophecy laid out clearly
[1:10:25] see and so so but yet here we still are
[1:10:29] more than half a century later see and
[1:10:32] so but we're and and really all we have
[1:10:34] to go by is constantly we hear you know
[1:10:37] Peter saying hold on don't think that
[1:10:39] the Lord is late late to the party he's
[1:10:42] just very gracious trying to get
[1:10:44] everybody in that he can he's got to
[1:10:45] find all those names on the on the
[1:10:47] Lamb's Book of Life some of them weren't
[1:10:48] even born when the seals were opened
[1:10:51] amen amen I wasn't born when the seals
[1:10:54] were opened I was born months later and
[1:10:56] so so they had to and and and you I've
[1:10:59] had children and my children have had
[1:11:01] children and the generations are coming
[1:11:02] up now I'm here to tell you there is a
[1:11:05] last generation and I believe it's on
[1:11:08] the earth now there are two prophets to
[1:11:10] go to Israel and I believe they're on
[1:11:11] the earth now there is a message and
[1:11:14] it's here now Hallelujah the presence of
[1:11:17] Christ is here now Glory a table is
[1:11:20] being prepared
[1:11:22] now the world is falling apart and
[1:11:24] that's happening at Breakneck speed say
[1:11:27] could it go on another 100 Years brother
[1:11:29] brandham answered that he said it could
[1:11:30] go on another 100 years but I that was
[1:11:32] from his day I would just tell you if
[1:11:33] you ask me that question today I would
[1:11:35] just have this simple answer I don't see
[1:11:37] how the Earth could survive another
[1:11:39] hundred years there it's so insane and
[1:11:42] and everything on a hair trigger right
[1:11:44] now you remember we just show preached a
[1:11:47] sermon where we were showing you nuclear
[1:11:49] proliferation and and and and all it
[1:11:51] takes is one madman that's just one see
[1:11:55] and so you think the world might have a
[1:11:57] few Mad
[1:11:59] Men has there ever been a day like this
[1:12:01] day with Mad Men
[1:12:04] see so you think about the runup to
[1:12:07] Messiah and then suddenly there's a law
[1:12:10] you know and and and even and I think
[1:12:12] it's John who says you know he'll come
[1:12:14] and he won't
[1:12:16] tar John it's been 2,000 years since you
[1:12:19] said that
[1:12:20] buddy so then where's the mind of God
[1:12:23] versus your mind cuz God not lying and
[1:12:26] his Apostles not lying see and and I
[1:12:30] realized that really it's perfect
[1:12:33] because when when brother brandham says
[1:12:35] you know you you say this and you say
[1:12:38] it's wrong he says you'll find out one
[1:12:40] day when California is laying beneath
[1:12:42] the ocean out there and Hollywood is
[1:12:43] sunk down that that's going to come
[1:12:46] suddenly see yeah that's going to shock
[1:12:49] you're talking about a shock to the
[1:12:51] world we did that the numbers on it
[1:12:52] you're talking about it's not it's not
[1:12:54] catastroph Ric it's cataclysmic it's
[1:12:56] almost off the
[1:12:58] scale and and so we find out that you
[1:13:00] have this run up then there's this law
[1:13:03] then a Revival breaks out after a long
[1:13:05] LW John is baptizing saying the Kingdom
[1:13:08] of Heaven is coming and there's one
[1:13:10] among you now now I don't know who he is
[1:13:12] yet amen but I was told what to look for
[1:13:16] see but I know here's my here's the
[1:13:19] message of Elijah he's here now among
[1:13:23] you see and so then suddenly suddenly
[1:13:29] suddenly like every other day at the
[1:13:31] Jordan John's been baptizing people for
[1:13:33] months now and suddenly here's another
[1:13:36] day that just looks like another day oh
[1:13:40] one of those other another days is going
[1:13:42] to come for you and I friend and
[1:13:44] suddenly John comes up and he looks into
[1:13:46] the crowd and here comes Jesus pressing
[1:13:49] through he wasn't born right then he'd
[1:13:51] been born for 30 years and suddenly he
[1:13:54] presses through the CR out and John goes
[1:13:55] there he is that's the one of whom I
[1:13:58] told you that he who's coming after me
[1:14:01] I'm not worthy to lose his you who is he
[1:14:03] John be clear it's the Lamb of
[1:14:06] God no ambiguity that's what a prophet
[1:14:09] would say he's not a denominational
[1:14:11] system he's the word he clearly
[1:14:14] identified him by the word and this is
[1:14:16] what the word say how do you know that
[1:14:18] it's Christ influencing my life if your
[1:14:21] life matches this then it's a a foregone
[1:14:24] conclusion because this is Christ in
[1:14:27] letter
[1:14:28] form amen so
[1:14:31] suddenly the Lamb of
[1:14:33] God the Messiah I've been telling you
[1:14:36] about he's
[1:14:38] here John 1:15 I don't have it on my
[1:14:41] slide says John bear witness of him and
[1:14:43] cried saying this was he of whom I spake
[1:14:46] he that cometh after me is preferred
[1:14:48] before me for he was before me imagine a
[1:14:51] human looking at another human and and
[1:14:54] the birth record records at the hospital
[1:14:57] showed this was a
[1:15:01] lie John said he was before me hold on
[1:15:04] John we went and found the records of
[1:15:06] the hospital apparently you don't know
[1:15:07] when you were
[1:15:09] born see so God's prophets are all the
[1:15:13] time misunderstood like that amen so
[1:15:16] when the presence of the Lord you know
[1:15:19] and the spirit of Elijah would come
[1:15:21] again today he would often say the very
[1:15:24] same thing Behold the Lamb of God he's
[1:15:26] here and he can prove it but just you
[1:15:28] remember that when he in when the spirit
[1:15:31] said pick up your pen and write it would
[1:15:34] not he actually said that the the the
[1:15:37] the the duty of the prophet of this day
[1:15:39] was to point out the word born bride to
[1:15:42] identify her clearly that she because
[1:15:46] there's 33,000 different
[1:15:49] versions of of everyone saying we're the
[1:15:51] bride and it took a prophet with
[1:15:53] prophetic insight to show who the real
[1:15:56] bride is see and this is the part of the
[1:15:59] word of God Brother JD was talking about
[1:16:01] this in his last sermon on Wednesday so
[1:16:03] brilliant because you have to realize
[1:16:06] that that there's all kinds of listen
[1:16:08] friends this will help you there's all
[1:16:09] kinds of parts in the word of God that a
[1:16:11] student can sit down they did this in
[1:16:13] the man age yeah amen and a student can
[1:16:16] compare verse with verse and there's a
[1:16:18] lot of stuff that they can eek out and
[1:16:20] pull out and it's actually accurate it's
[1:16:22] actually not even close to Accurate it's
[1:16:23] actually perfectly accurate
[1:16:25] see and and but yet we find that there's
[1:16:28] parts of the mystery of redemption the
[1:16:32] mystery of redemption as a whole is not
[1:16:35] you can't do it that way it requires the
[1:16:37] teaching of the Holy Ghost it requires a
[1:16:39] new birth brother Bram said it won't it
[1:16:42] can't just take a student comparing
[1:16:45] verse with verse it's going to take
[1:16:47] somebody with prophetic Insight who's
[1:16:49] not a student but he is a a conduit he
[1:16:52] is a microphone that God can speak
[1:16:53] through and and reveal the mystery of
[1:16:56] redemption cuz that's locked away no one
[1:16:59] can understand the mystery of redemption
[1:17:02] until the spirit makes it plain to them
[1:17:05] amen amen
[1:17:07] see so people who say we don't need a
[1:17:10] prophet in this day they just don't know
[1:17:12] what they're talking about even if we
[1:17:15] and Brandon was prophet there has to be
[1:17:17] one
[1:17:19] see so so you know
[1:17:23] um so as we were saying as as related to
[1:17:27] the Fulfillment of Malachi 3:1 although
[1:17:30] the Jews by this and many other
[1:17:32] prophecies they knew that Messiah would
[1:17:34] come and yet they were surprised at his
[1:17:37] sudden appearance on the scene moreover
[1:17:40] the the the reality of the form he took
[1:17:44] shocked them um because they said wait a
[1:17:48] minute yeah we we got a lot of
[1:17:50] confidence in John but Jesus of Nazareth
[1:17:54] you understand say we saw him raised as
[1:17:56] a boy we know his dad his mom his
[1:18:00] brothers his sisters we watched him
[1:18:02] playing in the streets you know as a
[1:18:04] teenager he was over at my house hanging
[1:18:06] out with my
[1:18:07] kids and you're saying this is the Lamb
[1:18:10] of God this boy we grew up around that
[1:18:13] was exactly right and to disbelieve it
[1:18:15] was a death sentence see so so as far as
[1:18:20] being the Messiah he was nothing like
[1:18:22] they expected they they expected you
[1:18:24] know God to drop down a conveyor and the
[1:18:27] Son of God would just come down he'd be
[1:18:28] a great General so then and then all
[1:18:31] right now now let's let's look it
[1:18:33] further let's just follow it along for a
[1:18:34] minute again I'm not trying to uh dot
[1:18:37] every eye and cross every tea as far as
[1:18:39] applying types to what we saw in history
[1:18:41] I'm just speaking generally because it
[1:18:43] wasn't long after that that John was
[1:18:45] taken off the scene rather gruesomely to
[1:18:48] everyone's shock and dismay and then it
[1:18:50] went on to Jesus and then he shook the
[1:18:53] world with his ministry and then and lo
[1:18:55] and behold he gets killed and he's dead
[1:18:59] and he's in a
[1:19:00] tomb
[1:19:03] mindblowing
[1:19:04] what amen I mean you we'll talk about it
[1:19:07] in places I mean it was so
[1:19:10] discouraging Peter just said Peter what
[1:19:12] are you gonna do I don't know what do
[1:19:15] you think about all this you know what
[1:19:17] I'm just going
[1:19:18] fishing I'm just going back to what I
[1:19:20] know I cannot explain why he's dead I
[1:19:24] cannot explain why he's in a tomb I
[1:19:26] cannot explain why the devil apparently
[1:19:28] won I thought he would be a king I
[1:19:30] thought this was it we thought it was
[1:19:32] the restoration that's not that's not
[1:19:35] that's not that's not no it's nothing
[1:19:37] like we thought he came on the scene and
[1:19:39] astonished us he left the same
[1:19:42] way you know amen is that Bible Jesus
[1:19:46] meets them on those walking on the road
[1:19:48] to EMAs and they're all downcast and he
[1:19:50] says why are you downcast they said 'w
[1:19:52] you what are you a stranger' you don't
[1:19:54] read the news you the the of Jesus of
[1:19:58] Nazareth what about him well we thought
[1:20:00] he would be the king of Israel and now
[1:20:01] they killed him and it's been three days
[1:20:04] he's by this time he's stinking and
[1:20:06] there's some crazy cooky women who said
[1:20:09] they saw him well how ridiculous is that
[1:20:13] see God does the
[1:20:16] unexpected in unexplainable
[1:20:19] ways see so he he appeared to them in
[1:20:23] the room and at first first when he just
[1:20:25] walked in and there the the 11 the 11
[1:20:27] disciples who are remaining out of all
[1:20:29] of his big church he had hundreds and
[1:20:31] hundreds and everybody flocked to him
[1:20:33] and and he he's got thousands and now
[1:20:36] he's down to 11 troops and they're
[1:20:38] sitting in a room and suddenly he
[1:20:40] doesn't open a door he doesn't crawl
[1:20:41] through a window he just walks through
[1:20:42] the wall and it appears
[1:20:44] suddenly and at first they can't speak
[1:20:47] because of fear amen and then when he
[1:20:50] preat some food and proves to him it's
[1:20:52] him then suddenly they can't speak for
[1:20:54] joy
[1:20:55] see so so the whole thing is that it was
[1:20:58] so sudden and it was so unexpected now
[1:21:02] it shouldn't have been right because he
[1:21:05] told them this is what I'll do this is
[1:21:08] exactly what will happen and so they're
[1:21:10] you know they're they're back to fishing
[1:21:12] again and and they're in the boat and
[1:21:14] Peter and John and they're fishing and
[1:21:16] the next thing you know Jesus suddenly
[1:21:18] appears on the
[1:21:20] shore wow children have you any meat
[1:21:23] who's that old guy
[1:21:26] and John's looking wait a
[1:21:28] minute that's the Lord Peter rips off
[1:21:31] his tunic Dives in half-dressed swim he
[1:21:34] can't even wait on the boat he swims all
[1:21:37] the way to the
[1:21:38] shore I mean this was sudden this was
[1:21:41] unexpected this was UN
[1:21:43] inexplicable and yet this is how God
[1:21:46] operates he he you know they they come
[1:21:49] to the to the Mount of Olives and they
[1:21:52] my goodness they pepper him with
[1:21:53] questions you know when shall these
[1:21:55] things be and when will there won't be
[1:21:57] one stone and is this the you know are
[1:21:59] you going to now restore the kingdom he
[1:22:00] comes there on the Mount of Olives as
[1:22:02] he's get ready to to sin will you now
[1:22:03] restore the kingdom and you know um some
[1:22:08] of the questions he'll answer uh some of
[1:22:10] them he he won't answer some of them he
[1:22:13] can't answer see CU he doesn't know yet
[1:22:16] he's going to get a revelation uh later
[1:22:18] and that's why John's going to be put on
[1:22:21] patmas and so so we find that but but he
[1:22:25] did have some instructions oh yeah he
[1:22:28] did say to them here's what you need to
[1:22:30] do don't worry about when the kingdom is
[1:22:33] coming the father has I promise you the
[1:22:36] father's got this I know it doesn't look
[1:22:40] good I know there was a big lull and
[1:22:41] then there was John and then he was gone
[1:22:43] and then I was here and then I was gone
[1:22:44] and then the tomb and I and and I
[1:22:47] appeared in the room and I talked to the
[1:22:48] GU on Aus Mary didn't recognize me and
[1:22:50] you're trying to ask me now is the
[1:22:52] kingdom no it's actually not but here's
[1:22:54] here here's what I here's what I can
[1:22:55] tell you go and be ued T in the cityall
[1:23:00] until how long until now it's going to
[1:23:03] turn out to be 10 days because at this
[1:23:05] point it's 40 days and it's got to be 10
[1:23:07] more days for the Pentecostal Feast out
[1:23:09] of the Old Testament in The Book of
[1:23:10] Leviticus but he says go and and Terry
[1:23:14] and he didn't tell them 10 days he just
[1:23:17] said until I'm here to tell you when God
[1:23:20] gives you a vague order he knows how
[1:23:23] long it's going to last
[1:23:25] he knows what's going to happen just do
[1:23:28] it don't question him just go do it how
[1:23:32] long Lord how long we wait what do we do
[1:23:34] what you know which just go do it just
[1:23:36] go t until because the power is coming
[1:23:40] but that power that was to come was not
[1:23:43] only already known of God it was already
[1:23:45] it was a a perfect point that the Lord
[1:23:47] knew I'm here to tell you when is the
[1:23:49] rapture coming exactly when the Lord
[1:23:51] knows it's time when are we going to see
[1:23:54] our loved ones not one minute past that
[1:23:57] time Hallelujah friends when are we
[1:23:59] going to be at a marriage supper of the
[1:24:01] Lamb I don't know but I know we won't be
[1:24:04] late hallelujah how long's this trial
[1:24:06] going to last I don't know but he's got
[1:24:08] it how long will I suffer I don't know I
[1:24:11] can't say but I know by his stripes you
[1:24:14] can claim healing I know that you can
[1:24:16] have faith for your family I know
[1:24:18] they're out there I know what this has
[1:24:20] been happening I'm here to tell you God
[1:24:22] knows all about it Hallelujah it doesn't
[1:24:25] matter if it's a la or it's unexpected
[1:24:27] or it comes in a different way your
[1:24:29] trust is to be in his word hallelujah
[1:24:33] and he gave us a word to be
[1:24:35] trusted do you believe he's earned your
[1:24:38] trust third of you do you believe Jesus
[1:24:42] has earned your
[1:24:44] trust certainly has earned
[1:24:48] mine see so a power is coming on you and
[1:24:54] you'll be a witness of
[1:24:56] me from this
[1:25:00] Jerusalem then it'll be out into Judea
[1:25:03] and then you like a concentric ring then
[1:25:05] you'll go all the way out to Samaria and
[1:25:07] then you'll go to the uttermost part of
[1:25:09] the earth see so from Jerusalem to all
[1:25:12] the
[1:25:14] world all the world
[1:25:16] H all the world
[1:25:19] so we're not going in the Rapture right
[1:25:23] yet
[1:25:26] when this gospel has went into all the
[1:25:28] world then the end shall
[1:25:32] come then they came to 10 long days of
[1:25:36] questions and lot more
[1:25:39] bewilderment why am I brother Jason
[1:25:41] what's why are you preaching on this
[1:25:43] today because we suffer a lot of the
[1:25:45] same bewilderment what's going on what's
[1:25:47] Happening why are we still here the
[1:25:49] world's crazy we can't take it Lord's
[1:25:52] left us here too long what's up
[1:25:54] see I'm here to tell you it's all
[1:25:58] perfectly harmoniously synchronized
[1:26:01] choreographed under God's control in
[1:26:04] God's hands by God's power see you I
[1:26:08] mean if you don't believe that then how
[1:26:11] did you get born again I promise you you
[1:26:14] couldn't have done it to
[1:26:15] yourself amen there had to be a time and
[1:26:19] a place when you were running but
[1:26:21] somebody could run faster Hallelujah and
[1:26:24] somebody tripped you from behind you
[1:26:26] were trying to get away you might be
[1:26:28] trying to get away today I'm here to
[1:26:30] tell you he can outr run you he can out
[1:26:32] weigh you he can put you on the ground
[1:26:34] Jacob found that out wrestling the angel
[1:26:37] I'm here to tell you I would just say
[1:26:39] surrender surrender
[1:26:42] surrender
[1:26:44] see so you know brother Brandon talks
[1:26:47] about that you know there's so much
[1:26:49] bewilderment and controversies about
[1:26:51] what do we do and you know brother
[1:26:53] Brandon picks up The Narrative there and
[1:26:54] he says you know some of them said you
[1:26:56] know you know you know you know Simon i
[1:26:58] u i feel something man I I just think we
[1:27:01] must already have it and we've been here
[1:27:02] like four and a half days how long we
[1:27:05] supposed to you know nobody God's not we
[1:27:07] got God's
[1:27:08] reasonable God's not going to expect us
[1:27:10] to stay here for five days come on I I
[1:27:13] did you hey did you feel something the
[1:27:14] other night yeah I felt a little funny
[1:27:16] feeling and and I was thinking about the
[1:27:17] word and something kind of started
[1:27:19] happening in that we must have it let's
[1:27:20] go boys come
[1:27:22] on and
[1:27:25] 500 who seen him go by the time I don't
[1:27:28] know what happened to him Bible doesn't
[1:27:30] tell us all I know is by day 10 only 120
[1:27:33] are left yes amen only 120 didn't run
[1:27:36] off here and run off there but 120
[1:27:39] stayed with what he said stay until you
[1:27:42] be endued with power hallelujah it's no
[1:27:45] time to run run for the for the exits
[1:27:48] friends that's not the time our
[1:27:50] Redemption draw us nigh we're almost
[1:27:52] home
[1:27:54] oh
[1:27:55] Hallelujah so then and then the Bible
[1:27:58] says then
[1:28:00] suddenly there came a rushing Mighty
[1:28:03] Wind so I'm not trying to explain every
[1:28:05] detail I'm not trying to correlate every
[1:28:07] event with minute Precision I'm only
[1:28:09] attempting to show you that God does the
[1:28:12] unexpected and he does it in unex it's
[1:28:14] not just the unexpected but when he
[1:28:16] actually does it it's an unexplainable
[1:28:19] ways amen see so as to the end time
[1:28:22] sequence of events how they unfold I
[1:28:26] often encounter people in this day in
[1:28:30] bewilderment and questions you know
[1:28:32] we're still here you know uh well but we
[1:28:36] didn't expect to
[1:28:38] be you know Prophet was saying this and
[1:28:40] a prophet's saying that and I look for
[1:28:42] him every morning and there's nothing
[1:28:43] left for the church I'm not looking for
[1:28:45] Revival I'm looking for the coming he
[1:28:47] said he's right among you now it's the
[1:28:49] kingdom coming so many different things
[1:28:51] the prophet said watch let's look let's
[1:28:54] look at some of it oops cut it
[1:28:58] off so I can cut it there we go God
[1:29:01] doesn't call now notice that title God
[1:29:04] doesn't call a man to judgment without
[1:29:05] first warning him amen a prophet
[1:29:09] foresees way off he's going to talk
[1:29:11] about Amos here in a minute here's a
[1:29:13] lesson for you about prophets this is
[1:29:14] prophets 101 all right a prophet
[1:29:18] foresees way off see see the things that
[1:29:22] is coming he sees the cup of God's Wrath
[1:29:26] full before it's filled he can say thus
[1:29:29] sayeth the Lord God will destroy this
[1:29:31] city except you
[1:29:32] repent why he's an eagle he rides way up
[1:29:36] yonder sea and he looks way off here and
[1:29:39] he sees that Cup of Wrath poured out
[1:29:41] that's what the prophet's looking at he
[1:29:43] ain't looking what's going on here he's
[1:29:46] looking Yonder he's saying it's coming
[1:29:49] he can go so high till he can see that
[1:29:52] shade
[1:29:54] he said the world will be dark referring
[1:29:56] back to Isaiah darkness and gross
[1:29:58] Darkness he's up high enough the Sun's
[1:30:01] shining now but he sees that shade
[1:30:03] coming and he's saying what he's looking
[1:30:06] at it ain't here yet but it'll sure be
[1:30:09] here the world wasn't totally insane in
[1:30:13] 1964 1965 but a prophet could see it and
[1:30:17] says I'll prophesy to you in the name of
[1:30:19] the Lord the world will go completely
[1:30:22] insane he wasn't talking about there he
[1:30:25] was talking about here he was seeing it
[1:30:28] there which was here and saying it's
[1:30:30] right Among Us now and yet it took more
[1:30:33] than a half a century more than we've
[1:30:36] been here almost 70 years and and I'm
[1:30:38] just only in the last 10 years have we
[1:30:41] seen the madness that defies all human
[1:30:45] logic and explanation defies the science
[1:30:48] itself they're all the time saying trust
[1:30:50] the science I wish they would amen
[1:30:54] everybody wants to trust wants me to
[1:30:55] trust the science until I go to back to
[1:30:57] basic
[1:30:58] biology and then suddenly nobody wants
[1:31:01] to trust the science see so so he he he
[1:31:06] goes on
[1:31:08] watch uh let me see where I'm at you
[1:31:12] good all
[1:31:14] right so he says that's right it's going
[1:31:18] to be here gross Darkness upon the
[1:31:20] people he knows it's coming years away
[1:31:23] yet he sees it Amos that anointed
[1:31:25] prophet of God he saw the darkness and
[1:31:27] the Judgment see he seen Syria come down
[1:31:31] with their chariots and sweep through
[1:31:32] there slaughter them people out he saw
[1:31:35] it coming and the Judgment of God was
[1:31:36] upon them now 50 years before it
[1:31:39] happened but you see being a prophet he
[1:31:42] was lifted up into the spirit and he saw
[1:31:44] it far off he saw the cup full before it
[1:31:48] was filled amen
[1:31:51] see all right so he sees it full before
[1:31:56] it was filled so we agree today we agree
[1:32:01] on the general events of the Rapture of
[1:32:04] the church but how it will be played out
[1:32:08] is the question but here's but here's
[1:32:10] what I do
[1:32:12] see I see a pattern that after Revival
[1:32:17] there can often appear in the Scripture
[1:32:19] A a pattern of lingering law until
[1:32:24] suddenly yes amen it's all running up
[1:32:27] and everybody's going and this thing is
[1:32:28] gety up let's go and all of a sudden
[1:32:32] something happens what wait huh how'd
[1:32:34] that happen and then a long low and then
[1:32:36] and then everybody's like wow man it's
[1:32:38] just never going to happen until
[1:32:40] suddenly brother bham said you're going
[1:32:42] to turn around one of these mornings in
[1:32:44] your kitchen and there's going to be
[1:32:45] standing that parent or that loved one
[1:32:47] that crossed over you'll feel a little
[1:32:48] funny feeling like a little pain last
[1:32:50] pain you'll ever feel I'm here to tell
[1:32:53] you something friends the world is not
[1:32:54] expecting that they're not expecting
[1:32:57] what's going to happen because the Bible
[1:32:59] says that the day is coming like has
[1:33:01] never been you understand and and and so
[1:33:06] there we're going to be gone home and
[1:33:09] then the Wrath and the judgments begin
[1:33:11] to be poured out I mean look how how off
[1:33:14] guard look how surprised and astonished
[1:33:17] Putin was just a couple weeks ago he
[1:33:20] never expected Ukraine to be so
[1:33:22] audacious that they're going to launch a
[1:33:23] now they're actually controlling
[1:33:25] hundreds of miles and cities in Russia
[1:33:28] and they don't know what to do about it
[1:33:29] and he's s trying to scramble armies
[1:33:31] they got to come up with a solution I
[1:33:33] promise you you know that I mean in the
[1:33:35] Middle East everything's on a hair
[1:33:36] trigger amen and it's only going to take
[1:33:39] one madman right brother Bram carries on
[1:33:43] now when he speaks of his vision whether
[1:33:46] it's wrath or whether it's healing it
[1:33:48] may linger but it's got to come to pass
[1:33:51] if he speaks it in the name of the Lord
[1:33:53] see it might be a blessing that he
[1:33:55] speaks for you he might tell you a
[1:33:57] certain thing and you can't see it at
[1:34:01] all right you can't see it at all right
[1:34:05] you say how can it be why it's uh I he
[1:34:09] told me thus sayith the Lord this is
[1:34:11] going to happen and that was going to
[1:34:13] happen and it ain't happened the man is
[1:34:16] wrong now you'll be judg for
[1:34:18] disbelieving it but it's going to happen
[1:34:21] anyhow see it's got to happen happen
[1:34:25] though it linger quoting the scripture
[1:34:27] though it linger the Bible said yet it
[1:34:29] will speak in its season it'll come to
[1:34:32] pass the prophet's only looking off and
[1:34:35] seeing something he's talking about what
[1:34:38] he's looking at he ain't thinking uh he
[1:34:42] ain't thinking about here and what you
[1:34:45] look like now he's looking what it's
[1:34:47] going to be I'm so glad the Lord does
[1:34:50] that I'm so glad the Lord don't don't
[1:34:53] grade me whether I'm Rapture Ready by
[1:34:55] way I look now but I know on that
[1:34:57] morning I'll look different I'll be
[1:34:59] different and then suddenly I will be
[1:35:01] different Hallelujah see so he says and
[1:35:06] when he speaks that if it's in the word
[1:35:09] if it's if it's in the word of the lord
[1:35:11] it's already been spoken there's nothing
[1:35:13] in the world can stop it you see that's
[1:35:16] right only God
[1:35:18] himself notice he says he still good
[1:35:22] yeah notice I haven't even been an hour
[1:35:25] yet so everybody I can feel you starting
[1:35:27] to get tired but just stay with me will
[1:35:29] you do
[1:35:30] it I hope I haven't ruined you to 58
[1:35:32] minute sermons so just stay with me
[1:35:34] today this is this is life and death
[1:35:38] friends notice now we find that when he
[1:35:42] speaks his vision the prophet does now
[1:35:46] sometimes he speaks good things he
[1:35:47] speaks of your healing all right you
[1:35:49] might think it's just can't happen I've
[1:35:52] got I I haven't gotten any better then
[1:35:54] what does that do that just brings the
[1:35:57] Judgment of God upon you that's right
[1:35:59] when he said that you can be healed by
[1:36:01] his stripes and then you disbelieve that
[1:36:03] and you start confessing the opposite of
[1:36:05] that well then you wonder why your
[1:36:07] sickness remains see and so he goes on
[1:36:11] he says here Jesus promised to save you
[1:36:14] if you if you'd believe it if you don't
[1:36:16] believe it it won't happen to you you
[1:36:18] got to accept it you got to believe it
[1:36:21] see and you got to know from where it
[1:36:23] comes from that gives your faith in God
[1:36:26] or your Prophet see you got to believe
[1:36:29] it all right you've got to believe it
[1:36:33] now let me get down through that all
[1:36:34] right
[1:36:37] so that often times is where the crisis
[1:36:42] lies because he he makes a prophecy
[1:36:46] concerning the end time and he says when
[1:36:50] I come how many are looking for him to
[1:36:53] come
[1:36:54] he says will I find
[1:36:57] faith not will I find church members or
[1:37:00] find Christians will I find Faith
[1:37:04] remember that there there' come in the
[1:37:06] last days people who would who would uh
[1:37:10] have a form of godliness but they would
[1:37:13] deny the very power thereof in other
[1:37:15] words the real reality of it because
[1:37:18] because there you know will I find faith
[1:37:20] in other words will I find action and
[1:37:22] will I find power and
[1:37:24] demonstration manifesting in a people
[1:37:27] who are overcoming the deception of the
[1:37:30] age if God comes today is that what he's
[1:37:33] going to find in you say well I've been
[1:37:36] a church member I go to church I do this
[1:37:37] I give bombs I pay I give to the poor I
[1:37:40] pay my ti I sing in a choir I read my
[1:37:42] Bible but but will he find faith is your
[1:37:45] life being lived worthy of the Gospel
[1:37:48] are you
[1:37:50] overcoming will he find Faith amen
[1:37:55] see so because if you notice in the
[1:37:58] scripture here's a pattern for you I've
[1:38:00] not been trying to pull patterns but
[1:38:02] here's a pattern you can look at when
[1:38:05] both times when the ministry of Elijah
[1:38:07] comes at his first coming and the
[1:38:08] ministry of Elijah comes at his second
[1:38:10] coming in both cases the word the next
[1:38:13] event is the word made flesh living in
[1:38:15] humans amen you understand as soon as
[1:38:18] John came as Elijah then Jesus came on
[1:38:20] the scene a prophet comes Elijah comes
[1:38:23] back in the this day and what happens
[1:38:25] the word gets made flesh again in a
[1:38:27] people John went home that didn't stop
[1:38:29] Jesus a prophet in our day went home
[1:38:31] that doesn't stop the bride will he find
[1:38:34] faith in your life be honest answer that
[1:38:37] question to
[1:38:39] yourselves
[1:38:40] see so this word suddenly is a very
[1:38:43] powerful word carries a sense of
[1:38:47] unexpectedness that things happen often
[1:38:49] without warning or Preparation and
[1:38:51] that's the real rub that that's why
[1:38:53] Jesus said make sure you're you're
[1:38:55] careful don't get laxed don't get lazy
[1:38:58] cuz the master will come back and catch
[1:39:00] you unawares you'll suffer many stripes
[1:39:02] for that see so I I feel so sorry for
[1:39:06] people who go the way of the world and
[1:39:08] you and I'm sitting here knowing what's
[1:39:09] going to happen I've done that myself
[1:39:11] and I know what what what is
[1:39:13] inescapable and then suddenly the Lord's
[1:39:16] going to Spring the Trap and they're
[1:39:18] going to get caught in it and they're
[1:39:19] going to realize that they walk that
[1:39:21] path for a little too long and suddenly
[1:39:23] now they got to turn around and all
[1:39:25] kinds of problems are in their wake and
[1:39:28] now they're needing God to help them
[1:39:29] help me with my career help me with my
[1:39:31] finan help me with my children help me
[1:39:33] with my grandchildren help me with my
[1:39:34] church help me with this yeah why didn't
[1:39:36] you just take the way of the word why
[1:39:39] didn't why did you sew seeds of
[1:39:40] discrepancy and then pray for a crop
[1:39:42] failure Hallelujah come on is this right
[1:39:46] see so he so he says you you don't do
[1:39:49] that because he's going to come at an
[1:39:50] unexpected time in an unexpected way
[1:39:53] so so we find that it carries this sense
[1:39:56] of it it it can evoke feelings of
[1:39:58] surprise this word sudden it can invoke
[1:40:00] shock it can even evoke fear I'm just
[1:40:03] reading from from Webster and different
[1:40:06] things Google looking it up and he says
[1:40:09] and and one commentator says but it can
[1:40:11] also signal a positive change a sudden
[1:40:13] burst of good news this word sudden see
[1:40:16] it can be um it can be a a pleasant turn
[1:40:19] of
[1:40:20] events that's an understatement on
[1:40:22] rapture morning amen it's a word that
[1:40:27] catches your attention and it Demands a
[1:40:31] reaction I mean hey if you're downtown
[1:40:34] and you step off a curbed across the
[1:40:36] street and you don't see that car coming
[1:40:38] quick and suddenly you see him you
[1:40:42] better have a
[1:40:44] reaction I promise you you better have a
[1:40:47] reaction you better not stand there and
[1:40:48] go three two one well I guess I better
[1:40:52] you'll get
[1:40:53] well I guess I
[1:40:57] better see so this is why acts two and
[1:41:00] suddenly there came a sound from Heaven
[1:41:03] Malachi 3 and the one whom you seek will
[1:41:06] suddenly come to his Temple so it so in
[1:41:10] in in and here's a here's a commentary
[1:41:13] on Luke's word I told you that that they
[1:41:15] comment on Luke's usage of the word
[1:41:18] sudden because it signals a significant
[1:41:23] God God fueled event the sudden in
[1:41:26] Malachi 3 the sudden coming of the Lord
[1:41:30] to his temple in Acts 2 and two suddenly
[1:41:33] again it serves to emphasize the
[1:41:36] unexpected and the miraculous nature of
[1:41:39] the event in both of these cases in both
[1:41:42] of these scriptures the word suddenly
[1:41:44] carries a sense of
[1:41:46] urgency and
[1:41:49] anticipation so this has happened you
[1:41:52] need to have reaction what we need to do
[1:41:54] whatever you're doing needs to be quick
[1:41:56] whatever it needs to you need to get
[1:41:57] some gumping you need to have some Faith
[1:41:59] you need to get stirred up you need to
[1:42:00] go pray you need to figure out get in
[1:42:03] your Bible go back talk to the Lord
[1:42:05] whatever you do don't just sit in the
[1:42:07] lethargy of leod deia and be
[1:42:10] lukewarm it's going to pass right by you
[1:42:14] Hallelujah I don't intend to let it pass
[1:42:16] by me oh that morning when the trumpet
[1:42:19] of God sounds I expect to go home
[1:42:23] I know it's been a l I understand that
[1:42:25] but I'm expecting the soon sudden coming
[1:42:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ see
[1:42:33] amen can I carry
[1:42:37] on so it reminds us the use of the word
[1:42:41] suddenly reminds us that God works in
[1:42:44] ways that we often cannot predict and
[1:42:47] sometimes cannot fully understand see so
[1:42:51] I mean look let's just let's just take
[1:42:54] this for an
[1:42:55] example the
[1:42:58] world the denominational Christian World
[1:43:01] knew has known for 2,000 years that
[1:43:05] Christ is
[1:43:07] coming is that fair so imagine their
[1:43:11] shock I get it imagine their shock when
[1:43:15] a prophet steps up who they've called a
[1:43:17] prophet he didn't call himself that
[1:43:18] they've called him that they according
[1:43:21] to their testimony it's the greatest
[1:43:23] Supernatural Ministry since the days of
[1:43:25] Jesus that's their words and the that's
[1:43:27] replete I wish they'd print some of that
[1:43:29] on their stupid
[1:43:31] sites all the evidence we actually do
[1:43:33] have not the stupid speculation that
[1:43:36] they aim at but actually all of the
[1:43:39] almost an innumerable amount of Highly
[1:43:42] regarded Christian men who lived back
[1:43:44] there during his time and walked with
[1:43:46] him and said he was the most humble man
[1:43:48] they'd ever seen said that gift was
[1:43:50] never wrong never and tens of thousands
[1:43:52] of times NE they went back to his
[1:43:53] translators who weren't followers of his
[1:43:55] message and they said no he never made a
[1:43:57] mistake that was always perfect always
[1:44:00] perfect see and and and to have that man
[1:44:04] step up and he's gonna he's going to say
[1:44:08] something about the event they've
[1:44:10] expected for 2,000 years the Rapture of
[1:44:13] the church and he comes to the pull pit
[1:44:15] not of his own he said i' have made a
[1:44:17] horrible mistake he came in the room and
[1:44:18] told me and he comes and preaches and
[1:44:20] informs the bride that the Rapture you
[1:44:24] remember that that 2,000 year thing
[1:44:26] we've been waiting on it's already
[1:44:30] started imagine the shock that they wow
[1:44:34] how could a prophet with that kind of
[1:44:35] accuracy be wrong and it's left them in
[1:44:38] a conundrum they they can't dis they
[1:44:41] can't discredit him there's too many
[1:44:42] there's too many thousands of witnesses
[1:44:44] there's too many documents too many
[1:44:45] doctors too many people got in line to
[1:44:48] testify but how are they going to make
[1:44:50] sense of this the Rapture is on yeah
[1:44:52] because it's in a shout that's it's
[1:44:54] actually what you didn't know was Paul
[1:44:56] was saying it's in three
[1:44:58] stages I'm so glad that I see that I'm
[1:45:01] so glad I'm a part of it I'm sorry they
[1:45:04] don't see it but I'm glad I do see it
[1:45:06] and I pray that you'll see it today
[1:45:08] we're not waiting on it to commence it's
[1:45:10] already underway are you a part of it
[1:45:14] he's not coming to find Faith he's
[1:45:16] asking today do you have it in your life
[1:45:21] now in this Serv
[1:45:23] right here where you sit can he see the
[1:45:26] faith in you and say what does it look
[1:45:28] like it looks like the power of God
[1:45:31] overcoming the deception of the age and
[1:45:33] taking a stand for the word of God
[1:45:37] that's what faith looks
[1:45:39] like
[1:45:41] see prise
[1:45:43] God you talk about something
[1:45:47] unexpected I mean have we forgotten that
[1:45:49] have we have we forgotten that has the
[1:45:51] law been
[1:45:53] this many decades long to where we have
[1:45:57] forgotten
[1:45:59] that is that
[1:46:01] possible that the world has went on for
[1:46:05] these decades and I've already proven to
[1:46:06] you that's not
[1:46:08] unusual but we have to ask ourselves the
[1:46:11] question what's going on under my roof
[1:46:14] yes amen what's going on in my heart
[1:46:18] what's going on in my life and in the
[1:46:20] life of my family you you see it's one
[1:46:22] one thing to say I'm a Believer but but
[1:46:25] does your life does the wake coming
[1:46:29] behind your life look like
[1:46:31] Faith amen or has Leo DEA just LED you
[1:46:35] into a a place of
[1:46:38] lethargy my I I wonder sometimes if we I
[1:46:43] wonder sometimes can I just be honest
[1:46:46] now as a pastor I wonder sometimes and I
[1:46:49] wonder about this within my own self now
[1:46:50] I'm not just pointing at you my wife and
[1:46:53] I have this conversation all the time
[1:46:55] you know what happened to so many of the
[1:46:57] old standards that have just been swept
[1:47:01] aside standards for our home standards
[1:47:03] on the way we live standards of our
[1:47:05] church attendance standards for tithes
[1:47:06] and offerings standards for our children
[1:47:08] standards for our teenagers standards
[1:47:10] for all of these all of these ancient
[1:47:12] landmarks and standards have just like
[1:47:13] well they just don't matter they just
[1:47:15] like dulled out almost like grayed out
[1:47:18] you know you're like you're looking at a
[1:47:20] screen and there's a link but it's
[1:47:21] grayed out you can't click it anymore
[1:47:25] and and and I and I just wonder has has
[1:47:28] the has the fact that the Rapture that
[1:47:33] we're not waiting on it it's already
[1:47:36] underway and it's already in the voice
[1:47:39] and the last thing to happen is the dead
[1:47:41] in Christ to rise and maybe California
[1:47:43] first which I think probably maybe on
[1:47:45] the same morning they'll hit Sy
[1:47:47] synchronously but and I can stand here
[1:47:51] but I'm not telling you anything you
[1:47:52] haven't known for for 70 years but has
[1:47:55] it become background
[1:47:59] noise me look you all in the eye has it
[1:48:02] become background
[1:48:04] noise man I'm not going to look you in
[1:48:06] the eye anymore that's too
[1:48:08] serious
[1:48:11] wow because when I'm looking at you I'm
[1:48:13] looking at me you're the product of my
[1:48:16] Ministry so what's up has that fact
[1:48:20] become background noise in our marriages
[1:48:22] in our homes in our teenagers in our
[1:48:25] work in our careers in our prayer life
[1:48:29] and in our T I mean the the list goes on
[1:48:32] and on and on and brother Brandon
[1:48:36] described it as a lowering of the bars
[1:48:39] and sheep are getting out and they're
[1:48:41] grazing in the grasslands of the world
[1:48:43] and say what's so bad about that there's
[1:48:45] poisonous weeds out there the shepherd
[1:48:48] don't have any poisonous weeds in his
[1:48:50] field they're all taken out by the word
[1:48:52] am it ought to concern us see because
[1:48:56] I'm here to tell you you being in a
[1:48:59] state of lethargy ain't going to stop
[1:49:01] the suddenness of it it's going to
[1:49:03] suddenly and and I'm and now and now I'm
[1:49:05] not even talking about the catching away
[1:49:08] you might have tomorrow where something
[1:49:11] happens in your life and it's going to
[1:49:13] it could happen suddenly and you realize
[1:49:16] you need God and you are miles from him
[1:49:20] amen see amen and you suddenly need to
[1:49:24] repent and you suddenly need to pray you
[1:49:26] suddenly need to get me on the phone you
[1:49:28] suddenly need
[1:49:30] help see the Rapture of the church is on
[1:49:34] it's underway right now you talk about
[1:49:36] something ultimately unexplainable to
[1:49:39] someone outside someone without a born
[1:49:41] again experience how you going to
[1:49:43] explain that the Rapture is already on
[1:49:44] you you you can't even hardly put it in
[1:49:46] words now that that that doesn't mean
[1:49:48] you can't explain it in the scripture
[1:49:50] right amen of course you can can explain
[1:49:53] the three phases I can explain the
[1:49:54] coming of the Lord I can tie it back to
[1:49:56] Luke 17 I can tie it to Malachi 4 I can
[1:49:58] tie it to Revelation 10 I can tie it to
[1:49:59] Revelation 18 that's easy to do that's
[1:50:02] just X's and O's you understand that's
[1:50:05] just a spec sheet but but but it's not
[1:50:08] that I can't accurately describe it in
[1:50:10] the scripture it's certainly explainable
[1:50:12] in the scriptures but that doesn't mean
[1:50:15] they will believe you it doesn't mean
[1:50:17] they will see it but to God's family it
[1:50:20] immediately becomes clear the Bible
[1:50:23] becomes a brand new book to you as well
[1:50:27] am I preaching to people who believe
[1:50:28] that today who've experienced it you
[1:50:31] discovered guess what you discovered
[1:50:32] that you're an eaglet you're also part
[1:50:34] of the eagle family also and you hear a
[1:50:37] prophet and you begin to feel lift
[1:50:39] coming up under your wings try to
[1:50:41] explain that to someone try to explain
[1:50:44] that you you begin to get a sense of
[1:50:46] altitude you realize I'm not in that
[1:50:48] barnyard of the world anymore somehow I
[1:50:51] got up here in the upper Stratosphere
[1:50:54] you can't put that in the language it's
[1:50:56] Faith it's in your
[1:50:59] life oh you discover you begin to get
[1:51:02] this sense of it see I'm not I'm not I'm
[1:51:05] not trying to put this feeling into
[1:51:07] words to you but a fellow you know what
[1:51:11] a fellow
[1:51:12] Eagle he don't really need my words
[1:51:15] you're already there you already know
[1:51:18] what I'm talking about it's already a
[1:51:20] living reality to you that words cannot
[1:51:23] explain Hallelujah when you open your
[1:51:25] Bible when you turn on a tape you feel
[1:51:27] yourself lifting up into another
[1:51:29] dimension try to put that in in an
[1:51:32] understandable way to explain it to
[1:51:34] somebody that's not something you can
[1:51:36] fully explain easily it's something you
[1:51:38] have to experience it's let me tell you
[1:51:41] it's something the Lord can do for you
[1:51:44] right now in this service say that's
[1:51:47] weird to me that's strange I don't know
[1:51:49] anything about that you can you can and
[1:51:52] you can know about it right now the Holy
[1:51:54] Spirit can suddenly a sound can come
[1:51:57] from heaven and sweep into this building
[1:51:59] and maybe you don't need to hear a sound
[1:52:01] in the building but it's echoing in your
[1:52:04] soul right now and you don't just want
[1:52:05] to say Lord I want to get that altitude
[1:52:08] I want to feel the lift under my
[1:52:11] wings
[1:52:13] hallelujah oh my those in in Jerusalem
[1:52:16] they knew they were supposed to be
[1:52:18] infused with power amen they knew that
[1:52:22] yes Luke's use of the word
[1:52:25] suddenly you know it was it was it was
[1:52:28] saying to the world that something
[1:52:30] incredible has happened to
[1:52:32] us something incredible is the word of
[1:52:35] the hour incredible to you yes see or
[1:52:39] has it lost its
[1:52:42] Savor has it just become background
[1:52:45] noise H have you let the devil lure you
[1:52:47] away because it's been this many decades
[1:52:50] even though that's scriptural
[1:52:52] and and yeah we had all this great power
[1:52:54] we still do there was so much
[1:52:56] Supernatural there still is it's popping
[1:52:59] happens all around us friends the very
[1:53:02] fact that you can still be a believer in
[1:53:04] an impossibly Dark Age is all the power
[1:53:06] you need to get you home I don't need
[1:53:08] God to ever do another thing he don't
[1:53:10] have to heal me he don't have to deliver
[1:53:11] me he don't have to do nothing he
[1:53:12] brought me out of the deep myy clay set
[1:53:15] my feet on a rock to stay hallelujah
[1:53:19] what more power you want people in the
[1:53:21] streets here's what here here what was
[1:53:24] amazing people in the
[1:53:27] streets when they saw those Jews come
[1:53:30] out of that Upper
[1:53:32] Room like
[1:53:34] man what in the
[1:53:36] world we got to we got to have a
[1:53:39] reaction here we need to explain this
[1:53:42] and you know they they they thought
[1:53:44] maybe they were drunk you know it was I
[1:53:48] mean what else could they think it was
[1:53:50] so otherworldly
[1:53:53] it this was so out of the norm they had
[1:53:56] never seen Jews act like that they knew
[1:53:59] it to to sometimes affect prophets that
[1:54:01] way and Prophets would do really strange
[1:54:03] things but here's a whole group of
[1:54:06] people here's a whole church of 120
[1:54:08] people and they're climbing out windows
[1:54:10] and they're falling down the stairs and
[1:54:11] they're out into the street and we heard
[1:54:13] rumors that they were a bunch of
[1:54:15] mechanic filled cowards those rumors
[1:54:17] weren't false but they're not that
[1:54:19] anymore since the sudden rushing might
[1:54:22] wind came in and they're they're they're
[1:54:24] they're trying to put an explanation you
[1:54:27] know but but you know I mean I mean it
[1:54:30] they're trying it's the only thing they
[1:54:31] could think of can I say it that way
[1:54:34] it's we can only correlate there's only
[1:54:36] one thing we can think to correlate what
[1:54:39] we're seeing you guys must be
[1:54:43] drunk uh really third hour of the day
[1:54:47] yeah that's tough yeah it don't make
[1:54:49] sense to us you know you know what
[1:54:52] happened
[1:54:53] that's the way the world looks at it but
[1:54:55] it was it was happening right in front
[1:54:58] of those devout Jews in an
[1:55:02] unexplainable way and you know what it
[1:55:05] took it took Peter anointed of the Holy
[1:55:09] Ghost to reveal what was happening it
[1:55:13] took Peter to go back to Joel's prophecy
[1:55:16] and say you know you remember Joel yeah
[1:55:19] you remember he said that he would pour
[1:55:20] out his Spirit upon All Flesh yeah this
[1:55:23] is it this is that this is what you
[1:55:25] remember on All Flesh and old men would
[1:55:28] dream dreams young men would see Visions
[1:55:30] yeah this is that you mean where the
[1:55:33] handmaidens and everybody gets involved
[1:55:34] and it becomes a whole church and a
[1:55:36] whole Kingdom yeah yeah exactly this is
[1:55:39] that which was spoken of by the prophet
[1:55:41] Joel th th this prophecy they're looking
[1:55:44] at this prophecy and Peter is trying to
[1:55:47] get them to understand that that
[1:55:49] prophecy ain't coming
[1:55:53] it's here
[1:55:55] now it's Among Us now it's happening in
[1:55:59] real
[1:56:01] time brother brandham says and here I
[1:56:03] think maybe it's my uh one of my last
[1:56:07] quotes it's it's short watch brother
[1:56:09] Brenham comes in what is the attraction
[1:56:11] on the
[1:56:13] Mountain Junior Jackson listening in you
[1:56:16] remember the dream he had that I
[1:56:18] interpreted going towards the setting of
[1:56:20] the Sun and this happened sunset
[1:56:22] Mountain it's the evening time sunset
[1:56:25] time the sunset message through a
[1:56:28] setting of history now watch Brother
[1:56:30] Brad um he'll come he'll he'll Circle
[1:56:33] back and and amend his statement see
[1:56:36] because the takeoff is on Sunset
[1:56:38] Mountain so it's a it's a it's it's it's
[1:56:42] that like an sww it happened on Sunset
[1:56:45] mountain and brother brandham says it's
[1:56:48] sunset time the sunset message through a
[1:56:53] setting of history and he amends it a
[1:56:55] setting of Prophecy rather being
[1:56:58] fulfilled see and he goes on all right
[1:57:01] all right so now let let let me let me
[1:57:03] stop
[1:57:04] there want to explain something okay you
[1:57:08] good so he
[1:57:10] says Deb tell him he can preach later
[1:57:13] not right
[1:57:17] now so so brother brandham is coming now
[1:57:20] and I'm I'm just trying to my notes and
[1:57:22] just just give you my heart so he
[1:57:27] says it's a setting of history now he
[1:57:30] didn't say a
[1:57:32] settling of History the holy spirit's
[1:57:35] very specific it's a setting so for
[1:57:38] instance you come to my house and
[1:57:40] there's a table and there's food and
[1:57:42] there's a sink and there's a stove
[1:57:44] what's that setting it's my kitchen you
[1:57:46] go into my living room you won't find a
[1:57:47] stove you won't find a setting food in
[1:57:50] there you'll find chairs and recliners
[1:57:54] and rockers and swivel chairs and rugs
[1:57:57] and picturers and coffee table that's a
[1:57:59] living room you can go into my bedroom
[1:58:01] there's a bed there's a dresser you know
[1:58:03] and you go to my bathroom and you have
[1:58:05] sinks you have shower you have toilet
[1:58:06] you have all these that's the setting so
[1:58:09] he he so he's coming back to say he's
[1:58:11] coming back to say oh it's a setting of
[1:58:14] history no wait because what happened on
[1:58:16] Sunset mountain is not a setting of
[1:58:19] History it's a setting of Prophecy now
[1:58:22] now just go back to acts two because
[1:58:25] that's what Peter is trying to get them
[1:58:27] to do Joel you remember Joel yeah this
[1:58:31] is a setting of Prophecy he's not in
[1:58:34] other words what he's not saying is this
[1:58:36] is a a settling or an accomplishing or a
[1:58:40] it's not a one-off it's not a oneand
[1:58:43] done it's not a settling of history or
[1:58:46] settling of anything it's not even a
[1:58:47] setting of History because it's right
[1:58:50] now and it's not just history it's
[1:58:52] prophecy because it's to you and to your
[1:58:55] children and to them that are far off
[1:58:58] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:59:00] call whenever the Holy Ghost comes it's
[1:59:03] going to act just like this it's a
[1:59:06] setting of Prophecy it's unwinding and
[1:59:08] unwinding and unwinding and it's going
[1:59:09] to unwind for 2,000 years but know this
[1:59:12] that when the restoration of the word
[1:59:14] comes we're going to go back to that
[1:59:16] same experience you say what was the
[1:59:18] experience power came into the people's
[1:59:21] lives Faith to be an overcomer for the
[1:59:25] age the word became flesh so what
[1:59:29] happened on Sunset mountain in the cor
[1:59:31] not of farest 30 miles north of Tucson a
[1:59:33] setting of
[1:59:35] Prophecy a setting of Prophecy in the
[1:59:38] evening time it shall be light the light
[1:59:41] doesn't end when a prophet leaves the
[1:59:43] light travels on to that new day oh
[1:59:46] Hallelujah friends that's where exactly
[1:59:49] where we're at the promise is unto you
[1:59:52] see so again it's God doing the
[1:59:55] unexpected in an unexplainable way but
[1:59:58] it took the Holy Ghost to explain it to
[2:00:02] those
[2:00:02] Jews it took the Holy
[2:00:06] Ghost through Peter to explain it to
[2:00:11] them in a way I mean he calls them
[2:00:17] murderers amen that's pretty tough and
[2:00:21] nobody gets mared
[2:00:22] you can't hardly say anything today you
[2:00:25] you can't even Brother JD and I get it
[2:00:27] I've I've had the same thing happen you
[2:00:29] try to get in the pull pit and you try
[2:00:31] to take a stand on the word of God and
[2:00:33] and teenagers and adults are so
[2:00:35] brainwashed by the poison of the world
[2:00:37] they can't even come back and go wait a
[2:00:39] minute this is biblical standards for
[2:00:40] men and women this is the proper place
[2:00:42] of a woman this proper oh he's
[2:00:44] misogynistic what what happened to the
[2:00:47] old standards of the word I'm here to
[2:00:49] tell you whether you believe them or not
[2:00:51] whether you've been in Ed by leoda the
[2:00:53] word of God stands Eternal and there's a
[2:00:56] place for a man and a place for a woman
[2:00:58] and a place in a home and a way of
[2:01:00] marriage is supposed to work and a way
[2:01:02] that fathers are supposed to be the high
[2:01:04] priest of the
[2:01:05] home and and and here a brother is just
[2:01:08] reading scriptures and he's quoting
[2:01:10] quotes and there's a kickback like oh we
[2:01:12] don't like that I'm here to tell you the
[2:01:14] Holy Spirit stood there on that day and
[2:01:16] preached to Peter and said not only are
[2:01:18] you murderers but you murdered the
[2:01:20] Prince of Life himself
[2:01:22] they didn't get mad it pricked their
[2:01:24] hearts they wanted we got to fix this
[2:01:27] what do we do here's the here's the
[2:01:29] prescription you got to repent and you
[2:01:31] got to be baptized in his name and that
[2:01:35] day there were added thousands to the
[2:01:37] church that's how you get in the church
[2:01:38] you're born into
[2:01:42] it
[2:01:45] amen see he's indicting them for murder
[2:01:48] murdering their own
[2:01:50] Messiah see but to those devout Jews
[2:01:55] they didn't get mad they wanted to fix
[2:01:58] it you
[2:02:00] see no matter no matter how hard the
[2:02:04] word
[2:02:05] comes to the elected amen it sounds like
[2:02:09] Freedom
[2:02:11] right to the elected it sounds like job
[2:02:14] when he said I know my redeemer liveth
[2:02:18] when you accept the word of this day
[2:02:20] that's what makes sense to to you of the
[2:02:23] word amen so I'm I'm coming this is my
[2:02:27] last point I promise this is my last one
[2:02:29] but I want to finish
[2:02:33] it so
[2:02:35] despite so let me let me Shore up now
[2:02:38] give me 60 seconds short up and I'm
[2:02:40] going to come to my last
[2:02:41] Point despite prophecies I'm reading
[2:02:44] back from the definitions and
[2:02:46] expectations surrounding the coming of
[2:02:48] the Messiah and the outpouring of the
[2:02:51] Holy Spirit Spirit Luke's use of the
[2:02:53] word suddenly in these verses suggests
[2:02:57] that there was still an element of
[2:02:59] surprise and unexpectedness when these
[2:03:02] events actually took place this could
[2:03:04] indicate that while people may have had
[2:03:06] some idea of what was coming they could
[2:03:09] not fully anticipate the timing or the
[2:03:11] manner in which these events would
[2:03:13] unfold it reminds us that God often
[2:03:17] Works in ways that are beyond our
[2:03:20] understanding and our
[2:03:23] expectations so even when we think we uh
[2:03:26] we know what's coming we can still be
[2:03:29] taken back by the suddenness and all
[2:03:32] inspiring nature of God you
[2:03:35] agree now here's here's my here's my
[2:03:37] last thing on my
[2:03:39] notes brother brandham comes to the
[2:03:41] world falling
[2:03:43] apart and he says so the whole world
[2:03:46] then was falling apart like it is today
[2:03:49] every nation was looking for someone to
[2:03:52] hold them out of this tragedy that was
[2:03:54] about to strike the world and trying to
[2:03:56] hold them together the nations were
[2:03:58] looking for something and each nation
[2:04:00] was looking for it but they looked like
[2:04:03] they didn't want to accept what God sent
[2:04:05] them see now talking about the Jews they
[2:04:07] were looking for a general they're
[2:04:09] looking for uh a political somebody with
[2:04:12] power to kick the Romans out and set
[2:04:13] them make them an autonomous Nation
[2:04:15] again amen see so so God sends him a
[2:04:19] baby all right now watch they didn't
[2:04:23] they they look like they didn't want to
[2:04:26] accept what God sent
[2:04:28] them they were asking for a man a
[2:04:31] messiah that would stomp out the rest of
[2:04:34] the Nations and God give them a baby
[2:04:37] asking for a general and got a baby God
[2:04:40] knowed what they had need of he
[2:04:44] humiliated them amen I want you to just
[2:04:48] think about that word for a minute he
[2:04:50] humiliated
[2:04:52] them that's the way God does he
[2:04:56] humiliates us when we think we know
[2:04:59] something like he said to Job you so got
[2:05:03] so much wisdom where was you when I laid
[2:05:05] the foundations of the world when the
[2:05:07] morning Stars sang together and sons of
[2:05:08] God shouted for Joy where was you job
[2:05:11] why his wisdom was done see God
[2:05:14] performed his wisdom in dealing with job
[2:05:16] dealing with job
[2:05:18] now we find out that the world wants
[2:05:21] their own Messiah Russia wants theirs
[2:05:24] United States wants theirs the church
[2:05:27] World wants theirs each one wants their
[2:05:29] own Messiah but they want it in a way
[2:05:32] that they can control
[2:05:34] it see they want to have see that's the
[2:05:38] same as saying I want to be a Christian
[2:05:40] but I don't want to be told what to do
[2:05:43] see they want to have control over this
[2:05:46] Messiah oh sure yeah if they if they
[2:05:49] could have see if God would send it in
[2:05:54] their own taste they certainly would
[2:05:56] accept it but you see then God knew
[2:05:59] their
[2:06:00] needs he's not promised to send us our
[2:06:03] wants and what we ask for but our needs
[2:06:07] they wanted a
[2:06:09] general they got a baby see that's what
[2:06:14] they needed everybody say that's what
[2:06:16] they needed that's what they needed they
[2:06:18] needed a baby what to hum humiliate them
[2:06:23] to Humble them that's what the self-
[2:06:26] style church needs today humble itself
[2:06:30] back again see now he's I I I switched
[2:06:34] to the world is again falling apart I
[2:06:35] didn't tell you we switched to a one
[2:06:37] they're about six months apart God to a
[2:06:40] place there is no confession and there's
[2:06:42] no love among the people it seems like
[2:06:44] it's a dying daily church is cooling off
[2:06:46] everywhere you find the Revival is over
[2:06:48] and you find a cooling off we need a
[2:06:52] humiliating amen amen we need what do we
[2:06:57] need yeah not asking you what you want
[2:07:00] I'm asking you what do you think you
[2:07:02] need see now it's interesting and that's
[2:07:07] my last of my PowerPoint you can take it
[2:07:09] down Brother Jay so I I want to make
[2:07:13] this statement to you as I'm coming to
[2:07:15] the Finish
[2:07:16] Line I want to say it like this the
[2:07:19] world humiliates Ates in a way vastly
[2:07:24] different from when God does
[2:07:28] it looking up the word humiliation and
[2:07:33] uh you know I I had to to go and and and
[2:07:36] and the and I'll just give you some
[2:07:37] sources the psychology of Burton uh Neil
[2:07:40] Burton the psychology of humiliation
[2:07:43] Walter Torres uh humiliation its nature
[2:07:46] and consequences was in the Journal of
[2:07:48] American uh Psychiatry um uh there some
[2:07:52] other words I can't even pronounce and
[2:07:54] so psych website Psychology today and
[2:07:58] they're they're dealing with the anatomy
[2:08:00] of humiliation at working different
[2:08:02] things like that so I just want you to
[2:08:03] know this is where this is coming from
[2:08:06] so so humiliation now because I've said
[2:08:10] to you the world thinks of it
[2:08:11] differently than God does I just read
[2:08:14] you a prophet talking about how God
[2:08:15] humiliated Israel see he gave them what
[2:08:18] they need not what they
[2:08:19] wanted humil is often used in a way to
[2:08:23] assert power control or dominance over
[2:08:27] another person the general purpose can
[2:08:29] vary but it typically includes
[2:08:32] regardless of the and it makes this
[2:08:34] footnote regardless of the intent
[2:08:36] humiliation often leads to significant
[2:08:40] emotional distress and can have
[2:08:42] longlasting effects on the person being
[2:08:46] humiliated amen the general purpose
[2:08:52] of I realize now I've got it twice is
[2:08:54] because it's from a different Source the
[2:08:56] general purpose of humiliating a person
[2:08:58] often revolves around exerting power and
[2:09:02] control over them humiliation is a
[2:09:04] deliberate act intended to make someone
[2:09:07] feel inferior ashamed or disgraced often
[2:09:12] in the presence of others it seeks to
[2:09:15] have power and control it seeks to
[2:09:19] they'll they'll use humiliation and
[2:09:21] punish ment and deterrence they'll use
[2:09:24] humiliation and social dynamics see so
[2:09:27] that it can be used to enforce
[2:09:28] Conformity and social norms see you you
[2:09:32] don't believe that wokeism but you're
[2:09:34] you don't want to stand out so you just
[2:09:36] kind of be quiet and look like you're
[2:09:38] going along with it see there's
[2:09:41] psychological impact the effects of
[2:09:43] humiliation can be profound and
[2:09:45] longlasting lead to feelings of
[2:09:47] worthlessness depression anxiety and
[2:09:49] even post-traumatic stress
[2:09:51] the psychological damage can be severe
[2:09:54] affecting the victim's sense of
[2:09:56] self-worth and identity there's
[2:09:58] retaliation and revenge sometimes
[2:10:01] humiliation is used as a means of
[2:10:03] retaliation the humiliator May seek to
[2:10:05] inflict emotional pain on someone as
[2:10:08] revenge for a perceived wrong this can
[2:10:10] perpetuate cycles of humiliation and
[2:10:12] conflict so you just start a cycle
[2:10:14] rolling and then they do the same thing
[2:10:15] to the next person and they do the same
[2:10:17] thing to the next person see
[2:10:20] overall overall while the intention
[2:10:23] behind humiliating someone can vary it
[2:10:26] is generally a destructive act that can
[2:10:28] have significant negative consequences
[2:10:31] for the victim both psychologically and
[2:10:35] socially so I thought to myself what a
[2:10:38] contrast to the way God humiliates and
[2:10:43] you say brother Jason how can you say
[2:10:47] such a thing because in my experience
[2:10:51] and I dare say the experience of every
[2:10:54] child of God when God took me down a
[2:10:58] notch or two and laid me flat on my back
[2:11:01] he did it so that I could look up and
[2:11:03] see the one whom my soul
[2:11:06] loves is that your experience
[2:11:10] amen he knocked Paul out of the saddle
[2:11:13] and Paul though blinded could still see
[2:11:15] that light and hear that voice and
[2:11:18] that's all that mattered
[2:11:21] the you know Paul got knocked out of the
[2:11:23] saddle said that's horrible that didn't
[2:11:25] matter compared to what happened he saw
[2:11:28] the light he heard a voice he got a he
[2:11:31] got a porn again experience that's all
[2:11:33] that matters oh can I tell you today
[2:11:36] don't let the world young people don't
[2:11:39] let the world socially pressure you into
[2:11:42] moving away from God's word don't let
[2:11:44] Styles and Fashions and you might have
[2:11:46] friends going that way try to get them
[2:11:48] to not go that way but don't you go that
[2:11:50] way because you weren't destined to die
[2:11:53] here in a tribulation God didn't take
[2:11:56] you down notches and humiliate you and
[2:11:58] he won't if he's going to humiliate you
[2:11:59] tomorrow it won't be out of Revenge it
[2:12:02] won't be vindictive he's not doing it to
[2:12:05] cause you PST PST or psychological he's
[2:12:08] doing it so you can look up and see the
[2:12:10] one you love and see the one who loves
[2:12:14] you oh my friends I don't know I I don't
[2:12:18] know your view what your view of God is
[2:12:20] today or perhaps you know maybe I don't
[2:12:23] know maybe someone's display of Christ
[2:12:26] to you was false maybe someone gave you
[2:12:29] a false narrative I don't know what you
[2:12:31] went through but but I but I know this
[2:12:33] Jesus has the answers Oh my he has the
[2:12:37] answers he he he's he can be your all in
[2:12:40] all he can tell you what life is all
[2:12:42] about he can he can settle all your
[2:12:44] fears he can remove all your anxieties
[2:12:47] he can give you a very reason and a
[2:12:49] purpose to live
[2:12:51] not to die but to
[2:12:56] live he settles all my
[2:13:00] fears settles all my
[2:13:03] anxieties oh let Satan go about like a
[2:13:05] roaring lion let him let him let the
[2:13:07] Heathen rage the Heathen will always
[2:13:09] rage let the world fall apart I'm here

[2:14:04] but I can tell you I'm glad for every
[2:14:06] one of them I ever got because they made
[2:14:08] me into the kind of character that I am

[2:14:54] I I I know about sometimes the the
[2:14:59] dullness we can feel at times yeah I I'm
[2:15:03] aware of that we all have those times in
[2:15:06] our lives we all have those valleys and
[2:15:09] those mountain tops can you just
[2:15:10] remember that every Valley is bookended
[2:15:13] by
[2:15:14] mountaintops that's what makes it a
[2:15:17] valley so just keep going forward
[2:15:20] because I promise it wouldn't be a
[2:15:21] valley if there wasn't a mountain ahead
[2:15:23] and every mountain is bookended by
[2:15:25] valleys so that you're going to have
[2:15:27] mountain tops you're going to go through
[2:15:29] a valley but you're going home you're
[2:15:30] marching to Zion one of these days
[2:15:32] friends we're going to crush that last
[2:15:35] one one of these days we're going to be
[2:15:37] like Enoch and we're going to get so
[2:15:38] high up to top of that mountain and
[2:15:40] suddenly the Lord's going to say you're
[2:15:42] closer you're closer to Heaven than you
[2:15:43] are no need for another Valley come on
[2:15:46] higher oh hallelujah it's such a place
[2:15:49] of insanity the World drains us of our
[2:15:52] spiritual energy doesn't it brother
[2:15:55] brandham said it's a world we don't seem
[2:15:57] fitted to live in I I have such an
[2:16:00] affinity with that statement when a
[2:16:02] prophet says the world it it seems like
[2:16:06] we're not fitted like I'm not built for
[2:16:09] this you're not
[2:16:11] wrong you weren't Built For This you're
[2:16:13] built for a Garden of Eden you're the
[2:16:15] family of God I I know it's a place of
[2:16:18] insanity and you fought hard to stay up
[2:16:21] you know and uh and sometimes I you know
[2:16:24] if you're like me you can you you can
[2:16:26] feel more behind than you feel up but
[2:16:29] I'm here to tell you God can suddenly
[2:16:31] rush in let me just assure you God can
[2:16:33] suddenly rush
[2:16:36] in Bow your heads with
[2:16:45] me
[2:16:48] sometimes we've prayed a long time
[2:16:51] for lost loved
[2:16:54] ones sometimes we've Satan has had them
[2:16:59] for a long
[2:17:01] time could I say to you today but
[2:17:04] suddenly Hallelujah I know maybe you've
[2:17:08] been sick for a long time but suddenly
[2:17:12] prise I know the world can seem wearing
[2:17:15] I know it can drain us of our energy can
[2:17:18] can sap us of our spiritual fortitude
[2:17:20] ude but one of these
[2:17:23] mornings
[2:17:25] suddenly suddenly friends one of these
[2:17:28] mornings take courage today because
[2:17:31] suddenly the one whom you expect will
[2:17:34] suddenly come to his Temple father we
[2:17:38] love you today we thank you for this
[2:17:40] word we thank you for these
[2:17:42] people I thank you for the promise
[2:17:45] that's in your word today Lord I I want
[2:17:47] to be a part of that I want to be
[2:17:49] identified with that Lord sometimes you
[2:17:52] come and and and you do unexplainable
[2:17:55] things you come in unexpected ways and
[2:17:58] you do unexplainable things and I cannot
[2:18:01] account for everything that's happened
[2:18:03] in my life sometimes I don't know what
[2:18:05] to make of it sometimes I get in trial
[2:18:08] sometimes people get in trial they call
[2:18:10] me up they want prayer I don't even know
[2:18:12] what to make of it it seems so
[2:18:15] off-kilter it just seems so would would
[2:18:19] God actually do that but Lord you do all
[2:18:22] things
[2:18:23] well and even sometimes it's not
[2:18:26] necessarily that you did something but
[2:18:29] rather that you allowed
[2:18:31] something but I know this Lord I know
[2:18:34] this for sure one of these
[2:18:37] mornings
[2:18:39] suddenly one of these mornings I'll turn
[2:18:42] around and suddenly I'll be
[2:18:45] changed suddenly my loved ones will
[2:18:48] stand in my living room they're not dead
[2:18:50] they're is a next life there job knew
[2:18:52] that that was the question that plagued
[2:18:55] job it plagues all Humanity that does
[2:18:58] not have this Faith abiding in their
[2:19:01] hearts if a man
[2:19:03] die shall he live again if I go to
[2:19:06] church will I make it to Heaven if I
[2:19:09] read my Bible will God have favor on me
[2:19:12] if I do good deeds could I could I
[2:19:15] possibly earn my way these are questions
[2:19:18] Lord that people have strong believers
[2:19:22] who believe the word who believe it for
[2:19:24] real lord who love you with all their
[2:19:27] heart who love this word who who loathe
[2:19:31] their weaknesses and loathe their
[2:19:33] mistakes but yet the world so filled
[2:19:36] with drainage and and it just pulls it
[2:19:39] out of us and we have to constantly
[2:19:41] press and strain and press and strain
[2:19:44] father we dare not miss a service we
[2:19:46] dare not miss our prayer life we dare
[2:19:48] not miss opening our Bible we dare not
[2:19:50] Miss Fellowship of the saints of God we
[2:19:53] dare not apply the token I dare not
[2:19:55] apply the token over our homes Lord this
[2:19:58] is an age of insanity and it's pulling
[2:20:00] even hard at God's people we seem
[2:20:03] unfitted but suddenly what are these
[2:20:05] mornings suddenly oh god oh I look
[2:20:08] forward to it Lord I don't know if
[2:20:09] people here are weary maybe they've got
[2:20:11] sickness they fought a long time but
[2:20:14] suddenly maybe they've got children in
[2:20:16] the world but suddenly Lord you can
[2:20:18] suddenly come in in an unexpect Ed way
[2:20:21] and do something that is completely
[2:20:24] unexplainable I pray today that that'll
[2:20:27] be the result of this sermon I've went
[2:20:29] long the people have been patient but
[2:20:31] Lord it was on my heart you wouldn't
[2:20:33] allow me to stop I've told them time and
[2:20:35] time again I always seek to get
[2:20:37] permission can I stop every time I tried
[2:20:40] to stop you said keep going keep going I
[2:20:42] don't know maybe it's the last time
[2:20:44] someone will hear my voice but Lord may
[2:20:47] you come
[2:20:48] today maybe May to to prevent that from
[2:20:51] happening maybe somebody maybe some
[2:20:53] teenager maybe in this building maybe on
[2:20:56] the Internet is is is about to make a
[2:20:59] fatal
[2:21:02] decision may it not be so Lord may my
[2:21:05] words today echo down through the
[2:21:07] Canyons of their soul may they look up
[2:21:10] to you and say Lord God have mercy on me
[2:21:13] oh Lamb of God may it be so today Lord
[2:21:16] You've you've set my heart on fire with
[2:21:18] this sermon I just said I I because I so
[2:21:22] identify with it I identify with the
[2:21:25] struggle I but yet I identify with my
[2:21:28] love for your word but yet I identify
[2:21:30] with the weariness but yet I identify
[2:21:32] with my faith yet I identify with the
[2:21:34] influence of the world but I also
[2:21:36] identify with the truth of this hour it
[2:21:39] seems like Madness Lord but oh God I
[2:21:42] know you have a plan I know you have a
[2:21:44] purpose I know you're finding that last
[2:21:46] seed give us courage Jesus give us

[2:22:20] we don't know we we know generally I I
[2:22:24] know we're not going into tribulation
[2:22:26] but Lord it seems to be nipping at our
[2:22:29] heels we know that the man of sin is
[2:22:32] being revealed but we also know that we
[2:22:34] we he can't be fully until we're gone we
