[33:45] following section move by your spirit in
[33:50] the name of Jesus Christ we pray the
[33:51] church a man a man if you have your
[33:55] Bibles let's turn to the Book of Luke
[33:57] the fifth chapter Luke chapter five a
[34:07] man I covet your prayers tonight Luke
[34:21] chapter 5 let's start reading at verse
[34:33] 17 the Bible says and it came to pass on
[34:41] a certain day as he was teaching that
[34:46] there were Pharisees and doctors of the
[34:48] law sitting by which were come out to
[34:51] every town of Galilee and Judea and
[34:54] Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was
[34:57] present to heal them and behold men
[35:01] brought in a bed a man which was taken
[35:04] with a palsy and and they sought means
[35:11] to bring him in and to lay him before
[35:15] him and when they could not find by what
[35:20] way they might bring him in because of
[35:24] the multitude they went up on the
[35:27] housetop and led him down through the
[35:31] thing which his couch unto the mist
[35:35] before Jesus and when he saw their faith
[35:37] he said unto them man thy sins are
[35:41] forgiven thee a man may Lord bless me
[35:45] knows where you can have your seats amen
[35:49] tonight
[35:50] by the grace of God the Lord the Lord's
[35:54] just been kind of dealing with me you
[35:57] know with my thought process you know
[35:59] with with my mind and how I perceive
[36:02] things and and just making sure I'm not
[36:06] living by fear you know because we know
[36:09] the Bible says that perilous times will
[36:12] come but the thing of it is how do we
[36:15] react in those perilous times knowing
[36:18] that God told us it was going to happen
[36:20] you know and tonight my topic is the
[36:25] believers mindset you know one thing
[36:29] about a believer we should believe at
[36:32] all times amen no matter what's taking
[36:35] place there should be something in us
[36:38] that just kicks in and say well God said
[36:42] this and this is where I'm standing
[36:44] hallelujah and you know we just can't
[36:47] quite get away from you know the time
[36:50] we're in with this pandemic and
[36:53] quarantine and all these things but if I
[36:57] can be honest Church to me it's just the
[37:00] devil making up more names hallelujah
[37:03] that's how I feel about it you know
[37:05] because once the the the system of
[37:08] whoever it is once they came out and
[37:11] made the statement I said uh-huh once
[37:16] they came out and see the devil has a
[37:20] problem with people that no God is
[37:22] healer he has a problem with people who
[37:26] live by that witness of what he did in
[37:29] their lives because they have those
[37:31] sickness and all these things with the
[37:34] mind of a believer oh yeah so you
[37:36] already into to certain characteristics
[37:40] but when they came out and everything to
[37:43] talk about the depend emic in the
[37:45] quarantine or whatever you call it the
[37:47] virus code 19 when they came out they
[37:50] said they're expecting the second wave
[37:53] in September I'm like how can you expect
[37:57] the second wave of a virus unless you
[38:00] doing something to make it move that way
[38:03] haruya
[38:04] nobody can predict when somebody's gonna
[38:06] get sick huh
[38:08] unless you doing something to make them
[38:10] sick oh yeah so in my mind I'm saying
[38:15] the devil is up to something
[38:16] so Church we are to be holy steadfast on
[38:21] the Word of God we ought to know that
[38:24] oh yeah that a lot of times when things
[38:26] happen is more spiritually natural hey
[38:30] man that the enemy is up the southern
[38:32] end and whenever the prophet of God will
[38:34] say he said that uh when you can see the
[38:37] devil unleashed and ranting and raging
[38:40] you better believe God is unleash also
[38:43] but you know Church when I look and I
[38:46] think about our mind sensing and our
[38:49] sauce the perfect God he said you are
[38:52] what your thoughts are oh yeah and when
[38:55] it comes to the life you live a lot of
[38:57] times you are what's your thoughts in
[39:00] the Bible says as a man thinketh in his
[39:03] heart so is he
[39:04] we can't get away from that husband you
[39:08] know uh probably amen you know our
[39:11] sitting I was thinking about this
[39:13] particular thing right here the salt
[39:15] process you know it brought me to a
[39:19] particular word honey a particular
[39:21] phrase Amen
[39:23] how many knows what it means to have a
[39:25] paradigm shift and I just want to give
[39:29] you the salt behind that a paradigm
[39:31] shift a paradigm shift means a
[39:34] fundamental change in approach or
[39:37] underlining assumptions hugs so you
[39:40] changed the way you approach when the
[39:43] paradigm begins to shift on in church in
[39:46] this our whole you got to change the way
[39:50] you think honey you can't see the way
[39:53] you saw earlier yesteryear because
[39:56] things are intensifying amen
[39:58] so you got to have a deeper experience
[40:01] with God hurting your mind hallelujah
[40:04] your spirit hallelujah he has to be
[40:06] under control of the Holy Ghost because
[40:09] these are shifting and if you're not
[40:12] conscious enough you're going to shift
[40:16] but with a
[40:18] takes place hozier a lot of times hey
[40:21] man let's just say in a natural it's the
[40:24] devil doing something but that doesn't
[40:29] take away that God is still present so
[40:33] you have to watch how things are
[40:35] shifting and keep your testimony hardly
[40:38] you know as I look and I begin to think
[40:40] about amen
[40:42] the paradigm and how things are shift
[40:44] you know this whole thing is all about
[40:46] producing fear you got people now then
[40:53] it's back slid they read their Bibles
[40:56] again they they they even streaming some
[41:00] of the churches but is that coming from
[41:03] a desire from God
[41:04] or is that coming from fear honey see
[41:07] the paradigm harlot
[41:09] it's shifting and it's making them
[41:11] question where they go oh yeah it's
[41:15] making them question hurry up
[41:16] if this thing honey was to get ahold of
[41:19] me will I die hallelujah but you can't
[41:21] serve God because you're afraid of death
[41:24] honey you have to serve God because you
[41:26] love him huh that is the believers mind
[41:30] we worship because we love him
[41:33] we serve him because we love him we're
[41:35] here tonight because we love him not
[41:38] because we drew straws or different
[41:40] things took place we're here tonight
[41:42] because we love God Hurley
[41:45] you know I begin to think Hurley what
[41:48] happens to some animals when they're
[41:50] afraid when some animals are free and
[41:53] you were just taking an animal he's
[41:55] going out to hunt hey man it never comes
[41:57] a paradigm seems Hurley maybe one
[42:00] of his enemies is not there in the same
[42:02] place so what can he do
[42:04] there's a dynamic about some animals
[42:08] that was fear and things change
[42:13] Hurley they begin to camouflage
[42:16] themselves
[42:20] what is making that camouflage either
[42:24] they're hiding to pounce or they're
[42:26] hiding because of fear right now there's
[42:30] a lot of camouflage Saints around about
[42:33] there's a lot of people who you who are
[42:36] camouflaged some of them look like
[42:38] they're still a part of the church and
[42:39] some of them are sitting there
[42:40] can't wait to the opportunity so they
[42:42] can quit Church Harley because of a pen
[42:45] gimmick and always some people happy
[42:47] they can stay home some people are
[42:51] hoping the church never opens back up
[42:54] because they don't have a desire so you
[42:59] have to be careful when the paradigm
[43:01] comes Harley because when the paradigm
[43:03] comes the real you will come out with
[43:07] these begin to shift the real you will
[43:09] come out earlier and you normally begin
[43:12] to do what's in your mind first you take
[43:17] that animal that's being hunted you
[43:19] he'll go to a certain surroundings or an
[43:22] environment and he'll try to camouflage
[43:24] himself to sit there but you know what
[43:26] he's still the same animal nothing about
[43:30] him changes he still has the the same
[43:34] fear hallelujah he still has the same
[43:36] coat he still has all the same genetics
[43:39] a man but what is changing him fear in a
[43:46] lot of people are afraid oh yeah because
[43:48] I was taking place Church a couple of
[43:50] weeks ago this was the first trip I did
[43:53] since all these things taking place I
[43:55] went in the airport it almost felt like
[43:57] a third-world country people walk around
[44:01] with masks on and and all these things
[44:03] and I'm like what day what are we gonna
[44:06] do when they say okay everything can go
[44:08] back to normal how many people are going
[44:12] to be able to go back to normal
[44:14] that's the question can we go back to
[44:18] normal
[44:19] can't we come to church hurry can I come
[44:22] to church this church and shake brother
[44:24] Jason hands and don't think about the
[44:26] pandemic can I come in and say god bless
[44:31] you brothers
[44:32] give you hope and not think about a
[44:34] virus worry yourself be with the
[44:39] paradigm shifts Chloe will you still be
[44:44] operating on the fear or will you say
[44:47] this is who I am this is who I am
[44:51] I'm a believer hallelujah I believe in
[44:53] Jesus Christ
[44:54] he's the giver of all life hurry hurry
[44:57] but you know this church hallelujah we
[45:00] have people sitting right among us holy
[45:02] and they don't believe happy there's no
[45:11] church happy that we have live streaming
[45:15] in the homes happy pick up the computer
[45:19] or whatever and go to church that's all
[45:23] right oh yeah but I know this church see
[45:25] you have to catch the shift because when
[45:27] things shift it be the devil shipping
[45:29] you away from God if you're not careful
[45:33] now I'm not saying God doesn't have his
[45:35] hand in things to hurry because
[45:38] sometimes in times like this God
[45:40] challenges us to see where our mindset
[45:43] is he challenges us to see where we are
[45:47] spiritually hardly so I wonder how many
[45:49] people are in battle tab on heaven Jesus
[45:53] Christ having all the different
[45:55] Tabernacles I'm gonna be busting the
[45:57] door down to get back in and worship you
[46:04] said Briggs why do you say that because
[46:06] the paradigm is trying to shift us away
[46:10] from gathering when the Bible says when
[46:14] we see these things we ought to gather
[46:16] them all so we gonna believe you believe
[46:22] the quarantine or even believe what the
[46:26] Bible says something my pastor said when
[46:29] it's all first started and it stuck with
[46:32] me until this day he was preaching and
[46:35] he he made a statement he said Saints we
[46:39] don't come to church ain't gonna close
[46:41] the doors unless they make me close the
[46:43] doors but we're gonna try to
[46:45] the best we can to obligate whatever
[46:47] Caesar saying he said but I want you to
[46:50] understand one thing if God can't
[46:53] protect us in church where can he
[46:55] protect us people come to church all
[46:59] afraid oh I guarantee you right now if I
[47:03] come up cleaning steam by hand you have
[47:05] a thought you will have a whole little
[47:10] salt you have a quarantine salt because
[47:15] that's where we have shifted so what's
[47:20] gonna what's gonna get you back where
[47:21] you need to be you have to stay with the
[47:23] Word of God
[47:24] oh yeah the Word of God is the only
[47:27] thing that can put us back on track
[47:29] oh yeah in church when I look at I think
[47:32] about animals that camouflage as soon as
[47:37] soon as the trouble is gold they go back
[47:41] to their natural color look at holy look
[47:48] at the church 911 and passing out Bibles
[47:50] and Billy Graham and all these people
[47:52] having Crusades and everything oh let's
[47:55] have a prayer and a look at New York now
[47:58] it's back to whatever it was it's back
[48:01] to heaven ride the underwear in the
[48:03] subway they the believers mind said
[48:13] don't get caught up in the paradigm
[48:18] because things are shifting but for us
[48:20] they're shifting closer to God early
[48:24] church I know without a shadow of a
[48:26] doubt for the believers God is building
[48:29] character I don't know about you but God
[48:33] even he even made me question my own
[48:36] experience clothes grain which is all
[48:40] first started earlier I caught the fruit
[48:45] there was an old boy you got it you got
[48:49] it all you you coronavirus Karuna
[48:52] behinds are you come on
[48:54] I betcha we can special
[48:56] virus never heard of it before lying
[49:02] devil made a virus out the hacker holic
[49:05] drink you know what the enemy what
[49:14] happened I went and worked out and I'm
[49:15] sure this has happened to somebody
[49:17] before I went and worked out and South
[49:19] Carolina I loved it
[49:20] hallelujah but we got the craziest
[49:22] weather on or on earth honey you know
[49:25] one minute it's hot one minute it's cold
[49:27] honey so one one morning I was working
[49:29] out real early and I and I and I went
[49:31] out the gym with no jacket on and I was
[49:34] wet honey and then my sweat got cold and
[49:38] they say you know I got a fever Church I
[49:43] didn't get a call I didn't get a runny
[49:47] nose I didn't get any other symptoms but
[49:50] a fever and you know the enemy tried to
[49:52] do he tried to get in my mind they said
[49:55] yeah that's that's one that's one of the
[49:57] clear signs that you got it a fever you
[50:04] need to get some mama and take your
[50:05] temperature but y'all knowing me I told
[50:10] the devil shut up I don't have anything
[50:14] I'm gonna fight honey so you know what I
[50:17] did I put bro clothes on sweating out a
[50:22] man sweating it out but one thing haruya
[50:25] about the flu it don't give up easy
[50:27] it'll make you think it's good and then
[50:30] it'll come back honey I wonder how many
[50:32] people thought that they were where they
[50:35] were supposed to be and found out that
[50:37] they were lacking a whole lot knocking
[50:41] the whole lot and God allowed the
[50:43] pandemic to take place so you can see
[50:45] where you are before the rapture he
[50:50] allowed us holy
[50:51] some of us honey to feel fear and
[50:54] incomplete no least ease why so we can
[50:57] crowd because God knew what our mindset
[51:01] was a man church my daughter came over
[51:03] said I was my big girl she came over oh
[51:06] yeah
[51:07] cuz she's fixed that I wasn't telling
[51:11] the truth huh see what's in your mind
[51:16] were you going through stuff
[51:17] one thing the enemy ain't gonna get from
[51:20] me he ain't gonna get a confession that
[51:22] he's doing something you know the
[51:26] greatest battle ever fought is where and
[51:29] the prophet of God says when it comes to
[51:32] sickness where does it come from
[51:34] he says it's a spirit before it becomes
[51:37] a disease and you have to accept that
[51:40] spirit in your mind before it develops
[51:43] in your body and once you accept it in
[51:47] your mind you make it live because your
[51:52] mind is a womb hallelujah hey man
[51:55] your wounds are proper God said your
[51:57] mind holy is the gateway to the soul can
[52:04] you think about that you create life in
[52:06] your thoughts I give you a prime example
[52:10] you wake up believe you coming down with
[52:23] you'd open the gate it's coming now what
[52:27] is gonna be named is up to you because
[52:31] you could be confident coughing coughing
[52:34] coughing holy but until you accept the
[52:37] salt it could just be leading you
[52:39] through it could just be dust honey but
[52:43] what can dust do to you nothing but once
[52:46] you say oh I'm catching a cold you
[52:49] better believe you gonna catch it you
[52:53] didn't open the gate how through your
[52:55] thoughts you gave it nice hug Oh
[53:02] what is the believers Minds just like we
[53:07] can give her the carnal things life we
[53:10] should be able to give the spiritual
[53:12] beach life by confessing truth amen by
[53:16] confessing regards chance God says I'm
[53:19] the head and
[53:19] the tail why can't I believe that and
[53:22] confess it and watch it materialize in
[53:25] my life that's a beauty believe was mine
[53:28] oh yeah you know like I said I was
[53:31] fighting and fighting you know my
[53:33] daughter came over with some medicine
[53:34] and when she came over but Jason I had
[53:37] on another t-shirt I have on my thermal
[53:41] over that I had on my hoodie and I had
[53:45] my water cooler she look at me and say
[53:51] daddy you see you know I'm good the hood
[53:57] sauce she was judging how I feel about
[54:02] what she saw you know a lot of times
[54:05] your eyes can't tell the truth honey
[54:08] sometimes you can see something you know
[54:11] I preached in our church honey I put a
[54:13] pitch up and I said hey you know we say
[54:15] a picture's worth a thousand words right
[54:17] now we say a picture's worth a thousand
[54:20] words that we believe that that's Jesus
[54:22] in the original rule
[54:23] pictures worth a thousand words amen we
[54:26] look at it and say yeah I see that
[54:27] that's what it is but think about this
[54:30] honey what good is a picture without the
[54:33] right content everything behind that
[54:39] thing is just your fault without the
[54:42] right content you could be believing a
[54:45] lot oh yeah but you're judging it by
[54:47] your eyesight no you don't live by your
[54:51] mind oh yeah trust God dealing with your
[54:54] heart cuz your mind can get confused cuz
[54:58] it is a battleground that's why he said
[55:04] there's this mind that was in Christ
[55:06] being you but you know she came in and
[55:09] she had some different medicine and all
[55:11] these things you know as time progressed
[55:13] she said she said you know the devil's
[55:17] telling me say hey you need to UM
[55:19] I guess the momma then take your to
[55:21] nothin right cuz then it'll show that
[55:25] I'm believing what he's saying in my
[55:27] head don't you know the devil started
[55:31] you
[55:33] Hill puts up in your head and you keep
[55:36] thinking and thinking about and then you
[55:37] gonna do it so you don't know what's in
[55:42] your heart huh
[55:44] but what he's trying to do is get on
[55:45] this battleground and make you go
[55:47] through the actions that's what he did
[55:52] that's what he did was Eve the prophet
[55:54] of God said she committed adultery first
[55:56] up here think she went but when he came
[56:02] to a believer hurry up
[56:04] when it came to Adam he couldn't even
[56:06] approach why because I was mine was
[56:08] steadfast on God he knew better so you
[56:14] know I felt the salt in one night I was
[56:17] laying in the bed I knew I was burning I
[56:19] mean I said bright I mean wow I'm burnin
[56:33] up laying in the bed undercover with all
[56:37] these clothes on you know those words
[56:56] was enough power to back the devil up
[56:58] honey
[56:59] he said the wicked Christians only needs
[57:01] can't defeat the devil anytime anyplace
[57:04] anywhere honey you just got the
[57:07] Hallelujah have the right confession he
[57:10] I might have told you this testimony
[57:12] before but it was a sister hallelujah
[57:14] Amen who who don't know we know but she
[57:18] committed adultery and the woman she
[57:20] husband she committed adultery honey she
[57:23] believed in witchcraft huh
[57:25] so she went to the voodoo doctor and
[57:26] told her told him I want you to kill
[57:29] this woman who spit on my luck he said
[57:31] he said no problem I need my $5,000 he
[57:35] was proven from doing spells and
[57:37] everything he said give me five thousand
[57:39] US and I do it she said okay I'm gonna
[57:41] do it without she's walking out she
[57:43] saying by the way she's supposed to be a
[57:44] Christian
[57:45] my not do it for free I'll kill her for
[57:50] free so he got to mixing up his posters
[57:54] and doing all this stuff huh
[57:56] a week later the lady was still living
[57:58] opposed to be dead so the woman came
[58:01] back and she said hey she's still alive
[58:04] we started saying let me tell you I was
[58:09] doing what I normally do and I got a
[58:13] visitation from my boss
[58:17] one of the chief demons he said I got a
[58:20] visitation and he told me
[58:22] leave her alone because she's already
[58:24] repented oh the devil knows he can't
[58:33] touch you when you are - the blood he
[58:36] knows what you ask God for forgiveness
[58:38] he has to leave you alone unless you
[58:42] accept that you feel guilty then we will
[58:55] and these animals camouflage themselves
[58:58] utterly the midst of trouble listen but
[59:01] they don't change her every quality
[59:04] remains in it earlier it just learns to
[59:07] adapt to its environment church clothes
[59:12] wow we're adapting let's not forget that
[59:15] we ride while we're adapting Hullinger
[59:20] there's something going on behind the
[59:22] scenes I don't think they looking at who
[59:26] stopped Church all together and who's
[59:28] doing everything they can do to keep it
[59:30] going
[59:33] don't think they watching it honey
[59:36] don't think they check it out who still
[59:38] streaming in who's still coming in all
[59:40] these things hurry
[59:41] cuz you know what they got to have hurry
[59:44] a clue of who's gonna receive the mark
[59:47] of the beast see ain't it ain't so much
[59:54] for denominations they're like praise
[59:57] God they just go in and shut down
[59:59] no they're gonna get a big old fat check
[1:00:00] from that stimulus so they gladly do it
[1:00:04] cuz they know they're gonna be taken
[1:00:05] care but for those of us who do this
[1:00:07] because we love God we worrying about
[1:00:09] the tiling we worried about the money
[1:00:11] and all these different things
[1:00:13] we do because we love God and we want to
[1:00:15] have the people in a in a Christian
[1:00:16] godly atmosphere Holly will only connect
[1:00:19] you to the love of God you look
[1:00:22] different but a man but church look at
[1:00:32] the believers mindset now God was he was
[1:00:39] in a home teaching the preaching and the
[1:00:42] Bible said that honey
[1:00:45] his presence was daring healings there
[1:00:49] so these brothers they gathered up one
[1:00:52] of their brothers Harley they probably
[1:00:54] couldn't touch him because it's a
[1:00:55] quarantine so they had him on a cot
[1:01:00] couldn't go through the crowd it was too
[1:01:02] many people honey he meant but I wanted
[1:01:06] to hurry that if this place wasn't
[1:01:08] crowded out in the midst of the
[1:01:09] quarantine would you try to make your
[1:01:11] way in would you say gay brother Jason
[1:01:17] to call but you know better you can't
[1:01:19] have all the many people here like this
[1:01:21] you know you heard what they said
[1:01:27] just follow me
[1:01:30] just follow we know we have certain
[1:01:32] protocols and things but just follow me
[1:01:35] I want to deal with your mind because
[1:01:38] when the enemy is trying to get us to do
[1:01:39] to live in fear try to live in fear when
[1:01:44] we come to church
[1:01:45] just imagine somebody start shouting and
[1:01:48] they just touch you in you are you gonna
[1:01:50] have to do every time we shake hands
[1:02:00] sister we got the sanitary
[1:02:05] any little sanitizer in the world to
[1:02:08] keep all his clean like that but I'll
[1:02:11] tell you one thing earlier
[1:02:13] that's enough confession of the blood of
[1:02:15] Jesus Christ to keep them demons back
[1:02:17] honey there are demons lingering whether
[1:02:21] we know it or not hallelujah you know
[1:02:23] and me and somebody else was talking
[1:02:24] okay yeah you put the gloves on the CCC
[1:02:28] y'all forgive me cause this stuff is
[1:02:30] silly I'm not telling you not to be safe
[1:02:35] I'm just talking about for me you know
[1:02:37] but it's kind of silly to me because you
[1:02:40] say you put gloves on and you know and
[1:02:42] you got to don't touch this and don't
[1:02:43] touch that okay you take one glove off
[1:02:46] then what they and do that hand got to
[1:02:50] trust the gloves take it off and people
[1:02:56] think they're being protected the only
[1:03:02] way you can get that girl out without
[1:03:03] touching is doing some kind of way you
[1:03:10] got to use this free hand to get it off
[1:03:12] just free uncovers hands to get it off
[1:03:17] while you didn't walk around and
[1:03:19] touching all the stuff and I take it a
[1:03:20] step further huh you walk around with a
[1:03:23] man so how you gonna get the mask off
[1:03:25] without touching it you all ready to
[1:03:29] throw it a big old dog Vader man song
[1:03:36] don't forgive me but I let me see it
[1:03:41] i'ma say I'm your father
[1:03:50] we figure by the church you walk around
[1:03:52] with the mass song you got to touch the
[1:03:56] mash to take it off where is it
[1:04:05] am I making any sense
[1:04:07] I'm not telling you how to do what you
[1:04:10] do wherever your faith is hug it but one
[1:04:14] thing I want you to realize some things
[1:04:16] we declare to be faith we say we love
[1:04:23] God and we really don't you think God
[1:04:43] didn't have that setup you think God
[1:04:47] didn't allow that to get a hold of them
[1:04:48] because it was their time but you look
[1:04:56] at the believers faith you look at this
[1:04:57] this is man hallelujah
[1:04:59] these brothers say they come to the
[1:05:01] crowd and and there was social
[1:05:03] distancing they couldn't go through
[1:05:05] crowd and say you know what we're gonna
[1:05:07] go up on the roof look at their minds
[1:05:10] eat honey whatever we got to do we're
[1:05:14] gonna get our brother in the presence of
[1:05:16] the Lord in church that's I feel
[1:05:19] whatever I got to do I want to remain in
[1:05:23] his presence honey
[1:05:25] patty because no pandemic virus or no
[1:05:27] virus holy I wanna be with Jesus because
[1:05:33] he's the only one that can help me he's
[1:05:35] the only one that can strengthen me and
[1:05:37] save me honey
[1:05:38] Church they have been other killer
[1:05:40] viruses before those remember the
[1:05:42] pandemic call AIDS now it's just an
[1:05:49] afterthought usually nobody talking
[1:05:52] about
[1:05:57] let's be careful when things hit the
[1:05:59] paradigm and it's shifting you changed
[1:06:02] your approach watch it be careful
[1:06:04] because of this you don't change your
[1:06:07] approach to worship you people afraid to
[1:06:13] lift the hands because they take a virus
[1:06:15] on it gonna be in church like this I
[1:06:25] hope I'm making sister Church
[1:06:28] listen know how mind says think about
[1:06:36] where we are and how we talk to God and
[1:06:39] what we expect from God I want to read
[1:06:42] you a scripture that just blew me away
[1:06:44] let's go to job chapter 13 don't worry
[1:06:54] I'm bound by the coals Joel chapter 13
[1:07:06] verse 18 listen what the Bible says this
[1:07:09] says behold I have or I have all of my
[1:07:13] calls I know that I shall be justified
[1:07:18] or meets you requests holy the Bible is
[1:07:25] telling us we have the power to request
[1:07:28] earlier what we stand in needling to
[1:07:32] says I all of my calls holier and I know
[1:07:35] that I shall be justified he's saying
[1:07:38] holier what I ask for I know I'm gonna
[1:07:41] receive we're in that time does your
[1:07:45] mind operate like that were you going to
[1:07:48] pray unto God and ex-con and you order
[1:07:50] your calls
[1:07:51] do you believe that you're justified in
[1:07:53] what you're asking and if you're
[1:07:56] justified God has to move on your behalf
[1:07:59] because when you speak he only hears his
[1:08:02] voice Wow you have the ability to make
[1:08:10] your child turn into what you wanted you
[1:08:13] I have ordered my calls
[1:08:17] honey I know that I shall be justified
[1:08:24] that jumped out to me because I was
[1:08:26] listening to a message and listen what
[1:08:29] the prophecies about Joel listen I have
[1:08:33] I have heard but now see 65
[1:08:35] I got paragraph 27 let me help
[1:08:42] but it says but Satan thought he could
[1:08:46] twist him around a little bit and cuff
[1:08:49] him up and make him do it but you see
[1:08:52] see the devil thought he knew Joe's mind
[1:08:57] he thought he knew what Joe was thinking
[1:09:00] he said hey if I take his riches if I
[1:09:03] take his family if I take this I take
[1:09:05] that he will
[1:09:06] serving but job wasn't connected to his
[1:09:09] natural things he was connected to that
[1:09:11] sacrifice he was connected to that blood
[1:09:20] he said Joe with his oh my just doesn't
[1:09:23] so problem
[1:09:24] he says but you see job with this
[1:09:27] perfect revelation of God
[1:09:30] we can have a perfect revelation of God
[1:09:35] and I'll give you a clue of what it
[1:09:38] means to have a perfect revelation of
[1:09:40] God a perfect revelation of God is
[1:09:44] knowing like the Bible says that he is
[1:09:49] hallelujah he is whatever you need him
[1:09:52] to be you need him to be a healer he is
[1:09:55] a healer he either deliver hallelujah he
[1:09:58] is my hope he is my peace hallelujah
[1:10:00] that's a perfect revelation of God
[1:10:03] knowing that God can do anything and
[1:10:07] knowing that God does not change no
[1:10:10] matter what's going on on this earth
[1:10:14] this is a job with this perfect
[1:10:17] revelation of God in who God will see
[1:10:20] not only did he has a revelation he knew
[1:10:22] who God was so when things arose in his
[1:10:26] life he could look at that and judge it
[1:10:28] by his revelation and he could say
[1:10:30] that's not God or that is God she knew
[1:10:34] who God was come on somebody I hope you
[1:10:38] know who God is
[1:10:39] oh yeah he said in how God loves him see
[1:10:45] look at look at how the Prophet says you
[1:10:47] say he said he had a perfect revelation
[1:10:49] of God he knew who God was and how God
[1:10:53] loved him that's the biggest question
[1:10:56] people have today does God love me
[1:11:00] anybody going through something
[1:11:03] he says that's how God shows his love
[1:11:06] it's elected love if he loves you he
[1:11:10] allows you to go through a trial even
[1:11:13] though I already had testimonies of
[1:11:15] healing I had to fight the flu honey you
[1:11:19] know I talked about it
[1:11:20] after I came out cuz I wasn't going in
[1:11:24] the midst of the flu saying oh I got it
[1:11:27] because I would have made it stronger so
[1:11:31] what I did I kept cast it down till one
[1:11:34] day oh yeah I broke out it was good I
[1:11:42] don't know if I told y'all about my mama
[1:11:46] my mama at the same time she was she was
[1:11:50] feeling a little sick but she was
[1:11:54] feeling that way way longer before me
[1:11:56] and we didn't know it honey
[1:11:58] she believed was mined said they'll sit
[1:12:00] and wrestle with something sometimes
[1:12:02] believe in God oh yeah and she writes
[1:12:05] the winning arousal winning huh
[1:12:07] and she was taking some medicine and it
[1:12:09] was dehydrating her so she my sister
[1:12:13] winning took her to the hospital and she
[1:12:15] called my sister come say I just dropped
[1:12:17] my mother you did right now the hospital
[1:12:23] is the worst place to be because it's an
[1:12:28] atmosphere of death now an atmosphere of
[1:12:33] healing is an atmosphere of death first
[1:12:36] thing they do earlier is they run tests
[1:12:38] and they pronounced sickness on you and
[1:12:40] then they isolate you isolate you into a
[1:12:44] place to where your loved ones can't see
[1:12:46] you none of your family members so why
[1:12:48] are you going through it a spirit of
[1:12:50] depression can come because of the
[1:12:53] isolation honey which will bring forth
[1:12:56] more sadness but by God's grace
[1:13:01] my mom had a weapon ho ain't goin where
[1:13:06] you think I'm going honey
[1:13:07] she had a weapon with her when she went
[1:13:09] to the hospital it was cold
[1:13:16] she had that cell phone and when she
[1:13:22] checked in to say son I just wanna let
[1:13:23] you know I got checked into the hospital
[1:13:25] I said what's going on yes I was just
[1:13:27] hydrating I came in to get checked out
[1:13:30] for that I said okay praise God next
[1:13:32] time I told you say hey
[1:13:33] you know sound good I wish to add some
[1:13:35] better food in here and then she came to
[1:13:40] testify her she said when she walked in
[1:13:42] they start to run all they test and do
[1:13:45] all they dissing and they say oh you
[1:13:47] might have it she say have what you
[1:13:49] might have the control device
[1:13:50] she says look I have ordered my calls
[1:13:54] and I know that I am justified she said
[1:13:57] look I came in here because I'm
[1:13:59] dehydrated y'all gonna treat me for
[1:14:01] dehydration and I'm leaving
[1:14:05] maybe the proper guard said earlier you
[1:14:09] don't have to accept the bag around
[1:14:11] snakes no matter what the atmosphere
[1:14:14] look like no matter what the whole the
[1:14:17] paradigm is her you get all of your
[1:14:20] calls
[1:14:22] she told the nurse I came in here for
[1:14:25] dehydration she said yeah but you got
[1:14:27] symptoms for this and simply for that my
[1:14:29] mama looked at his head dehydration and
[1:14:35] she was so convincing by Jason that they
[1:14:38] will spend let her go but they they read
[1:14:41] her chart and they found out she was in
[1:14:43] her 70s and it's up those are the people
[1:14:48] that's catching the virus so ma'am we
[1:14:50] can't let you go she said what you mean
[1:14:52] we can't let you go we need to run some
[1:14:54] more tests she said for hydration
[1:14:55] dehydration do all the tests I need so
[1:15:01] anyway they end up keep you know I call
[1:15:04] when she call me hallelujah and I found
[1:15:07] out it was keeping up saying next time
[1:15:08] don't you ever go to the hospital
[1:15:11] without praying with us first
[1:15:13] well I saved me cuz I believe what the
[1:15:19] Bible says he gave us power over unclean
[1:15:21] spirits
[1:15:22] oh sorry Church I'm trying to come down
[1:15:25] amen but you know she's in there a
[1:15:27] couple days they was testing the testing
[1:15:28] and couldn't find it you know when you
[1:15:30] go to the doctor and they can't find
[1:15:33] that that means it's a spirit they're
[1:15:35] trying to get you to accept honey but
[1:15:37] the only way you can have it is once you
[1:15:39] say okay I believe you
[1:15:41] I got you mr. doctor you so smart
[1:15:45] and you got what they're telling you to
[1:15:47] get huh
[1:15:48] how many people ever knew they had
[1:15:50] cancer without a doctor telling them
[1:15:52] first
[1:15:56] some people whipped it with that feeling
[1:15:58] fine and caliber then they said oh we
[1:16:00] see some Bruce Ehlers I feel good oh we
[1:16:03] think he got cancer and didn't start
[1:16:05] twisting remember it's a spirit before
[1:16:09] it becomes a disease the believers
[1:16:12] mindset honey but you know my mom I
[1:16:15] thank God for you know she she she was
[1:16:17] in there and in a couple days and - I
[1:16:20] think about two days now they said I
[1:16:22] think it took about a week to get the
[1:16:23] test back but her cat in her case it
[1:16:26] came back in two days that's kind of
[1:16:29] suspicious to me big doctor come back
[1:16:32] she say you look like a well-educated
[1:16:33] man a black man well educated the head
[1:16:37] doctor he comes in and say hey man why
[1:16:40] are you doing she said I'm doing good
[1:16:41] he says did they tell you she's like
[1:16:43] tell me what you got the fire she say
[1:16:46] look man and I know that I'm justified
[1:16:54] she chose the head doctor that was
[1:16:57] running all the tests running all the
[1:16:59] nurses and running that floor in the
[1:17:01] hospital honey she looked him straight
[1:17:03] in his face and she said look man I came
[1:17:05] in here for dehydration and that's all
[1:17:08] I'm getting treated for what else could
[1:17:14] he say but okay so they kept a little
[1:17:19] bit longer did you put on a slow boxes
[1:17:22] but it was too late that weapon she
[1:17:28] calling all of us huh talking to us amen
[1:17:30] we laughing on the phone brother Jason I
[1:17:32] don't think one time she called to say
[1:17:35] come on let's pray I'm feeling defeated
[1:17:37] not one time we just rejoice in the
[1:17:40] garden talking about the grace of God
[1:17:42] and making your stand
[1:17:44] o believers minds how do you respond
[1:17:47] when you meet adversity anyway to make a
[1:17:54] long story short
[1:17:56] she ended up leaving without the virus
[1:18:00] and just getting treated for dehydration
[1:18:02] just like she said and the doctor comes
[1:18:07] in says oh my you have a lucky case you
[1:18:09] say no I'm covered by the blood ain't
[1:18:11] nothing lucky by this what is our
[1:18:19] mindset what are we going through listen
[1:18:21] he says job job had a perfect revelation
[1:18:23] of God who he was and how God loved him
[1:18:26] how he waited
[1:18:28] hallelujah no matter what the
[1:18:30] circumstance was he waited listen to us
[1:18:32] he waited for his faith to be confirmed
[1:18:35] because he knew hurry up oh my he
[1:18:40] because he had a grip on God think about
[1:18:47] it the believer has a right to touch God
[1:18:51] we have a right to grab ahold of God in
[1:18:55] our circumstance we have a right Amen
[1:18:57] huh to get as close as we can and say
[1:19:00] God I believe you he said a revelation
[1:19:06] that spoke of last night he said now
[1:19:09] when the sick people that's in the
[1:19:11] healing in the building the crippled
[1:19:13] people and using have need of God when
[1:19:16] you can meet that type of revelation
[1:19:18] that you are justified when you are holy
[1:19:21] actually justified in asking the thing
[1:19:24] that you asked him for and believe that
[1:19:27] he is a rewarder of those that didn't
[1:19:29] seek Him there's nothing can ever
[1:19:32] separate you from that faith that's
[1:19:35] anchoring you that's the mindset of a
[1:19:40] believer huh will you go pray you
[1:19:43] believe that you're already justified
[1:19:45] before you even ask knowing I'm gonna
[1:19:48] get what I asked for
[1:19:51] we don't go to God wishing and hoping we
[1:19:55] go believing that God is
[1:19:59] and what we are to realize Harlan when
[1:20:03] you see the revelation of God you ought
[1:20:06] to see the revelation of who you are in
[1:20:08] God listen real quick you know because
[1:20:19] sometimes we ask God for things but with
[1:20:22] your fidgety oh we can't stay still long
[1:20:24] enough but listen I'm a break-in in the
[1:20:26] middle of those coldness in Jesus Christ
[1:20:28] the same high 55 he says now he's
[1:20:32] talking about a man who gets upset in
[1:20:34] church and they gathered 8 peeples and
[1:20:36] they moved from church to church listen
[1:20:38] what he says he says now but when a man
[1:20:41] will do he will hear a little something
[1:20:44] and keep moving his papers he says well
[1:20:46] now you will never find God moving your
[1:20:50] papers
[1:20:51] God ain't gonna tell you how he wants it
[1:20:57] to be syndicated he wants you to pray
[1:21:02] about seek his face hug and when you
[1:21:05] talk to you you know is him
[1:21:09] see we're overcome
[1:21:11] he says you never find God moving your
[1:21:13] papers you have to move yourself you
[1:21:22] have to move yourself
[1:21:23] oh yeah in the position where God holy
[1:21:27] can't see your thoughts and respond you
[1:21:34] are what your thoughts are
[1:21:36] he says you have to move your thinking
[1:21:38] and get away from reasoning earlier and
[1:21:42] move yourself from your own way of
[1:21:45] thinking to what God thinks so we need
[1:21:49] to ask the question where we go for God
[1:21:51] we're gonna say Lord show me your mind
[1:21:53] in this situation and move my thoughts
[1:21:57] to your thoughts but you know sometimes
[1:22:01] we ask and we believe that it's too much
[1:22:04] so before we acts we doubt because we
[1:22:10] believe is to be
[1:22:12] wasn't even acts if you doubt an already
[1:22:15] the believers mindset hurry we go to God
[1:22:19] with an assurance that he is job had a
[1:22:22] perfect revelation sometimes God would
[1:22:29] allow things just to rise up hidden
[1:22:33] things that are already laying in you
[1:22:35] that you didn't know was there you know
[1:22:37] God listen God told Joe everybody all
[1:22:40] right God told Abraham go walk before me
[1:22:44] and be thou perfect honey he told him to
[1:22:47] go walk and be perfect if God said that
[1:22:50] that meant Abraham could be perfect
[1:22:52] honey
[1:22:53] but look here he said go walk before me
[1:22:55] and be thou perfect honey
[1:22:57] but Abraham didn't know in his walking
[1:23:00] different things were gonna come out of
[1:23:02] him so God took him to that journey so
[1:23:06] he could be perfect honey on the journey
[1:23:08] he found out he was a liar that was
[1:23:14] already lying in there when God told him
[1:23:16] go be perfect on the journey hurry he
[1:23:22] was afraid gave his wife up
[1:23:24] God knew there was an element of fear
[1:23:27] hurry so God had to take him that way to
[1:23:30] get those things out of him so he could
[1:23:33] be perfect like God said and you wonder
[1:23:39] why you going the way you going is
[1:23:41] because God is protecting you we all say
[1:23:50] God four times like these because it's
[1:23:53] gonna show who you really are
[1:24:00] look Church he didn't know then he had
[1:24:05] some fear in him yes I'm lying all that
[1:24:12] was in him when God had already
[1:24:15] pronounced he was the father faith
[1:24:20] whoa boy that ain't no skim milk huh
[1:24:24] God can pronounce something over your
[1:24:27] life already knowing you're going to
[1:24:29] make mistakes already new and you're
[1:24:32] gonna fail but that doesn't change his
[1:24:35] thoughts about you see it's a believers
[1:24:38] mindset child should not change what we
[1:24:43] think and how we think about God listen
[1:24:52] once that came up he had a little
[1:24:56] argument of freaking with like holy
[1:24:59] things I came in the spirit all these
[1:25:01] things coming out of them
[1:25:03] he probably the Bible say he said this
[1:25:05] but I wasn't speaking hypothetically you
[1:25:07] know he probably he thought it was thing
[1:25:09] as a boy I brought you along with me I
[1:25:10] had to bring you all those there in my
[1:25:14] land you will up being harder with
[1:25:15] my people
[1:25:16] I seen you back on board he telling me
[1:25:19] say you go you choose whichever way you
[1:25:21] wanna go
[1:25:21] and God was dealing with him in a way
[1:25:28] that he could be perfect and he was
[1:25:32] Sarah at the same time knowing he
[1:25:35] pronounced it knowing Sarah was going
[1:25:36] down put her in a situation
[1:25:39] oh my church so believers mindset put in
[1:25:43] her situation
[1:25:44] honey that she knew she couldn't bring
[1:25:47] for her child
[1:25:48] she knew she couldn't fulfill that
[1:25:51] promise
[1:25:52] why gotta do things so you'll see it has
[1:25:55] to be him so none of us are giving you
[1:26:00] credit but think about it if she had a
[1:26:03] believers mindset right there the Bible
[1:26:06] like the perfect God said she would have
[1:26:08] waited on God but because she didn't at
[1:26:11] that moment didn't ever believe was mine
[1:26:12] said she gave my husband to another
[1:26:14] woman think about it she gave her hug
[1:26:20] her to another woman and the woman did
[1:26:22] exactly what she wanted to do brought
[1:26:25] for her child
[1:26:26] did she got man
[1:26:29] got mad bullfighting a woman kick out
[1:26:32] all these things and Abraham like she
[1:26:34] like kick out kick out gonna do it and
[1:26:36] he like me you don't want who did this
[1:26:44] people make decisions and didn't blame
[1:26:47] God for I'm sorry let me let me let me
[1:26:51] read this lemma close the church we have
[1:26:54] to we have to look at our journey look
[1:26:56] at our life don't be upset it's God
[1:26:59] perfecting you you go through things
[1:27:02] that seem unbelievable why me but it's
[1:27:06] God perfecting you he's building the
[1:27:10] perfect revelation of who he is to you
[1:27:13] oh my so that when things arise you fall
[1:27:17] back to that thinking again prime
[1:27:21] example Harlan Winkle I've showed his
[1:27:24] head what happened to David David went
[1:27:26] back to his parents thinking he was
[1:27:29] believed was mined said he went back to
[1:27:31] the bear he went back to the lion he
[1:27:33] said you know what you gonna be just
[1:27:35] like this if my god defeated this my God
[1:27:39] will defeat you huh he didn't worry
[1:27:41] about honey
[1:27:42] the paradigm-shifting he stood on his
[1:27:48] perfect revelation of God and then he
[1:27:56] added a limo to it because remember if
[1:27:59] you see who God has he's your God you
[1:28:02] should be able to see who you are in
[1:28:04] that God and by the time David honey
[1:28:07] y'all notice David didn't stop until you
[1:28:09] got in front of Goliath he kept going
[1:28:13] everybody asked him questions how can I
[1:28:15] listen how can I get what's the reward
[1:28:17] who I need to talk to you Bob Loblaw
[1:28:18] holding on finally he got in front of a
[1:28:21] lion cause his mind set his mindset was
[1:28:26] I'm gonna kill this giant before you
[1:28:28] even saw him in his mind Goliath was
[1:28:32] dead what about your colitis
[1:28:35] what's in your mind how long will it
[1:28:39] live how long will you go through it
[1:28:42] hurry
[1:28:42] you need to order your calls hallelujah
[1:28:45] because you're justified in what you're
[1:28:47] asking for
[1:28:54] listen I'm gonna keep going
[1:28:59] it's alright let me tell you people that

[1:30:19] Morita time again I don't wait by God's
[1:30:20] grace this is the way I think Pentecost
[1:30:24] fail now I'm challenging your mindset
[1:30:27] where you are and no doubt we may have
[1:30:30] some family members who got sick and
[1:30:31] everything but that doesn't change who
[1:30:34] God is
[1:30:40] he may want to get that person in a
[1:30:42] position so they can repent and let you
[1:30:48] lead them to Christ he said the God will
[1:30:51] never you can never exhaust God's love
[1:30:55] and mercy to you you say well I hate to
[1:30:58] bother you so you so much father he
[1:31:01] wants to be bothered

[1:31:22] say once we buy that where he does don't
[1:31:24] never think that you can exhaust earlier
[1:31:26] too much of God he said I believe the
[1:31:29] scripture says you have not because you
[1:31:30] ask not and you act not because you
[1:31:33] believe that he wants us to act and
[1:31:36] believe that how Joyce would be fool he
[1:31:39] wants you to act abundantly not catch
[1:31:42] this 100 he says acts for big things
[1:31:46] when was the last time you challenged
[1:31:49] your very own faith we were the last
[1:31:52] time you ordered your calls because you
[1:31:55] knew you were justified in what you were
[1:31:57] asking for like somebody chose their
[1:32:02] birthdays all that preachers on the
[1:32:04] pandemic and stuff you better be careful
[1:32:06] I am you can't tell I'm still serving
[1:32:08] them you better be careful I am I'm
[1:32:13] still under the blood he said ask for
[1:32:23] big things he says don't limit your
[1:32:26] faith how do you live in your faith with
[1:32:28] your mind he says no living your faith
[1:32:33] to some little mustard seed oh you know
[1:32:37] how we do his believers all I need is
[1:32:39] mothers evening he says get on out there
[1:32:44] hallelujah he said get out here to some
[1:32:47] other kind of faith and move out to big
[1:32:50] teams he says oh my little spy he says
[1:32:53] big things is just as easy to receive as
[1:32:57] little things hooray
[1:33:02] so you think about your mind next time
[1:33:04] huh he says you just have to believe
[1:33:07] that's all come on musicians you just
[1:33:10] have to believe that's all and you got
[1:33:12] faith just know exactly how to use it
[1:33:15] honey then it will be all right you can
[1:33:17] put it right to work and it'll just be
[1:33:20] fine
[1:33:21] put that put job 13 back up for me
[1:33:23] brother in the midst of us battling 13
[1:33:32] and 18 in the midst of us battling and
[1:33:35] and serving the Lord I want y'all to
[1:33:38] remember the scripture behold now I have
[1:33:42] ordered my calls and I know that I shall
[1:33:45] be justified that God has justified the
[1:33:53] believer according to their faith so
[1:33:56] when you act you act in believing that
[1:33:59] God is Joe got a perfect revelation of
[1:34:03] God knowing who he was and like I said
[1:34:06] earlier once you get the revelation of
[1:34:09] God it's as always it's just it should
[1:34:12] also show you who you are that's why the
[1:34:19] prophet of God could make statements
[1:34:21] like when a brother was challenging him
[1:34:22] and say you just don't know your body
[1:34:24] says but I do know our real well
[1:34:30] Church let's have a believers mindset
[1:34:32] those brothers I didn't get a chance to
[1:34:35] get all the way into it but those
[1:34:36] brothers didn't stop - they got their
[1:34:39] brother in the presence of God no matter
[1:34:42] what it took hallelujah look they had to
[1:34:45] tear up the roof and you better believe
[1:34:46] it was a believers house cuz you ego
[1:34:51] going on believer house and care they
[1:34:53] roof
[1:34:54] Holly - might you want to put him in the
[1:34:55] presence of Jesus had to be believable
[1:34:57] say praise God praise God holy the
[1:35:01] supernatural was demonstrated in my
[1:35:02] house tonight
[1:35:03] praise God Jesus looked at him and say
[1:35:09] man you heal get up the believers mind
[1:35:15] said cousin I also want to read Joshua
[1:35:18] when Joshua was in the middle of the
[1:35:20] fight he's standing there fighting the
[1:35:21] enemy and the Sun is going down
[1:35:23] he's fighting in the Sun his movies
[1:35:25] fighting now look at his mind he knows
[1:35:27] if the enemy gets away he's gonna have a
[1:35:29] chance to regroup hurry
[1:35:31] so in his mind he was thinking honey
[1:35:34] what did God tell me God told me nothing
[1:35:38] will be able to stand before me not even
[1:35:43] the Sun Wow tell about the enemy we talk
[1:35:47] about the Sun the Sun had you obeyed
[1:35:50] Joshua because God told him nothing to
[1:35:53] be able to stand before you and look at
[1:35:57] this Commission Church we need to go
[1:35:59] back to our Commission he told Joshua be
[1:36:02] strong and very courageous why did he
[1:36:04] tell him that because God was getting
[1:36:06] them ready to fight
[1:36:08] how many times do you tell at least two
[1:36:11] or three times only bees out strong and
[1:36:14] very courageous if you listen close
[1:36:16] gotta tell you harder when the battle is
[1:36:19] coming and Joshua gets a hug and he
[1:36:25] ordered his girls hallelujah because he
[1:36:29] knew he was justified so he said son
[1:36:31] stand out still moon kneeling over the
[1:36:33] valley of agilar he ordered his cause
[1:36:36] and the whole thing Stood Still what
[1:36:44] happened the Sun and the moon huh
[1:36:48] creation heard from God again why
[1:36:52] because Joshua remembered what God told
[1:36:55] you and I guarantee you whatever
[1:36:59] standing in front of you when you can
[1:37:02] get your mind right and you speak with
[1:37:05] the mind of God that whatever sinful you
[1:37:08] will hear God when you speak let's pray
[1:37:12] Lord Jesus father we thank you Lord
[1:37:15] wouldn't mean to be so long Lord but I

[1:37:29] even when we don't know what's next Lord
[1:37:31] in the midst of perilous times Lord but
[1:37:34] it's a glorious time for a believer

[1:37:43] sidetracked in the midst of this
[1:37:45] paradigm Lord as we approach let us

[1:37:51] same genuine faith that Joshua had the
[1:37:54] same genuine faith that Joe had Lord a
[1:37:58] believers my incentive always thank you

[1:39:02] completely to you
[1:39:06] oh yes fill me with your thoughts make
[1:39:14] it all brand new and it won't change my
[1:39:18] life
[1:39:21] and let me leave it all that's true I
[1:39:28] just wanted a man Wow that was I just
[1:39:46] just hearing just has he's referring to
[1:39:51] Abraham to job to David I don't know I
[1:39:54] feel like I could take any more of those
[1:39:56] and just preach a whole sermon right now
[1:39:58] my brother digs that was quite
[1:40:00] incredible you know I I appreciated so
[1:40:03] much of what he had to say just right
[1:40:06] almost from the beginning some of my
[1:40:09] favorite points can I give you just a
[1:40:11] few of my favorites
[1:40:13] you know shifting times reveals the real
[1:40:16] you reveals the real you and I you know
[1:40:21] I've always said for the cadre the worst
[1:40:25] kind of deception the self deception
[1:40:30] y'all heard me say that for years that's
[1:40:33] the worst kind of deception is self
[1:40:35] deception and I have said you know Jesus
[1:40:39] tells about how that children of the
[1:40:43] darkness run away from the light because
[1:40:46] it exposes their evil deeds and they
[1:40:48] don't like that but a real child of God
[1:40:52] runs to the light because he wants to be
[1:40:55] exposed I don't want to be embarrassed
[1:40:57] in front of the world but I want to know
[1:40:59] who the real me is and I got a problem
[1:41:03] Lord I want to know it don't leave me
[1:41:05] thinking I'm okay because what will
[1:41:09] happen is some shifting times something
[1:41:12] will happen and you won't have the faith
[1:41:15] that you need that you thought you had
[1:41:17] and God God sends these challenges into
[1:41:22] our lives to see
[1:41:25] we are and I that brother brother Diggs
[1:41:30] said that and I wrote my own little note
[1:41:32] under that you know we are really the
[1:41:35] ones who need to know
[1:41:36] I mean God already knows God seems these
[1:41:39] challenges not to know something he
[1:41:41] don't know but you're the one needs to
[1:41:43] know I need to know where I wear it my
[1:41:46] real faith is oh my god note after note
[1:41:50] after note after note wow that was so
[1:41:55] amazing you know about how that God
[1:42:00] ordered and blew my mind
[1:42:04] God ordered Abraham's life in order to
[1:42:08] for Abraham to match the vision God
[1:42:11] already had of him and said whoa before
[1:42:14] me and be perfect and here Abraham had
[1:42:16] all these ticking time bombs walking
[1:42:19] around with all these problems and
[1:42:20] weaknesses and God just simply led his
[1:42:22] life to uncover every one of them so I
[1:42:25] could blow up so Abraham could deal with
[1:42:27] it I just say Lord whatever it takes by
[1:42:29] whatever means necessary lead my life
[1:42:32] don't let me have these ticking time
[1:42:34] bombs I won't rid of them I don't want
[1:42:35] to blow up and they'll blow up just when
[1:42:37] you least expect it and when you really
[1:42:40] don't need it a bomb to go off that's
[1:42:43] when it'll happen so I just say Lord
[1:42:45] lead me by your word amen and David I
[1:42:53] never saw David I've never caught that
[1:42:57] that David you know come on let's be
[1:43:01] honest a lot of times we we talk a big
[1:43:05] talk why we're maneuvering to not have
[1:43:08] to face it David actually already had
[1:43:12] made a determination I'm gonna kill that
[1:43:13] guy and he he commenced to moving from
[1:43:17] person to person to person till he got
[1:43:19] to the king even had to go to the
[1:43:21] humiliation his brothers attacked him
[1:43:23] attacked his character accused him of a
[1:43:26] false motive David only had one motive
[1:43:28] on to kill this unbeliever yeah
[1:43:29] Navy didn't care what anybody thought
[1:43:31] this man has defied the armies of the
[1:43:34] Living God he's got a Keith gotta gotta
[1:43:36] die yeah and David went from person to
[1:43:39] person to person facing an impossible
[1:43:41] task and kept going through the King
[1:43:44] through everybody until he got where he
[1:43:46] wanted to be in front of Goliath Wow
[1:43:52] that rocked my world I don't think I've
[1:43:56] made a note to myself this angle may be
[1:43:58] the best story of faith I've ever heard
[1:44:00] so many of you know how that that David
[1:44:05] pressed pressed because he already knew
[1:44:10] what he was gonna do that was fantastic
[1:44:16] [Applause]
[1:44:21] Wow more and more I can keep going on
[1:44:24] I'd have to reap reach his sermon those
[1:44:26] quotes were fantastic brother I love
[1:44:29] that he had a grip on God his revelation
[1:44:32] was a grip on God amen we've got some
[1:44:37] prayer requests let me get to these
[1:44:38] before I just keep going on and on get
[1:44:42] where I need to be sister haylie we had
[1:44:45] prayed for a patient of hers and and so
[1:44:49] she's asking she says can I put another
[1:44:51] question for one of my patients his
[1:44:53] surgery went very well
[1:44:55] I thought but he's still in a lot of
[1:44:58] pain and asks for prayer and she says
[1:45:01] same patient as last time so we want to
[1:45:05] pray for that brother dawn gurgle writes
[1:45:09] in to say please pray for a 17 year old
[1:45:14] named Rosalynn she was taken to Hilton
[1:45:18] Head Hospital late this afternoon after
[1:45:20] throwing up blood and going unconscious
[1:45:21] her vitals are stable but she's still
[1:45:24] unconscious

[1:45:27] anoint the medical staff there to
[1:45:30] administer the correct procedures to
[1:45:33] make her well again

[1:45:44] for reading tonight amen praise the Lord

[1:45:52] standing and trying to observe our
[1:45:58] testimony and so we'll take these
[1:46:04] requests to the Lord you have a need you
[1:46:07] want to make make known to God by an
[1:46:10] uplifted hand Wow let's pray lord I feel
[1:46:17] so inspired by the word I heard tonight
[1:46:19] my goodness Lord my heart is on fire
[1:46:23] with faith to think of these things as
[1:46:25] your servant just went through the
[1:46:27] scripture and took us on a journey
[1:46:29] through the Bible took us on a journey
[1:46:31] and brings in the things our prophet had
[1:46:34] to say about it to just seal it Lord
[1:46:36] it's impossible to disbelieve right now
[1:46:40] Lord I'm believing for this need that
[1:46:43] sister Hayley writes in I'm believing
[1:46:45] father that this person will know
[1:46:48] immediate relief Lord because we're
[1:46:50] requesting it of thee that this young
[1:46:52] woman Lord will know immediate relief
[1:46:54] but we're bringing it before you we're
[1:46:56] asking Lord and we're believing father
[1:46:59] in our heart tonight I'm praying a
[1:47:01] prayer because I'm sending it and I
[1:47:04] believe you'll answer it Lord
[1:47:06] father I believe we're arriving at that
[1:47:08] time where we've got to we've got to
[1:47:11] call it out Lord according to your word
[1:47:13] and stand on it and believe it and
[1:47:14] confess it is done Granite Lord tonight
[1:47:18] meet both of these needs and hands that
[1:47:21] went up Lord across the audience and out
[1:47:23] through Lord the across the airwaves no
[1:47:26] doubt father needs tonight I'm believing
[1:47:28] for every one of them
[1:47:30] Lord Jesus there's other things in my
[1:47:33] heart and thou knowest things to be
[1:47:35] praying about and I'm believing for
[1:47:36] every one of them may you grant these
[1:47:39] things tonight Lord Lord let it be that
[1:47:43] these kinds of sermons Lord for such a
[1:47:46] time as this such an hour
[1:47:49] we're facing Lord when the enemy comes
[1:47:51] in like a flood we're to race we're to
[1:47:54] rate we're the standard we raised
[1:47:55] ourselves up to combat him in prayer and
[1:47:58] faith Lord
[1:47:59] so we're believing father I want it to
[1:48:02] be in coming days when the enemy comes
[1:48:04] in we'll remember the words the
[1:48:06] challenges the admonitions the
[1:48:08] instructions that we heard tonight I
[1:48:12] pray master that you'll grant these
[1:48:15] things to us we commit it to you in
[1:48:18] Jesus name Amen you know it but the digs
[1:48:25] when he is preaching along you know it
[1:48:30] the closest thing that I as far as like
[1:48:33] when you hear brother Diggs talking
[1:48:34] about his confession
[1:48:35] the closest thing that I read about that
[1:48:40] is if you read the testimony of brother
[1:48:44] Bosworth he was like that because people
[1:48:47] can say oh you better be careful
[1:48:48] confessing all that the devil is gonna
[1:48:50] make you prove it
[1:48:51] brother Bosworth had that kind of
[1:48:52] mentality that you heard tonight and he
[1:48:54] had it as into our life and died an old
[1:48:56] man in perfect health
[1:48:58] and it wasn't that the devil didn't
[1:49:00] attack him the devil attacked him
[1:49:01] constantly tried to make him sick many
[1:49:03] times the you know people could say I
[1:49:05] was sitting there thinking as you
[1:49:06] appreciate those days people could say
[1:49:08] who don't know the story and could say
[1:49:12] all that preaching better be careful you
[1:49:14] know
[1:49:15] never might strike him with cancer brain
[1:49:17] tumors so like hey devil already did
[1:49:19] and the devil already got defeated say
[1:49:22] well he might you might better be
[1:49:23] careful you might get struck with
[1:49:24] blindness that's already been tried man
[1:49:26] with stone blind and confessed his way
[1:49:29] out of it and sees clearly I'm here to
[1:49:32] take some friends listen you'll never go
[1:49:34] wrong confessing the word of Almighty
[1:49:36] God and standing on it and believing
[1:49:40] that I say this that it it has been good
[1:49:45] to be in the house of God
[1:49:49] blessed be the name of the Lord let's
