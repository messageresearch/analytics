[45:37] Wednesday night amen all right uh Romans
[45:41] chapter 5 and Noah what did I send back
[45:44] there starting at 12 I think yeah I
[45:46] think so yeah verse 12 we'll catch 12
[45:48] through
[45:52] 21 oh this is such a beautiful reading
[45:55] here Paul
[45:58] speaking wherefore he's going to explain
[46:01] how you ended up freeing Christ and it
[46:05] is so
[46:06] spectacular that only God could pull it
[46:09] off and because God pulled it off
[46:12] there's no power that can undo it I love
[46:15] that even you can't undo
[46:18] it wherefore as by one man sinner sin
[46:22] entered into the world and death by sin
[46:27] and so death passed upon all men for
[46:31] that all have sinned see we were born in
[46:34] sin we came into the world that way now
[46:37] you didn't volunteer to come that way
[46:38] Paul says in another place the creation
[46:41] was subjected to it it's all about his
[46:43] plan it's his plan it's his word it's
[46:46] his church it's his Heaven it's his
[46:47] eternal life it's all about him amen
[46:51] amen so we're just getting in by his
[46:53] divine grace loved us when we were yet
[46:55] sinners brother said it so beautifully
[46:58] one place I heard recently and he's
[47:00] talking about Jesus being a son the Son
[47:03] of God and he said the son became sin so
[47:08] Sinners could become Sons wow and it
[47:12] thrilled brother brandom I think he said
[47:14] I think it hit him fresh because he kept
[47:15] repeating it he was in he got inspired
[47:17] by every time he would say it he said
[47:19] think of that the Son of God became sin
[47:23] so that Sinners could become Sons amen
[47:26] praise the Lord
[47:28] amen that includes you too sisters don't
[47:31] worry amen you just have to tolerate
[47:33] that that sun wording I mean I have to
[47:37] be the
[47:38] bride okay so so we're good all
[47:44] right all
[47:46] right nevertheless yeah for all right
[47:50] verse 13 for until the law sin was in
[47:53] the world but sin is not imputed when
[47:56] there is is no law
[47:58] nevertheless see so you can't disbelieve
[48:01] what you don't know but nevertheless
[48:03] you're still born in sin so you still
[48:05] must be born again right or you can
[48:07] never go to heaven it's impossible
[48:10] because the only life that can be in
[48:12] heaven is Zoe life God's life eternal
[48:14] life and the all that's his life so he
[48:17] can't accept your life he can only
[48:18] accept his life and that's his life
[48:20] living in you and you have Paul said I
[48:23] died and Christ lives I'm a new creation
[48:26] and that easy is't that so beautiful
[48:29] nevertheless all right so people were
[48:32] still born in sin it is true that sin is
[48:35] not imputed when there's no law but
[48:37] nevertheless death reigned from Adam to
[48:40] Moses even over them that had not sinned
[48:42] after the similitude of Adam's
[48:44] transgressions we weren't there in Eden
[48:46] and did that see who is the figure of
[48:49] him that was to come see but because of
[48:52] what happened in the Garden of Eden now
[48:55] we're born in sin
[48:58] see so Paul this is a real conundrum and
[49:01] Paul is really trying to explain what
[49:03] God did about it it's it's brilliant
[49:05] it's just brilliant but not as the
[49:08] offense so also is the free gift for if
[49:12] through the offense of one this was Adam
[49:16] in the Garden of Eden many be dead were
[49:18] born in sin much more the grace of God
[49:22] and the gift by Grace which is by one
[49:24] man Jesus Christ hath abounded to many
[49:27] so what Adam sold us into Jesus bought
[49:30] us out of amen hallelujah amen see Adam
[49:35] stepped into death I remember brother
[49:37] Homer Brown used to always say this he
[49:38] said the problem was with Adam the first
[49:41] Adam is he stepped into death willingly
[49:44] to save his bride Eve he loved her yeah
[49:47] the problem was he got trapped himself
[49:50] when he did that the beauty of the
[49:53] second Adam is that he also became sin
[49:56] and stepped into death but by his own
[49:58] power raised himself back out again and
[50:01] now he has called us up oh Hallelujah my
[50:05] amen oh it's just beautiful it's it's so
[50:09] almost poetry verse
[50:11] 16 and not as it was by one that sins so
[50:16] is the gift see read it again and not as
[50:20] it was by one that sinned so is the gift
[50:23] for the Judgment was by one to condemn
[50:27] to condemnation see he's saying there
[50:30] it's a perfect
[50:32] contrast the the what happened to us
[50:36] under the first adom and where we are
[50:39] under the second Adam stand in perfect
[50:42] contradistinction one to the other see
[50:44] so that's why he's using that language
[50:46] not as it was by one that sinned so is
[50:49] the gift for the Judgment was by one the
[50:53] condemnation but the free gift is of
[50:55] many offense is under justification Adam
[50:58] did one thing and it sold us into sin
[51:01] Christ literally has not has literally
[51:04] not only undid our sin birth but has
[51:07] forgiven all your sins even the ones you
[51:10] haven't yet committed amen amen
[51:14] see for If by one man's offense death
[51:17] Reign by one much more they which
[51:20] receive abundance of grace and the gift
[51:22] of righteousness shall reign in life by
[51:24] one Jesus Christ therefore
[51:27] as by the offense of one judgment Came
[51:30] Upon all men to condemnation even so by
[51:32] the righteousness of one the free gift
[51:35] came upon all men un justification of
[51:37] Life verse 19 for as by one man's
[51:41] Disobedience many were made Sinners so
[51:44] by The Obedience of one shall many be
[51:47] made righteous moreover or in other
[51:50] words if you think that's something
[51:51] listen to this the law entered that the
[51:55] offense might abound
[51:57] so why did God give man his way when he
[52:01] wanted a law cuz that was not God's way
[52:04] you understand that that was an
[52:06] irrational decision Israel made they
[52:08] came out under a prophet and a pillar of
[52:10] fire the presence of the Angel of the
[52:12] Lord among them but they chose a law
[52:15] brother r that wasn't God's choosing
[52:17] that wasn't Moses's choosing see and so
[52:21] so so they they they choose this and so
[52:24] what he's watch what he's saying here
[52:27] but moreover the law entered and God
[52:31] allowed that to prove to them they
[52:34] couldn't keep it yeah amen you cannot
[52:37] convince a man that he needs salvation
[52:40] unless you can first show him he's lost
[52:43] see the the problem is in leoda and
[52:46] you're in our my age is that there's a
[52:49] spirit of delusion on lost people who
[52:51] think they're not
[52:53] lost they say I'm in Rich increas of
[52:55] goods have need of nothing I I'm I'm
[52:57] perfectly fine what they don't realize
[52:59] is they're actually poor and miserable
[53:01] and naked and blind they're blind to the
[53:05] fact that they're poor miserable and
[53:06] naked see so so they don't think they
[53:09] need the word of God they don't think
[53:11] they need a prophet to restore they
[53:12] don't think they need the Holy Ghost
[53:15] they easily dismiss that as to an age
[53:17] gone by see and that's not going to end
[53:20] well for right so that's why we preach
[53:23] that's why we live it amen you good you
[53:27] good I know I still got you standing
[53:28] it's all
[53:30] good verse 20 moreover the law
[53:34] entered that the offense might
[53:37] abound but where sin abounded Grace did
[53:41] much more abound thank you Lorden that
[53:44] as Sin hath reigned unto death even so
[53:47] might grace Reign through righteousness
[53:50] under eternal life by Jesus Christ Our
[53:53] Lord that's never been in question the
[53:56] the question comes how do I get his
[54:00] righteousness that's the question let's
[54:03] pray father we thank you for your word
[54:06] today I thank you for your anointing on
[54:09] the word that we feel we ask your
[54:12] presence to be here Lord and bring forth
[54:15] this word as you have given it to us
[54:18] Lord so much has become even to me Lord
[54:21] even after all these years of study to
[54:23] go over it now Lord it just almost seems
[54:26] to be coming fresh in a away and I I see
[54:30] angles and questions are have been
[54:32] answered in my own heart things I've
[54:34] pondered at for years Lord and so I'm
[54:36] committing it now to you I pray you'll
[54:39] bless it in jesus' name amen God bless
[54:42] you you can be
[54:54] seated now I have a number of statements
[54:57] today and a number of
[54:59] scriptures um that we going to use a
[55:01] number of quotes from brother brandom I
[55:04] decided not to put them on the display
[55:06] because we're going to have so many Noah
[55:08] you're going to get a workout today so
[55:10] we're we're going to just be ready don't
[55:12] do it yet but be ready for Luke
[55:14] 13 all right and then I'll I'll try to
[55:17] give you heads up as we go so I knew I
[55:21] would you know so having kept you
[55:23] standing like that for the reading we're
[55:25] already kind ofe preaching reading at
[55:27] the same time and then uh we've got a
[55:29] number of scriptures we want to read and
[55:31] I want to I want to read some quotes to
[55:34] you but I didn't want to display them
[55:35] because I want sometimes I can be more
[55:38] poignant with the quote if I can just
[55:40] take my time and you just listen to me
[55:42] say it all right you good but we have
[55:46] them in case you uh need to see them no
[55:52] worries my
[55:56] I want to start today with explaining a
[56:01] principle and I'm I'm going to just go
[56:04] ahead because I like to sometimes let
[56:06] you know a little bit of on the back end
[56:10] so that you know where we're going so I
[56:12] so that because a lot of times in when
[56:14] you're really doing some close preacher
[56:16] te teaching preaching um people can hear
[56:19] all of this data and they don't really
[56:21] know okay how does it connect where's it
[56:22] going where what's this about and you
[56:24] get lost in the shule by the time I get
[56:26] to the point you've already forgot all
[56:28] of that so so we're going to try to
[56:31] focus in and I'm going to read it for
[56:33] you here in a little bit but it's
[56:34] familiar to you where brother brandham
[56:36] talks about how that the Bride of the
[56:38] last day she's ordained to stand she
[56:42] won't fall cuz she's
[56:44] predestinated she's ordained to not fall
[56:47] he says that see she and a lot of times
[56:50] we say he said she's predestinated not
[56:52] to fall now it's important that you
[56:55] understand he said she's ordained not to
[56:57] fall she's pred she's ordained to stand
[57:01] but she's pred she won't fall cuz she's
[57:04] predestinated so there's two or three
[57:07] things that you have to look at layer by
[57:09] layer to get the full context of what
[57:12] he's saying and to get the beauty out of
[57:14] it fully is that okay you good you're
[57:16] going to be good so I want you to think
[57:20] about from The Book of Revelation a lot
[57:23] is said and a lot of P pits preach on it
[57:28] uh the beauty in the message is I can
[57:30] promise you you're guaranteed nearly
[57:32] guaranteed to hear things you're not
[57:34] going to hear in the average Sunday
[57:35] morning pull pit um so we like to try to
[57:39] really be very clear and explain
[57:41] ourselves as we go brother Jason that
[57:42] was an amazing Sunday school by the way
[57:45] so so we find that that when you look in
[57:49] the Book of Revelation you have the the
[57:53] the the woman that sat on Seven Hills
[57:57] and she was called uh the Harlot the
[58:01] great Harlot or she was a those
[58:03] are CTIC words that grade on us a little
[58:06] bit we don't like that language but
[58:08] that's Bible language and she had
[58:10] daughters which were harlots okay so now
[58:14] I'm not trying to teach on that today I
[58:17] want to I want to get you to
[58:19] understand what made the great Harlot
[58:23] the great Harlot and what made made her
[58:26] daughters harlots so I want to get you
[58:29] to understand what how that happened cuz
[58:32] they didn't start that way amen you
[58:35] understand so so what how did they get
[58:39] there and how do we avoid falling into
[58:42] that same
[58:44] trap all right so watch so we find that
[58:49] that every one of those daughters let
[58:51] just make this point to
[58:53] you every one of those daughters
[58:56] ERS began as
[59:00] virgins when they were following in the
[59:04] days of their messenger for instance
[59:07] when Martin Luther came on the scene he
[59:10] caught a seal was partially open a
[59:13] mystery dropped down a messenger Luther
[59:15] caught it and started running with it
[59:17] then Eagles started Gathering to the
[59:19] carcass of the word it wasn't the full
[59:21] word it wasn't everything there were
[59:24] things that Luther didn't understand and
[59:26] he got wrong and doctrines he taught
[59:28] wrong but but we read it right here uh
[59:31] concerning that that you know when when
[59:33] there's no law there's no offense so
[59:36] Luther couldn't be condemned for what he
[59:38] didn't know but yet it would have still
[59:41] it would have still been fatal to his
[59:44] movement and to the church had not
[59:47] Christ been seated in the eternity's
[59:49] interceding for ignorance amen see so so
[59:54] he was not going to pour out his full
[59:56] judgment because he could he did not
[59:59] pour out the full word hence he didn't
[1:00:01] hence then Luther's age did not have the
[1:00:05] level of access to the Holy Spirit to be
[1:00:09] on display that you have now it doesn't
[1:00:12] mean the Holy Spirit was cut in half or
[1:00:15] somehow limited you can't take away from
[1:00:17] an eternal being he was still the Holy
[1:00:19] Ghost you understand but but the level
[1:00:23] of display that you can dis play on
[1:00:27] God's behalf is proportional to the
[1:00:30] level of revelation of his word make
[1:00:33] sense these are fundamentals to us so we
[1:00:37] find out that those that that movement
[1:00:39] as a movement you had the Virgin bride
[1:00:43] of Jesus Christ following in that
[1:00:46] movement the just shall live by faith
[1:00:49] but then when the messenger goes away
[1:00:52] and God harvests all of his true bride
[1:00:55] out of that age amen not one of them are
[1:00:59] lost not saying those true virgin
[1:01:01] daughters who followed the message
[1:01:03] became Harless that's not what I'm
[1:01:04] saying God actually took his messenger
[1:01:06] home harvested that crop and moved on to
[1:01:09] the next age and they and the people
[1:01:12] that were left denominated it and then
[1:01:15] it became a seed of
[1:01:17] discrepancy and then there was no more
[1:01:21] there was once it moved to Wesley there
[1:01:24] was no more winking at the ignorance to
[1:01:28] atone for the mistakes if you stayed
[1:01:30] back under that Lutheran
[1:01:33] organization you understand so in order
[1:01:35] to find Redemption now you had to go
[1:01:39] where the intercessory was and so now
[1:01:41] Christ is interceding under the Sixth
[1:01:43] Church age messenger and there's where
[1:01:46] life is because life's always in the
[1:01:48] word does it make sense and so so then
[1:01:51] that movement became Harlot daughters I
[1:01:55] hope I'm clear I'm not saying the
[1:01:57] virgins who followed the word became
[1:01:59] harlots I'm saying as a movement that
[1:02:02] became a movement of Harlot daughters
[1:02:04] spoken of in the Book of
[1:02:05] Revelation the process carried on that
[1:02:08] was true that's how it worked in every
[1:02:09] age then now we're just we're I'm just
[1:02:13] cutting to the chaste so that we can cut
[1:02:14] to the restoration of the brid tree
[1:02:17] which began under Luther I get he was a
[1:02:19] reformer I get it but it was still part
[1:02:22] of the restoration of the brid tree it
[1:02:24] was only the beginning of it all right
[1:02:26] so then you go into Wesley and the exact
[1:02:28] same thing repeats a a seal partially
[1:02:32] opens a mystery drops down a messenger
[1:02:34] catches it runs with it Eagles gather
[1:02:36] around the W the word that they
[1:02:38] understand they still don't have it all
[1:02:40] and Christ is still winking at because
[1:02:42] Wesley's preaching a trinitarian
[1:02:44] doctrine of devils yeah amen amen and so
[1:02:48] Christ is winking at that because he
[1:02:49] hasn't revealed it the open door hasn't
[1:02:51] been set at the end of Philadelphia yet
[1:02:54] once that happens which of course is
[1:02:55] going to to come after Wesley's gone or
[1:02:57] Wesley would have caught that Revelation
[1:02:59] uh but by the time Aza comes around the
[1:03:03] end of the 1800s Wesley's long ago
[1:03:05] passed away and so we find then that
[1:03:08] that that that God harvested his bride
[1:03:11] out of there and then what was left
[1:03:14] denominated it and then that became
[1:03:16] Harlot daughters and then you couldn't
[1:03:18] stay in there anymore to find Redemption
[1:03:20] because Christ was no longer winking at
[1:03:24] at that error that held right you see so
[1:03:28] you're believing seeds of discrepancy
[1:03:31] and when you're holding on to seeds of
[1:03:33] discrepancy if Christ is in the
[1:03:35] eternity's winking at it you can still
[1:03:37] gain Redemption but once he's no longer
[1:03:40] winking at that age and that level of
[1:03:42] ignorance you have to move on walk in
[1:03:45] the light as he's in the light amen make
[1:03:48] sense so then you come to isua the exact
[1:03:51] same thing happens it moves forward the
[1:03:54] open door revelation of Christ they
[1:03:56] begin to understand baptism in Acts 238
[1:03:59] they begin to understand Jesus is in the
[1:04:02] second or third person he's the person
[1:04:05] all right and so so there's where
[1:04:07] Redemption
[1:04:09] is but they still don't have all all the
[1:04:12] all the parts they've got another fold
[1:04:14] of the restoration of the Bride tree but
[1:04:17] they still got to come back the complete
[1:04:19] restoration and this is why we say at
[1:04:22] the very end and for the fourth stage of
[1:04:24] the bride's restor ation it took a
[1:04:27] profit because now it's got to be the
[1:04:30] complete revealing of all the word and
[1:04:34] there can't be any seeds of discrepancy
[1:04:36] in it you understand because now Christ
[1:04:40] is going to step forth from the
[1:04:42] eternities and he's going to open the
[1:04:44] book and he will no longer intercede for
[1:04:47] ignorance you have to repent you have to
[1:04:50] come to the message of your hour if you
[1:04:53] want to be redeemed
[1:04:56] see and so so we I understand that the
[1:05:00] foolish virgin are safe from destruction
[1:05:02] but they're not born again and the
[1:05:04] evidence of that is in Matthew 25 where
[1:05:07] they're standing at the Judgment bar
[1:05:09] being judged so so the whole thing comes
[1:05:12] down to this that there you have to have
[1:05:16] a restoration of the pure word to bring
[1:05:21] forth Redemption it can't have any seeds
[1:05:24] of discrepancy in it because every seed
[1:05:27] will bring forth of its kind and if
[1:05:30] you've got a bride in the last day
[1:05:33] feeding on seeds of
[1:05:35] discrepancy then how is she going to
[1:05:37] become the image that unites with Christ
[1:05:40] and gets a body change how do you think
[1:05:42] that would work it
[1:05:44] wouldn't amen it disconnects it's a
[1:05:47] short circuit see the Capstone has to
[1:05:50] come down on a bride that's honed by the
[1:05:53] word of God and and and in her in her
[1:05:56] flesh life she's not perfect but in her
[1:05:59] faith she's perfect she has a complete
[1:06:04] perfect faith in the revealed word of
[1:06:07] this hour and every promise that it made
[1:06:10] she believes it she says Amen to it her
[1:06:13] life follows through with it and then
[1:06:15] the supernatural can work in her life
[1:06:18] children who've had the token over them
[1:06:20] can be brought back with or without
[1:06:22] their will uh cancers can be dissolved
[1:06:27] the loss can be saved and come it
[1:06:29] doesn't matter God gives the power of
[1:06:32] his word and there's nothing that can
[1:06:34] stop
[1:06:36] it amen certainly not your ups and downs
[1:06:41] and weaknesses in your
[1:06:42] flesh prise God see so we this is why
[1:06:45] brother Brandon say would say you have
[1:06:47] believed the word for your day now we
[1:06:50] already know it's more than just mental
[1:06:52] agreement we've taught on that and not
[1:06:54] preaching on that today
[1:06:56] when we say Amen to the word we're not
[1:06:59] merely talking about mental agreement
[1:07:02] and that would be a boxed in Canyon
[1:07:04] anyway because there's parts of the word
[1:07:06] I promise you're not going to understand
[1:07:09] there's Parts in the word of God that's
[1:07:11] ministers and I've been studying it
[1:07:12] since a boy there's Parts I don't
[1:07:14] understand and puzzle over so it's not
[1:07:17] about that's why that Baptist doctor
[1:07:19] Divinity he said brother brandham until
[1:07:20] we get every last single word and every
[1:07:23] and brother R says goodness gracious
[1:07:24] brother back in the early church fathers
[1:07:27] they were arguing over what a diff thong
[1:07:30] was it's just a little punctuation mark
[1:07:33] how you ever going to get all those
[1:07:34] heads together and agree on every word
[1:07:36] you you've got to bring forth the word
[1:07:38] that come under the under the breaking
[1:07:40] of the seals and that you say well how
[1:07:42] do I know which one that is God will
[1:07:44] vindicate it and he has he did and we're
[1:07:47] Witnesses of it and he didn't just
[1:07:50] vindicate it in the 60s he's vindicating
[1:07:52] it in
[1:07:53] 2024 that's the thing that you from the
[1:07:56] grip of the enemy and has made you love
[1:07:58] God the way you
[1:08:03] do so so they went from Virgin to harlot
[1:08:07] over
[1:08:09] time they became Harlot daughters once
[1:08:12] the Founding Father of the movement was
[1:08:14] gone it became a completely ill-famed
[1:08:16] woman now that's what Revelation shows
[1:08:19] us that's not me making that up that's
[1:08:20] not brother Brandon making it up so when
[1:08:22] brother Brandon refers to the bride at
[1:08:24] the end time time being ordained not to
[1:08:29] fall because she's
[1:08:31] predestinated it it does not mean magic
[1:08:35] powder gets sprinkled on her come on or
[1:08:39] the angel of the Lord holding a knife to
[1:08:41] her
[1:08:42] throat that that's not why she's
[1:08:44] ordained to not fall amen she's not
[1:08:48] predestinated because of magic powder or
[1:08:50] a knife being held to her throat you you
[1:08:52] get me see so all right Noah give me
[1:08:56] give me Luke 133 let's go 18 to
[1:08:59] 21 Jesus speaking here then said he unto
[1:09:05] what is the kingdom of God likee and
[1:09:07] where unto shall I resemble it what am I
[1:09:11] going to show it to be verse 19 it is
[1:09:15] like a grain of mustard seed which a man
[1:09:17] took and cast into his garden and it
[1:09:20] grew and waxed a great tree and the
[1:09:22] fowls of the air lodged in its branches
[1:09:25] and the branches of it now later on in
[1:09:28] the Book of Revelation we're going to
[1:09:31] find out that that that that that little
[1:09:36] seed that grew into a tree ended up
[1:09:39] being the Roman Catholic Church system
[1:09:42] and the fowls of the air that Lodge in
[1:09:44] the branches are demon Spirits that's
[1:09:47] what Revelation Book of Revelation is
[1:09:48] going to show it's going to connect what
[1:09:49] Jesus is saying here so you understand
[1:09:53] that Jesus talks about
[1:09:56] the kingdoms of this world you remember
[1:09:58] is it Luke 4 where the enemy took Jesus
[1:10:01] up and showed him uh all all the
[1:10:04] kingdoms of this
[1:10:06] world see and so you know there there's
[1:10:10] references to that in the scripture
[1:10:12] where you have the kingdoms of this
[1:10:13] world but Jesus isn't talking about that
[1:10:15] now he comes to Matthew 13 and and here
[1:10:19] we're in Luke 13 but in Matthew 13 he
[1:10:21] really begins to to to cabbage down to
[1:10:24] say now the kingdom of heaven so now
[1:10:26] he's talking about a church and we're
[1:10:29] we're we're realizing in Matthew 13 this
[1:10:32] is why Matthew 13 plays out all seven
[1:10:34] Church ages so spectacularly and they
[1:10:37] correlate to the Book of Revelation
[1:10:40] through chapters 2 and three of the
[1:10:42] church ages and so so he starts so we
[1:10:46] find out that when that happens I
[1:10:48] remember when my grandchildren when I
[1:10:50] was you know coaxing them to uh read the
[1:10:53] church age book and I remember Uriah
[1:10:55] just a small guy probably 10 or 11 years
[1:10:57] old and he's starting to read it and he
[1:11:00] I remember we're writing one day I maybe
[1:11:02] i' picked him up from school I don't
[1:11:04] remember and he's he's reading and he's
[1:11:07] go and he stops for a minute I can see
[1:11:08] his mind is thinking and he says so Papa
[1:11:12] let me get this
[1:11:13] straight so there were two
[1:11:18] churches and one was true and one was
[1:11:22] false in the in the early age I said
[1:11:24] yeah and he goes and the false one lied
[1:11:28] and said they were the true one and that
[1:11:30] the true one was the false one I said
[1:11:33] exactly he goes I get
[1:11:36] it and because because that's when you
[1:11:38] read the book of Revelation you realize
[1:11:40] he's speaking that there are two Vines
[1:11:43] growing within the framework of the
[1:11:45] Christian Church the spirit of Christ
[1:11:47] the seed of Christ the word of Christ
[1:11:49] and the Antichrist which are the seeds
[1:11:51] of discrepancy see and they start out
[1:11:54] very small remember when it was um not
[1:11:59] um not baalism bism but uh the whole
[1:12:02] thing of the Deeds of the nicians that
[1:12:05] Prophet says you know when that started
[1:12:07] out it it was just a little saying it
[1:12:09] you know just started in somebody's mind
[1:12:12] and he said it sounded
[1:12:14] reasonable I mean it's reasonable yeah
[1:12:16] we do need to kind of be a little more
[1:12:18] organized we need to put everything we
[1:12:20] believe and it needs to be written down
[1:12:21] on paper and and we need to have a
[1:12:24] hierarchical order of things so that we
[1:12:25] can keep check it sounds
[1:12:27] sensible but it was the little small
[1:12:30] mustard seeds of the Roman Catholic
[1:12:33] Church what it would that would take
[1:12:35] hundreds of years to become that but by
[1:12:38] the time it gets to Nia at 3:25 it's
[1:12:42] completely rejecting the original
[1:12:44] teaching of the
[1:12:45] Apostles amen you still with me all
[1:12:49] right if I see your ears smoking I'll
[1:12:51] know I have to slow down a little
[1:12:53] bit so so we realized verse verse verse
[1:12:57] 20 and again he said wherein to shall I
[1:13:01] liken the kingdom of God it is like
[1:13:04] leaven which a woman a woman represents
[1:13:07] a church in the Bible took and hit three
[1:13:10] measures of meal father son Holy
[1:13:13] Ghost ancient Babylonian
[1:13:18] polytheism and hid it till the and and
[1:13:21] hid it in three measures of meal till
[1:13:23] the whole was leavened till finally when
[1:13:26] you get to to NAA then they they are no
[1:13:30] longer using acts 238 baptism they're no
[1:13:33] longer understanding that that Christ is
[1:13:36] not a second person of the godhead he's
[1:13:39] the person see so so when this when this
[1:13:43] happens you you you're going to
[1:13:46] understand now what brother Brandon
[1:13:48] brought to us beginning uh you know um
[1:13:53] you know he talks about the seed of the
[1:13:55] word Jesus called the word a seed the
[1:13:57] gospel is a seed and it's good seed see
[1:14:00] if you plant it in good ground it'll
[1:14:01] grow uh and and so Jesus talked about
[1:14:05] sometimes it gets planted and it doesn't
[1:14:07] it find it goes by the wayside which is
[1:14:09] the person who hears it it means nothing
[1:14:11] to them and they come to church for
[1:14:13] because it's Christmas or Easter or
[1:14:15] whatever or you know they they got a a
[1:14:18] friend that brought them to church and
[1:14:20] it doesn't mean anything to them and he
[1:14:22] says the and when they get outside then
[1:14:24] the fs of the air come and the Devils
[1:14:26] the demons has come and take that seed
[1:14:28] of the Gospel away from them and they
[1:14:30] just go on like they were never there
[1:14:32] see and then but then sometimes it falls
[1:14:34] on on Stony ground which is not a ground
[1:14:37] with a bunch of stones in it it's it's
[1:14:40] ground that is actually Rock Solid Rock
[1:14:44] and there's a little veneer of grass or
[1:14:47] Moss with a little bit of soil growing
[1:14:49] over the top of it you don't know it's
[1:14:51] rock until you try to plant something in
[1:14:53] it and you get a sh Trel and you dig one
[1:14:56] inch and that's as far as you go see and
[1:14:58] so Jesus said you know that that that
[1:15:01] kind here's the gospel and oh my
[1:15:03] goodness greatest thing I ever heard yes
[1:15:05] I want the freedom people a lot of times
[1:15:07] want to reprieve from sin they want a
[1:15:10] little break so they can breathe some
[1:15:12] clean air for a while kind of get their
[1:15:14] life right sided again but it but but
[1:15:18] but he says you know but because it it h
[1:15:20] it has no depth it can't really put down
[1:15:23] Roots into the Rock and so when the
[1:15:26] sunlight of
[1:15:27] persecution and too many things they
[1:15:29] have to give up that they didn't no one
[1:15:31] told them about and they realize what
[1:15:34] it's going to mean because it didn't put
[1:15:36] any Roots down that persecution and that
[1:15:38] hardship of the gospel because they
[1:15:40] weren't born again and when you're not
[1:15:41] the gospel seems
[1:15:43] hard then then they wither see they
[1:15:46] first they are none with
[1:15:48] joy but there's a difference in wanting
[1:15:50] a reprieve and wanting a
[1:15:52] Deliverance see wanting to be changed
[1:15:55] so then you go and Jesus talks about the
[1:15:57] gospel seed Falls among thorns and it
[1:16:00] grows up it's pretty good ground the
[1:16:02] problem is that it stays in the it stays
[1:16:07] in the cares of the world and it tries
[1:16:09] to live its life in the cares of the
[1:16:11] world and the sins and the things that
[1:16:13] go on it won't break its associations it
[1:16:16] won't give up its social standing it
[1:16:18] won't it won't make the changes it needs
[1:16:20] it loves to have that mingling has likes
[1:16:22] to have one foot in the social
[1:16:24] acceptance and one foot in the gospel
[1:16:26] and what ends up happening is this
[1:16:28] social acceptance chokes the the wheat
[1:16:31] seed out and it can't never bring forth
[1:16:34] fruitful Life of Christ and so the the
[1:16:37] end of that doesn't end well either it
[1:16:39] gets you with the the branches that
[1:16:41] don't bring forth are heun off and cast
[1:16:43] into the fire now I and I'm going to
[1:16:46] just say some of them are go to their
[1:16:48] Eternal destruction that way but can I
[1:16:50] also say today and I'm not preaching on
[1:16:52] it I'm not going to prove what I'm about
[1:16:54] to say cuz I'm not preaching on it but
[1:16:56] but do you realize that sometime and I
[1:16:58] will just refer you to one scripture to
[1:17:00] give you something to think about that
[1:17:02] that that the scripture makes reference
[1:17:05] at the end time to God's true family
[1:17:10] yes amen
[1:17:13] amen but some of some of them build with
[1:17:16] gold and silver and precious stones and
[1:17:20] when the fiery atmospheres and trials
[1:17:22] and Insanity of the end times come
[1:17:25] they're able to stand see Jesus taught
[1:17:28] another place they're built on a rock
[1:17:30] they're not built on sinking sand which
[1:17:32] is a little broader term because that's
[1:17:34] what unbelievers do but but now he's
[1:17:36] talk he's more narrowly focused on
[1:17:38] people who are good people because some
[1:17:40] of them build on wood hay and stubble
[1:17:43] and when the fiery Trials of Leota come
[1:17:46] and The Temptations are so great and the
[1:17:49] insanity is so rampid that what ends up
[1:17:52] happening it burns down everything in
[1:17:54] their life now un fortunately they
[1:17:56] themselves are
[1:17:58] saved but they lose everything they've
[1:18:01] done and everything they've built and
[1:18:02] everything they chased and pursued it
[1:18:05] gets consumed by the fire of the last
[1:18:09] day all and that's why Jesus said buy of
[1:18:12] me gold tried in the
[1:18:15] fire anoint your eyes with isap put on
[1:18:18] the garments of righteousness that's the
[1:18:20] only way you'll be able to stand cuz I'm
[1:18:23] not I'm not only interested in being a a
[1:18:27] a Son of God I want to be a
[1:18:29] Victorious Son of God I want my life to
[1:18:33] count for something I want to know that
[1:18:36] I put my shoulder to the wheel and that
[1:18:39] I help push and on the other side I'll
[1:18:41] raise my hands with the millions and
[1:18:44] we'll sing the songs of
[1:18:47] Zion thank you Lord little sidebar you
[1:18:50] good everybody breathe it's okay we
[1:18:54] going to car
[1:18:59] on so so you're learning a concept about
[1:19:03] the life that's in the
[1:19:05] seed when you plant a certain seed now
[1:19:09] I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to
[1:19:10] correlate the kingdom of heaven and
[1:19:12] because Jesus is talking about seeds
[1:19:14] they planted a mustard seed they took
[1:19:16] meal and put it in three measures and
[1:19:18] the whole lump got contaminated so we're
[1:19:20] taught where Jesus was connecting the
[1:19:22] natural to the spiritual so you're with
[1:19:23] me
[1:19:25] so you can understand how we got to
[1:19:27] where we are so here's a here's the
[1:19:29] first principle that when you plant seed
[1:19:32] in the ground that seed will only grow
[1:19:36] the crop that it was intended to grow
[1:19:39] according to the life that was in the
[1:19:41] seed you planted right amen so you can't
[1:19:45] plant the seeds of an orange tree and
[1:19:48] hope to grow apples right there's no
[1:19:51] chance that can happen amen see so so we
[1:19:55] find that that this is rightly so uh
[1:19:58] because the word of God was a seed of
[1:20:01] life and all creation see God how did
[1:20:05] the world get get seated God
[1:20:08] spoke and his word was his seed that
[1:20:11] multiplied it fell into the womb of the
[1:20:14] earth and it grew it spawned a whole
[1:20:16] universe you understand so so children
[1:20:21] come into the world because men pass
[1:20:23] seed into the womb of a female and that
[1:20:26] gestates and brings forth a living child
[1:20:29] and that's why brother brandham said the
[1:20:30] natural birth is far more mysterious
[1:20:32] than the than the Virgin birth because
[1:20:34] the Virgin birth was God overshadowing a
[1:20:37] virgin God can do anything but how does
[1:20:39] a human man come together with a human
[1:20:41] woman and produce another human see and
[1:20:43] it's they can understand the science
[1:20:45] they understand the mechanics of that
[1:20:47] and they can even treat it when things
[1:20:49] go wrong but they don't understand that
[1:20:51] secret of life that's what they can't
[1:20:54] get get their mind around because that's
[1:20:56] reserved only God can give life
[1:20:59] see you can't you didn't get your own
[1:21:02] life and you can't keep your own life
[1:21:04] you can try to exercise Eat Right
[1:21:05] improve your quality of life but you
[1:21:08] can't keep breath in your lungs God has
[1:21:10] to do that see so so you're really
[1:21:14] that's why the Bible says let everything
[1:21:16] that has breath praise the Lord but not
[1:21:18] your Thief see you're breathing air and
[1:21:22] you're not praising the Lord with it
[1:21:25] so M I'm going much slower than I wanted
[1:21:27] to but I think it's necessary you can
[1:21:29] see why we're at part
[1:21:32] 14 so so I I want to make that clear
[1:21:38] God produced God's seed that produced
[1:21:42] life was his words amen see and that's
[1:21:45] what it'll go back to that's why Jesus
[1:21:47] would talk about you know whose wife
[1:21:49] whose husband he said you do Heir in the
[1:21:52] scripture they're neither married nor
[1:21:53] given in marriage it doesn't come like
[1:21:55] that certainly not among the redeemed
[1:21:57] family who are in glorified bodies like
[1:21:59] his now I don't I don't not answering
[1:22:01] about everything else that's in the
[1:22:02] Millennium I've got some thoughts on
[1:22:04] that we're not preaching on that today
[1:22:05] as well so I'm just trying to keep you
[1:22:08] focused on this fact that God's original
[1:22:10] word created a perfect world God's
[1:22:13] original word will always create
[1:22:16] Perfection as long as you don't mess
[1:22:18] with it as long as you don't tamper with
[1:22:20] it or hinder it see so so now now you
[1:22:25] say brother Jason what what are you
[1:22:26] aiming at I'm trying to get us to
[1:22:30] understand the value that God sent a
[1:22:33] message with the original word again
[1:22:37] because we're trying to get to a body
[1:22:39] change we're trying to get back to
[1:22:41] eternal life so he set his Eternal Word
[1:22:44] it's not a partial word it's not
[1:22:46] something that could that's going to
[1:22:48] convert from Virgin to harlot it's it's
[1:22:51] going to stay virgin and it's going to
[1:22:52] leave the Earth in a body chain
[1:22:55] so this is why we say God sent a prophet
[1:22:57] and you need to get that you need to
[1:22:59] understand that you need to feed on that
[1:23:01] because the gospel that come in the
[1:23:04] message is a seed it's your vitamins to
[1:23:06] help you grow to be a real
[1:23:09] Christian see so all right so God said
[1:23:13] let there be and there was so God's
[1:23:15] original word created a perfect word all
[1:23:17] right so so to be certain that we did
[1:23:22] not miss this
[1:23:25] fundamentally oh an important principle
[1:23:28] is an understatement so so so that we
[1:23:31] don't lose sight of that of what I'm
[1:23:34] saying here and what I've been saying
[1:23:36] for the last 25 minutes is that the Lord
[1:23:39] would have his Prophet to take two
[1:23:42] exhaustive sermons to preach a message
[1:23:46] titled the spoken word is the Original
[1:23:50] Seed because the lessons in that are are
[1:23:53] are so vital for us to understand this
[1:23:57] is once you understand that the spoken
[1:23:59] word is Original Seed you can see why
[1:24:03] that a Shepherd who loves you would
[1:24:06] become alarmed if I see you feeding on
[1:24:09] seeds that might have some truth in it
[1:24:12] but also be intermingled with seeds of
[1:24:15] discrepancy say well how do I know it
[1:24:17] would have discrepancy if it's not the
[1:24:19] original word it has discrepancy there's
[1:24:22] only the original pure word or not
[1:24:25] see so so this is how we've got today
[1:24:29] north of
[1:24:31] 33,000 different
[1:24:34] denominations and interpretations of a
[1:24:36] single book
[1:24:39] see so brother bram's challenge to those
[1:24:42] to those Pentecostals who thought they
[1:24:44] had the message of restoration they
[1:24:45] denominated prove they didn't they had a
[1:24:47] part of it but they didn't follow on to
[1:24:50] know the Lord as the Bible says we shall
[1:24:52] know if we follow on to know the Lord
[1:24:55] so brother Brandon's challenge was that
[1:24:57] if and this was a simple challenge I
[1:24:59] love the fact that when you get a
[1:25:01] hillbilly challenge you're stuck because
[1:25:03] you're not going to get around it
[1:25:04] because it's just too simple and shallow
[1:25:06] to argue against see so hillbilly
[1:25:08] challenge is one of the
[1:25:10] most Ironclad challenges you can get all
[1:25:13] right and there's all kinds of saying
[1:25:15] that came out of the hills that
[1:25:16] everybody says them we go man that just
[1:25:18] makes sense all right so here was
[1:25:21] brother brenham's hillbilly point that
[1:25:24] that that that if if one false word in
[1:25:29] Genesis broke the whole world and
[1:25:33] collapsed
[1:25:34] nature humanity and all nature under him
[1:25:38] all Eve did was believe a message that
[1:25:41] was 99% correct and one word not even a
[1:25:46] big word just three letters n o t he
[1:25:50] quoted to Eve what God Said but he added
[1:25:53] thou sh not surely die amen and that's
[1:25:58] all it took and brother Bram just simply
[1:26:00] said in his logic if one little
[1:26:03] three-letter word broke it how you going
[1:26:05] to restore it with anything less than
[1:26:07] the full
[1:26:09] perfect you've got to have thus sayith
[1:26:12] the Lord you can't have 33,000 different
[1:26:15] ideas trying to fix it and make a
[1:26:17] Rapture that's never going to work
[1:26:19] that's going to go into tribulation and
[1:26:21] the desperation in the tribulation is
[1:26:23] going to be so great that they're going
[1:26:25] to pull their resources and join
[1:26:27] together and come up under the mark of
[1:26:29] the beast they don't even realize the
[1:26:31] very system they're in is trapping
[1:26:34] them amen that's why brother brandham
[1:26:37] said the denominations will lead you to
[1:26:39] the mark of the beast yeah it's it's
[1:26:41] it's inescapable see so it'll lead you
[1:26:44] there unequivocally so so am so he says
[1:26:48] how you going to restore it back without
[1:26:50] returning and believing the pure word
[1:26:52] because the life is in the seed and
[1:26:54] every seed brings forth of its kind so
[1:26:56] when a prophet says she's predestinated
[1:27:01] not to fall and I'm going to give you
[1:27:03] one fold and I've got two or three more
[1:27:06] okay so don't when I give you this one
[1:27:08] don't just think I'm saying this is all
[1:27:10] of it okay so when a prophet says she's
[1:27:13] ordained not to fall that she's
[1:27:15] predestinated that she won't fall
[1:27:17] because she's
[1:27:18] predestinated it's in one sense in one
[1:27:21] fault of it it's the same thing as if I
[1:27:24] were to say uh that I will plant a wheat
[1:27:29] seed and it's ordained to not be corn
[1:27:35] right amen is that easy so so so now
[1:27:39] because of the every seed brings forth
[1:27:41] of its kind so predestination not to
[1:27:45] fall is a seed destined to grow into its
[1:27:50] intended
[1:27:51] crop easy yeah amen see so this is this
[1:27:56] is how and why that the opening of the
[1:28:00] seals birthed an infant bride it brought
[1:28:03] her on the seed be on the scene because
[1:28:05] it was a word and God spoken word is his
[1:28:08] seed and his seed brings life and it it
[1:28:11] birthed a bride see and and and and
[1:28:14] we're not even necessarily that's why
[1:28:16] brother Brenham made a a line of
[1:28:18] demarcation between what happened in the
[1:28:22] seals and he says not all those years of
[1:28:25] background because that's a prophet
[1:28:27] working in in the leoan in the time in
[1:28:30] the in the age of the church when before
[1:28:32] they kick Christ out and and he's got
[1:28:34] his prophet in there trying to pull you
[1:28:36] know trying to straighten it out as best
[1:28:38] as he can he he said I'm one born out of
[1:28:40] season in other words I I I'm kind of
[1:28:42] late to the party this thing was already
[1:28:44] underway when I rolled up and so I'm I
[1:28:46] see it'sot got a lot of problems I'm
[1:28:48] trying to fix it all and God gave him
[1:28:50] such signs and wonders that even those
[1:28:52] people who disagreed with his doct were
[1:28:54] kind kind of gave him pause like man
[1:28:56] that gift is amazing maybe we should
[1:28:58] hear what he's got to say and he would
[1:29:00] fill up auditoriums in the tens of
[1:29:02] thousands amen eventually they would
[1:29:05] reject Christ the seals would be open
[1:29:07] they'd crucify the word amen and on and
[1:29:10] on and on not no I don't want to go down
[1:29:11] that path either so I going to stay stay
[1:29:14] real real exact here so so we find then
[1:29:19] that it means that that the bride how
[1:29:22] did she come on the scene she has been
[1:29:25] birthed by the full word the original
[1:29:29] word has been restored to us and there
[1:29:32] is no discrepancy embedded in it amen so
[1:29:37] she's predestinated not to
[1:29:40] fall because the seed will bring forth
[1:29:43] of its
[1:29:44] kind oh you're getting it I can tell see
[1:29:47] so I mean I mean the exact opposite of
[1:29:50] this would be you know brother brandham
[1:29:53] teaching as I said Wednesday night that
[1:29:55] brother brandham shows us when he's
[1:29:57] teaching in the Book of Revelation that
[1:29:59] what made the false prophet
[1:30:02] false was that he taught a false
[1:30:05] teaching he taught false word and that
[1:30:08] made him a false prophet so we learned
[1:30:11] that you can be a real Prophet but you
[1:30:14] might not be a true Prophet right balam
[1:30:17] was a real Prophet but you understand so
[1:30:22] and and and so but he was he was a false
[1:30:24] real Prophet because he didn't teach uh
[1:30:28] the exact word of God he taught a
[1:30:30] hybridized version of of the of of
[1:30:33] Jehovah so so we find out then that that
[1:30:37] this is why brother Brandon would show
[1:30:40] us how how does the false Christ how
[1:30:44] does the Antichrist system of today
[1:30:48] convince
[1:30:50] billions billions of people to go along
[1:30:54] with him do you know that even the 10
[1:30:58] Kings who are like who and I and I again
[1:31:01] I'm not teaching on that either but 10
[1:31:04] dictators so so whether or not we say
[1:31:07] there it's you know this nation and that
[1:31:09] Nation whether it's a Muslim Nation
[1:31:10] whether it's a whatever Nation it is an
[1:31:12] orthodox Nation I don't you know whether
[1:31:14] it's a communist Nation I don't know
[1:31:15] it's just that even the 10 opposing
[1:31:18] kings in the end Time even they give
[1:31:20] their allegiance to him amen the whole
[1:31:23] world World whose name everyone whose
[1:31:25] name is not written in the Book of Life
[1:31:27] of the lamb slain before the foundation
[1:31:29] of the world will worship the Beast how
[1:31:32] does he get them to do it and brother
[1:31:34] brandham shows us he preaches them right
[1:31:37] into
[1:31:38] it now how grateful are you for a
[1:31:41] message of the
[1:31:42] hour he literally preaches billions and
[1:31:46] billions and billions right into the
[1:31:48] death trap
[1:31:51] see see so so the road to Zion or the
[1:31:56] road to predition all comes from either
[1:32:00] the seed of the word or a seed of
[1:32:03] discrepancy by Satan even if it only has
[1:32:07] one three-letter word error
[1:32:11] amen all right now so it it's it's it's
[1:32:15] the return of the full word now that's
[1:32:19] my first layer of why she's ordained not
[1:32:22] to fall you got it can move on she's
[1:32:25] predestinated she won't because she's
[1:32:26] got the right seed and the right seed
[1:32:28] will bring forth of its kind see so now
[1:32:31] let's go to another
[1:32:32] layer so we realize then that the return
[1:32:36] of the word and its power it's
[1:32:39] accompanying power you say how do you
[1:32:42] know it has accompaning power you you're
[1:32:44] standing on on the Earth spinning in the
[1:32:46] universe aren't you so God's word has a
[1:32:49] lot of power so we find that the return
[1:32:53] of the full word and its power that is
[1:32:57] the power of
[1:32:59] transformation to convert a sinner to a
[1:33:01] saint amen there's no power that can do
[1:33:05] that you're born as a sinner doesn't
[1:33:08] even matter if you have a gene of God
[1:33:10] you're still born in sin you still have
[1:33:12] to be born again amen and the only Power
[1:33:16] that has the enough Supernatural power
[1:33:19] to reverse your sin birth there has to
[1:33:21] be a s that you got that natural so
[1:33:24] there has to be a not natural power a
[1:33:26] supernatural power that can override
[1:33:29] that natural power and reverse the order
[1:33:32] and change your
[1:33:34] nature see and eventually it'll change
[1:33:39] your adoms that's right see amen right
[1:33:42] now it's changed that Third Realm I'm a
[1:33:45] Third Realm dweller say where is that in
[1:33:48] the I'm seated in Heavenly places in
[1:33:50] Christ Jesus there is a direct there a
[1:33:53] my soul and Christ are in
[1:33:56] superposition I I'm with him he's with
[1:33:58] me he's in heaven I'm on Earth but we're
[1:34:00] both in superposition and whatever he
[1:34:03] does I do you understand that's that's
[1:34:05] how that works that's what Einstein
[1:34:07] proved and and and and and and bores
[1:34:10] proved is that that when one is acting
[1:34:12] here it doesn't matter how far away it
[1:34:14] is when this one moves this one moves
[1:34:17] and it's not a reaction like bang bang
[1:34:20] it's bang bang bang bang yeah whatever
[1:34:24] one does the other one you understand
[1:34:27] and that and now you say oh we're not
[1:34:28] here for a science lesson I science only
[1:34:31] got their understanding from God that's
[1:34:34] right it's all science I I Jesus was the
[1:34:37] greatest scientist to ever walk the face
[1:34:39] of the Earth Solomon was right behind
[1:34:42] him
[1:34:43] see so so we understand then that that
[1:34:48] there's a gene of life now we want to
[1:34:50] first look at this one so this is from
[1:34:53] 19 62 the spoken word is Original
[1:34:56] Seed brother brandom says now Jesus in
[1:34:59] the word made manifest he and the word
[1:35:04] is one and the
[1:35:05] same and that's why it was so made
[1:35:09] manifest in him so perfectly that's why
[1:35:12] his life so manifested the word of God
[1:35:16] he always did that which pleased the
[1:35:17] father see because he and the father
[1:35:19] were one that's the reason that God
[1:35:21] manifested himself so perfectly in Jesus
[1:35:24] because he was the seed word The Germ
[1:35:26] word itself The Germ that's inside the
[1:35:29] seed that's the life in the seed you get
[1:35:33] it you get it see he was The Germ word
[1:35:36] of God the germ is the spirit The Germ
[1:35:39] is the water see now and so now he's
[1:35:42] going all right so now that's the the
[1:35:45] gene of life within us a seed Gene of
[1:35:48] life within us it's the it's a piece of
[1:35:51] God all right but now watch because now
[1:35:54] we're going to talk about the pure word
[1:35:55] the N discrepancy
[1:35:58] word and Jesus had to be broken open
[1:36:01] there in order for that seed to let
[1:36:04] forth its life to water other seed that
[1:36:08] was
[1:36:10] coming oh did you see it congregation
[1:36:14] says even he said other sheep I have not
[1:36:17] of this fold I have they're going to see
[1:36:19] that they're going to get the word and
[1:36:21] stay right with it and I'm sending for
[1:36:23] for the spirit to water it so now he's
[1:36:26] going to send forth the Holy Ghost to
[1:36:28] water the seed to bring it to life amen
[1:36:31] all right watch all right so so he says
[1:36:35] they're going to see that they're going
[1:36:36] to get that word and stay right with it
[1:36:38] I'm sending forth the spirit to water it
[1:36:40] and it'll produce just exactly it'll
[1:36:42] produce Miracles it'll produce the power
[1:36:44] of God it'll produce and it will not
[1:36:47] deny anything because it's a kindred
[1:36:50] seed with the
[1:36:51] seed Kindred seed with the seed so so
[1:36:56] the seed in here that I was born with
[1:36:58] agrees with the seed right here which
[1:37:00] agrees with the one who spoke it who had
[1:37:02] the Original Seed this is Brother Ram
[1:37:05] says this is the holy spirit made into
[1:37:07] word that's a direct statement this is
[1:37:10] the Holy Ghost made word and I believe
[1:37:13] it and I'm and that's why I receive life
[1:37:15] from it when I believe it it trans it's
[1:37:17] the power of
[1:37:18] transformation see it's
[1:37:22] beautiful so now he comes to
[1:37:27] 1965 and he's going to give some final
[1:37:30] thoughts to this
[1:37:31] idea God's power to
[1:37:34] transform he says on that seventh
[1:37:36] morning now we read last time in the
[1:37:39] Book of Genesis and we went through that
[1:37:41] creation and we came to the seventh day
[1:37:44] and God rested from all his work amen
[1:37:47] you remember that everything that he
[1:37:49] made that he had made and he said it's
[1:37:51] all very good right now brother Brandon
[1:37:55] picks up the narrative right there he
[1:37:57] says where that seventh morning when God
[1:38:00] looked upon it all and he said it's good
[1:38:03] I am pleased with it yeah I'm glad I did
[1:38:05] it and it's all now under control and I
[1:38:09] have put my trust in my son and in his
[1:38:12] wife and they will make them I'll make
[1:38:15] them head of of all of it that that they
[1:38:18] will watch over it and see that it's all
[1:38:22] right that every everything will bring
[1:38:24] forth of its kind now brother R says now
[1:38:27] he has the power to do that God then
[1:38:30] said well if it's all so good and it
[1:38:35] can't be anything else because it's my
[1:38:37] own desire it's the way I want it and I
[1:38:41] have spoke it that way and my words has
[1:38:44] brought it just exactly the way I wanted
[1:38:47] it and there it is it's all good so the
[1:38:49] Bible said God rested the seventh day
[1:38:53] from from all of his works so this is
[1:38:56] the very order friends that will take us
[1:38:59] back to the Millennium aren't we trying
[1:39:00] to get there see because what what are
[1:39:03] we trying to get back to that seventh
[1:39:05] day what broke it God's family disobeyed
[1:39:08] the word believed a seed of discrepancy
[1:39:10] and broke it but the second adom comes
[1:39:13] back to redeem
[1:39:14] it hallelujah amen see so we're coming
[1:39:18] back to that seventh day he carries on
[1:39:19] and everything under control to bring
[1:39:23] forth of its kind now remember to bring
[1:39:25] when he put the seed in the Earth the
[1:39:27] seed can only come forth with the power
[1:39:29] of life within it to transform it from a
[1:39:31] seed to a plant or whatever it was his
[1:39:35] transforming power now God put the seed
[1:39:38] in there with potentials that it would
[1:39:42] be what he said it would be as long as
[1:39:46] it stayed in its right category it would
[1:39:50] be just exactly what God said it would
[1:39:52] be amen so when you stay in a Rapture
[1:39:56] message you gain the Rapture amen see
[1:40:00] amen so so we find here all right so he
[1:40:05] says
[1:40:07] um it had to be that way all right
[1:40:10] anything that stays in his channel in
[1:40:13] his line of word it'll have to bring
[1:40:16] forth exactly like his word said it
[1:40:20] would do see th this is the advantage in
[1:40:23] in in do in our domestic lives I mean
[1:40:26] you know and and this is the advice I
[1:40:28] give you know when when parents are
[1:40:30] having trouble with their teenagers or
[1:40:32] when married couples are having trouble
[1:40:34] between each other stay in the order of
[1:40:37] God's word just keep following the order
[1:40:39] of God's word it will come forth just
[1:40:42] don't leave that order the the life
[1:40:45] that's in the word you're believing will
[1:40:46] force itself and it'll come forward see
[1:40:51] see so you don't take matters into your
[1:40:52] own hands all right so so he says it
[1:40:56] cannot move from there see it will bring
[1:40:58] forth exactly like his word said it
[1:41:00] would do it's Channel just exactly right
[1:41:03] so with everything in in the trust of
[1:41:05] his own son that it would be that way
[1:41:09] then God said it's all good so I'll just
[1:41:12] rest I love this now and each one of
[1:41:16] those seeds has power in itself to
[1:41:20] transform itself into the species that I
[1:41:23] desire it to be that's what it must be
[1:41:27] because I have given every seed
[1:41:29] transforming power now think about the
[1:41:32] gene of God that's in you I have given
[1:41:35] every seed transforming power it's
[1:41:38] inside it understand I've given every
[1:41:41] seed transforming power to make out of
[1:41:44] itself in its potentials now to make out
[1:41:47] of itself exactly what I want it to be
[1:41:54] Hallelujah so so when we realize then
[1:41:57] that a supernatural birth that comes by
[1:42:00] the work of the holy ghost in a
[1:42:04] supernatural baptism that's how the new
[1:42:07] that's how it comes that's how that
[1:42:08] dormant seed comes to life you always
[1:42:12] had it but you walked in the ways of the
[1:42:13] world you were by very nature the
[1:42:15] children of Wrath even as others but God
[1:42:17] rich in Mercy what loved us while we
[1:42:19] were Sinners chased us down revealed
[1:42:22] himself to us light struck the seed and
[1:42:24] life came
[1:42:25] forth thank you Lord so then you are a
[1:42:29] new creation in Christ and that places
[1:42:34] your life on a different
[1:42:38] path so you say so brother Jason so the
[1:42:41] Holy Ghost leads me to Zion
[1:42:44] no no that's not what the Holy Ghost is
[1:42:48] for you understand the Holy Ghost
[1:42:50] doesn't lead you to Zion the Holy Ghost
[1:42:53] leads and guides you to
[1:42:56] truth see it brings the dormant life in
[1:43:00] the seed Gene of God to manifested life
[1:43:04] that's what the Holy Ghost does and when
[1:43:07] that happens the presence of the Holy
[1:43:10] Ghost In Your Heart then it leads you
[1:43:13] here's what leads you it leads you to be
[1:43:16] a surrendered vessel like Jesus
[1:43:20] was that you you're surren you're
[1:43:23] surrender his like he surrendered his
[1:43:25] will continually to everything in the
[1:43:29] word of
[1:43:31] God hallelujah you understand the
[1:43:34] presence of that that's what the
[1:43:36] presence of the Holy Ghost In Your Heart
[1:43:38] does this is this is now this is exactly
[1:43:42] why now you understand why we don't just
[1:43:45] Chase emotionalism amen this is exactly
[1:43:48] why people can actually have a true
[1:43:51] experience with the Holy Ghost but still
[1:43:54] not be born
[1:43:56] again see how you going to make that fit
[1:43:59] see this is why the Holy Ghost can fall
[1:44:02] as a true anointing of God upon a false
[1:44:06] vessel and it will even prophesy and
[1:44:09] it'll even be accurate prophecy it'll
[1:44:11] operate signs and wonders and deceive
[1:44:14] the people and be
[1:44:16] false you understand so because the rain
[1:44:19] falls on the just and the unjust the
[1:44:21] weeds Rejoice right along inside the
[1:44:23] wheat plant when they're in the field
[1:44:25] together they are both in the field
[1:44:27] growing together this is now this
[1:44:30] explains why brother Brandon would say
[1:44:31] in leadership his last preached last
[1:44:34] text sermon in cavina he says the choice
[1:44:37] of your conduct you can't mix it now
[1:44:40] you're either for God or against God and
[1:44:44] the outward Expressions shows exactly
[1:44:47] what's on the inside see the cucker bur
[1:44:50] many of you think I got the baptism of
[1:44:52] the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that
[1:44:54] don't mean one thing that you're going
[1:44:56] to heaven amen no sir you can have the
[1:45:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in
[1:45:02] your life and still be lost and go to
[1:45:04] hell the Bible said so that's exactly
[1:45:06] right so so then and then he goes from
[1:45:09] there to breaking down see you're a
[1:45:10] Triune being you're Body Spirit and soul
[1:45:14] so you can have an experience of the
[1:45:15] Holy Spirit on your flesh and you can
[1:45:17] run and shout and sing and dance and run
[1:45:19] all over the place you can you can have
[1:45:21] it anoint your spirit and believe every
[1:45:23] promise and miracles can take place and
[1:45:25] people can even get healed under your
[1:45:26] ministry you can actually cast out
[1:45:29] Devils Judas did that Judas cast out
[1:45:32] Devils they were they had to obey even
[1:45:35] judas's scariot see but that he wasn't
[1:45:39] born again and and so the the disciples
[1:45:41] the true ones were casting out Devils
[1:45:43] even before they were born again so the
[1:45:46] Holy Ghost you what is the Holy Ghost
[1:45:48] then brother Jason the Holy Ghost is the
[1:45:50] evidence that God has accepted my
[1:45:53] repentance as being full and being
[1:45:56] genuine and I haven't repented partially
[1:45:59] I haven't kind of repented and I'm sorry
[1:46:02] for what I did but I'd still kind of
[1:46:04] like to keep this box over here Lord how
[1:46:06] about I take out my favorite things put
[1:46:07] them in here you leave those alone I'll
[1:46:09] give you everything else you're never
[1:46:11] going to get a new birth doing that
[1:46:13] you've got because the Holy Ghost leads
[1:46:15] you and guides you to all truth and the
[1:46:18] truth comes upon your life and it lights
[1:46:20] up a seed and that seed is like chist
[1:46:23] and then it takes over the body and you
[1:46:25] begin to surrender your will every day
[1:46:27] and that seed is going home and that's
[1:46:30] what takes you in a
[1:46:33] Rapture that's what brings the sleeping
[1:46:36] Saints forward and that's what changes
[1:46:38] your elements because you have an inside
[1:46:40] perfect
[1:46:42] faith that believes every word of God
[1:46:45] see and it's all the work hear me it's
[1:46:49] all the work of the Holy Ghost amen see
[1:46:53] it's all the work of the Holy Ghost so
[1:46:55] even when I say so the Holy Ghost takes
[1:46:57] me to Zion I only say no because it's
[1:47:01] not just like he comes in gives you a
[1:47:03] baptism and then takes you to heaven he
[1:47:05] comes in lights up a seed the seed takes
[1:47:08] over you enter the greatest battle ever
[1:47:10] fought you start living like Jesus and
[1:47:12] you're growing that life to the top of
[1:47:14] the pyramid and that's what brings a
[1:47:16] body change so so we come back to it
[1:47:19] again it takes the word the full word
[1:47:22] the whole word and nothing but the word
[1:47:24] and you got to have a perfect faith in a
[1:47:26] perfect God to keep a perfect promise
[1:47:29] and that's where we're headed to friend
[1:47:31] that's why she's predestinated not to
[1:47:34] fall that's why she's ordained to not
[1:47:39] fall see he says in Christ is the
[1:47:42] mystery I got to close in n in eight and
[1:47:44] a half minutes you
[1:47:48] good
[1:47:50] predestinated Christ is a Myst God
[1:47:52] revealed
[1:47:53] predestinated there's the mystery before
[1:47:56] Christ or anything else was ever on
[1:47:58] Earth you see his great mystery that he
[1:48:01] chose the bride knowing Eve would fall
[1:48:03] from disbelieving the word knowing that
[1:48:06] she would fall but he would choose a
[1:48:08] bride that would not fall that would
[1:48:11] hold to that word regardless of what the
[1:48:14] rest of the world had to say about it
[1:48:16] they would hold to that word they are
[1:48:20] predestinated to stand there adoption of
[1:48:23] children by Jesus Christ predestinated
[1:48:26] the church to that great glorious stand
[1:48:29] so not only will she not fall and not
[1:48:32] only will she not stand she will not
[1:48:35] fall and stand
[1:48:37] gloriously I'm not just looking to stand
[1:48:40] I want to stand
[1:48:42] Victorious I want to be part of his
[1:48:44] glory I want my life to be like Christ
[1:48:47] to reflect the pattern that Jesus laid
[1:48:50] down for us that's why we're marching to
[1:48:53] Zion beautiful Zion Oh friends this is
[1:48:56] why the word has come to us in this hour
[1:48:59] this is why you should take it with all
[1:49:01] your heart and don't take part of it
[1:49:03] don't leave your life tangled up into
[1:49:04] the world get free of that kind of stuff
[1:49:07] let the Holy Ghost bring you
[1:49:10] up bring you up and out of this world
[1:49:13] like an eagle soar you into the heavens
[1:49:16] how many want that friends is that the
[1:49:18] desire of your heart oh stand with me
[1:49:21] all over the building I dare not go
[1:49:22] further we'll be here a while longer but
[1:49:25] that's the plan of God in the word this
[1:49:29] is why we say it's so important let me
[1:49:32] finish out this quote these musicians
[1:49:34] are coming still got
[1:49:37] you he says
[1:49:39] watch Redeemed by Christ the second Adam
[1:49:44] now Don't Drift on me keep keep
[1:49:46] focused the second Adam you believe he
[1:49:49] was you believe Christ was the second
[1:49:50] Adam yes going back home to Eden with
[1:49:54] his Fallen wife redeemed back home again
[1:49:58] that's Christ in the church today taking
[1:50:02] his wife back see the three-fold mystery
[1:50:05] now God manifested in Christ C in the
[1:50:09] Old Testament Christ manifested in the
[1:50:12] church through the 2,000 years of
[1:50:13] churches and all together to bring back
[1:50:16] the original Adam and Eve again man and
[1:50:19] woman which are one made out of the same
[1:50:21] blood and same spirit and everything
[1:50:23] else that this is why he could say the
[1:50:27] church is the blood of Christ by the
[1:50:30] spirit amen
[1:50:32] because the life is in the blood that's
[1:50:37] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:50:40] baptizes us into his body that
[1:50:43] recognizes only his body his flesh his
[1:50:47] word see predestinated the church to
[1:50:52] that great glorious stand
[1:50:56] amen see he says denominations won't
[1:51:01] never touch that
[1:51:03] amen because it's a revelation see so so
[1:51:08] the first reason that she's
[1:51:10] predestinated not to fall listen let me
[1:51:13] just say it like this the the first
[1:51:17] reason that i' I've spent all my sermon
[1:51:19] time today and I wanted to get to the
[1:51:22] second one but we'd be here while I'll
[1:51:24] get to it we'll have a part
[1:51:26] 15 but the first reason that she is
[1:51:29] predestinated not to fall is the exact
[1:51:33] same reasons denominations can't touch
[1:51:37] it do you understand let me say it again
[1:51:40] the very F the reason she's
[1:51:42] predestinated the very first part of the
[1:51:44] reason she's predestinated to not all
[1:51:47] that's the exact same reason
[1:51:48] denominations can't touch it because
[1:51:50] it's a revelation of the word why is she
[1:51:53] predestinated to not fall she's received
[1:51:55] a revelation of the word and the word
[1:51:58] has no discrepancies and the seed will
[1:52:01] bring forth of its kind as long as it's
[1:52:04] believed see amen so why why will not
[1:52:08] denominations then make it because they
[1:52:11] are they good people of course many of
[1:52:13] them very good people but they don't
[1:52:16] have the pure seed word they operate on
[1:52:20] partial truth brother I'm called it a
[1:52:21] Mongol
[1:52:23] he called it an ad mixture of Truth and
[1:52:26] false and those seeds of discrepancy you
[1:52:28] remember Jesus said the Kingdom of
[1:52:31] Heaven is like a woman like a church who
[1:52:33] took leav and put it in three measures
[1:52:35] of meal leev represents sin and she put
[1:52:38] that in the in the bread to feed the
[1:52:40] people so instead of getting the bread
[1:52:42] of life they got the bread of the church
[1:52:44] amen and just like that plunges them
[1:52:48] into a tribulation this takes you in the
[1:52:50] rapture
[1:52:53] oh my they don't have the pure seed word
[1:52:56] they operate on seed discrep and Seed
[1:52:58] listen friends it bars them it listen
[1:53:02] how I'm going say this it bars them from
[1:53:06] receiving the new birth just as
[1:53:09] receiving the life in the blood and
[1:53:12] having the token on display of the word
[1:53:15] in your
[1:53:16] life bars you from the tribulation amen
[1:53:21] the very seed of discrepancy they feed
[1:53:23] on bars them from the New Birth the same
[1:53:27] way that the Pure Living Word in you
[1:53:29] bars you from the
[1:53:31] tribulation Hallelujah no wonder she's
[1:53:35] ordained to stand there how many want to
[1:53:38] stand there today say I want my life to
[1:53:40] be represented that as the word of God
[1:53:43] in this
[1:53:44] hour oh my because you passed from Death
[1:53:47] To Life by the word by the baptism of
[1:53:50] the Holy Spirit who brought that Jes of
[1:53:52] God to life and that life has one place
[1:53:54] it's going back home Hallelujah and
[1:53:58] since it's inside me it takes me with it
[1:54:00] Hallelujah and I'm going to get a change
[1:54:03] of these mortal
[1:54:04] flesh Oh my he that's you've passed from
[1:54:08] Death to life you can never come into
[1:54:12] the Judgment never come into the
[1:54:16] condemnation as Jesus said amen praise

[1:56:41] audience not only this visible audience
[1:56:43] but out across the airwaves who've never
[1:56:47] heard the gospel presented quite like
[1:56:50] that I pray it'll be an opening
[1:56:53] experience for them I have sowed seed
[1:56:57] now they came they sat in a building
[1:57:00] they tuned in online they didn't realize
[1:57:03] that a secret thing unseen by their own
[1:57:06] mortal eye the seed of God angels were
[1:57:09] carrying the seed of the word to be swn
[1:57:12] into their heart I pray today that it
[1:57:16] won't be like the one by the wayside and
[1:57:19] they'll just leave here and then the
[1:57:21] fouls of the air just take take from
[1:57:23] them even what they heard I pray it
[1:57:25] won't be on Stony ground I pray that
[1:57:27] they'll want to move to good ground and
[1:57:29] say Lord I want to move into good
[1:57:31] fertile ground I want my life to be
[1:57:34] something more than it's been and they
[1:57:35] they won't say oh I love it I think I'll
[1:57:37] believe it but then stay connected to
[1:57:39] the world n Lord may it not be so may
[1:57:42] there be everyone Lord under the sound
[1:57:45] of my voice today here present across
[1:57:47] the airwaves by an archive at a later
[1:57:49] time may they come to know you as Paul
[1:57:54] said that I may know him like Paul knew
[1:57:57] him the way Jesus knew the father that I
[1:58:02] may know him and the power of His
[1:58:07] Resurrection May It Be So today Lord God
[1:58:10] that as they go from this building Lord
[1:58:13] they'll go we're humans we have life
[1:58:15] we'll be around tomorrow if you don't if
[1:58:18] if our life isn't determined to be ended
[1:58:21] we we'll carry on in tomorrow and the
[1:58:23] next day and the next day the next day
[1:58:25] that's not a that's not in question
[1:58:26] we'll carry on until we're until we
[1:58:28] don't we'll be here until we're not but
[1:58:31] while I'm
[1:58:32] here what am I doing with my life while
[1:58:35] I'm here Lord I want it to count for
[1:58:38] something oh Lamb of God let this word
[1:58:42] today burn down in our heart deep into
[1:58:44] our soul let it cause a reaction Lord an
[1:58:48] action a reaction to the action May It
[1:58:51] Be so oh God I pray for every hearer of
[1:58:55] the word of God today I pray you'll do
[1:58:57] that that that Thing You Do Lord that
[1:59:00] only you can do by your power by your
[1:59:03] Wonder working power oh you fell on
[1:59:07] thousands at a time and they they gave
[1:59:09] their heart to the Lord they they broke
[1:59:12] bread with the with the disciples and
[1:59:14] they continually they continued
[1:59:16] steadfast in the word and the preaching
[1:59:18] of the Apostles may it be so today that
[1:59:21] that kind of a holy ghost experience
[1:59:23] will be for us all whether we shout or
[1:59:26] run or weep or cry whether we stand
[1:59:28] still or Roll On The Ground Lord I want
[1:59:31] the Holy Spirit to lead and guide me to
[1:59:34] all truth I want to have that
[1:59:36] Supernatural experience of the Holy
[1:59:38] Ghost down in my soul so that it can
