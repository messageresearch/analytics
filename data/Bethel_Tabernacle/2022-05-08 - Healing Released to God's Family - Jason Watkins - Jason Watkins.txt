out if brother kenny knew the title of my sermon today i'm taking a title today healing released to the family of god wow let's pray father what a confirmation to know that you're here this morning lord to know that no human frailty can keep you at bay when you are determined to do something lord nothing can stop you we lift hands and praise you for that today lord we thank you from the depths of our heart move on the scene now lord take your word father and break it to the people let it be a deliverance now and an instruction to us father we commit ourselves into your hands in jesus name amen god bless your friends i'm going to invite you to the gospel of saint luke we're going to start in chapter 14. i want to make some announcements while you're finding your place there in luke chapter 14. i want to say i heard brother kenny already but wanted to wish all of our mothers a happy mother's day near and far amen we've got a number of moms out today caring for sick children and and the enemy just trying to show up but he ain't nobody he still ain't nobody he want nobody last week he ain't gonna meet nobody next week we do not live by the mercies of lucifer you just keep that in your mind and you put him in his place now listen you say that's presumptuous it's not brother branham said faith tells the devil to shut up i'm sorry little guys if mom says that's you shouldn't say that but but but he said no actually brother branham says you know you know doubt tries to say something says faith says shut your mouth amen so i just think we should tell the devil today shut your mouth you have no authority over us we are liberated we are the family of god we are free we are above it hallelujah he has no jurisdiction over us the bible says with his own he does with him whatever he wants to do but you have been liberated from the power of death amen he has no jurisdiction over you and i this morning brother david good to see you amen here with us this morning amen we've got a number of families just under the attack of the enemy but our god is greater amen and we're going to hold them up in prayer today i want to make an announcement remind the senior youth about our senior youth banquet it's a casual banquet that i want to do with them uh by myself parents are excluded sorry you know you're not welcome uh brother kenny and sister anita will be there helping me we're doing it at the urban brew at 7 00 pm sunday i'm sorry 7 pm tuesday tuesday forget i just said sunday tuesday amen at 7 00 pm at the urban brew if you have not given brother kenny your uh menu item then you will go hungry and we will eat in front of you and and say shut us you should have turned it in amen you've had who is it oh yeah caitlyn is cooking for us well sister caitlin thank you kindly amen i sure appreciate all the help amen and so we've been announcing it for weeks bombing the youth chat that only half the youth check and the parents of youth chat that only a third of them check and so this is a public there's a public service announcement today please follow the make sure that you get the notifications when important announcements go out from church especially if they come from me amen don't make me get on you praise the lord our youth weekend our youth weekend of services begins next weekend friday night saturday night and sunday morning and there's a saturday daytime activities day at the carson state park where we had it last year i'm sure that's where it's at same same same place amen so we're looking forward to that consequently because we have the tuesday banquet services start on friday and a big weekend and there's a lot of people you have to understand there's a lot of people behind the scenes working to make everything i just named go so we're going to post we're going to cancel our wednesday service on may the 11th and we will convene here again on friday night now again i want to make this clear that everybody is is invited to the youth weekend as far as sanctuary seating it's youth and the parents of youth first and we will have an overflow in the fellowship hall so i don't want you to think that you can't come to church on this next week and you can it's just there will probably not be any seating available inside the sanctuary because we we we nearly capped out our 150 young people coming in from many states and then there's the parents uh of our youth and parents that'll show up with their youth and so we'll probably have the sanctuary packed out hey jd it is course in tate park right okay yeah on saturday now you need to get to praying because the weather is forecasting rain for saturday but when i start when i when we i mentioned that at the minister's meeting and it was 90 and today it was only 70 so prayer is working keep it going keep it going uh in buford we don't we don't worry about anything unless it goes above 60 anyhow 60 in buford means nothing and we all know that brother brad says he's having to get used to that and i said get used to it because 60 rain around here means almost no chance of rain uh so right now it's at 70 but i'd like to see a a wonderful beautiful weekend how many knows god has done that for us time and time and time and time and time again so let's believe him amen that he'll do it again i've got a prayer request a couple of them here i want to pray so brother jason put this in our little sister mina at home 102 fever that's of this morning and so um avery's on the mend praise the lord addie just started coughing amy and i feeling just fine however sister amy's at home caring for her her children uh brother bruce paris writes good morning brother jason would you please have prayer for sister rachel sweeney's husband bill we all most of us remember brother bill he has a severe and i don't know what it is but it's a severe skin condition god bless you that's from brother bruce so we're going to read our text and then we'll have prayer over these prayer requests i think that's all the announcements that i have verse number 1 luke chapter um what's chapter 14 thank you luke chapter 14 verse that's what it is verse 16. we're starting at verse 16. jesus speaking then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bade many and sent his servant at suppertime to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent begin to make excuse the first said unto him i have bought a piece of ground and i must needs go and see it i pray thee have me excused so here's somebody letting business get in the way of their service to god and coming to the feast amen and another said i've bought five yoke of oxen same thing and i go to prove them i pray thee have me excused and another said i've married a wife and therefore i cannot come so that servant came and showed his lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind and the servants said lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for i say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper let's pray father we thank you for the reading of your word and for the sure anointing that we feel upon it we pray for these sick people lord we're asking prayer for brother jason's household i understand lord brother travis and sister deborah have sickness there lord brother bruce is asking prayer for his his son-in-law bill sweeney who we know well we ask mercy on these situations in these cases and lord wherever else that your family might be suffering sickness father we just rebuke it and the name of the lord jesus christ right now lord we take authority over that devil and we say you must go away into dry places for we deliver god's people to health in the name of jesus christ we pray and believe it in jesus name amen god bless you you can be seated some services ago i read this first quote that i want to read you again this morning from the message identification we showed it on the overhead last time we won't bother doing that this time just to save some time brother branham says in in the message identification in january 1963 he says we are invited we are invited by god not wonderful i mean what an opening line we're invited by god how many want to hear the invitation if you if you received a a note in your you know some kind of delivery came to your door and it said note from god man you would you'd be ready to open that we're invited by god thank you brother to take him as an example and let our and let let our let our let let let our character be molded it's an invitation it's not a it's not an uh uh some kind of edict that god is saying hey guess what i'm gonna come and crack you over the head with my character and i'm going to jam it down into you see we would all be crying foul if he tried to do that but he's saying a prophet is saying you are invited to take him as an example and let our character be molded like his what a thing my then watch now then now this this next statement assumes you're willing to do that so before i read the next statement how many are willing to let him mold his character into our life ten percent how many are willing you've been invited by god to let to take him as an example and let him mold his character into your life then when we let his character be in us then we have become sons by having the mind of christ mind the mind which is his character see let this mind be in you let his character be in you all right so which is his character your mind makes your character let the mind paul said of christ this mind that was in christ be in you let that mind of christ prophet repeats it be in you it molds here's the advantage here's the payoff it molds the character of a son of god sons and daughters let me add to that sons and daughters of god say what's the real advantage of that will i become the wealthiest person in the world absolutely absolutely in the wealth that counts other wealth by comparison is worth nothing and the antichrist is going to get it anyway and it's going to go in into ash and cinder come on friends it wouldn't matter what you acquire and accomplish and how many plaques are on your wall and whatever station you're right arise to doesn't matter that you get the world's plaudits it's all going to ash and cinder and but there is another realm of eternity where everything that you allow that realm to come into you survives and so i say if that's eternal life then give it to me see it molds the character of a son of god so brother branham says further in the restoration of the bride tree a very important message now he says all right he says he's coming now to preach this this message and i want you to catch this title is super important the restoration of the bride tree now that's you amen it's the restoration of the tree of life and it's it's always the tree in the garden of eden the tree of life was a person the tree of knowledge was a person amen so when the tree of life uh became a person in christ jesus uh he he talks about being that tree that bread that will that water of life he was the light and the light the light was the life and the life is the light amen and so when we when we see a restoration of the bright tree then we're seeing the restoration of jesus in human flesh now not the galilean not the one who walked the shores of galilee who went about doing good do you realize friends that the world will not see that jesus again until the end of the tribulation the only form of jesus that they will see is in his body that's you that's his bride tree get it it's the bride tree all right so it's it's coming it came up through stages of restoration in the days of lutheran wesley and into the into the azusa revival and then it come into the mighty god unveiled under the opening of the seals and and all of that was to do what so that a bride could eat her way to a body change she could feed on the engrafted word of god receive the token life which is the jubilee which is eternal life and you say you know how does this work well let me just give you the end game it changes your body at the molecular level someday friends not in this isn't disney this isn't pixar this isn't a story this isn't dickens this is for real in real time the dead in christ are going to rise from the graves and we which are alive in these corp in these failing bodies are going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye into new bodies and it'll still be you and it'll still be me only it'll be the real me and the real you hallelujah and that that's a a preview of coming attractions and it's coming soon to a household near you in my kitchen in my living room hallelujah this drama is going to be played out brother branham said one of these days you're going to be standing in your kitchen and you'll feel a little funny feeling go over you and you'll turn around and there'll be the the parent who crossed over a sibling who crossed over a friend and they'll be standing there young prophet said you might feel a little twinge of pain and when that happens he said it'll be the last pain you ever feel hallelujah i want to make it real to you today friends so brother branham now is approaching the restoration of the bride tree message this is his sermon so i i laid all of that in there so you catch the significance of what he's about to say in this quote i'm going to read to you so bear in mind this is the now this is 1962. april and brother branham had a troubling experience where he heard a blast and thought it'd be the end of his life and it bothered him he didn't know what it meant it was the approaching seals it was coming but brother branham thought it must be the end of his life until he he he's later given to understand that it's your ministry it's not the end of your life it's your ministry and and what was happening was is there the restoration of the bride tree was was approaching its final move in the drama its final move in the opera its final move in the symphony the symphony was playing its last piece of music amen and so he says in this approaching time he says this will be my last message to the church for this part of the church for some time he's getting ready to go into the field and he says and we're expecting a healing service this morning now catch it when he's preaching the sermon the restoration of the bride tree he says we're expecting a healing service this morning and i want now watch watch him connect it and i want this message if god will bless it to sink deep into our hearts so we'll get the meaning of what it means the restoration of the bride tree is the endgame for god's family that she comes to the point and i say well then then then why haven't we why is it 60 years ago when he preached this and the seals are open because remember that when jesus came to the earth he was an infant he wasn't ready to go to calvary as an infant he wasn't ready to go at 12. he wasn't ready to go at 30 when he came into the water then he had to go into the wilderness then he had to walk three three and a half years see and so and so what did brother branham say he said at the approach of christ in his first coming i'm getting ahead of myself but i can't turn back he says that three stars lined up and those magi followed those stars coming from the east for years for a couple of years and and what did those stars portend to the magi it it was an announcement of the approach of messiah and so they began they were they were hebrew scholars who were studying in the far east and when they saw that sign in the heavens they correlated it to prophecy and they realized my we're living in the day when time is going to meet prophecy and that messiah is coming to the earth and they they literally left their studies and left everything behind him at that point nothing nothing nothing mattered to them except their journey to messiah to find him and they came into jerusalem after two years of travel where is he where's who the king what king our king oh my and the bible says it caused a big stir everywhere even the even herod you know wants to question what is this about a king my goodness did you not read prophecy your majesty do you not realize that we have seen his star in the east this was this was actually believe it or not it shows you anointed ones at the end time they were following a prophecy from balaam when balak tried to get him to curse the jews remember that and he said i can't say anything but what god puts in my mouth and when he they offered him more money and more prestige and he tried to curse him and when he opened his mouth to curse him to collect the big bounty out comes out of his mouth oh there will be a star rising jacob hallelujah and that's exactly what happened a star they were literally following that star why because god could use even an animal or even a false prophet to declare his word you understand but i'm going to tell you something when the word comes to materialization there's nothing false about it in fact is it is uniquely the only truth when christ came he was the only truth all other truth had to be abandoned all other perceived knowledge sixteen hundred years worth to those hebrew scholars sixteen hundred years and they'd gotten it from moses no less and it was all coming to an end and so brother branham is saying we're expecting a healing service because now watch three stars lined up at his approach the first time as the seals began to come in at the latter part of 1962 there was another sign in the heavens five stars lined up and brother branham says what is it what is it what is five stars lining up what does it mean it's it's it's a sign in the heavens it's an infant bride like an infant jesus it's now an infant bride and those five stars are announcing her approach see the seals hadn't come yet she wasn't quite on the scene and then when she comes on the scene she's an infant he's not coming back to marry an infant he's coming back to marry a mature bride amen so so we've been this many decades now doing what getting the fruit back in the top of the tree it had to restore the whole bride tree because when it went down it went down from the early age when the fruits of the spirit were all shining in the presence of the son and the power of god was chronicling a book of acts and writing a faith chapter and the apostles were doing great and mighty deeds in the name of said in the name of thy holy child jesus it was literally rocking the enemy's kingdom and and satan went you know he goes to sleep one night and he's got one jesus to deal with he wakes up the next morning and here's the announcement now you got uh you got 120 i mean that's a pretty big percentage to jump from one to 120. okay boys it's not the end of the world let's get our rigging let's get our plan let's go check this out he couldn't even arrive on the scene until now there's three thousand and it just went on from there and god kept adding to the church daily hallelujah he's still adding he's still calling jesus heals jesus saves jesus still fills with the holy ghost i'm a recipient of it how many are recipients of that today we know him in the power of his resurrection my goal is to know him more i do know him in the power of his resurrection my daily goal is to know him more i have a never ending never sleeping never resting never ceasing hunger for more and more and more say when when how much how much do you need can i use a rockefeller statement a little more than i got how much is enough a little more than i got i'm not body changed yet so i'm on a quest hallelujah and i don't plan to turn around i don't even plan to slow down come on friends amen praise the lord so during this this momentous time he's expecting there to be healing will accompany this arrival this stars announcing an approach the word's about to become flesh and the prophet is showing us now with the understanding once he said i want to go slow and let it sink deep so that when you get the real concept of the bride tree and that it's you trust me there's healing for mind body and soul and you're going to need it so the same way that god sent signs in the heavens as his as his appearing neared 2 000 years ago he once again did the same thing for the opening of the seven seals with lining up five stars as it began to approach it was an infant bride now in both cases and this is an important point in both cases 2 000 years ago and in and in the day in which the hour which we live at the opening of the word in both cases these signs in the heavens heralded the approach of the word coming into flesh don't lose sight of that in other words it wasn't just merely doctrine it's not about he was just going to bring more teaching you understand but there would come a dynamic see not not not just the mechanics of the teaching but there would be a teaching rain in a former rain but the latter rain would be a dynamic of the holy ghost to take that word that you fed on and put dynamic power to it and start altering your lifestyle your mind giving you power if you get sick in your body giving you power if you get bound up by a devil giving you power if you've got trouble in your home giving you power to claim young people to claim children to heal a marriage there's dynamic power in the word and so we're not here to live as paupers underprivileged i'm here to tell you something today friends with the restoration of the bride tree comes every healing you could possibly need your healing is here before you even might need it next week it's already here [Music] you wake up tomorrow feeling a little ill just know that say well my healing was here since yesterday i'm just going to go ahead and have a little bit of it amen so so in both cases they heralded the approach of the word coming into flesh and it brought healing in and and and as israel now watch this because i'm going to correlate some history to you so as israel as a nation needed healing over their minds toward the word you bear and and say what does that even mean okay okay here's something familiar you remember how brother brown talks about how that and this bears out in lexical aids galore brother branham pointed it out as all scholars do that at that time israel was looking for a general they wanted some warrior something on the order of alexander you know they had they had seen these great champions rise up and they wanted somebody on the order you know they had had a maccabean revolt and they wanted somebody they remembered joshua see they remembered david mighty warriors in battle right and and that's what they thought they needed they thought they needed a new champion they thought they needed a new general and brother branham said god humiliated them by sending him a baby lord we need a we need a warrior okay we need a we need a champion somebody who can drive all these romans out of here okay uh where is he lord come on there's a manger over here what i remember some friends of mine told me one time that uh they is way back in the day uh and they had a an only they had a son he was the only only uh boy and he had two sisters and he wanted a brother and he's only about five years old and he wanted a brother he'd get out in rough house and play in the dirt with and girls were frilly and prissy and they didn't want to do that and um so they found out that his his his aunt was gonna she was pregnant and she found out it's a boy and so they they tell him say wes she you're gonna have a little playmate he'll be your cousin wesley was so excited he was just like on cloud night he couldn't wait he had to wait nine months and finally the big day came and they brought him to the house and they walked him up to the crib they said wes check it out and he said he stood there and he said it's a baby it's a baby he thought he was going to get a little buddy immediately his age see and so so so we find out that israel needed their minds healed so you know what god did he sent him he lied to the prophet and you know what the message of john the baptist was repent now that's important repent see and it's not it's not about it's not and i'm going to show you in the book of acts here in a minute the exact same principle when paul is migrating the gospel to the jews and he's he's he's taking that along and it and and peter also on the day of pentecost when he says repent now remember when peter let me just give you this one peter when he says to those men they said what must we do and he says you must repent now they weren't drunkards and whoremongers and gamblers and extortioners the bible says these were devout jews so he's not saying a bunch of adulterers you need to clean up your life what he's saying is you have a your mind needs healed you looked at the promise and god fulfilled it in his son and you murdered him so you had a wrong concept of your your leadership told you it can't be him and and your minds were corrupted you by determinant paul peter said by determinant counsel your counselors told you this and you went through with it and and they're just destroyed over that my goodness we killed our king he says now don't worry because it wasn't possible that the grave could hold him because david had said he'll not suffer his holy one to see corruption and and the great he'll not suffer uh his soul to stay in hell and neither suffer his holy one to seek corruption and that same jesus whom you crucified has risen from the dead and god hath made him both lord and christ and right there 3 000 were added to the church what happened they repented in their minds they had their minds healed they had 1600 years of wrong thinking corrected see and that has to be brother brown talks about in greatest battle ever fall it's got to start in the mind see and then it's got to drop 18 inches under the inspiration of the holy spirit it's got to drop into the heart and then that's the new birth see he's what brother brahm is saying is right off the tape he says see if he can ever get that mind to agree with his word then that old nature perishes that old nature dies you see and then paul could say i i live i i'm dead but i live the old me died i'm a brand new creation amen so so the first thing they had to to have happen is they had to have their minds healed and so john the baptist elijah the prophet at the time when the when the the tree of life christ was now living in flesh and was a sacrifice for their sins and in a propitiation and an atonement and he lived the perceptive side and he was a worthy sacrifice and he ascended on high gave gifts unto men came back and lived inside of his church and this is what the gospel came to do this is this was the purpose of the gospel to bring the eternal god down into human creation and put him in the hearts and minds of people so so we find then that he's calling on them to repent of their thinking toward the promise of redemption that that was in the scripture israel had been promised a redeemer see just like today now let's fast forward to to the end game the whole world of christianity has been promised a savior to come and take us all to heaven amen i just was quoting you from first thessalonians 4 we which your life remains shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye all christendom waits for that hour see so the prophecy is is the same for us now but at the restoration of the bride tree there had to first come again a prophet with a message of healing that could not just heal their bodies but heal their mind and correct their error on how god was going to do this because he was definitely not going to do it like they think he didn't do it in the days when jesus was there and on the day of pentecost peter is telling them you have to repent of that thinking see so he does the same thing so when it was time then for paul find brother jason let's go to acts 17 and we'll catch 24-31 when it was time for paul to shepherd the gospel to the gentile world he would echo this exact same principle not in any way different read with me we're going to go verses 24 to 31 god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands and he's talking a bunch of gentiles who who are just heathens all right he and he's trying to get him he's trying to get him to understand remember he went to mars hill and he he gets up there and they want to hear something from him because they just love to hear new juicy things they weren't interested in changing you know anything but they loved super preachers you know they would get enamored with great oratory and great speakers didn't affect their lives on fact is if he suggested they should change their lives they wanted to kill him so so paul says i noticed among all of your many shrines to all of your many gods he says i noticed that i came across a place that said to the unknown god and paul got his text just like brother branham got his text from a package of cigarettes crumbled up in the woods a thinking man's filter and here paul gets a a text from a heathen shrine to a false deity and he says to the unknown god okay what do you have to say to us sir i want to talk to you about that unknown god i want to actually identify him to you today are you ready for that oh yes we want to hear it and paul begins god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worshipped with men's hands as though he needed anything seeing he giveth life to all and breath and all things see and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation that they should seek the lord if happily they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poet uh have said for we are also his offspring for as much then paul is now going to conclude he's going to sum up for as much then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and man's device and the times of this ignorance god winked at see because it was ignorance but now see here he's trying to convince his own nation his own nation to say listen you had 1600 years of tradition i'm trying to get you to understand that you did that under ignorance god used it moses gave it to you it worked the traditions of the fathers was fine until it finished its course and god wasn't going to use it anymore that's where we've arrived at today god has worked down through the church ages and he's work he's moved through great and mighty men and even they raised up organizations and even god found his children within there and saved them out of there no problem but now watch what paul is saying and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now if i say now commandeth not asking he commandeth all men jew and gentile all men everywhere to repent now in everything he named he didn't name one thing about adultery fornication liars covetous cruise breakers murderers he's talking about the worship and the approach to god and he's saying i have an announcement to the world i'm i'm i'm shepherding the gospel from the jews my countrymen who have rejected it and i'm shepherding at this now over and you might see me going to the gentiles this is why you should come along israel come along my countrymen because god's not staying back under that law anymore sixteen hundred years of tradition is now of no value its value is that it's it's served imagery that i can build new testament teaching off of but we're not worshiping there in fact is if if you go from here today and teach anyone they need to be circumcised then you have bypassed christ you've made calvary of no effect to the people see so this was radical this was this was this there was no way that the masses were going to accept this there would be a few elected that would there would always be an elect lady in the earth there would always be god has always had a representation in the earth and for 2 000 years and i'm here to tell you you're it today you're it today and our message is the same as john our message is the same as peter our message is the same as paul it's time for the restoration of the bride tree what's going to happen she's going to get a body change she's leaving the earth what do i need to do to get in repent repent of your thinking repent of your error on the promise say well what about all their adultery and lying don't worry you don't have to change none of that stuff get the holy ghost and it'll change all of that for you this gospel has never been a gospel trying to force a living stan a a certain kind of standard on us the gospel has standards but it's but it's a consequence of a new birth it's only listing and that way it's a barometer to you so that you can know where you are spiritually in christ if you have overcome the world there's nothing it's impossible for you to do that unless there has been a supernatural power come down and wash your mind and change your heart and give you the holy ghost that's the only way you can see the word of god and then that life in you produces godly living not you in fact is it so not you that you'll even still stumble and make mistakes and you'll have to go back and repent again but be of good cheer he that will repent god is faithful and just to forgive oh i'm so thankful for that i'm so thankful for that friends we have an advocate christ jesus so paul has made it so clear see so so now he says uh give me that 31st verse one more time brother jason uh i think we stopped too soon let me uh let i did l did i stop at 24. i know i stopped at um i stopped at um at 30. i did you're right all right let's read 30 and 31 again and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent verse 31 because there's a big reason why everybody needs to repent because he god hath appointed a day he hath appointed a day i didn't appoint it paul didn't point it peter john moses they didn't appoint it god appointed a day william branham didn't appoint it you didn't appoint it god hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead so there should be no doubt if you you know the the muslim faith their their messenger is still in his tomb i'm sorry if you think the buddha is noble which i'm sure is a nice guy he's still in his tomb there is only one man who was ever able to lay his life down and himself pick it back up again and he did and it's jesus amen and therefore god has so proven it to the world by that empty tomb that now you should take and have confidence in this fact this divine fact i don't care history changes the not not the history but the the the telling of it changes science changes amen well what they know now compared to what they used to know then most of it's turned upside down see and but but here's something that doesn't change at all when god declares something it's never going to change and therefore since he raised him from the dead and proved it to the world and now he's proving it in you and i he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness so as this appointed day neared then the bride in the earth at the end time as this because this appointed day is at the end and as this appointed day neared the bride in the earth would once again need the full healing of mind body and soul once again god would follow his exact same pattern he would send a prophet to declare he's here and he's moving and he's working in his people does that seem a stretch to you friend does that seem a stretch that god would do the same thing again i hope that's not a stretch in your mind i hope that you have known god in enough way that what i'm saying to you today is not some strange oh new gospel it's not a strange new gospel it's the original gospel it's the promise that god made many thousands years ago and he's come to this hour and fulfilled it and what is he doing he's restoring a bride tree and when and in that restoration he had to heal our minds he had to heal our minds of wrong thinking of denominational thinking of whatever the social fabric of the nation is feeling you know whether it's the far right or the far left they're they're all wrong this is the uh that's why i'm not a democrat or a republican i'm a christian hallelujah i i'm not a i'm not a race i'm a son of god amen god has made of one blood he's enjoined us all back to abraham hallelujah glory to god that's what we believe in here today that's why we have access to the power of god once again he would follow his pattern he would send a prophet now i i hope that's not a stretch to you today because i'm going to pile some responsibility on you this morning and it's on me too there has never been now i'm i'm maybe making my last turn and i'm gonna head for the finish line there has never been a time in the history of mankind when the family of god so needs so desperately needs to have an active and lively token on display you know why the appointed day is coming appointed day is already dropping around us and it makes our heart bleed because billions with a b billions will perish only an elect few will escape it now a nice large contingency will survive in israel a nice larger probably much larger contingency of gentiles will survive going through a tribulation and give their lives and receive eternal life at the judgment bar but i don't want to i don't want on that train because i might get there and lose my case i want to know that all my sins have already gone ahead of me and by the time i get there it's just brother jason take your take your seat on the throne oh i don't need to go oh no no jesus already stood down there for you your whole life now you go up here and sit with him hallelujah i i'm part of the restoration of the pride tree it's not just the church the church goes to the tribulation but the bride is called out of the church come up higher john that's what he heard in revelation 4 caught off of the earth caught into the presence of god see and so of course not um not not not not in the in the temple of god because that nobody can go there until the judgment is over we meet christ in the air you read revelation 15 and 16 you'll see all of that the the temple of heaven there's not they're not there the the seven judgment seven vile angels came out of there which of course would be the seven messengers to the gentile age because they carried a message of life and a message of judgment because it was a ministry of the son of man amen that's basic teaching and so so we realize that it is this message that will judge the seventh age and and and you say well my goodness why do the the foolish virgin have to go through such a horrible tribulation they didn't have to do that in during the ages yeah but they didn't have a message like this this age is guilty of of violating the greatest message since the days of jesus and so for that they're going to have to go through and suffer three and a half years of terrible torment and you know what's going to bring that judgment those seven those seven ages why did why do you think when when that cloud appeared over his head brother branham says what made that what now what does the white cloud mean judge and what made the cloud seven angels amen so so we see in revelation 15 that and revelation 16 these angels in linen they're absolutely correlates bible imagery of the messengers that he sent because their forever who received their message in their age received life and whoever rejected it then god dropped god he says god gathered brother m says god gathered all of his elect and took and laid him asleep and laid the messenger asleep and he dropped a temporary plague see but the vials are full that's full it's not a temporary it's not partial like under the trumpets a third of this a third of that a third of this a third of that that's because it's in prior prior to the tribulation but in the tribulation it's the vials and that's why the trumpets and the vials correlate if you ever go and read them side by side they're identical not that one's a fulfillment of the other it's just that god that would be impossible it's just that god is operating in the same way if i could say it like that god is operating in the same way and so the world that is rejecting this message today keep pleading with them keep pleading with them keep pleading with them because this same message if they keep rejecting it's going to judge them in the tribulation period so let us have a heart to reach out don't give up don't give up don't give up keep pressing keep loving keep reaching keep praying it's not over yet we can still find some go into the hedges and the highways of your life and compel them to come wow i didn't mean to get sidetracked this morning but but i i was actually going to maybe do that at the beginning but then i changed my mind and then i just felt to stab at it as i went by dr like a drive-by let's repeat this statement again because of the appointed day the appointed day as i've said to you before catastrophic cataclysmic judgments are rushing to meet us and the only way out is up up consequently there has never been a time in history the history of all humanity when the family of god so desperately needs to have an active and lively token on display you literally are the light of the world you literally are the pathway to someone's redemption now you can't redeem them you're the pathway to it you're the vessel god will use whomsoever sins you remit or remitted and whosoever is your retainer retained now don't take the catholic version of that that's not that's not us putting on black robes and sitting in the confessional booth that's you taking the gospel to them and trying to persuade them of the things of god and listen friends here's a beautiful thing they might can't understand this but they might understand you either way that would still lead them to redemption because if they could catch it in you and god changed their heart then they would understand it here there's never been a more important time we are at the appointed day your life should be a lively token it should be an active token you should not just be a flame you should be a burning blazing flame because the whole world is in darkness according to prophecy if there was ever a time if there was ever a time to show the love of god it's now if there was ever a time friends for you to be a beacon of hope if there was ever a time you know i was thinking about my daughter-in-law's testimony there in the school and the heart she has for those students if there was ever a time that we should be a beacon of hope a light in a dark world uh a a a a bastion of of strength and and faith and love and compassion it ought to be now see if there was ever a time when our hearts were to be filled with compassion if there was ever a time when we were willing to go into the hedges and into the highways of our daily life our daily life listen friends it's not just the cities and the streets it's the hedges and highways this is where the rubber meets the road this is where we live this is where we work this is where we shop this is this is us walking up and down the streets see if there was ever a time when we are to express the love and the compassion of christ in the hedges and highways of our lives and compel them to come to the feast it's now it's now do you believe that we're to be a burning light to light the darkness as the end looms it's it's irreversible and it's listen it's it's not up to you to decide i mean look i mean i already know this the same jesus that said you know go out and he sent him two by two and he sent him and i said i send you a sheep among wolves and he sent them out and and and at and and in pentecost he would scatter them and send them to the four corners of the of the world not that jesus expected the gospel would change the world save the world and and cancel the appointed day amen the appointed day wasn't going to get canceled because they started preaching the gospel that's a fact of scripture the all-knowing god knows that the all-knowing god that's why he could write it in the way he did in in the in the in the book of revelation that that the that there comes a time on this appointed day when when the sea gives up its dead and all the the the population of the earth both small and great stood before him who sat upon the throne and the heavens peeled back like a scroll me god opened up his giant tv screen that's going to play out their lives and even their thoughts and motives this you're talking about an epic event it's it's hard to get the scale there's no way your mind could even grasp the scale of what that's going to be billions upon billions upon billions down through all the ages are coming to the appointed day so we know that and and you shouldn't you shouldn't go out imagining you're going to save everybody you talk to you just get your feelings crushed and then you go hide in a hole but the the the reward is too great and the need is too great to hide we can't hide stop hiding stop yeah you need to take the scripture and says i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for it is the power of god unto salvation be bold hallelujah be brave go forward let your light shine don't be afraid they're going to the world in majority is going to think you're crazy they always have they always will that's just that's just fallen man that's the curse of sin that's what it is i mean in the days of of noah the whole world the bible says they covered sinful men covered the face of the earth and all their hearts and minds were evil continually and and god said send them a prophet that's divine interpreter of the word of god and he sends them a prophet and didn't do you know he didn't just do like brother branham 33 years of ministry noah had 120 years preaching that and at the end of it all only a hundred only eight people got on the boat got on the ark and and you say well that's pretty narrow out of the out of the whole face of the whole earth of all the population how many billions were there i don't know the face of the earth was covered with them and i know only eight people got on you say man that's pretty narrow that's nothing he only took one in a rapture only enoch only one human being out of all the face of the earth covered with people you say god said that's pretty cold of god no god god preached to him 120 years and pleaded with them and told them it's coming it's coming it's coming get in the safety why will you die don't die see but god only built the ark so so big it's only going to hold so many people because god already knows how many he's going to get on it don't tell me he doesn't have predestination if he doesn't how does he give no other dimensions 120 years before anybody gets on how does he give how does he give john the dimensions of the of the new jerusalem i know it's large yeah it's big half the united states and 1500 miles straight up i get that four point some odd million almost five million uh surface acres of land that's pretty big but i mean if god how did god give him the dimensions two thousand years ago if he doesn't know how many is going to live in it see so be sensible see don't don't be don't be children be be mature children of god and understand they they they didn't receive it in mass they didn't receive did they receive john and master they received jesus in mass did they receive the apostles in mass no they never have they never will that's not the point that's not on me that's not on you what's on me is to carry the gospel to go into the streets and the cities and go into the hedges and the highways and let your little light shine hallelujah see and so you know it's it's it's amazing how that you know when we talk about you know it's one thing to love a message if i'm standing here today and i'm going to close in just a few minutes i i'm feeling myself coming to the finish line i already know i won't get done so i'm not going to try it's it's one thing for all of us to and i mean i had to grapple with this oh it's great we can talk about go out with love and compassion see go out as a burning light go and take the love of god to the world see but but remember it's the opposite of compassion if your demonstration is carnality tell me and talk to me about let's love everybody let's show them compassion you know what i'm going to say to that amen hallelujah how about we go do it but it's the opposite of love and compassion if your light that's shining is is if your flame is lukewarm at the time when it's supposed to be the rising of the sun our flame is supposed to be the rising of the sun and if your light is a lukewarm light how is that love how is that compassion i'm going to tell you that kind of compassion is of the world it's what the devil wants you to believe he wants the world to believe it that it doesn't matter oh it matters i'm here to tell you it matters let us go out and fill our streets with love let us go into the hedges and the highways with compassion but let us be honest let us be flaming let us have the token on display because that's what god can get behind in your life he's not going to get behind lukewarmness he's not going to get behind carnality you're you're you're living a lie to the people that's why i said now now i'm circling back if there was ever a time in the history of humanity because the approaching day is upon us if there was ever a time that your your token should be on fire it should be on display the love of god should be compelling you if there was ever a time it's this time it's now here in may 2022 we don't even know if there will be a 2023. we don't even know if this year will finish out we don't even know if this month will finish out you don't even have a guarantee of life tomorrow oh i want to take i want to say lord god let me right now let me right now i want to take love to the world i want to take compassion there's never been a more important day this world needs a healing of its mind and god is wanting you to be a gospel preacher and take the revelation of the word that the people might can't understand it in here but they can understand it here they know what they see they know what they're around don't think they don't i'm gonna tell you something friends that's the kind of life that has the power of god in it and for me it's that or bust it's that i mean it's it's that or it's heaven or bust hallelujah i want the whole measure of the token life i want i want to have compassion on the world but i want to have honest compassion how about you stand with me friends we'll stop there i'm i got more to say i didn't i thought i might finish and i found out pretty quickly i wouldn't be able to i love him and he loves me and he loves the world he so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son i mean what more could he do how brother branham takes that whole message you want to hear a wonderful message put it on your your tape list this week you got a tape list right i hope so you might not be on paper but i hope you got one in your mind anyway put this one on your list he cares do you care and brother branham just takes that question does he care does he care oh my goodness does he care and he goes all the way back and takes this one out of the bible and this one out of the bible and so see jesus cared about that person god cared about that person brother adam tells a story in his own life here's a young man and a young woman he marries him and then the man loses his mind on his wedding night he loses his mind goes insane and and it's you know what you know what done it it's because he had a complex in his mind that he couldn't accept the forgiveness of god he couldn't accept the freedom that god gave him and he comes back and he's just sitting there in a stupor and the poor newlywed bride she's crying her eyes out because her life's ruined she's she's now connected to a man who's a nut case and and brother branham has to bring him back in and the grace of god and it goes down into his life and begins to release him and release him and release him and release him and releasing oh and he gets free and brother branham says see god cared about that young man oh he cares about you friends you don't have to be old you're young he cares about you you're single you're married you're male or female your boy or girl he cares do you care brother branham says he'll care but you got to care first you got to care enough to approach him and ask him say lord god would you come and help me in my life how many today friends just say lord god come help me in my life come lord jesus and help me father you see my struggles oh god you see my desire my heart i want to be right i want to be true i want to be faithful lord the world is wicked and i this flesh is weak but oh god i'm coming to you today and asking for your help now come lord jesus across this audience father move on young hearts and old hearts alike married and single move on one and all lord out across the airwaves move in their lives lord god let this word lord god as brother branham said let his word be my word let his thoughts be my thoughts let me tie it to the post of my heart whatever the world would come along try to make me do this that let me just think of jesus let me just keep my mind on jesus what would he do oh he was brother branham said he was full of faith he was full of love it was full of compassion for the people he loved his humanity they spit in his face he didn't spit back they slapped him and pulled his beard out he didn't jerk it theirs prophet said he walked on humbly he was full of faith he knew his words couldn't fail how where did that confidence come in the in the revelation of his identity he knew who he was he knew why he was here he told pilate that he told him for this cause came into the earth this is why i'm here that whoever will believe on me will have whoever believes on me and receive the truth they'll have life they'll be born again lord may we be faithful ambassadors of your love faithful ambassadors of your compassion don't let us fall for the trickery of the of the world of this modern ideology of christianity good people caught in that thing lord good people some of your children caught in that some of them may be part of the elect lady some of them may be part of the foolish virgin the remnant of the woman's seed they need to be found they need to be approached they need to be won from that from that darkness that's on the age help us to help them lord let us go in your name and in your power make our lives full of the holy spirit let our light shine as a burning flame may we reevaluate the hedges and highways of our lives lord right now with all heads bowed friends i wonder i told you i was going to lay some responsibility on you today with all heads bowed you want to let jesus see a hand your hand go up and say lord i'll take on that responsibility today i volunteer father i'm raising up my hand lord i raise up both of mine i volunteer lord i want to be an emissary i want to be an apostle of you i want to be lord an ambassador of the love of god to the world help us to be that lord help us to shine bright and true don't let the world go off into a tribulation and never have never have someone to demonstrate to them that you're not in manmade systems you you never have been but the world is sowed over in it lord in the masses overwhelmingly nearly a hundred percent only a small small little elect lady and a small remnant of the woman's seed they'll see past that in the in the tribulation they won't take the mark of the beast thank god somehow lord it'll they'll come to their senses but there's a little tiny bride lord that's made preparations now to not go into that judgment why because we've accepted the word which is a bleeding word which then lord is what forgives our sins omits our transgressions it it gives us a new birth we now father live according to the life of the son of god that life that i live now that faith that i have is the faith of the son of god not just faith in
