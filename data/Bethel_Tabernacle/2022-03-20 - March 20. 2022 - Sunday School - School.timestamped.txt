[2:07] you
[2:34] all right
[2:35] we on
[2:36] all right um let's all stand have a word
[2:39] of prayer
[2:42] your lord ask that you be with us this
[2:44] morning we invite you into our midst as
[2:46] you anoint the words that i'm going to
[2:47] speak and anoint my my thoughts and my
[2:50] spirit and anoint the ears of the people
[2:52] that might hear something we might be
[2:54] able to give them a little bit of a
[2:55] little extra ammo on their in their gun
[2:57] to fight the devil we ask these things
[2:58] in jesus name amen
[3:00] all right so i want to um
[3:02] start by um turning to
[3:06] mark chapter four
[3:15] we'll just read a quick scripture and
[3:17] have you all sit down
[3:26] um
[3:28] all right and so
[3:29] the first part of the chapter here is
[3:30] god giving some or jesus rather giving
[3:33] some parables
[3:34] and then it comes down to verse 10
[3:37] and it says and when he was alone
[3:40] they that were about him
[3:42] with the twelve asked
[3:45] of him the parable
[3:47] and he said unto them unto you it is
[3:49] given to know the mystery of the kingdom
[3:51] of god but unto him that are without all
[3:54] these things are done in parables
[3:56] that seeing they may see and not
[3:58] perceive in hearing that they may hear
[4:00] and not understand lest at any time they
[4:03] should be converted and their sins
[4:04] should be forgiven them
[4:07] um
[4:08] and then we i want to skip down to uh
[4:10] where to put that
[4:12] um and then come down to
[4:16] verse 33
[4:19] and um
[4:21] and with many such parables spake he the
[4:23] word unto them
[4:25] as they were able to hear it but without
[4:27] a parable spake he not
[4:30] um
[4:33] sorry without a parable speaking not
[4:35] unto them and when they were alone he
[4:37] expounded all things to his disciples
[4:39] and y'all can y'all can be seated so
[4:42] um
[4:44] i want to for a topic for a title i i
[4:47] put down the exclusivity of god because
[4:50] one of the things that i've i've seen
[4:51] throughout the bible and i'm sure we've
[4:52] we're all we've all seen is there's god
[4:55] throughout the entire bible has always
[4:57] drawn a line of separation between his
[4:58] family and the rest of the world
[5:00] um
[5:01] i mean you even see with and oftentimes
[5:05] that line does not run down human
[5:07] genetic lines either
[5:08] you see with abraham god told him to
[5:10] separate from his father and lot who is
[5:12] his cousin
[5:14] because there's there's a spiritual
[5:16] genetics and then there's a
[5:18] natural genetics and those two things
[5:19] are not always associated with each
[5:20] other
[5:21] very often times they're not
[5:23] and
[5:24] so but and so here we have
[5:27] jesus showing where he
[5:30] his message is not to everyone everyone
[5:33] can hear it but they're going to hear an
[5:35] encrypted version of it they're going to
[5:37] hear a version of it that's going to be
[5:39] um
[5:40] filtered through
[5:42] you know through parables and and it's
[5:44] not going to be clear
[5:46] but to the people to his exclusive
[5:48] people just the 12 around him they're
[5:50] going to get the
[5:53] unencrypted version of that
[5:56] um
[5:58] uh and and so i want to jump down to
[6:00] um
[6:02] uh verse 35 in chapter four and it says
[6:07] and the same day when the even was come
[6:09] he said unto them let us pass over onto
[6:11] the other side
[6:14] and when they had sent away the
[6:15] multitude they took him even as he was
[6:18] in the ship
[6:21] and there was also with him other little
[6:22] ships
[6:23] and there arose a great storm of wind
[6:25] and the waves beat into the ship so that
[6:28] it was now full
[6:30] and he was in the hindered part of the
[6:31] ship asleep on a pillow and they wake
[6:33] him saying to him master cares thou not
[6:36] that we perish and he arose and rebuked
[6:38] the wind and said unto the sea peace be
[6:40] still and the wind ceased and there was
[6:42] a great calm and he said unto them
[6:44] why are you so fearful how is it that
[6:47] you have have have no faith
[6:50] and they feared exceedingly and said one
[6:52] to another what manner of man is this
[6:53] that even the wind and the sea obey him
[6:56] now i want to point out something and
[6:58] i'm
[6:59] very familiar with this scripture i'm
[7:01] sure we all are but there was something
[7:03] that i picked up that i had never i was
[7:05] reading through the gospels again
[7:06] recently and i'd never caught this
[7:08] before and it says
[7:14] in verse 36
[7:28] and
[7:42] and it doesn't
[7:45] after the storm
[7:46] because the disciples boat was sinking
[7:49] they were gonna you know they were gonna
[7:50] sink if he hadn't calmed the storm and
[7:52] it doesn't mention those other boats now
[7:54] it's maybe a little bit of speculation i
[7:56] don't know because it doesn't say what
[7:58] happened to them
[7:59] but i
[8:00] i mean to me when i read this it shows
[8:02] that maybe god is causing this storm to
[8:05] come along
[8:06] to get rid of all the people who
[8:08] he he doesn't need there right here's
[8:10] these disciples
[8:12] and because they're going if you
[8:14] continue reading they're going to kadera
[8:16] to meet the the insane man in the tombs
[8:19] the devil possessed man and maybe god
[8:21] doesn't need all these people going
[8:23] there
[8:24] right um we'll pick it up later in um in
[8:27] the book of luke when he goes to
[8:29] um jarius's house to raise the dead
[8:32] daughter he has to kick all these people
[8:33] out of the house
[8:35] because their faith is so bad they have
[8:38] such little faith and they're so um
[8:40] distracted
[8:42] um or they so distract from from the
[8:45] miracle that's about to happen and so um
[8:47] they have such a doubt that he couldn't
[8:49] have raised that little girl if they'd
[8:50] have been there so so maybe and so
[8:53] a lot of times i find that when we're in
[8:55] when we're going through storms in our
[8:56] lives
[8:57] maybe the whole point of that is that
[8:58] god is trying to remove things
[9:01] he's trying to shake off all the other
[9:02] little boats in our lives because we're
[9:04] going into
[9:06] you know there's there's gonna be
[9:08] deliverance on the other side and you
[9:09] can't have all this other stuff causing
[9:11] doubt that maybe if all those other
[9:13] people would have showed up on the
[9:14] shores of gadara that devil possessed
[9:16] man might not have been able to get
[9:17] deliverance or maybe and this is the
[9:19] other thing and i i consider this as
[9:21] well because when those devils were cast
[9:23] out they would god sent them into the
[9:25] pigs if there's a big crowd there maybe
[9:27] god doesn't need a big crowd there
[9:28] because in dealing with that those
[9:30] people might have been under attack by
[9:31] those devils when they left that man you
[9:33] don't necessarily know it might not
[9:35] necessarily have been that they were bad
[9:37] people because they were following jesus
[9:39] after all it might have just been that
[9:40] it was almost for their own good that
[9:42] god would have put that storm
[9:44] in the lives of those people
[9:45] particularly
[9:47] because of what they where they were
[9:48] going and what they were doing wow
[9:51] so
[9:52] um
[9:54] so i i um
[9:57] uh let's see here
[9:59] um
[10:00] and and or we could look at it at the
[10:02] sake uh added sort of another
[10:04] perspective and that is
[10:06] as i mentioned before the exclusivity of
[10:07] god that here is god's chosen people the
[10:10] 12 in this boat these are the god's
[10:12] closest people the jesus's closest
[10:14] people
[10:15] people that he's hand picking
[10:17] and their boat's the only one that makes
[10:19] it
[10:20] right because and
[10:22] and we see all the chaos and things
[10:24] around us
[10:25] in the world i mean craziness you got
[10:27] the russia and
[10:29] trying to create bonds with china and
[10:31] what's going to happen with the monetary
[10:32] system and gas prices are four dollars a
[10:34] gallon and it's there you know experts
[10:36] are saying it's going to go even higher
[10:37] and all the crazy things that are
[10:38] happening all the storms that are
[10:40] hitting the world right now
[10:41] and all the little boats are getting hit
[10:43] but there's only one boat going to make
[10:44] it out and that's the one with jesus in
[10:46] it
[10:47] right
[10:48] and so it's and now the only people who
[10:50] are going to be in that boat are the
[10:52] ones that jesus has hand-picked
[10:55] right he didn't hand pick all because
[10:57] and we'll pick this up again hopefully
[10:58] if we have time
[11:00] running through my time um
[11:02] there's a
[11:04] there's a point at which there there are
[11:06] many disciples because it actually says
[11:08] here um if we read that
[11:10] go back up where it talks about
[11:12] uh in
[11:13] verse 10
[11:15] um
[11:16] it said um
[11:18] when he was alone and they that were
[11:20] about him with the twelve
[11:22] so there were other disciples and and
[11:24] talks about this later when he talks
[11:26] about um eating my flesh and drinking my
[11:28] blood and all they were all like oh how
[11:29] can we hear this is so this is he's a
[11:31] cannibal
[11:32] right well it talked about how all the
[11:34] disciples left yeah so he had many
[11:36] disciples but there were only 12
[11:38] hand-picked one that he picked himself
[11:41] lots of people heard his teachings and
[11:42] came to him
[11:44] but only the ones that were specifically
[11:46] chosen the specific ones
[11:48] like the exclusive people who actually
[11:51] stuck through them stuck with it
[11:54] through all the all the difficulties
[11:57] and um so i actually want to uh
[11:59] uh oh i'm sorry i didn't mean luke i
[12:01] meant john um so i want to jump down to
[12:05] john chapter six
[12:08] um
[12:13] oh
[12:16] um and we'll start at verse one
[12:18] and it says after these things jesus
[12:20] went over the sea of galilee
[12:23] which is the sea of tiberias and a great
[12:26] multitude followed him because they saw
[12:28] his miracles which he did um
[12:31] uh on them that were diseased and jesus
[12:34] went up into a mountain and there he sat
[12:36] with his disciples and the passover a
[12:38] feast of the jews was nigh when jesus
[12:40] then lifted up his eyes and saw a great
[12:42] company come unto him he said unto
[12:44] philip when shall we buy bread that they
[12:46] may eat
[12:49] um and this he said to prove to prove
[12:51] him for he himself knew what he would do
[12:54] philip answered him 200 penny worth of
[12:57] bread is not sufficient for them
[12:59] that every one of them uh may take a
[13:03] little um
[13:06] let's see
[13:09] um and of his disciples andrew simon
[13:11] peter's brother said unto him there's a
[13:13] lad here which have uh five barley
[13:15] loaves and two small fishes but what are
[13:17] they among so many and jesus said make
[13:20] the men sit down and there was much
[13:22] grass in the place of the men sat down
[13:24] in number about five thousand
[13:27] and jesus took the loaves and when he
[13:29] had given thanks he distributed to the
[13:31] disciples and disciples to them that
[13:33] were sat down and likewise of the fishes
[13:35] as much as they would
[13:38] and when they were filled he said unto
[13:40] his disciples gather up the fragments
[13:42] that remain that nothing be lost and
[13:44] therefore they gathered them together
[13:46] and filled 12 baskets
[13:48] with the fragments of the five barley
[13:50] loaves which remained over and above
[13:53] them that had eaten
[13:54] um
[13:56] and so we we know this story um it's
[13:58] pretty uh we you know
[14:00] i mean you get through sunday school
[14:02] you're going to hear the story um
[14:04] but and then i want to jump down
[14:07] to
[14:08] um
[14:10] verse 22.
[14:12] um and the day following
[14:14] when the people stood
[14:16] on the other side of the sea oh
[14:18] so let me let me pick something else
[14:19] here before i move on um so between that
[14:22] story and the
[14:24] um where i'm picking up now is a story
[14:26] in which the the disciples go out on the
[14:28] boat
[14:30] and jesus walks in the water and meets
[14:31] them out in the sea okay
[14:34] and so
[14:35] they they get to the other side and so
[14:37] here's all these other people the people
[14:38] they left behind who had gotten
[14:40] they he where he just fed 5 000 they're
[14:43] also still waiting on the near side of
[14:45] the side of the shore
[14:46] and that's where we're picking up in
[14:48] verse 22.
[14:49] and the day following when the people
[14:51] which stood on the other side of the sea
[14:53] saw there was none um other boat there
[14:57] save that one where unto his disciples
[15:00] were entered and that jesus went not
[15:02] with his disciples into the boat but
[15:04] that his disciples were gone away alone
[15:07] how big there came um other boats from
[15:10] tiberias i under the place
[15:12] where he did eat bread after that the
[15:14] lord had given thanks
[15:16] when the people therefore saw that jesus
[15:18] was not there neither his disciples they
[15:21] also took shipping and came to capernaum
[15:23] seeking for jesus so here's all these
[15:25] people they just get a big belly full
[15:27] because jesus feeds feeds them all on
[15:29] five loaves and two fishes and they're
[15:31] like wow this is crazy we gotta follow
[15:33] this guy and so they all jump in boats
[15:35] and cross the sea looking for him okay
[15:38] um
[15:41] uh and then it comes down we're gonna
[15:43] come down
[15:44] to
[15:45] um
[15:48] uh
[15:49] okay and it says and when they had found
[15:51] him on the other side of the sea
[15:53] they said unto him rabbi when cometh
[15:55] thou hither
[15:57] and jesus answered them and said verily
[15:59] verily i say unto you
[16:00] ye seek me not because he saw the
[16:03] miracles
[16:05] not because ye saw the miracles but
[16:07] because you did eat of the loaves and
[16:09] were filled
[16:10] labor not for the meat which perisheth
[16:13] but for that meat which endureth unto
[16:15] everlasting life which the son of man
[16:17] shall give unto you for him hath god the
[16:19] father sealed
[16:21] then said they unto him what shall we do
[16:23] that we might work the works of god
[16:26] jesus answered and said unto them
[16:28] this is the work of god that ye believe
[16:29] on
[16:30] him whom he hath sent
[16:34] and they said therefore unto him what
[16:36] signs show us thou then and see let's
[16:38] let's catch this they said therefore
[16:40] unto him
[16:41] what sign show us thou then that we may
[16:44] see and believe thee
[16:46] what dost thou work
[16:48] show us a sign you're saying that you're
[16:50] of god show us a sign that you're of god
[16:52] okay
[16:53] our fathers did eat manna in the desert
[16:55] as it is written he gave them bread from
[16:58] heaven to eat
[16:59] then jesus said unto them verily verily
[17:00] i say unto you moses gave you not that
[17:02] bread from heaven but my father giveth
[17:05] you that true
[17:06] giveth you the true bread from heaven
[17:09] for the bread of god is he which cometh
[17:11] down from heaven and giveth life unto
[17:13] the world
[17:14] so
[17:15] here's a bunch of people
[17:18] who one day
[17:20] a man multiplied bread in front of them
[17:23] they ate it they crossed the ocean and
[17:25] then asked him well moses gave us bread
[17:27] from heaven what can you do
[17:30] right
[17:32] he he literally gave them the sign that
[17:33] they were looking for
[17:35] he'd done it right in front of him they
[17:37] ate it
[17:38] right they ate the same bread they had
[17:40] literally partaken of the sign and
[17:41] completely missed it
[17:44] right
[17:45] and
[17:47] and so this is why jesus isn't giving
[17:49] him an inch
[17:50] because he's recognizing that they're
[17:52] they're not his exclusive people
[17:54] right
[17:55] the disciples the 12 that were with him
[17:57] they recognized
[17:59] because
[18:00] you know they were with them through the
[18:02] thick and the thin
[18:03] and in different different gospels kind
[18:05] of show different things um
[18:07] not every gospel has all the same
[18:08] stories and if you if you parallel these
[18:10] stories together you see that right
[18:13] around this time is when he goes up one
[18:15] mountain transfiguration it's right
[18:17] around this time that that peter's
[18:18] saying well surely you're the son of god
[18:21] it's the 12 are recognizing who he is
[18:24] okay
[18:25] and if we keep reading down um which i
[18:28] think i'm going to have to maybe uh i
[18:30] might have to skip some of this because
[18:32] of time
[18:33] um
[18:36] and i want to come down um
[18:43] uh
[18:46] and so the i guess i guess where i'm i'm
[18:49] coming to is
[18:51] at the end of this story it's when he's
[18:53] talk is where he hits them with the um
[18:55] you know you eat my eat my flesh drink
[18:57] my blood you know this is the bread of
[18:59] life and this is where they they get all
[19:02] they get all put off
[19:04] right all these people who had followed
[19:05] him across the ocean are suddenly like
[19:07] well okay we don't understand this
[19:09] and so
[19:11] what this is showing is
[19:13] this and we know this is jesus did this
[19:15] on purpose he did this to separate
[19:18] all the people
[19:20] away from him
[19:22] who weren't his his selected few
[19:25] right only the 12 stuck around because
[19:27] he turned to them and well aren't you
[19:28] going to leave two and they said well no
[19:29] you have the words of eternal life
[19:31] so what's the what's the what's the the
[19:34] takeaway from this is that a lot of
[19:35] times god is going to either through
[19:38] storms or just through
[19:41] the hardness of doctrine you might say
[19:44] going to separate people
[19:46] a lot of times there's gonna be a lot
[19:48] there's gonna be a lot of crowds but if
[19:50] you're holding to the word and holding
[19:52] to the message of the hour as close at
[19:55] it to the letter a lot of people are
[19:57] going to look at that and turn away
[19:59] because they're not
[20:01] they're not seeing
[20:02] they're not the chosen few who have seen
[20:06] the the the living christ in that
[20:08] right
[20:10] and so
[20:12] and so
[20:13] and we know that god does this on
[20:14] purpose because he's he's being
[20:16] exclusive he's being selective he only
[20:18] wants those chosen few right now
[20:21] everyone has an opportunity and this is
[20:23] this is a um
[20:25] uh something that
[20:26] i know i struggled with for a lot of my
[20:28] life and until brother jason actually
[20:30] clarified something for me and that is
[20:33] everybody has a chance
[20:35] to do this but genetics are still
[20:37] genetics god doesn't pick his family
[20:39] necessarily
[20:40] you just are who you are because of what
[20:43] your genetics are there's a there's a
[20:45] spiritual genetics and there's a natural
[20:46] genetics and those two things might
[20:48] necessarily um run in parallel but you
[20:52] still have spiritual spiritual genetics
[20:54] and it's not like god is going out and
[20:55] picking winners and losers it's just
[20:56] that some people are his kids and some
[20:57] people aren't
[20:59] right
[21:00] you know and and the other side of this
[21:03] and so i was it was actually this
[21:04] morning i was thinking about this i'm
[21:05] like well
[21:06] it's kind of hard for me to identify
[21:08] with that i guess because i don't have
[21:10] kids i mean i am somebody's kid but it's
[21:12] it's kind of hard to see it from god's
[21:14] perspective because i don't it's
[21:15] different but then i did realize one
[21:17] thing
[21:18] the other thing that is very exclusive
[21:20] is a marriage
[21:21] i am married
[21:23] and i know that
[21:25] i'm exclusive with my wife because
[21:28] that's
[21:29] what a marriage is if you god has to be
[21:32] exclusive with his bride because
[21:33] otherwise it's not a marriage
[21:35] right
[21:36] the whole the whole purpose the whole
[21:39] the whole uh plan of salvation was
[21:43] for god to be exclusive
[21:45] to to create a family that he that is
[21:47] exclusively his because the entire world
[21:49] is not
[21:51] fit to be god's bride
[21:53] not everyone wants to be god's bride not
[21:55] everyone wants to be married to god and
[21:56] so there's a lot of people who in
[21:58] today's age gets really
[22:00] bothered because there's this whole
[22:02] spirit of the age about oh well
[22:05] inclusivity
[22:06] everyone's got to be included we can't
[22:08] exclude anybody nobody you know
[22:10] everything's got to be for everybody you
[22:13] know everything's got to be for
[22:14] everybody
[22:15] well
[22:16] is it though god doesn't think that way
[22:18] right not everything is it god isn't for
[22:21] everybody
[22:23] um you know there were in the garden of
[22:25] eden there was adam and eve and those
[22:26] were god's children the serpent and
[22:29] the bible doesn't really mention a mrs
[22:31] serpent but if there was they wouldn't
[22:32] be part of god's family
[22:34] right and so the whole problem the whole
[22:37] fall of man was down to eve not being
[22:41] exclusive
[22:43] and
[22:45] so clearly this is going to create a
[22:47] situation in which case god has to be
[22:49] exclusive
[22:51] god and it's and and um
[22:54] a lot of people this hurts a lot of
[22:56] people's feelings because it's like well
[22:58] it's not fair it's not fair the people
[23:00] who aren't
[23:01] it's you know nothing that you can
[23:02] really do
[23:04] well
[23:06] you know it and it's it's almost like
[23:08] it's hard it's a hard thing to think
[23:09] about drawing lines of separation
[23:11] because you know
[23:13] we know that a lot of times like i said
[23:15] before a lot of times those lines aren't
[23:17] necessarily on human genetic lines a lot
[23:19] of times the lines of separation run
[23:20] down the middle of middles of family
[23:23] of human family and it and it hurts a
[23:25] lot
[23:26] um
[23:27] or even through you know through friends
[23:29] and things like that
[23:30] um
[23:32] but i want to pick up something
[23:36] from i want to read chap isaiah chapter
[23:38] 39
[23:39] with the last couple minutes that i've
[23:41] got here
[23:43] um
[23:52] it's a pretty short chapter and i'm
[23:53] going to try to read the whole thing
[23:56] um and it says at that time
[23:58] uh meredith balon the son of baylen king
[24:01] of babylon sent letters and presents to
[24:03] hezekiah for he had heard that he had
[24:06] been sick and was recovered
[24:08] and hezekiah was glad of them and showed
[24:10] them the house of his precious things
[24:12] the silver and the gold
[24:15] and the spices and the precious ointment
[24:17] and all the um
[24:19] and all the house of his armor and all
[24:21] that was found in his treasures there
[24:23] was nothing in his house nor in all his
[24:25] dominion that hezekiah showed them not
[24:29] then came isaiah the prophet unto king
[24:31] hezekiah and said unto him
[24:33] what said these men and from whence came
[24:37] they unto thee and hezekiah said
[24:40] there come from a far country unto me
[24:42] even from babylon
[24:43] then said he
[24:45] what have they seen in thine house and
[24:47] hezekiah answered all that is in mine
[24:49] house have they seen there is nothing
[24:50] among my treasures that i have not
[24:52] showed them
[24:53] then said isaiah to hezekiah hear the
[24:55] word of the lord of hosts behold the
[24:57] days the days come that all that is in
[25:01] thine house and that which thy fathers
[25:03] have laid up in store unto this day
[25:05] shall be carried to babylon nothing
[25:07] shall be left saith the lord and thy
[25:09] sons shall issue from thee
[25:12] which thou shalt begat shall they take
[25:15] away and they shall be eunuchs in the
[25:17] palace of the king of babylon then he
[25:20] said hezekiah
[25:21] then said hezekiah to isaiah
[25:23] good is the word of the lord
[25:25] which thou hast spoken he said moreover
[25:28] for there shall be peace and truth in my
[25:30] days
[25:31] so
[25:34] this is
[25:36] you know
[25:36] we've heard this story a lot and what it
[25:38] really comes down to is here's hezekiah
[25:40] who was a good king he was
[25:42] you know he was the first king to walk
[25:46] you know in all the ways of god
[25:47] according to his father david right he
[25:49] completely destroyed all these idols he
[25:51] had been this absolute champion for the
[25:53] for the word of the lord and then at the
[25:55] end
[25:57] his his whole kingdom kind of comes
[25:59] apart
[26:00] because
[26:01] some people outside of the family of god
[26:04] outside of israel came to him with some
[26:06] gifts and some nice words and said wow
[26:08] we heard that you were sick and you got
[26:10] better and you know we just brought you
[26:12] a present to tell you how much we
[26:13] appreciate that you got sick and we like
[26:14] you so much
[26:15] and he went and made friends with him
[26:17] and they got he got really close to some
[26:19] people who were outside
[26:22] of the family of god
[26:23] because they showed him some kindness
[26:26] and he wasn't supposed to have done that
[26:29] and the reason he wasn't supposed to
[26:30] have done that it wasn't
[26:32] it was because they were false at the
[26:34] end of the day those people were under
[26:36] the dominion of satan
[26:39] and the en who's the enemy of god
[26:42] no matter how nice people are outside of
[26:46] you know the message of the hour you
[26:48] have to be careful because anyone who's
[26:51] not holy ghost filled
[26:53] is
[26:54] a pawn of satan he they're under his
[26:56] control and that's that's an unfortunate
[26:58] thing but it's the it's the fact
[27:00] and here you have hezekiah
[27:03] making a lot of he's going and showing
[27:07] off his kingdom oh you know making
[27:08] friends with him looking oh look at how
[27:10] wonderful all my things are and look at
[27:12] how rich i am and you know really
[27:14] showing them a good time taking them all
[27:16] the you know the nice places and and
[27:18] maybe throwing him a nice party
[27:21] failing to recognize that those people
[27:22] are only there
[27:24] to to spy him out so that babylon can
[27:27] come in and take all that stuff from him
[27:29] right he's showing them all the wealth
[27:31] that he has
[27:32] not realizing that they weren't there
[27:35] on god's behalf they're there on satan's
[27:37] behalf
[27:38] right and so
[27:40] this is the reason why god draws lines
[27:42] of exclusivity between his family and
[27:44] the rest of the world
[27:46] because at the end of the day those
[27:48] people who
[27:50] you end up making really deep
[27:51] connections with who are not part of
[27:53] god's family
[27:56] they're the ones who are going to end up
[27:58] causing you a lot of heartache they're
[28:00] the ones who are going to end up taking
[28:01] things from you spiritually
[28:04] and
[28:06] it
[28:07] a lot of times it's painful and it's not
[28:09] fun and especially when people are nice
[28:10] and they're they have a nice exterior
[28:12] they're very they're very respectful and
[28:14] things
[28:15] but you still have to be careful about
[28:18] who you are
[28:20] um
[28:21] as i said
[28:24] creating very deep emotional ties to
[28:27] because it's it's as you know again when
[28:30] i was a teenager brother jason said
[28:31] something that really
[28:32] struck me and it's always stuck with me
[28:34] through my whole life and that is
[28:35] a lot of time god builds a wall around
[28:37] his people a wall of separation around
[28:40] his people and you can either look at it
[28:42] as a prison or you can look at it like a
[28:45] fortress
[28:47] either one you don't go out in in
[28:50] afghanistan and iraq or just any any you
[28:52] know foreign uh expedition the u.s goes
[28:55] on they're going to build bases out in
[28:57] the form in the enemy territory and they
[28:59] have the wire they call it the wire
[29:00] right it's the barbed wire they put
[29:02] around the base and they when you talk
[29:04] about going outside the wire you're no
[29:05] longer in the protective
[29:07] barrier around that base and if you're
[29:09] going outside the wire
[29:12] to go create relationships with people
[29:14] outside that wire you don't know
[29:17] what's going to come with that there's a
[29:18] famous story in afghanistan of a u.s
[29:21] soldier who
[29:23] he's he's there he's at the base he's in
[29:25] some foreign city he creates a
[29:27] relationship with a girl a local a
[29:29] native girl there
[29:30] um and he starts doing what he's not
[29:33] supposed to do and he starts sneaking
[29:34] outside the wire to go see her well one
[29:36] day he goes to go have dinner with her
[29:38] and her cousins and brothers are there
[29:39] and they kill him
[29:41] because they were taliban
[29:43] and he didn't know that and the whole
[29:45] thing was a lure
[29:46] and he wills and creates a relationship
[29:48] with someone outside the wire and a lot
[29:50] of times we have to be careful and so
[29:53] in his mind he's thinking oh this this
[29:55] this barricade around this base it's
[29:56] it's containing me it's holding me back
[29:59] it's it's holding me in
[30:00] but the reality is no it's to keep the
[30:03] people who are
[30:05] in the control of satan from harming you
[30:08] and you have to be very
[30:12] careful and very selective and
[30:14] and build those strong ties with the
[30:16] people
[30:17] within your fortress and uh
[30:20] we're
[30:21] we're uh out of time here so we'll stand
[30:23] and have a word of prayer
[30:28] lord ask that you
[30:29] we thank you for this this word that
[30:31] you've given us as they would be able to
[30:33] help the people and whatever they might
[30:34] be dealing with and give them some uh
[30:36] some uh
[30:38] an edge to fight the devil we thank you
[30:40] for this and dismiss the people uh into
[30:42] the service and the worship service as
[30:43] you bless the servants to come we thank
[30:45] you in jesus name amen
[31:45] you
[32:35] yes
[33:02] you
