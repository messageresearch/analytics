[38:35] visitors glad to see you all wonderful
[38:37] smiling faces amen we're going to look
[38:40] at mark 16 this morning just a couple of
[38:42] verses
[38:44] very familiar to us and i'm sure you
[38:46] would expect
[38:47] this scripture on an easter morning
[38:50] it's actually the uh part of the text at
[38:52] least uh that brother branham took for
[38:54] the message it is the rising of the sun
[38:57] mark 16 verses 1
[38:59] and 2
[39:01] and when the sabbath was passed
[39:04] mary magdalene and mary the mother of
[39:07] james and salome
[39:09] had brought sweet spices that they might
[39:11] come and anoint him and very early in
[39:15] the morning the first day of the week
[39:18] they came into the sepulcher at the
[39:20] rising of the sun
[39:23] father we thank you for your word this
[39:25] morning
[39:26] a brief reading lord is all that's
[39:28] necessary when it's your word one of
[39:30] your words lord could create worlds
[39:33] father we have a great confidence in
[39:35] your word today and i pray now that you
[39:38] will help me
[39:39] to deliver the burden of the word that i
[39:42] have for the people
[39:43] that'll only work if i can get myself
[39:46] out of the way lord and let you operate
[39:48] your own gift it's not mine it's yours
[39:51] it's for your glory it's all for you all
[39:53] for jesus all for jesus lord now bless
[39:57] bless both speaker and hearer today in
[40:00] the visible audience and those across
[40:03] the air we pray in jesus name amen god
[40:07] bless you friends you can be seated
[40:23] if you will bring up my uh oh thank you
[40:25] sir my powerpoint i want to speak on
[40:29] a topic today called life interrupted
[40:33] and it's been something that i've been
[40:35] working on for some number of weeks
[40:37] wasn't really sure it would work out for
[40:39] easter
[40:40] until the lord began to put all the
[40:42] pieces together for me and i want to
[40:46] bring a subtitle along with this
[40:49] advance one place brother mark and this
[40:52] is our return to sabbath i want you to
[40:56] notice
[40:57] that in the scripture
[40:59] they came
[41:01] very early in the morning the first day
[41:03] of the week
[41:04] all right so it starts out in our verse
[41:07] by saying when sabbath was passed so
[41:10] then you would find that they came to
[41:13] the sepulcher on early on a sunday
[41:16] morning
[41:17] because that was the first day of the
[41:19] week remember that the sabbath is the
[41:22] seventh day of the week
[41:25] which is saturday and so but we realize
[41:27] that as christians we don't come as
[41:30] christians we don't gather
[41:32] uh on the sabbath we gather on the first
[41:35] day of the week because that's the day
[41:38] he rose amen have you heard the
[41:41] wonderful news going around the world
[41:43] today
[41:43] he has risen
[41:45] amen hallelujah if it wasn't for that
[41:48] then our all of our hope would be in
[41:50] vain isn't that true
[41:52] so our life has been interrupted but we
[41:57] are on our return to a sabbath now by
[41:59] that i mean say well why aren't we
[42:01] headed to the first day of the week well
[42:03] we will in the new heavens and the new
[42:05] earth but first we got to go back and
[42:08] pick up that last week that got
[42:10] interrupted in genesis and that's what
[42:12] the millennium is about the millennium
[42:15] is the seventh day they never got to
[42:17] finish it it was supposed to be the rest
[42:20] amen but sin come in and interrupted and
[42:22] started the whole thing rolling so god
[42:25] is coming in our day to take a bride
[42:28] from the earth and go back
[42:30] and say because god never starts
[42:32] something he doesn't finish
[42:33] and he's not going to be defeated by the
[42:35] devil remember brother branham says he
[42:36] wasn't content god just wasn't content
[42:39] to see his creation laying there face
[42:42] down in ruin in the mud he said because
[42:44] he's he's god and he's not going to be
[42:47] defeated i'm glad that he's god and he's
[42:50] not going to be defeated amen that's the
[42:53] kind of being that i want operating my
[42:56] life
[42:58] if if he's an all-powerful being and
[43:01] then why wouldn't i why wouldn't you
[43:03] want him to be the lord of your life
[43:05] listen friends if if if lucifer has no
[43:09] authority over god's family
[43:13] uh and he has plenty of power now don't
[43:15] get me wrong satan has lots of power he
[43:18] actually he has power equal to god only
[43:21] except in creation god excels him satan
[43:24] can't create things amen
[43:26] so we find but god didn't create himself
[43:28] a 90-pound weakling god created himself
[43:31] a a worthy adversary and he's god's
[43:35] enemy and he's my enemy is he your enemy
[43:38] today
[43:39] and so we realized that calvary was a
[43:42] great victory
[43:44] of our god over our enemy and i i just
[43:48] surmise to myself when i think to myself
[43:51] i say you know uh if if if i don't live
[43:54] by the mercies of lucifer
[43:57] and if he has no authority over me
[44:01] and in fact uh any power that he does
[44:05] have he can't even exercise it against
[44:08] me except by my father's permission
[44:11] then why would i not serve my father
[44:16] why in the world would anyone serve the
[44:18] devil and
[44:20] instead of the one who has all the power
[44:22] and all authority in heaven and earth
[44:24] and has jurisdiction over your life
[44:28] it's the most foolish to serve the enemy
[44:34] i want to come to this first day
[44:38] of the week and
[44:39] and brother branham is going to
[44:42] make a statement here and
[44:44] i i
[44:45] don't know that i've maybe if i've ever
[44:48] done this i don't remember it in 20
[44:49] almost 28 years
[44:51] but i i felt impressed upon my heart i
[44:54] have a number of quotes i actually just
[44:56] one quote from one service
[44:58] but it's got several paragraphs and i i
[45:01] wanna i put it in my powerpoint and the
[45:04] brothers are going to play
[45:06] god's prophet saying these words and
[45:08] this was impressed upon me by the holy
[45:10] spirit i was reticent to do it because i
[45:12] don't normally do it but i felt led to
[45:14] do it all right so i want you to go with
[45:17] me just for a few minutes takes three or
[45:19] four minutes
[45:20] back to yesteryear to a prophet standing
[45:23] preaching a sermon it is the rising of
[45:27] the sun let's let's have that with good
[45:29] volume brothers
[45:33] and you're going to hear that one of my
[45:34] favorite quotes about how satan doesn't
[45:37] care how religious you are you're going
[45:38] to hear that in here amen if technology
[45:41] doesn't fail us if it does then i'll
[45:43] read it anyway
[45:45] amen praise the lord i think we can get
[45:47] it though
[45:55] be patient son
[46:01] does it look promising
[46:11] we'll get
[46:12] it
[46:14] everybody look at each other and say
[46:15] he's risen
[46:17] it's a glorious day
[46:20] praise the lord
[46:27] if it's not going to go it's no it's not
[46:28] the end of the world yeah
[46:32] what are you doing g
[46:35] come back to it
[46:38] preach my sermon upside down
[46:43] oh i've never done that well i said this
[46:45] i've never rarely done this so
[46:48] amen the enemy's fighting it paul said
[46:50] he purposed to come to a certain church
[46:52] he said but satan hindered me so amen
[46:55] satan certainly uh
[46:57] you know we we call him murphy but
[46:59] that's just a polite name for the devil
[47:02] amen praise the lord
[47:05] all right i'm not going to uh delay so
[47:08] uh if you can get it in
[47:10] 17 seconds
[47:36] that wonderful
[47:51] and when he died
[47:52] germany is born for our sins
[47:56] but then there's
[47:57] many
[47:59] fine little babies
[48:02] and there's been many man that
[48:16] now that it is the greatest
[48:20] week in history
[48:22] the greatest celebration of all time
[48:26] this easter is where he proves
[48:29] what he is
[48:34] um
[49:23] but this is not the real thing
[49:28] and that's
[49:38] um
[50:07] think about that
[50:21] [Music]
[50:30] won't come up
[50:49] from the dead
[50:54] is
[50:58] [Music]
[51:08] what a question
[51:12] [Music]
[51:23] [Music]
[51:25] that was 2 000
[51:27] years ago
[51:28] [Music]
[51:31] man 2 000 years ago
[51:35] what does it mean to me
[51:37] what does it mean to you
[51:40] now we believe
[51:41] by faith
[51:43] that he raised from the dead i don't
[51:45] think you'd be here if you didn't
[51:46] believe that
[51:47] you believe he raised from the dead if
[51:50] you don't you might as well go eat drink
[51:52] and be merry tomorrow we die at least
[51:54] you'll you know have some fun before the
[51:56] judgment but we find
[51:58] that we do believe he raised from the
[52:01] dead but what does that but what has
[52:04] that got to do with me
[52:07] that was 2 000 years ago
[52:13] one of the
[52:15] largest contributing factors i would say
[52:18] to so much tradition as brother branham
[52:21] would refer to it and people so worried
[52:24] about keeping tradition
[52:26] the largest contributing factor i find
[52:30] would be a lack of understanding
[52:33] all
[52:34] that calvary stood for
[52:36] everything that that day
[52:39] on calvary
[52:41] uh and
[52:42] not only not only what it stood for
[52:45] and represented in the past
[52:48] but what it pretended for the future
[52:51] the the resurrection and this is a very
[52:54] important part we're here today to say
[52:58] he's risen and we celebrate the
[53:00] resurrection the resurrection was a
[53:03] single and very integral part of a
[53:07] larger plan called redemption
[53:13] so even redemption is in two parts
[53:15] coming out of and going into there is a
[53:19] purchasing act that christ did at
[53:21] calvary and then there is a claiming act
[53:24] that he does at the last day when all
[53:26] the saints come from the grave and we
[53:29] which are alive and remain are changed
[53:31] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[53:35] so we find that it had
[53:37] other parts of the plan
[53:40] that preceded it
[53:42] in the old testament
[53:44] and more parts that were to come after
[53:48] the resurrection there is
[53:50] a representation of that day on calvary
[53:54] all through old testament imagery i'm
[53:56] not here today to take uh so much of a
[53:59] bible study on that but uh the old
[54:01] testament is replete with all of the
[54:03] imagery of christ it's all about jesus
[54:05] christ brother branham said he's in
[54:07] every verse and every line if you can't
[54:09] read him there go back and read it again
[54:11] and keep reading it till god shows you
[54:13] the relevance of how it's christ see
[54:16] so we find that there would be
[54:19] no resurrection we would not be here
[54:22] gathered today we wouldn't be calling it
[54:24] the greatest week of all weeks there
[54:27] would be no resurrection if there had
[54:29] not been a promise
[54:31] from isaiah kept by god
[54:35] god testifying through isaiah god isaiah
[54:39] couldn't bring that to pass a prophet
[54:42] couldn't cause it all he could do is be
[54:44] a microphone all he could do is channel
[54:46] the word of god to the people but it
[54:48] took god for that day on calvary to come
[54:52] to pass
[54:54] there had to be before
[54:56] before there was a resurrection there
[54:58] would be no resurrection had there not
[55:00] been a worthy life lived
[55:03] and a willing surrender
[55:06] of
[55:07] all
[55:08] even to death
[55:10] so i i want you to feel the
[55:13] the weight of that this morning i want
[55:15] you to feel the responsibility of that
[55:17] this morning because you haven't you
[55:19] haven't made a decision to attend a
[55:21] church that's that's here as a tradition
[55:24] to us easter is not a mere tradition
[55:28] easter
[55:30] what what they call easter what we call
[55:32] the resurrection we call it as a prophet
[55:35] called us called it the greatest week in
[55:38] history
[55:41] but it couldn't have come if a promise
[55:43] hadn't been kept by god
[55:45] it couldn't have come had there not been
[55:47] a worthy life and a willingness to
[55:49] surrender everything
[55:51] even to death itself the resurrection
[55:53] the ascension
[55:55] and the return of his life into his
[55:57] kingdom of saints
[55:59] was planned before stars
[56:05] god's never been figuring this out as he
[56:07] goes and i'm here to tell you you ought
[56:10] to be thankful there's nothing you can
[56:12] do to throw him off his plan and so if
[56:14] his plan includes you there's nothing no
[56:16] height nor death nor peril nor sword nor
[56:19] famine there's neither there's nothing
[56:21] that can separate you from the love of
[56:24] god that is in christ jesus that's
[56:27] shouting grounds that's glory to us
[56:28] today
[56:31] but that's what he did what about us
[56:34] what does what does his his worthy life
[56:38] does that speak to you
[56:41] now think about it from young to old
[56:44] today
[56:46] what does it does it say anything to you
[56:48] that that he lived a worthy life and
[56:51] that he surrendered everything even to
[56:53] the point of death don't treat him like
[56:56] santa claus
[56:58] see that's not what he is he's to be
[57:00] your savior he's to be a redeemer he's
[57:03] the one you owe everything to
[57:06] hallelujah
[57:10] to live this plan before stars were
[57:14] created he had a plan
[57:16] to live in his church
[57:18] to bring her back
[57:20] to a sabbath that she fell from that's
[57:23] why we're here today that's what calvary
[57:25] made possible to take us back to our
[57:28] sabbath
[57:29] to take us back to our rest
[57:32] through the fall of the first adam sadly
[57:36] the exact same cycle of failure we find
[57:40] in the church history and the history of
[57:42] the jews in the old testament the
[57:44] history of the church down through the
[57:46] ages
[57:47] we find very sadly the exact same cycle
[57:50] of failure would repeat
[57:52] in the restored eve of the early church
[57:55] because as adam
[57:57] fell
[57:58] and christ was the second adam to
[58:00] because that had to be accomplished
[58:02] first adam failed to do it the second
[58:04] adam was not going to fail
[58:06] but then it also had to be a restoration
[58:09] of the eve because he was determined to
[58:11] have a family he was determined to have
[58:13] a bride he's determined to have a
[58:15] kingdom
[58:16] amen and so she would have to be
[58:18] restored as well
[58:20] and just like the eve of
[58:23] genesis the eve at nicea fell also in
[58:27] the early ages
[58:29] how did she fall by accepting a
[58:32] watered-down version of christ
[58:35] christ is the word
[58:37] now not the historical figure everybody
[58:39] believes he's the son of god everybody
[58:40] that's here today believes he was the
[58:41] son of god everybody believes he rose
[58:43] from the dead everybody believes he died
[58:46] for my sins we we
[58:48] we talk about that that's that's almost
[58:50] like a little card they can hand you all
[58:52] you got to do is say i believe in jesus
[58:54] christ son of god died for my sins well
[58:55] you're going to heaven i'm sorry it's
[58:57] not that simple
[59:00] there's more to it than that his death
[59:02] meant more than what you can put on a
[59:04] little card
[59:06] his death meant more i'm here to tell
[59:07] you this gospel is dripping in blood
[59:10] and it's not a cheap gospel and we must
[59:13] never surrender it to that imagery that
[59:15] it's just some tradition of man it's
[59:17] more than that
[59:23] they fell by accepting a watered-down
[59:25] version now now listen friends because
[59:28] today is a pointless exercise for you if
[59:30] you don't see yourself in these imagery
[59:34] i'm going back to the genesis i'm
[59:35] talking about adam and eve i'm coming to
[59:36] that day on calvary i'm going to the
[59:38] early church i'm talking about israel
[59:41] talking about us i'm talking about the
[59:42] modern day if you don't see yourself
[59:44] woven in there and you don't catch the
[59:46] application of what it means to you then
[59:49] to you today will just be a time you got
[59:51] to dress up and look pretty
[59:53] come to the house of god eat some free
[59:55] food and play some games and go home
[1:00:01] so what did they do
[1:00:03] this is what eve did in the garden this
[1:00:05] is what israel did to to god this is
[1:00:07] what the early church did to christ
[1:00:11] they accepted a watered-down version of
[1:00:14] the word
[1:00:15] of christ which saint paul
[1:00:18] called another jesus
[1:00:21] another jesus people say i want jesus i
[1:00:24] say which one you want oh there's only
[1:00:26] one not according to saint paul
[1:00:28] that he his fear was there you'd worship
[1:00:31] another jesus that he didn't tell you
[1:00:33] about
[1:00:34] and what would it be
[1:00:36] it would be it would be a watered-down
[1:00:38] version it's not the one that paul
[1:00:40] preached this is the battle
[1:00:43] god's family has had to fend off
[1:00:45] constantly especially in the modern age
[1:00:48] say why the modern age because satan's
[1:00:50] eaten
[1:00:52] here or though you're the generation
[1:00:53] upon whom the ends of the world have
[1:00:54] come satan's now had six thousand years
[1:00:56] to perfect his eden and you're living
[1:00:58] right in it right in his zenith
[1:01:00] see
[1:01:01] so more than any other age this is a
[1:01:04] battle
[1:01:06] god's family has to constantly fend off
[1:01:08] a battle
[1:01:09] that some of god's family aren't winning
[1:01:16] some of god's family aren't winning
[1:01:19] i tell you a servant of the lord i see
[1:01:20] too much of god's family who i believe
[1:01:22] to be god's family not winning
[1:01:25] not winning this battle
[1:01:27] allowing satan to somehow water down the
[1:01:30] the effect of the word in your life see
[1:01:33] minimizing
[1:01:34] and minimalizing if we would say the
[1:01:37] word
[1:01:38] as it was delivered and thus hindering
[1:01:41] its effectiveness in their homes and
[1:01:43] their families
[1:01:44] hindering its effect on those they love
[1:01:46] most
[1:01:48] now
[1:01:49] this was not unforeseen by the spirit of
[1:01:51] god i'm i'm so glad a remedy was
[1:01:54] promised aren't you
[1:01:56] a further there was a further promise
[1:01:58] there wasn't just a promise about
[1:02:00] calvary there wasn't just merely a
[1:02:03] promise about a life lived perfectly on
[1:02:05] our behalf
[1:02:06] there was more than just he would go and
[1:02:08] die and conquer hell and take the keys
[1:02:11] of death the hell in the grave and there
[1:02:13] was more than that he would have sinned
[1:02:15] that's wonderful that's an integral part
[1:02:17] but he also ascended
[1:02:19] after the resurrection and he also
[1:02:21] descended and came back into the church
[1:02:25] and that's equally as important as any
[1:02:27] part of it there's no there's no part
[1:02:29] that it can be missing god had to have
[1:02:32] all the parts in place
[1:02:37] see
[1:02:38] and so there was a
[1:02:40] there was a prophecy that the church
[1:02:42] would fall away paul feared that it
[1:02:44] would happen john talked about it peter
[1:02:46] talked about it they it was even
[1:02:48] happening in the day the spirit of
[1:02:50] antichrist was already working in the
[1:02:52] church not something of the of the 21st
[1:02:54] century alone it's not just here the
[1:02:56] spirit of antichrist has always been
[1:02:58] working since the early days of the
[1:02:59] church
[1:03:00] that's scripture
[1:03:02] so it was not unforeseen by the spirit
[1:03:04] of god but he did promise
[1:03:07] there was a further promise that god
[1:03:09] would come at the end time and restore a
[1:03:12] bride once more in the last days now
[1:03:15] listen friends if that's not true if
[1:03:17] what i'm saying right now
[1:03:19] because because sometimes you say that
[1:03:21] in circles and people go oh my goodness
[1:03:23] you're making more out of christianity
[1:03:24] than it ever was it's just about jesus
[1:03:26] at calvary and i don't know what you're
[1:03:27] even talking about but well okay then if
[1:03:31] that's not true
[1:03:33] then why do we have north of 30 000
[1:03:37] denominations in independent christian
[1:03:39] movements
[1:03:42] if what i'm saying isn't true
[1:03:44] if it's not true then how did we get to
[1:03:47] to the differences between oneness
[1:03:49] twoness threeness
[1:03:50] baptizing babies baptized for the dead
[1:03:54] baptizing forward baptizing backwards
[1:03:56] submerging sprinkling mostly all done in
[1:03:59] titles with no no distinct name even
[1:04:02] attached to it how did we get if what
[1:04:05] i'm saying isn't true and it's not a
[1:04:07] true reflection of the church and where
[1:04:10] we are and we call it satan's eden then
[1:04:12] how did we get to the acceptance of the
[1:04:14] sodom condition in the world today
[1:04:19] the political the social and the growing
[1:04:22] religious acceptance of what they call
[1:04:25] alternate lifestyles
[1:04:27] there is only one lifestyle
[1:04:30] worth living and that's an eternal
[1:04:32] lifestyle
[1:04:34] the lifestyle of eternal life is the
[1:04:37] only lifestyle that god recognizes it's
[1:04:41] the only lifestyle that will survive the
[1:04:44] destruction it's the only lifestyle that
[1:04:47] will survive the judgment i want his
[1:04:50] lifestyle
[1:04:51] not an alternate version lifestyle
[1:04:56] not even a an alternate christian
[1:04:58] version lifestyle
[1:05:02] how did we get there
[1:05:04] if what i'm saying isn't true
[1:05:07] how did we get this such an acceptance
[1:05:09] at such a global level the canceling
[1:05:11] culture of the nuclear family
[1:05:15] gay marriages performed in churches
[1:05:19] by clergy

[1:05:43] you know to be to be able to restore it
[1:05:45] to
[1:05:46] we we first need to look at where it was
[1:05:49] lost from
[1:05:51] all right
[1:05:52] so because because this time when he
[1:05:55] restores it
[1:05:57] it's going to be for all time hallelujah
[1:06:00] never to fall again predestinated never
[1:06:02] to fall again
[1:06:04] this is what the message of the hour is
[1:06:07] accomplishing in men and women around
[1:06:08] the world young people today finding
[1:06:11] strength to overcome the evil one in
[1:06:12] this hour how many know that's true amen
[1:06:15] married couples
[1:06:17] dedicating themselves to a token applied
[1:06:20] home teenagers being filled with the
[1:06:22] holy ghost having overcoming power but
[1:06:25] able to overcome the enemy in his zenith
[1:06:28] in his apex of influence in the world
[1:06:30] and yet there are young people who are
[1:06:32] standing today saying i will not take
[1:06:34] the way of the world i don't want to
[1:06:36] water down tradition i want the
[1:06:38] bare-knuckled gospel of the lord jesus
[1:06:41] christ
[1:06:44] amen this is what the resurrection made
[1:06:48] way for
[1:06:51] this is what made
[1:06:53] the true easter real
[1:06:58] it's getting me back to my sabbath
[1:07:02] it's restoring me from something that
[1:07:05] i fell from
[1:07:06] because of all the way back to genesis
[1:07:09] i'm entering back
[1:07:10] to finish out that greatest of all weeks
[1:07:14] i want the devil to know i am
[1:07:17] entering back to finish that greatest
[1:07:20] week of all weeks
[1:07:23] hallelujah what jesus started we're the
[1:07:25] continuation what is it doing it's
[1:07:27] taking us back to a rest oh not just a
[1:07:30] rest but in glorified bodies that rest
[1:07:33] and glorified minds that rest think
[1:07:35] about what that'll be
[1:07:37] the identity of the bride now here's
[1:07:40] here's why
[1:07:41] what we're saying is so important here's
[1:07:43] exactly why now don't i want you to
[1:07:45] really watch this wording because when
[1:07:48] i'm talking about
[1:07:50] the devil to water down the word in your
[1:07:52] mind
[1:07:53] because if he can do that then it'll
[1:07:55] water down your lifestyle
[1:07:57] and you try to live in both worlds which
[1:07:59] you really can't do
[1:08:01] see it's madness to do that
[1:08:04] that's just enough christianity to drive
[1:08:05] you crazy
[1:08:07] see
[1:08:08] so so so when when we talk about
[1:08:12] not
[1:08:13] you know
[1:08:14] not falling for that
[1:08:16] then then say brother jason how do i
[1:08:19] avoid it
[1:08:21] well now we're going to move into some
[1:08:24] things that it's going to occur to you
[1:08:26] how to avoid it and that's what my whole
[1:08:28] subject is today i want to build out and
[1:08:31] say what was that day about
[1:08:34] how did it get to that day what does it
[1:08:36] mean what had it meant what does it mean
[1:08:38] forward what does it mean that was 2 000
[1:08:42] years ago
[1:08:44] what does it mean to me today
[1:08:47] and so to first understand where it's
[1:08:49] going to we need to understand where it
[1:08:50] fell from
[1:08:52] i want to make this statement the
[1:08:53] identity
[1:08:55] when we and not a statement but i i want
[1:08:57] to say this as a as a sub topic of my
[1:09:00] sermon today
[1:09:01] and call it the identity
[1:09:04] of the bride of christ and this will
[1:09:05] help you uh brother mark let's let's
[1:09:08] open uh the bible presenter and
[1:09:10] and i want to go to revelation and a
[1:09:12] couple of places and a few more places
[1:09:14] so you just be ready there we i want to
[1:09:17] catch uh start with
[1:09:18] revelation let me see where i want to
[1:09:20] start well that's going to back up but
[1:09:22] that's okay we can do it upside down
[1:09:24] like that let's go first to revelation
[1:09:26] 21
[1:09:28] 9.
[1:09:29] now what are we talking about the
[1:09:31] identity the identity of the bride of
[1:09:33] christ
[1:09:34] because and it's not about
[1:09:36] uh
[1:09:38] just
[1:09:39] proving to the world who you are
[1:09:42] you need to prove it to you
[1:09:44] amen you need you need to know
[1:09:47] where you stand otherwise you'll have no
[1:09:49] no strength to fight the devil he'll
[1:09:51] convince you you're nothing and worthy
[1:09:53] of nothing and you'll believe him and
[1:09:54] fall for it and give up and faint
[1:09:57] see so the identity of the bride as i've
[1:10:00] said to you many times when abraham was
[1:10:02] put to that great test and and he's
[1:10:04] ready to bring the brother branham said
[1:10:06] he's determined to bring that knife down
[1:10:08] as much as i am to pick up my bible and
[1:10:10] that's when an angel caught his hand
[1:10:12] abraham abraham touched not the child
[1:10:14] for now i know
[1:10:16] and i just said for years do you suppose
[1:10:18] there was something god didn't know and
[1:10:20] god was like i don't know what's going
[1:10:21] to happen here let me see oh he's going
[1:10:23] to do it stop him whoa
[1:10:25] abraham wow now i really know
[1:10:29] no
[1:10:31] god already knew
[1:10:32] that abraham would believe him when push
[1:10:35] come to shove when it come down to even
[1:10:37] the son the life of his own son abraham
[1:10:39] would still value god's word over his
[1:10:41] own child
[1:10:43] god already knew it but abraham needed
[1:10:46] to know it abraham needed to know i will
[1:10:48] believe god no matter what
[1:10:54] see
[1:10:56] revelation 21 9 now the identity of the
[1:10:58] bride of christ and there came unto me
[1:11:00] one of the seven angels
[1:11:02] which had the seven vows full of the
[1:11:04] seven last plagues and talked with me
[1:11:05] saying come hither
[1:11:07] i will show thee the bride
[1:11:10] the lamb's wife go up two verses or i'm
[1:11:13] sorry to uh chapter 19 mark
[1:11:16] brother mark chapter 19
[1:11:18] verse 7
[1:11:19] let us be glad and rejoice
[1:11:22] and give honor to him
[1:11:24] for the marriage of the lamb is come
[1:11:28] and his wife hath made herself ready so
[1:11:33] so the scriptures in revelation
[1:11:36] speaks about the marriage of the lamb
[1:11:39] which of course is jesus christ our lord
[1:11:41] amen and it's jesus christ our lord and
[1:11:44] his wife
[1:11:46] so that's the first thing you need to
[1:11:47] get that that that he is the lord and he
[1:11:51] has a bride
[1:11:53] and she makes herself ready
[1:11:55] by the provisions that he gives her
[1:11:57] that's how that's exactly how uh esther
[1:12:01] uh was prepared she took the garments
[1:12:04] that were given to her by the messenger
[1:12:06] all the other girls chose their own way
[1:12:10] they all chose their own liking and the
[1:12:12] things they wanted to present to the
[1:12:14] king the way they wanted to look esther
[1:12:16] wanted nothing to do with her own
[1:12:18] ideology there was a messenger there and
[1:12:21] she said whatever you give me that's
[1:12:23] what i'll take and i won't take anything
[1:12:25] else and that messenger dressed her in
[1:12:27] the garments of god's word and she has
[1:12:30] made herself ready
[1:12:33] by being willing
[1:12:37] to forsake her own way
[1:12:40] see
[1:12:42] so we find then that the bible is a book
[1:12:45] of marriage you can take that down for
[1:12:47] the mark just stand by for any others i
[1:12:48] might want to get to
[1:12:50] so the bible then i don't know if you've
[1:12:52] ever thought about it like that
[1:12:54] the bible is a book of marriage
[1:12:57] see
[1:12:59] and so
[1:13:00] his death and his burial
[1:13:03] and his glorious resurrection at calvary
[1:13:07] was the necessary the very
[1:13:10] necessary preparation preparation for a
[1:13:13] bride first of all
[1:13:15] to take his name
[1:13:17] in marriage preparation a very necessary
[1:13:21] his death burial his life lived his
[1:13:23] willing sacrifice his death and burial
[1:13:26] his resurrection these were necessary
[1:13:29] preparation for her to become the lamb's
[1:13:32] wife for all the eternal ages to come
[1:13:38] world without end amen
[1:13:43] the character of god
[1:13:45] had to be restored
[1:13:48] to the earth
[1:13:49] in human form
[1:13:51] that's why jesus came part of why he
[1:13:53] came
[1:13:54] remember that i've showed you how that
[1:13:56] he was our total satisfaction it wasn't
[1:13:58] just our atonement
[1:13:59] he was a total satisfaction he was not
[1:14:02] only did he pay
[1:14:04] the price that you couldn't pay but he
[1:14:06] also lived the perceptive side of the
[1:14:08] word on your behalf which you can't do
[1:14:10] and fail at constantly see
[1:14:13] and so
[1:14:14] so we find that he he lived that
[1:14:16] perceptive side and he gave his life a
[1:14:19] ransom for many and so we find then that
[1:14:23] this character of god because it had
[1:14:25] been lost that that perfect character
[1:14:28] had been lost in the first adam and you
[1:14:31] know god had been able to show it
[1:14:33] through various prophets through noah
[1:14:35] through enoch you know through abraham
[1:14:38] through moses but everywhere along the
[1:14:40] way somebody had a little in their
[1:14:42] armor
[1:14:44] even joseph had a little in his
[1:14:46] armor it didn't matter who they were
[1:14:48] they there there's and i love that quote
[1:14:50] brother matt read here recently how that
[1:14:53] you know that when satan came to calvary
[1:14:56] and he you know jumped on jesus to sink
[1:14:58] his stinger of death at him said he hit
[1:15:00] a 5 000 vote
[1:15:03] said he learned this what moses
[1:15:07] this ain't moses son this is this is
[1:15:09] somebody more than moses you got moses
[1:15:12] to lose his cool and strike the rock
[1:15:14] twice breaking the type you got abraham
[1:15:17] to tell a bunch of lies and backslide
[1:15:18] leave the promised land you got you even
[1:15:21] got joseph to try to get his daddy to
[1:15:23] tell a lie to pharaoh but but when your
[1:15:25] brother said when he hit this one he
[1:15:27] said it was 5 000 volts and it singed
[1:15:30] his wings
[1:15:31] he jumped back said my goodness this is
[1:15:33] something more than i've ever
[1:15:34] encountered in 4 000 years
[1:15:39] oh my if you'd have thought about that
[1:15:40] he wouldn't have been partying
[1:15:42] in hell when
[1:15:44] knock came on the door he'd have been
[1:15:45] barricading
[1:15:48] he's coming
[1:15:53] oh my
[1:15:55] he's going to get just as surprised that
[1:15:56] you're going
[1:15:59] just as shocked as he was at his coming
[1:16:00] he's going to be just as shocked that
[1:16:02] you're going
[1:16:03] he's going to get up one of these days
[1:16:05] okay i'm gonna get my get my plan out
[1:16:08] okay where's he at where where where'd
[1:16:10] he go anybody seen him no in fact he's
[1:16:12] ain't seeing any of them we talking
[1:16:13] about they're all gone you mean all my
[1:16:15] plans are now worthless yep
[1:16:17] they're all worthless that that family
[1:16:20] has returned to the sabbath
[1:16:23] hallelujah
[1:16:26] see and so the character of god had to
[1:16:28] be restored in human form so it could
[1:16:30] then be shared
[1:16:32] with his coming church he had to be a
[1:16:35] perfect life the most perfect life ever
[1:16:37] lived there had to be a life
[1:16:40] listen
[1:16:41] you want to appreciate jesus
[1:16:44] there had to be a life lived
[1:16:47] that once and for all time
[1:16:50] lived by every
[1:16:53] word of god
[1:16:56] friends this is the beauty of the holy
[1:16:58] ghost see
[1:16:59] it was that perfect life sacrificed that
[1:17:03] re that made way to restore us back to
[1:17:06] fellowship with god sincerity listen
[1:17:09] listen sincerity alone
[1:17:12] while appreciated by god and it's not
[1:17:15] without value
[1:17:17] all right
[1:17:18] it's not without value
[1:17:20] sincerity alone is not without value but
[1:17:23] without
[1:17:25] the spiritual new birth then
[1:17:27] christianity we find too often is rarely
[1:17:31] more than practiced tradition
[1:17:34] see
[1:17:36] when you go back to look at the model
[1:17:38] let's go back to eve before she fell
[1:17:41] before she fell eve operated as mrs adam
[1:17:46] see
[1:17:48] see just like we're mrs jesus christ
[1:17:50] amen so the resurrection proved that he
[1:17:54] was the second adam his sacrifice then
[1:17:57] his death and resurrection uh continued
[1:18:01] his plan from genesis when he gave him
[1:18:04] bloody sheepskins remember that that was
[1:18:06] the start of it that was the first sign
[1:18:08] that's where brother branham says he's
[1:18:10] god and he won't be defeated he wasn't
[1:18:12] content to see his creation lay there
[1:18:14] and ruin because he's god and he won't
[1:18:16] be defeated and so he stood him up and
[1:18:19] and he said take those those man-made
[1:18:22] vines and leaves that won't cover you i
[1:18:25] can still see your nakedness through
[1:18:27] that the only thing that'll cover your
[1:18:29] nakedness is blood
[1:18:31] the only thing that'll that'll cover you
[1:18:33] you're you're being exposed to this as
[1:18:36] the sinner you are is bloody skins
[1:18:39] and so he clothed him in that
[1:18:43] see god can see through the hypocrisy
[1:18:46] of fig leaves
[1:18:48] a fig leaf religion you're not covered
[1:18:50] at all
[1:18:52] god sees you're still a sinner
[1:18:54] see you see he he has mercy on you he
[1:18:57] loves you it's not i mean if he didn't
[1:18:59] none of us would have stood a chance but
[1:19:01] he's wanting you to surrender those fig
[1:19:03] leaves quit trying to dress yourself up
[1:19:05] like a christian and be a christian
[1:19:07] get born again of the spirit of god see
[1:19:13] so you know
[1:19:15] one of the things that should be noted
[1:19:16] is that she was already called adam
[1:19:20] before she was ever even expressed in
[1:19:22] flesh before eve
[1:19:24] before you know the before the fall
[1:19:28] eve's authority
[1:19:30] in the garden
[1:19:32] was in her husband's name as mrs adam
[1:19:36] see
[1:19:37] and so so it's just like the child of
[1:19:40] god in prayer to god
[1:19:43] see that if eve didn't like the
[1:19:46] direction of the wind or it chilled her
[1:19:48] she would say to adam dear it's cold out
[1:19:51] the wind and he would say peace
[1:19:54] be still
[1:19:55] you see the model now there you are
[1:19:57] today that's your prayer that's your
[1:19:58] intercessory to god
[1:20:00] you know something friends i it's a
[1:20:03] it's it's a reality of the bible
[1:20:05] that that if you don't
[1:20:08] if you don't have
[1:20:10] a
[1:20:11] a
[1:20:12] deep
[1:20:14] passionate
[1:20:15] love affair relationship with your
[1:20:18] spouse
[1:20:19] then you sure don't understand anything
[1:20:21] about prayer
[1:20:22] you definitely don't know how to pray
[1:20:25] because that's what prayer is
[1:20:27] that they're that they're the exact same
[1:20:29] thing
[1:20:30] of the relationship between a husband
[1:20:32] and a wife and that fellowship and that
[1:20:33] kindred hearts
[1:20:35] that's what prayer i mean you can't
[1:20:37] the disciples walked with jesus you
[1:20:40] can't do that he's in heaven you're in
[1:20:42] the earth
[1:20:43] you can't walk go up there and see him
[1:20:44] so how how do you how do you expect to
[1:20:47] have fellowship with him if you're
[1:20:48] catholic you'll come here on mass and
[1:20:51] we'll turn bread into his body and you
[1:20:53] can at least eat it
[1:20:56] see which is nonsense and and and they
[1:21:00] say that's the body of christ it's not
[1:21:01] the body of christ so how do you know
[1:21:03] because i'm the body of christ
[1:21:06] amen and so how do you expect to get in
[1:21:09] contact with the blood how do you expect
[1:21:11] to get in contact with god through
[1:21:13] prayer
[1:21:15] that's why paul said marriage is this
[1:21:17] way it's just a model of marriage this
[1:21:19] way it's really he said i'm really
[1:21:21] talking about christ and his church
[1:21:24] see
[1:21:27] and so people who don't understand how
[1:21:29] to contact god no wonder they make
[1:21:31] horrible spouses
[1:21:33] because they've never figured out that
[1:21:35] fellowship with the spirit of god
[1:21:39] i'll tell you young sisters don't ever
[1:21:40] marry a man who don't know how to pray
[1:21:43] he won't treat you right if he if he
[1:21:44] doesn't know how to pray
[1:21:46] hey man brothers don't you dare i don't
[1:21:48] care how pretty she is and bats those
[1:21:49] eyes if she don't have a relationship
[1:21:51] with christ you run
[1:21:54] run as fast as you can
[1:21:57] see
[1:21:59] because the the bible is a book of
[1:22:01] marriage
[1:22:03] our authority just like her authority in
[1:22:06] the
[1:22:07] in the garden of of of eden
[1:22:09] her authority was in the name of her
[1:22:11] husband as mrs adam our authority is in
[1:22:15] the name of the second adam jesus christ
[1:22:18] amen that's why our authority and i'm
[1:22:20] here to tell you there's power in his
[1:22:21] name
[1:22:23] there's healing in his name there's
[1:22:24] deliverance in his name there's
[1:22:26] salvation in no other name
[1:22:28] hallelujah
[1:22:31] only in his name alone
[1:22:34] so the bible being a book of marriage it
[1:22:36] tells us
[1:22:38] of
[1:22:39] adam and his bride eve
[1:22:43] jehovah
[1:22:44] and his bride the old testament israel
[1:22:47] christ and his new testament church i
[1:22:50] mean the bible is is filled with all of
[1:22:53] these stories about this marriage it's a
[1:22:55] book of marriage
[1:22:56] it tells about the king and the queen
[1:22:59] living in a millennium it tells about
[1:23:01] the spirit and the bride speaking in one
[1:23:04] voice not a divided voice
[1:23:08] not a divided voice
[1:23:10] the bride doesn't have a divided voice
[1:23:12] from the spirit
[1:23:13] she has thus saith the lord she doesn't
[1:23:15] say anything
[1:23:16] now now don't don't think of that as
[1:23:18] meaning that she just sits with her
[1:23:20] mouth closed until she until an unction
[1:23:22] comes on her that's that's that's not
[1:23:25] that's a very narrow view of that what
[1:23:28] it means is is that she only speaks thus
[1:23:31] saith the lord
[1:23:32] so her life is a because that's your
[1:23:35] voice
[1:23:36] is your life that's why the bible calls
[1:23:38] it your chaste conversation
[1:23:41] amen
[1:23:42] it's not talking about what you do when
[1:23:43] you go down to the market and talk to
[1:23:44] people about jesus
[1:23:46] it wouldn't wouldn't do you a bit of
[1:23:47] good except make you a hypocrite and
[1:23:50] then and get yourself laughed at if you
[1:23:52] talk about jesus here but there's you
[1:23:55] don't talk about jesus here
[1:23:58] and there's no jesus there's no voice of
[1:24:00] the resurrection in your life
[1:24:03] that's why it's a shout and a voice and
[1:24:04] a trumpet god doesn't need me to go back
[1:24:07] and do the shout that's already been
[1:24:08] accomplished by elijah my stage is now
[1:24:11] the voice to be the voice of a live life
[1:24:13] and i'm here to tell you the spirit and
[1:24:15] the bride speak in the same voice
[1:24:18] see
[1:24:19] oh my
[1:24:20] it's not a divided voice not christ
[1:24:23] living one version of the word
[1:24:26] and the true church living a different
[1:24:29] life
[1:24:30] can i say that again
[1:24:32] it's not christ living one version of
[1:24:34] the word
[1:24:35] and then his family
[1:24:38] living a different version of the word
[1:24:41] genesis
[1:24:43] is a book of seeds it's the seed chapter
[1:24:45] the book of beginnings it's the
[1:24:47] literally the origin of all things as we
[1:24:48] are at least given to understand as
[1:24:51] mortals
[1:24:53] so for us to identify
[1:24:55] the bride of jesus christ
[1:24:58] the and the second adam
[1:25:02] we've got to go back to the first adam
[1:25:04] right brother mark first corinthians
[1:25:05] chapter 15 one short verse first
[1:25:08] corinthians 15 45.
[1:25:10] the first man adam was made a living
[1:25:14] soul
[1:25:15] the last adam was made a quickening
[1:25:18] spirit see so now
[1:25:20] you've got a genesis adam and you've got
[1:25:23] a second adam that fell on the day of
[1:25:25] pentecost
[1:25:26] amen you've got that second adam now
[1:25:29] coming into you making you second eve
[1:25:32] makes sense see
[1:25:33] so the first man adam was made a living
[1:25:35] soul the last adam was made a quickening
[1:25:38] spirit because it had to be that because
[1:25:41] god was never going to be content to
[1:25:43] walk around in in the body of one man
[1:25:46] walking the shores of galilee going
[1:25:47] about doing good jesus was never going
[1:25:50] to stay in that they actually wanted to
[1:25:53] make him a king and he ran from them
[1:25:55] see
[1:25:56] that's a lesson for us see
[1:25:59] we we want to let god make us what he
[1:26:01] wants us to be
[1:26:02] and so so so we realized then that that
[1:26:06] now he comes in to his bride as a
[1:26:08] quickening spirit see and so so what
[1:26:11] happened at the beginning from genesis
[1:26:13] then quite naturally holds the answer of
[1:26:17] how the bride will be
[1:26:19] reconnected to him if you want to know
[1:26:22] if you're if you're separated from him
[1:26:24] today and you want easter
[1:26:27] to be more
[1:26:28] than just a tradition
[1:26:31] then you're going to have to know how
[1:26:33] the bride gets reconnected back to him
[1:26:35] and just as importantly and let me say
[1:26:37] this just as importantly how the bride
[1:26:40] is identified in the earth as his body
[1:26:45] mankind walking in a very dark world
[1:26:48] would you agree
[1:26:50] and the darkness of his fallen birth
[1:26:52] he's to find light through you
[1:26:55] he's to find light through the bride
[1:26:58] that's the that's the whole purpose of
[1:27:00] the holy ghost coming into the church
[1:27:03] and because now you're the light see as
[1:27:06] he was a light but he wasn't never going
[1:27:08] to stay in one body he they he said if
[1:27:11] unless this corner of wheat died abides
[1:27:13] alone that was never his plan
[1:27:15] his plan was to live in a many-membered
[1:27:17] family and you be his body therefore the
[1:27:20] the the life is the light of the world
[1:27:24] just as his life was light of the world
[1:27:25] if that same jesus lives in you that
[1:27:28] makes you the light of the world see
[1:27:31] as mrs jesus christ
[1:27:33] and so mankind walking in this dark
[1:27:35] world and walking in his darkened uh
[1:27:37] condition of
[1:27:38] of a fallen condition he's going to have
[1:27:40] to find the light and it's the bride
[1:27:42] manifesting the light that leads them
[1:27:46] back to him
[1:27:49] your life isn't about
[1:27:52] living your own life and and and you've
[1:27:55] kind of got god like an ace up your
[1:27:57] sleeve to help you
[1:27:59] figure out to go in your life the way
[1:28:01] you want to live that's not what life is
[1:28:02] even about it was never about that
[1:28:05] your life is here to be a replication of
[1:28:08] the life of god in the earth to a dying
[1:28:11] world because listen friends this life
[1:28:13] don't matter
[1:28:15] this life's not about this when it's
[1:28:16] just training for the next one
[1:28:21] see
[1:28:23] so a main premise then
[1:28:26] if not the
[1:28:27] if not the main premise was that the
[1:28:29] first woman
[1:28:31] was made
[1:28:33] for
[1:28:34] adam now that is a massive point you're
[1:28:37] going to understand why in a few minutes
[1:28:39] first corinthians 11 brother mark
[1:28:43] first corinthians 11 8 and 9
[1:28:47] for the man
[1:28:49] is not of
[1:28:51] the woman
[1:28:52] but the woman
[1:28:54] of the man neither was the man created
[1:28:59] for the woman
[1:29:00] but the woman for the man
[1:29:04] so there's no part of the plan of
[1:29:06] redemption
[1:29:09] i got you
[1:29:10] i got you
[1:29:12] so there's no part
[1:29:14] of the plan of redemption
[1:29:16] for you as his bride
[1:29:19] to go your own way
[1:29:22] live your own life
[1:29:24] chase your own dreams
[1:29:27] accomplish what you want to accomplish
[1:29:30] there's nowhere in there's nowhere in
[1:29:32] creation
[1:29:34] that was never god's intention
[1:29:36] the the woman the man wasn't made for
[1:29:39] the woman the woman was made for the man
[1:29:42] so so so we find out then that there's
[1:29:45] no part in this plan of redemption that
[1:29:47] has you going your own way deciding for
[1:29:50] your own self
[1:29:52] what's right
[1:29:53] and what's wrong i'm here to tell you
[1:29:56] it's not given to you to do that
[1:29:59] it's not granted to you to do that
[1:30:02] say well you know
[1:30:04] let a man work out his own salvation and
[1:30:05] fear and trembling brother branham said
[1:30:07] that's until you get the holy ghost
[1:30:11] that's only until you get the holy ghost
[1:30:13] once you get the holy ghost it's let
[1:30:14] this mind be in you which was in christ
[1:30:17] jesus
[1:30:18] see they did that in the old testament
[1:30:20] every man did what seems right in his
[1:30:21] own eyes that was fine until god called
[1:30:23] abraham
[1:30:25] you see i mean so so that that wasn't
[1:30:27] going to work anymore so so we find then
[1:30:30] that
[1:30:31] that because the man is not of the woman
[1:30:34] but the woman of the man neither was the
[1:30:36] man created for the woman but the woman
[1:30:39] for the man so so your life itself was
[1:30:43] brought forth for his glory to take your
[1:30:48] part
[1:30:49] in his plan
[1:30:52] now if you don't want to be his bride
[1:30:54] okay
[1:30:57] okay
[1:30:58] then go live your life
[1:31:01] eat drink and be merry god be merciful
[1:31:03] to you somehow some way find a way
[1:31:07] but what i'm trying to get you to
[1:31:08] understand is you can't live in both
[1:31:10] worlds
[1:31:12] not on purpose
[1:31:14] i know we stumble in and out of both
[1:31:16] worlds i get that i stumble in and out
[1:31:18] of both worlds thank god that we have
[1:31:21] repentance
[1:31:22] and if we repent he's faithful and just
[1:31:24] to forgive us but you can't live that
[1:31:26] way on purpose
[1:31:30] you need the holy ghost because there's
[1:31:32] no no part of redemption that is
[1:31:35] designed to accommodate that
[1:31:38] you're either born again of the spirit
[1:31:40] of god and going by the mind of christ
[1:31:42] or you're not and you're going your own
[1:31:44] way you might be a pretty good person
[1:31:45] and got a pretty good way forward in
[1:31:47] front of you i just say okay go ahead
[1:31:49] good luck with that
[1:31:51] okay
[1:31:52] that's the choice you make that ain't
[1:31:53] choice i make
[1:31:55] as i've said to you i can't imagine
[1:31:57] somebody meeting jesus and wanting to
[1:31:59] stay themselves
[1:32:01] when i met christ i didn't want to be me
[1:32:03] anymore at all
[1:32:05] not at all
[1:32:07] see
[1:32:10] for those who are willing to surrender
[1:32:12] their life
[1:32:14] and take on his nature
[1:32:18] this might not be for everybody but for
[1:32:20] those who are willing
[1:32:23] to surrender their life
[1:32:25] and take on his nature
[1:32:28] take on his life
[1:32:30] take on his dreams
[1:32:32] can i say it you're here for easter take
[1:32:35] on his cross
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:32:40] say oh i was doing good to you said that
[1:32:42] well let me just tell you for those who
[1:32:44] are willing to take his life in his
[1:32:46] dreams for those who are willing to take
[1:32:48] on his cross i have not seen nor ear
[1:32:51] heard neither have it in the heart of
[1:32:53] man the thing which god hath prepared
[1:32:57] for them that love him
[1:33:00] that's easter to me friends that's why
[1:33:03] i'm here today
[1:33:05] oh my eve was not made from outside
[1:33:08] material
[1:33:10] listen what i'm i'm now what am i doing
[1:33:13] i'm proving to you you can't live in
[1:33:15] both worlds
[1:33:16] i'm proving to you there's no middle
[1:33:18] ground like that in redemption
[1:33:21] and i'm proving it to you by going back
[1:33:23] to genesis the seed chapter
[1:33:26] see
[1:33:29] so eve when we go back and look at
[1:33:31] genesis we find out that eve was not
[1:33:32] made from outside material that is she
[1:33:34] wasn't made from another piece of clay
[1:33:37] or dust she was made from adam's
[1:33:40] existing material
[1:33:44] the self-same material literally not
[1:33:47] figuratively
[1:33:49] literally the self-same material is
[1:33:51] adam's body
[1:33:53] god took from man to make the woman
[1:33:58] you know there's gonna be some people on
[1:34:00] youtube watch this and go man that guy's
[1:34:02] doing nothing but just preaching a
[1:34:03] political he's on a political stump he's
[1:34:05] just doing we're going to cancel culture
[1:34:07] him because you know he's a misogynist
[1:34:09] i'm not a misogynist at all i i wish the
[1:34:12] whole i wish every woman would see the
[1:34:14] position the word gives her
[1:34:16] it's one of the most glorious things she
[1:34:18] was first in line to meet a prophet
[1:34:19] beyond the curtain of time if she over
[1:34:21] if she keeps her virtue she'll stand
[1:34:23] there as a greater trophy than any man
[1:34:26] ever did
[1:34:27] because she's a weaker vessel and pulled
[1:34:28] it off anyway
[1:34:31] oh let me encourage you sisters pull it
[1:34:33] off anyway
[1:34:34] in spite of the devil in spite of
[1:34:36] hollywood in spite of the world be a
[1:34:38] christian be a real daughter of the
[1:34:40] kingdom of god
[1:34:43] hallelujah
[1:34:45] see
[1:34:46] i'm proving to you there's no there's no
[1:34:48] way for her to have her own will she
[1:34:50] wasn't even made out of her own virgin
[1:34:52] material
[1:34:54] she she was made off of something see
[1:34:58] and so she was not made she she she
[1:35:01] literally is the self-same material as
[1:35:03] adam's body god took uh from man to make
[1:35:06] the woman and adam identified her and
[1:35:09] said you are now bone of my bone and
[1:35:11] flesh of my flesh therefore her identity
[1:35:16] was in adam
[1:35:18] she was literally one with
[1:35:22] adam see
[1:35:24] now
[1:35:25] in genesis
[1:35:26] there's a separation
[1:35:29] she was and he shall call their name
[1:35:32] adam this before they're in flesh
[1:35:34] and it was only after they come in flesh
[1:35:37] and now god separates so genesis has a
[1:35:41] separation
[1:35:42] where god was separating eve from adam
[1:35:46] well today my precious friends easter is
[1:35:49] all about a bringing of them back
[1:35:51] together again we're on our journey back
[1:35:55] into god back into god back into god
[1:35:59] we're on our journey
[1:36:01] we're being joined back into god
[1:36:05] see
[1:36:07] so brother branham would say it like
[1:36:08] this and i didn't put it on the
[1:36:09] powerpoint i just wanted to read it
[1:36:10] myself it's short from the invisible
[1:36:13] union i love that title
[1:36:16] world doesn't see it why because it's
[1:36:17] invisible
[1:36:19] you don't see it unless you're on the
[1:36:20] inside
[1:36:22] the invisible union of the bride of
[1:36:25] christ
[1:36:26] there will come forth a resurrection day
[1:36:29] you believe it
[1:36:30] which the first will be last and they
[1:36:32] which are last will be first the old
[1:36:33] prophets will come breaking forth
[1:36:36] first
[1:36:37] and they see that procession going
[1:36:39] marching up in the air
[1:36:41] and we which are alive and remain shall
[1:36:43] not hinder them which are asleep for the
[1:36:45] trumpet of god shall sound the dead and
[1:36:47] christ shall rise first
[1:36:49] we'll fall right in line
[1:36:51] with them going in hallelujah all the
[1:36:54] way down through the age of luther
[1:36:56] wesley methodist criteria all the way
[1:36:58] down to the last age who received the
[1:37:00] word in their age i'm here to tell you
[1:37:02] something friends on that morning you're
[1:37:04] going to see something the world ain't
[1:37:05] going to see you're going to see a
[1:37:07] procession headed up and you're going to
[1:37:09] stand there waiting oh here comes luther
[1:37:11] here comes wesley here comes azusa here
[1:37:13] comes here comes the early fathers okay
[1:37:15] here's my place marching to zion oh what
[1:37:18] a morning that's gonna be
[1:37:21] hallelujah
[1:37:23] so god removed a part of adam formed a
[1:37:26] woman and then brought her and
[1:37:28] introduced her back to adam so she was
[1:37:30] at him in female form
[1:37:33] that makes sense to you so she she can i
[1:37:35] say it like this
[1:37:37] she was the bride coming of adam
[1:37:41] see
[1:37:42] now let's look at revelation 1 13. we've
[1:37:45] done this before i'm just going to look
[1:37:46] at two verses revelation 1 13 and in the
[1:37:49] midst of the seven candlesticks was one
[1:37:52] like the son of man
[1:37:53] clothed with the garment down to the
[1:37:55] foot and gird about the paps with a
[1:37:57] golden girdle now there's no question
[1:37:59] who this is it's the son of man it's
[1:38:01] it's one like the son of man it's jesus
[1:38:03] walking in the midst of his seven lamp
[1:38:05] stands that's the bible imagery but
[1:38:07] notice he's gird about the pabst which
[1:38:09] is the breast and that's a that's a
[1:38:11] female designation and brother branham
[1:38:12] said see it's one like the son of man
[1:38:16] it's the bride
[1:38:17] say but i thought it was jesus it is
[1:38:20] but well then how is it the bride right
[1:38:24] but it's jesus uh-huh
[1:38:26] well then you said it to pride you got
[1:38:28] it
[1:38:30] she is him
[1:38:31] he's in her
[1:38:33] she's mrs adam she's bone of his bone
[1:38:36] flesh of his flesh the bible imagery is
[1:38:39] showing what the holy ghost made
[1:38:40] possible
[1:38:43] now that's how she was at the beginning
[1:38:45] of the age but then if you read the
[1:38:48] church ages you find a sad story of
[1:38:51] failure
[1:38:53] you find a sad story of of of keeping
[1:38:56] the doctrines of the nicolaitans and
[1:38:58] thou suffers that woman to jezebel who i
[1:39:00] hate and and you how you're living in
[1:39:02] the place where satan's seed is and
[1:39:04] you've left your first love and all of
[1:39:06] these various things we find a very sad
[1:39:09] story but when you come to revelation 10
[1:39:12] 1 under the restoration give me 10 1
[1:39:14] brother mark and i saw another mighty
[1:39:17] angel come down from heaven clothed with
[1:39:19] a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:39:21] and his face was as it were the sun and
[1:39:24] his feet as pillars of fire i'm not
[1:39:26] preaching on it today but every one of
[1:39:28] these bible imagery is christ in his
[1:39:31] bride and that's why brother branham
[1:39:33] would call it the bride coming of christ
[1:39:37] see i thought it was the mighty angel
[1:39:39] it's christ it is united with her in an
[1:39:42] invisible union and she is him
[1:39:47] and that's why the world can't accept us
[1:39:49] because they don't accept him
[1:39:56] so in our day we are promised the
[1:39:58] restoration of this bible imagery see
[1:40:02] no wonder
[1:40:05] no wonder on this easter morning i'm
[1:40:07] coming to a close
[1:40:09] no wonder on this easter morning
[1:40:13] when maybe you
[1:40:15] thought you would come here and hear
[1:40:16] about pink bunnies and
[1:40:18] pretty flowers
[1:40:21] and you would get just a nice little
[1:40:23] traditional sermonette
[1:40:25] and then we could all go have tea
[1:40:29] instead you found out that
[1:40:31] this is exactly why because of easter
[1:40:34] is exactly why you can't hold
[1:40:37] hands with the world
[1:40:39] and christ at the same time
[1:40:43] you can't do it you can't appear
[1:40:46] in the world
[1:40:48] looking like the world
[1:40:50] and project the image of the word at the
[1:40:54] same time
[1:40:57] easter
[1:40:58] rules that out
[1:41:01] say wow i never thought about easter
[1:41:03] like that good think about it like that
[1:41:05] today
[1:41:06] easter rules that out
[1:41:08] because of the death burial and
[1:41:10] resurrection you say oh he did it all i
[1:41:12] don't have to do anything wrong
[1:41:15] the whole reason there was a lived life
[1:41:17] of death burial and resurrection was so
[1:41:18] he could come in you and continue his
[1:41:20] plan
[1:41:22] that's the whole plan of redemption
[1:41:24] you don't get to pick and choose you
[1:41:26] don't get to water it down you don't get
[1:41:28] to live a halfway life not in be a
[1:41:30] christian
[1:41:31] not and be full of the spirit of god
[1:41:33] there's no place listen friends there's
[1:41:35] no place in revelation 1
[1:41:38] where we just read
[1:41:40] there's no place in the imagery of
[1:41:42] revelation 1 7 or ten one i think it was
[1:41:46] one seven uh 113 i'm sorry there's no
[1:41:48] place in revelation 1 13.
[1:41:51] and there's no place in revelation 10 1
[1:41:54] uh there there's no place in there that
[1:41:57] represents the world
[1:41:59] they all represent christ
[1:42:02] all the imagery of 113 all the imagery
[1:42:04] of 10 1 it all speaks of christ
[1:42:07] go back and read it you don't find the
[1:42:09] imagery of the world in there
[1:42:13] it's inconsistent
[1:42:15] to say i'm the bride of christ but your
[1:42:18] world your life is on purpose lived in
[1:42:21] both worlds
[1:42:24] see
[1:42:28] genesis 5 1 i got 8 minutes
[1:42:31] i made a plan to shut down at 1.
[1:42:34] we'll jump out
[1:42:36] pull parachute it might take me a few
[1:42:38] minutes to drift to the ground but
[1:42:41] this is the book of the generation of
[1:42:42] adam genesis 5 1 this is the book of
[1:42:44] generation of adam
[1:42:46] and the day that god created man and the
[1:42:47] likeness of god made he him
[1:42:50] the likeness of god
[1:42:52] verse 2 genesis 5 2 male and female
[1:42:55] created he them
[1:42:56] and blessed them
[1:42:57] and called their name adam
[1:43:00] in the day
[1:43:01] when they were created
[1:43:04] so adam had dominion and authority over
[1:43:06] the earth as a son of god
[1:43:09] yet
[1:43:11] he was lonely
[1:43:14] see
[1:43:15] and and adam
[1:43:16] you know
[1:43:18] in in and the bible says in genesis 2 18
[1:43:22] and the lord god said
[1:43:24] it is not good that man should be alone
[1:43:28] i will make him a helpmate see
[1:43:31] and so
[1:43:32] it's adam here now say where was that
[1:43:35] loneliness coming from what was this
[1:43:37] longing for
[1:43:40] something to
[1:43:41] contact
[1:43:43] something to fellowship with
[1:43:46] there was he was inside of him
[1:43:49] and as long as she was inside of him
[1:43:51] she was like a pent-up fire
[1:43:54] he couldn't get to it
[1:43:56] it's like a an itch you can't scratch
[1:43:58] it's like the jeremiah said i was not
[1:44:01] going to preach anymore but the word
[1:44:03] burned in me like a fire and i had to
[1:44:05] express it see
[1:44:07] adam had this raging inside of him
[1:44:09] there's something he couldn't he
[1:44:11] couldn't go away from it he couldn't
[1:44:13] walk to the other side of the garden it
[1:44:14] was in him
[1:44:16] he couldn't go to sleep at night or wake
[1:44:18] up the next day he woke he went to sleep
[1:44:20] with it and woke up with it and it
[1:44:22] caused him to want an expression to want
[1:44:24] something more than what he was do you
[1:44:26] understand this was happening because
[1:44:29] adam in such fellowship with god that's
[1:44:31] how god had been in the eternities
[1:44:34] he had you and me pent up inside of him
[1:44:37] and it was a love that had to be
[1:44:39] expressed
[1:44:41] oh this bible is a book of marriage
[1:44:43] friends easter is the greatest marriage
[1:44:46] announcement the world has ever heard
[1:44:49] that's why brother brandon would say
[1:44:50] heaven and earth embraced and kissed one
[1:44:53] another
[1:44:54] oh the question was answered if man die
[1:44:57] can he live again
[1:44:59] yes here's the glorious answer job yes
[1:45:02] he can live again and job said i see it
[1:45:05] i see it and on that day i'll see him in

[1:46:13] with your heads bowed
[1:46:16] your eyes closed
[1:46:18] i want to read you some statements that
[1:46:20] i wrote
[1:46:22] a statement brother branham made
[1:46:26] because i want you to think deeply today
[1:46:29] i i didn't even envision
[1:46:32] this sermon
[1:46:33] dynamically
[1:46:35] i didn't
[1:46:36] i know there's been moments where we get
[1:46:37] so excited it's dynamic and we it's
[1:46:40] delicious we love it we could scream and
[1:46:41] shout and
[1:46:43] jump in the air but
[1:46:45] i want to conclude
[1:46:48] this easter day
[1:46:50] the way he asked me to do it will you do
[1:46:52] that close your eyes bow your heads
[1:46:54] no looking around please honor the holy
[1:46:56] spirit
[1:46:59] i want you to just focus
[1:47:02] on my voice
[1:47:06] i preached this sermon today
[1:47:10] because i want you to know that it's
[1:47:12] more than just calling
[1:47:15] for a temporary resurrection of power
[1:47:17] some band-aid surgery in your life i
[1:47:19] just got a problem i need you to fix no
[1:47:21] it's more than that
[1:47:24] he's not interested in just constantly
[1:47:27] band-aiding your
[1:47:29] symptoms he's trying to
[1:47:32] he's trying to heal you from the inside
[1:47:35] trying to remove the cause
[1:47:39] just the piano please brothers at this
[1:47:41] moment
[1:47:43] so it's more than just calling
[1:47:46] for a temporary resurrection power it's
[1:47:47] more than band-aid surgery this is
[1:47:49] bringing back everything
[1:47:52] i want you to know that what i'm trying
[1:47:53] to instruct you in today
[1:47:56] is bringing back everything because when
[1:47:58] i thought about it for myself
[1:48:00] i said this is going to bring back
[1:48:02] everything i enjoyed
[1:48:04] when i was in his courts
[1:48:07] that's what restoring
[1:48:09] my sabbath
[1:48:11] is all about
[1:48:13] to bring back everything i enjoyed when
[1:48:16] i walked in his courts when i sat by his
[1:48:18] fountains
[1:48:19] say when was that brother jason when
[1:48:21] morning stars gathered for worship
[1:48:24] when all the family of god shouted
[1:48:26] together for joy
[1:48:28] when we were in our right minds
[1:48:32] i want you to know today you're invited
[1:48:34] back to that we have an invitation
[1:48:39] brother adam says in identification
[1:48:41] we're invited
[1:48:42] by god now that should get your
[1:48:44] attention because it's not just brother
[1:48:46] jason inviting you
[1:48:48] we're invited by god
[1:48:51] to take him as an example
[1:48:53] and let our character be molded like his
[1:48:56] what a thing my
[1:48:59] then when we let notice that when we let
[1:49:02] his character be in us
[1:49:06] then we have become sons
[1:49:08] by having the mind of christ
[1:49:11] mind which is his character your mind
[1:49:14] makes your character let the mind paul
[1:49:17] said of christ this mind that was in
[1:49:19] christ be in you let that mind of christ
[1:49:23] be in you
[1:49:25] it molds
[1:49:26] the character of a son of god
[1:49:32] see friends by being obedient to the
[1:49:34] word
[1:49:36] you literally are destroying the things
[1:49:38] that satan has built up against you
[1:49:41] and satan has
[1:49:43] has spent years building up things
[1:49:45] against you but do you realize that by
[1:49:47] taking on the responsibility of that day
[1:49:49] on calvary by being obedient to the word
[1:49:52] that you've heard today you literally
[1:49:54] you literally destroy
[1:49:57] you have the ability today
[1:49:59] to destroy everything he's ever built
[1:50:02] against you
[1:50:03] and jesus christ will give every bit of
[1:50:05] it back to you today
[1:50:08] if you can really get a hold of what
[1:50:10] that day on calvary meant you won't turn
[1:50:12] that down
[1:50:14] i wonder today while heads are bowed and
[1:50:16] eyes are closed

[1:50:21] the cross today his cross

[1:50:26] easter
[1:50:27] really means

[1:50:50] as her lord are you willing
[1:50:53] to have your sabbath

[1:57:47] lord we thank you for your love
[1:57:49] thank you for your word today it's meant
[1:57:51] a lot to me lord
[1:57:54] i thank you for it master i didn't get
[1:57:56] to all my material but i just felt that
[1:57:58] little nudge
[1:57:59] that's quite enough
[1:58:01] i think the message found its place
[1:58:02] today lord
[1:58:04] i think it could be an arrow of
[1:58:05] deliverance i think it was to many
[1:58:08] hearts it found its mark
[1:58:09] that's what the gospel is father it's an
[1:58:12] arrow of deliverance while peter yet
[1:58:14] spake these words
[1:58:15] the holy ghost fell
[1:58:17] lord we didn't we didn't need any any
[1:58:20] outside thing bringing it about just the
[1:58:23] word going forth and being believed and
[1:58:25] the holy spirit anointing it
[1:58:28] has set hearts free
[1:58:30] i know it came to me like that lord
[1:58:32] there was such a revelation there's been
[1:58:34] times in my life lord god
[1:58:36] where the enemy bound me up and held me
[1:58:38] for years over certain things certain
[1:58:41] complexes certain weaknesses this that
[1:58:43] or the other and lord and there were
[1:58:45] times when just hearing your word i was
[1:58:48] free
[1:58:49] in a moment i was free
[1:58:52] it left me in in its place was the light
[1:58:54] of god shining in my heart
[1:58:57] let every young person today take what
[1:58:59] they heard today lord and let it be a
[1:59:00] light to them let it be a guide to their
[1:59:03] footsteps going forward may we
[1:59:06] may we leave here today and this whole
[1:59:07] day this whole special day
[1:59:11] reflect on what easter
[1:59:13] really means
[1:59:15] what it made possible
[1:59:17] that it was one of uh
[1:59:19] of it was one very integral part one
[1:59:22] very necessary part
[1:59:24] the resurrection without that our faith
[1:59:27] is vain
[1:59:28] if christ rose not then our faith is
[1:59:31] vain
[1:59:32] why do we even preach
[1:59:33] but he did raise
[1:59:36] he raised lord god and said all power
[1:59:38] when he ascended into heaven all power
[1:59:41] is given unto me
[1:59:43] that's who our allegiance is to today
[1:59:45] lord
[1:59:46] we renew our allegiance to you today
[1:59:49] young and old alike we thank you for
[1:59:51] this service we commit ourselves into
[1:59:53] your hands
[1:59:54] bless our fellowship today
[1:59:56] lord may you bless the food
[2:00:00] that we're received lord there's many
[2:00:02] people that made it possible
[2:00:04] and
[2:00:05] and and and father so much
[2:00:09] thought and labor has gone into the
[2:00:10] facility and all the hands that made it
[2:00:13] possible may you bless them and bless
[2:00:15] our meal and bless our fellowship we
