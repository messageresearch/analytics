========================================

[Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] um [Music] let's also enter our feet this morning first corinthians chapter 15 if you have your bible we're going to turn there first corinthians chapter 15. amen praise the lord i just want to continue on from where we were a couple sundays ago we spoke on the purge and so we'd like to take this in part two i believe it's a a lengthy subject and so we covered a lot of it last time i'm going to do a just a little bit of refresh on that and then we'll read some quotes some quotations here we'd like to discontinue this first corinthians chapter 15 and i want to begin at verse 12. now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen and if christ be not risen then our preaching is in vain and your faith also vain yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised and if christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins see how important the resurrection is then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable notice he's not saying that if in this life only we had hope but he's actually saying that even if you believe in jesus in this life yet you don't believe in the next life you're still most miserable you follow that even if you're a believer but you don't believe in the resurrection that there's something after this he said i'm of all men most miserable and he says he says here verse 20 but now is christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for since by man came death by man also came the resurrection of the dead foreign for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive but every man and his order christ the firstfruits afterwards they that are christ at his coming then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet you can be seated this morning he must reign verse 25 till he hath put all enemies under his feet so we know that some of those enemies will be put under the feet of christ where he's reigning and where is he reigning at right now in the heart of his children and so he says here he says the last enemy verse 26 that shall be destroyed is death for he hath put all things under his feet but when he said all things are put under him it is manifest that he is accept he is accepted which should put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son of man also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all he goes on all the way through this entire topic of the importance that we believe that something happened after the cross you see in the western culture in the eastern culture is is completely different if you travel east and you you here we are in the western world the focus uh is the cross that's why even in our protestant churches even our church we have a cross because culture or western culture has focused the catholic church has focused on the cross you go into churches today it's you'll see a crucified savior see a crucified jesus it's amazing if you go to the orthodox church in the east you won't see the cross you'll see a resurrected jesus with his arms reached out in the orthodox church and it's because they focus on something completely different and you know for me the the core and focus of my experience with the lord is not the cross it's the resurrection i'm i'm thankful for the cross but we just read if it wasn't for the resurrection that cross meant nothing right so he says that i want to key in on this word not to get sidetracked here but he says then shall the end let's read that again here verse 24 then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god so we know as we spoke last a couple sundays ago on this the and we wanted this dive right back into the teachings of this that there were specific scriptures that speak of the the tribulation period very specific to them and a lot of things that brother branham says here about concerning that we're going to follow just a timeline and i don't have time to share this entire document but we'll cover some of it here today but we spent a lot of time uh showing you that the prophet of god had a bible view he had a church view sorry of the bible even his own bible that he studied and preached from was influenced by a baptist church so after the seals brother martin makes a comment and he says the bible became a brand new book and so he looked at everything differently so that's just a simple way to say that we don't toss out everything before pre-63 by no means but we understand it in the light in which he understood it and the way that the the the revelation of god was progressively given to him it's in it's it's unique we brother branham's ministry typed the ministry of the apostle paul the alpha messenger and he said that last ladies and church-age messenger would be just like paul you know but the difference we have to always keep in mind is that when we study the message it's very different than going back to study the letters from paul in that the letters of paul are the letters that are in the canon of scripture that were translated and chosen to be put in with brother branham we don't just have the pertinent letters that were spoken but we have recorded tapes of everything he said from 47 to 65. you don't have that with paul we don't have every word paul ever spoke or wrote recorded we don't have that we have what god wanted us to have and this is the the word is the revelation of himself but with the prophet of god we have in a recorded sermon for every story every hiccup every uh uh uh i i we have every everything the the entire length of it so god intended us not just to be parrots just say what he said and repeat and repeat and repeat but by god's spirit we discern the under and we get the understanding of the word by discernment by having the holy spirit which is the teacher so without the teacher you'll never understand the message you'll get a lot of stories and books and and and a lot of a lot of doctrines but you won't have the teacher who uh who gives you the revelation so brother the prophet of god says a lot of things prior to when we said this last with the two sundays ago the prophet of god something happens in the revelation of the seven seals at about 12 o'clock one o'clock in the afternoon brother branham says i was just writing on the first seal he said i was just writing down just to say it he had taken from larkin he admits that he taken from these writers over here and he had all of these now remember remember this is an important point brother adam says the bible became a new book and he had a church view a lot of a lot of things he he believed the white horse writer in the book of revelations was jesus christ now we don't get up here brother branham did say that but in the seals he corrects that he said i was just about to write it he said at about 1 pm the angel of the lord came into the room and corrected that amen and he says that's not the christ he says that's the antichrist complete reversal now say what he said do we get up behind our pulpits and preach that the white horse rider is christ even though brother madam said that no we take the progressive revelation of the way it was revealed to him and we preached the truth so something happened in the room at 1 pm before 12 o'clock i think he says early in the afternoon prior to preaching the seals he said i just written it down to say it and he said the holy spirit came and changed it so we accept that something happened that changed everything brother branham had seen about revelations before prior to that it changed everything now it wasn't that everything was wrong i remember this it wasn't that everything was always the church view we make that like a dirty thing listen the church had a lot of it right because truth was always truth but it had it had he wrote it and he wrote it and he wrote it and he wrote it but there were there was traces there was a lot of things even a lot of things that we hold to be true today are mirrored with the nominal church not everything that we believe is different i love how brother richie said that last night this is clarity it is a focusing uh i love my my father-in-law as a hunter and he did a lot of hunting out west he said i look he said you he i remember one day i was sitting with him and he said you see those deer over there on the side of the mountain here we were on over in you know in arizona there's no trees you're just on mountains and you've got you know big hills and he's had a he had a tripod with a big pair of schwarzkies binoculars and he's just sitting there glassing and i i didn't have a i had my binoculars but i hadn't had him set up he said oh dear there's a deer right there three three bucks right there on the on the the hill there about 400 500 yards away and i looked and i said where he said right by that yucca plant near that little mesquite tree you see it going up right there i said i don't see it he said yeah i said they're there i said are you sure he said yeah get your binoculars out so sure enough i get my binoculars and now through the binoculars i'm looking at the same mountain it's not any different mountain it's not another hill over i'm looking at the same mountain but now i have eyes now i have binoculars and i'm looking at the same exact thing but i spot something i had never seen before because of prophetic vision so what was the message it wasn't we got to be so careful how we get lay our foundation it wasn't a new teaching a new doctrine that it's not the message of william branham as we said that last time it's the message of jesus christ given unto a prophet to speak so brother and says so many things we're going to use all of our time for that so let's go to the squeeze document brother um brother uh josh i sent it i emailed it a pdf'd it you said you had it do you have it or not i just want you to open the document and zoom in on it and scroll with me you don't need to put it in the pro presenter so brother branham says many things about the squeeze here i made this document back in march of last year if you want it you can have it i made it as a help a guide to study some of the things because so much especially good just make it full screen command plus we'll zoom that in then you can scroll to make it large um you and so i made this don't look that way for a minute while they're getting that ready to scroll to the top because so many things had came out so many things especially when coronavirus had started it really caused a lot of believers to go in and begin to read some things and look at things that brother branham said and i heard this and you ever you ever said that before didn't brother branham say this didn't brother matt didn't he say this over you heard brother branham and you don't really know you just know he said something and you know we said this two sundays ago a lot of times you trace that back and it's based on something he said but then you had this preacher and this teacher and this brother they said this and by the time you get it all out it's not necessarily exactly what he said and it can cause a misunderstanding so it's important to go back to actually what it said and so the pandemic if it did anything at all for the believers for the bride it's to me it's a lot it's a lot like daniel who the bible says that he said i understood by books that the captivity you remember that the daniel understood by books and he starts realizing hey there's something written about here we're not going to be in babylon forever so it was babylonian captivity oppression upon god's people that cause daniel to start opening the books up and going wait a minute what did god say about this so very much the same this pandemic has caused believers to go let's see what the prophet of god said about it what you're going to find is that you have some teachings that are that that go around out of based upon good sincere godly people even myself even us all can admit we've we've said or believed many things that lord corrected us and showed us later and said okay i didn't have that exactly right and so he says here i i i say i guess i wrote this here uh the following is a compilation of various quotes categorized by topic and placed in chronological order of the year for the subject surrounding the teaching of a pre-tribulation physical persecution of the bride before the rapture and or things that must happen before the rapture can take place much time of exhaustive searching has yielded what you will read below but i am certain that it is not complete and more could be added to the topic not specific i'm not seeing that too well uh no specific thoughts are expressed here an emphasis by bolden underline are only added to highlight the point as it relates to the presupposition again this is not a list of quotes on persecution nor are any quotes added for a rebuttal or balance rather this is a list of quotes that have been used to support the teaching of a pre-tribulation physical persecution of the bride before the rapture and or things that must happen before the rapture can take place so let's go through some of these then we'll pause and i'm not going to get to the whole document this is 1963 very famous one here that's used a lot but it will not be used in a great way until this council begins to tighten up when it does the pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze there's that word when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power see see see it's tightening and when that time comes and the press comes to a place to where you're pressed out then watch what i'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then see it'll absolutely to the totally lost but it will be for the bride and for the church so brother madam speaks i got this red highlighted here as to the topic the persecution coming 56 this is 1956. first thing you'll know they'll try to stop all of this try to quit praying for the sick and put a band on it just remember that when persecution rises the church it comes to its very heights then it's always the best yes sir god is working it all together 1958 why we are not a denomination what's not sure what's going on there guys i want to make sure they follow this here yeah there you go scroll down down down oh boy i'm in 1958. i just read 1956 there go up to the very top go up to the very top we're going to get it don't worry y'all all right this morning get it back to one single page not two pages all right so close it out restart when in doubt crash it out there you go i'm just going to keep reading they'll catch up so why are we nomina not a denomination but then after he had two little horns civil and ecclesiastical powers then he received power spoke like a dragon the dragon did before him so you just got to mark it down we are coming into a religious persecution with the same things that they did in pagan rome many years ago now notice how he says this for it's thus saith the lord that's all right you can just zoom in uh hold on uh let's find out where i'm at uh first thus saith the lord 1958 right there over over scroll uh zoom in zoom into that there you go perfect can you see that all right now notice first thus saith the lord a persecution coming next one 1961 scroll down and he says now you see why my voice is going to be stopped pretty soon but somebody's going to know yes why revelations 2 20 she called herself a prophetess you just watched the wave of sin happen now you watch core go plum to the core you watch modernistic watch ungodly things happen in the churches and finally there will come a persecution the bible says so thus saith the lord jezebel religion in 1961. now go to this i predict i think it's over i think it's you're going to have to go over the way you had it scroll up right there i predict that the two denominational groups pentecostal and evangelical groups will work together in a denomination we'll unite themselves together and we'll become a member all of them of the federation of the council churches or the council of churches they already belong to it all of them there will come through them a forcing or a boycott that will stop everything but what belongs to that union of churches the bible said that there would be a boycott even to such a way it would cause people to not buy or sell unless they had received this the mark of the beast which is romanism and the image of the beast which is protestant protestantism that the image the beast had power authority to give the image life to speak and and it did and that's the confederation of churches when they confederate themselves together now there's many young people here i don't know jesus may come this afternoon he may come next year i don't know when he'll be coming but remember if i do not live to see that day of his coming which i hope that i will and somehow believe i will now if i do not see it do not let this word ever depart from your ears in your heart just remember i speak in the name of the lord now i believe with all my heart that's the way it'll wind up there will be like a union a boycott all such places as this here will be closed down and you'll not be able to speak unless you got a permission or license from this federation of churches to hold a service it's almost it shows it does it shows it does that now even in the denomination it shows where it's at yes sir you have to have it that's where it'll wind up that's my prediction as a servant of christ through the understanding that i have over the word and the inspiration that's where it'll come all signs are pointing to the end you're following the thought here what brother and i'm seeing what he's saying when the persecution comes don't get scared there's a light said he would catch his people away shall not go through the tribulation she'll never do it he said she wouldn't she'll be called away how they gonna do it brother and it looks awful dark no matter how dark it gets you can't see your hand before you just remember there's a man here that can turn on the light he'll rapture the church christ is the mystery i'm just gonna read a couple more and we'll stop with this document christ is the mystery of god revealed and they're going to bring a persecution uh that's not it maybe oh maybe down to the next page i'm guessing i'm sorry guys it's not it's not the brother's fault back there it's how i sent it to him so he says they're going to bring a persecution on that's good there josh if you just scroll down to where i'm at if you just scroll down to where i'm at there uh right there this this the one on the bottom the second to last and just yeah right there he says then they're going to be they're going to bring a persecution on pretty soon notice now listen just listen don't pay attention to that listen listen here because this one's important they're going to bring a persecution on pretty soon and shut up all the churches see that in churches like this who's not a nomination they'll use them for a storehouse now these kind of quotes you could k if you go through this document he he goes all the way through to 1964 and he makes these statements and people have good people have looked at these things and said this is what's going to happen this is what we're to be looking for this is our expectation and you watch things in the news now it's so important to understand something i'm just going to read it how i wrote it to myself because it was just a note that i that i had put down um it's so important here that we understand that there's something very unique there's something very unique about us the elective i was saying this yesterday at the men's breakfast there's something very unique because we look at everything our perspective of everything is different than the rest of the world i think our perspective of life our perspective of events that happen in our lifetime are very unique our world view if you ever s if you ever watch any kind of debates between atheists and christians or you muslims and christians you'll hear this term world view they're taught it in school it's how you look at the entire world what is your view of the world of time of the linear line of what we call history and time but the the world view that we have is very specific to the bride in fact we don't even share the same world view as the rest of the church nominal world we share some of it but not all of it that's why you'll find the the church nominal world almost believes that republicanism and christianity are synonymous that's a deception now be careful you're not deceived by that same spirit you'll get a lot of people are you a christian i'm a rep i voted for trump didn't i wow when trump is no more a christian than than uh joe biden he said well he did good things well he might have he's a good businessman he had maybe some good desires and good intents some good good desires but as far as being being how are you a christian you're born again by the spirit of god and so this nominal world view is almost very patriotic very you know we're we believe and and there are some things i'm not take dismissing there are some things that are laced in and out of that that are true but we got to be so careful we're not deceived by the deception that's deceiving the rest of the world that's why it doesn't matter who's in the white house doesn't doesn't matter didn't matter the country didn't get any better as far as an eternal perspective when in 2016 when trump was elected it's been in a downward spiral and so boy i'm going to run out of time here and so we don't have the same world view as the rest and you got to be you got to get careful you don't get wrapped up into that stuff and arguments and debates with people about elections and then you get so wrapped up you have to understand your your message is revelation 17 come out of her my people don't be a partaker of her sins so that you receive not our plagues and so but so we have a worldview that is unique it's based upon the revelation of the word of this hour but because of that we're always influenced by a prophetic understanding of everything especially end time events so we're sensitive as believers to anything any kind of out of the ordinary occurrence that relates to presidents or elections or gay marriage or israel or russia you look at those things and you're always watching you're attracted to them why because you have a prophetic understanding of things by the random state and so you're sensitive to those things where others maybe wouldn't be as sensitive and so many other issues and let me just say this we've been wrong about applying and placing things in the past we've been wrong about it before well it was hillary well it was you know it's this one it's over here it's you know it's and so we've been wrong and that's okay that's all right you say oh no we better not do it again why it's okay so long as we have the attitude to say lord you can i i admit i was wrong and we allow god a space to interpret his own word by bringing it to pass and so we've misapplied things and we leave it to god though to interpret it i will just pause that and say very briefly i i do believe that kamala harris at that at that inauguration was the fulfillment of brother adam's sixth vision i believe that emphatically i've never in my lifetime seen anything more clear of what brother branham says and i wish so bad i would have the the the images we haven't even displayed it here i know it got it floated around a lot but you have brother branham saying i seen her a woman she was president vice president wearing royal purple have you ever called purple royal no no one never called royal purple now when you refer to purple you say purple you don't say oh what are you you're wearing roy oh that's royal purple you say purple brother brandon was very specific when he said royal purple she had royal purple on he said i've seen her who came into great power in the united states he said you remember you young people remember brother branham said this it'll come to pass it's thus saith the lord or i'm a false prophet and here you have the vice president of the united states wearing what i didn't call it but i can give you news headline after news headline yahoo news nbc news cnn saying kamala harris's royal purple inauguration you think that was an accident no it wasn't an accident and so so a lot of the things that brother branham says about that we it's very unique we look at things completely differently so we there are so many things that the prophet of god said is we just read through some of this document but watch what happens pull up the sudden change uh powerpoint that you had there josh i'm just gonna i'm out of time so we just got to sort of uh pull the parachute here brother brandon begins to say through all of this you can get this document from if you want it's just to study all the way everything he said because good people that's where i was at good precious people have taken some of those things and they've misapplied them and said there's a persecution coming they're going to come and shut our churches watch what biden does watch what he does listen friends i'm not looking to what biden does or the white house does i'm looking to what the word says and so but but many people believe those things now it wasn't that brother branham said those things and they're not going to happen but where they take place is what's important because prior to the feast of the trumpets brother brandon preaches this that what we need today i believe is some good old-fashioned persecution to run us together we find out the church is really persecuted go to the next slide go to the next slide but i believe my brethren he says and absolutely today i hope that the people are spiritual he says that it hadn't been about 12 o'clock today when the holy spirit came in the room go past that that was the seals there he says how are we going to lose this great race it's because we're divided how we going to do it we got to stay together we're all believers in god the holy ghost takes us all in it'll be a paradox if god ever gets us together but he will just trust him hold on the virgin birth he knows how to send the persecution that will run us together he says in a court trial and there is where i knew all the pentecostal groups come together then it will take a persecution now what you have to understand brother branham's part of that pentecostal group and he is believing himself a great persecution will bring all the church we'll all be together then we'll all stand together united as one church will all be one big united church what brother adam doesn't realize that god chose him later is that i don't intend to run you together but i actually intend to separate you and he preaches a message the seed shall not be heir with the shock and now his whole perspective of everything about united and coming together and denominational bears will be closed down brother branham realized no he's calling a people out of a people and he's not going to run them together will persecution come sure but not for that elected lady keep going watch this he says brother branham no keep going one more i want to read this one keep going keep going keep going right there oh don't you see where we're at now this is the trumpets pulse because remember just as in the seals something takes place and brother adam's understanding about the white horse writer about the entire bible something takes place before he preaches the feast of the trumpets prior to this message brother branham applies persecution's coming it's going to shut down our churches the squeeze is going to take place it's going to push us out church doors will close we got to be watching for that they're going to make them store houses but now watch what something happens here don't you see where we're at don't you see why them trumpets mean nothing to us they all sounded under the sixth seal you see now why the holy spirit wouldn't let me speak it the heavenly father knows with this bible before me that's the truth go to the next one didn't know it till yesterday didn't know it until yesterday so that means that everything prior to that yesterday he's referring to has to be taken into light of this quote here because i didn't know it till yesterday means the holy spirit revealed something to me in my room where he revealed it come to me and spoke to me i come back and said wife i got it now he just met me in there and told me here it is honey see there it is perfectly just in harmony keep going oh people without him getting quick it might be the last opportunity you'll ever be able to have you don't know what time he might come now the people say what about the so so now paul's that you can you can close that here we're out of time so brother adam goes on in that message feast of the trumpets and he says you see he says a man doesn't choose a wife to put her through suffering he says a man doesn't choose a wife just to beat her and and and persecute her he says she's already found grace in his eyes and he says and if anything comes he'll hold her hand to keep her from it and he says oh his grace is so great upon them and it's so great upon us we unworthy creatures deserving of death but grace kept us through it so brother branham's entire perspective changes on what takes place concerning the rapture and the tribulation and persecution say brother matt does that mean he doesn't teach anymore that there will be church storage clothes and no persecution no he preaches that but he's he places it differently he says the bride won't go through that she'll be raptured will this church close yes but i won't be here when it does will bombs fall yes but i won't be here when it does will they will there be a persecution yes there will but i won't be there when it happens will there be a squeeze there's already one taking place now but it's not physical it has nothing to do with our physical martyrdom but being martyred has nothing to do with physically suffering it has for the bride it's ecclesiastical meaning it's spiritual it's taking place inside of you right now there's coming a purge in the tribulation where plagues will fall and germ warfare and diseases and and they'll cry out for death and they'll look for death and they can't find it there's coming that type of purge but there's also a purge taking place now in the heart of god's elect purging out sin from our life right let's stand to our feet i thought i'd finish today and i'm not that's all right lord thank you for this morning father for last night the communion service i pray father that your word that was spoken last night the spirit the atmosphere that was in this place would just be a continuance today lord may you just fall upon us fresh again this morning and the worship in the singing lord and the ministering of your word in jesus name amen you
