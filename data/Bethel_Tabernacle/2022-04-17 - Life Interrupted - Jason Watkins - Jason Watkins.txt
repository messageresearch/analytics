the name of the lord happy to have you all in the house of god beautiful easter day amen and so i appreciate i know a lot of people were praying we'd have good weather we got a busy long wonderful day of fellowship but uh amen we want to get to the word first amen the most important part amen there's a reason that we're calling today a special day and we want to just look at that in our bibles today we're going to invite you to mark chapter 16 and we want to just ask you to stay in prayer got a couple of prayer requests sister phyllis wrote in that anna was still my poor poor anna suffering just the devil attacking her so bad and she's back in the hospital and wow so let's just continue to hold her up in prayer lord deliver her completely amen i want to see the enemy defeated amen and then um but the man is away ministering in arizona amen and i think all the rest of our team is here in town this week got a number of visitors glad to see you all wonderful smiling faces amen we're going to look at mark 16 this morning just a couple of verses very familiar to us and i'm sure you would expect this scripture on an easter morning it's actually the uh part of the text at least uh that brother branham took for the message it is the rising of the sun mark 16 verses 1 and 2 and when the sabbath was passed mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came into the sepulcher at the rising of the sun father we thank you for your word this morning a brief reading lord is all that's necessary when it's your word one of your words lord could create worlds father we have a great confidence in your word today and i pray now that you will help me to deliver the burden of the word that i have for the people that'll only work if i can get myself out of the way lord and let you operate your own gift it's not mine it's yours it's for your glory it's all for you all for jesus all for jesus lord now bless bless both speaker and hearer today in the visible audience and those across the air we pray in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated if you will bring up my uh oh thank you sir my powerpoint i want to speak on a topic today called life interrupted and it's been something that i've been working on for some number of weeks wasn't really sure it would work out for easter until the lord began to put all the pieces together for me and i want to bring a subtitle along with this advance one place brother mark and this is our return to sabbath i want you to notice that in the scripture they came very early in the morning the first day of the week all right so it starts out in our verse by saying when sabbath was passed so then you would find that they came to the sepulcher on early on a sunday morning because that was the first day of the week remember that the sabbath is the seventh day of the week which is saturday and so but we realize that as christians we don't come as christians we don't gather uh on the sabbath we gather on the first day of the week because that's the day he rose amen have you heard the wonderful news going around the world today he has risen amen hallelujah if it wasn't for that then our all of our hope would be in vain isn't that true so our life has been interrupted but we are on our return to a sabbath now by that i mean say well why aren't we headed to the first day of the week well we will in the new heavens and the new earth but first we got to go back and pick up that last week that got interrupted in genesis and that's what the millennium is about the millennium is the seventh day they never got to finish it it was supposed to be the rest amen but sin come in and interrupted and started the whole thing rolling so god is coming in our day to take a bride from the earth and go back and say because god never starts something he doesn't finish and he's not going to be defeated by the devil remember brother branham says he wasn't content god just wasn't content to see his creation laying there face down in ruin in the mud he said because he's he's god and he's not going to be defeated i'm glad that he's god and he's not going to be defeated amen that's the kind of being that i want operating my life if if he's an all-powerful being and then why wouldn't i why wouldn't you want him to be the lord of your life listen friends if if if lucifer has no authority over god's family uh and he has plenty of power now don't get me wrong satan has lots of power he actually he has power equal to god only except in creation god excels him satan can't create things amen so we find but god didn't create himself a 90-pound weakling god created himself a a worthy adversary and he's god's enemy and he's my enemy is he your enemy today and so we realized that calvary was a great victory of our god over our enemy and i i just surmise to myself when i think to myself i say you know uh if if if i don't live by the mercies of lucifer and if he has no authority over me and in fact uh any power that he does have he can't even exercise it against me except by my father's permission then why would i not serve my father why in the world would anyone serve the devil and instead of the one who has all the power and all authority in heaven and earth and has jurisdiction over your life it's the most foolish to serve the enemy i want to come to this first day of the week and and brother branham is going to make a statement here and i i don't know that i've maybe if i've ever done this i don't remember it in 20 almost 28 years but i i felt impressed upon my heart i have a number of quotes i actually just one quote from one service but it's got several paragraphs and i i wanna i put it in my powerpoint and the brothers are going to play god's prophet saying these words and this was impressed upon me by the holy spirit i was reticent to do it because i don't normally do it but i felt led to do it all right so i want you to go with me just for a few minutes takes three or four minutes back to yesteryear to a prophet standing preaching a sermon it is the rising of the sun let's let's have that with good volume brothers and you're going to hear that one of my favorite quotes about how satan doesn't care how religious you are you're going to hear that in here amen if technology doesn't fail us if it does then i'll read it anyway amen praise the lord i think we can get it though be patient son does it look promising we'll get it everybody look at each other and say he's risen it's a glorious day praise the lord if it's not going to go it's no it's not the end of the world yeah what are you doing g come back to it preach my sermon upside down oh i've never done that well i said this i've never rarely done this so amen the enemy's fighting it paul said he purposed to come to a certain church he said but satan hindered me so amen satan certainly uh you know we we call him murphy but that's just a polite name for the devil amen praise the lord all right i'm not going to uh delay so uh if you can get it in 17 seconds that wonderful and when he died germany is born for our sins but then there's many fine little babies and there's been many man that now that it is the greatest week in history the greatest celebration of all time this easter is where he proves what he is um but this is not the real thing and that's um think about that [Music] won't come up from the dead is [Music] what a question [Music] [Music] that was 2 000 years ago [Music] man 2 000 years ago what does it mean to me what does it mean to you now we believe by faith that he raised from the dead i don't think you'd be here if you didn't believe that you believe he raised from the dead if you don't you might as well go eat drink and be merry tomorrow we die at least you'll you know have some fun before the judgment but we find that we do believe he raised from the dead but what does that but what has that got to do with me that was 2 000 years ago one of the largest contributing factors i would say to so much tradition as brother branham would refer to it and people so worried about keeping tradition the largest contributing factor i find would be a lack of understanding all that calvary stood for everything that that day on calvary uh and not only not only what it stood for and represented in the past but what it pretended for the future the the resurrection and this is a very important part we're here today to say he's risen and we celebrate the resurrection the resurrection was a single and very integral part of a larger plan called redemption so even redemption is in two parts coming out of and going into there is a purchasing act that christ did at calvary and then there is a claiming act that he does at the last day when all the saints come from the grave and we which are alive and remain are changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye so we find that it had other parts of the plan that preceded it in the old testament and more parts that were to come after the resurrection there is a representation of that day on calvary all through old testament imagery i'm not here today to take uh so much of a bible study on that but uh the old testament is replete with all of the imagery of christ it's all about jesus christ brother branham said he's in every verse and every line if you can't read him there go back and read it again and keep reading it till god shows you the relevance of how it's christ see so we find that there would be no resurrection we would not be here gathered today we wouldn't be calling it the greatest week of all weeks there would be no resurrection if there had not been a promise from isaiah kept by god god testifying through isaiah god isaiah couldn't bring that to pass a prophet couldn't cause it all he could do is be a microphone all he could do is channel the word of god to the people but it took god for that day on calvary to come to pass there had to be before before there was a resurrection there would be no resurrection had there not been a worthy life lived and a willing surrender of all even to death so i i want you to feel the the weight of that this morning i want you to feel the responsibility of that this morning because you haven't you haven't made a decision to attend a church that's that's here as a tradition to us easter is not a mere tradition easter what what they call easter what we call the resurrection we call it as a prophet called us called it the greatest week in history but it couldn't have come if a promise hadn't been kept by god it couldn't have come had there not been a worthy life and a willingness to surrender everything even to death itself the resurrection the ascension and the return of his life into his kingdom of saints was planned before stars god's never been figuring this out as he goes and i'm here to tell you you ought to be thankful there's nothing you can do to throw him off his plan and so if his plan includes you there's nothing no height nor death nor peril nor sword nor famine there's neither there's nothing that can separate you from the love of god that is in christ jesus that's shouting grounds that's glory to us today but that's what he did what about us what does what does his his worthy life does that speak to you now think about it from young to old today what does it does it say anything to you that that he lived a worthy life and that he surrendered everything even to the point of death don't treat him like santa claus see that's not what he is he's to be your savior he's to be a redeemer he's the one you owe everything to hallelujah to live this plan before stars were created he had a plan to live in his church to bring her back to a sabbath that she fell from that's why we're here today that's what calvary made possible to take us back to our sabbath to take us back to our rest through the fall of the first adam sadly the exact same cycle of failure we find in the church history and the history of the jews in the old testament the history of the church down through the ages we find very sadly the exact same cycle of failure would repeat in the restored eve of the early church because as adam fell and christ was the second adam to because that had to be accomplished first adam failed to do it the second adam was not going to fail but then it also had to be a restoration of the eve because he was determined to have a family he was determined to have a bride he's determined to have a kingdom amen and so she would have to be restored as well and just like the eve of genesis the eve at nicea fell also in the early ages how did she fall by accepting a watered-down version of christ christ is the word now not the historical figure everybody believes he's the son of god everybody that's here today believes he was the son of god everybody believes he rose from the dead everybody believes he died for my sins we we we talk about that that's that's almost like a little card they can hand you all you got to do is say i believe in jesus christ son of god died for my sins well you're going to heaven i'm sorry it's not that simple there's more to it than that his death meant more than what you can put on a little card his death meant more i'm here to tell you this gospel is dripping in blood and it's not a cheap gospel and we must never surrender it to that imagery that it's just some tradition of man it's more than that they fell by accepting a watered-down version now now listen friends because today is a pointless exercise for you if you don't see yourself in these imagery i'm going back to the genesis i'm talking about adam and eve i'm coming to that day on calvary i'm going to the early church i'm talking about israel talking about us i'm talking about the modern day if you don't see yourself woven in there and you don't catch the application of what it means to you then to you today will just be a time you got to dress up and look pretty come to the house of god eat some free food and play some games and go home so what did they do this is what eve did in the garden this is what israel did to to god this is what the early church did to christ they accepted a watered-down version of the word of christ which saint paul called another jesus another jesus people say i want jesus i say which one you want oh there's only one not according to saint paul that he his fear was there you'd worship another jesus that he didn't tell you about and what would it be it would be it would be a watered-down version it's not the one that paul preached this is the battle god's family has had to fend off constantly especially in the modern age say why the modern age because satan's eaten here or though you're the generation upon whom the ends of the world have come satan's now had six thousand years to perfect his eden and you're living right in it right in his zenith see so more than any other age this is a battle god's family has to constantly fend off a battle that some of god's family aren't winning some of god's family aren't winning i tell you a servant of the lord i see too much of god's family who i believe to be god's family not winning not winning this battle allowing satan to somehow water down the the effect of the word in your life see minimizing and minimalizing if we would say the word as it was delivered and thus hindering its effectiveness in their homes and their families hindering its effect on those they love most now this was not unforeseen by the spirit of god i'm i'm so glad a remedy was promised aren't you a further there was a further promise there wasn't just a promise about calvary there wasn't just merely a promise about a life lived perfectly on our behalf there was more than just he would go and die and conquer hell and take the keys of death the hell in the grave and there was more than that he would have sinned that's wonderful that's an integral part but he also ascended after the resurrection and he also descended and came back into the church and that's equally as important as any part of it there's no there's no part that it can be missing god had to have all the parts in place see and so there was a there was a prophecy that the church would fall away paul feared that it would happen john talked about it peter talked about it they it was even happening in the day the spirit of antichrist was already working in the church not something of the of the 21st century alone it's not just here the spirit of antichrist has always been working since the early days of the church that's scripture so it was not unforeseen by the spirit of god but he did promise there was a further promise that god would come at the end time and restore a bride once more in the last days now listen friends if that's not true if what i'm saying right now because because sometimes you say that in circles and people go oh my goodness you're making more out of christianity than it ever was it's just about jesus at calvary and i don't know what you're even talking about but well okay then if that's not true then why do we have north of 30 000 denominations in independent christian movements if what i'm saying isn't true if it's not true then how did we get to to the differences between oneness twoness threeness baptizing babies baptized for the dead baptizing forward baptizing backwards submerging sprinkling mostly all done in titles with no no distinct name even attached to it how did we get if what i'm saying isn't true and it's not a true reflection of the church and where we are and we call it satan's eden then how did we get to the acceptance of the sodom condition in the world today the political the social and the growing religious acceptance of what they call alternate lifestyles there is only one lifestyle worth living and that's an eternal lifestyle the lifestyle of eternal life is the only lifestyle that god recognizes it's the only lifestyle that will survive the destruction it's the only lifestyle that will survive the judgment i want his lifestyle not an alternate version lifestyle not even a an alternate christian version lifestyle how did we get there if what i'm saying isn't true how did we get this such an acceptance at such a global level the canceling culture of the nuclear family gay marriages performed in churches by clergy in the name of christ tell some friends to bring back our sabbath week of rest is going to take more than just the observation of traditions tradition alone will never get it done to be able to restore it to you know to be to be able to restore it to we we first need to look at where it was lost from all right so because because this time when he restores it it's going to be for all time hallelujah never to fall again predestinated never to fall again this is what the message of the hour is accomplishing in men and women around the world young people today finding strength to overcome the evil one in this hour how many know that's true amen married couples dedicating themselves to a token applied home teenagers being filled with the holy ghost having overcoming power but able to overcome the enemy in his zenith in his apex of influence in the world and yet there are young people who are standing today saying i will not take the way of the world i don't want to water down tradition i want the bare-knuckled gospel of the lord jesus christ amen this is what the resurrection made way for this is what made the true easter real it's getting me back to my sabbath it's restoring me from something that i fell from because of all the way back to genesis i'm entering back to finish out that greatest of all weeks i want the devil to know i am entering back to finish that greatest week of all weeks hallelujah what jesus started we're the continuation what is it doing it's taking us back to a rest oh not just a rest but in glorified bodies that rest and glorified minds that rest think about what that'll be the identity of the bride now here's here's why what we're saying is so important here's exactly why now don't i want you to really watch this wording because when i'm talking about the devil to water down the word in your mind because if he can do that then it'll water down your lifestyle and you try to live in both worlds which you really can't do see it's madness to do that that's just enough christianity to drive you crazy see so so so when when we talk about not you know not falling for that then then say brother jason how do i avoid it well now we're going to move into some things that it's going to occur to you how to avoid it and that's what my whole subject is today i want to build out and say what was that day about how did it get to that day what does it mean what had it meant what does it mean forward what does it mean that was 2 000 years ago what does it mean to me today and so to first understand where it's going to we need to understand where it fell from i want to make this statement the identity when we and not a statement but i i want to say this as a as a sub topic of my sermon today and call it the identity of the bride of christ and this will help you uh brother mark let's let's open uh the bible presenter and and i want to go to revelation and a couple of places and a few more places so you just be ready there we i want to catch uh start with revelation let me see where i want to start well that's going to back up but that's okay we can do it upside down like that let's go first to revelation 21 9. now what are we talking about the identity the identity of the bride of christ because and it's not about uh just proving to the world who you are you need to prove it to you amen you need you need to know where you stand otherwise you'll have no no strength to fight the devil he'll convince you you're nothing and worthy of nothing and you'll believe him and fall for it and give up and faint see so the identity of the bride as i've said to you many times when abraham was put to that great test and and he's ready to bring the brother branham said he's determined to bring that knife down as much as i am to pick up my bible and that's when an angel caught his hand abraham abraham touched not the child for now i know and i just said for years do you suppose there was something god didn't know and god was like i don't know what's going to happen here let me see oh he's going to do it stop him whoa abraham wow now i really know no god already knew that abraham would believe him when push come to shove when it come down to even the son the life of his own son abraham would still value god's word over his own child god already knew it but abraham needed to know it abraham needed to know i will believe god no matter what see revelation 21 9 now the identity of the bride of christ and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vows full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife go up two verses or i'm sorry to uh chapter 19 mark brother mark chapter 19 verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready so so the scriptures in revelation speaks about the marriage of the lamb which of course is jesus christ our lord amen and it's jesus christ our lord and his wife so that's the first thing you need to get that that that he is the lord and he has a bride and she makes herself ready by the provisions that he gives her that's how that's exactly how uh esther uh was prepared she took the garments that were given to her by the messenger all the other girls chose their own way they all chose their own liking and the things they wanted to present to the king the way they wanted to look esther wanted nothing to do with her own ideology there was a messenger there and she said whatever you give me that's what i'll take and i won't take anything else and that messenger dressed her in the garments of god's word and she has made herself ready by being willing to forsake her own way see so we find then that the bible is a book of marriage you can take that down for the mark just stand by for any others i might want to get to so the bible then i don't know if you've ever thought about it like that the bible is a book of marriage see and so his death and his burial and his glorious resurrection at calvary was the necessary the very necessary preparation preparation for a bride first of all to take his name in marriage preparation a very necessary his death burial his life lived his willing sacrifice his death and burial his resurrection these were necessary preparation for her to become the lamb's wife for all the eternal ages to come world without end amen the character of god had to be restored to the earth in human form that's why jesus came part of why he came remember that i've showed you how that he was our total satisfaction it wasn't just our atonement he was a total satisfaction he was not only did he pay the price that you couldn't pay but he also lived the perceptive side of the word on your behalf which you can't do and fail at constantly see and so so we find that he he lived that perceptive side and he gave his life a ransom for many and so we find then that this character of god because it had been lost that that perfect character had been lost in the first adam and you know god had been able to show it through various prophets through noah through enoch you know through abraham through moses but everywhere along the way somebody had a little in their armor even joseph had a little in his armor it didn't matter who they were they there there's and i love that quote brother matt read here recently how that you know that when satan came to calvary and he you know jumped on jesus to sink his stinger of death at him said he hit a 5 000 vote said he learned this what moses this ain't moses son this is this is somebody more than moses you got moses to lose his cool and strike the rock twice breaking the type you got abraham to tell a bunch of lies and backslide leave the promised land you got you even got joseph to try to get his daddy to tell a lie to pharaoh but but when your brother said when he hit this one he said it was 5 000 volts and it singed his wings he jumped back said my goodness this is something more than i've ever encountered in 4 000 years oh my if you'd have thought about that he wouldn't have been partying in hell when knock came on the door he'd have been barricading he's coming oh my he's going to get just as surprised that you're going just as shocked as he was at his coming he's going to be just as shocked that you're going he's going to get up one of these days okay i'm gonna get my get my plan out okay where's he at where where where'd he go anybody seen him no in fact he's ain't seeing any of them we talking about they're all gone you mean all my plans are now worthless yep they're all worthless that that family has returned to the sabbath hallelujah see and so the character of god had to be restored in human form so it could then be shared with his coming church he had to be a perfect life the most perfect life ever lived there had to be a life listen you want to appreciate jesus there had to be a life lived that once and for all time lived by every word of god friends this is the beauty of the holy ghost see it was that perfect life sacrificed that re that made way to restore us back to fellowship with god sincerity listen listen sincerity alone while appreciated by god and it's not without value all right it's not without value sincerity alone is not without value but without the spiritual new birth then christianity we find too often is rarely more than practiced tradition see when you go back to look at the model let's go back to eve before she fell before she fell eve operated as mrs adam see see just like we're mrs jesus christ amen so the resurrection proved that he was the second adam his sacrifice then his death and resurrection uh continued his plan from genesis when he gave him bloody sheepskins remember that that was the start of it that was the first sign that's where brother branham says he's god and he won't be defeated he wasn't content to see his creation lay there and ruin because he's god and he won't be defeated and so he stood him up and and he said take those those man-made vines and leaves that won't cover you i can still see your nakedness through that the only thing that'll cover your nakedness is blood the only thing that'll that'll cover you you're you're being exposed to this as the sinner you are is bloody skins and so he clothed him in that see god can see through the hypocrisy of fig leaves a fig leaf religion you're not covered at all god sees you're still a sinner see you see he he has mercy on you he loves you it's not i mean if he didn't none of us would have stood a chance but he's wanting you to surrender those fig leaves quit trying to dress yourself up like a christian and be a christian get born again of the spirit of god see so you know one of the things that should be noted is that she was already called adam before she was ever even expressed in flesh before eve before you know the before the fall eve's authority in the garden was in her husband's name as mrs adam see and so so it's just like the child of god in prayer to god see that if eve didn't like the direction of the wind or it chilled her she would say to adam dear it's cold out the wind and he would say peace be still you see the model now there you are today that's your prayer that's your intercessory to god you know something friends i it's a it's it's a reality of the bible that that if you don't if you don't have a a deep passionate love affair relationship with your spouse then you sure don't understand anything about prayer you definitely don't know how to pray because that's what prayer is that they're that they're the exact same thing of the relationship between a husband and a wife and that fellowship and that kindred hearts that's what prayer i mean you can't the disciples walked with jesus you can't do that he's in heaven you're in the earth you can't walk go up there and see him so how how do you how do you expect to have fellowship with him if you're catholic you'll come here on mass and we'll turn bread into his body and you can at least eat it see which is nonsense and and and they say that's the body of christ it's not the body of christ so how do you know because i'm the body of christ amen and so how do you expect to get in contact with the blood how do you expect to get in contact with god through prayer that's why paul said marriage is this way it's just a model of marriage this way it's really he said i'm really talking about christ and his church see and so people who don't understand how to contact god no wonder they make horrible spouses because they've never figured out that fellowship with the spirit of god i'll tell you young sisters don't ever marry a man who don't know how to pray he won't treat you right if he if he doesn't know how to pray hey man brothers don't you dare i don't care how pretty she is and bats those eyes if she don't have a relationship with christ you run run as fast as you can see because the the bible is a book of marriage our authority just like her authority in the in the garden of of of eden her authority was in the name of her husband as mrs adam our authority is in the name of the second adam jesus christ amen that's why our authority and i'm here to tell you there's power in his name there's healing in his name there's deliverance in his name there's salvation in no other name hallelujah only in his name alone so the bible being a book of marriage it tells us of adam and his bride eve jehovah and his bride the old testament israel christ and his new testament church i mean the bible is is filled with all of these stories about this marriage it's a book of marriage it tells about the king and the queen living in a millennium it tells about the spirit and the bride speaking in one voice not a divided voice not a divided voice the bride doesn't have a divided voice from the spirit she has thus saith the lord she doesn't say anything now now don't don't think of that as meaning that she just sits with her mouth closed until she until an unction comes on her that's that's that's not that's a very narrow view of that what it means is is that she only speaks thus saith the lord so her life is a because that's your voice is your life that's why the bible calls it your chaste conversation amen it's not talking about what you do when you go down to the market and talk to people about jesus it wouldn't wouldn't do you a bit of good except make you a hypocrite and then and get yourself laughed at if you talk about jesus here but there's you don't talk about jesus here and there's no jesus there's no voice of the resurrection in your life that's why it's a shout and a voice and a trumpet god doesn't need me to go back and do the shout that's already been accomplished by elijah my stage is now the voice to be the voice of a live life and i'm here to tell you the spirit and the bride speak in the same voice see oh my it's not a divided voice not christ living one version of the word and the true church living a different life can i say that again it's not christ living one version of the word and then his family living a different version of the word genesis is a book of seeds it's the seed chapter the book of beginnings it's the literally the origin of all things as we are at least given to understand as mortals so for us to identify the bride of jesus christ the and the second adam we've got to go back to the first adam right brother mark first corinthians chapter 15 one short verse first corinthians 15 45. the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit see so now you've got a genesis adam and you've got a second adam that fell on the day of pentecost amen you've got that second adam now coming into you making you second eve makes sense see so the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit because it had to be that because god was never going to be content to walk around in in the body of one man walking the shores of galilee going about doing good jesus was never going to stay in that they actually wanted to make him a king and he ran from them see that's a lesson for us see we we want to let god make us what he wants us to be and so so so we realized then that that now he comes in to his bride as a quickening spirit see and so so what happened at the beginning from genesis then quite naturally holds the answer of how the bride will be reconnected to him if you want to know if you're if you're separated from him today and you want easter to be more than just a tradition then you're going to have to know how the bride gets reconnected back to him and just as importantly and let me say this just as importantly how the bride is identified in the earth as his body mankind walking in a very dark world would you agree and the darkness of his fallen birth he's to find light through you he's to find light through the bride that's the that's the whole purpose of the holy ghost coming into the church and because now you're the light see as he was a light but he wasn't never going to stay in one body he they he said if unless this corner of wheat died abides alone that was never his plan his plan was to live in a many-membered family and you be his body therefore the the the life is the light of the world just as his life was light of the world if that same jesus lives in you that makes you the light of the world see as mrs jesus christ and so mankind walking in this dark world and walking in his darkened uh condition of of a fallen condition he's going to have to find the light and it's the bride manifesting the light that leads them back to him your life isn't about living your own life and and and you've kind of got god like an ace up your sleeve to help you figure out to go in your life the way you want to live that's not what life is even about it was never about that your life is here to be a replication of the life of god in the earth to a dying world because listen friends this life don't matter this life's not about this when it's just training for the next one see so a main premise then if not the if not the main premise was that the first woman was made for adam now that is a massive point you're going to understand why in a few minutes first corinthians 11 brother mark first corinthians 11 8 and 9 for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man so there's no part of the plan of redemption i got you i got you so there's no part of the plan of redemption for you as his bride to go your own way live your own life chase your own dreams accomplish what you want to accomplish there's nowhere in there's nowhere in creation that was never god's intention the the woman the man wasn't made for the woman the woman was made for the man so so so we find out then that there's no part in this plan of redemption that has you going your own way deciding for your own self what's right and what's wrong i'm here to tell you it's not given to you to do that it's not granted to you to do that say well you know let a man work out his own salvation and fear and trembling brother branham said that's until you get the holy ghost that's only until you get the holy ghost once you get the holy ghost it's let this mind be in you which was in christ jesus see they did that in the old testament every man did what seems right in his own eyes that was fine until god called abraham you see i mean so so that that wasn't going to work anymore so so we find then that that because the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man so so your life itself was brought forth for his glory to take your part in his plan now if you don't want to be his bride okay okay then go live your life eat drink and be merry god be merciful to you somehow some way find a way but what i'm trying to get you to understand is you can't live in both worlds not on purpose i know we stumble in and out of both worlds i get that i stumble in and out of both worlds thank god that we have repentance and if we repent he's faithful and just to forgive us but you can't live that way on purpose you need the holy ghost because there's no no part of redemption that is designed to accommodate that you're either born again of the spirit of god and going by the mind of christ or you're not and you're going your own way you might be a pretty good person and got a pretty good way forward in front of you i just say okay go ahead good luck with that okay that's the choice you make that ain't choice i make as i've said to you i can't imagine somebody meeting jesus and wanting to stay themselves when i met christ i didn't want to be me anymore at all not at all see for those who are willing to surrender their life and take on his nature this might not be for everybody but for those who are willing to surrender their life and take on his nature take on his life take on his dreams can i say it you're here for easter take on his cross [Music] say oh i was doing good to you said that well let me just tell you for those who are willing to take his life in his dreams for those who are willing to take on his cross i have not seen nor ear heard neither have it in the heart of man the thing which god hath prepared for them that love him that's easter to me friends that's why i'm here today oh my eve was not made from outside material listen what i'm i'm now what am i doing i'm proving to you you can't live in both worlds i'm proving to you there's no middle ground like that in redemption and i'm proving it to you by going back to genesis the seed chapter see so eve when we go back and look at genesis we find out that eve was not made from outside material that is she wasn't made from another piece of clay or dust she was made from adam's existing material the self-same material literally not figuratively literally the self-same material is adam's body god took from man to make the woman you know there's gonna be some people on youtube watch this and go man that guy's doing nothing but just preaching a political he's on a political stump he's just doing we're going to cancel culture him because you know he's a misogynist i'm not a misogynist at all i i wish the whole i wish every woman would see the position the word gives her it's one of the most glorious things she was first in line to meet a prophet beyond the curtain of time if she over if she keeps her virtue she'll stand there as a greater trophy than any man ever did because she's a weaker vessel and pulled it off anyway oh let me encourage you sisters pull it off anyway in spite of the devil in spite of hollywood in spite of the world be a christian be a real daughter of the kingdom of god hallelujah see i'm proving to you there's no there's no way for her to have her own will she wasn't even made out of her own virgin material she she was made off of something see and so she was not made she she she literally is the self-same material as adam's body god took uh from man to make the woman and adam identified her and said you are now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh therefore her identity was in adam she was literally one with adam see now in genesis there's a separation she was and he shall call their name adam this before they're in flesh and it was only after they come in flesh and now god separates so genesis has a separation where god was separating eve from adam well today my precious friends easter is all about a bringing of them back together again we're on our journey back into god back into god back into god we're on our journey we're being joined back into god see so brother branham would say it like this and i didn't put it on the powerpoint i just wanted to read it myself it's short from the invisible union i love that title world doesn't see it why because it's invisible you don't see it unless you're on the inside the invisible union of the bride of christ there will come forth a resurrection day you believe it which the first will be last and they which are last will be first the old prophets will come breaking forth first and they see that procession going marching up in the air and we which are alive and remain shall not hinder them which are asleep for the trumpet of god shall sound the dead and christ shall rise first we'll fall right in line with them going in hallelujah all the way down through the age of luther wesley methodist criteria all the way down to the last age who received the word in their age i'm here to tell you something friends on that morning you're going to see something the world ain't going to see you're going to see a procession headed up and you're going to stand there waiting oh here comes luther here comes wesley here comes azusa here comes here comes the early fathers okay here's my place marching to zion oh what a morning that's gonna be hallelujah so god removed a part of adam formed a woman and then brought her and introduced her back to adam so she was at him in female form that makes sense to you so she she can i say it like this she was the bride coming of adam see now let's look at revelation 1 13. we've done this before i'm just going to look at two verses revelation 1 13 and in the midst of the seven candlesticks was one like the son of man clothed with the garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle now there's no question who this is it's the son of man it's it's one like the son of man it's jesus walking in the midst of his seven lamp stands that's the bible imagery but notice he's gird about the pabst which is the breast and that's a that's a female designation and brother branham said see it's one like the son of man it's the bride say but i thought it was jesus it is but well then how is it the bride right but it's jesus uh-huh well then you said it to pride you got it she is him he's in her she's mrs adam she's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh the bible imagery is showing what the holy ghost made possible now that's how she was at the beginning of the age but then if you read the church ages you find a sad story of failure you find a sad story of of of keeping the doctrines of the nicolaitans and thou suffers that woman to jezebel who i hate and and you how you're living in the place where satan's seed is and you've left your first love and all of these various things we find a very sad story but when you come to revelation 10 1 under the restoration give me 10 1 brother mark and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire i'm not preaching on it today but every one of these bible imagery is christ in his bride and that's why brother branham would call it the bride coming of christ see i thought it was the mighty angel it's christ it is united with her in an invisible union and she is him and that's why the world can't accept us because they don't accept him so in our day we are promised the restoration of this bible imagery see no wonder no wonder on this easter morning i'm coming to a close no wonder on this easter morning when maybe you thought you would come here and hear about pink bunnies and pretty flowers and you would get just a nice little traditional sermonette and then we could all go have tea instead you found out that this is exactly why because of easter is exactly why you can't hold hands with the world and christ at the same time you can't do it you can't appear in the world looking like the world and project the image of the word at the same time easter rules that out say wow i never thought about easter like that good think about it like that today easter rules that out because of the death burial and resurrection you say oh he did it all i don't have to do anything wrong the whole reason there was a lived life of death burial and resurrection was so he could come in you and continue his plan that's the whole plan of redemption you don't get to pick and choose you don't get to water it down you don't get to live a halfway life not in be a christian not and be full of the spirit of god there's no place listen friends there's no place in revelation 1 where we just read there's no place in the imagery of revelation 1 7 or ten one i think it was one seven uh 113 i'm sorry there's no place in revelation 1 13. and there's no place in revelation 10 1 uh there there's no place in there that represents the world they all represent christ all the imagery of 113 all the imagery of 10 1 it all speaks of christ go back and read it you don't find the imagery of the world in there it's inconsistent to say i'm the bride of christ but your world your life is on purpose lived in both worlds see genesis 5 1 i got 8 minutes i made a plan to shut down at 1. we'll jump out pull parachute it might take me a few minutes to drift to the ground but this is the book of the generation of adam genesis 5 1 this is the book of generation of adam and the day that god created man and the likeness of god made he him the likeness of god verse 2 genesis 5 2 male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created so adam had dominion and authority over the earth as a son of god yet he was lonely see and and adam you know in in and the bible says in genesis 2 18 and the lord god said it is not good that man should be alone i will make him a helpmate see and so it's adam here now say where was that loneliness coming from what was this longing for something to contact something to fellowship with there was he was inside of him and as long as she was inside of him she was like a pent-up fire he couldn't get to it it's like a an itch you can't scratch it's like the jeremiah said i was not going to preach anymore but the word burned in me like a fire and i had to express it see adam had this raging inside of him there's something he couldn't he couldn't go away from it he couldn't walk to the other side of the garden it was in him he couldn't go to sleep at night or wake up the next day he woke he went to sleep with it and woke up with it and it caused him to want an expression to want something more than what he was do you understand this was happening because adam in such fellowship with god that's how god had been in the eternities he had you and me pent up inside of him and it was a love that had to be expressed oh this bible is a book of marriage friends easter is the greatest marriage announcement the world has ever heard that's why brother brandon would say heaven and earth embraced and kissed one another oh the question was answered if man die can he live again yes here's the glorious answer job yes he can live again and job said i see it i see it and on that day i'll see him in my own with my own eyes my no my redeemer liveth oh i want to be a part of that friends is that the easter you want to be a part of today why don't you stand to your feet and say lord god that's the easter that i want to be a part of today i want to be a part of the word i want to be mrs adam misses second adam mrs jesus christ that's what we've got to want with all of our mind all of our body and all of our soul as the musicians come back deb just sister dev play something for me uh you're choosing just softly i want you to bow your heads with me i want to use my last four minutes for something really valuable really really valuable amen with your heads bowed your eyes closed i want to read you some statements that i wrote a statement brother branham made because i want you to think deeply today i i didn't even envision this sermon dynamically i didn't i know there's been moments where we get so excited it's dynamic and we it's delicious we love it we could scream and shout and jump in the air but i want to conclude this easter day the way he asked me to do it will you do that close your eyes bow your heads no looking around please honor the holy spirit i want you to just focus on my voice i preached this sermon today because i want you to know that it's more than just calling for a temporary resurrection of power some band-aid surgery in your life i just got a problem i need you to fix no it's more than that he's not interested in just constantly band-aiding your symptoms he's trying to he's trying to heal you from the inside trying to remove the cause just the piano please brothers at this moment so it's more than just calling for a temporary resurrection power it's more than band-aid surgery this is bringing back everything i want you to know that what i'm trying to instruct you in today is bringing back everything because when i thought about it for myself i said this is going to bring back everything i enjoyed when i was in his courts that's what restoring my sabbath is all about to bring back everything i enjoyed when i walked in his courts when i sat by his fountains say when was that brother jason when morning stars gathered for worship when all the family of god shouted together for joy when we were in our right minds i want you to know today you're invited back to that we have an invitation brother adam says in identification we're invited by god now that should get your attention because it's not just brother jason inviting you we're invited by god to take him as an example and let our character be molded like his what a thing my then when we let notice that when we let his character be in us then we have become sons by having the mind of christ mind which is his character your mind makes your character let the mind paul said of christ this mind that was in christ be in you let that mind of christ be in you it molds the character of a son of god see friends by being obedient to the word you literally are destroying the things that satan has built up against you and satan has has spent years building up things against you but do you realize that by taking on the responsibility of that day on calvary by being obedient to the word that you've heard today you literally you literally destroy you have the ability today to destroy everything he's ever built against you and jesus christ will give every bit of it back to you today if you can really get a hold of what that day on calvary meant you won't turn that down i wonder today while heads are bowed and eyes are closed i wonder if you're willing to take up the cross today his cross take on the responsibility today of what easter really means my hands slipping up everywhere are you willing to take the way with the lord's despised view what about it young people are you willing young men young girls young boys are you willing to come like rebecca came to isaac she put a veil of humility over her face and went forward willingly to accept him as her lord are you willing to have your sabbath restored now you want to slip a hand up say lord i want my sabbath restored i want my rest back i want everything satan has taken from me i want jesus christ to give it back to me i want life i want liberty i want happiness and joy and healing and salvation i want deliverance today i'm here to tell you friends that's what easter came to accomplish oh hands are everywhere let's pray father lord before i could even invite hands we're already going up lord my hands were uploaded as i've studied this for weeks how many times i raised up my hands and say o god have mercy on me take me back to my sabbath lord take me back to my rest take me back to an overcomer oh god let it be that today will be a new beginning of sabbath rest that today lord i remember that day when you came to me and you restored me you you took away all my old life and you gave me the sabbath of rest you said walk walk in my light walk up with my mind walk in my will i'll bless your steps i'll prosper you oh god you've kept your promise you've kept your word how many times has enemies tried to kill me but you've preserved me to this hour and i stand here today with my hands up say thank you jesus i thank you for these people i thank you for honest hearts teenagers lord little children old people married couples single raising hands oh god realizing this is what easter was about this is why he rose oh he rose he rose he's risen and because of that today i can have that peace i can have that deliverance i can have god's favor heaven and earth can embrace the heavenly lord with his earthly child heaven and earth can embrace and kiss i can come back into that fellowship with christ to take my place that all the authority is invested in him and in his name it gives us power over unclean spirits listen friends your heads bowed let me tell you a prophet talks about habits that affect our lives and there are times when probably in in real time right now in this building or over the airwaves i don't know i'm not a prophet and i'm sure there wouldn't be anybody in here with with their habit habitual failures not under the blood of jesus lest it be exposed i know how many times i've come into your presence and bowed my head first and said god forgive me a sinner don't let me enter into your courts where i should have praise and thanksgiving don't let there be any sin in me oh god but i'm here to tell you the prophet said habits are spirits say oh my heredity all my nature all this no habits are spirits it's not a habit it's a spirit god can deliver you of it right now god can give you a sabbath right now in the name of the lord you can reach reach up to him right now there should be every hand i'll put both of mine up and say god deliver me of everything that's contrary to your word anything that's not like you lord god hands up all over the building father we want to be free we want to be free to serve you in the liberty of the holy ghost grant that today that that event won't be just a 2 000 year ago tradition but that i will become a beneficiary of it today in my life amen can i sing a song i know you've probably got one in my life be glorified in my life that's good oh be glorified oh be glorified a little faster death oh in my life [Music] [Music] in my life oh lord be glorified oh be glorified [Music] in this church now raise up your hands and sing it in this church [Music] [Music] glorified fight be glorified [Applause] [Music] today in my life one more time now all together [Music] be glorified is that what you want me glory for oh every heart now [Music] [Music] [Laughter] lord we thank you for your love thank you for your word today it's meant a lot to me lord i thank you for it master i didn't get to all my material but i just felt that little nudge that's quite enough i think the message found its place today lord i think it could be an arrow of deliverance i think it was to many hearts it found its mark that's what the gospel is father it's an arrow of deliverance while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell lord we didn't we didn't need any any outside thing bringing it about just the word going forth and being believed and the holy spirit anointing it has set hearts free i know it came to me like that lord there was such a revelation there's been times in my life lord god where the enemy bound me up and held me for years over certain things certain complexes certain weaknesses this that or the other and lord and there were times when just hearing your word i was free in a moment i was free it left me in in its place was the light of god shining in my heart let every young person today take what they heard today lord and let it be a light to them let it be a guide to their footsteps going forward may we may we leave here today and this whole day this whole special day reflect on what easter really means what it made possible that it was one of uh of it was one very integral part one very necessary part the resurrection without that our faith is vain if christ rose not then our faith is vain why do we even preach but he did raise he raised lord god and said all power when he ascended into heaven all power is given unto me that's who our allegiance is to today lord we renew our allegiance to you today young and old alike we thank you for this service we commit ourselves into your hands bless our
