[0:00] and uh then we will let you be seated
[0:02] Revelation
[0:07] 3:14 amen I love the Bible don't you and
[0:12] unto the angel of the Church of the
[0:14] leody Deans write these things saith the
[0:17] amen the faithful and true witness the
[0:20] beginning of the creation of God that's
[0:23] some pretty good
[0:24] creds I mean you're not going to get
[0:26] better credentialing than that he is the
[0:30] amen he's the faithful and true witness
[0:33] and he can prove it and he's proved it
[0:36] for all these centuries he's proved it
[0:39] the beginning of the creation of God my
[0:42] he certainly proved that verse 15 I Know
[0:45] Thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[0:48] hot I would thou word cold or hot so
[0:53] then because Thou Art lukewarm and
[0:55] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[0:57] out of my mouth because thou sayest I am
[1:01] rich and increased with goods and have
[1:04] need of nothing and knowest not that
[1:07] thou art wretched and miserable and poor
[1:12] and blind and naked the perception that
[1:16] this age has of itself and the reality
[1:20] that God sees of it are quite different
[1:25] they're very much uh Polar Opposites the
[1:29] age feels this is this is our age the
[1:32] seventh age and the anointing that is on
[1:35] the age and that is affecting the minds
[1:38] of mankind is I I I have need of nothing
[1:42] I have everything I need I'm rich
[1:44] increased with Goods I have need of
[1:45] nothing but God is God's assessment is
[1:48] you've got it all
[1:50] wrong the actual condition of you is
[1:54] that you're wretched and you're
[1:57] miserable and you're poor and you're
[2:00] blind and naked and because of the
[2:03] blindness of man's mind today and
[2:06] there's a number of corroborating
[2:08] scriptures we could use I don't want to
[2:10] get too sidetracked today but we do know
[2:14] uh as students of the scripture that the
[2:15] Bible prophesied very accurately that
[2:18] one of the signs in the last day would
[2:21] be mankind would lose the ability to
[2:25] discern between to discern accurately
[2:27] between right and wrong so that his
[2:30] whole perception would go inside out or
[2:33] upside down um and uh he would he would
[2:38] actually believe that everything that we
[2:41] have believed is wrong and that
[2:44] everything we believed was wrong he now
[2:46] calls it right and it's a complete
[2:49] reversal there have been so many things
[2:52] happened in this last age and uh we were
[2:55] talking about it the other night in some
[2:57] fellowship so with some of the ministry
[3:00] here that you know I I would love to be
[3:02] able I've been trying to brainstorm for
[3:04] months how to make a diagram to
[3:05] Encompass that and just just show you
[3:08] all of the unique very unique and
[3:12] unprecedented realities that this age of
[3:15] humanity is facing today that they've
[3:18] never faced before and that that
[3:21] explains the madness that we see amen
[3:24] even even things contrary to Nature
[3:26] itself and Mankind is just complet
[3:29] completely lost his way all right and
[3:33] and here here here's why he doesn't
[3:37] believe that he's
[3:40] insane and there's a good reason for it
[3:43] he doesn't believe he's insane because
[3:46] governments are still functioning
[3:48] society's still moving technology is
[3:50] still rolling science and education are
[3:53] still progressing so he he says to us
[3:56] you know he says to God in his word how
[3:58] do you say that this age is a neurotic
[4:01] and insane when all of the stuff is
[4:03] still functioning and everything's still
[4:05] going and we're actually making human
[4:07] progress and in those Realms the tree of
[4:10] knowledge of Good and Evil it does
[4:12] continue to uh progress but what he's
[4:15] blind to is that the tree of knowledge
[4:18] of Good and Evil that the more knowledge
[4:21] he gains the more death is associated
[4:24] with it and he's destroying himself and
[4:27] he's blind to that he's unaware all
[4:31] right you would be blind
[4:35] also you're no different Paul said you
[4:38] had your conversation and the lust of
[4:40] the flesh the things of the world you
[4:42] were also by your very nature that you
[4:45] were born with uh a fallen nature you
[4:48] were also the children of Wrath even as
[4:50] everybody else see but God who was rich
[4:53] and mercy loved me while I was a sinner
[4:56] called to me and I responded have you
[4:58] responded today
[5:00] and because of that response that I
[5:02] believed his word then he has healed my
[5:05] mind and has opened my eyes and I see
[5:08] the world for what it really is amen and
[5:12] I see the word and I see my position in
[5:16] the word and these things cannot be
[5:19] overemphasized and you will do well to
[5:23] think about them all right let's um pray
[5:26] I want to take up this prayer request um
[5:30] sister Chassidy wrote a prayer today
[5:32] that uh She's suffering a lot of pain in
[5:35] her body and the devil fights our sister
[5:36] she had a really good doctor's report uh
[5:39] a few days ago and the devil's pretty
[5:41] upset over that so he's trying to
[5:43] afflict her brother Doug is also asking
[5:45] prayer for his father in the hospital
[5:47] with shortness of breath pain in his
[5:49] lower back and kidney area they
[5:51] discovered he is four units low my on
[5:53] blood and are trying to find where he's
[5:56] bleeding
[5:57] internally um amen praise the Lord
[5:59] [Music]
[6:01] um brother Aaron will you go on my desk
[6:03] there's um a card laying on a plastic
[6:06] bag with with some bedding clothes like
[6:08] sheets and stuff bring that to me
[6:10] straight
[6:11] away sister Linda Paris was watching uh
[6:16] last week when we prayed over the
[6:19] pillowcases for the lady suffering with
[6:22] brain cancer and uh she felt
[6:26] inspired um she said my goodness you
[6:29] know sister
[6:30] uh the devil also thinks her battles her
[6:34] with terrible uh bodily pain and
[6:37] especially uh in her senior years it's
[6:40] gotten worse and so she she felt
[6:44] inspired in her faith to send this and
[6:47] she says please pray for the complete
[6:50] healing of my body head to toe amen
[6:53] she's got a lot of uh there's pain and
[6:55] there's various other conditions that
[6:57] sometimes the old age can bring upon but
[7:00] it's just the devil regardless amen she
[7:03] says a complete healing of my body
[7:06] believing with the saints that the
[7:08] righteous prayers of the Saints availeth
[7:10] much God bless you all sister Linda
[7:12] Paris so she said I I'm going to send
[7:14] you sheets pillowcases everything she
[7:17] said I want you to pray over it and she
[7:19] says and and and I'm going to sleep on
[7:22] them amen praise the Lord now that might
[7:24] sound strange to the world but as
[7:26] brother bradam said I'll assure you it
[7:27] is scriptural they took aprons and
[7:30] garments from the body of St Paul and
[7:32] that when they were laid on people in
[7:34] the Bible people were healed
[7:35] miraculously we have seen it many many
[7:39] many many many many many times over the
[7:41] years countless times now normally uh we
[7:44] we don't we don't go to this extreme we
[7:46] have a prayer cloth and that and the
[7:48] prayer cloth is all you need but I'm
[7:49] doing this because this is where her
[7:52] faith felt inspired and uh because she's
[7:55] a a part of our assembly here I I I
[7:58] agreed to kind of uh go out of the norm
[8:00] and uh we're going to we're going to I'm
[8:02] going to preach with it here and then
[8:03] we're going to pray over it again and uh
[8:06] so if anyone out there in the listening
[8:07] audience if you'd like a prayer cloth if
[8:09] you're here today you'd like to take one
[8:11] it's just a small cloth you can you know
[8:13] you can um I I've seen teenagers who
[8:16] were in the world and a mother secretly
[8:20] had a prayer cloth prayed over and put
[8:22] it under their mattress and and within
[8:24] no time they were full of the Holy Ghost
[8:26] and we've seen people with and we've
[8:28] known of people with cancer and
[8:30] incurable diseases and in wheelchairs
[8:33] and get that in the mail pin it and say
[8:35] now Satan you got no right to hold me
[8:37] anymore and step up out of that
[8:38] wheelchair on the spot in front of many
[8:40] witnesses so it is certainly uh
[8:43] scriptural to do that and we've seen it
[8:45] over the years many many many times amen
[8:48] it's just something as a contact to help
[8:50] our faith and U even the shadow of Simon
[8:53] Peter uhu moving over sick people and
[8:56] they lame and the sick stood up healed
[8:59] we've seen that happen as well I've
[9:01] personally witnessed those kinds of
[9:03] things in my Ministry around the world
[9:06] Amen so amen let's let's pray right now
[9:09] Master we thank you for your word that's
[9:11] been read today thank you for your sure
[9:14] mercies Lord and your anointing that we
[9:16] feel and I pray that you'll be with us
[9:19] one and all Lord as we look into the
[9:20] words of Life be with me Lord as a
[9:23] speaker be with the audience as hearing
[9:26] Lord we commit ourselves into your hands
[9:28] in Jesus name name amen God bless you
[9:31] you can be seated and trusting the Lord
[9:34] for those prayer requests that we named
[9:37] out to you don't be for don't forget
[9:39] those amen from Sister Chassidy from
[9:41] Brother Doug from Sister Linda and then
[9:44] our families who are away traveling God
[9:47] bless you and God bless them
[9:51] now
[9:52] um really Richard praise the Lord
[9:57] hallelujah thank you brother Kenny God
[9:58] bless you
[10:00] amen wow praise the Lord wow happy to
[10:04] have Brother Rich we were in the uh
[10:07] men's bible study breakfast yesterday
[10:09] and a knock came on the door and we
[10:11] opened it up and to our Delight there
[10:13] stood Brother Richard In the Flesh come
[10:15] in gave everybody a hug amen wrapped his
[10:18] arms around me and started praying for
[10:19] me the blessing of God upon me it worked
[10:22] rich I feel it today amen the blessing
[10:24] of the Lord now I want you to just uh uh
[10:29] give me your undivided attention for a
[10:31] little while and we're going to take
[10:33] some more of our thought on in the
[10:35] presence of the Sun and and I just want
[10:38] to make a few opening statements now I I
[10:42] would like very quickly just for the
[10:44] recording sake because it's on archive
[10:47] and somebody will hear last week I want
[10:49] to make one quick correction that I
[10:51] misspoke on uh on on a reference to
[10:56] brother bram's message the anointed ones
[10:59] at the end time the false anointed ones
[11:01] actually at the end time and I made a
[11:03] reference to Pentecost uh being you know
[11:07] and and we were just talking about the
[11:09] the height and breadth of what Pentecost
[11:11] was and it being a jubilee that it
[11:14] includes signs and wonders and the
[11:16] restoration of the gifts and it's all of
[11:18] those things but we we found that uh in
[11:22] my heart I I I think it's good to let us
[11:26] understand God bless you brother happy
[11:27] to have you here as well it good for us
[11:30] to understand that that when we say we
[11:35] we want the to go back to Pentecost too
[11:38] often times I find uh and it's partly
[11:41] why I'm on this series at such length
[11:44] too often times I find that when people
[11:47] refer to we want to go back to Pentecost
[11:49] now of course we're not talking about
[11:51] the denomination we're talking about the
[11:53] original Jubilee the original uh mighty
[11:56] God being unveiled there in the alpha
[11:58] Church and when we when we reference
[12:01] that a lot of times people are merely
[12:03] speaking of because it's all they think
[12:05] to speak of is you know the gifts of the
[12:08] Spirit and and all of the various you
[12:10] know the gifts of knowledge and the
[12:12] gifts of tongues and interpretation and
[12:14] and there's Gifts of healing and Gifts
[12:16] of wisdom and all these kind of
[12:17] different things and then there's
[12:19] several three four five references to in
[12:21] the book of Acts which is where we
[12:23] always go there's references to um Power
[12:27] and demonstration signs and wonders
[12:29] but I I and so I have been trying to
[12:33] broaden our understanding that the
[12:35] restoration of Pentecost which is what
[12:37] we have which is what we were promised
[12:40] is all of that uh and more and it's not
[12:43] just limited to the book of Acts it's
[12:46] everything that we read in the gospels
[12:48] that was Paul's message and John and his
[12:51] Epistles and Peter and James and all of
[12:53] these various ones that wrote in the New
[12:55] Testament that's all part of the great
[12:58] mystery that was revealed R to us under
[12:59] the seventh opening of the seventh
[13:01] seal and in the book of Acts you have
[13:04] the indictment and in the book of Acts
[13:06] you have false anointed ones at the end
[13:08] time uh in the in the in the in the the
[13:11] Epistles you you have teaching on
[13:14] families and teaching on marriage and
[13:16] teaching on finances and teaching on
[13:18] children raising kids and that's all
[13:20] part of the seventh seal that's all a
[13:23] part of it see and but I made a
[13:26] reference to that particular verse in
[13:28] verse 20 Acts chapter 20 how that
[13:30] Grievious wolves would come in and and I
[13:33] said that's the scripture brother
[13:35] brandham used in anointed ones at the
[13:37] end time when I went back and reviewed
[13:39] my notes I realized that it's not I I
[13:42] think I said uh and I have a good friend
[13:45] who sends me the transcripts especially
[13:47] in these series uh so I can keep up with
[13:49] what I've said and not cover things and
[13:51] and and eliminate duplicity but but as I
[13:54] was looking back over his transcript to
[13:56] try to get a a a fix on where I ended
[14:00] last time that's better than having to
[14:02] go back and listen to my own preaching
[14:04] I'd much rather read the transcript so
[14:06] thank you brother Mark Coffey for your
[14:08] labors of that amen but but I realized
[14:11] as I was looking I said oh no I think I
[14:13] refer I said it's actually in the sermon
[14:16] he preached anointed ones at the end
[14:17] time and that's not accurate where
[14:19] brother brandham made that inference was
[14:21] in the church age book in the Ephesian
[14:24] Church age uh where he calls them false
[14:27] prophets false Shepherds uh false
[14:30] Apostles actually I think the quote is
[14:32] false Apostles and false prophets and
[14:34] then in the and at the end of the book
[14:36] that's at the beginning of the cab and
[14:38] at the end in the resume when he go when
[14:40] he's covering that again in brief then
[14:42] he he go it then it goes from false
[14:44] Apostles and false prophets and false
[14:46] anointed ones and he's referencing Acts
[14:49] chapter 20 I just want to make that
[14:51] correction for in case you go looking in
[14:53] the message and you can't find it in
[14:55] that particular message anointed ones at
[14:57] the end time it's in the in the church
[14:58] AG book Ephesian age and um and in again
[15:02] in the resume all right enough said on
[15:06] that now so I I want to make some
[15:09] statements and I'm I'm just going down
[15:13] over things that brother Bram talks
[15:15] about and recognizing your day and its
[15:18] message Amen Let me find my little
[15:22] device here and we'll bring it up so
[15:25] we're continuing in the presence of the
[15:28] son and I wish to take for my subtitle
[15:31] today recognizing your hour in Prophecy
[15:36] cuz I will assure you that you are
[15:38] standing in Prophecy unfolding and
[15:41] there's nothing there's no events in the
[15:43] world that aren't covered in Prophecy I
[15:46] have I have offered that many times to
[15:48] people if they want a clear
[15:51] understanding and uh it doesn't matter
[15:53] which which subject you want to talk
[15:55] about we can we can go to politics we
[15:58] can go to education Science and
[16:00] Technology we can go to uh military
[16:03] conquest we can go to so the the the
[16:05] social issues of the present the past uh
[16:09] as far back and and every The ecumenical
[16:13] move religious moves Christianity other
[16:16] religions uh leading all the way back to
[16:19] the ancient times of the Ancients back
[16:21] even before the Anatolian destruction
[16:24] and there's not any any era or any event
[16:28] you can point to that I can't
[16:30] demonstrate to you that the Bible
[16:32] covered that predicted that explained
[16:35] that and told what its significance and
[16:37] its meanings were and and and when you
[16:40] can take a book written by that many
[16:42] different men over that many different
[16:44] years and it all puts together like that
[16:46] and you overlay all the history of it
[16:48] and it all fits and dovetails perfectly
[16:50] I'm telling you that takes more than a
[16:52] man that takes a mind of God to do that
[16:55] and that's why the Bible says holy men
[16:57] of old wrote as they were
[16:59] inspired of God so these things are
[17:03] clear and uh and and we have no problem
[17:06] and I and I'm always happy to do it
[17:08] because I love teaching out of the
[17:10] scripture and I love especially love
[17:12] particularly love correlating history
[17:15] and overlay overlaying the history all
[17:17] the way back to the ancient world and so
[17:21] it's a it's a discussion I I love to
[17:23] have so don't ever think you're you're
[17:25] imposing upon me if you want to have
[17:26] that so we find that that concerning our
[17:30] day that the Bible predicted this day
[17:32] very accurately and and in one and in
[17:35] and in one of the ways one of the many
[17:37] ways that we want to talk about is that
[17:40] it would be a day that it would come at
[17:42] the end time that it would be a day
[17:43] where you couldn't exactly call it day
[17:46] or night but it would be something
[17:48] unique to the world that they hadn't
[17:50] seen before that it would be kind of a
[17:53] dismal look it would be kind of an in
[17:55] between place and that and and now
[17:58] you're starting to move into the modern
[18:00] era that we live in and it began to
[18:03] unfold early in the 20th century and
[18:06] this is why we have so many
[18:07] unprecedented things because mankind was
[18:11] you know groping in a and you say well
[18:13] he's he's been groping in darkness but
[18:15] this this is almost in some respects
[18:19] it's almost a worse condition because
[18:22] you know you know as you as you as you
[18:25] well let's just take something very
[18:26] naturally when you're driving
[18:29] next time when you're driving and you
[18:31] know if it's completely dark and you've
[18:33] got really good headlights then you can
[18:35] see you don't have a problem you can see
[18:37] everything your lights are striking if
[18:39] it's bright day then you don't even need
[18:42] your lights and you can see everything
[18:43] very clear but it's in that in between
[18:46] Twilight where it's just starting to be
[18:48] enough and you might even turn your
[18:50] headlights on it's not exactly dark and
[18:52] it's not bright day and the lights
[18:54] aren't really effective it's in that
[18:55] little in between area and you're
[18:58] actually have to pay close attention and
[19:00] things will surprise you because there's
[19:02] where the human brain is trying to
[19:04] process day to night day to night and
[19:06] it's in that in between dismal time and
[19:09] a lot of accidents in the evening and in
[19:12] the morning during that time where it's
[19:14] not exactly day and it's not exactly
[19:16] night so you're not in night vision mode
[19:18] you're not in day Vision mode and your
[19:20] brain is trying to make that switch and
[19:23] and and that's and that's certainly
[19:25] supported uh in in science and you you
[19:28] know that as you drive you've
[19:29] experienced that I've experienced that I
[19:31] was thinking about it just recently
[19:32] driving and and it was starting the sun
[19:34] was gone down and it was getting that
[19:35] that little where and I thought wow
[19:37] there's that scripture exactly you know
[19:40] and so so we find that it would be a
[19:42] time at the end time where society would
[19:45] have to deal with that globally and to
[19:48] where it's a a confusing time they can't
[19:51] see exactly clearly and it's not Stark
[19:55] dark enough to where the lights are
[19:57] actually doing any good and it's in that
[19:59] that gray time that dismal time where
[20:02] man can see kind of but he can't see
[20:05] real clear and this is where leoa would
[20:09] arrive at we can see governments working
[20:11] we can see Society we can see technology
[20:14] we can see all of these things but but
[20:16] then when we start looking at the
[20:18] craziness of the world it's like why
[20:21] what's going on why is that happening
[20:23] and everybody's got that question my
[20:25] what's happening to the world you know
[20:27] it I know it we see it it's in the
[20:30] news what's happening to the world and
[20:33] people the Bible talks about how that
[20:35] men's Hearts would fail for fear now
[20:38] when we when we think about we've been
[20:41] talking about the ripening of the seed
[20:43] of God that comes within us and that the
[20:45] word be ripened inside your heart and
[20:49] you know it's one thing to have the gene
[20:51] of God it's another thing to be in
[20:55] maturity it's another thing to have that
[20:57] seed when it's dormant you're not born
[20:59] again then suddenly you are born again
[21:01] and that seed has come to life but then
[21:03] even beyond that there's a growth and a
[21:05] maturing and there's where you're adding
[21:07] to this and adding to that and adding to
[21:09] this and adding to that and Paul is
[21:11] saying to people with who are already
[21:13] full of the Holy Spirit saying I want
[21:15] you to come into all the fullness see
[21:18] and so we realize that that this is not
[21:21] uncommon even in nature we find that
[21:24] that were it not for the sunlight you
[21:26] could never have
[21:29] you know in the larger sense of of how
[21:31] it affects the atmosphere you could
[21:32] never have life could not be supported
[21:36] and and Seed would fruit would never
[21:38] come to ripening and your fruit of the
[21:40] spirit will never come to ripening
[21:42] unless you spend time laying in the
[21:44] presence of the so n
[21:47] light see and you know and we're not
[21:50] talking about uh photons because I mean
[21:54] you know you you women know you can take
[21:56] an unright piece of fruit put it on
[21:58] paper bag and lay it in a lay it
[22:00] somewhere dark and it'll ripen and
[22:02] there's certainly no sunlight hitting it
[22:04] but that's not what we're talking about
[22:05] we're talking about how that if if the
[22:07] Earth would lose its sunlight the Earth
[22:10] would become a a frozen in uh
[22:13] unhospitable
[22:14] uninhabitable Wasteland it has to have
[22:17] the sun to warm the atmosphere and to
[22:19] create and your seed has to has to be in
[22:24] the atmospheres of the son of God see
[22:29] the right atmosphere will bring forth
[22:31] life as as old brother Bosworth used to
[22:34] say he would say it to brother Brandon
[22:36] and say brother brandom you know you can
[22:39] you can take a fertilized egg and put it
[22:42] under a puppy and it'll hatch because it
[22:46] wasn't the puppy that brought it it's
[22:47] not the hen that causes it it's the
[22:50] atmosphere that gets created around it
[22:52] whether it's a puppy laying on it or a
[22:54] hen laying on it it that atmosphere will
[22:57] bring that chick out of that egg that
[22:59] fertilized egg so you know this is why
[23:02] church is important this is why your
[23:04] prayer life is important this is why the
[23:06] token should be in your home this is why
[23:08] you should speak to God in spiritual
[23:10] songs and hymns and have a song on your
[23:12] lips and a and a a a song A Psalm on
[23:15] your heart and a song on your lips
[23:17] because you're you're creators you
[23:19] create an atmosphere around you if
[23:21] you're all flustered and you know it as
[23:24] well as I know it and and things are
[23:26] just hectic and when it rains it P and
[23:29] you know and and you're just you just
[23:31] feel like running from your own self I'm
[23:34] going to tell you if you can just quiet
[23:35] yourself and get alone with God and just
[23:38] begin to sing a little Melody and and it
[23:40] maybe at first you don't feel like it
[23:42] but if you just keep pressing through
[23:44] and suddenly the Lord will start
[23:45] inhabiting that praise and the
[23:47] atmosphere around you will start
[23:50] changing and it'll physically change
[23:53] other
[23:54] things I've come into situations I've
[23:56] experienced what brother Brenham
[23:57] experienced have a family upset have a
[23:59] wife have children have a have an
[24:02] assembly Disturbed and just come in and
[24:04] start start secretly projecting the
[24:07] grace of God and the love of God and
[24:09] sweetness and calmness and prayerfulness
[24:12] I'm here to tell you it'll capture
[24:14] emotions and bring them subject it'll
[24:16] calm nerves and bring you out and it
[24:18] it'll it's the best cure for madness you
[24:21] ever want is the presence of almighty
[24:24] God around
[24:26] you when you don't have that in your
[24:29] home and your home can be really open to
[24:32] a lot of chaos when you don't have it in
[24:33] a church a church can really uh get IM
[24:37] get out of balance and trying to operate
[24:39] gifts and trying to operate power and
[24:41] trying to operate this and and and and
[24:43] I'm going to tell you something you've
[24:44] got it that's why it's so important when
[24:46] the song leader comes and the musicians
[24:48] play and that you do your part there's a
[24:52] sending units and receiving units and
[24:55] the senders and the receivers join
[24:57] together and Harden mind and lift up
[24:59] anthems to God and then God comes down
[25:01] to inhabit that and then people are
[25:04] without having hands laid on them with
[25:06] no prayer being prayed I've seen that
[25:09] while worship was going on people being
[25:12] healed while preaching is going on while
[25:15] Peter yet spake these words I've
[25:17] witnessed that I've witnessed people
[25:19] being healed of incurable diseases
[25:21] delivered of oppressive Spirits young
[25:23] people come to know Christ the Holy
[25:25] Ghost be poured out I've seen these
[25:27] things happen
[25:30] I've experienced them firsthand I know
[25:31] of what I'm talking
[25:33] about so we find that you know no matter
[25:37] how much I would preach and I'm just
[25:38] making these statements from that from
[25:41] that message these are some points and
[25:42] I'm just making them as points of
[25:44] principle these are not necessarily
[25:47] doctrinal teaching this is principles
[25:49] that a prophet left us in the message
[25:51] recognizing your day in its message so
[25:54] we find then that that atmosphere has to
[25:57] be in place wouldn't matter matter how
[25:58] much I preach see whatever I would do
[26:02] whatever you would do it it it it cannot
[26:05] be ripened and other words it can't come
[26:07] to manifestation it cannot come to be
[26:10] Vindicated it'll never be proven in your
[26:13] life the only one who can do it is the
[26:15] one who said I am the light of the world
[26:18] so it takes the light in nature it takes
[26:21] the sunlight to give life to the Earth
[26:23] it takes the S so in light to give life
[26:25] to you you can't get it without that you
[26:29] you have a life you have a human life
[26:32] you your heart's beating your lungs are
[26:33] moving and your brain is firing but I'm
[26:36] here to tell you something friends
[26:37] that's not life the only life is the one
[26:40] that comes down from the bread of life
[26:43] from the Fountain of Life from him who
[26:45] is
[26:47] life amen otherwise you're just
[26:50] dying you're not living until the life
[26:53] of God is living in you and then when
[26:55] that happens you can never
[26:57] die wouldn't even matter what happens to
[26:59] the functions of this body it might stop
[27:02] functioning you might have a disease and
[27:05] and and your body gets to the point
[27:07] where it can no longer sustain life and
[27:09] you'll escape the bonds of your body and
[27:12] and Paul said if that happens don't
[27:14] worry we have a body already waiting a
[27:17] body not made with hands in the heavens
[27:18] reserved waiting
[27:21] Hallelujah and so so so now I hope that
[27:25] you're emphasizing and you'd be missing
[27:27] You' be missing my main theme if you
[27:30] just think I'm up here teaching Doctrine
[27:32] over these last several and today's part
[27:34] four I'm not teaching Doctrine I'm
[27:37] trying to get you to come to this
[27:38] principle that that you have a gene of
[27:41] God that's how you recognize God that's
[27:43] that's how Peter recognized Jesus and
[27:45] Jesus recognized Peter Flesh and Blood
[27:47] didn't tell you that but my Father
[27:49] revealed it and I say that thou art
[27:51] Peter you know Peter had said to him
[27:53] Thou Art the Son of God he said th are
[27:54] Peter and so they they they they they it
[27:58] was a recognition that they that they
[28:00] were they they had the same heavenly
[28:02] father they had the same Heritage can
[28:04] you appreciate today as a Believer with
[28:08] a gene of God that you share Heritage
[28:11] with the creator of all
[28:14] things that you also came from God and
[28:17] you also go back to God you also are a
[28:20] part of it and that's how you respond
[28:22] and that's why it res it resounds in
[28:24] your
[28:27] heart so these are things that the
[28:30] Apostle Paul said you need to think on
[28:32] these encourage one another with these
[28:35] things that you're Children of the day
[28:38] you're not of the night see the world is
[28:41] drunken in the night but let us be sober
[28:44] let us of the who are of the day see and
[28:48] so so we find then
[28:50] that it wouldn't matter how much I
[28:53] preach or how much music we play or how
[28:55] many people sit in this building we must
[28:58] have the sunlight of Christ amen see
[29:02] that there has to come forth a power
[29:05] there has to come forth the Holy Spirit
[29:07] himself to ripen or to vindicate or to
[29:09] prove or as brother Brandon would say to
[29:11] make manifest that what he's predicted
[29:14] would happen in this day and that's
[29:15] important because one of the things he
[29:17] said would happen in this day is they
[29:19] would lay their hands on the sick and
[29:21] they would recover and I want to see
[29:23] that Hallelujah that that he had given
[29:26] you power to tread on serpents scorpions
[29:28] and over all the power you've been given
[29:30] power over all the power of the enemy
[29:33] and I say I want to have that as a
[29:37] reality Hallelujah you shall receive
[29:40] power after that the Holy Ghost has come
[29:42] upon you and you shall be a witness I
[29:44] want to see that
[29:46] happen I want that for me I want that
[29:48] for
[29:51] you see so he we then we have to have
[29:55] this
[29:57] appreciation for laying in the presence
[29:59] of the Sun and that has it that's going
[30:01] to start with recognizing your hour in
[30:05] Prophecy amen when you recognize say
[30:09] what's so important about recognizing my
[30:13] hour in Prophecy
[30:16] because when you recognize your hour
[30:20] then you recognize your Authority
[30:23] because you see what he says would be
[30:25] happening not just in the world
[30:29] I mean that's the easiest part when I
[30:32] overlay history and show things that
[30:34] happened in in the world that they match
[30:36] the Bible that's that's almost Child's
[30:39] Play I've done it for so many years but
[30:42] but that's all that does is make you a
[30:44] good
[30:45] Theologian but when you can recognize
[30:47] what the promise says about you that
[30:50] during this time there would be a
[30:53] people and that there would be a message
[30:56] and that there would be a sunlight and
[30:58] there would be a token and that it would
[30:59] put the enemy to flight
[31:03] amen see so whether it's whether it's
[31:06] true world events whether it's true in
[31:09] the children of the devil or true in the
[31:11] children of God the evening light
[31:14] produces that what a time we live in so
[31:17] brother brandham goes back to hosea's
[31:19] prophecy and Hosea talks about how that
[31:22] after two
[31:23] days that Israel would be restored how
[31:26] that they would be dispersed first and
[31:28] Scattered for two days but after two
[31:30] days in the third day he would restore
[31:33] and and when you count that up we're
[31:36] today sitting just just under 2800 years
[31:39] we're well into the third day and and
[31:43] and so you say okay well can can we
[31:47] correlate it sure we can it was just it
[31:49] was less than a century ago that
[31:52] something happened in history that has
[31:55] never ever ever
[31:58] happened in history where a nation an
[32:01] ancient Nation completely went out of
[32:04] existence and were dispersed and carried
[32:08] and absorbed and assimilated by other
[32:10] nations but at the end time it would
[32:13] come back and raise a flag again its
[32:15] original flag and have its original
[32:18] government and that would be
[32:20] Israel Israel was restored as a nation
[32:24] after having been lost as a nation for
[32:26] more than two 2,000
[32:30] years and that is that is hosea's
[32:34] prophecy coming to pass and so indeed
[32:37] the third day he will revive us so so
[32:40] now brother brandham says so there's why
[32:42] your trumpets are coming in that's
[32:44] because this is all about the
[32:46] restoration of Israel amen see I thought
[32:48] it was all about a gentile bride going
[32:50] in the Rapture that's an event on the
[32:53] way to an
[32:54] event the event is him being made known
[32:58] to His People Israel amen and so they
[33:01] had to be released from the Ottoman
[33:03] Empire historically because the prophecy
[33:05] said they would under the first woe they
[33:07] had to be driven out of Central Europe
[33:09] and sent back and there had to be a
[33:11] promised land and and because that's
[33:13] what the prophecy said would happen
[33:14] under the second wo amen and we see it
[33:17] and it happens and and the bow for
[33:19] declaration and Harry Truman and Winston
[33:22] Churchill and the all of these things
[33:23] are going on and World War II and Igman
[33:25] and Hitler and what made Igan and Hitler
[33:27] so crazy it's in Prophecy it said this
[33:30] is what would happen 200 million demons
[33:32] would go and anoint them to to to do
[33:35] genocide on God's people but what would
[33:37] it be it would actually work into the
[33:39] plan of God to bring Israel home say but
[33:42] that's terrible six million of them were
[33:44] martyred but the Bible says that God
[33:47] gave every true Israelite a white robe
[33:50] of eternal life I'm here to tell you not
[33:52] one of them are on the other side today
[33:55] regretting or lamenting because they're
[33:58] in the under the altar of almighty God
[34:00] with white
[34:02] robes what does this life matter if you
[34:04] have eternal life
[34:06] coming the things we get so Disturbed
[34:08] and perplexed over we let the devil
[34:11] wreck our nerves and wreck our homes and
[34:13] cause chaos I'm here to tell you I've
[34:15] said it before and I'll say it again
[34:16] this life is not primarily about this
[34:19] life this life is about the next life
[34:21] I'm only here training preparing getting
[34:24] ready to rule and reign with Christ in a
[34:26] perfect world of Millennial world that's
[34:28] the world I want to live in and that's
[34:31] not somewhere in the Milky Way that's
[34:32] right
[34:33] here and they're trying to have peace
[34:36] but there'll be no peace until Jesus
[34:38] comes and establishes his King his
[34:40] throne back in Israel again back in
[34:43] Jerusalem and so there's your trumpets
[34:46] that's the hour we're living in that's
[34:47] the that's the time that's the day see
[34:51] and so they have been scattered and they
[34:53] were they were blinded but they would be
[34:55] gathered they'd be gathered back to
[34:56] their homeline Homeland and and ready to
[34:59] recognize the
[35:01] atonement they'll say you know when they
[35:04] when it's made known to them they'll say
[35:06] where did you get these scars when he's
[35:07] made known and he'll say in the house of
[35:10] my friends and the Bible talks about the
[35:12] atonement the the atonement is when when
[35:15] they come back the Feast of atonement is
[35:17] not to to for Christ to die again not
[35:21] for the lamb to be slain again but a but
[35:24] a mourning for that he that he was slain
[35:28] and they slew him yeah that their very
[35:31] Messiah they killed their own Messiah
[35:34] after waiting for him since the days of
[35:37] Abraham and the Bible talks about how
[35:39] that they would separate and and cry and
[35:42] weep for days like a family that lost
[35:44] their only son because they had rejected
[35:46] it see and so but then of course they're
[35:50] going to receive life and the Gentiles
[35:52] are called out and the bride is ready
[35:54] and this is why brother Brandon would
[35:56] kind of do what what I'm doing today he
[35:59] would say look everything you see in
[36:01] this recent history recognize your day
[36:04] in its message the things you see in the
[36:07] streets and on and in the government and
[36:08] in the schools and in education in
[36:10] science and in politics recognize your
[36:13] day because the Bible said during that
[36:16] time that you're seeing there'd be a
[36:18] message and a people that would believe
[36:20] it and become prepared and while he's
[36:22] getting Israel ready he's preparing a
[36:25] gentile bride to take a flight prior to
[36:28] the tribulation
[36:32] period so it's it's it's a story that's
[36:35] been told and the Rapture of the church
[36:38] well brother brandom asked a very fair
[36:41] question of me he's asking it of you
[36:44] he's asking it of the audience that was
[36:46] in front of him in
[36:47] 1964 it's asked to us
[36:50] today is it is it just a
[36:53] story that's been told
[36:58] is it just a myth to
[37:00] us is it is it something that that kind
[37:03] of sounds real and you say yeah brother
[37:06] Jason you kind of made a point there
[37:08] yeah that history is true yeah I did
[37:10] prophesy that okay I can kind of I can
[37:13] kind of see the X's and O's and I can
[37:15] see how it all lines up but but still
[37:18] that that's just something that sounds
[37:20] real I as a Bible teacher I can make it
[37:22] sound
[37:23] real that's my whole job is to explain
[37:26] it to you and make it sound real see is
[37:29] it but but but but brother Ram is still
[37:31] talking about something that that on the
[37:33] outside you know that we can believe it
[37:36] kind of like I can believe it
[37:38] intellectually because you're making it
[37:39] make
[37:40] sense I was speaking to a very good
[37:43] friend of mine in in Germany and he he
[37:46] was he just a wonderful man and I I'm
[37:48] trusting that his even his respect to
[37:51] Matt and I and the help that he provided
[37:53] us even then and even after and if I
[37:55] text him today he'd help me again and
[37:57] and uh but he had a he had a hard time
[38:00] figuring out who God was and he he
[38:03] understood a higher power and he just
[38:05] wasn't exactly sure and a lot of times
[38:07] that comes a lot of times that comes
[38:09] because of the confusion the church has
[38:12] put out to people and they look at the
[38:14] way the church nominal acts and they're
[38:16] very confused to say my goodness I
[38:18] thought this whole thing about God and
[38:19] then when I see the way churches are and
[38:21] the way people are and the way Society
[38:23] is and the way Wars are and there's too
[38:25] much pain and too much sorrow I I can't
[38:27] figure out I I know something started
[38:29] all this but but but but is there a god
[38:32] is he an energy is he a light is he
[38:34] something you know and and they're not
[38:36] sure and I was standing there talking to
[38:37] him and and we just started talking
[38:39] about you know the possibility of a God
[38:42] and and you know could he be open to
[38:44] that and he said you know I can and he
[38:46] said but I'm so confused because of what
[38:47] I've seen and and I and I and I've seen
[38:50] such a poor I said you've SE what you've
[38:51] seen is a poor representation of the
[38:53] real the the the devil always has an
[38:56] impersonation yes amen see and I said
[38:59] I'm going to tell you something you're
[39:01] you're not you're you're actually you
[39:03] know uh in a in a in a not a bad spot
[39:07] because you're you're a Believer trying
[39:09] to believe you just are looking for
[39:10] something real and there have been many
[39:13] of God's family down Through the Ages
[39:15] and that's all they needed they just
[39:17] needed to see something real it meant in
[39:20] their heart they knew there was
[39:22] something but what is it I I I feel like
[39:24] as a human that there ought to be a
[39:26] higher level than just than just human
[39:28] I'm born I eat I die a baby's born he
[39:31] grows he eats he dies I mean is that all
[39:33] there is oh that's not all there is
[39:35] hallelujah there's a creator of of Life
[39:39] who's trying to save a world and bring
[39:41] them back to
[39:43] life see the devil broke the
[39:46] world in in in in consorting with
[39:51] mankind mankind agreed to do
[39:54] it and I said you know I said listen I
[39:59] said I'm going to tell you something a
[40:00] very oldtime preacher said and was very
[40:03] wise and I said and he started talking
[40:06] about mercy and forgiveness and you know
[40:09] being being good enough and and and all
[40:11] this and I said listen I'm going to tell
[40:13] you something as a preacher and you'd
[40:14] probably be shocked to hear a preacher
[40:16] say this uh but I'm repeating a very
[40:18] great prophet God will never condemn a
[40:21] man for being a
[40:23] sinner sir never because the man was
[40:26] born a sinner it's not even his fault
[40:28] the Creator knows that he was born into
[40:30] it it's like a shotgun wedding you got
[40:32] trapped into it you
[40:35] see and brother Ram called it that the
[40:37] old shotgun wedding you that's from you
[40:39] young people probably don't know what
[40:40] that is amen but but but anyway God
[40:44] would never condemn a man for being a
[40:46] sinner because the man was born a
[40:48] sinner that what would condemn the man
[40:51] is that he remained in that state when
[40:53] he didn't have to that God sending his
[40:56] son in Christ died for that sin so that
[40:58] you by accepting that atonement dying
[41:01] for you that Christ took your place at
[41:04] Calvary and can absolve you of every sin
[41:07] and your birth your wrong birth
[41:09] transgressions anything that happens in
[41:11] your life by your faith in the in the
[41:14] atonement you can gain eternal life and
[41:17] you won't have to die so you find that
[41:20] the that the man the sinner who dies
[41:23] condemns his own self because he refused
[41:26] to accept the their pardon because we
[41:28] know that a pardon is only a pardon if
[41:31] it's received as a
[41:34] pardon I don't know why I'm hearing all
[41:36] of that I keep hearing I don't know if
[41:38] I'm hearing that uh but maybe just turn
[41:41] my monitors down because distracting
[41:44] me so so we find
[41:47] that that this God is very real and and
[41:51] he wants to be known and how that and
[41:53] that and he said to me he said he said
[41:57] he started calling me brother Jason he
[41:58] said I I've never I've never heard it
[42:01] explained like that I said well you have
[42:03] now I said there's a real God and and I
[42:07] said how do you know but what he flew my
[42:09] son and I halfway around the world and
[42:11] had you be our Uber driver because he he
[42:13] was you say would God do that you better
[42:16] believe he would do that he would cross
[42:18] the Seas he'd cross the Seven Seas to
[42:20] find one child that's why your life
[42:23] should be dedicated to God you don't
[42:25] know who you might rub shoulders with
[42:27] out there in the world you need to have
[42:29] the the aura and the atmospheres of
[42:31] eternal life moving around you
[42:35] hallelujah
[42:39] amen so we find that it's about you know
[42:43] brother Brandon would say so is it is
[42:46] this something that is just convincing
[42:50] teaching does it you you believe it or
[42:53] because it makes sense see he said says
[42:57] or or what a big or or is it something
[43:03] that's in us that's a part of us that is
[43:06] more than life to us and I say right
[43:09] there that's exactly where I'm at
[43:11] there's something about it when I read
[43:13] it it's in me it's a part of me when I
[43:16] pray when I talk to the Lord when I read
[43:18] the message when I hear a tape there's
[43:20] something in me to start saying amen
[43:22] amen that's a familiar voice when I when
[43:25] I see the power of God move when I see
[43:28] him in your lives when I see God moving
[43:31] in your families I say there's a real
[43:33] God when I see the sick healed I say
[43:35] there's a real God when I know my own
[43:38] life can experience the power and the
[43:40] demonstration and I can be delivered of
[43:43] all manner of evil then I know there's a
[43:45] real God and a real word who has a real
[43:48] love and a and I have a real
[43:50] faith not just because I've been
[43:53] convinced
[43:54] doctrinally but because it's been made
[43:57] alive to me so what attitude then do we
[44:00] set in this morning is that a fair
[44:02] question Amen in this
[44:06] Tabernacle so which one are you yeah are
[44:11] you just convinced by
[44:12] teaching because it makes sense to
[44:16] you see you you've heard me make that
[44:19] challenge around the world there's no
[44:20] one that can disprove what we believe
[44:23] not using this
[44:24] book no by no means because this is the
[44:27] only one we teach out of but but even
[44:30] that wouldn't save them even if I could
[44:33] prove it and I've done it and it's still
[44:35] didn't save them see it's the mercy of
[44:38] God to come down and that God has to
[44:41] drop that sunlight down into your heart
[44:43] so what should be your attitude today
[44:45] God drop that down upon me today
[44:48] Lord otherwise there's no way for you to
[44:51] get there it's only whom the son will
[44:52] reveal himself to but he will will rece
[44:57] respond to a humble heart who will ask
[44:59] him for
[45:01] it just like a a child with a loving
[45:04] father and Jesus said if you ask your
[45:06] father you're hungry as a child and you
[45:08] ask him for fish or bread would he give
[45:10] you a stone or would he give you a
[45:12] serpent see said what doesn't your
[45:15] heavenly father much more love you than
[45:17] your Earthly father amen see so he will
[45:21] he'll open the windows of
[45:23] Heaven he'll come down to you today
[45:26] he'll come down to right where you're
[45:28] sitting right now in this Tabernacle and
[45:31] make himself known to you if you ask him
[45:33] to in a humble way amen he says the the
[45:37] the church has forgot its prophets now
[45:39] here here I'm kind of starting to come
[45:41] down now to where we you know took a
[45:44] pause last Sunday and the church has
[45:48] forgot their prophets see they don't
[45:50] need them anymore remember the text I'm
[45:52] rich I'm increased with Goods I have
[45:53] need of nothing see they don't need them
[45:56] anymore they claim see and that's the
[45:59] reason that's the reason they're in the
[46:01] condition they are the reason the world
[46:03] is in the condition it's in is because
[46:04] it has this belief I have need of
[46:07] nothing I have everything I need and
[46:10] that's the reason they're naked and
[46:11] miserable and blind wretched and don't
[46:13] know it because they don't
[46:16] recognize the hour they're living
[46:23] in brother brandom said it like this and
[46:26] it's a strange way of saying it he says
[46:30] that's the reason they are naked and
[46:33] blind and wretched and don't know it
[46:34] because they don't recognize the hour
[46:36] we're living in and he says they don't
[46:39] notice
[46:43] it now you're starting to understand
[46:46] why and now you're now you're catching
[46:50] the the story behind the story the world
[46:53] this is why Satan fills up your life
[46:56] with so many
[46:58] distractions and he'll use whatever he's
[47:00] got to do political Intrigue Global you
[47:03] know conspiracy uh technology science
[47:08] education learning entertainments he'll
[47:11] he'll flood your mind with every kind of
[47:16] distraction he can come up with and he
[47:18] can come up with a lot of them to do
[47:21] what so you won't notice you might sit
[47:25] here and believe what I'm saying
[47:27] doctrinally as a as a scriptural
[47:29] principle and say brother Jason I get it
[47:31] you've convinced me I believe it but you
[47:33] still won't notice the condition you're
[47:36] in
[47:38] see so this is where I I read to you
[47:41] last time and I'm not going to read it
[47:43] again on the screen that's that's the
[47:46] the thing that's the matter with the
[47:47] message today now this
[47:52] is here's where such a burden in my
[47:55] heart has been because brother brandham
[47:59] now he's not talking about Pentecost or
[48:00] the Pentecostal church or Methodist
[48:02] Baptists lutherans Catholics whatever
[48:04] he's got a plenty to say about that in
[48:06] our part two I think we read you a whole
[48:09] whole bunch of quotes where he talked
[48:11] about things that went on in the
[48:12] Pentecostal church it was obvious he's
[48:14] talking to them and not to the message
[48:16] churches because they were doing things
[48:18] we don't do denying the word and women
[48:19] dressing this way and men and we and
[48:21] they didn't believe and didn't baptize
[48:22] right well he certainly wasn't talking
[48:24] about us but now he comes to us this the
[48:27] thing that's the matter with the message
[48:30] today see and so I said I thought my I
[48:35] want to know what's wrong here's what's
[48:37] here's what's wrong if there's something
[48:39] wrong in the message today here it is is
[48:42] those who obtain it in their hearts must
[48:46] must lay in the presence of the sun to
[48:49] get
[48:51] ripened and if Satan wants to distract
[48:54] you from anything it's that amen he will
[48:58] use a career and family and friends and
[49:01] entertainment Recreation he'll use he'll
[49:03] use legit things that you really that
[49:06] really do require your time like making
[49:08] a living and getting an education and
[49:10] those are totally legit things that you
[49:12] have to do we do have to have the
[49:14] functions of living we can't be so
[49:16] Heavenly minded that I'm no earthly good
[49:18] I do got to live here I do got families
[49:20] to raise I do got bills to pay I do got
[49:22] you know and that's all legitimate stuff
[49:25] but what he's trying to get you to do is
[49:27] just be absorbed by all of that so that
[49:29] you don't you don't segment or a lot
[49:33] premium time to laying in the presence
[49:36] of the Sun and hence the seed Gene that
[49:39] you have that gives you the ability to
[49:40] believe the message never gets ripened
[49:43] and therefore you never really have that
[49:45] that wonderful moist experience you
[49:48] never have that that oozing power and
[49:50] that oozing anointing and that that
[49:53] flowing that when you walk around it
[49:55] just begins to flow around and it it'll
[49:57] it saves your children and heals
[49:59] marriages and heals the body and heals
[50:02] the mind and and and and this is what's
[50:04] wrong in the
[50:06] message according to
[50:09] him the problem is
[50:12] not intellectualism versus
[50:17] emotionalism that when you make it that
[50:19] all that is is like you're trying to
[50:22] talk about a civil war that as far as I
[50:24] can tell doesn't even exist
[50:27] right I don't know any message churches
[50:30] that follow intellectualism only and
[50:33] deny any emotion of the spirit and I I
[50:35] don't know any I I've seen churches like
[50:38] that but not in this
[50:40] message I don't know any that only want
[50:44] emotionalism and and don't and don't
[50:46] want anything to do with the word so the
[50:49] devil is creating this fake
[50:52] War as a distraction from what the real
[50:56] problem problem is is that you need to
[50:59] ripen you need to ripen that's the real
[51:01] need it's not about preaching deeper
[51:04] things and it's not about working you
[51:06] into a into an emotional state I'm for
[51:09] teaching the Deep things of God and I'm
[51:11] for encouraging emotion and encouraging
[51:14] you to get out of your comfort zone and
[51:16] break all the crust and rust off of you
[51:18] and raise a hand and wave it to God and
[51:21] hop up and down and say Glory Hallelujah
[51:24] say well I don't feel it well start
[51:25] saying and you'll feel I'm here to tell
[51:27] you there's nothing wrong with
[51:30] that but still yet that's not the
[51:32] emphasis that's not what he identifies
[51:35] as the problem the problem is ripening
[51:37] or the lack thereof amen so the answer
[51:41] is laying in the presence of the son and
[51:44] that speaks of sincerity before God
[51:47] Consecration and dedication and a prayer
[51:50] life and a church attendance and Bible
[51:52] reading and tape listing and fellowship
[51:53] of the Saints it's all adding to your
[51:55] faith and adding to this and adding to
[51:57] that and adding to
[51:59] this this is what's needed bethl
[52:02] Tabernacle
[52:04] am
[52:05] see laying in the presence of the sun to
[52:08] get
[52:12] ripened sometimes what shocks me is
[52:15] churches that I look at and see ripe
[52:18] ripe fruit I see the real power of God
[52:21] and I see a I see deep teaching and
[52:24] great and great emotion and and and it's
[52:26] all legit and driven by the Holy Spirit
[52:29] and I and I want to say to them okay
[52:31] what are you screaming about you you've
[52:34] got everything you need why why why why
[52:38] you know why you trying to create a war
[52:41] that doesn't even exist that's
[52:44] right oh well there's churches that are
[52:46] against emotion I don't know of one not
[52:48] a message
[52:51] Church remember just CA you are a
[52:54] follower of the
[52:56] message doesn't make you a
[52:59] believer in the
[53:01] word so there might be people who follow
[53:04] the teachings and and maybe they've got
[53:06] weaknesses in that and weaknesses in
[53:08] this and but I'm here to tell you when
[53:10] it comes to the real seed Gene God the
[53:12] real family of God the mainstream of the
[53:15] message I get we have fanaticism on the
[53:16] fringes you're always going to have that
[53:18] it's never not been Moses had that
[53:21] they've always had that you're always
[53:23] going to have that as a friend you're
[53:24] always going to have a COR and Dayan
[53:26] you're always going to have Believers
[53:27] make Believers and unbelievers but why
[53:29] spend all my time War at warning you of
[53:32] what you already know and and and you
[53:34] you you avoid hearing what you're
[53:36] hearing today that you got to lay in the
[53:38] presence of the Sun and be ripen and
[53:40] then you won't have to worry about the
[53:42] power of God it'll move
[53:44] automatically not CA you chase it but
[53:48] because it flows it follows the believer
[53:53] amen oh my I don't even want want to I
[53:57] told I told the ministers I said I
[53:59] definitely don't want to create a war
[54:01] talking about a
[54:05] war create a conflict about the conflict
[54:08] when there is no conflict there is no
[54:10] war I'm here to tell you the Bride of
[54:11] Jesus Christ is Marching In the step of
[54:13] the Gospel all around the world she's in
[54:15] love with Christ and in love with the
[54:17] word and the power of God moves among
[54:18] her and I've sailed the seven seas and
[54:21] I've been around I know what I'm
[54:22] speaking of friends the ma the family of
[54:25] God is in love with his
[54:27] word
[54:30] amen so this is where so so I'm not even
[54:35] here to even preach on those things why
[54:38] why would I why would I you know preach
[54:40] on those things when we already have a
[54:42] mature word and a mature approach and
[54:44] mature people God bless you I see a lot
[54:47] of spiritual maturity you're such an
[54:49] encouragement to me I mean that so
[54:52] sincerely don't think I can't come under
[54:55] the mental attack and strength of the
[54:56] enemy and when he when he does I just
[54:58] start thinking about all you people and
[55:00] how you love me and you praying for me
[55:01] and you believe in you come to church
[55:03] and you raise your hands and you wave
[55:04] them and you say amen and I just say
[55:07] well if I'm if I'm so wrong devil how
[55:09] did that get
[55:10] produced how how is it a church of
[55:12] people who love God and believe in the
[55:15] power of the Risen
[55:16] Christ
[55:19] Hallelujah
[55:20] see
[55:23] so the last time we talked about where
[55:25] he said laying in the the presence of
[55:26] the sun to be ripened the word to be
[55:29] ripened in your heart to bring forth and
[55:31] live what we're talking
[55:34] about see now I'm watching clock don't
[55:37] get
[55:42] nervous yeah I I will it's your time I
[55:45] get worried about but I'll take plenty
[55:48] I'll take all of mine but it's how much
[55:50] of yours I take that I get a little amen
[55:53] thank you brother Richard amen praise
[55:54] the Lord so good to hear your voice
[55:56] buddy amen wow oh my so so then I we we
[56:03] come
[56:05] to uh our
[56:07] verse because thou sayest I am rich and
[56:10] increased with goods and have need o of
[56:14] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[56:16] wretched and miserable and poor and
[56:19] blind and
[56:22] Naked Brother Brian says in the in the I
[56:24] think this is out of the L to see in
[56:26] church age in the cab the church is
[56:30] complacent now here he's he's
[56:32] interpreting this verse the church is
[56:34] complacent she is satisfied with what
[56:37] she has she either figures she has it
[56:40] all or has enough see and so he
[56:46] says
[56:48] um compare this 20th century Church to
[56:51] the first century Church go ahead do
[56:53] that I I love that because he's actually
[56:57] not afraid to have you take a serious
[57:00] look at at history he's not afraid to
[57:03] have you really think about the word of
[57:05] God I mean you've got to be confident
[57:06] you're teaching the word of God if
[57:08] you're inviting people to to go fact
[57:10] check
[57:11] you you better have confidence in what
[57:13] you're saying cuz they they might go do
[57:16] it
[57:18] amen compare this 20th century Church to
[57:22] the first century Church go ahead do
[57:24] that where is the power
[57:27] where is the love where is the purified
[57:30] church that with stod sin and walked
[57:33] with faith toward Jesus where is the
[57:35] unity you can't find it that's a fair
[57:39] statement because now we're not talking
[57:41] about the bride the bride goes into a
[57:43] Rapture the church goes through the
[57:44] tribulation remember the bride was a
[57:46] church called out of a church like
[57:48] Israel was called out of Egypt see in
[57:50] The Exodus so Revelation 18:4 the
[57:53] message of this hour the message of this
[57:55] messenger of this day was come out of
[57:57] her my people come out of that systems
[58:00] of man come out of those denominational
[58:02] Creeds they're they're just barnyards
[58:05] you're an eagle you're not a chicken
[58:07] pecking around in the manure piles
[58:09] you're an eagle meant to soar in the
[58:11] heavenlies up where the voice of God can
[58:13] speak
[58:16] see so we find then that he he says you
[58:20] know where if you've got the power of
[58:22] God then where's where's the purified
[58:24] church amen because the the book of Acts
[58:27] church was a purified Church they lived
[58:30] righteous in Holiness and they practiced
[58:32] it
[58:33] see so so he says if this church has all
[58:38] it needs now this Fallen church this
[58:39] lean church if this church has all it
[58:42] all it needs why were they crying out
[58:45] for more of God in the book of Acts as
[58:47] though they didn't have it at all and
[58:49] yet they had far more than they have
[58:51] today and of course his reference is
[58:53] right there to Acts chapter 4
[58:56] I mean they had already had the Holy
[58:57] Ghost poured out in Acts chapter 2 but
[59:00] now they're in Acts chapter 4 crying out
[59:01] for more almost like they don't even got
[59:03] it saying Lord come and do these Great
[59:06] Signs by thy by the name of thy holy
[59:08] Child Jesus and heal the sick and move
[59:10] and raise the dead and move Among Us and
[59:12] the Bible says and the the the rushing
[59:14] wind and the building Shook and it all
[59:16] verse chapter two happened all over
[59:18] again he came in like a right a mighty
[59:20] went and filled all the house and they
[59:22] began to speak with tongues and move
[59:23] under the power of God it just goes to
[59:26] show that that early church was never
[59:29] satisfied they always wanted more of God
[59:31] and more of God and more of God and I
[59:34] want you to not be satisfied with last
[59:36] week's anointing say Lord I need a fresh
[59:38] anointing today I got to face a fresh
[59:41] Devils with fresh ideas and and I'm
[59:44] going to need the fresh presence of the
[59:46] holy spirit in my life so you never sto
[59:49] going
[59:50] forward
[59:52] see so he comes back now to the second
[59:55] half

[1:07:11] have much further I want to go
[1:07:15] uh I'm going to make a few comments here
[1:07:17] and we'll catch just maybe two more
[1:07:20] slide two or three more slides and
[1:07:22] that'll be enough for
[1:07:23] today but what what a model that we read
[1:07:28] Amen in these
[1:07:30] verses you know H as Believers today who
[1:07:34] say you know that we want to see more of
[1:07:38] the return to the original Pentecost we
[1:07:41] want that same God what does that mean
[1:07:42] brother Jason it means that we want that
[1:07:44] same God moving over
[1:07:47] us I want the same kind of
[1:07:50] Victory I want the same kind of
[1:07:52] overcoming power and I want it daily
[1:07:56] I don't just want it on Sundays and
[1:07:58] Wednesdays I want it daily I want to see
[1:08:01] the devil put under my feet daily and
[1:08:05] fact is I want to see it hourly because
[1:08:07] I recognize my hour I'm recognizing the
[1:08:11] hour that I have arrived at in the in
[1:08:13] the prophecy oh Hallelujah friends the
[1:08:16] same Holy Ghost operation of the gifts
[1:08:19] of the Spirit the same holy ghost that
[1:08:22] that caused everything to to operate in
[1:08:24] perfect spirit spiritual order and I and
[1:08:26] I want the same Zeal to worship God in
[1:08:30] spirit and in truth say do you do you
[1:08:32] want us to be emotional I want you to
[1:08:34] have the Zeal of the spirit and however
[1:08:37] however that affect you If It Makes You
[1:08:39] Weep and cry if it makes you fall on
[1:08:42] your face if it makes you like me jump
[1:08:44] up and down sometimes I can't help it I
[1:08:47] just start jumping up and down why cuz I
[1:08:50] I want to jump out of my own body I want
[1:08:52] to jump into another
[1:08:54] realm Hallelujah Hallelujah it requires
[1:08:57] if we want all of those things do
[1:09:00] we do
[1:09:02] we Hallelujah
[1:09:05] am then it requires the same kind of
[1:09:09] dedication that they had that they had
[1:09:13] it requires the same kind of sincerity
[1:09:15] that we see in these verses that we
[1:09:18] read finally brother brandham says here
[1:09:20] in trying to do God a service without it
[1:09:23] being his will
[1:09:26] it's a wheat now but we're plenty green
[1:09:29] uhhuh that's right have to lay in the
[1:09:32] presence of the sun to be mellowed up
[1:09:35] that's all of it plenty green we haven't
[1:09:38] got the sincerity the sacredness the
[1:09:41] thing we ought to have in our midst to
[1:09:43] know what the spirit of the Living God
[1:09:46] moving among moving in his word and
[1:09:49] showing us the things yet so this this
[1:09:53] is where brother brandham this is what
[1:09:56] he mean he
[1:09:58] meant this is this is what laying in the
[1:10:01] presence of the son is all
[1:10:06] about see he goes
[1:10:10] on
[1:10:11] God at this little altar of every heart
[1:10:15] present here and around the nation I
[1:10:16] think he's in a prayer
[1:10:18] here may The Waters from under the altar
[1:10:21] of God gush out this morning upon your
[1:10:23] church and water it Lord for the seasons
[1:10:26] just about finished give it life the
[1:10:27] Waters of life that it might be also to
[1:10:31] lay in the presence of the sun to be
[1:10:33] ripened for your
[1:10:41] Garner so
[1:10:44] it's it's more than a
[1:10:48] cliche lay in the presence of the Sun
[1:10:51] what does that even mean that sounds
[1:10:52] like a cliche it's far more than a
[1:10:54] cliche
[1:10:56] it's not a play on
[1:10:57] words from a
[1:11:00] prophet it's not just some you know
[1:11:03] something we say to people
[1:11:05] and send them on their way go lay in the
[1:11:08] presence of the Sun be a good little boy
[1:11:10] good little girl go lay in the presence
[1:11:12] oh I got all these problems brother
[1:11:13] Jason just go lay in the presence of the
[1:11:14] son oh what does that even
[1:11:19] mean it's about sincerity before God
[1:11:22] it's about dedication before God it's
[1:11:25] about having the right desire and the
[1:11:27] right mental attitude toward his word
[1:11:29] it's about not getting
[1:11:31] distracted it's about consecrating your
[1:11:34] mind it's about taking the time to love
[1:11:37] on him so that he will love on
[1:11:41] you it's something that can be activated
[1:11:44] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:11:45] this isn't Hocus Pocus this isn't Magic
[1:11:49] this is the power of the word there this
[1:11:52] can be activated in you say how because
[1:11:56] you got a gene of God in you and and
[1:11:59] when the Holy Spirit comes on that when
[1:12:00] you present yourself as a as a as a
[1:12:03] living
[1:12:04] Tabernacle and you're willing to do what
[1:12:07] it takes to add to your faith virtue and
[1:12:09] to Virtue knowledge and knowledge and go
[1:12:10] on all the way up the scale and you're
[1:12:13] willing to allow dedication and
[1:12:14] sincerity in your life and you're
[1:12:16] willing to lay aside the weights and
[1:12:19] sins that does so easily beset you or
[1:12:23] distract you and you're willing to
[1:12:25] run this race see when people come
[1:12:31] together to hear the word of God there
[1:12:33] ought to be an expectation that the
[1:12:35] waters from under the throne are going
[1:12:37] to flow down through here brother
[1:12:39] brandom talked about I think it was
[1:12:40] sister sheffy had that dream and brother
[1:12:43] she had a dream and how that the the the
[1:12:45] mountain and all down through the waters
[1:12:47] were just running down through the
[1:12:48] channels all the way down and that's
[1:12:50] that's the life the the Capstone is in
[1:12:52] the top of the mountain and there's
[1:12:54] where the water gush out from under his
[1:12:56] throne he's he's
[1:12:57] enthroned above the bride and all the
[1:13:00] brother B said those Waters moving down
[1:13:02] through the channels just running out
[1:13:04] everywhere and say Lord let them just
[1:13:05] run down let it saturate me let my whole
[1:13:08] life be a conduit of the waters that
[1:13:11] come out from under the Throne of God
[1:13:13] washing our minds clean flooding down
[1:13:16] with his presence filling our hearts
[1:13:18] with the presence of the Son of God
[1:13:20] sunlight so in light to do what ripen
[1:13:24] the gene of God oh you'll never get it
[1:13:26] with dry
[1:13:27] intellectualism you'll never get it with
[1:13:30] worked up emotionalism but it's real and
[1:13:33] it's to be had and you can have it right
[1:13:36] now for all those who wanted to say Lord
[1:13:39] God flood down over my life let the
[1:13:43] waters from under the throne move down
[1:13:46] and saturate stand up with me friends

[1:13:52] waters from under your throne
[1:13:55] may they just flow down through my life

[1:17:14] judgments started with the first
[1:17:17] woe that was the the pre-tribulation

[1:17:22] fulfillment of those vials and it's
[1:17:25] already started in this day and and and
