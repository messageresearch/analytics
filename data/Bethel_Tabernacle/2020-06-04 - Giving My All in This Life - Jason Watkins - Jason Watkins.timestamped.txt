[35:39] 18 greet you in the name of Lord happy
[35:42] to have you out on a Wednesday night
[35:43] amen praise the Lord want to look this
[35:56] evening at a title that I've just kind
[36:01] of struggled with a little bit but I
[36:05] finally sent a title back to the booth
[36:09] for this evening giving my all in this
[36:14] life how many want to give your all in
[36:18] this life I taste something friends
[36:20] they're the promise of the Lord is so
[36:23] overwhelming to those who are willing to
[36:26] give their all no matter how hard the
[36:30] job is here as I'm so fond of saying the
[36:33] retirement is out of this world a man
[36:38] praise the Lord
[36:40] god bless you let's read from Luke
[36:42] chapter 18 and we'll read verses 18
[36:47] through 30 and a certain ruler asked him
[36:52] saying good master what shall I do to
[36:55] inherit eternal life jesus said unto him
[36:58] why call us thou me good nun is good
[37:02] save one that is God thou knowest the
[37:05] commandments do not commit adultery do
[37:08] not kill do not steal do not bear false
[37:10] witness honor thy father and thy mother
[37:13] and he said all these have I kept from
[37:16] my youth up now when Jesus heard these
[37:20] things he said unto Him yet lack of sow
[37:23] one thing sell all that thou hast and
[37:28] distribute unto the poor and thou shalt
[37:31] have treasure in heaven and
[37:34] come follow me and when he heard this
[37:37] known to catch it when he heard this he
[37:41] was very sorrowful for he was very rich
[37:44] and when Jesus saw that he was very
[37:49] sorrowful he said how hardly shall they
[37:54] that have riches enter into the kingdom
[37:57] of God for it is easier for a camel to
[38:00] go through a needles eye than for a rich
[38:03] man to enter into the kingdom of God and
[38:05] they that heard it said who then can be
[38:09] saved and he said the things which are
[38:13] impossible with men are possible with
[38:16] God a man to them then Peter said lo we
[38:21] have left all and followed thee and he
[38:25] said unto Him verily I say unto you
[38:28] there is no man that hath left house
[38:30] parents brethren wife or children for
[38:33] the kingdom of God's sake who shall not
[38:36] receive a manifold more in this present
[38:41] time and in the world to come life
[38:44] everlasting
[38:45] water promise amen let's pray master we
[38:50] thank you for your word tonight and I
[38:53] pray now Lord as I just surrender myself
[38:56] Lord into your care I have outlines and
[39:01] notes before me and I've just seemingly
[39:04] Lord just went over them and over them
[39:08] and moving things and changing things
[39:10] and it just seems like that I'm just
[39:12] gonna have to stand here and just let
[39:14] you decide what all you want to preach
[39:16] so father I'm just humbling myself now
[39:19] before you I've did my own lord humbling
[39:23] before I came out and and I want to
[39:26] stand here as a clean vessel I want to
[39:29] speak to people who desire also as do I
[39:32] to have clean hearts clean hands clean
[39:34] minds granite Lord we want to be
[39:37] pleasing to you in this life you gave us
[39:42] this life it is you that owns it you
[39:45] have given us eternal life
[39:47] Lord we gladly surrender this little
[39:51] short temporal vapor trail into your
[39:55] care now I completely give it to you the
[39:59] audience here present the audience
[40:01] listening across the airwaves we commit
[40:03] it to you in Jesus name Amen god bless
[40:06] you as you're seated we have a number of
[40:17] requests that I will get to here shortly
[40:22] and I'll just watch to see if any more
[40:33] come in before we go to prayer and we'll
[40:37] catch those as well amen
[40:41] an interesting story the rich young
[40:44] ruler as we would refer to him very
[40:47] often times gee brother branham spoke
[40:50] about him quite a bit and in fact is you
[40:54] know the very last text sermon that
[40:58] brother Branham ever took was leadership
[41:00] in Covina California now he preached a
[41:02] communion and foot washing service back
[41:05] in Tucson but I'm talking about as as as
[41:08] a full text sermon he just passed a few
[41:11] comments and they went right into the
[41:13] communion some of the most wonderful
[41:14] comments we have in the message amen
[41:17] where he said I found out I there was a
[41:19] there was another William Branham down
[41:21] inside who wasn't the son of Charles and
[41:23] Ella Branham Wow what a what a what a
[41:27] parting shot that he gave to the bride
[41:30] knowing she would have to face the devil
[41:32] and go on without him but in his last
[41:35] sermon in Covina and he takes leadership
[41:38] and you know he he contrasts multiple
[41:44] figures in the scripture and you know he
[41:48] talks about Moses and he talks about
[41:50] this rich young ruler and what a
[41:52] contrast between those two rich young
[41:56] ruler Moses was a rich young ruler what
[42:00] a different
[42:01] choice Moses made and we want to talk
[42:05] tonight minister from my heart quite a
[42:09] bit on choice and the choices that we
[42:13] make
[42:13] it's sad that this young man made the
[42:17] choice that he did it actually was sad
[42:19] for Jesus interestingly Jesus loved him
[42:22] as him as a human being and you know God
[42:26] God loves sinners Jesus was a friend to
[42:30] sinners he tried his best to win every
[42:33] sinner he ever came in contact with and
[42:35] I think that it is it should be an
[42:37] abject lesson to us you know our
[42:40] attitude toward the unbelieving world
[42:42] brother Branham talked about you know
[42:45] even the man who's a drunkard or you
[42:49] know his alcohol or his cigarettes or
[42:51] things like that and I don't have the
[42:53] quote in front of me so I'm not quoting
[42:54] it verbatim but brother Branham teaches
[42:57] us from there to to the effect that you
[43:00] know don't tom don't don't don't take
[43:03] that from him that's the only the only
[43:06] happiness he has even though it's a
[43:08] false Mirage of happiness it's the only
[43:11] you know he said rather than you know
[43:13] try to do it that way why don't you show
[43:15] him something better I you know I always
[43:18] used to observe in in observing you know
[43:21] and raising small children and you know
[43:24] I learned I learned pretty quick that if
[43:27] you want to take you know one of moms
[43:30] pretties away from a little little one
[43:33] and a half-year-old you you go get a toy
[43:36] and you go thank you here because if you
[43:41] just take it from him he's not gonna
[43:43] understand and he's gonna scream you
[43:45] can't explain it so what you do is just
[43:48] giving something he would rather have
[43:50] amen and you know I I think that Jesus
[43:54] you know used a lot of wisdom in the way
[43:56] that he handled the sinner and you know
[44:00] he used a lot of wisdom in the way he
[44:02] handled obstinate people Zacchaeus was
[44:05] very obstinate and Jesus just handled
[44:08] him perfectly and you know the way that
[44:10] he sat among publicans and won many of
[44:14] them and
[44:14] you know he won a lot more people to
[44:16] Jehovah than the Pharisees did and and
[44:20] so you know there's there's something to
[44:22] be said about our approach and you know
[44:25] Jesus him seems to employ here all the
[44:30] tools that were given to him he was kind
[44:34] he answered his question he took him to
[44:37] the word he loved him he tried to help
[44:40] him he Jesus could see that he had a
[44:43] very deep-rooted problem thank you sir
[44:45] he had a very deep-rooted problem of
[44:47] selfishness and he was quite
[44:50] self-centered and that was really his
[44:52] issue I have noted numerous times
[44:55] brother Jack in the scripture that when
[44:57] Zacchaeus come down and he had he was
[44:59] kind of like Matthew he worked for the
[45:01] government he was doing some tax tax
[45:03] collecting things and he was cheating
[45:05] cheating his hebrew brethren and you
[45:08] know he wasn't being honest and and so
[45:11] when he comes down out of the training
[45:12] he's ready to become a believer and he
[45:15] he stands up and makes a proclamation to
[45:18] the people whomever I have wronged and
[45:21] he went back to the law of Moses I will
[45:23] refund you four times what I took and
[45:25] you know what Jesus said that's enough
[45:28] that's good that's all you need let's go
[45:31] going to your house for supper yeah and
[45:33] and and that's all Jesus required Jesus
[45:36] knew that's really all it would take but
[45:39] when he comes to this rich young ruler
[45:41] you know Jesus understands your heart
[45:44] Wow
[45:45] do you need to really get a hold of that
[45:47] tonight now that's that's good and good
[45:51] and while it's good and good her it's
[45:54] it's good because that when you fail him
[45:57] he knows your heart that you really
[45:59] didn't want to fail him he knows your
[46:02] heart that you really do love for the
[46:03] word even if you stumble you can say to
[46:06] him Lord you know in my heart I love you
[46:10] and the good news is he does and the
[46:13] good news is is that when you're a child
[46:16] of God you can't hide from him and he
[46:21] won't let you hide from him
[46:24] he will come after you and after you you
[46:27] have to understand that you're here
[46:30] against a backdrop of election and he
[46:33] can't lose you and so he you're a twin
[46:37] he's on your case I remember you know
[46:40] I've said this before quoting um sadder
[46:43] than that and says Louis just writes him
[46:45] back and says my friend says the Holy
[46:47] Ghost is chasing you and I do not think
[46:49] you'll get away I'm glad I didn't get
[46:54] away I'm glad he chased me down and
[46:58] knocked me down and held me down until I
[47:00] said Amen oh my
[47:03] Amen my mama you know my mind my brother
[47:07] I haven't I don't know where this came
[47:09] from when he was a little kid he come up
[47:10] with the word cat fro I don't know what
[47:12] it means to this day is it is an archaic
[47:15] word uh I study language but whenever
[47:19] you'd get him on the ground and having
[47:20] pin he would say CAF row and that was my
[47:22] signal to let go
[47:23] he had surrendered and I am so big and
[47:26] then worked with my dad when my dad
[47:28] would have him down tickling him he he
[47:30] would he would scream calf row and my
[47:32] dad would just keep right on going
[47:34] and he would he would send a bugle call
[47:37] you know for me like like the cavalry to
[47:40] come and I wasn't about to go in there
[47:42] I'm like oh no oh my the memories that
[47:48] come up at the oddest times but you know
[47:51] I'm glad that I surrendered to the Lord
[47:53] and you know it's sad this is that story
[47:57] that we read in Luke 18 because this
[47:59] young man didn't and you know Jesus knew
[48:02] in his heart that he had a much more
[48:05] gripping problem than Zacchaeus had he
[48:08] knew that this man had a problem of
[48:11] self-centeredness that was so strong
[48:14] that it was such a spirit of selfishness
[48:18] that he wanted his cake and eat it too
[48:20] he wanted what he wanted and he just
[48:23] wanted it and even though Jesus loved
[48:26] even gave him the words of life and gave
[48:28] him an opportunity the Bible goes on to
[48:31] tell at some time later in hell he
[48:35] lifted up his eyes
[48:37] to me the saddest stories are the ones
[48:40] that end tragic that need not have been
[48:42] I would listen life's already full of
[48:45] enough tragedy you're not going to avoid
[48:47] you can't because you're gonna need to
[48:49] struggle sometimes but when it's
[48:51] needless tragedy when it's needless
[48:53] struggle my and III certainly have to
[48:57] say a man with all of you tonight I have
[49:00] I have struggled needlessly before
[49:02] rather than just doing it God's Way so
[49:07] we learn
[49:07] thank God we learn as children and and
[49:11] so you know he he made that fateful
[49:15] decision to to maintain his own way and
[49:20] to maintain what it was he wanted to
[49:22] have and to hold in life and he today
[49:26] he's living with that decision now I
[49:30] know you're reading a story that's 2,000
[49:33] years old I'm here to tell you that man
[49:34] still alive and he still got just as
[49:37] much or more regret today as he did when
[49:40] he first lifted up his eyes in hell you
[49:46] know when you think about life you know
[49:50] what does life present to a man I was
[49:58] born in the world people commonly call
[50:00] it a journey of life I've spoke on that
[50:04] you know took a whole series on it
[50:06] recently about a journey and but you
[50:08] know it's commonly called the journey of
[50:11] life and you know as a as a minister and
[50:16] particularly as a pastor paying
[50:18] appointed of the Lord to be a guide you
[50:23] know to my fellow man and I would have
[50:25] never done it
[50:26] had he not called me to it but often in
[50:31] my observations of people I come away
[50:34] wondering if a sense of journey really
[50:38] stands out to them that they really get
[50:41] it that they're on a journey that life's
[50:45] not just happening it's not it's not
[50:48] purposeless and casual
[50:50] that's what the devil would like you to
[50:52] believe but it's anything but you know
[50:56] and I I as I said i i i i recently
[51:01] ministered on it on on it in a lengthy
[51:04] series on our journey and i I must say
[51:07] that I continue to feel an urgency in my
[51:11] heart to cry out a warning still even
[51:15] after taking it as a series and I I've
[51:17] been this sermon that I'm preaching
[51:19] tonight as I said I've struggled with
[51:20] the title I was gonna call it being
[51:22] human I was gonna call it this great
[51:24] struggle I was gonna call I didn't know
[51:25] what to call it but but but but I you
[51:29] know perhaps that that there's this
[51:31] urgency in my heart and we see the
[51:35] things that are happening in the world
[51:37] today and you know perhaps it's because
[51:41] that journeying Humanity is nearing the
[51:48] final end of all journeys of all
[51:51] journeys think of it friends all
[51:52] journeys are coming to an end of all the
[51:55] journeys that have ever been in the
[51:58] earth above a man or a woman who lived
[52:00] how what number would you put on it I
[52:02] wouldn't even know where to start how
[52:04] many zeros you'd have to put on how many
[52:06] human experiences as a journey men and
[52:10] women boys and girls have went and some
[52:13] were shortened some were lengthy and
[52:17] some are good some are bad some are
[52:18] happy some were sad I mean you know of
[52:21] every kind but to think that here we are
[52:24] at a time when all journeys of all
[52:30] humanity are coming to their end and
[52:34] soon I believe it is soon the final stop
[52:40] as it were on this long road back to
[52:45] redemption a 6,000 year pilgrimage of
[52:51] humanity 6,000 years he's been on a
[52:56] pilgrimage and finally as a specie the
[53:01] end is in sight
[53:04] and full redemption of God's plan that
[53:08] he's been working on for six millennia
[53:12] that's a long time it's coming to a
[53:16] climax not when you expect it not when
[53:22] you want it but you know when it's going
[53:24] to happen when it's time when it's when
[53:29] it's time is up you say brother Jason
[53:32] how can you know when that time is what
[53:37] you really can't you really can't know
[53:40] when that time is but you can prepare
[53:43] because you know it's coming I mean
[53:46] whether or not say well I don't know
[53:48] when the window the the I don't know
[53:51] when they're catching away the body
[53:53] changed the rapture the church I don't
[53:55] know when that's gonna happen who said
[53:56] you're gonna make it that long well said
[54:00] well I'm I'm young you might not make it
[54:02] home tonight brother branham centers Ben
[54:06] Ben Ben Ben many a 16 year old you know
[54:10] who never made it you know and and so
[54:14] never never made it back home and and
[54:17] and we can prepare because we do know
[54:21] it's coming there are certain signs now
[54:23] we can do that there are certain signs
[54:26] that we've looked for and we've looked
[54:29] for you know for what we think really is
[54:32] a long time it's really not been a long
[54:34] time but but but it has been
[54:37] sufficiently long that the Bible
[54:42] prophesied the Spirit of Christ upon
[54:45] Simon Peter prophesied expressly that in
[54:49] the last days scoffers walking after
[54:52] their own lust would come him among the
[54:55] world they would start to move
[54:56] throughout the world and say where is
[54:59] the promise of his coming for since the
[55:02] father's fell asleep all things continue
[55:04] as they were from the beginning of the
[55:06] creation but one thing is very different
[55:10] and the signs that we're seeing today
[55:15] one thing is very different indeed in
[55:20] that this is the first time where all of
[55:26] the in time signs in the Bible are all
[55:32] happening at once all of them they're
[55:39] all happening at once Jesus
[55:43] you know piecemeal almost it'll be wars
[55:46] and rumors of wars and there'll be
[55:48] earthquakes in diverse places and we've
[55:49] had all of these things and you know but
[55:52] but now you see all of the signs of the
[55:56] scripture and that makes it a unique our
[55:59] friends you know let us let us not be
[56:03] you know the these signs that we see are
[56:06] are unfolding all together and and and
[56:10] if at the very least they're they're a
[56:12] harbinger that are telling you know that
[56:15] I'm telling you they're urging you to
[56:17] prepare get ready because something's
[56:21] happening the world right now and
[56:23] everybody all from the from the top of
[56:26] the political chain all the way down
[56:29] social media news media everybody
[56:32] constantly dropping the word
[56:34] unparalleled unprecedented unprecedented
[56:37] unparalleled never before in history you
[56:43] cannot look out on the world right now
[56:45] I remember when covin nineteen began
[56:49] nearly what eight ten weeks ago and I I
[56:52] stood right here in this pulpit and I
[56:54] said look it doesn't even matter you
[56:56] know
[56:56] because and that one brother wrote that
[56:58] wonderful piece about wave after wave
[57:00] watch this is just a dress rehearsal
[57:02] what are they gonna do when wave after
[57:04] wave is coming and I said listen
[57:06] understand this here you got a comb and
[57:09] you got a nice a global pandemic
[57:10] I understand behind this when there's
[57:12] five coming behind those five there's
[57:14] five more and now here we are we can't
[57:17] even get out of a global pandemic and
[57:19] our nation
[57:20] nation is in such turmoil and there is
[57:26] no way to fix it because you're dealing
[57:29] with unregenerate men who won't take
[57:32] what a brilliant master builder Christ
[57:37] must be think about the the level of the
[57:41] mind that it would take to create a
[57:44] millennial world with a government and
[57:46] set in walls and regulations for
[57:49] functioning that literally completely
[57:53] treat everybody with equality and
[57:56] justice for all and completely
[57:59] eliminates conflict completely runs
[58:04] perfectly in harmony and the world will
[58:07] be filled during the Millennium with
[58:09] untold numbers of people that besides
[58:12] the bride there be heathens down through
[58:15] ages raised up to hear the gospel please
[58:17] we don't know what it's all gonna be
[58:19] there brother branham only gives us
[58:20] little tidbits
[58:21] it's a honeymoon you're not supposed to
[58:23] know all the secrets but but think of
[58:27] the of the level of mind you would have
[58:29] to have think of how brilliant Jesus
[58:32] must be and then we struggle to let him
[58:36] make our decisions we struggle to let
[58:40] him tell us what to do a mine so
[58:44] brilliant he's going to pull off
[58:46] something that mankind in 6,000 years
[58:48] with every kind of government imaginable
[58:49] has tried and failed they are urging you
[58:55] these signs that are all happening
[58:58] together are urging you to prepare for a
[59:01] change because you are indeed very much
[59:04] on a pilgrimage much like much like
[59:07] Christian in the pilgrims progress same
[59:11] as him you you you stand at the at the
[59:14] trailhead that leads to celestial City
[59:17] and very much like Christian you you
[59:21] look down the trail and you you see many
[59:23] pathways and you must choose the right
[59:26] one you're not left you know to your own
[59:32] wits thankfully your sir
[59:34] applied with detailed instruction and
[59:36] much encouragement from evangelist
[59:38] evangelist I love evangelists in those
[59:40] stories with my favorite characters cuz
[59:42] he just comes out of nowhere with the
[59:44] answer and here they are in an
[59:46] impossible situation let me take some
[59:49] friends I love that God has evangelist
[59:51] in his fivefold ministry who can come in
[59:53] and where we got up situation and
[59:55] sometimes even as a pastor I can know
[59:57] something's wrong I can't I can't sniff
[59:59] that out I need I need a bloodhound
[1:00:01] I need evangelist to come in and I'll
[1:00:03] sit back and watch and you might not
[1:00:05] even know it and he might not even know
[1:00:06] it I'm sitting back taking notes waiting
[1:00:08] to figure out where supports the problem
[1:00:10] and that evangelist will go right to it
[1:00:13] and I'll go hmm okay got it
[1:00:17] you know it's it's amazing to me that
[1:00:21] God gives you know Christians in our
[1:00:27] pilgrimage with all of these choices and
[1:00:30] all of these wrong paths and only one
[1:00:32] right path and then God supplies you
[1:00:36] with ministry and pastors and prophets
[1:00:38] and apostles and evangelists and
[1:00:40] teachers and so often times we don't
[1:00:43] even avail ourselves of them we come to
[1:00:49] church when it's convenient when it
[1:00:51] works out good and I think I can get
[1:00:53] there we we we pull our preachers for
[1:00:56] their opinion so we can think about it
[1:00:58] and you know and and right you can give
[1:01:01] it right out of the Word of God and that
[1:01:03] sometimes I can give something so direct
[1:01:05] out of the Word of God and I can see the
[1:01:07] person trying to decide Wow and I use it
[1:01:16] only saying another thing I've learned
[1:01:19] over 25 years doesn't do me any good
[1:01:21] I can I can lead a horse to water I can
[1:01:25] do that but I cannot make a horse drink
[1:01:28] it drink it or he won't you won't make
[1:01:33] him
[1:01:37] which path will you take you warned in
[1:01:43] plain language the consequences of going
[1:01:45] off the correct path so which path we
[1:01:47] take which path will you decide you're
[1:01:49] on a pilgrimage you're on a trail that
[1:01:52] heads to celestial City which path
[1:01:55] you're gonna take you've been given the
[1:01:56] word on which path but which one are you
[1:01:58] gonna choose just cause the word says
[1:02:00] it'll mean you're gonna do it
[1:02:03] what will you decide or you know as as
[1:02:07] men mankind always seems to want to know
[1:02:10] what are the stakes well what were the
[1:02:13] stakes for Christian and pilgrims
[1:02:14] progress only his life no big deal only
[1:02:18] his life that was the stakes wrong
[1:02:22] decisions could could make his journey a
[1:02:25] very short one ending in tragedy and you
[1:02:28] know I would say to you all you're on
[1:02:30] this path were on this pathway now and
[1:02:32] even if and I've seen people do this and
[1:02:35] but I've also seen it come to its to its
[1:02:37] end like Solomon said it would and even
[1:02:40] if you're any ball to skirt the edge and
[1:02:44] cheat death and cheat calamity your
[1:02:48] whole life you know at best it'll be a
[1:02:51] life with ups and downs and you'll be
[1:02:55] dogged by uncertainty you'll always be
[1:02:59] crashing and trying to pick yourself up
[1:03:03] friends Oh God has given us a way a path
[1:03:08] an understanding of what these signs
[1:03:12] mean of what the time of the hour is and
[1:03:14] we ought to be preparing ourselves I
[1:03:17] feel an urgency to say we're not quite
[1:03:19] prepared as we think we are and we need
[1:03:22] to be prepared more I feel it I feel it
[1:03:24] for me I feel it for you you can either
[1:03:29] think I'm right or wrong on that but I'm
[1:03:32] positive I'm right what are the odds
[1:03:36] preacher what are the stakes what are
[1:03:39] the odds mankind always an odds maker
[1:03:45] always weighing chance against skill
[1:03:48] either folding or doubling down on his
[1:03:51] stubbornness on his decisions always
[1:03:54] figuring always calculating always
[1:03:56] scheming to beat the odds surprisingly
[1:03:59] surprisingly enough men come to the end
[1:04:04] and and and they discover that the odds
[1:04:07] were always a hundred percent and life
[1:04:12] wasn't a game like satan had him
[1:04:16] thinking it was choose the path that God
[1:04:21] freely offers to show you you gain
[1:04:24] eternal life choose the contrasting path
[1:04:28] you miss the grandest payoff imaginable
[1:04:31] all with absolute certainty 100% you're
[1:04:41] born with a fallen mind that's what the
[1:04:45] Bible teaches us you're not even
[1:04:48] qualified
[1:04:49] that's why Jeremiah would say it is not
[1:04:52] in a man to discover his own way he's
[1:04:55] got to have a guide because you're born
[1:04:59] with a fallen mind and you're completely
[1:05:01] unqualified to find your way home your
[1:05:05] mind is enmity against God it can never
[1:05:08] the Bible teaches that it can never
[1:05:09] agree with God's Word you're not going
[1:05:12] to outsmart him you'll have to surrender
[1:05:17] to his lordship over your life you know
[1:05:25] people when we talk about people who
[1:05:30] believe a lie and are damned by it
[1:05:33] that's a prophecy of the end time people
[1:05:36] that's a prophecy of the overwhelming
[1:05:38] majority of humanity at the end time
[1:05:41] that they will believe a lie and be
[1:05:43] damned by it so I mean it's going to
[1:05:47] take almost everybody it would even take
[1:05:50] it's so strong it would even take the
[1:05:53] elective if that were possible that's
[1:05:55] how strong it is only election keeps it
[1:05:58] from from taking you
[1:06:00] see but we find that that it's it's not
[1:06:05] people you know people don't just let me
[1:06:08] make this real clear
[1:06:10] people don't just believe false things
[1:06:13] and are damned by that that that's not
[1:06:18] the kind of God we serve in Jesus you
[1:06:22] know Jesus wasn't even like that when he
[1:06:24] was here it wasn't you you can't
[1:06:27] disbelieve what you don't know and since
[1:06:30] sin is unbelief you understand then then
[1:06:33] then it's not it's not believing false
[1:06:36] things that that are the damnation of
[1:06:40] people but when you read the life story
[1:06:44] and the teachings of Jesus you find that
[1:06:47] the lie that damns souls is that they
[1:06:52] make a willful choice to believe false
[1:06:56] things about the truth
[1:07:00] that God reveals his truth unmistakeably
[1:07:06] and he has and people make a choice to
[1:07:10] reject that they cannot deny its
[1:07:13] validity not in the Bible anyway and you
[1:07:17] know they they they they you know they
[1:07:19] they pass on and propagate distortions
[1:07:22] of falsehood about the truth they're
[1:07:26] like they're like experts of the law in
[1:07:30] the Old Testament though the King James
[1:07:32] Bible called them lawyers because they
[1:07:34] were experts in the law there were
[1:07:36] scholars theologians of the law
[1:07:39] and Jesus said woe unto you because you
[1:07:44] stand at the door of knowledge you
[1:07:46] yourself won't go in and you hinder
[1:07:49] those who would go in and we find that
[1:07:54] they pass in this age they they pass on
[1:07:58] and they propagate distortions and
[1:08:00] falsehood and you know and and and and
[1:08:03] oh my you should see them when they when
[1:08:05] they get among their base and they you
[1:08:08] know they they it works great at their
[1:08:11] pep rallies those things they call
[1:08:13] church services
[1:08:15] not church services they're just pep
[1:08:17] rallies a pet we've got a pep rally
[1:08:20] going with their base and and and and
[1:08:23] and and it rallies them oh my they they
[1:08:26] they get on there and they they freely
[1:08:28] you know say intentional I just heard a
[1:08:33] preacher recently who was a former
[1:08:35] wonderful minister in this message and
[1:08:38] now is on the internet did you know
[1:08:40] talking about this is false and that's
[1:08:42] what I'm saying my goodness you actually
[1:08:46] no way in Brenham didn't teach that you
[1:08:49] actually know that that makes you the
[1:08:51] worst kind of a hypocrite you're a snake
[1:08:54] you're not you're not worthy of living
[1:08:57] because you're you're saying that to an
[1:09:00] unknowing world who don't know what he
[1:09:03] taught and you know he didn't teach that
[1:09:06] but you're propagating that he did and
[1:09:09] you're saying oh we gotta be against it
[1:09:11] now and you're you're you're not against
[1:09:14] what he actually taught you you you
[1:09:16] can't disprove what he taught not buy
[1:09:18] your Bible
[1:09:19] oh my rallying sure rallying yes
[1:09:24] rallying sure reality no no claim they
[1:09:32] they've been around the world all it
[1:09:34] does is rally a false faith friends you
[1:09:38] know you can work up a human faith in an
[1:09:40] emotion and think it's true and be
[1:09:41] completely deceived by it and claim
[1:09:45] they've been around the world and you
[1:09:48] know and they they saw problems in the
[1:09:50] message in this country and in this
[1:09:51] country and in this country and the
[1:09:52] problems here and problem there and
[1:09:54] differences here and difference there an
[1:09:55] argue here and argue I'm going hold on
[1:09:59] excuse me excuse me I've been around the
[1:10:03] world - where were you going you weren't
[1:10:06] going to the churches I was going to
[1:10:08] I've been on their own six continents
[1:10:10] preaching this message for almost thirty
[1:10:13] years you weren't going to the churches
[1:10:15] I was going to cuz the churches I was at
[1:10:17] in Germany and in Africa and Asia
[1:10:20] and in the islands and all over the all
[1:10:22] over the world throughout Europe I'm
[1:10:23] gonna tell you I found people who were
[1:10:25] had the power God who had holiness in
[1:10:28] their lives who had the Holy Ghost and
[1:10:30] fire burning who all were unified
[1:10:34] agreement of amen to every word of God
[1:10:38] it's all it's all an intentional
[1:10:42] misrepresentation I don't even I don't
[1:10:48] even recognize the message they describe
[1:10:50] so vulgar ly to an unknowing world the
[1:10:53] ministry brothers you know the ministry
[1:10:56] brothers working here with me brother
[1:10:58] Matt and brother Jason that that's one
[1:11:00] of the reasons we're we're exploding on
[1:11:02] the on the scene with our podcasts we've
[1:11:05] been purchasing equipment and getting
[1:11:06] trying to get a studio built we're
[1:11:08] trying to get out there and set the
[1:11:10] record straight set the record straight
[1:11:13] I'm tired of the misrepresentation I
[1:11:15] have no argument with them
[1:11:17] I'm commanded in the Bible not argue
[1:11:19] with them at all
[1:11:20] that's not how you handle gainsayers you
[1:11:22] know how the book you know how Paul told
[1:11:24] Titus to handle gainsayers preach the
[1:11:26] word just preach the word and that'll
[1:11:29] silence the game-saver hallelujah oh my
[1:11:36] they know they read the same Bibles that
[1:11:40] I do they show themselves to be complete
[1:11:43] hypocrites they know the teachings and
[1:11:47] doctrines of this message are squarely
[1:11:49] on the scripture they know you can't
[1:11:52] disprove even a single one William
[1:11:55] Branham already vetted that he stood
[1:11:56] there with 300 ministers who tried to
[1:11:59] trap him and brother Brandon gets up and
[1:12:02] says now I heard every one of you get up
[1:12:05] and say doctor this and DD and PhD and
[1:12:08] lld and all these things he said I
[1:12:10] haven't even got a seventh grade
[1:12:12] education but I challenge any of you to
[1:12:14] bring your Bible and come stand by my
[1:12:16] side and disprove any one of the
[1:12:19] doctrines that I teach bunch of quiet
[1:12:23] and quiet as mice not just scared mice
[1:12:28] brother Branham says what are you afraid
[1:12:30] of he said you're not afraid of me said
[1:12:32] but you're afraid of that light
[1:12:34] I'm gonna tell you something they were
[1:12:36] very very careful in the presence of
[1:12:38] that light oh I don't want to get off on
[1:12:42] that I'm it's it's it's they they know
[1:12:45] that the message is squarely on the
[1:12:47] scriptures what it does is it steps
[1:12:49] squarely on their toes because they
[1:12:52] can't have the life they want and get it
[1:12:54] to go through the scriptural filter you
[1:12:58] know Jacob gained a keen sense that he
[1:13:02] was on a journey why don't you turn with
[1:13:06] me to Genesis chapter 28 give me that on
[1:13:08] the board get Gideon Genesis 28 and
[1:13:11] let's start at at verse 10 I got a
[1:13:15] little bit of time left so I got about
[1:13:18] 17 18 minutes so let's get this Genesis
[1:13:23] 28 my what uh what an amazing and Jacob
[1:13:33] you know he's gonna be realizing a lot
[1:13:36] of these things even when he's still a
[1:13:37] shyster has it even become to his
[1:13:40] conversion yet he's going to go on a
[1:13:42] long journey but watch what's what
[1:13:44] happens to him and Jacob went out from
[1:13:48] Bayer Sheba and went toward Haran and he
[1:13:52] lighted upon a certain place and tarried
[1:13:55] there all night because the Sun was set
[1:13:56] and he took of the stones of that place
[1:13:59] and put them for his pillows and lay
[1:14:01] down in that place to sleep and he
[1:14:04] dreamed and behold a ladder set up on
[1:14:07] the earth and the top of it reached to
[1:14:09] heaven and behold the angels of God
[1:14:11] ascending and descending on it and
[1:14:13] behold the Lord God behold the Lord
[1:14:16] stood above it and said I am the Lord
[1:14:19] God of Abraham thy father and the god of
[1:14:22] Isaac the land whereon thou liest to
[1:14:26] thee will I give it and to thy seed and
[1:14:29] thy seed shall be as the dust of the
[1:14:32] earth and thou shalt spread abroad to
[1:14:35] the west and to the east and to the
[1:14:37] north to the south and in thee and in
[1:14:40] thy seed shall all the families of the
[1:14:43] earth be blessed
[1:14:44] and behold
[1:14:47] I am with thee and will keep thee in all
[1:14:51] places whither thou goest and we'll
[1:14:54] bring the again into this land and I
[1:14:57] will not leave thee until I have done
[1:15:00] that which I have spoken to the of and
[1:15:03] Jacob awakened out of his sleep and said
[1:15:05] surely the Lord is in this place and I
[1:15:08] knew it not and he was afraid and said
[1:15:11] how dreadful is this place this is none
[1:15:14] other but the house of God and this is
[1:15:16] the gate of heaven and Jacob rose up
[1:15:19] early in the morning and took the stone
[1:15:21] that he had put for his pillow set it up
[1:15:24] for a pillar and poured oil upon the top
[1:15:26] of it and he called the name of that
[1:15:28] place Bethel but the name of that city
[1:15:31] was called Luz at the first and Jacob
[1:15:34] vowed a vow saying if God will be with
[1:15:37] me and will keep me in this way that I
[1:15:40] go I will and will give me bread to eat
[1:15:43] and raiment to put on so that I come
[1:15:46] again to my father's house in peace then
[1:15:49] shall the Lord be my god and this stone
[1:15:53] which I have set for a pillar shall be
[1:15:55] God's house and of all that thou shalt
[1:15:59] give me I will surely give thee the
[1:16:02] tenth unto thee this is two hundred and
[1:16:05] seventy years before the law of Moses
[1:16:09] and Jacob is aware that he's he's on a
[1:16:14] journey and God comes down to commune
[1:16:17] with him and he wakes up and he he has a
[1:16:19] fear of God and that's a good thing to
[1:16:21] have is a fear of God you know - it'll
[1:16:25] it'll say I don't want to be afraid of
[1:16:26] anything it's not brother I'm said not a
[1:16:28] fear that he'll hurt you
[1:16:29] it's a it's an it's an awesome
[1:16:32] admiration and a fear that he's so
[1:16:34] powerful you want him as a comrade you
[1:16:38] want him as your Lord you want him as a
[1:16:40] friend you're you're destined to do
[1:16:42] anything that will displease him and
[1:16:45] Jacob is going on a journey and look
[1:16:48] Jacob is saying Amen - everywhere the
[1:16:50] Lord said I'll go with you and I'll stay
[1:16:52] with you and I'll prosper you and I'll
[1:16:54] even bring you back here which meant now
[1:16:56] he can't even die because the Lord's
[1:17:00] already said you'll go and I'll be
[1:17:01] I'll never leave and I'll bring you back
[1:17:03] here so no matter what it's gonna happen
[1:17:05] over here he's got a purpose he's got a
[1:17:07] journey and God already sees the end of
[1:17:10] it and Jacob is already saying Amen I'm
[1:17:13] gonna say a man to every word and he's
[1:17:16] made me this promise and he's made me
[1:17:17] that promise and if he keeps all of that
[1:17:19] then he's gonna be my lord he's gonna be
[1:17:21] my god there's going to be a church I'm
[1:17:23] gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna everything
[1:17:25] that I look at is gonna have a holy
[1:17:28] observation about it he's gonna give God
[1:17:31] a tenth of all that God gives him back
[1:17:34] now you notice something here's an
[1:17:36] interesting thing that Jacob learned on
[1:17:37] his journey it's funny that every man
[1:17:40] that ever comes into contact with God
[1:17:42] like Abraham or Jacob for whoever it is
[1:17:44] they're always giving him a tenth of
[1:17:45] everything they have it's like the thing
[1:17:48] to do when you get near God and and
[1:17:51] butBut don't don't don't think of it as
[1:17:54] some regulation cuz you're missing the
[1:17:56] beauty this is part of Jacob's worship
[1:18:00] Jake look at what he's doing he erect a
[1:18:03] stone and pours oil he's in the church
[1:18:05] service
[1:18:05] he's worshiping God and he's giving God
[1:18:08] his vows he's making he's pledging his
[1:18:11] heart and and he's saying here's one of
[1:18:14] my pledges that of everything you ever
[1:18:16] give me I will give you back the tenth
[1:18:18] do you know why people don't give God
[1:18:20] back the temp so often when they don't
[1:18:22] is because they worship other things
[1:18:26] they worship other things when Jacob
[1:18:28] gave the tenth to what he worshiped amen
[1:18:33] he's on a journey he realizes God has
[1:18:38] got control of his life and he wants it
[1:18:42] that way and then he the Bible says in
[1:18:46] 29 verse 1 then Jacob went on his
[1:18:51] journey and came into the land of the
[1:18:54] people of the east
[1:18:56] so Jacob arrives at Laban 's house
[1:18:59] and-and-and-and in an integral part an
[1:19:03] integral part of the journey that God
[1:19:07] has planned for Jacob here it is going
[1:19:10] to be the struggle that's
[1:19:14] of the plan that God is going to use
[1:19:17] that that's an integral part of the
[1:19:20] journey the struggle you know it's it's
[1:19:26] incredible that people you know
[1:19:28] sometimes you know you people who don't
[1:19:31] gather who don't even go to church at
[1:19:36] all or very rarely or you know as as
[1:19:41] we've been hearing preachers saying I've
[1:19:43] heard brother dig Satan heard brother
[1:19:45] Donnie saying I probably said it you
[1:19:46] know this pandemic is probably going to
[1:19:48] take people who will never come back to
[1:19:50] church never will made a decision that
[1:19:54] they're better off not coming and and
[1:19:57] lose sight but oh well you know to come
[1:20:02] to that church right there's a struggle
[1:20:03] and their struggle I'm like yeah you
[1:20:06] think that's by design you know you you
[1:20:10] you you know people who don't gather
[1:20:12] together for the benefit of having to be
[1:20:15] a part of a group and go through the
[1:20:17] struggles there's there's people you're
[1:20:21] gonna be in church near who are gonna
[1:20:23] really cost you a struggle you're gonna
[1:20:27] really struggle being around some people
[1:20:30] you know what it's good for you this say
[1:20:34] lord thank you for your servant who
[1:20:36] causes me to struggle you know but I
[1:20:41] mean if you spend your whole life and
[1:20:43] there's no running I'm talking about a
[1:20:45] journey now tonight you still with me
[1:20:46] come on I still got a few minutes you
[1:20:50] know no no running into negative
[1:20:54] experiences with other people and having
[1:20:57] to rise above it see having to learn the
[1:21:02] lessons no learning no learning to love
[1:21:05] and to forgive and to move forward
[1:21:08] together we're moving forward together
[1:21:13] we learn to love one another we learn
[1:21:17] we we live we love we forgive we fool
[1:21:23] forward hallelujah I'm glad it's that
[1:21:27] way I feel sorry for people who won't go
[1:21:31] that way because they they don't want
[1:21:34] the struggle it's a sad part of my
[1:21:40] struggle as I said as I opened up being
[1:21:43] a chosen of God to be a leader of men
[1:21:46] not something I would have never chose
[1:21:48] for myself but it's a sad part and my
[1:21:51] struggle to have to watch watching
[1:21:56] people who are under my care people who
[1:22:01] who won't commit to a few hours a week
[1:22:08] for the sake of their most valuable
[1:22:11] investment their soul and the souls of
[1:22:16] their loved ones and won't commit a few
[1:22:20] hours a week for the most valuable
[1:22:26] treasure they have when you're called of
[1:22:38] God to be a guide to other people over
[1:22:43] the years you see the product of
[1:22:46] decisions that are made by those under
[1:22:50] your care now on one side on one side
[1:22:53] seeing those who start out young making
[1:22:56] Word decisions in their lives and and
[1:22:59] and and and word decisions for their
[1:23:03] growing families and oh my it gives you
[1:23:06] such a sense of fulfillment such a sense
[1:23:09] of euphoria such a sense of
[1:23:11] accomplishment it it makes your spirit
[1:23:13] soar because you get to see the crop
[1:23:19] come up and flourish and then the beauty
[1:23:23] of that is I've been doing it long
[1:23:24] enough now that I've got to see many of
[1:23:27] them start
[1:23:28] now young and they mate word decisions
[1:23:30] and they started a family and they had a
[1:23:32] family with word decisions and now that
[1:23:34] families rose up and making work
[1:23:36] decisions and the cycle goes on and on
[1:23:38] that's the most wonderful fulfillment as
[1:23:40] a pastor I could ever have to see the
[1:23:44] product of the decisions coming out in
[1:23:47] God's favor the joy is almost
[1:23:51] indescribable but then on the other side
[1:23:54] you see decisions that are taken against
[1:23:57] the Word of God you you want them so
[1:24:00] desperately to soar like Eagles you want
[1:24:04] them to soar like Eagles and yet you
[1:24:11] have to stand to the side and watch
[1:24:13] helplessly as lives spin out of control
[1:24:17] and crash into the valley floor below it
[1:24:25] can be a sense of loss so deep you you
[1:24:28] never get over it really you see them in
[1:24:32] public and it all comes back I'm glad
[1:24:39] tonight that you know you might not
[1:24:41] understand that it's it's hard for me to
[1:24:43] express that brother branham and birth
[1:24:45] pains he says sometimes I I criticized
[1:24:47] the condition that we've gotten into he
[1:24:50] said that doesn't mean to any certain
[1:24:52] individual it's just the message I wish
[1:24:54] that it wasn't mine to give it tears me
[1:24:57] to pieces
[1:24:57] see because you you you see people they
[1:25:03] get too high-minded above the word and
[1:25:06] being spiritual minded in choosing the
[1:25:09] word you know choosing the the path of
[1:25:12] the word is so often abandoned there the
[1:25:17] Bible says that there is a way proverbs
[1:25:19] 14 you don't have to turn to it proverbs
[1:25:21] 14:12 there is a way that seemeth right
[1:25:24] unto a man but the end thereof are the
[1:25:27] ways of death and you know a lot of
[1:25:30] times friends what you what you think is
[1:25:33] a better path you know is wow how do i
[1:25:37] how do I say this
[1:25:41] a lot of times it's the devil playing
[1:25:45] you off of your inner secret desires and
[1:25:54] your desires of self-will and the
[1:25:57] selfishness of wanting your own way you
[1:26:06] know brother Branham talks about his
[1:26:08] nephew that should have never got
[1:26:09] married
[1:26:10] I've met men like that so they never got
[1:26:12] married I said oh never because you get
[1:26:15] married you're gonna have children and
[1:26:16] and you weren't you should have never
[1:26:17] you don't treat the wife right you're
[1:26:19] never going to treat the children right
[1:26:20] now I've met men that were so
[1:26:21] self-centered they should have never
[1:26:23] gotten married and you know it's a
[1:26:27] wonderful thing when God finally gets
[1:26:29] ahold of their lives but sometimes they
[1:26:32] can go a very very long time like this
[1:26:33] rich young ruler and and just constantly
[1:26:37] choose what they want so bad you know
[1:26:41] young people you understand the devil
[1:26:44] will play you he knows those inner
[1:26:47] weaknesses that you have he knows you're
[1:26:49] born with a mind contrary to God and
[1:26:51] he'll play you don't get played by the
[1:26:54] devil he's a master at it he's a master
[1:26:59] at it take your own a journey you're on
[1:27:01] a path you're trying to get home the
[1:27:02] celestial City choose God's Word choose
[1:27:07] God's Word every time you always come
[1:27:10] out right I mean I mean look all we can
[1:27:13] do all we can do let's just be honest
[1:27:15] about it all we can do is all we can do
[1:27:17] all you can do is just be humble and try
[1:27:20] your best and God's gonna have to save
[1:27:23] you God's gonna have to get us home I
[1:27:26] can't get me home you can't get you home
[1:27:28] he's gonna have to get us there all I
[1:27:31] can do is do my best but mine let me
[1:27:35] have them sealed to do my best and do
[1:27:40] all I can do because I've even seen God
[1:27:43] listen friends if you choose his word
[1:27:46] you're in such a wonderful place God is
[1:27:49] so loving and so kind I've seen God take
[1:27:52] those people that I was worth
[1:27:54] - a minute ago who made lifetimes of
[1:27:57] wrong decisions and your heart is aching
[1:27:59] and your heart is breaking and you see
[1:28:01] them do it and you see them the
[1:28:03] byproduct of and you see the product of
[1:28:05] the decisions and you weep as a shepherd
[1:28:07] but I've seen God come back when I
[1:28:10] thought there was no chance Oh God rich
[1:28:14] in mercy and reach a hand way further
[1:28:17] than I ever thought his hand could reach
[1:28:18] and grab ahold of and pull him back and
[1:28:21] go in and bring their children back and
[1:28:24] restore their home all we serve a
[1:28:26] wonderful powerful God who would not
[1:28:30] want to put your whole life into his

[1:28:35] for you he only wants you to live
[1:28:38] forever in a perfect world and give you

[1:29:16] above number two it's not comparable

[1:29:34] God's prostitute your time so there's
[1:29:37] more than just physical sexual adultery
[1:29:41] he said you can prostitute your time
[1:29:42] that you owe to God and you prostitute
[1:29:47] and give it to every other kind of thing
[1:29:48] that all it does is poison your mind and

[1:30:37] Lord hear me to abandon me every man and
[1:30:41] woman boy and girl have the wherewithal
[1:30:44] to say tonight I choose the path of the

[1:31:13] start gathering try your best to gather
[1:31:16] distanced with some distance apart so
[1:31:19] people who come to the front please come
[1:31:22] all the way forward because we're gonna
[1:31:23] have to be spaced out and those who go
[1:31:25] in the wings go all the way back sister

[1:31:28] let there you go perfect perfect Katie
[1:31:31] and and and make and kind of we gotta
[1:31:34] kind of state now families can group
[1:31:35] together it's no problem but we're just
[1:31:38] trying I was reading today from DHEC and
[1:31:42] what's the latest and it looks like
[1:31:45] we're gonna have to continue like this
[1:31:46] for a little while longer because
[1:31:49] they're still recommending social
[1:31:51] distancing as are as a must and it and
[1:31:55] it's just logistically impossible I
[1:31:58] would love to have the whole church here
[1:32:00] every service it is logistically
[1:32:02] impossible to do that in socially
[1:32:04] distance ourselves the building is just
[1:32:07] not big enough we've almost fill it up
[1:32:09] on Sundays and it's impossible to do so
[1:32:11] I'm sorry I want it as bad as you want
[1:32:14] it trust me I want to see us all back
[1:32:16] together again as the family of God

[1:32:31] couple days with a stomach ailment very
[1:32:34] strange and she's in a lot of discomfort
[1:32:36] and she always cries when she can't come
[1:32:40] to church I feel so sorry for I married
[1:32:43] a girl who loves going to church since
[1:32:45] she was a little girl and it bothers her
[1:32:47] to not get to come but she was just
[1:32:49] suffering
[1:32:51] Jerrica burns sent in and said my
[1:32:55] husband Sam now y'all know Sam we don't
[1:32:59] see him often we see Jericho more often
[1:33:01] but but Sam's a good guy I mean I did
[1:33:03] their wedding and I really liked him
[1:33:07] from the first first minute I met him
[1:33:09] she says my husband Sam has an unknown
[1:33:12] mass likely a cyst or a benign tumor on
[1:33:15] his esophagus right behind his heart
[1:33:20] I thought brother Larry said it was
[1:33:22] between the heart and esophagus so
[1:33:24] that's a little bit confusing but he is
[1:33:26] anyway the bottom line is he's having
[1:33:28] surgery on Friday to remove it which
[1:33:31] will take at least six weeks to recover
[1:33:33] from asking prayer that the surgery goes
[1:33:36] perfectly while I like somebody to ask
[1:33:38] them I like that word let's ask that it
[1:33:41] go perfectly and that he recovers
[1:33:45] quickly
[1:33:46] my sister-in-law Karen white asked
[1:33:49] continued prayer for Brandon of course
[1:33:52] her son and she was sending me a little
[1:33:55] bit of praise report he's still got a
[1:33:57] lot of complications physically a lot of
