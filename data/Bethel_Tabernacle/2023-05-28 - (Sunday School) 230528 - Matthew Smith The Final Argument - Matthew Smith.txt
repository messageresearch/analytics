TRANSCRIPT
========================================
um king over France and he commissioned a bunch of cannons, right? Commissioned he was building up his army, commissioned a bunch of cannons and across the the breach of the cannon he had inscribed um uh ultima ratio regium which for those of you who don't know Latin means the final argument of the king. Okay. So what this king is saying is when people come before me to have legal disputes, this duke over here has some claim to a land and this lord over here is a counter claim and they're arguing and this that and the other and I give a decree. No, this is the judgment. People can sit here and keep arguing, but at the end of the day, if they don't obey what I said, we're going to have a line of cannons about it, right? Like you can make all your arguments all you want and you can have your documents and your legal dispute, but that's not going to stop a 18lb cannonball screaming through the air at several hundred feet per second. It's just not going to happen. You know, like at some point you just have to accept that this is the reality. And so this is just something that I've known since I was a kid. And and when I you know that that little history story and you know when I was struggling with all this you know like Lord how do you how do I know that you're real? How do I know the message is real? How do I know all these things? What's what's the reality here? What's how do I know? Because for everyone that says that it happened, there's another one who says that it didn't happen and it was so far before I was born. I can't verify any of this. So what do I do? and I'm struggling and it on one hand I have all of these arguments right from a scientific perspective right how do you prove this all all of that and it's really good arguments and in a court of law it might actually work like if you're trying to have some sort of you know civil case about it but on the other hand I'm looking at people who are legitimately good people that I know aren't putting on who are behaving in Christlike ways that go beyond just human reasoning. There's no possible way people could be that good all the time, right? Even when you see the flaws, even when they stumble and fall and face plant in their Christianity, they still get back up and are better for it. How is that possible? Right? People who were willing to love me when I'd been a massive booger. like it was just people who are willing to just just be genuinely loving people and you look at the love of people the love of Christ inside of people and go oh that's real that's not you know it's like um you know brother Brandham tells the story of Bert right meanest man in town what was it I mean this is the man who' been hunting with brother Brandham for years you think brother Brandham had never read him a scripture brother Brandham you Brother Brandham had never told him what he believed in, had never tried to win him over. How many times brother Brandham try to try to influence this man? And a prophet, an actual literal vindicated word prophet could not win that man's heart, but a deer. A mama deer loving her baby could because that the love of Christ is the it's the argument, right? There's no counterargument to that. It's the king's final argument. It's the ultimate weapon. There's no We can sit here and have all kinds of debate about, well, this news clipping and and that magazine and and this person said that and there's this person who, you know, met Brother Brandon. Okay, great. Awesome. I don't care because it's the best way I've ever put it. I've ever heard it put when you know you you wonder, well, is God real? Yes or no? We can have a lot of arguments about it. But at the end of the day, I know God is real the same way I know every one of you is real because I've met you, right? I've met you. I've I've shaken your hand. I've I've looked you in the eye. We've had a conversation. I know you're real, right? And I know God is real because I've met God and he's come down and talked to me and I know how different my life is. It's not verifiable. It's not very scientific. But it is a piece that passes understanding, right? It's beyond understanding. It's not supposed to be understood, right? It's not supposed to make sense. It's not supposed to have some sort of, you know, uh, peer-reviewed paper. Um, and so to me, you know, and I and I felt like this is um like uh the man born blind in John chapter 9. We don't have to turn to it or nothing. I can just read it, but or I I'll just tell you the story. Um it's the man who was born blind and he's on the side of the road begging and doesn't say how old he is. Um, I think he was in my mind I believe he was kind of a younger man, maybe in his 20s or so. And um, he he can't make a living. He can't do anything. He's he's blind. He's completely unable to support himself. All he can do is is get by on the on the charity of those people around him. Completely helpless. And and you know, he the the Lord is passing by and he heals the man, right? and he he he anoints his eyes and and he tells him to go wash at the pool and he washes his his eyes and he can see. And so it's this big deal. He's going around telling everybody, "Praise the Lord. This Jesus healed my eyes." And um the Pharisees go looking into this like, "Hey, you can't be going around saying this. Don't you know that like this Jesus, he's like Belzeub, right? Now, you know that he's he did this on the Sabbath day. He healed you on the Sabbath day. So, clearly it was of the devil. Um, and he's and the man's going, "Okay, well, how do you how do you explain? I mean, nobody heals somebody and being of the devil. That's not the way this works. Show me in the Bible where this happened." And so, I want to just read here. This is from verse 24. He says, "Then again called the man uh that was blind and said unto him, give God the praise. We know this man is a sinner. He answered and said, "Whether he'd be a sinner or no, I know not. One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see." Then said to him, "What did he do to thee? Uh, how opened he thine eyes?" He answered them, "I have told you already, and ye did not hear. Wherefore uh would ye would ye hear it again? Would ye also be his disciples?" Then they reviled him and said, "Thou art his disciple, but we are Moses' disciples." So here they are. Here they are going, "Well," you know, he's going, "I don't know. We can sit here and have this argument about the law and whether or not he should have do healings on the Sabbath day, but what I know is that none of y'all could heal my eyes." Yeah. Right. What I know is that I was blind and I can see now. You know, when I look at my life and people are, you know, well, how do you know that the message of the hour is legit? Well, what I know is that I was blind and now I can see, right? What I know is that I was a wretched, awful person who was just the worst and now I'm not and I didn't do it. Right? God did that and it's through this message. It's it's because of that. Nothing else did that, right? You know, no no, you know, uh anything would have done that. So, um, you know, and and so we know that the the word of God, it's this that's what it is. You know, going back to what we said, it's it's that bloodstained banner. We we everything that the that a Christian is is built on that. The final argument of Christ is that cross. There's, you know, when the when the devil comes before the throne to accuse the church and say, "Well, they're guilty of this, they're guilty of that. Oh, they they they have to bear the burden of this sin. they have to bear the burden of this uh this sickness because of sin. Well, but there was a there was a there was a a price that was paid, right? There's a there's a an atonement there that there isn't it's not logical. It's not scientific, right? The love of God is not scientific. It's not it's not something that you can argue against, right? You know, even even from if we say that that through sin that you know that that sin is atoned for, that means the penalty of sin is atoned for, right? You know, if someone's pardoned, they don't go to jail. Amen. If we have a pardon from sin, then what is the penalty of sin, right? Well, it's sickness. It's being broken. It's being being chained to all these different things. Well, we don't have to suffer that anymore. We have a a a we have an ultimate enforcement. And um you know that's I I feel like so many often times we don't we don't take advantage of that. We don't we don't recognize that this is there's more you know the love of God extends to the Christians right the love of God extends to the sinner. The love of God extends to everybody and no matter what your situation may be that's it's the final answer right there's no there's no argument beyond it. And even if it doesn't make any sense, right? You know, if the if a doctor is telling you something that is contrary to your healing, well, it doesn't have to make sense. Since when is since when is the Bible based on on, you know, evidence? When is since when is this based on on some uh what do you call it? You know, peer-reviewed study. If you're gonna take if you're gonna take that level of scrutiny to it, you know, just not only to the message, if you take it to the message, I think I heard brother Matt Watkins say this one time and it absolutely articulated this spot on. If you take that level of of scrutiny to the message of the hour, it does not lead you to denomination. It leads you to atheism because you kick the legs out from under the message. the exact same set of standards if you apply it to the Bible will do the same thing. You have no at some point you got to take it on faith. At some point, the only way to have that faith is to meet God and know God, right? At some point is to experience the power of God in your life. That's the only way that this works. And so, um, do you do you have that video? Cool. um just start playing it and I'll talk over it um until we get to a certain point. So um this is a video clip from the from 1953. The army is is testing out a new cannon that they built since we have a cannon theme. Um we uh they're building this new cannon and one of the things that I noticed about this is when the the cannon fires you it'll actually tell you can tell when the when the round hits the target. It takes a while. Like it takes a good couple of minutes. Um not minutes but like you know a good couple of seconds. And um oftent times you know we'll we'll pray and we'll ask the Lord you know what what is our we'll ask for for for deliverance of something and it takes a minute, right? We load our our Isaiah 53 into the into the gun and pull the trigger but it's going to take a minute to hit, right? And so don't lose faith because you know the round got fired because that's a nuclear cannon. thing fires an atomic bomb and you know they built this thing because they're crazy. Um but because you know colloquially they call a nuclear weapon unleashing the power of the sun. Well folks you have the final argument of the king. You can unleash the power of the s o n right? Whatever situation is in your life, you pull the trigger. You put Isaiah 53 into action. It might take a minute. Amen. It might take a minute, but all your problems get wiped out. There's nothing left standing. That's right. Right. Whatever the enemy has in your way, no matter no matter how many, you know, MRIs come back with a bad report, no matter how many whatever the doctor says about your baby, Brother Caleb, it doesn't matter. It might take a minute, but the sun is on the case, right? The, you know, they they have this new um in Ukraine, they just sent those new artillery shells that are guided. They can fire and it actually has a guidance system, so it it's pinpoint accurate every time. They call it Excalibur, right? Like the sword from King Arthur. Well, we have a two-edged sword that you can put that behind what you need and pull the trigger and it's going to hit the target every time. It'll never miss. Yeah, because the love of God does not miss, right? Whatever you have need of that that that blood has atoned for any situation that you have. So, I guess that's where I got to quit. Um, we can stand and have a word of prayer. Dear father, Lord, thank you for this opportunity to maybe give someone some encouragement. Father, that maybe they would be weary, that they would be struggling, Lord. That I would just if I could have one requested that my words would go out and encourage somebody and help them through their day, help them through their week, Father. that when the devil would have them beat down that they would be able to maybe have that that thought in the back of their mind that you're there to to protect them, Father. That you're there to to save them, Father. And so, Lord, we're we're so thankful for all that you've done. So grateful for your for your atonement. So grateful for everything you've done. And on this Memorial Day, we think of all the men that would have died, heroes that would have died for a good cause, Father. that there was one hero above all heroes who died for the greatest cause. So, Father, we're thanking you, Father, for everything that you've done in Jesus name. Amen.
