are very grateful and thankful for this moment to get opportunity to come into your presence Lord we are hungry men father and the prophet made us to understand that God is our meal that is why we are here tonight we are here to feed on the word of God yes because we have a strong desire in our hearts to be transformed into your image you can never come for a bride that is not looking like you so therefore Lord we are here for the transformation come and speak to our heart bless my friend opening the doors for me this time R again for this wonderful Union and fellowship thank you for your grace come and vindicate your power among your people in Jesus Christ name I pray with Thanksgiving amen okay you can turn your Bibles with me I want to read my text from the book of First Peter First Peter chapter 1 I'm sorry 1 Peter chapter 2: 5 First Peter chapter 2 vers 5-10 ye also as slavy stones are buil up a spiritual house and a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also as it contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion on a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be H but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallow the same is made the head of the Conor and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which tumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and a holy nation A peculiar people all right that ye should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God yes which have not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy may the Lord add blessing to R of it so you can have your seat friends yeah we are gathering here for one purpose we here to see Jesus Christ the prophet said depend what you want to see so when you come to church and you want to see a bishop maybe God can present a bishop for you if you want to see a Founder maybe God will let you see a Founder but if you are here to see Jesus you will see Jesus because that is what you want to see so I believe tonight we are here to see Jesus Christ and if that is our heart I believe he will reach somebody with that is a perfect Revelation and then we will understand why we came to this uh fellowship tonight now I'm very grateful to have my friends when I spoke to Pastor it has been a while maybe some people cannot remember who is BR Thomas but Jason has been a wonderful friend during the time of my friend John Kate when he was alive so I was coming through for a while but uh yeah after covid I think we caught a little bit so I was not getting opportunity to come this way but I thank God that this time around God has opened the doors for me to have fellowship with the church and my good friend like I heard him say yes when I started to get the plot where we are Breen in that is arra that locality to Fellowship this church you supported the project I really appreciate for your God bless you for that and I thank the Lord that I when I told my friend said okay I will be on the bus and maybe I was looking for where to stop because the bus it looked like it is no more coming to be so I was looking looking at some Veil or something like that but my Brun I'm right with him in Atlanta said no brother I will drive you so let me tell J that I will drive you and then get you back to Atlanta again so why say you ref to do that I said yes I will do that so briano said no if you are driving bras I'll also go with you so that's wonderful so that's is BR and can you stand up for the people to know who you are he's a wonderful preacher very Mighty preacher and that Angelo there Angelo yeah God bless you for this sacrifice yeah I appreciate that I really appreciate that we thank God so we are we are here for one purpose to hear the voice of God uh and my subject tonight is peculiar people peculiar people I believe tonight I'm here to address peculiar people now listen I am not an English man like you so I wanted to understand what P peculiar means so when I look at the dictionary he said peculiar he said said characteristics of one person or a thing or group distinctive different from normal right or isua then it comes uniqueness being the one only Soul s o e so then two being without a like or equal unequal I said wow that is unique so every character is assigned to somebody who is peculiar in that manifestation all right so it makes you unique it makes you different from other people because you have your uniqueness yes sir now God the Supreme creator of the universe he is also unique in his characteristics very unique uncomparable nobody could compare his character or his attribute everything we cannot compare it with God no so now God making his choice distinctive his peculiar nature could only be manifest as long as Israel keep his word because he chose Israel all the nations because he wanted to make a perfect Masterpiece we all know the story said when Adam fell God has to quickly make a master pce and that's how he pick Abraham to get a perfect Masterpiece out of Abraham and we see Isaac coming we see that Jacob and the prophet just made us to understand Grace that is love he he explained everything to us God building another Masterpiece and he made a covenant with Abraham that he will never that is fail Abraham God is not a covenant breaker right when he makes a covenant he keeps his Covenant so he told Abraham that I've chosen you and your people will be peculiar they will be Above All Nations all all tongs all kindr they will be completely different now listen in Exodus Exodus Exodus 193 and Moses went up unto God and the Lord called him out of the mountain saying th shall thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear you on Eagle wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed there's condition here if you obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which thou shall speak unto the children of Israel sir God is looking for people that he can really transfer his pecularity to all right he's looking for people that when you see those people you will see god wow so now he's speaking to Moses Moses this is what I have that I've thought of and I want to do to Abraham seed so that they will just reflect my image wow so tell them the only condition is that they must keep my word wowu hallelu he said if thou has chosen and affirmed the Lord as thy God and to walk in his ways and to keep his Commandment that is the only way to keep the peculiarity of God now in Deuteronomy it says God is also re reaffirming because it is something that is very very important so God continue to affirm this word to Israel Deuteronomy 26:16 let us go this day the Lord thy God had commanded thee to do this States and judgment thou shall therefore keep and do them with all that heart and with all thy Soul there has a watch is that the correct pronunciation a o u c h i th a the Lord this day to be thy God and to walk in his ways and to keep his statutes and his commandment and his judgment and to hecken onto his voice and the Lord have have AED the this day to be his peculiar people as he had promise thee and thou shall thou should keep all his commandment all right and to make the High Above All Nations which he have made in praise and in name and in honor and that th mayest be the holy people unto the Lord thy God as he has spoken I thought I was looking for that meaning it means he said to declare as a matter of a fact for a that can be proven to affir so he said Israel has a voice they have affirmed that God is their God they have made a choice they've hen to the voice of God that if you we are your people you are our God they have confirmed that and God also confirm with them that you are my God if you have recognize if you have realized that I am your God I am also your god wow Hallelujah so he went further to affirm his promise that you will be a peculiar Nation a spiritual priesthood to offer Praises God has his purpose of creating us friends he created us to praise him you are here to praise God that is why we are on this Earth said Angels were praising holy holy holy but God was not satisfied all right he wanted to get his own image wow wow praising him worshiping him falling at his feet then he will become a king and then he he will know his said yeah look at my people praising me that is why we are here tonight now listen the Lord did not choose isra because they are few or because they are many but he loved them in Deuteronomy chapter 7 verse 6 he said for thou art an holy people he is affirming it again to Israel you are a holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God has have chosen thee to be a Especial people unto himself yeah above all people that are upon the face of the Earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because ye are are more in number than any people for ye are the fewest of all people but because the Lord love you you see the condition it's love it is not because is like there were few or there were many it is the love of God God loves you and because he will keep the oath which he has sworn unto your fathers he can never deny his off he has made a ofto your fathers have the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeem you out of the house of bond men from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God who keep Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandment to a thousand Generations God speaking to Israel he want Israel to keep his pecularity so the people know that Israel is a nation for God the prophet said said when I stand behind the poit to preach he said I don't want to see you in flesh now in the message there is resurrection of Lazarus if they can put it for you this is 51 tape number 0729 0729 51 paragraph 36 now notice then that is where we are that is what is the matter with the Pentecostal people now it is it is my lot this afternoon to preach and I have a right here at the platform and I don't even want to know any person from the flesh when I stand I am standing here we are not supposed to see you in flesh Pastor Jesse will not stand here and see flesh we have to stand here and see Holy Ghost F Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah we are born again Hallelujah I am not here to look at this flesh that is why we are one we are not one you are white man black man but we are one in spirit the Holy Ghost In You the same Holy Ghost is in me Hallelujah you don't we are not here to see flesh you're here to see the Holy Ghost so he said that is what a matter with the Pentecostal people they don't recognize whom they are I don't think we are in that category we know whom we are Pentecost don't recognize their place but we will know our place place if you don't know your place then you have to come to the altar the prophet says something here who is this MEC 65 number 0221 paragraph 117 being Eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had his thought of what you was only he wanted he wanted me to stand in the pulit say he wanted you to sit in that seat tonight then we are serving his eternal purpose and the one that left home only come to the Earth to serve his purpose is that right we here to save his purpose you you you are sitting on the SE where she l there it's a responsibility for you to say right there it's a responsibility for J to stand here and preach the word yes Lord he has to feed you that's why it's very strange for people to say that we don't need a pastor he said he said now listen where should we not see one another in flesh why why why is that I should not see you in flesh because we have a new parent we are born again the prophet said now you are born again you have a new parent who gives you the training of the family and you require to be identified with the family after the training father gives you a weapon and set you at the battle front you have what it takes to defeat the opponent you need not to retreat need not to fear need not to complain father has so much confidence and trust in you to overcome he might be a demon of sickness demon of poverty selfishness fornication Envy Li anger and whatever more you have a special training and a weapon to overcome the Challenger listen to what the prophet said here the oness of unity 58 T number 0128 parag 132 God bless you don't think I am beside myself that's true I know what I talk of Men of Honor women you who believe in God you who claim to have the spirit of God in your heart if you are sick or needy you have got the weapon there to fight that sickness withall it is in you God gave it to you where will you stand back like a coward when will you stand on the side line let's follow the captain let's follow him that went to Calvary when he went to Calvary he was wounded for our transgression he was by with his faor healed take that what he give you and fight sickness and sin all right fight unbelief away tell the Devil he's a liar Christ said he has overcome the world greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world greater is the power of Christ in you than that sickness that you have in your body tonight greater is the power of Christ that than that little besetting sin that you cannot overcome let us take that Holy Spirit and fight the devil down and walk out Victorious as the heroes of the Cross peul people don't forget you must admit let nobody take it from you you you are peculiar people different so the prophet went F the perfect Faith perfect Faith paragraph 117 this is3 0825 paragra I will see just how advanced my church is on what we believe in see just how advanced the people are how they are ready to take their sword and walk out in the front line and say I challenge you Satan you see I challenge you you canot make me disbelief anymore hallu what are these things done for so that the people will believe it is the word it is where that shows that I am pre what I'm preaching to you is the truth the word the word made flesh made flesh in you made flesh made flesh in you and they made flesh in me you see God is looking for peculiar people and that's why he chose Israel now the prophet said when God give you new parents he give you new training now you are ready now this is in the message you must be born again 61 tape number 1 2 31 1 2 3 1 paragraph 82 now you are ready now for life you are ready to start out now you now you are born a new born in the family of God with a new parent you understand when you are born again you are born with a new parent so your character will change the old character will cease because you are born by a new parent so you don't manifest that old Family character again you are new a new generation sir Royal people you understand peculiar the people don't forget our subject because Israel refused God Israel they disbel you know how they made their choice God is their King we know Samuel you remember the story they said no Samuel we want to be like the people of the world but God said you are peculiar people you are not like the world separate yourself and let your pecularity hold and then you keep reflecting my image to all the world so the people don't know that you have a special God a different God from their gods but is friends they made a wrong choice yes sir they said no we want to be like the people of the world the pecularity went out of them we will come to that like something said they show all his locks all his poity left him that is Israel they made a wrong choice in mat 2722 when P ask asked he said unto them what shall I do with Jesus which is called Christ Matthew 27:22 they all say unto him let him be crucified and the governor said why what evil have he done but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified when P saw that he could not Prevail nothing but that rather a t a tumult was made he took water and washed his hand before the multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this just person you see see ye to it then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and on our children you see what Israel is going through now they call for it yes sir they rejected their King they rejected their visitation if you're not careful we also going to refuse our visitation God has visit visited also in flesh our Prophet Willam and Abram if you are not careful we also just for fit that we will lose our visitation Israel they rejected their visitation and they called the blood of Jesus to come upon that that is what is going on today but friends Israel cannot they cannot do any other thing until the bread has gone out I always say BR J we are really we are we we are putting more woes to Isel because we are not ready to go if you leave this earth God will attend to Israel yes sir he will come and reveal himself to them now the Revelation is with the Gentiles we have seen the revelation of Christ because we The Chosen then we will come to that but why do we hinder Israel brother let us get ourselves ready to go let us go home I have another message I didn't know how what God wanted me to we are strangers and pilgrims I have a Mery on that now listen second Peter the we read I mean First Peter chapter 2 he said now why is Peter speaking this God spoke to Israel that you Israel you are peculiar people a chosen generation but Peter no he's not addressing is right Peter is addressing the Saints yeah which means the blessing that belongs to Israel like Jacob is it Jacob who cross his son Jacob when he cross then it mean the blessing has to come to the Gentiles at the cross you see it so now Peter is saying First Peter chapter 2:9 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy A peculiar people that you should show forth the cises of him who have called you out of Darkness into His Marvelous Light which in time pass we not the people but I not the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now has obtain Mercy why should this blessing come to us because Israel rejected God but God is still Bend to get Peculiar people all right yes sir he said want to have peculiar people who will reflect his image because it was sin that deny us from that manifestation but thank God sin has been abolished Behold the Lamb of God that taken away the sins of the world where should Li allow sin to surprise me again where whereas the sacrifice already be made amen before I could sin it the lamb was slain in the thought of God listen Romans 12:1 I be you therefore breing by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove that which is good and acceptable and perfect will of God you see it God is looking for people that will really manifest his glory that is why Paul say you are an EP written Hallelujah yes sir in identification say people will not buy the Bible again but when you walk on the Street a Bible a Bible today my friend if you not buy a Bible you read me Hallelujah Bible you understand now Paul was telling us to be very very that is we have to be warned the Gentiles because Israel has rejected God if you are not therefore we can also do the same so Romans 11:2 Paul said where because of unbelief they were breaken off and thou standed by faith be not be highminded by fear Romans 11:20 if you are not careful we also going to lose this Grace he has broken Israel off and brought us wild o he has really got us in because Israel refuse God but still God want his pecularity to be seen he want to express his glory hallu hallu so therefore he has to look for a gentle bride so the in the book of Hebrew he said but Hebrews chapter 3 ver 17 say but with them with whom was he grieve 40 years it it was it not with them that has sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe it was to them they believe not so you see they could not enter in because of unbelief that is Israel but you are privileged tonight yes sir because your eyes are been anointed your ears are anointed to see and to hear the mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven where you reject your be fright Esau rejected it but Jacob his eyes were set on it his eyes was his his Focus was all on the be fright you are FOC must be on the Holy Ghost the prophet said we don't come here in in token we don't come to UE we don't come to bring C we come here to apply the token that's today people bring the co and they fighting brother you don't fight with Co let me see the Holy Ghost in you that will settle all dispute amen amen if you have Holy Ghost and have we will not fight even if there's misunderstanding Holy Ghost will really blend us together we will not fight a now es that is in the fourth seal was talking about four seal 63 tape number 0312 no 0321 0321 paragraph 296 now Esa was a religious man he didn't claim to be an unbeliever he believed in the same God Jacob did Same God his daddy did but he was just a shter or excuse me that expression he said said now as far as being moral he was better more acting man than Jacob was but you see he didn't oh what's the best right got to do with it and he sold his birth right to Jacob you see but Jacob he didn't have big things like just like Esau did he didn't have the inheritance it was not for him as it was for Esau but there was one thing Jacob wanted was the be FR he didn't care how he had to get it he was going to get it and God had respect I don't care receive the Holy Ghost if you have I have to stand here and cry and and beat the puppet until I receive I I'll remain here and receive the Holy Ghost I don't care because it is my inheritance without the Holy Ghost FR I forget about you sitting on the PE and they always listening to the message without the Holy Ghost it do not help you let us be honest to ourselves it's not because Jason is your father it's not because the Deon is your father it's because you say in the M sh it's because personally you have met with God not because you are Pastor met God this man will be on the mountains praying he he want to meet with God like Moses so that he can get something for you but you must also meet with God as an individual now here we sit in the congre ation as priesthood the prophet the early messages 47 T number 11 23 4711 23 the children of Israel listen what prophet said here I guess it is not against the law to say this in maybe Beford let he use fish here but let me use Beford I

you are a royal priesthood A peculiar people offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruit of our lips giving praise unto him oh my the fruit of your Li pouring out praise daily before the people what a high priest that we have what a priesthood that we are in the priesthood of the circumcision not of flesh but of the heart amen the heart circumcision by the Holy Ghost that's right then you

rejecting some NOS but he will take your an NOS amen Hallelujah hallu because it is coming from the Holy Ghost noise Hallelujah it is not you putting up it is not you making just an ordinary noise it's Holy Ghost Noise by one Spirit when God want to really plant his specularity in his people it is by one Spirit not your nature not my nature it we have to get the character of Christ molded in US yes sir you understand that is why Paul was saying here 1 Corinthians 12 verse for as the body is one and have many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ sir for by one Spirit not two Spirits by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body one whether you be a Jew or gentle or American or ghanian whether you are Bor or free and have been we have all been made to drink into one Spirit yes sir that is why when I see you I see God when I stand behind the pulit I will see God in the congregation am Hallelujah if I stand here and I don't see God then let us fold our doors and go home I have to stand here and see God yes sir and you that sit on that seat you must see God here so when life and life meet glory in his presence Glory he said it will be an explosion yes sir that is why we must see fire in uncertain sound I be with go said when the people in be for they hear fire fire in J Church what will happen is aing people will run here he said we a lot of Moses will run to look at fire amen a lot of Moses when Moses saw the fire it was an attraction he turned to look at the fire let the Holy Ghost come and let this church be on fire and let us see what happen brethren we must really display what we have it is time for us to manifest God not talk about God let me see what you have you understand Ezekiel 22:26 Ezekiel her priest has violated my law and have profaned my holy things they have put no differ between the holy and the profan neither have they show different between the unclean and the clean and have hid their eyes from the sabath and I am and I am profan among them they couldn't distinguish you cannot see the holy and the propen but God is looking for his pecularity he want to see his nature in you yes sir that is why you have brother said you must come to the land of adoption many of us we never come to the land of adoption brother if you never got to that land I am calling somebody come to the land of adoption this tonight you need to come to that land if you never come to that land of adoption there's something wrong something is missing you understand listen what the prophet said here in the message hear ye him 1960 T number zero 86 086 086 paragraph 37 now when God set his sons out Sons and Daughters he got a tutor or a razor somebody to raise them for sons and daughters and it wasn't a bishop neither was it a cardal he couldn't trust them so he got the best that was in heaven to raise his church right the Holy Spirit he is the tutor of the church and we have tell he is honest he will tell the father just asly what we are doing you cannot hide your report will go he will not hold back one thing he will be honest before the father how his children is progressing now that is the reason he picked that one there was no better he could find than to have the Holy Spirit we have adopted everything else by the Holy Spirit we don't want the Holy Spirit to teach us we want to let the bishop tell us what to do and the Cal somebody to tell us what to do don't make any difference what they say if it is contrary to the word of God and the leading of the Holy Spirit listen listen to the Holy Ghost for that is your tutor amen he's your tutor where are we going to get this training and this ordination we must come to the land of adoption in the message a hidden life you you can put it for us 55 T number 1006 55 1 paragraph 47 every man that comes to the pulit ought to dwell alone first yeah yes sir friends we cannot jump here and say pre that is why when you sit on that seat if God has not ordained you to preach brother don't try it it is not an intellectual something it is a holy ghost driven am hallu it's not because you are leared maybe you are leared than the pastor because you leared that you think you can take this place it is Holy Ghost so he said every man that stays in the presence of God into this great secret place hid our away will yield the fruits of ousness peace Joy love joy longsuffering goodness gentleness patience don't fuse about these other things get that in your life and you will never get it until you hid away with God into the land of adoption into the land of adoption you understand so if you you never got there brother I am really ENT I'm encouraging somebody to come to the land of adoption that is where you understand what we are talking about amen Israel they have refused God now but when you meet God when you meet God personally you wouldn't need anyone's interpretation you will take God at his word yes sir you understand you don't need somebody's interpretation in the message ENT the identify Christ of all ages 64 tape number 0617 42 said and until you come in behind that bger skin until you get out of your own old skin your old TOS your old G and come into the presence of God then the word becomes a living reality to youall then you are awakened to the Shak Glory then the Bible becomes a new book then Jesus Christ is the same yesterday when you come behind that Veil when you allow this burger skin to drop and then the Inner Man start to operate this is Waring it is always Waring against the Inner Man yes sir that's what we are we are dealing with yes but thank God you have what it Tak for you to be overcome in the M how can I overcome said you were born defeated in a defeated home in a defeated word in a defeated Community but you must overcome because God has given you something to bring you as an overcomer do you understand that is why we need because God is molding a bride how did he mold Jesus in trying to do God service how did he bring Jesus here he said he brought Jesus here by the word you understand how can he get the bride by the word and if he can get the briad by the word then he has to get five four Ministry like this man here like this man sitas brother we have our Ro to play for your perfection Hallelujah we have our thank you Lord thank so when God send the mission I'm coming going around as a missionary if you open your door like brother has opened all what God has given to me I'll give it and I go my way I told some bre Breen honestly if I come and I preach and my concept my idea is to make money get me out from your get me out I'm telling you in PL word if it is because of money please get me out sir because any man that do the work of God because of money he's not fit to do the work of God brother it is a responsibility it is falling on your law to preach the word you are not prey because you want to make money you understand and you if God ask you to pay tix you are not paying tix to make this marriage it is your responsibility and it is my responsibility to preach is your respon ability to give if you not do your part forget the work of God will still go on it will still go yes sir God will not wait for you the prophet said you must be somebody's fool in the message the he said you must be somebody's full 64 0531 05 22 let me cut it short 23 so you have to be somebody fo so I would rather be a fool for Christ see I will be God God said his people are A peculiar people they are old a chosen elected a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifice to God that's it the fruit of our Liv giving praise to his name all people love at you people shine you people ridic you they will call you names but you are an allall because you peculiar the peculiarity you are really manifesting is different hallelujah hallelujah the world will not understand you why is it that you beautiful you don't wear pants how can they understand you why is it that you don't paint your faces you don't put your lips they cannot understand you because you are peculiar people hallelujah pecul yes sir you're not part of the world you are strangers and prant you understand no the prophet said here in the message once more once more 63117 111 317 63 1117 paragraph 118 and that is the same thing that is happening to the church you are born a peculiar people a holy nation a royal priesthood but what happened you have let the world shave all your peculiarities all your peculiar has been shaped until you have become one of them 63 T number 1117 paragraph 118 put that for rest the world you have allowed the world to shave all your peculiar out of you and you have become one of them you H you had to have a denomination like they had you have to aan the BST of the Methodist one and now the assemblies are trying to a the United and the United a the assemblies and the Church of God how this oh my my and on and on 30 or 40 different organization you see like the dog returning to it vomit the same thing you have allowed the world to shave your pecularity out of you what is wrong with you what happened to you Samson what happened to you you that God has got God has Ed God has confident in you that you will manifest his glory but what is happened to the bride today we are fighting with G we are drawing lines you cannot cross over say we are building Beaver how do you call it beaver dams Dam this Dam belongs to brother Jason nobody can fish here it is my D friends don't build Downs let the water flow your brother out there want to drink don't block the water but people don't want it to flow you can keep it in your own environment it will stink super sign now look at how the world they want everything to be super

woman nobody will buy they will not buy unless you put those pictures to attract them you understand so he said in super sign said now super sign 61 0 4 2 uh 0430 0430 par 2 28 and I want to speak this afternoon upon the subject of super sign this is the day of super everything has to be super or it would if or if they haven't if it isn't a super product it will not sell and we remember that because that human beings God knowing their nature and something in man that no matter how far he has fallen yet in design he is a Son of God desly God design him in his own fashion so regardless of where you are falling there's something in you that is why when a Son of God you sin you cannot remain in sin because there's something in you that is crying AB you know your place you know that you a child of God and because you're a child of God the spirit bear witness of your spirit that you a child of God nobody can take your place we need that peculiar that pecularity to display to this world let us show case let us let the people know that we are God's children Pro to them that is a true witness yes sir look at the city of SAA that is in the the land of the the Samaritans this woman of the world when he saw the identific when he saw the car when he saw the manifestation he said ah wait a minute I know he did not say we know I know mesiah cometh yes sir what is going on here here he said I that speak to you I amall what caused that to happen because he performed that is the identification of the Messiah was displayed to this woman yes sir they identify Christ of all AG 64041 paragraph 149 and the people of that City without seeing it done the whole city believe on him that's right why his characteristics of what he was he was identified to that the of sucha he was identified the mesiah of God by his character characteristic was in him because he was he was the god of the prophet he was the prophet he was the prophet manifested he has always been down through the age the same and if he is the same yesterday today for let us see him manifesting am I it is not because this man don't have faith it is because spor of you don't have faith faith and Faith when it comes together there will be expl when you are coming to be prayed for and you have faith to be healed right you you don't need even to be pray for because you come through the prayer line with your and then you go with your healing like brother somebody a woman was coming to the prayer he was holding crotches he said Do you believe me as the prophet said yes I believe do you believe he say yes I said throw the crotches he said man of God I've been on this crotches for 5 years please how can I throw it okay go with your crotches go with your cres but the other one also be on the line do you believe me to be the Pres yes through the crutches and he threw the cres brother you will not fall that faith will not fall that faith will not com it will never bring you down Hallelujah Lord have faith in God Peter the Brethren they saw the character they saw the the nature they saw the mesiah sign and they were convinced that this is the messiah brother let nobody deceive anybody you must be fully convinced of your testimony what you are talking about if indeed this message is true it is not somebody to tell you it is not me to convince you that it is true the Holy Ghost in you would pimp would let you know that this message is the truth because you are part of it amen hallelujah you are part of it you understand CL and his friend they walk with him they talk with him they had a debate on the road yeah and Jesus look at them he just ped those guys say you fools you are foolish people Jesus just St call them fools he said Master you call us fools we don't understand what you're talking about we don't understand how can a man die and people will bring report that he's alive again we will never take this one we can't take it Abraham is dead he's right there Isaac is dead and this Jesus we we believe that he was the mess but he's also died he also he has G to the r that's the end say you fool said Master you can call us fool you don't understand what you are talking about friends let God address PR Thomas tonight that I'm a fool if I don't see what I supposed to see today he has to manifest himself before us and then we may see God yes sir you understand and when they could not see him re they did right thing Jesus was about to leave them they persuaded him that no you cannot leave us come to our tent came to our ab and when he got in said they Clos the door and when the the doors was shut yeah it was he said it is different it is different from Jesus outside and Jesus inside that's the difference difference he took the bread and he has a special way of breaking it Hallelujah and he did it the same way like we preaching the message the same way preach that's what we preaching the same way the same way of breaking the bread and that is why you will recognize that that is God and when he broke it in that they jump that is the Messiah and he left them Peter also went to fishing he went back brother you cannot run away from that pecularity you canot run away from that responsibility you can run away you can leave this church and go and go you come back if you are then if you PR as a son of brother you go you go and wallow in sin you will stay come out you come and take your place yes sir because the Holy Ghost will not allow you you'll be convicted you be Peter he said I go I go fishing he has left his respon Jesus went to the the shore get him out he said you'll be a fish of a fisher of men but but when Jesus died he went back to fishion but Jesus has to go and fetch him again yes sir he went back again children have you any meat no we never get any how can you get cash when you are running away from your responsibility you will never get catch they not but John said ah Peter that man at the beach there that is Jesus the Bible say Peter threw himself in the water and S M to meet with Jesus brother you must get back to your responsibility Jesus said I did not ask you to go back to don't go back you pray you were called as a Fisher man you fishmen brother there is a special uniqueness with God and his children that is why we are not like denominations we have only one king who is a ruler the Holy Ghost is the ruler of this church that is why a man without the holy ghost that if he has not been behind maybe the desert coming to face and face with the pillar of fire he has got no business here no because it is to the man leading the church is the Holy Ghost he's the leader you understand now at this end time God is sending Malachi 4 why because the churches has they have all all their pecularities has left them Satan has shaved the church he has taken all out out of them but thank God I will send you aijah sir I will send there may be an evening light because sons of God we don't know how to fight in darkness that is where we need the evening light it is evening timeall but God is given us life to accomplish this battle Joshua has to pray Lord I am a stranger I don't know to fight in darkness I cannot fight in darkness if Darkness grip me here I'm defeated say speak to the son yes sir that is why we you have the evening light for us to overcome this battle God loves us that he don't want us to fail because he's not a failure for you to fail either God want us to be Overcomers friends death is nothing because we don't fear death you don't fear anything because we know how God has placed Us in his kingdom yes sir right before the foundations of the world friends your name was put in the L of of life and when the SE were open John could see his name he stretched his head and he saw his name he said no no I need not to weep again he clean the tears from his eyes Hallelujah say glory and say all creation had me shouting Glory and Honor unto the most high Hallelujah May somebody stretch his head tonight the book is open have you recogniz have you seen your name brother if you never seen the book is open your name is right there and when you see your name you know that the inheritance belongs to you and the will has been written your name is there and if your name is there you can make your claim you can make your claim if you are sick the will is there your name is there by his Str I'm Healed claim it have to claim it it is written to you the prophet said it is written to you in the message god making Covenant with his people it is written to you now listen in the message why I cry why I cry 63 0714 T number 0714 paragraph 100 oh it anoints our faith it move us out in the great circles it separates us from other things of the world you see no matter how little we are or how much a minority we are how much we are laugh at made fun of don't make a bit of difference that's all you see there is something within us we were predestinated to see this hour right and there is nothing going to stop us from seeing it here God has spoken it it's already happening you see it oh how we thank God for this then it brings your faith when you see these things happening here when you see the manifestation of God when you see SS when you see people being healed when you see the power of God coming forth to address issues in the church it give you faith that you know God is real is the same yesterday to unchangeable God hallelujah we may see God hallelujah we have to see him you understand we are predestinated to see the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 the Pentecostal cannot see it right because they cannot manifest God but you were ordained to man man go in this age that portion of the scripture belongs to you so I don't need to read Malachi 4 from this book I have to read Mal for here when I see you I see Mal sir why because you restored you are being restored and I see God in you restoration amen he pick you is not replacement he pick you and then he restore you Hallelujah brought you to your former Place Hallelujah to shine the beauty of God glory you understand when you can bring it together we can only see the Mighty God unveil we must bring it together the Mighty God unveil before the for T Number 0629 96 paragra get that tag together let I bring the tag together look what is happening and look what he promised then you will see where we are at get that thing together you can see the unveiling of his great and the Great and the mighty one Traditions has granted the people again to these great things that is being prophesied you can see it but your eyes are open Hallelujah friends it is time for us to really manifest God we are not to really allow anything to slack we don't allow we should not allow anything to to to be contrary to what has been revealed to us we must manifest him Paul he admonished Timothy says study the word and approve yourself 2 Timothy 2:15 study to show thyself approve unto God a Workman that needed not to be ashamed but rightly divided the word of truth but some profan and vain bubling for they will increase unto more ungodliness you see it let it steady so the prophet said you must steady and to bring it together bring it together in a message what should I do with Jesus called Christ 63 1124 1124 paragraph 55 you see God has already got it laid out let the ministry study it let brother brother J study it let brother study it it is already lay out in the Bible you understand let the ministry stud but you see they tell somebody else word about it some group of men they are so blend to the truth when the truth is presented they fail to see it but you see God is do he's got it wrote out there he's got it wrote out right here in the book what is going to happen today so it will be fulfilled but others that is not ordained to see it will never see it oh thank God somebody is seeing it somebody is seeing it Hallelujah you were ordained for this [Music] age you are not here to add to the number you are here to take your place so when you come to church move further and move into Christ otherwise you become a church member jesusall Paul he recognized when he saw the pillar of fire and then he struck him and God wanted to position Paul as a true witness yes sir brother he was not with them in the upper room so when we are talking of witnesses Paul was not one of them the witnesses they came from The Upper Room 120 Witnesses and said before God can put you as a witness God has to train you yes sir God has to train you God has to put his nature in you and put his pecul his his character in you and then God will have confidence in you Paul when he was arrested God placed in him his his nature and he was changed his intellectual fault everything changed and he told his friends the phes I cannot be disobedient let me tell you I was also thinking that righteousness is in the law but I want to tell you I count everything as done to win Christ that is why you have also forsaken everything yes sir otherwise you could have also compet with the world but you you cannot compete with them because you have a good report the Holy Ghost is always constant periodically sending report to your father how you are behaving may God help us we turn the Lord that the Holy Ghost is loose in the Feast of the trumpet say the Holy Ghost is loose at the center yes sir they burn him but he loose so we have our Liberty sons of God we have our Liberty nothing can put us in crotches again nobody can place Us in any crotches we are free Hallelujah to manifest God to Showcase that we are Sons and Daughters of God let the whole world know after all how many years are are we going to live here how many years you know how coming through I'll go to my friend I come to my friend he's gone I asked even of oh no she is also gone brother you see this this home this one is not a better place that is why you should not allow this one to deceive you my friend if you stick to this one you will be deceived and then you will be your name will be written on the earth like Jeremiah said some people their name are written on the Earth but you you have your name written in the books of life God's L book of life therefore look at how this world is terminating everything is going to an end you understand but it looked at people don't want to see to all the events the Realties friends we don't have time again you the youngest see how your face has very smooth face but look at your old ladies look at me old man look at my face I'm going you understand isn't a good place therefore you should not allow this one to deceive us let the in man grow from glory to glory giving glory to God praising God regardless of this one let this one not be a hindrance praise God worship him let his nature be exploded let the people see Christ Hallelujah let them see Jesus yes sir because the prophet said that is God what he said what we want to do we have to do today is to let the people get life life there are people somewhere you go near them you you they will poison you you die because when they speak it is death but some people when they speak it's life yes sir you see it so we must really carry this message to the dying Nation the dying generation said the people are dying we must carry the message to them that is what you are doing I know you are sending missionaries sending money to Russia my brother has been telling me a lot about you what you are doing here in this church God bless you for that if when soul is one it is at your advantage don't be worried when you're doing good things you understand because there is a dying generation when he gave him the staff said take my staff run go and put it on the dead there is a dead boy in my room go and put the stuff on him don't wait for any man don't greet any man you are carrying a message to the dead so don't waste time this is what we have to do we are carrying a message to the dead you should not wait up the world is really hungry the world is sinking but let the bread prove to this world that there is hope Hallelujah in Jesus Christ you understand the people are perishing but we must get the life in the message path of Life the path of Life 62 0621 0621 path of Life parag 102 Jesus said I come that they might have life zo God's own life in them and that's everything that had a beginning has an end it is those things which had no beginning has no end that's right can you tell me you are beginning you you have no beginning you don't have beginning because that eternal life in you did not begin so you don't have an end that is my consolation that's my comfort and know who is sitting in me who is living in me who is who has taken resident in my soul I know him and therefore I'm convinced that I came from God I will go back to God hallelujah you must know where you come from now I've come here maybe about 60 days Mission work I'll go back to Africa I came from Africa I'll will go back to Africa I'm not an American We Came From Heaven we must go back to heaven the reason we have to go to heaven is this world is contaminated God gave us this inheritance he gave this AB in adoption he gave this land to Adam this is Adam's inheritance but why why do we call ourselves strangers from our own land why are we strangers on our own land because it has been contaminated this is not the place to live it is Satan hi in so I call myself a stranger from my own land because this is Str things that we are seeing on this Earth yes but God is going to wipe away all this foolishness and all this sin all these outs everything will wipe away and then you re they be regenerate renovation he will do renovation of this Earth and then we will come to a in our original Place see your pecularity brother you are peculiar why because said God divided himself in the Mage conference he divided himself that you get a portion of God I get a portion of God you get a portion so when we come together what are we going to that we are going to form the pillar of fire again that's what is going on so when we come to God we are forming Pillar of Fire again how can you say that you don't need me it is word upon word when the brick layer when they block brick layer is laying block block upon block block the block oh please don't put this one on me please no no no I cannot carry this block you must carry that block yes sir that is what is we it's word upon word you understand because if I have to be at the bottom I have to be on top I should really Rejoice that I am at the bottom and you supposed to be on top I should not cry oh bro why are you stepping on me you must step on me cuz we are building a building we are building a house for God we'll be closing very soon I have many stuff but I cannot go through I we have to close now bra Brown said in the token let him bring that toen he said now but here it is his own life 63 0901 toen 090 0901 205 but

circumcision without the token you are not even in the Covenant the whole thing works together if you say you are circumcised to the word and it only then you will believe the word if you believe the word then the token has got to come for he said repent and be baptize every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost there you

could never ever out love the I want to live I want to live the way he wants me until no to him I want to love love children just no more love for I could never ever I've asked brother Kenny to try that song again that we were singing right before we turned it over it's very lovely but with end the words so I hope we have the words for that now you know I i' never never heard it said quite like that that God is looking for a people that he can transfer his peculiarity into oh wow what a way to say it that God is peculiar and you know I was looking as brother Thomas was breaking that word down I was following along he was breaking the English word down I was breaking down the Greek word and it was it was quite um quite convoluted I was surprised by it cuz I I thought it was pretty straightforward but it it it's it's kind of like an an action it's almost like it's called you to something or it's called you out from something into something it's all about motion and it is that it's necessary because it's the activity is why you get identified as peculiar and to my surprise the same word is is used brother Aubrey in a devil possessed person because they you'd say wow they act weird they act pear wow that person got a spirit but everybody acts peculiar by one Spirit or the other you're either filled with the spirit of the of the devil or you're filled with the spirit of God and they're peculiar to each other they don't act like you you don't act like them at least you're not supposed to if you have the spirit of God but you are very peculiar to the world and I thought wow W I've never I never have caught that part of it as brother Thomas was saying so we don't come to church to see the flesh we come to see the Holy Ghost in each other and I thought how fitting that is because you being in your flesh don't do me a whole lot of good I can see you at Walmart but to come into the house of God and come together and bring all these little licks of fire he went the list I must have I must have list five or six brand new reasons why we should assemble and be at church amen oh hallelujah amen praise the Lord let's try that again brother K amen [Music]

wow we got to try back some more brother Kenny I don't I don't ever remember hearing that it's quite beautiful I love those words we're going to take these requests up leave your standing where you are sister Emily Curtis says can we remember uh the Yus fames that how you say that sister yeah just okay um oh this there brother shelle's Church in Alabama a young mother oh my goodness passed away

in the morning um then they will they will amputate his pinky toe uh on Friday and brother Brad uh is actually quite trusting over the Lord in the whole thing and uh he's put the whole thing in the Master's hands I think that's a good place to put it and is just asking for our prayer amen join with that person standing near you perhaps let's call on the name of the Lord father we thank you for the word that we heard tonight Lord it g it challenges us father to realize that we this isn't just something we've stumbled into we've been called lord we've been chosen we're a royal priesthood a

Lord that you would touch her these back problems Lord I'm all too familiar with that Lord over the years and you've touched me many times Lord we're thinking of brother Bradley in the morning oh may you be with the team Lord there may that thing be a perfect success they're needing it to be a success Lord I pray your hand of Mercy would be heavily upon that in the morning Lord and it might carry through but Lord yet we're still looking to the Unseen to say father you're well able Lord to fix the whole problem yourself and no procedures would be needed we're just putting it in your hands that's where we want it to be we want it to be in your hands Lord we accept in whatever way you choose to heal our brother we commit these things into your hands Lord bless our dear brother Thomas
