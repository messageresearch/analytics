Father, you gave a five-fold ministry to guide your children. We respect and honor that this morning, Father. Those that are streaming, I pray that you would bless them. And Lord, we pray for our sick and needy this morning, those that are afflicted. We lift them up to you, Father, praying that you would touch their bodies, that you'd heal them, sounding well.

So if y'all could just come right on up after each. Let's give sister Sarah a hand. Amen. the furnace thrown in the lion's den. Left for dead in the dungeon. I face my red sea time and again, but through the trials the Lord has taught me. I won't escape if I complain, but he'll deliver every time. I praise him through the pain. I just come out praising. Stronger than I've ever been. Flying high up there with the eagles on the breeze of a second wind. Oh, anybody can sing and smile, standing in the choir. So Lord, thank you for the song you taught me. In the storm and through the fire, beneath the waves and between the tears, when I should have gone crazy, I just came out praising. I know you're on the brink of giving up and giving in. You're weary and discouraged and tired of trying to understand. But this trial wasn't meant to break you. It only came to make you strong. You might have gone in weak and crying, but you'll come out with a song. You're going to come out praising, stronger than you've ever been. Flying high up there with the eagles on the breeze of a second wind. Oh, anybody can sing and smile. Standing in a choir. So Lord, thank you for the song you taught me. In the storm and through the fire, beneath the waves and beneath the tears, when I should have gone crazy, I just came out crazy. God won't let this trial get the best of me because he said it's only a test for me. I went in broke going to come out wealthy. Went in sick going to come out healthy. Went in bound coming out released. Went in worried but now I got feast. Went in confused but now my mind's brand new. with it complaining, but I'm coming out praising. I'm going to come out crazy, stronger than I've ever been. Flying high up there with the eagles on the breeze of a second wind. Oh, anybody can sing and smile, standing in a choir. So Lord, thank you for the song you taught me. In the storm and through the fire, beneath the waves and beneath the tears, when I should have gone crazy, I just came out praising. Stronger than I've ever been. Flying high up there with the eagles on the breeze of a second wind. Wo! Anybody can sing and smile, standing in a choir. So Lord, thank you for the song you taught me. In the storm and through the fire, beneath the waves, in between the tears, when I could have gone crazy, I just came out crazy. Oh, came out praising. I came out praising. Sister Amber, have you come? Let's get her. Excuse me. Sister Amber, she come. Let's give her a hand. Amen. Peace like a river attendeth my way. When sorrows like sea below roll, whatever my life, thou hast taugh me to Say it is well. It is well with my soul. And it is well with my soul. It is well. It is well with my soul. Though Satan should buff it, though trials should come, let it bless. Let assure us come true that Christ has regarded my helplessness and has shed his own blood for my soul and it is well with my soul. It is well. It is well with my soul and it is well with my soul. It is well. It is well with my soul. Brother Steve, you come. Let's give give him a hand. &gt;&gt; Not even sure if we need to sing anymore. The last one. My goodness. We're almost home. Amen. &gt;&gt; As I look back down the pathway up the mountain, I have trod weary worn and feet a little sore. Thought by now I'd be much further up the road than where I am. I've cast aside some weight. I must do so much more. There's no time to waste my fleeting precious time. &gt;&gt; Setting weight with haste. I will swiftly cast aside. &gt;&gt; No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on. I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost done. Oft gaze across the valley of decision where I was and thank the Lord he led me from that place. The heights I've gained are greater than were all my yesterdays. But I must press on to see my Savior's face. There's no time to waste my fleeting precious time. Be setting weight with haste. I will swiftly cast aside. No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on. I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost home. When I reach those gates of glory, only then will I take rest. But the first thing I will do when I get home, I'll crawl up to my Jesus and I'll weep down at his feet. My source of joy, the savior of my soul. There's no time to waste my fleeting precious time. &gt;&gt; Setting weight with haste. I will swiftly cast aside. No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on. I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost home. There's no time to waste my fleeting precious time. Setting weight with haze. I will swiftly cast aside. No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on. I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost done. I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost home. I can hardly wait. I know. I'm almost home. Amen. Sister Sarah, if you come, let's give her a hand. Sister Sarah Smith. If y'all know the song or you catch the tune and it means something to you, um, by all means join in. We got words. I think your grace and mercy brought me through. live in this moment because of you. I want to thank you and praise you too. Your grace and mercy brought me through. Thank you for saving a sinner like me. You tell the world that salvation is free. Though there were times when I didn't do right, but you watched over me all day and night. Your grace and mercy brought me through. I'm living this moment because of you. I want to thank you and praise you too. Cuz your grace and mercy brought me through. Justice deanded that I should die. But Jesus already paid the price. I once was blind, but now I can see. Cuz your grace and mercy came and rescued me. Your grace and mercy brought me through. I'm living this moment because of you. I want to thank you and praise you too. Cuz your grace and mercy brought me through you. stand to our feet this morning. Greet in the name of the Lord and happy to have you all in the house of God this morning. Got a number of visitors. Brother Paul, good to see you. Minister Simone, welcome. Amen. Brother Jack has some friends here with him today. want to make them feel welcome. Just uh feel welcome in the camp of the king. Amen. We have the shout of the king among us and we're not afraid to let people know it. I sure appreciate all that good singing and worship and specials. Amen. Want to turn into our text today to Luke chapter 14. And um appreciate you being out on this rainy day. You still got a number of people who are just battling that time of year and flu and things going around. But um Amen. Brother Jack and I were talking this morning. We're going to keep praying for sister Kathy. She's still real weak. I said, "But brother Jack, the devil ain't nobody." He still ain't nobody. Amen. I thought, "Brother Jack going to come through the phone on me." Amen. Amen. That's the truth. Not saying he's not real. Don't you ever think that. But when we say that, it just simply means he has no authority over our lives. He makes no decisions. &gt;&gt; You just remember that. I don't care what you're going through. Satan has no jurisdiction to make decisions about your life. &gt;&gt; My life, my times, as David said, are in God's hands. &gt;&gt; God, my father's alone. And so, whatever my father allows to come my way, I'll just uh follow Peter's instructions and I won't even think it's strange. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn around and shake hands with somebody standing near you. Say, "God bless you. Happy to have you in the house of the Lord." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Want to take the sixth and what I think will be the final installment in our series on demonology in the spiritual realm. And um I really don't want to let me let me say what I want to do and what I don't want to do. What I would like to do today is just take a very methodical uh um kind of and I know people are going to brother Paul, you're going to hear them. They're going to laugh at me because they know I'm not good at that. I get preaching and I forget that I want to go slow. Amen. But it just gets delicious and I just can't Amen. I just uh get excited. Amen. But I love it. I love the word and I love what it's done in my life and I'm grateful to God. I was this morning pulling my Bible out of my briefcase and just held it over my heart and said, "Lord, what would I do if you hadn't revealed this to me and opened this book? Oh my goodness, I'd just be in line with 33,000 other different versions of the gospel. I'm glad to know that we have the revealed word in this hour." And uh he didn't have to open my eyes as brother Leno sings. He could have easily passed me by. &gt;&gt; The age I was living in was wretched poor and blind. But I heard recognizing your day. &gt;&gt; Serpent seed, perfect faith, the breach, and the message of grace. Lord, I thank thee. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. So, we're going to take this today, and I u what I what I don't want to do is is rehearse and recount what we've learned already. We've learned quite a bit in this series and it's all been practical instructions on how to live an overcoming life. So, go back and catch the series. It'll put strength in you. I promise you, it's helped me a lot and I've had a good bit of feedback, amen, from around the world, people enjoying it. And I have enjoyed it. Amen. It's meant a lot to me. I'm grateful to the Lord for it. And you know it's um there there's a method a real scriptural way to overcome in this world and overcome you must. Amen. Now the Lord has already overcome and given you the chance to overcome. Without him doing that you wouldn't even have a chance. But there's things in our lives the prophet taught us that he's not going to overcome that for you. You're going to have to overcome it. He'll help you. He'll stand behind his promises. How many know that his promises are yay and amen? &gt;&gt; And he will keep all of his promises. I've never seen a promise of God fail. I've had God fulfilling his promises in way in ways I didn't expect &gt;&gt; and ways I didn't understand. &gt;&gt; But it, you know, didn't take too long downstream to look back and go, "Yeah, he was right. Of course, he was right." You know, all along he knew father truly knew best. And I I wouldn't I wouldn't trade it because uh it's made me what I am. And uh you have been made for this hour, this moment, friends. It's crossing over time. And the ages have uh been, you know, we're at the consummation of all things. He only had seven stars in his right hand. &gt;&gt; There were only seven lampstands that the son of God was walking in the midst of. Friends, there's not coming another one. You are the last generation that will ever be on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we are the final voice to the final age. And so I want to run my race well. I want to I want to hit every target. I want to I want to do it well. I want to go forward and be successful. Not in a s not not in pride. The more victorious I am, the more humility I feel because I'm aware. And we would all say at times we are painfully aware that if he had not left us a seed, we too would be allto together like unto Sodom and Gomorrah. So it's all about him and we're grateful for that. God bless you today. So I I want to stay methodical. I don't want to have to rehearse all the different things um that we've learned. I want to uh come to these last thoughts that have been on my heart. Now, Luke chapter 14 and verse uh 16. I'm not going to be able to read Luke out of Hosea, that's for sure. Amen. Luke 14:16- 24. Oh, and there's other I think I've greeted my visitors. God bless you. We're happy to have you today. Luke 14:16- 24. Then said he unto him, "A certain man made a great supper, and bade many, and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come, for all things are now ready." And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground and I must need to go see it. I pray thee have me excused. My business is just more important than my soul. &gt;&gt; I was just reading between the lines there. Sorry. And another said, I have bought five yolk of oxen and I go to prove them. I pray thee, have me excused. And another said, I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come. So that servant came and showed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said unto said to his servant, "Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city." See, it had to be quickly because this is the end time. The scriptures is being personified right now in real time. Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind. And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou has commanded, and yet there is room. And the Lord said unto the servant, "Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in that my house may be filled. For I say unto you, that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper. Um, for those of you who are tape listeners, you'll recognize that as brother Brandham's text for, is your life worthy of the gospel. Let's pray. Master, we're thanking you for this time now to come to your word. We're grateful for all of the gathering of the people and the songs and the worship. Now we come to that most important part and that is the delivery of eternal life through the preaching of the word. There is nothing more important. Lord, I pray that you will give us hearing hearts today and help me now be with my heart and mind as I try to come to these po points. I don't want to miss even one of them, Lord. I don't have many, but they're vital. And I want to fully um fully delve in and and so that I can communicate the burden you've laid on my heart, a burden of the word for the people. Lord, may it be so. I commit it to you. I commit myself into your hands for the sake of your kingdom and all things, Lord, of your word in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you, friends. You can be seated. Gideon, if you'll give me um St. John chapter 15, I want to look at a couple of verses there. Some time back, we preached on on abiding in Christ. And not going to go back today. I felt tempted to go back and pull up some points from that. It was such a really for for last year, it was one of the hallmarks for me of all the things I preached on. Amen. Abiding in Christ was so important to me personally. Seemed to help a lot of people and I was so grateful for that. But I resisted that today because I'm just not going to let myself get pulled away from the material I I'm determined to cover today. And I believe the Lord will help me because I believe I'm following his leadership. But St. John 15 is an easy passage for me to turn to because St. John 15 and St. John 17 are probably certainly my favorite passages in the all the gospels. St. John 17 may be my favorite chapter in the entire Bible. Um if if there's other ones there, they're they're real close there. But St. John 17 because he Jesus was praying for me there he was praying for you praying said I pray not for the world but those thou hast given me. See and so thine they were. See and thou gavest them me and I have gave them thy word. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Here I go. Okay, calm down. Let me &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. St. John 15 verse one. I am the true vine. So if he if he's a true one, there's got to be false ones. &gt;&gt; That's the first thing. I want to avoid the false ones. &gt;&gt; I want the true one. Problem is there's a lot of false ones. &gt;&gt; There's only one true one. &gt;&gt; See, so I can tell you today, what are your odds of finding it? Less than zero. &gt;&gt; Except he left us a seed. Except the Holy Spirit revealed himself to you and I, there'd be no chance for you to find it. See, I am the true vine, and my father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away, and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. So when you bring forth a lot of fruit, he's not going to send you on vacation. He's going to purge you so you bring forth even more fruit. I promise you'll be happy for it on the other side. &gt;&gt; You won't think you've missed out on the other side. It's the world that's going to miss out. &gt;&gt; He purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit. Now ye are clean. Catch this third verse. Here's the whole reason I wanted to look at St. John 15. Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken to you. We've told you so many times and proved it throughout the scriptures that we that a man is born again by the spirit of God and that gives him right standing with God. You understand? and and no man from Genesis to Revelation or all through the church history, no man or woman ever found right standing in the presence of God by denying part of his word. &gt;&gt; So the only way you will ever come to a right standing and be justified as though you never sinned in the first place and filled with the Holy Ghost is you will say amen to every word. And that is how the new birth comes. You're born again by the spirit that comes through the word of God. We've proven that so many times over and over again. You're clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. Brother Diggs did some wonderful speaking of the word to us Wednesday night. And I I was watching the Lord give a lot of people a lot of needs. I had a list of needs. He gave them to me. He gave them to you. I was thankful that the Lord was handing out. Amen. and and coming by and handing out handfuls of blessing and purpose and keeping his word. And I've had testimonies already uh some pretty miraculous ones. Um you know uh my my own wife and my own daughter-in-law said that when brother Diggs this isn't this isn't sensationalism. This is just actually real that when brother Diggs came by and preaching and took them by the hand, my wife said it felt like electricity went from all down to her bottom of her feet. Sister Rachel said the exact same thing. Never felt anything like that in their life. And the Lord was meeting the need that they had. &gt;&gt; He's not here as a circus to show off. That's not what he is. This isn't Barnam and Bailey. We're not We don't chase sensations. But I do know that he keeps his word. &gt;&gt; And I do know that signs follow the believers. And I do know that devils run when when the word goes forward and and people believe it. So I, you know, and I I know that the Lord was delivering a lot of people of a lot of things and cleaning you up by the word. See, you're washed clean by the washing of the water of the word. &gt;&gt; But I want to just make a statement that I'm going to circle back to later. I don't want to get in the trenches of it yet, but I want you to understand that that Satan knows how to retreat. &gt;&gt; He knows how to survive to fight another day. That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. I just want that in your mind so that now you are clean. But when he goes into dry places, if he comes back and finds that area that he used to occupy in your life, I'm talking about believers, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Where he occupied things in your life and hel held sway over you AND GOD CLEANED YOU AND DROVE HIM OFF. I'm here to tell you, you better fill that up with Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Whatever whatever you'll empty out of the world and and Christ will come in and fill up that spot. If you don't do that, Satan knows how to survive &gt;&gt; to fight another day." See, this is this is what what what Legion did. I have little doubt that he, you know, he every time that he didn't fill it up with the right things and the enemy came back and every time it got worse and worse until finally he crossed the Rubicon and he couldn't come back it from it anymore. And it's like the the the proverbial snowball rolling down the hill and you can hold it back for a while, but after a while it gets so big you can't hold it back anymore. I'm here to tell you something, friends. That's a miserable life for a believer. Let the Holy Spirit cleanse your heart and fill up with the spirit of God and you can have victory from from this day forward all the way TO THE RAPTURE. THAT'S WHAT I WANT. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm a Christian because I want to enjoy his life. So he says in that third verse, you are you you are clean through the word which I've spoken to you. SO NOW QUITE NATURALLY HIS NEXT WORD WOULD BE abide in me and I in you. What else do you think he would say? See you're clean through the word. Now abide in me &gt;&gt; and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine. No more can you except you abide in me. So the third verse from the amplified says that ye are cleansed and pruned already because of the word which I have given you the teachings I have discussed with you. Dwell in me and I will dwell in you. Live in me and I will live in you. &gt;&gt; Thank God. IS &gt;&gt; THAT A BEAUTIFUL PROMISE? AND YOU KNOW these disciples at this moment are not yet even converted by the Holy Ghost but they are believers &gt;&gt; AND JESUS HAS BREATHED on them POTENTIALLY GIVING THEM THE HOLY GHOST. IT YOU KNOW AND SAYING RECEIVE YOU THE HOLY GHOST AND THEY'RE BELIEVING. &gt;&gt; So they're clean through THE WORD. AND SO NOW HE'S SAYING YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE ALREADY CLEANED. You're already pruned. YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO COME TO MORE. THE HOLY GHOST WASN'T YET GIVEN AT THAT MOMENT, BUT THIS IS THE RECIPE FOR AN overcomer's life. Um, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. I can tell you that if you do this, you'll succeed. And if you don't, you won't. Full stop. Amen. &gt;&gt; At whatever level you do not surrender out of your life and FILL THAT UP WITH CHRIST, Satan will doggedly dog you and have control of that and he WILL NEVER BE SATISFIED. HE'LL GO FOR MORE AND MORE INCHES AND MORE AND inches turn to feet and feet turn to yards AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW HE'S GOT MILES &gt;&gt; OF YOUR LIFE AND HE'LL STAY THERE FOR YEARS. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's a miserable place for a child of God. &gt;&gt; You are cleansed already. You're pruned already. There is, and this is all part of demonology in the spiritual realm. I'm I'm giving you the tactics how the spirit of God works, how the spirit of the Antichrist works. There is a vast distance between and I'm really going to go slow on this one because I want it so clear because I'm speaking about the greatest existential threat to the human race. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's not a more important topic than what I'm about to go into. What I'm about to go into is the difference between you making a rapture or going into annihilation in the tribulation period. Can you think of a more important subject? &gt;&gt; There's a vast distance between being converted and being reformed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when I say reformed, that's not to be confused with the reformation era of Martin Luther in the Sardisian age, which by the way produced a new birth at that time. &gt;&gt; You understand the whole premise of the reformation movement that Luther led and others. It wasn't just Luther. He was the spearhead of it. Just like in brother Brandham's day, he was the spearhead. He was the voice to that age. Luther, you know, um the the whole premise was was not to create a new man-made church system. That's not what Luther was trying to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was not trying to create a man-made church system. Today, we have north of 33,000 versions of the single true vine gospel. 33 north of. That's the That's an old count. I've heard new counts that say it's approaching 40,000 of denominations and indep various independent Christian societies and organizations. And even when they call themselves independent, they're anything but. So the whole premise of it was not to make a man-made church system, but in Luther's mind, he was trying to take the church back to the original word, to the original church. Now you you and you can and I and I did a lot of reading because I wanted to read it in his own words. I didn't just want to take some historian's word for it. I went back and actually pulled up Luther's sermons and I have them in my library and I have access to them and I spent a lot of time just reading it word for word and I've got a couple of quotes from brother Luther himself. And so I everything I'm saying I can prove by his own writings and his own sermons. Uh Martin Luther has a sermon uh on Pentecost, Acts chapter 2. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And you can actually go online and read it. And it's and it's translated from his German language. And and I did I did I did do some reading of it. So So I want to I want to make that clear. The spirit of restoration was falling on Martin Luther. That was the first stage in a four- stage restoration of the bride tree. &gt;&gt; You understand? It went down uh from those first ages. And that first, you know, uh spirit of that lion anointing and that white and that white horse and that spirit uh you know of the lion carried through all the way through, you know, through in uh through the first three church ages. Brother Brandham taught us this. And then you find going into that fourth, leaving the third, going into the fourth. Now they're going to enter dark ages and Satan is switching his rider. Now he's going to red. He's going to start slaughtering them wholesale. And then from there they're going to go into a thousand years of dark ages and he's going to get on a black horse and and God is going to come, you know, uh at the at the beginning of Sardis and he's going to begin to restore it back. So Luther is actually not trying to start a new denomination. HE'S HE JUST CAME OUT OF THAT. THOUSAND YEARS OF DARK AGES OF THAT. &gt;&gt; SO HE'S NOT TRYING TO DO THAT. HE'S TRYING TO restore us back to the original. NOW HE DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE PIECES. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have all THE REVELATION. A SEAL PARTIALLY OPENED. A mystery dropped down and a messenger caught it and ran with it. But it's IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND IT'S ALL PART OF THE PACKAGE OF restoration starting to work. So to to YOU KNOW HIS IDEA IS TO TAKE THE CHURCH BACK under the control and guidance of the Holy Ghost. But as so many times in history, brother Brandham dealt with this when that leader goes off the scene men get in there and it doesn't take many generations after that. You can see it in history. subsequent generations of followers manage to they they manage over time to sever the movement from the vine again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Turning it into a eventually a mere denomination. AND AND EVEN SO-CALLED, AS I'VE said already, even so-called independent Christian movements at the end of the day are still just man-made religious organizations that produce reform. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I've already told you there's a big distance between conversion and reformation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they're trying to reform. Now, that can seemingly be a good thing. and because reformed to you know positive reformation in your life uh I DON'T SAY THAT'S A BAD THING BUT THAT'S NOT the new birth &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; necessarily &gt;&gt; when you present a version of the gospel that seeks to merely improve or you know to to to try to produce an improved person &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; or a reformed armed person, but but it downplays or completely disregards uh a thorough NEW BIRTH BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY Ghost for a real conversion. &gt;&gt; That is the not a that is the trap of the antichrist at the end time. THERE'S NO SUBJECT MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU than the one I'm speaking of right now &gt;&gt; because there are there are thousands and tens of thousands of pull pits that just limit their ministry. Fine people, not again AN IMPROVED PERSON, A SOMEWHAT REFORMED PERSON. YOU KNOW, I WAS TALKING TO A GUY ONE TIME. HE'S ACTUALLY A FRIEND OF MINE. WORKED FOR MY DAD ON HIS CREW AND I was running that crew and and you know HE HE HAD STARTED GOING TO CHURCH AND UH YOU KNOW I WAS WITNESSING TO HIM AND SOME DIFFERENT THINGS AND I FINALLY SAID SOMETHING HE DIDN'T like and he LOOKED AT ME DEAD IN MY EYE HE SAID LISTEN Jason you need to understand I'm just a reformed thug and I and I'm only going to take you saying so much to me I was like wow I didn't even know I was offending you much less, you know, you're going to go full thug on me and I'm going to end up in a scrap. Now, I like a good scrap, but I didn't want He was larger than me and I wasn't all too sure I could survive. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you do that, when you downplay or eliminate THE HOLY GHOST COMING IN for a real conversion, then why that's so deadly is that opens A PERSON UP TO accepting a religious spirit. THAT AND THAT RELIGIOUS SPIRIT AND BECAUSE OF THEIR improvements and reformations makes them feel like that they are okay TO JUST BE A BETTER PERSON. &gt;&gt; But Jesus said you must be born again. &gt;&gt; Your first birth is no good and you CAN'T UNDO IT BY BEING GOOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. The spirit of God has to be allowed by you into your heart and change you into a new creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; REVELATION 3:20, "BEHOLD, I STAND AT the door and knock." This is an end time prophecy. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him &gt;&gt; AND WILL S WITH HIM and he with me. So this is going to be fellowship. This is the mystery of God, not a doctrine. This mystery wants fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, AND AND SO SO LET ME LET ME JUST SAY IT TO YOU LIKE THIS SO THAT YOU KNOW THERE WE WE WE just cut to the chase. BEHOLD, I STAND AT YOUR HEART TODAY. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And I'm knocking. &gt;&gt; If you will OPEN THE DOOR TO YOUR HEART, I'LL COME in you and live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU BECOME, AS PAUL SAID, a new creation. You become, AS WILLIAM BRANDHAM SAID, A BRAND NEW UNIT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU'RE SCOURED OUT BY THE FIERY BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT fell in THE UPPER ROOM AT PENTECOST. THE SAME ONE, &gt;&gt; NOT A DIFFERENT ONE. THE SAME ONE. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF THAT SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD DWELL IN YOU, IT'LL also quicken your mortal body. &gt;&gt; This is important. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Luther explicitly taught that the that the CHRISTIAN UH PENTECOST IN IN THE SECOND CHAPTER of Acts according TO LUTHER IT STANDS AND I DIDN'T KNOW THIS UNTIL I REALLY READ IT. I WHEN I WHEN I FIRST BEGAN TO READ SOME OF THESE THINGS I THOUGHT MY I DIDN'T I'm going to have to go REALLY LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT what I understood and I HAD ALREADY SPENT YEARS reading through his writings. But it BUT IT BUT THE CLAIM WAS THAT LUTHER CLAIMED THAT THE CHRISTIAN PENTECOST IN ACTS TWO STANDS IN A DELIBERATE CONTRAST. NOW THAT MAKES SENSE to me. IT STANDS IN A DELIBERATE CONTRAST UH TO THE OLD TESTAMENT PENTECOST AT SINAI BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE IT STARTED. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THAT STARTED UNDER THAT PENTECOST THEY GOT A LAW. &gt;&gt; You understand? SO, SO, SO THAT THAT SO THAT SO THAT WHAT WAS GIVEN IN THE UPPER ROOM ACCORDING TO MARTIN Luther was a NEW LAW OF A DIFFERENT KIND, NOT a replacement code of commandments. &gt;&gt; BUT THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT WAS TO BE WRITTEN in their heart. YEAH. &gt;&gt; YEAH. I HOPE YOU'RE GRASPING. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE FIRST FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE RESTORATION of the bride. &gt;&gt; LUTHER WANTED THAT CLEAR FROM THE START. AND AND AND AND THAT WAY NOW THAT WE'VE COME SINCE LUTHER IN THE 1500S AND HERE WE ARE IN THE 21ST CENTURY AND ALL OF THAT IS ALMOST GONE AND WATERED DOWN AND IT'S ALL JUST REFORMATION AND IMPROVEMENT and self assessment AND SELF-HELP AND BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE ORIGINAL RESTORATION WAS ABOUT. &gt;&gt; SEE, it was to BE A NEW LAW OF THE SPIRIT WRITTEN IN OUR HEART. IN HIS PENTECOST SERMON ON ACTS 2, Luther actually says that the that the Jewish Pentecost originally commemorated the giving of the law through Moses, but that Christians celebrate Pentecost because of a new covenant. Now, Paul taught that. That's exactly right. SO, SO THE SO THEN, so then he and I'm quoting him now. THIS IS A DIRECT QUOTE FROM HIS SERMON PENTECOST, Acts 2. The Holy Spirit came in accordance with Christ's promise and gave them a new law. WE NOW CELEBRATE THIS FEAST NOT BECAUSE OF THE OLD HISTORICAL EVENT, BUT BECAUSE of the new one, the sending of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Close quote. Martin Luther. &gt;&gt; For Luther, THE CONTRAST WAS SHARP. NOT ONLY SHARP BUT INTENTIONAL AND VERY DELIBERATE. SINAI ACCORDING TO LUTHER WAS WAS A LAW WRITTEN ON STONE THAT PRODUCED FEAR AND ACCUSATION AND DEATH. BUT BUT BUT BUT ACCORDING TO LUTHER THE JERUSALEM PENTECOST IN ACTS TWO THAT LAW WAS WRITTEN ON OUR HEARTS PRODUCING A LIFE OF JOY AND willing obedience. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the danger AND THE GREAT DECEPTION OF THE DAY IS PREACHING A VERSION OF THE GOSPEL THAT ONLY reforms people somewhat on the outside. &gt;&gt; They sit in man-made systems of religion. SOME OF THEM VERY FINE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; That's why we still preach. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Matt JUST BUILT US A NEW WEBSITE. WE'RE TRYING TO REACH OUT TO THE WORLD AND SAY, "HEY, YOU'RE IN A TRAP." SEE, &gt;&gt; THEY SIT IN THESE MAN-MADE SYSTEMS OF RELIGION THINKING THEY ARE OKAY. YOU KNOW, BROTHER JASON, WHAT is what is man-made religion? And I THAT'S A VALID QUESTION. AND I HAD TO THINK ABOUT THAT. You know, LET LET ME JUST SAY IT LIKE THIS WAY. LET ME SAY IT LIKE THIS. It's manufactured. &gt;&gt; It's synthetic. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's human caused. Not God caused &gt;&gt; God never organized like that. &gt;&gt; It's even at Sinai he didn't do that. It's God it's THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR is God caused not human caused. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you know it it it what happens when it's manufactured OR IT'S SYNTHETIC OR IT'S A HUMANCAUSED SYSTEM OF RELIGION. UH WHICH IS ALWAYS AS BROTHER BRENNHAM SAID A PAINTED FIRE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T GET warmed by it. &gt;&gt; Uh but it's an impersonation OF TRUE WORSHIP AND IT CAUSES AN IMPERSONATION OF CHRISTIANITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID THE DAY IS COMING WHEN THEY WORSHIP THEY THAT WORSHIP ME MUST WORSHIP in spirit and truth. It's the ONLY KIND OF WORSHIP THE FATHER CAN ACCEPT. THERE IS A VAST OTHER KIND. THE BIBLE SAYS THAT IN VAIN DO THEY worship me teaching for doctrine, &gt;&gt; THE HUMAN CAUSED SYNTHETIC MANUFACTURED GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO WHY IS THIS THE GREATEST EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO the survival of the human race? Because it is the very thing that will destroy civilization in the tribulation period. It's Antichrist disguised as authentic Christianity. &gt;&gt; If the book of Revelation is to be believed, &gt;&gt; there were to be many lying wonders &gt;&gt; that fooled the people. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I touched on this last Sunday because don't don't get fooled by lying wonders because Satan is able to produce tremendous amounts of emotion from people &gt;&gt; and things can seem very exciting &gt;&gt; and you know you're not just coming to church. I mean that's not even a lot of times in the modern day that's not even the vibe anymore. It's a it's a concert vibe. &gt;&gt; It's a show. And and that's what it it's entertainment. &gt;&gt; I'm not after that kind of a vibe. &gt;&gt; I want a church that's on fire for the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; I WANT A CHURCH THAT BELIEVES THE BAREFISTED WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; I WANT A CHURCH THAT LOOKS TO GOD TO KEEP HIS PROMISE. AND HE DOES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO THERE'S ALL KINDS OF EXCITABLE THINGS THAT ARE LYING wonders and and vast numbers gather into the tens of thousands and satellite and people crying and and even miracles as brother Matt SMITH WAS SAYING TODAY MIRACLES OPERATE BECAUSE OF FAITH. IT'S IT DOESN'T INDICATE THAT THAT THAT THAT YOUR DOCTRINE is true THAT AND AND IN FACT IS IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION THAT the the PART OF THE ANTICHRIST system fools the world OR ACTUALLY CO coerces the WORLD INTO FOLLOWING THE ANTICHRIST BECAUSE IT COULD BRING FIRE DOWN OUT OF HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THAT'S WHAT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DESERTS OF NEW MEXICO AND OVER JAPAN. THE UNITED STATES BROUGHT FIRE DOWN OUT OF HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said that was that was the uh nuclear bombs. And we're the first ones. I shouldn't say that. WE WERE NOT THE FIRST ones to invent a nuke. Brother Matthew found out that Sodom and Gomorrah got nuked. &gt;&gt; Wow. They had a heat event that can only be equaled in with atomic uh fusion &gt;&gt; and and and it literally they thought it WAS GLAZING ON POTTERY AND AND THE LABS not glazing. This is this is SOMETHING THAT IS CAUSED BY AN INTENSE HEAT EVENT A SUDDEN SHOCKING ELEVATION IN HEAT AND THEY SAID well what what kind OF TEMPERATURE LIKE THE SUN POSSIBLY COULD CAUSE THAT ONLY A NUCLEAR BOMB. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; These things aren't accidents. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is constantly giving the world signs. He's always done that. He never brings judgment without first warning. OH MY GOODNESS. LET'S RUN TO THE SAFETY IN THE cliff of the rock today. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF lying wonders that the world can get you to thinking, "Oh, this is okay." BECAUSE YOU SEE ALL THE EMOTION and you see the you you could sit in that AND FEEL THE VIBE AND IT CAN FEEL VERY EMOTIONAL AND YOU FIND YOUR OWN SELF UH THRILLED AND CRYING. DON'T GET DUPED BY LYING WONDERS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The only wonder I'm looking for that's not a lie is something that will change my life. &gt;&gt; And if it won't do that, then it's just a lying wonder. It's a trap that billions will fall for. If the book of Revelation is to be believed, all the nations and religions of the entire world worship the beast system. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what religion they are. They don't even have to be Christian. &gt;&gt; You understand? Doesn't matter what government they are or what kind. It doesn't matter if they're a communist, socialist, capitalist. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter if they're if they're a a a leading nation or a small tiny island. Doesn't matter if they're Christian, Buddhist, or what? THE ENTIRE WORLD ACCORDING IF THE BOOK OF REVELATION IS TO BE BELIEVED. &gt;&gt; NOW, if you don't believe it, then I'm not sure why you're here today. But I believe it. Right. &gt;&gt; And if the book of revelation is to be believed, then all the nations of all the world and all the religions worship the beast system of a false Christian religion and EVEN GIVE THEIR POWER TO IT FOR ONE PROPHETIC hour just before the whole thing suffers a global annihilation of all living things. The tribulation ends with an extermination event of the entire human race. That's the system that threatens the world. It's why I've never understood why people want to spend valuable time. Time is precious. It's more precious than money. You can lose money and get more. You lose time, you can't get it back. &gt;&gt; You can't save it. You you're you're you're spending it whether you want to or not. &gt;&gt; It's not replenishable. And so that's why I've cashed in and went for eternal life. &gt;&gt; I want the kind that didn't start. And since it didn't start, it doesn't end. &gt;&gt; I don't just want endless time. I want eternity. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, SO SO WE REALIZE THEN that you know this this great system that is destroying the world and I don't want to just keep going down that but I I was going to say and I just want to say it briefly because it's not worth my time talking about it more very much at all other than to just mention how ridiculous that people would spend time lots of it building websites and YouTubetubes attacking a message that they already know makes people into the image of Christ. &gt;&gt; And they already know a faithful servant who was thought faithful around the world his entire life and never suffered an accusation. &gt;&gt; And they spent all THEIR TIME ATTACKING THAT and and you say, "Oh, here you go again." No, no, I'm not going to talk about that because I don't care about that. What bothers me is, and I said it to their face, what bothers me is, you know what the real threat to the world is, and I don't see you spending one minute, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; telling the world about the beast system and Rome and and America and Revelation 13, AND YOU KNOW IT. You preached it. &gt;&gt; You know IT FITS IN THE BIBLE. AND I'LL HEAR YOU WARNING THE WORLD AT ALL. I guess you can't BECAUSE YOU'VE JOINED IN WITH THEM. SO, IF YOU TURN AROUND AND WARN THEM, YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE POT CALLING THE CATTLE BLACK. AND I Okay, I GET IT. I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU THAT YOU CAN'T TAKE THE WHOLE UNADULTERATED WORD. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU CAN HAVE THIS WORLD. GIVE ME JESUS. &gt;&gt; GIVE ME THIS WORD. I'LL STAND BY MYSELF IF I HAVE TO. I JUST WANT HIM AND HIS WORD AND HIS LIFE. AND I WANT ALL OF IT NO MATTER WHAT IT COSTS ME. How could I not love a God who who has followed me all the surely goodness followed me all the days of my life? &gt;&gt; Even when I was running from him as a rebel and he chased me down. I don't know. DID HE TRIP ME? DID HE KNOCK ME DOWN? DID HE KNOCK ME OUT? HE MIGHT HAVE DID ALL THE ABOVE. ALL I KNOW IS WHEN I CAME TO, I WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON. &gt;&gt; AND I'VE NEVER BEEN SORRY. I'M ONLY SORRY I RAN SO FAST IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. &gt;&gt; And then HE HE STILL FOLLOWS ME IN SPITE OF ALL MY FAILURES WHEN I WOULD HAVE KICKED ME TO THE CURB SO LONG AGO. AND HE JUST KEEPS RENEWING ME DAY BY DAY, DAY BY DAY. HE KEEPS FORGIVING ME. HE KEEPS CLEANSING ME OF ALL UNRIGHTEOUSNESS. HOW COULD I NOT LOVE A GOD LIKE THAT? &gt;&gt; HOW WOULD I NOT DEDICATE MY LIFE TO IT? AMEN. &gt;&gt; AS MUCH OF A FAILURE AS I FEEL, HOW WOULD I NOT AT least try? &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE SAID in these systems, these synthetic manufactured human-caused systems, you say, "Can the spirit of God STILL BREAK IN ON THAT system and rescue his child from it? CAN HE STILL BREAK IN AND REVEAL HIS WORD AND LEAD THEM OUT to a true new birth?" OF COURSE HE CAN FOR NOW &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU KNOW FOR NOW WHILE THE BRIDE IS STILL HERE AND AND THE MESSAGE OF GRACE IS STILL GOING OUT. BUT BUT BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING FRIENDS WHEN WHEN THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS THE HOLY GHOST true to his promise LEADS THEM SWIFTLY OUT OF THAT TRAP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He doesn't leave THEM IN THAT TRAP. WHAT KIND OF SALVATION WOULD THAT BE? RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SEE, &gt;&gt; he leads them SWIFTLY OUT OF THAT trap into the further light of the hour. That's always the Bible pattern. That's always That's always the Bible pattern. &gt;&gt; Amen. when the Jews, the devout Jews &gt;&gt; at came FOR THE FEAST OF PENTECOST INTO Jerusalem and Peter AND THEY HEARD PETER'S SERMON IN ACTS CHAPTER 2 AS AN INDICTMENT MESSAGE blistered them. And when IT PRICKED THEIR HEARTS AND THEY THEY SAID, "WHAT MUST WE DO? YOU MUST REPENT." And and and they and they were FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND BAPTIZED AND ADDED TO THE CHURCH. I'LL PROMISE YOU THAT THEY THEY DIDN'T RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST TO BE SENT HOME AND CONTINUE TO BE DEVOUT JEWS. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE INDUCTED INTO THE FAMILY OF GOD AND BECAME PART OF THE FAMILY OF God &gt;&gt; and and in THE RANKS OF THE REDEEMED. WHEN PAUL MET APOLLOS IN ACTS CHAPTER 19, YOU KNOW, WHEN PAUL GAVE HIM THE CORRECT WORD, HE DIDN'T HE DIDN'T LEAVE. APOLLOS DIDN'T LEAVE THERE AND STAY A FOLLOWER OF JOHN'S MESSAGE AND JOHN'S BAPTISM, &gt;&gt; BUT HE HE ACCEPTED THE REVELATION OF THE WORD, BECAME BAPTIZED AND FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND SUBJECTED HIMSELF TO THE PROPHET OF HIS AGE, ST. PAUL, AND ALL THE OTHER APOSTLES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE BIBLE DOESN'T SAY IN REVELATION 18, "STAY IN HER, MY PEOPLE, AND BE a partaker of her sins." BUT THE VOICE THAT ECHOED FROM HEAVEN SAID, "COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE." &gt;&gt; ONLY HIS PEOPLE WILL COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE, THAT YOU AND BE NOT A PARTAKER OF HER SINS, THAT YOU DO NOT PARTAKE OF HER DESTRUCTION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Brother Matt sent me one of the items on the website that he's built for us and had so many compliments on it already. It's still being tweaked and and edited. So, just bear with us. We're trying to get it perfect. It's very close to that now. We still got to add a live link for those who are streaming. So hopefully you're getting through the YouTube live or the Facebook live, but we're going to have a link there. But he said, "Hey, Dad, I want you to take A LOOK AT THIS TOPIC OF transformation from Romans 12:2, and um here's here's a here's a scaffolding. Here's a a loose loose wording just just as a foundation, and I want you to take it and and do that thing you do and and give it back to me. I want to put it on the website." So I did. And I even sent him another edit this morning to say, "Hey, add this in front of that word." Words are important. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you can't believe in all the the the the published work that I've had over the years on the internet, sometimes a single sentence will take me days and I'll change it 50 times because I want the wording perfect &gt;&gt; and I and I'm and I I've never reached perfection in it yet, but I'm I'm I love striving &gt;&gt; for it. Romans 12:2 and be not conformed to this world. How many say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Now, here's a port an important point that I've made numerous times and I keep making it. Paul is talking to people who are born of the spirit. &gt;&gt; He's not down in in the honky tonks preaching to drunkards. &gt;&gt; This is to the church. Be not conformed to this world, but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good. Thank you, Gideon. An acceptable and perfect will of God. So, I wrote this and you'll read it um when the edit this morning is put in. More than an outward reform or religious behavior, transformation is an inward change brought about by the life of Christ in the believer. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; A transformation that begins with the new birth. When a person is truly born again, they are a new creation possessing the very spirit of Christ who changes their desires, attitudes, and character from the inside out. &gt;&gt; This new birth continues its work. And that was an important addition that I added in. This new birth continues its work. The new birth is a is a is an experience. &gt;&gt; You don't slowly get born again. You're either born again or you're not born again. &gt;&gt; But at the SAME TIME, IT'S NOT NOW YOU'RE BORN AGAIN. SEE YOU IN THE RAPTURE. The Holy Spirit now BEGINS A LIFETIME WORK OF you coming into the image in every area of your life. THE NEW BIRTH SENDS YOU WAY DOWNSTREAM. CHANGES YOU INTO A NEW CREATION. GIVES YOU THE ABILITY TO BELIEVE EVERY WORD OF GOD, EVEN THE ONES YOU DON'T KNOW YET. &gt;&gt; I got a point to make about that in a second. A TRANSFORMATION THAT BEGINS WITH THE NEW BIRTH. When a person is TRULY BORN AGAIN, THEY ARE a new creation possessing the very spirit of Christ who changes their desires, attitudes, and character from the inside out. This new birth then continues its work in the individual, transforming them daily to reflect God's word and produce a life worthy of the gospel. IT IS NOT AN INSTANT PERFECTION OF the flesh. IT IS A CONTINUAL SHAPING OF THE believer as they yield to God's word and spirit. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THAT TOKEN WILL BRING YOUR BODY SUBJECT TO THE WORD. SEE, &gt;&gt; genuine transformation IS THE EVIDENCE OF GENUINE CONVERSION. &gt;&gt; A life being daily aligned with God's nature, will purpose. It produces a willing a willingness from the heart to hear, to recognize, and act upon the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AS I SAID TO YOU EARLIER, DEMONS ARE SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW WHEN TO RETREAT. THEY'RE LIKE A GAMBLER. They wrote a song like that somewhere back in my youth in the 80s about gamblers knowing when it's time to walk away. AND DEMONS ARE SMART. THEY'VE BEEN PRACTICING ON HUMAN BEINGS FOR six millennia, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They're very good at fooling you. &gt;&gt; AND BUT THEY KNOW THAT SOMETIMES THE LORD CAN COME IN AND DRIVE THEM off &gt;&gt; but and they'll BE AND THEY'LL JUST GO BECAUSE THEY KNOW IF THEY HANG AROUND THEY'RE GOING TO SUFFER AN ANNIHILATION. SO THEY'LL QUICKLY RETREAT SO THAT YOU'LL THINK, "OH, I'M I'M GOOD. THIS IS ALL I NEED." AND IT'S NOT ALL YOU NEED. THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR YOU TO CALM DOWN, &gt;&gt; GET A DRINK OF WATER, SIT DOWN, AND THEY'LL COME RIGHT BACK IN. AND THEY DON'T START WITH A PHYSICAL ATTACK LIKE EVE. THEY START WITH A QUESTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BEFORE YOU LONG, BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU'RE A LITTLE WAYS DOWN THE road and they've got you right back where I remember Brother Lonnie used to describe it that Okay. SO, THE DEVIL KNOWS HOW TO JUST, YOU KNOW, cross the moat, pull up the bridge, AND JUST WAIT IN HIS castle &gt;&gt; until you calm down, and then he'll lower the bridge back down and walk back across right into your life. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't be that kind OF A CHRISTIAN, FRIENDS. LET THE WORD CLEANSE YOU. Stay free, STAY CLEANSED, GROW IN GRACE. &gt;&gt; LET THE LET THE WORD DWELL IN YOU RICHLY. &gt;&gt; LET THE MIND WHICH WAS IN CHRIST BE in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; I thought ABOUT THIS AND THE LORD JUST SPOKE IT IN MY HEART. MUTUAL DESIRES with God. I thought, what does that even mean? What does IT MEAN TO HAVE a mutual desire with God? I had so many Bible people I love to have talked about. I I would have loved to have talked about Moses and Abraham and uh and and go up through the prophets. There's so much good preaching in there. I wanted to go in through the New Testament and, you know, talk about St. Paul and the different ones, but I I basically WHITTLELED IT DOWN TO JUST talking about David and the son of David, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Having a mutual desire with God because that was what David was known for. &gt;&gt; He he HAD A HEART LIKE GOD. THE BIBLE SAID, "HE'S A MAN after my own heart." That means that my the the motives and objectives and desires and feelings I have, he's like that. &gt;&gt; He's like me. He's a chip off the old block. He thinks like me, feels like me, reacts like me. He's a man after He's a man like me. He's a man after my own heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, AND SO HAVING MUTUAL desires with God means that your wants, which you have in YOUR HUMAN WILL BECAUSE YOUR FLESH IS NOT CONVERTED. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THE GREATEST BATTLE BEGINS. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE GREATEST battle till you're born again. &gt;&gt; Now you've because THEN YOU ARE A TRIUNE BEING AND ALL ALL THREE OF YOU WERE HEADED IN THE DEVIL'S DIRECTION. BUT GOD COMES IN AND CHANGES ONE OF THOSE REALMS AND NOW YOU'VE GOT A A GREATEST BATTLE EVER FOUGHT. YOU'VE GOT AN INSIDE MAN THAT SAYS, "I WANT GOD." AND YOU'VE GOT A FLESH THAT SAYS, "I LIKE THE WORLD." AND YOU'VE GOT AN INSIDE MAN SAYS, "WE'RE GOING TO CHURCH." AND YOU'VE GOT AN OUTSIDE MAN SAYS, "I'M TOO TIRED TO GO TO CHURCH." BUT GREATER IS HE &gt;&gt; THAT IS IN ME, THANK GOD, THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD. AND SO I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF THAT. I'M A BELIEVER BECAUSE OF THAT. &gt;&gt; I'M DETERMINED TO SERVE GOD. &gt;&gt; DO YOU FAIL? I DO. AND I REPENT, BUT I'M DETERMINED TO SERVE HIM. &gt;&gt; I WILL NEVER SURRENDER. I WILL NEVER QUIT OR GO BACK. &gt;&gt; I would rather die. &gt;&gt; Amen. It means that YOU'RE YOU'RE BEING RESHAPED. YOUR WHOLE WANTS AND DESIRES TO HAVE MUTUAL DESIRES WITH GOD. YOUR YOUR DESIRES ARE BEING RESHAPED UNTIL THEY LINE UP WITH HIS. IT'S NOT, AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT, IT'S NOT JUST OBEYING HIM BECAUSE YOU SHOULD. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, "OH YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO HELL." OF COURSE you don't. But that's not why you obey him. You obey him genuinely because you want what he wants. &gt;&gt; You love what he loves. &gt;&gt; You gladly turn away. You're glad to be given the power to turn away. &gt;&gt; From things that he rejects &gt;&gt; often even before you're even told to. &gt;&gt; Brother B talked about that there in Africa and those native women from the tribal areas. and with almost no clothes on because they're raised as heathens. They don't know. And he said, "Nobody told those women to suddenly cover up." He said, "As soon as the Holy Ghost fell on them, women covered themselves and walked out of the PRESENCE OF MEN." NOBODY EVEN had to instruct them. Sister Jean could give you a testimony from her as a young woman, JUST A YOUNG MOTHER. And when she came, nobody had to tell her to lay down the things of the world and garments that pertain to a man and smoking and cursing and all of THESE THINGS. SHE THEY JUST STOPPED. YEAH. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "I CAN'T I CAN'T RECONCILE THE WOMAN I KNOW NOW WITH THAT KIND OF WOMAN." YOU KNOW WHY? CUZ SHE'S NOT THAT WOMAN ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; SHE'S A BRAND NEW UNIT. SHE'S A NEW CREATION. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT WRONG TO THINK THAT'S NOT THE SAME WOMAN. &gt;&gt; That's exactly why. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; MUTUAL DESIRES IS ALIGNMENT. IT'S DEFINITELY NOT COERCION. It's not God dragging you to his will. your heart is voluntarily lending and and leaning and you're willing to just be leased and bought and used &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; in your daily life. This goes deeper than behavior, friends. I hope you're getting that. &gt;&gt; Please don't limit in your mind that I'm talking about just mere behavior. &gt;&gt; Um this is your motives. This is your affections. this is, you know, they they they've GOT TO YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A POINT WHERE YOUR MOTIVES AND YOUR OBJECTIVES START MATCHING HIS motives &gt;&gt; and OBJECTIVES NO MATTER WHAT IT COST YOU. &gt;&gt; SEE, so the scripture points at at this directly uh there in Jeremiah 31:33 put he's going to put his law in their inward parts. See? So, so that's mutual desire in action. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's mutual desire in real time. See, IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S HIS WILL IS BECOMING YOUR WILL. SO, DAVID, A MAN AFTER GOD'S OWN HEART, DAVID CERTAINLY ISN'T CALLED THIS BECAUSE HE WAS FLAWLESS. CLEARLY, he was not flawless. SEE, BUT BUT BUT BUT WHAT MADE HIM LIKE THIS IS THAT HE DESIRED GOD HIMSELF. NOT JUST GOD'S BLESSINGS. WOW. &gt;&gt; HE WANTED GOD HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; SEE, AND WHEN CORRECTED, HE HUMBLED HIMSELF. Y'all have HEARD THE STORY FROM WAY BACK IN THE DAY WHEN we had our challenge down at the university and and and I and here's this, YOU KNOW, DR. BAKER IS, you know, SO RESISTING I CAN'T EVEN HARDLY GET A WORD OUT. AND HE, YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT, YOU KNOW, PREDESTINATION AND ELECTION OF GOD. IT'S RIGHT IN THE BIBLE. AND HE SAYS, WELL, HE SAYS, UM, AND WE START TALKING ABOUT CAIN AND HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, YOU YOU YOU TALK ABOUT DAVID AND and you talk about Cain and he SINNED AND BECAUSE HE WASN'T ADAM'S SON, LIKE, RIGHT? SO, which so you're SAYING HE'S NOT GOD'S HE'S NOT GOD'S A PRODUCT OF GOD'S LIFE? THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT. Cain was not. Cain was of that evil one. The Bible says I didn't say it. The Bible says it. &gt;&gt; You teach HE WAS FROM THE EVIL ONE? NO, I DON'T. THE BIBLE DOES. I ONLY SAY WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. AND HE SAYS, WELL, HE SAYS, THEN I GUESS DAVID WASN'T OF GOD EITHER BECAUSE he sinned just like Cain. Now, THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD PUSH BACK. AND FOR ABOUT A MILLISECOND, I DIDN'T HAVE AN ANSWER UNTIL A VOICE SPOKE INSIDE MY HEAD AND SAID, "YES." BUT DAVID REPENTED. &gt;&gt; DAVID HUMBLED HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; CAIN WOULD NOT REPENT. CAIN DUG IN AND SAID, "I WILL NOT CHANGE MY WAYS AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE MY WAYS." &gt;&gt; BUT DAVID SAID, "OH, FORGIVE ME. RENEW IN ME. CREATE IN ME A CLEAN HEART and renew a right spirit in me. &gt;&gt; Was there anyone who exemplified a perfect mutual desire with God than Jesus himself such an ultimate example to do the father's will? He said, "I do always those things which please him." &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; He said, "It is written of me in the scrolls. Lo, I have come to do thy will, O Lord." He finally says just before he pays the ultimate sacrifice, not my will, thine be done. &gt;&gt; So mutual desire doesn't mean the lack of struggle. Jesus had such a struggle. The Bible says in that he feared. He was heard in that he feared. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he his sweat became like drops of blood. and he asked if there's a way around it. &gt;&gt; He didn't want to die such a horrible death and nearly be mutilated uh before he was finally killed. &gt;&gt; And he didn't want to leave his brethren. He was young. He had his brethren. He had his ministry. He loved life. He wanted to live. But he knew, you know, as he as he looked at those at those brethren with him, he knew that this could only be temporary if he didn't give his life for them. &gt;&gt; His love for them said, "I'll die for them so that I can have them forever." So that on the other side 26 trillion, what did I say last? Brother Bram said 400 billion trillion billion trillion years downstream. Jesus still wanted to sit by a stream and have fellowship with you and me and his disciples. I just say count me in. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that you'll lack, you know, mutual desire. doesn't mean you'll LACK STRUGGLE, BUT IT DOES MEAN PERFECT SURRENDER. &gt;&gt; Sure does. &gt;&gt; See, it's something that something that and I I search for a word and I'm rarely lost for a word, but I I I feel like I don't have the enough of the right words, but it's something about God's word that is so intrinsic in my heart. It didn't used to be. So, I know something happened. I can remember a time when it wasn't and now it is. And something in there happened. Say, "Take me down to a to a date in a year and give me the time that you looked at your watch." I didn't. I don't know. All I know is I once WAS LOST. NOW I'M FOUND. &gt;&gt; I once know. NOW I DIDN'T SO CARE, BUT NOW I DO. HERE I DIDN'T. NOW I DO. &gt;&gt; And and it's AND IT'S IT'S UH IT'S SO A PART OF ME. IT RESONATES. His word resonates through me. &gt;&gt; Amen. The more I GET OF IT, THE MORE I WANT OF IT. And and and and EVEN IF HE HAS TO CORRECT ME, HOW MANY GET CORRECTED? And and isn't IT TRUE THAT THAT CORRECTION THOUGH IT FEELS PAINFUL, IT FEELS RIGHT &gt;&gt; AND IT DOESN'T FEEL OFFENSIVE. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; COME ON. YOU BORN AGAIN PEOPLE. WHEN GOD HAS TO CORRECT YOU, ISN'T IT TRUE &gt;&gt; THAT IT IT FEELS RIGHT. IT DOESN'T FEEL OFFENSIVE. RIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, &gt;&gt; might be painful, but I need it. &gt;&gt; Your prayers begin to shift from bless me, Lord, to order my steps, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's what Ruth wanted. She didn't want just per handfuls of purpose. She wanted Boaz. &gt;&gt; She knew if she got Boaz, she got the whole field. every person. I'm going to say this and I'm going to call the musicians. Brother Tony, get ready to bring your team. You've been very patient today and I appreciate it. I've managed to stay on t on on track. I've managed to come to the end of this series, but please don't let it be the end of you in life. I want you to go forward and learn from these things and learn how to let the word of God dwell in you richly. Learn how to surrender and humble yourself to every word of God. Learn to let your desires be aligned with his desires &gt;&gt; because every person in the Bible who truly walked with God, they were not just doing his will, but they wanted &gt;&gt; to do his will. Come Anthony, bring your team. Let's you you just stay seated for a moment. I'm going to play an audio clip for you. And I read you the opening text of brother Brandham when he gave an opening text for Is your life worthy of the gospel? My favorite sermon in all, 1200 plus tapes. Has been for many years. And I've they're going to get to a part where he says, "I want to raise my both hands to God." And I even after all these years, even up to this morning, sitting in my office playing it, I can't hold back the tears. And I'm hoping I've cried myself out already so that I can get through this. This is This is not only me wanting from you. This is me for me. this. You're about to hear what I want. &gt;&gt; Amen. G, give me that. &gt;&gt; Just remember, Jesus humbled himself to death for you. &gt;&gt; He was not fussy. When they spit his face, he didn't spit back. When they pulled his beard out, he didn't pull it theirs. When they slapped him on one side of the face, the other, he never slapped him. He prayed for him. Walked on humbly. He was an example of humility. He was full of faith. Why? He knowed his words couldn't fail. He so lived by the word that he became the word. Oh God, let me hold my both hands to God before this audience. Let me live like that. Let this word so become that me and this word's the same thing. Let my words be this word. Let the meditation my heart let him be in my heart on my mind. Tie his commandments upon the post of my intelligence. P upon the post of my heart. LET ME JUST SEE HIM when temptation rises. Let me see Christ. Can I interrupt your program, Brother Tony? Brother Anthony, uh uh Brother Andrew, learning to lean. Let's stand to our feet. And after this, Brother Tony, you can go with what you want. But I just want to sing this. It's what's on my heart. &gt;&gt; How many can say that? I raise my both hands and say, "Lord God, let me live like that. Let let this word and and my life be the same thing. Let me want what he wants. Let me act like he acts. Let me have his kind of a life. There's no way for you to do it apart from his help. Friends, why don't you reach out to him today?
