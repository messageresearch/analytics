[39:32] this request to the whole family here
[39:34] and we're joining with her
[39:36] lord we're joining our faith lord with
[39:39] her faith and brother branham said
[39:41] you'll join your faith to our faith and
[39:43] then push that promise right through
[39:45] to completion
[39:47] so we commit it to you lord may the
[39:48] woman be well i don't remember ever
[39:51] knowing her but lord you know her and
[39:53] i'm praying for your mercy today we're
[39:55] asking for your touch on brother ken
[39:57] lord and that's terrible sinus infection
[40:00] lord that we we we know how that devil
[40:02] works using to get in on that but
[40:05] father we're just condemning it in the
[40:07] name of jesus christ and i ask for
[40:10] you to recover our brother rapidly
[40:12] father that we might lay eyes on him
[40:15] again lord among the saints father
[40:18] we thank you for all of your tremendous
[40:22] blessings that you have poured out upon
[40:24] us
[40:25] and master in this day where we've
[40:27] gathered all together again we're asking
[40:30] for thy great mercy now to overshadow us
[40:33] lord keep us safe this of course will
[40:36] still amid a pandemic and we want to
[40:38] have our trust and faith completely in
[40:41] you
[40:41] we're taking steps that we feel are
[40:43] prudent
[40:44] and that are in compliance with lord of
[40:48] at least the recommendations of science
[40:51] but lord we're looking so so much
[40:53] further than science we're looking to
[40:55] you
[40:56] lord though we're not looking to the
[40:57] tree of knowledge we're looking to that
[40:59] which passeth knowledge lord all the
[41:02] fullness of god that it dwell in you
[41:04] that was paul's great desire
[41:07] that all the fullness of god which
[41:09] passes knowledge might dwell in you
[41:10] grant it to us lord today bless our
[41:13] visitors bless those who are not able to
[41:15] be here who perhaps are still streaming
[41:18] brother jason ministering away in saint
[41:21] augustine this morning may you bless him
[41:23] and the audience there abundantly we
[41:25] commit ourselves into your hands for
[41:27] service in jesus name amen god bless you
[41:30] as you are seated
[41:35] um
[41:36] so i guess i could run from this
[41:38] yeah
[41:40] the powerpoint from this okay awesome
[41:42] so perfect let me
[41:45] green means go
[41:48] okay
[41:54] that's actually not rendering correctly
[41:56] but it's good enough hopefully it won't
[41:57] cut off
[41:59] any of the wording because i ran it
[42:01] right to the borders right to the edges
[42:03] let me see what's gonna happen here
[42:06] uh looks like we're gonna be
[42:08] barely okay okay good deal all right
[42:13] amen
[42:16] the last time when we were
[42:19] bringing this thought to you if i might
[42:21] um
[42:22] just background just for maybe the first
[42:25] five or six minutes or so
[42:28] um we were taking you to paul's teaching
[42:31] there in the 13th chapter
[42:34] of hebrews because remember that he's
[42:36] writing his letter to
[42:39] hebrews these are jews and so
[42:42] and so he's writing to his countrymen
[42:44] and he's you know trying to get them to
[42:47] understand that 1600 years of animal
[42:52] sacrifice had come to an end and that
[42:55] now
[42:56] god while it's true
[42:58] as he told the church in the 17th
[43:00] chapter of acts that there was a time
[43:02] when god winked at their ignorance and
[43:04] allowed that kind of thing but
[43:06] now he required all men to repent and
[43:10] repent means you can't just say i'm
[43:12] sorry repent means to stop
[43:14] turn around and go the other direction
[43:17] so there's no your repentance thank you
[43:19] brother tony your repentance is not at
[43:21] all sincere nor is it effective
[43:25] if you fail to do that many times i
[43:28] remember some years ago brother matt uh
[43:30] brought a thought to us how that very
[43:33] often times people are very sorry for
[43:36] the situation that their sin has got
[43:39] them in they're very sorry for the
[43:42] result that they're in but they're not
[43:45] exactly repentant of the sin itself and
[43:48] so they're just very uh regretful over
[43:51] what it's caused israel did that to god
[43:54] constantly he would bring judgment upon
[43:57] them they would straighten up and then
[44:00] he would you know take the judgment away
[44:02] and they would backslide again and and
[44:05] so we find that this is the way of the
[44:07] unregenerate man you can't listen
[44:09] friends you don't have enough willpower
[44:12] to get yourself to heaven amen
[44:15] you just don't have enough willpower to
[44:17] do that it's going to take you're going
[44:18] to have to surrender to the grace of god
[44:21] and let him change your heart change you
[44:24] from the inside out and so we realized
[44:27] that that you know they were the jews
[44:30] were having such a hard time
[44:33] getting rid of that you you find that um
[44:35] in in galatians where
[44:38] judaizers had come among the galatians
[44:40] who paul had won to the lord and began
[44:43] to get them to you know want to take a a
[44:46] way of legalism and they they somehow
[44:48] they had it this this desire that they
[44:51] wanted the the ceremony of the old
[44:53] testament back they wanted to go back to
[44:55] the law they wanted to have these do's
[44:57] and don'ts and you know paul just popped
[45:00] brilliant just such a brilliant
[45:02] beautiful mind that the apostle paul has
[45:04] paul's apostle paul says he just he
[45:06] takes them back to sarah and hagar
[45:08] and he says so which kind of child do
[45:11] you want you know do you want a child
[45:13] born free or do you want a child born of
[45:15] a promise or do you want a child born in
[45:16] slavery because hagar was a slave
[45:20] and in and in the old testament the
[45:22] condition of the mother passed to the
[45:23] son amen see so if she was a slave he
[45:27] was a slave
[45:28] and so so paul has said
[45:30] why would you why would you refuse the
[45:33] promise which came through sarah which
[45:36] is by grace
[45:37] and you're actually asking to take the
[45:39] route of hagar who was a slave who had a
[45:41] slave
[45:43] you know he he brought him to jerusalem
[45:45] he said he said okay which which
[45:47] jerusalem you want the one we're in now
[45:50] we're slaves to the romans
[45:52] the roman government runs our city you
[45:55] know the roman government gives us our
[45:56] laws is this the jerusalem you want or
[45:59] would you rather have the jerusalem
[46:01] above which is free
[46:03] see and so and and then other examples
[46:06] also that paul used there to make his
[46:09] case and so you know he said you know
[46:11] you've been bewitched to think that you
[46:14] can earn it through works you know it's
[46:16] it's it's you started by grace you're
[46:18] gonna have to finish by grace and grace
[46:21] doesn't ever turn into disgrace we're
[46:22] talking about the real goods where you
[46:24] literally get the life of christ inside
[46:27] you and then it's no longer you that
[46:28] live it's christ living it has nothing
[46:30] to do with your willpower you understand
[46:32] you grit your teeth all day long the
[46:34] devil will finally get you
[46:37] come into a service get under the
[46:39] condemnation or the conviction of the
[46:41] holy spirit make a pledge to god i won't
[46:43] do that again it won't be long
[46:46] you know when you get all revived like
[46:47] that but you lack the new birth
[46:50] you know what happens the devil just the
[46:52] devil's still in there that evil
[46:53] nature's still there yeah see that snake
[46:56] hasn't been gotten rid of yet
[46:58] and all the devil does is just retreat
[47:01] into his castle pulls up the drawbridge
[47:03] and doesn't wait you out
[47:05] and as soon as the revival fires are
[47:07] gone because you're you're you're a camp
[47:09] star
[47:10] remember brother branham preached that
[47:12] in in uh and and the hidden uh uh the
[47:15] interval i think they renamed it to why
[47:17] people are so tossed about
[47:18] but uh
[47:20] and and then you're just a camp star
[47:22] you know you you're in the camp but
[47:24] you're out there living just by the
[47:26] stars and you know at one time you got
[47:28] daylight and then the next time you got
[47:30] nighttime and you might have stars but
[47:31] you might not
[47:32] you can't see your way clear and then
[47:34] some people come in you know they come
[47:36] in to live by the menorah by the seven
[47:38] golden lampstands he said but you know
[47:40] the problem with that you try to stay
[47:42] down into that into that way of the ages
[47:44] and sometimes those candles smoke out
[47:46] they have to be they have to be clean
[47:47] those lamp stands those wicks have to be
[47:49] trimmed but you know what happens if
[47:51] brother branham was trying to say but if
[47:53] you just go one more step
[47:55] into the third realm if you become a
[47:57] third realm dweller
[47:59] then you're in the shekinah you've got a
[48:01] golden pot of manna that never fails if
[48:03] you need healing get take out and start
[48:05] eating out of that pot if you need
[48:07] deliverance just start eating the the
[48:09] aaron's rod blossoms blooms and blossoms
[48:13] in the presence you'll always have the
[48:15] presence of god in your life
[48:17] amen
[48:19] and so paul was saying finally saying to
[48:21] the hebrews here listen
[48:23] if you're going to
[48:24] if you're going to go that way and stay
[48:27] with that ceremony of altars and temple
[48:31] worship and animal sacrifice then i'm
[48:34] here to tell you that in christ we have
[48:37] an altar that you even don't even have a
[48:40] right to eat at
[48:42] amen if you're going to stay back there
[48:44] in the tabernacle you don't even have
[48:46] rights to this altar the only way you
[48:49] have rights to this altar is to come out
[48:51] of that old system the only way you have
[48:54] rights to christ is to be born again of
[48:56] the holy spirit
[48:58] see
[48:59] it's not gonna it's not going to get you
[49:01] to heaven just because you believe that
[49:05] the the bible is true or that the
[49:07] message is true or that jesus was the
[49:09] son of god or that brother branham was a
[49:11] prophet of the age because i got a sad
[49:14] news for you all you've done in doing
[49:16] that is join satan's club he believes
[49:18] all of that amen
[49:20] amen amen he believes it absolutely
[49:22] believes it how would he not be pretty
[49:24] crazy to not
[49:25] because both jesus in his earthly
[49:27] ministry and jesus in his last day
[49:29] messenger the devil took such a beating
[49:31] he'd be crazy not to believe
[49:34] amen
[49:35] so it's it's not just about mentally
[49:37] believing it you've got to become it
[49:40] this word came to become
[49:43] this word arrived on the scene it's
[49:45] christ in you that's the hope of glory
[49:50] so you have no right
[49:52] to eat the world
[49:54] in their
[49:56] in their organized way of christianity
[50:00] they have no right to eat at our table
[50:02] yeah amen
[50:04] and it's that is so
[50:07] established with god
[50:09] that when he
[50:11] comes into the
[50:13] first part of the book of revelation
[50:15] you'll find that he
[50:17] he talks about how that
[50:19] that that they they they have they're
[50:22] dealing with this name of blasphemy and
[50:24] of course it's singular and the name of
[50:26] blasphemy brother branham taught us was
[50:28] that trinity baptism and father son holy
[50:32] ghost trinity teaching but you'll notice
[50:34] that by the time it gets all the way
[50:36] over uh to the 17th chapter now it's not
[50:40] a singular
[50:41] name of blasphemy it's names
[50:44] because why this this this mother
[50:48] of harlots has had children
[50:51] so now it's names of blasphemy and
[50:53] brother branham called it because he
[50:55] looks brother the lord the lord is
[50:57] dealing with him in in his yard i think
[50:59] he's mowing his grass and says
[51:01] you know brother brad i'm talking about
[51:02] the catholic church and the spirit of
[51:04] god says don't call that that
[51:06] and brother brown says what do you mean
[51:08] he says that's not they're not a church
[51:10] they're a lodge
[51:12] amen so he said you don't have a a
[51:15] catholic church you have a catholic
[51:16] lodge you don't have a methodist church
[51:19] you have a methodist lodge you don't
[51:20] have a upc church you have a united
[51:23] pentecostal whatever you would rather
[51:25] have said call it what you want church
[51:26] god church christ doesn't matter it's a
[51:28] lodge
[51:30] and it's part of the harlot daughters
[51:32] because because and the holy spirit
[51:34] directed him to the greek in his
[51:36] diaglott it doesn't say names of
[51:38] blasphemy it says blasphemous names
[51:41] and brother said that's a big difference
[51:42] from names of blasphemy so what started
[51:45] out singularly in the church when it
[51:48] invaded the church as a name of
[51:49] blasphemy by the time you get to the end
[51:52] time it's got 2 000 years and it has
[51:54] accumulated daughters and they're all
[51:57] blasphemous names
[52:00] and they they can they can it doesn't
[52:03] matter that they read from this book or
[52:05] sing our same songs i'm not talking
[52:08] about the people i'm talking about their
[52:09] system people who abide that system have
[52:12] no right to the table where you sit
[52:16] they have no right to the altar they're
[52:19] they and and that you know what that
[52:20] means that means they they can't get
[52:23] born again right amen because they have
[52:26] no right to the altar
[52:27] and that's why it comes all the way at
[52:29] the end in chapter 17 at the end time
[52:32] and the lord by the time we get to now
[52:34] by the time we get to now that god's not
[52:37] dealing in those ages like that anymore
[52:39] he has called the bride come out of her
[52:41] my people
[52:42] arise shine thy light has come and so
[52:46] we've been caught up now to the opening
[52:48] of the book and now we're we're not
[52:50] eating on the body
[52:52] of a man on the words of a man we're
[52:54] eating on the body word of the son of
[52:56] man
[52:58] amen and that's our table that's our
[53:01] altar there's where forgiveness of sins
[53:04] exists
[53:06] scripturally
[53:08] scripturally
[53:09] see so there was a time when he gave
[53:13] that system a space to repent
[53:16] and that time is over
[53:17] amen so he said i'll cast her into a bed
[53:20] of death and her children with her yeah
[53:22] see
[53:23] and so you you you have to that's why
[53:26] today that i take this title no place at
[53:30] the altar and for a subtitle
[53:32] god declaring a difference and calling
[53:35] for separation amen
[53:38] my sermon today might seem hard against
[53:41] against denominations please bear in
[53:43] mind we're not preaching against people
[53:46] we're preaching i'm trying to help those
[53:49] people by identifying that their system
[53:52] is leading them to the mark of the beast
[53:55] if you love them you'll do the same
[53:58] if you've got christian friends who are
[54:00] caught in that system and you claim that
[54:02] they're your friend you claim that you
[54:04] have affection and love for them then
[54:06] you will surely tell them that friend my
[54:10] oh i love you and i want you to know
[54:12] that if you stay in that system you will
[54:15] take the mark of the beast
[54:18] that's right
[54:19] say well i don't i don't i don't want to
[54:22] rock the boat
[54:23] well then they'll die
[54:25] without mercy and it'll be on you
[54:29] see
[54:31] so
[54:32] you're you're you're here
[54:34] you're not your own
[54:35] you're here to be a messenger you're
[54:38] here to be a witness
[54:40] god gave you eternal life so you could
[54:42] tell others about it
[54:44] god's not santa claus
[54:48] you know he didn't just hand out gifts
[54:50] you know some big jolly thing that you
[54:52] know the more he piles on you the more
[54:54] you love him generally the more a kid
[54:56] gets piled on them the more spoiled they
[54:58] get
[55:00] but he's not that kind of father he's a
[55:02] father who loves correctly
[55:05] and so he he has placed us here and
[55:08] given us the gift of eternal life we
[55:09] made the analogy last time and i i
[55:11] thought i i didn't feel i even
[55:13] sufficiently got the burden of my heart
[55:16] off and thought i might touch it again
[55:18] today
[55:19] where we were saying you know i made the
[55:21] reference how that
[55:22] you know there's plenty of churches
[55:25] around
[55:26] just our little seaside city
[55:30] there's plenty that will let you sisters
[55:33] wear short skirts never say anything to
[55:35] you other than they might compliment you
[55:38] they'll let you brothers take social
[55:40] drinks and get mad and cuss and maybe
[55:42] smoke on the side and gamble and do all
[55:44] kinds of things they'll let you men get
[55:46] out here and run around naked also
[55:49] and they'll tell you you're a fine
[55:51] christian and they'll make you feel good
[55:52] and they'll pat you on the back they
[55:53] might even make you put you in the choir
[55:56] amen
[55:59] so
[56:00] why would you come here
[56:02] where all of that stuff is blown up amen
[56:06] the truth so why are you here
[56:08] you there
[56:10] there's way more churches that you could
[56:12] that church could be a much more fun
[56:14] experience for you
[56:17] say well when i get old enough that's
[56:18] exactly what i'm going to do some have
[56:21] some have
[56:22] that doesn't stop the parents or the
[56:24] pastor from praying for them
[56:26] see and believing
[56:27] and
[56:28] and and i'll tell you like brother
[56:30] branham told billy he said you know he
[56:32] said you know you're standing like a
[56:34] cross and he said you've went down this
[56:36] wrong way he said but somewhere down
[56:38] that line god will turn you around
[56:39] because i've already claimed you for
[56:40] this side
[56:41] now the priest say well that's wonderful
[56:43] no there's a caveat the rub is brother
[56:46] branham said but to get back might be a
[56:48] long road hole
[56:51] and you wish you had it never went down
[56:52] that way because daddy and mama and
[56:55] pastor aren't going to let you get off
[56:57] of this one and so you know it's you you
[57:01] you you gotta you gotta understand that
[57:03] that's how god loves but but my point to
[57:06] you friends is listen
[57:08] the point is
[57:09] so if you're going to come here
[57:12] and you're going to subject yourself to
[57:15] gun barrel straight preaching
[57:18] if you're going to come here and say i'm
[57:20] a christian
[57:22] then
[57:23] be one
[57:24] amen if you're gonna say i'm a believer
[57:27] then be one
[57:29] because you're crazy you're crazy to
[57:32] come here and not be amen you're nuts
[57:37] you should go somewhere where you don't
[57:38] get beat up all the time
[57:40] you should go somewhere where they just
[57:42] let you do whatever you want
[57:44] see
[57:45] you're nuts to come here because that's
[57:47] never going to happen as long as this is
[57:49] on the pulpit
[57:51] so if you're going to come here as a
[57:53] believer and you say i say why do you
[57:55] come here you know what you could say to
[57:56] me and i would say the same thing to you
[57:59] i you know if god came down and his
[58:01] voice thundered through this building
[58:03] today how many believe that could happen
[58:07] god spoke right out people thought it
[58:08] sounded like thunder that's the voice of
[58:10] god rolling around
[58:12] and let me tell you something jesus
[58:13] turned to a crowd and he turned to his
[58:15] own when 70 left him because they didn't
[58:17] like getting beat up
[58:19] and he turns to the to the his 12 and

[59:46] hallelujah
[59:48] so so we find
[59:50] that that we we come to this place and
[59:54] and watch let me now let me take some
[59:56] scriptures here i'm going to have to get
[59:58] moving
[1:00:00] oh the lord is dealing with me so early
[1:00:02] this morning and i just
[1:00:04] cannot can i just take my time even if i
[1:00:06] don't finish i won't wear you out we'll
[1:00:07] stop and we'll make a third part if we
[1:00:09] have to make it 30 parts if we have to
[1:00:12] um all right so
[1:00:16] so now we find then that here's a point
[1:00:18] that i want to make before we go to our
[1:00:19] very first scripture make sure it's
[1:00:21] right yep before we go to our very first
[1:00:23] scripture i want you to catch something
[1:00:26] in the bible all right how many like to
[1:00:27] do that
[1:00:29] here it is
[1:00:32] god
[1:00:33] has a different lens that he looks
[1:00:36] through
[1:00:38] you might look through it and you might
[1:00:40] see it as a certain thing
[1:00:43] just be aware that god looks through a
[1:00:46] different lens
[1:00:48] see
[1:00:49] you you can look you know as a human
[1:00:51] being we can look at people and go well
[1:00:54] wow that's a pretty good person
[1:00:56] you know i mean they love the lord they
[1:00:58] go to a church but you have to
[1:01:00] understand that what might look good to
[1:01:03] them it obviously does why they're there
[1:01:04] and it might look fine to you god uses a
[1:01:07] different lens
[1:01:10] see
[1:01:10] and so you're going to have to accept
[1:01:13] his view of things
[1:01:16] and you know something friends humanly
[1:01:18] speaking from a from just a straight up
[1:01:21] human living in a body that's still not
[1:01:24] yet converted that can still get mad
[1:01:26] right right
[1:01:28] amen sure
[1:01:29] that can still get disappointed that can
[1:01:31] still stumble in their faith
[1:01:33] hey we're all in this thing together
[1:01:34] aren't we
[1:01:36] come on all you holy people let's admit
[1:01:38] it
[1:01:38] let's just take ownership of that today
[1:01:40] we're we don't always get it right but i
[1:01:43] know i always want to
[1:01:45] and when i don't i'm always repenting
[1:01:47] see
[1:01:48] say why do you repent because i didn't
[1:01:50] want to do it that way i wanted to do it
[1:01:52] his way
[1:01:54] that that more than any other thing
[1:01:55] shows my heart's been changed
[1:01:57] because you can't want that naturally
[1:01:59] the human the human spirit the human
[1:02:01] mind is enmity against god it could
[1:02:02] never agree with god and never desire
[1:02:04] what god desires it can be afraid of
[1:02:06] hell
[1:02:07] it can be afraid of the tribulation and
[1:02:09] not want to go there and try to serve
[1:02:10] god out of fear
[1:02:13] it can it can serve god out of guilt
[1:02:16] see i know this is wrong i know i know i
[1:02:18] shouldn't do it i know god's against it
[1:02:19] i know i was raised different you know i
[1:02:21] just feel so guilty i'm going to comply
[1:02:23] you know you're wasting your time too
[1:02:26] what you why are you here if that's all
[1:02:28] you're ever going to come to
[1:02:31] let me tell you something friends why do
[1:02:32] we preach why do we have a church why do
[1:02:34] we gather to change us into him
[1:02:39] you can't go to heaven in your condition
[1:02:41] and you can't improve it's only only he
[1:02:44] the only life he can accept is his own
[1:02:48] see and so that's got that has to be
[1:02:50] what is on display in your life so now
[1:02:53] you're ready to look through god's lens
[1:02:56] that's weak wow you ready to look
[1:02:58] through god's lens
[1:03:01] amen
[1:03:02] all right
[1:03:03] second corinthians 6 14-18
[1:03:08] be not
[1:03:09] unequally yoked together with
[1:03:11] unbelievers
[1:03:13] for what fellowship here is a very good
[1:03:16] question this is a question you ready to
[1:03:18] answer it in your heart
[1:03:19] for what fellowship hath righteousness
[1:03:22] with unrighteousness
[1:03:24] now the only answer that you could give
[1:03:26] me that would be a positive answer to
[1:03:29] which i would say amen go for it is if
[1:03:32] you're saying i'm trying to witness and
[1:03:34] win win them
[1:03:36] and if you're doing that well and good
[1:03:38] but that don't take years
[1:03:42] that don't take months a lot of times it
[1:03:45] don't take weeks
[1:03:47] you understand don't let the devil fool
[1:03:49] you into thinking that you know
[1:03:53] it's okay to have this relationship with
[1:03:55] this person and you never tell them the
[1:03:57] truth
[1:03:59] you understand all right watch
[1:04:02] what fellowship hath righteousness with
[1:04:05] unrighteousness
[1:04:06] and what communion hath light with
[1:04:08] darkness is that a valid question isn't
[1:04:10] that logical
[1:04:12] and what concord
[1:04:14] hath hath christ with belial
[1:04:18] belial is something worthless what
[1:04:20] concord would you have with that what
[1:04:21] agreement would you have
[1:04:23] why would you interlace and intermingle
[1:04:26] yourself with something worthless right
[1:04:28] amen
[1:04:30] and what agreement hath the temple of
[1:04:32] god with idols for ye are the temple of
[1:04:36] the living god so if what agreement
[1:04:38] would the temple of the living god have
[1:04:40] with idols amen
[1:04:43] so then what's those things in your life
[1:04:45] that shouldn't be there
[1:04:46] amen
[1:04:48] i might get quiet
[1:04:50] it's all right
[1:04:55] if i can get myself to go in here and
[1:04:57] try
[1:04:58] one more time here we go
[1:05:01] as god hath said
[1:05:03] i will dwell in them
[1:05:06] and walk in them and i will be their god
[1:05:10] and they shall be my people
[1:05:13] wherefore
[1:05:15] come out from among them
[1:05:18] did i say that or did paul say it
[1:05:22] amen
[1:05:23] amen reject me all you want disagree
[1:05:26] with me all you want i didn't say it
[1:05:28] he said it
[1:05:30] right
[1:05:31] i will be and he's he's he's only
[1:05:34] speaking to you the voice of god
[1:05:36] wherefore come out from among them see
[1:05:40] and be is separate paul quoting the
[1:05:43] scriptures
[1:05:44] saith the lord
[1:05:46] and touch not the unclean thing
[1:05:49] and i will receive you
[1:05:52] and will be a father unto you
[1:05:54] and ye shall be my sons and daughters
[1:05:57] saith the lord almighty
[1:06:01] so how many want to be sons and
[1:06:03] daughters of the almighty
[1:06:06] amen
[1:06:09] let's go to peter
[1:06:11] but there were false prophets also among
[1:06:14] the people
[1:06:16] even as there shall be false teachers
[1:06:19] among you
[1:06:21] see
[1:06:22] ah who privately shall bring in
[1:06:26] damnable heresies
[1:06:28] even denying the lord that bought them
[1:06:32] and bring upon themselves bring upon
[1:06:35] themselves swift destruction
[1:06:38] and many shall follow their pernicious
[1:06:41] ways
[1:06:42] by reason of whom the way of truth shall
[1:06:46] be evil spoken of not sad amen
[1:06:52] verse 9 the lord knoweth how to deliver
[1:06:55] the godly out of temptations
[1:06:57] and to reserve the unjust unto the day
[1:07:00] of judgment to be punished
[1:07:02] but chiefly them that walk after the
[1:07:05] flesh and the lust of uncleanness and
[1:07:08] despise government presumptuous are they
[1:07:11] self-willed they are not afraid to speak
[1:07:15] evil of dignities
[1:07:19] but these as natural brute beasts you
[1:07:22] know what made them a brute beast
[1:07:25] say well they just became a horrible
[1:07:27] person
[1:07:29] they didn't become a brute beast
[1:07:32] they were born a brute beast
[1:07:36] that's why god can have mercy on them
[1:07:38] that's why brother branham would say
[1:07:41] god will never condemn a man for being a
[1:07:42] sinner right
[1:07:44] not a beautiful thing
[1:07:45] god will never condemn a man for being a
[1:07:46] sinner because the man was born a sinner
[1:07:50] see god knows that god the bible says
[1:07:52] man was subjected to it the creature was
[1:07:54] subjected to it not willingly
[1:07:56] he is the way we came it's part of god's
[1:07:58] plan of redemption brother branham said
[1:08:00] for that reason god will never condemn a
[1:08:02] man for being a sinner because he was
[1:08:04] born a brood beast
[1:08:06] see by your by the way you were born and
[1:08:08] so the only way to undo that is to get
[1:08:11] the holy ghost and then it's no longer
[1:08:13] you the brute beast living it's christ
[1:08:17] so i'm not i'm not up here today
[1:08:20] you know
[1:08:21] you know just trying to crush everybody
[1:08:24] that doesn't believe the full word of
[1:08:26] god
[1:08:26] that's not even what this sermon is
[1:08:28] about this sermon you know what if i had
[1:08:31] a a church full today
[1:08:33] who were not believers at all and had
[1:08:36] never really heard about the message i
[1:08:37] wouldn't be preaching this sermon to
[1:08:39] them
[1:08:40] no nor would i want you to
[1:08:42] i'd want you to go out and tell them
[1:08:44] about hey i know you think what you got
[1:08:46] is great but let me tell you there's
[1:08:47] something more
[1:08:49] you know give them something to love
[1:08:51] give us show them something i'm
[1:08:53] preaching this sermon to you
[1:08:55] because you're already supposed to be
[1:08:57] believers
[1:08:59] you're already supposed to know that we
[1:09:01] have no fellowship or concord with
[1:09:03] darkness
[1:09:06] and if you want to be pleasing to the
[1:09:07] lord god who bought you
[1:09:10] then give your life to him and get rid
[1:09:13] of idols and get rid of your idols in
[1:09:16] association and in your recreation and
[1:09:18] in your lifestyle and in your habits
[1:09:20] come on amen
[1:09:23] amen amen
[1:09:25] amen see
[1:09:28] say oh you'll never win anybody
[1:09:30] preaching this kind of sermon i wouldn't
[1:09:31] be preaching this kind
[1:09:33] if i was in a crusade somewhere
[1:09:36] see i'd sure not hesitate to tell them
[1:09:39] about a god of i wouldn't hesitate to
[1:09:41] tell them there is a lake of fire
[1:09:44] but i'd also tell them that there's
[1:09:45] jesus who saved them from it if they
[1:09:47] wanted
[1:09:48] but i'd make it clear that they
[1:09:50] understood that jesus is his word
[1:09:54] that a simple belief in a historical
[1:09:56] figure is not going to be sufficient
[1:09:58] alone to give you a new birth
[1:10:01] because you have to come to where he's
[1:10:03] at now this is the same one that died on
[1:10:05] calvary
[1:10:07] only this is more of him amen
[1:10:09] you understand that
[1:10:11] so so you have the one at calvary that's
[1:10:13] that that that occupies
[1:10:16] about
[1:10:18] that occupies about that much in this
[1:10:21] book
[1:10:22] the man at calvary
[1:10:24] there's a lot more than the man at
[1:10:26] calvary
[1:10:27] amen
[1:10:28] so if you really love them you want to
[1:10:30] tell them about everything
[1:10:32] that god has for them
[1:10:34] but these as natural brute beasts made
[1:10:37] to be taken and destroyed speak evil of
[1:10:40] the things that they understand not do
[1:10:42] you know why that sounds so harsh
[1:10:44] because you say
[1:10:46] wow
[1:10:47] wow god is just like really harsh
[1:10:51] he's talking to people who chose this
[1:10:54] yes
[1:10:56] they chose this
[1:10:59] god will never condemn a man for being
[1:11:01] born like this but he said what will
[1:11:03] condemn the man is who condemned himself
[1:11:06] because he remained this
[1:11:09] when he did not have to god coming in
[1:11:13] the likeness of his son paid the price
[1:11:15] for you to be redeemed and it's free
[1:11:20] what would you pay i mean look at what
[1:11:22] they pay these days they they take a man
[1:11:26] because that he can bounce a ball and
[1:11:29] get it to go through a hoop better than
[1:11:30] anybody else and they pay him more money
[1:11:33] one man than probably all the all the
[1:11:37] income of the of the entire globe you
[1:11:39] know or at least america uh 200 years
[1:11:42] ago yeah
[1:11:44] amen
[1:11:45] they pay one man to do that
[1:11:47] what so
[1:11:49] so if if they're willing to pay that
[1:11:51] kind of money to somebody who can put a
[1:11:53] basketball through a hoop what would you
[1:11:55] value eternal life at
[1:11:57] all
[1:11:59] i mean when you can't get that ball
[1:12:01] through the hoop anymore eternal life is
[1:12:03] still going strong
[1:12:05] when you don't spend all that money and
[1:12:06] all your fame and nobody even remembers
[1:12:08] you anymore
[1:12:09] eternal life is still shining
[1:12:11] so what would you pay
[1:12:13] what would you pay if you're if you're
[1:12:14] willing to say yeah i think that athlete
[1:12:16] deserves that 50 million contract well
[1:12:18] then what would you pay the lord jesus
[1:12:20] to give you eternal life well good news
[1:12:23] it won't cost you a dime
[1:12:25] hallelujah it's free
[1:12:26] you can have it all you got to do is
[1:12:28] accept it
[1:12:30] oh my
[1:12:31] gosh
[1:12:33] and shall utterly perish in their own
[1:12:37] i'm going to add this on the authority
[1:12:39] of other verses their own willful
[1:12:40] corruption
[1:12:42] amen
[1:12:43] because god doesn't
[1:12:44] delight in the death of anybody even a
[1:12:46] sinner
[1:12:49] he goes on peter's not done with us
[1:12:52] having eyes full of adultery
[1:12:55] and that cannot cease from sin
[1:12:59] beguiling unstable souls
[1:13:02] a heart
[1:13:03] they have exercised with covetous
[1:13:05] practices cursed children
[1:13:07] which have forsaken the right way
[1:13:10] and are gone astray
[1:13:12] following the way of balaam the son of
[1:13:15] boser who loved the wages
[1:13:19] of unrighteousness
[1:13:23] that is
[1:13:26] for lack of a better term stunning
[1:13:31] you know it's interesting
[1:13:33] that
[1:13:34] and and don't forget that
[1:13:37] my subtitle
[1:13:39] is that
[1:13:40] god is calling for a separation
[1:13:44] see
[1:13:45] god is calling for a separation from
[1:13:47] these things
[1:13:49] and so
[1:13:51] here's here's a clue to something that
[1:13:53] they did they followed the way of balaam
[1:13:56] that peter's saying the people today
[1:13:59] are following in the same way that the
[1:14:01] people followed balaam back there
[1:14:04] in fact as you'll notice that they do
[1:14:06] that again in the pergamon church age
[1:14:08] that they have the they have this whole
[1:14:10] thing of balaam you know and and and
[1:14:12] you'd be amazed at how
[1:14:14] brother branham deals with this a lot in
[1:14:16] the church age book and and the series
[1:14:18] how that balaamism and nicolaitanism
[1:14:22] are so intertwined and i never
[1:14:24] understood quite
[1:14:26] why that was such a connection to
[1:14:28] brother branham until i started doing a
[1:14:29] little bit of research on this on this
[1:14:32] whole thing of balaam or balaam-ism
[1:14:35] and so
[1:14:36] here's some commentary from bible
[1:14:38] knowledge commentary one of my favorites
[1:14:42] and so there whether you're talking
[1:14:44] about
[1:14:46] israel in the wilderness in the book of
[1:14:48] numbers or whether you're talking about
[1:14:49] peter in his day or whether you're
[1:14:50] talking about the pergamy and age down
[1:14:53] through the ages whether you're talking
[1:14:54] about now the principle's always the
[1:14:57] same
[1:14:58] and one of the things that that the
[1:15:00] bible knowledge commentary points out is
[1:15:03] that
[1:15:04] balaamism refers to a sub that people
[1:15:08] were guilty of a severe compromise
[1:15:12] that's what was happening in pergamus
[1:15:14] especially
[1:15:15] that they that they were guilty of
[1:15:17] making a very severe it wasn't a light
[1:15:20] thing it probably started that way but
[1:15:22] they were making a severe
[1:15:25] compromise
[1:15:26] and and and you have to understand what
[1:15:29] was happening in in pergamus at that
[1:15:31] time
[1:15:32] that the church because pergamos means
[1:15:34] married and so now the church is really
[1:15:37] coming into that state of matrimony with
[1:15:40] the false antichrist church it's only
[1:15:43] going to be one just by the next age
[1:15:45] they're going to crown a false prophet
[1:15:46] put a triple crown on his head and
[1:15:48] plunge head long into the dark ages all
[1:15:50] right
[1:15:50] amen so
[1:15:52] we find that that it had gotten to the
[1:15:54] point
[1:15:56] around the christians
[1:15:58] around the real true believers
[1:16:01] that that you know it's it's all about
[1:16:03] balaamism and eating meat sacrificed
[1:16:06] unto idols and committing fornication
[1:16:08] that's what balaamism was they invited
[1:16:10] them in the feast of bel peor to eat
[1:16:12] meat sacrifice to idols and to commit
[1:16:14] fornication
[1:16:15] because the
[1:16:17] the temples in those days in in order
[1:16:20] for you to have a spiritual experience
[1:16:22] supposedly you had to go in and have
[1:16:25] carnal relations with a priestess
[1:16:29] and so they had prostitutes in the
[1:16:32] temple of these heathen churches
[1:16:34] and and then you've got to realize that
[1:16:37] people in mass overwhelming numbers who
[1:16:40] would go to those temples
[1:16:42] then they carry that out in their daily
[1:16:44] life around and they're coming around
[1:16:46] the believers just like they do today
[1:16:49] your children go to school with people
[1:16:51] who who who eat who prostitute the word
[1:16:55] of god
[1:16:57] with the same spirit of adultery
[1:16:59] and your children go to schools and
[1:17:01] public schools i've i was
[1:17:04] from the day i raised my children i
[1:17:06] still stand on it i don't condemn you
[1:17:08] you're welcome to do however you choose
[1:17:10] i stand opposed to public school for
[1:17:13] kids i'm against it was against it back
[1:17:15] then i'm against it to this day thank
[1:17:17] god we've got some charters and private
[1:17:19] schools and christian schools if we
[1:17:21] didn't have those my goodness we'd be
[1:17:23] forced with no other option but to
[1:17:25] homeschool and i'm i'm certainly in in
[1:17:28] in favor of women getting enough
[1:17:31] education so they can homeschool if they
[1:17:33] need whatever arise don't let me get on
[1:17:34] that i'm not here to preach on that
[1:17:36] today i don't even know why i said that
[1:17:37] amen but it's out there anyway
[1:17:40] the public schools are nothing but
[1:17:42] demons and devils
[1:17:44] and it's to the teachers the students
[1:17:46] the faculty the agenda the government
[1:17:48] the policies
[1:17:50] it's all behind it it's that's that's so
[1:17:53] ironclad you
[1:17:54] you'd never survive an argument with me
[1:17:56] on that because i can prove it by by
[1:17:58] statistics and what more that it proves
[1:18:00] what their true agenda has been and it's
[1:18:03] not much better it's worse probably in
[1:18:05] the colleges and that's why that's why
[1:18:07] if somebody's going to go to college i'm
[1:18:08] not opposed to that but get home go to a
[1:18:11] college where you can be home where you
[1:18:13] can still come to church where you can
[1:18:15] still be around your godly family this
[1:18:17] world is nothing but poison
[1:18:20] amen
[1:18:22] it's particularly rough on girls
[1:18:24] i appreciate the sisters that we've had
[1:18:27] who've went to college and held their
[1:18:28] head up high and got their degree and
[1:18:30] came out of college just as much of
[1:18:32] believers they were when they went in
[1:18:35] glory be to god it hasn't happened on
[1:18:37] all of them sadly but i appreciate the
[1:18:39] ones that it has happened on
[1:18:41] and so
[1:18:42] so we find then that
[1:18:44] here was a condition that was happening
[1:18:46] in in pergamus now catch this
[1:18:49] because this is what happened to the
[1:18:51] believers when they went to the feast of
[1:18:52] bel pior this is what was happening in
[1:18:54] the days of the apostles this is what
[1:18:56] was happening in pergamus this is what's
[1:18:58] happening now
[1:19:00] because that the false churches are so
[1:19:04] prevalent in overwhelming numbers
[1:19:06] because the believers are such an a tiny
[1:19:09] fraction
[1:19:11] less than one percent of a population
[1:19:13] generally
[1:19:14] speaking and and
[1:19:16] and the condition began to be from bible
[1:19:19] knowledge commentary to where any social
[1:19:22] contact at all
[1:19:25] with the world
[1:19:26] involved idol worship that's how bad it
[1:19:29] got amen to where the pergamy and
[1:19:32] believers couldn't go to any social
[1:19:33] event without it involving idol worship
[1:19:36] it was literally the public was so
[1:19:38] polluted with it that no matter where
[1:19:40] you went and we have that today
[1:19:42] you can't even go to a mcdonald's or to
[1:19:44] a walmart without seeing half-dressed
[1:19:46] women and and half-dressed men and rock
[1:19:48] and roll music you can't go anywhere
[1:19:50] it's pervasive it's on the streets it's
[1:19:52] in the schools
[1:19:54] you know
[1:19:55] don't you think you think i'm kidding go
[1:19:58] go make a seven-year-old mad who goes to
[1:20:01] a public school you'll get cussed out
[1:20:04] i bet it happened
[1:20:06] words i didn't know a seven-year-old
[1:20:07] could even know
[1:20:10] that's happened more than one time
[1:20:12] that's that's where we are today friends
[1:20:14] make no mistake this world is toxic
[1:20:18] poisonous and if it and it's in total
[1:20:20] darkness and gross darkness upon the
[1:20:22] people do you think that's a prophecy
[1:20:24] for some day coming no that's now
[1:20:27] and your only way to survive it is to
[1:20:30] come up higher come up into the light
[1:20:33] come to the brightness of his rising
[1:20:38] because i will promise you
[1:20:40] that you can't go in public you can't
[1:20:42] socialize without running into idol
[1:20:46] worship amen amen your children can't do
[1:20:49] it
[1:20:52] no way can they do it amen that's why i
[1:20:55] say to parents for goodness sake scrub
[1:20:57] them up every day when they come in yeah
[1:21:00] so a little bit too big for me to throw
[1:21:02] in the bathtub i ain't talking about
[1:21:04] bathroom water i'm talking about this
[1:21:05] one
[1:21:06] take them and wash them
[1:21:08] that's good
[1:21:10] come on parents
[1:21:12] what do you think you think they stand a
[1:21:14] chance especially if they don't if
[1:21:15] they're not born again and you're not
[1:21:17] lit and you're not every single solitary
[1:21:19] day scrubbing them head to toe in this
[1:21:23] and they don't even know that this never
[1:21:25] even gets opened maybe twice a week if
[1:21:27] you're if you're streaming a service or
[1:21:29] bring them to the house of god
[1:21:31] come on friends you understand we're in
[1:21:33] satan's eden
[1:21:35] and you know what you say brother jason
[1:21:36] why are you so hammering on this because
[1:21:38] we're the rapture's close we're almost
[1:21:41] home and not only that i say it could be
[1:21:43] another 20 years fine another 20 years i
[1:21:46] can do it i can do 20 more years as long
[1:21:48] as i know that we got a church where the
[1:21:50] power of god is moving we got a church
[1:21:52] where signs and wonders happen we got a
[1:21:54] church where devils are defeated we got
[1:21:55] a church where people get the holy ghost
[1:21:59] i can do 10 20 or 30 more until the day
[1:22:01] i die but what i will not do and lay
[1:22:04] back and just let our young people blow
[1:22:06] into the world and parents that don't
[1:22:09] care i'm here to tell you something
[1:22:10] friends care have a care i care god
[1:22:13] cares
[1:22:15] amen
[1:22:16] [Music]
[1:22:19] take them to every
[1:22:20] let me get off of that anyway
[1:22:24] i know you love your children i'm so
[1:22:26] thankful for that i'm so thankful
[1:22:29] you know and i i can't
[1:22:31] i
[1:22:32] i'm so thankful for
[1:22:33] the parents in here that love their kids
[1:22:35] i'm so thankful my grandkids are raised
[1:22:37] i'm so thankful i raised my kids in the
[1:22:39] love of god
[1:22:40] i'm i'm on the backside of that i'm
[1:22:43] telling you it was worth it
[1:22:45] it was worth it to have them in church
[1:22:47] every service it was worth it to have
[1:22:49] the bible read in our home it was worth
[1:22:51] it to play tapes when they were growing
[1:22:53] up i see the effects of word raising in
[1:22:56] my grandkids and if the lord tarries and
[1:22:58] they have kids i hope it keeps
[1:23:00] continuing
[1:23:04] but it got that's where it got to that
[1:23:07] any social contact at all
[1:23:09] you could not you couldn't have any
[1:23:11] social contact without some form of
[1:23:13] idolatry
[1:23:15] and usually there was they they go on to
[1:23:17] say in the history and pergamos that
[1:23:20] usually meet in the marketplace had even
[1:23:22] been offered to idols earlier i know
[1:23:25] paul dealt with it i'm not not trying to
[1:23:27] qualify that or disqualified today i'm
[1:23:29] just simply saying that it's siege of
[1:23:32] discrepancy
[1:23:33] and you understand that you
[1:23:36] and your family go out into the world
[1:23:38] and interact and you do you have to you
[1:23:41] know why because we don't build a
[1:23:42] commune we don't live like that
[1:23:45] i haven't went out anywhere and bought
[1:23:46] 100 acres and put put big walls around
[1:23:48] and cloistered us all in we're not
[1:23:50] interested in that we're interested in
[1:23:52] going out into the hedges and the
[1:23:53] highways
[1:23:54] but just understand that that that
[1:23:57] everything that you contact out there is
[1:23:59] something sacrificed to idols and it's
[1:24:02] it's laced with idolatry
[1:24:05] this is serious friends this is serious
[1:24:10] and so it it seems that sin had crowded
[1:24:13] in so tight there in pergamum that
[1:24:15] you know that contact with it became
[1:24:17] more and more impossible
[1:24:19] you know it kept accumulating until
[1:24:21] we've accumulated today
[1:24:23] at unprecedented levels
[1:24:26] you're everywhere you go brothers and
[1:24:28] sisters you brothers
[1:24:30] three quarters of us are self-employed
[1:24:32] business owners every time you go in
[1:24:34] somebody's home
[1:24:35] you know something you make sure that
[1:24:37] your light is brighter than their
[1:24:38] darkness
[1:24:40] you young people you go to school you
[1:24:42] make sure your light is brighter than
[1:24:44] the darkness you're going into mom dad
[1:24:46] when you get them home shine some light
[1:24:48] on them
[1:24:49] hallelujah
[1:24:52] i was looking at a study here recently
[1:24:54] and uh it caught my attention because
[1:24:57] elon musk was involved in it starting a
[1:24:59] year ago and is rather secretive they
[1:25:00] didn't say a whole lot about it it's
[1:25:01] just starting to come out now
[1:25:03] and because he's i have a lot of
[1:25:05] interest in things that he's
[1:25:07] doing and he got involved in a project
[1:25:09] to where
[1:25:10] they were they they've taken laboratory
[1:25:13] mice
[1:25:14] and they've they put electrodes inside
[1:25:16] their brain
[1:25:18] now it's not not you can't totally
[1:25:20] correlate that to a human because a
[1:25:22] human has a much larger far more complex
[1:25:24] brain than a mouse
[1:25:25] but but they're just showing you know
[1:25:27] proof of concept
[1:25:29] that that they
[1:25:30] actually
[1:25:32] uh took the mice
[1:25:34] and put something to scare them like
[1:25:36] some image that they would be afraid of
[1:25:38] a natural predator and the mouse would
[1:25:40] freeze in fear like my like mice do when
[1:25:42] they get afraid they'd freeze
[1:25:44] and then they would take the image away
[1:25:46] and the mouse is going about his
[1:25:47] business and those electrodes
[1:25:51] indicated on their on their devices what
[1:25:54] that fear looked like
[1:25:55] and they recorded it
[1:25:57] and then they waited and a couple days
[1:25:59] later they let the mouse run around in
[1:26:01] his cage he still got those electrical
[1:26:02] wires in his head and they just played
[1:26:04] it back to him
[1:26:06] and without the image at all he froze in
[1:26:08] fear
[1:26:09] and they were literally able to plant a
[1:26:11] thought in his head
[1:26:14] and and they and they've realized now
[1:26:15] that they can they can plant happiness
[1:26:18] they can defeat depression they can
[1:26:19] defeat all these it's just cutting edge
[1:26:21] of science and that was a year ago and
[1:26:23] they hoped within maybe 10 years to get
[1:26:26] to where they could lose the wires they
[1:26:27] didn't need 10 they only needed one yeah
[1:26:31] and you know how they do it now
[1:26:33] late
[1:26:35] they literally shine a light
[1:26:38] in
[1:26:39] intensely
[1:26:40] and and like fiber optic networks that
[1:26:42] travel by light they shone the light on
[1:26:45] the on the head of the mouse with no
[1:26:47] electrodes anywhere
[1:26:49] streaming from him
[1:26:51] he's got receptors still in his brain
[1:26:53] and they just shine the light and
[1:26:54] immediately they can get him to play be
[1:26:56] afraid be happy
[1:26:58] scream they can get him to eat they can
[1:27:01] get him to eat from which bucket they
[1:27:02] want
[1:27:03] all by light
[1:27:05] i sit there thinking brother mark i
[1:27:06] thought let this mind which is in christ
[1:27:08] jesus being you how does it come friends
[1:27:11] from the light of god's word
[1:27:13] oh don't underestimate the light of
[1:27:15] god's word you got a problem in your
[1:27:17] life you need more lights
[1:27:19] you got problems and fears and anxieties
[1:27:21] and weaknesses you're in bondage today
[1:27:24] get under the light
[1:27:26] open your mind and your heart to the
[1:27:28] light of god's word and let god channel
[1:27:31] and fix those things inside you
[1:27:34] amen
[1:27:37] so we find i'm i'm i'm going to have to
[1:27:40] find her i'm not going to finish but
[1:27:41] it's okay
[1:27:45] interestingly
[1:27:47] the bible knowledge commentary goes on
[1:27:49] to say and this is as far as i went with
[1:27:51] it
[1:27:53] it talks about how that the problem in
[1:27:55] pergamus was compromised with worldly
[1:27:58] morality and pagan doctrine said it was
[1:28:00] prevalent in the church especially in
[1:28:02] the third century when christianity
[1:28:05] became popular that always happens
[1:28:08] when you're involved with a christianity
[1:28:10] that's popular
[1:28:12] true christianity
[1:28:14] is never popular
[1:28:16] so if you find yourself in a
[1:28:18] christianity that's palatable and
[1:28:19] popular to your associates you're
[1:28:22] obviously
[1:28:23] projecting the wrong idea about
[1:28:26] christianity
[1:28:27] get mad if you want that's the truth
[1:28:31] and so it says so compromise
[1:28:34] with with pagan here's what happened
[1:28:36] when christianity becomes popular
[1:28:38] compromise with pagan morality and a
[1:28:41] departure from biblical faith soon
[1:28:44] corrupted the church
[1:28:46] and lastly they make this point that i
[1:28:48] thought was astonishing
[1:28:50] and and let me know why brother branham
[1:28:51] connects it so closely to nicolaitanism
[1:28:55] that that the
[1:28:56] that the the nicolaitans this is
[1:28:59] actually dr constable from dr constables
[1:29:01] notes actually
[1:29:02] he says the nicolaitans evidently
[1:29:05] regarded
[1:29:06] these sins as acceptable
[1:29:09] under the pretense
[1:29:12] of christian liberty
[1:29:14] don't they do the same thing today
[1:29:17] oh jesus just loves me it doesn't matter
[1:29:19] how i live
[1:29:20] doesn't matter how i dress doesn't
[1:29:22] matter what i do i love jesus jesus is
[1:29:24] cool
[1:29:27] why'd they kill him
[1:29:30] why do they hate him in the form of his
[1:29:32] word today
[1:29:34] see
[1:29:35] if you've got a jesus that people are in
[1:29:37] love with and they're unconverted you're
[1:29:39] showing them the wrong jesus the only
[1:29:40] way they're going to love the jesus
[1:29:42] is if you're converted and they get
[1:29:44] converted
[1:29:45] and they'll love that jesus and i do
[1:29:47] love that jesus the more you look like
[1:29:50] this the more i love you amen that's
[1:29:53] what makes us love one another that's
[1:29:54] why you ever wonder why the family of
[1:29:56] god
[1:29:57] can actually get conceived you might
[1:29:59] have a blood family that are not born
[1:30:01] again not in the message not in not even
[1:30:03] in christians you ever notice that the
[1:30:04] family of god becomes closer to you than
[1:30:06] your own blood family
[1:30:08] what's up with that how is that even
[1:30:09] possible because it's the love of god
[1:30:11] moving among us
[1:30:13] it's real this isn't this isn't some
[1:30:16] imagination this is real and tangible
[1:30:19] you can actually possess the love of god
[1:30:21] hallelujah
[1:30:23] see
[1:30:25] and and so we find then he says
[1:30:28] he says interestingly
[1:30:30] dr constable says interestingly
[1:30:33] balaam in hebrew
[1:30:35] can mean
[1:30:36] swallow the people
[1:30:40] i've never heard that below it can mean
[1:30:42] swallow
[1:30:43] balaam can mean in the hebrew one of its
[1:30:46] renderings
[1:30:47] swallow
[1:30:48] the people
[1:30:49] so dr constable says so the ideological
[1:30:53] connection between
[1:30:55] balaamism and nicolaitanism which is
[1:30:57] conquer the people
[1:30:59] and and balaam which is swallow the
[1:31:02] people no wonder they're so connected
[1:31:05] no wonder god is saying it in the
[1:31:07] scripture because you know what you know
[1:31:09] what ends up happening friends is that
[1:31:11] you associate with the world and in
[1:31:14] spite of the fact that you try to stay
[1:31:16] free of it you get too close you you rub
[1:31:18] shoulders with it's idolatry you eat off
[1:31:20] of its poisonous toxic tables you have
[1:31:23] it in your homes and your car in your
[1:31:25] associates and your recreation and your
[1:31:26] activities you get a little bit of
[1:31:28] washing once or twice a week if you come
[1:31:30] to the house of god and and then you
[1:31:32] know what ends up happening balaamism
[1:31:34] swallows you
[1:31:36] amen and the next thing you know it's
[1:31:38] nicolaitanism because it conquers you
[1:31:42] and here you come to church week in and
[1:31:44] week out sometimes year in and year out
[1:31:46] and bound with the same thing the same
[1:31:48] thing and you never get free i'm here to
[1:31:51] tell you something friends there's a
[1:31:52] remedy for you today but it's going to
[1:31:54] take your willingness to surrender and
[1:31:57] let god live inside you
[1:32:00] you can't do it on your own and if and
[1:32:02] if you don't do this you're going to end
[1:32:05] up like that
[1:32:07] it's inescapable
[1:32:10] amen
[1:32:15] i'm going to stop with this with this
[1:32:17] statement i'm just going to it's going
[1:32:18] to stop
[1:32:20] anthony bring your team and come back
[1:32:27] constable concludes with this i want you
[1:32:28] to listen to this
[1:32:30] lest
[1:32:31] you think in your mind
[1:32:34] william branham was just an old fogey
[1:32:38] you know that's a
[1:32:39] 50-plus year old message and we're we're
[1:32:41] living in a modern day
[1:32:43] well let's go outside the ranks
[1:32:46] let's here here's one of the most
[1:32:47] respected scholars uh from dallas
[1:32:49] theological seminary all right
[1:32:52] listen to what dr constable says
[1:32:54] the main facet of the doctrine of balaam
[1:32:58] which is being promulgated in the
[1:33:00] churches today
[1:33:02] amen
[1:33:04] is the teaching
[1:33:06] that equal future blessings and rewards
[1:33:09] have been set aside for every christian
[1:33:12] solely on the basis of christ's finished
[1:33:15] work on calvary
[1:33:16] and the christians position positional
[1:33:19] standing in christ
[1:33:20] thus all christians here's the thinking
[1:33:24] all christians regardless of their
[1:33:27] conduct during the present time will
[1:33:30] receive crowns and positions of power
[1:33:34] and authority with christ in the
[1:33:36] millennial kingdom
[1:33:38] that's what dr constable says that's
[1:33:41] what's wrong he said this is what's
[1:33:42] broken in the world
[1:33:44] he said that everybody's got this idea
[1:33:47] every christian solely on the basis of
[1:33:50] christ's finished work what he did
[1:33:52] and and what his what he did gives me my
[1:33:55] position in christ and because i say he
[1:33:56] was the son of god took away the sins of
[1:33:58] the world and i go to a church then i'm
[1:34:00] going to get equal
[1:34:02] authority and blessing and power in the
[1:34:04] millennial world listen to what he goes
[1:34:05] on to say
[1:34:08] however
[1:34:09] the teaching throughout the word of god
[1:34:12] is to the contrary
[1:34:14] the israelites did not sin with immunity
[1:34:17] and neither can christians
[1:34:19] sin in the camp of israel re resulted in
[1:34:23] the israelites being overthrown in the
[1:34:25] wilderness short of the goal of their
[1:34:27] calling and it will be
[1:34:29] no different
[1:34:30] for christians
[1:34:36] no different amen
[1:34:40] perhaps you know you've seen
[1:34:43] maps sometimes where you they're old
[1:34:45] ancient
[1:34:46] maps where they didn't have the whole
[1:34:47] world mapped and
[1:34:50] you'll see a ship going across the ocean
[1:34:52] and they'll have you know water waves
[1:34:54] and here's a land mass and over here is
[1:34:56] like uh they're not sure what it is but
[1:34:58] they've gotta they'll they'll they'll
[1:35:00] they'll you'll see like a sea monster
[1:35:02] coming up
[1:35:03] because it it's it's indication
[1:35:06] that
[1:35:07] they don't know what's there and it's
[1:35:09] pretty spooky
[1:35:10] it's probably bad
[1:35:12] and and they'll they'll have the term
[1:35:15] here be dragons you ever seen that on an
[1:35:17] old map you'll have a ship going across
[1:35:18] and way over here in uncharted waters
[1:35:20] it'll say here be dragons
[1:35:23] they they even they they have that's in
[1:35:25] in in latin and hebrew that i can't dare
[1:35:28] pronounce but
[1:35:29] and then and then the romans
[1:35:31] the romans and medieval
[1:35:33] uh
[1:35:34] cartographers you know they they would
[1:35:36] use a different version of of literally
[1:35:40] uncharted lands they would say here be
[1:35:42] lions they'd show a commander here's
[1:35:44] your map here's what you're doing here's
[1:35:45] where we are here but over here here be
[1:35:47] lions

[1:36:12] and it's in every it's in the social
[1:36:14] fabric it's embedded in society
[1:36:18] and there's no way for you to even live
[1:36:20] anymore outside of it unless you went
