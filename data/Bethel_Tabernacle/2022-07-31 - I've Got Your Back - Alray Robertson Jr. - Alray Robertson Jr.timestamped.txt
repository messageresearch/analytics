[46:23] place we follow attributes amen of the
[46:26] lord jesus so he just thanked the lord
[46:28] joshua one
[46:30] and we're going to start from verse 1.
[46:33] now after the death of moses the servant
[46:35] of the lord it came to pass that the
[46:37] lord spake unto joshua the son of nun
[46:39] moses ministers saying
[46:41] moses my servant is dead now therefore
[46:43] arise go over this jordan thou and all
[46:46] this people unto the land which i do
[46:48] give to them even to the children of
[46:50] israel every place that the soul of your
[46:52] foot shall tread upon
[46:54] that have i given unto you as i said
[46:56] unto moses from the wilderness and this
[46:59] lebanon even unto the great river the
[47:01] river euphrates um all the land of the
[47:03] hittites and unto the great sea toward
[47:05] the going down of the sun shall be your
[47:07] coast there shall not any man be able to
[47:10] stand before thee all the days of thy
[47:12] life
[47:14] as i was with moses so i will be with
[47:16] thee
[47:17] i will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[47:20] be strong and have a good courage for
[47:23] unto this people shall thou divide for
[47:24] an inheritance the land which i swear
[47:26] unto their fathers to give them
[47:30] only be they are strong and very
[47:31] courageous that they must observe to do
[47:33] according to all the law which moses my
[47:35] servant commanded thee turn out from me
[47:38] to the right hand or to the left that
[47:41] thou mayest prosper with us whoever thou
[47:43] goest
[47:44] this book of the lord shall not depart
[47:46] out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate
[47:48] thee in day and night that thou mayest
[47:50] observe to do according to all that is
[47:52] written therein for then thou shalt make
[47:55] thy way prosperous and then they shall
[47:57] have good success
[47:59] have not i commanded thee be strong and
[48:01] have a good courage be not afraid
[48:03] neither be thou this mage for the lord
[48:05] thy god is with thee wither so ever
[48:07] there goes but i love i just love that
[48:09] first portions of joshua regard says to
[48:12] joshua over and over and over and over
[48:14] be strong
[48:15] be courageous i am with you be strong
[48:18] hallelujah
[48:19] one more scripture just uh two verses
[48:22] from isaiah 54.
[48:25] isaiah
[48:27] chapter 54. i trust that my accent is
[48:29] not too strange to you
[48:32] praise the lord
[48:34] [Laughter]
[48:36] you see i'm sitting kind of between
[48:37] between two opinions i i have a mix of
[48:40] south african and kiwi uh new zealand
[48:43] accent and and and when i walk around
[48:45] the new zealanders they easily say
[48:47] you're a south african and when i go to
[48:49] south africa they they hear the kiwi
[48:51] tinge in the in the language so it's
[48:53] kind of somewhere in no man's land but
[48:55] it's all good
[48:57] so isaiah 54 verse 4
[49:00] again god says fear not
[49:03] for thou shalt not be ashamed neither be
[49:05] they are confounded for they shall not
[49:07] be put to shame for thou shalt forget
[49:09] the shame of thy youth and shall not
[49:12] remember the reproach of thy widowhood
[49:15] more
[49:16] for thy maker is thine husband the lord
[49:19] of hosts is his name
[49:21] and the redeemer the holy one of israel
[49:23] the god of the whole earth shall he be
[49:25] called
[49:26] amen we'll just read that fa you may
[49:28] take your seeds
[49:34] do we have that power point on the
[49:37] here we go
[49:41] so now this morning i would like to to
[49:43] minister and i'll call my title um
[49:47] god's got your back or i've got your
[49:49] back
[49:52] so this morning i would like to just
[49:54] start off with a bit of teaching and
[49:56] just give you a little bit of background
[49:58] and and and i will just you know i'll
[49:59] just say i know how it is when you you
[50:02] have a minister that you don't know you
[50:04] kind of sometimes sit back a little bit
[50:06] and and check you know is this guy going
[50:09] to
[50:10] you know bring anything strange or
[50:11] whatever and like i said i want you to
[50:14] relax
[50:15] um and and i'll also say up front if
[50:17] there's anything that confuses you that
[50:19] that you know that that you don't agree
[50:21] with you absolutely welcome to to chat
[50:24] to me afterwards but most importantly
[50:27] go to your pastor i mean
[50:29] brother bannon made it very clear that
[50:31] that that that pastor is there to to
[50:33] shepherd you through
[50:35] i mean so so i don't the last thing on
[50:37] my heart is to come and cause confusion
[50:39] or anything i just want to be a blessing
[50:41] but what i would like to do is i would
[50:43] like to look at the parallels between
[50:45] the time of moses and joshua and our day
[50:48] and just look at how absolutely
[50:49] beautiful those things just just pan out
[50:51] so i'll just give you know go through a
[50:54] little bit of background and
[50:56] and just to link it up you know we are
[50:59] in the message
[51:00] and
[51:01] and you know we go to church i
[51:03] personally grew up in the message mom
[51:05] and dad got married after both of them
[51:07] had accepted the message already so i'm
[51:10] i guess you can say a second generation
[51:12] message believer
[51:14] um
[51:15] but
[51:17] the the challenge is that for me myself
[51:20] i walked in the message for 38 years
[51:23] before i met the lord jesus
[51:26] at the age of 38 2012
[51:29] so now you can all do the calculations
[51:33] spear the trouble i'm 48.
[51:36] but at the age of 38 i eventually met
[51:40] god personally
[51:42] and and
[51:44] my experience was i lived years
[51:47] under do's and don'ts and doctrine but i
[51:50] never met jesus christ until the point
[51:53] where i actually where i believe god
[51:55] opened to me probably the most important
[51:57] thing for me personally
[51:59] is that i was totally lost
[52:02] i was a deacon in church
[52:05] and to my shame i had been ministering
[52:08] in church
[52:10] and totally lost
[52:13] and god had to bring me to the reality
[52:15] of a new birth
[52:17] and touch my life
[52:19] and
[52:20] and that's the challenge you know many
[52:21] times we can we can treat the message
[52:24] just as another church
[52:26] just as you know more theology or more
[52:29] advanced theology or a group of nice
[52:31] people or what you know whatever i need
[52:33] ah is it okay if i take my jacket off my
[52:35] brother
[52:37] okay thank you very much
[52:40] thank you this is much hotter than at
[52:42] home it's winter time at home at the
[52:43] moment
[52:44] so
[52:45] praise the lord
[52:47] um but but the reality is each of us
[52:49] need to come to that point where we have
[52:51] an individual relationship with the lord
[52:53] you know i believe i believe under the
[52:55] under this voice part of the rapture
[52:57] that we are now in under this in this
[53:00] part we where god is revealing himself
[53:02] and getting preeminence in the bride
[53:04] this is not a theological exercise it's
[53:06] not an intellectual exercise it's not
[53:09] just getting to know more doctrine
[53:11] it's not just to know more than the
[53:13] pentecostal church down the street it is
[53:15] about the individual walk
[53:18] and god makes up a bride and the bride
[53:20] as a whole is a combination of a whole
[53:22] lot of individuals in which god gets
[53:25] preeminence
[53:26] and god doesn't get preeminence when you
[53:28] just know more
[53:30] god wants preeminence in our life so we
[53:32] want real we want reality
[53:36] it's so easy to you know know the cod
[53:39] know the teachings
[53:41] but we need to meet god in that personal
[53:43] relationship
[53:45] so now that's just kind of just to set
[53:46] the trend and for you to to get to know
[53:48] a little bit about me
[53:50] but
[53:52] i want to now take this parallel like i
[53:54] said and in this in this parallel and i
[53:56] know you know many times we look at
[53:58] types and shadows and you can apply it
[53:59] in very different ways and and you know
[54:01] just just go with me this there's a way
[54:03] that i want to look at it now but what i
[54:06] want to look at is moses the prophet of
[54:08] the hour god using him god giving him
[54:11] three pools and we'll look at those
[54:13] things and then that prophet of the hour
[54:16] goes off the scene
[54:17] and then you have the joshua ministry
[54:19] america right and brother randa preaches
[54:22] adoption and you know ephesians
[54:24] parallels joshua and so forth this
[54:26] mature church now comes up under the
[54:28] joshua ministry under moses
[54:30] goes off the scene and so forth
[54:33] so mercy moses had a difficult life
[54:37] moses had to give up his human ideas his
[54:40] human desires
[54:41] moses had to give up a life that he
[54:44] could have lived
[54:46] and submit himself to the will of god
[54:49] you know moses could have been the ruler
[54:51] of egypt
[54:52] he could have been the pharaoh
[54:54] humanistically we might think you know
[54:56] wouldn't if would it have been so much
[54:58] easier if moses became the pharaoh and
[55:00] he just told the children of israel go
[55:02] and so forth but the problem is they
[55:05] would never have gone through those
[55:06] experiences that god needed to give them
[55:09] to actually be loosened from egypt and
[55:11] for egypt to come out of them
[55:14] but moses gave all of that up to be to
[55:18] be with god's people and to be a servant
[55:20] a minister of god's people
[55:23] and even when he got married to zipporah
[55:25] you know he was there looking after the
[55:27] sheep in the backside of the desert and
[55:30] probably after years you know he settled
[55:32] down and he forgot all about israel and
[55:35] probably the last thing on his mind was
[55:37] that he was the deliverer
[55:39] and and if you ask moses
[55:42] you know brother moses are you happy
[55:44] with looking after the sheep in the
[55:45] backside of the desert he would have
[55:46] said amen brother
[55:49] do you want to go back to egypt
[55:51] absolutely not you know he was just
[55:53] happy with the same old same old every
[55:56] day yeah
[55:57] it's the same we could say the same for
[55:59] brother branham you know if he had a
[56:02] choice
[56:03] he would have happily lived with sister
[56:06] hope
[56:08] not go through all the trauma that he
[56:09] had to
[56:10] he he if if he had a choice he would not
[56:13] have picked to become a worldwide
[56:14] evangelist and take all the pressures
[56:16] and and the stresses and the you know
[56:18] all the things that he had to go through
[56:20] he would have preferred to just keep on
[56:22] living a simple christian life
[56:25] but god had chosen a servant to lead his
[56:28] people out in exodus
[56:31] and it's the same for every son and
[56:33] daughter of god brother branham says he
[56:34] says but if we find a great lesson in
[56:37] here that men who follow the spirit is
[56:39] foolish to the world because they have
[56:41] another kingdom led in another way led
[56:44] by the spirit god let that be me and all
[56:47] of you that we will follow the leading
[56:49] of the spirit regardless watching god's
[56:52] promise waiting for it to be fulfilled
[56:56] now you know we we're a different people
[57:00] we're not like the world out there
[57:03] but god is not saying to us you know
[57:05] make yourself strange you know try hard
[57:08] to be different than everyone else try
[57:10] to stand he's not saying that he's just
[57:12] saying live a simple christian life
[57:15] be loving express my word live the life
[57:18] let the light shine off of you
[57:20] right
[57:21] but because the life of god is so
[57:23] different to the life that's in this
[57:25] evil age
[57:26] amen we will stand out we will be
[57:29] strange we will be different but not by
[57:31] our own making you know we can so easily
[57:33] make ourselves strange and different and
[57:35] weird but that's not what he said
[57:37] what we want is reality
[57:40] what we're after is get a reality
[57:42] relationship with god
[57:44] amen so now go i i'm still on this type
[57:47] now so so god spoke lip to ear with
[57:49] moses
[57:50] and moses laid down the law moses laid
[57:54] down god's requirements the pillar of
[57:56] fire was visibly seen on him and of
[57:58] course remember now this is a parallel
[58:00] to our day now and god let moses see
[58:03] into heaven
[58:05] god let moses bring to the children of
[58:07] israel a testimony of the things that he
[58:10] saw and god let moses set up the church
[58:12] according to how he saw it on the other
[58:14] side right
[58:16] and then
[58:18] god took moses off the scene
[58:22] and
[58:23] god took him off the scene before they
[58:24] could enter the promised land
[58:28] and
[58:29] and and so forth and and i maybe i'll
[58:31] say this
[58:33] god used moses
[58:34] to write the cod books for his day all
[58:37] right
[58:38] okay you're worth me now
[58:40] god speaks through the prophet and he
[58:41] shows him all the do's and don'ts in the
[58:43] church order and the feasts and the you
[58:45] know all those things
[58:47] but he'd never lived to see the time of
[58:50] the fulfillment of that full placing
[58:52] himself
[58:54] and then the anointing that had been on
[58:56] moses went over onto joshua
[58:59] just like he did today
[59:02] so so let me let me just put it in other
[59:04] terms now and in terms that we we're all
[59:07] familiar with so when the vessel of the
[59:10] shout goes off the scene
[59:12] the holy spirit now starts working
[59:14] directly with the bride
[59:18] and as the bride and the groom becomes
[59:20] one in this era of the voice
[59:22] i mean
[59:24] that that bridegroom starts getting the
[59:26] preeminence in this bride now
[59:29] and and i will say again you remember
[59:30] brother brahm says joshua means
[59:32] jehovah's savior and it's a type of the
[59:34] holy spirit today the holy spirit in the
[59:36] church
[59:37] that's why the shout was expressed
[59:40] through the prophet but the voice is
[59:42] expressed in many members represented by
[59:44] joshua now and and and what is happening
[59:47] is this is the last
[59:49] last day book of acts being written
[59:52] remember brother branham shows us you
[59:53] know it wasn't the acts of the of the
[59:55] apostles it was the acts of the holy
[59:56] ghost in the apostles and today it is
[59:59] again the acts of the holy ghost in this
[1:00:01] last day bright
[1:00:03] and when that anointing that was on the
[1:00:05] prophet moved over and started
[1:00:06] expressing himself through the bride
[1:00:08] form now it fulfills that prophecy that
[1:00:11] said i'll ride this trail once more
[1:00:14] we're not looking for a return ministry
[1:00:15] of the prophet
[1:00:18] we are looking for a return ministry of
[1:00:19] the of the son of man and that is
[1:00:21] happening right so that's what we're
[1:00:24] looking at but what we're looking at is
[1:00:26] is a life of living reality in god's
[1:00:29] presence a life where this bride is
[1:00:32] becoming one i mean spiritual union is
[1:00:34] not just a doctrine
[1:00:36] spiritual union must be a reality life
[1:00:39] spiritual union must be a relationship
[1:00:41] where this bride becomes fully submitted
[1:00:44] to a heavenly head
[1:00:46] and that is what the spiritual union
[1:00:47] that's what the seventh seal that's what
[1:00:49] the threefold purpose that's what the
[1:00:50] rapturing rapturing process is all about
[1:00:53] i mean is that union in which he gets
[1:00:56] full control
[1:00:58] i just love how all these things come
[1:01:00] together probably one of my favorite
[1:01:01] quotes from the church age book is where
[1:01:03] brother ram says
[1:01:05] authority without character is satanic
[1:01:09] but authority with character is fit to
[1:01:11] rule and that's what god's doing under
[1:01:13] this voice process before he can put his
[1:01:15] his bride on the throne with him before
[1:01:17] she can really become the queen of
[1:01:19] heaven she needs to get that character
[1:01:21] and that's character is being built
[1:01:23] under this voice part of the rapture
[1:01:24] that's what god is doing and part of the
[1:01:26] character is full submission to him
[1:01:29] where he has full preeminence
[1:01:31] where she can come to that place like it
[1:01:33] says and pick up your opinion and write
[1:01:35] she will know what he wants done with
[1:01:36] his word she will have his potentials
[1:01:39] hallelujah but she will know what he
[1:01:41] wants done with his word she will have
[1:01:42] thus saith the lord or she will keep
[1:01:44] still
[1:01:45] right we want to sometimes get excited
[1:01:48] about we will have all the power and
[1:01:49] authority and so forth but before we can
[1:01:51] be trusted with that we need to be fully
[1:01:54] submitted
[1:01:55] so that you only speak when he speaks so
[1:01:57] she only acts when he acts so that he
[1:01:59] can have that living reality in our life
[1:02:02] hallelujah
[1:02:08] brother rams is here
[1:02:10] is this joshua
[1:02:12] no this commission was tremendous did
[1:02:14] you notice the
[1:02:15] or when joshua started to cross georgian
[1:02:17] jordan how joshua remember this
[1:02:19] commission let not this book of the law
[1:02:22] my word depart out of your mouth now
[1:02:24] remember now
[1:02:26] god is saying to me and you now under
[1:02:28] this joshua ministry let not the message
[1:02:31] that you've heard
[1:02:33] pass from you
[1:02:35] let not this book of the lord let not
[1:02:36] this message my word depart out of your
[1:02:38] mouth in other words joshua i don't care
[1:02:41] what the tribe says i don't uh what
[1:02:43] other clergy says stay with this word
[1:02:48] we've received the shout out
[1:02:50] we don't go preach another word
[1:02:52] we want to stay with the word
[1:02:55] what god said in his word and and i want
[1:02:57] to include with that what god said
[1:02:59] through his prophet you know i'm just
[1:03:00] going to pause here for a moment
[1:03:02] what what what is just more and more
[1:03:04] striking to me when i read the messages
[1:03:07] i i it's the same spirit that was on on
[1:03:09] the bible
[1:03:11] it's the same the the way in which god
[1:03:13] spoke through this prophet and the types
[1:03:15] and the shadows and the things it just
[1:03:16] absolutely so exactly the same spirit
[1:03:18] you just pick up the same spirit as in
[1:03:20] the word right
[1:03:22] and and for me you know
[1:03:24] i've heard people have this whole
[1:03:25] argument well i i esteem the bible
[1:03:27] higher than the message or the message
[1:03:29] higher than the bible
[1:03:32] yeah what's the point what's the point
[1:03:34] of that this is the word and we've
[1:03:36] received the word in spoken word form in
[1:03:38] our day hallelujah it's one unit
[1:03:42] but he didn't stop with the prophet that
[1:03:44] same word is now in us
[1:03:46] i mean no the voice of many waters is
[1:03:48] now going forth and brother ramsay is
[1:03:50] the voice of the ministers and i believe
[1:03:52] the voice of many waters is not limited
[1:03:54] to the ministry only it's it's in every
[1:03:56] part of the bride because that elijah
[1:03:58] anointing i mean that joshua that god
[1:04:00] riding this trail once more is now in
[1:04:02] the bride right and god is expressing in
[1:04:04] reality form through the bride i mean
[1:04:06] hallelujah and i believe each one of us
[1:04:08] are standing in exactly the same place
[1:04:11] each one of us is standing in the same
[1:04:13] place as isaiah did
[1:04:15] as mike as as maika did and all those
[1:04:18] prophets we because we are under the
[1:04:20] same anointing
[1:04:21] if we can get out of the way
[1:04:24] let our own humanistic staff and our own
[1:04:26] thinking just get out of the way and god
[1:04:27] can use us
[1:04:29] hallelujah joshua i don't care what the
[1:04:31] tribe says what other clergy say stay
[1:04:33] with this word for then thou shalt make
[1:04:35] thy ways prosperous no matter how many
[1:04:37] big things they do how many little
[1:04:39] things they do how many organizations
[1:04:41] they made stay with this word joshua oh
[1:04:44] my stay with the word this word this
[1:04:47] word shall not depart from your mouth
[1:04:51] if the word says do a certain thing do
[1:04:54] it
[1:04:55] well that's hard brother bran
[1:04:58] no that's pretty easy to understand
[1:05:00] right
[1:05:01] if the word says do a certain thing do
[1:05:03] it i don't care what the organization
[1:05:05] says do it in here that's the joshua
[1:05:07] that god's waiting for turn not one inch
[1:05:10] one iota stay right with the word this
[1:05:13] book of the law
[1:05:14] i want to say this message remember this
[1:05:16] is today now
[1:05:18] this message shall not depart out of thy
[1:05:20] mouth thy mouth what you're saying just
[1:05:23] don't read it and walk away
[1:05:25] say speak it and live it
[1:05:29] right
[1:05:30] and then it becomes a living word then
[1:05:32] it becomes a manifestation of the word
[1:05:34] when we live it hallelujah speak it live
[1:05:37] it teach it but they shall meditate in
[1:05:39] day and night that they almost observed
[1:05:41] to do according to all that is written
[1:05:43] therein see what a joshua of this day is
[1:05:46] going to be hallelujah
[1:05:49] what a living testimony of the word i
[1:05:52] mean a living expression of the word and
[1:05:55] not only this word of course this word
[1:05:58] but the word we heard in this day we're
[1:06:00] living testimonies of that word
[1:06:02] and and and for us to be living
[1:06:04] testimonies it's not done here
[1:06:07] it is the same life expressing itself
[1:06:09] automatically through our lives
[1:06:11] hallelujah
[1:06:14] see what a joshua of the church
[1:06:16] spiritual is going to be it's the same
[1:06:18] kind of a joshua they had in church
[1:06:20] natural church spiritual has got to be
[1:06:22] the same thing he'll meditate there in
[1:06:24] day and night to make the way prosperous
[1:06:27] hallelujah
[1:06:29] like i said the acts of the holy spirit
[1:06:31] in us now
[1:06:33] hallelujah
[1:06:34] you know it was even i loved how even
[1:06:37] when they crossed the jordan river how
[1:06:38] that ark was put up front
[1:06:41] and and and i want to say the ark wasn't
[1:06:44] put up front to to go through the river
[1:06:46] because they thought that golden box had
[1:06:48] the strength to stop the river
[1:06:49] wow
[1:06:50] right come on they didn't look for some
[1:06:53] you know some token or some some
[1:06:55] something like that they put the word
[1:06:58] first they expressed the thought that
[1:07:01] they put the word first
[1:07:03] under the joshua commission above
[1:07:05] everything
[1:07:08] i'll just go back to something that i
[1:07:09] dropped in earlier moses stored up food
[1:07:12] and of course i'm speaking in today's
[1:07:14] terms right moses stored up food in the
[1:07:17] most technologically advanced way he
[1:07:19] could do whether that was papyrus or or
[1:07:22] animal hides or whatever it was but he
[1:07:24] stored up food
[1:07:26] for the joshua people
[1:07:28] hallelujah to be able to take and eat
[1:07:31] and live and teach
[1:07:33] moses lay down the law
[1:07:35] he brought israel the the truth of
[1:07:37] temple worship
[1:07:39] he pinned down god's thoughts about how
[1:07:41] they should live
[1:07:43] and how they should dress and how they
[1:07:45] should act in church order and so forth
[1:07:47] he brought them the conduct order and
[1:07:50] doctrine
[1:07:52] and many things that god revealed to
[1:07:54] them under that moses ministry was
[1:07:56] mind-blowing to the people
[1:07:58] because it was so different to
[1:08:00] everything they had experienced
[1:08:02] they'd never heard anything about that
[1:08:05] before amen but i want you to know just
[1:08:07] now where moses gave the law joshua
[1:08:10] instruction
[1:08:12] joshua's instruction from god was you
[1:08:15] keep it
[1:08:16] you follow it you honor it
[1:08:19] god did not give joshua a new word
[1:08:22] god didn't give joshua a different word
[1:08:26] god's instruction was and is today to
[1:08:28] this joshua i mean under this joshua
[1:08:31] anointing
[1:08:32] keep the word follow the word do not go
[1:08:35] after a different word and so forth
[1:08:37] follow the word that god has given you
[1:08:39] amen
[1:08:40] i just want to quickly i refer to that
[1:08:42] just quickly clarify that three pulls
[1:08:44] under moses ministry
[1:08:46] moses received two signs
[1:08:49] in fact when the angel came to brother
[1:08:50] branham he said as moses received two
[1:08:53] signs you will receive two signs direct
[1:08:55] parallel so moses had a first bull with
[1:08:58] the rod
[1:08:59] moses had a second bull with his hand
[1:09:02] right and then the third ball was when
[1:09:04] he led them out of israel with them
[1:09:06] out of egypt with a mighty hand and he
[1:09:09] brought him out of israel
[1:09:11] to the mountain hallelujah and received
[1:09:14] the word from god and then led them
[1:09:16] towards the promised land
[1:09:20] and the thing i want you to notice is
[1:09:22] we don't read ever in the bible again
[1:09:25] that after they left egypt that the
[1:09:26] first and second pool was ever repeated
[1:09:30] because there was no sign to repeat it
[1:09:32] and it's not necessary to attract the
[1:09:34] people in the middle they were already
[1:09:35] on the journey
[1:09:37] the rainbow trout had come out
[1:09:40] there was still a bunch of crabs and and
[1:09:42] and tadpoles and turtles with them right
[1:09:45] but the rainbow trout were on their way
[1:09:48] hallelujah
[1:09:49] the signs had already vindicated the
[1:09:52] ministry
[1:09:54] but under the third pool the food was
[1:09:56] stored up the word was laid down the
[1:09:59] word was recorded and although that but
[1:10:01] i want to say this although the emphasis
[1:10:03] was no longer on the signs
[1:10:06] god was still a supernatural god
[1:10:08] god didn't suddenly lose his power after
[1:10:11] you know all those things that happened
[1:10:12] in egypt
[1:10:13] god was still with them yes they still
[1:10:16] had water from the rock they still had
[1:10:18] you know the manna falling every day
[1:10:21] a daily i want to say a daily injection
[1:10:24] of god's spiritual feeding
[1:10:26] amen god still did wonderful things when
[1:10:28] joshua lead led israel into egypt you
[1:10:31] know we we read how the the walls of
[1:10:33] jericho falls and god was still with him
[1:10:35] god supernaturally used this bunch of
[1:10:37] nobodies i mean to conquer those mighty
[1:10:40] cities
[1:10:42] but there was no it wasn't a sign
[1:10:45] anymore we didn't need the first and
[1:10:47] second bull sign anymore after that
[1:10:50] but god still showed i'm present i am
[1:10:53] with you i am your head i love you i
[1:10:56] care for you i give you the victories
[1:10:57] and so forth
[1:11:00] of course i don't need to say it but
[1:11:01] that's exactly where we are today
[1:11:04] but the emphasis has moved away from the
[1:11:07] first and second pull
[1:11:09] the emphasis is moved to faith in the
[1:11:12] word
[1:11:13] to take the word i mean
[1:11:16] hallelujah i just i just so love these
[1:11:18] things i just trust that you can stay
[1:11:19] with me now so so so joshua he met the
[1:11:22] captain of the host and the captain of
[1:11:24] the host gave his gave him instructions
[1:11:27] and that captain of the host is giving
[1:11:28] us instructions now
[1:11:30] leading us day by day by day to what
[1:11:33] victories in our own promised land
[1:11:35] amen victories to take on the ais to
[1:11:38] take on the jerichos to take on the
[1:11:40] world cities and so forth the captain of
[1:11:42] the host is with us
[1:11:44] and the captain of the host as he said
[1:11:46] to joshua i'll be with you this step by
[1:11:49] step by step by step every every step
[1:11:51] your feet will take that i give to you
[1:11:53] that that that captain of the host is
[1:11:55] saying that to this bride today
[1:11:57] every step you take i will be with you
[1:12:01] i'm running ahead of myself i'm aware of
[1:12:03] that so now that was that was the
[1:12:05] background but i want to emphasize one
[1:12:07] more thing moses was a man of many
[1:12:09] mistakes
[1:12:11] amen and i hope you're not offended if i
[1:12:13] say that but brother branham was a man
[1:12:14] of mistakes
[1:12:16] right
[1:12:18] but the wonderful thing is god told
[1:12:20] joshua i will be with you
[1:12:23] like i was with moses
[1:12:26] now look at what brother braham says
[1:12:27] here he says but we find here that god
[1:12:29] in spite of all the failure that moses
[1:12:32] had done he still had his hand on him
[1:12:34] and he called him to go do his service
[1:12:37] calling him to his commission
[1:12:39] and what a consolation that must have
[1:12:42] been to joshua when he heard god say as
[1:12:44] i was with moses so will i be with you i
[1:12:47] want you to notice what brother madam is
[1:12:49] saying keep the context now
[1:12:51] brother branham is saying moses was a
[1:12:53] man full of failures
[1:12:56] but even though he was full of failures
[1:12:58] god was with him and when god said to
[1:13:00] joshua as i was with moses joshua could
[1:13:02] get confidence of the fact that although
[1:13:04] i am full of failures although i mess up
[1:13:06] so often although i make so many
[1:13:08] mistakes god was with moses irrespective
[1:13:11] of his mistakes god will be with me
[1:13:13] irrespective of my mistakes hallelujah
[1:13:17] brother adam says again he says although
[1:13:19] i'm trying
[1:13:20] if i'm trying and i fail god won't leave
[1:13:24] me
[1:13:26] he says i don't have much confidence in
[1:13:28] anyone that's too afraid to do anything
[1:13:29] i'd rather be found a failure than too
[1:13:31] lazy to try
[1:13:34] this one time it was said that the
[1:13:35] ballad and ballad flower company hired a
[1:13:37] man and he was going to sign his name
[1:13:39] and the man had no eraser on the end of
[1:13:41] his pencil mr ballard said to him said
[1:13:44] why haven't you got an eraser he said i
[1:13:45] don't make mistakes
[1:13:47] he said then i can't use you
[1:13:50] how many times do we find ourselves too
[1:13:52] afraid to move forward in the spirit but
[1:13:54] god what if this what if i'm not strong
[1:13:56] enough what if i fail what if i make a
[1:13:58] mess what if i say the wrong thing
[1:14:00] hallelujah
[1:14:01] come on let's be soldiers yeah yeah this
[1:14:04] is because if you make a mistake
[1:14:07] it says
[1:14:08] it says if you don't make mistakes sorry
[1:14:11] you won't do
[1:14:12] nothing right goodness you know that's
[1:14:16] one way to stay really safe
[1:14:18] is just to never do anything
[1:14:21] i mean i mean you're not going to mess
[1:14:23] up but then you're not going to have
[1:14:24] victories
[1:14:26] he says god don't hold you responsible
[1:14:28] for your mistakes
[1:14:32] hang on
[1:14:36] that kind of quote absolutely
[1:14:39] ripped the feet from under me growing up
[1:14:42] in the message with all the do's and
[1:14:43] don'ts with all the legalistic ideas and
[1:14:46] attitudes
[1:14:48] god don't hold you responsible for your
[1:14:50] mistakes i thought this is what it was
[1:14:52] all about
[1:14:54] i mean we all have to i've heard people
[1:14:56] present the message what do you believe
[1:14:57] well we our sisters have long hair
[1:15:00] that's not the message
[1:15:02] wow that's not the message
[1:15:05] hallelujah
[1:15:06] and first john it says this is the
[1:15:08] message that we have heard from the
[1:15:10] beginning that god is light
[1:15:12] amen
[1:15:13] in another place this is the message
[1:15:15] love one another as god has loved you so
[1:15:18] far
[1:15:19] the message is the gospel
[1:15:21] it's so easy to get to the place where
[1:15:23] we all have long hair long dresses and
[1:15:25] long faces
[1:15:28] right
[1:15:29] where we can
[1:15:30] hallelujah the message is not a list of
[1:15:33] do's and don'ts
[1:15:35] are we doing away with the do's and
[1:15:36] don'ts now of course not i mean we're
[1:15:39] not doing away with it i mean we have
[1:15:41] the instruction keep the word keep the
[1:15:43] word keep the word
[1:15:45] but god is at the same time saying i'm
[1:15:47] not holding you responsible for your
[1:15:49] mistakes
[1:15:50] because i know i mean paul wrote god you
[1:15:52] know that i am but flesh by that i am by
[1:15:54] dust
[1:15:56] god knows that he made us he designed us
[1:15:59] he holds you responsible for your
[1:16:01] willful son
[1:16:03] he that sins willfully after he has
[1:16:04] received the knowledge of the truth
[1:16:08] he says but a man that's going to do
[1:16:10] something is going to blunder
[1:16:14] oh brother i'd rather not quote that
[1:16:15] quote
[1:16:16] come on this is not reverse psychology
[1:16:19] this is the prophet this is the word of
[1:16:20] god
[1:16:21] a man that's going to do something is
[1:16:23] going to blunder so you mean the
[1:16:25] minister that preaches he's sometimes
[1:16:26] going to make a mess yes
[1:16:29] the mom and dad
[1:16:32] the mum and dad that raises the kids is
[1:16:34] sometimes going to make mistakes yes
[1:16:37] right
[1:16:38] in every way we sometimes going to
[1:16:40] blunder he's going to fall he's going to
[1:16:43] make mistakes but if he's really
[1:16:45] divinely called and god in his heart
[1:16:47] he'll rise again
[1:16:50] amen hallelujah
[1:16:52] this is not taking away your faith that
[1:16:54] should give you faith
[1:16:55] because if you can be honest enough with
[1:16:57] yourself we make mistakes paul wrote i
[1:17:00] have to die daily brother and says he's
[1:17:02] repent daily which means he made daily
[1:17:04] mistakes
[1:17:06] hallelujah but he rose again because he
[1:17:08] was an elected son
[1:17:10] he said he used to be coming to the
[1:17:12] church here years ago and they they may
[1:17:14] be this morning a little man and his
[1:17:15] wife they used to sing a song that
[1:17:17] thrilled me goes something like this
[1:17:19] forgive me lord and try me one more time
[1:17:21] i'll be yours you'll be mine if i fall
[1:17:24] if i fail let me rise and try again
[1:17:26] forgive me lord and try me one more time
[1:17:29] he says i like that for any good
[1:17:31] soldier's app to get wounded or hurt but
[1:17:34] if he's still a soldier and got a
[1:17:35] purpose and something to fight for he'll
[1:17:37] rise and try again any good soldier of
[1:17:40] the cross will do the same thing
[1:17:43] and i just want to make this real this
[1:17:44] morning let's go back to the time when
[1:17:46] they fought with swords and things right
[1:17:49] he says every soldier is sometimes going
[1:17:51] to be wounded
[1:17:52] but you're not the first time you get a
[1:17:54] cut on your arm or something give up and
[1:17:55] say i'm not going to fight anymore and
[1:17:57] walk off the battlefield you get a spear
[1:17:59] in the back of your you know in your
[1:18:00] back
[1:18:03] the more you get wounded the more you
[1:18:05] will get serious about the fight
[1:18:07] and get up again and try again because
[1:18:09] you know this is serious
[1:18:11] hallelujah
[1:18:13] so one now i want you to see the context
[1:18:15] now i'm going to speak about moses again
[1:18:17] when did god call him
[1:18:20] well i'll ask you this first when when
[1:18:22] did god predestinate him before the
[1:18:24] foundation of the earth
[1:18:26] and god predestinated him to be the
[1:18:28] deliverer of his people before the
[1:18:30] foundation of the earth i believe god
[1:18:32] saw that in his attribute
[1:18:34] right
[1:18:36] but from moses humanistic perspective
[1:18:38] when did god call him
[1:18:41] after he messed up everything
[1:18:47] sitting in the backside of the desert
[1:18:49] failing his commission seemingly
[1:18:52] failing it humanistically absolutely
[1:18:55] failing his commission
[1:18:56] when he had lost all hope of being the
[1:18:58] deliverer to lead god's people out
[1:19:02] but look at this i hope you don't mind
[1:19:04] me quoting the quotes perfect
[1:19:06] brother graham says in his failure we
[1:19:08] find out that he fled from the face of
[1:19:10] pharaoh into the wilderness but one day
[1:19:12] god heard the cry of his people god
[1:19:14] remembered that he had a covenant with
[1:19:16] those people now i want you to notice
[1:19:18] now remember now moses the failure
[1:19:22] right humanistically now
[1:19:26] not only that but he also remembered he
[1:19:28] had a servant who he has called and had
[1:19:31] chosen and he had a covenant with that
[1:19:34] servant i love that
[1:19:37] after all his mistakes
[1:19:40] go down and say oh no you failed i'm
[1:19:42] going to tear up this covenant sorry
[1:19:45] god had called him before the foundation
[1:19:46] of the earth to be the deliverer
[1:19:49] and he sat there with all his mistakes
[1:19:50] and failures and all of that
[1:19:52] and he was still god's covenant person
[1:19:55] that god was going to use to lead israel
[1:19:57] out in that first first day exodus
[1:20:00] hallelujah i want to say the vessel had
[1:20:02] lost all hope
[1:20:04] but god had no change of mind hallelujah
[1:20:08] the vessel felt it was too late the
[1:20:10] vessel felt god could never use me again
[1:20:13] hallelujah
[1:20:14] and then after all of that joshua took
[1:20:17] over and joshua could take courage
[1:20:20] god used that vessel that that seemingly
[1:20:23] been such a failure and god did
[1:20:25] wonderful things through him
[1:20:28] hallelujah that's why i love that our
[1:20:30] prophet was open about his mistakes
[1:20:33] he never tried to hid you know all those
[1:20:35] things that he did he never tried to hit
[1:20:37] the fact that he deliberately wanted to
[1:20:39] pull the wool over his wife's eyes and
[1:20:41] you know lie to her and and get you know
[1:20:43] go live off in the wilderness or or the
[1:20:45] you know the time he lied to the lawyers
[1:20:47] and and different things he never tried
[1:20:49] to hear those things he was just open
[1:20:51] with his mistakes so that you and i can
[1:20:53] get courage as i walked with moses i'll
[1:20:55] walk with you
[1:20:57] as i walked with william branham i will
[1:20:59] walk with you hallelujah
[1:21:04] i want to come to this is the the main
[1:21:06] thought now that i where i got the title
[1:21:09] from
[1:21:11] sorry let me just quickly finish that
[1:21:12] i'm sorry and god will never change his
[1:21:15] his covenant or change his desires or
[1:21:17] change anything god will always keep his
[1:21:19] promise although moses had failed him
[1:21:21] and had done that which was wrong yet
[1:21:24] god kept his covenant when god calls a
[1:21:27] man to do something he must do it just
[1:21:30] got to do it and it's got nothing to do
[1:21:33] with how messed up your life becomes
[1:21:35] hallelujah now listen to this he says
[1:21:37] now remember now he's referring to this
[1:21:40] instruction to joshua now this book of
[1:21:42] the lord shall not depart out of thy
[1:21:44] mouth so he had god's word as i was with
[1:21:48] moses move right on out and as i was
[1:21:50] with moses so will i be with you then he
[1:21:53] says i will not fail you
[1:21:57] little bride under joshua ministry i
[1:21:59] will not fail you
[1:22:01] as i was with moses i will be with you i
[1:22:03] hope you can read your own name in this
[1:22:06] you know and it must be more than
[1:22:08] god will be with brother jason and god
[1:22:10] will be with brother jason and god will
[1:22:12] be with brother matt and god will be
[1:22:13] with come on it's not just the ministry
[1:22:16] god will be with you with every last
[1:22:19] member of this bride as i was with moses
[1:22:22] now as the ministry moved over to the
[1:22:24] joshua ministry where the son of man is
[1:22:27] riding this trail once more
[1:22:29] i will be with you i will not fail you
[1:22:32] look at this
[1:22:33] you may fail me
[1:22:35] but i won't fail you
[1:22:38] i put my hand up very quickly i failed
[1:22:40] god so many times
[1:22:42] but he's never failed me
[1:22:45] hallelujah he says listen to this now
[1:22:47] listen to this attitude this is what i
[1:22:49] want to speak on this morning but if you
[1:22:51] fail me my grace is sufficient i'll bear
[1:22:54] you right back up just keep moving on
[1:22:58] god is not saying if
[1:23:00] hallelujah
[1:23:01] if you fail me i'll write you off if you
[1:23:03] fail me i'll you know put you out of the
[1:23:05] church if you fail me i'll i'll stop
[1:23:08] giving you my blessings god is not
[1:23:09] saying any of that he's saying if you
[1:23:11] fail me i will bear you right back
[1:23:14] amen just keep moving forward just keep
[1:23:17] on preaching the battle just keep on
[1:23:19] moving to that promised land just keep
[1:23:21] on moving and taking your ground
[1:23:23] hallelujah inheriting your promise
[1:23:28] as long as you stay with my word i'll
[1:23:30] take care of you
[1:23:33] it's not saying as long as you are
[1:23:34] perfect as long as you don't make
[1:23:36] mistakes as long as you keep every
[1:23:38] little letter of the word
[1:23:40] as long as your heart stays with me
[1:23:42] as long as your desire is for me
[1:23:45] hallelujah as long as that inside of the
[1:23:48] inside is still calling
[1:23:50] i'll be with you i will not fail you
[1:23:54] that's where i got the title from this
[1:23:55] morning
[1:23:57] god has your back
[1:23:58] god has your back
[1:24:00] even when you feel totally messed up
[1:24:03] god is your back when you feel you've
[1:24:05] fallen away from grace
[1:24:07] god has your back
[1:24:09] hallelujah we've made many mistakes over
[1:24:12] the years
[1:24:13] on an age level
[1:24:15] and so forth
[1:24:16] i want you to notice this now
[1:24:20] brother rahm says and how it must have
[1:24:22] felt when joshua standing there that
[1:24:24] morning talking to god he said i'll not
[1:24:26] fear fail thee and as i was with moses
[1:24:29] so will i be with you no man shall stand
[1:24:31] before you all the days of your life i
[1:24:33] will destroy and divide i'll make the
[1:24:36] way clear only be strong and courageous
[1:24:39] how did joshua feel
[1:24:42] now remember joshua's ministry was was
[1:24:44] you know you could say the capstone
[1:24:46] ministry it was a type of this time when
[1:24:48] the capstone would come down crying
[1:24:50] grace grace
[1:24:52] there'd been a change in ministry
[1:24:54] there'd been a change of administration
[1:24:57] and i'm going to say this and i trust
[1:24:58] this he's okay brother jason but
[1:25:01] it took us years to catch the change of
[1:25:03] administration
[1:25:05] it took us years to catch how it went
[1:25:07] from shout to voice
[1:25:09] it took us years to see how it went from
[1:25:11] from from man age to to eagle age how it
[1:25:14] went from church ages to bright age but
[1:25:16] it's even harder for us to see that with
[1:25:18] the trains of administration they also
[1:25:20] came a changing application
[1:25:23] a change in attitude
[1:25:25] a change in where god wants us to catch
[1:25:28] the spirit of the word and not just the
[1:25:30] letter
[1:25:31] moses was there to lay down the law to
[1:25:34] to capture those things to give us the
[1:25:35] cod books and so forth but god wants to
[1:25:38] know when he applies it i mean god
[1:25:41] applies it through that capstone that's
[1:25:43] come down grace grace i'll be with you
[1:25:45] i've got your back we together in this
[1:25:48] hallelujah god is not saying
[1:25:51] i've given you my law now let's see if
[1:25:53] you can perform it and the first time
[1:25:54] you mess up i'll crack the whip and i'll
[1:25:56] whip you and i'll chase you out and i'll
[1:25:58] do this or the other god does not do
[1:26:00] that but yet as message believers many
[1:26:03] of us did that and i'm guilty
[1:26:06] judgmental legalistic hard line
[1:26:09] outspokens cut people off sever their
[1:26:13] character
[1:26:14] we've done that well maybe you're not
[1:26:16] guilty i did
[1:26:18] so much of that
[1:26:21] you see god does not get married to a
[1:26:23] bride because of a law
[1:26:27] god gets married to a bride because of
[1:26:28] love
[1:26:31] god wants us to come into that spirit of
[1:26:33] the composer
[1:26:34] hallelujah amen
[1:26:36] god wants us to catch the spirit behind
[1:26:39] the word
[1:26:40] the spirit behind what brother brahm
[1:26:43] spoke to us or what the holy ghost spoke
[1:26:45] through brother branham
[1:26:47] god wants us to see what he wants done
[1:26:49] with his word
[1:26:51] you see it's easy to apply a law it's
[1:26:54] easy to apply a letter black and white
[1:26:56] is much much easier to work with
[1:26:59] you know i said i said to
[1:27:01] to the church back home you know even in
[1:27:03] church order it's so easy to get in a
[1:27:05] point where we just want to apply it
[1:27:06] black and white
[1:27:09] but there's you know these practical
[1:27:11] things that sometimes we need to seek
[1:27:12] the lord
[1:27:14] but that's too much work
[1:27:15] it's easier to apply the black and white
[1:27:18] but we want to find god's mind for a
[1:27:21] circumstance
[1:27:24] we can so easily miss that god used his
[1:27:26] prophet to express his mind to us
[1:27:30] we've got the same scenario
[1:27:33] brother branham pointed that out with
[1:27:35] moses and joshua god expressed his mind
[1:27:38] moses laid down the law stored up the
[1:27:40] mind of god after after god spoke to him
[1:27:43] lip to ear but when he came to
[1:27:45] application under the joshua ministry in
[1:27:47] the era of grace that's where god said
[1:27:49] i've got your back amen
[1:27:52] you see what i want you to notice is and
[1:27:55] now
[1:27:56] you know don't get me wrong i'm not
[1:27:57] saying one thing is more important than
[1:27:58] the other but but i'm just pointing out
[1:28:01] that in that portion that we read in our
[1:28:02] opening scripture god says to to joshua
[1:28:05] one time keep the word make sure that
[1:28:07] you honor it that you follow it but god
[1:28:09] says to him over and over and over don't
[1:28:12] worry
[1:28:13] don't stress
[1:28:14] i've got your back i am with you
[1:28:16] wheresoever you go
[1:28:18] god says it over and over and over and
[1:28:19] over and over amen be strong be
[1:28:22] courageous i'm with you god is saying to
[1:28:24] this bride be strong be courageous i'm
[1:28:26] with you i've got your back
[1:28:30] i've given you my word and because
[1:28:31] you're elected i know my word is
[1:28:33] important to you and i stand by my word
[1:28:35] and i want you to live my word but i
[1:28:37] know you're gonna fail me i've got your
[1:28:39] back
[1:28:41] i mean that should be such an
[1:28:42] encouragement
[1:28:44] we don't serve god out of fear
[1:28:47] a woman never gets married to a husband
[1:28:49] while she shouldn't get married to her
[1:28:50] husband out of fear
[1:28:52] right we get married to god we get we
[1:28:54] come into the spiritual union because of
[1:28:56] love
[1:28:58] and we become love slaves and love
[1:29:00] slaves become love slaves out of choice
[1:29:03] because of a love amen
[1:29:06] hallelujah
[1:29:08] the problem is many times we have a lack
[1:29:11] of intimate relationship with the
[1:29:13] capstone
[1:29:15] that's when we start pointing fingers at
[1:29:17] others and get critical and judgmental
[1:29:19] and so on
[1:29:22] let's look at a few things we did out of
[1:29:24] fear i hope this is okay
[1:29:26] you can correct this anytime perfectly
[1:29:28] in my experience
[1:29:30] we were so afraid to make grace a
[1:29:32] disgrace
[1:29:33] that many of us ended up in legalism
[1:29:37] we were so afraid of dominating females
[1:29:40] that many in the message became male
[1:29:42] chauvinists
[1:29:46] we were so afraid of jezebelism
[1:29:49] that many message churches became the
[1:29:51] nicolaitanism
[1:29:54] dominating subverting god's people
[1:29:57] bullying god's people
[1:29:59] hurting god's people
[1:30:01] we took hard lines because we became
[1:30:03] critical we acted like pharisees in the
[1:30:05] bible wow
[1:30:07] we started looking for places where we
[1:30:09] could catch out one another to feel
[1:30:11] better about where we were
[1:30:15] we made some of our own rules and i'm
[1:30:17] kind of scared to say examples because
[1:30:20] you know maybe we don't agree on some of
[1:30:21] these things so i'll leave the examples
[1:30:22] out right
[1:30:27] but in many ways we lost sight of and
[1:30:29] interpreted misinterpreted the heart of
[1:30:32] god
[1:30:34] on a church level
[1:30:36] we've got attitudes against other
[1:30:38] churches
[1:30:41] sometimes we compete with other churches
[1:30:43] or other ministries
[1:30:45] we've spoken badly about other
[1:30:47] ministries and other churches and other
[1:30:49] opinions
[1:30:51] we tried so hard to understand
[1:30:53] everything that we forgot the teacher
[1:30:55] himself
[1:30:58] we beat others and sometimes ourselves
[1:31:01] up for mistakes
[1:31:04] but more often we judge others
[1:31:07] through a different lens that we judge
[1:31:09] ourselves
[1:31:11] you know when we do something we we look
[1:31:13] for an excuse but when someone else does
[1:31:15] it they're just bad
[1:31:17] right i mean even even in psychology
[1:31:19] they they refer to this as the
[1:31:20] fundamental attribution error
[1:31:23] you look for an excuse for yourself
[1:31:26] you know let's let's just give an
[1:31:27] example brother so-and-so is late at
[1:31:29] church
[1:31:30] because he's just bad
[1:31:32] you know he's just a slacker he's just
[1:31:34] you know whatever terms you use in in in
[1:31:37] in america
[1:31:38] but when you come late for church well
[1:31:40] it looks like that he hit home for some
[1:31:42] praise god but when you come late for
[1:31:44] church you know it was things went wrong
[1:31:47] at home the traffic was bad and we look
[1:31:49] for all the excuses for ourselves but
[1:31:51] when it comes to the next person we just
[1:31:53] want to cut them off it's just like
[1:31:56] peter take that sword out right
[1:31:59] praise god
[1:32:01] but you know even though we've done all
[1:32:02] those things god still has her back
[1:32:05] amen
[1:32:06] hallelujah he had our back all along
[1:32:10] and even when we find ourselves in the
[1:32:12] backside of the desert spiritually
[1:32:14] speaking far away from the commission
[1:32:15] that god has for us god never forgets
[1:32:18] his promise we stole his elect god never
[1:32:21] forgets his covenant to us and his
[1:32:23] election stands hallelujah and god said
[1:32:25] i know the thoughts i have towards you
[1:32:28] hallelujah amen and god is going to
[1:32:31] bring us he said i will bring you to
[1:32:32] your expected end and god is
[1:32:34] individually saying i will bring you to
[1:32:37] your expected end even though you may
[1:32:39] lose hope
[1:32:40] even though you may feel you failed me
[1:32:42] hallelujah i've got your back
[1:32:46] you know we're so afraid to be seen as
[1:32:48] weak or seen as wrong or seen as
[1:32:50] unspiritual or seen as missing the mark
[1:32:53] right that many times we end up living
[1:32:55] lives of hypocrisy and preteens
[1:32:58] and we can't be real
[1:33:01] no and i believe i i know the heart of
[1:33:03] your pastor has made this a safe church
[1:33:05] where people can come and say pastor i'm
[1:33:07] battling or pray for me
[1:33:09] you know and and that is so important
[1:33:12] because otherwise we all sit at home
[1:33:14] struggling with exactly the same thing
[1:33:17] but would you afraid to say i'm battling
[1:33:20] because we have such pressure to look
[1:33:22] good and such pressure to you know
[1:33:23] everything must look so perfect
[1:33:26] for me personally and i hope this is
[1:33:27] okay but there's no value in a church
[1:33:30] that looks perfect and every heart is
[1:33:32] broken wow
[1:33:34] no value at all
[1:33:36] absolutely not
[1:33:37] it's so easy to have everyone dress
[1:33:40] right act right come into church you can
[1:33:42] hear a pin drop because the prophet said
[1:33:44] we need to hear a pin drop
[1:33:46] right
[1:33:48] it's so easy to follow the letter and
[1:33:50] have no relationship
[1:33:52] amen but if we can become free and say
[1:33:55] god has my back and i can be real
[1:33:59] and brother i'm struggling with lust
[1:34:01] brother i'm struggling with
[1:34:02] you know with with money i am struggling
[1:34:04] with whatever it is
[1:34:06] amen who cares accept that we pray for
[1:34:09] you we support you we love you we
[1:34:11] encourage you because the same god that
[1:34:13] changed me is the same god that's going
[1:34:15] to change you
[1:34:17] and god is not expecting you to change
[1:34:19] you god will change you you just need to
[1:34:21] come with a sincere heart and say god i
[1:34:23] believe this god i want this god my
[1:34:26] desire is this and the reason that
[1:34:28] desire is in my heart is because you
[1:34:30] chose me before the foundation of the
[1:34:31] earth and because you chose me i believe
[1:34:33] you placed the desire in me you've
[1:34:35] placed the thirst in me and i'm
[1:34:36] thirsting like you like that like like
[1:34:39] that uh heart to the water brook and so
[1:34:41] forth i'm thirsting to you god and god i
[1:34:44] cannot change myself right the bible
[1:34:46] says very clearly no man by thinking can
[1:34:48] add a cuber to a statue i mean none of
[1:34:51] us can change ourselves
[1:34:53] we need god to change us
[1:34:55] so why do we beat ourselves up so much
[1:34:57] when we fail i can't change myself all
[1:34:59] we can do is repent
[1:35:02] that's how the keys clicked on the day
[1:35:03] of pentecost repent and be baptized and
[1:35:05] so forth and we need to come back and
[1:35:07] just say god i'm struggling god i'm
[1:35:09] battling god please help me i repent of
[1:35:12] it lord i've messed up again
[1:35:14] and tomorrow lord i've messed up again
[1:35:17] hallelujah but let's be real we want
[1:35:19] reality we want to meet god with reality
[1:35:23] walk and we know all the while he's with
[1:35:26] us he's got our back
[1:35:31] you know it's the reality is there's
[1:35:33] very few of us in the ranks of the
[1:35:34] message that did not make the exact same
[1:35:37] mistakes
[1:35:38] as those leaders that opposed the son of
[1:35:40] man when he was on earth the first time
[1:35:45] and what makes it worse is we knew
[1:35:47] better
[1:35:49] we heard the prophet preach we read in
[1:35:51] the bible where jesus speaks to the
[1:35:52] pharisees and so forth
[1:35:55] amen
[1:35:56] we don't have time to to read it but
[1:35:59] but jesus reprimanded the pharisees on
[1:36:01] so many things praying to be seen giving
[1:36:04] arms to be seen blowing a trumpet about
[1:36:07] it and so forth fasting to be seen
[1:36:09] walking around with long faces so people
[1:36:11] would think that they are serious
[1:36:14] keeping the traditions of man
[1:36:19] you can walk in this message and keep
[1:36:21] the traditions of man
[1:36:24] you can behave with a certain set of
[1:36:26] behaviors to be accepted in the group
[1:36:29] and have no relationship with god
[1:36:32] no relationship with jesus christ
[1:36:36] people want to be looked up by others
[1:36:38] people want to be called
[1:36:40] brother or rabbi or pastor or whatever
[1:36:43] it is
[1:36:44] people want to feel that they are the
[1:36:46] spiritual one in the group
[1:36:49] that's just human nature
[1:36:51] we did exactly the same thing as those
[1:36:53] pharisees did
[1:36:56] i'll just read one portion where jesus
[1:36:57] speaks to these pharisees
[1:37:01] he says but why weren't you scribes and
[1:37:02] pharisees hypocrites
[1:37:04] oh no there's that word
[1:37:07] we've seen so much of that and i'm not
[1:37:09] pointing a finger i'm pointing a finger
[1:37:11] right here i was there for years and
[1:37:13] years and years and years
[1:37:16] hypocrites for you shut up the kingdom
[1:37:18] of heaven against men for you neither go
[1:37:21] in yourselves neither suffer you them
[1:37:23] that i entering to go in we've done
[1:37:25] exactly that
[1:37:28] i'm struggling with my life
[1:37:30] right so now i criticize everyone else
[1:37:34] break them down put them out of the
[1:37:35] kingdom
[1:37:37] he says you suffer not yourself to go in
[1:37:39] and not them either
[1:37:40] i want to use scribes and pharisees
[1:37:42] hypocrites for you compass see and land
[1:37:45] to make one proselyte and when he is
[1:37:46] made you make him a twofold more the
[1:37:48] child of hell than yourselves
[1:37:52] want another one in my church want
[1:37:53] another one in my group want another one
[1:37:55] in my doctrine
[1:37:57] but what's the point
[1:37:59] wow unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:38:01] hypocrites for you by tithe of mint and
[1:38:03] anise and cumin and have omitted the
[1:38:06] weightier matters of the law in other
[1:38:07] words you look at the smallest little
[1:38:09] mistake in someone in someone's life
[1:38:12] but the bigger things i mean like loving
[1:38:15] god above all else like loving your
[1:38:17] brother above all else wow right wow
[1:38:20] leave it undone
[1:38:22] you blind guide which strain it in that
[1:38:24] and swallow a camel it's the same
[1:38:26] principle why won't you scribes and
[1:38:28] pharisees hypocrites for you may clean
[1:38:30] the outside of the cup and of the
[1:38:31] platter but within they are full of
[1:38:34] extortion and excess that's exactly what
[1:38:36] i spoke to earlier we're so we're so
[1:38:38] concerned about letting the church look
[1:38:40] good or letting our family look good or
[1:38:43] you know so that we can polish our image
[1:38:45] and says i am such a good pastor
[1:38:47] and they can be full of dead men's bones
[1:38:51] i'd rather my church look bad and i know
[1:38:54] that they are walking forward every day
[1:38:55] closer to christ than having a church
[1:38:58] that looks perfect
[1:39:00] but full of dead men's bones full of
[1:39:02] extortion and access
[1:39:05] now blind pharisees cleanse first that
[1:39:07] which is within the cup and platter that
[1:39:09] the outside of them may be clean also
[1:39:12] why if the inside is clean it will clean
[1:39:13] from the inside out like the dove that's
[1:39:16] that's got that hallelujah that oil that
[1:39:18] cleans from the inside
[1:39:20] hallelujah why won't you scribe and
[1:39:21] pharisees hypocrites for your like unto
[1:39:23] whiter sepulchers which indeed appear
[1:39:26] beautiful outward but are within full of
[1:39:28] dead men's bones and all of all
[1:39:30] uncleanness even so you also outwardly
[1:39:33] appear righteous unto men but within you
[1:39:36] are full of hypocrisy and iniquity
[1:39:38] i am sorry to say but i lived there for
[1:39:41] years
[1:39:44] tried my best to study the doctrine so i
[1:39:46] can speak with the bros and you know be
[1:39:49] up with the latest and greatest
[1:39:51] that's the honest truth and i'm sorry
[1:39:53] but there's many like me i know i'm not
[1:39:55] alone
[1:39:56] want to be seen to know the doctrine so
[1:39:58] you listen and you memorize and
[1:40:00] hey and i'm not saying anything about i
[1:40:02] love the word i love the open word i
[1:40:05] love revelation
[1:40:06] but not from the perspective of trying
[1:40:09] to show trying to keep up right wow
[1:40:12] and and at the same time you put up this
[1:40:15] front when you're with people and you
[1:40:16] live this perfect little i always call
[1:40:18] it the facebook effect everyone puts on
[1:40:20] their best pictures right
[1:40:22] but meantime back at the ranch before
[1:40:24] they came to church everyone there was a
[1:40:26] big bun fight in the family and mum
[1:40:28] yelled and that door slammed and
[1:40:30] everything and you come to church god
[1:40:32] bless you brother
[1:40:34] right
[1:40:35] i was only in our house
[1:40:37] right
[1:40:38] hallelujah
[1:40:40] praise god
[1:40:41] let's be real
[1:40:43] many of us are guilty
[1:40:45] on age level guilty on a church level
[1:40:48] guilty on an individual level guilty
[1:40:52] jesus summarized it like this he says
[1:40:53] this people draweth nigh unto me with
[1:40:55] their mouth and honoreth me with their
[1:40:57] lips but their heart
[1:40:59] and god in this relationship in this
[1:41:02] union with him is it is wanting our
[1:41:04] hearts he wants our love
[1:41:07] he wants to be our everything from here
[1:41:10] god doesn't god doesn't worry about the
[1:41:12] fact that we are struggling because he's
[1:41:14] got our back
[1:41:15] but he wants our hearts because he knows
[1:41:17] if he's got our hearts the rest will
[1:41:19] fall in line and over time
[1:41:22] amen
[1:41:23] that's the crux of the matter
[1:41:25] we can have the theology without the
[1:41:27] reality
[1:41:29] the understanding but our hearts is
[1:41:31] somewhere else
[1:41:35] now so far if we're honest
[1:41:38] we can say lord please forgive me i'm
[1:41:40] sorry
[1:41:41] and his responses be strong and
[1:41:43] courageous i've got your back
[1:41:46] you're forgiven
[1:41:47] because you didn't sin willfully you
[1:41:49] were drawn away and trapped into your
[1:41:51] into those things because of your
[1:41:53] humanness
[1:41:54] how are we doing for time brother jason
[1:41:56] i have no idea
[1:41:57] okay it won't be too much longer
[1:42:00] and and i want to say again we've had a
[1:42:02] change of ministry dick
[1:42:06] amen
[1:42:07] we've had a change in administration
[1:42:09] dick
[1:42:11] but what about the change of attitude
[1:42:14] amen
[1:42:16] so far we can be all on board
[1:42:19] but we need the change of attitude
[1:42:22] and you know what i find when i speak
[1:42:24] along these terms many times people say
[1:42:25] ah brother that's the milk of the word
[1:42:27] come on give us something strong we you
[1:42:29] know we want to speak about the seventh
[1:42:30] seal well i am.
[1:42:34] i'm speaking about the union
[1:42:36] i'm speaking about the marriage of jesus
[1:42:38] christ i'm speaking about the reality
[1:42:40] walk amen
[1:42:42] hallelujah
[1:42:45] but instead of reaching out in love
[1:42:46] instead of saying to your children to
[1:42:48] young people i've got your back we've
[1:42:50] criticized we've judged we've put
[1:42:52] pressures we've ruled and threatened by
[1:42:55] fear
[1:42:56] i read that opening scripture again i
[1:42:58] just i just love it oh no it looks like
[1:43:00] i skipped over that let me just quickly
[1:43:02] read that please forgive me
[1:43:04] he says people have always fussed at me
[1:43:05] because i struck so hard at
[1:43:07] organizations oh i love this whoa this
[1:43:09] is a good quote this is
[1:43:12] it isn't the people in there that i'm
[1:43:14] striking at it's that dominating spirit
[1:43:17] that makes the people think that
[1:43:22] we are the people
[1:43:26] how's that
[1:43:29] the dominating spirit
[1:43:31] that makes people think
[1:43:33] we're it.
[1:43:36] that's a spirit of denomination
[1:43:39] that's a nicolithian spirit when we lift
[1:43:41] ourselves up above others
[1:43:44] isn't that something
[1:43:46] anyway back to isaiah
[1:43:49] we read fear not for thou shalt not be
[1:43:51] ashamed neither be thou confounded for
[1:43:53] thou shalt not be put to shame
[1:43:56] and and remember the context now
[1:43:58] although you've messed up although
[1:44:00] you've made so many mistakes although
[1:44:01] you've failed so many times now to get
[1:44:03] back up again
[1:44:04] you will not be ashamed
[1:44:06] for thou shalt forget the shame of thy
[1:44:08] youth and shall not remember the
[1:44:10] reproach of thy widowhood anymore for
[1:44:12] thy maker now under the seventh seal now
[1:44:14] thou maker is thy husband the lord of
[1:44:17] hosts is his name and thy redeemer the
[1:44:19] holy one of israel the god of the whole
[1:44:21] earth shall he be called
[1:44:23] that's the thing
[1:44:25] let's focus in our relationship with him
[1:44:27] and he will take care of the rest
[1:44:29] i'm not saying that he's not going to
[1:44:30] retire to retire you to spend time on
[1:44:32] your knees in prayer i'm not saying he's
[1:44:35] not gonna require you to repent of the
[1:44:36] things that you do wrong i'm not saying
[1:44:38] he's not gonna require you to desire to
[1:44:40] do the right things he requires those
[1:44:42] things
[1:44:43] i mean but at the same time he's saying
[1:44:46] i am your husband and i stand in for you
[1:44:50] and ty you know what brother branham
[1:44:51] says he makes a statement he says he
[1:44:54] says about husbands and wives and i
[1:44:55] don't want to get dragged too much into
[1:44:57] that but just this thought he says about
[1:44:59] husbands he says remember brother she
[1:45:02] will never be held responsible for what
[1:45:04] you do but you are held responsible for
[1:45:07] what she does
[1:45:08] now let's take that to the spiritual
[1:45:10] he
[1:45:11] is held responsible for my mistakes
[1:45:14] hallelujah wow
[1:45:16] there's nothing more wonderful than that
[1:45:18] in the world
[1:45:20] he went to the cross for my mistakes
[1:45:22] he took it upon himself
[1:45:24] brother braham says he went to the cross
[1:45:26] as sinner
[1:45:27] that's right he says god wouldn't have
[1:45:30] wouldn't have judged him if he was
[1:45:31] righteous
[1:45:33] he went on the cross as sinner
[1:45:35] with your sins and mine
[1:45:37] hallelujah
[1:45:39] those sins are paid for
[1:45:41] by the blood of jesus christ
[1:45:45] so we should be saying in my
[1:45:47] relationship with others
[1:45:50] i will treat you
[1:45:51] in that way
[1:45:53] where in the way i treat you i don't
[1:45:55] even let you remember that you made a
[1:45:57] mistake against me
[1:45:59] and the way i treat you i will not even
[1:46:01] let you remind you of the failings and
[1:46:04] the faults and the weaknesses
[1:46:07] hallelujah
[1:46:12] but the wrong approach
[1:46:15] never
[1:46:16] creates
[1:46:17] disciples
[1:46:20] the approach of cracking the whip
[1:46:22] raising the bar
[1:46:24] judging criticizing all it does is it
[1:46:26] makes a bunch of message robots
[1:46:31] where we follow a set of rules
[1:46:34] where we follow a certain behavior that
[1:46:36] is going to keep us safe good without
[1:46:39] any reality
[1:46:40] so here's where those video clips in
[1:46:42] come in that my brother referred to and
[1:46:44] let's see if it works there if it
[1:46:46] doesn't
[1:46:49] now look at this this is a this is not a
[1:46:52] christian one this is a robot that they
[1:46:54] designed in japan i think
[1:46:57] that now as you can see on the text
[1:46:59] there you can hire this robot to come
[1:47:02] perform a funeral for you and it costs
[1:47:04] you a whole lot less than actually
[1:47:05] paying for a for a priest
[1:47:16] we can create message robots
[1:47:19] i'm sorry to say it but we can so easily
[1:47:21] become message robots
[1:47:24] let's go to this next one praise the
[1:47:26] lord that's working too
[1:47:30] this is a much more sophisticated robot
[1:47:32] look at that
[1:47:34] wow
[1:47:39] i'll just say this
[1:47:41] please don't stone me but with
[1:47:43] artificial intelligence you can teach
[1:47:45] the message doctrine to a robot
[1:47:50] wow you absolutely can the technology is
[1:47:52] there
[1:47:54] you can ask this robot questions about
[1:47:56] the message and he can give you really
[1:47:57] good answers
[1:47:59] no revelation
[1:48:01] not the application
[1:48:02] but the doctrine you can teach to a
[1:48:04] robot
[1:48:05] you can teach a robot well a robot
[1:48:08] doesn't have hair that can grow long
[1:48:10] right but you can teach a robot to do's
[1:48:12] and don'ts
[1:48:14] but you cannot have a relationship with
[1:48:16] a robot
[1:48:17] now this one is probably not going to
[1:48:18] work oh it is working can you make sure
[1:48:20] the sound is up
[1:48:25] this is now a roman catholic one
[1:48:28] [Music]
[1:48:35] hi and welcome it's nice to meet you
[1:48:38] would you like to be blessed by a female
[1:48:40] or a middle class
[1:48:44] fine
[1:48:45] which one do you need
[1:49:00] may the god of hope fill you with all
[1:49:02] joy and peace in believing
[1:49:05] so that you may abound in hope by the
[1:49:09] power of the holy spirit
[1:49:20] go forth in the peace of god
[1:49:25] would you like to print out your
[1:49:27] messages
[1:49:52] i guess you get the point right
[1:49:56] you cannot make disciples with the wrong
[1:49:58] approach
[1:50:00] you can make robots
[1:50:03] and and if i have to be honest i was a
[1:50:06] message robot for years
[1:50:10] but what we need is reality
[1:50:12] and we cannot be message robots and be
[1:50:15] the wife of jesus christ at the same
[1:50:17] time
[1:50:21] the problem is
[1:50:22] if the elders and the leaders and the
[1:50:24] parents operate as robots
[1:50:27] how about the poor children
[1:50:31] if we just rule by fear threaten with
[1:50:34] hell
[1:50:35] without presenting the love of christ
[1:50:37] with open arms
[1:50:39] that says i've got your back we make
[1:50:41] robots
[1:50:44] and robots can be taught knowledge
[1:50:46] robots can be taught the right behavior
[1:50:50] and and
[1:50:52] it's so important to notice that when
[1:50:54] god dealt with joshua and he said keep
[1:50:56] my word lift it up live it teach it
[1:51:01] he also said i've got your back
[1:51:04] be strong be very courageous i am with
[1:51:07] you every step you give i'm with you
[1:51:10] can we say that to our churches can you
[1:51:12] say that you are children can we say
[1:51:13] that you have families can we say that
[1:51:15] to those around us when we see them
[1:51:16] making a mistake
[1:51:19] we keep the word but i'm i've got your

[1:51:44] you'll make mistakes you're going to

[1:53:03] with you wheresoever thou goest i've got
[1:53:06] your back
[1:53:08] when you make mistakes even though you
[1:53:10] may pay for it because of the of the
[1:53:12] principle of sowing and reaping i've
[1:53:13] still got your back even though you may
[1:53:16] fail me bitterly at times i've still got
[1:53:18] your back
[1:53:19] amen is that a reality for you this
[1:53:21] morning
[1:53:22] that is god's attitude to us

[1:53:29] we're speaking about reality now
[1:53:32] brothers and sisters
[1:53:34] we have seen way too much message robot
[1:53:37] antics

[1:54:22] i believe that god wants to bring these
[1:54:24] things to our attention because it's
[1:54:25] adoption time

[1:54:30] the time of the threefold purpose where
[1:54:32] he's becoming one with his bride
[1:54:34] god wants his word to be a reality in us

[2:02:13] what to say after a sermon like that i
[2:02:14] made so many points
[2:02:17] wrote down so many things you know i i
[2:02:20] had a
[2:02:20] great appreciation today
[2:02:24] for a real pastoral ministry
[2:02:26] and i
[2:02:27] whenever i go
[2:02:29] abroad
[2:02:30] i just always as soon as i get up i tell
[2:02:33] the people no i'm a pastor so i'm just
[2:02:35] going to be a pastor it doesn't matter
[2:02:36] that i'm in a foreign field and the
[2:02:39] pastor that's that i'm there with has
[2:02:40] confidence
[2:02:42] and uh you know brother
[2:02:44] already and i discussed today that i
[2:02:46] wanted him just to take his liberty and
[2:02:49] i appreciated a shepherd's heart
[2:02:51] today
[2:02:53] that is so in line friends with the with
[2:02:56] the philosophy of this church and you
[2:02:59] know we're all in this together aren't
[2:03:01] we i told her that that last night i
[2:03:03] said if you ask my church what is
[2:03:05] brother jason what's his main philosophy
[2:03:07] they'd say we're all in this thing
[2:03:08] together amen it's all for one and one
[2:03:11] for all i'm not interested in being a
[2:03:13] message robot
[2:03:14] [Music]
[2:03:16] and that's amazing you can get a robot
[2:03:18] to do anything you ai can actually he
[2:03:20] can he can quote the message back to you
[2:03:22] but when it comes to living that life
[2:03:26] oh my goodness friends i thought about
[2:03:30] i thought brother all right how
[2:03:31] encouraging
[2:03:33] it must have been
[2:03:35] to joshua
[2:03:37] you know these people
[2:03:39] who think they can point to human
[2:03:41] frailties in william branham and somehow
[2:03:43] that's going to discourage us
[2:03:46] how encouraging it was to joshua
[2:03:48] that he could see moses with his human
[2:03:51] frailties he could see moses make
[2:03:54] mistakes and yet god was still with him
[2:03:57] and god never changed the covenant and
[2:03:59] they did come out of egypt
[2:04:01] hallelujah amen and now god is saying to
[2:04:03] joshua the same way i was with him i'll
[2:04:05] be with you hallelujah the same way god
[2:04:08] was with william branham he'll be with
[2:04:09] you bride
[2:04:10] can you receive that today
[2:04:13] then fear not don't fear anything go
[2:04:16] forward
[2:04:18] oh
[2:04:21] god will have your back
[2:04:25] even when you fail
[2:04:27] as long as your heart stays for him
[2:04:32] amen
[2:04:34] you know i um
[2:04:36] the whole thing about choice
[2:04:39] you know it's interesting because as
[2:04:41] brother as brother already begin to talk
[2:04:42] about becoming a a love slave a slave to
[2:04:46] love
[2:04:47] the the law it's actually the law of
[2:04:50] liberty
[2:04:52] it's a law of liberty
[2:04:54] because
[2:04:55] you actually go beyond
[2:04:58] you know it it
[2:04:59] the the you make a choice
[2:05:02] you know i i i
[2:05:04] when sister debbie and i the the closer
[2:05:07] we got in our relationship i was
[2:05:09] choosing her i was choosing her i was
[2:05:10] choosing her but you know on on our
[2:05:13] wedding day
[2:05:14] our relationship had evolved to where it
[2:05:17] had went beyond choice i could now not
[2:05:19] choose otherwise
[2:05:22] she was the only girl for me and and and
[2:05:24] there was no choice i had went beyond
[2:05:26] choice it had become to that level
[2:05:29] oh i'm here to tell you something
[2:05:31] friends i can't choose otherwise than
[2:05:32] christ it's in my heart it's in my whole
[2:05:35] being it's all i want in life it's all i
[2:05:37] care about is to be a child of the king
[2:05:41] a servant of the most high god
[2:05:44] to
[2:05:44] to enjoy his righteousness and his
[2:05:47] holiness and to know
[2:05:49] that the same way i feel about him
[2:05:52] is uh just a shadow of how strong he
[2:05:54] feels about me
[2:05:56] and no matter
[2:05:58] he
[2:05:59] he
[2:06:00] god will have your back
[2:06:03] even when you fail
[2:06:04] as long as your heart stays for him
[2:06:08] because you you can have theology
[2:06:10] without reality
[2:06:13] you know friends
[2:06:14] there are sadly there are churches that
[2:06:17] if that's the way you you want it
[2:06:20] there's congregations for you

[2:06:30] i want the reality we cannot be
[2:06:34] robots you just remember this
[2:06:36] you cannot be robots
