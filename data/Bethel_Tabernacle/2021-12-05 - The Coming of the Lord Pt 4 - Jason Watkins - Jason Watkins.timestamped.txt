[26:11] chapter 11
[26:13] and we're going to catch a couple of
[26:15] verses in revelation sorry revelation
[26:18] chapter 11.
[26:19] we're going to continue
[26:21] in my little series here on the coming
[26:24] of the lord
[26:25] uh probably today and maybe one more uh
[26:28] segment we'll do it we'll see
[26:31] amen we'll see
[26:33] amen praise the lord i never really know
[26:35] tell you the truth if i ever sound
[26:37] unsure it's because i am
[26:40] if i sound unsure that's only because i
[26:42] am
[26:43] so uh but we just we just go along as
[26:46] the lord breaks it reveals it to us
[26:48] i don't never get to choose what i
[26:50] preach
[26:51] hope you believe that i don't never get
[26:53] to choose that and there's i could
[26:55] choose now no kidding i could choose but
[26:58] i don't choose because i know better
[27:00] than to try that amen i want what he has
[27:05] amen i made the lord a promise years ago
[27:08] that i would never do that that i would
[27:09] never if i knew it was his will i would
[27:11] do it
[27:12] um
[27:13] there'd be nothing death nothing would
[27:15] keep me from it if i knew if i knew it
[27:17] was his will in his word i would do it
[27:20] no matter what it cost me
[27:22] and um
[27:23] knowingly
[27:25] not knowingly have i ever broken that
[27:27] vow to the lord amen now sometimes i've
[27:29] missed the will of god
[27:31] amen amen sometimes the will of god can
[27:33] be a little obscure trying to see it but
[27:36] buddy you miss it one time and you will
[27:40] you want to you want to know how to know
[27:41] the will of god miss it and you will
[27:44] know right quick uh that you are in left
[27:47] field and you've gone off center line so
[27:50] amen praise the lord but uh but if i
[27:52] ever knew it was his will and the lord i
[27:54] always have to see it in his word he
[27:56] knows that's how i think i know that
[27:58] this word heavens and earth will pass
[28:00] away but this is what he sent me that
[28:02] will never pass away
[28:03] and i know if i can see it here i i
[28:06] trust this more than i trust an angelic
[28:08] visit
[28:09] i trust this more than an open vision i
[28:11] trust this more than anything see
[28:13] because uh an angel could appear to mean
[28:16] it be a be an evil spirit disguised as
[28:18] an angel see i could see a vision you
[28:20] could have a dream brother branham talks
[28:22] about that
[28:23] um got some notes for that working in a
[28:26] future sermon about gifts and operations
[28:28] of gifts in the church and brother
[28:30] branham just goes into such detail to
[28:32] talk about that how that we have gifts
[28:35] but we have to be careful he said
[28:37] because satan is super sly he can come
[28:40] in take a gift take a preaching gift
[28:42] take a we had beautiful specials here
[28:45] this morning you know god can get in
[28:47] singers
[28:49] the enemy can get in singers
[28:51] god can get in preachers the enemy can
[28:53] get in preachers god can get in an
[28:54] audience the enemy can get in an
[28:55] audience
[28:57] musicians singers song leaders preachers
[29:01] officers laity see so we have to always
[29:05] check it by the word and the lord knows
[29:08] that once i see it in the word and it's
[29:10] perfect faith and i'm fearless with it
[29:12] i'll face the whole world
[29:14] face every devil wants to step up i will
[29:16] absolutely do that because i know once i
[29:19] see it in the word i have perfect faith
[29:21] that's it for me it's an end to all
[29:24] strife it's an end to all discussion
[29:26] amen and so we want to be able to have
[29:30] everything established in god's word and
[29:33] so i'm looking to him today to do that
[29:35] uh i don't stand here with any certain
[29:38] um agenda in my heart i'm only here
[29:41] today to continue this thought so it's
[29:44] been thrilling to me i've enjoyed it i
[29:46] trust you have as well to see
[29:49] that revelation 10
[29:51] has meant a lot more to me in the last
[29:53] several weeks than ever at any point in
[29:56] my life because i see the greater
[29:57] purpose of it
[29:59] not the greater purpose of it but a
[30:01] greater purpose of it there's many great
[30:04] purposes
[30:05] but um
[30:06] what god has done we were preaching on
[30:08] it especially drilling down on it last
[30:10] sunday to show
[30:12] that really friends revelation 10
[30:15] came to bring a bride into the into the
[30:18] image of christ his very image
[30:21] his very image his precise image and at
[30:25] the end and she's the final voice to the
[30:27] final age i said that you last week
[30:28] remember that there's more verses
[30:31] in revelation 10 referring to you
[30:34] than refer to william branham
[30:37] he was the necessary element in that
[30:39] seventh verse because god's never going
[30:41] to come and bring a revelation to a
[30:43] group
[30:44] he doesn't operate that way he gets a
[30:46] prophet he gives him his message and the
[30:48] prophet takes it to the people you're
[30:50] right you follow that so he was a
[30:52] necessary element standing there in
[30:54] verse 7 when the mighty angel
[30:57] not not the strong angel brother branham
[31:00] was the strong angel of revelation 5
[31:02] standing in verse 7 when the mighty
[31:04] angel of revelation 10 standing that
[31:07] that brother i'm standing there in verse
[31:09] 7 of chapter 10 when the mighty angel
[31:12] which was christ came but after that
[31:15] verses 8 verses 9 verses 10 verses 11
[31:18] that's all you
[31:20] see
[31:21] and verse and then chapter 11 one and
[31:24] two especially verse one we're gonna
[31:26] where we've been showing you how that
[31:28] that's the measurable perfection that
[31:30] that's the living tabernacle of the
[31:32] living god that that that revelation 11
[31:36] verse 1
[31:37] validates all of chapter 10
[31:41] that christ was true the messenger was
[31:43] true the message is true and verse 1 of
[31:45] chapter 11 proves it
[31:47] because she was literally the finished
[31:49] product the measurable perfection and it
[31:52] was measurable
[31:54] because the bride comes into his image
[31:58] it's not a metaphor she literally comes
[32:00] into his image
[32:02] perfectly amen so so we're looking
[32:05] further at it today and we want to take
[32:08] these requests to the lord let's let's
[32:11] have our reading in chapter 11 verse 1.
[32:14] and we'll just take this a couple of
[32:16] verses here and there was given me
[32:19] a read like unto a rod and the angel
[32:22] stood saying rise and measure the temple
[32:25] of god and the altar and them that
[32:27] worship therein but the court which is
[32:30] without the temple leave it out and
[32:32] measure it not for it is given unto the
[32:35] gentiles and the holy city shall they
[32:37] tread under foot forty in two months
[32:40] amen let's pray
[32:44] father
[32:45] i stand here this morning lord
[32:48] depending on you
[32:49] relying on you
[32:52] master this thought has been burning in
[32:54] my heart but lord it'll take you to
[32:57] bring it to the people today and i pray
[32:59] you'll grant it father we stand here

[35:09] we're looking forward to that it's a
[35:10] little bit scaled back from what we
[35:12] normally do we just had the uh so much
[35:15] going on we had the youth camp and that
[35:18] was such a major undertaking and then we
[35:20] immediately started on church
[35:21] renovations and that's been quite taxing
[35:24] and so
[35:25] so but we still love to do that we love
[35:28] to get together i love being around
[35:30] god's family my every time i get around
[35:32] a
[35:33] a church fellowship like that it starts
[35:35] reminds me of the millennium brother don
[35:38] donald it reminds me of the millennium i
[35:40] think my won't the millennium be
[35:42] wonderful when this is every day
[35:44] hallelujah so we're going to do that i
[35:46] think that's on the 11th and we're
[35:48] looking forward to that so
[35:50] amen all right praise the lord we want
[35:53] now to by the grace of god start in here
[35:56] from where we've been and i've already
[35:58] kind of gave you a preliminary well i
[35:59] had you standing
[36:01] so i want to
[36:03] uh read some not quotes in their
[36:05] entirety i have a powerpoint that i'm
[36:08] going to get to shortly and it has the
[36:10] entire quote of several screens that i
[36:13] want to read but on these quotes i'm
[36:15] just going to
[36:17] skip along and read some statements and
[36:20] some one-liners here i'll give you the
[36:22] message in the reference so you can make
[36:24] a note of it for those of you who like
[36:26] to go back
[36:28] these are wonderful sermons from brother
[36:29] branham and and we're
[36:32] thinking now today
[36:34] about
[36:35] the eternal realms
[36:37] because
[36:38] you know as we think about the brad
[36:40] because as we've been showing you
[36:43] how that
[36:45] you know
[36:47] when when we are
[36:49] shown to be
[36:51] that we are the living temple
[36:55] of the living
[36:56] god now that's a mouthful
[36:59] i mean that's rare anybody can say that
[37:02] but talk is cheap
[37:03] say
[37:04] well
[37:05] then i'll make sure that i live in such
[37:08] a way that i earned that that wouldn't
[37:09] even do you any good either
[37:11] that this all comes back to god's
[37:14] election
[37:15] and i'm here to tell you something
[37:16] friends that
[37:18] what you're what you have done
[37:21] when you have given your heart to the
[37:24] lord as brother branham said you didn't
[37:26] one day come to an altar and repent and
[37:30] oh wow you became a son of god or you
[37:32] became a daughter of god no brother
[37:34] branham says no you only found out you
[37:36] actually had always been from the mind
[37:38] of god
[37:39] and now by the new birth of the holy
[37:41] spirit in your life you're now
[37:43] cooperating in the vision
[37:48] do you know sometimes and and more often
[37:50] now of late but over the last number of
[37:53] years particular people in this
[37:55] congregation uh members of my family
[37:58] which you are included as members of my
[38:00] family i am oftentimes praying for you
[38:04] with these words and this is how the
[38:06] lord inspired me to pray
[38:09] for all of my loved ones lord today
[38:13] today this day may you take brother and
[38:16] sister so and so and all of their family
[38:19] and this day may you bring them just a
[38:22] little closer to the image that you saw
[38:26] of them before the foundation of the
[38:28] world now i pray that because and i pray
[38:30] that for me i pray that for myself
[38:32] because otherwise there'd be too many
[38:35] things in my own experience that would
[38:37] disappoint me and hinder my faith
[38:39] there'd be too many things that would
[38:41] disappoint you
[38:43] there would be things i'd get
[38:44] disappointed in watching you there'd be
[38:46] things disappointed you're watching me
[38:48] but if we just say lord whatever that
[38:50] vision is just bring us closer to that
[38:54] i'm not gonna tell you how to do it i'm
[38:56] not here i just say lord by whatever
[38:58] means necessary bring me bring this
[39:01] church bring our families into the
[39:04] vision that you had of us before the
[39:06] foundation of the world amen
[39:10] now that can go good or bad depending on
[39:11] your resistance
[39:15] you can you can make it easier on
[39:17] yourself or you don't you don't have to
[39:19] god won't force you to make it easier
[39:21] but you are
[39:22] it's like i've told the story you know
[39:24] here's here's the bad guy in the bar you
[39:27] know in the saloon and the marshal comes
[39:29] in with all of his his
[39:31] his deputies and they surround him
[39:33] you know all right ringo you're going to
[39:34] jail
[39:35] now listen son
[39:37] you can go to jail walking upright like
[39:40] a man or you can get pistol whipped to
[39:43] the ground and drug behind a horse it
[39:45] doesn't matter to me but you are going
[39:47] to jail
[39:48] and so
[39:49] i just say today don't don't get drunk
[39:52] behind a horse just go ahead and submit
[39:54] to the holy spirit in your life i
[39:57] promise you'll you'll like it better if
[39:59] you do it that way
[40:01] and so so we find out then that to be
[40:04] this living image this living tabernacle
[40:08] means that there is a bride
[40:10] on the earth at the end time who
[40:13] literally have perfect faith in every
[40:15] word of god
[40:17] for
[40:18] their life
[40:20] because it's you know
[40:22] gentiles have a thing of saying
[40:25] have this kind of thinking
[40:27] do you know do you know something and
[40:29] someone would say
[40:31] yes i know it i know
[40:33] and a gentile would say okay let me hear
[40:36] you recite it back to me and if you can
[40:38] explain it and recite it then gentiles
[40:42] will tend to say okay he knows it go sit
[40:44] down next
[40:45] but hebrews are not like that the jewish
[40:48] people have always had it looking at it
[40:50] like this if if you can live it then
[40:54] i'll say you know it
[40:57] if you actually if it becomes a living
[40:59] reality and it's not just a head
[41:01] knowledge but it's actually a living
[41:04] word out of your life then then the jews
[41:06] will say okay he knows it see and this
[41:09] is this is remember this is how john
[41:13] being a jew
[41:14] is speaking to you when he uses that
[41:17] word that that that that you actually
[41:19] can know god in this way that it goes
[41:23] more than just a head knowledge that it
[41:24] actually when your life is an amen
[41:29] when your life is a is a voice of the
[41:33] word you're the final voice to the final
[41:35] age that's not that's not the the shout
[41:38] god doesn't need me
[41:40] or you to go re
[41:43] interpret the shout and give it out to
[41:46] the world it's already on 1200 tapes
[41:49] it's already verified vindicated and
[41:51] went around the world god doesn't need
[41:53] that redone what god needs now is for a
[41:56] people to become the living voice of
[41:59] that message that's what i want friends
[42:02] that's what i want more than anything
[42:03] that's my constant prayer that's what
[42:06] that's what will drive sleep from me if
[42:08] i feel that that there's more areas i
[42:10] that i could surrender and i won't what
[42:13] a wretched man i feel at that time and i
[42:15] go to god and say lord take over this
[42:18] man take over this flesh and cause me as
[42:22] you promised in your word
[42:24] cause me to believe your statutes
[42:26] cause me said i'll put my spirit in you
[42:29] and i will cause you to keep my statutes
[42:34] so this living image of the living word
[42:36] there's a whole lot i could say about it
[42:39] today but
[42:40] and i
[42:41] i grappled terrible
[42:43] terribly with
[42:45] two ways i wanted to go and i wanted to
[42:47] marry them together and i don't think
[42:49] the lord's gonna have it and so
[42:51] i just finally gave up trying and and
[42:53] i'm just gonna go with this in angle of
[42:56] it today and i'll catch that angle if
[42:59] and when the lord allows that good
[43:02] so
[43:03] so
[43:04] brother branham talks about now because
[43:07] i want to talk about these ethereal
[43:09] realms and these eternal realms and
[43:10] you're really going to have to stay with
[43:12] me tight because we're going to kind of
[43:14] think outside the box today that be okay
[43:18] you're eternal beings right
[43:20] children of god
[43:21] see don't don't don't live in just the
[43:24] three-dimensional world that you know
[43:26] the world presents to you there's seven
[43:28] dimensions actually and you realize
[43:30] today that because you we had a prophet
[43:33] that come and understood these realms
[43:36] having been caught in many of them
[43:38] himself having traveled in them
[43:42] you understand this was a prophet who
[43:44] traveled who went into the fifth
[43:46] dimension and came back who went into
[43:50] the sixth dimension and came back who
[43:52] operated discernment through the
[43:55] ethereal waves of the fourth dimension
[43:57] and could stand in one place and be
[43:59] completely somewhere else while he's
[44:01] standing right here
[44:04] so i'm here to tell you that science
[44:06] today studies all of this
[44:08] and you are here today
[44:11] and it is an absolute fact it's not
[44:15] wishful thinking we're not patting
[44:16] ourselves on the back but i'm here to
[44:18] tell you you understand far more
[44:23] far and running away more
[44:25] about the world and reality and nature
[44:29] and the creation than all the scientists
[44:32] in their ivy league schools put
[44:34] together amen
[44:36] they they look at things and they are
[44:39] puzzled by things that we happen to
[44:41] already know
[44:43] we're smarter than the scientists
[44:45] that's not an arrogant statement it's a
[44:46] matter of statement of fact i'm smarter
[44:49] than astronauts
[44:50] they they've seen things but i know what
[44:53] they're looking at
[44:55] and i know what's even behind what
[44:57] they're looking at amen
[44:59] because when we talk about being the
[45:01] temple of the lord well what does that
[45:03] even mean
[45:04] am i going to be a mortar building brick
[45:06] and mortar building no
[45:08] see then we're inside of a building and
[45:10] this we call it the house of god but
[45:12] this is a building that could be
[45:13] flattened by a storm tomorrow that
[45:15] wouldn't that wouldn't destroy the house
[45:17] of god
[45:19] you understand you you're the house of
[45:21] god but you could perish before tomorrow
[45:24] but that wouldn't stop the house of god
[45:26] from being in existence
[45:27] see
[45:28] so now i want you to go with me today
[45:32] and i and i and i think maybe young
[45:34] people will particularly be intrigued by
[45:36] some of this today but some of the
[45:38] old-timers as well no doubt brother
[45:40] branham with his
[45:42] understanding of these realms he comes
[45:44] in the series demonology
[45:47] in the religious realm he first does the
[45:49] physical realm and then he goes into the
[45:52] religious realm
[45:55] and beginning is 1953 and beginning in
[45:58] paragraph 191 he said here let's give a
[46:01] little picture a little minute little
[46:03] mental picture now i'm not going to read
[46:05] all of the quote he goes to a board
[46:08] and he draws
[46:10] a stream of life and you can catch this
[46:12] from the description if you go home
[46:13] listen to the tape yourself
[46:15] and he says now in this little channel
[46:17] here he just draws a channel across the
[46:20] board
[46:21] in this channel dwells mortal beings you
[46:25] and i and and and and he talks about how
[46:29] that you know in this channel of life as
[46:32] it stands today it's all black lines and
[46:35] folly and evil and everything of human
[46:39] existence is represented in his channel
[46:41] he drew on a board he said and all that
[46:43] blackness and all those streaks of evil
[46:45] going through that he said but now every
[46:47] once in a while he said you'll see a
[46:49] little white light in there and that's
[46:51] god's family moving through the channels
[46:54] of life with the rest of humanity
[46:57] all right you getting a mental picture
[46:59] already i hope
[47:00] so he says
[47:01] so he says now this channel
[47:05] is influenced and in one sense he says
[47:07] from two sides which makes you think he
[47:09] drew a channel like this and it's left
[47:11] and right if you keep going on you
[47:13] realize he drew it like this and when
[47:14] he's talking about sides versus sides
[47:17] he's meaning above and below all right
[47:19] he makes that's extremely clear i don't
[47:21] have time to read it all this morning
[47:23] but he says now this channel of life is
[47:26] influenced all right and now he he will
[47:30] go through that sermon and other sermons
[47:33] that i'm not didn't even put on my notes
[47:35] today but there's several places he
[47:36] talks about this how that there's three
[47:40] realms
[47:41] above this channel of existence you live
[47:44] in and there's three realms below the
[47:47] channel that you live in and he says
[47:49] you're you're influenced in this channel
[47:52] by above or below
[47:54] amen now
[47:56] educated people would go well you can't
[47:58] prove that in a laboratory but i can
[48:00] look out on the street and prove it
[48:03] i can look in my own life and prove it
[48:05] see
[48:06] and so he talks about how that above
[48:09] this channel where we have these light
[48:11] time and matter where those are the
[48:13] first three dimensions we contact and
[48:15] the fourth dimension is the ethereal
[48:17] waves and microwaves and radio waves and
[48:19] tv signals and things like that and
[48:21] that's where brother branham said every
[48:22] fifth dimension disease comes through
[48:25] comes through that fourth dimension so
[48:27] be careful what you're gazing at
[48:30] be careful what you're giving yourself
[48:32] access to in that fourth dimension
[48:34] because fifth dimension sicknesses and
[48:36] demons come through that
[48:38] to go into this realm okay i'm not going
[48:40] to explain that further i just always
[48:42] went i better be careful
[48:44] all right
[48:45] and so so above this middle channel you
[48:49] have the realm of the redeemed where
[48:52] brother branham went to in a sixth
[48:54] dimension
[48:55] and he held people and talked to them
[48:57] and conversed with them and they were
[48:59] real they weren't imagined they weren't
[49:01] a metaphor they they were real
[49:03] so so today all of our loved ones who
[49:06] have died didn't die
[49:09] amen
[49:10] because the for the christian jesus said
[49:13] you will never die
[49:15] this body gets to a point where it can
[49:17] no longer sustain life and it it and
[49:20] this and the spirit of life exits
[49:22] because the body sick or old or whatever
[49:24] can no longer sustain life and the body
[49:27] perishes but the real you lives on and
[49:29] and brother brandon went there and
[49:31] talked to them
[49:32] people he knew that he had visited with
[49:35] in the earth all right i've got to move
[49:36] faster
[49:38] so so from there above that is angels
[49:41] and above that is god all right then
[49:44] below it is that fifth dimension of the
[49:47] the souls of the damned who
[49:50] left the earth and what what happened
[49:52] was they they didn't have the blood of
[49:56] jesus
[49:57] to go
[49:58] all the way into the sixth dimension
[50:00] but their time on they couldn't come
[50:03] back here
[50:04] because their time was all used up
[50:07] and they get hung
[50:08] in that fifth dimension they can't come
[50:11] back here they can't go on into the
[50:13] presence of the redeemed
[50:15] and they're hung there at a nightmarish
[50:18] tight prisons not the lake of fire but
[50:21] it isn't but it is it is described as as
[50:25] a as a terrible place brother branham
[50:27] said the worst nightmare you could ever
[50:28] imagine and jesus gives the parable of
[50:31] the man saying i'm tormented in this
[50:32] flame we know by the bible that that no
[50:35] one is committed to the lake of fire
[50:37] without getting their fair trial and so
[50:39] people are held there
[50:41] bound over for trial now that's a legal
[50:43] term we understand people go get put in
[50:45] jail and he's bound over for trial he's
[50:49] locked up and they're not going to give
[50:50] him any bail he's just bound over for
[50:51] trial and there have been people bound
[50:54] over for trial there for thousands of
[50:55] years
[50:57] waiting for waiting for i doubt they're
[51:00] even very much recognizable as a human
[51:02] probably the madness that they've
[51:03] slipped into at this point i don't know
[51:05] i've never been there don't want to go
[51:08] but but then on down below
[51:11] that realm is the realm of demons and
[51:13] then on down below that is satan himself
[51:15] and so brother branham says we're in the
[51:17] middle and we're caught i told sister
[51:19] gene the other day i said when people
[51:21] ask me do you believe in purgatory i
[51:22] said yep i'm in it now
[51:26] i'm in the middle this is the closest
[51:27] thing to purgatory i'll ever ever want
[51:30] to go i'm here to tell you something
[51:31] friends i'm going up i'm not going down
[51:33] now that's also not a metaphor up and
[51:36] down are real jesus went up
[51:39] after he first went down
[51:41] and went into the lower part so i don't
[51:42] want to get ahead of myself but we're
[51:44] influenced in our lives from one of
[51:47] these two realms below above or below
[51:51] you disremember that teenagers
[51:54] when you feel a certain leadership and a
[51:56] guidance or anybody
[51:58] ask yourself where is this influence
[52:00] coming from if it's something that it
[52:03] will improve
[52:04] your connection to god i'm pretty sure
[52:07] the devil would never influence you to
[52:08] do it if it's something that would draw
[52:11] you away from the presence of god i'm
[52:14] quite sure the holy spirit would never
[52:16] draw you to do that all right
[52:19] so brother branham is answering the
[52:21] question about the the medium and the
[52:24] woman who speaks to to to spirits and
[52:26] brother branham is proving that he says
[52:28] that what that woman done she broke into
[52:31] that realm she is speaking to those
[52:33] demon-possessed men who were beginning
[52:35] the spirits of those fallen angels that
[52:37] repented not back yonder in the
[52:38] beginning and allow their beings to be
[52:40] possessed of them and they're waiting
[52:42] for judgment see over here are
[52:44] influenced and born again by the spirit
[52:46] of god today that these these mediums
[52:49] these seance people they cannot break
[52:52] into that realm and get a righteous man
[52:54] out of that realm he couldn't do it
[52:56] because righteous men see righteous men
[52:59] are not where they used to be in
[53:00] paradise they used to be down in the
[53:03] lower regions of the earth and a
[53:05] segmented place called paradise which
[53:06] god did away with after he after jesus
[53:09] resurrected them out and took them into
[53:11] the throne room of god amen amen
[53:15] and so you once they're in that land of
[53:17] the redeemed you're not going to get
[53:18] them back here in a seance if you're
[53:21] talking to someone dead i promise you
[53:23] you're not connecting to someone in
[53:25] glory amen that's impossible see
[53:29] and so brother branham talks about when
[53:32] jesus died he went and preached to the
[53:34] souls that were in prison he goes on in
[53:36] 57 as the eagles stir with her nest
[53:39] those prophets went so high now just
[53:41] listen to this language those profits
[53:43] went so high
[53:46] what does that mean
[53:47] they went so high all right let's think
[53:50] about this
[53:51] they went so high they could see things
[53:55] are far off to come
[53:57] he says god does his prophets they raise
[54:00] up the eagles of god has flew so high
[54:03] into the stratospheres
[54:05] of god
[54:07] all right
[54:08] that he says until they see
[54:10] they've seen that day coming and they've
[54:12] dropped back
[54:14] down
[54:15] and pinned it off on the bible
[54:18] and somehow
[54:19] somehow
[54:21] when you become into that realm
[54:23] you can feel that there's something
[54:25] coming something makes us hunger
[54:29] brother brown talks about the animal
[54:30] kingdom who don't have a soul
[54:32] they have no concept
[54:34] of desiring
[54:36] a place of peace and rest and comfort
[54:39] like we say oh for heaven oh for the
[54:41] millennium see an animal just is all
[54:43] stimuli he eats and he'll jump up and
[54:45] down for you and bark when you can train
[54:47] him to do different things but he has no
[54:49] concept that there's a land beyond the
[54:52] river that they call the sweet but we do
[54:54] see because you have a soul we long to
[54:57] be there
[54:58] we where something in us tells us this
[55:01] can't be how it all should be there's
[55:03] something broken and i need something
[55:05] repaired i need to go somewhere all
[55:08] right
[55:10] so he goes on in 1960 in the patmos
[55:12] vision
[55:15] now is this is this the one
[55:19] no okay carry let me let me just catch
[55:21] these before i start on my powerpoint
[55:24] so in the patmos vision
[55:26] he he starts talking about how that god
[55:29] you know he crushed death and hell and
[55:31] the grave and sickness and formalities
[55:34] and everything and overcome it all and
[55:35] rose on the third day and conquered all
[55:37] the conquered all the atmospheres now
[55:40] watch this because this word atmospheres
[55:42] you remember when
[55:45] john is baptizing
[55:47] and
[55:48] the the bible says
[55:51] the spirit of god descended like a in
[55:52] the bodily presence of a dove and a
[55:55] voice spoke from heaven
[55:57] and trinitarians say see speaking from
[56:00] heaven and they always just think of
[56:01] heaven
[56:03] and brother branham says well actually
[56:05] what it says in the original language is
[56:07] god spoke from the atmospheres
[56:10] and brother branham would say there's
[56:11] atmospheres between you and me
[56:14] so you don't always just think of
[56:16] somewhere in alpha centauri or the misty
[56:17] blue or way over the rainbow
[56:20] okay the bible says he be not far from
[56:22] us all the bible says we're coming to a
[56:25] time this was in the era of the holy
[56:27] ghost where we are now when there won't
[56:28] be anyone saying somebody cross the sea
[56:31] and go bring god back to us or somebody
[56:33] go up to heaven and go bring him down to
[56:35] us because the age of the holy ghost
[56:37] brings the kingdom of god within you
[56:40] and brother branham says that
[56:42] with the sacrifice of the lord jesus
[56:44] heaven and earth embraced and kissed
[56:47] see he makes another statement here he
[56:50] says he
[56:51] he um
[56:52] he crushed the grave in sickness and
[56:54] formalities and overcome it all and rose
[56:57] on third day and conquered all the
[56:58] atmospheres above now listen
[57:00] and cut the mist
[57:02] between god and man and connected heaven
[57:05] and earth together
[57:09] he says in
[57:11] is anything too hard for god
[57:14] he says abraham knew inside
[57:17] you know that
[57:18] that
[57:19] he said you know when he when he met
[57:20] those men
[57:22] and
[57:23] lot said my lords but abraham said my
[57:26] lord
[57:27] and they both saw the same thing
[57:30] and they were all just human abraham
[57:31] wasn't any more or less a human than lot
[57:33] was
[57:34] why did lot
[57:36] misinterpret and see three
[57:38] but abraham caught it correctly and only
[57:41] saw one
[57:42] and he said my lord he saw three men but
[57:44] only one of them was the one he was
[57:46] ready to worship see and brother branham
[57:49] said abraham knew
[57:51] there was something real the spirit
[57:53] declared it why now here it is you ready
[57:55] you want this you want this secret intel
[57:58] you want this insider trading info of
[57:59] how to discern
[58:01] he said he kept himself in a spiritual
[58:04] atmosphere all the time
[58:07] that he could recognize right from wrong
[58:10] all the time
[58:11] amen
[58:14] amen
[58:15] he says that's the way the christian
[58:18] ought to do today
[58:19] is keep yourself prayed up
[58:22] under a spiritual atmosphere see
[58:26] always never seeing the bad side look to
[58:29] the good side your children of god
[58:31] expect his blessings
[58:35] oh don't look to the bad side don't pay
[58:37] attention to doom and gloom don't worry
[58:39] about symptoms look to a promise stay in
[58:42] the atmospheres of god expect good
[58:44] things
[58:46] see
[58:47] he said in 1960 last year in 1960 from
[58:51] the message it is i
[58:54] oh there it is if you knew who was
[58:56] talking to you see
[58:58] and and jesus now he's got jesus at the
[59:00] at the woman at the well the scripture
[59:03] that brother branham went to
[59:06] more than any other scripture in
[59:09] discernment lines
[59:12] more than any probably the second one
[59:14] would probably be hebrews 13 8 but he
[59:16] goes to the woman at the well in
[59:18] discernment lines more than makes that
[59:20] reference in connection he says now i'm
[59:21] just a man here's a woman she's standing
[59:23] before me he says now it's just a scene
[59:25] of saint john
[59:26] all right and he goes here and so so he
[59:29] she's she's in a conversation and and
[59:32] she says we know here's what i know by
[59:34] the reading i've been taught i was in
[59:36] sunday school we know when messiah
[59:38] cometh i i have that much education i'm
[59:40] still a i'm still a harlot
[59:43] but i do have an education of the word
[59:46] i it had not done anything for my life
[59:48] see because it was just in her head but
[59:50] but there was a seed down inside there
[59:53] all she needed to do was come in contact
[59:55] with the living word
[59:57] amen
[59:58] see so so she says here but jesus said
[1:00:02] if you knew she says we know the messiah
[1:00:04] is coming he says if you knew who you
[1:00:06] were talking to
[1:00:07] she said you know you're asking me for a
[1:00:09] drink he said but if you knew who you
[1:00:10] was talking to you'd ask me for one see
[1:00:12] and i'd give you water that you never
[1:00:14] thirst again he says i'm sure if every
[1:00:17] sinner in here feeling the presence
[1:00:19] and the atmosphere now this is an
[1:00:22] amazing statement and it's very common
[1:00:24] to you
[1:00:26] ex feeling the presence and the
[1:00:28] atmosphere of setting together tonight
[1:00:30] in heavenly places in christ jesus and
[1:00:33] that little feeling that's telling you
[1:00:35] if you knew who you were talking to
[1:00:38] if you really caught a vision when you
[1:00:41] say i'm sitting together
[1:00:44] in heavenly places that's a little bit
[1:00:46] of a of of of of a gordian not
[1:00:50] if from your human mind because you're
[1:00:52] not in heaven
[1:00:54] i'm here on the earth i wish i was in
[1:00:55] heaven and i know god is in heaven
[1:00:58] somewhere
[1:01:00] and i'm kind of down here
[1:01:03] but actually the bible is saying
[1:01:05] through the work of the holy spirit you
[1:01:09] here in this channel there's some
[1:01:12] part of you
[1:01:13] in heavenly places
[1:01:16] in the presence of god
[1:01:18] it doesn't matter if the whole world's
[1:01:20] blowing up around you in your little
[1:01:22] channel there's a more
[1:01:24] real you that has access to say
[1:01:27] father and you don't need a bull horn
[1:01:29] and you don't need a walkie-talkie and
[1:01:31] you don't even have to shout no one even
[1:01:33] needs to hear it you can just back up in
[1:01:36] a time of trouble and say lord and the
[1:01:38] lord is immediately don't have to wait
[1:01:40] for him to get there there's no there's
[1:01:42] no uh internet lag here immediately yes
[1:01:45] my son
[1:01:46] because you're that's where you live i
[1:01:49] live in his presence see
[1:01:52] and so now
[1:01:54] he comes to the true easter seal all
[1:01:56] right uh brother josh we're going to go
[1:01:58] with advancing slides now the coming of
[1:02:00] the lord part 4. i want to put this up
[1:02:02] because it's lengthy and i want to read
[1:02:03] it all you'll be advancing my slide sir
[1:02:06] all right let's go
[1:02:07] and so this is the living temple of
[1:02:09] god's presence 1961. let's go
[1:02:13] the true easter seal now
[1:02:15] we are sitting together in heavenly
[1:02:17] places in christ jesus now we realize
[1:02:20] that jesus the body of jesus was caught
[1:02:23] up from the resurrection now we know
[1:02:26] that the bible speaks of three heavens
[1:02:27] we know it first heaven second heaven
[1:02:29] third heaven i believe it was paul was
[1:02:30] called away in the third heaven and seen
[1:02:32] things that wasn't expedient for him to
[1:02:35] speak of them next
[1:02:37] now the first heaven is called in the
[1:02:40] scripture
[1:02:41] like the clouds in other words down
[1:02:43] below here on the earthly seal now when
[1:02:45] that atmosphere from up and above the
[1:02:47] clouds becomes down into the church
[1:02:50] that's a heavenly place
[1:02:52] then the second heavens is considered
[1:02:54] the solar system and the third heavens
[1:02:56] goes beyond that now watch
[1:02:58] now we just happen to think just watch
[1:03:00] this a minute now einstein proved by
[1:03:03] scientific
[1:03:05] that if two objects was coming to each
[1:03:07] other like two cars coming down across
[1:03:10] the road and if they were coming fast
[1:03:12] enough now they'd really have to be
[1:03:14] going fast like a you know like a
[1:03:17] billion miles per second
[1:03:19] but they could pass right through one
[1:03:21] another and never disturb a thing
[1:03:26] now i'm expanding your mind
[1:03:28] i'm expanding what you think of as
[1:03:30] reality all right next
[1:03:33] the speed would do it pass them right
[1:03:36] through one another without disturbing
[1:03:38] anything
[1:03:39] now if you'll notice
[1:03:41] i was standing here not long ago at
[1:03:43] mount
[1:03:44] however you pronounce that in california
[1:03:47] and i was noticing there that telescope
[1:03:50] that can see a hundred and twenty
[1:03:52] million light uh light space now think
[1:03:55] 120 million years of light space how
[1:03:58] many miles that would be to be broke
[1:04:00] down see
[1:04:03] next
[1:04:04] but yet heaven
[1:04:06] is so many billions and billions and
[1:04:09] billions of light years beyond that till
[1:04:11] it's not even thought of how would we
[1:04:14] get there it's the travel it will be
[1:04:17] like the mind it's so fast it'll be
[1:04:20] faster if you can think of heaven that's
[1:04:23] how quick you'd be there
[1:04:27] amen that's how quick
[1:04:29] you'd be there all right
[1:04:32] but after he was resurrected
[1:04:38] back up a screen
[1:04:42] okay carry on
[1:04:44] all right
[1:04:45] jesus after he was resurrected
[1:04:48] came oh yeah right through
[1:04:51] walls
[1:04:52] right through the doors and stood and
[1:04:56] eat boiled fish and honeycomb hallelujah
[1:04:58] speed
[1:04:59] no sooner than life has gone out of this
[1:05:02] body we're in the presence of god yonder
[1:05:04] we only know as feet and inches and
[1:05:06] yards and miles and so forth we're in
[1:05:08] this earthbound system but when we leave
[1:05:10] here brother oh my
[1:05:12] what a time
[1:05:13] [Music]
[1:05:16] all right josh take that down
[1:05:19] so now when we start thinking about this
[1:05:21] now i'm coming to
[1:05:23] because i've got to come to it otherwise
[1:05:26] i i one of the things as i was studying
[1:05:28] this today
[1:05:29] uh that i thought you know i've got to
[1:05:31] make this i got to connect a dot
[1:05:34] otherwise this is just so what preaching
[1:05:36] and i don't ever want to be guilty of
[1:05:37] that i've seen preachers do that where
[1:05:39] they speak of all these
[1:05:41] and you're
[1:05:42] everybody's like oh
[1:05:44] and you leave there and nobody even
[1:05:45] knows what was said or what's the value
[1:05:47] of it and i just call it so what
[1:05:48] preaching you know what value does it
[1:05:51] really have so today i'm trying to
[1:05:53] connect you all to something all right
[1:05:54] so just stay with me
[1:05:56] so now
[1:05:58] in science today and a lot in science
[1:06:01] fiction but yet they don't realize that
[1:06:03] it's not as fiction as they think it is
[1:06:06] but but actually there's a whole
[1:06:09] uh a whole discussion of what they term
[1:06:13] in these days as parallel worlds in
[1:06:15] parallel universe
[1:06:18] and they see it as stacked realities now
[1:06:21] they don't what they don't know
[1:06:23] is they're actually very close to the
[1:06:26] truth
[1:06:27] amen you see that just just like for
[1:06:30] instance just like for instance when you
[1:06:32] leave here you don't die you just go to
[1:06:34] another world
[1:06:36] and you're still alive
[1:06:39] and now einstein is proving that if
[1:06:41] there's enough speed that that
[1:06:45] matter can pass through matter solid
[1:06:47] objects and not disturb the molecules at
[1:06:49] all we travel like a thought now if you
[1:06:52] ever think about traveling like a
[1:06:53] thought it's really
[1:06:54] then in heaven when you travel like a
[1:06:56] thought then distance is relative
[1:06:59] because it wouldn't matter it's still
[1:07:00] just a thought
[1:07:02] so if i want to go from here to that
[1:07:04] door it would take me 10 or 12 seconds
[1:07:07] to get back there
[1:07:09] because it's only 40 feet but if i
[1:07:12] wanted to go 40 miles that's going to
[1:07:14] take me a whole lot longer
[1:07:16] you see
[1:07:17] and but in heaven whether something is
[1:07:20] 40 feet or 4 gazillion miles if that's a
[1:07:23] term
[1:07:24] i think it and i'm there
[1:07:27] so there's a whole difference in the
[1:07:29] time space continuum listen friends god
[1:07:32] is amazing
[1:07:34] amazing and a lot of times we we can get
[1:07:37] so
[1:07:39] narrowly focused down into here to our
[1:07:41] lives that we just walk around in a
[1:07:43] little shoebox like we're like animals
[1:07:45] just reacting to stimuli
[1:07:48] and you know and you lose sight of the
[1:07:49] fact that wait a minute i i i'm not i
[1:07:52] i'm an eternal creature there's way more
[1:07:56] waiting on me this is just a training
[1:07:58] ground this life even about this life
[1:08:00] it's all about the next one that's a
[1:08:02] that's an amazing freeing liberating
[1:08:05] mindset to have
[1:08:06] because then no matter what the devil
[1:08:08] does that the lord allows you can just
[1:08:11] look the devil in the face and say it
[1:08:12] don't matter and you don't matter
[1:08:16] i come from god i'm going back to god
[1:08:19] and there's nothing you can do about it
[1:08:21] satan even i can't do anything about it
[1:08:23] see
[1:08:24] and so so we realized that the whole
[1:08:27] thing of realms above and realms below
[1:08:31] and we're actually in the middle because
[1:08:33] if you think about it now and i'm not
[1:08:35] here to define everything please don't
[1:08:37] think that everything i'm teaching is
[1:08:39] defined uh doctrinal positions i'm just
[1:08:43] i'm just trying to free your mind a
[1:08:45] little bit because i'm coming to
[1:08:46] something all right
[1:08:48] so
[1:08:49] so you know when brother branham let me
[1:08:51] give you some things to think about
[1:08:52] you remember brother branham in the sage
[1:08:55] field and he saw jesus
[1:08:58] and he says jesus was just a little bit
[1:09:00] a little bit up in the air
[1:09:02] and he said now bro the question was
[1:09:05] was he real or am i having a dream or is
[1:09:06] it but brother branham said i noticed
[1:09:08] that when the wind blew the sage it blew
[1:09:11] his garment also
[1:09:13] and he said i i actually turned around
[1:09:15] trying to get his attention kept going
[1:09:16] trying to clear my throat
[1:09:18] ah
[1:09:21] you know and
[1:09:22] and finally he just says
[1:09:25] jesus and he turns and looks and he says
[1:09:28] that's the last thing i remember till
[1:09:29] the next morning i woke up and my
[1:09:31] pajamas were wet with the dew he says
[1:09:34] there's no way to paint those eyes
[1:09:36] he said where when you look at his eyes
[1:09:39] it's like you want to burst into tears
[1:09:42] he said but yet it also had the look
[1:09:44] that if he would speak the world would
[1:09:46] end amen
[1:09:48] and so this is our god this is who we
[1:09:51] are in us in in marriage with
[1:09:54] this is the being that your life here is
[1:09:56] not just a normal life and what we read
[1:09:59] in chapter 11 is not just a metaphor
[1:10:02] there's a bride coming to something
[1:10:05] amen amen i'm here to tell you friends
[1:10:08] our future's bright
[1:10:10] our future is bright
[1:10:13] so you know jesus
[1:10:15] when he left mount carmel ascended up
[1:10:18] into a clan the bible says a cloud
[1:10:20] received him
[1:10:22] see the old testament saints ascended up
[1:10:26] out of paradise and walked around in the
[1:10:28] channel
[1:10:31] walked around in the channel after
[1:10:33] coming out of paradise and then it was
[1:10:35] just a little whistle stop because they
[1:10:37] already had bodies the channel couldn't
[1:10:39] hold
[1:10:40] and they just said and abraham says lord
[1:10:43] do you care if we make a little whistle
[1:10:44] stop i'd like to see the old city been
[1:10:47] been how many hundred years since
[1:10:48] abraham had walked the walked in the
[1:10:50] channel in the middle
[1:10:53] and sure and so they're they're they're
[1:10:55] going down streets and going down
[1:10:57] looking at this and look at that and
[1:10:58] brother branham just dramatizes it i'm
[1:11:00] glad he was a prophet otherwise we'd
[1:11:02] think he was nuts
[1:11:03] but but but when when a prophet
[1:11:06] sometimes when a prophet sees things
[1:11:08] friends you just say my what kind of
[1:11:10] eyes is he looking through
[1:11:12] i know this much john saw a pillar of
[1:11:15] fire that nobody else saw
[1:11:17] i know that paul saw a light no one else
[1:11:19] saw you see and so so we find that that
[1:11:23] abraham says oh sarah wait duck back
[1:11:26] said i think we've been recognized we
[1:11:28] better go and
[1:11:31] they were gone
[1:11:36] brother branham
[1:11:38] went from this dimension
[1:11:41] that you
[1:11:42] live in right now
[1:11:44] and he walked into the sixth dimension
[1:11:48] through a dimensional doorway that had
[1:11:51] moments before ben his bedroom wall
[1:11:54] and suddenly it's a portal
[1:11:57] and he says it it was just a little rise
[1:11:59] it wasn't a great big mountain it's just
[1:12:02] a just a grassy and he said it just rose
[1:12:04] a little bit
[1:12:06] and he literally walked from here and
[1:12:08] just up a little grassy rise and coming
[1:12:12] over he said was all of these redeemed
[1:12:14] and hugging him and screaming our
[1:12:15] precious brother he didn't walk to the
[1:12:18] to alpha centauri
[1:12:21] he didn't leave and go
[1:12:22] you know across the sea or
[1:12:24] he he got up out of his bed and walked
[1:12:27] the distance of his room and stepped
[1:12:28] through a door and was there and and
[1:12:31] turned around and looked back and saw
[1:12:33] his body
[1:12:35] am i expanding your mind today
[1:12:37] see
[1:12:39] so so we find then that brother branham
[1:12:42] speaking of hell and i i didn't get the
[1:12:44] references but i looked at them today to
[1:12:46] make sure i had it straight and brother
[1:12:48] branham there's numbers of references
[1:12:49] where brother branham makes this
[1:12:51] reference
[1:12:52] about you know people who think there's
[1:12:55] no
[1:12:56] hell that hell's not real and brother
[1:12:58] branham said it's a churning right under
[1:13:00] you right now
[1:13:03] see
[1:13:05] so so you mean down inside the earth is
[1:13:07] where hell is i'm i'm i'm here to tell
[1:13:09] you is all i can tell you i can tell you
[1:13:11] that that he that ascended into the
[1:13:14] cloud
[1:13:15] first descended into the lower parts of
[1:13:18] the earth
[1:13:19] and preached to souls in prison i'm
[1:13:20] quite sure it's dimensional
[1:13:23] i'm quite sure you couldn't dig a hole
[1:13:25] and go find
[1:13:26] them there you understand you'd hit lava
[1:13:29] before you'd ever find anybody and you
[1:13:31] wouldn't even get to lava i forget how
[1:13:32] many thousands of miles it's down
[1:13:34] and so so but but we do find that there
[1:13:37] is an up and there is a down but it's
[1:13:39] not way off in the milky way somewhere
[1:13:42] although the heavens and heavens of
[1:13:44] heavens
[1:13:45] expand throughout the universe and they
[1:13:47] can't even find the borders and they
[1:13:49] really believe it's even ever expanding
[1:13:51] right now
[1:13:52] see
[1:13:53] and so we find that there's there's a
[1:13:56] number of references in the scripture
[1:13:58] because jesus descended into the lower
[1:14:02] parts of the earth brother branham
[1:14:05] descended
[1:14:07] down you remember the way he described
[1:14:09] it i was falling
[1:14:12] and there was no foundation it was a
[1:14:15] weary misery because there was no
[1:14:18] foundation no firmness he could stand on
[1:14:21] and here come all the spooks around him
[1:14:23] because he was a newer rival see
[1:14:26] now he didn't go up he didn't stay here
[1:14:28] he said i started falling
[1:14:31] and i've heard other people have
[1:14:33] near-death experience described the same
[1:14:35] things
[1:14:36] and so
[1:14:37] we find that that the bible says
[1:14:40] pharaoh that pharaoh
[1:14:44] descended at his death
[1:14:47] they thought he was going into the into
[1:14:49] heaven but not according to the bible
[1:14:51] according to the bible he descended down
[1:14:54] into the pit
[1:14:57] and all along the pit are cells
[1:15:00] and there's millions upon millions of
[1:15:03] people in those cells and they watched
[1:15:05] pharaoh and they and the convicts
[1:15:08] shouted from their cells oh pharaoh
[1:15:12] you too
[1:15:13] now you've come down here to join us
[1:15:17] you were a heathen well
[1:15:19] guess what
[1:15:20] you were wrong about heaven and now
[1:15:24] pharaoh you're descending down into the
[1:15:27] pit
[1:15:29] the bible tells us in revelation 12 that
[1:15:31] satan
[1:15:32] fell from heaven that a star fell from
[1:15:34] heaven which was satan because he was
[1:15:36] given the keys to the bottomless pit
[1:15:39] see
[1:15:40] and so we realized that
[1:15:42] that that brother here's another here's
[1:15:44] another thing a prophet would say
[1:15:46] the lid
[1:15:48] is torn off hell
[1:15:50] and demon powers are streaming into the
[1:15:52] earth
[1:15:55] have i expanded your mind
[1:15:57] you you're fully expanded today you
[1:15:59] understand you're not just living in
[1:16:00] light time and matter behind in in
[1:16:03] realms you can't see i'm gonna tell you
[1:16:05] something friends and and
[1:16:07] when the enemy one of the things that
[1:16:08] became so real to me when the lord saved
[1:16:11] my life and i didn't know that i was
[1:16:14] perhaps hours or at most days from dying
[1:16:18] and when i realized that god and i and i
[1:16:21] said to somebody the enemy was moving
[1:16:24] and devils were conspiring to take me
[1:16:26] out but what i couldn't see in a realm i
[1:16:28] couldn't see angels were moving to
[1:16:30] interdict
[1:16:31] angels were moving every time a devil
[1:16:33] would move an angel would cut him off
[1:16:34] and i can go back in my memory and
[1:16:36] remember it happening i go that's why
[1:16:38] wow that's why that happened that was
[1:16:41] the enemy trying to kill me but god saw
[1:16:42] me standing here saw us together
[1:16:45] hallelujah and there was no way god
[1:16:47] could let that happen
[1:16:49] it's like i said to you last wednesday
[1:16:51] there's no child of god left this earth
[1:16:54] unless their time was up or god for some
[1:16:57] sovereign reason allowed it in his own
[1:16:59] in his own choosing
[1:17:01] so we just say blessed that's why paul
[1:17:03] could say in all things i've learned no
[1:17:05] matter what condition i'm content
[1:17:07] because i'm in the hands of the lord
[1:17:11] see
[1:17:13] and so we find that the lid is torn off
[1:17:16] jacob
[1:17:17] saw angels
[1:17:19] he come to bethel
[1:17:21] and bethel was was completely uncommon
[1:17:25] there was nothing bethel was just common
[1:17:27] land
[1:17:28] but what made it what made that spot a
[1:17:31] holy spot was jacob laid laid his head
[1:17:34] on a pillow and when he when he woke up
[1:17:37] there was a ladder
[1:17:39] that was standing on the earth and
[1:17:40] connected to heaven and he saw angels
[1:17:43] going up and down that ladder coming
[1:17:44] from heaven to here from here to heaven
[1:17:46] from heaven to here from here to heaven
[1:17:47] and he stood there and watched them and
[1:17:48] then he said at the top of the ladder
[1:17:50] now he sees the son of man
[1:17:52] and the son of man is making a pledge to
[1:17:54] him and jacob is making a pledge back to
[1:17:56] him and i'm going to tell you something
[1:17:58] that ground jacob come out of it and
[1:18:00] said my goodness
[1:18:02] i didn't even realize
[1:18:04] that this is nothing less than the house
[1:18:06] of god and this is the gate of heaven
[1:18:10] see
[1:18:11] i mean god
[1:18:12] chose told moses very particularly i'm
[1:18:16] getting ahead of myself but he told
[1:18:18] moses at the burning bush now you're
[1:18:20] going to go and you're going to free the
[1:18:21] people and you're going to bring them
[1:18:22] back to this mountain
[1:18:25] and it's going to be there that i'm
[1:18:26] going to speak to him
[1:18:28] and that was even before the exodus and
[1:18:30] now now moses has a commission and when
[1:18:32] he brings them back then the mountain
[1:18:34] which was just a mountain like any other
[1:18:36] mountain but now
[1:18:38] god came down on the mountain and a
[1:18:41] mountain that anybody was welcome to
[1:18:43] traverse 24 hours prior
[1:18:46] anybody tries it now dies
[1:18:49] if even an innocent animal put a hoof on
[1:18:51] it had to be killed because now the
[1:18:54] mountain became consecrated even though
[1:18:56] it was just an ordinary mountain you're
[1:18:57] just an ordinary person it's not the man
[1:19:00] that comes predestinated but there's a
[1:19:02] seed inside you there's a gene and that
[1:19:05] means you have an extraordinary purpose
[1:19:08] you're an ordinary person with an
[1:19:11] extraordinary purpose of god
[1:19:13] and when god comes down to tabernacle
[1:19:16] and his bride then you you yourself
[1:19:19] become a living temple of the living god
[1:19:24] and that's when evil spirits are afraid
[1:19:26] of you
[1:19:27] that's when you have power with god
[1:19:31] because like abraham you keep yourself
[1:19:33] consecrated
[1:19:35] all the time
[1:19:39] i'm going to say more about that in a
[1:19:41] future sermon but i don't want to go too
[1:19:42] far today
[1:19:45] so they talk about now here's
[1:19:48] i'm unqualified to speak about this i'm
[1:19:50] not a scientist but i got an i got
[1:19:53] enough hints and clues from a prophet
[1:19:55] but i know a little bit about it
[1:19:57] that brother branham said when they look
[1:19:59] through those telescopes and they see
[1:20:00] all those millions of light years he
[1:20:02] said they're actually looking at a curve
[1:20:05] now we don't fully know what that means
[1:20:07] and
[1:20:08] we don't even know exactly what the
[1:20:09] application is but i do know
[1:20:12] brother brandon mentions einstein with
[1:20:14] some of the things he proved one of the
[1:20:15] things he proved
[1:20:17] so so
[1:20:18] so you you understand if you're looking
[1:20:21] through a curve then it means light is
[1:20:23] being bent
[1:20:24] it's a curve it's being bent and science
[1:20:26] knows the only thing that can bend
[1:20:28] light
[1:20:29] is a large body that has a gravitational
[1:20:33] pull and as light goes around it it'll
[1:20:35] bend it and and scientists in in the
[1:20:38] early 20th century knew einstein said
[1:20:40] that in his paper but they had to wait
[1:20:43] for a solar eclipse to prove it and they
[1:20:45] did 1915. i forget the sir something in
[1:20:48] england he he waited for the solar
[1:20:50] eclipse and he mapped where the stars
[1:20:53] were
[1:20:54] took a photo
[1:20:56] and then during the eclipse
[1:20:58] the thing about an eclipse is it
[1:20:59] illuminates all the stars
[1:21:01] and when he took the eclipse he took
[1:21:02] another photo of where the stars were
[1:21:04] and when he compared the stars had moved
[1:21:07] they were in a different spot so where
[1:21:09] they thought they were
[1:21:11] now they're thinking it's somewhere else
[1:21:14] now
[1:21:15] brother branham said
[1:21:16] we're not seeing it correctly
[1:21:19] they're looking through it's already
[1:21:21] bent
[1:21:22] and so it's it's looking through a curve
[1:21:25] and and
[1:21:26] and i was just catching up this morning
[1:21:28] on the science of it a little bit
[1:21:30] and and they were saying that
[1:21:33] the sun
[1:21:34] is is really the one thing big enough
[1:21:36] that's why they had to wait on
[1:21:38] an eclipse of the sun because it bent
[1:21:40] the light just a little bit but they
[1:21:42] said one of the things that bends light
[1:21:45] much more than the sun because it is
[1:21:47] fantastically larger
[1:21:49] by many times to the power of something
[1:21:52] is what they call a black hole and they
[1:21:54] don't know what it is
[1:21:56] said well we can we can how do you how
[1:21:58] do you know it's there because they can
[1:21:59] see that whatever's there has no light
[1:22:02] emitting from it it's a whole space
[1:22:04] that's much more massive that could
[1:22:06] swallow the thus our sun and not even
[1:22:09] burp
[1:22:12] and they don't know what a black hole is
[1:22:13] but no light can can come out of it see
[1:22:16] in order to see something light has to
[1:22:18] go and come back and that's how your
[1:22:20] your eyes work you're seeing you're
[1:22:22] seeing photons of light and it's
[1:22:24] reflecting your brain your brain
[1:22:25] calculates what you're seeing and that's
[1:22:26] how you have sight
[1:22:28] and so now brother branham is saying
[1:22:31] they're looking at a curve
[1:22:33] and now i and i just was listening to
[1:22:35] the scientist today he said really the
[1:22:37] only thing that can bend light
[1:22:38] significantly is a black hole
[1:22:41] and i'm just thinking goodness
[1:22:45] is a black hole
[1:22:46] the realm where heaven is that nobody
[1:22:48] can see
[1:22:50] say well brother jason you're really
[1:22:51] getting hooky now i i'm not trying to
[1:22:55] i'm just broadening your mind i'm just
[1:22:57] trying to expand you a little bit to say
[1:23:00] we got all this figured out
[1:23:02] and life is a lot larger than you come
[1:23:05] here thinking today
[1:23:08] say what's the value in this it's just a
[1:23:09] science lesson no it's not i'm trying to
[1:23:12] get you to understand that life is more
[1:23:15] than a job and an education and a career
[1:23:17] in a recreation and friends and social
[1:23:19] media
[1:23:20] your life is more than that you're an
[1:23:22] eternal creature having a natural
[1:23:24] experience you came from god you're
[1:23:27] going back to god and there's a world
[1:23:29] coming that's makes this one as nothing
[1:23:34] and so i challenge you today
[1:23:36] oh understand that you're you're here
[1:23:39] for a much grander purpose than just the
[1:23:42] functions of living
[1:23:44] there'll be a day when this life will
[1:23:46] just be a faded memory
[1:23:49] where you worry about so many things
[1:23:50] here don't you i do don't you we worry
[1:23:52] about so many things brother brown said
[1:23:54] well these days you'll get on the other
[1:23:55] side you'll sit down under a tree and
[1:23:57] you'll just laugh at that
[1:23:59] you'll just laugh
[1:24:00] i was so worried about that it didn't
[1:24:03] even mean that
[1:24:07] so now
[1:24:09] so now we're i mean we already know
[1:24:12] what science can't prove or disprove but
[1:24:15] the bible says it
[1:24:17] we're in the space-time continuum
[1:24:20] a year is a year a day is a day
[1:24:24] but in the bible
[1:24:25] a day in that realm of heaven
[1:24:28] is a thousand earth years
[1:24:31] and brother branham goes back to
[1:24:32] einstein again and says einstein proved
[1:24:34] that if you could leave and travel the
[1:24:35] speed of light you might be gone
[1:24:36] hundreds of years and when you come back
[1:24:38] you've only been gone a few years
[1:24:41] and everybody else aged and got all
[1:24:42] around you and you come back out and
[1:24:44] you're still young
[1:24:45] and einstein proved that and he did
[1:24:47] prove that that's that's science knows
[1:24:49] he did prove that see
[1:24:51] and and so so we find that
[1:24:54] we are sitting together
[1:24:57] in heavenly places okay you tell me you
[1:25:00] tell me i'm gonna i'm i'm coming to a
[1:25:03] climax here because i can't finish today
[1:25:06] but i want to hit a climax
[1:25:10] if this all just sounds
[1:25:12] loopy
[1:25:13] okay well then then you tell me
[1:25:16] where did brother branham go
[1:25:18] when he's standing on a platform
[1:25:21] and he's here in front of an audience
[1:25:23] and he's saying if the audience can
[1:25:25] still hear my voice and the audience is
[1:25:26] sitting out there look at him yeah of
[1:25:27] course we can hear your voice and he
[1:25:29] says and he goes to the woman he says
[1:25:31] now i see you
[1:25:33] you're in a doctor's office he said he's
[1:25:35] a little fat man with big old thick coke
[1:25:37] bottle glasses yes that's right you can
[1:25:39] hear her yes that's right and he says he
[1:25:42] says you've got to
[1:25:43] uh
[1:25:44] do do do do and she says do edema he
[1:25:47] goes yeah he said i heard him say that
[1:25:50] yeah that's what he said
[1:25:51] now where'd he go
[1:25:53] first of all that's already happened in
[1:25:55] the past
[1:25:57] so where does a prophet go
[1:25:59] what is your past
[1:26:03] is the past is space time continuum just
[1:26:05] what we thought it is or is it something
[1:26:07] more than that
[1:26:08] here's a prophet who can stand here
[1:26:10] present and walk into the future
[1:26:14] and look back and go now when you get to
[1:26:16] hear this will be happening
[1:26:18] and you know what happens then he comes
[1:26:20] back and now he's back here and then you
[1:26:22] because you're stuck in the channel you
[1:26:23] go walking and by the time you get to
[1:26:25] here there it is exactly just what he
[1:26:27] said here it is
[1:26:29] so what's the future
[1:26:31] so then what's the timeline what's life
[1:26:33] anyway
[1:26:34] all right i'm just broadening your mind
[1:26:36] because i'm coming back to this
[1:26:38] statement again see
[1:26:40] what does it mean to sit together
[1:26:43] in heavenly places
[1:26:45] in christ jesus
[1:26:48] now watch
[1:26:51] i'm gonna just take a few more minutes
[1:26:53] so brother branham says
[1:26:56] in the seventh seal
[1:26:59] he says now i'm sure
[1:27:01] he says something's been going on all
[1:27:03] week
[1:27:05] and what it was was those angels moving
[1:27:07] in and out and a setting of prophecy and
[1:27:09] history was taking place and all it was
[1:27:12] was 500 people on a little little bitty
[1:27:15] church on penn street in indiana and
[1:27:18] while that's happening the whole world
[1:27:19] is going about their business and
[1:27:21] politics and governments and the kremlin
[1:27:22] and the vatican and the white and the
[1:27:24] white house and schools and universities
[1:27:26] and people and vacations everything
[1:27:27] everything's going on and here's god on
[1:27:29] a little bitty building
[1:27:31] and seven angels are visiting a prophet
[1:27:34] to give the greatest unlocking of
[1:27:36] mystery the world has ever known
[1:27:40] and he says now i've i've been i'm
[1:27:42] wondering if anyone would catch it he
[1:27:44] said no you didn't catch it he said but
[1:27:46] he said now he go he's going to give a
[1:27:47] little clue
[1:27:48] he says i'm sure you noticed
[1:27:52] you've noticed the things that's been
[1:27:53] happening this week i'm sure
[1:27:55] you noticed the little collins boy
[1:27:57] laying there now i know this collins boy
[1:28:00] is michael right mom it was michael
[1:28:02] collins
[1:28:03] and he says laying there dying the other
[1:28:05] night
[1:28:06] and they told him he can't go to school
[1:28:08] he's going to lay in a bed he could
[1:28:09] expire any time and within i think a day
[1:28:12] or two no the next day he went to school
[1:28:15] and it was so alarmed the community the
[1:28:16] doctors rushed in this child is going to
[1:28:18] be dead and they examined him we can't
[1:28:19] find a trace of it
[1:28:21] it didn't have to go through divine
[1:28:23] healing that takes sometimes days and
[1:28:25] months and even years it just one minute
[1:28:27] he's dying can't move the next minute
[1:28:28] he's in school and fine
[1:28:31] he says i guess you noticed the little
[1:28:33] leukemia girl the other night
[1:28:35] and all of these things that were
[1:28:37] happening
[1:28:38] by the power
[1:28:40] of the spoken word now watch
[1:28:43] and brother branham says here's what he
[1:28:45] says it is you want to know what it is
[1:28:48] the kingdom
[1:28:49] of god is coming
[1:28:53] and it's now watch
[1:28:54] not its way off in the misty blue
[1:28:56] someday it's going to get here no
[1:28:58] and it's becoming more
[1:29:00] from the negative to the positive as it
[1:29:03] has been
[1:29:06] what was happening there in that little
[1:29:08] church
[1:29:09] with five or six hundred people in 1963
[1:29:13] an insignificant group
[1:29:16] thought to be cults the brother
[1:29:18] branham's ministry has already been
[1:29:19] rejected by the world he went from from
[1:29:22] meetings where they had a hundred
[1:29:23] thousand to fifty thousand to twenty
[1:29:25] thousand to five thousand to five
[1:29:26] hundred
[1:29:28] and this one is the greatest meetings
[1:29:30] he's ever held
[1:29:33] went into cities where
[1:29:35] every single human being in the hospital
[1:29:37] left healed
[1:29:39] held meetings where he stood in a pulpit
[1:29:40] for eight nights and everybody that came
[1:29:42] to the platform was healed miraculously
[1:29:45] and now here he is saying that's nothing
[1:29:47] compared to this
[1:29:50] what was the what was chapter 10 all
[1:29:53] about what was the opening of those
[1:29:54] seals about
[1:29:57] what was happening now that now a
[1:29:59] kingdom of god
[1:30:01] is coming it's becoming more from the
[1:30:03] negative to the positive as it has been
[1:30:06] he says now that ought to choke people
[1:30:08] it went from justification
[1:30:09] sanctification baptism the holy ghost
[1:30:10] and then here see
[1:30:12] we're just drawing
[1:30:15] closer to god
[1:30:17] all the time
[1:30:19] see and so heavens
[1:30:22] have come down
[1:30:23] you get that
[1:30:25] heavens have come down what happened
[1:30:27] in chapter 10 of revelation heavens come
[1:30:30] down
[1:30:31] brother branham back in the in the
[1:30:33] revelation of jesus christ series when
[1:30:35] he's referring to the silence in heaven
[1:30:37] he said god emptied heaven
[1:30:40] now i don't fully know what that means i
[1:30:42] don't fully know what that means there's
[1:30:43] some people who preach different things
[1:30:44] that you know all the believers are
[1:30:45] already here in another dimension and i
[1:30:47] don't know i don't know about all that
[1:30:49] it's uh we'll figure it out when it
[1:30:51] happens we'll know
[1:30:53] you understand brother brown says once
[1:30:54] it starts see and i'm looking for it to
[1:30:56] start
[1:30:57] hallelujah oh i'm telling you something
[1:30:59] friends we're going to wake up one of
[1:31:00] these mornings and we're going to start
[1:31:02] to hear a little report of this and
[1:31:03] someone's been seen they were dead for
[1:31:05] years and someone saw and another
[1:31:07] report's going to come in yes it's
[1:31:08] happening here and over here and over
[1:31:09] here i'm here to tell you one of these
[1:31:11] days we're going to walk right through
[1:31:12] those doors
[1:31:14] and say we're done we're done we're
[1:31:15] finished it's time to go hallelujah
[1:31:19] that is a reality of our lives the
[1:31:21] kingdom is not coming it's already
[1:31:23] started with the opening of the word god
[1:31:26] has come down to tabernacle the living
[1:31:28] god in living people
[1:31:32] see we meet him in the atmosphere
[1:31:35] he doesn't step foot on the earth we
[1:31:37] meet him in the atmosphere after a month
[1:31:39] or so of getting to know because you're
[1:31:41] going to need a month or so people say
[1:31:44] 30 to 40 days brother didn't say it that
[1:31:45] way he caught it a month or so because
[1:31:47] that was 40 days that they that abraham
[1:31:49] and sarah and then wandered around
[1:31:52] after the resurrection
[1:31:54] and so brother brown said after a month
[1:31:55] or so why are we going to need that
[1:31:57] because
[1:31:58] because when brother branham went beyond
[1:32:00] the curtain of time he didn't see paul
[1:32:03] he didn't see luther he didn't see all
[1:32:05] of those he saw his people so we find
[1:32:08] that under the throne there's all kinds
[1:32:10] of places where god has people tucked
[1:32:12] away
[1:32:13] but on that glorious morning they're all
[1:32:16] coming back and i'm here to tell you
[1:32:18] it's going to take a month or so because
[1:32:19] we're going to wonder i wonder if
[1:32:20] so-and-so made it i wonder if so-and-so
[1:32:22] made it and we're going to be oh what an
[1:32:24] hour friends what a time that's going to
[1:32:26] be
[1:32:28] and we're going to need that time
[1:32:29] because when we see him in the
[1:32:31] atmospheres oh we need to have all of
[1:32:33] our questions answered and all of our
[1:32:35] focus is on him
[1:32:37] say brother jason this is kooky crazy
[1:32:39] preaching you people are nuts well
[1:32:42] brother branham said i'm happy this way
[1:32:44] if this ain't that then i'll take this
[1:32:46] till that comes uh uh call me a nut but
[1:32:48] i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm threaded to the
[1:32:51] right boat
[1:32:52] that's for sure i'll be a nut for jesus
[1:32:55] who's not were you going to be a nut for
[1:32:57] science
[1:32:58] who doesn't understand any of this stuff
[1:33:00] and disbelieves all of it but i'm here
[1:33:02] to tell you we had a prophet that came
[1:33:03] and proved it
[1:33:07] heaven he said what's the cause of the
[1:33:10] of the evil in the world would you
[1:33:12] believe
[1:33:14] that it's god doing it
[1:33:18] yeah
[1:33:19] indirectly there's no evil in god but
[1:33:22] what's happening is it's the presence of
[1:33:25] the morning star pressing the darkness
[1:33:27] see that's what the science knows it's
[1:33:29] the darkest right before the sun comes
[1:33:31] up because as the sun is coming those
[1:33:33] photons in light are congealing the
[1:33:35] darkness
[1:33:37] and that's why the world is in such a
[1:33:39] darkened state because a mighty angel
[1:33:41] descended in revelation 10 with an open
[1:33:44] book and a prophet was standing there to
[1:33:46] take it and and and now a bride is
[1:33:48] feeding on it and she's coming to be the
[1:33:50] living tabernacle of the living god's
[1:33:52] presence
[1:33:54] amen and what's doing it the presence of
[1:33:56] the morning star to announce christ to
[1:33:59] the world brother branham said it's the
[1:34:01] morning star that's why it's so dark
[1:34:03] it's it's the light pressing on the
[1:34:05] darkness he said in former latter reign
[1:34:07] 1960 and shalom 64 the hour is upon us
[1:34:11] darkness gross darkness gross darkness
[1:34:13] on people that's what it is what does it
[1:34:16] all
[1:34:16] mean amen what does it all mean
[1:34:20] where are we standing
[1:34:22] what hour are we in how close are we to
[1:34:25] the coming he says what does it all mean
[1:34:28] god has began to separate the light from
[1:34:31] the darkness sea pressing it behind like
[1:34:34] he did in the beginning to show the dawn
[1:34:35] of the new day the church ages are
[1:34:38] fading out this is 1964. god is pressing
[1:34:41] the darkness into a place it has to do
[1:34:43] it to fade out the church organizations
[1:34:46] fade out the world the world is covering
[1:34:49] the thing over and worldlyism has took
[1:34:52] the whole thing then isn't god right by
[1:34:55] worldly things and worldly dressing and
[1:34:58] worldly acting and worldly living listen
[1:35:01] listen use that use that my precious
[1:35:04] young sisters when when you feel like
[1:35:06] dressing in the vulgar fashions of the
[1:35:09] world and exposing your body and having
[1:35:12] lustful men lust after you just remember
[1:35:14] you're feeding the darkness
[1:35:17] it's the darkness causing you to do that
[1:35:19] come to the light today
[1:35:22] see
[1:35:23] so he says worldisms took the whole
[1:35:25] thing it's the world
[1:35:27] you're not of the world little children
[1:35:29] you are of heaven this is not
[1:35:32] your
[1:35:34] home
[1:35:36] thank god
[1:35:38] thank god thank god bethel tabernacle
[1:35:41] this is not my home
[1:35:44] now i say to the church

[1:36:11] when we see darkness settling darkness
[1:36:14] just before day we know that the morning
[1:36:16] star is hanging yawned her yonder to
[1:36:19] introduce the coming sun that's when the
[1:36:21] morning star shines between sea it's
[1:36:24] always dark as just a few minutes before
[1:36:26] day the blackout comes the moon fails to
[1:36:28] shine the darkest day the darkest before
[1:36:31] day
[1:36:32] because the light is pressing the
[1:36:34] darkness
[1:36:36] but the morning star comes out and says
[1:36:38] good morning
[1:36:40] hallelujah
[1:36:41] that's him doing it
[1:36:45] that's him doing it his word the morning
[1:36:48] star his word being identified shalom
[1:36:52] the great day is fixing to break and
[1:36:54] when morning breaks eternal bright and
[1:36:56] fair when his chosen one shall gather to
[1:36:59] their home beyond the sky when the roll
[1:37:01] is caught up yonder i'll be there
[1:37:03] our names are on his book we'll be there
[1:37:06] we'll be there shalom good morning peace
[1:37:09] be unto you your name is on the lamb's
[1:37:11] book of life
