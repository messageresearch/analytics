========================================

and that's because um I was born in Mexico City a long time ago and eventually I was the first of 10 children and so um my um parents were Baptist missionaries and my four brothers are Baptist preachers so my youngest brother built a nice Church in Flagstaff last two years and so the eight remaining siblings all showed up for the dedication so I was out there but uh I was asked if I spoke Spanish yes I'm bilingual I was raised in Mexico um and so we're glad that we can be here with you and we could speak all night and maybe not touch on the um subject that is bothering you or the that the question that you might have so um if you have any questions we thinking about them and we will do our best to uh answer the question to where it would be something you could understand we're not going to preach we'll do that on Sunday and I know that you have a good preacher here so I'm struggling to see what I can say that hasn't been said or that might make sense but just like with brother Matt and his dad well of course our good friend Brad here JD um everybody's got their own angle at the word my purpose in the ministry is to like brother Bram says make Christ real to the people we can all go and see what brother Bram said about whatever subject and we've spent our life translating into Spanish and producing other books to help people you know but um my first question would be who all here is actually married besides Brad what yeah JD your wife's not here anybody else married oh yeah man are you kind of getting close getting close are you committed yeah oh real close uh committ okay well so we're basically dealing with people that are headed towards marriage and um the only thing I can tell you is wait until the right person comes along even if you're 30 it doesn't matter because there's worse things in going through life single yeah believe me you don't have to look very far you believe that to prove the point but um so what what things are on your mind things that um you need help with or we're not talking Doctrine we're talking just simply your everyday stuff and stuff you might not understand in the message even though you've been here for several years um and we'll start with Brad I'm sure he's got at least one question asking questions yeah Sarah does he have a question yes please do I heard I think I don't remember which brother's ttim Brandon was a bit of a prankster he had a great sense of humor yes and then when people played tricks on him he was real cool about it too like he was going down the street one day in a station wagon and so one of his you know young men are riding along with him and so here comes this pretty girl you know walking down the street so when they get close this guy reaches over and honks the horn and he Ducks down the only one they can see is from yeah he uh he was uh he had a real sense of humor Y what else how did you meet your wife I met my wife because I okay my mother was born and raised in Tucson Arizona and so when I got up to the 10th grade they sent me from Mexico to live with my grandfather in Arizona and so I'm in this school of 25 200 kids big school and we um uh I developed the attitude I I was the Oddball I didn't dance didn't go to the parties didn't smoke didn't drink all that so they knew I was kind of strange and I was just a born again Christian the Baptist Church you know well so then one day this girl comes up to me she's I barely knew who she was and she says now we know you're you're kind of you know picky but um we know just the girl for you well Rebecca apparently had been there a couple weeks more and I didn't know she wasn't into my class es so they um she said well uh her name is Rebecca yeah where is she she way over there getting on the bus so the next day I met Rebecca brandham and sure enough most beautiful girl I'd ever seen and especially with that southern accent you know out in Arizona and so um but then had to meet her dad well I never heard that name before so it didn't didn't register you know and all she said my dad's a preacher you got to talk to him so as it turns out they they had an apartment they rented uh for the about three years anyway they they landed they rent into an apartment and it was like a block from my house wow predestination you know didn't have to go shopping didn't have to spend a bunch of money or anything and so I go and talk to the man and here he was in the backyard with no shirt on you know messing with the plants and stuff and so she introduces me and then disappeared and here I'm talking to well I never heard never heard that name didn't know anything about Ministry at all so we just talked and so maybe 15 20 minutes and he um uh I forget what questions he asked I don't remember any of that but we were just talking and so he um he gave me permission I could I could date her well I had the victory but he had the problem because there were some other guys that kind of waiting their turn but game's over you know so he had to announce that publicly kid here my girl's going with um and that's how I met her and we we finished um uh that was the middle of the 11th year so we had a year and a half school together we graduated together in May of 1964 that was when the first Mustangs came out 6 four to have so do that answer your question you two are pretty quiet over there Sur you're thinking of something more nervous was oh I was already in by then but I was I tried to be careful because I know you could see through me so there was no telling any stories or anything you know and so we uh we couldn't have any dates during the week cuz you know we're at school and then uh really the only time we had a date was probably Friday night because Saturday night had to get ready for church and everything and so they lived in this duplex apartment and so you know we'd walk up to the door and here you know saying good night and everything all of a sudden this light comes on right about six and a half feet you know porch light and um kind of bothersome you know so light comes on little hand comes out I put a quarter in the hand hand goes back light goes off real simple and I know whose hand it was so that was my brother-in-law's earliest experiences in separating Believers from their cash and when he heard me tell the story you know he's had got to have a comeback and he said you wasn't even a believer at the time I said well your your dad thought so the story yeah it was um quite an experience did you ever get in trouble with what uh yeah there was once or twice and I should have you know zipped it but uh he was very kind they let it go you know whatever you did must been B enough that the what I said whatever you did must been bad enough not repeat yeah it was you know it's not necessary yeah I know if you're in it with Brad I take it all into consideration if he's the hero here I'll I'll blame for yeah well um as I you know spent more time around him and he didn't give me a bunch of tapes or anything to listen to he just accepted me for what I was because he could see that I was a Christian mean he tells that story on one of the questions that answers in August of 64 says that she was you know playing the wrong of music and all this business and and um he said but then she met George he's a Christian and it the problem well I was taken to the Baptist church every Sunday so because there was no church in Tucson at the time and so uh as I learned more about him and wow it's right here in the Bible and there was no books back then there was just a life story book and Prophet South Africa um I realized that this is real and you know it's worth investing in a whole life so I think it was in July of 64 that I wrote a letter to the Baptist Church told him take my name off you know not coming back but um whole thing about the message it's scriptural see it's not just another idea like the Catholics at their idea they're all in this thing together they all have the same Bible we have but they they they have the same basic Doctrine they got a few little differences now this is this is life this is re reality and it's right there in scripture so once you see William brandom in the scripture well then there's no choice sck with it you know and um so I tell people today that what you have to do if a person says I believe the Bible well then let's look in here there's places where God uses the spirit of Elijah five times oh never saw that before well then once you see that well then what do you have to say well then can testify but um now the Baptist Church they they uh thought I was crazy and you know I was the first of 10 children so I was supposed to you know follow in the footsteps and I didn't so they always had respect for brother Adam they didn't never they never say anything bad about him they just didn't understand you know question what would you say all the things outside of that in his character well that he had a lot of Grace he didn't jump to conclusions see like when when they moved to Arizona um it was because of a vision didn't have didn't ask for permission you know and they didn't know how long they would stay they get their clothes go west because they were going to tear up the driveway and okay so in reality you're thinking well as soon as I get the driveway fix we'll move back but anyway so out west with their just their clothes well at that point Rebecca had been with the same kids from the first grade and here she was in the middle of the 11th grade bad time to move she had had already like almost 10 years of classical piano piano at the house every day no piano out west um it was radically different no trees no church no friends but anyway so the girl at the corner uh her mother was a a piano teacher she had a grand piano well that's she gravitated there so um that's the girl that introduced us you know but um so one day brother R was getting family ready for supper going going out to eat there's only three kids okay there's only two where's Rebecca well she's at the corner we'll pick her up on the way so when he stops to go up to the door he's not hearing chopan or bethoven or down at the cross it's rock and roll because this other girl is just yeah yeah 20 20 fingers on one piano two girls you know and so he's about to lose it J so he knocks on the door and miraculously they heard she comes to the door he didn't jerk his belt off for nothing he said it's time to go so we go and she didn't hear another word about it for two months course the parents are praying and then as he tells the story there in ' 64 that um then she met me and I was taking her to church and and end of that problem you know wow yeah real simple but at the time looked like the end of the world so he was a lot of Grace and he knew when people were telling him the truth and when they weren't but he he was real cool and you could treat him all the same you know and you'd think that was his best friend but it was causing him the most problem you know yeah what about that one well Bert yeah I never met him okay but see there's an example here's a just a worldly guy he was a good shot he was a good Hunter somehow they teamed up and also uh like the Dr adir he talks about Sam adir in Jeffersonville well see brother br's neighbor was Mrs May well Mrs May was a nurse at the hospital and when she found out that the Reverend Brandon next door and Dr adir were close friends she couldn't just couldn't fathom that because Adar had a bad bad mouth he was just bad but somehow they were close friends you know so he uh he didn't judge people he was just kind now he knew how to stay away from people that are really bad but um yeah that that guy actually became a Christian and and became a deacon and Baptist Church I think brother B tells that part yeah so what else years ago you told a story about don't remember the details something to do with Cadillac driving it well okay first of all back in the 60s Cadillac was just the ultimate car European cars had come over here very much so the Christian businessman which is a big organization wanted to buy him a nice car they were buying other people Cadillacs they want to buy him a Cadillac nope no Cadillac so um finally um brother Mar bright you've heard that name he was the treasurer of the organization and he got a new car every year so in like October or November of 55 he was getting delivery on his new 56 Cadillac so he got the keys to the 55 and gave it to these two guys you drive this to Jeffersonville just park it give him the keys don't talk to nobody just leave it there also brother RM comes home wow where' this come from this it's a huge car it's like from here to the next room you know and um big four-door had had a I think the engine was like 500 horsepower had two four barrel carburetors I mean it was nice it had air conditioning real nice air okay so he puts it in the garage and um wasn't going to drive it deal with this later so after several months he puts a little disclaimer in the newspaper said that um I'm going to be driving this blue and white car I didn't buy it with your money somebody gave it to me and explained it all so when they went to Arizona they drove that also okay so they they have it out there well so sometimes he would say hey why don't you take my car tonight well I was young but I wasn't stupid you know that's great idea but my Ford truck I could put the regular gas in it which was 22 cents a gallon MH but his car needed the premium that was 36 Cents a gallon so and there was no self- pump you had to pull up and let the guy do it you know so we we'd drive that sometimes and we'd pull up and get $3 worth of gasoline and so one day we're coming home from school driving this Cadillac and Rebecca lived a block this way and I lived a block down that way and so as we we're you know negotiating the turn I looked down there to see if anybody was at my house well I cut it too short and right behind the front tire it caught this fire hydrant Crunch and so oh now what are I'm going to do so of course he saw it and he wouldn't let me pay for it they fixed it for like $50 he wouldn't let me pay for it and you know there was that where that where we hit that thing it was always greener there but I guess it busted something wasn't wasn't a real big hit but anyway it was always Greener right around that thing when I was out there last week I looked and sure enough they already removed it so this channel it some other way but um yeah that's the story about the about the Cadillac I don't be thinking of a question for Sunday because we're not going to have questions and answers on Sunday but we will start on time and I want you all to be there and show people that it's possible well just what's on tape he never said more than that and um he never that I remember he never mentioned the fact that his trainer was named George Smith but that's part of his story Smith yeah 6 second Smith but that was way back when he was you know 18 19 years old 20 what's your best memory well there's a lot of them um we've mentioned a few things best memory would probably be when I was praying with some brothers for the Holy Ghost and and he called about then because I was in Texas and he was in Arizona and um and as we were praying we're just three guys praying you know and I in my mind I could see like a cloudy sky with uh openings where you know rays of Sun come down through the clouds and um and one of those raises coming to me I guess and so about then he called for those other brothers he was calling them they'd been waiting for the call but he said first let me talk to George okay so I greeted him and he said I want to be first to congratulate you on receiving the Holy Ghost so that was always pretty special wow yeah and so all these years later not so much that he said it but that something really happened and it got bigger every day but it's a real vindication any what me no other people have dreams and tell me about it but I I was in it maybe um the other day this brother called me and he said um that he was like a fly on the wall because he could see brother Brand's living room and he said that um sister Brandon was in one chair and brother Neville was in another chair and me and Rebecca were sitting by the fireplace and so we're just talking so directly brother Neville gets up to leave and sister Brandon sees him to the door and so they're over there by the door and they said to Rebecca hey come here well I have one right here um brother Neville died in 74 and sister R died in 81 and Rebecca died in 06 so you know they're in one category I'm still sitting by the fireplace and so they look back at me in the dream and they said you keep doing what you're doing so that's why I'm here tonight still doing what I'm doing so there's been things like that but not what I dreamed my dreams don't last over 10 minutes when I wake up it's all gone I heard it's really really rare to well I don't know it's depends what God wants show you sister well she was very very German everything had to be in order yeah she couldn't go to bed at night if there was a dirty sock some place everything had to be done yeah there was I don't know what percentage but anyway she she was like that and the thing is they were raised very poor when she was young uh she said that come to the end of the month they were moving because you know Ren St okay forget this get your mattress and take off and so uh to her anything that's that's old is trash if we're not using it that'll hear it very practical yeah have a question um brother different people speak about how there was always people at their house all the time um so in or in my mind a lot of times I think people sitting out the yard or on the porch or just around the house the phone going off every few minutes and was it like that or was in my imagination no he tells uh something like that that phone's ringing all the time cuz it was a black phone on the wall with a dial had in cell phones and people would call and they wanted to talk to him and so there would be uh Rebecca says she'd come out to go to school and there's people laid on the on the porch you know so the the kids on the bus they're asking how come all these weird people well she said people love my dad so much and of course then she'd tell him about that he's going he just went over and prayed for King George you know in England so they'd make fun of that and so so oh is your dad still going to go you go pray for him no he's healed he not going back there so she was always on top of it you know wow but yeah there were people they would come and and he didn't have Yard Service he'd cut his own grass with you know power more but you had push it right and so he uh there's a picture I think inh one of the books where he's got this white coat on well it's August in Jeffersonville miserable so he was out there they cut the grass with no shirt on and and these people drove up they needed prayer so he ducked into the garage and got this raincoat on plastic raincoat and he goes and prays for him and they took pictures and so yeah a lot of that kind of stuff eventually they put a sign in the yard you need attention call this number and you know get on the list but yeah people just show up and if you had a you know sick child that's probably where you'd go you know I just can't imagine being a wife trying to keep my household together and keep things running and go people always being in my house and being on my porch and waking up and finding people in the yard and I just can't fathom that that would make me a nervous right okay see first of all they didn't have a nice house like this yeah two bedrooms one bath right so people in particular would come and maybe spend a week oh wow so somebody had to vacate the room right and the one bathroom and so here's sister brand trying to fix breakfast so she's trying to get the bacon out you know to get it on the to the paper towel and somebody grabs it how much that would you put up with oh my good I would probably be sitting in the corner crying yeah she had a tough life brother mom to be husband somebody oh there was it was the whole story out it was a miracle that we have a message that makes sense and it's clear and you know just a lot of things uh he was the thing is his family the ones before him they were all drunks and characters you know her people were too and so he was the one that made the difference yeah like something he did that I didn't like is that what you mean brother yes something like that well he he had a limit to his you know patience a lot of times but um yeah he he didn't like to see boys acting like girls that was really one of his pet peeps men like act like men so see the Lord knew when to take him because if he was to live today he'd go to the woods never come back he open the C would yeah what about sister uh they got along very well she was the one that most reflected his character wow yeah she was the firstborn you know and he would take her huntting or whatever so they got along real well yeah she was nature a lot like him yeah whatever happened to Sarah I don't know if you you find her let me know oh wow she married a basically a unbeliever and I always wonder never no no she's out there someplace well right she doesn't want to be found but see Billy died on the 19th of October and so she knew about it so she must be over there someplace so her friend called one of the relatives asked if she could come to the funeral well sure well she didn't show up so she doesn't want to get around us because she have to answer a lot of questions so better it's very sad in the services what stands out what stands out to you the most well the fact that he could be involed D with so many different people and yet come out there like cool as cucumber good evening friends and you know the way he gets started you know and spirit's all settled uh the Miracles were fantastic but the the preaching of the words that stick with what's written not inventing stuff and could have been and it was it was very um very refreshing oh this is the prophet of our age I don't know when that was but it was somewhere in the first year yeah because it's it's all Bible you know if it was Harry chrishna or something that you know was patched on or even the Mormons no this this is scripture and he was very careful that it would be scripture yeah got to be personal to each person and you're not going without the Holy Ghost so funniest memory well let's see funniest memory um I don't know um I don't think about that but he's he's a real jokester you know oh he could pull some fast ones and but uh he was just very very normal but see like he would see a situation and then Sunday he's preaching and he's comes from way over here someplace and telling this story about three days later you realize oh that's me in that story [Music] yeah I bet that embar up in their seat and hid under the pews yeah so his brother Jason preached about you a lot occasion you give him reason toor what question oh he thinking did you get involved very good question after I was baptized on the second day of August 65 then we got in the station wagon and we went to Tucson and so by then I um I've been out of school for a year you I had baptism right and I had the girl under contract cuz she had the ring and I had a car so I'm kind of making progress so we're driving around in my car and uh brother Ram says now if you ever get a chance to go to Israel your Bible will be a new book well that kind of went over because I wasn't thinking about Israel thinking about the girl you know and so um we um I don't know 1970s three we made our first trip and uh sure enough it's so small it's right there and so then in 84 we took our first group and this past June uh was group number 48 so and it might be the last because there war and there's no tourism yeah yeah that's how I got started so I don't know how much of it he saw he didn't say any more about it well he didn't just yeah no I know he he he would carry on and he might get quiet or he might go in the other room you know but um he those Visions it might take a minute now the way he tells it B old long story it's like a dream you know really when you dream that that could be two minutes worth but you see all these details you know and that's the same with him um you wouldn't know it yeah and he didn't tell all that he knew either so but the main thing is stick with the scripture because like it says in Galatians 1:8 that you know Paul had been there he had baptized some of these people now he comes back and already these strange people came through you got to do this you got to do that he said look I preached under inspiration you know here's a revelation if I come back or Silas or if you know our big friend here or whoever comes over and says something different going down to stick with the original and that was what was great about brother BR is he he preached scripture he he had the same story all the way through he didn't change it it's on some tapes well yeah they they uh the people making the tape okay uh sometimes they would turn the volume down but most of the time he would just be quiet well maybe it's something we need to know right now uh but that's why he had to put in the church or okay that's all good but while I'm preaching you know we don't do that before do it after uh but he preached everywhere so a lot of people didn't pay attention to that now they they could have made better tapes uh we won't get into that ancient history now but yeah brother George your memory talking about this is my d he brother George speak to the condition things were From perspective during the trying time Gap also well the family um didn't see him when he was out like that he was gone they were at the house you know but he was a very high strung person and he had just had enough me here he is seeing all these Visions all these Miracles all these people been healed but people were coming for the for the fish fishes and Loaves they weren't catching what he was saying and so he human he'd had enough man I wish I could just go out and do that forget all this but of course God wouldn't let him you know I mean I've felt that way himself I went on vacation for the first time this past July I think it was and I'd always wanted to go on one those flat boats in Europe you know go down the river so got of the range nobody knew who I was it was nice just nobody wanted a picture nothing it was just seven days by myself well that's the way brother Rand was he liked to go out hunting and be out there but then some of these other guys started going with him well it wasn't much to a vacation with 10 guys with but um yeah on that occasion there he he just had enough for getet it but U and then there's the there's your name on the mountains but see interesting thing about his name um we got used to his name being William Maran random the two RS okay well he didn't like that name at all he just didn't like it his last driver's license the last driver's license he had in ' 65 says Marvin he invented a name just get away from that you know and so then sometime after that no it's just say something he dreamed up and so then after that driver's license so somewhere in the last year or two of his life the Lord showed him the truth of of Maran it has to do with all you people right here in the state because during the Revolutionary War when there was the man called the was it the river rat okay so he was kind of in between you know swamp fo Swamp Fox so he came through a yard and they would just come in take anything they want and keep going well he came into this yard and uh there was no men because they were in the war and here's this lady and she's very pregnant so he was very nice to her you know they didn't steal anything just had a meal and so because he was so nice to her she named the child Marion and from then till today there's a Maran in the family that's where that comes from yeah that question uh so um he have aor yeah he like Fords I mean like the Ford station wagon yeah back then see he he drove General Motors until they come up with the V8 as long as they were straight he had the he had Pontiac whatever ever but then when they came to the V8 he figured that Ford had a better motor so from that on okay was he strict when it came strict about what well yeah there were some rules you know um the uh sad part is he probably saw in Vision more than he wanted to see and didn't say anything but but he he had some rules yeah he um they would travel to like from Jeffersonville Tucson okay so they he like to go early like six o'clock we rolling I'll go to sleep we're going to get there so he' drive and drive and drive well he get tired he pull over everybody be quiet for 10 minutes people so he would take a power nap get up go another four hours you know so they get to this little town I was with them that time and they whatever Town it was in Oklahoma probably and so um it's summertime so 8-year-old Joseph says uh let's get a hotel with a pool it was his request you know and so keeps driving well he gets the last Motel you know before leaving town and it didn't have a pool well the random way is to just slow boil you know not get mad but get even so and so everybody goes in the room cleans up and he sweeps out the car and and now we're going to get in the car and go back to you know supper well as soon as they stop at this little you know place for supper there's a little band out there rock and roll Joe jumps out he starts Jing with these guys oh yeah well soon as he got back to the hotel he got wore out he took the belt out of him yeah yeah dating what was your age well when we met we were 17 we married at 20 you know married in March of 66 okay uh the rules were you had to be in by 11: and one time we we were um sitting in my pickup and it's you know probably quarter to 11 or something and so I'm I'm stopped on the wrong side of the street you know they lived on the left side and I just stopped there well there's no lights anywhere you know street lights but nobody's coming so here comes this car way down there starts coming with the bright lights on so I pull on my lights bright just to let him know that you lights dimmed wouldn't you know it's him he circles and Parks right behind us you know that was very embarrassing he never said a word about it you know he trusted us so yeah yeah he I like I told my kids look I'm going to trust you until you give me reason not to then Hammer comes down but my kids are good liars you know I have two boys and a girl in the middle and so you know they were 18 months apart and so something would you know get broken or something went wrong oh nobody knew nothing about it of course well so they all got the weapon then it' be better if you tell the truth oh yeah yeah he blasted it all the time uh they hadn't figured out on their own that the high heels were you know giving them back trouble and different things so he came down hard on that people get rid of their high heels but yeah girls like to look fashionable okay that's fine and girls love attention we all know that right brother jie but there's limits you know uh you go showing off and you're going to attract all kinds of weird people you only want one guy that is the right guy and you asked yeah I had to ask him well it was in a little bit intense um and we're in the room by oursel and and he starts talking about trips I don't know what all kinds of stuff and after a long time I said no brother BR this is all wonderful but I I come for a reason you know set this time up aside for a reason oh what would that be and I said well you must notice that I really like your daughter and I said I'm here to ask for your permission and your blessing to marry her it's kind of be nice you know so then the eyes get real narrow and he said now look I'm going to give you guys permission to be engaged but don't even think about marriage until you both have the baptism of Holy Ghost yeah he says because you see what happens to those that haven't waited and so we put it aside and then I received the Holy Ghost would be the end of September and within a week I was a US Soldier with the Holy Ghost gone and then he left the scene in Christmas and so then when we get to March of 66 I knew what God had done for me and I knew God had done something for her so I called her from Louisiana I said hey let's get married next Tuesday sure enough last Tuesday so we had a private ceremony at the house and then we took off and after two weeks I went to Vietnam for a year so trial by fire brother Collins mared us he was one of the ministers the time wasn't spiritual grow daily prayer I'm asking what we do yeah when he was just home by himself uh he he spent a lot of time in prayer he would go up in the canyon and he'd go different places just hiking you know by himself but uh he spent a lot of time cleaning his guns and loading the ammunition and a lot of things you know but yeah his his secret was was the prayer life and he get up early when everybody else still sleep yeah five yeah yeah yeah well if you guys live long enough you'll realize that you can do with less sleep right are you taking notes of all this are you dood are you doodling yeah what else uh that would probably be at the top of the list but like when he was preaching the the anointed ones at the end time one of the powerful messages we have I was sitting from me to you you know from him when he's preaching that but it's just kind of drifted over only when you get it in in print and then course translating it going over every phrase you know and now I really got it yeah tell them what what your role was about well when I got back from the Army in October of 67 uh the printing work had already begun and they were you know putting books together and everything but there had been somebody that had translated a couple messages but there was nobody around that could do the type setting to get ready for press so they hired me for that and so I realized when I'm going through that okay there's something do this doesn't flow here something's not right so I got the tape well sure enough they left out a paragraph you know and so I had to kind of redo it and get it ready um and that's when I got started but then I got into full-time just translating and that is a real chore because you got to take Kentucky English which people in you know those other countries what is he saying and the people here that are in charge they have the attitude that that it's got to be exactly what he said Well we'd like to think that what we have in the Bible is ex exactly what he said but this is something that came down through several translators and okay it makes sense and this is probably real close to what he said but there's no such thing as word for word translation it's just not anywhere in any language you translate the phrase this is what this says because they have to understand what he's saying you know we want them to have the same blessing that we have uh when they're listening or reading it and that's been the success like of seal book and different things that it's it's it's what it says you know and so I've been ministering for over 50 years and and translating sermons and staying busy brother George I guess it's generally what would you and I not to put you on the spot but what would you to the young people right what do you what would you summarize just to say spiritually yeah well um there's a a formula to stay balanced and we'll go over again Sunday but you like to take notes and you like to you know rules um if you'll read at least one chapter out of your Bible every day and make a point to go through the Bible in one year or sooner there's there's on the phone there's schedules you know knowing your Bible is very very important um because when brother br's preaching like when I'm translating I got to know when he's quoting scripture he doesn't always say John 1 says this he's going along he'll drop in a quotation well if you don't know it's Bible it's not going to get any quotation marks you know um one chapter a day bible one page a day of your church age book listen to at least 20 minutes of the tape surely you can find time for this and you pray at anytime if you follow those four steps you will have a more Balanced Life and things will make more sense to you but and it's something anybody can do chapter page 20 minutes don't feel better about yourselfer most recently just realiz the world's going away things that I like to do with my physical flesh that happy temporarily but after you're done I immedately why I yeah well and the cell phone is a great way to waste time you go to look for something and you go you get way over here what was I looking for yeah it happens to me but um yeah you got to make time because just like your body needs water needs nourishment you can't go 24 hours without drinking water and you can't go very long without eating food well the soul needs to be fed also it's a similar equation so you you feed the soul by reading God's word it works okay a lot of quiet people but if we were giv out ice cream it'd be a little more noise me well we talked up long enough they'll mess up but I have been deceived along the way yeah yeah no there's um there's a lot of people carrying tablet carrying books they're not all going to heaven just you know because you got the stuff doesn't mean you're going anywhere it's got to be on the inside so it's your age four steps okay no I've heard about it but I've never been in the same place that's it awesome thank you brother well you're very welcome um I just wanted you all to participate yeah your service
