[0:00] blood to the doorpost first
[0:03] even if they did roast the lamb just
[0:05] like the prophet said the death angel
[0:07] would have steal God in the room
[0:09] they would have perished because there
[0:11] wasn't any blood to protect them
[0:14] we can eat this word and gain a head
[0:16] knowledge but if we don't apply the
[0:18] blood to our lives and get Washed by the
[0:20] blood we will perish just like the rest
[0:24] I can see that little Sun
[0:27] it's a little boy in our city his father
[0:28] watched his father kill the lamb and
[0:30] take in the blood and spreading on the
[0:32] door
[0:32] what are you doing pop
[0:34] he said I'm applying the blood to her
[0:36] home
[0:37] because the death angel is going to pass
[0:39] and those that have the blood will die
[0:43] he said father you sure the blood's
[0:45] still there
[0:46] he'd go out and look and say it's still
[0:48] there
[0:49] that's what we need to do as fathers we
[0:51] need to apply the blood to our house
[0:54] apply the token so those kids would have
[0:57] confidence this house is covered by the
[0:59] blood
[1:00] go take another look dad
[1:02] you look around and say yes son he's
[1:04] still there
[1:06] how he said my blood is still there
[1:08] don't worry devil
[1:10] can't cross the bloodline
[1:13] Hallelujah
[1:15] they were told to eat the lamb after the
[1:17] blood was applied
[1:19] and the lamb was cooked over fiery we
[1:22] can't start eating the lamb this word
[1:23] until the blood has been applied to our
[1:25] doorpost the soul
[1:28] and been set on fire with the Holy Ghost
[1:30] and then we start eating our lamb
[1:34] our word
[1:36] not until we have fire of God down in
[1:38] the soul can we start feeding on the
[1:40] body word of the son of man
[1:42] just like Israel eating their lamb it
[1:44] was given them the strength they would
[1:46] need
[1:47] for the body
[1:49] to get ready for travel
[1:51] we are eating our way to a body change
[1:53] to a Rapture eat more
[1:57] eat more of this word feed on this word
[1:59] verse 8 says they shall eat the Flesh in
[2:01] that night and roast with fire
[2:03] unleavened bread with bitter herbs they
[2:06] shall eat it
[2:08] well around State communion was held
[2:10] first way down in Egypt the first of the
[2:13] communion which was the Passover Lamb
[2:15] that was slain which was a type of
[2:17] Christ
[2:18] and when they come out there wasn't a
[2:20] feeble one among them
[2:22] and there even their clothes was not
[2:24] even threadbare for 40 years God had
[2:26] kept them
[2:27] and in taking communion was a difference
[2:29] between life and death
[2:31] those who are on the inside under the
[2:33] shed blood took to communion and no one
[2:35] could take communion outside being under
[2:37] the shed blood this right here is a
[2:39] matter of life and death
[2:42] this right here is a matter of life and
[2:45] death
[2:46] Hallelujah they must come under the
[2:48] blood first and be cleansed from all sin
[2:50] which is unbelief and then be shot with
[2:53] the preparation of the Gospel
[2:55] having the whole armor of God ready for
[2:58] summons at any time
[3:01] we got to be ready at any time because
[3:03] the summons is coming
[3:04] it was a sign that a death angel could
[3:06] not go beneath that blood
[3:09] the death angel had to rise up and go
[3:11] over the blood
[3:13] and theirs were the post Point got the
[3:16] inspiration saying when I see the blood
[3:19] I will pass over you
[3:21] verse 9 says eat not of it raw nor
[3:24] sodden at all with water but roast it
[3:27] with fire
[3:28] his head with his legs with the
[3:30] pertinence thereof they were to eat the
[3:32] entire lamb
[3:35] and ye shall let nothing of it remain
[3:37] until the morning and that wish
[3:40] remaineth of it until morning you shall
[3:42] burn with fire
[3:44] brother I said none of it is to remain
[3:46] everything he said when you eat it don't
[3:49] eat it raw or sodden but you must eat it
[3:51] well cooked
[3:53] people try to chew on this word
[3:56] they try to eat this word they take it
[3:58] like it was raw chew on and spit it spit
[4:00] it on it and everything else oh I can't
[4:03] take that he says I can't stand it is it
[4:06] cooked done enough
[4:08] and he says cook it with fire fire
[4:10] represents the Holy Ghost you get God in
[4:14] your heart first it'll cook it for you
[4:16] it'll cook it for you Hallelujah
[4:20] cook it with fire
[4:22] that's right cooked it out done seasoned
[4:25] and it tastes good
[4:28] except you eat the Flesh of the son of
[4:30] man what do you think a doctor would
[4:32] have thought sitting there
[4:34] when he says
[4:36] you have to eat my flesh and drink my
[4:38] blood this man's a vampire
[4:42] not a minister stay away from that man
[4:45] he's crazy stay away from him
[4:48] except you eat it he says you'll perish
[4:51] you all die if you don't eat it that's
[4:54] the same thing today the bread and the
[4:55] wine is only a symbol don't let the
[4:58] natural get you down you've got to eat
[5:00] Christ which is the word that you live
[5:03] by every word that precedes out of his
[5:05] mouth
[5:06] the son of man is Christ
[5:09] he's the one you're feeding on
[5:12] oh if he says you hadn't fit fully on
[5:13] every word to give yourself strength to
[5:15] Fly Above these denominations and the
[5:16] things of the world you'll never get
[5:18] over it
[5:20] verse 11 and you shall eat it with your
[5:22] loins girded your shoes on your feet
[5:24] your staff in your hand and you shall
[5:25] eat it in haste it is the Lord's
[5:27] Passover
[5:29] it's the same it's the same today as in
[5:32] Egypt when he ate the lamb they were to
[5:34] dress to leave
[5:36] as that's this bride we have our helmet
[5:38] our shield on
[5:39] well we have our shield in our shoes or
[5:42] and or we are eating we're ready
[5:45] we're ready to go
[5:47] we're still fighting but we're also
[5:48] eating we're dressed and we're ready for
[5:50] this battle we're here for this journey
[5:51] eat this message eat this word and
[5:53] you'll see your body change right before
[5:55] your eyes
[5:57] verse 12 and I will pass to the legend
[5:59] of Egypt this night will Smite all the
[6:01] first born in the land of Egypt both man
[6:03] and Beast against all gods of Egypt I
[6:06] will execute judgment for I am the Lord
[6:09] Hallelujah John chapter 6 verse 15 1 he
[6:13] says I am the living bread which came
[6:14] down from heaven
[6:16] that's who we're feasted on
[6:18] he shall live forever and the bread that
[6:20] I will give is my flesh and I will give
[6:22] for the life of the world
[6:24] and the Jews therefore stroke among
[6:26] himself saying how could this man give
[6:27] us his flesh to eat
[6:30] and then Jesus said unto them verily
[6:31] verily I say unto you except you eat
[6:35] which is consume and devour
[6:38] except you Devour the Flesh of the son
[6:41] of man and drink his blood you have no
[6:43] life
[6:45] whosoever eateth My Flesh and drinketh
[6:47] my blood hath eternal life and I will
[6:49] raise him up in the last day
[6:51] for my flesh is meet indeed and my blood
[6:54] is drink indeed and he that eateth my
[6:57] flesh and drinketh my blood dwells in me
[6:59] and I in him has the living father has
[7:02] sent me I live by the father so that he
[7:05] eateth me
[7:06] even he shall live by me
[7:08] and that is the bread which come down
[7:11] from heaven not as your fathers did eat
[7:13] manna and are dead and he that eateth of
[7:17] this bread shall live forever
[7:19] that's what we're eating on the body
[7:21] word of the son of man you are what you
[7:23] eat what are you eating Jeremiah 15 16
[7:26] says the words were found and I did eat
[7:29] them
[7:30] and Thy Word was unto me the joy and
[7:32] rejoicing of my heart for I am called by
[7:35] thy name oh first you got to apply the
[7:37] blood to get Sanctified cleaned out
[7:39] baptized get your house in order this
[7:42] house get rid of sin 11. get it out of
[7:45] your home you got to get your shoes on
[7:47] get dressed for the journey eat the word
[7:50] eat this lamb eat all of it you can't
[7:53] just have you can't pick out what you
[7:54] like
[7:57] it's not a menu you're right you just
[8:00] can't go through here and say I want
[8:01] this part oh I can't eat that you've got
[8:04] to eat the entire word
[8:07] these Jews they come up each year there
[8:09] was a fountains inside the church and
[8:11] they taken the bread and the bitter
[8:13] herbs and the lamb they drink from this
[8:14] fountain in the church and they Rejoice
[8:16] together because that God had showed
[8:18] them favor so this being the Passover
[8:20] time
[8:21] it was a special Passover that's
[8:23] sometimes we go to church
[8:25] and we always love to go
[8:29] I do and there are sometimes that
[8:31] something special happens yeah
[8:34] I expect something special to happen
[8:36] today and this was one of those times
[8:38] talk about children of Israel in her
[8:41] house get ready to go the air was
[8:43] charged with expectancy just as it is
[8:45] today are we expecting something are we
[8:48] expecting a Rapture there's a charge in
[8:51] the air the air is charged with
[8:53] expectancy we are expecting an exodus
[8:56] once again eat this word not just part
[8:58] of it you gotta eat it all
[9:01] all the eyes were of those who loved him
[9:04] was watching for him to come to the gate
[9:05] and I believe it's a great deal that way
[9:08] today for those who love him are looking
[9:10] for him the air is charged with
[9:13] expectancy it's almost Rapture morning
[9:17] it's almost Resurrection morning
[9:19] eat the word these things of the world
[9:22] won't matter to you
[9:23] it don't matter if your favorite
[9:24] football team won or lost
[9:28] all that stuff used to bother me
[9:31] until I got saved
[9:35] I guess because I got used to my team
[9:36] losing so I got used to it
[9:40] because of what you're eating now
[9:43] your diet has been changed
[9:45] we're no longer feasting on the world
[9:48] we're feasting on God
[9:50] the Holy Spirit feeds on the word
[9:56] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[9:58] every word that proceeds out of the
[9:59] mouth of God that's what's the matter
[10:01] one of these things today that makes the
[10:03] church in the anemic condition is
[10:05] because it don't take time to feed the
[10:07] word
[10:08] feed on the word the church is hungry if
[10:10] I was a doctor and a great big Stout
[10:12] looking man come to me and said sir I'm
[10:13] sick
[10:15] what are your symptoms
[10:16] I'm so weak I can't hardly pick my hands
[10:19] up
[10:20] ask him a few physical conditions yeah
[10:21] that's right well sir have you been
[10:24] eating regularly oh I hate a half a
[10:26] cracker day before yesterday
[10:29] he says you're just hungry
[10:31] you need strength you need to eat
[10:34] that's what's the matter with the church
[10:35] today
[10:37] just read a little scripture one other
[10:39] verse on a Sunday morning we ought to
[10:41] have our head this word every minute we
[10:42] have to spare and take a lot of time and
[10:46] lay something else
[10:48] besides to read to that word man shall
[10:51] not live by bread alone but by every
[10:53] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[10:55] God
[10:55] our Delight should be in the word of the
[10:58] Lord to meditate on God's word as it
[11:00] says in Psalms 1.
[11:02] we can't keep the victory
[11:05] because of what we're feeding on we
[11:07] can't feed on the world and the things
[11:08] of the world we will never be victorious
[11:12] we go from service to service barely
[11:14] making it through
[11:15] wow barely made some some of us is going
[11:18] to be coming to the Gate of Heaven and
[11:20] we just fall through the door
[11:22] we don't have the strength enough
[11:25] to make it to the gate
[11:28] I'm telling you where your strength is
[11:30] today we're going to have to have
[11:31] strength because we can't take a Rapture
[11:34] without it
[11:36] Hallelujah you got five minutes I better
[11:38] hurry eating our way to a body change
[11:44] Hallelujah
[11:47] forgot something here that's when we get
[11:49] get to real quick
[11:52] went ahead and skipped a little bit
[11:54] I could see that
[11:56] should have Israel down in Egypt
[11:59] when they're sitting there eating the
[12:00] lamb
[12:02] and the old Grandpa's sitting over there
[12:04] feeble
[12:05] can hardly move
[12:07] I can see the
[12:09] somebody in the house say here take this
[12:10] word right here
[12:13] faith is a substance of things hoped for
[12:15] and he started chewing on it
[12:19] he started getting a little strong
[12:21] he felt something starting to change in
[12:23] him he said here take this the spoken
[12:25] word is the Original Seed
[12:29] he started eating on that the more he
[12:32] ate the stronger he got
[12:35] Hallelujah
[12:36] the next one he said you got to eat this
[12:38] one dad
[12:40] the rapture
[12:42] he started eating that
[12:45] and then they got the summons he got
[12:47] stronger
[12:48] he said what do you got more for me
[12:51] it's the coming of the lord it's Exodus
[12:54] time
[12:55] oh brother sister keep your head in this
[12:57] word it's Rapture time
[13:01] the more you eat the stronger you become
[13:05] that's why the Bible says there was not
[13:07] a feeble one among them
[13:09] it's all because of what they eat the
[13:12] night of the Exodus
[13:14] so what are you eating the night of the
[13:15] Resurrection
[13:17] if tomorrow morning was the resurrection
[13:19] what are you going to be eating
[13:22] you are what you eat
[13:25] so if you're eating the word you become
[13:28] the resurrection
[13:29] you'll become the word of God speaking
[13:34] I feel like preaching
[13:37] but I'll leave that to the preacher here
[13:38] in a little bit
[13:40] hallelujah what are you eating on
[13:44] just ask yourself that question you are
[13:48] what you eat
[13:50] you become it
[13:52] he's like that caterpillar
[13:55] before we become a butterfly he starts
[13:57] munching around over he starts eating
[13:59] and the more he eat the more his body
[14:01] starts changing one day he started
[14:03] fluttering and grew wings and started
[14:04] flying that's what we're going to be one
[14:06] day we might be a little caterpillar but
[14:07] the more we eat
[14:10] we're gonna Sprout wings
[14:13] hallelujah we're gonna Sprout rings and
[14:15] we're going to take away this Rapture
[14:17] we're going
[14:18] Lord
[14:20] let it be today
[14:22] I want today to be the resurrection
[14:25] I'm eating my way to the Rapture let's
[14:29] all stand
[14:34] I thought we'd just thank you for this
[14:36] little messed up thought Lord but father
[14:38] I hope I got it across father knowing
[14:40] that we're going to eat our way into a
[14:42] Rapture father
[14:43] Lord we come hungry father may you bless
[14:46] this service the singing the special
[14:48] singing most of our brothers he brings
[14:49] forth the word you know what's on his
[14:51] heart God
[14:52] father May that anointing just drop down
