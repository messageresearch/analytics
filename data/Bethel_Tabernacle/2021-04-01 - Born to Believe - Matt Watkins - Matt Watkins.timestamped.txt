[32:49] amen let me make sure i'm in the right
[32:50] spot here
[32:54] let's go to numbers actually numbers not
[32:56] deuteronomy
[33:01] yes numbers chapter 13.
[33:03] amen i'd like to just minister to you
[33:05] tonight on something the lord just
[33:07] placed upon my heart
[33:08] and i would like to title this born to
[33:11] believe born to
[33:13] believe
[33:14] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[33:16] send thou men that they may search the
[33:19] land of canaan which i give unto the
[33:21] children of israel
[33:22] of every tribe of their fathers shall
[33:25] you send a man
[33:26] everyone a ruler among them and moses by
[33:29] the commandment of the lord sent from
[33:31] the woof sent them from the wilderness
[33:33] of piranha
[33:35] all those men or heads of the children
[33:38] of israel verse 17
[33:41] and moses sent them to spy out the land
[33:44] of canaan
[33:46] and said unto them get you up this way
[33:48] southward and go up into the mountain
[33:51] and see the land what it is and the
[33:53] people that dwell therein
[33:55] whether they be strong or weak few or
[33:58] many
[33:59] and what the land is that they dwell in
[34:01] whether it be good or bad and what
[34:03] cities they be that they dwell in
[34:06] whether in tents
[34:08] or in strongholds
[34:10] i'd like to just turn over now
[34:12] if we could just for one more scripture
[34:14] reading to the book of galatians
[34:22] hebrews
[34:23] i have my notes backwards i i changed
[34:25] the uh the notes around so just forgive
[34:27] me hebrews chapter 4 galatians is next
[34:30] we'll have you be seated before that
[34:32] hebrews chapter 4 verse 1.
[34:38] let us therefore fear
[34:40] last a promise being left for us
[34:44] of entering into his rest any of you
[34:47] should seem to come short of it
[34:49] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[34:52] well as unto them but the word preached
[34:54] did not profit them not being mixed with
[34:58] faith and film that heard it for we
[35:00] which have believed to enter into rest
[35:03] as he said as i have sworn in my wrath
[35:06] if they shall enter into my rest
[35:08] although the works were finished
[35:11] from the foundation of the world let's
[35:13] just keep going here just for a moment
[35:15] verse 6.
[35:16] see and therefore it remaineth that some
[35:18] must enter therein and they to whom it
[35:21] was first preached entered not in
[35:23] because of one simple reason he doesn't
[35:27] there's many mistakes that you read
[35:29] about when you when you look at the
[35:31] lives of all of those who came out of
[35:34] egypt and crossed in
[35:35] and there's many reasons we could list
[35:37] we could find and the list would go long
[35:40] but notice he limits it just to one
[35:43] thing because of unbelief
[35:47] now remember what the prophet of god
[35:48] said what is sin it's unbelief
[35:52] use smoking well no it's drinking we'll
[35:54] know it's carousing what's this thing
[35:56] over here brother and said it's all
[35:58] linked those are symptoms of one
[36:01] problem
[36:02] unbelief amen
[36:04] i'm preaching i'm born to believe not
[36:06] born to be an unbeliever
[36:09] but born to be a believer
[36:11] are you a believer here tonight
[36:13] again he limited notice uh uh let's just
[36:16] stop right there and i'll have you be
[36:17] seated let's pray lord thank you for the
[36:19] reading of your word tonight lord it's
[36:22] truly our desire to be lord and a
[36:25] believer as you spoke lord in your word
[36:28] not of those who were unbelievers lord
[36:31] and those who failed because of unbelief
[36:33] lord but something in our hearts stirs
[36:36] lord and says i want to be a believer
[36:38] lord i want to believe all your word
[36:40] everything that's been written unto me
[36:42] let me take hold of it by faith now god
[36:45] as i minister what you've placed upon my
[36:47] heart i just ask for your grace lord and
[36:50] for your help for all of us lord we just
[36:52] raise our hands here tonight and ask you
[36:54] lord for your help here on this
[36:56] wednesday night those that'll listen in
[36:58] those that'll father stream this by
[37:00] archive those that are live listening
[37:02] and god may you just speak to them be
[37:04] lord be may your word be real unto each
[37:06] and every single person we ask we ask it
[37:09] in jesus christ's name and the church
[37:11] says amen amen you can be seated tonight
[37:22] if you have that um i'm gonna read
[37:25] something but not from that yet i just
[37:27] want to read one quote from the prophet
[37:29] that i didn't have
[37:31] um time to put up but i just like to
[37:33] read it to you listen to what he says
[37:35] here
[37:36] and he he's quoting here joshua one when
[37:39] he when he
[37:40] says what i'm about to read he's
[37:42] speaking about the scripture where it
[37:44] says that moses had died and it came to
[37:47] pass that that the lord spoke unto
[37:49] joshua the son of nun moses minister
[37:52] saying arise
[37:54] and go over this jordan thou and all the
[37:56] people
[37:57] uh unto a land which i do give thee even
[38:00] to the children of israel and then he
[38:02] says every place that the soul of your
[38:05] foot shall tread upon that have i given
[38:08] you
[38:08] as i said
[38:10] unto moses now listen to what brother
[38:12] branham says here that is the promise
[38:14] the promised land is to live
[38:18] very important not just visit
[38:21] not just once a week not even twice a
[38:23] week
[38:24] but he says the promised land is to live
[38:28] in this land of the holy spirit
[38:31] that's god's promise for the church is
[38:34] to live
[38:35] in the power
[38:37] of the spirit
[38:39] and then he stops and i wish i would
[38:41] have showed you this but but i didn't
[38:43] have time to put it on my notes
[38:45] he says it's the promised land us to
[38:47] live in the land of the holy spirit is
[38:49] to live in the power
[38:50] of his spirit it's another world it's
[38:54] another land you have to come out of the
[38:57] conditions
[38:58] that you've been in to come out to live
[39:02] in this promised land to receive the
[39:05] promise
[39:07] it's another land it's another world he
[39:10] says it's the power
[39:12] of the holy spirit we know and we're we
[39:15] we've taught many times before and i'm
[39:17] sure we know that when we read the book
[39:19] of joshua when you read the book of
[39:22] joshua and you read of how that god was
[39:24] going to take them into canaan a land
[39:26] that he had promised them and he swore
[39:29] unto abraham and god says in the souls
[39:31] of wherever the souls of your feet touch
[39:34] that's the promised land that i've given
[39:36] you i think as believers we know here
[39:38] tonight that god isn't looking to give
[39:40] us some physical land some geographical
[39:44] location there's a promise to the
[39:46] natural seed of abraham
[39:49] of a promised land that he gave and and
[39:51] david conquers most of all of that land
[39:54] and then they lose that that uh that
[39:56] promised land and then god restores it
[39:59] uh back through moses and then through
[40:01] joshua and they go over in there to
[40:03] conquer all of the land of canaan and
[40:06] the bible says you're to drive out all
[40:09] the inhabitants of the land everybody
[40:11] that's there all their pictures all
[40:12] their molten images and he says you're
[40:14] to go and possess the land that i've
[40:17] promised you
[40:18] all of it not some of it not just a
[40:20] portion
[40:21] but every single bit of it from the all
[40:23] the way from the north boundary to the
[40:25] south to the east to the west
[40:29] all that the land that i've promised you
[40:32] i've given unto you
[40:33] but you've got to go and fight for it
[40:36] you've got to go and drive out the enemy
[40:38] off of your land and you've got to have
[40:41] victory to take hold of the promise i've
[40:45] given you now to israel that was very
[40:47] natural spoke of a very literal piece of
[40:50] ground
[40:51] even today the promise that god has
[40:53] given israel is a physical location a
[40:56] promised land and brother adam says
[40:58] israel's back in her homeland but we
[41:01] know as believers that to the believer
[41:03] god is not looking to a natural piece of
[41:06] land but it's a spiritual condition that
[41:09] is promised to the believer that was
[41:11] promised through our father abraham that
[41:14] your seed shall possess the gates of his
[41:18] enemy
[41:19] and to the believer to you to me to our
[41:22] family to our children to our church
[41:24] that promise is still the promise to
[41:27] god's seed to abraham's seed that
[41:30] wherever the souls of your feet step on
[41:34] that i've given you and brother branham
[41:36] says what is that wherever you whatever
[41:39] you can believe by faith whatever you
[41:41] can claim in the holy spirit that i've
[41:44] given unto you
[41:45] all of the promises of god that god gave
[41:48] to abraham are to the believer now
[41:52] amen spiritual blessings you believe
[41:54] that
[41:54] and he says what is the promised land to
[41:56] the believer it's the land of the holy
[41:59] spirit so where are we to live in where
[42:02] are we to dwell over in israel somewhere
[42:04] it's good to take trips over to israel i
[42:06] would love to one day go see and go see
[42:09] jerusalem but god says you can go to
[42:11] spiritual jerusalem right now you can go
[42:14] to the spiritual promised land that i've
[42:17] given you right now in fact you can live
[42:20] there every day of your life
[42:23] amen
[42:24] because i've given it to you it's a
[42:26] promise
[42:27] what was that promise and it was to live
[42:29] in the land
[42:30] of the holy spirit it was to live in the
[42:33] power i love how brother adam says this
[42:35] it's to live in the power of the spirit
[42:39] it's another world
[42:41] it's another land it's not this world
[42:44] it's not this land it's not a land of
[42:47] unbelief it's not a land of doubt it's a
[42:49] land of faith it's not a land of
[42:51] sickness it's a land of healing amen
[42:54] it's not a land of fear it's a land of
[42:56] faith it's not a world that the world
[42:59] that we live in here today is a world
[43:01] that's gripping with fear gripping with
[43:04] anxiety field uh doctors offices filled
[43:08] with people with undiagnosable
[43:10] conditions mental conditions
[43:13] physical conditions hooked on uh put
[43:16] them on some type of pill to try to
[43:18] manage the anxiety or manage the
[43:20] depression but god says brother adam
[43:22] says that's not your promised land your
[43:24] promised land is a whole different world
[43:27] it's not a promised land of fear it's
[43:29] not that you're a believer and you're to
[43:31] live in fear but i've given you a
[43:33] promise that you can live in faith
[43:37] amen that you don't have to dwell in
[43:39] this condition of this world but you
[43:42] were born a believer you were born to
[43:45] live by his promises you were born to
[43:48] live you were made and born by the
[43:50] spirit of god
[43:52] to believe what the word of god said
[43:55] and to not doubt what the word of god
[43:57] says but to take hold
[43:59] on eternal life to take hold of the
[44:01] promises of god
[44:05] he says here and i want you just to
[44:07] follow this closely he says in
[44:08] deuteronomy chapter 7 if you have your
[44:10] bible i'd like you to turn to that if
[44:12] you could
[44:18] deuteronomy listen to what
[44:21] scripture says here
[44:28] and this is this is a commandment that
[44:30] god gives
[44:31] to moses deuteronomy chapter 7 brother
[44:34] if you have it you can put it on the
[44:35] screen verse 18. i just got it notated
[44:37] here deuteronomy 7 verse 18. now notice
[44:40] this commandment here he says thou shall
[44:42] not
[44:43] be afraid of them
[44:45] but shall well remember what the lord
[44:49] thy god
[44:50] did unto pharaoh
[44:52] and unto all egypt
[44:55] so he says
[44:57] thou shout now anytime we see that word
[44:59] we immediately think of a command
[45:01] because it's a command this isn't a
[45:04] suggestion this isn't hey uh uh to 10
[45:06] tips to live a a better life a more
[45:09] successful life
[45:10] this is a command that god commands them
[45:13] and says all of them's putting you into
[45:15] a land on a journey where there's going
[45:17] to be many things that would cause you
[45:19] to fear but god says i'm going to i'm
[45:22] going to i'm going to command you
[45:24] unthrough moses thou shalt not
[45:27] be afraid of them but remember what the
[45:30] lord thy god did unto pharaoh and unto
[45:34] all egypt in other words if you ever
[45:36] start to fear what the devil is doing to
[45:39] you in your life presently remember what
[45:42] god did for you in the past
[45:45] because what god the deliverance god
[45:47] gave you yesterday will give you
[45:49] strength to fight the enemy for today
[45:52] and god says anytime you start to fear
[45:54] what the enemy's doing and the enemies
[45:57] are
[45:58] messing up in your life just go back in
[46:00] your memory and say the same god who was
[46:03] with me a year ago has not changed his
[46:06] promise has not changed his word has not
[46:08] changed i will remember what god did and
[46:12] it'll give me strength to face my
[46:14] challenge today
[46:16] and he says thou shall not be keep that
[46:18] up if you could thou shall not be afraid
[46:20] of them but thou shalt remember
[46:23] thou shalt remember what the lord god
[46:25] did this this was a physical
[46:29] for israel this was a very real not an
[46:31] invisible spiritual war we face an
[46:34] invisible spiritual war here today as
[46:36] believers i know we have our physical
[46:38] challenges and some of us go through a
[46:39] lot of difficulties uh but we we fight a
[46:42] spiritual warfare that's why the
[46:44] ephesians six paul says that we don't
[46:46] wrestle against fleshly things
[46:48] not against flesh and blood but against
[46:50] spiritual wickedness can you say amen
[46:53] but for israel this was representing a
[46:55] real physical tangible army with real
[47:00] weapons
[47:01] and a real desire to destroy them they
[47:05] faced this where brother matt
[47:07] before uh kanan no in the promised land
[47:11] which was a type of the holy spirit to
[47:13] the believer they still face challenges
[47:16] in fact some of their greatest
[47:18] challenges they faced was not coming
[47:20] from egypt to canaan but it was after
[47:23] they had crossed through joshua the the
[47:26] who was a type of christ came into
[47:28] canaan some of their greatest challenges
[47:31] were waiting them after they had crossed
[47:34] into the land of promise
[47:38] we find that our greatest trouble and
[47:40] our greatest battle and our greatest
[47:41] struggle oftentimes is after we're born
[47:44] of the spirit of god we thought we had
[47:46] trouble back then but now we really know
[47:48] what real trouble really is
[47:50] for them it represented the well-armed
[47:53] uh heathen nation that was coming to
[47:55] destroy them you say brother matt what
[47:57] is it today it's a it's it's it's a real
[48:00] demon spirit
[48:02] you can label it whatever you want you
[48:04] could call it uh you could call it any
[48:06] addiction that you want you could call
[48:08] it any temptation or any sin that you
[48:10] want but behind every temptation is a
[48:13] real living spirit being called a demon
[48:17] spirit that wars with us every single
[48:21] day
[48:22] he warned with you this morning he ward
[48:24] with you he's warring with your mind
[48:26] right now whether you can see him or
[48:29] feel him or know what his name is
[48:32] he battled you this morning he's to try
[48:35] to stop you from coming to church here
[48:37] tonight and he's doing everything he can
[48:39] to prevent you from taking hold on what
[48:41] the lord is trying to say it's a real
[48:44] spiritual force a real spiritual
[48:48] difficulty and you know what god says
[48:51] god says about all of your problems
[48:53] you're not to fear them
[48:55] thou shall not fear
[48:58] them thou shall not be afraid of them
[49:02] right
[49:03] thou shalt not be afraid of them listen
[49:07] the lord knows every every temptation
[49:09] you could come under
[49:11] the bible says he was attempted in
[49:13] always
[49:14] of every way that you can fall under
[49:16] temptation the lord jesus
[49:18] experienced himself
[49:20] that's how he's a kinsmen redeemer
[49:21] that's how he's a high priest
[49:24] uh who can be touched by the feelings of
[49:26] our infirmities because he felt those
[49:28] same infirmities
[49:30] and now when we reach out to him in
[49:31] faith and in prayer god says i know what
[49:33] you're talking about i know what you're
[49:35] experiencing i know what you're fearing
[49:38] and here's what i want to tell you i
[49:39] already overcame it
[49:41] all you got to do is just trust me and
[49:43] believe for it
[49:44] he knows every snare every temptation
[49:47] and he gives a commandment now notice
[49:49] god says this god says this to he tells
[49:51] the same thing to abraham now here's
[49:54] abraham who we're going to get to just
[49:55] for a moment a man who the bible says
[49:58] was living in a strange country
[50:01] surrounded by uh some of the greatest
[50:04] nations in in history
[50:06] and not knowing where he's going not
[50:09] knowing where he's even what he's going
[50:11] to face he doesn't know the challenge
[50:13] that's going to await him tomorrow all
[50:15] god said was get up and leave
[50:18] and he says and i'm going to give you a
[50:20] promise abraham i'm going to promise you
[50:23] that that i'll bless you that your seed
[50:26] shall possess the gate of his enemies
[50:29] and here was abraham who was traveling
[50:31] through a a strange country what is that
[50:34] word what does it mean when it says it
[50:36] was strange i'm sure there was a lot of
[50:38] weirdos in that country but but really
[50:40] what it means is is that he didn't know
[50:43] he had never seen it before it was
[50:45] strange unto him he had never passed
[50:47] that way before it wasn't like a
[50:49] destination that he had taken a journey
[50:51] that way but it was a strange country
[50:54] and the bible says he faced uh
[50:57] not knowing even what he would face yet
[50:59] notice in genesis 15 brother josh
[51:01] genesis 15 just get be ready um
[51:05] have your trigger finger ready here
[51:08] because i'm gonna i'm gonna say a lot of
[51:09] these so genesis 15 verse one notice
[51:12] what god tells abraham
[51:15] after these things the word of the lord
[51:16] came unto american division saying
[51:22] you can say it it's okay
[51:24] what was the first thing the lord tells
[51:26] abraham go get up get out of here lord
[51:29] it's a strange country i don't even know
[51:30] where to go i don't know what i'm going
[51:32] to do how am i going to live how am i
[51:34] going to eat where am i going to sleep
[51:35] what kind of
[51:36] problems will i face tomorrow how will i
[51:39] ever make it god says just go abraham
[51:41] and he says the word of the lord came to
[51:43] him with a vision say in the very first
[51:45] words he says to abraham fear not
[51:48] abraham
[51:49] you say why lord why wouldn't i fear
[51:51] because i am thy shield
[51:53] and thy exceeding great reward
[51:57] i'm not just going to send an angel i'm
[51:59] not going to send a friend i'm not going
[52:00] to send another king from another nation
[52:03] to protect you i want you to know
[52:05] abraham you can have confidence not to
[52:07] fear the devil because i'm going to be
[52:10] your shield
[52:11] [Applause]
[52:13] hallelujah i'm thy shield i am thy
[52:16] exceeding great reward
[52:20] notice what he says i am thy shield that
[52:23] word shield means a wall
[52:26] that's what it means
[52:28] i am thy
[52:29] shield a wall i own a wall all around
[52:33] you
[52:34] glory
[52:36] it means a fortress that's what god was
[52:39] saying a fortress that word shield
[52:42] wasn't just a shield like you would have
[52:44] given night but it actually is a more
[52:46] richer meaning than that god says i am
[52:49] the wall that will surround you and
[52:51] protect you from all of your enemies and
[52:54] all of your foes
[52:56] i'll be your defense you know what god
[52:59] was saying abraham you're going to face
[53:01] challenges you're going to face
[53:03] difficulties but i'll be your wall i'll
[53:06] be your defender i'll be your protector
[53:09] can somebody say amen here tonight
[53:11] you know what abraham
[53:13] you know how abraham responded to that
[53:17] he believed
[53:18] amen
[53:21] let me give you abraham's response to
[53:22] god he believed
[53:26] he was a believer amen and you know what
[53:28] a believer does i believe he believes
[53:32] you know what a believer is made to do
[53:34] he's born to do he's anointed to do
[53:37] his seed gene that's down inside of him
[53:40] is is the purpose of a seed of abraham
[53:43] what was down inside of him it was to
[53:45] believe the word of god
[53:48] to accept the word of god to say i
[53:50] believe it lord do you understand to
[53:52] abraham no
[53:55] do you do do you does everything make
[53:57] sense to you no
[53:59] did god explain everything no
[54:03] did god give you the answer to all of
[54:05] your questions no
[54:07] but i
[54:08] believe hallelujah but i believe
[54:12] abraham's response to god was i believe
[54:15] lord he believed in the lord the bible
[54:17] says in hebrews he believed and it was
[54:19] accounted unto him for righteousness
[54:23] because why righteousness comes by
[54:26] believing the word of god notice god
[54:28] gives the same exact promise to his son
[54:31] isaac who isaac lived in a very uh a
[54:35] fearful land and a very hostile
[54:37] environment he was surrounded by
[54:39] philistines and every time isaac would
[54:41] try to dig a well they would bury
[54:43] isaac's whale and he'd try to dig
[54:45] another well they wanted him out of
[54:47] there they harassed him they wanted him
[54:49] out of his promised land and they tried
[54:51] to push him out of his promised land let
[54:53] me tell you something friends every day
[54:56] that every for every minute that you're
[54:58] in your promise
[55:00] satan will try to harass you out of it
[55:02] for every minute that you're standing in
[55:05] the holy spirit knowing where you stand
[55:07] as a believer in your promised land the
[55:09] devil will try to kick you out of there
[55:11] he'll try to do anything he can to push
[55:13] you off of what god has revealed to you
[55:16] amen
[55:17] but you know what isaac did isaac just
[55:18] stood his ground and believed the word
[55:20] of god amen
[55:21] notice isaac was
[55:24] was was surrounded
[55:26] by trouble the bible says as i said
[55:29] every time that he tried to dig a well
[55:32] uh and we don't have time to read it who
[55:34] would says where was he gonna get his
[55:35] water from the the well
[55:37] but every single time he tried
[55:39] to dig a well the philistines would come
[55:42] to bury it you ever felt like
[55:44] that you went through so much labor and
[55:46] so much effort for something only for
[55:48] the devil just to come and fill it all
[55:50] back in
[55:52] you know how
[55:53] tiring that must have been i'll give you
[55:55] another word you know how discouraging
[55:57] that must have been
[55:59] for every time he tried to to to to
[56:02] labor in something to dig a well
[56:05] back then drilling machines he was
[56:07] digging it literally digging it
[56:09] by hand
[56:11] and that the bible says that the
[56:12] philistines would fill it back up the
[56:14] philistines had stopped them and filled
[56:17] them with the earth
[56:18] the scripture says
[56:20] every time everywhere isaac went he
[56:22] traveled from that city to another city
[56:24] and he faced the same exact problem
[56:27] he calls over the bible says even called
[56:29] one well esac which means contention
[56:32] because that's what he was represented
[56:34] this is a land of contention there's
[56:37] constantly contention i get one word
[56:39] from that word contention
[56:43] all tension and if i can say anything
[56:45] about living in 2021 i got one word
[56:47] that's a good description tension
[56:50] amen
[56:51] am i preaching to anybody who could
[56:53] identify
[56:54] tension everything in this world
[56:57] is
[56:58] tension
[57:00] and it caused great discouragement no
[57:02] doubt
[57:03] to isaac even as hell he's trying to
[57:05] raise his children in a land of tension
[57:08] of contention he's trying to raise a
[57:10] family in a land of contention he's
[57:13] trying to provide for his own children
[57:16] by digging whales it was really going to
[57:17] be their water source
[57:19] and no doubt
[57:21] isaac could
[57:22] can name it that because every time that
[57:25] he tried to to do something to dig a
[57:27] well the philistines came in
[57:29] and they would just bury it and you know
[57:31] isaac could say god why did you have me
[57:33] move here god why don't you help me
[57:35] build a house here if it's just going to
[57:37] be trouble if it's just going to be
[57:38] contention and tension the whole time
[57:40] lord why are you even having me do this
[57:42] how am i ever going to make it and do
[57:44] you even have a plan for my life
[57:46] you ever felt that way
[57:48] oh i could i could see a great gloomy
[57:51] cloud coming over isaac i want you to
[57:54] notice what he says here in genesis 26
[57:56] brother uh
[57:58] josh
[57:59] verse 15.
[58:00] i want you just to read this for a
[58:01] second
[58:02] notice what he says here and for all of
[58:04] his whales which is father servants that
[58:06] dig in the days of abraham's father
[58:07] philistines and stop them filled them
[58:09] with earth no doubt isaac was all
[58:12] troubled on every side how am i going to
[58:14] make it lord what am i going to do uh
[58:16] lord i i don't why did you even bring me
[58:19] here why am i planted here if it's
[58:21] always going to be tension you know what
[58:23] god answers him in verse 24 and notice
[58:26] what god says to isaac abraham's son in
[58:29] verse 24 and the lord appeared unto him
[58:32] the same night and said i am the god of
[58:36] abraham thy father fear not for i am
[58:40] with thee and i will bless thee and i
[58:43] will multiply thy seed for my servant
[58:46] abraham's sake in other words isaac you
[58:49] don't need to fear because the same
[58:51] promise that i gave your father is also
[58:54] an anointing upon your life and the same
[58:56] promise i gave him that i'll be a wall
[58:59] around him i'll protect him i'll deliver
[59:01] him is the same promise i'm giving you
[59:04] isaac let me just fast forward beyond
[59:07] abraham and isaac and come to you
[59:09] tonight god says the same promise that i
[59:12] gave abraham and i gave to his son isaac
[59:15] has been transferred by faith to your
[59:18] children to your family to your
[59:21] situation to your problem i am thy wall
[59:26] of defense amen
[59:28] amen
[59:29] saber the matter i'm a seed of abraham
[59:31] look at galatians 3 verse 29 i love this
[59:34] notice what it says here in galatians 3
[59:37] verse 29 brother josh aldis wait for
[59:40] that good he says and if you be christ
[59:43] how many can say i'm christ
[59:46] then you
[59:47] then are you
[59:49] abraham's seed
[59:52] see how am i abraham's you ever asked
[59:54] that question i believe
[59:56] i'm i'm you know we're called father
[59:58] abraham had many sons and many sons had
[1:00:00] father how am i connected to abraham
[1:00:02] here's how
[1:00:03] galatians 6 because galatians 3 because
[1:00:06] who was abraham's notice it doesn't say
[1:00:08] to thy seeds
[1:00:10] plural
[1:00:12] but it says unto he told abraham unto
[1:00:14] thy
[1:00:15] seed
[1:00:17] and who was abraham's seed
[1:00:19] christ
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:22] so paul says and if you be christ's
[1:00:26] i can put a check mark there and say yes
[1:00:28] that's me
[1:00:30] then you are
[1:00:33] by transferred promise
[1:00:36] abraham's seed
[1:00:38] and further than his seed you are heirs
[1:00:43] you know what it means to be an heir
[1:00:47] you're an heir according to the promise
[1:00:51] amen according to what promise the same
[1:00:53] promise he promised abraham has now been
[1:00:56] transferred
[1:00:58] to me
[1:00:59] i just want to stop and say thank you
[1:01:01] lord for that
[1:01:04] you say brother matt why is that so
[1:01:05] special because if i'm abraham's seed
[1:01:08] then the same god who was a shield to
[1:01:10] abraham in his greatest difficulty is
[1:01:13] still the same shield to me as a
[1:01:15] believer the same promise that he
[1:01:18] promised abraham that i'll protect you
[1:01:20] and i'll defend you is the same promise
[1:01:22] to me as a believer
[1:01:26] listen to what brother adam says here
[1:01:27] and i don't didn't want to take too much
[1:01:29] time i don't see the remote
[1:01:31] up here brothers for that you can
[1:01:33] control it that's just fine put that
[1:01:35] power point up listen to what brother
[1:01:37] branham says i don't want to miss these
[1:01:39] it's just too good to miss notice he
[1:01:40] says in confirmation and evidence the
[1:01:42] powerpoint that we had you have to close
[1:01:45] okay you got that
[1:01:46] notice now faith
[1:01:48] god told abraham here give him a promise
[1:01:54] and then god confirmed this promise to
[1:01:58] him let me pull up my mind because it's
[1:02:00] it's i got a notation in here let me
[1:02:02] just make sure i have it right he says
[1:02:04] now faith god told abraham gave him a
[1:02:06] promise and then god confirmed this
[1:02:08] promise to him
[1:02:10] give him an evidence
[1:02:13] by taking an oath before him
[1:02:17] genesis chapter 22
[1:02:20] if you have your bible i just i i want
[1:02:22] you to turn to there just quickly if you
[1:02:24] could genesis chapter 22
[1:02:28] i want you to look at this because it's
[1:02:30] it's important to understand what
[1:02:31] brother animal is even saying here
[1:02:34] because he says he confirmed to him
[1:02:36] by taking an oath before him genesis 22
[1:02:40] verse 15. start at verse 15. you got
[1:02:42] your bible
[1:02:44] and the angel of the lord called unto
[1:02:46] abraham out of heaven the second time
[1:02:49] and said by myself
[1:02:52] have i sworn saith the lord for because
[1:02:56] thou has done this thing
[1:02:58] and is not withheld thy son thy only son
[1:03:01] that in blessing i will bless thee and
[1:03:04] in multiplying i will multiply thy seed
[1:03:07] as the stars of the heaven and as the
[1:03:10] sandwiches upon the seashore and thy
[1:03:13] seed shall possess the gate of his
[1:03:15] enemies and in thy seed shall all the
[1:03:19] nations of the earth be blessed because
[1:03:22] thou has obeyed my
[1:03:25] voice
[1:03:26] what does brother madam say here and
[1:03:28] notice in the powerpoint he says god
[1:03:30] made an oath to him there was abraham
[1:03:33] here was god himself making a promise
[1:03:37] god says i swear that's a powerful word
[1:03:41] it's a powerful word
[1:03:43] so such a reverence to that word
[1:03:46] there should be
[1:03:49] as i swear
[1:03:51] you know we teach our children don't
[1:03:52] swear don't don't don't say that you
[1:03:54] know why
[1:03:56] because there's such a there's such a
[1:03:59] what word am i looking for there's a
[1:04:01] sacredness
[1:04:03] there should be
[1:04:04] when you swear by your word
[1:04:08] and when you give an oath to something
[1:04:11] and god doesn't do this in many places
[1:04:13] you read about in the bible
[1:04:14] in fact this is one of the only one of
[1:04:16] the first and one of the only times
[1:04:19] you'll find god
[1:04:21] swearing something
[1:04:23] and making a promise
[1:04:26] making an oath listen to what brother
[1:04:28] branham says here and he says
[1:04:30] to give him an evidence
[1:04:33] by taking an oath before him
[1:04:36] if you have that powerpoint
[1:04:38] and the immutable thing load notice
[1:04:41] and the immutable thing
[1:04:45] is that god cannot lie
[1:04:49] do you know now why it's so special when
[1:04:52] god swears something
[1:04:54] may not mean anything to you if i swear
[1:04:57] to you that i'll be at your house to
[1:04:58] help you tomorrow or i'll be there if
[1:05:01] you ever need me i swear that may
[1:05:03] may mean nothing to you at all
[1:05:06] but when you know why because i could
[1:05:07] lie
[1:05:09] and i could fail to keep my word
[1:05:11] but when god swears and when god makes a
[1:05:14] promise
[1:05:16] he swore by himself not by any person
[1:05:19] not by any condition but he swore by
[1:05:22] himself and brother branham says he says
[1:05:24] and the immutable thing is that god
[1:05:26] cannot lie
[1:05:28] it's not even possible
[1:05:32] and not only that when he promised
[1:05:34] notice and not only that when he
[1:05:36] promised him then beyond that
[1:05:38] he swore to it
[1:05:40] god
[1:05:41] taking an oath
[1:05:44] to himself
[1:05:46] say brother matt why is that important
[1:05:47] to me because you're a child of abe
[1:05:49] you're you're a seed of abraham
[1:05:51] not a natural seed you're a spiritual
[1:05:53] seed
[1:05:54] and if that's the case then the same
[1:05:56] promise the same immutability
[1:05:59] that god cannot lie applies to you and
[1:06:03] to me
[1:06:04] glory
[1:06:07] god's confirming his own word
[1:06:09] that he swore by an oath he says i swear
[1:06:12] unto you
[1:06:13] brother adam says god taken an oath
[1:06:16] to himself listen go on to the next
[1:06:19] slide this is what brother adam says
[1:06:21] here you've got to swear to someone
[1:06:23] greater than you
[1:06:25] and there was no one to swear to greater
[1:06:28] than himself so he swore to himself
[1:06:33] and the promise was unto abraham and is
[1:06:35] a conjunction notice and as a
[1:06:37] conjunction
[1:06:38] to his seed not just abraham but to your
[1:06:42] seed after you in other words when god
[1:06:44] had this thought in his mind that i'm
[1:06:46] gonna make a promise here i'm gonna
[1:06:48] swear by an oath god wasn't just looking
[1:06:50] at one man named abraham but god was
[1:06:53] looking at the entire line of abraham to
[1:06:56] every seed that would come after him i'm
[1:06:58] making an immutable promise abraham
[1:07:02] to every seed of abraham
[1:07:06] and all you have to do
[1:07:08] is believe yes
[1:07:11] you realize that all you have to do to
[1:07:13] claim abraham's promises is simply by
[1:07:17] faith believe them amen
[1:07:20] and it does so much to god when you
[1:07:22] believe his word
[1:07:24] brother branham says when you believe
[1:07:26] his word he says it makes him want to
[1:07:28] give you whatever you ask for
[1:07:32] that's what brother adam says he says it
[1:07:33] makes him love you and want to give you
[1:07:36] whatever you ask for why doing what
[1:07:38] brother man just believe in his word
[1:07:41] it means so much to god because at heart
[1:07:44] it is so it hurts the lord so much when
[1:07:48] we doubt his word
[1:07:50] and it means so much to him when we
[1:07:52] believe his word
[1:07:54] i say lord
[1:07:55] don't let me doubt your word lord let me
[1:07:57] believe your word amen
[1:08:00] notice this here and he says and he
[1:08:02] swore to himself and his seed after him
[1:08:04] not seeds but his seed and christ is the
[1:08:08] seed of abraham and we be it in christ
[1:08:11] the life of christ in us makes us
[1:08:14] abraham's children
[1:08:16] and our heirs with him according to
[1:08:20] the promise
[1:08:21] according to my word according to my
[1:08:24] conde my behavior no it's not based on
[1:08:27] my behavior according if i
[1:08:29] what i can do and what i can't do god
[1:08:31] says i'm not gonna make it based upon
[1:08:33] you i'm not gonna put it upon you
[1:08:35] whether you fail or you get up tomorrow
[1:08:38] or you stay down i'm going to swear by
[1:08:40] myself so that no matter what you do
[1:08:44] my promise still stands
[1:08:47] you love him for that
[1:08:50] notice hebrews 6 and don't don't take it
[1:08:52] down don't take it down everyone has a
[1:08:54] bible just turn in your bible quickly
[1:08:56] hebrews chapter 6 if you don't get there
[1:08:58] then then just stop trying to turn and
[1:09:00] just just listen along i'm going to give
[1:09:02] you just a minute hebrews chapter 6
[1:09:04] so powerful here
[1:09:06] and he says in hebrews 6 verse 17
[1:09:10] so when god
[1:09:12] notice
[1:09:13] so when god i want to i want you i want
[1:09:16] you to realize put if you could put that
[1:09:18] on the screen i'm sorry to go back and
[1:09:19] forth brother josh hebrews 6 verse 17
[1:09:22] and i just realized now why i wanted to
[1:09:24] have that up because i want to i want to
[1:09:25] read this to you from the king james
[1:09:27] that i want to read it to you from a
[1:09:28] different translation notice hebrews 6
[1:09:31] verse 17
[1:09:33] wherein god
[1:09:36] wherein god willing
[1:09:39] willing
[1:09:40] what does that mean
[1:09:42] he's desiring
[1:09:44] it's his will
[1:09:45] he wants to do this
[1:09:48] this isn't something that you even had
[1:09:50] to ask him to do but paul says wherein
[1:09:53] god wanting
[1:09:55] willing desiring more abundantly
[1:09:59] to show unto the heirs of promise are
[1:10:03] you an heir of the promise
[1:10:05] the immutability of his counsel
[1:10:08] confirmed it by an oath
[1:10:11] what is that saying it's saying that he
[1:10:14] didn't even have to swear
[1:10:17] he never had to there was no one forcing
[1:10:20] him to god had no he didn't have any
[1:10:22] obligation
[1:10:24] to swear it he could have just said it
[1:10:26] and required you to believe it amen
[1:10:29] notice why hebrews 6 verse 17 listen
[1:10:31] here
[1:10:32] so when god desired
[1:10:35] to show more convincingly
[1:10:38] to the heirs of the promise the
[1:10:41] unchangeable character of his purpose
[1:10:47] so when god had a desire
[1:10:50] and he wanted
[1:10:51] what is what was you say brother matt
[1:10:53] wise why are you getting so excited over
[1:10:54] this because i see it
[1:10:56] that god says i had a desire i want to
[1:10:59] convince you i want to make sure i want
[1:11:02] it i don't have to do this but i'm going
[1:11:04] to do something to show you the
[1:11:08] unchangeable character of my purpose
[1:11:12] to show you how
[1:11:14] positive sure
[1:11:16] that that i am
[1:11:18] i'm going to swear it
[1:11:21] by an oath
[1:11:24] you know what hebrews you go through
[1:11:25] this entire book of hebrews and you read
[1:11:27] all of hebrews 6.
[1:11:29] what is it it's god
[1:11:31] encouraging you you can believe this
[1:11:35] you can trust this
[1:11:37] you don't have to doubt this
[1:11:39] you can believe it by and you can have
[1:11:41] faith so that you could receive why lord
[1:11:44] why would you do that because worse than
[1:11:46] you want
[1:11:48] to obtain the promise that god has given
[1:11:50] god wants you to obtain that promise
[1:11:54] more than you want to say lord i want to
[1:11:56] believe what you've promised god wants
[1:11:58] you so bad to believe what he's promised
[1:12:02] and he says i'm going to encourage you
[1:12:05] in your faith and so what does god do he
[1:12:08] goes to abraham here in verse 15.
[1:12:10] go go back to verse 15 brother josh in
[1:12:13] hebrews 6 for men barely swear
[1:12:16] for and and so after he had patiently
[1:12:18] introduced him pointing to abraham and
[1:12:21] so after he had patiently endured
[1:12:24] he obtained
[1:12:26] the promise
[1:12:28] god wasn't content
[1:12:31] not he god wasn't content just to offer
[1:12:35] a promise
[1:12:36] to abraham and to abraham's seed and
[1:12:39] also his descendants but god wasn't
[1:12:41] satisfied just to offer a promise but he
[1:12:43] said i want to confirm it right now
[1:12:46] i want to swear by it
[1:12:48] i want to put my own word there
[1:12:50] say why lord so that you can have faith
[1:12:53] so that you can believe it so that you
[1:12:56] can claim it i'm going to swear by
[1:13:00] an oath
[1:13:01] men's words
[1:13:03] can can change men's words can men's
[1:13:06] character one day he thinks this and the
[1:13:08] next day he believes this and one day
[1:13:10] he's up and one day he's down
[1:13:12] but god says but so i'm not going to
[1:13:14] swear by any man i'm not going to make
[1:13:16] it a promise that's connected to any
[1:13:18] person or any ernie or any condition
[1:13:23] but i'm going to swear it
[1:13:25] to myself i don't have to because you
[1:13:27] say brother matt why does it have to be
[1:13:28] because the bible says that in god is
[1:13:30] light there's no darkness at all there's
[1:13:32] no chance in fact the bible says it's
[1:13:34] impossible for him to even lie
[1:13:36] but i but just just because i want to
[1:13:40] convince you i have a desire to to to
[1:13:43] anchor it in your soul i'm going to
[1:13:45] swear by
[1:13:47] an oath he desired i love this
[1:13:49] translation he desired to show more
[1:13:53] convince convincingly the immutability
[1:13:56] of his character of his purpose to all
[1:13:59] the children of god this is why
[1:14:02] he promised it
[1:14:04] you know why because it's part of you
[1:14:06] you're in your nature it's part of your
[1:14:09] sinful nature to doubt
[1:14:13] do you realize that that it's too that
[1:14:15] it did in every person
[1:14:17] all of us me included all of us there's
[1:14:19] something that's in our makeup something
[1:14:22] that's in our d our human dna our human
[1:14:25] structure our human the way that the the
[1:14:28] that we're made in sin born in sin
[1:14:31] shaped an iniquity there's a propensity
[1:14:34] for us not to believe his word not to
[1:14:37] believe the impossible not to believe
[1:14:39] what we can't see it's oh sure we can
[1:14:42] believe anything that we that's why we
[1:14:44] we need to see it to believe it god
[1:14:47] needs to sometimes perform it before our
[1:14:49] own eyes before we'll finally say ah now
[1:14:52] i believe it
[1:14:54] because it's not in you naturally it's
[1:14:56] in you as a christian it's in you to
[1:14:59] doubt the word of god it's in you to not
[1:15:02] believe what you can't see it's in you
[1:15:05] to the things the promises of god that
[1:15:07] you haven't realized yet it's natural in
[1:15:10] your sinful condition to say i just
[1:15:13] don't know lord
[1:15:15] i'm just not sure god do you know that's
[1:15:18] natural for you to doubt
[1:15:22] thomas was a doubter too
[1:15:25] here here was the bible tells the story
[1:15:27] of thomas that that that you know after
[1:15:30] even after all of the disciples had
[1:15:32] witnessed and told him about the
[1:15:34] resurrected christ and how they had how
[1:15:36] they thomas still the bible says the
[1:15:38] bible says thomas still doubted still
[1:15:41] still doubted what the what what the
[1:15:44] that he had risen
[1:15:45] you imagine
[1:15:47] here's here's all of the disciples and
[1:15:49] here's all of the believers rejoicing
[1:15:52] and excited and testifying
[1:15:55] and here's one person who just can't
[1:15:56] believe
[1:15:58] now it was easy for them to believe
[1:16:00] because they had seen him
[1:16:02] thomas had it yet you know what the
[1:16:03] bible says that jesus appeared unto them
[1:16:06] and here was thomas the doubter thomas
[1:16:08] always questioning and the bible says
[1:16:11] that jesus appears
[1:16:13] and you know what the lord doesn't begin
[1:16:15] to hug all of his disciples and they
[1:16:18] begin to embrace and they're beginning
[1:16:20] to rejoice and beginning to shout you
[1:16:22] could see thomas over there in the
[1:16:23] corner you know trying to get the you
[1:16:26] know the matter out of his eyes am i
[1:16:28] really seeing this
[1:16:30] and jesus is over there hugging and and
[1:16:32] they're all embracing they're all
[1:16:34] rejoicing and they're all testifying and
[1:16:37] you know as jesus hugs peter
[1:16:40] he glares over thomas
[1:16:44] as he's pat and peter on the back
[1:16:50] oh peter i mean old thomas
[1:16:53] really
[1:16:54] after all
[1:16:56] you wouldn't believe
[1:16:57] you're sitting there in doubt not
[1:16:59] believing you know what pete you know
[1:17:00] what thomas had said thomas had said i
[1:17:02] won't believe
[1:17:04] unless i touch his hands
[1:17:06] and i can feel the nail scarred if i can
[1:17:08] put my put my hands in his hand he said
[1:17:10] unless i could touch his own hands i
[1:17:12] wouldn't believe you know what jesus
[1:17:14] does jesus doesn't glare at him he
[1:17:16] doesn't even rebuke him as he does many
[1:17:19] times before the resurrection he'd
[1:17:20] rebuke them then he'd speak to the storm
[1:17:23] but he never rebukes thomas he walks
[1:17:25] over to thomas and says here thomas
[1:17:28] here's my hands touch them
[1:17:31] is that what helps you to believe thomas
[1:17:34] whatever helps you whatever brings and
[1:17:36] raises your faith
[1:17:38] brother branham said this he said james
[1:17:40] says lay your hands upon the sick and
[1:17:42] they shall recover and every person asks
[1:17:44] brother random says brother brandon but
[1:17:45] the a real gentile faith is it's just to
[1:17:48] believe we shouldn't have to have our
[1:17:49] hands laid on us brother adam says
[1:17:51] that's true he says real gentile faith
[1:17:53] he says but god will meet you he'll
[1:17:55] condemn to you at whatever level you're
[1:17:59] at god will condemn send himself down to
[1:18:02] you and say if this is what you need in
[1:18:04] order to believe i'll do it for you
[1:18:07] because i want you to believe my word
[1:18:10] and never doubt my word so i'll reveal
[1:18:13] myself to you at whatever level you can
[1:18:15] give me
[1:18:17] i'm glad that's the kind of savior
[1:18:19] glad that's the kind of father i'm glad
[1:18:21] that's my creator he doesn't kick me
[1:18:24] aside when i doubt his word or i'm
[1:18:26] having trouble believing or i'm having
[1:18:28] trouble obtaining but he says i'll
[1:18:30] condemn sin down to your level
[1:18:32] and i'll meet you at whatever faith you
[1:18:34] can give me
[1:18:37] and brother adam says even if it means
[1:18:38] laying he says if that's what it takes
[1:18:40] for delay or an elder or minister to lay
[1:18:43] his hands upon you said god doesn't
[1:18:44] dishonor that god honors that because he
[1:18:46] sees that's what level of faith that you
[1:18:48] have
[1:18:52] hallelujah i said hallelujah
[1:18:56] what does it mean god is swearing
[1:18:59] he's saying to he's saying
[1:19:01] it doesn't it doesn't matter instead of
[1:19:03] leaving you in your doubt instead of
[1:19:05] just kicking you over to the side but in
[1:19:08] mercy and in love god promises and
[1:19:11] swears to us
[1:19:13] i swear by myself
[1:19:18] and god says and i got a promise for you
[1:19:20] abraham
[1:19:21] and it transcends you and your natural
[1:19:23] seed it's going to carry over to christ
[1:19:26] because christ is my is the see is he is
[1:19:28] the seed
[1:19:29] and whoever is in christ is a seed of
[1:19:32] abraham
[1:19:34] listen what brother adam says i'm not
[1:19:35] going to be too much longer here listen
[1:19:37] to what brother adam says he says he
[1:19:39] says when he promised him then beyond
[1:19:40] that he swore
[1:19:42] he says he says in christ in the seat of
[1:19:44] abraham let's go to the fourth slide all
[1:19:46] i want you to notice that this promise
[1:19:47] that god made abraham wasn't only just
[1:19:51] to abraham but it was to his seed
[1:19:54] after him
[1:19:56] now many people says oh if if i'd been
[1:19:58] like abraham if i would have have been
[1:20:00] where god had talked to me and give me
[1:20:03] the assurance like he did abraham then i
[1:20:05] would have i would really have faith
[1:20:07] brother branham if i just had brother
[1:20:10] madam says if god had talked to me
[1:20:13] he's still quoting this here a person
[1:20:15] saying this if god had talked to me like
[1:20:17] you did abraham brotherhood stops but
[1:20:20] you have the same promise that abraham
[1:20:22] had
[1:20:24] if you're a seed of abraham
[1:20:27] he says then you say brother brother
[1:20:28] branham i'm a gentile go to the next
[1:20:30] slide you say brother burnham but i'm a
[1:20:32] gentile i could i could not have the
[1:20:35] seed of abraham the seed of abraham
[1:20:38] wasn't the natural seed it was the
[1:20:41] spiritual seed
[1:20:43] for the circumcision of that was nothing
[1:20:46] he says for the circumstances that was
[1:20:47] nothing the promise he even give him
[1:20:50] before circumcision but it was given to
[1:20:53] him before circumcision and it wasn't
[1:20:55] because he was circumcised and in the
[1:20:57] covenant with god that way it's because
[1:20:59] that abraham
[1:21:01] believed
[1:21:03] god
[1:21:06] it wasn't because of his circumcision it
[1:21:08] wasn't because of all of his obedience
[1:21:10] lord why'd you swear to him because he
[1:21:12] believed me
[1:21:14] because there was something in abraham
[1:21:16] that believed me
[1:21:18] you know how important it is
[1:21:20] for my children to believe my word
[1:21:25] does your word mean anything to you amen
[1:21:28] means something to you doesn't it as a
[1:21:30] christian
[1:21:31] as a man i'll speak to to to all
[1:21:34] believers here but especially to men or
[1:21:36] something about the word
[1:21:38] your word means something
[1:21:40] you know it discourages you when someone
[1:21:43] doubts your word
[1:21:45] especially those who you love
[1:21:47] and you make a promise to you you
[1:21:49] promise you promise
[1:21:51] something to someone who you love and
[1:21:53] you tell them i'm gonna you can you know
[1:21:55] i'm going to be there i'll be there to
[1:21:57] help you and you you can count on me
[1:21:59] you know what it bothers you when you
[1:22:01] get a text later you know
[1:22:03] or just making sure you're still coming
[1:22:05] it's like didn't i say i didn't i say i
[1:22:07] was
[1:22:08] does my word mean nothing have i done
[1:22:10] anything to
[1:22:11] to to to make you doubt my character
[1:22:13] that when i promise something you know
[1:22:15] why because it means something to you
[1:22:17] when you make a promise anybody feel
[1:22:19] that way
[1:22:21] when you say something i'm not talking
[1:22:22] about when you frivolously say it i'm
[1:22:24] saying when you really put your name
[1:22:26] behind something and you you make a
[1:22:28] promise to it you want it it pleases you
[1:22:33] when when those who you love believe
[1:22:35] what you say
[1:22:37] and let me just say if you how much more
[1:22:40] the lord jesus
[1:22:42] when he says something in his word how
[1:22:44] much it must do how much it must hurt
[1:22:47] him
[1:22:48] when we question that word
[1:22:50] or when we doubt that word
[1:22:53] or that when we have trouble believing
[1:22:54] it but brother how much it must bless
[1:22:56] him
[1:22:57] when we really by faith and i just want
[1:23:00] to say lord i believe your word
[1:23:03] i want to by faith believe your word and
[1:23:05] accept what you've said
[1:23:07] without doubting without questioning
[1:23:10] without wondering
[1:23:13] i want to believe your word
[1:23:15] scripture says that when we are dead and
[1:23:17] notice the next one scripture says that
[1:23:19] when we are dead in christ we become
[1:23:21] abraham's seed paul speaks of it and
[1:23:24] that which is jew is not jew outwardly
[1:23:26] but jew inwardly therefore
[1:23:29] if you are born of the spirit of god you
[1:23:31] are abraham's seed and our heirs with
[1:23:34] abraham according to the promise
[1:23:36] therefore every promise that god gave
[1:23:38] abraham is yours somebody say it tonight
[1:23:41] it's mine
[1:23:43] he says every promise that he gave
[1:23:44] abraham is yours because spiritually you
[1:23:47] are abraham's seed now but when you have
[1:23:50] separated yourself from the things of
[1:23:52] the world next slide
[1:23:54] crossed over that separating line
[1:23:57] and are so journeyed in a strange land
[1:24:00] a land like you wasn't in how many are
[1:24:04] sojourning in a land
[1:24:06] like i wasn't in am i in my sin i'm not
[1:24:08] there anymore
[1:24:09] i'm so journey and i'm not i'm you say
[1:24:11] brother matt you're still in the states
[1:24:12] you didn't move out of the country no i
[1:24:14] didn't i didn't move out of the country
[1:24:16] when i gave my heart to the lord but i
[1:24:18] very much moved out of this cosmos and
[1:24:21] this worldly system
[1:24:23] i'm not sojourning in that land anymore
[1:24:25] i'm a pilgrim and a stranger
[1:24:28] in the beginning notice here with a
[1:24:31] people that you never associated with in
[1:24:33] the beginning then you become no no go
[1:24:36] back
[1:24:38] and he says in the beginning with the
[1:24:40] people that you never associated with in
[1:24:42] the beginning then you become a
[1:24:45] spiritual jew
[1:24:49] you say brother man what are you tonight
[1:24:50] i'm a jew by faith i'm a spiritual jew
[1:24:54] how because i left the other thing i
[1:24:57] heard from my theophany i left the world
[1:25:00] in the worldly systems and i'm so
[1:25:02] journeying to a better country a better
[1:25:04] home a better life a better land
[1:25:09] one who's builder and maker is god not
[1:25:11] this one the next one
[1:25:14] because the same way that abraham by
[1:25:16] faith left his country left his people
[1:25:19] went into a strange land with strange
[1:25:22] people next slide
[1:25:25] he says you have left your people
[1:25:30] speaking to christians
[1:25:32] hello
[1:25:34] you left your people
[1:25:36] left the world behind
[1:25:38] left your associates behind
[1:25:42] crossed over through the blood of jesus
[1:25:44] christ
[1:25:45] and are sojourners
[1:25:49] seeking for a city whose builder and
[1:25:51] maker is god like abraham was
[1:25:55] pilgrims along with him dwelling in
[1:25:57] tents churches
[1:25:59] fellow citizens of the kingdom of heaven
[1:26:02] heirs of all things through jesus christ
[1:26:06] we have crossed
[1:26:08] over
[1:26:09] separated amen
[1:26:12] separated
[1:26:13] just as israel you can you can end that
[1:26:16] there brother josh
[1:26:17] just as israel
[1:26:19] separated just as abraham left his
[1:26:22] country you think of of all of abraham's
[1:26:25] seed
[1:26:26] think of israel as they left and they
[1:26:28] crossed over
[1:26:29] into the promised land what were they
[1:26:31] they were a seed of faith they were born
[1:26:34] to believe they were born to believe the
[1:26:36] word of god listen friends the real true
[1:26:39] faith
[1:26:40] the abraham's kind of faith
[1:26:43] was abraham believed god before it came
[1:26:46] to pass
[1:26:48] i said abraham believed god
[1:26:51] before it ever manifested
[1:26:54] are you a believer here tonight
[1:26:56] you say why are you believer is it
[1:26:58] because of because you've seen god and
[1:27:00] he's promised he's kept his own word it
[1:27:02] started way before that even before i
[1:27:05] seen it
[1:27:06] i believed it
[1:27:08] before it was manifested i believed it
[1:27:12] and tonight before i see the promise
[1:27:14] come to pass i want to let you know lord
[1:27:17] i believe it
[1:27:19] long before a real believer real
[1:27:21] abraham's faith real true seed faith of
[1:27:24] abraham
[1:27:26] is a faith that believes before the
[1:27:28] promise
[1:27:29] shadrach meshach and abednego didn't
[1:27:31] wait to get into the fire and see the
[1:27:34] fourth man before they believed if they
[1:27:36] had they would have never seen the
[1:27:38] fourth man
[1:27:39] but god required that before they before
[1:27:42] the fourth man appeared they first had
[1:27:45] to believe in the fourth man
[1:27:47] and before god could show up in your
[1:27:49] trial before he could show up in your
[1:27:51] fiery furnace you've got to have the
[1:27:53] same faith and say in spite of whether i
[1:27:56] see you whether i feel you whether i
[1:27:58] touch you whether i can see any promise
[1:28:00] of god coming to pass in my life before
[1:28:02] i step into the fire i believe in the
[1:28:04] fourth man i believe in a god who could
[1:28:07] show up at the very last moment when
[1:28:09] everything seemed too late god can still
[1:28:12] show up amen
[1:28:14] because that's real faith
[1:28:16] daniel had to believe in the god of
[1:28:18] jehovah long before he went into the
[1:28:21] lion's den he already believed amen
[1:28:24] are you here tonight
[1:28:27] think of it israel even even notice this
[1:28:30] here the bible says they come out of
[1:28:33] egypt with a high hand and pharaoh you
[1:28:34] know the story trapped before them uh
[1:28:37] here here they were in a in what seemed
[1:28:39] like a hopeless situation a hopeless
[1:28:42] predicament they were trapped with the
[1:28:45] red sea in front of them and mountains
[1:28:47] but pirahata forget the name of the of
[1:28:49] the two mountains but they were
[1:28:51] they were
[1:28:52] history says they were they were
[1:28:54] steep incline made out of a certain type
[1:28:57] of rock that would cut you you couldn't
[1:28:58] just walk up it they had nowhere to go
[1:29:01] the red sea in front of them pharaoh's
[1:29:03] army behind them you know the story very
[1:29:05] well
[1:29:06] it seemed like god had led them into
[1:29:07] this hopeless situation in it entrapment
[1:29:11] left is a mountain on the right is a
[1:29:13] mountain in front of me is a red sea
[1:29:15] behind me
[1:29:16] is an entire army that's upset mad angry
[1:29:19] and wants to kill me and doesn't believe
[1:29:21] in my god
[1:29:25] and here they are
[1:29:26] trapped
[1:29:27] what are they going to do
[1:29:28] and so the bible says they begin to cry
[1:29:31] and and and and begin to
[1:29:33] begin to cry unto moses
[1:29:36] you know that's very familiar story
[1:29:37] you've heard it so many times you don't
[1:29:39] hear they were crying unto god and led
[1:29:42] by the spirit of god this is this wasn't
[1:29:44] moses didn't make a wrong turn
[1:29:47] he didn't he didn't accidentally turn by
[1:29:49] the red sea but go read the story god
[1:29:52] has them turned by perihoth and the two
[1:29:54] mountains god is the one who led them to
[1:29:57] this hopeless situation
[1:30:00] and the scripture says that they had led
[1:30:02] there and had but purposely by the lord
[1:30:06] you know they were completely hopeless
[1:30:09] the bible says that they begin to panic
[1:30:12] and begin to cry out and begin to well
[1:30:14] and begin to moan i could see families
[1:30:17] and mothers who have children and
[1:30:19] fathers who have wives
[1:30:21] all of them begin to blame moses and why
[1:30:23] would god lead us out here let us we
[1:30:26] were better as slaves in israel
[1:30:29] in egypt better off as slaves they go on
[1:30:31] to say that further in the story down in
[1:30:33] the wilderness oh it'd have been better
[1:30:35] for us just to die of slaves than to
[1:30:37] come out here into this wilderness
[1:30:39] and just have our graves out here
[1:30:41] and there there they are at the red sea
[1:30:45] moses why'd you bring us out here why'd
[1:30:47] you have us leave egypt were there not
[1:30:49] enough graves in egypt that we couldn't
[1:30:51] be buried there
[1:30:54] and the bible says
[1:30:56] you have to believe just for a moment i
[1:30:58] have to think that maybe you know even
[1:31:00] moses himself you know
[1:31:04] lord
[1:31:05] what in the world
[1:31:08] here we've cut you you all after all of
[1:31:10] after all that you've done and all the
[1:31:12] signs and wonders that you've shown
[1:31:14] imagine moses the bible says that even
[1:31:17] moses began to cry
[1:31:19] and and god says in exodus 14 you don't
[1:31:21] have to turn
[1:31:23] god says moses
[1:31:26] wherefore christ thou unto me
[1:31:30] why in other words why no sympathy
[1:31:34] god don't you see that maybe you could
[1:31:35] look down and you can see from your view
[1:31:38] that got impossible and possible and
[1:31:41] impossible and impossible and we're
[1:31:43] surrounded by impossible right we're
[1:31:45] gonna die
[1:31:47] and god says why crying moses you
[1:31:50] remember the scripture
[1:31:52] why are you crying moses you know what
[1:31:54] god does
[1:31:56] god says speak
[1:31:58] why cry
[1:32:00] speak
[1:32:01] unto the children of israel that they go
[1:32:03] forward
[1:32:05] suddenly the bible says the winds begin
[1:32:07] to come moses you know the story takes
[1:32:10] his staff puts it in the red sea and the
[1:32:12] waters begin to part and here's this
[1:32:15] great miracle great miraculous sign
[1:32:19] as you can imagine how miraculous it
[1:32:21] would be this great ocean as david said
[1:32:24] stood up in like a heap just like two
[1:32:26] mounds of dirt
[1:32:28] and it just stood up before them and a
[1:32:31] pathway from that side of this of the
[1:32:34] red sea they could see clearly now to
[1:32:37] the other side of the red sea i hope you
[1:32:40] hear me here tonight they could see from
[1:32:43] this side
[1:32:46] what was this side their death their
[1:32:48] trouble their trial their destruction
[1:32:51] their problem the issue
[1:32:53] they could now see from their darkness
[1:32:55] and their impossibility they can now see
[1:32:58] all the way to the other side
[1:33:01] where there was safety and where there
[1:33:03] was peace
[1:33:05] and the bible says that now this great
[1:33:08] miracle thus saith the lord notice you
[1:33:10] don't have to turn thus the lord saved

[1:33:45] they're feeling now
[1:33:46] what a night and day difference now they
[1:33:49] went from crying thinking they were all
[1:33:51] going to die
[1:33:52] and now they're looking
[1:33:54] at the egyptians who
[1:33:56] harassed them who beat them who were
[1:33:59] coming to kill them now they're all dead
[1:34:03] and they're dead upon the seashore the
[1:34:05] scripture says next verse and israel saw
[1:34:08] the great work which the lord did upon
[1:34:11] the egyptians and the people feared the
[1:34:14] lord and believed the lord
[1:34:17] and his servant moses i want you to look
[1:34:20] very closely
[1:34:21] look it read it again and israel saw the
[1:34:24] great work which the lord did upon the

[1:34:30] and believed the lord
[1:34:32] and his servant
[1:34:35] moses
[1:34:36] they were believers
[1:34:39] they believed but when did they believe
[1:34:43] when the enemy was dead
[1:34:45] when there was no more trouble when
[1:34:47] there was no more struggle when there
[1:34:49] was no more pressure
[1:34:50] when there was no more impossibility
[1:34:53] now they're dancing and singing
[1:34:56] and the bible says notice in verse
[1:34:59] chapter 15 brother josh verse 1 and 2
[1:35:02] notice this here
[1:35:04] suddenly they break out and tambourines
[1:35:06] singing rejoicing
[1:35:09] scripture says verse 1 of chapter 15 the
[1:35:11] very next chapter then notice then
[1:35:15] then not before
[1:35:18] not when there was is not when there was
[1:35:19] egyptians
[1:35:21] you hear me tonight church
[1:35:23] not when they were about to get killed
[1:35:25] they weren't singing then they weren't
[1:35:26] dancing then they weren't rejoicing them
[1:35:29] but then
[1:35:30] after they were dead after the enemy was
[1:35:32] defeated after they were on the other
[1:35:34] side and all the egyptians were dead
[1:35:36] then they sang
[1:35:37] then saying notice then saying moses and
[1:35:40] the children of israel this song unto
[1:35:42] the lord and spake saying i will sing
[1:35:44] unto the lord for he hath to triumph
[1:35:46] gloriously the horse and his rider he
[1:35:49] hath thrown
[1:35:50] into the sea keep going the next verse
[1:35:54] verse two the lord is my strength and
[1:35:57] song and he has become my salvation he
[1:36:00] is my god was he not your salvation
[1:36:03] before was he not your strength before
[1:36:06] now he's your song
[1:36:08] now he's your victory now he's your
[1:36:10] strength now you have salvation he is my
[1:36:13] god and i will prepare him a habitation
[1:36:16] my father's god and i will exalt you i
[1:36:20] want you to notice something that maybe
[1:36:21] you've never thought about before they
[1:36:24] were singing a good song a godly song
[1:36:27] all the words were true they were
[1:36:29] shouting and saying very wonderful
[1:36:31] things things that we could read and say
[1:36:34] the lord is my strength and song he's
[1:36:36] become my salvation i could read that
[1:36:38] and say amen that's true that's good
[1:36:42] bless god he's my salvation he's became
[1:36:45] my savior but let me tell you something
[1:36:47] it was the right song but they should
[1:36:50] have been singing it on the other side
[1:36:52] of the red sea
[1:36:55] not this side of the red sea this side
[1:36:58] of the red sea the battle was over but
[1:37:00] when does faith when is faith most
[1:37:04] important when is faith when is this
[1:37:07] type of song the most important to god
[1:37:10] not after you've came out of the trial
[1:37:13] but when you're in the middle of the
[1:37:15] darkest moment of the most impossible
[1:37:17] situation of what looks hopeless then
[1:37:20] god says now sing your song of
[1:37:22] deliverance
[1:37:23] now sing your song of victory now's the
[1:37:26] time to get the tambourine when brother
[1:37:28] matt when the clouds are dark when it
[1:37:30] looks impossible when the situation is
[1:37:32] hopeless a believer believes the word in
[1:37:36] the midst of his darkest moment a real
[1:37:38] believer was born to believe when it
[1:37:41] looks completely hopeless
[1:37:44] [Applause]
[1:37:46] what's god saying god saying i want you
[1:37:47] to believe
[1:37:48] on this side
[1:37:50] not on that side
[1:37:54] but when it looked impossible
[1:37:56] when pharaoh's army was behind when
[1:37:58] there was a mountain on the left on the
[1:37:59] right and a red sea in front of you
[1:38:02] god says that's when you're supposed to
[1:38:04] sing
[1:38:05] that's when you're supposed to believe
[1:38:07] i say lord help me to believe
[1:38:11] help me to believe then
[1:38:14] then
[1:38:15] lord
[1:38:16] on that side
[1:38:18] the bible says oh think about it verse
[1:38:21] 14 brother
[1:38:22] josh verse chapter 15 as the musicians
[1:38:25] can come
[1:38:26] verse 15 if you could put that up
[1:38:29] notice what they say then
[1:38:30] the dukes of edom shall be amazed the
[1:38:32] mighty men of moab trembling shall take
[1:38:34] hold upon them all
[1:38:36] the inhabitants of canaan shall melt
[1:38:39] away why because of what god had done
[1:38:41] verse 16 notice
[1:38:43] notice here they are fear and dread
[1:38:46] shall fall upon them by the greatness of
[1:38:48] thine arm they shall be as still as a
[1:38:51] stone
[1:38:52] till the till thy people pass over o
[1:38:54] lord till the people pass over which
[1:38:58] thou
[1:38:59] has purchased amen
[1:39:02] say brother matt that was a good song
[1:39:03] that was a powerful song that was right
[1:39:06] but how much more it would have meant to
[1:39:08] god if they could have sang that song
[1:39:11] on the other side of the red sea
[1:39:15] and how much more it means to god you
[1:39:17] say oh i'm going to sing a song when i
[1:39:20] get over there when all my battles are
[1:39:21] over and all the war is over oh i'm
[1:39:23] going to shout and rejoice then god's
[1:39:25] saying you should shout and rejoice now
