e [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] morning everyone God bless you let's go ahead and pull up the PowerPoint and we'll stand and read the word continuing from the subject from last week oh word family and we're going to look at Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 23 for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body Heavenly Father we just come to you and we want to commit this time to you Lord we ask that your Holy Spirit would come take your word break it open to our hearts Lord may may you you anoint both the speaker and the the hearer Lord For Your Glory we commit ourselves to you in Jesus name amen be seated so in looking at uh this subject looking at a word family is in in every age there's there's a reason there's a cause for alarm and there's also a cause for Brokenness and um we're all born into families that have people who have a sinful nature in them that they're battling against and you know in some ages you could go back and say we're we're looking at needing to rebuke the men so hard because they're mistreating their wives uh and that though that is certainly the case in uh wow we're empty I want to look this way there's nobody there but God is good so you have you have a situation now where feminism has come to its final fruition and any expression of manhood is many times is the world wants to suppress it and Men respond by either checking out or they respond by feminizing in themselves so that they can be acceptable to what the proper expression of human life is however I believe a real man of God would stand up and fight in every age and in every generation uh there's a reason there's a cause that we need to battle for there's a message that's going forth and you know when there is when there is Brokenness what happens is that Brokenness to often gets passed on then to the Next Generation and when that Brokenness is then passed on to the next Generation what you have is another response in that Sons will respond One Way daughters will respond another way and at some point in time all of us have to say this stops here I'm a Christian I believe the word I'm filled with the Holy Ghost that means I'm Healed am I don't need to uh I don't need to stand here and submit myself to perverted uh perverted examples that I've had from the past or acting out of the Brokenness that I have from the past instead of living in that place why don't we invite the Lord Jesus Christ into those situations that that caused the Brokenness let him come and stand stand with you in those situations of of abuse and and pain and even just the wrong example that the Lord Jesus was there with you if you're predestinated seed he didn't just suddenly come upon you when you got born again he had his hand on you before you were ever born and he was molding and shaping you into the person that you're supposed to be only let him redeem you from that Brokenness and then as there is Brokenness and there's always good or B good or bad you know you can be you could be raised in a situation where it's all bad you could be raised in a situation where it's a combination there's some good good stuff and there's some bad stuff or it could just be all good I'm pretty sure that's probably not all good because you're you're all we're all dealing with parents that uh didn't set a perfect example right and so neither neither do we and our children I I trust the Lord will enter into their hurts and their pains and will give them strength and deliver them as we talked about in overcoming depression we're all responsible for our own response to whatever situation we've went through we can't BL well my dad was this way my mom was this way certainly that has an impact but when you're a Christian old things are passed away all things are become new so don't don't walk under the Yoke of bondage see when you're not when you're not a Believer you have no choice you're walking under the Yoke of bondage but when you become a Believer you can choose to go back and walk under this yoke or you can choose to walk in Freedom that's what the Holy Ghost gives us and so I had that on my heart to start and say say that but looking at the hour that we're living in it's time for Christian men to throw off modern culture and the F feminization of everything and become real men again unafraid unafraid and and I I'll just say it this way our culture has trained us to be afraid of women it's trained us we should be afraid and not we should bow down before the idol of women that's what it's become the prophet said that it becomes an idol and it's it's dangerous the only one we're worshiping should be the Lord Jesus Christ amen and everyone else we are serving them and loving them and giving unto them and forgiving them but we don't have to be enter ourselves under this yoke of idolatrous burden and fear we have to become real Real Men Real leaders a real leader does not hurt and abuse those who he's leading that's not leadership that's dictatorship and it's evil a real leader understands that his duty is to do good to those that he's leading to serve and care for them and provide the necessary means for them to grow spiritually if we can understand what love is what is what what what is ultimately love in a Christian environment it is empowering and strengthening spiritual growth outside of that that's what God is doing so if we're standing in the way of people's spiritual growth what is that that's evil so if we're damaging hurting and and in minimizing and taking away people's spiritual growth then that's that's that's evil that's wickedness but if if we're living in such a way that we're helping others around us to grow in the Lord that is real genuine love it's projecting something out of yourself to help them grow up in Christ and so when you understand that as a man as a real leader you have that Vision you have that direction you're looking at life through that lens I am here to do good good to my wife to do good to my children not to control and manipulate them but to help them to grow up into Christ Real Men Are Men of Honor men of strength men of Bravery men of virtue they speak the truth in love they're courageous they're willing to die for the truth and they're willing to die to protect their wives and children that is is a real man and so we understand also that men are the stronger vessel that's never not been the case that's always been true so when the feminization of culture took place when women as brother Bram show showed us in America women got the vote this started taking the nation in the wrong direction and results in the the wickedness and immorality that we have for today so when when a woman usurp the authority of a man who has to let do it a man he has to let her do it so in our society the men let the women do what they're doing today and we've reached this place where we have a a wicked communist woman who's at the head of the Democrat Party now and so what what is what what is this that's happened it's men who are are weak men who don't want to speak the truth men who are unwilling to be brave to be courageous they simply have laid down their s the swords of their strength and allowed the woman to trample over them it can't be so you have to know who you are in Christ you have to take a stand and be a real man of Truth virtue strength and bravery so once the man allowed the woman to get out of her place then motherhood gets out of its place in the very next breath as we spoke about before brother brandham said the backbone of the nation is the mother right well then if if the mother is the backbone of the nation what is father he's the foundation of the nation that's what everyone else is going to walk upon what what you live how you live is going to be the foundation of what your children walk upon in their life and so when motherhood gets out of its place manhoods descent into sissified conditions ensues ensues this modern world of effeminate men what do they what is it now we've got skinny jeans and bangs over the forehead floppy floppy hair in your eyes I mean brother Bram condemned that so clearly the 1960s version what about today it's cissified it's not young men trying to be real men it's young young men being a bunch of boys not expressing real manhood why because they're not allowed to express real real manhood because it's not accepted their mothers won't accept it so what are they going to do they're going to go play video games because this is the way now I can express my manhood correctly is by doing killing video games you're not expressing your manhood that's further sissifying you and turning you into what the prophet called a jellyfish and that's the that's the age and that's the condition weak cissified men and entertainment of course portrays man as a bumbling fool of course he's protect and saved over and over again by the wisdom and strength of his wife he's just sort of along for the ride right I you see that the the men you know wife plans everything handles the finances does everything he's just sort of like he's another one of the kids what are we doing next I this is not an expression of real manhood not only that but we we have as brother brandham told us in the in the food supply it's been perverted by hybrids by GMOs and then also by inserting soy products in almost everything it's a estrogen turns men literally turns men into jellyfish and again God has a means and a and a way for young men to learn how to express their manhood we talked about before manliness starts with leadership and it starts with having a vision and a mission and a purpose in your life and working with the audacity to fulfill that and a real godly woman that's exactly what she's looking for she's not looking for someone that's searching for her she's praying for a Godly Man that has a vision that's looking forward that knows what he wants to accomplish in his life and that she can come and be his helper in that mission remember what we said before did God create Adam and say your mission is Eve no Adam came with a pre-existing Mission take dominion and multiply could Adam multiply on his own he could not he could take Dominion on his own certainly but it would be quite a limited Dominion a woman she can't take Dominion on her own she's a weaker vessel she struggles with that but a man can take Dominion a a woman being a weaker vessel can't do that but she can she can God uses her to multiply see so you see with the very design of creation and the Order of creation we we see God completing his picture right the the woman is designed to be weaker she's designed to as Paul said have a Meek and quiet Spirit not a loud boisterous overpowering personality but a Meek and quiet Spirit that's by Design it's a nurturing spirit that's what he's designed her to be not a leading Spirit but a nurturing spirit and the man is designed to lead to direct direct to be the head I just love how uncomfortable the devil gets when I preach this so we looked at this the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church this is by Design This is God's Eternal purpose God's Eternal purpose was that Christ would have a bride so when he designed Adam and Eve he designed Adam and Eve to be an expression of that we take the mind of Christ Adam had pre-existing Vision given to him by God that needs to be us we don't as men we don't come with our own Vision that's not manliness manliness is doing what Christ did and saying not my will father your will be done and then having the audacity to go and do it you know we we see depictions of Jesus and they sort of depict him as a little bit of a sissified person person he wasn't a sissified person he was a real strong man and he had the audacity to do what God I mean he walked into the temple with all the leaders and he braided whips and he whipped them and he shouted them down to not do what they were doing and if you go through what Jesus said how much of it is nice and sweet and how much of it is Harsh rebuke majority of it is Harsh speaking the truth into difficult circumstances and situations a real man a real man knows how to take the word in love and stand no matter what without fear of anything this is the pre-existing mission that God gave to Adam Genesis 1:26 that God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over over every creeping thing that creeps upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the follow of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the Earth all right so when God gave this commission this commission doesn't end it doesn't it doesn't change the gospel actually in itself is a connection to this missions go into all the world and preach the gospel we what are we doing we're preaching the gospel to bring them under the Dominion of Christ the lord and King and so that's directly connected but part of that is is your garden your home your family you're to take de a man is to take Dominion over everything over his family too right and he's to multiply he's to multiply the kingdom through his wife right so your your home is to be a kingdom multiplier it's not just where we have kids and raise them to do whatever we're multiplying the kingdom in our home and in our family and we're our that's the purp that's the driving purpose that's the driving vision of the family is to do what God said to do and to teach them to do what you're doing right to teach Sons to to have dominion to teach daughters to to know how to keep a home to know how to raise a family to know how to submit to her husband these are the things these are this is the vision that we have it's not just go to church uh enjoy the fellowship um listen to the preaching of the word I think sometimes we get so Rapture minded that we forget we're supposed to plant potatoes even the day before plant potatoes get married have children raise them to fear God with all your heart and the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it you know that this is also your commission men no not the literal Garden of Eden but you have your own Garden of Eden to dress and keep and this is what we talked about before there's a general mission for every man amen every man there's no exceptions and as I said it's directly connected to the Great Commission that Jesus left with his Apostles that wasn't just for the apostles that wasn't just for the five-fold ministry that is for every single believer and it starts first not on the missions field in your house in your home with your children that's why being the qualifications of being a minister of the word is actually directly connected to your leadership of your home how should how you you can't take Dominion in a greater sense if you can't take dominion over your own home leader spiritual leadership over your own home so the word dress in Hebrew is Abad it means to work to serve to work for another to serve by labor to serve as subjects in other words your God has given you stewardship over the Earth he's given you the charge to take dominion over it as as the prophet called it you're to be small gods upon the Earth you're to be Lords upon the Earth to take Dominion not on your not your own will not your own purpose but as stewards as managers put in place there by God to do it the way he has designed and purposed to do it so that's to dress and to keep is Shamar A Primitive route properly to hedge about that is to guard G generally to protect to attend to so there you're you're to be a guardian that is directly connected to the work of a husband to be a guardian you are the guardian of your wife you are the guardian of your children they're under your headship and you are supposed to be their guard not just physically any person can guard them physically but there's not just one realm out here there's not just a Physical Realm there's a spiritual realm and here to be a guard both spiritually because there's a there's a demon power that entered into the serpent right there's a spiritual power that entered into the serpent to come and destroy man's Garden right and he perverted the garden and man let him do it he knew he wasn't deceived he knew what was happen happening but he he went and redeemed his wife but yet it was his responsibility to be sure that that didn't happen because it did every atom every Quark every proton every Neutron is under the curse that's our connected Duty when Adam failed in his duty everything that belonged to him what did it do it entered into the curse the curse would be the ground for your sake it wasn't just the ground it was everything everything everything was then subject to death and men if you if you fail to be the guardian of your family everything is subject to death just the same spiritual death if you surrender the guardianship of your family to your wife it's a mistake you can't do that you must do it all right Proverbs 22 six train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it this is not just a little means of I don't know what happened there let's see this isn't just a nice little thing that's sort of like a yeah we should do that this is integral to your family life this is actually your stated purpose it's not a secondary thing it's not something we could say well we got Public School here in America well go ahead and send them off to the devil send them off to the Communists and be surprised that they come back like little Communists that's not our job that's not our duty it's our personal Duty as parents in the sight of God to train up our children it's not our duty to send them off somewhere now you might do that people have gotten tutors people have done different things through history ultimately it is your job to train them up in the way they should go not only a spiritual way that they should go but a vision for what they should do for work how they should live their life you're supposed to show Sons how to take responsibility for their for their homes for families you're supposed to show direct them and help them understand what they should do for work in their life not only that and then for daughters you're supposed to point them to what the scripture says of how they should prepare themselves for life not the way America or Europe does it or the Middle East or Africa but the way the word says to do it what the apostles teach to do it that's how that's the direction we are to give let's look at Abraham and the Lord said this is the great time when the Lord and two angels came down in human flesh to meet with Abraham just before the destruction of Sodom and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him for I know him listen this is his reason because for because I know him he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him so the L the Lord says I'm going to reveal my secret Mysteries to this man because he's not going to just keep it to himself he's going to teach and command his family after him amen and and we we we could see that in our own lives as we as we teach and speak of the word to others the word becomes revealed more and more to us and it's not it's a I I spoke about this last time it's not for us to merely rely on the ministry of the church to teach our children's spiritual things because we're the ones that are charged with the that responsibility we're not charged to drop them off at Sunday school I'm I'm all in favor of Sunday school but there's no verse in the Bible that even speaks about Sunday school it speaks about fathers speaks about dads teaching and training their family say I'm not a teacher well you are charged to teach and command your children it doesn't matter if you if you're not a teacher start doing it you'll get better at it you don't have to be a gifted Supernatural teacher to speak in the Pulpit but you can search and find the answers for yourself and you could pass that on to others that should be the duty of every father Yes get your children to church yes get them to Sunday school yes get them to youth camps no don't rely on that as the final story because I feel like you'll be sorely disappointed in the end that it won't achieve what you think it's going to achieve any of those other things being effective are are are effective because there's a dad in the home teaching the word that he's SP spending time with his children opening the scriptures going through the scriptures showing them the truth of the message it wouldn't be such a horrible problem of people walking away from the truth if we had more fathers in the home digging deeper in the word themselves and then passing that on to their children amen it's wonderful it's wonderful to have special devotions I think we should have that every day but it should go beyond that it should just be what we're talking about in the way when we're waking up when we're going to sleep when we're at the table these things it should be a passion in our heart as dads and I guess maybe as I leave uh the pulpit now I would say that it should be a passion in the hearts of dads to pass that on to their children and it should be such a passion that becomes infectious to them that you have a desire to bring the word to your to your children not just Doctrine but the life of the word that goes along with the true Doctrine bring that to your children so they have an understanding of the order of the home of the order of the word in our lives and how we're supposed to live digging deeper that's what all of our jobs are if you want if you want more Revelation I can tell you the reason why more Revelation came to Abraham was because God knew he would command his children after them so we can pray for more Revelation but we can also do what the word says and expect that more Revelation is going to come let's stand and pray Heavenly Father we just Look to You Lord we're so thankful for your goodness and mercy and Grace we ask that your Holy Spirit would be with us teaching us guiding us correcting us Lord today Lord may we enter into worship with all our hearts May each one of us get ourselves out of the way so that you can flow through us we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen [Music]
