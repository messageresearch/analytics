========================================

foreign good morning everyone may the lord bless you we're just going to start with a word of prayer gracious father we come to you in the name of jesus christ and we ask that your spirit would come and take your word and break it open to our hearts lord let it uh bring a supernatural effect upon our souls this morning lord may it may it break through the things of this world the the troubles the trials the the things that are afflicting us may break through everything and go to the just the very depth of our nature of our soul to bring something lord that would be of eternal value help me to step out of the way may your spirit come and take complete control of this vessel that only your word would flow forth from it we commit ourselves to you for your glory in jesus name amen we're gonna continue on the topic christian character uh part three it's been almost i think two months since i did it the part two so um but it's continuing on and we're looking at rest the christian attribute of rest so the first scripture i want to open up with is in hebrews chapter 4 and we're going to read 9 through 11. there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god for he that is entered into his rest his rest god's rest he also has ceased from his own works as god did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word rest is a biblical principle we find in both the old testament and the new testament if you look at if you study that word if in your in your e-sword or whatever program that you use look up rest and you'll find out and look at the different strong's definitions there's so many different words that are used that are translated into english in rest and what i gather from that is rest is multi-faceted and i the reason why it seems strange christian character and then to say rest is a part of christian character but i believe it's an inward state of the soul that is to permeate every characteristic that we have as believers so rest is multifaceted in that we can speak about an inward rest while at the very same time there is not an outward rest to the flesh for example the curse upon all of us was this in genesis 3 17 through 19. and unto adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and as eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it curse it is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return this is god placing a curse of not having rest of labor to the body which brings weariness and can bring with without any rest at all if you're to work seven days a week long hours no rest you can bring so so much damage to your body you damage not only your body you damage your mind and you ultimately will damage your soul if you don't bring some kind of rest to this body which is another principle which is the sabbath day that god established under the old testament for the jewish people this is a this continues not to be that we have to have a sabbath day on friday night to saturday night no but it's a principle in god's word you must take time to disconnect to rest to leave your physical life in the hands of god and say i'm just going to do nothing i'm going to cease from my labor so that i can have a refreshing to my body to my mind to my soul and if we don't do that there's consequences upon us you know we see a very basic principle of this you see chick-fil-a they close on sundays they do so much more business than any of other these other companies on those other six days that it pales and their their sales are just so much further above many many many many stores that are open seven days a week why because it's god's principle of rest if you don't rest you'll be a sick person you'll be a weak person you won't be everything that god created you to be that's one fast facet of the multi multi multifaceted aspects of rest but the but david in the psalms also speaks about not having any rest because of his sin so there's another aspect to it that we can take away our soul's rest that was purchased for us in christ by abiding in sin by allowing unbelief to take root in us and therefore the attributes of unbelief begin to manifest in our life and because of that we won't have rest because if you're born of the spirit of god and you start going after a sinful lifestyle you know it's possible that you as a born-again person can backslide can come to this place where you say ah you know the the devil can get your mind so messed up to where you just start going towards sinful life sinful attitude sinful way of thinking and what happens what happens to your rest in christ you don't have any that's actually god's grace he says okay you want to go towards sin i'm taking away your spiritual rest and we then we begin to panic and say what's going on what's happening something's wrong with why isn't god with me it's because of your walking and sin it's because you're choosing what to let sin have dominion over you and therefore you don't have spiritual rest and thank the lord for that correction paul also says he found no rest in his spirit because he couldn't find titus now that doesn't mean that paul didn't have spiritual rest in christ it simply meant the spirit is connected to the mind right so in his mind he couldn't find that place of rest because his purpose was to locate titus and send him on on a missions trip but he couldn't find him so he had no rest until he found titus i found him now we can go forward and do what god wants us to do another place he says when he was in macedonia that his flesh had no rest because he was troubled on every side again our flesh our spirit we can get to that place there's no rest troubles on every side we're weak but that's a different rest than what we're talking about for our soul it's not the same it's not the same thing just because you have trouble on the outside and you don't have rest on the outside doesn't mean that there's not rest on the inside so that's important to understand but at the same time god wants that rest that's in your soul to permeate the rest of you completely the rest is supposed to be not only inside but it's supposed to be expressed on the outside so what is rest you know these two things sometimes you it's hard to quantify them because we want to look at external things to define what rest is another word that goes along with that is peace um a different topic but humility is like that for me as well it's so it for me it's hard to quantify it because it's an inner it's an inside thing and yet that should be expressed on the outside so philippians 4 7 says in the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus so it is a peace of god that your spirit can't even comprehend that those five attributes of the mind cannot comprehend it's not an it's not something where you can okay i'm gonna go and explain why i have have peace in this situation it's the peace of god and it's beyond understanding why is it beyond understanding because humanly speaking there's no reason a person would have rest when they're troubled on every side humanly speaking there's no reason why a person would have rest when they're physically exhausted but yet there is a peace that can pass all of the understanding it bypasses all that goes directly to the soul and permeates your whole being really rest is almost synonymous with peace you know the jews have the greeting on this on their sabbath shabbat shalom you know it's two different words that almost have a very similar very similar connotation rest also speaks of tranquility another big word that we rarely use right now but tranquility according to webster's dictionary is quiet calm undisturbed peaceful not agitated the atmosphere is tranquil the state is tranquil a tranquil retirement is desirable but a tranquil mind is essential to happiness it's a quietness it's a calmness it's a state of not being agitated i think ultimately we can be in this position and place not because of our circumstances not because we work ourselves into the place where we indeed feel peace feel rest but we can rest because we serve a sovereign and faithful god god is in control of everything so that we understand our circumstances are ordained of the lord we can look at them and we can on on the outward side say this is messed up this is wrong why is this person done this why are they doing this why have i found myself in this situation at this point in time and then we can back up and say why are you grumbling god is in control god led you here god directed you here now you're here now you're complaining rest god is in control he's working something out in your life he's working out he's working out godly character in your life do you trust him if you trust him in this specific circumstance you can rest let's look at some of the different words and the way it's used in the old testament exodus 23 verse 12 says six days thou shalt do thy work and on the seventh day thou shalt rest that thine ox and thine ass may rest and the son of thy handmaid and the stranger may be refreshed so this is speaking of that literal day it's uh it's speaking of the word shabbat to cease desist rest to cause to cease to put into an end to desist from your stopping it's a day to stop but it's interesting that he doesn't use the same word for the cattle he use a different word for the cattle nuach nuach is the word and it but it carries a very similar meeting to rest to settle down to remain you just stop you cease from all labors and it says at the end that you may be refreshed that's what god wants he wants us to as a result of rest he wants us to be refreshed that's physically speaking but there's a spiritual type there as well um exodus 35 verse 2 six days shall work be done but on the seventh day there should there shall be to you and holy day a sabbath of rest to the lord whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death so did you notice there he says a sabbath of rest to the lord he uses the word a shabbat of shabbathan so it's almost like he's doubling up doubling up the use of the word right there but just a different different verb tense basically is what's being used and so you know this is to be a time that you rest if you work you're going to be put to death wow that is god being serious about rest it's not a joke it's it's not something that is a as a side issue god wants us to rest and the death penalty applies if you don't rest and so this is obviously we're not speaking of a literal day that's done away in christ we're not speaking of sunday we're speaking of something beyond that but it has spiritual connotations that if you don't enter into it it is spiritual death psalm 37 7 rest in the lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospers in his way because of the man who brings wicked devices to pass this word is a little different it's not shabbat it's a mom and it means to be silent be still wait to be dumb it means shut up keep your mouth be still and know that i am god stop grow dumb to be silent to be still to be struck dumb to make quiet so it's speaking of stop just stop let god take care of this situation commit it to him wait for him let him take care of it there's a wicked person he's prospering he's growing he's my enemy he's getting better what what's this getting stronger the spirit of this age is getting stronger it's coming against us more and more and it's increasing what are we to do rest that's what we're for that's the very first thing we're to do rest and wait patiently on the lord he will bring deliverance psalm 38 3-5 this is speaking on the negative side there is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin for my iniquities are gone over my head as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me my wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness it's an ugly terrible picture to be in that place in that position this is god's viewpoint of what it looks like to him when we're walking in sin a stinking wound that's completely corrupt we know what happens to stick people with stinking wounds what happens when a wound is infected that infection permeates the entire body and what happens to the body it's dead so don't let sin become a stinking wound in your flesh an infected wound in your body because it will permeate everything and it will destroy you no you won't be lost because you're born of the spirit of god but you can allow sin to take that dominion to seize you to where you have no rest into your body soul and spirit and it's a great danger for us as christians to allow us ourselves to be in that place psalm 95 7 through 11 for he is our god and we are the people of his pasture in the sheep of his hand today if you will hear his voice harden not your heart is in the provocation and is in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your father's tempted me proved me and saw my work forty years long was i grieved was i grieved with this generation and said it as a people that do air in their heart and they have not known my ways unto whom i swear in my wrath they should not enter into my rest this is the word mnucha it speaks of the resting place so the dwelling place of god and he's saying these people will not enter into the place where my presence abides why they refuse to hear my voice they refuse to believe the word that i've spoken therefore they cannot enter into that rest so we see in the old testament rest is a multi-faceted thing and it's an important theme really it permeates everything in the old testament they are to have rest from their enemies they are to rest from their labors one day a week there to rest every seven years there to have three feasts a year when they rest they're to enter into the rest or the dwelling place of the lord and there to have a shalom rest where they're not abiding in sin and i want to just finish on this quote from brother branham this is from the sermon the inner veil from 1956 january 21st says this now that is what i find around most christian lives most i hate to say it that way but it's true the most people that confess that can profess christianity they seem to have such a hard struggling time to hold on i believe it's because of a lack of correct teaching of the bible there's no such a thing as holding on he's done the holding on the whole christian principle is based upon rest what did he just say i'm just gonna stop right there the whole the whole that means all of it the entire christian principle that's why i'm talking about christian character and rest the whole christian principle is based upon rest come unto me all ye that labor and heavy laden and i will give you rest don't have to worry and struggle you're just resting that's all given rest you enter in peace that's the whole thing's finished them who he has called his justified them who is just justified he's all rest ready glorified scripture quoting notice it's nothing that you do or what you or what you can do it's what god has done for you in christ you could not come to someone said well i'll tell you i just quit this and when i went to seeking god no man ever sought god man don't seek god god seeks man the very beginning at the garden of eden proved it adam ought to have been running through the garden hollering father father where are you but it was god going through the garden of eden saying adam adam where art thou and adam was hiding that's the nature of man and jesus said no man can come to me except the father draws him first it's nothing you can do about it and jesus didn't come to the calvary to die for a haphazard purpose he didn't come there and say well maybe i'll die it'll be so pathetic to some people they'll see that i died and maybe they'll come and serve the lord jesus come for a specific purpose to redeem those who god by foreknowledge elected to come to him that's correct if you whose scholars that know the bible know that even the patriarchs made an example abraham is god's election god called abraham when he wasn't nothing nobody he's just an ordinary man i'm just gonna take a moment before we stop there that brother branham there makes such a profound incredibly profound statement the whole christian principle starts with rest and then he establishes why that is why is it based on rest because it's not what you've done it's not what you do it's not even you seeking god god has called you god has changed your heart changed your life god has given you the righteousness of jesus christ therefore you can rest because it's him calling you and christ specifically came to die for luther's sins for george's sins for jason's sins specifically for me not in a haphazard way my personal sins from the day i was the day i was accountable to god till the day that i die or am raptured every one of those sins was placed on jesus christ in the garden of gethsemane and he took them and carried them and god poured his wrath out upon jesus christ upon that body and my sins were expiated there at the cross and i was forgiven there and all of it's put in the sea of god's forgetfulness before i was even born and then he called me he changed me he's leading my life then i can rest then i can know this sovereign god who's already finished the work at calvary will accomplish the work that he's purposed to do that is scripture that is god's purpose that's the restored faith that we're resting on let's pray heavenly father we just come to you lord and we're so thankful for the light of your word that we can rest and that this rest is based upon exactly what brother branham taught it to be there because that is exactly the scripture that's been restored to us and we're thankful for that lord help us to enter into rest we commit ourselves we commit the service to you for your glory in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you
