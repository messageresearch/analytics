[0:14] um
[0:21] good morning everyone good morning let's
[0:23] pray
[0:25] heavenly father we just come together
[0:29] studying your word lord and worship and
[0:32] preaching of the word to you we ask that
[0:33] your holy spirit will be
[0:35] in complete control of every heart every
[0:38] mind
[0:39] lord that you would be glorified
[0:51] priesthood of all believers this is part
[0:54] two
[0:56] and um
[0:59] just continuing on from the last time if
[1:01] you look at all the
[1:03] orthodox churches in the world
[1:06] they always have an order of priests so
[1:09] you look at the eastern orthodox
[1:11] oriental orthodox
[1:13] and the roman catholic they all have
[1:15] priests
[1:16] who they've ordained to perform the
[1:20] sacraments
[1:21] for the laity right so this is this is a
[1:25] going way back in history that they've
[1:27] started this
[1:28] and we you know you can read in the
[1:30] church ages book
[1:32] and and we'll do a little bit of that
[1:33] today where you see that development
[1:35] where it started out with
[1:37] elders in a local church who were
[1:40] overseeing
[1:41] the word overseer in greek is the same
[1:44] word that we've transliterated to
[1:47] bishop it's like it's much it's much
[1:49] like the word uh
[1:50] baptism baptism has no meaning in the
[1:54] english language it's transliterated
[1:55] from the greek baptizo
[1:58] so it's directly from the greek and
[2:00] they've just created a new word
[2:02] essentially for it
[2:03] but if they were to literally translate
[2:04] the word baptism it would mean
[2:06] immersion we be immersed
[2:10] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[2:12] then and
[2:13] for the word bishop you look at that
[2:16] word
[2:17] episcopal is the word bishop this comes
[2:20] from
[2:20] coming from the latin much
[2:23] not that we need a latin and historic
[2:25] history of
[2:27] the language words but rapture rapture
[2:29] is not
[2:30] it's always accused it's not in the
[2:32] bible right it's the word it's from the
[2:35] latin word rapturo
[2:37] which is translated from the greek word
[2:39] catching away harpazo
[2:41] harpazo to latin rapturo to english
[2:44] rapture so it just means catching away
[2:49] this word bishop is coming from
[2:53] episcopal that simply means overseer
[2:58] or to visit is another another word that
[3:01] that speaks of it to oversee by
[3:03] visitation
[3:05] so they took these words elder presbyter
[3:08] and episcopals
[3:11] they separated these two offices in the
[3:14] time
[3:15] of the early church and they made a
[3:18] bishop
[3:19] over many many local churches
[3:23] and then as time went on they changed
[3:25] changed the meaning instead of being
[3:27] a pastor they changed it from being a
[3:30] pastor to a priest
[3:32] now there's a hierarchy of priests and
[3:35] that's where we
[3:36] find this understanding in eastern
[3:38] orthodox
[3:40] all the all the orthodox churches roman
[3:42] catholic whatever it might be
[3:44] i think anglican also has that viewpoint
[3:47] where they call them priests
[3:50] and so we understand the jewish jewish
[3:52] faith had
[3:53] priests they had when they had a
[3:55] sacrificial system in operation in
[3:57] israel
[3:58] that was up until 70 a.d when titus
[4:01] attacked
[4:02] and destroyed the temple since that time
[4:05] they have not had an
[4:06] operational priesthood they have rabbis
[4:10] and it doesn't matter what tribe or what
[4:12] clan they come from
[4:14] they're simply teachers of the law but
[4:17] the sacrificial system
[4:18] does not exist in judaism anymore
[4:22] therefore they have no priesthood
[4:25] now they're looking forward to a time
[4:26] when it will be restored
[4:28] but since 7080 it has not existed
[4:31] anywhere
[4:32] on earth
[4:35] in islam they have no they actually have
[4:37] no priesthood at all
[4:41] but if you look at other pagan religions
[4:44] through history
[4:46] they always relied on animal sacrifices
[4:49] and as such they always had
[4:50] a priesthood and the priest
[4:53] the intention of the priesthood is to be
[4:57] a mediator a special class of people
[5:01] that were separated for the purpose
[5:04] of mediating between
[5:08] the people and whatever deity that they
[5:11] were
[5:11] serving so basically they're mediators
[5:15] between god the gods
[5:18] and mankind so in the christian faith we
[5:21] understand
[5:22] the little levitical priesthood has been
[5:24] set aside
[5:26] and a new priest arises after a
[5:29] different order
[5:30] hebrews 7 verses 11 and 12.
[5:38] if therefore perfection were by the
[5:39] levitical priesthood
[5:41] for under it the people received the law
[5:44] what further need was there that another
[5:46] priest should
[5:47] should rise after the order of
[5:49] melchizedek
[5:51] and not be called after the order of
[5:53] aaron
[5:54] for the priesthood being changed there
[5:56] is made of necessity a change
[5:58] also of the law
[6:02] and verse 18 for there is verily a
[6:05] disallowing of the commandment
[6:07] going before for the weakness and
[6:10] unprofitableness
[6:12] there of it's a very strange and
[6:16] interesting way to speak about
[6:19] laws instituted by god
[6:23] the referring to laws or commandments
[6:26] which were weak and unprofitable
[6:30] now this can't be speaking of the moral
[6:33] law
[6:34] the moral law is actually an expression
[6:37] it's eternal
[6:38] and it's expression of the very nature
[6:41] of god himself the moral law
[6:44] is never done away with we're not of
[6:46] those christians who say there's no
[6:48] moral law
[6:50] governing god's people there is it's
[6:52] just how that's applied
[6:53] has changed now under the new covenant
[6:56] so the moral law
[6:57] ten commandments is not passing away
[7:00] what is being disannulled disannulled
[7:02] means
[7:03] literally means cancelled
[7:06] so what is being cancelled the
[7:09] sacrificial
[7:10] law that's the very thing that paul is
[7:13] speaking about in hebrews
[7:15] in chapter seven eight and nine
[7:18] read it on your own time there's a new
[7:20] covenant he promises a new covenant
[7:22] paul is saying he promised under the old
[7:25] covenant a new covenant
[7:26] why did he do that he promised in the
[7:28] psalms that there would be a priest
[7:30] come after the order of melchizedek if
[7:33] the first priesthood was perfect
[7:36] and could make the worshipers perfect
[7:39] why
[7:39] did god have to promise a new covenant
[7:42] and a new priesthood
[7:46] so if there's a new one coming it means
[7:48] there's a change
[7:49] and there's a cancellation these things
[7:51] are simple basic
[7:53] for us but for the jewish understanding
[7:56] it's it's a
[7:57] it's a radical revelation that was a
[8:00] complete mystery they didn't
[8:02] they didn't understand these things this
[8:03] way whatsoever
[8:05] and paul comes along and says don't you
[8:07] see there's a promise
[8:08] of a new priesthood don't you see
[8:10] there's a promise of a new
[8:12] covenant that means this one isn't the
[8:14] perfect one
[8:16] you say but god instituted it god
[8:19] instituted it to show us
[8:21] what not to show that he's imperfect
[8:24] to show you and i that we are
[8:28] imperfect that we can accomplish it but
[8:31] not only that
[8:32] to show that the system of animal
[8:34] sacrifices cannot
[8:36] truly forgive sins the blood and bull of
[8:39] bulls and goats
[8:40] only covered sins and pushed them
[8:42] forward why
[8:44] every year they had to do it over and
[8:47] over
[8:47] and over again next the next year comes
[8:50] the feast of atonement
[8:52] maybe there's a new high priest that
[8:53] priest has to first offer us
[8:55] sacrifice for himself and then for the
[8:57] people that's a continual
[8:59] process that is by nature imperfect
[9:03] a perfect sacrifice had to come that
[9:06] could be offered once
[9:08] for all christ offered his blood
[9:11] he becomes the priest after the order of
[9:13] melchizedek not after the order of aaron
[9:16] but after the order of melchizedek
[9:19] there's a new
[9:21] priestly order that comes place now
[9:25] first timothy 2 5 there isn't multiple
[9:28] multiple sacrifices for sins right
[9:32] there isn't a priestly order that's
[9:35] making sacrifices continually
[9:38] to cover sins
[9:41] first timothy 2 verse 5 says for there
[9:43] is one god
[9:45] and one mediator between god and men
[9:48] the man christ jesus there's no other
[9:51] mediators
[9:52] a prophet is not a mediator
[9:55] why am i saying that a messenger from
[9:58] god is not a mediator he is a channel
[10:01] for the holy spirit to communicate
[10:03] through but
[10:04] a prophet a messenger an apostle paul
[10:07] was not
[10:08] making a sacrifice for sin paul was not
[10:12] offering himself
[10:13] as a sacrifice for sin in in catholicism
[10:17] they have the mass
[10:18] every time they do the mass they say
[10:20] it's the sacrifice
[10:22] of the mass and they're sacrificing
[10:25] every time
[10:26] over and over again in their minds
[10:30] the son of god that's a sacrifice and
[10:32] the people eat it
[10:33] and they receive forgiveness of sins by
[10:35] taking
[10:36] this sacrifice upon themselves
[10:40] it's completely false he was off his
[10:42] body was offered
[10:43] once for all his blood was shed once
[10:47] he went up to god he offered that blood
[10:50] once and god says
[10:54] it's done the sin questions answered the
[10:57] now the worshipers that come to god can
[11:00] be perfect
[11:02] they their their conscience can be
[11:04] totally cleansed
[11:06] under the law what was it every year
[11:10] we're making a sacrifice for your sins
[11:13] that you didn't realize that you
[11:14] committed
[11:15] that you didn't confess that you forgot
[11:17] about that's what the atonement was for
[11:19] was for sins that were done in ignorance
[11:23] the the feast of atonement sins that
[11:25] were committed in ignorance and
[11:27] they did it every year again and again
[11:31] now that's not necessary that's
[11:33] fulfilled in christ
[11:35] all of our sins are obliterated by that
[11:38] blood
[11:39] now once that blood is offered that in a
[11:42] new covenant
[11:43] comes forth now we have a new covenant
[11:46] no sacrifice is needed no other means of
[11:50] washing away our sins
[11:52] is needed it's all by that blood
[11:56] that's why on the cross when he was
[11:58] dying he said
[12:00] it is finished tetelestai that's what he
[12:03] said
[12:04] in greek tetelestai is stamped
[12:07] on documents when the full price
[12:11] was paid for something they stamped
[12:13] tetelestai
[12:15] it is finished the price has been paid
[12:18] there's no more
[12:19] sacrifices for sinned the work has
[12:22] been completed
[12:31] now exodus 19 5-6
[12:35] i kind of skipped ahead from here but i
[12:36] want to cover this
[12:39] this is god's promise to the nation of
[12:42] israel
[12:44] look what he says now therefore if
[12:48] i want to highlight that word if if you
[12:51] will obey
[12:52] my voice indeed and keep my covenant
[12:55] then shall you be a peculiar treasure
[12:58] unto me
[12:59] above all people for all the earth is
[13:01] mine
[13:02] and you shall be unto me a kingdom of
[13:04] priests and a holy nation
[13:06] these are the words which thou shalt
[13:08] speak unto the children of
[13:10] israel if you will
[13:13] obey did they they did not
[13:17] obey so his promise of being
[13:21] kings and priests to israel was
[13:24] conditional
[13:25] on their keeping of the covenant the
[13:28] entire
[13:28] historical books in the old testament
[13:31] are detailing
[13:32] they did not do that read the end of
[13:34] deuteronomy
[13:35] what is the psalm what is the song that
[13:38] moses sings
[13:40] it's quite a dark song it's not happy
[13:43] it's not a rejoicing song the song is
[13:45] you will not
[13:47] keep the covenant that's what he sings
[13:49] over them
[13:50] you will not keep the covenant you will
[13:52] disobey the covenant
[13:53] and god will bring all these curses upon
[13:56] you that he's promised
[13:57] he'll send you in out of this land
[14:00] so even their living in the land of
[14:02] israel was conditional
[14:04] on their obedience if they disobey i'll
[14:08] cast you out
[14:09] if you disobey you're not kings and
[14:11] priests
[14:12] and their ultimate disobedience was what
[14:14] rejecting the messiah
[14:16] they rejected and turned against the
[14:18] messiah
[14:20] of course this is all in god's plan god
[14:22] god preordained this to happen that way
[14:25] he wasn't taken off guard but they
[14:27] rejected the messiah
[14:29] and then god said okay you're done the
[14:31] temple is destroyed
[14:32] your word your form of worship is
[14:35] altered
[14:37] until until i restore it until i restore
[14:40] you
[14:42] but the promise conditional upon
[14:45] us what happens when promises
[14:48] of god are conditional upon us over and
[14:51] over and over again what if
[14:52] what if all conditions are perfect
[14:54] around us
[14:56] the garden of eden what if everything is
[14:58] perfect
[15:01] how will we keep the covenant
[15:04] no no it's not going to happen we cannot
[15:08] keep the covenant the story of the bible
[15:10] is that you can't do
[15:12] it you cannot do it on your own you're
[15:14] totally incapable
[15:16] and so he says i will make a new
[15:17] covenant i will write
[15:20] my laws in your heart and in your mind i
[15:23] will put my spirit
[15:25] to live inside of you and to keep my own
[15:27] laws
[15:28] and i will shed blood so that your sins
[15:31] are completely obliterated so that you
[15:32] stand in my
[15:33] sight as though you're perfect when god
[15:36] does it
[15:38] it's done when you and i do it it's a
[15:41] it all our righteousness is as filthy
[15:45] rags so let's look at revelation 1
[15:50] 5 and 6.
[15:53] and from jesus christ who is the
[15:55] faithful witness and the first begotten
[15:57] of the dead
[15:58] and the prince of the kings of the earth
[16:00] unto him that loved us
[16:02] and washed us from our sins in his own
[16:05] blood
[16:06] and hath made us kings and priests unto
[16:08] god and his father to him be glory and
[16:10] dominion forever and ever amen
[16:12] did you catch that he made us
[16:16] by his blood he made us kings and
[16:19] priests
[16:20] to israel he said if you obey
[16:24] you'll be kings and priests here he says
[16:27] you know what
[16:29] you can't i showed you for thousands of
[16:33] years you can't
[16:34] now i will make you kings and priests
[16:38] think about the grace of god to us
[16:40] gentiles
[16:42] we were not the chosen people god was
[16:44] not even dealing
[16:46] with gentiles for thousands of years and
[16:49] what happened
[16:50] what happens the jews reject him he
[16:52] turns to the gentiles and said
[16:54] i have made you kings and priests
[16:57] by the blood of jesus christ now it's a
[17:01] grace
[17:02] covenant to make us kings and priests
[17:05] revelations 5
[17:06] 9-10 and they sung a new song
[17:10] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[17:12] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[17:14] a slain and has redeemed us to god by
[17:16] thy blood
[17:18] out of every kindred and tongue
[17:21] and people and nation that were redeemed
[17:23] as purchased he paid
[17:25] the purchase price he didn't at that
[17:27] time he hadn't yet
[17:28] claimed his purchase
[17:32] in in in the world of that day just like
[17:35] marriage
[17:36] there's two parts to every purchase when
[17:39] you make a purchase
[17:40] you first pay the price in in in
[17:43] marriage
[17:44] in at this point in time in history in
[17:47] the jewish
[17:48] nation first they had the betrothal
[17:51] that was where you paid a price
[17:54] so the father of the groom paid the
[17:57] father
[17:58] of the bride a certain amount that they
[18:01] negotiated
[18:03] that was the purchase price
[18:06] then when he was when the the wedding
[18:09] was to take place
[18:10] then he would receive what he had paid
[18:13] for
[18:14] so christ at calvary paid the price
[18:17] right
[18:18] now he comes in spirit form in our day
[18:21] to receive his bride to himself to and
[18:24] to enter into an invisible
[18:26] union spiritual union with his bride
[18:29] but it's by that purchase price now we
[18:33] enter into a new
[18:35] relationship and he
[18:38] you have through that blood through that
[18:40] purchase
[18:41] you've made us unto our god kings and
[18:44] priests
[18:46] and we shall reign on the earth amen
[18:49] we are now in the relationship in the
[18:52] position
[18:53] of kings and priests and in the future
[18:56] in the millennium
[18:57] we will reign on the earth revelation 20
[18:59] verse 6.
[19:03] blessed and holy is he that hath part in
[19:05] the first resurrection on such
[19:07] the second death hath no power but they
[19:10] shall be priests of god
[19:12] and of christ and shall reign with him a
[19:15] thousand
[19:16] years so under all religions in history
[19:20] there was a special class of people
[19:23] called priests they were the mediators
[19:25] between
[19:27] the deity and the people but now
[19:30] under the new this new covenant that's
[19:33] made in the blood of christ
[19:36] every single believer is a priest
[19:40] think about that every single believer
[19:43] is a priest first peter
[19:45] 2 5
[19:49] ye also as lively stones are built up a
[19:52] spiritual house
[19:53] a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[19:55] sacrifices acceptable to god
[19:58] by jesus christ who was peter writing to
[20:02] was he writing to preachers only
[20:05] absolutely zero evidence of that he was
[20:07] writing to saints
[20:10] he was writing to believers every
[20:12] believer
[20:13] and then verse nine but you are a chosen
[20:16] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[20:18] nation
[20:19] a peculiar people that you should show
[20:21] forth the praises of him
[20:23] who has called you out of darkness into
[20:26] his marvelous light so
[20:30] every believer is a priest this has to
[20:32] this completely does away
[20:34] with catholic catholicism and all the
[20:36] orthodox
[20:38] faiths that separate the priesthood
[20:41] into a different class of people that's
[20:44] completely done away with
[20:46] okay so we're priests priests we're
[20:48] always doing what
[20:49] under the old covenant offering
[20:52] sacrifices
[20:53] right do we offer sacrifices we covered
[20:56] that
[20:56] pretty clearly there is no more
[20:59] sacrifice for
[21:01] sin the work is completed a perfect
[21:04] sinless sacrifice was offered
[21:06] and now we have a new high priest after
[21:09] the order of melchizedek
[21:11] and he stands as the only mediator
[21:13] between god and men
[21:14] we are not mediators between god and men
[21:19] because we didn't offer a sacrifice and
[21:20] we are not that high priest
[21:24] but let's look at it this way under the
[21:25] old covenant not
[21:27] every sacrifice that was given
[21:30] had to do with sin so if you look at
[21:33] this there were five
[21:35] different types of sacrifices i'm not
[21:37] going to go into detail on this
[21:39] there was the burnt offering obviously
[21:41] has to do with sin
[21:42] there was the grain or meal offering it
[21:45] actually has nothing to do with sin
[21:48] there's the sin offering obviously has
[21:50] to do with sin
[21:52] there's the guilt offering again has to
[21:54] do with sin
[21:55] and there's a peace offering it doesn't
[21:57] directly have to do with sin
[21:59] but it has to do with restoring
[22:01] fellowship
[22:02] between god and men therefore it's
[22:04] definitely connected
[22:06] to the sacrifice of jesus christ so
[22:09] there's four different
[22:10] sacrifices that we can definitely tie to
[22:13] being fulfilled
[22:14] by jesus christ but there's one which is
[22:17] the grain or the meal offering
[22:20] this grain offering was
[22:23] a dedication it was a dedication it was
[22:27] basically saying thank you god
[22:31] for what you've done for me so what do
[22:34] we do
[22:35] in our priesthood let's look at this
[22:38] and again this is all about worship
[22:41] what is priesthood it's all about
[22:43] worship what is the gospel all about
[22:47] ultimately it's all about worship
[22:50] the great commission was to go out and
[22:53] create
[22:54] worship for god where there wasn't
[22:55] worship for the true and living god
[22:58] so when we are acting as priests
[23:02] what is it it's worship
[23:06] so again we read these already but you
[23:08] are a spirit first peter two verse five
[23:11] you're built up a spiritual house holy
[23:13] priesthood to offer up
[23:14] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god
[23:19] by jesus christ our spiritual sacrifices
[23:23] are only acceptable to god by jesus
[23:26] christ
[23:28] now because of the blood of jesus christ
[23:31] we can now
[23:32] have direct access to god
[23:35] because of the blood that he shed the
[23:37] veil was rent
[23:38] and we can walk in to the very presence
[23:42] of god
[23:43] where only the high priest could go once
[23:46] per year
[23:47] now we're all if we don't go in it's
[23:50] death
[23:51] before if we did go in it would be death
[23:53] now if we don't
[23:54] enter inside the veil it's death
[23:59] but we can only do that by jesus christ
[24:02] we can't do that
[24:02] on our own efforts then verse nine we're
[24:05] a whole a chosen generation a royal
[24:07] priesthood a holy nation a pupil your
[24:09] people
[24:11] why that you should show forth the
[24:14] praises
[24:15] of him who has called you
[24:18] hebrews 13 15
[24:23] why are we supposed let me back up why
[24:25] are we supposed to
[24:26] show forth the praises of him who has
[24:28] called you out of darkness because
[24:31] he's our object of worship beyond that
[24:34] so that others
[24:35] would hear and see what god has done for
[24:39] you and they could enter into the same
[24:42] called us out of darkness into his
[24:44] marvelous light what is that talking
[24:45] about
[24:46] salvation redemption
[24:49] so why are we praising him for his
[24:52] redemption
[24:54] for his salvation because he's worthy of
[24:57] it
[24:57] and because he wants others to enter in
[25:01] and experience that same thing hebrews
[25:04] 13 15 by him therefore let us offer the
[25:06] sacrifice
[25:08] of praise to god continually that is the
[25:10] fruit of our lips giving thanks to his
[25:14] name again it's not just lifting our
[25:17] hands in a worship service
[25:19] right this is the this is going right
[25:22] down to the nitty-gritty of you
[25:24] how you speak what is your confession
[25:27] what do you talk about on a daily basis
[25:30] are your lips giving thanks to his name
[25:33] or is it talking about how dark and how
[25:35] bad and how terrible it is
[25:37] or are you talking about how great god
[25:39] is in the midst of all this
[25:46] um my goodness i guess there's probably
[25:49] gonna be a part three here
[25:52] um let me read this quote and then we'll
[25:55] close
[25:56] with that it's from faith is the
[25:58] substance in 1951
[26:00] the love of god is like a notary public
[26:04] takes a seal and presses it until the
[26:06] inscription of that seal
[26:08] is pressed in the paper over the
[26:10] signature oh my
[26:11] and when christ signs your name on the
[26:13] book of life and the holy spirit presses
[26:15] it in there until the life of christ is
[26:17] formed in you
[26:18] hallelujah becomes deity men and women
[26:21] are sons and daughters of god
[26:24] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[26:25] but we know we shall be we'll be like
[26:27] him for we will see him as he is
[26:30] have a body like his own glorious body
[26:31] and we're waiting for our perfect
[26:33] redemption amen you believe it
[26:35] our bodies are growing and we have an
[26:37] inheritance and we're children now heirs
[26:39] of the kingdom kings and priests
[26:41] unto god offering spiritual sacrifices
[26:43] what does a priest do
[26:45] make a sacrifice what is a spiritual
[26:48] sacrifice that's what
[26:49] these sons and daughters do which are
[26:51] kings and priests yet not in full
[26:52] position but they're making sacrifices
[26:55] offering to god spiritual sacrifices the
[26:58] fruit of our lips giving praise
[27:01] to his name fruits of our lips you say
[27:03] brother branham
[27:04] i just don't feel like praising him
[27:06] that's the time to make the sacrifice
[27:09] praise him anyhow kings and priests sons
[27:11] and daughters offering spiritual
[27:13] sacrifice
[27:14] the fruit of our lips giving praise unto
[27:17] his name
[27:18] let's stand
[27:21] heavenly father we just come to you lord
[27:23] and we ask that you would bring the
[27:25] quickening of the word into our hearts
[27:29] draw us closer to you lord move in a
[27:31] mighty way in the service father through
