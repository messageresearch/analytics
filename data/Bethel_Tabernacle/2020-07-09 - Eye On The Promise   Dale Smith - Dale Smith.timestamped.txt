[17:05] worship Him
[17:06] you know worship is more than singing

[17:56] preacher for today is Dale Smith so
[17:59] that's where I was at out in the
[18:02] wilderness enjoying myself it was very
[18:05] good another thing I wanted to mention
[18:07] was a seating basically we're sitting in
[18:10] the even rows in each section from the
[18:13] front until it gets
[18:15] contrariwise sometimes we will put
[18:17] families and stuff in row right after
[18:19] each other but when you first come in
[18:21] and stuff it's 2 4 6 8 2 4 6 8 2 4 6
[18:25] that's the way you want to come in
[18:29] I had to peel some gum off of a seat
[18:32] this evening so I know it's kind of
[18:35] embarrassing I'm not here to embarrass
[18:37] anybody we all know that you know we
[18:41] don't want to be chewing gum in the
[18:43] sanctuary if you happen to come in the
[18:45] sanctuary and you don't realize it and
[18:47] you get told that's fine just just put
[18:50] it in a tissue or just get up and get
[18:52] rid of it but please do not put gum on
[18:56] the seats I had to change a seat this
[18:58] evening so this nobody would sit on it
[19:01] so we just want to it's a simple thing
[19:05] if you get if you forget about it that's
[19:06] fine but just don't be sticking it on
[19:08] the seats and like our brother said the
[19:11] offering is in the back for his Lord you
[19:15] know I'm I'm looking towards heaven you
[19:20] know I I could I could look at so many
[19:22] things in this world that are just

[33:25] were able to to come out this evening
[33:27] greet you in the name of the Lord if you
[33:29] have your Bibles invite you straight
[33:31] away into the book of first we'll go
[33:35] we're going to look at one place in
[33:36] first Kings chapter 18 and then we'll go
[33:41] over into second Kings as well have
[33:44] several places in Scripture we want to
[33:46] refer to this evening and
[33:56] get all my buttons pushed here praise
[34:00] the Lord
[34:04] we're in first Kings chapter 18 I want
[34:08] to begin reading at verse 20 first Kings
[34:12] chapter 18 and verse 20 so Ahab sent
[34:16] unto all the children of Israel and
[34:18] gathered the prophets together unto
[34:21] Mount Carmel and Elijah came unto the
[34:24] people and said how long halt ye between
[34:28] two opinions if the Lord be God follow
[34:34] him but if bale them follow him and the
[34:42] people answered not a word isn't that
[34:49] striking may the Lord bless the reading
[34:53] of the word this evening as you have
[34:54] your seats you would think that after
[35:04] three and a half years of drought after
[35:09] three and a half years where food became
[35:13] so scarce and that water became so
[35:16] scarce and people were dying and cattle
[35:20] were dying and crops were failing in the
[35:24] field and that was such a challenge as
[35:28] this that the people would have been
[35:30] able to say something they should have
[35:35] they were a people that were called of
[35:37] God that there were there were a people
[35:40] that had followed the law of Moses that
[35:42] that had been raised up and had saw the
[35:46] revival of the times of Solomon and and
[35:49] knew of the exploits of David and and
[35:52] had read and told the stories of Moses
[35:57] and of the flood and and all of these
[36:00] things in it at least at this time under
[36:03] such great opposition in such great
[36:08] terrible
[36:09] like that they were under that at least
[36:11] some house somebody would have been able
[36:14] to say yes will will serve the Lord but
[36:20] they answered not a word I just find
[36:26] that to be very disturbing because I
[36:31] believe that as we see in the scripture
[36:35] that everything that we see brother Bram
[36:38] tells us that the Old Testament he said
[36:41] is the mother of the New Testament he
[36:44] tells us that the Old Testament was a
[36:46] types and shadows and how that those
[36:48] types and shadows would be reflected out
[36:51] and we would see Jesus Christ in every
[36:55] verse of scripture and so if that be the
[36:58] case then we would we would be able to
[37:01] say that as it was in the days of this
[37:04] Elijah and in the time of this a
[37:07] happened in the time of the this school
[37:10] of prophets and at this time where there
[37:13] was a the prophets of bail and and false
[37:16] teachers and false narrative and and
[37:18] faked news and all these other kind of
[37:21] things that was going on in this day
[37:22] that you would think Amen that we would
[37:25] be able to see that the self same thing
[37:27] has taken place in the hour that we live
[37:29] in and today the same same challenge
[37:33] this that there's the same voice of an
[37:37] elijah prophet has gone forth in this
[37:39] day
[37:40] hey man and said why halt you between
[37:44] two opinions if the Lord be gone then
[37:50] follow him and so Elijah brought this
[37:56] challenge the prophet of God said it was
[38:00] the Mount Carmel showdown in so Elijah
[38:06] brought the challenge and we know the
[38:08] story quite well and and how that the
[38:12] you know the the altar was built and the
[38:14] false prophets and the prophets of bale
[38:16] and and different ones that they stood
[38:18] there and they and they and they cut
[38:20] themselves and they went through
[38:22] all these exercises to me one of the
[38:27] great conundrums of this person this
[38:32] particular verse of scripture was that
[38:36] if the challenge was given to these men
[38:39] to to build an altar and to cut up a
[38:41] Bulacan and pour water upon it in and do
[38:45] all these things that and and and that
[38:49] there these men these four hundred
[38:52] prophets that there were there there had
[38:54] to be something I'm just saying this is
[38:57] there's nothing in the scripture that
[38:58] says this is this is just my
[39:01] observations as best that I can deduct
[39:04] from reading the scripture but but if if
[39:07] unless something like this this was not
[39:12] uncommon to these prophets this
[39:16] challenge was accepted and and and they
[39:21] went through with it and so they had to
[39:24] have believed or had to have some kind
[39:27] of witchery or some kind of supernatural
[39:31] something in their in their past or they
[39:34] would have never ever taken the
[39:37] challenge they would have said no this
[39:40] is they would have just backed out
[39:42] immediately but under their religion
[39:45] under their conception of what they
[39:50] believed was real and true they had to
[39:53] have believed that somehow that fire was
[39:56] going to come down and was going to
[39:58] vindicate them or they would have never
[40:00] taken that challenge so I have to say
[40:06] that for these men they had they had
[40:09] more about them than Billy Graham did
[40:12] because Billy Graham was given that same
[40:15] challenge by the Hindus and he turned it
[40:19] down and he walked away
[40:20] brother Brown said I would rather have
[40:23] gone there and failed than to let
[40:25] somebody challenge the Word of God and
[40:28] make fun of the Word of God he said I
[40:31] would have win away as a failure before
[40:33] i relent that
[40:34] make that challenge but the people
[40:40] answered not a word striking if you
[40:49] would turn with me over into 2nd Kings
[40:51] chapter 2 why ho Chi between two
[41:01] opinions
[41:02] I want to title the message tonight the
[41:06] Lord will help us be students of our
[41:10] time but I want to tile it I on the
[41:19] promise because the Bible says there
[41:27] then that Elijah that he offered that
[41:30] sacrifice he says at thy word according
[41:37] to the evening sacrifice as the way that
[41:40] you have shown me Elisha was was
[41:43] operating under a supernatural under a
[41:47] biblical mandate that had been handed
[41:51] down to him from God Almighty and he was
[41:54] standing there knowing because he had
[41:56] breslin said he had saw the vision of it
[41:58] and he was operating under that under
[42:02] that anointing that God was going to
[42:05] vindicate right and wrong we realized
[42:09] that that is the spirit that was upon
[42:11] Elijah that handed down now we find him
[42:15] here again in chapter 2 of 2nd Kings on
[42:18] Elisha I just want to kind of hit the
[42:23] high spots on this I'm gonna go quickly
[42:26] over this I'm not going to read
[42:27] everything I'm just going to use this as
[42:29] a point of reference but in Chapter 2 we
[42:34] find that Elijah is at the time that
[42:37] he's going to be taken up and so he
[42:40] takes Elijah Elijah with him we start at
[42:44] verse 1 of chapter 2 and it came to pass
[42:46] that when the Lord would
[42:48] take up Elijah into heaven by a
[42:50] whirlwind that Elijah went with Elijah
[42:54] to Gilgal and he like just said unto
[43:00] Elijah tarry here I pray thee for the
[43:04] LORD hath sent me to bettle and Elijah
[43:08] said unto him as the Lord liveth and as
[43:12] I so liveth I will not leave thee and so
[43:16] they went unto Bethel and so when they
[43:20] got to Bethel we find that there was a
[43:23] that there was a confrontation also that
[43:26] there was a school of prophets there but
[43:28] I say they were denominational believers
[43:30] but there was something striking about
[43:32] them that they knew that they had an
[43:34] understanding that this at this time
[43:36] that Elijah was going to be taken up and
[43:40] they came and they told Elijah they said
[43:44] look you know stay here with us join our
[43:47] group because you know after all your
[43:50] master is going to be taken away from
[43:52] your head today and we find that Elijah
[43:55] then he tells him mind your peace he
[44:01] said you're not telling me anything I
[44:04] don't already know so they were there
[44:07] were somehow there was a there was an
[44:08] understanding there was a revelation
[44:10] there was something that was happening
[44:12] that both the denominational group and
[44:15] the electro
[44:16] we're knowing the same thing I believe
[44:18] you would have to be spiritually know
[44:20] that there's that the that need the the
[44:25] the end of all things is right upon us I
[44:27] believe that you would have to be
[44:29] spiritually blind and and and completely
[44:33] ignorant of spiritual things to not know
[44:36] that the rapture is is is is upon us and
[44:39] and you got the denominational Czar
[44:41] saying it and you've got the
[44:42] independence that are saying it maybe
[44:44] they're not telling me anything I don't
[44:46] already know
[44:48] but the problem the difference is amen
[44:51] is home Amen do you got your eyes on
[44:54] they've got their eyes on their
[44:57] soothsayers and their dreamers in there
[44:58] and there
[44:59] visions and all these kind of things hey
[45:01] they're not telling me anything I don't
[45:02] already know
[45:03] I've been watching the time in the the
[45:05] word of a prophet they met for 36 plus
[45:08] years amen and he's been telling me keep
[45:10] your eye on the promise hallelujah
[45:16] but what we realize is that there's a
[45:18] message a man that comes with this
[45:21] catching away and without that messenger
[45:26] you will not see that rapture they'll be
[45:30] called away into great tribulation so he
[45:36] says you're not telling me anything I
[45:37] don't already know he said so just hold
[45:40] your peace in other words you haven't
[45:42] got a message that's going to get me in
[45:45] this rapture condition the only one
[45:48] that's got that is this elijah
[45:51] hallelujah and so the Bible says they
[45:54] went from there down to Jericho there
[45:56] they you know the the Prophet tells him
[46:00] because Elijah tells Elijah you know
[46:02] just wait here he said as the Lord
[46:04] liveth you know I'm not leave thee he
[46:07] takes him on he said I got to go to
[46:09] Jordan went to Jordan you know the story
[46:11] and brother Branham makes this statement
[46:15] here he said I don't care who you are I
[46:19] got the promise I'm going right on you
[46:24] say you know what the the pastor I don't
[46:27] care who you are I got my eye on the
[46:30] promise that's the way to get it
[46:33] keep your eye on the promise that's it
[46:37] stay with it hold on to it that's right
[46:40] listen now don't be jellyfish
[46:44] wishy-washy huh that's a that's a
[46:50] powerful vernacular right there huh
[46:54] that's literary genius don't be a
[46:58] jellyfish don't be wishy-washy how many
[47:02] times do we find in the Church of the
[47:03] Living God that people are wishy washy
[47:08] they're there in confusion they're going
[47:11] back and forth there's
[47:13] there's no there's no stability there's
[47:15] no steel in their backbone anymore
[47:18] oh I'll wash this way and I wish that
[47:20] way and I wish that way they'll wash
[47:23] that way well let me tell you the Bible
[47:26] says over in the book of James he said
[47:28] but let him ask in faith nothing
[47:30] wavering for he that wave earth is like
[47:34] a wave of the sea driven with the wind
[47:38] and tossed yes
[47:39] wishy-washy well let's not well I feel
[47:44] this way and I feel that way
[47:45] oh brother man said don't look at your
[47:47] symptoms look at Jonah he was down in
[47:51] the belly of a whale and his symptoms
[47:54] was all around him oh you talk about
[47:58] symptoms Billy I said that man had the
[48:02] first place he was back slidden the next
[48:04] place his hands and feet was tied behind
[48:06] him he was on a stormy sea the belly of
[48:08] the whale in the bottom of the sea and
[48:10] as he looked this way it was whale's
[48:12] belly he looked that way it was whales
[48:15] belly everywhere he looked was whales
[48:17] belly you talk about symptoms he had it
[48:21] there's nobody here in that condition
[48:23] tonight
[48:24] but What did he say he said they are all
[48:28] lying Vanity's I won't even look at him
[48:33] for the Bible says if you do you'll
[48:36] forsake your old mercy oh and where's
[48:39] she at my symptoms I'm washing out my
[48:42] circumstance oh I just look at this and
[48:44] look at that and what do you do you
[48:46] forsake your own mercy but the Bible
[48:50] says that he turned his face towards the
[48:53] temple but he turned over in vomit and
[48:58] seaweeds around his neck and belly in
[49:01] the belly of this whale and said Lord
[49:04] what's more I will look to your holy
[49:07] temple not to symptoms but at the temple
[49:12] he says why when Salomon dedicated the
[49:17] temple he prayed Lord if the people be
[49:19] in trouble at any time and look towards
[49:23] this holy place and pray then hear from
[49:27] Kevin and Jonah didn't add all those
[49:30] symptoms and call them lyin vanities
[49:33] watch because he had faith in the prayer
[49:39] of Solomon who dedicated that temple
[49:46] because he had he had been he was
[49:49] convinced he was convinced and then he
[49:53] was concerned and he knew that when that
[49:56] man prayed because God had ordained him
[50:00] to build that temple God had given him
[50:04] the instructions through his father
[50:06] David and he had the blueprints that was
[50:09] given by vision and David wrote those in
[50:12] those instructions down and gave them to
[50:16] Solomon and Solomon was operating on a
[50:18] super matte natural mandate on to build
[50:22] that temple and not only that but God
[50:25] had come behind that and gave Solomon a
[50:27] messiah sign had given him a gift of
[50:31] discernment and he was he was a voice of
[50:35] God for that day and that then and when
[50:38] when Jonah got in the situation that he
[50:41] was in he knew that if he would come
[50:44] back amen and then do what was on the
[50:47] tape even if he would come back and do
[50:50] maybe what God had said by his prophet
[50:52] messenger entering that God what set him
[50:55] free he kept his eye on the promise he
[50:58] knew what that masonic sign meant to him
[51:01] and he kept his eye on the prize
[51:03] both Church of the Living God if we
[51:07] could come tonight
[51:08] they better take what the prophet of God
[51:10] said and put our eye on that promise and
[51:13] not waver not be wishy-washy they better
[51:16] hold onto the the Bible says that he
[51:18] that does so say his life as a double
[51:21] minded man who is unstable in all of his
[51:23] ways or but I say God amen let me put my
[51:27] eye on the promise let me fix my face on
[51:30] it
[51:30] the Bible says like a flint amen that
[51:34] flint don't turn it don't turn right or
[51:36] left
[51:36] nothing but sparks come off you hit that
[51:39] that Flint
[51:40] it sparks a man it sets things on fire
[51:43] oh I say praise be to God let my face
[51:48] amen be like a flint and I'm not going
[51:52] to turn my life from the promise I want
[51:54] to be like Elijah and said as the Lord
[51:57] liveth I'm not gonna leave you I'm gonna
[52:00] keep my eye on this Elijah I'm gonna
[52:03] keep my eye on this message Amen I'm
[52:05] gonna keep my eye on what the messenger
[52:07] had to say I'm gonna follow it
[52:09] live or die I'm following it keeping my
[52:13] eye on the promise when they crossed
[52:16] over Jordan a man that old prophet took
[52:18] his mantle and struck the river Jordan
[52:21] the Bible says that the water went
[52:23] hither and thither and they walked
[52:25] across on dry ground oh it was just like
[52:28] in the days of Moses Amen when they went
[52:31] down through there sister Sarah amen and
[52:34] Moses came any raised up his staff
[52:36] through his nostrils amen and he blew in
[52:39] and they're in there and the this.c
[52:41] piled up on top of itself
[52:43] hey man and when he did the Bible says a
[52:46] minute wait a minute Sarah were talking
[52:48] about this today that the earth are deep
[52:49] underneath it congealed a man Oh
[52:53] hallelujah
[52:53] hey man he made a he made a super
[52:57] highway across that amen supernatural
[53:00] asphalt pavement hey man I made out of
[53:02] seashells and oh my is one of these one
[53:05] of these modern Oceanside highways and
[53:12] the children of Israel went way out on
[53:13] it and they went across that thing to
[53:16] million-strong
[53:17] oh my what was it that that God was
[53:24] showing Elijah and he was matching the
[53:28] old the old word that was in the Bible
[53:31] with the experience that he was getting
[53:34] brother Branham says that about the
[53:36] woman at the well that she began to
[53:38] match the old word with the experience
[53:41] that Jesus was given her he said when it
[53:44] did he said watch what happens quickly
[53:47] her sins were forgiven
[53:50] oh my you see what was happening aimin
[53:52] she came into a justified state she come
[53:55] underneath the messiah's of that day and
[53:58] that woman that was tainted on that in
[54:01] every way of her life she was she was
[54:04] married five times living with the six
[54:06] man oh what a what a an infidel you
[54:11] would say prostitute woman of ill Fame
[54:15] but instantly in the presence of Jesus
[54:19] Christ when she saw her day and it's
[54:21] mrs. quick paint her sins were forgiven
[54:24] those two pieces brother Graham said it
[54:27] was those two pieces of the laundry
[54:29] ticket that came together and she
[54:31] realized that she could be redeemed
[54:33] because she was redeemable from the
[54:36] beginning and there was Elijah and he
[54:40] saw the Old Testament amen being
[54:42] fulfilled right before his very eyes he
[54:44] saw that it was Jesus Christ the same
[54:47] yesterday today and forever and he knew
[54:49] that he was following the right message
[54:51] because the same words that their Moses
[54:54] did and Moses said the Lord your God
[54:56] shall raise up a prophet liken unto me
[54:59] hyrum you shall serve and now here he
[55:02] was a prophet was raised up with a
[55:04] Christ's ministry an anointing of Elijah
[55:11] hey man went for brother said the spirit
[55:14] of Elijah is the Spirit of Christ and so
[55:20] what did he do he saw his day he
[55:23] recognized his message and he kept his
[55:26] eye on that prophet also many want to
[55:30] turn you away from the Prophet and say
[55:32] that he wasn't here he wasn't there he
[55:34] was this or that or the other and try
[55:36] but all I can say is just push one play
[55:38] on one of them tapes and where brother
[55:40] man I'm standing there and telling that
[55:41] woman where she come from what was wrong
[55:43] with what was wrong with her husband and
[55:44] what was wrong with her stepdaughter
[55:47] not even a real daughter
[55:49] hello tell him where they were from they
[55:53] went from this city that was from
[55:55] another city he said and you say it's
[55:58] mine reading he said I don't know those
[56:00] people
[56:01] what was that it was a sign that was
[56:03] given to this last age there would only
[56:06] be given once to get the eyes of the
[56:11] people on the promise not on the man the
[56:16] man had faults and failures the man made
[56:19] mistakes I get that but the message that
[56:22] he sent brother Brown said it was a
[56:23] message of infallibility why because
[56:27] that message couldn't fail because it
[56:29] was Christ keep your eye on the promise
[56:44] when Solomon dedicated the temple the
[56:47] temple he prayed and said Lord if the
[56:51] people be in trouble at any time any
[56:57] place and under any circumstance didn't
[57:02] we have a messenger like that that come
[57:03] in this day a man What did he say the
[57:06] word works it cannot fail amen and when
[57:10] you under the inspiration of the Holy
[57:12] Spirit speak those words of God it is
[57:15] the same as if deity himself had spoken
[57:18] oh my friend when I know that I'm born
[57:22] again when I know I have the Holy Ghost
[57:24] down inside of my soul when I know
[57:26] beyond any shadow of a doubt that I'm a
[57:28] Christian and I love the Lord and I'm
[57:30] saved and if I die today hey man I'm
[57:33] gonna go to heaven that's why the scovia
[57:37] don't scare us
[57:38] it doesn't say doesn't scare God's
[57:41] children because they know Amen come
[57:43] what come well come what may you know
[57:47] you haven't you have is you have a
[57:48] better chance well I I don't like to say
[57:50] better you there there's a greater
[57:52] chance of you dying in an automobile
[57:54] accident and dying of kovat it's a truth
[57:59] run the statistics
[58:03] huh those weird I'm not afraid of dying
[58:05] in the car I mean I got I got I got here
[58:08] in one not too hot afraid of dying to
[58:11] covet if I get it and I die see on the
[58:16] other side there's no fear there why
[58:19] because my Bible says Amen that we don't
[58:22] fear or that we don't sorrow like those
[58:24] who have no hope we're not we're not
[58:27] like those that are that are that are
[58:29] that are without any any promise of a
[58:33] tomorrow so Satan can't can't can't
[58:37] strike us down with fear I'm not like
[58:40] the rest of this world it's out here in
[58:42] torment to me I think we give this covet
[58:51] way too much too much credit I think I
[58:53] think that's the thing to me the it's
[58:59] just a devil just like any other devil
[59:05] watch what he says here that at anytime
[59:10] and look towards this holy place and
[59:12] pray and hear from heaven and Jonah
[59:16] denied all those symptoms call them
[59:19] lying manatees because he had faith in
[59:23] the prayer of a man I don't know about
[59:30] you friends but brother Bram said that
[59:33] the hardest thing for God to do is to
[59:36] get one mortal to believe another one
[59:38] man to believe another all but here was
[59:41] a man that had the worst case of
[59:43] symptoms that I've ever seen one place
[59:47] the Bible says he was in hail I don't
[59:51] know if he wasn't even dead down there I
[59:53] don't know Jesus was dead every bit dead
[59:59] the body was scientifically I don't know
[1:00:04] how a man could live inside of a belly
[1:00:06] of a whale down there unless you believe
[1:00:09] in Pinocchio or something he got down in
[1:00:11] the belly of the whale one time that's
[1:00:13] just a fairy tale but at any rate
[1:00:15] whatever happened down here
[1:00:17] there for three days and three nights
[1:00:18] and the Bible says they went down he was
[1:00:22] in that he was in the in the Bell in
[1:00:23] there inhale inhale he lifted up his
[1:00:27] eyes the Bible says so I don't know what
[1:00:30] happened to him whether he physically
[1:00:31] was Dan Rafi was physically alive I
[1:00:33] don't know what was that going on down
[1:00:34] there but for whatever reason when the
[1:00:37] the days was up of the sign of Jonas was
[1:00:39] up because he was going to live out a
[1:00:42] prophecy of the resurrection of the Lord
[1:00:45] Jesus and so when that whether God put
[1:00:48] life back into him you can explain
[1:00:50] however you want to you know i whatever
[1:00:53] it was down there and that whale's belly
[1:00:55] when when God when it come time for him
[1:00:58] to come out he come out brilliant said
[1:01:02] that whale went up on the beach stuck
[1:01:03] his tongue out and he walked out on it
[1:01:05] like a gangplank and he walked out on
[1:01:08] the earth all no doubt it's three days
[1:01:11] in a whale's belly no telling what he
[1:01:13] looked like just a few hours in
[1:01:16] dishwater and my hands look terrible all
[1:01:18] shriveled up and everything I stay in
[1:01:21] the swimming pool for a long time when
[1:01:23] you go you get all pale and all
[1:01:25] shriveled up you know I'm talking about
[1:01:30] can you imagine what he looked like
[1:01:31] three days and whale vomit oh he must
[1:01:36] have been a sight but when he come out
[1:01:40] of there there was enough about him
[1:01:42] others quick and him power of God that
[1:01:44] he walked three days down into the
[1:01:46] middle of a city and caused a whole town
[1:01:48] to repent
[1:01:50] whatever it was why because he got his
[1:01:53] eyes off the symptoms and got his eyes
[1:01:57] on the prize he got his eyes off the the
[1:02:01] conditions he got his eyes off the
[1:02:03] corruption he got his eyes off of his
[1:02:05] own self they got his eyes off his own
[1:02:08] back slit condition he got his eyes off
[1:02:10] of his own inabilities Bream said he
[1:02:12] said the reason that he went down to
[1:02:14] tortious instead of going to Nineveh
[1:02:16] because he didn't believe he was that he
[1:02:18] had the ability to do it he was trusted
[1:02:22] in the arm of the flesh and the Bible
[1:02:24] says that's not wise to begin with and
[1:02:26] so when he got down there and got
[1:02:30] that boat oh my got a good preaching
[1:02:33] around that Jonah in the boat but let me
[1:02:38] tell you when he got out of there and
[1:02:42] got where God was supposed when he was
[1:02:43] supposed to go in the first place and he
[1:02:46] got his eyes on the promise that the
[1:02:50] thing that God told him he was going to
[1:02:51] do with him to begin with God did it and
[1:02:54] so much so that Jonah got upset he got
[1:03:00] upset he said you did what you said you
[1:03:02] were gonna do Lord and now what I guess
[1:03:13] Oh Jonah wanted him to get destroyed oh
[1:03:19] my we shouldn't take that approach you
[1:03:23] know there's a lot of people out there
[1:03:25] that that are really afraid there's a
[1:03:29] lot there's people out there they're
[1:03:30] really afraid of these things they're
[1:03:32] afraid of these this violence or afraid
[1:03:34] of all the you know these these race
[1:03:36] things and they're afraid of all these
[1:03:38] disease things and they're afraid of all
[1:03:40] these things there's any comfort
[1:03:44] you'll be it to many people
[1:03:47] do your best to comfort amen whoever you
[1:03:50] can watch this when as we get ready to
[1:03:57] close
[1:03:57] he said if Jonah could do that upon them
[1:04:01] circumstances what are we to do who
[1:04:07] don't look at solomon's temple but to
[1:04:10] heaven itself where Jesus sets at the
[1:04:14] right hand of God with his own promise
[1:04:17] to make intercessions upon our
[1:04:20] confession symptoms certainly not we
[1:04:26] deny them there's no such thing think
[1:04:32] about that we take God at His Word keep
[1:04:37] our eye
[1:04:38] on the promise and move on oh I think
[1:04:44] that's good advice tonight friends amen
[1:04:48] we deny the symptoms we deny the
[1:04:51] circumstances we deny them they don't
[1:04:54] exist they don't belong to us I'm not
[1:04:57] signing for him my brother Jules says
[1:04:58] I'm giving them rattlesnakes back I
[1:05:00] don't want them I'm not signing for him
[1:05:03] and because they don't exist in my mind
[1:05:04] they don't exist and then I'm gonna keep
[1:05:10] take God at His Word keep my eye on the
[1:05:13] promise and move on let's stand to our
[1:05:20] feet this evening
[1:05:28] some musicians return
[1:05:36] a little challenge maybe from this
[1:05:38] evening no doubt we have many more
[1:05:42] things that we could say but I just felt
[1:05:44] like the Lord kind of clinched that
[1:05:46] thought on the other side that maybe
[1:05:50] there's a neat or something that we need
[1:05:52] to pray about this evening we many many
[1:05:55] requests and brother Matt will bring
[1:06:00] those before you but maybe there's a
[1:06:04] special need here this evening you need
[1:06:06] prayer be glad to pray with you pray for
[1:06:08] you so we go to him this evening maybe
[1:06:13] that need is not something physical but
[1:06:17] something in that spiritual room that
[1:06:23] spiritual realm is the Bible says that
[1:06:26] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[1:06:28] but against powers principalities and
[1:06:32] spiritual wickedness in high places but
[1:06:36] man said the highest place on earth is
[1:06:39] the heart of man and so maybe you're
[1:06:42] you're wrestling with something in your
[1:06:45] your breasts tonight something on your
[1:06:49] heart that's just troubled troubled on
[1:06:52] every side the Bible says but we sing
[1:06:55] that little chorus as I came to the
[1:06:57] platform cover me cover me when all
[1:07:02] seems hopeless cover me when my strength
[1:07:08] has gone maybe tonight you just been
[1:07:11] fighting this thing and wrestling with
[1:07:14] it maybe it's someone out on the
[1:07:16] on the livestream tonight and you're
[1:07:18] struggling your heart is troubled on
[1:07:22] every side and you wonder how you're
[1:07:25] even gonna make it through another day
[1:07:30] you just feel that you're just tired of
[1:07:34] fighting this thing maybe it's a
[1:07:36] physical thing but maybe it's a
[1:07:38] spiritual thing we don't know I'm not
[1:07:41] just guessing I'm I'm I'm not just
[1:07:45] throwing out thoughts or maybes or
[1:07:48] what-ifs out there I I'm just a man I

[1:15:38] oh and then we want to take up the
[1:15:41] prayer requests that we have brother
[1:15:43] Luther we gathering on Wednesday up here
[1:15:45] distancing her to stay there what have
[1:15:48] we been doing staying gathering come on
[1:15:51] up front then hey man I got the
[1:15:53] permission from the Deacons so Amen just
[1:15:56] make your way with your family amen if
[1:15:58] you need to use just come close so that
[1:16:01] we can make sure we do this properly
[1:16:04] amen
[1:16:05] boy I appreciated the word tonight Amen
[1:16:08] did you appreciate that Amy give the
[1:16:10] Lord a hand clap of praise my goodness
[1:16:15] it was just so encouraging to me
[1:16:17] Amen I've looked at that same thing by
[1:16:19] the dáil deal with Jonah personally my
[1:16:21] opinion is he did die I have that
[1:16:24] opinion you know Jesus said it was the
[1:16:27] sign of Jonas who was in the belly of
[1:16:29] the whale the depths of hell and she
[1:16:30] hold for three days and and I believe
[1:16:33] that there were the miracle was the fact
[1:16:36] that you know not just the fact that he
[1:16:38] was in a Wells belly but that God rose
[1:16:40] him back up again I could be wrong I do
[1:16:42] know this and what got me tonight just
[1:16:44] that one part by the dáil amen
[1:16:46] appreciated the whole sermon there but
[1:16:49] what got me there was Jonah's reaction
[1:16:52] and you know the reason why he had that
[1:16:54] reaction I was struggled to remember the
[1:16:56] nation Nineveh wasn't just Ninevites but
[1:16:59] it was a nation that hated Israel and
[1:17:02] remember reading this just a week ago
[1:17:03] and Jonah and all honesty really when
[1:17:07] you look at the story he wanted them
[1:17:09] wiped off the face of the planet I mean
[1:17:11] because that's what God said God said if
[1:17:13] they don't repent I'm gonna wipe him out
[1:17:16] and so Jonah you know that's really what
[1:17:19] he wanted to happen he was ready to just
[1:17:21] commit suicide you know when he when it
[1:17:23] was all said and done it was just
[1:17:24] brokenhearted that God and God had to
[1:17:26] correcting and you know what it showed
[1:17:29] me I remember looking at this last just
[1:17:31] a week ago what it showed me is you know
[1:17:34] this world that we live in hates what we
[1:17:37] believe
[1:17:39] they hate Christianity now I'm not
[1:17:41] talking about I'm talking about the
[1:17:43] secular world they hate what you stand
[1:17:45] for they hate the faith that you have in
[1:17:47] your heart they hate your confession
[1:17:48] they hate your lifestyle because you are
[1:17:51] opposed you are against everything that
[1:17:55] they stand for their agenda and they've
[1:17:58] got an agenda and so they they mock us
[1:18:01] they mock the cross they mock believers
[1:18:05] and you know what the day of reckoning
[1:18:07] is coming
[1:18:08] God will judge the just and the unjust
[1:18:11] and but you know what let me say this so
[1:18:14] many times we get that in the heart but
[1:18:15] let me tell you we can become so affixed
[1:18:18] on judgment that we forget God is
[1:18:20] long-suffering we say Lord why is that
[1:18:23] why is you know he said scoffers what am
[1:18:26] I saying where's the promise of your
[1:18:27] coming and and and we say Lord what's
[1:18:30] going on you know how much more do they
[1:18:33] have to mock you and hate you before you
[1:18:35] just wipe them off you know but just as
[1:18:37] brother Branham was shown that blood
[1:18:39] strip that went all the way around
[1:18:41] showed his own sins and his own heart
[1:18:43] and I believe the Lord is long-suffering
[1:18:45] he's not willing that any should perish
[1:18:47] but that all should come to life and so
[1:18:50] he's not fixed on judgment that day is
[1:18:52] coming but right now there's still mercy
[1:18:54] there's still grace amen and so if
[1:18:57] they're still mercy and grace for me how
[1:18:59] much more we should extend that mercy
[1:19:01] and grace for others amen you know that
[1:19:04] that video we played last Wednesday I
[1:19:06] just got a few questions even about that
[1:19:09] and you know I said they said by the mat
[1:19:10] what do you what is your I thought I
[1:19:12] made it clear Wednesday and I said well
[1:19:14] I truly believe you know God could use
[1:19:17] that that man that Dana Dana Coverstone
[1:19:20] to give him a dream you know he used
[1:19:22] Abimelech gave him a dream gay pilots
[1:19:24] wife has dreams we use last Wednesday
[1:19:26] but that's not our message our message
[1:19:29] isn't go and quit our jobs our message
[1:19:30] isn't going by guns and and stockpile
[1:19:33] and canned goods we're getting out of
[1:19:35] here we're not gonna hear and we're not
[1:19:37] gonna be here before the first bomb
[1:19:39] Falls God will come there will be a
[1:19:41] secret setting catching away but is that
[1:19:44] a message maybe it's for the fullest
[1:19:45] version maybe it's to tell them to brace
[1:19:47] yourself
[1:19:48] you know while there say embrace
[1:19:50] yourself God say and get ready a man in
[1:19:53] the Bible says his bride hath made
[1:19:55] herself ready and so they're bracing
[1:19:58] ourselves I'm bracing myself and the
[1:20:00] world's changing and I'm about to change
[1:20:02] too and I really believe that that's not
[1:20:04] hype that's not hyperbole that's not pep
[1:20:07] rally that's the truth that's what I
[1:20:09] believe that's the assurance I have in
[1:20:11] my soul a change is coming this world's
[1:20:13] about to change and the bride is about
[1:20:15] to take a change amen and if anything it
[1:20:18] should do you know maybe maybe even that
[1:20:21] that dream that that man had would shake
[1:20:23] a believer if it would be God would use
[1:20:25] just to shake someone to their senses
[1:20:27] because I believe just like I do we all
[1:20:30] need to be shaken sometimes amen thank
[1:20:32] you brother Dale for that and that was
[1:20:33] wonderful
[1:20:34] keep your eyes on the promise amen give
[1:20:37] the Lord another hand keep your eyes on
[1:20:42] the word believe God could use a man so
[1:20:45] what brother Branham said he said when
[1:20:47] you said it's exactly what I was
[1:20:48] thinking the Prophet said the one of the
[1:20:50] hardest things God could get you to do
[1:20:52] is believe another man using the human
[1:20:54] agency think about the Jews
[1:20:56] man when jeho when it was God revealed
[1:20:59] in Jehovah no one want anything to do
[1:21:00] with him then when God revealed himself
[1:21:02] into Christ they all wanted to cling to
[1:21:04] Jehovah and reject the man Christ and
[1:21:06] now Christ is gone direct Christ is you
[1:21:09] know died and ascended and now they
[1:21:11] reject the current Living Word of the
[1:21:13] hour
[1:21:14] and that's the that's Christ in his body
[1:21:17] man never has a problem accepting God as
[1:21:21] a thought a picture book a coloring book
[1:21:24] a story a historical but we always have
[1:21:27] trouble believing God could use the
[1:21:29] agency of man but I'm so glad God used
[1:21:32] the agency of a prophet and sent him a
[1:21:34] vindicated word amen are you good are
[1:21:38] you grateful for that
[1:21:39] amen and that's what we should keep our
[1:21:41] eyes on is the word and then we have
[1:21:43] some prayer requests we want to take
[1:21:44] before you continue prayer for our
[1:21:47] sister Karen Pruitt for a full recovery

[1:28:48] I just want to publicly thank the Lord
[1:28:50] for healing me from melanoma cancer and
[1:28:53] as a week ago I had an update with the
[1:28:56] doctor and he did a physical exam we
[1:28:58] were the tumor was gone after the first
[1:29:01] treatment it was gone but then I was
[1:29:06] still waiting for the lymph nodes to to
[1:29:10] reduce because they were still inflamed
[1:29:12] and enlarged and a week ago the physical
[1:29:16] exam all the lymph nodes were normal so
[1:29:20] I just have to praise the Lord I have
[1:29:30] three testimonies one of them it's going
[1:29:34] to go from the simplest to the the best
[1:29:36] anyway I was sleeping in my office
[1:29:40] today and that usually I don't sleep
[1:29:42] very well but I slept like 40 minutes
[1:29:44] and then I woke up about one o'clock and
[1:29:46] I called this guy that I had to do some
[1:29:49] work for wanted some information and the
[1:29:52] first thing he said when he picked up
[1:29:53] the phone he said tell me something good
[1:29:55] and I was like Jesus Christ the same
[1:29:58] yesterday saying forever is the first
[1:29:59] thing you come out of my mouth and I he
[1:30:01] goes well ain't nothing can top that but
[1:30:04] I was just caught unawares when I was
[1:30:08] traveling in Phoenix on the way home
[1:30:12] whatever but I went through security
[1:30:16] he got checked out and everything in the
[1:30:17] way they had a setup he had to go
[1:30:19] through the see security gate and I'm
[1:30:21] over on addy thing D gate so I go all
[1:30:24] the way down there and I sit down and
[1:30:25] then I'm like well I had about an hour
[1:30:27] and a half for my flight left so I
[1:30:29] wanted to get something to eat and when
[1:30:30] I've got something to eat and then I sat
[1:30:32] over where the desk was so I could see
[1:30:34] the lady come up so I'm flying standby
[1:30:35] and I wanted to check in earlier you
[1:30:38] check in more likely you're gonna be one
[1:30:40] of the first standbys that gets a flight
[1:30:42] so I go up there and I give him my
[1:30:45] security pass thing she goes you have
[1:30:46] your ID and I always have my stuff in
[1:30:51] order and everything you know
[1:30:52] I'm like mushing and half like and I
[1:30:55] pull out my wallet and I'm like and you
[1:30:57] get I'm starting to I can feel I'm
[1:30:59] starting to get nervous and sudden I'm
[1:31:00] like relax relax I'm like no I don't
[1:31:03] have it on me I go look at my luggage
[1:31:05] and everything and I'm like oh my
[1:31:07] goodness I'm like no I don't have it I
[1:31:10] lost it and so she goes we can go back
[1:31:13] to the security which is like you know
[1:31:14] the quarter-mile and and so I get all my
[1:31:17] stuff I got my food and this that I'm
[1:31:19] gonna bring a little thing in about the
[1:31:21] food but I I put it all back in the bag
[1:31:23] and I'm like I'm looking as I'm going
[1:31:25] back to security and then I get back
[1:31:28] there and I ask the supervisor says do
[1:31:31] you have an ID here or anything he's
[1:31:32] like no we don't but you can walk over
[1:31:35] there and look at everything some look
[1:31:36] I'm going every place I've been you know
[1:31:37] and I go over there and I look and I'm
[1:31:39] like man I'm not finding this thing you
[1:31:41] know and the whole time I'm like just
[1:31:44] calm down relax and so I turn around I
[1:31:48] go all the way back down to my gate and
[1:31:49] I'm like where I sat before I got my
[1:31:53] food there was two people sitting then I
[1:31:55] look under the seat and I'm like there's
[1:31:57] my license and I walked over that's as I
[1:32:00] excuse me I got to get my ID and so I
[1:32:03] was very thankful for that course then
[1:32:05] everything went calm cool and collected
[1:32:07] but the food thing my salad went
[1:32:11] sideways my dressing went all over in
[1:32:12] the bag and everything but the best we
[1:32:18] prayed for a woman at Bluffton library
[1:32:21] her name was Kathy and she had breast
[1:32:24] cancer and you know we we told I told
[1:32:27] her we'd pray for her and everything and
[1:32:29] I talked to her today I love this woman
[1:32:32] she she's just such a nice nice person
[1:32:35] and I said so how's it going with it and
[1:32:38] she said it's all gone and she just has
[1:32:41] to go every three months for an
[1:32:42] evaluation so that was the cherry on the
[1:32:45] top praise the Lord
[1:32:50] anybody else one more time for nobody
[1:32:54] where's Charles no you know how we take
[1:33:01] the prayer requests and lot of times you
[1:33:05] know if you're Watkins you do it
[1:33:07] digitally and but at the home Church
[1:33:12] there we've been they've been coming in
[1:33:14] a little paper slips that we write the
[1:33:17] prayer requests on and and they way they
[1:33:20] collect underneath the podium there and
[1:33:22] I just got this inspiration of the day
[1:33:27] and I gathered up I probably had 15
[1:33:31] prayer requests that were under the
[1:33:33] podium and some that we're in always
[1:33:35] stick him in my Bible and I go back
[1:33:38] through them later and and what more but
[1:33:40] that particular Sunday morning I believe
[1:33:43] it was I just gathered them all up and I
[1:33:46] just in my mind I thought how many of
[1:33:49] these have been answered and I went
[1:33:52] through them I just want to testify
[1:33:54] every prayer request that I had in my
[1:33:57] BOB there had to be at least 15 on that
[1:33:59] round and that was slips of paper every
[1:34:02] single one of them the Lord had answered
[1:34:04] I and I just said you know so many times
[1:34:07] we bring the prayer requests but then do
[1:34:09] we come back and now you know I don't
[1:34:11] ever want to be like them that the tenth
[1:34:14] you know or the nine that didn't come
[1:34:16] back but the one came back and praise
[1:34:17] the Lord and so I just want to praise
[1:34:19] God in many answers in every request
[1:34:22] every request
[1:34:27] praise God
[1:34:29] thankful for parents and God we're gonna
[1:34:31] let you go he's got it all in control

[1:34:56] in prayer so remember them amen we're
[1:34:59] gonna get the victory but just I know
