are facing many weeks perhaps of recovery and um a lot of Devastation in the northern part of the I should say the mountainous areas of North Carolina amen those Western areas and through Tennessee they've had had a almost a Biblical flooding it's just been uh just terrible to watch but yet I speaking to brother Dany down there in Florida brother Danny steeman spoke to brother Donnie also this morning and uh no loss of life and and and so far as I know even no great loss of property or anything like that for the Believers amen so we're happy for that amen praise God brother uh Brad and Sister Sarah Sarah and brother Jackson were amen there in that Park and I I was praying for them all night and brother Brad was sitting up as if that would have done any good but we do that anyway and um and so we were praying and they were praying and all through the night you know the wind was howling and it even made me a little uneasy amen so um we're just thankful for the Lord Sister Sarah sent me a video of the next day and the Sun bright and shining and it's like a a bunch of trees had fallen and if You' seen the video I don't know if you've seen it yet if you haven't asked Sister Sarah to show it to you it just looks like that all the trees just fell in a ring around their home and not even one tree fell right beside it and didn't touch it amen so we're we're rejoicing with them this morning Amen brother Aaron and sister Ruth amen they actually um their neighborhood they couldn't escape it uh without all the neighborhood men going out with chainsaws and opening things up many roofs torn off uh whole areas and swaths of parks and and Forest just laid low but brother Aaron's Home was spared and had one tree across the driveway and was able to cut that up amen so I think we found a generator for them they're going to be without power for a couple of weeks so you know who to be praying for amen praise the Lord amen sister Martha and her and Jonathan are still out without powers of this morning hey honey so glad to see her and the family amen ready to be at the house of God regardless amen praise the Lord we're just happy amen some still without power praise

uh upgrades to our video it was already pretty amazing uh but they made some further adjustments we uh were working now I thought that they had fixed the sound issue we've been having a sound issue with it cutting in and out different ones are reporting that just just for the streaming audience please understand we know about it thank you for the reports we continue to look for your feedback it's helpful to us but we are working on that brother Matt was spent a lot of Midnight Oil uh the last couple days trying to work on that was here last night uh till near midnight working on it there he's back there monitoring today and so we're trying to isolate that issue and we're going to try to get that fixed I want to make a brief announcement because I'm already getting questions about our youth camp coming up in three and a half weeks and uh we are right now behind the scenes making sure that the Carolina Point Youth campgrounds uh will be good to go and we are trusting the Lord for that so that's going on behind the scenes as well for anyone listening anyone wondering um if you've got that question I've been asked that question already and so yes we are behind the scenes making sure that Carolina point will be up and running and all the roads to it uh are will be serviceable amen will you pray and and ask the Lord we're just trusting the Lord that that is true amen praise the Lord I had I didn't get a um maybe I did here um no I didn't get a um bro it's two inches for sure okay brother Matt chastising me from the back amen praise the Lord okay that'll be have to be as

will help him and so he managed to get to The Specialist and they said boy you got here just in time so we're happy in the Lord we want the Lord to continue to help our brother amen sister Brenda is abroad in Italy and uh we want you to be remembering her she's over there visiting her daughter who paid her way to go over and her her and her husband are on assignment there um sister Joyce her mom is in the hospital facing uh heart cath tomorrow sister Debbie and I are going to plan at some point this afternoon maybe in the late afternoon after this the fellowship and what more we'll go up and visit her and pray with her and I might be able to be there in the morning I don't know what time it's going to be they don't she don't even know so just be praying for sister Joyce sister Brenda as you can imagine has been quite worried about that amen praise God Amen let's stand back to our feet I think that's all the announcements that I had amen let's turn to Daniel chapter 8 this morning we want to continue with our series on opposing the Judgment of heaven today I think should be the fifth installment amen we want to try to turn a corner today on this thought and um I think you'll understand that better as I get going and and I've got some statements I'll make that I really should should clarify it pretty good amen it's one it's one thing to present a problem but it's that's only adds weariness if you don't have a solution amen so I like to be anytime I'm in a situation I like to be part of the solution not part of the problem amen amen praise the Lord so today we want to start looking toward we want to continue to address the situation but we've talked quite a bit about what's hindering the world and today I want to start talking about you know what is hindering us and what is the answer for us and we won't get through it today but I'll go just so far and then we'll amen we'll we'll jump out pop the Shute stand on the brakes get it landed amen praise the Lord Daniel chapter 8 verse 13 and we'll go 13 through 19 then I heard one speaking and another Saint said unto that certain Saint which spake how long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trotten underfoot and he said unto me unto 2,300 days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed and it came to pass when I even I Daniel had seen the vision and sought for the meaning then behold there stood before me as the appearance of a man and I heard a man's voice between the banks of Uli which called and said Gabriel make this man to understand the vision so he came near Where I Stood and when he came I was afraid and fell upon my face but he said unto me understand oh son of man for at the time of the end shall the vision be now as he was speaking with me I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground but he touched me and set me upright and he said behold I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation for at the time appointed the end shall be Daniel chapter 10 verses 7-2 Daniel 10 7-12 and I Daniel alone saw the vision for the men that were with me saw not the vision but a great quaking fell upon them so that they fled to hide themselves therefore I was left alone and saw this great vision and there remained no strength in me for my caless was turned in me into corruption and I retained no strength yet heard I the voice of his words and when I heard the voice of his words then was I in a deep sleep on my face and my face toward the ground and behold a hand touched me which sat me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands and he said unto me oh Daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that I speak unto thee and stand upright For unto thee am I now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me I stood trembling then said he unto me fear not Daniel for from from the first day that thou did US set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy God thy words were heard and I am come for thy words let's pray father we're asking for your great blessing today upon your word may you break to us the bread of life Lord we realize that we are in a tumultuous time and Lord we know that the that the events that are unfolding around the world cannot be stopped so Lord we want to know what are our orders Lord what is our position that we ought to be in and need to be in Father for this gripping time in human history we commit ourselves into your hands now to study your word and look at these things in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated amen Smith Wigglesworth once said to hunger and thirst after righteousness is when nothing nothing in the world can Fascinate us so much as being near God I think that is a profound way to say it want to read it again this is a great champion of the faith great um he was among and you know at the tail end of the isua Revival there and was a powerful voice in that time he preceded um brother Brandon by some years and in fact is as he was fading out and going off the scene uh in and near that time brother Brandon was uh receive a message a commission from an angel to go forward Wigglesworth says again to hunger and thirst after righteousness would you like to know what that is to hunger and thirst after righteousness here's the definition is when nothing in the world can Fascinate us so much as being near God it's like that there are advantages to living in the spiritual world and I have a lot of things that brother brandom said I don't know that I'll get to any of them today my my my job as I see it today is to try to deliver to you the burden of the word that's on my heart not try to press beyond that uh so you just pray for me amen I would like to say that the these things that I'm saying today are very near my own heart and when I say that I don't just mean for you but I mean for me as well I I I it's partly why this this statement so spoke to me uh because with such a great desire as I have to live higher in the Lord I hope you have that desire and I as I see the world ending I coming to a conclusion it's not ending it's not ending but it's coming into a transition and so as we see that happening and we know that it can't be stopped that we know as I've said before that there are uh enormous judgments that are rushing to meet humanity and the only way out is up that is still true that will not change and the only way that you will ever hear the word come up is if you are willing to hear the word come out and so you have to come out of her my people if you want to hear the word come up high amen so I want to hear come out which means I don't just want to hear it I want to do it I want to be it I want to experience what it means to be separated from the world and I say brother Jason but you're a Christian you had you're correct I have been for many years but I find as I see the world falling under the grip of Satan more and more and more as I see the judgments that are burgeoning all around us uh it causes me to want to move up even higher brother brandham said in the message perfect faith and I'm going to be dealing with that a lot today and you're going to understand why momentarily but the prophet warned us that one of the reasons he was bringing the message perfect faith is because you were going to need it down the road and in when in his day you know him thinking that it was imminent and about as bad as it could get oh boy H how any of us would like to go back to the Simplicity of the mid 1960s but I now I don't want to go back I'm this close to home I want to keep going amen I've already come too far to turn back or go back I want to go forward amen and so and so I realize you know and then young people sometimes say well you know I want to before uh this you know before the Rapture I'd like to accomplish this I'd like to accomplish that I'd like to have this or have that just take my word for it I get that I thought that way as a young man but I'm here to tell you I once was young now I'm older and I'm here to tell you that uh when when when we cross over you won't worry about what you didn't get to accomplish in this life amen it's it's that it's it's I heard one man describing it is imagine if you existed as a two-dimensional black and white image on the wall and that's all your existence was you you were just an a picture in black and white two-dimensional and then suddenly somebody came and gave you the breath of life and pulled you out into a three-dimensional world with color and life and then you have to go try to go back into that 2D black and white picture and then try to describe to everybody in that realm what you just experienced brother bam said there are no words I can't describe that feeling there's I don't have enough vocabulary in the English language he said just take my word for it just beyond this breath just beyond this breath just beyond this little thin veil friends is a world waiting that is beyond all imagination your heart has never even entertained what God has for those that love him I want to be part of that see and I don't just want to stumble in I don't want to trip and fall in I don't want to arrive there accidentally I don't want to be trying to rush you know I I I know that the bride was getting out of Step at the end and I'm glad that she was still in an order of ascending even stumbling cuz that gives me hope and I do know you say why because I do know I Stumble and I do know I get out of Step but I do know I'm still ascending but what I want to do is obey a prophet's words he said when I came out of the vision I was standing out the middle of the room with my hands out saying stay in line and that's what I want to do and he said the last thing I saw is those little girls at the end were hurrying trying to get get back in Step I just say Lord God let me get back in Step let my whole life be in Step so there's a lot to be said about having perfect Faith so when we when we talk about living in a realm near God you know I I cannot stress enough and there's so many things from uh Great Men of God that I read not just William Brandon but great men of God down Through the Ages who talked in such detail and if you uh you know you you would always do yourself good to read some of their writings and some of their sermons and you know I love my my uh Bible that Rachel got me um because uh it's a spurge it's edited by Spurgeon and has his own handwritten notes in it things like that I love reading stuff like that I read from people like Wigglesworth from Spurgeon from Gil from Henry all the way back to the and Wesley and in the different ones my library is quite large and so but but I can tell you as a as a one who studies as a student of History particularly church history I can tell you that they all these Great Men of God down through William brandham all the way down into the Great Men of God we have today preaching in pulpits around the world preaching this glorious messag amen that they the common theme among them all if there's one common theme they lived in different countries they lived in different times sometimes they spoke different languages sometimes it was English and they lived you know when you go and you go read The Works of Hudson Taylor or you go and you look at David Livingston and different ones and I've also read their lives and the Memoirs of Wesley in his own hand and I can tell you that the one common theme they all pointed to was there was Grand privilege when you were willing to live in the upper atmospheres in the presence of God there were many you had great access and many doors open to you that would not otherwise open uh if you don't as the Bible says walk in the spirit move in the spirit live in the spirit see and so when you do when you are willing to do that then then there are all kinds of places of peace and contentment and power that become open and available to you how many want that that total satisfaction of life that are that I let me say it like this that are not accessible to you if you don't live in this realm of the spirit of God's presence you you will you will know let me say you will know very little of the enjoyment even may I say even if you are a child of God and even if you have had the personal experience of the holy ghost in a new birth if if you're not willing to press your way daily and live and enjoy some time with the Lord in his presence then I'm here to tell you something friends you are you are really missing out on a lot and you are suffering a lot of anxiousness worry frat fear anxiety uh and let me just say it today I know that life is filled with that and I'm not denying that we have trials and we live by the law of contrast I understand that but I can also tell you that you are living a great portion of that anxiety needlessly Hallelujah do you believe that today I'm here to tell you that his promise is that he would give you a peace that passes understanding what that means is it's it it's it you have a peace that even you can't explain to you that everything around you seems bad and dull and terrible but somehow you lay your pillow on your head at night and you love God and God loves you and you wake up every morning and you feel him near and the trial may not be gone but you know you're not in it alone amen even if you are I want to say it again there is great accessibility to you if you live in that spirit but you will be very limited though you be a child of God though you may have had a holy ghost experience you will be limited with little enjoyment of those benefits uh because you invest so much of your very oh my wish I had another language because you invest so much of your very limited time here Amen in spiritual things see instead we invest so much come on we might as well own it we invest when I when I said to myself why don't I live higher I had to come to terms with this maybe it's because I'm spending too much of my very limited time with the cares of the world I'm not talking about sinful carnal things I'm just talking about World stuff and you get wrapped up in that and you get wrapped up in the technology and where is the time spent with the Lord where's the time with your Bible open as sister Emily sings uh on the back porch with a Bible on my knee a cup of coffee I'm here to tell you th those words were written from somebody who was experiencing that amen there's such a a fountain that you can open for yourself you know I I looked at a study and I'm don't have it in front of me today in fact it is not in my notes I'm just remembering it now but there was a St study about just simple Bible reading when they asked brother brandham how can we be closer to God and his answer was almost overs simplistic and people just say okay yeah but what's the real answer and that was the real answer read your Bible and pray and they they talked about Christian people who only read their Bible once per week yeah one day a week they read in their Bible and the the the the effect of that was not measurable it was so small it was not measurable amen then they started looking at people and they and they're having people fill out you know questionnaires about you know your your mental state and the condition of your heart and your you know and all it was all it was all it was a psychology exam and so they they found that you know and and that's important because we can't just always live up there in the ethereals of great revelation we do got to live and your feet have to contact the Earth and sometimes you just need the old sassr rubber meets the road kind of preaching that tells you how to be an overcomer and how to deal with anxiety there's a way to do it and it's a disease that the world is dealing with brother brandham called it a plague called it a plague that we live under see and so so we they found out that if a if a Christian read their Bible two times in a week that finally the needle bumped just a a little bit and if they read their Bible three times a week three days if they read their Bible three days a week see not just three times but three days a week they spent time in their Bible that finally the needle actually got up off the the nothing Peg and and actually got up into a little bit of low range and they found a surprising reality that if for those who read their Bible four days a week there was an exponential explosion and the peg went way over and all it took was that extra day little as much you say it's just one more day little as much if God is in it I can tell you that reading your Bible and praying has a cumulative effect in your life as does not reading your Bible and praying every day has an accumulative drain on our lives and this is no time to be drained this is a time to be on fire this is time to have power this is a time to have peace and Tranquility overcoming the anxieties of the world settling disputes making homes and families and marriages live in harmony because everything in the world that's falling apart is trying to make that fall apart absolutely you know this is exactly why there should be such Purity but you know between men and women before marriage because I will promise you this young people hear me the same devil that is trying to put you two together in a way that shouldn't be before you're married is the same exact devil that will come the day after your wedding and try to drive you apart the same one who's trying to put you together unlawful in God's word will be the same guy who shows up the very next day trying to start driving you apart see amen so so we find then that that we can no little enjoyment of these great things even even if we are as I said true children of God I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt today you're a true child of God you've had an experience hopefully you've had many experiences with the Holy Ghost see but if we invest so much uh so much of our limited time in the cares of this world you do know it's dying right amen amen you do know that right see it's passing away friends it it's being renewed under a new headship the Millennium I want to tell you something the Millennium is just upon us all we are to be glad and rejoice the Millennium is just upon us what a tragic and sad loss of privilege it is for a son or daughter of God Called to be children of God called to be children of this great king who is going to rule and Reign from his throne in the Millennium the world won't end it's going to come under new headship amen and Christ will reign from the throne and his royal family will be the executiv of his will they will be the dispensers of his Justice and his laws I'm here to tell you the world this Earth is going to be a grand place oh Hallelujah think about it no more smut and no more gum and no more sin and no more nothing to bring alarm or fear all weapons of war will be become Farming tools and there will be peace and True Justice throughout the world see so it becomes such a tragic loss as Sons and Daughters of God when we're called to live under this great King's Dominion now that you're being trained now for your life there then which isn't very far away yet yet living here we are Sons and Daughters of the great king and yet we live so far below our privileges you know I I have been speaking and now let me try to bring some clarity to my thought so you'll see what I'm aiming at today I've been speaking on the title of this series opposing the Judgment of Heaven we've dealt with it in four previous installments I was in Louisiana preaching a version of it uh kind of a mixed bag of of some of the things about it still was still burning on my heart and I'm I'm coming today because I I want to I want to turn a corner and I want I want to come with this question if if we have the world and I think I've proved it by the Bible and by world events that they are opposing the Judgment of Heaven in every way I don't have it in front of me here today I was going to get it and I thought about playing the clip and then I thought about transcribing it and just reading it but I'm trying to save some time we might get to it later but just a synopsis of it the the Secretary General of the United Nations just recently a few days some days ago gave a speech and and I wouldn't have paid a whole lot of attention to it if he was just a talking head so we got the world's full of them and everybody's got an opinion but this is the Secretary General of the UN and he's speaking globally for the 10 96 or two or four eight whatever Nations it let just around 200 Nations over the world and he's he comes to the podium and he begins to address all of these national leaders and their and their uh representatives and he he says almost his opening line is that the world is facing multiple crisis that it has never before seen amen that caught my attention this isn't just this isn't just somebody on the street corner holding up a sign this is a man who's in the know this is a man who's in those back rooms behind closed doors this is a man who's dealing with all of those ambassadors and trying to trying to find the middle ground and he's actually announcing to the world probably about 70 years late but he's announcing to the world we're facing times and threats the world has never known and he goes on to say that is not sustainable and he's not wrong it is not sustainable and it won't be sustained he he he he comes with a a faint hope that if we act now and if we act decisively and if we come together as one then we can Stave off the the coming uh catastrophe the problem that I felt pity for that man he seemed like a very nice man if I ever got an opportunity to tell him I wouldn't want to take hope away don't take Hope from people but I would like to point out that the problem with that is a problem that William bradam saw all the way back in the League of Nations and in the United Nations and it can't work it's a good idea they have well many of them have good motives and objectives but it can't work because it's a it's a 2 nations of unregenerate people and it's represented by leadership that do not have the new birth are under a sin nature and there's no way they can have the peace and Harmony that they believe they would like to have I'm glad that the Lord sent us a knowing trusting voice friends where would you go I you don't know how many mornings in my 5:30 chair that I raised my hands and thank God for this truth oh my goodness I I've heard my my boys you know speak favorably of me recently even talking about how grateful they were that a dad that and I I could say also I'm grateful I had a dad that kept me in the way and I'm here to tell you I have thought many times and I've said Lord what would I have told them how would I have directed my family who I love and my children what would I have said the world is in a hopeless situation and 33,000 different denominational ideas of the Gospel aren't working what would we do if God had not come down amen and brought a truth in this hour and the and the son of man Ministry to tell us how to get home and I'm here to tell you good news I have good news today I have the way home Hallelujah I don't want to live below my privilege amen and so I I thought about you know if I am have been preaching on opposing the Judgment of heaven and here's my question for you today that turns a corner do you think don't you think maybe this is a leading question but if the world has opposed the Judgment of Heaven globally don't you think there should be an opposition to the opposition amen amen and don't you think if no one will do it I should do it and if there's no voice in the world that will stand up and say Amen to every word I plan to stand up and say Amen to every word what do you plan to do bethl Tabernacle what do you plan to do Dad's and moms and young people what's your decision today teenagers I hope you'll arrive at our youth camp with a determination I pledge allegiance to the lamb to the Lamb of God I'm here to be a voice for his word amen I think that there should be an opposition to the opposition and I'm here to tell you that I have the answer on how to do that that's part of the corner turning today the answer is the operation in your life the operation of perfect Faith amen This Global opposing of God's words and everybody my goodness demonstrations we're no we're not short on demonstrations are we amen can I um can I go can I be politically incorrect today be okay so much opposition and marching and signs and everybody demonstrating to have the rights to everything that God is against yeah and I could just start right there and go down a long laundry laundry list you already know what I'm talking about many many things we could name marching holding up signs violently marching to obtain their rights listen friends do you understand that leoa means people's rights you understand that's the anointing of the God of this even age you understand that a real sheep a real lamb forfeits their rights that's why God is attracted to them that's why Jesus was called the Lamb of God because he had the right to live he had the right to everything he didn't want he was a human being brother Brandon said he didn't want to die he loved life he he had his Brethren he was young he had rights to these things but he but a lamb lays down its rights and that's why the dove canot fellowship with the lamb that's why when you get a wolflike attitude then the dove just takes his flight you don't become unborn again because that's impossible but the dove takes his flight and waits for you to get yourself right right sided and sometimes we find ourselves like Daniel on our hands and knees with our face down and but Daniel had to be stirred because he was at a time where he couldn't be sleeping he couldn't let human weakness put him face down and the angel kept saying Daniel Get Up Stand Up right now like Daniel you and I live in a world and very often time it's true that I find myself face down and I can't get up I want to get up I know I should get up I know I need to take a stand but the sometimes I need a presence to come among me sometimes I need that presence to come down and put his hand on me and get me up on my up get me up on my knees get me on my hands and knees and then say now stand upright I need to reveal the end time secrets to you amen and that's truly where we stand today friends we stand at a time just like Daniel he saw these things he said when will they be and the message was go your way Daniel this will not be this is for the end time there's going to be a people in the earth and this is who this is for and you're just going to write it in a book so that when they read it they'll take courage that there's one who can stand them up also that there's one that no matter how bad it gets and how terrible and how awful it seems there is a power there is a presence there is a place where you can go and you can live and you can dwell in the shikina glory oh you talking about strength you're talking about having the ability to prophesy for thou must prophesy amen everybody's demonstrating for rights that to everything that God is against and there and the other crowd is demonstrating against everything God is for that's right demonstrating against his chosen people yeah demonstr in against their right to live in peace and defend their lives yeah and the demonstrations are all over the world demonstrating against Common Sense people in nations are demonstrating against the Jews who would never be demonstrating against their own government had they been so savagely attacked by another country it is ridiculous and everybody with common sense knows it's ridiculous but God is for them and that's why Satan is against them amen and Satan is for the rights of people to do things that are ungodly in God's word and and that's why Satan is for it that's why Satan is for those rights because God is against those things and I hope that you are aware today young and old alike that God and Satan do not agree and God's family does not agree with this world I do not agree with what's going on in this world and I know that I've got to be a voice and I need somebody to lift me up into a presence Hallelujah something that can speak through me and it won't be my words anymore and it's not just words talk is cheap if there's no life action behind it that's you know that's that's where brother Brandon would say it like this and I thought this makes a lot of sense if you're not going to be a Christian please stop calling yourself one because that only brings a disgrace you see do you agree with that and that sensible makes sense to me see I and and so so if if I'm going to be a real Christian but that's why brother Brandon would say you know when he was dealing with as I was saying here last time when he was dealing with that uh the um the SBC that southern B Baptist convention there in the end of 1953 when they kicked off a program and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association would become indirectly helpful to it a million more and 54 and I told you how brother Brandon you know he he first said it like that first couple of times what's all this a million more and 54 he started saying it in the early spring around March of 54 and uh and and and then and then he thought and then he lost track is it 44 and and then one place he said a million more what's this million more and 34 I I mean 44 I mean whatever it is you know and then later he'd call it 44 and he ran with that for a long time and and and and what what we found that it was just get numbers at all cost it doesn't matter what we bring in and not that we're going to change anybody but just fill up the pews and that's what they call success and that's what God calls distress and that's why a prophet would say shockingly shockingly he would say listen I mean it does and it is scriptural we are Lively Stones right so the we're supposed to be shaped by the word amen that's the whole purpose that's what the Holy Ghost is given for is to cut and shape you into living stones for the living God's presence and so brother Brandon would just say in his Homespun Kentucky way if you're going to bring rocks in from the world and just set them in a church and you're not going to cut them and shape them and groom them he said you'd have been better to leave them out there because out there they know they're Sinners and they know they need God but you bring them inside a church and tell them they're a Christian just because they sit in a church and believe the man on Calvary and that and and they're not converted he said then they're worse off cuz now God can't tell them they they don't you can't get a man to repent if he doesn't if he thinks he's already born again see so I just say if we're going to bring them in here let's shape them let's mold them let's cut the St ownes I want to be that I want you to be that that ought to be in our marriages and our homes and our young people and I'm here to tell you that's what the Holy Ghost is given for and you are to seek it every day and you are to say every day Lord God let the Holy Ghost and Fire shape cut mold my life to whatever he wants it to be see and so if they're demonstrating for right to everything God is against and they're demonstrating against everything God is for then I think there should be a demonstration for his word amen and if he can't rely on his family right to demonstrate that who does he have amen amen he's not coming back corporately until Revelation 19 he doesn't sit his feet don't touch this Earth even in the rapture right we meet him in the air His Feet Don't Touch the Earth again when he when his feet lifted off from the earth at the Mount of Olives and he ascended up in a cloud and they stood there watching him and two men dressed in white said why stand you here gazing this same Jesus shall come again as you've seen him go he will come down he'll descend on the Mount of Olives it'll divide left and right and there's where he'll set up his headquarters see and that's an Extinction event for humanities coming down at the end to rescue his people and to set the world up under different Administration I want to be a part of that oh my and I want you to be a part of that see so so if he can't if he's not setting his feet corporately back on the earth until Revelation 19 then all he's got is his family and if he can't rely on his family to be a demonstration for God's word then who can he rely on I'm here to tell you something friends it's based on that thinking that I just said to you that I say this at the end of it it goes from being a privilege to being an obligation I want to say it again it's not just a privilege that you have the privilege to be the final voice to the final age we're so happy to say oh praise God I'm the final voice to the final age are you do you amen so well maybe not what will you will you start in this service today today and say Lord I never thought about it like that and I want to volunteer today I want to be a demonstration of the word of God and I'm here to tell you the only way that's going to operate is by Perfect faith and the only way you're going to operate perfect faith is to live in a perfect realm that's controlled by perfect love for God for his word and for one another without daily Fellowship you you you fall from something much like Adam you remember brother Brandon breaks that down and he says you know Adam he could you know he could say to a tree you I don't want you there I want you to come up by the roots and be planted over here and the tree under because Adam was an amateur God he had the power of creation and the tree would uproot itself and migrate over here and replant itself amen and if the wind wasn't blowing in the right direction and Eve wanted it changed Adam would just change it wind stop that direction blow in this direction it's a little chilly okay wind warm up two or three degrees and that's that's the power of God yeah he was an amateur God he had that kind of power but brother Bram explains and I don't have the quote here in front of me today but he explains how that when Adam after the fall Adam lost the sense that he had ever had that kind of power amen he lost Consciousness I think is brother bram's wording of it he lost that conscious he lost the understanding he lost the memory that he had ever had that kind of power and so I'm here to tell you something friends the Holy Ghost what do you think the Holy Ghost does it restores back that Fellowship that Adam lost in the garden see and so this is why Jesus could say not factiously Jesus wasn't joking when he said if you say to this mountain be moved and cast into the sea he wasn't joking but what he attached to it and he said and don't doubt in your heart amen but believe that what you've said will come to pass you shall have it and brother brandham even struggled with that and now it wasn't that brother brandham struggled with the fact that God could do that what brother brandham struggled with was the Bible he said but Jesus said if you say and that was his problem that's what he couldn't man if I say see and it took him a long time and he he had to go into the woods and you I've heard preached on it before and he he kept hearing that voice and it almost drove him insane how many squirrels three where should they be and then it happens a second time and brother brandham he he just gets so beside himself he said you don't know it feels like a Razor's Edge from Insanity you you hear something talking to you and he said I looked around I kept looking for that light that light you say that was that light real they took a photograph of it am it is in Washington DC I've seen it I went there and saw it it is in their they won't even let you take it they'll just hold it up to you to look at it it is scientifically proven to be a a snapshot of a supernatural being they have no explanation for amen he said so I'm looking for that light and what's always amazing to me is he told everybody years before that happened what it was and describe what it looked like and how it moved and and he said it' be over here and over here they wouldn't even allow people to take flash photography he said because it'll distract me I'll think oh there's the light oh no wait that's a flash bulb and and he would he would be talking to somebody in the audience I mean here on the platform then he would stop and you go man that's awfully Rude why is he he's like left this person and he's out here over the audience and he said I'm just following that light he said oh there it is it's over a colored woman over here sister right there and tell her her whole life oh it's back over here on a man yes sir you you've got this that and the other oh sir you didn't know you had that kind of Faith did you see and Jesus Christ stand on your feet Jesus Christ makes you whole and it happened tens of thousands of times see and so he he's there in the woods I mean looking for that light why would why wouldn't he yeah that's what it always guided him that's what it always depended on and he's he's so beside himself he starts crying out and I and and I just went back to the tape and heard it recently and he's crying out who are you yeah what do you want yeah I mean you you sometimes we get that way in life friends where life just comes and you're not aware that it's God moving in your life and you think oh it's a trial i' done something wrong or this is some kind of punishment and it's none of that it's God trying to draw you to somewhere let me encourage you today we're at the end of the Earth's history and God is looking for people to be a demonstration of his word hallelujah I just I just would say to you today throw up your hands and surrender and say me Lord me me me Hallelujah give me some clarity of why I'm here what I'm to do and I'm here to tell you that's only no able in the Realms of perfect faith and that realm is only accessible when the spirit of God is in your life and that's only happens when you're reading your Bible and every day and you're praying and you're in church and you're in fellowship with the Saints and you move trash out of your life out of your home out of your entertainments amen this is ABCs but this works yes amen see without daily Fellowship you you fall from something yes see and so God has ordained a chosen bride at the end time and I'm I I'm going to purposely close in the next 10 10 15 minutes max on purpose make these statements I'm just getting started truly God has ordained a chosen bride at the end time to operate at maximum potential Rejoice yeah that's his plan that's his desire say what is God's desire for me I just just told you now whatever that looks like God knows but I'm here to tell you everything that's happening in your life we're so close to the Finish Line we're so close to the change we're so close to that changing over friends you're going to cross over and and I know we worry about our bills and we worry about taxes and we worry about friends and we worry about school and we worry about a job and we and that's fine you need to be studious you need to plan you need those who who who who fail to plan plan to fail I uh that I learned that that's all true I've experienced that and and it and and I'm not saying we don't dot our eyes and cross our te's and check our p's and q's I get all of that we should do that but I'm here to tell you a prophet said that when you cross over the first thing that's going to go through your mind I'm glad a prophet knew the first thing would go through my mind he said the first thing that'll go through your mind is why was I ever worried amen amen where sometimes we sit and we grieve so bad over our life and he said one of these days you'll cross over you'll sit down under a tree and just laugh about it Hallelujah I like laughing Hallelujah I like laughing at the Devil I like laughing at my troubles I like saying no trouble's over hallelujah oh the devil's Bound for a thousand years trouble's over everything the devil took from me I got it back anyway Everything Jesus promised me that I lose nothing he said everything God ordained for me that even even if I lost it and even if I was complicit in its loss this message today comes to give it back to you all that God ordained for you to be so since it was purposed by God here's here's something to give you a little lighter step because I I I don't know what all you might be facing and even if you tell me I might not have all the answers you need oh I can always go back this at this stage of the game I've lived long enough I've been around the world have preached long enough that just about any problem you show up with I'll have an answer there's plenty of knowledge in the Bible and my experiences and I've seen what works and what doesn't work uh so no worries there but but sometimes friends you know as well as me you get in a situation and you need an answer that only God can give you you you get like job you get like Daniel you're on your hands and knees you're like job he said if I could just find where he lives he said I'd crawl up on his porch oh my said I'd knock at his door oh God help me and he said he wouldn't turn me away oh my the government might turn you away friends you thought you had might turn you away people who really love you might say I'm sorry I can't help you but this one can help you this one won't turn you away he said he won't turn me away he'll open the door and he'll put strength in me why because he's determined that I finish this thing and I'm depending on him for that I want to finish this thing and I want to finish it in Victory and I don't want to just stay down like Daniel a face down unconscious can't take it Daniel stand on your feet it's the end time and I need a demonstration of my word Shake It Off stand on your feet Hallelujah God no matter how bad your situation is I'm going to tell you something that's going to disqualify any need to worry about anything now you better know I got confidence in saying that I got something to say and I wouldn't say that lightly I'm here to tell I'm going to say it again I've got an answer for you that will that will render no matter what you're dealing with with it will render it as as of no effect on you amen amen just this simple little piece of knowledge that will be a super weapon for you to beat the devil over the head with that everything you've ever been through and going through and will go through because you will they were known of God ordained of God LED of God planned for by God equipped by God and he has every strength every peace every Power everything you need he already knew you say I failed he already knew you would fail he already knew you would repent he already knew he would pick you up again he already knew you'd go forward so I just say why don't you operate on what he knows and quit worrying about what you think and just say Lord God here I am and I'm willing whatever you can get out of me I just want to live near you I just want to be a demonstration for you I just want to be a vessel of Li a temple of lively stones that your presence can operate through because we have opportunities we have opportunities friends especially in opportunities as it as it relates to the use of perfect Faith amen and perfect love and all the benefits of the seven compound Redemptive names there's no need you could present that one of those names doesn't cover I'm here to tell you something friends every blessing that Jesus suffered bled and died and purchased for you at Calvary is yours for the taking Hallelujah will you accept that today it is yours for the taking or not it's up to you he won't force it upon you as much as he wants you to have peace that passes understanding he provides the place and tells you go there and you'll find it Hallelujah where is that in his presence where do I find his presence around his word get in his word you'll get his presence I'm here to tell you that Jesus was the word was he not and when the word went into the water what came to the word the anointing the presence the pillar of fire the Holy Ghost get in the word because you are the word and let the presence of God come to the word hallelujah and that is what will give you access to perfect faith and I and I'm gonna I'm GNA give you this right here and this is where we'll pick up next time come on Anthony bring your team and come onlu this is where you'll get into it next time stand up with me amen this is where we'll get into next time brother brandham I boy I I thought all morning how to say this I still don't know quite so let me just try to say it as best I can without you giving you the wrong thought the message perfect Faith the brother Brandon preached there in 65 it has been a um wow I can't use that word it has been a glorious sermon to me all my life and simultaneously a very Grievious sermon I mean that I love it so much and it paints a picture in front of me that I want so bad but I I guess I'm like Paul how to perform it how to do it how to get there I hear Brother brandham talking about what it can do what it will do what it and what and and this has to be in place and this has to be in place and this has to be in place okay thank you sir but how do I get that and this has to be in place okay thank you now how do I get that and this has to be in place thank you but please tell me how to get that and I the Lord put it on my heart and I just listened to it again and I had to take a deep breath because it always leaves me in that condition yeah it just seems like that it's something that's still must be out there and we're going to need some Supernatural thing to come along I'm here to tell you I found out that's not true right right I found out that all along I had the answer right under my nose and brother brandham tied it to this principle like a husband to His companion and a husband and wife and brother brandham says faith and love are kin folk and in other places he talks about how that they're how that these kinds of things are married to one another amen see and that God there it's not hard to get into this realm that I've spent an hour telling you about or 50 some minutes right G that I've spent this time telling you about it's not hard to get there it's not way off in the misty blue somewhere over a rainbow all it takes is your love affair with Christ coming together and I don't know how it never occurred to me and just explains the confidence that a husband has to a wife he loves and she has a confidence that because he loves and there's just and we're not just we're not just talking about Fidelity to one another we're we're talking about somebody that I know will be my friend somebody that I know cares about me and somebody that'll find something to do for me that I won't even have to tell her what to do she'll know what I like and I'll come across through the house and find it done and exactly like liked it and she knew that and she'll go to a certain place and something will happen and she'll see and it'll be a little surprise and she'll know somebody loves her I'm here to tell you something friends and that is what operates perfect Faith so I would say to you today don't struggle for perfect Faith check on your love affair with christl do that will you bow your heads all over the building I'm here to tell you I want to say it again again and again what is your heart toward God and His word we're not just talking about a love for God I a lot of people have that it's genuine it's absolutely genuine they have a great love for God but that's different than having the love of God the love of God comes by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the baptism of the holy spirit is not hard to get it's just a complete surrender of your whole heart and Life to God that's all it is and you repent that was only that was always the requirement and people try for years to get to that level and they never get there because they hold on to something that they won't repent and surrender and they try to come to God and try to get that seal of the holy spirit all heads bowed please I know I'm still preaching but all heads bowed and and it's not hard all it takes is a complete total absolute surrender where you say Lord you're like Jacob when Jacob got to that angel you've heard brother Jason say this so many times I've said it so many times when Jacob got to that point Jacob was so done with being Jacob when I found Christ I'll tell you something friends from my own experience when I found the Lord Jesus I didn't want to be me anymore and whenever I find me that one of that part of me that's still alive whenever I find him alive and he's a little too alive I like to take the word of God and conch him in the head and knock him back out I want to be a demonstration I want to be a walking demonstration of the love of God the faith of God the peace of God that the the the the everything of every potential that God has for me father thank you for this sermon today
